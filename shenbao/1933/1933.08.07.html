<p>㈠國際會員國旣决定法律上事實上均繼續不承認滿洲現組織、則其心目中係謂如果「滿洲國」表示欲加入某種普通國際公約、各該國應即就其權力所及、採取種種辦法、以阻止其加入、殊屬明甚、此種公約中有造成國際恊會或國際局所者、而欲參與此種國際團體、則固非加入創設此項團體之公約不可也、本顧問委員會對於各種普通國際公約、已加以研究其目的即在决定於「滿洲國」表示願加入此種公約時、國聯會員國以何種程序得以遵照國聯大會之建議、而有所動作、由此種立塲觀察、國際公約可分爲下列數種、）甲（非公開公約、加入此種公約、須咨詢原來各簽約國之意見、國聯會員國只須拒絕「滿洲國」加入、即爲遵照國聯大會之建議、（乙）公開公約、此種公約規定國家可以單方行通加入、但鑒於「滿洲國」之特殊情形、及國聯會員國對該組織所取之態度、本委員會爰决定建議、如「滿洲國」表示願加入此項公約、則收存加入證件之國家、應先向該約各簽約國咨詢意見、關於各該公約之一種或多種、如收存加入證件之國家咨詢、該約各簽約國、則國聯會員國而刻爲該約簽約國者、即可得一機會、遵照國聯大會建議、對於「滿洲國」之加入、表示反對之意見、收存加入證件之國家、亦即因咨詢之結果、對請求加入之國家、可以根據各簽約國之意見、而加以答復、特别關於下列各公約各國政府中、可有機緣向其餘各簽約國爲上云之咨詢者、厥爲比利時·西班牙·法國·義大利·荷蘭·瑞士等國之政府、比利時一九一三年十二月三十日簽訂關於設立國際商業統計局之公約、一八八六年三月十五日簽訂之國際交換政府文件、及科學文學刋物公約、一八九零年七月五日簽訂之設立國際公布稅則聯合會公約、西班牙一九三二年十二月九日在馬德里簽訂設立國際電信聯合會之公約、法蘭西一九一九年十月十三日、在巴黎簽訂之航空規則公約（第四十一條）一九二八年十一月二十二日在巴黎簽訂之國際展覽會公約、一九二四年一月二十五日在巴黎簽訂之設立國際獸類傳染病局恊定、一九二七年十月二十九日簽訂之設立國際化學局公約、一八七五年五月二十日簽訂一九二一年修改關於設立國際度量衡局之米突制公約、一九二六年六月二十六日開始在巴黎簽字之衛生公約、義大利一九零七年十二月九日在羅馬簽訂之設立國際公共衛生局恊定、荷蘭一九零七年海牙第五次和會簽訂之各公約、一九一二年一月二十三日在海牙簽訂之國際雅片公約、一九三三年簽訂之國際航空衛生公約、瑞士關於實業財產之公約、（關於保護實業財產聯合會之國際事務局、該公約於一八八三年初次締結於一九二五年修正、）設立國際保護文藝美術作品聯合會之公約、（該公約於一八八六年九月九日初次締結於一九二八年修正、）萬國郵政公約、）一九二九年六月二十八日在倫敦最後修正）一九二九年七月二十七日在日内瓦簽訂之改善戰地傷疫人員境况之日内瓦公約（即紅十字公約）關於待遇俘虜之公約、關於非戰公約（即巴黎公約）美國政府所居之地位、可視爲與收存各公約之國際聯合會會員國所居之地位相同）丙（在國聯指導下所締結之公約、因此項公約他國可以加入者、其大多數須經國聯行政院之决定、故參加在先之國家、無須另有行動、關於此項他國可以加入之公約、國際聯合會秘書長不能接受「滿洲國」之加入、至關於監督銷售軍械軍火公約、及禁用毒氣公約、則已請法國政府、於必要時、徵詢各參加國之意見、他如和平解决國際紛爭之海牙公約、國際裁判常設法庭規約議定書、均各載有加入之條欵、含有當然排除「滿洲國」之效力、此即與各公約之允許加入、須依照國際聯合會行政院决定者相同、參加在先之各國、無須另有任何行動、此外對於並非依照國際公約而設立之若干國際委員會及恊會、本顧問委員會亦曾就其組織法加以審查、以爲此項國際委員會及恊會、旣非依照國際公約而設立、則無論任何公立機關被允加入或派員參加、均不能因此而即認該公立機關業已取得法律上之承認、又即使此項國際委員會及恊會中有行政機關或私人團體之代表團某公立機關之被允加入或派員參加、亦不得視爲取得事實上之承認、但即以後種情形而論、國際聯合會會員國之參與此項國際委員會或恊會者、仍以盡量防止「滿洲國」代表之參與爲宜、</p>
<p>㈡關於郵政事項、中國政府曾於一九三二年七月二十四日通告、謂依據萬國郵政公約第二十七條規定、已請萬國郵政聯合會通告各會員國如左、㈠一切滿洲郵政暫行停辦㈡一切寄往歐美之郵件、嗣後將分經蘇彝士運河及太平洋運達中國政府、請各會員國之郵政局、對於寄往中國之郵件、亦採取同樣辦法、㈢傀儡政府所發行之郵票一律無效、凡貼有此項郵票之郵件包裹、當即視爲欠資、除此項中國政府之公文以外、本顧問委員以爲應僅請國際聯合會各會員國於發生「滿洲國」加入萬國郵政公約問題之時、注意二事、此二事維何、即「滿洲國」原非萬國郵政聯合會會員、及中國政府曾有上項建議是也、</p>
<p>㈢本顧問委員會於考慮通貨問題之後認爲一國國内貨幣、係一國國内法律所產生、而其實際利用、則與國際間買賣之任何有價物事相同、本委員會以爲如提議各國政府、應以立法手續、禁止「滿洲國」錢幣之交易、固屬非宜、惟對彼有正式外匯商場之國家、則亟願促其注意、採取有用方法、免載「滿洲國」錢幣之正式行市、</p>
<p>㈣國聯大會根據盟約第十五條第四項所通過之報告、固不禁止國聯會員國之國民與滿洲境内之任何人訂立契約關係、或接受該地當局之讓與或委任、然接受該項讓與成委任而相隨以來之特殊危險、各該會員國是否宜促各該國民之注意、本委員會以爲應聽各該會員國自决、鑒於大會報告書所產生之地位、與夫中國當局對於在現况下由滿洲當局獲得之讓與或委任是否有效之態度、各國政府似可將保護該項國民之困難、力加申說也㈤本委員會認爲凡於法律上或事實上未承認滿洲現有組織者、當不能認滿洲當局所發之文件爲護照、因此不能准其代表簽證該項文件、而就另一方面論、則若謂在「滿洲國」當局轄境之居民之願前往他國者、不應由所欲往之國家之領事領取身分證明文件或通行證、固亦殊無理由、又除非過境國之當局對於所欲往之國家之當局所簽發之證明文件或通行證願予簽證、事實上彼等大槪願簽發、則領取證明文件或通行證之同樣手續、自又可適用於過境國領事官自須查明請求人之眞僞、因此而利用「滿洲國」當局所發而自稱爲護照或通行證之文件等、亦自屬合理、以上各種考慮、非惟可用於尋常護照、即外交護照及外交或尋常護照之外交簽證、亦更應適用、</p>
<p>㈥本委員會認爲各國聯會員國在必要時、可以不抵觸大會所採之報告之原則下、作更易其在滿洲境内之領事之準備、在現况下派遣領事、不含有承認「滿洲國」之意義、緣該項代表、實爲呈報政府與保護僑民而設也、尤有進者、依照大會建議、各政府應提醒其所派之領事、應於可能之範園内、而尤於與滿洲當局接觸時、對於一切行爲、足以明被解釋或暗被解釋爲一種承認該當局爲滿洲正當政府之表示者、均應避而不爲、各政府在滿洲派遣領事官時、可以其對華之特殊法律地位爲嚮導、而於必要時、并可以中國某部份例如廣州之先例爲標準、蓋該處當局有時不承認中央政府之權力也、</p>
<p>㈦關於一九二五年日内瓦鴉片公約第五章、本顧問委員會向國聯會員國及非會員之關係各國建議、除非請求人按照該公約呈騐其進口證明單證明該貨之輸入「滿洲國」境内、並非爲用於違背該公約之用途、足使受請求之政府滿意者、則對於鴉片及他項毒藥品出口前往「滿洲國」境内之請求、槪不得允許之、出口核准狀一紙、應即與該項出口貨物相隨、但受請求之政府、不得再寄送此項出口核准狀之抄本於「滿洲國」、緣此舉或被解釋爲事實上承認「滿洲國」也、（六日中央電）</p>

<p>察哈爾問題。因宋哲元沙城之行。及在滬中委李烈鈞之出而居中接洽。有即就解决之趨勢。吾人讀廬山會後汪蔣聯署發表之儉電。於其中「内部即有問題。惟當屏除意氣。以求解决。對内用兵之說。非惟不忍言。亦不忍聞」之數語。而深明政府對察事和平處置之决心。馮玉祥之世電。詞氣雖激。惟其表示「微特無對内作戰之心。抑亦斷愛國而反以禍國之理。」亦足使人明瞭其非始終不覺悟者。以兩方如此之用心。更益以宋之周旋。内戰之能幸得消弭。固不待馮氏之正式宣告而可以知之矣。</p>
<p>「以前種種譬如昨日死。」吾人於過去七十餘日間之是非功罪。可以置之不談。但對局部行動實行取銷。儉電四原則障碍掃除後之察哈爾局面。則不能不貢獻吾人之意見。一中央今後應以國家整個行動。保障察哈爾省區之完整。北平軍分委長何應欽之所謂。「對外局部行動。非特無補時艱。反足危害國家。」其中自有若干之眞理。爲國人所贊同。惟察哈爾省區之必須保全。使不爲熱河之續。則又天經地義。不容有歧說者。察省東部界線。與淪陷中之熱河。犬牙相錯。其南部在形勢上實爲北平之脊背。保全察省。不僅爲將來之收復失地。留若干之便利。即其東障内興安嶺。以阻日人勢力之侵入蒙旗。南駐重兵於南口。使環處非武裝區域邊之平津。得一保障亦大有意義可言。馮氏崛起後之行動。誠不免使國人有所懷疑。而其收復多倫一舉。則無人加。以非難。何者察省之獲全非局部之問題。乃華北局勢之重要關鍵也。察事解决以後。政府其將用如何之方術。如何之力量。以保全此二萬五千平方公里之國土乎。此今日國人所極爲注意者也。二馮氏於國内糾紛解决以後。應避表面特異之行動。而爲將來効力之準備。孫殿英忍痛西去發表通電。有「此日牧馬桃林。暫隱身於漁樵。他年揮戈黃龍。再努力於疆塲」之語此吾人願爲馮氏誦之者。何應欽之三項辦法中。其第二爲「由宋率隊回察。馮將張宣一帶雜軍撤北去。俾便整理。」馮氏倘能善自整理其新收之部隊。使不爲民害。而成將來有用之勁旅。則此次之擾攘三月。庶不爲毫無價值也。　　張宣風雲。收束有日國人旣樂見國内糾紛之急速解决。更希望問題解决以後雙方能恊力以有補於時艱吾人亦秉此旨。稍貢獻其意見。至解决之應力求迅速。以免枝節之横生。則尤不待言矣。</p>

<p>銀爐業爲治銀鑄寳之所、創始宋代、蓋以外地來寳、每以成色不同、均須改鑄、或由銀條鎔鑄、或由小洋改鑄、銀爐即受銀行錢業之委託、以從事此項改鑄業務、如由銀行委託者、銀行合計大條銀與上海元寳之比較數、以大條交與銀爐、銀爐出一本票、交與銀行、作爲銀爐對於銀行之欠欵、其手續等於拆票、信用較厚之銀爐、出一本票即可、稍次者須有銀爐三家連環作保、限一二日元寳鑄成後、即以送交銀行、如由銀行委託以外地來寳改鑄者、其手續亦同、倘成色較優之外地元寳、銀爐尚須貼水二三兩不等如由錢莊委託者、錢莊預計所交元寳或小洋合上海成色元寳當得若干、與銀爐約定之後、限期一日、銀爐即以鑄成元寳交回錢莊、總之、鑄出之元寳、均須送公估局批定後、方可送交銀行或錢莊、</p>

<p>自政府命令廢兩改元後、銀兩元寳、市面不能流通、銀爐業因此天然淘汰、今以廢兩改元實行未久、各地銀子均絡續運滬、或解銀行錢莊、或掉換銀幣、因該項銀子種類各異、如馬蹄式四方式及零碎銀子等、其成色不一、以致無法判斷、必須經過銀爐之鎔化爲元寳、再經公估局估定成色後、方可掉換銀幣、及解往銀行錢莊、如廢兩成功、市面銀子絕跡、則銀爐業至是時勢必停業、</p>
<h3 id="c94">公估局公估方法 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>上海公估局、係安徽汪蘭亭所創設、爲銀錢業各商所公認、迄今已將百年、地址天津路江西路口、市上元寳、須由公估局批過、方能通用、批費每隻二分四釐、倘有偷漏未批、查出後、抽出批費、批過元寳、各家收回後、須一一復平、如有輕重、應即更正、否則公估局不負其責、至公估方法有二、㈠爲秤量、㈡爲秤色、秤量者謂之管秤、秤色者謂之看色、凡公估時、先由一人將元寳之中央凹部拭凈、交與管秤者秤量後、即將其重量以墨筆記入凹部、於是看色者、以其目力、判斷其成色之優劣、記入中央凹部、大約成色高者、批申水二兩七錢五分、成色低者、批申水二兩六錢五分、如重過四十九兩八錢者、每兩申五分、如成色在二兩六錢五分之下者不批、此係指上海爐房所出元寳、每隻以四十九兩八錢爲標準者而言、若各省所來之現寳、申水照通例批、如低色之寳、去水至一兩以外者、即不批也、倘看色者有疑義時、以方銑錐鑿入、以檢查其内部之成色、然後記入之、此等秤色、全憑其平日之經騐、</p>
<h3 id="c95">暫維現狀 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>廢兩改元實行後、銀爐業天然淘汰、而公估局原爲公估銀爐鎔成之元寳營業、與銀爐業密切關係、故隨之受影響者、如銀爐業停業以後、則公估局勢必無法公估、但我國數百年歷史沿用之銀兩、或爲習慣、全國波及、今政府雖已實行廢兩、但非一二年間、可完全廢止、故銀行爐業與公估局停止營業、一時尙難實現、今各業持銀子向中央國交通三銀行掉換銀幣、亦憑公估局之公估、故聞財政部將指定熟悉公估之人才監、督公估局公估、以昭大信云、</p>

<p>從「目之於色有同視一及一天視民視一兩句話推想起來，可以證明天賜給人一雙眼睛，原是想把人的視線統一的。可是因色態的變幻，事情的錯綜，如波譎雲詭，不可提摸；結果見仁見智，遂各不同。這雖可以說是眼睛的藝術化，然而已失却天賜人眼睛的本意了。</p>
<p>舉例來說；「西施」必從「情人」的眼中出，似乎不是「情人」，眼中就不會出「西施」了。骨牌一響，眼目便會清凉。現在中（中國之中）風西漸，聽說外國人也會打起麻將來了。這可見骨牌確有使眼目清凉的效用。上述二例，都是關於眼睛的奇續，誰也都知道的奇續，誰也都知道的。見仁見智，各有不同。換句話說，卽是各人的看法不同。「打打麻將，國家事，管他娘。」這也是一種看法。四萬萬同胞如個個能這樣看法，全國的視線倒可統一了。「安内攘外」，一時曾閙得甚囂塵上。這也是上下的看法各有不同所致。還有，多難可以興邦。然而「國難」二字，現在連各報紙上也難得見到的了。想必干戈已化爲玉帛，天下可以從此太平罷。這又是各有各的看法。紅樓夢襄的焦大，他看出賈府門前的一對石獅子是清凈的。看法的對否，且不管　；然而在個粗人，能獨見其小，也算不容易的了。</p>
<p>總之，眼睛這樣東西，實在是神秘得很。天要想反小民的視線統一，是萬萬不可能的。」天視」卽是「民視」。「民視」已這樣不同，不知一「天視」到底怎樣.安得呼老天而一問之?</p>

<p>— 僵蛹</p>
<p>馬路如虎,當中不可走。」在繁盛的都市裏，汽車發着怒吼，猛虎般四下馳騁，一個大意，平民的鮮血，給汽車的車輪一輾，立刻四下飛濺殷紅地塗在馬路上，添出一種眩目的顔色。汽車是有產階級代步的必需品，又快，又穩，並且十足道地是外國來路貨。於是大人，先生，買辦，富翁，摩登姑娘，現代少爺太多了，這般人物，都非坐一輛汽車，不足以見其高貴，祗要一瞧南京路上，自朝至夜，綿互地好似兩條天矯的毒龍，就可見汽車風行的可驚。</p>
<p>上海究竟是東方巴黎，平民的血，雖每日平均總有幾起塗濺馬路，但富人的鈔票一掏出袋，早已萬事皆了，因爲平民，在上海是過勝的東西。平民的血。越濺得多，富人的身價，越見高貴，也越顯得都會的文明。</p>
<p>汽車誠然是交通上最渴需的利器。於是内地到處都感到需要，南京，鎭江，無錫，杭州　，···一處處發現了這最摩登，最穩快的交通利器，又快又穩的馳騁在幾條擴展的馬路上面。</p>
<p>蘇州雖是具着古物典型的文化之邦，但觀前街，護龍街，景德路擴展之後，已具有上海馬路的雛型，新興的故城，汽車是最需要的文明點綴品，於是一班蘇州名人，具呈縣府，請求通行汽車，來振興市面，便利交通，救濟商業。重要啊！這摩登的請求。尤其在這酷暑的兜風的時期。</p>
<p>平民的鮮血，給汽車輾過，濺上馬路的色彩，内地的人民，也可一擴眼界了。</p>

<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>西瓜本來是夏令的解暑佳品，古人說得好···浮瓜沈李。在以前確然西瓜是夏天解暑的飲料，現在比較一年退化一年了。因爲都市之中，解暑的東西正多啦，像冰淇淋酸梅水，以及橘子水果子露等，都是解暑的，何必一定要去吃西瓜呢？這樣一來，西瓜一變而爲中等以下人家的解暑果品了。</p>
<p>今歳的西瓜，在蘇州地方，最高的價錢，只兩元左右，這幾天已經低了不少，祗須一塊多錢一担了。這一塊多錢一担的西瓜，他們鄉下人能賺得幾何？並且有的時候，還不能賣掉，依舊滿船而來，滿船而歸。農村的副產物，不能暢銷，那末農村的經濟恐慌，也一定發生了。所以看至西瓜上市，就覺得農村經濟的恐慌，這是事實放在我們面前，無可諱言的事。</p>
<p>從西瓜不能暢銷，就可以說到國綢的不能發展。因爲冰淇淋橘子水等，好像歐美運輸進來呢絨嗶嘰等物，西瓜好像是國產的絲綢。換句話說絲綢不能發展，好像西瓜不能暢銷，我們要打倒冰淇淋橘子水等，使得西瓜暢銷，使得農村經濟不至於十分絕望，有一線的曙光。我們應該愛用國產絲綢，和愛吃西瓜，挽救一些農村經濟破產。否則中國的農村，眞的要没落了。</p>
<p>愛吃冰淇淋橘子水等人們，你們多吃幾個西瓜吧。</p>

<p>第十二回　　寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍犧牲甘解甲戰士多情趙自强左手取下軍帽，右手在頭上連摸了幾把，微笑道··那是一言難盡。說到這裏，拿出掛表來看了一看，已經是没有時間再容許他說話了，就站起身來道··下趟回來再談罷。江氏心想，這位連長，無原無故的跑來坐一會子，只說要改行，你改行不改行，告訴我們作什麽呢？莫非知道我的意思，不肯要軍人作姑爺，他就要改行嗎？那也眞呌　了。他如此想着，也是一笑。趙自强一想，一說要改行，未來的夫人笑了，未來的丈母娘也笑了，這樣看起來，行眞是不能不改了。他肚子裏悶着這樣一個啞謎，就低了頭走着，一路想了回營去。他走在路上，聽到軍號聲，看到西苑那白色的樓房，以至於身上這灰色的衣服，覺的没有一樣不陳舊得令人煩膩起來。假使自已不改行。娶親以後，一個在家裏，一個在營裏，慢說那是誤了夫人的青春，自已娶媳婦爲什麽的？我若是改行，無論幹什麽事，兩口子總是可以在一處的呀。怪不得人家有姑娘不願嫁軍人，嫁了人是個空名，實在是在守空房呀丨他越想越對了，非改行不可！現在又不是什麽緊急的時候，辭差總是辭得掉的。爲着愛情犠牲這個連長罷，明天就辭職。他想着回到了連部，已經不再有一點猶豫，便想抵着那位上士來，商量如何請辭。至於平常所念到的什麽抗日，什麽報國，已經没一點放在腦筋裏。在這裏，我們可以看看他怎樣去找他的新生命了。（一五一）</p>

<p>— 虎頭</p>
<p>事實的來源是如此··我有一個朋友，因爲殺人嫌疑，在拘留所中被拘押了兩畫夜，承他告訴我拘留所中片斷的消息，現在把這話紀錄在下面，也算董綬經先生爲囚請命下的應時文章。（以下均朋友的話）</p>
<p>警察擦槍誤殺我店裏的老司務。當時我便打算呌警察出幾個錢，作爲老司務的喪費；由我再貼償些，作爲撫恤屍　之資。似乎好平安過去了？那知此時便有人出來用敲竹槓的手叚，要我多化幾個錢，試問我那　願意？蓋我之所以肯化些錢撫恤，爲着我是店裏的老鬭，司務們不幸死了，撫恤些錢，聊以安慰之心，並没有必須負的責任。我爽快地回絕了。他們便把「莫須有」的事，套在我頭上而入獄了。時間在兩星期之前。我被押的地方，是第十四號拘留所。只有毛五尺闊，二丈不到長的一所小屋子，屋上方有氣窗樣大的個小洞，裝着鐵栅欄。洞是給囚徒們呼吸的，鐵栅欄是防獄的。小屋子中間，先已有十五六個人，長衫黨，短跳黨，各色都有。出口的地方，僅容側着身子走的一扇小等，門内角置有木桶一隻，大小便就在此排洩。際茲夏令，屋小人多，臭氣薫蒸，不可嚮邇！只是這些人來此多日，正是「如入鮑魚之肆，久而不聞其臭。」意亦安之若素！這十五六人中，分别其犯罪種類，倒也五花八門，着實好看！共產，鴉片，紅丸，花會，姦非，洶酒打架，······各色都有；像我犯殺人嫌疑的，拾是絕無僅有罷！内中要算犯姦的最多，無怪社會新聞裏强姦誘姦等話，常常可以找見。上海眞是淫慾世界！這拘留所中，每天也得供給飯食。差不多把白天的時間，平分着供給兩餐，故吃的時候，覺得與平時很參差。這種飯，說他是飯罷，水分很多，幾乎分不出是飯。說他是粥罷，又不能在這許多水分中間照見自已的尊容，似乎不能說這是粥。論飯之色··黑旣不似，白又不像，大約在黑白之間，看去非常難過。菜是淡淡的捲心菜湯，怎麽呌人下咽？虧我拘留畵夜，能夠忍着飢不吃。如果再延長幾天，也只有學着甘地先生的絕食了。這裏也得供給鴉片，香烟·洋火，原是囚徒不需要的東西，所以取値很貴。鴉片泡每個起碼兩大元，香烟没有整枝看見，平日所不願吸的所謂香烟屁股，每叚銅子三十枚，洋火每根五十文。故凡吸香烟屁股一段，便需錢三百五十文，若是不幸被檢查的察覺了，還得加重刑罰。譬如甲乙兩人同吸一段香烟屁股時·甲吸則乙爲之打扇，乙吸則甲爲之打扇。這打扇並不是因爲夏天天熱，是要把香烟氣味扇出去，免再受罰。鴉片泡最難傳遞，據說：託送飯夫傳遞最可靠，因爲飯夫送飯時牢門開着，他得藏在碗底裏暗中運送。其計雖周密，可是用心也苦極了，大餅油條，本是苦朋友們聊以充飢的食物，所以他的價値，與外面一樣，吃莗菜的，似乎帶些貴族化色彩，所以取費較昂。也還不失爲公平的處置？</p>
<p>朋友說到這裏，適有人呌他聽電話·所以把話柄打斷了。</p>

<h3 id="c200">焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>焦先生是個我們中國立法委員，同時又是國醫館什麽長，他爲了六月七日中央政治會議國醫條例一案，發表了一篇告國人書，洋洋半萬言，我讀了眞是莫明其妙，現在且把我懷疑的地方，和焦先生同時和國人商榷一下，</p>
<p>焦先生說，「自從西洋的醫學傳到我們中國來，爲要避免和西洋的醫學混同起見，所以從主體上特别提出國醫的名辭來，這好比我國的文字，本來無稱爲國文的必要，因爲同時發見了英文德文日文等等不同的諸種文字，於是主體的提出國文一個名辭，是覺得非常的必要，國醫的意義，亦就是這樣。」我覺得這番議論，是不倫不類，醫學是自然科學，文字是人爲標記，那裏可以相提並論，講到文字的起原，當然也有象形·會意·諧聲·等等根據，但是到了後來，古文變成篆書，又變成隸書，又變成現在的楷書，丨今隸丨却專求便於日用，　把象形等等原理都被棄了，試問日月兩個字的現在寫法，還有什麽象形的根據呢，然而普通一般人們，誰都曉得日是太陽，月是太陰，用不着形象等等原理來說明，不但如此，若把古文的日字月字或者篆書的日字月字提出來，顚倒弄得不認識起來，可見文字是完全一種民族的習慣，是一種硬做成的人爲記號，我要說天是地，指鹿，絲毫不受眞理實物的拘束，至於講論醫學，却萬萬不能夠這樣隨意亂造的，兪理初癸已類稿說，中國人心七竅，西人四竅，中國人睪丸二，西人有四，等說，畢竟是痴人說夢，劉間李東垣朱丹溪輩說，中風是火是氣是痰，畢竟是腦溢血，結果，他們的治療中風的方法，說是治火氣治痰，畢竟不是治火治氣治痰，他們所用治療中風的藥物，說是治火治氣治痰之品，畢意不是治火治氣治痰的功用，總而言之，完全和眞理實物不對，換一句說，完全是捕風捉影的瞎說，那裏可以成就上件東西，一種學術呢，所以文字是跟隨習慣而來，儘可以各國不同，醫學是依據眞理爲歸，根本没有可以立異的地方，簡單說一句，英德文日文國文，是可以有的，英醫德醫日醫國醫，在學術上是根本不能成立的，請焦先生和國人，先要分别得清楚才是，焦先生說，「本來學術無國界，自無所謂國醫西醫，····祇能於世界人」</p>
<p>類確實有益，都該加以提倡，·····學醫的人們，應宜如何從學理上潛心探討」，這話我是十二分表同意，但是焦先生不知爲了什麽綠故，還要提出國醫一個名詞來，避免和西洋的醫學混同，這是我第一件要求焦先生說明的，我還有第二件的要求，是請焦先生不要忘却了自已所說的「從學理上探討」六個學者態度的正大主張，還要請國人也牢記在心，做個證人，</p>
<p>焦先生說，一却是國内醫界表示於我們的，學理上的研究，寥寥無幾，轉是業務上的排擠，一天一天地劇烈起來，不是西醫攻擊國醫，便是國醫醜詆西醫，····」我要問焦先生，西醫攻擊國醫的文字，那幾件不是學理上的研究，</p>
<p>那幾件是業務上的排擠，國醫醜詆西醫的宣言，那幾件是學理上的研究，那幾件不是業務上的排擠，請平心檢查一下，秤兩一下，統計一下，我可以大胆說一句，我們攻擊國醫，完全是學理上的研究，國醫醜詆我們，完全是業務上的排擠，因爲國醫是没有學理，只有業務，</p>
<p>焦先生說，「國家對於醫學的提倡，社會對於醫生的供養，無異父兄的提携子弟，保母的乳哺嬰孩，愛護之殷，可以說無微不至，醫生不於學術上有圖報稱，斤斤然以中西派别互爭雄長，國家社會，豈以是而屬望於國内的醫學家，」我要轉一句話說，人民對於立法院的期望，對於焦先生之供養，無異子弟的孝敬父兄，嬰孩之孺慕保母，愛戴之誠，可以說無微不至，焦先生不於學術上辦正趨向，悻悻然以國醫館長之故，詭辨爭雄，至不恤紊亂敎育系統，宰割行政機關，對得起國民的麽？</p>

<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>讀過歷史的我們。覺得東周的諸侯尊　。盛唐的節度專權。都是過去分割政權。破壞整個國家組織的榜樣。最近遜清末葉。各省督撫專政。以致朝綱一蹶不振。但是君主政治未替。一班的腦中。還戴着一個皇帝的尊嚴。不敢公然反抗。而要免去一個叛逆的罪名。所以事實雖多尾大不掉。一切任免。還不得不服從中央的一紙命令。民國成立。羣雄割據。以共和平等爲標榜的武人政客。便任意妄爲起來。他們腦海中。已消滅了人間信仰。他們心目中。已没有了整個國家。有實力的。只要增加槍數。有位置的。任他信口雌黃。今日一個政見。明天一個地盤。十多年來。我們民衆。可說一日不在水深火熱之中。國民政府。大家都信賴是能實行總理三民五權。確立一有組織。有希望。可大大發展的一個國家。今後能自立圖强。可是其間。政見依舊鑿枘。武力各持一方。作苛論的。說是中央政令。還不夠孫傳芳時代的廣及五省。這是何等可痛的話啊。這種廢話。現在暫且不論。不過國民政府成立後的政潮突兀。各地分割政權現象。業已數見不一。我們腦中還没有磨滅的。武漢。東北。西北。南方。西南的各種舉動。或明顯的别組政府。或暗藏的攘割政權。我想結集在當今中央政府旂下的在位諸公。也當有痛心疾首的感觸吧。他們這種舉動。第一是忘了整個國家。第二是蒙蔽了名利。第三是被一班政客包圍。自已失了趨向。所以各有各的主張。各有各的行動。各保各的地盤。各張各的勢力。弄成個貌合神離的現象。怪不得日本人口口聲聲在</p>
<p>國聯席上。說我們是没有組織的國家。試仔細把他這句批評來解釋一下。不是</p>
<p>說。亂糟糟問雜分子的一個酒肉弟兄結集嗎。你想可恥不可恥呢。現今中央政府中。我深信他久留海外。洞見　結的明瞭分子。當不在少數。但是因人成事。或積習極深者，在所難免。還有明知康莊大道。偶一迷途者。更有以私人好惡。而藉作政爭工具者。於是乎政令便無標的。而建設亦難進步了。中央國醫館的成立。我輩已覺得地平綫上。怪石嵯峨。但因牠是個學術機關。而學術的。自由研究。各國例所不禁。况且學術。尤其是形下實用的科目。不單憑口說筆記。還須趨重物質。拿出證據。所以研究有得。便是成績。不得成績。雖有若無。讓牠去罷。不料最近。有許多中央要人。不知忽然觸了什麽電線。一時忘記了國家行政組織。和學術的一貫系統。亂糟糟地。要把没有根據的中央國醫館。授以政學全權。他們没有想到政權。是不可輕易分割。政令是不可隨意授人的一層。也没想到在管理全國文化的敎育部中。可分割牠一部政權。交給没有法律上地位的中央國醫館管理。也没想到。在管理全國民事的内政部中。可分割牠一部政權。交給没有法律上地位的中央國醫館管理。唉還成什麽國家體統。還像什麽統一政法呢。這不是和過去的武漢。東北。西北。南方。西南的各别組立政府。擴張自已一部勞力同樣嗎。我倒還要請問一句提案諸公。倘然這個提案。在立法院通過了之後。這批中醫。旣不屬中央政府裏全國政治的行政院管轄。不都變了我國人了嗎。提案諸公。没錯了念頭嗎。中央國醫館。不可和外國領事館。同樣看做的啊。前天讀了焦易堂氏。在首都報上發表的告國人書。說來說去。總是老生常談。說西醫專重物質哩。說中醫擅長治病哩。說中醫學說譬如列不出算式。他治病成績。還是答數不錯哩。說某某的病。西醫都治不好。得某郎中一治而愈哩。說某要人。深信西醫。所以背疽至今不愈哩。說衛生部耗了許多國幣。霍亂依然猖獗哩。說中國人生活程度。不配請西醫哩。總而言之。他主張要保存中醫。但是保存中醫。全關學術問題。不過他文章。確做錯了。提出的國醫條例。完全將學術和行政。混在一氣。并且要把這政權。交與行政組織上没有地位的中央國醫館。你想怎樣使得。我想立法院諸公。對於這類的行政系統組織。素有研究。當不致盲從吧。再退一步講。立法院諸公。倘然也表示同意。那末要免紊辭行政系統之嫌。不可不先有下述之確認。㈠確立中央國醫館之地位。使有所統屬。㈡中央國醫館。仍爲學術研究機關。照舊存在。另設醫政部。與各部並立。使專理國醫行政事宜。㈢將國醫之關於行政方面的事項。交内政部。擬訂專條。㈣交衛生署。實施國醫條例。照這樣。先使國醫有所統屬。那末行政設施。才可有所根據。不然。立法院自身。恐也有所不便吧。</p>

<p>（作者啓事）本欄係一種問答體例，並非通信問答。讀者請勿誤會致空勞函牘埀詢也。</p>
<p>㈩㈣痢疾（Dysentery）（A細菌性）問痢疾，是腸内的傳染病嗎？答是的。這種病原，也是侵　腸管的。</p>
<p>問痢疾可以分做兩種，一種呌做細菌性痢疾，就是因爲痢疾細菌侵入大腸内而起。一種是僞足喜性的痢疾，就是因爲痢疾僞足喜（Amoeba）侵入腸内而起。問細菌性痢疾的病原因菌，怎樣傳佈開來的？</p>
<p>答夏季或秋季，因爲飲食不愼，把含有病毒的物品和飲食物吃進口内而侵入腸内，往往一時流行的傳佈開來。問這些物品和飲食物，怎樣會含圾病毒呢？</p>
<p>答凡物品曾經痢疾病人用過的，或飲料水中受了病人的排泄物所污的，或食物被蒼蠅叮過的，都含有病毒。</p>
<p>問細菌性痢疾傳染之後隔幾天發得發病。在這時期内，病人並不感覺怎樣，但也有起食慾不良，腹部不快，大便不整等的。</p>
<p>問發病的時候怎怎樣？</p>
<p>答最初起輕度的腹痛，同時有數回的泄瀉，稍有發熱。後來大便回數更增加，一天數次到數十次，失掉大便的性狀，含有黏液血液或膿液，放出惡臭。普通以大便混血液的稱爲赤痢；含黏液或膿液的，稱爲白痢。大便回數，無論多少，其一回量不過十克到二十克。排便前發腹鳴，和疝痛，然後有急迫的感覺（裏急後重）。</p>
<p>問病人的體温怎樣？</p>
<p>答病人體温稍數上昇··如果病部波及到小腸下段的時候，便要起高熱，甚至呈現腦症狀，很像傷寒。（未完）</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第五章醫藥之行政</p>
<p>第三節近年之政令</p>
<p>我們再看政令上。對於新醫名稱的給予。以及無限制的任舊醫登記。倡辦有名無實的國醫館。那些事實。愈加可以證明我上面所說的「畸形政見」。不是臆測。一方面也可以知道衛生署。已不爲現政府所畀倚。而處於說不出的痛苦地位。然而話再說回來。現在衛生署的處處太重新大陸化。也未始不是引起舊腦筋大老不歡的原因罷。</p>
<p>在北京内務部和淞滬商埠時代。都稱新醫爲醫師。到了特别市衛生局。已在醫師之下。加上括弧。註稱西醫。似乎有人。要確定我們爲外國貨了。衛生部成立。又稱爲醫師。而國府條例。又直稱西醫。似乎有當我們外國人的意思了。考試院索性在醫師上面。再加西醫二字。呌西醫醫師。那是將來定要有國醫醫師的先聲。内政部新訂變通辦法上。倒又稱醫師了。照這樣看去。將來有没有更新的名字出來。尙難逆料。於是滑稽的朋友。就是「衛生署。好比老家庭中一個没有權柄的姨太太。管着一班如喪考妣的科學分子。丨稱孤哀子。而族長。偏以爲科學醫是出嗣兒子。只該稱降服子。留着名分。給嫡派的國醫於是一面稱孤哀子。一面儘改降服子。終於算由西席先生的考試院。說道。稱他們爲降服孤哀子罷。」照這位朋友的比方。簡直政諸公。不會寫訃聞了。那也未必呢。</p>
<p>至於官廳對於新藥界。在十七年特别市衛生局。就雷厲風行。令每一個藥房。都要有正式藥劑師配藥。然而事實上莫說藥劑師不夠用。即使夠用。都也有許多困難。所以在上海市内。當時就由各藥房遵令聘一個藥劑專家出面。而其餘學徒。作爲助手。一面擬辦補習班。而使那些學徒式配藥師。可以得藥師執照。如今衛署。要通令全國照辦。當然人材愈感缺乏。而變爲令出不行。索性連上海的補習班。也不聽說起了。</p>
<p>對於成藥商。另有管理成藥規則。但是在租界内製造的滑頭藥。竟愈多。而類似所謂國藥的新製品。更無法取締。因爲國藥舖。根本不大受衛生局的管理。）未完（</p>

<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>）二十四（流產和早產的處置）甲·流產和早產（妊娠一二個月後的流產，大都在醫師或助產土尚未注意之中，不知不覺的流下，亦有一種還未知道懷孕，竟去出門旅行，到了後來，月經忽較尋常爲多，這一種；往往是極早期的流產。</p>
<p>什麽呌做流產？就是指着妊娠七個月以前，胎兒尚没有子宫外生活能力的早期分娩而言。什麽呌做早產，就是胎兒雖離母胎，亦能生活，但是尚未達到分娩期，就已產下，所以穩爲早產，按照統計，經產婦的流產早產，比較初產婦來得多數。現在有個統計表，根據一千二百二十六個產婦當中，發現的多寡，作爲比較如下：</p>
<p>）產婦别一流產一早產（初產婦一三一人一四八八經產婦一二四一人一九零六人最容易流產的時期，大都在妊娠三四個月左右，來得頂多，此後漸少。妊娠初期的流產，竟有本人出於不知不覺之間，輕輕的了事。至於一個月以上三個月以下，那末··就有相當的危險，假使遲到五個月左右，方才流產的話，往往要起大出血，若患急性貪血或心臓薄弱的人，亦有因此絕命的危機，還有一種所謂不完全的流產，只不過流出卵胞，所有胞胎等，仍然殘留在内，這也很危險的一回事，不可不由醫師，施行手術，必須先完全取出，方可無憂。</p>
<p>（乙·流產的預兆和處置）流產的預兆，在妊娠一個月左右，隨同月經流下，乃在不知不覺之中，並無任何預兆。若在妊娠二三個月流產的話，最先流下混有血痕的粘液，約經五六日或十日，就象氣分不舒，繼忽又覺腰痛，腰痛不背休止，又起陣痛，但是因了這種出血，是否可以决定指爲流產？　　　必盡然。總之；延醫治療，實在刻不容緩，若能如此，旣可幸免於萬一，而且還有注射防止的方法。</p>
<p>對於流產應急的處置方法，應該靜心仰臥，安逸精神，並將冰袋置在下腹部，用脫指棉綳帶塞在局部之處，至於流產的治療，乃與正常的分娩，並無異致，但在應行注意之點，更應嚴守。　　（丙·流產不可忽視）一般人對於流產，往往有輕視的傾向，在事實上雖不致大碍生命，但因此亦有易起子宫内膜炎或實質炎等患，而成不妊症的，頗覺不少。又因胎盤和卵膜的一部份，殘留在子宫之内，因此而起產褥熱，或惡性的脈絡膜上皮腫，就是子宫内發生惡劣性的腫塊，以致喪失生命的，亦屬不少。</p>
<p>（丁·流產早產的原因和預防法）流產早產，原因很多，其中發生於單純原因的較少，大部分都係種種原因凑合而起，所以做妊婦的人，不可不有這種常識，以便留心周到。現述大要如下··</p>
<p>主要的一種原因，乃是胎兒死亡，胎兒死亡的原因，也有種種，但不問任何原因，倘使一朝死亡的胎兒，必由母體排出。</p>
<p>妊婦患有肺炎傷寒霍亂瘧疾丹毒等高熱的傳染病，或曾患賢臓病·心臓病·脚氣·肺癆·白濁·梅毒等病。　　妊婦有子宫内膜炎實質炎腫痬子宫後屈等患。</p>
<p>胎盤的位置異常（就是前置胎盤）羊水過多症脐帶的捻轉雙生兒等變化。　　妊婦受有外傷，就是因爲跌墜衡突爭閧等情，受有激動及損害，或用熱水的脚浴坐浴，及海水浴，又如長途路䟦涉，舟車勞頓，異常的精神感動，意外的驚嚇，過激的性交等情。</p>
<p>○妊娠中的服藥，也爲流產早產的一種原因。</p>
<p>以上各種原因當中的梅毒賢臓炎子宫後屈症子宫内膜炎腫痬等患，如不完全根治，那就容易變成習憤性流產或習慣性早產，勢必反覆發生，貽患無窮，成爲永遠絕嗣的惡果。</p>
<p>預防方法，除先明瞭上述各種主要原因外，若在流產預兆發現之時，急忙施行相當的處置，那末；或可免除此患，這種相當的處置，除照上述的應急處置外，尚須避去各種興奮性的食物，並使精神肉體，不可疲勞。假使幸而轉危爲安，化險爲夷，那末；此後的攝生·當然要格外愼重了。</p>

<h3 id="c205">遺忘 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>我們有一種莫德，呌做遺忘。遺忘是各個人各國人都不缺少的，　我們中國人特别擅長，遺忘得快而且遺忘得乾乾凈凈。凡有什麽不如意的事情，當其時雖則也並不置身事外，看作遇眼烟雲，事後却總能淡然置之，若無其事一般的。卽使不是此種令人覺得討厭的失意事情，也能過了些時候而不知不覺遺忘了，比方做官的人常會忘了在野時代的督言，少壯者多半忘却青年時代的抱負，做了敎師就忘了他自已做學生時的一切。</p>
<p>一種苦痛，倘使常常掛在心上，終朝愁眉不展，戚戚然如喪考妣，豈不是令人生趣全無，而且憂能傷人，萬一眞個造成疾病，豈非自傷天年，所以遺忘是不可少了。能遺忘，就能樂天，樂天知命必能安心立命，於是身修家齊國治天下太平可立而待也。中國之所以還不能十分太平，大約因爲遺忘還不能徹底之故。并且據心理學家言，人常常把苦痛的，不歡喜的遺忘，愈不喜的忘得愈快，那麽大約中國的一切還不曾糟到極點，而令人民得迅速忘却，以致不能就達到至治之境。於是致國家社會於太平之道，這裏也有些暗示，我相信目下的措置設施是合於這大道的。</p>
<p>遺忘之爲美德，另外還有一種意思，因爲把舊的忘却了然後可以接受新思想。倘使我們頭腦子褒全裝滿了古舊陳腐的不快意的東西，我們何能容納接受一切新式的快意的呢？一方面新的事件進來，也能促成舊事件的遺忘，如有五三濟南案我們便得忘却五卅的南京路案，而有了九一八，一二八，我們非得忘却五三事件不可，來了熱河的失陷以及華北的停戰恊定，我們更得忘却東北原是中國的領土。一方面有了建設獎劵五十萬元的希望，閘北砲火下的損失便得置諸腦後，而培養國力的字限也要把長期抵抗逐出記憶的。我相信，一定還有更新式更快意的事件出來，使我們興奮一下而把舊的全忘了，連我們是中國人也忘了。遺忘也有個對頭寃家，是事件的反覆與提醒，比方五三是日本人，九一八和一二八又是日本人，於是日本人之爲中國人之仇敵非經長時的努力，不能使人遺忘了。又如内戰三月一戰，隔不了二月又戰，於是内戰被人民深惡而痛疾之了，像四川的百姓，現在一定還不曾遺忘内戰的。中國人是喜歡太平的，喜歡遺忘的，但有些人偏要反覆那行爲而不使人遺忘，那是中國人之大仇敵，能夠推陳出新逐一度下去的，才是治國的大材。報載巴比塞調查團將來華，想九一八事件，我們全都忘了，李頓報告書也成廢紙了，而他老先生不遠萬里而來，來提醒我們這不快意之事睡，一定會遭受我們全國人民反對的，正像睡夢中的人，不喜歡給人呌一樣，我想這總有一事件表現出來，我們的確有遺忘之美德，而且酷愛這個美德，一定在那時可以充分顯露的。</p>

<p>在胡適「五十年來中國之文學」裏，他曾經介紹貴州的大詩人鄭珍。鄭珍，字子尹，遵義人，生一八○六年，死一八六四年，著有「巢經巢詩集」等書。胡適說他的詩集裏，有「無數悲哀的詩料」。　年在鄂，曾經在友人處假得原刋本的詩後集，並擇鈔了若干首。當時我最愛的，是從卷三「二苕季弟哀詞二十首」裏選出的九首。詩云··</p>
<p>惡命平生此盡頭，豈徒斷手直春喉。天心門運從何說？氣湧如山涙不流！</p>
<p>衰門人物總堪憐，磊落無人及汝賢。縱有後生能似得，廟成鬼老待何年？</p>
<p>鷄鳴呼我屋西頭，永訣空餘息在喉。目指三兒含哽付，一生兄弟片時休！</p>
<p>傷心吾道老尤非，長餓何由手足肥？致汝苦生還苦死，歛時猶是阿兄衣！</p>
<p>屢期遊蜀屢徘徊，前月無端去又回。祇說相生有天意，豈知爲要送終來！</p>
<p>颯秋濤風雨哀，繞山松樹盡渠栽。一根不死吾弟死，不爲先墳都斬來。</p>
<p>事我如兄嫂似嬭，酸腸汝嫂擘胸時。最是一一聲聽不得，萬方想盡不能醫。</p>
<p>季虎朝來絕怒音，遺孤滿目我何心？登床共此俱亡慟，吹角奴婢子敬琴。</p>
<p>四十三齡亦考終，固知死樂勝生窮，思量不作多時别，我已今成六九翁。</p>
<p>其後來海上，購得「古香黃氏古愚室輯印」的「巢經巢詩文全集」，從「附錄」各文中，知道他的一生，是極其悲苦的，「遭時之亂，極生人之不堪，流離轉徙，至子窮且死」。在這十幾卷詩裏，有很多悲慘的當時社會史料，祗以怱怱讀過，現在簡直想不起了。他日有暇很想再讀一遍，把這一類的材料整理出來。</p>

<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>麥都收割了。把在麥場上打出來的麥粒全堆進了倉，我不由得噓了一口氣，肩架上像輕了不少分量。</p>
<p>叼着旱烟管，在柔和的五月晚風裏走着，想着。我的心是歡樂的。</p>
<p>「今年的收成眞不壞！誰都没想到老是下雨的天氣也會有這種好收成。要不是在　繭上虧了本，今年這上半年的生活可就用不着愁了。」</p>
<p>我對自家兒這麽說着。心裏邊想到了許多事··今年的麥價縱使有折扣，七塊幾角一擔的價錢是逃不了的，往年不是還賣到八塊多一擔嗎？我這兒收下來的麥，是有三十擔，三七二十一，整整可以賣二百塊錢。有這一筆錢，不但李老爺那兒三分錢高利的債可以歸還，就是當在當舖裏的單夾衣服也可以贖出來了，老婆吵了多時的花粉衣料也有了，說不定還可以代小牛子買一些要貨。</p>
<p>可是第二天早上，地主陳大爺親自下鄉來收租了。一進門，就綳着驗說··</p>
<p>「今年年成好，每畝田裏要收七斗麥。」七斗麥！我擱不住嚇了一跳。這不是要奪了我一家兒一半衣食嗎？我只有苦着臉衡他哀求，請他減一些。老婆也牽着他衣服求告着，眼涙水兒快要掉下來了。</p>
<p>陳大爺的心腸眞比鐵還硬，他别轉了臉，鼻根子一　，就喊同來的手下人量麥。钉在一旁爭辯着，搶奪着，老婆哭着要說要上弔，統没有用，麥終於給他們理走了！麥倉矮了半截。麥粒撒滿了一地。給他們理去的麥足有十擔。</p>
<p>幾隻雞跑了來，亂啄着地地上的麥粒。我心痛地衡牠們踢了一脚，成夥兒全飛散了。其中的一雙怪呌着，撲到小牛子面門上去，嚇得小牛子哇的一聲哭了起來。</p>
<p>隔壁的王老大怱然走過來，約我一同上城去問麥價。我心裏邊又有些兒高興了。剩下來的麥還有二十擔，只要價錢跟往年一樣，也可以　一百幾十塊　，先還一增價，再省　　　　　，這生活是勉　强可以過的。</p>
<p>我就這麽　　滿　希望的止了城。好容易走至聚　米行門口，我的心格外　跳得厲客，連胳膊都有些顫抖。我眼睜睜的　着王老大走到米行的櫃檯前去問···</p>
<p>「麥價賣多少？」</p>
<p>「兩塊半。」</p>
<p>兩塊半！一個暴雷轟在我耳邊，我的頭腦完全昏晕了。天喲！這是怎麽一種價錢！我是在做夢嗎？我彷佛　見李第爺在逼着我討債，老婆在吵着要花粉料，小牛子在哭着要要貨，　多當在當舖裏的單夾衣服在我眼前　蕩着。</p>
<h3 id="c208">賽珍珠的新著 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>前幾天看見「大地」的譯者宜閑寫了一　交章介紹賽珍珠，今天我且根據紐約時報來介紹她的新著「原配」</p>
<p>「原配」是一個短篇小說集。作爲題名的這一篇可說是她以前的長篇小說「東風西風」的具體而微的作品，又說的是受了西方影響的丈夫，和舊式傳統之下的妻子。不過「東風西風」的結局是圓滿的，「原配」却是悲劇的。丈夫從外國回來，妻子用盡努力，也無法使得太夫高興。他覺得新生活是開始了，她則只知道自已的世界，所以終於自殺。</p>
<p>第二個短篇「老母」也說的是新舊的　爭。這篇說的是老母的不幸。兒子在外國受敎育，娶了一個摩登少女爲妻。一對小夫妻覺得老母生活方式太不行，老母也以爲他們倆太荒謬。「前天」則說的是另一問題。一個年　的學生從外國回來，　出他的家庭和　　成都會犧牲他們自已的　適生活來增高他的地位，希望他能夠報答他們，而他却想替人類服務。究竟　是報私人的恩呢，還是爲人類服務呢，他是　　於歧路了。</p>
<p>此外還有三個短篇··有一　是嘲　一個西人不理解華人，又有一　是柴霍甫式，　到　村夫婦的　婚生活，還有一驚請的是法　小布　喬亞婦人嫁輸一個窮中國人，不能夠理解他的高尙的數　。</p>
<p>還有幾個故事是在「革命」一個大題目之下的。第一篇可以　「大地」的　者發生特别興　的，因爲這就是王龍故事的　　。另一　是寫一個革命女子在行刑的幾小時的感想。「神父安得利亞」是敎士的故事。</p>
<p>最後四個縮寫，賽珍珠使我們感到中國農民抵抗水災和饑饉的複雜心理。</p>

<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>子的春的太太冠蘭老五，就是這樣一個性急的人，一二八那一整天，她正在家裏忙着，鋪排年夜飯。說到「忙」，也許並不是誇張的話，因爲這頓年夜飯的菜單子，不僅是考究的，並且是複雜的，其所以如此者，爲的就是欵待姚雍孫。老五近日時常聽見雍孫對子春談過福州菜的香脆清鮮，自已又記起雍孫從前很愛蘇州船菜和點心的酥甜精美，所以她前幾天一經約好了雍孫來當年夜飯的光，就托人找了蘇福兩帮的名廚，在一二八這天到自已家裹來　餁，一面自已遠從旁提調指揮。並且她是用欵待「自家人」的方式來欵待雍孫的，所以除了雍孫之外，只約了雍孫一個最得信任的清客洪遂吾，和自已在「二百八十一號」結識的兩個小姊姊，連同自已兩夫婦一共五個人作陪。</p>
<p>傍晚的時候，她從子春口裏曉得租界已經宣布戒嚴。這件事不免呌她有點擔心，怕的就是雍孫不到；後來她看見門外那條重慶路上的情形並不慌張，夜市依然是萬家燈火，因此心裏才寛了一半。不久，那兩個女客都先後來了，她們各自談起各自在外面看見的情形，就都斷定至少在租界西區是和往常一樣的；然而她們對於當天請的那位首座，却始終候着，始終心躁而形靜地候着。一直到了八點鐘光景，雍孫才由遂吾陪着走進門來。</p>
<p>這頓年夜飯大槪吃了兩點多鐘才告結束。雍孫對於老五的烹調甚爲稱贊，每逢他說出一兩句稱贊的話，就有遂吾極力從旁證出値得稱贊的理由，所以座上的談鋒，倒也十分流暢。</p>
<p>後來，老五就邀他們都到樓上去抽烟了。子春陪着遂吾和兩個女客閑談，老五陪着雍孫　在烟榻上替他做火；這樣，他就慢慢地向地問起這一年賭况的虧盈來。「今年大槪要輪掉四千光景！」老五說「那末，」雍孫說，「也不算少！」</p>
<p>「過年嗎！七扯八拉總算弄好了；不過過了年以後，倒還没有辦法。」</p>
<p>「唉！」雍孫若有意若無意地這樣嘆了一聲。</p>
<p>「並且七扯八拉也總歸是還要還人家的！」</p>
<p>「那末，總有想法子才好。」</p>
<p>「想法子！三少，除非是你！她」說到這　抬頭向雍孫瞟了一眼，「要是了春，他的交遊太少。」</p>
<p>「這倒也怎樣難！慢慢·····今天經是廿一了，我可以邀一班朋友友趁着新年頭上替你頑這麽半個月！這樣，除了開銷總還可以長一個好看的數目！」</p>
<p>「那末就眞好！三少，眞要謝謝你。不過怎樣頑法？」「那還不是老套頭！攤，牌九，自然都不可少····要是場面好，也可以有三十六門。」</p>
<p>「那末就眞好了！「三少，眞要謝謝你。不過在那裏頑呢？」</p>

<p>布成於紗，紗成於棉。欲成優良之布必有優良之紗。欲成優良之紗，必有優良之棉。故原棉優良，爲成優良紗布之主因，此就成品之品質言也。至於紡工程，尤有莫大關係。盡以惡劣之棉，或織維長度不合標準者，紡高支紗線，則回花加增，工作困難，生產旣必低降，紗之成品亦因强力不足而惡劣。影響製織工程，發生故障，有產額不佳，織物次惡之缺憾。故在紡織工程上所需之原棉，卽所謂優良之棉者，所具之要性凡七。㈠色澤白亮，㈡純潔不雜，㈢富於天然撚度，㈣細長柔軟㈤長度整齊，㈥具有空中組織，㈦當於强彈力，已詳見拙作「紡織工程所需棉織維之要性」。茲再就人文進化與產業合理化立塲、試述吾國今後所需之棉質於後。</p>
<p>（一）今後人文進化所需之棉質人類文化日進，物質享受，亦由質而日進於文章、身之衣、已非僅能禦寒蔽體者，足壓其慾望。於是粗厚之布，需求日减。精細之布，以代粗厚之布者，則爲量日增。成紗成布之原棉，亦隨時代推，漸趨精細。國原棉，織維粗短，不能爲高支紗線及精細布疋之製造。紡織廠爲迎合時代要求，又不能不爲精細紗線之紡織。無已，取村於外，以補其缺，茲將最近四年全國紗廠銷棉百分率，分類比較於後··中棉美棉印棉埃及棉其他十八年六八·二五一三·六六一七·九九○·○四六十九年六三·一一一三·六○二二·七六○·二一○三二二十年四九·六七二六·四三二三·二九○四·三一八廿一年五二·一三三八·五八八·八一○·○三觀上表中棉消費量由十八年之百分之六八二五，减爲二十一年之三八·五八，美棉與埃及棉消費總理，則由一三·七二增爲三九·○三，二十年外棉之總用量逾於國棉。二十一年亦幾與國棉　。此雖國内連年荒歉，棉收低落所致。但中棉品質較遜，不能織製精細紗布，尤爲用量低降之重大原因。近來織維細長之美棉埃及棉用量日增，粗短之國棉印度棉用量日减，事態益顯。工廠年購三百五十餘萬担外棉，價達關元一萬四千餘萬兩。製之爲布，又多銷售於農村。無異將原棉入超之損失，取債於農村。農村一方因所產原棉不合紡織廠需求，難得善價。一方因衣物負担加重，不與所生產者躋之於平。於是經濟崩潰，購買力弱，影響所及，於商則市肆零落。於工則積貨不銷。而致舉國艱困，無以自解。是吾國經濟衰落原因，雖非一端，而精細原棉之無出產，亦與有直接間接影響焉。故爲農村經濟計復興，爲紡織廠原棉計供給，須循人文進化之迹，爲原棉品質之推準，而自供其需求，質言之，卽力謀細長强靭潔白原棉之產生。織維細長，則可以之紡高支紗線。强靭則所成紗支雖高，仍有較高强力。潔白則成品疵。胥焉成精細紗線之要件。此就人文進化言，今後所需原棉之品質也。</p>
<p>（二）今後產業合理化所需之棉質產業合理化原則，在以最少機械勞力，發揮最大生產能率，蓋機械减少，則可减少經始之固定資本，節縮經常之動力勞力與物料消費，勞力减少，則可减少勞工僱傭之代價。生產増加，則消費之所需以除數量加大，而减其平均所佔之數。層層相因，自足致成品價格於低廉。現代紡織機械，亦準是製成。但能成其合理化效能者，棉爲唯一因子。濟棉部之單程裝置也。租紡部之「立古　」「新勃勒克司」也，精紡部之大牽伸也，胥以减少機械，而求生產能發揮至於極度也。然必採用比較清潔之長細强靭原棉，而其效始著。若原棉不潔，則於清棉梳棉部不能將細微雜物去除凈盡，而紗有瑕疵。粗紡精紡部抽長動作，難期完善。工作因難，產額减少，回花則且加多。又粗紡精紡機之用量筒管，搖紗機改用多錠，織布機改用自動裝置，所以延長落紗換管與减免換梭時間，而以最少勞力，發揮最高能率也。但不採用在長細</p>
<p>强靭之棉，則無以致其效，且接頭頻繁，停機時多，工作困難，旣增勞工，每不耐其煩勞，而致精神頽廢，此種現象，於自動織機爲尤甚。蓋能成其自動效能，不假手勞工換梭，必以經紗不易斷頭爲要件。而經紗之能不斷頭，則因應於用棉之有最細强靭織維。總合言之，紡織工程之能產業合理化，係於原棉有潔白長細强靭織維。此就產業合理化，言今後所需原棉之品質也。</p>
<p>次言吾國今後所需之棉量。先依海關册，</p>
<p>將民元後棉貨棉紗棉花之輸入値，及棉在之輸入量，分列於後，以見吾國近二十餘年棉類出產與輸入之消長。</p>

<p>吾國現有紡錠四百五十餘萬枚。屬於國人自辯者，二百五十餘萬枚。　於外商經營者！二百餘萬枚。全年消費棉量八百九十餘萬担，國内產棉八百餘萬担，除衣絮被絮及小部份手織工業用之棉外，實佔能供給紡廠者，僅有五百餘萬担。故尙有三百數十萬担之差額取給於外棉。但現有紡錠，去花能自給程度遠甚。卽現產棉量，去棉能自給程度尤遠。棉產自須爲積極之增進，請依國内紡織工業進展狀况！分二期推進。</p>
<p>第一期能供現有紡錠消費之需，除原有產量外，須極力增植細長强靭潔白之棉。長四分之三吋至一吋者一百三十萬担。又十六分之一吋至十六分之三吋者三百四十萬担。又一又四分之一吋至一又二分之一吋者六十萬担。須共增五百三十萬担。</p>
<p>第二期依拙作推進棉業三三計盡，增加紡錠四百零五萬枚，織機九萬七千三百台。紡機所成之紗，能供織機製織之需。機機所成之布，能供全國衣被之需。而棉產之須增加，以適應此紡機所消費者；長四分之三吋至一吋者須一千零十萬担。一又十六分之一吋至一又十六分之三吋者四百七十萬担。一又四分之三吋至一又二分之一吋以上者須一百萬担。總計一千五百十入萬担。</p>
<p>上僅就今後所需增加之棉量而言。至如何增　棉田！如何以料學方法改進棉種，如何指導棉農改良種棉則又農之事也。當此農村亟待興復，原棉之質與量，亟待改進時期，願負有改進棉產之　者，知其所負使命之重大各本所　　，致之於行，惠我農村。供我紡織界所需原棉。不長此仰賴外棉輸入自斷國脈。我紡織界　須予以棉業經濟的合作，凡良質原棉來售於廠，須給以合理的價値，引起棉農改進棉質興趣。如是生產者與消費者打成一片，共致力於　棉之質與量的增進，自不難收最後之功。是尤下走所　　切望者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c212">世界經濟恐慌現階段中最嚴重的貨幣問題黃章 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>現階段的世界經濟恐慌，是資本主義目前最嚴重的病症。醫生們又已經大聚會了一次，這襄有各國的政治家，理論家，實行家，實業家，財政專家以及當商大賈，眞是濟濟一堂，漪歟盛哉！這是人人所知道的，從六月十二日開幕，剛纔休會的倫敦世界經濟會議。這些醫生們，各懷各的良方，在大會中各逞雄辯，結果終竟没有討論出一個共同一致的良方來；這個奄待斃的病人丨資本主義，仍舊在床上輾轉呻吟着，這是多麽令人慘痛的一回事啊！這到底是什麽一個難醫的病症呢？讓我們詳細的來分析罷。</p>
<h3 id="c213">一·堅硬的關稅壁壘 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>目前的情况，雖不能說是絕了望，確然也夠嚴重的了。這個經濟病，不是别的，就是我們醫家「大動脈　硬症」Arterioscleros在各主要的資本主義的國度襄，生產的數字，比較一九二九年要减少了五分之二。自從去年秋季起，生產數字的减少却停止了，但國際貿易的數字又呈現下落的趨勢。一九三三年頭三個月的世界貿易的總數，只及一九二九年同時期的總數百分之三十五，比較一九三二年的同時期還要减少。商品的流通，一天一天的艱難，世界貿易的大小動派一天一天的停滯起來，血管中不夠流通這營養的經濟血輪丨商品，這是千眞萬確的事實。</p>
<p>近代資本主義的所謂「大動脈僵硬症，」以經濟上的衛語說來，便是「保護主義的狂熱」LaFolieprorectioninisre。各國邊彊的鎖閉，至一九三三年更嚴重起來了。依據國際聯盟經濟研究組最近研究的結果，工業日報曾經列舉了一些主要的嚴重事情如下：</p>
<p>「我們從關稅的觀點上去研究各國商業政策的演進，可以說，自從一九三三年的一月起，各國稅則的修改是不勝枚舉的；這些修改，與其說是緩和目前的病症，毋寗說是加重目前的病症。</p>
<p>瑞典，挪威，捷克，波蘭，瑞士，匈牙利，英國等等，通統都改換了她們的關稅稅則。德國　於畜牲及鮮肉類的加稅，已無形中破壞了一九二七年與法國所訂定的商業條約所規定的某些稅則，而法國同樣的，爲恢復她與德國商業的平衡起見，也限制了好些德國商品的輸入。</p>
<p>我們還可以舉出奥大利的例子‘她們關稅上應收入的英國金幣，改徵先令，這樣一轉換之間，她無形中倒增加了百分之二十五的稅率。</p>
<p>法國對於中國，日本，錫蘭，新西蘭，南非洲及蘇聯等處的入口所徵的，所謂「匯兌賠償一的附加稅，也已增加了。　　基於以上這種種關稅的變化，於是各國的商業情况亦不能不有新的整理。到處都限制國外的輸入，而且一天天的加强其限制的方法。因爲各國另外設法發展各種非常態的商業，法國又不能不限制新的商品之輸入，瑞士，奥大利，匈牙利也是一樣。一切國家底經濟不安定的局勢，都很自然地從她們的條約政策上反映出來。」</p>
<p>自從去年秋季以來，生產界下落的現象已經停止了，這個事實，似足指示目前的經濟情况，比一年以前要進步些了。今日之所以令人呻吟痛苦者，則是在擴張生產之後，又遇到各國嚴重的關稅戰爭，僵硬了國際商業的動脈，使這巨量的商品無汉流通於國際市塲啊。倘若要使生產界活動，惟一切方法，必須各國的關稅休戰！然而，在各國都要保持商業平衡的時期，關稅休戰是可能的麽！</p>
<p>自從英國華爾街上的炸彈爆發以後，三年半以來的世界經濟情况可以槪括說明之如後：　　從生產的計劃　來，過剩的恐慌正在繼續消減之中，但停滯的病症却代之而起了。在各工業部門的大部中，已經没有生產過剩的現象，供給已經不超過需要了，而且供給已大大的减少，需要反而增加了。那引起恐慌的生產與　買力的不平衡，業已消減。自然，在資本主義的機械化的社會中，生產事業不退則進，不進則退的。旣然需要已經比較地增加，生產與購買力的不平衡已經消滅，則各種生產的數目，便又增加了。可是，不幸得很，在生產的計劃剛有發展之可能時，而流通的計劃方面又發生了嚴重的障　：那堅而且高的關稅壁壘啊，各種輸入商品的限制啊，各種輸入商品的禁止入境啊，竟似水泄不通的阻礙了國際貿易。這便是世界經濟恐慌現階段中一個很顯明的病症　　二·貨幣的紛亂</p>
<p>國際貿易其所以如此的停滯，本來有兩種的原因。首先，因爲有些國家資本主義的國家，眼見着本國的商品在外國市塲銷售的數目大大的减少，便不能不將本國的市塲視爲禁　，以拒絕外國商品的輸入。數年來的經濟恐慌，把這個趨勢越逼越到極點了。其次，數年來的恐慌，使各國的財政預算和銀行計劃，處於非常搖動不定的波濤中，以致貨幣的穩定感到莫大的威脅。因爲貨幣價格的搖動，不但各國已有的限制辦法更加嚴重，而且還從新一批一批地頒佈新的限制法。關於這些限制的辦法，計有兩種的方式··直接的因爲有些國家，她自已的貨幣狀况已處於危險之中，她必須保持最低限度的金貨做准備金，禁止金貨的輸出，這樣一來，便無形中喪失了向國外購買貨物的能力；間接的說來，有些國家的貨幣本是穩定的，但爲抵制貨幣跌價國家的貨幣屯併政策起見，不能不採用保護的方法。</p>
<p>許多的國家要維持金本位，有些的國家要放棄金本位，但在許多情形中，竟發生同一不幸的結果。</p>
<p>英國與美國！她們的保護國與殖民地那是不消說得！自從放棄金本位以後，使世界市塲的紛亂更加嚴重了，她們一方面禁止金貨的自由流通，另一面又引起各國對於金貨的保護政策與對策。</p>
<p>爲的維持貨幣的穩定起見，爲的保持金貨准備庫的完全起見，德國及大部分中歐與東歐的國家又不能不頒佈許多的規條，以阻止外國商品的輸入，自然的，那些因此受損害的國家，也要設法報復了。</p>
<p>所以，我們可以說，在經濟恐慌的現階叚中，貨幣問題是非常的嚴重。國際貿易的市場旣是如此的衰落，而各國越是用關稅的限制法以互相束縛着。這是很明顯的，我們不能說，貨幣問題得着相當的解决之後，便可以將保護主義的狂潮遏住，便可以把中國長城似的一切關稅壁壘打破啊！這個保護主義，除了貨幣的不穩定以外，還有其他的原因··那就是商品出路的狹窄與蜀占啊（例如加德爾，新狄嘉等等。這比較貨幣的不穩定，未見得不是一般的重要！可是商品出路的狹窄與獨占，那是資本主義必然的趨勢，誰來注意這個艱難而生硬的問題呢。</p>
<p>這就是倫敦的世界經濟會議爲什麽特别討論貨幣問題的原因；法美之所以對立，會議之所以果次中止，部是由於這個貨幣問題。</p>
<h3 id="c214">三·解决貨幣問題的理想與實在性 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>我們知道，目前世界上有一個最重大的問題，什麽軍縮會議，洛桑會議以及倫敦的經濟會議，都是從這個問題襄發生的；這便是久懸未决的戰債問題。因爲美國反對在倫敦經濟會議中討論這個問題，所以倫敦會議的預備委員會，並没有把牠列入議事日程之内。雖然麥克唐納爾在大會中盡力提議討論這個問題，可是因爲美國代表郝爾以不出席爲消極的抵制，終没得着什麽結果。甚於戰債問題的未曾解决，各債務國不能不支付現金與美國，以致她們的準備金一天天的少，因之貨幣價格便發生搖動了。不解决根本的戰債問題，而徒從事於枝節的貨幣價格及開放匯兌等等的問題，那當然是很難發生效果的。倫敦會議之不能有什麽成績，固早已在意料中了。</p>
<p>我阀們單知道貨幣問題的重要，是不夠的；卽我們單單贊同有設法解决這貨幣問題的必要，也還是不夠的。我們要知道：第一，爲什麽並且在何種意義之下，這個貨幣問題是經濟恐慌現階叚中最重要的問題？第二，要怎樣總可以解决這個問題？第二，倘若獲得一個妥善的解决辦法之後，我們用什麽方法去使有關係的各國實行呢？</p>
<p>關於第一個問題，當然是有許多不同的意見。有些的經濟學家，說世界的經濟恐慌的原因，貨幣的不安定，也是其中之一。他們想像着，因爲物價低落了，所以發生恐慌，像這樣一俐伶」的觀察，正無異於說，因爲氣壓表上正指示落雨的氣候，所以天氣就壞了！一般俗流經濟學家說，要想解除恐慌，只有提高物價，那不是說，要想使天氣晴好，趕快去把氣壓喪上的睛雨對　　過來麽！像這樣的理論，眞是咄咄怪事！</p>
<p>另外有）部分的經濟學家，比較的注意事實。他們以爲貨幣問題對於經濟恐慌是没有責任的，换言之，恐慌並非由於貨幣價格的低落。貨幣問題解决之後，並不能保障將來的繁榮。但他們以爲，各國　分的保護主義的辦法。也應該設法緩和些，因爲緩和保護的辦法，　金便可以自由流通，工商業亦可慢慢地恢復。　却有相當的理由。</p>
<p>貨幣問題眞是一切恐慌的根源麽？貨幣變動與物價變動眞是目前經濟災禍的原因麽？或者說，貨幣問題雖無關於復興世界的緊業，但在恐慌的現階段中，仍不失其爲主要的問題麽？這一切的問題，　是見仁見智，各有不同的觀念。例如美國的代表說，貨幣問題是不關緊要的，美國金元的跌價，是指高物價，恢復人民購買力，復興工商業的緊急辦法，這與各國都有利益的；而法國却完全處於相反的地位，她認爲非穩定貨幣價格，一切的國際合作便無從着手。這原是站在本國利益的立塲說話，固無足怪。那麽，各國的經濟學者都站在本國利益的立場說話，又那能獲得一數的觀念呢！</p>
<p>基於對第一個問題的觀念之不同，因之對於第二個問題，要怎樣纔可以解决這個貨幣問題，當然也就各異其說了。從根本上說來，美國若不願解决戰債問題，則一切解决貨幣問題的方案，都仍舊還是問題。卽舍掉戰債問題的關係不談，我們用什麽方法去使各國的貨幣獲得相當一致的價格呢？用那種的匯兌率去穩定各國的匯兌呢？難道能夠使產金，存金，用金及產銀，存銀，用銀的利益不同的各國，共同建設一個國際的貨幣本位麽？這一切的矛盾，在自私自利的資本主義世界，本來就不能解决的。倫敦會議之不能得着一致的結論，固絲毫無足爲怪的事。</p>
<p>關於第三個問題，倘若我獲得一個安善的解决辦法之後，我們用什麽方法去使有關係的各國實行？這是很顯而易見的，國際的會議，在歷史上已數見不鮮，會議的結果，總有一些堂皇的議决案出現，但一經散會之後，便仍兩詐我噳，視議决案爲具文，幾曾見過遵守信約的事實來！</p>
<p>因此，貨幣問題，在恐慌的現階段中，雖是一個最嚴重的問題，却不是一個根本的問題。卽令是倫敦會議繼續開會，得着什麽暫時穩定貨幣的辦法，終不能解决世界的經濟恐慌。因爲在各國自私自利的經濟制度没有辦法可以消，各國經濟上彼此的矛盾，是没有辦法可以消除的；更何况歐戰以後的戰債問題，還在繼續不已的加重歐美兩洲的對立性呢！（一九三三，七，二七，稿。）</p>

<p>在這一切都矛盾畸形的　　裏，不會不反映出　　積的矛盾。所以　「發財　」，「跑馬券」，「獎券」等頭的　　也　該是矛盾的社會裏底產物品了你看。許多　在越是矛盾裏抓越是　；明明知道買一切的獎券的希望像在海底撈針一般的幻滅，但是一班的人們，當然窮傢伙佔絕對的多數，誰</p>
<p>都不願放棄了這一種渺然的希望。當我每一次看到像人們這樣起勁的時候，簡直不想信社會是没落了的。推其所以如此矛盾的原因，答案恐怕就是：「没有一種希望能再比這種樣子的幻滅所希望好些在這現實的社會裏」。</p>
<p>你將以爲這種的希望就是極端個人主義的表示嗎？對的，他們化了心血的錢甚至於從饑餓裏抽由來的幾個錢來作這孤注一擲是毫無問題的爲了他們有一個極大的發財慾望存在。但是在另外一方面同樣的有一點可以値得我們注意的，就是他們要爲了報仇現實待他們的不滿，而把這報仇的企圖也放在這幻滅的希望上。這就是促成他們趨入勾滅希望裏的副條件吧？</p>
<p>還不是嗎，我有好幾個朋友買了這次的「乂乂獎劵。他們在没有開獎以前已經在預備分派那個驚人數目的乂十萬元了。有他要弄幾個絕色的佳麗女人來玩玩，因爲他的妻了跟了某公子逃了，當他在窮得不堪的時候，有的要買幾輛汽車到街上橫衝直撞的示威，爲的是他无天天在馬路上受盡了烏氣汽車的逼人。總之他們在憎恨現實，想在幻滅的希望裏種下了一些復仇心，其中很少的人抱着了安份守已的成家立業的思想。丨只有可惜朋友中間一個也没有中了獎。像他們這種消極的表示也着實幼稚得可笑。</p>
<p>當然，除了一個獨得獎欵的幸運兒外，悵惘和悲哀的該是千百萬。但是有人說：「我們在未開獎之前是多麽地快樂在做着又甜又密的夢啊！雖然這個夢是多少地空虚幻滅，不過在這整天疲乏機械的心靈上有了這種的空虚夢已是無上的光榮巡慰了」。像這種阿日的思想我們扪心自問是否對的？自然，這種的「暫時美夢」希望也不是一個也路啊！因爲他們用血和汗換來的錢就難道說只値這一點代價嗎？不，决不，那麽我們的出路听？</p>
<p>好好的做人家，巴巴結結的積蓄幾個錢是一條最好的出路吧？但是簡單地說：在現社會下想積幾個錢該是夢想，你能把一天三餐的生活問題解决後已經是幸運兒了。那麽我們的出路呢？</p>
<p>上面的二條路已經走不通了，那麽我們應該再找第三條啊！就假定以上二條路是「做夢路」，那麽現在要走的一定是「清醒中」。「清醒路」决不是能躺在床上的，它是應該清醒起身去找出路的。但是畢竟也是件困難的事啊！就是尖刺擺在你的床前使你起不得身，再睡下起吧，滿是泥潭了，你將再起來可難了。那麽我們的出路呢？</p>
<p>但是人類總是向生存路跑的！</p>

<p>— 巴珨</p>
<p>在報紙的豆腐干廣告裏，時常有招請敎員的啓事，尤其在暑期的夏天更多，因爲暑期是各校更迭敎員的時機，　　失業人的心理，是苦悶的，他感覺到失業的悲哀痛苦，於是便拚命地找事情做，因此這分類廣告的徵求類，便成了失業者每天所必讀的恩物、吾友K君當然地也不能例外。</p>
<p>是一個夏天的晚上，我正在庭中納凉，驟然聽見一陣很急的脚步聲，直向我家走來，我急視之，原來是K君，他見了我，說道：「現在有一個做敎員的」</p>
<p>機會，這機會是我在報上找到的，你看丨」我接過報來一看，上面有這樣一段話：</p>
<p>敝校現擬聘請敎員六人·資格須師範畢業，待遇每月卅元·供膳宿·願就者請携帶證書并報名費二元乂乂路乂乂里乂乂號接洽報名，聽候面試，合則聘請。校啓</p>
<p>我看了以後，即對K君說道：「這雖然是一個機會，不過你得謹愼些，究竟靠得住否？不要是滑頭吧？黑幕呢？</p>
<p>K聽了我的話說道：「管他滑頭不滑頭，黑幕不黑幕，我失業已久，難道犠性這機會不幹嗎？横竪報名祗費二元，如屬黑幕，那我只好自認晦氣，譬如生一場病吧？</p>
<p>K說完以後，略生而去，過了一星K又來了，看他形色很是苦悶，不若前者之活潑矣，當我尙未開口問他的時候，他先說道：「老友，我上當啦，那次的招請敎員，的確是黑幕呢？滑呀！這一次我去報名的時候，一位西裝青年在這子問裏辦公，此時報名者已有一百多人，我亦依法報名，經二小時後，而西裝者問我履歷籍貫等，最後說，三百後再行通知，我便繳了二大元而回。</p>
<p>我回家以後，整天的望着通知不料三日過後，通知毫無，我不禁大疑，乃急急地赴報名處一探究竟，則已人物兩空，據鄰居云·已於前日搬場矣，老友，此非黑幕乎？滑頭乎？余眞上當不淺也。</p>
<p>我聽了他的話不禁愣然，默思在此黑漆一團烏迷瘴氣之社會青年涉世，誠大難事前途設有無數，陷阱，專等待年青人去踏入，是誠危險之至矣！K君之受　，尚其小焉者也·然敎育之破產，亦於此可見矣。鳴呼，噫，嘻。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Feng Yuxiang's Telegram <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>All military and political affairs of Chahar Province are handed over to Song to be responsible for handling. Xiong Bin returns to Beiping to report on the negotiations in Shacheng. Song Zheyuan's guards take over Xuanhua, and Feng Zhi'an's troops are transferred to Zhangjiakou to take over defense.</p>
<h3 id="e2">General Feng Will Go to Zhangbei or Wanquan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang issued a telegram from Zhangjiakou this afternoon, saying: "My sincere intentions of seeking peace and loving the country have been repeatedly stated in two telegrams to Mr. and Mrs. Shi Ge. I believe the people of the country can understand my position. Former Chairman of Chahar Province, Song Zheyuan, arrived in Chahar yesterday. From today onwards, all military and political affairs of Chahar Province will be handed over to Chairman Song to be responsible for handling. Special telegram to inform." (Feng Yuxiang, imprinted) (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Bin took the PingSui Railway's second section of Anbu's second regiment at 4:00 PM today, heading to Zhangjiakou tonight to take over the defense. The railway bureau has prepared a car for him to return to Beiping to report to He Yingqin on the negotiations in Shacheng. According to him, after arriving in Shacheng yesterday, a telegram was sent to Zhangjiakou to report. Feng sent Sun Liangcheng, Tong Linge, and Qiu Shanning by special car to Xiahuayuan. Song and others went by special car to Shacheng to consult at Pang's headquarters. In addition to Song, Tong, Sun, and Qiu, Xu Tingyao, Pang Bingxun, and Feng Qinzai also participated in the consultations. A general agreement was reached before they dispersed. Feng's original telegram has been drafted, stating that Song was ordered to return to Chahar, and someone is responsible for Chahar's administration. Song is responsible for all Chahar's post-war affairs. From now on, he will not be responsible for any documents or telegrams issued under the name of Yuxiang. After the telegram was drafted, Tong and the other two returned to Zhangjiakou by special car this morning and handed it over to Feng for review. After some revisions, it was issued by Zhang at 1:00 PM this afternoon. Song brought more than 200 guards to take over Xuanhua today. Song wired for two trains for Feng Zhi'an to transport. Feng decided to leave Zhangjiakou. Song hoped that Feng would come south, but it is uncertain whether Feng will come south or go north, because Feng is a member of the Central Committee and the National Government, and his movements cannot be restricted. During the transition period of Chahar's security, Tong is maintaining order in Zhangjiakou. The miscellaneous troops recruited by Feng are being transferred away from the railway line and Zhangjiakou, and Song is asked to be responsible for recruiting them. After this issue is resolved, some of the troops filling the defense in Chahar will be transferred back. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng left Zhangjiakou and went to live in a certain place in Zhangbei County or moved to a mountain village northwest of Wanquan County to engage in rural reading and painting. Feng has stated that he will not interfere in Chahar's military and political affairs and does not want to accept any more titles. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops in Chengde are concentrating in the Tuan Field area, preparing to attack Dolun again. The situation in Dolun has been extremely serious in recent days. Rumors of its fall on the 4th have not been confirmed. Ji Hongchang and Ling Yun's troops are currently stationed in Dolun. Zhang is concurrently the commander of Dolun's garrison. Song's troops have begun to advance into Chahar. Seven trains left tonight. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Bin said that the rumors of the fall of Dolun are inaccurate. Ji Hongchang and Ling Yun are still stationed there. If the puppet troops invade, they will be attacked. After Xiong reported the consultation situation to He, He will send telegrams to Nanjing and Jiangxi tonight. It is said that when Feng and Song met, they handed over power in person, and then Feng led the guards to Zhangbei to live. The issue of titles is not a problem. Regarding the situation in Dolun, the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that they are on alert against the Anti-Japanese Allied Army in Chahar. Now that Feng's telegram has arrived in Beiping, it will be forwarded to the Japanese side. Shibata, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, will immediately telegraph the details to his country. The Japanese army's alert to Chahar may also be stopped. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song finishes taking over the defense of Xuanhua, he will move into Xuanhua. After the handover of Xuanhua is completed, he will move again, or he may meet with Feng once. Pang Bingxun is the commander of bandit suppression in Chahar Province. Pang's troops will stay in Chahar to eliminate bandits. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, Song Zheyuan sent personnel to post notices along the PingSui Railway, saying that he was returning to Chahar to resume his post on orders. Last night, he also telegraphed his troops stationed in Pingdong to prepare to mobilize back to Chahar. The PingSui Railway Bureau dispatched two trains to Shuangqiao Station on the PingTong Railway last night and this morning for standby. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan and Jiang Bocheng sent a telegram to Beiping this morning to report to He on the progress, saying that peace is hopeful. It is rumored that Feng can end the military affairs, hand over power, and temporarily reside in Zhangbei. Before Song takes office, Tong Linge will temporarily maintain order in Zhangjiakou. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that Feng's willingness to resolve peacefully is due to three reasons: 1. Chahar Province's finances are exhausted. After the PingSui Railway was interrupted, all industries in Zhangjiakou were stagnated, and income became even smaller, making it impossible to support the 100,000 miscellaneous troops. 2. There were differences of opinion within the Allied Army. Conflicts often arose between the new and the old. After Deng Wen was assassinated, internal suspicion increased. 3. The Japanese puppet army launched a large-scale attack on Dolun and Guyuan, and the momentum was fierce. Feng's army was originally a ragtag bunch and mostly based in the Zhangjiakou area, making it difficult to defend. Due to the above three reasons in Dolun and Guyuan, Feng could not support and cope with this situation. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan and Jiang Bocheng arrived in Shacheng the day before yesterday afternoon and immediately met with Feng Yuxiang's representatives. According to a long-distance phone call obtained by He Yingqin, the meeting was progressing smoothly. It is said that Feng now wishes to return Chahar Province to the central government, and he himself will go to Zhangbei, forty miles northeast of Zhangjiakou, expressing his sincerity of "retiring from public life." Based on the current progress of the meeting, Song Zheyuan may return to Zhangjiakou within days. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chahar affair is now expected to be resolved peacefully. This afternoon, Feng Yuxiang sent a short telegram from Zhangjiakou, roughly saying that since Song Zheyuan has returned to Chahar yesterday, from today onwards, all military and civil affairs of Chahar Province will be handed over to Song for takeover. Xiong Bin, who accompanied Song to Shacheng yesterday, returned to Beiping this afternoon, saying that he had negotiated with Feng's representatives in Shacheng. Song Zheyuan will now go directly to Zhangjiakou to take up the post of chairman. Before taking office, Tong Linge will temporarily act as chairman according to the method proposed by He Yingqin.

<h3 id="e3">Jiangxi Headquarters Promulgates Methods for Appeasing Surrendered Bandits <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The Headquarters promulgated temporary methods for appeasing surrendered bandits, totaling sixteen articles. Article 10 states: "A bandit who surrenders with a complete rifle will be rewarded with 20 yuan; a bandit who surrenders with a complete machine gun will be rewarded with 200 yuan; a bandit who surrenders with a complete cannon will be rewarded with 500 yuan. A surrendered bandit who kills his fake regimental commander and has a head to prove it is true will be rewarded with 200 yuan, a fake division commander 500 yuan, a fake army commander 1,000 yuan, a fake army corps commander 5,000 yuan, and Zhu and Mao each 20,000 yuan. The reward for killing political commissars of all levels will be halved, and the reward for capturing them alive will be the same. The rewards will be issued in advance by the appeasement agency, and the Headquarters will be notified to claim the firearms, which should be submitted together with the report. The remaining articles are omitted." (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The confession of surrendered bandits is published: 1. In addition to various harsh taxes such as food collection to aid the war and mutual land assistance in the bandit areas, public bonds are also levied. 2. The bandit army's firearms and ammunition have no source of replenishment except for looting. 3. The bandit army has suffered a large number of deaths. In addition to recruiting hooligans and deserters, they are forcibly conscripting young men, emptying the ranks. 4. The bandit training first anesthetizes their minds so that they can give up their lives, then specializes in practicing grabbing mountain tops and aiming movements quickly. Other training methods are not emphasized. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The first class of the Lushan Military Officer Training Corps held a graduation ceremony on the 4th. Chiang instructed them to work hard to suppress bandits and serve the country loyally. The trainees will return to their original positions from the 5th. The second class will begin soon.

<p>There are Still Twists and Turns in the Pingyu Railway Through Traffic</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Insists on Direct Access to Shenyang</p>
<p>Our Side Believes it is Difficult to Implement</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Yu Pass Transportation Conference Was Not Held <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army on the Beining Line is expected to complete its withdrawal by the 7th. The Japanese side intends to fund the transportation of all camps and cumbersome items from Beining by rail to Lezhou, and then from Lezhou to the Rehe area. The Pingyu Railway through traffic is expected to be implemented on the 8th after the Japanese army has completely withdrawn. However, the Japanese side insists on direct access to Shenyang, and the puppet Fengshan Railway vehicles must also have direct access to Beiping. Our side believes that this point is difficult to agree to because the subject of negotiation is the Japanese side and has nothing to do with the puppet state. It needs to be carefully considered before a decision can be made on the through traffic method. The rumor that a transportation conference will be held in Yu Pass has not been held because the opinions of both sides are not yet consistent. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The transportation conference held between China and Japan in Shanhaiguan has not made any significant progress. The only hope of the Chinese representative is to restore traffic between Beiping and Yu Pass as soon as possible. However, the Japanese representative insisted that traffic between Beining must be restored. The Chinese side objected to this, believing that this would be tantamount to allowing vehicles from "Manchukuo" to travel in Beiping, because China cannot allow vehicles from countries it does not recognize to enter Chinese territory. The Chinese side has now suggested that both sides' traffic be separated by Yu Pass, and all goods and passengers change trains at Changcheng Station. The meeting will continue to discuss today.

<p>(Shantou) Ye Jianying, the bandit chief on Lingshan, has only 3,000 soldiers. The Meixian Air Force has been flying to Huichang and Ruijin for reconnaissance for days. Bandit suppression propaganda teams followed the army into Jiangxi. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to front-line news, the government army is winning in bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province. The 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, commanded by Qu Shounian, fought fiercely with the main force of the bandits yesterday. The bandits were hit hard and retreated, abandoning many corpses. It is said that the bandits in southern Jiangxi have a shortage of food and have retreated into Huichang and Ruijin. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed the Beiping office, urging the issuance of two months' military pay, totaling 260,000 yuan, to facilitate the departure. Sun has appointed five people from the adjutant, staff, and military station offices, as well as one staff officer from each brigade, to inspect the route in the Wuyuan and Ningxia areas. They have already departed. His representative in Beiping, Hu Jiesan, will go to Hankou tonight to visit Chiang in Lushan, report on the situation of Sun's troops, and urge the collection of two months' military pay and discuss all matters related to the departure. He will stay in Lushan for about a week before returning to Beiping. Regarding the rumor that Sun's troops mutinied in Salar on the 8th, the army office stated that it has not received any reports.

The counties of Fan, Pu, Shou, and Gu in this province, which are located between the official embankment and the folk embankment, have been affected by the disaster. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) He Yaozu and other Hunan members of the Central Committee submitted a report to the Central Political Council, stating that after He Jian, the chairman of Hunan Province, issued 5 million yuan of national salvation public bonds a month ago, he recently discussed with Zhang Gongquan, the president of the Bank of China, to issue 10 million yuan of construction public bonds and established a small loan of 500,000 yuan, nominally for the construction of a light railway from Taohuaping to Hongjiang. However, no one dares to guarantee whether it will not be used for other purposes. If the central government completely ignores the suffering of the people and the support of the people, and caters to the requests of military and political leaders, it is feared that it will not be a blessing for the future of the region. Moreover, within a year and within a province, various names are used, without seeking practical results. Suddenly, 5 million yuan of public bonds are issued, and suddenly 10 million yuan of public bonds are issued, all of which are approved by the central government. This happens every year and is promoted in every province, which will prolong the situation of warlords occupying their territories. The future of the party and the country cannot be imagined. The central government proclaims unification every day, but who will be responsible for destroying unification? This must be considered. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>A Notice Denying the "State of Manchuria"</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On February 24th of this year, the League of Nations Special Assembly passed a report recommending that all member states, whether in law or in fact, continue not to recognize the puppet organization of Manchuria, and established an Advisory Committee to observe the situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute thereafter, and to assist the Assembly in performing its duties under Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. On March 15th, the Advisory Committee again decided to establish two subcommittees, the second of which was specifically to study various issues arising from the non-recognition of "Manchukuo." Subsequently, at the request of the Advisory Committee, the Secretariat of the League of Nations drafted a preliminary report on the non-recognition of "Manchukuo," which was then submitted to the second subcommittee for study and revision before being submitted to the Advisory Committee. The Committee formally approved it on June 7th, and on June 12th, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations sent it in the form of a circular to the member states of the League of Nations and to the non-member states that had previously been sent the report of the General Assembly on February 24th of this year. The content of the circular consistently upheld the principle of non-recognition of the puppet organization, which fully demonstrates the presence of international justice. Our Foreign Ministry recently received the full text of the circular from the League of Nations and immediately engaged the Intelligence Department to translate it. In addition to immediately printing a white paper in both Chinese and Western languages, the translation was first published on the 6th as follows:</p>
<p>丨 Circular on Measures for Non-Recognition of "Manchukuo" Passed by the Advisory Committee of the Special Assembly of the League of Nations on June 7, 1933. Based on the resolution of the General Assembly of February 24, 1933, the General Assembly appointed an Advisory Committee to observe the situation in the Far East, to assist the General Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities under Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, and to assist the member states of the League of Nations for the same purpose, to take consistent action and attitude among the member states themselves and with non-League of Nations member states. The Advisory Committee is aware that, according to Section 3 of Part 4 of the report passed by the General Assembly on February 24th, "The member states of the League of Nations intend to avoid any action that may delay the implementation of the recommendations of the General Assembly report, and especially regarding the current organization of Manchuria, each country will continue not to recognize the organization, whether in law or in fact, each country intends to avoid taking any individual action regarding the situation in Manchuria, and intends to continue to take consistent action among the member states and related non-member states." The Advisory Committee believes that it is appropriate to study what consequences the denial of the current organization of Manchuria may have for governments, and requests member states to pay attention to the following measures, which each country should be free to implement separately. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee, in its capacity as an advisory body, is willing to be at the disposal of any member state of the League of Nations that requests it to study any issue within its scope of authority, hoping to express its views and discuss with the governments the formulation of consistent measures. The Advisory Committee has now discussed the following issues: the current government of Manchuria's participation in League of Nations conventions, postal and postage stamp issues, the issue of international non-recognition of "Manchukuo" currency, various issues arising from foreigners accepting concessions or being employed in Manchuria, passport issues, consular status issues, and the issue of applying import and export goods and certificate system according to the Geneva Opium Convention (1925) Restriction Convention (1931).</p>
<p>(1) Since the member states of the League of Nations have decided to continue not to recognize the current organization of Manchuria in law and in fact, it is clear that what they have in mind is that if "Manchukuo" expresses its desire to join a certain general international convention, each country should immediately take various measures within its power to prevent it from joining. Among these conventions, there are those that create international associations or international bureaus, and to participate in such international organizations, it is necessary to join the convention that established the organization. The Advisory Committee has studied various general international conventions, and its purpose is to determine what procedures member states of the League of Nations can take to act in accordance with the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly when "Manchukuo" expresses its willingness to join such conventions. From this standpoint, international conventions can be divided into the following types: (A) Non-public conventions, joining this type of convention requires consulting the opinions of the original signatory countries, member states of the League of Nations only need to refuse "Manchukuo" to join to comply with the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly. (B) Public conventions, this type of convention stipulates that countries can unilaterally join, but in view of the special circumstances of "Manchukuo" and the attitude taken by member states of the League of Nations towards this organization, the Committee hereby decides to recommend that if "Manchukuo" expresses its willingness to join this convention, the country that holds the joining documents should first consult the opinions of the signatory countries of the convention. Regarding one or more of these conventions, if the country that holds the joining documents consults the signatory countries of the convention, then the member states of the League of Nations that are currently signatory countries of the convention can have an opportunity to express their opposition to the joining of "Manchukuo" in accordance with the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly. The country that holds the joining documents can also, as a result of the consultation, reply to the requesting country based on the opinions of the signatory countries. In particular, among the following conventions, the governments of Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland can have the opportunity to consult the remaining signatory countries as mentioned above. Belgium: Convention signed on December 30, 1913, on the establishment of the International Bureau of Commercial Statistics, Convention signed on March 15, 1886, on the international exchange of government documents and scientific and literary publications, Convention signed on July 5, 1890, on the establishment of the International Union for the Publication of Customs Tariffs. Spain: Convention signed on December 9, 1932, in Madrid, on the establishment of the International Telecommunication Union. France: Convention on Air Navigation Rules (Article 41) signed in Paris on October 13, 1919, International Exhibition Convention signed in Paris on November 22, 1928, Agreement on the establishment of the International Office of Epizootics signed in Paris on January 25, 1924, Convention on the establishment of the International Chemistry Bureau signed on October 29, 1927, Metric Convention signed on May 20, 1875, revised in 1921, on the establishment of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, Health Convention signed in Paris on June 26, 1926. Italy: Agreement signed in Rome on December 9, 1907, on the establishment of the International Office of Public Health. Netherlands: Various conventions signed at the Fifth Hague Peace Conference in 1907, International Opium Convention signed in The Hague on January 23, 1912, International Air Hygiene Convention signed in 1933. Switzerland: Convention on Industrial Property (International Bureau for the Protection of Industrial Property, the convention was first concluded in 1883 and revised in 1925), Convention on the establishment of the International Union for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (the convention was first concluded on September 9, 1886, and revised in 1928), Universal Postal Convention (last revised in London on June 28, 1929), Geneva Convention on the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field signed in Geneva on July 27, 1929 (i.e., the Red Cross Convention), Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Convention on Non-War (i.e., the Paris Convention). The position of the United States government can be regarded as the same as the position of member states of the League of Nations that hold various conventions. (C) Conventions concluded under the guidance of the League of Nations, therefore, for those that other countries can join, most of them must be decided by the League of Nations Administrative Council, so the countries that participated earlier do not need to take other actions. Regarding this type of convention that other countries can join, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations cannot accept the joining of "Manchukuo." As for the Convention on the Supervision of the Sale of Arms and Ammunition and the Convention on the Prohibition of Poison Gas, the French government has been asked to consult the opinions of the participating countries when necessary. Other agreements, such as the Hague Convention for the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes and the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice, all contain clauses for joining that naturally exclude "Manchukuo." This is the same as the permission to join various conventions, which must be decided by the League of Nations Administrative Council, and the countries that participated earlier do not need to take any other actions. In addition, the Advisory Committee has also reviewed the organizational laws of several international committees and associations that are not established in accordance with international conventions, believing that since these international committees and associations are not established in accordance with international conventions, the fact that any public organization is allowed to join or send personnel to participate does not mean that the public organization has obtained legal recognition. Even if there are representatives of administrative agencies or private groups in these international committees and associations, the fact that a public organization is allowed to join or send personnel to participate should not be regarded as obtaining de facto recognition. However, even in the latter case, member states of the League of Nations participating in these international committees or associations should still try their best to prevent the participation of representatives of "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>(2) Regarding postal matters, the Chinese government announced on July 24, 1932, that in accordance with Article 27 of the Universal Postal Convention, it had requested the Universal Postal Union to notify its member states as follows: (1) All Manchurian postal services are temporarily suspended (2) All mail sent to Europe and the United States will be delivered to the Chinese government via the Suez Canal and the Pacific Ocean. Please take the same measures for mail sent to China by the post offices of all member states. (3) Postage stamps issued by the puppet government are invalid. Any mail or packages affixed with these postage stamps will be regarded as underpaid. In addition to this official document of the Chinese government, the Advisory Committee believes that member states of the League of Nations should only pay attention to two matters when the issue of "Manchukuo" joining the Universal Postal Convention arises. What are these two matters? That is, "Manchukuo" is not a member of the Universal Postal Union, and the Chinese government has made the above recommendations.</p>
<p>(3) After considering the currency issue, the Advisory Committee believes that a country's domestic currency is produced by the country's domestic laws, and its actual use is the same as any valuable item in international trade. The Committee believes that it is not appropriate to propose that governments should ban the transaction of "Manchukuo" currency through legislation. However, it is eager to urge countries with formal foreign exchange markets to pay attention and take useful measures to avoid carrying the official exchange rate of "Manchukuo" currency.</p>
<p>(4) The report passed by the League of Nations General Assembly in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant does not prohibit nationals of member states of the League of Nations from entering into contractual relations with anyone in Manchuria or accepting concessions or appointments from the authorities there. However, whether member states should draw the attention of their nationals to the special dangers associated with accepting such concessions or appointments is a matter for the member states to decide. In view of the status created by the General Assembly report and the attitude of the Chinese authorities towards the validity of concessions or appointments obtained from the Manchurian authorities under the current circumstances, it seems that governments can emphasize the difficulties in protecting their nationals.</p>
<p>(5) The Committee believes that those who have not recognized the existing organization of Manchuria in law or in fact should not recognize the documents issued by the Manchurian authorities as passports. Therefore, they cannot allow their representatives to visa these documents. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to say that residents of the "Manchukuo" authorities who wish to travel to other countries should not obtain identity documents or travel permits from the consuls of the countries they wish to travel to. Unless the authorities of the transit country are willing to visa the documents or travel permits issued by the authorities of the country they wish to travel to, and in fact they are likely to issue them, the same procedures for obtaining identity documents or travel permits can also be applied to consuls of the transit country. Consular officials must verify the authenticity of the applicant, and it is reasonable to use documents issued by the "Manchukuo" authorities that claim to be passports or travel permits. The above considerations can be applied not only to ordinary passports, but also to diplomatic passports and diplomatic visas for diplomatic or ordinary passports.</p>
<p>(6) The Committee believes that member states of the League of Nations can, when necessary, make preparations to replace their consuls in Manchuria without violating the principles of the report adopted by the General Assembly. Sending consuls under the current circumstances does not imply recognition of "Manchukuo," because these representatives are actually set up to report to the government and protect overseas Chinese. Furthermore, in accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly, governments should remind the consuls they send to avoid any actions that could be clearly or implicitly interpreted as an expression of recognition of the authorities as the legitimate government of Manchuria, as far as possible, and especially when contacting the Manchurian authorities. When governments send consular officials to Manchuria, they can be guided by their special legal status with China, and when necessary, they can take the precedent of a certain part of China, such as Guangzhou, as a standard, because the authorities there sometimes do not recognize the power of the central government.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding Chapter 5 of the 1925 Geneva Opium Convention, the Advisory Committee recommends to member states of the League of Nations and related non-member states that unless the applicant proves in accordance with the convention that the import certificate proves that the import of the goods into "Manchukuo" is not for purposes that violate the convention and satisfies the government being requested, requests for the export of opium and other narcotics to "Manchukuo" should not be permitted. An export authorization document should be sent along with the exported goods, but the government being requested should not send a copy of the export authorization to "Manchukuo," because this action may be interpreted as de facto recognition of "Manchukuo."

<h3 id="e23">Peaceful Resolution of Chahar 梓 <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Chahar issue. Due to Song Zheyuan's trip to Shacheng, and the mediation by Li Liejun, a central committee member in Shanghai, there is a trend towards resolution. We read the frugal telegram jointly issued by Wang and Chiang after the Lushan meeting, and we deeply understand the government's determination to handle the Chahar affair peacefully in the words "There are internal problems, but we should put aside emotions and seek resolution. The idea of using force internally is not only unbearable to say, but also unbearable to hear." Although Feng Yuxiang's telegram was strongly worded, his statement that "I have no intention of fighting internally, and I also cut off the logic of harming the country in the name of patriotism" is enough to make people understand that he is not always unaware. With such intentions on both sides, coupled with Song's mediation, the internal war can be fortunately eliminated, which can be known without Feng's formal announcement.</p>
<p>"All past things are like yesterday's death." We can put aside the rights and wrongs of the past seventy days, but we cannot but offer our opinions on the Chahar situation after the cancellation of local actions and the removal of obstacles to the four principles of the frugal telegram. First, the central government should, from now on, take national action to ensure the integrity of the Chahar province. What He Yingqin, the head of the Beiping Military Branch Committee, called "local actions against foreign countries not only do not help the current situation, but also harm the country" has some truth in it, which is agreed by the people of the country. However, the preservation of the Chahar province, so that it does not become a continuation of Rehe, is a matter of course and does not allow for any disagreement. The eastern boundary of Chahar province is intertwined with Rehe, which is in enemy hands. Its southern part is, in terms of its situation, the spine of Beiping. Preserving Chahar province is not only to leave some convenience for the future recovery of lost land, but also its eastern barrier, the Inner Hinggan Mountains, to prevent the Japanese from invading the Mongol flags, and stationing heavy troops in Nankou in the south, so that the Tianjin and Beiping areas surrounding the non-militarized zone have a guarantee, which is of great significance. Feng's actions after his rise cannot but make the people of the country suspicious, but no one has criticized his recovery of Dolon. What is the reason? The overall acquisition of Chahar province is not a local issue, but an important key to the situation in North China. After the Chahar affair is resolved, what methods and strength will the government use to preserve this 25,000 square kilometers of land? This is what the people of the country are paying close attention to today. Second, after the domestic disputes are resolved, Feng should avoid overtly peculiar actions and prepare for future efforts. Sun Dianying endured the pain and went west to issue a telegram, saying "Today, I graze horses in Taolin and temporarily hide among fishermen and woodcutters. In the future, I will wave my halberd in Huanglong and make another effort on the battlefield." These are the words we would like to recite for Feng. Among He Yingqin's three measures, the second is "Song will lead the team back to Chahar, and Feng will withdraw the miscellaneous troops from Zhangxuan to the north to facilitate reorganization." If Feng can reorganize his newly recruited troops well, so that they do not harm the people and become a strong army that will be useful in the future, then the disturbance of these three months will not be completely without value. The Zhangxuan storm is about to end. The people of the country are happy to see the rapid resolution of domestic disputes and hope that both sides can work together to help the current situation after the problem is resolved. We also adhere to this purpose and contribute our opinions. It goes without saying that the resolution should be sought quickly to avoid the occurrence of complications.</p>

<p>Minister Without Portfolio Appointed to Urge Suzuki and Wakatsuki to Join the Cabinet Minister of Railways Mitsuchi Visits Takahashi and Expresses Approval</p>
<h3 id="e25">Takahashi Further Advocates Changing China Policy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of appointing Suzuki of the Seiyukai and Wakatsuki of the Minseito as ministers without portfolio is an important issue that will determine the future political situation and is attracting attention from all parties. What is particularly noteworthy is the state of mind of Finance Minister Takahashi, who is enthusiastically advocating it. Prime Minister Saito will also be moved by Takahashi's enthusiasm. Under these circumstances, Minister of Railways Mitsuchi visited Finance Minister Takahashi yesterday to have a long talk. Minister of Railways Mitsuchi listened to the Finance Minister's state of mind at this time and also reported on the situation within the Seiyukai. As a result of this meeting, Minister of Railways Mitsuchi seemed to have approved the Finance Minister's opinion. It is expected that the political situation will take a sharp turn for the worse from now until September. After meeting with Finance Minister Takahashi, Minister of Railways Mitsuchi told reporters that Finance Minister Takahashi, in order to restore the credibility of the party, advocated that the two party leaders should join the cabinet as ministers without portfolio as the best policy at this time. Within the Seiyukai, there are two factions, those who agree and those who disagree. Yu and Mr. Hatoyama are among those who agree. (Dentsu Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito discussed the current situation at his villa in Hayama on the 5th, saying that the government hopes that the total amount of the budget for the next year will not exceed this year's budget, and wants to reduce public debt and its interest. The issue of increasing taxes, which has now become a general issue, will not be implemented next year. The issue of ministers without portfolio has been under consideration for a long time. We want to achieve national unity not only in form, but also in spirit. Therefore, we hope that this issue will definitely be realized. This kind of problem must be implemented when the atmosphere for its realization is strong, otherwise it will fail. According to my opinion, Japan must establish a grand plan to reform the financial and educational system for a limited period of ten or fifteen years from the end of this year. The policy of a country should never be changed arbitrarily, regardless of whether the cabinet changes or not. (Nihon Rengo Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>Hayama Prime Minister Saito made a statement to reporters yesterday on the current situation, saying that although the issue of ministers without portfolio is rampant, the government has not made a positive decision to actively promote the entry of ministers without portfolio into the cabinet. It is not due to parliamentary countermeasures, but to restore financial reform and education, and must achieve the reality of national unity. Although we hope that the leaders of the Seiyukai and Minseito will join the cabinet, we are not in a hurry to force it. The new requirements for the budget for the next year are currently being checked by the Budget Bureau, but it is not as eventful as last year, so it can be decided early. The second supplementary plan for naval spending should be determined in light of the surrounding circumstances and national strength. Although the military's plan is good, it cannot ignore the current financial situation. Although it is difficult to implement tax increases from the ninth year, my opinion and the opinions of the cabinet members are mostly consistent regarding tax increases from the tenth year. However, it is doubtful how much the tax increase can fill the deficit. (Dentsu Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Railways Mitsuchi visited Finance Minister Takahashi at his villa in Hayama on the 5th and issued a statement saying that the issue of ministers without portfolio was initiated by Finance Minister Takahashi. In order to restore the party's credibility that has been lost today, Finance Minister Takahashi will have the leaders of the Seiyukai and Minseito join the cabinet as ministers without portfolio, eliminate party prejudice, and establish national policies in order to unify national opinion. Finance Minister Takahashi is also concerned about various aspects of establishing party politics. The Finance Minister advocates that the political center should be maintained by parties and maintain democratic politics. Finance Minister Takahashi is quite concerned about the China issue, and advocates that Japan should change its diplomatic policy towards China, and frankly and frankly consult with key political figures in China on the current international political situation, so that Chinese politicians can awaken, and then implement Sino-Japanese cooperation. (Nihon Rengo Telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are opinions within the Seiyukai about establishing a party coalition, but recently the government's opinion is that this period is too early. The party leaders first joining the cabinet and contributing to the country is a shortcut to restoring the party and a right path to returning to constitutional reform.

<p>Japanese Budget</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The budget for the next year has generally been submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance will convene the accounting chiefs of each province this week to listen to explanations, and it is decided to hold a budget cabinet meeting before and after the grand exercise at the end of October. The numbers of new requests submitted so far are as follows (unit: 1,000 gold):</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs 12, Ministry of Internal Affairs 185, Ministry of the Army 208, Ministry of the Navy 430, Ministry of Justice 13, Ministry of Commerce and Industry 27, Ministry of Communications 18, Ministry of Colonial Affairs 15.</p>
<p>If we add the 150 million for the Manchurian Incident, which will be decided in the future, and others, the new requests for the next year will exceed 1.2 billion. However, the Budget Bureau plans to reduce the total budget to within 2 billion as much as possible, so the new requests will ultimately reach only half. (Dentsu Telegram on the 6th)</p>

In the organization of the Ministry of the Army, it is generally 150 million yuan. The expense may be reduced by a few points compared to this year's 165 million yuan. If we add the army's total budget of 424 million yuan submitted to the Ministry of Finance, it will be a total of 574 million yuan, an increase of 127 million yuan compared to this year.

<p>Tokyo 300,000 People Mobilized for Air Defense Exercise Opens</p>
<h3 id="e28">Like London and Paris During the European War <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>)Tokyo( Japan's unprecedented air defense drill, centered on the capital and encompassing one prefecture and four counties as the stage, is fully prepared. It commenced with live ammunition bombing exercises on the coast of Chiba Prefecture on the 7th, which served as the opening salvo. From the 9th to the 11th, for a period of three days, it mobilized 300,000 people, including various units under its jurisdiction and veterans' and youth groups from the one prefecture and four counties, using "Protect Our Airspace" as its slogan and commencing action simultaneously. Dozens of aircraft participated in the drill, including fighter planes, reconnaissance planes, and light attack aircraft. The public's patriotic radio communications corps also participated. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, the Air Defense Command Headquarters at the Army Officer School issued the first report, "Enemy aircraft attacking, the capital is in imminent danger." Simultaneously, the Defense Commander ordered "Strive to defend" throughout the exercise area. As a result, the Kanto region entered a wartime state. At night, enemy air raids were simulated through electric lights, wireless telephones, sirens, and alarms. The capital was immediately placed under fire control, transforming into a dark world, resembling London and Paris during the European War. At the same time, bombing and smoke screens were demonstrated everywhere, along with various scientific combat exercises. The outcome of this drill is of great importance to Japan's national defense, and all parties are paying the utmost attention to its progress. )United Press International dispatch on the 6th(</p>
<p>The Japanese army, unable to gain international recognition for its aggression, believes that this antagonism cannot be resolved without a major war. Therefore, it daily intimidates the people with pronouncements that war is imminent, gradually transforming all organizations into wartime configurations, forcing the people to live under the threat of war. Recently, the Japanese people have indeed developed a kind of war neurosis, with a gloomy atmosphere pervading the country. The Tokyo Garrison Command decided to conduct a large-scale Kanto air defense drill for three days starting August 9th. The detailed plan is as follows:</p>

<p>The Opponent in Air Defense</p>
<p>Is the United States. It is assumed that diplomatic relations with the United States were severed on August 1st, and war was declared simultaneously. The Japanese and American navies have already opened fire at sea. An American aircraft carrier has arrived at the Ogasawara Islands, advancing straight towards Kanto Bay, ordering its air force to bomb Tokyo City. The Japanese army received a report from the navy and immediately ordered the Tokyo Garrison Command to prepare for air defense, simultaneously announcing defense orders for the one prefecture and four counties. Commander Hayashi, upon receiving the order, immediately established an Air Defense Command Headquarters at the Army Officer School, announced a wartime organization, deployed the planned air defense forces, and commenced operations. Communication units, surveillance units, anti-aircraft artillery units, illumination units, sound detection units, guard units, medical units, liaison units, and fire brigades were all mobilized simultaneously.</p>

<p>In This Exercise, the</p>
<p>Air force strengths of both sides are as follows: The US Navy dispatched fifty ship-based fighter planes and bombers from aircraft carriers, flying from the southeast sea to bomb the imperial capital and various important cities (if the weather is bad, army aircraft from Otawara will be used instead). The Japanese air defense flying squadron will respond with the latest army fighter planes, with the strength of three squadrons, dispatched from Tokorozawa and Tachikawa, ambushing at predetermined locations, awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Japan Sends People to Nanyang to Make Contact</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Among Japan's international trade conditions, trade with Nanyang is the most important. However, recently, in addition to Nanyang, especially the Dutch East Indies, implementing the Dutch government's protectionist trade policy, the Netherlands has also been incited by the United Kingdom to implement general import restrictions. The Nanyang Association believes that the situation is serious and has decided to send three special envoys to Nanyang to exchange views with local authorities and traders to discuss strategies for the development of trade with Nanyang. The special envoys will depart within a few days and will tour various parts of Nanyang for about two months, it is said. (Dentsu dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Weak in the Indian-Japanese Conference</p>
<h3 id="e33">Criticism from Relevant Parties <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The original draft of the issues that Japan should raise at the Simla Conference, prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was submitted to the joint conference of the six relevant ministries on the 2nd. Important parts of it have been opposed by the agriculture and forestry and commerce and industry authorities, and it had to be redrafted, causing the six-ministry joint conference scheduled to be held yesterday afternoon to be postponed. It is reported that the original draft of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows: 1. Ease the import of Indian and Rangoon rice; 2. Reduce the prohibitive tariffs on Indian pig iron; 3. Guarantee the import of a certain quantity of Indian cotton every year. The intention is to reduce the tariffs on Indian cotton cloth as a concession. However, the agriculture and forestry and commerce and industry authorities strongly opposed matters under their jurisdiction. In particular, regarding guaranteeing the import of Indian cotton, it would destroy the system of importing American cotton and Indian cotton depending on the price. Therefore, they requested the revision of the original draft of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, relevant authorities and private operators have considerable criticism of the weak attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Dentsu dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are strong opinions within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry that compromise should be rejected in the Anglo-Japanese and Indo-Japanese conferences, and the government does not need to implement policies such as export controls. If negotiations fail by taking a desperate stand, then Japanese goods with low prices and good quality should be used as weapons to launch a world trade war and actively start activities to obtain new markets.

<p>(Changchun) Japanese in the four eastern provinces suggested to the Japanese Kwantung Army that since the eastern provinces are already in Japanese hands, the financial system must also be common with Japan. Currently, "Manchukuo" still adopts the silver standard, which causes many inconveniences for trade with the home country. They hope to change to the gold standard as soon as possible. This proposal has not yet been realized because the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not agree. It is heard that the Kwantung Army Special Service Department, after research, in order to remedy this shortcoming, intends to set up a transitional measure, that is, to implement the following methods: 1. Bank of Korea and Bank of Japan banknotes can be freely used in various parts of Manchuria; 2. Manchukuo Central Bank banknotes and Bank of Korea and Bank of Japan banknotes are exchanged at a legal conversion ratio, eliminating the inconvenience of exchange rate fluctuations.

<h3 id="e35">Reasons Why the Japanese Military Clique Did Not Publish Mutō's Will <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(China League Tokyo dispatch on the 6th) Former Commander Mutō's will was delivered by Okamura, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to Army Minister Araki yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Araki asked General Director of Education Hayashi, Headquarters Chief Kō, and Vice Chief of Staff Ueda to the Ministry of the Army to make its content public. Because the content mentions conclusions on the Manchurian policy, it cannot be announced to the world at present. If it is announced, it will declare that Japan will implement the merger of Japan and Manchuria at a certain time. Because there are currently two factions within the puppet state, one faction advocates an imperial system and then merges with Japan, and the other advocates a republican independence. If it is announced, the puppet state will have another internal turmoil. Each faction colludes with the Japanese military cliques. The former colludes with the Araki faction, and the latter is close to the U faction. Therefore, the struggle between the two factions will inevitably cause internal strife in Japan. The reason why the will cannot be published lies in this.</p>
<p>British Naval Department's Shipbuilding Plan</p>
<p>Catching Up with the US and Japan, US International Policy Changes )London( It is recently heard that the British Naval Department is currently planning to enrich the navy by increasing the number of cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. This expenditure will be included in the budget for approximately the next year. However, it is not intended to be built before 1936, because these new ships are completely outside the limits of the London Treaty. The reason for this move by the British is caused by the shipbuilding programs of the United States and Japan. Although the ships built by the two countries are within the scope of the treaty, their urgent activities to expand their navies show that there have been changes in policies on reducing armaments. Therefore, the British are also catching up. (National News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US State Department formally denied that Japan had protested against the US shipbuilding program. At the same time, officialdom also indicated that the US government has temporarily abandoned the so-called "outward-looking" policy and will no longer initiate any international movements. However, for those initiated by other countries, if they do not have major conflicts with the current revival plan of nationalism, they are still prepared to cooperate. According to widespread rumors in London, Japan is quite anxious about the US shipbuilding policy and has protested to the United States that it does not conform to the spirit of the Washington and London treaties. Therefore, the US State Department specifically denied today that the United States does not violate the treaty, even if the new ships are built, they still do not exceed the treaty limits. At the same time, according to sources outside the State Department, the US government's strong rejection of the proposal to stabilize currency prices at the World Economic Conference is the beginning of adopting a "looking after oneself" policy. It has been over a decade since the United States actively participated in international affairs, advocating new treaties, new economic cooperation, and other cooperative actions. This rejection of stabilizing currency and the start of the naval program, declaring that the US Navy must not be inferior to other countries, can all be regarded as the beginning of its nationalist plan. However, it is also solemnly stated that the US President does not approve of opening up an isolationist policy. After taking office, he tried to continue Hoover's international policy, the so-called "Stimson Doctrine," which he also supported. However, in the near future, there may be very little advice to other countries, and even on the issue of disarmament, this policy will be followed. In Geneva in the future, there will probably only be suggestions, or there will no longer be sharp applications and requests. Although the policy previously pursued by the United States will not be abandoned, it will no longer launch new international events. (National News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>Britain and France Negotiate with Germany, Italy Acts Alone</p>
<p>Reuters Rome dispatch on the 5th. The German National Socialist Party used radio broadcasts to conduct propaganda in Austria and used airplanes to drop leaflets in Austria. France and Britain have sent documents to negotiate with the German government. Italy was initially expected to join this action, but today, according to a certain official from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italy is now being cautious and it is inconvenient to join and there is no need to join. However, according to non-official sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is very concerned about this matter and has informally reiterated his advice in Berlin in a gentle state. The wording is very euphemistic. According to news from Paris, the notes from Britain and France to Germany are very euphemistic. However, the right-wing opposition party still thinks that the methods used are too weak, while the Socialist Party believes that this matter should be transferred to the League of Nations for handling. The moderates do not want to punish Germany and also hope that the determination of British-French cooperation can make Austrian sovereignty respected.</p>

<p>Issues Emergency Application to the Entire US Industry to Set Up an Arbitration Board to Mediate Labor-Management Disputes National News Agency Hyde Park dispatch on the 5th. US President Roosevelt issued an emergency application to the national industry today, requesting to stop all means of strikes and factory closures, gather all sectors of the country, and promote the industrial recovery plan to ensure its early success. The US President issued this application after hearing the news that the coal miners, after mediation by the Miners' Union Chairman Lewis and other labor leaders, agreed to resume work and work according to the mining industry's industry rules sent to the President, and hoping that all sectors will immediately accept the advice, a arbitration board was specially established to mediate all labor-management disputes, commissioning General Electric Company Chairman Stewart, American Federation of Labor Chairman Green and Senator Wagner as arbitrators, and requesting the capital side to permanently abandon the means of closing factories when workers request increased wages or improved treatment, and at the same time requesting workers not to strike and send their requests to the arbitration board. The organization of the arbitration board will follow the regulations of the arbitration board that arbitrated wage disputes in factories manufacturing military supplies during the European War. At that time, the late President Taft served as the director of the board, and all disputes could be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. However, President Roosevelt's arbitration board this time is quite inclined to the labor side, and even the capital side representative Stewart is the leader of the great movement to enable all the unemployed to get jobs and receive fair wages. Senator Wagner, who is the proposer of the unemployment relief plan, has always been a great protector of the labor community, and this time he also accompanied other labor officials and large industrialists to ask the President to find a way to prevent strikes. However, the US President is personally responsible for the actions of the arbitration board and will not make a final decision without his consideration.</p>

<p>Havana, 5th (Special Dispatch): A general strike continues in Cuba today. It is widely rumored that striking workers and revolutionaries in the interior have clashed with the military and police in numerous incidents, but this has not yet been verified here. This is because telegraph personnel are also on strike, resulting in a communication breakdown. However, there have also been conflicts in the capital, injuring many people. It is anticipated that casualties have also occurred in the provinces. The strikers are now openly demanding the resignation of President Machado and the restoration of constitutional rights, which were suspended by Machado about two years ago due to political unrest. Machado remains concerned and has not yet declared martial law. He met with advisors today to discuss the situation. Many expect the strike to be a prelude to open revolution, with uprisings likely to occur in the capital and provinces in the coming days.</p>

<p>With a Participation of 180,000</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Havas): The National Socialist Party's Brownshirt military held a large-scale parade at the former Doeberitz military training ground, with a participation of 180,000 people. They were selected purely from the party military in Berlin and Brandenburg and inspected by Chief of Staff of the Party Military, Major Roehm. Roehm rode on horseback, flanked by other officers. When the National Socialist Party military was first established, it fought for revolution, and they were inspected while arranged in small groups. This time, the arrangement was almost identical to a real national army, with troop units equivalent to regiments and brigades of a formal army. During the march, they were led by an honorary banner, with two escort teams of approximately sixty people flanking it, all wearing brown shirts, steel helmets, and shouldering rifles, led by an officer holding a saber. Spectator seats required admission fees, so only 10,000 people attended, with few ordinary citizens. Most were petty-bourgeois officers, government officials, diplomatic corps representatives, and foreign National Socialists.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Poland Revises Constitution <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw, 6th (Havas): The Parliamentary Government Party held a large-scale meeting, where leader Sławek expressed his opinion advocating for a major revision of the Polish Constitution. The current Government Party holds a majority in Parliament, so the proposed constitutional revision will certainly pass. The aim of this reform is to enhance the authority of the President and place citizens in a merely "passive and defensive" position in politics. The President may issue legislative decrees at any time to govern the country. Another aim of the reform is to reorganize the Senate and enhance its power. The Senate has historically been elected by universal suffrage. According to the reform proposal, one-third of the senators will be appointed by the President, and two-thirds will be elected by a special electoral body. The new Senate will enjoy equal rights with the House of Representatives, so even if the opposition faction gradually gains importance in the House of Representatives, the government can still control the parliamentary situation.</p>

<p>Paris, 6th (Havas): French aviators Rossi and Codos departed from New York yesterday morning at 5:00 AM in an attempt to fly across the Atlantic and break the world record for the longest straight-line flight. The two pilots transmitted messages via radio, reporting their flight conditions. The Ministry of Aviation received and published the reports. One message stated, "This morning at 9:00 AM (Greenwich Mean Time), we were unable to send a report due to severe weather conditions at sea, making the flight difficult." Shortly after, another message stated, "We are battling a low-pressure system over Halifax, Canada, and it has been very difficult to cope with for five hours." At 9:45 AM, the Ministry of Aviation issued the following radio message: "We have now flown to a point approximately 1,000 kilometers from the British coast and the Isles of Scilly." Furthermore, the American mail ship Manhattan in the Atlantic received radio messages from three other ships at 9:45 AM (Greenwich Mean Time), stating that they had intercepted reports from Codos and Rossi that they had flown to a point 600 kilometers from the coast of England. Therefore, the first step of Codos and Rossi's plan has been successful.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Havas): At 1:50 PM, the Saint-Just radio station received a radio message from Codos and Rossi stating that they had flown to a point 200 miles west of "Cape Race."</p>

<p>)The Peaceful Resolution of the Chahar Situation Is Nearing Success(</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) After efforts by various parties to mediate a peaceful resolution, there is hope for the Chahar political situation, which has dragged on for more than two months. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, accompanied by Xiong Bin, Jiang Bocheng, Qin Dechun, and others, departed for Shacheng this morning (5th) at 7:45 AM, arriving around 1:00 PM. Feng Yuxiang also sent Tong Lin'ge to Shacheng at the same time to meet with Song and discuss solutions. It is said that Song will return to Beiping on the 6th. Feng will wait for Tong Lin'ge to return to Zhangjiakou and report on the meeting with Song before telegraphing on the 6th to cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. As for Feng's personal title, he has already stated that it is not an issue. Therefore, after the telegraph, he only hopes to have the freedom to reside where he pleases. Song Zheyuan will handle the Chahar situation. In general, the troops of Ji Hongchang, Sun Liangcheng, and Tong Lin'ge will all be reorganized into divisions and brigades, respectively. The various volunteer armies will retain their original designations. Fang Zhenwu's army only has the two units of Bao Gang and Zhang Renjie. Bao's unit has already been reorganized into the 45th Brigade by the Military Affairs Committee. Zhang's unit will also be reorganized, so there are no significant issues. However, Fang personally requested to be appointed as the Border Defense Commissioner of Chahar Province. The authorities here still hope that he will leave the military and be given a civilian position. This still needs further discussion.</p>
<p>Since Deng Zhexiyi brought Feng Yuxiang's telegraph on July 31st to Beiping and reported it to the authorities, there has been a turning point in the Chahar situation. He Yingqin then proposed three measures on the 3rd, telegraphing Feng to solicit his opinion. After receiving the telegram, Feng, in addition to issuing a winter telegram accepting the four principles of Jiang and Wang's telegraph, also sent Liu Zhizhou and Wang Menqing to Shacheng on the 3rd to visit Pang Bingxun, conveying Feng's letter stating that he could accept the three measures proposed by He and that he would cease military activities from the 4th, and welcome Chairman Song to return to Chahar, first restoring smooth traffic. Pang reported the situation to He Yingqin, who then summoned Qin Dechun and Xiong Bin to Jurentang on the morning of the 4th to discuss everything. He then invited Song Zheyuan to inform him that Feng welcomed him to return to office and requested him to make a final effort for Chahar and make a trip to Shacheng in order to achieve success. At the same time, Song also received telegrams from various parties urging him, stating that if the Chahar situation was prolonged for too long, it would be detrimental to the country and to himself, and that he must find a way to resolve it. Song then agreed to make the trip, and He issued an order, ordering Song to enter Shacheng, adhering to the government's intention to handle everything. After Song excused himself, he invited Deng Zhexiyi, Qin Dechun, Xiong Bin, and others at 5:00 PM for further discussions. At the same time, Feng appropriately sent a telegram to Song welcoming him, saying that he would send Tong Lin'ge to Shacheng to meet with him, hoping to indicate the time of departure. Ji Hongchang, Tong Lin'ge, and others also telegraphed Song to welcome him. Song then decided to depart for Shacheng on the morning of the 5th, and a special train and a battalion of guards were transferred to the Xizhimen Station for standby.</p>
<p>After the itinerary was decided, He sent Xiong Bin and Jiang Bocheng as representatives to accompany him. Xiong's eye disease had not yet fully recovered, so he also made an effort to go. On the morning of the 5th, at around 6:00 AM, Song, Qin, Deng, and others spoke briefly, and then dispersed. At around 7:00 AM, Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, Deng Zhexiyi, Chen Xiwen, Yang Zhennan, and others arrived at Xizhimen Station one after another. Finally, Song arrived at the station with Qin Dechun, exchanged greetings with the welcomers Men Zhizhong, He Yingqin's representative Xu Ying, and Liu Shifu, and then boarded the train. At 7:45 AM, the train departed. Before Song left Beiping, he met with visitors at the station and said that the Chahar situation had been delayed for more than two months, and the central government had consistently determined to handle it peacefully, and Chairman He was also proceeding with this goal. Recently, Mr. Feng expressed his willingness to make peace. After all, bullets belong to the country, and each one fired is one more loss. I was unable to exert myself fully due to a recurrence of my lower back pain, and I am deeply ashamed. Recently, because all parties are willing to make peace, and I received an order from the Military Affairs Committee Branch, I decided to go to Shacheng. After arriving, I will telegraph Zhangjiakou, asking Mr. Feng to send two representatives to Shacheng to discuss everything. I expect that after this negotiation, the Chahar problem can be resolved.

<h3 id="e69">Huang Fu Passes Through Hankou to Xunyang <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>)To Ask Jiang for Instructions on Handling the North China Situation(</p>
<p>(Zhang Qun Accompanies Him to Report on the Political Situation in Hubei Province) Hankou Correspondence: Huang Fu, Chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Committee, was summoned south by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He handed over the affairs of the Political Affairs Committee to Secretary-General He Qigong to handle on his behalf. He traveled south by special train from Beiping on the evening of the 3rd, accompanied only by Secretaries He and Guo, and one attendant. The train passed through Zhengzhou on the 4th, arriving in Hankou at 1:25 PM on the 5th. Many military and political figures from Wuhan went to welcome him. After Huang disembarked, he went to the General Headquarters' office in Hankou to rest and met with Cao Haosen, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, and others. At 9:00 PM that evening, he took the Jiang'an steamer to Xunyang. Zhang Qun also traveled east on the same boat to report to Chiang on the political situation in Hubei Province. It is estimated that they will arrive in Xunyang on the morning of the 6th and ascend Guling in the afternoon. Huang made a statement in Hankou, briefly stating that the North China Political Affairs Committee had been established for more than two months. During this period, it has been handling urgent and extraordinary affairs. When an event occurs, a decision must be made within three minutes and resolved within ten minutes, because delay may cause changes. The takeover of the war zone has now been completed in seventeen counties. Only Miyun and Zunhua have not yet been taken over, and it will be completed in three or four days. For post-war reconstruction in the war zone, the central government has decided to allocate 1 million yuan in cash and issue 4 million yuan in public bonds for relief efforts. It has been decided to use 2 million yuan for emergency relief and 3 million yuan for agricultural relief. War zone refugees are displaced, miserable, and starving. Emergency relief must first be used to maintain life, and the fundamental relief must be to restore the countryside and stabilize people's lives. Recalling the time of the war, homes in various places were destroyed by artillery fire, and plows and agricultural tools were looted. Therefore, agricultural relief must be implemented, and loans must be given to the people so that they can purchase all necessary tools for farming. However, the area of the Luan River East war zone is more than forty times larger than the Shanghai war zone, and the suffering of the people is even greater than in Shanghai. Therefore, the funds raised are far from sufficient. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will show their sympathy and donate as much as possible so that the survivors of the looting can recover. The Chahar incident has been happening for a long time, and there has been no result from the envoys going back and forth. The crux of the matter is that Feng and Fang must discuss military and political affairs together and resolve them at the same time. The central government must first cancel their titles and then discuss political issues. Judging from the current situation, there is no danger of an unfortunate event occurring, but I fear that prolonging it for too long will affect foreign relations, and the more disputes there will be. At this time of national crisis, all citizens should thoroughly awaken and work together harmoniously. The Political Affairs Committee will only adhere to the central government's intention to seek a solution through peaceful means for the Chahar situation. As for the suspension of traffic on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway, it is because Feng and Fang withdrew road funds and detained vehicles. However, traffic from Beiping to Xiahuayuan and from Suiyuan to Chaigoubao is still normal. The traffic on that road has not been completely cut off. In addition, reports say that the Japanese authorities dispatched the Third Fleet Commander Mineichi, who sailed to North China on the flagship Tenryu on the 2nd with the 27th Destroyer Division, suggesting some kind of action. There is no basis for this. I am going to Ganzhou tonight to meet Chiang Kai-shek and report on the situation in North China and discuss the future policy for handling political affairs. Whether I go to Nanjing or not will depend on meeting Chiang Kai-shek. (August 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Jiangxi Province Establishes Four Political Bureaus in Bandit Areas <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>)Longgang, Tengtian, Fenggang, and Xinfeng( )Using Political Power to Assist in Bandit Suppression(</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Various Red bandit groups, such as Fang Zhimin in Mount Mopan, Zhu Xianzhi in Yuanlian, and Wang Zuo and Yuan Wencai in Jinggang, all started with only a few broken rifles in poor and remote areas where political power could not reach. Previously, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a five-province bandit suppression conference in Nanchang, and the 50th Division proposed to establish county-level and assistant administrative organs in counties with vast territories and adjacent areas where the whip of authority could not reach. This was approved and handed over to the four departments of the headquarters for handling. Now, Director Zhu has determined that political power is often lacking in the Tengtian, Longgang, Fenggang, and Xinfeng areas of southeastern Jiangxi. Therefore, the above four places have been designated as special districts, with a political bureau established in each district, hoping to use political power to assist in bandit suppression. This measure has been approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who instructed the provincial government to demarcate the boundaries and prepare budget estimates for implementation. The plan is as follows: ㈠ Tengtian: located in the south of Yongfeng, including the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of Yongfeng, the second district of Le'an, and the third and eighth districts of Gaoshui. ㈡ Fenggang: located in the east of Chongren, formerly the main base of Zhu and Mao's army in the upper reaches of the Fu River, now just recovered, including the fifth and seventh districts of Chongren and the second and third districts of Yihuang. ㈢ Xinfeng: located in the far south of Yihuang, bordering Nanfeng, Le'an, and Ningdu, formerly also one of the bandit strongholds, now the bandits have withdrawn, including the seventh district of Nanfeng, the fifth district of Yihuang, and the northern district of Ningdu adjacent to Kuzhu. ㈣ Longgang: located in the area bordering Yongfeng, Jishui, Ji'an, Taihe, Xingguo, Ningdu, and Le'an, formerly a stronghold equal to Donggu and Zhaoxie, an important base of Zhu and Mao. In 1932, it was included in Pingchi County, which was changed from Donggu, but later Donggu was abandoned, and Longgang became uncivilized again. This time, the eighth district of Yongfeng, the seventh district of Jishui, and the seventh district of Ji'an are re-suppressed. Each of the above four political bureaus has an annual expenditure of 22,584 yuan to handle the recruitment of refugees, the resettlement of coerced individuals, assisting the military in blockading the bandit areas, constructing defensive works, organizing baojia teams, building roads, and handling local personnel disputes, in order to clarify the source of bandits and restore order. However, before the establishment of the Northern Route Headquarters, it is handled by the Central Route Army Headquarters. Chen Cheng, Commander of the Central Route Army, has consulted the provincial government for the appointment of the heads of the four bureaus, which will be established immediately.</p>
<p>In addition, Ninggang County, which was captured for five years, has recently been recovered by the Hunan Army. The county town is desolate and broken, with less than a hundred families, and it is extremely difficult to restore. The county magistrate, Wang Shaoqi, has been approved to move the county town to Longshi, which is conveniently located for transportation between Hunan and Jiangxi.</p>

<p>)Six or Seventy Fake Soldiers Wanted to Enter Without Buying Tickets, Shot and Killed Three Actors and Two Vendors(</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Diantong, Shenyang, 6th) The Futian Opera Troupe was performing at the Xiaohuayuan outside Dadongmen in Shenyang. Suddenly, on the afternoon of the 5th, sixty or seventy soldiers of "Manchukuo" wanted to enter the theater without buying tickets, and were refused by the theater owner. They then began to riot and fight. During the chaos, the soldiers suddenly opened fire, causing great chaos. Spectators fled in panic. As a result, three actors and two vendors were killed, and two vendors were seriously injured. The military police patrols heard the alarm and mobilized to suppress the incident. Wuxi.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Cracking Down on Counterfeit Champagne Ticket Organization <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Manager Lu of the Shanghai Times branch in Qingguoxiang, Wuxi, in addition to selling newspapers, also sold various lottery tickets, making a considerable profit. Recently, a woman named Lu Huifen purchased a Dingzhi Qingdao Grand Champagne ticket for ten yuan. Huifen did not notice it at the time, but the real Grand Champagne ticket was originally scheduled to be drawn on the 30th of last month. However, because it was the same date as the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery, the Qingdao General Office announced that it would be postponed. Lu did not know about the postponement and sent the fake number list to Lu Huifen as scheduled. After receiving it, Huifen became suspicious, wondering why a number list would be sent when the newspaper had just announced a postponement. She then wrote to the Qingdao General Office to inquire. After receiving the letter, the office immediately wrote to the Minghua Bank on Beijing Road, Shanghai, the manager of the lottery, asking them to investigate. The bank then sent employees Xu Yongsheng and Qiu Yulin to Wuxi. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, they went to the Times branch in Qingguoxiang and pretended to check the numbers. Sure enough, Lu Juyi took out a fake number list. Therefore, they immediately called the police and took Lu Juyi and the fake number list and fake Champagne tickets to the First Public Security Bureau, and presented them to the County Public Security Bureau. Chief Wu opened a court and interrogated him. Lu Juyi was ordered to be detained pending transfer to the County Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Rickshaw Pullers on General Strike <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>There are more than 50 rickshaw companies in the county, and 30 or 40 independent pullers who are not members of the union. There are a total of 2,214 rickshaws in the county. Before September of last year, the daily rental per rickshaw was four jiao of small coins and two copper coins. For rickshaws operating in Kaiyuan and Yangming townships, an additional 24 copper coins were charged. Rickshaws operating solely in the Wuxi urban area did not pay extra rent. The rickshaw owners, recognizing that the inability of rickshaws to operate uniformly in urban and rural areas greatly affected their business, decided to allow rickshaws to operate uniformly in urban and rural areas without boundaries starting on September 1st of last year. Since the unification, passengers have found it more convenient, and it was agreed that the daily rental per rickshaw would be three jiao and seven fen, equivalent to 1,380 copper coins. However, since the uniform operation and the lowering of rental prices, the economy has been in a state of panic, and business has been slow. Only 50% to 60% of rickshaws were rented out. Therefore, the smallest rickshaw companies secretly reduced rental prices to maintain their livelihoods, ranging from 600 to 800 to 1,040 copper coins per rickshaw. However, the majority of these rickshaws were old and dilapidated. Over time, most rickshaw companies also secretly reduced prices, destroying the agreement. If they did not reduce prices, no one would rent their rickshaws, so they had to comply outwardly but defy inwardly. Until recently, the silk factories in the county successively resumed operations, and commerce began to turn around. The economy gradually improved, and the number of rickshaws rented out increased daily. The rickshaw owners, realizing that they had been losing money for almost a year, convened a general membership meeting at the end of last month to discuss reorganizing rental prices. From August 6th, they would uniformly restore the price to three jiao and seven fen, and notified each rickshaw company in advance. After receiving the notice, each rickshaw company naturally informed the rickshaw pullers. The rickshaw pullers who were paying 1,040 copper coins per day did not have a problem, but the rickshaw pullers who were paying 500 to 600 copper coins per day felt greatly aggrieved and expressed their opposition, saying that the price had suddenly doubled. However, they had no organization. Yesterday (6th), after dawn, the majority of good rickshaw pullers still went to the companies to rent rickshaws. A group of rickshaw pullers who made a living by "selling shifts" went out to cause trouble. More than 100 rickshaw pullers gathered outside Guangfu Gate. The rest gathered at Yinglong Bridge outside the West Gate, and some even smashed the rickshaws on the road. Seeing this, the rickshaw pullers returned the rickshaws to their companies. In an instant, all rickshaws disappeared from the streets, and a general strike was carried out. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu received a report from the trade association the day before, requesting him to instruct the County Public Security Bureau to prevent the rickshaw pullers from taking extrajudicial actions. Yesterday morning, County Magistrate Yan received a report of the rickshaw pullers' strike and the gathering of rickshaw pullers outside Guangfu Gate and other places. He immediately telephoned the County Public Security Bureau and the County Investigation Brigade to dispatch armed police teams to various places to persuade them to return and ordered the rickshaw pullers to disperse. Because they had no unity, the rickshaw pullers gradually dispersed and waited for a solution. County Magistrate Yan instructed Technical Director Zhang Fulin and Zhao Xuchang, Xu Xingqiao, and Wang Zhiming, standing committee members of the rickshaw industry association preparatory committee, to come to the county office to discuss the reasons for the price increase. Zhao Xuchang and others presented everything in person, saying that the restoration of the original price was decided by a general membership meeting and that the matter could only be resolved by convening a general meeting to discuss solutions. They agreed to convene a temporary membership meeting at 5:00 PM to discuss solutions and immediately took their leave. However, the county government believed that the procedure was improper and that they should have reported to the county government and issued a notice in advance, and then this problem would not have occurred. The rickshaw owners were determined to achieve a rental price of three jiao and seven fen per rickshaw per day. Starting from that day, only 70% of the rickshaws would be released, and the remaining 30% of the licenses would be deposited in the trade association to prevent compliance outwardly but defiance inwardly. The remaining 30% of the old and dilapidated rickshaws would be repaired. All monthly licenses and monthly donations would still be paid as before. For this reason, the rickshaw rental price could not be reduced any further. The County Chamber of Commerce also paid close attention to this matter and encouraged the rickshaw owners to make slight concessions to resolve the matter immediately and avoid accidents, and asked County Magistrate Yan to instruct them to pay attention to local security. By noon, there were no rickshaw pullers on the streets, so order was as usual. Whether the rickshaw pullers can resume work immediately depends on whether the rickshaw owners can make concessions.</p>

The total amount of opium seized was over 3,000 taels. Boatmen Wang Xiaolao and Song Lao received over 1,500 taels each. After selling off more than 1,000 taels, over 2,000 taels were seized by the police teams and divided. The police first detachment leader, Min Wei, received 100 taels.

This led to a conflict. At first, the two were just wrestling, but Hu Lianshun was knocked to the ground by two slaps to the cheek and died shortly afterward. Qian, realizing he had caused a major disaster, turned and fled. By the time the police arrived, he was gone. The Second Branch sent officers to Qian's house and arrested A Shui's father, Xiaoliu, to take to the station to prepare documents for transfer to the court. The corpse was inspected on the spot by Feng Yongnian, a coroner from the local court's prosecutor's office. Because the cause of death was peculiar, a formal autopsy is required.</p>

<p>The home of Wang Changquan at No. 29, Huian Bridge, Daguan, Hushen, was robbed of gold jewelry, cash, and other items worth over 500 yuan on the evening of the 23rd of last month at around 9:00 PM. At the time, the news was received late, so the bandits could not be intercepted. After looting Wang's home, the bandits crossed the river and hid in Xiaoshan. They were discovered and arrested by the Xiaoshan County Public Security Bureau yesterday. Many beads were found on the spot. Under interrogation, they confessed their names as Ding Xiaosan, "Pockface," 28 years old, from Jiangbei, and admitted to colluding with eight others last month to rob Wang's home in Daguan, Hushen. They also said the ringleader is now hiding in Shanghai. After verifying the confession, the bureau prepared documents and, along with the stolen goods, escorted them to Hangzhou, where they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for review.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Impact on the Two Industries After the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Silver Smelting Industry and Public Valuation Bureau</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance Implemented the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan, All Transactions Were Changed to Silver Coins, and Silver Reserves From All Over Were Concentrated in Shanghai, Which Greatly Affected the Business of the Silver Smelting Industry and the Public Valuation Bureau, Which Have a History of Hundreds of Years, After the Abolition of Taels Is Completed, They Will Be Closed Down, According to the Details Obtained by the New Sound News Reporter,</p>
<h3 id="e92">Business Situation of the Silver Smelting Industry <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Silver Smelting Industry is a Place for Processing Silver and Casting Treasures, Which Was Founded in the Song Dynasty, Because the Treasures From Other Places Were of Different Fineness, They All Had to Be Recast, Either by Melting Silver Bars or by Recasting Small Foreign Coins, The Silver Smelting Industry Was Entrusted by Banks and Money Shops to Engage in This Recasting Business, If It Was Entrusted by a Bank, the Bank Calculated the Comparison Between Large Silver Bars and Shanghai Ingots, Delivered the Large Bars to the Silver Smelting Industry, and the Silver Smelting Industry Issued a Promissory Note to the Bank as the Silver Smelting Industry's Debt to the Bank, The Procedure Was Equivalent to Discounting a Bill, A Silver Smelting Industry With Good Credit Could Issue a Promissory Note, and a Slightly Less Credible One Had to Have Three Silver Smelting Industries Guarantee Each Other, Limiting One or Two Days After the Ingot Was Cast, It Would Be Delivered to the Bank, If the Bank Entrusted Recasting Treasures From Other Places, the Procedure Was the Same, If the Fineness of the Ingots From Other Places Was Better, the Silver Smelting Industry Still Had to Pay a Discount of Two or Three Taels, If It Was Entrusted by a Money Shop, the Money Shop Estimated How Much the Delivered Ingots or Small Foreign Coins Were Worth in Shanghai Ingots, Agreed With the Silver Smelting Industry, and the Silver Smelting Industry Would Return the Cast Ingots to the Money Shop Within One Day, In Short, the Cast Ingots Had to Be Sent to the Public Valuation Bureau for Approval Before They Could Be Delivered to the Bank or Money Shop,</p>
<p>The Silver Smelting Industry's Organization is the Silver Smelting Guild, Located at the Mouth of Tianhougong Bridge, Henan Road, The Following Are the Most Recent Silver Smelting Industries, Lian Shen, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Tong Shen, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Lian Yuan, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Zhi Qing, Tong Qing, Qingyuanli, Beijing Road, Tong Yuan, Wufuli, Beijing Road, Sheng Tai, Qingyuanli, Beijing Road, Tong Yu, Wan'anli, Beijing Road, Sheng Yuan, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Tai Heng Yuan, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Feng Chang, Fushunli, Beijing Road, Tai Sheng, Wufunong, Tianjin Road, Qia Mao, Fushunli, Beijing Road, Hui Tai, Fushunli, Beijing Road, Sheng Xing, Changgengli, Sanyangjing Road,</p>
<h3 id="e93">Inevitably Closed Down <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the Government Ordered the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan, Silver and Ingots Cannot Circulate in the Market, Therefore, the Silver Smelting Industry is Naturally Eliminated, Now That the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan Has Not Been Implemented for Long, Silver From All Over is Being Continuously Transported to Shanghai, Either Delivered to Banks and Money Shops, or Exchanged for Silver Coins, Because the Types of Silver Are Different, Such as Horseshoe-Shaped, Four-Way and Fragmented Silver, Etc., Their Fineness is Inconsistent, Resulting in No Way to Judge, It Must Be Melted Into Ingots by the Silver Smelting Industry and Then Appraised by the Public Valuation Bureau Before It Can Be Exchanged for Silver Coins and Delivered to Banks and Money Shops, If the Abolition of Taels is Successful and Silver Disappears From the Market, Then the Silver Smelting Industry Will Inevitably Be Closed Down at That Time,</p>
<h3 id="e94">Public Valuation Bureau's Public Valuation Method <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Valuation Bureau Was Founded by Wang Lantin From Anhui and is Recognized by Silver and Money Shops, It Has Been Nearly a Hundred Years Since Then, The Address Is at the Intersection of Tianjin Road and Jiangxi Road, The Ingots on the Market Must Be Approved by the Public Valuation Bureau Before They Can Be Used, The Approval Fee is Two Cents and Four Li Per Ingot, If There is Any Smuggling or Omission of Approval, After It Is Found Out, the Approval Fee Will Be Extracted, After the Approved Ingots Are Recalled by Each Family, They Must Be Restored to Their Original Level One by One, If There Is Any Difference in Weight, It Should Be Corrected Immediately, Otherwise the Public Valuation Bureau Will Not Be Responsible, The Public Valuation Method Has Two Types, 1) Weighing, 2) Assessing Fineness, Weighing is Called Managing the Scale, Assessing Fineness is Called Looking at the Fineness, When Doing Public Valuation, First Wipe the Central Concave Part of the Ingot Clean and Hand It Over to the Person Managing the Scale to Weigh It, Then Record Its Weight in the Concave Part With Ink, Then the Person Looking at the Fineness Uses His Eyesight to Judge the Superiority or Inferiority of Its Fineness and Records It in the Central Concave Part, Generally Speaking, the Higher the Fineness, the Approval is Shenshui Two Taels Seven Qian Five Fen, The Lower the Fineness, the Approval is Shenshui Two Taels Six Qian Five Fen, If It Weighs More Than Forty-Nine Taels and Eight Qian, Each Tael is Shen Five Fen, If the Fineness is Below Two Taels and Six Qian Five Fen, It Will Not Be Approved, This Refers to the Ingots Produced by the Shanghai Smelting House, Each Ingot is Standardized at Forty-Nine Taels and Eight Qian, If It Is a Treasure From Various Provinces, Shenshui is Approved According to Common Practice, If It Is a Low-Fineness Treasure, Removing Water to More Than One Tael Will Not Be Approved, If the Person Looking at the Fineness Has Any Doubts, He Can Use a Fangxian Cone to Drill in to Check the Fineness of the Inside, and Then Record It, This Kind of Assessing Fineness Depends Entirely on His Daily Experience,</p>
<h3 id="e95">Temporarily Maintaining the Status Quo <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>After the Abolition of Taels and the Change to Yuan is Implemented, the Silver Smelting Industry is Naturally Eliminated, and the Public Valuation Bureau Was Originally a Public Valuation Business for Ingots Melted by the Silver Smelting Industry, Which is Closely Related to the Silver Smelting Industry, Therefore, Those Who Are Affected Accordingly, If the Silver Smelting Industry is Closed Down, Then the Public Valuation Bureau Will Inevitably Be Unable to Do Public Valuation, But Silver, Which Has Been Used for Hundreds of Years in Our Country's History, Is Either a Habit or Affects the Whole Country, Now Although the Government Has Implemented the Abolition of Taels, It Cannot Be Completely Abolished in One or Two Years, Therefore, It Is Difficult to Realize the Suspension of Business of the Banking Industry, the Smelting Industry and the Public Valuation Bureau for a While, Now All Industries Are Taking Silver to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China to Exchange for Silver Coins, Which Also Depends on the Public Valuation of the Public Valuation Bureau, Therefore, It Is Said That the Ministry of Finance Will Appoint Talents Familiar With Public Valuation to Supervise the Public Valuation Bureau for Great Faith,</p>

<h3 id="e106">Anhui Native Place Association Sends a Letter to the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Magistrate of He County Dismantles the Stone Sluice, Endangering the Riverbank</p>
<p>Representatives from the Two Weirs Come to Shanghai to Beg for Assistance</p>
<p>The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai recently received a report from the gentry of He County, stating that the Hekou Stone Sluice, jointly owned by Wu Ran and Zheng Village in the county, had been built by the government to form a complete riverbank and prevent flooding forever. Unexpectedly, the magistrate of He County sent a team to forcibly dismantle it. They requested assistance to protect the livelihoods of the people of the two weirs. The association specifically forwarded a letter to the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission, stating that according to the letter from Yi Pinshan and others, representatives of the Wu Liang Weir and Zheng Cun Weir in He County, the two weirs, with a circumference of hundreds of miles, are home to tens of thousands of residents and are the richest in the entire county. Between the two weirs is the Lao Xia River, only ten miles away from the Yangtze River. Whenever the river floods, the river flow inundates, and disasters occur when the weir is breached. Magistrate Gao of the thirteenth year of the Republic, after the flood receded, examined the river connecting to the Yangtze River and found that it had more disadvantages than advantages. Therefore, he built a stone sluice at the mouth of the river to open and close it at times. Before the twentieth year of the Republic, there were no floods, which was truly thanks to this. Last year, the National Government repaired the dikes along the Yangtze River and examined the Lao Xia River mouth stone sluice, realizing that there was no need to open it. Therefore, it was strengthened and closed, forming a complete riverbank. The people of the two weirs were all grateful that the floods could be avoided, like the Great Wall. Unexpectedly, a few gentry in Laoqiao Street presented a petition to Magistrate Zhang, ordering him to send a guard team to forcibly demolish the sluice bridge. After the people of the two weirs argued with reason, the demolition was not immediately carried out. More than ten people from the two weirs were taken to the county and detained by the county team, with a deadline of June 20th to demolish it voluntarily, issuing a certificate of guarantee, with severe punishment for violations. Under these circumstances, the people of the weir dared not disobey the order and issued the certificate. However, after the sluice bridge is demolished, the riverbank will be as good as useless. Once the river floods and the raging tide inundates, the weir will break, the fields will be submerged, and the people will become fish. The county magistrate's strict deadline is imminent, and their lives are at stake, so there is no way to do anything. Therefore, they specifically requested your committee to provide assistance, etc. The letter has arrived at the association. The letter states that the Lao Xia River mouth stone sluice is deeply related to the interests of the Wu Liang and Tu Cun weirs. Moreover, when your office repaired the riverbank and closed the stone sluice in the past, it was after thorough investigation and weighing the interests. Now, whether it should be allowed to be demolished or not, your office has its own discretion. In addition to telegraphing the Anhui Provincial Government to order the He County County Government to stop it, it is appropriate to send a letter stating the situation immediately, hoping that you will check and handle it to appease public opinion, and hoping to reply.</p>

<p>Price Dumping to Control Our Fishermen and Fish Merchants</p>
<p>Establishing Companies and Schools for Large-Scale Aggression</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Japanese fishing aggression has adopted an active policy to oppress fishermen and disrupt the market, which has been seen countless times. The fishing industry has recently received confirmed reports that Japan has further plans, which is to use a price dumping policy to put our fishermen and fish merchants to death. It has secretly ordered its fishing boats to implement two things, namely: 1) to actively engage in fishing in the coastal provinces of China and dump the fish nearby; 2) to equip refrigeration warehouses at various ports in Taiwan, Japan, and on regular shipping routes to sell large quantities of fish products to the coastal provinces and cities of China. In addition, the Japanese government has sent many people to investigate the fisheries of the coastal provinces of our country in great detail, such as the location of fishing grounds, the duration of the fishing season, the quantity of fish caught, the types of aquatic animals, the areas of habitat, and the conditions of migration. Recently, it has even colluded with traitors to organize the Asia Fisheries Company, using its strong capital for planned aggression and to train a large number of aquatic product aggressors, planning to establish a large-scale aquatic product school in Dalian.</p>

<p>The Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission recently received a report from the Jiangxi-Ganzhou Engineering Bureau that the Xiaolaozhou area of the lower section of the Mahua Dike was in extreme danger due to the collapse of the outer small weir, which caused the Yangtze River waves to directly impact the main dike. With the cooperation of the local people, they did their best to rescue it. Now, the pile driving, soil filling, and the first and second additions of sub-dikes have all been completed, and the danger has been reduced. The third addition of the sub-dike is underway, and strict patrols are being carried out to prevent negligence. In addition, the soil in the Majiawo to Qianjiangkou area of Guangji Weir is sandy and thin. Leakage was found and blocked by pile driving and washing. The inner slope was also strengthened to provide defense. In addition, after the breach of the Xiadacheng Weir in Tongcheng County was blocked and closed, barriers were built and soil was filled on the outer slope, and sack were stacked for protection. The work has been completed, and workers are still stationed there for strict patrols and timely reports to facilitate repairs.</p>

<p>Jointly Sent a Letter to the Native Place Association Requesting Assistance in Forwarding a Petition to the Municipal Government to Withdraw the Order to Build a Vegetable Market on the Railway Station Road</p>
<p>Businessmen and vegetable vendors in Jiangyin Street, Nanjing, are extremely panicked because a vegetable market is about to be built on the Railway Station Road. They have submitted petitions to the主管官廳 requesting to withdraw the order to comfort the businessmen and stabilize public sentiment. However, they have not received any official approval to cancel it. Therefore, Zhuangzhu Fan Gongliang and Yu Miaofa, the owner of Dechang Leg Shop, and 70 other people have specifically sent a letter to Ningbo Native Place Association and President Yu Qiaqing, requesting assistance. It is known that yesterday, Meng Changyou, Mo Arui, Chen Bajin, Bi Ada, Ding Ahua, Zhu Bingquan, Ding Achun, Shen Wanxiang, Zhou Dalin, Mo Jinrui, Lin Kaitai, Wei Ashi, Zhou Heshang, Wei Wujiu, Jiang Yougu, Wei Ayong, Ni Sijiu, Wei Axiang, Sun Qier, Wang Fuchang, Pan Ronghua, Xie Lianzh, Song Changfu, Tao Yongfang, Wang Jintang, Yu Aniu, Mo Afang, Dong Yougen, Mo Ayuan, and more than a hundred other merchants of Shaoxing origin jointly signed and sealed a letter to the Shaoxing Native Place Association, detailing the reasons why merchants and vegetable vendors opposed the construction of a vegetable market on the Railway Station Road.

<h3 id="e113">The Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Sub-Bureau of Shanghai and Baoshan Issues a Notice to Collect Taxes on Liquor and Beer <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Huang Yong (also known as Yuru), the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Sub-Bureau of Jiangsu Shanghai and Baoshan, issued a notice yesterday, stating: According to the report submitted by Ding Xie, the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office, I have been entrusted to handle the collection of tobacco and alcohol license taxes, and I should be responsible for supervising the collection and strive to reorganize it, in order to live up to the intention of seeking truth from facts. I have investigated that Article 3, Item 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol License Taxes promulgated by the Ministry stipulates that those who simultaneously operate tobacco, alcohol, or foreign alcohol or simultaneously engage in wholesale and retail should obtain licenses separately and pay taxes according to the amount. It is definitely not the case that one alcohol or tobacco license can be used to operate other various types of tobacco and alcohol. The meaning is already very clear. Currently, there are quite a few tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shanghai and Baoshan who simultaneously operate beer, which is a type of foreign alcohol. Most of them have not followed the regulations. This not only violates the Ministry's regulations but also hinders national taxes. At this time when we are trying to reorganize, it is not appropriate to allow them to muddle through. In addition to the director sending personnel to persuade them from house to house, it is now the peak season for beer sales. I would like to ask your bureau to issue a notice quickly, stating that all tobacco and alcohol merchants who also operate beer should obtain licenses separately and pay taxes according to the amount, and submit them to our office for posting separately, so that the public can know. Is this appropriate? I beg you to approve and implement it. According to this, the types of tobacco and alcohol licenses have clear regulations, and alcohol and foreign alcohol must be licensed separately. Now that it is summer, it is the peak season for beer sales, and all tobacco and alcohol merchants and others who also operate beer of this type should obtain licenses separately. It is not appropriate to take advantage of a tobacco or alcohol license. It is related to national taxes. According to the previous situation, in addition to instructing the collection office to conduct a thorough investigation and persuade them properly, if there are any of the above circumstances, they must obtain licenses separately in accordance with the regulations to increase tax revenue. A notice is hereby issued, and all commercial establishments in Shanghai and Baoshan that also operate beer, tobacco, and alcohol must comply and not violate it.</p>

<p>Commercial Vehicles Are Generally Not Detained</p>
<p>The XiangSheng Motor Company in this city was previously caught and detained by the Public Security Bureau for transporting contraband goods in its chartered vehicles. The company reported to the Rental Car Association that the driver should be responsible for transporting contraband goods, which has nothing to do with the car. The association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the Public Security Bureau improve the vehicle detention measures. The Public Security Bureau convened a joint meeting of the Social Affairs and Public Utilities Bureaus to discuss the matter in detail and decided on the following measures: 1) Vehicles that violate traffic regulations shall not be detained, except for the vehicle detention measures stipulated in the city's regulations on penalties. The police on duty can record the license plate number and report it for verification. 2) If a driver is careless and causes injury to another person's body or property, the driver should be responsible. In addition to detaining the driver and handling the case according to law, the vehicle should be immediately notified to the owner to retrieve it. However, after a commercial vehicle is registered with the Public Utilities Bureau, it should immediately take out third-party insurance with the Chinese Insurance Company to ensure that the victim can be compensated for the loss. 3) If there is smuggling of contraband goods or serious cases (robbery, kidnapping, murder, reaction), for private vehicles, the driver and the vehicle should be detained and dealt with according to law. For commercial vehicles, in addition to detaining the driver and investigating whether he knew about it and handling it according to law, the vehicle should be immediately notified to the owner to retrieve it. The above measures have been sent by the Public Security Bureau to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and ordered to all district offices and teams to comply with them.</p>

<p>The night soil collectors of the Hujia Muqiao Cleaning Station in Yinxiang District of this city, under the direction of the Seventh District Cleaning Workers' Union, collect a chamber pot donation of five cents per household per month. The collectors are aggressive. The other day, an extortion attempt and assault occurred on an elderly woman surnamed Liu at 3 Lüe Tianfeng Lane, Zhangjiagang. The merchants and residents of the district believe that this trend should not be encouraged, as it may lead to future problems. There is no possibility of accidental extortion fees for cleaning. The local fees that should be paid have been added to the total donation by the municipal government, and other donations and fees shall not be collected privately. The Sanitation Bureau's Order No. 1577 explicitly prohibits the night soil collectors from extorting gratuities. Now, the night soil collectors are actually disobeying orders and using the union as a shield to extort violently from households, causing widespread fear among the people. The citizens held a citizens' meeting at the Hujia Muqiao Fire Station at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, attended by more than 60 representatives from various streets. Zhang Peishen was elected as chairman. The result of the discussion was to unanimously reject this gratuity. A request was also submitted to the municipal government and the Sanitation Bureau for explanation and verification. Ten people, including Zhang Peishen, Teng Zhixiang, Lu Rongguang, and Dai Liming, were elected as the representatives to sign and submit the request. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Long Daozhen, a new patrol officer from Guangdong in the Second District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently suddenly extorted gratuities (commonly known as "taking bribes") from small vendors selling flowers and trees in his jurisdiction, and openly ordered his friends Mr. Ma (living at No. 12, Front Building, Sande Lane, Wansheng Bridge, West Gate) and Mr. Yang to lobby the small vendors. The initial asking price was 100 yuan per month, but after consultation, they had to pay according to each household. Those who had paid included vendor Cheng Azhang (28 years old, living at No. 48, Yinyu Lane, Xieqiao), who paid 3 yuan on the 22nd of last month; Yao Baobao (26 years old, living at No. 30, Wansheng Bridge Road, Laoximen), who paid 3 yuan; Wu Chengxun (30 years old, living at No. 3, Genyi Lane, Tangjiawan), who paid 4 yuan; Sun Amao (22 years old), who paid 4 yuan; Lin Heshang (27 years old, living at No. 5, Shundeli Lane, Tangjiawan), who paid 3 yuan; and Lu Jinhai (28 years old, living at No. 14, Xiaocaichang, Tangjiawan), who paid 4 yuan. Patrol Officer Long was still not satisfied and wanted to continue extorting. The Flower and Tree Industry Association learned of this and held a meeting to decide to submit a request to the Second District General Office and the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate the patrol officer. Knowing that his guilt was unforgivable, he urgently ordered Ma and Yang to flee, hoping to shirk his responsibility. However, Mr. Ma was arrested yesterday by the leader of the Second District Detective Team, Wu Xiufeng, at No. 10, Shunan Lane, Changchun Road, Zhabei. The complaint of the vendors is copied below: "The purpose of this is to accuse public officials of extorting gratuities from small vendors and request their dismissal and investigation to ensure the livelihood of the vendors. We are all law-abiding poor people who make a living by selling fruits, vegetables, etc. in the Xiaocaichang area of Tangjiawan, Laoximen. Unexpectedly, Patrol Officer Long Daozhen, who was newly transferred to our department, has been in office for a month and specializes in extorting gratuities from small vendors. If he is not satisfied, he will be driven away, forbidden from selling, arbitrarily arrested, punished, and arbitrarily beaten. The victims are countless. We are afraid of the power of the officials and have no choice. Unexpectedly, Patrol Officer Long secretly sent Ma and Yang to repeatedly intimidate and mediate the fees. In order to maintain the livelihood of our families, we endured and paid three or four yuan per stall to make a living. We believe that since you have been in power, all people have relied on protection, and civilians live and work in peace and contentment. How can there be such public officials who abuse their power to extort gratuities, squander money, and disregard the livelihood of civilians? We cannot be at peace. We have no choice but to ask you to investigate and verify and quickly dismiss Patrol Officer Long, punish him with the punishment he deserves, to ensure the livelihood and maintain the law. This is both a public and private virtue. Presented by District Chief Jin."</p>

<p>The Ministry's Approval of the Proposed Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection previously received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, following a communication from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the request from Tao Yin, the Vice-Consul at the Consulate in Liverpool, to improve tea leaves and promote international trade, as previously reported in the newspaper. Now, the Bureau believes that there are debatable points in Vice-Consul Tao's proposed methods for trial planting Indian tea. Therefore, it has specifically drafted opinions and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for instructions. Yesterday, it received approval from the Ministry, stating that the proposed methods are appropriate and instructing them to purchase tea seeds for trial planting promptly. The original submission and the Ministry's instructions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Original Submission) Regarding the matter of submitting a report: We have received instruction No. 17131 from your ministry, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has communicated, etc. Attached to this instruction is a copy of the original submission. Upon receiving this, we have reviewed the points made by Tao Yin, Vice-Consul at the Consulate in Liverpool, which are quite detailed, and the trial planting of Indian tea seems feasible. However, we have found that the main reasons for the annual decline in the export of Chinese tea are the complexity of tea garden varieties, the age of the trees, and poor manufacturing methods. In view of this, this Bureau has specifically joined the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute and the Hankou Bureau of Commodity Inspection this year in submitting a request to your ministry to establish a tea improvement farm in Ningzhou, Jiangxi Province. This is currently being planned, and a thorough study of various aspects of planting and manufacturing will be conducted. In one or two years, considerable results should be achieved. If Indian tea is promoted for planting immediately, not only will it be difficult for farmers to imitate, but also, due to poor manufacturing methods and the climate and soil, the effectiveness of foreign varieties is uncertain. We now propose the following methods for trial planting Indian tea: please first have your ministry specifically consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct consuls in India and Ceylon to collect dozens of varieties of tea seeds and distribute them to the Ningzhou Tea Improvement Farm, the Anhui and Hunan Tea Experiment Farms, and agricultural agencies in various regions for initial trial planting. After four or five years, trial manufacture should be conducted according to Indian and Ceylon tea manufacturing methods. If it is indeed superior to Chinese varieties, then suitable land should be selected for distribution to the public for imitation planting. Although this method may take more time, it is more reliable and seems to be a necessary step in propagating new varieties. Before receiving these instructions, we have informed various tea merchants so that those who are interested can conduct their own research and trial planting. We hereby submit these methods for proceeding with the planting of Indian tea to your ministry for review and approval. Please make a decision and implement accordingly. (Respectfully submitted).</p>
<p>(Ministry's Reply) We have received your submission. After reviewing it, we find the proposed methods appropriate. We have already consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the consulates in Calcutta to investigate the prices and shipping costs of Indian and Ceylon tea seeds and the procedures for mail-order purchase, so that the tea farms can be informed and purchase seeds for trial planting as appropriate. You are hereby notified.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Municipal Zoo to Hold Animal Competitions <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>(Expansion of the Zoo Site Can Be Realized)</p>
<p>Seeking Donations and Foster Care of Animals (Since the Shanghai Municipal Zoo opened on the first of this month, it has been extremely crowded with visitors, averaging over 10,000 people per day. Ticket revenue is approximately 140 to 150 yuan per day. We are now exploring various news about the zoo, which is divided and recorded below.)</p>
<p>(Planning to Expand the Zoo Grounds)</p>
<p>Since the opening of the zoo, the number of visitors has been surprisingly high, making the zoo grounds feel quite small, and the zoo paths need to be widened. Therefore, expansion is being planned. Recently, contact has been made to purchase the Wei family cemetery behind the zoo at a negotiated price, which is likely to be successful. In addition, there are dozens of houses behind the zoo, which are public properties and can also be demolished in the future to expand the zoo grounds. With the current space, even if there is money to purchase other exotic animals, there is no space available for placement.</p>
<p>(Encouraging Donations and Foster Care) In order to increase the variety of animals, the zoo is specifically soliciting donations or foster care from the public and private sectors and has established reward regulations. Those who donate animals worth more than two yuan will receive entrance tickets or annual passes, and nameplates will be erected in the zoo to commemorate their contributions. Those who donate animals of great value may also have their names published in the newspaper to express gratitude. Those who donate animals worth less than two yuan will also receive entrance tickets.</p>
<p>(Holding Animal Competitions)</p>
<p>Currently, the zoo intends to hold various animal competitions or exhibitions to arouse public interest. The competitions that are currently being negotiated and prepared are the Frisian canary competition, for which prizes have been prepared for the winning bird owners. In addition, a specimen room has been opened, and some self-made specimens of dead snakes, monkeys, bears, roe deer, etc., are displayed. An order has been placed with 邏定 for a giant elephant. Plans are underway to open an aquarium, etc. As for the required funds, it is proposed that the daily ticket revenue be submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau and designated specifically for expansion.</p>
<p>(Early Cutoff for Ticket Sales) The zoo's opening hours are stipulated to be from morning to 12:00 noon and from afternoon to 6:00 pm. However, to ensure timely closure, the ticket sales time is cut off half an hour early, at 11:30 am and 5:30 pm, after which no entry is allowed. However, people who are unaware of this often arrive late, making the trip in vain.</p>
<p>(Statement on Feeding Tigers) Yesterday morning, the zoo received a letter from the China Animal Protection Association stating that it had been reported that live pigeons were being skinned and fed to tigers, and requesting that this be prohibited. According to Director Shen, this is not accurate. The lions, tigers, leopards, etc., in this zoo are fed beef every day. However, to adjust their nutritional intake, they are fed chicken once a week, but not live. The chickens are killed first, cut into pieces, and then provided. However, recently, it has been found that the chickens have a plague, and there are concerns about the impact, so pigeons were fed instead last Wednesday. The pigeons were first suffocated with a small string around their mouths, plucked, and then fed. However, on that day, one pigeon was not suffocated thoroughly and revived after death, leading to this incident. However, this was only seen by some. Attention will be paid to this in the future. This intention has been conveyed to the Association in a letter. The zoo welcomes suggestions from the outside world to improve operations.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Expressions of European Buddhists After Coming to China <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>"A Revolutionary China Can Save the World. Reliance on the League of Nations is Futile; Salvation Depends on Oneself." (Xin Xin News Agency) Ten Buddhists from France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and other countries, including Bira, Apollo, Sitiputuo, Upala, Anukung Baijia, Patida, Patila Fa, Niaofa Ba, Shashipu, and Darubi, arrived in Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Rosso on the 25th of last month. They were received by their teacher, Monk Zhaokong, and resided at 131 Da Xi Road. They plan to study Chinese for two years and then go to Baohua Mountain in Nanjing to receive ordination and take refuge in the Three Jewels. This has already been reported. It is now known that Monk Zhaokong and Bira, etc., came to Shanghai to become monks out of admiration for Eastern culture. They noted that China, despite its national difficulties, still maintains the virtues of tolerance and peace and a genuine inner civilization, which is truly commendable. Therefore, they drafted a letter titled "Monk Zhaokong and European Buddhists Coming to China to the Chinese People," which describes the comparison between Chinese and Western cultures in great detail. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency has translated the original text below:</p>
<p>(Advocating Peace) We, foreign Buddhist disciples, the first group, have arrived in two groups on the compassionate and welcoming shores of China. I will now, in my name and in the name of my disciples, express our sentiments to China and the Chinese people. First and foremost, I must express our deepest gratitude to you. Europe is a world of exaggeration, arrogance, deceit, injustice, depravity, and materialism. Their policy towards us peaceful Chinese Buddhist monks is no different from their previous treatment of China. Instead of relying on responsible government agencies, they rely on irresponsible individuals who bring their Christian (!) gunboats and various methods of pseudo-holy Christian governments to extort and seize vast amounts of Chinese land. If we were to invent a poisonous method that could kill 500,000 people in five seconds and take it back to Europe, we would surely receive enthusiastic cheers and various honors, and countless amounts of money would fall before us. However, my return to Europe would be as a lowly Buddhist monk. I advocate for peace. My sympathy lies with all of humanity. We gather people from various countries, sincerely and selflessly, loving each other and living in peace. This is something that those lying politicians and dishonest conferences cannot do and cannot tolerate in so-called progressive and civilized Europe. This is unmistakable proof that all truth, justice, and honesty have been declared bankrupt.</p>
<p>(China Saves the World) I am now returning to China, accompanied by men and women of loyalty and sincerity. They are all willing to follow the path of enlightenment and take refuge in the Buddha's teachings. Although China is currently in a state of turmoil, it still maintains the virtues of tolerance and peace and a genuine inner civilization. As such, China far surpasses the corrupt and deceitful West. China, fortunately unaffected by European thought, is a country of sages and wise men. We offer our respects to China and the Chinese people. Only in China can we recognize the true path of life. Only in China can we be close to truth and reality. Only in China can we receive the noble discipline of Buddhist monks. The phenomena of turmoil, disharmonious psychology, senseless competition, and blind exploration are unavoidable in today's China. However, beneath this phenomenon, there is still much wisdom and knowledge, and true love can be found in the ancient land of China. O China, the repository and preserver of ancient civilization, we offer our respects to you. Today, Christianized West is gradually collapsing under its evil and foolish policies. A revolutionary China may be able to save this devastated world, not relying on military force, not relying on money, not relying on oil, cotton, rubber, etc., but relying on its goodness, truth, justice, fairness, and its true unity of purpose. O China, the compassionate protector of a world of sinful deceit, we come to China not to teach China foolish doctrines but to learn wisdom from China. We hope and believe that our arrival will bring great benefits. We will dedicate ourselves to moral and spiritual innovation, which is what the world lacks and needs most.</p>
<p>(Denouncing the League of Nations) Within the Jue Lu of Da Xi Road, we now have people from seven countries who, under China's peaceful and tolerant culture, live together as one family, speaking with one voice. We can achieve such merit. Europe has no place to accommodate us, but China welcomes us with open arms. Furthermore, the kindness shown to us by the Chinese people is worthy of our praise. Inner civilization and nobility of thought are lacking in Christian nations but still exist in China. We are willing to be China's loyal and sincere friends. When the need arises, we are willing to offer our services. We wish China peace, prosperity, and tranquil happiness. However, we must say that China must shift its gaze from admiring the West and focus on its own greatness. Those who sow evil will reap its consequences. The way to save an individual and save a nation is not to rely on others, even if they are famous. In reality, they are empty, false, and deceitful, like the "League of Nations." Therefore, to seek salvation, one must rely on one's own knowledge, one's own strength, and one's own struggle. Regarding this point, I may have more to contribute. May China and the Chinese people be happy. May all sentient beings be happy.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Lai Wu Sues Lawyer Li Chunsen for False Accusation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Stating that Lai Huayin was ordered to go home after being found in Li's residence, so there was no need to rob, and there was no intimidation of others. Our newspaper received two identical letters from lawyers Wen Dairong and Ding Zheming, stating that the news report about the lawsuit between Li Chunsen and Lai Wu was entirely Li Chunsen's one-sided account. We are copying a copy of Lai Wu's defense and counterclaim and asking for it to be published. Last night, Lai Tiansheng of the D'Epis tobacco store, Lai Zhenhuan, came to the office to request this. Therefore, we are recording Lai Wu's counterclaim as follows: Falsely accusing, stating the truth, clarifying grievances, and filing a counterclaim. Requesting a legal investigation. My late husband, Lai Mingsan, had three sons and three daughters. The youngest daughter, Huayin, who was born to me, is currently nineteen years old and not yet of age. She studied at a fine arts school and usually abides by the rules and has never acted improperly. However, Shen Tongjia, initially using the pretext of being a classmate, often came to our home and induced her in various ways. He then repeatedly wrote letters urging her to leave the family. On June 30th of this year, he sent another letter to my daughter, urging her to leave the family as soon as possible. Therefore, my daughter suddenly disappeared without a trace that day. We searched everywhere, but could not find her. I was heartbroken, unable to eat or sleep. On July 11th, I suddenly received a letter from lawyer Li Chunsen, stating that he was acting on behalf of my daughter to analyze my husband's estate and that I was required to go to 45 Pushi Road within three days to negotiate. Since lawyer Li Chunsen was appointed as my daughter's agent, he should know my daughter's whereabouts. I immediately went to the lawyer's office to inquire. Unexpectedly, the lawyer repeatedly forced me to sign an acknowledgment that my daughter was marrying Shen Tongjia. I immediately refused, stating that I must see my daughter Huayin before I could decide. The lawyer said that as long as I signed the acknowledgment, seeing my daughter would not be a problem. The lawyer then brought my daughter down from the upstairs of his residence at 45 Pushi Road. I knew that something was wrong. My young daughter, Huayin, had been abducted and had been missing for many days. Now that I had finally found her, it was even more difficult for me to allow her to be induced to stay outside for a long time. I immediately ordered her to go home with me. Unexpectedly, the lawyer strongly prevented this and refused to allow me to take my daughter Huayin back, insisting on keeping my daughter at his place. Shocked and heartbroken, I burst into tears. The lawyer grabbed my daughter and would not let her go. Since Huayin was young, I could not allow her to be induced to stay outside, and the lawyer was also in his youth, so it was also difficult to allow her to stay at the lawyer's place. Therefore, it was imperative to take my daughter Huayin back to educate her. I said that if the lawyer did not let my daughter go home, I would rather die at the lawyer's place. Subsequently, neighbors, filled with indignation, came to prevent the lawyer's illegal actions, and I was finally able to bring my daughter home. Lawyer Li Chunsen is a lawyer. How could he dare to use an underage girl to incite her to analyze the estate? ㈡ How dare he hide my daughter in his residence upstairs? ㈢ How dare he force me to sign an acknowledgment that my daughter was marrying Shen Tongjia? ㈣ How dare he prevent me from taking my daughter back? It is evident that he colluded with Shen Tongjia to abduct and incite my young daughter in order to plot to obtain property, which is a crime under Article 258 of the criminal law. Since Shen Tongjia previously resided at the Mao Quanta timber shop on Sichuan Road in the Public Concession, he is being sued in the First Special District Court along with the lawyer. Not only does the lawyer not know repentance, but he dares to repeatedly falsely report to the Songshan Road and Lujiawan police stations that I used a gun to rob my daughter. I have been wronged. We wish China peace, prosperity, and tranquil happiness. However, we must say that China must shift its gaze from admiring the West and focus on its own greatness. Those who sow evil will reap its consequences. The way to save an individual and save a nation is not to rely on others, even if they are famous. In reality, they are empty, false, and deceitful, like the "League of Nations." Therefore, to seek salvation, one must rely on one's own knowledge, one's own strength, and one's own struggle. Regarding this point, I may have more to contribute. May China and the Chinese people be happy. May all sentient beings be happy.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Western Islamic Leaders Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>(Guo Wen News Agency) Dr. Khalid Sheldrake, President of the Western Islamic Association of London, Dr. Zhai Yide Muhammad, a famous Egyptian philosopher, and Dr. Sai Haiying Bailai, etc., arrived in Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Rosso on the fifth. I was wrongly accused. Fortunately, the Chinese and Western detectives of the police station conducted a clear investigation and found that the report was untrue. Furthermore, he dared to falsely accuse me in your court, stating that I secretly ordered two people to rob my daughter with a gun, obstructing the exercise of rights. Lai Huayin is my daughter and is underage. As the person exercising parental authority, I have a responsibility to supervise her. Moreover, she had been abducted by Shen Tongjia for many days and was only found at the lawyer's house. Naturally, I ordered her to go home. This is in accordance with both reason and law. How can it be said that she was robbed? The lawyer knew that Lai Huayin was my young daughter, and I had the right to order her to go home. Why would I need to use a gun, let alone secretly order two people to rob her with a gun, as if I were a bandit? The lawyer cited Article 318, claiming obstruction of rights. What rights does the lawyer have to insist on keeping my daughter Huayin at his house and not allowing her mother to take her back? Is there such a principle in law? The lawyer also cited Article 319 of the criminal law, claiming intimidation. I am an old, frail woman, suffering from loneliness and being bullied. How can I have the ability to intimidate others? On the contrary, I have been subjected to considerable coercion and intimidation by the lawyer, such as forcing me to sign an acknowledgment that my daughter was marrying Shen Tongjia and threatening me not to allow me to take my daughter back. I am also a legitimate businesswoman, running the Lai Tiansheng De store at 60 Fada Road for many years, and I have always been law-abiding. As a woman, I have never come into contact with guns, weapons, or ominous objects, and I would never dare to associate with the people that the lawyer claims were carrying handguns. The lawyer's false accusations are not only unreasonable but also illegal. It is because my family has property that the lawyer covets it and does not hesitate to collude with Shen Tongjia to abduct my daughter, causing her to leave the family. He also takes advantage of my daughter's youth and weak will, thinking that he can analyze the property. When the lawyer saw that I had taken my daughter back and he could not achieve his purpose, and that I had filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, he hoped to avoid criminal liability and did not hesitate to make repeated false accusations. Your court is clear and discerning and will understand this after a single hearing. Please investigate the lawyer's crimes under Articles 180 and 258 of the criminal law to uphold the law and maintain morality. I will be eternally grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court. Plaintiff: Lai Wu. August 5th, the 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Municipal Bureau of Public Works Invents Cold Solvent Oil to Improve Road Construction <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works has been actively researching and improving road surfaces in recent years. Previously, it was concerned about the winter cracking and summer melting of asphalt roads. Now, after multiple improvements, it has invented a cold solvent oil that can avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks. Xue Cixin, the head of the Bureau's Third Section, gave a detailed presentation at the National Economic Commission in Nanjing Tietangchi at 5:00 pm on the fourth, at the invitation of the Commission. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>) Improvement of Coal Ash Roads (Shanghai's roads are generally divided into three types: ㈠ Coal ash roads: after the completion of this type of road surface, it is exceptionally flat and comfortable for the first two or three weeks, but after a few months, it becomes uneven after rain. Vehicles sink deeply when passing over it, and on sunny days, dust obscures the sky. The Bureau has been researching improvements. Initially, a crushed brick base was added to avoid sinking after rain, and the result was very good. However, the dust on sunny days could not be reduced. Later, salt brine was added to the road surface, but it broke easily after heavy vehicles passed over it. Therefore, a satisfactory solution has not been found to date.</p>
<p>(Remediation of Brick and Stone Roads) ㈡ Brick and stone roads: The cost of materials and maintenance for this type of surface is very low. However, due to poor construction techniques, there is often mud after rain. Subsequent attempts to remedy this also used a crushed stone base to reduce unevenness, and the arch of the road was rebuilt using rectangular stones three inches wide and six inches long to make the road flat and solid. To reduce mud, the stone seams were initially filled with cement slurry, but this easily cracked. Later, a powder of asphalt was used to fill the seams, which was effective, but the cost was very high. Therefore, a good solution has not been found. The construction project has been changed from a contracting system to a long-term employee system to reduce the drawbacks of being careless.</p>
<p>(Invention of Cold Solvent Oil) ㈢ Crushed stone roads: The maintenance cost of this road is very high. The surface is covered with asphalt. However, it is prone to cracking in the cold winter. Later, adding asphalt was improved, but although the cracking in winter was reduced, it was easy to dissolve in the hot summer. Now, after hiring British engineering experts to conduct research, a cold solvent oil has been invented. It is a semi-solid made of asphalt and light kerosene. When building, stone chips are added and mixed with a machine, then poured on the road. Vehicles can travel on it immediately. In winter, there is no risk of cracking, and in summer, there is no worry about melting. It can be said that a great success has been achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e130">City Detective Team Cracks Down on Two Gambling Dens in Zhabei <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>| More Than Twenty Gamblers Detained | At 16 Gongxing Lane, Xinmin Road, Datong Road, Zhabei, a hoodlum from Wuxi, Dong A'gen (28 years old), colluded with Li Rongsheng, Shen Xiaoping, and other unemployed vagrants from Shaoxing to secretly establish a gambling den. All kinds of games, such as shaking Tan and Pai Gow, were available to lure ignorant men and women into the game to gamble all night, taking advantage of them to extract profits. Gamblers were stationed at both the front and back doors to prevent arrest. Unexpectedly, the gambling boss and the gamblers did not split the spoils evenly. The city police detective team member Sun Shucheng learned about this and reported the intelligence to Captain Lu Ying. He immediately dispatched stationed team members Chen Caifu and Liu Changrui, leading Yu Hanwen, Wu Songshan, Wu Zuorong, Zeng Wanli, Mao Gongzhao, and other armed detectives, to the gambling den disguised as waiters, vendors, and gamblers at about 5:00 pm last night. Just as the gamblers were shouting and cheering in high spirits, they were surrounded on all sides with a shout. The gambling bosses Dong A'gen and Xu Fusheng, as well as Li Rongsheng, Shen Xiaoping, and eight other male and female gamblers, including Fang Bingkun from Changzhou, Liu Ziqing from Hangzhou, and Ye Zhangshi and Li Chenshi from Yancheng, were arrested on the spot. A large number of gambling tools were also seized and taken back to the team along with the gambling funds. According to reports from team leaders Chen Caifu and Liu Changheng, there were several large gambling tables, and additional detectives Wu Tianxiang, Wei Feng, and Zhang Yuzhu were dispatched to the addresses to arrest the gambling boss Pan Jinchuan and eighteen gamblers, including Wang ZhengSong, Gao Faming, Tang Bingshun, and Ma Xiaolong. Two pairs of gambling tools, Sizi Bao, were also seized and taken back to the team. The suspects were transferred to the Bureau for legal action this morning.</p>

<p>Wu Bingyan, a candidate warden from E Province serving in the Second Special District Prison of the French Concession, during an inspection of all prison cells around 1 PM on the 25th of last month, found Gong Bin, a foreman warden and fellow townsman, removing his uniform hat and unbuttoning his collar while on duty in the exercise yard. Wu reprimanded him for improper etiquette, to which Gong replied that it was hot and he was wiping sweat. Wu then reported this to Warden Sun Xiong. Gong rushed to the public office to argue with Wu, and a conflict ensued. Wu allegedly threw an inkstone from the desk, hitting Gong's head and causing bleeding. Colleagues separated them, and Gong reported Wu to the Central Police Station for assault and battery. The police chief sent detectives to the prison to arrest Wu, who was transferred to the Second Special District Court the following day, and prosecuted for assault. Details of the interrogation were reported in a previous issue. Subsequently, after further hearings, the court ruled that the plaintiff, Gong Hanbin, had not presented sufficient evidence, and acquitted the defendant, Wu Bingyan. Gong, dissatisfied with the verdict, requested the police department to appeal, alleging obstruction of official duty and requesting an investigation and punishment. The prosecutor, Wang Ren, accompanied by clerk Zhao Fen, opened an investigation hearing in the Fifth Tribunal the day before yesterday, summoning the plaintiff Wu Bingyan and three warden witnesses to the court for questioning. After an hour, the judge adjourned the hearing pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Flower Association Raided in Zhoujia Bridge <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Tan, the district head of the Sixth District in Caojiadu, west of Shanghai, discovered that flower associations had recently become prevalent in the area, secretly establishing "listening tube" gambling dens to lure people into gambling and collect money for profit. Despite repeated orders to his subordinates to conduct thorough investigations and arrests, the mobile nature of these operations made it difficult to eradicate them quickly. Wei, the patrol officer of the Zhoujia Bridge Sixth District Substation, learned yesterday that a large illegal flower association "listening tube" operation was located at No. 59, Zhoujia Bridge Lane. He immediately led all patrol officers and police to the address, where they found people in the act of collecting gambling money. They arrested the principal offender, Yao Yingshi (a local), along with his wife, Yao Jinshi, Yao Shenshi, associates Yao Guanbao, Yao Linsheng, and gamblers Gu Fusheng, Zhu Abao, Wang Awu, Xu Dayuan, Li Yun, Zhu Ziqi, and eleven others. They also seized six gambling ledgers, dozens of flower association slips, several silver dollars, and gambling tools such as abacuses and number charts. All were taken to the Sixth District for questioning by District Head Tan. After verifying the facts, Tan prepared a report and transferred them to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment.</p>

<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Wang Buxian is the principal of Yuqun Middle School, a private school in Jiangwan. The school employed an electrician named Jiang Akang, 23 years old, from Wuxi. At around 6 PM the night before last, the school's flagpole light was damaged. Jiang went up to repair it. As he was about to begin working, the wire's rubber insulation had deteriorated due to prolonged exposure to wind, rain, and sun. Jiang inadvertently touched it and was electrocuted, falling to the ground and losing consciousness instantly, dying shortly thereafter. Principal Wang Buxian reported the incident to the Fifth Precinct, Fifth Station of Jiangwan. The precinct sent a patrol officer to investigate and report to the Bureau Chief, while also instructing the local headman to report the matter to the local court, which then appointed a prosecutor to examine the body.</p>

<p>Huang Fuyuan, a carpenter from Dengyanghang, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was 34 years old. Huang was lazy and often stopped working, making it difficult to support himself. Five years ago, his wife, unable to endure hunger and cold, ran away with her lover. After his wife left, Huang did not improve, continuing his idle ways. Unable to find consistent work or even a full meal, he relied on his brother, Huang Linyuan, for sustenance. Eventually, he felt ashamed and resentful of the criticism, so he bought two bottles of sleeping medication and consumed them in his room the night before last. The next day, his brother, wondering why Huang Fuyuan had not risen, entered the room and found him dead. Shocked, he reported to the Third District, Fourth Station, which dispatched police to the scene. Two empty medicine bottles were found, confirming suicide. The police instructed the local headman to report the death to the local court for investigation. Prosecutor Zhang and others arrived at the scene to examine the body and ordered it to be prepared for burial, pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Xu Duckling Granted Probation for Theft <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Chen Amao, a rickshaw puller from Yangzhou residing at No. 1199, Wuzhou Road, and his wife Xu Duckling, 36 years old, separated in November 1931. Chen Amao had moved his mistress, Fan Lishi, into their home, and Xu Duckling became jealous. Their relationship deteriorated, and the couple quarreled often before Duckling disappeared. Chen Amao hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file two lawsuits in the First Special District Court: one accusing her of absconding with property and the other seeking a divorce. Xu Duckling failed to appear at the initial hearings for both cases. At 9 AM on May 7 of last year, Xu Duckling, along with several others, broke into Chen Amao's home while he was away and made off with two trunks of clothing and a foreign stove, worth 100 yuan. Chen returned home and, discovering the missing items, reported the theft to the police, accusing Xu Duckling and her accomplices of robbery and requesting their arrest. Over a year later, on July 21 of this year, Chinese and Western detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station apprehended Xu Duckling in the Chinese area along with a suspect, Wang Tianbao, also from Yangzhou. After investigation, it was determined that Wang (her lover) was not involved in the theft, and he was released. Xu Duckling admitted to taking the trunks, claiming they were her own possessions and that she had been driven away by Chen Amao and his mistress, Fan Lishi. She denied running away and claimed to be unaware of the divorce proceedings. Lawyer Huang Xiubo was summoned, but he could not prove the divorce. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation. The day before yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the hearing in the Third Criminal Court, stating that Chen Amao's divorce suit against Xu Duckling was a default judgment served by public notice. He questioned both plaintiffs and defendants at length, and their testimonies remained as before. Lawyer Jiang Heli represented Xu Duckling and requested leniency, arguing that she was a woman who did not read newspapers and was unaware of the public notice of divorce. The court sentenced Xu Duckling to one year of imprisonment, suspended for three years, for the crime of "theft by three or more persons."</p>

<p>The wife of Chen Kengran, a prominent figure in the film industry, is Ms. Songfen, the daughter of Shanghai notable Mr. Pan Songqu. They have been married for over a decade. Their marriage was arranged by Mr. Lu Shaotang, a major real estate magnate in Shanghai. Due to business relations, Chen has had an affair with a certain actress for several years, and they are as close as husband and wife. Ms. Pan has repeatedly protested, and Chen's father has solemnly declared that his son will never be allowed to marry the actress. Recently, Chen's father suddenly passed away. The actress intends to seize this opportunity to join the family and perform mourning rites. Ms. Pan fears that if she enters the family, she will usurp her position. To clarify her status, she insists that the actress perform the rituals of a concubine upon entering the family, which the actress refuses because she has children with Chen. Ms. Pan, seeking legal protection, has hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao to issue a statement in the newspapers to clarify the situation.</p>

<p>Zhou Laosan, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 19, Jinderi, Rue du Père Froc, in the French Concession, arranged the marriage for her adopted daughter. On the 22nd of last month, the girl was abducted by a street vendor and hidden in Room 5 of the Ruihe Hotel at No. 135, Rue Macao. Xu Kaishao, a detective of the French Police Station, inspected the room, found the girl inside, and suspected foul play. After questioning, he learned that she had been abducted and was being sold. He brought the girl to the police station and arrested Lin and Zhou. The police station's lawyer prosecuted them under Article 257 of the Criminal Code. Details of the interrogation were reported in a previous issue. The trial has now concluded. Judge Li Changnian sentenced Lin Debiao and Zhou Laosan to eight months of imprisonment each, suspended for two years, for the crime of abducting a girl under the age of twenty with the intention of profiting. The sales contract was confiscated. The girl, Jin Gendou, also known as Wang Juzhen, was temporarily sent to the Xin Puyu Hall for foster care. The defendants posted bail during the appeal period. If they do not pay bail, they will be temporarily held in detention.</p>

<p>An elderly woman named Chen Dai, from Yancheng, over 40 years old, lived with her lover, Lu Jincheng, in a thatched shed at a certain address in Yuque Port, Rihui Bridge, Nanshi. Their relationship was very close and they acted like husband and wife. Chen Dai had a son from a previous marriage, Chen Chaoju, who was in his early twenties and raised by Lu Jincheng. Last night, Chen and Lu had an argument over household matters. Lu went out to cool off. When he returned home around 3 AM the next morning, he saw Chen had hanged herself in the living room. There were obvious red marks on her neck, but no rope was visible. He quickly took her down and fled. Neighbors discovered the body around 6 AM and reported it to the Second District Public Security Bureau, which then instructed the local headman to report it to the court for examination. The authorities are investigating and searching for the lover, Lu Jincheng.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo joint transport plan, including exemption from baggage inspection, between the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau and the Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Sanbei shipping companies, is under discussion. The Ningbo Public Security Bureau replied to the Railway Bureau yesterday, stating that it is difficult to completely exempt checked baggage from inspection because it involves changing established procedures. The bureau requested that the Railway Bureau directly contact the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct the local bureau to follow the new procedures. After receiving the letter, the Railway Bureau has already contacted the Zhejiang Provincial Government to handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Hongqiao Town Merchants Petition the Municipal Government to Dredge the River <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai West Puhui Tang River was contracted out in sections for dredging by the Public Works Bureau, the first two sections have been completed after more than four months. However, the fourth and fifth sections from Hongqiao Town to Jiepai Bridge were contracted to Shen Rongji. Due to prolonged work stoppages, the depth and width of the channel differ greatly from the original dimensions. As the deadline set by the Public Works Bureau is approaching, the contractor has reduced the amount of earth removed and piled the silt from the riverbed onto the banks. This will inevitably wash back into the river during rains. Furthermore, the contractor has reportedly submitted a request to superiors for acceptance and inspection. Consequently, shops throughout Hongqiao Town are opposing this. They have requested Pan Boxian, a member of the town's river dredging committee, to petition the Municipal Government to order the Public Works Bureau to demolish all the sheds built along the banks, rebuild the river to the defined width of six zhang, and re-dredge the river. Meanwhile, more than 40 shops, including Yilong, Yuanlong, Tongchang, Yimao, Fuji, Zhongdetang, Santai, Yichang, and Chengji, have jointly petitioned the Public Works Bureau to order the contractor, Shen Rongji, to dredge the river in accordance with the defined depth, width, and dimensions, and not to reduce the amount of earth removed, in order to benefit navigation and complete the project.</p>

<p>The Railway Bureau requested the capital to temporarily suspend inspections. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau received a report from the Capital Summer Epidemic Prevention Joint Office that genuine cholera had been discovered in Suzhou and planned to send personnel to inspect passengers arriving at the Beijing-Shanghai train stations to prevent the spread. The bureau immediately instructed the health department to discuss and respond. The report stated that the Central Cholera Bureau held a meeting in Shanghai, which the department chief also attended. At the meeting, the committee members carefully examined reports from various locations. From Shanghai to Suzhou and Nanjing, no genuine cholera was discovered. The bureau reported that the report from Suzhou claimed to have discovered genuine cholera. However, this report was also submitted for review at the Central Cholera Bureau meeting and was deemed insufficient to confirm the discovery of genuine cholera. Furthermore, more than a thousand passengers travel by small boat and private ship from Suzhou to Nanjing every week. If the waterways are not inspected, inspecting only train stations will inconvenience passengers traveling north to Beijing and Shanghai. Based on the above reasons, the bureau should request the Capital Summer Epidemic Prevention Joint Office to temporarily suspend inspections at Xiaguan Station. When genuine cholera is confirmed, the bureau will send a doctor to assist in the process. The bureau believed that these facts were accurate and formally replied to the Capital Summer Epidemic Prevention Joint Office to request a temporary suspension of the inspections.</p>

<p>The second-hand clothing workers previously signed a 16-year agreement. The clothing industry association notified the store on July 5 that they should uniformly fulfill their agreement and treat it with good faith. However, there was recently a labor dispute between Nanshi Dingyuan and the employer. The clothing industry association’s workers maintaining conditions committee negotiated a solution. The parties went to the local court to file a counter-suit. The employer of Tian Tian on Fujian Road disregards humanity and opposes eating during a standstill. This was resolved through negotiations. They also formed a union with Chunhua Changlongji to break the conditions with three companies. They made false accusations to various agencies, which angered the workers. They collectively stated that the employer's actions are not in line with modern social conditions. On the 4th, they sent 60 representatives from various districts to petition the Municipal Party Department. After describing the facts and the current situation, Zhao Jun received them. Six representatives said that the 16-year agreement should not be broken under the law. If there is any breach, they will mediate between the workers and the employers in the name of maintaining conditions based on the facts. The representatives left satisfied.</p>

It is reported that the workers in the factory are working day and night to produce, and there is a great demand for it.

<h3 id="e153">On Eyes <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Nineteen</p>
<p>From the lines "The eye has the same view of colors, and one view is the same" and "Heaven sees as the people see, and seeing is one," we can deduce that heaven gave people a pair of eyes in order to unify their vision. However, due to the changes in color and the complexity of events, like treacherous waves and unpredictable clouds, it is impossible to grasp; as a result, people see things differently according to their own perspectives and wisdom. Although this can be said to be the art of the eye, it has lost the original intention of heaven giving people eyes.</p>
<p>For example, "Xi Shi" must come from the eyes of a "lover." It seems that if one is not a "lover," "Xi Shi" will not appear in their eyes. When dominoes click, the eyes will feel cool. Now that the West is gradually influencing China, it is said that foreigners have also started playing mahjong. This shows that dominoes do have the effect of cooling the eyes. The above two examples are about the amazing things about the eyes, which everyone knows. People see things differently according to their own perspectives and wisdom. In other words, everyone's views are different. "Play mahjong, national affairs, screw them." This is also a point of view. If 400 million compatriots could all see it this way, the nation's vision could be unified. "Internal pacification and external resistance" once caused a great uproar. This is also because the views of the upper and lower levels are different. Furthermore, adversity can build a nation. However, the words "national crisis" are now rarely seen even in the newspapers. Presumably, weapons of war have been transformed into jade and silk, and the world can be peaceful from now on. This is another difference in viewpoints. Jiao Da in the Dream of the Red Chamber saw that the pair of stone lions in front of the Jia Mansion were clean. Regardless of whether the view is correct or not, it is not easy for a rude man to see the small details.</p>
<p>In short, the eye is indeed a very mysterious thing. It is impossible for heaven to unify the vision of ordinary people. "Heaven sees" is the same as "the people see." The "people see" are so different, I wonder what the "heaven sees" is like. How can we call out to heaven and ask?</p>
<h3 id="e154">Automobiles Rampant in the Interior <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— A Stiffened Chrysalis</p>
<p>"The road is like a tiger; one must not walk in the middle of it." In bustling cities, cars roar, galloping around like fierce tigers. One moment of carelessness, and the blood of the common people, crushed by the car's wheels, immediately splatters, painting the road a dazzling red. Cars are a necessity for the wealthy to get around—fast, stable, and authentically foreign. As a result, officials, scholars, compradors, the rich, fashionable women, and modern young masters abound. Such figures must ride in a car to demonstrate their nobility. Just look at Nanjing Road, from morning till night, endlessly winding like two celestial poisonous dragons, and you can see how alarmingly popular cars have become.</p>
<p>Shanghai is, after all, the Paris of the East. Although the blood of commoners splatters on the roads on average several times a day, the rich can resolve everything by simply pulling out their wallets. After all, commoners are an overabundant commodity in Shanghai. The more commoners' blood is shed, the higher the value of the rich becomes, and the more civilized the metropolis appears.</p>
<p>Cars are indeed the most urgently needed tool for transportation. As a result, everywhere in the interior feels the need. Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangzhou...one place after another has discovered this most modern and stable mode of transportation, galloping swiftly and reliably on several expanded roads.</p>
<p>Although Suzhou is a cultural land with the quintessential characteristics of antiquity, after the expansion of Guanqian Street, Hulong Street, and Jingde Road, it already possesses the rudimentary form of Shanghai's roads. The newly emerging ancient city requires cars as the most modern embellishment. Consequently, a group of Suzhou celebrities jointly submitted a petition to the county government, requesting permission to allow cars to operate in order to revitalize the market, facilitate transportation, and aid commerce. How important! This modern request. Especially during this sweltering season for cruising around.</p>
<p>The blood of commoners, crushed by cars, paints the road with color, and the people of the interior can also broaden their horizons.</p>

<p>Crimped hair and electric lights are originally as unrelated as a horse and an ox, but now I am writing about the two issues together... In Shanghai, Ford, Citroen, and pointy-tailed Austins bounce along the asphalt roads. The windows of opulent hotels are like lewd eyes.</p>

<h3 id="e156">From Watermelon Season to Rural Economic Panic <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Watermelon is originally a summer refreshment. The ancients said it well... "Floating watermelon and sinking plums." In the past, watermelons were indeed a summer drink, but they have been degenerating year after year. Because in the city, there are many other things to relieve the heat, such as ice cream, sour plum juice, and tangerine and fruit syrups. Why must one eat watermelon? As a result, watermelon has become a refreshing fruit for middle and lower-class families.</p>
<p>This year's watermelons in the Suzhou area are at most only about two yuan, and in the past few days, the price has dropped a lot, only costing a little over one yuan per dan (a unit of weight). How much profit can the villagers make from a watermelon costing a little over one yuan per dan? And sometimes, they can't even sell them, still arriving full of boats and returning full of boats. If rural by-products cannot be sold smoothly, then a rural economic panic will surely occur. Therefore, seeing watermelons come to market makes me feel the rural economic panic. This is a fact placed before us, and there is no denying it.</p>
<p>From the fact that watermelons cannot be sold smoothly, we can talk about the inability of national silk to develop. Because ice cream and tangerine juice are like wool and serge transported from Europe and America, while watermelon is like domestically produced silk. In other words, silk cannot be developed, just as watermelon cannot be sold smoothly. We must defeat ice cream and tangerine juice so that watermelons can be sold smoothly and so that the rural economy is not completely hopeless, with a glimmer of dawn.

<h3 id="e157">Northeast Fourth Company Commander <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve. The poor and lowly suffer hardship when they join the army; a sick man falls behind and sacrifices himself; willingly doffing his uniform, the amorous warrior Zhao Ziqiang takes off his military hat with his left hand and strokes his head several times with his right, smiling, "That's a long story." Saying this, he takes out his pocket watch and glances at it, already without time to allow him to speak further, and stands up, saying, "Let's talk next time I come back." Miss Jiang thinks to herself, this company commander, for no reason, ran over to sit for a while, only saying he wants to change his profession. Whether you change your profession or not, what are you telling us for? Could it be that he knows what I mean, unwilling to have a soldier as a son-in-law, so he wants to change his profession? That would be really something! Thinking this, she also smiles. Zhao Ziqiang thinks, as soon as he says he wants to change his profession, his future wife smiles, and his future mother-in-law also smiles. Looking at it this way, the profession truly cannot but be changed. With such a dumb riddle in his stomach, he walks with his head lowered, all the way thinking about returning to the camp. Walking on the road, hearing the bugle sound, seeing the white buildings of Xiyuan, and even the gray uniform on his body, he feels that nothing is not old-fashioned to the point of annoyance. If he doesn't change his profession and gets married, one person will be at home, and the other will be in the camp. Not to mention that it would be wasting his wife's youth, why did he marry a wife in the first place? If he changes his profession, no matter what he does, the two of them can always be together. No wonder some girls don't want to marry soldiers; marrying a person is just an empty name, truly being a "grass widow"! The more he thinks, the more he agrees, and he must change his profession! Now is not some urgent time, so resigning his post should be possible. For the sake of love, he will sacrifice this company commander position and resign tomorrow. Thinking this, he returns to the company headquarters, no longer having any hesitation, and wants to approach that sergeant to discuss how to request his resignation. As for what he usually thinks about, such as resisting Japan and serving the country, he has not a bit of it in his mind. Here, we can see how he goes to find his new life. (151)</p>
<h3 id="e158">Inside the Detention Center <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Tiger Head</p>
<p>The source of the facts is as follows... I have a friend who was detained in a detention center for two days and nights on suspicion of murder. Based on what he told me about fragments of news from inside the detention center, I am now recording these words below, which can also be considered a timely article under Mr. Dong Shoujing's plea for prisoners. (The following are my friend's words)</p>
<p>The police accidentally killed the old quartermaster in my shop while cleaning their guns. At the time, I planned to have the police pay some money as funeral expenses for the old quartermaster; and I would also add some compensation as relief funds for the bereaved family. It seemed like it could pass peacefully? Who knew that at this time, someone would come out using bamboo-splitting methods to make me spend more money? Tell me, who would want to do that? The reason I was willing to spend some money on relief was because he was an old member of the shop, and it was unfortunate that the quartermaster died, so compensating some money was to comfort the heart and did not mean I had to take on any responsibility. I frankly refused. They then framed me with "trumped-up" charges and put me in jail. This was two weeks ago. The place I was detained in was Detention Center No. 14. It was only a small room about five feet wide and less than two zhang (approximately 20 feet) long. Above the room was a small hole like a ventilation window, fitted with iron bars. The hole was for the prisoners to breathe, and the iron bars were to prevent jailbreaks. Inside the small room, there were already fifteen or sixteen people, with long gowns, short jackets, all kinds of people. The exit was only a small door that could barely be passed by sideways. A wooden bucket was placed in the corner inside the door, where people urinated and defecated. Now that it's summer, the room is small and crowded, and the stench is overwhelming and unbearable! But these people have been here for many days and are just like "being in a shop selling abalone, and not smelling the stench after a long time." They seemed to be at ease! These fifteen or sixteen people, distinguished by the types of crimes they committed, were indeed diverse and interesting to see! Communists, opium addicts, red pill users, flower society members, adulterers, drunkards and fighters... all kinds of people; someone like me, suspected of murder, was probably the only one! Among them, the most common were those who committed adultery. No wonder stories of rape and seduction can often be found in social news. Shanghai is truly a world of lust! This detention center also provided food every day. The daytime was almost evenly divided to provide two meals, so when eating, I felt there was a big difference compared to normal times. This kind of food, if you called it rice, had a lot of water, and you could hardly tell it was rice. If you called it porridge, you couldn't see your face reflected in the many waters, so it didn't seem like you could call it porridge. As for the color of the rice... it was neither black nor white, roughly between black and white, and it was very unpleasant to look at. The vegetable was a light cabbage soup. How could anyone swallow it? Fortunately, I was only detained for two days and nights and was able to endure the hunger and not eat it. If it had been extended for a few more days, I would have had to learn from Mr. Gandhi and go on a hunger strike. Opium, cigarettes, and matches were also supplied here. These were originally things that prisoners did not need, so they were priced very high. Each opium bubble cost at least two big yuan. I didn't see any whole cigarettes. The so-called cigarette butts that one wouldn't normally smoke cost thirty copper coins each. Each match cost fifty wen. Therefore, smoking a cigarette butt cost 350 wen, and if you were unlucky enough to be detected by the inspectors, you would also be subjected to increased punishment. For example, when A and B were smoking a cigarette butt together, when A smoked, B would fan it, and when B smoked, A would fan it. This fanning was not because it was hot in the summer, but to fan out the smell of the cigarette to avoid being punished again. Opium bubbles were the most difficult to pass around. It is said that entrusting the food deliveryman was the most reliable, because when the food deliveryman delivered the food, the prison door was open, and he had to hide it in the bottom of the bowl and secretly transport it. Although the plan was meticulous, it was also extremely painstaking. Pancakes and fried dough sticks were originally the food that poor friends used to fill their stomachs, so their price was the same as outside. Eating vegetables seemed to have a bit of an aristocratic color, so the fees were higher. It was still a fair arrangement?</p>
<p>My friend was talking to this point when someone called him to answer the phone, so the conversation was interrupted.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Kunming long-distance running event organized by the Chinese Sports Association held a practice run yesterday morning, using the Shanghai-Songhu section as the basis. The start was originally scheduled for 4:30 AM, but due to incomplete team members, it was delayed until 5:00 AM. Starting from the Songhu Railway Station on Baoshan Road, heading north, passing the Commercial Press to Tiantong Nunnery, entering Jiangwan Road, turning into the West Sports Association Road, crossing the racecourse to Jiangwan Station, following the railway to Zhanghuabang Station, then turning into Jungong Road, crossing Wuncaobang Bridge, returning to the railway, along Wusong Town to Paotaiwan, a total distance of 11 and 3/4 miles. Li Yagu, a member of the Baihong team, guided everything along the way. At the beginning, Zheng Renan took the lead, followed by Sun Qixing, with Gong Bangfu and Zhu Yunfu competing for third and fourth place. At Wuncaobang, Zhu took third place, and Gong gradually fell behind. The final results were: 1st Zheng Renan, 2nd Sun Qixing, 3rd Zhu Xuefu, 4th Gong Bangfu, reaching the finish line in 1 hour, 18 minutes, and 50 seconds. If there are no problems, the association's Shanghai-Kunming long-distance race will be held on the 20th of this month, and non-members are welcome to participate.

<p>This session has begun, and due to illness among some players, many matches have been postponed for make-up games. However, there are also cases of players not showing up without prior notice, causing their opponents to wait in vain. This is difficult to reconcile with the spirit of sportsmanship. It is hoped that in the future, if one is unable to participate, please notify in advance so that the opponent can be informed. In last Friday's match, Tu Kaiyuan did not show up, leaving only Shen Baigui and Chen Chuanzhang in one group. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>Xian Fang Cup Tennis Match Highlight: Wang Wenzheng Wins Three Straight Sets Against Guo Qida. The match between Railway and Green Light yesterday was one of the highlights of this year's Xian Fang Cup Tennis League. In the end, Railway, with its well-rounded team, won 9-6. Wang Wenzheng won three straight sets against Guo Qida, showing great momentum. From now on, Wang will likely win the Little Champagne Silver Cup award for first singles. Furthermore, Wang and Qian Wenbao's victory over Guo Qida and Chen Naixin in the first doubles match by a score of 2-1 was also commendable. Although Railway's victory was a late one, it still had no impact. However, You You must be wary of their lurking threat, ready to seize their position and sing a triumphant song.</p>

<p>Professor Zhang Qiyun of Central University Speaks on Tzu Tao's Notes. Professor Zhang Qiyun of Central University is an expert in Chinese geography and history, and his various history and geography books are popular. Currently, Mr. Zhang is also a member of the Central National Defense Commission and has thoroughly researched national defense education. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, recognizing that national defense is the foundation of a country and that national defense education is particularly urgent, invited Mr. Zhang to give a special lecture at the summer school of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education. At first, Mr. Zhang declined repeatedly due to his work on the National Defense Commission, but after repeated letters of invitation from Hu Changcai, the section chief of the Bureau of Education, he finally agreed to come to Shanghai and give four lectures a day. The topics and content of his lectures are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e199">First Lecture: Discussing National Defense Education from the Perspective of National Defense Concepts <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 and the Boxer Rebellion, China has faced severe national crises and deep pain. People of insight have gradually begun to promote military-national education through speech and writing. Among the representative figures is Mr. Jiang Baili. Mr. Jiang proposed three methods for the military and schools to cooperate: (1) Elementary schools should practice small team drills. (2) Middle schools and normal schools should practice medium-sized team training. (3) Higher schools and higher normal schools should practice large team training. Higher education should pay particular attention to military systems, strategies, and key national defense tasks. In terms of spiritual training, Mr. Jiang advocated diligence, hardship, and strength to cultivate the nation's foundation, and to inspire the nation's spirit with literature and art. Therefore, when Chinese people ask about national defense education,</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang should be regarded as the most outstanding.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, the purpose of education was announced: "Focus on moral education, supplemented by practical education and military-national education, and complete it with aesthetic education." However, if we look back at the atmosphere of the early Republic of China, the so-called military-national education was nothing more than a formality and had little practical effect. This is something we have all experienced. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, an educational survey was held in Beijing, with Fan Yuanlian, Cai Yuanpei, Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingheng, and others participating. At this time, the European War had ended, and the world was advocating peace. The educational survey proposed to abolish militarist democracy and replace it with "cultivating sound personality and developing national spirit" as the purpose. This proposal was adopted and promulgated by the Ministry of Education. We do not wish to criticize the views of these gentlemen. National character should be based on sound personality, and national defense should be based on national spirit. Theoretically, there is nothing wrong with this, but in reality, it is still too abstract and lacks specific and effective measures.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government, the Three Principles of the People were clearly defined as the purpose of moral education. Originally, the Prime Minister's teachings contained profound national defense considerations in every aspect. However, there are not many people who can develop the Prime Minister's legacy. To be honest, in recent years, it has been like "buying a casket and returning the pearl." The Prime Minister's industrial plan is like the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, and at its core is a national defense plan. Its purpose is to mechanize the military. Unfortunately, in recent years, this legacy has often been shelved and few people have asked about it. Looking at the first part of the industrial plan, the Prime Minister tells us to designate Duolun as the main base for immigration policy, to station more than one million demobilized troops near Duolun, to build a double-track railway from Duolun to the northern major port, and to invite military experts to guide the immigration movement. There are also many very detailed and thoughtful plans. Not to mention that people in the government almost ignored the Duolun policy, how many people in schools are willing to pay attention to and study it? Recently, the word Duolun has been making headlines in newspapers, but it is already too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's biggest problem is that they steal empty names to amuse themselves. They learn a few slogans and think they have fulfilled their responsibility. So, whether it is military-national education, moral education, personality education, Three Principles of the People education, or the newest national defense education, the cyclical replacement of these terms cannot save China. We need careful theories, detailed articles, not only practical plans, but also serious implementation. Having said that, ordinary people still have a superficial understanding of the word "national defense" and do not understand the whole picture. They ultimately believe that national defense is the military, and the military is raising soldiers. Putting on a military uniform and carrying a gun makes one a military national. That is truly losing the mark by a mile. Our country raises the most soldiers, accounting for the first place in the world. According to recent statistics, the combined standing armies of the five powerful countries of Britain, the United States, France, Russia, and Japan are only 1.5 million people. China has 1.8 million standing troops and 700,000 miscellaneous troops, totaling 2.5 million people. If that is the case, wouldn't China be</p>
<p>the strongest country in the world?</p>
<p>I once gave a speech intended to correct the common misconception of national defense, roughly meaning that national defense (1) is not the military's national defense, but the people's national defense; (2) is not a national defense for dying, but a national defense for maintaining life; (3) is not a defensive national defense, but an offensive national defense; (4) not only focuses on tangible national defense, but also pays attention to intangible national defense. The Chinese army is called the National Revolutionary Army. The meaning of the National Army is the people's army, that is, the new national defense should take the entire people as the source. In theory, the focus of China's national defense is not on a small number of frontline soldiers, but on the entire national army, and even more so on the entire population. The entire Chinese territory should be like a standing military camp, and the entire population should be like a standing military force. The right to protect China should be shared by all the people. The true nature of national defense should be that the entire people are engaged in it. However, in reality, it is greatly disappointing. The people and the military can be said to have no connection, each not interfering with the other, divided into two sectors. The majority of the people, who are connected to the fate of the country, are merely spectators, leaving a small number of people to resolve their fate. The people regard military affairs as the monopoly of the military and do not interfere, and the military also regards military affairs as its monopoly and does not want people to interfere. Alas, with this to face a powerful enemy, how can there not be a great defeat?</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Discussion of Jiao Yitang's Letter to the Nation Regarding the Implementation of National Medicine Regulations <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao is a legislator in our China, and also the head of the National Medicine Hall. Regarding the National Medicine Regulations case at the Central Political Conference on June 7th, he published a letter to the nation, spanning nearly ten thousand words. After reading it, I was truly perplexed. Now, I would like to discuss my doubts with Mr. Jiao and the nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said, "Since Western medicine was introduced to our China, in order to avoid confusion with Western medicine, the term 'National Medicine' was specifically put forward as the main body. This is similar to how our Chinese writing originally had no need to be called 'National Language,' but because different languages such as English, German, and Japanese were discovered, it became extremely necessary to put forward the term 'National Language' as the main body. The meaning of National Medicine is the same." I find this argument to be illogical. Medicine is a natural science, while writing is an artificial symbol. How can they be compared? When it comes to the origin of writing, there are, of course, bases such as pictographs, ideographs, and phonetic loans. However, later on, ancient scripts evolved into seal scripts, then clerical scripts, and finally the current standard scripts. The current clerical script focuses solely on convenience for daily use, and the principles of pictographs, etc., have been abandoned. I ask, what pictographic basis is there in the current way of writing the characters for "sun" and "moon"? However, ordinary people all know that the sun is the sun and the moon is the moon, and there is no need to explain it using principles of images. Moreover, if the ancient or seal script versions of the characters for "sun" and "moon" are presented, they might be turned upside down and become unrecognizable. This shows that writing is entirely a national custom, an artificial symbol that is forcibly made. I can say that calling heaven "earth" or a deer a "horse" is in no way restricted by truth or reality. However, when discussing medicine, it is absolutely impossible to fabricate things arbitrarily. Yu Lichu's "Classified Drafts" states that Chinese people have seven orifices in their hearts, while Westerners have four, and that Chinese people have two testicles, while Westerners have four. This is ultimately the ravings of a madman. Liu Wansu, Li Dongyuan, Zhu Danxi, and their ilk said that stroke is caused by fire, qi, or phlegm, but it is ultimately a cerebral hemorrhage. As a result, their methods of treating stroke are said to treat fire, qi, or phlegm, but they ultimately do not treat fire, qi, or phlegm. The medicines they use to treat stroke are said to be for treating fire, qi, or phlegm, but they ultimately do not have the effects of treating fire, qi, or phlegm. In short, they are completely inconsistent with truth and reality. In other words, they are completely groundless nonsense. How can this become an academic discipline? Therefore, writing follows custom and can vary from country to country. Medicine is based on truth and has no room for differences. To put it simply, English, German, Japanese, and Chinese can have different languages, but English, German, Japanese, and National medicine cannot be established academically. I ask Mr. Jiao and the nation to distinguish this clearly first. Mr. Jiao said, "Originally, academics have no national boundaries, so there is no so-called National or Western medicine... Only those that are truly beneficial to people in the world should be promoted... People who study medicine should delve into theoretical research." I agree with this wholeheartedly. But I do not know why Mr. Jiao still wants to put forward the term "National Medicine" to avoid confusion with Western medicine. This is the first thing I ask Mr. Jiao to explain. My second request is that Mr. Jiao not forget his own great advocacy of the scholarly attitude of "delving into theoretical research," and I also ask the nation to keep it in mind as a witness.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said, "However, domestic medical circles have shown very little academic research, and business competition is becoming increasingly fierce. It is either Western medicine attacking National medicine, or National medicine discrediting Western medicine..." I want to ask Mr. Jiao, which writings of Western medicine attacking National medicine are not academic research, and which are business competition? Which declarations of National medicine discrediting Western medicine are academic research, and which are not business competition? Please examine impartially, weigh the evidence, and make a statistical analysis. I can boldly say that our attacks on National medicine are entirely academic research, while National medicine's discrediting of us is entirely business competition, because National medicine has no academic basis, only business.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said, "The state's promotion of medicine and society's support of doctors are like fathers and elder brothers supporting their younger siblings and nannies breastfeeding infants. Their love and care can be said to be meticulous. If doctors do not repay this with academic achievements and instead bicker over the distinction between Chinese and Western factions, how can the state and society place their hopes on domestic medical professionals?" I want to rephrase this and say that the people's expectations of the Legislative Yuan and their support of Mr. Jiao are like younger siblings respecting their fathers and elder brothers and infants yearning for their nannies. Their sincerity of love and respect can be said to be meticulous. If Mr. Jiao does not correct the trend in academic research and instead, as the head of the National Medicine Hall, sophistically argues to compete for dominance, even at the expense of disrupting the education system and seizing administrative power, how can he face the people?</p>
<h3 id="e201">The National Medicine Hall's Desire to Divide Political Power is No Different From Establishing Another Government <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Those of us who have read history feel that the feudal lords of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty who revered the royal court and the military commissioners of the prosperous Tang Dynasty who specialized in wielding power were examples of dividing political power and destroying the entire national organization. Recently, at the end of the declining Qing Dynasty, the governors and viceroys of the provinces monopolized power, leading to the collapse of the imperial court. However, the monarchical system had not yet been replaced, and the minds of a group of people still held the dignity of an emperor, not daring to openly rebel in order to avoid the crime of treason. Therefore, although the facts were that the tail was wagging the dog, all appointments and removals still had to obey a central imperial order. After the founding of the Republic of China, warlords and politicians, who advertised republicanism and equality, acted arbitrarily. They had eliminated the human faith in their minds and had no concept of the entire country in their eyes. Those with real power only needed to increase the number of guns, and those in positions could say whatever they wanted. Today, it was one political view, and tomorrow, it was another territory. For more than ten years, our people have been in a state of deep water and scorching fire. The National Government is trusted by everyone to be able to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and Five-Power Constitution, and to establish an organized, hopeful, and greatly developed country that can stand on its own and become strong. However, within it, political views are still incompatible, and military forces each hold their own territory. Some harshly criticize that the central government's decrees are not as extensive as Sun Chuanfang's era, which covered five provinces. What painful words these are! Let's put aside this nonsense for now. However, the sudden political upheavals and the phenomenon of dividing political power in various places after the establishment of the National Government have already been seen more than once. What has not yet been erased from our minds are the various actions of Wuhan, Northeast, Northwest, South, and Southwest, either openly forming separate governments or secretly seizing political power. I think that those officials currently serving under the banner of the central government should also have a sense of heartache. The first thing they have forgotten is the entire country. The second thing is that they are blinded by fame and fortune. The third thing is that they are surrounded by a group of politicians and have lost their direction. Therefore, they each have their own ideas, each has their own actions, each protects their own territory, and each expands their own power, creating a seemingly united but internally divided phenomenon. No wonder the Japanese repeatedly say at the League of Nations that we are an unorganized country. If you carefully interpret this criticism, isn't it saying that it's just a gathering of a chaotic mix of people who are like a bunch of drunkards and meat-eating brothers? Don't you think it's shameful? In the current central government, I firmly believe that there are quite a few people who have been abroad for a long time and have a clear understanding of the situation. However, it is inevitable that some people are swayed by others or have deeply ingrained habits. There are also those who know the broad road but occasionally get lost, and even those who use personal likes and dislikes as tools for political struggle. As a result, government orders have no target, and construction is difficult to progress. The establishment of the Central National Medicine Hall has already made us feel that there are strange rocks on the horizon. However, because it is an academic institution, and academic freedom of research is not prohibited in any country. Moreover, academics, especially practical subjects, not only rely on oral and written records, but also need to focus on materials and provide evidence. Therefore, successful research is an achievement, and without achievement, it is as if it does not exist. Let it be. Unexpectedly, recently, many important figures in the central government, I don't know what wire they suddenly touched, temporarily forgetting the national administrative organization and the consistent system of academics, and in a chaotic manner, wanted to give the Central National Medicine Hall, which has no basis, full political and academic power. They did not think that political power cannot be easily divided and that government orders cannot be arbitrarily given to others. They also did not think that within the Ministry of Education, which manages national culture, they could divide a portion of its political power and hand it over to the Central National Medicine Hall, which has no legal status. They also did not think that within the Ministry of Interior, which manages national civil affairs, they could divide a portion of its political power and hand it over to the Central National Medicine Hall, which has no legal status. Alas, what kind of national system is this? What kind of unified political and legal system is this? Isn't this the same as the separate establishment of governments and the expansion of their own labor force in Wuhan, Northeast, Northwest, South, and Southwest in the past? I would also like to ask the officials who proposed this: if this proposal is passed in the Legislative Yuan, will this group of Chinese medicine practitioners not be under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, which governs the national politics of the central government, and will they not all become foreigners in our country? Have the officials who proposed this not made a mistake in their thinking? The Central National Medicine Hall cannot be regarded as the same as a foreign consulate. The day before yesterday, I read Jiao Yitang's letter to the nation published in the Capital Daily. In the end, it was all old news. He said that Western medicine focuses on materials, that Chinese medicine is good at treating diseases, that Chinese medicine theories cannot be expressed in formulas, but that its treatment results are still correct, that so-and-so's disease could not be cured by Western medicine but was cured by a certain doctor, that a certain important person deeply believed in Western medicine, so his carbuncle on his back has not healed, that the Ministry of Health has spent a lot of national funds, but cholera is still rampant, and that the living standards of Chinese people are not suitable for seeing Western doctors. In short, he advocates for the preservation of Chinese medicine. However, the preservation of Chinese medicine is entirely an academic issue. However, his article did make a mistake. The proposed National Medicine Regulations completely mixed academics and administration, and wanted to hand over this political power to the Central National Medicine Hall, which has no status in the administrative organization. How do you think this is possible? I think that the officials in the Legislative Yuan are well-versed in this type of administrative system organization and will not blindly follow. Taking a step back, if the officials in the Legislative Yuan also express their agreement, then, in order to avoid the suspicion of disrupting the administrative system, the following confirmations must be made first: (1) Establish the status of the Central National Medicine Hall so that it is subordinate to something. (2) The Central National Medicine Hall should remain an academic research institution and continue to exist as before. A separate Ministry of Medical Administration should be established, on par with other ministries, to specifically manage the administrative affairs of National Medicine. (3) The administrative aspects of National Medicine should be handed over to the Ministry of Interior to draft special articles. (4) The National Medicine Regulations should be handed over to the Department of Health to implement. In this way, National Medicine will first be subordinate to something, so that administrative measures can be based on something. Otherwise, the Legislative Yuan itself may also have inconveniences.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Author's Announcement) This column is a question-and-answer format and is not a correspondence question-and-answer service. Readers, please do not misunderstand and waste your time and postage by sending inquiries.</p>
<p>(14) Dysentery (A. Bacterial) Question: Is dysentery an infectious disease of the intestines? Answer: Yes. The pathogens of this disease also invade the intestinal tract.</p>
<p>Question: Dysentery can be divided into two types. One is called bacterial dysentery, which is caused by dysentery bacteria invading the large intestine. The other is amoebic dysentery, which is caused by dysentery amoebae invading the intestines. Question: How are the pathogenic bacteria of bacterial dysentery spread?</p>
<p>Answer: In summer or autumn, due to careless eating and drinking, items and foods containing viruses are eaten and invade the intestines, often spreading in a temporary epidemic. Question: How do these items and foods contain viruses?</p>
<p>Answer: All items that have been used by dysentery patients, or drinking water that has been contaminated by the excrement of patients, or food that has been touched by flies, contain viruses.</p>
<p>Question: How many days after infection with bacterial dysentery does it take to develop the disease? During this period, the patient does not feel anything, but there may be a loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort, and irregular bowel movements.</p>
<p>Question: What happens when the disease develops?</p>
<p>Answer: It starts with mild abdominal pain, accompanied by several episodes of diarrhea and a slight fever. Later, the number of bowel movements increases further, from several times to dozens of times a day. The stool loses its normal consistency and contains mucus, blood, or pus, and emits a foul odor. Usually, stools mixed with blood are called red dysentery, and stools containing mucus or pus are called white dysentery. Regardless of the number of bowel movements, each episode is only about ten to twenty grams. Before defecation, there is abdominal rumbling and colic, followed by a feeling of urgency (tenesmus).</p>
<p>Question: What is the patient's body temperature like?</p>
<p>Answer: The patient's body temperature rises slightly... If the affected area involves the lower section of the small intestine, then there will be a high fever, and even cerebral symptoms, very similar to typhoid fever. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e203">A Brief Overview of Medicine and Pharmacy in Shanghai in the Last Decade (Continued) <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Administration of Medicine and Pharmacy</p>
<p>Section Three: Recent Government Orders</p>
<p>Let's look at government orders again. The granting of the name "New Medicine" and the unrestricted registration of old doctors, and the advocacy of the National Medicine Hall, which is famous in name but not in reality, these facts can further prove that my above-mentioned "distorted political views" are not conjecture. On the one hand, it can also be seen that the Department of Health is no longer trusted by the current government and is in an unspeakable position of pain. However, speaking of it again, the current Department of Health's overemphasis on continentalization may not be the reason for causing displeasure among the old-fashioned bigwigs.</p>
<p>In the era of the Beijing Ministry of Interior and the Shanghai Commercial Port, new doctors were called "physicians." By the time of the Special Municipal Health Bureau, a parenthesis was added under "physician," noting "Western medicine," as if someone wanted to define us as foreign goods. When the Ministry of Health was established, it was again called "physician," and the regulations of the National Government directly called it "Western medicine," as if there was an intention to treat us as foreigners. The Examination Yuan simply added the two words "Western medicine" above "physician," calling it "Western medicine physician," which is a precursor to the future establishment of "National medicine physician." The newly revised and flexible measures of the Ministry of Interior, on the other hand, call it "physician" again. Looking at it this way, it is still difficult to predict whether there will be a newer name in the future. So the funny friend is like, "The Department of Health is like an unpowered concubine in an old family, managing a group of scientists who are like bereaved parents. The clan leader insists that scientific medicine is an adopted son and should only be called a surrendered son, retaining the name to give to the嫡派. On the one hand, calling orphaned children and on the other hand, changing to surrender sons. Finally, the Examination Yuan of Mr. Xixi said. Call them surrender orphaned children." According to this friend's analogy. Basically, the officials will not write elegies. That is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>As for the officialdom for the new medicine industry. In the 17th year, the Special Municipal Health Bureau was vigorous. Requires every pharmacy. There must be a formal pharmacist dispensing medicine. However, the fact is that let alone not enough pharmacists. Even if enough. There are many difficulties. So in Shanghai. At that time, each pharmacy was required to follow the order and hire a pharmacy expert to come forward. The rest of the apprentices. as an assistant. On the one hand, to prepare for remedial classes. So that those apprentice-style dispensing doctors. can obtain a pharmacist license. Now the Department of Health. To issue a nationwide order to do the same. Of course, the shortage of talents is becoming more and more acute. And turn into an order that does not work. Simply even Shanghai's remedial class. I haven’t heard anything about it either.</p>
<p>There are also rules for the management of patent medicine for patent medicine merchants. However, the slippery medicines manufactured in the concessions are increasing. And similar so-called new Chinese medicines. There is no way to ban it. Because Chinese medicine shops. Basically not greatly managed by the Health Bureau.) To be continued (</p>

<p>— Yu Songjun</p>
<p>)24( Management of Abortion and Premature Birth) A. Abortion and Premature Birth (Abortion after one or two months of pregnancy is mostly discharged unconsciously, without the doctor or midwife noticing. There is also a case where the pregnancy is not yet known, and the person goes out for a trip. Later, the period is suddenly more common, this type; is often a very early abortion.</p>
<p>What is called abortion? It refers to early delivery before seven months of pregnancy, when the fetus still has no ability to live outside the womb. What is called premature birth, means that although the fetus is separated from the mother's womb, it can live, but it has not yet reached the delivery period, it has already been delivered, so it is stable to be a premature birth, according to statistics, the abortion and premature birth of multiparous women is more than that of primiparous women. Now there is a statistical table, based on the amount of findings among 1,226 women, as a comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>)Parous women abortion, Premature birth (Primi parous Women, 131 people 488, Multiparous Women, 241 people 906 people, The easiest time to abort is mostly around three or four months of pregnancy, coming the most, after which it gradually decreases. Abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is actually lightly done by the person unconsciously. As for one month or more and three months or less, then... there is considerable danger, if it is delayed to about five months, then abortion often causes major bleeding, and people suffering from acute avarice or weak heart, there is also the crisis of dying as a result, there is also a so-called incomplete abortion, only the germ cells flow out, all the placenta, etc., still remain in the placenta, which is also a very dangerous thing, which cannot be avoided by a doctor, surgery must be performed first to completely remove it before you can be worry-free.</p>
<p>(B. Omen and Management of Abortion) The omen of abortion, in about a month of pregnancy, flowing down with the period, is unconsciously, without any omen. If you abort in the second or third month of pregnancy, the mucus mixed with blood stains flows down first, after about five or six days or ten days, it is like the air is not smooth, and then suddenly feel back pain, back pain without rest, and then start labor pain, but because of this bleeding, can it be determined to be an abortion? It must be that way. In short; delaying medical treatment is really urgent, if you can do so, you can be spared the worst, and there is also a method of preventing injection.</p>
<p>For the first-aid treatment of abortion, you should lie down quietly on your back, relax your spirit, and place an ice pack on your lower abdomen, use a finger cotton bandage and tape to block the local area, as for the treatment of abortion, it is no different from a normal delivery, but in the points that should be paid attention to, it should be strictly followed. (C. Abortion Should Not Be Ignored) In general, people tend to despise abortion, although it does not greatly harm life in fact, but it is also easy to cause endometritis or substantial inflammation, etc., and it is not a small number of people who become infertile. Also, because part of the placenta and amnion remains in the womb, it causes puerperal fever, or malignant chorionic epithelial tumor, which is a malignant tumor in the womb, resulting in loss of life.</p>
<p>(D. Causes and Prevention of Abortion and Premature Birth) There are many reasons for abortion and premature birth, of which fewer occur due to simple reasons, most of them are caused by a combination of various reasons, so people who are pregnant must have this common sense, so that they can be careful. The main points are described below:</p>
<p>One of the main causes is fetal death, and there are various reasons for fetal death, but no matter what the reason, if the fetus dies one day, it must be discharged from the mother's body.</p>
<p>Pregnant women suffer from infectious diseases such as pneumonia, typhoid fever, cholera, malaria, erysipelas, etc., or have suffered from kidney disease, heart disease, beriberi, pulmonary tuberculosis, leukorrhea, syphilis, etc. Pregnant women have endometritis, substantial inflammation, swelling and sputum, uterine retroflexion, etc.</p>
<p>The location of the placenta is abnormal (that is, placenta previa) Changes such as polyhydramnios, umbilical cord torsion, and twins. Pregnant women suffer from external injuries, that is, due to falls, collisions, disputes, etc., they are stimulated and damaged, or use hot water foot baths, sitz baths, and sea baths, such as long-distance trekking, traveling, boat and car fatigue, abnormal mental emotion, accidental fright, excessive intercourse, etc.</p>
<p>○ Taking medicine during pregnancy is also a cause of abortion and premature birth.</p>
<p>Among the above various causes, such as syphilis, kidney inflammation, uterine retroflexion, endometritis, swelling and sputum, etc., if not completely cured, it is easy to become habitual abortion or habitual premature birth, which will inevitably occur repeatedly, leaving endless troubles and becoming a permanent evil result of infertility.</p>
<p>The prevention method, in addition to first understanding the above various main causes, if the omen of abortion is found, promptly implement the appropriate treatment, then; or this disease can be avoided, this appropriate treatment, in addition to the above-mentioned emergency treatment, should also avoid various exciting foods, and make the spirit and body not fatigued. If you are fortunate enough to turn danger into safety, then; the recuperation afterwards, of course, should be extra careful.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Oblivion <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>We have a virtue called oblivion. Oblivion is something everyone and every country has, but we Chinese are particularly good at it, forgetting quickly and cleanly. Whenever unpleasant things happen, while we don't completely ignore them at the time, treating them like fleeting clouds, we can always calmly dismiss them afterwards, as if nothing happened. Even things that aren't so distasteful can be forgotten over time without us even realizing it. For example, officials often forget the blunt advice they gave when they were out of office, young people mostly forget their youthful ambitions, and teachers forget everything they experienced as students.</p>
<p>If we constantly dwell on a pain, always frowning and mourning as if we've lost our parents, wouldn't life become utterly devoid of joy? Moreover, worry can harm us, and if it actually causes illness, wouldn't we be shortening our natural lifespan? Therefore, oblivion is indispensable. Being able to forget allows us to be optimistic, and knowing our fate allows us to settle our lives peacefully. Thus, personal cultivation, family harmony, national governance, and world peace can be established and awaited. The reason China is not yet fully peaceful is probably because oblivion is not yet thorough enough. Furthermore, according to psychologists, people often forget painful and unpleasant things, and the more unpleasant they are, the faster they are forgotten. So, perhaps things in China haven't been terrible enough to make people quickly forget them, preventing us from reaching a state of perfect governance. Thus, there is some indication here on how to bring the nation and society to peace and prosperity, and I believe that current measures and facilities are in line with this grand plan.</p>
<p>There is another meaning to oblivion as a virtue: only by forgetting the old can we accept new ideas. If our minds are full of old, stale, and unpleasant things, how can we accommodate and accept all the new and pleasant things? On the one hand, new events can promote the forgetting of old events. For example, after the May 3rd Jinan Incident, we must forget the May 30th Nanjing Road Incident, and after the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, we must forget the May 3rd Incident. With the loss of Rehe and the North China Armistice Agreement, we must forget that the Northeast was originally Chinese territory. On the other hand, with the hope of winning a 500,000 yuan construction lottery, the losses suffered under the artillery fire in Zhabei must be put out of our minds, and the slogan of cultivating national strength must banish long-term resistance from our memories. I believe that even newer and more pleasant events will emerge, exciting us and making us forget the old entirely, even forgetting that we are Chinese. Oblivion also has a nemesis: the repetition and reminding of events. For example, the May 3rd Incident involved the Japanese, and the September 18th and January 28th Incidents also involved the Japanese. Therefore, the idea that the Japanese are the enemies of the Chinese people cannot be forgotten without prolonged effort. Also, like the civil war, which happens every three months, with fighting resuming every two months, the civil war is deeply hated and resented by the people. The people of Sichuan, for example, must not have forgotten the civil war yet. Chinese people like peace and like to forget, but some people insist on repeating those actions and not allowing people to forget. They are the great enemies of the Chinese people. Those who can bring forth the new through the old are the great talents of governing the country. It is reported that the Barbusse Investigation Group will come to China. I think we have all forgotten the September 18th Incident, and the Lytton Report has become waste paper, but the old man comes from afar to remind us of this unpleasant event. He will surely be opposed by all the people of our country, just like a person in a dream who doesn't like to be called. I think there will always be an event that manifests this, as we indeed have the virtue of oblivion and love this virtue very much, which will surely be fully revealed at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e206">About Zheng Ziyin <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>In Hu Shih's "Fifty Years of Chinese Literature," he once introduced the great poet Zheng Zhen of Guizhou. Zheng Zhen, styled Ziyin, was a native of Zunyi, born in 1806 and died in 1864. He wrote "Nest Sutra Nest Poetry Collection" and other books. Hu Shih said that his collection contained "countless materials for sad poems." Years ago, in Hubei, I was able to borrow the original printed edition of his poetry collection from a friend and selected several poems. At that time, my favorite poems were the nine selected from Volume Three, "Elegy for Second and Third Younger Brothers, Twenty Poems." The poems say:</p>
<p>My ill fate ends here in this life,</p>
<p>Not only a severed hand but also a severed throat.</p>
<p>What can be said about the way of Heaven?</p>
<p>Grief surges like a mountain, but tears do not flow!</p>
<p>The fate of my declining family is pitiful,</p>
<p>No one is as outstanding and virtuous as you.</p>
<p>Even if future generations can be like you,</p>
<p>When the temple is built, the ghosts will be old, and what year will it be?</p>
<p>The rooster crows, calling me to the west side of the house,</p>
<p>A final farewell, only breath remains in your throat.</p>
<p>Eyes point to your three children, entrusting them with a sob,</p>
<p>A lifetime of brotherhood ends in an instant!</p>
<p>Heartbroken that my path grows old and still goes wrong,</p>
<p>How can my limbs be nourished when I am always hungry?</p>
<p>Causing you to suffer in life and suffer in death,</p>
<p>Even in death, you are still clothed in your elder brother's clothes!</p>
<p>I repeatedly planned to travel to Shu, hesitating again and again,</p>
<p>But last month, for no reason, I went and returned again.</p>
<p>I only said that there was a divine intention in our mutual life,</p>
<p>How could I know that it was to see you to your final resting place!</p>
<p>The autumn wind and rain sound mournful,</p>
<p>The pine trees around the mountains were all planted by you.</p>
<p>If even one root does not die, yet my brother dies,</p>
<p>I would cut down everything, not just the ancestral graves.</p>
<p>You served me like a brother, and your wife was like a mother,</p>
<p>Your sister-in-law's heart aches as she tears open her chest.</p>
<p>Most unbearable is the sound of each sob,</p>
<p>I think of all the ways in the world, but none can heal.</p>
<p>My younger brother roared with anger this morning,</p>
<p>His orphaned children fill my eyes, what can I do?</p>
<p>Climbing onto the bed, we all mourn together,</p>
<p>The servants blow the horn and my son plays the zither.</p>
<p>You also reached your life's end at the age of forty-three,</p>
<p>Surely, death is more joyful than a life of poverty.</p>
<p>Thinking that this is not a long-term parting,</p>
<p>I have already become an old man of sixty-nine.</p>
<p>Later, in Shanghai, I bought the "Complete Collection of Poetry and Prose from Nest Sutra Nest," edited and printed by the Ancient Fragrance Huang Family's Ancient Fool Studio. From the various texts in the "Appendix," I learned that his life was extremely miserable. "He suffered from the chaos of the times, the unspeakable hardships of life, wandering and displacement, until his sons were poor and died." In these dozen volumes of poems, there is much tragic historical material from that time, but I only read them hastily and can hardly remember them now. Someday, when I have the time, I would like to read them again and organize this kind of material.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Misfortune <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The wheat has been harvested. After piling all the wheat grains threshed on the threshing ground into the granary, I couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief, as if the burden on my shoulders had lightened a lot.</p>
<p>Walking with a dry tobacco pipe in my mouth, in the soft May evening breeze, I was thinking. My heart was joyful.</p>
<p>"This year's harvest is really not bad! Who would have thought that such rainy weather would produce such a good harvest. If we hadn't lost money on silkworm cocoons, we wouldn't have to worry about making a living for the first half of the year."</p>
<p>I said this to my son. In my heart, I was thinking of many things... Even if this year's wheat price is discounted, it can't escape the price of seven yuan and some change per load. In past years, didn't it sell for more than eight yuan per load? I harvested thirty loads, three sevens are twenty-one, which means I can sell it for two hundred yuan. With this money, not only can I repay Li Laoye's debt with a three-percent interest, but I can also redeem the unlined jacket from the pawnshop. My wife has been complaining about the calico fabric for a long time, and maybe I can even buy some goods for Little Niuzi.</p>
<p>But the next morning, the landlord Chen Daye came to the village in person to collect rent. As soon as he entered the door, he stretched his face and said...</p>
<p>"This year's harvest is good, so I want to collect seven dou of wheat from each mu of land." Seven dou of wheat! I couldn't help but be shocked. Isn't this going to take away half of my family's food and clothing? I could only beg him with a bitter face, asking him to reduce it a bit. My wife also grabbed his clothes and pleaded with him, tears almost falling down.</p>
<p>Chen Daye's heart was truly harder than iron. He turned his face away, snorted, and shouted to the subordinates who came with him to measure the wheat. We were arguing and grabbing, my wife was crying and threatening to hang herself, but it was all useless. The wheat was finally taken away by them! The wheat granary was half empty. Wheat grains were scattered all over the ground. The wheat they took away was at least ten loads.</p>
<p>Several chickens ran over, pecking at the wheat grains on the ground. I kicked them painfully, and they all scattered. One of them squawked strangely and lunged at Little Niuzi's face, scaring Little Niuzi to cry.</p>
<p>Wang Laoda from next door suddenly came over and asked me to go to the city together to ask about the wheat price. I was a little happy again in my heart. There were still twenty loads of wheat left, and as long as the price was the same as in previous years, I could still sell them for one hundred and some change, first pay back the interest on the debt, and then save some... This life can barely be lived.</p>
<p>With such hope, I went to the city. With great difficulty, I walked to the entrance of the Jumi Rice Shop, my heart beating especially hard, and even my arms were trembling a little. I watched Wang Laoda walk to the counter of the rice shop and ask...</p>
<p>"How much is the wheat price selling for?"</p>
<p>"Two and a half yuan."</p>
<p>Two and a half yuan! A thunderbolt struck my ears, and my mind went completely blank. Heavens! What kind of price is this! Am I dreaming? I seemed to see Li Laoye forcing me to pay off the debt, my wife clamoring for calico fabric, Little Niuzi crying for goods, and the unlined jacket pawned in the pawnshop waving before my eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Pearl S. Buck's New Book <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Yi Xian, the translator of "The Good Earth," write an article introducing Pearl S. Buck. Today, I will introduce her new book, "The First Wife," based on The New York Times.</p>
<p>"The First Wife" is a collection of short stories. The story that serves as the title can be said to be a concrete and micro version of her previous novel "East Wind West Wind," again telling the story of a husband influenced by the West and a wife under the old tradition. However, the ending of "East Wind West Wind" is complete, while "The First Wife" is tragic. The husband returns from abroad, and the wife tries her best, but she cannot make her husband happy. He feels that a new life has begun, but she only knows her own world, so she finally commits suicide.</p>
<p>The second short story, "The Old Mother," also tells of the struggle between the old and the new. This story tells of the unhappiness of the old mother. The son is educated abroad and marries a modern girl as his wife. The young couple feels that the old mother's way of life is too outdated, and the old mother also thinks that the two of them are too absurd. "The Day Before" tells of another problem. A young student returns from abroad and finds that his family and relatives are sacrificing their own comfortable lives to increase his status, hoping that he can repay them, but he wants to serve humanity. Should he repay private恩 [ēn, favor/kindness] or serve humanity? He is at a crossroads.</p>
<p>There are also three other short stories... One is about a Westerner's incomprehension of the Chinese, another is Chekhovian, about the unhappy married life of a rural couple, and the last one tells the story of a French petit-bourgeois woman who marries a poor Chinese man and cannot understand his noble character.</p>
<p>There are also several stories under the big topic of "revolution." The first one may be of particular interest to the reader of "The Good Earth," because this is the origin of Wang Long's story. Another one writes about the thoughts of a revolutionary woman in the hours before her execution. "Father Andrea" is the story of a clergyman.</p>
<p>In the last four abridged stories, Pearl S. Buck makes us feel the complex psychology of Chinese farmers resisting floods and famines.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I read in your publication of July 19th an article by Mr. Wang He, "Talking About the Selection of So-Called Rare Books from the Siku Quanshu," which was relayed to me by a friend.</p>
<p>I am grateful that your publication has published Mr. Wang's concerns about culture and corrections. However, the news reports from various newspapers on the twelfth of last month regarding my talk about the Siku Quanshu were quite inconsistent with the facts, and there were many errors and omissions. I sent a telegram to the Daily News Agency, which published the article, the day after it was reported, raising all the points pointed out by Mr. Wang and asking them to correct them. The news agency was responsible for sending correction letters to various newspapers in Beijing, and many have been published. Although the wording was not detailed, the facts are there for examination. Others may not be aware of this and may have many misunderstandings. Therefore, I drafted this letter in the hope that you will publish it. I am most grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>Zichun's wife, Guanlan, also known as Lao Wu, was such an impatient person. On that entire day of January 28th, she was busy at home, preparing the New Year's Eve dinner. Saying she was "busy" might not be an exaggeration, because the menu for this New Year's Eve dinner was not only elaborate but also complex. The reason for this was to entertain Yao Yongsun. Lao Wu had recently heard Yongsun often talk to Zichun about the fragrant, crisp, and fresh flavors of Fujian cuisine, and she also remembered that Yongsun used to love the crispy, sweet, and exquisite Suzhou boat dishes and pastries. So, as soon as she had arranged for Yongsun to come for the New Year's Eve dinner a few days ago, she had asked someone to find famous chefs from the Suzhou and Fujian schools to come to her home to cook on January 28th, while she herself directed and commanded from the sidelines. Moreover, she was entertaining Yongsun in the manner of entertaining "family," so besides Yongsun, she only invited Yongsun's most trusted retainer, Hong Suiwu, and two young ladies she had met at "Number 281," totaling five people, including herself and her husband.</p>
<p>In the evening, she learned from Zichun that the concession had announced martial law. This inevitably made her a little worried, fearing that Yongsun would not come. Later, she saw that the situation on Chongqing Road outside the door was not panicked, and the night market was still brightly lit, so her heart was half relieved. Soon, the two female guests arrived one after another. They each talked about the situations they had seen outside, and they all concluded that at least in the western district of the concession, everything was the same as usual. However, they were always waiting for the honored guest that day, always anxious but outwardly calm. It was not until about eight o'clock that Yongsun, accompanied by Suiwu, walked in.</p>
<p>This New Year's Eve dinner lasted for more than two hours before it came to an end. Yongsun greatly praised Lao Wu's cooking, and whenever he said a few words of praise, Suiwu would vigorously prove from the side the reasons why it was worthy of praise, so the conversation at the table was also very smooth.</p>
<p>Later, Lao Wu invited them all upstairs to smoke. Zichun chatted with Suiwu and the two female guests, while Lao Wu sat beside Yongsun on the opium couch and prepared the opium for him. In this way, he slowly began to ask about the profits and losses of gambling this year. "This year, I'm probably going to lose about four thousand!" Lao Wu said. "Well," Yongsun said, "that's not a small amount!"</p>
<p>"It's the New Year! I've managed to get by somehow; but after the New Year, I don't have any ideas."</p>
<p>"Ah!" Yongsun sighed in a way that was both intentional and unintentional.</p>
<p>"And what I've managed to get by with somehow still has to be paid back to others!"</p>
<p>"Well, you have to find a way."</p>
<p>"Find a way! Third Master, only you can do it!" As she said this, she raised her head and glanced at Yongsun. "If it were Zichun, he has too few connections."</p>
<p>"That's not so difficult! Slowly... Today is already the twenty-first. I can invite a group of friends to play with you for half a month during the New Year! This way, besides expenses, we can still make a good amount of money!"</p>
<p>"That would be really great! Third Master, thank you so much. But how would we play?" "It's still the old tricks! Fan-tan, pai gow, of course, are indispensable... If the scene is good, we can also have thirty-six doors."</p>
<p>"That would be really great! Third Master, thank you so much. But where would we play?"</p>

<h3 id="e211">The Quality and Quantity of Raw Cotton Needed in the Future: Zhu Xian Textile <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Cloth is made from yarn, and yarn is made from cotton. To produce excellent cloth, you must have excellent yarn. To produce excellent yarn, you must have excellent cotton. Therefore, the quality of raw cotton is the main factor in producing excellent yarn and cloth. This is in terms of the quality of the finished product. As for the spinning process, it is even more crucial. If inferior cotton or cotton fibers of non-standard length are used to spin high-count yarn, the amount of waste will increase, the work will be difficult, and production will inevitably decrease. The finished yarn will also be inferior due to insufficient strength. This will affect the weaving process, causing malfunctions, resulting in poor output and inferior fabrics. Therefore, the essential qualities of the raw cotton required for the spinning process, i.e., so-called "excellent cotton," are sevenfold: (1) bright white color, (2) pure and free of impurities, (3) rich in natural twist, (4) fine, long, and soft, (5) uniform length, (6) possessing air space, and (7) adequate strength and elasticity. These have been detailed in my previous work, "The Essential Qualities of Cotton Fibers Required for the Spinning Process." Now, from the standpoint of human progress and industrial rationalization, I will discuss the quality of cotton that our country will need in the future.</p>
<p>(1) The Quality of Cotton Needed for Future Human Progress: As human culture advances daily, material enjoyment also progresses in quality. Clothing is no longer merely for warmth and covering the body but to satisfy desires. Consequently, the demand for coarse, thick cloth decreases daily. Fine cloth, replacing coarse, thick cloth, increases in quantity. The raw cotton for yarn and cloth also gradually becomes finer with the times. Our country's raw cotton has coarse, short fibers that cannot be used to manufacture high-count yarn and fine cloth. To meet the demands of the times, textile factories must spin fine yarn. Inevitably, they must source raw materials from abroad to make up for the deficiency. Below is a classified comparison of the percentage of cotton consumption by yarn factories nationwide in the past four years:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Consumption Percentages by Year</p>
<p>| Cotton Type | Year 18 | Year 19 | Year 20 | Year 21 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Chinese Cotton | 68.25 | 63.11 | 49.67 | 52.13 |</p>
<p>| American Cotton | 13.66 | 13.60 | 26.43 | 38.58 |</p>
<p>| Indian Cotton | 17.99 | 22.76 | 23.29 | 8.81 |</p>
<p>| Egyptian Cotton | 0.04 | 0.21 | 0.31 | 0.03 |</p>
<p>| Other | - | 0.32 | 0.30 | 0.45 |</p>
<p>From the table above, the consumption of Chinese cotton decreased from 68.25% in Year 18 to 38.58% in Year 21. The total consumption of American and Egyptian cotton increased from 13.72% to 39.03%. In Year 20, the total consumption of foreign cotton exceeded that of domestic cotton. In Year 21, it was almost equal. Although this was due to continuous years of famine and poor cotton harvests in the country, the inferior quality of Chinese cotton, which cannot be used to weave fine yarn and cloth, is also a major reason for the decline in consumption. Recently, the consumption of fine, long-fiber American and Egyptian cotton has been increasing daily, while the consumption of coarse, short Chinese and Indian cotton has been decreasing. The situation is becoming increasingly apparent. Factories purchase over 3.5 million piculs of foreign cotton annually, costing over 140 million Customs Taels. The cloth made from this cotton is mostly sold in rural areas. This is equivalent to taking the loss from importing raw cotton and shifting it to the rural areas. On the one hand, the raw cotton produced in rural areas does not meet the demands of textile factories, making it difficult to obtain good prices. On the other hand, the burden of clothing expenses increases, not in proportion to what they produce. As a result, the economy collapses, purchasing power weakens, and the impact on commerce leads to the decline of markets. For industry, it results in unsold inventory. The entire country suffers, unable to extricate itself. Although the decline of our country's economy is due to multiple factors, the lack of production of fine raw cotton has a direct and indirect impact. Therefore, to revitalize the rural economy and supply the textile factories with raw cotton, we must follow the trend of human progress, promote the improvement of raw cotton quality, and meet our own needs. In other words, we must strive to produce fine, long, strong, and white raw cotton. Fine and long fibers can be used to spin high-count yarn. Strength ensures that even high-count yarn has relatively high strength. Whiteness ensures that the finished product is free from defects. These are the essential requirements for producing fine yarn. This is the quality of raw cotton needed in the future from the perspective of human progress.</p>
<p>(2) The Quality of Cotton Needed for Future Industrial Rationalization: The principle of industrial rationalization is to maximize production efficiency with the least amount of machinery and labor. Reducing machinery reduces the initial fixed capital and saves on recurring power, labor, and material consumption. Reducing labor reduces the cost of employing workers. Increasing production reduces the average cost per unit of consumption. This chain reaction leads to lower prices for finished products. Modern textile machinery is also manufactured according to this principle. However, cotton is the only factor that can enable its rationalization. The single-process equipment in the opening room, the "Rieter" and "New Blash" in the carding room, and the high drafting in the spinning room all aim to reduce machinery and maximize production efficiency. However, this is only effective when using relatively clean, long, fine, and strong raw cotton. If the raw cotton is not clean, the fine impurities cannot be completely removed in the cleaning and carding rooms, resulting in defects in the yarn. The drafting action in the roving and spinning rooms will be difficult to perfect. Work will be difficult, output will decrease, and waste will increase. Furthermore, the use of large packages in the roving and spinning machines, the use of multi-spindle winders, and the adoption of automatic devices in weaving machines are all intended to extend doffing and reduce shuttle change times, thereby maximizing efficiency with minimal labor. However, without the use of long, fine, and strong cotton, these effects cannot be achieved. Frequent yarn breaks and frequent machine stops make work difficult, increase labor, and workers cannot endure the tedium, leading to mental exhaustion. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in automatic looms. To achieve automatic efficiency without manual shuttle change, the warp yarn must be resistant to breakage. The ability of the warp yarn to resist breakage depends on the use of cotton with the finest and strongest fibers. In summary, the industrial rationalization of the spinning process depends on the use of raw cotton with clean, long, fine, and strong fibers. This is the quality of raw cotton needed in the future from the perspective of industrial rationalization.</p>
<p>Next, I will discuss the quantity of cotton that our country will need in the future. First, according to the Customs records,</p>
<p>I will list the import values of cotton goods, cotton yarn, and raw cotton since the founding of the Republic, as well as the import volume of cotton, to show the growth and decline of cotton production and imports in our country over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>| Year | Cotton Goods (Customs Taels) | Cotton Yarn (Customs Taels) | Raw Cotton (Customs Taels) | Raw Cotton (Piculs) |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Year 1 | 84,927,866 | 63,352,860 | 4,929,402 | 2,793,56 |</p>
<p>| Year 2 | 133,369,801 | 72,946,905 | 31,262,211 | 1,289,35 |</p>
<p>| Year 3 | 127,163,276 | 67,433,544 | 34,404,031 | 333,87 |</p>
<p>| Year 4 | 228,738,616 | 68,572,180 | 70,416,693 | 363,322 |</p>
<p>| Year 5 | 752,522,516 | 64,253,446 | 84,560,654 | 407,225 |</p>
<p>| Year 6 | 970,247,606 | 68,544,986 | 67,149,812 | 99,850 |</p>
<p>| Year 7 | 1,001,783,075 | 59,146,116 | 163,308,841 | 189,990 |</p>
<p>| Year 8 | 1,419,802,679 | 134,082,687 | 6,870,674 | 239,218 |</p>
<p>| Year 9 | 1,708,642,798 | 84,507,676 | 184,767,266 | 686,373 |</p>
<p>| Year 10 | 1,457,014,797 | 72,158,170 | 362,731,901 | 1,704,060 |</p>
<p>| Year 11 | 1,541,240,267 | 71,229,571 | 439,872,501 | 1,780,618 |</p>
<p>| Year 12 | 1,328,711,374 | 44,178,897 | 546,504,316 | 1,614,371 |</p>
<p>| Year 13 | 1,544,710,493 | 36,867,638 | 498,368,951 | 1,241,881 |</p>
<p>| Year 14 | 1,520,155,204 | 41,353,981 | 708,525,081 | 1,807,450 |</p>
<p>| Year 15 | 1,721,222,331 | 31,163,048 | 954,738,102 | 2,745,017 |</p>
<p>| Year 16 | 1,317,825,161 | 19,899,614 | 822,042,722 | 2,415,482 |</p>
<p>| Year 17 | 1,665,812,151 | 19,222,867 | 685,487,781 | 1,916,140 |</p>
<p>| Year 18 | 1,674,604,961 | 16,619,289 | 207,810,525 | 2,514,786 |</p>
<p>| Year 19 | 1,328,862,671 | 12,778,344 | 1,332,345,673 | 4,564,940 |</p>
<p>| Year 20 | 1,071,653,474 | 4,091,850 | 1,798,224,646 | 4,652,726 |</p>
<p>| Year 21 | 725,742,589 | 3,579,752 | 1,288,566,153 | 3,712,856 |</p>
<p>From the table above, the import of cotton goods gradually increased after Year 7. The import of cotton yarn was higher before Year 11 and gradually decreased after Year 11. The import of raw cotton was minimal before Year 8 and gradually increased afterward. In Year 20, it reached a high of over 4.6 million piculs, with a value of over 170 million Customs Taels, ranking first among imported goods. This indicates that the domestic supply of raw cotton is insufficient and the quality is not suitable for use. In summary, over the past twenty years, the people of our country have worked hard on the textile industry and made considerable progress. Therefore, the import of cotton yarn has been reduced to a minimum. The import of cotton goods in the last three years has not been as high as it was between Year 8 and Year 18. However, the increase in the import of raw cotton has exceeded the decrease in the import of cotton yarn and cotton goods. The gains from the efforts of the textile industry are not enough to offset the losses from the increased import of raw cotton. The total value of cotton imports has not been reduced. How can the rural economy avoid collapse? How can the national strength avoid daily decline? Cotton farmers do not know how to improve cotton production, and the government does not pay attention to cotton farmers, allowing them to fend for themselves, leading to today's consequences. The opportunity for recovery begins now. Regarding the quantity of cotton needed in the future, I will address those who are dedicated to promoting cotton value.</p>
<p>Our country currently has over 4.5 million spindles. Over 2.5 million spindles are owned by Chinese businesses, while over 2 million spindles are operated by foreign merchants. The annual consumption of cotton is over 8.9 million piculs. Domestic cotton production is over 8 million piculs. After deducting the cotton used for clothing, bedding, and a small portion used in the hand-weaving industry, only about 5 million piculs are available for supply to spinning mills. Therefore, there is still a shortfall of over 3 million piculs, which must be sourced from foreign cotton. However, the current number of spindles is far from being able to be self-sufficient. Even the current cotton production is far from being able to be self-sufficient. Cotton production must be actively increased. Please refer to the development status of the domestic textile industry and promote it in two phases.</p>
<p>The first phase aims to meet the consumption needs of the existing spindles. In addition to the existing production, we must vigorously increase the planting of fine, long, strong, and white cotton: 1.3 million piculs of cotton with a length of 3/4 inch to 1 inch, 3.4 million piculs of cotton with a length of 1 1/16 inch to 1 3/16 inches, and 600,000 piculs of cotton with a length of 1 1/4 inch to 1 1/2 inches. A total increase of 5.3 million piculs is required.</p>
<p>The second phase, according to my work "The Three-Three Plan for Promoting the Cotton Industry," involves increasing spindles by 4.05 million and looms by 97,300. The yarn produced by the spindles can meet the weaving needs of the looms. The cloth produced by the looms can meet the clothing and bedding needs of the entire country. The increase in cotton production must adapt to the consumption of these spindles: 10.1 million piculs of cotton with a length of 3/4 inch to 1 inch, 4.7 million piculs of cotton with a length of 1 1/16 inch to 1 3/16 inches, and 1 million piculs of cotton with a length of 1 1/4 inch to 1 1/2 inches or more. A total of 15.1 million piculs is required.</p>
<p>The above only discusses the quantity of cotton that needs to be increased in the future. As for how to increase cotton fields, how to improve cotton seeds using scientific methods, and how to guide cotton farmers to improve cotton cultivation, these are agricultural matters. At this time when rural areas urgently need to be revitalized and the quality and quantity of raw cotton urgently need to be improved, I hope that those responsible for improving cotton production will recognize the importance of their mission, fulfill their duties, and benefit our rural areas. Supply our textile industry with the raw cotton it needs and stop relying on foreign cotton imports, which will sever our national lifeline. Our textile industry must provide economic cooperation to the cotton industry. Good quality raw cotton should be given a reasonable price to stimulate cotton farmers' interest in improving cotton quality. If producers and consumers work together to increase the quality and quantity of cotton, it will not be difficult to achieve final success. This is what I sincerely hope for.</p>
<h3 id="e212">The Most Serious Currency Problem in the Current Stage of World Economic Panic: Huang Zhang <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The current stage of world economic panic is the most serious ailment afflicting capitalism today. The doctors have gathered once again, including politicians, theorists, practitioners, industrialists, financial experts, and wealthy merchants from various countries. It is truly a magnificent gathering! This is the London World Economic Conference, which opened on June 12 and recently adjourned. These doctors, each with their own remedies, engaged in eloquent debates at the conference. However, they ultimately failed to reach a consensus on a common remedy. The moribund patient, capitalism, continues to writhe in agony on its sickbed. How tragic! What is this intractable ailment? Let us analyze it in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e213">I. Rigid Tariff Barriers <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The current situation, while not hopeless, is certainly serious. This economic ailment is none other than what doctors call "arteriosclerosis." In the major capitalist countries, production figures have decreased by two-fifths compared to 1929. Since last fall, the decline in production figures has stopped, but international trade figures have shown a downward trend. The total volume of world trade in the first three months of 1933 was only 35% of the total volume in the same period of 1929, and even lower than the same period of 1932. The circulation of goods is becoming increasingly difficult, and the major arteries of world trade are becoming more and more stagnant. The economic blood, the goods, is not circulating sufficiently in the blood vessels. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The so-called "arteriosclerosis" of modern capitalism, in economic terms, is "protectionist madness." The closure of borders in various countries has become even more severe in 1933. According to the recent research by the Economic Research Group of the League of Nations, the Industrial Daily News has listed some of the major serious issues as follows:</p>
<p>"From the perspective of tariffs, we can say that since January 1933, the revisions of tariff laws in various countries have been countless. These revisions, instead of alleviating the current ailment, have aggravated it.</p>
<p>Sweden, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Switzerland, Hungary, the United Kingdom, and others have all revised their tariff laws. Germany's increased taxes on livestock and fresh meat have de facto violated certain tariffs stipulated in the commercial treaty signed with France in 1927. Similarly, France, in order to restore its commercial balance with Germany, has also restricted the import of many German goods.</p>
<p>We can also cite the example of Austria, which converted the British gold coins payable as tariffs into schillings. In this conversion, it de facto increased the tax rate by 25%.</p>
<p>France has also increased the so-called 'exchange compensation' additional tax levied on imports from China, Japan, Ceylon, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Soviet Union. Based on these tariff changes, the commercial situation in various countries has had to be reorganized. Everywhere, foreign imports are restricted, and the methods of restriction are being strengthened daily. Because countries are finding other ways to develop various abnormal forms of commerce, France has had to restrict the import of new goods. The same is true for Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary. The economic instability of all countries is naturally reflected in their treaty policies."</p>
<p>Since last fall, the phenomenon of declining production has stopped, which seems to indicate that the current economic situation is somewhat better than a year ago. Today's pain and suffering stem from the fact that after expanding production, we encounter severe tariff wars in various countries, which stiffen the arteries of international commerce, making it impossible for this huge volume of goods to circulate in the international market. If we want to activate the production sector, the only way is for countries to implement a tariff truce! However, in a time when countries want to maintain commercial balance, is a tariff truce possible?</p>
<p>The world economic situation in the three and a half years since the explosion on Wall Street can be summarized as follows: From the perspective of production planning, the panic of oversupply continues to subside, but the ailment of stagnation has taken its place. In most industrial sectors, there is no longer a phenomenon of overproduction. Supply no longer exceeds demand. In fact, supply has been greatly reduced, while demand has increased. The imbalance between production and purchasing power, which caused the panic, has been reduced. Naturally, in a mechanized capitalist society, production either advances or retreats. Since demand has relatively increased and the imbalance between production and purchasing power has been eliminated, the production of various goods has increased. However, unfortunately, just as the possibility of developing production plans arises, serious obstacles occur in the circulation plans: the firm and high tariff barriers, the restrictions on various imported goods, and the bans on the entry of various imported goods seem to completely obstruct international trade. This is a very obvious ailment in the current stage of the world economic panic.</p>
<h3 id="e214">II. Currency Chaos <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>There are two main reasons why international trade is so stagnant. First, some capitalist countries, seeing that the number of their goods sold in foreign markets has greatly decreased, have had to regard their domestic markets as forbidden zones, refusing the import of foreign goods. The economic panic of recent years has pushed this trend to the extreme. Second, the panic of recent years has put the fiscal budgets and banking plans of various countries in a very volatile state, so that the stability of currencies is greatly threatened. Because of the volatility of currency prices, not only have the existing restrictions of various countries become more severe, but also new restrictions are being promulgated in batches. There are two types of these restrictions: Direct restrictions are imposed because some countries' currency situations are already in danger, and they must maintain a minimum amount of gold as a reserve, prohibiting the export of gold. In this way, they de facto lose the ability to purchase goods from abroad. Indirectly, some countries' currencies are stable, but in order to resist the currency hoarding policies of countries with depreciated currencies, they have to adopt protective measures.</p>
<p>Many countries want to maintain the gold standard, and some countries want to abandon the gold standard, but in many cases, the same unfortunate result occurs.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States, not to mention their protectorates and colonies, have made the chaos in the world market more serious since abandoning the gold standard. On the one hand, they prohibit the free circulation of gold, and on the other hand, they have aroused the protective policies and countermeasures of various countries regarding gold.</p>
<p>In order to maintain currency stability and to maintain the integrity of gold reserves, Germany and most of the Central and Eastern European countries have had to issue many regulations to prevent the import of foreign goods. Naturally, those countries that are thus harmed will also find ways to retaliate.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that in the current stage of economic panic, the currency problem is very serious. The international trade market is so depressed, and countries are mutually bound by tariff restrictions. It is clear that we cannot say that after the currency problem is properly resolved, the tide of protectionism can be curbed, and all the tariff barriers that resemble the Great Wall of China can be broken! Besides currency instability, there are other reasons for this protectionism, namely the narrow and monopolistic nature of commodity outlets (such as cartels and syndicates). This is no less important than currency instability! But who will pay attention to this difficult and rigid problem, a problem that is the inevitable trend of capitalism?</p>
<p>This is why the London World Economic Conference specially discussed the currency problem. The opposition between France and the United States and the repeated suspensions of the conference were all due to this currency problem.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Three. The Ideal and Reality of Solving the Currency Problem <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>We know that there is currently a most significant problem in the world, from which the disarmament conference, the Lausanne Conference, and the London Economic Conference all originated; this is the long-unresolved war debt problem. Because the United States opposed discussing this issue at the London Economic Conference, the preparatory committee for the London Conference did not include it on the agenda. Although MacDonald tried his best to propose discussing this issue at the general assembly, it ultimately yielded no results due to the passive resistance of the U.S. representative Hull, who refused to attend. Since the war debt problem remains unresolved, the debtor nations have no choice but to pay cash to the United States, causing their reserves to dwindle day by day, which in turn causes fluctuations in currency values. Without resolving the fundamental war debt problem and merely engaging in peripheral issues such as currency values and opening exchange rates, it is naturally difficult to achieve any results. The failure of the London Conference to achieve any significant results was expected long ago.</p>
<p>It is not enough for us to simply recognize the importance of the currency problem; it is also not enough for us to simply agree that it is necessary to find a way to solve this currency problem. We must know: First, why and in what sense is this currency problem the most important issue in the current stage of the economic panic? Second, how can this problem be solved in any way? Third, if a proper solution is obtained, what methods can we use to make the relevant countries implement it?</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, there are naturally many different opinions. Some economists say that the instability of currency is one of the causes of the world's economic panic. They imagine that the panic occurred because prices have fallen. Such a simplistic observation is no different from saying that the weather is bad because the barometer is indicating rainy weather! The general vulgar economists say that to alleviate the panic, we only need to raise prices. Isn't that like saying that to make the weather clear, we should quickly adjust the rain/sun indicator on the barometer! Such a theory is truly absurd!</p>
<p>Other economists pay more attention to the facts. They believe that the currency problem is not responsible for the economic panic. In other words, the panic is not due to the decline in currency values. Solving the currency problem will not guarantee future prosperity. However, they believe that countries should also find ways to ease their separate protectionist measures because easing protectionist measures would allow capital to flow freely, and industry and commerce could slowly recover. This has considerable merit.</p>
<p>Is the currency problem truly the root of all panics? Are currency fluctuations and price fluctuations truly the cause of the current economic disaster? Or, although the currency problem is not related to the revival of the world's industries, does it still remain a major issue in the current stage of the panic? All of these questions are subject to different opinions and perspectives. For example, the U.S. representative said that the currency problem is not important, and the devaluation of the U.S. dollar is an urgent measure to raise prices, restore people's purchasing power, and revive industry and commerce, which is beneficial to all countries. However, France is in a completely opposite position. She believes that without stabilizing currency values, no international cooperation can begin. These are naturally statements made from the standpoint of national interests, which is not surprising. So, if economists from all countries speak from the standpoint of their national interests, how can a unified view be obtained!</p>
<p>Based on different views on the first question, naturally, there will also be different opinions on the second question: how can this currency problem be solved? Fundamentally speaking, if the United States is unwilling to resolve the war debt problem, then all solutions to the currency problem will still be problems. Even leaving aside the war debt problem, what methods can we use to make the currencies of various countries achieve relatively consistent values? What kind of exchange rate should be used to stabilize the exchange rates of various countries? Is it possible to have countries with different interests in producing, storing, and using gold, as well as producing, storing, and using silver, jointly construct an international currency standard? All of these contradictions cannot be resolved in a selfish and self-serving capitalist world. It is not at all surprising that the London Conference could not reach a unified conclusion.</p>
<p>Regarding the third question, if we obtain a proper solution, what methods can we use to make the relevant countries implement it? This is very obvious. International conferences are not uncommon in history. The result of the conferences is always the emergence of some grand resolutions, but once the conference is over, everyone still acts according to their own interests, regarding the resolutions as mere words. How often have we seen the fact of abiding by covenants!</p>
<p>Therefore, although the currency problem is a most serious problem in the current stage of the panic, it is not a fundamental problem. Even if the London Conference continues to meet and obtain some temporary measures to stabilize currencies, it will ultimately not solve the world's economic panic. This is because there is no way to eliminate the selfish and self-serving economic systems of various countries, and there is no way to eliminate the economic contradictions between countries. Moreover, the war debt problem after the European war continues to intensify the antagonism between Europe and the United States! (Drafted on July 27, 1933.)</p>

<p>The bond market weakened throughout the past week. From July 31st to August 5th, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw a slight decline in the market due to the market conditions offering an opportunity for short-selling speculation. The situation, such as Feng's stubbornness and the central government's intention for peace, had not yet been realized. The Japanese were also taking threatening actions in North China and engaging in various forms of coercion and sabotage against the League of Nations' technical cooperation. All of this news was unfavorable to the bulls. This was just the surface situation. In fact, since the market prices had soared on July 19th, most contracts were already around 65% of par value. The 18 series and 19 series customs bonds were already above 78% of par value. At this time, it was actually awakening the shorts' desire to observe. However, because of short covering before the settlement of the July futures contracts, the prices were still fluctuating. After the July 28th settlement, Feng's army remained stubborn, and the rumors in North China intensified. The shorts became bolder. Various groups and the North Group sold off every day, causing the market prices to struggle but ultimately fail to rally due to the severe oppression of the shorts. The market gradually declined day by day. On Monday, the central government issued a telegram calling for peace, but Feng's army had not yet responded. News of the loss of Duolun emerged, and short selling surged. The market prices fell by a small amount of 7-8 jiao. On Tuesday, the North Group had another large-scale fire sale, and the market still failed to recover. On Wednesday, large players and the North Group continued to sell, and the bulls also emerged, causing another decline of 7-8 jiao. On Thursday, the North Group continued to sell, but the large players showed no interest, continuing the small decline of 3-4 jiao to 7-8 jiao. On Friday, although the North Group had stopped selling, the bulls and retail investors emerged and sold short, causing the market to continue to decline, even more severely than before, with declines ranging from several jiao to over two yuan. In total, the market fell for six consecutive days until Friday. The market conditions were indeed unfavorable to the bulls, but in reality, it was still due to the fierce and repeated suppression by the sellers, which caused the bulls to wait and see to prevent organized short selling. On Saturday, the situation suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse. The bulls seized the opportunity to retaliate, and the shorts were defeated. Therefore, the shorts initially wanted to suppress the market to a small extent, but ultimately, because people's confidence had already increased, the market prices turned sharply higher, recovering several jiao to 1.6-1.7 yuan. At this time, the North Group's shorts were still waiting and seeing. The future trend is still subject to many changes. As a result of the week's market prices, there was a total decline ranging from several jiao to two yuan. The trading volume was also quite active, with a total turnover of 61,009,500 yuan, including 69,500 yuan in spot transactions and 60,094,000 yuan in futures transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Where Exactly is the Way Out? <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>In this everything is contradictory and deformed society, it is inevitable to reflect the accumulated contradictions. Therefore, things like "getting rich quick," "horse racing tickets," and "lottery tickets" should also be products of a contradictory society, you see. Many people grasp at anything in the more contradictory it is. It is clear that the hope of buying any lottery ticket is as illusory as trying to find a needle in the ocean, but a group of people, of course, with poor folks accounting for the vast majority, are unwilling to give up this faint hope. Every time I see people being so enthusiastic, I simply don't believe that society is in decline. To speculate about the reason for such contradictions, the answer is probably: "There is no hope that can be better than the hope offered by this kind of illusion in this real society."</p>
<p>You might think that this kind of hope is an expression of extreme individualism? Correct. They spend their hard-earned money, even a few cents extracted from hunger, to make this desperate gamble, which is undoubtedly because they have a great desire to get rich. But on the other hand, there is also a point that is equally worthy of our attention, which is that they want to avenge the dissatisfaction that reality has dealt them, and they also place this attempt at revenge on this illusory hope. Isn't this the secondary condition that pushes them into the hope of destruction?</p>
<p>Isn't that right? I have several friends who bought this "XX lottery ticket." Before the lottery was drawn, they were already preparing to distribute that astonishing sum of ten thousand yuan. One of them wanted to get a few gorgeous women to play with because his wife had run away with a certain young master when he was desperately poor. Another wanted to buy several cars to rush and crash on the streets as a demonstration because he was tired of being bullied by the arrogant cars on the road every day. In short, they hate reality and want to plant some seeds of revenge in the hope of illusion. Very few of them held the idea of settling down and building a career peacefully. It's just a pity that none of my friends won the prize. Such passive expressions are indeed laughably naive.</p>
<p>Of course, apart from the lucky one who gets the sole prize money, there must be millions who are disappointed and sad. But someone said: "We were so happy before the lottery was drawn, dreaming sweet and dense dreams! Although this dream is somewhat empty and illusory, having this kind of empty dream on this tired and mechanical mind all day long is already the supreme glory and comfort." When we ask ourselves whether this kind of Ah Q thinking is right, of course, this kind of "temporary beautiful dream" hope is not a way out either! Because, does the money they exchange with blood and sweat only worth this little price? No, definitely not, then what is our way out?</p>
<p>Doing a good job as someone, accumulating some money bit by bit is the best way out, right? But simply put: in today's society, wanting to accumulate some money is a dream. You are already a lucky person if you can solve the problem of three meals a day. Then what is our way out?</p>
<p>The above two paths are already impassable, so we should find a third path! Let's assume that the above two paths are "dream paths," then the one we want to take now must be "in sobriety." "Sober path" definitely cannot be lying in bed, it should be soberly getting up to find a way out. But after all, it is also a difficult thing! It is like sharp thorns are placed in front of your bed, making you unable to get up. If you sleep down again, it is full of mud, and it will be difficult for you to get up again. Then what is our way out?</p>
<p>But mankind always runs towards the path of survival!</p>

<p>— Ba Yi</p>
<p>In the small advertisements in the newspapers, there are often notices for hiring teachers, especially in the summer during the summer vacation, because the summer vacation is the time for various schools to replace teachers. The psychology of unemployed people is depressed. They feel the sorrow and pain of unemployment, so they desperately look for things to do. Therefore, the recruitment category in these classified advertisements has become a daily necessity for the unemployed. My friend Mr. K was naturally no exception.</p>
<p>One summer evening, I was enjoying the cool in the courtyard when I suddenly heard a burst of very hurried footsteps coming straight towards my house. I looked closely and saw that it was Mr. K. He saw me and said, "There is now an opportunity to be a teacher! This opportunity is what I found in the newspaper, look!" I took the newspaper and looked at it. There was a passage like this:</p>
<p>Our school now plans to hire six teachers. Qualifications: must be a teacher training school graduate. Salary: 30 yuan per month, with room and board provided. Those who are willing to apply should bring their certificates and a registration fee of two yuan to XX Road XX Lane XX Number for contact and registration, and wait for an interview. Those who are suitable will be hired. School.</p>
<p>After reading it, I said to Mr. K, "Although this is an opportunity, you have to be careful. Is it reliable? Don't be slippery? What about the inside story?"</p>
<p>After hearing my words, K said, "I don't care whether they are slippery or not, whether there is an inside story or not. I have been unemployed for a long time. How can I sacrifice this opportunity? Anyway, the registration only costs two yuan. If it's an inside story, then I can only admit that I'm unlucky, like having a disease, right?"</p>
<p>After K finished speaking, he left slightly. After a week, K came again. Seeing his appearance, he was very depressed, not as lively as before. Before I had time to ask him, he said first, "Old friend, I've been tricked! That time's teacher recruitment was indeed an inside story! Slippery! This time when I went to register, a young man in a suit was working in this room. At this time, there were already more than 100 people registered. I also registered according to the law. After two hours, the man in the suit asked me about my resume and hometown, etc. Finally, he said, 'I will notify you after three days.' So I paid two yuan and went back.</p>
<p>After I got home, I waited all day long for the notification. Unexpectedly, after three days, there was no notification. I couldn't help but be suspicious, so I hurriedly went to the registration office to find out what was going on. It was already empty, according to the neighbors, they had moved out the day before yesterday. Old friend, isn't this an inside story? Slippery? I have really been tricked badly."</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I couldn't help but be stunned. I thought silently that it is really difficult for young people to enter the world in this society that is full of darkness and miasma. There are countless traps set up in advance, waiting for young people to step into them, which is really extremely dangerous! Mr. K's deception is still a small matter. However, the bankruptcy of education can also be seen from this. Alas, alas, alas.</p>

<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>(25) "Wavy hair is fine as long as the heart is upright and true. This might give our dull commerce and industry some new stimulus! Good." Wu Ziqing was ultimately more experienced than them, pressing the question deeper: "However, the attitude we adopt externally must be very cautious. Tomorrow, I think… Currently, there are already some rumors about our attitude externally. I think it would be good to have a statement issued by the banking community tomorrow denying everything!"</p>
<p>"Alright!" Yang Jiefu breathed a sigh of relief. "Yishan, let's arrange a tea dance party at your place the day after tomorrow. Let's get some of our colleagues together to sound out their opinions."</p>
<p>It was only ten o'clock, and each of them had plenty of time to pick his favorite concubine and enjoy the second half of the night for an hour or two.</p>
<p>Wang Hua was too much in the limelight. Now he went to every meeting, and whenever he did, he would speak, and whenever he spoke, he would talk about saving the country, and whenever he saved the country, it was always greatly beneficial to him.</p>
<p>Everyone said Wang Hua was an active member, a capable man, but everyone despised his lack of knowledge and his base character. He became the subject of conversation for many people, which he took as a source of honor. He believed that being qualified to be talked about proved that he was not born silent and odorless, and even if someone scolded him, it was just jealousy. But no one dared to offend him, and that was something he could certainly be proud of. Wasn't it true that no one had ever exposed the many dark deeds he had done? Here, there was yet another one of them. Ever since he had Professor Li rope in a group of famous Shanghai celebrities to collect donations for national salvation, he had indeed received a thousand responses to his call, gathering fur (?), to make a robe. But this fur was torn from the bodies of poor people. Some reduced their meals, going hungry to save a few dimes, some lengthened their working hours to earn a few extra cents, women specially knitted a pair of socks as a donation, and even children would save their candy money to donate. Their achievements were wildly praised in the newspapers, as if they were about to lead a national mobilization of the people. In order to encourage the people to continue to donate, they often held large-scale gatherings to celebrate the generals of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. One day, it was reported that a representative of a certain Northeast Volunteer Army had come to Shanghai to seek assistance, and would attend a reception hosted by the Anti-X X X X Organizations Joint Association to report on the anti-Japanese situation. The name of this representative X X X X sounded unfamiliar, but most of the generals and soldiers of the Northeast Volunteer Army were grassroots heroes who rose up spontaneously, and it was common for their names to be unknown to the people of the country. As long as they raised the banner of resistance against Japan, their compatriots would sympathize with them unconditionally. Therefore, the reception held by the X X X X Organizations Joint Association was very popular, with many eager to participate. Hu Yuan announced the opening of the meeting, followed by the chairman I the chairman was of course our hard-working Brother Hua eating I introducing the resume of the said Volunteer Army representative.</p>
