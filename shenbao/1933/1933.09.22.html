<p>時評</p>
<h3>我國之農村經濟恐慌　明</h3>
<p>（五畝之宅。樹之以桑。……百畝之田。勿奪其時。……）爲我國古時最高遠之政治思想。亦即一般人所憧憬之太平盛世。現時我社會組織之基。礎雖已發生變更。但此種思想。仍具有甚大之支配力。蓋以農業經營。依舊爲我國生產之主要根源。農民人數。至少占全人口百分之七十以上。是以市面繁榮之底力。社會榮枯之闗鍵。亦即在此農村之盛衰也。</p>
<p>今日遍全國各地之農村。自南至北。莫不有岌岌不可終日之勢。吾人試推考其所以衰落至此之原因。確非簡短篇幅所能盡述。但歸納要點。一爲政局不安定。自滿清末葉以來。官吏多貪污。國家課稅。日益加重。復多非法剥削。於是農民遂日陷於疲困。二爲經濟上弱點。我國一般生產。迄今仍以手工業爲主。故難與資本主義諸國相角逐。而農村間一切事業。復外受廉價商品輸入之侵蝕。内被高利借貸與法外捐稅之敲剥。雖安分守己終歳勤動之農。民亦將不能自存。農村旣日見敗壞。則中小城市。亦直接受其影響。乃演成今日國民經濟動摇之危局矣。</p>
<p>此次世界經濟恐慌。時問旣延長。且又遍佈於各國。我國雖經濟落後。但亦不能避免此嚴重之影響。故一切農村副業。莫不遭受巨大之打擊。例如蠶絲。因絲價大跌。致養蠶之家。無法歸還葉價。本年三月後。生絲在海外雖略有消路。而美國生絲市塲爲日本所奪。於是中國之絲。業亦遂一蹶不振。茶葉亦然。以今年一月以來之狀况。與去年同時期較。對外輸出。低落之數。達國幣四百萬元以上。其他如皮革。如鷄蛋。等類。亦皆到處屯積無。法消納。則農村經濟之敗壞。可不言而喻矣。</p>
<p>農業生產之基礎。乃建立於土地之上。此等土地。尤爲業農者之實際目的。我國農業之一般情况。在北方出產。以小麥爲主。在長江流域。則以米爲大宗。照通常理論。我國應有餘米麥輸出。然而事實上除東北三省所產大豆有巨量輸出外。闗於米麥兩項。非特無輸出。且反大宗輸入。我國輸入洋米。據海闗報告。去年一年中計有二千二百四十餘萬担。價值一萬萬金單位以。上今年過去八個月中。輸入洋米一千六百七十萬担。價值六千二百三十三萬金單位。去年一年輸入小麥一千五百餘萬担。價值四千三百餘萬金單位。今年一月至八月。小麥輸入一千七百三十萬担。價值四千四百十萬金單位。據上述數字以觀。我國工業都市。如上海如漢口如廣州如平津之類。均須完全仰給於外國之食料。以號稱以農立國之古國。而竟有此現象。是何以故。長江流域。去年大都豐收。殺價迄未高漲。甚且不能維持最低限度符合於生產費之價格。又何以故。雖然。此不難以一言解答之也。即外有列國之肆行傾消。内因交通阻滯。捐稅奇重。致米穀存積於原產地。即賤價亦無市塲可以消售。且内地金融緊急。無形中貨幣價值抬高。農產物遂感受莫大之厄運耳。</p>
<p>今後更生之道。一方面免除一切苛稅雜捐。換言之即廢除間接稅制而代以直接稅制。一方面嚴禁軍隊擾害農村。而豪紳地主之高利盤剥。尤須加以取締。并積極建設農民信用合作社。使農村金融。有週轉之餘地。努力行之不懈。則三數年後。或有挽回危局另闢新途之望也。</p>

<h3>水退拆缷各件</h3>
<p>沈際雲抵涪州张、會同船主吉慶榮　　及重慶分局長進行打撈方策、乃向民生公司租定一輪、並雇用大批工人到平泉灘先駁去貨物、嗣後上游江水大退、峨嵋輪變成高擱在灘岸石叢中、當時總以爲年内無法救出、必待來春漲水、方可打撈、故已令工人將船内各項裝置建築物、一律拆缷、乘落水時將船邊礁石毁除、然後修補破洞、又用小輪在上月二十號後江水二次大漲時、將峨嵋前船身强從砂灘泥中扶托而起、使之平浮、經八星期之工程、始告成功、</p>
<h3>電告救護成功</h3>
<p>此兩個月中、局内所用之峨嵋輪救護費及種種之工事費用、先後支付匯往、巳達八萬數千元之巨、現在船身業於本月十八日從亂礁石中救出、已浮平江面、船内拆下之物件中、先將無線電一架裝就、已於昨日與滬臺通電、而據沈際雲報告、謂峨嵋打撈成功、則日出淺、一俟引入江中、便即拖還上海、入塢大修、劉總經理得此電報、十分喜悅、以無法救護之船、竟得安然救出、殊出意料之外、現俟稍予裝置、便令拖滬大修、</p>
<h3>開航京漢快班</h3>
<p>峨嵋船身載重一千零七十六噸、係一九二○年在江南廠建造、機器極佳、有三千匹馬力、每小時可行十三海哩、爲江輪中第一速快之船、原行宜昌重慶一路、近來滬上之重慶直放船日多、川河航業巳成弩末、該局上次派員考察長江航業結果、以京漢一路近來頭等旅客往來日多、較前數年之形勢不同、苟將峨嵋輪改航京漢直放特别快班、兩天内可從南京到漢口、則營業必十分發達、而亦爲長江船内開一速快航輪之新紀元、劉鴻生巳將此議决定、俟此次峨嵋還滬大修之後、即行開航、業將添闢此新路理由情形、呈報理事會核准後、轉達交通部矣、此亦長江航輪界特殊情形也、</p>

<h3>丨盜名李阿新旋解總局丨</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時許、南市十六舖太平衖鹽碼頭大碼頭外馬路楊家渡街裹馬路一帶、忽然發現槍聲、密如連珠、且槍聲起處、但見一區區長　鞏、率領大批長警究捕一劇盜、路人見狀、均四散逃逸、一時各馬路間秩序大亂、記者聞訊、急駕事前往詳加調查之下、始悉有一劇盜、身懷手槍兩支、至大碼頭擬附搭寛豐輪船、當爲警士發覺、意欲上前逮捕、該盜卽返身奔逃、沿途並開槍拒捕、以致擊傷路人兩名、警士一名、該盜右腿亦由警擊中一槍、仍舊捨命奔逃、直至恒興東里東口外馬路、始爲警士捕獲、茲將調查所得、詳情分誌於後、</p>
<h3>碼頭檢查</h3>
<p>昨日下午五時許、有一男子、年約二十餘歳、身穿藍布短衫褲、步至南市大碼頭第八號碼頭、正圖步登停泊在該處之寳豐輪船、時有該管一區總署警士張鎰·李興旺兩人、在該處檢查旅客、當見該男子形跡鬼崇、情殊可疑、遂卽上前喝令停步、正圖搜檢時、不料該男子竟返身奔逃警等意料其人决非善類、乃亦拔步追趕、</p>
<h3>情急開槍</h3>
<p>該男子從碼頭間奔上大碼頭外馬路時、該處第五崗守望警楊友松見狀、卽上前攔住去路、正擬逮捕、該男子情急、卽從身畔掏出手槍一支、向楊警當胸開放一槍、楊警將身軀一閃、該彈遂在其右畔衣袖上穿過、擊成兩洞、所幸未曾受傷、該男子復乘間從大碼頭街向西逃入裹馬路、此時警等亦卽拔出手槍向前頻追頻擊、</p>
<h3>三警協拿</h3>
<p>其時適一區巡邏警廉景雲·方錫五·聶盛嶺等、適亦行經該處、瞥見情狀、立卽會同警士張鎰等上前追趕、並各出所佩手槍、向盜轟擊、該盜遂由裹馬路向北逃至楊家渡街口、卽向西折入楊家渡街、沿途目逃且返身開槍向警還擊、同時一區區長　鞏、已得警報、立卽親率巡官警士十餘名、全體武裝、馳往兜拿、</p>
<h3>劇盜中彈</h3>
<p>該盜遂從楊家渡街向北逃入楊家渡横街、再向東逃回裹馬路、直達鹽碼頭街、轉身向北、逃至增祥衖口、闗區長等仍跟踪奮勇追去、該盜遂又折入增祥衖、逃回外馬路、適有市公安局水巡隊稽查員朱潤身、行經該處、見狀亦卽加入追趕、並開槍向盜射擊、該盜乃再沿外馬路向北逃至太平衖口、此時其右腿上已被警等射中一槍、惟仍負傷亡命向西逃進太平衖、</p>
<h3>出第二槍</h3>
<p>且因手上所執手槍之膛内九粒子彈、已經放完、遂從身畔再掏出第二支手槍、形如瘋癲、向後面追趕之警士亂射、惟闗區長仍率警努力向前追趕、並開槍轟　、時該處太平衖口第四崗守望警許鳳崗、見狀亦卽恊同追趕、該　乃從太平衖再行向西逃入　　路、　　至十六舖東門路相近之恒興東　西口、該處第九崗守望警焦德增見狀、亦跟同追捕、詎該盜再行返身向東逃進恒興東里、直向外馬路方面衝去、</p>
<h3>張警受傷</h3>
<p>斯時適　該區巡　警張萬發、行經該星東口、突見該盜從該里西口向東逃來、張警卽從身畔掏出手槍、把守該里東口、迨該盜逃近身旁、正擬上前截捕時、詎料該盜竟向張警開放一槍、張警不及閃避、致被擊中左腿、子彈當場穿出、鮮血隨之直流、在此一刹那間、該盜已越過張警身畔、逃至外馬路、</p>
<h3>仆地就擒</h3>
<p>惟該盜斯時已逃竄得筋疲力盡、氣喘如牛、且右腿所中一槍、子彈未曾穿出、血流過多、已痛極難忍、故逃未數武、卽行仆地、而受傷之警士張萬發、亦負痛追來、該盜見狀復再拚命從地上躍起、返轉身軀、正圖開槍向張警作二次射擊時、但張警至此、亦已不顧一切、奮勇趨前將盜身攔腰抱住、始得將該劇盜擒獲、</p>
<h3>奪下兩槍</h3>
<p>同時　區長等亦巳趕到、遂在盜之手上奪下手槍兩支、其中一支子彈早已放完、卽復將實彈槍檢視、膛内所有子彈九粒、僅剩兩粒、當因該盜及警士張萬發均已受傷、遂送入中國紅十字會南市醫院、當由該院醫生張劍雄·黄啟祥等、先將張警傷處敷藥包紮畢、張警卽自回區中療養、一面施用手術、將該盜右腿上所中子彈、設法取出、再行敷藥包紮畢事、由警等帶回區署、</p>
<h3>名李阿新</h3>
<p>當由開區長帶案預審、據供名李阿新、年二十六歳、崇明人、惟對於携帶手槍兩支之用意、則不肯吐露、直至再三嚴詰、始供　向在滬西靜安寺地方某工廠内作工、近有同廠工作之施阿二、於前日（十九）下午將此項手槍兩支、託我帶往堡鎭、並給我大洋十元、以作盤費、我乃於今天携帶手槍來至大碼頭、意圖附搭　豐輪起程、惟施阿二則先往堡鎭等候、與我聚首後共做買賣、不期被警在碼頭上睹破、以致被捕云云、當以該盜槍法純熟、胆大已極、必係富有經騐之劇盜無疑、卽飭備文申解市公安局、從嚴澈究、</p>
<h3>流彈傷人</h3>
<p>當警上等追捕該盜時、一路上該盜開槍拒捕、而警士等亦開槍射擊、以致所經大碼頭、楊家渡街、外馬路、鹽碼頭、裹馬路、增祥弄、太平弄、恒興里一帶、子彈横飛、路上行人見狀、恐怖四散、一時秩序大亂、當有海門人周洪凡（年二十七歳、）向爲鐵匠、家居楊樹浦、爲流彈擦傷右背、尙有六馬路中國工商套鞋廠工人通州人吳耀明、亦爲流彈從其右背射入、該兩人經由警士車送南市醫院、亦由醫師張劍雄等在周之傷處敷藥包紮後、因傷勢甚微、故卽出院返家、惟吳耀明則經施用手術、將右臂上所中子彈鉗出後、留院療養、聞傷勢如無變化、可無性命之憂、</p>

<h3>吳達銓演講統制經濟問題</h3>
<p>應銀行學會之請</p>
<p>詳析其内容要素</p>
<p>銀行學會於前日下午七時、假座四川路青年會大禮堂、請鹽業銀行經理吳達銓氏演講統制經濟問題、到會聽講者有各銀行男女職員、及穆藕初、陳彬龢、等共六百餘人、由浙江興業銀行總經理徐新六主席、介紹吳氏後、即由吳氏演講、分析統制經濟之要素及歷史意義之不同、歷一小時許、茲誌其要點如下、</p>
<h3>經濟主義</h3>
<p>統制經濟一名詞、近數年來、風靡全球時以歐美各國生產過剩經濟發生恐慌、而蘇聯五年計劃、逐步進展、相形之下、相繼以統制經濟爲挽救之良方、今先分析其原素、約有四端、（一）在某種經濟主義之下計劃、如共產主義之於蘇聯、法西主義之於意大利、统制經濟之内容、各異其趣、實施統計經濟時、必先本其立國之經濟主義以從事、萬不能從事抄襲、有人因俄之五年計劃成功、以爲統制經濟、僅適用於共產主義之下、此實錯誤、蓋蘇聯共產主義愅命在一九一七年而統制經濟之發生、向在一九二九年、並無若何不可分離之聯繫也在、（二）在某種目的之下計劃者、如國防經濟、一切經濟建議、均以完成國防爲目的、其他如戰爭經濟、提高生產、或如歐美資本主義國家之以求生產與消費平衡、皆各有其從事統制之目的、</p>
<h3>統制力量</h3>
<p>（三）施行時以何種力量統制之、卽統制者之力量、必須能使全國一致遵照行動、如蘇聯僅組織　委會　主持之、在意大利則必規定多數委員爲勞資兩方之同數代表及少數自由職業智識份子組織之、倘在英國、則必基於職業團體、在美國則必由於國會授權、在日本嵵必聯合　部及財閥、始能發揮其力量、返語我國、則因相沿成習、僅用個人統制經濟、而無團體統制之素養、地域之見旣未泯、而職業團體亦力量薄弱、罕有能使團體成絶對遵守其决定者、以言統制力量、尙　測定也</p>
<h3>經濟組織</h3>
<p>（四）在某種經濟組織中計劃者、統制經濟必先根據本國之原有經濟組織、資本主義之國與共產主義之國家、旣相迴别、卽生產過剩之國家與生產落後國家、工業國家與農業國家、均各異其趣、因統制經濟因能與原有經濟組織予以若干影　、而使之稍稍變易、然不能以之打破固有之經濟組織也、蓋打破經濟組織、而另建新組織者、爲經濟主義而非統制經濟也、</p>
<h3>三個要素</h3>
<p>統制經濟之名詞、雖起於一九二八·一九二九年間、其事實則古巳有之、如我國古時之　仲治齊、商鞅治秦、及王安石之新法、皆有相當經濟政策、横証他國、其例尤多、近代史中、如歐戰時各國、東起俄國西至美國莫不實施戰時經濟、亦卽統制經濟也、不過與現在統制經濟事說、不全相同、現在統制經濟其所以異於往昔者、有下列三要素、（一）有系統計劃而非片斷的、（二）不是臨時的、是平時的、（三）不止消極的、尙有積極的、</p>
<h3>糾正譯名</h3>
<p>最後、吳氏謂統制經濟之原名、本爲計劃經濟、卽有整個經濟計劃、而全國遵以從事、以别於自由放任主義之致生產無政府狀况者、本無甚高深之涵義、自日本人譯爲統制經濟後、頗多引人誤解、至吾國實行統制經濟、本人在學理上　條件贊成、但在事實上則不敢貿然發言、統制經濟完全　事實之需要、故必視經濟建設之計劃之是否適合環培需要與能力而定其是非優劣也、</p>

<h3>性聖到那裹去了</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>張競生一經自稱性聖便惹出了一場滔天大禍，民廳長林翼中，電令新任饒平縣長陸桂芳把他拘拿到省懲辦。一時傳說紛紛，有云：一張氏巳被饒平縣長扣留的。）有云：（張氏已離饒平，赴汕頭，在汕，被汕市長扣留，不日卽須解省重懲的。）還有神經過敏之談，據說：（張氏巳遭不測，想做性聖，却不料斷送了性命。）</p>
<p>聖人會得被人扣留麽？聖人會得死於非命麽？我對於以上的消息，却認爲不大正確。假使，聖人眞個因扣留而死於非命，那麽，聖人發明了第三種水，再也不能發明第四種水，性學不要失傳了麽？我想自稱性聖的張競生，一定有逢凶化吉遇難成祥的本領，（天生德於予，饒平人其如予何？）張競生大概可以自豪吧。</p>
<p>果然，在饒平被縣長扣留的消息不確，在汕頭被市長扣留的消息，也不確。有陸縣長的電報爲憑：（各公安局各區公所均鑒：本縣實業督辦張競生，奉民政廳電飭查拿解省聽候查辦，當卽飭派丁小隊長前往拘拿未獲，自應通緝歸案，以憑轉解，合亟令飭遵照，一體恊緝，務獲解辦，毋稍玩忽爲要。縣長陸，養。）照這麽說，通緝雖然緊急，性聖早和齊天大聖一般，一個觔斗雲，不知翻到那裹去了？也許翻到女兒國裹，和伊们實騐性學去了。</p>
<p>最近，有人替張競生平反控案，只爲控告張氏十大罪狀的饒平旅汕改進社，是一種未經立案的結社，顯係違法組織，所有控案，類同匿名揭帖，不應發生效力。張氏任饒平實業督辦後、築成饒錢公路七十餘里，有相當的成效。應請將張氏緝案取銷，恢復實業督辦，云云。唉！聖人不死，性學重光，一輩控告聖人的饒平旅汕社，只怕要律以反坐，辦他们一個（非聖無法一的罪名吧。</p>
<h3>徐樂卿臨死之豪語</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>大概都市越熱鬧，姦盜劫掠等事越發達，譬如上海一埠，雖說是（東方的巴黎，）其實盜匪猖獗，不亞於美國的紐約。我们窮光蛋，因爲農村破產，只得跑到都市上來抓錢。所奇的一班富翁，都戀着這個（東方的巴黎），不願意到鄉間去享板橋茆店，灘影嵐光的天然風景，情情願願在棘地荆天中度生活，眞是一椿奇事！</p>
<p>最近吾鄉徐君樂卿，在海格路被綁，因抵抗飲彈而死。外間不知道徐君之爲人，紀載很多失實。在下把客觀的眼光，略述徐君的生平，也許徐君死而瞑目吧。徐君以紗業起家，性精細而寡言笑，思想頗新，言論也誠懇。對於敎育，尤具熱心，吾鄉有貧民小學二所，名曰普迪，出費不下萬餘元。而平日談吐的時候，似乎尙有辦學的志願：所以說他鄙吝，委實寃哉枉也啊。但他對於私人的帮忙，似乎不大情願的，他以爲一個人終要自己奮鬥，賙濟翻足以隳志而養惰，這很合英國大小說家科南達利所著的（電影樓臺）了。但鎭年仰他舉火的，也不下若干人；所以他的性質，也不能說是鄙吝。</p>
<p>他這次被匪所綁，竟敢把手中的錢袋，和匪抵抗；在别的富翁，不是早已做了匪窟中入幕之賓嗎？海格路紅十字會醫院，把他腹中彈子取出以後，他神志很清，言語響亮，常要找人講話，說：（綁匪的横行，流毒於社會，都是綁去即贖的緣故，試看日本何以綁匪絶跡，便可以明白了。所以我情願和他抵抗，不願被他綁去。）家屬勸他少說話，醫生是闗照過的。他莞爾道：（死是另一問題，四大臭皮囊，何足介懷。）這樣說來，他的性質，思想，也可以略知梗概了。</p>
<p>話要說回來了，古人說：（謾藏誨盜。）又說：（象以齒而焚身。）蒙莊把樗樹不材而不爲匠人斫，來比喻（明哲保身）之道。一般富翁们，也可以恍然了！</p>
<h3>二十萬女人</h3>
<p>— 沈馨</p>
<p>新近，有一個從事西醫的朋友告訴我：上海有二十萬賣淫的女人，裹面分長三，么二，野鷄，私娼。現在不要以爲這個數目符否，單先來講講這二十萬女人。第一，二十萬女人，可以說是，十九萬九千九百九十九個是含着毒菌，因爲毒菌的發源，並不是先天傳得，是從交合的不清潔而來：或不當心而來。然而，做了個賣淫的女人，又不能講究清潔，旣不能講究當心，於是每個女人，免不了含些毒菌。</p>
<p>第二，有這二十萬有了毒的女人，那麽，平均每個女人，可以接五個男子，可以拿毒菌傳給五個男子論，就有一百萬男子被害皮膚中含有毒的，再由這一百萬男子，傳受給每個妻子。跟着，又有一百萬女人含着毒質；這樣，有二百二十萬是含毒菌的男女。</p>
<p>單從這二個題目上說，上海的一埠就要有二百二十萬，實地含着毒的男女。再推開想起，統計全中國的男女，就有四分之一是含着毒的。假如一年一年過下去，一年一年由男的傳給女的。由女的傳給男的。由老的傳給小的。將來，很容易成爲通國皆毒。</p>
<p>但回轉來說，二十萬女人，也是没奈何的墮落。不過，我们的政府，應當負一些責任，二十萬女人該怎樣處置。二十萬女人該怎樣使伊们脫離毒菌。二十萬女人該怎樣救濟。不要讓一九五○年的中國，一變而爲花柳毒國。</p>
<p>鄉，立志終老於是鄉。</p>
<p>前一種牢獄的監禁，是有限止的，還得自己在憬悟下努力推翻的；後一種牢獄的監禁，不但伊於胡底，而且永恒會把姑娘迷戀着，至死不悟。所以，前一種牢獄的監禁，縱給努力推翻了，未見得便可喜；後一種牢獄的相繼入内，相繼自願地被長期監禁，才覺其大可悲！不過，話說回頭，姑娘们的心理，到底是要推翻牢獄似的生活的，何况還有令人敢佩的决心和毅力；伊们所以會入另一牢獄，會永恒迷戀，這實在是另一牢獄的建造在競爭，範圍在擴展，把姑娘们固有的立足地逐漸侵略而至於狹窄的轉不得身，况又非常的富於誘惑性，麻醉性，姑娘们處在這一種環竟下，怎麽不要不知不覺地跌入牢門？而被長期監禁！</p>
<p>因此，我们該予注意的，不在於姑娘们的所以會跌入牢門，而在於怎樣會使姑娘们跌入牢門者？</p>
<p>科學趣</p>
<h3>姑娘们的牢獄</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>自由，解放，女連，女權，這是姑娘们在再接再厲下努力的唱；努力的趕的。無疑的，姑娘们要爭自由，解放，至少是感受了不自由和束缚的苦痛：要擴大女運，提高女權，也至少覺得了女子權能並地位的銷沉和没落。這就好有一些，好比平白發生了件寃案，無端給被監禁在牢獄的人们，他们常常在想平反，雪寃，或大聲呼籲，或索性在打算怎樣達到越獄的目的。</p>
<p>可見監禁在牢獄中而想脫離，恢復，這原是人之恒情，也正如感受不自由和束縛的苦痛要自由、解放，覺得女子權能並地位的銷沉和没落要擴大女運，提高女權一般的可得普遍的同情。</p>
<p>然而，事實，所告訴我们的，却偏有絶大的矛盾，姑娘们一面是在努力推翻這一牢獄似的生活，一面却又向着另一牢獄合羣地跑，躱，鑽，跑到了，躱進了，鑽入了，莫說永遠不會自動的退出，就是有人特地去導引伊们别走光明之路，伊们也要絶端的加以拒絶。伊们整天價穿着鮮艶的牢衣，吃着豐盛的牢飯，趕着笑啊，跳啊，唱啊，肉啊的牢獄工作，過着愛啊，嫁啊離啊，訟啊的牢獄歳月，總之，伊们實已認做這是安樂</p>
<h3>東北連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>但此來並不是專門要剌探桂枝的什麽消息，只因那次蒙趙連長到會館裹來相訪，介紹自己到大紅門來敎書，雖是　　錢不多，但是憑了本事掙錢，這總是一件光明而又痛快的事情。自從得了這個位置而後，整日的埋頭工作，並不曾來向趙自强道謝，這是不對的。所以這一次來海甸來，最大的目標，還是來謝趙自强。他怱怱的走來，直奔西苑大營，却不曾加以考量。直至望到了大樓，自己却忽然省悟過來。心想此來未免錯了。請问，並不知道他是好一團那一營，這樣大的地方，怎樣去找一個趙自强連長。若說回海甸他家裹去面謝他老太爺，本來也是一樣。然而他家是和楊家住在一個大門裹的。讓自己向楊家看臉色去，却也是不願的事。想來想去，憑了自己在海甸居住有時的經騐，知道去西苑不遠的那兩條街上，有兩家酒飯館子，常有些下級軍官出入。自己肚子餓了，何不到一家吃點東西，順便探探趙自强的消息。或者探聽得出來，也未可知。他如此想着，就緩緩的走着。這已是四月裹的天氣，店舖子裹把窗台板和格扇都缷除了，由外面看到裹面的散座。積之還不曾進門去呢，在裹面一個抹桌子的店伙，早就笑着點頭迎道：甘二爺，短見啦，您一向在那兒發財？積之笑着走了進去道：你倒還認識我。店伙道：雅座裹去吧？（一九三）</p>
<h3>颶風行結婚禮</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>（颶風）一名詞，亦呌（颶風，南越志一書說一颶風）具四方之風也，常發於五六月間，投荒雜錄，說（嶺南諸郡皆有颶風，以風由四面俱至也，）昔人或作（臺風），因爲這風最多在臺灣，所以西人呼爲（地風），大約就是（臺風）的轉音，也未可知：總之這一種的風勢猛烈可怖，不但在洋海中。巨艦遇到，要毁蓬折檣，而在陸地上，也要拔大木，倒鉅厦，受他風力的侵害，眞比其他水火的力量，不知要强到幾萬倍哩！</p>
<p>（颶風）的方向，眞是奇怪，他不由一直徑，乃偏偏在空際大小不等的當中，從那四邊廻旋，於是這一個中間，天文家就呌他是圜心），因爲這一來，凡在赤道北半球的（颶風），凑集在國心的時候，就有一個比例，好像時計面上的指針，恰在倒行一般，什麽緣故呢？他的進行，就是由南而東，而北，而西，而南，這不是一個顯著的例證麽？第一次的（颶風），到了上海還不久，不料第二次又蒙光臨，并且代他稱道一聲（燕爾之喜），某報說是一行近温州東部之颶風，與十八晨在台灣之南部海面發現之颶風，相距僅二百五十英里，二風或再會合，行結婚禮於某處，亦未可知　，這種推測和論調，的確是記事的極好筆法，使人看了，拿觸目驚心的險象，一變而成爲待闕鴛鴦的最旖旎最艶屬的資料，確是記載（風位）以來一個破天荒的嶄新題目，足以令人十分注意了！</p>
<p>不過吾们古書裹，亦載有許多風的名詞，就是易經上說，（撓萬物者莫疾乎風一一句，也是（颶風）的一例，尙書載（納於大麓，烈風雷雨弗迷，）春秋有（六鷁退飛，過宋都，風也）之事，都是風的權威，所以記之特详，然而風的本身，從未拿來判晰過，風土記云，（六月有東南長風，俗名（黄雀風），然因海裹的魚變爲黄雀而名，而雀亦並不明言其性别，又攷圖經，有（海道之險，曰（疾風，）（黑風，）痴風之作，連日怒號不巳，四方莫辨，黑風一起，則天地晦冥，不分晝夜，）然但說風的不正，風的糊亂，總没有講到風的戀愛，就是（雄風）兩字，也當王者一時的吐氣，而不是眞箇風爲丈夫，倘然風眞有雄，何以找不出一個（雌風）來當他配偶呢？</p>
<p>現在，那末有了現成的典實，凡遇（颶風過境，大家可以明白這一位（風伯），在那裹結婚，又到上海度他的蜜月旅行的樂事，可惜吾们一二八大兵之後，繼以凶年，眼前秋汛將至，弄潮兒不知能否不作惡，尙未可卜，而先有你倆兩度的雙雙携手以降，好像刮喇刮喇聽得似鼓樂喧闐的在天空中笑語着（吾愛啊）？不曉得大地上正坍墻倒屋，偃禾拔木，不轉瞬而蕩滌凈盡，呌苦連天·哭泣的聲音，就在這風中隠隠的可聞啊！</p>

<h3>市長致詞</h3>
<p>開幕典禮於二時舉行、先由全體運動員繞塲一週、繼由吳市長致開幕詞、略謂今天是上海市第三屆全市運動會、運動會在中國有很重大意義避國有數千年歷史、有四萬萬人民、有世界十二分之一大的土地、自歐風東漸、百餘年來、民族地位、遂日益低落、溯其原因、實以我國當閉闗自守時代、歐洲文明已超過中國、而中國文化不能創造、同時消失自信能力、故不能與人比較、總理指導我们要實行民族主義、復興中華民族、在消極方面抵抗外來民族之壓迫、積極方面要努力身心運動、才能使中華民族復興强盛、凡一民族一定要有共同信仰、此信仰爲整個民族之中心思想、此卽心的運動、至身的運動、卽鍜鍊身體、造成健全的國民、擔負國家大任、如全國人民都能瞭解此義、努力做去、中華民族不難復興、運動會在歐洲是很平常的一回事、而在中國則有很深刻的意義、希望各運動員瞭解此意義云、</p>
<h3>代表演說</h3>
<p>繼市黨部代表蔡洪田演說、略謂、本市第三屆運動會中要選拔人才參加、全國運動會、諸位運動員要表演好的成績、將來爲本市爭光、但這不是眞正宗旨、運動會不是爲競賽而舉行的、優勝者雖有奬品、此不過表示紀念而已、其眞正意義在各位運動員注意平日成績、同時漸謀改進、故此次運動會要和過去一二屆比較、以測騐其是否有進步、希望各運動員卽在非運動會時、仍應努力、以强身救國云、</p>

<p>八磅鉛球　馬　驥　孟健麗　阮慧元　徐文英　九米八二（全國新）</p>
<p>標　槍　陳榮明　甘洪英　孫　琤　陳聚才　二七米七五（全國新）</p>
<p>跳　高　鄒善德　李實惠　王化昌　黄佩珩　一米二八</p>
<p>厚望、今日將與程郝二君、爭奪百米冠軍、</p>
<p>▲男二百米預賽　中欄預賽完畢、卽舉行二百米預賽、故程金冠遥頭嘆息不止、預賽本分四組、不意點名時、缺席者多至十三人、故併爲兩組、此種精神、何以常在全市運動會中發現、眞令人莫解、預賽結果、程金冠宿笑如分得兩組冠軍、</p>
<p>▲男四百米預賽　萬目暌暌滬上著名中距選手董叔昭、竟放棄四百米預選、養精蓄銳、預備一千五百米奪標、故第二組預賽選手、無不喜氣洋洋、以爲勁敵一去、可增加錄取機會、孰料殺出程咬金李延祥冷門獨出、以五十三秒五分之特殊成績、壓倒老將闗長發實爲難能可貴、今日决賽中、此公當與曾榮忠、拚個你死我活、</p>
<p>▲高欄預賽　高欄一項、在田徑運動中、可稱難乎其難、最不易有進步、故數年來、滬上大小運動會中、高欄一項常爲曹裕、蕭鼎華·陳陵·陳嘉佑·先後占據、無問鼎者久之、此項新人才、實屬難產、昨日預賽、此四人、仍列前茅、成績亦無長進、仍令人失望、</p>
<p>▲中欄預賽　田徑場四百米跑道、僅有五線、故常於中欄預賽及複賽時、錄取名次、發生困難、如僅有六人參加、亦須分兩組預賽、旣分兩組預選、又不能錄取同樣名次、旣有困難、不感不便、希恊進會設法補救、將四百米跑道放闊一米以免將來困難、昨日預賽、本分三組、幸點名時、僅到九人、分兩組預賽、不然又將增添許多麻煩、預賽結果、第一組成績平平、第二組陶英傑、又以六十秒平等自身於一九三二年在上海萬國運動會所造之全國全紀、但今日决賽中、陶君勁敵不少、程金冠、陳陵、均有探取是項鍾標之野心、故記者以爲陶君今日决賽未可以爲樂觀也、</p>
<p>▲女五十米預賽　中國女子體育較已往確已進步不少、但仍缺少訓練、觀昨日參加徑賽之女選手、除少數體育畢校之女生外、餘都缺少訓練手之姿勢　脚之角度、跑穴之掘法、全不合法、基本工作如此、技術上之訓練、又可想而知、三組預賽結果、以陳淑卿之成绩爲最佳、姿勢亦優、此項錦標、恐非此君莫屬、李實惠步伐雖大、但手之擺動、極宜改良、否則絶無登峯造極之望、蕭傑英身材適中、爲短跑之良材、宜努力練習、</p>
<p>▲女百米預賽　於各項沉悶之預賽中、錢行素小姐以十三秒五之特殊成績、破孫桂雲保持經年之十三秒六三全國紀錄、爲我滬上女子揚眉吐氣、惟此項紀錄、須再加以研究、因發令記時、均有密切之闗係、</p>
<p>▲女二百米預賽　預賽共分兩組、第二組中之李宜南、對於奪標、頗具雄心、故於出發前、備事细心、卽起跑穴、亦由男敎練代掘、極爲週致、槍聲發後、一路與錢行素爭逐、始終相距不盈兩米、結果反使錢行素以二十九秒之優異、成績孫桂雲二十九秒二之全國紀錄、李小姐仍居第二、</p>
<p>（上）女子鉛球破本人全國紀錄之馬驥</p>
<p>（下）女子標槍破全國紀錄之陳榮明</p>
<p>（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>▲女低欄預賽　一盛百盛、以成不可破之公例、連中三元、自古傳爲美談、錢行素小姐、旣破全國纪錄於百米、又造全國紀錄於二百米、再破全國紀錄於低欄、眞是雙喜臨門、三元連中并一刹間、身價十倍、使久問盛名之孫桂雲、反聲名降跌、實是昨日塲中最可紀念之一事、論錢小姐之過欄之姿勢、實與蕭鼎華堪稱伯伸　優美無比、稱之曰巾幗英雄、實不爲過也、</p>
<p>▲一千五百米决賽　出席起跑者共十九人、自第一轉彎後、董叔昭卽領導羣流直至終黯、未能有超過者、惟速度太漫第一圈速度、平日本應以一分鐘爲標準、昨日竟至一分四秒餘、無怪其不能造成優異紀錄、日董君有一最壞習慣、卽於第四圈時、時常回首、因進行賽跑時、回首顧盼、頗易失去平均、易於傾跌、且一經回首、速度定减、卽速度不减、亦不應回顧、蓋回首顧盼、至少有兩種表示、一種表示自己乏力、甚恐後人之追及、一種表示勝利在握、雖左右願盼後人、亦難趕上、此種倣慢之氣、實令人不可忍視、希董君力戒、第二董家爕、昨日始終追隨與叔昭之後、惟步子輕鬆似較往日進步、其缺點亦在第一圈太漫、第三侯德崇、身體之原力頗大、惟步子太小、大腿間之筋帶太緊、以後如能注意此點、當更有進步、</p>

<h3>男女田賽速記</h3>
<p>▲男鐵餅决賽</p>
<p>宫萬育於第二擲得三十五米正之成績、陳寶球於第五擲得三十二米六五、此項决賽爲陳宫二人之爭、先在意料之中、惟昨宫萬育於第二擲突破三十五米綫後、陳寳球似已望塵莫及、每次力擲、均在三十二米左右、第三名爲吳淞商船之羅潛、成績三一米一○、聞此君平素之成績、在三十三四米左右、昨似未能盡展所長、第四名爲東亞之吳掬緒、乃今春全市中學聯運之鐵餅冠軍、綜觀前四名之姿勢、當以宫萬育爲最佳、宫爲纯齋藤式、陳寶球之轉身法、已較前略見進步前二名之成績、均破大會紀錄、</p>
<p>第一名　宫萬育　三十五米正（大會新）</p>
<p>第二名　陳寶球　三十二米六五（大會新）</p>
<p>第三名　羅　潛　三十一米一○</p>
<p>第四名　吳　緒　三十米二三</p>
<p>▲男跳高决賽</p>
<p>昨日各項决賽中、以跳高一項成績最劣、日前大雨、會塲昨猶未乾、尤以跳高之跳區、泥濘鬆軟不堪、臨時敷以細木屑、而得敷衍、各賽員之成绩、無不大受影響、結果跳過一米六七者、有顧彧·凌昭鴻·周世釗·陳天和·吳錦祺等五人、　增二格、五人均未跳過、吳錦祺自願放棄、顧凌周陳四人、乃行低下一格試跳、顧彧聳身一躍而過、餘三人復未跳過、又降低再跳、凌周陳三人、乃先後躍過、名次遂决、惟成績四人完成相同、設若塲地完奸、成績當不止此、茲錄各人之成績如次、</p>
<p>第一名　顧　彧　一米六七</p>
<p>第二名　凌昭鴻　一米六七</p>
<p>第三名　周世釗　一米六七</p>
<p>第上名　陳天和　一米六七</p>
<p>▲男跳遠决賽</p>
<p>跳遠决賽、於暮色蒼茫中舉行、賽前王季淮與吳錦祺二人之呼聲最高、蓋王吳於平素練習時、成績多在六米六十以上至七米、昨日吳於跳高葉權後、跳遠亦未、出塲不免令觀衆大失所望、共有十一人、參加比賽、而跳過六米者只有五人、出人意料之外者、王季淮竟以六米四二之成績、屈居第三、郝春德於第二跳、跳得六米六二、獲得冠軍、王季淮除於第一跳得六米四二之纪錄外、其次每跳輒多犯規、第二名孫惠培於最末一跳、得六米四九、成績中平而已、按孫前在萬國運動會預賽中、曾跳過六米五五、王於萬國運動會時、曾以六米七○五加冠、此次之退步、殊令人莫解、第一名郝春德爲前屈全國運動會跳遠冠軍（六米○一）此次比賽於第五跳曾得六米七二之成績、惜因踏出一釘、而不能作爲正式紀錄、郝之東山再起、前途可欣　茲將前四名决賽紀錄錄下、</p>
<p>第一名　郝春德　六米六二、大會新）</p>
<p>第二名　孫惠培　六米四九（大會新）</p>
<p>第三名　王季淮　六米四二（大會新）</p>
<p>第四名　顧　彧　六米二○</p>
<p>▲女鉛球决賽</p>
<p>昨日參加女子鉛球决賽者、僅有馬驥（子駿）、孟健　、阮慧元、徐文英、張平後、鄒敏等六人、結果　馬孟阮徐四人入選、馬驥於第一擲得九米八二、打破其本人所保持九米三五之全國紀錄、其後每次試擲、均未能及此、第二名孟健麗、於第五擲得八米八九、成績亦極優秀、三四名之阮慧元與徐文英、成績相差極近、亦打破上屆大會韓宛章保持八米十一之紀錄、冠軍馬驥之成績、在全國中可謂獨步、此次全運、女鉛球冠軍、將非馬莫屬、馬自東北事變後、卽肄業本埠江灣東南體師、聞其平素成績、恒在十米以上、此次尙未能盡展其所長、前四名之成績如次、</p>
<p>第一名　馬　驥　九米八二（全國新）</p>
<p>第二名　孟健颶　八米八九（大會新）</p>
<p>第三名　阮慧元　八米六八（大會新）</p>
<p>第四名　徐文英　八米四六（大會新）</p>
<p>▲女標槍决賽</p>
<p>女子標槍决賽、爲昨日大會中最爲生色之一項、前二名均打破全國紀錄、冠軍陳榮明、成績二十七米七五、超出全國紀錄、（黄淑慎保持之二十四米二○五）三米餘、實不可多得、陳擲槍之步伐、姿勢、及速度、均臻上乘、惟最後起擲之一步、尙不十分圓滑純熟、倘能對此稍加注意、當有打破三十米之可能、第二名、甘鴻英之成績、爲二四米八五、亦破全國紀錄、三四兩名、成績亦與全國紀錄接近、將來全國運動會中、女子擲標槍一項、上海恐無敵手、茲錄四人之成績如次、</p>
<p>第一名　陳榮明　二十七米七五（全國新）</p>
<p>第二名　甘鴻英　二十四米八五（全國新）</p>
<p>第三名　孫　琤　二十四米一六（大會新）</p>
<p>第四名　陳聚才　二十三米五八（大會新）</p>
<p>▲女跳高决賽</p>
<p>女子跳高决賽、參加者極形踴躍、多在一米十五左右落選、旣至最後三次之决賽、時已暮色蒼茫、結果人選者爲鄒善德　李寳蕙、王化昌、黄佩珩等四人、四人之成績極爲接近、最後東南之鄒善德與東亞之李寳蕙、爭首次二席、鄒兩跳而過一米二八、李三跳未過、乃屈居第二、第三爲東亞之王化昌、第四爲東南之黄佩珩、成績均在一米二十以上、惜二三四名之成績、均未正式測量、茲錄四人之名次於後、</p>
<p>第一名　鄒善德　一米二八（大會新）</p>
<p>第二名　李實蕙</p>
<p>第三名　王化昌</p>

<h3>東南獲得女子壘球錦標</h3>
<p>昨以十比八勝東亞</p>
<p>市運會女子壘球决賽東南對東亞、昨日上午十時在棒球塲舉行、兩隊實力、不相上下、東亞因塲外同學之呌喊、使球員意志慌張　錯誤疊出、弄巧反成拙、以八比十敗於東南、錦標遂歸東南、第二局上、東亞因接手之失誤、被東南連得六分之多、實爲致命傷、</p>
<h3>第二局意外得失</h3>
<p>東亞先攻開始、無功下塲、東南輪打、任淑首先生還、取得一分、第二局東亞（大漢）孟健　擊一高球、越外塲員而得壘繼而偷至三壘、劉志民放出安打、孟生還、劉亦繼之得一分、東亞乃以二比一佔先、東南輪打、其勢汹汹、每擊必中、三壘均佔、孫琤秦瑞貞相繼得分、後以東亞接手之失漏、又被東南潘月英·徐文英·任淑·鄒善德·先後生還、連得六分之多、東南反以七比二佔優、東亞致敗於斯、</p>
<h3>謀反攻爲時已遲</h3>
<p>第三局各無所獲、第四局東亞一人下塲後東南曾演雙合殺、但裁判因一時慌張、未能辨别陣勢、僅判一人下塲、東亞乃便宜錯得一分、事出於首壘東亞佔有一人、後打者、擊一出界高球、爲接手接住、此打者應下塲、同時首壘上之一人、偷至二壘、（照例不可跑）接手卽將球送之首壘、此跑者亦應下塲、當僅判擊球者下塲耳、是局各得一分、第五局東亞二分、東南零、第六局東亞零、東南二分、總數爲十比五東亞背城决戰、冀謀報復、第七局連得三分之多、但爲時已遲、卒遭敗北、下半局東南因自已得勝、照例無須再賽、東南遂以十比八獲得錦標、東亞　○　二　○　一　二　○　三丨八分局數（一）　（二）　（三）　（四）　（五）　（六）　（七）　Ａ</p>

<h3>兩女英雄特寫</h3>
<p>▲馬驥和陳榮明　馬驥小姐都知道她呌馬子駿、她是遼寗人、起先她也不知道什麽是運動、自從九一八東北失陷後、她感到非鍜鍊身己的體格、是不能對付敵人的、所以她决然地開始運動、當時在北平的宏達中學裡面、可是她每次想練習、終於没有較好機會、去年的秋季、馬小姐和另幾位同學、轉學到上海市的東南體專、考入三年級、於是她得了充分機會、而奮發她應有的天才、這樣不屈不撓的練習、果然發現了她驚人的鐵球鐵餅天才、同時造成了憲想不到的十米五十的鉛球驚人的紀錄、昨日因爲塲地不適合、祇創了九米八十二的全國紀錄、啊、馬小姐給我们特殊的認識、黝色而健美的大腿、孟小姐、阮小姐、徐小姐、也却打破上屆的紀錄、</p>
<p>兩江的陳榮明、不愧是個巾幗英雄、在第一次擲的時候　給東南孫凈小姐很威風的佔了最遠的紀錄、她二點也不怕的　　　聲的緊追、在最後的第二次、果然一槍打破　全國的紀錄、她今年十八歳、在兩江五年級、去年在萬國運動會、曾給白乃特埋没了頭角、所以如今才會奮用出來、她的成績是二十七米七十五、</p>
<h3>女子籃球兩江得决賽權</h3>
<p>▲六四比十分勝夏光</p>
<p>女子籃球昨日複賽之結果、兩江大勝夏光得决賽權、六十四比十分、兩江一直至終、大勝特勝、勢如破竹、夏光毫無抵禦辦法、自陳榮明罰中開紀錄、兩江一連而入、第一節十三比零、夏光於第二節由劉瑪琍罰中三次、莊令昭中的一只、方得五分、上半時爲二十三比五分、下半時仍然如此局面、六十四比十分終局、</p>

<p>混沌初開、未及二分鐘、五區後衛以手觸球、被罰十二碼、二區中堅顧彪、舉足入網、五區多爲上海縣球員、此來抱奪標雄心、旣負一球、怒馬加鞭、施用蘇格蘭式陳線、五前鋒與兩前衛包抄進攻、球常盤旋於二區境内、射門機會、不下十數、俱失之交臂、沈富庚兩次遠射、一次越門而過、一次中注彈回、二區渡過險境、五前鋒聯絡前進、活躍異常、曾有一球已踢至五區門前、五區門將失手仆地、幸動作敏捷、緊抱阿斗於腹中、　向門外擲去始免於難、上半時終了二區以一對○佔先、下半時易地再戰、五區反攻益亟、二區境内滿佈敵騎、時在驚濤駭浪之中、五區右鋒沈富庚於人叢中、對門猛射、李粹挽救未及、只見網窠一動、五區助威者歡聲四起、平等局勢旣成、雙方屢進屢退、演來頗有可觀、未幾、五區又得罰角球機會、挑送二區門前、中鋒顧鏡初頭項入網、反敗爲勝、然不幸事件卽自此發生、雙方明槍暗箭、頗多失檢、二區周承因踢人被罰出塲、最後五分鐘、五區兩次在進門處射球、俱爲李粹仆地、故此笛聲未鳴、五區遂以二對一獲勝、雙方陣綫如下、</p>

<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>禮</h3>
<p>— 索</p>
<p>看報，是有益的，雖然有時也沉悶。例如罷，中國是世界上國恥紀念最多的國家，到這一天，報上照例得有幾塊記載，幾篇文章。但這事情眞也鬧得太重疊，太長久了，就很容易千篇一律，這一回可用，下一回也可用，去年用過了，明年也許還可用，祇要没有新事情。即使有了，成文恐怕也仍然可以用，因爲反正總祗能說這幾句話。所以倘不是健忘的人，就會覺得沉悶，看不出新的啓示來。</p>
<p>然而我還是看。今天偶然看見北京追悼抗日英雄鄧文的記事，首先是報告，其次是演講，最末，是（禮成，奏樂散會。）</p>
<p>我於是得了新的啓示：凡紀念（禮）而已矣。</p>
<p>中國原是（禮義之邦），闗於禮的書，就有三大部，連在外國也譯出了，我眞特别佩服（儀禮）的翻譯者。事君，現在可以不談了；事親，當然要盡孝，但殁後的辦法，則巳歸入祭禮中，各有儀；就是現在的拜忌日，做陰壽之類。新的忌日加添，舊的忌日就淡一點，（新鬼大，故鬼小）也。我们的紀念日也是對於舊的幾個比較的不起勁，而新的幾個之歸於淡漠，則祗好以俟將來，和人家的拜忌辰是一樣的。有人說，中國的國家以家族爲基礎，眞是有識見。</p>
<p>中國又原是（禮讓爲國）的，旣有禮，就必能讓，而愈能讓，禮也就愈繁了。</p>
<p>總之，這一節不說也罷。</p>
<p>古時候，或以黄老治天下，或以孝治天下。現在呢，恐怕是入於以禮治天下的時期了，明乎此，就知道責備民衆的對於紀念日的淡漠是錯的，禮曰：（禮不下庶人）：捨不得物質上的什麽東西也是錯的，孔子不云乎：（賜也爾愛其羊，我愛其禮！）</p>
<p>（非禮勿視，非禮勿聽，非禮勿言，非禮勿動），等着别人的（多行不義，必自斃），禮也。</p>
<h3>李赤與王觀</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>李白，嚇，你是什麽東西？謫仙人！你貴姓李麽？咱老子也姓李。你單名一個白字麽？咱老子就單名一個赤字。你做了翰林麽？咱老子也不失爲一個舉子。你的詩眞是無敵麽？咱老子就是你的敵手。）</p>
<p>像李赤這樣的人，誰都知道他是犯了誇大狂。並非李白眞是一位高不可攀的天才，可是你要攀上他，也得拿出一點貨色來看看呀，單說大話，究竟是可恥的。</p>
<p>大約因爲李太白集中收有菩薩蠻，憶秦娥幾首詞罷，自宋以來，許多詞人都推李白爲詞曲之祖。自然，他们推出這樣一個偉大的詩人做開出祖師，大家都有面子。到了王　老爺，就儼然以李白自命了。他的清平樂是擬太白應制的詞。詞云：</p>
<p>黄金殿裹，燭影雙龍戲，勸得官家眞個醉，進酒猶呼萬歳。美人舞徹梁州，天恩與整搔頭。一夜御前宣住，六宫多少人愁。</p>
<p>這種作品果然可以趕得上李白麽？算他能夠撒一泡尿照照自己的，他不做李白了。他覺得：本朝的第一大詞人是柳永·趕不上古人李白，總可以賽得過近人柳永罷，於是他就居然以（冠柳）自命了，許多凑趣的朋友也就恭維他（冠柳）。可是所谓（冠柳）的詞在當時並不曾有名，至今存下來的又少又壞。只有他的卜算子一詞，送鮑浩然之浙，算是他的不朽之作。詞云：</p>
<p>水是眼波横，山是眉峯聚。欲問行人去那邊，眉眼盈盈處。才是送春歸，又送君歸去。若到江南趕上春，千萬和春住。</p>
<p>這樣的詞也許可以說得上冠柳，可惜太少了。誇嘴很容易，動手却很難。還是打嘴巴好？打手心好？</p>
<p>古往今來，文化犯誇大狂的着實不少。不幸連李赤王觀也萬萬趕不上的人也好誇大。君子曰·是亦貨眞價實之妄人也巳矣，文人云乎哉？</p>
<h3>喜訊</h3>
<p>— 顧和聲</p>
<p>一件小事，老那麽掛在心上，像有根線牽引善似的。</p>
<p>每次，　　地把寫成的稿子投入郵筒時，滿懷着成功的希望，可是總等過好久，不見回音，終於證實這希望是幻滅了，像一個夢，懵懵懂懂地。</p>
<p>這時候開始感到苦痛，懊悔去幹寫稿的事，自家兒　囌起來，說：</p>
<p>（再寫稿子是猪仔！）</p>
<p>說這話時咬緊了牙闗，表示出堅决的態度。一天，兩天，三天，在悔恨的情形下過去了。</p>
<p>漸漸地，一切都變成安詳，他似乎忘了失望這一回事，他又收集了許多材料，組織成一篇小說，又想寫，手癢癢的。</p>
<p>終於在第四天的朝上寫成了。</p>
<p>又是滿懷了成功的希望啦！喜冲冲的把稿子袋入信封中，走了。在郵局的門口停住，　進門，粘好了郵票，預備投入綠色的郵筒，突地，耳邊彷彿有人在輕聲說：</p>
<p>（没有希望的呵！）</p>
<p>他獃了半晌，才側過頭去，瞧見人家正出奇的望着他，臉一紅。在人家的監視之下，手像風濕病似的抖着，終於顫慄地投入郵筒了。透了口氣，一逕奔回家裹，可是又懊悔啦！半晌，才自慰設的，自家兒說着：</p>
<p>（一件小事，别掛在心上！）</p>
<p>眞怪，老是心兒癢癢的記掛着，像有根線牽引着似的。</p>
<p>一天，兩天……逐日地挨過了。</p>
<p>半月後的一個下午，他無聊地空想着，可是門上突然響了。答！答！答！</p>
<p>（是誰？）</p>
<p>（我！乂乂　誌社有信。）</p>
<p>他知道是郵差，希望的花又在心上開放了，一邊把門拉開，一邊急速地問：</p>
<p>（掛號嗎？）</p>
<p>（平信！）</p>
<p>心一沉，稍稍把笑臉收住了。從郵差手中接過那信，他才又笑啦！那信是薄薄的，知道不是退稿，他又想到朋友们錄取的稿子，總先來一個通知，和這封信同樣薄薄的。</p>
<p>（這回成功啦！）他自家兒想。</p>
<p>跑回原位，在一只籐椅上坐下了，吸着烟，瞇緊了眼，把信封拆開了，在朦朧中讀道：乂乂先生：</p>
<p>大作欠佳，本刋不擬採登，原稿因未附郵資，暫存社中，請來面領可也，此請著安！</p>
<p>乂乂雜誌社啟</p>
<h3>讀李漁十種曲</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>李漁的傳奇通常都是三十齣，（只有（巧團圓）多三齣，（慎鸞交）多六齣是例外）因此與結構無闗的武戲，每每拿○鶆凌數。其實字漁旣說（十部傳奇九相思）（（憐香伴）結末語）又何必硬把武戲插進去呢？武戲在劇塲上雖可免去單調，已經極不統一　在紙上那就更加無味了。</p>
<p>李漁的傳奇多寫變態心理·如：（憐香伴）是寫女子的同性戀愛：（意中缘）裹强盜大王說林天素歡喜北道（即男風），不歡喜南道。此外（巧團圓）中的兒時憶夢，也可用Ｆrend的變態心理學來解釋。（凰求鳳）說女子追逐男子，也是傳奇中所不大看見的。</p>
<p>（奈何天）過於污辱女子人格。</p>
<p>（比目魚）在十　曲裹是最有詩意的一種。</p>
<p>（凰求鳳）叙曹婉淑·喬夢蘭·和名妓許仙濤都願嫁給吕矅（哉生）。喬許門智，事極離奇。最好的是（倒嫖）（先醋）</p>
<p>（姻詫）（阻兵）這四齣。（姻詫）中梅香·小姐·院子所言各不同，文心三變，極（撲朔迷離）之致。</p>
<p>（十種曲）大都虚構·只有（意中緣）是叙董其昌和楊雲友戀愛的，其中夾叙陳眉公和林天素。（蜃中樓）則是合（柳毅傳書）和（張生煑海）而爲一。</p>
<h3>午餐</h3>
<p>— 魏猛克</p>
<p>這是什麽地方呢？心裹問。</p>
<p>趕了一程夜路，現在是太陽當頂了，稍一估計，就至少走了好幾十里。肚子裹轆轆地響，脚兒提一步重一斤，眼睛已打不開了，汗也特别的多。想睡麽？那眞是發瘋。混蛋！連狗也没一隻。</p>
<p>老百姓　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　的軍隊呢？那也不　緊·　　　　　　　　的虎皮，就足　明是一位堂堂的官長！開小差，啍！足决不會料到的。</p>
<p>人是　乎没有遇到一個，但死屍，却可　遇到不少。這眞有幾分蹊蹺了，那横七竪八的　在泥路上的屍身，竟大都成了裸體，要不是身旁還留着鋤頭扁擔之類，實在無從辨别出是兵呢還是百姓。看過去，似乎死去都還不久，因爲屍身大抵井未　　：但是，唯有那些腦袋兒，却變或了可怕的骷體：在眼睛，鼻子，嘴巴幾處洞口，正有成羣結隊的蒼蠅们，嗡嗡地　進遊出。</p>
<p>我心裘打算，倘再找不着食物，也就顧不得許多的了。</p>
<p>終于走到了一個村莊，然而那些空洞洞的屋子裹，除了幾張跛脚的破桌椅，實在也尋不出旁的東西。我在各屋子裹團團的打轉，心裹越是焦急，肚子裹越是　的利害；但終竟……哈哈！這驚喜眞是非同小可，我突然用了一個猛虎洗臉的姿勢，捕獲了一隻　老鼠了。</p>
<p>于是在一所屋子前的禾塲上，這時便騰燒起雄雄的火光，跛脚的破桌椅，也就做了薪材了。老鼠一到火裹，變成了一團紅肉，在烟霧瀰漫中，就可以嗅到一股剌戟神經的强烈的香味。這眞是想不到的吧，在二十世紀的今日，還可以吃一頓原始的午餐。</p>
<p>有誰反對捕捲烟的麽？我這有生以來的第一次鮮美的午餐，却要感謝我是一個烟鬼，因而有一盒不離身畔的火柴！</p>
<p>現在是太陽偏西了，我又開始我的行程，一步一步從死屍中跨過去。</p>
<p>但願前面有老鼠，否則，也就顧不得許多的了。</p>
<h3>剌激（二）</h3>
<p>— 謝氷</p>
<p>（冰，我们的轎子來了！）</p>
<p>浩帶着驚喜而又倉皇的語氣從外面走來告訴我。</p>
<p>（眞的嗎？）我放下了筆。</p>
<p>（眞的，我们看到他们來的，現在到了門口。）</p>
<p>不知怎麽她的臉色忽然變得嚴重而慘白起來，我的心也有點酸酸的味道了。</p>
<p>這晚我和垢做了許多事，睡得很晚：浩，早已呼呼入夢了。</p>
<p>我將信一封封地交給她，絶對不敢提到她们明早的事，就各人躺下了。我仍然睡在行軍床上，這是第三晚。</p>
<p>不要寫她们走的一刹那以及走後我心情的凄凉吧，實在太難過了，這支筆是絶對描寫不出的。</p>
<p>○○○○○</p>
<p>好们走後，每天我都在尋找剌激。</p>
<p>幾天都没有酒喝，我也不知那里有得買，本想拿着錢去亂找，總可找到一家酒店的。但一想到像米湯一般的水酒，喝了一桶也是絲毫没有酒意的，何必喝牠呢？</p>
<p>話雖如此說，昨天晚飯時終於喝了三大碗，當時有點昏昏然，可是回到房裹看了幾封來信，馬上便清醒了。</p>
<p>早晨我很快活，我像初升的太陽一般活躍，有生氣，我的心很喛和地感到舒適，我計劃好了一天的工作，而且下决心從今天起要開始寫文章了。但不知怎的忽然想起了昨天的電話，我又生氣起來。想喝點酒興奮一下，眞說消費合作社賣完了，爲了幾晚來失眠，腦筋受傷太重，要點安眠藥吃，他也不給我，眞是笑話，難道一個爲光明奮鬥的人還會自殺嗎？</p>
<p>這一氣非同小可，心裹祇是感到煩，煩，一百個煩，文章寫不出，只好拿了一本新出的小說去溪邊看，太陽暖暖地晒在我的背上，怪舒服的。一連看了百來頁，終於在九點半鐘的時候看完了。可是這小說使我失望，雖然描寫的手腕還不錯，句子有很跳皮的，很能引起讀者的興趣，但重複的句子太多了，使我討厭：小說不是童話，這小說却有些地方犯了素話似的錯誤。</p>
<p>失望之餘，自然要另找本好的書賠償損失，於是八年前看過兩次的ＸＸＸＸＡＢＣ，我又第三次讀牠了，自然現在要比那時了解得多，有興趣的多。（未完）</p>

<p>昨日粉市、一致呈疲跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥與坎拿大計跌三四五六角不等、至全部分人心、岑寂無巳、因本月份交割已近、業外淨多、旣有非了不可之勢、客帮因銷場不佳、亦無意收貨、内部分小廠、因積貨太多、亦有交出棧單之勢、回藉套頭、聞亦須一部回出市氣不振、實難倖免、遠期因廠家略抛、及人心同樣不穏、故亦帶疲、照目下情形、業中人推測　本月份或須跌至一角半闗口也、結果本月份較前日跌一分七厘半、十月份跌二分、十一月份跌二分二厘半十二月二月份各跌一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期現麥都呈平弱</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份初疲繼定、以洋麥報價、計回跌三四五六角不等、故開價時、各月份市氣、大致平疲、較前日計小去一二分不等、以後各盤、則見平定、本月份因空頭抵補、略見振動、遠期則出入甚少、交易已寂、照粉銷而言、前途難看好面、且澳麥聞又活動、喊價四元九角半、此後如匯價變動、大可注意也、結果本月份未動、十月十二月份小一分、一月份小三分、餘未動、現麥市面、仍見平疲、開浦鎭麥三元六角三分、次五角半、和州麥三元四角半、次二角半、南京麥三元五角、安慶麥三元三角七分、蕪湖麥三元四角七分、次四角二分、揚州麥三元七角、露筋麥三元七角三分、次七角、六合麥三元七角、次六角三分、鎭江麥三元五角三分、常熟麥三元六角七分、瑶灣麥三元八角九分、共開一萬一千包、</p>
<h3>豆餅之重量</h3>
<p>高低相差十二磅</p>
<p>吃虧仍是鄉下人</p>
<p>豆餅向爲肥田之主要品、國外銷路、則以日本爲最多、東三省產豆、故豆餅亦以東三省爲主要產地、東三省之豆餅、向自大連安東營口等處輸出、輸出之前、均經油餅檢查會嚴格檢騐、每片重量一律爲六十二磅、合五十六斤二五、故無畸輕畸重之弊、江浙一帶、向祗小餅、如鞋底狀而較大、自上海無錫等處油廠設立、亦有本廠餅出世、旣有（有邉）與（光邊）之分、復有正牌副牌乃至三牌四牌五牌之别、每况愈下、參差不齊、茲爲醒目起見、表列於左、等級　重量（磅）</p>
<p>正牌　六二</p>
<p>副牌　六○</p>
<p>三牌　五八</p>
<p>四牌　五四</p>
<p>五牌　五○</p>
<p>以上皆每片之重量、同一片也、重量相差有十二磅、此其由來皆爲油廠商貪圖生意、遷就内地商界之故、油廠將豆餅售於内地餅商、照重量計價、分量有輕重、價格亦有高低、至内地餅商售與農民、以每片輪價、不問斤量、故於此一進一出之間、除應得官利之外、尙有此外快收入、農民不察、爲所欺矇、此種不正當行爲、油餅製造商理應自行整頓、劃一重量、所有種種名目、卽應取銷務與東三省出品一律、政府方面亦隨時爲出廠檢查、俾免再有此等行爲、而使經濟艱苦之農民爲所剥削也、</p>

<h3>疋頭馬鬃襯花洋布再漲</h3>
<p>（馬　襯）此貨做西裝之必需品、高等定製服裝者、都用舶來品之黑炭襯、其次以國產之寗波姜山襯、因其售價較廉、店方視顧客之出價貴賤爲轉移、昨黑炭襯市存奇缺、洋行方圓到源絶跡、布　因之甚俏、　批售開價一元六　　　零　元七角半、姜山襯價亦帶高、九寸門面售二角八分、較上　又漲　分、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談慾望列火</h3>
<p>慾望是人類所同具，也許是一句凡人必需飲食一樣可靠的鐵律。</p>
<p>但人類的慾望却有着萬分紛歧的差别，很少有同曲吻合的。比如說，現在這世界頂時髦的人物要算是希特勒墨索里尼之輩，緣於傾慕，不，也許是時代的需要，就大有其人希望與若輩媲美一世的慾望。同時像甘地氏那樣的不抵抗將軍者，也一樣的能掀起有些人的慾望。有只願在滿地金銀的上海灘上做投機買賣的，也有人要到西北開發富源的。有買建設奬劵以冀一蹴暴富的人的慾望，也有按日向銀行去佇存五厘錢，以冀積沙成塔，集腋成裘的人的慾望。坐在黄包車上的人，要趕路趕急，却碰着要讓汽車的路，又要慢幾分鐘，于是就很容易生出坐汽車的慾望。拉黄包車的人，拉到骨酸氣絶，也還不能得到温飽的時候，就會興起做個坐黄包車的人的慾望。</p>
<p>慾望之所以有如此顯著的差别，是基於環境與個性之不同。如環境榨壓得太厲害，生成又是笨頭笨腦，這輩人，打個比方隔壁的灶司務，他就只有，事實上也只容許他有做飯館老聞的一日到臨的慾望。</p>
<p>但慾望却又因環境而啓示而進展。</p>
<p>於此可知，住憑慾望是怎樣的差别，却有一種共通的要義，那便是慾望必然是向上的，超現水準的。如果反乎是，那就不呌做慾望，而是（故步自封），是（保守），甚至是（墜落）。</p>
<p>欲望的第一義旣是（向上），接着就有一種特質，是（改善現實），是（前途美滿），就是說慾望的影子，全都是美麗的，爆爛的，前途是磁磚的平舖，不是泥濘的烟路。</p>
<p>至此，慾望的終極目的，　就很鮮　了，呈（享樂）。大抵迨到慾望完成了也就　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　所欲這就是現世的所謂慾望，他的出發點是向上爬，踏着别人向上爬，終極點是享樂，代享他人的樂。時代是這麽一個時代，（金錢）（享樂），成了人類的唯一的追逐鵠的，一般人的慾望也就針對着（金錢）與（享樂），除此而外，别無可說。</p>
<p>事實上彷彿也有例外，如信仰宗敎的人，他们的慾望確實有些兩樣，只願生成（活佛）（活主），死升（仙境）（天堂），但這種人究竟嫌其過少，而且這類的慾望却也不是人類，不是現實所切要，因爲他们却是太逃避了人生的至大意義。</p>
<p>那麽，人類需要怎樣的慾望呢？據我想有如下的兩種：</p>
<p>（一）求智的慾望，這不但是正在上學的青年所應有，直是凡人所應有的，無論環境怎樣，我们應有求智的慾望與决心，從書本上去找尋，或從生活上去體念，都是一樣的重要，一部人類歷史，我们可以說是智的導演，更是智的延續，人類的唯一特擅便是智。</p>
<p>（二）事業的慾望，現在一般人所最缺陷的，就是没有事業慾望，只有（金錢（同（享樂）慾望。假使一有事業慾望，必能戰勝一切的歪曲慾望，成其爲人類的功臣，社會的創造者。人類就需要這種慾望來開發未來的世界，未來的世界也只有這種人才能立足稱雄，這就是人類的最大意義之所在，值得我们歌頌。</p>

<h3>獃子　遠志</h3>
<p>在民間流傳着的故事中，有這樣一位人物：</p>
<p>妻呌他去賣布，說要賣給（硬）的人，他便掛在廟中木偶的身上，回家受了妻的責駡并要他去把布收回，他在路上，看見出殯的行列，婦人们頭上披着白布，便上去扯來，結果遭了一頓打。回家以後，妻告訴他，看到出殯的行列，應該表示哀傷，帮着哭才對；他牢記了這一點，後來，看到一家迎娶的行列，他就大哭起來，又遭了一頓打。妻又告訴他，掛着紅色的綵的，是喜事，該道賀纔對，於是他看見人家失火，就道賀了；妻說看見失火是該帮着救熄的；於是他見了鐵匠的爐火就潑水：最後，見了兩頭水牛在鬥架，他又記起了妻的敎訓，說見人鬥架，是應該上去解勸的，他上去解勸了。結果，是在水牛的角下（喪其元）。</p>
<p>老實的鄉下人，直呼這樣的人爲（獃子），而加以憫笑，但我很惋惜，中國不曾出個西萬提司（Ｃervantes）那樣的文豪，所以這樣的人物不曾被描寫在文學作品上；否則，那位西班牙文豪的（吉訶德先生）何從（專美）於前？你看上面所列的種種節目，以視吉訶德先生之（攻打風磨），（大敗比司克紳士），（認旅店作城堡）（向獅子挑戰），（奪取金盔）……種種戰蹟，稍有遜色麽？再看那結局，也不是和吉訶德先生同樣麽？</p>
<p>吉訶德先生一味相信游俠小說，我们的（獃子）一味相信（閫訓）。這一點也相同（所不同者，吉訶德先生有的是一個差不多　氣的徒弟，而我们的（獃子）所有的，却是一個聰明的妻。然而雖有這樣的妻，也無濟於那性格所造成的悲劇丨丨有的人說是喜劇。</p>
<p>林譯的（魔俠傳）的出版，不過二十　曰，兄且是　　　　　，共大丈夫讀的。而我門這民間故事，却是早就流傳着的，我敢斷定决無西萬提司的大作的影響在内，即在麽俠傳出後二十多年的今日，民間故事的述者的文章裹，也决不參入一點吉訶德先生的影子的。在這裹，惹我们深思的是，爲什麽東西洋的文學和傳說中，會不謀而合地產生出同一典型的人物和故事來？</p>
<p>這故事，實在是偉大的故事，其中的涵義是很廣的。我们要找敎訓，在這裹面可以得到許多。</p>
<p>第一，是如屠格，湼夫所指出，這里表現着人性的永久的二元之一。（第一義思索事物，踢開利害的打算，專憑不僞不飾的自己的本心而動，决不妥恊，姑且敷衍就算完事的人，）（厨川白村語），就是（吉訶德先生），就是所謂獃子。但是樣的獃子，却正是文化發達所必須的人物，較之（在因襲和偶像之前，將七曲的膝，折成八曲的智慧）的聰明人，是價值高得多的。尤其是我國民間故事中的獃子所有的那種（忘我），（爲他）的精神，在今日的社會中，最爲需要而難得。</p>
<p>第二，使我们想到敎育的問題，倘若吉訶德先生當初所讀的不是游俠小說，倘若我们聰明的妻子，能將正確的基礎的知識，敎給丈夫，那麽，他们的結果，一定不會那麽壞的。由此可見正確的敎育，是如何的需要。今日的人類之中，唯兒童尙保留着那可貴的（獃子）性，無如今日的敎育，不是把们敎成聰明，便把他们敎成荒謬。說到方針，泰半是（頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚？。）和那獃子的妻子一樣。</p>
<p>第三，上面所說的（頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚）的現象，不僅敎育界爲然。即國家大計，也是如此。自從鴉片戰爭，吃了洋大人的虧以來，我们的謀國者，從没有正確的人計，（兵戰不如商戰</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>商戰不如事戰）這樣　一直到而今，民主制度，共產主義，法西運動、五年　劃，杯　運動，不抵抗主義……看人家各有所成，我们也來仿行，但不知怎的總差了一步，行非其時。并且行得不澈底，聰明地在適可的地方停止或轉變，毫無獃子的勇往直前之概。</p>
<p>因此，我们的時代，需要獃子，同時需要正確的敎育。</p>
<h3>業餘信箱緣起</h3>
<p>以前本刋這個地位，登的是（店員通訊）。牠是本報在六十週的時候，鑒於本埠多數店員學徒，有了疑難，每苦没有互相切磋的機會而增闢的。牠的對象，原祇限於店員學徒；但是除了店員學徒之外，即就本埠一隅而論，同樣有這種需要的，正大有人在。承他们不棄，都紛紛投函通訊。起初我们對於這對象方面，十分嚴格；以致有很多有價值的問題，祗得割愛；後來一方面因爲闗於店員與學徒特有的問題，十分單調；同時另一方面我们覺得毫没有理由去拒絶店員以外讀者的通訊；所以對於這對象問題，也漸漸地從寛下來。最近我们所登的通訊，來自工作者有之，來自敎育界以及行政界亦有之。在實際上巳很自然的由（店員通訊）而轉變爲（業餘信箱）了。現在我们爲求名實相符起見，直捷爽快地把牠改稱爲（業餘信箱）。根據以前的經騐，我们知道除了對於某一事件，有實際疑問提出的來信以外，有一部份的來信，不過對於某一問題，發表其個人意見，或對於某一塲合，描寫其情狀而已。此後我们對於有實際疑問提出的來函，仍由編者就能力所及，切實答復，擇其有普遍性而又爲一般人所急欲知道者在本欄公表外，餘則由本欄逕行函復（來信務將地址開明）。至於發表意見的來信，當擇其有相當價值者，不加按語，直錄本欄。並歡迎　者討論，冀在社會上樹立一種共信，至於描寫現狀之文字，則除少數極端合理與極端不合理者分期公表，供各方之借鏡外；餘則概不作答。總之此後的工作，重在函復；公表文字，除有闗大衆利益者外，寗缺母濫。</p>

<p>第三幕　和平禮讚</p>
<p>軍事當局：你來了。孩子，你跟姨娘到樓上玩兒去。（小少爺跟着太太上樓）</p>
<p>小少爺：爸爸！你一會兒就來敎我打麻將。好嗎？</p>
<p>軍事當局：涥，你要姨娘敎你去罷。</p>
<p>小少爺：不，我要你來。你不來我不至。</p>
<p>軍事當局：好的，我一會兒就來。（望着他们的背影消失）。那個孩子眞不聽話。書也不讀，一天到晚要胡鬧。</p>
<p>機要秘書：不·小少爺到是頂聰明的。</p>
<p>軍事當局：（快樂的微笑。）怎麽樣？你見着田委員没有？</p>
<p>機要秘書：見着了的。他的意思是政府旣然有了這樣的决心，現在的事情是很好辦的。昨天晚上，他一接到那電報，便到日本公使館去訪問了代理公使，據說：公使館是很同意的，我们能夠這樣犪牲成見，和平不難實現。不過闗東軍司令方面怎樣，他還不知道，據日代公使的意思，一定要我们這方面派代表到密雲去。公使館也可派一個人同去。和闗東軍方面當面談判。</p>
<p>軍事當局：那末公使館是不是巳經將我们當局的意見轉到東京去了呢？機要秘書：這一點田委員是問過他们的。據說他已經去電請訓，大概東京方面是不成問題；這是他们可以負責的。不過他總擔心闗東軍方面是否能完全同意，到是問題，所以最好是我们能夠去當面談判。</p>
<p>軍事當局：可見日本軍閥眞是專横。……那末闗於代表的人選，田委員没有什麽意見嗎？</p>
<p>機要秘書：這到没有表示，不過我想就是你提出什麽意見來，他也不見得可以公然反對。</p>
<p>軍事當局：這一點我到也没有成見。不過我的那位内弟你看怎樣？</p>
<p>機要秘書：很好很好！</p>
<p>軍事當局：我想讓他去試試看。他好幾次要求我介紹事給他做。小的不要幹，大的又没有好機會。我想這一次雖然不是如何了不起的差事，可是也未嘗不是一個進身之所。</p>
<p>機要秘書：好極，好極。而且他以前不是在長崎做過領事的嗎？現在敎他和日本人交涉，更是才得其用。</p>
<p>馬弁：（自外上）有一個外國人來見。（授卡片給軍事當局）</p>
<p>軍事當局：誰？開濼煤礦總理。有没有中國人一道？</p>
<p>馬弁：没有。</p>
<p>軍事當局：那末施秘書呢？没有人翻譯怎麽辦？</p>
<p>機要秘書：我看不用翻譯，他是可以說中國話的。</p>
<p>軍事當局：噢？那末請他進來罷。（機要秘書退至絨幕後，一個外國人礦山主上。）</p>
<p>礦山主：自從貴國實行軍事抵抗以來，敝公司的煤炭，因着運輸的不便，損失不小。所以我们希望貴國政府對於我们固有的利益，根據條約的規定，充分的加以保護。這在增進大英帝國和貴國的友誼闗係上，我们希望能夠立刻聽着貴長官圓　的答覆。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（一）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>爲了使觀衆们對於中國電影作家有着比梘在更進一步的了解，爲了前進的作家们能藉此機會接近觀衆，我想，這種訪問不是完全没有意味的吧。</p>
<p>不過，在這裹必得聲明，我们的訪問，决不是爲幾個作家義務的捧塲，同樣，我们除了談話的記載之外，還得有一種客觀的主觀批判。而且因着時間或業務上的闗係，發表次序的先後，毫無意義。丨丨以上算是序言。</p>

<p>一，（母性之光）導演卜萬蒼。</p>
<p>我们凡是留心中國電影的觀衆们，對於這一位導演，决不會輕易忽視吧。正因爲他是爲人们所重視的藝人，於是我便到聯華第一廠登門拜訪了。</p>
<p>一個擔任負很重的人，在事業上總是很忙的，不過經過小小波折，總算是會着了。</p>
<p>照例，對於某一要人的介紹，總得在他身上描晝幾律，於是我對於他的形容是：假如不了解他的家財的人，一定以爲他是一個家財萬貫的富兒郎。至少他的肚皮也就大得可以，雖然不一定全是牛肉汁或是雞湯，然而說句恭維話，那便是（滿腹經綸）了，經綸而且滿腹，自然是了不起的人材。</p>
<p>他的人很爽快而和藹，這是很可以在他臉上看出來的。譬如說，他的那隻厚而大的手，當他和你握手的時候，可以說是旣痛而且熱情。</p>
<p>稿紙有限，閒話少提。反正他是一個有了兩個孩子的父親，大槪不會有誰家多情女子，會因了我這簡陋的形容而對這大胖子害起相思病來。一笑。</p>
<p>彼此坐定，一陣寒喧，不待進茶，我便發問：</p>
<p>（請問先生對於中國電影有什麽意見。）</p>
<p>自然，這是很空泛的問題，當時很後悔不該如此道出。然而旣經出口，也就無法收問。只見他想了一想，馬上便應對如流。若以他比之考試院的口試中的高材，那未我便榮膺爲考試院長了。（未完）</p>

<h3>評（賴婚）Ｗay　Down　East</h3>
<p>— 凌鴻</p>
<p>本來這是一部默片時代的名作，現因配音的闗係，所以亦加以簡短的批評。</p>
<p>首先我们得知道這一位導演葛雷菲斯（Ｄ.W.Griffitb），是美國影壇最老的人物，只就他首先使用（特寫）（Ｃ.P.）的鏡頭，便可證明他對於電影的功績（賴婚），在情調上無疑義是非常成功的。這是電影史上不可磨滅的記載。正確的說，是一部有生命的悲劇，一首哀怨的抒情詩。</p>
<p>闗於他的導演方法，蘇聯名導演愛森斯坦亦竭誠欽佩。他承認他從葛雷菲斯處學習了很多。同時他應當是世界導演的敎師。但是我们對於他的方法和手段，决不是全部無條件的接收，而是站在正確的立場上批判的承受。這是我们接收前人遺產之必要的認識。</p>
<p>毫無疑問，葛雷菲斯的農民意識是非常濃厚的。他咒咀資產者污穢的愛情，他反對封建社會之舊祖敎的殺人，然而他是英雄主義的，他是主張以人與人的愛來解釋這種醜態的。所以有少年達偉來壯懷激烈的拯救安娜，所以人们對於安娜終於同情而對山德生加以憎惡。同時他將安娜寫成一個十足的怯懦者，（雖然她也曾斥駡出德生，但到底没有反抗。）而使好得着人们充分的同情，所以作者到底不是反封建的戰士，不過是生長在封建社會中的一個多情善感的詩人，一個十足的唯心論者，一個戀愛至上主義者。</p>
<p>這樣，我们對他的觀念當然不能接收，同時，對於傳達這觀念的作品技巧，自然是批評的學習，否則我们便成爲這觀念的繼承者了。</p>
<p>然而我们對於這具有歷史性的作品，並没有理由可以怱視，反之，我们在這古典中正可追尋電影史中過往的痕跡。</p>
<p>麗琳格舒自然是非常成功的了。其他諸人亦均甚佳。</p>
<p>闗於配音，現增加劇的效能的一點上，我们當然是非常同意的。這同鄒臺劇的（效果）一棧，很可以補救默片的缺點。然而這决不是像（城市之光）中一樣，將對白配成一種莫明其妙的怪聲。丨以上，在（賴婚）中正是如此。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>（到上海去）的疵點</h3>
<p>— 喻比</p>
<p>（到上海去）是以（提倡識字）與（普及敎育）爲背景。</p>
<p>劇情是述兩個鄉下人，他们結伴（到上海去），在途中　出了許多的笑話，後來他们仗義救火，得到兩位小姐的青睞，把家產之半酬勞他们，他们感到（不識字的苦）與（敎育不普及）（交通不便利）（便出資在故鄉辦了小學校和小火車，不久他们得到小姐的許配，又承繼他们岳父的基事。</p>
<p>導演在本片中很覺平庸，没有一些驚人的技巧，小疵點的地方很多，如王江兩人半途下車問路，他们没有這樣笨，見了軍警和郵差嚇得到走，以我的愚見，没有這樣的胆小，他们旣然不識字，會什麽見了東方飯店（飯店）兩字他们又何以認識字。</p>

<p>一片裹，有一幕係和李屈賽合演的，她須吃楊梅蛋糕一大塊。想不到這段影片竟重拍至三四次之久，而羅蘭妲揚每次重拍，須吃楊梅蛋糕一大塊。於是她竟吃了四五塊之多，一直到她嘴都張不開了。可幸這段影片終究拍好了，而這位楊小姐亦回家了。她的侍女端上晚餐來請她吃晚飯。羅蘭妲楊對著食物望而生厭，命侍女撤下去。侍女恭茶敬敬地徹了下去，却又送上一盆精緻點心。羅蘭妲楊一看那點心，歎了一口氣道：（我早知道。一定又是楊梅蛋糕。我今天和楊梅蛋糕打了一天的官司，到現在還没有打清也。）演員的表情，有許多的地方都含有做作，平平而巳。</p>
<h3>觀（滿江紅）後的意見</h3>
<p>— 敷禮</p>
<p>（滿江紅）是一部數十萬言的長篇小說，要把它來改編成一部電影劇本，而没有些漏洞的地方，確是不可能的事。</p>
<p>其中有幾個疵點；有待我们商榷的，如：</p>
<p>（一）李桃枝和萬有光動身到上海結婚，於水村從小香處得到消息，他便立刻到上海去尋桃枝，水村是一個窮朋友，在上海竟住得起這樣華麗的飯店，住飯店的經費，不知從何而來？（二）水村在茶房口内聽到有光與桃枝結婚，竟在其所居之飯店内，此等處好像茶房早知水村心事而直言之，未免牽强。</p>
<p>（三）當輪船失火時一幕，佈景太簡單，男女旅客逃奔時，並無一些慌張着急之狀，而且不見有船員水手等，亦無救命器具，這些地方導演，實難辭其疏忽之咎。</p>
<p>談到演員，以胡蝶，龔稼農，及王獻齋爲最稱職。惟王徵信飾梁秋山，在醫院一幕，太無病容亦殊不類。其餘尙屬平平，光線甚清晣。配音亦佳，總之，（滿江红）一片尙有一觀之價值。</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Shunyi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu led his troops from the Fengshankou area into Hebei Province yesterday morning. His vanguard was mostly cavalry, so his movements were rapid. When they advanced to the county seat of Huairou, the four city gates were tightly closed. He issued a warning that if the gates were not opened within a certain time, he would attack the city. After County Magistrate Xu Wenquan and local gentry consulted, to avoid devastation in the city, they decided to open the gates and welcome them. Fang then led his troops to occupy the county seat, and the rear troops also arrived successively, totaling about a thousand people. They placed the county magistrate and the head of the public security bureau under surveillance and disarmed the entire Sixth Team of the Second Company of the Second Security Brigade stationed there. There has been no active action yet. The authorities in Beiping are paying close attention to this. However, due to the Tanggu Truce, if troops are immediately dispatched to block them, it is feared that this would cause a misunderstanding with the Japanese side. Tonight, the authorities specially sent Yin Tong to the Japanese embassy to meet with Military Attaché Chiba to discuss ways to deal with Fang's troops. Chiba has agreed to forward a telegram to the Kwantung Army headquarters for consultation. At the same time, he has ordered the troops stationed nearby to be on strict guard to prevent them from fleeing south. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) County Magistrate Su of Shunyi reported by telephone this afternoon that after Fang's troops occupied Huairou County on the 20th, the vanguard was only six or seven hundred people, but they have gradually increased to more than two thousand people. They entered the city, killed five public security soldiers, confiscated all their firearms, and placed the county magistrate, the head of the public security bureau, and the president of the Chamber of Commerce under surveillance. Fang himself is now stationed in the city, and his sentries have been placed in the Nanshicao area under the Sixth District of Shunyi, seemingly intending to flee south. The county government is requesting instructions on how to deal with the situation. At 10:00 a.m. on the 21st, a Japanese plane flew from the north of Shunyi to above Shunyi County seat, reconnoitered for a week, and then flew north. Since the establishment of the armistice agreement, Japanese planes have not come for a long time. This time, taking advantage of Fang's occupation of Huairou, Japanese planes came to reconnoiter again, which must have a different purpose. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Jitang and others held a meeting in Dushikou Yunchaibao and decided to flee east from Dushikou. After the 9th of this month, Fang Jitang went east in succession, colluding with the traitor Zhang Haipeng in advance, so he was able to pass through Fengning County. After Fang arrived at Yong'anbao, he joined forces with Zheng Guilin, Wang Zhongfu, and Zhi Yinglin's troops, totaling more than five thousand people. They fled into the Great Wall through Changyuan Pass. Fang and others planned to first occupy Huairou, and then develop towards Miyun, Jixian, and Yutian, and join forces with the bandits in Luandong. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang Zhenwu's troops occupied Huairou, they posted slogans all over the city and ordered the local authorities to prepare supplies and accommodation. Last night, a large number of cavalry arrived successively and were stationed inside and outside Huairou County, mostly from Zheng Guilin's troops, totaling more than five thousand people who have arrived in Huairou. There are still some coming from Rehe via detours. Starting this morning, the army dispatched detachments to patrol the four villages, reaching Qiaozicun, the border between Huairou and Changping, in the south, Wanghuacun in the east, and the border of Miyun County in the north. All travelers coming south from Miyun are being stopped. Those traveling from Beiping to Miyun can be released after inspection. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The relief commissioner of the War Zone Relief Association went to Huairou and Miyun to distribute relief supplies. He returned to Beiping today and said that after Fang Ji's remnant troops occupied Huairou County, Fang Jitang and his troops continued to enter from Changyuan Pass. On the way back to Beiping, they discovered several camel teams carrying Japanese flags, totaling about sixty or seventy camels, all carrying large quantities of military food and gasoline, transporting them to Huairou. (21st Dispatch) (Beiping) A telephone call from Gaoliying stated that someone from Huairou said that Fang Zhenwu's vanguard, about fifty cavalrymen, arrived at Qiaozicun at about 9:00 a.m. this morning and set up sentry posts there. Last night, Fang's main force entered the city from the North Pass successively, stationed in the people's houses in the city, and ordered the merchants and residents to prepare supplies and accommodation. Sentry posts were spread all over the city, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass through the city. Fang has not yet arrived at the county seat. Slogans are posted everywhere in the city, and the guard is very strict day and night. (21st Dispatch) (Beiping) The bandit troops of Lao Haozi are moving from Luandong to the vicinity of Sanhe, intending to establish contact with Fang Ji and others in Huairou, Miyun, and Jixian. They are also under the command of the Japanese and puppets and have great significance. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the bandit troops of Lao Haozi fled to Sanhe, they set fires along the way, and many villages were burned. The refugees in the area fled to Yuguan in one part, and to Liushouying and other places in another. According to someone who came from Yuguan today, when the Beining Road train passed Liushouying yesterday, the villages were a blaze of fire, a tragic sight. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Beiping stated that Fang Zhenwu's army and the Central Army are one li apart in Gaoliying and are now in a confrontational situation. A part of the Central Army has crossed the armistice line and approached Gaoliying. Therefore, the Japanese authorities in Beiping are investigating the actual situation. (21st Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Beiping stated that Fang Zhenwu's army has sentries stationed near Huairou, seemingly intending to move south when the opportunity arises. The armies of Liu Guitang, Tang Yulin, and Ji Hongchang near Tanghe have also begun to move towards Huairou. The total number of these armies is 40,000, and they continue to intrude into the armistice zone. Japanese planes reconnoitered towards Miyun and Huairou at 10:00 a.m. this morning. (21st Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Beiping stated that according to someone who returned to Beiping from Miyun, a part of Fang Ji's army surrounding Huairou County seat, numbering more than 2,000, invaded the city and disarmed the public security team. It is said that Fang Zhenwu has entered Huairou County seat. The county magistrate and the head of the public security bureau have been placed under surveillance. (21st Jiji News Agency Dispatch) (Tokyo) A telegram from Beiping stated that the Central government is concerned about the expansion of the situation due to the intrusion of Fang Ji's army into the neutral zone. This afternoon, it dispatched a part of the 25th Division of the Central Army to the vicinity of Shunyi on the armistice line to prepare for any eventuality. (21st Jiji News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The activities of Fang Zhenwu's troops are causing considerable concern here. According to official sources, 600 of Fang's soldiers have entered Huairou and occupied it. Officials regard them as bandits, but they are limited by the Tanggu Truce and cannot send troops to suppress them. It is rumored that Fang Zhenwu is currently in Fengning, which is in the territory of Rehe Province. It is not yet known whether his troops' activities in Huairou have his consent. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is now reported by reliable sources that Fang Zhenwu's main force occupied Huairou at 11:00 a.m. today, and the army is maintaining order in the city. Huairou has completely fallen. A part of the 25th Division of the Central Army has reached Gaoliying. (21st Japan United News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan was originally scheduled to return to Chahar today, but because the Military Council continued to meet this morning and matters with all parties have not yet been finalized, he changed his return to Chahar to the 22nd. Qin Dechun and Pang Bingxun's subordinates will travel with him. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that he did not attend the Military Council meeting this morning because he visited Ma Hongbin.

<p>The 19th Route Army Defeats the Red Bandits of Xiqin, Qingzhou</p>
<h3>Defeated Bandits in Yanping Attempt to Flee to Western Fujian, but Cannot Go Upstream, Gradually Becoming a Current Bandit Difficult to Govern</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) A certain regiment of a certain division severely defeated the remaining Reds between Xiqin, Qingzhou, killing and capturing more than a thousand people.

The upstream military force is not strong and cannot annihilate them. The bandits' goal is western Fujian, so more than two divisions of military force in western Fujian cannot be mobilized, forming a difficult-to-govern current bandit situation upstream. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Arita's Envoy to China Theory</p>
<h3>A Diplomat Who Has Always Advocated Aggression Against China, Served as the Director of the Asian Bureau When the Jinan Incident Occurred</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tokyo Special News, after the new Foreign Minister Hirota took office, he had quite a vision to renew the diplomatic situation and intended to greatly adjust the ambassadors and consuls stationed abroad. Recently, news has spread in the Japanese diplomatic community that Hirota intends to appoint Arita Hachiro as the ambassador to China. According to Arita, he is from Shingai Prefecture, Japan, and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University. He passed the diplomatic and consular officer exams in the 42nd year of Meiji and rose through the ranks. In the 13th year of Taisho, he served as the consul general in Tianjin, our country. He has always advocated aggression against China. After the Jinan Incident occurred in the 17th year of the Republic of China, Tanaka also served as the foreign minister. In order to implement his tough diplomacy, Arita was transferred back from his position as a counselor at the embassy in Germany to become the director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All plans were made by him, and he was known for his arrogance. Later, he was selected as the ambassador to Austria. The Chinese people have a very negative impression of him, no less than that of Fukuda Hikosuke, the commander of the Sixth Division of the Japanese Army, who was the culprit of the Jinan Incident.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Economic Panic in China's Rural Areas</h3>
<p>(Five acres for a homestead, planted with mulberry trees... A hundred acres of land, do not rob it of its time...) This was the highest and most far-reaching political ideal in ancient China, and also the peaceful and prosperous world that ordinary people yearned for. Although the foundation of our current social organization has changed, this idea still has a great dominance. Because agricultural management is still the main source of production in our country, and the number of farmers accounts for at least 70% of the total population. Therefore, the strength of the market prosperity and the key to social prosperity and decline lie in the rise and fall of this rural area.</p>
<p>Today, the rural areas all over the country, from south to north, are in a precarious situation. If we try to explore the reasons for its decline, it is indeed impossible to describe it in a short article. But to summarize the main points: one is the instability of the political situation. Since the late Qing Dynasty, officials have been mostly corrupt, and the national tax has become increasingly heavy, and there have been many illegal exploitations. Therefore, the farmers have fallen into poverty. The second is the economic weakness. The general production in our country is still based on handicraft industry, so it is difficult to compete with capitalist countries. All undertakings in rural areas are also subject to the erosion of cheap commodity imports, and the exploitation of high-interest loans and extra-legal donations and taxes. Even farmers who are law-abiding, self-respecting and diligent throughout the year will not be able to survive. As the rural areas are deteriorating day by day, the small and medium-sized cities are also directly affected, and the current crisis of national economic turmoil has evolved.</p>
<p>This world economic panic has lasted for a long time and has spread to various countries. Although our country's economy is backward, it cannot avoid this serious impact. Therefore, all rural side businesses have suffered huge blows. For example, silkworms. Due to the sharp drop in silk prices, silkworm farmers cannot repay the price of leaves. After March of this year, raw silk has slightly decreased overseas, and the American raw silk market has been seized by Japan. Therefore, China's silk industry has also been devastated. The same is true for tea. Compared with the same period last year, since January of this year, the amount of decline in exports has reached more than 4 million national currencies. Other items such as leather and eggs are also piled up everywhere and cannot be sold. The economic devastation of the rural areas is self-evident.</p>
<p>The foundation of agricultural production is based on land. This land is especially the actual purpose of those who are engaged in agriculture. The general situation of agriculture in our country is that the main product in the north is wheat, while in the Yangtze River Basin, rice is the main product. According to common theory, our country should have surplus rice and wheat to export. However, in fact, in addition to the large amount of soybeans produced in the three northeastern provinces, there is no export of rice and wheat. On the contrary, there are large imports. According to the customs report, our country imported more than 22.4 million piculs of foreign rice last year, worth more than 100 million gold units. In the past eight months of this year, 16.7 million piculs of foreign rice were imported, worth 62.33 million gold units. Last year, more than 15 million piculs of wheat were imported, worth more than 43 million gold units. From January to August this year, 17.3 million piculs of wheat were imported, worth 44.1 million gold units. Judging from the above figures, industrial cities in our country, such as Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Beiping-Tianjin, must rely entirely on foreign food. How can an ancient country known for its agriculture have this phenomenon? The Yangtze River Basin mostly had a bumper harvest last year, and the price has not risen sharply, and it cannot even maintain the minimum price that matches the cost of production. Why? However, this is not difficult to answer in one sentence. That is, there is unscrupulous dumping by foreign countries, and domestic transportation is blocked, and donations and taxes are extremely heavy. As a result, rice and grain are stored in the place of origin, and there is no market to sell them even at low prices. Moreover, the mainland's finances are tight, and the value of currency has risen invisibly, and agricultural products have suffered a great misfortune.</p>
<p>In the future, the way to regenerate is to eliminate all kinds of heavy taxes and miscellaneous donations on the one hand, in other words, abolish the indirect tax system and replace it with a direct tax system; on the other hand, strictly prohibit the army from disturbing the rural areas, and the high-interest exploitation of local bullies and landlords must be cracked down on. And actively build farmer credit cooperatives, so that rural finance has room for maneuver. Strive to carry it out unremittingly, then after three or two years, there may be hope to reverse the crisis and open up new avenues.</p>
<h3>The Austrian Cabinet Suddenly Reorganized, the Iron-Fisted Premier Holds Six Important Positions Simultaneously, Controls the National Armed Forces, Treats National Socialism Like a Flood, and Implements Fascist Politics</h3>
<p>Vienna The Austrian (Iron-Fisted Premier) Dollfuss forced the old cabinet to resign, and within a few hours, formed a new cabinet, and was sworn in before the president at noon. In addition to serving as the prime minister, Mr. Dollfuss also served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Internal Affairs, Public Security, and Agriculture, holding six important positions in one body, so that the Internal Guard, the police, and the army were all under the command of one person, in order to eliminate the power of political parties. In addition, the former Minister of Public Security, Fei Ai, was changed to Deputy Prime Minister, Bulei was re-elected as Minister of Finance, Stoke Ginger was re-elected as Minister of Commerce, and former Minister of Justice, Hugh Schuster, was appointed as the Minister of Education and Justice. It is expected that the new government will implement fascist politics, but will vigorously reject the National Socialist Party and the Socialist Party, and it is heard that Mr. Dollfuss himself is also against the Jews. (21st National Electric)</p>
<p>Vienna Austrian Premier Dr. Dollfuss, after recently being opposed by members of the Internal Guard, decided to take over all major political affairs himself. Dr. Dollfuss first consulted with President Miklas, and then issued a bulletin at midnight, announcing this decision. Dr. Dollfuss, who is small in stature but strong in wrist, has always been known as "Little Napoleon." He regards the infiltration of National Socialist forces into Austria as a flood. Recently, there was a rumor that Dr. Dollfuss was tired of his job, until a few days ago, Dr. Dollfuss rejected the request made by the Internal Guard to elect people with modernity as the Minister of National Defense, etc., and the rumors stopped. Dr. Dollfuss will set off for Geneva at the end of this week, and on the one hand, plans to recruit national talents to organize a new cabinet. All members of parliament who serve as cabinet members must resign from their positions as members of parliament. (21st Reuters Dispatch) Vienna Austrian Premier Dollfuss will implement his warning to establish a dictatorship system, and has taken over the Internal Guard, the police, and all popular armed forces, officially as part of the national armed forces. At the same time, he is engaged in reorganizing the cabinet, and has obtained a formal order from the president, granting him full power to organize any kind of government. However, according to people in the government, Dollfuss only wants to obtain dictatorial power over the armed forces, and it is not yet clear whether he wants to have complete command over financial and other political affairs. As of now, the national armed forces have completely broken away from the control of various political factions. It is also heard that Dollfuss had discussed the list of cabinet members with the president one by one before taking over the armed forces, and only made slight changes. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hirota Will Convene a Diplomatic Conference to Hear About the Political Situation in Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota recently plans to hold a joint conference of foreign envoys and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have the ambassadors report on the political situation in their respective countries, in order to provide information for establishing a concrete plan for Japan's diplomatic policy. Regarding the United States, which is the most important part of Japan's diplomacy in the future, there is some regret that there are no returnees recently for the establishment of a diplomatic policy toward the United States. After consulting with Ambassador to the United States Izubuchi, he may order the ambassador or the consul general in New York, Horiuchi Kensuke, to return to the country. Consul General Horiuchi has lived overseas for more than ten years. At this time, he may return to the country first, and Ambassador Izubuchi also intends to return to the country at the end of this year, or he may return to the country in response to Foreign Minister Hirota's telegram, and the two may return to the country one after another, which is also unknown.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the establishment of diplomatic policy, the joint conference recently held at the Foreign Minister's official residence is a conference between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ambassadors stationed abroad to report on the recent political situation in European and American countries, as well as their attitudes towards Japan, exchange opinions, and freely discuss diplomatic policies. This kind of conference has been biased towards instructional diplomacy in the past, but this time, it renews the face of diplomacy and is considered an excellent opportunity to thoroughly convey the Foreign Minister's vision to the ambassadors stationed abroad, and its effect is quite promising. The people at the first meeting were Foreign Minister Hirota, Deputy Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the Trade Bureau Kurasu, Director of the European and American Bureau Togo, Director of the Asian Bureau Kuwajima, Director of the Treaty Bureau Kuriyama, and Director of the Information Department Amau, on the Ministry side, and Ambassador to France Nagaoka, Minister to Greece Kawashima, Minister to Romania Fujita, Minister to Chile Mori, Minister to Siam Yatabe, Counselor of the British Embassy Kato, and Counselor of the Chinese Embassy Yano, among the ambassadors stationed abroad. However, there are no returning American envoys, and Ambassador to the United States Izubuchi or Consul General of New York Horiuchi will be ordered to return home.

<h3>The United States and Japan Compete to Build Ships, and Britain Will Also Join</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt intends to freely carry out the American shipbuilding program, up to the limit allowed by the treaty. This program requires approximately £47 million in funding, including the construction of 37 warships, including four 10,000-ton cruisers. The construction work has been prepared. President Roosevelt said that the shipbuilding contracts have now been issued and cannot be cancelled under any circumstances. Navy personnel claimed that this shipbuilding program would still make the United States Navy less than 100 warships less than the naval power it should have in 1936. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) American Under Secretary of the Navy Henry Roosevelt said today that a full navy is economic insurance. There is no reason to worry that the American shipbuilding program will cause shipbuilding competition again. It must be known that the British and Japanese navies both exceed the United States. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The British government expressed to the American representative Davis, during Davis's visit to Britain, its concern about the shipbuilding competition that is about to occur, saying that the American shipbuilding program will give people a bad impression when the disarmament conference is about to open. The above reliable news will be announced in the future. It is to explain the current rumor in Washington that Britain has asked the United States to slow down the shipbuilding program. It is said that if a shipbuilding competition occurs between Japan and the United States, Britain may not be able to remain indifferent. At that time, Britain will also have to join the competition. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Officials here were not surprised to hear that the American president has no intention of slowing down the construction project of 32 warships. At the same time, they declared that Britain has never been afraid of being drawn into a shipbuilding competition. Similarly, there is not much anxiety about the news that Japan will build new ships. According to reliable sources, although there were startling headlines in the newspapers when the news of American shipbuilding was first heard, personnel in the Navy Department never had a sleepless night, because the Navy Department had anticipated that the United States would build new ships to replace old ones and increase tonnage, so that it would approach the treaty stipulated amount, and they are not afraid that the United States or Japan will violate current treaty obligations.

<p>(Tokyo) According to the "Tokyo News," the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Japan has invented a new photosensitive plate (suitable for both film and hard plates) that can photograph objects even in clouds of smoke. It is reported that this invention is the result of twelve years of dedicated effort by Dr. Kakui of the Institute since 1922. The new photosensitive plate is created by utilizing the strengths of various existing photosensitive plates and compensating for their weaknesses. It can photograph movement even in smoke screens, making it very useful for military purposes. It is said that the details of the invention will be announced at the Physical and Chemical Society conference in November. (21st, China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations for the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway Scheduled to Resume Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When Uchida was the Foreign Minister, negotiations regarding the illegal sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway were stalled because Japanese opinions were not unified. The puppet representative, Ōhashi, controlled by the Japanese military, adhered rigidly to the military's aggressive policies and refused to compromise, insisting on a price of 50 million yuan, leading to a deadlock. After Hirota took over as Foreign Minister, he urged the Russian ambassador on September 17th to reopen negotiations. It is reported that the Russian ambassador agreed, and a meeting was scheduled for 10:00 AM on September 22nd at the residence of the Japanese Vice Foreign Minister. Whether Foreign Minister Hirota can get the Japanese military to abandon its aggressive policies is a matter of great concern both at home and abroad. (21st, China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Baryshnikov, the Director of the State Bank of the Soviet Union, is one of the Soviet representatives at the Chinese Eastern Railway sale conference. According to the "Hochi Shimbun," this individual is not only handling the conference affairs but is also engaged in other activities to establish a Russian-Japanese economic alliance and organize a Russian-Japanese bank. The purpose of the economic alliance is to facilitate long-term credit trade between the two countries and jointly develop the natural resources of the Far East. The Russian bank aims to further strengthen the economic and financial ties between the two countries. (21st, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Attaches Importance to Disarmament: Cabinet Decides to Send Simon to Geneva</h3>
<p>(London) The government's decision to send Foreign Secretary Simon and Under-Secretary Eden to the Geneva Disarmament Conference demonstrates the government's great importance placed on this discussion. Simon and Eden will depart tomorrow or Friday, with a short stopover in Paris to meet with French cabinet members who spoke with Eden and British Ambassador Tyrrell earlier this week. The decision to send Simon and Eden together was made during today's cabinet meeting, where all members believed that every effort should be made to reach a disarmament agreement. It was felt that the consequences of failing to agree on a convention would be dire. Reliable British sources attach great importance to the recent amity between France and Italy, as Italy now holds the key to the overall situation in many ways. It is also reported that the cabinet understands recent changes in the German situation and sympathizes with France's resulting anxiety. France is now eager to establish a mechanism for managing armaments. While Britain acknowledges the need for serious monitoring, it currently seeks concrete agreement on technical disarmament before addressing the necessary institutional issues. A Reuters correspondent in Paris reports that the French generally believe that U.S. representative Davis can reconcile the views of Britain, France, and Italy. It is believed in Paris that only in this way can a trial plan be negotiated and submitted to Germany. However, there is little hope of obtaining a clear "yes" or "no" response from Germany.

<h3>Cuban Rebels Rise Up</h3>
<p>San Martín's Stay or Departure Uncertain</p>
<p>U.S. Continues to Send Four Warships to Protect Nationals</p>
<p>Havana: The situation in Cuba is deteriorating. It is reported that many small anti-government groups have merged and are growing in strength. In Oriente Province, three groups have merged under the command of Balan and occupied the town of Gibara, intending to advance to other towns. In addition, there are many anti-government forces in Santa Clara Province, Camagüey Province, and further west. Opposition parties here have openly supported the anti-government forces, hoping they will eliminate the Soviet governments established by student soldiers in fifteen towns, as Balan has called for the elimination of extreme radicals. The U.S. Consul has been instructed by Secretary of State Hull to notify American nationals in various locations to gather at the coast. In the event of unrest, they should take refuge on U.S. warships. Today, the U.S. Navy Department sent four destroyers from Guantánamo to Cuba. However, U.S. troops are only allowed to land when necessary to rescue American nationals. Although Havana is stable, typesetters and reporters are on strike because employers refused to raise wages. There will be no newspapers tomorrow.</p>
<p>Havana: Professor San Martín resigned from the Student Revolutionary Committee last night, and his position is currently uncertain. The Revolutionary Committee has not yet decided whether to retain him. According to reliable sources, former President Céspedes, who was overthrown after only a few days in office, has taken refuge in a foreign embassy. The Cuban situation is deteriorating as a result of the labor unrest, and the spread of fever is also increasing national resentment. There is now a mixed force of soldiers, students, and workers pursuing rebel General Hernández. It is reported that they have surrounded Hernández and his 500 armed civilians who left Camagüey Province, demanding San Martín's resignation. However, San Martín stated today that he will abide by the party's decision regarding his resignation. (20th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Earthquake in Japan</h3>
<p>Kanazawa: At 12:30 PM on the 21st, a violent earthquake suddenly struck the Kanazawa area, lasting for about two minutes. People who were eating lunch rushed out of their houses, creating a very chaotic situation.

Many houses near the station collapsed, causing deaths and injuries. The rest of the situation is currently unknown. (21st, Joint Dispatch)</p>
<p>U.S. Recognition of Soviet Russia Expected This Year</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Indicates that He Can Handle the Issue of Debt to Russia Using Presidential Authority: Resolution of the Issue is Not a Problem; Business Negotiations Are Actively Underway</h3>
<p>(New York) According to reliable sources, the United States will recognize the Soviet Union before Congress convenes. When a certain important figure inquired of President Roosevelt about the diplomatic situation, Roosevelt replied that he would be willing to handle the matter when he was free to act. (20th, Reuters Dispatch) (Washington) According to reliable sources, U.S. President Roosevelt has decided to officially recognize the Soviet Union before Congress convenes in January next year. Roosevelt reportedly told those close to him that recognition of the Soviet Union could be done through presidential authority. However, fearing opposition from anti-Russian elements in Congress, he plans to implement recognition as soon as possible before Congress convenes. However, U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union requires a solution to the problem of debt to Russia, which may inevitably involve detours. (20th, Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The issue of recognizing Soviet Russia continues to receive special attention from the U.S. government. The White House intends to first negotiate the issue of Tsarist Russian loans and the Soviet confiscation of American property. It is expected that recognition of the Soviet Union will be granted when an agreement on this issue is signed. We should recall that the Soviet Union has consistently used the U.S. intervention in Arkhangelsk, the Urals, and Siberia as a reason to offset these U.S. demands. In addition, Roosevelt has appointed banker Morganthau as a government advisor to conduct business negotiations with the Soviet Union. The outcome of these negotiations will also have a significant impact on U.S. recognition of the Soviet Union. American industry and agriculture are both requesting loans to trade with the Soviet Union. These requests will be submitted to the President and then transferred to the China Relief Finance Corporation, which will implement the loans. The Soviet Union is currently preparing to purchase 3 million yuan worth of American cotton, as well as a large number of machines necessary for the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan, and butter and food. (20th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) U.S. President Roosevelt has abandoned his traditional anti-Russian foreign policy and decided to recognize the Soviet Union before Congress convenes in January next year. Regarding this information, a person familiar with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following observations: There is no shortage of advocates for the United States to recognize the Soviet Union. Two years have passed, and since Roosevelt took office, he has held different views from the Hoover era and has given the matter more serious consideration. The reasons for this are as follows: (1) To promote trade with Russia (the current negotiations between the U.S. Financial Rehabilitation Corporation and the Soviet Union on the Second Commercial Agreement are one example). (2) To implement a U.S.-Russian alliance in politics, that is, given Japan's activity, to have the Soviet Union restrain Japan's continental policy, which may have some underlying motives. However, on the other hand, regarding the issue of the United States recognizing the Soviet Union, politicians, businessmen, and soldiers in the Republican Party are all extremely afraid that the United States will fall into communism and are therefore extremely opposed to this action. If President Roosevelt ignores their opposition and resolutely implements this before Congress convenes, it will inevitably cause major problems. In short, no matter what, if this happens, the benefits will accrue to the Soviet Union, as the inflow of foreign capital will be sufficient to promote its Second Five-Year Plan. (21st, Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. President Roosevelt has now decided to formally recognize the Soviet Union this year and appointed Henry Morganthau, the president of the Agricultural Finance Corporation, as the chairman of the trade negotiations committee with Russia on the 20th. This individual is a close friend of President Roosevelt and is highly trusted, especially on financial issues. This appointment as chairman of the committee means that the practical review of concrete cases related to trade with Russia is important, not only in terms of the issue of diplomatic recognition but also in terms of trade relations.

<h3>French Air Force Squadron Leaves Moscow for Home</h3>

The hall displays various modern and state-of-the-art weapons possessed by the Soviet army. (20th, National Telegram) (Moscow) French Aviation Minister Cot and key members of the French aviation sector are still in Moscow.

<h3>Japanese Telegram Reports Soviet Russia Building Two Military Railways</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the "Tokyo News," Soviet Russia, due to the pressing situation in the Far East, has been intensifying the construction of the Baikal and Amur railways since September 1st, converting them into double-track lines to increase transportation capacity, with the goal of completing them this year. The Japanese military, upon hearing this news, feels greatly threatened. These two railways, due to the rugged terrain, were previously not highly valued by the Soviet authorities. However, for the sake of military operations against Japan, they are now actively constructing these lines in preparation for the Japanese and their puppet state to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway by force, at which time they can respond with military force. Moreover, if a Russian-Japanese war breaks out, it will become an important railway for military communication between Europe and Asia. (21st, China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Talks Between French and Polish Foreign Ministers Show Increasingly Close Relations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) After talks between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and Foreign Minister Pongou, a communiqué was issued stating that France and Poland shared completely the same views. The efforts of both sides to stabilize the European political situation and restore the economic conditions of the Danube River countries were also aligned. This can be seen from the state of the talks. Since Poland and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty, their relations have grown increasingly amicable. Poland's recent talks with the Free City of Danzig have been concluded, and an agreement has been reached, improving their friendship. Pongou and Beck both consider these two developments fortunate. Poland has direct interests in the Soviet Union and Danzig areas, and the progress of international relations there is greatly welcomed by both France and Poland. France and Poland are willing to maintain close contact at all times, especially in future international conferences, and so on. (21st, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Denies Inflation Rumors</h3>
<p>Controlled Production Promises Prosperity</p>
<p>Inflation Only a Last Resort</p>
<p>Chicago: U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, representing the government, today announced to the world in clear and forceful terms that the U.S. President's recovery plan is not based on inflating the currency and that inflation of the currency beyond the control of production, or other methods of regulating prices, will be extremely dangerous. This was done to dispel rumors of currency inflation and reassure the public. Wallace made these remarks while speaking at a meeting with grain merchants, stating that inflating the currency is not a panacea, and attempting to regulate prices without controlling production is a dangerous undertaking that will inevitably fail. The government is currently relying on expanding the purchasing power of the people to increase sales and return prices to their normal levels. He acknowledged that if the purchasing power of agricultural products cannot continue to increase within the next three months, the forces of price regulation and currency inflation in Congress will inevitably gain strength. However, he anticipates that purchasing power and the prices of agricultural products will soon increase greatly. Wallace then described the domestic situation in detail, asking everyone not to interfere with the current progress and pointing out that the U.S. government has not reduced the value of the gold dollar in its recovery plan, stating that there has never been such rapid progress in industry and commerce in U.S. history as there is today. We have started from the bottom of the economic recession and have made progress in the past six months that has never been seen in any previous period. The total amount of new work nationwide has increased by 65%, and the purchasing power of farmers alone has increased by 20%. Wallace then briefly discussed the international situation, saying that the American people still have a high tariff mentality and firmly believe that if the U.S. market is protected and production can be controlled, American industry can be restored. Finally, he stated that the American public has eliminated illusions about foreign investment and lending abroad and that it will be extremely difficult to raise foreign debt in the United States for some time to come. It is believed that this last statement indicates that the government wants to do everything possible to revitalize the domestic market. It is said that Wallace consulted with the President and obtained his approval before delivering his speech here. (30th, National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Leaving Room for British-American Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Washington) It was reliably reported here today that when British representative Lees-Smith comes to the United States next month to discuss revising war debts, the U.S. President and his advisors will propose to address all economic issues related to the two countries, and ask Britain to adopt the same currency inflation plan to raise prices. It is said that Agriculture Secretary Wallace's speech in Chicago today, stating that the U.S. government currently has no intention of ordering the inflation of the gold dollar, is to prepare the way for British-American negotiations and to stop speculation from abroad.

<h3>Reichstag Fire Trial</h3>
<p>Began Yesterday Morning in Leipzig</p>
<p>Foreign Lawyers Refuse to Appear in Court</p>
<p>Responsible to No One But the Law</p>
<p>Judge's Statement Arouses Considerable Attention</p>
<p>▲ National News Dispatch, Leipzig, 21st: The Reichstag fire trial began this morning at 9:00 AM in a tense atmosphere at the Supreme Court. Before the trial, the public and press gallery were already full, and those who came later continued to arrive in droves. Strict measures were used to control the crowd. Those entering the court were searched to prevent them from carrying weapons. Last night, French lawyer Pélissier addressed representatives of the world press at the Astoria Hotel in Leipzig, explaining the procedures taken by the German court in such cases. Pélissier quoted a section of the Weimar Constitution, saying that judges are responsible to no one but the law. The public paid great attention to this statement.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters Dispatch, Leipzig, 20th: On the eve of the Reichstag fire trial, Dr. Pélissier, who is in charge of the trial, issued a statement saying that Lubbe is the only culprit in the case and will be charged with arson. As for Torgler and the other three Bulgarian criminals, they will be charged with treason, and the Reichstag fire is only part of their crimes. Lubbe committed arson in the Reichstag, the city hall, the former Berlin Royal Palace, and the Public Security Bureau. Dr. Pélissier stated that the trial would be completely public and that we would not hide any events, but at the same time, he decided to maintain fairness and justice. There are 123 reporters attending the trial, 81 of whom are foreign reporters. Important testimonies in the case will be recorded and then broadcast to various places. Lubbe's defense lawyer, the Dutch lawyer Midderp, will not be allowed to appear in court.</p>
<p>Leipzig: Dr. Bunge, President of the Leipzig Higher Court, began the trial today of five people accused of arson in the Reichstag and treason. The fifth defendant, Lubbe, is only twenty-four years old, but when he appeared in court, he was hunched over and still in chains. The other four were not in shackles and were accompanied by seven plainclothes police officers. Dr. Bunge began by saying that the trial was of great importance to Germany and that the false trial in London and the foreign newspaper's remarks had hindered the trial of this case, which was regrettable. He then addressed the defendant Lubbe, informing him that the crime he was accused of carried the death penalty according to law. At this point, Lubbe began to be questioned.

The committee expressed complete innocence for the communists, and that the fifth defendant, Lubbe, is an anti-communist and could not have committed the crime alone.</p>
<p>Central Government Holds Memorial Meeting for Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom</p>
<h3>Shao Yuanchong Reports on the Significance of the Memorial</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial meeting for the martyr Zhu Zhixin at 8:00 AM on the 21st. Attendees included Central Committee members Chen Zhaoying, Xiao Jishan, Huang Jichen, Ye Chucang, Dai Chuanxian, Chu Minyi, Ju Zheng, Wang Maogong, Wang Luyi, Li Ciwen, Shao Yuanchong, Zhou Qigang, Ding Chao, Wang Yuqi, Dai Kuisheng, Ma Chaojun, Fan Yusui, Zeng Yangfu, Hong Ludong, Gu Zhengwang, Zhang Daofan, Chen Guofu, Jiao Yitang, Huang Fusheng, Jiang Zuobin, Fu Rulin, Jing Hengyi, Zeng Zhongming, Ke Xing'e, Gan Naiguang, Ji Zonghuang, Xiao Zhongzhen, Miao Peicheng, and representatives from various agencies, totaling over 600 people. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting, and Shao Yuanchong gave a report, stating that Mr. Zhu devoted his life to the revolution, so his entire life was a revolutionary life and his entire history was a revolutionary history. He had a strong characteristic in handling affairs and a calm attitude in facing events. Throughout his life, he diligently studied and sought knowledge, never slacking off. His research and scholarship were also extremely deep and thorough. Mr. Zhu's view of life was social, so he maintained a state of continuous progress. Life is dissatisfied with the present and seeks future improvement. The social revolutionary movement also arises from dissatisfaction with the status quo. In this way, all kinds of progress are created in the future culture and all other undertakings of society. Therefore, in society, people cannot stop seeking knowledge and striving for their careers, even for a moment, in order to have progress and improvement. Mr. Zhu followed this principle in both revolution and study. There is a famous saying that one should not forget to study in revolution, and one should not forget the revolution in study. We can say that Mr. Zhu was a revolutionary scholar and a scholar of revolution, which is perfectly appropriate. (21st, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives from all sectors of the capital held a memorial meeting for the 13th anniversary of Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom at the city party headquarters at 8:00 AM on the 21st.

<p>Question of Postponing the Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<h3>To Be Discussed Again in the Next Central Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the postponement of the Fifth National Congress, during the 21st Central Executive Committee meeting, President Wang reported on the discussions from the previous week concerning the postponement of the Fifth National Congress, requesting a decision from today's meeting. Many committee members expressed their opinions at the time. Some believed that the Central Executive Committee had the authority to decide whether or not to postpone the Fifth National Congress. If it was deemed necessary to postpone the congress, the Central Executive Committee could make the decision independently. Others argued that the proposal procedure was not legal and that Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and others, as Central Committee members, needed to submit a formal proposal to the Central Committee before it could be discussed by the Central Executive Committee. However, the majority argued that, given the current environment, postponing the Fifth National Congress was almost inevitable. The issue to be considered was how to make the procedure legal. As a result, the discussion was postponed to the next Central Executive Committee meeting next week. In addition, the overseas representatives of the Fifth National Congress, who had traveled a long way to Nanjing, were quite disappointed to hear about the postponement. In addition to sending a telegram expressing their disappointment, they also telegraphed the original party branches, expressing their extreme anger. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jinling Arsenal Test Bomb Explodes, Injuring Two Children</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the afternoon of the 21st, the Jinling Arsenal was testing artillery shells at Yuhuatai. One shell flew to Dongxiagou and exploded, injuring two children. One child, Xu Dayuan, 12 years old, was struck in the head by the shell, and his skull was blown open. He is likely beyond saving. The other child, Zhang Xiaoshan, 11 years old, had both arms blown off. The family carried them home and negotiated with the factory, but there has been no result. The evening newspaper commented on this case, saying that such a serious matter was only met with the official response of "awaiting handling" after the county public security bureau inspected the scene. This resulted in the injured victims being unable to be sent to the hospital and being carried home to die, a situation that is extremely tragic and inhumane. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Residential Area in Beijing Starts Construction, Implementing Land Acquisition</h3>

<h3>State-Run Sino-Russian Trade Organization Plan Shelved</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guo Chuntao of the Ministry of Industry stated, (1) The motivation for establishing a trade organization for Russia was that after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, imports of Russian goods increased rapidly, threatening to dump goods in the Chinese market. However, exports of Chinese goods to Russia have not been smooth due to various reasons. Therefore, it was planned to establish a special agency for trade with Russia to promote the mutual development of commerce between the two countries. The International Trade Bureau drafted a plan, but after the Soviet Russian ambassador came to Beijing, Minister Chen sought the ambassador's opinion. Unexpectedly, the Russian ambassador expressed disagreement, arguing that China had not established such a specialized trade organization for other countries, and that Russian goods imported into China did not exceed the records of other countries, nor was there any dumping behavior. The wording seemed quite high-sounding. As a result, the Ministry of Industry's original plan was shelved. It is difficult to predict whether it will be implemented in the future. There are rumors of seeking other relief measures for trade with Russia, but this is not true. (2) Organizing a business inspection group to Russia was proposed by the business community, requesting the Ministry to initiate a joint group to study the Soviet Russian five-year industrial plan for reference. However, this plan requires the participation of a considerable number of experts hired by the government; otherwise, it would be a superficial observation. Moreover, if this plan is implemented, it would be very costly. At the same time, it is necessary to consider whether the other party welcomes us to conduct inspections. This issue has various obstacles, making it very difficult to organize at this time. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Beiyang University Expels All Freshmen</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Ninety-six freshmen at Beiyang Institute of Technology, mostly from the Northeast, with a few from poor families, had requested tuition waivers, which were denied.

After mediation, it was decided that the two sides would meet in the auditorium at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Lei refused to apologize, and then denied that he had scolded anyone. The students asked, "Can you swear an oath?" Lei then loudly said, "If I scolded anyone, I am a bastard." The students then shouted "bastard" repeatedly. Lei resigned in shame and anger. President Li Shutian telegraphed the Ministry for instructions. At 6:00 AM on the 21st, he received a reply instructing him to expel all freshmen.

<h3>Japanese Army's Conspiracy Against Chahar</h3>
<p>Expanding the Situation Under the Pretext of the Guyuan Issue</p>
<p>Instigating Mongolian Princes and Nobles to Secretly Plan Autonomy</p>
<p>A Beiping dispatch states that the Japanese army is taking a two-pronged approach against Chahar. On one hand, they are expanding the situation under the pretext of the Guyuan issue. On the other hand, they are utilizing puppet and miscellaneous troops to occupy eastern Chahar and instigating the Mongolian princes and nobles of the Xilingol League to clamor for autonomy. Their conspiracy is becoming increasingly apparent. Regarding the incident where Koshiryo, the head of the Japanese Kwantung Army’s Special Service Agency in Chengde, sent airplanes to Zhangjiakou to distribute absurd leaflets, the Beiping authorities lodged a protest with Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy. Shibayama immediately telegraphed the Kwantung Army to convey this message. Last night, a reply telegram arrived in Beiping from the Kwantung Army, containing extremely arrogant wording. It also used the pretext that two Japanese residents had gone missing when Chinese troops entered Guyuan, insisting that troops should not be stationed east of Longguan and north of Zhangbei, and that Zhao Dengyu's troops must withdraw immediately. It is suspected that their intention is similar to the Shibamoto Incident, which was used as a pretext before the invasion of Rehe. After receiving the reply transmitted by Shibayama, the authorities continue to argue on the basis of reason and are planning a sound and comprehensive strategy for the aftermath in eastern Chahar. Song Zheyuan will return to Chahar only after the plan is agreed upon. However, it is heard that the Japanese army, in order to implement its Manchuria-Mongolia policy, is scheming against Chahar and is also planning to create a puppet organization in Chahar, gradually extending to Suiyuan. At the same time, they have not abandoned their long-standing conspiracy against North China, so our side urgently needs a comprehensive plan to deal with it.</p>
<p>The Mongolian Prince De and others of the Xilingol League in northern Chahar have recently been instigated by the Japanese to brew autonomy. On the 14th of this month, Prince De came forward to invite Prince So, Prince Zhuo, and others to hold a meeting in Bailing Temple. Few attended, and there were no concrete results. Recently, they issued a circular telegram, declaring the purpose of autonomy, while still expressing respect for the central government and the Three Principles of the People. However, they stated that they would implement autonomy based on Mr. Sun Yat-sen's outline for national construction. It is also heard that the princes are scheduled to hold another meeting in Pangjiang on the 28th of this month and have telegraphed Bai Yunti and other Mongolian representatives to return to Mongolia to jointly plan the progress. Their actions are absurd. Prince De and the Japanese side often have representatives coming and going. When Song Zheyuan returned to Chahar to take charge of the government, the Chahar provincial government was reorganized, and Princes De, So, and Zhuo were appointed as members of the provincial government. After the orders were issued, the central government and Song repeatedly telegraphed urging them to take office in Zhangjiakou. Prince De and others did not reply. At that time, Song already felt that something was amiss, and now their conspiracy is gradually revealed. The current authorities are paying unusual attention to this matter and are trying to appease them.</p>
<p>The situation in eastern Chahar is currently extremely complex. Li Shouxin's puppet army in Duolun was originally a regiment commander under Cui Xingwu. Now he has been promoted to the position of puppet army commander, with a strength of less than 10,000 men. Suo Huachen, who previously occupied Guyuan, was an old subordinate of Tang Yulin. He has also been promoted to the commander of the Second Puppet Army, with a strength of only 2,000 men. When Zhao Dengyu's troops entered Guyuan, there was a minor clash, and Suo immediately led his troops to flee. If the national army were to go and suppress them, it would not be a problem. However, they are sheltered by the Japanese, and any action would involve diplomacy, making it difficult to act for fear of hurting something else in trying to get at the rat. Tang Yulin's troops are now stationed between Chicheng and Longguan, in joint defense with Liu Guitang's troops. Although Tang has repeatedly sent representatives expressing his willingness to be incorporated, his actions are still suspicious. (September 19)</p>
<h3>Henan Province, Huoguo Bandits of Luyi Flee in Disarray</h3>
<p>The Bandits Set Fires Along the Way, Causing Great Devastation</p>
<p>County Magistrate Xu Xizhi Has Escaped Danger</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guide states that the Henan bandit Huo Guodong, originally under the command of the New 20th Division, had only about 500 men after the defection, with only over 300 rifles. Because they attacked and robbed everywhere, they gathered more and more followers, and their weapons and ammunition also gradually increased. The Kaifeng Pacification Commissioner's Office ordered the 52nd Division Commander Xia to be responsible for the pursuit and suppression. The division fought poorly and suffered great losses recently in Fangji, Taihe County. As a result, the bandits obtained a lot of weapons and ammunition, and their flames became more intense. At the same time, they joined forces with the Yang and Shi bandits, and their momentum became even greater. The number of men was about 8,000, with 4,000 to 5,000 rifles and nearly 1,000 horses. With this strength, the bandits crossed the river from Fangji, Taihe County, at 4:00 PM on September 12 and went straight to Luyi. They traveled about 100 li in one night and arrived at Luyi city at 4:00 AM on the 13th, immediately dividing their forces to besiege the four gates. The county only had five security teams. After sending three teams to the second and third districts for defense, there were only two teams in the city. In the end, they were outnumbered, and the county town was breached. County Magistrate Xu Xizhi was also captured. The bandits then opened the prison, released all the prisoners, and burned down the county government. The treasury was looted, and the people's homes were searched, with no one spared. The cash robbed was about 100,000 yuan, and the clothing was also about 100,000 yuan. The total public and private losses were no less than 300,000 yuan. Nearly 700 to 800 people were kidnapped. After the bandits satisfied their bestial desires, they left the city at 9:00 PM on the 14th and fled to Zaozi Village. The kidnapped people were also coerced and dragged away at the same time, either demanding cash, weapons, ammunition, or horses. As for County Magistrate Xu Xizhi, after being taken to Zaozi Village, he was asked to provide two dozen pistols, 400 rounds of ammunition, ten good horses, and 5,000 yuan in cash. If he did so, he would be released; otherwise, he would be shot. Xu refused to yield and replied, "I am the county magistrate and have the responsibility to defend the land and protect the people. Now that I have been captured, I will submit to whatever happens. As for the items you want, I cannot provide them. However, many poor people have been kidnapped. If you can release them, I will be content to be shot; I will have lived up to the people." At that time, the provincial government had sent cavalry to join the security team to pursue and suppress the bandits. At 3:00 PM on the 17th, the troops advanced to Zaozi Village and began to encircle and attack. The bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled in a panic to the northwest at 8:00 PM, setting fires along the way, spanning over 100 li. The flames lit up the sky. The hostages were dragged along at the same time, and countless died in the line of fire. It was indeed tragic. After the county magistrate was forced to break out, he rode away on horseback in Zhao Li Village. At 8:00 AM on the 18th, he arrived in Guide City and immediately telegraphed Chairman Liu in Kaifeng. The telegram read: "(Urgent to Kaifeng Chairman Liu Junjian). The Huo bandits number nearly 10,000 and attacked the city on the first of the month. I fought bravely to resist, but was ultimately outnumbered. The city fell and I was captured, trapped among the bandits for a week. Yesterday, I was forced to break out from Zaozi Village and escaped in the middle of the journey, arriving in Guide early this morning. I, in my official position, have been ineffective and unable to emulate the martyrs Yan Changshan and Zhang Suiyang in sacrificing myself for the people. The people have suffered this great calamity, and I bear the blame for the local area. I am duty-bound to resign. I earnestly request that I be severely punished to show condemnation. The aftermath of Luyi City urgently needs to be dealt with. Should I go to Bian to plead guilty or return to Luyi to resume my duties? Please advise. Your humble servant Xu Xizhi kowtows and seals.

<h3>Hankou Postal Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>The Post Office Recognizes the Union Organization</p>
<p>Seven Measures Agreed Upon by All Parties</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch states that the postal workers' strike in this city was resolved after Yu Senwen, director of the Labor Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Communications, came to Hankou and, together with Lu Jingshi and Zhao Shusen, standing committee members of the National Postal Workers' General Union, and Wu Shaoshu, a standing committee member of the Hankou City Party Headquarters, held repeated talks with Master Smith, the postmaster of the Postal Administration, and Liu Yaoting, the deputy postmaster. Their opinions gradually converged. The Bureau expressed its willingness to accept the recognition of the union organization and was also willing to discuss the improvement of employee benefits. Therefore, all parties consulted on the conditions and decided on seven measures: (1) The method of correspondence between the Bureau and the Union: Official letters from the Union to the Bureau will be accepted and processed by the Bureau, and when necessary, the Bureau will also reply with official letters. (2) The method of collecting membership fees on behalf: The Union will gather the request forms of all members and submit them to the Bureau. The Bureau will deduct the fees monthly and hand them over to the accountant designated by the Union for signature and receipt. (3) Subsidizing the Union's expenses: The principle is accepted, and the amount will be discussed at length. (4) Standing committee members of the Union will be granted special leave by the Bureau whenever they attend major conferences or preparatory meetings held by local party and government organs, or when it is necessary for union affairs. (5) The uniforms of the employees of the Hankou Bureau and the winter coats of the messengers and the raincoats of the coolies will be requested by the Union to the Administration Bureau and submitted to the General Bureau for issuance. (6) Executive and supervisory committee members of the Union cannot be transferred during their term of office. (7) Regarding those responsible for this incident, the authorities must not oppress or punish them for this reason in the future. After this method was decided, each mediator sought the consent of the Bureau and the Union. The Bureau immediately agreed. The Union, because it was a committee, had to hold a meeting to resolve it, so it convened a general meeting of representatives on the 20th to discuss it. Items 2 to 7 were accepted, while the first item was requested to be resolved by the National Postal Workers' General Union as a whole. The postal strike that had once taken place was completely quelled. Lu Jingshi and Zhao Shusen, with their mission completed, took a ship to Xun that evening and then went to Nanchang for inspection. Yu Senwen also returned to Beijing from Hankou to report the resolution to the Ministry of Communications. (September 20)</p>
<h3>Firearms Seized from Coffin in Songjiang</h3>
<p>Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, recently received a tip that bandits were gathering and stockpiling a large number of firearms in Xinqiao Panlong Bridge, and that they were plotting something. He dispatched a patrol boat, leading officers and police, to Panlong Bridge on the morning of the 20th for a secret investigation. No trace of bandits was found, but in the mounds of desolate tombs in the open field, he noticed a suspicious-looking coffin. He pried open the lid and found no corpse inside, but six rifles, nine flashlights, which shone brightly when pressed, were hidden inside. It was obvious that the bandits had hidden them in advance and were plotting to rob. District Chief Xu immediately took the seized firearms, flashlights, and other items back to the district headquarters on the original ship, and secretly investigated the traces of the bandits, captured them, and brought them to justice to ensure the safety of the residents.</p>
<h3>Gentry of Various Counties in Suzhou Oppose Perpetual Tenancy Deed Tax</h3>
<p>Wang Qingmu, Tang Wenzhi, Zhang Yichen, and other gentry from various counties in Jiangsu sent telegrams to the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the ministers of finance and interior, regarding the Suzhou Provincial Government's collection of the perpetual tenancy deed tax, saying: The Suzhou Provincial Government has decided to announce the regulations for the collection of the tenancy right deed tax, and the rules for the collection have been published in detail in the newspapers, and will be strictly enforced immediately. It is illegal and disturbs the people, and the public is furious. At a time when rural bankruptcy has become a reality, collecting five jiao of perpetual tenancy deed tax per mu is tantamount to kicking a man when he is down and putting the exhausted farmers to death. Such retrograde behavior by the Suzhou government is worrying about future troubles. I hereby telegraph to you earnestly, requesting that you conduct a thorough investigation and order the cancellation.</p>
<h3>Detective in Taicang Frames Man as Bandit Out of Jealousy</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoan, a detective in Taicang, competed with Yu Junhai for He Guixiang, the wife of the deceased bandit leader Pan Kaiwu, and falsely accused Yu Junhai of being a bandit in the county. After the county government's interrogation, it consulted the Taicang County Government. On the 18th, it received a reply from County Magistrate Hong stating that Wang Xiaoan was indeed a detective with a handwritten warrant, also issued by Xia Chungan, the director of the Public Security Bureau. However, whether Yu Junhai had committed a banditry case could not be ascertained. The county government believed that Wang Xiaoan was using his position for personal gain and transferred him to the court for handling.</p>
<h3>Doctor Kidnapped in Wuxi, No Money for Ransom</h3>
<p>Zhu Yunting, a famous doctor in Qianwang, Second District (Jingyun City), currently runs a clinic in Beizhakou. On the 15th of this month, he went to Hu Ronglin's house in Liutan Bridge Village in the Sixth District to see a patient. That night, he returned to the city by boat. When the boat passed Yaohuatan, about two li north of Gaochang Bank, it was suddenly attacked by four or five bandits, who kidnapped Zhu Yunting, the boatman Zhou Afu, and the patient's wife Hu Linshi together. The next day, Zhou Afu and Hu Linshi were released from the bandits' den and returned home safely, but Zhu Yunting was left on the bandits' boat. The bandits sent a letter to Zhu's family, demanding 10,000 yuan in cash, three catties of beef, three cans of red pills, three taels of opium, and 50 packs of Meinong brand cigarettes, specifying Zhangtang Bridge near Sitou as the meeting point. After receiving the letter, Zhu's family was extremely anxious and prepared the above items, sending someone to contact the bandits. Sure enough, they saw a bandit waiting there. The messenger told them that it was difficult to raise the money and asked to reduce the ransom, but the bandits refused, so there was no result. After seeing the news, the county government sent Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political affairs and police, to investigate the scene of the incident and reported the investigation situation to the provincial government for verification yesterday. At the same time, it ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Police Brigade to strictly arrest the bandits and bring them to justice, and to rescue the hostage. Li Junjian, the director of the 13th Public Security Sub-bureau in charge, also reported the investigation situation to the General Bureau for verification. It was also heard that Zhu Yunting had been ill for two months recently and had just recovered. He had been seeing patients for only two weeks. Now that he had been kidnapped, it was feared that he would become ill again due to depression. Zhu's family was troubled by economic difficulties, and after much thought, they could find no way out, so the ransom issue was very difficult. They could only cry all day long, which was heartbreaking. When Zhu was kidnapped, the boatman Zhou Afu had several front teeth knocked out by the bandits with a gun, but his injuries were minor, which was also fortunate. It was also heard that the bandits were remnants of the party of Wang Junzhi, a communist leader who had already been executed. They had planned to kidnap surgeon Zhu Shucheng, but failed, so they kidnapped Zhu Yunting instead. Zhu's family was afraid that the bandits would tear up the ticket and insisted that they did not want to report to the authorities for arrest.</p>
<h3>Zhang Weihan Visits Wuxi for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Zhang Weihan, a member of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, went to Suzhou from Beijing with his wife and servant a few days ago to visit his in-laws, and visited the scenic spots in Suzhou along the way. Yesterday, he came to Wuxi from Suzhou to visit the scenic spots such as Meiyuan and Turtle Head Isle, and Wanqing Hall. It is heard that Zhang did not bring any attendants on this trip to Wuxi, and it was purely for sightseeing purposes, with no mission. He is expected to return to Beijing today.</p>
<h3>School Collapses in Shangyu, Many Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, when classes were in session at the private Jinlei Primary School in the Cross Street in the city, two beams in the third-grade classroom suddenly collapsed, and the rafters followed suit. Most of the students in the classroom were injured. The police of the Public Security Bureau helped the hired workers to excavate two large piles of rubble and counted the number of injured people. In addition to student Luo Baihai, who died of severe head and chest injuries, there were 19 people who were injured in the head, arms, chest, and back, including Xie Lianqing, Xie Youquan, Fan Heyuan, Zhao Chongzhen, Xu Guihua, Wang Yongyuan, Shen Tongfu, Zhao Fengxian, and Chen Hongshun. Ge Weisheng from Weisheng Hospital rushed to treat them and carried them to the families of the students separately. When the relatives of the deceased and the families of the students heard the news and rushed to the scene, there were many complaints. After the police maintained order, the situation calmed down. As for the cause of the accident, the school was borrowing the Hu family ancestral hall, which had been in disrepair for many years. The two beams on the roof could not bear the weight, resulting in the collapse. Fortunately, when the huge beams tilted down, the students ran out of the classroom first, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Suffers Hurricane Disaster</h3>
<p>Ningbo was hit by a hurricane again at 1:00 PM on the 18th. The intensity of the wind was unprecedented. Electric poles were broken and all the lights in the city went out. At the same time, telephone and telegraph communications were cut off. At night, the river water rose sharply, and the losses along the river were particularly heavy. By 8:00 AM the next day (the 19th), the wind gradually subsided and finally calmed down. The disaster situation in various places is recorded as follows: (1) Countless houses, walls, and electric poles were blown down in Jiangbei. Five shops from 120 to 125 Xinma Road were completely blown down by the strong wind. Fortunately, the residents escaped in the wind and rain in the middle of the night, avoiding disaster. Along the Jiangbei shore and Tongxing Street on the Bund, the river tide surged, and the water was deep enough to reach the abdomen. The boats tied along the river floated to the shore. The China Merchants Bureau and the Swire Shipping Company's warehouses were flooded, and the sugar bags and cotton stored in the warehouses were soaked. The losses of the two warehouses exceeded 10,000 yuan. (2) Under the strong winds and surging river currents, seven large boats hit the old Jiang Bridge, causing the Jiang Bridge's iron cable to be broken and the pontoon bridge to be scattered. It has not yet been repaired. More than 20 Baiguan boats docked at the Daxing Company wharf on Binjiang Road were overturned. The flour and other items loaded on the boats were washed away by the waves, with a total loss of tens of thousands of gold. (3) Five flat houses in Dongsheng Huachi Alley, Jiangdong, were blown down by the wind. Ye Qingyu, a resident of the house, was crushed to death, and his son Ye Jiafa was seriously injured. Twenty new houses built in Taiping Alley were not yet fully completed and were all blown down by the strong wind yesterday. Ren Afu, a worker living on the upper floor of the house, was crushed to death, and three others were seriously injured. Near Xianqian Street, electric poles were broken and power lines fell to the ground during the strong winds last night. Gu Ahe, a rickshaw puller, accidentally touched the power lines and died on the spot. The temporary wooden workshop near Qinglindu on Yinci Town Road was blown down on the night of the 18th. Chen Hongfu, the elder brother of Chen Honggui, the contractor, was unable to escape and was crushed to death on the spot. In addition, the water rose more than ten feet in the city of Yuyao, in the area of Zhire Street, Zuiliang Bridge, Dongtai Gate, Dongbudu, and Houqing Gate. The kitchens of the people's homes were submerged in water, and livestock such as chickens and ducks were drowned. The Xinjianhu steamship, which runs between Yuyao and Shangyu, set sail from Yao City to Shangyu the day before yesterday. When it reached Qixingpu, a hurricane suddenly struck, and the ship could not withstand it, resulting in it being overturned. All 16 passengers were drowned in the river. The body of one of the drowned passengers, Yu Tingkang, has not yet been recovered.</p>

<h3>Appeals for Relief from Wind Disasters in Various Places</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Party Headquarters of Wusong sent a telegram to the Municipal Government, saying: Urgent, Shanghai Mayor Wu Junjian, the typhoon crossed the border on the Qiao day, and the sea tides flooded. The Wusong seawall has many dangers, especially in the Wumufeng area. The municipal party committee of the district has repeatedly urged the Bureau of Public Works to repair it as soon as possible to prevent the tide. Although the Bureau of Public Works has sent people to inspect, it has not yet started construction. It is probably because the project is not large, so it is neglected. It must be known that small gaps can cause great disasters, just like a spark can start a prairie fire. The Bureau of Public Works is responsible for the dangers this time. When the typhoon was in danger, the gentry of the district were panic-stricken and led the villagers to rescue the old and the dead overnight. Fortunately, the wind changed direction in the afternoon, and they were able to protect themselves. However, eighty to ninety percent of the seawall has been washed away. Otherwise, not only would Shanghai become a swamp, but Suzhou and Wuxi would also be in danger, and the disaster would be unimaginable. Now that the typhoon has passed, the great tides of the eighth lunar month, the third and eighteenth days of the old calendar, are approaching. If we do not find a way to rush to block them, it will be difficult to protect them. The association is near and sees and hears more clearly, and it is difficult to sit idly by. Dare to telegraph to Your Excellency, quickly order the Bureau of Public Works to start construction on a specific day to prevent danger. I hope that you will not regard the lives of millions of people as child's play. The Executive Committee of the Eighth District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Yinxiang</h3>
<p>Since the second typhoon swept through Shanghai, the rural areas have been heavily affected. Yesterday, Wang Shijie, Wang Sigao, Tang Lansheng, Tang Jinshan, and other farmers from the Yinxiang District near Shanghai University went to the Municipal Government to request relief. According to them, the most severely affected area in the district is the five and nineteen maps. The embankments were collapsed by the flood, and more than 100 houses were collapsed. Most of the harvested rice was lost. The damage is more serious than the previous time. The water has not yet receded, and it is almost knee-deep in deep places. The victims in the district have nowhere to live, and food and clothing are especially difficult. As for the livestock, firewood, and other sundries that were washed away by the water, they are too numerous to mention. For this reason, they are extremely anxious and have formed a relief request group, earnestly requesting the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs, Finance, and Public Works Bureaus to send personnel to conduct on-site surveys, quickly repair the embankments, provide relief to the victims, and reduce and exempt grain taxes to alleviate the people's hardship. It is heard that the Municipal Government has ordered the relevant bureaus in charge to actively engage in relief work.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Nanhui County was hit by another hurricane on the evening of the 18th of this month. The hurricane struck the territory of Nanhui County, from Sanzhao in the Fourth District in the south to Qituan in the north, covering a distance of about 70 li. The Li and Wang embankments were washed away, with as many as 20 breaches. The water was more than five feet deep, and the houses were in ruins. There were more than 20,000 victims, and dozens of people have drowned. The tragic situation of the victims is difficult to describe in words. County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo issued a letter last night inviting philanthropists to gather at the Atlantic Ocean Hotel to discuss emergency relief measures. More than 50 people attended, including Du Yuesheng, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Shoushan, Huang Renzhi, Gu Bowei, and Jiang Zhuoyun. Chairman Yuan, the county magistrate, begged the philanthropists for relief on the spot, and Zhang Longjiang, a standing member of the county party headquarters, reported on the disaster situation. Next, Du Yuesheng proposed that the disaster situation in Nanchuan this time was very serious, and the relief measures must be systematic. The audience unanimously agreed and decided to quickly organize the Pudong Emergency Relief Committee and first set up several porridge distribution stations. Then, Lu Bohong and Lu Wenshao gave speeches, and Shen Zijian reported on the investigation of the disaster situation. The meeting adjourned at 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Chuansha</h3>
<p>The coastal area of Chuansha suffered a disastrous wind tide on the evening of the 18th. County Magistrate Li Leng has telegraphed the Provincial Government, the Civil Affairs Department, the Construction Department, and the Provincial Relief Committee, etc. separately. The message reads (excerpt above): This county, unfortunately, suffered another hurricane disaster following the previous one. Wind and rain raged, and the storm surge surged violently, especially severely at night. The force was like overturning mountains and toppling seas, seemingly even more intense than in winter. Several coastal protective embankments were also damaged, and telephone poles and lines were completely broken. (Photo by Li Zunyong) Temporary shelters for disaster victims.</p>
<p>In the west, the waters of the Huangpu River overflowed, and the railway bridges of the Shanghai-Chuansha Automobile Company north of Caojia Road were all submerged. In some places, the tracks were washed away, and traffic was blocked. Hengsha Island is isolated in the sea, and it is suffering another calamity after the previous disaster. The severity of the disaster need not be stated. However, separated by the sea, there is no way to fly across. Looking at the raging waves, I feel extremely anxious. Although the wind has weakened slightly until now, it is still raging. In addition to ordering the chief of technical affairs and the district chiefs of the fourth and fifth districts to do their best to patrol and protect the seawalls and gather laborers to rush to repair them, so as to prevent the disaster area from expanding, I am sending this urgent telegram. Detailed information about the disaster will be reported later. Li Leng, County Magistrate of Chuansha and Chairman of the Relief Committee, bows respectfully.</p>
<h3>All Circles in the City Commemorated Zhu Zhixin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Held a Memorial Meeting at the City Party Headquarters</p>
<p>Attended by More Than Two Hundred Representatives from All Circles</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters convened a memorial meeting for the 13th anniversary of the martyrdom of the late Mr. Zhu Zhixin at 10:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium on the third floor, gathering various city agencies, organizations, and subordinate district party headquarters and branch offices. The meeting was presided over by Xing Wan, a member of the City Party Headquarters, with Ye Guanqian as the master of ceremonies, and adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Order of Commemoration</h3>
<p>(1) Opening; (2) Singing the Party Song; (3) Paying the Highest Respects to the National Flag, the Party Flag, and the Portrait of the Premier; (4) The Chairman Reverently Reads the Premier's Last Will; (5) Three Minutes of Silence; (6) Chairman's Report; (7) Speeches; (8) Shouting Slogans; (9) Adjournment.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>Those who participated in the memorial meeting included Yao Yunbo from the Municipal Supervisory Committee, Li Ze from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhang Menglin from the Diplomatic Ministry's Shanghai Office, Hu Xiong from Jiaotong University, Chen Zhongfu from Jinan University, Shao Xubai from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Zhang YunJun from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Lu Muge from the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Shui Xiangyun from the Postal Workers' Union, Zhang Huichun from the South Shanghai District Farmers' Association, Ji Guiquan from the First District Carpenters' Union, Yu Yaoqiu from the Dried Goods Industry Workers' Union, Gao Defang from the Garment Industry Union, Zhu YaKui from the Labor Education Committee, Song Ye from the Fourth District Rubber Industry Union, Chen Xiugao from the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, and over two hundred others.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the formalities, the Chairman delivered a report, stating briefly that today is the 13th anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Zhu Zhixin. When we commemorate the predecessors, there must be commemorative value. The standard of its value is based on whether or not there is the revolutionary spirit and personality of the Premier. We will analyze Mr. Zhu's revolutionary personality and spirit: (1) Mr. Zhu, from childhood to adulthood, never slacked off in seeking knowledge. This is completely the same as the Premier's spirit of diligent study. (2) In the past few years, we often see that ordinary people often only know revolution and do not know how to seek knowledge, or only know how to seek knowledge and do not know revolution. It must be known that revolution and the pursuit of knowledge are inseparable. The Premier has elaborated on this matter in his posthumous writings, "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Easy." The Premier regards seeking knowledge as revolution, not like ordinary people who seek knowledge for the sake of knowledge. After Mr. Zhu participated in the revolution, he followed this spirit. (3) Although Mr. Zhu was very knowledgeable, he did not blindly follow. During his lifetime, the Premier studied various doctrines, various theories, and the political and economic systems of various countries, but what the Premier created was the Three Principles of the People, which were unprecedented in various countries. Mr. Zhu also had this kind of spirit. Mr. Dai Jitao once said that Mr. Zhu first studied Nietzsche's transcendental philosophy but did not become Nietzsche, and then studied Marx's materialistic philosophy but did not become Marx. This is because Mr. Zhu had his firm and indomitable confidence. The reason why he studied various theories was to broaden his horizons and use them for reference. If today's general scholars learn Adam Smith's theories, they become the running dogs of capitalists; if they learn Marx's theories, they become the running dogs of communists. One is to use theories, and the other is to be used by theories. Today, some people advocate fascism. We believe that it is not impossible to choose the advantages of fascism to restore the past revolutionary spirit of our party, but it must be able to be used by us. (4) Mr. Zhu's spirit of revolutionary courage is especially unforgettable for us. When the Huanghuagang Uprising took place, the first to charge into the Governor's Office was Huang Kecheng, and the second was Zhu Zhixin. This spirit of revolutionary courage is immortal and should be emulated by our fellow comrades who died later. Unfortunately, Mr. Zhu did not die in this disaster but died after the revolutionary forces had unified Guangdong, being harmed by reactionaries. This is really regrettable for us. If Mr. Zhu were still alive today, there would be an amazing career to be seen. We commemorate Mr. Zhu's martyrdom a few days after commemorating the September 18th Incident. We must deeply imprint Mr. Zhu's revolutionary thoughts in our minds and should emulate Mr. Zhu's spirit of diligent study, etc. After the Chairman's report, Yang Dean, a representative from the University Alliance, gave a speech, roughly to emulate Mr. Zhu's revolutionary and courageous spirit to resist the violent Japanese.</p>
<h3>Slogans and Banners</h3>
<p>Slogans: 1. Mr. Zhu was a loyal follower of the Premier. 2. Mr. Zhu was a creator of the Republic of China. 3. Inherit Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit. 4. Emulate Mr. Zhu's great personality. 5. Mr. Zhu's spirit is immortal. 6. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. 7. Long live the Republic of China. Banners: 1. To commemorate Mr. Zhu Zhixin, we must step up political tutelage and construction. 2. Emulate Mr. Zhu's great and noble personality. 3. Mr. Zhu was a loyal follower of the Premier. 4. Emulate Mr. Zhu's integrity and build an honest government. 5. Emulate Mr. Zhu's spirit of hard work in learning. 6. To commemorate Mr. Zhu, we must work hard to suppress the Red bandits and stabilize society.</p>
<h3>Preparation Fund for Repaying Debts on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>To Increase to 7.5% Next Month</p>
<p>Although the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration's business has not been very prosperous this year due to the current situation, it has already repaid more than 3.21 million yuan in arrears as a result of its efforts to rectify the situation. This is unprecedented in the history of the two railways. It is reported that the funds borrowed from the Bank of Communications by the railway authorities were originally scheduled to be repaid in installments. As of the end of September this year, the principal has been repaid. It is planned to transfer the monthly installment of 25,000 yuan to the Bank of Communications to increase the reserve for repayment of loans from the British and Chinese Corporation from October 1. The method is to increase the amount of special reserves from 5% to 7.5%. This has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval and will be implemented once approved.</p>

<h3>Yu Hongjun Discusses Two Cases of Negotiation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun informed us yesterday of the latest progress on the factory inspection issue in the Shanghai concessions and the Haig Road police power negotiation case in the French Concession as follows:</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the factory inspection issue in the Public Concession, after several negotiations between Yu and Fei, the principles have been agreed upon in principle. However, the Municipal Council still needs to be passed by the board of directors. Although the board of directors of the Municipal Council had already brought it up for discussion the day before yesterday, the result was still handed over to Fei to continue negotiations with our side. There is still no concrete resolution on the various agreed principles. Yu said that the attitude of the Concession authorities on this matter is now awaiting Fei's reply. Therefore, Yu and Fei will have further consultations in the near future in the hope of resolving this case as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Police Power Negotiation Case</h3>
<p>Regarding the Haig Road police power negotiation case in the French Concession, after the Municipal Government sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to file a written protest to French Consul General Meyrier, the French Consul General has already replied, but it still cannot satisfy our side. As for the incidents that have occurred repeatedly in that area, the French Concession often has the suspicion of interfering across the border. This matter is detrimental to our national sovereignty, so the Municipal Government must correct this matter, etc.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Shanghai Office Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lang Shangguanpu Going to Peiping Today or Tomorrow to Meet Ma</p>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan's Shanghai office closed yesterday. Lang Shangguanpu, who was in charge of the office, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the north to Peiping today or tomorrow. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Lang yesterday and learned about General Ma's recent situation and future actions. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to Lang, General Ma established an office in Shanghai to focus on efficiency and handle all the aftermath matters so that they could be concluded as soon as possible. Now that all the aftermath matters have been completed one after another, the office here has been announced to be closed as of today (the 21st). All the office staff have returned to their original homes separately. I am scheduled to leave Shanghai for Peiping tomorrow or the day after (i.e., today or tomorrow) to meet General Ma and report back, and then stay in Peiping to prepare for convening a memorial service for the fallen soldiers and dead civilians who resisted Japan in Heilongjiang, and plan to build a memorial tower in Peiping to commemorate the soldiers and civilians of Heilongjiang who died for their country.</p>
<h3>General Ma Decided to Reside in Peiping for a Long Time</h3>
<p>General Ma has been in Peiping for several days and has now decided to reside in Peiping for a long time and will not go south for the time being, because General Ma has lived in the north for a long time and is not accustomed to the water, soil, and climate of the south. The old troops left behind by General Ma, from the two division commanders Li Zhongyi and Tan Zixin down to the various senior generals, have now arrived in Peiping one after another to meet Ma and ask for instructions, so as to reorganize and replenish them and wait for the central government to reorganize them. As for Xinjiang, General Ma originally had no old troops there.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Refugees Urgently Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, two years have passed. The people of the Northeast do not want to be subjugated and obedient people, and those who have fled into Guan have reached hundreds of thousands one after another. The people of the Northeast have never had any cash savings. Those with surplus assets have used them to buy property and do business. Now, once they flee into Guan as refugees, they are all destitute, resulting in young people dropping out of school, adults being unemployed, and the old and weak being on the verge of starvation. If they are not given relief, they will be forced to take risks. In view of this, the central government is preparing to organize a Northeast Refugee Relief Committee to rescue the people of the Northeast from the abyss of misery and bring them to a comfortable life. However, the preparatory work has been completed, and there is no definite date for its establishment. The refugee relief plan drafted by the preparatory committee has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for a month, but has not yet been submitted to the Central Political Council for approval and implementation. Before I go north, my only wish is that the central government will provide relief to the people of the Northeast as soon as possible, which would be a great blessing.</p>
<h3>Request to Hold Ship Officer Examination in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Pilots' Association Pours Out Reasons</p>
<p>Please Extend Trial Period by One Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the recent increase in the number of merchant ships that have had accidents and the frequent collisions with civilian ships that have resulted in tragedies, clearly shows that the knowledge and skills of the engine drivers and machinists are not pure, and there are many who are just making up the numbers. The responsibility of crew members in the shipping industry is great, and without rich experience, they cannot bear the burden of safe navigation. In order to emphasize the strict screening of crew members, Minister Zhu has specifically scheduled the crew examination to be held in the second ten days of October. The Shanghai Pilots' Association has requested that the examination be moved to Shanghai. The situation is described below:</p>
<h3>Scheduled Examination for Crew Members</h3>
<p>In the past, when personnel in the engine driver and machinist departments applied for certificates from the Ministry of Communications, they only needed to list their experience and school of origin, and provide a certificate from the hiring company, and they could pay the fee and receive the crew certificate. Generally, a shipowner's certificate costs more than 40 yuan, and the second mate's certificate is reduced in turn. The same applies to the machinist section, but in order to correct the past errors of indiscriminately issuing certificates, the Ministry of Communications has implemented a new chapter on the examination and screening of crew members for certification, starting from October 1 this year. The Ministry has already prepared for the examination affairs, and the dates are from October 24 to 27, a total of three days of examinations. The crew members who should take the examination have been transferred and ordered by the Ministry to the Pilots' and Machinists' Associations, and they must arrive in Beijing before the 24th to be prepared for the examination at that time. Those who pass the examination will be issued certificates. The Ministry has already designated many shipping merchants and marine experts as examiners.</p>
<h3>Request to Move Examination to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Pilots' Association of this port is the only organization for Chinese crew members. Upon receiving this order, it considered that the examination location was in the capital and only lasted for three days, which was not enough time to rush to take the examination. Yesterday, the association decided to submit a request to the Ministry to extend the examination period and move it to Shanghai, stating briefly that the ship officers examination will be held from October 24 for three consecutive days, and those who pass will be given certificates. The examination for ship officers is to carefully select navigators to ensure maritime safety, which is admirable. However, the personnel taking this examination have special circumstances and cannot be compared with a single examination. The following is submitted to the Ministry: (1) The examination site should be selected in Shanghai. Most of the examinees serve on merchant ships, so it is difficult to leave their posts at will. Setting up the examination in the capital would take a lot of time to travel back and forth. If a large number of crew members take leave at the same time to take the examination, it will inevitably hinder the navigation of merchant ships, which will not only be inconvenient for the crew members but also affect navigation affairs. Shanghai is a concentrated area for ships on the North and South Seas and the Yangtze River. If the examination is moved to Shanghai, the crew members can take advantage of the opportunity to berth at the port to take the examination, so that there will be no obstacles for both the shipping industry and the crew members. This is why the examination site should be selected in Shanghai. (2) The examination date must be extended. The sailing dates of merchant ships are all pre-determined, so the dates of berthing at ports vary. If the examination period is only three days, how can the examinees stop and berth within this date? This is practically impossible. It is requested that the Ministry extend the examination for one month, during which they can take the examination as they arrive, so that both the crew members and navigation affairs can be taken care of. It is reasonable to submit this request for consideration, which is a public feeling. This is submitted to the Ministry of Communications by the Shanghai Merchant Ship Pilots' Association.</p>
<h3>The Emei Wheel Escaped Danger and Changed to the Beijing-Hankou Express Wheel</h3>
<p>Lasted Eight Weeks</p>
<p>Cost Up to More Than 80,000 Yuan</p>
<p>丨The Emei Wheel is About to be Towed to Shanghai for Overhaul丨</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's upper Yangtze wheel Emei, after running aground and sinking in Fuzhou in late July, was salvaged by a special commissioner sent by the Bureau to the area to find a way. It took two months and cost 90,000 yuan. It was not until yesterday that they were able to report by telegram that it had been raised and is expected to be towed to Shanghai for overhaul soon. The Bureau also plans to open a new route to expand its Yangtze River business. The details learned by the reporter are as follows:</p>
<h3>The Ship's Body Sank into the Reef</h3>
<p>The Emei wheel left Chongqing on July 28 and headed for Hankou. When it was near Pingquan Beach in Fuzhou, the wheel ran into a reef due to the turbulent current when the Yangtze River was rising. The head, second, and third holds were completely broken, and the front half of the hull was trapped in the chaotic rocky beach of Pingquan Beach after the river water rushed in. The situation was extremely dangerous. Hundreds of attempts to salvage it at that time ended in failure. The Bureau considered that the ship cost 400,000 taels and should not be abandoned lightly, so it ordered Deputy Chief Captain Shen Jiyun to supervise and design the salvage, and to rescue the hull.</p>
<h3>Water Recedes, Dismantling Various Parts</h3>
<p>Shen Jiyun arrived in Fuzhou and met with Captain Ji Qingrong and the director of the Chongqing Branch to carry out a salvage plan. They rented a wheel from Minsheng Company and hired a large number of workers to go to Pingquan Beach to remove the goods first. Later, the upstream river water receded greatly, and the Emei wheel became stranded high in the rocky piles on the beach. At that time, it was generally believed that it would not be possible to rescue it within the year and that it would have to wait for the river to rise next spring before it could be salvaged. Therefore, workers were ordered to dismantle all the equipment and buildings in the ship and destroy the reefs around the ship during low tide, then repair the broken holes, and then use a small wheel to lift the front hull of the Emei wheel from the sand and mud during the second rise of the river water after the 20th of last month to make it float smoothly. The eight-week project was finally successful.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Success of Rescue</h3>
<p>During these two months, the Bureau paid a total of tens of thousands of yuan for the Emei wheel's rescue costs and various construction costs, which were paid and remitted one after another. Now the hull has been rescued from the chaotic reefs on the 18th of this month and is floating on the river. Among the objects dismantled from the ship, a radio was installed first and has been connected to Shanghai and Taiwan by telegram yesterday. According to Shen Jiyun's report, the Emei salvage was successful and will be raised soon. As soon as it is introduced into the river, it will be towed back to Shanghai and enter the dock for overhaul. General Manager Liu was very happy to receive this telegram. It was unexpected that the ship, which could not be rescued, was rescued safely. Now, after some installations, it will be towed to Shanghai for overhaul.</p>
<h3>Opening the Beijing-Hankou Express Service</h3>
<p>The Emei ship has a deadweight of 1,076 tons and was built in the Jiangnan Factory in 1920. The machinery is excellent, with 3,000 horsepower and can travel 13 nautical miles per hour, making it the fastest ship among the Yangtze River wheels. It originally ran on the Yichang-Chongqing route. Recently, the number of direct Chongqing ships in Shanghai has been increasing, and the Sichuan River shipping industry has become exhausted. The Bureau sent personnel to inspect the Yangtze River shipping industry last time and concluded that the number of first-class passengers traveling to and from the Beijing-Hankou route has been increasing recently, which is different from the situation in previous years. If the Emei wheel is converted to the Beijing-Hankou direct express service, it can travel from Nanjing to Hankou in two days, which will definitely develop the business and open a new era of fast shipping wheels on the Yangtze River. Liu Hongsheng has decided on this proposal and will report the reasons for opening this new route to the Board of Directors for approval, and then transfer it to the Ministry of Communications. This is also a special situation in the Yangtze River shipping wheel industry.</p>
<h3>Swedish Prince Visits Shenxin No. 5 Factory</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, Swedish Prince Carl, accompanied by a group of four people including the consul and counselor, visited Shenxin No. 5 Cotton Mill on Gaolang Bridge, Yangshupu, accompanied by Mr. Lu Runzao of Weichang Foreign Company.

<p>Xiong Yuan, technician Rong Baochun, and Hu Qingsheng, head of the personnel department, gave a cordial reception. Carl praised the factory's excellent products and comprehensive equipment. Before leaving, the factory presented various 30th anniversary publications and yarn samples, and took photos as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Lin Wo Jiang Went to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Participate in the Naming Ceremony of Zhejiang Save the Nation Aircraft</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Save the Nation aircraft was originally scheduled to hold a naming ceremony at the Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport on the 18th. Lin Wo Jiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, was invited to assist in the preparations. However, due to the continuous heavy rain and muddy ground, it could not be held as scheduled. Lin returned to Shanghai immediately to preside over the affairs of the Aviation Association. It is now learned that the aircraft has been rescheduled to hold the naming ceremony at Jianqiao Airport on the 21st (yesterday) and has sent a telegram urging Lin to go. After receiving the telegram, Lin took the express train to Hangzhou at 7:25 yesterday morning to participate.</p>
<h3>Chilean Consul General in Shanghai Paid a Visit to Mayor Wu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Purely a Courtesy Visit</p>
<p>The Chilean Consul General in Shanghai was originally concurrently held by Segremont, the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires in China. The Chilean government now believes that since Segremont also serves as the Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, he will not have time to take care of the duties of Consul General. Therefore, it has transferred the Consul in Guangzhou, Smait, to be the Consul General in Shanghai. Smait arrived in Shanghai from Guangzhou the day before yesterday to take office and paid a visit to Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government on Fenglin Bridge at 10:40 yesterday morning. Mayor Wu and Secretary Tang Tuxuan personally received him, and they talked for about 20 minutes. Smait then left. It is reported that Smait's visit to Mayor Wu yesterday was purely a courtesy visit.</p>

<h3>The Anti-War Association Awaits a Telegram from Paris</h3>
<p>Decision on Whether to Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that, according to the delegation led by Lord Marley, after receiving the Shanghai Municipal Council's reply refusing to hold a meeting in the International Settlement, the Anti-War Association will cable its headquarters in Paris last night or this morning for instructions on whether the representatives should hold a meeting in other Pacific ports, or simply give up and return home. The decision will depend on the reply from Paris, which is expected to arrive in about ten days. If the meeting does not take place, the individual or joint actions of the representatives have not yet been decided. However, Lord Marley will go to Siberia to inspect the Jewish colony, which was given by Soviet Russia.

<h3>Zhenhai County Sends a Telegram to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association</h3>
<p>To the Ningbo natives in Shanghai from all fellow townsmen in Zhenhai, may it please you. Our county has been suffering from a hurricane and torrential rain since the 21st, day and night, uprooting trees and collapsing houses, cutting off transportation. The sea tide surged furiously, and the water on both the north and south banks of the river was five or six feet deep, forming a disaster scene. The situation is more dangerous than the autumn of the 20th year and Dongri this month. The county magistrate led the head of the construction section and the head of the public security bureau of the militia unit, inspecting the seawall at night. Fortunately, the construction project was solid and did not cause a major change. More than a dozen places inside and outside the county government, as well as in the militia unit and the prison, suffered collapsed walls and houses. This morning the wind force has slightly decreased, and the tide has gradually receded. After inspecting outside Ximen again, only a vast ocean was seen. The area northwest of the outer city is still flooded with three or four feet of water. About a hundred houses have collapsed on both sides of the river in Jiangnan and Jiangbei, and many walls have collapsed. Many boats along the river have also been washed away and are being investigated. In addition to separately ordering detailed investigations and reporting separately in another document, and making proper arrangements for the aftermath, it is appropriate to first report the severity of the disaster for your review. (County Magistrate of Zhenhai County, Xu Yong, bows his head and reports, with seal)</p>

<p>A Major Gunfight with Thieves Near Shiliupu Yesterday</p>
<p>A Thief Carried Two Guns, Planning to Go to Another Port</p>
<p>He Was Spotted by a Policeman as Soon as He Arrived at the Wharf</p>
<p>He Opened Fire and Fled Along Several Roads</p>
<p>As a Result, He Was Captured, Injuring One Pedestrian and Two Others</p>
<h3>The Thief, Li Axin, Was Soon Escorted to the Central Bureau</h3>
<p>At about 5 p.m. yesterday, gunshots were suddenly heard in the area of Taiping Lane, Salt Wharf, Damatou Outer Road, and Yangjiadu Street around Shiliupu in the Nanshi area. A district chief, Gong, was seen leading a large number of uniformed police officers to pursue a notorious thief. When passers-by saw this, they scattered and fled. For a time, order on the roads was greatly disrupted. Upon hearing the news, the reporter rushed to the scene to investigate and learned that a notorious thief, carrying two handguns, had arrived at the Damatou and was planning to board the Kuanfeng Steamer when he was discovered by a policeman. When the policeman tried to arrest him, the thief turned around and fled, opening fire to resist arrest and injuring two pedestrians and one policeman. The thief's right leg was also shot by the police, but he still fled for his life until he was captured by the police on the outer road of Hengxing East Lane. The details of the investigation are recorded below,</p>
<h3>Wharf Inspection</h3>
<p>At about 5 p.m. yesterday, a man in his twenties, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers, walked to Pier No. 8 of Damatou in Nanshi, intending to board the Baofeng Steamer parked there. At that time, Zhang Yi and Li Xingwang, two policemen from the First District Police Department, were inspecting passengers there. When they saw that the man was sneaky and suspicious, they immediately ordered him to stop and tried to search him. Unexpectedly, the man turned around and ran away. The police realized that he was not a good person, so they also ran after him.</p>
<h3>Opening Fire in a Panic</h3>
<p>When the man ran from the pier to Damatou Outer Road, Yang Yousong, a policeman guarding the fifth post there, saw this and immediately stepped forward to block his way. Just as he was about to arrest him, the man, in a panic, took out a handgun from his side and fired a shot at Yang's chest. Yang dodged, and the bullet passed through his right sleeve, creating two holes. Fortunately, he was not injured. The man then took the opportunity to escape west from Damatou Street into Guomalu. At this time, the police also drew their guns and chased after him, firing frequently.</p>
<h3>Three Policemen Collaborate to Capture Him</h3>
<p>At that time, Lian Jingyun, Fang Xiwu, and Nie Shengling, patrolmen of the First District, happened to be passing by the area. When they saw the situation, they immediately joined the police officers Zhang Yi and others to chase after him, and each took out their revolvers and fired at the thief. The thief then fled north from Guomalu to the intersection of Yangjiadu Street, and then turned west into Yangjiadu Street. He fled while turning around and firing at the police. At the same time, Gong, the district chief of the First District, received a police report and immediately led more than a dozen armed patrolmen and policemen to encircle him.</p>
<h3>The Notorious Thief Shot</h3>
<p>The thief then fled north from Yangjiadu Street into Yangjiadu Hengjie, then east back to Guomalu, directly to Yanmatou Street, and turned north, fleeing to the entrance of Zengxiang Lane. District Chief Guan and others still tracked him down bravely. The thief then turned into Zengxiang Lane again and fled back to Outer Road. Zhu Runzhen, an inspector of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, happened to be passing by the area and joined the chase and fired at the thief. The thief then fled north along Outer Road to the entrance of Taiping Lane. At this time, his right leg had been shot by the police, but he still fled west into Taiping Lane.</p>
<h3>Firing the Second Shot</h3>
<p>Because the nine bullets in the chamber of the handgun he was holding had been fired, he took out a second handgun from his side and fired wildly at the policemen chasing behind him like a madman. However, District Chief Guan still led the police to work hard to chase forward and fired shots. Xu Fenggang, a policeman guarding the fourth post at the entrance of Taiping Lane, also joined the chase when he saw this. The thief then fled west from Taiping Lane into ... Road, ... to the Hengxing East... West entrance near the 16th shop on Dongmen Road. Jiao Dezeng, a policeman guarding the ninth post there, also followed the chase when he saw this. Unexpectedly, the thief turned around again and fled east into Hengxing East Lane, heading straight for Outer Road.</p>
<h3>Officer Zhang Injured</h3>
<p>At that time, Zhang Wanfa, a patrol officer of the district, happened to be passing by the Dong entrance of the lane. Suddenly, he saw the thief fleeing east from the west entrance of the lane. Officer Zhang immediately took out his handgun and guarded the east entrance of the lane. When the thief fled near him, just as he was about to step forward to intercept him, unexpectedly the thief fired a shot at Officer Zhang. Officer Zhang was unable to dodge and was shot in the left leg. The bullet came out on the spot, and fresh blood flowed out immediately. In that instant, the thief had crossed Officer Zhang and fled to Outer Road.</p>
<h3>Falling to the Ground and Captured</h3>
<p>However, the thief was exhausted from running away at this time, panting like an ox, and the bullet in his right leg had not come out, and he was in unbearable pain from excessive blood loss, so he fell to the ground after running a few steps. The injured policeman Zhang Wanfa also chased after him in pain. When the thief saw this, he struggled to jump up from the ground again and turned around, just as he was about to fire a second shot at Officer Zhang, but Officer Zhang, at this point, disregarded everything and bravely stepped forward and hugged the thief around the waist, and was able to capture the notorious thief.</p>
<h3>Confiscating Two Guns</h3>
<p>At the same time, District Chief... also arrived and confiscated two handguns from the thief's hands. One of them had already been emptied of bullets. After inspecting the other gun with live ammunition, only two of the nine bullets in the chamber were left. Because both the thief and police officer Zhang Wanfa had been injured, they were sent to the Nanshi Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross. Doctors Zhang Jianxiong and Huang Qixiang first applied medicine and bandaged Officer Zhang's wounds, and then Officer Zhang returned to the district for treatment. They then performed surgery to remove the bullet from the thief's right leg, applied medicine and bandaged the wound, and then the police escorted him back to the district office.</p>
<h3>Named Li Axin</h3>
<p>District Chief... then interrogated him in advance. According to his confession, his name is Li Axin, 26 years old, from Chongming. However, he refused to reveal the purpose of carrying two handguns. Only after repeated interrogation did he confess that he had been working in a factory in the Jing'an Temple area of ​​western Shanghai. Recently, Shi A'er, a colleague in the same factory, asked me to take the two handguns to Baozhen on the afternoon of the 19th (the day before yesterday), and gave me ten yuan to use as expenses. So I carried the handgun to the Damatou today, intending to board the... Feng Steamer to set off. However, Shi A'er first went to Baozhen to wait, and we would meet and do business together after I arrived. Unexpectedly, I was discovered by the police at the wharf, which led to my arrest, etc. Because the thief's marksmanship was proficient and he was extremely courageous, he must be a notorious thief with rich experience. He immediately ordered the preparation of a document to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Injure People</h3>
<p>When the police and others were chasing the thief, the thief opened fire to resist arrest along the way, and the police also opened fire. As a result, bullets flew across Damatou, Yangjiadu Street, Outer Road, Yanmatou, Guomalu, Zengxiang Lane, Taiping Lane, and Hengxing Lane. Pedestrians on the road were terrified and scattered, and order was disrupted for a time. Zhou Hongfan (27 years old), a blacksmith from Haimen, who lived in Yangshupu, was grazed on the right back by a stray bullet. Wu Yaoming, a worker at the China Industrial Rubber Shoe Factory on Liuma Road, also from Tongzhou, was shot in the right back by a stray bullet. The two men were sent to Nanshi Hospital by police car. Doctor Zhang Jianxiong and others applied medicine and bandaged Zhou's wound. Because the injury was very minor, he was discharged from the hospital and returned home. However, Wu Yaoming underwent surgery to remove the bullet from his right arm and was hospitalized for treatment. It is said that if there are no changes in his condition, there is no danger to his life.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Prohibits Banks from Offering Prize-Linked Savings</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that various banks in Shanghai have recently created special prize-linked savings and special preferential interest savings, etc. The Ministry of Finance believes that this method is of great importance and is not convenient to approve, so it specifically ordered all banks to stop handling it. Yesterday, two banks, so-and-so, received this order. It is said that the bank had not submitted a report to the ministry for record before it first offered special savings, and it should be suspended immediately, etc. It is heard that the bank and others have complied with the order and completed the closure.</p>

<h3>An Unscrupulous Mother Sells Her Young Daughter into Prostitution</h3>
<p>The Woman is Inconstant and Miserable</p>
<p>Unable to Endure the Pain, She Took the Opportunity to Escape</p>
<p>丨She Sued Her Pimp Mother to the Court on Criminal Charges丨</p>
<p>The woman Teng Aishi, registered in Jiaxing, is only seventeen years old, with a beautiful appearance and has received a general education. Because her mother died early, her father remarried An as his wife. However, since An came to the door, she treated Aishi as if she were not her own and often gave her the cold shoulder. Until March of last year, An falsely claimed to the woman that she was going out to find her father and was taken to Shanghai. However, she had bad intentions and secretly contacted Zhang Laosan, a local prostitute from Nanjing, who secretly set up a brothel in the west wing of No. 4 Defeng Lane, Beijing Road.</p>
<h3>Place of Prostitution</h3>
<p>At that time, the two parties reached an agreement to mortgage Aibao to Zhang Laosan for a term of three and a half years, amounting to a price of four hundred and fifty yuan. From then on, the woman fell into the fire pit, engaged in the flesh trade, and changed her name to Xuefang. Every time the sun set, Zhang sent someone to accompany her to various hotels to solicit customers for prostitution. Even during her menstrual period or when she was ill, she could not avoid it. If she disobeyed, she would be punished. The woman was young and weak, and suffered this torment, so she did not have many days to live. She contracted a hidden disease.</p>
<h3>Withered in Appearance</h3>
<p>Her spirit was exhausted, but under the pressure of lasciviousness, she had no strength to resist, so she could only sigh at her own thin life. Recently, due to the market downturn and the poor state of the prostitution business, Zhang was angry at her, whipped her severely, and cut off her food and drink. Teng could not bear the pain, so she had to take the opportunity to escape. However, because she was in a hurry to leave, she did not have time to take out a pair of gold and tin (weighing two ounces), two gold rings (weighing two mace and eight cents), two hundred and seventy-four yuan in silver, and fifteen cents in small change (given by customers) that were deposited with Zhang Laosan, and was not given when she asked for them. Teng then hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Zhang Laosan of intending to make a profit,</p>
<h3>Forcing a Good Woman into Prostitution</h3>
<p>The lawyer accused her of encroaching on silver dollars and ornaments, violating Article 256, Paragraph 1, and Article 258, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, of crimes against public morals, and of causing serious damage to her body and mind due to excessive forced sex by the defendant, requesting an order for compensation of three thousand yuan and the return of the encroached items. After receiving the complaint, the court, in the afternoon yesterday, sent Judge Liu Yugui to the Ninth Criminal Court for questioning. The defendant Zhang Laosan came to court with her attorney, Hua Maosheng. The plaintiff, Teng Xuefang, stated that she was born on October 14th of this year, seventeen years old. Last year, she was deceived by her stepmother to come to Shanghai to find her father, but unexpectedly she was sold for a price. She also recounted the above situation and said that the defendant was indeed running a brothel. Her husband's name is Zhang... Feng. At that time, in addition to me,</p>
<h3>There Are Still Two Prostitutes</h3>
<p>One named A Yuan, 23 years old, and the other named Gui'e, 17 years old, were forced to go to various hotels every night to solicit customers, and all the money they earned was taken away by Zhang. If they had no customers for one night, they would be beaten. All my gold jewelry and silver dollars were given by regular customers, and now they have been encroached upon by the defendant. She asked for an order for compensation, etc. The defendant stated that her husband was in the business of... Teng came to her as an adopted daughter on June 20th of last year, led by her stepmother. At that time, the woman's mother stated that she could not live because the woman's father had died, and I happened to have no children under my knees, so I paid four hundred and forty yuan to take her as my daughter, and later sent her to a school in the Eight Immortals Bridge to study, but the woman was quite frivolous and often went out to play privately and did not return all night, and I repeatedly advised her to no avail. On June 11th of this year, she left and never returned. I also did not know about the jewelry and silver dollars when she left. She resolutely denied it. After the lawyers on both sides debated, Judge Liu ruled that the case would be sentenced this afternoon, and the defendant paid a four-hundred-yuan reliable shop as bail.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Intimidation Was Very Deep: Demanding Banknotes from Eleven Banks</h3>
<p>丨As a Result, Detectives Secretly Deployed, and the Bandit Was Captured丨</p>
<p>Each Banknote Must Be Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>So That It Would Not Be Easy to Detect When Exchanging</p>
<p>Xia Juqing, a Ningbo native, opened the Juqing Western Clothing Store at 148 Seward Road. Recently, his business has been quite prosperous, which has attracted the attention of bandits. From the 13th to the 19th of this month, he wrote two letters of intimidation, demanding 550 yuan. The words in the letters were very intense. If he did not agree, he would take final measures. He also agreed to wrap the money in yellow paper and place it under the signboard in front of the door at 3 a.m. the day before yesterday. Someone would come to take it, etc. Judging from his intention, he was afraid that the banknotes would be marked with a secret mark, and it would be easy for people to detect them when exchanging them at a tobacco shop. The procedure was also very precise. After Xia received the letter, he sent a letter to the Huishan Patrol Room, ordering Detective Wang Tongbo and the Western Detective to rush to the address and wait nearby. On the one hand, Xia sent someone to wrap the yellow paper according to the letter, looking like 500 yuan, and placed it in the designated place. After a while, Wang Zhuzi, a Qingkou native, came staggering, picked up the paper bag and tried to escape. Wang Detective and others stepped forward and captured him, and took him to the patrol room along with the paper bag. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Wu Zehan interrogated him. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the patrol room, stated the case briefly, saying that the defendant denied writing the letters of intimidation. In order to clarify the case, he asked the defendant to write a letter for comparison of handwriting and requested a postponement. Then he presented the paper bag and letters for inspection. When questioned, the defendant stated that he was a porter at the wharf and knew nothing about the intimidation letter. At that time, he happened to be passing by the area and saw a paper bag, so he picked it up. Unexpectedly, he was captured by the detective, etc. After Judge Wu verified the confession, he ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing after clarification.</p>

<h3>Solicitation Methods</h3>
<p>All Chinese and foreign people in this city who wish to participate in this Hibiscus Competition may register with the office of the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road from October 1st. The registration content is divided into varieties, models, characteristics, value, exhibitor's name, occupation, nationality, etc. The registration period ends on October 31st. On the day before the conference, bring the entries to the meeting for display with the registration certificate, and take them back with the registration certificate after the meeting.</p>
<h3>Ticket Purchase and Fee Issues</h3>
<p>Shen Xiangrui, the director of the zoo, told a Shanghai reporter that singing bird competitions are highly valued in European and American countries and are held almost every month. The research on the breed of hibiscus is particularly detailed, and there are specialized books on the improvement of the breed and the breeding methods, all of which have detailed research. There are many hibiscus products in China, and there are many breeders, but unfortunately they do not have the right methods, which has led to the gradual degradation of the breed. The import of foreign hibiscus is increasing day by day. In order to promote it, this association has prepared this competition. It was originally planned not to purchase tickets and charge fees when the meeting was held, allowing anyone to visit, but because there is no wide enough venue, we had to charge a small ticket fee to show restrictions and maintain order. As for the selection of judges, it was decided to hire experts to serve as judges. Staff members and exhibitors of this association will not participate in order to show fairness.</p>
<h3>Statistics for Last Month's Visit</h3>
<p>The zoo had a total of 186,940 visitors in August, with children accounting for 30,718 and adults accounting for 156,222, averaging more than 7,000 people per day. In addition, the number of visitors to the zoo is the highest every day. If various groups come to the zoo, please inform the zoo in advance to give them appropriate time for thorough observation and easy reception. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<h3>Wu Daquan Lectures on the Issue of Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>At the Invitation of the Banking Association</p>
<p>Detailed Analysis of Its Contents and Elements</p>
<p>At 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Banking Association invited Wu Daquan, manager of the Y盐业 Bank, to lecture on the issue of the controlled economy in the auditorium of the Youth Association on Sichuan Road. More than 600 people attended the lecture, including male and female employees of various banks, and Mu Ouchu, Chen Binhe, etc. Xu Xinliu, general manager of Zhejiang Xingye Bank, presided over the meeting and introduced Wu. Wu then gave a lecture, analyzing the elements of the controlled economy and the different historical significance. The following are the main points:</p>
<h3>Economic Doctrine</h3>
<p>The term "controlled economy" has swept the world in recent years. At the time, European and American countries experienced overproduction and economic panic, while the Soviet Union's five-year plan progressed step by step. In contrast, the controlled economy was successively regarded as a good way to save the situation. Now, let's analyze its elements, which are roughly four: (1) Planning under a certain economic doctrine, such as communism in the Soviet Union, fascism in Italy, the content of the controlled economy varies greatly, and when implementing a statistical economy, one must first base it on the country's economic doctrine to engage in it, and never copy it. Some people think that because Russia's five-year plan was successful, the controlled economy is only applicable under communism, which is actually a mistake. The Soviet Union's communist revolution took place in 1917, while the controlled economy occurred in 1929, and there is no inseparable connection between them. (2) Planning under a certain purpose, such as national defense economy, all economic proposals are aimed at completing national defense. Others, such as war economy, increasing production, or, like the capitalist countries in Europe and the United States, seeking a balance between production and consumption, each has its own purpose in engaging in control.</p>
<h3>Controlling Power</h3>
<p>(3) What kind of power is used to control it during implementation, that is, the power of the controller must be able to make the whole country act in unison. For example, the Soviet Union only organizes a... committee to preside over it. In Italy, it must be stipulated that the majority of the members are composed of an equal number of representatives from labor and capital and a small number of independent professional intellectuals. If it is in the United Kingdom, it must be based on professional groups, in the United States, it must be authorized by Congress, and in Japan, it must be combined with the... Department and the Zaibatsu to exert its power. Returning to our country, because of the long-standing habit, we only use individual to control the economy, and we do not have the ability to control groups. The view of region has not been eliminated, and the strength of professional groups is also weak, and there are few who can make the group absolutely comply with its decisions. In terms of controlling power, it is still... measured.</p>
<h3>Economic Organization</h3>
<p>(4) Planning in a certain economic organization, the controlled economy must first be based on the original economic organization of the country. The countries of capitalism and communism are very different, that is, countries with overproduction and countries with backward production, industrial countries and agricultural countries, are all different. Because the controlled economy can give some influence to the original economic organization and make it change slightly, but it cannot be used to break the inherent economic organization. Breaking the economic organization and building a new organization is economic doctrine, not controlled economy.</p>
<h3>Three Elements</h3>
<p>The term "controlled economy," although originating around 1928-1929, has existed in practice since ancient times. Examples include Zhong Zhiqi in ancient China, Shang Yang governing Qin, and Wang Anshi's New Policies, all of which involved significant economic policies. Looking at other countries, there are even more examples. In modern history, during the European War, all countries from Russia in the east to the United States in the west implemented wartime economies, which were also forms of controlled economies. However, they are not entirely the same as the current concept of a controlled economy. The current controlled economy differs from those of the past in the following three elements: (1) It is systematic and planned, not fragmented; (2) It is not temporary but permanent; (3) It is not only passive but also active.</p>
<h3>Correcting the Translation</h3>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wu stated that the original name for "controlled economy" was "planned economy," implying a comprehensive economic plan that the entire nation should follow, distinguishing it from the anarchic state of production resulting from laissez-faire capitalism. It originally had no particularly profound meaning. However, after the Japanese translated it as "controlled economy," it often led to misunderstandings. As for China implementing a controlled economy, he personally supports it in theory under certain conditions, but he dare not speak rashly in practice. A controlled economy is entirely based on the needs of the situation. Therefore, its correctness and merits must be determined by whether the economic development plan is suitable for the environmental needs and capabilities.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Requesting Supervision of Three Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>American Assessor Approves Appointment of Supervisor</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," shareholders of the United Film Company, due to the fact that the capital stock had not been fully collected, and creditors had filed lawsuits one after another, in order to maintain the company's existing assets and protect the interests of investors and creditors, sued the American Assessor's Office, requesting the appointment of a supervisor to fully manage the company's Da Guangming, Guotai, Carlton, and other theaters. American Assessor Pander opened the hearing yesterday. First, Mr. Sa Jiade, representing the shareholders, stated that the company's authorized capital was three million taels, but only one million nine hundred eleven thousand and seven thousand taels had been collected so far. The outstanding debts already being litigated amounted to approximately five hundred three-five thousand taels, and those not yet litigated amounted to approximately five hundred thousand taels. However, the company's assets still amounted to one million two hundred thousand taels. If all the creditors' lawsuits were successful, the assets would be entirely forfeited, and the creditors might not even be able to recover the full amount. Currently, Da Guangming has a monthly surplus of twenty thousand to twenty-five thousand taels, Carlton earns five thousand taels, and Guotai can also generate ten thousand taels in profit. Therefore, he requested the court to appoint a supervisor to maintain operations. Subsequently, regarding the issue of the supervisor's candidate, Sa Jiade nominated Peter, while lawyer Harington, representing some creditors, nominated Bain. However, Sa Jiade objected because Bain worked for the same company as Mark, and Mark had guaranteed the underwriting of all the shares, with more than one million taels still outstanding. Mark promised to pay it off by the end of this year. If this amount can be paid off soon, the company will not have financial difficulties. Finally, Assessor Pander approved the appointment of a supervisor. The matter of the candidate was temporarily reserved, and Assessor Pander will make a decision later.</p>
<h3>Designs for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships</h3>
<p>Already Drafted, Will Be Submitted to Specialists for Review</p>
<p>The designs for the three riverboats and four seagoing vessels planned by the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have been drafted. They were submitted to the board of directors meeting held yesterday for approval, and will be further reviewed in detail before being put out to tender for construction. The dimensions of the designs, as learned, are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Drafting the Designs</h3>
<p>After the contract for the 400,000-pound loan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee was signed, the Ministry of Communications dispatched shipbuilding expert Wu Daming to the company to draft the designs together with the company's technicians. The designs for the seagoing vessels were completed in the middle of last month, and the designs for the riverboats were only finalized yesterday. Both were submitted to the board of directors for study and will then be sent to experts for thorough review.</p>
<h3>Dimensions of Each Vessel</h3>
<p>The dimensions of the seagoing vessels are as follows: ship length 343 feet, upper deck length 325 feet, ship width 45 feet, draft 24 feet 6 inches. The passenger and cargo capacity is 2,000 tons at a draft of 14 feet and 3,400 tons at a draft of 17 feet 6 inches. The speed is 13 miles per hour, and the cost per vessel is approximately 1.5 million yuan. The dimensions of the riverboats are as follows: ship length 312 feet, upper deck length 300 feet, width 48 feet, draft 11 feet 6 inches. The passenger and cargo capacity is 1,900 to 2,000 tons, the speed is 12 miles per hour, and the cost per vessel is approximately 700,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chartering Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the company, in order to expand its business, the company plans to lease the warships Jing Shou and Ke An from the Ministry of the Navy to operate on the North and South Ocean routes. He had already discussed this with Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan when he visited Shanghai recently. The warship Jing An could not be leased because it was needed for its own use. The warship Ke An could not be agreed upon because the rental price was too high. He will discuss it further.</p>
<h3>New Manager of the Bank of China Began His Duties Yesterday</h3>
<p>Many Leaders from the Financial and Industrial Sectors Came to Offer Congratulations</p>
<p>The board of directors of the Bank of China previously resolved to appoint Mr. Yu Zuoting as the director of the business bureau and Mr. Zhu Zikui as the manager of the Shanghai branch. Both Mr. Yu and Mr. Zhu officially took office at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Mr. Yu is a leader in the money industry, and Mr. Zhu is also a prominent figure in the financial world. All the members of the Shanghai money industry, as well as leaders from the financial and industrial sectors, including Qin Runqing, Xie Taofu, Sheng Xiaoshan, and others, numbering no less than several hundred, came to offer congratulations. They were warmly received by Chairman Fu Xiao'an, directors Xu Shengchan, Li Shuxiong, and Mr. Yu and Mr. Zhu. The traffic was heavy, making it a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Regulations for the Management of Towboats and Barges Postponed for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating that the Ministry of Finance had previously consulted on the matter of the implementation date for the management of towboats and barges. The Ministry of Finance had stated in its consultation that the regulations were promulgated on June 5 of this year and would take effect immediately, and that the Customs Administration had been ordered to inform the Inspector General of Customs. Now, the Inspector General of Customs has telegraphed that he should follow the order. However, it has been found that there are quite a few towboats and barges that have not yet obtained licenses. If these regulations are suddenly enforced, and customs clearance is denied to those without licenses, it is bound to cause many vessels to stop sailing, which is deeply feared to lead to disputes, and will be detrimental to commercial transport and tax revenue. It seems appropriate to postpone it for three months to facilitate implementation. Is this feasible? The Ministry of Finance is hereby consulted for instructions so that it can be followed. After investigation, the postponement of the implementation of the regulations for the management of towboats and barges proposed by the Inspector General of Customs is for the purpose of facilitating implementation and can be followed. In addition to consulting and ordering separately, it is hereby ordered for your information.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Transportation Offices Encourage Merchants to Use Delivery Orders</h3>
<p>The two railway transportation offices issued a circular yesterday, stating that delivery orders are valuable securities, and their nature is of equal value to spot goods and can be used for pledges or sales. However, since the railway began issuing delivery orders, merchants have continued to use freight receipts to handle foreign exchange settlements, indicating that merchants do not have a deep understanding of the benefits of using delivery orders. Furthermore, it is not that the railway staff has not made every effort to promote it to merchants. It is hereby notified again that when merchants entrust the transportation of goods and fill out the consignment note, they should make every effort to explain the benefits of using delivery orders, and the procedures should also be simplified as much as possible so that merchants do not see it as a daunting task, in order to promote it to the fullest extent. All freight inspectors should make efforts to publicize it to merchants and go to each station to guide each staff member to handle it properly so that the merchants' reluctance to use delivery orders is gradually corrected, in order to assist the Ministry's intention to promote freight transport. All are required to comply.</p>

<h3>Ma Hongkui Telegraphed Request for Disaster Relief for Floods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Renji Hall yesterday received a telegram from Ma Hongkui, chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government, stating that since the beginning of summer, rivers and canals in the province have been plagued by floods, and there are many disaster victims, requesting prompt relief. The original telegram reads: (Omitted titles) Ningxia has suffered disasters over the years, and harvests have been poor. People have been displaced and have not had a peaceful life. This year's disasters in various counties are particularly severe. Since the beginning of summer, rivers and canals have been flooded. In Zhongwei and Jinji counties, fields have been completely submerged and houses have been turned into ruins. The affected residents number hundreds of thousands. Cries of sorrow can be heard everywhere, awaiting rescue. Ningxia Province's finances were already extremely depleted, and this major disaster has made them even more desolate. It is hoped that all benevolent people will make a call to action and spread benevolence together. The benevolent reputation and benefits will not only be enjoyed by the millions of disaster victims. The telegram is urgent and awaits a response. All relief funds should be sent to Dun Tai Yong Bank in Tianjin for collection. Brother Ma Hongkui.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Society Reports on the Severity of Floods in Shanxi</h3>
<p>Association Allocates 10,000 Yuan to Distribute Relief to Disaster Areas in Shanxi and Henan</p>
<p>Many people know about the severity of the Yellow River floods in Shandong and Henan, but the situation in the disaster-stricken counties of Shanxi is largely unknown due to blocked communication. The Shanghai Office of the World Red Cross Society yesterday received a telegram from the Red Cross Society, describing the extent and severity of the disaster in various disaster areas of the province, which is unbearable to witness. The World Red Cross Society Southeast Main Association Shanghai Office, has received a telegram from the Taiyuan Association which states: Shanxi Province suffered from floods last year, and has not recovered yet. The disaster this autumn is even worse. The counties along the Fen River and Taihang Mountain have all become flooded areas. Houses have been washed away. Millions of people will either die from drowning or from illness and injury. The most tragic areas include Qixian, Taigu, Wenshui, Taiyuan, Fenyang, Pingyao, Jincheng, Hongdong, Wuxiang, Linjin, Ronghe, Wuzhai, Jingle, Jiexiu, Yingxian, Xinzhou, and Daixian. Most of the disaster victims currently trapped in the water have become ill. The situation is too miserable to bear witness. If immediate relief is not provided, they will all freeze and starve to death. The county associations have already allocated funds and dispatched personnel to the worst-hit areas to handle emergency relief. The cup of water cannot extinguish a cartload of burning firewood. It is hoped that we will offer utmost assistance to save this calamity. After receiving the telegram, this office immediately remitted 4,000 yuan to the Taiyuan Association to continue emergency relief distribution. However, the various charities in Shanghai do not know the true extent of the river flood disaster in Shanxi, so this telegram is sent to inform you, and it is hoped that you will send a letter to all sectors, so that they will all know that the river flood disaster in Shanxi is no less than that in Shandong and Henan. Furthermore, regarding the emergency relief for Hua County in Henan, Yu Huidu had already been dispatched to carry 4,000 yuan to handle it. Now, due to the severity of the disaster in Dongming and Changyuan counties, which is no less than that in Hua County, 4,000 yuan has been allocated and remitted to Captain Yu Yuanfu to rush to distribute it.</p>
<h3>Li Yunmen, Relief Worker from Heze, Western Shandong, Departs</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society, the Shanghai Yellow River Flood Emergency Relief Joint Association, and the Nine Benevolent Associations jointly sponsored the Yellow River breach flood disaster in Heze County, Western Shandong. Director Li Yunmen, along with the relief workers, departed yesterday. The disaster situation in the county is very severe and relief funds are in great demand. How can philanthropists be able to independently manage one county or each manage one county in the disaster-stricken counties of Western Shandong, in order to save more lives and reduce the disaster? How can a large number of charitable compatriots be willing to give up their clothes and food to save people in danger, and jointly achieve this immeasurable merit?</p>
<h3>City Party Department Announces Deadline for National Salvation Groups to Submit Donation Account Statements for Inspection</h3>
<p>Announcement No. 92 of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party states: Regarding the announcement, according to the report from the Shanghai All Sectors Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations, please order all national salvation donation organizations to submit account statements and documents to the committee within a time limit for review. The Northeast is occupied, and people are paying the price. Brave soldiers are fighting at the forefront, and the people are providing support from behind. As a result, donation organizations have emerged in response, and donations have been flowing in continuously. Regardless of whether they are mentally or financially dedicated, they are serving the country, and their fervent hearts are deeply admired. Now that the war has ended, the fundraising organizations should announce the donors and recipients in detail to show great faith. Now that all sectors have an investigative committee, all organizations that have raised donations should send their account statements and documents for review to show great faith. Otherwise, it is inevitable that the public will have doubts, which will affect future donation sources. Therefore, it is specially announced that all national salvation organizations, whether they have ended or not, should send the account statements and documents of the national salvation donations raised to the Shanghai All Sectors Investigation Committee for National Salvation Donations for review within one week to dispel doubts and maintain credibility. This is most important and therefore announced.</p>

We are eager to present you with an excerpt of the resolutions that should be handled. We hope you will comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Financial Community in Beiping Requests Consolidation of the 8% '96 Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The holders of the 8% '96 Public Bonds in Shanghai previously requested the Ministry of Finance to consolidate them, but there was no response. It is found that the number of these bonds is greater in North China than in the South. It is now known that the bondholders in Beiping, together with the financial community, have jointly requested the central government through former financial officials to consolidate these '96 bonds as soon as possible. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to wait for a comprehensive plan to be formulated before attempting to consolidate them, and is currently planning it.</p>

<h3>First-Class Passenger Tickets on the Songhu Line Continue to Be Reduced in Price</h3>
<p>Ordered by the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau previously reported from the Traffic Department that, according to statistics from the past few months, third-class passengers on the Songhu branch line often account for more than 98% or 99%, while first-class passengers account for less than 1%. This is due to the high price of first-class tickets and the short distance. It was proposed to reduce the price of first-class tickets by one-third to attract more passengers. After submitting it to the Ministry of Railways, Order No. 1258 of the Ministry of Railways approved a trial period of three months. The Traffic Department was ordered to implement it from May 1 of this year. After the price reduction, the number of passengers increased and the revenue was more generous.

<h3>Where Did the Sex Saint Go?</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Zhang Jingsheng's self-proclaimed title of "Sex Saint" caused a huge uproar. Lin Yizhong, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, telegraphed the newly appointed magistrate of Raoping County, Lu Guifang, ordering him to arrest Zhang and bring him to the provincial capital for punishment. Rumors spread rapidly, with some saying that Zhang had already been detained by the Raoping County magistrate. Others said that Zhang had left Raoping and gone to Shantou, where he was detained by the mayor and would soon be sent to the provincial capital for severe punishment. There were even nervous and exaggerated tales claiming that Zhang had met with misfortune and that his attempt to become a Sex Saint had cost him his life.</p>
<p>Would a saint be detained by someone? Would a saint die an unnatural death? I don't think the above information is quite accurate. If a saint were to die an unnatural death due to detention, then could he not invent a fourth type of water after inventing the third, and wouldn't sexual studies be lost? I believe that Zhang Jingsheng, who calls himself a Sex Saint, must have the ability to turn misfortune into good fortune and transform calamity into auspiciousness. (Heaven has endowed me with virtue, what can the people of Raoping do to me?) Zhang Jingsheng can probably boast about that.</p>
<p>Indeed, the news of his detention by the county magistrate in Raoping was untrue, and the news of his detention by the mayor in Shantou was also untrue. There is a telegram from County Magistrate Lu as proof: (To all public security bureaus and district offices: Zhang Jingsheng, the industrial supervisor of this county, was ordered by telegram from the Department of Civil Affairs to be investigated, arrested, and sent to the provincial capital for investigation and handling. I immediately ordered a squad leader to arrest him, but he has not been found. He should be wanted and brought to justice so that he can be transferred. Please comply with the order, cooperate in the arrest, and ensure that he is brought to justice without any negligence. Signed, County Magistrate Lu, Yang.) So, even though the wanted notice is urgent, the Sex Saint, like the Monkey King, has probably flipped away on a somersault cloud, not knowing where he has gone. Maybe he has flipped into the Land of Women to experiment with them in sexual studies.</p>
<p>Recently, someone has been trying to overturn the charges against Zhang Jingsheng, arguing that the Raoping Residents Improvement Society in Shantou, which accused Zhang of ten major crimes, is an unregistered society, which constitutes an illegal organization. All accusations are akin to anonymous posters and should not be valid. After Zhang took office as the industrial supervisor of Raoping, he built over seventy miles of the Raoping-Qian Highway, which has had considerable success. It should be requested that the arrest warrant for Zhang be withdrawn and that he be reinstated as industrial supervisor. Alas! The saint will not die, sexual studies will be revived, and the Raoping Residents Society in Shantou, which accused the saint, will probably be punished under the principle of holding them accountable for (Non-saints cannot be law-abiding).</p>
<h3>Xu Leqing's Heroic Words Before Death</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the more bustling a city is, the more developed the things like adultery, theft, and robbery. Take Shanghai as an example, although it is said to be (The Paris of the East), its bandits are rampant, no less than New York in the United States. We poor people have no choice but to come to the city to make money because the countryside has gone bankrupt. It is strange that a group of wealthy people are in love with this (Paris of the East) and are unwilling to go to the countryside to enjoy the natural scenery of Mao Dian in Banqiao. They are willing to live in the land of thorns and thistles. This is really a strange thing!</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Xu Jun Leqing of my hometown was kidnapped on Haige Road and died of gunshot wounds while resisting. Outsiders do not know Mr. Xu's personality, and many records are inaccurate. Below I will briefly describe Mr. Xu's life with an objective eye. Perhaps Mr. Xu will rest in peace. Mr. Xu started his career in the yarn industry. He was meticulous in nature, rarely smiled, had rather new ideas, and was sincere in his words. He was particularly enthusiastic about education. There are two elementary schools for the poor in my hometown, called Pudi, which cost no less than 10,000 yuan. And in peacetime, when talking, it seemed that he still had the ambition to run a school: so it is really a wrong to say that he is mean. But he seemed unwilling to help individuals. He believed that a person should always strive for his own advancement, and that relief would only undermine his ambition and foster laziness, which is very much in line with (The Film Tower), written by the British novelist Conan Doyle. But over the years, there were also many people who relied on him for food; so his nature cannot be said to be mean.</p>
<p>This time, when he was kidnapped by bandits, he dared to resist them with the purse in his hand; wouldn't other wealthy people have already become honored guests in the bandit's den? After the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road took the bullet out of his abdomen, he was very clear-headed, spoke loudly, and often wanted to talk to people, saying: (The rampant actions of bandits are poisoning the society, all because they kidnap people and then redeem them. Try to see why bandits have disappeared in Japan, and you can understand. That's why I'd rather resist him than be kidnapped by him.) His family advised him to speak less, and the doctor had instructed him to do so. He smiled and said: (Death is another matter, what's the worry about the four rotten skins.) From this, his nature and thoughts can be roughly known.</p>
<p>To get back to the point, the ancients said: (Hiding things improperly teaches thieves.) They also said: (Elephants are burned because of their tusks.) Meng Zhuang used the fact that the worthless trees are not cut down by carpenters to compare the way of (Protecting oneself wisely). The average rich person can also understand!</p>
<h3>Two Hundred Thousand Women</h3>
<p>— Shen Xin</p>
<p>Recently, a friend who works in Western medicine told me that there are 200,000 women selling their bodies in Shanghai, divided into Changsan, Yaoer, wild chicken, and private prostitutes. Now, let's not think that this number is symbolic. Let's first talk about these 200,000 women. First, it can be said that 199,999 are carrying germs, because the source of the germs is not congenital, but from unclean intercourse or carelessness. However, a woman who has become a prostitute cannot pay attention to cleanliness, nor can she pay attention to being careful, so every woman is bound to carry some germs.</p>
<p>Second, with these 200,000 women who have been infected, on average, each woman can receive five men, so it can be argued that they can transmit germs to five men, which means that one million men are harmed, and their skin contains toxins. Then, these one million men will pass it on to each of their wives. Then, another one million women will be infected with germs; in this way, there are 2.2 million men and women who carry germs.</p>
<p>Just from these two topics, Shanghai will have 2.2 million men and women who are actually infected. Thinking further, statistics show that a quarter of the men and women in China are carrying germs. If this goes on year after year, with men passing it on to women year after year, women passing it on to men, and old people passing it on to young people, it will easily become a country of venereal diseases in the future.</p>
<p>But turning back, 200,000 women are also helplessly degenerate. However, our government should take some responsibility for how to deal with these 200,000 women, how to get them to break away from the germs, and how to provide relief. Don't let China in 1950 become a country of venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Hometown, determined to grow old in this village.</p>
<p>The imprisonment of the former type of prison is limited, and one has to work hard to overthrow it under one's own awareness; the imprisonment of the latter type of prison is not only at the end, but will always fascinate the girls, and they will never realize it until death. Therefore, even if the imprisonment of the former type of prison is overthrown by hard work, it is not necessarily gratifying; it is only when the latter type of prison is entered successively and voluntarily imprisoned for a long time that it is felt to be very sad! However, back to the point, the psychology of the girls is to overthrow the prison-like life after all, not to mention that there are admirable determination and perseverance; the reason why they enter another prison and are fascinated forever is really because the construction of another prison is competing and expanding, gradually invading the girls' inherent foothold to the point where they cannot turn around, and it is also very tempting and anesthetizing. How can the girls not fall into the prison door unconsciously in this environment? And be imprisoned for a long time!</p>
<p>Therefore, what we should pay attention to is not why the girls fall into the prison door, but how do the girls fall into the prison door?</p>
<p>Science Corner</p>
<h3>Maidens' Prison</h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>Freedom, liberation, women's league, women's rights, these are the songs that maidens are singing with continuous efforts; the things they are striving for. Undoubtedly, maidens want to fight for freedom and liberation because they have at least felt the pain of unfreedom and constraint; they want to expand the women's movement and improve women's rights because they at least feel the decline and fall of women's power and status. This is good, like a wrongful case suddenly happening, and people who are imprisoned for no reason often think about redressing the grievances, clearing their names, or shouting loudly, or simply planning how to achieve the goal of breaking out of prison.</p>
<p>It can be seen that wanting to escape and recover from imprisonment is a constant human feeling, just as wanting freedom and liberation from the pain of unfreedom and constraint, and wanting to expand the women's movement and improve women's rights from the decline and fall of women's power and status, can generally gain sympathy.</p>
<p>However, the facts tell us that there is a huge contradiction. On the one hand, maidens are working hard to overthrow this prison-like life, but on the other hand, they are running, hiding, and burrowing collectively towards another prison. Once they have run, hidden, and burrowed in, let alone voluntarily withdrawing forever, even if someone specially guides them not to take the path to light, they will resolutely reject it. They wear bright prison clothes all day long, eat rich prison food, rush to do prison work of laughing, jumping, singing, and feasting, and spend prison years of loving, marrying, divorcing, and suing. In short, they have already recognized this as happiness.</p>
<h3>Northeast Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Guest Leaves with Bashful Tenderness and Smiling Affection, Visitor Arrives with Old Grudges and Sadness Ensues</p>
<p>However, this visit was not specifically to inquire about Gui Zhi's news. It was only because Company Commander Zhao had visited the guildhall and introduced himself to teach at Dahongmen. Although the money was not much, earning money with his skills was a bright and pleasant thing. Since getting this position, he had been working hard all day and had not come to thank Zhao Ziqiang, which was wrong. Therefore, the biggest goal of this trip to Haidian was to thank Zhao Ziqiang. He hurried over, heading straight for the Xiyuan Barracks, without giving it much thought. It was not until he saw the building that he suddenly realized his mistake. He thought to himself that this trip was inevitably wrong. He didn't know which regiment or battalion he belonged to. How could he find a Company Commander Zhao Ziqiang in such a large place? If he went back to Haidian to thank his old father, it would be the same. However, his family lived in the same gate as the Yang family. He was unwilling to have to read the Yang family's faces. After thinking it over, based on his experience of living in Haidian for some time, he knew that there were two restaurants not far from Xiyuan, which were often frequented by junior officers. He was hungry, so why not go to one and have something to eat and inquire about Zhao Ziqiang's news? Perhaps he could find out. Thinking like this, he walked slowly. It was already April, and the shops had removed the window sills and lattice fans, so you could see the scattered seats inside from the outside. Before Ji Zhi even entered the door, a waiter wiping the table inside had already greeted him with a smile and a nod: "Second Master Gan, long time no see! Where have you been making a fortune?" Ji Zhi smiled and walked in, saying, "You still recognize me." The waiter said, "To the private room, please?" (193)</p>
<h3>Hurricane Wedding</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>(Hurricane), a term also called (Ju Feng, as the book "Nan Yue Zhi" says, a hurricane) has winds from all four directions. It often occurs in the fifth and sixth months. "Tou Huang Za Lu" says ("All the counties in Lingnan have hurricanes, because the wind comes from all four sides.") In the past, people sometimes called it (Typhoon), because this wind is most common in Taiwan, so Westerners call it (Typhoon), which is probably a transliteration of (Typhoon), it may be unknown: In short, this kind of wind is fierce and terrifying, not only in the ocean. When giant ships encounter it, they will be destroyed and their masts broken, but on land, it will also uproot large trees and collapse huge buildings. The harm it can cause is tens of thousands of times stronger than other forces like water and fire!</p>
<p>The direction of the (hurricane) is truly strange. It does not follow a straight path, but instead revolves in the sky at various sizes, from all four sides. Therefore, this center is called the (center of the circle) by astronomers, because when the (hurricane) in the northern hemisphere of the equator gathers at the center, there is a ratio, like the hands on a clock face, moving in reverse. What is the reason for this? Its progress is from south to east, to north, to west, and to south. Is this not a clear example? The first (hurricane) arrived in Shanghai not long ago, but unexpectedly, the second one came again, and gave it a title of (newlywed joy). A certain newspaper said that a hurricane moving near the eastern part of Wenzhou was only two hundred and fifty miles away from the hurricane found on the southern sea of ​​Taiwan on the morning of the eighteenth. The two winds may reunite and hold a wedding ceremony somewhere, it may also be unknown. This kind of speculation and argument is indeed an excellent writing style for recording events. It transforms the alarming scene into the most charming and sensual material of awaiting mandarin ducks. It is indeed a groundbreaking and brand-new topic since the recording of (wind positions), which is enough to make people pay great attention!</p>
<p>However, many terms for wind are also recorded in our ancient books. The Book of Changes says, "(Nothing is faster than wind in agitating all things)," which is also an example of (hurricane). The Book of Documents records, "(When he entered the Great Forest, the violent wind and thunder and rain did not confuse him,)" and the Spring and Autumn Annals has the event of "(six yis flying backwards, passing the capital of Song, it was the wind)." These are all authorities of the wind, so they are recorded in detail. However, the wind itself has never been analyzed. "Wind Soil Records" says, "(In June, there is a long southeast wind, commonly known as 'Oriole Wind')," but it is named because the fish in the sea turn into orioles, and the gender of the orioles is not explicitly mentioned. Also, according to "Tu Jing," there is "(the danger of the sea route, called (Gale), (Black Wind), Idiot Wind), which rages for days without stopping, and the four directions cannot be distinguished. When the black wind rises, the heaven and earth are dark, and day and night cannot be distinguished.)" But it only talks about the impropriety of the wind and the confusion of the wind, and never mentions the love of the wind. Even the two words (male wind) are only used to describe the momentary exhalation of the king, and not that the wind is truly a husband. If the wind really has a male, why can't a (female wind) be found to be its spouse?</p>
<p>Now, then there is a ready-made precedent. Whenever (a hurricane passes through the territory, everyone can understand where this (wind god) is getting married, and is coming to Shanghai to spend his honeymoon. Unfortunately, after our January 28th Incident, followed by a year of famine, the autumn floods are coming, and it is still unpredictable whether the tide players will not do evil. But first, the two of you have descended hand in hand twice, as if hearing the rattling sound of drums and music laughing and saying in the sky "(My love)?" I don't know that the earth is collapsing walls and houses, and the crops and trees are being uprooted, and in the blink of an eye, everything will be washed away, and the voices of crying and lamenting can be faintly heard in this wind!</p>

<h3>Shanghai City Games</h3>
<p>First Day of Track and Field: Women's Pentathlon Breaks National Records in Shot Put, Javelin, 100m, and 200m Hurdles. Qian Hangsu Uniquely Dominates Three Events and Shows Her Skills.</p>
<p>Southeast Wins Women's Softball Championship</p>
<p>Baseball Starts Today, Soccer, Men's and Women's Basketball All in Quarterfinals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Third City Games Men's and Women's Track and Field Competitions started yesterday afternoon. As a result of the first day's competition, the women's national records were broken in as many as five events, including the shot put, javelin, 100m, 200m, and hurdles. The men's 400m hurdles tied the national record, adding a lot of color to the Games. The competition will continue from 2 pm today. Track and field will end today, and the decathlon will begin. It is expected that new records will continue to be produced. Yesterday morning, as a result of the women's softball final, Southeast won over East Asia ten to eight, winning the championship. Baseball starts today with John vs. Jiaotong, and Donghua easily advanced to the soccer quarterfinals. There are many men's and women's tennis matches. There are also three men's and women's basketball games in the evening. Martial arts also began to compete. The track and field competition results are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue The venue is at the track and field stadium on Labor Father Road. The party and national flags are flying at the entrance, with a white banner high above that says "Shanghai Third City Games." The command post is located at the west end of the stadium. A couplet is hung in front of the stage: "(Heaven operates vigorously, and the talents of Shanghai gather together to exercise. Our military power is mighty, and we revive the spirit of the Chinese nation.)" On the stage, the prizes are dazzling. A portrait of the Premier and the party and national flags are hung in the center. The Municipal Public Security Bureau specially sent a military band to the venue to play music. Next to the command post, the Municipal Health Bureau set up a first aid team tent and sent six doctors and nurses to the venue to provide first aid. Order was maintained by the East Asia Boy Scouts.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 2 pm. First, all the athletes circled the stadium once, followed by Mayor Wu's opening speech, which briefly stated that today is the Shanghai Third City Games. Sports have great significance in China. The country has thousands of years of history, 400 million people, and one-twelfth of the world's land. Since the eastward spread of European customs, the national status has been declining for more than a hundred years. The reason for this is that when our country was closed to the outside world, European civilization had surpassed China, and Chinese culture could not create and at the same time lost its ability to be confident, so it could not be compared with others. The Premier instructed us to implement nationalism and revive the Chinese nation, to resist the oppression of foreign nations in a passive way, and to strive for physical and mental exercise in an active way, so that the Chinese nation can be revived and strong. A nation must have a common belief, and this belief is the central idea of ​​the entire nation. This is the exercise of the mind. As for the exercise of the body, it is to train the body and create healthy citizens to shoulder the important responsibilities of the country. If the people of the whole country can understand this meaning and work hard to do it, it will not be difficult for the Chinese nation to revive. Sports are a very common thing in Europe, but in China, they have a very profound meaning. I hope that all athletes will understand this meaning, he said.</p>
<h3>Representative Speech</h3>
<p>Following Mayor Wu was Cai Hongtian, a representative from the Municipal Party Committee, who said briefly that talents will be selected from the Third City Games in the city to participate in the National Games. All athletes should show good results and win glory for the city in the future. But this is not the real purpose. The Games are not held for competition. Although there are prizes for the winners, this is only a memorial. The real meaning is that all athletes pay attention to their daily results and gradually seek improvement. Therefore, this Games should be compared with the past one or two sessions to test whether there is progress. I hope that all athletes will continue to work hard even when they are not in the Games, to strengthen their bodies and save the country, he said.</p>

<h3>Overview of Men's and Women's Track and Field</h3>
<p>Men's 100m Preliminaries The 100m preliminaries were divided into four groups, and only two players were selected from each group. Therefore, before the start, the players were all trembling and cautious. As a result, the famous players Chen Jiayou and Wang Jiya were not selected. The old general Hao Chunde has not been in good condition in recent years, and his results have been declining. Therefore, everyone has put him behind them. Unexpectedly, Huang Zhong, although old, still has the power of a hundred steps. In the second group of preliminaries, he achieved excellent results, tying with Cheng Jinguan with a record of thirteen seconds. Su Xiaoru is a rising star from Shandong. He is young and has a lot of potential.</p>
<h3>Five Women's National Records</h3>
<p>Shot Put, Javelin, 100m, 200m, Hurdles</p>
<p>| Men's 400m Hurdles Ties National Record |</p>
<p>On the first day of the Games yesterday, as many as five women's national track and field records were broken, and one men's record was tied. Among the five women's records, Ms. Qian Hangsu uniquely won three of them, which is extremely commendable. The new records are compared in the following table:</p>
<p>Event Result Creator National Record Holder</p>
<p>Women's 8lb Shot Put 9.82m Ma Ji 9.35m Ma Ji</p>

<p>High hopes, today will compete with Cheng and Hao for the 100m championship.</p>
<p>▲Men's 200m Preliminaries The 400m hurdles preliminaries were completed, and then the 200m preliminaries were held. Therefore, Cheng Jinguan shook his head and sighed incessantly. The preliminaries were originally divided into four groups, but unexpectedly, as many as thirteen people were absent during the roll call, so they were merged into two groups. Why does this kind of spirit always appear in the City Games? It is really incomprehensible. As a result of the preliminaries, Cheng Jinguan and Su Xiaoru won the championships in the two groups.</p>
<p>▲Men's 400m Preliminaries The famous Shanghai middle-distance runner Dong Shuzhao gave up the 400m preliminaries, conserving his energy and preparing to win the 1500m. Therefore, the players in the second group of preliminaries were all overjoyed, thinking that the departure of the strong enemy would increase the chances of being selected. Who knew that Li Yanxiang, a dark horse, would stand out with a special score of 53.5 seconds, overwhelming the old general Guan Changfa, which was really commendable. In today's finals, this man should fight to the death with Zeng Rongzhong.</p>
<p>▲High Hurdles Preliminaries High hurdles can be described as difficult in track and field, and it is most difficult to make progress. Therefore, for many years, the high hurdles in the Shanghai Games have been occupied by Cao Yu, Xiao Dinghua, Chen Ling, and Chen Jiayou in succession. No one has asked about it for a long time. This new talent is really difficult to produce. In yesterday's preliminaries, these four people still ranked among the best, and their results have not improved, which is still disappointing.</p>
<p>▲400m Hurdles Preliminaries The track and field track has only five lanes, so it is often difficult to record the rankings in the 400m hurdles preliminaries and semifinals. For example, if only six people participate, they must also be divided into two groups for the preliminaries. Since they are divided into two groups for the preliminaries, they cannot record the same rankings. Since there are difficulties, they feel inconvenient. I hope the association will find a way to remedy it and widen the track by one meter to avoid future difficulties. Yesterday's preliminaries were originally divided into three groups. Fortunately, only nine people arrived during the roll call and were divided into two groups for the preliminaries. Otherwise, it would have added a lot of trouble. As a result of the preliminaries, the results of the first group were mediocre. In the second group, Tao Yingjie tied his own national record of 60 seconds set at the Shanghai National Games in 1932. However, in today's finals, Tao has many strong opponents. Cheng Jinguan and Chen Ling both have the ambition to explore the championship. Therefore, the reporter believes that Tao's final today cannot be optimistic.</p>
<p>▲Women's 50m Preliminaries Chinese women's sports have indeed made a lot of progress compared to the past, but they still lack training. Watching the female athletes who participated in yesterday's track and field, except for a few female students who graduated from physical education schools, the rest lacked training. The hand posture, the angle of the feet, and the method of digging the starting hole are all illegal. The basic work is like this, and the technical training can be imagined. As a result of the three groups of preliminaries, Chen Shuqing's results were the best, and her posture was also excellent. This championship is probably none other than this gentleman. Although Li Shihui's pace is large, the movement of her hands should be improved, otherwise, there is no hope of reaching the peak. Xiao Jieying has a moderate build and is a good material for sprinting. She should work hard to practice.</p>
<p>▲Women's 100m Preliminaries In the dull preliminaries of each event, Miss Qian Hangsu broke the national record of 13.63 seconds held by Sun Guiyun for many years with a special score of 13.5 seconds, raising the eyebrows of our Shanghai women. However, this record needs to be further studied, because the starting command and timing are closely related.</p>
<p>▲Women's 200m Preliminaries The preliminaries were divided into two groups. Li Yinan in the second group had great ambition to win the championship. Therefore, before the start, she was very careful in preparing, and even the starting hole was dug by the male coach, which was extremely thoughtful. After the gun sounded, she competed with Qian Hangsu all the way, always being no more than two meters apart. As a result, Qian Hangsu set a national record of 29 seconds, surpassing Sun Guiyun's 29.2 seconds. Miss Li was still second.</p>

<p>▲Women's Hurdles Preliminaries One victory leads to all victories, becoming an unbreakable rule. Winning three times in a row has been passed down as a beautiful story since ancient times. Miss Qian Hangsu broke the national record in the 100m, set the national record in the 200m, and broke the national record in the hurdles again. It was really a double blessing, and her value tripled in an instant, making Sun Guiyun, who had been famous for a long time, fall in reputation. This is really one of the most memorable things in the arena yesterday. Discussing Miss Qian's posture of crossing the hurdles, she and Xiao Dinghua can be called equal. She is beautiful and unparalleled, and it is not an exaggeration to call her a female hero.</p>
<p>▲1500m Finals A total of nineteen people attended the start. Since the first turn, Dong Shuzhao has led the crowd until the end, and no one has been able to surpass him. However, the speed was too slow. The speed of the first lap should be one minute as the standard on weekdays, but yesterday it reached one minute and four seconds. No wonder he couldn't create an excellent record. Dong has a worst habit, that is, he often looks back in the fourth lap. Because looking back and forth during the race is easy to lose the average speed, easy to fall, and once you look back, the speed will definitely decrease. Even if the speed does not decrease, you should not look back, because looking back and forth has at least two expressions, one is that you are exhausted and afraid of being overtaken by the people behind you, and the other is that you have the victory in hand, and even if you look around, it is difficult for the people behind you to catch up. This kind of imitating slow air is really unbearable. I hope Dong will work hard to quit. Second, Dong Jiaxie has always followed Shuzhao yesterday, but his steps are light and seem to have improved compared to the past. His shortcoming is also that the first lap is too slow. Third, Hou Dechong has a great body of strength, but his steps are too small, and the tendons between his thighs are too tight. If he can pay attention to this point in the future, he will make even more progress.</p>

<h3>Men's and Women's Track and Field Quick Report</h3>
<p>▲Men's Discus Final</p>
<p>In the second throw, Gong Wanyu achieved a score of 35 meters precisely. In the fifth throw, Chen Baoqiu achieved 32.65 meters. This final was expected to be a contest between Chen and Gong. However, after Gong Wanyu broke the 35-meter mark in his second throw yesterday, Chen Baoqiu seemed to be falling behind, with each forceful throw only reaching around 32 meters. The third place was Luo Qian from Wusong Merchant Marine, with a score of 31.10 meters. It is said that this gentleman's usual score is around 33 or 34 meters, but he seemed unable to fully display his abilities yesterday. The fourth place was Wu Juxu from Dongya, the discus champion of this spring's city-wide high school joint sports meet. Looking at the posture of the top four, Gong Wanyu's was the best. Gong used the pure Saito style. Chen Baoqiu's turning technique had improved slightly compared to before. The scores of the top two both broke the meet record.</p>
<p>First Place: Gong Wanyu: 35 meters precisely (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Chen Baoqiu: 32.65 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Luo Qian: 31.10 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Wu Juxu: 30.23</p>
<p>▲Men's High Jump Final</p>
<p>Among yesterday's finals, the high jump was the worst in terms of performance. Due to the heavy rain a few days ago, the venue was still not dry yesterday, especially the jumping area for the high jump, which was muddy and soft. Fine sawdust was temporarily applied to cover it up. The scores of the athletes were greatly affected. As a result, five people cleared 1.67 meters: Gu Yu, Ling Zhaohong, Zhou Shizhao, Chen Tianhe, and Wu Jinqi. 　Two spaces increased, none of the five jumped over it. Wu Jinqi voluntarily gave up. Gu, Ling, Zhou, and Chen then attempted to jump one notch lower. Gu Yu soared over it in one leap, but the other three failed again. They lowered it again to jump again. Ling, Zhou, and Chen then jumped over it one after another, and the ranking was determined. However, the four people completed with the same score. If the venue had been perfect, the score would have been more than this. Here are the scores of each person:</p>
<p>First Place: Gu Yu: 1.67 meters</p>
<p>Second Place: Ling Zhaohong: 1.67 meters</p>
<p>Third Place: Zhou Shizhao: 1.67 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Chen Tianhe: 1.67 meters</p>
<p>▲Men's Long Jump Final</p>
<p>The long jump final was held in the dim evening light. Before the competition, Wang Jihuai and Wu Jinqi were the most highly anticipated, because Wang and Wu's scores in usual practice were mostly above 6.60 meters, even reaching 7 meters. Yesterday, Wu's long jump was also not good after the high jump, and his absence from the competition was a great disappointment to the audience. A total of eleven people participated in the competition, but only five jumped over 6 meters. Unexpectedly, Wang Jihuai ranked third with a score of 6.42 meters. Apart from the record of 6.42 meters in the first jump, Wang Jihuai often committed fouls in his subsequent jumps. Sun Huipei, who came in second, achieved 6.49 meters in the final jump, which was only an average score. Sun had previously jumped over 6.55 meters in the preliminary round of the National Games, and Wang had won the National Games with 6.705 meters. This regression is truly puzzling. The first place, Hao Chunde, was the long jump champion of the previous National Games (6.01 meters). In this competition, he achieved a score of 6.72 meters in the fifth jump, but unfortunately, it could not be counted as an official record because he stepped over the line. Hao's comeback is promising. Here are the final records of the top four:</p>
<p>First Place: Hao Chunde: 6.62 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Sun Huipei: 6.49 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Wang Jihuai: 6.42 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Gu Yu: 6.20</p>
<p>▲Women's Shot Put Final</p>
<p>Yesterday, only six people participated in the women's shot put final: Ma Ji (Zi Jun), Meng Jian, Ruan Huiyuan, Xu Wenying, Zhang Pingfu, and Zou Min. As a result, Ma, Meng, Ruan, and Xu were selected. Ma Ji achieved 9.82 meters in the first throw, breaking her own national record of 9.35 meters. She was unable to reach this score in each subsequent throw. Meng Jianli, who came in second, achieved 8.89 meters in the fifth throw, which was also an excellent score. Ruan Huiyuan and Xu Wenying, who came in third and fourth, had very close scores and also broke the previous meet record of 8.11 meters held by Han Wanzhang. Champion Ma Ji's score can be said to be unmatched in the country. In this National Games, the women's shot put champion will definitely be Ma. Since the Northeast Incident, Ma has been studying at Southeast Teachers College in Jiangwan, Shanghai. It is said that her usual score is always above 10 meters, but she was still unable to fully display her abilities this time. Here are the scores of the top four:</p>
<p>First Place: Ma Ji: 9.82 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Meng Jianju: 8.89 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Ruan Huiyuan: 8.68 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Xu Wenying: 8.46 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>▲Women's Javelin Final</p>
<p>The women's javelin final was one of the most outstanding events of yesterday's meet. The top two both broke the national record. The champion, Chen Rongming, achieved a score of 27.75 meters, exceeding the national record (24.205 meters held by Huang Shushen) by more than 3 meters, which is truly rare. Chen's steps, posture, and speed when throwing the javelin are all top-notch, but the last step before throwing is not smooth and skilled enough. If she can pay more attention to this, she may be able to break the 30-meter mark. The second place, Gan Hongying, achieved a score of 24.85 meters, also breaking the national record. The scores of the third and fourth places were also close to the national record. In the future National Games, Shanghai may have no opponents in the women's javelin event. Here are the scores of the top four:</p>
<p>First Place: Chen Rongming: 27.75 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Gan Hongying: 24.85 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Sun Zheng: 24.16 (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Chen Jucai: 23.58 (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>▲Women's High Jump Final</p>
<p>The number of participants in the women's high jump final was extremely enthusiastic, with many being eliminated around 1.15 meters. By the time of the final three attempts, the evening was already dim. The final selections were Zou Shande, Li Baohui, Wang Huachang, and Huang Peihang. The scores of the four were very close. In the end, Zou Shande of Southeast and Li Baohui of Dongya competed for first and second place. Zou cleared 1.28 meters in two jumps, while Li failed to clear it in three jumps, so she had to settle for second place. The third place was Wang Huachang of Dongya, and the fourth place was Huang Peihang of Southeast. The scores were all above 1.20 meters, but unfortunately, the scores of the second, third, and fourth places were not officially measured. Here are the rankings of the four:</p>
<p>First Place: Zou Shande: 1.28 meters (New Meet Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Li Baohui</p>
<p>Third Place: Wang Huachang</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Huang Peihang</p>

<h3>Southeast Wins Women's Softball Championship</h3>
<p>Defeated Dongya 10-8 Yesterday</p>
<p>The final of the City Games women's softball competition, Southeast versus Dongya, was held at the baseball field at 10 AM yesterday. The strength of the two teams was evenly matched. Dongya's players became flustered and made mistakes due to the shouts of students from outside the field, which backfired. They lost to Southeast 10-8, and the championship went to Southeast. In the top of the second inning, Southeast scored as many as six points due to the errors of Dongya's fielders, which was fatal.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Gains and Losses in the Second Inning</h3>
<p>Dongya started the attack but failed to score. Southeast took its turn at bat, and Ren Shu first returned to home base, scoring one point. In the second inning, Meng Jian (of Da Han) hit a high ball that went over the outfielders and reached base, then stole third base. Liu Zhimin hit a single, Meng returned home, and Liu also scored a point. Dongya then took the lead with 2-1. Southeast took its turn at bat, and their momentum was fierce. Every hit was successful, and all three bases were occupied. Sun Zheng and Qin Ruizhen scored one after another. Later, due to Dongya's fielding errors, Southeast's Pan Yueying, Xu Wenying, Ren Shu, and Zou Shande also returned to home base one after another, scoring as many as six points. Southeast took the lead with 7-2. Dongya's defeat was due to this.</p>
<h3>Attempting a Counterattack Was Too Late</h3>
<p>Neither team scored in the third inning. In the fourth inning, after one Dongya player was out, Southeast staged a double play, but the referee was flustered and could not distinguish the situation, so he only called one player out. Dongya then unfairly gained one point. The incident occurred at first base. Dongya had one person on base. The next batter hit a high foul ball, which was caught by the fielder. This batter should have been out, and at the same time, the person on first base stole second base (which is not allowed). The fielder then threw the ball to first base, and this runner should also have been out. Only the batter was called out. Each team scored one point in this inning. Dongya scored two points and Southeast scored none in the fifth inning. Dongya scored none and Southeast scored two points in the sixth inning. The total score was 10-5. Dongya decided to fight with its back to the wall and hoped to retaliate. They scored as many as three points in the seventh inning, but it was too late, and they were defeated. In the bottom half of the inning, Southeast did not need to play again because they had already won. Southeast then won the championship with 10-8. Dongya ○ 2 ○ 1 2 ○ 3 丨8 points Innings (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) A</p>

<h3>Special Feature on Two Female Heroes</h3>
<p>▲Ma Ji and Chen Rongming Miss Ma Ji is also known as Ma Zijun. She is from Liaoning Province. At first, she didn't know what sports were. After the September 18th Northeast Incident, she felt that she couldn't fight the enemy without training her body, so she resolutely started exercising. At that time, she was in Hongda Middle School in Beiping, but she didn't have good opportunities to practice every time. Last autumn, Miss Ma and a few other classmates transferred to Southeast Physical Education College in Shanghai and entered the third grade. So she got plenty of opportunities to develop her talent. This kind of indomitable practice really discovered her amazing shot put and discus talent, and at the same time created an amazing record of 10.50 meters in the shot put that she had never imagined. Yesterday, because the venue was not suitable, she only created a national record of 9.82 meters. Ah, Miss Ma gave us a special understanding, dark and healthy thighs, Miss Meng, Miss Ruan, and Miss Xu also broke the previous record.</p>
<p>Chen Rongming of Liangjiang is indeed a female hero. In the first throw, Miss Sun Jing of Southeast took the farthest record with great style. She was not afraid at all, and chased after her closely. In the last second time, she broke the national record with one shot. She is 18 years old this year and is in the fifth grade of Liangjiang. Last year, she was buried by White at the National Games, so she is now working hard. Her score is 27.75 meters.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team Wins the Final</h3>
<p>▲64 to 10 Victory over Xiaguang</p>
<p>As a result of yesterday's women's basketball semifinal, Liangjiang defeated Xiaguang and won the right to final, 64 to 10. Liangjiang was victorious from beginning to end, like a hot knife through butter. Xiaguang had no way to resist. From the time Chen Rongming made a free throw to open the record, Liangjiang entered the game one after another. The first quarter was 13 to 0. In the second quarter, Liu Mali made three free throws and Zhuang Lingzhao made one, scoring five points. The first half was 23 to 5. The situation remained the same in the second half, and the game ended with 64 to 10.</p>

<h3>Fifth District Wins Football Championship</h3>
<p>| Two Goals to One Against Second District |</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the final football match between the Second and Fifth Districts took place. After a fierce 90-minute battle, the Fifth District defeated the Second District by a score of 2-1, winning the championship. The referee was He Chunhui.</p>
<p>Before two minutes had passed, a Fifth District defender handled the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. Gu Biao, the Second District's center back, kicked the ball into the net. The Fifth District team, mostly composed of Shanghai County players, had come with a strong ambition to win the title. After conceding a goal, they increased their efforts, employing a Scottish-style formation. The five forwards and two midfielders attacked in a coordinated manner. The ball frequently revolved within the Second District's territory, creating numerous scoring opportunities, but all were missed. Shen Fugeng took two long-range shots, one going over the goal and the other bouncing back off the goalpost. The Second District survived these dangerous moments. The five Fifth District forwards coordinated their advance with exceptional activity. Once, a ball was kicked right in front of the Fifth District's goal, and the goalkeeper, after fumbling and falling, luckily acted quickly, tightly holding the ball in his arms and throwing it out of the goal to avert disaster. The first half ended with the Second District leading 1-0. In the second half, after switching sides, the Fifth District intensified their counterattack. The Second District's territory was filled with enemy riders, resembling a scene of turbulent waves. Shen Fugeng, the right forward for the Fifth District, shot fiercely at the goal from within the crowd. Li Cui was unable to stop it, and the net moved, causing the Fifth District supporters to cheer wildly. With the score now tied, both sides advanced and retreated repeatedly, putting on a remarkable display. Shortly after, the Fifth District was awarded another corner kick opportunity, sending the ball towards the Second District's goal. Center forward Gu Jingchu headed the ball into the net, reversing the score and achieving victory. However, unfortunate events began to occur from this point onwards. Both sides engaged in open and concealed fouls, with many instances of misconduct. Zhou Cheng of the Second District was sent off the field for kicking a player. In the final five minutes, the Fifth District took two shots at the goal, but Li Cui stopped both by diving to the ground. As a result, before the final whistle, the Fifth District won 2-1. The team lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>▲Fifth District</p>
<p>Tao Jianhua, Chen Xirong, Weng Kefa, Fang Xiangtao, Cao Wei, Zhou Chenping, Xue Zhongcai, Shen Fugeng, Gu Jingchu, Li Jianhou, Wu Jiugao</p>

<h3>Second District Wins Women's Volleyball Championship</h3>
<p>| Three Sets to One Against Third District |</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the women's volleyball final between the Second and Third Districts took place. The strengths of both sides were immense. One team comprised the elite from Zhenhua and Su Girls' Normal School, while the other consisted of the dominant forces from Xichang counties. The matches were filled with thrilling moments, and the audience's applause was incessant, rivaling the matches between Shanghai Wuben and Haixing.</p>
<p>Referee Wu Bangwei, positioned high on the judge's platform, issued commands. The Third District gained the right to serve, scoring seven consecutive points. Soon after, they switched sides with a score of 11-2. The Second District served, gradually catching up. Due to slight disarray in their formation, teammates yielded to each other, resulting in considerable point losses. The Third District reached 16-9 and then 20-10. Finally, Yang Luyi rose and completed the first game with a decisive hit, gaining many points. The front row's set-ups and the middle row's spikes were unique. The Third District was also not weak, but their luck was lacking. At 16-9, they resisted for a while but ultimately lost the first game with a score of 11-21.</p>
<p>After each side won a game, both became cautious. Each rally involved four or five exchanges, from 4-2 to 5-3, and then 10-10. The Second District finally switched sides at 11-10. The second half was even more exciting. Yang Luyi's spikes were top-notch, and Kang Lianjuan's blocks were also remarkable. The score remained level. At 18-18, the Second District scored several consecutive points, taking the lead 2-1.</p>
<p>After turning defeat into victory, the Second District's players' spirits soared, and their coordination improved. Despite the Third District's intensified resistance, it was ineffective. Soon after, they lost again with a score of 16-21. The final result was 3-1, with the Second District winning the championship.</p>

<h3>Men's Basketball Quarterfinals</h3>
<p>▲Seventh District Eliminates First District　The First and Seventh Districts played a basketball quarterfinal match yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. At the start, the First District showed its poor form again. After the Seventh District scored three baskets, Wu Taiguang scored two points. Wu's teammate Han Kewen also left the court for a rest, making the situation even more unfavorable. Chen and Jin, the forwards for the Seventh District, were hitting shot after shot. The First District, having scored only two points, did not score again until Wu scored another basket towards the end of the first half. Moments later, the First District seemed to wake up from its slumber. Little Han returned to the court to help, scoring several consecutive baskets and greatly boosting their momentum. The Seventh District had no choice but to call timeouts multiple times to curb their momentum, but all were ineffective. Fortunately, time was on their side. Just as the First District was working hard to recover lost ground, the final buzzer sounded.</p>

Sun Hu from the Second District still played the first singles match, and Chen Senrong played the second singles match. For the Fourth District, Gu Ningxian remained the first singles player, while Wang Jien played the second singles match. The skills of the two sides were very different.

<p>Second District Chen Senrong: 6|0, 6|1, 6|1 Fourth District Wang Jisi</p>
<p>▲Third District Wins Against First District　Another tennis quarterfinal match was between the Third and First Districts. In the first singles match, Zhang Jizeng from the Third District played against Wang Yuanchen from the First District. Zhang excelled in steady play, while Wang attacked fiercely with smashes. The first set was extremely tense. Wang led 6-5, but after several deuces, Zhang won two consecutive games to take the first set 9-7. Zhang continued to dominate in the second set. When the score reached 6-2, Wang left the court due to a refereeing error. Referee Qian Yiqin immediately announced Wang's default and awarded the victory to Zhang. In the second singles match, Dai Guangjin from the Third District played against Gong Zhengyi from the First District. Gong was far from his opponent's match, only taking one game in each set. He lost in straight sets. The scores are as follows:</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Quarterfinals</h3>
<p>▲Fourth District Eliminates Second District　Following the men's basketball game, the women's basketball quarterfinal match between the Second and Fourth Districts took place. The Fourth District's forwards were short but agile, and their shooting was particularly accurate. The guards were strong and had first-class ball-stealing skills. The Second District was not weak, but they encountered a superior opponent, which left them tied up. Wang Qinying, known for her agility and shooting, was closely guarded by the opponent and had no chance to shoot. As a result, they lost the first half 6-9. In the second half, they adjusted their formation and moved captain Wan Shunxiang to the forward position. The game's momentum shifted, and Wang Qinying received a pass from Wan and made a side shot with an elegant posture. However, their guards were inadequate and lost ground again, committing numerous fouls. Feng Jiexiao from the Fourth District made four out of four free throws. Despite repeated efforts, they lost by four points.</p>

<p>▲Third District Wins Against Seventh District　The match between the Third and Seventh Districts also took place at the same time on the east court. The Third District scored first in the first quarter, and the Seventh District immediately tied the score. In the second quarter, the Third District gained momentum, and Huang Lianzhen continued to score, widening the score gap.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Propriety</h3>
<p>— Suo</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper is beneficial, although sometimes it can be tedious. For example, China is the country with the most national humiliation memorial days in the world. On these days, the newspapers invariably have some records and articles. But this matter has become too repetitive and prolonged, so it is easy to become monotonous. What can be used this time can also be used next time. What was used last year may also be used next year, as long as there are no new developments. Even if there are new developments, the written text can probably still be used, because in any case, only these few words can be said. Therefore, if one is not forgetful, one will feel bored and not see any new insights.</p>
<p>However, I still read. Today, I accidentally saw an article about Beijing commemorating the anti-Japanese hero Deng Wen. First, there was a report, then a speech, and finally, "(The ceremony is completed, the music plays, and the meeting adjourns.)"</p>
<p>From this, I gained a new insight: all commemorations are only about (propriety).</p>
<p>China was originally the (Land of Propriety and Righteousness). There are three major books on propriety, which have even been translated abroad. I particularly admire the translator of the (Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial). Serving the ruler can now be set aside for discussion. Serving one's parents, of course, requires filial piety, but the methods after death have been incorporated into funeral rites, each with its own rituals, such as the current practice of observing death anniversaries and celebrating "underworld birthdays." As new death anniversaries are added, the old ones fade a little. (New ghosts are big, so old ghosts are small.) Our memorial days are also less enthusiastic about the older ones, while the newer ones fading into obscurity will have to wait for the future, just like people's death anniversaries. Some say that China's nation is based on the family, and this is a truly insightful observation.</p>
<p>China was also originally (Governed by Propriety and Concession). With propriety, there must be concession, and the more concession there is, the more elaborate the propriety becomes.</p>
<p>In short, it's better not to talk about this.</p>
<p>In ancient times, some governed the world with Huang-Lao philosophy, and some with filial piety. Now, we are probably entering a period of governing the world with propriety. Understanding this, one knows that blaming the public for their indifference to memorial days is wrong. The Book of Rites says: "(Propriety does not extend to the common people)." Being reluctant to part with material things is also wrong. Did not Confucius say: "(You, Zigong, love your sheep, but I love propriety!)"</p>
<p>(Do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety, do not speak what is contrary to propriety, do not do what is contrary to propriety). Waiting for others' "(Much unrighteousness will certainly lead to self-destruction)" is also propriety.</p>
<h3>Li Chi and Wang Guan</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>(Li Bai, bah! What are you? A banished immortal! Is your surname Li? My father's surname is also Li. Is your given name just Bai? My father's given name is Chi. Were you a Hanlin scholar? My father was no less than a recommended scholar. Is your poetry truly invincible? I am your enemy!)</p>
<p>Everyone knows that people like Li Chi suffer from megalomania. It is not that Li Bai was truly an unapproachable genius, but if you want to climb up to him, you have to show some substance. Just talking big is, after all, shameful.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Li Bai's collection includes several ci poems such as "Bodhisattva Man" and "Remembering Qin E," since the Song Dynasty, many ci poets have regarded Li Bai as the ancestor of ci poetry. Naturally, everyone has face by promoting such a great poet as their founding ancestor. When it came to Wang Guan, he seemed to regard himself as Li Bai. His "Pure Serene Music" was written in imitation of Li Bai's poems written in response to imperial edicts. The poem reads:</p>
<p>(Inside the golden palace, candle shadows of dragons at play, urging the official to truly get drunk, raising a glass and still shouting "Long live!" The beautiful women dance through "Liangzhou," and the emperor bestows a head scratch. Overnight, it is announced to reside before the emperor, how many people in the six palaces are sad.)</p>
<p>Could such a work really catch up with Li Bai? If he were able to take a piss and look at himself, he wouldn't be Li Bai. He felt that the greatest ci poet of the dynasty was Liu Yong. If he couldn't catch up with the ancient Li Bai, he could at least surpass the contemporary Liu Yong, so he actually called himself (Surpassing Liu). Many sycophantic friends also complimented him as (Surpassing Liu). However, the so-called (Surpassing Liu) poems were not famous at the time, and the few that have survived are of poor quality. Only his "Divination Song" written to send Bao Haoran to Zhejiang can be considered his immortal work. The poem reads:</p>
<p>(The water is like horizontal eyes, the mountains are like gathered brows. If you ask the traveler where he is going, it is where the brows and eyes are full of affection. Only just sending spring away, and now sending you away again. If you arrive in Jiangnan and catch up with spring, be sure to stay with spring.)</p>
<p>Such a poem might be said to surpass Liu, but unfortunately, there are too few of them. It is easy to boast, but difficult to act. Is it better to slap the mouth or the palm of the hand?</p>
<p>Throughout history, there have been many culture people suffering from megalomania. Unfortunately, even people who can't catch up with Li Chi and Wang Guan also like to boast. As the gentleman said, (This is a truly false person). How can it be called a literati?</p>
<h3>Good News</h3>
<p>— Gu Hesheng</p>
<p>A trivial matter, yet it always lingers in my mind, as if guided by an invisible thread.</p>
<p>Each time I dropped the completed manuscript into the mailbox, I was filled with hope for success. But a long time would always pass without a reply, finally confirming that my hope was an illusion, like a dream, vague and indistinct.</p>
<p>At that moment, I would begin to feel pain, regretting having undertaken the task of writing. My inner child would scold, saying:</p>
<p>(Writing again is for fools!)</p>
<p>While uttering these words, I would clench my teeth, expressing a determined attitude. One day, two days, three days, passed in regret.</p>
<p>Gradually, everything returned to peace. I seemed to have forgotten the matter of disappointment. I collected a lot of material, organized it into a novel, and again, I felt the urge to write.</p>
<p>Finally, on the morning of the fourth day, it was completed.</p>
<p>Again, I was filled with hope for success! Happily, I put the manuscript into an envelope and left. At the entrance of the post office, I paused, entered, affixed the stamp, and prepared to drop it into the green mailbox. Suddenly, it was as if someone was whispering in my ear:</p>
<p>(There is no hope!)</p>
<p>I stood there blankly for a long time before turning my head and seeing people staring at me strangely, my face turning red. Under their watchful eyes, my hand trembled like someone with rheumatism, finally quivering as I dropped it into the mailbox. I breathed a sigh of relief and rushed home, but then I regretted it again! After a while, I tried to comfort myself, my inner child saying:</p>
<p>(It's just a trivial matter, don't let it weigh on your mind!)</p>
<p>It's strange, it always itched in my heart, constantly remembering it, as if pulled by a string.</p>
<p>One day, two days... each day slowly passed.</p>
<p>Half a month later, one afternoon, I was idly daydreaming when there was a sudden knock on the door. Tap! Tap! Tap!</p>
<p>(Who is it?)</p>
<p>(Me! A letter from the XX Magazine.)</p>
<p>I knew it was the postman. The flower of hope bloomed in my heart again. I pulled open the door and quickly asked:</p>
<p>(Registered mail?)</p>
<p>(Regular mail!)</p>
<p>My heart sank, and I slightly restrained my smile. Taking the letter from the postman's hand, I smiled again! The letter was thin, so I knew it wasn't a rejection. I also thought of the notification that friends received when their manuscripts were accepted, which were just as thin as this letter.</p>
<p>(This time I've succeeded!) I thought to myself.</p>
<p>I hurried back to my seat, sat down on a rattan chair, smoked, squinted, and opened the envelope. In the dimness, I read: Mr. XX:</p>
<p>Your work is not good enough, and our publication does not intend to publish it. Since the original manuscript was not accompanied by postage, it is temporarily stored in our office. Please come and collect it in person. Wishing you peace!</p>

<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Li Yu's romances usually consist of thirty acts (with the exception of "Qiao Tuan Yuan," which has three extra acts, and "Shen Luan Jiao," which has six extra acts). Therefore, action scenes unrelated to the structure are often just superfluous. In fact, since Li Yu said, "Nine out of ten romances deal with longing" (the ending words of "Lian Xiang Ban"), why bother to insert action scenes? Although action scenes can alleviate monotony on stage, they are already extremely incoherent; on paper, they are even more tasteless.</p>
<p>Li Yu's romances often depict abnormal psychology. For example, "Lian Xiang Ban" depicts female homosexuality; "Yi Zhong Yuan" states that the bandit king Lin Tiansu prefers "North Road" (i.e., male love) and dislikes "South Road." Additionally, the childhood dream recollections in "Qiao Tuan Yuan" can be explained using Freud's abnormal psychology. "Huang Qiu Feng," which depicts a woman chasing after a man, is also rarely seen in romances.</p>
<p>"Nai He Tian" excessively humiliates female personality.</p>
<p>"Bi Mu Yu" is the most poetic of the ten dramas.</p>
<p>"Huang Qiu Feng" narrates how Cao Wanshu, Qiao Menglan, and the courtesan Xu Xiantao all want to marry Lü Yao (Zaisheng). Qiao and Xu display ingenuity, and the events are extremely bizarre. The best are the four dramas: "Dao Piao" (Paying a Prostitute First), "Xian Cu" (First Jealousy),</p>
<p>"Yin Cha" (Marriage Error), and "Zu Bing" (Obstructing Troops). In "Yin Cha," the maid, the young lady, and the courtyard worker say different things. The writing shifts perspectives three times, reaching the point of extreme elusiveness.</p>
<p>The "Ten Dramas" are mostly fictional. Only "Yi Zhong Yuan" narrates the love between Dong Qichang and Yang Yunyou, with a side narrative about Chen Meigong and Lin Tiansu. "Shen Zhong Lou" is a combination of "Liu Yi Delivers the Letter" and "Zhang Sheng Boils the Sea."</p>
<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>— Wei Mengke</p>
<p>Where is this place? I asked myself in my heart.</p>
<p>After rushing along a night road, the sun is now directly overhead. Estimating roughly, I've walked at least dozens of miles. My stomach is rumbling, each step feels heavier than the last, my eyes are already closing, and I'm sweating particularly heavily. Do I want to sleep? That would truly be madness. Damn it! Not even a dog.</p>
<p>The people's army? That doesn't matter. The tiger skin is enough to show that I'm a dignified officer! Deserting, humph! They would never expect it.</p>
<p>I haven't encountered a single person, but I've come across quite a few corpses. This is truly a bit strange. The bodies lying haphazardly on the dirt road are mostly naked. If it weren't for the hoes and carrying poles lying beside them, it would be impossible to tell whether they were soldiers or civilians. Looking at them, it seems they haven't been dead for long, because their bodies are mostly not rotten. However, only their heads have turned into terrifying skulls. At the eye, nose, and mouth sockets, swarms of flies are buzzing in and out.</p>
<p>I thought to myself that if I couldn't find food, I wouldn't be able to care about much else.</p>
<p>Finally, I reached a village, but in those empty houses, besides a few broken tables and chairs, there was really nothing else to find. I circled around in each house, becoming more anxious, and my stomach rumbled more fiercely. But finally... haha! This surprise was truly extraordinary. I suddenly used a tiger-washing-its-face posture and captured a fat rat.</p>
<p>So, on the threshing floor in front of a house, a raging fire blazed, and the broken tables and chairs served as firewood. Once the rat was in the fire, it turned into a ball of red meat, and in the smoke-filled air, one could smell a strong aroma that stimulated the nerves. This is truly unexpected, right? In the 20th century, I can still eat a primitive lunch.</p>
<p>Does anyone object to carrying cigarettes? This first delicious lunch of my life is thanks to me being a smoker and thus having a box of matches with me at all times!</p>
<p>Now the sun is setting in the west, and I'm starting my journey again, stepping over the corpses one by one.</p>
<p>I hope there are rats ahead; otherwise, I won't be able to care about much else.</p>
<h3>Stimulation (2)</h3>
<p>— Xie Bing</p>
<p>(Bing, our sedan chairs are here!)</p>
<p>Hao came in from outside, telling me with a surprised yet flustered tone.</p>
<p>(Really?) I put down my pen.</p>
<p>(Really, we saw them coming. They're at the gate now.)</p>
<p>I don't know why, but her face suddenly became serious and pale, and my heart felt a bit sour.</p>
<p>That night, Gou and I did many things, and we went to bed very late. Hao was already fast asleep.</p>
<p>I handed her the letters one by one, absolutely not daring to mention their departure tomorrow morning, and then we each lay down. I was still sleeping on the army cot; this was the third night.</p>
<p>I won't write about the moment they left and the desolation of my mood afterward; it's too painful, and this pen is absolutely unable to describe it.</p>
<p>○○○○○</p>
<p>After they left, I searched for stimulation every day.</p>
<p>I hadn't had any wine for several days, and I didn't know where to buy it. I originally wanted to take some money and randomly search, and I could probably find a wine shop. But when I thought about the watery wine that tasted like rice soup, and how drinking a whole bucket of it wouldn't give me the slightest buzz, why bother drinking it?</p>
<p>Although that's what I said, I finally drank three big bowls of it during dinner last night. I felt a little dizzy at the time, but I immediately sobered up after returning to my room and looking at some letters.</p>
<p>I was very happy in the morning. I was as active and energetic as the rising sun. My heart felt warmly comfortable, and I planned out my work for the day, resolving to start writing articles from today onward. But I don't know why, I suddenly thought of yesterday's phone call, and I got angry again. I wanted to drink some wine to get excited, but the Consumer Cooperative said they were sold out. Because I had been suffering from insomnia for several nights and my brain was overworked, I wanted to take some sleeping pills, but they wouldn't give them to me. It's ridiculous; would someone striving for the light really commit suicide?</p>
<p>This anger was no small matter. I only felt annoyed, annoyed, a hundred times annoyed. I couldn't write the article, so I had to take a newly published novel to read by the stream. The sun was warmly shining on my back, which felt quite comfortable. I read a hundred or so pages in a row, finally finishing it at half-past nine. But this novel disappointed me. Although the writing skills were not bad and the sentences were very lively, arousing the reader's interest, there were too many repeated sentences, which I found annoying. A novel is not a fairy tale, but some parts of this novel made errors similar to a fairy tale.</p>
<p>Naturally, after being disappointed, I had to find another good book to compensate for the loss. So, I read the XXXX ABC, which I had read twice eight years ago, for the third time. Naturally, I understood much more and was much more interested than back then. (To be continued)</p>

The wool market opened and immediately rose to over 70 yuan, but although it rose after opening, it still fell because the domestic situation was strengthening. However, a Reuters dispatch from Chicago stated that the US Secretary of Agriculture Wallace still advocated a controlled inflation policy, and it fell to 70 yuan. Subsequently, although he continued to state to the Grain Merchants' Association that if the purchasing power of agricultural products does not improve in the next three months, then the inflation bill will inevitably occupy a major position in the winter, etc., although it wavered, it still rose. It is said that Roosevelt's recovery movement has been met with serious resistance from the banking sector, and public sentiment is more stable. The future market rose again to over 80 yuan due to the enthusiastic buying by firms like Ruixing. The Great American Evening News carried a statement that commodity inflation would stop, but it was just commentary and not very important.

Exchange rates opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 0.25, and US exchange at 30.5 yuan. The market fluctuated during the opening session.

Fuyu and Hengyu bought aggressively, and public sentiment was quite boosted, and it rose to 8 yuan. While Guangdong firms issued US dollar orders, Hengxing frantically sold futures.

Huabi came out with January US dollar orders at 3.75, and the domestic market slightly loosened. Hongli and Qingfa issued sales orders, and it fell to 2.5 yuan. Zhengjin and Citibank bought January US dollar orders at 4.375, and Hongli and Yuanchun took advantage of the low price to enter the market, and the situation stabilized.

<p>The posted price, because the HSBC bank's US dollar listing rate reduced by 0.375 to 30.125 yuan, combined with the bullion price of over 796 yuan, was about 15.5 yuan based on the closing price, less than 3 yuan lower than the previous closing.

<h3>The Call Loan Market is Stable</h3>
<p>The overnight call loan rate remained unchanged yesterday. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 5%, with no change from the previous day. The addition of water to the hedging appeared slightly better than the previous day, with rates of around 2-3%. The silver and money industries rely entirely on the development and prosperity of various industries. In this time of decline for various industries, there is naturally no significant development. Moreover, with cautious operations, it is especially stagnant. In the clearing of call loan notes, morning market transfers amounted to 4 million, and new transactions were 8-900,000. Afternoon market transactions were over 500,000, and transactions in the Small General Association were over 600,000.

Due to the numerous marks on banknotes, over 1.4 million was collected, and over 1.84 million was issued.

<h3>Jiangsu Coins Rise, Guangdong Coins Fall</h3>

<h3>Securities and Government Bond Swap Transactions are Lively</h3>
<p>Shorts Dominate; Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, swap transactions increased, and the market gradually became lively. In multiple swap transactions, short swaps were more common. Therefore, market prices were quite firm. With the settlement period approaching, positions had not yet been balanced. In addition to secretly swapping with each other, there were also quite a few entries and exits on the market. Temporarily, it was unrelated to the current situation. Most bonds had a steady, gradual, and slight increase. However, it was said that the 96 bond was completely helpless, so it failed to rise with the crowd. Yesterday morning, the first trade still felt somewhat erratic. Customs revenue on the 19th was slightly lower by 0.1-0.2 yuan, but the rest were slightly better by about 0.1 yuan. In the second trade, various firms eagerly swapped, with swaps for the 16th, 31st, and 50th being more common, and demand was more enthusiastic, with prices continuing to rise by about 0.1-0.2 yuan. However, due to short swaps, the entire sixth-term long-term contract was slightly lower by 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, both the opening and closing trades were not lonely in various swaps, and both trades still had slight increases. Generally speaking, it was still trending upwards throughout the day, with increases ranging from 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.4-0.5 yuan. However, the increase of 0.6 yuan for gold short-term long-term contracts was the most. Among them, the 96 bond was the weakest, and the entire sixth term was not very strong. The situation belonged to mutual infighting, and it should not cause major fluctuations. The total number of transactions was 9,873,300 yuan, including 8,300 yuan in cash, 3,975,000 in unified salt tax futures, 900,000 in troop reduction, 1,030,000 in 19th customs revenue, 2,310,000 in 20th tobacco and customs revenue, 1,035,000 in sixth and 96th whole-term contracts, and the rest ranged from 20,000 to 2-300,000.</p>
<h3>Disappointment with Inflation Petition; New York Stock Market Sees Massive Selling</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 20th saw a surge in selling and falling values due to the government's cold attitude towards those requesting currency inflation. It is feared that a remedy will soon be found. Due to the weakness of the stock and cotton markets, speculators settled, causing the wheat market to also be affected and fall sharply. However, news and market conditions were still optimistic, and the East was buying. The fall in wheat prices was still favorable for buying. Due to the disappointment of the inflation petition, cotton speculators settled, and there was a large outflow from the South, as well as transactions to limit losses, causing the cotton market to decline. There was an indication that the government's attitude was about to change. The cotton production weekly report was quite good. Most transactions were purchased due to hoarding. The silver opening trend loosened due to the reaction of other markets. The total number of shares traded for the day was 2,420,000. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 103.09 Down 2.65</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 46.86 Down 2.42</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 26.58 Down 0.98</p>
<p>40 Bonds 84.47 Down 0.55</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton; Yarn Sales Have No Development Power</h3>
<p>Slight Increase in Standard Yarn Prices Immediately Triggers Selling</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the situation is still softening. Due to the unfavorable environment, any increase in prices immediately triggers selling. Moreover, all areas are affected by the recession. There is absolutely no large-scale development in yarn sales. Therefore, public sentiment is depressed. However, a certain yarn factory is buying in large quantities to go long, absorbing quite a bit continuously. Therefore, market prices are being held up by it. In short, consumption is too sluggish, and it is difficult for the market to prosper.</p>
<h3>Human Cotton Yarn Market Exhaustion</h3>
<p>The opening of the human cotton yarn market was lackluster, with foreign cotton being flat. There was a lack of buyers, and prices for various months fell by three, four, five, and six jiao. In the afternoon, it was rumored that a representative of a yarn factory had gone to Beijing to petition and had returned to Shanghai today. A meeting was held at a certain location, but the content was kept strictly secret. However, the market situation remained flat, with prices for various months rising slightly by one or two jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 23,500 bales. Sales included 1,800 bales of Ruidong, 650 bales of Changfeng, 1,000 bales of Xiesheng, 700 bales of Tonghe, 650 bales of Senkang, and 700 bales of Dafu. Purchases included 2,150 bales of Yuanda and 950 bales of Gengfeng, 800 bales of Changyu. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human Cotton Yarn Market Closing Prices (Gain/Loss) Accounting Numbers</p>
<p>December 1840 Down 4 196,700</p>
<p>September 1798 Down 4 31,250</p>
<p>January 1855 Up 1 72,100</p>
<p>October 1815 2 63,100</p>
<p>February 1860 Down 3 35,640</p>
<p>November 1829 3 73,700</p>
<p>Total 336,300</p>
<h3>Cash Sales Listless</h3>
<p>The clearance of spot yarn was greater than yesterday. According to statistics, various buying groups purchased a total of 768 bales for the day. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each buying group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 110 Guangdong 400 Ningbo 13</p>
<p>Jiangxi 120 Sichuan 10 Zhenjiang 25</p>
<h3>Divergent Trends in Domestic and Foreign Cotton Markets</h3>
<p>American cotton prices fell by two jiao because the government did not accept the price.</p>
<p>Domestic cotton prices rose due to weather changes and heavy absorption by bulls.</p>
<p>The cotton market is quite firm, but the overseas cotton market has turned downward again. The US President has no intention of accepting the maintenance of a two-jiao cotton price for inflation reasons, so the market is trending downward. However, the domestic cotton market has risen instead, possibly due to weather changes. Most cotton merchants are in a bullish position, absorbing a significant amount. It is rumored in the market that a certain seller's selling amount may not have sufficient spot goods for delivery. Therefore, the pulling force is getting stronger. However, the overall trend is not good. In the afternoon, Shenxin Factory exclusively sold more than 10,000 dan in October, and the market price slightly flattened.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Yarn Market Initially Weak, Then Rises</h3>
<p>The opening of the Zheng cotton yarn market was slightly weak due to the downward trend of US cotton, with prices for various months falling by two jiao. Gradually, prices rebounded, with prices for various months rising by five fen to one and a half jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Yao cotton flower opening price was low, and when the price rose by six jiao, the buying interest was particularly strong. However, a certain factory sold a large amount, flattening the market. As a result, prices for various months still rose by five fen. The total daily transaction volume was 127,100 dan. Sales included 4,200 dan of Dafeng, 2,200 dan of Suilong, 5,100 dan of Yuande, 3,000 dan of Tongxing, 2,600 dan of Dachang, 3,500 dan of Shenchang, and 7,600 dan of Xincheng. Purchases included 7,900 dan of Jifeng, 3,900 dan of Tongfu, 4,800 dan of Xinhua, 4,500 dan of Yifeng, 6,200 dan of Chunji, and 3,900 dan of Changfeng. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Yarn Market Closing Prices (Gain/Loss) Accounting Numbers</p>

<h3>US Cotton Bulls Liquidate, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market declined due to poor news from Liverpool, reactive selling, and bull liquidation. As a result, spot prices fell by 40 points, and futures prices fell by 40 to 46 points. Liverpool spot cotton prices rose by 13 points, and futures prices rose by 3-4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to purchases by European exporters and short covering. As a result, Pinggar rose by 3 rupees, Aumra rose by 3 rupees and 2.5 annas, and Bairohi rose by 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 20th):</p>

<h3>Private Estimates of US Cotton</h3>
<p>New York, 20th. The New York Commercial and Financial News Agency estimates this year's new cotton production at 12,191,000 bales. In addition, the Chicago Pinnett Company estimates this year's ginned cotton quantity at 2,856,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Grains: Medium-Quality Thin Rice from Zhongguan Falls Slightly by a Few Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were nearly 50 sources. After the market trend changed from yesterday afternoon, the market opening today was ordinary. Both retail and wholesale interests were slack, with a total of over 1,000 bales sold. The market situation was soft. After sellers tightened their grip, the situation slightly improved. However, the market prices for various buying groups had already fallen to varying degrees. Prices for regular groups, Sutong groups, Nangang rice, and old Dudu Foreign Pointed Rice remained stable. Other varieties, such as Qingpu and Songsi medium-quality thin rice from Zhongguan, and new pointed rice, had already seen a decline of a few jiao. Only high-quality thin rice remained popular due to scarcity. Fragrant japonica rice rebounded by a small amount of two jiao. Xieyuan rice also weakened by a few fen. There was no significant fluctuation in He Xia new japonica rice.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources from various routes in He Xia. The market saw nimble movement of various goods, with high prices. Medium and low-quality japonica rice prices softened by a few fen. The market closed stable. New rice rose slightly by nearly a jiao. New pointed rice, yuan, East-West new japonica rice, old Yangshe pointed rice, and guest pointed rice all remained flat.</p>
<h3>Main Reasons for the Weakening and Falling Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market uniformly showed a weakening and falling trend. The quoted prices of foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada fell by three, four, five, and six jiao respectively, causing widespread unease. As the delivery for this month is approaching, there are net long positions from outside the industry, creating an unavoidable situation. Guest buying groups have no intention of taking delivery due to poor sales. Some small factories within the industry also intend to hand over warehouse warrants to hedge their positions due to excessive inventory. It is said that a portion must be sold back into the market, making it difficult to avoid market weakness. Distant futures also weakened slightly due to a slight selling by factories and similar unease among investors. Based on the current situation, industry insiders speculate that this month may fall to the 1.5 jiao mark. As a result, this month's prices fell by 1.75 fen compared to the previous day, October fell by 2 fen, November fell by 2.25 fen, and December and February each fell by 1.75 fen.</p>
<h3>Both Futures and Spot Wheat Showed Flatness and Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for various months initially weakened and then stabilized. The quoted prices of foreign wheat from Chicago fell by three, four, five, and six jiao, so the market sentiment for various months was generally flat and weak at the opening, slightly down by one or two fen compared to the previous day. Subsequently, various trading sessions saw flatness and stability. This month saw slight fluctuations due to short covering. There was little activity in distant futures, and trading was quiet. Considering the flour sales, the future outlook is not promising. Furthermore, it is heard that Australian wheat is becoming active again, with a quoted price of 4.95 yuan. Attention should be paid to exchange rate fluctuations going forward. As a result, this month was unchanged, October and December were down by 0.01 yuan, January was down by 0.03 yuan, and the rest were unchanged. The spot wheat market remained flat and weak. The opening prices were: Kai Pu Zhen wheat 3.63 yuan, second grade 0.55 yuan; He Zhou wheat 3.45 yuan, second grade 0.25 yuan; Nanjing wheat 3.50 yuan, Anqing wheat 3.37 yuan; Wuhu wheat 3.47 yuan, second grade 0.42 yuan; Yangzhou wheat 3.70 yuan, exposed gluten wheat 3.73 yuan, second grade 0.70 yuan; Liuhe wheat 3.70 yuan, second grade 0.63 yuan; Zhenjiang wheat 3.53 yuan, Changshu wheat 3.67 yuan, Yaowan wheat 3.89 yuan, totaling 11,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Weight of Soybean Cake</h3>
<p>High and Low Vary by Twelve Pounds</p>
<p>It is Still the Villagers Who Suffer</p>
<p>Soybean cake has always been a major fertilizer product, with Japan being the largest overseas market. Dongsansheng (Three Northeastern Provinces) produces soybeans, so Dongsansheng is also the main producing area for soybean cake. The soybean cake from Dongsansheng is exported from Dalian, Andong, Yingkou, and other places. Before export, it undergoes strict inspection by the Oil Cake Inspection Association. The weight of each cake is uniformly 62 pounds, equivalent to 56.25 jin, so there is no issue of being abnormally light or heavy. The Jiangzhe area has always had small cakes, shaped like shoe soles but larger. Since oil factories have been established in Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places, there are also cakes produced by these factories. There are distinctions between "with edges" and "without edges," as well as between genuine brands, secondary brands, and even third, fourth, and fifth brands. The situation is deteriorating, and the quality is uneven. For clarity, a table is provided below:</p>
<p>Grade Weight (pounds)</p>
<p>Genuine Brand 62</p>
<p>Secondary Brand 60</p>
<p>Third Brand 58</p>
<p>Fourth Brand 54</p>
<p>Fifth Brand 50</p>
<p>The above are the weights of each cake. Even within the same cake, the weight difference can be as much as 12 pounds. The reason for this is that oil factories are greedy for business and cater to inland merchants. Oil factories sell soybean cakes to inland cake merchants, pricing them by weight. The weight varies, and the prices also vary. However, inland cake merchants sell them to farmers by the cake, regardless of the weight. Therefore, between this buying and selling, in addition to the official profit, there is also extra income. Farmers are unaware and are deceived. Oil cake manufacturers should rectify this improper behavior themselves, standardize the weight, and eliminate all sorts of names, striving for uniformity with the products of Dongsansheng. The government should also conduct inspections upon leaving the factory to prevent such behavior from recurring and to prevent farmers with difficult economic circumstances from being exploited.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Chuang Zhenyu Factory Refined White Sugar Opens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was particularly tight due to the sudden rise in bid prices, higher customs duties, and a shrinking Dutch exchange rate. Public Zeng and Liu's 24th grade coarse granulated white sugar rose by 0.3 yuan to 21.8 yuan but did not trade. Transshipment goods opened at a Dutch currency rate of 8.025 yuan (excluding tax), and 20th grade medium granulated white sugar opened at 21 yuan. Dutch Red PK mark rose by 0.1 yuan to 16.6 yuan. Zhonghua Guohua No. 1 refined white sugar opened at 20.65 yuan. In addition, the newly established Zhenyu Sugar Factory behind Jin Liyuan Warehouse produced refined white sugar, which was of excellent quality. Using an airplane as a trademark, it was divided into five types: No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and was highly praised by those in need. Yesterday, it opened with No. 1 at 20.6 yuan, No. 2 at 20.4 yuan, No. 3 at 20.2 yuan, No. 4 at 20 yuan, and No. 5 at 19.8 yuan, a price increase of 0.2 yuan compared to the previous prices of other factories. Taigu sugar B mark opened at 21.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Shi Ma Longan Rises by More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>The harvest of new Shi Ma longan this year is very poor. Only a few dozen boxes of the second batch have arrived. Samples were seen yesterday and immediately opened for sales. The price of the genuine brand rose by more than ten yuan. The price increase of the secondary brand was even greater. Scarcity makes it valuable, and it is extremely popular.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Tea from Wubei is Actively Sold in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from the Wuyuan North Road was slightly more actively sold in Europe. Jinlong and Baochang and other companies purchased more than 500 boxes. The selling price has not changed. There were also sporadic transactions of Zhenmei tea from Tunxi and Shexian roads. However, the market price fell by about one or two yuan. The transactions of other items such as eyebrow tea, Gongxi tea, and shrimp eye tea were sluggish. Although experts discussed black tea from Qimen and Fuliang roads, there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Horsehair Interlining, and Printed Calico Rise Again</h3>
<p>(Horsehair Interlining) This product is essential for making suits. High-end custom-made clothing uses imported black carbon interlining. The next best is domestic Ningbo Jiangshan interlining because it is cheaper. Shops adjust the price based on the customer's willingness to pay. Yesterday, black carbon interlining was extremely scarce. Foreign companies could not source any, so cloth was very popular. Wholesale prices opened at 1.6 yuan, and retail prices were 1.75 yuan. The price of Jiangshan interlining also rose. A 9-inch width sold for 0.28 yuan, an increase of 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>(Printed Calico) Because of the [missing characters] and addition, the price had previously increased by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Yesterday, it rose sharply again. Since the cost of new goods is very high, sellers are generally hoarding and raising prices. Buyers need the cloth urgently for autumn clothing, so they are willing to pay higher prices. Yesterday, Deji Five Road imported printed calico, and the wholesale price was uniformly 0.6 yuan per yard. For retail cuts, an additional 0.02 to 0.03 yuan is required. Before the [missing characters] tax was announced, it was sold for only 0.5 yuan per yard.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>On the Fire of Desire</h3>
<p>Desire is something that all humans share, perhaps a reliable iron law like the saying that all mortals must eat and drink.</p>
<p>However, human desires have vastly different variations, and rarely coincide. For example, the most fashionable figures in the world today are people like Hitler and Mussolini. Due to admiration, no, perhaps due to the needs of the times, there are many people who desire to emulate such figures for a lifetime. At the same time, non-resistance generals like Gandhi can also stir up the desires of some people. There are those who only want to engage in speculative trading in the land of gold and silver that is Shanghai, and there are those who want to develop rich resources in the Northwest. There are those who buy construction lottery tickets in the hope of becoming rich overnight, and there are those who save five li of money in the bank every day, hoping to accumulate bit by bit. People sitting in rickshaws want to get to their destination quickly, but they encounter situations where they have to yield to cars, causing them to slow down for a few minutes. As a result, they easily develop the desire to ride in a car. Rickshaw pullers, who pull until their bones ache and they are exhausted, are still unable to make ends meet, and they develop the desire to be someone who rides in a rickshaw.</p>
<p>The reason why desires have such significant differences is based on differences in environment and personality. If the environment is too oppressive and one is also slow-witted, then such people, for example, the cook next door, only have, and in fact are only allowed to have, the desire for the day when they become the boss of a restaurant.</p>
<p>However, desires are also inspired and developed by the environment.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although desires differ in how they reside, there is a common essence, and that is that desires are inevitably upward, exceeding the current level. If it is the opposite, then it is not called desire, but (complacency), (conservatism), or even (decline).</p>
<p>Since the primary meaning of desire is (upward), there is then a characteristic, which is (improving reality) and (a bright future). That is to say, the shadows of desire are all beautiful and bursting forth. The future is paved with tiles, not a muddy, smoky road.</p>
<p>At this point, the ultimate goal of desire is very clear, which is (enjoyment). Generally speaking, when desire is fulfilled, it is... What is desired. This is what is called desire in this world, its starting point is climbing upward, stepping on others to climb upward, and its ultimate point is enjoyment, enjoying the pleasure of others. The times are such times, (money) and (enjoyment) have become the sole pursuit of mankind, and the desires of ordinary people are directed at (money) and (enjoyment), and nothing else can be said.</p>
<p>In fact, there seem to be exceptions, such as those who believe in religion. Their desires are indeed somewhat different, only wishing to become (living Buddhas) or (living masters), and to ascend to (celestial realms) or (heaven) after death. However, such people are ultimately too few, and such desires are not essential to humanity or reality, because they are too evasive of the greatest meaning of life.</p>
<p>So, what kind of desires does humanity need? In my opinion, there are the following two:</p>
<p>(1) The desire for knowledge. This is not only something that young people who are currently in school should have, but something that all mortals should have. No matter the environment, we should have the desire and determination to seek knowledge, whether from books or from experiencing life, both are equally important. A human history can be said to be directed by knowledge, and even more so is a continuation of knowledge. Humanity's only specialty is knowledge.</p>
<p>(2) The desire for a career. What most people lack today is the desire for a career, only the desire for (money) and (enjoyment). If one has the desire for a career, one will surely be able to overcome all distorted desires and become a meritorious servant of humanity, a creator of society. Humanity needs this kind of desire to develop the future world, and only such people can stand tall and dominate in the future world. This is the greatest meaning of humanity, and it is worthy of our praise.</p>

<p>Modern Celebrity Paintings and Calligraphy</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Wenyun's Ink Bamboo (Brief Biography)</p>
<p>Zhu Wenyun, courtesy name Wenyin, pseudonym Tianmu Shanmin, is from Xiaofeng, Zhejiang. He is skilled in painting flowers and birds, and his ink bamboo is especially prized. He studied with Mr. Wu [missing character]. His family carvings and calligraphy all possess the refined interest of the Qin and Han dynasties. He served as the director of the Chinese painting department at Shanghai Art College and Hehua Art College for more than ten years. His students are all over the country. After class, he and three or five like-minded friends organized the Bai Society to study calligraphy, painting, bronze inscriptions, and stone inscriptions.</p>
<h3>Idiot Yuan Zhi</h3>
<p>In the stories circulating among the people, there is such a character:</p>
<p>His wife told him to sell cloth, saying to sell it to (hard) people. He hung it on the wooden idols in the temple. When he returned home, his wife scolded him and told him to take the cloth back. On the road, he saw a funeral procession, and the women were wearing white cloth on their heads, so he went up and tore it off, resulting in a beating. After returning home, his wife told him that when he saw a funeral procession, he should express grief and help to cry. He remembered this. Later, when he saw a wedding procession, he cried loudly, resulting in another beating. His wife then told him that things decorated with red ribbons were joyful events and should be congratulated. So, when he saw a fire, he offered congratulations. His wife said that when you see a fire, you should help put it out. So, he poured water on the blacksmith's furnace. Finally, when he saw two water buffaloes fighting, he remembered his wife's teaching, saying that when you see people fighting, you should go up and mediate. He went up to mediate. As a result, he died under the horns of the water buffalo.</p>
<p>Honest villagers call such a person an (idiot) and laugh at him with pity, but I regret that China has not produced a Cervantes, so such a character has not been depicted in literary works. Otherwise, where would that Spanish literary giant's (Don Quixote) come from? Look at the various episodes listed above. Are they inferior to Don Quixote's (attacking windmills), (greatly defeating the Biscayan gentleman), (recognizing the inn as a castle), (challenging lions), (seizing the golden helmet)... various battles? And look at the ending, isn't it the same as Don Quixote's?</p>
<p>Don Quixote single-mindedly believed in knight-errant novels, and our (idiot) single-mindedly believed in (rules for women). This point is also the same. (The difference is that Don Quixote had a disciple who was almost [missing characters], while our (idiot) had a smart wife. However, even with such a wife, it did not help the tragedy caused by that personality丨丨some people say it is a comedy.</p>
<p>It has only been twenty [missing character] since the publication of Lin Shu's translation of (Don Quixote), and brother and I are [missing character], for great men to read. But our folk story has been circulating for a long time. I dare to assert that there is absolutely no influence of Cervantes' masterpiece in it. Even today, more than twenty years after Don Quixote was published, the narrator's words in the folk story will never incorporate any shadow of Don Quixote. What causes us to think deeply here is why similar characters and stories would emerge coincidentally in the literature and legends of the East and West?</p>
<p>This story is really a great story, and its meaning is very broad. If we want to find a lesson, we can get a lot from it.</p>
<p>First, as Turgenev pointed out, it expresses one of the permanent dualities of human nature. (The first meaning is to think about things, set aside the intention of gain or loss, and act solely on one's own true and unadorned heart, never compromising, and just getting things done), (Chuanbaicun's words), is (Don Quixote), is the so-called idiot. However, such an idiot is precisely the kind of person necessary for cultural development, and is of much higher value than a clever person (who bends his crooked knees into eight curves of wisdom before tradition and idols). Especially the kind of (selflessness) and (for others) spirit possessed by the idiot in our folk stories is most needed and rare in today's society.</p>
<p>Second, it makes us think about the issue of education. If Don Quixote had not read knight-errant novels in the first place, and if our smart wife could teach her husband the correct basic knowledge, then their outcome would certainly not have been so bad. From this, we can see how necessary correct education is. Among today's humans, only children still retain that precious (idiot) nature. Unfortunately, today's education either turns them into clever people or turns them into absurd people. Speaking of guidelines, most are (treat the headache when the head hurts, and treat the foot when the foot hurts.) and like the idiot's wife.</p>
<p>Third, the (treat the headache when the head hurts, and treat the foot when the foot hurts) phenomenon mentioned above is not only true in the education sector. Even national plans are like this. Since the Opium War, when we suffered losses from the foreign adults, our national planners have never had a correct plan (military warfare is not as good as commercial warfare.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>commercial warfare is not as good as industrial warfare) all the way to the present, democratic systems, communism, fascism, five-year plans, cup [missing character] sports, non-resistanceism... Seeing that others have achieved something, we also imitate them, but I don't know why we are always one step behind, acting at the wrong time. Moreover, we do not implement them thoroughly, cleverly stopping or changing at the appropriate place, with no trace of the idiot's courage and forward momentum.</p>
<p>Therefore, our era needs idiots, and at the same time, it needs correct education.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Amateur Mailbox</h3>
<p>Previously, this space in our publication was used for "Shop Assistant Correspondence." It was created by this newspaper during its sixtieth anniversary, recognizing that many shop assistants and apprentices in this city had difficulties and lacked opportunities for mutual exchange. Its target audience was originally limited to shop assistants and apprentices. However, aside from shop assistants and apprentices, there were many others in this city with similar needs. They enthusiastically submitted letters for communication. Initially, we were very strict about the target audience, leading to the regretful rejection of many valuable questions. Later, partly because questions specifically about shop assistants and apprentices were quite monotonous, and partly because we felt there was no reason to reject correspondence from readers outside of this group, we gradually relaxed our restrictions on the target audience. Recently, the correspondence we have published has come from workers, educators, and even administrative personnel. In practice, it has naturally transitioned from "Shop Assistant Correspondence" to "Amateur Mailbox." Now, to ensure that the name matches the reality, we are directly and decisively renaming it "Amateur Mailbox." Based on past experience, we know that aside from letters raising specific practical questions, some letters merely express personal opinions on a certain issue or describe the situation in a certain context. From now on, for letters raising practical questions, the editors will provide sincere replies to the best of their ability, publishing those with broad relevance and of urgent interest to the general public in this column. The rest will be answered directly by mail from this column (please clearly state your address in the letter). As for letters expressing opinions, we will select those with considerable value and publish them in this column without commentary. We also welcome readers to engage in discussions, hoping to establish a consensus in society. As for descriptions of current situations, we will publish a small number of extremely reasonable and extremely unreasonable cases in installments for all parties to learn from; otherwise, no replies will be given. In short, the focus of our work from now on will be on responding to letters; published texts will be carefully selected, prioritizing the interests of the public. We would rather have gaps than publish carelessly.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (III) (10) (Four-Act Play) Ling He</h3>
<p>Act Three: Ode to Peace</p>
<p>Military Authority: You're here. Children, go upstairs and play with your auntie. (The young master follows the wife upstairs.)</p>
<p>Young Master: Daddy! Come teach me to play mahjong later, okay?</p>
<p>Military Authority: Um, ask your auntie to teach you.</p>
<p>Young Master: No, I want you to come. I won't leave if you don't come.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Okay, I'll come later. (Watching their figures disappear). That child is so disobedient. Doesn't read books, just wants to mess around all day long.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: No, Young Master is actually very smart.</p>
<p>Military Authority: (Happy smile.) How is it? Did you meet with Committee Member Tian?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Yes, I did. His view is that since the government has such determination, the matter can be handled very well now. Last night, as soon as he received that telegram, he went to visit the acting minister at the Japanese embassy. It is said that the embassy agrees very much that we can sacrifice our prejudices and peace is not difficult to achieve. However, he does not yet know what the Kwantung Army Command thinks. According to the Japanese acting minister, we must send a representative to Miyun. The embassy can also send someone to go with us to negotiate directly with the Kwantung Army.</p>
<p>Military Authority: So, has the embassy already forwarded our authorities' views to Tokyo?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Committee Member Tian did ask them about this. It is said that he has already telegraphed for instructions. It seems Tokyo is not a problem; they can take responsibility for that. However, he is generally worried about whether the Kwantung Army will completely agree, which is the problem, so it is best if we can negotiate in person.</p>
<p>Military Authority: It is evident that the Japanese warlords are truly autocratic... Then, does Committee Member Tian have any opinions regarding the selection of the representative?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: He didn't express any opinion, but I think even if you offer any opinions, he may not publicly oppose them.</p>
<p>Military Authority: I don't have any preconceived notions about this. But what do you think of my brother-in-law?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Very good, very good!</p>
<p>Military Authority: I want to let him give it a try. He has asked me several times to introduce work for him. He doesn't want to do small things, and there aren't good opportunities for big things. I think this time, although it's not such a remarkable job, it is not necessarily a place to advance.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Excellent, excellent. And wasn't he a consul in Nagasaki before? Now, having him negotiate with the Japanese is really putting his talents to good use.</p>
<p>Aide-de-camp: (From outside) A foreigner has come to see you. (Hands a card to the Military Authority)</p>
<p>Military Authority: Who is it? The manager of the Kailuan Mining Company. Is there a Chinese person with him?</p>
<p>Aide-de-camp: No.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Then, what about Secretary Shi? What should we do without an interpreter?</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: I think we don't need an interpreter. He can speak Chinese.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Oh? Then please invite him in. (The Confidential Secretary retreats behind the velvet curtain. A foreign mine owner enters.)</p>
<p>Mine Owner: Since your country has implemented military resistance, our company's coal has suffered significant losses due to transportation difficulties. Therefore, we hope that your government will fully protect our inherent interests according to the provisions of the treaty. In promoting the friendly relations between the British Empire and your country, we hope to hear your Excellency's satisfactory reply immediately.</p>

<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists (1)</h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>To enable the audience to have a more in-depth understanding of Chinese film artists than they currently have, and to provide an opportunity for progressive artists to connect with the audience, I believe that this type of interview is not entirely meaningless.</p>
<p>However, it must be stated here that our interviews are by no means an obligatory promotion for a few artists. Similarly, in addition to recording conversations, we must also provide a kind of objective and subjective criticism. Moreover, the order of publication has no significance due to time or work-related constraints. 丨丨 The above is considered a preface.</p>
<p>XXXXXXXX</p>
<p>1.  Director Bu Wancang of "Light of Motherhood."</p>
<p>We, the audience who pay attention to Chinese films, will not easily overlook this director. Precisely because he is an artist valued by people, I visited Lianhua Film Studio Number One to pay him a visit.</p>
<p>A person who shoulders a heavy responsibility is always very busy in his career, but after a little twist and turn, I finally met him.</p>
<p>As usual, when introducing a certain important person, one must depict a few qualities on his person. Thus, my description of him is: if someone does not know about his family wealth, they would definitely think that he is a wealthy son of a rich family. At least his belly is big enough to hold a lot, although it is not necessarily all beef juice or chicken soup. However, to say something complimentary, that would be "full of knowledge and talent." A man of knowledge and talent, and full of it, is naturally a remarkable talent.</p>
<p>He is very straightforward and amiable, which can be seen on his face. For example, his thick and large hand, when he shakes your hand, can be said to be both painful and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Space is limited, so let's not digress. Anyway, he is the father of two children. Probably no amorous woman will fall in love with this big fat man because of my simple description. Just kidding.</p>
<p>After we sat down and exchanged greetings, before tea was served, I asked:</p>
<p>(May I ask, sir, what are your opinions on Chinese films?)</p>
<p>Naturally, this was a very vague question. I immediately regretted asking it. However, since it had already been said, there was no way to take it back. I saw him think for a moment and immediately respond fluently. If I were to compare him to a top student in the oral examination of the Examination Yuan, then I would be honored to be the President of the Examination Yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Film Reviews)</p>
<h3>Review of "Way Down East" (Lai Hun)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hong</p>
<p>Originally, this was a famous work from the silent film era. Now, due to the addition of sound, I will also provide a brief review.</p>
<p>First, we must know that this director, D.W. Griffith, is the oldest figure in the American film industry. Just his first use of "close-up" (C.P.) shots proves his contribution to film. "Way Down East" is undoubtedly very successful in its emotional tone. It is an indelible record in film history. To be precise, it is a living tragedy, a mournful lyric poem.</p>
<p>Regarding his directorial methods, the famous Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein also sincerely admired him. He admitted that he learned a lot from D.W. Griffith. At the same time, he should be the teacher of directors around the world. However, we will certainly not unconditionally accept all of his methods and techniques, but rather critically accept them from a correct standpoint. This is a necessary understanding for us to receive the legacy of our predecessors.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, D.W. Griffith's peasant consciousness is very strong. He curses the dirty love of the bourgeoisie and opposes the feudal society's old-fashioned killing. However, he is heroic and advocates using love between people to explain this ugliness. Thus, the young David comes to heroically save Anna, and people ultimately sympathize with Anna and hate Sanderson. At the same time, he writes Anna as a completely cowardly person (although she did scold Sanderson, she ultimately did not resist), allowing her to gain people's full sympathy. Therefore, the author is ultimately not a fighter against feudalism, but rather a sentimental poet born in a feudal society, a complete idealist, and a lover-first advocate.</p>
<p>In this way, we certainly cannot accept his ideas. At the same time, we will naturally learn the techniques of the work that conveys these ideas critically; otherwise, we will become the inheritors of these ideas.</p>
<p>However, we have no reason to ignore this historical work. On the contrary, we can trace the past traces of film history in this classic.</p>
<p>Lillian Gish is naturally very successful. All the other actors are also very good.</p>
<p>Regarding the addition of sound, we certainly agree very much with enhancing the effectiveness of the drama. This, like the (effects) of Zou Tai Opera, can make up for the shortcomings of silent films. However, it certainly should not be like in "City Lights," where the dialogue is dubbed into a kind of incomprehensible strange noise. 丨The above is exactly the case in "Way Down East."</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Flaws in "To Shanghai"</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>"To Shanghai" uses "promoting literacy" and "popularizing education" as its background.</p>
<p>The plot tells the story of two countrymen who travel together "to Shanghai." They encounter many jokes along the way. Later, they bravely put out a fire and win the favor of two young ladies, who reward them with half of their family property. They feel the "bitterness of illiteracy" and the "lack of popular education" (inconvenient transportation). They contribute money to establish a primary school and a small train in their hometown. Soon, they receive the young ladies' promise of marriage and inherit the legacy of their fathers-in-law.</p>
<p>The director's performance in this film is very mediocre, without any amazing techniques. There are many small flaws. For example, when Wang and Jiang get off the car halfway to ask for directions, they would not be so stupid as to be frightened and run away upon seeing soldiers and policemen and postal workers. In my humble opinion, they would not be so timid. Since they are illiterate, why do they recognize the words "Oriental Hotel (饭店)"?</p>
<h3>Loretta Young's Cake-Eating Skills</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>In the film "A Man's Castle," directed by Frank Borzage and starring Columbia Pictures actress Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy, there is a scene where she has to eat a large piece of raspberry cake. Unexpectedly, this scene had to be reshot three or four times, and Loretta Young had to eat a large piece of raspberry cake each time. As a result, she ate as many as four or five pieces, until she couldn't even open her mouth. Fortunately, this scene was finally filmed, and Miss Young went home. Her maid brought up dinner and asked her to eat. Loretta Young looked at the food with disgust and ordered the maid to take it away. The maid respectfully withdrew and then brought up a plate of exquisite desserts. Loretta Young took one look at the desserts and sighed, "I knew it. It must be raspberry cake again. I have been fighting a lawsuit with raspberry cake all day today, and I still haven't settled it yet." The actress's expressions contain a lot of artificiality and are mediocre.</p>
<h3>Opinions After Watching "Man Jiang Hong"</h3>
<p>— Fu Li</p>
<p>"Man Jiang Hong" is a long novel of hundreds of thousands of words. It is indeed impossible to adapt it into a film script without some loopholes.</p>
<p>There are several flaws that we need to discuss, such as:</p>
<p>(1) Li Taozhi and Wan Youguang set off to Shanghai to get married. Yu Shuicun got the news from Xiaoxiang and immediately went to Shanghai to find Taozhi. Shuicun is a poor friend. How can he afford to stay in such a luxurious hotel in Shanghai? The expenses for staying in the hotel are unknown. (2) Shuicun heard Youguang and Taozhi getting married from the waiter's mouth in the hotel. It seemed that the waiter already knew Shuicun's intentions and spoke directly about it, which is rather far-fetched.</p>
<p>(3) In the scene when the ship caught fire, the scenery was too simple. When the male and female passengers fled, there was no sign of panic or anxiety. Moreover, there were no crew members, sailors, or life-saving equipment. The director is really to blame for these oversights.</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors, Hu Die, Gong Jianong, and Wang Xianzai are the most competent. However, Wang Zhengxin's portrayal of Liang Qiushan in the hospital scene is too lacking in illness and is not very similar. The rest are average. The lighting is very clear. The dubbing is also good. In short, "Man Jiang Hong" is still worth watching.</p>
<h3>The Appearance of the "Sanyoushi" Radio</h3>
<p>In 1933, Chinese films made significant progress. At the same time, there were amazing achievements in the manufacturing of machinery. Recently, the "Sanyoushi" radio was tested in a large hospital in Shanghai, and someone from our publication participated in the event. The results were very good. Several foreign radio technicians present praised it highly. Yesterday, it was heard that this radio is still under continued research and is not intended to be released to the public urgently. This shows the seriousness and effort of the manufacturer.</p>
<h3>Yi Hua Film Stars Participate in Yellow River Flood Relief</h3>
<p>— Ling Yin</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yi Hua film stars participated in the Yellow River flood relief performance. The program included Yuan Meiyun ("Su San Goes to Court"), Hu Jia's ("Wish You Good Night"), Huang Naishuang's ("Farewell Song"), Chen Juanjuan's ("Red Rose"), and Zhou Zhilong's fire circle skills, etc. Among them, the little female actor Yuan Meiyun originally belonged to Peking Opera. This play was originally her specialty, but her voice was not cooperating. Hu Jia was originally a famous singer and dancer, and her singing was like pearls rolling on a jade plate. Chen Juanjuan is only five years old, but she is big, and she danced very naturally under the gaze of thousands of eyes, which is rare. I have seen Huang Naishuang on the screen many times, but it was my first time meeting her on stage. Her "Farewell Song" was melodious and touching, it is said. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Mingxing Photography Crew's News from the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>The Mingxing photography crew went to Mount Hua on the 10th to film. Directed by Cheng Bugao, they are producing "To the Northwest." The mountain is steep and the scenery is excellent. The actors Xu Lai and Gong Jianong performed very energetically. Soon, they will go to Mount Zhongnan to shoot location shots. On the evening of the 14th, the photography crew arrived in Xi'an. On the 15th, Shaanxi Province Chairman Shao Lizhi held a banquet for the entire Mingxing crew, and after the banquet ordered the Construction Department to send a public bus and guards to escort them to the Jinghui Canal for filming. He gave great encouragement to the crew members.</p>
<h3>Mei Xi Officially Joins Mingxing</h3>
<p>Mei Xi, a student of the Mingxing Film Company's attached actor training school, is physically strong, graceful and refreshed, and his appearance is very similar to Jin Yan. The directors of Mingxing all believe that he is a very promising screen talent. Mei Jun played the leading role in Li Pingqian's "Harvest Year." The films have been shot with excellent results. Now Mei Jun will soon officially join Mingxing as a basic actor, it is said.</p>
<h3>Mingxing Implements Weekly Holidays</h3>
<p>In the past year, the film industry in China has aroused great attention from society. Mingxing Company, due to its historical position, is conserving its energy and striving to improve. On the one hand, it is striving to improve the content of its products and increase production. On the other hand, it is striving to improve the internal working situation. The company has now implemented an eight-hour work day and weekly rest starting this week.</p>

<h3>Small Toys (10)</h3>
<p>— Yuan Congmei</p>
<p>In the house of Sister-in-law Ye, she was sitting at the table working non-stop. The skinny old man and Mantis Qian were helping out. Old Zhao was smoking there. At this time, Zhuer and A Yong were on the haystack outside the house, back to back, quietly staring at the moon in a daze... Happiness was active in their spirits. The two were dissolving in a fairyland of sweet love...</p>
<p>(Zhuer! When will your toy factory be opened?...) A Yong finally spoke first.</p>
<p>(Soon, my mother said: As long as we believe in ourselves and hold our heads high, we will succeed one day!) Time flies like an arrow, and ten years pass in a flash. Yuan Pu also returned home after completing his studies and opened a toy factory. One day, a wealthy widow, Mrs. Chen, brought Yu'er (bought from the kidnapper ten years ago) to visit the Xinghua Toy Factory. Yuan Pu respectfully led them. Mrs. Chen praised, but he recalled Sister-in-law Ye and was saddened! He had also visited Liuye Village by Taihu Lake to visit Sister-in-law Ye: but her house had become a broken wall, and the outside was full of scorched earth... Hungry dogs... Beggars... As miserable as a desolate tomb! Terrible!</p>
<p>○○○○○</p>
<p>Under the accelerated iron hooves of imperialism trampling on the Chinese market, our Sister-in-law Ye and her smart daughter are still struggling with great courage.</p>
<p>At first, Sister-in-law Ye and Zhuer thought that the toy airplanes, warships, and soldiers from overseas would at most only make them and many people who rely on their fingers for food eat a few less bites of food... Until one evening 丨 the evening of January 28th, the hideous mask of imperialism was unveiled. Economic aggression had turned into military aggression. The toy airplanes, cannons, and warships had become real ones to attack. However, our heroic 19th Route Army was resisting the imperialist guns. Every day was in a tense bloodbath! This</p>
<p>At that time, Sister-in-law Ye, Zhuer, A Yong, and Old Zhao were all frightened and huddled in a country, listening quietly, and looking at each other, without saying a word. The cannon roared, and the roof tiles also fell.</p>
<p>(Run for your lives! The enemy's artillery fire is fierce. Our soldiers are certainly not enough to fight them.) The skinny old man's voice trembled.</p>
<p>(Who says Chinese people dare not fight foreigners? I don't believe it! Those of you who are timid can just run away... I won't run!) Zhuer was so brave from the start. (To be continued)</p>
