<p>蘇俄出售中東路</p>
<h3>我外交部提出嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>駁李維諾夫中俄恊定失效言論</p>
<p>日將覆俄向僞國開議出售中東路</p>
<p>僞交部擬接收中東路全部管理權</p>
<p>（南京）　外交部以蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫、將中東路出售問題、態度轉變、深爲駭異、特於十三晚提出抗議、除送致俄大使鮑格莫洛夫外、並電致駐俄大使顏惠慶、轉致李維諾夫、謂李稱我政府已十八個月未出席、</p>
<p>該路理事會、故中東路協定、事實上已失效等語、此實蘇聯政府未曾明聽我政府十八個月以來、未能派代表出席之原因、並非自願放棄、查協定所規定之權力與義務、乃因某種情形之下、暫時無法繼續此項權力與義務時、並不能即謂永久不能繼續此項權力、此時祇能認爲暫時一種、</p>
<p>障碍、不能因此即根本廢止、且造成此原因之責任、並不在我、（十三日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）　外交部以李維諾夫宣稱準備出售中東路、此舉顯違中俄協定、有損我國主權、特向蘇聯提嚴重抗議、十三日晚已電達我駐俄大使館、向俄提出、同時并致送俄大使轉該國政府、外部定十四日下午四時正式公布抗議書全文云、（十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　中國大使顏惠慶今日告美聯社記者、蘇聯出售中東路於僞組織之議、將在中國及其他多數國家間發生非常不良印象、渠業於星期二夜間訪外交副委員加拉罕、强硬抗議蓋此舉不僅非法與不合理、且明白違犯現行條約、查中俄協定内規定該路之前途、必須由中俄兩政府决定之、今中國因迫於武力、暫時不能在滿洲行使職權、絕對不能影響其對於鐵路之法定權利、而此事之發生即在中俄甫經恢復友誼關係之後、尤爲可遺憾云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）　東京官塲聞俄外長李維諾夫關於中東路之言論、頗具良好印象、因李氏之言拒絕中國之抗議、並重伸蘇俄欲將中東路售與「滿洲國」之意也、報稱「滿洲國」築路程序、現已完成、中東路之價値、因以大减、故此路估價時必須顧及此點、日政府將答覆蘇俄向「滿洲國」開議中東路出售事云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄態度</h3>
<p>（哈爾濱）　「滿洲國」要求蘇俄交還車輛之期限已於昨夜半屆滿、雖推測紛紜、但「滿洲國」有何舉動、現尙未悉、據此間白俄報稱、此事有互讓之可能、俄總領事已接莫斯科訓令、如「滿洲國」堅持、不妨謀取和平解决、俄政府於必要時可撤回中東路俄總辦魯迪云、日人所辦之哈爾濱時報、即屢次攻擊中東路俄員者、現謂自昨夜起「滿洲國」僞交通部已從中東路滿員手中接收　項交涉事宜、滿方現已正式不承認前有之北平與瀋陽協定、而主張廢止之、如蘇俄必欲認爲有效、則蘇俄須向張學良及南京中政府商榷之、但若蘇俄欲參加中東路之共同開拓、則當抛棄自一九二○年九月二十七日加拉罕發出牒文起至一九三一年九一八瀋陽事變止時期中之各種事件、現有之經騐、已證明中東路俄員之非法行爲、已摧毀協定之基本原則、故此協定不復有可認爲有效之理由、「滿洲國」僞交通部現已接辦此項交涉、將正式宣佈不欲依照此種協定辦理云、李紹庚昨日午後已呈報僞交通部、蘇俄迄未遵限交還其所扣車輛、此間人士預料僞交通部將設法接收中東路全部管理權、滿洲里俄人因外貝加爾路與中東路已不通車、無事可爲、故現紛紛返國、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本政策</h3>
<p>（東京）　買收中東路問題、先由軍部决定方針、然後交外務省照辦、陸軍參謀本部關於買收之具體辦法已作成、現俟眞崎次長回東京後開會、决定之後交陸軍省、聞參謀本部對於買收該鐵路之意見如下據李特維諾夫聲明及蘇俄當局之說明、蘇俄出賣中東路之目的在於除去因該路而發生之日滿俄間紛爭根源、故日政府可以諒解俄方誠意、買收之價値軍部及滿鐵雖有調查、然應就現收决定買價「滿洲國」鐵路政策完成之日中東路之價値必然減少、故買收時期應考慮此點、後始可决定、買主爲滿鐵或「滿洲國」尙示决定、然視將來之關係、使「滿洲國」買收則有利、（十三日日聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>出賣中東路能避免日蘇衝突乎（晦·）</h3>
<p>蘇聯出售中東路。已由李維諾夫之談話正式證明。其所持理由。僅爲我國十八個月以來不能在東北三省境内。行使其政治的權力。殊不知中日衝突。迄今并未了結。中國人民尤未承認日本帝國主義之强占。且正竭其全力以從事於反日工作。雖爲當前環境所限。未克奏與日爭鬭之功。固亦未嘗肯自甘屈服也。</p>
<p>吾人猶憶中蘇第一次復交時。蘇聯駐華人使爲現任外交人民委員會副委員長加拉罕。彼時我國即有人責問蘇聯。何以不肯退還中東路。似此不免留有侵略我國之嫌。在中蘇親善上遺不潔之跡。加拉罕當時之答詞。大意爲「中國政府（指北京臨時政府）不足以代表人民。更無力控制帝國主義。設使中東路而還付中國者。則不免爲地方軍閥所刦制。而轉入帝國主義者之手。此於中國革命不利。於蘇聯尤有損。故不如由蘇聯執掌。反較穩妥…。」以此立論爲蘇聯解說。圓滿週到。於中國革命前途。亦似有助力。不謂時至今日。蘇聯爲日本帝國主義所迫。欲維持其傳統的和平外交。即不惜專就片面之利害而出售中東路。吾人不知今日之日本帝國主義。有異於一九二五年之日本乎。其對中國與蘇聯行動之横暴。進攻之急激。不更甚以前乎。</p>
<p>假使蘇聯爲日本武力所屈。或中東路兩端均爲日本軍國主義之暴力所封鎖。蘇聯爲尋求所以自保。不得已而讓渡中東路。猶可說也。各弱小民族及被壓迫者或猶可同情也。今蘇聯乃自動提議出售。致遺日本以口實。謂蘇聯經濟困難。欲以出賣中東路所得資金。借資國際收支之平衡。而奠第二五年。</p>
<p>計劃之根基。此種風傅。匪特有損蘇聯社會主義新國家之國際威信。且其策劃甚愚。所得亦有限也。</p>
<p>第一·出售中東路不能緩和日蘇衝突。更不能因此即謂足以換取和平。吾人回憶日本承認蘇聯恢復蘇日國交之際。蘇聯曾以北庫頁半島爲和平代價。用博日本之歡。曾幾何時。遂次及於中東路矣。况日本之侵略我國。刦持中東路。以遮斷張多與外蒙交通者。畏中蘇兩國眞正成立諒解。聯合制日。共維公義也。今蘇聯忽急於近利。欲得出售中東路些微利益。而失去中國民族之好感。又復換取和平不得。徒喪蘇聯之令譽。竊爲蘇聯不取者一也。</p>
<p>第二·李維諾夫氏謂我國不能在東北實際行使權力。在變相的戰爭時期。亦屬常事。遠之如阿爾薩斯洛連終於歸回原主。近之如一九二○年日本出兵西比利亞扶助謝米洛夫。以反擊蘇俄。皆爲明證。現在我東北雖爲日本帝國主義所刦制。爲暴力所蹂躪。但終必有最後清算物歸原主。之一日。則蘇聯又何必急急於此時。强自單獨爲不合法之處置。致中蘇親善之國交。種一絕大惡因。竊爲蘇聯不取者二也。</p>
<p>第三·蘇聯固常兢兢自守。防備資本主義各國之進攻。并力圖維護其旣得勝利。苟能維持中東路。使日本有所顧忌。則資本主義各國亦精神分離。愈陷矛盾。若中東路一旦售諸日本。則日本侵華政策。收最大功效。封鎖蘇聯。更著成績。於是乎所謂大陸政策得以完成。西比利亞亦與我國北部同受威脅。是有損於蘇聯本身亦甚大。竊爲蘇聯不取者三也。</p>
<p>第四·日本在國際外交。自前年十三票對一票。與夫本年二月四十二票對一票之國際裁决後。其外交已陷於孤立。蘇聯且成爲左右世界之絕大偉力矣。今一旦蔽於日本威嚇之詞。竟自行提議出售中東路。於是日本最初進攻我國時所揚言防止「赤化」之謊言奏功。英日且重新諒解。英美亦暫時協力。對蘇戰線乃愈緊密。封鎖蘇聯。亦愈易實現。是則日本雖孤立而不孤。蘇聯縱多友而喪友。竊爲蘇聯不取者四也。</p>
<p>有此四端。利害得失。明如觀火。且爲中蘇兩國國交將來之障碍。是以深望蘇聯切實體認。勿惑於當前短時期之利得。而忘將來無窮之後患也。</p>

<h3>灤東古北各路戰事激烈</h3>
<p>北平特訊、日軍甘冒天下不韙、大舉侵入關内、謀佔平津、完成其華北國陰謀、日來積極進犯、侵入灤東之軍隊、圖渡灤河西犯、同時長城各口亦增調大軍、於今日（十一）向我總攻、其殘暴之飛機、則更任意在我無戰備之戰區以外各城市、亂擲重量烈性炸彈、不顧人道、殘害無辜平民、今晨（十一）且有飛機到平偵察、散放荒謬絕倫之煽動傅單、以爲進犯平津之先導、其絕大野心、至此可謂完全暴露、而其欺朦世界之假面具、殆亦全部揭穿矣、茲將各方情况、分誌如左、</p>
<h3>各路進犯戰况</h3>
<p>灤東日軍向我總攻以後、分路進犯我撫寗·遷安·盧龍·昌黎·各地、我軍在灤東僅駐少數部隊、藉維地方治安與鐵路交通、初無大軍扼守、日軍相繼陷撫寗·遷安·盧龍·以後、圖攻昌黎、更謀渡河西進、我軍按預定計劃、陸續集中灤河西岸原陣地、隔河拒守、灤河以東僅留少數騎兵、以資警戒、昨日侵入盧龍之日僞軍、一面向我灤東岸之翁師壓迫、一面側襲昌黎、我昌黎騎兵、被敵包圍、後經奮勇抗戰、始行突圍、昨晚昌黎以西安山鎭、已發現敵兵、安山車站亦受砲擊、我軍爲顧慮側背、鞏固陣線起見、警戒部隊及鐵甲車、均退灤河東岸石門車站、今日日軍仍沿平榆大道西進、我北寗線上騎兵、尙在與敵抗戰中、必要時、即行撤過灤河橋、以便憑河固守、灤河上流敵軍、刻正準備由遷安·盧龍·西進、渡過灤河、昨有一部日步兵、在猛烈砲火掩護之下、希圖渡河、當被我軍擊退、我灤西各部、已切實聯絡、防堵敵軍西犯、今晨石門附近·及遷安·盧龍·河岸、均在激戰中、日軍此次侵入灤東部隊、除僞軍外、計有三個旅團、昨日又由大連運送兩旅團到秦皇島、該兩旅團乃由本國新調來華之生力軍、奉山路上、兵車絡繹、運輸軍用品甚忙、窺其情勢、非大舉渡河西犯、進擾平津不止也、北古口方面、敵近增一旅團、於前日起、開始活動、今日（十一）已向我總攻、昨晚南天門之敵、向我猛烈砲擊、下午七時、步兵兩營、攻我稻黄村·湧泉莊·等處陣地、激戰三小時、敵死傷甚衆、向南天門潰退、湧泉莊被敵用燒夷彈轟擊、以致起火延燒、旋經撲滅、車頭峪方面、昨日下午六時、亦有步兵四五百名、前來攻擊、當被我某師擊退、今晨（十一）敵向我新開嶺·稻黄村·上店子·車頭峪·等處陣地、全線總攻、戰事異常激烈、至發稿時、尙在激戰中、喜峰口·羅文峪·興隆鎭·一帶、敵近增加軍隊甚衆、準備總攻、今晨羅文峪面方、已有激戰、其他各處戰事亦將爆發、日軍對於古北喜峰各路、頗爲重視、擬由此路抄襲平津、威脅我全部戰線、以謀達到其戰略上之捷進目的、</p>

<h3>察哈爾戰事的一篇總賬（一續）（報特派員國安）</h3>
<p>（三）一週的戰况</p>
<p>事實證明了、劉逆桂堂等、肩着日本帝國主義的旗子、佔領了多倫、緊接着由熱西的大平原上、活動着檄調了軍隊和軍械的用品、不用說敵人這種緊張的舉動、總攻沽源的命令、也就快下了、但是表面上雖然這様的緊張、而其實在還不過是千餘的日兵、驅着那些喪心病狂的亡省奴的大同胞們、萬餘人在前作衝鋒隊、同時在這一週裏敵人的舉動、好像烟幕彈和照明彈、是混合着放的似的、雖然敵人在察省境内、是如何的玩着那套呌人莫測的戲法、但我們總能夠斷定的是日軍决不能用大部隊、目前在察綏境内横行的、最大限是在僞軍裏面、附屬些重火器、和坦克車飛機等類的利器而已、攻擊的主力部隊、無論如何、在這裏是僞軍担任着、很明顯的在那沙漠似的原野上、給養和飲料、都很缺乏、並且日軍的目標、暫時對於察綏、還没有積極攻佔的企圖、所以很狡猾的驅着那没心肝的叛逆、幹去吧、誰還管牠們的死活呢、</p>
<p>敵人攻察的第一步計劃、佔多倫已經完成了、按着目前的形勢、攻沽源的主力部隊、說什麽也是由張多大道前進的、牠决不會避開張多大道、向西挺進、因爲現在還不需要那種深入遠攻的策略、並且由豐寗向獨石口·赤城·一帶、作内綫的攻擊、暫時也不會有的、因爲那芝山嶺地帶、孫軍在那裏防守、假設放棄由多倫攻沽源的計劃、施行内線圜攻、很明顯的又得成了相持不下的僵局、除非攻沽源的部隊得了手脚、那麽内綫攻堅的計劃、是要開始了、不但威脅我軍守沽源的部隊、還能給張家口的右後方、一個重大的打擊、但由多張大道向南推進、而敵人的右翼、也必定用雜亂的騎隊威脅、使我軍退至最後的防綫、只是在這一週裏、敵人的攻擊、還没有十分準備完畢呢、</p>
<p>自從敵人進入多倫、僞逆軍的行動完全和土匪一様、有的地方還要比土匪厲害、所以日軍對於這些大逆無道的傢伙、也有點感覺到指揮的困難、所以一方面在整理逆軍的統系、一方面又在調動補充、雖然電報上那様宣傅、逆軍的挺進攻擊隊、在我軍陣地前面如何示威遊擊着、這種動作、完全是恐怕我軍的反攻、那知道在前線的那些我們的守軍將士們、就……………………………、</p>
<p>多倫失守一直到現在止、沽源前方、都是平靜的、　我們集結在沽多張北一帶的軍隊、不下五萬人、步騎砲兵都很完全、所以敵人雖然認爲由沽源正面攻擊、是攻擊我軍的弱點、但是也不能不加以愼重、何况目前灤東的大戰、又有重行爆發的可能、這様一來、敵人攻察的企圖、恐怕又須停個三週兩週的、我軍現在所感到的困難、給養和運輸的器材、同時最大的弱點、就是指揮不統一、什麽様的軍隊都有、名義上大家團結一起、同舟共濟、事實上自己顧自己、打不好腿快的就先逃、跑慢的就算獨霉頭、熱河戰事一開始、不就是那個様子嗎、開魯退赤峯、降的降跑的跑、就是不跑的也被他瘊嚇跑了、最覺得担心的、是那義勇軍改編的軍隊、雖然他們苦戰了二年、對於作戰的經騐都有、但是子彈補充不足、一些訓練也没有、但我們雖是這様的担心、可是我們同時又敢相信、他們犧牲性是大的、（未完）</p>

<p>四川内戰又起</p>
<h3>廿四八兩軍在崇慶交鋒戰區蔓延事態逐漸擴大</h3>
<p>重慶通信、四川軍閥劉湘、劉文輝、因利害衝突、在國難嚴重時期、竟不顧一切、發動内戰、輾轉三月有餘、始行宣告結束、暫歸平靜、孰知廿四八兩軍、本月五日、竟又公然開始火併、廿九軍亦已捲入漩渦、事態逐漸擴大、朋波動全局之可能、目前黔戰方酣、而川戰又起、西南半壁、無一片淨土矣、茲將再度川戰爆發之原因、及最近戰爭情形、分别彙誌於次、</p>
<h3>川戰重行爆發遠因</h3>
<p>前次川戰、廿四軍劃文輝爲衆矢之的、爲各方所圍攻、但劉氏手腕甚爲靈活、有分化聯軍之力、而結果各方仍均未爲所動、僅廿八軍鄧錫侯與劉虚相委蛇、劉文輝爲挽該軍於垂危、解除重圍起見、曾唆使全軍將領擁鄧錫侯爲該軍總司令、指揮前綫軍事、與聯軍週旋、並允劃雙流·崇慶·等縣爲鄧防地、復助鄧軍欵五百萬、殊不知後來戰事吃緊、廿四軍前方危急、鄧錫侯竟將軍欵防地完全没收、按兵不動、待廿九軍田頌堯發難、成都發生巷戰時、鄧軍之黄逸民師等部、復潛入廿九軍部内、暗中助田軍攻打劉文輝、意欲將廿四軍消滅、根本解决、但劉文輝於萬分危急中、鼓動士氣、將廿九軍打敗、並將田頌堯逐出成都、此時鄧錫侯又出頭調停、雙方停戰講和、結果廿九軍各方部隊集中、從容反攻、重演省垣巷戰、而廿八軍部隊、不但不助劉文輝、或宣告中立、竟仍出兵圍攻廿四軍、當時廿四軍軍長劉文輝及全軍各將領、對鄧均銜恨入骨、惟以當時四面楚歌、未敢相較、隱忍待時、再興問罪之師、故留下再度川戰之禍根、</p>
<h3>參戰各軍主要隊伍</h3>
<p>此次川戰以廿四軍劉文輝爲戎首、劉軍自前次戰事後、防地雖損失過半、實力尙無大損、全軍改編後、共計十師、計第一師師長張致和、二師師長林雲根、三師師長夏首勛、四師師長唐永暉、五師師長王元虎、六師師長陳鴻文、七師師長冷南薰、八師師長青飛如、九師師長李玉書、十師師長陳能芬、一旅旅長賴牧天、二旅旅長康秋帆、三旅旅長黄鰲、四旅旅長黄啟賢、五旅旅長劉文彩、六旅旅長劉竹村、七旅旅長寇澄清、八旅旅長劉元塘、九旅旅長王治人、十旅旅長林梅坡、十一旅旅長楊尙周、十二旅旅長傅淵希、十三旅旅長徐光普、十四旅旅長張志芳、十五旅旅長余仲英、十六旅旅長彭誠孚、十七旅旅長余松琳、十八旅旅長趙佩三、十九旅旅長石肇武、二十旅旅長牟光明、廿一旅旅長程資民、廿二旅旅長黄錫煊、廿三旅旅長熊次侯、廿四旅旅長高㻙宗、廿五旅旅長蘇華洲、廿六旅旅長段克瑞、廿七旅旅長朱銀洲、廿八旅旅長楊宗禮、廿九旅旅長陳瑞庭、三十旅旅長牟遂芳、每師萬人、共有十萬之衆、防地計有華陽·崇慶·新津·雙流·卭州·蒲江·大邑·眉山·彭山·丹稜·青神·雅安·天全·名山·蘆山·榮經·漢源·曁興·嘉定·夾江·洪雅·健爲·雷波·馬邊·峩眉·西昌·冕寗·越雋·會理·鹽源·鹽邊·昭覺·連西康十四縣、共四十七縣、與廿四軍立於對敵地位之二十八軍鄧錫侯部、前次川戰、部隊毫無重大損失、且反增加人數、計共五師、第一師師長陳書農、第二師師長黄隱、第三師師長馬德齋、敎導師長楊榮白、模範師長陳靜珊、一旅旅長游廣居、二旅旅長王學姜、三旅旅長孫貢頌、四旅旅長王世俊、五旅旅長刁文俊、六旅旅長劉高槐、七旅旅長羅迺璠、八旅旅長周世英、九旅旅長劉乃鑄、十旅旅長謝德戡、十一旅旅長饒光裕、十二旅旅長李樹華、十三旅旅長龔渭清、十四旅旅長劉丹梧、十五旅旅長牛錫光、每師一萬二千人、共六萬人、防地有溫江·郫縣·崇寗·灌縣·新繁·廣漢·新都·金堂·松潘·理番·茂功·茂州·汶川·彭縣·連甘肅三縣、共十七縣、至在川西北一帶全力勦匪之廿九軍田頌堯、現因巴中·通江·南江·相繼收復、除辦理善後外、全軍已向成都集中、準備參加再度川戰、與廿八軍共敵廿四軍、</p>
<h3>再度川戰爆發近因</h3>
<p>廿四軍劉文輝、在前次川戰、旣受鄧錫侯之重大影響、無日不思報復、但又無題可借、乃前曾隸廿四軍劉文輝磨下之川康軍第三師師長陳書農、按月由劉接濟餉欵十六萬元、維持現狀、戰爭爆發、陳書農竟不受劉文輝之命令、按兵不動、且乘勢攫取地盤、並公然宣稱脫離廿四軍關係、歸還建制、仍受鄧錫侯指揮、劉文輝遂藉題發揮、令鄧賠還平素接濟陳書農之軍欵、並要陳將所住之簡陽·樂至·兩縣讓出、否則武力解决、鄧錫侯平素對各方、均能忍辱退讓、此次對劉之要求、獨認爲無理、嚴詞拒絕外、並積極從事軍事上之準備、廿四軍劉文輝方面、遂召集全軍將領會議、討論切實解决辦法、結果均主對鄧用兵、一决雌雄、於是本月五日、廿四軍第五師長王元虎部、與廿八軍第二師師長黄隱部、於崇慶縣境内石羊塲實行接獨、於是方歸沉靜之川局、又爲之擾動而發生重大變化、</p>
<h3>最近兩軍交戰情勢</h3>

<h3>模範監獄被控後董蔡二氏談話</h3>
<p>漕河涇江蘇第二模範監獄、規模甚大、現時收容之囚犯、總數在二千人以上、其中政治犯佔多數、近該監以辦事窳敗、招致在囚犯之不滿、日前有犯人王家祥·吕宗瑞·等、特爲此委請董康律師、將該監一切不法陋規、訴呈司法行政部、要求澈查改革、自董律師之訴請書、在報端發表後、極爲社會各方注意、新聲社記者、以茲事關係國家法制、曁人權保障、昨特走訪董綬經·蔡子民·二氏、承見告如左、</p>
<h3>董綬經談</h3>
<p>此次代表王吕等人之委託呈訴完全係由於彼等遭受過分不法之苛遇、且王吕等三數人之呼籲、亦可謂之爲代表全體囚人之呐喊也、近來時間關於監獄腐敗之傅言、故不久前、曾以個人地位、勸告司法行政部典獄司長王元增氏、請其注意澈查、最好能與囚犯共同生活一星期、始可明悉獄中眞實情况、王氏當時因已允諾、本人在光緒二十八九年時、曾充任典獄吏二年、深知我國監獄之黑暗、所謂牢頭皂吏之窮兇極惡、誠不勝述、故繼後執官司法界時、卽多方謀其改善、曾去日本歐美各國參觀監獄情形、一切較之我國、實不啻天壤、總之、此問題關係整個國家政治、政治不良、社會惡化犯法者固多執法者亦正同其比例、此皆非局部問題、前曾在蘇州見一典獄官、年齡幼稚、不知法律爲何物、而舉動豪華、莫出其右、後聞悉此人原係當時司法行政部長魏明君之親戚、至此、余始知今之爲官者、視獄吏爲肥缺、如是而欲求監獄改良、又安可得乎、然此尙不過其一端耳、此次該犯人之委託呈訴、余雖以職務關係受委、但所呈是否眞實、則需待當局之澈底調查、依余想像、其腐敗或更甚如呈文所叙、亦未可知、律師公會將組織監獄視察團是其職業上所應有之使命、又聞新聞界亦有人發起記者參觀團、余意不必過分鋪張、反使當局無從措置、漕河涇監獄典獄官、旣致函各報、謂請以事實爲公論依歸甚善、吾人靜待其眞相調查、并深望當局之有則改之、無則加勉可也、</p>

<p>關於公共租界工廠檢查權問題、市政府秘書長兪鴻鈞、前曾往訪工部局總裁費信惇氏商談、據兪秘書長語中央社記者、渠曾向費氏說明中國政府之態度、中國政府對於檢查工廠之主權、决不能放棄、設工部局方面竟不顧一切、施行檢查、則必爲輿論界所反對、而工部局必不能順利進行、但中國政府、仍希望工部局能協助進行、而以不妨碍中國主權爲原則、費氏對於渠之聲述、表示同情、並允於數日内、加以考慮、即行書面答復、據兪氏觀察、此事工部局或不致始終趨於極端、而可得一折衷辦法云、</p>

<p>購機待欵　航空協會方面、先訂購戰機十二架、自余前次晋京與軍政部陳次長接洽、對飛機種類配置、均已確定、即將訂購惟所需欵項、則本市已募得者尙嫌不足、上海徵求隊、在吳市長領導之下、努力進行、雖所得僅達預定目的之半、然吾人就捐欵人一分析之、即覺大部份均出於中下階級者、得此百萬、正非易易、以殷富之家所集中之上海、而富人反少捐輸、無怪所得不多也、今已展期一月、在此一月中、徵求隊决專注力於勸募富人、國勢日危、富人决非不知愛國者、稍節浪費、即已可觀、逆料本月中所得結果、必可超過二百萬也、</p>

<h3>國恥週演講沈體蘭先生講五三慘案</h3>
<p>五月十日在青年會講</p>
<p>剛纔主席說我五三慘案發生後曾到濟南去實地考察過，鄙人確曾去過一回；但是這却要使諸君失望的，我看到的只是表面的部分，例如日本兵在街上横衝直撞，肆無忌憚；我在濟南不能看到五三慘案的原因，情况，和搆成這慘案的國際關係；鄙人對於歷史又很少研究，今天不過在校務之餘化費一小時略把這慘案的前後情形想一想，來和諸君談談。</p>
<p>民國十五年秋，國民革命軍自廣州誓師北伐，不數月打到武漢，打到江西，十六年三月打到南京：這一時期軍事進展的迅速是很可驚異的。但是國民革命纔到南京，由於一部分軍隊排外舉動帝國主義借題激起示威的行動││就是造成寗案：後來寗漢分裂，南京政府舉行清共，使國民革命在北伐很順利的征程中受了一次挫折。同年四月，國民革命軍繼續從南京沿津浦路向北進發。當時的日本握有政權者是田中内閣，一個黷武主義的軍閥操縱下的内閣，他認爲國民革命軍的北伐是日本在華北的權益的一種掃蕩，便毅然决然的出兵從青島上了陸。南京政府爲避免衝突計，就按兵在徐州，停止北上。日本軍閥見無隙可乘，只得於九月中撤兵回去。到了十七年四月國民革命軍又繼續北伐，日本又出兵青島，且向西進攻濟南。國民革命軍和日軍接獨以後，没有兩天濟南便失去了。兩月以後我在濟南所看到的，只有日本的馬隊到處馳驅，日本兵任意闖入住屋或商店搜查，和禁止中國人三五人以上在一起走路：我所看到的濟南就是一塊在一個時期中做了亡國的土地，濟南的人民在一個時期中做了·」國奴。</p>
<p>十個月以後國民革命軍又北上佔領了天津北平，關外的張作霖要維護他在北方的勢力的緣故，入關來謀抵抗，但是後來退出關内忽被日本人在皇姑屯炸死了。這種炸死中國軍閥的行動，也是顯示日本對於中國舊式軍閥的不滿足，他要尋一個機會來另找一個合式的傀儡工具。</p>
<p>這時候得到一個局部的統一。到年底張學良和關内互通了消息，非正式接受國民革命的努力向關外發展：第二年的六月又正式成立遼寗的省政省，接受三民主義和懇掛青天白日旗，至此中國纔告統一。</p>
<p>濟南日本兵經交涉以後而撤去，也在第二年四月。聽說是有條件的撤兵，一般的人們自然不管日本怎麽會撤兵的。</p>
<p>這是五三慘案前前後後的情形。</p>
<p>我們認爲紀念一個慘痛的國恥不在事實本身的回憶，而在着重夫攻察慘案的原因，意義和他所發生的關係。我們認爲這様纔能夠加重紀念的意義，也只有這様纔能夠。認清往後的路，和明白自己的責任。</p>
<p>現在我分四部分來說：</p>
<p>一，五三慘案和日本的内政</p>
<p>日本是一個新興的帝國主義的國家，他們國内軍閥的封建意識是很濃厚的，他們的勢力往往超過了政府，他們固然是主張侵略中國的；另一方面，日本又是一個新興的資本主義的國家，國内資本階級丨丨財閥的勢力也和軍閥的相等，他們也是主張侵略中國的。可是這兩派在目的上雖然同是侵略中國的，而方法上却不相同。軍閥主張用武力來侵略，誇耀他黷武的軍國主義的威風；而財閥主張用經濟來侵略，使中國在不知不覺受到他的壓榨。財閥這様主張，看到當時的列强對於中國革命的表面的妥洽，以爲只有繁榮中國纔匪够侵略中國，這條矛盾的定律是對的，很能夠在自己的國中講一些話。但是軍閥以爲經濟的侵略欠痛快，一方利用國内失業人數的衆多，和小資產階級的要求，就以開發遠東擴佔殖民地做號召，進行他黷武的軍國主義的夢。五三這一炮，就是暴露日本帝國主義内部衝突的開始！和軍閥勢力的抬頭？</p>
<p>一年以後日本兵從濟南撤去，日本的多數民衆和資產階級看到武力侵略的效果也不遇如此，就很多對於軍閥的非難。日本軍閥本想要利用中國軍閥的内戰以得到利益，可是中國的統一已經成爲普遍的要求，他要利用也終于不可能；他炸死張作霖以後，反促成張學良和國内的合作：這使得日本的多數民衆和少數財閥對於田中的仇恨。這一年田中便自盡了，以後幾年内濱口犬養毅等政府領袖先後被剌，甚至去年虹口公園的炸彈案，中間蛛絲馬跡很可注意的。</p>
<p>今日日本國中政治的動蕩，左傾思想的勃發，無產者和知識階級對於現政府的日益表示不滿，以及暗殺事件的增加，恐怕就是五三的一炮起其端罷？　　（未完）</p>

<h3>鍾勇森表演動人中華再保住中葡杯</h3>
<p>昨日比賽結果三對二勝</p>
<p>上半時葡隊一對零占先下半時中華三對一反勝</p>
<p>中葡杯國際足球賽、始於一九二五年、中華隊首唱凱旋歌、保住該盃、翌年中葡各勝一次、决賽以事停頓、遂成懸案、中間歷以事故、不克舉行者數年、至本屆、兩國足球界領袖、重提舊事、一度中斷之中葡盃、又得復活、本屆第一次中華七對二勝利、昨日兩國第二次會師棒球塲、中華再以三對二告捷、中葡盃遂又歸中華保住一年、</p>
<p>▲鍾勇森功冠全隊</p>
<p>昨日中華之勝、固在全隊同共努力之結果、然而鍾勇森之戰功、尤超越一切、鍾氏智勇兼全、傅擊悉精、三球之獲、直接間接、咸賴其力、陸鍾恩手脚乾凈、高低並顧、馮運佑李寗舊侣重圓、自屬可觀、陳鎭和老練、屠開元奮勇、梁樹棠驃悍、中衛線實力、堪與敵比、惜乎合作、尙欠純熟、中部三將一時之選、然未盡其全力、不失之莽、卽近於滑、精彩表演、清爽脚頭、實不多見也、萬象華幾度挑送、値得贊許、</p>
<p>▲谷司坦誠是可兒</p>
<p>葡隊球員、剛柔兼能、確係中華勁敵、全隊分散各處、無聯絡之可能、不料一旦成軍、竟然聲色俱厲、中堅谷司坦身居要職、時領三軍將士、分頭進展、或與内部大員、扼守要隘、葡隊得能耀武揚威、此君實握樞紐、郎哥爾身手矯捷、足與日柯拉沙並稱、馬賽爾未穿球鞋、不免遜色、全隊上半時於逆風中、甚多佳作、下半時反較不如、大致長力不足耳、</p>

<p>▲陸鍾恩三救阿斗</p>
<p>三時旣屆、球迷尙源源而來、若决江河之水、何春輝捧球出塲、銀笛一聲、葡隊逆風開球、柯拉沙撥與郎哥爾、馮運佑半渡邀擊、萬氏反攻不遂、谷司坦一脚長傅、西那西郊放馬、屠博士阻擋不得、球已傅中、柯拉沙在罰球線上、對門力射、陸鍾恩不慌不忙、伸手接住、方才送出、雷米迪又入重圍、Ｓ那脫搶進數武、得隙攻門、陸鍾恩再度救出、西那又來、陸氏早月準備、順手接得、</p>
<p>▲孫錦順報國心切</p>
<p>中華久處於重重壓迫之下、久思有所舉動、俄而梁樹棠獲得一球、就近派與萬氏、盤進兩丈、轉交孫錦順、待谷司坦來搶、球又躥入東垓、鍾勇森如火如荼、連陷三道防線、江山兒無招架、祇得逼成角球、鍾氏開來、恰如初寫黄庭、克羅司手慌脚亂、再拍角球、萬氏主踼、亦見佳妙、屠博士出脚過力、致送向雲霄、無何、華方旗幟又在葡隊後防飛舞、李義臣爲谷司坦所窘、急派與孫氏、已距門相去不十碼、孫鐵腿舉起鐵腿、猛力射掃、惜高門五寸、輕輕越去、觀衆莫不嘆惜欲死、</p>
<p>▲郎哥爾先建功績</p>
<p>此後中華後衛、災患頻呈、驚險時見、Ｂ龔山夫驃悍非常、得縫卽鑽、馮運佑稍一失神、彼卽孤軍深入、李寗急引軍來援、彼乃發脚射門、陸氏眼明脚快、救出重圍、中華起師反攻、遇阻折回、柯拉沙聲勢浩大、又臨禁地、陸鍾恩勤愼異常、見球卽拾、絕無差誤、萬氏得角球機會、爲Ａ柯拉沙背部彈出、萬氏猶不甘心、再來進犯、鍾勇森性急腿快、越位作罷、葡隊趁中華内防空虚、柯拉沙帶兵深入、郎哥爾得球、闖入罰球區域、李馮二將、回師不及、郎氏遂以迅雷不及掩耳之脚頭、對門低射、陸鍾恩措手不及、紀錄遂開、</p>
<p>▲李義臣適逢其會</p>
<p>中華隊數度進攻、李義臣失之於前、孫錦順誤之於後、屠博士一脚遠射、力道十足、祇惜稍高一尺、而上半時大好光陰、於焉逝去、休息未旋踵、戰馬又嗚、中華位北、逆風迎日、形勢極爲不利、觀衆至此、亦僉謂中華此次難逃毒手、庸知開球之後、聲勢反較上半時爲盛、三傅兩遞、鍾氏已入重防、遇阻於内衛、急遠交萬氏、萬氏舉足反挑、李義臣適在門旁、以頭頂入、</p>
<p>▲三對二中華成功</p>
<p>秋色平分之後、華隊氣燄更甚、鍾勇森爲後進奇材、殺法極爲厲害、時出時入、如在無人之境、勇悍如谷司坦以及老雄麥賽爾、亦皆奈何他不得、某一時期、鍾氏被撞受傷、出塲未久、又自裏創助戰、華隊前鋒、增加勇氣不少、不轉瞬間、鍾氏氣呑山岳、孤軍陷陣、僻易萬人、帶球直入、搗進龍門、反以二對一佔先、博得采聲灌耳、中華反敗爲勝、進攻不已、葡人亦不甘宰割、得隙卽施報復、故中華後防、未見鞏固、風大球急、陳鎭和阻之失效、Ｂ龔山夫先人一步、近門十五碼、砰然一脚、再成和局、戰局至此、空氣又見緊張、鍾勇森邊關起義、其快如飛、下那脫馬失前蹄、麥賽爾很命來追、鍾氏眼底無人、直至罰球線、急挑送至門前、李義臣一射不得、萬氏脚上擺渡、鍾將軍捲土重來、横身一掃、球竟入門、四座歡呼若狂、葡人雖努力反攻、無奈時間不許、鐵笛一聲、我中華遂泰然獲得錦標歸矣、</p>

<p>江大運動會第二日</p>
<h3>今日起全能運動田徑錦標解决</h3>
<p>田賽錦標屬中央得卅六分</p>
<p>徑賽錦標屬光華得卅五分</p>
<p>女子百米胡瑞聲平等全國紀錄</p>
<p>兩日間造成大會新紀錄共十種</p>
<p>江大第六屆田徑運動會、已於昨日結束、今日起爲全能運動、而女子田徑、則於今日結束、中央大學以三十六分獲得錦標、徑賽錦標、中央與光華、始終分數相等、形勢緊張、直至最後一項八百米决賽、光華以二分佔優、榮獲冠軍、得分三十五、中央三十三、男女成績、造成大會新紀錄者共九項、胡瑞聲女士、並以十三秒四、平等孫桂雲之百米全國紀錄、難能可貴、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>會塲一瞥</h3>
<p>昨日風勢愈大、呢帽草帽、吹得滿塲飛滾、競賽愈覺吃苦、祇因節止俱屬决賽、田賽徑賽兩錦標、均待解决、故觀衆較第一日倍增、女性亦佔不少、光華與中央之徑賽競爭、殊爲劇烈、結果光華卒以三十五比三十二分獲取冠軍、光華同學、興高采烈、歡呼不絕、中央大學、以田賽及女子運動優勝、其歡呼之聲、不時與光華戰鬥、同爲會塲生色不少、</p>
<h3>成敗管見</h3>
<p>▲光華徑賽人才出衆</p>
<p>▲中央缺少特出人才</p>
<p>▲大夏田賽美中不足</p>
<p>男子田徑錦標已解决、田賽歸中央、徑賽歸光華、爲光華得江大田徑賽錦標之第一次、田賽中中央之勝大夏、人才多而平均、爲最大原因、而大夏於撑竿跳三級跳二項、無一人才、安能有望、徑賽之中、八項光華得六項第一、難能可貴、中央之失敗、一言以蔽之、人才雖多無特出、故最後之八百米决勝負、惟有聽其自然之失敗、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>計劃</h3>
<p>— 適夷</p>
<p>自從蘇聯五年計劃得到了成效，計劃這個名詞就很流行，如胡佛二十年計劃，希特拉四年計劃等等，調子都唱得很好聽，不過前者旣以胡佛丢了總統飯碗而未觀厥成，希特拉剛剛開頭，除了排斥猶太人，搜捕共產黨以外，還未見有什麽大的作爲。在中國，世界上有的東西當然也不能不有，便有了某某部長的實業建設四年計劃。至於這計劃已否開始，在怎様的進行，恕我無從檢查也無權檢查，不敢遽下斷語。我要說的是另一種計劃。</p>
<p>這是最近報紙上的大標題告訴我的：</p>
<p>「灤東敵軍，節節進迫，我軍計劃西退。」恕我加一點註釋，這「計劃」兩字是作副詞形容詞用的，意即「有計劃地」，並非動詞的還在「計劃」中。本來，好久以前，我們就知道了，「我軍安然退出！」那様的消息。「退出」而能夠「安然」，這當然早有計劃了。</p>
<p>我没有讀過孫武子兵法之類的書，近代軍事學，更是十足的門外漢，祇記得小時候看三國誌演義，知道「實則虚之，虚則實之」是兵家常用的戰略；而「以退爲進，以守爲攻」，「誘敵深入，聚而殲之」那様的軍事常識，也曾經從戰事新聞上偶知一二。所以以爲有計劃的退出，目的當然是在反攻，何况新聞紀事上還有「前線殲敵甚多」等字様，這退出之並非戰敗，更可相信。因此一向就很樂觀，巴望總有一天會「收復失地」。</p>
<p>但是新看到了中委吳稚暉先生的談話，我的樂觀不禁大爲動搖，吳先生說，「我們祇希望三天可失的地，使它兩月方失。」丨這大槪就是「整個計劃」了。如果照這計劃，該「失」到幾時才能把全個中國「失」完，固然是不敢推算；就是想想那些在砲火底下肉搏血戰的士兵，他們的血肉代價，祇不過把「三天」換作「兩月」，已經是不知道怎様說才好了。</p>
<p>不過，一想到這是爲了要實現計劃，就祇得認爲滿意。</p>
<h3>訪問</h3>
<p>— 樓金聲</p>
<p>在暖和的日光下走着好一會，到了新近亡故的朋友如的妻的家裏。　　我呷着玻璃杯裏的綠茶，望着坐在對面的亡友的妻說着話。她是一個愛動愛說話的女子。今天穿着一件洗舊的不相稱的愛國布衫子，因爲天熱，面容很煥發。如是去年才亡故的，我和如的妻三四個月不見，我想，她什麽都没有變，依然活潑的笑着，說着，使人覺得兩様的，祇是穿了一件比從前樸素的布衣罷了。</p>
<p>如與玉進行戀愛的時候，自己也曾帮過他們的忙；在他們進行這事的時候，自己還開玩笑似的對如說過：「我有時也很愛玉呢，因而使得如不高興過。現在對着面前的少婦，這穿着洗舊的不相稱的愛國布衫子的女人，想起她已是「孀」婦，一些不安分的念頭便自然起來了。但是再想起死去的朋友，那並不泛泛的友誼，心裏便又浮上一些愧悔，趕忙尋出一句不相干的話來掩飾自己的踧踖：</p>
<p>「你曉得劉毓貞，現在怎様了嗎？」</p>
<p>「不知道……，我現在一個人都不通信，曉得如死的人讓他們曉得，不曉得的我也不寫信給他們」。</p>
<p>劉毓貞是如玉進行戀愛時，常在一起的朋友，而現在　已結婚生子了的女子。玉說到她現在一個人都不通信的時候，本來露着笑容的臉上，斗的顯出沉重的陰影，語音也變硬了，接着，我看見她那雙眼中淌下兩行清淚。</p>
<p>「怎麽？你這樣灰心？」</p>
<p>我覺着我過於笨拙了，說了這様的話。我懊悔，不該獨着她的創痛，自己又太年輕，不便給她一些溫柔的安慰，就祇好抱着歉意，悄然坐着。幸而這沉默的時間没有延續多久，她已換了一付愉快的臉色。她是不願意把自己的傷痛給人曉得的。我知道。</p>
<p>紛雜的思绪使我不能在這裏再停下去。我祇說了聲：「以後有功夫再來看你」，便辭了出來。但一路上，那滿懷惆悵的心情，眞是没人知道的！</p>
<h3>丹田以下</h3>
<p>— 劍光</p>
<p>曹聚仁先生說：得道之士，導引採補，歸於丹田。其法巧而時日遲緩。譬如：民國十二三年的狐狸，在北京修道。直到今年，方才鷄犬皆仙，曠時十年，未免太久。以余所知，摩登修道士，自有電氣培養法，不歸於「丹田」而歸於「丹田」以下。</p>
<p>「丹田」以下的修鍊，有房中術，又有素女經。黄帝御七七四十九女而得道升仙，「丹田」以下之妙處更不可言。葉德輝先生若聽見我的說法，必在地下大笑曰：「吾道不孤」！</p>
<p>以例明之，楊太眞外傅載：「天寳四載七月，册楊氏爲貴妃，贈其父玄琰濟陰太守，母李氏隴西部郡夫人，從兄釗拜爲侍郎。七載，加釗御史大夫，權京兆尹，賜名國忠。封大姨爲韓國夫人，三姨爲虢國夫人。八姨爲秦國夫人；同日拜命，皆月給錢十萬，爲脂粉之資。」由丹田以下而鷄犬皆仙者，我國精神文明之結晶，修道之另一秘訣也。曹聚仁先生思想守舊，僅見「丹田」之有妙用；而不知「丹田以下」之妙用，自古有之，於今爲烈，非表章不可也！</p>
<p>大觀園中有一人物，與賈府全無爪葛，以修鍊「丹田」之故，來居大觀園中。曹雪芹先生的夾縫中文章，彷彿告訴我們：她之所以得賈府歡心，還在「丹田以下」。其人爲妙玉，大家該尊重她罷！</p>
<p>唐人謠云：「生女勿悲酸，生男勿喜歡！」可爲今日詠也！</p>
<h3>阿毛</h3>
<p>— 朱迅沅</p>
<p>冷風從門縫中滲進來，豆似的燈光便飄搖不定。四周都靜悄悄的，阿毛在對着燈光發呆，在凝想着自己的命運。</p>
<p>阿毛，村中的人都知道他是個勤儉人，不賭錢，也不吃烟。但近年來不知是交了什麽運，非但把祖上傅下來的幾畝田都賣掉；並且還虧了一身的債。</p>
<p>前年水大，阿毛的田地都被水淹没。半年辛苦的結果只撈着幾顆水稻。換得的錢，還不夠還城裏王老爺的租米。于是他不得不去向鎭上的顧太爺借幾十塊錢。經了幾次的苦求，他總算借得了五十塊錢。言明月息二分五厘；這二分五厘的月息，還是顧太爺見他可憐，發善心答應他的。</p>
<p>去年秋天，天眞好，稻長得又綠又高。阿毛吃過了晚飯，每天總要到田横頭去走一遭，看看豐實的稻穗，一種莫名的喜悅便從心頭溜出來。心裏都發笑。稻在晚風中輕曳，也像在和着他笑。夜間躺在床上，骨骼中雖說覺得有些酸溜溜，但是金色的希望，使他忘記了一天的辛苦。</p>
<p>稻上塲了，米價跌了，阿毛的希望打破了。</p>
<p>阿毛把所有的米都糶去，一共得了一百多塊錢。還了顧太爺的債，付了一半欠的荳餅錢，還有兩隻老洋躱在阿毛的衣袋裏，幾升糙米堆在家裏的米桶裏。</p>
<p>十月初十，城裏王老爺開棧了。隔璧阿水金已凑了幾十塊錢去還了，還有張家伯伯和李根保也上城去還了，其餘村中的人都拖着，阿毛當然也是其中之一。</p>
<p>三限（註一）過了，大叔，（註二）已來催過一次，臨走時還再三說，下次不繳，就要請他們到城裏去吃官司。</p>
<p>阿毛餓着肚子，奔走借錢。跑了一日，半個錢也没有借到，人家都說「時世枯」。</p>
<p>阿毛想盡了方法，最後一法只有逃。這就是他今夜在苦思的事情。他們决定逃往北灣裏母舅家去。</p>
<p>次日清晨，他們就出發了。阿毛走後，於是他家裏的門窗用具和堆着的柴都給大叔掮去了。</p>

<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Ｊｕｌｅｓ　Ｒｅｎａｒｄ林取譯</p>
<p>開水壺（續）</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨我瞧着這從壁爐上一滴一滴流下來的一灘泥水，奥洛林。這才髒得好看啦。奥洛林丨爲什麽人家不通知我便把我的開水壺偷去呢？這也許就是你把它拿去了的罷？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨這開水壺是這裏一家人的，奥洛林。我或雷辟克先生，或我的孩子們，偶然要用它時，難道還得請求你的允許嗎？</p>
<p>奥洛林丨我生氣得利害的時候，就會說出一些蠢話來的。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你對我們生氣呢，還是對你自己生氣呢，奥洛林？是啦，你究竟對誰生氣呢？雖然並不好奇，我却狠想知道個清楚呢。你眞弄得我没有辦法了。你借口開水壺不見了，毫不躊躇的把一桶水倒在火上，非但不肯承認自己的過錯，還要怪到别人身上，甚至怪到我身上。我覺得我的話一點都没說錯啦！</p>
<p>奥洛林丨紅蘿蔔鬚，我的乖乖，你曉得我的開水壺在什麽地方嗎？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨他怎麽會知道呢？他，一個毫不管事的小孩子。再不要提起你的開水壺罷。我看你最好還是想想你昨天說過的話：「一旦我自己發見連燒一壺開水都不會了的時候，我自己便會卽刻滾蛋，不用别人來推我。」不錯，我覺得你的眼睛有毛病，可是我没有料到便到了絕望的境地。我再不說别的話了，奥洛林，祇請你替我設身處地想一想。現在的情形，你同我一様懂得清清楚楚的；請你仔細想一想，下個結論罷。啊！請你不用顧忌什麽，儘量地哭罷。這倒値得一哭呢。</p>
<p>没有說完的話</p>
<p>「媽媽！奥洛林！」</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>他還想說什麽呢，紅蘿蔔鬚？他會把所有的事情弄糟的。幸而在雷辟克家的嚴冷的眼色下，他突然停住了。</p>
<p>爲什麽要對奥洛林說：</p>
<p>「是我拿去的，奥洛林！」</p>
<p>没有什麽能够援救這老女人的。她的眼睛看不清楚了，她的眼睛看不清楚了。管她許多呢。她遲早會要讓步的。紅蘿蔔鬚的告白不過使得她更加難過罷了。還是讓她走罷，還是讓她一點出不疑心紅蘿蔔鬚，而祇以爲自己是受了不可避免的命運的打擊的好罷。</p>
<p>並且爲什麽要對雷辟克家的說：</p>
<p>「媽媽，是我拿去的！」</p>
<p>自己雖做了一宗値得稱賞的事又何必表功呢？何必定要乞求一個嘉獎的微笑呢？這事不但没有什麽好處，並且還有危險的，因爲他知道雷辟克家的會當衆責駡他的，那末還是帮助她到底罷，更好的辦法，還是假裝帮助他母親和奥洛林尋找開水壺罷。</p>
<p>當三個人合力尋找開水壺的當兒，顯得最熱心的是他。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的好像事不關己似的，第一個放下不管了。</p>
<p>奥洛林忍耐着跑開了，嘴裏喃喃的念着。因爲謹愼的緣故，差一點僨事了的紅蘿蔔鬚，一會兒也自己收鞘了，好像已經用不着了的刑具一樣。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>小說與左傅</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>有人問我怎様作小說。我案恰疊着一部春秋左傅，笑說道：「這便是小說的百科全書，讀一部春秋左傅，勝讀一百部名家小說。」</p>
<p>人家疑我戲言，我却一本正經的指出左列的許多證據：</p>
<p>左傅詳於行軍戰略，是軍事小說。詳於社會缺點，是社會小說。而且，這位盲目先生左邱明，最富於寫情之筆；巫臣挾婦，徐妹相夫，是艷情小說。哀姜過市，哭而呼天，是哀情小說。季芉辭嫁，鍾建負我，是俠情小說。二子投河，施婦立誓，是苦情小說。新臺生謗，艾貑興歌，是醜情小說。仲子手文，燕姞蘭徵，是奇情小說。</p>
<p>再者，楚幕有烏，桑中有喜，是偵探小說。葛盧知牛語，師矌識南風，是科學小說。鄭僑論魂魄，晏子别和同，是哲理小說。頴考叔遺羹，晉靈辄念母，是倫理小說。石言於晉國，蛇鬭於鄭門，是神怪小說。侏儒敗於邾，于恩棄甲來，是幽默小說。其他，其他，說不盡的其他，恕我不說了。</p>
<p>這是我替春秋左傅編回目，也是我替春秋左傅作廣告；一般少年都喜讀小說而不喜讀春秋左傅，以爲春秋左傅是沈悶的；其實，何嘗沈悶？春秋左傅是一部兼容並包的好小說。</p>
<p>我把這篇文字寫在「春秋」欄内，正所以引起讀者對於春秋左傅的興味。</p>
<h3>大道會</h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>贛閩邊境，近兩年來，因受方邵股匪之蹂躪，人民處於水深火熱之中，所謂唸咒吃符，足以抵制槍彈之大道會，便應運而出。此會聲勢不大，遠地人士，尙有不知，爰爲介紹，亦姑妄言之之意耳。</p>
<p>據贛屬上饒人來談：該會領袖以唸咒吃符，足以抵制槍彈相號召，在上饒鐵山地方有一分會，最初僅有一二十人，旋因該會試演道法，確有可以使人相深之處。於是繼續請求加入者紛紛不絕，遂成爲一個抗工團體，在最初加入爲會員時，須收若干會金，再授道法·每與小股土匪鏖戰時，先使各會員唸咒畫符飲下，另以一符貼於腹壁，所持武器，純係大刀戈矛等類，故鄕人又誤稱曰大刀會。</p>
<p>該會人員，因信子彈不足爲我害，凡有共匪來犯時，均各爭先迎敵，每次均獲勝利，以是鄕人益稱信不置，最近，該會在上饒花廳地方與某股匪激戰，竟繳獲步槍二十餘桿，子彈數箱，上饒縣長郭觫聞之，乃加賞步槍二十桿，謂該會雖亦近迷信，但能繳得槍械，其勇敢亦堪嘉許云。</p>
<p>該會無論是否以魔法惑人，但能利用迷信心理，激勵民衆，以與共匪相抗衡，自非苗猺以「興苗滅漢」相號召者可比，故樂爲介紹之。</p>
<h3>靈谷寺印象記</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>金陵諸山，一般地說來，多雄壯而不清秀，巉峭而不幽邃；童童濯濯，給人以不十分好的印象。但是靈谷寺的風景却不能不算例外。這一塊地方，距中山陵不過一二里，也正在鍾山東麓，箐深林密，曲徑通幽。遠望着一座古廟在千峯挿天之下，萬松成濤之中，便髣髴一幅天然的山水畫圖；氣象萬千，悠然虚寂，令人不禁爲之神往！</p>
<p>現在，加以是春去夏來，一個人置身在這種不可多得的環境中，不僅眼界爲之一新，而且嗅着一陣陣野草閒花的清香，更會使胸襟爲之一輰丨雖然陵谷寺裏面的牡丹芍藥並不多，但是轟動了首都人士，星期假日莫不乘陵園遊覽專車，風馳電掣的去遊靈谷寺；使夫子廟，玄武湖都爲之減色丨</p>
<p>這陵谷寺，有人以上海的龍華相比擬，也有人說和鎭江的招隱寺差不多。但我却以爲只有杭州西湖濱上的理安寺可以作比。至於有名的靈隱寺，也許還要較遜一籌呢！</p>
<p>寺後有寳公塔，據說是誌公藏骨的所在地。現在正完全翻造改建，巍巍浮屠九級，將成爲江南最高大的鋼骨水泥石塔；工程進行已歷兩年，大致已很有可觀。</p>
<p>傅說那裏有一塊石碑，碑上繪有誌公像，係吳道子的手筆，又有李太白作的贊，；顏魯公親筆書題；合稱爲「三絕碑」。最近，我們許多人去訪問時，却總不曾看見。不知落到什麽地方去了？</p>
<h3>我倒想學獸醫</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>獸醫是個官名。周禮天官之屬，掌療獸病獸瘍。現在各國都有獸醫專科；像上海職業指導所附設的獸醫學校就是。但在人家文明進步科學發達的國度，不但使它們民族身心健康，而且促進獸類的健康；我們中華呢？前年陜西虎列拉，鼠疫大流行；其他更不要說起。</p>
<p>農村充滿了病鷄，病狗，病猪，病牛，病羊，和害羣之馬；近來我倒想學獸醫；倘使學成一個獸醫專家，回農村去着實醫治一番；使它們改變獸心，成爲有信用的，有忠節的，供賚盛的東西與有功有牛大哥，上帝的羔羊。</p>
<p>倘使（又是一個倘使）我這個目的達到，便進一步學一個獵人；並不希望逐鹿中原；却想打掉高空至驚的鷹，隼與毒梟，横行山野的豺，狼，狐狸，與羣鼠。</p>
<h3>學丸</h3>
<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>自從中小學生畢業須輕會考之辦法規定後，坊間便產生了「會考必讀」。會考不僅考最後一學期的功課，各階段的全部功課都須考騐，這在學子們確認爲是一難關，而「會考必讀」自爲他們所歡迎了。數年中所讀的種種課本，都可束之高閣，祇須把一部簡略又簡略的「會考必讀」，日夕加緊臨時抱佛脚功夫，便可大膽地去應試。</p>
<p>有人說：簡略的會考書雖較繁複的課本易讀易記，但究竟還須讀，還須記。最好我們的科學家能發明一種學丸，採取黨義的精華，製成黨義丸。採取國文的精華，製成國文丸。其他算學史地化學物理外國文等等，亦皆製成各科學丸。你要明瞭黨義，祇須購取黨義丸一粒，用開水冲服，便成黨義專家。要明瞭國算英各科也照這様就得了。這不是一個無須讀與記的最科學的方法嗎？而學子們對於這發明學丸者，定將買絲繡其像，並把這像供在我中山先生遺像的上位了。</p>
<p>那人又說：這學丸又可分各科的混合的兩種。無論各科與混合，又可分小學中學大學三級的三種。各科學丸價錢略小。混合學丸係採取各科精英混合煉成的，吃此一丸，便各科皆明，一人萬能，所以價錢不妨賣得大，大中小三級的三種，價錢也自有高低。</p>
<p>我希望這學丸在最短期間能促其實現，因爲對人功德無量，對已利益無窮，而在世界發明史上，我之一頁今雖無人注意，但從此則將爲最重要之一頁矣。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第六回　甜苦情場冷觀評兩面　崎嶇世路密約訂三年</p>
<p>桂枝不知不覺的將一碗藕粉吃完了。心想，再不說話，機會又過去了，這才嘻嘻的向着積之一笑。積之看到人家笑，也就跟着一笑。桂枝道：你笑什麽？積之笑道：你笑什麽，我也就笑什麽呀。桂枝紅着臉，將果碟子裏一塊鷄蛋糕檢起來看了一看，可又依然放下。積之道：你要是想吃，你就吃罷，咱們還客氣什麽？桂枝搖搖頭道：什麽我也不想吃。我不是吃東西來的。積之笑道：你不是吃東西來的，爲什麽來的呢？說時，偏了頭向桂枝臉上望着。桂枝笑得將頭向手臂下藏了一藏，抬起來，正了顏色道：我有一句規規矩矩的話問你，你不能和哥哥分開來住嗎？積之一聽這句話，就知道另有一層深意，便道：我要是經濟能獨立了，當然可以和哥哥分開來住。我哥哥對我雖是很嚴厲，但是由讀書到現在，都是他一手携帶起來的，我不能不服從他。桂枝聽了這話，許久不能作聲，手上拿着舀藕粉的銅勺子，只管在空碗裏畫着。另一隻手，却托住了半偏着的頭。他雖不曾說什麽，看他那様子，知道他是充分的不高興。積之因向他笑道：你的意思怎麽様？桂枝撅了嘴道：我有什麽意思呢？他答着積之的話，眼睛可是向空碗裏望着積之道：你的意思，我也明白，對於你對我一分厚意，我是二十四分的感激。照說呢，我立刻就要和你結下盟約，一同合作。可是我現在手上一點積蓄没有，我們若是合作起來，一定會和我哥哥翻臉，我的差事，自然是要連帶的丢掉，那末，我將來怎麽辦呢？你若是相信我的話，請你等我三年。三年之中，我一定想出個辦法來。不過三年的日子，未免太長一點，我說這話，你不以爲是推諉嗎。（六九）</p>
<p>兒童的樂園</p>
<h3>小鳥的聰明</h3>
<p>有一天看見一隻小烏鴉，牠要吃瓶中的水，可是瓶水淺而它的嘴又短，總也吃不到。它立在瓶口邊，想來想去，想出一個方法來了。它在地啣了小石，投在瓶中，使瓶中的水逐漸昇高，那就吃得着了。小朋友們家中若是蓄養山雀，可以試騐籠中水瓶的水淺時，那山雀定能把籠内食物的砂殼，投在瓶中的。</p>
<h3>能直立的獸類</h3>
<p>大凡野獸類中，能像人的用後脚直立的，祇有熊類，因爲熊的後脚掌，完全與人相同的。猿類雖能直立，可是他的後脚掌，不能完全着地，所以不能像人一樣的行走。其他獸類，都靠脚指的力而立的。</p>
<h3>飛機的利用</h3>
<p>我們要知道現在飛機的利用，究竟有幾種呢？大槪在下列十四種可以包括。（一）軍用，（二）漁業，（探查魚羣所在地）（三）運輸特殊的貨物，（如鮮魚·新聞·書信·郵件）（四）探險，（五）看守山林，（六）搜查海洋遭難，（七）宣傅廣告，（八）測量（調查水源地·整理耕地敷設鐵道等）（九）救助生命（投放糧食品）（十）運輸旅客，（十一）農業（播散種子肥料殺虫剤）（十一）測量氣象，（十二）追尋犯人，（十）牧畜（家畜出栅時用飛機追逐）</p>
<h3>西洋婦人</h3>
<p>用白色布巾一條，可做一有趣的西洋婦人型，圖表說明如下。第一圖，先裂開布巾兩端，做好如圖様的兩根細棒。</p>
<p>第二圖，再在中間稍下的部分，打一結，成爲身體兩足與裙。</p>
<p>第三圖，在身體的上面，用紙剪開兩側，拉出中間的棒成爲兩手，最後做成面孔，可是頭面切不可太大，若是太大，可剪去少許。</p>
<p>第四圖，還有一結，用以做帽子，其無用的完全切去，於是變第五圖西洋婦人的型了。</p>
<h3>驢的義氣</h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>距北平城外約三十里，有一小村，村中有一位姓龍的老百姓，某日，他乘了驢子到北平去趕市。在中途忽然遇了强盜，囊中的金錢貨物和所乘的驢子，都被那强盜搶去了後來過了半年，那驢子忽然負一個小孩子回到龍家，龍家的人，都奇怪極了。那小孩子的年齡，祇有六七歲，龍家的人，詳細問明了他的姓名住址，想到第二日，送他回去的。不料那小孩子的父親，就是刧奪龍某財物的强盜，他見龍某親自送他的兒子歸家，心中不但十二分恐慌，而且十二分感激，遂將從前搶奪的財物，加倍送還龍某，哀求龍某恕他一命，並且立誓永不再爲强盜。龍某見其誠心誠意，也不追究旣往，至於那驢子，何以負了小兒回到龍家的呢？原來有一天，那强盜的兒子，騎了驢子在外邊遊玩，驢子是認識路徑，又想到它舊時的主人，因此乘間負了那小孩逃回來的。</p>

<h3>遂安珍眉略趨堅漲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、遂安來路莊之珍眉綠茶、英莊同孚協和等行、進意仍濃厚、因市上存底缺乏、來源稀少、售盤已較前略爲堅漲、土莊珍眉、去路亦頗爲活潑、惟各茶廠、前因產地毛茶價貴、洋莊又閉不開市、進貨均極稀少、故日來亦無大宗新様佈出、以致供不應求、惟溫州珍眉一項、市面略爲軟弱云、</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>「失業與失戀」</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>「失業與失戀」是黨國元老蔡子民先生日前在丨一個由討論時事爲目的聚餐會而演進成爲一個正式民衆組織的丨「時社」的成立大會中所講的題目。記者因參與末座，故亦深以得聆名言爲幸。現在很願意將所聽得的主旨所在與觀感所及同讀者談談。</p>
<p>蔡先生對于題目的本身分析得非常詳細，他說：「失業與失戀，在表面上看來，是社會上一個很普通的問题，而不是什麽政治，經濟等專門的大問題，但是牠的重要性却又正是一切古今敎育政治經濟與社會學的思想家所要解决而研究的根本對象。但到了現在，這個問題非獨没有解决，且有愈趨愈難于解决的景象。我們看報紙上所載的無論是屬于政治經濟的新聞或是以娛樂爲目的的電影片内容所暗示的，無不是直接或間接表顯着要急切解决這問題與呈露着全世界「失業與失戀」的情勢日益擴大而有不可收拾的趨向……」蔡先生對于這兩個問題的前途表示要改進維持現狀的制度方有辦法。他以爲「失業」是由于目前各國的政治與生產制度不良所直接造成的結果；而「失戀」却又是傅統思想與習慣爲中心的家庭制度所形成的自然現象。最後他說：「但是我們看到現在國難的日趨嚴重而同時失業與失戀的人亦日見其多，我們要呌這班人來注意救國問題，似乎是不可能的一件事。這是很値得我們討論與思想的，今日特提出來與「時社」諸君子談談，實不得稱之爲演講。」</p>
<p>記者對於蔡先生所說的，在原則上是表示同意，但是對於謀求「失業與失戀」的解决辦法方面，却另外有一點反感。我們覺得這個問題（失業與失戀）的解决途徑，不是已有飯吃與已有愛人的仁人君子所能越俎代謀，必有待于「失業與失戀」者的大衆，在普遍的覺悟以後，自己去尋求，奮鬭，拚命和犧牲，方能入於解放的大道。</p>
<p>不過「失業與失戀」者可不必一定要恨「有業與有戀」的人。「失業與失戀」者的公敵，乃是造成「失業與失戀」的制度以及阻礙「失業與失戀」者謀求解放的少數制度「統治」者。</p>
<h3>生活我的「外快」</h3>
<p>— 根生</p>
<p>賣糕小販</p>
<p>這天早上四點半鐘，紗廠汽管響第一聲時，我就起來把白炭在爐子裏燒猛，放在熬盤下面，熬盤上揩了一些猪油，再把糕放上去。接着咭咭刮刮的發出聲音來。這時紗廠汽管已響第三聲了，我趕緊把蒸籠盒取出，前面配上熬盤，成了一副擔子丨丨賣糕擔，由後門挑出到了紗廠門口。許多小販丨丨有賣大餅油條的，有賣糯米飯的，早在那裏伺候了，其對象就是紗廠工人。我於是一同凑熱鬧：「兩個銅板一塊，火熱的猪油糕丨」我眞有勇氣呀！</p>
<p>居然這様的呌起來。</p>
<p>呃，生意倒還不錯，一個半鐘頭銅板賣進了一百五十多個。顧主大半是「小姑娘」。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>天色漸漸亮起來了，紗廠已關了門，買主不大有了。「走罷丨」我自己對自己講了一聲，定了定神，覺得異常快活，於是挑着擔子向斯必薩路契文路一帶走去。口裏大聲地唱着「熱個……猪油糕……哉丨」弄堂裏的小孩子們最注意這聲浪，居然跑了出來，揑着銅板買糕。有幾個銅板没有的只好仿我的調子學唱着。轉灣抹角，一走兩走，時辰鐘已十點了，身體也覺得疲倦起來，炭風爐也自顧自的休息。「還是回去罷丨」我肚裏這様估量着，「走丨走丨」回到家裏煑了兩碗米飯，一塊腐乳，八個銅板下菜，吃飽了略事休息，洗了三件衣服，已快一點半鐘。於是整整圍身，仍然挑起擔子向契文路跑，匝過斯里路，莫爾干路，走上又袋角，從小孩子手裏騙了幾個銅板。再走過去看見一簇人聚集着，屋子裏面正在唱揚州戲：母女二個，唱得非常起勁，有時裝哭，有時裝笑，想不到她們倒有這様動人的藝術。我於是利用這時機，賣去了不少的糕。「兩個銅板一塊，猪油糕火熱丨」</p>
<p>太陽漸漸下去了，我以爲紗廠門口還有一批生意可做，因爲她們五點半鐘要放工，就趕快挑了過去，到×屯路後半段歇了擔子伺候着。有兩個孩子在我的糕盤邊圍繞着，心表很想吃糕，但手裏却没有銅板。有一個很可愛，我就拿了一塊糕分給他們兩個孩子吃，他們快活極了。旁邊一位小姑娘看見了，喊了起來：「××丨××（小孩子的名字）在吃賣糕人的糕呀丨」果然，小孩子的阿姊跑了出來，跟着他的母親也走出來。</p>
<p>「××丨你臉皮要不要呀？」他的母親這様高呼着說。</p>
<p>「没有什麽要緊，數目有限丨」我同時回答着。</p>
<p>她們說了，拉着孩子自顧自的進去。紗廠裏吃人的怪獸聲又嗚嗚地呌起來了，側門一開，整千整萬的勞動者前擠後擁的攢了出來。我急忙將擔子挑過去抖生意，然而，過問的總是寥若晨星，原因是他們預備回家去燒飯吃，不需要這點心；早上呢，因爲要趕鐘點，來不及燒飯，所以馬馬虎虎吃些點心就算。按廠規，過了鐘點是不准進去做工的，這是我得來的經騐了。</p>
<p>時候快六點鐘了，整整擔子回家，中飯還有剩餘，就燒了點泡飯來吃。燈下總算起來，上下午一共賣去了一百多塊糕，計得銅板三百多個，除付銷糕店老板二百二十五個外，還有七十幾個盈餘，，這就是今天一天的酬勞，吃兩頓苦飯是勉强夠了的。當然，一不當心被照會巡捕查到了，捉進行裏去「罰錢」，這項保險並没有計算在内，就是一個不幸，偶然在馬路上發起痧疹來也只有天曉得丨至於得來的新聞資料，那自然是我的「外快」了。</p>

<h3>陸根榮</h3>
<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>廠長</p>
<p>陸根榮躱在機器後，眼睛活溜地向四邊探望着。右手的中指和食指之間，夾着一段燃燒着的香烟，一縷縷的青烟往上升，一圈一圈毫無顧忌的往空中直冒。陸根榮頻頻的吸着長長的氣，把它吹散了開去。</p>
<p>「廠長！」旁邊的萬阿福低低的警告着。陸根榮很機警的將烟頭揑滅，很快的往青布衣袋内一塞。抬起頭來看時，廠長的一簇小鬍子，已發現在他所工作的機器前面。兩隻威光四射的，像老鼠一樣的小眼睛，給了陸根榮一種不寒而慄的恐怖。</p>
<p>「工牌多少號？」廠長很簡單的問。</p>
<p>「我没有……廠長……」</p>
<p>「禁止吸烟的牌子不是白掛的！違者開除，不用多說閒話，快拿工牌出來！」</p>
<p>「我没有吸烟，廠長！」陸根榮雖然在恨着自己今天的手術不好，因爲那烟頭未曾完全揑滅，口袋裏的青烟還是直</p>
<p>民間偶語</p>
<h3>「勞工」不能「神聖」的原因</h3>
<p>— 陸振</p>
<p>彷佛聽得革命是爲大衆謀福利的，是以所謂革命人物也者，滿口子都是「爲大衆而革命，爲大衆而犧牲」的成語；針對着勞工之重要性，而「勞工神聖」四字便更呼喊得特别響亮：似乎不如此便不足以談革命一樣。蓋經營革命者，固必須有一個應時的金字招牌也。</p>
<p>「勞工神聖」高唱入雲的時候，正是革命潮流方興未艾，而革命還未成功的時候。</p>
<p>現在呢，據說革命已經成功了，可是我們所看到的「勞工」，似乎還不大「神聖」。或者在某些地方，還可以聽見一些近於「勞工神聖」的呼聲，但已經不是從那些所謂革命人物也者的口裏放出。縱然有時「布」的一聲從他們口裏放將出來，也不過限於「布」的一聲而已！</p>
<p>於是我們可以眞確的斷言：「勞工神聖」除了被用爲金字招牌外，便是從未兌現過的支票。如曰不然，則請徵諸事實。古之人有言曰「神聖不可侵犯」（今之人類也這樣說），可知所謂「神聖」者，即暗藏有不可侵犯之意。而現在的「勞工」，則確確實實是可被侵犯的，「神聖」在那裏呢？而且侵犯勞工的人，也就是在革命成功前高唱「勞工神聖」的人！</p>
<p>有人說，大凡什麽東西之「神聖」與不「神聖」，完全由於牠本身所具備的條件來决定。譬如說，從前的「勞工」是革命的，所以就應該「神聖」，而今的「勞工」是反革命的，所以便不應該「神聖」了。至於革命與反革命的標準，正當以對於同時的統治者的利害關係爲指針。，譬如說，你們與統治者有利害的衝突，就是反革命；反之，便是革命了。所以大清帝國及北洋軍閥目「孫」「黄」爲叛徒，而現在的統治者則尊之爲革命元首，猶之乎革命人物也者，說從前的「勞工」是革命，而現在則是反革命的一樣。明乎此，則現在「勞工」之不「神聖」，並非偶然。</p>
<p>親愛的「勞工」们　你們也想「神聖」一點嗎？如果想，你們就得顧全與現在的統治者的利害關係。至於受點「壓迫」，受點「剥削」，那是不要緊的，甚而至於就無法生存，你們也得絕對忍耐的去實行「勞資合作」，努力「增加生產」，否則，就會有反革命的嫌疑，而不能「神聖」了。</p>

<p>往外冒，但是他不得不仍是硬着頭皮否認。</p>
<p>「哈哈·····哈！」廠長像怪鴞一般地笑起來了。「快拿出來罷，一會兒衣服會燒起來了。」</p>
<p>陸根榮知道不能再强辯了，祇得向廠長求饒，同時他想到了自己的家裏還有着母親和妻子，便不由自主的跪在廠長面前。</p>
<p>「起來！起來！這是没有用的。我不能爲你一個人破了廠規，你不報工號，我自己查去。」</p>
<p>廠長怒冲冲的走到辦公室。</p>
<p>坐在廠長對面桌上的副廠長，這時正吸着一枝白金龍。看見廠長進來，便搭訕着道：</p>
<p>「中國貨的香烟，終究没有好東西，我今天嘗嘗這白金龍，烟葉比小茄力克要差多了。」</p>
<p>「唔，中國商人最善於欺騙，所以没有好東西會製造出來的！」</p>
<p>廠長依據他自己的理論，因此中國烟是不吸的。他慢慢地燃上了烟斗，一邊在答復着副廠長，一邊在查陸根榮的工號。</p>
<p>辦公室的門開了，工頭陪着陸根榮剛走進了一步來，副廠長的大半支白金龍便「嘶！」的一聲犧牲在痰盂裏了，到底是正廠長，烟斗不過暫時擱在桌子一邊。</p>
<p>「他是第一次違禁，家裏還有大小五口，都仗着他養活，請廠長發發慈悲，把他的懲罰减輕些罷！」工頭指着陸根榮在向廠長說情，陸根榮躱在工頭身後，用希望的目光注視着廠長的面部。</p>
<p>「好！你給他來說情麽？我且問你，你做工頭是管什麽的？工人有違禁的行爲，都要靠我來查獲，那我們一天到晚還能辦别的事麽？老實說這是給我查見了，要是萬一總理進廠來看見了，你我全得倒霉！你旣同他說情，你自己替他另找工作去罷，我這裏從明天起是不要他了！」廠長說了一套話，工頭兩隻眼翻了一翻，一言不發的走了，剩下陸根榮一個人，呆若木鷄的還站在那裏。</p>
<p>「還不去麽？」副廠長似乎痛惜他那大半支白金龍，也吆喝了一聲。於是陸根榮含着眼淚，踽踽地走出去了。同時，辦公室裏又劃了兩根火柴，氤氳的青烟瀰漫了一室。</p>

<h3>朝奉面孔</h3>
<p>— 景賢</p>
<p>從一號起，一直辛苦到月底，老板看着怪可憐兒的，譬如做慈善事業，汒屢包裏挖出雪白大洋錢，發薪水了。雖然不淌血，但是賣了一個月汗，拿這一些薪水，在老板，已經是慷慨之至，而在我們做小夥伙的呢，雖然感到「吃不飽，餓不死」之痛，但是，唉，天哪！……所以小子每承我們那位娶了三位姨太太的老板發薪的那天，總是把手堵着袋口回家，生怕路上遇到了比我多一隻手的朋友，像日本扶助「滿洲國」般的來替我口袋裏的大洋錢打算。一路平安到了家裏，老婆見了眉花眼笑，打算要做襯絨旗袍，預備上蘇州去吃喜酒。兒子見了雙脚直跳，嚷着要捐兩塊錢買「航空救國」徽章。好容易連哄帶騙，一個一個解决掉了，搬過曾祖父手裏傅下的十三檔算盤，滴搭滴搭，算來算去，房錢，米錢油鹽醬醋，學費，人情，一切一切，正好兩訖。心血來潮，靈機一轉，不得了，到期利息，尙未着落，債主的臉，委實可怕，怎麽辦！頭皮搔搔，無法可想，惟有上「高牆裏的娘舅家」去。</p>
<p>我旣有了「决心」，向着「一貫方針」邁進。羅雀掘鼠，長衫短褂，打了一包裏，賊頭狗腦，怕人瞧見般的望「十八個月爲滿，月放五天」的××當裏一鑽。兩手高擎着包裏，像說書先生敬茶般的向高櫃上一放。窮人撞來撞去，總是没有好機會的，無巧不巧，說時遲，那時快，朝奉先生剛巧一屁股坐下去用飯。典當規矩是朝奉不肯放飯碗，當當的儘急是没用的，我所遇到的朝奉當然也不能例外。，待到他邊談，邊說，邊笑，邊吃，挨過了二十分鐘，我想，這可來了。豈知他連正眼都不瞧一瞧，嚷着臺步，去洗臉，抽水烟。一切都公畢了，纔一臉不高興的來打開我的包裏。遠遠地向别處望了一望，說：「多少？」我忙說，「寫三十塊錢」。「都是舊的，當足十塊」。他一面說，一面把衣服往外一推。我還想說時，他早已不耐煩地說，「你到别處去當！」說着，又把水烟筒一提，睬都不來睬你了。</p>
<p>這就呌做「朝奉面孔」。這是比濫殺無辜平民的皇軍們更要難看的一種嘴臉。但是事實告訴我們，近來一般普通商人，摹仿「朝奉面孔」的，十停裏倒有五六停，除非來的顧客是一位摩登女子，或是從汽車裏吐出來的「上等人」。老板們儘打着「招待週到」的口號，無奈「餓不能死，吃不能飽」的小伙計們，想到了「妻啼饖，兒號寒」的一幕，想到了去賞鑑「朝奉面孔」的難堪，委實的要不免自然而然地抑制不住煩燥的情緒，而形成一副不堪承敎的「朝奉面孔」了。不錯，小夥計用「朝奉面孔」對待主顧，果然是「豈有此理」的一回事，必須要「注重商人敎育」，「對待顧客要有禮貎」，但是，唉，天哪，……夫復何言！</p>
<p>業餘修學</p>
<h3>讀書會</h3>
<p>— 邵韻</p>
<p>在一般的店員中，很多是由於家貧無力再繼續求學而就半途改入商界。雖然他們没有再進校的可能，然而，他們的求知慾，却仍是很堅强的。爲了滿足求知慾，他們是需要利用空睱的時間來自修。但對於自修，最感到困難之處就是：看不懂的地方，没有人可詢問，或者是找不到自己對於某一問題的見解是不是對的。如果對集合幾個同自己一樣歡喜研究的朋友，組織一個讀書會，那麽，上面這些困難就可解决，因爲，這様，大家可以常常互相研究和討論了。</p>
<p>讀書會最好每星期開一次會，討論所讀的書中的疑難之處，或是討論對於某一問題的見解。因爲有很多的地方，往往一個人所不能解决的，經過幾個人的討論之後，就會得到相當的解决的。</p>
<p>除了舉行討論會以外，還可定期舉行辯論會，就所讀過的書中找出幾個可以爭辯的問題，或是拿報上所看到的比較重要的問題，指定某些會員主張正面，某些會員主張反面，開會辯論。這能夠訓練心智的組織力，養成雄辯的口才，並帮助自己對於某些問題的了解。或是，當大家讀完某一本書後，每人報告他讀那本書的心得，對於那本書的批評；因爲各人對於某一本書，都有不同的意見，所以依據這種報告和批評也可以互相辯論的。</p>
<p>爲了增加讀書的興趣和進步起見，可經常舉行學術講演會，邀請學識豐富者來講演學術上或是其他的實際問題。在未舉行這會以前，每個會員對於這次要講演的問題，須先有自己的見解，然後聽了演講之後就可拿來和自己的見解比較了。如遇有不明白的地方，也可以當塲詢問。</p>
<p>讀書會還有個好處，那就是節省金錢。譬如甲會員買一本「怎様研究新社會科學」，乙會員就可買「怎様研究新興文學」或其他的書籍，大家可互相交換輪流閱讀了。如果某一本書，是每個會員都須人手一編的，那末，用讀書會的名義，去買幾本同様的書籍，是可以得到照定價九折或八折的折扣的。</p>
<p>如果是在大商店或工廠中組織讀書會，那還可出定期會刋，内容是登載論文，書報介紹批評以及讀書筆記等文字。至於印刷，經濟寬裕的可用油印，否則抄寫一份貼在壁上也可以。</p>

<p>小百姓議院</p>
<h3>紗廠减工工友生活應如何維持案</h3>
<p>— 討論者議員阿眞</p>
<p>在上週的「小百姓議院」裏　　　字法文　的一個提案，便想起幾句緊要　　　　我也是一個紗廠的工人。</p>
<p>我們在報上見着的，除了蘇聯以外，不論是老大的英帝國主義，新興的「花旗牌」，戰勝國的「法蘭西」和用飛機，大砲，毒瓦斯與「同文同種」的我國講「親善」的「紅疤疤」，以及最近用帝國旗卍字旗的德意志，……一樣的充滿着失業和飢餓的大衆，尤其是我們工人，不論東和西都不能保持牛馬似的生活水準。</p>
<p>這時候，我們工人們望誰來解决我們這個問題呢？日内瓦的國際聯盟勞工局嗎？誰也知道是幾個大洋流氓在那兒向一部分落後的工人羣衆弄玄虚。向要人們請願嗎？又那一次請願是得着勝利的？，况且巡捕，警察，包打聽，三角碼子，工賊等等無時無地不在監視着我們，一「動」則「反」，危險非凡丨向廠主叩頭乞憐嗎？那更是一件傻瓜幹的勾當，在汽車，洋房和姨太太懷抱裏的資本家，根本是不會可憐我們這些奴才的。</p>
<p>「爲了我們全體工人的利益，只有怎様幹才對？」我想一定有人會這様的問我。</p>
<p>直截了當的說，過去的一切事實早已敎訓我們只有這條唯一的出路：</p>
<p>團結即是力量。一切工人團結起來，組織自己的工會，反對工賊來欺騙和破壞，反對非工人來自命爲領導者，反對减工，反對資本家向我們工人進攻，並努力爭取我們的生活保障。</p>
<p>特種自我職業介紹</p>
<h3>「半母親」的悲呼</h3>
<p>— 潘詠流女士</p>
<p>我眞料想不到我的境遇會變到這般可怕的田地，更不料在高中畢業後的現在，竟找不着一個糊口的處所！確是啊！我是嘗遍了人生的滋味苦和樂。去年一學期小學敎員的生活，已把我壓榨得精疲力盡，可是那刻薄的校長所給我的報酬，還不能解决我個人的衣食問題。但是我現在，並不是希求和羡慕那般太太或摩登化小姐們的生活，而是爲了生存的掙扎，不得不離開故鄕的一切而單獨地跑到這廣大的都市裏來。我心底深處確是抱了十二萬分的熱沈和希望，希望自己不至於做生活途上的餓莩。然而到現在，事實給我的敎訓，是呌我再不要在那幻想的迷夢裏沉淪了。這一個月亭子間裏的光陰，連我自己都不知怎様消磨去了啊！雖然有時也徬徨在那喧鬧的馬路傍但一見那閒情逸致的人們的笑容，太太小姐們驕傲的表情，和流水般的汽車雄威的喇叭聲，我心裏便越湧現出無限的悲哀和憤恨。我爲了生活的鞭策和驅使，也曾找遍了我所認識的朋友，可是他們給我的答覆又大都是「無法可想」這様冷淡淡的幾個無關重要的字，這使我對於自己生活的前途起了恐怖。我想，假使像這樣的生活再要延長下去，那我怕不是要變做異鄕的孤魂嗎？唉！這難道是我的命運應該如此？在過去，我雖絕對不相信那所謂的宿命論，然而到了現在，事實給我的反映使我不得不懷疑，更使我不能忍受，尤其是這肚子裏七個月無辜的小生命，難道他也有什麽罪惡的嗎？假若再這様的下去，那我不是要連累了他嗎？唉！我每想到這裏的時候，我眼中的淚水就好比萬丈兇猛的波濤，澎湃地奪眶而出呀！過去我實在不會預想到現社會是這麽的一幅圖畫，更是這般的崎形。失業給予我的苦痛，使我深刻地認識和了解了現社會的一切眞相。可是啊！我目前窘迫的問題││這肚子裏的小生命眼見得一天大似一天，我還能在這兒坐以待斃嗎？難道這廣大的社會裏就找不着我一個人糊口之所嗎？我爲了解决產時及目前生活問題，只要找到每月二十元的工作，這就是我對於我的生存的一線希望了。根據過去敎育和社會給我的技能，如：寫字員，家庭敎師，校對等職，我都可勝任，此外還能寫作短篇小說。這，說得好聽一點，是我願竭誠爲社會服務；乾脆點說，是願將自己的精神勞動來換取這二十元代價的生活費。凡需要這項精神勞動的先生們，請在本刋内賜覆吧。</p>

<h3>影戲院中的音樂會</h3>
<p>— 靈山</p>
<p>大光明開幕聲中的新玩意</p>
<p>大光明影戲院，在没有翻造以前，每逢星期日晚上一塲，本來都是租給公共租界工部音樂隊舉行音樂會的。現在大光明的影戲，還没有開幕，而音樂會却已於上星期日起開始舉行了。但是，他們以前所奏演的，完全是泰西音樂，所以聽衆除掉很少嗜好音樂的華人外。都是外國人。</p>
<p>近來有一位俄國作曲家阿甫夏洛穆夫，憑着旅華十年，研究中國戲劇的經騐，來創作一種中西合璧的戲曲，他說中國音樂，很有豐富優美的旅律。可惜樂式簡短，花調獨多，令人生厭。如能採用西洋和聲對位轉調種種作曲方法，把中國的民間歌謠，製成長篇的交響曲，一定能夠得着極好的效果。如是那第四交響曲「北平胡同印象記」和啞劇「琴心波光」等曲，就從他的理想中實現了！</p>
<p>這兩個曲，聽說在本月二十一日，工部局弦樂隊在大光明舉行音樂會時，都要拿來演奏了。樂隊指導，由梅百器博士擔任，並且那啞劇是由梅蘭芳導演的丨聽說梅氏還預備登塲漏一漏臉丨·扮演者是湯西崖，湯惠及電影女明星袁美雲和育材公學幾個學生，這種玩意兒，倒也可以算得大光明開幕聲中的一種最好的點綴。</p>
<p>阿氏又因爲中國樂器，音域太狹，構造粗陋，很不容易表現深刻的情節，但，</p>
<p>是要專用外國樂器，則又無以顯露中國樂器的特殊音色，所以他主張來一個中西合璧，將中國的絲竹鼓鈸等，和西洋樂器配合起來，所以這一次的奏演，可以說是空前未有的盛舉。將在中國戲劇界，放一異彩。阿氏後面，頗有許多有力者熱心贊助，在此劇公演後，還預備組織一改革國劇的劇團，俾使阿氏得以專心著作，以實現他的整個計畫呢。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「除夕」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>除夕，年關，在現實的中國社會中，正是一幅莊嚴面慘酷的圖畫。那末以這除夕爲電影的題材，自然是甚爲新頴而適當的，假如我們能夠深入社會而把握住那種現實社會所發展的其實之經濟的意義，那末我們才能對於這複雜的問題得着一個澈底的解决。但是，在這「除夕」的畫面中，却祇能告訴我們這種現象的表面，它說明了富人們在除夕跳舞，飲酒，吃醋，爭風，偷情，浪費，同時也說明了窮人們在這風雪交加的年關中無錢應付債主，賣兒鬻女，甚至於自殺。但是結論是什麽呢？「人心不古」，「世道日衰」，老學究在自己的生死關頭，還得疏財仗義，高利貸的錢莊主也肯樂善好施。</p>
<p>很明顯的，「除夕」中對於經濟的機構没有深切的認識，它完全没有理解高利貸的剥削關係，於是祇好請富翁大發慈悲來救人之急了。於是居然有舊道德典型的老學究將自己由押女兒而來的金錢「好施而不望報」的送給别人了，（並且還是一個路不拾遺的君子）。當然這都是「鏡花緣」中君子國的人物，這種非現實的劇情，它是以舊道德來解决這嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>如上所述，這個劇本的確是很成問題的。</p>
<p>可是我可對於導演姜起鳳先生的進步，却是不能忽視的。不僅是在意識方面他漸漸的走上了新的途徑，即就技巧說，大部份也很使我們覺得滿意。他將這比較複　的劇情，很有條理的在畫面上表現出來，全部的畫面都很美麗。但是劇情不夠緊張，没有顯明的高潮，雖然是應當敎人流淚的悲劇，可是不能上分動人感情。可以說在Ｉｎｓｐｉｒａｔｉｏｎ方面是很欠缺的。最主要的他對於各個人物的個性，没有嚴密的分析，例如蔣君超在劇中旣然是一個好義勇爲打抱不平的青年，他就應當是一個剛毅而堅强的人物决不會因三百元而怯懦的自殺。其後又忽然勇敢起來，反而勸老學究「奮鬥」，前後就很矛盾。關於其他的演員，總算都　指揮得當。表演方面，要以陳燕燕最爲逼眞而成功。劉繼羣在這裏飾一忠厚的老人，確比他所飾的滑稽角色適當得多。何非光是失敗的。邢少梅很可以。</p>
<p>其他還有漏洞，如電車中當着衆人翻出許多鈔票，在馬路上可以看舞塲中的内容，劉繼羣手拿着鈔票一點也不怕别人搶刦。</p>
<p>但是在本劇中有一個特點，那便是攝影的成功。在國產片中却是很少有的。字幕很少而恰當。佈景亦適合劇情。</p>
<p>總之，假如我們對於國產片不必過於苟求的話，那末這是一部水準以上的作品。</p>
<h3>海戰影片是怎様攝的</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>看過外國海戰影片的觀衆，大半以爲是從實地攝取的；這種攝影法不但不合理，並且亦很不經濟。而且攝影藝術已經踏到完美之境的歐美，焉有不採取最經濟，而最實用的方法麽？我想讀者裏面，要想明瞭平日所懷爲謎的這攝影法者，必亦不在少數吧！因此特撰此文，以饗讀者諸君。</p>
<p>目下在歐美及日本各國，攝製海戰影片大都是用一個有機關的，很大的長方形水桶，將很小的戰艦模型，浮在水上。只要把在水桶側面的機關一轉，桶水就好像海戰時的海洋似的，波浪澎湃起來了。小戰艦亦因此搖動不已，遠遠的望去，大有正在海洋中戰爭之槪。攝影師就將這塲面攝下後，再加上一點修飾，就是所謂海戰的一慕了。親眼看見尙且有點相像，那不能怪你們在電影院看這已經過許多手續後映出來的，當牠是實地攝來的呵！</p>
<p>至於在戰艦上飛翔的飛機，那更可笑了；牠不過是一隻玩具的飛機被很細的繩子，掛在一根竹棒上搖擺着而已。觀衆不能看破其中的幻妙，乃是攝影師的本領使之然也。</p>
<p>上面所說的不過是海戰影片的遠景；至於攝近景時，所攝的人物，亦不是眞的乘在眞的戰艦上的。那戰艦是用木板和鐵條所製成的，眞戰艦的一部分。四面那裏有什麽海，因爲配光得法，所以你們不注意到罷了。冲進來的海水是從上面和下面倒進去的呀！</p>
<p>雖然，好的方法須與好的藝術並行才能得到眞正的成功，所以這裏好的攝影藝術是不可以缺少的。不然「畫虎反類狗」了。</p>
<p>南京路大陸商塲中國國貨公司，爲提倡國貨時裝起見，舉行時裝大會，吳市長夫人亦到，海上名媛翩然蒞止，并有電影明星胡蝶，胡萍，徐來等十餘人，加入時裝表演，博得不少佳評。此爲胡蝶女士新裝之圖也。</p>
<h3>却利卓别麟的怪癖</h3>
<p>— 慕珠</p>
<p>卓别麟平生有一種與人不同的怪皮氣。其行爲的浪漫簡直是無有比倫，大約是基於他天賦的特癖而養成的。他的性格除了他的妻子（現在也分手了）和手下之外恐怕没有别一個人體會得到。執拗，審愼，頑固，放蕩，狂熱幾種衝突的個性的集合才成就卓氏整個的人格。在拍戲的某一天，正在工作最緊張的當兒，卓氏對他的手下說：「太累了！我們到歐洲去逛逛罷。他們聽說之下，立刻停止一切工作，趕快替主人收拾好行李：因爲他們看透這位主人的皮氣了。隔一天，刦利就眞的起程赴歐了。照普通人看來，你說卓氏的皮氣怪不怪呢。還有，卓氏家裏築有一所輝煌的游泳池，可是他從來没有行過下水禮。一天，他不知如何的高興起來，即刻去換了衣服，跳入池裏大游而特游，一直游到不能顫動的地步，方喚人把他抬到牀上躺下，然後才說過興呢。這不過是拉雜的幾件事實，但足以證明卓氏天字號的怪癖了。聽說他過去的愛人和離了婚的妻子足足有七位之多。最近「禍水」的女主角波拉尼格利也曾和他發生過愛情。却利多麽豔福啊！可惜一個個的破裂的破裂，離婚的離婚，鬧得滿城風雨，結果他還是獨身的漢子。現在好像他又想再嘗試結婚的滋味，對手也找到了，但是她或者尙未注意到却利的好處呢。傳聞卓氏進行拍攝「拿破崙」的計劃，打算自已擔任導演並當主角。也許他索性不參加角色而找别人去做。可是這位幸運的角兒不知何時何日才能物色得着呢。</p>
<h3>穿裙爲什麽？</h3>
<p>— 鄔清芬</p>
<p>我看過有許多中國影片，裏面有表演什麽老年婦人，或舊式中年女子的，老是穿着裙。這一點在我的腦海裏却引起了一個問題：「她們爲什麽要穿裙子呢？」我們中國在滿清的時候婦女的禮服是大衫和裙，不過到現在民國的時代還流行着，所以在街上仍可以看見那些老年的婦女穿着裙；但是要知道她們，遇到了喜慶大事，或探訪親友等方纔穿一穿，平日在家裏是不常穿的。可是今見影片中在普通的老夫婦談話間，或平時在家内，也穿起了裙子，呌我看起來，是不合理的。因爲影戲是寫實的，不像新劇。（却酬）</p>
<h3>電影小說秘密（Ｓｅｃｒｅｔｓ）（八）</h3>
<p>— 開羅</p>
<p>沈香胸中悶悶地走開了。他心中思量着，但願他們仍舊回到村野之中，遠離這花花絮絮的人羣。那裏有租糙的生活勤苦的工作，可以使人走正路，不生斜念。在沈香飽經憂患的心中，這種綺羅叢中的安逸，比鄕村生活艱險得多了。</p>
<p>因爲約翰的勢力，一天一天地澎張起來，當然就有一般趨炎附勢的人，來趨奉他。他自然而然地走上了政客的一條路，因爲那是財勢所有者惟一的歸宿。他幾年以來，四出演購，遊行到處受人歡迎。除了一班攀龍附驥的男人以外，還有一班抱絕大野心的女子，去勾引他，而這位麥汀納茲小姐，亦就是其中之一。</p>
<p>麥汀納茲這次參加卡頓宅中的跳舞會，並不是卡頓請她來的，她是抱了絕大的野心來的。曼麗終夕竭力鎭壓着心中的悲苦，在賓客之中週旋着，外貌裝着落落大方的様子。耐到更闌人散的時候，她再也支持不住了。她獨自一個溜了出去，跑到一個小客聽奥，伏在一張沙發上，淌着眼淚。不意這時麥汀納茲已跟踪而來。曼麗聽見外面低低敲着門，她連忙將眼淚擦乾將門開了。這位西班牙少婦進來了。</p>
<p>麥汀納茲進來之後，二人相對無言了半天。他們互相估量着彼此的力量。最後麥汀納茲開口了。她說「我惟一的理由，就是我愛你的丈夫！」</p>
<p>「那是不會的」，曼麗很安閑地說。「倘使你眞心待他，怎肯質貿然跑到他的家裏，當了許多賓客朋友，恥辱他和他的妻子家屬呢？」</p>
<p>「這點我抱歉得很，我聽差了人家的話了。但事實還是存在，就是我愛你的丈夫，他也愛我。」說時麥汀納茲裝出很恭顧的様子。</p>
<p>「這一點我也不能承認，」曼麗毫不遲疑地說。「當然，我的丈夫是受了你勾引了，這是無疑的。你相貌亦生得很動人。但亦僅此而已。我是深知我丈夫的。」</p>
<p>「你知道你的丈夫嗎？」麥汀納茲抗聲說道？「你的丈夫需求的是快樂，自由，和熱情，但你不能供給他。你對於你的丈夫，是完全不了解的。他需要自由！但他說你一定不肯放他走的。」</p>
<p>「我的丈夫……這様對你說的嗎？」曼麗竭力裝作鎭靜地說。</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「他愛你……他要我釋放他襄他娶你……但我不答應……他和你這様講的嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的。」　　　　　　　　（未完）</p>
<h3>美國大批演員出口</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>美國近來的排外風潮激起了許多外籍明星的反感，紛紛的自動脫離最近在一星期之中，計脫離美國而回本國老家去的外籍明星十五顆未成星的演員二十八人，至於準備動身的現在不計其數，這是好萊塢從來未有的騷動，現在美國當局亦非常的恐慌，惟恐好萊塢將感到人才的缺乏，而釀成營業上的危機，所以現在的排外手段已有改善的動機云。</p>

<h3>Our Army Withdraws from Defense Lines around Renzikou and Gaotaizi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Clear cannon fire can be heard tonight at Leizhuang. The situation in Luanzhou is very tense. Our army, fearing attacks from both front and rear, has moved westward. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

This morning, Chinese newspapers strongly criticized those who fled Beiping in a panic for their lack of courage. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Sells the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<h3>Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>Refutes Litvinov's Argument that the Sino-Soviet Agreement is Invalid</p>
<p>Japan will Reply to Russia Regarding Negotiations with the Puppet State to Sell the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>The Puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs Plans to Take Over Full Management Authority of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is deeply shocked by the change in attitude of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov regarding the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway and lodged a protest on the evening of the 13th. In addition to delivering the protest to the Russian Ambassador Bogomolov, a telegram was also sent to our Ambassador to Russia, Yan Huiqing, to forward it to Litvinov. The telegram stated that Litvinov claimed that our government had not attended the railway's board of directors for eighteen months, therefore the Sino-Soviet Agreement on the Chinese Eastern Railway had in fact become invalid. This is because the Soviet government has not clearly listened to the reason why our government has been unable to send representatives for eighteen months, which is not a voluntary abandonment. The powers and obligations stipulated in the agreement are only temporarily impossible to continue under certain circumstances, and cannot be said to be permanently impossible. At this time, it can only be regarded as a temporary obstacle and cannot be fundamentally abolished because of this, and the responsibility for creating this reason does not lie with us. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Litvinov's declaration of preparing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway clearly violates the Sino-Soviet Agreement and harms our national sovereignty. It lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Union. The telegram was sent to our embassy in Russia on the evening of the 13th to present it to Russia. At the same time, it was also sent to the Russian ambassador to be forwarded to his government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to officially announce the full text of the protest on the afternoon of the 14th. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Chinese Ambassador Yan Huiqing told an Associated Press reporter today that the Soviet Union's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to the puppet organization will create a very bad impression among China and many other countries. He visited Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan on Tuesday night to strongly protest that this move is not only illegal and unreasonable, but also clearly violates the existing treaty. The Sino-Soviet Agreement stipulates that the future of the railway must be decided by the Chinese and Russian governments. The fact that China is temporarily unable to exercise its authority in Manchuria due to coercion should absolutely not affect its legal rights to the railway, and it is especially regrettable that this is happening so soon after China and Russia have restored friendly relations. (13th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Official circles in Tokyo heard Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's remarks on the Chinese Eastern Railway and were quite impressed, as Litvinov's words rejected China's protest and reiterated Soviet Russia's intention to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to "Manchukuo." Reports state that "Manchukuo's" railway construction program is now complete, and the value of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been greatly reduced, so this point must be taken into account when evaluating the railway. The Japanese government will reply to Soviet Russia that it will negotiate the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway with "Manchukuo." (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Attitude</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The deadline for "Manchukuo" to demand the return of vehicles from Soviet Russia expired at midnight last night. Although there is much speculation, it is not yet known what action "Manchukuo" will take. According to a white Russian newspaper here, there is a possibility of mutual concessions in this matter. The Russian Consul-General has received instructions from Moscow that if "Manchukuo" insists, he may seek a peaceful solution. The Russian government can withdraw the Russian General Manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Rudy, if necessary. The Harbin Times, run by the Japanese, which has repeatedly attacked Russian staff on the Chinese Eastern Railway, now claims that since last night, the "Manchukuo" puppet Ministry of Communications has taken over these negotiations from the hands of the Chinese staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Manchu side now officially refuses to recognize the previous agreements of Beiping and Shenyang and advocates for their abolition. If Soviet Russia insists on considering them valid, then Soviet Russia must negotiate with Zhang Xueliang and the Nanjing Central Government. However, if Soviet Russia wants to participate in the joint development of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it should discard all events from the issuance of the telegram by Karakhan on September 27, 1920 to the September 18, 1931 Shenyang Incident. Current experience has proven that the illegal actions of the Russian staff of the Chinese Eastern Railway have destroyed the basic principles of the agreement, so this agreement no longer has any reason to be considered valid. The "Manchukuo" puppet Ministry of Communications has now taken over these negotiations and will formally announce that it does not want to follow this agreement. Li Shaogeng reported to the puppet Ministry of Communications yesterday afternoon that Soviet Russia has not yet returned the vehicles it seized by the deadline. People here expect the puppet Ministry of Communications to find a way to take over the full management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Russians in Manchuli are returning to their country one after another because the Trans-Baikal Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway are no longer connected and they have nothing to do. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the military first decides the policy and then hands it over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to handle. The Army General Staff has already prepared concrete measures for the purchase, and will hold a meeting after Vice Chief Masaki returns to Tokyo to decide, after which it will be handed over to the Ministry of the Army. It is heard that the General Staff's views on purchasing the railway are as follows: According to Litvinov's statement and the explanation of the Soviet Russian authorities, the purpose of Soviet Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is to remove the root cause of the dispute between Japan, Manchuria, and Russia arising from the railway, so the Japanese government can understand the sincerity of the Russian side. Although the military and Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway) have conducted investigations into the value of the purchase, the purchase price should be determined based on the current earnings. The value of the Chinese Eastern Railway will inevitably decrease on the day the "Manchukuo" railway policy is completed, so the timing of the purchase should take this into account before it can be decided. It has not yet been decided whether the buyer will be Mantetsu or "Manchukuo," but it would be beneficial for "Manchukuo" to purchase it in light of future relations. (13th Japanese Union Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military intends to hold a joint Japanese-Russian-Manchu committee in Tokyo in accordance with Soviet Russia's wishes, so it will decide its attitude in one or two days and then negotiate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before deciding on Japan's fundamental policy. (13th Denttsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Puppet State's Actions</h3>
<p>(Harbin) "Manchukuo" Ministry of Communications, Chief Secretary Morita visited the Deputy Director of the Eastern Railway, Kotzne, this afternoon at 1:00 PM to discuss personnel issues, the connection issue between the Rabin line and the Eastern Railway, and the return of locomotives and freight cars. The "Manchukuo" side hopes for a peaceful resolution of all issues, and therefore also hopes that Soviet Russia will show sincerity. Furthermore, regarding the plan for reforming the Eastern Railway's organization proposed by Superintendent Li on the 11th, because it is an important issue, he sincerely hopes that a consultation meeting will be convened soon to achieve a satisfactory relationship between Manchuria and Russia and to do its best to develop the Eastern Railway. Moreover, Chief Secretary Morita's mission in Harbin has come to an end, so he is scheduled to return to Changchun from here on the 14th. (13th Denttsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The "Manchukuo"-set deadline for the return of vehicles expired at 12:00 PM on the evening of the 12th. Chinese Eastern Railway Superintendent Li Shaogeng issued a final ultimatum to Russian Deputy Director Konyuchov, the content of which is as follows: I requested you on April 12, 1933, to convey to your government the return within one month of the locomotives and freight cars belonging to the Chinese Eastern Railway. Now one month has passed, but your side has not returned any vehicles other than four locomotives, and no response has been received. Therefore, I will report the progress of this incident to my country's government and ask for instructions on future countermeasures. Finally, I ask you to pay attention to the extremely serious situation that is about to arrive. (13th Japanese Union Telegram)</p>
<h3>Foreign Observation</h3>
<p>(Paris) This city's Radical Party newspaper, "Le Nouveau Siècle" (The New Century), commented in an editorial today on the recent European concern about the possibility of armed conflict between Japan and Russia. The newspaper frankly expressed disbelief that such a conflict was possible, stating that the idea of conflict clearly contradicted common sense. With regard to some quarters in Europe believing that Japan would take advantage of the US government's current focus on domestic issues to realize some ambition, the newspaper stated that even in such circumstances, the peaceful attitude of the Soviet Union would not be enough to provoke a conflict. It is said that the Soviet Union has fully demonstrated evidence of its peace policy, so there is no room for doubt about its attitude. Since the Soviet government is doing its utmost to avoid war, it is also doubtful whether Tokyo would dare to disregard the great disapproval of the world and cause war. The newspaper concluded that they cannot believe that Japan is unaware of the tragedy that conflict with the Soviet Union could cause. (12th TASS Dispatch)</p>

The case was referred by the Supervisory Yuan to Supervisory Committee members Wu Hantao et al. for investigation, who considered that it should be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with the law, and it has been forwarded by the Yuan to the National Government for review and implementation.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Can Selling the Chinese Eastern Railway Avoid a Japanese-Soviet Conflict? (Hui)</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union is selling the Chinese Eastern Railway, as formally confirmed by Litvinov's remarks. The reason they hold is simply that our country has been unable to exercise its political power within the three northeastern provinces for the past eighteen months. It is not known that the Sino-Japanese conflict has not yet ended. The Chinese people have not recognized the Japanese imperialists' seizure and are using their full strength in anti-Japanese work. Although limited by the current environment, they have not been able to achieve success in fighting Japan, they have never been willing to submit.</p>
<p>We still remember when China and the Soviet Union first re-established diplomatic relations, the Soviet ambassador to China was the current Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Karakhan. At that time, some people in our country questioned the Soviet Union as to why it would not return the Chinese Eastern Railway, as it would inevitably leave the suspicion of invading our country and leave an unclean trace on Sino-Soviet friendship. Karakhan's answer at that time was roughly, "The Chinese government (referring to the Provisional Government of Beijing) is not sufficient to represent the people, nor is it capable of controlling imperialism. If the Chinese Eastern Railway is returned to China, it will inevitably be seized by local warlords and fall into the hands of imperialists. This is not beneficial to the Chinese revolution, and it is even more detrimental to the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is better for the Soviet Union to take charge, which is safer..." This argument was used to explain the Soviet Union, which was satisfactory and thoughtful. It also seemed to help the future of the Chinese revolution. Unexpectedly, today, the Soviet Union is forced by Japanese imperialists to maintain its traditional peaceful diplomacy and does not hesitate to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway for the sake of its own partial interests. We do not know if today's Japanese imperialism is different from the Japan of 1925. Is its brutality and aggressive attacks against China and the Soviet Union not worse than before?</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union were forced by Japanese military force, or if both ends of the Chinese Eastern Railway were blocked by the violence of Japanese militarism, and the Soviet Union was forced to cede the Chinese Eastern Railway in order to seek self-preservation, it would be understandable. All small and weak nations and oppressed people might even sympathize. Now the Soviet Union is automatically proposing to sell it, giving Japan an excuse to say that the Soviet Union is facing economic difficulties and wants to use the funds from the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to balance its international payments and lay the foundation for the Second Five-Year Plan. This kind of rumor not only damages the international prestige of the Soviet socialist new nation, but its planning is also very foolish, and the gains are also limited.</p>
<p>First, selling the Chinese Eastern Railway cannot ease the Japanese-Soviet conflict, nor can it be said that it is enough to exchange for peace. We recall that when Japan recognized the Soviet Union and restored Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union used the Northern Sakhalin Island as a price for peace to win Japan's favor. How long did it take for it to extend to the Chinese Eastern Railway? Moreover, Japan's invasion of our country and seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway to block the communication between Zhangduo and Outer Mongolia is because it fears that China and the Soviet Union will truly establish an understanding, unite to restrain Japan, and jointly maintain justice. Now, the Soviet Union is suddenly eager for short-term gains, wanting to gain some benefits from selling the Chinese Eastern Railway, but losing the goodwill of the Chinese nation, and failing to exchange for peace. It only loses the Soviet Union's reputation. I personally believe that the Soviet Union should not do this.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Litvinov said that our country cannot actually exercise its power in the Northeast. This is also common during a period of disguised warfare. From a distance, Alsace-Lorraine will eventually return to its original owner. More recently, in 1920, Japan sent troops to Siberia to help Semenov to counter Soviet Russia. All are clear examples. Although our Northeast is now seized by Japanese imperialists and ravaged by violence, there will eventually be a final settlement and things will return to their original owner. So why does the Soviet Union need to rush at this time, forcibly take illegal actions alone, and cause a great evil cause to the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. I personally believe that the Soviet Union should not do this.</p>
<p>Third, the Soviet Union has always been cautious and vigilant, preventing the attack of capitalist countries, and striving to maintain its hard-won victory. If it can maintain the Chinese Eastern Railway and make Japan have some scruples, then the capitalist countries will also be mentally separated and fall into contradictions. If the Chinese Eastern Railway is sold to Japan, Japan's policy of aggression against China will achieve the greatest effect, and the blockade of the Soviet Union will be more effective. Therefore, the so-called continental policy can be completed, and Siberia will be threatened by the same as the northern part of our country. This is also very detrimental to the Soviet Union itself. I personally believe that the Soviet Union should not do this.</p>
<p>Fourth, in international diplomacy, Japan has been isolated since the international ruling of thirteen votes against one vote last year and forty-two votes against one vote in February this year. The Soviet Union has become a great power that can influence the world. Now, once blinded by Japan's threatening words, it has taken the initiative to propose selling the Chinese Eastern Railway. As a result, Japan's initial lie of preventing "redification" when it invaded our country has succeeded. Britain and Japan have re-established an understanding, and the United Kingdom and the United States are also temporarily cooperating. The anti-Soviet front is becoming more and more tight, and the blockade of the Soviet Union is becoming easier to achieve. Therefore, Japan is not isolated even though it is isolated, and the Soviet Union loses friends even though it has many friends. I personally believe that the Soviet Union should not do this.</p>
<p>With these four points, the advantages and disadvantages, gains and losses are as clear as watching fire. It is also an obstacle to the future relations between China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will truly recognize this and not be confused by the short-term gains and forget the endless future troubles.</p>

<h3>Sixty-Six Countries in the World Implement Economic Truce</h3>
<p>The Organizing Committee of the Economic Conference Unanimously Decided</p>
<p>The Truce Period is from Today to the End of August</p>
<p>However, It Can Be Revised in the Event of Drastic Changes in International Exchange Rates</p>
<p>(London) The Organizing Committee of the World Economic Conference unanimously passed the proposal for an economic truce tonight, from today until after August 31st. It can only be revised in the event of drastic changes in international currency prices leading to an emergency situation. Representatives from various countries believe that if the US dollar continues to fall sharply, or if other currencies undergo drastic changes, it will endanger the trade of several countries. France and Italy are particularly concerned about the situation of the US dollar. Therefore, it was decided that if there is a sharp change in currency prices, the British Foreign Secretary Simon will convene an extraordinary meeting of the committee. In addition, the reservation proposed by Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira was accepted after obtaining the approval of his government. Under this condition, the committee unanimously decided to send the minutes of today's meeting to the governments of the sixty-six countries invited to the meeting, hoping that they can all abide by this agreement indefinitely. However, after July 31st, they can withdraw from the truce with one month's notice. According to the members, they had previously sought instructions from their respective governments on this matter, so it is expected that several countries will approve the minutes of this meeting within a few days. According to US news, the financial and official circles have had a good impact on this decision by the organizing committee, and many believe that the economic truce will be of great help to stabilizing exchange rates.</p>

<p>(London) The Organizing Committee of the World Economic Conference today agreed on a tariff standstill, but with several reservations. After the meeting of the Organizing Committee, a communiqué was issued, strongly urging the governments of other countries participating in the Economic Conference to agree to the tariff standstill. This resolution not only mentions tariffs, but also involves import quotas and other plans to restrict trade. As for the existing policies of various countries, they can still be carried out freely. Therefore, the United Kingdom can continue its commercial treaty negotiations. It is found that the Organizing Committee is composed of representatives from eight countries, namely the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, the United States, Italy, Japan, and Norway. According to the resolution passed today, the Organizing Committee advises other countries to agree not to increase or create difficulties that hinder international trade before June 12 or at the time of the meeting.

<p>Brussels Today, the Belgian cabinet has obtained the same financial and monetary dictatorial powers as the US government. Before the summer recess, the lower house of Congress granted the government the power to reduce political expenses, change official salaries, amend taxes, tariffs, and raise domestic and foreign debts by a vote of ninety-six to eighty-two, and can also take measures to curb economic behavior that hinders national credit when necessary. It is generally believed that this provision gives the government the power to deal with attacks on the franc. When the US dollar fluctuated greatly, the Belgian franc was in danger of being encircled and forced to depreciate. Therefore, the Belgian Prime Minister, in view of the storms encountered by the United States and the depreciation of the US dollar, believes that the government needs to obtain this power and stated that it will severely deal with any attempts to manipulate the foreign exchange market and suppress the franc domestically, and will also use this power to fully cooperate with such attempts abroad.

<p>Argentine Capital Tonight, the President of Argentina declared that the Argentine government is prepared to sign a reciprocal commercial treaty with the United States, and it is expected that this draft treaty can be negotiated within a few days. After the signing of this treaty, it will be the first result produced by the Washington secret economic talks. Argentina has sent a special envoy to cooperate with the ambassador to the United States to discuss the agenda of the World Economic Conference and the possibility of concluding a trade agreement with the US President. Since the United States imposed high protection taxes, Argentina's products have become increasingly narrow in the United States. When other countries followed suit to build similar barriers, Argentina's business was hit even harder, so it is urgently seeking to negotiate special measures for intra-American trade with neighboring countries. Therefore, it first negotiated a reciprocal agreement with the United States, and at the same time negotiated a commercial treaty with the United Kingdom, but it is believed that the items listed in the two treaties may not be the same. (12th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US President today signed the Rural Relief Act, which is attached with the privilege of inflating currency, but since the President has no intention of immediately exercising this power, it is generally expected that the inflation currency will be released at least after the World Economic Conference is closed, because the economic truce of the world will depend on the rational stability of exchange rates.

<h3>Roosevelt Denies Personally Attending the London Economic Conference</h3>

It was widely believed that the US President would go to London to attend the World Economic Conference, so the comments rose, and those who explored the truth were also endless, so the White House issued this denial. As for the section mentioned by Secretary of the Navy Swanson that he accepted the invitation, there has been no further indication. (12th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Uchida this afternoon to urge the Japanese government to decide on the issue of the transfer of the Eastern Railway. The reasons why Soviet Russia is eager to decide on the issue are obviously as follows: Since the establishment of "Manchukuo" and the completion of the railway, the Eastern Railway has lost its military and economic value. Especially since the Manchurian Incident, the Eastern Railway has continued to lose money, so there is no intention to bear the pain of joint operation. If the Eastern Railway continues to be jointly operated, it will leave the root of disputes between Japan, Manchuria, and Russia forever. If the Eastern Railway is transferred to Japan, which has financial resources, in addition to preventing future diplomatic disputes, it will also be easy to implement the five-year plan. As for the payment method of the sale price, in addition to the annual payment from the profit and cash of the Eastern Railway, part of it will be paid in kind, or the government of the buying country will be used as a loan to Russia. If it is sold to "Manchukuo", it is of course formally recognizing "Manchukuo". Therefore, when Ambassador Ota and Foreign Minister Litvinov met in Moscow on the 2nd, they stated that the sale of the Eastern Railway would formally recognize "Manchukuo", because the Soviet Union's disapproval resolution of the League of Nations has no relationship, so there is no hindrance. The Soviet Union of course intends to proceed to recognize "Manchukuo". (13th Electric Communication Telegram)</p>

The Ministry of Industry has also consulted the provincial and municipal governments to collect materials on the impact of the atrocities of the Japanese army on the labor situation in China, and the harsh treatment of overseas Chinese workers by local governments, in order to prepare for publicity and seek moral assistance from the conference.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Real Strength in Disarmament, Germany Will Ultimately Be Forced to Yield</h3>
<p>Hitler Schedules Opening of Reichstag</p>
<p>Neurath Visits Hindenburg</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 12th The compromise proposal of the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, will demonstrate the scope of Germany's demands to the world, including absolute equality in armaments and the inclusion of French reservists in the total number of deployable troops. It is reported that the United States will raise serious questions about Germany's demands in Berlin today. It is also reported that Germany is now showing a strong tendency to yield on the issue of real strength. German representative Nadolny said when leaving the meeting this afternoon, "The overall situation has now cleared away the thorns, and we can move forward."</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 13th President Roosevelt and Schacht, President of the Reichsbank, issued a joint statement saying that the World Economic Conference cannot succeed without disarmament. Schacht is a representative of the German government and is currently in Washington meeting with President Roosevelt and others to discuss economic matters.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 13th The German cabinet has decided to convene the Reichstag next Wednesday to hear German Chancellor Hitler's remarks on the situation of the Disarmament Conference. It is reported that Hitler will explain Germany's attitude towards disarmament and deny responsibility for the failure of the Disarmament Conference. The government's announcement of the convening of the Reichstag has attracted great attention in political circles, as it is known that if the Disarmament Conference fails, Germany will face a serious decision, namely, whether to declare the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles invalid based on other countries' refusal to disarm. German Foreign Minister Neurath visited President Hindenburg yesterday afternoon to report on the international political situation. Social Democratic members can attend the Reichstag session. The German government has chosen the Reichstag as the venue for its speech because it can attract greater attention than in Geneva. It is reported that the German Chancellor will also respond to the recent remarks made by British Secretary of State for War Hailsham in the House of Lords. The Germans believe that Hailsham's attacks are more severe than others, so the German government can no longer remain silent.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Washington, 12th The President of the German Central Bank, Schacht, discussed the arms issue with President Roosevelt. Roosevelt explained the US government's views on the matter, saying that the maintenance of peace in Europe depends on the attitude of the United States and Germany. The United States' recognition of participation in the International Consultation Treaty means that the sacrifices made in abandoning traditional diplomatic issues are not small. This consultation treaty is not only beneficial to France, Britain, Belgium, Poland, and the Little Entente countries, but also beneficial to Germany. Germany should also make some sacrifices to ensure the success of the Disarmament Conference. What we hope from Germany is: (1) gradually reduce the national defense force; (2) do not demand the establishment of offensive weapons that Germany does not currently have. Roosevelt further stated that if Germany can change its views, France will agree to gradually reduce offensive weapons. If this is done, in five years, countries will make significant progress on the path of universal disarmament. Roosevelt also urged the German government to consider the situation. Schacht did not agree with Roosevelt's words very much, but promised to report to Chancellor Hitler. This is why Schacht postponed his return to his country.</p>
<p>▲Guomin, Geneva, 12th This afternoon, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson visited German representative Nadolny and agreed that Henderson should suggest to other national representatives that the General Committee should meet on Sunday to discuss Sections 1 and 2 of Part 2 of the British plan, namely, those concerning military strength, war materials, and armaments. This proposal has been accepted by Germany. If the General Committee can adopt it on Sunday, procedural disputes can be eliminated. However, there are still many difficulties in the form and strength of the armies of European countries, as well as their war preparations, which need to be resolved. It is reported that US representative Davis is currently in London working on a compromise plan based on Germany's right to equal treatment.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Geneva, 13th German representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nadolny, declared that he would leave Geneva this afternoon and return to Geneva next Friday after Chancellor Hitler made a declaration on foreign policy in the Reichstag. The Disarmament Conference is now planning to begin a major debate. The holding of this debate was decided by the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference and with Germany's consent. Although Rheinbaben is acting as the German chief representative in the absence of the German chief representative, it is questionable whether this debate can be as effective as expected. Events in Geneva and Berlin next Sunday will have great significance from an international perspective, which is generally recognized.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, 13th US Chief Delegate to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, left London for Geneva at 2 PM this afternoon.</p>

<h3>Austrians Hostile to Germans</h3>
<p>▲Guomin, Vienna, 12th In view of the imminent visit of German government officials and National Socialist Party leaders to Austria, the Austrian government, through its police authorities, has promulgated several rules to ensure that German tourists experience various inconveniences. The Berlin Local Gazette believes that these new rules are hostile to German government officials and says that these regulations are even stricter than the treatment of tourists from enemy countries visiting Austria. For example, the number of people welcoming German guests at the airfield must not exceed twenty, German guests must not make any political speeches, the number of cars accompanying German guests touring Vienna must not exceed ten, and the police should disperse idlers gathering to watch German guests parading through the city. All of these are impolite expressions towards the government of a friendly nation. Furthermore, two of the three gatherings originally planned by Austrian groups during the visit of German dignitaries have now been banned, and the third is limited to its announced purpose, which is to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the relief of Vienna after being besieged by the Turks. However, if the scope of the meeting is temporarily not adhered to, speakers will be prohibited from speaking, and the audience will be dispersed.</p>

<p>The Enemy Army Launches a General Offensive on All Our Routes (Dada)</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting on All Routes in Luandong and Gubeikou</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping, the Japanese army, disregarding world condemnation, has massively invaded Shanhaiguan, plotting to occupy Beiping and Tianjin and complete their North China conspiracy. In recent days, they have actively advanced, and the troops invading Luandong are attempting to cross the Luan River and advance westward. At the same time, large forces have been added to each pass of the Great Wall and launched a general offensive against us today (11th). Their brutal aircraft arbitrarily drop heavy, highly explosive bombs in various cities outside our undefended war zones, disregarding humanity and harming innocent civilians. This morning (11th), planes even arrived in Beiping to scout and disseminate absurd and inflammatory leaflets to pave the way for the invasion of Beiping and Tianjin. Their absolute ambition can be said to be completely exposed at this point, and their mask of deceiving the world is almost completely torn off. The situation in various directions is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Combat Situation on Each Invading Route</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army in Luandong launched a general offensive against us, they divided their forces to invade Funing, Qian'an, Lulong, and Changli. Only a small number of our troops were stationed in Luandong to maintain local security and railway transportation. There were no large armies defending it at first. After the Japanese army successively captured Funing, Qian'an, and Lulong, they planned to attack Changli and further planned to cross the river and advance westward. Our army, according to a predetermined plan, successively concentrated on the original positions on the west bank of the Luan River, defending the river. Only a small number of cavalry were left east of the Luan River for警戒. Yesterday, the Japanese and puppet troops that invaded Lulong pressed towards our Weng Division on the east bank of the Luan River on one side and attacked Changli from the side on the other. Our Changli cavalry was surrounded by the enemy, and after a courageous resistance, they finally broke through. Last night, enemy troops were discovered in Anshan Town, west of Changli, and Anshan Station was also shelled. In order to protect its flanks and consolidate the front, our army's alert troops and armored vehicles withdrew to Shimen Station on the east bank of the Luan River. Today, the Japanese army is still advancing west along the Pingyu Road. Our cavalry on the Beining Line is still fighting the enemy. If necessary, they will retreat across the Luan River Bridge to hold fast to the river. Enemy troops on the upper reaches of the Luan River are currently preparing to advance westward from Qian'an and Lulong and cross the Luan River. Yesterday, a unit of Japanese infantry, under the cover of intense artillery fire, attempted to cross the river and was repelled by our army. Our units in western Luandong have effectively coordinated to prevent the enemy from advancing westward. This morning, fierce fighting is taking place near Shimen, and on the banks of the river in Qian'an and Lulong. The Japanese army's invasion of Luandong this time includes three brigades in addition to the puppet army. Yesterday, two more brigades were transported from Dalian to Qinhuangdao. These two brigades are fresh troops newly transferred from Japan. The Fengshan Road is full of military vehicles, and the transportation of military supplies is very busy. Judging from the situation, they will not stop until they cross the river in a large-scale westward invasion to disturb Beiping and Tianjin. In the Gubeikou area, the enemy recently added a brigade and began to move from the day before yesterday, launching a general offensive against us today (11th). Yesterday evening, the enemy at Nantianmen shelled us fiercely. At 7 PM, two battalions of infantry attacked our positions in Daohuang Village, Yongquan Village, and other places. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Nantianmen. Yongquan Village was bombed by the enemy with incendiary bombs, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. In the Chetouyu area, about 400-500 infantry attacked yesterday afternoon at 6 PM and were repelled by one of our divisions. This morning (11th), the enemy launched a general offensive on all lines against our positions in Xinkailing, Daohuang Village, Shangdianzi, Chetouyu, and other places. The fighting is extremely fierce. As of the time of writing, the fighting is still going on. The enemy attaches great importance to Gubeikou and Xifengkou, preparing to launch a general offensive. Fierce fighting has already broken out in the Luowenyu area this morning, and fighting is also about to break out in other areas. The Japanese army attaches great importance to the Gubeikou and Xifengkou routes, intending to take advantage of this route to raid Beiping and Tianjin and threaten our entire front line in order to achieve its strategic goals quickly.</p>
<h3>Fury of Soldiers at the Front</h3>
<p>The large-scale invasion by the Japanese army was long expected by us. The authorities have had detailed consultations with Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Wan Fulin, He Zhuguo, and others in Beiping regarding the defense plan, and a general agreement has been reached. He Zhuguo returned to defense this morning, and Song, Pang, Shang, and others are also scheduled to go to the front tomorrow to make arrangements. The generals are indignant at the Japanese army's step-by-step advances, making our endurance impossible. Now that we have reached the final juncture, we are determined to fight to the death to defend our territory. Even if only one soldier remains, we will fight to the end. As for the soldiers at the front, they are particularly outraged by the Japanese army's tyranny, and they are sharpening their swords and waiting, preparing to kill the enemy. (11th)</p>
<h3>A General Account of the War in Chahar (Continuation 1) (Special Correspondent Guo An)</h3>
<p>(3) The Situation of the Past Week</p>
<p>The facts have proven that Liu Guitang and others, carrying the banner of Japanese imperialism, occupied Dolon. Following this, they actively moved troops and supplies of military equipment on the vast plains west of Rehe. Needless to say, the enemy's tense movements meant that the order for a general attack on Guyuan would soon be issued. However, although it seemed tense on the surface, in reality, it was only a thousand or so Japanese soldiers driving tens of thousands of our compatriots, those traitors who had lost their minds and souls, to serve as shock troops. At the same time, the enemy's actions this week seemed like a mixture of smoke screens and flares. Although the enemy was playing a bewildering game within the borders of Chahar Province, we can still determine that the Japanese army cannot use large forces. The maximum extent to which they are currently rampant in Chahar and Suiyuan is the puppet army, supplemented by some heavy firearms and advanced weapons such as tanks and airplanes. In any case, the main attacking force is being borne by the puppet army. It is obvious that on that desert-like plain, supplies and drinking water are very scarce, and the Japanese army's objective for the time being does not involve actively occupying Chahar and Suiyuan. Therefore, they are cunningly driving those heartless rebels to go and do it, not caring about their lives or deaths.</p>
<p>The first step of the enemy's plan to attack Chahar, the occupation of Dolon, has been completed. According to the current situation, the main force attacking Guyuan will certainly advance along the Zhangdu Road. It will not avoid the Zhangdu Road and advance west because there is no need for that kind of deep, long-range offensive strategy at the moment. Furthermore, an inner-line attack from Fengning towards Dushikou and Chicheng is also unlikely to happen for the time being because Sun's army is defending the Zhishanling area. If they abandon the plan to attack Guyuan from Dolon and implement an inner-line encirclement and attack, it will clearly result in another stalemate. Unless the troops attacking Guyuan are successful, the inner-line attack plan will commence. Not only will it threaten our troops defending Guyuan, but it will also give the right rear of Zhangjiakou a major blow. However, as the enemy advances south from the Duo-Zhang road, their right flank will inevitably be threatened by mixed cavalry units, forcing our army to retreat to the final defensive line. However, the enemy's attacks have not been fully prepared this week.</p>
<p>Since the enemy entered Dolon, the actions of the puppet rebel army have been completely like those of bandits. In some places, they are even worse than bandits. Therefore, the Japanese army also feels that it is somewhat difficult to command these rebellious and lawless fellows. Therefore, on the one hand, they are reorganizing the system of the rebel army, and on the other hand, they are mobilizing reinforcements. Although the telegrams advertise that the rebel army's advancing attack troops are demonstrating and harassing our army's positions, this action is entirely out of fear of our army's counterattack. Little do they know that those of our defending soldiers at the front are...................</p>
<p>From the time Dolon was lost until now, the area in front of Guyuan has been peaceful. We have gathered no less than 50,000 troops in the Guyuan and Zhangbei areas, with complete infantry, cavalry, and artillery units. Therefore, although the enemy believes that attacking Guyuan from the front is attacking our army's weak point, they cannot but be cautious. Moreover, there is the possibility of a renewed outbreak of the war in Luandong. In this way, the enemy's attempt to attack Chahar may have to be suspended for another three or two weeks. The difficulties that our army is currently experiencing are supplies and transportation equipment. At the same time, the biggest weakness is the lack of unified command. There are all kinds of troops. In name, everyone is united and helping each other, but in reality, everyone is looking out for themselves. Those who cannot fight well will run away first, and those who are slow to run will be unlucky. Wasn't that the case at the beginning of the war in Rehe? Kailu retreated to Chifeng, some surrendered and some ran away, and even those who did not run were scared away by him. The most worrying thing is the troops reorganized from the volunteer army. Although they have been fighting hard for two years and have combat experience, they lack ammunition replenishment and have not received any training. However, although we are worried about this, we also dare to believe that their willingness to sacrifice is great. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Circling Over the City of Beiping and Opening Fire with Machine Guns; Our Authorities Notify All Ambassadors to Protect Nationals</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: The Japanese army, using our military's provocation as a pretext, is once again attacking Luandong. When Ayazawa came to China, he seemed to have intended to plot activities, so his movements were mysterious, probably carrying a mission. However, since our country's attitude was firm and people from all walks of life treated him with indifference, Ayazawa's cunning plan ultimately could not be implemented, and he left in disappointment. Recently, the attitude of the Japanese authorities has changed, and since various countries have remained silent on the recent battle of Rehe and the Great Wall, and the great powers have shown no sign of intervention to this day, the Japanese army's atrocities have become even more unscrupulous. In recent days, Luandong's Funing, Qian'an, Lulong, and Changli areas have fallen into enemy hands, and the situation has suddenly become tense. Its military actions are even more aggressive than the previous attack on Luandong. Heavy fighting has been taking place in the Gubeikou area since last night, with all Japanese troops launching a general offensive, clearly attempting to annex both Beiping and Tianjin. They are advancing step by step, and the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Yesterday, two Japanese planes flew successively to the eastern suburbs of Beiping, outside Chaoyangmen, Sunhe, and Guanyintang, to conduct reconnaissance. Because it was at night, it did not attract public attention. The local authorities received reports at that time and immediately increased vigilance. Air defense facilities had already been prepared, so they ordered all city air defense personnel to mobilize and calmly deploy. The order in the city center remained calm as usual. Today (11th), just after 5:00 AM, the sound of aircraft was suddenly heard again near Chaoyangmen. Two Japanese planes, entirely silver-gray, with the Rising Sun flag painted on their wings, flew from the northeast, passed Dongsi Pailou, and scattered leaflets there, then turned west and flew to Zhongnanhai, circling once above Jurentang, then passed Beihai and flew to Ganshiqiao, firing machine guns downward. At that time, the morning light had not yet risen, and residents in the city were still sound asleep. Only a few vegetable vendors were rushing to the market. The streetlights were still on, and there were few pedestrians. Moreover, the Japanese planes were flying at an altitude of more than 2,700 meters. Machine gun bullets fell from the sky, making sounds as they hit the roof tiles, but because of their weak force, they did not explode. Although eyewitnesses at the time fled in panic, no one was injured. The Japanese planes then flew south to Xidan Pailou, out of Xuanwumen, around Caishikou, and over Tianqiao, flying to Nanyuan, conducting reconnaissance for a long time. Finally, they flew north along the city walls via Zuo'anmen. They did not drop any bombs. After daybreak, rumors had spread throughout the city. There was no significant panic in the city. Many tourists still visited theaters, cinemas, and parks. However, some wealthy families sought refuge in the Legation Quarter or moved to the Tianjin Concession. The number of passengers going to Tianjin at the East Railway Station was more crowded than in the previous two days. When the Japanese planes flew to Beiping, the soldiers guarding Chaoyangmen fired several anti-aircraft guns. Anti-aircraft guns also traced the sky above Jurentang. The Japanese planes, knowing that we were prepared, left in a hurry. Currently, the embassies in the Legation Quarter are paying close attention to this matter and are inquiring with the Japanese Embassy about the truth. Our authorities have already notified all ambassadors to do their best to protect nationals of various countries in Beiping to ensure their safety. Most of the Japanese women and children in the eastern city have been ordered to leave Beiping a few days ago, heading to the Northeast or returning home. The true intentions of the Japanese army are already clear. Furthermore, various municipal schools in Beiping are quite concerned about the safety of the students due to the enemy planes coming to scout and scatter absurd leaflets this morning. Therefore, the principals of various elementary schools sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM today to petition for two things: (1) digging cellars in each school; (2) suspending classes every morning or seeking other appropriate measures. Secretary-General Wu Mangong of the Social Affairs Bureau received them and decided to take responsibility for planning the safety of the students. The cost of digging cellars will be estimated by each school and submitted to the bureau for approval. The issue of suspending classes will be answered after a decision is made with the bureau chief. The representatives left at about 12:00 noon and are actively planning. It is said that various universities in Beiping are also considering starting summer vacation early. (May 11)</p>
<p>Another Civil War Erupts in Sichuan</p>
<h3>The 24th and 28th Armies Clash in Chongqing; the War Zone Spreads, and the Situation Gradually Escalates</h3>
<p>Dispatch from Chongqing: Sichuan warlords Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui, due to conflicts of interest, disregarding everything at a time of national crisis, launched a civil war. After more than three months of fighting, they finally announced the end and temporarily returned to calm. Who knew that the 24th and 28th armies would openly start fighting again on the 5th of this month? The 29th Army has also been drawn into the vortex, and the situation is gradually escalating, with the possibility of affecting the overall situation. The Guizhou war is currently in full swing, and the Sichuan war has started again. Half of the southwest is without a single piece of clean land. The reasons for the re-eruption of the Sichuan war and the recent war situation are summarized below:</p>
<h3>Long-Term Causes of the Re-Eruption of the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>In the previous Sichuan war, the 24th Army designated Wenhui as the target of public criticism, and was besieged by all parties. However, Liu had very flexible skills, and had the power to disintegrate the allied forces. As a result, all parties were still unmoved. Only the 28th Army, under Deng Xihou, feigned cooperation with Liu. In order to save the army from danger and relieve the encirclement, Liu Wenhui instigated all the army's generals to support Deng Xihou as the commander-in-chief of the army, directing military affairs on the front line, and promised to designate Shuangliu and Chongqing counties as Deng's defense area, and also assisted Deng's army with 5 million yuan. However, later, as the war became tight and the 24th Army's front line was in danger, Deng Xihou actually confiscated all the military funds and defense areas, remained stationed and did not move. When Tian Songyao of the 29th Army launched a rebellion and street fighting broke out in Chengdu, the Huang Yimin division and other units of Deng's army sneaked into the 29th Army headquarters, secretly helping Tian's army attack Liu Wenhui, intending to eliminate the 24th Army and solve the problem fundamentally. However, Liu Wenhui, in extreme danger, boosted morale and defeated the 29th Army, driving Tian Songyao out of Chengdu. At this time, Deng Xihou came forward again to mediate, and the two sides ceased fighting and negotiated peace. As a result, the various units of the 29th Army concentrated and launched a counterattack in an unhurried manner, re-enacting street fighting in the provincial capital. The 28th Army not only did not help Liu Wenhui, or declared neutrality, but still sent troops to besiege the 24th Army. At that time, Liu Wenhui, the commander of the 24th Army, and all the generals of the army, hated Deng to the bone. However, because they were surrounded on all sides at the time, they did not dare to compete, and endured and waited for the time to raise an army to question the crime, so they left the root of the disaster for the re-eruption of the Sichuan war.</p>
<h3>Main Forces of the Participating Armies</h3>
<p>This Sichuan war is headed by Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army. Although the 24th Army lost more than half of its defense area after the previous war, its strength was not greatly damaged. After the reorganization of the entire army, there were a total of ten divisions, including the first division commander Zhang Zhihe, the second division commander Lin Yungeng, the third division commander Xia Shoukun, the fourth division commander Tang Yonghui, the fifth division commander Wang Yuanhu, the sixth division commander Chen Hongwen, the seventh division commander Leng Nanxun, the eighth division commander Qing Feiru, the ninth division commander Li Yushu, the tenth division commander Chen Nengfen, the first brigade commander Lai Mutian, the second brigade commander Kang Qiufan, the third brigade commander Huang Ao, the fourth brigade commander Huang Qixian, the fifth brigade commander Liu Wencai, the sixth brigade commander Liu Zhucun, the seventh brigade commander Kou Chengqing, the eighth brigade commander Liu Yuantang, the ninth brigade commander Wang Zhiren, the tenth brigade commander Lin Meipo, the eleventh brigade commander Yang Shangzhou, the twelfth brigade commander Fu Yuanxi, the thirteenth brigade commander Xu Guangpu, the fourteenth brigade commander Zhang Zhifang, the fifteenth brigade commander Yu Zhongying, the sixteenth brigade commander Peng Chengfu, the seventeenth brigade commander Yu Songlin, the eighteenth brigade commander Zhao Peisan, the nineteenth brigade commander Shi Zhaowu, the twentieth brigade commander Mou Guangming, the twenty-first brigade commander Cheng Zimin, the twenty-second brigade commander Huang Xixuan, the twenty-third brigade commander Xiong Cihou, the twenty-fourth brigade commander Gao Binzong, the twenty-fifth brigade commander Su Huazhou, the twenty-sixth brigade commander Duan Kerui, the twenty-seventh brigade commander Zhu Yinzhou, the twenty-eighth brigade commander Yang Zongli, the twenty-ninth brigade commander Chen Ruiting, and the thirtieth brigade commander Mou Suifang. Each division has 10,000 people, totaling 100,000 troops. The defense areas include Huayang, Chongqing, Xinjin, Shuangliu, Qiongzhou, Pujiang, Dayi, Meishan, Pengshan, Danling, Qingshen, Ya'an, Tianquan, Mingshan, Lushan, Rongjing, Hanyuan, Jixing, Jiading, Jiajiang, Hongya, Jianwei, Leibo, Mabian, Emei, Xichang, Mianning, Yuexun, Huili, Yanyuan, Yanbian, Zhaojue, and even 14 counties in Xikang, a total of 47 counties. The 28th Army, under Deng Xihou, which is standing against the 24th Army, did not suffer any major losses in the previous Sichuan war, and instead increased in number, totaling five divisions, including the first division commander Chen Shunong, the second division commander Huang Yin, the third division commander Ma Dezai, the teaching division commander Yang Rongbai, the model division commander Chen Jingshan, the first brigade commander You Guangju, the second brigade commander Wang Xuejiang, the third brigade commander Sun Gongsong, the fourth brigade commander Wang Shijun, the fifth brigade commander Diao Wenjun, the sixth brigade commander Liu Gaohuai, the seventh brigade commander Luo Naifan, the eighth brigade commander Zhou Shiying, the ninth brigade commander Liu Naizhu, the tenth brigade commander Xie Dekan, the eleventh brigade commander Rao Guangyu, the twelfth brigade commander Li Shuhua, the thirteenth brigade commander Gong Weiqing, the fourteenth brigade commander Liu Danwu, and the fifteenth brigade commander Niu Xiguang. Each division has 12,000 people, totaling 60,000 people. The defense areas include Wenjiang, Pixian, Chongning, Guanxian, Xinfan, Guanghan, Xindu, Jintang, Songpan, Lifan, Maogong, Maozhou, Wenchuan, Pengxian, and even three counties in Gansu, totaling 17 counties. As for the 29th Army, under Tian Songyao, which is fully engaged in suppressing bandits in northwestern Sichuan, now that Bazhong, Tongjiang, and Nanjiang have been successively recovered, in addition to handling the aftermath, the entire army has concentrated in Chengdu, preparing to participate in the re-eruption of the Sichuan war, jointly fighting the 24th Army with the 28th Army.</p>
<h3>Immediate Causes of the Re-Eruption of the Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, having suffered significant impact from Deng Xihou in the previous Sichuan war, thought of revenge every day, but had no excuse to use. Previously, Chen Shunong, the commander of the third division of the Sichuan-Kang Army, who was under Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, received 160,000 yuan from Liu every month to maintain the status quo. When the war broke out, Chen Shunong refused to accept Liu Wenhui's orders, remained stationed and did not move, and took the opportunity to seize territory, and publicly declared his separation from the 24th Army and returned to the established system, still under the command of Deng Xihou. Liu Wenhui then used this as an excuse to ask Deng to compensate for the military funds that Chen Shunong had been receiving, and demanded that Chen cede the two counties of Jianyang and Lezhi where he lived, otherwise he would resolve the issue by force. Deng Xihou has always been able to endure humiliation and make concessions to all parties. This time, he uniquely considered Liu's request unreasonable and refused sternly. He also actively engaged in military preparations. Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army then convened a meeting of all army generals to discuss practical solutions. As a result, they all advocated using force against Deng to determine the outcome. Thus, on the 5th of this month, the 5th division commander Wang Yuanhu of the 24th Army and the 2nd division commander Huang Yin of the 28th Army engaged in a direct confrontation in Shiyangchang, Chongqing County. Thus, the Sichuan situation, which had just returned to calm, was disturbed and underwent a major change.</p>
<h3>Recent Battlefield Situation Between the Two Armies</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this Sichuan war, the fighting was limited to within the territory of Chongqing County. There was no movement elsewhere. And the military actions of the two armies in Chongqing County once stopped. The generals of the 24th and 28th armies, who belonged to the Baoding faction, were running around calling for peace and eliminating the civil war. However, both sides insisted on their original purpose and refused to make concessions. On the morning of the 4th, Deng Xihou of the 28th Army openly left the province for Jianyang to deploy military affairs. By the 7th, major battles had broken out between the 24th and 28th armies in Chongqing and Wenjiang, as well as in Jianyang and Renshou. In the end, due to the large number of troops in the 24th Army, superior equipment, and a hundredfold momentum, the 28th Army, outnumbered, announced its retreat. On the 8th, Wang Yuanhu's unit of the 20th Army occupied Wenjiang of the 28th Army. The 24th Army in Renshou also approached Jianyang. Wherever the vanguard went, the 28th Army had no combat capability and collapsed immediately. Deng Xihou was quite panicked. He has now completely concentrated the troops stationed in various garrison areas in Chengdu, Pixian, Guanxian, Jianyang, and other places, preparing to fight the 25th Army to the death. At the same time, he telegraphed and urged Tian Songyao of the 29th Army to quickly send troops to help. Tian has replied and allowed the deployment of three divisions to help. The Zeng Xianlian division has been dispatched to Jianyang, and Wang Mingzhang has been dispatched to Chengdu, ready to provide assistance as needed. The Sichuan war situation is about to expand.</p>
<h3>70 Million People Call for Peace</h3>
<p>The 70 million people of Sichuan have not yet recovered from the previous Sichuan war. The fierce flames of the Red bandits have not stopped causing disturbances. Having survived the disaster, how can they endure another war? When the 24th and 28th armies engaged in a direct confrontation, all parties actively ran around, calling for peace, eliminating the civil war, and jointly resisting foreign aggression. However, the warlords are brave in private fights and do not consider all parties at all, acting willfully, which has aroused public anger. The Great Alliance against Warlord Civil War has been established in Chengdu and Chongqing. Sub-alliances have also been established in various counties, standing on the united front, opposing warlord civil war, resisting donations and taxes, and stopping the supply of military funds, in order to avoid the expansion of the incident. The 70 million people of Sichuan have sent a telegram to the two army commanders Deng and Liu, requesting them to immediately stop military actions, so as not to become public enemies of the Sichuan people and be abandoned by the people of the country. The original telegram read: "To Army Commander Liu of Chengdu, Zigan, and please forward to Army Commander Deng, Jinkang: According to reports, the troops of the two armies have started a civil war in Chongqing Prefecture and have spread to Wenjian, Piguan, and other places, with a tendency to expand. The entire peaceful Sichuan situation has been plunged into a continuous state of war, and the sufferers are our people. As we are currently in a time of serious national crisis, with North China in danger, the Japanese invaders are bound to advance. The Red flames in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Zhejiang are in full swing. All soldiers should concentrate their military strength to resist foreign aggression and appease the country, to fulfill their duties in one in ten thousand ways, and should not launch civil wars, shake the foundations of the country, and leave behind mockery for foreign countries. The two of you are military leaders and pillars of the Party and the country, so we do not hesitate to earnestly persuade you, hoping to arouse your conscience, immediately stop military actions, and jointly maintain the peace of Sichuan. The people will rejoice like drinking sweet dew. A change of mind can achieve this. It is time to rein in at the edge of the cliff. The two of you are wise and should not abandon yourselves to the people of the country and isolate yourselves from the people, becoming public enemies of the 70 million people. The telegram is urgent, and we await your instructions. Sincerely, the 70 million people of Sichuan." (May 11)</p>
<p>The Water Police Headquarters Deploys Defense of the Yangtze River</p>
<h3>The Directors of the Seven Provincial Branches Are Fully Appointed; the Navy Department Allocates Eight Warships to be Received Successively</h3>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: The Water Police Headquarters of the Yangtze River provinces has been established for a long time. Director Jiang Dingwen has also officially taken office. The deployment for the defense of the Yangtze River is extremely strict. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Appointment of Directors of Each Branch</h3>
<p>The provinces under the jurisdiction of the headquarters, from Sichuan, passing through Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, total seven provinces. Branches are set up in each province. Some are reorganized from the Water Police Bureau, and some are recently established. The candidates for the branch directors have been carefully selected. It was not until yesterday (11th) that they were fully appointed. They are: He Beiheng, director of the Sichuan Branch; Xie Liangyu, director of the Hunan Branch; Zhang Ji, director of the Hubei Branch; Li Richeng, director of the Jiangxi Branch; Jiang Yi, director of the Anhui Branch; Shen Baoyi, director of the Jiangsu Branch; Zhejiang has two branches: Ouyang Ge, director of the first branch, managing the outer sea, and Liu Zhihou, director of the second branch, managing the inland river. A temporary maritime patrol team is also set up, with Zhu Songzhou as the team leader.</p>
<h3>Receiving Naval Warships</h3>
<p>The headquarters is responsible for the defense of the river, and the area is vast. In addition to the original gunboats of each province, which are completely under its jurisdiction, Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, has ordered the Navy Department to allocate ten warships for its command and dispatch. The Navy Department, due to insufficient allocation, has temporarily allocated eight ships. Six ships, including Weisheng, Desheng, Guangyun, Hai'ou, Hai'ou, and Lie Ning fish boats, have arrived in Hankou and have been successively received by the headquarters, and water police flags have been added. The Chenzi and Zhangzi boats have not yet arrived in Hankou. Director Jiang Dingwen has ordered the Weisheng and Desheng boats to patrol Changsha. The remaining boats are stationed in various ports upstream and downstream to carry out patrols.</p>
<h3>Drafting the Yangtze River Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Director Jiang Dingwen has recently drafted a complete plan for the river defense of each province, which is extremely detailed. Yesterday, he specifically visited Director He Chengjun to discuss for a long time, exchange views, and planned to call the directors of each provincial branch and the captains of each boat to Hankou in the short term to hold a Yangtze River defense meeting to personally give instructions. Also, due to the lack of water police personnel, it was decided to set up a water police training school, which has been submitted to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for approval. The number of students, the length of the course, the subjects, and the budget are all in the plan. As soon as it is determined, the recruitment of water police students will begin, and training will be carried out. (May 12)</p>
<h3>Amateur Sports Games of the People of Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The county stadium held a two-day amateur sports game for the people starting today (13th). A total of 147 athletes from various people's education centers participated. The opening ceremony was held at 9:00 AM today. County Magistrate Jin sent representative Secretary Han Yuansheng to preside over the ceremony. The sports activities started at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. In addition to track and field, ball games, and all-around sports, there were also tug-of-war, 200-meter pole carrying finals, free bike slow race finals, 50-meter literacy finals, and national skills. It ended at 5:00 PM. There are also competitions in the morning and afternoon tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Changshu Police Officer Commits Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>The 7th District Weijiatang is stationed with two squads of police. On the 12th of this month, there was a celebration for welcoming the gods. All the police officers in the team went out to maintain order. Only one sentry and Wu Huanzao, who was sick, were left in the team. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 PM, the police officer on duty at the gate suddenly heard a gunshot from inside. He went in to check but found no one. Then he went to Wu's sickbed and saw bloodstains on his chest, a gun lying upside down in the corner of the bed. Wu had died. He rushed to report to the squad leader and others who returned. They then reported to the headquarters in the city, and Chief Wang reported to the county government, which sent an inspector to the countryside to inspect. The inspection found that Wu Huanzao had bullet holes in his chest and back. The bullet entered from the chest and came out of the back. It was indeed suicide. The team then sent someone to take care of the burial and notified the family to come to Changshu to collect the coffin.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Bandits Are Arrested in Hupu</h3>
<p>Hupu in this county is located on the riverbank, and bandits can easily sneak in. Recently, because the fish season has arrived, many people from other places have come to the town. Yang Kun, the director of the local public security sub-bureau, was still worried that bandits might be mixed in, so he joined forces with Tang Yingxi, the company commander of the provincial security team stationed in the town, and others to carry out a large search starting on the 10th. Xia Delin and 23 others were arrested in the Dongtangxi area. According to the townspeople's guarantee, 17 of them were released on bail and deported. Xu Nanda, Xia Delin, Dong Jingshan, Yao Liangsheng, Sun Jisheng, and others were indeed identified as bandits and were escorted to the city on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Excavation of Ancient Tombs in Suzhou</h3>
<p>In the Xietang township of Wu County, there is an ancient tomb of Zhang Shicheng, the King of Gusu at the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty. It is said that there are many funerary objects in the tomb. Recently, Mao Jinhe, a local tyrant in the township, hired many stonemasons and secretly excavated the tomb. Zou Xiaogong, the magistrate of Wu County, learned about this and believed that the tomb has a history of more than 500 years and should not be excavated. He ordered the Xietang District Office yesterday (13th) to strictly stop it, investigate the excavation situation, and report in detail for review.</p>
<h3>Sheng's Lingering Garden to Be Opened as a Park</h3>
<p>Sheng's Lingering Garden on Wufu Road has been managed by the county government since Sheng's property was sealed up. It has now been ordered to be returned. After Magistrate Zou contacted Sheng's representatives, it was decided that the garden would be returned to Sheng's on the 18th of this month. It is also learned that local people here have sent a letter to Sheng's, requesting that the Lingering Garden be opened as a park. Sheng's is currently considering this matter and it may become a reality.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Scouts Begin Large-Scale Camping</h3>
<p>The county-wide scout review and large-scale camping began on the 12th. At 2:00 PM, the schools took the lead with their blue team flags and slogans, departing from the schools. Those with baggage traveled by ox cart. Hundreds of athletes marched with great spirit all the way. When they arrived at the campsite under Baoshan Bridge in Huishan, they set up white tents, dug pits and buried pots, carried water and washed, and erected camp gates. The work was extremely busy. The schools that reported to the campsite included the county junior high school, the provincial junior high school attached elementary school, the Hu's junior high school, the civil vocational school, the Tonghuijiao elementary school, the Guangqin elementary school 2, the county party headquarters, and others. Those participating from other places included Changshu County Junior High School and Shimei Elementary School, a total of 47 schools. The camp facilities included a wireless radio, alarm bells, electric lights, a general camp, and a camp public security bureau, a rescue team, a news agency, and a store. The headquarters was set up in Huishan Park, with a bicycle communication team to transmit news. The organization was extremely meticulous. At about 8:00 PM that evening, a group leader talk was held. Yesterday (13th) morning, a scout rule story speech contest and course competition were held. The afternoon was a preparation review, and the evening was an anti-Japanese national salvation speech contest. The 14th was a morning course competition, a morning review ceremony, an afternoon course competition, and a camp station conference in the evening. On the morning of the 15th, there was a memorial week for the Prime Minister, a course performance, and an opening ceremony in the afternoon. The camp was broken at 6:00. Many trophies such as silver spires, silver shields, and silk flags were awarded by various agencies, groups, and newspapers. Zhang Zhongren, director of the preparatory committee of the China Boy Scout General Association, and Secretary Wang of the Ministry of Railways, came to Wuxi the night before to visit. Sun Yuanliang, commander of the 88th Division of the National Army, also arrived by train from the Danyang defense area last night for the review.</p>
<h3>The Responsibility for the Purchase of Defective Weapons in Nantong is Clear</h3>
<p>The self-defense weapons purchased in Nantong, including 40 submachine guns, were reported by Wu Jianzhang, a member of the county executive and supervisory committee, as being made of scrap materials. The newly appointed county magistrate, Ye Zhendong, verified that they were indeed useless and defective. All sectors of the local community were shocked. County Magistrate Ye noted that the handover file only had a note for 18,000 yuan issued by the former county magistrate Zhang Su, with no receipts. He sent a letter to Zhang on the 12th, requesting a detailed reply on the inside story of the case.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Special Defense Donation Loan Certificates</h3>
<p>The County Defense Council, because the income from defense donations was too slow, requested a resolution from the County Council to issue 40,000 yuan of special defense donation loan certificates on June 1. The certificate holders were allowed to cash out at a 97% discount. The certificates were divided into 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan denominations. In March of next year, they will be cashed out at full face value.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou and Zhejiang Province Have Excellent Silkworm Crops</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department designated Xiaoshan and Lin'an counties as model silkworm mulberry areas for improving silk. A disturbance occurred earlier this month due to a misunderstanding among the villagers. The matter was properly handled and quickly subsided. It is now learned that the first model area in Xiaoshan sold 130,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs this year. Most of the silkworms are now in their fourth instar. The silkworm crops are excellent. It is estimated that cocoons will be harvested around the 25th of this month. It is estimated that the entire area will harvest 27,000 piculs of fresh cocoons. In addition, the second model area in Lin'an sold more than 7,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs. The silkworms are currently in their third instar. The cocoons will be harvested by the end of this month. If the weather does not change much, it is estimated that more than 18,000 piculs of fresh cocoons will be harvested. The silkworm crops in the improved areas of Hangxian, Haining, Jiaxing, and Haiyan are also excellent. The cocoon merchants in various counties are preparing to open the market.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Following the recent anti-Chinese surge in Mexico, overseas Chinese in Mexico have successively returned to China after much hardship. Upon investigation, these distressed overseas Chinese had all their properties confiscated by the Mexican government before their hasty departure, leaving them penniless and in a truly pitiful state. Previously, representatives of these distressed overseas Chinese, such as Li Kuan and others, reported to this government about their expulsion, and the situation of over two hundred distressed overseas Chinese awaiting assistance in Shanghai. This government has requested local organizations in this city to provide relief. Now, we have received another report that an additional forty-nine distressed overseas Chinese, including Lin Huiyao and others, urgently require assistance, making the situation quite pressing. We remember that these distressed overseas Chinese, while doing business overseas, have always generously contributed to disaster relief and resistance against foreign aggression within the country. They were, in the past, patriotic overseas Chinese. Now, due to expulsion, they are all victims who cannot return to their homes. Your esteemed association embraces their suffering and holds charity in your hearts. Recalling past contributions and emulating patriotism, please make every effort to provide relief to these overseas Chinese passing through Shanghai, enabling them to return to their respective hometowns. Your benevolence will spread far and wide and will be admired by overseas Chinese everywhere. We are sending this special letter and hope to receive a reply.</p>
<h3>Dumping Goods Review Committee Sets Up Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Conducting Investigation into Foreign Goods Dumping Situation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, recognizing that the dumping policy of foreign goods has greatly impacted China's industry and commerce, have established a Dumping Goods Review Committee to prevent this. The committee plans to collect dumping duties and has dispatched commissioners to various provinces and cities to investigate the dumping situation of foreign goods. A Shanghai office has been established at the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance on the Bund, Sanma Road, to facilitate investigations and provide a convenient point of contact for all sectors.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing Central Government Affairs and Borderland Situation</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and is scheduled to return to Nanjing by overnight train tonight. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Chu at his residence yesterday morning and inquired about the current situation in Xinjiang and various issues such as rural revitalization. He provided the following detailed answers:</p>
<p>Xinjiang is Calm According to Mr. Chu, the Xinjiang incident has now calmed down. The Xinjiang authorities previously dispatched Chen Zhong via Russia to Beijing to report on the current situation in Xinjiang and seek instructions on how to handle the situation. While traveling to Moscow, Chen learned that the central government had already formulated a plan for handling the Xinjiang incident and had appointed Huang Musong as the Pacification Commissioner to go to Xinjiang to offer condolences. Chen then returned to Xinjiang, conveying the intentions and plan of the central government to the people. The Hui people have always been obedient to the central government and decided to quietly await the arrival of Pacification Commissioner Huang to handle the situation. Pacification Commissioner Huang is scheduled to depart for Xinjiang next week. The group accompanying him consists of more than twenty people. It has not yet been decided whether they will fly to Xinjiang or travel via Siberia. As for the suggestion of the China Hui Culture Promotion Association to organize a new investigation committee, it seems feasible in order to resolve the Xinjiang incident as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Guizhou Internal Strife Liu Wenhui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, has recently had a rift with Deng Xihou, commander of the Twenty-eighth Army. Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government, also has conflicts with You Guocai, commander of the Third Division stationed in Guizhou. Troops are currently being mobilized, and war clouds are gathering in Sichuan and Guizhou, with the potential for an imminent outbreak. At this time of serious national crisis, it is regrettable that internal strife is still occurring in Sichuan and Guizhou. The central government has sent separate telegrams to strictly stop the conflict and is awaiting the central government’s investigation and resolution.</p>
<p>Rural Revitalization Regarding the issue of revitalizing the rural economy, the Executive Yuan held a meeting in Beijing yesterday morning (the 12th) to discuss the outline of the implementation plan. In the future, it is planned to organize a specialized committee to study various issues such as improving agricultural implements and to establish associations in various provinces to be specifically responsible for implementation. The Executive Yuan will also hold daily meetings to discuss the issue of revitalizing the rural economy. As for the collateral for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang silk industry public bond, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry are still in discussion and have not yet made a decision.</p>

<h3>French Government Awards Medal to Qian Xinzhi</h3>
<p>French Consul General Méléaud Represents Award</p>
<p>Qian Xinzhi, General Manager of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, has served as Vice Chairman of the Sino-French Bank for fifteen years. His planning and management have greatly benefited Sino-French trade and economy. In order to reward Qian Xinzhi for his service, the French government awarded him a medal. The medal arrived in Shanghai some days ago, and the award ceremony was held at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund at 1 p.m. yesterday. At the same time, a luncheon was held there, and Mayor Wu, Kong Xiangxi, Li Shizeng, and other important Chinese and foreign figures were invited to attend.</p>
<p>Guests Present</p>
<p>The important Chinese and foreign figures who were invited to attend and accompany the ceremony yesterday afternoon included: Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Central Supervisory Committee member Li Shizeng, Governor of the Central Bank Kong Xiangxi, Executive Yuan Secretary Chu Minyi, former League of Nations Secretary Wu Kaisheng, banking representatives Xu Xinliu, Li Fusun, Yu Zuoting, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunzhai; and from the French side, French Consul General Méléaud, Consul Delaquérière, Sino-French Bank Manager Barre, and other relevant foreigners, totaling more than thirty people.</p>
<p>Award Ceremony</p>
<p>The award ceremony was quite simple. After the Chinese and foreign guests arrived, champagne was first served. Then, at precisely 1 p.m., French Consul General Méléaud addressed the audience, saying, "The French government believes that Mr. Qian Xinzhi has made significant contributions to Sino-French economic cooperation, and therefore specifically instructs this Consul General to represent and award him a higher-level medal." After speaking, he presented the medal and pinned it on Qian's chest, and raised a glass to congratulate him. Then, Sino-French Bank Manager Barre delivered a congratulatory speech, and Qian's reply was translated by Liu Xichang, Secretary of the Sino-French Education Foundation. At 1:15 p.m., the ceremony was announced as complete. After the crowd raised their glasses once more to congratulate him, they proceeded to sit down for lunch. Guests and hosts enjoyed the banquet, which dispersed at 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Barre’s Speech</p>
<p>Sino-French Bank Manager Barre said in his speech, "Today, the Chinese guests participating in the award ceremony are all close friends of Mr. Qian Xinzhi. In addition, there are well-known French figures who have long been friendly to China who have also honored us with their presence. The French government has entrusted Consul Méléaud in Shanghai to present Mr. Qian Xinzhi with this medal of honor to express its admiration. I dare to believe that I can represent all of you in offering the most sincere congratulations to Mr. Qian Xinzhi. Our bank's Chairman Guo Ya Jun and General Manager Galé also sent telegrams entrusting me to congratulate Mr. Qian Xinzhi. I would like to take this opportunity to say to you that our bank's operations in China have a special situation. At the beginning of its establishment, the Chinese government sponsored this initiative and participated in the share capital. Therefore, there are also Chinese people on the board of directors. Mr. Qian Xinzhi is the Vice Chairman of our bank's board of directors and concurrently holds the position of Chinese General Manager, which shows the participation of China. In fact, it is Sino-French economic cooperation. In 1931, our bank in North China once implemented this kind of economic cooperation with major Chinese banks, but it was not important. Since then, there has been no action of any kind. The reason is the current worldwide economic panic. All banks have to engage in austerity and restrict lending. What we hope now is that this kind of economic panic will end soon, so that our bank can continue to carry out economic cooperation with major Chinese banks. Mr. Qian Xinzhi is a well-known figure in the Chinese financial community. He will be able to combine the Chinese banks and our bank, so that Sino-French economic cooperation can be implemented. Now, please raise your glasses to congratulate Mr. Qian."</p>
<p>Qian's Reply</p>
<p>Consul General and gentlemen, I am honored and extremely grateful to receive the medal from the French government through Consul General Méléaud. Please ask Consul General Méléaud to convey my gratitude to the French government. I am also deeply moved by Mr. Barre's compliments and praise, and I am also grateful for the congratulations entrusted by Chairman Guo Ya Jun and General Manager Galé. Please also ask Mr. Barre to convey my gratitude to Mr. Guo and Mr. Galé. Since the Chinese government assisted in the establishment of our bank, the inherent economic relationship between China and France has relied on the wisdom of Mr. Guo Ya Jun, Mr. Galé, Mr. Barre, and other famous figures, who have helped each other and allowed it to develop day by day. As for my personal aspect, the honorable President can firmly believe that I will do my best in the future to continue the Sino-French economic cooperation policy. This is my duty. Today I have this good opportunity to raise a glass with you all to wish the Republic of France prosperity and Consul General Méléaud and President Barre good health.</p>
<h3>Dong and Cai Talk After Model Prison is Accused</h3>
<p>The Caohejing Jiangsu Second Model Prison is very large and currently holds more than 2,000 prisoners, most of whom are political prisoners. Recently, the prison has been accused of being corrupt and inefficient, leading to dissatisfaction among the prisoners. Some days ago, prisoners Wang Jiaxiang, Lü Zongrui, and others specifically entrusted lawyer Dong Kang to present all the illegal and corrupt practices of the prison to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting a thorough investigation and reform. Since lawyer Dong's petition was published in the newspapers, it has attracted great attention from all sectors of society. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, considering that this matter concerns national legal system and human rights protection, specifically visited Mr. Dong Shoujing and Mr. Cai Ziming yesterday and received the following information:</p>
<h3>Dong Shoujing Talks</h3>
<p>The entrustment of this petition on behalf of Wang, Lü, and others is entirely due to the excessive and illegal ill-treatment they have suffered, and the appeal of Wang, Lü, and a few others can also be said to be the cry of all prisoners. Recently, there have been many rumors about prison corruption, so not long ago, I advised Wang Yuanzeng, Director of the Prison Affairs Department of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, in a personal capacity, to pay attention to the thorough investigation. It would be best to live with the prisoners for a week to fully understand the true situation in the prison. Mr. Wang agreed at the time. When I served as a prison official for two years during the Guangxu years 28 and 29, I was deeply aware of the darkness of our country's prisons. The extreme cruelty of the prison guards and jailers is truly indescribable. Therefore, when I later served in the judicial field, I made every effort to improve the situation. I visited prisons in Japan, Europe, and the United States, and everything was like heaven and earth compared to our country. In short, this problem is related to the entire national politics. If the politics are bad, the society will deteriorate, and there will be many lawbreakers, and the law enforcers will be in the same proportion. These are not local problems. I once saw a prison official in Suzhou who was young and did not know what the law was, but his actions were luxurious, none could surpass him. Later, I learned that this person was originally a relative of Wei Mingjun, the then Minister of Judicial Administration. At this point, I realized that officials today regard prison positions as lucrative jobs. If this is the case, how can we seek prison reform? However, this is just one aspect of the matter. Although I was entrusted with this petition by the prisoners due to my professional relationship, whether the allegations are true needs to be thoroughly investigated by the authorities. In my opinion, the corruption may be even worse than described in the petition. The lawyers' association will organize a prison inspection team, which is a mission that they should have in their profession. I have also heard that some members of the press have launched a reporter visit group. I think there is no need for excessive publicity, which would prevent the authorities from taking action. The Caohejing Prison Director has sent a letter to various newspapers, saying that the request should be based on facts and public opinion. This is very good. We will wait quietly for the true investigation and deeply hope that the authorities will correct their mistakes if they have them, and be more vigilant if they do not.</p>
<h3>Cai Jiemin Talks</h3>
<p>I have only seen Dong's lawyer's petition on behalf of the prisoners in the newspaper. Whether the allegations are true still needs to be investigated before a conclusion can be drawn. The charter of the Civil Rights Protection League originally stipulated the task of investigating prisons throughout the country. It was implemented once in Beiping. The lawyers' association will hold an inspection of Caohejing Prison, and the Civil Rights Protection League may not participate. As for when the League itself will investigate, it has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Talks About the Concession Factory Inspection Issue</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Will Reply in Writing Within Days</p>
<p>It Will Not Tend to Extremes and Can Be Resolved by Compromise</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the right to inspect factories in the Public Concession, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun previously visited Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden to discuss the matter. According to Secretary-General Yu, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, he explained the attitude of the Chinese government to Mr. Fessenden. The Chinese government will not give up its sovereignty over the inspection of factories. If the Municipal Council ignores everything and implements inspections, it will be opposed by public opinion, and the Municipal Council will not be able to proceed smoothly. However, the Chinese government still hopes that the Municipal Council can assist in the process, adhering to the principle of not hindering Chinese sovereignty. Mr. Fessenden expressed sympathy for his statement and promised to consider it within a few days and reply in writing. According to Mr. Yu's observation, the Municipal Council will not always tend to extremes on this matter and a compromise can be reached.</p>
<h3>Lin Wo Jiang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Aviation Construction Association Scheduled to be Established on the 20th</h3>
<p>Lin Wo Jiang, Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, was summoned to Beijing by telegram by Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the National Aviation Construction Association, on Monday (the 8th), and took the night train to Beijing to assist in preparing for the establishment of the Aviation Construction Association. The preparations have now been completed. He left Beijing by night train the night before and arrived in Shanghai at 8 a.m. yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited him at the Aviation Association yesterday afternoon and inquired about the recent progress of the establishment of the Aviation Construction Association and the Aviation Association's purchase of aircraft. Mr. Lin replied as follows:</p>
<p>Tasks of the Construction Association</p>
<p>The National Aviation Construction Association is an agency for fundraising, custody, and design, directly under the Executive Yuan. The government hires forty central committee members and leading figures from all walks of life and aviation personnel as directors, and appoints Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, Qian Xinzhi, Shi Liangcai, and Ge Jingen as managing directors. Mr. Ge also serves as Secretary-General and is responsible for preparations. I am also a director. I went to Beijing on Monday at the summons of Director Ge and returned only yesterday. I spent four days in Beijing, assisting Director Ge in preparing for the establishment and drafting articles of association and proposals, which have been completed. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in Nanjing on the morning of the 20th. The association's office will be located at the original site of the Nanjing Aviation Administration (the Aviation Administration has now moved to Hangzhou). I will take the other directors from Shanghai to Beijing on the 19th to attend the inaugural meeting.</p>
<p>Aircraft Purchase Awaiting Funds</p>
<p>The Aviation Association has initially ordered twelve fighter jets. Since my last trip to Beijing to contact Vice Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, the type and configuration of the aircraft have been determined and will be ordered soon. However, the required funds are still insufficient from what has been raised in the city. The Shanghai Solicitation Team is working hard under the leadership of Mayor Wu, and although the results have only reached half of the intended goal, we feel that most of the donors are from the middle and lower classes. Getting this million is not easy. With Shanghai, a city concentrated with wealthy families, but the rich donate less, no wonder the income is not much. The extension has now been extended for one month. During this month, the Solicitation Team will focus its efforts on soliciting donations from the rich. The national situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the rich are certainly not ignorant of patriotism. A slight reduction in waste is already considerable. It is expected that the results obtained this month will exceed two million.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Health Section Chief Rajchman Returned to Europe Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rajchman, Chief of the Health Section of the League of Nations, previously accompanied Chinese Committee Member Li Shizeng to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss matters related to China's health construction. After completing his official duties and returning to Beijing, he traveled to Shanghai with Li Shizeng, Liu Ruiheng, and others the day before. Mr. Rajchman's mission in China has been completed, and he took a boat to return to Europe yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Aviation Patriotic Fund Raising – Boy Scouts Mobilization Day 2</h3>
<p>General Captain Personally Inspects, Results Still Good</p>
<p>The city's Boy Scouts set out to raise funds for the aviation patriotic fund. Yesterday was the second day. Boy Scout General Captain Tong Xingbai also personally went out to inspect. The details of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Patriotic citizens, do not disappoint the enthusiasm of the Boy Scouts, actively donate to the aviation patriotic fund.</p>
<p>Fundraising Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 50 Boy Scout troops, totaling approximately 3,000 people, continued to divide into groups and go to various streets, markets, hotels, theaters, and other places where people gather, using kind words to persuade and raise funds widely. The situation was quite enthusiastic, and the results obtained were also quite considerable. Yesterday, it was heard that the Southeast First Troop had already received more than a thousand yuan. The other troops are also working tirelessly, going out day and night, and the results obtained should also be considerable. Many of those who responded to the fundraising were moved by the Boy Scouts' service to society and enthusiasm for national affairs, and they generously donated. One person, upon encountering Boy Scouts who were soliciting donations, immediately donated fifty gold coins without hesitation, and his enthusiasm was commendable.</p>
<p>Captain’s Inspection</p>
<p>Boy Scout Fundraising Team General Captain Tong Xingbai, accompanied by Director Wang Gang of the Board of Directors, took a car to tour various roads at 2 p.m. yesterday, personally inspecting the fundraising situation of various small teams, and promptly notified each team leader to pay attention to the traffic of military vehicles to avoid hindering traffic order. The small teams were also quite cautious in handling matters, so the result was very satisfactory.</p>

<h3>利成輪昨晨出險</h3>
<p>Arrived Safely in Quanzhou to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>Only One Hold Took on Water</p>
<p>The Richeng vessel of the Yongyuan Shipping Company, which encountered a reef outside Quanzhou around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, was reported in yesterday's newspaper.

<h3>宋慶齡等昨向德領館抗議</h3>
<p>Song Qingling and Others Protested at the German Consulate Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding Germany's Oppression of Civil Rights and Destruction of Culture</p>
<p>The China League for Civil Rights Protection, with the aim of promoting civil rights, regardless of international boundaries, has recently noted that since the rise to power of the Hitler faction in Germany, with its one-party dictatorship, innocent people have been persecuted, scholars have been oppressed, and the cruelty has been extreme. Therefore, yesterday (the 13th) morning, the Executive Committee, consisting of Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Lu Xun, and others, personally went to the German Consulate in this city to lodge a protest. They were received by Vice-Consul Mr. Bei Lian, who promised to forward the protest to the German Minister to China. The original text of the protest is as follows:</p>
<p>This League, based on reports in newspapers from various countries, has learned that since the Fascist Party came to power, the number of arrested workers has reached 30,000 to 40,000, while thousands of intellectuals have been subjected to oppression. Prisoners are subjected to brutal torture or killed, and afterwards it is falsely claimed that they committed suicide or were shot while attempting to escape. Corpses are frequently found in forests and rivers. Workers' organizations have been disbanded, and their property confiscated. Writers and scholars, due to their Jewish ethnicity or leftist political views, have been repeatedly subjected to various forms of humiliation. Scientists such as Einstein and Hirschfeld have been forced to leave the country. Famous writers, such as Ludwig Reun, Leon Feuchtwanger, and Thomas Mann, have either been forced to leave the country or subjected to extreme humiliation. The homes of great artists, such as Max Liebermann, and musicians, such as Bruno Walter, have been ransacked, and their manuscripts burned. The dark deeds of the Middle Ages in persecuting scientists, and the burning of books two thousand years ago, have unexpectedly reappeared today. Freedom of publication and speech has been completely deprived. Even journals of discussion, art, and literature, such as Weltbuehne, have been banned. The most right-wing New York Times (March 15th, 20th, and 21st) also reported the following: "The Vienna newspapers daily carry stories of the brutal torture of Communist, Socialist, Progressive, and Jewish members of parliament, journalists, writers, and lawyers." (Sollmann) "Beaten unconscious, ribs broken, and then their feet burned with fire. After waking up, they are beaten again." The teeth of the famous columnist "Ossietzky" were "knocked out with a pistol." "Heinz Pohl's novel manuscript was torn up and he was ordered to swallow it... In prison camps, prisoners are forced to fight each other until they pass out. In some cases, fathers and sons are forced to fight each other... Corpses are often found in the forests near Berlin every morning. Last week, three corpses were found in one day..." The above facts have been repeatedly reported in various newspapers of different political persuasions in Europe and America and are by no means one-sided accounts. This League believes that such inhumane acts not only trample on human rights but also oppress innocent scholars and writers, which is tantamount to destroying German culture. In the interests of humanity and the progress of society and culture, we hereby lodge the most serious protest.</p>
<h3>黔同鄕會接王家烈電</h3>
<p>Guizhou Native Association Receives Telegram from Wang Jialie</p>
<p>Reporting that the Situation in Guizhou Has Been Stabilized</p>
<p>According to Hua Dong News Agency, the recent outbreak of conflict in Guizhou has attracted widespread attention. The Guizhou Native Association has obtained a telegram from Wang Jialie, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government, as follows: (omitted above) "The situation in Guizhou is shattered and cannot withstand further disturbances. Therefore, I, Jialie, have resolved to step down in the hope of achieving peace and ending the situation in Guizhou. Jiang Zaizhen's troops, after being directed by me, Jialie, to be temporarily stationed and reorganized in Houping and Yanhe, repeatedly received orders from the Central Government to proceed elsewhere, but they defied orders and instead gathered their forces to launch a fierce attack on Songtao, advancing to Zunyi, which led to a conflict with Tie Jian's (Hou Zhidan's) troops. The peace in Guizhou has been hindered. Thinking of the national crisis, I am deeply pained. According to a telegram from Commander Liao Huaichong, after defeating these troops in Lou Mountain Pass and Banqiao, Zunyi was recovered at noon on the Yang day. Jiang's forces numbered only 2,000. Apart from the casualties and prisoners, the remaining 200 to 300 men were routed. Jiang, knowing that the situation was hopeless, secretly fled without a trace on the Ma night. In addition to dispatching teams to arrest him strictly in order to completely eliminate him, I respectfully report the above details by telegram." I immediately sent telegrams ordering the commanders to swiftly conclude military operations and stabilize the region. I specifically report this information to you by telegram. I express my respect and gratitude. (Signed) Wang Jialie, with his seal affixed.</p>

<h3>機件續到</h3>

Yesterday, the fourth batch arrived from the United Kingdom. According to the station, the four batches of large and small machines that have arrived so far total 1,500 pieces, most of which are for external applications. The remaining internal application components are currently being shipped and are expected to be fully delivered by the end of July.</p>
<h3>添建鐵塔</h3>

<h3>年底通報</h3>
<p>Communication by Year's End</p>
<p>The station considers that its existing buildings are insufficient for Sino-British communication, so it is adding several buildings in Zhenru to house the Sino-British communication equipment. Since construction began, the external works have been largely completed. The equipment shipped from the UK is expected to be installed starting at the end of July and completed by mid-September. The clarity of the signal will need to be tested for one or two months, so the communication period is expected to be no earlier than the end of the year.</p>

<p>市輪渡每逢夏季、乘客特别擁擠、均以滬上人士赴浦東鄕郊游覽者居多、所備渡輪、不敷應用、内赴浦東高橋者、均由滬陸續前往、旁晚整批返滬、倘阻其登輪、則一部分乘客、勢將無法返滬、應付殊感困難、公用局有鑒於此、曾經計劃更大更快渡輪一艘、以資補救、但因種種關係、開工較遲、本年夏季、不能完成、故另行設法、自本星期日（五月十四日）起、將上午五時三十分、由高橋開上海之一班、及原有末班下午六時三十分、改爲下午七時十分、由高橋開上海之一班、均用兩輪、同時行駛、以免擁塞、此項辦法、業由公用局輪渡總管理處、用中西文發出通告云、</p>
<p>The city ferry is particularly crowded every summer, mostly due to people from Shanghai visiting the countryside of Pudong. The available ferries are insufficient to meet the demand. Those going to Gaoqiao in Pudong travel continuously from Shanghai and return in batches in the evening. If they are prevented from boarding, some passengers will be unable to return to Shanghai, making it difficult to cope. In view of this, the Public Utilities Bureau had planned a larger and faster ferry to remedy the situation, but due to various reasons, the start of construction was delayed and it will not be completed this summer. Therefore, other measures have been taken. Starting from this Sunday (May 14), the 5:30 AM ferry from Gaoqiao to Shanghai and the original last ferry at 6:30 PM will be changed to 7:10 PM, and the ferry from Gaoqiao to Shanghai will use two ferries running simultaneously to avoid congestion. The Public Utilities Bureau's Ferry Management Office has issued a notice in Chinese and Western languages about this measure.</p>

<p>The French Concession authorities have recently ordered that all prostitutes in brothels within the concession be examined by doctors in order to prevent the spread of syphilis, as previously reported. The French police issued a notice yesterday, along with sanitary regulations for prostitutes working in brothels, and sent detectives to distribute them to all brothels. The contents are transcribed below: Notice: (1) Prostitutes working in brothels must undergo regular medical examinations in the future to prevent the spread of syphilis or other infectious diseases. (2) The French Municipal Council will appoint doctors to conduct regular examinations, which will also be inspected by the police. (3) Each prostitute will be given a special booklet with her photo and the results and date of her last examination. Customers can request to see this booklet so they can determine the current health status of the prostitutes in the brothel. (4) Brothel owners are not allowed to hire women from outside the brothel, or prostitutes without a license or whose licenses have been revoked by the police. (5) Customers should refuse any woman who cannot produce her required police license and should report to the police if the prostitute refuses to present her license. (Sanitary Regulations for Prostitutes Working in Brothels) (1) Brothel owners are prohibited from hiring or harboring prostitutes suffering from infectious diseases. (2) The Commissioner of Police may order a doctor to examine the prostitutes in the brothel at any time. (3) If a prostitute is found to have an infectious disease, the police may immediately revoke her license and fine the brothel owner five to fifty yuan for each infected prostitute. If there are repeated offenses, the police may close the brothel. It is essential for women in brothels to undergo medical examinations to prevent the spread of syphilis. Therefore, brothel owners should pay particular attention to the hygiene of their residents and ensure that their bodies are thoroughly clean. If customers contract an illness there, it will damage the brothel's reputation. Prostitutes should immediately inform their owners when they are ill. In addition to the scheduled examination days, they can also consult doctors for advice on prevention if they encounter any difficulties. The method of hygiene is very simple and can often be achieved by disinfecting or washing with wound-healing medicines, which can prevent the transmission of many diseases. However, brothel owners must urge their prostitutes to wash diligently and must not allow prostitutes who appear to be infected or unclean to delay medical examinations.</p>
<h3>先致壽儀二金繼卽開槍殺人</h3>
<p>Presented Birthday Gifts of Two Dollars First, Then Opened Fire and Killed</p>
<p>顧道生爲岳父做壽送命</p>
<p>Gu Daosheng Gave His Life for His Father-in-Law's Birthday Celebration</p>
<p>兇手孫殿臣在旅館被逮</p>
<p>The Murderer Sun Dianchen Was Arrested in a Hotel</p>
<p>Gu Daosheng, also known as Yuesheng, age 27, from Nanxiang, the son-in-law of Jin Liuting, a blind man from Jiaxing who lives at No. 277 Wangjia Wharf in Nanshi and works as a fortune teller, used to be a boatman, but now works as a dock insurance cargo watcher. On March 26th of this year, for the 60th birthday of his father-in-law, Jin Liuting, Gu booked the Dajilou restaurant at No. 57 Xiaodongmen Street in the French Concession to hold a birthday banquet. That afternoon, suddenly, an intruder, pretending to be delivering gifts, entered the door at 4:20 PM and exchanged a few words of pleasantries with Gu, then handed him two dollars as a gift, turned around and went outside. Gu escorted him to the second doorway, and the guest turned around, pulled out a pistol, and fired at Gu, fatally wounding him. The murderer escaped on the spot. Later, the police took the body in a hearse for an autopsy. After the court confirmed the cause of death, the widow, Gu Jinshi, signed for the body to be collected and buried, while the police investigated and apprehended the murderer. Now, Jin Jiulin, a detective supervisor from the French police, and Zhang Ziying, a police detective, have found that the murderer of Gu is Sun Dianchen, from Jiangbei, who is hiding in a room in the Laodongfang Hotel at the intersection of Sanma Road and Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession. They, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozha Police Station, rushed to the hotel at 4:30 AM yesterday and arrested Sun. They took him back to the police station and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court at noon. At 3:00 PM, Judge Xiong Huiping conducted a preliminary hearing. Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, stated that the police had found that the defendant was related to the murder of Gu Daosheng, so he was arrested. Due to the lack of time, the investigation had not yet been completed, and he requested a postponement of two weeks to allow for a thorough investigation. The court asked the defendant about his age, origin, occupation, and address, and then granted the postponement for another hearing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>The Murderer of the Young Master of Qian Fengtai Firm Arrested Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>丨 Lu Quanxing from Wuxi 丨</p>
<p>Chen Zhikui, a native of Ningbo and the young master of Qian Fengtai Incense and Candle Shop located at No. 52 Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, was 29 years old this year. On the afternoon of the 14th of last month, he delivered goods to Hongkou to be shipped to Hankou via river steamer. After finishing his business, he returned to the shop at 9:00 PM. Shortly after, he turned to go out, taking a detour through a small alley next to the north side of the building. As he entered his home through the back door upstairs, he was unexpectedly confronted by a thug in the alley who opened fire with a pistol. He was struck in the throat by a bullet and died instantly. The store's accountant, surnamed Chen, was also wounded. The assailant fled into Baoyu Lane on the spot. The injured person was then taken to the hospital for treatment by the patrolmen, and the body was transported to the coroner's office. After the court sent officials to conduct an examination, the family claimed the body for burial, awaiting the patrolmen to apprehend the murderer and bring him to justice. All of these details were previously reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that Jin Jiulin, an inspector of the special agency of the French patrol, has discovered that the murderer of Chen was Lu Quanxing, a 20-year-old man from Wuxi, who was hiding at No. 40, Shuang Gui Li, Rue du Père Froc. Therefore, at 8:00 AM yesterday morning, he led detectives and quietly went to arrest Lu. A pistol and several bullets used in the crime were found. He was taken to the patrol station, interrogated by the detective chief, and then escorted to the Second Special District Local Court at noon for investigation. At 2:30 PM, Judge Tai Huiping, accompanied by court clerk Tao Zongkan, presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. First, Gu Shouxi, the patrol's lawyer, stated the case, saying that the patrol had arrested the defendant for murder, but due to time constraints, a detailed investigation of the case had not been possible. He requested that the defendant be detained temporarily and that the case be investigated and prosecuted after two weeks. The court verified the statement, questioned Lu, and then approved the postponement of the trial for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Fatal Surgery for Scrofula</h3>
<p>丨 Cheng Zhankui Dies Tragically at the Hands of an Incompetent Doctor 丨</p>
<p>Cheng Zhankui, a 42-year-old man from Shandong, worked as a driver for the French-owned Tram Company. However, he was fond of women, which recently led to him contracting scrofula and syphilis. He kept this a secret, fearing that it would become known and he would be disgraced. He stayed alone at the Aido Hotel on West Xinqiao Road, and hired Liu Baokun from Tianjin, who ran the Yongqing Tang medical clinic on Baliqiao Street in the French Concession, for treatment. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Liu performed surgery on Cheng in the clinic, making an incision to treat the scrofula. Unexpectedly, Liu used the knife too forcefully and severed an artery in Cheng's leg, causing Cheng to bleed profusely and turn pale. Liu, realizing his mistake, quickly sent Cheng back to the Aido Hotel. However, the hotel's tea server noticed that Cheng was in critical condition and immediately reported it to the Great World clock tower police station. Detectives took Cheng to Renji Hospital, but he died en route due to excessive blood loss. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination, and a detective was dispatched to arrest the incompetent doctor Liu Baokun for investigation.</p>
<h3>500 Japanese Marines Return Home</h3>
<p>Those Who Participated in the Shanghai Invasion War</p>
<p>Five hundred replacement soldiers of the Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai departed from the Marine Headquarters on Jiangwan Road at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. They traveled via North Sichuan Road, Peng Road, and Huade Road to the Osaka Wharf, boarded a special service ship, and set sail for Sasebo at around 11:00 AM. These replacement soldiers had all participated in the invasion of Shanghai, so many Japanese expatriates went to the wharf to see them off. When they passed North Sichuan Road, Japanese elementary school students stood on the east side of the road, from Aruicheng all the way to Yokohama Bridge, waving flags and cheering, which greatly offended the Chinese.</p>
<h3>Li Zhengwu's Coffin Scheduled to Be Transported to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Departure from Shanghai on the 16th</p>
<p>After Mr. Li Zhengwu, a prominent figure in Shanghai, passed away in his Shanghai residence last month, the Ningbo Fellow-Countrymen Association in Shanghai organized a funeral committee to handle all matters. It is now learned that Mr. Li's coffin will depart from Shanghai on the 16th and arrive in Ningbo on the 17th. Ningbo gentry and scholars, recognizing his contributions to the party and the country and his great achievements, have established three public memorial sites: (1) at the Jiangtian Wharf in Ningbo, (2) on Jiangnan Street in Zhenhai, and (3) in Pumiandi. After the public memorial service, the coffin will be transported by steamboat to the Yigu Villa in Huangmeiyan for temporary placement.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Residents' Association Asks the Municipal Council to Waive the Awning Tax</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession announced the collection of an awning tax, the general merchants and residents believe that the purpose of awnings is to shield from the sun, which is beneficial and harmless to pedestrians. Furthermore, the time they are used is short, and it is not appropriate to levy taxes on them, which would increase the burden on merchants and residents. Therefore, the French Concession Residents' Association sent a letter to the French Municipal Council yesterday, requesting them to revoke their decision. The original text is as follows: Firstly, according to a letter from the Second District Branch, the French Municipal Council has notified all businesses that they must pay awning tax from May of this year. The awnings used by stores are to shield from the sunlight for the benefit of pedestrians. Moreover, the awnings are only used for a few hours each day. In cloudy, rainy weather and during the spring and winter, they are not used at all. Now, the French Municipal Council is using the word "awning" as a reason to collect a large amount of tax, which businesses can hardly afford. We request that your council quickly advocate with the French Municipal Council to rescind this awning tax. The use of awnings is originally for shielding from the sunlight and does not obstruct pedestrians. Taxing them is inappropriate. According to the aforementioned situation, we request that your council consider the difficulties of businesses and revoke the decision to reassure businesses and alleviate the difficulties of merchants. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3>The Famous Female Doctor Huang Qiongxian Will Be Buried Today</h3>
<p>Dr. Huang Qiongxian was the sister of Huang Tingzuo, the former supervisor of students studying in the United States, and the sister of the late wife of President Bu of St. John's University. Huang studied at St. Mary's School in her youth, and then studied medicine at Tongren Hospital in Hongkou. Later, she went to Canada for further studies, graduated, and returned to China.

<h3>Jiangxi Porcelain Publicly Displayed for the Chicago Expo</h3>
<p>China has been preparing for the Chicago Expo for a year, and the products from various provinces have been very enthusiastic. However, due to the government's concerns about the pressing national crisis, the decision was made to stop participating. The producers from various provinces requested the government's guidance and subsidies to participate on their own. More than 400 boxes of exhibits have been shipped out in two batches, as reported in this newspaper. Jiangxi porcelain has the largest quantity of exhibits from various provinces. In addition to the 200 boxes that have already been shipped, there are still dozens of pieces left. Due to packaging and re-boxing procedures, they could not be completed in time, and it is planned to ship them in the third batch. They include a porcelain statue of Premier Sun Yat-sen, 12 feet tall, and dozens of magnetic models made in Jingdezhen. The magnetic models depict the porcelain-making process from the kiln to the coloring, with lifelike figures, which are unique to all past exhibits. In addition, there are also hundreds of other famous and precious porcelain pieces, such as blue-and-white and copper-red vases, and longevity plates made during Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday. Before being shipped, the representatives of the province contacted the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and temporarily displayed them on the third floor of the chamber's commodity exhibition hall for the public to view. Recently, the weather has been clear and sunny, and the number of tourists in the city has also increased significantly.</p>

<h3>Middle School Student Leaves Home to Join the Army</h3>

<h3>Wang Thirtyzi Transferred to Shanghai Local Court</h3>
<p>The Wanted Criminal in the Assassination of Ji Zhongtang</p>
<p>Wang Thirtyzi, a native of Yancheng, Jiangbei, used to be a vagrant on Hujiamu Bridge in Hongkou. During the January 28th Incident, that area became an enemy-occupied zone. As a result, he opened a gambling den and indulged in debauchery, taking advantage of the situation to rise up. Ji Zhongtang, who had been a detective and had just been released from prison, wanted to get a share of the pie, which led to a conflict. Wang and his accomplices shot and killed Ji. At that time, it was in the Japanese-controlled area, so there was no way to investigate. After the ceasefire agreement was concluded, those who had relied on the enemy's power lost their protection. Therefore, Wang was wanted by the local court. Wang fled to the concession and did not hide his tracks. A detective found a pistol on him, and the patrolmen escorted him to the First Special District Local Court. After investigation, it was found that he had committed previous crimes, so he was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment. The local court then learned of this and sent a document to the First Court through Chief Prosecutor Lou, ordering the police to bring him to court. After a preliminary hearing by the original prosecutor Yang An, he ordered him to be detained pending a confrontation with the victim's family.</p>

<h3>Woman Swallows Opium and Is Rescued; Investigation into the Source of the Opium Leads to a Sentence</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Li Shi, a woman from Jiangbei living in a flat in Xinji Bang Road, swallowed opium after quarreling with her husband over a minor matter. She secretly went to Yanzike at No. 257 Huaji Road, bought two jiao of opium, and took it home to commit suicide. Someone noticed and sent her to Tongren Hospital. Because she had only been poisoned for a short time, she was saved by the doctor. She was then discharged from the hospital. The Huishan patrol station learned of this and sent Chinese detective Fu Bingzang to investigate. He learned the source of the opium and arrested Liang Kairi, a native of Ningbo who sold the opium on Huaji Road. He was taken to the patrol station along with the opium pipe and opium paste. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Judge Xiao Xiefen presided over the hearing. The patrol lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated, "The fact of this case is that Li Shi, a woman from Jiangbei, swallowed opium and committed suicide after a minor quarrel with her paramour. Fortunately, she was saved by the doctor, otherwise her life would have been in danger. She should be severely punished." Detective Fu then reported the circumstances of the case and presented the opium pipe and other items for inspection. When questioned, the defendant denied having a private opium den. The patrol lawyer claimed that the defendant was identified by Li Shi at the patrol station yesterday as the person from whom she bought the opium she swallowed. There was no room for denial. After Judge Xiao verified the confession, he sentenced Liang Kairi to one year in prison as a warning. The confiscated opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

It was believed that she had been murdered and the body moved to the location. The case was reported to the First Precinct of the Second District, which ordered Jiang Pingyang of Jiupu to report to the local court for an examination. Prosecutor Yang and others arrived at the scene and confirmed that it was a murder. He ordered that the body be collected and that the murderer be apprehended and brought to justice after the family members identified the body.</p>

Recently, Shen hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against Zhu for embezzlement and breach of trust, listing eight items of malpractice: (1) Embezzling 735 taels and 5 qian of silver received from Hengtongzhuang, and falsely claiming it was paid into the account of Shen Zhongji; (2) Setting up temporary entries to embezzle more than 1,240 yuan; (3) Arbitrarily defaulting on payments, reaching more than 4,400 yuan by the time of closure; (4) More than 5,000 yuan paid for fixed assets was mostly unreal; (5) The maximum amount of defaulted payments was 4,670 taels of silver and 8,400 yuan in foreign currency; (6) His account owed Dahua more than 300 yuan, while he counterclaimed 1,460 taels of silver; (7) Extravagantly spending 1,000 yuan on travel expenses and 200 yuan on entertainment expenses; (8) Purchasing cotton from Tianjin at a high price and selling it at a low price, resulting in a loss of more than 6,000 yuan. The First Special District Local Court had already held a hearing, but because both the plaintiff and the defendant intended to settle the matter, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the hearing, ordering both parties to appear in court and inquiring about the settlement situation. According to the plaintiff Shen Baoyi, the defendant was not sincere about the settlement, so it could not be resolved outside the court. The court then ordered the plaintiff to state the facts of the eight items of malpractice one by one, and then questioned the defendant Zhu Xiaofeng, who defended against each item. Judge Wu verified the confession and stated that the case was purely a dispute over accounts and should first be filed with the civil court for review. He then ordered that the case be suspended and that the plaintiff file a lawsuit with the civil court for review.</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing and Others Initiate Compilation and Printing of "Who's Who of Chinese Business Leaders in Shanghai"</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Mengze of the local business community, considering Shanghai to be a hub of Chinese industry and commerce, especially during this time of increasing foreign aggression, believes that it is essential to unite and support each other to compete with foreign merchants. However, there has long been a lack of statistical reference materials. Therefore, he discussed this with shipping magnate Mr. Yu Shunmao, and also invited prominent figures in Shanghai, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaoyu, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Zhihao, and other gentlemen to sponsor the compilation and printing of "Who's Who of Chinese Business Leaders in Shanghai." The book will focus purely on local industry and commerce. Companies, factories, and firms that manufacture domestic goods and have been investigated and deemed to have achieved considerable success will have their portraits and detailed descriptions of their strengths published in the book. In addition, they also plan to invite industry and commerce experts to publish their opinions and ask key figures of the National Government to write inscriptions to praise them, which is especially valuable. It is said that Mr. Huang, in addition to his existing duties, is taking the time to personally edit the book and has been sending people to conduct investigations every day, extremely busy, fearing that his eyes and ears may not be comprehensive enough and that some hidden talents may be missed. Therefore, all manufacturers and firms who believe they have achieved considerable success are encouraged to send a letter to "Who's Who of Chinese Business Leaders" to apply for review and publication, which will not incur any publication fees. The mailing address is 10 Guangdong Road, 3rd Floor.</p>
<h3>City News</h3>
<p>▲ Advantages of Huasheng Fan from National Goods Factory Hua Sheng Electric Appliance Manufacturing Factory started manufacturing electric fans in the 8th year of the Republic of China, after 14 years of experience, each year's products have considerable reforms in manufacturing. The speed of progress and the precision of the structure are unparalleled, and the most important internal structure of the fan is the shaft collar (i.e. front and rear bosses) at both ends of the motor. The factory initially used extremely fine special copper material, placed in between. However, after a long period of use, the volume of the fan generated heat, so it was changed to steel ball shaft collar. After a long time of testing, the result was that the heat was not reduced, but a rustling sound was generated, which was very loud. Whether in the office or at home, it was very uncomfortable to hear. Mr. Yang Jichuan, the chief engineer of the factory, after several studies, used a chemical method to combine a metal compound of copper to make the shaft collar. Therefore, the fans that are now on the market have metal compound copper installed in the front and rear bosses, which do not generate heat and have no noise. This is the advantage of the Huasheng fan from the National Goods Factory.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, In the news about the reconstruction of the Shanghai North Railway Station published in your newspaper on the 8th of this month, it was stated that the project was contracted by the Jiangnan Construction Company. This was also published in your newspaper's construction special issue on the 9th. After investigation, the project was actually contracted by our company. The content published in your newspaper is not accurate, which has caused misunderstandings in the outside world. Please correct it immediately. Sincerely, Shanghai Zhongnan Construction Company, 22.5.13.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor, With all due respect, I recently read in your newspaper a news item about President Wang denying sending a representative to Guangdong, which involved my name and greatly affects my personal reputation. In addition to writing directly to President Wang, I have enclosed the original letter to President Wang and would like to ask you to publish it to clarify the truth. I am grateful. Sincerely, Wang Xiaoya, May 13.</p>
<p>Attached is Wang Xiaoya's original letter to President Wang, Dear Mr. Jingwei, I recently read in the newspaper that in your telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang, you mentioned someone named "Wang Xiaoya" impersonating your representative. My name is "Xiaoya", and the characters "Ya" and "Ya" are different. Perhaps there is another Wang Xiaoya, but my relatives and friends often mistakenly write "Ya" as "Ya", so I must solemnly declare to avoid misunderstandings. After investigation, the Shanghai Shenbao reported on the 8th of this month that a telegram from Hong Kong said that Wang's representative Xiaoya went to Guangdong to discuss the Lin Quan Conference, while the Xinwen Bao's exclusive telegram said that Wang's representative Xiao Chong went to Guangdong. Your speech in Nanjing on the 10th denying the dispatch of representatives also referred to "Xiao Chong". I thought that the Hong Kong telegram "Xiaoya" published in Shenbao might be a mistake for "Xiao Chong", so I did not correct it. However, your telegram suddenly changed Xiao Chong to Wang Xiaoya. Is it because of rumor mongering and you did not investigate thoroughly? Or is there someone else? I don't know. As for me, I have my own revolutionary position and would not impersonate the representative of an important person. In addition to publishing a solemn statement in Shen Xin and other newspapers, I should ask you to find out the truth and quell the rumors, and also ask you to order the Central News Agency to send a letter to correct it, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>National Shame Week Lecture by Mr. Shen Tilan on the May 3rd Massacre</h3>
<p>Lecture at the YMCA on May 10th</p>
<p>The chairman just said that I went to Jinan to investigate the May 3rd Massacre after it happened. I did go there once, but this will disappoint you, I only saw the surface. For example, Japanese soldiers running rampant on the streets, recklessly. I couldn't see the reasons, situation, and international relations that constituted this massacre in Jinan. I also have very little research on history. Today, I just spent an hour after school to briefly think about the before and after of this massacre, and talk to you about it.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 15th year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army swore an oath to launch the Northern Expedition from Guangzhou. Within a few months, it reached Wuhan, Jiangxi, and Nanjing in March of the 16th year: The rapid military progress during this period was amazing. However, the National Revolution only reached Nanjing. Due to the xenophobic actions of some troops, imperialism incited a demonstration on the pretext, which caused the Nanjing Incident. Later, the Ninghan split, and the Nanjing government held a crackdown on the Communist Party, which caused a setback for the National Revolution in its very smooth journey in the Northern Expedition. In April of the same year, the National Revolutionary Army continued to advance northward from Nanjing along the Jinpu Railway. The Japanese who held power at the time were the Tanaka Cabinet, a cabinet manipulated by a militaristic warlord. He believed that the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was a sweeping away of Japan's rights and interests in North China, so he resolutely sent troops from Qingdao to land. In order to avoid conflict, the Nanjing government kept its troops in Xuzhou and stopped going north. Seeing that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, the Japanese warlords had to withdraw their troops back in September. When the National Revolutionary Army continued the Northern Expedition in April of the 17th year, Japan again sent troops to Qingdao and attacked Jinan to the west. After the National Revolutionary Army came into contact with the Japanese army, Jinan was lost in less than two days. Two months later, what I saw in Jinan was only Japanese cavalry galloping everywhere, Japanese soldiers arbitrarily breaking into houses or shops to search, and prohibiting Chinese people from walking together in groups of three or five. What I saw in Jinan was a piece of land that had become a conquered country for a period of time, and the people of Jinan had become slaves for a period of time.</p>
<p>Ten months later, the National Revolutionary Army went north again and occupied Tianjin and Beiping. Zhang Zuolin, who was outside the customs, wanted to maintain his power in the north, so he entered the customs to resist, but later he was bombed to death by the Japanese in HuangguTun. This kind of action of bombing to death a Chinese warlord also shows Japan's dissatisfaction with the old-style Chinese warlords, and he wanted to find an opportunity to find another suitable puppet tool.</p>
<p>At this time, a local unification was achieved. By the end of the year, Zhang Xueliang and the inside of the pass exchanged news, informally accepting the efforts of the National Revolution to develop outside the pass: In June of the following year, the Liaoning Provincial Government was formally established, accepting the Three Principles of the People and hanging the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag. At this point, China was unified.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Jinan were withdrawn after negotiations, also in April of the second year. It is said that the withdrawal of troops was conditional. The general public naturally does not care how Japan would withdraw its troops.</p>
<p>These are the before and after circumstances of the May 3rd Massacre.</p>
<p>We believe that commemorating a painful national humiliation does not lie in the recollection of the facts themselves, but in focusing on investigating the causes, significance, and relations in which the massacre occurred. We believe that this can increase the significance of the commemoration, and only in this way can we recognize the road ahead and understand our responsibilities.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about it in four parts:</p>
<p>1. The May 3rd Massacre and Japan's Internal Affairs</p>
<p>Japan is a newly emerging imperialist country, and the feudal consciousness of their domestic warlords is very strong. Their power often exceeds that of the government, and they are certainly advocating aggression against China. On the other hand, Japan is also a newly emerging capitalist country, and the power of the domestic capitalist class (financial groups) is equal to that of the warlords, and they are also advocating aggression against China. However, although these two factions have the same purpose of aggression against China, their methods are different. The warlords advocate using force to invade, flaunting the prestige of their militaristic militarism, while the financial groups advocate using economic means to invade, so that China is unknowingly subjected to their oppression. The financial groups advocate this way, seeing the superficial compromise of the powers at the time for the Chinese revolution, believing that only by prospering China can they invade China. This contradictory law is correct and can be said in their own country. However, the warlords believe that economic aggression is not painful enough. On the one hand, they use the large number of unemployed people in the country and the demands of the petty bourgeoisie to call for the development of the Far East and the expansion of colonies, and carry out their militaristic militarism dreams. The cannon of May 3rd is the beginning of exposing the internal conflicts of Japanese imperialism! And the rise of warlord power?</p>
<p>A year later, when the Japanese troops withdrew from Jinan, the majority of the Japanese people and the bourgeoisie saw that the effect of military aggression was not so good, and many criticized the warlords. The Japanese warlords originally wanted to use the Chinese warlords' civil war to gain benefits, but the unification of China has become a general demand, and it is impossible for him to use it in the end. After he bombed Zhang Zuolin to death, it promoted Zhang Xueliang's cooperation with the country. This made the majority of the Japanese people and a small number of financial groups hate Tanaka. In this year, Tanaka committed suicide. In the next few years, government leaders such as Hamaguchi and Inukai successively stabbed, and even last year's bomb case in Hongkou Park. The clues in the middle are very noteworthy.</p>
<p>Today's political turmoil in Japan, the rise of left-leaning thought, the increasing dissatisfaction of the proletariat and the intellectual class with the current government, and the increase in assassinations, I am afraid that the end began with the cannon of May 3rd? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Instructions from the Jiangsu Education Department Regarding Opposition to Graduation Examinations</h3>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, recently received a secret report stating that students from twelve schools, including Wuxi Normal School, held their first joint meeting at the Wuxi Education Association on May 2nd. They opposed the graduation examinations and submitted meeting minutes. Director Zhou believed that the students' excuse that the curriculum standards were not yet unified was completely unreasonable and unacceptable. He suspected that such actions were initiated by a few troublemakers and that students with good grades would not be afraid of the difficulty and would participate in the examinations. However, upon reviewing the meeting minutes, he found phrases such as "contacting various schools, uniting together, contacting by region, and electing representatives," indicating an intention to escalate the situation and potentially incite others. He instructed each school to strictly prevent and earnestly advise students not to be incited by such individuals and drawn into the vortex. Those who do not participate in the graduation examinations will not have their graduation qualifications recognized, will not be issued graduation certificates, and will not have the opportunity to further their education. In addition to instructing the Wuxi County Education Bureau to circulate this order to all public and private senior middle schools under its jurisdiction for compliance, he also instructed education bureaus in other counties to actively prepare. For those traveling long distances to take the examinations, he has already submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to consult with the Ministry of Railways to implement group ticket discounts on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai railway lines. If taking long-distance buses or inland river steamers, the travel will be free of charge.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Central Petition Delegation Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Most Students Have Not Yet Resumed Classes</p>
<p>▲Departing for Nanjing Tonight to Petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>丨Student Association Representatives Petition Again丨</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong Central University incident occurred, the student body recently organized a petition delegation to go to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education. They arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Most of the students at the university have still not resumed classes and are waiting for the central government to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Zhong Gongxun, Li Zaixing, Rao Yuancang, and other representatives of the Sun Yat-sen University Student Association went to the Ministry of Education again at 4:00 PM on the 12th to petition. Secretary Zhou received them on behalf of the Minister. The representatives explained that the turmoil at Sun Yat-sen University had not subsided and that the students had not resumed classes for a long time, which was a great sacrifice. They requested that officials be sent to investigate the matter impartially. Zhou replied that unless Vice Minister Duan directly inquired with President Zou, it would be difficult to obtain the truth, and he promised to forward the matter to the Minister for handling. On the 12th, the association sent a telegram to all professors and students of Sun Yat-sen University, stating that they had learned of the insult and assault on professors by the medical staff at the university. They had initially hoped that the authorities would take decisive action to severely punish the perpetrators and pacify the situation, but they had received reports that the authorities were not only failing to do so but were also trying every means to protect them and place them above the law. The students, striving for justice, were also being falsely accused and arbitrarily dismissed, harming the youth more than anything else. The association expressed deep concern and felt compelled to speak out. Therefore, in addition to contacting students in Nanjing and Shanghai for unified support, they sent a telegram of condolence, urging them to continue fighting for the country and the school, and promising to provide unwavering support from afar.</p>

<h3>Zhong Yongsen's Moving Performance Ensures China Retains the Sino-Portuguese Cup</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Match Result: China Wins 3-2</p>
<p>Portuguese Team Leads 1-0 in the First Half; China Wins 3-1 in the Second Half</p>
<p>The Sino-Portuguese International Football Cup began in 1925, with the Chinese team winning the first championship and retaining the cup. In the following year, China and Portugal each won once, but the final match was suspended due to an incident, leaving the matter unresolved. Due to various reasons, the competition was not held for several years. This year, the leaders of the football communities of both countries revived the old event, and the Sino-Portuguese Cup, which had been interrupted, was revived. In the first match of this year, China won 7-2. Yesterday, the two countries met for the second time at the baseball field, and China won again with a score of 3-2. Thus, the Sino-Portuguese Cup was once again retained by China for another year.</p>
<p>▲Zhong Yongsen's Contribution Tops the Entire Team</p>
<p>Yesterday's victory for China was the result of the joint efforts of the entire team. However, Zhong Yongsen's contribution surpassed all others. Zhong possesses both intelligence and courage, and his skills in passing and shooting are excellent. The team's three goals, both directly and indirectly, relied on his efforts. Lu Zhongen's clean hands and feet, taking care of both high and low balls, were commendable. The reunion of Feng Yunyou and Li Ning, old partners, was also remarkable. Chen Zhenhe's experience, Tu Kaiyuan's bravery, and Liang Shutang's strength formed a solid defensive line that could rival the opponents. It is a pity that their cooperation was not yet fully refined. The three midfielders, though selected from the best, did not fully exert their strength. Avoiding rashness, they were almost smooth. Their wonderful performance and refreshing footwork were rarely seen. Wan Xianghua's several through balls were commendable.</p>
<p>▲Gu Sitan's Frankness is Admirable</p>
<p>The Portuguese team's players, possessing both strength and flexibility, were indeed formidable opponents for China. The entire team was scattered in various locations, with no possibility of coordination. Unexpectedly, once formed, they were formidable. Gu Sitan, the center-back, held a key position, leading the troops and generals, distributing their efforts, or cooperating with internal officials, guarding key points. This man truly held the key to the Portuguese team's ability to demonstrate its strength. Langgeer's agility was comparable to that of Japanese player Ke Lasha. Masail, not wearing football shoes, was inevitably inferior. The entire team performed well in the first half against the wind, but performed worse in the second half, mainly due to insufficient stamina.</p>

<p>Li Ning Liang Shutang Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen Chen Zhenhe Li Yichen</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Tu Kaiyuan Lu Jiaqiu</p>

<p>Keluosi Gu Sitan H Ke Lasha</p>
<p>A Ke Lasha Leimidi S Natuo</p>
<p>Xi Na</p>
<p>▲Lu Zhongen Saves Adu Three Times</p>
<p>When 3:00 PM arrived, fans were still streaming in, like the waters of a river bursting its banks. He Chunhui brought the ball onto the field. With a whistle, the Portuguese team kicked off against the wind. Ke Lasha passed to Langgeer, but Feng Yunyou intercepted halfway. Wan's counterattack was unsuccessful. Gu Sitan made a long pass, and Xi Na released his horse in the suburbs. Doctor Tu could not stop him, and the ball was passed into the center. Ke Lasha shot at the goal on the penalty line, but Lu Zhongen calmly caught it and then sent it out. Leimidi entered the encirclement again. S Natuo rushed in a few steps and had a chance to shoot, but Lu Zhongen saved it again. When Xi Na came again, Lu was prepared and caught it smoothly.</p>
<p>▲Sun Jinshun Eager to Serve the Country</p>
<p>China, under heavy pressure for a long time, was eager to take action. Suddenly, Liang Shutang obtained the ball and passed it to Wan nearby. He dribbled it for two zhang and passed it to Sun Jinshun. Waiting for Gu Sitan to come and steal, the ball scurried into the east. Zhong Yongsen, like fire and boiling water, broke through three lines of defense in a row. Jiangshan'er could not resist and had to force a corner kick. Zhong kicked it in, as if writing a beginner's guide. Keluosi panicked and fouled another corner kick. Wan took the kick, which was also excellent. Doctor Tu kicked too hard, sending it into the clouds. Soon after, the Chinese flag was flying again in the Portuguese team's defense. Li Yichen, troubled by Gu Sitan, passed it urgently to Sun. He was less than ten yards from the goal. Sun Iron Leg raised his iron leg and shot with all his might, but it was five inches above the goal and lightly flew over. The audience could not help but sigh and die of regret.</p>
<p>▲Langgeer Builds Merit First</p>
<p>After this, the Chinese defense suffered frequent disasters, and dangers were often seen. B Gong Shanfu was extremely fierce, and he drilled in whenever he found an opening. Feng Yunyou lost his concentration slightly, and he went deep alone. Li Ning quickly led his troops to support him, and he kicked and shot. Lu's eyes were sharp and his feet were fast, saving the siege. China launched a counter-offensive, but was blocked and turned back. Kelasha's momentum was great, and he approached the restricted area again. Lu Zhongen was diligent and cautious, picking up the ball whenever he saw it, without any mistakes. Wan had a corner kick opportunity, which was bounced out by A Kelasha's back. Wan was still unwilling and came to attack again. Zhong Yongsen was impatient and fast, and the offside was cancelled. The Portuguese team took advantage of the emptiness of China's internal defense, and Kelasha led his troops deep. Langgeer got the ball and broke into the penalty area. Li and Feng were unable to return in time, and Langgeer shot low at the goal with a thunderous speed, and Lu Zhongen was caught off guard, and the record was opened.</p>
<p>▲Li Yichen Met the Opportunity</p>
<p>The Chinese team attacked several times, Li Yichen failed in front, and Sun Jinshun missed in the back. Doctor Tu kicked a long shot, with full force, but it was only one foot higher, and the good time in the first half passed away. The break was not long, and the warhorses were roaring again. China was in the north, facing the sun against the wind, and the situation was extremely unfavorable. At this point, the audience also said that China would hardly escape this time, but after the kick-off, the momentum was even stronger than in the first half. After three passes and two passes, Zhong had already entered the heavy defense, and was blocked by the internal guards. He quickly passed it to Wan from afar, and Wan raised his foot and flicked it back. Li Yichen was right next to the goal, and headed it in.</p>
<p>▲Three to Two, China Succeeds</p>
<p>After the autumn colors were evenly divided, the Chinese team's arrogance was even greater. Zhong Yongsen was a rare talent who came later, and his killing skills were extremely powerful, sometimes in and sometimes out, as if he was in a no-man's land. Even Yonghan such as Gu Sitan and the old hero Mai Sail could not do anything to him. At one point, Zhong was injured by a collision and left the field. Not long after, he returned to the field from the inside to help the war. The Chinese team's forwards increased their courage a lot. In an instant, Zhong's arrogance swallowed up the mountains and rivers, and he was alone in the battle, avoiding tens of thousands of people, carrying the ball straight in, and smashing into the dragon gate, taking the lead with two to one, winning the sound of applause. China turned defeat into victory and continued to attack. The Portuguese were not willing to be slaughtered and took the opportunity to retaliate. Therefore, the Chinese defense was not consolidated, the wind was strong and the ball was fast, and Chen Zhenhe's interception failed. B Gong Shanfu took the lead, fifteen yards from the near door, with a bang, and the game was tied again. At this point, the atmosphere of the war became tense again. Zhong Yongsen launched an uprising on the border, as fast as flying, and the next Nato lost his horse, and Mai Sail came to chase him very hard. Zhong had no one in his eyes, until the penalty line, he hurriedly sent it to the front of the door. Li Yichen could not shoot, and Wan's feet swayed across. General Zhong returned to the battlefield, and swept his body, and the ball entered the door. The four seats cheered wildly. Although the Portuguese tried hard to counterattack, but the time did not allow, a whistle, and my China won the championship calmly.</p>
<h3>The End of the Football Season, Tung Wah vs. British Allied Forces</h3>

<p>Jiangda Games Day Two</p>
<h3>Today, the All-Around Sports Athletics Championships Will Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Field Event Championship Belongs to National Central University with 36 Points</p>
<p>Track Event Championship Belongs to Guanghua University with 35 Points</p>
<p>Hu Ruisheng Equals National Record in Women's 100 Meters</p>
<p>A Total of Ten New Records Were Set During the Two Days of the Meet</p>
<p>The sixth Jiangda University Track and Field Meet has concluded yesterday. Starting today, the all-around events will begin, and the women's track and field events will also conclude today. National Central University won the championship with 36 points. In the track events championship, National Central University and Guanghua University had equal scores throughout, creating a tense situation. It was not until the final 800-meter race that Guanghua took a two-point lead and won the championship with 35 points. National Central University came in second with 33. In terms of men's and women's results, a total of nine new records were set, and Ms. Hu Ruisheng equaled Sun Guiyun's national record of 13.4 seconds in the 100-meter dash, which is commendable. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Venue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wind became stronger, and felt hats and straw hats were blown all over the venue, making the competition more difficult. Because all the events were finals, and the track and field championships were yet to be decided, the audience was twice as large as on the first day, with many women also in attendance. The track competition between Guanghua and National Central University was particularly fierce. As a result, Guanghua won the championship with 35 points to 32. Guanghua students were excited and cheered incessantly. National Central University was victorious in the field events and women's sports, and their cheers often battled with those of Guanghua, adding much to the excitement of the venue.</p>
<h3>Views on Success and Failure</h3>
<p>▲Guanghua Has Outstanding Talent in Track Events</p>
<p>▲National Central University Lacks Outstanding Talent</p>
<p>▲Daxia's Field Events Are Flawed</p>
<p>The men's track and field championship has been decided, with the field events going to National Central University and the track events going to Guanghua, marking the first time Guanghua has won the Jiangda University track and field championship. The reason why National Central University won against Daxia in the field events is that they have more talent and are more well-rounded. Daxia lacked talent in the pole vault and triple jump, how could they hope to win? In the track events, Guanghua won first place in six of the eight events, which is commendable. The reason for National Central University's failure can be summarized in one sentence: although they have many talented people, they lack outstanding individuals, so in the final 800-meter race to decide the outcome, they could only listen to their natural failure.</p>

<h3>Field Event Results</h3>
<p>▲Shot Put Final was Fierce</p>
<p>▲Yang and Chen Both Set New Records</p>
<p>▲Women's High Jump also Set New Record</p>
<p>Yesterday's field events included four men's events. The Shot Put was the most fierce competition. Yang Yongcan of National Central University and Chen Baoqiu of Daxia both set new meet records with 12.20 meters. National Central University had a wealth of talent in the Pole Vault, sweeping the top three places. The champion, Li Disheng, had a profound understanding of the sport, with graceful posture and skill of 3.37 meters, which was not easy. If there had been no strong winds, the results could have been even better. Zhou Mengqiao's triple jump of 12.27 meters was also rare. Although the Javelin final was with the wind, the results were mediocre. The famous Wang Jihuai only took first place with 42.95 meters, which was unexpected. The women's field events included two events. Wu Houbai took first place in the Shot Put with 7.80 meters, and Ms. Hu Ruisheng set a new meet record in the High Jump with 1.20 meters. Details are described below.</p>
<p>▲Men's Shot Put The two veterans Chen Baoqiu (Daxia) and Yang Yongcan (National Central University) competed extremely fiercely. Chen first reached a distance of 11.20 meters, marking it with a small pennant. Yang Yongcan used his brute strength, and several times in a row, he was finally caught up. However, the ball thrown by Yang hit Chen's flag, making it difficult to measure Yang's distance. A certain referee who inserted the pole at the time inserted Yang's flag near Chen's, leaving a distance of an inch or so. National Central University believed that this was incorrect, and reported it to Chief Referee Shen Siliang. Shen also believed that it was difficult to distinguish who was closer, so he assumed that the distance between the two was equal, and exceptionally Chen and Yang had another three final throws. Whoever threw the farthest would get first place. Chen Baoqiu threw first, and both times were farther than Yang Yongcan. Who knew that in the last time, Yang used all his strength and threw with all his might, actually exceeding Chen's mark. After measuring, Yang's farthest was 10.94 meters, and Chen's was 10.75 meters. Thus, the first place in the shot put went to Yang Yongcan, and Chen was the runner-up. However, the results were the same, both being 11.20 meters, breaking Lu Ming's Jiangda record of 10.73 meters.</p>
<p>1st Yang Yongcan (National Central University) 11.20 meters</p>
<p>2nd Chen Baoqiu (Daxia) 11.20 meters</p>
<p>3rd Zhang Jiechun (National Central University) 9.96 meters</p>
<p>4th Yin Xiamin (National Central University) 9.77 meters</p>
<p>▲Pole Vault This sport is National Central University's "family heirloom". After the old ancestor Jiang Xiangqing, there was Xia Xiang, and after Xia Xiang, there was Chen Ling. After Chen Ling graduated, now there is Li Disheng. Li's skill is no less than the previous three, his posture is graceful, and he has a lot of research on his body and when he crosses the horizontal bar. Unfortunately, yesterday's strong wind was blowing, and the horizontal bar was blown off every time. After the ranking was decided, Li stopped immediately, and it was not convenient to raise it and jump again. The current result of 3.37 meters is already not easy, or it may not have reached its highest record. The second and third places also belonged to National Central University, and Xu Xizuan of Jiaotong University got fourth place.</p>
<p>▲Javelin National Central University was completely defeated. Wang Jihuai won the championship with 42.95 meters. Although it was with the wind, the results were mediocre, which was unexpected. It is known that Wang is the Jiangda record holder, and his record is 45.38 meters. This time, the fall was great, and it was with the wind. The results of the four names are as follows:</p>
<p>1st Wang Jihuai (Guanghua) 42.95 meters</p>
<p>2nd Du Shuzhen (Jinling) 39.90 meters</p>
<p>3rd Chen Baoqiu (Daxia) 39.85 meters</p>
<p>4th Huang Jianfei (Daxia) 39.40 meters</p>
<p>▲Triple Jump Although this competition did not break the Jiangda record, the results were remarkable. Zhou Mengqiao of National Central University made 12.27 meters in the second preliminary round and got first place. He was still close to the Jiangda record of 12.69 meters made by Huang Bingkun in 1926. Fan Jiaju of Jiaotong University grabbed the second place in the third jump of the final, with a score of 12.22 meters, which was very close to the first place, which was not easy. The results of the four names are as follows:</p>
<p>1st Zhou Mengqiao (National Central University) 12.27 meters</p>
<p>2nd Fan Jiaju (Jiaotong) 12.22 meters</p>
<p>3rd Deng Kanshun (National Central University) 11.91 meters</p>
<p>4th Gu Shangxiang (Jinan) 11.78 meters</p>
<p>▲Women's High Jump Hu Ruisheng of National Central University competed fiercely with He Menghua of Jinan and Zhuang Lingzhao of Daxia. At the last height, the three women failed to pass after three jumps. In the fourth jump, Ms. He and Ms. Zhuang also failed to pass, while Ms. Hu Ruisheng jumped over safely and won first place with a result of 1.20 meters, breaking Ye Zhanmei's Jiangda record of 1.18 meters. Second place belonged to He Menghua, third place was Zhuang Lingzhao, and fourth place was Zhang Chongying of National Central University.</p>

<h3>Track Event Sketches</h3>
<p>(1) 100 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Chen Jiayou Leans Forward to Win: The 100-meter race was the first final in the men's track events and one of the most exciting. Short-distance heroes gathered on the line. Due to a slight wind, the starter consulted with the athletes, ordering them to run backward from the finish line. Everyone was unwilling, so the record was counted as being with the wind. On the first start, Huang Feilong of Jinan, who had achieved a time of 11.2 seconds the day before, false-started. On the second restart, Huang could not avoid feeling disheartened, leading to him falling behind. For the first 40 meters, the seven runners advanced almost in a line, making it difficult to distinguish who was in the lead. After 50 meters, Wang Jihuai led by two feet. Chen Jiayou of Jinan chased hard behind Wang. Approaching the finish line, they arrived almost simultaneously. However, Chen Jiayou leaned his chest forward, securing first place. Wang was second, Xu in third was also very close, and Lu Linyu in fourth was slightly behind. Huang Feilong was fifth, with a time of 11.4 seconds, tying the Jiangda record.</p>
<p>(2) 200 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Wang Jihuai Strives for Revenge: Wang Jihuai, having only lost by a hair's breadth in the 100 meters, was determined to win the 200 meters. Eight runners started. Chen Jiayou, after the 100-meter high hurdles, lacked the strength. At 80 meters after the start of the 200 meters, his momentum waned, and he withdrew. The remaining seven continued forward. Initially, it was difficult to tell who was in the lead. At the 100-meter mark, Wang Jihuai held a significant advantage, leading by two feet. Xu Biao from Central chased hard behind. Arriving at the finish line, the difference between Xu and Wang was truly no more than a shoulder's width. It was indeed a close call. Ma Yu was third, and Huang Feilong was fourth, with a time of 24.1 seconds, breaking the Jiangda record.</p>
<p>(3) 400 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Dong Shuzhao Shows His Power Again: Dong Shuzhao, having already won the 1500 meters, displayed great power in the 400 meters, leading all the way. The other runners were no match for him. He finished more than four meters ahead of the second-place finisher. The time of 54 and four-fifths seconds can be said to be not bad. Second place was Liu Fukang from Jiaotong. Tao Yingjie from Guanghua was more than four meters behind Liu, an unexpected result. Ma Yu from Central finished fourth.</p>
<p>(4) 800 Meters</p>
<p>▲ The Championship Hinges on This Event: The final determination of the track championship between Guanghua and Central depended entirely on this event. On the first day, they each scored five points. In the 100 meters, they each scored three points. In the 200 meters, they each scored five points. In the 400 meters, Guanghua exceeded by six points. Central regained seven points in the high hurdles, leading by one point. After the 10,000 meters, the two schools were equal again. The decision of the championship hinged entirely on the very last 800 meters. Guanghua had two runners, and Central had three. In the first lap, Hu Shixuan remained in the lead. Dong Shuzhao was not flustered, steadily following. The third and fourth runners were also from Central, followed by Liu Fukang from Jiaotong. Dong was five hundred meters behind Hu. In the final 250 meters, Dong Shuzhao began to sprint, charging forward like a runaway horse. At the finish line, Hu was twenty meters behind Dong. Hu was exhausted, and Liu Fukang from Jiaotong made a push to overtake him at the line. Hu finished third, and Tian Hanlin from Central finished fourth, with a very good time of 2 minutes 11 seconds, breaking the Jiangda record. The track championship thus went to Guanghua.</p>
<p>(5) 10,000 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Liu Chongli Runs Further and Further Ahead: Liu Chongli's victory in the 10,000 meters for Guanghua did not involve intense competition. After 4,000 meters, there was no room for competition. Peng Shuxin led at the start, followed by Liu, then Zhou Guangwu from Jinan and Jiang Wensen from Central. Zhou Guangwu was tall with long strides, running very fast. For the first 2,000 meters, Zhou was clearly in first place, with Liu following. Zhou gradually slowed down, looking tired. Reaching 4,000 meters, Liu Chongli surged ahead. Zhou Guangwu fell to second, followed by Jiang Wensen, Su Keming, Peng Shuxin, Bao Heqing, and Zhan Yiji in order. Reaching 6,000 meters, Liu ran further and further ahead, and Zhou Guangwu was overtaken by Jiang Wensen, with Zhou in second. Su Keming, Bao Heqing, and Zhan Yiji followed. At 7,000 meters and 8,000 meters, Zhou Guangwu fell further and further behind. Jiang Wensen, Peng Shuxin, and Bao Heqing advanced in that order, with Zhan Yiji chasing Zhou in sixth. Liu Chongli reached the finish line, with Jiang Wensen 400 meters behind, Peng Shuxin another 400 meters behind, and Bao Heqing in fourth. Zhou Guangwu was fifth, and Zhan Yiji was sixth, with an average time of 39 minutes, 25 and four-fifths seconds.</p>
<p>(6) High Hurdles</p>
<p>▲ Liu Yingjun's Graceful Form: With only five runners starting, Liu Yingjun had the fastest start and the most graceful form over the hurdles. Chen Jiayu chased desperately behind, very close over the last hurdle. However, Chen jumped too high over the hurdle, slowing his advance, and Liu reached the finish line. Chen was second, Xu Rukang third, and Chen Hongqi fourth, with a time of 17.1 seconds, breaking the Jiangda record.</p>

<p>(7) Intermediate Hurdles</p>
<p>▲ Tao Yingjie's Specialty: Tao Yingjie gave up the high hurdles to focus on the intermediate hurdles, easily defeating Zhu Shouhun from Central. He led all the way, as the intermediate hurdles were Tao's specialty. However, due to a lack of practice, the time was not good, 64 and three-fifths seconds. Zhu was second, Liu Yingjun third, and Wang Fengting from Jinling fourth.</p>
<p>(8) Women's 50 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Hu Ruisheng Unbeatable: This was a preliminary round, divided into two groups. There was wind. Hu Ruisheng was unbeatable in the first group, finishing three meters ahead of Liu Guanglin. The time of 7.4 seconds was counted as being with the wind, but was still excellent. In the second group, (1), (2), and (3) were very close, with Zhou Yueying first at 7.5 seconds. In today's final, Hu Ruisheng secured first place.</p>

<p>(9) Women's 100 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Ties Sun Guiyun's Record: Due to the small number of participants, it was changed to a final. Hu Ruisheng created a surprising record of 13.8 seconds, tying Sun Guiyun's record, with quick strides and excellent form. Zhou Yueying was second, far behind.</p>
<p>(10) Women's 200 Meters</p>
<p>▲ Central Sweeps Again: The women's events were entirely swept by female students from Central, including in the 200 meters: (1) Guo Zongying, (2) Chen Qing, (3) Wu Houbai. Cao Huizhen from Guanghua finished fourth, with an average time of 33.4 seconds.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Held at 10:00 AM Today</p>
<p>The Jiangda Sports Association is scheduled to hold an executive committee meeting at Jiaotong University at 10:00 AM today to discuss important matters regarding this year's track and field events and future plans.</p>
<h3>Baihong Is Very Strong</h3>
<p>Brothers at Fanwangdu</p>
<p>Almost Completely Defeated</p>
<p>The Baihong Track and Field Team and the John Track and Field Team competed in two events yesterday afternoon at Fanwangdu. Initially, both sides harbored strong ambitions to win, so they worked exceptionally hard during the competition. As a result, the Baihong team almost completely swept the events. Fortunately, John managed to win first place in the triple jump. Cheng Jinguang's 100-meter time was 11.2, appearing effortless. The first place in the 200 meters was seized by Da Mao Sun Huipei, with a time of 23.9 seconds, which was not easy. The first place in the 400 meters was also won by Zhu Ruihong of Baihong, with a time of 56.7 seconds. All three top spots in the 800 meters went to Baihong, with Lin Quanbo taking the lead, with a time of 2 minutes 21 seconds, which he said was not his best performance. John was completely defeated in the 1500 meters, with Dong Jiaxie dominating the event with a time of 4 minutes 42 seconds. Other track and field results were also good and are listed below.</p>

<h3>Record of Sports Performance by the Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers College</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Physical Education Teachers College in the French Concession of this city held a sports performance yesterday afternoon at the Chinese Basketball Hall on Rue du Père Robert. More than a thousand male and female guests attended. The program consisted of 27 performances, of which basic exercises, stepping dance, field dance, Gongli boxing, Ximiao dance, flag semaphore, and "不如歸去" (不如归去, a play title) were the most outstanding, with accurate postures, demonstrating the high level of daily training. In addition, the pattern stacking, singing, and circle dance of the affiliated primary school were lively, and all the spectators praised them.</p>

<h3>Plan</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>Since the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan achieved results, the term "plan" has become very popular, such as the Hoover Twenty-Year Plan and the Hitler Four-Year Plan, etc. All the tunes are sung very nicely. However, the former ended with Hoover losing his job as president before the plan could be fully realized, and Hitler has only just started. Apart from excluding Jews and arresting communists, there hasn't been much significant progress yet. In China, whatever the world has, we must also have it, so there is a certain minister's Four-Year Industrial Construction Plan. As for whether this plan has already started and how it is progressing, forgive me for not being able to or having the right to investigate, so I dare not make hasty judgments. What I want to talk about is another kind of plan.</p>
<p>This is what the big headline in the recent newspapers told me:</p>
<p>"Enemy troops in eastern Luan are advancing steadily, and our troops plan to retreat westward." Please allow me to add a little commentary. The word "plan" here is used as an adverbial adjective, meaning "in a planned manner," not as a verb still "in the planning" stage. Originally, we had known for a long time about the news that "our troops have safely withdrawn!" The ability to "withdraw" and do so "safely" naturally implies a pre-existing plan.</p>
<p>I have not read books such as Sun Tzu's "Art of War," and I am completely ignorant of modern military science. I only remember reading the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" as a child, knowing that "make the real appear unreal, and the unreal appear real" is a common strategy used by military strategists; and military common sense such as "retreat to advance, defend to attack," and "lure the enemy deep and annihilate them in a concentrated manner" has occasionally been gleaned from war news. Therefore, I believe that a planned withdrawal is naturally aimed at a counterattack, especially since news reports also contain phrases such as "many enemies annihilated at the front," making it even more believable that this withdrawal is not a defeat. Therefore, I have always been optimistic, hoping that one day we will "recover lost territory."</p>
<p>However, after seeing the conversation of Mr. Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Committee, my optimism could not help but waver greatly. Mr. Wu said, "We only hope that land that can be lost in three days will take two months to lose." This is probably the "entire plan." If we follow this plan, I dare not speculate on when the entire China will be "lost"; even just thinking about the soldiers who are fighting in hand-to-hand combat under the artillery fire, and that the price of their flesh and blood is only to exchange "three days" for "two months," I don't know how to express myself.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I think that this is to realize the plan, I have to accept it as satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Visit</h3>
<p>— Lou Jinsheng</p>
<p>After walking for a while in the warm sunlight, I arrived at the home of the wife of my recently deceased friend, Ru. I sipped the green tea in my glass, looking at the wife of my deceased friend sitting across from me as I spoke. She is a woman who loves to move and talk. Today, she was wearing a washed-out, ill-fitting patriotic cloth shirt. Because of the heat, her face was very radiant. Ru died only last year. I haven't seen Ru's wife for three or four months. I thought she hadn't changed at all, still smiling and talking lively, making people feel that the only difference was that she was wearing a more plain cloth shirt than before.</p>
<p>When Ru and Yu were in love, I had also helped them. When they were pursuing this matter, I even jokingly said to Ru, "Sometimes I also love Yu," which made Ru unhappy. Now, facing the young woman in front of me, this woman wearing a washed-out, ill-fitting patriotic cloth shirt, and thinking that she is already a "widow," some restless thoughts naturally arose. But then I thought of my deceased friend, our friendship which was not superficial, and some remorse surfaced in my heart. I hurriedly searched for an irrelevant sentence to cover up my unease:</p>
<p>"Do you know how Liu Yuzhen is doing now?"</p>
<p>"I don't know... I don't correspond with anyone now. Let those who know that Ru is dead know, and I won't write letters to those who don't."</p>
<p>Liu Yuzhen was a friend who was often with Ru and Yu when they were in love, and now she is a woman who is married and has children. When Yu said that she doesn't correspond with anyone now, the face that was originally smiling suddenly showed a heavy shadow, and her tone became hard. Then, I saw two lines of clear tears streaming down her eyes.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Are you so discouraged?"</p>
<p>I felt that I was too clumsy and said such a thing. I regretted it, I shouldn't have stirred up her pain, and I was too young to give her some gentle comfort, so I had to sit quietly with apology. Fortunately, this period of silence did not last long, and she had already put on a cheerful face. She didn't want to let people know her pain. I knew it.</p>
<p>Confused thoughts made it impossible for me to stay here any longer. I just said, "I'll come see you again when I have time," and left. But on the way, the melancholy in my heart was truly unknown to anyone!</p>
<h3>Below the Dantian</h3>
<p>— Jian Guang</p>
<p>Mr. Cao Juren said: Enlightened people practice guidance and supplementation, returning to the Dantian. The method is skillful and the time is slow. For example: a fox from the Republic of China in the years 12 and 13, practicing Taoism in Beijing. It wasn't until this year that both chickens and dogs became immortals. Taking ten years is too long. As far as I know, modern Taoist priests have their own electric cultivation methods, not returning to the "Dantian" but returning to below the "Dantian."</p>
<p>Cultivation below the "Dantian" includes the art of the bedroom and the "Classic of the Plain Girl." The Yellow Emperor ascended to immortality after having intercourse with seventy-seven forty-nine women, and the wonders below the "Dantian" are even more indescribable. If Mr. Ye Dehui heard my statement, he would surely laugh loudly in the underworld and say, "My Dao is not alone!"</p>
<p>Let me illustrate with an example. Yang Taizhen's unofficial biography states: "In the seventh month of the fourth year of Tianbao, the Yang family was made a noble concubine, her father Xuan Yan was given the title of Prefect of Jiyin, her mother, Li, was made Lady of Longxi Commandery, and her cousin Zhao was appointed as a minister. In the seventh year, Zhao was promoted to Imperial Censor and given the title of Prefect of the Capital, and given the name Guozhong. Her eldest sister was made Lady of Han, her third sister was made Lady of Guo, and her eighth sister was made Lady of Qin; they all received their orders on the same day, and each received 100,000 coins per month for cosmetics." The crystallization of our country's spiritual civilization, where chickens and dogs become immortals through methods below the Dantian, is another secret of Taoist practice. Mr. Cao Juren's thinking is old-fashioned, only seeing the wonderful use of the "Dantian"; but not knowing the wonderful use of "below the Dantian," which has existed since ancient times and is prevalent today, and must be praised!</p>
<p>There is a character in the Grand View Garden, who has no connection with the Jia family, but comes to live in the Grand View Garden because of cultivating the "Dantian." Mr. Cao Xueqin's veiled writing seems to tell us that the reason she wins the favor of the Jia family is also "below the Dantian." That person is Miaoyu, and everyone should respect her!</p>
<p>A Tang Dynasty folk song says: "Don't be sad when giving birth to a daughter, don't be happy when giving birth to a son!" This can be used as a praise for today!</p>
<h3>Amao</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun Yuan</p>
<p>The cold wind seeped in through the cracks in the door, and the bean-like lamplight flickered uncertainly. Everything around was quiet. Amao was staring blankly at the lamplight, pondering his fate.</p>
<p>Amao, everyone in the village knew him as a frugal man, who didn't gamble or smoke. But in recent years, he didn't know what kind of bad luck he'd encountered, not only selling off the several acres of land passed down from his ancestors, but also incurring a lot of debt.</p>
<p>The year before last, the water was high, and Amao's fields were flooded. Half a year of hard work only yielded a few grains of rice. The money he exchanged was not enough to pay the rent rice to Master Wang in the city. So he had to borrow dozens of yuan from Master Gu in the town. After several bitter pleas, he finally borrowed fifty yuan. It was stated that the monthly interest was 2.5%; this 2.5% monthly interest was still Master Gu seeing that he was pitiful and taking pity on him.</p>
<p>Last autumn, the weather was really good, and the rice grew green and tall. After Amao ate dinner, he always went to the head of the field every day to take a walk, looking at the plump rice ears, a kind of inexplicable joy would slip out from his heart. He would laugh in his heart. The rice gently swayed in the evening breeze, as if laughing with him. Lying in bed at night, although he felt a little sore in his bones, the golden hope made him forget the hard work of the day.</p>
<p>When the rice was brought to the threshing ground, the price of rice fell, and Amao's hope was shattered.</p>
<p>Amao sold all the rice, earning a total of more than a hundred yuan. He paid off Master Gu's debt, paid half of the bean cake money he owed, and there were still two old silver dollars hiding in Amao's pocket, and a few liters of coarse rice piled in the rice bucket at home.</p>
<p>On the tenth day of the tenth month, Master Wang in the city opened his granary. Amao's neighbor, Ashui, had already collected dozens of yuan to pay it back, and Uncle Zhang and Li Genbao had also gone to the city to pay it back. The rest of the villagers were delaying, and Amao was of course one of them.</p>
<p>The third deadline (Note 1) had passed, and Uncle (Note 2) had come to urge him</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Kettle (continued)</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: Look at that puddle of mud dripping down from the fireplace, Eulalie. Now that’s a fine mess. Eulalie, why was my kettle stolen without anyone telling me? Perhaps you took it?</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: This kettle belongs to this family, Eulalie. Am I, Mr. Lepic, or my children supposed to ask your permission whenever we need to use it?</p>
<p>Eulalie: When I get really angry, I say stupid things.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: Are you angry at us, or at yourself, Eulalie? Yes, who are you angry at, anyway? Although I’m not really curious, I’d really like to know. You’re really putting me in a bind. You use the excuse that the kettle is missing, and you unhesitatingly pour a bucket of water on the fire, refusing to admit your own mistake, and blaming others, even me. I think I haven’t said anything wrong!</p>
<p>Eulalie: Carrot Top, my darling, do you know where my kettle is?</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: How would he know? He’s just a child who doesn’t take care of anything. Let’s not talk about your kettle anymore. I think you’d better think about what you said yesterday: "Once I find that I can’t even boil a kettle of water myself, I’ll get out of here immediately, without anyone having to push me." True, I think there’s something wrong with your eyes, but I didn’t expect it to reach the point of despair. I won't say anything else, Eulalie, just please put yourself in my shoes. You understand the situation as clearly as I do; please think carefully and draw a conclusion. Ah! Please don’t hold back anything, just cry as much as you want. It's worth crying over.</p>
<p>Words Unspoken</p>
<p>“Mama! Eulalie!”</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>What else did he want to say, Carrot Top? He would have made everything worse. Fortunately, under Mrs. Lepic’s cold gaze, he suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Why say to Eulalie:</p>
<p>“I took it, Eulalie!”</p>
<p>Nothing could save the old woman. Her eyes couldn’t see clearly anymore, her eyes couldn’t see clearly anymore. Never mind her. She would have to give in sooner or later. Carrot Top's confession would only have made her even more upset. It's better to let her go, better to let her not suspect Carrot Top at all, and just think that she was struck by an unavoidable fate.</p>
<p>And why say to Mrs. Lepic:</p>
<p>“Mama, I took it!”</p>
<p>Why take credit even if you did something praiseworthy? Why must you beg for a rewarding smile? Not only is there no benefit to this, but it is also dangerous, because he knows that Mrs. Lepic will scold him in public, so it is better to help her to the end, a better way is to pretend to help his mother and Eulalie find the kettle.</p>
<p>When the three of them worked together to find the kettle, he seemed the most enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic seemed to think it was none of her business and was the first to give up.</p>
<p>Eulalie endured and ran away, muttering in her mouth. Because of his caution, Carrot Top, who almost ruined things, also put away his strength, like a tool that was no longer needed.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Novel and Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Someone asked me how to write a novel. It happened that I had a copy of Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals stacked on my desk, and I said with a smile: "This is the encyclopedia of novels. Reading one volume of Zuo's Commentary is better than reading a hundred novels by famous authors."</p>
<p>People suspected that I was joking, but I pointed out many pieces of evidence from Zuo in a serious manner:</p>
<p>Zuo's Commentary is detailed in military strategies and tactics, so it is a military novel. It is detailed in social shortcomings, so it is a social novel. Moreover, this blind Mr. Zuo Qiuming is the most gifted in writing about emotions; Wu Chen eloping with a woman and Xu Mei supporting her husband are romance novels. Ai Jiang crying and calling to the heavens in the marketplace is a tragic novel. Ji Qian refusing to marry and Zhong Jian betraying me are chivalrous novels. Two sons throwing themselves into the river and Lady Shi making a vow are melodrama novels. The New Terrace giving rise to slander and Ai Jia composing a song are scandal novels. Zhongzi's hand pattern and Yan Ji's orchid omen are bizarre novels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the crows in the Chu tent and the joy in the mulberry tree are detective novels. Ge Lu knowing the language of cows and Shi Kuang recognizing the south wind are science fiction novels. Zheng Qiao discussing souls and Yan Zi distinguishing harmony and sameness are philosophical novels. Ying Kao Shu leaving soup for his mother and Jin Ling Zhe thinking of his mother are ethical novels. The stone speaking in the state of Jin and the snakes fighting at the Zheng gate are supernatural novels. Dwarfs being defeated by Zhu and Yu En abandoning his armor are humorous novels. Other things, other things, countless other things, I will not say anymore.</p>
<p>This is me compiling a table of contents for Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, and it is also me advertising Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals; most young people like to read novels but do not like to read Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, thinking that Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals is dull; in fact, how is it dull? Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals is a good novel that is all-encompassing.</p>
<p>I wrote this article in the "Spring and Autumn" column precisely to arouse the readers' interest in Zuo's Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals.</p>
<h3>The Great Way Society</h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>In the border region of Jiangxi and Fujian, in the past two years, due to the ravages of the Fang-Shao bandit gangs, the people have been in dire straits. The so-called Great Way Society, which recites incantations and eats talismans to resist bullets, has emerged in response to this situation. This society's influence is not great, and people in distant places may not know about it, so I am introducing it here, with the intention of simply making some random remarks.</p>
<p>According to a man from Shangrao in Jiangxi: the leader of this society uses the recitation of incantations and the eating of talismans to resist bullets as a slogan. There is a branch in Tieshan, Shangrao. At first, there were only ten or twenty people, but then the society performed Taoist magic, which indeed had aspects that could make people deeply believe. As a result, people continued to request to join, and it became an anti-Communist organization. When joining the society as a member for the first time, a certain amount of membership fee must be paid, and then Taoist magic is taught. Every time they fought with small groups of local bandits, they first had each member recite incantations, draw talismans, and drink them down. Another talisman was attached to the abdominal wall. The weapons they held were purely large knives, spears, and so on, so the locals mistakenly called them the Big Knife Society.</p>
<p>The members of the society believed that bullets could not harm them, and whenever the Communists came to attack, they all rushed to meet the enemy. Each time they won, the locals became even more convinced. Recently, the society engaged in a fierce battle with a bandit gang in the Huating area of Shangrao, and they captured more than twenty rifles and several boxes of bullets. Guo Su, the county magistrate of Shangrao, heard about this and awarded them twenty rifles, saying that although the society was somewhat superstitious, it was commendable that they could capture firearms, and their bravery was also commendable.</p>
<p>Whether the society uses magic to deceive people or not, it can use superstitious psychology to inspire the masses to resist the Communists, which is not comparable to the Miao and Yao people who use "Revive the Miao and Destroy the Han" as a slogan. Therefore, I am happy to introduce it here.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Linggu Temple</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The mountains of Jinling, generally speaking, are mostly majestic but not graceful, steep but not secluded; bare and barren, giving people a not very good impression. But the scenery of Linggu Temple cannot be considered an exception. This place is only one or two li away from the Zhongshan Mausoleum, and it is located on the eastern foothills of Zhongshan Mountain, with deep bamboo groves and dense forests, and winding paths leading to secluded places. Looking from afar, an ancient temple is surrounded by thousands of peaks piercing the sky and ten thousand pines forming waves, resembling a natural landscape painting; the atmosphere is ever-changing, leisurely and silent, making people can't help but yearn for it!</p>
<p>Now, with spring turning to summer, a person placing himself in this rare environment will not only have a refreshed perspective, but also smell the fragrance of wild grass and idle flowers, which will make his mind feel free and happy! Although there are not many peonies and peonies in Linggu Temple, they have caused a sensation among the people of the capital, and on weekends and holidays, people take the mausoleum tour buses to Linggu Temple at lightning speed; making the Confucius Temple and Xuanwu Lake lose their luster!</p>
<p>This Linggu Temple, some people compare it to the Longhua Temple in Shanghai, and others say that it is similar to the Zhaoyin Temple in Zhenjiang. But I think that only the Lian Temple on the shore of West Lake in Hangzhou can be compared. As for the famous Lingyin Temple, it may even be inferior!</p>
<p>Behind the temple is the Baogong Pagoda, which is said to be the location where the bones of Zhi Gong are buried. It is now being completely rebuilt and renovated, and the majestic nine-story pagoda will become the tallest steel-concrete stone pagoda in Jiangnan; the project has been underway for two years, and it is already quite impressive.</p>
<p>It is said that there is a stone tablet there, on which is painted an image of Zhi Gong, which is the handwriting of Wu Daozi, and there is also an inscription made by Li Taibai; and Yan Lugong personally wrote the title; collectively known as the "Three Perfections Tablet". Recently, when many of us went to visit, we never saw it. I don't know where it has gone?</p>
<h3>I Want to Study Veterinary Medicine</h3>
<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>Veterinary medicine is an official title. It belongs to the Tianshi of the Zhou Rites and is in charge of treating animal diseases and sores. Now, all countries have veterinary medicine specialties; like the veterinary school attached to the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center. But in civilized, progressive, and scientifically developed countries, they not only promote the health of their people's bodies and minds, but also promote the health of animals; what about our China? Last year, there was a large outbreak of cholera and bubonic plague in Shaanxi; not to mention other things.</p>
<p>The countryside is full of sick chickens, sick dogs, sick pigs, sick cattle, sick sheep, and black sheep; recently, I wanted to study veterinary medicine; if I become a veterinary expert, I will go back to the countryside and treat them in a practical way; to make them change their beastly hearts and become trustworthy, loyal, things that can be loaded with things, and meritorious ox brothers, the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>If (again, if) my goal is achieved, then I will further study to become a hunter; I do not hope to chase the deer in the Central Plains; but I want to shoot down the eagles, falcons, and drug lords that startle from the high sky, and the jackals, wolves, foxes, and swarms of rats that run rampant in the mountains and fields.</p>
<h3>Learning Pills</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Since the method of requiring junior and senior high school students to lightly pass the qualifying exam was stipulated, the "Essential Readings for the Qualifying Exam" have been produced in the market. The qualifying exam not only examines the last semester's coursework, but all coursework at each stage must be tested, which is recognized as a difficult hurdle for students, and the "Essential Readings for the Qualifying Exam" are naturally welcomed by them. All kinds of textbooks read over the years can be put on the shelf, just take a simplified and simplified "Essential Readings for the Qualifying Exam", and intensify your efforts to embrace the Buddha's feet temporarily day and night, and you can boldly go to the exam.</p>
<p>Some people say: Simplified qualifying exam books are easier to read and remember than complicated textbooks, but after all, you still have to read and remember them. It is best if our scientists can invent a kind of learning pill, take the essence of party ideology, and make party ideology pills. Take the essence of Chinese language, and make Chinese language pills. Other mathematics, history, geography, chemistry, physics, foreign languages, etc., can also be made into scientific pills. If you want to understand party ideology, you only need to buy a party ideology pill, dissolve it in boiling water and take it, and you will become a party ideology expert. If you want to understand Chinese, mathematics, English, and other subjects, you can do the same. Isn't this the most scientific method that does not require reading and memorizing? And the students will definitely buy silk and embroider the image of the inventor of these learning pills, and put this image above the portrait of our Mr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>That person also said: These learning pills can be divided into two types: one for each subject and one for mixed subjects. Whether it is for each subject or mixed, it can be divided into three grades: elementary school, middle school, and university. The prices of each subject pill are slightly lower. Mixed learning pills are made by mixing the essence of each subject, and by eating one pill, you will understand each subject, and one person is omnipotent, so the price can be sold high, and the three grades of large, medium, and small have their own prices.</p>
<p>I hope that these learning pills can be realized in the shortest period of time, because it is of immeasurable merit to people and of infinite benefit to oneself, and in the history of invention in the world, my page, although no one pays attention to it now, will become the most important page from now on.</p>
<p>Full-Length Novel</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Cold Observation of Sweet and Bitter Love Affairs from Two Sides; Three-Year Agreement on a Rough World Path</p>
<p>Gui Zhi unknowingly finished eating a bowl of lotus root flour. Thinking that if she didn't speak again, the opportunity would pass, she smiled shyly at Ji Zhi. Ji Zhi smiled back when he saw her smile. Gui Zhi asked: What are you smiling at? Ji Zhi smiled and said: Whatever you smile at, I smile at. Gui Zhi blushed, picked up a piece of sponge cake from the fruit plate and looked at it, but still put it down. Ji Zhi said: If you want to eat it, just eat it, why are you being so polite? Gui Zhi shook her head and said: I don't want to eat anything. I didn't come here to eat. Ji Zhi smiled and said: You didn't come here to eat, what did you come for? As he spoke, he tilted his head and looked at Gui Zhi's face. Gui Zhi smiled and hid her head under her arm, raised it, and said seriously: I have a serious question to ask you, can't you live separately from your brother? As soon as Ji Zhi heard this, he knew there was another deeper meaning, and said: If I can be financially independent, of course I can live separately from my brother. Although my brother is very strict with me, he has brought me up from reading to now, and I can't help but obey him. Gui Zhi couldn't say anything for a long time after hearing this, holding the copper spoon for scooping lotus root flour in her hand, she kept drawing in the empty bowl. The other hand supported her half-tilted head. Although she didn't say anything, seeing her appearance, she knew that she was very unhappy. Ji Zhi smiled at her and said: What do you mean? Gui Zhi pouted and said: What do I mean? She answered Ji Zhi's words, but her eyes were looking into the empty bowl. Ji Zhi said: I understand what you mean, and I am very grateful for your kindness to me. Generally speaking, I should immediately make a pact with you and work together. But I don't have any savings on hand now. If we cooperate, I will definitely fall out with my brother, and my job will naturally be lost along with it. Then, what will I do in the future? If you believe me, please wait for me for three years. During these three years, I will definitely think of a way. However, three years is a bit too long. Are you saying that I am shirking my responsibility? (69)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>The Cleverness of Birds</h3>
<p>One day I saw a small crow. It wanted to drink the water in the bottle, but the water in the bottle was shallow and its beak was short, so it couldn't drink it at all. It stood by the mouth of the bottle, thinking and thinking, and came up with a way. It held small stones in its mouth from the ground and threw them into the bottle, so that the water in the bottle gradually rose, and then it could drink it. If children keep mountain sparrows at home, they can try to see if the water in the cage is shallow, and the mountain sparrow will definitely throw the sand shells of the food in the cage into the bottle.</p>
<h3>Animals that Can Stand Upright</h3>
<p>Among all wild animals, only bears can stand upright on their hind legs like humans, because the soles of the bear's hind feet are exactly the same as those of humans. Although apes can stand upright, the soles of their hind feet cannot fully touch the ground, so they cannot walk like humans. All other animals stand on the strength of their toes.</p>
<h3>The Use of Airplanes</h3>
<p>We need to know how many kinds of uses there are for airplanes now? Roughly speaking, the following fourteen kinds can be included. (1) Military use, (2) Fishery (detecting the location of fish schools), (3) Transporting special goods (such as fresh fish, news, letters, mail), (4) Exploration, (5) Watching over mountains and forests, (6) Searching for maritime disasters, (7) Propaganda advertisements, (8) Surveying (investigating water sources, organizing cultivated land, laying railways, etc.) (9) Rescuing lives (dropping food supplies) (10) Transporting passengers, (11) Agriculture (scattering seeds, fertilizers, insecticides) (11) Measuring meteorology, (12) Pursuing criminals, (10) Animal husbandry (using airplanes to chase livestock when they leave the fence)</p>
<h3>Western Woman</h3>
<p>A white cloth towel can be used to make an interesting Western woman figure, as shown in the diagram below. In the first picture, first tear open both ends of the cloth towel and make two thin sticks as shown in the figure.</p>
<p>In the second picture, tie a knot in the lower part of the middle to form the body, two legs, and a skirt.</p>
<p>In the third picture, cut open both sides of the paper above the body, pull out the middle stick to form two hands, and finally make a face, but the head and face must not be too large, and if it is too large, cut off a little.</p>
<p>In the fourth picture, there is still a knot to make a hat, and all the useless parts are completely cut off, and then it becomes the Western woman figure in the fifth picture.</p>
<h3>The Donkey's Loyalty</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>About thirty li outside the city of Beiping, there is a small village. There is an old man named Long in the village. One day, he rode a donkey to Beiping to go to the market. On the way, he suddenly met robbers, and the money, goods, and the donkey he was riding were all robbed by the robbers. Later, after half a year, the donkey suddenly carried a child back to the Long family, and the people in the Long family were extremely surprised. The child was only six or seven years old. The people in the Long family asked him in detail about his name and address, thinking of sending him back the next day. Unexpectedly, the child's father was the robber who had robbed Long's property. When he saw Long personally sending his son home, he was not only extremely panicked, but also extremely grateful. He returned the property he had robbed from before, doubled, and begged Long to spare his life, and swore that he would never be a robber again. Seeing his sincerity, Long did not pursue the past. As for why the donkey carried the child back to the Long family? It turned out that one day, the robber's son rode the donkey outside to play. The donkey recognized the road and thought of its former master, so it took the opportunity to carry the child back.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Copper Coins Stabilize After Decline</h3>

<h3>Securities: Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Peace and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Bond Market Re-Emerges in a State of Chaos</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market at the Chinese Securities Exchange still showed signs of turmoil. Japanese planes repeatedly reconnoitered Peiping, causing anxiety among the people and creating a sense of impending doom. The defenses of Miyun were at risk, and if they were to fall, the enemy would have no obstacles. It was uncertain whether Britain and the United States would speak up righteously, but at this time they remained silent. Therefore, if the situation were to escalate, the future of the bond market would be fraught with storms. However, the general bullish sentiment was very strong, and the support was substantial. When market prices fell significantly, they would step in to support it, as evidenced by past events. In the early morning session, the initial market prices could not maintain their original levels due to the renewed reconnaissance by enemy aircraft over Peiping, which caused continued apprehension. However, as the selling pressure from the northern group subsided, the market prices only fell by a small amount, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 to 0.4. Trading in the second session was light, with the No. 16 bond slightly in demand, and the 1922 bond rose by 0.2 to 0.3, while the rest also improved by 0.1 to 0.2. In the afternoon opening, retail investors sold more, with the 20 bond falling the most, by 0.3 to 0.4, while the rest also fell by a small amount, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2. However, the demobilization bond showed a slight improvement of 0.05 or 0.1. The situation was chaotic, and trading at the close was light, with the trend slightly disordered. Market prices fluctuated up and down, only by 0.05 or 0.1. The results showed that except for the forward demobilization bond, which rose slightly by 0.1, and the entire six bond, which rose by 0.2, the rest all retreated by 0.1 to 0.2 to 0.5 to 0.6. Overall, the bullish sentiment showed signs of struggling, and changes were expected soon. The total trading volume was 6,569,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot, 1,350,000 yuan in futures salt tax, and 1,140,000 yuan in unified tax and demobilization, with the rest ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Prices Mixed</h3>
<p>A report from New-Fung Foreign Firm states that on Friday (12th), the selling pressure from bullish positions in the New York stock market was exceptionally strong. However, due to positive commercial news from various sources, the decline was minimal. In the last hour, the market rebounded due to the unanimous agreement on the tariff negotiations. Traders anticipated that American Telephone and Telegraph Company's dividend would be paid in full, and the stock once rose to 108.375. The domestic copper price rose to 0.07, which was the highest peak of the year. The total stock trading volume for the day was 4,560,000 shares.

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton Continue Rapid Advance</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened in the morning with a relatively calm situation due to the mixed performance of U.S. cotton. The second session was still weak, but in the third session, rumors circulated in the market that it was favorable to buyers, and the atmosphere suddenly tightened. People's sentiment shifted, and the closing price was raised by a major player, causing a sudden surge. In the afternoon, there were still retail investors buying to take long positions.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn for This Month Continues to Rise by 3.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Man-branded yarn suddenly tightened due to rumors from the factory side that they wanted to stop night work and that central government loans were promising. Buyers increased, and the price surged. In the afternoon, it was heard that sales to customers had not improved, and the tax situation slightly eased. However, there were still retail investors buying. Throughout the day, prices rose by 1.8 to 3.3 yuan for all months. The trading statistics were 79,000 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Stable, British and Indian Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was mixed, initially weak due to bullish positions taking profits, but later rose due to mass buying.

The Liverpool cotton market spot prices rose 7 points, and futures rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 12 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose because U.S. cotton went up, and market sentiment was good. Speculators and European exporters bought, and shorts covered, causing prices to rise.

<h3>Silkworm Rearing Flourishes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Yixing) In recent years, farmers have repeatedly failed in silkworm rearing, and the rural economy has collapsed. Everywhere, there are people who cannot afford to raise silkworms this year. In addition, it is difficult to borrow silkworm capital. Therefore, silkworm farmers have borrowed capital from township offices to purchase improved breeds for rearing, but the amount of rearing has been greatly reduced. The areas of Fufeng Bridge, Baojia Village, Heqiao, Caoqiao, Songdu, Nandu, Lidu, Guancun, Yiziyu, Yangxiang, Xushe, and Qingbaili are relatively smooth. Statistics show that the number of silkworms reared has decreased by about one-third compared to last year. Fortunately, the weather is sunny and warm, and the silkworms are developing well. With the help of instructors, they are developing smoothly. The early batches have completed their third molt and are feeding on leaves. Some are entering their fourth molt. The next batches have just completed their third molt and are feeding on leaves. The latest silkworms are only in their second molt and have been feeding on leaves for three or four days. The current situation is excellent.</p>
<p>(Nanxun) This is a famous area for producing silk thread. In the past, the Silkworm Sericulture Improvement Association sent graduates to establish guidance stations in nearby villages, distribute improved breeds, and guide rearing according to law. Therefore, the results have been remarkable in the past, and farmers have deep faith in improved breeds. The amount of rearing has increased this year, with almost all farmers rearing improved breeds. The weather is sunny and warm, and the silkworms are developing even better. The early batches are about to emerge from their third molt, while the next batches have been feeding on leaves for many days after their second molt. The latest batches are still in their first molt and feeding on leaves. If the weather does not change afterwards, the spring cocoon harvest is expected to increase compared to last year.</p>
<h3>Sui'an Zhen Mei Tea Slightly Firms and Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai tea market, the British firms Tongfu and Xiehe were still very interested in Zhen Mei green tea from Sui'an. Because of the lack of inventory in the market and the scarcity of supply, selling prices have risen slightly compared to before. Local Zhen Mei tea is also quite popular. However, because raw tea prices in the production areas were expensive before, and foreign firms were closed and did not open the market, tea factories have purchased very little. Therefore, there have been no large new samples released in recent days, resulting in supply not meeting demand. However, the Wenzhou Zhen Mei tea market is slightly weak.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rare Arrival of Lower River Rice, Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from the 20th and 30th were slightly sold, and the market seemed to stabilize, but people's sentiment was still depressed. Therefore, it was still not easy to promote sales for the time being. Fortunately, supplies were scarce, and sellers tried their best to tighten prices. Therefore, even though buyers wanted to cut prices, they could not. Prices for Jiangsu, Tongbang, and Nangang rice stabilized, with only the Nanyang Xinghua Bang purchasing 300 to 400 bags and 200 to 300 bags from this street. Therefore, prices for thin rice such as Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sijing, and Xilian continued to fall by a few cents. Duyangjian was sold sluggishly, with prices down by a few cents. Bianyinyuan arrival and sales were balanced, and the market was neither prosperous nor declining.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 ships arrived from Lower River. The market for white glutinous rice in the morning lacked transactions. The market softened slightly in the afternoon as shops made purchases. The market price fell by about 0.1. Thin glutinous rice and early rice were also down slightly, but the supply of Yangdujian continued. The road was still not bad, and the market was stable at a high level, with intermediate grades showing a weakening trend. Bianyinyuan was lacking in arrival, and Bianyuan arrival and sales were balanced. High-quality goods were being picked up in the market, and intermediate grades remained stable.</p>
<h3>Customer Groups Actively Purchase Small-Size Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer groups actively purchased rice again. The Fuzhou group actively purchased coarse rice, machine-milled rice, and foreign rice. A total of 5,000 bags of small-size rice were sold throughout the day, divided among the Fuzhou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo groups. High-quality goods were priced at 7.55 yuan, and intermediate grades were priced at 4.49 to 4.45 yuan. With such active demand from customer groups, market prices could have been raised by several cents, but sellers were eager to sell, so prices did not rise. Customer demand for machine-milled coarse rice was active. A total of about 6,000 bags were sold throughout the day, including 275 bags of Quanzhou machine-milled late rice destined for Jiangxi, priced at 8.25 yuan, and 50 bags of Hunan machine-milled Yuan rice, priced at 9.5 yuan. The rest of the rice was purchased by the Fuzhou group, including 200 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice, priced at 8.85 to 8.65 yuan, 1,500 bags of coarse oil rice, priced at 7.68 to 7.4 yuan, 100 bags of machine-milled red rice, priced at 8.12 yuan, 3,000 bags of coarse red rice, priced at 6.9 yuan, 230 bags of oil rice, priced at 7.45 to 7.23 yuan, and 734 bags of Jing rice, priced at 7.12 to 6.85 yuan. Compared to the previous market, prices were mixed, with some rising and some falling. Because some sellers were depreciating prices to sell due to the hot weather, high-quality rice lacked price hikes, and the quality of the goods also varied. The average overall price was still close to the previously quoted price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Have Large Transactions in Sesame</h3>
<p>The sesame market has been brewing for a long time, mainly due to small sales. Fortunately, foreign firms have been inquiring one after another, so sellers' minds are still set. Yesterday, Yihe Foreign Firm and two or three other firms had demand, and the total market traded 500 to 600 tons, priced at 7 taels and 6 qian, equivalent to 10.63 yuan per yuan. The market has seen a turning point, and it is inevitable that there will be a shortage of clean goods. If the downstream can be connected, the future of the sesame market is quite promising.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Revolved with Softness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a flat and weak revolving trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat was about 0.05 lower for sesame and 0.2 better for camphor. Therefore, the sentiment for each month after the quotation was still depressed, and transactions were not very smooth. Currently, the actual sales are affected by the increasingly serious situation in the north, and the silence of customer groups is expected. Due to financial relations, each mainland group has little activity. Therefore, only local brokers in Shanghai had some activity in the market throughout the day. Factories also had difficulty selling and were all watching, so there was a slight weakness in the rotation. As a result, this month was unchanged, June was down 0.0025, July was up 0.0075, August and September were down 0.0025, and October was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Future Wheat Market Mostly Short Selling</h3>
<p>丨New Wheat from Hankou Should Be Available in Half a Month丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend for each month of the future wheat market was even more depressed. Only August had some transactions throughout the day, and the rest were revolving and short-selling, a state of coldness that was unprecedented. In the afternoon, the result was down 0.01 compared to the previous day. As for the situation of new wheat, according to the Hankou group, it can be launched in another two weeks. According to current estimates, it can be bountiful compared to previous years. As for the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway area, it will be available by early June.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Native Cotton White, Sliced Green All Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the sugar market's standard gold rose, today is Sunday, and there were not many importers, so the trend remained flat. The Association's standard price for 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods was 20.2 yuan, and there were some transactions. The 20 medium sand white was 19.6 yuan and did not sell. The 89 Dutch red was 16.1 yuan, and there was a severe shortage of sellers. Changxing Firm sold 500 bags of RA cotton Dutch white, priced at 21.35 yuan. It also opened Guanghua Sugar Factory's Lu character at 20.045 yuan and Shou character at 19.95 yuan. The ground sand plus Guangdong bag was 20.06 yuan. It was found that the Java 24 coarse flower's standard price C.I.F. Shanghai was around 4 guilders and 15, and recently the Fine Art Association has a standard price. The foreign tax price is only 4 guilders, which shows that Shanghai's sugar trade is already trading against the origin price. If based on the current quoted spot price, the anti-discount is even greater. Observing the market trend, it does not seem to change much. The number plate has a Guangdong-Chaozhou gang opening 50 bags of No. 2 medium bag ice at a price of 22 yuan. The price of Ti Zhuang Qing was 13 yuan, which did not succeed. Zhong Zhuang opened at 12.2 yuan, and Zhengmian Red High-quality goods opened at 15.2 yuan. Hainan Red opened at over 180 bags at a price of 13.7 yuan. Sliced green opened at over a hundred boxes at 8.4 yuan. Because of the good quality, it was up 0.2 yuan. The factory's cotton white also showed a rebound. Zhenji No. 1 opened at 19.9 yuan, No. 2 at 0.7 yuan, No. 3 at 0.5 yuan, No. 4 at 0.3 yuan, and No. 5 at 0.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Golden Needle Vegetables Remain Tight</h3>
<p>The number plates for golden needle vegetables have remained firm recently and refuse to loosen. Yesterday, 60 to 70 bags were opened, with the higher price being 19.5 yuan and the next being 19.3 yuan, which was slightly higher than before. The street price also followed closely. Goods with bright color, dry body, and plump strips need to be sold for around 21 yuan, the next one at 19 yuan or so. Old vegetables are 8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Fabrics and Woolen Fabrics of Domestic Production Sell Well</h3>
<p>Among the domestic woolen fabrics, cotton yarn and woolen fabrics have been selling very well recently, such as Western-style suit head floral flannel, Yuanchang blue plain serge, checkered Tribute Huawei special flannel, striped plain flannel, white serge, striped serge, and other woolen fabrics. Cotton fabrics, such as mercerized twill flower feather yarn, white yarn twill white calico, yellow twill, bag cloth, Jiangshan lining, etc., have large transactions every day. Small customer groups and this street's business are also healthy. The retail business at the Nanjing Road Zhanghuamen City Department is also very lively. The demand for Western-style suits and Western-style materials is even greater. Nine-one-eight plain serge sells for 3.2 yuan per yard wholesale and 0.76 yuan per foot retail. The number one flannel sells for 5.5 yuan, the number two for 4.4 yuan, the checkered Tribute for 9.8 yuan, and the Huawei special for 5.8 yuan. Mercerized feather yarn traded for over 40 pieces yesterday, priced at 0.77 yuan. Non-fading fabrics add 0.05 yuan per yard. Defeng white calico is 0.54 yuan. Ningbo Jiangshan horse palm lining, 9-inch width, is shouted at 0.256 yuan.</p>

<p>Amateur Chat</p>
<h3>"Unemployment and Heartbreak"</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>"Unemployment and Heartbreak" was the topic that Mr. Cai Zimin, a veteran of the party and the nation, spoke about at the inaugural meeting of the "Shishi Club," 丨 an organization that evolved from a dinner party for discussing current events into a formal public organization 丨. As a reporter, I had the privilege of participating in the final seat and was fortunate to hear his famous remarks. Now I am very willing to share what I heard and my thoughts with the readers.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai analyzed the topic itself in great detail. He said: "Unemployment and heartbreak, on the surface, are very common problems in society, and not any specialized major problems such as politics or economics. However, their importance is precisely the fundamental object that all thinkers of education, politics, economics, and sociology, both ancient and modern, want to solve and study. But until now, this problem has not only not been solved, but also has an increasingly difficult appearance to solve. When we look at what is published in the newspapers, whether it belongs to political and economic news or the content of entertainment-oriented movies, they all directly or indirectly express the urgent need to solve this problem and reveal that the situation of 'unemployment and heartbreak' is expanding and tending to be out of control around the world..." Mr. Cai said that the only way to improve the future of these two problems is to maintain the current system. He believes that "unemployment" is a direct result of the current poor political and production systems in various countries; while "heartbreak" is a natural phenomenon formed by the family system centered on traditional thoughts and habits. Finally, he said: "But we see that the national crisis is becoming more and more serious, and at the same time, the number of unemployed and heartbroken people is also increasing. It seems impossible for us to call on these people to pay attention to the issue of national salvation. This is very worthy of our discussion and thought. I specially brought it up today to discuss with the gentlemen of the 'Shishi Club'. It is really not appropriate to call it a speech."</p>
<p>The reporter agrees with what Mr. Cai said in principle, but has a different sentiment regarding seeking solutions to "unemployment and heartbreak." We feel that the solution to this problem (unemployment and heartbreak) cannot be preemptively planned by benevolent gentlemen who already have food and lovers. It must await the masses of "unemployed and heartbroken" people to seek, fight, desperately, and sacrifice themselves after universal awareness, in order to enter the path of liberation.</p>
<p>However, the "unemployed and heartbroken" do not necessarily have to hate the "employed and loved." The common enemy of the "unemployed and heartbroken" is the system that causes "unemployment and heartbreak" and the few system "rulers" who hinder the "unemployed and heartbroken" from seeking liberation.</p>
<h3>My "Extra Income" in Life</h3>
<p>— Gensheng</p>
<p>Pastry Vendor</p>
<p>That morning, at half past four, when the first whistle of the cotton mill sounded, I got up and started a vigorous fire with the white charcoal in the stove. I placed it under the pan, smeared some lard on the pan, and then placed the pastries on it. Soon, a crackling sound started to emerge. By the time the third whistle of the cotton mill sounded, I quickly took out the steamer, attached the pan in front, and formed a carrying pole – a pastry vendor's pole. I carried it out the back door and headed to the entrance of the cotton mill. Many vendors – some selling sesame cakes and fried dough sticks, some selling glutinous rice – were already there, waiting for the cotton mill workers. I joined in the hustle and bustle, shouting, "Two copper coins for a piece, hot lard pastries!" I was truly brave!</p>
<p>I actually shouted like that.</p>
<p>Well, business wasn't bad. In an hour and a half, I sold more than 150 copper coins worth of pastries. Most of the customers were "young girls."</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The sky gradually brightened, and the cotton mill had closed its doors. There were fewer buyers. "Let's go!" I said to myself, calmed my spirit, and felt unusually happy. So, I carried the pole and walked toward the area of Sibusar Road and Qiewen Road. I loudly sang, "Hot... lard pastries... hey!" The children in the alleys paid the most attention to this sound. They actually ran out, clutching copper coins to buy pastries. Some who didn't have copper coins had to imitate my tune and sing along. Turning corners and walking, the clock struck ten. My body also felt tired, and the charcoal stove took a rest on its own. "It's better to go back!" I estimated in my mind, "Let's go! Let's go!" I returned home, cooked two bowls of rice, a piece of preserved bean curd, spending eight copper coins for the side dish. After eating my fill and resting a little, I washed three pieces of clothing. It was almost half past one. So, I tidied up my apron, picked up the pole again, and ran towards Qiewen Road, passed Sili Road, Mogan Road, and went up Youdai Corner, earning a few copper coins from the children's hands. As I walked further, I saw a crowd gathered, and a Yangzhou opera was being performed inside a house: a mother and daughter, singing with great enthusiasm, sometimes pretending to cry, sometimes pretending to laugh. I didn't expect them to have such moving art. So I took advantage of this opportunity and sold a lot of pastries. "Two copper coins for a piece, hot lard pastries!"</p>
<p>The sun gradually set. I thought there would be a batch of business to do at the entrance of the cotton mill, because they would be off work at half past five, so I quickly picked up the pole and went there, resting the pole on the latter part of × Tun Road, waiting. Two children were circling around my pastry tray, looking very eager to eat pastries, but they didn't have any copper coins in their hands. One was very cute, so I took a piece of pastry and divided it between the two children. They were extremely happy. A little girl next to them saw it and shouted, "××! ×× (the children's names) are eating the pastry seller's pastries!" Sure enough, the children's older sister ran out, followed by their mother.</p>
<p>"××! Do you have no shame?" Their mother shouted like this.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, the amount is limited!" I replied at the same time.</p>
<p>They said, pulling the children and going inside. The man-eating monster's sound in the cotton mill roared again, and the side door opened, and thousands upon thousands of laborers squeezed out, pushing each other. I hurriedly picked up the pole and tried to do business, but those who inquired were few and far between, because they were preparing to go home to cook dinner and didn't need this snack. In the morning, because they had to rush to work on time, they didn't have time to cook, so they just ate some snacks in a hurry. According to the factory rules, it is not allowed to go to work after the deadline. This is the experience I gained.</p>
<p>It was almost six o'clock. I packed up the entire pole and went home. There was some leftover lunch, so I cooked some rice porridge to eat. Under the lamp, I calculated that I had sold more than a hundred pieces of pastry in the morning and afternoon, totaling more than three hundred copper coins. After paying the pastry shop owner two hundred and twenty-five, there was still a surplus of seventy-odd. This was the reward for today, barely enough for two meals of plain rice. Of course, the risk of being caught by the patrol police and taken to the station to be "fined" was not included in this calculation. It would be unfortunate if I suddenly developed heat rash on the road. As for the news material I obtained, that was naturally my "extra income."</p>

<h3>Lu Genrong</h3>
<p>— Muyin</p>
<p>Factory Manager</p>
<p>Lu Genrong hid behind the machine, his eyes darting around alertly. Between the middle finger and index finger of his right hand, he held a burning cigarette. Wisps of green smoke rose, circling unapologetically into the air. Lu Genrong frequently took long drags, blowing them away.</p>
<p>"Factory Manager!" Wan Afu warned softly from the side. Lu Genrong quickly stubbed out the cigarette, quickly stuffing it into his blue cloth pocket. Looking up, the Factory Manager's small mustache was already visible in front of the machine where he was working. The two piercing, rat-like eyes gave Lu Genrong a chilling terror.</p>
<p>"What's your employee number?" The Factory Manager asked simply.</p>
<p>"I don't have... Factory Manager..."</p>
<p>"The no-smoking sign isn't there for nothing! Dismissal for violators. No need to waste words. Quickly get out your employee card!"</p>
<p>"I wasn't smoking, Factory Manager!" Although Lu Genrong hated his poor luck today, because the cigarette butt wasn't completely extinguished, the green smoke from his pocket was still rising straight up, but he had to stubbornly deny it.</p>
<p>Folk Sayings</p>
<h3>The Reason Why "Labor" Cannot Be "Sacred"</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhen</p>
<p>It seems that revolution is for the benefit of the masses, so the so-called revolutionary figures are full of clichés like "revolution for the masses, sacrifice for the masses"; targeting the importance of labor, the four words "Labor is Sacred" are shouted even more loudly: it seems that without this, it is not enough to talk about revolution. After all, those who engage in revolution must have a timely golden signboard.</p>
<p>When "Labor is Sacred" was sung to the skies, it was precisely when the revolutionary tide was on the rise, and the revolution had not yet succeeded.</p>
<p>Now, it is said that the revolution has succeeded, but what we see is that "labor" does not seem very "sacred". Or in some places, you can still hear some voices close to "Labor is Sacred", but they are no longer coming from the mouths of those so-called revolutionary figures. Even if they sometimes release it from their mouths with a "poof," it is only limited to a "poof"!</p>
<p>So we can truly assert: "Labor is Sacred," besides being used as a golden signboard, is a check that has never been cashed. If you say otherwise, please look to the facts. The ancients said, "The sacred is inviolable" (human beings today also say this), knowing that the so-called "sacred" implies the meaning of inviolability. But the current "labor" is indeed violable. Where is the "sacredness"? Moreover, the people who violate labor are the same people who sang "Labor is Sacred" before the revolution succeeded!</p>
<p>Some say that whether something is "sacred" or not depends entirely on the conditions it possesses. For example, the "labor" of the past was revolutionary, so it should be "sacred", while the "labor" of today is counter-revolutionary, so it should not be "sacred". As for the criteria for revolution and counter-revolution, the interests of the simultaneous rulers should be used as a guide. For example, if you have a conflict of interest with the ruler, it is counter-revolution; conversely, it is revolution. Therefore, the Great Qing Empire and the Northern Warlords regarded "Sun" and "Huang" as traitors, while the current rulers respect them as revolutionary founders, just like revolutionary figures say that the "labor" of the past was revolutionary, while the present is counter-revolutionary. Understanding this, then the fact that the current "labor" is not "sacred" is not accidental.</p>
<p>Dear "laborers," do you also want to be a little more "sacred"? If you do, you must consider the interests of the current rulers. As for suffering a little "oppression" and a little "exploitation," it doesn't matter. Even if you can't survive, you must absolutely endure and implement "labor-capital cooperation" and strive to "increase production," otherwise, you will be suspected of being counter-revolutionary and cannot be "sacred."</p>

<p>The green smoke was still rising outwards, but he had to stubbornly deny it.</p>
<p>"Haha... Ha!" The Factory Manager laughed like a strange owl. "Take it out quickly, or your clothes will catch fire."</p>
<p>Lu Genrong knew that he could no longer argue, so he had to beg the Factory Manager for mercy. At the same time, he thought of his mother and wife at home, and he couldn't help but kneel in front of the Factory Manager.</p>
<p>"Get up! Get up! This is useless. I can't break the factory rules for you alone. If you don't report your employee number, I'll check it myself."</p>
<p>The Factory Manager walked angrily to the office.</p>
<p>The Deputy Factory Manager, sitting at the desk opposite the Factory Manager, was smoking a Bai Jin Long cigarette. Seeing the Factory Manager come in, he engaged him in conversation:</p>
<p>"Chinese cigarettes are ultimately no good. Today I'm trying this Bai Jin Long, the tobacco leaves are much worse than Little Club."</p>
<p>"Well, Chinese merchants are best at cheating, so nothing good can be manufactured!"</p>
<p>The Factory Manager relied on his own theory, so he didn't smoke Chinese cigarettes. He slowly lit his pipe, answering the Deputy Factory Manager while checking Lu Genrong's employee number.</p>
<p>The office door opened. The foreman, accompanying Lu Genrong, had just taken a step in when the Deputy Factory Manager's half-smoked Bai Jin Long was "hissed!" and sacrificed in the spittoon. After all, he was the real Factory Manager. The pipe was only temporarily placed on the side of the table.</p>
<p>"This is his first offense, and he has five family members, big and small, who rely on him to support them. Please, Factory Manager, have mercy and reduce his punishment!" The foreman pointed to Lu Genrong, pleading with the Factory Manager. Lu Genrong hid behind the foreman, watching the Factory Manager's face with hopeful eyes.</p>
<p>"Good! You're interceding for him? Let me ask you, what are you supposed to do as foreman? If workers' violations have to be discovered by me, then what else can we do all day? To be honest, I found this. If the Premier were to come to the factory and see it, you and I would both be in trouble! Since you're pleading for him, you can find him another job yourself. I don't need him here from tomorrow on!" The Factory Manager said a set of words. The foreman rolled his eyes and left without saying a word, leaving Lu Genrong alone, standing there like a wooden chicken.</p>
<p>"Aren't you leaving?" The Deputy Factory Manager seemed to regret his half-smoked Bai Jin Long and shouted as well. So Lu Genrong left with tears in his eyes. At the same time, two more matches were struck in the office, and the fragrant green smoke filled the room.</p>

<h3>Pawnbroker's Face</h3>
<p>— Jingxian</p>
<p>Working hard from the 1st until the end of the month, the boss looks so pitiful, like a charitable enterprise, digging out snow-white silver dollars from the bulging bag to pay salaries. Although it doesn't draw blood, after selling a month's worth of sweat and getting these salaries, to the boss, it is already extremely generous, but to us small employees, although we feel the pain of "not full, not starving," alas, heavens!... So every time our boss, who married three concubines, pays salaries, I always block the opening of my pocket on the way home, afraid that I will meet a friend with more than one hand than me, like Japan supporting "Manchukuo," coming to plan for the silver dollars in my pocket. Arriving home safely, my wife's face blossomed with smiles, planning to make a velvet cheongsam, preparing to go to Suzhou for a wedding banquet. My son jumped up and down, clamoring to donate two dollars to buy an "Aviation Save the Nation" badge. With great difficulty, I coaxed and deceived, resolving them one by one. I moved out the thirteen-level abacus passed down by my great-grandfather, and clack clack, calculating and calculating, rent, rice money, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tuition, favors, everything, exactly offset each other. A whim came to mind, and a flash of inspiration, oh no, the due interest hasn't been settled yet. The creditor's face is really terrible, what to do! Scratching my head, I couldn't think of a way, only to go to the "uncle's house inside the high walls."</p>
<p>Once I had the "determination," I moved forward towards the "consistent policy." Snatching sparrows and digging for rats, long gowns and short jackets, I packed a bundle, sneaking and dodging, afraid of being seen, I slipped into the ×× pawnshop, "eighteen months to full, five days of interest per month." Holding the bundle high in both hands, I placed it on the high counter like a storyteller offering tea. Poor people always run into bad luck, there was no coincidence. The pawnbroker just sat down to eat. The pawnshop rule is that the pawnbroker won't put down his rice bowl, no matter how urgent you are, it's useless. The pawnbroker I encountered was, of course, no exception. After he talked, said, laughed, and ate, enduring for twenty minutes, I thought, here it comes. Who knew that he wouldn't even give me a proper look, shouting to step aside, to wash his face and smoke a water pipe. After everything was done, he reluctantly opened my bundle. Looking far away in another direction, he said, "How much?" I quickly said, "Write thirty dollars." "All old, worth ten dollars at most." He pushed the clothes out while saying this. I wanted to say something, but he had already impatiently said, "Go pawn it somewhere else!" Saying that, he lifted up his water pipe again, not bothering to pay attention to me anymore.</p>
<p>This is called a "Pawnbroker's Face." This is an even uglier face than the imperial army massacring innocent civilians. But the fact tells us that recently, ordinary merchants imitate the "Pawnbroker's Face" in five or six out of ten cases, unless the customer who comes is a modern woman, or an "upper-class person" spewing out of a car. The bosses are doing their best to uphold the slogan of "attentive service." Unfortunately, the small clerks, who "can't die of hunger, can't eat their fill," think of the scene of "wife weeping with hunger, children crying in the cold," think of the embarrassment of going to appreciate the "Pawnbroker's Face," and are really unable to naturally suppress their irritable emotions, forming an unteachable "Pawnbroker's Face." It is true that it is "unreasonable" for small clerks to treat customers with a "Pawnbroker's Face," and it is necessary to "emphasize merchant education," "treat customers with politeness," but, alas, heavens,... What more can be said!</p>

<h3>Reading Club</h3>
<p>— Shaoyun</p>
<p>Among the average shop assistants, many are those who had to switch to the commercial world halfway due to family poverty and the inability to continue their studies. Although they no longer have the possibility of returning to school, their desire for knowledge is still very strong. In order to satisfy their desire for knowledge, they need to use their spare time to study on their own. But for self-study, the most difficult thing is: when you don't understand something, there is no one to ask, or you can't find out if your own understanding of a certain issue is correct. If you gather several friends who like to study like yourself and organize a reading club, then the above difficulties can be solved, because in this way, everyone can often study and discuss each other.</p>
<p>The reading club should ideally hold a meeting once a week to discuss difficult points in the books they are reading, or to discuss views on a certain issue. Because in many cases, what one person cannot solve can be resolved to a considerable extent after several people's discussion.</p>
<p>In addition to holding discussion meetings, debate meetings can also be held regularly, finding several debatable issues from the books they have read, or taking the more important issues seen in the newspaper, assigning certain members to argue for the positive side, and certain members to argue for the negative side, and holding a meeting to debate. This can train the organization of the mind, cultivate eloquent speech, and help oneself understand certain issues. Or, after everyone has finished reading a certain book, each person reports on their心得 reading that book, and their criticism of that book; because everyone has different opinions on a certain book, debates can also be conducted based on this type of report and criticism.</p>
<p>In order to increase the interest and progress of reading, academic lecture meetings can be held regularly, inviting people with rich knowledge to give lectures on academic or other practical issues. Before holding this meeting, each member must first have their own views on the issue to be lectured on, and then after listening to the lecture, they can compare it with their own views. If there is anything that is not understood, it can also be asked on the spot.</p>
<p>The reading club also has a good advantage, that is, saving money. For example, Member A buys a book "How to Study New Social Sciences", and Member B can buy "How to Study Emerging Literature" or other books, and everyone can exchange them and read them in turns. If a certain book is something that every member must have a copy of, then in the name of the reading club, buying several copies of the same book can get a discount of 10% or 20% off the marked price.</p>
<p>If the reading club is organized in a large store or factory, then a regular club publication can also be produced, and the content is to publish articles, book and newspaper introductions and criticisms, and reading notes. As for printing, those with economic means can use mimeograph, otherwise copying a copy and posting it on the wall is also possible.</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Summarizing what is said above, we can draft a specific organizational outline below:</p>
<p>(1) Members: This club is composed of those who are interested in studying a certain science (literature, social sciences or natural sciences, etc.).</p>
<p>(2) Membership fee: Each member pays a membership fee of × yuan per × month.</p>
<p>(3) Club affairs: The main club affairs are:</p>
<p>A. Eight-tenths of the membership fees collected will be used to purchase newspapers for members to read in turns. The remaining funds will be used as office expenses.</p>
<p>B. Divide into groups according to members' preferences for a certain science. For example, those who like form a literary group. (Most people recommend)</p>
<p>C. Each group holds a discussion meeting once a week to solve difficult points in books or on a certain issue.</p>
<p>D. Each group holds a debate meeting once a month to debate academic or other practical important issues. Debaters are taken in turn by the members of each group; the topic is jointly decided by the debaters.</p>
<p>E. Each group may hold academic lecture meetings at any time. The date, location, and lecturer will be notified to all members in advance by the group leader of each group.</p>
<p>F. Issue a club report once every ten days (or every half month). The content is divided into (1) articles, (2) new book introductions and criticisms, (3) reading notes, (4) publishing and literary news, (5) records of discussion meetings, etc., (6) club affairs reports...columns.</p>
<p>(4) Staff: Staff are elected publicly once every six months:</p>
<p>A. Book purchasing director: Responsible for keeping the club's book purchase funds and purchasing books and newspapers on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>B. Book management director: Responsible for keeping the books and newspapers purchased by the club, stipulating the order and time limit for each member to read the books and newspapers in turn, etc.</p>
<p>C. General affairs director: Edits the club report and handles all other affairs.</p>
<p>D. Group leaders of each group: Each group has one group leader, who is responsible for convening various meetings (as for the chairman of the meeting, it is taken in turn by each member.)</p>
<p>(5) Supplementary rules: When this club must be temporarily or permanently disbanded, all books and newspapers will be divided equally among the members.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>However, the above-drafted outline is only general. If the number of people is small, it can naturally be modified according to the actual situation.</p>

<h3>How Should Workers Maintain Their Livelihoods When Silk Factories Reduce Labor?</h3>
<p>— Discussion by Councilor A-Zhen</p>
<p>In last week's "Little People's Assembly," a proposal in French reminded me of a few important points. I am also a silk factory worker.</p>
<p>What we see in the newspapers, besides the Soviet Union, whether it's the old imperialist British Empire, the emerging "Yankee brand," the victorious "France," or the "red scars" who use airplanes, cannons, and poison gas to talk about "friendship" with my "of the same race" country, and the recent Germany with the imperial swastika flag, … all are filled with unemployed and starving masses, especially us workers. Whether East or West, we cannot maintain even a life standard similar to that of cattle and horses.</p>
<p>At this time, who do we workers look to to solve this problem? The International Labor Office of the League of Nations in Geneva? Everyone knows that it is just a few big ocean hooligans putting on a show for some backward worker masses. Petitioning the powerful? When has a petition ever been successful? Moreover, detectives, police, informants, enforcers, labor traitors, etc., are constantly monitoring us. Any "movement" is "rebellious," and extremely dangerous. Kowtowing and begging for pity from the factory owners? That is even more foolish. Capitalists in their cars, mansions, and with their concubines simply won't pity us slaves.</p>
<p>"For the benefit of all our workers, what is the right thing to do?" I think someone will definitely ask me this.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, all past facts have taught us that there is only one way out:</p>
<p>Unity is strength. All workers unite, organize their own labor unions, oppose labor traitors to deceive and sabotage, oppose non-workers who claim to be leaders, oppose layoffs, oppose capitalists attacking us workers, and strive to protect our livelihoods.</p>

<h3>"Half-Mother's" Tragic Cry</h3>
<p>— Ms. Pan Yongliu</p>
<p>I never expected my situation to become so terrible, and even more, I didn't expect that after graduating from high school, I wouldn't be able to find a place to make a living! Indeed! I have tasted the bitterness and joy of life. Last year's life as an elementary school teacher for one semester had already exhausted me, but the meager pay given by the stingy principal couldn't even solve my personal food and clothing problems. But now, I am not seeking or envying the lives of those ladies or modern misses, but struggling for survival, I had to leave everything in my hometown and run alone to this vast city. Deep in my heart, I held a twelve-thousand-fold enthusiasm and hope, hoping that I would not become a starving ghost on the road of life. However, until now, the lesson that reality has taught me is to never again indulge in that illusory dream. I don't even know how I have spent the time in this attic room this past month! Although sometimes I wander by the noisy road, but when I see the smiles of those leisurely people, the proud expressions of the ladies and misses, and the majestic sound of the flowing cars, my heart is filled with infinite sorrow and resentment. Driven and pushed by life, I have also searched all the friends I know, but the answers they gave me were mostly just a few indifferent words like "there is no way." This made me terrified of my future life. I thought, if this kind of life continues, wouldn't I become a lonely soul in a foreign land? Alas! Is this my destiny? In the past, I absolutely did not believe in the so-called fatalism, but now, the reflection that reality has given me makes me have to doubt it, and even more makes me unbearable, especially the innocent little life in my womb for seven months, does he also have any sin? If it continues like this, won't I be implicating him? Alas! Every time I think of this, the tears in my eyes are like a raging wave of ten thousand feet, surging out! In the past, I really couldn't have foreseen that the current society is such a picture, and even more so misshapen. The pain given to me by unemployment has made me deeply recognize and understand all the truths of the current society. But alas! The current predicament │ │ the little life in my womb is getting bigger day by day, can I still sit here and wait for death? Is there really no place in this vast society for me to make a living? In order to solve the problem of childbirth and current life, as long as I can find a job of twenty yuan a month, that is my only hope for survival. Based on the skills that education and society have given me in the past, such as: clerk, home tutor, proofreader, etc., I can do all of them, and I can also write short stories. To put it nicely, I am willing to serve the society wholeheartedly; to put it bluntly, I am willing to exchange my mental labor for this twenty yuan of living expenses. Gentlemen who need this mental labor, please reply in this journal.</p>

<h3>Concerts in Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Lingshan</p>
<p>New Entertainment in the Grand Opening of the Grand Theater</p>
<p>Before the Grand Theater was renovated, it used to rent out one performance every Sunday night to the Public Concession Municipal Council Orchestra to hold concerts. Now, the movies at the Grand Theater have not yet opened, but the concerts have already started last Sunday. However, what they used to play was entirely Western music, so the audience, except for a few music lovers, were all foreigners.</p>
<p>Recently, a Russian composer named Avraam Avraamovich, relying on ten years of experience studying Chinese opera in China, created a kind of Chinese-Western hybrid opera. He said that Chinese music has very rich and beautiful rhythms. It is a pity that the music style is short and there are too many variations, which makes people feel bored. If Western composition methods such as harmony, counterpoint, and modulation can be used to turn Chinese folk songs into long symphonies, it will definitely have a very good effect. Thus, the Fourth Symphony "Impressions of Hutongs in Beijing" and the mime "Qin Xin Bo Guang" and other songs were realized from his ideals!</p>
<p>It is said that these two pieces will be performed by the Municipal Council String Orchestra at the Grand Theater on the 21st of this month. The orchestra will be conducted by Dr. Mei Baiqi, and the mime will be directed by Mei Lanfang │ it is said that Mr. Mei is also preparing to show his face │ · The performers are Tang Xiya, Tang Hui, and film actress Yuan Meiyun and several students from Yucai Public School. This kind of novelty can be regarded as one of the best embellishments in the grand opening of the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Mr. Avraamovich also believes that Chinese musical instruments have too narrow a range and crude construction, making it difficult to express deep emotions. But,</p>
<p>If foreign musical instruments are used exclusively, there is no way to show the special timbre of Chinese musical instruments, so he advocates a combination of Chinese and Western styles, combining Chinese silk and bamboo drums and cymbals with Western musical instruments. Therefore, this performance can be said to be an unprecedented event. It will add a unique color to the Chinese opera scene. Mr. Avraamovich has many powerful people enthusiastically supporting him behind him. After the performance of this play, he is also preparing to organize a troupe to reform national opera, so that Mr. Avraamovich can concentrate on writing to realize his entire plan.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "New Year's Eve"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>New Year's Eve, the end of the year, is a solemn and cruel picture in the real Chinese society. Therefore, using this New Year's Eve as the theme of the movie is naturally very novel and appropriate. If we can deeply understand society and grasp the economic significance of the development of that real society, then we can have a thorough solution to this complex problem. However, in this "New Year's Eve" picture, we can only be told the surface of this phenomenon. It explains that the rich people dance, drink, are jealous, fight, and waste money on New Year's Eve, and at the same time it also explains that the poor people have no money to deal with creditors, sell their children, and even commit suicide in this year-end blizzard. But what is the conclusion? "People's hearts are not as they used to be," "the world is deteriorating," and the old scholar still has to give generously at his own life-and-death juncture, and the usurious money shop owner is also willing to do good deeds.</p>
<p>Obviously, "New Year's Eve" does not have a deep understanding of the economic structure. It does not understand the exploitative relationship of usury at all, so it has to ask the rich to be merciful to save people in need. As a result, there is an old scholar with a typical old moral character who gives away the money he got from pawning his daughter "generously and without expecting anything in return" to others (and he is still a gentleman who does not pick up lost items). Of course, these are all characters from the Country of Gentlemen in "Flowers in the Mirror." This kind of unrealistic plot uses old morality to solve this serious social problem.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this script is indeed very problematic.</p>
<p>However, I cannot ignore the progress of director Jiang Qifeng. Not only in terms of consciousness, he is gradually embarking on a new path, but also in terms of technique, most of it also makes us feel satisfied. He presents this relatively complex plot on the screen in a very orderly manner, and the entire picture is very beautiful. However, the plot is not tense enough, and there is no obvious climax. Although it should be a tragedy that teaches people to cry, it cannot move people's emotions. It can be said that there is a lack of inspiration. The most important thing is that he does not have a strict analysis of the personality of each character. For example, since Jiang Junchao is a righteous and brave young man who fights for justice in the play, he should be a resolute and strong character who would never commit suicide out of cowardice because of three hundred yuan. Then, he suddenly becomes brave again and instead persuades the old scholar to "struggle," which is very contradictory. As for the other actors, they are all properly directed. In terms of performance, Chen Yanyan is the most realistic and successful. Liu Jiqun plays a loyal old man here, which is much more appropriate than the humorous roles he plays. He Feiguang failed. Xing Shaomei is good.</p>
<p>There are other loopholes, such as flipping out a lot of banknotes in the tram in front of everyone, and being able to see the content of the dance hall on the road, Liu Jiqun holding the banknotes and not being afraid of others robbing him at all.</p>
<p>However, there is one characteristic of this play, and that is the success of the photography. This is rare in domestic films. There are few and appropriate subtitles. The setting also suits the plot.</p>
<p>In short, if we don't have to be too demanding on domestic films, then this is a work above the standard.</p>
<h3>How are Naval Battle Movies Filmed?</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>Most of the audience who have seen foreign naval battle movies think that they are taken from the actual scene; this method of photography is not only unreasonable, but also very uneconomical. Moreover, Europe and the United States, where the art of photography has reached the perfect state, how can they not adopt the most economical and practical method? I think there must be many readers who want to understand this photography method that they have always regarded as a mystery! Therefore, I specially wrote this article to share with you readers.</p>
<p>At present, in European, American and Japanese countries, naval battle movies are mostly made with a mechanical, very large rectangular bucket, with very small warship models floating on the water. As long as the mechanism on the side of the bucket is turned, the bucket of water will surge like the ocean during a naval battle. The small warships also shake because of this. Looking from afar, it looks like they are actually fighting in the ocean. The photographer takes this scene, adds a little embellishment, and that is the so-called scene of naval battle. Seeing it with your own eyes is still a bit similar, so don't blame you for watching it in the cinema after so many procedures, thinking that it was taken from the actual scene!</p>
<p>As for the planes flying on the warships, that's even more ridiculous; it's just a toy plane hanging on a thin rope and swinging on a bamboo pole. The audience cannot see through the illusion because the photographer's skill makes it so.</p>
<p>The above is just the long shot of the naval battle movie; as for the close-up shots, the characters taken are not really riding on real warships. That warship is made of wooden boards and iron bars, a part of the real warship. Where is the sea on all sides? Because the lighting is properly arranged, you didn't notice it. The rushing seawater is poured in from above and below!</p>
<p>Although a good method must go hand in hand with good art to achieve true success, so good photography art is indispensable here. Otherwise, it will be like "drawing a tiger but resembling a dog."</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Continental Department Store China National Products Company held a fashion show to promote national fashion. Mayor Wu's wife also attended, and famous ladies from Shanghai also came. More than a dozen movie stars, including Hu Die, Hu Ping, and Xu Lai, joined the fashion show, which won a lot of praise. This is a picture of Ms. Hu Die's new outfit.</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin's Quirks</h3>
<p>— Mu Zhu</p>
<p>Chaplin has a strange habit that is different from others in his life. His romantic behavior is simply unparalleled, probably based on his innate peculiarity and cultivated. No one probably understands his character except his wife (now separated) and his subordinates. Obstinate, cautious, stubborn, dissolute, and fanatical are the collections of several conflicting personalities that make up Chaplin's entire personality. On a certain day of filming, when the work was at its most intense, Chaplin said to his subordinates: "I'm too tired! Let's go to Europe for a walk." When they heard this, they immediately stopped all work and quickly packed their luggage for their master: because they had seen through the master's quirk. The next day, Chaplin really set off for Europe. From the perspective of ordinary people, don't you think Chaplin's quirk is strange? Also, Chaplin has a magnificent swimming pool built in his house, but he has never taken the plunge. One day, he was inexplicably happy, immediately changed his clothes, jumped into the pool and swam wildly, until he could no longer tremble, before he called someone to carry him to bed, and then said it was fun. These are just a few random facts, but they are enough to prove Chaplin's top-notch quirks. It is said that he has had as many as seven past lovers and divorced wives. Recently, the heroine of "Waterloo Bridge," Pola Negri, also had a love affair with him. What a blessing for Chaplin! Unfortunately, one after another, they broke up or divorced, causing a stir in the city. In the end, he is still a single man. Now it seems that he wants to try the taste of marriage again, and the opponent has also been found, but she may not have noticed the benefits of Chaplin. It is rumored that Chaplin is planning to shoot "Napoleon," intending to direct and play the leading role himself. Maybe he simply won't participate in the role and find someone else to do it. But when will this lucky character be found?</p>
<h3>Why Wear Skirts?</h3>
<p>— Wu Qingfen</p>
<p>I have seen many Chinese movies, in which older women or old-fashioned middle-aged women are always wearing skirts. This point in my mind raised a question: "Why do they wear skirts?" In China, during the Qing Dynasty, women's formal attire was a long coat and skirt, but it is still popular in the Republic of China era, so you can still see those older women wearing skirts on the street; but you should know that they only wear them when they encounter happy events or visit relatives and friends, and they don't usually wear them at home. But now I see in the movie that skirts are worn even during ordinary conversations between old couples, or usually at home, which seems unreasonable to me. Because movies are realistic, unlike new dramas. (Compensatory)</p>
<h3>Secrets of the Movie Novel (Secrets) (8)</h3>
<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>Shen Xiang walked away with a heavy heart. He was thinking in his heart, I hope they will still return to the countryside, far away from this colorful crowd. There, there is a rough life and hard work that can keep people on the right path and not have crooked thoughts. In Shen Xiang's heart, which has been through many hardships, this ease in a pile of silks and satins is much more dangerous than country life.</p>
<p>Because John's power is growing day by day, of course there will be a group of people who tend to flatter him. He naturally embarked on the road of politicians, because that is the only destination for those who own wealth and power. For several years, he has been purchasing everywhere, and parades are welcomed everywhere. In addition to a group of men who climb the dragon and attach the phoenix, there is also a group of women with great ambitions to seduce him, and this Miss Martinez is one of them.</p>
<p>Martinez's participation in the dance party at the Carden's house this time was not invited by Carden, she came with great ambition. Mary tried her best to suppress the grief in her heart all night, socializing among the guests, pretending to be generous and dignified. When it was late and the guests were gone, she couldn't hold on any longer. She slipped out alone and ran to a small living room, lying on a sofa, shedding tears. Unexpectedly, Martinez had followed her. Mary heard a low knock on the door outside, and she quickly wiped away her tears and opened the door. This Spanish young woman came in.</p>
<p>After Martinez came in, the two were silent for a long time. They were measuring each other's strength. Finally, Martinez opened her mouth. She said, "My only reason is that I love your husband!"</p>
<p>"That's not possible," Mary said calmly. "If you really treat him sincerely, how could you run to his house so rashly and humiliate him and his wife's family in front of so many guests and friends?"</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry about that. I misunderstood someone else's words. But the fact still exists, that is, I love your husband, and he loves me." As she spoke, Martinez pretended to be very respectful.</p>
<p>"I can't admit that either," Mary said without hesitation. "Of course, my husband was seduced by you, there is no doubt about that. You also look very charming. But that's all. I know my husband well."</p>
<p>"Do you know your husband?" Martinez said in protest? "Your husband needs happiness, freedom, and passion, but you can't provide him with it. You don't understand your husband at all. He needs freedom! But he said you definitely won't let him go."</p>
<p>"My husband... did he say that to you?" Mary said, trying to appear calm.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"He loves you... He wants me to release him so that he can marry you... but I don't agree... did he tell you this?"</p>
<p>"Yes." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The United States Exports a Large Number of Actors</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>The recent anti-foreign sentiment in the United States has aroused the resentment of many foreign stars, and they have automatically withdrawn. Recently, within a week, a total of fifteen foreign stars and twenty-eight unsigned actors have left the United States and returned to their hometowns. As for those who are preparing to leave, they are now countless. This is an unprecedented disturbance in Hollywood. Now the US authorities are also very panicked, fearing that Hollywood will feel a lack of talent and cause a business crisis, so the current anti-foreign methods have a motive for improvement.</p>
<h3>"Going to Shanghai" Notes</h3>
<p>— Tao Le</p>
<p>San Yi Company's Maiden Work</p>
<p>Rongji San Yi Film Company's maiden work "Going to Shanghai" will be released soon. Last week, the company's manager Zhang Ye'er and Wang Wuneng, Jiang Xiaoxiao, etc., made a private screening. Mr. Wang's and Mr. Jiang's funny movements are indeed worth seeing, and the interior scenes of the film are all shot with lights, so the light is also very sufficient. This film has now been sent to Beijing for inspection, and it will be released in Shanghai soon.</p>
