<h3>經濟會黯雲密布</h3>
<p>摩萊表示拒絶討論安定通貨</p>
<p>貨幣問題美法對立抗爭</p>
<p>歐用金國希望締結臨時協定</p>
<p>遏止通貨狂烈機波動</p>
<p>（倫敦）通貨穏定問題、依然爲世界經濟大會進行中前途利鈍之要素、此問題之决定、將使本週杪充滿種種之可能性、英國今日一方面不願加入歐陸派、而與美國爲難、一方面又亟欲求歐洲之安定、故英相麥唐納現置身於貨幣鞦韆之中、一端爲通貨膨脹主義之美國、唱通貨伸縮性之論調、一端爲擁護金本位之法國、作通貨穏定之呼聲、美國欲繼續其事業之勃興、而歐洲用金國則欲保持其金本位、目的不同、似難融合、</p>
<p>今後事態之發展、或將决於英相麥唐納在鞦韆兩端間之偏向、如英國不表示其願否暫時穏固通貨、則美總統未必肯允國　管理匯兌、以取締投機、顧無論如何、衆料用金國之代表今日將發表言論、重伸其互相援助保持金本位之意見、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今夜世界經濟會之運命、已握於美總統羅斯福掌中、設竟不能稍形讓步、則會中將有無期休會之動議、惟據華盛頓消息、美總統態度依然堅定如前、因此各國首席代表多準備束裝回國、暫留次席代表與顧問等主持代表團事務、俟美總統對於最後安定計劃有容納答復後、再行來英、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>空氣緊張中五用金國集議</h3>
<p>討論提交英美之草議案</p>
<p>要求阻遏貨幣狂熱投機</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日金本位國家法國·比利時·意大利·荷蘭·瑞士等國代有舉行會議、一時各方注意均集中於此次會議、後英國財政大臣張伯倫復加入討論、四週空氣尤爲緊張、（二十九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）歐洲五用金國代表今日與英首相麥唐納財相張伯倫及英經濟專家顧問羅斯等會商通貨穏定事、午後五時開議、迄夜間二時始已、午後討論點集中於生産、發言者大都言及金本位之維持、及保持金本位國之地位、此次集議有何决議、或有何發展、今尙未見宣佈、但聞關於通貨穏定之問題、已有不少進步、在此集議以前、用金國代表已有數度談話、荷蘭代表柯里恩與法代表龐萊尤形活動、聞英代表團已向大會之通貨穏定委員會提出說帖、但内容現守秘密、法代表龐萊在會議後語路透訪員、謂各代表現從事於草擬關於穏定通貨事、極切實而堅决之宣言、又謂用金國一致承認盡力保持其通貨穏定之必要、現正準備宣言、陳述其意見、英美如欲加入亦可加入、惟無論如何、法國宣言必將發表去、今夜消息、傳說用金國已成立一種暫時協定、但内容尙未公佈、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨各國代表集於經濟大會會塲時、心目中咸抱延會與否之問題、歐洲用金國舉行重要會議、討論提交英美之草議案、此會結果如何、爲衆所亟欲知者、聞經濟大會命運所　之議案文、措詞甚爲堅决、說者以爲謂此爲議案文、不若謂爲哀的美敦之較爲適當、據可恃方面消息、如英美不於此議案提出後一星期中聲明取締對於歐洲某種、貨幣之投機、則荷蘭與瑞士以及他國將不復與聞經濟大會事云、用金國代表之會議歷一小時半、至十一時三刻散會、當時空氣迄未和緩、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據現象觀之、用金國現所考慮之最後草議案、係依英國所提取締貨幣投機辦法之輪廊、衆信此草案如被通過、當可爲羅斯福總統所接受、聞此議案曾修正九次、每次修正後、距法國立即宣言實行穏定之要求愈遠、而距英國所提調和辦法愈近、其所以有此趨勢者、因意國傾向英國見解也、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日金本位國所提種種計劃、悉爲美代表團拒絶、迨於深夜、金本位國乃經由美代表團向美總統作最後申請、據英國擁護金本位之某君言、此係最後計劃、乃一遏制貨幣狂熱投機之簡單方案、實爲公開貨幣戰與實在安定幣價間之唯一可能的折衷辦法、内容建議英美合作在人力管理之制度下贊助金本位國制止投機、此項計劃係在秘密會議内草擬、麥唐納與張伯倫亦均出席云、（廿九日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）自法比荷等金本位國向美總統提出最後新計畫後、華盛頓方面不僅毫無足以鼓勵人心之佳音、且聞美財部中人及其顧問等、甚致對於安定之計畫、尙未嘗有一度之考慮、金本位國所提新計畫、現正爲會議休息室内談論目標、有一部份人認爲毫無意義、顯係一種保全顔面方案、藉以綏靖金本位國内輿論、免致小國實行退出會議之恫嚇耳、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透訪員詢經濟委員會主席荷相柯里恩、是否與英倫銀行成立妥協、柯氏答曰、吾人現休會至午後、尙未有最後决定也、午後會議定四時舉行、屆時英首相麥唐納與財相張伯倫皆將出席、午前英相亦曾與會、散會時或以晨會結果相詢、麥唐納答曰、吾人不過再作一度談話而已、今晨謠言甚熾、迨聞英倫銀行總裁諾曼赴南甘星墩與英相略談片時之消息、謠諑愈甚、英方現所遇大困難之一、爲英屬自治地對於英美貨幣兩相啣接之有力的趨向、彼等不願對佛郎固定英幣價格、如英幣不能與美幣聨合、則彼等主張將用金鎊之國團結而穏定之、聞英方尙有一困難點、爲財政部與英倫銀行意見之各異、傳說該銀行贊成歐陸貨幣聨盟、法財長龐萊本擬今午起程返巴黎、向内閣報告經過、現已展期至今晚、以待午後通貨會議之結果、今晨龐萊出會塲後、當然未有好消息傳往法國、渠語路透訪員、謂英國迄未有附和用金國之表示云、就法國對經濟大會之態度而言、巴黎下屆内閣會議將極關重要、因法國主張經濟大會延會與否之决定、將繫於龐萊之報告也、法國今日在其所發關於津貼事件之說帖中、一再申說通貨穏定、重要甚於任何其他事件、謂目前通貨之減値、乃最嚴重而最顯明之獎勵金、以其減低幣價、低賤國内之成本也、故通貨穏定之恢復、乃事實上減少津貼金或獎勵金之必要條件云、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>摩萊表示安定貨幣不願討論</h3>
<p>但允協力禁遏投機</p>
<p>（倫敦）聞摩萊敎授已通知英相麥唐納、美國現不準備討論通貨穏定事、但可與聞阻止通貨上狂烈投機波動、而不礙羅斯福總統行使其通貨膨脹權之國際匯兌計畫云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國務卿副摩萊來英後、仍完全未能疏解各國對於美金貶價反對、今日曾與英相麥唐納晤談一小時、麥氏切懇安定美金以救會議、但摩萊事後語新聞記者、仍未能商得同意、並以半失望之態度聲稱、安定幣價尙非會議主題、現信摩萊與英相會晤後、將於下次主幹部會議時發一重要聲明、一般人多信屆時摩萊將作挽救會議之最後企圖、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美財部發一正式聲明、否認財次亞哲生與預算主任杜格拉士曾與金融專家戈登韋塞會晤討論安定金元計劃、按自倫敦經濟會議陷入僵局後、美國即盛傳此三人倉卒會議、討論向世界經濟會議提出之對案、故財部特加否認、並謂亞杜兩人未曾考慮一討劃、惟外間對於此次聲明解釋互異、亦有謂此事完全歸總統一手處理、總統刻在北方、有無新訓令致代表團、此間不得而知、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>通貨難關黄金幕後尙有白銀</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美代表團今晨照常集議、但僅開會十分鐘、聞未討論穏定問題、惟摩萊敎授與國務卿赫爾美財部顧問史潑萊及美代表考克斯會商逾一小時、聞曾討論美國應採何種步驟、以解决黄金難關、第黄金問題非爲今日僵局中之唯一事件、蓋幕後尙有銀問題之難關在焉、美代表與印代表對銀問題意見亦復參差、印代表雅不願依美代表之主張、而以限制售銀之長期協定拘朿自已也、此外減少麥田之難題、依然不易解决、今晨各大産麥國復開會議、决定電致澳政府詳述一切、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>安定滙市準備襲用英國辦法</h3>

<h3>金元下跌美國當局不無惶慮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據言非無據之新聞電、華盛頓當軸對於美元之下趨、及其損害世界貨幣關係之影響、現漸不無惶慮、美國官塲現有以目前政策害多利少爲慮者、美國當局或將改其不妥協之態度、遷就暫時穏定計畫、而討論限制美元波動之方法、亦未可知、但此種意思之變更、非必謂羅斯福總統將依允關於貨幣之任何治標辦法、致碍及其提高國内物價之主張也、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>貨幣僵局影響英美外滙市塲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）經濟大會之僵局、已使外匯市塲之買賣者爲之中無所主、昨日紐約金元對英匯價開盤爲四元二角七分、後弱至四元二角九分、旋回至四元二角五分、抵補各項之成交數頗巨、但後又有人願以四元二角八分之價出售、其他貨幣價均穏定、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）金元價格今日在國際市塲漲落不定、致美國證券市場亦隨之變動不止、匯兌商人與金融專家對此漲落不定之原委、皆疑惑莫名、頗疑有專事投機者在幕後操縱、冀迫美國贊同歐洲主張、至今日美京對於倫敦安定問題之局勢、除財政否認外、並無他種評論、（二十九國民電）</p>
<h3>小麥問題各方異見逐漸銷除</h3>
<p>有成立臨時恊定可能</p>
<p>（倫敦）小麥問題今日似有臨時協定之可能、澳洲與其他産麥國間之異見、今已逐漸融化、今日午後五時小麥股員會開會、但旋即延會、未曾討論、因專家未有充分時間根據澳政府略改協定基礎之請求準備數字也、但專家對於澳政府最近之建議、將連夜工作、澳政府之建議、但可促成性質統一而適用可伸縮之協定、俟脫稿後、澳代表卜魯士將電致澳洲、以便提交澳州四大産麥省代表星期六日舉行之會議、供其考慮、目前事態、似澳洲可依允一種减少麥田辦法、但須輸入國不復厲行限制及進口限額、換言之、即輸入國不復保護其自已農業耳、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>日俄衝突危機</h3>

<h3>日本外交政策的轉變（日本通信）</h3>
<p>日本近來在外交上發生了一個巨大的變動、就是抛棄了他歷來的好友英國、而公然提倡與他的假想敵美國親善、事實已經明白表現出來的是印度澳洲等地、已相繼抵制日貨、恐怕將來凡是英帝國屬地以及自治領地、都會用加高關稅、來限制日本紡織物品及其他製造品的輸入、而日本則用不購買印度棉花和澳洲羊毛作抵制、但是這種抵制、似乎不能挽回印度及其他英帝國領導下各自治領·各殖民地·對日本的好感、反而激起更大的憤怒、使日本對外市塲、感受莫大的威脅、如果眞正實行的話、則比較在東方算是優秀的日本紡織工業、會遭受莫大的打擊、所以日本全國的工商界在東京·大阪·神户·等重要都市、到處集議、籌劃對策、但是直到現在、還是不曾找到眞確而能實行有效的方法、祇有用不買印棉和不買羊毛、作消極的對抗、</p>
<p>在政治上英國和日本利益、有很多相同、而且須互相提携的地方、特别是對付蘇聨、封鎖他向東方發展、其次對華政策、在壓制中國民族革命向上發達、他們也具同樣立塲、以聨合的步調行動、但是最近蘇聨對外政策、轉趨於和平的保守、英國於是放心他在印度的利益、和波斯油田、不致於發生危險了、同時對華市塲關係、英國也很明白地看出日本的急進主義、因爲起初日本祇說是保護「滿洲」的旣得利益、并且自告奮勇任國際的防赤先鋒、所以英國默許他的軍事行動、但是最近日本非特把滿洲變作了朝鮮第二、而且襲取了熱河、又進窺津東、并欲在津</p>
<h3>東京天花流行</h3>
<p>（路透三十日東京電）東京現今天花蔓延、故過去數日中約有一百萬人被迫種痘、當此症初發現時、衆誤認爲水痘、以致蔓延甚連、染者現達五十六人、小學校兩所爲預防起見、現已停課、</p>
<p>東製造第二傀儡、呌李際春郝　石鳳鳴這批人出名、先組起什麽總司令部總指揮部等等空名、而以日本預備役的將校、從中指揮、得便即進窺華北、縱不能成功、至少也可以就此提出交換減低關稅的條件、當然英國在開灤煤礦在北寗路的人、目擊這種情形、英國在華北的利益、因此動搖、何况日本在東三省與熱河駐軍、還準備着席捲内蒙和察綏呢、</p>
<p>因此日英兩國間的政治關係、就由聨合而分離了、日本如果完全没有了英國的援助、甚至英帝國内各地以關稅限制日貨、果眞實行、則日本將由名義上的孤立、陷於經濟上實質的孤立、這是日本所最恐懼、尤其是現時日本經濟情勢最難堪的、可是他絶不能採取對待中國同樣的手段以對待英國、然則他將怎樣辦呢、眼前救急的方法、日本曉得美國忙於整理他國内的一切、對太平洋上爭霸、並不十分積極、對中國市塲投資和輸出貿易、在質量上確又不同、日本對華輸出大宗是輕工業製品、其次是海産物、而美國則主要的重工業製品、農産品近來因爲特殊關係、雖陡然增加、但實質上美國與日本對華貿易、并不像日本與英國那樣子尖銳對立、日美兩國間、也還有多少可以調和的地方、例如日本需要鋼煤油、美國需要生絲等、在經濟上有求得調和的可能、所以自從印度加增關稅問題起來以後、就有一部分日本人、轉換了排美論調而爲親美論、即從前高倡對美作戰的人、現在也表示緘默了、其轉變的第一步、打開目前的僵局、消滅過去美國共和黨執政時代對日的痕跡、先從外交上着手、松岡洋右過美時、就埋伏了引線、盡力的求民主黨各領袖的對日諒解、現在正打算要呌松方幸次郎、或松岡洋右去代出潤勝次作駐美大使、則日美外交將另闢一新局面、雖然、這種局面的時間性、非常短促、日本與美國間的利益、終究不能　和、可是在目前却是求得暫時安定的一法、因此日本對華政策、也要另換一種方式了、（六月二十一日）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北兩問題梓</h3>
<p>停戰協定簽字後之華北問題其最近受一般人注意者。一爲跳梁於不駐兵區域内之僞軍如何解决。一爲馮玉祥樹幟抗日後之察哈爾局面如何收拾。此兩問題。前者本可視爲國内之剿匪事件。而最近乃不得不與其背後操縱之數軍代表商解决之辦法。後者表面爲抗敵禦侮之行動。而最近乃轉移其重心於國内之政治關係。惟兩者之性質雖不同。北平當局則鑑於問題内容之複雜。一以和平出之。其用心亦良苦矣。</p>
<p>李際春趙雷之徒。一面受日方之操縱。以擾亂灤東西各地。一面又假抗日軍名義。以掩飾其與日方之關係。即就表面言。不中不日。亦一乘機而起之土匪耳。北方與論。有根據停戰協定之原則。主張向日方問明李趙等之地位以求問題之解决者。以爲日軍如承認僞軍爲其侵入長城勢力之一部份。則依照協定。應一同撤至長城之線。如認爲無關係。則應允許中國軍隊剿除。此雖紙上之談。要亦不失爲一種促使僞軍問題容易解决之意見。若如日來報紙電訊所傳。僞軍旣達其要求收編之目的。更得留駐灤東。則問題即使解决。禍患依然未除。如此解决。仍不免有若干問題之問題。以遺留於將來。也當局辦理此事之苦心。爲吾人所知悉。委曲周旋。以免枝節之横生。亦自有其不得已處。惟收　後應如何使其變爲有幾分可特之保安警隊。留駐原地。應如何使其不妨碍於各地之接收。則當局所應早爲之謀。以免將來之糾紛者也。</p>
<p>馮玉祥於停戰交涉進行時。知國人對外之憤激。有加無已即宣言武裝保　察省。開始其非常之行動。此種行動之是否適當。可暫勿論。惟五月二十六日以來。歷時月餘。國人以未見其抗戰之成績。對其所謂「唯帮率部對外决不割據自雄」之言。已不免有所懷疑。吾人試以國人對於馬占山黑省抗日時之興奮情况。及對於十九路軍上海禦敵時之踴躍援助事實。與今日對察事之態度相對照。固不能僅僅爲馮之遭際發生感慨也。最近察局之癓結。在於馮氏之不願離開張家口。致宋哲元不能回察吾人以馮氏個人之留去。其事尙小。倘關係各軍。能如其梗電所述。出發前敵誠意爲收復失地之工作者。則宋哲元率部回鎭似無若何困難問題可言。察局之解决。亦似難而實易也。　　吾人所不能無感慨者。國難深重之言。日騰於衆口。而今日之華北乃。以此等問題。勞國人之注視然此等問題即使一一如願解决。於國難之銷除。有何補益乎。</p>
<p>中東路買賣交涉</p>
<p>俄僞主張大相懸殊</p>
<p>僞組織要求貶價收買</p>
<p>蘇俄要求海濱省保障</p>
<p>（東京）關於中東路賣買問題、日俄滿間之主張漸明、日俄之估價相差甚遠、據東報所傳、僞國即日方之主張如次、</p>
<p>（一）中東路軌道甚廣、闊五英尺、不便與南滿路直接通車、將來應改爲闊四呎八寸之路綫、其所要經費甚巨、</p>
<p>（二）俄方所提出之建設費四萬萬盧布、都市建設費及學校經營費亦包含在内、此項經營須扣除、</p>
<p>（三）最近路線甚荒廢、昨經大修理、不堪使用、在目前每月虧空達二三百萬盧布、</p>
<p>（四）僞國擬建併行線及縱斷線、其經濟上之價値甚少、</p>
<p>（五）自日軍入北滿以來、一切實權在關東軍手中、已失其帝俄當時之侵略性質、</p>
<p>日滿以上列理由、不願支出正當價錢、而俄方主張如次、</p>
<p>（一）俄出賣中東路、不但賣其鐵路、連一切之經濟勢力、亦從此撤消、故不能單以中東路自身爲其估價之標準、</p>
<p>（二）俄已自願退出北滿、日滿亦應從此停止對北樺太及海濱省之侵略、　　（三）中東路處於世界經濟恐慌之環境、尙且可以自持、目前之損失、其原因在日之軍事行動、故不可以此爲減其估價之理由、（三十日華聨電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）共黨機關報伊斯凡斯泰今日在社論内聲稱、出售中東路交涉、足覘日本在遠東有無和平誠意、並力闢此　爲蘇俄暴露弱點之說、謂俄政府在滿洲並無政治利益、僅有經濟利益、此項利益即以鐵路本身爲主義、又謂蘇俄不願被牽入勢力範圍之競爭、此事乃非蘇俄外交政策之所當有、嗣又闢日報所稱、俄將出售海參崴、及東部西伯利亞之說、目爲可笑謠言、謂日人造謠、用意乃圖减低蘇俄所索中東路代價八萬萬日金之故、蘇俄人民觀之當然不値一笑云、（卅日國民電）</p>

<h3>某外交家談日美締公斷約</h3>
<p>爲日方片面宣傳</p>
<p>（南京）關於日美締結公斷條約事雖經美官方　予否認、但日方仍再爲進行談判之宣傳、中央社記者爲此特往訪某外交家詢其觀察、據談、日本自退出國聨後、其外交政策顯已變更、日本在退出國聨前、一面因美國一再聲明不承認侵略之結果、一面英日間過去有聨盟之淵源、故日本此時之外交政策、係聨英制美、迨退出國聨後、英日間因印度關稅問題、引起嚴重之經濟衝突、日本國内排英風潮日趨激烈、即在世界經濟會議中、亦表露政擊英國之態度、可見英日惡感日深、將由經濟衝突、進爲政治衝突、日方爲避免國聨之孤立、乃轉移目光採取聨美制英政策、但美國之對外政策、不但傳統一貫、且有由門羅主義趨於積極主義之傾向、日方雖極盡聨絡之能事、企圖締結公斷條約、但向來毫無信義之日本外交、斷雖取信於美國、觀於美官場之一再否認、可見日方之宣傳、全屬片面的云云、（三十日中央社電）</p>

<p>合作運動特刊</p>
<h3>中國合作運動的出路吳覺農</h3>
<p>合作運動的目標是什麽？三十年前的米雷博士（Dr，Hnas　Hullor）d在第六回國際聨合大會中已明白地說過：「這是吾人在經濟的及社會的生存條件上，爭取獨立，爭取自由的運動。」雖然在當時曾經遭一小部分信奉基督徒式的「你須愛你的鄰人，」者所反對，但他的論斷，愈到了現在，便愈見其有意義，愈覺得有力量了！</p>
<p>自一八四四年，即距今約九十年前，英國的羅虚戴爾先鋒合作社成立以來，現在凡是人類所居住之處，幾乎都有這合作社的存在，全世界加入合作社的人數，已占了全人口的五分之一以上了。確實的，因爲牠是用和平的方式以爭取經濟的及社會的獨立自由的運動，不致於惹起資本主義的强烈的對抗。</p>
<p>但是話雖如此，我們一方面雖看到合作運動如此地發展，不過在另一方面，却各國各因其環不同，其内容與方式。英國的消費合作社·有特殊的繁榮，德國則爲信用合作社的有意義的發展，法國重在生産合作，比利時發展的爲保險合作，丹麥則爲牛奶鷄蛋等的販賣合作，這還是形式上的區分，最不同的，如歐洲的合作運動的發展，是由下而上，換句話說，是由人民自動的組織。東方如日本印度等國，則大都由上而下，即由政府的力量盡力爲之提倡指導。更如俄國則利用合作運動的方式，以完成其社會主義的基礎，如比利時則爲社會黨的武器，意大利與新近德國的汎繫主義者，且在威迫利誘，想把合作組織爲其部分的活動機構。所以合作運動雖瀰漫着整個的世界，而其方式已各有不同；合作主義者雖齗齗爭辯着各個的理論，其實則早已就各國的政治組織社會環境而各立其門户了。</p>
<p>中國的合作運動還祇有十多年的歷史，基礎異常薄弱，成績自絶幼稚，近年因農村瀕於破産，政府的相當提倡，似有幾分起色，但各國的合作運動，是隨了資本主義的發展而産生，中國的民族資本還十分地薄弱，都市的金融資本，也因現在内地的時局不靖，畸形地暫時的集中於都市，換句話說，中國的現狀，完全在帝國主義的金融資本家控制之下，所謂國内的金融資本，祇是國際的資本主義的附庸。所以中國的合作運動，决不能任意抄襲，而與各國苟同，這是毋庸諱言的事實。</p>
<p>我們不妨來舉幾件事實。近來多數的合作同志們，大都說中國的消費合作，没有發展的希望，今後應該注意的是農業合作。消費合作爲什麽不能在中國發展呢？事實是如此，中國人口，大多數爲農民。他們布衣粗食，本來是在自給自足的形　下，但現在受了幾十年來的帝國主義者及封建　毒的剝削，已都在半饑餓的狀態下，幾乎已談不到所謂消費了，所謂消費者祇是都市中的住民。市民的一部分是不生産的消費者，他們有空閑的時間，有餘裕的現金，本來買點高貴的貨品是「並不在乎。」而且都市中，有各種漏稅私販的貨物，有各國廉價傾銷的競賣品，價廉物美，自然没有組織消費合作社的必要。其他則爲不定住的職員，小商人，游民和工人，一則他們缺少反資本主義反帝國主義的意　；其次團結儲蓄的槪念，又是很缺乏，其三，還有更重要的一點，就是他們在封建的社會組織下過慣了生活，全靠賖買賒賣的方法，以苟延其歲月。所以消費合作的最簡單的：「消費就是儲蓄」「購買必用現金」的口號，終是格格不入。</p>
<p>但農業合作是否有希望呢？如其我們不能認定目標。不立整個的計畫，我的預料，也是没有好的結果的。</p>
<p>農業合作最重要最原始的組織爲信用合作。信用合作的目標第一爲社員的自行儲蓄，第二爲以全社的信用，向社外借欵。中國的農民，已窮到如此地步，祇有大部分的負債，怎能談得到儲蓄？至於向社外借欵，高利貸當然在排除之列，而目下各地農民銀行以及借貸所，不但資金薄弱，分配爲難，而且一分左右的利息，半載一年的短期借欵，是否對於農民有眞正的補救？怕誰都不能予我以滿意的答復。最近的金融資本，雖有投資於農村的企圖，但有否這力量已成問題，能否眞的給農民以利益，更成爲目下談農民經濟者的重要的欵問。</p>
<p>再來說産銷合作罷：現在的商業組織，複雜到萬分，農民能夠自行聨合作直接的販賣，自然可以剷除一部分的小商人的利潤，但最後的經手機關，仍舊在大都市的洋商以及大工廠之手他們的剝削關係不剷除，農産品的貿易，决無獲利之望。近年來米麥棉花的大量的進口，已使内地的生産者無復生望，更何妨一切的農産品價格，本來都在必要的生産費用以下。最近各國的合作運動者竭力使生産合作與消費合作直接聨合，其目的就是爲此，而中國的消費合作又幼稚如此，没有希望如此，則生産合作乃至産銷合作的希望的缺少，也可想而知了。</p>
<p>那末，中國的合作運動，應該怎樣的謀生路呢？這裏限於篇幅，簡單的來舉幾個綱要罷：</p>
<p>第一，應該由政府用全副的力量。例如金融方面，至少須有三五萬萬的流動資金，以最低的利息爲信用合作社貸欵之用。第二，關於一切的生産，販賣，以及農民的分配消費，應由在政府的統制之下，爲一切活動的機構，第三，對各合作社的組織的目標，不但爲經濟的改造，而且須負有社會改造的責任，對内來剷除一切的封建勢力，對外是反抗國際的帝國主義。第四，這合作組織，自然是由上而下，而且應該帶幾分的强迫性了。</p>
<p>這本來不是我個人的觀察，去年中國合作學社的許多合作專家，在以合作方式繁榮農村的方案中，就有這樣重要的决議，現在趁舉行合作宣傳運動的機會，再來引伸一下。</p>

<h3>最近的歐洲合作運動彭師勤</h3>
<p>這次爲國際合作運動宣傳週撰文，編者以我正從歐洲考察合作事業回來，派了我這題目，因篇幅和時間的關係，這只能說一個大槪的大槪而已。</p>
<p>歐洲合作運動的趨勢，舉其大者，約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>（一）融合與統一歐洲合作社的創立，都由下而上，貧苦階級因事實的需要，糾合境遇相同的人，組織一個合作社。開辦之初，規模都是很小。比方消費合作社，僅是爲的免除零售商人丨雜貨店的剝削。這在合作運動萌芽時期之當日，還能與敵人相周旋。一到十九世紀之末年，情形已經大異。這種小規模的合作社，逐漸感到不容易生存。大戰以後，因商業組織的進步，更是岌岌可危。欲圖自救，不能不聨合起來，增加本身的勢力。於是合併的主張，瀰漫全歐。這時還只是同一區域内的各個目的相同的小合作社的融合，是一種防衛的陣線。近來各國主持合作中央組織的人，想把一國的同一性質的合作社，在一個上下一貫的系統下統一起來，以爲下面要談到的第二至第四幾項的先决條件，預備向敵人反攻，把陣容轉變過來。</p>
<p>融合的工作，直到今日還在進行之中。我們看近年的統計，無論消費合作社也好，生産合作社也好，信用合作也好，尤其是德國的農業信用合作社，其新設的社數雖較倒閉的社數爲多，然而總數常視先年爲略少。這正是融合的結果。至於統一較融合的工作更難實現。這不是專門受合作社的宗敎色彩或政治色彩的影響，而是一班創辦人固執之過。我們前面已經過合作社在開辦之初，模規甚小。但如辦理得法，而又有悠久的歷史，常能發達到一個相當的重要地位。這些有了相當重要地位的合作社，其創辦人每每頗以自矝，不願使自已和人家發生隷屬關係，加入批發合作社當一個社員，雖是可以，然而對於自已的獨立門面，却始終不願意犧牲。這種現象，在比利時還很容易撞見，不過目下漸漸地好起來了。</p>
<p>（二）生産合作與消費合作的聨絡丨消費合作社没有擴充到自已生産之前，一切消費品都須由外國購入：或是來自資本家的生産者，或是來自生産合作社。但是無論是來自前者，抑或來自後者，在價格上都免不了每消費社的利益發生衝突。資本家的生産者，姑且勿論；生産合作社對消費合作社的關係，季特敎授在他的某本書中，曾經說得很爲確切。生産合作社雖不是爲利潤，只在把中問人所蠶食的部份收歸已有，以爲這是牠的生産品被剝削的部份。可是消費合作社却以爲這是牠購入時被剝削的部份，也要求全部奪回。所以在這兩種合作社交易之時，各不相讓，以致無從接近。同時使資本家的生産者和中間人坐收漁人之利。邇來雙方都覺到這種現象，是合作運動前途的大障礙，如是消費合作社與生産合作社，尤其是消費合作社與農業合作社間，應該聨絡之說，甚囂塵上。各國的全國合作大會以及國際合作聨盟，都認這是當前一個重大問題。在合作共和國未出現而及賃銀制度未廢除以前，這種關係，是使經濟在滿足需要的條件下，全國地國際地組織起來。而且消費合作社與農業合作社聨絡的需要，更爲各國合作運動的推行者所特别注意。因爲農人直接所經營的農業合作社，在技術上和生産上常較城市的消費者所經營的農業合作社爲良。所以近年來消費合作社與農業合作社間存立諒解協約和交易合同之事，日有所聞。甚且消費者把已設立的農産生産組織歸併於農業合社，將以往的競爭和妒嫉之心，一筆消除。瑞士日内瓦的消費合作，將自已的牛乳營業抛棄，由日内瓦的牛乳合作社完全供給，即是一個顯明的例。</p>
<p>（三）批發合作之進展丨在現代資本主義的集中現象之下，小企業爲大企業所消滅，是當然的結果。工商業中尤爲顯明。小手工業者之所以還能殘存，是美術性的産品不能爲機器所代製。零售商之尙得維持，是賖賬制度一方面不通行於資本主義的大商店，一方面不爲合作原理所允許。合作社在現階段上，旣無力自已生産，直接供給批發合作社，應用批發合作，不惟是减輕入貨成本的唯一辦法，尤其是與一切私人商業得以相持不敗的重要條件。這個原則，雖久已爲合作者所努力趨赴，因爲種種原因，至今尙未照預定計劃完全實現。有的國家，還在簡單的批發所時代，没有堆棧的設備，僅由各處第二級合作社的代表，每週在批發所集會一次，收齊辦貨單據，轉囑供給人直接寄運各處。（未完）（本文徵稿接下星期一本報經濟專刊版）</p>

<p>前世界重體錦標</p>
<p>謝蓋忽打倒</p>
<p>意大利加奈拉驚人之作</p>
<p>（紐約二十九日電）世界重體擊拳界、本屬變化疊起、德人名家薛墨林旣逢阨於美人馬克巴埃、而意大利巨無霸加奈拉亦於十五回合中之第六回合、打倒前錦標美人謝蓋、此後重體錦標花冠、將加諸馬克巴埃與加奈拉二者之一矣、</p>
<p>▲巨彈爆發意人加奈拉重十八𠰴又八分半（每𠰴等於十四磅）謝蓋僅十四𠰴五、相差�</p>
<p>五十餘磅、賽時奇熱、結果之來、恍似巨彈爆發於四萬觀衆之　、令人驚駭不已、</p>
<p>▲倒地不起謝蓋連勝前五回合、勝利如在囊中、加奈拉出千鈞之力、撀諸敵身、再以可怖之短臂、向上直擊、謝蓋擺搖倒地、終致不起、是爲其一生第三次之失敗、</p>
<p>▲拳中敵頷第一回合、加奈拉起自塲角、神色飛揚、謝蓋躍入圍中、左拳連擊敵人、意人還手、力驅謝蓋至繩旁、謝蓋又左右中敵首、第一圍鈴聲將鳴之前、美人右手適中加奈拉之頷、</p>
<p>▲眩諸繩旁第二回合、意人謹愼從事、長臂揮出、謝蓋氣息爲之窒悶、但其返身一拳、中人顎部、重如千鈞、加夺拉眩諸繩旁、美人擬再繼續前取、不料本身突然受攻、氣窒不進、第二回合、從此告終、</p>
<p>▲被迫自衛第三回合、謝蓋意志鎭靜、聲東擊西、使敵人莫名其妙、頭上身部、一再受擊、加奈拉在壓迫之下、力求自衛、</p>
<p>▲犯規受警第四回合、巨無霸左臂仲出、突中謝蓋、立足不定、因處置得法、幸未受傷、意人斯時頗多失機、乃忽擅勾謝蓋左手、引之近身、同時迭擊其首、此項犯規行動、裁判員立予以警告、</p>
<p>▲搖擺歸位第五回合、謝蓋正　乘懈攻人、而意人又犯前轍、再受警告、美人力　加奈拉、鈴鳴之前、意人中拳、搖擺歸至塲角、</p>
<p>▲一擊成功第六回合、謝蓋先打敵面、繼中其身、加奈拉還攻、力驅錦標後退、忽然滑足、立見躍起、加奈拉左右並進、謝蓋受擊倒地、十數之呼聲已過、謝蓋終未起身、勝負遂分、是回終塲二分二十七秒、</p>

<h3>發射機啓蒙</h3>
<p>— 鑑村</p>
<p>▲：：：：：▲</p>
<p>二、發射機之要素</p>
<p>欲知發射機内部之構造，當先明構</p>

<p>電波　天綫　　接地　　電力放大器</p>
<p>拫　器　　調幅器　聲音放大器　音波</p>
<p>成發射機之一般要素。第一圖所示者爲其主要要素，茲特分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）傳話器：傳話器係將聲音，音樂等之音波變化爲電流之裝置，故傳話器所生之電流能依照音波壓力之變化而變。此種電流俗稱之曰聲音電流。</p>
<p>（二）聲音放大器：在傳話器所生之聲音電流極微弱，必須經過聲音放大器，放大至適當之强度而後送入調幅器。</p>
<p>（三）振盪器：振盪器係用以發生某一定週率之振盪電流，由此振盪電流之週率而决定天線所發射之電波波長。例如南京中央廣播電台之週率爲六百八十基羅週，改算其發射電波波長即爲四百四十米突。</p>
<p>（四）調幅器：調幅器之作用在將振盪電流與聲音電流合成而發生能由天線發射之射電週率電流。換言之，即將振盪電流變化爲聲音電流之波形是也。</p>
<p>（五）電力放大器：將調幅後之調幅電流在電力放大器放大至適當之强度而後由天線發射之。</p>
<p>（六）天線：最後將放大至適當强度後之調幅電流變爲電波而發射於空間。則天線之作用也。</p>
<h3>波長計算簡法</h3>

<h3>無綫電常識</h3>
<p>— 黄鑑村</p>
<p>（九）線圈</p>
<p>（一）線圈之性質：在無線電界，線圈（Ｃｏｉｌ）一語，本應稱爲自感量線圈，但爲簡便起見，略稱線圈。凡在適當的框架上捲繞導線者均可稱爲線圈。中有入鐵心者與無鐵心者，在圖籍上無鐵心之線圈，常以表之，有鐵心者以或表之。兩者均具有自感量（Ｉｎｄｕｃｔａｏｃｅ）以抵抗交流電。自感量愈大，則通過線圈之交流電流愈小，其阻力之强弱隨交流週率之大小而異，大抵週率愈大則阻力愈强。如是線圈對於交流電所特具之阻力稱曰廻阻，（Ｉｎｄｎｃｔｉｖｅ　Ｒｅａｃｔａｏｃｅ）此種關係，可由次式表之。設Ｌ爲線圈自感量　爲週率，　爲圓周率即Ｉ４ｒ６，則</p>
<p>阻＝２×　×週率×自感量＝　　ｆＬ</p>
<p>（二）單位：線圈内自感量之單位爲亨利（ＨｅｎＩｙ）略稱ｈ。然在</p>
<p>無線電上，亨利之値有時頗嫌過大，故常以Ｉｈ之千分之一爲單位，稱爲米厘亨利（Ｍｉｌｌｉｅｎｒｙ），略稱ｍ。或以其百萬分之一爲單位，稱爲買克羅亨利（Ｍｉｃｒｏ－ｈｅｎｒｙ）略稱ｕｂ。即：</p>
<p>Ｉ上ｈ＝Ｉｃｏｏｍｈ＝Ｉ，ｏｏｏ，ｃｏｏｕｈ</p>
<p>線圈之自感量隨其形狀，轉數，及鐵心之有無等而異其値，大抵線圈之形愈大，轉數愈多，則自感量愈大。</p>
<p>（三）線圈之種類：無線電界所使用之線圈，其種類頗多。茲舉其所常用者於次圖。圖中（一）爲蛛網式線圈，（二）爲圓筒形綫圈，（三）</p>
<p>爲蜂窠式綫圈，（四）爲籠狀綫圈，（五）爲俵疊式綫圈。</p>
<p>（四）線圈用之捲線：目下綫圈所使用之銅綫，多用十號至三十號之絲包或紗包線。所用銅綫，應以幾號綫爲最適合，頗難斷言。如使用銅綫直徑大者，則耗阻較少，而製成之綫圈每嫌過大，是以普通以二十二至三十號者爲最適用。</p>
<p>銅綫之大小以號數表之，表示銅綫之號數又分有兩種標準，一爲美國標準，略稱Ｂ·Ｓ·，一爲英國標準，略稱爲Ｂ·Ｗ·Ｇ。</p>
<p>書云。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>由頭痛說起</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>自從看到自由談　者的「多談風月，少發牢　」的啟事以來，我便頭痛到現在還没有停止。醫生告訴我頭痛是神經衰弱的表現，要防止頭痛，不要用思想，最好每天吃了飯便找朋友談天或者出去玩，倦了就睡覺，醒來餓了就吃東西，吃過了再去玩或者談天，總括一句話就是要過着「飽食終日，無所用心」的猪一般的生活。天！這樣我怎能辦得到呢？不但生活和工作不允許我不勞働，卽使身體暫時得到了兩天休息，可是要禁止我的腦筋在一小時内不思想，這是萬萬不可能的。</p>
<p>「除非砍掉我的腦袋，是没有方法制止我不思想的」有一天我很嚴重地向醫生抗議。</p>
<p>「試問你整天用腦有什麽好處呢？」他也很嚴重地質問我。</p>
<p>「誰管牠什麽好處不好處，總之，她要想，有什麽辦法呢？」</p>
<p>「好的，那麽你以後不要呌頭痛失眠，也不要常來看病了。」</p>
<p>就這樣，我現在有病連醫生的面前都不敢說了。</p>
<p>○○○○</p>
<p>我是比較愛說話愛發牢騒的，這也是大半由於環境的促成，可是現在我在遇着極沉默的生活，雖然朋友們常來信鼓勵我寫點東西，我自已也覺得長此下去，將來連一封信都不會寫的，很想借着有人督促的機會振作一下，可是寫什麽呢？國事不但不能參與，連談一談都不可能了，那麽還有什麽可寫呢？風花雪月，自殺愛情一類的文字旣不會寫，也不願寫，那麽，還有什麽可寫呢？</p>
<p>記得黎烈文先生剛剛接編自由談的時候，我曾很起劲地　了幾天東西，那時有人問我：」近來你寫的東西很不少！」我回答他：「那里那里，不遇因爲是自由談，所以我也樂得來自由談一下。」</p>
<p>可是現在呢？「自由談」上要加一個「不」字了，我們還能寫什麽呢？</p>
<p>某君來信說：「現在中國文人的厄運到了，如果　賣文爲生活時，只好坐以待斃。」我回信給他說：「如果他們不想法子打出一條生路的話，最好還是自已先掘好了墳墓，鑽進土裏去好些。」</p>
<p>從事文字勞働的朋友們啊，你們究竟預備怎樣？一九三三，六，十八於龍</p>
<h3>看了「大進攻」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>大槪第二次世界大戰快要開幕了吧，像溫課似的需要把一九一四年那一幕重看一遍。我們擠在外國丘八之間，看「大進攻」的演出；投在我的心影上的是巨人的毛掌，使我　慄，使我皇然於那不可知的命運！</p>
<p>停戰消息傳出時，戰場上士兵的狂歡那一幕使我感動極了。但是從戰塲回來以後的情形怎樣呢？他們如羅馬的自由農民的運命一樣，『爲國家盡了義務，毫無怨心的爲他的國家出去打仗；過了十年，十五年，二十年之後，他回家來了，他的地上長滿了野草，他的家也毁了。雖然如此，他郤是情願重新起首經營。他耕了地，下了種，指望他成熟，他帶了他的榖子與他的牛羊雞鴨等到市上去，但是那裏有許多用奴隸耕種田地的大地主，有意將一切物品竭力的貶價，因此他大受損失。兩年的工夫他還可以維持他自已的生活。到了後來可是絶望了，祇好抛棄了他的地土。他離開了鄉村，到最近的城裏來。他在城裏也是挨餓，與以前在田地上一樣。但是没有法子，祇好與幾千别的没有田産的窮人受同樣的困苦。他們都蹲在城外的破房子裏，因此很容易得到傳染病死的。他們爲了國家出去打仗，回來反得到這樣的報酬。』（房龍人類的故事）</p>
<p>所以尖銳的集合號聲，使千千萬萬候補的寡婦孤兒擁在車站；衝鋒號聲使千千萬萬年富力强的壯士折足斷臂的横倒在戰壕上：四十二生的大砲過處，高樓化爲灰燼：飛機在巴黎城上盤旋，嚇得街上男男女女作鳥獸竄；戰地醫院來不及醫治傷兵，就讓他輾轉呼號而死；這一幕幕者是驚心動魄的慘影；但想起在城裏挨餓而死，則這些生命斷於俄傾的倒比較幸福得多。</p>
<p>聞停戰而連忙剃鬍子的朋友，想起在華盛頓聽威爾遜爲和平而戰的演說，而慷慨捨身從軍，當不禁自已失笑。但等到加入饑餓線步入華盛頓請願時，想起聞停戰而連忙剃鬍子，當又不禁失笑。</p>
<p>然而人類總是健忘的，折臂斷足的先後已經死去人，又有人蔣準備爲一篇演說而效命沙場子。「大進攻」的上演，正暗示着這嚴重的時代性！</p>
<h3>隔壁人家</h3>
<p>— 彭家煌</p>
<p>當我那晚十一時敲着後門的時候，看見隔壁亭子間裏的朋友也在敲門。他是敲得那樣有節奏，且溫和的呌着：「××的媽，請你開開門啊！」頭仰望着黑漆冷淸的亭子間。自然我也是如此。</p>
<p>我們始在窗下徘徊，雖不曾談話，我們的心事，却彼此都心照不宜。</p>
<p>没有聽到扶梯響，却有人下樓。我的後門忽然碰的一下開了，像是設着空城計一樣。夜半更深，有何話說呢？準備全軍覆没就是，我抱着犧牲的精神，惘然的走進去。惴惴的縮伏在熟睡的孩子身邊，肝腸寸斷的想着這一日奔波的失敗，尤其是懸懸於自已將不知怎樣被惡言毒語把靈魂寸磔着的危懼，我不由得不聚精會神忘記了自已，忘記切近自已的一切，去聽聽隔壁亭子間的動靜。我相信，那是處治我的絶妙方法。</p>
<p>隔壁亭子間不斷的傳出女人的聲音；</p>
<p>「野東西，你是到外頭去借銅鈿啊，你這野猪精！借銅鈿要到這辰光纔能回家啊！</p>
<p>「喂，我問你，我問你，你借銅鈿，借銅鈿，銅鈿在那裏？趕快給我拿出來，死人！</p>
<p>「噢，你整天整大在外頭白相，你讓我們娘娘崽崽在家裏吃粥湯，你是人！你是人！猪　胚，爛汚胚。有本事死到外頭去好咧，一輩子不要回來好咧！</p>
<p>「這種男人，哼，我纔看見過，本事末嘸没，銅鈿末，賺勿來！還假痴假呆說有地方借，有地方借，借到半夜，你借到幾何啦？</p>
<p>「死人，你拿來，你不拿來嗎？好，好，我要看看你的本事，這日脚我不要過了：：：」</p>
<p>當我正聽得入神的時候，忽然我的頭髮被人拉住了：</p>
<p>「鬼，鬼，你不響就算了啊，你不響就算了啊！哼，當我是好吃果子，丨丨好，明天，小交給你：：：」</p>
<p>「對不住，對不住，我聽到隔壁亭子間裏去了，對不住。」</p>
<p>我還是不能不聽隔壁亭子間的吵鬧聲，因爲這是處治我的絶妙方法，我想到隔壁亭子間裏的朋友一定和我一樣，因爲我始終就没有聽到他一點聲音。</p>
<h3>敬答何如先生</h3>
<p>— 羅復</p>
<p>復的「進一新解」是因爲职避免意見相左的嫌疑，不曾矜爲獨得也不頣嫌爲腐談。如果何如先生要從這點刻舟求劍，我承認我的用語笨拙好了。便說是「三字經」，如果彼此之間没有尊嚴，是不必有不平的。像今天我的答復，也是「三字經」，因爲都是「人所盡知」的話。但不是「氣聊之文，也不是玩物喪志」，至少，能爲「蠡測歷史來源之助」，便不會「謬佔篇幅」，虚耗光陰」，這是我要「鄭重申首」的。</p>
<p>京劇脚色有文武之分，像生和武生，小生和武小生，旦和武旦，丑和武丑，還有一種文武崑　不攩的脚色。但在崑劇　只有些小生或生戎裝，武裝上的寫法，並没有武生的名辭。武旦，也一樣無此名辭，像義俠記的武松用小生扮，顧大嫂用旦扮。一丈靑用小旦扮，是一個好的例證。至於武丑，是百年以來　有的，崑劇裏連道一類脚色，都没有先例可舉。</p>
<p>因爲崑劇没有武劇。像三國志，水滸等劇，到相打的時候，不過廳景龍了，並不大打特打。至於上　下手，筋斗虎跳，崑劇更不會有。所以，不必特設武脚，</p>
<p>武劇的有無是影響到劇的音樂的。像京劇的音樂科；俗名塲面，塲面分文塲武場，大鋼大鼓的場面是武場，拉胡琴，彈月琴，吹笛，吹笙都是文場，崑劇的主要音樂是管笛，以前的弋陽腔，　監腔，主要的音樂是　索，到後來樅陽腔，　陽腔，秦腔主要的音樂也是一樣。只有高　不用絲竹合腔，僅用鑭鼓，除這　例之外，歌舞的塲面，除絃變器，管樂器，　樂器主要的也只是鼓板，是東戲的文場。大　大鼓的場面是爲起打助力的，在武劇闌人之後，纔有牠的路綫可以尋找。</p>
<p>前淸皇帝冬至郊天回宫，有由梨園上下手翻一單提，各當福壽錠一兩的一種儀武。這可見筋斗虎跳的武工把子本是一穏賣解，武場的音樂是替賣解壯壯聲威，是賣解的場面，　後來，賣解和舊劇交融，這場面，也和文場場面交融了。</p>
<p>據顧說，撮墊圈：：之類的解數在明代是閒雜在文場戲劇之間的，卽是，没有融人戲劇裏面。却在甲劇完場，乙劇没有不演的時候來這一場熱鬧，這熱鬧的音樂當然是大　大鼓但無論甲劇，乙劇，却都只是文場，我不曾放過的只在這裏。</p>
<p>但何如先生說「撮墊圈：：不能　北曲但有武把子而無鑺鼓也」。這是因爲不曾「細看下文，」所以「不禁失望」。我是始終不曾說過「北曲有武把子」的；我只是說，武把子不曾正式闌人北曲，因此大鑺大鼓的武場也不曾正式闌人北曲，最初的南曲，自也不能例外。因此，關於這點，我也「未便承認，敬以璧還」。</p>
<p>不過，我却斗膽敬領何如先生「璧還」我的厚禮了。因爲我是主張「鑺鼓是和武把子同時侵人舊戲」的，但我却不承認「自有戲劇一物卽不離鑺鼓」的「三字經」，因爲，野響人的舞蹈我不會說是戲劇，至少，話劇不用鑺鼓，誰也應當承認。</p>
<p>關於「大面」，却因爲限於字數，不多說了；我希望何如先生再能繼續找到「大面歌舞所伴奏的樂器」，快脫出「意者」的範圍。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Jules　Renard作林取譯</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚的照片册（續）</p>
<p>十四</p>
<p>「撒嬌！這話是什麽意思？」紅蘿蔔鬚問那被母親溺愛着的小皮耶。</p>
<p>大槪懂得是怎麽一回事之後，他便呌說：</p>
<p>「我呢，我所希望的是再用指頭叮着盆子裏的炸番薯的殘屑，和吮吸那有着核的一半桃子。」</p>
<p>他思索了一下：</p>
<p>「如果雷辟克太太給我以熱烈的愛撫時，她一定會從算子開始的。」</p>
<p>十五</p>
<p>有時　姐姐愛勒絲丁和大哥菲利克斯玩得疲倦了，便自願把他們的玩具借給紅蘿蔔鬚。他分取他們每個人的一部分幸福，很謙　地組成了他自已的幸福。</p>
<p>因爲害怕他們問他要還的緣故，他决不敢遇於現出高興的樣子。</p>
<p>十六</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨那麽，你不覺得我的兩耳太長嗎？</p>
<p>瑪狄爾德丨我覺你的兩耳長得很怪：你肯把它們借給我嗎？我想把一些沙子裝在裏面做點心玩。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨如果媽媽先把它們燒燃了的話，沙子便會在那裏面炙熟起來。</p>
<p>十七</p>
<p>「你還不停住嗎？讓我再聽一遍看！那麽你在我和你父親兩人裏面，比較喜歡你的父親嗎」？雷辟克家的到處說。</p>
<p>「我站着不動，我什麽都不說，我可以對你發誓，你們兩個人我都不喜歡。」紅蘿蔔鬚心裏這樣回答。</p>
<p>十八</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨你在做什麽，紅蘿蔔鬚？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨我不曉得，媽媽。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨這卽是說你又在做着什麽無意識的事情啦。你是有意做的嗎？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨我所差的就是這一點。</p>
<p>十九</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚以爲他的母親對他微笑着，很高興，就也跟着微笑。</p>
<p>可是模糢糊祇在自個兒微笑着的雷辟克家的，突然把面孔一板，就像黑木做的頭顱上面嵌着兩顆黑色覆盆子似的眼睛。</p>
<p>手足失措的紅纙蔔鬚便不知要往那裏逃走了。</p>

<h3>人類的厄運</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>「科學」對於將來人類的生活，究竟是「有益一呢，還是「有害」。這是一個謎，劉伯温再世，諸葛亮重生，也不易「非卜先知」。</p>
<p>「電話」，是少不了用接線生的。但是電話局改裝了「自動電話」之後，大批接線生的「飯碗」，已成了一大堆「碎碗片」了。</p>
<p>從前，淸晨，傍晚，我們常可以見到各工塲的男工，女工，坐了「獨輪小車」，來來往往。自從有了「稱快價廉，大衆可坐」的電車之後，「獨輪小車」便由運「人」，一變而以運「物」爲主了，但現在大一些的公司行號，都自備了「運貨卡車」，於是乎「獨輪小車夫」的生活，已漸臨「日薄崦嵫」的程度。</p>
<p>「洋布」，旣細緻光潔，而價又低廉，於是中國農村中自種棉，自織布的農民，惟有背了布上城，背了布回府，而對着米缸發愁。用科學方法的染織發明之後，中國的綢緞業，一落千丈，綢緞工人，生活大起恐慌。</p>
<p>印度國父甘地先生提倡「土布」，詛咒「科學」，似乎是對時代開倒車，但是我們若是丢了「酒」與「肉」的享樂，而墊高了枕頭想一想，將來若有「科學的産品」來奪取了你恃以賺取麵包的工作，那你的「生活」，便將如何，那你雖具備了一個「科學的頭腦」，便不怕你不對「科學」懷疑。</p>
<p>這並不是說笑話，依現在的「科學進步率」看來，任何繁複的事務，都可用没有「神經」的東西來工作。例如在馬路口管理「車輛交通」的巡捕，據報載，可用定製的「傀儡」來替代。</p>
<p>「機器人」已可駕駛了飛機，從洛杉磯安然飛到紐約。照這樣子的演進，人類還有「生路」麽？　　雖然我們現在叨了「科學」不少光，但是人類的「厄運」，怕就要來臨了吧！</p>
<h3>夏夜的公園</h3>
<p>— 黄克威</p>
<p>温柔的晚風帶走了這南國的初夏的炎熱，籠着金黄色的殘陽的公園，是充滿着甜蜜的氣息。</p>
<p>樹木伸長着胳膊，撑着一頂靑紗傘似的　立着，烏兒鼓動了玲瓏的巧舌，啁啁啾啾地呌着，跳着，紅的，黑的，黄的：：：野花，露出鮮妍的嬌　偷偷地瞧着長旗袍裏的赤裸的大腿。</p>
<p>有熱情的巴黎女郎，紅襖子，白短裙，金絲髮，跟着大袖子飄蕩。有東洋的嬌娃，三四個高的髮髻，白的脖子花衣服上襯着一個燦爛的包袱，木履撲托撲托地地交響着。有印度少婦，披着長幾及地的兜紗，寛大的服裝裏顫動着大個子的乳峯，耳圈，戒子，手鐲，閃着金色的光，亡國的高貴爵位的遺族丨</p>
<p>年靑人挾着時代姑娘的白嫰的圓臂，長褲管輕輕地移過綠茵風捲着愛人的肉香和粉香，吻着年靑人的臉兒，鵝毛絨似的踏的細碎的脚步，沿着草徑兜個圈子，或者坐在綠蔭下談笑着，愉快地，没有煩悶，没有痛苦！</p>
<p>飲冰棚臨時裝璜得摩登化，像妓女們到了夜間，粉飾着黄面出去賣肉一樣：侍者穿起簇新的制服，笑眯眯地恭候着主顧。</p>
<p>音樂亭裏射着白熱的燈光，大銅鼓提着發沙的嗓子，粗暴地，和着其他的樂聲，交奏一支消夏之曲。</p>
<p>月亮剛從東方升起來，淡淡地，夜色迷漫着整個的園子，一切的輪廓糢糊了，只有嬌滴滴的笑聲，還蕩漾在月光稀疏的綠蔭裏。</p>
<h3>麗娃栗妲邨紀遊有懷</h3>

<p>穿林一徑恰當門，花草蕭疏意自溫。豈必招凉有覺，雪天月地倍銷塊。</p>

<p>黄金勝地雨相須，涉足能令（萊平！）</p>
<p>意緒殊。來往心頭貧富感，不平物候未焚書。</p>
<p>亦有柔波帶綠陰，夕陽如橘書初沈。却尋玄武湖邊味，盪盡離人日夜心。</p>
<p>風蟬底事挾愁過，小小年華淺淺波。似我情專元是誤，人間可語本無多。</p>

<h3>機器人素描</h3>
<p>— 虎頭</p>
<p>我剛寫了這個題目，旁邊有位朋友笑着，說道；「機器人有什麽描討人厭，伊總到新世界下車，像是三公司的職員。還有一個是法國的密司脫，他一上車，便東張西望，先看同車的人，好像防止扒手似的，張望了回，便一屁股坐了下來·到八仙橋纔下車。我看他不是電車公司職員，便是巡捕房裏的人物，因爲他老是不買票坐頭等的。勞神父路車站本來有一大堆不同的人上來，可是近來極少，有時甚至於没有人。原因是爲勞神父路西叚刻正翻造房屋，這些機器人，或許已喬遷了罷丨沿着再往北，便是辣斐德路。此地路口成裕里，有個摩登密司，年紀大約不過十七八，上車時總同着一個三十左右的密司脫，看不淸是黑漆板凳，還是什麽？聽他倆談話，女的在南洋高商念書，男的到大世界北首，便獨自溜了。近來辣斐德路站上，又添了一個靑布旗袍的密司，小小的眼睛，面顂上的笑渦，時常映着，尤其是嘻開嘴笑的時候太平橋站上有一個三十來歲的女人，和一個瘦得可憐的男子。這個女的是梳着况可鑑人的髮髻，手裏挾着一個紙包，像學生的課卷，規規矩矩的上車，毫無嘻皮笑臉之狀，一望而知是什麽地方的敎員。還有一位瘦得可憐的男子，好像我的同學，不過我至今還不能肯定，所以從來没有與他招呼；他有時穿西裝，有時穿長袍。看他的臉上，似乎肺病很重，不是第三期，總是第二期，可是他還类幹着機器人的生活。自此而茄勒路，而南陽橋寫？而你偏偏要挖空心思來賺幾個錢稿費，這眞大可不必，大可不必！」我道：「且慢丨且慢！我之所謂機器人，並非木製的，也非機器製的，不過出作入息，有一定的時候，好像一部機器，開走了發條，總是照着走動，還是皮包着血肉和骨一樣的人。所以「機器人素描」者，各色人之素描也。丨題解。</p>
<p>我們這般人，天天過着呆版的生活，非常枯燥。可是有一件也很耐人尋味的，便是准時出入，定有許多人不約而同的會給你相見。雖然盡是相逢陌路人，只因天天相見，似乎也變了熟人。於是我便有把各位不相識的他和伊描寫一下的必要。</p>
<p>我住在南市斜橋，做事的地方在梅白格路。十八路無軌電車，是我「不可一日無此君」的好友。一路上與我同道的：有密司，也有密司脫。我在早上八點半光景坐車，到康悌路同時有兩三個人上來，一個是穿着時色旗袍，不十分高的高跟鞋的密司，面部薄施脂粉，不，褚家橋，寗波路，八仙橋，大世界：雖然都有人上下，可是都無一定，算不得機器人，大約這一帶是肉感陳列所，楊梅出産地，所以機器人不配住進去罷</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>第十回</p>
<p>聞語驚芳心封侯願渺</p>
<p>聽歌現羨色報國身閑</p>
<p>牛先生，你說我嫁了這樣一個軍人，還是他生前我享着福呢？還是他死後我享着福呢？他丢下兩個男孩子，一個女孩子，倒要我把他們喂養大來。這幾年，自已和孩子們的穿衣吃飯，那還不算，還要供給孩子們念書，我這樣嫁丈夫爲着什麽？簡直是前輩子欠了債，現在還債來了。桂枝聽他說了這番話，不由得心中倒抽了一口冷氣，原來嫁軍人的下塲是這樣的，坐在坑上，兩手按了坑席望着劉家媽的臉，人倒呆住了。牛先生也是兩手按了雙膝蓋，看着劉家媽的臉，連連搖晃了幾下道；忽見　頭楊柳色，悔敎夫壻覔封侯。有道是醉臥沙場君莫笑，古來征戰幾人回？桂枝和劉家媽，都不懂他說什麽，並没有去理會他。牛先生是人家向他發𪳯，自已未免有些不能下場，就向劉家媽道；大嫂子，你找我來，有什麽說嗎？劉家媽喲了一聲，笑道，你瞧，我只管說話，把正經事倒躭誤了。他說到這裏，却又歎了一口氣；不瞞你說，這孩子的爸爸，雖是和我會少離多，可是我們恩情很好的。明兒個是他的陰壽，我總記得，我想起他的好處來了，我就要燒兩個紙包給他。請你没有别的，寫兩個紙包袱皮。桂枝越聽這些話，越是覺得毛骨悚然·這些話，無非是越聽越難受，實在不願向下聽了，因道：劉家媽，你有事，我不願坐了，請你把那丸藥給我罷。劉家媽因爲人家母親有病，也就不敢久留人家，只得給了他丸藥，讓他回去。桂枝走回家來，臉色是異常的不好看，不聲不響的，將帶來的一小包丸藥，放在桌上，看到坑上，有母親未曾做完的衣服，拿起針線衣料來，就坐下開始縫聨着。（一一六）</p>

<h3>The Issue of Incorporating Puppet Troops to be Discussed in Dalian</h3>
<p>Lei Shourong and Others Go to Dalian to Meet Li Jichun</p>
<p>Receiving War Zone Committee Scheduled to be Established Today</p>
<h3>Receiving Procedures Start with Opening Traffic</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The committee members of the War Zone Receiving Committee staying in Beiping have successively departed for Tianjin yesterday to prepare everything. Tao Shangming is scheduled to rush there tonight. Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, and Xue Zhiheng plan to take a boat to Dalian tonight to meet with Li Jichun to discuss methods for incorporating puppet troops. Regarding the procedures for receiving the war zone, it has been decided to start with opening traffic on the Beining Railway, and first to open the line to Tangshan. However, since Li Jichun's headquarters are still in Tangshan, negotiations should be made with the Japanese to order them to move east. Before our police enter Tangshan, it is proposed to ask the Japanese military police to protect the Tianjin-Tangshan traffic. In the future, the Japanese side will not send additional representatives or have any committee organizations for receiving the war zone. All military matters will be the responsibility of the Tianjin North China Garrison Headquarters, and political matters will be the responsibility of the Japanese Embassy. Regarding the incorporation of Li Jichun's troops, there have been considerable negotiations between China and Japan. The unresolved issue is still the number of personnel. In the future, it is planned to transfer them to the Jixian area for reorganization and to reorganize them into security teams. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The issue of dealing with puppet troops is quite difficult because there are no provisions in the armistice agreement. The Japanese outwardly show they don't care, but secretly assist them. We have no choice but to negotiate by sending Lei Shourong, Xue Zhiheng, and Yin Tong to Dalian on the 30th night to negotiate with Japanese and puppet representatives to resolve the matter. The War Zone Receiving Committee is scheduled to be established in the provincial government on the 1st at noon. According to Yu Xuezhong, the establishment ceremony will not be held because all the committee members cannot be present. The receiving procedures are only intended as a preparation, and future arrangements will depend on the situation. Martial law in this city is scheduled to be lifted on the 1st. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Jichun has arrived in Dalian. After our representative Xue Zhiheng and others arrive, the Japanese Kwantung Army will introduce them to Li for a private meeting regarding the incorporation of puppet troops, without holding a conference or making any decisions. They will only bring back the results of the discussion, and then submit them for final confirmation when China and Japan meet in Tanggu to discuss the overall issue of receiving the war zone. However, this issue is complex and progress will inevitably be delayed. The Japanese Kwantung Army representative Kita has arrived in Tianjin. Regarding the opening of the Beining Railway, Qian Zongze and others will first contact Kita. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tongzhou reports that there are no traces of Japanese troops within the territory of Sanhe County. The Japanese troops in Fengrun County withdrew east on June 18, and the Japanese troops in Yutian withdrew completely on June 26. A small number of Japanese troops are still stationed in the Shangcangzhen and Xiacangzhen areas of Jixian County. Before the appointed magistrate of Sanhe arrives, Li Jichun sent a certain Lin to the county to instigate merchants and elect a magistrate. After Magistrate Cai took office, he disappeared. The election of the magistrate has become a thing of the past. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lutai reports that around 10 p.m. last night, six or seven puppet soldiers were spotted in the Dawan Village area, using flashlights to probe our positions. After our sentries fired, they returned fire a few times and then retreated. Puppet troops are still stationed in Ninghe City. The Japanese and puppet troops in that area show no sign of withdrawing. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Jinzhou reports that in recent days, Japanese troops have been withdrawing from inside the pass. Trains passing through Jindo are constantly arriving. Units temporarily assigned to combat are also successively returning to the mainland. Part of the Hiraga Brigade has arrived in Qiqihar, and the main force of the Hattori Brigade has moved to Shenyang. The 6th Division of the Itamoto will be stationed separately on the Feng-Yu, Shen-Hai, South Manchuria, and Ji-Dun lines. The headquarters are currently located in Jinzhou. The 8th Division of Nishi Yoshikazu will be stationed in Rehe. The newly formed Wang Tiexiang and Liu Peichen puppet bandit armies have departed from outside the pass and are heading to the Tangshan area. Liu is still recruiting bandits in various places outside the pass and will successively send them into the pass to assist the puppet troops of Li Jichun and Zhao Lei in carrying out disturbances. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shunyi reports that on the 29th, the 14 villages in the 6th district of the county that are adjacent to the two counties of Huairou and Miyun received a letter from the Japanese military headquarters stating that all combat zones should be designated as independent zones. In Changping County, the 4th sub-bureau of Chawu Village forced the village chiefs of these 14 villages to hold a meeting. A resolution was passed yesterday, but the implementation date has not yet been determined. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Receiving Committee was established in Tianjin on the 1st. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Qingdao Naval Incident is Under Investigation</h3>
<p>The Question of Shen Honglie's Stay or Departure</p>
<p>The Pingzheng Political Council Has Not Yet Expressed Any Opinion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan said that the Northeast Fleet Incident was investigated. The Northeast Navy has never obeyed the central government, and all actions are free. I don't know the details of this incident. As for the three ships Haiqi, etc., leaving Qingdao to sail elsewhere, the reasons are also unclear. The report said that they had arrived in Weihai, but I have not heard of it. The interim meeting of the Executive Yuan did not discuss this matter. The central government has appropriate measures. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) After Feng Zhichong failed to assassinate Shen, five or six classmates of the Northeast Navy serving on the three ships Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhahe participated in the conspiracy. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the senior officers of the three ships leading most of the marines ashore to be inspected on that day, they coerced a small number of soldiers to launch an attack simultaneously, making various demands and issuing a telegram stating that they would sail the ships to the Yangtze River, and then said they would sail to Shidao and Rongcheng Bay. After the headquarters sent planes to investigate, it was known that they were definitely not in Shidao or other places. Every day, there are telegrams from the North China coast, such as Weihai, Changshan Island, and other places, but there is no sign of the ships. According to Qingdao Radio Station eavesdropping, the Haiqi tried to communicate with the Zhenru Radio Station two days ago but failed. In the past two days, it has not communicated with any place, so its whereabouts are still unknown. The five or six officers involved in this mutiny were all cultivated by Shen himself and have followed him for more than ten years. Since Shen concurrently served as mayor, they have repeatedly sought to fill important positions in the municipal government. Shen wanted to separate the military and government to avoid confusion, so he did not grant their requests. Therefore, they were disappointed. Also, these members usually behaved improperly and have been repeatedly supervised and admonished by Shen. Or they resented him and took this desperate action. Whether there are other backgrounds is still unknown. After the Haiqi and other ships left port, Shen repeatedly telegraphed back and forth, saying that for the sake of the overall national situation, he was willing to sacrifice himself, and telegraphed Chairman Jiang and Executive President Wang, taking the blame and resigning from his concurrent positions. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to those familiar with the inside story, the truth of the Qingdao naval incident is that the initiators were lower-level team leaders, who seem to have a secret organization of ten people, led by a certain Guan. They were very dissatisfied because their promotion was too slow and Shen's military discipline was strict. They actively moved in secret, so they sent Feng Zhizhong to assassinate Shen, and sailed the three ships Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe to Lishi Island, then disarmed the sailors. They then issued a statement in the name of ten people attacking Shen. Shen did not want the situation to escalate, so he sent Deputy Chief of Staff Shi and two others to mediate. Shen stated two points: 1. The three ships that left Lishi Island must not surrender to the puppet regime. 2. They must not go to the coast and cause trouble. Shen's personal position is not a problem. However, after Shi left, there is still no concrete solution. The Military Branch has sent personnel to Qingdao to investigate the truth, and it can be resolved within a few days. The three ships are still on Changshan Island, and the captains of the ships are still in Qingdao and did not participate. (30th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Qingdao naval issue has become a stalemate. The warships are acting freely, Shen has resigned, and some soldiers are preparing to support Xie Gangzhi to succeed him as commander. The actions of Xie Xiangren should be noted. The criminal Feng Zhichong is still in custody. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) There is news that the three Qingdao ships are going to Changshan Island. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Qingdao naval issue has occurred and the inside story is quite complicated. Shen Honglie recently telegraphed his office in Beiping, saying that the Zhahe, Haiqi, and Haichen ships were in Rongcheng Bay on the morning of the 29th, but their whereabouts were unknown in the afternoon, and they lost contact with the Qingdao Radio Station. It is heard that Shen is now expressing that if the three ships can consider the severity of the national crisis and return to the fleet, safety will be guaranteed. As for the request of the ships that Shen should resign, Shen will not hesitate to do so. The Beiping authorities mainly sent personnel to Rongcheng Bay to investigate the whereabouts of the ships and persuade them, hoping to prevent the situation from escalating. There has been no expression on Shen's stay or departure. (30th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Chahar Incident</p>
<h3>Central Government Continues to Propose Two Measures, Feng Yuxiang is Still Considering</h3>
<p>Please Feng to Cancel the Name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army</p>
<p>Try to Lead the Guards to Beiping for Close Consultation</p>
<p>Feng's Representative Li Xin Returns to Zhangjiakou to Report</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Zhang Jiyong returned to Beiping from Zhangjiakou for the second time and proposed Feng's four solutions, because they were far from the central government's proposed measures, Song, because it was not easy to transfer Chu, personally wrote a letter to Feng, which stated that after Zhang and others returned to Beiping, they learned that Mr. Feng's opinions on Chahar were slightly different, and Zheyuan's situation was difficult, and it was temporarily difficult to return to Chahar, and his back pain recurred, and he planned to go to Tianjin for treatment. The future of Chahar is full of difficulties and hope that Mr. will handle it well. After receiving the letter, Feng knew that the Chahar incident had become a stalemate, which was very unfavorable, so he sent Li Xin to Beiping to visit Song, hoping for a peaceful solution, and hoped that Song would return to Chahar to handle everything. Then he sent Deng Zhexi to Beiping again, and still asked Song to do his best to mediate. Song then continued to mediate. Recently, the central government and the Beiping authorities have formulated two more solutions to the Chahar incident: 1. Please Feng to cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and Song will return to Chahar to handle it properly; 2. Please Feng to lead the guards to Beiping as much as possible to consult with the Beiping Municipal Military and Political Authorities on all strategies for saving the country. The above two measures have been handed over to Li Xin and carried to Zhangjiakou yesterday to meet with Feng for consultation. It is estimated that after Li Xin arrived in Zhangjiakou last night, he will consult with Feng once today, and there may be a reply telegram to Beiping tonight to find a way to solve the Chahar incident. Deng Zhexi is still in Beiping this morning, continuing to contact various parties. After Li Xin's reply telegram arrives in Beiping, he will go to Zhangjiakou today or tomorrow to convey the intentions of the Beiping authorities to Feng. The Chahar incident will be resolved, and there may be a concrete announcement today or tomorrow. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The key to the Chahar situation is still that Feng refuses to cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, and Feng's residence issue cannot be resolved. Song will stay in Beiping for the time being. A certain important person has conveyed this intention to Feng. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangjiakou said that the troops of Feng in Zhangjiakou, from Ningyuan to Zhangjiakou, dug up battlefields along the line, and set up a machine gun every half mile, with very strict defenses. Feng made every effort to maintain the security of Zhangjiakou and the order of the Ping Sui Railway. Guang Zhi, the former head of the Ping Sui Railway Police Section in Zhangjiakou, was dismissed by Feng's troops, and now he has been restored to his original position. Between Nankou and Changping, there were heavy rains on the 28th and 29th, and mountain floods broke out. The floodwaters have submerged the tracks, and the trains did not dare to risk moving forward, so there were many delays. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the central government had previously sent a telegram to Beiping, advocating three points for the Chahar incident: (1) Since Feng has the determination to resist Japan, the military affairs north of the Yellow River can be completely entrusted to him, but he must obey the orders of the central government; (2) Persuade Feng to cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army; (3) If the first two items cannot be realized, the previous proposal to send troops into Chahar will still be implemented. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Xin sent a telegram to Beiping this morning, saying that the two measures proposed here have been conveyed to Feng, and he is currently considering them. It is heard that because Fang Ji expressed that he is still determined, these two measures still need to be considered, so the solution to the Chahar situation still requires several days of running around. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Beiping authorities received Li Xin's telegram, they convened a meeting of generals and decided to proceed according to the second measure and continue to mediate. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Qing went to Zhangjiakou today to visit Feng. According to reports, this trip to Zhangjiakou was to inspect the volunteer army under his command and meet with Feng, because the volunteer army under his command in Rehe had been handed over to Chen Lianfu for command, and had opened to Zhangjiakou via Nankou. Yu personally went to the area to comfort them, and there were no other tasks. The date of stay in Zhangjiakou is undecided. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Unrest in Jilin</h3>
<p>Reports of Banditry Occur Several Times a Day</p>
<p>(Dalian) On the 21st of this month, four Japanese and one Russian who were supervisors on the new road between Laha and Harbin were killed in Xiaochangzi (transliteration) in Jilin Province. Also, Xinbin County in the southeast of Shenyang was occupied by "bandits" who extorted house rent from the people, ranging from three to four yuan per household, totaling about 3,000 yuan. The bandits in the area claim to have 4,000 people, but in reality, there are only 800. In addition, reports of banditry are received several times a day from all sides. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang Zhenwu's Vanguard Heads Towards Dolun</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Yu Ya-nong and Wang Zhongxue, two units of Fang Zhenwu, arrived in Kangbao, they continued to advance. Yu's troops were in Guyuan on the 28th night, and the vanguard continued to advance towards Dolun. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, a representative of Fang Zhenwu here claimed that Fang's troops had recovered Dolun on June 23. Currently, Fang's troops are advancing towards Guyuan. This news has not yet been verified, but assuming that the rumor of Liu Guitang's defection is true, Dolun is likely in the hands of the Chinese army. It may be possible, Liu Guitang's troops stationed in Dolun defected to the Chinese army. It was not recovered by Fang's troops. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Decide to Enter Qinghai in Two Routes</h3>
<p>Liu Huanzhang and Others Leave Beijing for the North</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the order for Sun Dianying to be the Director of Reclamation in the Western District of Qinghai was issued, Sun was eager to avoid the chaotic situation in Chahar, so he ordered his subordinates to prepare to leave and telegraphed the military and political authorities to request instructions for future arrangements. The authorities have handed over the instructions to Liu Huanzhang and Liu Binghan of the army's office in Beijing, who will personally convey them. The two Lius took the Pingpu train to Beiping on the 30th. According to Liu, Sun could not bear to see the national lifeline lost in internal strife, so he was eager to leave Chahar and devote himself to practical work. As for the route to Qinghai, it was decided to divide it into two routes: one from Jincheng through Tongguan to Qinghai, and the other from Shacheng through Baotou to Qinghai. However, with tens of thousands of troops, a long journey of thousands of miles, and passing through several provinces, marching is difficult, and full preparation must be made in advance. Fortunately, the areas through which the army passes have been notified by the Executive Yuan to provide convenience. Therefore, after I arrive in Shacheng to meet with Commander Sun and present the authorities' instructions, the entire army can set off. It is rumored that Chairman Ma is opposed to our army entering Qinghai, but after President Wang telegraphed to inquire, there was no such thing. And Chairman Ma has telegraphed President Wang and Commander Sun, expressing his agreement. In fact, the entry of our army into Qinghai will definitely not harm the local area, because the expenses of our army are borne by the central government and the Beiping Military Branch, and there is no need to take from the local area. We are determined to create a paradise from the desolate land and find sweet springs from hardship. (30th dispatch)</p>

He arrived in Beijing from Shanghai again on the morning of the 30th. (30th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dark Clouds Over the Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Moray Expresses Refusal to Discuss Currency Stabilization</p>
<p>Monetary Issues Struggle Against American and French Opposition</p>
<p>European Gold Countries Hope to Conclude a Temporary Agreement</p>
<p>Curbing the Violent Fluctuations of Currency</p>
<p>(London) The issue of currency stability remains the key element of the future success of the ongoing World Economic Conference. The decision of this issue will make the end of this week full of possibilities. Today, the United Kingdom, on the one hand, is unwilling to join the Continental European faction and make things difficult for the United States, and on the other hand, it is eager to seek European stability, so British Prime Minister MacDonald is now on a monetary seesaw, with the United States advocating inflation at one end and France advocating currency stability at the other. The United States wants to continue its booming business, while the European gold countries want to maintain their gold standard. With different goals, it seems difficult to merge.</p>
<p>The future development of events may depend on the preference of British Prime Minister MacDonald on either side of the seesaw. If the United Kingdom does not express its willingness to temporarily stabilize the currency, the US President may not be willing to allow national management of exchange rates to crack down on speculation. Regardless, everyone expects the representatives of the gold countries to make speeches today, reiterating their views on mutual assistance to maintain the gold standard. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Tonight, the fate of the World Economic Conference is in the hands of US President Roosevelt. If he cannot make even the slightest concession, there will be a motion for indefinite adjournment of the conference. However, according to Washington sources, the US President's attitude remains as firm as before. Therefore, the chief representatives of various countries are mostly preparing to pack up and return home, temporarily leaving the deputy representatives and advisors to preside over the affairs of the delegation, and then come to England after the US President has an accommodating response to the final stability plan.

<h3>Five Gold Standard Countries in Tense Atmosphere Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing Draft Proposal to Submit to Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Demanding Curb on Currency Speculation Mania</p>
<p>(London) Today, representatives from the gold standard countries of France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland held a meeting. For a time, all attention was focused on this meeting. Later, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain joined the discussion, making the atmosphere even more tense. (National News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives from the five European gold standard countries met today with British Prime Minister MacDonald, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and British economic experts and advisors, including Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, to discuss currency stabilization. The meeting began at 5:00 PM and continued until 2:00 AM. The afternoon discussion focused on production, with most speakers mentioning the maintenance of the gold standard and preserving the status of gold standard countries. What resolutions were made at this meeting, or what developments occurred, have not yet been announced. However, it is reported that significant progress has been made on the issue of currency stabilization. Prior to this meeting, the representatives of the gold standard countries had held several talks. Dutch representative Colijn and French representative Bonnet were particularly active. It is said that the British delegation has submitted a memorandum to the currency stabilization committee of the conference, but the contents are currently kept secret. After the meeting, French representative Bonnet told a Reuters reporter that the representatives are now engaged in drafting a very practical and resolute declaration on currency stabilization. He also said that the gold standard countries unanimously recognize the necessity of making every effort to maintain the stability of their currencies and are now preparing a declaration stating their views. Britain and the United States may join if they wish. However, in any case, the French declaration will definitely be issued. Tonight's news reports that the gold standard countries have established a temporary agreement, but the contents have not yet been made public. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) When the representatives of various countries gathered at the Economic Conference venue this morning, they all had the question of whether to extend the conference in mind. The European gold standard countries held an important meeting to discuss a draft proposal to be submitted to Britain and the United States. Everyone is eager to know the outcome of this meeting. It is said that the wording of the draft proposal concerning the fate of the Economic Conference is very firm. Some say that it would be more appropriate to call it an ultimatum rather than a draft proposal. According to reliable sources, if Britain and the United States do not declare within a week of the presentation of this proposal that they will crack down on speculation on certain European currencies, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries will no longer participate in the Economic Conference. The meeting of representatives from the gold standard countries lasted for one and a half hours, adjourning at 11:45 AM. The atmosphere at that time was still not relaxed. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Judging from the current situation, the final draft proposal currently under consideration by the gold standard countries is based on the outline of Britain's proposed measures to crack down on currency speculation. It is generally believed that if this draft is adopted, it will be acceptable to President Roosevelt. It is reported that this proposal has been revised nine times. Each revision moves further away from France's demand for an immediate declaration of stabilization and closer to Britain's proposed reconciliation plan. The reason for this trend is Italy's inclination towards the British viewpoint. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, all the plans proposed by the gold standard countries were rejected by the U.S. delegation. Late at night, the gold standard countries made a final appeal to the U.S. President through the U.S. delegation. According to a British supporter of the gold standard, this is the final plan, a simple solution to curb currency speculation mania. It is the only possible compromise between open currency war and real currency stabilization. The proposal suggests that Britain and the United States cooperate under a system of human management to help gold standard countries curb speculation. This plan was drafted in a secret meeting attended by MacDonald and Chamberlain. (National News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Since the gold standard countries of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands presented a final new plan to the U.S. President, Washington has not only had no encouraging news, but it is also heard that officials and advisors in the U.S. Treasury have not even considered the stabilization plan once. The new plan proposed by the gold standard countries is now the target of discussion in the conference break room. Some believe it is meaningless, clearly a face-saving scheme to appease public opinion in the gold standard countries and prevent small countries from threatening to withdraw from the conference. (National News Agency dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(London) A Reuters reporter asked Dutch Prime Minister Colijn, chairman of the Economic Committee, whether a compromise had been reached with the Bank of England. Colijn replied, "We are currently adjourned until the afternoon and have not yet made a final decision." The afternoon meeting is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM, at which time British Prime Minister MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will both attend. The British Prime Minister also attended the morning meeting. When adjourning, MacDonald was asked about the results of the morning meeting. He replied, "We are just having another talk." Rumors were rife this morning. The rumors intensified when it was heard that Bank of England Governor Montagu Norman had gone to Southampton for a brief conversation with the British Prime Minister. One of the major difficulties currently encountered by the British side is the strong tendency of the British Dominions to link British and American currencies. They are unwilling to fix the price of the pound to the franc. If the pound cannot be linked to the U.S. dollar, they advocate uniting and stabilizing the countries using the gold pound. It is also said that another difficulty for the British side is the differing opinions of the Treasury and the Bank of England. It is rumored that the Bank favors a continental European currency alliance. French Finance Minister Bonnet had originally planned to depart for Paris this afternoon to report to the cabinet, but has now postponed his departure until tonight to await the results of the afternoon currency conference. After Bonnet left the conference venue this morning, no good news was naturally sent to France. He told a Reuters reporter that Britain has not yet shown any signs of endorsing the gold standard countries. As far as France's attitude towards the Economic Conference is concerned, the next cabinet meeting in Paris will be extremely important, because the decision on whether to extend the Economic Conference will depend on Bonnet's report. In its memorandum on the subsidy issue issued today, France reiterated that currency stabilization is more important than anything else, stating that the current currency devaluation is the most serious and obvious subsidy because it reduces currency prices and lowers domestic costs. Therefore, the restoration of currency stability is a necessary condition for effectively reducing subsidies or premiums. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Professor Moley Indicates Unwillingness to Discuss Currency Stabilization</h3>
<p>But Agrees to Cooperating in Curbing Speculation</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that Professor Moley has notified British Prime Minister MacDonald that the United States is not currently prepared to discuss currency stabilization, but can participate in an international exchange plan to prevent wild speculative fluctuations in currencies without hindering President Roosevelt's exercise of his right to inflate the currency. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Since U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Moley arrived in England, he has completely failed to resolve the opposition of various countries to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Today, he met with British Prime Minister MacDonald for an hour. MacDonald earnestly requested stabilizing the U.S. dollar to save the conference, but Moley told reporters afterwards that he was still unable to reach an agreement and stated with a somewhat disappointed attitude that stabilizing currency prices is not yet the theme of the conference. It is now believed that after meeting with the British Prime Minister, Moley will issue an important statement at the next principal committee meeting. Many believe that Moley will make a final attempt to save the conference at that time. (National News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. Treasury issued an official statement denying that Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Acheson and Budget Director Douglas had met with financial expert Gordon Wasson to discuss a plan to stabilize the gold dollar. Since the London Economic Conference reached a deadlock, there have been widespread rumors in the United States that these three were hastily meeting to discuss a counter-proposal to be submitted to the World Economic Conference. Therefore, the Treasury specifically denied this, stating that Acheson and Douglas have never considered any plan. However, outside interpretations of this statement vary. Some say that this matter is entirely handled by the President. The President is currently in the north, and it is not known here whether there are new instructions for the delegation. (National News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>Currency Crisis: Behind the Gold Screen There Is Also Silver</h3>
<p>(London) The U.S. delegation gathered as usual this morning, but the meeting only lasted ten minutes. It is reported that the stabilization issue was not discussed. However, Professor Moley, Secretary of State Hull, U.S. Treasury Advisor Sprague, and U.S. representative Cox discussed for over an hour, reportedly discussing what steps the United States should take to resolve the gold crisis. However, the gold issue is not the only event in today's deadlock. Behind the scenes, there is also the silver crisis. U.S. representatives and Indian representatives also have different opinions on the silver issue. Indian representative is unwilling to be bound by a long-term agreement restricting the sale of silver according to the U.S. representative's proposal. In addition, the difficulty of reducing wheat fields remains difficult to resolve. This morning, the major wheat-producing countries reopened the meeting and decided to send a telegram to the Australian government to describe everything in detail. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Preparing to Adopt British Methods to Stabilize the Exchange Market</h3>
<p>(London) This afternoon, a member of the U.S. delegation told a reporter from the Associated Press that the U.S. Federal Reserve is seriously considering purchasing gold dollars to curb the surge and fall of the exchange market. A broad management policy similar to the British Exchange Equalization Fund will also be decided upon soon. It is heard that the content of the talks between U.S. Treasury economic advisor Sprague and representatives of the central banks of European gold standard countries is trending towards an agreement whereby the gold standard countries agree not to artificially interfere with the gold dollar exchange rate, but only to sincerely crack down on speculation by their own people in the exchange market. However, according to reliable sources, the U.S. President is still not prepared to conclude a temporary stabilization agreement and does not want to be subject to any restrictions that would interfere with the exercise of his newly acquired power to reduce the gold content of the gold dollar. (National News Agency dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Inevitably Anxious About the Fall of the Gold Dollar</h3>
<p>(London) According to a news dispatch that is said to be not without basis, Washington authorities are now gradually becoming anxious about the downward trend of the U.S. dollar and its impact on world monetary relations. U.S. officials are now worried that the current policy is doing more harm than good. U.S. authorities may change their uncompromising attitude, yield to a temporary stabilization plan, and discuss ways to limit fluctuations in the U.S. dollar. However, this change of heart does not necessarily mean that President Roosevelt will agree to any stopgap measures regarding currency that would hinder his claim to raise domestic prices. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Currency Deadlock Affects British and American Foreign Exchange Markets</h3>
<p>(London) The deadlock of the Economic Conference has left foreign exchange market traders at a loss. Yesterday, the opening price of the New York gold dollar against the British exchange rate was $4.27, then weakened to $4.29, and then returned to $4.25. The trading volume of offsetting various items was quite large, but later someone was willing to sell at a price of $4.28. Other currency prices were stable. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The price of the gold dollar fluctuated today on the international market, causing the U.S. stock market to change accordingly. Exchange merchants and financial experts are puzzled by the cause of this fluctuation and suspect that speculators are manipulating it behind the scenes, hoping to force the United States to agree to European proposals. As of today, Washington has no other comment on the situation in London regarding the stabilization issue other than Treasury denials. (National News Agency dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>Differences of Opinion on the Wheat Issue Gradually Dissipating</h3>
<p>Possibility of Establishing a Temporary Agreement</p>
<p>(London) The wheat issue seems to have the possibility of a temporary agreement today. The differences between Australia and other wheat-producing countries have now gradually melted. The wheat committee was scheduled to meet at 5:00 PM this afternoon, but the meeting was immediately postponed without discussion because experts did not have enough time to prepare figures based on the Australian government's slightly revised request to revise the basis of the agreement. However, experts will work overnight on the Australian government's latest proposal, which may lead to a unified and flexible agreement. After the draft is completed, Australian representative Bruce will send a telegram to Australia to be submitted to the meeting of representatives from the four major wheat-producing provinces of Australia on Saturday and Sunday for their consideration. The current situation seems to indicate that Australia may agree to a method of reducing wheat fields, but importing countries must not implement restrictions and import quotas. In other words, importing countries must no longer protect their own agriculture. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<p>(London) Interesting suggestions were made at the meetings of the Currency and Economics Committees today. At the meeting of the currency sub-committee, someone proposed establishing an international gold standard, with the necessary institutions attached to ensure satisfactory operation. It was advocated that an independent bank be established with the right to freely implement appropriate currency and credit policies. This proposal was based on the reason that there is currently no sufficient central banking system. At the same time, at the meeting of the third sub-committee of the Economic Committee, which considered shipping subsidies and other matters, France proposed a plan to establish several international agreements on ocean-going merchant ship operations in order to eliminate competition and limit future shipbuilding. This plan stipulates that each shipping route should operate jointly under its own national flag and establish a system for sharing income and expenses. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>Activities of the Japanese Delegation</h3>
<p>Contacting Britain and the United States on Tariff Issues</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that the Japanese delegation to the World Economic Conference has contacted the British and American delegations to arrange for bilateral tariff negotiations. Japanese financial figure Muto told a Reuters reporter today that if the currencies of Britain, the United States, and France are stabilized, Japan will consider stabilizing the Japanese yen, but is currently unable to do so because Japan's gold reserves are low. He believes that a satisfactory price rate should be close to today's price. (Reuters dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>New Invention of Sugar Production from Wood Amidst Calls to Limit Sugar Production</h3>
<p>(New York) At a time when the sugar industry is in decline and seeking to limit production, there is news that is unwelcome to New York sugar tycoons. According to the American Chemical Society, Professor Hagglund of Sweden has invented a new method of producing sugar from wood. One hundred kilograms of wood can produce sixty kilograms of sugar and four to six kilograms of acetic acid, and the process is quite simple. It only requires special refining with concentrated hydrochloric acid, so the cost is extremely low, and it is not difficult to produce millions of tons per year at a very low price. However, those in the sugar production and refining industry here hope that the sugar produced from wood may not be able to compete with cane sugar and beet sugar in terms of quality, as they have not mentioned the quality.

<h3>Britain Actively Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Privy Council President Baldwin Advocates Cooperation Between British and Indian Textile Industries</p>
<p>A Nationwide Boycott Movement Cannot Be Stopped by Force</p>
<h3>Japan to Establish Trade Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>(London) Today, Privy Council President Baldwin gave a speech in Manchester, stating briefly that India and Lancashire should cooperate and enter into an agreement. He also stated that the issue of tariffs is now being planned. He does not believe that a nationwide boycott movement can be stopped by force. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Consul General Murai in Sydney to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Australian government, based on the Domestic Industry Protection Act, has entrusted the tariff revision案 for rubber shoes to the Tariff Review Committee and plans to entrust the taxation of cotton velvet, ammonium sulfate, pottery, and electric bulbs to the Tariff Review Committee. All of the above are Japanese goods, and the goal of repelling Japanese goods is obvious. Consul General Murai telegraphed for instructions to seek appropriate countermeasures to prevent this from happening in advance. (Den Tsushin dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to place the diplomatic focus after withdrawing from the League of Nations on economic diplomacy. The first proposal has been internally decided to establish a Trade Investigation Committee in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Trade Bureau will study the committee's official system and budget. The committee will be modeled after the Tariff Investigation Committee. Its composition is as follows: (1) Chairman: concurrently the Minister of Foreign Affairs; (2) Members: Vice-Ministers, Bureau and Section Chiefs of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, and Colonial Affairs, representatives from both houses of the Diet, representatives from private industry and trade, scholars, etc., totaling 30 people; (3) Concerning trade issues, accept government consultations, deliberate and respond, and may propose to the government; (4) The committee may be divided into subcommittees according to market area and commodity type. The reason why the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed the committee案 is that future trade issues and tariff issues cannot be resolved by treaty policy alone and must be based on organized trade policy. Therefore, as soon as the official details are decided, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will include it in the budget for implementation from next year. (Den Tsushin dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance announced the amount of overseas trade at major ports nationwide in late June as follows (unit: 1,000 yen):</p>

<p>Export surplus: 10,883</p>
<p>Since January, the cumulative import deficit is 184,367, compared to the same period last year with a cumulative import deficit of 265,030. (Den Tsushin dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<h3>Crisis of Japanese-Russian Conflict</h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Takes the Opportunity to Move</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The atmosphere towards Russia is very dangerous within the Japanese Navy Ministry. Many young officers advocate conquering Russia. There are two reasons for this: one is that Japan cannot rest easy while Northern Sakhalin Island is in Russian hands, and if it obtains the entire Sakhalin Island, it can solve the Japanese Navy's fuel problem; the other is to compete with the Army for merit. Since September 18th, the Army has regarded itself as the master of the new Japan. Therefore, on January 28th of last year, the Navy chose to start an incident in Shanghai, which turned into a mess. Since then, it has been depressed and wants to seize this opportunity to establish merit and avenge its humiliation. The Seiyukai party, upon hearing of this matter, believes that if the North Sea fishermen incident is not resolved through a conspiracy, it is feared that the Japanese-Russian Special Committee will designate committee members to study its settlement. (Hua Lian She dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>An bizarre twist was added to the Japanese-Russian Kamchatka incident in today's report from Petropavlovsk. According to news received here from Kamchatka, when the Soviet Union sent personnel to the location indicated by the Japanese as the place where Japanese fishermen were killed to conduct an independent investigation, they suddenly saw that the coastal patrol station that was originally there had been destroyed, and the soldiers were all missing. An investigation is continuing. Although the destruction of the coastal patrol station is not necessarily related to the Kamchatka incident, the authorities are deeply concerned because the circumstances are strange.

<h3>Inside Story of Takahashi's Request for Leave</h3>
<p>Hua Lian She dispatch of the 30th from Tokyo: Finance Minister Takahashi formally raised the issue of requesting leave to treat his illness at today's cabinet meeting. It is heard that Takahashi has obtained Saito's consent to be granted a month's leave from the 3rd of next month to go to Hayama for recuperation. Ministerial affairs will be handled by Vice-Ministers Horikiri and Kuroda. According to Japanese political circles, since Takahashi remained in office, three cabinet members from the Seiyukai party, Shibusawa and Hatoyama, have made things difficult for Takahashi in everything. The Seiyukai party has also forced Mizuno Rentaro to resign from the chairmanship of the Legislative Council and opposed amendments to the election law案, etc., with many evil schemes, which are disgusting. Takahashi, in order to reject the conspiracy of the Seiyukai party, has requested leave on the pretext of illness to observe the Seiyukai party's attitude.</p>
<p>Japan United Press dispatch of the 30th from Tokyo: Foreign Minister Uchida had previously decided to transfer Director-General Tani Asia Bureau and Director Shiratori Information Bureau due to the resignation of Vice-Minister Arita. Shiratori has been appointed Ambassador to Sweden, but Director-General Tani Asia Bureau has not been transferred due to the lack of a suitable successor. The Foreign Minister has now decided to appoint Consul General Kuwashima Keizo, stationed in Tianjin, as the Director-General of the Asia Bureau. An order for Kuwashima to return home was issued on the 29th, and the official order will be announced around the 10th of next month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Assassination Case Exposes Secrets of the Military</h3>
<p>Military comrades not only plotting to assassinate political parties and zaibatsu</p>
<p>Even military factions within the military were planned to be purged.</p>
<h3>Assassination Attempt on Minister of the Imperial Household Makino Fails</h3>
<p>Den Tsushin dispatch of the 30th from Tokyo: The second public trial of the Blood Pledge Assassination Group incident opened at 9:00 AM today in the Tokyo District Court courtroom. Inoue Nissho said, "We do not aim to assassinate merely for the sake of assassination; this is only a means. My comrades tend to protect me. If it were not for this Inoue, then this incident and the May 15th incident would not have occurred." His response was different from the previous one and was quite spirited. At 10:00 AM, the interrogation of Furuichi began. After stating his relationship with Inoue and others, Furuichi replied, "On January 31, Showa 7, in an empty house near the residence of Gondo Seikyo, it was decided to assassinate twenty prominent figures in the political and financial worlds, and Inoue was requested to carry out this assassination task at Gondo's residence." At noon, there was a recess. The court reopened at 1:30 PM and questioned Shibamoto Yoshitaka. The defendant stated his resume, saying that he had transferred from the Seventh High School to the Imperial University and had known his ideology since meeting Inoue Nissho, which he deeply respected. He approved of the claim to reform the country, accepted the task of assassinating Minister of the Imperial Household Makino, and sought opportunities. The guard at Minister Makino's residence was severe, and he realized that one person was of no help. Therefore, he consulted with Inoue, and Tagura Yoshiyuki helped him. On February 10, Showa 7, he received a Browning pistol with fifty bullets from Inoue Nissho and delivered it to Tagura. He lodged at the Mita Inn near Minister Makino's residence to investigate the movements of the Minister. He also said that after Shohei assassinated former Minister Inoue Junnosuke, he ordered Tagura and Mori Kenkichi to return to Kyoto to deceive the ears of the authorities. Furthermore, he stated that the comrades in the military not only planned to purge the political parties and zaibatsu, but also the military factions with improper and unjust forces within the military, thus exposing the secrets of the military. Finally, he said, "Now I realize that others and I are really no different, and I deny all revolutions rooted in the concept of opposition. Now, I only have to complete myself and be filled with the desire to live." Unlike Inoue Nissho and Furuichi, he returned to idealism and expressed his remorse. At this point, today's public trial ended, and the court was adjourned at 4:10 PM. The next public trial is scheduled for July 3 to continue the hearing.</p>
<p>Japan United Press dispatch of the 30th from Tokyo: The second public trial of the Blood Pledge Assassination Group conspiracy incident opened at 9:00 AM today. The security was still tight. The judge originally planned to question the defendant Furuichi about the facts of the crime, but the defendant Inoue suddenly requested to speak, saying that the Navy victim and other comrades, because I harmed their health, wanted to reduce my responsibility. However, I believe that if there were no Inoue, the May 15th incident would not have occurred. I am not afraid of anything, and I practice the spirit of breaking down the privileged class, leading me to this day. Therefore, the responsibility for this case rests entirely on me.</p>
<h3>Changes in Japanese Foreign Policy (Japan News)</h3>
<p>Japan has recently experienced a huge change in its foreign policy, which is to abandon its long-time friend Britain and openly advocate friendship with its imaginary enemy, the United States. The fact that India, Australia, and other places have successively boycotted Japanese goods has already been clearly demonstrated. It is feared that in the future, all British Empire territories and autonomous territories will use higher tariffs to restrict the import of Japanese textiles and other manufactured goods. Japan then uses not buying Indian cotton and Australian wool as a boycott, but this boycott does not seem to be able to restore the goodwill of India and other autonomous territories and colonies under the leadership of the British Empire towards Japan, but instead provokes greater anger, making the Japanese foreign market feel a huge threat. If it is really implemented, then the Japanese textile industry, which is relatively excellent in the East, will suffer a great blow. Therefore, the business circles of Japan have been meeting everywhere in important cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Kobe to plan countermeasures, but until now, they have not found a real and effective method that can be implemented. They only use not buying Indian cotton and not buying wool as a passive resistance.</p>
<p>Politically, Britain and Japan have many of the same interests and places where they need to cooperate, especially in dealing with the Soviet Union and blocking its development to the east. Secondly, in their China policy, they also have the same position in suppressing China's national revolution, upward development, and acting in a united step, but recently the Soviet Union's foreign policy has shifted to peaceful conservatism, and Britain is therefore relieved that its interests in India and the Persian oil fields will not be in danger. At the same time, regarding China's market relations, Britain also clearly sees Japan's radicalism, because at first Japan only said that it was protecting the vested interests of "Manchuria" and volunteered to be the international vanguard against communism, so Britain acquiesced in its military action, but recently Japan has not only turned Manchuria into a second Korea, but also seized Jehol and probed into eastern Hebei, and wants to take control of Tianjin</p>
<h3>Tokyo Smallpox Epidemic</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Tokyo, 30th) Smallpox is currently spreading in Tokyo, so approximately one million people have been forced to be vaccinated in the past few days. When the disease was first discovered, it was mistakenly identified as chickenpox, leading to a rampant spread, with 56 people now infected. Two elementary schools have been closed as a preventative measure.</p>
<p>The Japanese are creating a second puppet regime, calling people like Li Jichun and Zhao Lei, Shi Fengming, to come forward. They will first establish empty titles such as Commander-in-Chief Headquarters and General Headquarters, while Japanese reserve officers and generals will command from behind. If successful, they will invade North China. Even if they fail, they can at least use it as a bargaining chip to reduce tariffs. Naturally, those with interests in the Kailuan coal mines and the Beining Railway will witness this situation, and British interests in North China will be shaken. Moreover, the Japanese army stationed in the three northeastern provinces and Rehe is also preparing to sweep Inner Mongolia and Chahar.</p>
<p>Therefore, the political relationship between Britain and Japan has shifted from alliance to separation. If Japan completely loses British assistance, and even faces tariff restrictions on Japanese goods throughout the British Empire, should that truly happen, Japan will fall from nominal isolation to substantial economic isolation. This is what Japan fears most, especially given its current dire economic situation. However, Japan cannot adopt the same means against Britain as it does against China. So, what will it do? For an immediate solution, Japan understands that the United States is busy resolving its domestic issues and is not very active in the Pacific power struggle. Furthermore, the investment and export trade to the Chinese market differ in quality and quantity. Japan mainly exports light industrial products to China, followed by marine products, while the United States mainly exports heavy industrial products. Although agricultural products have suddenly increased recently due to special circumstances, the trade relationship between the United States and China is not as sharply opposed as that between Japan and Britain. There is still some room for reconciliation between Japan and the United States. For example, Japan needs steel, coal, and oil, while the United States needs raw silk, etc. There is a possibility of achieving reconciliation in economics. Therefore, since the issue of India's increased tariffs arose, some Japanese have shifted from anti-American rhetoric to pro-American arguments. Even those who previously advocated war against the United States are now silent. The first step in this transformation is to break the current deadlock, eliminate the traces of the Republican administration's policies towards Japan, and start with diplomacy. When Matsuoka Yosuke visited the United States, he laid the groundwork and tried his best to seek understanding from the Democratic leaders towards Japan. Now they are planning to have Matsukata Kojiro or Matsuoka Yosuke replace Debuchi Katsuji as the ambassador to the United States, which will open a new chapter in Japanese-American diplomacy. However, the timeframe of this situation is very short. The interests between Japan and the United States cannot ultimately be harmonized, but it is a way to seek temporary stability at the moment. Therefore, Japan's policy towards China must also change. (June 21st)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Two North China Problems</h3>
<p>Regarding the North China issue after the signing of the truce agreement, the most recent matters attracting public attention are: first, how to resolve the problem of the puppet troops rampaging in the demilitarized zone; and second, how to deal with the situation in Chahar after Feng Yuxiang raised the banner of resistance against Japan. The former could have been viewed as a domestic bandit suppression incident, but recently it has become necessary to discuss solutions with the military representatives who are manipulating them from behind. The latter appears to be an action of resisting the enemy and defending against aggression, but recently its focus has shifted to domestic political relations. Although the nature of the two issues is different, the authorities in Beiping, considering the complexity of the content of the issues, are trying to resolve them through peaceful means. Their efforts are also well-intentioned.</p>
<p>People like Li Jichun and Zhao Lei are manipulated by the Japanese to disrupt various places in eastern Hebei, and at the same time, they use the name of the anti-Japanese army to conceal their relationship with the Japanese. Even on the surface, they are neither Chinese nor Japanese, but simply bandits who have risen opportunistically. Northern commentators, based on the principles of the truce agreement, advocate clarifying the status of Li Zhao and others with the Japanese in order to resolve the issue. They believe that if the Japanese army admits that the puppet troops are part of their force that invaded the Great Wall, they should withdraw to the line of the Great Wall according to the agreement. If they consider them unrelated, they should allow the Chinese army to suppress them. Although this is merely theoretical, it is still a suggestion that could facilitate the resolution of the puppet troop problem. If, as reported by newspapers and telegrams recently, the puppet troops have achieved their goal of being incorporated and are allowed to remain in eastern Hebei, then even if the problem is resolved, the hidden dangers will remain. Such a resolution will still leave behind some problems, so the authorities' hard work in handling this matter is known to us. Making compromises to avoid the emergence of complications is also out of necessity. However, after the incorporation, the authorities should plan early on how to transform them into a security police force that is somewhat reliable and how to ensure that their continued presence in the area does not hinder the takeover of various places, in order to avoid future disputes.</p>
<p>When the truce negotiations were underway, Feng Yuxiang, knowing that the people's anger towards foreign aggression was increasing, declared armed protection of Chahar Province and began his extraordinary actions. Whether this kind of action is appropriate or not can be temporarily set aside. However, since May 26th, after more than a month, the people have not seen his achievements in resisting the war, and they cannot help but have doubts about his so-called "only helping to lead his troops to fight against foreign aggression and never seek to establish a separatist regime." If we compare the excitement of the people towards Ma Zhanshan's resistance against Japan in Heilongjiang Province and the enthusiastic assistance to the 19th Route Army's defense against the enemy in Shanghai with today's attitude towards the Chahar incident, we cannot simply feel emotional about Feng's situation. The recent impasse in Chahar lies in Feng's unwillingness to leave Zhangjiakou, causing Song Zheyuan to be unable to return to Chahar. We believe that the personal matter of Feng's stay or departure is small. If the various armies can, as stated in his telegraphs, sincerely work to recover the lost territory before launching an attack, then it seems that there would be no difficult problems for Song Zheyuan to lead his troops back to the town. The resolution of the Chahar situation also seems difficult but is actually easy. What we cannot help but feel emotional about is that the saying that the national crisis is profound is on everyone's lips, but today's North China is preoccupied with these kinds of problems, attracting the attention of the people. Even if these problems are resolved as desired, what benefit will it bring to the elimination of the national crisis?</p>
<p>Negotiations for the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Russian and Puppet Claims Differ Greatly</p>
<p>Puppet Organization Demands Purchase at a Discounted Price</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Demands Security for the Maritime Province</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the claims of Japan, Russia, and Manchukuo are becoming clear, and the valuations of Japan and Russia differ greatly. According to the Toyo Keizai Shinpo, the claims of the puppet state, i.e., Japan, are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese Eastern Railway has a very wide gauge, five feet, which is inconvenient for direct traffic with the South Manchurian Railway. In the future, it should be changed to a four-foot, eight-inch gauge, which will require huge expenses.</p>
<p>(2) The 400 million rubles of construction costs proposed by the Russian side include urban construction costs and school operating costs, which should be deducted.</p>
<p>(3) The line has been severely dilapidated recently and has undergone major repairs in the past, making it unusable. Currently, the monthly deficit reaches two to three million rubles.</p>
<p>(4) The puppet state plans to build parallel lines and longitudinal lines, which have little economic value.</p>
<p>(5) Since the Japanese army entered northern Manchuria, all real power has been in the hands of the Kwantung Army, which has lost its aggressive nature from the time of Imperial Russia.</p>
<p>Japan and Manchukuo are unwilling to pay a fair price based on the above reasons, while the Russian side claims as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway not only sells the railway but also completely withdraws all economic power from it. Therefore, it cannot be valued solely based on the Chinese Eastern Railway itself.</p>
<p>(2) Russia has voluntarily withdrawn from northern Manchuria, and Japan and Manchukuo should also stop their aggression against northern Sakhalin and the Maritime Province from now on. (3) The Chinese Eastern Railway is able to sustain itself in the environment of the world's economic crisis. The current losses are due to Japanese military actions and should not be used as a reason to reduce its valuation. (30th, China United Press)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Party newspaper Izvestia stated in an editorial today that the negotiations for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway will reveal whether Japan has sincere intentions for peace in the Far East. It also refuted the claim that this incident exposed Soviet Russia's weakness, saying that the Russian government has no political interests in Manchuria, only economic interests, which are based on the railway itself. It also said that Soviet Russia is unwilling to be drawn into the competition for spheres of influence, which is not in line with Soviet Russia's foreign policy. It then refuted the reports in Japanese newspapers that Russia will sell Vladivostok and eastern Siberia, calling them laughable rumors. It said that the Japanese are spreading rumors in order to reduce the 800 million Japanese yen that Soviet Russia is asking for the Chinese Eastern Railway, which the Russian people naturally do not find worth laughing at.

<h3>Progress in British-Russian Negotiations</h3>
<p>Trade Conflict Expected to be Resolved</p>
<p>(London) Today, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov and British Foreign Secretary Simon issued a joint communique after meeting for half an hour, stating that negotiations are making progress but are not yet complete, and a fourth meeting is expected to be held soon. It is said that the British-Russian trade conflict is expected to be completely resolved. (30th, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>New US Naval Policy</h3>
<p>Establish a Main Base on the Pacific Coast</p>
<p>A Great Threat to Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) The new declaration of US naval policy drafted by the Navy Department, approved by Naval Chief of Staff Swanson on May 10th, was announced today. It stated that two main bases must be built on both coasts, and a fleet with the most powerful combat capability should be built within the scope allowed by the London Treaty. It also stated that the United States needs all the airships that have been built and are under construction, marines to perform various duties, and should be prepared to send expeditions at any time. (30th, Reuters) (Tokyo) The US Navy announced a new naval policy on the 29th, advocating the construction of bases along the Pacific coast. The Japanese Navy stated in response that it had not received a report on the US Navy's new naval policy statement, but judging from the US's previous announcement of a large-scale shipbuilding plan, there is certainly a possibility of this fact. However, the US Navy's decision to make Prebleton, the location of the new base, has always had naval port facilities and the ability to repair large ships, etc. Now, the purpose of making a special statement seems to be a prelude to actively implementing a large-scale naval expansion. In this sense, the US statement this time is quite noteworthy. (30th, News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan Monopolizes Major Industries in the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese government has actively planned to seize the resources of our Eastern Provinces. It is reported that, under the guise of joint ventures, various companies will be established from this autumn, and all industries will be exclusively operated by these companies. Others will not be able to engage in the same business. The names of the companies are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Manchuria Communications Company, monopolizing all electrical businesses.</p>
<p>(2) Manchuria Oil Company, monopolizing the oil mines of the four provinces.</p>
<p>(3) Manchuria Coal Industry Company, controlling all coal mines.</p>
<p>(4) Manchuria Aluminum Industry Company, monopolizing the aluminum mines of the four provinces.</p>
<p>(5) Manchuria Gold Mining Company, monopolizing all gold mines.</p>
<p>(6) Manchuria Alcohol Company, monopolizing the alcohol industry of the four provinces.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned businesses, Japanese merchants are allowed to freely operate various businesses in Manchuria. (30th, China United Press)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes New Customs Import Tariff with Slight Amendments After Review</h3>
<p>Constitutional Drafting Committee Decides to Change Drafting Procedure</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan held a plenary session on the morning of the 30th, it first secretly discussed the new customs import tariff. The Ministry of Finance has already implemented the plan, which needs to go through legislative procedures. Last week, after the joint review by the Finance and Economics Committees of the Yuan, slight amendments were made, and the proposal was submitted to the plenary session today for discussion. It was generally passed according to the review proposal, but it has not yet been finalized and will be discussed at the next plenary session. (30th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Adjournment Next Month is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter interviewed someone from the Legislative Yuan. It is rumored that the Yuan will adjourn next month and change the office hours to half a day, which is not accurate. The Yuan will start holding meetings earlier next week and will make even more efforts than usual. (30th, Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 24th meeting on the 30th, with more than 60 people including Wang Qi, Ma Yinchu, and Ma Chaojun attending. Sun Ke presided, and Secretary-General Liang Hancao. The meeting started in secret and had not ended by noon. It was heard that they were discussing the new customs import tariff. The Ministry of Finance had already implemented the plan, which needed to go through legislative procedures, so it was submitted for discussion. The joint meeting of the Finance and Economic Committees spent two days reviewing it last week and only made slight amendments. There were three items on the public agenda on the 30th, and the meeting will continue in the afternoon. After the general meeting, the Constitutional Drafting Committee will continue to hold a general meeting to discuss the issue of changing the draft constitutional procedure. (30th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Members of the Autonomy Investigation Committee Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The members of the Autonomy Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, who had previously gone to various parts of the country to investigate the actual situation of local autonomy, have now returned to Beijing one after another. Huang Youchang, the convener of the committee, and member Zhu Hezhong, only returned to Beijing on the 29th. According to Zhu, they went to various parts of North China for investigation, which lasted for more than a month. They went to Qingdao, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces one after another, and the results were good. Shandong Zouping and Hebei Dingxian have achieved great results in handling local autonomy. There are no beggars in Shanxi Province, which is a very good phenomenon. (30th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>A Certain Diplomat Discusses the Conclusion of an Arbitration Treaty Between Japan and the United States</h3>
<p>Unilateral Propaganda by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Although the US official has denied the conclusion of an arbitration treaty between Japan and the United States, the Japanese side is still conducting negotiations for propaganda. For this reason, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited a certain diplomat to inquire about his observations. According to the interview, Japan's foreign policy has changed significantly since its withdrawal from the League of Nations. Before Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, on the one hand, the United States repeatedly stated that it would not recognize the results of aggression, and on the other hand, there was a historical alliance between Britain and Japan. Therefore, Japan's foreign policy at this time was to unite with Britain and contain the United States. After withdrawing from the League of Nations, due to the Indian tariff issue, a serious economic conflict arose between Britain and Japan. The anti-British sentiment in Japan became increasingly fierce. Even in the World Economic Conference, it revealed an attitude of attacking Britain. It can be seen that the ill feelings between Britain and Japan are deepening day by day and will develop from economic conflicts to political conflicts. In order to avoid isolation from the League of Nations, the Japanese side shifted its focus and adopted a policy of uniting with the United States and containing Britain. However, the United States' foreign policy is not only traditionally consistent but also tends to shift from the Monroe Doctrine to a more active approach. Although the Japanese side has tried its best to coordinate and attempt to conclude an arbitration treaty, Japan's diplomacy, which has always lacked credibility, will certainly fail to win the trust of the United States. Judging from the repeated denials by American officials, it can be seen that the Japanese propaganda is entirely one-sided. (30th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Use and Custody of US Cotton and Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>Supplementary Opinions of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan passed the US Cotton and Wheat Loan case, it attached two opinions on use and custody before passing it to the Central Political Council.

<h3>Water Level of North Shandong Canal Rises</h3>
<p>The Yellow River Remains Calm</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Due to continuous heavy rain, the water level of the North Shandong Canal has continued to rise. The Construction Department received a long-distance phone call today from Sun Chaiyun, a technician stationed in Wucheng, reporting that the water level of the canal within Wucheng has reached 29.8 meters, and the situation is critical. After supervising the staff to work hard to protect it, it was fortunate that no danger occurred. In the afternoon, the water level dropped by two centimeters. Subsequently, a long-distance phone call was received from Sun Weihan, a technician stationed in Linqing, reporting that the canal's water level continued to rise, reaching 33.01 meters today. The highest water level in Linqing last autumn was only 34 feet. Now, before the major flood season, it is not much different from the highest water level, which is a rare phenomenon in recent years. Based on this, the Construction Department has telegraphed the magistrates of the six counties along the river—Linqing, Wucheng, De County, Guantao, Xiajin, and En County—and the technical personnel stationed in the county by the department to work hard to protect the area and not be negligent.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after the Yellow River in Zhengzhou rose by three feet, the provincial river affairs bureau immediately telegraphed the heads of all sections along the river to pay close attention. As of today, the water level has not risen significantly, and the working conditions are stable. The water level is around 28 meters, which is still three feet lower than the highest water level in the 20th year. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, said that although the current Yellow River water level is not low, it is still far from the danger line. The bureau has ordered all river workers to pay attention to protection, but also not to overreact, falsely report the water level, and shake people's hearts. The spring maintenance project this year was very good, and there has not been any unexpected major flood. It is possible that there will be no worries. Over a thousand sections of stone dikes have been completed along the entire river. Currently, stone materials are being purchased and transported to continue the repair. If the entire river is replaced with stone dikes, the Yellow River will surely reduce the risk of breaching in the future. (29th)</p>
<h3>Disastrous Flooding in Hunan Province</h3>
<p>=The Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers all Flood at Different Times=</p>
<p>Disaster Spreads, Counties Report Disaster</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has not stopped. In the upper reaches of western and southern Hunan, mountain floods have erupted, and the accumulated water has not receded. At the same time, the Yuan, Li, Xiang, and Zi Rivers have risen sharply, with floods overflowing and spreading, creating a disaster. More than 30 counties have reported major flooding. Although the sky has cleared in recent days, mountain floods continue to erupt unabated, and the water level has not decreased slightly. In addition, the water level of the Yangtze River has increased, and the water of the Xiang and Yuan Rivers cannot be discharged, causing the Yangtze River to backflow into the lake. As a result, the counties along the lake have suffered particularly heavy losses. The provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Relief Committee have dispatched special commissioners to separately expedite the inspection of dikes, supervise flood control, and prepare for relief efforts. However, the water level continues to rise, and the disaster is expanding daily, which is very worrying. The following is a summary of the disaster reports from various counties in recent days.</p>
<h3>Changde Dikes and Embankments Collapse</h3>
<p>Zhou Shuzi, the Supervisor of Changde and Han, telegraphed the province, reporting: "Due to continuous heavy rain in Changde recently, the river water has risen sharply, more than two feet higher than the water level in the 20th year of the Republic.

The lake water is higher than the embankment fields, and the accumulated water cannot be discharged. About 60% of the embankment fields have been submerged by the water. If the rain continues, the embankments will become a swamp. Although the embankment works are solid, if the lake water rises another three or four feet, there is a risk of collapse. I have ordered the district chiefs and embankment leaders to take strict precautions and report at any time. I respectfully report this by telegram for your review. Magistrate Hou Houzong of Yueyang County presents this report."</p>
<h3>Yiyang Two Embankments Collapse</h3>
<p>The magistrate of Yiyang County reported, "The subordinate county is located in the lower reaches of the Zi River, bordering the lake. The districts in the lower township are all embankment fields. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been overcast and cold, with continuous rain for weeks. The Zi River has flooded several times. The Tongyou Embankment and Dongbai Embankment in the county's second district have both reported disasters due to water accumulation, and the rice seedlings have been submerged. Qianjiazhou, Yanjiabao Embankment, Yiyuan 16 Embankment, and others in the seventh district have also suffered disasters due to water accumulation. The Yongxing and Liang Embankments collapsed at 4 a.m. on the 16th of this month. In addition to dispatching personnel to investigate, I have also ordered the district chiefs to supervise the embankment leaders to prepare for defense and expedite rescue efforts. I have also dispatched capable political police to various embankments to suppress and assist, doing my best to protect them. Although the Zi River has receded slightly, the Yuan and Li Rivers have flooded at the same time, and the various embankments are still at risk. I hereby report the collapse of the embankments and the protection of the water situation by telegram. Magistrate Li Yu of Yiyang County kowtows."</p>

<p>The magistrate of Li County reported, "In the past month, heavy rains have continued, and the embankments in the county have suffered internal collapses. On the days of Hanqiao, there were two mountain floods, and the water rose several zhang, endangering the county seat. More than ten embankments have collapsed, and people, livestock, and property have been washed away, which is extremely tragic. In addition to submitting a detailed report, I first report this by telegram. Magistrate Gui Tang of Li County and Director Wen Yun of the Provincial Tax Bureau kowtow." Another telegram said, "The telegram respectfully awaits your review. According to reports, Mengjiang Embankment and 35 other embankments collapsed on the evening of Hanqiao.

<h3>Liuyang Corpses Float By</h3>
<p>Mountain floods erupted in Liuyang, and the city and countryside suffered severe flooding. Yin Zhongcai, the magistrate of the county, has reported this to the province. The Langli River in Changsha flows through Liuyang. On the 18th, the corps commander of the city reported to the city that more than a dozen male and female corpses had floated in the river in recent days. Furthermore, a dead woman was seen holding the corpse of her baby, only a few months old, in her arms, not letting go. It can be seen that the water came suddenly, and there was no time to escape. The corpses that have floated in have been buried by the local authorities. In addition, an old Wujiang boat was moored on the riverbank in the city. There were five men and women on board. Due to the surge of the Liuyang River flood, it was suddenly overturned. It was late at night, and the entire boat capsized, burying everyone in the fish's belly, which is truly tragic.</p>

In addition to ordering the affected companies to add water equipment, strengthen flood prevention, and find ways to provide relief to unemployed workers, I hereby report the disaster by telegram for your review. I respectfully request prompt relief and await your orders. Town Director Yang Tonggeng of the Xinhua Mine Mountain Directly Subordinate Town Office, Chairman Wang Zicai of the Xinhua Antimony Industry Association, and Chairman Yang Zhiduan of the Xinhua Tin Mine Mountain Antimony Mine Industry Workers' Union kowtow.</p>

<p>Robbery and Assault in Shangyu Lane</p>
<p>Xia Ailin, a 48-year-old resident of Shangyu Lane in the fourth district (Kaiyuan Township) of the county, is a stone paving worker by profession. He has some savings and has two young sons. At around 10 p.m. on the night of the 29th, seven bandits came, wearing short blue cloth shirts and pants, and carrying two pistols. Four bandits climbed over the roof from the low houses next door and entered the courtyard, opening the gate. Three bandits were on guard outside, and set off firecrackers to show their power. After entering the room, the bandits shone flashlights and crowded upstairs, dragging Xia Ailin and his wife from the bed and forcing them to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Xia's wife replied that it was too late, and was hit with a wooden stick by the bandits. They then searched separately and robbed more than 90 silver dollars and about 100 copper coins from the bed. They also robbed a gold ring, two gold bracelets, three silver rings, and leather clothing, for a total loss of more than 200 yuan. After the bandits obtained the loot, they divided it in Qingshan Bay, leaving behind a clothing bag containing shrouds and other items. The next day, it was picked up by the villagers and returned to Xia's family. Liu Chunlan, the director of the 9th branch of the public security bureau in charge, immediately sent Patrol Chief Feng to lead the police to investigate and investigate the location where the bandits divided the spoils. On one hand, the victim Xia Ailin issued a loss report and reported to the public security bureau to request the arrest of the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Gold Lion and Jade Inkstone Discovered in Tianzhong</h3>
<p>Dan A'genhe, a farmer in Qian Chen Lane, Baitu Township, Second District (i.e., Wang Aisheng), is over 30 years old and has three children. However, his family is destitute. This spring, through Wang Agui, he rented a mu of rice field from Zhao Qiu, a Chinese medicine practitioner in Baituqiao, for cultivation. A'genhe had already harvested the wheat in the field and was preparing to irrigate the water for rice planting. Suddenly, he discovered two urn heads in the mud in the eastern corner of the field, containing a gold lion, an jade inkstone, and two gold bars weighing more than 17 taels in total. In addition, there were 16 silver ingots with a wire plate style, each weighing five taels. A'genhe was overjoyed and put them on the table at home for the family to worship. Neighboring villagers who heard the news went to see them, and the road became blocked. Now, a jade shop in Suzhou is willing to pay 3,500 yuan to buy the gold lion and jade inkstone.

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Flight School Captain Falls and Dies</p>
<p>Chen Huifu, the captain of the cover team of the Central Aviation School in Jianqiao, Hangzhou, took a car to Qiaosi on official business a few days ago. Because the truck he was sitting in was bumping, he fell, causing serious head injuries to Captain Chen. Blood flowed like a fountain, and he was immediately sent to Guangji Hospital for treatment. He died at 8 a.m. yesterday morning. The school notified Captain Chen's family from his native place (Haining) to come to Hangzhou to take care of the funeral. All the students and officers of the school mourned him.</p>
<h3>Tragic Murder of a Farmhand Occurs in West Lake</h3>
<p>Qi Zhongbao, a 69-year-old farmer from Caoshe No. 6, Kuoshi Banqiao, West Lake, Hangzhou, is a native of the mountains and usually grows vegetables there. His wife, Qi Xushi, is 54 years old. He has a son and a daughter. Yu A'mao, who is 30 years old, also farms at home. The daughter, Xu Qishi, who is 27 years old, is somewhat attractive. She married Xu Kaitai, a gardener, and lives at No. 11 Renhe Road, Hangzhou City. Because her mother's house is close by, she often goes home. In the 17th year of the Republic, she had an affair with Monk Xinkong, who used to live in the Golden Cave and now lives in the Liutong Temple. On the tenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, Xu Qishi and Xinkong were having illicit relations when they were seen by the farmhand Shen A'fa. Qi Zhongbao was afraid of being exposed, which would affect his face, so he struck first and tragically killed Shen A'fa with a kitchen knife, stabbing him thirteen times and killing him. At about 9 p.m. that night, Qi and another short-term worker, Qi Demao, carried the corpse to the foot of the vegetable garden wall opposite and buried it to cover up the traces. On the afternoon of the 29th, Qi Demao was discussing the report with his fellow villagers in a teahouse in the bustling city when he was overheard by a bystander, who immediately reported it to Patrol Chief Chen Peijin of the sixth sub-bureau of the second district, who went to find Qi Demao. After detailed questioning, Qi revealed everything. Inspector Sun Hengji was sent to lead Demao to identify the burial site at night, and the corpse was found buried there. The police immediately arrested Qi Zhongbao and others and confiscated the murder weapon. Xinkong was also arrested. The confessions of the criminals were evasive, and they claimed that they were arguing with Qi Demao and were killed. However, Qi Xushi has admitted that the deceased was killed by her husband. The main culprit could not deny it. At 1 p.m. yesterday (30th), the Hangzhou Local Court sent Prosecutor Chen Huaming and Clerk Feng Shengxiang to examine the body, and it was confirmed that there were thirteen knife wounds on the throat, causing death. The corpse was moved to the Qingbomen Cemetery in a coffin. The six murderers were handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Cooperative Movement</p>
<h3>The Way Out for China's Cooperative Movement by Wu Juenong</h3>
<p>What is the goal of the cooperative movement? Thirty years ago, Dr. Hans Hullor made it clear at the Sixth International Cooperative Alliance Congress: "This is a movement for us to strive for independence and freedom in our economic and social living conditions." Although it was opposed at the time by a small group of those who believed in Christian-style "You must love your neighbor," his judgment has become increasingly meaningful and powerful as time goes on!</p>
<p>Since 1844, about ninety years ago, when the Rochdale Pioneers Cooperative Society in England was established, cooperative societies now exist almost everywhere humans live, and the number of people worldwide who have joined cooperative societies accounts for more than one-fifth of the total population. Indeed, because it is a movement that peacefully strives for economic and social independence and freedom, it does not provoke strong opposition from capitalism.</p>
<p>However, despite this, while we see the cooperative movement developing in this way, on the other hand, various countries differ in their circumstances, content, and methods. Consumer cooperative societies in England have special prosperity, credit cooperative societies have meaningful development in Germany, France focuses on production cooperation, Belgium develops insurance cooperation, and Denmark focuses on sales cooperation for milk and eggs. These are still formal distinctions, the most different being that the development of the cooperative movement in Europe is from the bottom up, in other words, it is an organization automatically formed by the people. In the East, such as Japan and India, most are from the top down, that is, the government makes every effort to promote and guide them. Furthermore, Russia uses the methods of the cooperative movement to complete its socialist foundation, while Belgium uses it as a weapon of the Socialist Party. Pan-Germanists in Italy and recently in Germany are even using coercion and enticement to try to make cooperative organizations part of their operational structure. Therefore, although the cooperative movement permeates the entire world, its methods vary; although cooperativists argue vehemently over various theories, in reality, they have long established their own separate approaches based on the political organization and social environment of each country.</p>
<p>China's cooperative movement has only a little over ten years of history, its foundation is extremely weak, and its achievements are naturally very immature. In recent years, due to the impending bankruptcy of rural villages and considerable promotion by the government, it seems to have made some progress, but the cooperative movements in various countries arise with the development of capitalism. China's national capital is still very weak, and urban financial capital is also abnormally and temporarily concentrated in cities due to the current unrest in the interior. In other words, China's current situation is completely under the control of imperialist financial capitalists, and the so-called domestic financial capital is merely an appendage of international capitalism. Therefore, China's cooperative movement definitely cannot arbitrarily copy and agree with the practices of other countries. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Let's take a few facts as examples. Recently, most cooperative comrades have said that there is no hope for the development of consumer cooperation in China, and that attention should be paid to agricultural cooperation in the future. Why can't consumer cooperation develop in China? The fact is that the majority of China's population are farmers. They wear simple clothes and eat coarse food, and are originally in a state of self-sufficiency, but now, after decades of exploitation by imperialists and feudal toxins, they are all in a state of semi-starvation, and there is almost no so-called consumption to speak of. Consumers are only residents in cities. A portion of city residents are non-productive consumers, they have free time and surplus cash, and they "don't care" about buying expensive goods. Moreover, there are various tax-evading and smuggling goods in cities, and there are bargain sales of cheap goods from various countries. With low prices and good quality, there is naturally no need to organize consumer cooperative societies. Others are non-resident employees, small merchants, vagrants, and workers. Firstly, they lack the ideology of anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism; secondly, they also lack the concept of unity and savings; and thirdly, and more importantly, they are accustomed to living under a feudal social organization, relying entirely on buying and selling on credit to eke out their years. Therefore, the simplest slogans of consumer cooperation: "Consumption is savings" and "Purchase must be in cash" are ultimately incompatible.</p>
<p>But is there hope for agricultural cooperation? If we cannot identify goals and establish a comprehensive plan, I predict that there will be no good results.</p>
<p>The most important and original organization of agricultural cooperation is credit cooperation. The first goal of credit cooperation is the self-savings of members, and the second is to borrow money from outside the society based on the credit of the entire society. China's farmers are already so poor that most of them are in debt. How can we talk about savings? As for borrowing money from outside the society, high-interest loans are of course excluded, and at present, rural banks and loan offices in various places not only have weak funds and difficult distribution, but also the interest of about one percent and short-term loans of half a year to a year, will they truly remedy the farmers' situation? I'm afraid no one can give me a satisfactory answer. Although recent financial capital has intentions to invest in rural areas, whether it has the strength has become a question, and whether it can truly benefit the farmers has become an important question for those who discuss the rural economy.</p>
<p>Let's talk about production and sales cooperation: The current commercial organization is extremely complex. If farmers can cooperate and sell directly on their own, they can naturally eliminate the profits of some small merchants, but the final handling institutions are still in the hands of foreign merchants and large factories in big cities. If their exploitative relationship is not eliminated, there is no hope of profiting from the trade of agricultural products. In recent years, the large-scale imports of rice, wheat, and cotton have left producers in the interior with no hope of survival, and what's more, the prices of all agricultural products are originally below the necessary production costs. Recently, cooperativists in various countries have been striving to directly link production cooperation with consumer cooperation, the purpose of which is to do just this, and since China's consumer cooperation is so immature and has so little hope, the lack of hope for production cooperation and even production and sales cooperation is also conceivable.</p>
<p>So, how should China's cooperative movement seek a path to survival? Here, limited by space, let's briefly list a few outlines:</p>
<p>First, the government should use all its strength. For example, in terms of finance, there must be at least three to five hundred million in working capital to provide loans to credit cooperative societies at the lowest interest rate. Second, regarding all production, sales, and farmers' distribution and consumption, it should be under the control of the government and be the organization for all activities. Third, the goal of organizing various cooperative societies is not only economic transformation, but must also bear the responsibility of social transformation, internally to eliminate all feudal forces, and externally to resist international imperialism. Fourth, this cooperative organization will naturally be from the top down, and should also have a degree of compulsion.</p>
<p>This was originally not my personal observation. Last year, many cooperative experts from the China Cooperative Society had such important resolutions in their plans to prosper rural areas through cooperative methods. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity of holding a cooperative propaganda movement, I will further elaborate on it.</p>
<h3>One of the Most Important Pages in the History of the Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>The annual meeting of the China Cooperative Society in October of last year passed the "Plan to Prosper Rural Areas Through Cooperative Methods. This is one of the most important pages in the history of the Chinese Cooperative Movement." The article is tens of thousands of words long, and due to space limitations, it cannot be published in its entirety. Only an outline of the plan is recorded here to give a glimpse of the whole picture. Readers who want to see the whole picture should consult the report of the Third General Meeting of Members of the Society.</p>

<h3>Recent European Cooperative Movement by Peng Shiqin</h3>
<p>For this International Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week, the editor assigned me this topic because I had just returned from Europe to study cooperative undertakings. Due to space and time constraints, I can only give a general overview.</p>
<p>The trends of the European cooperative movement, to name a few major ones, are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Integration and unification. The establishment of European cooperative societies is all from the bottom up. The poor classes, due to practical needs, unite people in similar circumstances and organize a cooperative society. At the beginning of their establishment, the scale was very small. For example, consumer cooperative societies are only for eliminating the exploitation of retail merchants and grocery stores. This was still able to deal with the enemy in the early days of the cooperative movement. By the end of the nineteenth century, the situation had changed greatly. These small-scale cooperative societies gradually felt that it was not easy to survive. After the war, due to the progress of commercial organizations, it was even more precarious. To save themselves, they had to unite and increase their own strength. Thus, the idea of ​​mergers spread throughout Europe. At this time, it was only the integration of small cooperative societies with the same purpose in the same region, which was a defensive front. Recently, those in charge of cooperative central organizations in various countries have wanted to unite cooperative societies of the same nature in one country under a consistent system from top to bottom, as a prerequisite for the second to fourth items to be discussed below, to prepare to counterattack the enemy and transform the lineup.</p>
<p>The work of integration is still in progress today. Looking at recent statistics, whether it is consumer cooperative societies, production cooperative societies, or credit cooperative societies, especially German agricultural credit cooperative societies, although the number of newly established societies is more than the number of bankrupt societies, the total number is often slightly less than in previous years. This is precisely the result of integration. As for unification, it is more difficult to achieve than integration. This is not only affected by the religious or political colors of cooperative societies, but also by the stubbornness of a group of founders. We have already seen that cooperative societies are very small in scale at the beginning of their establishment. However, if they are managed properly and have a long history, they can often develop to a considerable important position. The founders of these cooperative societies that have reached a considerable important position often pride themselves on this and are unwilling to make themselves subordinate to others. It is possible to join a wholesale cooperative society as a member, but they are ultimately unwilling to sacrifice their independent facade. This phenomenon is still easy to encounter in Belgium, but it is gradually getting better.</p>
<p>(2) Link between production cooperation and consumer cooperation. Before consumer cooperative societies expand to their own production, all consumer goods must be purchased from abroad: either from capitalist producers or from production cooperative societies. However, whether it is from the former or the latter, conflicts of interest between each consumer society and the price are inevitable. Let's not mention capitalist producers for the time being; Professor Gide has described the relationship between production cooperative societies and consumer cooperative societies very accurately in one of his books. Although production cooperative societies are not for profit, they only take back the part that is devoured by middlemen, because they believe that this is the part of their products that is exploited. However, consumer cooperative societies believe that this is the part that is exploited when they purchase, and they also demand to take back the whole part. Therefore, when these two types of cooperative societies trade, they do not give way to each other, so that they cannot get close. At the same time, capitalist producers and middlemen reap the benefits. Recently, both sides have realized that this phenomenon is a major obstacle to the future of the cooperative movement. If so, the saying that consumer cooperative societies and production cooperative societies, especially consumer cooperative societies and agricultural cooperative societies, should be linked has become increasingly popular. National cooperative congresses and the International Cooperative Alliance in various countries all recognize this as a major current issue. Before the emergence of the cooperative republic and before the abolition of the wage system, this relationship is to organize the economy nationally and internationally under conditions that meet needs. Moreover, the need for consumer cooperative societies and agricultural cooperative societies to be linked is especially emphasized by the promoters of the cooperative movement in various countries. Because agricultural cooperative societies directly operated by farmers are often better in terms of technology and production than agricultural cooperative societies operated by urban consumers. Therefore, in recent years, there have been increasing reports of consumer cooperative societies and agricultural cooperative societies establishing letters of understanding and transaction contracts. Moreover, consumers have incorporated the established agricultural production organizations into agricultural cooperative societies, eliminating the past competition and jealousy. The consumer cooperative in Geneva, Switzerland, abandoned its own milk business and is entirely supplied by the Geneva Milk Cooperative, which is a clear example.</p>
<p>(3) Progress of wholesale cooperation. Under the concentrated phenomenon of modern capitalism, the elimination of small enterprises by large enterprises is a natural result. This is especially evident in industry and commerce. The reason why small handicraftsmen can still survive is that artistic products cannot be made by machines. The reason why retailers can still maintain themselves is that the credit system is not popular in capitalist large stores on the one hand, and is not allowed by cooperative principles on the other hand. At the current stage, since cooperative societies are unable to produce on their own and directly supply wholesale cooperative societies, the application of wholesale cooperation is not only the only way to reduce the cost of purchasing goods, but also an important condition for being able to maintain themselves undefeated against all private businesses. Although this principle has long been worked hard for by cooperativists, it has not been fully realized according to the planned plan due to various reasons. In some countries, they are still in the era of simple wholesale places, without warehouse equipment, and only representatives of secondary cooperative societies from various places gather at the wholesale place once a week to collect order documents and transfer them to suppliers to directly ship to various places.

<h3>Guerrilla Army Attacks Yingkou</h3>
<p>Heavy Losses for the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Yingkou is an important port in the Northeast. A large amount of soybeans, soybean cakes, soybean oil, etc., are shipped every year. After the puppet state forcibly occupied the customs and arbitrarily increased tariffs, the South China gangs stopped handling goods to Yingkou completely. Business in the Niuzhuang area has declined to the extreme. This time, the "Tunan" ship of the China Merchants Bureau arrived in Yingkou, just in time for the guerrilla army to attack Yingkou. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Army Attacks</h3>
<p>The "Tunan" ship arrived in Yingkou on June 24, having sailed from Shanghai. On the day before the ship arrived in Yingkou, a large force of the guerrilla army attacked Yingkou again. The guerrillas' purpose was initially not to occupy Yingkou, but to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese army. When the guerrillas attacked to within 14 miles of Yingkou, the Yingkou market had already experienced extreme panic. The Japanese army hurriedly set off and fought with the guerrillas near Yingkou. As a result, five Japanese officers were killed and many soldiers were injured, while the guerrillas also withdrew.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Deaths</h3>
<p>From the 24th onwards, the Japanese army declared martial law in Yingkou. Armed military police were stationed on the streets, and traffic was cut off at 8:00 p.m. Unless there were special symbols and passwords, passage was not allowed. The search of people from outside was even stricter, so that after sunset, there was no one on the streets. On the day the "Tunan" ship arrived in Yingkou, the Japanese army stationed in Yingkou held a memorial service for the five Japanese officers who had been killed by the guerrillas, and sent the bones of the deceased to Dalian for transportation back to Japan.</p>
<h3>All Industries Depressed</h3>
<p>Yingkou's major products, such as soybean cakes, oil, and miscellaneous grains, are mostly sold to Shantou, Xiamen, Guangdong, and other ports. Recently, due to the puppet state's increase in export taxes, the South China gangs have implemented a cessation of procurement. The special commissioners sent by Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong to handle goods have all withdrawn, and the silk and satin merchants and southern goods stores operated by Guangdong people in Yingkou are also closing down and returning south, causing the Yingkou market to be depressed in all industries. State-owned ships occasionally sail to Yingkou, mostly empty, and freight rates have fallen sharply. There is no cargo to carry. This time, the "Tunan" waited for many days, but only managed to load several thousand soybean cakes. At present, the Yingkou branch bureaus have all telegraphed to Shanghai, stating that business is in extreme decline and requesting that fewer ships be sent to avoid losses from empty voyages.</p>
<h3>Navigation Measurement Bureau Notice: Riverboats Slow Down</h3>
<p>Protect the Levee</p>
<p>The Navigation Measurement Bureau of the Navy Department, in view of the recent rise in river water, especially in the section from Jiujiang to Hankou, and in view of the possibility that the newly built levees on both sides of the river may not be strong and may collapse, specially issued a notice to the navigation industry yesterday that all large and small ships passing through low-lying areas along the river must slow down and stay away from the levees, so that they will not be destroyed by the torrents. This warning is intended to protect the lives and property of residents along the river, so all large and small ships must absolutely comply with it when sailing in that area.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Held a Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Aircraft Test Flight in the City Sky Today</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation held its 20th shareholders' meeting yesterday to discuss the Shanghai-Guangdong flight and other issues. It did not adjourn until around 5:00 p.m. As for the new Sikorsky aircraft purchased by the company, one has been assembled yesterday, and it is planned to conduct a test flight in the city sky today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting: China National Aviation Corporation held its 20th shareholders' meeting at the company's board room yesterday afternoon from 4:00 p.m. Attendees included Chinese and American shareholders Huang Jiangquan, Huang Xianhua, Tang Baoshu, Dai Enji, Bishi Bi, Pang De, Bolin, etc. Report items: (1) This year's business situation, (2) Preparations for the Shanghai-Guangdong line. Discussion items: (1) Date of the Shanghai-Guangdong line test flight and opening, (2) Year-end salary increase for employees, totaling approximately 800 dollars, (3) Half-day holiday on Saturdays in July and August, and other motions.</p>
<p>New Aircraft Test Flight: The two twin-engine Sikorsky aircraft newly purchased by the company from the United States were transported to the Longhua airfield for assembly after arriving in Shanghai. One has been assembled yesterday, and its appearance is very beautiful. It has about ten passenger seats, and can carry twelve people including the pilot. The aircraft is scheduled to conduct a test flight in the urban area today. In addition, another aircraft is also being assembled quickly.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Company in the Area of Cross-Border Road Construction</p>
<h3>Automatic Telephone Installation Completed</h3>
<p>Automatic Connection from Midnight Tonight</p>
<p>Company's Operating Report for Last Year</p>
<p>After the temporary resolution of the Shanghai Telephone Company's issue of cross-border road construction, it immediately replaced the telephones in the area of cross-border road construction in the northern district with fully automatic telephones. The project has now been completed and is scheduled to be fully converted to automatic connection from midnight tonight. According to the northern district's cross-border road construction area telephones, since the northern district automatic connection room was put into operation in February last year, all calls to that area have been automatically connected. However, outgoing calls still used manual connection, with operators dialing the listed numbers in the northern district connection room on behalf of the users. Now, it has been changed to automatic connection, completely the same as telephones in other areas. The company released its operating report and financial summary for last year, with total revenue of 3,500,450 taels for the entire year, an increase of 1,083,929 taels compared to the previous year. Various expenses, including depreciation, totaled 2,282,796 taels, an increase of 161,152 taels compared to the previous year. However, after deducting various interest charges, the company's operating loss was still 71,372 taels, which was less than the loss of 107,237 taels in the previous year. This loss was largely due to increased expenses during the period of converting to automatic telephones. As for the number of users, there were 44,606 at the end of last year, an increase of 6,177 compared to the end of the previous year, approximately 16 percent. Since the introduction of automatic telephones last autumn, the number of calls made by each user has increased rapidly. In the past year, the number of calls made per day has more than doubled compared to before. Therefore, although the telephone fee increased in March last year, the average cost per call for users has decreased by 24 percent compared to the time of manual connection.</p>
<h3>Li Du's Representatives Go to Hong Kong Today to Welcome Li</h3>
<p>General Li Du took the Italian postal ship "Conte Verde" on the 14th of last month to return to China, and is expected to pass through Hong Kong on the 6th and arrive in Shanghai on the 8th. General Li's representatives in Shanghai, Liu Piguang, Li's adjutant Wang Ziyao, and Counselor Jiang Ying, will take the "Sabrogan" ship to Hong Kong today to welcome General Li. Wang Ziyao was originally scheduled to fly to Xinjiang the day before yesterday to inspect the troops stationed in Xinjiang on behalf of General Li. However, because General Li's return to China was imminent, he decided to meet with General Li for instructions before setting off. Liu and Wang went to the Municipal Government yesterday to request protection when General Li arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>China-England Corporation Writes to Two Railway Bureaus</h3>
<p>Regarding the Arrangement and Payment of Overdue Loan Interest</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Replies That It Saves 7,000 Yuan Monthly</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the China-England Bank Corporation stated that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations have repeatedly declared their inability to pay the principal and interest on overdue loans, while the railway lines have not increased, and the number of staff has increased year by year. Therefore, on the 15th of last month, it sent a letter to the heads of the two railway bureaus, urging them to consider the matter and restore the financial stability of the two railways to its previous level. The following is a record of the correspondence:</p>
<p>Letter of Request for Consideration</p>
<p>To Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu:</p>
<p>We are grateful to receive your letter of May 11, together with a copy of the first quarter work summary for the 22nd year of your bureau. Mr. Pousset has already read this report with great interest, and we understand that you consider the economy to be the lifeblood of the railway and regard it as the most important thing. This coincides with our own view. We also learned that your bureau has implemented frugality in stationery and materials, and has strictly restricted free tickets and benefit tickets, which is admirable. However, in general, it seems that your bureau's internal division of labor is in danger of being excessively detailed. Therefore, there are inevitably too many staff employed. This can be verified by looking at the number of staff in the Railway Statistics published by the Ministry of Railways. Although this did not start after you took office, it may be helpful to compare the number of staff over the years. The annual number of employees for both of your railways is as follows: 1916: 7,251; 1920: 8,564; 1923: 10,009; 1926: 10,639; 1929: 12,183; 1930: 12,505; 1931: 12,885; 1932: 13,071; 1933: 12,199.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the rate of increase in your bureau's employees is very large. Although the railway business is said to be prospering year by year, the railway lines of your two railways have not increased. Although a connecting line was once added, after the connecting line was completed, your two railway bureaus merged into one and jointly managed the business, which in theory should have saved even more money. We sincerely hope that you will consider this issue and restore the financial stability of the two railways to its previous level. This is our earnest hope, and we look forward to seeing its realization. From a public point of view, it is generally believed that the railway's ability to repay its debts is a model of management performance. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway has repeatedly stated that it is unable to repay the overdue loans, and those who hold the bonds believe that the railway's reputation is now such that they are sending letters to newspapers to express their dissatisfaction. This shows the extent of public indignation. Now that the railway is fortunate to have you working hard to rectify it, it should be able to arrange for the payment of one installment of interest on the overdue debt in the shortest possible time, so that those who invested in the Chinese railway in the past can alleviate their anxiety. With this special letter, we offer our best wishes.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Pousset</p>
<p>Railway Bureau's Explanation</p>
<p>To Mr. Pousset:</p>
<p>We are grateful to receive your letter of May 15, in which you mentioned that the number of employees on both railways has increased year by year, and that the principal and interest on the loans have been delayed for a long time, and urged us to consider the matter. Since we, Boqiao and others, have taken charge of the two railways, our only focus has been on economizing on unnecessary expenses, while focusing our efforts on productive undertakings. It is only when business increases that the principal and interest on the loans can be paid on time. As for the increase in personnel, it has been found that the five departments of the bureau—General Affairs, Engineering, Mechanical Affairs, Accounting, and Materials—have actually decreased rather than increased compared to last year. However, the Transportation Department has had to moderately add the lowest-level employees as assistants in order to handle responsible transportation. However, this was approved by the Ministry of Railways in advance, and was not initiated after Boqiao and others took office. In addition, the police department has added police officers because the police force on the two railways is weak, and it is necessary to add police officers at the time of responsible transportation. Most of the authority to employ people is controlled by the Railway Police Administration. Therefore, the number of people in the Transportation Department and the Police Department has slightly increased, but in terms of salaries, it has actually saved 7,092 yuan per month. We have enclosed a comparison table for your review. We hope that you will give us your advice from time to time so that we can correct our shortcomings. We are very grateful. We wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao and Wu Shaozeng</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Convening his Subordinates to Discuss Relief for Refugees and Officers</p>
<p>Receiving Reporters at 10:00 AM This Morning to Report on Everything</p>
<p>Various Organizations Held a Meeting Yesterday to Prepare a Grand Welcome</p>
<p>Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen, the newly appointed members of the Military Affairs Commission, went to Beijing and then to Jiangxi from Shanghai to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the anti-Japanese war and ask for instructions on everything. Now that they have completed their official duties, they returned from Jiangxi with their entourage of about a dozen people, taking the Jardine Matheson's De He steamer and the Taikoo Company's Wuhu steamer. They arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 28th. Mr. Ma and Mr. Su disembarked together, and Mr. Su immediately transferred to the early express train to Shanghai and Hangzhou to visit his wife and daughters. Mr. Ma took the train to Shanghai from Beijing on the afternoon of the 27th at 5:25 PM and arrived in port at 12:25 AM yesterday morning. His whereabouts were extremely secret, and he is scheduled to receive reporters at 10:00 AM this morning to report on all matters, which will be recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Very Few Knew</h3>
<p>Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen returned to the country in early June and went to Beijing and then to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the anti-Japanese war. They stayed in Nanchang for seven days and in Lushan for eleven days, and then, together with Lang Guanpu, the acting chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and others, took the Jardine Matheson's De He steamer and the Taikoo Company's Wuhu steamer eastward. They arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 28th. Mr. Ma and Mr. Su disembarked together, and the rest of the entourage took the original steamer to Shanghai, arriving in port on the morning of the 27th. Mr. Su immediately transferred to the early express train to Shanghai and Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 27th to visit his wife and sons. General Ma arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 12:25 AM yesterday morning. The matter was kept strictly confidential in advance. At that time, apart from Zhang Dianjiu, the deputy commander of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army, and three or five others who remained in Shanghai, very few outsiders knew about it.</p>
<h3>Visited General Zhu</h3>
<p>After arriving in port, Mr. Ma went directly to his son Ma Kui's private residence in Sande Lane, Luban Road, to rest. However, because he was tired from the journey, he felt a slight headache and eye problems after arriving in port yesterday morning. He then went to a doctor's office with Deputy Commander Zhang Dianjiu for a consultation, and then went to visit General Zhu Ziqiao to discuss the placement of his subordinates. Mr. Ma is scheduled to receive the Shanghai press at the Huizhong Hotel on Sanma Road at 10:00 AM today (the 1st) to discuss everything in detail.</p>
<h3>Discussing Relief</h3>
<p>There are many Northeastern refugees who have returned to the country this time, most of whom are family members of those who died in battle. There are about 400 people in Beiping and about 200 in Shanghai. There are also about 200 family members of military officers, for a total of about 800 people. Some are stationed in Xinjiang, displaced and in dire straits. Representatives from Beiping also came to Shanghai yesterday to appeal for help. Mr. Ma immediately sent people to handle the matter. The various charitable organizations in Shanghai are maintaining their food and lodging, which is only a temporary measure. In order to seek fundamental relief, Mr. Ma specially invited Zhang Dianjiu, Lang Guanpu, and senior officials such as Liang Zhenduo and Xu Jingde yesterday morning to discuss ways to relieve the refugees.</p>
<h3>Meeting Subordinates</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma had planned to inspect the Jiangwan and Wusong war zones in Zhabei yesterday morning, but he was unable to do so due to the meeting. In the afternoon, his subordinates, including Zhang Dianjiu, the deputy commander of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, Xu Jingde, the commander of the Heihe garrison, Zhou Weitai, the director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Industry Department, Lang Guanpu, the director of the Finance Department, Wang Erzhan, the deputy commander of the Hulunbuir Railway Protection Army, Wu Delin, the commander of the Second Brigade, and Duan Zhongshang and Wu Huanzhang, Mr. Ma's representatives in Ping and Shanghai, were all received and interviewed by Mr. Ma. General Ma was unwell due to the fatigue of the journey and suffered from a severe headache. He plans to be hospitalized for treatment and recuperation within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Personnel Arriving Together</h3>
<p>Those who accompanied General Ma to Shanghai this time include Lang Guanpu, the director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government's Finance Department, Zhou Weigong, the director of the Industry Department, Ke Yin, the secretary, Li Nongjun, Guo Zhushu, the director of the secretariat of the Su Department, and Deputy Adjutant Zhang, and more than a dozen others. They are currently staying at the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lang's Talk</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Lang Guanpu at the Huizhong Hotel to inquire about everything. Mr. Lang replied that General Ma and others had completed their official duties in Jiangxi and took the Jardine Matheson's De He steamer eastward a few days ago. When the steamer arrived at Xiaguan, Mr. Ma and Deputy Adjutant Zhang disembarked and transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai United Transport to Shanghai. He (Mr. Lang) continued to take the original steamer and arrived in Shanghai the other day. When Mr. Ma came to Shanghai from Beijing this time, he was afraid that people from all walks of life in the city would come to welcome him, so he did not dare to bother them. Therefore, he did not telegraph in advance, so very few outsiders knew about it. Mr. Ma's most important task in leaving Jiangxi and sweeping Shanghai this time is to deal with the aftermath of his subordinates. Since Generals Ma and Su returned to the country, a total of about forty or fifty people from Mr. Ma's side and about seventy or eighty people from Mr. Su's side have come to Shanghai and are now staying in Shanghai waiting to be placed. As for the troops in Heilongjiang Province, they are currently led jointly by Division Commander Deng Wen, Independent Brigade Commander Li Haiqing, and Regiment Commander Tang. Mr. Ma plans to stay in Shanghai for a long time to recuperate.</p>
<h3>Preparing a Welcome</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Organizations' Preparatory Committee for Welcoming the Anti-Japanese Heroes Generals Ma and Su held a preparatory committee meeting at the committee's office at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those who attended the meeting included Shen Tianxin, Chen Yafu, Fang Difei, Sun Mingqi, Wang Jian'e, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Ye Jiaxing, Liu Zhongying, Zheng Dongshan, Liang Gengshun, Zhang Chiseng, Ge Futian, and more than a dozen others. The meeting was chaired by Shen Tianxin. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Shen Tianxin and Wang Honghui were appointed to meet with General Ma Zhanshan in person; (2) A welcome meeting will be held on a fixed date after the meeting; (3) Another meeting will be held at 2:00 PM tomorrow afternoon to discuss the details. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Su Will Return to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>General Su Bingwen previously sent Representative Fan Ruizheng to Shanghai to express his condolences to the families of the officers and soldiers who remained in Shanghai. Mr. Fan returned to Hangzhou yesterday to report back. According to Mr. Fan, General Su will come to Shanghai soon to take care of everything. As for the date of Commander Zhang Dianjiu's trip to the north, it is not yet certain. It is expected that it will be determined after meeting with General Su in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee of Benevolent Organizations</h3>
<p>The Joint Relief Association of Charitable Organizations for Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from Xu Shiying from Lushan, reporting on the meeting with Generals Ma and Su to discuss ways to relieve Northeastern refugees. Ma and Su agreed to join the association and go to Nanyang to raise relief funds. The association issued a notice yesterday, stating that a meeting will be held at the Renji Hall at 4:00 PM tomorrow to elect Ma and Su as standing committee members of the association. Xu's original telegram read: (Omissions) The report on Yangri's fundraising advertisement is extremely admirable. Your brother has been with Generals Ma Xiufang and Su Hanzhang in the mountains for days, and he knows that they are concerned about the Northeastern refugees and are willing to work with people from all walks of life to raise relief funds. At that time, I persuaded them to join the Standing Committee of this Association, and they all agreed. I also asked them to go to Nanyang to raise relief funds. The two generals are loyal, benevolent, and eager to help those in need. It is proposed that this association hold a special meeting to elect the two generals Ma and Su as standing committee members, which will definitely benefit the future of relief work. How can we expect a reply? Shiying bows, Qin.</p>
<h3>Six Shipping Companies Suspend Sailings and Reduce Flights</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented Starting Today</p>
<p>The Yangtze River shipping industry is in decline, and the various shipping companies have held meetings to implement austerity measures and reduce flights in order to minimize losses. The news was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a continuation of the news:</p>
<h3>Number of Ships of Six Major Companies</h3>
<p>On the Yangtze River route, the six companies with the largest business in Shanghai are Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin, China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ningshao. Taikoo Company has ten Yangtze River ships, such as the Huangpu, Wuchang, Wenzhou, Wusong, Wuxue, Wuhu, Changsha, Poyang, Datong, and Anqing, which run 26 to 27 flights per month. Jardine Matheson has eight ships, such as the Gonghe, Dehe, Jihe, Pinghe, Lianhe, and Xianghe, which run 20 to 21 flights per month. China Merchants has ships such as the Jiang'an, Jiangshun, Jiangxin, Jianghua, Jiangyu, Jiangtian, Jiangjing, Jiangda, and Jianguo, and the number of flights per month is the same as Taikoo and others. Sanbei has eight ships, such as the Xinningxing, Dean, Qingbo, Songbo, and Fengpu. Ningshao has two ships, the Ningshao and Ningjing. After the January 28th Incident, the Nisshin Company reduced four ships, such as the Xiangyang, Nanyang, Luoyang, and Fengyang. Therefore, the six companies operating Shanghai-Hankou flights have a total of more than 40 ships.</p>
<h3>Lack of Both Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>The lack of imports and exports on the Yangtze River recently is unprecedented. After the floods occurred, the various Yangtze River customer gangs suspended or stopped loading goods in order to prevent floods, resulting in a daily reduction in freight in this street. It all depends on the transit of goods from other ports, but there is also a shortage of goods coming from the Yangtze River. Recently, the Wuhu Zhenchang and other rapeseed companies packed 600,000 bags to Shanghai, which were purchased by eight oil factories in Shanghai. Because the various ships competed too fiercely for loading, the freight rates dropped sharply. Even if the price was fixed and a 5.95% commission was given, it was fortunate to be able to transport some of the goods. There are no other large quantities of goods to transport.</p>
<h3>Decided to Suspend Scheduled Ships</h3>
<p>The fundamental solution discussed by the six companies is to reduce the number of ships by all six companies. There is no other way. As a result, it was agreed that Taikoo Company would suspend three ships, Jardine Matheson would also suspend three ships, the China Merchants Bureau would suspend three ships, the Jiangtian, Jiangyu, and Jiangda, Ningshao would suspend the Ningjing, and Sanbei Company would also suspend one ship. Because the Nisshin Company had already reduced four Yangtze River ships after the January 28th Incident, it was not necessary to discuss it for the time being. The suspension of the other shipping companies will be implemented from July 1st.</p>
<h3>Increase in Empty Ships Moored in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Because of poor business, the upstream ships of the various Yangtze River companies that are moored in Shanghai number seven or eight. In addition, the upper and lower Yangtze River ships of the Nisshin Company that are moored in the Huangpu River and have not been sailing originally numbered 15. Except for the Daheng and Dafu, which were sold to Japan, there are still 13 ships. Now, with the addition of the reduced flights from the various companies, the number of ships moored empty on the Yangtze River will increase to more than 30.</p>
<h3>British Pilot Hutton Will Come to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>British pilot Hutton and his party of five recently came to China from the United Kingdom for a tour. They first went to Guangzhou and will come to Shanghai soon. The Guangdong Provincial Government has transferred the matter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that they be taken care of when Hutton and others arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shen Honglie's Telegram to Bohai Naval Officers</h3>
<p>According to reliable naval sources, since the Bohai Fleet incident, all parties have paid unusual attention to it. The reporter from the Daily News visited a naval official yesterday and was shown a telegram recently sent by Shen Honglie to all the officers of the fleet. The telegram was obtained from an officer on a ship that left Qingdao. The original text is as follows: (Omissions) I was summoned to Beijing by the authorities a few days ago, as reported in the telegram. I stayed in Beijing for five days and met with Mr. Chiang and Mr. Wang many times. They were very clear about the situation of our navy and Qingdao's municipal administration, and they were very appreciative and treated me with great courtesy. All military and political affairs were encouraged to be maintained as before. As for naval administration and salaries, a method has been determined to make our navy the First Fleet and the Fujian navy the Second and Third Fleets, in order to seek superficial unity while respecting the facts. Mr. Shen also requested Mr. Chiang to order the naval department to hand over all the naval offices in the Nanjing Military Commission to our side to organize and take charge, so as to facilitate all contacts. Mr. Chiang has agreed to Chen Zun's office and has decided to appoint Principal Wang of the Naval Academy to take charge. Mr. Shen also explained to Mr. Chiang the history of the Fujianese controlling the navy and firmly insisted that cooperation was impossible unless the navy was fundamentally reorganized first. He was very accommodating. The heads of the various departments and councils in Nanjing also expressed great appreciation for the achievements of our army and the anti-Japanese plan for the Jiaolong defense in Yanlong. The impression of the Qingdao navy is also good in other places. Attached is the news, Shen Honglie Yin.</p>
<h3>The Health Department Convened a Meeting of Pharmacists in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Health Department of the Ministry of Interior, in view of the need to regulate the standards of imported medicinal materials and medicines sold on the market, specially convened a meeting of relevant pharmacists at the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory in Zhabei yesterday to discuss everything, so as to collect opinions from all parties to plan a method to ensure that the quality and standards of all medicines on the market are uniform. The meeting was chaired by Liu Ruiheng, the director of the Health Department, and those who attended included Jin Baoshan of the Health Department, Cheng Shuzhen of the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory, Tu Kaizheng of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Zhou Mengbai, Sun Choucheng, Xiang Shengwu, Ye Hanchen, Wu Guanmin, Zhao Songyuan, Zhao Rutiao, Liu Buqing, Zhu Ruichen, Xu Xiaochu, Mai Yishan, Chen Jianxin, Huang Yusheng, Hu Guangzu, and Zhang Xianda, and others. The meeting lasted for more than two hours before it adjourned. Officials and businessmen exchanged opinions and were very harmonious. It was decided to start with the chemical examination of various drugs.</p>
<h3>Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week in This City</h3>
<p>Begins Today</p>
<p>The annual International Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week has begun today. All countries in the world will have grand propaganda and enthusiastic celebrations to arouse the public to promote the cooperative movement. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the China Cooperative Society and other organizations have discussed this matter several times. It was resolved that, in addition to publishing a special cooperative issue in major newspapers today and inviting cooperative experts to give public lectures at the Sichuan Road Youth Association and the Wenmiao Road Public Education Center from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, it is also heard that Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, has been appointed to give a radio broadcast to promote the propaganda. It is also heard that the members of the China Cooperative Society and the teachers and students of the Cooperative Research Class attached to the society will hold a dinner party at the Tongxing Restaurant on Sima Road at 7:00 PM to connect with each other and discuss all the progress issues of the class.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Wine Industries Jointly Oppose the New Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>Returning Representatives Petitioned the Tax Administration and Tax Bureau Again</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Ministries to Stop County Police from Assisting in Harassment</p>
<p>Notifying Local Industries to Refuse to Pay and Persist to the End</p>
<p>Shaoxing Wine Industry Association Convened an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco and Wine Industries Joint Association, because the Tax Administration abolished the public sale and collection of taxes, formulated new quota regulations, which are scheduled to be implemented on July 1. The association, etc., believes that the new regulations are harsh and troublesome, and the penalties are severe. After implementation, it will have a significant impact on the commercial transportation of the two industries. Therefore, the Standing Committee of the two industries specially held a temporary emergency meeting the other day. Considering that the date of implementation of the new regulations is very urgent, and the handling procedures are urgent, it was decided to continue to send the six representatives who went to Beijing to petition to the Tax Administration and the Tax Bureau to personally state the harsh facts and request that the new regulations be abolished. They also telegraphed the Central Party Department, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, appealing for an order to the municipal and county governments of Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou to stop the Public Security Bureau from assisting in tax collection, so as to avoid conflict. The following is a record of the telegrams from various parties:</p>
<h3>Telegramming Various Agencies</h3>
<p>To the Central Party Department, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: The association, etc., previously stated that the Tax Administration illegally formulated regulations on local tobacco and wine taxes, which were harsh and troublesome, and the fines were heavy, which would wipe out commercial transportation and were inhumane. The association, etc., telegraphed on the relevant day and sent representatives Cao Gexian, Jin Xuejie, Yu Xunlu, Huang Yuming, Dai Zhuo, and Huang Wenqing to Beijing to petition. The ministries and courts received them, and the representatives stated the harsh facts of the new system. They were honored to be adopted and promised to amend them. A special article was also submitted requesting abolition. Unexpectedly, a day later, news came that was unexpected. It was reported that the Ministry of Finance ordered the seven provinces of Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, and Fujian to start the stamp tax on tobacco and alcohol and the quota tax on local wine on July 1 this year. We are shocked. It has been found that the Tax Administration illegally formulated new tax regulations, which have been listed and presented according to law. The association, etc., publicly appointed representatives to go to Beijing to petition on behalf of all tobacco and wine merchants in Huining and Suzhou. The reason is that the new system of the bureau is illegal, the procedures are harsh, and the penalties are severe, and it cannot be absolutely recognized. If it is forcibly implemented, it will inevitably lead to incidents. Who will follow? Who will bear the blame? The association, etc., is harming the commercial transportation of the tobacco and wine industries in Huning and Suzhou. We hereby telegraphically state that we respectfully request your review and quickly order the bureau to abolish the new system, so as to avoid unfortunate incidents. We will be very grateful, and we hope to receive a telegram in reply to comfort us. Zhang Dalian, the chairman of the United Association of Tobacco and Wine Industries in Huining and Suzhou, Standing Committee members Jin Yunjie, Dai Zhuan, Jin Jiayue, and Chen Weiwen, Chen Liangyu, the chairman of the United Association of Tobacco and Wine Industries in Huining and Suzhou, and Standing Committee members Yu Xunlu, Zhang Suhou, Cao Gexian, and Shen Weiting, bow, Yan Yin.</p>
<h3>Submitting Documents to the Tax Administration</h3>
<p>The six representatives petitioned, and the document submitted to the Tax Administration stated: "For the sake of urgently requesting the abolition of the local tobacco and wine tax regulations, and the exemption of local tobacco and wine taxes to help merchants in difficulty and avoid disputes. It has been found that domestic tobacco and wine have been taxed through public sales for more than ten years, and merchants have not been inconvenienced. Recently, it was heard that your office plans to abolish public sales and formulate regulations on the special tax on the local tobacco industry and the quota tax on local wine, which are scheduled to be implemented on July 1. The association, etc., believes that the matter is related to the burden of the two industries and endangers the livelihood, and appointed Cao Gexian, Jin Wenjie, Yu Xunlu, Huang Yuming, Dai Zhuan, and Huang Wenqing as representatives of all the industries in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou to go to Beijing to petition the Central Party Department, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to clarify the harshness of the new tax and request the suspension of its implementation, and to submit it to the Ministry of Finance for review. The representatives returned to Shanghai to report that they met Secretary Chen of the Legislative Yuan, Counselor Chen of the Executive Yuan, and Secretary-General Yang of the Ministry of Finance. The representatives detailed the new system, which was harsh and the fines were severe. Once implemented, not only would the burden increase suddenly, but even the slightest carelessness would lead to legal problems. It can be seen that the local tobacco and local wine would be wiped out, which is equivalent to promoting foreign goods and destroying domestic products. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, rescuing is feared to be too late, so how can we bear to harass it again? We request that you quickly order the abolition of the new system to help merchants in difficulty. Responsible personnel from the upper-level agencies replied that the case was handled by the Tax Administration, so they should explain it in detail to the office to determine the course of action, so the representatives returned to Shanghai to report to the superiors for review and handling. It has been found that the association, etc., publicly appointed representatives to go to Beijing to petition on behalf of all tobacco and wine merchants in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou. The reason is that the new system of local tobacco and wine taxes proposed by your office is harsh, and the penalties are severe, and it cannot be absolutely recognized. If it is forcibly implemented, then all tobacco and wine merchants in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou still have hearts and blood, and they will naturally refuse to pay and persist to the end. Any sacrifice will be made at all costs. It will inevitably lead to incidents. Who will take the lead? Who will bear the blame? The association, etc., is preventing disasters before they happen and stopping harm before it comes, so we have to run around and shout out. According to the previous report, in addition to ordering the representatives to visit and state the case, we should present the document to respectfully request your Excellency to grant us an audience, adopt our humble opinions, and admire your Excellency's impartiality and integrity. We will definitely resolutely abolish the aforementioned new system to help merchants in difficulty and avoid disputes. The time is pressing, and we cannot choose our words carefully. We are very anxious to wait for orders." We respectfully present this to Xie, the director of the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and the content of the presentation to the director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Wine Tax Bureau is the same, which is omitted here.</p>
<h3>Letter to Fellow Professionals in Various Counties</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of Directly Addressing: Our association and others have investigated that the Tax Bureau has abolished the old regulations and established new ones, scheduled to take effect on July 1st. This matter concerns the burden on both industries and endangers livelihoods. We dispatched Cao Gexian and five others as representatives to petition in Beijing, and also submitted requests to higher-level agencies to abolish the new system. Now, according to the report from the representatives who returned to Shanghai, they met with Secretary Chen of the Legislative Yuan, Counselor Chen of the Executive Yuan, and Secretary-General Yang of the Ministry of Finance, detailing the onerous and troublesome nature of the new system. The responsible personnel of the higher-level agencies replied that the case was mainly handled by the Tax Bureau and that the issue should be explained in detail to the bureau to determine the course of action. The representatives returned and went to the Tax Bureau and the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to petition. Although they did not get a satisfactory result, the responsible personnel of the bureau verbally agreed to discuss and amend the regulations. However, the date of implementation is approaching, and we fear that the tax collection sub-bureaus in various counties will cater to the authorities and enforce the regulations. If this occurs, the tobacco and alcohol merchants of Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou will undoubtedly refuse to pay and persevere to the end, regardless of any sacrifice. We are issuing this order to prevent disasters before they happen and to stop harm before it arrives. In addition to submitting reports to the Shanghai and Ningbo Municipal Governments and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, we are also sending letters to various county governments, instructing the Public Security Bureaus, district offices, and others to temporarily suspend assistance to avoid disputes. Furthermore, we are sending this special letter to you, hoping that your association will investigate and, before the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance issue a clear resolution on this case, if any tax authorities harass and disturb the merchants, first report to the nearest chamber of commerce for assistance. At the same time, send a telegram to our association to strive for a justified resolution and alleviate the pain. Attached is a letter to the county government, which your association should designate a representative to deliver in person for negotiation. Respectfully, to the Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association of a certain county. Attached: one official letter.</p>
<h3>Submission to Provincial and Municipal Governments</h3>
<p>Submission regarding the unauthorized formulation of local tobacco and alcohol tax regulations by the Tax Bureau, scheduled for implementation, fearing coercive actions and inciting incidents, requesting the authorities to order the Public Security Bureau and district offices to temporarily suspend assistance, to alleviate merchants' difficulties and avoid disputes. We, the association, previously heard that the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau is changing regulations regarding the tobacco and alcohol tax rates for the 22nd year, revoking the public sales system, and revising the special tax on local tobacco leaves and the fixed tax on local alcohol. The articles are onerous and the fines are severe. Once implemented, it will not only increase the burden sharply, but also lead to legal troubles with the slightest carelessness. The local tobacco and alcohol will soon be wiped out, which will encourage foreign goods and destroy domestic products. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, even rescue efforts are not enough; how can we bear further harassment? Our association and others have resolved in a general meeting to appoint six representatives to go to Beijing and petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to abolish the bureau's unauthorized new system. According to the report from the representatives who returned to Shanghai, they have obtained the permission of the higher-level agencies, and the bureau's newly established regulations will be submitted to the Yuan and Ministry, which have the power to review and revise them for correction. Therefore, the representatives returned to Shanghai to report for examination and handling. According to the investigation, the bureau's new system is cumbersome and punitive, and we absolutely cannot accept it. If it is forcibly implemented, the tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shanghai, Ningbo, and Suzhou will undoubtedly refuse to pay and persevere to the end, regardless of any sacrifice. We are afraid that the bureau will act arbitrarily and order the Public Security Bureau and its district offices to send police to intimidate us, which will inevitably incite incidents. Whose fault will it be? To prevent disasters before they happen and to stop harm before it arrives, in addition to submitting reports to the Shanghai and Ningbo Municipal Governments and sending letters to various county governments, we specially submit this document requesting your authority to examine and approve, and promptly order the Public Security Bureau to notify its district offices that before the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance issue a clear resolution on this case, if the Tax Bureau and the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau request police assistance, they should temporarily suspend it to alleviate merchants' difficulties and avoid disputes. We also request instructions to follow, as it is for the public good. Also, the letters to various county governments have the same content and are omitted here.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Wine Industry Conference</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing Wine Industry Association convened its 26th emergency executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Ding Jinsheng chaired the meeting, and all executive committee members performed the rituals as usual. Proposals: (1) Regarding the Tax Bureau's change of the public sales system to a fixed tax on local alcohol, the newly established tax regulations will be implemented on July 1st. It was argued that the regulations are onerous and the tax is increased several times, which is unbearable for merchants. Moreover, due to the impact of the war, there has been no recovery. The bureau's sudden implementation of detailed regulations will destroy the livelihood of our industry. All executive committee members unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and Chairman Chiang in the capital, requesting a postponement of the harsh taxation to alleviate merchants' difficulties. In addition to submitting requests to the ministry and Yuan, they also prepared documents to submit to the Tax Bureau, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. As a public association, we should fulfill our duties and strive for justice, and never protect the authorities. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The telegram to the Executive Yuan stated: "To the Executive Yuan: Recently, we heard that the Tax Bureau has completely abolished the liquor public sales system implemented in the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, and other provinces over the years, and promulgated 40 new articles of the local alcohol fixed tax regulations and the local alcohol fixed tax rate table, which will be implemented on July 1st of this year. We found that the articles of the regulations are cumbersome and do not conform to commercial practices. The tax rate table imposes excessive taxes, which is difficult for the people to bear. Once implemented, domestic products will inevitably be gradually destroyed, and imported wines will be sold smoothly, which will endanger the people's livelihood and social stability. We request that your President promptly stop this and temporarily postpone the implementation. We urgently pray. The Shanghai Shaoxing Wine Industry Association."</p>

<p>Attending Shareholders: Chuan Xiaoan, Xie Hengchuang, Hong Yanbin, Deng Ruiren, Li Shuxiong, Shen Lianfang, Wang Xinguan, Sheng Zecheng, Chuan Pinggui, Wu Yaqin, Zhu Huanwen, Chen Jiugao, Qian Xuanqing, Sun Heping, Dai Chengzhi, Ms. Chen Guanying, and 282 others. Observers: Huang Jintao, Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry; Wang Zhongwu, Section Chief of the Ministry of Communications; Yao Yongli, permanent legal advisor; and Xu Yongzuo, Tong Shiwen, and accountants.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Vice Chairman Chuan Xiaoan was elected as Chairman. After performing the rituals as usual, the Chairman gave a report, stating:</p>
<p>This meeting was originally scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM, but it was changed to 4:00 PM due to the late arrival of shareholders from other places. A total of 297 shareholder rights, 67,080 shares, and 373,325 shares were reached. The total number of shareholders is only one-sixth. Due to time constraints, we were unable to attend the meeting, so we will begin to discuss the amendments to the articles of association today as a provisional resolution. All articles of association are incompatible with the current trend of the times, and it is necessary to amend them. Therefore, if there are any inappropriate words or obscure meanings in each article, please raise them for discussion by the shareholders. Because I am old and weak, I would like to ask Mr. Wu Yaqin to represent me in reading the articles of association. Also, the chairman of our company, Sun Muhan, has passed away, so three people will act as chairmen in place of the vice chairman.</p>
<p>Amending the Articles of Association: After the Chairman's report, Wu Yaqin read and discussed the articles of association one by one. Shareholder Hong Yanbin proposed that those articles of association that are incompatible with the current trend of the times should be amended. After the Chairman amended them, they were all passed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Resolves to Sanction Stores That Do Not Join the Association</h3>
<p>Please Order a Trial Chapter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "The purpose of organizing a trade association is to organize the public and coordinate business operations. However, there is no clear provision in the law. Although trade associations have been established, countless cunning people believe that joining the association requires obeying uniform prices, which loses the freedom of will, and they are reluctant to move forward. Moreover, they widely publicize this, causing those who have joined the association to be forced to withdraw, which makes it impossible for the association to exert its functions and implement its purpose. Moreover, there are no sanctions in the law for those who withdraw from the association, fail to pay membership fees, or do not join the association. If this continues, it will make it impossible for those who have not organized to organize, and those who have organized will collapse. The proposed measures are as follows: (1) Order all trades to join the association; (2) Request the Legislative Yuan to add a provision in the Trade Association Law that requires joining a trade association; (3) Request the Legislative Yuan to transfer to the law enforcement agencies to order businesses that do not join the association to suspend business. Representatives of the copper-iron machinery industry, the Chinese and foreign grocery industry, the shoe-leather nail-last industry, and the cosmetics industry also made similar proposals to the meeting. The key to the difficulty of this matter lies in the fact that it must be in accordance with legal principles and have a compulsory effect. The compulsory measures proposed by the association, etc., have been forwarded to your bureau and have been recorded. However, there are relevant legal issues involved. The association has attached its opinions and stated that the first item of the measures proposed by the laundry industry association has already been included in Article 7 of the amended Trade Association Law, and the second level seems to be hindered by many laws and regulations. The association also found that among the various industries, only the rice shop industry has mostly joined the association, because the Public Works Department's donation license is transferred by the association on behalf of the association. Merchants seek this convenience and gather unexpectedly. If we can imitate its method, and designate the association to handle all special events related to the government, then the effect of Dong Quan is better than oppression. If your bureau can formulate a special chapter for trial within the scope of its authority, it will be more convenient. After being submitted to the general meeting for a vote, it was resolved to continue the previous case and submit a strong request to your bureau for examination and processing. It is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau."</p>
<h3>Autopsy of Female Worker Who Died Suddenly at Meiya Today</h3>
<p>The Four Female Workers Were Released on Bail Last Night</p>
<p>Han Shengxiang, a 15-year-old female worker from Shaoxing at No. 175 Meiya Second Silk Weaving Factory on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, was sent to Baolong Hospital on Baike Road for treatment at 1:00 AM on the 29th by her companions Wang Hefen, Qiu Guifen, Xue Meihua, and Qiu Genfen. The doctor at the hospital found that her lower body was injured, and she died at 1:40 AM after ineffective treatment. The hospital reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent the body to the morgue and detained the four companions and a male foreman, who were transferred to the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. It has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the First Special Court, for the sake of caution, has decided to send a prosecutor and a forensic doctor from the Public Works Department to the morgue at 9:00 AM today to conduct a second autopsy. At the same time, the four female workers mentioned above and the male foreman of the factory, Yu Heshu, were summoned to appear in court for questioning. However, at about 9:30 PM last night, all the male and female workers of the factory requested the director of the Second Factory, Wang Rong, to request the Fourth District Headquarters to temporarily release them on bail because the truth of the case was unclear. The Gan District Chief approved the bail and released them, and they are allowed to appear in court for interrogation at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xingen Released from Abduction</h3>
<p>Two Kidnappers Arrested</p>
<p>On the evening of the third day of the ninth lunar month of the previous year, Zhu Shuzhi's 14-year-old eldest son Zhu Xingen and 13-year-old second son Zhu Liangen were kidnapped by more than ten kidnappers from the Lijiashuyuan Township in Pudong. A huge ransom was demanded for their release. On April 13th of this year, after several contacts with the kidnappers, the victim offered 2,500 yuan and only redeemed his youngest son Liangen. Xingen was still hidden in the kidnappers' den, and a huge ransom was demanded. No agreement has been reached so far. Jin Jiulin, an inspector of the special agency of the French Concession Police, learned that the kidnappers were hiding in Room 36 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession. At noon yesterday, they opened Room 42 of the Siming Hotel on Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession to negotiate the ransom. Inspector Jin immediately led detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, Bao Tan Qin Youyu, Cai Jinzhang, Ma Yizhi, and others in disguise to the scene. First, they arrested Yang Linsheng (42 years old) from Pudong, a kidnapper, in front of No. 616 Xizang Road. Then, they arrested Yang Hanchu (23 years old) from Pudong in the Hongxiang Hotel. They intercepted the hostage Zhu Xingen at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road and took them back to the police station. First, the hostage was handed over to the victim, and Yang and others were detained for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Case of Actor Zhao Ruquan Accused of Embezzling Huge Sums</h3>
<p>Actor Zhao Ruquan is a shareholder and cashier of the Sanxing Stage. Recently, Zhou Bingchen, a shareholder and former manager of the stage, discovered that Zhao had embezzled a huge sum of money. He collected evidence and hired lawyers Chen Tingrui, Yuan Yang'an, and Du Jimei to report to the police station, ordering detective Chen Yonggui to arrest Zhao and file a public lawsuit. The First Special District Court has conducted several trials, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial in the Criminal Court No. 1. The lawyer of the police station, Ru Bao Yi, stated that since the accountant Zhao Zuwei reviewed the accounts and reported to the court, the defendant requested permission for his accountant, Jiang Wanping, to re-examine them. With the court's permission, Jiang's report has now been submitted to the court. If it has been submitted, please issue a copy for review. Judge Feng then issued Jiang's report and questioned Zhao Ruquan. According to Zhao's accountant's report, the Sanxing Stage should have more than 60,000 yuan in cash, but the passbooks of the Siming Bank are over-deducted. In total, the amount is only 40,000 yuan, which is less than 20,000 yuan. Where did it come from? Zhao replied, "All the money I received has been presented to the court. The rest of the money is in the outside account room and has nothing to do with me." He was also asked that the income of the Sanxing Stage has been huge in recent years. If it is all deposited in the bank, the interest alone must be considerable. However, the interest in the folding you presented to the court is extremely levied, so whether the income is deposited in the bank. Reply, "I am extremely busy, so sometimes the money I receive cannot be immediately handed over to the bank. I will hand it over a few days later. Sometimes, because I need to use the money, I will not hand it over to the bank." At this time, the accountant Jiang stood up and gave a detailed report on the review of the accounts, which lasted a long time. After the report was completed, the court asked Zhao's accountant what opinions he had on Jiang Wanping's report. Zhao's accountant replied that Jiang's report had just been received and could not be read in detail, so he could not comment for the time being and would submit a written report to the court tomorrow. Judge Feng then questioned Zhao Ruquan, saying that according to what you said, the money on the deposit book is still more than 3,000 yuan short of the cash that should be deposited. Where is this money now? Zhao replied, "It is all in the iron cabinet of the Sanxing Stage." The lawyer Jiang Yiping immediately stood up and said that this money has now been brought. Then, he presented the money and said that Zhao Ruquan is so stupid that it is ridiculous. He keeps the money he receives separate and does not combine it. It can be seen that he has no bad intentions. He also presented an account book, saying that this account book is for the collection and payment of money between the outside account room and Zhao Ruquan, and this book is very helpful to the defendant. The lawyer of the police station, Ru Bao Yi, immediately stood up and said that the account book presented by the defendant today was not mentioned before, and it was not presented until today, which is too late. As for the silver dollars presented in the case, it is said that they are still sealed and taken out of the iron cabinet. Since no one has seen the money before and it is hidden in the iron cabinet, what style is it? How can you know that it is still sealed and not taken out temporarily? Only God knows this. Judge Feng then questioned Zhao and others point by point in the accounts until dusk, and then ordered the hearing to be rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Execution of the Three Kidnappers in the Sun Yangru Case</h3>

<h3>Patrol Officer Dies Suddenly</h3>

<h3>Wang Yansong's Letter to Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>Ban Nude Body Movement</p>
<p>= The Nation is in Difficulty; Urge Calm and Hard Work</p>
<p>Do not Open the Door to Licentiousness and Extravagance =</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and General Manager of the Silk Industry Bank, stated that it had been reported that a nude body movement in Hong Kong was planning to come to Shanghai, which would have a profound and detrimental impact on public morals. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Mayor, requesting a ban. He also sent letters to various organizations, urging a unified stance. The original letter stated: "Mayor, I am writing to you after reading yesterday's news about the rumored arrival of a nude body movement from Hong Kong. I have read reports stating that this movement originated after the European War, advocated by a group of people with the intention of braving frost and dew to strengthen their bodies. However, according to national laws and regulations, any person who appears naked in streets or public gatherings is considered to be in violation of police regulations. This personal, curious behavior is not allowed by national laws and regulations. Moreover, there are many proper ways to exercise. Shanghai is one of the most important cities in the country and also a den of vice. Indulgence and absurdity are rampant. Those with weak wills are easily attracted to novelty and blindly follow. Furthermore, hearing that the proponents of this movement are foreigners, they will want to imitate and falsely claim it as civilization. If this is the case, humanity will regress to ancient times, and the corruption of morals will be led by this movement. In the past, film showings that appealed to sensuality were criticized and banned. How would this nude body movement compare to films that appeal to sensuality? It is self-evident. The nation is in difficulty; we should guide the people towards calmness and hard work, not open the door to licentiousness and extravagance. These foreigners are trying to organize a branch in Shanghai, perhaps exploiting our weaknesses and viewing it as a commercial venture. The way to govern a country is to balance flexibility and rigidity according to the times. In the past, Ms. Sanger's advocacy of birth control was met with criticism in Japan because it was incompatible with their national conditions. Therefore, no matter how foreigners promote this movement, it is not suitable for our country today, especially not in a city known as a den of vice. I hereby respectfully submit this letter, requesting that you investigate and prohibit it. At the same time, I am writing to the concession authorities, requesting them to take similar action. This would truly be a public service."</p>

The news obtained yesterday is as follows:</p>
<h3>Display Arrangement</h3>

<h3>Soliciting Gifts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various domestic goods manufacturers to solicit gifts for the venue. The letter stated: "Our Chamber believes that in recent years, domestic silk has been severely impacted by the dumping of foreign goods, leading to a decline in business, a worsening of people's livelihoods, and a deepening of the national economic crisis. To seek a solution, our Chamber, at the joint meeting of the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee on June 24th, decided to jointly organize the China National Silk Exhibition with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association, the Shanghai Electric Silk Factory Industry Association, and the Shanghai Silk Bank. The entire third floor of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Display Center will be used as the exhibition venue. Preparations are actively underway, and the opening is scheduled for July 9th. At that time, a grand gathering will be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Great Assembly Hall for three days to celebrate the event. We plan to ask domestic and foreign goods factories to donate gifts to be distributed to the guests as a form of advertising and remembrance. We admire your esteemed factory for its excellent products and widespread reputation. We are sending a representative to respectfully request your generous donation of gifts to attract interest."</p>
<h3>Reply from He and Cai</h3>
<p>(1) He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "I am writing in response to your esteemed letter. I have received your kind invitation to serve as a member of the China National Silk Exhibition Committee. I am grateful and honored. I will do my best to fulfill this role." (2) Cai Wuji, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, replied: "I have received your esteemed letter inviting me to serve as a member of the China National Silk Exhibition Committee. I am aware of my limited abilities and am hesitant to accept. However, as it concerns the promotion of domestic silk, I will strive to follow your instructions. I am writing this letter to inform you and hope you will take note."</p>
<h3>Huaxin Participates</h3>
<p>The Huaxin Printing and Dyeing Company has produced excellent and innovative products that are very fashionable. The factory is enthusiastically preparing to participate in the exhibition and has prepared dozens of the latest products to display at the venue.</p>
<h3>Wang Yansong Convenes</h3>
<p>Meeting of Representatives of Merchants in the National Goods Market</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Director of the Commodity Display Center, and General Manager of the Shanghai Silk Bank, convened a meeting of representatives of merchants in the National Goods Market at the dining area of the market at 12 noon on the 24th. More than 40 representatives attended. Mr. Wang delivered a speech, stating, "Since I took office as Director of the Commodity Display Center, it has been almost a year. Due to my heavy workload, I have had little contact with the representatives, and I have not made any achievements within the organization. I am deeply ashamed. I believe that in recent years, the domestic silk industry has been affected by the dumping policies of foreign goods, leading to a decline in business, making it difficult for factories to survive, and increasing the number of unemployed workers. The social situation is becoming increasingly unstable. If we do not seek a solution, the harm will be unimaginable. Therefore, I convened a joint meeting of the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on February 24th to discuss the issue. It was decided that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce National Goods Market, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association, the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory Association, and the Shanghai Silk Bank would jointly organize the China National Silk Exhibition and use the third floor of the Commodity Display Center as the exhibition venue. The opening is scheduled for July 9th. At that time, there will be a dazzling array of brocades and silks gathered in one room for public viewing, demonstrating the promotion of national goods. This exhibition bears the responsibility of revitalizing the national silk industry. If it is not handled properly, promoted effectively, and carried out proactively, it will be difficult to ensure that the national silk industry will be revived after the exhibition. If other industries are organized separately, it will not be difficult for our national goods to develop from this point. Furthermore, at the opening of this exhibition, I hope that the representatives will select more high-quality national goods and sell them at low prices to support the promotion of national goods." The representatives then delivered speeches in succession. Finally, the report on the conclusion of the issuance of profit coupons in the market was made. The meeting adjourned at around 4 PM.</p>

<p>Tai Bao Ashu, the bandit leader of Taihu Lake, had a large number of followers who formed gangs and disturbed travelers, robbed passing ships, kidnapped people for ransom, committed arson, and did everything evil. The authorities dispatched troops to suppress them repeatedly, but they could not be completely eliminated. It was not until the previous year that the Water Police successively arrested Tai Bao Ashu and other important members of his gang and sentenced them to death. During the interrogation, Gao Guiyou, Cai Axiao, Wu Yaogen, and others confessed that their accomplices, Shi Dianyuan and his mistress Wang Bamei, were also important members of the gang. They confessed that Wang Bamei had transported four rifles during the robbery of a ship in Yu Weitang. However, Shi and the others fled to other cities after the case occurred, and their whereabouts were uncertain, so they remained at large and could not be arrested. Recently, Luo Daokun, the captain of the Third Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, discovered that Shi and his wife were hiding at 1605, Lane 3, Fude Fang, Hed Road, in the Public Concession. Therefore, on the afternoon of the previous day, they notified the Jing'an Temple Police Station and secretly went with Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest them. However, Shi Dianyuan fled, and only his mistress Wang Bamei, also known as Zhang Wushi, was arrested. A colored photograph of the woman was also seized, which was the same as the photograph seized from Tai Bao Ashu's bandit ship in Jiaxing. She was taken to the police station and transferred to the women's prison. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. First, a Chinese detective described the circumstances of the arrest, and then Captain Luo Daokun submitted an official document stating that the real name of the defendant was Wang Bamei, the mistress of Shi Dianyuan, and a member of Tai Bao Ashu's gang. She had committed serious crimes in the past, as confessed by Cai Axiao and others. The confessions of Cai and others, along with the seized photographs, were submitted to the court, requesting permission to transfer her for interrogation. Zhang Wushi claimed that she lived in her hometown of Pinghu and had an elderly mother and a six-year-old child at home. Her husband, Zhang Jinsheng, died of illness on November 4th of last year. After her husband's death, she took her young child and came to Shanghai by boat. Because she had no way to make a living, she worked as a female tailor. She first lived in Rongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road, and moved to Fude Fang, Hed Road, in April, renting the front building for nine yuan a month. There were no men, only her mother and son living together. She did not know Shi Dianyuan and the others. The seized photographs were taken in March at a photo studio in Ba Xian Qiao and hung on the wall. The detectives took them away yesterday. She was a woman from the countryside, how could she be involved with bandits and transport guns? She asked for a fair judgment. Captain Luo stated that only one colored photograph was found during the arrest and that her clothes rack was full of men's clothes, apparently belonging to Shi. Lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the statements made by the defendant Zhang Wushi today were unreliable. Furthermore, the Provincial Public Security Team had already submitted photographs and confessions from accomplices, so there was sufficient evidence. The police did not object to the transfer. Judge Wu Tingqi approved the transfer of Zhang Wushi, also known as Wang Bamei, to Captain Luo Daokun of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police for interrogation.</p>

After being injured, Jiang hired a car to return to the office, where his colleagues accompanied him to Renji Hospital for treatment.

<p>Wang Shuangxi, a farmer in his late thirties from Changshu, came to Shanghai alone on the 26th and stayed at Room 99 on the upper floor of the Dongnan Hotel in Taiyuan Fang, French Concession. He had a history of opium addiction and had quit once. After arriving in Shanghai, he felt unwell and went out to smoke opium for several days, adding to his expenses. On the afternoon of the previous day, at around 3:30 PM, he felt financially strapped and desperate, so he secretly ingested a large amount of raw opium and committed suicide. He was discovered and sent to Renji Hospital by streetcar, but he died at 3:45 AM the next morning. The hospital reported the death to the Greater Cuckoo Clock Police Station, and detective Wang Licheng was dispatched to the scene.

However, Henan University is short of funds and it is difficult to operate. This time, he is determined to work hard for the academic community, regardless of personal sacrifice.</p>

<h3>Strange Developments in the Boxing World</h3>
<p>Former World Heavyweight Champion</p>
<p>Sharkey Suddenly Knocked Out</p>
<p>Canera's Amazing Feat</p>
<p>(New York, 29th) The world of heavyweight boxing is full of twists and turns. German master Schmeling was defeated by the American Max Baer, and now Italian giant Canera knocked out former champion Sharkey in the sixth round of a fifteen-round match. The heavyweight championship crown will now go to either Max Baer or Canera.</p>
<p>▲ The blast erupts, Italian Canera weighs 18 pounds and eight and a half ounces (each pound equals fourteen pounds), Sharkey only fourteen pounds five, a difference of more than fifty pounds. The contest was extremely heated. The outcome felt like a giant bomb exploding among the 40,000 spectators, leaving them in shock.</p>
<p>▲ Sharkey Falls and Cannot Rise, Sharkey had won the first five rounds, victory seemed to be in his grasp, but Canera unleashed all his strength, striking his opponent, then using his frighteningly short arms to strike upwards, Sharkey swayed and fell, unable to rise. This is his third defeat in his life.</p>
<p>▲ Punching the Opponent's Jaw, In the first round, Canera charged from the corner, looking excited. Sharkey lunged into the ring, hitting the opponent with a series of left punches. The Italian retaliated, driving Sharkey to the ropes. Sharkey then hit the opponent's head from the left, right and center. Before the first bell rang, the American's right hand landed squarely on Canera's jaw.</p>
<p>▲ Staggering by the Ropes, In the second round, the Italian acted cautiously, swinging his long arms. Sharkey's breathing became constricted. But he returned with a punch to the jaw, as heavy as a thousand pounds. Canera staggered by the ropes. The American intended to continue his advance, but suddenly came under attack himself, and could not proceed due to labored breathing. The second round ended there.</p>
<p>▲ Forced to Defend, In the third round, Sharkey remained calm, feinting attacks to confuse the opponent, hitting the head and body repeatedly. Canera was forced to defend under pressure.</p>
<p>▲ Warning for Foul Play, In the fourth round, the giant's left arm stretched out, suddenly hitting Sharkey, making him lose his balance. Fortunately, he was not injured due to proper handling. The Italian missed many opportunities at this time, and suddenly hooked Sharkey's left hand, pulling him closer, while repeatedly striking his head. The referee immediately issued a warning for this foul play.</p>
<p>▲ Swaying Back to Position, In the fifth round, Sharkey was about to take advantage of a moment of weakness when the Italian repeated his previous mistake, receiving another warning. The American attacked Canera forcefully. Before the bell rang, the Italian was punched and swayed back to his corner.</p>
<p>▲ Successful Blow, In the sixth round, Sharkey first hit the opponent's face, then struck his body. Canera retaliated, driving the champion back. Suddenly, he slipped, but immediately sprang up. Canera advanced with both left and right punches. Sharkey was struck and fell to the ground. The count of ten was over, and Sharkey still did not rise. The outcome was decided. The end of the round was two minutes and twenty-seven seconds.</p>

<h3>Primer on Transmitters</h3>
<p>— Jiancun</p>
<p>▲：：：：：▲</p>
<p>2.  Elements of a Transmitter</p>
<p>To understand the internal structure of a transmitter, one must first understand the general elements that make up a transmitter. The main elements are shown in the first diagram, and are described in detail below.</p>
<p>[Diagram 1]</p>
<p>Radio wave Antenna Ground Electrical Amplifier Oscillator Modulator Sound Amplifier Sound wave</p>
<p>(1) Microphone: A microphone is a device that converts sound waves, music, and other sound waves into electrical current. The current generated by the microphone changes according to changes in sound wave pressure. This type of current is commonly referred to as sound current.</p>
<p>(2) Sound Amplifier: The sound current generated by the microphone is extremely weak and must be amplified to an appropriate level by a sound amplifier before being sent to the modulator.</p>
<p>(3) Oscillator: An oscillator is used to generate an oscillating current of a certain frequency. The frequency of this oscillating current determines the wavelength of the radio wave emitted by the antenna. For example, the frequency of the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station is 680 kHz, and the converted wavelength of the emitted radio wave is 440 meters.</p>
<p>(4) Modulator: The function of the modulator is to synthesize the oscillating current and the sound current to generate a radio frequency current that can be emitted by the antenna. In other words, it changes the oscillating current into the waveform of the sound current.</p>
<p>(5) Power Amplifier: The modulated current after modulation is amplified to an appropriate level by the power amplifier and then emitted by the antenna.</p>
<p>(6) Antenna: Finally, the modulated current, which has been amplified to an appropriate level, is converted into a radio wave and emitted into space. This is the function of the antenna.</p>
<h3>Simplified Wavelength Calculation Method</h3>
<p>— Chen Ren</p>
<p>The usual method for calculating wavelength is to use the following formula:</p>
<p>λ = 1884√(LC)</p>
<p>λ is the wavelength (in meters), L is the inductance (in millihenries), and C is the capacitance (in microfarads).</p>
<p>For example, if you have a 0.0005 µF capacitor and a 73 µH coil, to find the wavelength:</p>
<p>λ = 1884√(73 * 0.0005) = 359.8 meters</p>
<p>Now, if we know the product of L and C required for a certain wavelength, then it is very easy to find L or C. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>Wavelength Frequency Product of Inductance and Capacitance (i.e., L x C)</p>
<p>200 1.500 0.01129</p>
<p>220 1.363 0.01362</p>
<p>240 1.250 0.01623</p>
<p>260 1.154 0.01902</p>
<p>280 1.071 0.02209</p>
<p>300 1.000 0.02530</p>
<p>320 0.937 0.02884</p>
<p>340 0.882 0.03249</p>
<p>360 0.833 0.03648</p>
<p>380 0.789 0.04070</p>
<p>400 0.750 0.04507</p>
<p>420 0.714 0.04970</p>
<p>440 0.682 0.05446</p>
<p>According to the above table, if you want to receive a wavelength of 360 meters and you have a 0.00025 mfd capacitor, to find the size of the coil to use, simply divide the product of inductance and capacitance (i.e., LC) by 0.00025. According to the table above, the LC for a wavelength of 360 is 0.03648. Divide 0.03648 by 0.00025 and you get 146.</p>
<p>If you have a 146 microhenry coil, to find the capacitance of the capacitor, simply divide 0.03648 by 146, which gives you 0.00025.</p>
<h3>Radio World Personalities</h3>
<p>Sommering</p>
<p>丨Inventor of Using Waterways to Replace Cables丨</p>
<p>Sommering was a German, born in 1755, who was a famous scientist when he died. While studying telegraphy, he thought of using waterways to replace cables and carried out his famous experiment. During the experiment, the current was interrupted due to incomplete equipment, and he made an incorrect judgment, believing that his ideal was impractical, which is a pity! Although his experiment was not continued, it did advance the practical methods of radio, which is noteworthy. The world's verdict on Sommering is:</p>
<p>"A person who sincerely loves science and is dedicated to public welfare."</p>

<h3>Radio Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(9) Coils</p>
<p>(1) Nature of Coils: In the radio world, the term "coil" should be called a self-inductance coil, but for the sake of brevity, it is simply called a coil. Any wire wound on a suitable frame can be called a coil. Some have iron cores, and some do not. In diagrams, a coil without an iron core is often represented by, and a coil with an iron core is represented by or . Both have self-inductance to resist alternating current. The greater the self-inductance, the smaller the alternating current passing through the coil, and the strength of the resistance varies with the size of the alternating current frequency. Generally, the higher the frequency, the stronger the resistance. This special resistance of the coil to alternating current is called reactance. This relationship can be expressed by the following formula. Let L be the self-inductance of the coil, be the frequency, and be the circumference ratio, i.e. 3.1416, then</p>
<p>Resistance = 2 × × Frequency × Self-Inductance = fL</p>
<p>(2) Unit: The unit of self-inductance in a coil is the henry (HenIy), abbreviated as h. However, in radio, the value of the henry is sometimes too large, so one thousandth of 1h is often used as a unit, called millihenry, abbreviated as m. Or one millionth is used as a unit, called microhenry, abbreviated as ub. Namely:</p>
<p>1h = 1000mh = 1,000,000uh</p>
<p>The self-inductance of a coil varies with its shape, number of turns, and the presence or absence of an iron core. Generally, the larger the shape of the coil and the more turns, the greater the self-inductance.</p>
<p>(3) Types of Coils: There are many types of coils used in the radio world. The most commonly used ones are shown in the following figure. In the figure, (1) is a spider web coil, (2) is a cylindrical coil, (3) is a honeycomb coil, (4) is a cage coil, and (5) is a stacked coil.</p>
<p>(4) Wire Used for Coils: At present, the copper wire used for coils is mostly silk-covered or yarn-covered wire from No. 10 to No. 30. It is difficult to say which number of copper wire is most suitable. If the diameter of the copper wire used is large, the consumption resistance is less, but the coil made is often too large, so generally No. 22 to No. 30 is the most suitable.</p>
<p>The size of copper wire is expressed by numbers. There are two standards for expressing the number of copper wire, one is the American standard, abbreviated as B.S., and the other is the British standard, abbreviated as B.W.G.</p>
<p>Book says.</p>
<p>Performance of Lida Broadcasting Station The Lida Radio Company of Mahuo Road has recently established a broadcasting station. All the broadcasting bulbs and components used are the finest, and the broadcasting performance is considered unique. All the design of the station is undertaken by radio expert Xi Shiying. The programs are the best. Those with radios, please pay attention to the station's programs.</p>

<h3>Starting with a Headache</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>Ever since I saw the "Talk more about romance, less about complaints" notice from the Free Talk editor, I've had a headache that hasn't stopped. The doctor told me that headaches are a sign of neurasthenia. To prevent headaches, don't use your mind. The best thing to do is to find friends to chat with or go out to play after eating every day. If you're tired, go to sleep. If you wake up hungry, eat something. After eating, go out to play or chat again. In short, live a pig-like life of "being full all day and doing nothing." Heaven! How can I do that? Not only do my life and work not allow me to not work, but even if my body gets two days of rest temporarily, it is absolutely impossible to prevent my brain from thinking in an hour.</p>
<p>"Unless you cut off my head, there's no way to stop me from thinking!" I protested to the doctor one day very seriously.</p>
<p>"May I ask what good is it to use your brain all day long?" He also questioned me seriously.</p>
<p>"Who cares if it's good or bad, anyway, she wants to think, what can I do?"</p>
<p>"Okay, then don't complain about headaches and insomnia in the future, and don't come to see me often."</p>
<p>That's it, now I don't even dare to tell the doctor that I'm sick.</p>
<p>○○○○</p>
<p>I'm more of a talkative and complaining person, which is mostly due to the promotion of the environment, but now I'm encountering an extremely silent life. Although friends often write to encourage me to write something, I feel that if this continues, I won't even be able to write a letter in the future. I really want to take the opportunity to cheer myself up with someone urging me, but what to write? Not only can I not participate in national affairs, but it is impossible to even talk about them, so what else can I write? I can't write or want to write about romance, suicide, and love, so what else can I write?</p>
<p>I remember when Mr. Li Liewen first took over the editorship of Free Talk, I was very enthusiastic and got a few things done in those days. Someone asked me, "You've written a lot of things recently!" I replied to him: "Not really, but because it's Free Talk, I'm happy to have a free talk."</p>
<p>But what about now? The word "no" has to be added to "Free Talk," so what else can we write?</p>
<p>Someone wrote to me and said: "Now the misfortune of Chinese writers has arrived. If they can only make a living by selling articles, they can only wait to die." I wrote back to him and said: "If they don't think of a way to break out of a new path, it's best to dig their graves first and crawl into the ground."</p>
<p>Friends who are engaged in writing, what are you going to do? June 18, 1933, in Long</p>
<h3>Looking at "The Big Parade"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>It seems the Second World War is about to begin, and like a lesson to be reviewed, we need to re-examine the scene of 1914. We squeezed among the foreign soldiers, watching the performance of "The Big Parade"; what was projected onto my heart was the giant's hairy palm, making me tremble and filling me with awe at the unknowable destiny!</p>
<p>The scene of the soldiers' jubilation on the battlefield when the armistice news arrived moved me deeply. But what happened after returning from the battlefield? Like the fate of the free farmers of Rome, "Having fulfilled his duty to the country, he went out to fight for his country without complaint; after ten, fifteen, twenty years, he returned home, his land overgrown with weeds, and his home ruined. Nevertheless, he was willing to start all over again. He tilled the land, sowed the seeds, and hoped for a harvest. He took his grain, cattle, sheep, ducks, and chickens to the market, but there were many large landowners who used slaves to cultivate the land, deliberately depreciating the prices of all goods, so he suffered great losses. For two years, he could still maintain his own livelihood. But later, he was desperate and had to abandon his land. He left the countryside and came to the nearest city. He was starving in the city, just as he had been in the fields. But there was no other way but to endure the same suffering as thousands of other landless poor people. They all squatted in dilapidated houses outside the city, making them easily susceptible to infectious diseases and death. They went out to fight for their country, but received such a reward in return." (Hendrik Willem van Loon, *The Story of Mankind*)</p>
<p>Therefore, the sharp call to arms caused millions of prospective widows and orphans to crowd the stations; the bugle call caused millions of strong young men to fall crippled and broken on the trenches; where the forty-two centimeter guns passed, tall buildings turned to ashes; airplanes circled over the city of Paris, frightening men and women in the streets to scatter like birds and beasts; the battlefield hospitals could not treat the wounded soldiers in time, leaving them to writhe and scream to death; each of these scenes was a heartbreaking tragedy; but thinking of starving to death in the city, these lives cut short seemed much happier.</p>
<p>A friend who hurriedly shaved his beard upon hearing the armistice news, recalling Wilson's speech in Washington about fighting for peace, and generously enlisting in the army, could not help but laugh at himself. But when he joined the breadline and stepped into Washington to petition, recalling that he hurriedly shaved his beard upon hearing the armistice news, he could not help but laugh at himself again.</p>
<p>However, humanity is always forgetful. The crippled and broken have died one after another, and there are those who are preparing to sacrifice themselves on the battlefield for a speech. The performance of "The Big Parade" is precisely a suggestion of this serious epoch!</p>
<h3>The Neighbors</h3>
<p>— Peng Jiahuan</p>
<p>When I knocked on the back door at eleven o'clock that night, I saw a friend from the small room next door also knocking on the door. He knocked so rhythmically and gently, calling out, "Mom of so-and-so, please open the door!" His head was looking up at the dark and cold small room. Naturally, so was I.</p>
<p>We began to wander under the window. Although we didn't talk, our hearts were well aware of each other's troubles.</p>
<p>Instead of hearing footsteps on the stairs, someone came downstairs. My back door suddenly opened with a bang, like a scene from an empty fort strategy. What could be said in the middle of the night? Prepare for total annihilation, that's all. Embracing the spirit of sacrifice, I walked in blankly. Trembling and shrinking beside the sleeping child, my heart was breaking as I thought about the failure of the day's efforts, especially the fear that I would be torn apart by harsh words and venomous tongues. I couldn't help but concentrate and forget myself, forgetting everything close to me, to listen to the commotion in the small room next door. I believed that was the best way to deal with me.</p>
<p>The woman's voice kept coming from the small room next door:</p>
<p>"You wild thing, did you go out to borrow money? You wild boar! You have to come home at this hour to borrow money!"</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm asking you, I'm asking you, you borrowed money, you borrowed money, where is the money? Hurry up and give it to me, you dead man!"</p>
<p>"Oh, you spend the whole day playing outside, letting your wife and children eat gruel at home, are you human! Are you human! You pig, you dirty thing. If you have the guts, die outside and never come back!"</p>
<p>"This kind of man, huh, I've never seen such a man, useless, can't earn any money! And you pretend to be stupid, saying you have a place to borrow money, a place to borrow money, borrowing until midnight, how much did you borrow?"</p>
<p>"Dead man, bring it here, you won't bring it? Okay, okay, I want to see what you can do. I don't want to live like this anymore..."</p>
<p>Just as I was listening intently, suddenly my hair was pulled:</p>
<p>"Ghost, ghost, you think it's okay if you don't say anything, you think it's okay if you don't say anything! Humph, you think I'm an easy target, just wait, tomorrow, I'll tell on you..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I was listening to the noise in the small room next door, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but listen to the commotion in the small room next door, because it was the best way to deal with me. I thought the friend in the small room next door must be the same as me, because I never heard a sound from him.</p>
<h3>Respectful Reply to Mr. He Ru</h3>
<p>— Luo Fu</p>
<p>My "Further Explanation" was to avoid the suspicion of differing opinions, not to boast of unique insights, nor to risk being considered stale talk. If Mr. He Ru wants to seek the sword from the boat from this point, I admit that my wording is clumsy. Even if it is said to be "the Three Character Classic," if there is no respect between us, there is no need for dissatisfaction. Like my reply today, it is also "the Three Character Classic," because they are all "common knowledge." But it is not "casual writing, nor is it playing with things and neglecting one's duties." At least, it can "help to trace the historical origins," so it will not "misoccupy space" or "waste time." This is what I want to "solemnly declare."</p>
<p>The roles in Peking Opera are divided into civil and military, such as *Sheng* and *Wu Sheng*, *Xiao Sheng* and *Wu Xiao Sheng*, *Dan* and *Wu Dan*, *Chou* and *Wu Chou*, and there are also some roles that are both civil and military. But in Kun Opera, only some *Xiao Sheng* or *Sheng* wear military attire, and there is no title of *Wu Sheng*. The same is true for *Wu Dan*; for example, Wu Song in *The Tale of the Righteous Knight* is played by *Xiao Sheng*, and Gu Dasao is played by *Dan*. Yi Zhangqing is played by *Xiao Dan*, which is a good example. As for *Wu Chou*, it has existed in Peking Opera for a hundred years, but there is no precedent for even *Dao* roles in Kun Opera.</p>
<p>Because Kun Opera does not have military plays. In plays such as *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* and *Water Margin*, when it comes to fighting, it is just a scene change, not a big fight. As for somersaults and tiger leaps, Kun Opera would not have them. Therefore, there is no need to specially set up military roles.</p>
<p>The existence of military plays affects the music of the play. Like the music section of Peking Opera; commonly known as the stage, the stage is divided into civil and military stages. The large cymbals and drums are the military stage, and the *erhu*, *yueqin*, flute, and *sheng* are all the civil stage. The main music of Kun Opera is the *guan* and flute. The main music of the earlier Yiyang Opera and Kunshan Opera was the *suo*. Later, the main music of Chongyang Opera, Siyang Opera, and Qin Opera was the same. Only Gaoqiang does not use string and wind instruments together, only using gongs and drums. Except for this exception, the main instruments in the singing and dancing stage, besides string instruments, wind instruments, and percussion instruments, are still only drums and clappers, which is the civil stage of Eastern Opera. The scene of large cymbals and drums is to help the fighting, and only after military plays flourished did it have its path to find.</p>
<p>During the Qing dynasty, when the emperor returned to the palace after the winter solstice suburban sacrifice, there was a kind of ceremonial dance performed by the actors of the imperial theater from top to bottom, each receiving one tael of silver. This shows that somersaults and tiger leaps were originally a kind of street performance, and the music of the military stage was to boost the prestige of the street performance, it was the scene of the street performance. Later, the street performance and the old opera merged, and this scene also merged with the scene of the civil stage.</p>
<p>According to Gu [?], feats like tumbling were interspersed between civil stage dramas in the Ming dynasty, that is, they were not integrated into the drama. Instead, they were performed in the interlude between the end of play A and the beginning of play B to create a lively atmosphere. The music for this lively atmosphere was of course large cymbals and drums, but whether it was play A or play B, they were all civil stages. I have not missed anything except this.</p>
<p>But Mr. He Ru said, "Tumbling cannot be mixed with northern tunes, but there are military movements without cymbals and drums." This is because he did not "look closely at the following text," so he "cannot help but be disappointed." I have never said that "northern tunes have military movements"; I only said that military movements were not formally integrated into northern tunes, so the military stage with large cymbals and drums was also not formally integrated into northern tunes, and the earliest southern tunes were no exception. Therefore, regarding this point, I also "cannot agree and respectfully return it."</p>
<p>However, I boldly accept Mr. He Ru's generous gift. Because I advocate that "cymbals and drums and military movements simultaneously invaded old operas," but I do not acknowledge the "Three Character Classic" that "ever since there was such a thing as drama, it has never been separated from cymbals and drums," because I would not call wild street dances drama, and at least, spoken drama does not use cymbals and drums, which everyone should acknowledge.</p>
<p>Regarding "Big Face," I didn't say much because of the word count; I hope Mr. He Ru can continue to find "the musical instruments accompanied by Big Face singing and dancing" and quickly break out of the scope of "I guess."</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Photo Album (Continued)</p>
<p>Fourteen</p>
<p>"Spoiling! What does that mean?" Carrot Top asked Little Pierre, who was pampered by his mother.</p>
<p>After roughly understanding what it was about, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"As for me, what I hope is to dip my fingers in the leftover fried sweet potato crumbs in the pot again and suck on the half of the peach with the pit."</p>
<p>He thought for a moment:</p>
<p>"If Mrs. Lepic gives me affectionate caresses, she will definitely start with the abacus beads."</p>
<p>Fifteen</p>
<p>Sometimes, sister Ernestine and brother Felix, tired of playing, voluntarily lent their toys to Carrot Top. He took a portion of each of their happiness and humbly put together his own happiness.</p>
<p>Because he was afraid they would ask him to return them, he dared not show that he was happy.</p>
<p>Sixteen</p>
<p>Carrot Top: So, don't you think my ears are too long?</p>
<p>Mathilde: I think your ears are very strange; would you lend them to me? I want to fill them with some sand to play with desserts.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: If Mom burns them first, the sand will be roasted in there.</p>
<p>Seventeen</p>
<p>"Won't you stop? Let me hear it again! So, between me and your father, who do you like more?" Mrs. Lepic said everywhere.</p>
<p>"I stand still, I don't say anything, I can swear to you, I don't like either of you," Carrot Top answered in his heart.</p>
<p>Eighteen</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: What are you doing, Carrot Top?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: I don't know, Mom.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: That means you're doing something unconsciously again. Are you doing it on purpose?</p>
<p>Carrot Top: That's the only thing I lack.</p>
<p>Nineteen</p>
<p>Carrot Top thought his mother was smiling at him, very happy, so he smiled along.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Lepic, who was vaguely smiling to herself, suddenly turned her face stern, like a black wooden head with two black raspberry-like eyes embedded in it.</p>
<p>Flustered, Carrot Top didn't know where to run.</p>

<h3>Human Misfortune</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Whether "science" will be "beneficial" or "harmful" to the future life of mankind is a mystery that even Liu Bowen reborn or Zhuge Liang resurrected would find difficult to "foresee."</p>
<p>"Telephones" inevitably require switchboard operators. However, after telephone companies upgraded to "automatic telephones," the "rice bowls" of a large number of switchboard operators have become a pile of "broken pieces."</p>
<p>In the past, in the early morning and evening, we could often see male and female workers from various factories riding "wheelbarrows" back and forth. Since the advent of "fast, cheap, and accessible" trams, the "wheelbarrows" have changed from transporting "people" to mainly transporting "goods." But now, larger companies and firms have their own "trucks for transporting goods," and the lives of "wheelbarrow pullers" are gradually approaching "the setting sun."</p>
<p>"Foreign cloth" is not only delicate and smooth but also cheap. Therefore, farmers in rural China who grow their own cotton and weave their own cloth can only carry the cloth to the city and back home, worrying about the rice jar. After the invention of scientific dyeing and weaving methods, the Chinese silk industry plummeted, and silk workers experienced great panic.</p>
<p>The Indian national father Mahatma Gandhi advocated "homespun cloth" and cursed "science," which seemed to be reversing the trend of the times. But if we put aside the pleasures of "wine" and "meat" and think deeply, if some "scientific product" were to take away the work you rely on to earn bread, then what would your "life" be like? Even if you have a "scientific mind," you can't help but doubt "science."</p>
<p>This is not a joke. According to the current "rate of scientific progress," any complex task can be performed by things without "nerves." For example, the police officers who manage "vehicle traffic" at intersections can reportedly be replaced by custom-made "puppets."</p>
<p>"Robots" can already fly airplanes, safely flying from Los Angeles to New York. With this kind of evolution, is there still a "way out" for humanity? Although we are now enjoying a lot of benefits from "science," the "misfortune" of mankind is probably about to come!</p>
<h3>Summer Night in the Park</h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>The gentle evening breeze took away the heat of the early summer in this southern country. The park, shrouded in the golden setting sun, was filled with a sweet atmosphere.</p>
<p>Trees stretched out their arms, standing like a green gauze umbrella. Birds chirped and sang, fluttering their clever tongues, red, black, yellow... Wildflowers, revealing their fresh and delicate beauty, secretly peeked at the naked thighs in the long cheongsams.</p>
<p>There were passionate Parisian girls, red jackets, white short skirts, golden hair, dancing with flowing sleeves. There were petite Japanese girls, three or four with high buns, white necks, and colorful clothes, with a bright bag on their shoulders, wooden clogs clattering in symphony. There were Indian women, wearing long shawls that reached the ground, large breasts shaking in their loose clothing, earrings, rings, bracelets, flashing golden light, descendants of the noble titles of a fallen kingdom!</p>
<p>Young people held the white, tender, round arms of modern girls, their long trousers lightly passing over the green grass. The wind carried the fragrance of their lover's flesh and powder, kissing the faces of the young people, their feathery steps treading lightly, circling along the grassy path, or sitting under the green shade, talking and laughing, happy, without worry, without pain!</p>
<p>The ice cream shop was temporarily decorated in a modern style, like prostitutes who put on makeup and go out to sell their bodies at night. The waiters put on brand-new uniforms, smiling and waiting for customers.</p>
<p>The music pavilion shone with white-hot lights, the large bass drum raising its hoarse voice, roughly, harmonizing with the other musical sounds, playing a summer tune.</p>
<p>The moon had just risen from the east, faintly, the night shrouded the entire garden, blurring all the outlines, only the delicate laughter still rippled in the sparsely moonlit green shade.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on a Visit to Liwa Lida Village</h3>
<p>— Geng Bai</p>
<p>A path through the woods is right at the door, the flowers and plants are sparse and the mood is naturally warm. It is not necessary to seek coolness, the snowy sky and moonlit ground doubles the dissipation of melancholy.</p>
<p>From afar, I hear the sound of a sawing board, like the rustling of wind and waves. The birds sing in the deep shade of the tung trees, who knows my feelings at this moment? (Last line borrowed)</p>
<p>The golden land needs rain, walking can make [?]</p>
<p>The mood is special. The sense of poverty and wealth comes and goes in my heart, and I have not burned the book due to the unfair climate.</p>
<p>There is also gentle wave with green shade, sunset like an orange the writing has just begun to sink. But I seek the taste of Xuanwu Lake, washing away the heart of the traveler day and night.</p>
<p>Why does the wind cicada bring sorrow, small years and shallow waves. It seems that my focus is a mistake, there is not much to say in the world.</p>
<p>Four people strolled leisurely in pairs, dancing pavilions and sparse fences on both sides of the shore. Clearly seen are the new [?] artifacts, ten thousand crows writing Shenzhou like ink!</p>
<h3>Robot Sketches</h3>
<p>— Hutou</p>
<p>I had just written this topic when a friend next to me laughed and said: "What is there to sketch about robots? They always get off at the New World, like the clerks of the Three Companies. There is also a Frenchman who, when he gets on the car, looks around, first at the people in the car, as if to prevent pickpockets, after looking around, he sits down with his butt. He is not a clerk of the tram company, but a figure from the police station, because he never buys a ticket and sits in the first class. There used to be a large group of different people getting on at the Father Raos Station, but recently there are very few, sometimes even no one. The reason is that the houses are being rebuilt at Father Raos West Street, and these robots may have moved. Going north along the road is Rue Lafayette. At the intersection of Chengyu Lane, there is a modern miss, about seventeen or eighteen years old, who always gets on the car with a mister around thirty years old. It is not clear whether it is a black lacquered bench or what. Listening to their conversation, the girl is studying at the Nanyang Senior Commercial School, and the man slips away alone at the north end of the Great World. Recently, another miss in a blue cheongsam has been added to the Rue Lafayette station, with small eyes, and dimples on her face, often reflecting, especially when she opens her mouth to laugh. At the Taipingqiao station, there is a woman in her thirties and a pitifully thin man. This woman has a shiny bun and carries a paper bag in her hand, like a student's homework, getting on the car obediently, without any playful expression, and it is clear at a glance that she is a teacher somewhere. There is also a pitifully thin man, like my classmate, but I still can't be sure, so I have never greeted him; sometimes he wears a suit, sometimes he wears a long gown. Looking at his face, it seems that he has severe lung disease, if not the third stage, then the second stage, but he is still engaged in the robot life. From here to Cale Road, and Nanyang Bridge [?]. Why do you have to rack your brains to earn a few manuscript fees? This is really unnecessary, unnecessary!" I said: "Wait, wait! The robots I am talking about are not made of wood, nor are they made by machines, but their work and rest are at a certain time, like a machine that is wound up and always moves accordingly, and they are still people with flesh and blood and bones. Therefore, the 'Robot Sketches' are sketches of all kinds of people." [title explanation]</p>
<p>Those of us live a dull life every day, which is very boring. But one thing is also very interesting, that is, many people will meet you at the same time without prior arrangement. Although they are all strangers, they seem to have become acquaintances just because they meet every day. So I have the need to describe each of the unfamiliar him and her.</p>
<p>I live in Xieqiao, Nanshi, and work in Meibaige Road. Trolleybus No. 18 is my good friend "I can't live without this gentleman" . Along the way with me: there are misses, there are also misters. I take the bus around 8:30 in the morning. At the same time, two or three people get on at Kangti Road, one is a miss in a fashionable cheongsam, not very high heels, with a thin layer of powder on her face. No, Zhujiaqiao, Ningbo Road, Baxianqiao, Great World: although people get on and off, there is no certainty, so they cannot be regarded as robots. Probably this area is a display of fleshy bodies, the place of origin of waxberries, so robots are not worthy of living in it.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Ten</p>
<p>Hearing the words, Fangxin was shocked that the wish to be ennobled was distant</p>
<p>Listening to the song, he envied the color and leisurely served the country</p>
<p>Mr. Niu, you tell me, marrying such a soldier, am I enjoying happiness while he is alive? Or am I enjoying happiness after he dies? He left behind two boys and one girl, and I have to raise them. Over the years, not to mention the clothes and food for myself and the children, I also have to provide for the children to study. What am I marrying a husband for? It is simply paying off debts from a previous life. Guizhi couldn't help but gasp in her heart after hearing what he said. So this is the fate of marrying a soldier. Sitting on the kang, pressing her hands on the kang mat, she stared at Aunt Liu's face, stunned. Mr. Niu also pressed his hands on his knees, looking at Aunt Liu's face, shaking his head a few times and saying, "Suddenly seeing the willow color at the head of the tomb, regretting teaching my husband to seek nobility." As the saying goes, "Don't laugh at me drunk on the battlefield, how many have returned from ancient battles?" Guizhi and Aunt Liu didn't understand what he was saying and didn't pay attention to him. Mr. Niu was feeling awkward because someone was complaining to him, so he said to Aunt Liu, "Sister-in-law, did you ask me to come here to say something?" Aunt Liu exclaimed, laughed, and said, "Look, I'm just talking and delaying the serious business." As she said this, she sighed again, "To tell you the truth, this child's father, although we were separated more than we met, we had a very good relationship. Tomorrow is his birthday, I always remember. When I think of his good points, I want to burn two paper packages for him. I'm asking you for nothing else, just to write two paper package covers." The more Guizhi heard these words, the more she felt creepy. These words were nothing but more and more unbearable to hear. She really didn't want to listen anymore, so she said, "Aunt Liu, I have something to do, I don't want to sit anymore, please give me the pills." Aunt Liu didn't dare to keep her for long because the woman's mother was sick, so she had to give her the pills and let her go back. Guizhi walked home, her face was unusually pale. Without saying a word, she put the small package of pills she brought back on the table. Seeing the clothes her mother hadn't finished making on the kang, she picked up the needle and thread and sat down to start sewing. (116)</p>
