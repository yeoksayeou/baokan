<h3 id="c6">日本廣田外交之所謂新方針實 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>對歐美外交轉變對華如旣定步驟</p>
<p>日本前外相内田之（焦士外交。）外受國際間之非難。内遇軍閥之掣肘。遂不能不借口病軀衰老而去職。代内田而興之廣田。號稱（道理外交。）首先更改（焦土化）之惡名。然其實廣田上臺之先。即已與軍部取得確切之諒解。吾人試觀荒木對廣田就任所發表之談話。已顯然言明廣田將仍舊蹈襲内田之外交方針。海軍亦同此意。然則廣田氏之所謂日本新外交方針。究何如耶。總核廣田氏自己所聲明之要點如下。</p>
<p>清算日本退出國際聯盟以後之孤立外交。</p>
<p>打開列强對日本之經濟的圍攻。</p>
<p>切實準備第二次華盛頓海軍會議。</p>
<p>解决蘇日間種種糾紛。</p>
<p>對華政策。一成不變。僅就人事上用工夫。且積極扶助滿洲（傀儡）之獨立。</p>
<p>上述諸端就表面看。似甚言之有理。并確有轉變傾向。惟吾人試一考察日本過去之外交。即知内田外交之所以碰壁。固由於不顧事實。一味　頇。而又任從軍部操縱。較從前之所謂二重外交。尤爲横暴。彼在國際方面。認武力爲萬能。以爲歐美皆無暇東顧。我國又實力未充。正可乘時趁火打刦。國聯之公决。可以推翻。我國公理之要求。更可不顧。卒成就其退出國聯之願望。然而彼單獨之外交。果又何如乎。彼之初意。以爲英國爲日本之舊同盟。聯英制美。不成問題。蘇聯又爲衆矢之的。日本可隨意左右。美國亦正震盪於經濟恐慌狂潮中。日本即使外交孤立。又何所害。豈知英日經濟闗係。早處於對立之尖端。印度等後進國家之纖維工業。亦勃然興起以與日競賽。日本在經濟上已處於四面楚歌之勢。於是所謂單獨外交者眞成爲孤立外交矣。此時雖悔脫退國聯之非計。寗有及哉。</p>
<p>自自由貿易變爲極端保護主義而後。渥大華會議。所　確定大英帝國經濟聯盟。美國所以發　產業復興計劃。皆運用政治上之組織力。以推動經濟之停滯。就純經濟立塲論。尙且不免含有極濃厚之排外主義。以國際闗係論。更帶有嚴重的軍事意味。日本兩年來之行爲。匪特欲重新分割東亞市塲。且將進而西窺印度。東蝕南美。英美安得不急起自衛。日本苟不放棄其侵略政策。則對歐美雖高倡轉換外交。又有何益。日蘇糾紛。不止北洋漁塲東北國境而已。其最大廠結。亦在於日軍閥之侵略東三省。扶助傀儡。加以中東路問題。日本必欲唆使傀儡。肆行掠奪。是以日蘇之間。僅存表面上必不得已之外交闗聯。而欲圖問題之解决難矣。</p>
<p>中國之與日本。在地理上爲鄰國。在歷史上有淵。源然而近二十年來。日本除努力侵略外。絶無絲毫誠意修好之表示。至九一八更釀成我中國民族不可疏解之仇恨。今者日本外務當局易人。欲僅恃人事上之闗係。憑個人友誼之周旋。以解决兩國間之民族糾紛。豈可得哉。矧廣田上台。即已聲明對華外交方針。决無變更。東北四省仍舊强占。則中日間之外交僵局。殊無法打開。對歐美之新方針。即亦恐無從實現。然則廣田外交。仍不過依附軍部。蹈襲内田之故轍。所謂（道理外交）正如焦土外交之名異實同而已。</p>

<p>怎麽紀念九一八</p>
<p>抗日應注重實行</p>
<p>濟南通信、馮玉祥自察事結束再度到泰安後、對於抗日救國、未渝初志、近馮氏以九一八慘痛紀念、瞬屆二週、特發表（怎麽紀念九一八二文、照錄如次、</p>
<p>九一八事變至今、已兩週年了、雖然國都遷回南京、政府人員的薪金恢復了原狀、表面上彷彿又呈現了昇平氣象、然東三省失地、固然未曾收復、反失掉了熱河榆闗塘沽恊定成立後、灤東名曰接收、而日人干涉剿匪、興隆縣所屬地在長城綫外者、日人亦不許過問、公開表示長城綫爲滿洲國界、這些都是各報上已載的顯然事實、這些事實、確切證明現在的困難、比去年的今日更深了、困難愈深而一切反應愈加沉寂、抵貨備戰抗日等說、俱如烟雲一般的漸漸幻滅了、這實在是我國的大危機、在失地未規復以前、凡我國民均應負有抗日的責任、負有國事重責者、更不用說了、不管抗日的方法是怎樣、長期抵抗、也好、（一面抵抗一面交涉一也好、總之不可把（抵抗）二字抛棄而抵抗）二字、更重在實行、須有事實擺在同胞的面前、不然、必形成以（抵抗）爲口頭禪、徒自欺欺人耳、我是自始至終主張抗日的、尤其主張武力抗日、所以我必須實踐找的主張、在平津危急之時、我爲熱河的愛國心的騙使、不度力量不避艱危、收集志士、以求與日僞一戰、期由保全察境、收復失地、以爲天下倡、經數次血戰、傷亡忠勇戰士達一千六百餘人、幸將實昌·康保·沽源·多倫等地、先後克復、致引起日僞漢奸、誣我以赤化割據等名詞、企圖擾亂國際視聽、及啟我國糾紛、我不過志切抗日、對内當然力求和平、又承政府當道汪蔣諸公、告我以抗日中央自有整個計畫、當爲旣謂有整個抗日計畫我輩雖不知其内容如何、爲避免國内糾紛計、不能不退而聽政府實施其整個計　、所以於八月六日、將一切軍政等權、完全交與政府、可是在這實際的抗日奮鬥中、我得着了幾點認識、（一）民衆與士兵確是志切抗日的、在國難嚴重期中、而抗日空氣、反爲沉寂、於是便是資難一般民衆與軍人者、其實不然、民衆與士兵、確爲愛國者、此次收復察東、在食宿無所的荒漠中、抗日同盟軍、無往而不受民衆歡迎與帮助作我軍嚮導也、擾亂日僞軍後方也、莫不爭先恐後、至作戰之同盟軍由各零星抗日部隊臨時編制而成、衣食不周、國彈俱缺、處淋雨之中、徒步荒漠之野、然一聞進攻之令、靡不奮身効死、可見軍心民心、俱有抗日熱忱、其抗日空氣所以銷沉者、不過未與以表現之機會耳、（二）抗日戰爭、須有計畫、指揮統一、長城戰役、我數十萬大軍非不忠勇、然而失敗者、無計盡與指揮統一、恐爲一大原因、此次克復察東、我兵力不及長城戰役者遠甚、且亦係各軍合組、非某一個整個系統之軍隊、然而奏效者、其原因固多、如就作戰而論、卽較爲有計畫、而指揮統一也、所以我於歌日發電交還一切政權後、軍分會宣稱多倫十三日又失陷、想軍政交替時、作戰無統一之指揮亦爲一失敗之重要原囚也、就以上觀察、抗日空氣雖沉寂、而民衆愛國之心、並不淡漠、抗日之戰雖失敗、而並非完全不可一戰、政府屢云抗日、自有計　、當爲我全國同胞所馨香頂祝、似乎於國難危急、並非無自救之道、所重者在實行耳、</p>
<p>所以我们現在紀念九一八、不在乎口舌之辯、應當抗日、已爲國人所共知、今後當在大家確定抗日方法、身體力行、縱然有若干顧慮與障碍、只要能夠始終不懈、盡一分抗日力量、自有一分、日成績、不然、事實昭然、卽善於自辯、亦不能飾其非也、過去我對於抗日計畫、向政府已有屢次的建議、各界人士、亦有不少的名言　論、可是現在失地愈多、國勢愈弱、而九一八紀念已到了兩週年、所以我以爲現在紀念九一八、是在（抗日的實行）、凡是我以前說過的話、如整頓國防、收復失地、抵貨等、就不再重述了、不過實行抗日期中、武備固然須當講求、而政治方面尤應抗刷新、在民衆方面、應當本大無畏的精神、互相團結、監督政府、共除漢奸、以達到抗日精神、在政府方面、對民衆應當使其盡量發表抗日意見、盡量發展抗日力量、對外交財政、均須完全公開、而後可釋羣疑、可得民衆之擁護、對國民經濟、應力求復興、不可任帝國主義漫無邊際之經濟侵略、或甚至代其暢銷剩餘樀品、對政治應力求肅清貪污、整飭綱紀、此皆目前必須之最低限改革、不如是、國將不國何足以言抵抗、縱有最擴之會議最冠寃之演辭、亦不足以紀念九一八的、而九一八之恥、將年甚一年、直至捲入世界第二次大戰中、隨國家以俱亡、吾輩縱發言盈庭大於國奚益　所以紀念九一八、須在一抗日</p>

<p>昨日公開參觀</p>
<p>工程確極偉大</p>
<p>國人作何感想</p>
<p>在滬日海軍陸戰隊本部、自一二八事變後、行動益趨積極、將舊有兵營拆除、仍在北四川路底、虹口公園對面原址、改建一最新式堅固之永久大兵營、於去年十一月間、開始興工、本月初全部告成、復於西側路旁、蓋一軍醫院、亦於同時完工日陸戰隊當局、特於昨日下午二時、公開接待中外各報社記者、允許自由前往參觀、並引導至各層表面參觀一週工程確極偉大、惟走馬看花、在此一刹那間殊無以窺其堂奥、軍事秘密更談不到矣、詳情如下、</p>
<h3 id="c137">底層一瞥 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>記者等於午後二時餘　　、驅車往北四川路底　　於日本海軍陸戰隊本　　部之門前下車、持槍鵲立之門崗、操日语詢是否報館記者、即由一傳達兵士逐一收取名剌、招待入一室略候、記者入室、先凭窗察視其建築之輪廓、巍峨雄偉之四層建築物、其式樣略如南京路九江路問之大陸商塲、惟爲三面環繞式、中間一廣場、可容兵數百作縱横操演、底層所置大致爲鐵甲車·坦克車·輕砲車·機槍·機脚車·軍用運輸車·軍用汽車等、時正有大批運輸車載來無數長方木箱、外表宛日陸戰隊新營房（李尊庸攝）</p>
<p>如軍中之　棺　由數百兵士逐一缷下汽車搬往樓上、據日記者言兵士臥具綑紮後、每三副置一木箱中、白日即作爲桌椅之用運輸亦極方便、此數百兵士方由日來滬、即將轉往漢口者也、</p>
<h3 id="c138">逐層參觀 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>正觀察間、傳達兵請來西裝便服之通譯官柏木節君、鞠躬致意、招待登樓、扶梯可容五六人並行、水泥梯階、平坦異常、銅梗扶手、内部形式、爲環繞式之走廊、亦頗寛廣、西面俱爲内屋、司令官以下、參謀處等重要人員之辦公室舍室、俱在第一層、第二三層逐漸爲中下級官佐士兵等宿舍、沿馬路四週、所開窗户甚小、度其牆則奇厚、殊非砲彈之力所能熾、記者等由通譯官領導下走馬看花、不暇詳察、有數處之門形如閘、加巨可大之鎖、不測其内藏何物、門外亦無標識、亦無從窺其神奥也、</p>
<h3 id="c139">屋頂瞭望 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>最後至屋頂、廣可容　　數千人、下級士兵、坐　　陽光下操作雜務甚勤、記者自一二八以後、歷次視察日兵内部、均有此種印象、未有如我國軍中飽食無事後之無聊消遣者、瞭望台即建於是、頂懸旭日之旗迎風招颭、臺頂一日兵、實行其瞭望工作、其高度自地面計算、聞爲一百呎、瞭望臺旁建神社、供兵士膜拜者、方由二三我同胞工人爲之葺治、尙未竣工式樣　小、乃砌成假山形、再建一木商於上耳、神社之旁、爲紀念一二八碑、上有碑文曰、（上海陸戰隊招魂社）、下署（七月七日元帥伯爵東鄉平八郎書立、）蓋日本之東鄉元帥書、以纪念一二八殲於十九路軍之陸戰隊士也、</p>
<h3 id="c140">謂無秘密 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>逐層參觀已畢、由一　　出入口下樓、所置高　　射機槍一如彼初登屋　　頂之處、因悟平坦堅厚之屋、固不僅可以機槍高射飛機、即安置數門重砲、廻旋自如、盡力摧毁此大上海亦何難哉、下樓後在底層應接室中、憇坐、汽水一杯、紙烟數枝、通譯官隨意答客問、先任參謀角田、雖除日語外、一無所　、亦代表司令衫板與中外記者來賓周旋、握手行禮甚忙、據渠與通譯官柏木節云、並無所謂地層建築、亦决無秘密存在云云、</p>

<p>屋頂有收音之無線電　　桿、地上電線縱横密　　佈、蓋尙未全部裝竣　　也、天井之上空、電線吏密如蜘網、下層左側有一室、爲電信總收發處、亦正在裝置各種機械、門外並貼有嚴禁入内之日文字樣、想見其通信網之嚴密、又士兵之生活、完全合於科學化、入食堂時、雙手須消毒洗凈、對於體育之訓練、更爲嚴格、特設有運動室、摔角室等、紀律嚴肅、殊足爲吾人師法也、</p>
<h3 id="c142">附屬醫院 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>記者等旣辭出、復承　　角田參謀之美意、導　　過黄陸路赴同時落成　　之海軍醫院視察、該建築亦爲四層、唯地位則甚狹仄、佔地才數畝、與大兵營相較、有大小巫之概、由最下一層爲事務藥劑診療手術等室、逐層而上、分設花柳·眼科·齒科·傳染病·等療室、及大小病室數十、屋雖新建、然大小病房中巳臥床濟濟、記者察見其壁間所書通告、及看護之報告、與病房人滿之現象相印證、則日本報紙所傳上海陸戰隊患赤痢病多之說、並非虚語也、</p>
<h3 id="c143">建築經過 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>日兵營房屋成長方式　　之口字形、佔地約計　　五十餘畝、高凡四層、　　全舍可容五六千人、中有廣塲、可作操練之用在北四川路竇樂安路口之頂層有一瞭望台在焉、高約六十餘英尺可作指揮全軍作戰之用、該營自去年十一月間動工興築、以迄落成、費時僅六閱月、兵營圖樣係由日本海軍省繪製、並派專員及技師來滬監工興築、一切材料、均由海軍省特派運輸艦運滬、不取運費、不徵捐稅、然需價已達日金一百五十萬元以上矣、病院之房屋高亦四層、設備完全、需價亦鉅、記者歸而書此、不覺百感交涉、手顫而心裂矣、</p>

<h3 id="c239">最完美的低週率放大 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>李元慶</p>
<p>現在收音機常用的低週率放大，大概可分爲三種：</p>
<p>（一）電阻交連放大　此種放大，佔據地位旣小，成本又低，同時又因爲所採用的是無感電阻，（Ｎonindnctive　resis</p>
<p>tance）牠的數值，在任何週率時，都能保持常數，所以得到的音質，最是清楚。但是牠本身没有放大作用，如果欲得到宏大的音量，必須增加放大的級數，這是牠的缺點。</p>
<p>（二）變壓器交連放大　現在使用最普遍的低週率放大，要算是變壓器交連了。牠能以小量的電力，獲得狠大的放大倍數。但是低週率變壓器的磁感量。（Ｉ</p>
<p>nductance）是與通過的直流電成反比的，電流大，磁感量便要減低，如果電流超過規定的數值，變壓器的鐵心便要飽和。（Ｓaturation）結果在音質方面，便有很大的影響。</p>
<p>（三）推挽式放大　要得到巨大而又不失眞的聲音，那就非用推挽式放大不可。不過堆挽式放大，耗電很多，小規模的收音機，是不常使用的。</p>
<p>此外還有一種呌做扼制圈放大，牠的形式，作用都和電阻放大相似，現在使用該種放大方式的收音機很少，故從略。</p>
<p>低週率放大，在收音機中佔着很重要的地位，設計時偶一不慎，足以影響全機的効率。因此，在裝置前，便不能不格外的審慎。</p>
<p>本文所介紹的低週率放大，是利用濾波（Ｆilter）的原理而設計的。牠將電阻交連與變壓器交連混合爲一，（原文名Ｒesistancefed　Transformer　Coupli</p>
<p>ng）結果雙方的優點都給牠一手抓住，同時却將雙方的缺點儘量排除。</p>
<p>如圖，Ｒ爲五十萬歐姆之電阻，Ｃ爲ol　mtd之電容器，Ｔ爲常用之低週率變壓器。（Ｂ十改接Ｂ一）使用時屏路直電流僅在Ｒ處通過，變壓器初級線圈通過的，祗是顫動的低週率電流。變壓器旣無直流電通過，牠的磁感量便能不變，同時更可避免飽和之患，因此，得到的聲浪，不僅是非常清楚，并且在音量方面，還能比較單用變壓器交連者爲大。</p>
<p>我们知道，變壓器的初級線團，最是容易燒壞，但是如果採用了上述的方法，那麽，線圈内便没有直流電通過，這樣當然可以减少此種損失。這一個特點，也有附帶說明的必要。</p>
<h3 id="c240">短波發射機之調準法及其步驟（續）羅靜予 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>下篇　復振盪式發射機調準之步驟爲使週率穏定起見，在電力較大遠距通信的電臺，常採用復振盪式的發射機。譬如上海現在的國際電臺楓林橋等處，都是用的這一種式子。</p>
<p>所謂復振盪式發射機，前面巳經講過，就是藉一個小眞空管來發生振盪，然後再藉若干級的放大，始交付天線。所以復振盪式，第一可免去因眞空管屏極電力太大熱度過高之屏極電容量的變化，第二可免去因天線部份直接交連於振盪線路的影響。不過在今日最流行的復振盪式，其振盪之產生，却並不用屏流回抵栅極的方法，而是利用晶石（Ｃrystal）來發生一種定性的振盪，其情形有如第四圖，當ＬＣ之本身週率與晶石石英諧振時，便有相當的電量至栅電路，而使石英振盪；石英旣起振盪，則ＬＣ之週率雖有變更，亦不影響於石英的振盪週率。至其週率的大小，純是依着他的厚薄來决定，愈短愈薄的，其週率便愈高；不過，普通在短波中應用的，求其有適當厚薄的方法，是非常困難。於是便有一種倍週器的應用。譬如我们欲發二十公尺，倘石英之振盪週率爲一八七五千週（一百六十公尺）則經第一倍週器後變成三七五○千週（八十公尺）復經第二到第三才變成一五○○千週，（廿公尺）故今日新型的發射機，其組織大多具着下例的程序：</p>
<p>圖中第一級爲石英控制的振盪器，其週率爲Ｆ，第二級呌做緩衝放大（Ｂnffer　Ampilfy），即將原來之Ｆ再加以擴大，使其愈爲穏定。然後第三第四及第五均爲倍週器，將週率數目倍增城８Ｆ。第六第七即將第五倍週後之８Ｆ，加以强力放大（Ｐower　Ampl）</p>
<p>ify）而付諸天線向外發射。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c241">眞空管裹有些什麽子敬 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>眞空管的名詞已經很普遍了，我们顧名思義便可知道眞空管是什麽也没有的玻璃管。但，眞空管并不眞空，事實告訴我们，這管裹的的確確還有多到我们不能想像的東西。</p>
<p>假使現在有一個五时眞徑的圓玻璃球，她裹面的空氣已用抽氣機抽到相當的程度，換句話說，可以說是眞空了。然而這玻璃管裹面還有下列的好些東西：</p>
<p>（一）氮分子　二八八·三○○·○○○·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>（二）氣分子　七七·六○○·○○○·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>（三）　分子　三·四五○·○○○·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>（四）二氣化炭分子　六四四·○○○·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>（五）氤分子　四·四七○·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>（六）　分子　二五·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>（七）　分子　五·○○○·○○○個</p>
<p>而且雖然有三六九，九九八，四九五，○○○，○○○個分子在這管裹活動，可是並不覺得擁擠，至於球内的氣壓，僅不過大氣壓的百萬分之一百。要是球内的氣壓等於大氣壓，那末將有二八，九八八，四二三，五二○，○○○，○○○，○○○個分子存在。所以直到現在爲止，在這世界上，還没有絶對的眞空管。</p>

<p>（五）製造防濕木丨丨木頭的密度較小，容易吸收水分，若製造無線電機的外箱，常常因爲空氣太潮濕，以致收音不佳，最好將木板先塗匀以下的藥品：Ａ法：氯化鋅的飽和溶液，</p>
<p>Ｂ法：硼酸六份，氯化錏五分，硼砂三分，加水一百份，</p>
<p>以上二種方法任選一種去做，等完全乾燥以後：再塗上漆，就可以阻止濕氣的吸收。</p>
<p>（六）磨光廢唱片丨丨將廢唱片（即留聲機片）裁好，先用粗砂，磨平細紋，後用細砂紙磨擦，再用布蘸胡麻子油向一方面磨擦，直到磨光爲止，硬橡皮或膠板，也可依照此法磨光，但是免去用粗砂紙去紋那一層手續，</p>
<p>（七）滑劑丨丨肥皂塗在鋸條上，鋸木的時候可不澀，塗在螺絲釘上·就容易旋在木頭裹，並且拆缷時也很容易，（八）清潔銼刀丨丨用銼刀銼五金或是木料膠板時，那銼屑就聚集在銼齒上，因爲這個原故，銼刀容易鈍，最好在使用以前，將粉筆塗粉銼齒，用完以後，浸在稀酸性液裹要半點鐘工夫，（若是聚在齒上是木屑或是膠板屑，就用稀硫酸：若是五金屑，就用稀鹽酸，）取出以後，用凈水冲一遍，再用鹹水洗多次，乾燥以後，用塗油的布磨擦，如此不但不損銼齒，還能越使越快。（完）</p>

<p>接頭放冷之後，把露銅的地方塗以油漆或樹膠以防走電，然後便可應用丨所用火燄，二十八號到三十號用汽爐，三十到四十用酒精燈，四十號以上的用蠟燭火丨</p>

<p>前些時，日本人紛紛組織（滿蒙視察　），（滿蒙調查隊），從事東西省的調查工作。這一程子，巳見到了很多的報告。山川，河流，森林，礦產，農產，漁牧，民情，户口，地質，經濟，敎育，氣候等等，詳細　遺。但是我们從前讀中國旅行家的遊記，只知道在東北某處出產某種奇魚，味頗鮮美，某處出產某種異鳥，可供製作　飾。某處的婚俗，盛行一妻多夫制，某處的男女，都是喜歡野合的。有些所在，以牛羊易妻，有些所在，更可夜宿不相識的人家，而淫其妻女。</p>
<p>但是調查這些奇風異俗的中國旅行家，究竟還算是比較的有些意義。在都會裘，儘有無數洋塲才子，以及儋褵高等華人，專以調查某校花，某皇后，昨夜在某處開棧房，某姨太，某明星，這一程子合某人發生闗係等事情，那才是不知所云呢。</p>
<h3 id="c247">記一個鄉農的話 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>前天有一個某鄉農，年已垂老，清晨在法華塔下泡了一壺茶，他自言自語的說道，這一回來了一個（收花客人，）眞是厲害啊！（吾邑嘉定俗諺，呌颶風當收花客人，因棉花被風吹落無餘，故有此名，）說了，還歎幾口氣，滿肚的怨恨着，停了半晌，他繼續高聲又說道，吾輩種田人，總是靠天喫飯，無奈天公不肯照應，就是下了本錢，盡了勞力，唉！只消得大風大雨刮喇喇一吹，那末，雪白的棉花田·朶朶是銅鈿（照鄉農口氣）遂會化了烏有，平日眼巴巴望着要捉滿兩担好花，（在田中采花鈴，呌捉花，）那裹曉得偏是空快活，唉！直呌是天養人，天不肯養人，人也無從去求天來援救，說罷，看他還欷歔不已！</p>
<p>吾聽了，也不由得心弦上動彈起來，就向他問一聲，你丨老人家自那一鄉到此，他說吾自東鄉來，丨東鄉這回遭了風災怎樣？丨唉丨不要說起，今年棉花，初起看來，要算大熟年成了，不料被大風吹了一晝夜，又被一陣一陣的大雨，遂致風吹雨打，棉花萁上的盧都，（盧都兩字，本番語，即花鈴，吾邑至今仍之，）本來每棵至少有十餘個，多至三十餘個，可稱三十年來所未見，現在呢丨到田裹去一望，大半墮落在泥土上面，倘不遭災，巳可捉到手裹，就算有賸了少數，不過也是微弱無力，變成黄花，將來總賣不起錢，這眞是絶大的損失，比之民二十年的災况，有過之無不吸哩丨</p>
<p>聽他這一番話，吾以爲值得再問個明白，就問他，今年各鄉棉花，本來那一處最好，他說，最好要算東南二鄉，北鄉較次，西鄉又次了，東鄉截至上月底，最多巳有捉到六七十斤的，平均計算，總在三四十斤左右，如其晴雨不致失調，大有豐收的希望，嘉定農作，向來是（棉七稻三，）大約以六十萬畝計，再折至四十萬畝棉田，這一回受災，估量眞是不少？棉箕每棵，只須有花鈴四箇，一畝就可收花兩担，今年不遭風雨，不要說别樣，（今年產自田中者皆豐收，）一些花，也喫牢了。（鄉農口氣，吃牢者，言穏定之意，）吾又問他棉花這樣，禾稻能不受損傷麽？他說，禾稻因種植得較晚，所以還好，現正在（做肚）（做肚，即莖中營養方盛之際，）尙未開花，　以後　有大風和大雨，這是（禾稻只怕風來擺，）那眞倒楣了丨余聽了覺得他老人家，確是經騐的說話，就吆喝一聲，拉着走了，同時，　觀　衆的拍掌聲和笑聲，算是歡送。</p>
<p>五步，第一映射到　　的，就是用粉筆寫的（露天舞台）四個特大的空心字，筆姿倒很猷勁。這比三步所見的規模要大的多，拉的唱的敲的一共有七八個人，而且還有許多自製的冠袍髯帶，不過，戲館演員面上塗的是色彩，他们却是籠單着烟油。</p>
<p>六步，一羣花花彩彩的少女在乘凉，在貯望未歸的人，不，都不，伊们是肉的出賣者，正在等候着主雇，有幾處，竟合夥兒强迫地實行伊们拉與推的手段。</p>
<p>七步，一個上等模樣的人，跳下黄包車時，因爲車夫說了怎樣的一旬話，就乾脆給他兩記耳光，銅子丨應給的代價丨擲散在地上·車夫彎着腰，一手捧臉一手拾·</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回　　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>他一直的將皮鞋響到大門口去，覺得自己是有些神經過敏，彼此之間，也不過剛有一點認識，這就談得到聞聲而來的愛情嗎？男子们談愛情，總是這樣的　呀。他如此想着，向前走時，一脚跨出了大門，却聽到身後有一種極不自然的細微咳聲。回頭看時，原來是桂枝站在大門外墻脚下。當人回頭看他的時候，他也就微笑着低了頭呢。趙自强心裹一活動，料着他一定是有意味站在這裹的，就立定了向他點了一個頭。桂枝回頭看看大門裹，然後才走近了一步，向趙自强低聲問道：剛才我们在乳茶舖裹的事情，你告訴了老太爺了嗎？趙自强頓了一頓，微笑道：没有，没有對他老人家說，桂枝道：你眞的没有說嗎？趙自强正色道：咱们以後還有話說呢，現在就說出來了，那也怪不好的不是？桂枝紅了臉道：我倒不是那樣說。因爲我的家庭，還是很舊的，要像黄小姐那樣子，家裹那會通得過？趙自强没甚可說的，連點着頭，說了幾聲是。桂枝笑道：我没有什麽話說了，你請罷。趙自强見他並不避進大門去，却呌自己走開，這裹當然是不願把脊梁朝人的意思·這一番情懷就深了。他心裹那一番笑意，也就莫明其妙的，一直湧上了臉，也低聲道：明天：明天，還是那乳茶舖，你瞧好嗎？桂枝沉吟了一會子，才笑着問道：你有什麽事要說嗎？趙自强站着想了一想，才笑道：我也没有什麽話要說，不過我想照着小田的話，每次回海甸來一次，最好我们在乳茶舖裹叙談叙談交換交換意見。桂枝什麽話也不說，只向他抿嘴笑了一笑。（一八八）</p>

<p>這是我出了ＸＸ弄口後開始第一步以至第十步中間所得到的十種不同的印象。</p>
<p>一步，一羣人圍着一隻很小的板桌，桌面兩頭黏有一紅一黑的兩塊，坐在中央的一個少年，僅用他的一隻左手撥弄他掌中的一個圓形的竹具，那人把那竹具表顯時，帮閒的人就跟着吆喝一陣，接着，便是鑑鏘的銀錢聲響，不過，這都是個大概，瞧得最仔細的，是一個站在桌前的婦人，不住的在掏伊的衣袋，頭額上的汗珠，巳無再綴的餘地，一時被擠軋下來的，晶瑩圓湛，眞像斷線珍珠一般。</p>
<p>二步，一個學生裝束，然而已很垢敝的青年，揑着一枝粉筆蹲在水門汀上不住地寫，寫，圍着瞧的人已有不少，並有三五個銅子疎疎地散佈在水門汀上。三步，一個鳩形的中年男子在拉胡琴，旁立一個十二三歳的小女子在唱。四步，巡警在一個路人的身畔，抄獲了一枚烟泡，相站着交話了一回·忽的攔住了一個鄉下人模樣的老者和那軍服少年絮絮講價·同時，左邊又來一個中年男子把他手中的摺照一揚，低聲問道：（春宫要否）？</p>
<p>孔老夫子嘗說：（十步之内，必有芳草·）這種眼福，當然令人羨慕的·不過，要使孔老夫子生在現代，他定不敢再說這樣肯定的話：特别是在上海，十步内的芳草，早成廣陵散了</p>

<p>— 旅隼</p>
<p>說禽獸交合是戀愛未免有點褻瀆。但是，禽獸也有性生活，那是不能否認的。牠们在春情發動期，雌的和雄的　在一起，難免（卿卿我我）的來一陣。固然。雌的有時候也　裝腔做勢，逃幾步又回頭看，還要呌幾聲，直到實行（同居之愛）爲止。禽獸的種類雖然多，牠们的（戀愛）方式雖然複雜，可是有一件事是没有疑問的：就是雄的不見得有什麽特權。</p>
<p>人爲萬物之靈，首先就是男人的本領大。最初，原是馬馬虎虎的，可是因爲（知有母不知有父）的緣故，娘兒们曾經（統治）過一個時期，那時候的祖老太太大概比後來的族長　要威風。後來不知怎的，女人就倒了霉：項頸上，手上，脚上，全都鎖上了練條，扣上了圈兒，環兒，丨雖則過了幾千年這些圈兒　兒大都已經變成了金的銀的，　上了珍珠實鑽，然而這些項圈，鐲子，戒指等等，到現在還是女奴的象徵。旣然女人成了奴隸，那就男人不必徵求她的同意再去愛）她了。古代部落之間的戰爭，結果俘虜會變成奴隸，女俘虜就會被强姦。那時候，大概春情發動期早就（取銷）了，隨時隨地男主人都可以强姦女俘虜，女奴隸。現代强盜惡棍之流的不把女人當人，其實是大有酋長式武士道的遗風的。</p>
<p>但是，强姦的本領雖然已經是人比禽獸（進化）的一步，究竟還只是半開化。你想，女的哭哭啼啼，扭手扭脚，能有多大興趣？自從金錢這寶貝出現之後，男人的進化就眞的了不得了。天下的一切都可以買賣，性慾自然並非例外。男人化幾個臭錢，就可以得到他在女人身上所要得到的東西。而且他可以給她說：我並非强姦你自願的，你願意拿這機個錢，你就得如此這般，百依百順，咱们是公平交易！蹂躪了她，還要她說一聲（謝謝你，大少）。這是禽獸幹得來的嗎？所以嫖妓是男人進化的頗高的階段了。</p>
<p>同時，父母之命媒灼之言的舊式婚姻，却要比嫖妓更高明。這制度之下，男人得到永久的終身的活財產。當新婦被人放到新郎的床上的時候，她只有義務，她連護價錢的自由也没有，何况戀愛。不管你愛不愛，在周公孔聖人的名義之下，你得從一而終，你得守貞操。男人可以隨時使用她，而她却要遵守聖賢的禮敎，卽使（只在心裹動了惡念，也要算犯奸淫一的。如果雄狗對雌狗用起這樣巧妙而嚴厲的手段來，雌的一定要急得（跳牆）。然而人却只會跳井，當節婦，貞女，烈女去。禮敎婚姻的進化意義，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>至於男人會用（最科學的）學說，使得女人雖無禮敎，也能心甘情願地專一而終，而且深信性慾是（獸慾），不應當作爲戀愛的基本條件；因此發明（科學的貞操），丨那當然是文明進化的頂點了。</p>
<p>嗚呼，人丨男人丨之所以異於禽獸者！</p>

<p>— 何如</p>
<p>胃病眞是一種可怕的病，尤其是和文人特别有緣。誰都知道蘇曼殊是因胃病不治而死，雖說做和尙，却好吃紅燒牛肉下酒，不守佛戒，死也是活該，但因他是一個國籍家世都弄不分明的漂泊文人，很引起了幾個文人的同情之感。再有羅黑芷，也是有胃病而死的，不過他兼患著心臓的病，所以他走起路來，不是皺眉捧心，便是苦臉捧腹。記得那是一九二八年的初春，一個剛從長沙來到南京的朋友告訴我說，羅黑芷死了丨驟然聽到這個不幸的消息，使我半晌說不出話來。我寫了一首悼他的小詩：</p>
<p>偷活人間亦苦辛，</p>
<p>燃將心火轉心輪。</p>
<p>曼殊不作晋思死，</p>
<p>又是江南春草生。</p>
<p>後來我又聽得黑芷的死，雖然本來有病，但因爲了一篇文章入獄，氣憤不過，出獄後不到幾天就死了，我再寫了一首悼他的小詩丨</p>
<p>願寫文章十萬言，</p>
<p>刳肝瀝血訴煩寃。</p>
<p>月如燈火花如筆，</p>
<p>長傍詩魂慰九原。</p>
<p>兩個月前，在樂嗣炳的病榻前，第一次看到彭家煌，他說盲腸火很危險，樂先生算平安了，他自己却是常患胃病的。我看他那種憔悴的面容，帶着很深的憂鬱的樣子，很有一點像黑芷·可是不曾料到他會快要死的。自然，湖南人患胃病並不希罕，因爲他们没有辣椒，辣得要出眼涙的辣椒，是不能下飯的。十年以前，我犯了一次很嚴重的胃病，臥在湘雅醫院，採用减食療法，捱餓差不多一個月，纔算餓好的，從此不敢吃辣椒了。兩三年來，覺得胃病將近十年不發了，看見同鄉的朋友，個個辣得有味，每和他们一道吃飯，總是喉嚨癢得怪　熬的，也就試試辣味了。同時因爲生活的苦辛，常常買醉忘憂，於是胃病又發作了。如今眼見彭家煌的死，又記起黑芷病中苦惱的情形，還想到朱劍帆胃癌的不可救治，胃病竟是這樣可怕的麽</p>

<p>錢先生說：（如果我们都有文學的天才，倒可以像日本的秋田雨雀一樣，改途易轍，去學Ｅsperanto　o）這並非事實，雖然莎士比亞普希金郭哥理歌德等的古典作品，世界語已有譯本，最近如（西線無戰事一，一怒吼吧，中國丨）等亦已譯成世界語，但是世界語的應用，並不限於（文學），孫中山的三民主義），世界語譯本已出一册，（列寗著作集一世界語版也已在編譯中了。因爲（文法極簡單，變化有規則）一無（拿去臉上的毛）及開不出菜單之苦，所以無需文學的天才），無論什麽人都可以學會的。學過某種外國語的人，再學世界語，自然更容易，而且决不會對於已學的外國語有害，所以無所謂（改途易辙）。</p>
<p>錢先生舉例證明世界語在中國内地）的醫院裹行不通，以致被打了（幾針鹽水）。這眞是（故意假設引證，以亂聽聞）。退一萬步說，卽算錢先生假設的引證是可能的，但我想，天下的病人和看護婦一律用基本英語對話時也有困難，如果病人要打（幾針鹽水），就不能用（注射器（Ｓyringe）這個字，而得說（一種尖頭的有推拉器的管子，用空氣的壓力放水在它裘邊，再放出來成一很細的水線，以爲園藝，治療等用）。（見（國際每日文選）四十號（英國人的基本英語批判））可見還是不免要（面帶怒容）的。</p>
<p>錢先生說，世界語的（短處是爲時尙早，用途不虞，卽將文和言混爲一談，也嫌太没有書給我们讀了）。是的，世界語誕生迄今，還只四十六年，與各國的國語文獻相比，在（量）上是不及的。但單就學習書一項而論，就有以五十二種文字編的，一千萬册以上（見一九三二出版Ｅ.Drezen的（國際語問題）二三頁）。據國際無線電委員會統計，一九二九年各國以世界語演說及報告就有二千零六次。世界語是國際語，所以也不能單就它被用的（數量）來估計的。但是我们看基本英語如何？牠是一九三零年發表的，（爲時）之久可知。除了十本小册子之外，還有點什麽？世界上可有一家懂得（令眼出水的白根）或（諾亞放出去看可有陸地的那種鳥，放在爐火上煮的）（烤鴿子）的飯店没有？其（用途）說得上廣嗎？</p>
<p>錢先生說：（俄國因爲俄文太難，不能强人學好，所以便利用Ｅsperarto，以與世界各國的普羅階級通聲氣。）這是對世界語的歪曲。不值識者一笑。世界語在俄國之通行，那是因爲他们確認國際語的必要，和世界語的實用性之故。世界　本身只是種言語，它果然未嘗不可爲一各國的　羅階級　　　），但亦可以作其他的用處。我们且舉中國的事實來說吧：一九二一年在廣州舉行的第七屆中國全國敎育會議　曾議决將世界語加入師範學校課程。南京中央黨部也曾以世界語編印（山東問題）（五三濟南事件）及（田中奏章）兩書。至於各弱小民族的文學，得以移植到中國來的，也就不是靠的英語或基本英語，大部份還是　了世界語，世界語同志周作人，胡愈之，王魯彥，巴金，孫用，鍾憲民諸先生的翻譯可以作證。</p>
<p>以上是對於錢先生的曲解的糾正。對於錢先生的主張，還有許多話想說，但我不能呌（自由談）專做我和錢先生的（用　之地），並且光華書局（讀者月刋）創刋號（基本英語批判特輯）也不日可出，我如再和錢先生討論，亦當在）讀者）或其他地方刋登。現在我總結我對於基本英語的幾點主要的主張；（一）任何民族（國）語都不得爲國際語，（二）基本英語是違反言語發展的，反進化的，閱倒車的東西，（三）基本英語因其曲折的表現法並不較英語爲易，較世界語更不及，（四）基本英語並非英語合理之妥善可用的方案。</p>

<p>Red Bandits in Youxi Fled South with Their Main Force</p>
<p>Scattered in Sha County into Small Factions</p>
<p>Yanping Establishes Bandit Suppression Headquarters Command</p>
<p>(Xiamen) After the Communists were generally attacked upstream, except for a portion fleeing to Shaowu and being defeated by Liu Zhou, the main force of the Youxi bandits fled south. They were intercepted and scattered in Sha County by Mao Weisou's 61st and 78th Divisions into small factions. Currently, there is no sign of them gathering to return to Tingzhou. The dangerous period upstream has passed. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Jiang Yan telegraphs that the remnants of the bandit's puppet 5th Division have retreated to Shaxi, and our army is advancing toward that location. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Song's Army Enters Guyuan, Japanese Side Issues Warning</p>
<p>A Japanese Plane Arrives in Zhangjiakou and Drops a Warning Letter…</p>
<p>Two Demands for Song's Army to Withdraw West of Zhangbei and Longguan</p>
<p>Two Otherwise, the Japanese and Puppet Armies Will Take Decisive Action</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Beiping Authorities Send Representatives to Negotiate with the Japanese Side, Feng Zhian Becomes the Zhangjiakou Garrison Commander <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Dengyu's troops arrived in Guyuan the day before yesterday. The local puppet army, Li Shouxin's Suo Huachen division, and over a thousand miscellaneous troops retreated towards Duolun. Zhao's division immediately concentrated in Guyuan. Various troops from the Jifang and Tang areas of eastern Chahar are gathering near Dushikou, and their actions are attracting attention. Yao Jingchuan is responsible for the garrison of Baochang, and Ruan Xuanwu is responsible for the garrison of Kangbao, preventing miscellaneous troops and puppet troops from disturbing the west. Song has appointed Feng Zhian and others as responsible for the security of the Zhangjiakou area. Feng has taken office as the Zhangjiakou garrison commander. Song is scheduled to come to Beiping tonight to meet with He, to discuss the diplomatic response to the Chahar Province situation. After a brief delay, he will return to Zhangjiakou. Zhi Hanzian returned to Zhangjiakou this afternoon to convey everything to the various troops. The Beiping military authorities have sent representatives to negotiate with Japanese Military Attaché Chaisan regarding the Japanese warning letter. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to someone who returned to Beiping this morning, at 1:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese plane flew over Zhangjiakou and dropped a warning letter stating that if Song's army advances further east of Zhangbei and Longguan, decisive action will be taken, and Zhangjiakou will be bombed. After receiving this warning, the Zhangjiakou authorities immediately telegraphed Beiping to consult He. This action by the Japanese army is likely due to Song's army's recent capture of Guyuan and advance toward Duolun, hence the intimidating move. It is still unknown how the Beiping military authorities will respond. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese planes distributed leaflets in Zhangjiakou. Chaisan claims that Zhangyuan is our territory, and our army is suppressing bandits. Song Shiru and Liang intervened and have telegraphed the Guandong Army to stop it. Song Zheyuan will return to Beiping on the 15th at midnight and visit He on the 16th, returning to Zhangjiakou the day after tomorrow. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegraphs that Liu Guitang telegraphs that Ji's army's Wu regiment fled to Dushikou and was dealt with by Xue Zhiguang's brigade of Liu's army, with several hundred people eliminated and over a hundred guns seized. Fang Shisan also telegraphed Song, expressing his willingness to leave the army and go abroad, seeking material assistance. Zhao Dengyu's division has entered Guyuan. Li Shouxin has retreated to Duolun, plotting a counterattack with puppet army Suo Huichen. Zhao telegraphed the provincial government on the 14th, reporting that he led his troops to Guyuan, awaiting further orders. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Qingting's cavalry dispersed bandits in Zhangbei and also intercepted remnants of Fang Ji's troops in Da Hulun, under the jurisdiction of Zhangzuo County. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan is rushing back from Tianjin tonight to discuss the Chahar situation with He Yingqin, because the Japanese army is threatening that if the Chinese army does not withdraw from Guyuan, they will take severe action. The Chinese community believes that the Japanese army fears that Zhao Dengyu will occupy Guyuan and then advance on Duolun, hence this threat. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources, the Japanese will take action in Shanhaiguan. Meanwhile, the World Evening Post reprinted a dispatch from Zhangjiakou stating that a Japanese plane flew over Zhangjiakou yesterday afternoon, dropping leaflets stating that if Song Zheyuan's troops do not immediately withdraw from Guyuan, they will hold Song Zheyuan accountable and destroy Zhangjiakou with bombs.

<p>Planning to Go to Yutian via Funing. Yu Xuezhong Orders County to Stop Them. Emergency Relief Begins to Be Distributed in the War Zone.</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that the Old Mouse Gang, bandit troops of about three to four thousand men in the Yu Pass and Jiukou area, have accepted an offer of amnesty from Shi Yousan. They suddenly notified the Funing County government a few days ago of their intention to go to Yutian via Funing. I have telegraphed to stop them from passing through.

The monthly military expenses for North China are 5.4 million yuan. The current military downsizing conference decided to reduce each division by 20,000 yuan, totaling about 700,000 to 800,000. My troops will be reduced by about ten thousand men. If the central government cannot provide sufficient assistance, we will still have no rice to cook. (15th) (Beiping) Emergency relief for 12 counties, including Miyun, has begun, totaling 102,500 yuan. Relief personnel have left Beiping with the funds to handle the matter separately.

<h3 id="e6">The So-Called New Policy of Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota is in Fact <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A Change in Diplomacy Towards Europe and America, But the Same Established Steps Towards China</p>
<p>Former Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida's (scorched earth diplomacy) was externally criticized internationally and internally constrained by warlords. Therefore, he could only use the excuse of physical illness and old age to resign. Hirota, who replaced Uchida, claimed to practice (reasonable diplomacy) and first changed the infamous "scorched earth" name. But in fact, before Hirota took office, he had already reached a clear understanding with the military. If we observe Araki's speech on Hirota's assumption of office, it is clearly stated that Hirota will still follow Uchida's diplomatic policy. The navy also had the same intention. So what is the so-called new diplomatic policy of Japan by Hirota? Summarizing the main points declared by Hirota himself as follows:</p>
<p>To liquidate Japan's isolated diplomacy after withdrawing from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>To open up the economic siege of Japan by the powers.</p>
<p>To earnestly prepare for the Second Washington Naval Conference.</p>
<p>To resolve various disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan.</p>
<p>The policy towards China remains unchanged. Only efforts are made in personnel matters, and the independence of Manchuria (puppet) is actively supported.</p>
<p>On the surface, the above points seem reasonable and indeed have a tendency to change. However, if we examine Japan's past diplomacy, we will know that Uchida's diplomacy failed because he ignored the facts and was simply obstinate, and was also manipulated by the military. Compared with the so-called double diplomacy in the past, it was even more tyrannical. Internationally, he recognized force as omnipotent, believing that Europe and the United States had no time to look east, and that our country was not strong enough, so we could take advantage of the situation to rob and loot. The public decision of the League of Nations could be overturned. The demand for justice from our country could be ignored. Finally, he achieved his wish to withdraw from the League of Nations. However, what about his separate diplomacy? His initial intention was that Britain was Japan's old ally, and there was no problem in uniting with Britain to control the United States. The Soviet Union was also the target of public criticism, and Japan could control it at will. The United States was also shaken by the economic panic. Even if Japan's diplomacy was isolated, what harm would it do? How could he know that the economic relationship between Britain and Japan was already at the forefront of opposition. The textile industries of India and other underdeveloped countries have also sprung up to compete with Japan. Japan is already in a situation where it is surrounded by enemies economically. Therefore, the so-called separate diplomacy has become isolated diplomacy. At this time, even if he regretted the failure to withdraw from the League of Nations, it would be too late.</p>
<p>After free trade turned into extreme protectionism, the Ottawa Conference determined the economic alliance of the British Empire. The reason why the United States launched the National Industrial Recovery Act was to use the organizational power of politics to promote economic stagnation. From a purely economic standpoint, it still contains a very strong degree of xenophobia. From an international relations perspective, it has even more serious military implications. Japan's actions in the past two years have not only been intended to re-divide the East Asian market, but also to advance west to India and erode South America to the east. How can Britain and the United States not quickly defend themselves? If Japan does not abandon its aggressive policy, what benefit will it have to advocate diplomatic transformation to Europe and the United States? The disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union are not limited to the North Pacific fishery and the Northeast border. The biggest knot is also the invasion of the three northeastern provinces by Japanese militarists and the support of puppets. In addition, there is the issue of the Middle East Road. Japan must instigate the puppets to carry out plunder. Therefore, there is only a superficial and unavoidable diplomatic relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, and it is difficult to solve the problem.</p>
<p>China and Japan are neighboring countries geographically and have historical origins. However, in the past 20 years, Japan has made absolutely no sincere effort to repair relations, except for making efforts to invade. The September 18th Incident even brewed an irreconcilable hatred among the Chinese nation. Now that the Japanese foreign affairs authorities have been replaced, it is impossible to resolve the national disputes between the two countries by relying solely on personal relationships and individual friendships. Moreover, Hirota has stated that there will be no change in the diplomatic policy towards China when he takes office, and the four northeastern provinces will still be forcibly occupied. Therefore, the diplomatic deadlock between China and Japan cannot be broken. The new policy towards Europe and the United States may not be realized. Therefore, Hirota's diplomacy is still only attached to the military and follows Uchida's old ways. The so-called (reasonable diplomacy) is just a different name but the same reality as scorched earth diplomacy.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan arrived in Beiping at noon today and talked about the mission of coming to Beiping: (1) Plan to send personnel to Chahar to comfort Tan Zixin's troops and send personnel to Xinjiang to comfort the headquarters. (2) Plan to hold a memorial service for the anti-Japanese soldiers of this army who died in battle in Beiping on a regular basis. Currently, there are more than 2,000 people in my troops stationed in Xinjiang, which have been reorganized by Sheng Shicai. About 6,000 people are stationed in Chahar, led by Tan Zixin, and are formally reorganized by the central government. All the troops have been handed over to the central government. I have resigned from the army. The position of member of the Military Committee has been presented to the central government and the Military Committee, but has not been approved. I will not go to Chahar. Tan Zixin may come to Beiping to meet. I am afraid that rumors will arise. Therefore, I plan to stay in Beiping for a short time and return to Tianjin soon. He Yingqin will be visited within a few days. Wang Delin is currently in Guangdong, and Su Bingwen is in Suzhou. I did not meet them before going north. I admire Zhu Qinglan's personality very much for the National Salvation Donation. Zhu himself will not be corrupt, but there may be inappropriate use of funds, which is also a mistake in employing people. As for the announcement of accounts, it is not easy to announce due to the inconvenient income, but the expenditure part can be made public. (15th Dispatch)</p>

The statistics reached about 200 million taels. This loan of 50 million US dollars is equivalent to about 200 million national currency, which has never exceeded the import amount of last year. It will not only not hinder the price of domestic agricultural products, but will also benefit my country's industry and commerce. As for the organization of the management agency, it was established in New York in July (General Office of the Republic of China for Purchasing and Transporting American Cotton and Wheat). Wei Wenbin was appointed as the director of the management office. After shipping to Shanghai, the Central Bank of Shanghai will set up a (Management Office for the Import of American Cotton and Wheat), and Xi Demao will be appointed as the director, responsible for it. It is also heard that the use of American cotton and wheat has been assumed at the Lushan Conference. The percentage that each use should account for is roughly: 30% for reviving rural industries, 30% for improving national cotton, 20% for special construction, and 20% for sorting out the currency system. It will be determined after Song returns to Beijing next week. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Hirota, the new Foreign Minister, who took over the very moment when Japan's public expected so much, suddenly replaced Uchida and stepped onto the central stage of the political situation, said that the Japanese nation is considering which direction to proceed to in the future. The nation has great expectations for this issue. The world often says (extraordinary times) when they open their mouths, thinking that the whole world is unanimously rejecting Japan. However, when the world progresses evenly, and one country leaps forward alone, then that country will inevitably encounter all kinds of difficulties, but this can be regarded as the evidence that the country is riding the tide of the times and can be congratulated. I am determined not to think that Japanese diplomacy has reached a dead end and encountered difficulties. When (Manchukuo) fully demonstrates the face of an independent country, what Japan has done for the peace of the Far East will naturally be clear. I have no worries about the future of imperial diplomacy. (15th Japan Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) When the new Foreign Minister Hirota Koki met with Prime Minister Saito at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday and formally promised to take office as Foreign Minister, he especially stated his aspirations for the ideal implementation of Japanese diplomacy and requested the Prime Minister to acknowledge it. The conditions are as follows: (1) The current function of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is too weak to liquidate the isolated diplomacy after withdrawing from the League of Nations, to repel the economic attacks of the great powers on Japan, and to prepare for the Second Washington Conference, so enriching the funding of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been included in the next year's budget. Please Prime Minister give priority to acknowledging this matter. (2) The economic war of the great powers against Japan is gradually intensifying. Not only should the budget expenditure on China be increased, but the domestic administrative organs such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Overseas Affairs should be reformed as soon as possible. For the government's purpose, it is necessary to resolutely carry out domestic political reforms. (3) The basic tone of Japanese diplomacy should be determined after contact and consultation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the military, and other relevant ministries. However, when actually implementing diplomacy, it is absolutely necessary for the government to adopt a consistent attitude. Please Prime Minister pay special attention to this point.

Minister of Finance Takahashi admitted the inevitability of the military's demands and told reporters on the 14th about the principle of national defense first, but if the Ministry of Finance acknowledged the 800 million yuan demanded by the military, the next year's budget would be 2.2 billion yuan, which would make it more difficult for the government to establish financial policies.

<p>(Tokyo) Today marks the anniversary of Japan's recognition of the puppet state. Army Minister Araki issued a special statement saying, "On this day last year, Japan, convinced that cooperation with (Manchukuo) for its healthy development would bring peace to the Far East and contribute to world peace, overcame all difficulties and recognized the country. Looking back on the state of (Manchukuo) over the past year, one cannot help but feel deeply moved. The campaigns to clear out North Manchuria and Jehol, the completion of the unification of (Manchukuo), and the reduction of (bandit) disturbances to a quarter of previous years, as well as the near disappearance of anti-Manchukuo volunteer armies with political motives, and the fundamental construction projects for national operations such as (Manchukuo)'s official system, legal system, monetary system, and finance, are now in place. The smooth and rapid development of these projects is a cause for celebration for both Japan (and Manchukuo) and East Asia. Japan has not hesitated to make great sacrifices in both spiritual and material terms for (Manchukuo), exemplified by the Hulunbuir and Jehol expeditions and its withdrawal from the League of Nations. I earnestly hope that the Japanese people will focus their eyes on the global situation and the great plan for the nation's centuries, without yielding to external pressure or internal difficulties, and that Japan (and Manchukuo) will cooperate and support each other to implement a policy of coexistence and co-prosperity, striving to assist the imperial destiny. At the same time, I hope that the (Manchukuo) people will trust in the righteous assistance of the imperial nation, enrich its content, overcome the difficulties of establishing the nation, and advance towards the completion of the ideal land of Wangdao (benevolent rule), contributing to peace in the Far East." (15th, Japanese Allied News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, on the anniversary of Japan's recognition of (Manchukuo), issued a statement saying, "It has not been even a year and a half since the establishment of (Manchukuo), yet its governance is steadily progressing, and I cannot help but express my utmost respect and satisfaction. The constructive projects carried out by (Manchukuo) in this short period, such as security, finance, and industrial development, are concrete facts that no one can deny. The cooperation between Japan (and Manchukuo), two independent nations, and the benefits it brings to both countries, can be clearly understood by looking back at the relationship between Japan (and Manchukuo) three years ago from today's state. How can the independent event of (Manchukuo), with its 120 million square kilometers of territory and 30 million people, be caused by external forces such as conspiracy or invasion? Anyone who interprets it in this way is making a major error. If China can understand its true intention, Japan is ready to understand China with a pure heart and has the preparation to shake hands. We are satisfied that Russia (and Manchukuo), as neighbors to the west, are maintaining friendly relations, and that Japan and the United States are becoming closer, which also suits the needs of the current world."

<p>Lord Lytton Sternly Refutes</p>
<p>(London) The Times has continuously published articles commenting on Japan's actions in the Far East. A recent article stated that "(the existence of Manchukuo) should be regarded as a fait accompli." Lord Lytton, the former chairman of the League of Nations' Manchuria Inquiry Commission, strongly opposed this view of The Times and sent an open letter to the newspaper, requesting its publication. His essential words were, "Whether Japan's attitude at the time was justified is not something that can be arbitrarily asserted based on personal opinions at this point. Since the League of Nations' Extraordinary Assembly has unanimously determined that Japan's attitude was unjustified, to say that the Sino-Japanese conflict is unrelated to the current and future situation in the Far East is tantamount to creating a theory that contradicts the League of Nations' opinion. If this theory is unfortunately endorsed by responsible politicians in various countries, the foundation of world peace established after the European War will be completely destroyed."

<p>Both Countries' Competition to Strengthen Naval Armaments Reveals Initial Signs</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Communist Party's mouthpiece (Pravda) believes that Japan's continued aggression against China is the main reason why the US-Japan conflict is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, the initial signs of this conflict can be seen in the competition between the two countries to strengthen their naval armaments. In commenting on the recent meeting between Japanese Army Minister Araki and Finance Minister Takahashi to discuss the military budget, Pravda stated, "(The developments in recent days are sufficient to prove that the US-Japan conflict is undergoing a new and intensified form. Japan is currently trying to seize the entire North China and will further advance into southwestern China. The competition for the Chinese sphere of influence is the main and decisive key to the current stage of US-Japan disputes. The competition for naval armaments in the Pacific is proceeding at a feverish pace. The military expansion of Japan and the United States is sufficient to further disintegrate the economic organizations of both countries, which have already been shaken by the global crisis. The Japanese army and navy are also attempting to create a situation of equal naval armaments among Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom in preparation for the preliminary meetings on the eve of the 1935 Washington Conference.)"

Shiratori said to reporters on board the ship before departing, "My trip to take office, especially through the United States, is not based on government instructions, but my own initiative. I intend to meet with various people in the United States to discuss Japanese-American issues, especially the (Manchukuo) issue and the Sino-Japanese issue, hoping to deepen the American understanding. The issue that will arise in the future is naturally the naval issue. The situation in the Far East now is completely different from the time of the 1922 Washington Conference, so existing treaties cannot be used as a standard. I will advocate that negotiations should start from a new starting point. How the future development of Sino (Manchukuo) Japanese Chinese international relations will be is something that not only diplomatic authorities but also the entire Japanese people should pay close attention to. Increasing the happiness and peace of the entire Far East should not be achieved solely by the formation of an economic alliance between Japan (and Manchukuo), but should also involve inviting China to adjust the close political and economic relations among China, Japan, and (Manchukuo) in order to achieve the final goal.

<p>(London) The London Morning Post commented on the recent closeness between France and Russia today, giving it a humorous verdict, saying, "When dining with the devil, one must have a long spoon." The newspaper's opinion is that "Germany's Hitler deeply hates and loathes communist doctrine, so to say that countries that oppose Soviet Russia also deeply hate and loathe it is understandable. However, to say that Soviet Russia has become a country that can coexist peacefully is a misunderstanding. The Bolshevik faction is still an independent faction with followers everywhere, and its nests exist in France, Germany, England, and the United States. Although Germany's National Socialist Party has eliminated the Communist Party, this is only a temporary obstacle and has not fundamentally changed the direction of its policy. So why can France, which once regarded communism as an enemy, now regard it as a friend? Is it because the French middle class has not yet been communistized that it can be considered a non-issue? If Bolshevik elements can establish an opportunity for closeness with France, they will further and more easily complete their deception, sale, and destruction of France's nation. Therefore, Herriot should conserve his saliva, and Air Minister Cot can also save his gasoline, without having to rush back and forth between Paris and Moscow." (14th, National News)</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Mexico City, 14th: Former President Calles, the representative of Mexico to the Pan-American Conference this winter, and Finance Minister Pani declared today that the Mexican representatives will propose the elimination of all political issues at this Pan-American Conference, focusing exclusively on discussing Latin American (economic Monroeism). Because the current Cuban revolutionary movement has attracted so much attention from all sides, if political debates are held at the conference, there may be a risk of division. Mexico is currently neutral on the Cuban issue and, while it does not support intervention, it will not express any opinion, fearing that if the Cuban issue is discussed at the conference, it will strain Pan-American friendship. Therefore, it advocates avoiding politics and focusing on economics. The Mexican government will propose the organization of an all-American economic bloc, the purpose of which is exclusively to seek self-sufficiency for countries in the Western Hemisphere. Because Latin American countries currently encounter tariff barriers everywhere in Europe, only by carrying out a (specialized Latin American) movement can there be good results. The United States will certainly join this bloc, and the organization of this bloc will be beneficial to the United States, at least temporarily. However, the development of industries in various countries in the Western Hemisphere will gradually reduce the tendency to purchase foreign goods, especially European goods.</p>

<p>Military Officers Remain Stubbornly Resistant</p>
<p>Labor Unrest Brewing</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Havana, 15th: The Cuban government has announced a policy of near dictatorship. The government openly declared that what the government considers to be related to the welfare of the country should take precedence over individual rights. Four hundred military officers who support former President Cespedes are currently housed in the National Hotel. Soldiers have been added around the hotel, and machine guns have been placed. The guards are all armed and prepared because of rumors of a split in the army. According to a dispatch from the capital of Chile, US Secretary of State Hull has stated to the representatives of Latin America that even if it endangers the property of the American people, the United States does not want to intervene in the Cuban affair.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Philadelphia, 15th: Another US warship, the New Mexico, will sail to Guantanamo, Cuba, because the situation there is serious. This warship has just undergone repairs, the armor has been thickened, the superstructure has been increased, and there are new facilities on the side of the ship to maintain buoyancy and protect against torpedoes.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Havana, 14th: Although no major events have occurred here, tranquility has not yet been restored. Most importantly, military officers who do not support the new government continue to resist. There are rumors that a serious conflict will soon occur within the military.

<p>▲ Reuters, Pennsylvania, 14th:</p>
<p>The coal miners' strike in Pennsylvania has resulted in a bloody tragedy. Six people were shot dead and twenty were injured with clubs at three mines in Fayette today due to a riot. It is reported that police opened fire on strikers after clashing with strike pickets. The governor, upon hearing the alarm, secretly issued a mobilization order for the National Guard and is now working to place the riot area under martial law. President Roosevelt has sent personnel to investigate the shooting. President Roosevelt has become intolerant of the delay in signing the coal industry rules. After the riot occurred here today, Roosevelt immediately summoned General Johnson to the White House, ordering him to end the negotiations and saying that the time has come to take decisive action.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Washington, 15th: President Roosevelt recently held a meeting with coal industry representatives at the White House. After the meeting, Roosevelt declared that the coal industry rules have been drafted and that he hopes that both labor and management in the coal industry can reach an agreement within 24 hours. The governor of Pennsylvania reported to the government by telephone that disturbances had occurred in the state's mining area and that he had once requisitioned the National Guard to assist the police.

<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 14th: US President Roosevelt now wants to personally preside over and promote the plan to increase the production of capital goods (goods that can be regarded as capital, as opposed to consumer goods). He will first convene leaders of the steel industry to begin a meeting on Saturday to discuss the prices of steel rails and building materials. According to a report by White House statisticians, the production of steel rails and structural steel is currently at its lowest point. This trend will cause the production of consumer goods and capital goods to lose balance. From the beginning, the US government has focused on the output of consumer goods, but now production machinery will soon be worn out and new supplies are needed, so it feels necessary to start paying attention to the output of capital goods.</p>

<p>Military Council Decides to Actually Reduce by More Than 547,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Starting October 1st, the Military Council Will Send Personnel to Inspect Various Armies</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: The method of reorganizing finance in North China starts with reducing the size and pay of the armies. The Military Council has now formally approved a reduction in military expenses of more than 547,000 yuan. At the same time, it has been decided that starting on October 1st, the Military Council will send personnel to inspect the various armies in North China after the war in order to reorganize them. Today (14th), Acting Chairman He dispatched Zou Zuohua, Wang Haoji, and Hou Cheng as three inspectors to inspect the various armies in North China in different ways. Sun Dianying received an order from the Military Council today to abolish the army corps organization and immediately cancel the name of the Ninth Army Corps. His troops will leave Baotou to the west and go to Qinghai for reclamation. The details of each party are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The Military Council held a regular meeting at Ju Ren Tang at 10:00 AM on the 13th. The attendees were Acting Chairman He Yingqin, Members Jiang Bocheng, Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Qin Decun, Wang Shuchang, Rong Zhen, Bao Wenwei, Men Zhizhong, Wei Yisan, Zou Zuohua, Qian Dajun, Gao Weiyue, Hu Yukun, Wei Zonghan, Huang Shiyue, Chen Qinruo, Yu Xuezhong (represented by Liu Zhonggan), Song Zheyuan (represented by Qin Decun), and Sun Dianying (represented by Wang Shiping and Hu Jiesan), totaling more than 20 people. Military Council Section Chiefs Shen Zhenrong and Hua Biliang also attended. Chairman He Yingqin first had Bao Wenwei report on the documents and telegrams from various parties, and then began to discuss the plan for reducing the size and pay of the armies in North China, which was decided at the temporary meeting on the 11th. Chairman He Yingqin first stood up and spoke, saying that the plan for reducing the size and pay of the armies in North China had been completely decided at the last temporary meeting. However, the amount of pay reduction for Sun Dianying's 41st Army had some discrepancies and needed to be discussed. He then asked Sun's representative, Wang Shiping, to state his opinion. Mr. Wang stood up and said that the 41st Army's pay has always been lower than that of other armies, and that this time the reduction was calculated according to the army's organization. The army headquarters still had four special battalions and four special companies attached, including transportation, engineer, artillery, radio teams, etc., which were also recognized by the Military Council. The pay amount calculated this time did not include the four special battalions and four special companies, so he requested that these two special units be added before determining the reduction amount. After discussion, it was decided to reduce their size to two special battalions and two special companies. In addition, the situation of the 106th Division's Shen Ke Division, which was attached to mortar and radio teams, was similar and would be reduced in the same way.</p>

<p>The armies in North China previously had army corps organizations during the Anti-Japanese War. Now that the situation is peaceful, the organization of the armies urgently needs to be reduced.

The Ninth Army Corps, Sun Dianying's unit, also received an order from the Military Branch Committee today (14th) to dissolve the army corps organization. After receiving the order, Sun has issued a notice to his subordinates to immediately abolish the name of the Ninth Army Corps. Sun will continue to serve as the commander of the 41st Army. As for Sun's unit's westward departure from Baotou to reclaim land in Qinghai, it is currently being actively prepared.

All troops will begin their westward movement from Baotou after the forward stations arrive in Wuyuan. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Feng Yuxiang's Thoughts on the September 18th Incident <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>How to Commemorate September 18th?</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Resistance Should Focus on Implementation</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After concluding his affairs in Chahar, Feng Yuxiang returned to Tai'an and has not changed his original intention of resisting Japan and saving the country. As the second anniversary of the painful September 18th Incident approaches, Feng has specially published "How to Commemorate September 18th?" The text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>It has been two years since the September 18th Incident. Although the capital has been moved back to Nanjing and the salaries of government personnel have been restored to their original levels, a superficial appearance of peace and prosperity seems to have returned. However, the lost territory of the three northeastern provinces has not been recovered. On the contrary, Rehe and Yu Guan have been lost. After the Tanggu Truce was established, Luandong was nominally received, but the Japanese intervened in bandit suppression. The Japanese do not allow intervention in Xinglong County's territory outside the Great Wall. They openly stated that the Great Wall line is the border of Manchuria. These are obvious facts that have been published in various newspapers. These facts clearly prove that the current difficulties are deeper than they were a year ago. The deeper the difficulties, the more silent the reaction. Slogans such as resisting goods, preparing for war, and resisting Japan have gradually vanished like smoke. This is truly a major crisis for our country. Before the lost territory is recovered, all of our citizens should bear the responsibility of resisting Japan. Those who bear heavy responsibilities for national affairs need not be said. Regardless of the method of resisting Japan, whether it is long-term resistance or (resistance while negotiating), the word "resistance" must not be abandoned. More importantly, "resistance" must be put into practice. There must be facts in front of the compatriots. Otherwise, it will inevitably form a verbal mantra of "resistance", only deceiving oneself and others. I have always advocated resisting Japan, especially advocating armed resistance. Therefore, I must practice what I preach. At the time of the crisis in Peiping and Tianjin, I was deceived by the patriotic sentiment for Rehe, ignoring my strength and avoiding danger, collecting volunteers to fight the Japanese puppets, hoping to preserve Chahar and recover the lost territory as an example to the world. After several bloody battles, more than 1,600 brave soldiers were killed or wounded. Fortunately, Shichang, Kangbao, Guyuan, Duolun, and other places were successively recovered, which caused the Japanese puppets and traitors to falsely accuse me of communism and separatism, attempting to disrupt international public opinion and incite internal disputes in our country. I only want to resist Japan, and of course, I strive for peace internally. I also received notification from the government officials, Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek, that the central government has a whole plan for resisting Japan. Since there is a whole plan for resisting Japan, even though we do not know its content, in order to avoid internal disputes, we have to retreat and listen to the government to implement its whole plan. Therefore, on August 6th, all military and political powers were completely handed over to the government. However, in this practical anti-Japanese struggle, I have gained several understandings: (1) The people and soldiers are indeed determined to resist Japan. In the serious period of national crisis, the anti-Japanese atmosphere has been silent. Therefore, it is generally believed that the people and soldiers are not supportive. In fact, this is not the case. The people and soldiers are indeed patriots. During this recovery of eastern Chahar, in the deserted areas where there was no food or lodging, the Anti-Japanese Allied Army was welcomed and helped by the people everywhere and acted as guides for our army. They all scrambled to disrupt the rear of the Japanese puppet army. The Allied Army was temporarily formed by various scattered anti-Japanese troops. They lacked food and clothing, and were short of ammunition. They were in the rain, walking in the wilderness. However, as soon as they heard the order to attack, they all bravely sacrificed themselves. It can be seen that the military and popular sentiments are full of anti-Japanese enthusiasm. The reason why the anti-Japanese atmosphere is depressed is just that they have not been given the opportunity to express it. (2) The Anti-Japanese War must have a plan and unified command. In the Battle of the Great Wall, our hundreds of thousands of troops were not unfaithful or brave, but the failure was due to the lack of a unified plan and command. This may be a major reason. This time, the recovery of eastern Chahar was far less than the strength of the Battle of the Great Wall. Moreover, it was also a joint army, not an entire system of troops. However, the reason why it was effective was that it was more planned and the command was unified. Therefore, after I sent a telegram on the same day to hand over all political power, the Military Branch Committee announced that Duolun had been lost again on the 13th. It is thought that the lack of unified command in the transition of military and political power was also an important cause of the failure. Based on the above observations, although the anti-Japanese atmosphere is depressed, the patriotic heart of the people is not indifferent. Although the Anti-Japanese War has failed, it is not entirely impossible to fight. The government has repeatedly said that it has a plan for resisting Japan, which is what all our compatriots are praying for. It seems that in the crisis of national crisis, there is no way to save oneself. The important thing is to implement it.</p>
<p>Therefore, our current commemoration of September 18th is not about verbal disputes. It should be to resist Japan, which is already well known to the people. In the future, we should all determine the method of resisting Japan and practice it personally. Even if there are some concerns and obstacles, as long as we can persevere to the end and do our part to resist Japan, we will naturally have results. Otherwise, the facts are obvious, and even if we are good at defending ourselves, we cannot cover up our mistakes. In the past, I have repeatedly made suggestions to the government regarding the plan for resisting Japan. People from all walks of life have also made many famous comments. However, now that more territory has been lost and the country is weaker, and the commemoration of September 18th has reached two years, I believe that the current commemoration of September 18th is about (implementing anti-Japanese resistance). All the things I have said before, such as consolidating national defense, recovering lost territory, and resisting goods, will not be repeated. However, in the course of implementing anti-Japanese resistance, military preparedness must be emphasized, and political aspects must also be reformed. In terms of the people, they should have a spirit of fearlessness, unite with each other, supervise the government, and eliminate traitors to achieve the anti-Japanese spirit. In terms of the government, it should allow the people to express their anti-Japanese opinions as much as possible and develop anti-Japanese forces as much as possible. Foreign affairs and finance must be completely open, so that suspicions can be dispelled and the support of the people can be obtained. In terms of the national economy, efforts should be made to revive it, and the boundless economic aggression of imperialism should not be allowed, or even to promote the sale of surplus products for it. In terms of politics, efforts should be made to eliminate corruption and rectify discipline. These are the minimum reforms that must be made at present. If not, the country will not be a country, how can we talk about resistance? Even if there is the largest meeting and the most eloquent speech, it will not be enough to commemorate September 18th, and the shame of September 18th will increase year by year until it is dragged into the Second World War and perish with the country. Even if we make statements that fill the court, what benefit will it bring to the country? Therefore, the commemoration of September 18th must be in (implementing anti-Japanese resistance).</p>
<h3 id="e90">Economic Committee Dredges the Huayang River <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Has Ordered the Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau to Send Personnel for Surveying</p>
<p>Giant Sluice Gate to be Built at the River Mouth to Control Tides and Water Flow</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Huayang River is located at the junction of the three provinces of Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi. It originates from the Huangpeng Lake and extends to the mouth of the Yangtze River, stretching for more than 400 li. Recently, it has not been dredged for many years, the riverbed is silted up, and the inland lakes are wide and unfathomable. Every time the tide comes, the river flows back, and the river channel often suffers from blockage, resulting in the flooding of about 40 million mu of polder fields along the river, which cannot be saved. The benefits are abandoned on the land, which is very regrettable. Recently, the National Economic Commission has accepted the request of the people from the seven counties connected to the rivers in the three provinces and decided to start dredging immediately. Because the river connects large lakes internally and large rivers externally, the water势悬殊, and it will not be effective without control in the event of a tide, it was decided to build a giant sluice gate at the river mouth. The Wuhu-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau has been ordered to send personnel for surveying in order to plan construction. After receiving the order, the bureau immediately sent three surveying teams to work, with two teams surveying the water flow and one team surveying the water surface. It is estimated that after the Huayang River is dredged and the sluice gate is built, the water flow can be controlled on time, and at the very least, 10 million mu of arable land can be obtained for migration and cultivation, which will benefit the country and the people, which is no small matter.</p>
<p>Wang Baozhai, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Second District of Anhui Province and the Magistrate of Wuhu County, believes that most of the areas under his jurisdiction are riverside areas in southern Anhui. When the Yangtze River flooded during the 20th year of the Republic of China, he still thought that the unexpected event was accidental. Since then, however, dangerous situations have often occurred every time the flood season arrives, and special situations have become constant. The fertile areas will be flooded. Recently, he has specially drafted a (Letter of Opinions on Preventing Floods in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River) and submitted it to the Anhui Provincial Government, the Department of Construction, and the Headquarters, requesting adoption. The content is divided into (A) Causes of Floods in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River: 1. The river channel is becoming narrower, which is not enough to provide for the discharge of floods; 2. Reclaiming abandoned lakes into fields makes it difficult to slow down the rapid water flow; 3. Siltation has accumulated for many years, and the riverbed has become shallower; 4. The embankments are exposed to waves and lose their protection. (B) Fundamental Measures to Control Floods: 1. It is forbidden to reclaim wasteland and abandoned lakes in the future; 2. Reeds and willows should be planted on the river beaches near the dikes; 3. The riverbed should be dredged to make the depth reasonable. (13th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Red bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong suffered losses in the Yihuang campaign in June, they again practiced feigning a move to the east while attacking in the west, using only a small number of scattered bandits and a portion of ragtag bandits to advance towards Yongfeng and Jishui east of the central section of the Gan River, pretending to cross the Gan River westward. In fact, they moved all their main forces eastward, marching at night and hiding during the day, to attack western Fujian. Fang Shao and other bandits from Lichuan and Zixi were divided by Chongcheng, Guangze, and Shaowu, secretly attacking northern Fujian and echoing each other. In terms of southern Jiangxi, they adopted a defensive battle to prevent the Southern Route Army from cutting off their retreat. In terms of eastern Jiangxi, they adopted a contraction policy, using a small number of bandits to carry out guerrilla warfare in dangerous mountainous areas to contain the government forces. This is the general outline of the Red bandits' movements in the past two months of July and August. Therefore, since June, military affairs in northwestern Fujian have become increasingly tense, and there have been fierce battles in Liancheng and Yanping. There have also been frequent contacts between Huichang and Anyuan on the Jiangxi-Guangdong border. However, the northern and western routes of Jiangxi Province have been relatively quiet, so the armies on these two routes have focused all their efforts on reorganizing and replenishing their forces, improving themselves, and preparing for combat. At present, the bandit suppression armies on all routes are about to take unified action to launch a general offensive against the bandits. According to public announcements, the Guangdong Army has launched a large-scale bombing of the Red bandit fortifications on Junmen Ridge, which has been very successful. The Red bandits there have a tendency to withdraw from Huichang. Junmen Ridge is located south of Huichang, east to Wuping and Shanghang in Fujian, south to Pingyuan and Meixian in Guangdong, and west to Anyuan and Xunwu. It is a transportation hub for the three provinces. In the past, it was an important tax checkpoint in Jiangxi. The mountains are dense and it is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Therefore, the Red bandits focused on guarding it, on the one hand to cover the attack on Fujian, and on the other hand to consolidate the Ruijin base area where the puppet central government is located. The Guangdong Army, in order to aid Fujian, previously attacked Junmen Ridge from Xunwu and Anyuan. However, the bandits were familiar with the terrain and the fortifications were solid, so the Southern Route Army has made no special progress. Now that the Southern Route Army has deployed a large number of aircraft, they are flying to bomb it every day. It is reported that the bandit's blockhouses, gun emplacements, earthen forts, and all fortifications near Chengjiang, Qingxi, Wantiankeng, and Junmen Ridge have been destroyed. In general, the Southern Route Army can advance on a large scale, and the Red bandits there have a tendency to withdraw from Huichang. If the Southern Route Army occupies Huichang, then taking Ruijin will be like taking something out of a bag. (September 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Deng Shizeng Arrives in Guangdong <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Commissioned by Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai</p>
<p>To Discuss Cooperation with Chen Jitang in Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Jiangxi bandits turned to attack Yanping in western Fujian, the situation in Fujian has become tense. The 19th Route Army has specially sent Deng Shizeng, the chief of staff of the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, to Guangdong to discuss important issues such as coordinating with Guangdong in suppressing bandits and requesting Guangdong authorities to assist with military expenses. Deng arrived in the province on the morning of the 9th and immediately went to Meihua Village in Dongshan to visit Chen Jitang and convey the personal letters from Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai to Chen. It is reported that the Fujian authorities' opinions, in addition to discussing the political issues of the current situation, also hope that Guangdong can dispatch troops to enter western Fujian from Shanghang as soon as possible to attack Changting in a pincer movement to contain the bandits in northern Fujian, and to attack Junmen as soon as possible to destroy the bandit nests in eastern Jiangxi. In addition, the Fujian authorities sent a telegram to Guangdong a few days ago, stating that Guangdong Province is assisting the 19th Route Army with 200,000 yuan per month for military expenses. Now, due to the urgency of military affairs, Deng has also requested Guangdong to remit the assistance for September in advance and to borrow 200,000 rounds of water-cooled machine gun bullets and various rifle bullets. Chen Jitang has agreed to handle the assistance as requested, but the borrowing of bullets needs to be investigated for storage numbers before a decision can be made. According to Deng, his mission here is to discuss various bandit suppression plans with Chen Jitang. Once the discussion is settled, he will return to Fujian immediately. As for the rumors that Yanping has fallen, it is inaccurate. However, it is true that Yanping is trapped by bandits. There are only about 20,000 bandits, most of whom are vagrants. The bandits dare not attack our fortified positions. They only covet and harass places with weak forces. The number of provincial defense troops in northern Fujian is limited, so recently the bandit forces have moved from west to north. Now Commander-in-Chief Cai has transferred Mao Weishou and Tan Qixiu to suppress the bandit atmosphere. There will be no major problems in northern Fujian. However, it will take time to clear out these fleeing bandits. It is said that Deng will stay in Guangdong for a few days before returning to Fujian to report. (September 10th)</p>

<p>An unidentified male body was found in the river next to the railway in Xiaomeng Jiang Temple, 15th District. He was about 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, and Zhongshan shoes with no socks. There was a stone wound on the right corner of his head, and his skull was broken. He was lying face down, with mud on his back. The villagers observed that he seemed to have fallen from the train. The township police reported the case to the procuratorate for inspection. Today, the prosecutor led officials to the village by car to verify the facts, filled out the corpse form, and waited for a notice to be issued for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e94">County Government Meeting Discusses Converting Farmland to Grain Delivery <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Our county's areas of Punan, Shanyang, Caojing, Zhalin, and other places are located near the coast, and the soil is poor, which is different from Pubei. Therefore, it has always been farmland converted to grain delivery. Since the 18th year, the provincial authorities ordered the conversion to grain delivery. Farmers in Fengxian and Jinshan counties also requested the provincial authorities to withdraw their orders. After dispatching commissioners to conduct on-site surveys, it was found that Fengxian and Jinshan counties were temporarily allowed to postpone the conversion. However, Songjiang County was uniquely different. The local tenants heard about this and ran around telling each other. They jointly presented appeals to the provincial authorities, but the accumulated cases have not been resolved to this day. This time, the Department of Finance sent commissioners to urge the collection of taxes. County Magistrate Jin took the opportunity to convene farmers from various warehouses in Punan to discuss solutions. It has now been resolved that, starting this year, 40% of the original increased tax amount will be collected. As for the taxes owed after the 18th year, they will be discussed with the farmers when they return to their hometowns, and a report will be submitted to the county and then to the province for remission in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Wuxi Jail Warden Han Transferred to Zhenjiang <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The warden of the county jail in our county, Han Yuwen, recently found that the old prison buildings were dilapidated and the prisoners were crowded. It was urgent to add new prisons, so he drafted a plan and submitted it to the county government for approval. County Magistrate Yan ordered the director of the technical office, Zhang Fulin, to send technician Shen Caiyi to investigate. They are now actively drawing plans and designs, preparing to build more than 40 new prison rooms. The construction cost is 60,000 yuan. The High Court has agreed to allocate 10,000 yuan. Lu Bohong, a philanthropist in Shanghai, has also generously agreed to donate 14,000 yuan. Warden Han also plans to auction off the base and buildings of the prison branch office west of the county government, which is estimated to be worth 10,000 yuan. The rest will be raised locally, and there is considerable certainty. Yesterday, the county government suddenly received an order from the High Court to transfer Warden Han to Zhenjiang, and Kong Xianglin was appointed to fill the vacancy in Wuxi. The new and old wardens are required to take over on October 1st. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan has already transferred the order to Warden Han to handle the closing affairs. The matter of adding new prisons will still proceed as usual. It is heard that the High Court transferred Han to Zhenjiang this time because Zhenjiang is also adding new prisons, and all the plans are entrusted to Han to handle.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Rice Industry Deduction Dispute Reconciled Again <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The local rice and bean industry has always had a 99 deduction for consignment sales, that is, one fen is deducted for every yuan. This year, the trade association decided to change the 99 deduction to 98.4, but the rice merchants in the Beiting section expressed opposition and were in a confrontation with the Sanliqiao section. Although various parties have been running around to mediate, the stalemate has not been resolved due to the extreme positions of both sides. Zhao Zixin, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, seeing the situation, believed that the long-term unresolved dispute would be extremely detrimental to the reputation of the industry. Therefore, he specially sent someone to Suzhou to invite Zhou Hongqing, a standing committee member of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce and a rice industry tycoon, to Wuxi for mediation. Zhou arrived in Wuxi yesterday and is staying in Room 26 of the Railway Hotel. He has contacted Chen Zilin, the leader of the rice industry in the Beiting section of our county, once and has scheduled to convene both parties at the Miscellaneous Grain Association today to carry out mediation work and jointly seek solutions.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Nanhui Pirates Rob Official Salt Ship, Resist Arrest and Fight <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>At Donghai Beach in Laogang Town, this county, a large motorized sailboat suddenly arrived the day before yesterday. It was said to be from Yuyao, fully loaded with over one thousand five hundred packages of official salt, intending to sail to Liuhe. Unexpectedly, when it sailed across the Nicheng waters of this county, five pirates, all armed with box guns, swarmed onto the ship, confining the eleven boatmen in the front cabin. The pirates then steered the ship to a mooring point. The pirates went ashore and declared that they had several packages of private salt and were willing to sell them at reduced prices. At that time, Zhu Dongkui's wife from the town, and the female owner of the Nanshan Hall pharmacy, nicknamed Little White, were willing to promote the sale. Just as they were unloading the salt packages, they were discovered by the anti-smuggling patrol team stationed at Huangjia Road, who immediately dispatched police to arrest them. They also rushed to report to the tax police branch in this city, and telegraphed the Lujiahui and Datuan branches to assist in the arrest. When the tax police from each team arrived at the town, the pirates, seeing the situation was unfavorable, took the initiative and opened fire. The tax police immediately returned fire, and after a fierce battle for about half an hour, the pirates were unable to hold out and jumped into the water to escape. Zhu Dongkui's wife was shot and wounded on the spot. The ship was seized by the police and escorted to Liuhe.</p>

<p>The Baimao Tang dike suffered from severe erosion due to the hurricane and strong tidal surge that passed through the area the day before yesterday. Over the past few days, more than two hundred zhang [~667 meters] of the dike have gradually collapsed.

The district office has reported to the county government and requested an appropriation to repair the dike to protect the farmland.</p>

<p>The Sanyu seawall in Nantong was breached by tidal surges, causing severe flooding and a disastrous situation. Chen Yizhong, the director of the public security bureau, surveyed the disaster situation on the 14th and reported to the county government, stating that seawater had overflowed the dikes and multiple breaches had occurred. At one point, floodwaters raged, turning the Dongyu, Jinnan, and Dadong districts into a swamp. The nearly ripe cotton and bean crops in the disaster area were submerged by the tidal surge. Many houses were also destroyed. Countless children drowned, and pigs, sheep, chickens, and dogs were almost entirely wiped out. The victims, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, were left homeless, crying by the roadside, begging for food, their plight too miserable to describe. Fortunately, the tidal surge has now gradually receded. Workers are being supervised to rush to repair the breaches and provide post-disaster relief.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Inspectors in Huzhou Paraded Through the Streets as a Warning <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Yongfengrun Cloth Store in this city recently had eight boxes of factory cloth shipped from Shanghai via Lixing. On the afternoon of the twelfth, coolies were hired to transport them. While passing the Kaitai Mat Store entrance at the Zidiling intersection on North Street, they were stopped by anti-Japanese association inspectors Zhu Baoshun, Zhu Baoxing, Cai Zhaogen, and others, who ordered the coolies to stop, intending to open the boxes for inspection. The coolies said that if they wanted to inspect, they should open them inside the store, as it was not convenient on the road. While they were arguing, a clerk from the Kaitai Mat Store, surnamed Zhu, said from the side that the boxes did not contain money, and if they did, the inspectors would be very happy. The inspectors, upon hearing this, harbored a grudge. They followed the coolies to the Yongfengrun Cloth Store and watched them open the boxes. When it was confirmed that they contained factory cloth, the inspectors withdrew. They returned to the entrance of the Kaitai Mat Store and brutally beat the clerk Zhu, causing injuries. Shop clerks from nearby stores, seeing this, rose up in indignation and dragged Zhu, Cai, and others to the National Salvation Association. As the Kaitai store clerk Zhu was a member of the Dongxi Pu fire brigade, the members of the brigade convened a meeting of fire brigades from various districts in the county chamber of commerce, proposing four conditions: (1) The anti-Japanese association's income and expenditure accounts should be made public; (2) The offending inspectors should be dismissed; (3) An apology should be made to the residents near Zidiling; (4) The offenders should be paraded through the streets as a warning. The above four items were submitted to the anti-Japanese association for a response. Wu Boyu, the standing chairman of the association, agreed to respond at a meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. Therefore, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, Chairman Wu convened a meeting of representatives from the fire brigade at the anti-Japanese association to discuss the matter. It was decided that the first item would be implemented after the accounts were cleared, the second item would be implemented, the third item would be waived, and for the fourth item, plainclothes police officers would escort the offending inspectors through the streets. The representatives considered this satisfactory. At 5:00 PM, Chief Inspector Lin of the Public Security Bureau led several plainclothes police officers, escorting Zhu Baoshun, Zhu Baoxun, and Cai Zhaogen, among others, from the meeting venue directly to Zidiling, then to North Street, past Caifengfang, and other places, parading them around for a week before returning.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Poor Autumn Silkworm Harvest in Deqing <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the authorities have spared no effort in improving silkworm varieties. However, in rural areas, the adoption of improved varieties often does not yield as good results as local varieties, and most of them die midway. Deqing County has recently discovered this problem, which is attributed to the improper handling of the guiding director Huang Weimin and others. An appeal has been sent to the chairman of the Lake Society. The original telegram reads: "On August 6th, our county received 5,000 sheets of Tanguan brand autumn silkworm eggs from the Cuisheng seed production farm, issued by the Department of Construction, designated improved areas, distributed to the people, and assigned guiding director Huang Weimin and instructors to guide them in the villages. This demonstrates the great concern for the people's livelihood by the director of the Department of Construction of Zhejiang. The villagers, compelled by livelihood, competed to buy them, even resorting to pawning, borrowing, or even selling green seedlings and mulberry leaves for next spring. Unexpectedly, during the third or fourth instar stage, the silkworms did not molt uniformly, their sizes varied, and their bodies gradually withered. Upon checking the symptoms, it was found that the seeds contained a virus, which was due to the negligence of the guiding director Huang Weimin and the section chief of the construction section, Xu Sicong, who delayed the receipt of the seeds for three days and did not immediately unpack them and place them in a cool place, resulting in the silkworm eggs being heated. As a result, the autumn silkworms died completely. However, the villagers suffered great labor and financial losses. How should they be compensated? Your society is concerned about our hometown. Please do your best to find a solution and quickly telegraph the Department of Construction of Zhejiang to order the seed production farm to compensate for the losses and to severely punish the Yellow Director Weimin Xu and Section Chief Sicong who delayed the silkworm seeds to appease the people's debts. Respectfully awaiting orders. Representatives of silkworm farmers in the silkworm mulberry improvement area of Deqing County, Shen, sincerely bows."</p>

<p>Yunnan Association Receives Telegram from Yunnan Chairman</p>
<p>The Yunnan Association is organized by influential Yunnan and Kang provinces expatriates who are extremely concerned about the southwest border defense, cultural construction, and politics. The strength of the neighboring provinces necessitates caution. A slight misstep can bring about the pain of national subjugation. Tibetan guards have already yielded. Since the September 18th Incident, the Yunnan border and Xikang have repeatedly sounded alarms. The severity of the situation rivals that of the Northeast. The military in the provinces is engaged in internal strife. The central and southeastern regions are too distant to provide support, rendering them unable to plan border defense. As a result, the nation's territory shrinks by the mile, fostering unchecked growth. Recently, Zhongdian fell for several days and has yet to be recovered. Zhongdian connects the three provinces of Yunnan, Kang, and Tibet, and serves as Yunnan's main route into Tibet. It is an important military position that links with Atunzi and Lijiang, shielding western Yunnan. Unfortunately, due to being constrained by Liu of Sichuan, the local garrison was weak and overrun by thousands of Tibetans carrying the latest weapons. The entire territory fell, shaking Yunnan and Kang. Five or six days ago, the Shanghai Yunnan Association received this news and convened board members Xu Han, Song Chongjiu, Hu Zhongming, Feng Ruji, and others for discussion. It was decided to first telegraph Yunnan Chairman Long Yun and urge the provincial government to earnestly plan border defense and recover the territory by a set deadline. Yesterday morning, the association received an urgent telegram from Yunnan Chairman Long stating: "To the Yunnan Association, Jinshenfu Road, Shanghai, upon receiving the Blue Telegram, we have learned that thousands of unruly bandits have gathered in Zhongdian, and the county seat is indefensible, leading to its fall. We have received a telegram from Dalian Director Shi Hua stating that Independent Battalion Commander Li Congshan has led his troops to assist. The headquarters fears that the bandits are numerous and the troops are insufficient, so we have telegraphed Dalian to instruct Liu Brigade and Bu Corps to send the entire Third Battalion to assist in the suppression, and approve that Director Shi may, if necessary, deploy the Long Battalion stationed in Yongsheng to provide support. Also, the bandits are wearing military uniforms, suggesting a mastermind. We have telegraphed the General Staff Headquarters of the Central Government to request one or two fighter planes to be dispatched to the battlefield to investigate the bandits' rear situation to clarify the truth. Gentlemen, your distant inquiries demonstrate your concern for your hometown. This is a telegram in reply, expressing our gratitude. Long Yun bows, et cetera." It is reported that the association, considering the severity of the situation and its impact on national defense and the safety of Yunnan and Kang, will convene a board meeting on the 17th (Sunday) to discuss concrete measures.</p>

Liu Hongsheng has already spent more than 43,000 yuan to repair and modify the Yangzi Wharf. The first 11,200 bales of cotton will be unloaded in the warehouses at that wharf. Subsequent large shipments of American cotton will also be stored in that warehouse.</p>

<p>After returning to Shanghai from Lushan, Minister Song recently conferred with Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, and others, leaders of Chinese cotton mills, at his residence on Qiqi Road regarding the purchase of American cotton by Chinese cotton mills and the rescue of Chinese cotton yarn. They merely exchanged views and did not make any specific decisions. Chinese cotton mills believe that this year's domestic cotton harvest is abundant, but the domestic yarn market remains sluggish, with accumulated yarn. Spinning yarn will inevitably result in losses. They hope to receive discounts on the price of American cotton and find ways to reduce the amount of stored yarn in order to reduce costs for the Chinese cotton mills.</p>

<h3 id="e117">A Glimpse of the Venue <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The exhibition venue is located between Penglai Road and Yongning Street in Ximen. Three pine and cypress arches were erected along the road, serving as the main entrances and exits. The venue is filled with temporary stores set up by various factories, displaying a wide variety of goods that are dazzling to the eye. Ladies from all walks of life were enthusiastically purchasing goods. In the center of the venue is a large ceremonial platform, with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the middle and national flags on both sides. The center of the platform is reserved for the chairman and representatives from various sectors, with the record-keeping area on the right and the press area on the left. Two bottles of flowers are placed on the ceremonial table, creating a simple and orderly arrangement. Above the platform hangs the large banner of the China Products Improvement Society with the four characters "National Goods Save the Nation", which is particularly striking. The perimeter of the venue is maintained by police officers from the Public Security Bureau, as well as members of the Wu Yu, East Asia, and Boy Scouts.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Unveiling and Flag-Raising <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the Public Security Bureau military band played music to open the meeting. The members of the presidium, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Hanliang, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yilu, Chen Binghui, Liu Zhongying, Yu Zhongxian, and representatives from various party, government, and military circles entered the venue in an orderly fashion. Then, Jiang Huaishu, representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, unveiled the curtain in front of the platform, triggering thunderous applause from the audience. Next, under the leadership of the presidium, Mayor Wu's representative, Yu Hongjun, successively stepped down from the platform and walked to the tall flagpole planted in front of the gate. As the military music played a melodious tune, Yu held the long rope and hoisted the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag into the air, where it fluttered in the wind, which was quite magnificent. The citizens in the audience applauded and cheered. After the flag-raising ceremony, they returned to the presidium platform to hold the opening ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Chairman's Report <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The presidium elected Wang Hanliang to give a report, which stated in brief: "Today, the First Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai and the China National Products Manufacturers' Federation are holding the National Goods Movement Exhibition here. We are honored to have so many guests participating. The purpose of holding this exhibition, of course, is to promote national goods. I hope that all compatriots will from now on buy national goods and not buy foreign goods, especially goods from enemy countries. You must know that most of the enemy's warships, planes, guns, and cannons are paid for with the money that flows out from our purchase of foreign goods. Therefore, the Chinese people must work together to preserve our money, purchase national goods, and expand our military equipment to increase our national strength, et cetera."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Speeches From All Walks of Life <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Next, representatives from all walks of life gave speeches. (1) Jiang Huaishu from the Municipal Party Headquarters stated in brief: "The purpose of holding the National Goods Movement Exhibition is to promote national goods. When I heard the four words 'promote national goods,' I felt very heartbroken. May I ask how many national goods can be seen in the Shanghai market? Everywhere you look, you only see foreign goods. Whether it's for use or consumption, foreign goods are indispensable. The Chinese people's psychology of favoring foreign goods has reached such a point, how can the country not be weak and be bullied by others? Therefore, I propose that the products produced by every national goods factory should first be strictly inspected by the municipal chamber of commerce to determine whether the raw materials are national goods, and then be allowed to be sold on the market. Then, the citizens who love to use national goods will not mistakenly buy foreign goods, et cetera." (2) Yu Hongjun from the Municipal Government stated in brief: "At this time when the national crisis is serious and the people's livelihood is declining, everyone knows that promoting national goods is the only good policy to save the country. Because promoting national goods is the only way to open up a path for the Chinese nation and reverse the bankruptcy of rural areas. If the Chinese nation can revive and the rural economy does not go bankrupt, then all undertakings can be carried out boldly. This is the meaning of opening this National Goods Movement Exhibition today. At the same time, I also feel that there are two necessary conditions for promoting national goods: (1) The entire Chinese nation must thoroughly awaken; (2) All citizens must cooperate. Only in this way can we achieve the true goal of promoting national goods and not betray the meaning of today's meeting." (3) Ji Zejin from the Ministry of Industry said: "Opening this National Goods Exhibition today is of great significance. Since the beginning of trade with foreign countries, the entire market in the country has been filled with foreign goods. Whether it's everything we use in our daily lives, such as foreign cloth, foreign paper, foreign oil, foreign matches, foreign lamps, foreign porcelain, they are all foreign goods. It is even shameful that we, a country based on agriculture, are eating foreign rice and foreign wheat. The money of our country is being taken away by foreigners, how can our country not be poor? Therefore, to save the country, we must promote national goods. To promote national goods, we must first concentrate all national goods in one place, openly exhibit them, and jointly study and improve them to seek progress. This is the purpose of our National Goods Exhibition. This National Goods Exhibition is like setting up an introduction agency, specializing in introducing national goods to the Chinese people, so that the Chinese people can recognize national goods and non-national goods, and telling the Chinese people to use national goods and use less foreign goods. We hope that this exhibition will be held in major cities in the interior from Shanghai, and even in major cities in Europe and America to develop foreign trade. Then, this will be in line with the future of our country's industry, which is unlimited. Recently, Singapore will be preparing to hold an overseas national goods exhibition. If our country's goods factories can export national goods to the exhibition as much as possible, this is also an excellent opportunity to promote national goods overseas. I recently had a conversation with Mr. Kao, the Canadian Commercial Counselor, who said that the Canadian National Exhibition in Ottawa and the French National Exhibition in Paris are held once a year. We very much hope that our country will participate, but our country has never paid attention to it. In the future, I hope that national goods merchants will cooperate with the government and actively participate in these exhibitions at that time, so that although Chinese national goods cannot compete with them in foreign countries, they can gain an overseas market, which is not without benefit to the future of our country." Speakers who followed included Wu Huanru from the Social Affairs Bureau, Ye Jiaxing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ye Xianggao from the General Trade Union, and Mao Yong from the Second Special District Court (summaries omitted). Finally, Wang Xiaolai from the presidium gave a reply, stating in brief: "Today's opening of this National Goods Movement Exhibition is to promote national goods. However, the best way to promote national goods is not to buy (things). By 'things,' I mean goods from Eastern and Western countries. If we don't buy goods from Eastern and Western countries, then what (things) will dare to bully us? Therefore, I hope that the citizens will not go to buy (things) and buy national goods, et cetera."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Oath and Tour <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>After Wang finished his reply, everyone stood up straight, raised their right hands high, and unanimously swore to use national goods. The oath read: "We swear with sincerity to use national goods to fulfill our national duties. Having sworn, we will never change. We swear." After the oath, the presidium led leaders from various sectors on a tour of the factories' displays. After a light refreshment, they took photos and dispersed.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Declaration of the Local Cloth Movement Conference <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The declaration of the Shanghai Local Cloth Movement Conference states: "When it comes to saving the country today, those who talk are not as good as those who act, and those who aim far are not as good as those who plan for immediate success. Instead of seeking benefits for the people that are difficult to achieve, it is better to focus on their existing businesses and give them practical benefits, so as to save them in the present. We are initiating the Local Cloth Movement Conference amidst the severe national crisis and the collapse of the countryside. Some say that the momentum of the domestic goods movement is already on the rise, so why not plan and proceed in the direction of domestic goods, instead of dwelling only on local cloth? If not, set up factories and machinery for large-scale weaving plans to compete with imported cloth. If we don't consider this and only seek to expand handicrafts, isn't that out of touch with the times? There is nothing more wrong than this. They don't know that hand-woven local cloth is originally a handicraft unique to our Jiangsu Province. During leisure time from farming, weaving provides income to supplement the inadequacy of agricultural income. The sound of looms is heard in the neighborhood. Since the prevalence of foreign cloth, spinning and weaving have been cut off, and since the secondary industry has been cut off, the farmers' difficulties have become more serious. The reason for this is that there is no market for local cloth, and because the people of the country do not like to wear local cloth. We believe that the current domestic goods movement is being vigorously promoted, and local cloth is also a kind of domestic goods. We may as well take advantage of the situation to guide it, plan to improve it, and expand its sales. A great river does not abandon small streams, and mountains are based on plains. We hope that it will also be permitted by all enthusiastic patriots. As for the preparations, the matter is extremely simple. We will lend yarn and value to the original handicraft skills and original spinning and weaving equipment in the countryside to buy their finished products and promote their sales in the market. With a wave of the hand, the countryside already has a secondary industry to speak of, and the countryside already has hope for salvation. This is something that we can do, and it is not like a large-scale weaving factory that requires purchasing land, building houses, machinery and equipment, and raising assets. Our humble intention has always been to resist inferior goods and relieve the suffering of rural areas. We only hope that all patriotic gentlemen will rise up and advocate wearing it, then we will be fortunate."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Japanese Consul Demands to Transfer Jinshui Mountain, Public Security Bureau Refuses <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Already Sent to the Garrison Headquarters for Interrogation</p>
<p>A Korean named Liu Yinfa, who became an American citizen and resided in the Lanxin Lane of Diswei Road, was suddenly shot in his residence a few days ago. The murderer was a young Korean. Subsequently, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Shanghai, Zuozhi Duozhu, and Goto Gentaro, a criminal from the Special High Police Section of the Police Department, together with the Fifth District Police Station, sent personnel to the Yisun ship in the Sixteenth Pier to arrest a suspect named Jinshui Mountain, who was temporarily detained in the Water Patrol Team. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau interrogated him in order to find out the truth. People in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, paid close attention to this case because it involved a political background.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Denies the Murder <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to Jinshui Mountain's statement to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, he is 24 years old, his father's name is Jin Doutian, he is from Guangdong, and his mother, Huang, is Korean. He is currently serving as a special service chief in the Heavy Artillery Company of the Training Team of the Army Artillery School in Dingjiaqiao, Nanjing, with signature business cards and private seals as proof. During the January 28th Shanghai War, he came to Shanghai to participate in the battle and has a commemorative intention of the 19th Route Army's Shanghai War as proof. In June, the Nanjing team had a summer vacation, so he came to Shanghai and resided in the home of his friend Liu Xiong in Dongyouheng Road, which has been two months so far. This time, he took a ship back to Guangdong because of something, and was suddenly arrested on the ship. He doesn't know the reason for the arrest. When asked about the Liu Yinfa case, he claimed that he knew nothing about it and firmly denied the murder. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau then summoned Chen Lu, Liu Yinfa's housekeeper, to testify that the murderer was not this person at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Refuse to Transfer <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since Jinshui Mountain was arrested, the Japanese consulate immediately prepared a document and sent personnel to request the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to allow the transfer. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau refused to transfer him on the grounds that Jinshui Mountain was a Chinese citizen and an active serviceman, and there was no evidence of the murder, so he was sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, at the Hepingmen Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Locomotive No. B-37, towing mud-carrying vehicles, drove out from the mud-transport branch line. Two of the rear wheels of the locomotive suddenly derailed and fell. The Nanjing Station dispatched craftsmen on a rescue train to repair it. At around 12:00 PM, the derailed locomotive was put back on track, and a test run was immediately conducted. Unexpectedly, the branch line, because it was made of old materials and had been in disrepair for many years, was showing signs of being unable to bear the load. Therefore, during the test run, the four front wheels of Locomotive No. 37 derailed again and fell between the main and branch lines, causing traffic to be blocked. Further repairs were carried out, and it was completed at around 3:00 PM. Therefore, the ninth express train from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday was delayed by more than two hours.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Shocking New Japanese Barracks <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Open to the Public Yesterday</p>
<p>The Engineering is Truly Great</p>
<p>What are the Thoughts of the Chinese People?</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters in Shanghai has become increasingly active. It demolished the old barracks and rebuilt a new, modern, and solid permanent large barracks on the original site at the end of North Sichuan Road, opposite Hongkou Park. Construction began in November of last year and was completed at the beginning of this month. A military hospital was also built next to the west side of the road and was completed at the same time. The Japanese Marine Corps authorities specially received Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters at 2:00 PM yesterday, allowing them to go to visit freely, and guided them to visit all levels on the surface for a week. The engineering is truly great, but a fleeting glance is not enough to see its mystery. Military secrets are even more out of the question. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e137">A Glimpse of the Bottom Layer <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The reporters drove to the end of North Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM and got off in front of the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters. The sentry with guns asked in Japanese whether they were newspaper reporters. A messenger soldier collected name cards one by one and invited them into a room to wait for a while. After the reporters entered the room, they first looked out the window to observe the outline of the building. The towering four-story building is styled somewhat like the Continental Shopping Mall on Nanjing Road and Jiujiang Road, but it is a three-sided encirclement. The middle is a square that can accommodate hundreds of soldiers for vertical and horizontal exercises. The bottom layer is generally equipped with armored vehicles, tanks, light artillery vehicles, machine guns, machine feet vehicles, military transport vehicles, military vehicles, etc. At that time, a large number of transport vehicles were carrying countless rectangular wooden boxes. The appearance was like the new barracks of the Japanese Marine Corps (photographed by Li Zunyong).</p>
<p>Like coffins in the army, hundreds of soldiers unloaded them one by one from the cars and moved them upstairs. According to Japanese reporters, after the soldiers' bedding is bundled, every three sets are placed in a wooden box, which is used as tables and chairs during the day, which is also very convenient for transportation. These hundreds of soldiers had just arrived in Shanghai from Japan and were about to be transferred to Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Visit Layer by Layer <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>While observing, the messenger soldier invited Mr. Kashiwagi Setsu, a translator in casual Western clothing, to bow and greet them and invite them upstairs. The escalators can accommodate five or six people walking side by side. The cement steps are unusually flat, and the copper handrails are unusually flat. The internal form is a surrounding corridor, which is also quite wide. The west side is all inner rooms. The offices and rooms of important personnel such as the commander and the staff are all on the first floor. The second and third floors are gradually dormitories for middle and lower-level officers and soldiers. The windows on all sides along the road are very small. Judging from its walls, it is strangely thick, and the power of shells is not capable of igniting it. Under the leadership of the translator, reporters and others took a quick look and had no time to observe in detail. There are several doors that are shaped like gates and are equipped with huge locks. I don't know what is hidden inside. There are no signs outside the door, and there is no way to see its mystery.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Rooftop View <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Finally, to the rooftop, wide can accommodate Thousands of people, junior soldiers, sit Under the sun, operating chores very diligently. Since the January 28th Incident, reporters have inspected the inside of Japanese soldiers many times, and they all have this impression. There are no idle pastimes like those of our country's soldiers after a full meal. The watchtower is built here, with the flag of the rising sun flying in the wind. One day, a soldier at the top of the platform carried out his watch work. Its height is said to be one hundred feet from the ground. Next to the watchtower is a shrine for soldiers to worship. Two or three of our compatriots are still building it. The style is small, and it is made into a rockery shape, and then a wooden merchant is built on top of it. Next to the shrine is a monument commemorating the January 28th Incident, with an inscription on the monument that says, (Shanghai Marine Corps Recruitment Society), followed by (Written by Marshal Earl Togo Heihachiro on July 7th), written by Japanese Marshal Togo to commemorate the Marine Corps soldiers annihilated by the 19th Route Army on January 28th.</p>
<h3 id="e140">No Secrets <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>After the visit of each layer has been completed, a An exit from the floor, placed high The shooting machine gun is like the place where he first climbed to the roof, because he realized that the flat and solid roof is not only able to shoot machine guns, but also install several heavy artillery guns to freely destroy this great Shanghai. After going downstairs, resting in the reception room on the bottom floor, a glass of soda and a few cigarettes, the translator answered questions from guests at will. The former staff officer, Kakuda, although he did not know anything except Japanese, also represented Commander Sugiyama to socialize with Chinese and foreign reporters and guests, shaking hands and saluting very busy. According to him and translator Kashiwagi Setsu, there is no such thing as a ground-level building, and there are no secrets.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Densely Packed Wires <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>There is a radio on the roof that receives sound. Pole, ground wires crisscross densely It is also arranged, and it has not been fully installed There are also. Above the atrium, the power lines are as dense as spiderwebs. On the left side of the lower floor, there is a room for the general receiving and dispatching office of the telegraph, which is also being equipped with various machines. There is also a Japanese sign posted outside the door strictly prohibiting entry, which shows the strictness of its communication network. The soldiers' lives are completely scientific. When entering the cafeteria, they must disinfect and wash their hands. The training of sports is even stricter, with special sports rooms and wrestling rooms. The discipline is strict and sufficient for our people to learn.</p>

<p>After the reporters quit, Fu Cheng Kakuda Staff's good intentions, guide Across Huanglu Road to the same completion of the Naval Hospital for inspection, the building is also four stories, but the location is very narrow, covering only a few acres, compared with the large barracks, there are large and small witches. From the lowest floor are the office, pharmacy, diagnosis and surgery rooms, floor by floor, set up venereal disease, ophthalmology, dentistry, infectious disease, and other treatment rooms, and dozens of large and small sick rooms. Although the house is newly built, the large and small wards are already crowded with beds. The reporters saw that the notices written on the walls and the nurses' reports were consistent with the phenomenon of overcrowded wards. The rumor in Japanese newspapers that many of the Shanghai Marine Corps suffered from dysentery is not false.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Construction Process <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>

At the top floor of the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Doulean Road, there is a watchtower, about sixty feet high, which can be used to command the entire army to fight. The construction of the camp began in November last year, and it took only six months to complete. The drawings of the barracks were drawn by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy, and special commissioners and technicians were sent to Shanghai to supervise the construction. All materials were transported to Shanghai by transport ships specially sent by the Ministry of the Navy, without freight charges or taxes. However, the price has reached more than 1.5 million Japanese gold. The hospital's house is also four stories high, fully equipped, and the cost is huge. When the reporter returned and wrote this, he felt a myriad of emotions, and his hands trembled and his heart broke.</p>
<h3 id="e144">China Merchants Bureau Ship Supervisors Resist Handover, Bureau Compels Implementation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau General Manager Liu Hongsheng's dismissal of ship supervisors has provoked opposition from the Seamen's Union and resistance from the supervisors, which has been delayed for months. Now that the Ministry of Communications has issued an order, it will be forcibly implemented yesterday. A dispute may come to an end. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Supervisors Resist <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The ship supervisors to be replaced include Jianghua, Jiangyu, Jiangxin, Jiangda, and Xinjiangtian, a total of six ships. Huongsheng, according to the public presentation of the crew members of each ship and the investigation by the personnel, should apply to the board of directors for approval and issue a bureau order in late July for implementation. Among them, the two ships, Xinjiangtian and Jianghua, resisted the most fiercely. At first, the preparatory committee of the Seamen's Union came forward to oppose it, and then resisted the handover, causing the successors to be unable to take over. In the past two months, the supervisors have even feigned illness and have not gone to the ship, and have sent their wives to the ship to take over their duties in order to resist the implementation of the transfer in a passive way. The bureau believed that women on board were not in good shape, so it took compulsory measures.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Ministry Order Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>After the preparatory committee of the Seamen's Union opposed the matter, Liu Hongsheng turned to the Ministry of Communications to state the reasons for adjusting the crew and transferring the supervisors in order to reorganize the shipping affairs. On the 14th, the Ministry of Communications issued a reply, which has arrived at the bureau, saying that the bureau's adjustment of personnel in order to rectify shipping affairs is a duty that should be handled, how can others come out to obstruct it, which hinders the bureau's administration. The general manager's transfer of ship supervisors is approved. However, the preparatory committee of the Seamen's Union must be properly replied to. This is of the utmost importance. After the Ministry's order arrived at the bureau, General Manager Liu immediately complied with it and ordered the supervisors who resisted to hand over their duties.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Compulsory Execution <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Among the ships, Jianghua supervisor Zhang Jinxian resisted the most strongly. Recently, because the bureau limited the handover of duties and the handover of public property in the ship, Zhang faked illness and did not arrive, and sent his wife to the ship to work. The bureau could not bear it any longer, so it ordered the shipping department to notify Jiangyu supervisor Fan Xinbiao to prepare to take over Jianghua's supervisor duties. However, because Zhang Jinsheng avoided meeting and refused to hand over, the bureau notified the Water Public Security Team on the 14th and sent many police officers to the Jianghua ship at the South Bund Pier. Under the surveillance of the water police, the public property of the supervisor's department was taken out for inspection and handed over to the new supervisor Fan Xinbiao for safekeeping to carry out his mission. If there is any missing public property, Zhang will still have to be recovered from Zhang, and Zhang Jinsheng, who resisted the order, was reassigned to Jiangyu as a supervisor, and he was forced to hand over.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Reply to the Union <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The supervisor of Xinjiangtian also resisted the handover and is now being handled by Liu Hongsheng together. Xinjiangtian now needs to be suspended and sent to the factory for major repairs, with Xin Ming acting as a substitute. During the suspension period, the supervisor is ordered to hand over, otherwise, the police will be sent to forcibly hand over in accordance with the Jianghua precedent. On one side, the bureau replied to the Seamen's Union, stating that the dispute, which had been delayed for more than a month, has been resolved in accordance with the order of the ministry.</p>

<p>Mr. Fager, director of the Nice Observatory and member of the French Paris Bureau of Longitudes, arrived in Shanghai on the Baodaos ship yesterday morning and will cooperate with the International Longitude Conference to re-determine the latitude of various places. The measurement of this longitude takes Algeria in Africa, Xujiahui in Shanghai, and San Diego in the United States as the basic measurement stations. It was measured once in 1926, and it will be re-measured this year. The results obtained can also prove whether the theory of continental drift is true. It is said that the French will stay in Shanghai for three months and will be staying at the Xujiahui Observatory.</p>

<p>Inquiry into the Source of Private Letters</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Bao, the Japanese newspaper in Shanghai, Shanghai Japanese Daily News, learned about the private letters of Sir Ma Lai, a leader of the anti-war conference. This morning, Ma Lai and Klein, a representative of the Japanese Daily News, discussed it again at the Huamao Hotel residence. Jafferlin, the Shanghai Postmaster, was also present. Ma reiterated Klein's previous claim that the newspaper authorities had a copy of Ma Lai's letter to a certain American woman in Siberia on August 31, as well as a photo of Ma Lai's letter to Litvinov, and a copy of Schmedley's letter from Berlin to Shanghai. Klein denied that he had said anything about the letter to Litvinov, but he was immediately refuted by others present, who said that they had personally heard him say it at the time. Ma Lai then produced the original draft of the letter to the American woman, the content of which was the hope that he could meet in Piroppiyang in October. Ma Lai also explained that the letter referred to the Jewish colonization of Poland and the Soviet Union, because a meeting had been agreed upon in advance. Afterwards, Jafferlin explained that within the Chinese Post Office, the security was strict, and it was almost impossible for the contents of the letter to be leaked. Ma Lai also produced a letter from the manager of the Huamao Hotel, denying the possibility that the hotel servants could open the letters privately, and pointed out that these letters were often transferred to Siberia via Japan. Afterwards, Ma Lai drafted a memorandum in front of the reporter of this newspaper as the basis for writing another letter to the editor of the Japanese Daily News, and said that he reserved the right to take further action. If there is legal action in the future, the Chinese postal authorities are willing to participate in it, and Jafferlin will also investigate the Japanese Daily News to clarify the truth. In addition, Ma Lai also denied that he had written to Litvinov. Finally, Ma Lai wrote to the editor of the Japanese Daily News, asking him to explain the source of his letter to the American woman.</p>

<h3 id="e153">New Regulations for Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Tax Administration Issues Announcement Yesterday</p>
<p>Order Seven Provinces and Regions to Comply</p>
<p>The Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance issued an announcement yesterday on the taxation of tobacco and alcohol throughout the country in accordance with the new regulations, saying, "For the purpose of announcement, after investigation, the opening of public sales of tobacco and alcohol has been going on for many years, but the results have not been obvious, and long-standing malpractices have become increasingly serious. The reason for this is that although the tax system may not be perfect, the collusion between merchants and contractors is the biggest reason. Once the collecting agency contracts out the tax amount, it only holds those who are subcontracted accountable for the amount, and no longer asks about how it is collected. After the merchants contract, they only know how to allocate the amount and use it for private purposes. The tax rates and regulations are just a formality. As a result, superiors and subordinates deceive each other and肆其侵蝕The loopholes in it are inextricable. Since this Administration was ordered to concurrently operate the tobacco and alcohol tax, it has been observing the situation in various provinces for a year and deeply knows where the crux lies. If the system of layers of contracting is not abolished, it is not enough to talk about rectification. This time, the native tobacco leaves are subject to special tax, and the native wine is changed to a fixed-amount tax, which focuses on clearing up long-standing malpractices and verifying and auditing. Within the seven provinces and regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian, all native tobacco leaves that have paid the special tax must be filled in with a tax payment certificate. As for the affixing of stamps on packages, native wines that have paid the fixed-amount tax, in addition to the tax payment certificates for retail sales that should be cut and retained, the part of the container must be affixed with a tax payment certificate. In this way, the foundation of innovation is established, and the evil practices of contractors must be prohibited. In short, after the implementation of the new regulations, the collecting agencies should abide by the regulations and earnestly implement them, and must not follow the old story of recruiting merchants and contracting. Merchants must also not collude with collecting personnel to allocate taxes to merchants. If both parties continue to do things as usual and there are still things, once discovered or accused, they will be severely punished and will not be lenient. I am afraid that many other merchants are not aware of it, so I hereby clarify the original intention of the reform and earnestly inform everyone so that everyone knows it. The various凛遵 shall not violate this announcement."</p>

<p>Mr. Wourcel, Polish Commercial Counselor, specially visited Mr. He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, at the site of the New Customs Bureau yesterday. According to a large company in the country, which needs a large amount of rattan material, he specifically asked the bureau to solicit export merchants to contact. If there are any exporters who are in this business, they can contact the guidance office of the bureau for contact and introduction. According to Mr. He, Minnan in our country produces a lot of rattan, most of which is used for domestic manufacturing of rattan wares, and a small amount is also transported for export. According to the customs report book, according to the statistics of last year (21st year), China's export of rattan peel and rattan core totaled 3,543 dan, worth关金38,353 yuan, most of which was transported to India, Hong Kong, and Macau, and occasionally to Germany, the United States, and other places. If domestic rattan can be exported to Poland this time, there will be one more outlet, which is also a good phenomenon for the development of international trade.</p>

<p>Family of Han Donghui Demands</p>
<h3 id="e157">Suppression of Gold Exchange <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Appeals to City Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>To Preserve Public Tranquility and Uphold Humanitarianism</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Han Donghui from Yuyao, Zhejiang, was suddenly knocked down and died of suffocation by a colleague at the Gold Exchange while negotiating a transaction. His family claims that Han's death was due to the exchange's inadequate facilities and chaotic market conditions. Furthermore, the responsible authorities failed to maintain order, leading to this unfortunate incident. It is also reported that the deceased's wife, Mrs. Han Hong, appealed to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting a severe crackdown to maintain public tranquility and console the departed soul. The original petition is recorded below: A petition regarding the Gold Exchange's negligence of duties, disruption of order, tragic loss of life, and concealment of the perpetrator, requesting a thorough investigation and improvement to uphold humanitarianism and ensure public tranquility. My husband, Han Donghui, used to frequent the Gold Exchange to negotiate margin trading. On the morning of August 22nd this year, after breakfast, he went to the Gold Exchange market as usual to inquire about market fluctuations. Shortly after leaving home, the news came that my husband had been knocked to the ground in the market, unconscious. He was taken to Renji Hospital by car. Upon hearing the news, I rushed to Renji Hospital, only to find that my husband had already died and his body had been placed in the morgue. In just two hours, he had passed away forever, leaving behind no last words or clear cause of death. As a bereaved woman with no education, I was overwhelmed with fear and at a loss for what to do. Fortunately, with the support of relatives and friends, I managed to arrange the funeral. As my mind began to clear, I felt that my husband was in the prime of his life and could not have died suddenly from a mere collision. I suspected foul play or some other cause. With a body pregnant with his child, I braved the autumn chill, wandering around, hoping to uncover the perpetrator's name and clear his name. Unexpectedly, the Gold Exchange treated this tragedy in their market as a common occurrence. They did not detain the perpetrator at the scene, nor did they report the perpetrator's name afterward. They allowed my husband to die and his child to be orphaned, leaving me, a widow carrying his unborn child, to suffer under economic hardship, with no recourse. Any person with compassion would be saddened by this situation, but it is futile to discuss this with the directors of the Gold Exchange. Later, newspaper reports only mentioned that the person who knocked down my husband was an employee of a certain gold firm, without providing their name or identity. This is all due to the exchange's attempts to cover up the truth, allowing the perpetrator to remain at large. The reason for this concealment is undoubtedly related to the chaotic order and inadequate facilities of the exchange, as reported in the newspapers. The exchange is a place where crowds gather, and its market should be spacious. However, the Gold Exchange's market is an old-fashioned warehouse with a small area and a long, narrow shape. Compared to the yarn and cloth exchange, the securities exchange, and the goods exchange in the same area, its</p>
<h3 id="e158">Equipment Inferiority <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>is as different as heaven and earth. Furthermore, the Gold Exchange has the highest volume of trading and the most intense activity. Every day, from the opening to the closing bell, trading is constant. Unlike the yarn and cloth and securities exchanges, which have separate sessions, those who stand there cannot disperse as they do in other exchanges. The number of brokers, over 130, is the highest among all exchanges. Each broker also has several agents who constantly stand in the market. In a small space, an excessive number of people are crowded together, making it impossible to ensure air circulation and unobstructed passage. My husband was knocked to the ground, and if it were not for the suffocating air, he would not have died of suffocation. My husband's death cannot be attributed to the exchange's failure to pay attention to its facilities. Furthermore, the exchange is a place where public prices are determined, and its order should be strictly maintained. However, because the Gold Exchange's market is too small, it lacks a trading center, making management difficult. Furthermore, the exchange's directors only care about their own interests and disregard public safety, leading to bizarre and uncontrollable situations in the market. Reports indicate that the market is crowded and disorderly during trading hours, to the point of being impenetrable. In the market, there are even those who resort to violence to compete. In this chaotic state, the concept of abiding by the law has long been swept away by the tide of evil.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Seeds of Murderous Intent <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>are sown by adverse circumstances. My husband's death cannot be attributed to the Gold Exchange's failure to pay attention to management. The Gold Exchange, aware of its own weaknesses as described above, fears that the perpetrator will be caught, lawsuits will arise, and public opinion will focus on its negligence in management and facilities. Therefore, the directors responsible for operations turn a deaf ear and blind eye, hoping to make the death case disappear without a trace. The employee of a certain gold firm who harmed my husband, with this tacit protection, can hide in the gold market and enjoy killing. But my whole family suffers. Upon investigation, my husband was killed in the Gold Exchange market, and the perpetrator was an employee of a certain gold firm. The exchange's directors are responsible for managing the entire exchange, and their authority makes investigating the matter as easy as turning their hands. Furthermore, the exchange's directors and the various gold firms are in the same industry, so there is no reason why they cannot find out the name of the employee of a certain gold firm. They only</p>
<h3 id="e160">Fear Casting Pearls Before Swine <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>and dare not publicly report the matter, thus tacitly protecting the perpetrator. I beseech your department, as leaders of the people, to love the people as if they were infants. Under the clear blue sky, there is such a situation. With the thought of alleviating hunger and thirst, please seek the benefit of the entire society. Now, there is a Gold Exchange director who relies on economic power to protect a murderer. I must ask you to investigate rigorously. Furthermore, the exchange's inadequate facilities and negligent management pose a great threat to public safety. I must ask you to take severe measures to suppress it. Therefore, I submit this petition, tearfully requesting your department to thoroughly investigate the matter, as a matter of virtue. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau, Petitioner: Han Hong</p>
<h3 id="e161">Assassin of Shao Wenbin Arrested <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Assassin Zhang Bingrong Confesses to Killing Shao</p>
<p>Claims He Was Instigated by Wang Shilong</p>
<p>Shao Wenbin, formerly a professional storyteller known as "Ma Fu A Liu," resided at No. 19 Zhilan Fang, Kaizi'er Road, French Concession. At the age of fifty, he abandoned his old profession and switched to operating flower gambling businesses, creating deep grudges with others in the same line of work. In addition, the authorities were strictly arresting flower gambling leaders, so Shao dared not stay at home and opened a hostel as a temporary residence. On the afternoon of July 28th this year, Shao finished bathing at Xiaoyao Pool and visited a friend at the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. At 8:00 PM, he left the Far East Hotel, intending to return home for dinner. Unexpectedly, someone was waiting to assassinate him on Huagene Road in the French Concession. When the assassins saw Shao approaching, they suddenly rushed forward and opened fire. Shao hurriedly tried to escape but slipped and fell. He was hit by five bullets and died instantly. Seeing that their goal was achieved, the assassins scattered and fled. One assassin fled north from Hongyun Fang, into the public concession area of ​​Edward Road. He was pursued by someone behind him, so the Chinese and Indian patrol officers of the Xinzha Police Station, who heard the sound, helped to apprehend him. The assassin resisted arrest by shooting. The patrol officers also drew their guns and fired back, causing the assassin to be shot fourteen times and fall at the intersection of Longmen Road. At that time, both sides exchanged gunfire, and stray bullets injured Fan Zhongyi, Hu Ju, Shen Zhaorong, and the elderly woman Tan Zhou, who were sitting and cooling off, in their legs. The Xinzha Police Station sent patrol officers to send the assassin and those injured by stray bullets to Renji Hospital. The assassin died in the hospital due to his serious injuries. Afterward, the French police sent detectives to take Shao's body and the assassin's body to the morgue. The next day, the Second Special District Court sent personnel to examine the bodies. Shao's family collected the body for burial, and the assassin's body was buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall because no family members claimed it. The details have already been recorded in previous reports. After this case occurred, the French police were very strict in arresting the criminals. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Xinzha Police Station in the former New Public Concession arrested Yongren Zhang Bingrong (21 years old) in No. 68 Hongfu Lane on Xinzha Road while searching for bandits. It was found that he was one of the main culprits in the Shao Wenbin assassination case. The French police were immediately notified. Jin Jiulin, the Inspector General of the Special Agency, sent detective Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, and detective Zhang Chunsheng, and others to rush to the Xinzha Police Station and take Zhang back to the police station overnight. It was found that Zhang's original name was Zhang Bingyun. In the spring of the 18th year of the Republic of China, he was detained by the Public Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for trial for the crime of privately possessing firearms and theft. After the trial, he was sentenced to four years and two months of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights on February 25th. He was released last year on November 27th during the general amnesty while serving his sentence in prison. When questioned about the Shao murder case, he admitted it without hesitation. He was immediately taken into custody. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial by Judge Xiong Huicai. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case, saying that the defendant was involved in the assassination of Shao Wenbin on the evening of July 28th and was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station yesterday. The French police transferred him to the case. Because the police station still needs to conduct a detailed investigation to arrest the instigator and accomplices, he requested a postponement of two weeks and temporarily detain the defendant until the investigation is clear before filing a lawsuit. When Zhang Bingrong was questioned, he confessed that he was a painter in the past, but now he has nothing to do and no place to live. He admitted that the murder of Shao was instigated by Wang Shilong, who gathered Chen Changgen, who is still at large, and Shi Sigen, who was killed, and me to assassinate Shao. Shao and Wang are all members of the flower association. Because of their feud, Wang gathered us and promised to give us a salary to eat after the event was completed. The court verified the confession and ordered a postponement of the trial to the 29th for further investigation. The defendant was still detained.</p>

<p>Detains Four Male and Female Criminals</p>
<p>Confiscates Chinese Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>Ren Yushan, a 33-year-old from Hebei, has no permanent occupation. He came to Shanghai from his hometown and rented a residence at No. 235 South Nanlin Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, specializing in selling counterfeit banknotes of the two Chinese banks. Ren established a wholesale organization at home. In addition to employing several salesmen (commonly known as brokers) in this city to go to various yanzike and teahouses and restaurants to negotiate prices, he also transported them to various places outside the city for sale. The price of each hundred yuan of counterfeit money was forty yuan, and the sales were very wide. Ren reaped huge profits, but the matter was not kept secret. Inspector Mei Maosheng of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered it and reported the previous information to the Inspector General. He was approved by Director Wen to order three plainclothes policemen from the first squadron of the police bureau to go to a teahouse within the territory of a certain tea shop in the fourth district of Zhabei with Inspector Mei at about 10 o'clock in the morning. After the informant pointed out the target, Mei took out twenty yuan and pretended to be a seller to negotiate prices with the broker and purchased five counterfeit ten yuan banknotes of the Bank of China for a total of fifty yuan and learned that the selling organization was located at a certain place. Subsequently, the officials and others took the informant back to No. 235 Nanlin Lane, Xinjiang Road, and arrested on the spot the main criminal from Hebei, Ren Yushan, who was selling counterfeit banknotes, and seized a counterfeit ten yuan banknote of the Bank of China and sixteen counterfeit five yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications. He was taken back to the bureau for strict interrogation. According to Ren's confession, he admitted to selling counterfeit banknotes and confessed that he had an accomplice, Cao Bingsen from Zhenjiang (47 years old), who was hiding at No. 11 Daji Road, Xiaoximen, Nanshi. Ren was escorted to the crime scene, accompanied by policemen from the second district, and arrested Cao at about 1 pm. According to Cao's confession, the secret contact point for the counterfeit money organization was set up at No. 30 Aifu Lane, Taiping Bridge, French Concession. The counterfeit money was mostly sold by the main organ. The original case handlers escorted Cao to the French Concession police station, together with Lu Ying, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team, and dispatched detectives Zhao Wenzhong and others. They also dispatched the 12th West Detective and the 108th Chinese Detective to go to the address at 2 pm. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already fled upon hearing the news and disappeared without a trace. After searching, nothing was found, and only the second landlord, Lu Huang, a woman from Danyang (43 years old), and Xu Bingji, a suspect from Anhui, were taken to the bureau for interrogation. In total, four male and female bandits were arrested in the case, along with the counterfeit money, and were sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday morning to be dealt with according to law. It is reported that the bureau will notify the two Chinese banks to investigate.</p>

<p>Cohabitating Husband Sues for Bigamy and Embezzlement</p>
<p>丨New Husband Holds Important Position in Provincial Government, Vows Not to Break the Law丨</p>
<p>Jia Lin, also known as Huixian, is a young woman of twenty-five. She received higher education, graduated, and became a nurse at a hospital. She and Dr. Lin Guangjian developed a romance from friendship and got married. On the morning of July 24th this year, Jia Huixian suddenly left without a trace. Ten days later, Lin Guangjian received a wedding invitation from his friend Li Zitan, inviting him to a wedding ceremony for Pu Lin and Wu Bin from Anhui, to be held at the World Hotel on Taiping Road in Nanjing. Because Lin's wife was also named Jia Lin, he was unsure if it was the same person, so he forwarded the invitation to Lin and asked him about it. Lin received the letter and learned that his wife</p>

<p>While he was in anger, the farewell letter that Jia Lin sent to Lin from Zhenjiang was also delivered by the postman. The letter stated, "From now on, I am Wu's wife" and asked Lin to return her clothes and ornaments, as well as the gold rings they had exchanged. If he wanted them back, she would return them. Otherwise, she would keep them as a memento. Lin then wrote back, asking her to come to Shanghai in person to return the items. Therefore, Jia Lin and her new husband, Wu Bin, traveled from Zhenjiang to Shanghai and stayed at the Yuanyuan Hotel on Jiujiang Road. On the morning of the 13th, they went to Lin Guangjian's clinic at No. 304 Jiangxi Road to negotiate the return of the items. Lin immediately called</p>
<h3 id="e165">Lawyer Wu Peng <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>for instructions on how to respond. Lawyer Wu told him that his runaway wife had come with her lover and should be handed over to the police for investigation. Upon arriving at the Central Police Station, the police chief asked about the matter. Because Wu Bin, also known as Chuba,</p>
<p>holds an important position in the First Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, he was not immediately detained. He was ordered to return to the hotel with Jia Lin to await further summons. He also reported and sued Jia Lin and Wu Bin to the First Special District Court for committing bigamy under Article 254 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Court Issued Summonses <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the two defendants were summoned to court. The plaintiff, Lin Zhijian, also attended with his lawyer, Wu Peng. Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division took the seat in the First Court and ordered the two defendants to stand in the defendant's position. After asking their names, ages, and addresses, Attorney Qian Xunjiu, representing the police station, stated the case. He said that at 10:00 AM on the 13th, they came to the police station together. The plaintiff pointed out that the first defendant, Jia Lin, was his wife. They were formally married in Jieyang County, his hometown, on August 24th of last year, and he presented a marriage contract and marriage certificate. Jia suddenly</p>

<p>on the morning of July 24th without saying goodbye. Two weeks later, the plaintiff received a wedding invitation from a friend and a handwritten letter from Jia Lin, informing him of her remarriage. However, according to Jia Lin's confession at the police station, she only admitted to cohabiting with Lin, stating that she had never seen the marriage certificate. She went to Guangzhou last year with the plaintiff's nephew, and Lin did not go. She denied the fact of marriage. Wu Bin also claimed that he only knew about Jia Lin's cohabitation and was unaware of whether they were married. He remarried and held a formal wedding ceremony with Jia Lin in Nanjing. However, the certificate presented by the plaintiff was complete with introducer, officiant, and others, and was affixed with</p>

<p>which did not appear to be forged. Therefore, he filed a public prosecution. The two defendants are now staying at a hotel. If the case cannot be concluded today, they should be released on bail. Lawyer Wu then submitted a private indictment on behalf of his client, Lin Guangjian. The indictment detailed the course of his relationship with Jia Lin, stating that he met Jia Lin through a friend's introduction in March of last year. With the consent of both families, they entered into a marriage contract. On August 24th of last year, Jia Lin went to Jieyang and married the plaintiff at the plaintiff's home in Ximen Dongya Villa. They exchanged rings and signed the certificate together. They returned to Shanghai and continued to cohabit. Unexpectedly,</p>
<h3 id="e169">Jia Lin Was Fickle <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of July 24th this year, she took the opportunity to run away on the pretext of shopping and married the second defendant, Wu Bin, in Beijing. She also sent a letter asking for her ornaments, stating that she was now Wu's wife. The plaintiff was shocked and never expected her to commit the crimes of bigamy, embezzlement, and adultery. Furthermore, the second defendant knew that Jia Lin was the plaintiff's wife and repeatedly asked Jia to publish a notice in the newspaper to sever relations with the plaintiff. It was clear that before the marriage,</p>
<h3 id="e170">He Knew She Was a Married Woman <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>was destroying a family, and there was no doubt that he had committed the crimes of bigamy under Article 254 and adultery under Article 256 of the Criminal Law. He requested punishment and attached a private indictment, ordering the defendant to pay damages of 20,000 yuan. Lin Guangjian then presented his case and explained the course of his marriage with Jia Lin. He also presented a marriage certificate, exchanged marriage contract, invitation card, and a single photo of Jia Lin dressed in her wedding attire as evidence. When questioned, the defendant Jia Lin stated that she was from Anji County, Zhejiang, and worked as a nurse in Shanghai. Because Lin was a doctor, they became acquainted. The 128 Incident occurred last year, and I could not return home. At this time, I</p>
<h3 id="e171">Began to Cohabit with Lin <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Because Lin promised to hold a wedding in three months, I reluctantly agreed. I later learned that Lin had an affair with a Suzhou woman. Suspecting his character, I exchanged written agreements to ensure trust. However, after three months, Lin did not prepare for the wedding. Whenever I asked him, he would say that he was not financially well-off. Later, I went to Guangzhou with his nephew. The purpose of going was twofold: (1) to attend his nephew's wedding, and (2) to investigate Lin's family situation and whether he had married. The photo he presented was indeed taken in Guangzhou. Because on that day, I returned from watching a play and felt that the local costumes were very different from those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Lin's sister-in-law said that the</p>
<h3 id="e172">Bride on Stage <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>was dressed like a folk martial artist. I still have this costume. Upon hearing this, I went to the inner room to dress up and was persuaded to take this photo. This was just a game, but I never expected him to use it as evidence today. Whether we are married or not can be testified by the doorman Ma Fengting at No. 211 Zesheng Lane, Road Ba Zi can be summoned as a witness. Besides, if I have already married Lin, why are all the people who signed the marriage certificate he presented surnamed Lin, and none of my relatives and friends participated? I am because he</p>
<h3 id="e173">Delayed Performing the Marriage <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>agreement. I deeply knew that my status was not correct and it was difficult to stand in the law. I was extremely heartbroken. I had taken poison twice. This time I left without saying goodbye was due to the fact that I was insulted and scolded by his father in May, and Lin did not say a word, making me even more embarrassed and knowing that I could not be protected by law. The night before I left, I discussed this with Lin, but Lin blamed me more, making me even colder. All the procedures for my marriage with Wu were completely legal marriage, The certificate is now stored at No. 93 Zhongzheng Road, Zhenjiang. As for the letter that Lin presented with my seal, it was forged, and the word "marriage" was added later. This can all</p>

<p>A few days ago, Lin called me and asked me to come to Shanghai to get my clothes. If I had formally married him and now dared to remarry to someone else, I would have gone to his house again. I also know a little about the law and would not want to do this illegal thing." When she reached the sad part of her confession, tears flowed down her face like beads. According to Wu Bin's confession, because my sister and Jia Lin are friends, we became acquainted. Before the marriage, Jia Lin said that she only had a cohabitation relationship with Lin. Therefore, I drafted a notice to be published in the newspaper to sever the relationship. If they were formally married, they could not handle it this way if they divorced. Since they only cohabited, and she said that the procedures had been cleared, and I happened to want to remarry, I married her. I am a current official, how dare I break the law?" Judge Feng then ordered the defendants to post a bond for being summoned at any time and rescheduled the trial for Friday next week. He also sent a detective to escort Jia Lin to Zhenjiang to retrieve the marriage certificate, pending verification.</p>

<p>The two men claimed to be military police; the youth was said to be a political prisoner</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 2:30 PM, at the intersection of Rue Corneille and Avenue Haig in western Shanghai, in front of the Dajia Kuifeng Department Store, a youth of about twenty years of age was walking along. As he stopped for a moment, preparing to head east, two men suddenly appeared from behind, one in a blue cotton short shirt and the other in a black cotton short shirt. They leaped forward, drew out handguns, and abruptly shot at the youth. With a loud bang, the youth fell to the ground, struck in the leg, bleeding profusely. Fortunately, the nearby patrol officer and Song Ziming, the police chief of the Sixth District Singapore Road Police Station, heard the shots and rushed to the scene. They apprehended the two men, seized two six-round revolvers and nine bullets, and took them along with the injured man back to the Sixth District. The injured youth (who identified himself as Li Ning) was first sent by car to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The bullet had not yet exited, and his life may be out of danger. After questioning by the district chief, the two men, one identified as Qiao Chuntao and the other as Li Rong, both claimed to be sergeants in the First Battalion of the Military Police Headquarters. They stated that the injured man was a political prisoner, and they were arresting him there. Because he tried to escape, they opened fire. However, the two men were wearing plainclothes and had no insignia, which seemed suspicious. A decision was made to prepare a written report and transfer them to the General Bureau for further questioning.</p>

<p>Nine thieves captured in total; handguns and bullets seized for investigation</p>
<p>Qi Zhongshu, a local resident of Xiajia Garden on Route Gustaves de Bezenval in the Caoxi Road area of western Shanghai, is 33 years old. He is married to Xia, and they have a daughter named Wenjuan, who is ten years old and attends the Western District Elementary School of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Qi has been working as a cashier at the Southeast Trust Company at 34 Avenue Edward VII for many years. He is usually frugal and lives comfortably, so he has some savings. Qi's mother-in-law, Xia Su, is 54 years old and also lives in the house. For self-defense, Qi has a handgun (number 93128) and always carries it with him for protection. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 PM the previous night, three bandits armed with weapons scaled the bamboo fence of Qi's house and burst into the inner room, heading straight for Qi's bedroom. Qi had already fallen asleep and was startled awake. The thieves approached Qi, showed their handguns, and threatened him to keep him under surveillance. One thief took a jade and gold ring from Qi's hand and a rectangular platinum watch from Qi's wife. Qi's daughter saw the thieves' fierce faces and began to cry loudly. Qi's mother-in-law heard the noise and entered the room, but she was immediately restrained by two thieves and told to keep quiet. Qi seized the opportunity to quickly grab his handgun from under the pillow and fired two shots at the thieves, but missed. Hearing the shots and realizing the situation was dire, the thieves fled, taking their loot with them. The victim shouted for help to catch the thieves. Coincidentally, officers from the Sixth District Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were passing by and heard the gunshots. They followed the sound to investigate and learned what had happened. They helped to surround and capture the bandits, chasing them to Avenue du Maréchal Joffre, where they apprehended Zhao Afeng and Yang Jinsheng, both from Jiading. Under interrogation, Zhao and the others confessed to the robbery and revealed the addresses of their accomplices. Lu Ying, the head of the Detective Team, ordered Tang Bingxiang, the leader of the Sixth District detectives, along with detectives Cao Chuqiao, Yang Zhongjin, and Zhou Wenhai, to take the criminals to 1 Zhongshan Village at 9 AM yesterday morning and arrest Shen Boqing and Tang Zicheng. They then went to 9 Yongan Lane on Avenue Gustaves de Bezenval and found a six-round revolver and four bullets. In the nearby Xin Shen textile factory dormitory, they captured bandits Lin Jinsheng, Tao Afu, Cai Zicheng, Guo Hancheng, and two suspects, for a total of nine thieves. The guns and bullets were interrogated by District Chief Tan Baoshou and then, yesterday afternoon, a written report was prepared and sent to the General Bureau for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Postal Workers' Union Held Emergency Executive and Supervisory Meeting <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Expressing concern over the serious postal strike in Hankou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, regarding the postal authorities' denial of the Hankou Postal Workers' Union as a major serious incident in the history of the postal workers' union, convened an emergency joint meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members yesterday afternoon to discuss active assistance measures. All executive and supervisory committee members attended. After Chairman Fan Caicong reported the purpose of the meeting, Zhu Xuefan, a standing committee member of the National Postal Workers' General Union, attended and reported on the detailed process of the Hankou postal strike. The following measures were unanimously decided on the spot: (1) Send a telegram to Hankou promising to provide assistance with strength, (2) Expand publicity, (3) Issue a statement to all sectors of society, (4) Set a deadline for a final warning to the authorities, (5) Post slogans throughout the various postal service bureaus, (6) Secretly. The union issued the following statement to all sectors of society: Public Notice to All Sectors of Society Nationwide, The organization of our postal workers' union, although it originated in Shanghai, was subsequently established in Tianjin, Beiping, Nanjing, Jinan, Kaifeng, Changsha, and other major commercial ports. The initial purpose of its organization was to support the revolution and serve the country as its greatest goal. For the past ten years, our postal workers' unions in various regions have been committed to consistent efforts. Whether towards the country or towards society, although we dare not boast of our achievements, the facts speak for themselves and have been recognized by all sectors of society. Furthermore, our postal workers' union has never failed the country or society. Moreover, now that the country is facing numerous difficulties, our postal workers nationwide are upholding their patriotic zeal in the hope of being able to serve the people. Unexpectedly, at this time, an incident occurred in which the postal authorities denied the Hankou Postal Workers' Union. The Hankou Postal Workers' Union, at the beginning of its establishment, received instructions from the Hankou Special City Party Department. In addition to being approved for filing, it was also forwarded to the Central Party Department for filing. Thus, the Hankou Postal Workers' Union already has a legal basis for its establishment, which is no different from that relied upon by the postal workers' unions in other regions as legitimate organizations. However, the postal authorities actually refused to recognize the Hankou Postal Workers' Union, calling it an illegal organization. Since this incident occurred, our union has regarded it as a major serious event in the history of the postal workers' union. The postal workers' unions that have been established in various regions, numbering no fewer than sixty, have all been formally recognized by the postal authorities, and some have even been given financial assistance. Why is it that this time the Hankou Postal Workers' Union is being uniquely denied, being called illegitimate? The postal workers' unions throughout the country are all the same, so what is the point of the postal authorities' subsidies and recognition? Our union has pondered this repeatedly, and upon further investigation, we have suddenly realized that the postal authorities have other sinister motives. Their sole aim is to destroy the organization of our entire postal workers' union. Therefore, they are first launching an attack in Hankou, which is also a continuation of actions carried out throughout the country. Nothing could be more serious than this. I still remember when the postal protection movement occurred in the past, those treacherous villains hired a group of lackeys in an attempt to seize our postal workers' union, but they failed. Now they are changing their strategy and attacking from another direction in order to achieve their ultimate goal. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel outraged. Therefore, I am exposing their conspiracy to inform all sectors of society. As for our union, on the one hand, we see the postal service in danger, and on the other hand, we are personally affected by the situation. Where there is justice, we dare not fail to fight. We hope that all sectors of society will understand and instruct us. We would be most grateful.</p>

<p>| Will perform Peking Opera at the Tianchan Stage |</p>
<p>Shanghai gentry and businessmen, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Du Yuesheng, are scheduled to perform Peking Opera at the Tianchan Stage on the west end of Simalu next week to raise funds for the Yellow River flood disaster. In addition to inviting famous amateur performers and well-known guest performers from Shanghai to participate and contribute their talents, they have also requested Miss Rosa Jung, a German lady living in Beiping, to appear on stage. In the past, there was the Englishman Li Jiabai who could sing Peking Opera, which was then praised as a beautiful story in the opera world. However, Mr. Li was a male guest performer who was good at singing old male roles, while Miss Yong Zhujun is a Western lady from a prominent family who excels in singing Qingyi and Huadan roles, which is even more commendable. Now, she is only willing to occasionally sacrifice her beauty for the sake of pleading for the Yellow River flood victims. This is a rare opportunity and a grand event unprecedented in Shanghai. Those who are fond of Zhou Yu will definitely rush to feast their eyes and ears. Miss Yong is 23 years old and the daughter of a wealthy German merchant living in China. She grew up in Beiping and received Chinese higher education. She speaks pure Beiping language. Because of her love of music, she has always had a research into Chinese silk and bamboo instruments. She has been learning Peking Opera for only two years, and her rehearsals in Beiping have been praised by Peking Opera critics. She recently came to Shanghai and participated in a private performance at the invitation of Mr. Yuan Ludeng, which has won the enthusiastic admiration of the audience. It is said that she has planned the following programs for the flood relief donation: the first day (19th) is the full version of "Si Lang Visits His Mother", the second day (20th) is "Yu Tang Chun", and the third day (21st) is the full version of "Cutting Hair to Replace Head".</p>
<h3 id="e180">Prelude to the Opening of the Family Industrial Cooperative on September 18th <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Before the "Invincible" Tooth Powder was launched, the national market was dominated by Japanese goods. Customs investigations showed that imports were over 4 million yuan per year. Tianxu Wosheng, a well-known figure in the press, aspired to the great cause of industry. Together with his son, Mr. Chen Xiaodie, he founded the Family Industrial Cooperative to manufacture "Invincible" Tooth Powder. The initial capital was only 10,000 yuan. At the time of the National Humiliation of May 9th, they worked hard to strengthen the country, and spared no effort in promoting domestic products. In less than three years, the Diamond Lion brand disappeared from the national market. Tianxu Wosheng felt that this was not enough, and went on to manufacture various cosmetics, as well as liquor and stationery. All raw materials that could be manufactured domestically were manufactured in their own factories. The total capital has reached nearly one million yuan, and the number of workers is in the thousands. However, there is no large-scale distribution center. All those who love "Invincible" domestic products have been looking forward to it. Now, the cooperative is using the spirit of "Invincible" to organize a new scientific management method, dividing the factory and distribution center into two major divisions. The factory is headed by Director Li Xinfu, and the sales are headed by Director Chen Xiaodie. The "Invincible" distribution center is located at the mouth of the ball field on Nanjing Road. All the decorations are designed by Chen Xiaodie, and it took four months to build. It has created a world of glass. Being in it is like being in a mirror palace, crystal clear and dazzling. The construction cost reached 30,000 yuan. On September 18th at 2:00 PM, the opening ceremony will be held simultaneously with the four major distribution centers of the China Asia-Pacific Electrical Appliance Factory, the Zhanghua Woolen Textile Factory, and the China Ceramics Company. The business will officially start on September 19th, selling September 18th commemorative goods. Each set, originally priced as high as two or three yuan, will be sold for 9.18 yuan to commemorate the national humiliation with a spirit of struggle, not a gesture of decline and sorrow.</p>

<p>Re-scheduled for trial in seven days</p>
<p>Yin Bohong, from Shandong, and Dong Shujin, from Anhui, who lived at 21 Rue Conty, recently privately established the Fifth Route Headquarters of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in room 39 of the Huadong Apartments on Avenue du Roi Albert, issuing appointment letters indiscriminately and defrauding people of money for their own use. This was discovered by Pu Xuli, the director of the Investigation Section of the Political Department of the French Concession Police, who led detectives Zhao Zibo and others to Huadong Apartments on the morning of the 9th of this month, and arrested Yin and Dong, as well as fake staff officers Zhou Bingrong, Cui Jie, and Sheng Ganchen, and five other people. They then went to 22 Baoxingli and arrested Lu Hanwen and Wang Peide, and seized appointment letters, military officer rosters, armed belts, military uniforms, official documents, letters, and other evidence in the two places and in Dong Shujin's home. The Second Special District Court interrogated and detained them for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Xiong Huiping continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Because the police investigation was not yet completed, the police lawyer requested a seven-day extension. The court approved the rescheduling of the trial to the morning of the 20th, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

Those that have not established saltpeter and sulfur bureaus, such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Gansu, Suiyuan, Rehe, Chahar, and Xinjiang, should submit applications for passports and transport documents to the highest salt affairs agency in their respective provinces for verification and issuance. The saltpeter and sulfur affairs of Guizhou are temporarily handled by the Sichuan Transport Commissioner, and the saltpeter and sulfur affairs of Sichuan are handled by the Sichuan Transport Commissioner and the North Sichuan Transport Deputy Commissioner, according to the salt distribution area. Shaanxi is temporarily handled by the Hedong Transport Commissioner, Shanxi is temporarily handled by the North Jin Revenue and Transport Bureau, and Chahar is temporarily handled by the North Mongolian Salt Bureau.

<h3 id="e189">Cruel Mother-in-Law Abuses Daughter-in-Law; Neighbors Outraged <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Representatives were elected to go to the police station to request an investigation</p>
<p>Wang Ni, a Ningbo woman, is 43 years old. Because her husband died many years ago, she was unaccustomed to being alone and became acquainted with Zhong Xiaoxiang, a fellow villager, and lived with him at 63 Risheng Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. Wang Ni had a son from her previous marriage, named Zhixi, who is 23 years old and works as a worker in a foundry. He also lives with his mother and Zhong. In the first month of last year, Wang Ni, through a matchmaker, hired Lu Jinhui, the daughter of Lu Xiaohu, as her daughter-in-law (now 18 years old). After she married into the family, the relationship between the couple was not very harmonious, and Wang Ni was inherently mean, with her neighbors calling her a shrew. When treating Jinhui, she was initially kind, but when Jinhui slightly offended her, she was whipped. Zhixi, her son, and Zhong Xiaoxiang, her lover, also listened to Wang Ni and helped her to abuse Jinhui. As a result, Jinhui was covered in wounds and suffered greatly. Yesterday morning, after Wang Ni got up, Jinhui got a basin of water and asked her mother-in-law to wash her face. However, because her voice was slightly low, Wang Ni did not hear her. When Wang Ni caught sight of the washbasin on the table, she accused Jinhui of not greeting her and immediately slapped the woman twice on the cheek. Jinhui knew that Wang Ni's bad temper was raging and there was no reasoning with her, so she could only secretly shed tears and sob quietly. Wang Ni was still not satisfied and used the leather shoes that her lover was wearing to beat Jinhui all over her body. Where the shoes hit, the skin broke and bled. However, Jinhui did not dare to cry out or resist. It was not until Wang Ni was exhausted that she stopped and said sternly to Jinhui, "Be careful tonight." In the evening, after Zhong Xiaoxiang and Wang Zhixi returned home for dinner, Jinhui took off her coat and was about to go to bed when Wang Ni and Zhixi unexpectedly entered the room. They first stuffed cotton into Jinhui's mouth to prevent her from making a sound, then grabbed her hands and feet and beat her severely. In this bad environment, Jinhui had no choice but to moan. However, this faint sound reached outside and was heard by Rong Weng, who lived in the same residence. Knowing that Wang Ni was displaying her power again, he tiptoed to the door of Jinhui's bedroom. Seeing that the door was tightly closed, he peeked through the crack and saw this tragic scene. He was furious and immediately returned to his room, opened the window, and loudly gathered the neighbors. They kindly advised Wang Ni and the others not to abuse their daughter-in-law like this. Unexpectedly, Wang Ni and the others cursed at the neighbors. The neighbors could not bear it any longer and discussed it that night. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Fang Aiqing, Sha Heshang, Chen Jinzhi, Xu Hongfu, Li Aqing, Xue Asan, Liu Fusheng, Zhang Quanyou, Zou Xiaoxing, and a dozen other residents of the neighborhood represented all the residents and went to the first police station in the district to report the situation and request an investigation. Chief Yi immediately sent the police to the neighborhood and arrested Wang Ni. However, her son Wang Zhixi and the others were not at home, so they were not arrested. Wang Ni, along with her daughter-in-law Jinhui, were taken back to the station. After a preliminary hearing, it was found that Jinhui was indeed covered in wounds and blood stains. It was deemed that Wang Ni's abuse of her daughter-in-law was inhumane. Wang Ni was temporarily detained and the police were ordered to arrest Wang Zhixi and the others and send them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Yu Mingzhang, from Chongming, lives in Chongzheng Bridge in Suzhou City. He has a daughter named Yu Xiulin, who is nine years old this year. Yu Xiulin is lovely and cute. Because Yu Mingzhang works as a cook outside, and his wife does needlework, their daughter is left unattended at home. The kidnapper Yuan Shiquan, who is from the same village, used picture cards and food as bait to lure her out. They then took a car to Shanghai and hid her in the Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei, waiting for a price. After Yu Mingzhang lost his daughter, he sent out scouts to search for her, but there was no news. However, his cousin Sun Buting works at the Xiaoshadu Construction Factory in Shanghai, so he immediately sent a letter to instruct him to pay attention to the search. It was not until the day before yesterday that Sun found out and reported to Yu Mingzhang, who came to Shanghai to look for her. He found her there and immediately called the police to arrest Yuan Shiquan and send him to the Fifth District Second Precinct, who transferred him to the District Court for trial.</p>

Suddenly losing his leadership, everyone deeply regrets it. All parties were communicating and meeting when they saw the Ministry of Education's directive to retain him, which initially resolved the situation. However, all measures rely on Chen's return to Zhejiang to personally preside over and promote them. All the presidents of provincial specialized normal schools, vocational schools, senior, junior, and complete middle schools, as well as the directors of various social education institutions, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Education yesterday, urging Chen to return to Hangzhou as soon as possible, and also telegraphed Chen himself, urging him.</p>

<p>(Yangzhou News) Private Yangzhou Middle School in this county has been established for many years. Since Zhang Henian became the headmaster, it has been further reformed. All books, instruments, and sports equipment have been added as much as possible. The teachers hired are mostly well-known figures in the education field. The number of students has now reached more than 300, and students from far away, such as those from Jianfu, are still coming in an endless stream. It is also learned that the school will now improve the efficiency of the senior three courses in order to achieve excellent results in next year's joint examination. It is also heard that the chief school director, Wang Zhongwei (Bailing), believes that today's youth must have military knowledge in order to defend against insults. Therefore, he personally goes to the school every morning to teach military subjects in order to train the entire faculty and students into a whole army.</p>

<p>More than 250 New and Returning Students</p>
<p>The National Shanghai School of Commerce's affiliated preparatory course will open this year with four departments: Banking, Accounting, Business Administration, and Journalism. Under the active reorganization of Dean Fei Fuheng and Preparatory Course Director Yuan Zijian, and the hiring of experienced scholars to take on educational affairs, everything has been refreshed. The preparatory course has also been moved to the New China Academy on Route Saussure, which is more convenient than the former Avenue Joffre location, and the classrooms are also more spacious. More than 150 new students have registered for the semester, bringing the total number of new and returning students to about 250, which is a great development. However, the establishment of the preparatory course was originally intended to help young people who have dropped out of school and provide extracurricular tutoring, so the number is not limited. Enrollment is still ongoing. Anyone with a middle school diploma can be admitted without examination. The preparatory course is scheduled to officially start classes on the 20th of this month. Any young people who are eager to learn can go to the School of Commerce at 1698 Avenue Joffre to register.</p>

<p>Zhaohe Middle School, which was established to commemorate the Zhaohe warship uprising in 1915, held a supplementary opening ceremony at 10 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>People in attendance: Chairman of the Board Wu Tiecheng, Mayor; Vice Chairman Yang Hu, Chief of the Security Office; Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau; Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau; Lin Meiyan of the Municipal Party Department; Lu Jie of the Security Office Special Party Department; Chen Hou of the Two-Road Party Department; Hou Dachun of the Security Office; and representatives from various schools and institutions, Tan Baoshou, Chen Qun, etc., as well as 300 faculty and students from the entire school.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the meeting and salute, Chairman and Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating that the significance of Zhaohe Middle School's establishment lies in commemorating the revolutionary achievements of the Zhaohe warship in Shanghai, and at the same time, it is necessary to instill the fearless spirit of the Zhaohe warship's revolution and the martyrs into the general youth of China. The current China is very dangerous, but the future China is bright. To build the ideal country planned by our Premier, the current youth must continue the spirit of the Zhaohe martyrs and fully prepare themselves to be worthy of the heavy responsibility of building the country. Next, Principal Jia Bo reported on the opening process, the main points of which were: (1) The motivation for initiating Zhaohe Middle School and the preparation process. (2) Thanking the directors and Director Pan of the Education Bureau for their support. (3) The future plan is broad and far-reaching, and we hope that all sectors will continue to guide and support us to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: Next, Director Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, stating that Zhaohe Middle School is different from ordinary middle schools, so the Minister of Education specially approved its establishment. Secondary education is the most important stage for young people, and it is important to be serious in running it. Reading the school's founding declaration shows its various aspects, which are admirable, and the emphasis on cultivating a good academic atmosphere is even more evident in the school's knowledge of education. Then, Lin Meiyan, a member of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, stating that the school is a place to practice being a person. China's education has been running for more than 40 years, but it has failed because it is consumptive. In the future, we hope for moral education, and first of all, we must cultivate a good academic atmosphere, and let your school be the first. Finally, School Director Wu Xingya gave a speech, explaining the true meaning of the school motto (bravery and honesty), stating that the four words "bravery and honesty" are the true spirit of the Zhaohe Uprising and the key to our national revival and national construction.</p>
<p>Yang Hu's Reply: Finally, Chairman Yang Hu gave a reply, first thanking the guests for their presence and apologizing for the lack of hospitality. Then, he extended and elaborated on the two words "bravery and honesty," moving those who heard it. The ceremony ended around 12 o'clock. Photos were taken and the attendees dispersed. To celebrate, the school authorities took a half-day holiday in the afternoon, and in the evening, Lianhua Film Company Zheng Yongzhi donated a film for everyone to enjoy together.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Most Perfect Low-Frequency Amplification <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The low-frequency amplification commonly used in radios today can be roughly divided into three types:</p>
<p>(1) Resistance-Coupled Amplification: This type of amplification occupies a small space, is low in cost, and also because it uses non-inductive resistors, its value remains constant at any frequency, so the sound quality obtained is the clearest. However, it itself has no amplification effect. If you want to get a large volume, you must increase the number of amplification stages, which is its disadvantage.</p>
<p>(2) Transformer-Coupled Amplification: Transformer-coupled amplification is now the most widely used low-frequency amplification. It can obtain a very large amplification factor with a small amount of power. However, the magnetic inductance of the low-frequency transformer is inversely proportional to the direct current passing through it. If the current is large, the magnetic inductance will be reduced. If the current exceeds the specified value, the transformer core will be saturated, which will have a great impact on the sound quality.</p>
<p>(3) Push-Pull Amplification: To obtain a large and undistorted sound, push-pull amplification must be used. However, push-pull amplification consumes a lot of power, and it is not often used in small-scale radios.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a type called choke coil amplification, which is similar in form and function to resistance amplification. Very few radios use this type of amplification method now, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Low-frequency amplification occupies a very important position in the radio. Carelessness in design can affect the efficiency of the entire machine. Therefore, it is necessary to be extra cautious before installation.</p>
<p>The low-frequency amplification introduced in this article is designed using the principle of filtering. It combines resistance coupling and transformer coupling (originally named Resistance-fed Transformer Coupling), so that it grasps the advantages of both sides, while minimizing the disadvantages of both sides.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, R is a 500,000 ohm resistor, C is a ol mtd capacitor, and T is a commonly used low-frequency transformer. (B + is changed to B -) When used, the plate direct current only passes through R. The primary coil of the transformer only passes through the fluctuating low-frequency current. Since there is no direct current passing through the transformer, its magnetic inductance can remain unchanged, and the danger of saturation can also be avoided. Therefore, the sound wave obtained is not only very clear, but also larger in volume than that of using transformer coupling alone.</p>
<p>We know that the primary coil of the transformer is most easily burned out, but if the above method is adopted, then there is no direct current passing through the coil, so this kind of loss can of course be reduced. It is also necessary to mention this feature incidentally.</p>

<p>Below: Steps to Adjust a Feedback Oscillator Transmitter</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the frequency, large-power, long-distance communication stations often use feedback oscillator transmitters. For example, the current international radio stations in Shanghai, such as Fenglin Bridge, all use this type.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a feedback oscillator transmitter uses a small vacuum tube to generate oscillation, and then amplifies it through several stages before sending it to the antenna. Therefore, the feedback oscillator first avoids changes in the plate capacitance due to the high heat of the vacuum tube plate power, and second, it avoids the influence of the antenna part directly coupled to the oscillation circuit. However, in today's most popular feedback oscillator, the oscillation is not generated by the method of returning the plate current to the grid, but by using a crystal to generate a qualitative oscillation, as shown in Figure 4. When the frequency of LC itself resonates with the crystal quartz, there will be a considerable amount of electricity to the grid circuit, causing the quartz to oscillate. Once the quartz oscillates, even if the frequency of LC changes, it will not affect the oscillation frequency of the quartz. The magnitude of its frequency is purely determined by its thickness. The shorter and thinner it is, the higher its frequency will be. However, it is very difficult to find a method with appropriate thickness for ordinary shortwave applications. Therefore, there is an application for a frequency multiplier. For example, if we want to transmit 20 meters, if the oscillation frequency of the quartz is 1875 kHz (160 meters), then after the first frequency multiplier, it becomes 3750 kHz (80 meters), and after the second to third, it becomes 15000 kHz (20 meters). Therefore, the structure of today's new transmitters mostly has the following procedure:</p>
<p>In the figure, the first stage is a quartz-controlled oscillator with a frequency of F. The second stage is called a buffer amplifier, which further expands the original F to make it more stable. Then the third, fourth, and fifth stages are all frequency multipliers, which multiply the frequency to 8F. The sixth and seventh stages are to forcefully amplify the 8F after the fifth multiplication (Power Ampl) ify) and send it to the antenna for outward transmission. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e240">What's Inside a Vacuum Tube? Zijing <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The term "vacuum tube" is already very common. As the name suggests, we know that a vacuum tube is a glass tube with nothing inside. But vacuum tubes are not really vacuum. The facts tell us that there are indeed many things inside this tube that we cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Suppose there is now a round glass ball with a diameter of 5 o'clock, and the air inside has been pumped out to a considerable degree by a vacuum pump. In other words, it can be said to be a vacuum. However, there are still the following things inside this glass tube:</p>
<p>(1) Nitrogen molecules: 288,300,000,000,000</p>
<p>(2) Gas molecules: 77,600,000,000,000</p>
<p>(3) molecules: 3,450,000,000,000</p>
<p>(4) Carbon dioxide molecules: 644,000,000,000</p>
<p>(5) Radon molecules: 4,470,000,000</p>
<p>(6) molecules: 25,000,000</p>
<p>(7) molecules: 5,000,000</p>
<p>Moreover, although there are 369,998,495,000,000 molecules moving around in this tube, it does not feel crowded. As for the air pressure inside the ball, it is only one millionth of the atmospheric pressure. If the air pressure inside the ball is equal to the atmospheric pressure, then there will be 28,988,423,520,000,000,000 molecules present. Therefore, until now, there is no absolute vacuum tube in this world.</p>

<p>(5) Manufacturing Moisture-Proof Wood: Wood has a small density and easily absorbs moisture. If you are making the outer casing of a radio, it is often the case that the radio reception is poor due to the air being too humid. It is best to first apply the following chemicals evenly to the wood panel: Method A: Saturated solution of zinc chloride,</p>
<p>Method B: Six parts boric acid, five parts ammonium chloride, three parts borax, add 100 parts water,</p>
<p>Choose either of the above two methods. After it is completely dry, apply paint to prevent moisture absorption.</p>
<p>(6) Polishing Discarded Records: Cut the discarded record (i.e. phonograph record), first use coarse sand to smooth out the fine lines, then use fine sandpaper to rub it, and then use a cloth dipped in sesame oil to rub it in one direction until it is polished. Hard rubber or plastic boards can also be polished in this way, but avoid the step of removing the lines with coarse sandpaper.</p>
<p>(7) Lubricant: Soap applied to the saw blade can prevent it from being astringent when sawing wood. Applied to screws, it is easy to screw into the wood and also easy to disassemble. (8) Cleaning Files: When filing hardware or wood plastic boards with a file, the filings will gather on the file teeth. Because of this reason, the file is easily dulled. It is best to apply chalk powder to the file teeth before use. After use, immerse it in a dilute acidic liquid for half an hour (if the debris gathered on the teeth is wood or plastic board debris, use dilute sulfuric acid; if it is hardware debris, use dilute hydrochloric acid). After taking it out, rinse it with clean water once, then wash it with salt water many times. After drying, rub it with an oiled cloth. This not only does not damage the file teeth, but also makes it faster and faster. (End)</p>

<p>Simple Method for Connecting Wires - Steelyard</p>
<p>Inside a radio, the circuit is crisscrossed, and the number of wires accounts for almost two-thirds of the entire machine, and their function is also extremely important. Once it is broken even a little bit, the radio reception will be cut off immediately. Therefore, the method of connecting wires is extremely important. Coarser wires can be soldered, but the wires inside the speaker, headphones, and transformers are often above number 40, then the procedure is difficult to implement. With the following method, as long as your hands are quick and your eyes are sharp, the work will be very reliable. First, disassemble the original parts that have been inspected and are considered to have broken wires, find the broken ends, and prepare for work. Put the two ends of the break at the same time in the lower outer flame of the flame (the type of flame is related to the number of the wire, see below). Wait for them to melt into small balls, immediately make the two ends contact in the flame, and they will be connected in one place, and immediately take them out of the flame.</p>
<p>After the joint has cooled, apply paint or resin to the exposed copper to prevent current leakage, and then it can be used. The flame used is a gas stove for number 28 to number 30, an alcohol lamp for number 30 to number 40, and a candle flame for numbers above 40.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with this method, you can make the interface as thick as a solder, and the conductivity is also very good.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Investigation <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>Missionaries from Western countries are not afraid of the barbarity and uncivilized nature of savage peoples. They cross oceans and come to China, and then distribute themselves to the interior of China to conduct systematic investigations, clearly and thoroughly investigating the transportation, situation, production, customs, education, and military preparations of all provinces, towns, and cities in China. Many places are not as familiar to Chinese people as they are to foreign missionaries. Take the map of China as an example. It is still necessary to go to bookstores in Britain, the United States, or Japan to buy a (China Map) to recognize the edition, which may be more reliable than the (actual survey) by the Chinese themselves. It is shameful to say that this is only a small aspect. To (talk about it), it is really (unspeakable).</p>
<p>However, when Chinese people go abroad, it is very different. What they hear and see and report to our people is either how prosperous the clothing and food life in New York is, or how mysterious the glass dance halls in Paris are. Or how gentle the Japanese geisha are, and how lewd the French prostitutes are.</p>
<p>Some time ago, the Japanese organized (Manchuria and Mongolia Inspection Groups) and (Manchuria and Mongolia Investigation Teams) to engage in investigation work in the eastern and western provinces. Many reports have already been seen in this process. Details are not spared about mountains, rivers, forests, minerals, agricultural products, animal husbandry, customs, household registration, geology, economy, education, and climate. However, what we used to read in the travel notes of Chinese travelers was only that a certain kind of strange fish was produced in a certain place in the Northeast, and the taste was quite delicious; a certain kind of exotic bird was produced in a certain place, which could be used for making ornaments. In some places, the marriage customs were prevalent with polygamy; in some places, both men and women liked to have wild sex. In some places, wives were exchanged for cattle and sheep; in some places, they could even spend the night in the homes of strangers and have sex with their wives and daughters.</p>
<p>However, Chinese travelers who investigate these strange customs are still considered to have some significance. In the metropolis, there are countless foreign talents and well-dressed high-ranking Chinese people who specialize in investigating which school beauty, which queen, opened a warehouse somewhere last night, which concubine, which star, has a relationship with someone in this process, which is really meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="e246">A Farmer's Words <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, there was a farmer in his old age. He brewed a pot of tea under the Fahua Pagoda in the early morning. He said to himself, "This time a (flower collector) has come, it's really terrible!" (In the local dialect of Jiading, a hurricane is called a flower collector, because the cotton is blown off by the wind, so it has this name.) After saying that, he sighed a few times, full of resentment. After a while, he continued loudly, "We farmers always rely on the sky for food. Unfortunately, God is not willing to take care of us. Even if we put in capital and work hard, alas! As long as there is a strong wind and heavy rain, then the snow-white cotton field, every flower is copper money (according to the farmer's tone), will turn into nothing. On weekdays, we look forward to catching two full loads of good flowers. (Picking flowers in the field is called catching flowers.) Who knows that it is just empty happiness. Alas! It is directly said that heaven raises people, but heaven is not willing to raise people, and people cannot ask heaven for help." After saying that, he continued to sob!</p>
<p>When I heard this, I couldn't help but feel moved. I asked him, "Which village do you come from?" He said, "I come from Dongxiang. How is the wind disaster in Dongxiang this time?" "Alas! Don't mention it. This year's cotton, at first glance, seemed to be a year of great harvest. Unexpectedly, it was blown by the wind for a day and a night, and then by a burst of heavy rain, which caused the cotton boll on the stalk to fall off. (The two words Ludo are from a foreign language, that is, Hualing, which is still used in our city.) Originally, each plant had at least a dozen or more, up to thirty or more, which can be said to be unseen in thirty years. Now, when I look at the field, most of them have fallen on the soil. If it hadn't been for the disaster, they could have been caught in the hand. Even if there are a few left, they are still weak and turn into yellow flowers, and they will not be able to sell for money in the future. This is a huge loss, more than the disaster in the 20th year of the Republic of China!"</p>
<p>After hearing this, I thought it was worth asking him more clearly, so I asked him, "Which village's cotton is the best this year?" He said, "The best is Dongnan and Erxiang, Beixiang is second, and Xixiang is second again. Dongxiang had already caught sixty or seventy catties by the end of last month. On average, it was always around thirty or forty catties. If the weather is not out of balance, there is hope for a good harvest. Jiading farming has always been (cotton seventy percent, rice thirty percent). Assuming about 600,000 acres are cultivated, and then discounted to 400,000 acres of cotton fields, this time the disaster is estimated to be a lot? Each cotton plant only needs four flower bolls, and one acre can harvest two loads of flowers. If there is no wind and rain this year, not to mention other things (this year's products from the fields are all harvested), some flowers are also eaten firmly. (The farmer's tone, those who eat firmly, means stable.)" I also asked him, "Is the rice not damaged by the cotton like this?" He said, "The rice is still good because it was planted later. It is now (doing belly) (doing belly, that is, when the nutrients in the stem are flourishing), and it has not yet bloomed. If there is a strong wind and heavy rain later, this is (rice is only afraid of the wind), then it is really bad luck!" After hearing this, I felt that the old man was really speaking from experience, so I drank a loud voice, pulled him away, and at the same time, the applause and laughter of the audience were regarded as a farewell.</p>
<p>Five steps, the first thing that was reflected in my eyes was the four large hollow characters (Open-air Stage) written in chalk, and the handwriting was very strong. This was much larger than what I saw in three steps. There were seven or eight people singing and drumming together, and there were also many self-made crowns, robes, and beards, but the actors in the theater were painting colors on their faces, but they were covering themselves with soot.</p>
<p>Six steps, a group of colorful girls are enjoying the cool, waiting for the people who have not returned. No, not all of them, they are sellers of flesh, waiting for their employers. In several places, they are even forcibly implementing their pulling and pushing methods.</p>
<p>Seven steps, when a person who looked like an upper class man got out of the rickshaw, because the rickshaw puller said a sentence, he simply slapped him twice. The copper coins that should have been given were scattered on the ground. The rickshaw puller bent over, holding his face with one hand and picking up the coins with the other.</p>
<p>Eight steps, a group of shabby and dirty children are scrambling for cold rice and leftovers in a worker's rice bucket and vegetable bowl.</p>
<p>Nine steps, just as a beggar came from behind, stretching out his hand and shouting, "Young master, do a good deed."</p>
<p>Ten steps, a young man wearing a tattered military uniform was constantly shaking a diamond ring in his hand in front of people's eyes. Two men, one wearing a long gown and one wearing a short suit, came to his side.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen The guest leaves with shy tenderness and a smile, and the old bad news arrives, bringing sorrow and anxiety.</p>
<p>He kept making the sound of leather shoes all the way to the gate, feeling that he was a bit neurotic. There was only a little acquaintance between them. Could it be said that this was love that came at the sound of his approach? Men talk about love, always like this. Thinking like this, he stepped out of the gate with one foot, but he heard a very unnatural subtle cough behind him. Looking back, it turned out to be Guizhi standing at the foot of the wall outside the gate. When he turned back to look at her, she also smiled and lowered her head. Zhao Ziqiang's heart was active, and he expected that she must have been standing here meaningfully, so he stood still and nodded to her. Guizhi looked back at the gate, and then took a step closer, and asked Zhao Ziqiang in a low voice: "Did you tell the old man about what happened in the milk tea shop just now?" Zhao Ziqiang paused and smiled: "No, I didn't tell him about it." Guizhi said: "Did you really not say it?" Zhao Ziqiang said sternly: "We still have things to say in the future. If we say it now, it would be bad, wouldn't it?" Guizhi blushed and said: "I didn't mean it that way. Because my family is still very old-fashioned, if it were like Miss Huang, my family would not agree." Zhao Ziqiang had nothing to say, and nodded repeatedly, saying "yes" several times. Guizhi smiled and said: "I have nothing to say, please go." Zhao Ziqiang saw that she did not avoid entering the gate, but asked herself to leave, so of course she did not want to turn her back to people. This feeling was deepened. The smile in his heart was inexplicably surging up on his face, and he also whispered: "Tomorrow, tomorrow, still at that milk tea shop, do you think it's okay?" Guizhi pondered for a while before smiling and asking: "Do you have anything to say?" Zhao Ziqiang stood and thought for a while before smiling and saying: "I don't have anything to say, but I want to follow Xiaotian's words and come back to Haidian every time. It would be best if we could talk and exchange opinions at the milk tea shop." Guizhi didn't say anything, just smiled at him. (188)</p>

<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>These are the ten different impressions I got from the first step to the tenth step after leaving the entrance of XX Lane.</p>
<p>One step, a group of people were surrounding a very small wooden table. There were two pieces of red and black glued to the two ends of the table. A young man sitting in the center was only using his left hand to move a circular bamboo tool in his palm. When the person showed the bamboo tool, the people who were helping out followed and shouted for a while. Then, there was the tinkling sound of silver coins. However, this was just an approximation. The one who watched the most carefully was a woman standing in front of the table. She kept digging in her pocket, and the beads of sweat on her forehead had no more room to hang on. The clear and round sweat that was squeezed down from time to time was like broken pearls.</p>
<p>Two steps, a young man in student attire, but already very dirty, was squatting on the cement and constantly writing, writing. There were already quite a few people watching, and there were three or five copper coins scattered sparsely on the cement. Three steps, a hunchbacked middle-aged man was playing the erhu, and a little girl of twelve or thirteen was standing beside him singing. Four steps, the patrol was next to a passerby, confiscating an opium pipe. They stood talking for a while. Suddenly, they stopped an old man who looked like a countryman and a young man in military uniform and bargained. At the same time, a middle-aged man came from the left and raised the folded photo in his hand and asked in a low voice: (Do you want erotic pictures?)</p>
<p>Confucius once said: (Within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass.) This kind of luck is of course enviable. However, if Confucius were to live in modern times, he would definitely not dare to say such definite words again. Especially in Shanghai, the fragrant grass within ten steps has long become Guangling San.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Financial Beauty Again Proposes Cash Inflation Plan, Standard Gold Falls Below 800 Yuan Mark <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Supply Exceeds Demand, Results in Continuous Fall of 18.2 Yuan, Spot Delivery Premium of 8.4 to 8.9 Yuan</p>
<p>After the gold market failed to hold up and declined in the previous market, yesterday's foreign telegraph reported that the Bank of England rose slightly, the Bank of America continued to rise, the exchange rates between British and American banks continued to rise by more than 2 and 3 points, the British-French small triangle was 2, and the US-French was as high as 9.25 points. The price of silver on the Five Metals Exchange rose sharply by 1.1 percent, American cotton rose by 20 points, stocks rose by 1.05 yuan, American wheat rose by 125 points, and London raw gold continued to rise by 4 pence. People's confidence was insufficient, and the opening price broke through the 800 yuan mark. Then, it bravely returned to more than 800 yuan with replenishment. The situation after the opening was hovering. Later, Reuters reported that American Senator Farragu and Hudson will announce their cash inflation plan proposed to the President today, including (1) requesting the President to immediately issue 300 million yuan of Treasury bills, (2) increasing the domestic gold price to be equal to the free gold market price in foreign countries, and (3) issuing public bonds to purchase silver, etc., and also said that if the President does not implement it, he will definitely pass it through Congress. People were shocked and the price rose and fell. There was a lot of struggle afterwards. The after-market was initially stable, but it was difficult to exceed the 800 yuan mark. Later, as the supply of American exchange from Xiangmeng and others turned abundant, peers scrambled to cash out spot deliveries, and it fell to 793.1 yuan. The spot premium was not cheap, and replenishment was still abundant. The market closed steadily. The premium price was increased by 280 yuan. Within the spot delivery market this time, the price rose from 8.4 yuan to 8.9 yuan, with buyers paying the premium. Now, let me record the market situation for one day:</p>

As a result, it fell by 0.182 yuan compared with the previous close.</p>
<p>The bid price was 817 yuan because HSBC Bank's American exchange listed price rose by 0.0625 to 29.375 yuan, which was about 0.22 yuan based on the closing price, which was 0.005 yuan weaker than the previous close.

In the early stages, the long side paid a premium of 0.088 yuan. There were not many transactions because there were few peers in the market at this time. Before long, it rose to 0.0995 yuan.

<p>Exchange Rate Remains at Six Cents</p>
<p>In recent days, silver dollar receipts at the bank have been quite strong, but yesterday they were slightly subpar, mainly due to a decrease in goods payments, leading to a slight reduction in various receipts. The exchange rate for silver dollars in the market remains at six cents, without any change. The premium for marked silver is only two or three cents in the market. In early morning trading, exchange tickets turnover was 5.34 million, new transactions over 400,000, noon transactions over 300,000, small clearinghouse transactions over 500,000, and pledged silver transactions over 800,000. Due to the busy movement of marked banknotes, the inflow and outflow of banknotes was also strong, totaling 2.7 to 2.8 million, with 100,000 from customer sources. The amount of new currency removed from circulation was estimated at 500,000. Bank receipt news: Foreign banks received silver for ticket payments worth 1.4 to 1.5 million and silver dollars for over 2.4 million. Various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous payments received were worth 2.4 to 2.5 million in silver and 3.6 to 3.7 million in silver dollars. Silver withdrawn from warehouses was 400,000 in silver and 300,000 in silver dollars.

<h3 id="e253">Jiangnan and Guangdong Coins Sluggish and Weak <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins fell another dollar during the morning and noon sessions, with the morning market at 835 dollars and the noon market at 834 dollars. As a result, it was down 1.5 dollars from the previous day. The trading volume was 6,500 in the morning and 5,000 in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins were also soft due to sluggish sales, with the morning market at 788 dollars and 50 cents and the noon market at 789 dollars. As a result, it was down 50 cents from the previous day. The trading volume was 85,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. Copper coins fell another 500 cash, to 313,000 cash, with a transaction volume of over 29,700 strings, valued at 9,500 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Securities and Government Bonds Hover Without Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange remained in a holding pattern, with no improvement in trading volume. The apathy of all parties was unprecedented. The reason for both sides watching and waiting was that market prices were not moving, but the reason why market prices were not moving was based on the inactivity of watching and waiting. The transaction volume was too low, and mutual constraints made the situation increasingly rigid. The two morning sessions yesterday seemed to be trending firmer, with the opening session slightly better by five cents to fifteen cents, and the second session also better by five cents to ten cents, with trading not too quiet. The two afternoon sessions were exceptionally quiet, with most not even opening due to lack of interest. The remaining market prices also showed mixed ups and downs, only five cents apart. Since there was no talk of price increases or decreases, there was no trend to speak of. Such a quiet and dull situation may not see any major price fluctuations for the time being. The final market price only rose or fell by five cents or ten cents, but the current month for gold short positions was slightly higher by thirty cents. The total transaction volume was 3,171,000 dollars, including 1,000 dollars in spot goods, 1,155,000 in total salt tax futures, 335,000 in demobilization, 180,000 in 19--, 620,000 in 20-roll 20-customs, 510,000 in 96-shares, and the rest ranging from 10,000 to tens of thousands. It is reported that the 96-share bondholder group went to see someone, asking them to convey the bondholders' opinions to the Ministry of Finance, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e254">New York Stock Market Firm <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>A report from Sin丰洋行 states that on the 14th, the New York stock market was initially unstable due to the weakness of public utility stocks, but due to the talk of currency inflation and the government's claim to promote the sale of goods and expand credit, the market became active and rose. The total daily trading volume was 2,900,000 shares. Wheat prices initially rose due to buying activity, but then fell back due to Canada's removal of wheat price limits. The future is still not optimistic, and spot goods are very firm. The talk of currency inflation stimulated the activity of the yarn industry, resulting in more trading in cotton. There was a lot of speculative buying, but due to selling from the South, there was a reaction at the close. Spot trading was not very active. Silver was quite firm due to rumors of currency inflation after returns. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 104.66 Up 1.03</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 51.17 Up 0.49</p>

<p>The yarn market has plummeted, and the situation is increasingly weak. Most people in the market believe that the factories do not have adequate measures for yarn futures, the actual demand is not strong, and raw cotton is loosening. As a result, people's hearts are wavering, new sellers are rushing in, and market sentiment is panicking to the extreme.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Marked Yarn Plunges Two Dollars <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market was still good in the morning, but by the second or third session, market sentiment was very weak, and selling became rampant.</p>
<p>It is said that the factories still have no ability to maintain prices, and each month fell by 1.56 dollars to 2.1 dollars. The afternoon opening was still flat, but the second and third sessions fell again. As a result, each month fell by 1, 2, 3, or 4 dimes. The total daily transaction volume was 50,200 bales. It was found that Chunji sold 1,900 bales, Shenchang 1,000 bales, Huachang 1,250 bales, Yiyu 950 bales, Tonghe 1,000 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, and Changyu 1,000 bales.

<p>Fewer existing yarns went to the manufacturers than yesterday. Statistics show that all the banks bought 350 bales throughout the day, and the prices fell by one yuan. Each bank's purchase amount is as follows:</p>

<p>Datong 5 Guangdong 45 North 25</p>
<p>The cotton market is declining, the climate is good, and the yarn market is breaking down. Although American cotton has risen, gold prices are trending down, so people are discouraged. Once the 40-yuan mark is broken, the general selling is like a tide, so the buyers are difficult to support, and the decline is severe. However, a part of them buy fiercely, but it is still difficult to stop the buying trend. However, the recent decline has been too violent, or there may be a small reaction.</p>

<p>The Zheng yarn market opened well in the morning, because American cotton rose again. Later, because the gold market fell sharply and silver prices rose, the market fell sharply in the second or third session. The 40-yuan mark was broken, and each month fell by four or five corners.

<h3 id="e261">Grain: Flour and Wheat Futures Plunge Together <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The flour market opened weak in the morning, because after the continuous turnaround in the flour market in recent days, various factories rushed to sell, but customer hoarding stagnated, and people's hearts tended to soften. Moreover, the dumping by the United States and the drop in Canadian wheat prices put pressure on the market. The factory forces are selling existing stocks, and because there are so many stocks of flour and wheat, and there are large loans of wheat and dumping of American wheat to China, they feel the danger of the flour market in the future, so they all want to sell it early. The thinking of each factory is the same, and then they scramble to sell, and all the large and small factories want to sell, and the bulls and new shorts also sell a lot, and the market immediately falls again and again. It has been a few cents short before noon, and it fell again in the afternoon. The market seems to have a collapse. The far month is particularly bad due to the impact of American and Canadian wheat, so the market prices for January and February are 4.75 cents short, December is 4 cents short, November is 3.75 cents short, and September and October are 2.5 cents short. The market closed weak.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, Canadian wheat suddenly fell about one yuan due to the prediction of a bumper harvest and the desire to rush to get out of the way, in the steady stand of American wheat, in order to occupy the lead in the future. The U.S. surplus wheat has a way out, and the U.S. authorities subsidized 20 cents and 15 cents, of which 15 million bushels were sold to China and 12 million bushels were sold to Japan. In the case of sluggish sales and falling prices of flour and wheat in China, and then this measure, the market immediately underwent tremendous changes, and all parties competed to come out, and the incoming households shrank, and no new questions were asked except to make up for the shortfall. The closing price for January and February was 4.75 cents short, September and October were 2.5 cents short, November was 3.75 cents short, and December was 4 cents short. There are few existing and stored existing wheat, the price of production is high, and the dealers have stopped. The owners of the goods are firm, and Gao Mai shouted for a big corner, but still failed to complete the transaction. However, the Zhong關wheat can be approached by both parties. Yesterday, 3,000 bales were sent from Fuzhou Office and 2,000 bales were sent to the scattered factory, and the prices of each wheat are the same as the previous market.</p>

<p>Because the source of new sesame is not surging, the local office's digestion is still healthy, so the market sees stable Chen芝 The digestion of Shaobang is also not weak, which makes the owners slightly tighten up and recover a few corners. Yesterday, this street took more than 200 bales of Danyang new sesame, priced at 7.9 and 7.8, and Shaobang went to Nanjin new tea sesame 230 bales, opening at 7.85, Yinzhou yellow sesame 1,020 bales, pulling at 7.6, Yinzhou white 324 bales, 7.15, and Dali set yellow sesame 78 bales, priced at 7.15.</p>

<p>In the European and American raw silk markets, raw silk consumption has decreased greatly recently due to sluggish sales of silk fabrics and the impact of labor unrest. The stock of silk is sufficient, which has led to a decline in the daily output of Chinese silk. Last week, the CPC only shipped 981 bales of yellow, white, and gray silk to European and American countries, and only 361 bales of waste silk, totaling 1,342 bales.</p>

<p>The existing silk inventory in Lyon and New York is very sufficient. Only 50% to 60% of the silk mills are open. The manufacturers have enough silk in their hands to meet the demand. No one asks about the existing silk, and the futures hoarders do not dare to hoard it at risk. The price of silk falls every day, and the sales of existing silk in Shanghai are stagnant.</p>

<h3 id="e272">The Evolution of Men <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>—旅隼</p>
<p>It may be a bit blasphemous to say that the mating of animals is love. However, animals also have sexual lives, and that cannot be denied. When their spring emotions are aroused, the females and males are together, inevitably having a bit of "you and I" time. Of course, the females sometimes pretend to be aloof, running a few steps and looking back, even making a few calls, until they carry out "cohabitation love." Although there are many kinds of animals and their "love" methods are complex, there is no doubt about one thing: the males do not necessarily have any privileges.</p>
<p>Humans are the most intelligent of all creatures, and the first thing is that men are very capable. In the beginning, it was rough and sloppy, but because of the saying "knowing the mother but not knowing the father," the women once "ruled" for a period of time. At that time, the old grandmothers were probably more powerful than the later clan chiefs. Later, I don't know how, women became unlucky: their necks, hands, and feet were all locked with chains,扣 with rings, and 环 although these rings have mostly become gold and silver over the millennia, and are镶 with pearls and real diamonds, these necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc. are still symbols of female slaves. Since women have become slaves, then men don't have to ask her for her consent to love) her. In ancient tribal wars, the result was that the captives would become slaves, and the female captives would be raped. At that time, the spring emotional arousal period had probably been "cancelled," and the male master could rape the female captives and female slaves anytime and anywhere. Modern gangsters and villains do not treat women as human beings, but in fact, it is a great legacy of chieftain-style chivalry.</p>
<p>However, although the ability to rape is already a step in the "evolution" of humans compared to animals, it is only semi-civilized after all. Think about it, how much fun can there be in a woman crying and wringing her hands? Since the appearance of money, this treasure, men's evolution has really been amazing. Everything in the world can be bought and sold, and sexual desire is naturally no exception. Men can spend a few stinky coins to get what they want from women's bodies. And he can say to her: I am not raping you, you are willing, you are willing to take these coins, you have to do this and that, do whatever I say, we are doing a fair transaction! After trampling on her, he also wants her to say "Thank you, Young Master." Is this something that animals can do? Therefore, prostitution is a fairly high stage of human evolution.</p>
<p>At the same time, the old-fashioned marriage of parents' orders and matchmakers' words is even more brilliant than prostitution. Under this system, men get permanent, lifelong living property. When the bride is put on the groom's bed, she only has obligations, she doesn't even have the freedom to protect the price, let alone love. Whether you love it or not, in the name of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius, you have to be faithful to the end, you have to maintain your chastity. Men can use her at any time, but she has to abide by the etiquette of the sages. Even if (evil thoughts are only moved in the heart, it is considered to have committed adultery. If male dogs use such clever and severe methods on female dogs, the female dogs will definitely be anxious to (jump over the wall). However, people will only jump into wells and become virtuous women, chaste women, and heroic women. The evolutionary significance of etiquette marriage can also be imagined.</p>
<p>As for men being able to use (the most scientific) theories to make women, even without etiquette, be willing to be single-minded to the end, and deeply believe that sexual desire is a (beastly desire) and should not be used as the basic condition for love; therefore, inventing (scientific chastity), that is, of course, the pinnacle of civilized evolution.</p>
<p>Alas, people Men are different from animals!</p>

<h3 id="e273">Stomach Disease <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>Stomach disease is really a terrible disease, especially linked to men of letters. Everyone knows that Su Manshu died of stomach disease, although he was a monk, he liked to eat braised beef with wine, and did not keep the Buddhist precepts, so he deserved to die, but because he was a wandering man of letters whose nationality and family background were not clear, it aroused the sympathy of several men of letters. Then there was Luo Heizhi, who also died of stomach disease, but he also suffered from heart disease, so when he walked, he either frowned and held his heart, or held his stomach with a bitter face. I remember it was early spring in 1928, when a friend who had just come to Nanjing from Changsha told me that Luo Heizhi was dead I was stunned by this unfortunate news, and I couldn't speak for a long time. I wrote a short poem mourning him:</p>
<p>Stealing a living in the world is also hard,</p>
<p>Burning the fire of the heart to turn the wheel of the heart.</p>
<p>Manshu did not make Jin Si die,</p>
<p>Spring grass is born in Jiangnan again.</p>
<p>Later, I heard that Heizhi's death, although originally ill, was because he was imprisoned for an article, and he was so angry that he died a few days after being released from prison, so I wrote another short poem mourning him</p>
<p>I wish to write a hundred thousand words of articles,</p>
<p>Dig out the liver and shed blood to tell the troubles.</p>
<p>The moon is like a lamp and the flower is like a pen,</p>
<p>Long stand by the soul of poetry to comfort the nine springs.</p>
<p>Two months ago, I saw Peng Jiahuang for the first time in front of Le Sibing's sickbed. He said that appendicitis was very dangerous, and Mr. Le was considered safe, but he himself often suffered from stomach problems. I saw that his haggard face, with a deep melancholy look, was a bit like Heizhi But I never expected that he would die soon. Naturally, it is not uncommon for Hunan people to suffer from stomach diseases, because they have no chili, and chili that is so spicy that they shed tears cannot be eaten with rice. Ten years ago, I suffered a very serious stomach disease. I lay in Xiangya Hospital and adopted a food reduction therapy. I starved for almost a month before I was considered to be starved. Since then, I have not dared to eat chili. For the past two or three years, I felt that the stomach disease had not occurred for nearly ten years. Seeing that the friends from my hometown were all spicy, and every time I ate with them, my throat was itchy and strangely hard to endure, so I tried the spicy taste. At the same time, because of the hardship of life, I often bought drunk to forget my worries, so my stomach disease broke out again. Now that I see Peng Jiahuang's death, I remember the distress of Heizhi's illness, and I also think of Zhu Jianfan's incurable stomach cancer. Is stomach disease so terrible</p>
<h3 id="e274">Correcting Mr. Qian Gechuan's Distortions <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Suo Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Qian said: (If we all had literary talent, we could, like Japan's Akita Ujaku, change course and learn Esperanto.) This is not true. Although classic works by Shakespeare, Pushkin, Gogol, Goethe, etc., have been translated into Esperanto, and recently, works such as "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Roar, China!" have also been translated into Esperanto, the application of Esperanto is not limited to "literature." Sun Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People" has been published in Esperanto, and "The Collected Works of Lenin" in Esperanto is also being compiled and translated. Because its "grammar is extremely simple and changes are regular," it is free from the "trouble of removing facial hair" and the inability to produce a menu. Therefore, "no literary talent is needed," and anyone can learn it. Those who have learned a certain foreign language will naturally find it easier to learn Esperanto, and it will definitely not be harmful to the foreign language already learned, so there is no such thing as "changing course."</p>
<p>Mr. Qian cited an example to prove that Esperanto does not work in "mainland China" hospitals, resulting in being given "several injections of saline." This is truly "deliberate hypothetical evidence to confuse the public." Taking a step back, even if Mr. Qian's hypothetical citation is possible, I think it would also be difficult for patients and nurses everywhere to converse using Basic English. If a patient needs "several injections of saline," they cannot use the word "syringe" but must say "a type of pointed tube with a plunger that uses air pressure to release water from its skin and then releases it into a very fine line for gardening, treatment, etc." (See "International Daily Selection," No. 40, "A Critique of Basic English by the British"). It can be seen that one still cannot avoid "looking angry."</p>
<p>Mr. Qian said that Esperanto's "shortcomings are that it is too early, its uses are uncertain, and even mixing written and spoken language is considered too lacking in books for us to read." Yes, Esperanto has only been around for forty-six years, and compared with the literature of various national languages, it is inferior in "quantity." However, just in terms of learning books, there are over ten million copies compiled in fifty-two languages (see E. Drezen's "The Problem of International Language," 1932 edition, pages 2-3). According to the International Radio Commission statistics, in 1929, various countries gave 2,006 speeches and reports in Esperanto. Esperanto is an international language, so it cannot be estimated solely by the "quantity" of its use. But what about Basic English? It was published in 1930, so its "duration" is knowable. Besides ten small booklets, what else is there? Is there a restaurant in the world that knows how to cook "(the white root that makes your eyes water)" or "(the bird that Noah sent out to see if there was land, cooked on the stove)" (roast pigeon)? Can its "uses" be said to be broad?</p>
<p>Mr. Qian said: (Because Russian is too difficult and cannot force people to learn it well, Russia uses Esperanto to communicate with the proletariat of various countries.) This is a distortion of Esperanto. It is not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. The popularity of Esperanto in Russia is because they recognize the necessity of an international language and the practicality of Esperanto. Esperanto itself is just a language, and it is certainly not impossible for it to be a tool for the proletariat of various countries, but it can also be used for other purposes. Let's take the facts in China as an example: In 1921, the Seventh National Education Conference of China held in Guangzhou resolved to add Esperanto to the curriculum of normal schools. The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters also compiled and printed "The Shandong Question," "The May 3rd Jinan Incident," and "The Tanaka Memorial" in Esperanto. As for the literature of various small and weak nations being transplanted to China, it was not through English or Basic English, but mostly through Esperanto, as evidenced by the translations of Esperanto comrades Zhou Zuoren, Hu Yuzhi, Wang Luyan, Ba Jin, Sun Yong, and Zhong Xianmin.</p>
<p>The above is a correction to Mr. Qian's misinterpretations. There is still much to say about Mr. Qian's claims, but I cannot allow "Free Talk" to be exclusively for my and Mr. Qian's "battleground," and the inaugural issue of Guanghua Bookstore's "Reader Monthly" ("Special Issue on Critique of Basic English") will also be published soon. If I discuss with Mr. Qian again, it should also be published in "Reader" or other places. Now I summarize my main points of view on Basic English: (1) No national (country's) language should be an international language; (2) Basic English violates language development, is anti-evolutionary, and is something that goes backward; (3) Basic English, due to its circuitous expression, is not easier than English, and is even worse than Esperanto; (4) Basic English is not a reasonable, appropriate, and usable plan for making English more logical.</p>
<h3 id="e275">### Six Dynasties Love Songs with the Same Motif <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>We know that folk literature is oral literature, passed down from person to person and from generation to generation. Therefore, regardless of the place, whether it is China or foreign countries, or the time, whether it is ancient or modern, we often find the same ballads or stories. The Six Dynasties love songs collected in the "Yuefu Poetry Collection" are no exception. Now, I list the similarities as follows:</p>
<p>(1) I think of my beloved, you travel with an unrestrained heart. Mist and dew hide the lotus, seeing the lotus is unclear.</p>
<p>(Note) This is one of the "Zi Ye Songs" and also appears in "Du Qu Ge," except that the first line is: (My heart is always uneasy,) "(Zi)" is made "(Huan,)" and "(Bu)" is made "(Ju.)"</p>
<p>(2) Relying on love as if to advance, shy and unwilling to come forward. Vermilion lips sing enchanting songs, jade fingers play delicate strings.</p>
<p>(Note) This is one of the "Zi Ye Songs" and also appears in "Zi Ye Jing Ge," except that "(Kou Zhu)" is made "(Zhu Kou.)"</p>
<p>(3) Looking up at the paulownia tree, the paulownia flowers are especially pitiful. I wish heaven had no frost or snow, so the wutong seeds could last for a thousand years.</p>
<p>(Note) This is one of the "Zi Ye Four Seasons Songs" and also appears in "Du Qu Ge," except that the first line is missing.</p>
<p>(4) The yellow swan flies into the sky, hesitating halfway. A chariot wheel turns in its belly, do you know who it is thinking of?</p>
<p>(Note) The previous three were merely transformations of Wu-style songs, that is, transformations within the Wu region. This is the "Huang Hu Song" of the Wu region and also appears in the "Xi Qu Ge Xiangyang Yue" of the Jingxiang area, except that the last line is: (Who does Huan pity today?)</p>
<p>(5) Long mast, iron deer's tail, cloth sail rises gracefully. Woe is me, where am I going, three thousand miles away.</p>
<p>(Note) This is the "Ao Nong Ge" of the Wu-style songs and also appears in the "Wu Ye Ti" of the "Xi Qu Ge," except that "(San)" is made "(Shu.)" (6) Sobbing and weeping in the dark, the setting sun shines into the tent. What is the suffering without oil, just let it be light tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Note) This is one of the "Du Qu Ge." There is also another song with the same title, the first two lines of which are (Lower the curtain, the lights are out, the bright moon shines into my bosom.) Also, "(Shi)" is made "(Ling.)" Perhaps these two songs are connected, just like the repeated chapters of the Book of Songs and the repeated sections of Yuan opera, and it is not necessarily a transformation. What is strange is that these two songs are not placed together but are separated by as many as thirty-three songs.</p>
<p>(7) Tonight we have happily parted, when will we meet again? The bright lamp shines on the empty chessboard, the date is distant and uncertain.</p>
<p>(Note) This is one of the "Zi Ye Songs" and also appears in "Du Qu Ge," (Tonight we have) is made (Holding hands with.)</p>
<p>(8) The apes of the Three Gorges of Badong cry sadly, crying three times at night, tears stain the clothes. (Note) This is the "Daughter's Son" of the "Xi Qu Ge" and also appears in the "Wu Xia" of "Miscellaneous Ballads and Songs." The "(Ye)" ape is made "(Yuan)".</p>

<p>— By Joseph Conrad, translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>(Time passes quickly… rumors arose among the women… our enemies were on the alert… my brother became gloomy, I began to think of killing and cruel death… Our race, like yours, the white race, must obtain what it loves. There is a time when men will forget loyalty and respect for elders. Power or prestige is given to a leader, but love, strength, and courage are given to all men. My brother said to me: (You can snatch her from among them. The two of us are like one person.) So I replied: (Do it quickly, because I feel that without her by my side, even the sun has no warmth.) Our opportunity came, and the chief took all the people with torches to the mouth of the river to fish. Thousands of small boats were released, and on the white sand between the water and the forest, leaf huts were built for the chief's family. Smoke rose like a blue mist of the night, and the voices of countless people cheerfully echoed in the area. As they were preparing their boats to go fishing, my brother came over and said to me: (Tonight!) I inspected my weapons, and when the time came, our boat joined the circle of countless boats lit by torches. The firelight flashed on the water, but behind the boats was darkness. When the shouting began and people were clamoring like madmen, we escaped. The water swallowed our torches, and we drifted back to shore, where it was dark except for the faint glow of occasional embers. We could hear the conversations of the slave women between the huts. Then we found a quiet and desolate place. We waited there. She came. She ran along the coast, quickly and without leaving a trace, like a leaf about to be blown into the sea by the wind. My brother said gloomily: (Go and carry her onto our boat.)</p>
<p>I held her in my arms. She was panting, her heart beating against my chest. I said:—I have taken you from those people. You ran to me in response to the call of my heart, but my arms must resist the will of the great one to carry you into my boat! (It is right,) my brother said: (We are a people who must obtain our desires, and we can withstand the majority of people. We should have snatched her in the daytime.) Then I said: (Let's set off;) because since she had come onto our boat, I began to think of the many people under the chief's command. (Yes, let's go,) my brother said: (We have been cast out from the group. Now this small boat is our country, and this sea is our hiding place.) One of his feet was still lingering on the shore, and I urged him to hurry up, because I remembered her heart beating against my chest, and I also thought that two people could not withstand a hundred people. We set off, going down the riverbank; when we passed the bay where they were fishing, the shouting had stopped, but the murmuring of the people was as noisy as the buzzing of insects at noon. Many boats drifted together in clusters, in the red glow of the torches, in the misty haze: people talked about games, those people, arrogant, boasting, mocking, who in the morning might still have been our friends, but by night had become our enemies. We rushed past quickly. We no longer have friends in our homeland. She sat in the middle of the boat, covering her face; as silent as she is now; as invisible as she is now, I do not regret my departure, because I can hear her breathing beside me—just as I can hear it now.)</p>
