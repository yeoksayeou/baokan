<h3>時評　羅斯福政府之暗礁（二）</h3>
<p>— 有</p>
<p>羅斯福政府現方籠罩於高度的通貨膨脹運動空氣之中。上自當局。下至農民。無論最後手段如何。殆莫不以貨幣底商品價值之降低爲目前逃出恐慌之絶妙方法。尤以美國參衆兩院大多數持撑通貨膨脹政策。爲足以說明美國貨幣政策之將來。蓋亦復興運動中可注意之現象也。</p>
<p>顧通貨膨脹政策。將果能有助於羅斯福之繁榮計劃耶。吾不能無惑焉。夫羅斯福自登臺以來。雖無日不以挽救恐慌爲目的。如停止金本位。如召開倫敦會議。如制定産業復興計劃。如修訂銀行法案。如大量收買公債。更如最近操縱國内外黃金市場。方法可謂多矣。然究其效力。不獨毫無收穫。且有益陷美國經濟於恐慌之勢。綜其過去政績。實無異以一憶二千萬人民之經濟生活。爲其一大試騐塲也。今之趨向於直接通貨膨脹之行程。殆爲其最終之試騐。然而伍定去職之日。垣街金融資本家爲擁護債權利益計。對於政府之攻擊。已不啻哀的美敦。觀於十八日美國全國總商會之决議。益足爲證。夫繁榮計劃之推動。固將以整個國民經濟爲對象。今農民鼓噪膨脹通貨之聲浪方殷。金融資本家之示威運動。復隨之而至。社會階層之對立。乃因通貨膨脹所生利益之轉變而促發。又將何解於復興運動之基本任務耶。</p>
<p>更有進者。通貨膨脹之效用。在於物價之向上。而尤在於購買之發達。與夫生産過剩之消滅。然後繁榮之基礎。方可確立不移。非然者。任何政策之試行。徒增社會矛盾之激烈。更無救於經濟之危機。兹但就羅斯福登台以後之事實而觀察之。即足以說明之矣。據美國聯邦準備銀行所發表之各種指數。係以一九二三至一九二五年之平均數爲基準。特爲錄之如次。</p>
<p>一九三三三月　一九三三七月</p>
<p>製造生産　五七·○　一○·一○</p>
<p>工廠僱傭　五六·六　七○·一</p>
<p>工廠七資　三六·九　四九·九</p>
<p>商店銷售　五五·○　七一·○</p>
<p>觀上數字。自三月至七月間。製造生産之增加達百分之七十七。而工廠工資之增加。則只百分之三十五。工廠雇傭之增加。更不過百分之二十三。是生産之提高。旣超過工資總額增加之速率。而工人雇備之增加。尤落於生産前進之後。觀於商店銷售之停滯。尤證社會購買力之疲弱。若是者生産過剩之矛盾不除。斯無怪乎經濟恐慌之僵局終無由打開。夫以羅斯福政府積數月之心力。而所得效力。僅僅如是。今謂藉通貨膨脹之方法。而即可立致繁榮。非吾人所敢信。隔昨（十八日）羅斯福在薩伐那城之講演。自承經濟沈痼。已歷十二年之久。欲求治愈。使全部均沾其益。其事匪易。且非一年之間所能有濟。如此則可見復興計劃成功之不易矣。</p>

<h3>英法美意諒解　歐局另作總解决　軍縮休會對德進行談判　國聯盟約聞將大加修改</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）軍縮會主席漢德森今日與日内瓦列强代表續談軍縮問題後、已召集主幹部於星期三日開會、列强已推定起草委員會、繕具總委員會休會至國聯行政院一月十日開會後再行召集之議案、提交主幹部、同時技術委員會則於休會後仍繼續七八日、而在此時期中、各國政府連德國在内、將互換外交文件、以期整理此種局勢、聞其所談判者、將越出軍縮會結搆之外大約最有關係之列强、將於明年一月間會議、據人傳說、事態已大有進步、雖法外長彭古亦以討論之進行爲滿意、</p>
<p>英外相西門今夜赴倫敦、但遇必要時、仍將返日内瓦、據現象觀之、主幹部將於星期三日休會、西門似無復來之必要、英外部次官艾登將留住日内瓦爲英國代表、國聯秘書長愛文諾定今夜赴羅馬、名爲參加謝樂加之殯禮、但衆信愛氏將討論意國對國聯之態度、</p>
<p>今日討論軍縮時、未曾提及漢德森辭職問題、大約漢德森對於會議而發之激憤語、已獲效果、而目前環境下之休會、在漢德森視之、殆已不作延宕之解矣、</p>
<p>衆信英外相西門之來遊日内瓦已使空氣澄清、彭古聲稱、英法態度已較前更爲接近、據一般意見、外交方面之互換公文、當可有眞正進步之最好機會、所謂談判範圍將越出軍縮會之外者、含有國聯之改組及薩爾區域之前途、亦皆付諸討論之意、果爾、則將來所召集之會議、實異於軍縮會議、無怪乎有會議將在意國舉行之謡傳矣、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日午後四大國會商後、已在原則上同意、暫停軍縮會議工作、以待與德國進行私人談判、惟最後决定、尚須待今日英美法意四國代表之重行集議、然後提出明日主幹委員會議表决通過、據聞此四大國與德國立即在意大利開始談判一層、現已不成問題、至軍縮會議休會之久暫、今日當可决定、預料會務殆將停頓至一月底、此時則英法意三國、立由其外交代表分頭接洽商定與德國開始私人談判之日期與地點、聞意代表德蘇拉格那今日猶未向各國代表通知意相邀請在羅馬談判意、但觀察時事者、皆信一俟軍縮會議决定暫停進行後、德氏即發出此種邀請、今晚美代表團發言人宣佈、昨日四國會商時、美代表韋爾遜曾正式提議擴大私人談話範圍、加入他國、主席漢德森表示贊成、但爲意英法三國代表所反對、按美國所欲邀請加入者、顯爲日本與蘇俄云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>愛文諾訪墨索里尼協商　國聯改組計劃　盟約與凡爾賽和約分離　俾美俄德日四國悉加入</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）意大利退出國聯之形勢、現已充分嚴重、有使國聯秘書長愛文諾專訪意相墨索里尼之必要、且聞大舉改組國聯結構計劃、目下亦已在考慮中、愛文諾係今夜啓程赴羅馬、表面上雖稱往送意前外相及一九二九年國聯行政院主席謝樂加之喪、但自可靠方面、聞其眞目的、在勸說墨索里尼勿退出國聯、此間外交界要人已徵實愛文諾突然决定羅馬之行、係在接閱意國態度之秋密消息後、而熱知國聯内情之某外交家、亦謂此間及歐美各國之政治家、皆認意國退出國聯之威脅、最爲嚴重問題、至改組國聯計劃已在考慮之說、雖爲極有關係之某君所否認、但從可靠方面深悉、此時確已策劃大事變更國聯之結構與政策、某君之所以否認、殆恐未到時機即行披露後、反將妨礙進行故耳、據聞此次改組之目標、欲使國聯之權力更見普遍、及處理世界問題、更易於實行、頃從極可靠方面聞悉、愛文諾在赴羅馬前、曾將修改盟約與改組國</p>
<h3>墨索里尼之豪語　視國聯爲病人　意大利無意遽離病床</h3>
<p>羅馬首相墨索里尼已向法大使聲明、彼之政策無意脫離國聯云、法西斯黨大議會將於十二月五日討論意大利與國聯關係問題、但此僅爲通常之手續、蓋自德國退出國聯會後、此爲法西斯黨大議會之第一次會議、一年前、該會討論國聯會問題時、首相墨索里尼即有國聯會今爲一病人、意大利不應遠離病床之言、此間大衆咸認如意國果欲退出國聯、則英意間友好之關係必趨緊張云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>聯之方法、徵詢比國著名法學家蒲爾金、蒲氏現任比國軍縮會議代表及日内瓦國際研究院敎授、據聞渠已草成一改組新計劃、惟蒲氏本人、今夜猶加以否認、僅承認愛文諾曾蔣改　問題、徵渠意見而已、然一般接近蒲氏者、則言之鑿鑿、據稱蒲氏已草成一計劃、擬將國聯盟約與凡爾賽和約互相分離、並將盟約大加修改、擴大國聯之宗旨、同時减輕保障和約寶任、俾美俄德日四國悉可加入、此外擬擴大行政院理事名額、添設執行委員會、減少國聯大會之秘密會議、至若現行盟約十六欵内之軍事閥裁、在蒲氏新提議内、或將刪去、此間意人方面、現認愛文諾在勸說意國留於國聯時、未必不將此項改組意見、向墨索里尼提出云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>英意發起　新國際會議說　討論世界重要政治問題</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）據今日此間所接傳播甚廣而完全未徵實之消息、英相麥唐納或意相墨索里尼不久將召集一新國際會議、討論世界重要政治爭點、與會者將限於若干選定之大國與小國、連美國·蘇俄·及日本在内、其所討論之問題、首爲改組國聯、修改盟約、次即國聯委託統治地問題云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬據今日此間消息靈通方面之情報、法西斯領袖將利用十二月初法西斯黨大議會開會之時機、正式表示意國對國聯之立塲、至外間謡傳意相墨索里尼將重定外交政策一節、當局已切實聲明、總方針將不更變、惟將主張先行召集列强會議、次再召集軍縮大會、認眞從事工作、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據巴黎晚報日内瓦訪員電稱、「小軍縮會議」大約將儘速在意國桑米摩舉行、法外長彭古擬往參加、與會者不僅爲四强公約簽字國、凡與德法親善有直接關係之諸國、如蘇俄·波蘭·比利時·小協約國、均將參加、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）德國與四大國立即在意大利開始談判、固屬不成問題、但料英·法·意·仍將由其駐德大使接洽一過渡會議、俾運縮會議重行召集時、可以迅速進行云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）此間傳聞軍縮會議或可在日内瓦以外地方開會、而由德國參加關於此節、本社昨日最初有所報告、但此事或爲實際、或爲一種試探、尚當加以斟酌、但以實際而言、則本社代表今晨猶從美國最可靠方面得有證實、謂英國外相西門在返倫敦之前、曾向美國代表試探、如英國或意國提議軍縮會議在日内瓦之外開會、則美國政府將取何釋態度、本社更聞悉、軍縮會議主席漢特森曾向蘇俄代表德甫珈萊夫斯基作同樣之試探、此間外交界聞悉漢特森提出此種交涉、甚爲驚異、蓋就漢特森個人而言、似不宜撤開日内瓦而在意國某城舉行一種歐洲會議、今漢特森乃有此種舉動、有人解釋謂彼曾獲有英意兩國政府保證、或且獲有德國政府保證、謂仍有任務可執、例如在此</p>

<p>歐洲會議中、充任軍縮委員會之主席是也、此外又向漢特森保證、不問此種會議結果如何、日内瓦軍縮會議、仍將加以討論、至少當加以認可、以上所謂實際不過如此、舍此而外、一經談及歐洲會議開會日期及議程、則含糊與假擬之處不一而足、細思之、此種會議即便成功、未必在本年之内明歲之初能以舉行、緣各大國昨日曾經决定、由外交途徑覓取軍縮會議解决方案、此事自非一日一月之間所能奏功、觀於四强公約談判情形、須時至數星期之久、即知未來軍縮公約亦必曠日廢時而後有成、至歐洲會議之議程、據聞各主持人之意、此種會議應有一較軍縮會議尤爲廣泛之議程、其性質殆爲一種和平會議、換言之即修改現行條約之會議是也、似此英國或意大利在表示確切見地以前、此種會議能否舉行未便加以論斷但此種計劃、、各國多有熱烈反對者、尤其是波蘭與小恊商各國、對於一種歐洲會議、涉及修改現行條約者絶非所願聞然則此種計劃在數日之内恐無進展、而英國則仍維持此種見解、繼續試探、且以外間已多洩漏此種主張、故英國之能度、乃愈出以審愼云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日英皇在貴族院致匣會開幕訓辭時、忽有議員麥戈文中途阻撓、大呼失業將如何解决、爾輩懶惰寄生虫、生活於他人所造成之財富、當知自愧、請念及外間飢餓垂斃之人、事後麥戈文又語新聞記者云、余並無悔憾、當時余憤懣已極、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<h3>日本已成暗殺世界　若槻昨晨兩次遇險　上野站至大和村先後遇剌倖免　兇手爲拳術家及退伍兵均被逮　暗殺原因爲反對倫敦海軍條約</h3>
<p>（東京）今晨有人行剌倫敦海軍會議日本首席代表若槻未成、若槻今晨適由某地返抵東京、當下車時、有青年一人、手執七首、排衆直入、企圖行剌、但未抵若槻身旁、即被警察執獲、</p>
<p>若槻曾兩任總理、兩任藏相、一任内相、兩任大藏省次官、爲日政界有數之要人、彼已遇險數次、蓋日人愛國猛熱者認彼簽定海軍比率協定、實有損於日本國防、以賣國賊目之、今晨之兇手、爲日本著名拳術家名野口、同時又有某青年亦企圖行剌、但在警察趕到時業已逃逸、聞今日之事件、與最近之反對倫敦海軍條約運動有關云、</p>
<p>今晨偕野口行剌若槻不果而逃逸之兇手、旋復徘徊若槻宅外、圖作第二次行剌、當爲警察拘獲、其人名松井、兩兇手皆爲某反動會會員、惟據野口供稱、渠因五月十五日案等株連之海軍見習生、近受軍事裁判、故憤及海軍條約、遂行剌若槻、未與松井同謀、但野口已供明渠與松井近購七首、專圖行剌若槻云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>兩次行剌未成</h3>
<p>（東京）民政黨總裁若槻禮次郎出席北時方面之黨大會、二十一日向東京、於上午七時到上野車站、即由大門出、將乘汽車之時、忽有一兇漢、由羣衆中躍出、手持短刀、欲剌若槻、然未接近其身邊之前、被護衛警員逮捕、若槻回宅之後、上午八時四十分復由上野車站搭車赴伊豆别莊、（二十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）圖剌若槻之供犯松井治雄、見野口被捕、即將逃逸、然直至本鄕大和村之若槻邸宅、企圖再度行兇、在宅前被發見、即將就逮、松井今年十月退伍、平常喜談愛國問題、（二十一日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>若槻處之泰然</h3>
<p>熱海在上野站幸而免災之若槻總裁、已於前九時五分、由東京車站、前往伊東之别莊、中途在熱海車站下車、據其所談如左、「無論往何處、應遭難者、則無法避免、故余常抱有充分之覺悟、故助與否皆無關緊要、付諸運命可也」若滕此次遇險、頗處之泰然云、（二十一日日聯電社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晨在寓所與上野車站兩被狙擊之若槻禮次郎男、在寓所謂生死在天、生命已貢獻於國家云云、語時態度從容、與平時無異、若槻氏仍照預定於上午九時五分由東京車站往伊東靜養、擬在該處居留一星期云、（二十一日電通電）</p>
<h3>兇手行剌目的</h3>
<p>（東京）警視廳逮捕剌若槻之兇漢後、即解廳嚴重傳訊、兇漢姓名爲野口進、現年二十七歲、係擊拳之重量級選手、屬於兵庫縣嘉納賢次郎創辦之日本擊拳俱樂部、最近與英國亞洲艦隊選手比賽時、肋骨受傷、乃由兵庫縣來東京沿線者也、彼性質頗粗暴、曾犯過傷害罪、當局現正調查其行兇目的動機及其背幕關係等、又由其懷中查出勸告書一封、兇手尚有一人、但見目的未達、即逃逸人羣中、當局嚴探其下落中、又電、圖剌若槻之兇手爲野口進與松井治雄兩人、均爲愛國青年聯會會員、該會由五一五事件海軍被告之律師林逸郎所創立、（二十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）據警廳調查、野口進於十月八日由神户至東京、本月六日、關於暗殺濱口首相之佐鄕屋案、彼曾在法院傍聽、乃與其友松井治雄談論該案、謂佐鄕屋被宣判死刑、原係倫敦條約失敗之結果、應由若槻男爵自刎以謝其罪、並决定向若槻氏勸告、促其自殺、與松井商議數次、訂於本月十九日乘若槻由上野車站出發時、面遞勸告書、而實行要挾、並購以短刀二柄、於廿一日午前六時四十五分在上野車站相待若槻氏之來駕、野口乃出以勸告書與短刀、正在脅迫之際、被警察捕獲、當時松井復追及若槻氏所乘之汽車、隨即亦被警士拘獲、聞警察方面對於野口所犯、將有處以脅迫罪之意向、查野口所持之勸告文、其内容大要如左、「佐鄕屋被處死刑、當係倫敦條約失敗之結果、其罪應由若槻男爵自刎以謝之」云、（二十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）在警視廳之野口進、始終否認與右翼團體有關係、及其背後黑幕、自供因憤慨倫敦條約、故有此行、然當局認其背後有日本擊拳會長嘉納賢次郎之策動、進行調查中、（二十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）迎擊若槻男爵之野口進之眞意、並不在暗殺若槻男、而在勸告切腹、但事件之背後似有團體組織之嫌、因此警視廳極力搜索該背後之黑幕、結果或將有第二之血盟團發見也、（二十一日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）愛國社主岩田愛之助、對於狙擊若槻民政總裁事件、談話如下、野口與松井、向係吾社之同人、野口於四五年前、轉任拳鬥家、松井則入台灣獨立守備隊、與愛國社已斷絶關係、十月下旬拳鬥大會時、野口突然來訪、彼時以爲彼之思想、諒無變化云、（二十一日電通電）</p>

<h3>本市新聞　閩變後各方消息　民衆代表會巧電内容　廢戰會馬電忠告蔣蔡　閩團體電請維持常態</h3>
<p>遠東社云、閩省政變現已成爲事實、其所組織之人民政府經於前月宣告正式成立、遠東社記者、昨從各方面、探悉其前前後後、所得消悉、爰爲分誌如次、</p>
<h3>民衆代表大會</h3>
<p>據關係方面傳出消息、陳（銘樞）蔡（廷楷）諸人、對於新政府之組織、籌謀已久、陳銘樞之僕僕港閩間、即專爲與各方面聯絡迨計議已定、遂倉卒返閩、嗾其左右於十八日晨、在漳州舉行一「全國民衆代表大會、」而决議以大會名義、要求陳蔡李（濟深）等、出而組織「人民政府」並確定暫假漳州爲政府臨時首都、報載其政府成立於福州云者、實係傳聞之誤、</p>
<h3>巧電内容大意</h3>
<p>是日並以大會名義發出巧電電文由電報局拍發、用油印印就從他方面寄出者、旅滬閩人私人方面業於前晚（二十日）接得文長八百餘字、該項電文、仍標榜抗日勦匪兩事</p>
<h3>再發成立通電</h3>
<p>陳等旣已接受十八日民衆代表大會之要求、事前均有凖備、故亦無須多事舖張、遂於二十日晨復在漳州召開市民大會、宣佈成立「人民政府、」即於當日發出成立通電、查是項通電、南京中央方面業於前日接得、至滬市政府方面、聞亦已同時接得、但吳市長向記者表示、則稱尚未接到、</p>
<h3>蔣光鼐被扣說</h3>
<p>昨日本埠盛傳一奇突消息、謂蔣光鼐有被陳銘樞等扣留之說、查日前報章爭載閩事爲陳蔣蔡等所主動奔走規劃者籌之已久、乃此次其政府成立之消息傳出、而組織中並無蔣之頭銜列入、是不無使人懷疑之處、因、而傳蔣已被扣云云、但據記者從另一方面探悉此實神經過敏者之談、實則因或種關係、蔣暫隱其名耳、</p>
<h3>中央暫不出兵</h3>
<p>至中央對於閩事、業於前日通電全國、着各軍政機關迅予處置、惟悉、中央對於過去任何事變向主從政治方面解决、决不輕動干戈、重苦人民、故此次之於閩變、仍擬派員前往疏解、而暫不以兵戎相見、</p>
<h3>留滬中委態度</h3>
<p>記者昨曾分訪留滬中委李烈鈞·何世禎·孫鏡亞·桂崇基·等氏、叩以對於閩事之態度、渠等均稱、閩方所發通電、余等尚無一人寓目、故閩事之個中眞相、余等未盡明瞭、在眞相未明瞭以前、實未便表示態度、俟稍遲二三日、或有所言、亦未可知云云、至行政院長汪精衛夫人陳璧君女士、雖已於昨晨七時許由京乘夜快車抵滬、報載汪夫人此來、係爲訪留滬中委、探詢對於閩事態度、但何·孫·桂·諸氏、接見記者談話時、均稱汪夫人並未來訪、嗣記者晤汪夫人於褚民誼氏私宅、汪夫人僅稱「不知」二字、意殆係否認所事耳、</p>
<h3>日本派艦駛閩</h3>
<p>閩事發生後、日本異常重視、今且藉口保僑、即將由馬公港派出驅逐艦六艘、分駛福州厦明兩地、意圖觀望、</p>
<p>新聲社云閩變徵實後、中央决取嚴厲處置、惟中委陳璧君來滬與各中委接洽、於昨晨抵滬、廢止内戰大同盟電蔣蔡、勸其實踐不參加内戰之聲明、懸崖勒馬、兹分誌如下、</p>
<h3>陳璧君昨來滬</h3>
<p>前日中政會開會時、各中委推中委陳璧君氏來滬、與留滬中委接洽應付閩變事宜、陳氏當晚夜車出京、於昨晨抵滬、</p>
<h3>廢戰會發馬電</h3>
<p>廢止内戰大同盟會、自閩變消息到滬、即召集值日常委討論、昨午發電勸告蔣蔡云、福州蔣主席蔡主任勛鑒、變訊傳來、驚愕萬狀、公昔在滬、曾有不參加内戰之聲明、言猶在耳、豈竟忘心、政見異同、應由政治解决、求之軍事、治絲益棼、况東省失地、尚未收復、世界大戰、轉瞬即發、國内民生凋敝、此情此景、詎堪鬩牆、敢祈懸崖勒馬、載戢干戈、儲備力量、爲對外用、敢進忠告、惟希採納、廢止内戰大同盟會總會叩、馬、</p>
<h3>陳肇英已返京</h3>
<p>中央於閩變未發生前、曾决定推陳肇英·段錫朋·二氏赴閩調查疏解、陳氏前日來滬後、正擬摒擋首途、得悉政變已徵實、以去亦無益、即中止前往、前晚已返京、至段錫朋氏則始終未離京、</p>
<h3>滬閩電報已通</h3>
<p>滬閩間電報、因築路轟山、損及報線、自十九晚中斷後、昨晨江山浦城間報線已修復、自十時四十四分起、通福州之報機、已可通、照常收發電報、惟因檢查甚嚴、收發送達、不若以前之迅速、中國航空公司滬粤線、昨晨亦照常南飛、郵政儲匯局、對福州厦門等處、匯兌事務并未奉命停止、亦照常辦理國聞社云、閩省獨立、由李濟深·陳銘樞·等另組人民政府、其通電業於二十日發出、中央銀行、在福州厦門之分行、業經閩方實行接收、而尤以海軍在閩之機關爲獨多、其駐於馬尾之陸戰隊現已於十八日被繳械其他國營之交通機關、及稅收機關、現全入於閩軍監視之下、昨日記者經各方之探詢、所得詳情、彚誌如下、</p>
<h3>中鈔僅能納稅</h3>
<p>中央銀行在福州·厦門分行、自綏靖主任蔡廷錯派李超恒葉紹泉·接收改組並暫停營業後、所有中央銀行紙幣、在閩省已不能通行、昨據本埠銀行界所得確訊、閩省所有中央紙幣、除完納國家稅地方稅外、其餘一概不能流通云、</p>
<h3>海軍兩艦駐閩</h3>
<p>海軍在閩之機關頗多、如海軍陸戰隊、海軍練營、長門要塞、厦門海軍航空處、馬江海軍學校、馬尾厦門兩處海軍造船所等、除陸戰隊分駐漳厦泉閩三都馬尾外、其他均有一定地點、記者昨日由本埠海軍方面探獲閩變後消息、據談、馬尾陸戰隊、已於十八日、由十九路軍派兵二千接收、惟駐紥該處之陸戰隊、人數祇二三十名、故當即移交並未發生事端、惟大部陸戰隊、則駐於三都、至於厦門航空處、現有飛機約六七架、及長門要塞海軍造船所等、至昨日止、未有人前往接收、故來滬航空處長陳文麟、亦已於昨日飛返厦門、現海軍軍艦之駐泊馬江與厦門者、祇有海鳧與海寗兩小艦、海部是否須派艦前往、據談者稱、須候命中央辦理、亦尚未至必要、外傳日艦駛閩、將有舉動、並非信史、總之、其意藉護僑以示威而已、陳季良司令晋京、至昨未返、凡在閩之中央稅收機關則自十九日起、已全入閩政府之手、閩人民政府成立之通電、昨日本埠海軍設於吳淞之海岸電台、曾收獲一通、當轉呈高昌廟司令部、内容言抗日勦共、未見原文云、</p>
<h3>招商輪未被扣</h3>
<p>招商局爲國營交通機關之一、在福州曾設有分局、厦門設有代辦處、記者恐閩方有扣輪之事發生、故特趨晤該局總務科長陳蔚青氏、據談、招商局走閩輪舶祇泰順一般、現已在途約明日可抵滬、中央銀行在閩分行、固已被人收没、但招商分局、未有確實消息、閩分局長前日來滬、現轉杭州、故一切俟該分局返去、方能知悉、總之招商局在閩産業、祇分局房屋數幢、屋基與空地數畝、貨棧四處、以及碼頭等、爲數　少、以後航輪之是否再靠閩厦、現公司中尚須考慮、惟至目下止、招商局航輪、未有一艘經閩方之扣留云、</p>
<h3>滬粤飛機照常</h3>
<p>中國航空公司滬粤航線、甫告完成、全程共七站、福州厦門、均爲降落之分站、此次閩局陡變後、該公司係商辦民航機關、完全爲營業性質、故昨據該公司中職員稱、閩事與滬粤線、毫不影響、昨晨由滬飛粤之班機、於清晨六時零五分、仍照常飛出、在閩厦兩站、照常降落、由粤來滬之機、則於今日可抵滬云、</p>

<h3>滬閩商業影響</h3>

<p>此次市立務本女中學生因反對敎務主任發生風潮、各報所載、傳說不一、其中有涉及前校長王孝英、及中國女中者、有涉及其他自動辭職之敎職員者、以致眞相莫明、誤會滋甚、一昨該校新舊校長夫婦、及自動辭職之敎職員等數人、由新校長邀宴於大西洋西菜社、各述此次學潮之經過、眞相大白、誤會冰釋、爰共同發表談話如下、查此次務本發生學潮、在新校長視事後一週、顯與校長問題無涉、嗣以下列各項問題、致引起各方而之誤會、兹爲愛護該校之各界人士明瞭眞相起見、分條解釋於後、</p>
<p>（一）自治會成立之經過學潮初起、卽有疑及利用學生自治會、以爲武器、其實暑假期内、校中早奉特别市黨部訓令、組織學生自治會、因當時前校長辭意已决、正候敎育局物色繼任人選、故除維持按外時上課、其他課外活動、均不願舉辦、迨後市黨部迭令催促、限兩星期内成立、不得已囑訓育處將訓令大意、通告學生、自行决定、以示不再負指導之責、觀此自治會之組織、乃學校校例行公事、並無何種特殊使命、</p>
<p>（二）新舊校長交代之經過學潮起後、卽有謂前校長不肯交代之謡傳、其實新校長發表之日、卽由前校長勸其從速接收、早日到校視事、以免學校精神渙散、故新校長三日發表、翌日上午十時、卽由前校長親自到校、會同各處主任點交、至於經濟部分、因本年度八九十三個月須俟敎育局預算决定、方能着手編製决算、呈局報銷、及歷次呈准敎局開銷完竣之臨時費、及十月份經常費尚未領到、故尚有一部無從移交、其餘已移交清楚、事實俱在、所謂交代不清、及無從接收云云、盡是無稽之談、</p>
<p>（三）學生代表赴中國女中開會中國女中校址接近務本、故有初中一二年級學生來校補習、好事者故意播弄、卽指捕習學生爲務本自治會代表查務本學生代表、除有一次由新校長嘯師三學生、面請陳珪如敎員、打銷辭意、曾到中國女中外、（中有此次被休學之方秀芝）所有高級學生、及學生會代表、從未到過一次、中國女中之敎職員、自信對於敎育、尚有相當認識、决不順以學校爲是非埸所、肄意破壞敎育、摧殘青年、自廿爲敎育界之罪人也、</p>
<p>（四）學潮導火線之眞相務本敎員中有某敎員因上課時、與一二學生偶有失感、卽疑係前師範科主仟某所挑撥、因此發生誤會、時有怨言、說者無心、聽者有意、輾轉相傳、遂成錯誤、其實彼輩皆係私人糾葛、言語範圍、亦與中國女中無關、接近新校長方面者、誤以爲與學校頗有關係、適新敎務主任到校、學潮爆發、各方面竟因此引起重重之誤會、學潮亦以各種誤會、而幾至無可收拾、幸新舊校長、原爲同學、均以敎育爲立塲、以愛護務本爲前提、開誠布公、共同談話、並有某某敎員到場聲明、渠平時所言、皆係個人問題、無關學校、不料從中有人輾轉傳說、致釀成此次之誤會、新舊校長、以重重誤會、一朝冰釋、均學甚爲滿意、致中國女中、開學雖遲、亦已照常上課、當由該校長向局長陳述經過、已無問題、一埸公案、已大白於天下、可以從此了結矣、</p>

<h3>昨晚女籃球　東南三隊全勝　甲組大敗曁南　比數卅九比五　丨今晚三塲比賽丨</h3>
<p>昨晚女籃球賽之三組勝利、均爲東南女體師、且均爲一面倒之形勢、强東五十五比十六勝美專、强南四十八比十三勝上中、甲組東南三十八比五大敗曁南、甲組比賽、精彩異常、曁南强勁非凡、攻守俱嚴、但東南吃緊工作、嚴密戒備、竟使曁南一籌莫展、劉瑪琍雖很、困於嚴守、施展不得、所獲五分、罰中其三、投中僅一、任淑嬌若游龍、的是可兒、兹將詳情述下、</p>
<h3>文華女士連中三元</h3>
<p>甲組戰幕揭起、曁南女將個個魁偉其軀、勇猛非凡、左衝右突、銳不可當、盤旋籃下、躍躍欲試、東南嚴加佈防、毫不放鬆、相持未久、劉瑪琍罰球開　　、東南不以爲意、前鋒大施活動、不以對方防禦固鞏而减色、劉文華穩健有加、連中三元、聲勢大振、廖祝元調渡得法、任淑亦告中的、第一節終了、曁南僅由劉瑪琍再加一分、東南以九比二佔先、</p>
<h3>任淑小姐嬌若游龍</h3>
<p>曁南不甘雌伏、努力反攻、劉瑪琍雌心勃勃、不讓鬚眉氣概、屢次遠射、惜乎法不靈、目光不準、毫不中的、且前綫不能聯絡、加以籃下無隙可乘、徒喚奈何、東南活動愈甚、曁南防犯愈嚴、任淑小姐、神出鬼没、嬌若游龍、二次邊球遠射、博得掌聲雷動、是節表演、最爲劇烈、曁南仍無建樹、僅由劉瑪琍籍罰球加上一分、上半時終了、東南十五分、曁南三分、</p>
<h3>瑪琍姑娘大發雷霆</h3>
<p>再戰聲起、曁南報復心切、極力掙扎、但處處被敵監視、難於活動、劉瑪琍不學殺得火起、大發雷霆、咆哮一聲、令人一驚、同時掌聲大作、笑聲滿堂、然左右手不能呼應、獨木難支大厦、東南前鋒繼續又得七分、曁南一無所獲、第三節終了、東南以二十二比三勝、</p>
<h3>再衰而竭一敗塗地</h3>
<p>三節終了、曁南竟未投中一球、僅由罰球取得三分、故在最後一節、力爭投籃機會、但球到籃下、時爲對手攫得、奈何不得、再接再厲方由何夢華射中一球加上二分、機衛堅持奮鬥、顧此失彼、疲於奈命、東南前鋒、益形得勢、投籃如串珠、又得十六分之多、最後結果、東南以三十八比五勝、裁判員施肇康、甲乙三組马績錄下、</p>

<h3>大將受傷銳氣立墮</h3>
<p>約翰熟於地勢、交綏之下、立時活躍、誠周努力、各有建樹、四分居先、喜氣滿堂、大夏乃屈於一時、並非弱者之流、臨時休戰、以冀挽回果然轉眼之際、連得八分、高居其上、相差有半約翰知勁敵在前、不易對付、亦停止軍事行動、另籌妙策、從此兩軍内外健全分數互在一二分上下、十二·十六並數累見、忽而陳争球遭傷、形勢猝變、約翰遂扶摇直上、以二十五比十七占先、上半時</p>
<h3>主軍逞强形勢顯分</h3>
<p>下半場、均等局勢、轉成高下、約翰乘勝餘之威、無往不利、加以同學熱烈之呼呐、聲勢亦熾、幾乎握全局中樞、指揮如意、幸而大夏軍心一致、處困苦艱難之境、依然奮發有爲、勉强支持、否則不免全軍崩潰、結果約翰五十一比三十勝、</p>

<h3>專件　歐洲各國體育新趨勢　程登科講述江南體師沙仲箎筆記</h3>
<p>我國無論何事、均未上軌道、體育僅其一端耳、憶余初人柏林體大時、敎授問及我國整個體育之組織系統及趨勢如何、余瞠目無以爲對、余厠身體育界尚如此、其他勞働大衆、更不言而喻、繼余允以一九三六年歐林匹克在柏林舉行時、當能詳覆、但已自覺醜態畢露、慚愧莫名、此爲余生平莫大之恥辱、觀諸歐洲各國體育之進步、蒸蒸日上、與夫組織之眞密、設施之妥善、殊足驚人、其目的除强身外、兼作政府之後援、以體育闢以軍事訓練、貫以一致之精神、精誠團結、務使國家或個人得體育之眞正效果、故其每一青年均須受體育訓練、丨丨軍事化的體育訓練、使其體能增加、借鏡於古之希臘民族、所以能强大之原因、實行復古、故其口號爲體育軍事化」「軍事體育化」、兹將其體育設施之梗概、分别述後、</p>
<p>土耳其丨丨吾等皆知土耳其爲老大古國、是西方的中國、素來不注意體育、以故人民體質織弱、精神萎靡、爲列强所鄙棄、今則自凱末耳將軍執政以來、實行復興運動、大加革新、遣派大批固内優秀份子及對於體育、感有興趣者、出國研究體育、往德國者最多、同時並重金聘請德國體育專家、來國設計創辦大規模之國立體育大學、以達其强國强種之衷旨、吾知其下屆世界運動會中、土耳其國旗、必將給人以深刻之印象矣、意大利丨丨首相墨索里尼、彼以法西斯蒂之精神提倡體育、特别注意於青年體育與兒童運動、此乃與土耳其稍有不同、墨氏最近在羅馬設立墨索里尼體育大學、設有體育博士學位、（記者按、各國尚無此學位、）學校之建設、富麗堂皇、地面舖以水門汀、牆壁砌以大理石、但不輕易給人參觀、非得墨氏之簽字、任何團體及個人、均遭拒絶、此係主義之關係、余等去參觀該校、先請德國敎育部通知墨氏、但尚未窺得全豹、意大利對於體育、有整個通盤之標凖及訓練、而其每青年之制服、亦一如軍隊、此體育之趨向于軍善化、由此可見、且墨氏對於體育敎師、尤其嚴格考核、因彼等應作青年之模範與導師、意人之口號、爲「集中人材」、「團結整個」、「繫國家於體育」、與我國體育界同人之各自爲政、不可同日而語矣、</p>
<p>德意志丨丨德意志體育上一切之設施、類似意國、惟民族性比意國奮發、柏林國體大之學生、恒與羅馬意體大之學交換上課、但僅以一二人爲限、從前外國學生來德國體大攻讀者、可佔半數、現政府已通令該校、俟後絶對不許錄取外國學生、施行獨裁、總之、德國一切、均仿效意國、卽政府之組織亦如意國、蓋同化於墨氏也、德國現在最時髦之越野跑爲武裝競走、換言之、卽荷槍負彈戎裝之競走也、德國每三年能訓練十萬下級軍官、都是以體育來作導火線、故德雖在歐戰受巨創、但各國猶畏之如虎、</p>
<p>英吉利丨丨英吉利目擊德意諸國民族性之日趨矯健、故亦覺悟軍事體育之迫切和需要、乃無日不在奮發圖進、惟略不如德意之完善、但英利用課外運動、給予高壓迫手叚、注意于青年體育和兒童運動、亦不遺餘力、</p>

<h3>尊賬</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>最是使人見着頭痛腦痛的，我想該輪到「尊賬」了吧。</p>
<p>米舖，柴店，都有「尊賬」，百貨商店，新裝公司、也有「尊賬」，眞麻煩，無法對付的「尊賬」。</p>
<p>德國在歐戰裏，欠下了恊約國的一筆大戰債，悉索散賦的分期拔還，一算得五十年，才能將那筆「尊賬」清訖。這可說一輩子做「尊賬」的奴隸了，於是乎整備着把「尊賬」投進火爐裡。可是對着德國索討「尊賬」的，大抵都是接得美國發來「尊賬」的，所以若是一旦德國眞把「尊賬」投進了火爐，美國雖打着燈籠到歡洲去，也很難在「尊賬」上打一下「清訖」的小戳子呢。</p>
<p>德國不理恊約國的索討「尊賬」倒也罷了，聽說還在那裡翻着舊賬簿，整備向法國發一下「尊賬」通知咧，眞好要子。而同時，俄國，也收到了幾張「尊賬」瞧吧，中東路的俄僞交涉中，不也曾一度喧傳着僞滿要求以紙羅卜做買路錢，而調查東北民間所存的舊俄紙幣麽。美俄復交的聲浪，喧總着好幾個年頭，到現在才正式復交，據說，美國要求俄國償還帝俄時代的舊債，也是一個重大的原因。可知一切糾紛，都是「尊賬」在那裡作祟。</p>
<p>我們中國也是對於「尊賬」皺眉的一個。最著名的是庚子賠欵，直賠到現在，還没有清訖的希望。還有一個是西原借欵，雖接到了「尊賬」通知，也不知如何對付。瀋變，據說是日本向我們收取二十一條的「尊賬」。但是在一二八裡，我們無端受到了這麽一個大損失，直到現在，還是無法投送這一個「尊賬」。在東四省，我們損失得更無可計數，這一筆「尊賬」，又該向誰清算呢？</p>
<h3>在圖書館裏</h3>
<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>每天，每天，趁着空的時間，我總要到本報流通圖書館去看書；一年來，這圖書館簡直成了我自家的藏書室。</p>
<p>站在電梯裏，慢慢兒升上去、司機的凖確地問：丨三樓，丨點了點頭，於是擦的一聲兒停啦。</p>
<p>走上幾步就到，於是我照例領了一塊藍底白字的閱覽證，打矮門裏進去。</p>
<p>在圖書館裏，簡直没有一個穿着漂亮的衣衫，也没有一個摩登女郎；埋着頭，二隻眼珠子注視在書本子上的，都是些負着生活重担的窮朋友。由此，可以更明瞭有多少没錢讀書而却要努力的人在呵？</p>
<p>很精緻的一方閱覽室塞了許多人，但空氣是那麽肅靜，和穆，保守着公共的道德，偶然提起幾個咳嗽聲，和沙沙的翻報紙聲。</p>
<p>要看的報紙，雜誌，都給捷手的佔去啦、只得托着下頷，眼光溜出窗去，望望對面精武體育會在起勁地打乒乓，望望天上一朶朶白雲，飄過蔚藍的天幔。等着，等着，一本新出的雜誌拿上手啦，於是靜靜地看，每個字飛到腦子裏去打個滾，一頁，一頁看下去；這樣比看那無意識的電影好得多了！</p>
<p>每天，每天，我是留戀在圖書館裏，但我可不知道自家的學識會有點進步？</p>
<h3>郎財女髦</h3>
<p>— 道盦</p>
<p>郎才女貌一個名詞已不適用於摩登化漸趨進步的今日。你看摩登女郎理想中的伴侣，那一個不注重金雖？摩登青年理想中的女友，那一個不注重時髦？換句話說，就是女子重財，男子重色。所以郎才女貌云者，現在應改爲郎財女髦，倒來得確切一點。如果你只懷着滿腹經綸無貝之才，而無麥克麥克的有貝之財的話，那末要想到美人的青睞；委實辦不到。女子們如果只生了一副娟秀的容貌，而没有五光十色的時髦裝束，未曾受過摩登洗禮的話，那裏可得到男子們的歡迎。</p>
<p>金錢是萬能的？所以意志薄弱，羨慕虚榮的女子，往往要受其誘惑，上鈎，其結果，勢必至於情塲失意：身敗名裂。但潔身自好的女子，金錢却不能動其心，利誘更不能變其志。</p>
<p>金錢又是萬惡的？可使你純潔高尚到的，以金錢買來的愛情，决不是眞愛情啊。</p>
<h3>小</h3>
<p>— 胡嚴文</p>
<p>小字含着一點侮蔑的意思，所以大人們駡孩子，開口就是。「小」鬼或者「小」傢伙，「小」畢三。</p>
<p>但是也不盡然：現代的女人，倘你和伊打趣，說伊將來要做公館裏的「小」夫人，那末，伊一定要柳眉倒豎，杏眼圓睜，咬着銀牙，駡你殺千刀；假使你一見面，就贊伊的身段嬌「小」玲瓏，像是個「小」天使，可愛的「小」鳥，那伊定會佯羞佯嗔，遥送你一個迷人的媚眼。竟說這不是稱心的報酬，西廂記上說：「怎當他臨去秋波那一轉！」這媚眼，會使你骨軟筋酥，比那駡你殺千刀，眞果歡憤各别了！</p>
<p>日本是蕞爾「小」島，以其渺乎其「小」也，所以我人都不把他放在心上；而日本乃利用其有點「小」聰明，努力邁進，終於佔得了列强國之一的地位。發兵奪了我們的東三省，恃其短「小」精悍之卒，扶助傀儡國成立，而地大兵多的中國，即以爲力量太「小」，不敢和這短「小」之軍抵抗。</p>
<p>被法國佔去的九島，「小」島也。我們的志向，健全有爲的體格，在金錢之神領導之下，不消磨得凈盡者幾希。然金錢：並不來引誘你：領導你：還不是你自已去指揮金錢嗎？</p>
<p>女色是萬能的？所以血氣未定的青年，經不得這搔首弄姿，嫵媚動人，有誘惑性的女色當前，不顚倒於旗袍角下，懇求伊見憐而垂青者，未之有也。</p>
<p>女色又是萬惡的？可使你百煉鋼，化爲繞指柔，更可使你中了催眠術似的，要東就東，要西就西：伊一開了口，除之天上的星拿不到外，其餘一切的一切，都可謹遵台命，件件辦到：又可使你入了迷魂陣似的迷迷糊糊，弄得一塌糊塗。然女色：却並不來迷惑你：引誘你：還不是你自已去誘惑伊們，崇拜伊們嗎？這呌做色不迷人人自迷。</p>
<p>女子的虚榮心，本來是很濃厚的，但是從虚榮中，要得到終身的幸福，恐怕成爲夢幻吧？</p>
<p>朝秦暮楚的男子們，不惜犧牲金錢和精神，竟與愛之神下了總動員令，衝鋒肉搏，赴湯蹈火，歷盡艱險。臨時完結，勢必至於敗北，說不定還要被對方迫訂城下之盟。所以要從胭脂隊中，得到心滿意足的賢内助，恐怕不能如願以償吧？</p>
<p>要知道眞正的愛情，非金錢所能買也以其渺乎其「小」，所以只在口頭上向人家爭兩句，人家因見我們「小」聲「小」氣，諒來幹不了什麽大事，所以置之不理，中國人的胆子太「小」，深怕和人家閙起來，自已要吃虧，便索性連「小」聲首都不響了！</p>
<p>中國人空掛着大字招牌，却都生得「小」眉，「小」眼，「小」心，「小」氣，所以弄得國家版圖日日縮「小」，在國際的地位，只好和那些殖民地的「小」國並列，哀哉中華，竟無大人！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>趙翁這些話，表面上是自已和自已解釋，其實也就是把這些話解釋給大家聽。桂枝在一旁看着，心想，像老太爺這樣賦性爽快的人，都這樣繞了灣子說話，這可以知道他那一番不得已，到了什麽情形。這就向趙翁笑道：我也是這樣說呀。一個人是幹什麽的，就得依了本分，跟着去幹什麽。家不算什麽，只要事情成就了，愛怎麽樣子舖張，家裏就能夠怎麽樣子熱閙的。這是我的心胸，究竟還算小啦。像黃小姐，人家可就是大心胸，有志氣的人了，什麽國家要亡，驉夫負責啦！趙翁聽了，不由哈哈在笑，黃曼英坐在椅子上，本來也就板住了面孔，低了頭不看人。這時聽到桂枝接連念了幾個别字，也就噗嗤一聲，笑了起來。趙翁笑道：我的大姑娘，國家要亡，這是多麽大的事情，草草的呌驉夫去負這個責任，這不是難事嗎？你要把這話去對趕驉子的去說，他眞可以說，干我屁事，我管不着。說到這裏，黃曼英又笑了。桂枝明知自已說錯了，應該害臊。可是想到難得趙翁和黃小姐這樣大笑：便道：喲！黃小姐，你不是這樣子告訴我的嗎？怎麽到我們口裏說出來，就招着你們這樣的哈哈大笑呢？黃曼英笑道：你打算呌趕驉的，怎麽着去負國家要亡的這個責任呢？江氏站在一邊，不知道他們閙些什麽玄　。可是看他們笑成了這個樣子，當然也是一種可笑的事情，自然也就附和着在一處笑了。因爲這樣一塲大笑，减少了大家不少愁悶，趙翁心裏愁着楊家母女不會快活的這一點，也就如釋重負了。（二四六）</p>
<p>社會寫真</p>
<h3>哭的種鋒號</h3>
<p>— 琢</p>
<p>朱𦐂先生寫了一篇「笑的總動員」，很有些幽默風味，在諸般的笑話中，彷彿聞到了個中人的哭聲，尤其難能可貴！小子嫌續貂之譏。塗成了一篇「哭的衝鋒號」，如果讀者在本篇中能够找尋出一些笑料，那是額外的贈品了。</p>
<p>哭上轎我們甬江風俗，嫁女人家當乾宅喜轎來。接新嫁娘時，做女兒的拜别了諸家長後，臨時上轎的當兒，一定要面對着母親哭一曲上轎歌。歌詞是現成的，鄕同流傳得很普遍，五六歲的小女孩就會曼聲學哭了；家長們聽了非特不加禁止，還嘖嘖稱讚道：「哭得好！阿囡眞乖？」伊們並不以爲不祥，越哭得傷心，越認爲大吉！將女兒家所以哭别的本意，完全失掉了。做女兒的在這一天，也儘量將練習了十餘年的上轎歌，一字一句的哭出聲來，務須諸親好友鄰居們來聆曲的人個個滿意而歸，那麽伊的一生，就得了好評了！</p>
<p>警察的權威三五輛黃包車，因爲攬不到顧客，車夫清閑地交义着脚膀，兩手吊在車槓上，逗留在大街的盡頭。這裏的崗警見到了，便走過來舉起了手裡的指揮棍，在車篷上一陣亂敲，頓時大家拉了車輛逃去了。最後一個車夫，措手不及，肩部着了一棍，拉了空車勉强逃了數步，想必痛不能忍，一失手，挽着的車槓就墮地了。警察誤會他不服自已的舉動，是負氣的表示，還追將過來就搶了一個車墊去，車夫照例哀求，跪拜，表演一齣中國的戲劇。警察因地位關係，始終佔着優勢，所以驕如天子，任你叩一百二十個響頭，呌一百二十一聲「警察老爺」一概充耳不聞！這時，恰巧一位穿中山裝的稽查到來，詢悉前情，大爲震怒！車夫褪去了上衣，肩上蘿菊般粗一條血痕，已暴露了出來，稽查見了更如火上添油，將警察老爺大加申掠。在警察隨身的調查日記簿上，寫了一行字，安慰了車夫幾句，命令交還了車墊，讓車夫拉了車子，含了眼涙走了纔動身。這時警察老爺的權威已剥削殆盡，恨恨地望着稽查的後影，呆着一張難畫難描的哭喪臉；這臉上就是表示着「大蠱吃小蟲」的人生了！</p>
<p>新婚之夜新婚之夜，新嫁娘泣甚哀。新郎心不忍，擬勸止之，忽然窘於詞。過了有一會，新娘哀泣如故，待了很久，新娘居然越哭越有勁了！新郎祇得鼓了勇氣道：「别哭，哭是很不利於身心的！而且不適宜於今天的」！新娘罔如不聞，依舊大泣。新郎躊躇了一會，又道：一别哭呀！你想起了你媽媽嗎？但是你得明白：你媽也不許你這樣哭呵！」新娘頓了一頓，重新又哭了。哭得新郎意興索然，負氣道：「别哭了，我最不喜歡人家哭的，你知道嗎？」新娘聽話，果然停止了哀泣，而且面上有了笑意，新郎倒覺得很詫異。無意中問起了原因，新娘作媚笑道：「阿母叮囑我的：你喜歡笑，我就要迎合你笑；你要我哭，我就得遵命大哭，早知你不喜歡哭，我也不掉涙了啊」！</p>

<h3>紗花標紗花仍帶軟勢</h3>
<p>紗市趨跌、形勢虚弱、以閩局風雲嚴重、福州厦門等帮受時局影響、對於貨物一律止辯、於是人心略受打擊、但近月被某會維持尚平、遠月在其範圍之外、市盤稍落、就大勢狀况測之、前途未許樂觀、</p>

<p>棉市又轉下游、美棉平平、而金價又敲破七百元大關矣、棉紗出路甚狹、廠方需要沉寂、日商亦屬觀低、故市上現棉售價不振、廉過期棉、因此人心欶化、就大勢論之、當有下降之虚、目前買方仍拉緊不放、市面尚堪維持、</p>

<h3>糧食晨疲午俏之粉麥</h3>
<p>粉市晨間開市前因洋麥報漲數角及一元不等、北銷活潑、市面尚在看好中、奈遭閩變影響、各方售出、市乃一再突落、近期小三分、遠小一二分、午後天津電報該地旺銷、價大至二元六角二分、在市繼續辦裝、人心又爲向上、各月份一致回升、尤以近期爲俏、故市價本月四月不動、十二月大一分二五、一二月各大半分、三月大七五、</p>
<p>麥市開市後承前日漲風、各月份一致有看好之必要、奈被閩變影響、囤買停手、多頭回出、市乃小大反小、但洋麥漲起一元及數角不等、而粉市又被天津帮辦裝而復漲、故午後麥市又見回升、結果一二月又漲各三分、三月大二分、十二月不動、本月四月收盤未開、三盤收市則十一月小三分、十二月二盤收市小四分、現麥廠銷貨乏、市乃步升、昨開宿州磘灣麥均至四元二角、損州高郵均四元一角、由申大信大辦去、</p>
<h3>客秈因閩變突落一角　甬帮趁小暢辦</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、晨間因福州事變、人心虚軟、閩省帮立卽停止辦裝、卽以前辦存者亦未付裝、該帮本有繼續暢辦之趨勢、因此政局變化　係、暫時難有暢胃之望、泉州帮　有胃口亦不敢儘量過問、布面疲落、價卽突落一角、繼有本街與甬帮趁小收買、甬帮胃口尤香、立卽辦成沙市糙二千包、價五元四角八分至五元三角八分、本街辦蕪湖機元二百七十四包、價八元二角七分至七元九角、又江西機元一百零八包價八元三角、泉州應酬無錫埠秈四百包、價七元一角半至七元一角云、</p>
<h3>晚稻包胃大動　續辦五千餘包</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源較前稍稀、到各帮船頭五十餘號、貨約六七千石、其中晚稻佔三十號左右、四五千石、北洋·天津·青島·烟臺等帮、包胃去路仍屬暢辦、五千餘包計六千餘石、因此售方乘機喊高形勢頓見轉緊、市况頗有生氣、但結果因　家吃盤難鬆、雙方相持不下、人混沌狀態、延至下午三時許、方始次第開出、面此時晚稻景象、已無多大樂觀、行情參差不一、祇有數分起色、且其西練塘特貨猶未就緒相持於六元八角左右、故預測明市未必似能勝色耳、其餘常帮·蘇同帮·南港等粳本街銷化與前相仿、惟售方見意於晚稻、因隨相繼扳高、略見秀色數分、杜羊尖無甚榮辱、隂元酒户續動、市形尚俏</p>
<p>滬南各路到船約十餘號、據來客云、因周家渡河道阻塞、致來源稀少、今銷胃略化、新粳高料疲勢、中次堅立、羊杜埠客尖白元隂元等平定之勢、早薄韜價小角許</p>
<h3>生仁突跌三角</h3>
<p>昨日生仁市况、因受閩局牽制、人心傾望之南洋銷路、從此稍受阻礙、故市場空氣突變、今日共成交開封貨三十噸、價開六元二角、較前日相跌三角之鉅、其他霖糧去路、亦稍露不振之象耳</p>
<h3>闡北貨北貨業受閩局影響　丨福州帮退貨止裝丨</h3>
<p>北貨業因受間局政變影響、福州帮日前辯定金針菜·木耳·線粉乾·紅棗等貨、紛紛向北貨行退還不裝、故市勢均有轉疲之傾向云、</p>
<h3>糖市新潮青開十五元半　色次不及陳貨</h3>
<p>昨日糖市稍現好勢、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨、初呌升至二十元二角、未成、後仍以一角半原價稍有劃出、荷赤八九號高貨十六元、次十五元七角至六角二分、無變動、太古糖Ｂ嘜二十元五角、ＣＷ嘜四角、ＤＹ嘜二角半、ＨＸ嘜一角半、中華國華振記本廠綿白仍開原價、新潮青以色澤不佳、以十五元五角成盤、陳潮青亦有開出、價爲十五元三角至一角、又十四元八角至七角半、</p>
<h3>五金青鉛售價跌一角</h3>
<p>青鉛昨日估盤每擔（天平秤）售十六元二角、比上日又跌一角、交易北路津青諸帮微有點綴、而福建生意、本懸浩大、近則受閩局變化　係、已呈停頓狀况、此外出路亦十分寥少、市勢不易樂觀也、</p>

<h3>現實的認識（下）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>但在屠絡湼夫從現實中捉取了這個「雛形」的時候，藝術家的屠格湼夫是在演着一個預言家的職務了，他能否使這個「雛形」生長起來，使預言家的他轉至藝術家的地位來，是完全看他的藝術的表現的，依我的觀察，屠格湼夫是作到這一步了。反過來講沙寗」的作者阿志巴綏夫，他也同樣是一個預言家，而他的預言是不正確的，當然，阿志巴綏夫，自已也以爲是從現實程捉取了一個類似「雛形」的東西，而才動筆的，但可惜他對於現實的認識是不正確的，他的沙寗無論如何是不會出現在「新時代」裏的，而且由預言家轉到藝術家來的阿志巴綏夫，他在才幹上更顯示出過多的缺欠，他的藝術的表現是比他的預言還不正確。因此「沙寗」，不管在其出版的當時曾是怎樣激怒了社會，它也是完全失敗了的東西。</p>
<p>我曾指明沙寗不是作者，是和作者完全相反的一個理想的人物，但在「沙寗」裏我們是可以看到作者的影子的，那便是那個受了敎育的惡害麻痺了一切的行爲的力，結果死於自殺了的青年猶里。他和沙寗的性格完全相反，沙寗是一個過份地强者，猶里是一個過份地弱者，可是他們兩個是同程度地不眞實。正如爲使沙寗成爲一個英雄，作者給與了他一件優越的條件，而同樣爲使猶里成爲一個無信仰無行爲的猶疑者，作者給了他一切卑屈的條件，作者不但處處暗示地嘲弄他，甚至在猶里的墓上，使沙寗說出這樣的話：「現在世界上又少了一個庸愚的人了！」像這樣和中國說部小說的製作法相似的「沙寗」，如何能夠成爲一部現實表現的藝術的書！</p>
<p>但縱退一步講，倘使「沙寗」的作者像「父與子」的作者同樣地捉取了現實的「雛形」的話，他的藝術表現法是能夠得到像屠格湼夫一樣地成功的麽？丨丨我可無疑地回答，那是絶對地没有可能性的。一個作家如果是取用了論文的說明的形式，只有現實的正確的認識，或是足夠的，至多再要文字的清順，但如果寫成並不是完全論理的小說，戲劇或詩歌，那就必要更多的藝術製作的才幹和勞力，而阿志巴綏夫在「沙寗」中所顯示的藝術，的確還缺欠得太多。在這短文裡，我只使讀者理解而同意於我的一點，是在說明現實的認識是和藝術的正確的表現有着絶對不可分離的聯索，像某先生那樣以爲只有前者便能完成藝術的製作的說話，無論如何是錯誤的。而且倘如一個作家縱有現實的正確的認識而無藝術的正確的表現，那就連他的認識的部份也將毁壞了。</p>
<h3>何謂選學？</h3>
<p>— 不典</p>
<p>選學妖孽，魔力猶弘，當代有名作家，亦有蒙其魅惑者，「自由談」已論之詳矣。</p>
<p>選學維何？吾人初不必發此愚問。但從文學史者之見地一論及之，固亦未爲不可。鄙人搬弄古事陳言，惜無「新智識」以供新人物汲取，是則所當引爲歉咎者也。</p>
<p>隋唐之際，有曹憲者，精諸家文字之學。自漢代杜林衛宏之後，古文泯絶，由憲此學復興。唐太宗嘗讀書有難字，字書所闕者錄以問憲，憲皆爲之音訓，及引證明白，太宗甚奇之。彼以野老百歲之高齡，膺皇帝之讀書顧問，其在當時，巍然一精於訓詁，富於字彚之學人也。所撰文選音義甚爲當時所重。初，江淮間爲文選學者，本之於憲。又有許淹李善公孫羅復相繼以文選敎授，由是其學大興於世。由是言之，選學始於隋唐之際，而盛於唐初，曹憲則此學之開山大師。杜公有詩云，續兒誦文選，又訓其子熟精文選理，蓋選學自成一家，終唐之世如此也。</p>
<p>五代之際，江南進士試「天雞弄和風」詩，以爾雅天雞有二，問於主司張佖，此亦精於選學者。故俗諺曰文選爛，秀才半。熙豐之後，士以穿鑿談經，而選學荒矣。蓋當以詩賦取士之世則選學爲盛，經義及八股取士之世則選學就衰。今亦有檜才大典，視其取士衡文之趨向，或亦可以卜選學之盛衰也。</p>
<h3>菊花</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>獨自個走到霞飛路上，站在一家花店的門前。</p>
<p>菊花已經盛放了。玻璃窗裏，陳列着各色的花種，粉白的，淡紫的，鵝黃的，墨綠的，在架上一行列的排着。使人瞧了，不自覺的發生一種美感。</p>
<p>每盆花的莖上都掛着一塊木牌。也不知道是那一個風雅之士，代牠們起的名字。什麽金鈎，蟹爪，夜來香，美人虹，東籬競爽，老圃秋容，從兩個字到四個字都有。可惜這些菊花在這兒是當做營業品的，掛上了木牌，反而覺得不稱在花中我最愛的是菊花。這愛倒不是像那些舊人物一樣，只單純爲了牠的色香味。而是因爲牠的那種傲然不屈的精神，很有些像一部分獻身於眞理的信仰至死不悔的人。而這些人，却是我所最敬愛的。</p>
<p>我站在花店門前，瞧着那些花。忽然想起了我的家，想起了我的書案，想起了書案前的窗檽上，還缺少一些點綴品。我開始有了一個意念，我想買兩盆花帶回家去。</p>
<p>經過了許多次的比較和選擇，我纔選定了一式的兩盆花，開了個地址，呌店裏人給我送過去。</p>
<p>從外面回家來，菊花已經先我送到，陳設在我案頭窗上了。淡紫色的花朶，傲然的挺立着，彷彿在向我　笑。</p>
<p>我默然的靜坐着，賞鑑那花的姿態。每天，我都有這樣一個靜境。這是我精神上享樂的時間。在這時間裏，我没有什麽企圖，没有什麽希望，甚至没有什麽迴憶。</p>
<p>我只想着一首詩。那日本詩人松尾芭蕉的名句：小蛙兒跳入蒼寂古池裏時池水的聲音。</p>
<p>但現在，我却不再想起那一首詩來，我只面對着那兩盆菊花。菊花，是和那詩一樣，富有着清趣。並且也同樣地能給予我　精神上以快樂。</p>
<p>「不嫌老圃秋容淡，惟愛黃花晚節香」我低低地這樣吟着，身心都覺着恬適。我着實有一些小布爾喬亞的氣分了。可是，現實的生活鞭子在鞭策着我，我終於不能常常享有那清福，我甚至連澆花和移動花盆的時間都没有。</p>
<p>每天晚上，把花盆移到庭心裏去受露水，早晨又把牠移進來，放在窗上。這些都是妻的工作。我只是一個現成的享受者。</p>
<p>妻也和我一樣，有着愛菊癖。雖然她的癖好，稍微有些和我不同。她只是單純爲看好玩而已。</p>
<p>有一天妻回母家去了。這菊花，便由我來照顧。</p>
<p>我在盆裏澆了些水，却忘了把盆移進庭心去。</p>
<p>當夜，我做了一個很奇怪的夢：好像我開始走進了一個菊花展覽會裏，忽然那菊花展覽會變成了一片廣大的刑塲，而那些菊花則都變成了受刑的人；恍惚這些受刑的人都是我熟識的朋友，又忽然起了斷續的槍聲。</p>
<p>我猛然的驚醒了轉來，天還没有大亮走到窗前去瞧時，兩盆菊花完全枯萎了。淡紫色的花瓣，散亂地落在盆裏，落在窗上，落在我案頭。那色彩，宛然似凝結了的鮮血。</p>
<p>我的心微跳着，我鄭重地把花瓣收拾起來，藏在一隻紙袋裏，携到庭心去，挖一個坑，把來埋葬了。</p>
<p>像一個慈母獻出她獨生的愛子一樣，我是以同樣虔誠的態度，做着我的埋葬的工作。</p>
<h3>文藝雜談</h3>
<p>— 夢原</p>
<p>病中無俚，讀胡適的「四十自述」，一個天神下凡的英雄的自傳。在「我怎樣到外國去」一章裏、他叙述了當時的中國公學的風潮，學生們爲自由而戰鬥的努力。他把這段原稿寄給當時的同學王敬芳先生，王覆書說，「我是當初反對取締規則最力的人，但是今日要　我取締規則到底對於中國學生有多大害處，我實在答應不出來。你是當時反對公學最力的人，看你這篇文章，今昔觀察也就不同的多了。我想青年人因感情的衝動，理智便被壓抑了，中國學校的風潮，大多數是由于這種原因。學校中少一分風潮，便多一分成就，盼望你注意矯正這種流弊。」胡博士接着在後面按道我是贊成這話的，但是我要補充一句：學校的風潮不完全由於青年人的理智被感情壓抑了，其中往往是因爲中年人和青年人同樣的失去了運用理智的能力。專責備青年人是不公允的。中國公學最近幾次的風潮都是好例了。</p>
<p>一個人的思想見解的轉變，在這裏是可以看到。胡博士的意思很明白，當初的爭自由，當時是覺得很有意思的，而現在看，却是「嘸啥道理」了。「健將」之一的王先生在事後追想，覺得這錯是在自已方面，那時的爭自由是不應該的，主張「少一分風潮，多一分成就」。「健將」之二的胡博士，除接受了他的意見外，却以爲專把買任要青年人負，結果還是有些「不妥當」，於是乎說，「中年人和青年人同樣的失去了運用理智的能力。」爲什麽我們的博士，對事件的認識，有這樣的轉變呢？我說，此胡適之所以爲胡適（此「胡適」應譯作「你到那裏去」）也。當初，胡博士等因風潮而退出中國公學，另立新中國公學，最後，因支持不下，在調解的掩護中，又復回到舊中公，雖然博士也覺得有點「難乎爲情」，寫着「應有天涯感，無忘城下盟」一類牢騷的詩句，但屈服與投降，終竟是屈服與投降。所以後來某將軍一面反對白話文，一面竟可以奉五千金爲「白話祖師」壽，胡博士年來的行動，在「有歷史癖與考據癖」的人們看來。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（三十六）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>羅蘭老爺抬起頭，在回憶中尋思着：</p>
<p>「等一等，我記不大清楚了。這事已經隔得這樣久，啊！對了我想到了。這是你母親在店裡認識他的，不是嗎，路易慈？他那時到店裡來定幾樣東西，隨後他便常常來。他起初祗是我們的顧客，以後才成爲朋友的。」</p>
<p>筆爾吃着一盆豆子，他用义尖一顆一顆地啄着、好像把豆子串在那上面似的，再說道：「這番交情是從什麽時候開始的呢？」</p>
<p>羅蘭又尋思着，可是一點都記不起來了，他求援於他女人的記憶道：</p>
<p>在那一年，我們想想看，路易慈？你一定没有忘記，你的記憶力那樣好。想想看，這是在…在…在千八百五十五年或五十六年罷？……喂，你想想看矌你一定比我記得清楚些。」她眞的想了一下，隨後以一種確實且安詳的聲音說道：</p>
<p>「這是在千八百五十八年。筆爾那時還祇三歲。我相信我没有記錯，因爲那年筆爾患着猩紅熱，那時瑪賴沙和我們的交情雖然還極淺，但却邦了我們很大的忙。」羅蘭呌說道：</p>
<p>「這是眞的，這是眞的，他那時簡直使人佩服。你的母親旣被你累得要命，我又要招呼店襄的生意，於是他到藥劑師那邊去給你配藥。這眞是一個有着好心眼的人。並且當你全愈的時候，你不知道他是怎樣的高興，怎樣的抱吻你來呢。我們便是從這時候成了好朋友的。」於是這突發的，猛烈的念頭，像一顆把人洞穿並裂開來的子彈一樣，竄進了筆爾的靈魂：「他旣然先認識我，這樣照顧遇我，他旣然喜歡我並那樣抱吻我，我旣然是他和我父母結交的原因，爲付麽他把他的財産完全遺給我的弟弟，而一點都不給我呢？」</p>
<p>他不再發問了，他現在悄然無語，與其說他在幻想着什麽，不如說他在埋頭考慮着什麽還貼切，在這沉默中，他保持着一個新的還不很明晰的罣慮，丨丨一種新的痛苦的秘密的根源。他很早便走了出去，又在街上閒蕩起來。街已被霧籠住了，霧使夜晚變得沉重，闇黑，呌人作嘔。這簡直像是一種傳染性的烟降落在地面。我們可以看得見這烟在煤氣燈前流過，煤氣燈有時彷彿被它弄熄了。街面舖着的石頭變得濕溜溜的，和結着冰的夜晚一樣，並且一切臭氣，丨地窖，洞穴，隂溝，貧苦的廚房等的惡臭，丨都像從那些家宅的肚襄出來埅混和在這飄流着的霧的惡臭裡似的。</p>
<p>筆爾彎着背，兩手放在袋裡，他不願在這樣寒冷的時候留在室外，他往瑪洛斯科家襄走去這老藥劑師老是在那代替自已看着店面的煤氣燈下打着磕睡。當他認出是筆爾，他以一種忠實的犬的愛情愛着的筆爾時，他連忙振作起來，跑去找了兩隻杯子並把覆盆子酒拿了來。「怎麽樣！你的甜酒推行到了甚麽地步？」醫生問。</p>

<h3>頽廢病的診斷和治療</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>狂風暴雨的時代，歐地荆棘的前途，於是，經過了一度或數度之人生的碰壁，許多青年就「病」了。如果病者眞是請敎醫院或掛牌的醫生，他口述的病情不外是；頭痛，腰痛，神經衰弱，四肢無力，精神不振，多夢，失眠等等；而醫生們所能帮助他的，又不過是爲他打幾劑補血補腦的針，呌他多吃些鷄蛋牛奶滿菜，呌他好好地「靜養靜養」可是，在另一方面，撇開了測騐體温，脈搏，血液和大小便等刻板的診察手續，我們從許多青年的生活方式中，發現很普遍之「深入腠理」而且略帶「傳染性」的病症。這種病之最合式的名稱，是「頽廢病或「浪漫病」。</p>
<p>姑且學一回眞正醫學博士或碩士們的當然手續，我在這裏也大胆對於青年之頽廢病的患者，做一番診斷，窮源和處方的工作。</p>
<p>首先，就病象而言，頽廢病有以下三種之特殊的徵候：一曰精神的歪洩，頽廢病的患者照例是不能把精神振作起來，但同時又不斷把精神消耗在「無病呻吟」的生活之中。這種人往往擺出一副「傷心人别有懷抱」之抑鬱幽怨的面孔，把悲秋惜春，哭花悼月的心情來適應一切客觀的自然界和人事問題，他最盼望的是「花常好，月常圓，人常壽，年常豐」，但事實的推演，却正是他的希望的反面。於是，他就悲不自勝了！男士們頽廢病者的主觀典型，是賈長沙，李長吉之流，女士們頽廢病者的主觀「模特兒」，是林黛玉！這種人常常像有國破家亡，茫茫身世之恫，但是對於東北四省之被割裂和帝國主義之大刀闊斧的進攻，却又是漠不關心。二曰官能的享樂，（浮生若夢，爲歡幾何」，是頽廢病者所一致欣欣樂道的口頭禪：「醇酒婦人，惟恐不及」，是大部分頽廢病者所實踐的生活方式。他如到「轉台」上狂賭一番，到跳舞廳去跳到「不知東方之旣白」，買一塊錢的「雲膏」來抽他一個發昏，以及各種以換取神經和官能之一時三刻或一刹那問的麻醉剌激爲目的之享樂方式，在每一頽廢病者的生活中，都有任一方面或「全能」的「樂此不疲」。三曰「不管明天」和對於一切都不滿意，自我麻醉和官能享樂的本身，就是「不管明天」的第二步推演，「今期有酒今朝醉」，「今夕只可談風月」，更是許多頽廢者在「樂以忘憂」時所常唸的「僻邪神咒」。其次，頽廢病者差不多對於一切事態，都取否定或「嗤之以鼻」的態度。例如：自已雖是正被性的饑渴所襲擊，但一見别人在談戀愛，就道貌岸然地斥之爲「獸慾的衝動」：見到人家在找職業，就加以挖苦「生活的奴隸」；談到政治，就不分皂白，一概斥爲「率獸食人」；談到政黨，他的意見就是：「黨」字「尚」「黑」，那裏會有好的？談到抗日反帝，又認爲是「自已想出風頭」或「被人利用」。總之，萬事　物，在頽廢病者的眼光中，都是「昏蛋」，「糟糕」。然而頽廢者自已，却又從來不肯把「不昏蛋」，「不糟糕」的事想一點，說一點或做一點出來！頽廢病的患者無往而不尋求麻醉和剌激，但麻醉和剌激始終只能爲他掩蔽現實於一時，結果在　啡性消失的時候，他仍然不便受現實壓迫之殘酷的鞭撻。所以，頽　病的本身，就是一種慢性的自殺，而且頽廢病之突然的劇變，往往演成兌現的自殺。</p>
<p>次之，我們對於頽廢病加以窮源。客觀的原因，自然是半殖民地社會經濟之與日俱深的破産和整個中國之長期的動亂不安現實，給與青年之碰釘子的機會太多了。主觀的原因，就是頽廢病患者的本身，對於人生社會諸問題認識的不夠和缺乏把握現實，艱苦奮鬥的勇氣。</p>
<p>最後，我得替患頽廢病的朋友們開一個「自療」的「方子」：</p>
<p>一，把一切無病而呻的精神和「才人（或「紅顔」）薄命」的感歎都用在分析問題並處理問題之上，根本要認清，在這你認爲無聊的世界上，你大半還是要繼續生活下去，旣然要生活，就必須把生活弄得更豐富而合理一些。</p>
<p>二，就個人日常生活講，必須弄得非常之緊張而有條理，就人與人的關係講，必須使自已多與羣衆接觸，由單調而成爲集體化或羣衆化。因爲頽廢病之中人甚深，往往是從生活的「有閑」和孤獨而來的。</p>
<p>三，放開眼光，認識你所處的時代和環境，從唯物的世界觀和社會觀中，樹立你自已之戰鬥的人生觀。</p>
<p>這世界根本就没有過剩的米糧麫包來豢養許多頽廢或没蓄份子。所以，我奉勸一切頽廢派：「快快回頭！」</p>
<h3>厠所中</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>厠所是個呌人不大高興的地方，可是你得時時去接近牠。當一個人光臨到厠所中的時候，誠然很無聊，比不及進戲院上菜館那麽興致勃勃；但一種優閒自在的態度，也頗夠人神爽。我們終日爲了生活，爲了事業，忙得不可開交；一踏入厠所中，則身心輕鬆了大半，立刻可以得到幾分鐘安逸的辰光。或口含香烟一支，徐徐地一吞一吐，凝神地注視着眼前變化萬千的烟圈。或雙手托住腦袋，細細地咀嚼着已往甜蜜的餘味。到這境地，任憑你是個怎楺不快樂的人，也得把人間的一切痛苦，暫時抛掉。</p>
<p>如果你肯留心靜觀一下，在厠所中，我們就隨時可以發見許多光怪陸離的景象，使你嘴角上會要浮上微笑。藝術品是很常鑑賞到的。絶簡單幾筆搆成的一隻烏龜，或是三五個鬼形怪狀的人物像，及一類什麽「人在客中心在家」的粗俗句子，這便是幾位無名畫家詩人的傑作。「阿木是拘養的」，「阿呆吃米田共」，四面的粉壁，又成爲小朋友互相攻駡的揭示板，眞是美不勝收，趣味無窮！不但此也，近幾年來，厠所中又一變而爲寫標語的塲地。主義的競爭，竟爭到厠所中，好不奇特！什廠「打倒××黨」，××主義萬歲」，「擁護××政府」，這類的標語，觸目皆是。這又是一班無名革命運動家努力的成績。這些形形式式，都可以抓來做爲我們消耗時光的好玩意。</p>
<p>至若一輩好學的書痴子，還可以利用上厠的時間，大做其工夫；手執一卷，聚精會神地一個字一個字讀下去。這也是焚膏繼晷的一法，獲益當亦不少。聽說有幾位著名的中外學者，他們的學問，有一部分便是由厠所中得來的。</p>
<p>有些人在厠所中一逢到熟識的朋友，大家就得高談闊諭起來。在這裏談話的題材是很隨便很廣泛的，有時從拉水說起，一直說到吃飯戀愛政治國際生死等問題上去。</p>
<p>又有一種人，在厠所中竟能大睡其　。但這很危險，一跌落下去，郵可不是玩的啊！</p>

<h3>虚榮的後面</h3>
<p>— 小鶯</p>
<p>據說，鎭江焦山曾有和尚分析人間的奔波，認爲動機在名和利，而二者是平行的分道揚鑣。但是，如果要再追究人們求名的動機，今世已無餓死首陽山的夷齊，所謂名公鉅卿，古道熱腸，誰又敢說不是上下交征利。</p>
<p>際雲先生昨日在本刊論虚榮心，將舉世罪惡，盡集於虚榮；以爲世人果不抱虚榮心，注意實惠功利，便得天下太平。但是，這也許太樂觀了吧！世人多是布衣素食，而行動仍是那麽一套的追求自私自利，除去增多一批一毛不拔的眞小人以外，祇除去了僞君子，又與世何益？</p>
<p>自然，際雲先生的前提是這樣的；因爲好虚榮，所以開支耗費大；因爲開支耗費大，於是作奸犯科而歛財，以致自害害人，假如再進一步來問，爲什麽要好虚榮呢？那决不是祇因爲要驕其妻妾，或是坐黑牌子汽車看行人，動機所在，還不是反果爲因，正就爲的作奸犯科。告訴際雲先生吧！作奸商的絶不是受虚榮心的驅使，而奸商們却拚命追求一紙空頭的委員頭銜之虚榮者，倒實在是要藉一些所謂社會地位來掩誰自已而已！</p>
<p>人爲萬物之靈，尤其是在所謂壞的一方面，一舉一動，一顰一笑，在這商品化的現實社會階段中，調情賣弄，并不限於被人卑視的妓女，甚至可說誰都妓女化了。處世哲學中所謂「見人說人話，見鬼說話，」還不是樽畔淺笑的意味兒麽？</p>
<p>作者并不是一個所謂嫉世的悲觀論者，但却要拆穿革心改良社會的過分樂觀態度，所以認爲新勸世篇的呌人莫存虚榮心，而不明白虚榮心的後面是什麽，乃是一件徒勞無功的事。這是必然的事實，我們對聞人去說敎儉的，和對老虎去說敎莫殺生一般的没有結果，也許他們還會笑你太幼稚呢！「予豈好虚榮哉，予不得已也！」這句話倒也是一點實情。</p>
<p>在這個年頭兒，絶再不能夢遊桃花源，誰不能拿出不爲五斗米而折腰的皮氣，米又不能如空氣一般可以愈取愈求，你雖然我行我素，人家却是祇認衣冠不認人，道無術而不行，虚榮早被視爲偉大的術科了。</p>
<p>我反對虚榮，絶不會提倡虚榮，但是，明白了虚榮的後面，才知道捨本就末，不祇是不能卸除虚榮，而且會給你碰壁的。講一句時髦話，這和根本問題是有關係的。</p>
<h3>求仁得仁，又何怨乎」？</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>中國自古對於英雄義士的悲慘下場，總時常給以讚譽的論調，然而我却不解。</p>
<p>如太史公伯夷列傳曰：「伯夷叔齊，孤竹君之二子也，父欲立叔齊。及父卒，叔齊讓伯夷，伯夷曰，父命也，遂逃去。叔齊亦不肯立而逃之，國人立其中子。於是伯夷叔齊聞西伯昌善養老，盡往歸焉。及至，西伯卒，武王載木主號爲文王，東代紂。伯夷叔齊叩馬而諫曰：父死不葬，爰及干戈，可謂孝乎？以臣弑君，可謂仁乎？…武王已平殷亂，天下宗周，而伯夷叔齊恥之，義不食周粟，隱於首陽山，采薇而食，及餓且死」。讀了這一段，至少是令人憤慨嘆伯夷叔齊的死得寃苦，好好的皇帝不當，逃走去投一個不見高明的武王，終至餓死。但是「仁義自居」的孔子遂大大加以褒美：「伯夷叔齊，不念舊惡，怨是用希，求仁得仁，又何怨乎」？這話出自周遊列國有如目前的「民族英雄」「名人」「碩士」處處有人開歡迎會捐助的孔子口中，我就覺得他是極端的風凉而且冷酷！</p>
<p>正如孔老二的「仁義道德」至今還能支配人心認爲中華的「民族性」一樣，他的風凉與冷酷的態度，也保持到了現在。江民聲與敵人血戰經年，而今得操拭爲之業，梁桐芳以一抗日軍領袖，竟與人代步爲生，抵抗者如此，而不抵抗者復如彼，任如何是使人慨嘆了，然而有人譽爲「光榮的下場」，「自食其力」的「英雄本色」，這與冬天坐在電爐旁邊從窗裏看着馬路上寒風中掙扎着的勞動者，而讚美他們有「耐苦精神」有同樣的寓意。</p>
<p>可是話又說回來，這樣說并非認「抗日英雄」必得作總司令總司令總指揮或者主席，且必須如此而後快。伯夷叔齊重禮讓而輕「九五」，自有其「求仁得仁」之意用不着非議，但是有「居仁不讓」如梟雄劉備奪西川者流在，就覺得伯夷叔齊過儍而不應該；武王代紂眞個是「以暴易暴」，結果以義不食周粟餓死首陽來抵抗，這一消極態度，更是罪惡。東北義勇軍起時，從募捐隊後援會直到幾十萬的「毁家輸難」止，集腋成裘頗不在少數，然而、救國善士」「名歸」而又「實至」者大有其人。這本來像交易所投機買賣一樣。江民聲梁桐芳那時或許不懂這點，以致「日暮途窮」，不得在「抗日功成」之後到西歐遊歷一趟，在萬衆歡迎之下回國尋山訪勝，就足見到其不怎樣聰明。聰明人見着儍子，是會說他「忠勇可嘉」的，所以在「抗日」交易所發了横財的人，就們着自已滿滿的腰包，對江民聲梁桐芳彷「求仁得仁又何怨乎」的口吻說着表面贊譽實則風凉冷酷的話：「天下興亡，匹夫有責，國有難，挺身作干城，患即除，解甲歸畎畝，擦皮鞋，職業也，拉車，職業也，勞工神聖，何辱之有，不居功，不干祿，這才是英雄本色」。患是否已除，這大可懷疑，「天下興亡匹夫有責」的行動是否被人當成物品在「抗日」交易所出路，尤得仔細，至於說不干祿不居功是英雄本色，那江梁二氏看見目前國境日蹙反而大談親善的情形，就須有隱於首陽采薇而食爲最「清高」！然而又太儍了。</p>
<p>在此一切都已商品化的現社會，愛國「抗日」等的「英雄」事業竟也逃不出這個定律，直到現在還閙着的種種名目的救國，就可看出這一表徵來。許多眞正「天下興亡匹夫有責」的人，就在這一形式下被出賣。一些「名歸」而又「實至」的「英雄」，就以冠冕堂皇「人格清高」來贊譽儍瓜，鼓其雌簧之舌。對的，爲的免得一般人趨於「憤慨」，義不食周粟餓死首陽的人愈多愈好，可是中國這樣的人却少，於是贊美儍子「忠勇可嘉」的說話正用得着。江民聲梁桐芳畢竟是英雄本色，「求仁得仁又何怨乎」？</p>
<p>然而我覺得是極度的風凉與冷酷。</p>

<h3>童年斷片的回憶（十）</h3>
<p>— 烈火</p>
<p>挨過了一刻鐘的光景，畢究我是愁容滿面地去到了牛欄前，對着一頭十分雄大的金黃色的黃牛出神，媽媽看見還没有出發的動靜，急忙趕上前來；「太陽已經出山了，你還不牽着牛兒去，好孩子，聽話些，去吧！回來時給你一盌蛋炒飯，四哥放牛時是没有這種福氣的，快走吧！」媽媽說了一大清早的話，抵不過「回來時給你一盌蛋炒飯」一句的動聽，我慌了，忽然他在塘底那邊現出了半個頭蓋，不由得我大笑起來，於是他又在塘底中央划了幾個圈，便呌我下水，我便下了水：隨即他敎了我幾套划水的姿式：「口要閉住，頭要俯下，用力要匀緩，」講好，我便俯下身子去試，果然成績不壞，雖然頭幾次不免有些慌張，吃力，划不上十分遠。但一連練習了好幾個下午，手脚便也純熟了，覆浮固然是學會了，就是翻浮也學會了：並且覺得這種浮法更省力，一口氣便能划過十來丈遠的直徑的塘了。只是泅水還不行，在水裏我過不了一分鐘便要衝出頭來，覺得氣悶得很。</p>
<p>因爲每天下午都要泅水，便把牛繩縛在樹幹上，使黃牛繞了樹兒兜圈，没有遠走的自由，省得吃了人家菜園裏底菜，或田裏底稻，招起禍來。</p>
<p>這消息，幾日以後，傳進了媽媽底耳朶，爸爸也知道了。</p>
<p>「你這野崽子，聽說你幾日以來，都在塘裏泅水，溺死了例不打緊，苦了肥肥的一頭牛，給你又餓得怪瘦的了，你這野崽子！」爸爸怒視着駡；幸虧還未動手打。</p>
<p>「呌你不要去玩水，你偏瞞了我去，溺死了，看怎樣辦！賀瞎子說你在七月裏要特别當心！」媽媽在慈祥的笑容裏只如此地說了兩句；</p>
<p>第二天我睡到茶時（註八）才起床，知道放牛的工作，又轉給四哥去了。</p>
<p>一九三一，六，一○，在江灣，</p>
<p>（註一）是一種治肚痛的藥品，（註二）就是說先天的體質，（註三）看不見的意思，（註四）係松樹葉的土名，（註五）喻人無成就的土話，（註六）指普通的家信而言，（註八）鄕村社會没有鐘表，僅知到了上午九時，下午三時的時候，說是喝茶的時候到了，所以便稱該時爲茶時，上午十一點鐘的時候，稱爲酒時。（註七）長年係指做長工者而言。（完）</p>

<h3>關於「建設的批評」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>讀十六日劉化南君的「敬致電影批評家」一文，使我個人感覺自已責任的重大。自已旣然是常常寫些電影批評的人，少不了自認對中國電影發生了密切關係，然而因着自已的淺薄，時常自信不能盡職，現在有劉君提出了如此重大的要求，更使我個人覺着無限的惶悚。</p>
<p>對於劉君　提出的「建設的批評」，我以爲寫電影批評的朋友們應當承認這問題之正確。無論如何，批評者本身即是電影的研究者，因此批評者和作者之間，正該相互的不這餘力的以求中國電影之進步。同時，批評者也負有將影片的一切忠誠的介紹給觀衆的責任，這不僅是指導觀衆如何去鑒賞藝術而已，而且要使觀衆知道作者創作的企圖。特别是就前者而言，觀衆對於電影創作的方法或技巧，更是十分迫切的需要知道的吧。</p>
<p>所以我個人在接受劉君的建議之餘，更有如上所述的補充。所謂「建設的批評」，不獨是帮助中國電影的作者，而同時也是帮助中國的電影觀衆。尤其是在一般觀衆的理解力過於薄弱的當前，凡從事電影文化的人們，莫不引爲深憂，因此，建設的批評，在這一方面更有其重大的意義。</p>
<p>現在具體的提出下列各點意見，使這一提議得以實踐。</p>
<p>由本刊編者特約專家若干人，在每一新片一般的批判之外，更將某一影片的某一部份，提出來大家研究。譬如說大家都承認「春蠶」的劇的成分太少，這當然的劇作者的失敗，那末我們便不妨在劇本方面加以詳細的探討。同樣，我們承認「慈母恨」或是「絶塞情鴻」的導演是非常好的，我們也可從事縝密的研究。他如「蠟像陳列所之秘密」的化妝，「金山」的表演，「大飯店」的置景，或是其他某些影片之中的攝景，錄音等，都是我們研究的材料，當然我們所探討的不必全是中國片，然而主要的還以中國片爲對象。同時我們也不必只限旣成的影片，甚至對於將攝製而未着手的，我們也可以在一番研之後而向作者提出意見。譬如我們爲聯星公司改編「怒吼罷，中國！」設計，我想一定是他們樂於接受的罷。其他如「三友式」錄音機在試騐期中，我們也可以因之而在學理方面來一次研究。</p>
<p>這對於電影作者固然大有裨益，而在讀者方面，一定也感覺興趣，在不知不覺的中間提高了鑒賞的水凖。特别是外國電影並没有中國版，對於觀衆隔膜太深，假便我們能將某些影片的對話翻譯出來，也不是寃枉的事。何况全般介紹名片的劇本，更有其相當之價值。</p>
<p>以上敬獻於本刊編者並告從事電影文化的人們。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「龍馬精神」ＧreatDecision</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>丨雷電華出品·南京闋映丨</p>
<p>這個故事發生在美國鄕村中，導演對於鄕村的描畫，總算很好的盡了責任。</p>
<p>鄕村的和平，在一家小店中，由於每一個人嘻笑的姿態上縈繞着。雖然他們都受着强盜的侵擾，可是大家都還鎭靜的和平。然而這裏所寫的並不像「桃花源」那般無理由的將鄕村美化起來，可喜的是眞實的把握住質樸的氣氛。</p>
<p>這裏有飽經世故的老人、有忠直的青年，有温情的少女。……我們從老人焚燒了手中在烤着的食物，青年將所有的錢幣買了一個麵包，再從老人手裏接收那盒烟草，少年情人談着那牛乳瓶等塲合，都證明作者是極力的顯示他的聰明。</p>
<p>不過一般的說起來，到底是平庸的作品。我們雖然看着作者相當細膩的處理劇情，然而對於兩次高潮的把握，都不夠力量。當强盜逼湯尼爲盜，湯尼死於盜手，及至妻子兒女見屍大働的時候，在我們想像中一定非常悲慘，可是事實上這幾個鏡頭，却失敗了。這固然是那個飾母親的過於平庸，而導演却也無法補救。此外最後的一個高潮，雖然因着叢密的槍聲使空氣緊張起來，然而老人和青年，始終於處之泰然，過於誇大了的所謂沉着應戰，這樣一來，却使觀衆對畫面發生不眞切之感。</p>
<p>這一塲合，固然導演要負最大的責任，然而那兩個飾老人和青年的角色，也没有補救這種缺點。飾老人的ＣharlesSale，在「生意經」中有着極好的成績，那種詼諧而活潑的表演技巧，使我們永遠不會忘懷。但在這裏我們却見他極力表現出老邁的英雄模樣，這是不易於擔當的工作，於是不像「生意經」那般的討好我們了。ＢillBoyd有着「黨人魂」的英名，到後來在「畫舫情痕」中也顯出粗線條的英俊之氣。但在這裏却一點也不見特殊精采，充其量不過是盡職而已，和一般的平庸角色並無二樣。</p>
<p>平庸的演出，自然是平庸的故事所决定。在這裏因爲要寫鄕村被刦，於是必然的要創作一羣强盜。而這羣强盜也就是天生的惡人。因此使我們想起「鐵板紅涙錄」的說明士匪是因着「官逼民變」而産生，的確是作者把握了經濟機構而後指出的了。至於這一作品中的愛情穿揷，却很純樸的使人有眞切之感。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「蠻荒之花」我觀</h3>
<p>— 寅仲</p>
<p>在外國「野獸片」之出現，是含有特殊重大的意義的，是藉以作征服野蠻民族，擴張他們的殖民地的宣傳工具。但「野獸片」之出在我國的，自不同其意義，且亦並無何等意義存乎其中，而我國的一般觀衆的怠識裏，也不了解它的意義，他們只要「好白相」是了，在這等現象之下，外國獸片之被熱烈歡迎，自不待言，而國産獸片，也就是利用了這一點而産生的。</p>
<p>但是新近開映的「蠻荒之花」，這張國産獸片的内容與技巧，究竟是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>先談它的内容。它是寫一對未婚的青年男女，往菲洲去旅行，在那邊遇到可怕的猛獸，與之搏鬥。這不用說，當然是假的。事實上，我國人連自已的蒙古西藏新疆等一帶邊僻之地，都不敢過去，那裏敢老遠地跑到外國有毒蛇猛獸的菲洲去呢？</p>
<p>我們知道「野獸片」是多少帶些新聞性的眞實的，它不比其他各片之可用人工製造的。然則這片子裏的菲洲背景是從那兒來的呢？那不用說，又是從外國片上抄襲而來。所以這片子之完成，只是靠剪接的工夫的。可惜這剪接的工夫太不高妙，因此内中不免露出馬脚來，這是導演者應負其責的。</p>
<p>說到演出，兩位男女主角的表演工夫，都很可取。比之以前的「荒島野人」一片，好得多了。「下略」</p>
<h3>「蠻荒之花」我見</h3>
<p>— 愼工</p>
<p>被外國的獸片侵占着的上海電影市場，居然有了這一部「蠻荒之花」的國産的獸片，無論如何，這是值得爲競爭的一點上吐一口氣的。</p>
<p>獸片雖然是爲了一般好奇的觀衆所攝製的，但是好的獸片亦很能顯示攝片工程上的不易，和技術的能力，如「人猿泰山」，「龍虎鬥」等片都能夠觀衆以相當的滿足。</p>
<p>海而他們有的是資本，到菲洲去拍攝各種怪默，以作銀幕上的資料，我們苦於資本不足，於是便只好東併西凑起來，意識上的價值，固不必論，就是技術上，又有什麽意義呢？祇不過顯出了巧妙的剪接手段而已！</p>
<p>題材上因爲要適合片中的情節，不免有牽强之處。菲洲是不是世界上的名勝，爲什麽要去旅行？這根本莫明其妙。蠻王好像同文明的人一樣，很知道仁義，亦不成其爲蠻王了。</p>
<p>獅子和老虎在以前許多外國片中，早已使一般好奇心重的觀衆們看得厭倦了，當然不能引起若何興味。至於殺死一條蛇的場面，在克萊拉寶的「野性」ＣallHerSavage一片中所見到的，比較可怕得多了，但在「蠻荒之花」這一片中，能夠支持逼眞的塲面，確是很不容易，而可以算是成功的一段了。</p>
<p>導演的佈置有些地方比較欠缺，有些地方尚可以。至於菲洲的風光，根本是别人家的技巧，當然很能使人稱可。演員中，以賀志剛最純熟，很能稱職。徐素貞亦不差。其餘諸演員也能使人滿意。尤其是幾個恐怖鏡頭上所表演的很逼眞。</p>
<h3>湯曉丹候補新郎</h3>
<p>爲了李鄖的婚事，引起了天一公司中人的婚嫁談，而這一回被請爲男嬪相的余光，湯曉丹，和女嬪相的陸麗霞，胡姗四個人，更無形中成爲談話的中心。據說；余光是早已結了婚的，而陸麗霞也早已屬諸王春元。胡姗的不曉得，我們祇知道老湯還是一隻童子雞。所以大家下一次的喜酒預約單上，都寫上曉丹的名字，但，老湯的對象爲誰？吉期何日？誰也不能說個正着。因之，湯曉丹便成爲一個候補新郎了。</p>
<h3>電影小說香草美人（一）</h3>

<p>明星影片公司出品陳鏗然導演馬文源編劇演員丨以出塲前後爲次：謝雲卿夏佩珍王徵信譚志遠顧蘭君徐莘園蕭英嚴工上（一）楔子</p>
<p>據說上海是「萬惡的淵藪」。社會的畸形的制度不斷地製造出許多犯罪的人，却另外用一種呌做法律的東西來收拾他們。</p>
<p>法院裏天天都是那麽熱閙的：一批又一批跑進許多罪犯。於是審問：爲什麽要犯罪？然後請「刑法」的醫生來治犯罪」的病。爲什麽要犯罪呀？我們看一個人的犯罪的經過吧！他是千千萬萬的罪犯中的一個：他的名字呌做王阿大。</p>
<p>（二）生活的福音</p>
<p>在大中華香烟公司的工塲裘，有一大羣爲了生活在那裏忙碌着的人。錚，錚，錚！用勁釘着木箱：好像他們的生存祇是爲釘木箱而來的。</p>
<p>緊張的空氣有點兒動盪了，一個工頭在說話：「公司的第二分廠已經成立了，要添用二千多男女工人呢；你們有親戚朋友，可以介紹他們來呀！」</p>
<p>這消息散播在各人的心裏，激起了一個喜悅的浪花。王阿大想到了他在鄕間的老婆女兒和年青的弟弟，他的心也動了。這麽着，他就向管理處替她們登記了。</p>
<p>事情是那麽順利而且僥倖，王阿大一家的生活就這樣輕易地得了解决。老婆在裝盒間，女兒在揀葉間·兄弟在貨棧推運大筒烟葉，他有牛一般的力氣。</p>
<p>高嗇，大烟突，鍋爐間的煤和火，調烟間隆隆的機輪，切葉間的刀，捲烟間的千百隻貧血的手……王阿大一家在這樣的生活環境裏過着日子，可是他們很滿意。白天忙碌着，晚上恬適地睡去，有時候從夢裏笑醒。</p>
<p>十幾塊錢一個月的一樓一底的房子是租進來了。雖然辛苦，每天肚子都是飽的。這麽平安地過了一年。</p>
<p>（三）殘燈</p>
<p>小街，亂嘈嘈的氣氛。上面寫着「請吸國貨香烟，大中華香烟公司出品，買一盒送一盒」的小旗子東風裏飄呀飄的。</p>

<h3>Government Orders Strict Suppression of the Fujian Rebellion; Orders the Executive Yuan and Military Council to Instruct Subordinate Agencies to Swiftly Handle the Situation; Central Executive Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss Response Measures, to be Submitted to Today's Central Political Council for Discussion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council has scheduled its 385th meeting for the morning of the 22nd to discuss measures to address the Fujian Incident. Notifications were issued tonight. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 21st to the Executive Yuan and the Military Council, stating: "Regarding the order for instructions, since the outbreak of national crisis, the entire nation has united to seek solidarity in order to save the country from peril. Recently, the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi has been consistently victorious, and complete elimination is expected. All construction can then commence, and the undertaking of revival hinges on this critical moment. However, Chen Mingshu and others have suddenly taken this opportunity in Fuzhou to gather so-called important members of the Third Party, establishing their own banner and engaging in rebellion. At the same time, they collude with communist bandits, assisting their rampage, fabricating rumors, and unjustly slandering the government in order to confuse public opinion. If their audacity is allowed to continue, it will poison the lives of the people and endanger the country, creating a calamity beyond imagination. Therefore, it is ordered that the Executive Yuan, in conjunction with the Military Council, instruct subordinate military and political organs to swiftly handle the situation, ensuring the early suppression of the rebellion. Furthermore, local governments and garrisoned troops are instructed to maintain strict vigilance, eliminate the source of the trouble, so that the foundation of the nation is not shaken, and the grand strategy of national salvation and survival can be continued and implemented. In addition to separate orders, this joint order is issued for compliance. This order." (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The above order was delivered to the Executive Yuan and the Military Council at 9 a.m. on the 21st. Premier Wang immediately added instructions to the original order, directing the two military departments and the provincial and municipal governments to cooperate with the garrisoned troops for thorough prevention. He then presented a report at the Executive Yuan meeting and, at noon, instructed the Secretariat to forward the order to the relevant agencies for compliance. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee convened a meeting on the 21st to study the steps for handling the Fujian Incident in order to submit them to the Central Political Council for discussion on the 22nd. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, and others. Tang Youren also participated. The regular meeting for the 22nd will still be the 385th session, continuing discussions on the Fujian issue. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Premier Wang's Remarks on the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang stated, "The Fujian Incident is a joint attack by the Third Party and the Communist Party against our party. This is different from previous internal party disputes. All comrades should stand on the position of our party's ideology and fight together. As for the people of the whole country, if they witness the extreme cruelty and misery of the bandit areas, they will surely rise up and assist our party to advance bravely and save the people of Fujian from the abyss of suffering." (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government Strictly Orders Prevention of Reactionary Activities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, the situation has become slightly tense. The Central Government is deeply concerned that troublemakers may use various pretexts to disrupt public peace and order and undermine social stability. It is reported that strict orders have been issued to military and police agencies in Beijing, Shanghai, and along the Pinghan Railway to maintain strict vigilance. Regardless of their stated reasons, any behavior that oversteps the bounds will be dealt with severely according to the law, without leniency. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Office Continues to Operate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Fujian Incident, the Beijing office of the 19th Route Army is still operating as usual. Its负责人 states that after reading the newspaper and seeing that the People's Government had been established in Fujian Province, they had not received any telegrams from the army in Fujian in the last three days. However, telegrams between Beijing and Fujian have not been disrupted. Telegrams sent by this office are still being received and dispatched by the telegraph office. As for the actual situation, personnel in the office find it difficult to respond to inquiries from various parties because Huang Hechun has not sent any letters or telegrams since going to Fujian. In short, this office is a subordinate agency for forwarding communications, and has no access to important confidential matters. The Central Government has not indicated its attitude towards this office. We can only wait for the natural course of events. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Malaya Support the Central Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Overseas Chinese organizations in Malaya have telegraphed the authorities in Fujian and Guangdong regarding the rebellion of Chen Mingshu and others in Fujian, expressing their support for the Central Government for the benefit of the party and the nation. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beijing Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Urging Jiang, Cai, etc.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) More than 40 professional organizations, including the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, stated that Chen Mingshu and others have colluded with the Third Party, established a government in Fujian, promoted the drug-like policy of accommodating communists and distributing land, and are betraying the party and the nation. They specifically telegraphed Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and others on the 21st, urging them to share the difficulties of the time, not to be held hostage by these people, not to violate their oath not to participate in civil war, and to maintain the honor of resisting Japan in Shanghai. They also urged them to immediately dissolve the puppet organization and execute all traitors who harm the country in order to set the world straight. If they hesitate and listen to their instigations, the citizens of Beijing will lead a unified denunciation across the country to eliminate the national traitors and ensure the safety of the people. (21st Central Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yunnan, Hunan, and Guizhou Not Participating in the Fujian Affair</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Tianpei, the representative of Yunnan stationed in Beijing, said that Chairman Long of Yunnan Province has always cherished the party and the nation and supported the Central Government. He will never participate in any unconscious movement that would only increase the country's difficulties and become a laughingstock for foreign countries. Chairman He of Hunan Province is currently suppressing bandits and has not heard of the Fujian affair. Guizhou is currently rectifying its internal affairs and engaging in construction and will definitely not participate in the Fujian affair. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to officials from the Yunnan Provincial Government in Beijing, reports stated that the five southwestern provinces would jointly undergo new changes. Although this office has not received any telegrams from Chairman Long, based on the situation, they dare to responsibly declare that Yunnan Province will definitely not participate. Long has always supported the Central Government and obeyed the government's orders. At this time of national crisis, how could he blindly follow and echo? However, based on personal observations, Yunnan Province, due to its geographical location, may adopt the same attitude as Guizhou and Guangdong in the future. In short, Yunnan is determined not to be drawn into the vortex. In the event of a crisis in strength, it should be able to defend itself without worrying. Chairman Wang Jialie of Guizhou Province telegraphed his representative in Beijing, Xu Chaoguang, to return to the province after the Fujian Incident. Xu has left Beijing and returned to Guizhou. Deng Fufang is temporarily taking over the office. Deng also went to Shanghai yesterday for official business. Guizhou Province does not seem to be involved in the movement to organize the government by Chen Mingshu and others. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhongjun, the representative of He Jian of Hunan, said that he had not received a telegram from He Jian since the Fujian Incident. The external rumors that Hunan was also included in the five provinces are not accurate. Chen Mingshu copied the name of the five provinces to rally support, and Hunan had no time to serve as his cheering squad. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Remarks from a Key Official Regarding the Political Factions in Fujian</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A key official said that the so-called citizens' congress in the Fujian Incident passed a resolution to organize a people's government, and a large number of false officials have also been appointed. However, several factions can be distinguished within this group. For example, Zhang Bojun and Xu Minghong are slightly red. Chen Mingshu and his associates are social democrats. Xu Qian and Huang Qixiang belong to the Third Party. Weng Zhaoyuan and He Gonggan have a strong element of nationalism. Jiang Guangding and Cai Tingkai are military men. In addition, old warlords such as Sa Zhenbing are all important members of their government. Their inability to reach a consensus is to be expected. Fujian has poor land and resources, and the 19th Route Army and the provincial army's military expenditures are unable to be met. They are entirely dependent on the central government's 600,000 and Guangdong's 300,000 in subsidies. If these are not issued, they will be placed in a desperate situation. At a time when both external threats and internal troubles are pressing, organizing a light-red government will definitely not win the sympathy of the people. Moreover, Chen Mingshu claims to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Army of the five provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Guangdong, and Hunan as a slogan. In reality, the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Hunan do not appear to have participated. Their isolation is evident. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

(21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Shuren Discusses the Central Government's Attitude</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren said that since the Central Government heard the news of the Fujian affair, it has sent several telegrams to persuade and hope for a peaceful resolution. Chen Mingshu and others did not comply with the Central Government's intentions. Therefore, the Central Political Council decided last night to impose severe sanctions on them. The Executive Yuan meeting today also discussed the Fujian Province issue and consulted on countermeasures in accordance with the Central Political Council's decision. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Party Headquarters Requests Punishment for Chen Mingshu</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Wuhan and Pinghan Wuchang party headquarters in Hubei Province telegraphed the Central Government on the 21st, requesting the swift expulsion of Chen Mingshu from the party and the issuance of an arrest warrant to maintain discipline. They also telegraphed Jiang and Cai, requesting them to strictly prohibit all reactionary elements from operating in Fujian, and hoping that they would carry forward the spirit of resisting foreign aggression in Shanghai and maintain their glorious history, working together under the unified command of the Central Government to save the country from peril. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Naval Agencies in Fujian Seized</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian Incident has been unveiled on the 21st, and the government has issued a telegram expressing its views. It is reported that all central agencies in Fujian have been taken over, especially the 14 or so agencies directly under the Ministry of the Navy.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a source, the chairman of the Finance Committee of the independent government of Fujian Province is Xu Xiqing (Chen Mingshu's relative). Reports stating Xu Chongqing are incorrect by one character. The government has decided to severely punish Chen for the absurd telegram he sent in Fujian and has ordered military and political organs in various provinces to take measures to prevent any such occurrences.

During the Provincial Government meeting, the Chairman reported the situation, and all the provincial commissioners were extremely indignant. Chen Bulei was recommended to draft a proposal supporting the Central Government and a telegram to the whole country to express the Zhejiang Provincial Government's absolute obedience to the Central Government. The telegram is expected to be sent tonight. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Telegram to Hu Regarding the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>"It is essential to firmly reject and denounce them,</p>
<p>So that you are not unworthy of being a follower of the Premier."</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Jingheng telegraphed Hu Hanmin on the 21st, stating: Regarding the Fujian situation, I initially thought it was a rumor, but unexpectedly, it has become a reality. Their folly has reached an extreme. Chen Youren, Xu Qian, Huang Qixiang, and their followers are not worth blaming, but even true scholars like Ren Chaojing have also participated, which is extremely muddled. There are rumors that you, sir, are also connected to this. I think things are absurd and definitely not to this extent. It is essential to firmly reject and denounce them, so that you are not unworthy of being a follower of the Premier. I will stop here. Yours truly, Wu Jingheng. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary: The Reefs of the Roosevelt Administration (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Some Observations</p>
<p>The Roosevelt administration is currently enveloped in an atmosphere of high inflation. From the authorities to the farmers, almost everyone considers lowering the commodity value of currency as the best way to escape the current panic, regardless of the ultimate consequences. In particular, the majority support for inflation policies in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives is sufficient to illustrate the future of American monetary policy. It is indeed a noteworthy phenomenon in the recovery movement.</p>
<p>However, I cannot help but wonder if the inflation policy will truly contribute to Roosevelt's prosperity plan. Since taking office, Roosevelt has aimed to salvage the panic every day, such as abandoning the gold standard, convening the London Conference, formulating the National Industrial Recovery Act, revising the banking bill, massively purchasing public bonds, and, most recently, manipulating the domestic and foreign gold markets. The methods can be said to be numerous. However, in terms of its effectiveness, not only has there been no gain, but it has also increasingly plunged the American economy into a state of panic. Reviewing his past political achievements, it is no different from using the economic lives of 120 million people as a large experimental field. The current trend toward direct inflation is probably its final experiment. However, since the day Woodin left office, Wall Street financial capitalists, for the sake of protecting creditor interests, have launched attacks on the government, which are no less than plaintive laments. The resolution of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the 18th further confirms this. The promotion of a prosperity plan is supposed to target the entire national economy. Now, the clamor for inflating the currency is high among farmers, and the demonstration movement of financial capitalists has followed. The opposition of social classes is triggered by the shift of benefits caused by inflation. How will this resolve the basic tasks of the recovery movement?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the effect of inflation lies in the upward movement of prices, especially in the development of purchasing power and the elimination of overproduction. Only then can the foundation of prosperity be firmly established. Otherwise, the trial implementation of any policy will only intensify social contradictions and will not save the economic crisis. This can be illustrated by simply observing the facts since Roosevelt took office. According to the various indices published by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, which uses the average of 1923 to 1925 as the base, they are specially recorded as follows:</p>
<p>March 1933　July 1933</p>
<p>Manufacturing Production　57.0　10.10</p>
<p>Factory Employment　56.6　70.1</p>
<p>Factory Wages　36.9　49.9</p>
<p>Store Sales　55.0　71.0</p>
<p>Looking at the above figures, from March to July, the increase in manufacturing production reached 77 percent, while the increase in factory wages was only 35 percent. The increase in factory employment was even less than 23 percent. The increase in production has already exceeded the rate of increase in total wages, and the increase in worker employment is even lagging behind the progress of production. The stagnation in store sales further proves the weakness of social purchasing power. If this is the case and the contradiction of overproduction is not eliminated, it is no wonder that the stalemate of the economic panic will ultimately not be broken. With the Roosevelt government's accumulated months of effort, and the resulting effect is only this much. Now, to say that prosperity can be achieved immediately by means of inflation is not something we dare to believe. In yesterday's (18th) speech in Savannah, Roosevelt admitted that the economic chronic illness has lasted for twelve years. To seek a cure so that everyone benefits is not easy and cannot be achieved in a year. This shows that the success of the recovery plan is not easy.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>Creating Party and Government Organs by Pretending to Reflect Public Opinion</p>
<p>Alliance with Russia and Tolerance of Communism to Implement Land Revolution</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chen Mingshu's organization of the Social Democratic Party and attempt to use the power of the 19th Route Army to rebel against the central government had been brewing for a long time and was well known to outsiders. In recent months, Chen has been living in Hong Kong, actively campaigning. On the one hand, he has been trying to win over the Third Party, and on the other hand, he has been using Third Party leaders such as Huang Qixiang to contact the Communist Party and the bandit troops of the Jiangxi-Fujian region to act in concert with him. At the beginning of this month, Chen went to Fujian from Hong Kong, and this conspiracy gradually became apparent. The Central News Agency reporter inquired in detail from the military and political organs and learned the inside story. The gist is recorded as follows: When Chen first arrived in Fujian, Third Party leaders such as Huang Qixiang accompanied him. They immediately held secret meetings and planned to organize the People's Government of the Republic of China in Fujian. Its internal organization was as follows: Li Jishen as chairman, Chen as administrative commissioner, Cai Tingkai as military and political commissioner, and Xu Xiqing as economic commissioner. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, a citizens' meeting was held in Fuzhou, forcibly violating public opinion to create party and government organs. The Revolutionary Committee was formed by the Third Party and the Social Democratic Party. It is reported that what they are advocating is to implement land revolution, re-adopt the agricultural and industrial policies of the past period of tolerating communism, and say that to save the country today, we must ally with Russia, and to ally with Russia, we must tolerate communism. If the 19th Route Army in Fujian does not ally with the Communists, it will be destroyed by the Communists. As for the flag they planned to adopt, it was half red and half red, yellow, blue, white, and black, all of which were the propositions of the Social Democratic Party and the Third Party. Earlier, when Chen Mingshu was in Hong Kong, Huang Qixiang, Peng Zexiang and others, as representatives, contacted the Communist Party and the Communist bandits of Fujian and Jiangxi separately. Later, on the Communist bandits' side, the wife of Luo Liehui, the false commander-in-chief of the Fujian Military Region, also went to Hong Kong to meet Chen and discussed everything in person. A military agreement of mutual non-aggression has now been reached with the Communist bandits, and it has been agreed that the Fujian side will supply the bandit areas of Jiangxi and Fujian with 300,000 yuan worth of salt, 300,000 yuan worth of medicines, and 100,000 yuan worth of military equipment as a prerequisite for mutual cooperation. The wife of Peng Dehuai, a major Communist bandit leader, and representatives of the Communist bandits are still staying in Fuzhou for further liaison. However, Fujian is close to Taiwan. Once something happens, it is feared that Japan will take advantage of it. Therefore, in recent months, Chen has been working hard to cooperate with Japan. Considering the 19th Route Army's experience in resisting Japan in Shanghai, it could not change its face for a while. It followed Fang Ji's old tricks, still advocating national salvation and resistance to Japan on the one hand, and entrusting Chen Youren, Han Baoli, and others to repeatedly seek understanding from the Taiwan Governor's Office on the other hand. Recently, it was reported that Chen had been assisted with 3 million yuan through Han's agency. Thus, Li Jichun and Fang Zhenwu's comrades are not alone. Analyzing the content of this Fujian incident, it is not simple at all. It is actually using the party to oppose the party, using resistance to Japan to compromise with Japan, and using the suppression of the Communists to cooperate with the Communists. The deception has reached this point. Not only have those who share Chen's political line become suspicious, but even the generals within the 19th Route Army are uneasy.

<h3>Japan's Attitude Toward Fujian: Unwilling to Interfere if There Are No Anti-Japanese Actions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has cabled the Japanese Consul General in Fuzhou, stating that if the Fujian independence movement does not adopt an anti-Japanese attitude or endanger the lives and property of Japanese residents, the Japanese government is unwilling to interfere. Authorities subtly indicated that this directive contained the meaning that if the independence movement in Fujian Province adopted an anti-Japanese attitude or endangered the lives and property of Japanese residents, Japan might have to intervene. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the independence of Fujian, the Foreign Ministry will instruct the Consul General in Fuzhou, Moriya, and Minister Arima with the following policy: Although the Japanese government adheres to the principle of non-interference in China's internal strife, if the Chinese side adopts non-friendly, anti-Japanese actions, it is prepared to take necessary measures. Therefore, if the new government threatens the lives and property of Japanese residents in the name of establishing tariff autonomy and abolishing unequal treaties, it will definitely take appropriate defensive measures. Furthermore, if there are political or military instigations by a third country behind the scenes, Japan cannot remain indifferent based on the spirit of the non-cession and non-exchange documents of Fujian. (Dentsu dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in view of the new program of the independent government of Fujian Province, which inevitably has communist and anti-Japanese colors, attaches great importance to the situation in Fujian Province. He immediately cabled the Consul General in Fuzhou, Moriya, and other Japanese officials stationed in Xiamen and other places, saying that Japan takes a non-interference policy on China's internal strife, but hopes that efforts will be made to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents. (Dentsu dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Shantou Bank Run Gradually Subsiding</h3>
<p>(Shantou) There were rumors about the Provincial Bank branch's banknotes on the 19th. It happened to be Sunday, and the bank exceptionally opened for exchange, causing quite a run. There was still a run on the 20th, but it gradually subsided on the 21st. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Summoned to Beijing: To Discuss Matters Regarding Fujian</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun was summoned to Nanjing by telegram from Wang Jingwei to discuss important matters. Zhang is scheduled to take the Ning Shao steamer east on the evening of the 21st. Government affairs will be handled by the Chief Secretary Lu Zhu. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Because of the changes in Fujian Province, Wang summoned Zhang Qun by telegram on the 21st to discuss important plans. Zhang took the Wusong steamer to Beijing at 9:00 p.m. on the 21st. Military and political dignitaries boarded the ship to see him off. Zhang said that this trip was to discuss the current situation with Wang. He had not heard the truth about the Fujian incident. He should be able to get accurate information after arriving in Beijing. At a time when there is both internal strife and external threats, we must unite to survive. The changes made by Chen and others were unexpected. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun is going to Beijing to discuss the Fujian incident and will visit Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi on his way back to report on two matters: 1. The immigration of people from the border area was agreed upon with Liu Zhenhua, and he will ask for instructions on how to handle the refugee resettlement issue. 2. The Farmers' Bank of the Four Provinces will jointly issue ocean currency with the Hubei Provincial Bank and form a treasury with Shen Zhaonian as the treasurer, and will ask Chiang for instructions. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Talks About the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi said that the Fujian incident had been brewing for a long time. When Chen Mingshu was in Hong Kong, there was talk of this. At that time, Mr. Hu Zhantang was also in Hong Kong and quite agreed. Later, Chen actually included the Third Party and democratic socialists to participate. People like Huang Qixiang and Zhang Bojun have already assumed important positions in Fujian. Hu, who hated evil as much as he hated an enemy, stopped his intention to enter Fujian. However, this Fujian incident is quite unwise. The Guangdong side and the central government have always been outwardly harmonious but inwardly divided. The sudden change in Fujian happened to give them an opportunity to unite. In addition to ordering military and political organs in various provinces and cities to take strict precautions, the central government does not need to send personnel to Fujian to investigate. Chiang Kai-shek has sent a telegram to transfer the central government's intentions. Chiang Kai-shek originally wanted to eliminate the trouble invisibly, so he specially sent a Sikes plane to Fujian to bring Cai Tingkai to Jiangxi for a trip so that he could explain in person. Unexpectedly, the Fujian side repeatedly prevaricated and detained the plane when the opportunity was ripe. As for confiscating the Central Bank and various agencies in Fujian, it is inevitable. As for how to deal with it, it depends on how the changes develop. However, it is expected that under the strict precautions on all sides, the situation will not be too great. Chu also said that the central government has now flown orders to the provincial and municipal governments and the garrisons in various places to pay close attention to and quickly deal with this disturbance. The Fujian Marine Corps and the navy stationed in Fujian were originally under the command of the Director of Pacification of Fujian. Now that Fujian has openly rebelled, the government has also ordered the navy and marine corps there to quickly deal with it and respond accordingly. The central government is now suppressing bandits and winning victories one after another. Chen and others have started a rebellion in Fujian Province and are sparing no effort to supply the Red bandits with food and salt, which is tantamount to helping the bandits do evil. The Red bandits, in their poverty, will naturally be happy to accept it, and perhaps they have a conspiracy to occupy Fujian Province and open up a sea outlet in the future.

<h3>Sun Ke Returns to Nanjing from Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 21st. According to him, Yu and others went to Shanghai originally intending to eliminate the Fujian incident invisibly. Yesterday, we received a telegram from the central government urging us to return to Nanjing, so we took the night train to rush here. At the beginning of the brewing of the Fujian situation, the central government was based on the broad and tolerant intention to persuade them to dispel their delusions. Unexpectedly, Chen and others are now launching an attack in Fujian, and the central government has decided to deal with it severely. Someone asked what the Guangdong side would do about Fujian, Sun replied that Chen Jitang had taken precautions during the brewing of the Fujian situation and had transferred capable troops to guard the Guangdong-Fujian border.

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong: Preparing to Return to Nanjing to Report; Old Mongolian Areas in Suiyuan and Chahar Provinces: Will Establish Autonomous Region Governments; Qin Dechun Arrives in Suiyuan to Discuss Important Public Affairs</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong telegraphed from Beiping this morning, stating that the results of this trip to Bailingmiao to negotiate were satisfactory. Prince De and other princes have abandoned their original proposal to establish an autonomous government. The outline for resolving the Mongolian issue has also been decided. He will return to Beiping from Suiyuan within a few days to report to Nanjing. On the way back to Beiping, he plans to take a detour to Bingyuan to inspect the political situation in Shanxi Province. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Guihua) According to Qin Dechun, who arrived in Suiyuan by special train from Zhangjiakou on the afternoon of the 21st, this visit was at Huang's invitation to discuss important matters. Song believes that as long as the central government makes a decision on the issue of Mongolian autonomy, he will absolutely obey. The Mongolian people's demand for autonomy is based on the meaning of equality of the five races and should be sympathized with and assisted to prevent the Mongolian people from going astray. If they separate from the central government, it is naturally unacceptable. It is planned to meet with Huang Zhuan tonight. Song can arrive in Beiping on the evening of the 21st. He has telegraphed to urge me to visit him, so I do not intend to stay in Suiyuan for long. I will go to Beiping on the 22nd to discuss the aftermath in Chahar Province. Tang's army is said to number 16,000. Since entering Chahar, the supplies have been enormous. Chahar has exhausted its financial resources and must quickly find a solution. Qin then went to the Xingyuan to meet with Zhao Pilian. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>At noon on the 21st, Prince De and Bao Yueqing and others paid their respects to the Panchen Lama to bid farewell. At 2:00 p.m., they left the temple and returned to the Wangfu of Yao Su Nite. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>A joint celebration meeting is planned to be held in Suiyuan in the coming days. Chuan Zuoyi telegraphed to Prince De and others on the 19th, welcoming them to Suiyuan to communicate their feelings. Prince De said that he had been away from the banner for a long time and that the affairs of the league and banner needed to be sorted out. He returned to the prince's mansion at 2:00 p.m. on the 21st. (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said that the princes of various leagues and banners in Mongolia originally planned to gather the Mongolian people of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces to organize a Mongolian autonomous government, completely severing relations with the governments of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. Later, Huang and Zhao personally went to Bailingmiao and sincerely persuaded and explained the righteousness. The princes understood the central government's painstaking efforts and no longer held their own opinions. They decided to abandon the autonomous government and follow the established principles, with slight changes. It is planned to establish an autonomous body for each of the Xilingol League in Chahar Province and the Ulanqab Yikezhao League in Suiyuan Province, which are in a parallel position with the provincial governments of Chahar and Suiyuan, and are still subject to the supervision and guidance of the central government to complete the outline of Mongolian local autonomy and improve the economic life of the Mongolian people. Although the outline was agreed upon by Huang, Zhao, and the princes, more detailed consultations will be made after arriving in Suiyuan, but the final decision will have to wait for Huang and Zhao to return to Nanjing and submit it to the Central Political Conference. The names of the agencies, the number of members, and the powers of the agencies will also be decided by the Central Political Conference. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian telegraphed to Nanjing after arriving in Suiyuan, saying that the Mongolian affairs had been substantially resolved, and Prince De and others accepted the central government's intentions and voluntarily abandoned their preconceptions. From now on, the problem is only to properly plan and implement the measures in accordance with the established policy. All the details of the comforting process will be reported upon their return to Nanjing. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Nasatu and five other representatives who returned to Beiping from Bailingmiao gave a detailed account of the Bailingmiao meeting. Autonomous region governments will be established in the old Mongolian areas of Suiyuan and Chahar provinces. The names will be the First Autonomous Region Government of Mongolia and the Second Autonomous Region Government of Mongolia. There is no conflict with the two provinces of Huan and Cha. The rest can be inferred by analogy. The First District of Mongolia is the Ulanqab League, the Yikezhao League, and the Matte Independent Banner. The Second District is the Xilingol League, the Chahar League, and the Feng Autonomous Region Governments. They are directly under the Executive Yuan of the Central Government. In the event of matters involving provinces and counties, they will be handled jointly with the provincial government. The Mongolian autonomous region governments will manage all political affairs of each alliance and banner within their respective regions. Each autonomous region will have a chairman, two vice-chairmen, and two to four full-time members. The head of each banner will be an ex officio member. According to the actual situation, departments and offices will be established to take charge of the autonomous region government. A joint meeting will be established, and each autonomous region and each banner may send one representative to organize it to discuss and decide on matters of common concern to each autonomous region. The expenses of the autonomous region government will be directly allocated by the central government. The details will have to wait for the Executive Yuan to submit detailed discussions, which will be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review: 1. The candidates for chairman, vice-chairmen, and full-time members of the First and Second Autonomous Regions. 2. Detailed rules for the internal organization of the autonomous region. 3. The amount of funds for the autonomous region government. 4. The management method of Mongolian and Han people in the counties established in Sui and Cha. The counties established in Mongolian areas are mostly inhabited by both Mongolian and Han people. The original livelihood land tax issues of the Mongolian people, as well as the areas that have not yet been enclosed into counties, will be discussed and decided. Most of the Mongolian lands are used for grazing and production by the Mongolian people. Areas that have not yet been enclosed into counties will be stopped and used exclusively as pastures. The issue of tax revenue in the Mongolian areas of the counties established in Sui and Cha will be jointly managed by the Sui and Cha provincial governments and the first and second autonomous region governments, adopting an equal distribution policy. Predetermined policies for the first and second autonomous region governments: 1. Agriculture: implement land reclamation and afforestation. 2. Grazing: improve grazing industry using scientific methods. 3. Industry: exploit minerals and manufacture leather and fur products. 4. Transportation: each league and banner will implement the construction of motor vehicle companies to connect traffic and railways. Railways will not be established temporarily due to factual and economic reasons. 5. Post: consult with the Ministry of Communications to implement postal services in various places. 6. Education: adopt two types: A. Military education; B. Vocational education. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Franco-American-Italian Understanding: Overall Resolution of the European Situation, Disarmament Conference Recesses for Negotiations with Germany, League of Nations Covenant Expected to Undergo Major Revision</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After continuing discussions on disarmament issues with representatives of the major powers in Geneva today, the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, has convened the main committee to meet on Wednesday. The major powers have designated a drafting committee to prepare a proposal for the general committee to adjourn until after the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on January 10th, and then reconvene. Simultaneously, the technical committee will continue for another seven or eight days after the adjournment. During this period, governments, including Germany, will exchange diplomatic documents to clarify the situation. It is reported that the negotiations will extend beyond the structure of the Disarmament Conference. The most important powers will meet in January next year. It is rumored that significant progress has been made, and even French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour is satisfied with the progress of the discussions.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon is leaving for London tonight, but will return to Geneva if necessary. Judging by appearances, the main committee will adjourn on Wednesday, and Simon may not need to return. British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Eden, will remain in Geneva as the British representative. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is leaving for Rome tonight, ostensibly to attend Schanzer's funeral, but it is widely believed that Avenol will discuss Italy's attitude towards the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The issue of Henderson's resignation was not mentioned during today's disarmament discussions. It appears that Henderson's strong words regarding the conference have had an effect, and he views the current adjournment as something that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>It is widely believed that British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Geneva has cleared the air. Paul-Boncour claims that the attitudes of Britain and France are now closer than before. According to general opinion, the exchange of diplomatic documents offers the best opportunity for genuine progress. The so-called negotiation scope extending beyond the Disarmament Conference implies that the reorganization of the League of Nations and the future of the Saar region will also be discussed. If so, the upcoming conference will be different from the Disarmament Conference. No wonder there are rumors that the conference will be held in Italy. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, after consultations between the four major powers, they have agreed in principle to suspend the work of the Disarmament Conference pending private negotiations with Germany. However, the final decision will await a renewed meeting of the representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy today, before being submitted to the Main Committee meeting tomorrow for approval. It is reported that there is no longer a question about the four major powers and Germany immediately starting negotiations in Italy. The duration of the Disarmament Conference's adjournment is expected to be decided today. It is anticipated that the conference will be suspended until the end of January. At that time, the British, French, and Italian governments will, through their diplomatic representatives, separately discuss and agree on the date and location for private negotiations with Germany. It is reported that Italian representative De Suella has not yet notified other countries' representatives of the Italian Prime Minister's invitation to negotiate in Rome, but observers believe that as soon as the Disarmament Conference decides to suspend proceedings, De Suella will issue this invitation. Tonight, a spokesman for the American delegation announced that during yesterday's four-country consultation, American representative Wilson formally proposed expanding the scope of private talks to include other countries. Chairman Henderson expressed his support, but was opposed by representatives from Italy, Britain, and France. It is understood that the countries the United States wants to invite to join are clearly Japan and Soviet Russia. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Avenol Visits Mussolini for Negotiations: Plan to Reorganize League of Nations, Separation of Covenant from Treaty of Versailles, Allowing the US, Russia, Germany, and Japan to Join</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The situation of Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations has become so serious that it necessitates a special visit by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Furthermore, it is reported that a major plan to reorganize the structure of the League of Nations is currently under consideration. Avenol departs for Rome tonight, ostensibly to attend the funeral of former Italian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council in 1929, Schanzer. However, according to reliable sources, his true purpose is to persuade Mussolini not to withdraw from the League of Nations. Key figures in diplomatic circles here have verified that Avenol's sudden decision to travel to Rome came after receiving confidential information about Italy's attitude. A diplomat familiar with the inner workings of the League of Nations also stated that politicians in this region and in Europe and America all recognize the threat of Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations as a most serious problem. Although the claim that a plan to reorganize the League of Nations is under consideration has been denied by a highly involved individual, reliable sources are deeply aware that a major change in the structure and policies of the League of Nations is currently being planned. The denial by the individual is probably because they fear that premature disclosure would hinder progress. It is reported that the goal of this reorganization is to make the power of the League of Nations more universal and to make it easier to handle world problems. It was recently learned from an extremely reliable source that before going to Rome, Avenol consulted Belgian legal expert Paul Hymans, who currently serves as the Belgian representative to the Disarmament Conference and a professor at the Geneva Institute of International Studies, on the method of revising the covenant and reorganizing the League. It is reported that Hymans has drafted a new reorganization plan, but Hymans himself denied it tonight, only admitting that Avenol had sought his opinion on the revision issue. However, those close to Hymans insist that he has drafted a plan to separate the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles, and to greatly revise the Covenant, expanding the purpose of the League of Nations while reducing the guarantee of treaty obligations, allowing the US, Russia, Germany, and Japan to join. In addition, it is proposed to expand the number of members of the Executive Council, establish an executive committee, and reduce the number of secret meetings of the League of Nations Assembly. As for the military arbitration in Article 16 of the current Covenant, it may be deleted in Hymans's new proposal. Italian sources here believe that Avenol may present this reorganization plan to Mussolini in an attempt to persuade Italy to remain in the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Bold Words: Views League of Nations as a Patient; Italy Has No Intention of Hastily Leaving the Sickbed</h3>
<p>Rome: Prime Minister Mussolini has declared to the French ambassador that his policies do not intend to break away from the League of Nations. The Grand Council of Fascism will discuss the relationship between Italy and the League of Nations on December 5th, but this is merely a routine procedure. This is the first meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. A year ago, when the council discussed the League of Nations issue, Prime Minister Mussolini said that the League of Nations is now a patient and Italy should not stay away from the sickbed. The general public here believes that if Italy were to withdraw from the League of Nations, the friendly relations between Britain and Italy would inevitably become strained. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Italy Initiate Discussion of a New International Conference to Discuss Important World Political Issues</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to widely circulated but completely unconfirmed reports here today, British Prime Minister MacDonald or Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will soon convene a new international conference to discuss important global political issues. Participants will be limited to a selection of major and minor powers, including the United States, Soviet Russia, and Japan. The issues to be discussed will primarily be the reorganization of the League of Nations, revision of the Covenant, and the issue of League of Nations mandated territories. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: According to informed sources here today, the Fascist leader will take the opportunity of the Fascist Grand Council meeting in early December to formally express Italy's position on the League of Nations. Regarding rumors that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will redefine his foreign policy, the authorities have firmly stated that the general direction will not change, but will advocate first convening a conference of major powers, and then convening a disarmament conference to seriously engage in work. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a telegram from a Paris Evening News correspondent in Geneva, the "Small Disarmament Conference" will likely be held in San Remo, Italy, as soon as possible. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour intends to participate. The participants will not only be the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact, but also countries with direct relations to Franco-German amity, such as Soviet Russia, Poland, Belgium, and the Little Entente. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is certain that Germany and the four major powers will immediately begin negotiations in Italy, but it is expected that Britain, France, and Italy will still arrange a transitional meeting through their ambassadors to Germany, so that the Disarmament Conference can proceed quickly when it reconvenes. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) There are rumors here that the Disarmament Conference may be held outside of Geneva, with Germany participating. We initially reported on this matter yesterday, but whether this is practical or a trial balloon remains to be seen. However, practically speaking, our representative received confirmation from the most reliable American sources this morning that British Foreign Secretary Simon, before returning to London, had sounded out the American representative on the attitude the American government would take if Britain or Italy proposed holding the Disarmament Conference outside of Geneva. We have further learned that Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson made similar inquiries to Soviet representative Dovgalevsky. Diplomatic circles here are surprised to learn that Henderson has made this contact, as it seems inappropriate for Henderson personally to abandon Geneva and hold a European conference in an Italian city. The explanation for Henderson's actions is that he has received assurances from the British and Italian governments, or perhaps even from the German government, that he will still have a role to play, for example, chairing the disarmament committee at this European conference. In addition, Henderson has been assured that regardless of the outcome of this conference, the Geneva Disarmament Conference will still be discussed, or at least recognized. What is practical is only so much. Beyond that, once the date and agenda of the European conference are mentioned, there is no shortage of ambiguity and conjecture. Thinking carefully, even if such a conference is successful, it may not be held within this year or early next year. Because the major powers decided yesterday to seek a solution to the Disarmament Conference through diplomatic channels, this will not be accomplished in a day or a month. Considering the negotiations for the Four-Power Pact took several weeks, it is known that the future Disarmament Convention will also take a long time to come to fruition. As for the agenda of the European conference, it is reported that the organizers intend for this conference to have a broader agenda than the Disarmament Conference, and its nature is almost a peace conference, in other words, a conference to revise existing treaties. As such, it is difficult to say whether such a conference can be held before Britain or Italy expresses a clear view. However, there is strong opposition to this plan in various countries, especially Poland and the Little Entente countries, who do not want to hear about a European conference involving the revision of existing treaties. Therefore, this plan may not make progress in the coming days, but Britain will maintain this view and continue to explore, and because this proposition has been widely leaked, Britain's ability to act is becoming increasingly cautious.

<h3>Speech at the Opening of Parliament: British Monarch Supports League of Nations; Continues Cooperation with Other Countries to Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>(London) Parliament opened today, and the British monarch delivered a speech, stating that the British government's greatest interest is to promote world peace and maintain it with all its strength. The British government will continue to cooperate with other governments to seek a satisfactory solution to the complex issue of disarmament, so as to establish a method acceptable to all parties and achieve the satisfactory conclusion of the Disarmament Conference's long-term work. The British government is determined to maintain the work of international cooperation through the League of Nations mechanism and other methods that can promote good relations between countries and peoples. He then said that he hoped that the Joint Committee on the Indian Constitution could complete its hard work in a timely manner so that practical proposals could be submitted to Parliament in the form of legislation during this parliamentary session. The British monarch then spoke of British industry and commerce, saying that a noteworthy development in the past year was the gradual restoration of confidence in the future of British industry and commerce, which should be maintained and promoted. Cabinet members are carefully paying attention to the sound principle of controlling spending and adopting plans that can encourage enterprise, striving to enable the country to return to a state where the burden on the people can be lightened. Cabinet members will also continue to work to create an environment conducive to export trade, through negotiating trade agreements, hoping to obtain opportunities to develop the cotton, coal, and other export industries. Regarding the unemployment problem, the government will propose a fundamentally sound unemployment insurance plan and establish a system to assist unemployed people not covered by this insurance.

<h3>Freedom in a Democratic Nation: Labor Party Member Formerly Imprisoned, Now Vigorously Speaks in Parliament</h3>
<p>(London) Today, after the British monarch finished delivering his speech in Parliament, left-wing Labor Party member McGovern shouted loudly, "What about the means test for unemployment benefits? It is a disgrace that people are starving to death!" McGovern made this statement, gesticulating to express his disapproval of the solemn and magnificent scene in Parliament. However, the British monarch and queen paid no attention and left the venue in order. McGovern is a former sheet metal worker, then a foreman, and in 1930 became an insurance agent. He was elected to Parliament that year. He has been ordered to leave the chamber repeatedly for causing trouble for the Speaker. In 1931, he was imprisoned for speaking recklessly outside and participating in unemployment riots. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Today, when the British monarch delivered the opening speech to Parliament in the House of Lords, Member of Parliament McGovern suddenly interrupted, shouting, "How will unemployment be solved? You lazy parasites, living on the wealth created by others, should be ashamed. Think of the people outside who are starving to death!" Afterwards, McGovern told reporters, "I have no regrets. I was extremely indignant at the time." (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Japan Becomes a World of Assassination: Wakatsuki Narrowly Escapes Two Assassination Attempts Yesterday Morning; Attacked First at Ueno Station and Later in Yamato Village; Assailants Were a Martial Artist and a Retired Soldier, Both Arrested; Assassination Motivated by Opposition to London Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) An assassination attempt on Wakatsuki, the chief Japanese delegate to the London Naval Conference, failed this morning. Wakatsuki had just returned to Tokyo from somewhere this morning. As he was getting off the train, a young man, wielding a dagger, broke through the crowd and attempted to assassinate him, but was apprehended by the police before he could reach Wakatsuki.</p>
<p>Wakatsuki has served as Prime Minister twice, Minister of Finance twice, Minister of Home Affairs once, and Vice Minister of Finance twice, making him a prominent figure in Japanese politics. He has narrowly escaped danger several times because ardent Japanese patriots believe that his signing of the naval ratio agreement damaged Japan's national defense and branded him as a traitor. The assailant this morning was Noguchi, a famous Japanese martial artist. At the same time, another young man also attempted an assassination, but had already fled when the police arrived. It is reported that today's incident is related to the recent movement against the London Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>The assailant who escaped with Noguchi after the unsuccessful assassination attempt on Wakatsuki this morning later loitered outside Wakatsuki's residence, attempting a second assassination, and was arrested by the police in front of the house. His name is Matsui. Both assailants are members of a reactionary organization. However, according to Noguchi, he was implicated in the May 15th Incident and other cases, and naval cadets have recently undergone military trials, so he was angered by the naval treaty and attempted to assassinate Wakatsuki, and was not in collusion with Matsui. However, Noguchi has confessed that he and Matsui recently purchased daggers specifically to assassinate Wakatsuki. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Two Unsuccessful Assassination Attempts</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Wakatsuki Reijiro, the president of the Minseito party, attended a party conference in the Hokushin area. He was returning to Tokyo on the 21st and arrived at Ueno Station at 7:00 AM. As he exited the gate and was about to get into his car, a ruffian suddenly jumped out of the crowd, wielding a short sword, intending to stab Wakatsuki. However, he was arrested by escorting police officers before he could approach Wakatsuki. After Wakatsuki returned home, he took a train from Ueno Station to his Izu villa at 8:40 AM. (Jiji Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The assailant who attempted to assassinate Wakatsuki, Matsui Haruo, fled upon seeing Noguchi's arrest, but went all the way to Wakatsuki's residence in Hongo Yamato Village, attempting to carry out the attack again. He was discovered in front of the house and arrested. Matsui retired from the military this October and often talked about patriotic issues. (Jiji Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>Wakatsuki Remains Calm</h3>
<p>Atami: Wakatsuki, who narrowly escaped disaster at Ueno Station, took a train from Tokyo Station to his villa in Ito at 9:05 AM. He got off the train at Atami Station, and said the following, "Wherever I go, if I am destined to suffer, there is no way to avoid it. Therefore, I am always fully prepared. So, whether to help or not is irrelevant, let fate decide." Wakatsuki remained quite calm after this near-death experience. (Jiji Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Wakatsuki Reijiro, who was attacked twice this morning at his residence and Ueno Station, said at his residence that life and death are in the hands of Heaven, and that he has dedicated his life to the country. He spoke calmly, as usual. Wakatsuki still went to Ito at 9:05 AM for rest, as planned, and intends to stay there for a week. (Denstu, 21st)</p>
<h3>Assailant's Motive</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Metropolitan Police Department arrested the assailant who attacked Wakatsuki, they conducted a thorough interrogation. The assailant's name is Noguchi Susumu, 27 years old, a heavyweight boxer belonging to the Japan Boxing Club founded by Kano Kenjiro in Hyogo Prefecture. He was injured in the ribs during a recent match against a British Asian Fleet athlete, and came to Tokyo from Hyogo Prefecture. He is quite violent and has committed assault crimes. The authorities are currently investigating the purpose and motive of his attack, and the relationship behind it. A letter of advice was found in his possession. There is another assailant who escaped into the crowd when he saw that the purpose was not achieved. The authorities are vigorously searching for his whereabouts. Also, it is reported that the assailants who attempted to assassinate Wakatsuki were Noguchi Susumu and Matsui Haruo, both members of the Patriotic Youth League, which was founded by Lin Itiro, the lawyer for the naval defendants in the May 15th Incident. (Jiji Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to police investigation, Noguchi Susumu came to Tokyo from Kobe on October 8th. On the 6th of this month, regarding the Sagoya case of assassination of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, he listened to the case in court, and discussed the case with his friend Matsui Haruo, saying that Sagoya's death sentence was a result of the failure of the London Treaty, and that Baron Wakatsuki should commit seppuku to atone for his crime. He decided to advise Wakatsuki and urge him to commit suicide. He discussed this with Matsui several times, and arranged to hand over the letter of advice when Wakatsuki departed from Ueno Station on the 19th of this month, and to carry out extortion. He purchased two short swords. On the 21st, at 6:45 AM, he waited for Wakatsuki at Ueno Station. Noguchi produced the letter of advice and a short sword and was threatening him when he was arrested by the police. At that time, Matsui chased after the car that Wakatsuki was riding in and was arrested by the police. It is reported that the police intend to charge Noguchi with extortion. The main contents of the letter of advice held by Noguchi are as follows: "Sagoya was sentenced to death, which was the result of the failure of the London Treaty, and Baron Wakatsuki should commit seppuku to atone for his crime." (Jiji Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Noguchi Susumu, at the Metropolitan Police Department, has consistently denied any relationship with right-wing groups and any behind-the-scenes mastermind, and confessed that he had this act because he was angered by the London Treaty. However, the authorities believe that Kano Kenjiro, the president of the Japan Boxing Association, was the mastermind behind him and are conducting an investigation. (Jiji Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The true intention of Noguchi Susumu in attacking Baron Wakatsuki was not to assassinate Wakatsuki, but to advise him to commit seppuku, but the incident seems to have been organized by a group, so the Metropolitan Police Department is making every effort to search for the mastermind behind the scenes, and as a result, a second Blood Pledge Corps may be discovered. (Denstu, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Iwata Ainosuke, the head of the Aikoku-sha, spoke as follows regarding the assassination attempt on Wakatsuki, the president of the Minseito party: Noguchi and Matsui were previously members of our company. Noguchi became a boxer four or five years ago, and Matsui joined the Taiwan Independence Garrison, and their relationship with the Aikoku-sha has been severed. At the boxing tournament at the end of October, Noguchi suddenly visited, and at that time he thought that his thinking had not changed. (Denstu, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japan's Siberian Intervention: Litvinov Implies in Speech That Demand for Damages Will Not Be Abandoned</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The terms of the current resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia are more favorable and extensive than those agreed with other countries. The most notable is that Soviet Russia abandoned its claim for damages suffered due to the United States' intervention in Siberia in 1918. According to Ambassador Debuchi's report on the 20th, the reason for this is that Soviet Russia indicated that Japan's intervention in Siberia was an illegal act. According to Ambassador Debuchi's report, Litvinov stated at the Washington News Association on the day of the establishment of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, that the reason why the Soviet Union abandoned the right to claim damages for the United States' intervention in Siberia was that when he visited the State Department, he admitted that the United States' intervention was an act for which the Soviet Union should be grateful. According to the explanation of the United States' intervention, the purpose of the United States' intervention was not to fight the extremists, but to protect Russian territory and monitor the Japanese army. Japan's intervention was a military intervention to prevent the Soviet Russian labor revolution. In other words, Japan's Siberian intervention was due to a counter-revolutionary military intervention. Litvinov implied in his words that the Soviet Union would not abandon the claim for damages for Japan's intervention. If negotiations on debt and credit issues are established between the United States and Russia, then Japan, based on the Japanese-Russian Basic Treaty of Yoshizawa-Karakhan, would naturally enjoy the same benefits. However, Litvinov's words and actions deliberately prevented Japan from enjoying this benefit. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recognizes that Litvinov's statement denies the explicit text of the Japanese-Russian Basic Agreement and attaches great importance to the future. (Jiji Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome: It is reported that Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, after agreeing with US President Roosevelt on the Russian-American resumption of diplomatic relations treaty, is currently still in the United States and is scheduled to travel to Rome on the 25th of this month aboard an Italian postal ship, and then return to Russia from Rome. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Russia Aviation Agreement: U.S. Engineers to Russia to Establish Aircraft Manufacturing Plant</h3>
<p>(Harbin) It is heard that United Airlines of the United States and the Soviet Russian government have signed a contract to establish an aircraft manufacturing plant in Soviet Russia. A large number of American technicians have already been dispatched. Furthermore, American military supply manufacturers, recruited by Soviet Russia, have sent many outstanding experts to Soviet Russia. (Telegraph from the 21st) According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of the 14th, the American Notification News announced on the 12th that the U.S. and Russia had reached an agreement to establish and assist an aircraft plant. The report stated that representatives of the Soviet Russian Federation and the American Curtis-Wright Aeronautical Corporation had discussed establishing an aircraft plant in Russia. The plant will be under American supervision and is expected to be completed soon. This plan has been approved by the U.S. Army and Navy to assist in Soviet Russia's five-year plan to expand military and commercial aviation. Specifically regarding the eastern border, Moscow's response hinted at coercing Japan. It is heard that the American company can earn millions of dollars annually from this plan. In addition to Curtis-Wright's president, Mr. Mulheron, taking full responsibility for guidance, the Budd Wheel Company will also dispatch several supervisors to Russia.</p>
<h3>U.S. Streamlines Tax Revenue: Annual Increase of 300 to 400 Million Dollars</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to sources today, the national tax law is currently being revised. As a result, the national income tax revenue will increase by 300 to 400 million dollars annually without increasing income tax rates. The plan proposed by the House Ways and Means Committee advocates for the repeal of all changes to income tax laws since 1920. Various exceptions currently enjoyed by individuals and companies may be entirely abolished. The Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Democrat Hill, will submit its detailed report, the result of a week's research, to the tax experts of the bicameral Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation for review. Whether companies can continue to file consolidated reports is also a question the Ways and Means Committee wants to submit to the bicameral committee for review. The bicameral Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation is scheduled to meet on December 4 to review the current practice of deducting 50% for depreciation and liquidation purposes, as well as the required amount for debt repayment. These points will also be discussed in the report. Hill predicts that if the Ways and Means Committee's proposal is passed by Congress, the nation can collect an additional 300 to 400 million dollars in income tax annually without raising taxes, as individuals and companies will have to pay income tax on all actual income. As for the losses reported in the current year, they can be deducted from income. (Reuter's telegram from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a report today, since the U.S. government began buying gold domestically in the most recent week of October, it has collected a total of 265,000 ounces of cash, paying a price of $7.55 million.

<h3>Where Did the Earthquake Strike? London Meteorological Observatory Has Records, Location Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday at 11:28 PM, the Meteorological Observatory's seismograph recorded a violent earthquake. Its epicenter was either in the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, or at the 140th meridian. Seismologist Moren confirmed that when London recorded the earthquake for sixty minutes, the needle on the seismograph swayed a maximum distance of ten inches, indicating the severity of the tremor. A seismologist at the West Bromwich Meteorological Observatory expressed the opinion that the epicenter was very close to England, and that the earthquake was felt worldwide last night. According to a Reuter's reporter in London, the Black Sea earthquake theory has not been verified. A Reuter's reporter in Sydney also telegraphed, stating that they recorded an earthquake at the same time as London last night, estimating its epicenter to be on a straight line between New Guinea and Japan. A Reuter's reporter in Victoria, British Columbia, telegraphed, reporting that the local meteorological observatory recorded an earthquake, its severity being unprecedented. According to their report, the epicenter was 2,300 miles away, approximately in Mexico or Siberia. (Reuter's telegram from the 21st)</p>

It is expected that a general agreement can be reached before the first of next month to abolish Japan's boycott of Indian cotton and reduce India's newly imposed 75% high tariffs on Japanese textiles.

<h3>Japanese Communist Party: Opposes Imperial System, Advocates Independence for Korea and Taiwan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the general crackdown on the Japanese Communist Party last October, the central committee has been striving to rebuild and began rapid activity. The Metropolitan Police Department arrested Ishigami Nagatoshi, the standing chairman of the central committee, in February of this year and cracked down on the remaining elements. They made great efforts to crack down nationwide until October 6, eliminating the entire Xie system organization. By mid-November, the total number of people arrested reached 1,696, including 926 women and Koreans. Ninety-two people were prosecuted. Their platform was quite radical, such as opposing the imperial system, seeking independence for Korea and Taiwan, and supporting Soviet Russia. Furthermore, Kano Jigoro's second son, Fumikata, a member of the House of Peers, was an influential figure, engaging in vigorous activity. He organized an embezzlement group to raise funds for the establishment of a labor-peasant government, ordering rice store employee Kamisugawa Zenji to embezzle thousands of dollars. His sinister hand even extended to the Hydrographic Department of the Navy, elementary school teachers, and the fish market hospital. (Electric News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Telegram: Soviet Russia Kills Chinese Workers: Fifty Workers Shot by Russian Soldiers</h3>

It is said that the Chinese workers tried to cross the border into "Manchukuo" without proper passports. (Electric News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>

The Jiangnan Company's reason is that the slightly lower fares are the number approved by the city government, and it is impossible to increase them. This is not a problem between the various vehicle guilds and the company. (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Yu Youren and Shao Lizi Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) President Yu returned to the province from Sanyuan on the 20th in a car sent by the Pacification Commissioner's Office, accompanied by Secretary Zhang Geng. On the 21st at noon, he and Chairman Shao took a car to Tongguan and transferred to the Longhai Railway to return to Nanjing. According to Yu, after inspecting Shaanxi this time, he deeply understands that disaster relief cannot be achieved solely by relying on relief funds and must start with fundamental solutions. After inspecting the Jing, Wei, and Luo rivers, he believes that there is an urgent need to build water conservancy projects. After returning to Nanjing, he will request the central government to allocate funds quickly so that they can be completed as soon as possible. Furthermore, the people of Shaanxi have low levels of knowledge and lack the skills to make a living, so primary education is urgently needed, but years of disasters have made it impossible to raise funds. Therefore, he advocates first establishing forest farms in Jingyuan and implementing a paulownia planting plan, gradually expanding it. In a few years, a vast forest can be formed, and the income from forest products can be used as primary education funds. Shao said that he had repeatedly received telegrams from Song, Wang, and Jiang urging him to formulate a plan for the construction of the Northwest and promote entry into Nanjing for detailed discussion. Therefore, he asked the central government for a two-week leave to go to Nanjing to discuss concrete plans and report on the recent provincial government situation. During this time, the administrative affairs will be handled by Director Hu. (Central News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Xu Prefecture Requests Closure of the Hanzhuang Sluice Gate</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Xuzhou Administrative Inspector's Office received a report from the Tongshan and Pi counties and the Weishan Lake Fishermen's Self-Defense Corps, stating that the county magistrate of Teng County had recently personally led a large number of police and soldiers to remove nine sections of the ear boards from the Hanzhuang Sluice Gate, through which the Weishan Canal passes, causing the lake water to flow wildly towards the canal. The counties of Pi and Sui in the lower reaches will suffer damage. The motive for opening the gate was a secret agreement between Teng and Pei counties to release the lake water and prepare to dry up the surrounding lake fields. Commissioner She Nianci reported that Weishan Lake is located between Jiangsu and Shandong provinces and is situated in the lower reaches. The terrain is the lowest, and all the waters of Shandong flow to this lake. This time, Teng County removed the gate panels, and the residents along the lake and on both sides of the Central Canal have lost all protection. The release of Shandong water into the lake has increased the volume of water, which will inevitably overflow into the canal. If there is continuous rain or the flood season in the coming summer and autumn, the counties of Tongshan, Pi, Sui, and Suqian will suffer greatly. He has telegraphed a report to the provincial government, requesting that it consult the Shandong provincial government and order Teng County to close the gate quickly.

<h3>Letter from the Embassy in Cuba</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper published a special dispatch from Nanjing on September 12, dated September 11, stating, "Cuba is excluding overseas Chinese, blockading property, and deporting them. Envoy Ling has lodged a protest. The Cuban government has refused to meet with him. Ling has telegraphed to request the remittance of 20,000 yuan as travel expenses for overseas Chinese returning home, but the government has not agreed." After investigation, Cuba is currently in turmoil, and overseas Chinese have suffered some losses, but there is no exclusion, blockade, or deportation. Since the establishment of the new Cuban government, our government has not recognized it, so Envoy Ling has not formally visited any Cuban government agency. As for the request for a remittance of 20,000 yuan, it did not happen. We hereby request your newspaper to make a correction. We would be very grateful. To the Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper, From the Embassy in Cuba, October 24.</p>
<h3>Jiang Re-Orders Sichuan Troops to Vigorously Coordinate and Suppress Bandits; Liu Xiang Orders General Offensive; Xu's Bandits Retreat Entirely North; Xu Yuanquan Returns to Shashi, Proceeding to the Front to Oversee Suppression of He's Bandits</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Xiang's remnant bandits, fleeing eastward from northern Sichuan, attacked and raided Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, and other units successively, like a strong wind sweeping leaves, with unstoppable ferocity. Liu Xiang's defense area was also threatened, and Kaiwan was alarmed for a time, shaking the entire Sichuan. After the Fifth Route Army under Wang Lingji and the Sixth Route Army under Fan Shaozeng received orders to attack, they engaged in bloody battles with the bandit army led by He Wei and others between Kaijiang and Suiding, in the battles of Sanhuikou, Huilongchang, Yongxingchang, and other engagements. Both sides used their main forces to confront each other. The bandits were unsuccessful, and their eastward plan suffered a setback. They retreated with their main force to Luojiangkou between Suixuan, and Fan pursued them, leading to another fierce battle. Liu Xiang, seeing military success, issued a general offensive order on the sixteenth, charging Wang and Fan's armies to advance from Suixuan, Yang Sen to advance from Yingshan, and also ordering Deng Xihou to quickly concentrate at Zhaoguang and join Tian Songyao in an eastward advance to achieve an enveloping effect. It had long been rumored that Suiding and Yingshan had been recovered, but based on the facts, it seems they are still in the hands of the bandits. What has been recovered is only their subordinate territories. Chairman Chiang, based on a telegram presented by the Sichuan Province People's Anti-Bandit Support Association, stating that Wang and Fan's units had been in fierce battles with the bandits for many days and other units had not yet advanced, telegraphed Liu Xiang again, ordering him to immediately relay orders to all armies, to coordinate effectively and suppress the bandits simultaneously, and to avoid waiting and watching, falling into the bandits' plan of defeating them one by one. It is heard that the bandit troops between Suixuan began to retreat entirely north on the eighteenth. Those guarding Pujiaochang have retreated towards Zhongxing and Yangliu, and the baggage and supplies at Yanmen are also moving towards Yixing. The eastern front of the war is gradually becoming calm, and the National Army seems to be able to take the entire territory of Suixuan without a fight. However, the war on the northern front suddenly became tense. On the line of Zhaoguang, Canglang, bandits and Tian's army have been in contact for days, and war clouds are gathering on the banks of the Jialing River. It seems that the bandits, failing to achieve their goals on the eastern front, are directing their entire force northward, intending to take advantage of Deng's army not having arrived to break through Tian's army while it is weak. Tian's units comprise six divisions and five routes, about more than thirty regiments, mostly gathered in Canglang. Although they have suffered repeated setbacks, their morale is very firm, and they know the bandits' tricks very well, so they can still hold on. A few days ago, Tian Songyao stated that if the bandits invade, he will definitely not allow them to cross the defense line, but before Deng's units are concentrated, it will not be easy to launch an isolated offensive. The bandits He Long and Xia Xi, being夹擊 by the Sichuan and Hubei armies, have an even stronger desire to enter Sichuan. They are currently entrenched in Qianli, straddling Sichuan and Hubei, with the intention of invading Yunyang and Fengjie. Liu Xiang has ordered the Sichuan East armies and newly formed teams to strictly block them, preventing them from crossing the Yangtze River and linking up with Xu's bandits. Xu Yuanquan is responsible for overseeing the suppression of these bandits and flew back to Shashi from Hankou on the twentieth, immediately departing for Enshi to督师 (oversee the troops).

<h3>Xuzhou: Tragedy Amidst Paper Money Crisis; Party and Government Establish Paper Money Clearing Office; People Rush to Exchange, Trampling and Injuring Pregnant Woman</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the private paper money crisis in Xuzhou, the party and government authorities have repeatedly sought ways to maintain and clear it. However, the seven combined only established one public exchange office in the Chamber of Commerce. Those exchanging cash were packed like sardines, leading to repeated incidents. Although the party and government authorities recently established a Paper Money Clearing Association, the tragedy of people rushing to exchange cash occurred. Although paper money circulation in the market has eased slightly, public opinion is greatly agitated by the tragedy. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Clearing Paper Money</h3>
<p>The people of Xuzhou have suffered from the poison of paper money for a long time. A thorough ban is the unanimous demand. In the past few years, merchants issuing paper money, whenever facing public criticism, would seek assistance from the administrative authorities, offering a considerable sum of money to maintain the issuance of paper money. Administrative personnel also used this public opinion as a means of reaping benefits. Therefore, although there have been several organizations of financial reorganization committees, the issuance of private paper money continued as before. Now, at the time of the paper money collapse, all sectors advocate a thorough clearing. The county government has invited the county reorganization committee, the first district office, the Chamber of Commerce, and the silver and money industry association to establish a Paper Money Clearing Committee, which began working at the county government office on the nineteenth. Those responsible are County Magistrate She Nianci, Rui Zhenxiang of the county reorganization committee, Chen Xizhe of the first district office, Lan Bohua of the Chamber of Commerce, and Zhang Junchuan of the silver and money industry. The implementation methods are as follows: (1) The seven private money houses, except for Gongyu, which is a joint stock company and is separately cleared by the shareholders, the remaining Chunquan, Bu Xinjie, Yi Zhenxiang, Shi Xingchang, Ju Hechang, and Tian Bao Yu, their existing paper money will be investigated, sealed, and destroyed on a fixed date. (2) The paper money continuously exchanged and collected by each house will be sealed and destroyed daily. (3) The printing plates stored in each money house will be collected, sealed, and stored. (4) External affairs will be handled by the county government, and county government officials will be assigned to keep the case files. Each committee member is already proceeding with the prescribed matters separately. As for the shareholders of Gongyu 銀號, they were also convened by the county government yesterday to discuss. More than forty people attended, and the President of the Chamber of Commerce, Lan Bohua, and Xie You'an from the silver and money industry also attended. Chairman She Nianci ordered each shareholder to bear unlimited liability and quickly raise funds to clear the exchanges, awarding the organization of the Gongyu Clearing Office. Gao Yuru, Zhang Xiangchen, Du Yushan, Li Aitang, Cai Wenzhi, Zhou Jiyu, Li Xingzhou, Chen Zhonghao, Zhuang Shaojiu, and Sun Yipeng were appointed as eleven committee members responsible for clearing. The regulations are: (1) Gongyu's existing receipts and loans will be requested by the county government to be collected, and the floating loans on the account will be collected by the Clearing Office. (2) Shareholders will borrow funds from banks with collateral to issue and exchange paper money, and the Clearing Office will be responsible for negotiation. (3) The existing paper money, approximately 800,000 strings, will be verified by the Clearing Office and publicly destroyed. (4) Uncollected paper money will be uniformly cleared by the Clearing Office, sealed daily, and awaiting destruction. Each committee member has already started handling the matter. Coupled with the lack of cash in the market, the paper money of other money houses, except for Gongyu, has slightly eased in the market these days. However, it is by no means purely trust, but because private paper money has been holding the market for a long time, there is almost no other way to operate. The deeply rooted roots and the severity of the poison can be imagined.</p>
<p>Tragedy of Rushing to Exchange</p>
<p>The Public Exchange Office is located in the Chamber of Commerce. The seven combined only raised several hundred yuan of cash each day, while the paper money outside totaled more than two million. How could this be enough? The exchange time is from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, only four hours temporarily. With seven houses gathered in one place, the people holding paper money came in droves, which was even more insufficient to distribute. In recent days, tragedies have been staged repeatedly. Even with military and police maintaining order and armed suppression on the scene, it is easy to cause incidents. Every day, several members of the public are injured. At noon on the 19th, a pregnant woman surnamed Su, living in the Iron Buddha Temple in Nanguan, came to exchange a one-yuan Gongyu paper money and was knocked down and trampled, fainting. Neighbors rushed to her rescue and poured her with goat's blood before she woke up. However, because she was six months pregnant, her injuries were particularly severe, and she was reported to be in critical condition this morning. Public opinion is in an uproar and has to blame the authorities for their inappropriate measures. They have questioned the Chamber of Commerce. The President of the Chamber of Commerce, Lan Bohua, feeling unfairly blamed on behalf of the money merchants, decided to ask the county government to stop the public exchange and let each money house exchange separately to avoid people gathering and causing another tragedy. This afternoon, the reporter personally went to inspect. It was during the break, and the double doors were tightly closed. Armed military police were patrolling the Chamber of Commerce courtyard with guns. The door was surrounded by wooden fences, and people were shoulder to shoulder and heel to heel in the fences, and some were standing on the wooden fences and on people's shoulders. An old woman surnamed Wang, living on Yunlong Mountain, was squeezed into the wooden fence and was about to faint. She was helped out. The Director of the Telegraph Bureau, Kuang Jingyou, happened to meet her during a visit. Seeing that she was holding a one-yuan Gongyu paper money, Kuang generously paid her two yuan of钞幣 (钞幣) and took the Gongyu paper money, tore it up, and threw it away. The onlookers shouted admiration. Kuang also bought her a car to send her home, otherwise, another tragedy would have occurred. At the moment, society expresses great sympathy for the pregnant woman who was trampled and is in critical condition. They have decided that if the woman unfortunately dies, they will form a Support Association for the Tragedy to demand compensation from the paper merchants. Public sentiment is激昻 (激昻), which is可徽 (可徽). (Twentieth)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Report of Salt Smugglers Shot Dead Verified</h3>
<p>The first team of the eighth district of the Tax Police stationed in Tuolin, at about 7:00 PM the night before, received a secret report that a large number of salt boats, led by salt smugglers, were sailing to間行 (間行) and selling. After receiving the report, the team immediately ordered four policemen to go to key locations to block and guard. After 9:00 PM, a salt boat suddenly stopped inside a corner. Several salt smugglers went ashore to scout and encountered sentry Wang Kaiyin. Wang immediately喝問 (喝問) the password. Unexpectedly, two salt smugglers stepped forward to try to seize the weapons. One bandit immediately took out a sharp knife and stabbed fiercely. For self-defense, Wang immediately fired a warning shot. Wang had already been stabbed in the left arm but was not aware of it. By the time other sentries heard the alarm and rushed over, Wang had fainted and was unconscious. Subsequently, Deputy Team Leader Yu led the police to arrive and carried Wang back for rescue. The next day (21st), it was discovered that a salt smuggler had been shot dead and there was a salt boat. Deputy Team Leader Yu immediately ordered the township police to temporarily guard them and, at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, ordered the police to go to the county court prosecutor's office to request inspection.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Jiangsu Province Water Police Implements Downsizing</h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs is implementing downsizing to reorganize the provincial water police, eliminating the weak and retaining the strong. It has now been decided to change the six major districts into four districts. The first district of Minhang remains the same, with Xu Pucheng as the district chief. The second district of Wuxi and Suzhou are merged into the second district, with the district headquarters located in Suzhou and Wei Zhanyuan as the district chief. The fourth district of Wusong is changed to the third district, with Chi Yaozong as the district chief. The fifth district of Guazhou and the sixth district of Qingjiangpu are merged into the fourth district, with the district headquarters located in Guazhou and Gong Guoliang as the district chief. Each district is divided into four major teams, and each major team has three sub-teams. Each sub-team has three patrol boats and one large boat, which is almost half of the original number. The district headquarters also has a special task force with 60 team members and an investigation team with one team leader, two team members, and thirteen investigators. The above methods were decided by the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Gu Renfa, at a meeting of district chiefs convened in the province. The second district chief, Wei Zhanyuan, returned to Suzhou on the 21st, bringing with him 500 yuan in silver for paying arrears and severance pay. Because the district has a vast territory, governing Changshu, Kunshan, Wujiang, Wuxian, Piaoyang, Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, and other eight counties, it is necessary to establish six major teams. The original police force of the second and third districts was more than 2,000. During the downsizing, about 1,000 people were retained and formed into five major teams. Another guerrilla team was编充 (编充) into one major team. The downsizing must be implemented by the end of this month. At that time, Director Gu will personally depart to each district for point編 (編).</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Shanghai Parricide Captured in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Zhou Chen, a widow from Yancheng, residing at No. 66, Guangzhao Road, Zhabei, Shanghai, next to the Guangdong Guild Hall, is about 40 years old. Having no children, she relies on her late husband's inheritance to collect usury and live. Her husband's elder brother, Zhang Qing, had a son named Tongjiang (also known as Xiao Erzi), who is over 20 years old. Because he coveted Chen's late husband's inheritance, he once litigated in court. As a result, Zhang Qing lost the lawsuit. Therefore, Zhang Qing and his son both hated Chen. The following year, Zhang Qing also passed away, and Tongjiang planned and premeditated, harboring deep resentment towards Chen, eventually leading to a潜伏杀机 (潜伏杀机). At about 4:00 PM on August 4th of this year, while Zhou Chen was washing filthy utensils by the nearby river, he held a kitchen knife and砍 (砍) her face and abdomen three times, causing her to bleed profusely and barely breathe.

Due to the severity of the injuries, she died shortly after. The Shanghai District Court Procurator personally came to騐收殮 (騐收殮) and ordered the arrest of the murderer, but to no avail. Recently, Chen's younger brother, Xue Shi, learned that Tongjiang was hiding in this county. He immediately came to Wuxi to search for him. The day before yesterday (20th) afternoon, he caught a glimpse of Tongjiang watching a play at the Zhenxing Theater on Dongxin Road. He remained silent, left the theater, and reported to the Water Patrol Team Leader Qian Tianzhui. Team Leader Qian personally led the police to the theater and拘獲 (拘獲) Zhou Tongjiang (also known as Xiao Sanzi) and brought him back to the team. Yesterday, he presented him to the county government for questioning and押 (押) him, awaiting the Shanghai District Court to come to Wuxi to提 (提) him.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Parricide Escapes from Prison</h3>
<p>Zhang Bao, a farmer from Yu Dong, concealed poison in food to murder his uncle. After the case was discovered, he was拘獲 (拘獲) and押 (押) by the court. On the 20th, the兇犯 (兇犯) took advantage of the lack of preparedness in the prison, climbed onto the roof, and escaped. The court sent letters to the military and police for恊緝 (恊緝).</p>
<h3>Letter: Letter from Zhenjiang District Court</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Reading your newspaper's report on the 18th of this month about prisoners in Zhenjiang Court going on a hunger strike, it stated that prisoner Xia Yisong suddenly went mad, with excessive nerve刺激 (刺激), and after medical diagnosis, his condition was severe, and there was a danger to his life. Repeated requests were made to transfer him to the hospital for treatment, but the court had no specific measures. All官犯 (官犯) in detention went on a hunger strike from the 16th to request, etc. After investigation, although the warden of the prison reported that prisoner Xia Yisong was indeed ill, the director of the Department of Internal Medicine of the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital was immediately ordered to conduct three diagnoses. His body temperature was 37 degrees Celsius, his pulse was 84 beats per minute, his上下 (上下) was still neat, his breathing was quiet, not喘急 (喘急), and his pupil response was normal. There were no abnormalities in the lungs or heart, and no abnormalities in the abdomen.

Other prisoners did not go on a hunger strike either. In fact, the above report does not conform to the truth and should be corrected. To Shenbao Newspaper, from the Prosecutor's Office of Jiangsu Zhenjiang District Court, November 20th.</p>

<h3>Local News: News from Various Sides After the Fujian Incident; Content of the 民衆 (民衆) Representative Assembly's Clever Telegram; Advice to Chiang and Cai from the No War Association's Ma Telegram; Fujian Groups Telegraphing to Request Maintenance of the Status Quo</h3>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that the Fujian Provincial Rebellion has now become a reality, and the People's Government it organized was formally established last month. The Far East News Agency reporter yesterday learned from various sources the details of what happened before and after. The information obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>People's Representative Assembly</h3>
<p>According to sources, Chen (Mingshu) and Cai (Tingkai) and others have been planning the organization of the new government for a long time. Chen Mingshu's travels between Hong Kong and Fujian were specifically for contacting various parties. After the plan was finalized, he hastily returned to Fujian and incited his subordinates on the morning of the 18th to hold a "National People's Representative Assembly" in Zhangzhou, and resolved to ask Chen, Cai, Li (Jishen), and others to come forward to organize a "People's Government" in the name of the Assembly, and determined that Zhangzhou would be the temporary capital of the government. It is said in the newspaper that the government was established in Fuzhou, which is actually a misreport.</p>
<h3>Main Idea of the Clever Telegram's Content</h3>
<p>On the same day, a clever telegram was also issued in the name of the Assembly. The telegram was telegraphed by the telegraph bureau and printed on oil-paper and sent from other sources. The Min people traveling in Shanghai received a copy of the eight-hundred-word telegram on the previous night (20th). The telegram still advertised both the resistance to Japan and suppression of bandits.</p>
<h3>Re-Issuing the Establishment Telegram</h3>
<p>Chen and others had accepted the request of the People's Representative Assembly on the 18th. Everything was prepared beforehand, so there was no need to exaggerate. They convened a citizens' meeting in Zhangzhou on the morning of the 20th and announced the establishment of the "People's Government." The establishment telegram was sent on the same day. The Nanjing Central Government received the telegram the day before yesterday, and the Shanghai Municipal Government also received it at the same time, but Mayor Wu told reporters that he had not yet received it.</p>
<h3>Saying That Jiang Guangnai Was Detained</h3>
<p>A bizarre rumor was prevalent in the city yesterday, saying that Jiang Guangnai was detained by Chen Mingshu and others. The newspapers had previously reported that the Fujian affairs were actively planned by Chen, Jiang, and Cai. However, when the news of the government's establishment came out, Jiang's name was not included in the organization, which inevitably raised suspicions. Therefore, it was rumored that Jiang had been detained. However, according to the reporter's investigation from another source, this is actually the talk of a nervous person. In fact, Jiang temporarily hid his name due to some relationship.</p>
<h3>Central Government Temporarily Not Sending Troops</h3>
<p>As for the Central Government's response to the Fujian affairs, it issued a telegram to the whole country the day before yesterday, ordering all military and political organs to quickly handle them. However, it is learned that the Central Government has always advocated resolving any previous incidents politically and will never lightly use force, causing suffering to the people. Therefore, in this Fujian incident, it still intends to send personnel to疏解 (疏解) and will not meet with soldiers for the time being.</p>
<h3>Attitude of Central Committee Members Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The reporter yesterday visited Li Liejun, He Shizhen, Sun Jingya, Gui Chongji, and other members of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai and asked them about their attitude towards the Fujian affairs. They all said that none of them had seen the telegram issued by the Fujian side, so they did not fully understand the truth of the Fujian affairs. Before the truth is clear, it is not convenient to express their attitude. They may have something to say in two or three days. As for Madame Chen Bijun, the wife of the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, she arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train from Beijing at about 7:00 AM yesterday. It was reported that Madame Wang came here to visit the members of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai to inquire about their attitude towards the Fujian affairs. However, He, Sun, Gui, and others said when they met with reporters that Madame Wang had not come to visit. Later, the reporter met Madame Wang at Chu Minyi's private residence. Madame Wang only said "I don't know," likely denying the matter.</p>
<h3>Japan Sends Warships to Fujian</h3>
<p>After the Fujian incident occurred, Japan attached great importance to it. Under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, it will send six destroyers from Magong Port to Fuzhou and Xiamen to observe.</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency said that after the Fujian Rebellion was confirmed, the Central Government decided to take severe measures. However, Central Committee member Chen Bijun came to Shanghai to contact the Central Committee members and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The Abolish Civil War League telegraphed Chiang and Cai, advising them to implement their statement of not participating in the civil war and to turn back before it is too late. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chen Bijun Came to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>When the Central Political Committee met the day before yesterday, the members of the Central Committee pushed Central Committee member Chen Bijun to come to Shanghai to contact the Central Committee members staying in Shanghai to deal with the Fujian incident. Chen took the night train from Beijing that night and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>No War Association Sends Ma Telegram</h3>
<p>Since the news of the Fujian Rebellion arrived in Shanghai, the Abolish Civil War League convened a meeting of the standing committee to discuss it. Yesterday afternoon, it sent a telegram advising Chiang and Cai: "Fuzhou Chairman Chiang and Director Cai, Upon receiving the news of the变讯 (变讯), we were shocked. You once made a statement in Shanghai that you would not participate in the civil war. The words are still in our ears, how can you forget your heart? Differences in political views should be resolved politically. Seeking resolution through military means will only make things worse. Moreover, the lost territory of the Eastern Province has not yet been recovered, and a world war is imminent. The people's livelihood in the country is depleted. How can we bear to鬩牆 (鬩牆) in this situation? We dare to ask you to turn back before it is too late, store up strength, and use it against foreign forces. We dare to offer忠告 (忠告). We hope you will adopt it. The Abolish Civil War League Headquarters respectfully, Ma."</p>
<h3>Chen Zhaoying Has Returned to Beijing</h3>
<p>Before the Fujian Rebellion occurred, the Central Government had decided to send Chen Zhaoying and Duan Xipeng to Fujian to investigate and疏解 (疏解). After Chen came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he was about to prepare to go, but learned that the政变 (政变) had been confirmed and that going would be useless, so he stopped going. He returned to Beijing the night before last. As for Duan Xipeng, he never left Beijing.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Telegrams Are Open</h3>
<p>Telegrams between Shanghai and Fujian were interrupted on the evening of the 19th due to the construction of roads and bombing of mountains, which damaged the报線 (报線). Yesterday morning, the报線 (报線) between Jiangshan and Pucheng was repaired. From 10:44 AM, the报機 (报機) connecting to Fuzhou was open and could receive and send telegrams as usual. However, due to strict inspection, the delivery of telegrams is not as fast as before. The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route also flew south as usual yesterday morning. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau did not receive orders to stop remittance transactions to Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places, and continued to handle them as usual. The China News Agency said that Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others in Fujian Province established a separate People's Government, and its telegram was issued on the 20th. The Central Bank's branches in Fuzhou and Xiamen have been taken over by the Fujian side. The naval organizations in Fujian are particularly numerous. The marines stationed in Mawei were disarmed on the 18th. Other state-run transportation and tax revenue organizations are now under the surveillance of the Fujian army. Yesterday, the reporter inquired about the details from various parties and summarized them as follows:</p>
<h3>Central Bank Notes Can Only Be Used to Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>Since the pacification director Cai Tingcuo sent Li Chaoheng and Ye Shaoquan to take over and reorganize the Fuzhou and Xiamen branches of the Central Bank and temporarily suspend business, all Central Bank paper money can no longer circulate in Fujian Province. According to reliable news obtained by the banking sector in Shanghai yesterday, all Central Bank paper money in Fujian Province can only be used to pay national and local taxes, and cannot be circulated in any other way.</p>
<h3>Two Naval Vessels Stationed in Fujian</h3>
<p>There are many naval organizations in Fujian, such as the marines, the naval training camp, the Changmen Fortress, the Xiamen Naval Aviation Office, the Majiang Naval Academy, and the Mawei and Xiamen naval shipyards. Except for the marines stationed in Zhangzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Mindu, and Mawei, the others have fixed locations. The reporter learned the news after the Fujian Rebellion from the naval side in Shanghai yesterday. According to them, the Majiang marines were taken over by the 19th Route Army on the 18th with 2,000 troops. However, the marines stationed there only numbered twenty or thirty, so they were handed over immediately without any incidents. However, the majority of the marines are stationed in Sandu. As for the Xiamen Aviation Office, there are currently about six or seven airplanes, as well as the Changmen Fortress and naval shipyards. As of yesterday, no one had gone to take them over, so Chen Wenlin, the director of the Aviation Office who came to Shanghai, flew back to Xiamen yesterday. Currently, there are only two small warships, Hai Fu and Hai Ning, stationed in Majiang and Xiamen. As for whether the Ministry of Navy needs to send ships there, it is said that it must wait for orders from the Central Government and is not yet necessary. Rumors that Japanese warships are sailing to Fujian and will take action are not credible. In short, the intention is to show off power under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese. Commander Chen Jiliang went to Beijing and has not returned as of yesterday. All Central Government tax revenue agencies in Fujian have been in the hands of the Fujian government since the 19th. The naval coastal radio station established by the Fujian People's Government in Wusong received a telegram yesterday and forwarded it to the Gaochang Temple Headquarters. The content mentioned resisting Japan and suppressing Communists, but the original text was not seen.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ships Not Detained</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-run transportation organization. It has a branch office in Fuzhou and an agency in Xiamen. The reporter feared that the Fujian side would detain ships, so he specifically met with Chen Weiqing, the general affairs section chief of the company. According to him, only the Taishun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is sailing to Fujian. It is currently en route and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. It is true that the Central Bank's branch offices in Fujian have been taken over, but there is no definite news about the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's branch office. The director of the Fujian branch office came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and has now transferred to Hangzhou, so everything will be known after the branch office returns. In short, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's property in Fujian only includes a few branch office buildings, land, vacant land, four warehouses, and docks, which are few in number. Whether航輪 (航輪) will call at Fujian and Xiamen again in the future is still under consideration by the company. However, as of now, none of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's航輪 (航輪) have been detained by the Fujian side.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Airplanes As Usual</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong route has just been completed. The entire route has seven stops, and Fuzhou and Xiamen are both landing stops. After the sudden change in the Fujian situation, the company, being a commercial civilian aviation organization, is entirely for business purposes. Therefore, according to a staff member in the company yesterday, the Fujian affairs have no impact on the Shanghai-Guangdong route. The flight from Shanghai to Guangdong yesterday morning still took off as usual at 6:05 AM and landed at the Fuzhou and Xiamen stops as usual. The flight from Guangdong to Shanghai will arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>The New New News Agency said that all the Shanghai-based Fujian business firms believe that the sudden changes in the Fujian situation have a significant impact on merchants' economies. They specifically convened the 45th general assembly at the Sanshan Guild Hall yesterday afternoon. It was decided to telegraph the Fuzhou Chamber of Commerce to maintain the status quo. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Attending Businesses</h3>
<p>Yesterday's attendees included Dechang, Chen Dunj, Zhao Chengchang, Hengchun, Taikang, Xiehe, Lin Zaiji, Shuntaisen, Xiecheng, Xinyuan, Chen Bingji, Huang Hehe, Rong Yutai Zheng Zhenji, Huang Fengji, Xianxin, Yuansen, Fang Yicheng, Fukangle, Helong, Xinfu Jin, Lin Qingji, Henglong, Shi Shaoji, Jiufu, Hongwenge, Chen Fulong, Jiankang, Zhuang Jinji, Lin Shunlai, Lin Shengcang, Wu Taiheng, Lin Yinglian, Huang Yanji, and other business representatives, totaling over forty people. Huang Yufu was publicly elected as chairman, and Huang Renfang as the recorder.</p>
<h3>Representatives Express Opinions</h3>
<p>After the formal greetings, the chairman reported, roughly stating that today's newspapers reported changes in the Fujian situation, and the situation was serious, which had a major impact on the economy of our merchants. Therefore, a representative assembly was specially convened to discuss remedial measures to maintain commerce. He hoped that all representatives would express their opinions, etc. After the chairman's report, the representatives expressed their opinions one after another, and then a public decision was made. It was unanimously agreed that economic relations are the lifeblood of commerce. A telegram should be sent to the Fuzhou County Chamber of Commerce to maintain normalcy and prevent panic. Huang Renwu was appointed to draft the telegram. The meeting adjourned at around 4 pm.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Fujian Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reporter transcribed the original telegram as follows: Publicly acknowledge the Fuzhou County Chamber of Commerce. Reading the newspaper reports the changes in the Fujian situation, but the truth here is unclear. However, economic relations are the lifeblood of commerce. Please maintain normalcy and avoid panic. Sincerely, San Shan Guild Hall of South Shanghai, San Shan Funing Guild Hall of North Shanghai, Ma Yin.</p>
<h3>The Impact of Shanghai-Fujian Commerce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Xinxin News Agency specially inquired with a person in charge of a Fujian merchant in Shanghai about the recent commercial situation between Shanghai and Fujian. According to the person, the loss suffered by Fujian merchants in Shanghai after the changes in the Fujian situation was quite large. This is because many Shanghai merchants have been remitting funds to Fujian Province to purchase goods in recent days. Unexpectedly, with a sudden change in the political situation, the purchased goods were mostly blocked due to transportation issues and could not be shipped to Shanghai. They will have to wait for the political situation to stabilize before shipping can resume. However, the funds for purchasing goods have already been remitted, and the goods cannot arrive as scheduled. The significant impact on their economy can be imagined. The reporter also learned from another source that after the political changes in Fujian, the commercial transactions between Shanghai and Fujian, up to yesterday, included both Fujian merchants wiring to Shanghai to continue purchasing goods and wiring to stop shipment. This shows one aspect of the chaotic commercial situation in the province. If the political situation does not develop further, the shipping between Shanghai and Fujian is likely to be interrupted.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Stop Going to Fujian</h3>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, five overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia, including Li Shuanghui, Li Tiemin, He Baoren, Huang Xiaoyan, and Liu Weiming, were originally scheduled to take the Jiesheng Wheel from Shanghai to Fujian yesterday to investigate the political, economic, educational, and social conditions of the province. They also planned to meet with Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Chen Mingshu, etc., to contribute their opinions on Fujian affairs as private individuals, hoping for realization. Unexpectedly, the situation in Fujian has worsened, so the delegation decided to change its itinerary and will stop going to Fujian. They plan to stay in Shanghai for a while and then return directly to Singapore. It is also learned that Li Shuanghui, a representative of the delegation and a veteran of overseas Chinese in our country, took an early train from Shanghai to Beijing yesterday morning to pay a visit to Executive Yuan President Wang and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Chairman Chen Shuren for some matters.</p>
<h3>Soong Ching Ling's Statement</h3>
<p>Last night, Ms. Soong Ching Ling issued a signed statement to various newspapers, stating, "All news reports stating that I am related to the recent changes in Fujian, and even more absurd rumors that I have gone to Fujian, are all clumsy and malicious slanders against me."</p>
<p>"I solemnly declare that I will never have any relationship with any warlords or political groups, whether now or in the future. My position remains unchanged."</p>
<h3>Italian Envoy to Go to Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>To Present Credentials to Chairman Lin</p>
<p>After Italian Minister Bossi arrived in Shanghai last month, he went to Beijing several times to pay respects to the diplomatic authorities. Chairman Lin happened to be in Fujian sweeping tombs and had not returned, so he was unable to present his credentials. It is now learned that Chairman Lin is returning to Beijing to take office, so he has specially scheduled to go to Beijing tonight to meet with Chairman Lin tomorrow morning (the 23rd) to present his credentials. After hearing the news, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the railway bureau to attach a special car for the Italian Minister to ride to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Central Factory Inspection Office Sends Cheng Haifeng to Shanghai to Investigate Major Factories Starting Today</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Central Factory Inspection Office, various inspection plans have been actively drafted. Recently, in order to understand the factory conditions in various developed industrial areas so that they can be used as references when drafting various plans, Inspection Section Chief Cheng Haifeng was specially sent to Shanghai. Cheng arrived in Shanghai on the 20th and immediately went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to meet with Tian Heqing, the director of the Factory Inspection Section, to cooperate in the investigation. According to Tian Heqing's statement to the Central News Agency reporter, Cheng will be accompanied by personnel from the bureau starting today to visit larger factories, staying for about three or four days, and then going to Hangzhou, Wuxi, Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, and other places. Cheng's investigation of factory conditions in various places is because the Central Factory Inspection Office will draft various regulations to improve factory safety and sanitation equipment. These regulations will have a factual basis, so it will not be difficult to implement them in the future. Cheng will also investigate the factory conditions in various treaty ports to be able to take into account the actual needs, distinguish between urgency, and decide the order in which local factory inspection offices are established.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Pay Interest on Loans</h3>
<p>The two batches of loans that expired on May 18 of last year for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and on the 17th of this month for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, totaling £116,000 in principal for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and £37,593 15s in principal for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, have now been decided to pay interest first. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway's interest, including bank commission, totals £69,774, equivalent to $1,076,032.77 in national currency. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's interest, including bank commission, totals £11,278 2s 6d, equivalent to $170,927.71 in national currency. The total of $1,249,960.48 in national currency has already been withdrawn and allocated from the special reserve fund on November 6.</p>
<h3>Mr. Bissell Talks About Sino-Philippine International Aviation Not Being Stopped Due to Obstruction by the Philippine Parliament</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Bissell, the American director of China National Aviation Corporation, who recently went to the Philippines on behalf of Pacific American Airways, a subsidiary of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, to negotiate air routes, returned to Shanghai by plane from Guangzhou on Sunday. Yesterday (20th), he stated that the Philippine Legislative Assembly's refusal to grant Pacific American Airways the franchise for internal aviation on the island is not enough to hinder Pacific American Airways' Sino-Philippine international aviation plan. Approximately as soon as suitable aircraft are built, passengers can travel from Hong Kong to Manila. As for the Philippine Parliament's rejection of the franchise proposal, it is because they fear that the already established small companies in the Philippines will be oppressed after Pacific American Airways joins the internal aviation business on the island. Therefore, we can still fly from Hong Kong to Manila and land in Northern Luzon to refuel. It is anticipated that the Philippine Legislative Assembly's refusal to allow the company to open additional branch routes within the Philippine Islands will not have a significant impact.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also heard that the test flight results of the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangzhou air route organized by China National Aviation Corporation are very satisfactory. Approximately within the next week, passenger service can begin. As for when air service between Hong Kong and Manila can be started, Mr. Bissell did not give a definite answer, only saying that it is expected that it will take at least one year to build suitable facilities in the United States.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Reply to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegram: Suppressing Bandits is the Natural Duty of the Military and People</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a reply telegram from Chairman Chiang yesterday, which stated: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, for the business community's anti-bandit propaganda meeting, I have received your telegram. The Red bandits have been rampaging in Jiangxi and Fujian for a long time without being suppressed, causing great suffering to the people. I feel deeply pained. Killing thieves and protecting the people is the duty of the military. I am deeply grateful for your remote condolences and have already conveyed them to the officers and soldiers at the front to encourage them. I hereby send a telegram in reply to express my thanks. Chiang Chung-cheng."</p>

<h3>Preparing to Organize a National Grain Production and Sales Organization; Preparatory Meeting to be Held in Shanghai on the 6th of Next Month</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened a grain meeting of eight provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Shanghai, in Jiangxi, representatives from Shanghai, Wu Huanru, Gu Xinyi, etc., suggested organizing a grain production and sales cooperative organization to regulate national food supply and prevent the dumping of foreign rice. After the proposal was passed by the entire body, the representatives from Shanghai were appointed to be responsible for planning the organizational outline and capital budget of the production and sales organization. After the plans were drafted, they were jointly submitted to Chairman Chiang for review and approval. Therefore, it was decided to convene representatives from various provinces and cities in Shanghai on December 6 to hold the first preparatory meeting. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Directive</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, and others received a directive from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters yesterday, which stated: "Your submitted document, regarding the draft outline of the grain production and sales cooperation method and the proposed Article 2, regarding how to borrow and allocate the one million yuan allocated by the government, is hereby requested for review and instruction, is hereby acknowledged. The submitted document and the outline of the method have been noted. The seven articles of the draft outline of the grain production and sales cooperation method, with one million yuan to be raised by commercial firms in various places and one million yuan to be borrowed from the government with interest, are generally feasible, and it is stipulated that the one million yuan allocated by the Central Government shall be guaranteed principal and interest by the commercial party, which can be approved. You should immediately follow the outline of the method, stipulate the various items, and organize them in a practical manner, and quickly collect the one million yuan in commercial shares and report it to this headquarters for responsible application. Government banks should borrow or overdraft the full amount at interest to facilitate coordination. The outline of the method is kept for reference. This order."</p>
<h3>Convening the First Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the representatives from Shanghai sent telegrams to the representatives from various provinces, which stated: "Regarding the preparation for the establishment of a grain production and sales cooperative organization, the outline of the method has been submitted to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Nanchang for review and approval (the directive is as mentioned above). It has been decided to hold the first preparatory meeting in Shanghai on December 6. We sincerely hope that your representative will come to Shanghai to attend the meeting and jointly discuss the progress. We hereby send this letter and hope that you will reply in advance. Respectfully, (Guangdong) Wen Zhongqi, (Zhejiang) Wang Zhengying, (Hubei) Jia Shiyi, Jiang Han Luo, (Hebei) Shi Jinghuan, Ji Hua, (Hunan) Zhang Kailian, Tan Changkai, (Jiangsu) Dong Guangfu, Tong Yumin, (Anhui) Yuan Fen, (Henan) Xu Daochun, (Jiangxi) Zhu Huaibing, Gong Wensui."</p>
<h3>Internal Content of the Organizational Method</h3>
<p>According to Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Soybean and Rice Trade Association, speaking to a Dagong News reporter, the organization of the grain production and sales cooperation organization is as follows: (1) Each province will send one representative to establish a board of directors, and a manager will be mutually elected from the directors to handle all matters; (2) Each provincial and municipal government will send one representative to establish a supervisory board to supervise the affairs of the board of directors; (3) The head office will be located in Shanghai, and branch offices will not be established in other provinces. The head office will directly send personnel to contact the purchase and sale of grain in various places; (4) The capital for grain production and sales will total 10 million yuan, with 2 million yuan as working capital and 8 million yuan as bank collateralized working capital; (5) It will be named the China Grain Transportation and Marketing Company, and the draft articles of association will be drafted in accordance with the Limited Company Organization Law.</p>
<h3>Production, Sales, and Transportation Methods</h3>
<p>Six provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, are the national rice-producing regions. South China's Guangdong, Fujian, North China's Tianjin, and Beiping are all non-rice-producing regions. However, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have dense populations, and the grain produced each year can only supply consumption within the province. Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have the most abundant production, but because transportation is difficult and supply and demand are uneven, Fujian and Guangdong provinces use foreign rice. The previous eight-province grain meeting discussed this in detail, and Chairman Chiang was responsible for suggesting that the government order the national railways and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other land and water transportation to reduce freight rates and other miscellaneous fees for grain.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order to Facilitate Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>In order to increase rice prices and relieve rural areas, the Ministry of Railways sent a telegram to the two railways, which stated: "The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus have read the micro-telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Nanchang, which stated that the most important principle of the grain meeting's resolution to increase rice prices and relieve rural areas is to eliminate obstacles, facilitate transportation, reduce grain transportation prices, and promote sales. It is hereby telegraphed to you that whenever a request to transport rice is received, you must give priority to allocating vehicles, reducing transportation procedures, in order to ensure smooth grain transportation, increase rice prices, and achieve the effect of relieving rural areas. You must comply with this. Minister Gu Mengyu, printed."</p>
<h3>Liu Hongsheng Reports on China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Affairs, With Slight Differences From Yesterday's Newspaper</h3>
<p>The General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a letter to this newspaper, which stated: "To the gentlemen of the editorial department, I am writing respectfully. Today, your newspaper published an article entitled "Liu Hongsheng Reports That the Future of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is Optimistic," which stated that commemorative weeks were held, employees were notified to gather at the bureau, and the Economic Committee decided to allocate a large amount of money to repay the old debt of HSBC first. These statements are not in accordance with what I said. Even when I am unable to attend the commemorative week due to reasons, the employees also participate as a whole. I did not know about the gathering. The news reported is not entirely accurate. Please correct it in a prominent place based on this letter. I am grateful for your assistance. Respectfully, Liu Hongsheng."</p>
<h3>Electrical Workers Follow Advice, Resume Work in Full This Morning; Union Issues a Declaration of Resuming Work With Pain</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News, the electrical workers' strike in this city has been temporarily resolved after several mediation efforts by Fei Xindun and Du Yuesheng. All workers, in order to safeguard social security and obey the advice of leaders from all walks of life, have decided to resume work in full at the factory starting this morning. All demands will be discussed further after resuming work. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also issued a statement to all walks of life. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Union's Notice of Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>The Strike Committee of the Water and Electricity Industry Union of the Fourth District issued a notice of resumption of work yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the notice, this time, all comrades of our union, in accordance with legal procedures, went through running around and negotiation to conduct a slowdown strike warning in order to demand the consolidation of the guarantee of deserved rights. Due to the slowdown strike warning, they were forced to strike, which lasted for nearly two months. During these nearly two months, the spirit of hardship of all comrades has not been sympathized with by the company authorities. However, enthusiastic social leaders and the Chinese directors and the president and chief inspector in charge of municipal affairs have fully recognized that all comrades of our union are elements who have a strong sense of reason, who love public safety and overcome anger, and that the rights fought for by all comrades of our union are indeed created by previous labor and have been recognized and promised by the Bureau of Works and the American Foreign Power Company that took over the Electric Power Company. The facts have also been announced to society. The debate on right and wrong is extremely clear. Therefore, it is now decided, on November 22, under the advice of leaders such as Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Kui Yanfang, and Cai Futang, to resume work with pain in order to safeguard social public safety and public interests. Regarding the method of guaranteeing deserved rights, we will quietly wait for the enthusiastic mediating Chinese directors and leaders to properly discuss it again after the resumption of work. Therefore, this notice is issued to all comrades to follow it consistently. It is greatly hoped."</p>
<h3>Issuing a Declaration of Resuming Work</h3>
<p>The Water and Electricity Industry Union of the Fourth District issued a declaration of resuming work with pain, which stated: "Since our electrical workers' union was forced to conduct a slowdown strike, it has been 54 days. All our workers deeply know the importance of the electrical industry to social security, and we have always sought a solution through proper channels, and we have never dared to overstep the boundaries and affect social order. Past facts should be recognized by people from all walks of life. Now, the company authorities, urged by public opinion, and with the mediation of Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Kui Yanfang, and other gentlemen, have begun negotiations and decided on the prerequisites for resuming work. Although this method is not as expected by everyone, the sincerity of the gentlemen's enthusiastic mediation is enough to make people grateful and weep. In order to accept the mediator's intentions and safeguard public safety, it has been decided to resume work with pain this morning. In addition to representing all workers in expressing thanks to people from all walks of life and to gentlemen such as Du, Yu, Xu, Wang, Lin, and Kui, we will make efforts in the future with the original intention of serving the community. I hereby announce a few words, hoping for your understanding."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Municipal Government to Return</h3>
<h3>The Wartime Advances of Jiangwan Businessmen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Municipal Government, which stated: "Regarding the submission of a request based on the facts, on the 18th of this month, a letter from the Jiangwan Branch Office of the affiliated association stated that during the January 28th Incident, this office, together with party and government agencies and various groups, organized the Jiangwan Temporary Security Committee to facilitate supply and maintain security. At that time, we borrowed and advanced funds from various businesses for application, totaling $3,494.96. This was registered with the Municipal Government by the municipal commissioner of this district in March of last year, requesting allocation and return. Later, we received instructions, roughly stating that we should wait for the summary of the case and forward it to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for verification. However, two years have passed, and there is no news. Various businesses have been coming to the office to urge the return of the advances, which is very difficult to answer. Therefore, in September of this year, we received a letter from the office of the municipal commissioner of this district, convening the relevant agencies and groups to open a meeting and decide on three measures, which were also submitted to the Municipal Government for review. Unexpectedly, two months have passed, and there has been no approval. At this time, the end of the year is approaching, and the disasters are after the calamity. The meeting of merchants and markets is sluggish. The expectations of the various businesses for the return of the advances are like hunger and thirst. If proper plans are not made, it will be impossible to respond if something happens in the future, and the fundraising of other donations and leases will be even more difficult to start. We have specially prepared a document to apply, hoping that you will forward it to the Municipal Government for assistance. If it can be returned as soon as possible, the business difficulties can be relieved, and the reputation can be maintained, which will not only be the fortune of the local area. Upon arrival, it was found that this advance was purely for maintaining local security during wartime. At that time, the business community raised this amount for the official, which was no different from ordinary debt. After the situation stabilized, there would eventually be a day of repayment. Two years have passed, and there is still no news of debt repayment. The feeling of anxiety is naturally unavoidable. The three repayment methods discussed are indeed a last resort to seek this remedy in order to alleviate the urgency of self. It is reasonable to record the three original resolutions and submit them to your office for adoption and implementation. A quick approval will be a public convenience."</p>
<h3>China Factory Union Opens Manufacturers' Representative Meeting Yesterday; More Than Seventy Representatives From Various Factories Attend; Deciding on the Date of the Lottery and Other Proposals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Zone National Goods Movement Conference, organized by the China National Products Manufacturers Federation, will open on December 1.

After the formal greetings, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss the various proposals as follows: (1) The conference decided to open on December 1, please decide on the date of the lottery. It was resolved that it would be held at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month at the union's headquarters in Qinghefang, W马路. (2) Please decide on the daily viewing hours of the conference. It was resolved that the doors would open at 9:00 AM and close at 9:00 PM. (3) Please decide on the publicity method. It was resolved that the committee would formulate a plan and submit it to the next representative meeting for discussion. (4) Discuss the electricity and fire in the conference venue. It was resolved to leave it to the next representative meeting for discussion. (5) Nominate committee members to assist in handling the affairs of the conference. It was resolved that the list of nominees would be distributed by the union, and the next representative meeting would elect them. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Assessment Committee Changes Members</h3>
<p>Mr. A.P. Nazer, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Assessment Committee, has resigned. The Municipal Council has invited Mr. Harold Porter to continue to serve in this position. Mr. Porter has agreed.</p>
<h3>Heze County Telegraphed to Request Continued Winter Relief</h3>
<p>Due to the severe floods in Heze, Shandong, the Chinese Relief Society, together with the Yellow River Flood Relief Association, raised 70,000 yuan, 5,000 sets of cotton clothing, and a large number of medicines, etc., and publicly appointed Li Yunmen to carry out the relief efforts. However, there are more than 100,000 flood victims in the area, and the funds are insufficient to provide relief to all of them. The association recently received a telegram from Qin Jian, etc., of the Heze County Flood Relief Association, stating that the relief funds, cotton clothing, medicines, etc., donated by your association were distributed impartially by Li Yunmen, who did not spare any effort, and the flood victims shared the benefits and were deeply grateful. However, as the winter season is approaching, relief is urgently needed. We earnestly request the continued issuance of benevolent aid to expand the scope of salvation, and we also request Li Yunmen to continue to handle the matter to make use of his experience. We are immensely grateful, etc. After receiving the telegram, the association deeply understood the difficult situation of the flood victims in Heze, but was unable to provide further assistance due to financial exhaustion. It is found that natural disasters and man-made calamities have occurred in our country in recent years, without any place being spared, and they are becoming increasingly severe.

<h3>Wang Shengrong Dies From Serious Injuries; Two Gangsters Escorted to Court for Interrogation; Police Lawyer States the Circumstances of the Shooting; Many Accomplices Still at Large and Not Captured</h3>
<p>Wang Shengrong, a gangster from Ningbo, 23 years old, lived with his concubine, Fu Genjin (also known as Ah Liu) from Suzhou, in the rear building of No. 1 Chongshanfang, Dengtuo Road. They specialized in armed gangs going out to rob, and Fu was in charge of smuggling firearms. They committed many crimes. In the morning, Chinese detective Ke Zhang of the Huishi Police Department learned of Wang's whereabouts and reported to the head of the detective team. Together with Chinese Detective Chief Shao Jingfan, Detective Liang Yuliang, Western Detective Latuo, and Mitde, they broke down the door and entered the address. Because Wang attempted to resist, he was shot by the Western Detective.</p>
<h3>Shooting Injury</h3>
<p>Wang and Fu were apprehended on the spot, and a handgun with twenty-two bullets was seized.  A fellow accomplice, Zhu Liangfa, from Ningbo, was subsequently captured. They were taken to the police station. Except for Wang Shengrong, who was sent to the Public Works Department Hospital due to his injuries, the rest were detained separately.  These details were previously reported in this newspaper.  It is now learned that Wang Shengrong's injuries were critical, and despite medical treatment, he died at 11 p.m. that evening. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was transported to the mortuary on Avenue Foch for examination.  Yesterday morning, the thief, Fu Gengjin, and Zhu Liangfa were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court, requesting permission for their detention for further investigation.  According to police station lawyer Wang Yaotang, at 6:55 a.m. yesterday, the police station received information that</p>
<h3>Bandits Hideout</h3>
<p>bandits were hiding in the back room of No. 1 Chongshan Fang, Dengtu Road. Chinese and foreign detectives went to arrest them. Upon entering the room, they saw two people lying under a quilt.  The detectives drew their guns and ordered them not to move. However, the man lying on the outer bed suddenly reached under his pillow as if to grab something.  The detectives ordered him to stop, but he did not comply. Fearing an accident, for self-defense, the foreign detective, Latour, fired one shot. However, he did not stop his movement.  He then fired two more shots. At the same time, the detective stepped forward and pulled back the quilt, revealing a man and a woman (Wang Shengrong and Fu Gengjin).  They were immediately arrested. Wang was shot twice, once in the chest and once in the arm, and was bleeding profusely.  Under the pillow, they found</p>
<h3>Live Ammunition Handgun</h3>
<p>a handgun containing six bullets. Under the bedding, they found four and a half ounces of red pills. In the drawer, they found sixteen bullets. A moment later, an old woman rushed in and was also arrested at the time.  She was also taken to the police station. Except for Wang, who was sent to the hospital for treatment, it was learned that the old woman was Wang's mother, named Wang Zhao, who came to see her son after hearing the news. Since she was not involved, she was released. As for the defendant, Zhu Liangfa, he went to Wang's place to borrow money at 11 a.m. and was detained by the stationed detectives. According to Zhu's statement at the police station, he went to Wang's place yesterday to borrow money. However, Fu Gengjin proved that Zhu had also</p>
<h3>Participated in Robbery</h3>
<p>and received a share of silver dollars, so he was detained. Later, the detectives went to the hospital to question the injured thief, Wang Shengrong. According to Wang, the handgun belonged to Yan Chunfu, who was on the run. Yan lived at No. 48, Lane 912, East-West Huade Road. When detectives went to investigate, Yan had already moved elsewhere around 8 a.m. When the Shanghai Moving Company's report was found, it was learned that Yan had moved to No. 180, Tangshan Road. However, when they arrived at Tangshan Road, the furniture was there, but Yan was nowhere to be found and could not be arrested. It is believed that he had</p>
<h3>Fled Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>It has been verified that the handgun seized in this case was used within the past week, but the specific case has not yet been determined. Furthermore, accomplices Chen Xinggui and Zhu Mapi are still at large. Therefore, a request has been made for permission to detain them. In her interrogation, Fu Gengjin confessed that she met Wang during the Shanghai war and lived with him at No. 1 Chongshan Fang. Wang was unemployed. Around September of last year, she went to Chen Xinggui's place at Room 12 of the Central Hotel in Xiaodongmen and obtained the handgun, which she brought back and gave to Wang. Until March or April of this year, she twice saw Wang and Yan Chunfu leave together and return several hours later, carrying</p>
<h3>Fur Coats and Clothing</h3>
<p>When I asked them where the clothes came from, they said, "You wouldn't understand. We took them from the road." She knew nothing else. As for Zhu Lianggui, she saw Wang give him five dollars and also give him clothes to pawn. When questioned, Zhu denied being a thief. Judge Xue Lanru examined the confessions and ordered that Fu and Zhu be detained for seven days for further investigation. Meanwhile, the prosecutor's office of the Special Court appointed prosecutor Diao Chengtang to inspect the mortuary and examine Wang Shengrong's body. After ascending the court, he questioned Fu Gengjin briefly and ruled that the deceased, Wang Shengrong, died from a gunshot wound to the chest sustained while still alive. The body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Detectives in Disguise Bust a Gambling Den in Pudong, Arresting Eleven Gambling and Drug Offenders; Gambling Paraphernalia and Opium Pipes Confiscated for Investigation</h3>
<p>Sha Jinggui, a well-known gangster from Pudong, 28 years old, from Chongming, started a gambling den in February of this year by colluding with local gamblers such as Gu Zhengquan. It was located inside No. 29, Qiu Family Wooden Bridge, east of Yangjing Town, Pudong. It served as a gambling venue and a "swallows' nest." The front of the house was used for gambling games such as dice, pai gow, poker, and mahjong, attracting ignorant men and women to gamble all night long and profiting by skimming. The back of the house was an opium den and a red pill den, providing addicts with their fix. The gambling venue had snack stalls, fruit stalls, tea and wheat stalls, and small wine shops on both sides, on a large scale with all kinds of gambling equipment available. At night, the lights shone brightly, making it look like a painting. The nearby residents all regarded the place as a trap. Recently, disputes arose among the gamblers over the distribution of loot, causing disturbances. Detectives Shen Wenda and Qiu Shuxian of the City Public Security Bureau's Detective Team learned about it and reported the information to Captain Lu Ying, who in turn reported it to Director Wen Hongen. Wen, upon receiving the report, immediately issued an order instructing Captain Lu to send a large number of detectives, including Detective Foremen Chen Guangyan and Li Xiaobao, and Ling Tianpeng, along with six police officers from the bureau's Police Brigade, all in disguise. At around 11 p.m. the night before, they secretly crossed the river to the gambling den at No. 29, Qiu Family Wooden Bridge, east of Yangjing Town, Pudong, and surrounded it. The detectives disguised themselves as gamblers and successively infiltrated the gambling den. The gamblers at each table were shouting and cheering excitedly. They suddenly shouted, "Grab them!" The gamblers were shocked and desperately tried to escape by jumping out of windows and over walls. The gambling boss, Sha Jinggui from Chongming, and Gu Zhengquan from Pudong, as well as gamblers Xu Futao, Zhu Amao, Xu Fugun, Xi Sanmao, Zhang Musheng, Zhang Quange, Zhang Falang from Chongming, Wang Erlang, Wang Xiaojiang, and a total of eleven gamblers and drug offenders were arrested on the spot. A gambling cylinder, several dice, three decks of playing cards, four sets of mahjong tiles, a set of pai gow tiles, three opium pipes and red pill pipes, twenty-two dollars in opium gambling money, thirty-six cents in small coins, and chips were seized. They were all taken back to the team. Under interrogation, all the suspects confessed to gambling, smoking opium, and taking red pills. Captain Lu believed that the case involved gambling, skimming, and operating an opium den, which was illegal. He ordered that the eleven suspects and the gambling and drug paraphernalia be sent to the Third Section for legal action.</p>
<h3>International Sleeping Car Changed to Through Train</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus received a telegraphed instruction from the Ministry of Railways stating that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway had inquired about the international sleeping car company's sleeping cars, which were restricted by contract from being attached to through trains jointly operated by Shanghai and Pingpu. The Ministry had stipulated that these sleeping cars should be temporarily attached to passenger trains 1 and 2 of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The Pingjin section would be connected to passenger trains 5 and 6 of the Beining Railway. Orders were issued to comply with these instructions last month. It is now found that passenger trains 1 and 2 of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have been changed to direct trains to Pingpu. All sleeping cars of the aforementioned international sleeping car company should be attached to passenger trains 1 and 2 of the Tianjin-Pukou through trains and should no longer be connected by passenger trains 5 and 6 of the Beining Railway. You are to inform the Bureau. Minister Gu Mengyu, Seal of Xiaolian. The Bureau has forwarded the instructions to the Transportation Department for compliance.</p>
<h3>Seafarer Examination Moved to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation previously held a seafarer examination in Beijing in October. The China Marine Engineers' Association petitioned the Ministry, stating that it was inconvenient for seafarers to travel to Beijing for the examination due to wartime conditions. They requested that the examination be moved to Shanghai. The Ministry replied that the request was well-founded and approved it for consideration. The Ministry's Order No. 2395 and member Chuan Abao of the Association stated that the examination would be held in Shanghai on January 24, 1934. The examination location has been changed accordingly.</p>

<h3>Cuihua Company Donates Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations' Huang Disaster Relief Association received a letter from the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, along with a donation of 350 yuan from the Cuihua Card Company for charitable purposes.

However, the nature of the ink is such that it may dry out and decompose into waste if stored permanently.

<h3>Zhu Ziqiao and Others Visit the Mental Hospital</h3>

Since its opening, it has achieved remarkable results. Yesterday afternoon, Zhu Ziqiao, Yan Mengfan, Shao Daren, and others visited the hospital together. Zhu said that patients with mental illness should be treated with tranquility. The hospital site should be in a remote location. It is a pity that financial problems are difficult to solve and it is not easy to set up. Today, the facilities of your hospital are quite complete, and the location is quiet in the midst of the bustling city. Director Gu, in his twilight years, is able to work tirelessly and is enthusiastic about charity, which is very commendable. Gu politely declined to comment. Zhu and others said that patients with mental illness are the most miserable people with illnesses and that treatment is extremely difficult, and they praised the hospital repeatedly. They then took their leave and departed.</p>

<h3>Haijingbo Circus to Leave Shanghai in a Week</h3>
<p>The Haijingbo Circus, currently performing in Shanghai, is scheduled to set sail for India in just one week. Counting back, the troupe has already been in Shanghai for seven weeks. During this time, thousands of spectators have flocked to see the show daily, making it a grand spectacle. It's no easy task to transport such a large circus all the way from Europe to the East, but Haijingbo resolutely undertook it, believing that the Far East tour would be highly profitable. Today, business is indeed very good. With the weather turning colder, the troupe uses large stoves to burn in the tents before each performance, making the air inside exceptionally warm. Recently, the circus clowns have added new tricks to entertain the audience, and Auden's mixed animal show has added two new and amazing performances, which are quite spectacular. Its famous zoo attracts many visitors, open daily from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Tickets are priced at five jiao for adults and two jiao for children. Animal feeding takes place every day at 11:00 AM, except on Mondays.</p>
<h3>Pudong: Electrical Company Expands Power Supply; Extends Lines to Zhoupu Town in Nanhui County; Supplies Daming Electrical Company for Resale</h3>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company extended its lines to Beicai Town and Zhangjiangzha Town in Nanhui County in April of this year to supply electricity to Huibei Electric Company for distribution to households. It has been half a year since then, and the results have been remarkable. In rural towns and villages, modern facilities of all kinds are lacking, but electricity is the first to take root. Not only is the supply plentiful and the pressure sufficient, but the lines crisscross the area, providing electricity day and night, which is particularly noteworthy. Therefore, since Huibei Electric Company started receiving electricity, it has been warmly welcomed by local people, resulting in a surge in users and a thriving business. Moreover, its engineering operations and management are coordinated and cooperate with Pudong Electric Company, so its operations are well-managed and can serve as a model for rural power plants. Zhoupu Town, a prosperous commercial center in the vicinity, is second to none among the towns in Nanhui County. The existing Daming Electric Company has a generator that is too small to meet the demand, and it uses direct current, which cannot transmit voltage over long distances. Seeing the success of Huibei Electric Company in purchasing and reselling electricity, it has also voluntarily stopped generating electricity and requested Pudong Electric Company to supply it. After repeated consultations, a draft contract of 19 articles has been agreed upon, which has been submitted by Pudong Electric Company to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and forwarded to the Municipal Government, which has instructed its approval. A formal signing will take place in the next few days. Pudong Electric Company will initially be responsible for supplying a maximum demand of 200 kilowatts, and then gradually increase it year by year to meet the needs of expansion. After the contract is signed, Pudong Electric Company will lay high-voltage lines eastward from Sanlin Town along the Shangnan Long-Distance Bus Road directly to Zhoupu Town, first installing two 60-kilowatt transformers. It is estimated that the project can be completed and the electricity supplied within two months.</p>
<h3>Jiang Xiaojian Invents Ding-Yi Style Coal-Saving Stove</h3>
<p>Artist Jiang Xiaojian has recently established the Meifeng Bronze Foundry on Hongqiao Road. In addition to sculpting and casting bronze statues, he also uses boiler machinery to produce various carved metal artworks during his off-hours. In view of the unsightly designs and coal-consuming nature of the stoves sold on the market, he has independently researched and manufactured a new type of stove. Its exterior is shaped like the bronze tripods and vessels of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, and it is equipped with a new type of ventilated firebrick inside, so it consumes very little coal, even less than the imported Junkers stoves. This stove will soon be available in large quantities and is said to be sold through the Home Industry Cooperative, National Goods Company, and department stores.</p>

<h3>Fire in Pudong</h3>
<p>At around 2:11 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the Zhenhua Liji Textile Factory, No. 4 Lan Road, Yangshupu, where the lower level is a cotton ginning room. Sparks from the machinery flew into the cotton, causing a sudden fire. Smoke filled the air, and flames soared. The male and female workers in the workshop swarmed out in a very chaotic manner. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished after more than an hour. Because the factory foundation is built of cement, it is not easy to catch fire. Only the cotton was burned and water damaged, with a loss of about 400 taels. It is said to be covered by fire insurance.</p>
<p>At around 6:40 PM last night, a fire broke out in an unnumbered bungalow opposite the China General Omnibus Company at the junction of Kangnao Road and the French Concession in West Shanghai, burning down three houses. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Appeals for Slum Dwellers; Sends Letter to the Public Works Department for Sympathy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to Zhong Siyun, Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement, yesterday, stating that the Jianghuai Association in Shanghai had received a letter from its members Xu Xijin, Gu Baoan, Xu Xizhong, and 51 others, stating that the shacks inhabited by the poor were located in a piece of wasteland east of Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, which was originally a swamp. The landlord told the poor that if they filled in the land, they could build shacks and live there for 10 or 8 years without any fixed term. The poor people, having no money, believed his words and first filled in a small portion of the swamp, building four or five huts. After the Sino-Japanese War, more and more poor people came, so they filled in a section of the swamp, building one shack at a time. To date, it has been four years, and the swamp has been completely filled in, and the shacks are fully occupied. There are still traces of the swamp that can be used as evidence. There are more than 30 households on the two streets. The landlord on the west side is Xu Weiren, who collects 30 yuan in rent each year, and the one on the east side is Xu Xiaofu, who collects 50 yuan each year, with the rent due on the fifth month of each year, and no arrears are allowed. On the fifth day of the fifth month of this year, the poor people paid the rent in full. The land rent is collected by Shen Xisheng every year. Unexpectedly, in June of this year, the Health Bureau, due to the disorderly shacks and unsanitary conditions, specifically notified the poor people to rebuild them into three rows for the sake of hygiene. The poor people had no choice but to rebuild them according to the regulations, which really left them destitute. During the rebuilding process, which took about two weeks to complete, the landlord was not seen to interfere. Unexpectedly, after only a month of living there, the landlord had ill intentions. He went back on his word, bullied the poor and favored the rich, and subleased the land to the Hongda Rubber Factory to build a factory, forcing the poor to relocate immediately. Although they are shacks, each one costs about 30 yuan to build. The poor people borrowed from all sides with great difficulty, and now they want to demolish them. In the cold winter, they have no home to return to, and it is difficult to find shelter in the open. The lives of more than 100 people, old and young, will surely freeze to death on the road and die in the ditches. This is truly unbearable to hear and see. Alas, the landlord uses such oppressive means, in addition to mobilizing the police and Bao Tiao to intimidate them, and has asked lawyer Xu Zaiyi to issue a notice, limiting them to demolishing everything within a week, and there is no time to lose. If this is true, the poor people have no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth.</p>
<p>The letter continues, "The poor people were promised by Xu Weiren and others that they could fill in the pond land with their labor and live there for a long time, and they have paid the rent every year without any shortage. This is a legitimate lease relationship with proper procedures and legal behavior. It should not be described as unauthorized construction. Even if the land is taken back for use, the residents should be given sufficient preparation time and should not be forced to do so immediately, let alone subleased to a third party instead of being taken back for self-use. Moreover, in June of this year, the residents were ordered by the Health Bureau to rebuild the two rows into three rows, avoiding economic losses, and they have already suffered greatly. Their vitality has not yet recovered, and now, in the severe cold, they are suddenly ordered to demolish the houses and relocate within a week, which will inevitably expose more than 100 people to the elements and endanger their lives. This is not only unfair in terms of reason and logic, but also not what the municipal authorities would want to see. Therefore, we are sending a copy of lawyer Xu's notice and writing to your council, requesting that the Bureau of Public Works and the municipal authorities take public opinion into consideration and handle the matter with caution, or postpone it until the spring of next year, when the weather is warmer, and let our association find an address for them to relocate to, in order to relieve the poor and avoid disputes. We hope you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly."</p>
<p>After reviewing the letter, the association stated that the case is a dispute between the landlord and the tenants. According to the law and the previous correspondence between the Bureau and the Council on this matter, it is certain that the police will not be sent to enforce the landlord's order. This is what the Association firmly believes. However, as it is now severe winter, and these poor slum dwellers have no home and are exposed to the elements, for the sake of public order and humanity, the municipal authorities can certainly provide considerable assistance from a political standpoint. Accordingly, the Council is requested to examine the matter and, within the scope of the law, show deep sympathy for the slum dwellers.</p>

<h3>Tao Erbao Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Premeditated Murder</h3>
<p>Tao Erbao of Wusong was a vagrant, so his younger sister, Tao Xiaomei, who was of marriageable age, had not yet found a husband. As a result, she was seduced and became romantically involved, and was sold as a concubine to Li Xigen, the owner of the Hongsheng Paper Store in Caojiadu. When Tao Erbao returned home and learned of the situation, he felt that since his sister had become a concubine, he, as the elder brother, had not received any bride price, so he went to borrow 500 yuan. As a result, he was given 30 yuan, which he was not satisfied with, and left. On the evening of October 2, at 8:00 PM, thugs came to the store and shot Li Xigen to death. After the wife of the deceased, Li Zhao, reported to the Detective Team, Tao Erbao was arrested. He was transferred to the Local Court by the Public Security Bureau, and the prosecutor filed a public prosecution against him for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. After a hearing and debate, Judge Guan opened the court yesterday afternoon and sentenced Tao Erbao to life imprisonment for premeditated murder, with deprivation of civil rights for life. The judge said that according to the law, the crime was punishable by death, but the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment. Tao Erbao was not satisfied, and the judge told him that he could appeal according to the law. He was then ordered to be taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Chen Qinxi Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Aiding and Abetting Murder</h3>
<p>Yan Zhang (aka Li Azhang), 21 years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 24 Taopeng Road. Previously, he had a deep grudge against a fellow townsman named Ahua over the issue of a handgun. As a result, at around 9:00 PM on August 22, Ahua, together with Xiang Xiasheng, who had already been sentenced to imprisonment, and Chen Xi, Zhang Quan, Xiaobiao, and others who were at large, lured Azhang to a remote and dark place near Guiyang Road and Chegong Road under the pretext of taking a stroll to cool off. Ahua then took out a pistol and shot Azhang. Azhang was hit in a vital part of his body, fell to the ground, and called for help. Zhang Quan and Chen Xi then took off his pants, pushed him into a small ditch, and hoped that he would die quickly. Afterwards, the Chinese and Western detectives from the police station in charge of the area found him and arranged for him to be sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital, where he died of his injuries. On the 5th of this month, Su Changsheng, the Chinese detective chief of the Yulin Road Police Station, and Detective Xie Wanfang arrested Chen Xi (aka Chen Qinxi) on Yuezhou Road and sent him to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, requested that the defendant be severely punished because of his cruel methods. The court issued an order to await sentencing.

He was previously a manager at the Qichang Yong Silk Factory in Zhabei. He was dismissed seven or eight months ago and formed a partnership with a friend to rent a house at No. 12 Gonghe Road. Recently, his friend returned to Huzhou, so he gave up the house a few days ago. He had been staying in Room 55 of the Southeast Hotel for two days. Because he had run out of money, and thinking that he had been unemployed for a long time and had no hope for the future, he had the idea of ending his life. He still had a mother at home, and he was not yet married. He had worked in Shanghai for 13 years, but because he loved to gamble, he had no savings. Once he lost his job, he had no face to return home. This was the reason for his suicide. The District Chief, feeling that his situation was very pitiful, ordered him to be sent to the Headquarters for assistance.</p>

<h3>Verdict on Counterfeit Three Flower Cold Cream Trademark</h3>
<p>The Three Flower Cold Cream produced by the American company Hedner has been sold in China for more than ten years. The trademark was first used in China in 1918 and was verified by the Trademark Bureau. The Trademark Bureau issued Reassessment Document No. 21 on May 9 of this year. In July of last year, the Tianshu Industrial Company on Wuzhou Road in this city manufactured and sold Three Hua Cream, imitating the trademark of the cold cream. The structure of the entire pattern on the box, the colors used, the arrangement method, and the layout of the patterns were all very similar. In October of last year, Garnay, the representative of Hedner in Shanghai, discovered this and reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which seized many counterfeit trademark goods and filed a lawsuit. The case was heard by the First Special District Court and the debate ended last month. The verdict was announced on the first day of this month. The main text of the verdict stated that Zhu Zhonghe (the manager of the company) intended to deceive others by counterfeiting the trademark and was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years. All 744 bottles of Three Hua Cream, 908 small empty paper boxes, 55 trademark papers, and 48 hard papers were confiscated. The reasons for the verdict are too long to be recorded in full.</p>

<p>Ge Xiunian, an 18-year-old apprentice from Suzhou at Hao Xiangwei Tobacco and Paper Shop, located at No. 85 Pushi Road in the French Concession, was instructed by his employer to take four hundred and fifty silver dollars in cash to the Hengfengtai Tobacco and Paper Exchange in Zhengjia Wood Bridge to exchange for copper coins on the morning of the 20th at around 9:00 AM. As Ge was passing by the Xiaocaichang (small vegetable market) near the Eight Immortals Bridge, two robbers wearing yellow and blue cloth short shirts and trousers and speaking in the local dialect suddenly rushed up and blocked his way.

<h3>News from Various Native Place Associations</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Native Place Association in Shanghai held its ninth board meeting yesterday. Directors Chen Fengyuan, Chen Qifen, Weng Ziguang, Pan Zhiquan, Wen Hongen, Wu Chengyu, Tang Haian, Wu Tiecheng (representing Li Dachao) attended. Supervisors Wu Jishun, Physician Wu Jiangleng also attended. Tang Haian presided and Lu Yuquan recorded the minutes. Matters reported included: (1) Chairman Tang reported on the payment for the purchase of the association's building. The full price of the building's land, fifty-three thousand taels of silver, had been paid. The income from donations, after deducting the association's and hospital's routine expenses, repaying old debts of the hospital, and paying for the building, was still short by eight thousand silver dollars. These funds had been advanced by individuals. As this concerned the public good of our hometown, they dared not calculate interest. If the association's finances were to become difficult, they would not dare to request repayment. However, the hospital and the association still required fifty thousand dollars for future purchases. It seemed necessary to continue fundraising to achieve complete success. The property deed had been handed over to the association, and a proposal was made to elect custodians to ensure due solemnity. It was resolved that efforts should be made to raise donations to repay the eight thousand dollars as soon as possible. The method of fundraising would be discussed after moving to the new location. The deed would be kept by Director Tang to ensure its solemn custody. Matters discussed included: (1) Director Wu Tiecheng proposed setting a date and formalities for the opening of the new location and selecting preparatory staff in advance to facilitate the event. It was resolved to appoint directors Chen Fengyuan, Xi Guansheng, Li Dachao, Chen Qifen, Weng Ziguang, Yang Meinan, and Pan Zhiquan as preparatory staff, convened by Li Dachao. The preparatory committee would plan all the opening procedures and submit them to the board of directors for approval. Temporary motions: (2) Supervisor Wu Jishun proposed purchasing medical equipment for the hospital, which had arrived from Germany, and requested the allocation of three thousand dollars for payment. He also proposed dissolving the executive committee of the Guangdong People's Hospital to centralize authority. It was resolved that the previous resolution to allocate three thousand dollars would be implemented after the goods arrived from Germany and a bill was submitted for approval. Regarding the dissolution of the executive committee, reasons should be presented to the association, and the matter would be discussed at the next meeting. (3) Physician Wu Jiangleng reported on his investigation into the dispute between physicians Wu Jingyao and Chen Daming. Both sides realized their errors, which seemed to be misunderstandings. It was resolved to publicly recommend that Director Chen Fengyuan and Physician Wu Jiangleng revisit both parties to convey the association's intention to promote harmony and provide sincere explanations.</p>

<p>New Invention: Pigment Mercury Disinfectant: While many disinfectants have appeared on the market recently, truly perfect medications are still rare. Recently, Li Chao of the Capital Nanjing Commercial Cooperative Society's laboratory has, through diligent study and extensive experimentation, invented the pigment mercury disinfectant. The product's advantage is that it does not burn the skin and has no irritating properties. It has a certificate of analysis from the Health Testing Laboratory, so it is often used as a disinfectant for surgical procedures. For conditions such as pneumonia, erysipelas, scarlet fever, diphtheria, syphilis, etc., a solution of one part per thousand is used for washing and gargling. It can also prevent infectious diseases. For knife wounds, broken skin, and scrofula, it can be used as a topical application, capable of disinfecting, removing decay, and closing wounds. The majority of its raw materials are domestically produced. It is reported that major hospitals and physicians both locally and abroad are happy to adopt it, so sales are very active. Major pharmacies selling pigment mercury are competing to order goods.</p>
<p>New Use for Hot Water Bottles: Any high-temperature water bottle can be used to cook porridge and stew soup. Therefore, economical families often adopt this method, as it requires no fuel cost. According to a certain gentleman, his family has three Tiantan brand domestic water bottles. One is used to cook porridge for his young daughter's breakfast, one is used to cook lotus seed soup for his and his wife's occasional snack, and another is used to cook white fungus for his elderly mother's nourishment. Assuming the cost of each type of fuel is just over three cents, one month would be three dollars, so thirty-six dollars can be saved annually.</p>

<h3>The University Federation Cables Chen Mingshu, Stating that the National Crisis is Severe and the Only Way is to Unite with Common Hatred of the Enemy to Defend Against Insults; Otherwise, Speaking of Resisting Japan and Saving the Country is Ultimately Betraying the Party and the Country</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Student Federation, believing that the Minbian (Fujian Incident) was manipulated and directed by Chen Mingshu alone, sent a cable yesterday condemning him, stating: Chen Zhenru of Fuzhou, Your Excellency, Reports state that you have colluded with elements of the so-called Third Party, established your own banner, and implemented a rebellion. Those near and far are shocked and dismayed. The country is facing the adversity of foreign aggression and domestic troubles, and the people are trapped in dire suffering. Even with a united effort to save the situation, we fear it may be insufficient. Yet you, sir, are willing to act perversely, further disrupting the life of the country with turmoil. We do not know what your intentions are. The national crisis is so severe, the only way is to unite with common hatred of the enemy and defend against insults. Otherwise, speaking of resisting Japan and saving the country is simply using ulterior motives and is ultimately betraying the party and the country. As the saying goes, those who have the Tao (the right way) receive much help, and those who lose the Tao receive little help. A political life must be built on the foundation of public opinion. If you wish to borrow a name to create a feudal separatist situation, it is tantamount to destroying the anti-foreign front and prolonging the life of the Red bandits. You will be unable to escape the blame for misleading the country and harming the people, and will be remembered forever in infamy. We send this cable to condemn you and hope you will heed it. Wisdom, foolishness, virtue, and wickedness - it is for you to choose. Shanghai University Student Federation, bowing in respect. (Ma)</p>
<h3>The End of the Wuben School Disturbance 丨Joint Statement by the Old and New Principals丨</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent student disturbance at the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School due to opposition to the Director of Studies, various newspapers have carried different accounts. Some involve the former principal, Wang Xiaoying, and the China Girls' High School, while others involve other teachers and staff who resigned voluntarily. As a result, the truth is unclear and misunderstandings abound. The new and former principals (husband and wife), as well as several teachers and staff who resigned voluntarily, were invited by the new principal to a dinner at the Atlantic Western Restaurant yesterday. They each recounted the course of the school disturbance, clarifying the truth and dispelling misunderstandings. They jointly issued the following statement: It has been found that the school disturbance at Wuben occurred one week after the new principal took office, clearly unrelated to the principal's appointment. Subsequently, the following issues led to misunderstandings in various quarters. In order to clarify the truth for those who care about the school, explanations are provided below, item by item:</p>
<p>(1) The Process of Establishing the Student Union: At the beginning of the school disturbance, there were suspicions that the student union was being used as a weapon. In fact, during the summer vacation, the school had already received instructions from the Special Municipal Party Department to organize a student union. At that time, the former principal had already decided to resign and was awaiting the Education Bureau to find a successor. Therefore, apart from maintaining regular classes, they were unwilling to hold other extracurricular activities. Later, the Municipal Party Department repeatedly urged them to establish it within two weeks. They had no choice but to instruct the Dean of Students to notify the students of the general idea of the instructions for their own decision, to show that they would no longer be responsible for guidance. Judging from this, the organization of the student union was merely a routine school matter and did not have any special mission.</p>
<p>(2) The Handover Process between the Old and New Principals: After the school disturbance began, there were rumors that the former principal was unwilling to hand over duties. In fact, on the day the new principal was announced, the former principal advised them to take over as soon as possible and arrive at the school to take office early, to avoid the school's spirit from dissipating. Therefore, the new principal was announced on the third day, and at 10:00 AM the next morning, the former principal personally went to the school to hand over duties with the heads of each department. As for the financial part, because the budget for the 893 months of this year must await the Education Bureau's budget decision before the final accounts can be prepared, submitted to the bureau for approval and reimbursement, and the temporary expenses approved by the Education Bureau in the past and the regular expenses for October have not yet been received, so there is still a part that cannot be transferred. The rest has been transferred clearly, and the facts are all there. The so-called unclear handover and inability to take over are all groundless rumors.</p>
<p>(3) Student Representatives Going to China Girls' High School for Meetings: Because the China Girls' High School is close to Wuben, some junior high school students in the first and second grades came to the school for tutoring. Those with ulterior motives deliberately spread rumors, referring to the tutoring students as representatives of the Wuben Student Union. In fact, the Wuben student representatives, except for one occasion when the new principal sent three students to plead with teacher Chen Guiru to withdraw their resignation, had been to China Girls' High School (including Fang Xiuzhi, who was suspended this time). All senior students and student union representatives have never been there once. The teachers and staff of China Girls' High School are confident that they still have a considerable understanding of education and will never allow the school to be a place of right and wrong, arbitrarily destroying education and destroying youth, and convicting themselves as sinners in the education world.</p>
<p>(4) The Truth about the Fuse of the School Disturbance: Among the teachers at Wuben, one teacher had occasional misunderstandings with one or two students during class and suspected that they were being instigated by a former department head. As a result, misunderstandings arose and there were complaints from time to time. The speaker had no intention, but the listener took it to heart, and the word spread, resulting in errors. In fact, these were all personal conflicts, and the scope of the words was not related to China Girls' High School. Those close to the new principal mistakenly believed that it had a lot to do with the school. When the new Director of Studies arrived at the school, the school disturbance broke out, and various parties were thus led to layers of misunderstandings. The school disturbance almost became irreparable due to various misunderstandings. Fortunately, the new and former principals were originally classmates and both took education as their standpoint and caring for Wuben as the premise, opened their hearts and spoke frankly, and had a joint conversation. Some teachers also attended the meeting and stated that their usual remarks were all personal matters and had nothing to do with the school. Unexpectedly, someone relayed the rumors from it, causing this misunderstanding. The new and former principals were very satisfied that the layers of misunderstandings were dispelled in one day. Although the opening of China Girls' High School was delayed, classes have resumed as usual. The principal of the school will report the process to the director, and there is no problem. A case has been clarified to the world and can be concluded from now on.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Last Night Southeast Teams All Win Group A Defeats Jinan by a Large Margin Score 39 to 5 丨Three Matches Tonight丨</h3>
<p>The three winning teams in last night's women's basketball games were all from the Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' College, and all were one-sided. Qiangdong defeated Meizhuan 55-16, Qiangnan defeated Shangzhong 48-13, and Group A Southeast defeated Jinan 38-5 by a large margin. The Group A match was exceptionally exciting. Jinan was extraordinarily strong, with strict offense and defense, but Southeast worked hard and was closely guarded, which made Jinan helpless. Although Liu Mali was very strong, she was trapped by strict defense and could not display her skills, scoring only five points, three of which were free throws and only one field goal. Ren Shujiao was like a swimming dragon, and it was truly a sight to behold. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Ms. Liu Wenhua Scores Three Consecutive Goals</h3>
<p>The Group A battle began, and the Jinan players were all tall and strong, brave and extraordinary, rushing left and right, unstoppable, hovering under the basket, eager to try. Southeast strictly defended and did not relax at all. After a short stalemate, Liu Mali opened the scoring with a free throw. Southeast did not take it to heart, and the forwards launched a major offensive, not diminishing their efforts because the opponent's defense was strong. Liu Wenhua was steady and scored three consecutive goals, greatly boosting the morale. Liao Zhuyuan passed the ball well, and Ren Shu also scored. At the end of the first quarter, Jinan only scored one more point by Liu Mali, and Southeast took the lead with 9-2.</p>
<h3>Ms. Ren Shu Is as Graceful as a Swimming Dragon</h3>
<p>Jinan was unwilling to be outdone and worked hard to counterattack. Liu Mali was ambitious and did not yield to the spirit of men, repeatedly shooting from a distance, but unfortunately, her method was not effective, her aim was inaccurate, and she did not score at all. Moreover, the front line could not connect, and there was no gap to take advantage of under the basket, so she could only sigh helplessly. Southeast was even more active, and Jinan's defense was even stricter. Ms. Ren Shu was elusive, as graceful as a swimming dragon, and her two long-range shots from the sideline won thunderous applause. This was the most intense performance of the quarter. Jinan still made no achievements, only adding one point by Liu Mali with a free throw. At the end of the first half, Southeast had 15 points and Jinan had 3 points.</p>
<h3>Miss Mali Flies into a Rage</h3>
<p>As the battle resumed, Jinan was eager to retaliate and struggled hard, but they were monitored by the enemy everywhere and it was difficult to move. Liu Mali was so angry that she flew into a rage, roared, and startled everyone. At the same time, applause and laughter filled the hall. However, her left and right hands could not cooperate, and she could not support the building alone. Southeast's forwards continued to score seven more points, while Jinan gained nothing. At the end of the third quarter, Southeast won with 22-3.</p>
<h3>Reaching the End of Their Strength, They Suffered a Complete Defeat</h3>
<p>At the end of the third quarter, Jinan did not score a single field goal, only scoring three points from free throws. Therefore, in the final quarter, they strived for scoring opportunities, but when the ball reached the basket, it was often snatched by the opponent, leaving them helpless. After repeated efforts, He Menghua finally scored a goal, adding two points. The defenders persevered and fought, but they were overwhelmed, and they were exhausted. Southeast's forwards became more and more powerful, scoring goals like stringing beads, and scoring another sixteen points. In the end, Southeast won with 38-5. The referee was Shi Zhaokang, and the scores of the three groups, A, B, and C, were recorded below:</p>

<h3>Basketball Friendship Match John Defeats Daxia Last Night Result 51-30</h3>
<p>The Daxia basketball team went to Fanhuangdu last night at the invitation of John's University for a basketball friendship match. Chen Jiaqiu, the giant of Daxia, has announced his departure and joined Qingguang. The combat strength has inevitably decreased. In the course of the battle, it was initially close, and then there were ups and downs. Finally, John stood out and won. The result was 51-30.</p>
<h3>The General Is Injured, and the Spirit Is Immediately Lost</h3>
<p>John was familiar with the terrain. After the battle, he immediately became active. Cheng Zhou worked hard and made achievements. He took the lead with four points, and everyone was happy. Daxia was only temporarily defeated and was not a weakling. They took a temporary break in the hope of recovering. Sure enough, in the blink of an eye, they scored eight consecutive points, soaring above. The difference was half. John knew that a strong enemy was ahead and was not easy to deal with. He also stopped his military operations and devised another strategy. From then on, the scores of the two armies inside and outside were up and down by one or two points. 12.16 and other numbers were seen repeatedly. Suddenly, Chen Zhengqiu was injured, and the situation changed suddenly. John then soared to 25-17, taking the lead in the first half.</p>
<h3>The Main Army Shows Its Strength, and the Situation Is Clearly Divided</h3>
<p>In the second half, the equal situation turned into high and low. John took advantage of the victory and was invincible. In addition, the enthusiastic shouts of the students were also intense. He almost grasped the central hub of the overall situation and commanded as he pleased. Fortunately, the army of Daxia was united and still striving to achieve something in a difficult situation, barely supporting it, otherwise the entire army would inevitably collapse. As a result, John won 51-30.</p>

<h3>Special Articles: New Trends in European Sports, Lecture by Cheng Dengke, Notes by Sha Zhongchi of Jiangnan Sports Teachers College</h3>
<p>In our country, nothing is really on the right track, and sports are just one example. I remember when I first entered Berlin Sports University, the professor asked me about the overall organization and trends of sports in our country. I was stunned and couldn't answer. I, a member of the sports community, was in such a state, so it goes without saying for the rest of the working masses. Later, I promised that I would be able to provide a detailed reply when the Olympics were held in Berlin in 1936, but I had already realized my utter embarrassment and felt extremely ashamed. This was the greatest shame of my life. Looking at the progress of sports in European countries, it is flourishing, and the organization is truly meticulous and the facilities are well-equipped, which is quite astonishing. In addition to strengthening the body, the purpose is also to serve as a backup for the government. Sports are used to open up military training, instilling a unified spirit, sincere unity, and striving to enable the country or individuals to obtain the true benefits of sports. Therefore, every young person must receive sports training, military-style sports training, to increase their physical strength. Drawing lessons from the ancient Greek nation, the reason for their strength was the practice of reviving the past. Therefore, their slogan is "militarization of sports" and "sports militarization." The general outline of their sports facilities is described separately below:</p>
<p>Turkey: We all know that Turkey is an old country, the China of the West, which has always paid little attention to sports. As a result, the people's physical fitness is weak and their spirit is listless, and they are despised by the great powers. Now, since General Kemal came to power, he has implemented a revival movement, greatly innovating, and sending a large number of outstanding domestic talents and those interested in sports to study sports abroad, mostly to Germany. At the same time, he also hired German sports experts at great expense to design and establish large-scale national sports universities in the country in order to achieve his goal of strengthening the country and the race. I know that in the next World Games, the Turkish flag will surely give people a deep impression. Italy: Prime Minister Mussolini promotes sports with the spirit of Fascism, paying special attention to youth sports and children's sports, which is slightly different from Turkey. Mussolini recently established the Mussolini Sports University in Rome, which offers a doctorate in sports (Note by the reporter: no other country has this degree). The construction of the school is magnificent, with the ground paved with terrazzo and the walls built with marble, but it is not easily accessible to visitors. Without Mussolini's signature, any group or individual will be rejected. This is due to the ideology. When we went to visit the school, we first asked the German Ministry of Education to notify Mussolini, but we still didn't see the whole picture. Italy has a comprehensive standard and training for sports, and the uniforms of each young person are like those of the military. This is the trend of sports towards military training, which can be seen from this. Moreover, Mussolini is particularly strict in assessing sports teachers, because they should serve as role models and mentors for young people. The Italian slogan is "concentrate talents," "unite the whole," and "tie the country to sports," which is incomparable to the self-serving nature of our country's sports community.</p>
<p>Germany: All sports facilities in Germany are similar to those in Italy, but the national character is more vigorous than in Italy. Students from the Berlin National Sports University often exchange classes with students from the Rome Italian Sports University, but only a limited number of one or two people. In the past, foreign students coming to Germany to study at the National Sports University could account for half of the students, but the current government has issued an order to the school that foreign students are absolutely not allowed to be admitted in the future, implementing dictatorship. In short, everything in Germany imitates Italy, and the government organization is also like Italy, assimilated to Mussolini. The most fashionable cross-country running in Germany now is armed race walking, in other words, race walking in military uniform with guns and ammunition. Germany can train 100,000 junior officers every three years, all using sports as a fuse. Therefore, although Germany suffered a great deal in the European war, other countries still fear it like a tiger.</p>
<p>England: Witnessing the increasingly robust national character of Germany and Italy, England also realized the urgency and need for military sports, and is working hard to make progress every day, although it is slightly inferior to Germany and Italy. However, England uses extracurricular activities to give high-pressure methods, paying attention to youth sports and children's sports, sparing no effort.</p>
<p>France: France focuses on military sports and youth outdoor sports. Its open mountain and forest areas are equipped with bathrooms and other facilities for youth outdoor sports, and the government authorities give special preferential treatment to each ball team and track and field team when they go out to compete. No matter when and where, the transportation costs are reduced by half, and children are even free. Their attention to sports is very thoughtful.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia: Soviet Russia now has a meticulous plan for sports. The first step is to train a large number of primary school sports teachers, starting with elementary school students to lay the foundation. It also has large-scale public sports equipment, paying attention to the working masses, and especially promoting women's sports to strengthen the physical fitness of mothers. Therefore, in Europe, apart from Germany, Soviet Russia is the most outstanding. Summary: The new trend of sports in Europe, in addition to the above countries, is the same in Finland, Austria, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, and other countries. They all pay attention to youth sports and children's sports. The governments of each country divide each person into three periods and determine the standard of sports performance. Each person sequentially reaches the performance within the time limit. At the age of eighteen, a sports examination is held. Those who fail are subject to legal restrictions and retrained. Governments at all levels also issue certificates and medals, and award prizes according to the level of achievement. The parents of those who win prizes even hang the prizes in the living room to show their glory. Adults and women can also participate, but are not restricted. In addition to the above, competitions such as target shooting, transporting ammunition, throwing hand grenades, digging trenches, and surveying geography are held every quarter. Various races are also conducted using the skirmish line method, and each person is instructed to run 100 meters or 200 meters without a target, knowing the location of the finish line. Moreover, each sports association is organized into a brigade to implement military training. In short, military affairs are incorporated into sports, so that everyone knows that to revitalize the country, it is necessary to hang up arms. This is the universally recognized purpose of the militarization of sports in Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, I offer some opinions to you all: (1) It is necessary to train sports teachers and lay the foundation for sports, and then use sports methods to revive the nation. (2) Sports should be democratized and popularized among farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and lessons can be learned from Europe and the United States. (3) Our country's martial arts are excellent fighting skills, and should be explained with scientific methods to make them develop and expand. (4) Sports, martial arts, and military affairs should be integrated into a system of sports organization. (5) The Ministry of Education should have a sports inspector to specifically crack down on bad sports schools and reward successful sports schools, and to plan and integrate national sports affairs.</p>

<p>Gossip</p>
<h3>Honored Account</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>The most headache-inducing thing must be "honored account," I think.</p>
<p>Rice shops, firewood shops, all have "honored accounts," department stores, newly established companies, also have "honored accounts," truly troublesome, unmanageable "honored accounts."</p>
<p>Germany, in the European war, owed the Allied countries a large war debt, to be repaid in installments, and it would take fifty years to clear that "honored account." This can be said to be a lifetime of slavery to the "honored account," and so they are preparing to throw the "honored account" into the furnace. But those demanding the "honored account" from Germany are mostly those who have received "honored accounts" from the United States, so if Germany were to really throw the "honored account" into the furnace, the United States, even if searching with lanterns in Europe, would find it difficult to stamp a "cleared" mark on the "honored account."</p>
<p>Germany ignoring the Allied countries' demands for the "honored account" would be one thing, but it is said that they are rummaging through old account books, preparing to send a "honored account" notice to France, truly audacious. And at the same time, Russia has also received several "honored accounts," look, in the Sino-Soviet negotiations over the Chinese Eastern Railway, didn't it once spread that the puppet Manchurian government demanded to use paper radishes as a toll, and investigate the old Russian banknotes stored among the people in Northeast China? The clamor for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia has been going on for several years, and now it has finally been officially resumed. It is said that the United States' demand that Russia repay the old debts of the Tsarist era is also a major reason. It can be seen that all disputes are caused by the "honored account" acting up.</p>
<p>We Chinese are also frowning at the "honored account." The most famous is the Boxer Indemnity, which has been paid until now, with no hope of being cleared. There is also the Nishihara Loans, and although we have received the "honored account" notice, we don't know how to deal with it. The September 18th Incident, it is said, was Japan collecting the "honored account" of the Twenty-One Demands from us. But in the January 28th Incident, we suffered such a great loss for no reason, and until now, we are unable to send out this "honored account." In the Four Northeastern Provinces, our losses are even immeasurable, and to whom should we settle this "honored account"?</p>
<h3>In the Library</h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>Every day, every day, taking advantage of my free time, I always go to the circulating library of this newspaper to read books; for a year, this library has simply become my own collection of books.</p>
<p>Standing in the elevator, slowly going up, the driver accurately asks: "Third floor?" I nod, and with a swish, it stops.</p>
<p>A few steps and I'm there, so I take a blue card with white characters as usual, and enter through the low door.</p>
<p>In the library, there is hardly anyone wearing fancy clothes, nor any modern girls; burying their heads, their eyes fixed on the books, are all poor friends bearing the burden of life. From this, it can be even clearer how many people there are who don't have money to study but are still working hard, right?</p>
<p>The exquisite reading room is filled with many people, but the air is so quiet and peaceful, upholding public morality, occasionally a few coughs and the rustling of newspapers.</p>
<p>The newspapers and magazines I want to read have all been taken by quick hands, so I have to hold my chin, my eyes drifting out the window, looking at the Jingwu Athletic Association across the street playing ping pong vigorously, looking at the white clouds in the sky, floating across the azure canopy. Waiting, waiting, a newly published magazine is in my hands, so I read quietly, each word flying into my brain to roll around, page by page; this is much better than watching that unconscious movie!</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I linger in the library, but I don't know if my own knowledge has improved a bit?</p>
<h3>Wealthy Men and Fashionable Women</h3>
<p>— Dao An</p>
<p>The term "talented men and beautiful women" is no longer applicable in today's increasingly progressive modernization. Look at the ideal partners of modern women, which one doesn't emphasize wealth? The ideal girlfriends of modern young men, which one doesn't emphasize fashion? In other words, women value wealth, and men value beauty. So "talented men and beautiful women" should now be changed to "wealthy men and fashionable women," which is more accurate. If you only have a belly full of learning but no money, then it is really impossible to get the favor of beauties. If women only have a beautiful appearance but no colorful and fashionable clothes, and have not been baptized by modernity, then how can they get the welcome of men.</p>
<p>Is money omnipotent? So women with weak will and admiring vanity are often tempted and hooked, and as a result, they are bound to be disappointed in love and ruined in reputation. But for women who cherish their purity, money cannot move their hearts, and temptations cannot change their minds.</p>
<p>Is money also the root of all evil? The love bought with money, which can make you pure and noble, is definitely not true love.</p>
<h3>Small</h3>
<p>— Hu Yanwen</p>
<p>The word "small" contains a bit of contempt, so adults scold children, opening their mouths with "little" ghost or "little" fellow, "little" Bi San.</p>
<p>But it is not always the case: modern women, if you tease them, saying that they will be the "small" mistress in a mansion in the future, then they will definitely raise their eyebrows, widen their almond eyes, and grit their silver teeth, cursing you to be killed a thousand times; if you praise their figure as delicate and "small", like a "small" angel, a cute "small" bird, then they will feign shyness and anger, sending you a charming wink. Isn't this a satisfying reward? As the West Chamber says, "How can it compare to that autumn wave at the moment of departure!" This charming wink will make your bones soft and muscles numb, which is truly a different feeling from cursing you to be killed a thousand times!</p>
<p>Japan is a "small" island, because it is so "small," so we people don't take it to heart; but Japan uses its somewhat "small" cleverness to work hard and finally occupy one of the positions of the great powers. It sent troops to seize our Three Northeastern Provinces, relying on its short and "small" elite soldiers, and helped the puppet country to establish itself. And China, with its large land and many soldiers, thinks its power is too "small" and dares not resist this short and "small" army.</p>
<p>The Nine Islands occupied by France are "small" islands too. Our aspirations, healthy and promising physique, under the leadership of the god of money, are consumed and exhausted. But money: doesn't come to entice you: doesn't lead you: isn't it you who goes to command money?</p>
<p>Is female beauty omnipotent? So young people with unsettled blood cannot withstand the alluring female beauty that is coquettish and charming. Those who are infatuated with the corners of qipao, begging for her pity and favor, have never been seen.</p>
<p>Is female beauty also the root of all evil? It can turn your hundred-refined steel into a finger-wrapping softness, and it can make you hypnotized, going east if she says east, going west if she says west: once she opens her mouth, except for not being able to get the stars in the sky, everything else can be done according to her orders: it can also make you enter a bewitched formation, confused and messed up. But female beauty: doesn't come to confuse you: doesn't tempt you: isn't it you who tempts them, worships them? This is called beauty does not bewitch people, people bewitch themselves.</p>
<p>Women's vanity is inherently strong, but to get lifelong happiness from vanity is probably a dream?</p>
<p>Men who are fickle, not hesitating to sacrifice money and spirit, even issuing a general mobilization order to the god of love, charging and fighting, going through fire and water, and going through all kinds of hardships. At the end of the day, they are bound to be defeated, and may even be forced to sign a treaty under the city. So to get a satisfactory and virtuous helper from the rouge team is probably not possible.</p>
<p>You must know that true love cannot be bought with money, because it is so "small," so we only argue with people a few words in words. People see that we are "small" and "small" spirited, and think that we can't do anything big, so they ignore us. The Chinese are too "small"-minded, afraid of quarreling with people and losing out, so they simply don't even make "small" noises!</p>
<p>The Chinese hang up a big signboard, but they all have "small" eyebrows, "small" eyes, "small" hearts, and are "small"-minded, so that the country's territory shrinks day by day, and in the international position, they can only be listed alongside those "small" countries in the colonies. Alas, China, there are no adults!</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nineteen: Wanting to Leave, yet Reluctant to Leave, Remembering the Past in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow, Sick in the Late Autumn</p>
<p>These words of Elder Zhao, on the surface, were explaining to himself, but in fact, he was explaining these words to everyone. Guizhi watched from the side, thinking, even a straightforward person like the old master is speaking in such roundabout ways, one can know his helplessness reached what extent. So she smiled at Elder Zhao: "I also say so. Whatever one does, one has to follow one's duty and follow along to do what one should do. Home is nothing, as long as things are accomplished, no matter how extravagant it is, the family will be able to be lively like that. This is my mind, but it is still considered small. Like Miss Huang, she is a big-minded, ambitious person, what country is going to perish, the donkey driver is responsible!" Elder Zhao laughed heartily upon hearing this. Huang Manying, who was sitting in the chair, had been keeping a straight face and looking down, not looking at anyone. At this time, hearing Guizhi saying several words wrong, she couldn't help but laugh. Elder Zhao said with a smile: "My eldest daughter, the country is going to perish, this is such a big thing, hastily asking the donkey driver to bear this responsibility, isn't this making things difficult? If you say these words to the donkey driver, he can truly say, what does it have to do with me, I can't manage it." Saying this, Huang Manying laughed again. Guizhi knew that she had said something wrong and should feel ashamed. But thinking that it was rare for Elder Zhao and Miss Huang to laugh so heartily, she said: "Yo! Miss Huang, didn't you tell me like this? How come when we say it, it provokes you to laugh so heartily?" Huang Manying said with a smile: "How do you plan to ask the donkey driver to bear the responsibility of the country's perishing?" Jiang Shi stood on the side, not knowing what kind of mystery they were talking about. But seeing them laughing like this, it was certainly a funny thing, so she naturally echoed them and laughed together. Because of this big laugh, a lot of sadness was reduced for everyone. Elder Zhao's concern that the Yang family mother and daughter would not be happy was also relieved. (246)</p>

<h3>The Charge Horn of Crying</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qian wrote an article "General Mobilization of Laughter," which has a lot of humor. In the various jokes, it seems that one can smell the crying of the insiders, which is especially commendable! This youngster is wary of the accusation of writing a sequel. I have scribbled a "Charge Horn of Crying." If the reader can find some laughs in this article, it is an extra gift.</p>
<p>Crying in the Sedan Chair In our Ningbo customs, when a woman is married, the family hires a sedan chair to bring the bride home. When picking up the bride, after the daughter bids farewell to the elders, when she is about to get into the sedan chair, she must face her mother and cry a song about getting into the sedan chair. The lyrics are readily available, and the villagers circulate them very widely. Little girls of five or six years old can learn to cry it in a drawn-out voice. The elders not only do not forbid it, but also praise: "Crying well! Our daughter is really good!" They don't think it's inauspicious, the more sad the crying, the more they think it's auspicious! The original meaning of the daughter crying goodbye is completely lost. On this day, the daughter also tries her best to cry out the sedan chair song she has practiced for more than ten years, word by word, so that everyone who comes to listen to the song from relatives, friends, and neighbors is satisfied and returns, then her life will be well-received!</p>
<p>The Authority of the Police Three or five rickshaws, because they can't find customers, the rickshaw pullers idly cross their legs and hang their hands on the rickshaw shafts, lingering at the end of the street. The policeman on duty here sees this and walks over, raising the baton in his hand and banging it randomly on the rickshaw canopies. Immediately, everyone pulls their rickshaws and flees. The last rickshaw puller, caught off guard, gets hit on the shoulder, pulls the empty rickshaw and barely escapes a few steps, presumably in unbearable pain. He loses his grip and the rickshaw shaft he was holding falls to the ground. The policeman misunderstands that he is not obeying his actions and is expressing anger, and chases after him, snatching a rickshaw cushion. The rickshaw puller, as usual, begs and kowtows, performing a Chinese drama. The policeman, because of his position, always occupies the superior position, so he is as arrogant as the emperor. No matter how many times you kowtow, or how many times you call him "Police Officer," he turns a deaf ear to everything! At this time, a inspector wearing a Zhongshan suit happens to arrive, inquires about what happened, and is furious! The rickshaw puller takes off his coat, revealing a bloodstain as thick as a chrysanthemum on his shoulder. The inspector, seeing this, is even more enraged and severely reprimands the police officer. He writes a line in the police officer's personal investigation diary, comforts the rickshaw puller a few words, orders the return of the rickshaw cushion, and lets the rickshaw puller pull his rickshaw and leave with tears in his eyes before leaving himself. At this time, the authority of the police officer has been stripped away, he stares bitterly at the inspector's back, with a crying face that is difficult to describe; this face expresses the life of "the big eats the small"!</p>
<p>Wedding Night On the wedding night, the bride cries sadly. The groom can't bear it, intending to persuade her to stop, but suddenly finds himself at a loss for words. After a while, the bride continues to cry sadly, and after a long time, the bride actually cries even more vigorously! The groom has to summon his courage and say, "Don't cry, crying is very bad for your body and mind! And it's not suitable for today!" The bride doesn't seem to hear and continues to cry loudly. The groom hesitates for a while and says again, "Don't cry! Are you thinking of your mother? But you have to understand: your mother doesn't allow you to cry like this either!" The bride pauses and starts crying again. The groom is disinterested in the fun, and angrily says, "Don't cry, I hate people crying the most, you know?" The bride listens and stops crying, and there is a smile on her face, which surprises the groom. He inadvertently asks the reason, and the bride smiles coquettishly, "My mother told me: if you like to laugh, I should cater to you and laugh; if you want me to cry, I have to obey and cry loudly. I knew you didn't like crying, so I wouldn't shed tears!"</p>

<h3>Commercial News, Finance, Futures Silver Exchange Rates Rise Again, Standard Gold Plunges to 6.3 Yuan, Rumors of US Raising Silver Price to Above 50 Cents</h3>
<p>The gold market trended downward yesterday, lacking support. The futures market retreated to 700 yuan. Internally, the situation was precarious. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US rose, with silver futures on the Five Metals Exchange rising between 7.5 and 8.3 points. Exchange rates continued to rise. London spot gold fell 7 pence, the US official gold buying price rose 10 cents, US wheat rose 2.25 cents, stocks rose 2.61 yuan, and US cotton rose 7 points. The opening price for wool was 12.3 yuan, then retreated to 0.067 yuan, indicating weakening confidence. After the opening, the internal market gradually loosened.

Banks seized the opportunity to buy on the cheap. At noon, it briefly fell below the 700 yuan mark, but managed to recover at the noon close. In the afternoon, confidence remained weak. Rumors circulated about a speech by the US president, raising the silver price to above 50 cents, and news of gold purchases. This may have been influenced by the 10-cent increase in US mine gold prices that day, leading to widespread speculation. It broke through the 700 yuan mark, making it difficult to recover and gradually declining. Although the internal market tightened and speculator Mr. Wu bought heavily, causing a temporary rebound, it retreated again at the close. As a result, it fell a drastic 26.3 yuan compared to the previous day. Futures silver exchange rates have been rising for two consecutive days, making it impossible for gold prices to hold.

Yuanmao, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Daxing, Yong, lowered their offer. At this point, there was a slight rebound.

<p>The announced price was 33.375 yuan due to HSBC's listed US currency long-dated at 375, equivalent to a standard gold price of 719 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 22 yuan below, 18 yuan more than the previous close.

<h3>Securities Short Covering Turns into Selling, Irresistible Trend, Public Debt New Low Prices Emerge One After Another, |Longs Down 2.3 Yuan, Shorts Down Around 1 Yuan|</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the Minbian Incident at the Chinese Securities Exchange and the central government's severe response, threatening military force, the general mood was extremely panicked. Longs were almost entirely liquidated, and retail investors mostly turned short. The situation was on the verge of a steep decline. The Minbian was in the planning stage, with widespread connections and a large scope, but due to disagreements on the main objectives, most had separated. They launched the revolt as a desperate measure, but their actions were reckless. Therefore, although Fujian Province claimed independence, it was essentially isolated. Judging from military, financial, geographical, personnel, it should not be difficult to suppress. The fluctuations of the public debt market were controlled by a few major players. Retail investors frantically sold off, providing an opportunity for major players to buy in. In the current situation, retail investors have all turned short, and a rebound is not far off. Yesterday morning, after the Minbian Incident broke out, various gangs scrambled to sell off. Most of the recent longs had already capitulated. The downsizing bonds plunged 1.5 yuan, retreating to the 60 yuan mark, and the rest also fell by around 1 yuan. In the second session, the situation was slightly confusing. Generally speaking, the middle one to three types were still slightly firm by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, while the leading and trailing types continued to fall by several points. New low prices were repeatedly discovered, indicating that there were still many speculators. In the afternoon session, which started after 6 pm, the news was gloomy and there were no major changes. Longs were still rolling over contracts. Near-term downsizing bonds were weaker, while long-dated bonds were firmer. The 19th-issue Guanshan bonds were generally up 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and the 20th-issue for this month was also up 0.3 yuan. Long-dated contracts were down 0.2 yuan. This was because No. 50 was determined to suppress small market participants, so the price was forcibly reduced from 43.8 yuan to 42.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 1 yuan. However, due to the continued influx of buyers, it rebounded to 43.3 yuan, showing the intensity of the competition. It can also be seen that the shorts were running out of steam. In the later types, they were gradually strengthening, and the sudden surge of 0.8 yuan in gold shorts can be used to summarize the rest. As a result, the market prices were down 2.3 yuan for the most part and down around 1 yuan for the least. Generally speaking, near-term contracts were down more, while long-dated contracts were down less. This was entirely due to longs rolling over contracts. The total trading volume was estimated to be around 30 million yuan for the three sessions.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Speculators Vigorously Pushing Up</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm Report: On the 20th, the New York stock market rose sharply by around 3 yuan due to better reports from several industries, rising gold prices, weaker US dollars, and firm goods prices. Automobile stocks were particularly active, and the public re-engaged in trading. Speculators were vigorously pushing up the market, and the situation was promising. The total trading volume for the day was 1.89 million shares. The American Iron and Steel Institute reported that steel production was 26.9%. Also, Hengxin Chemical and Pigment Company declared an ordinary dividend of 50 cents per share for this quarter, plus an extra red dividend of 75 cents. "Wheat" initially fell due to continued liquidation by longs, but then rose due to sporadic purchases by retail investors. However, due to the unclear situation and wavering confidence, the upward trend subsided again at the end. The news was still good. "Cotton" rose slightly due to the influence of gold and other markets. Buyers were not very enthusiastic, and factory demand was weak. Spot prices were firm. The Financial Settlement Agency bought gold at a price of 33.66 yuan per ounce, up 0.1 yuan. Here are the Dow Jones averages:</p>
<p>Close Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 101.28 Up 2.61</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 39.45 Down 1.16</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 23.62 Up 0.59</p>
<p>40 Bonds 79.03 Down 0.01</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Yarn and Cotton Still Show a Weak Trend</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending down, showing weakness. Due to the serious situation with the Minbian Incident, merchants in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other areas have stopped purchasing goods due to the impact of the situation. As a result, confidence has been slightly hit. However, near-term contracts are being maintained at a stable level by a certain association. Far-term contracts are outside of its scope, and the market has fallen slightly. Judging from the overall situation, the future is not optimistic.</p>
<h3>Forward Human Mark Weaker</h3>
<p>The human mark market opened with a nervous atmosphere, and some longs liquidated, causing each month to fall by 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. The yarn trading in the afternoon was still slow, and the market was not good. Each month fell again by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 14,250 bales. Tongfu sold 600 bales, Chunji sold 300 bales, Tongji sold 800 bales, Suilong sold 850 bales, Changfeng sold 650 bales, Xiesheng sold 650 bales, and Mingde sold 550 bales.

<p>Human Mark Closing Gain/Loss Inventory Number February 184.6 Down 0.8 44,600</p>
<p>November 185.6 Down 0.5 47,900 March 185.1 0.8 25,100</p>
<p>December 186.1 Down 0.1 46,200 April 185.2 0.8 9,550</p>
<p>January 184.3 Down 0.5 60,700 Total 234,050</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Customer Conversion Mediocre</h3>
<p>Spot yarn customer conversion is still normal. The total purchase volume from various gangs for the day was 373 bales, and the price fell by 0.25 yuan. The purchase volume from each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 25 Inland 170 Zhenjiang 20 Fellow Traders 15 Guangdong 70</p>
<p>Luzhou 10 Wuhu 10 Northern Gang 5 Nanjing 23 Yunnan 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi 10</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned downward again, US cotton is flat, and gold prices have broken through the 700 yuan mark again. Cotton yarn sales are very limited, factory demand is quiet, and Japanese merchants are also waiting for lower prices. Therefore, the selling price of spot cotton on the market is not strong, even cheaper than expired cotton. As a result, confidence has been weakened. Judging from the overall situation, there is a possibility of decline. Currently, buyers are still holding tight, so the market can still be maintained.</p>
<h3>Zheng Mark Down 0.25 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Zheng Mark market opened lower, Indian cotton was down again, US cotton was flat, and there were not many buyers in the market. Each month fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The market was still weak in the afternoon, and some longs liquidated. Each month rose by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 53,200 dan.

<p>Cheng Cotton 36.50 Hengfeng Factory bought 300 bales of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 38.25 Dong Cotton Firm bought 100 pieces and delivered to the warehouse</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market situation was uncertain due to possible congestion in deliveries. It rose due to buying by fellow traders and strong forces on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 9 points. Liverpool cotton spot loans fell 7 points, and futures fell 4 to 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 14 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to selling by speculators and liquidation by longs.

<h3>Grain Morning Weak, Afternoon Smart, Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>The flour market was bullish before the opening in the morning due to the reported rise in foreign wheat prices of several points and even one yuan, and the brisk sales in the north. However, it was affected by the Minbian Incident, and various parties sold off, causing the market to plummet repeatedly. Near-term contracts were down by 0.03 yuan, and far-term contracts were down by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon, a telegram from Tianjin reported strong sales in the area, with prices rising to 2.62 yuan. The market continued to purchase, and confidence was once again rising. All months rebounded, especially near-term contracts. Therefore, the market price for this month and April was unchanged, December was up by 0.0125 yuan, January and February were up by 0.005 yuan, and March was up by 0.0075 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened, it was necessary to be bullish on all months, carrying on the previous day's upward trend. However, it was affected by the Minbian Incident, and stockpiling stopped, and longs returned to selling off. The market then fell slightly, but foreign wheat prices rose by one yuan and several points, and the flour market rebounded again due to purchasing from Tianjin. Therefore, the wheat market rebounded again in the afternoon. As a result, January and February rose by 0.03 yuan, March rose by 0.02 yuan, December was unchanged, and the closing prices for this month and April were not opened. In the third session, November closed down by 0.03 yuan, and December closed down by 0.04 yuan in the second session. Current wheat factory sales are lacking, and the market is gradually rising. Yesterday, the price of wheat from Su County and Yao Bay was 4.2 yuan, and the price of wheat from Sun County and Gaoyou was 4.1 yuan, which were purchased by Shen Da and Xin Da.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Plunges 0.1 Yuan Due to Minbian Incident, Ningbo Gang Takes Advantage and Purchases Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market situation was that due to the Fuzhou Incident, confidence was weakened, and merchants from Fujian Province immediately stopped purchasing. Even those who had purchased and stored were not paying for the purchase. The gang originally had a trend of continuing to purchase smoothly, but due to the political changes, it was temporarily difficult to have smooth sales. The Quanzhou gang also had a desire to purchase but did not dare to fully engage. The cloth surface was weak, and the price plunged by 0.1 yuan. Subsequently, this street and the Ningbo gang took advantage and bought up. The Ningbo gang had a particularly strong desire, and immediately purchased 2,000 bags of Shashi rough rice, at prices ranging from 5.48 yuan to 5.38 yuan. This street purchased 274 bags of Wuhu machine rice, at prices ranging from 8.27 yuan to 7.9 yuan, and 108 bags of Jiangxi machine rice at 8.3 yuan, and Quanzhou purchased 400 bags of Wuxi Wharf Xian rice at prices ranging from 7.15 yuan to 7.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Purchase Intention Greatly Moves, Over 5,000 Bags Continues To Be Purchased</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source is slightly scarcer than before, with about 50 docks arriving, with about 6,000-7,000 shi of goods. Among them, late rice occupies about 30 docks, 4,000-5,000 shi. The North Sea, Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other gangs are still purchasing smoothly, over 5,000 bags, estimated to be over 6,000 shi. As a result, sellers seize the opportunity to raise prices, and the situation suddenly becomes tight. The market is quite lively, but as a result, the family purchase plate is difficult to loosen, both sides are at odds, and the people are in a state of chaos. Only after 3 pm did they gradually open up. At this time, the late rice scene is no longer very optimistic, and the market is mixed, with only a few points of improvement, and its West Liantang special goods have not yet been finalized, holding at around 6.8 yuan. Therefore, it is predicted that the market will not be as strong tomorrow. The remaining regular gangs, Su Tong gangs, and South Port's market digestions are similar to before. Only the sellers see the interest in late rice, and then raised prices one after another, slightly showing a few points of beauty. Du Yangjian has no much honor or disgrace. Yin Yuan wine customers continued to move, and the market was still smart.</p>
<p>About a dozen ships arrived in South Shanghai, according to the incoming customers. Due to the blockage of the Zhoujiadu River, the source is scarce. Today's digestions are slightly chemicalized. New japonica rice is high, materials are weak, medium and second class stand firm, and the situation in Sheep Du Wharf, passenger tip, white yuan, Yin Yuan, and other places is flat, and the early morning is thin and priced at a small angle.</p>
<h3>Raw Peanut Plunges 0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw peanut market situation was restrained by the Min Bureau, and the people's hopes for Nanyang sales were slightly hindered from now on. Therefore, the market atmosphere suddenly changed. Today, a total of 30 tons of Kaifeng goods were traded, with prices opening at 6.2 yuan, which is a huge drop of 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. The sales of other Lin grains are also showing a slight decline.</p>
<h3>Impact of the Fujian Incident on North China Goods Business丨Fuzhou Businesses Return Goods and Stop Loading丨</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the Fujian Incident coup, Fuzhou businesses recently decided to return and stop loading goods such as lily flowers, wood ear, dried vermicelli, and red dates to North China goods stores, resulting in a general trend towards market weakness.</p>
<h3>New Chaozhou Sugar Opens at 15.5 Yuan, Color Inferior to Old Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight upturn. The guild initially raised the price of No. 24 coarse grain white common sugar to 20.2 yuan without success, and then slightly reduced it to the original price of 20.15 yuan. Dutch red Nos. 8 and 9 high-quality sugar was priced at 16 yuan, with lower grades at 15.7 to 15.62 yuan, unchanged. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 20.5 yuan, CW mark 20.4 yuan, DY mark 20.25 yuan, HX mark 20.15 yuan. Mian Bai sugar from the local factories of China, Guohua, and Zhenji remained at the original price. New Chaozhou sugar was sold at 15.5 yuan due to its inferior color. Old Chaozhou sugar was also offered, priced at 15.3 to 15.1 yuan, and also at 14.8 to 14.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Price of Hardware Pig Lead Falls by 1 Dime</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the estimated price of pig lead was 16.2 yuan per dan (balance scale), a decrease of 1 dime from the previous day. Transactions by the Tianjin and Shandong businesses in the northern part of the city were minimal. However, the Fujian business, which was originally large, has been suspended recently due to the changes in the Fujian situation. In addition, there are very few other outlets, and the market outlook is not optimistic.</p>

<h3>A Realistic Understanding (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>But when Turgenev extracted this "prototype" from reality, the artist Turgenev was acting as a prophet. Whether he could make this "prototype" grow and transform from a prophet into an artist completely depended on his artistic expression. In my observation, Turgenev achieved this. Conversely, Arkady Averchenko, the author of "Sanin," was also a prophet, but his prediction was incorrect. Of course, Averchenko himself believed that he had extracted something similar to a "prototype" from reality before he started writing, but unfortunately, his understanding of reality was incorrect. His "Sanin" would never appear in the "new era," and Averchenko, who transformed from a prophet into an artist, showed too many deficiencies in his talent. His artistic expression was even more incorrect than his prediction. Therefore, "Sanin," no matter how much it angered society at the time of its publication, was a complete failure.</p>
<p>I have pointed out that Sanin is not the author but an ideal character completely opposed to the author, but in "Sanin" we can see the shadow of the author, which is the young Yuri, who was paralyzed in all his actions by the evils of education and eventually died by suicide. His character is completely opposite to Sanin's. Sanin is an excessively strong person, while Yuri is an excessively weak person, but both are equally unreal. Just as the author gave Sanin a superior condition to make him a hero, the author gave Yuri all the humble conditions to make him a hesitant person without faith or action. The author not only mocks him implicitly everywhere but even has Sanin say such words on Yuri's grave: "Now there is one less mediocre person in the world!" How can "Sanin," which is similar to the production method of Chinese novels, become a book of realistic expression art!</p>
<p>But even if we step back, if the author of "Sanin" had extracted the "prototype" of reality in the same way as the author of "Fathers and Sons," could his artistic expression have achieved the same success as Turgenev's? I can answer without a doubt that it was absolutely impossible. If a writer uses the form of essay explanation, only a correct understanding of reality or sufficient, at most, clear and smooth writing is enough. But if writing a novel, drama, or poem that is not entirely logical, then more artistic production talent and effort are necessary, and the art that Averchenko showed in "Sanin" was indeed lacking too much. In this short essay, I only want to make readers understand and agree with me on one point, which is to illustrate that the understanding of reality is inextricably linked to the correct expression of art. The saying of a certain gentleman that only the former can complete the production of art is wrong in any case. Moreover, if a writer has a correct understanding of reality but no correct expression of art, then even the part of his understanding will be destroyed.</p>
<h3>What is "Selected Studies?"</h3>
<p>— Bu Dian</p>
<p>The evil of Selected Studies still holds great power. Even famous contemporary writers have been bewitched by it, as "Free Talk" has already discussed in detail.</p>
<p>What is Selected Studies? We don't need to ask this foolish question at first. But it is not impossible to discuss it from the perspective of literary historians. I am using old stories and clichés, and unfortunately, there is no "new knowledge" for new people to draw upon, which is what I should apologize for.</p>
<p>During the Sui and Tang dynasties, there was a person named Cao Xian who was proficient in the textual studies of various schools. Since the Han dynasty, the ancient script of Du Lin and Wei Hong had been lost, but Cao Xian revived this learning. Emperor Taizong of Tang once encountered difficult words while reading, and he recorded the words that were missing from the dictionaries and asked Cao Xian about them. Cao Xian provided phonetic and explanatory annotations for all of them, along with clear citations, which greatly impressed Emperor Taizong. He was a highly respected scholar of phonology and lexicography at the time, holding the high position of reading advisor to the emperor at the old age of one hundred years. His Annotations on the Literary Selections was highly valued at the time. Initially, scholars of Literary Selections in the Jianghuai region based their studies on Cao Xian. Later, Xu Yan, Li Shan, and Gongsun Luo successively taught Literary Selections, and their scholarship flourished in the world. Thus, Selected Studies began during the Sui and Tang dynasties and flourished in the early Tang dynasty, with Cao Xian as the founding master of this learning. Du Fu wrote in a poem, "Continuing to have my son recite the Literary Selections," and "Also instructing his son to thoroughly understand the principles of the Literary Selections," indicating that Selected Studies became a distinct school of thought throughout the Tang dynasty.</p>
<p>During the Five Dynasties period, a Jinshi examination in Jiangnan required the writing of a poem on "Heavenly Rooster Playing with Gentle Breeze." When asked about the two Heavenly Roosters in Erya, the presiding examiner, Zhang Bi, was also proficient in Selected Studies. Therefore, there is a saying: "If one understands Literary Selections thoroughly, half of the scholars will succeed." After the Xining and Yuanfeng eras, scholars focused on pedantically discussing the classics, and Selected Studies fell into decline. In times when scholars were selected based on poetry and fu, Selected Studies flourished, while in times when scholars were selected based on Confucian exegesis and the eight-legged essay, Selected Studies declined. Today, there is also the Hall of Talents, and based on the trend of selecting scholars and evaluating their essays, one can also predict the rise and fall of Selected Studies.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>I walked alone on Avenue Joffre, standing in front of a flower shop.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums were in full bloom. In the glass window, various kinds of flowers were displayed, pinkish-white, light purple, goose-yellow, dark green, arranged in rows on the shelves. It unconsciously evokes a sense of beauty in people who see them.</p>
<p>A wooden tag was hanging on the stem of each flower. I don't know which elegant person named them: Golden Hook, Crab Claw, Night Fragrance, Beauty Rainbow, Eastern Fence Competing for Freshness, Old Gardener's Autumn Appearance, from two characters to four characters. It is a pity that these chrysanthemums are being treated as commercial goods here. Hanging wooden tags on them makes them seem out of place. Among all the flowers, I love chrysanthemums the most. This love is not simply for their color and fragrance, like those old-fashioned people. It is because their spirit of pride and unyieldingness is very much like that of a group of people who dedicate themselves to truth and never repent until death. And these people are the ones I respect the most.</p>
<p>I stood in front of the flower shop, looking at those flowers. Suddenly, I thought of my home, my desk, and that there were still some decorations missing on the window sill in front of my desk. I began to have an idea that I wanted to buy two pots of flowers to take home.</p>
<p>After many comparisons and selections, I finally chose two identical pots of flowers, wrote down an address, and asked the shop people to send them over to me.</p>
<p>When I returned home from outside, the chrysanthemums had already arrived before me and were placed on the window sill of my desk. The light purple flowers stood proudly, as if smiling at me.</p>
<p>I sat silently, admiring the posture of the flowers. Every day, I have such a quiet realm. This is my time for spiritual enjoyment. During this time, I have no intentions, no hopes, and not even any memories.</p>
<p>I only think of a poem, the famous line of the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho: The sound of the water when a little frog jumps into the desolate old pond.</p>
<p>But now, I no longer think of that poem. I only face the two pots of chrysanthemums. Chrysanthemums, like that poem, are full of refreshing charm and can also give me spiritual happiness.</p>
<p>"Not disliking the old gardener's autumn appearance as bland, only loving the fragrance of yellow flowers in their late bloom," I murmured softly, feeling comfortable in body and mind. I really have some petty-bourgeois temperament. However, the whip of real life is spurring me on. I can't always enjoy that pure happiness. I don't even have time to water the flowers and move the flower pots.</p>
<p>Every night, I move the flower pots to the courtyard to receive the dew, and in the morning, I move them back and place them on the window. These are all my wife's work. I am just an existing enjoyer.</p>
<p>My wife also has a chrysanthemum addiction like me, although her addiction is slightly different from mine. She simply likes to watch them for fun.</p>
<p>One day, my wife went back to her mother's home. These chrysanthemums were taken care of by me.</p>
<p>I poured some water into the pot but forgot to move the pot into the courtyard.</p>
<p>That night, I had a very strange dream: It was as if I had begun to walk into a chrysanthemum exhibition, and suddenly, that chrysanthemum exhibition turned into a vast execution ground, and those chrysanthemums had all turned into people being executed. It seemed that these people being executed were all familiar friends of mine, and then suddenly there were intermittent gunshots.</p>
<p>I woke up abruptly. It was not yet dawn. When I walked to the window to look, both pots of chrysanthemums had completely withered. The light purple petals were scattered in the pot, on the window, and on my desk. The color was just like congealed fresh blood.</p>
<p>My heart was beating slightly. I solemnly gathered the petals, hid them in a paper bag, carried them to the courtyard, dug a pit, and buried them.</p>
<p>Like a loving mother offering her only beloved son, I was doing my burial work with the same devout attitude.</p>
<h3>Literary Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>Bored in illness, I read Hu Shih's "Forty Self-Narration," the autobiography of a hero who descended from heaven. In the chapter "How I Went Abroad," he narrated the tide of the Chinese Public School at that time, the students' efforts to fight for freedom. He sent this original manuscript to his classmate Wang Jingfang at that time. Wang replied, "I was the most vocal person who opposed abolishing the rules at the beginning, but today, I really can't answer how much harm the abolishing the rules will cause to Chinese students. You were the most vocal person who opposed the Chinese Public School at that time. Seeing your article, the observations of the present and the past are very different. I think that young people's reason is suppressed by emotional impulses, and most of the trends in Chinese schools are due to this reason. One less trend in school means one more achievement. I hope you pay attention to correcting this malpractice." Dr. Hu then added that I agree with this statement, but I want to add one sentence: The trends in schools are not entirely due to young people's reason being suppressed by emotions. Among them, it is often because middle-aged people and young people have equally lost the ability to use reason. It is unfair to blame young people alone. The recent trends in the Chinese Public School are good examples.</p>
<p>One can see the changes in a person's thoughts and opinions here. Dr. Hu's meaning is very clear. At first, fighting for freedom was felt to be very meaningful, but now, it is "no big deal". Mr. Wang, one of the "strong generals," thought after the fact that the mistake was on his own side, and that fighting for freedom at that time was not right, advocating "one less trend, more achievements". Dr. Hu, another "strong general," in addition to accepting his opinion, thought that it was somewhat "inappropriate" to assign the responsibility to young people alone, so he said, "Middle-aged people and young people have equally lost the ability to use reason." Why has our doctor had such a change in his understanding of events? I say, this is why Hu Shih is Hu Shih (this "Hu Shih" should be translated as "Where are you going"). In the beginning, Dr. Hu and others withdrew from the Chinese Public School due to the trend and established the New Chinese Public School. In the end, because they could not sustain it, they returned to the old Chinese Public School under the cover of mediation. Although the doctor also felt a little "difficult," writing poems with complaints such as "There should be a feeling of the end of the world, do not forget the alliance under the city," but surrender and capitulation are ultimately surrender and capitulation. Therefore, later, a certain general opposed the vernacular, but could offer five thousand gold as a birthday gift to the "Ancestor of the Vernacular," in the eyes of people with "historical addiction and textual research addiction," Dr. Hu's actions over the years are like this.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (36)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Mr. Roland raised his head, searching in his memory,</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, I don't remember very well. This matter has been so long ago, ah! That's right, I remember. Your mother met him in the store, didn't she, Louise? He came to the store to order a few things at that time, and then he often came. He was just our customer at first, and later became a friend."</p>
<p>Pierre was eating a bowl of beans. He picked them up one by one with the tip of his fork, as if stringing the beans on it, and said, "When did this friendship begin?"</p>
<p>Roland thought again, but couldn't remember at all. He turned to his wife's memory for help,</p>
<p>"In that year, let's think about it, Louise? You must not have forgotten, your memory is so good. Think about it, it was in...in...in eighteen hundred and fifty-five or fifty-six? ... Hey, think about it, I'm sure you remember more clearly than I do." She really thought for a moment, and then said in a certain and calm voice,</p>
<p>"It was in eighteen hundred and fifty-eight. Pierre was only three years old at that time. I believe I haven't misremembered, because Pierre was suffering from scarlet fever that year, and although our friendship with Marais was still very shallow at that time, he helped us a lot." Roland exclaimed,</p>
<p>"That's true, that's true, he was simply admirable at that time. Your mother was so exhausted by you, and I had to take care of the store's business, so he went to the pharmacist to get medicine for you. He was really a kind-hearted person. And when you fully recovered, you don't know how happy he was and how he hugged and kissed you. We became good friends from this time." Then this sudden, fierce thought, like a bullet that pierced and cracked people,窜進了 Pierre's soul: "Since he met me first, took care of me like this, since he liked me and kissed me like that, since I was the reason he made friends with my parents, why did he leave all his property to my brother and not give me any?"</p>
<p>He no longer asked questions. He was now quietly silent, and it would be more accurate to say that he was burying his head in consideration rather than imagining something. In this silence, he maintained a new and not very clear concern, a new and painful source of secrecy. He left early and wandered the streets again. The street was shrouded in fog, which made the night heavy, dark, and nauseating. It was simply like an infectious smoke falling on the ground. We could see this smoke flowing in front of the gas lamps, which sometimes seemed to be extinguished by it. The stones paved on the street became slippery, like an icy night, and all the stenches, the恶臭 of cellars, caves, sewers, poor kitchens, were mixed in the恶臭 of this飘流 fog, as if they came out of the belly of those houses.</p>
<p>Pierre bent his back, put his hands in his pockets. He didn't want to stay outside when it was so cold. He walked to the Marosco's house. The old pharmacist was always dozing under the gas lamp, watching the store for himself. When he recognized Pierre, who he loved with the faithful love of a dog, he quickly cheered up, ran to find two cups and brought the raspberry wine. "How about it! How far has your sweet wine been promoted?" the doctor asked.</p>

<h3>Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Disease</h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>In the era of raging storms and the thorny road ahead for Europe, many young people became "ill" after experiencing one or more setbacks in their lives. If the patient really consulted a hospital or a licensed doctor, the symptoms they described would be nothing more than: headache, back pain, neurasthenia, weakness in the limbs, lethargy, frequent dreams, insomnia, etc. And the most that doctors could do to help him was to give him a few injections to replenish blood and nourish the brain, tell him to eat more eggs, milk, and greens, and tell him to "rest and recuperate." However, on the other hand, leaving aside the routine diagnostic procedures such as testing body temperature, pulse, blood, and excrement, we find in the lifestyles of many young people a very common disease that is "deeply ingrained" and slightly "infectious." The most appropriate name for this disease is "Degenerative Disease" or "Romantic Disease."</p>
<p>For the time being, I will imitate the routine procedures of real doctors and masters. Here, I will also boldly diagnose, find the source, and prescribe a prescription for young people suffering from degenerative disease.</p>
<p>First of all, in terms of symptoms, degenerative disease has the following three special signs: First, spiritual distortion. Patients with degenerative disease are usually unable to cheer up their spirits, but at the same time, they constantly waste their energy in a life of "groaning without illness." These people often put on a depressed and melancholy face of "a heartbroken person has other feelings," adapting to all objective natural and human problems with the mood of grieving for autumn and cherishing spring, crying for flowers and mourning the moon. What he most hopes for is "May the flowers always be beautiful, the moon always be round, people always live long, and the years always be abundant," but the development of reality is precisely the opposite of his hopes. So, he can't help but be overcome with grief! The subjective archetype of male degenerative disease sufferers is people like Jia Changsha and Li Changji, and the subjective "model" of female degenerative disease sufferers is Lin Daiyu! These people often seem to have the sorrows of a country broken, a family destroyed, and a vast life, but they are indifferent to the splitting of the four northeastern provinces and the large-scale attacks of imperialism. Second, sensual pleasure. "Life is like a dream, how much happiness can there be?" is the motto that degenerative disease sufferers unanimously rejoice in: "Pure wine and women, fearing that they will not be available," is the lifestyle practiced by most degenerative disease sufferers. He indulges in gambling at the "turntable," dances in the dance hall until "unaware of the dawn in the east," buys a dollar's worth of "Yun Gao" to smoke himself into a daze, and various other pleasure methods aimed at exchanging temporary or momentary anesthesia and stimulation of nerves and senses. In the life of every degenerative disease sufferer, there is one or "all-around" "tireless enjoyment" in any aspect. Third, "don't care about tomorrow" and dissatisfaction with everything. Self-anesthesia and sensual pleasure are themselves the second step in the development of "don't care about tomorrow." "Get drunk today if you have wine today" and "Tonight we can only talk about the wind and the moon" are even more "heretical mantras" often recited by many degenerates when "forgetting their worries with joy." Secondly, degenerative disease sufferers almost always take a negative or "scornful" attitude towards everything. For example, although he himself is being attacked by sexual hunger, but when he sees others in love, he piously reprimands them as "impulses of animal lust"; when he sees people looking for a job, he sarcastically calls them "slaves of life"; when talking about politics, he indiscriminately dismisses them as "leading beasts to eat people"; when talking about political parties, his opinion is: The word "party" contains "still" and "black", how can there be good ones? When talking about resisting Japan and opposing imperialism, they think it is "wanting to show off" or "being used by others". In short, everything in the eyes of degenerative disease sufferers is "stupid" and "terrible". However, degenerates themselves never want to think about, say, or do things that are "not stupid" or "not terrible"! Patients with degenerative disease invariably seek anesthesia and stimulation, but anesthesia and stimulation can only temporarily obscure reality for him. As a result, when the anesthetic properties disappear, he is still cruelly whipped by the pressure of reality. Therefore, the degenerative disease itself is a kind of chronic suicide, and the sudden and dramatic changes in degenerative disease often develop into actual suicide.</p>
<p>Secondly, we trace the source of degenerative disease. The objective reason, of course, is that the semi-colonial social economy is increasingly bankrupt and the long-term turmoil and unrest in the whole of China give young people too many opportunities to encounter obstacles. The subjective reason is that the degenerative disease patient himself does not have enough understanding of the problems of life and society and lacks the courage to grasp reality and struggle hard.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to prescribe a "self-healing" "prescription" for friends suffering from degenerative disease:</p>
<p>First, use all the spirit of groaning without illness and the sigh of "talented people (or "beautiful women") have a short life" on analyzing problems and dealing with problems. Basically, you must recognize that in this world that you think is boring, you still have to continue to live in most cases. Since you want to live, you must make life richer and more reasonable.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of personal daily life, it must be made very tight and orderly. In terms of the relationship between people, you must make yourself more in contact with the masses, from monotonous to collectivized or massified. Because the deep penetration of people in degenerative disease often comes from the "leisure" and loneliness of life.</p>
<p>Third, open your eyes, recognize the era and environment you are in, and establish your own fighting outlook on life from a materialist worldview and social outlook.</p>
<p>This world simply does not have surplus rice and bread to feed many degenerates or no reserves. Therefore, I advise all degenerates: "Quickly turn back!"</p>
<h3>Toilet</h3>
<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>The toilet is a place that doesn't make people very happy, but you have to approach it from time to time. When a person arrives in the toilet, it is indeed very boring, not as exciting as going to the theater or a restaurant; but a kind of leisurely and comfortable attitude is enough to refresh one's spirits. We are busy all day long for life and career, so busy that we can't get away; once we step into the toilet, our body and mind are relaxed for the most part, and we can immediately get a few minutes of peace and quiet. Or hold a cigarette in your mouth, slowly inhale and exhale, and stare intently at the ever-changing smoke rings in front of you. Or hold your head in both hands, carefully savoring the sweet aftertaste of the past. In this state, no matter how unhappy you are, you have to temporarily throw away all the pain in the world.</p>
<p>If you are willing to pay attention and observe quietly, in the toilet, we can always discover many strange and bizarre scenes, which will make a smile float on the corner of your mouth. Works of art are often appreciated. An extremely simple turtle composed of a few strokes, or three or five strangely shaped human figures, and vulgar sentences such as "A person is at the guest's center, the home is at the heart," these are the masterpieces of several unknown painters and poets. "Amu is being detained," "Adai eats rice and dung," the surrounding whitewashed walls have become bulletin boards for children to attack each other, which is truly beautiful and full of fun! Not only that, in recent years, the toilet has also become a place for writing slogans. The competition of doctrines has even reached the toilet, which is quite peculiar! Slogans such as "Down with the ×× Party", "Long live ××ism", and "Support the ×× Government" are everywhere. This is another achievement of a group of unknown revolutionary activists. These forms can be grabbed as good tricks for us to pass the time.</p>
<p>As for a generation of studious bookworms, they can also make great efforts by taking advantage of the time they spend in the toilet; holding a book in their hands, concentrating and reading one word after another. This is also a way to burn the midnight oil, and the benefits should be considerable. It is said that several famous Chinese and foreign scholars obtained part of their knowledge from the toilet.</p>
<p>Some people, when they meet familiar friends in the toilet, they have to talk loudly and eloquently. The topics of conversation here are very casual and broad, sometimes starting from pulling the flush and talking all the way to issues such as eating, love, politics, international affairs, life and death.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of person who can sleep soundly in the toilet. But this is very dangerous, if you fall down, it's no joke!</p>

<h3>Behind Vanity</h3>
<p>— Xiaoying</p>
<p>It is said that a monk in Jiaoshan, Zhenjiang, once analyzed the busyness of the world, believing that the motivation lies in fame and fortune, and the two are parallel and diverge. However, if we further investigate the motivation for people's pursuit of fame, there are no Yi and Qi who starved to death in Shouyang Mountain in this world. As for the so-called famous officials and great men, who would dare to say that they are not engaging in the mutual exploitation of interests?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiyun discussed vanity in this publication yesterday, attributing all the evils in the world to vanity, believing that if people did not embrace vanity and paid attention to practical benefits and utilitarianism, the world would be at peace. However, this may be too optimistic! Most people in the world wear plain clothes and eat simple food, but their actions are still the same set of pursuing selfishness and self-interest. In addition to increasing a group of true villains who are unwilling to contribute even a hair, only hypocrites are eliminated, and what benefit does it bring to the world?</p>
<p>Naturally, Mr. Jiyun's premise is this: because of vanity, expenditures are large; because expenditures are large, they commit crimes and collect money, leading to self-harm and harm to others. If we ask further, why be vain? That is definitely not just because they want to make their wives and concubines proud, or sit in a black-plated car and watch pedestrians. The motivation is not just reversing the cause and effect, it is precisely for the sake of committing crimes. Tell Mr. Jiyun! It is definitely not vanity that drives unscrupulous merchants. However, those unscrupulous merchants who desperately pursue the vanity of a piece of empty committee title are actually trying to cover themselves up with some so-called social status!</p>
<p>Humans are the spirit of all things, especially in the so-called bad aspects. Every move, every smile, in this commodified stage of real society, flirting and showing off is not limited to prostitutes who are despised. It can even be said that everyone has become a prostitute. The so-called "speak human language to people, speak ghost language to ghosts" in the philosophy of life, is it not the meaning of a shallow smile by the wine pot?</p>
<p>The author is not a so-called pessimistic person who hates the world, but wants to expose the overly optimistic attitude of reforming the heart and improving society, so he believes that the new advice to the world to not have vanity, without understanding what is behind vanity, is a futile thing. This is an inevitable fact. It is as fruitless to preach frugality to celebrities as it is to preach not killing to tigers. Maybe they will even laugh at you for being too naive! "How can I be fond of vanity? I have no choice!" This sentence is also a bit of truth.</p>
<p>In this era, it is absolutely impossible to dream of Peach Blossom Spring again. No one can show the temperament of not bending the waist for five pecks of rice. Rice cannot be obtained more and more like air. Even if you go your own way, people only recognize clothes and hats and not people. Morality cannot be practiced without skills, and vanity has long been regarded as a great skill.</p>
<p>I oppose vanity, and I will never advocate vanity. However, understanding what is behind vanity, I know that abandoning the root and pursuing the branches will not only fail to get rid of vanity, but also cause you to run into walls. To put it in a fashionable way, this is related to the fundamental problem.</p>
<h3>Seeking Benevolence and Obtaining Benevolence, What is There to Complain About?"</h3>
<p>— Qiongsheng</p>
<p>China has always given praise to the tragic ending of heroes and righteous people since ancient times, but I don't understand it.</p>
<p>For example, Taishi Gong's Biography of Boyi says: "Boyi and Shuqi were the two sons of the monarch of Guzhu. The father wanted to establish Shuqi. When the father died, Shuqi gave way to Boyi. Boyi said, 'It is the father's order,' and then fled away. Shuqi also refused to be established and fled. The people of the country established the middle son. Then Boyi and Shuqi heard that Xibo Chang was good at supporting the elderly, and went to return to him. When they arrived, Xibo died, and King Wu carried a wooden tablet and called himself King Wen, and attacked Zhou to the east. Boyi and Shuqi knocked on the horse and advised him, saying: 'Is it filial to not bury the father when he dies and use weapons of war? Is it benevolent to kill the ruler with a subject?'...After King Wu had pacified the Yin chaos, the world followed Zhou, but Boyi and Shuqi were ashamed of it, and righteously refused to eat Zhou millet, hid in Shouyang Mountain, picked weeds and ate them, and starved to death." Reading this passage, at least it is indignant and laments that Boyi and Shuqi died unjustly. They didn't want to be good emperors, ran away to join King Wu, who was not very bright, and eventually starved to death. However, Confucius, who "considered himself benevolent and righteous," greatly praised them, saying: "Boyi and Shuqi did not remember old evils, and resentment was therefore rare. Seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about?" These words came from the mouth of Confucius, who traveled around the countries like the current "national heroes," "celebrities," and "masters," and everywhere people held welcome meetings and donated money. I think he is extremely sarcastic and cold-blooded!</p>
<p>Just as Confucius' "benevolence, righteousness, and morality" still dominate people's hearts and are considered the "national character" of China, his sarcastic and cold-blooded attitude has also been maintained to this day. Jiang Minsheng fought bloodily with the enemy for many years, and now has to engage in the industry of wiping shoes for a living. Liang Tongfang, as a leader of an anti-Japanese army, actually lives by walking with people. Resisters are like this, and non-resisters are like that. No matter what, it is regrettable, but some people praise it as a "glorious ending," a "self-reliant" "heroic quality," which has the same meaning as sitting next to an electric stove in winter and watching the laborers struggling in the cold wind on the street, and praising them for having a "spirit of enduring hardship."</p>
<p>But then again, saying this does not mean that "anti-Japanese heroes" must be commanders-in-chief, commanders, or chairmen, and must be so before they are happy. Boyi and Shuqi valued etiquette and lightness and had their own "seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence" intention, which does not need to be criticized. However, there are those who "reside in benevolence and do not give way," such as the warlord Liu Bei, who seized Xichuan, and they feel that Boyi and Shuqi were too stupid and should not have been. King Wu's replacing Zhou was really "using violence to replace violence." As a result, resisting by refusing to eat Zhou millet and starving to death in Shouyang was an even more sinful passive attitude. When the Northeast Volunteer Army rose up, from fundraising teams and support associations to hundreds of thousands of "destroying homes and contributing to the disaster," gathering small amounts to make a fur coat was quite a large number. However, there were many people who were both "famous" and "substantial" as "patriots who saved the country." This was originally like speculation in the stock exchange. Jiang Minsheng and Liang Tongfang may not have understood this at that time, which led to their "exhaustion," and they could not travel to Western Europe after the "anti-Japanese war was successful." Returning home to visit mountains and scenic spots amid a crowd of welcomes is enough to show that they are not very clever. Clever people will say that stupid people are "commendable for their loyalty and bravery." Therefore, people who have made a fortune in the "anti-Japanese" stock exchange, with their pockets full, said to Jiang Minsheng and Liang Tongfang in a tone that superficially praised but was actually sarcastic and cold-blooded, imitating "seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about?": "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world. When the country is in trouble, stand up and act as a bulwark. Once the disaster is removed, remove the armor and return to the fields, shining shoes is a profession, pulling a rickshaw is a profession, labor is sacred, what is there to be humiliated about, not taking credit, not seeking reward, this is the true color of a hero." It is highly doubtful whether the disaster has been removed. Whether the action of "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world" has been treated as goods and is being traded on the "anti-Japanese" stock exchange must be carefully considered. As for saying that not seeking reward or taking credit is the true color of a hero, Jiang and Liang must have hidden themselves in Shouyang Mountain and picked weeds to eat in order to be the most "noble" when they saw the current national territory shrinking and instead talked about friendship! However, that would be too stupid.</p>
<p>In this society where everything has been commodified, the "heroic" cause of loving the country and "resisting Japan" cannot escape this law. The various forms of saving the country that are still going on now show this sign. Many truly "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world" people are sold out under this form. Some "heroes" who are both "famous" and "substantial" praise fools with grand-sounding "noble personalities" and wag their seductive tongues. Yes, in order to avoid the general public from becoming "indignant," the more people who righteously refuse to eat Zhou millet and starve to death in Shouyang, the better. However, there are few such people in China. Therefore, the saying of praising fools as "commendable for their loyalty and bravery" is just right. Jiang Minsheng and Liang Tongfang are, after all, heroic qualities, "seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about?"</p>
<p>However, I feel that it is extremely sarcastic and cold-blooded.</p>

<h3>Fragments of Childhood Memories (10)</h3>
<p>— Liehuo</p>
<p>After waiting for a quarter of an hour, I finally went to the front of the cattle pen with a sad face, staring blankly at a very large golden-yellow bull. My mother saw that I hadn't started yet and hurried forward, "The sun has already come out of the mountains, why aren't you leading the cow away? Good boy, listen to me, go! When you come back, I'll give you a bowl of egg fried rice. Your fourth brother didn't have this kind of blessing when he herded cows. Go quickly!" My mother said a lot of words early in the morning, but they couldn't match the pleasantness of the sentence "When you come back, I'll give you a bowl of egg fried rice." I panicked. Suddenly, half of his head appeared on the bottom of the pond, and I couldn't help laughing. Then he drew a few circles in the center of the pond and told me to go into the water. I went into the water. Then he taught me a few swimming poses: "Close your mouth, lower your head, and use your strength evenly." After speaking, I lowered my body to try, and the results were not bad. Although I couldn't help but panic and struggle a bit the first few times, I couldn't swim very far. But after practicing for several afternoons in a row, my hands and feet became proficient. I learned to float, and I also learned to float upside down. And I felt that this kind of floating was more energy-saving, and I could swim across the pond with a diameter of more than ten feet in one breath. It's just that I still couldn't swim. I couldn't stay in the water for more than a minute before I had to rush out to breathe because I felt very suffocated.</p>
<p>Because I had to swim every afternoon, I tied the cow rope to the tree trunk, so that the bull circled around the tree, without the freedom to go far, so as not to eat the vegetables in other people's vegetable gardens or the rice in the fields and cause trouble.</p>
<p>This news spread to my mother's ears a few days later, and my father also knew about it.</p>
<p>"You wild brat, I heard that you've been swimming in the pond for the past few days. It doesn't matter if you drown, but you've made the fat cow thin again. You wild brat!" My father glared at me and scolded me, luckily he didn't hit me.</p>
<p>"I told you not to play in the water, but you lied to me and went. What will you do if you drown! Blind He said you have to be especially careful in July!" My mother only said these two sentences in her kind smile.</p>
<p>The next day, I didn't get up until tea time (Note 8). I knew that the job of herding cows had been transferred to my fourth brother again.</p>
<p>June 10, 1931, in Jiangwan.</p>
<p>(Note 1) is a kind of medicine for stomach pain, (Note 2) means the innate constitution, (Note 3) means invisible, (Note 4) is the local name for pine needles, (Note 5) is a local saying to describe people with no achievements, (Note 6) refers to ordinary family letters, (Note 8) In rural society, there are no clocks, only knowing that it is 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., saying that it is time to drink tea, so the time is called tea time, and 11:00 a.m. is called wine time.

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3>About "Constructive Criticism"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Liu Huanan's "Respectfully to Movie Critics" on the 16th made me personally feel the importance of my responsibility. Since I am someone who often writes film criticism, I inevitably recognize that I have a close relationship with Chinese films. However, due to my own superficiality, I often feel that I cannot fulfill my duties. Now that Mr. Liu has raised such a significant request, it makes me feel infinitely apprehensive.</p>
<p>Regarding the "constructive criticism" raised by Mr. Liu, I believe that friends who write film criticism should acknowledge the correctness of this issue. In any case, the critic himself is a researcher of film. Therefore, the critic and the author should do their best to seek the progress of Chinese films. At the same time, critics also have the responsibility to faithfully introduce everything about the film to the audience. This is not only to guide the audience on how to appreciate art, but also to make the audience aware of the author's creative intentions. Especially with regard to the former, the audience urgently needs to know the methods or techniques of film creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to accepting Mr. Liu's suggestion, I have the above-mentioned supplements. The so-called "constructive criticism" not only helps Chinese film authors, but also helps Chinese film audiences. Especially in the current situation where the understanding of the general audience is too weak, everyone engaged in film culture is deeply worried about this. Therefore, constructive criticism has a greater significance in this aspect.</p>
<p>Now, I concretely put forward the following opinions to make this proposal a reality.</p>
<p>The editor of this publication should specially invite a number of experts to, in addition to the general criticism of each new film, also bring up a certain part of a film for everyone to study. For example, everyone admits that the drama component of "Spring Silkworms" is too small. This is of course a failure of the playwright. Then we might as well conduct a detailed exploration of the script. Similarly, we acknowledge that the directors of "慈母恨" or "絕塞情鴻" are very good, and we can also engage in in-depth research. Other aspects such as the makeup of "Wax Museum Mystery," the performance of "Gold Mountain," the set design of "Grand Hotel," or the cinematography and sound recording in other films, are all materials for our research. Of course, we do not have to explore only Chinese films, but the main focus is still on Chinese films. At the same time, we do not have to limit ourselves to existing films. We can even offer opinions to the authors after some research on films that are about to be produced but have not yet started. For example, I think they would be happy to accept our design for the Lianxing Company's adaptation of "Roar, China!" Other things like the "三友式" recorder during the trial period, we can also use this as an opportunity to conduct a study in terms of academic theory.</p>
<p>This is not only of great benefit to film authors, but also readers will definitely feel interested, and the level of appreciation will be improved imperceptibly. Especially since foreign films do not have Chinese versions, there is too much isolation for the audience. If we can translate the dialogues of some films, it would not be a waste of effort. Moreover, introducing the scripts of famous films in general has considerable value.</p>
<p>The above is respectfully offered to the editor of this publication and to those engaged in film culture.</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3>Review of "龍馬精神" Great Decision</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>丨Produced by RKO Pictures·Showing in Nanjing丨</p>
<p>This story takes place in the American countryside. The director has fulfilled his responsibility to portray the countryside very well.</p>
<p>The peace of the countryside is surrounded by the smiling faces of everyone in a small shop. Although they are all being harassed by robbers, everyone is still calm and peaceful. However, what is written here is not like "Peach Blossom Spring" in that the countryside is idealized for no reason. What is gratifying is that it truly grasps the simple atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are worldly old people, loyal young people, and affectionate young girls. ... We can see from the scenes where the old man burns the food he is toasting in his hand, the young man buys a piece of bread with all his money, and then receives the box of tobacco from the old man, and the young lovers talk about the milk bottle, etc., that the author is doing his best to show his cleverness.</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, it is still a mediocre work. Although we see the author handling the plot in a fairly delicate way, the grasp of the two climaxes is not strong enough. When the robber forces Tony to become a thief, Tony dies at the hands of the thief, and when his wife and children see the corpse and start crying, we imagine that it must be very tragic, but in fact these few shots fail. This is of course because the actress who plays the mother is too mediocre, and the director cannot remedy it. In addition, although the last climax made the air tense due to the dense gunfire, the old man and the young man were always calm and composed, exaggerating the so-called composure in battle. In this way, the audience feels unreal about the picture.</p>
<p>In this scene, the director is of course responsible for the biggest part, but the two roles playing the old man and the young man did not remedy this shortcoming. Charles Sale, who plays the old man, had excellent results in "生意經". His humorous and lively acting skills make us never forget him. But here we see him trying his best to show the appearance of an old hero, which is not an easy task, so it is not as pleasing to us as "生意經". Bill Boyd has the reputation of "黨人魂", and later also showed a rough and handsome air in "畫舫情痕". But here, there is no special brilliance at all. At best, he is only fulfilling his duties, and he is no different from ordinary mediocre roles.</p>
<p>The mediocre performance is naturally determined by the mediocre story. Here, because the countryside is to be written about being robbed, it is inevitable to create a group of robbers. And this group of robbers are also born evil people. Therefore, it reminds us of the statement in "鐵板紅淚錄" that bandits are produced because of "officials forcing people to rebel," which is indeed pointed out after the author has grasped the economic structure. As for the love interspersed in this work, it is very simple and makes people feel real.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>My View of "蠻荒之花"</h3>
<p>— Yin Zhong</p>
<p>The appearance of foreign "beast films" contains a special and significant meaning. It is used as a propaganda tool for conquering barbaric nations and expanding their colonies. However, the emergence of "beast films" in our country is different in its significance, and there is no significance whatsoever in it. Moreover, the general audience in our country does not understand its significance. They just want to "have fun." Under these circumstances, it goes without saying that foreign beast films are warmly welcomed, and domestic beast films are produced by taking advantage of this point.</p>
<p>However, what exactly is the content and technique of "蛮荒之花," a domestic beast film that has recently been released?</p>
<p>First, let's talk about its content. It is about a pair of unmarried young men and women traveling to Africa, where they encounter terrible beasts and fight with them. Needless to say, this is of course fake. In fact, Chinese people do not even dare to go to their own border areas such as Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang. How dare they run to Africa, a foreign country with poisonous snakes and beasts?</p>
<p>We know that "beast films" are somewhat realistic and journalistic. They are not like other films that can be manufactured artificially. So where does the African background in this film come from? Needless to say, it is copied from foreign films again. Therefore, the completion of this film only relies on the skill of editing. Unfortunately, the editing skill is not very clever, so it is inevitable to reveal flaws, which is the responsibility of the director.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, the acting skills of the two male and female protagonists are commendable. Compared to the previous film "荒島野人," it is much better. "Omitted below"</p>
<h3>My Opinion of "蠻荒之花"</h3>
<p>— Shen Gong</p>
<p>The Shanghai film market, which is being occupied by foreign beast films, actually has this "蠻荒之花" domestic beast film. In any case, it is worth taking a breath in terms of competition.</p>
<p>Although beast films are made for the general curious audience, good beast films can also show the difficulty of the filming process and the ability of the technology. For example, films such as "人猿泰山" and "龍虎鬥" can give the audience considerable satisfaction.</p>
<p>They have capital and go to Africa to shoot various strange scenes to use as materials on the screen. We suffer from insufficient capital, so we have to put things together from the East and the West. The value of the concept is not to be discussed, but what is the meaning of the technology? It only shows the clever editing skills!</p>
<p>The themes inevitably have far-fetched parts in order to suit the plot of the film. Is Africa a scenic spot in the world? Why go there for travel? This is completely inexplicable. The barbarian king seems to be as civilized as civilized people and knows about benevolence and righteousness, so he cannot be a barbarian king.</p>
<p>Lions and tigers have long been tired of watching by general curious audiences in many previous foreign films, so they cannot arouse any interest. As for the scene of killing a snake, what is seen in Clara Bow's "野性" Call Her Savage is much more terrifying, but in the "蠻荒之花" film, it is really not easy to support a realistic scene, and it can be regarded as a successful part.</p>
<p>The director's arrangement is relatively lacking in some places and acceptable in others. As for the scenery of Africa, it is originally the skill of other people, so of course it can make people admire it. Among the actors, He Zhigang is the most skilled and can be very competent. Xu Suzhen is also not bad. The other actors can also satisfy people. Especially the performance in several terrifying shots is very realistic.</p>
<h3>Tang Xiaodan is a Candidate for the Groom</h3>
<p>Li Yun's marriage has sparked talk about marriage in Tianyi Company, and this time Yu Guang, Tang Xiaodan, who were invited to be male bridesmaids, and Lu Lixia and Hu Shan, who were female bridesmaids, have become the center of the discussion. It is said that Yu Guang is already married, and Lu Lixia has long been assigned to Wang Chunyuan. We don't know about Hu Shan. We only know that Lao Tang is still a virgin. Therefore, on the next wedding banquet reservation form, everyone wrote Xiaodan's name. But, who is Lao Tang's target? What day will it be? No one can say for sure. Therefore, Tang Xiaodan has become a candidate for the groom.</p>
<h3>Movie Novel Fragrant Grass Beauty (1)</h3>
<p>— Tian Fu</p>
<p>Star Film Company Production, Chen Kengran Director, Ma Wenyuan Screenwriter, Actors丨In order of appearance: Xie Yunqing, Xia Peizhen, Wang Zhengxin, Tan Zhiyuan, Gu Lanjun, Xu Xinyuan, Xiao Yingyan, Gong Shang (1) Prologue</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai is the "den of all evils." The deformed system of society constantly creates many criminals, but then uses something called law to deal with them.</p>
<p>The courthouse is always so lively: batches of criminals are brought in. Then they are interrogated: Why did you commit the crime? Then they ask the "criminal law" doctor to cure the "disease" of crime. Why commit crimes? Let's look at the process of one person's crime! He is one of thousands of criminals: His name is Wang A'da.</p>
<p>(2) Gospel of Life</p>
<p>In the factory of the Da Zhonghua Tobacco Company, there is a large group of people busy making a living there. Clang, clang, clang! They are nailing wooden boxes with all their might: as if their existence is only for nailing wooden boxes.</p>
<p>The tense atmosphere stirred a little, a foreman said: "The company's second branch has been established, and it needs to add more than two thousand male and female workers; if you have relatives and friends, you can introduce them!"</p>
<p>This news spread in everyone's hearts, stirring up a wave of joy. Wang A'da thought of his wife, daughter, and young brother in the countryside, and his heart was moved. So, he registered them with the management office.</p>
<p>Things went so smoothly and luckily, Wang A'da's family's livelihood was easily solved in this way. The wife is in the boxing room, the daughter is in the leaf-picking room, and the brother is pushing and transporting large barrels of tobacco leaves in the warehouse, he has the strength of an ox.</p>
<p>Tall, dark chimneys, coal and fire in the boiler room, the rumbling wheels of the blending room, the knives of the cutting room, the hundreds of anemic hands in the cigarette rolling room... Wang A'da's family lived in such a living environment, but they were very satisfied. Busy during the day, sleeping peacefully at night, sometimes waking up laughing from dreams.</p>
<p>The one-story house, costing a dozen dollars a month, was rented. Although hard work, they were full every day. They lived so peacefully for a year.</p>
<p>(3) Flickering Lamp</p>
<p>Small street, a noisy atmosphere. Small flags with "Please smoke domestic cigarettes, produced by Da Zhonghua Tobacco Company, buy one box get one free" written on them fluttered in the east wind.</p>
<p>The salesman was desperately cranking the hand organ, desperately holding up the loudspeaker and shouting wildly. His mouth was dry from shouting, and people watching the excitement looked at him and left empty-handed.</p>
<p>Small street, a noisy atmosphere. Small flags with "Good tobacco shreds, cheap price, genuinely fair foreign goods" written on them fluttered.</p>
<p>The salesman was desperately cranking the hand organ, desperately holding up the loudspeaker and shouting wildly. His mouth was dry from shouting, and the cigarettes on the cart were almost sold out. (To be continued)</p>
