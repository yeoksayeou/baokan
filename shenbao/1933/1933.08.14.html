<p>半月以來。黄河水患日益嚴重。七月之末陕境各水。因伏汎而齊漲。涇渭旣毁其渠道。黄河上流。亦有暴漲之報。陕災雖成。範圍尙不甚大。及八月初。黄河上中下三流水位增高。適其時冀境長垣。因軍隊勦匪。匪偷毁河堤二口。水淹農村。災象頗慘。延及魯省。恐怖之區域乃漸廣。近則豫西汜温各縣河水出槽。滎澤水溢堤外。及於鄭州。洪水東趨侵迫開封。有入淤黄河之趨勢蘭封業已受災。北則山東之李升屯。東則江蘇西北各縣。俱有不可終日之象。水災之威脅。範圍已及四五省區。不僅中原之報災已也。</p>
<p>談黄河水利者。謂自前清光緖十三年（一八八七）以後。四十餘年來。河槽穩定。汎濫無聞大有日就軌範之勢。夫黄河河面。高於兩岸平地。水災之烈著聞中外。即就清代二百六十七年而言。决口三十九次。蓋在光緒十三年以前。每六年必有一次水災。其近四十餘年來所以汎濫無聞者。據水利專家所言。雖由於陽武堤及平漢鐵路護橋壩。使河流漸有軌道。沿岸護崖石。使河岸漸固。而最大之原因。則爲豫西各支流流域引河水灌田者日多。渠道縱横。足以减少黄河流量。上流荒地。逐年開墾。使雨水大部分。未入黄河先爲新墾地所吸收。惟此項開渠灌田。墾地吸水。初非有意爲水利而辦之事。故不能根本以銷除黄河之水害。且河流自滎澤而東。河身高於平地之度數。逐漸增加。至蘭封附近。地始漸高於河。而此一大段間。實未有若何裨益水利之事業。爲吾人所聞知。雖然。吾人鑒於豫西及上流開渠墾荒之間接的能减少黄河水害。在此水災恐怖之中。不得不希望黄河流域各省官吏。一面努力獎勵此項事業之發展。以增加其防災之效力。一面更就未曾辦有此項事業之各縣。督勵地方人士。繼起興辦。庶渠道日多。黄河水勢可减。而吸收水量之地面漸增。河水能免於横决爲害也。</p>
<p>往者長江水災恐怖之中。吾人曾竭其呼籲之聲爲沿江各省人民請命矣。幸而江水日漸自落。巨災得免。今數日以來。中央水利機關及各省當局。集議防災賑濟。辦理搶險工事。舊事循環。紛忙殊甚。吾人似不必複述舊文。惟望於幸而得免巨災以後。從事根本之水利事業耳。</p>

<h3 id="c161">防空 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 花齡</p>
<p>據說·世界第二次大戰，大家要［高來高去］，來一個［雲端裹厮殺］，所以意大利飛機，巡禮到了時家谷美國人便受了極大的剌激。日本人能在二分鐘内，防空軍隊能爬到屋頂上去，在全市黑暗之中，開放高射砲，兀是自覺夠防空的安全。而且據說，下次大戰時，扔幾穎燒夷彈，五百鎊的重量炸彈，還不算好漢，要賣弄法寳，得玩玩［毒瓦斯彈］。</p>
<p>［高來高去］，自然甚麽都便宜。飛機，高射砲，同故宫古物，同樣珍惜寳貴的中國，日本飛機，好不感武。但觀於這次東京防空演習的那回子事，三架［假想敵］的［假想飛機］，從從容容地來，得意洋洋地去，防軍錢躱在屋頂上放高射砲，却没打下一些［戰利品］來，倒反而發現了人民避難處太少，自來水火管的埋得太淺的危險。日本對於太平洋對岸的［假想敵］，抱着極度的不安，却不料太平洋西岸的［日本假想敵］，鑒於意大利飛機的成功，也正大躭其心事，可知駕了飛機，到人家領空裹去［撒爛屎］，還是比較的容昜，要使敵機［撒］不下［爛屎］，或是不敢來［撒爛屎］，儘掻頭摸耳，可就有些難。</p>
<p>防空演習之下，防空軍對於［燒夷彈］，已有些招架不住，若將來眞玩起［毒瓦斯彈］來，雖然每人嘴上套着香烟罐，或者考究些兒，牛羊貓狗的臉上，都帶着防毒面具，但這些［賊出關門］的辦法，究竟是嚇不退敵機，而且更没有把敵機充［戰利品］，而陳列的能耐。所以所謂［防空］也者，我以爲也不過是那麽一回事。</p>
<p>的爽快。</p>

<h3 id="c163">摩登婦女的修飾要訣（上） <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>現代的　女們，不論東西各國，在内體上應當具備的修　要件，是燙頭髮，　　毛，塗嘴唇，染指甲　，　爲必不可少的。燙髮的式樣，我已在前月說過了，現在把　局毛，塗嘴唇，染指甲三種，詳細的介紹一下，大凡尙摩豋的婦女們，明白了這要訣，到處可以大出風頭爲人垂靑了。</p>
<p>畫眉的要訣</p>
<p>訣　訣畫眉與塗唇，爲化妝中最難的手術，倘若妝飾得不合直，不但　不止妍艷，反而露出醜形，减少本來的美感，這是我們在應酬地方，跳舞塲中，常常見到的。然崦要怎麽樣，能夠增加美艷呢？簡單的說起，無論何人，應當忖度五宫的樣子，再把缺點修正，那末就可以保持原有的風采，增加特殊的妍　了。譬如額廣眼大　　的人，若是描以細長的眉，就大不適宜。額形秀　眼臉尖小兩頰平扁的人，畫上鬱曲細長的眉毛，那可以增加特别的美感。現今全世界最流行的，有六種眉：第一種呌做「黛德麗」（德國女明星名）眉，眉頭向下，眉尾斜上眉線由粗而細的，第二種呌做「八字」眉·眉頭没有尖角，照眼臉平行彎曲的。第三種呌做「柳葉」眉，好像一片柳葉的形式，由鼻邊的眼角，向上歪斜的。第四種呌做「地藏」眉，眉線鬱度不大，眉頭在上，漸漸斜至眉梢。第五種呌做「蛾眉」，好像蠶蛾的眉形。第六種呌做「波紋」眉，眉線　而短。以上六種眉形，都須用手術把原有眉毛地位修改移動，而且依照各人的五官地位，與額的廣狹，眼的大小平斜，鼻的長短高低，兩眼問的距離，眉與髮相差的遠近等，酌量繪　。普通面孔細長的人，鼻樑高狹的人，眼小而最的人，以繪地藏眉，爲最適宜。若是　面孔的人，要繪八字眉，才能顯出妍麗，因爲圓而孔的人，頭髮與眉，相距很近，若是眉的地位，不移到適宜的地方，那面孔一見愈覺短闊了。額狹面長的人，若是繪了粗而短的波紋眉，更覺其面孔之長了。所以選繪眉毛，切切要斟酌本人的面形地位以及五官的距離等，大凡外國的婦女們，到了化妝店裨去修飾的時候，他們先請化妝師指出五官的缺點，再斟酌地位，選　那一種眉形的，現在上海的摩豋婦女們，他們不明白自已的缺點，祗管效法他人，亂豐眉形，於是把原來的風采，减色了不少，這一點應請特别注意啊！</p>
<p>塗唇的要訣</p>
<p>唇的摩力，在電影中，已完全表現出来，世界上男女愛情的熱度，到了最高的時候，那男女的唇，必定了覺的，好像磁石與石與鐵一樣，互相吸引，所以唇化妝，關係尤爲重大。從前我國古代的婦女們，只曉得用臙脂塗抺，當時所謂櫻桃紅，就是用臙脂在上下兩唇上中間，搽了像櫻桃形的紅點，這櫻桃紅頗能引起人的美感，到了現在，從西方傳來的滿唇紅樣式，若是不懂秘訣，必定露出極難看的醜態。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十三回　棄職見知音佳人默許　承家得來者健兒狂歡</p>
<p>二人出了店門，各自先後回營。到了次日正午，關耀武就到楊家去拜訪楊老太。他在院子裏只呌了一聲大姨，就聽到江氏在屋子裏答道：請進來罷。我算着你也就該來了。關耀武聽着，倒吃上驚，我今天要來·他怎麽倒會知道呢？他掀了簾子進去，江氏就讓到裹面屋坐下。關耀武笑道：大姨好／我事忙，短來探望您，我們表妹呢／江氏微笑道；躱開了。關耀武更是納悶了，憑什麽他要躱開呢？江氏在小棹子抽屜裹。拿出一盒烟捲來。那烟捲包還不曾開封，分明是新買來的。他在屋子中間，放的白爐子沿上，提起一把舊瓷壺，斟了一杯茶，放到棹子上。看那茶的顏色，也是新煎的。一切都是新有的設備，下像是碰上這個機會的，想明白了，那就是江氏母女知道自已要來了。他們何以會知道呢？這倒奇怪了。這就笑問江氏道：聽說您到北京城裹去玩了一躺，您多久不去了，城裹情形，有些不同了吧？江氏道：大致也還差不離。我說表哥，你是個忙人，咱們是親戚，有話總好商量。你不是想喝我們丫頭那碗冬瓜湯嗎？乾脆，你就說你的來意罷。關耀武笑道：你旣是都猜着了，我還有什麽不承認的。我原來聽說大姨對這門親事，已經是贊成了的，後來怎麽又冷淡下來了呢？江氏坐在靠窗户的一張方凳上，於是掀開小玻璃塊上貼的活紙，向外面看了一看。看過之後，就低聲向關耀武笑道：這一段原因，你不也很明白嗎？就是爲了當軍人的，在外的日子多。再說，雖是可以望到將來升官發財，可是這種差事，究竟也没有别種差事穩當。（一五七）</p>
<h3 id="c165">都市縮影 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>角子上聚集着一羣生路上的小英雄，他們爲了權利的嚷奪，像軍閥爭地盤一樣；在水門汀上，就窮兇極惡的火併起來。小小的拳頭揮舞着，熱汗從他們汚穢的皮膚上淌下來；在胸前印上幾條墨黑的痕跡。斜角裹走出來一個半摩登的女人，伊把眼光叮住了這兩條火併的英雄；就喝住他們的爭門。「小赤老，當心告訴你家爺叔去。」兩個正打得難分難捨的小英雄，就停住了手嘻着臉靠在對面巷口的牆角上沉默着。這比較廢止内戰大同盟的宣言，要有力最的多。</p>
<p>一個畸形的乞丐，在行人如織的地上拱着手，裝出一付尷𠆷的哭臉：求一般少爺小姐們的賜捨。一會　銅元就積滿了一大堆，遠遠的帝邊一個類似的白相人，穿着印度綢的短衫褲，把高領頭剝下了袒露着胸膛。他走到乞丐的面前，把銅元搬到了另一邊；把舊新聞紙包裹着。有人說：「這是上海有一種人的職業，遠勝一般終日勞働的工人。」</p>
<p>電車站上，時常有幾個六七歲的孩子，偎住你的胸口。要你買一張夜報。「先生，謝謝儂，買一張好不？」有許多人他原先是不預備買報的，時常因此而掏出錢來。朋友對我說：「這是有人指使的。」但是一個天眞未鑿的孩子，就他被指示一項而言：已夠便我們憐憫了！</p>
<p>經過××路的中段，在一個紥起竹籬笆預備興建電影院和跳舞塲的塲合。在外面釘起一塊馬口鐵皮的廣告牌，「心的安慰，性的安慰。」他是這樣皇皇然的告訴我們。怪不得現在的電影，是没有什麽敎育意味，而專求香艷肉感的。跳舞塲也不包含什麽交際和娛樂，而專求性的發洩。我終至於蒞然若失，或許這是一幅模糊的都市的縮影吧。</p>

<p>在妻子跟前，不查常是　着臉，過甚其詞的談着伙人　　的困難。</p>
<p>在妻子跟前，不要視伊爲專和你生育小孩的妻子，應當視爲調濟你生活的情人。在妻子跟前，不要把夫婦的生活弄得太平淡，應當使生活愈有曲折愈好。</p>

<p>— 胡小米</p>
<p>午後，天上響着輕輕的雷。天氣史顯得沉悶了。　　鳥雲由四處很快的蓋攏來，厚厚的，低低的，一會兒便　將炙人的陽光遮没。天顯得非常的可怕，黑鬱鬱地似乎要坍歷到頭上來。</p>
<p>人渾身感到格外的煩燥，胸口好像承擔着一件千萬斤重的東西，壓得令人透不過氣來。</p>
<p>雷聲在密雲中往來不住的轟響着，電光時時的閃出雲外來。樹梢頭聽不見蟬的呌聲，只有一大羣蜻蜓，在庭前的半空中往來的飛舞。</p>
<p>空然，霹靂一聲，天空似乎炸裂了；比黄豆大的雨點，如亂箭般的射下來；落在被陽光炙熱的地上，都化作水氣上騰。</p>
<p>急雨如亂箭般的射着，耳中充滿了澎湃的聲浪；雷聲更響亮地在雲中滾動，電光在雲間不住來往穿插的閃燦。</p>
<p>一個老農夫含着烟管望着天微笑的說：「這一陳雨，今年的秋收大約有望了「」</p>
<p>鳥雲慢慢地散開，雨尖也漸漸地止住；知了在樹梢頭聲聲地呌，太陽光重新由雲間穿射到地上來。澎湃的音聽不見丁，耳邊顯得過分的淸靜。</p>
<p>雨後吹來了幾障凉風，渾身感到格外我曾經愛上一個姑娘，</p>
<p>那姑娘穿着天一般藍的衣裳，</p>
<p>那姑娘的眸子像秋夜的星一樣，</p>
<p>那姑娘的靈魂，聖潔如一輪滿滿的月亮。—那姑娘呢？—伊發着酸溜溜的調　予子問，—不要惱！奸姑娘就是你啊！—</p>
<p>—　—肋帮兒飛上紅雲來啦，把腦袋埋在我的懷　，呵呵地笑着說：</p>
<p>—可愛的孩子哪！頑皮的，頑皮的。！</p>
<p>吻着伊的紅嘴唇，嚼鮮菓似的滋味！—好甜啊！</p>
<p>幾隻小艇，像飛燕掠水般游過去了，船上人也是那麽愉快　吹着口哨唱着夜曲。</p>
<p>夏，愉快的季節呵！在　娃栗妲村的河上，我這朶乾枯了的十九年的心花，又灌注了甘露，蓬勃地怒放啦！</p>

<p>中行　　孔祥熙氏演說、略謂諸位出洋之目的是爲求　、是爲求外國之學問、但求學必須求實用之學問、才算　到目的、外國學問有好有壞、我們固廳學其好的方面、但好的學問中不一定全是實用、我們應擇其切於實用的學來、才能有補於我國、才爲不虚出洋求學之目的、同時諸位在外國、要做實在的中國人、中國有中國的地理歷史文化、我們　　時表示自已是中國人、不受外國的洋化、才能爲祖國爭光、今日我們舉行歡送會、將來諸位學成歸國、我們再舉行盛大的歡迎會、其意義更比今日重大云、</p>

<p>市商會主席王曉籟演說、略謂今天兄弟同時接到二個地方的帖子、一個是德國據龍號軍艦招待、一個是此間、但在我私人考量之下、覺得歡送留學生比參觀據龍號來得重要、蓋諸位二百餘留學生出國、等於二百餘隻據龍號巡洋出國云、</p>

<p>前淸華大學校長曹雲祥演說、略謂中國第一個留學生是容　、在一八五四年出國、距今已八十餘年、當時並無一人歡送、目前一般人都說留學生不能做事、其實中國第一個留學生容閎已做了一翻大事業、如招商局電報局等、都是容先生之事業、其次首批出洋者爲四人、其中二人一爲宋　齡女士、一爲宋美齡女士、此二位留學生也總算偉人了、尙有陳錦濤先生也是這批出國的、而陳先生留學歸來成功一經濟學家、他曾說做經濟論文是很容易、但欲靠論文以解决中國之大問　則不可能、是可　明實中國問題之大、而非留學生之失敗、我國第一個留學生容閎說中國問題之解决、須爲民知覺、所以希望諸君將來也要爲民知覺、爲民造福、把第一個留學生之精神繼續下去云、</p>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>焦先生說：「我們第三者用客觀的眼光看起來，西醫有長處，也有短處，國醫有短處，也有長處。」焦先生做了國醫館的長，忽然要站在第三者地位講話，說是客觀的眼光，恐怕不對罷—我以爲天地事物，没有一件是完全有害，完全無益的。俗語說；「有一利必有一弊，」譬如毒藥可以除病，甘草可以和中，狗矢雀糞可以柔革，甚而至於病源微生物，也可以利用他來醫除惡疾，神經系統中一種變形梅毒，呌做「麻痺狂」，現在曉得可用瘧疾原蟲來治療他，所以一方面以爲有害無用的事物，從别一方面觀察起來，到是有益的，不過利害兩個作用，不能同時並立，利有大小，害亦有大小，這種地方要用着選擇的工夫了。古人說得好，（「利取其重，害取其輕，」又說道，「雖小道，必有可觀者矣，致遠恐泥，是以君子不爲也。」所以做人的道理，要曉得有分别，識得大小輕重，然後有取舍决擇的能力，方才可以向着目標進行，不至於開倒車。否則，聽了兩方面的訴辭，各有各是下不了一句判斷，弄行旁皇歧路，一進一退，成了「疑事無功，歧行不至」的悲慘結果，這種人，就呌做庸人，做了醫生，就呌做庸醫；做了官，在君子時代，呌做庸臣，現在只好呌做庸官了，庸人擾事，庸醫殺人，庸官誤國！</p>
<p>焦先生說：「西醫的長處：在於物質文明進步，有優良的器械運用，診察精確，消毒嚴密。」西醫的長處，固然止這幾種，然而這幾種的長處，是焦先生所承認的了，并且可以反證得「國醫是物質文明不進步，無優良的器械運用，診察不精確，消毒不嚴密，」國醫這幾件短處，當然焦先生也不能不承認的了。我以爲這幾種長短處，就可以判定醫學的命運，巳經是非同小可。焦先生！國人！請用冷靜的頭腦，公平的心氣，聽我道來。第一件物質文明：醫學的對象，是人的身體，人是自然界中的一種物，牠的視聽，言動，知覺，思想，感情和種種生活現象，都有一定的裝置，一定的規律，醫生最低限度，也應該曉得人體構造和生理規律，然後可以進一步探究病變的情僞，確定治療的方針。若是這一點基本智識還没有具備，要想整理衆說，研求高深，距離是未免差得太遠了。這班學無根底的醫生，請問怎樣能夠眞實地醫治疾病呢？所以謹遵着焦先生「從學理上探討」的命令論起來，國醫所宣傳的醫好某某疾病等話，除了大部分屬於誇大宣傳之外，其餘所有的實在情形，都是逃不出章潢圖書徧所說的「幸中偶合」四字範圍之内。古語說，「皮之不存，毛將焉附，」還有什麽學理方術可講呢？一切都是虚僞啦！</p>
<p>第二件器械運用：簡單的說幾句，有了顯微鏡，方才能發明微生物。有了麻醉藥，方才開腹術進步，可以目騐生活的臟腑。有了愛克司光線，方才能確</p>
<p>實診斷内部幾種毛病，治療幾種惡性頑固的腫瘤和皮膚病。器械的優良，對於整個醫學的進步上，是有莫大的關係。焦先生應該記得「工欲善其事，必先利其器」的兩句格言，也應該記得我國古來對於醫生呌做「工」，所惟有上工下工的名詞，若是器械不精良，做醫工的當然不能善其事了，所以國醫的不能善其事，是無可掩諱的事實。換一句說，就是國醫方術的不好，是不可逃避的因果律，是不可搖動的定說了。</p>
<p>第三件診察精確：醫生治病，當然應該診察精確，方才可以對準疾病用藥，國醫診察不精確，焦先生已經反證不諱了。但這件事在醫學上，是學理和實用的大關鍵，不單單對於生病的個人有影響，診察精確，能夠認識疾病正身，然後可以運用學理來對付他，若是認錯了疾病正身，張冠李戴，那末关之毫釐，就要失之千里了。譬如錯認中風是痰，拼命用除痰藥去治療，假若幸而好了，在不懂學理的人們，就說這病確實是痰，認眞確實，用藥對準，所以有應如桴鼓的好成績。其實，從學理上探討起來，中風當然不是痰，是個腦溢血，用治痰的方法去醫腦溢血，當然是文不對題，用痰藥去治腦溢血，當然是藥不對病，并且他們所謂除痰的藥，是否眞是除痰，也是絲毫没有根據。總而言之，全盤都是向壁虚造的瞎話，把中風硬說是痰，把治療的方法硬說是治痰，把所用的藥硬說是痰藥，疾病輕瘥起來的時候，就硬說是他們方術就是了。我記得漢朝的路温舒做一篇上德緩刑書，内中最痛切的一段說道：「夫人情安則樂生。，痛則思死，捶楚之下，保求而不得。故囚人不勝痛，則飾辭以視之，吏治者利其然，則指導以明之，上奏畏却，則鍜鍊而周之，蓋奏當之成，雖咎繇聽之，猶以爲死有餘辜，何則，成練者衆，文致之罪明也。」國醫的鍜鍊疾病，文致治法，何嘗不是這樣，所以山經引相塜書說道：「山川而能語，葬師食無所。肺腑而能語，醫師色如土。」國醫們依賴着肺腑不能語的背景，硬把脈因症治四事，穿鑿附會，打成一片，來流傳謬種，欺瞞民衆，弄行上下古今，承謬習非，不但没有認識疾病正身的理法，并這種思想也没有了。於是乎因了不能認識疾病正身的緣故，就把治療方術的對不對，合理不合理，也不能判斷了。藥的功用究竟在那裹，也無從考覈了。弄得全盤都成彊局，四大皆空，毫無一點切實下手工夫，所以我國醫學永遠不會進步。這是診察不精確對於醫學自身發達上所成就的惡果。（未完）</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>第五章醫藥之行政</p>
<p>第三節近年之政令</p>
<p>對於外藥商。雖然也經衛部令他們將出品登記。而至今奉令守法的。能有若干。一般外國劣藥。還不是自由銷售。甚而至於高麗人。入中國籍。掛美商牌號。賣德國藥。又有什麽辦法呢？麻醉品的管理條例。雖在修改。也不能行之順利。海關只管當作違禁品搜查。而藥房凡自將此等貨品應市。這中間。無非没有澈底想一辦法。所以似乎可笑。（至於天津衛生局。因爲取締所謂「白麫」的毒物。而連帶禁止乳糖販賣。—說是乳糖爲製造白麫的必需品。這種削足適履的政令。未免更可笑了。）</p>
<p>以上所述的政令。大槪都是全國的事。而上海市感受到種種影響最深。至於十七年的冬天。正是衛生部猶未成立。而各地衛生局或公安局。各自爲政的時代。上海市醫師公會。曾經呈請當局。在醫師法未頒布以前暫緩登記一。然而一時無從補救。各地已紛紛進行。上海因租界關係。尤其七零八落。登記毫不普編。不久由衛生部取消各地登記的效力。一律改爲部登記。也未必個個都領部照。凡自做他的華僑式醫師。直到十九年十二月和二十年五月。先後受法租界和公共租界的取締。方始去領租界執照。然而令不一貫。當然又演出不合部頒條例。而領得租界執照的流弊來。並且租界雖有取締的章程。而究難實行取締的手續。幾曾見租界警察。干涉醫者的業務呢。所以在十八年上。部令一律領取部照的時候。曾有人呈請衛生局。取締無照醫師。結果亦只得到函復照辦的紙上空談。而去年又有人要請租界當局。取締那些無照雜醫。大言惑衆。租界當局。竟回說中國法律上没有規定。「那一個許醫病？那一個不許醫病？」法院旣不便裁制。警權如何執行呢。照此看來。當時行政院拘拘於醫師資格之嚴。也不過粉飾貴族用品的主張。對於民衆的醫藥觀念很薄了。</p>
<p>上海市衛生局。在十七年冬。還有一條「中醫不得用西藥西醫不得用中藥」的政令。硬將醫藥併爲一談。而拿學理丢在腦後。在衛局或者爲防制業務之爭的聰明辦法。（按中央當局。頗有人指新醫駁斥舊醫。舊醫痛詆新醫。爲業務之爭。然我新醫。終未承認）。自以爲陳平宰肉。公正熨貼之至。或者是防制舊醫亂用血淸等品的消極政策。也未可知。然而此令公布。倒反引起新醫界的非難。而舊醫中欲標新者的惡感。還有一項政令。乃是衛生局受了黨部的建議。要限制市内開業醫的診金。實在開業醫的診金。暗暗受着社會上自然的裁判。如果價高技劣。必歸淘汰。至於貧病。就是五角至一元的診金。也照樣不能担負。公家不辦醫院。而强令個人送診。如何能成一句話。所以此令也是令出不行。</p>
<p>最近上海市醫師公會。自動徵求得五十餘位會員。每日分區送診一小時。印有診劵。可以向會中索取。也算公會對社會一些小小義務。綜括已往的醫藥政令。忽嚴忽寬。或能行不行。或不能行而强行嘗試。手忙脚亂。無非由於（甲）一部份的衛生當局。認定了純歐美化的理想高標準。（乙）少數中央委員。以個人情感。以信仰個人。偏護舊醫。（丙）受黨部或商會等團體之策動。（丁）受租界外人之掣肘。—種種原因所造成。而此種嘗試政令一再更易的過程中。自然有不少的間隙可乘。於是在這百業不興。民生凋敝的當兒。就有大批投機分子。混入醫藥界來。這就是汪企張所說「非分之想。僥倖之得」了。猶憶本文第二章發表的時候。曾說西醫公會是法令迫出来的。並說該會没有限制。自易欄入雜色份子。—頗引起西醫公會的憤懣。如今我把事實線索。申說明白。大槪西醫公會。也可以知道此種現象。確乎妨碍新醫的大體。（此係西醫公會某會員語我。）而不致於誤會我有什麽過意汚蔑之心罷。（本章完）</p>
<h3 id="c217">新醫藥發達過程中幾個重要的發現和發明（七） <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>（五）臟器療法和分泌學說</p>
<p>人類在古代已相信體内的一定臟器具有一定作用。這種信念並不限於原始民族，就是古代以及現代的開化民族，也未嘗没有，因爲相信勇敢和心臟有關，所以野蠻民族的武士就以爲喫敵人的心臟可以增加勇氣。由這種心理，就很容易推想到喫動物的肝臟對於人的肝病所以有效。我們在色爾少士（Ｂｅｌｓｕｓ）和地阿士司利德士（Ｄｉｏｓｅｏｒｄｅｓ）的著作物中所以發見他們主張用種種動物的臟器醫治人類的這些臟器的疾病，例如因爲狐能用高速度走遠距離，所以認爲狐的肺臟對於呼吸短促可以有效，同樣地，以爲兎腦可治震顫，犢胃可治胃病。這種辦法，一直繼續到比較的近代：但是在十九世紀的初葉，這些藥物幾乎都不爲藥典所收錄，後來我們關於胃的生理的知識進步以後，就居然能由猪胃中提出胃液素，製成人工胃液，應用於消化不良症了。</p>
<p>同樣的製劑由胰腺也曾製造出來，這胰液對於幾種的不消化狀態也用得很廣，甚至用以先行消化食餌的也有。這種胰液普通是由猪的胰腺中所取出的。食餌受了胰液的作用，一部分已被消化，所以有胃病的人喫了這種已用胰液處置過的食餌，他們的消化器便不致負担太重，通常乳汁也可如此處置。詳說起來，就是：在一定量的乳汁中加些人工胰液，將這混和液保存於和體温同等的温度中，經若干時，使胰液中的酵素對於乳汁的成分作用起來，和乳汁在人體内受了胰液的作用一樣，然後將其作爲飲料。這種方法確有價値，但是也有限度。普通不可豫行消化太久，否則這種食餌或將不免失去美味，不足以供食用。　　上述應用胃液和胰液的原理比較的簡單。此外我們關於應用臟器醫治疾病方面，還有更複雜的方法，特别稱爲臟器療法。</p>
<p>體内多數腺性臟器的分泌物大槪都由導注入體腔，以營種種，有益的作用。例如唾腺所分泌的垂液常在口腔内補助食餌的消化，就是一例。</p>
<p>可是有些腺性臟器的分泌物並不由導管注入體腔，郤是由淋巴管或血管直接通入循環系内周流全身，營種種的特殊作用。這種分泌作用持别稱爲内分泌，在近代醫學上很上重要，據近年研究的結果，知道有些疾病是由一定的内分泌臟器的缺損或變化而起的，最初發見的内分泌臟器便是頸部前面的盾狀腺。</p>
<h3 id="c218">診餘隨筆 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>緒言代序</p>
<p>我業醫，診病是我的天職，本應專心致志，盡我的職務罷了，何必信口嘵舌，來寫這個隨筆呢。但是看官須知道，我們處在過渡時代的中國，凡百社會現象，都在矛盾變態之中，醫事也難逃出這個通例。要知道在外國社會裹行醫，醫師只要盡心竭力，以銳眼慧心，診斷病象：以博聞多識，應用醫規；就能不失其職了。而在中國社會裹行醫，醫事的矛盾變態，幾乎無日不相逢。我們逢着這個矛盾變態，有時胸口中發出抑塞磊落的奇氣，不能不有所舒泄。有時眼珠上影着無限的憐憫與悲哀，不能不有所勸告，有時且鼻子裹忍着噴飯的滑稽，更不能不拿一枝秃筆來玩玩，以蘇散我業務的疲勞，這就是診餘隨筆的來由。</p>
<p>上海灘上，夷塲地界。畢竟是國際合作的策源地。二三年前，與幾個朋友，到吳淞去吸吸海邊新空氣，聽見兩個人，在一所大房子面前。指手劃脚的說：「這個稀奇的地方，算什麽呢，一方面掛着中國國立醫學院的牌子，一方面掛着煤油大王的招牌。」「那算什麽呢，中華民國的政府，在中華民國國内，辦中華民國國立的大學，要靠外國人來捐助一塊地，做做校基，這種矛盾的事實，你了解麽？」「我了解了，因爲要中國的子弟，去學世界大同的醫學，當然先要他們學學國際合作的榜樣。」我現在看看日本人，在東三省地方，掛了滿洲國牌子，要滿韃子做木人，自已站在後面牽綫，原來是猜透我們貴國人的國際合作與世界大同的精神。牠說我辦南滿醫學堂，是敎育中國子弟的，我辦大連醫員，是救護中國苦力的，國際合作萬歲！世界大同萬歲！有一次，在朋友家裹，聽見一位王君說：「有一位家藏五六十萬貫的員外，他患輕度中風，右手右足，舉動不良，請某療養院的外國醫生看，說是血壓過高，應該放血，講定放血費五百兩以後，就請其實行，不料放血太多，始而面白，繼而筋搐，終而氣絶，這位外國大夫，還要說出門的風凉話，他說：「不要緊，不要緊，把他放子泥土上，兩晝夜不給東西吃，會好的。一氏驚奇的向王君問：「究竟放了多少血呢？」他說：「大約有三四磅。」我說：「應該死的，一個人所含的血量，約當體重十二三分之一，急性失血至五分之一以上，就有生命危險，假定這位員外體重百二三十斤，其血量約十斤，放三四磅，豈不要命麽！」我又問他放血費如何呢？他說五百兩照付的，元來住在夷塲地界的中國人，就是傷命，也當唯唯納傷命費於洋人，我們常常聽見某外國醫院的盲腸炎割症費一千兩，照Ｘ光費七百兩，照雷錠費二千兩，又常常聽見出錢的人們說，洋人醫院眞不差，煞淸爽，應該貴的。又常常聽見人們說，現在的醫藥費眞貴，冬霜葉，夏楛草，一帖就是四角，趙醫生，錢醫生，</p>
<p>一看就是二元，這種話兩兩對照，</p>
<p>須知道有世界大同根性的人們，住到夷塲地界裹，其信仰外貨是應該的，何足爲奇！（未完）</p>

<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>據說紅樓夢的績集，有七八種之多，而令人看得入眼的，一種也没有。古語有狗尾續貂之嘆，確乎使人慨感系之。</p>
<p>續是不容易作的，一部作品倘是完成的作品，一定已經自成了一個世界，有牠獨特的完整的體系，要做續集，須先明白原作品裹那世界中的一切，並且看出其必然要產生的發展與動向，然後依據這而展開新局面方可。這樣，續集與本集方能連貫一氣，而成其爲眞正的續，不知是而亂寫一陣，便是胡鬧。</p>
<p>所以續是很不空易寫的，至少不比新闢蹊徑的獨創容易，但不知道此種難處而寫續篇的人却很多，每一部小出名可以圖利的作品，總有不止一個人做的續集。他們不是寫續集，而是假借名義以牟利，他們的目的只在借用已出了名的書名，以便容易號召，可以賺錢，這一種續集，應該打倒的。</p>
<p>也有眞正做續集的人，或續其友人未完成之作，或因爲讀了一本作品而大有感觸，覺得非傾吐不可的，但做得好的人，仍非常之少。因爲續之前，已經有了個旣定而完成的世界，一切都要從那裹出發，决不是同寫章回小說那麽一回一回續下去即可，所以用接寫一回章回小說的態度去做續集，一定失敗的。因之一回一回作章回小說看是很好的作品，比方内容豐富，事態多波瀾曲折，詞藻美麗，文章的確動人，牠自身是成爲一本好作品了，但倘若這是續某書而不是創始時，則作爲續看，好不好却並不了，因爲續還有另外的主要之點，如上所說述者。</p>
<p>做小說是續集難寫，即使寫得不好，我們總可以原諒的，但那些不作爲續集看是很巧妙，作爲續集看便不成個樣子的，眞令人有點哭笑不得的。</p>

<p>文雅書生中也眞有物别善於下涙的人物，說是因爲近幾年中國文壇的混亂，好像軍閥割據，便不禁「嗚呼」起來了，但尤其痛心誣陷。</p>
<p>其實是作文「藏之名山」的時代一去，而有一個「壇一·便不免有鬥爭，甚而至於謾駡，誣陷的。明末太遠，不必提了；淸朝的章實齊和袁子才，李蒓客和趙撝叔，就如水火之不可調和；再近些，則「民報」和「新民叢報」之爭，「新靑年」派和某某派之爭，也都非常猛烈。當初又何嘗不使局外人搖頭歎氣，然而勝負一明，時代漸遠，戰血爲雨露洗得乾乾凈凈，後人便　以爲先前的文壇是太平了。在外國也一樣，我們現在大抵只知道囂俄和霍普德曼是卓卓的文人，但他們當時作品開演的時候，就在戲場裹捉人，打架，較詳的文學史上，還載着打架之類的圖。</p>
<p>所以，無論中外古今，文壇上是總歸混亂，使文雅書生看得要「悲觀」的。但也總歸有許多所謂文人和文章也者一定滅亡，只有配存在者終於存在，以證明文壇也總歸還是乾凈的處所。增加混亂的倒是有些悲觀論者，不施考察，不加批判，但用「彼亦一是非，此亦一是非」的論調，將一切作者，詆爲「一丘之貉」。這樣子，混亂是永遠不會收場的。然而世間却並不都這樣，一定會有明明白白的是非之别。我們試想一想，林琴南攻擊文學革命的小說，爲時並不久，現在那裹去了？</p>
<p>只有近來的誣陷，倒像是頗爲出色的花樣，但其實也並不比古時候更厲害，證據是淸初大興文字之獄的遺聞。况且鬧這樣玩意的，其實並不完全是文人，十中之九，乃是掛了招牌，而無貨色，只好化爲黑店，出賣人肉饅頭的小盜；即使其中偶有曾經弄過律墨的人，然而這時却正是露出原形，在告白他自已的没落，文壇决不至因此混亂，倒是反而越加淸楚，越加分明起來了。</p>
<p>歷史决不倒退，文壇是無須悲觀的。悲觀的由來，是在置身事外，不辨是非，而偏要關心於文壇，或者竟是自已坐在没落的營盤裹。</p>

<p>前作孔乙已，列入　廬絮語。謂此描紅語訣，在唐宋前即有之。頃得若璋先生自其所著屏俗討源鈔寄「上大人」一條，益足證予前說之不謬矣。撮要如次：梁章鉅浪跡續談引傳燈錄云，或問陳尊宿，如何是一代時敎。陳曰，上大人，丘乙已。五燈會元載郭功甫謁白雲，雲曰，夜來枕上作箇山頌謝功甫大儒，乃上大人，丘乙已，化三千，七十士。爾小生，八九子，佳作仁，可知禮也。公初疑，後聞小兒誦之，乃有省。据此則唐宋時已有此語矣。祝枝山猥談解其義云，此孔子上其父書也。上大人爲一句。孔爲一句，乃孔子自稱也。一已化三千七十士爾爲一句，言一身所化士有如此數也。小生八九子佳爲一句，蓋八九乃七十二，言三千人中七十二人更佳也。作仁可知禮又爲一句，作猶爲，仁與禮相爲用，七十字善爲仁，其於禮可知也。　　唐宋塾師之生活未知何似，然自此一訓蒙之描紅語訣視之，其學藴儉陋可知，似與魯迅先生所描寫之孔乙已相去不遠也。吾鄉農民扮演之俗劇有張糊塗一種，一題張先生討學錢，此亦描寫舊時代之蹩脚文人者，張糊塗蓋亦孔乙已之流也。張糊塗自述其　師生活云：</p>
<p>在上辭别孔夫子，兩旁又辭衆賢人。爲人敎書眞難事，最不値錢臭斯人。敎書說難眞正難，藍衣坐白背坐灣。一直敎到十月滿，好的學東把錢還。壞的學東反胡說，先生帶著學生頑。讀完四書與五經，滿腹文章記在心。雖然不是讀書種，也在拿書敎學生。正月裹，是新春，家家户户去接燈。學東接我觀燈去，又怕玷辱我斯文。二月裹，是花朝，學東接我把館敎。他問學錢要多少，我說一百也不多，八十也不少，升半大米我也要。</p>
<p>三月裹，是淸明，家家户户上祖墳。學生接我去踏靑，南瓜炖肉待先生。四月裹，四月半，學東接我去吃飯。酒肉魚蝦吃一餐，還送幾隻鹽鴨蛋。五月裹，是端陽，敎書先生回了鄉。個個學東送節茶，送我幾條老黄瓜。六月裹，是伏天，敎書敎得汗湕漣。學錢只有六十文，倒要先生敎一年。七月裹，七月七，敎書只有一枝筆。五經四書我不知，三字經上我第一。八月裹，是中秋，敎書先生到了頭。學東個個把節拜，每人帶塊月餅來。此劇即借糊塗先生之口，寫出塾師之假斯文·寒酸相，苦生活。曲旣詼諧有趣，亦於若輩村夫子予以不少之同情。蓋塾師與農民接近，故在農民劇中猶非十分敵視之人物。當國民革命軍初起時，各地農民恊會類皆有小學敎師參加，亦以小學敎師與農民最爲接近，同屬被支配階級，其在經濟地位上亦略相當也。張糊塗孔乙已一流之塾師時代早已過去，今之小學敎師當知所以自勉矣。</p>

<p>— 依雲</p>
<p>做了一年多的小學敎師，說是對於兒童敎育有什麽心得，可眞也不敢。不，一想起兒童，想起這許多比較純潔的人來，我還未免負疚良深。在現在，什麽都商品化了的現在，進不了學校的孩子不說牠，就是那些僥倖能進學校的孩子們，也是可憐地的受着那不足爲外人道的敎育。日前看見有幾位先生在討論敎科書的編制問題，但死的敎科書是須要活的人來敎授的，實際能陶冶兒童的性情，增進兒童的學識的却還是小學敎師。怎樣能夠使得兒童自動地去研究，旁牽類證地利用書本以發揮其理解性，這完全在乎敎師的能否與兒童相合爲一。爲敎師的應將全心志都放在兒童身上，要具有一顆天眞的童心，一副明敏的頭腦，使　子能在不自覺中愉快地跟着你跑。愛的敎育在小學中是十分十分地　　的。　然，在現在底新學校中已没有所謂夏楚之刑了，但看見了先生立刻變得呆木了的情形却還是到處皆是，這原因當然是在乎爲先生的太先生樣了，一動便罰寫字站壁角，使孩子不得不一見悚然。然而小學敎師之所以如此，也正有其苦衷在。說到小學敎師的生活，其冗忙，其淸苦，差不多是人人皆知。五月一期的聘約，巳足使她們或他們在每學期的終結擔一次憂，而平日底按鐘點的計薪更使他們戰戰兢兢地不敢或時而缺，即使是病了也都挨着上課，否則一月中星期日除外，再來上幾天病假，就只好留着肚子喝風了。在被逼出賣着時間與勞力的小學敎師們，因此便不得不慳吝着那些没有被賣的時間以補生活上的不足，於是孩子們被敷衍了，除了書本上的正課外，他們不能再在敎師那裹多得一些什麽，因爲敎師們多費了的精力與時間，在他們都是没有代價的，他們不能餓了肚子來談敎育，他們更不能讓自已的孩子飯也没得吃去敎育别人的孩子；而爲了一學期終必須敎完那些課本的關係，他們又不能不像索債者似的向孩子們緊壓，於是卑怯的取巧的性情都在孩子間養成了，「上下交相敷衍」，便成了今日的敎育狀况。爲人類計，我們决不能讓我們的孩子繼續去受那些不知所云的敎育的，但要有好的敎育就要有好的敎師，要有好的敎師，就必須先使他們生活上有些保障。但在現社會的制度下，不須顧慮到生活而能專心致志地從事於某一事業的，會有麽？</p>

<p>「没有談，因爲大家本都不曉得要尋老老板。後來春山跑到廠裹聽見了情形，深悔當初没有問個仔細，所以我們又派了些人到重慶路一帶去尋，一面特地來報信。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，老邱。」伯唐說，接著又像對自已詢問似地：「重慶路又有了新花樣嗎！」</p>
<p>他這時候抬頭望者大衆了，但是誰也不能肯定；他繼續又說：</p>
<p>「有了地方，至少是爺老爺還没有到那裹去······不過，這又是點把鐘以前的事，現在還得趕緊再想法子·····」</p>
<p>這叚話還没有說定，一個僕人拿了一張名片來，說是有客定要進來會面，伯唐縐起眉頭接了那名片一看，瞧見上面那兩行小字之中的三個大字「是壽子春··」</p>
<p>「這位朋友眞像是故意趕在百忙裹面和我開心······旣然來了就讓他進來罷！」</p>
<p>僕人出去之後，佩　已經在名片上面看見　子春的住址是重慶路××里××號和電話是××號了，連忙就向伯唐說：</p>
<p>「這個人住在重慶路　倘若他也是給我們報信的，那就再便當没有了！」</p>
<p>「那裹有這樣的事！」伯唐說，「你總是一天到晚住在空中樓閣裹面的·····」</p>
<p>他正想再說下去，大家已經看見那個僕人引了一個五短身材的西裝矮胖子進來，那副臉是紅紅的，團團的，平平的，戴着一副略帶　圓的黑邊眼鏡，越發使得他那圓圓的眼睛肥肥的鼻子，格外和他全身的風度調和。他瞧見食堂裹面很有幾個人，就先普遍地招呼了一週，然後才和伯唐寒喧並且道及來意：</p>
<p>「今天晚飯，務必請賞光。」</p>
<p>「老兄這樣費事，實在是不敢當。」</p>
<p>「務必請到舍下一坐。」</p>
<p>「眞不敢當，先頭接到電話，本應當立刻就回老兄，現在老兄親自來邀，眞是萬分抱歉······」「大家都是很熟的人，伯唐兄，何必這樣說！剛才打了十多次的電話始終接不通，所以才親自來一躺。」</p>
<p>「論道理，子春兄，我眞應當遵命，不過偏偏今天舍下有點家務事，緊要的家務事，所以眞不能分身，寵召只得心領。」</p>

<p>近數月來，復興農村，朝野重視。號稱以農立國及農民占人口總額八五％以上，而農村竟逐年衰落，日卽於崩潰，此誠國計民生之大患也。諸家著論立說，溯其原因，策其將來，不下二十餘種。但經濟問題之藴藏，如埃及之金字塔然。其最低層之數量愈多，而其最高層之重心，必愈單純，且必愈尖銳。農村問題雖不妨爲細别的分柝，而提綱挈領，要亦有其綜合之原因。欲爲綜合之觀察，必先以左之前提。　　現代經濟，或稱世界交通經濟。貨物與金融之流通，幾無國界之可分。故物價之上落，與利率之高低，全世界每呈同樣之趨勢。所謂經濟之自由競爭者是也。故貨物之生產成本，雖有差異，而物價之上落，必歸於平衡，非一市一業所能久長壟斷。此種情形，以小生產事業之產物爲最顯。產物之售價，幾全爲市塲所支配。單獨之成本幾何，不足論也。若事業之規模大，產物之出數鉅。對於市塲之供求，旣握有相當之支配力。於物價之上落，比較的亦握有自主權。專利之事業，托拉斯之組織，以及蘇俄之國營貿易，均其好例也。此觀察生產事業者所應明之前提一也。</p>
<p>生產事業，一經濟事業也。經濟之原則曰，以最小之勞費，獲最大之效果。生產事業亦然。故勞費務求其小，而售價務求其高。且惟勞費小，則成本輕，成本輕，則售價不妨低於市塲價格。故售價雖减低，而其事業仍能日趨繁榮。反之，成本較一般同業爲高，而產物之售價，要不能不受市價之支配。則平時之僅敷開支者，同業已獲利矣；跌價時業尙能扯本者，而已則不免蝕本矣。事業利潤，旣步步落後，衰落崩潰，自屬難免。凡生產事業之興替，蓋皆作如此觀。此觀察生產事業者所應明之前提二也。</p>
<p>產物成本，有直接間接之别。而其分攤於產物之成數，大量生產者，必較小量生產者爲低。間接成本爲尤甚焉；如管理費用；如推銷費用等，產量愈巨，其分攤率愈節約。卽推而至於直接成本，大量之使用，亦較小量爲節約。且茲之所謂節約，不特使用時之質量已也。</p>
<p>各種成本上所需物質之進價勞力之工資及銀根之利息等，大規模之事業，亦較小規模者爲節約。托拉斯·卡鐵沉等之事業組織，其產物成本之較低，胥以此耳。此觀察生產事業者所應明之前提三也。</p>
<p>物之生產，有手工制與機器制之别。手工制者，處處須用人力，而人工則必須相當之生活費，生產力雖較小，而人工所費，不能過低，過低則不足維持其生活，而人將相率棄此工作耳。機器制者，可以節省人力，往往以二三人管理一機器，而生產力足抵數十人至數百人。故其生產雖較大，而開支之分攤於生產者，其比例反較小。夫人工開支，本爲產物成本之主要部份，機器生產，旣能節約人工，其成本自較手工制爲低。此觀察生產事業者所應明之前提四也。</p>
<p>就上之四前提以爲觀察，可知生產事業當此世界經濟潮流中，惟大量的生產，與機器的生產，始足以圖存。其生產之規模愈大，機器之使用愈廣者，則成本愈節約，經濟的原則愈適用。近言之，事業家可於市塲占優勢，遠言之，則社會民生，當不難普受其惠。大學有云，「生之者衆」，合於經濟原則之生產方法者也。</p>
<p>○○○○○</p>
<p>吾國之農村，固農產物之生產事業也。在此世界交通經濟中，旣不能閉關自守，自不能不與世界各國之農業，同受經濟原則所支配。今且覘其所受之支配，較世界之一般農業者爲何如？</p>
<p>大量生產制，爲工業革命以來一般生產組織之特色，工業無論矣，卽如儂業，亦且有此傾向。美國之大規模耕作，人人所知也。蘇俄自一九二九年後集產化之政策，厲行於農業。故其蠈產物之矿額，最有長足之進步。我國則雖有大地主，而佃多少作農。耕地在十畝以下者，幾占農民全數之半。此以生產組織之大小言，吾國農村，本屬落伍。</p>
<p>機器制之使用於生產事業，工業實居其首，次乃及於農業。英美及蘇俄等，皆其著者也，據英國之統計，最新式之機製鋼犂，每具每日可耕二十五英畝至四十英畝左右，以視人工，快慢誠不可以道里計也。我國農村，其耕作方法，素恃手工制。其間雖參用牲畜代耕，面工作之遲速，固不足以望機器制之項背。此以生產技術言，吾國農村，亦屬落伍。</p>
<p>就生產之組織及技術言，吾國農產物之生產勞費，蓋當較各國爲多。而其物價，則又不能不受世界市塲之支配。勞費大而收效小，經濟原則之所忌也。雖曰農民生活程度，低於各國。然必要之之生活費，當不能不求其維持，此種生活費亦成本之一部份，則成本必不能如利用機器者之低。吾國農業之不能與世界各國競爭，亦經濟之原則使然也。迨夫售價不敷成本，收入不敷開支，則農村之現金外流，農業之設備益陋。地價日益低，荒地日益增。蓋藏日益　，出產日益少，流民日益多，匪盜日益滋。舉凡農村誤落之種種現象，無不相因而生。近且不僅衰落，岌岌焉有崩潰之勢矣。而窮源究本，則蝕本而已矣。蝕本，固生產事業之所大忌也。</p>
<p>抑吾國農產物成本之高，其原因不僅生產組織及技術之失當而已。其間接成本之重，亦足以致之。如賦稅之特重，個租之剝削，及販</p>
<p>賣居間者之重重侵蝕等，無一不足以增重其成本，而减低其凈益。前者出於特别原因，後之二者則仍爲小生產組織所生之流弊。生產組織與生產技術之落伍，誠農村蝕本之大原因也。　　依照上述之論據，復興農村，應就農產事業之本身，施行二大方案：</p>
<p>（一）土地國有土地私有，則分配不均，豪强兼併。人口繁密之區，耕者不能得其地。人口較疏之域，地利不能盡其用。於大生產組織之推行，諸多妨害。且私有則地主安坐而食，佃户負擔佃租。前者於社會經濟上爲糜費，後者於農產物上爲增加間接成本。均足以阻礙民生之正當發展。故今當收爲國有。國家按照農民之現狀，量爲劃分，農民之耕地，不限於現在。西北等着之荒地，亦可利用也。農民之生產組織，不以每户爲單位。合數千百户，亦可共耕共存也。總之，土地當以社會爲戰位，使成爲活用的土地，並使成爲大量生產組織之土地，此土地國有之謂也</p>
<p>（二）機器利用機器之足以增加生產力，工業革命以來所共見也。農耕恃人畜之力，曠日久而勞費多，不合經濟原則，非大規模利用機器不可。機器當然亦有成本，其成本須分攤於農產物。然較之人畜之費，必屬節約，則可近證之於手工工業與機製工業者也。但農耕之用機器，耕地愈廣者，費愈節約。且非耕地廣而資力厚者，不足以廣用機器。故惟在大量生產組織下適用之。且更推而論之，大量生產組織，亦惟利用機器，乃可以節約成本，而發揮其大量生產之特色。則土地國有與機器利用，固有不可離之關係。此機器利用之謂也。</p>
<p>右之二法，苟能實行，則農業之蝕本，必可轉機。於復興農村，至少可奏效大半。且農業苟能改良，社會經濟，必可繁榮。則民安國泰，百廢可興。豈惟賦稅可輕，社會秩序可整。卽如天災，亦可設法預防也。復興農村問題之徒從事於枝枝節節之設計何爲哉？</p>
<p>抑猶有進者，大量生產制與機器生產制之可復興農村，不獨農產之本業已也。卽推而至於種種副業，亦莫不如是。如手工業，如牧畜業等，苟能準此規繩，以設法改良。成本旣可减輕，出產亦可進步。以生產事業之經濟原則言，大量生產制與機器生產制，雖亦有其流弊，究是利多害細，况舉世皆然，而我獨否，故非亟起推行，不足以挽亡也。</p>
<p>或曰，吾國農地面積，約十五萬五千八百萬畝，平均統扯，每人僅得五畝。苟行大量生產制如農地之不敷分配何？且農民已苦矣業，苟行機器生產制。以奪人工，如失業農民之增加何？答曰，此無庸慮也。按之經濟原則，生產之收獲，當求其多，而參加某項生產之工作者不必多也。勞費之投下，祗求其爲生產，而生產之事業，不必限於一端也。則爲今之計，但求利用可耕之面積，以最經濟之生產方法，從事於生產足矣。苟民有餘力，則其他之生產事業尙多。正可利用之，以發揮全民之生產能力。削足適屨何爲哉？</p>

<p>前次我們在世界經濟恐慌現階段中最嚴重的貨幣問題一文　，已經將世界貨幣問題對於世界經濟恐慌的　係約略地講過了。因爲有許多的經　學家　　爲物價低落，是百業不振的根本原因，要想恢復世界的繁榮，就必首先用人爲的方法提高物價；要提高物價，只有用人爲的方法貶落貨幣的價格；美國目前的經濟政策，便是這類經濟學家鼓吹的結果。那麽，姑無論美國幣價低　物價高漲的現象是否是暫時的　花，姑無論美國就此能否恢復一時的繁榮？但這個問題有討論的必要，却是毫無疑義的了。</p>
<p>記得倫敦會議開會的時候，牠的議事日程，包括下列的六個要點：</p>
<p>一·恢復金本位制；二·防止物價的低落；三·廢止一切管理匯兌的手段；四·消滅國際商業底特别的障碍　例如禁令及額定制等等；五·訂立减輕及穩定關稅的恊定；六·取得各國政府一致同意的行動，以保　生產的組織及各種重要出產底互相交換。</p>
<p>從貨幣紛亂的過去事實看來，很顯明的，第一點是上列六點的主題。我們已經說過，貨蹩價格的穩定，雖不是恢復各國資本與商品相互流通底惟一的條件，却是拖必要的一個條件。但是，倘若金本位不恢復的話，則管理匯兌手段的廢止，商業特别障碍的消滅以及關稅政</p>
<p>策的穩定等等，都是一些廢話。</p>
<p>倫敦會議的議事日程，似乎是很合乎時勢的需要。但是我們要注意的，這並不是倫敦會議的功績。在一年以前，倫敦會議的預備工作剛剛開始的時候　便已有許多的專門家一致認定這個貨幣問題應處於最首要的地位，因爲他們相信貨幣是一切繁榮的鎖錀呢。他們提議用一種整理貨幣的手段去結束經濟的恐慌。像這種掛一漏萬的是解，坐井觀天的主張，識者早已斥其謬妄，用不着我們再來曉舌。一年以前，貨幣問題本是處於次要的地位，不幸，自一九三三年開始以來，尤其是自美國金元貶價以來，這個問題便偶然間惹起世人特别的注意而被認爲最重要的問題了。倘若說倫敦會議的議案適合時勢需要的話，這並不是基於會議倡導人的高瞻遠識，毋寗說是偶然問一隻盲鷄有時也覓得一粒米啊！</p>
<p>倫敦會議預備委員會的專門家，他們第一個表示，就是注意議事日程當中的第二點，卽所謂防止物價低落的問題。同時，有些比較頭腦冷靜些的專門家，却奮力抗爭以阻止會議專以提高物價爲目的。因爲有一般人—這是很痛心的，然而是無可如何的事實—能讀又能寫，能計又能算，但講到關於政治經濟的話，他們便　很像我們的祖先，像那太信太陽圍繞地球的祖先，竟想像着物價高漲，便可以使世界繁榮。記得馬克斯在哲學的貧困（Ｍｉｓｅｒｅｄｅｌａｐｂｉｌｏｓｏｐｈｉｅ）裡說過這幾句話：「當那天氣晴明的時候，我們可以看見許多的人在效外散步，蒲魯東（Ｐｒｏｕｄｈｏｎ）先生要人們都去散步，以便能夠保證天氣的晴明。」眞的，不錯，這些專門家先生們，他們原來要人們都去散步，以恢復晴明的天氣呢！事之愚笨，孰有過於此者！我們已預先料到，一般提倡用人爲的方法提高物價的人們，一定會在倫敦會議盡力的活動，希望會議能夠决定這個辦法，以恢復世界的繁榮。然而我們對這類的人亮無差别的一律去判批，那也未見得公平；因爲這裡面有拜物敎者，也有隨風轉舵的機會主義者。其中有一些人對於物價問題的態度，却也比較的切合現實；他們以爲國際間一致同意，共同規定一切貨幣的貶價，也未見得就能夠復興世界的繁榮。我們現在且把那比較切實的竇萊西（Ｍ·ＦｒａｎｃｉｓＤｅｌａｉｓｉ）的新計劃來研究一下罷。</p>
<p>這個新計劃的主張，本早已爲大多數美國經濟學家所贊成，最近，更爲法蘭西的經濟學家竇萊西所擁護。他首先把他的主張在共和國雜誌（ＬａＲｅｐｕｂｌｉｑｕｅ）上發表。他的觀念和一般相信提高物價卽能恢復繁榮的遊方郎中們，是有关别的。我們依據他在共和國雜誌所發表的文章，將他的新計劃簡括說明於下：</p>
<p>一·消滅通貨的種種束縛；二·解放冰凍凝結的信用；三·一致轉變外債的情况，用一種比較軟弱的貨幣去支付；四·消滅匯兌的頓併政策；五·廢除商品的額定制，縱不能一槪廢除，至少也須部分的廢除，因爲這種額定制常是妨碍通貨的流出；倘若廢除之後，卽可减少妨害貨幣平衡的因數；六·提倡各國資本的互相流通，並使有借欵與投資於外國的可能。</p>
<p>竇萊西氏宣稱，他所提議的新計劃，固然不能確保可以解决經濟恐慌的一切的問題，但爲開路起見，則必須首先恢復資本的自由流通。然後，我們纔可以談到减低關稅和消滅商品流通底障碍的問題。竇萊西氏對於他的計劃曾經詳細地說明如次：</p>
<p>「目今有一個很難解决的原因存在，一般工商企業的債權人及國家債權人都要求比他們借出的更多，他們始終相信他們有這種神聖的權利，可以要求債務人履行票面上債欵總數的義務，但是以購買力去估計這些數目的價格，却遠遠地超過借欵數目的價格。這種債權人與債務人的糾葛，是起因於一九二九年物價低落以後；因爲從一九二九年起，全世界批發物價的指數平均約减低百分之三十六。這就是說，貨幣的購買力平均約增加了百分之五十五。减低貨幣的價格，並没有别的意義，只不過使貨幣回復到一九二九年的購買力，只不過使收受債欵的債權人底手中所有的數目，只能獲有他們借出數目底同樣購買力。倘若說，一個加利福尼亞州的採礦者，他在一九二九年的時候，用一盎斯的金子，能夠購買四基羅又八十四　商品，在今日他用同樣數量的金子，却可以購買七基羅又五十七的商品了！因此，世界上就發現所謂「黄金購買力的膨脹」了！黄金的價格，比四年以前昻貴多了。就是這個不合理的「膨脹」　　設法救濟的啊！我們怎麽辦呢？倫敦會議應該使各國政府都决定於同時减少貨幣内所含的黄金數量百分之三十六。像這種一致的行動，到底能獲得什麽結果呢？我們可以說，一切中央銀行的藏金，立卽可以較現在實價增加到百分之五十五；因此卽可以獲得下列的結果：（Ａ）有許多的中央銀行，牠們的準備金，在今日只有百分之二十到百分之二十五，以後立卽可以超出法定限制之上，增加到百分之三十至四十的程度，而且對於牠們發行的紙幣之兌現，更能增加强量的可能性。（Ｂ）黄金比較缺乏的銀行，也可以使之接近這些法定的限制，並且基於貨幣數量的增加，牠們能够漸漸的回復業務。（Ｃ）富足的銀行，正可以把牠們過剩的黄金借給國家作一種「公共基金」，藉以恢復資本的自由流通，保證用金本位各國間相互的自由行動。」</p>
<p>這上面的話，便是竇萊西新計劃的内容與理由，他似乎很謹愼很小心，不以誇大爲務，他所期望達到的目的也很有限，這比較一般專以誇大自榮的遊方郎中式的經濟學家，自是更勝一籌了。然而竇萊西氏的錯誤，我們也不能不提出來，以供大家的研究。</p>
<p>黄金在今日太昻貴，這是竇萊西氏底理論的出發點。在今日要想購買與四年前同一數量的商品，已經用不着四年前那麽多的黄金了。竇萊西的這個論證，確是不能辯駁的事實。但不幸得很，說一切貨幣的貶價（卽减少貨幣的黄金成分），便能補救這個物價低落的恐慌，那却是一個絶大的疑問。</p>
<p>貨幣的貶價與减少貨幣中黄金成分，到底有什麽意義呢？假定一盎司黄金（約三十格拉姆）鑄成兩塊貨幣：每塊貨幣包含十五個格拉姆黄金。依照竇拉西氏的提議，將貨幣價格减低百分之三十六（約計之，約减低原價三分之一），我們便必須將原有貨幣削去三分之一的重量。此後用以鑄成兩塊貨幣的一盎司黄金，可以鑄成三塊貨幣：每塊貨幣便以十格拉姆轉重量代替了十五格拉姆的重量。貨幣雖如此的變其價格，而加利福尼亞州的金鑛主仍能繼續以一盎司的黄金購買七基羅又五十七的商品。在這個事情上面，絶對是毫無變化的。黄金仍舊和以前一樣的昻貴啊！不過這一盎司的黄金，由兩塊十五格拉姆的貨幣，變爲三塊十格拉姆的貨幣罷了。倘若是這個輕量的貨幣和以前得量的貨幣，用同一的名辭，例如英金仍名金鎊，法幣仍名佛郎的話，則這種的貨幣轉變運動，只不過增高百分之五十的名目上的物價而已。例如購買同一數量的商品，以前需要兩塊貨幣，貨幣貶價三分之一以後，便　需要三塊貨幣了；以三塊代替兩塊，六塊代替四塊，九塊代替六塊，等等，名目上的物價固然是增高了百分之五十；但此後三塊貨幣和現在兩塊貨幣所含的黄金數量完全是一樣，則黄金與商品間的　係到底有什麽變動呢！原來絲毫没有變動的啊！加利福尼亞州的金鑛主，固然在一九三三年和一九二九年一樣，用兩塊貨幣購買四基羅又八十四的商品，但是他的一盎司黄金旣然値三塊貨幣，那第三塊貨幣仍可以購買其餘的數量，結果還不是他的一盎司黄金仍能購買七基羅又五十七的商品麽！</p>
<p>竇萊西的計劃假定能夠實行，果能獲得他所希望的結果麽？各國的中央銀行果眞能藉此增加百分之五十五的貨幣價格麽？當然啊，每塊貨幣已經削去三分之一的黄金，各中央銀行的准備金，當然容許多鑄百分之五十五的貨幣，或多發行百分之五十五的補足的紙幣。倘若各中央銀行不發行補足的紙幣，則其准備金與其發行的紙幣的比例，自是比較以前優越了。但牠們查能抑制不多發行紙幣麽？倘若說現在要購買和以前同量的商品，必需由兩塊貨幣增加到三塊貨幣，那麽爲保證商品的流通起見，便必須多發行一些紙幣。因爲要使名目上的物價在高漲之後適合减輕重量後的新貨幣單位的數量，則流通的紙幣也同樣要增加百分之五十五，而各銀行的准備金，仍舊和以前絶對一樣的不夠。基於這個論證，我們可以說，竇拉西氏的結論中ＡＢＣ三點都不能成立。</p>
<p>但竇拉西底理論的出發點，在相當　圍之内，也還有他的立足之點。各債權人收受貶價的貨幣以後，只能購買現在的商品的三分之二，恰如一九二九年同樣的數量。工商業的負債從此可以减輕，而工商業的資本也能夠從此比較的活動了。可是，事情原不是如是節單的：一方面，這樣的减　負擔，未見得一定就可以增進生產，另一方面，因失業恐慌而日就衰弱的工資勞動者，雖然增加了一點名目的工資，但以物價的高漲，得不償失，其痛苦更甚於往日；工資勞動者的購買力，不但没有增加，甚至還要减少，商品的自由流通，生產與消費的適合，是否能夠實現，還是一個疑問。</p>
<p>貨幣貶價對於大多數的工資勞動者是絲毫没有利益的。他們已經在經濟恐慌的凶濤惡浪中受苦也盡夠了。竇拉西氏的貨幣貶價計劃，固然使物價在名目上高漲了，但大多數人的購買力仍不能增加，這對於生產停滯及商品堆積的恐慌，到底有什麽補救的效果呢！他這個計劃惟一的意義，只有使債務人減輕一點黄金的負檐，尤其是使歐洲債務國可以減輕對於美國的　　　擔面已。</p>
<p>我們要想在倫敦會議　設法　出一點提高　　購買力的議案，但結果是等於零。我們　，要想補救這生產過剩及消費不及的恐慌，道惟一的方法，是要使一般勞動的人民，能夠消費他們所生產的貨物。這是最合　　的補救辦法。但資本自有牠的　輯，牠的選輯是建立在利潤的上面。資本家主要生產各種商品，並不是爲工資勞動者製造禮品，他是要收穫最高的利潤啊！要想提高羣衆的購買力，便必然要增加工資勞動者的工資，若增加工資勞動者的工資，便必然會引起利潤的低落。一般資本家終是不能允許的。所以倫敦會議，這帝國主義者鈎心鬭爭的戱劇，這金融資本家爭奇競勝的賽會，决不會注意到提高羣衆購買力的這一點—貨幣貶價，物價高漲，雖能粉飾門面地繁榮於一時，但終竟是一現的曇花，不是根本解决世界經濟恐慌的辦法。</p>

<h3 id="c231">論女智識分子的出路 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>前幾天的本刋載着兩篇關於智識分子出路的文字，在這兩篇文字中充分地流露着智識分子的牢騷，讀了以後禁不住使人喟然長歎。是啊，在這麽错沉的年頭兒，所謂智識分子的出路根本就談不到，智識分子的到了末路，倒是千眞萬確的事實。</p>
<p>不過，我忽然想到，這裹的所謂「智識分子，」似乎應當只限於男性的，因爲我覺得在目前，女智識分子的出路却是正在發展着，女智識分子的出路却多得很，至少要比『苦命』的男人多罷。只單就本刋上的『自我職業介紹』作一個籠統的觀察，女人得到『回音』的要比男子來得多，而投稿的却是男子多於女人的。從這直覺的觀察所得，則可知在現實的社會中，女人的『命』實在比男子的好，至少可以說，女人找出路要比男子容易。所以現在的『女智識分子』是大可不必像白璧君所說的那樣去『當娘姨。』而在事實上也正是如此：大學畢業生當茶房有之；拉黄包車似乎也頗有之！而『女智識分子』之當娘姨，則未之聞也。</p>
<p>因此，做現代父母的人縱然擁着好幾個『經綸滿腹』的七尺『丈夫子，』說不定也只能黯然地看他們坐在家裹喫飯，倒反不如有一個如花似玉的女兒，做父母的『榮華富貴，』却是『拿得穩』的。從這現社會中事實表現的結果，『不重生男重生女』的思想是無疑地已在做父母者的心中活躍了。</p>
<p>於是有人要問，女兒家究竟具了什麽優越的條件，竟這樣的容易找到『出路』呢？這我可以直截了當的回答：『女人所以容易找到飯碗（出路）只是因爲她是女人。』這第二個『女人』是很費解的，我在這裹不能詳細解釋了，讀者可參閱一下各報上陸續發表的『花瓶』論，就能明白。（報上發表的關於『花瓶』的言論大槪可以彙訂成册了吧。）</p>
<p>『女人』之能成爲謀出路的先决條件，一半固由於『天賦，』一半却也賴乎她的『聰明，』譬如『天賦』有了缺陷，她就會『聰明』地爬到胭缸裹打個筋斗去彌補牠，（反之，『天賦』有特殊的優點，她自然會更聰明地利用各種方法去襯托它的。）這個筋斗自然可以打出一條『出路』來！</p>
<p>話雖是這麽說，我却不能替那胭脂缸中打筋斗的『女智識分子』没有顧慮，因爲假如一旦社會上消失了『喫胭脂』的哥兒，那你縱然在胭脂缸裹打了一百個筋斗也不會打出一條『出路』來吧。</p>
<p>所以，歸根結蒂，女智識分子的出路也實在是靠不住的。</p>
<p>現在女子的似乎有『出路，』只不過是資本主義社會畸形發展的一種姿態罷了。</p>
<p>男女智識分子們，你們都已走到了末路了。如果要打開一條光明的出路，用你們的『聰明』吧，不成！用你們的『胭脂』吧，不成！祗有用你們的『智識，』</p>
<p>用你們的汗和力！</p>
<h3 id="c232">大學畢業生的出路 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 潔白</p>
<p>五位大學畢業生坐在一個狹窄而不大淸潔的亭子間裹談現代一般靑年所苦惱的出路問題，談來談去，大家都深深地覺得在現社會上任便　什麽地方也都没有他們的路！</p>
<p>學識較深，能力較富的Ａ君很氣忿的說：我那所販來的東西—學識並不是壞，没有用，只因現社會的消費基礎太狹窄，以至陷我們於無路可走。</p>
<p>社會經騐較富的Ｂ君很莊嚴的說：但是，社會消費基礎之所以日漸狹獈，也並是大學畢業生供過於求的促成，而是現社會上的一切被那毫無知識的，學棍······所把持之必然的結果。假若你們不信我所說的話，那只要你們稍一留意南京政府和其他各地的行政人員，有幾個是大學畢業生，便可以證實我們的話是現實的。</p>
<p>受了許多社會刺擊的Ｃ君很消極的說：總之，現社會的特徵是前無路，後也無路，依我看來，我們還是去做和尙吧！因爲去做和尙不但可以避免現社會上一切的騷攪，而又可以度淸閑而快活的生活呢！</p>
<p>不大好說話的Ｄ君很興奮的站起來說：我很贊成Ｃ君的意見去做和尙，不過我有一個聲明，我們若去做和尙要有基督敎徒的精神，就是說我們應當把過去散漫中國和尙的特性改革，使之組織化，將來，我們一有機會，便可以領導他們來改革中國社會。</p>
<p>較有社會學修養的Ｅ君似反對而非反對的樣子，面孔上滿佈喜色的說：我是贊成Ｄ君的精神，但不贊成Ｄ君所說的對象——只到和尙羣中去組織和尙，就是說我們應把那種改造和建設的精神擴大一些，任便什麽人都是我們的對象，只要他們是與我們同一運命和意識，便可以的。大家都覺得Ｅ君的意見比較妥貼和較有意義，而一同的認他所說的話爲結論了，同時，他們又共同的說要根據Ｅ君的結論繼續不斷的去探求「光明之路」呢！</p>

<p>— 潔心</p>
<p>「老天呀！怎麽這樣狠毒啊！你把我的兩個孩子都收拾去了！心肝啊，兒呀，你的媽媽這大聲音喊兒，兒也不答應你的媽媽？心肝，内呀······」</p>
<p>已是午夜時分了。從間壁灶披間裹傳來一陣哀號把我從夢境裹驚醒：接着便是這一套悲痛凄楚的哭訴·—這是一個女人的聲音。</p>
<p>那個女人，我只要一意識到她，腦子裹便會自然地明顯地浮出一個尖臉厚嘴唇，赤脚拖鞋，長頭髮，胸前一粒鈃子從來不扭，講起話來先會笑而帶着鼻音的三十多歲的中年婦人的影子。與她同居的除了一個成天躱在家裹「躺烟舖」或是「擦烟槍」的把「抽鴉片」當職業的丈夫以外，還有兩個孩子—大的一個在前不多天患赤痢死了；小的一個，在她的哭鬧聲中，大槪又是死了。</p>
<p>夜來的吵鬧，害得我半夜不得成眠；天將曉時，我得着片刻的安寗，我便睡了一𥇰。大槪是在十點鐘光景，我還�</p>
<p>在朦朧的飄飄然的感覺的時候，忽然外面鬧着震天地的鞭砲聲，又把我驚覺了，我就想，這已死的孩子又不知被送到那裹去了，弄堂裹接着也因此有好些人在議論着：</p>
<p>「這孩子還是死的限；窮人養得活甚麽孩子？與其　孩子活着受罪，不如給這小生命毁滅了還來得干凈！」</p>
<p>另外的一種附和的聲音是這樣的；　　本來這女人太不安份了些，自作的孽！死去了自已的丈夫，便應當帶着兩個孩子好好的守寡過活，吃一些眼前苦，將來孩子撫養成人，多少是有一線希望的，但她不肯安份，一定要嫁人，偏偏又嫁給這樣一個活寳貝，這不是活該？！·········」</p>
<p>「············」</p>
<p>「·········」他們滔滔地繼續大發其「世風」和「人心」的議論，語調是極其憤慨的嘆息的啊，「窮人不應有孩了」，好一個聰明乾脆而又奇妙的結論！「安份守寡」，又是何等漂高悅耳而又滑稽的推斷！可是這此，我甚麽都不了解，在我腦子裹存在着的，只是人與其他一切動物都是同樣有生命的，餓了要吃！誰說的那一條生命是有權利存在，而那一條生命是應該毁滅的呢？！······</p>

<p>— 瘏馬</p>
<p>有許多人，好像杞人憂天，鬧着「農村崩潰一，「農村經濟破產」，其實是皮相之談。有一般「深知卓見」明白農民情形的，還覺得農民的奢侈習慣，有糾正的必要。况且各省的農村，只要有一筆鉅欵，加以改革跣興，那末不久的將來，就有農村都市化的希望。花團錦簇，光華爘爛，有了大計畫，不怕不成大事業。事在人爲，現在且把復興農村的方法，寫在後面。</p>
<p>（一）放闊田岸，舖築柏油馬路，以便行駛汽車。</p>
<p>（二）塡塞河道，裝設自來水，以免農民車水之勞。并且飲料淸潔，有益衛生。</p>
<p>（三）農民應將燈光如豆的油盞，洋油燈，一律抛棄，家家户户改用電燈。　　（四）建築高大洋房，跳舞廳，以便農民得到正當的娛樂。</p>
<p>（五）設立醫院，以保障農民之生命，維持農民之健康。</p>
<p>（六）開設銀行，以便　農民之儲蓄。　　（七）改良儉嗇的習慣。</p>
<p>（八）設警探，以保護農村。</p>
<p>（九）農民應抛棄扁擔，不用找棒，而改用新式的運貨汽車。</p>
<p>（十）農民不可科頭跣足，應衣冠整潔，以壯觀瞻。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c235">各得其所 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>編者先行；</p>
<p>每讀店員通訊，見所答之事，無不詳明，指導有方，匡正有理；從可知編者先生之不憚煩，有誨人不惓之意。今鄙人有一件瑣事，請敎於先生，幸勿見拒爲盼</p>
<p>先　父兄弟四人，分居時，仲叔遷出祖宅一伯與季共分祖宅一所，伯占東面，季占西面。伯生二子，東面之房，固爲伯子二人分有；而伯之次子，將分得之房，早已盡數賣與季手；今伯長子分得之房，亦欲出售於季。奈季現金拮据，無力購買；伯季二家，本係近族，遂倡議季以良田若干，換伯長子之房，所謂以產易產，互立換約。不知此種辦法，在法律習慣上，是否可行，乞示明敎，無任感激之至。專此敬頌文安。趙雪岩拜上</p>
<p>編者按：法律規定，一個人對於其所有之不動產，有自由處置之權。所謂處置，包括使用，出租，出抵，贈與，　出讓，出賣而言也。所以季以良田若干，易伯長子的房產當然是一種合法行爲。不過訂約時，也要請中證人在塲作證：事後也須估價完納契稅，過户承糧耳。愈是近親，手續愈須辦得妥貼，免得後輩因爲疑惑而發生糾紛。</p>
<p>這件事對於伯季兩方，均有利益；季旣統有全屋四分之三，當然對於這四分之一，勢在必得；伯旣需用欵，整塘的良田，當然也比較牽絲攀籐的房屋容易換踐；各得其所，的是一個絶好的建議。</p>

<p>（二十八）三姨太貪　地看着他走去的後影</p>
<p>互相又瞪視了一回，美子笑了，但石喬却改成了一種沉痛的嚴重表情，顯然他心中已另有所决定。他緩慢地說道：</p>
<p>「我親愛的美子，謝謝你的鼓勵！」</p>
<p>美子頓時也沉下臉來，担心着有什麽事發生似的。</p>
<p>「立哈諾夫等着你了，早去睡罷」石喬說出這話，顯然是克制了熱烈的情感。但是隨即又抱緊了美子，給了他一陣狂亂的熱吻，然後推開請她去睡。美子依依不捨地站住門檻邊長久不走，表情裹帶着一種虔誠的祈禱。</p>
<p>石喬待美子走出後，關着門一個人淸理着書籍信札，决定離開這裹，開始建造新的環境，新的生命。在他淸理東西的瞬間，好像在淸理他一生的糊塗賬似的。過去所有的經騐，思想，感映，一件地來到他的腦際，又一件件地結束起來。接着一種童年的歡愉，少年的熱望使他臉上卦上滿臉的微笑，微笑裹又幻出了周紹平的英勇的音容，以及那封慷慨激昻的信—是的·他的話全然不錯·好的·讓過過都死了罷。且看今晚，那羣衆熱烈的情形，可不是顯見老大民族的精魂在呵欠中甦活了轉來，不，大喊一聲醒轉來了。姑無論石川陣亡的消息是否眞實，反正由這熱烈的情形，已給予了任何人對於民族復興的堅信。</p>
<p>祗要民心没有死盡·祗要歷史没有腐蝕完·這完全靠我們埋頭硬幹起來的，眞的，勾鼻子也這樣相信·『日本决不是我們的敵手！』他一邊想着，東西已快淸理好。東方已漸露出魚肚色，窗玻璃已映成乳白。於是輕輕地把幾件行李，獨自搬到樓下庭階前，因爲他怕驚醒美子，特寫了一封簡短的信並封好一個月的房錢在裹面，留在房裹。别了，我親愛的美子姑娘！他心裹喊着，手揮送着飛吻—啊，但願我美子幸福，終有一天光榮地回到她的故土，而那故土已非豺狼的所在！别了，親愛的美子，祝你安眠，他便到馬路轉角處去喊人力車，兩旁的街樹在黎明中漸耀成一片翠綠，忽然一輛汽車從靜寂的遠處馳來，而且意外地在他面前停下。車箱裹走出一個艷裝的女人，這女人就是三姨太，她因爲看見李石喬才聽汽車停下的。她形色異常倉促，却勉强裝出媚笑，微　中，仍能看出她唇上的櫻紅·但這祗使李石喬生厭，他遠遠地站着不動。三姨走近來說道：</p>
<p>『石喬；這樣早就到那裹去！』</p>

<h3 id="c239">明星們的黑影（下） <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇信</p>
<p>是他們的替身是他們的勁敵</p>
<p>公司方面駕馭明星們的工具</p>
<p>米高梅公司的一位經理先生，有一天遇見了一個少年。因爲他很像加雷古柏，於是就把他羅致了來，和他訂了合同。並且還替他改了一個名字。他本來呌亞基李次，而他的新名字是呌喀雷加倫ＣａｒｙＧｒａｎｔ，和加雷古柏幾乎差不多。公司方面並且常常將與加雷古柏身份差不多的角色給喀雷加倫去扮演。但是加雷古柏比公司裡的經理們還要調皮。也很小心謹愼的作事，呌他做什麽，他就做什麽。這樣一來喀雷加倫就没有機會去搶他的地位了。</p>
<p>因爲利用這種做黑影子的人，是公司方面控制明星們的好方法，所以不僅派拉蒙或米高梅採用這種方法，而其他各影片公司亦都如法泡製了。華納兄弟公司亦有兩個姓名相近，面貌彷彿，個性差不多的兩個演員。一個是華納的明星威廉包衛爾ＷｉｌｌｉａｍＰｏｗｅｌｌ；華倫威廉ＷａｒｒｅｎＷｆｌｌｉａｍ。有一次包衛爾不喜歡ＴｈｅＭｏｕｔｈｐｉｅｃｅ的劇本，公司方面就將那本戲給威廉做了。後來又有一本ＴｈｅＤａｒｋＨｏｒｓｅ包衛爾又不高興做，公司方面又給威廉去做了。這兩齣戯都是包衛所認爲絶對做不好的，但是威廉做來，恰到好處，能將平凡的故事，演成精警的影片；他的名　亦就這樣響起來了。包衛爾是向來很自負的，可是現在受了這個黑影子的威脅，亦不敢太放任了。</p>
<p>環球公司的　亞勒斯，近幾年來對於他公司裡派給他的角色，總覺得不滿意。公司裡覺得他一天比一天的難以駕御，於是尋到了一位肯德島格拉斯，和他訂了長期合同。肯德在ＷａｒｅｒｌｏｏＢｅｉｄｇｅ和ＡＨｏｕｓｅＤｉｖｉｄｅｄ兩張片子裡，已經證明他的表演天才，並不在劉亞勒斯之下。不過肯德是舞台上的人物，他不喜歡作電影，所以他合同滿後，仍舊脫離了電影。但是劉亞勒斯所受到的敎訓，亦就不差了。</p>
<p>羅伯蒙高茂亦有一個替身呌做羅伯楊。他在「萬花獻媚」等片子裡，亦已證明他非但風度翩翩，和蒙高茂一樣，並且態度自然，表演純熟，可以完全代替蒙高茂。在米曲羅公司裡，有一位法蘭蘇通者，亦可以完全代替那認爲男性典型的克拉克蓋博。克拉克蓋博近來脾氣很大，公司方面覺得他很難駕御，可以他們能夠尋着這位法蘭蘇通做他的替身，他們就覺得穩當些了。</p>
<p>福斯公司在這方面，是比較的落後些。却爾斯法雷走了，他們至今還没有找到一個可以代替他的人，却爾斯慕豋本來很有希望，但表演得大差了。他們找了一位亞塞爾比爾生，想用他做傑梅鄧的黑影子，但試騐結果，亦告失敗了。</p>
<p>在雷電華公司裡的安哈定，現在亦受了這黑影子的威脅。這黑影子就是仇理海豋，她的相貌和安哈定很相彿彿。在ＴｈｅＣｏｎｑｕｅｒｏｒｓ一片裡，仇理扮作安哈定的女兒，兩兩相比，竟莫分彼此呢。至於像葛萊泰嘉寳，好的黑影子最多，於是有了許多美國嘉寳，德國嘉寳等名稱出來。但直到現在，他們還未能將這瑞典的怪明星完全打倒。（完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>新頴的題材，華麗的演出，</p>
<p>歌劇中的上等作品。—南京映</p>
<p>首先我們覺得滿意的，便是這一歌劇的取材新頴。他以諷刺商人逢迎權勢爲主題，雖然以喜劇的形式演出，可是那種使人哭笑不得的情調，的確是使我們不得不敬服作者的成功。</p>
<p>支店的經理爲了要博得總店老　的歡心，除了敎店員們極力承歡之外，還使妻子盛裝奉陪，設筵招待。但妻欲携其愛术作陪，這當然不成體統，於是與夫口角而憤然携其愛犬外出，老闆忽至，不得已權以女書記代妻。於是老闆雖愛書記的艷色，然因她是僱員之妻，也只得飄飄然而已。不意妻忽然因各劇塲都拒絶携犬入内之故而返家，得知如此情形，怒甚，後經丈夫解釋，乃冒充爲女書記趨庭見客。總經理乃向此假書記曲意承歡，妻亦故作妖態以報復丈夫，於是丈夫强顏歡樂，啼笑皆非。其後在舞塲夜總會等處，酒醉歸來，此中底細，亦完全敗露。於是總經理携其女書記偕去，完成了喜劇所改塲。</p>
<p>如上所述，我們認爲這一歌劇的成功，决不僅僅是演出形式的華麗完美，而是這劇内容的深刻。我們當讀着契霍甫的小說的時候，每覺得有一種辛辣的苦味流露在字裹行間。蕭伯訥的作口，　　更正：昨日本刋評「一枝花」一文，因記者一時没有參考書，稍有錯誤。作者殷格蘭本爲有名導演，而這一影片乃是其近作，並非第一次導演。茲特更正。也有着這同樣的作風，甚至比前者更爲眞摯痛快。所謂寓譏諷於笑駡之中，這種譁笑的悲哀，正是上述諸作家偉大之處。不消說，文學在電影藝術中佔着主要的部份，所以有許多喜劇，並不是完全因着演出的胡閙而失敗，而是因着内容的過於空虚，有如在紙人身上穿着華麗的外衣，無論如何，也没有保障成功之可能的。因此，這一影片的成功，正因爲有着相當充實的内容而决定了劇的成功之可能性。我們看，雖然這裹所寫的都是一些家庭小事，但是在這頗有眞實性的小事中能緊緊的把握而充分發揮，正是作者的深刻，可以說，在現社會中的商人們的醜態，正是很眞實的暴露出來。</p>
<p>演出，也是很能和内容一致的。特别是喜劇的形式，而居然如此不事誇張，更爲可取。也許有人說，分店經理和女書記酒醉歸來的時候，在樓梯上顚倒的步伐，過於受了音樂韻律的限制，然而這是不慣於看Ｏｐｅｒ的成見，反之，這正是這一歌劇的得意的塲合。在「百萬金」中我們也同樣看着如此方法的運用，然而因着「百萬金」不能像這一影片有着統一的活潑情調，以致被人忽視。科就整個的演出說，我們不獨承認導演有着新奇的手段，而最主要的是情調的不沉悶或鬆懈，自首至尾都使人們在大聲歡笑中感着人生的悲哀。特别是丈夫望着妻子在别人懷抱裹的親暱態度，爲了一隻狗雖然對妻低聲下氣的安慰終至决裂，爲了討好老闆而在跳舞時跌了又跌，終於得不着老闆的歡心，這些這些，主要賈克卜淦南眞是描寫得深刻入微。其餘三個配角演員也很恰當。</p>
<p>在這一影片中，我們固然不能看着絲毫積極性，可是小市民的沉痛的怨恨，始終是可以博得我們的同情。如此，我們得承認這是前進的小市民藝術家適可而止的作品。</p>
<p>天一笑談二則</p>
<h3 id="c241">害得大家做窮鬼 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>天一以前的影片，佈景服裝，大都富麗堂皇。近來因爲劇本題材，傾向到農村方面去，因之劇中的佈景服裝，也大大的轉變。最可笑的，是幾個女演員，平時穿慣華美的衣服，一旦換了農家婦女的裝束，看上去很是别致。像「掙」「吉地」中的陳玉梅，「飛絮」中的袁美雲，王慧娟，「飄零」中的胡珊，陸麗霞。「苦兒流浪記」中的邵素霞，陸劍芬，所着的衣服，好一點的是一種式樣不合時的布衣，有的甚至百孔千瘡，襤褸不堪，如果不是拍戯，這種破爛衣服，好們再也不肯上身。胡珊常對人笑說，「邵老闆的算盤眞精明。他爲了添置服裝的費用太犬，所以想出這種農村戯來。只要幾件破舊的布衣，可以省却一筆服裝費。却害得我們大家做窮鬼。」</p>
<h3 id="c242">她此刻正在餧鷄 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>陳玉梅自「生機」「掙扎」攝竣後，接連着主演「吉地」。本來熱天拍戲，是最苦惱的，偏偏「吉地」外景特别多，一會兒江灣，一會兒林家花園，一會兒三林糖，在流金鑠石的烈日底下，趕來趕去拍戲，實在有點受不住。現在外景已拍竣，大可以休息一會，但她旣反對跳舞，又不喜游泳，天氣炎熱，籃球足球又不能打，她没有消遣的方法，只好看看小說，或是和邵醉翁的兒女們着着象棋。昨天有三個女學生去訪陳玉梅，她穿着一套玄色拷綢衫褲，腦後梳着兩條短辮，正在餧小洋鷄。這幾位女學生，雖然在銀幕上見過陳玉梅，但萬想不到她是這般服裝，以爲是陳家的娘姨。便問道，「陳玉梅小姐在家麽？」陳玉梅笑道，「她比刻正在飼鷄，請問諸位有什麽事？」女學生覺得這話大有幽默意味，知道這人便是陳玉梅，倒弄得不好意思，連忙向她道歉，自咎有眼不識泰山。</p>

<p>是的，國產影片在目前萌芽時代，需要我們的提倡和擁護；不過，只是一味空洞的讚美，没有理智的稱頌，却反而會使國片日趨退化和没落的途徑的。</p>
<p>像最近公映的聯華新片「母性之光」一樣，許多影評者都一致稱頌牠「偉大」，「完美，」，「意旘健全」，「故事現實」······但是，究竟偉大在那裹？健全在那裹？影評中找不見隻字的明證，畫片上更不曾有絲毫的顯露。公司的廣告中宣傳着：（一）對母性的偉大有深刻入骨的描寫；（二）對女人的虚榮有正確意識的提引；（三）對拜金主義者有沉痛的雷頭捧喝；（四）對男性的貪慾有現實詳盡的暴露。但，這僅僅是廣告中的宣傳吧了。這些只不過是片中極微小的描寫。尤其是對于母性的指示更犯了嚴重的錯誤。像慧英是個母性的代表，她應該在一切表現上，顯示她的勇敢，毅力，用鐵的意志來戰勝一切，克服一切困難疑慮。慧英愛她的小梅，但小梅和黄書麟的結婚，何以竟不和寄梅有反抗的行動；母性的愛僅僅是讓女兒去染虚榮的習慣。一九三三年的母性，恐怕不是這樣間單吧。</p>
<p>第二，說到小梅的母性吧？懺悔着過去，去替大衆服務。在托兒所裹做一點事情，就是替大衆服務嗎？托兒所，就是代替女工們看護小孩的塲所，但母性之光裹的托兒所，像幼稚圍，那末，小梅，慧英，······都僅僅是爲着自已的生活的工作，决不是托兒所中替大衆在服務了。畫面告訴我們的只有如此。</p>
<p>第三，巧遇太多。音樂會慧英家瑚相遇巧，小梅成歌后巧，爲托兒所募捐演唱巧，小梅嫁一着黄書麟產了女兒而脫離夫婦巧，偏生豋台演唱而她的小女死得巧，眞是無巧不成話，這種地方，充分表現得故事是多麽牽强啊！</p>

<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>西摩正問著「就是這位小姐嗎？」於是海傑斯替他們介紹了。海傑斯告訴伊　他已經和西摩講過了，請他帮忙給她一些事情做。西摩很客氣地，詳細問她以前的一切經騐。伊　又將她的履歷重新背了一遍。最後西摩對她說現在没有什麽事給她做。請她將地址留下以便日後通信。可是伊蘩不願意將她現在所住的不好聽的地方告訴人家，所以她祗寫了一個名字，而說她一兩天就要搬家，她可以自已再來的。於是海傑斯就領了她走了。她又一定還要到裡面去和意士頓告别。她告訴意士頓倘使將來麗妲華儂的表演不滿意的時候，儘管呌她代替好了。這幾句話弄得意士頓薛立丹等都面面相覷，不知所云。</p>
<p>伊蘩露蘭絲走了之後，薛立丹向意士頓道：「我想這女子肚子裹有些東西」。意士頓望了薛立丹一眼道：「她肚子裡有一顆大胆。」但是薛立丹想起了她批評麗妲華儂不配表演「金枝」的話，心中覺得對她起了無限的同情，並且佩服他的眼光不差。</p>
<p>在此後的幾個月之中，伊蘩總是念念不忘她和路易斯意士頓第一次見面時的光景。日子是一天比一天艱難，不過無論誰都不能奪去伊蘩從這次會面所發生的希望。她獨自做著秘密的夢，她想總有一天，這夢會實現的，但在目前呢，她束束緊她的腰帶，表示與飢餓的誓不兩立，她天天出去尋求她的勝利之途。她心中又懷念着薛立丹，因爲薛立丹曾經給她一些機會。那是一個小角色，她覺弄糟了，所以也不想見他了。她有時悚然於失敗之無可避免，内又受了飢餓的驅迫，生命的飢餓，事業的飢餓，尤其足飲食的飢餓。於是她小事情亦不得不接受了。但是事情越小越難見她的長處。她常自已問自已，到底她會成名不會成名，她却有必須立卽成名的必要。</p>
<p>又是冬天到了，伊蘩露　絲在紐約的第二個冬天。凄凄的寒雨下着，那天黄昏，伊蘩從她的寓所裹溜了出來，要去尋些東西吃。她的錢袋告訴她祗可以喝一杯咖啡。她在那破舊的咖啡店裡，呌了一杯咖啡。她肚子裡而得了些咖啡的暖氣，舒適了許多，她外面還要裝着這是一頓飽食後的咖啡。忽然一個很熟的聲音喚她。（未完）</p>

<p>The Anti-Japanese Allied Army Has Concluded</p>
<p>All Troops Stationed in Chahar Province to be Gathered North of Zhangjiakou and Reorganized by Song</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou Telegram: Feng Yuxiang decided to leave Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 14th, taking a special train belonging to Song Zheyuan to Tai'an, residing on Mount Tai. Song will personally escort him to the vicinity of Beiping and Tianjin. It is reported that Han Fuqu of Shandong has dispatched an armored train to welcome him, which is expected to arrive at Nankou on the morning of the 13th. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The post-war issues of the various Chahar Province armies will be handled by Song Zheyuan in accordance with the instructions of the central government and the North China authorities. Currently, Feng Yuxiang's troops in Chahar still number 40,000, all of whom have been concentrated in the Gaodu, Wanquan, and Zhangbei areas, awaiting reorganization. Ji Hongchang's troops may also request reorganization. Because Song Zheyuan has resumed his post, and someone is responsible for the military and political affairs of Chahar Province, Feng has decided to leave Zhangjiakou on the morning of the 14th with a small number of guards in a special train, traveling south along the Ping Sui Railway, transferring at Fengtai, and going directly to Mount Tai in Shandong Province to pursue his mountain dwelling, reading, and calligraphy studies. He will not stop in Beiping. Song has decided to accompany him past Beiping. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng returned to Beiping from Zhangjiakou at 5:15 PM on the 13th. According to Jiang, after Song arrived in Zhangjiakou, all takeovers proceeded very smoothly. Feng originally planned to leave Zhangjiakou on the 13th, but Song said that since he had just resumed his post, the handover had not yet been completed, and requested Feng to stay one more day. It is now decided that Song will accompany Feng in a special train to leave Zhangjiakou for Shandong on the morning of the 14th, going to Mount Tai to reside. They will not stay long when passing through Beiping and Tianjin. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang Bocheng, upon returning to Beiping, said that he was ordered to go to Chahar on the 11th. When he arrived at Xuanhua that evening, Song and Pang Bingxun were both there. They discussed the post-war issues of Chahar Province and the reorganization of the provincial government. In the afternoon of the 12th, he traveled to Zhangjiakou with Song. The people of Zhangjiakou warmly welcomed Song, and Feng personally went to the station. Song got out of the car and went to the New Village with Feng for talks. Feng decided to leave Zhangjiakou immediately, originally scheduled to go south from Zhangjiakou today, but because Song was willing to accompany Feng through Beiping, Song decided to travel together on the morning of the 14th, as he had just completed the takeover of the provincial government and there were many things to be organized. I (Jiang Bocheng) returned to Beiping first to report to He Yingqin on my visit to Zhangjiakou. All troops stationed in Chahar Province have been gathered in the area north of Zhangjiakou and will be reorganized by Song in the future. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan and Jiang Bocheng entered Zhangjiakou on the afternoon of the 12th, Song immediately met with Feng to discuss post-war arrangements, deciding that Feng would leave Zhangjiakou in the near future to reside temporarily on Mount Tai in Shandong. Song went to the provincial government at 2 PM to assume his duties. Feng will come south in a special train on the morning of the 14th, stopping briefly when passing through Beiping, then transferring at Fengtai and traveling via the Pingpu Railway to Tai'an, where he may meet with Han Fuqu in Ji'nan. It is confirmed that the headquarters of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army was dissolved on the 7th. The military and political post-war issues of Chahar Province will be handled entirely by Song Zheyuan in accordance with the central government's intentions and the orders of the Beiping authorities. The Chahar Provincial Government will be reorganized in the near future, but the candidates for the various department heads have not yet been determined. (Central Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin telegraphed Fang Zhenwu, saying, "At this critical moment of national crisis and survival, we rely on everyone's collective wisdom and effort to undertake the arduous task of saving the situation and seeking survival. You, my brother, love the country no less than others, and I have always admired you for this. I sincerely hope that you will come to Beiping to serve as a member of the Military Council, to assist and work together to save the critical situation. I will be responsible for all your safety. Please let me know when you will come south so that I can instruct the troops along the way to provide careful protection and send someone to meet you." (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Weifan said that he had just received a telegram from Song summoning him to Zhangjiakou. Song will handle matters such as the reorganization of Chahar Province and the post-war issues of Chahar Province at his discretion. He (Zhang Weifan) will temporarily maintain his position as the head of the Construction Department in accordance with orders. Feng Zhi'an's division's third regiment is scheduled to depart for Zhangjiakou within the next few days. Feng may travel with his troops because they still need to wait for train transportation. Wu Zhensheng's regiment stationed in Zhang Yuan will also be transferred to Zhangjiakou. The entire 29th Army will be stationed on the Ping Sui Railway, and the military headquarters established in Beiping will be abolished. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan's Chief of Staff, Zhang Weifan, went to Zhangjiakou this afternoon after receiving a telegram from Song. It is rumored that Zhang will be appointed as the head of the Construction Department of the Chahar Provincial Government. Xiao Zhenying and others saw him off at the station. Xiao returned to Beiping from Xuanhua last night. According to him, Song had previously telegraphed Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei to resign from his position as Chairman of Chahar, and had received a reply from Jiang and Wang expressing their condolences and urging him to stay. Therefore, Song still went to Zhangjiakou on the 12th to resume his post. However, Song believes that military personnel should not be in charge of government, and that his back pain flares up from time to time, so he intends to resign again after the post-war issues in Chahar have been properly handled, and focus on training troops. The Chahar Provincial Government has decided to maintain the status quo and not reorganize it for the time being. The demobilization and reorganization of the various troops in Chahar will be handled in accordance with the orders of the Military Council. Fang Zhenwu's troops and others are now stationed north of Wanquan, awaiting demobilization and reorganization. Song's division, led by Feng Tai'an, has decided to move entirely to Chahar. There are still two regiments left in Pingdong, which will depart within the next few days. Feng is also scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou within a day or two. Feng Yuxiang has agreed to go south voluntarily and choose a suitable address to live in, and is expected to leave Chahar in about three or four days. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song has telegraphed former Civil Affairs Director Wu Yong, Education Director Gao Xibing, and others to return to the province to resume their posts. Guan Linzheng's division of the Central Army, concentrated in Xuanhua, and Wang Jingjiu's division in the Kangzhuang and Xiahuayuan areas will be demobilized soon after the situation in Chahar stabilizes. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang's Allied Army, with sufficient firearms, has a total of over 40,000 troops, currently stationed in Zhangbei, Shangdu, and Wanquan counties. In addition, there are various volunteer armies, totaling no less than 60,000 troops. Among these troops, approximately 20,000 have been inspected by the Military Council. Because the current situation is extremely difficult to handle, Song has ordered all troops to temporarily remain in their current defensive positions and await the Military Council's disposal. Song has also invited Sun Liangcheng and Fang Zhenwu to Zhangjiakou for a meeting. A meeting is scheduled to be held in Zhangjiakou this afternoon for consultations. The Chahar Province area has been impoverished by the stationing of tens of thousands of troops. Xuanhua County alone has provided supplies of no less than 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. The financial situation will become increasingly difficult in the future. Feng's Allied Army headquarters was dissolved on the 9th, and Tong Linge has resumed the title of Zhangjiakou Garrison Commander. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Zhangjiakou, Feng Yuxiang has decided to return to Mount Tai in Shandong to pursue a life of reading. He will take a special train south on the evening of the 13th and is scheduled to pass through Beiping with Song Zheyuan on the 14th, heading to Jinan. (United telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Xunyang Telegram: Yu Xuezhong arrived in Xunyang at noon on the 13th, then took a car to Lotus Cave, transferred to a sedan chair to ascend the mountain, and met with Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei in Guling to discuss important matters. (Central News Agency telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yu Xuezhong said: 1. The takeover of the war zone inside the Great Wall can be completed in three or four days. The counties outside the Great Wall, such as Linyu, are not yet discussed. Banditry is rampant in the counties taken over within the Great Wall, and methods are being devised to eliminate it. The opening of traffic on the Pingyu Railway will be realized soon. 2. For disaster relief in the war zone, the central government has already allocated 1 million yuan in cash and 4 million yuan in public bonds, which will continue to be issued. However, the disaster is severe and the funds are meager, which is of little practical help. 3. Zheng Guilin's troops, after rebelling in Machang, have fled to Chahar. Li Jichun is reorganizing Tibetan affairs and stationed in the four counties of Tangshan. Shi Yousan's troops are also being reorganized. 4. The Chahar issue has been resolved peacefully, but whether Feng Yuxiang has left Zhangjiakou or not is still unknown. 5. This trip was made at the invitation of Jiang Jieshi to report on the situation in North China and to request instructions. There will probably be no formal meeting. Yesterday, when I crossed the Yellow River, I saw that the bridge was submerged by high water, but the damage was minimal and traffic can be restored within a few days. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong arrived in Guling on the morning of the 13th and immediately met with Wang Jingwei to report on important matters. He is scheduled to meet with Jiang Jieshi on the 14th. Li Liejun arrived in Guling and has met with Jiang twice. The discussion on the issue of Feng Yuxiang's future is particularly detailed. It is rumored that Jiang, Wang, Huang, and Li will make concrete arrangements on the 14th regarding the post-war issues in Chahar Province and the situation in North China.

He himself is inspecting the railway affairs along the line and will stay in Yu for two or three days before returning. The last train of the pseudo-Taishan returned to Yu at 10 PM. The Kwantung Army's Tangshan Beining Line District Headquarters was abolished. Gao Zhida rode this train to Yu. The Tangshan Yu line affairs on the pseudo-Taishan side have all been completed. The Tangshan station staff all retreated to Yu by train. All stations were removed station by station and returned to our side. In addition, the Zunhua County Magistrate went to Tangshan on the morning of the 12th to take over. (Special telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Traffic news: In the area of Southern Hebei and Eastern Henan, the Yellow River has breached its banks for several consecutive days, flooding the coast. The number of people submerged has reached 50,000. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The provincial governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Disaster Relief Committee, reporting on the Yellow River flood and requesting the issuance of emergency relief and rescue funds. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to railway news, the Yellow River has again breached its banks north of the Wenxian breach in Henan Province, and the water is flooding north, reducing the source of water in Eastern Henan. The Commissioner's Office of the Twelfth District has also received written reports from Xiao and Dang counties, reporting that the southward-flowing water of the Yellow River in Eastern Henan has entered the Liu River through Yejigang in Minquan and flowed south along the Henan River into Western Anhui. The Xuzhou area is expected to escape danger. The water situation in the old course of the Yellow River in Dangyi is as before. Embankment repairs are still underway here. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The overflowing Yellow River in Henan Province has broken through its embankments and is a vast expanse of water. Rescue boats carried thousands of people, who were all submerged by the water, a very tragic sight. Currently, over two hundred li from Guangwu in the south to Gongxian in the west in the province have become a marsh. Four-fifths of the residents have been submerged, and the property loss is incalculable. (Central News Agency telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yuanzhai area in Kaocheng County, Henan Province, on the south bank of the Yellow River, breached its banks again on the evening of the 11th, with a very large flow of water, directly flooding Kaocheng. Cao County and Shan County in this province will both be flooded. The Hanling River Bureau is trying to prevent it and has telegraphed Shan and other counties to prepare early to prevent the breach water from coming east. Today, the upstream of the Yellow River in this province has dropped by 9.8 inches due to the breaches in Hebei and Henan, so there is no cause for concern.

(Special telegram, 13th) (Xuzhou) The Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from Liu Zhiyi stating that the Yellow River has breached its banks and flooded, requesting early prevention. Zeng Wanzhong has forwarded the order to Administrative Commissioner Yu Nianci for proper prevention. (Special telegram, 13th) (Beiping) The Yellow River Railway Bridge is ten li long, and the insurance period is twelve years. The insurance period expired in 1920. According to German engineers, rebuilding a new bridge would cost more than 26 million yuan. The bid for repairing the old bridge by Belgians was 6.8 million yuan. Due to constant political changes and excessive funding needs, the work was interrupted. This time, the flood is everywhere, and the water is level with the bridge. The first to twenty-ninth holes have been filled with mud, and the piers of the seventy-seventh to seventy-eighth holes have tilted eastward by six degrees, which is extremely serious. Walking and driving on the bridge are dangerous. Passengers traveling south to Xinxiang yesterday and the day before yesterday have all returned. The Railway Bureau is suffering huge losses every day and is now transporting large stones to fill and protect the bridge piers. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior Prepares... Measures to Stabilize Rural Order</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Rural Reconstruction Committee has compiled a book on the Rural Reconstruction Plan, requesting that a large portion of the US cotton and wheat loan be used for rural reconstruction, and plans to convene the last meeting for detailed discussion. The Executive Yuan has expressed its approval in principle and will make a final decision after Song returns to China. (Special telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior believes that the current rural areas are extremely desolate, and the reasons are the harassment of troops, the corruption of officials, the complexity of government orders, and the harshness of taxes. If these problems are not resolved, the rural areas will never be revitalized. Measures to stabilize rural order have been prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which will be selected and implemented in conjunction with the Committee. The outlines are as follows: 1. Regarding military affairs, rectify military discipline, thoroughly review the number of troops, determine military pay, and break the situation of military separatism. 2. Regarding politics, support the people's self-defense, promptly establish special courts and supervisory offices to punish corruption, issue orders to all provinces to establish civil servant disciplinary committees, carefully appoint and strictly reward and punish, and the administrative officials of each province should also be strictly assessed. Corruption by superiors will be punished one degree more severely. On the one hand, government orders should be concentrated, and the division between military orders and government orders should be determined, striving for simplicity and ease of implementation. 3. Regarding taxes, the financial systems of provinces and counties should be clarified, revenue and expenditure should be unified, miscellaneous taxes should be eliminated as much as possible, and extravagance should be strictly prohibited. 4. Regarding rural areas, the rural cooperative business should be promoted, rural investment should be encouraged, farmers' banks should be established separately, specialized talents should be selected, and rural construction should be supported.

<h3 id="e26">The Yellow River Flood Disaster <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>For half a month, the Yellow River flood disaster has become increasingly serious. At the end of July, the waters in various parts of Shaanxi province rose simultaneously due to subterranean surges. The Jing and Wei Rivers destroyed their channels, and there were also reports of flash floods in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Although a disaster occurred in Shaanxi, the scope was not very large. However, at the beginning of August, the water levels in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River increased. At that time, in Changyuan, Hebei province, because troops were suppressing bandits, the bandits secretly destroyed two sections of the river embankment, flooding the rural villages, creating a quite tragic disaster. Extending to Shandong province, the area of terror gradually widened. Recently, in counties such as Xixi and Ciwen in western Henan, the Yellow River waters have overflowed their channels, and the Rongze River has overflowed its banks, reaching Zhengzhou. The floodwaters are heading east, threatening Kaifeng and tending to enter the silted Yellow River. Lanfeng has already been affected. To the north, Lisheng Village in Shandong, and to the east, the northwestern counties of Jiangsu, all face an untenable situation. The threat of the flood disaster has now reached four or five provinces. It is not just a report of disaster in the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Those who discuss the water conservancy of the Yellow River say that since the thirteenth year of the Guangxu reign of the previous Qing Dynasty (1887), the river channel has been stable for more than forty years, and there has been no news of flooding, showing a trend toward becoming more standardized. The Yellow River's surface is higher than the flatlands on both sides, and the severity of its floods is well-known both domestically and abroad. Even within the 267 years of the Qing Dynasty, there were 39 breaches. Before the thirteenth year of Guangxu, there was a flood disaster on average every six years. The reason why there has been no news of flooding in the nearly forty years since then, according to water conservancy experts, is due to the Yangwu Dike and the bridge protection dams of the Pinghan Railway, which have gradually guided the river into a proper course, and the stone protecting the cliffs along the banks, which has gradually strengthened the riverbanks. However, the biggest reason is that in the tributaries and river basins of western Henan, more and more people are diverting river water for irrigation, with crisscrossing channels, enough to reduce the flow of the Yellow River. The wasteland in the upper reaches has been cultivated year by year, so that most of the rainwater does not enter the Yellow River but is absorbed by the newly cultivated land first. However, this diversion of water for irrigation and the absorption of water by cultivated land were not done intentionally for water conservancy purposes. Therefore, they cannot fundamentally eliminate the water damage of the Yellow River. Moreover, from Rongze eastward, the degree to which the riverbed is higher than the flat ground gradually increases. Near Lanfeng, the land gradually becomes higher than the river. But within this large segment, we have not heard of any water conservancy projects that would have been of any benefit. However, considering the indirect ability of opening channels and cultivating wasteland in western Henan and the upper reaches to reduce the damage from the Yellow River floods, amidst this terror of the flood disaster, we cannot help but hope that the officials of the provinces in the Yellow River basin will, on the one hand, strive to encourage the development of this undertaking to increase its effectiveness in preventing disasters, and, on the other hand, supervise and encourage local people in those counties where this undertaking has not yet been carried out to rise up and start it. In this way, the number of channels will increase day by day, the power of the Yellow River can be reduced, and the ground that absorbs water will gradually increase, so that the river water can be prevented from bursting its banks and causing harm.</p>
<p>In the midst of the previous terror of the Yangtze River flood disaster, we exhausted our voices in appealing on behalf of the people of the provinces along the river. Fortunately, the river water gradually receded, and a major disaster was avoided. In recent days, the central water conservancy agencies and the authorities of various provinces have gathered to discuss disaster prevention and relief, and to carry out emergency work. The old events are repeating themselves, and they are extremely busy. It seems unnecessary for us to repeat the old articles. We only hope that after fortunately avoiding a major disaster, we will engage in fundamental water conservancy projects.</p>

<p>Martial Law Declared in the Capital, All Efforts to Restore Order</p>
<p>Machado Flees to the Bahamas</p>
<p>The era of terror in Havana, Cuba has come to an end. The new leader, Cespedes, having been recommended by Congress, will take office as provisional president tonight. His first act after taking office will be to declare martial law so that the military can take appropriate measures to restore order. Next, he will call on the people to be calm, abide by the law, and return to work. Cespedes comes from a prominent family and is unanimously supported by the Liberal Party (i.e., the ruling party that supported the old President Machado) and various revolutionary parties, and has received the informal endorsement of the U.S. government. According to news from the provinces, he is also supported by the rural areas. At a time when the whole country is looking forward to governance, it is expected that he will be able to reform and innovate, wash away the violent rule, and revive the people's livelihood. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Today, the Cuban fortress in Havana fired a 21-gun salute, indicating that the Cuban army supports the election of Dr. Cespedes, the Minister of Education, as provisional president to succeed Machado. All political parties have also expressed their agreement. The authorities are now working hard to restore security and order in the capital. Machado's property is now heavily guarded. This morning, the General Staff ordered the army to occupy Havana and send troops to patrol the streets, stopping any actions that disturb public order. Machado has fled by plane to Nassau, Bahamas.

<p>Earlier this morning, Machado, having been informed that the public's mood was turbulent and difficult to control, and fearing that it would be unfavorable to him, was advised by military leader De Cedas to go to his villa outside the capital for temporary refuge. Machado agreed and signed an order appointing Herrera, the chief of the army and navy, as provisional executive, but stipulated that Herrera should appoint Cespedes as Secretary of State, because according to the Cuban constitution, when the president dies or leaves office, the Secretary of State automatically becomes provisional president. De Cedas then prepared an armored car and sent heavy troops to protect and carry Machado to his villa outside the city, and then hired a plane to leave the capital. It is said that the police chief and the mayor of Havana accompanied him. According to unconfirmed news, Machado's plane landed on an island in the Bahamas, where a house had been prepared in advance. Herrera, after Machado left the capital, immediately went to the U.S. embassy to attend a meeting of various factions, and they agreed to elect Cespedes as provisional president. Congress will meet tonight under heavy guard to pass a resolution accepting Machado's resignation and supporting Cespedes as the new head of state. (</p>

<p>Havana The situation here is rather strange. It is generally believed that former President Menocal, the leader of the revolutionary party who is likely to be elected president, is still in Miami, USA, with his advisors and has not returned to the country. However, considering that Menocal did not send representatives to participate in the negotiations previously mediated by U.S. Ambassador Welles, it seems that he is no longer at the center of the situation. Colonel Alvarez, who is currently leading the revolutionary army in the area between the provinces of Oriente and Santa Clara, has been invited to the capital to jointly select cabinet members. Alvarez has been fighting the Machado government's army for more than a year, and his troops are well-equipped. He is also the first to contribute to the revolution. At this time, those who have the right to speak on cabinet formation include the leaders of various revolutionary parties. The parties currently in the capital include the Nationalist Party, the Student Party, and the ABC Party. The ABC Party is a secret organization that specializes in dealing with Machado's secret police and implementing a reciprocal plan of terrorism. (National Telegram, 12th) Night of Terror</p>

<p>Havana Yesterday and this morning were unusually chaotic, with frequent incidents, resulting in a total of twenty-one deaths and more than two hundred injuries. The military and police were unable to maintain order. The private residences of Machado and his associates were destroyed by rioters after the owners fled. Utensils were thrown into the streets, and valuables and clothing were looted. Government offices and government-run newspapers were also destroyed. The rioters then went to the presidential palace. During the disturbance, at least five plainclothes police officers were killed. The naval and army soldiers stationed at the palace wanted to suppress the riots, but were unable to do so. The flowers and trees in the palace were completely destroyed. According to the opinions of the general public, the collapse of the Machado government is now being appropriately celebrated. There have been recent reports that Havana Mayor Dr. Izquierdo was killed, but this has not yet been confirmed. Colonel Jiménez, the chief of secret detectives, shot and wounded a demonstrator while the public was fervently celebrating Machado's abdication. Soldiers, seeing this and feeling indignant, shot and killed Jiménez. Transportation between the capital and the interior is now blocked. (</p>

At the same time, they are searching for and killing the secret police of the old president's era. Twelve people, including the chief of the secret police, have been arrested and killed, and their corpses are abandoned on the streets for all to despise. All those who held key positions in the Machado government are hiding and dare not come out. Even Herrera is hiding and has not been able to participate in the handover of administrative power to Cespedes. As for where he is hiding, it is expected to be in the U.S. embassy.

<p>Rumors Say He Was Poisoned with Arsenic</p>
<p>Staff Officer Sakata Died Before Wu Teng</p>
<p>Regarding the death of Wu Teng Xinyi, the former commander of the Kwantung Army and army general, on July 27, there are still many rumors about the cause of his death. Although the Japanese side has denied assassination, the Japanese here also believe that his death was not due to a normal illness. It is rumored that General Wu Teng was attacked by assassins in a car, or that he was injured by a landmine, or that a bomb was thrown. According to what was conveyed by his confidential staff, these rumors are not true. In fact, on the train from Dalian back to Changchun, arsenic was hidden in Wu Teng's food. Wu Teng and his staff officer, Colonel Sakata, were poisoned at the same time after eating it. However, Staff Officer Sakata was poisoned too severely. When the train arrived in Changchun, he died at his home shortly after. Wu Teng's poisoning was less severe, and he was treated by a doctor for detoxification, which extended his life for a few more days. In the end, he also died. After the death of Staff Officer Sakata, the Kwantung Army kept it secret. Three days after General Wu Teng's death, they announced the wrongful death of Staff Officer Sakata. Also, in Wu Teng's will, he mentioned that disputes among his subordinates were detrimental to the future governance of Manchuria and instructed the army to find a way to resolve this dispute, which shows the complexity of Wu Teng's cause of death.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the sentencing of the perpetrators of the May 15th Incident, representatives from the Army, Navy, and Justice Ministries held a joint meeting on the 11th to discuss and determine a unified sentencing request. It is said that it has been decided to impose the death penalty on the ringleaders. The lawyers for the naval perpetrators held a meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. There was unanimous opposition to severe penalties, and it was decided to send representatives to visit Navy Minister Osumi and Army Minister Araki to plead for lenient punishment. Fascist groups are also holding meetings one after another, planning to take this opportunity to launch a nationwide campaign to save lives, using this topic to create a movement to overthrow party politics and support military dictatorship. However, the Japanese Police Security Bureau has issued orders nationwide to prevent this type of movement. (Hualian News Agency, 13th)</p>

<p>Twenty-Three Planes Land in Ostia</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Embraces Balbo</p>
<p>Guilan Leaves Paved Along the Triumphal Arch, Women Contend to Offer Flowers</p>
<p>The Italian King Receives the Pilots in the Palace and Extends His Condolences</p>
<p>▲National, Rome, 12th An Italian air minister, Balbo, and his Atlantic crossing flight team arrived safely in Ostia at 8:30 tonight amidst thunderous cheers. Fifteen minutes later, the first nine aircraft had landed safely in succession. Balbo decided to send each aircraft to the airstrip across from Rome at Lido di Roma due to the late hour. Approximately ten minutes later, Balbo landed, and Prime Minister Mussolini immediately stepped forward to greet and embrace him. The people chanted the Giovinezza in unison, and the flight team's aircraft arrived at their destination in succession at this time.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rome, 12th General Balbo led his flight team to Ostia at 6:38 this evening. General Balbo's black aircraft led the way, followed closely by the other twenty-two aircraft. When the flight team appeared in the sky, millions of people cheered loudly, resounding through the sky. The military band then played the Fascist Party music. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini rushed to the place where the aircraft were parked and embraced General Balbo. Onlookers shouted, [Long live Balbo!] [Long live Mussolini!] General Balbo's wife led her three children to the field. When she kissed her husband, she was overwhelmed with joy and tears. When each pilot landed, the crowd cheered again, and General Balbo introduced the team members to the Prime Minister one by one. The team members then boarded twenty-four cars and headed for Rome. Mussolini and Balbo rode in the same car in front, followed by a hundred Fascist Party members on motorcycles in front of the car and a team of mounted police behind the car. At the time of departure, the public was ecstatic and reached the extreme. The procession arrived at the Palazzo Colonna, where the team members were again warmly welcomed. General Balbo responded to the welcoming speech by saying, [We are merely the small soldiers of the great commander!] Twenty-two aircraft were unable to first circle Rome due to bad weather, and landed at Ostia.</p>
<p>▲National, Rome, 13th The triumphant return of General Balbo's flight team yesterday was welcomed by the country in a grand occasion, second only to the triumph of the great General Caesar in ancient times. Near 6 PM, the aircraft appeared on the horizon, densely approaching the coast. At that time, more than one hundred thousand welcomers who had waited all day cheered thunderously. The last batch of aircraft in the team landed on the water at 7:15. This round trip crossed the Atlantic twice, leaving the country for forty-two days and flying twelve thousand five hundred miles. General Balbo was the first to land on the right side of the Grand Tribune at 6:20. He left the aircraft, wore the Fascist black shirt, approached Prime Minister Mussolini, and saluted and paid tribute to Mussolini and the crowd. The crowd shouted Long Live Balbo. A bridge was specially built on the waterfront, covered with flowers, for Balbo to walk on to land, but Balbo declined to enjoy this extravagant honor and jumped ashore from the wing of his aircraft. His wife, holding two young daughters, was also present at the time. The two young daughters kept shouting [Daddy]. At this time, the band played the national music. Mussolini stepped forward and embraced and kissed Balbo, which was the most enthusiastic salute in Italy. Mussolini then met with the team members one by one. Then, thousands of cars followed the team members to Rome. General Balbo gave a short speech at the Palazzo Colonna, thanking the people of the country, but his words were drowned out by cheers.</p>

<p>▲Havas News Agency, Rome, 13th This morning, the Italian air fleet led by General Balbo was warmly welcomed by all sectors of society, no different from a triumphant return. The Italian king received the flight team members in the palace. They entered through the Arch of Constantine. No one has received this honor since 1527. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini awarded Air Minister Balbo the title of Air Force General. From 8 AM this morning, Fascist Party troops were stationed at the palace. The Italian King spoke with each pilot in his uniform for half an hour, and then led them to stand on the balcony. The crowd cheered wildly. The pilots then lined up to Piazza Navona. The streets were covered with laurel leaves. The wives and mothers of all the pilots who had previously died in the line of duty went to the Bonas Temple to present flowers to General Balbo. In front of the ancient Roman Theater, young Fascist Party members raised iron spears and crossed them to form a passage. The pilots passed under it. Officials were waiting in front of the Triumphal Arch. Noblewomen and ladies competed to offer flowers to General Balbo. Salutes were fired everywhere, and the troops saluted with their guns. Each pilot gathered on the Palatine Hill. At 10:30, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini arrived, wearing the uniform of the Party Army. General Balbo introduced the pilots one by one and said, [The reward we hope for in serving you is to be able to be driven and serve you one day]. The Italian Prime Minister said that the pilots had brought glory to the country, the Italian revolution, and aviation. What you have accomplished in this flight will not be seen again in several years. The Italian Prime Minister then kissed General Balbo and announced the Italian King's edict awarding Balbo the title of Air Force General. He also pinned a gold eagle on Balbo's chest. After the Italian Prime Minister announced the promotion edicts of each pilot, they all saluted the national flag and dispersed.</p>

<p>The Government Party Defeats the Blue Shirt Party</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Dublin, 12th The first round of the fight between Southern Ireland's Free Party leader Eamon de Valera and the Blue Shirt Party has gone to de Valera. After the order banning the Blue Shirt march was issued this morning, General O'Duffy decided to cancel Sunday's march, but set it for August 20 in churches everywhere. It is said that only relatives of the dead and some members of Parliament will participate in the ceremonies commemorating the leaders who died during the revolution tomorrow. Cosgrave Party members have decided not to join, because according to Cosgrave, it would be meaningless if the public were not allowed to participate in this grand public ceremony expressing admiration and gratitude for the great men who restored Ireland.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Dublin, 12th Southern Ireland's conservatives believe that de Valera's dictatorial system will definitely not last until next year. However, for some time now, members of the British House of Commons have occasionally raised questions, accusing de Valera of his secessionist tactics, but the British government has remained silent and has not responded. Also, news that negotiations between Britain and Ireland are underway has not been officially denied. Therefore, the impression of the conservatives in Southern Ireland seems to be only a kind of wish and must be treated with caution.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Dublin, 11th Hundreds of police officers were stationed in the main areas of the capital of Southern Ireland, and militias and two armored vehicles patrolled the streets. The military has been ordered to prepare for riots. The morning was very quiet. After the clock struck twelve, six members of General O'Duffy's Blue Shirt team, wearing uniforms but unarmed, walked out of the office and headed for O'Connell Street. Then, a crowd attacked them. The Blue Shirt team members defended themselves with their fists. The disparity between the two sides was so great that they were almost in danger. Fortunately, the militia arrived and drove the crowd back with batons, escorting the beaten back to the office.</p>

After the reorganization of the Northeast Fleet, it is currently under the command of Xie Gang Zhe. However, after the three ships, including the Haiqi, went south, there are still some officers and men who have not left. How to resettle them is currently under discussion. Out of camaraderie, I cannot ignore them. Regarding the position of Mayor of Qingdao, I still intend to firmly resign. Previously, for the sake of stabilizing public sentiment, I temporarily returned to Qingdao from Weihai, but I have not yet taken office. Now, after the Central Government sends someone to take over, I can hand over the position and will take a long-term rest in a leisurely capacity. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Education is the source of governance and disorder, and rectifying the school atmosphere is the starting point for rectifying education. Currently, education funds can be paid on time, and all arrears have been allocated for supplementary issuance.

<p>(Xi'an) Zhang Nai Gong, a special commissioner for the internal inspection of Gansu and Qinghai, flew from Lanzhou to Xi'an on the 12th. Reporters immediately inquired about the recent political situation in the two provinces. According to him, there is no politics to speak of in Qinghai. Civil administration, finance, justice, and other matters are all controlled by Ma Bufang, a subordinate of the New 9th Division. The central government's laws and decrees are equivalent to empty words, and the burden on the people is extremely heavy, unparalleled in any other province. Although Ma Lin is the chairman, he merely holds the title and cannot restrain Ma Bufang's tyranny. In the past, Gansu's political affairs could not be implemented because military and financial affairs could not be organized. Since Zhu Shaoliang took charge of Gansu, he first started by stabilizing the people's livelihood and reducing the burden on the people, which was quite appropriate. If there are no other obstacles, Gansu's politics can gradually be brought into order. When asked about the opposition to Sun Dianying entering Qinghai, he said that this was entirely Ma Bufang's personal opinion, and the people of all ethnic groups did not have this view. On the 13th, he took a car to Man搭陇海车 and returned to Beijing. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>㈠ Discovery of a "Four-Not-Alike" Before Leaving Japan</p>
<p>On the 25th, the Japanese Man-Mongolian Academic Survey Team boarded the Hong Kong-bound ship in Kobe. Before the ship set sail, the team leader, Dr. Tokunaga, and Secretary Ihara went to the coast of Linzaki Village, west of Akashi, for a stroll. Suddenly, they discovered a valuable fossil of deer footprints on the Akashi coast, which is what is called a "Four-Not-Alike" in ancient Chinese books. These footprints are about 20 meters from the coast, on shale in the sea. There are four continuous prints. Dr. Tokunaga will soon publish a paper on these footprints of the "Four-Not-Alike." It has been found that the area along the coast nearby has been called "Deer Xiang" since ancient times, and fossils such as the teeth and tusks of elephants have often been found. According to Dr. Tokunaga, this is the second time that deer footprints have been discovered in Japan. About 20 years ago, they were discovered once near Hanamaki Onsen in Oshu. However, this is the first time that four footprints have been found in one place. Recently, a horn fossil was also discovered in the same area, which further confirms that it is a "Four-Not-Alike."</p>
<p>㈡ Discovery of New Plants in Lushun</p>

That is, on 203 Highland, they discovered new species of Ai Peng (Artemisia) class, wild grapes, and chrysanthemums, as well as variants of cypress and juniper, obtaining valuable data in the botanical world. These plants were entrusted to Associate Professor Kishida and Professor Mori to make new specimens. At 4:30 PM on the 29th, they left Dalian and went north. On the 30th, they arrived in Fengtian. In addition to visiting various local agencies, they saw 20 stone steles with ancient Khitan characters at the private residence of Tang (the rebellious) Yu Lin, the headquarters of the Independent Garrison. The steles were one foot thick and four feet long and wide. They were originally discovered by the French Minister near Linxi, and after negotiating with Zhang Xueliang, it cost 20,000 yuan in shipping costs to send them to Tang's private residence. At noon on the same day, they collected plants and went to Beiling. At 3:00 PM, they took a car to Changchun. At 9:00 AM on the 31st, the car arrived at Changke Station. On the same day, they held a ceremony to form a team and formed a guard unit. In addition to visiting various agencies, they prepared a plan for the first step of exploration. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they arrived in Jinzhou and collected various reference materials. The structural geologist Kihachi Ihara and Dr. Saburo Shimizu formed the advance team. On the morning of the 4th, they departed from Jinzhou for Beipiao, entering the first gate of Rehe Northeast. The weather was unusually hot that day, with the temperature rising to 36 degrees Celsius. The survey team stayed in four hotels in Beipiao. In the afternoon, they transported food, equipment, and other items to Chifeng and Chengde separately. The 5th was the first day of work for the scientific exploration team. At 9:00 AM, the team members wore uniforms and gathered in front of the Beipiao Railway Station. Dr. Tokunaga gave instructions, saying, "From today, we will begin the scientific survey of Rehe. Each member will use their professional knowledge and give full play to their respective responsibilities in order to achieve distant goals." The team members were divided into classes according to department, with each class assigned six or seven soldiers. Dr. Tokunaga, Shimizu, Ihara, and the heads of each department began to investigate the Beipiao coal mine. Botanists Nakai and Honda entered the nearby mountains for inspection. Zoologists Mori and Kishida, as well as anthropologist Yahata and geographer Tada, all departed for their scheduled locations in succession.</p>
<p>㈢ Harvest in the Wilderness of Beipiao</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 5th, the botany team, Nakai and Honda, carried collection equipment and went to the Wujianfang area. The zoology team, Hayata and Mori, carried insect nets and went to the mountains behind the coal mine. Team leader Tokunaga, Dr. Shimizu, and Mr. Ito specialized in investigating the Beipiao coal mine. Each team had six or seven guards. The geology and botany teams went to the remote area of ​​Yue. The botany team passed Wujianfang along the Beipiao River, exploring the embankments, wetlands, and grasslands along the river, and climbed the extremely high slopes, entering the pine forests and visiting a tribe under the jurisdiction of Old Mongolian King Ente. At this time, they suddenly received a report that a whirlwind was about to rise. For a time, the mountains, rivers, and natural scenery showed a desolate scene. By the evening, each team returned to Beipiao one after another. On this day, the botany team collected about 70 species of wild grasses and trees, including plants that were not seen in mainland Japan. According to Dr. Nakai, the soil near Beipiao is very fertile, and if pine trees are cultivated, they will definitely flourish. The area is deforested due to indiscriminate logging by the villagers, and only four or five plants such as Mongolian willow remain. The zoology team collected about 60 species of insects on this day, including a golden beetle that specializes in eating the feces of cattle and horses on the roadside and lives in holes in the ground. Anthropologist Dr. Yahata excavated many stones and earthenware of the Neolithic Age in the eastern slope of the mountains, and discovered objects related to bronze in Beipiao, all of which are valuable historical materials. In short, on the first day of the exploration work, each team had considerable gains. It is planned to depart for Chaoyang on the 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Yellow River Warning in Bianyuan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Wen County Embankment Overflowed, Turning into a Swamp. The Overflowed Water in Fan County and Rongze Counties is More Than Ten Feet Deep. There is News that the Yellow River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway is About to be Washed Away.</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Has Sent a Large Number of Vehicles to Rescue. The Residents of Kaifeng are Greatly Frightened Upon Hearing the News and are Fleeing in Droves. Lanfeng Has Been Flooded into the Old Riverbed, Very Close to the City.</p>
<p>The Situation in Shaan County is the Worst Flood in Fifty Years. The Hebei Changyuan Breach is Open. The Lu River Affairs Bureau is Preparing to Defend and Block the Flood.</p>
<p>Kaifeng Special News: Bianyuan is very close to the Yellow River, only 18 li from Liuyuan Kou in the north and only 25 li from Heigang Kou in the northwest. The water surface is usually about eight feet higher than the ground in Kaifeng. Once a breach occurs, it is like pouring water into a hole, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, local people are often uneasy in the autumn and summer seasons. This year, the water volume has increased, and warnings have been frequent. On the night of the 8th, the water level in Wen County rose by two meters and one inch, and the dikes along the 6th, 7th, and 8th Forts overflowed for about ten li, turning dozens of square li outside the city into a swamp. As of yesterday, the water had surrounded the city, and the people's houses and property were all washed away. The water flow in Shaan County was 5,374 cubic meters larger than the previous maximum flow, which is the worst flood in fifty years. In Fan County, the dikes overflowed due to the Yellow River, and the water was more than ten feet deep on the ground. Many farmers who were escaping by boat capsized and died. The Ku River in the western end of Rongze has always been an internal flow of the Yellow River, but now, due to the large amount of water in the Yellow River, it has become a reverse flow. The railway tracks on both the north and south banks of the Pinghan Railway Bridge are slightly lower than the bridge body and were submerged by water. Zhengzhou North Thirty is about to become a swamp. The two express trains on the Pinghan Railway have been suspended. For more than a hundred li between the railway bridge and Heigang, many river embankments were submerged and collapsed. The water surface on the south bank is two or three feet away from the levee surface in most places, and three or four inches in some places, which is extremely dangerous. In the evening, Liu Zhi sent ten automobiles and forty large vehicles to transport materials, and dispatched 500 security team members, together with the Public Security Bureau and road workers, to rush to rescue the situation. However, few people in the city knew about it. It was not until the Republic Daily Extra was issued at about 10:00 PM that all entertainment venues were emptied, and the entire city was extremely tense. The number of cars rushing out of the north gate gradually increased, and the telephone of the River Affairs Bureau was constantly ringing. At midnight, the Public Security Bureau notified the citizens to prepare for the worst and sealed the southwest city gate. As a result, the residents were panicked and fled to public places with high-rise buildings. Longting and Henan University were extremely crowded. The sound of cars and the noise of the citizens continued all night. It was recently reported that the water level in Heigang had dropped, but all the projects were damaged. All the dignitaries are inspecting the area and supervising more than 1,500 soldiers and workers to rush to build the area. The situation in Zhengzhou is still extremely urgent. There are reports that the Yellow River Railway Bridge is about to be washed away, and the water in Lanfeng has flooded into the old riverbed, only a hundred steps away from the county seat. (August 11th, 10:00)</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in Changyuan, Hebei, has breached. The River Affairs Bureau is very concerned that if the water is poured into Shandong, the three counties of Hetao Fan County, Yanggu County, and Shou Zhang County in the upper reaches will suffer. In addition to the Director, Zhang Lianjia, personally going to the upper reaches of the Tao Cheng Bu area on the north bank to inspect, he also ordered Pu County on the western border of Shandong to investigate and report the water situation of the breach. Today, according to a telegram from Zhang Guo Zhong, the county magistrate of Pu County, there are two breaches in Jindi Shitou Zhuang and Da Suo Zhuang in Changyuan, one more than 60 zhang wide and one more than ten zhang wide. The river water is now flowing to Weinan Irrigation area in Hua County, Henan, and has not yet flowed to Pu County. The smaller of the two breaches has been plugged, and the larger one is also being repaired. The River Affairs Bureau, in order to prevent all eventualities, is afraid that once the breach water is poured into the border counties, it will suffer losses. It is now ordering the upstream general section to actively transport materials and transfer workers to the north bank in preparation for defense and blockage. It is reported that the breach water is flowing slowly and weakly, and one of the two breaches has been blocked, and the situation has eased. It is probably not enough to cause harm. The upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River have all reported rising water due to continuous rain in recent days. According to the water level report obtained by the River Affairs Bureau this morning, the upper reaches rose more than two inches, the middle reaches rose more than four inches, and the lower reaches rose more than one inch. At noon, the water level was level. The report from Zhang Guo Zhong, the county magistrate of Pu County, on the breach is as follows: [Previously received a telegram stating that Jindi in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, was dug open by bandits in two places. According to investigation, the breaches are in Shitou Zhuang and Da Suo Zhuang, one more than 60 zhang wide and the other more than ten zhang wide. The river water flows out to Weinan Irrigation area in Hua County, Henan Province. Fortunately, it has not flowed to Pu County. The current Yellow River water level is dropping, and the dikes are exposed. The one that was more than ten zhang wide has been completed, and the one that is more than 60 zhang wide is still being repaired. I respectfully report this] (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Song Zhe Yuan Reorganizes and Disbands the Armies in Chahar Province <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>│North China Armies Are Also Being Reorganized│</p>
<p>Peiping Special News: The Chahar affair has been largely resolved, but the aftermath is complicated and quite difficult. Regarding the disposition of the troops, it was decided to proceed in accordance with the guidelines agreed upon at the military sub-conference. All righteous volunteer armies such as those of Li Zhongyi, Liu Zhen Dong, and the old troops of Deng Wen, etc., will be verified and reorganized by the military sub-conference. The two troops of Zhang Renjie and Bao Gang of Fang Zhen Wu's command will be directly reorganized by the military sub-conference. Fang's newly recruited troops will be reorganized and disbanded according to the situation. Feng's newly编部队 are placed under 宋哲元 to assess their actual strength and military discipline, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and proceed with reorganization and disbandment. Liu Gui Tang's troops are quite numerous and have close ties with the puppet state. The military sub-conference has decided not to recognize them. However, because this unit is stationed in eastern Chahar, and borders the Rehe border, both appeasement and suppression are inconvenient. Therefore, we are planning to develop a perfect way to handle it.</p>
<p>The Chahar provincial government has decided to add to the reorganization. Qin De Chun is internally designated as the Director of Civil Affairs. Guo Zhihan is internally designated as the Director of Finance. Zhang Ji Yong will be the Director of Education. Song Zhe Yuan previously recommended Pang Bing Xun for the position of chairman, but it did not materialize. Later, Pang's troops entered Chahar and had a great relationship with resolving the Chahar affair. Song, for the sake of maintaining friendship, and because he personally had an emotional relationship with Feng and his subordinates, felt that handling the aftermath would be difficult. Therefore, he telegraphed the central government to let Pang take over the position himself. However, in the current Chahar situation, it is difficult for all parties to let Song step down. Moreover, it is even more difficult for Pang to take on the responsibility of cleaning up the Chahar situation in his position. Therefore, it is difficult for Song to break free, while Pang will still serve as the commander of bandit suppression in Chahar Province.</p>
<p>The military and political affairs of North China are extremely complicated. The monthly military expenditure was originally more than seven million, but after He Ying Qin came north to preside over the situation, he tried his best to reduce it. Now it still requires more than five million per month. Since the outbreak of the war, the income of North China has decreased sharply, and the difference between income and expenditure is even greater. If no measures are taken to reorganize, it will be difficult to sustain. It is reported that Huang Shao Xiong recently came north and has had detailed discussions with He Ying Qin and others. It has been decided to implement reorganization starting next month, starting with verification to ensure that names match reality so that the monthly salary is appropriate for the budget. However, the reorganization of the North China armies is most difficult for the Northeast Army. After the war, all Northeast armies expanded their organizations, changed regiments to divisions. The situation was chaotic after the war, and there were many discrepancies between names and reality. It is impossible to let it go naturally. If reorganization is started, it is feared that complications will arise, which is also expected to be a major challenge. (August 12th Delivered)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Jiang's Order to Provincial and County Magistrates in Bandit Suppression: Their Survival is Tied to the City's <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>No Embellishment, Complacency, Evasion of Responsibility Allowed; Those Who Can Defend But Fail To Will Face the Ultimate Penalty</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram ordering all county magistrates in the bandit suppression provinces and districts to strive for vigorous efforts and to be determined to live or die with the city. Those who can defend but fail to do so will be treated as being cowardly in the face of battle and will be sentenced to the ultimate penalty. The original text is as follows: [Now is the time when the military operations of bandit suppression are being intensified. Regarding the elimination of local hidden dangers, the reconstruction of the bandit areas, and the assistance to military actions, all require the improvement of political efficiency. The implementation of general politics starts and ends at the county level. Therefore, the responsibility of the county magistrate is the most significant. Recently, it has been found that although there are not many county magistrates who are greedy and derelict in their duties, most of them excel at embellishment and consider complacency to be a good strategy. They evade responsibility and create a false appearance. Those who are clean, self-disciplined, and genuinely committed to their duties are often rigid and stick to the letter of the law, only concerned with completing the formalities of government orders but not seeking actual results. As a result, human and financial resources are wasted. For example, blockhouses are often built near the county seat but not in the villages; militia are only trained to assemble mechanically but are not asked if they can perform patrols and searches, or other bandit suppression tasks. Such examples are too numerous to list. It must be understood that the higher-level government can only indicate the objectives and principles of a policy. The steps of implementation, the speed of progress, depend on whether the county magistrate can understand the local conditions and adapt to the circumstances, and use the policy appropriately. What is even more regrettable is that we are lamenting the decline of the national spirit and thinking of ways to encourage and revitalize it. As a county magistrate, one should have the determination to serve the country and go to death, and to consider it shameful to seek safety in the face of danger. Since the rise of bandit suppression military operations, soldiers at the front lines have been dying in battle. However, most county magistrates either flee at the first sign of alarm or run away as soon as the bandits arrive. Those who can live or die with the city are as rare as phoenixes. Righteousness has disappeared and integrity is lost. How can the people stand when facing such officials? This must be rectified to change the atmosphere. Since last year, I, the Chairman, have been responsible for supervising the suppression, and have announced that the principle of "70% politics and 30% military" should be widely understood. Now, in order to improve political efficiency, I make an agreement with the county magistrates: From now on, each of you must deeply regret your past mistakes, strive for vigorous efforts, and completely abandon the bad habits of embellishment, complacency, superficial compliance, and secret resistance. All the things that should be done or reformed should be promoted practically, quickly, and resolutely, in the most economical and effective way. If a county is attacked by bandits and has sufficient regular self-defense forces, the magistrate must be responsible for defending to the death, awaiting the arrival of reinforcements. Otherwise, it will be treated as being cowardly in the face of battle and will be sentenced to the ultimate penalty. The district administrative commissioners are responsible for supervision. The quality of county administration and the bravery of the magistrates are their joint responsibility. The provincial government should provide proper guidance and strict supervision, and enforce the law without leniency. If the commanders-in-chief of each route and the general commanders have the authority to handle local party and government affairs, they are expected to be genuinely responsible within their respective jurisdictions and to supervise and encourage them strictly.] (August 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e69">Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei Send Troops to Jointly Suppress He Long <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>│Bandits in the Border Areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Are Also Gradually Being Eliminated│</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: He Long's remnant bandits, having fled from Woniuping in Xuan'en through Yexiongguan in Laifeng, have infiltrated into Hunan. The remaining forces in Hubei have been completely eliminated. Xu Yuanquan, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the Hunan-Hubei Border Area, in order to thoroughly eliminate these bandits, has established a specific three-sided encirclement plan, ordering Zhang Gang's entire force to be the vanguard of the pursuit, advancing towards Longshan in Hunan. Simultaneously, he telegraphed He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the West Route, and Liu Xiang, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, requesting them to send troops to block the bandits, without regard to jurisdictional boundaries, until the bandits are completely eliminated. After receiving the telegram, He Jian immediately dispatched the forces of Gong Yu and Jie from Yongshun and Sangzhi. Liu Xiang also ordered the troops stationed in the area of Youyang and Xiushan in Lower Eastern Sichuan to maintain strict vigilance along the east of the Youshui River. The troops of the three provinces were simultaneously mobilized a few days ago and have now established contact, encircling the bandits several times over. When He Long's bandits were in Western Hubei, they suffered heavy losses. Their strength was greatly diminished. This time, they urgently fled to Hunan and were pursued along the way. Although they eventually broke through the encirclement, their numbers are only one or two thousand. Using these forces to resist the armies of three provinces is like trying to stop a chariot with an arm. A week ago, Xu Yuanquan telegraphed Hankou, saying that the bandits' momentum was exhausted and that they were now in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>The remnant bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui are also gradually being eliminated. According to He Yaozu, the effectiveness of the military efforts has now been fully achieved. Although the remaining bandits claim to be the 25th and 28th Armies, they are just a motley crew. They have no more than three or four thousand guns. For example, the fake 25th Army has two divisions with about two thousand guns, and the fake 28th Army has only one division with about one thousand guns. The remaining guerrilla detachments and independent regiments have fewer than several hundred guns in total. More than 1,500 guns have been successively seized by the troops of Liang Guanying and others. The remaining forces are actually very few. Therefore, the bandits have reduced the two armies and three divisions into four fake divisions. They are now being blockaded and surrounded by the National Army and will soon be eradicated. He also talked about the post-banditry efforts in the bandit areas. To attract the refugees, the first step is to build roads to facilitate transportation so that the people can easily return to their villages. Temporary houses will also be built in the important villages to provide shelter for the returning people. At the same time, farming cattle and tools will be purchased and loaned to the farmers to enable them to engage in production. Then, the people's armed forces will be expanded to increase their self-defense capabilities. This approach will be implemented in both the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area and the Hunan-Hubei border area. (12th)</p>

<p>Cai Tingkai Supervises the Suppression in Longyan, Guangdong Troops Increase Deployment Towards Shanghang</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: After the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army repeatedly searched for the remnant bandits, the Jiangxi Communists, finding that it was not easy to advance south, changed their plan and invaded Western Fujian from Eastern Jiangxi. At the beginning of this month, the bandits set out in three groups. The left route attacked Qingliu from Tai'ning and Ninghua, the right route attacked Xinquan from Nanyang, and the central route was the main force. The bandits, including the fake 12th Army and Peng Dehuai's 3rd Army Corps, numbered about 20,000, and launched a full-scale attack on Liancheng from Changting, hoping to go down to Longyan via Liancheng and Xinquan in order to contain the Fujian and Guangdong Bandit Suppression Armies. When the three routes launched their surprise attacks, Liancheng on the central route bore the brunt. At that time, the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, commanded by Qu Shounian, was stationed in Liancheng with a strength of two regiments. The bandits attacked with several times their strength and were immediately met with a heavy blow. Later, for strategic reasons, Liancheng was abandoned. The Qu Division joined the 60th Division commanded by Shen Guanghan and the 61st Division commanded by Mao Weishou, and firmly defended Longyan to thwart the bandits' momentum. Cai Tingkai also personally went to Longyan on the 5th and, after holding a military conference, ordered the troops to advance towards Liancheng and Changting in separate routes. Shanghang is also a military stronghold. Cai also transferred the 49th Division commanded by Zhang Yan to support Xinquan. The Zhang Division immediately dispatched two regiments to Lianjiang. At the same time, he also telegraphed Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province, requesting him to transfer the East River troops to garrison the Fujian border and jointly carry out the operation. After receiving the telegram, Chen ordered the 1st Independent Division commanded by Huang Renhuan to increase its defense of Shanghang in the immediate vicinity. Huang's division was ordered to increase the deployment of the 2nd Brigade commanded by Yan Yingyu to Western Fujian, and transferred a regiment of the 7th Division commanded by Huang Yanzhen stationed in Pingyuan to Jiaoling to take over the defense. Huang Renhuan himself recently returned from Pingyuan to Jiaoling to plan the bandit suppression military affairs in Western Fujian. As for the 1st Brigade commanded by Zeng Youren, originally stationed in Shanghang, it was deployed in Changjiang, Baisha, Fengshi, and Shanghang County to strengthen the defenses. All officers and soldiers are not allowed to leave the camp day and night. The people have moved away at the news, and now almost no one lives in Baisha, Banji, Jiangjunqiao, Shanghang, and Yongding, turning them into a desolate world. Also, on the 2nd of this month (according to reconnaissance reports, a large number of Red bandits suddenly appeared in Yixi Bandit Area on the border of Changjiang. Zeng Youren's brigade immediately advanced towards the bandit area in three routes. The bandits also stubbornly resisted on three sides. After a fierce battle for about an hour, a part of the bandits, about a hundred people, broke out from the northwest, intending to divide Zeng's brigade's forces. Zeng's brigade sent a machine gun company to block them. The bandits failed and fled to the mountains near Luoxuan Jiangjunmiao. The battle lasted sixteen hours, and it was estimated that more than 500 bandits were killed and more than 20 were captured. More than a dozen guns and cannons were seized. After the bandits retreated, the rice crops there had been reaped and plundered by the bandits. On the 6th, Ye Weihao's regiment of Zeng's brigade continued to report that on the morning of the 5th, the bandits reassembled 800 people and attempted to attack our front. The entire army was immediately dispatched to suppress the bandits. Their way back was blocked by our army, and they fled east and west. More than 200 bandits were wounded and killed, and the fake independent regimental commander Wei Chengmin and the fake battalion commander He Beguang, and thirteen male and female Communists were captured. The remaining bandits fled to the mountains in the southeast. The Guangdong army, considering that the banditry in the Shanghang area had not been quelled, ordered the entire 1st Independent Division to consolidate the Shanghang line, and transferred the 2nd Independent Division commanded by Zhang Ruigui from Chaozhou and Shantou to Meixian as a reserve force, in order to liaise with the 19th Route Army to attack Changting.

<h3 id="e74">Shandong Provincial Library Acquires Three Rare Treasures <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>To Endure Like the Ming Lake in Fushan</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: Wang Xiantang, the Director of the Shandong Provincial Library, has extensive knowledge and keen discernment of bronze and stone antiquities. In recent years, he has collected rare books and antiquities, and his collection is rich and extensive. Recently, he has acquired several more kinds, which are especially rare treasures. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e75">Han Dynasty Cai Yong's One-Character Stone Classics <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>There are many Han Dynasty steles on the market, but very few have signatures. Only the One-Character Stone Classics, written by Cai Yong, is clearly proven. The Book of the Later Han states: [At that time, those who came to Luoyang Imperial Academy to copy it filled thousands of vehicles every day]. It can be seen how precious it was. Later, due to the long years and changes in the landscape, the stone carvings were buried underground, and very few were unearthed. In the early Qing Dynasty, Huang Xiaocun obtained a rubbing, which was the Three-Character Stone Classics from the Cao Wei Dynasty, and treasured it like a precious jade. Since the Republic of China, a certain Ding from Huang County obtained a piece of the Three-Character Stone Classics, which he also kept secretly and did not show to others. However, the One-Character Stone Classics written by Cai Yong has never been found. In 1917, the One-Character Stone Classics was unearthed. The Peking Library and Peking University each obtained a piece, with an area of ​​only one square foot, but the price was three or four thousand taels of gold. Later, Yu Youren obtained a piece for 4,300 taels of gold. A gentleman from Jiangxi was given a piece as a gift, which cost 5,000 taels of gold. These were the larger pieces. In recent years, more and more have been excavated. Ma Heng and Xu Jun, collectors in Peiping, each obtained dozens of pieces. Every complete character costs 10 gold pieces, and incomplete characters cost 7 or 8 gold pieces. Even then, people still compete to buy them. In the past two years, there has been a ban on the export of antiquities. Dozens of pieces unearthed in Luoyang are piled up and cannot be sold. A month ago, Wang Xiantang and Liu Shouzhong, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, traveled to Luoyang and bought all the stone carvings for only 2,000 gold pieces. At that time, Zhang Puquan, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee in Luoyang, strongly advocated that Wang buy and preserve them. In the name of the Supervisory Yuan, he transported them to Shandong to be preserved by the Medical Library, which can add luster to the Ming Lake and Fushan.</p>

<p>Most of the Guan Zi books handed down in the world are 19-volume editions. The earliest 16-volume edition, according to historical records, was only seen by Han Yu. After that, it disappeared without a trace. Recently, the library purchased the Guan Zi, Erya, and other books in the Tang Dynasty manuscript from the Dunhuang Stone Chamber. The Guan Zi is especially precious. It was written by the magistrate of Dunhuang at that time and is exactly the 16-volume edition. Compared with the various editions handed down, there are many errors. The old Song and Yuan editions are not worth mentioning. The original is a handscroll, complete and undamaged, and the ink is still new. It can be called the only extant copy in the country and a rare and precious book.</p>

<p>The Guandi Temple at No. 3, Sujia Village, Yongning Bridge, outside Loumen, is a nunnery. At 3:00 p.m. on the 12th, a worshiper came, claiming to be fulfilling a vow. After entering the nunnery, he took out a dollar and ordered the old nun Yan Liang's apprentice, Guigen, to go out and buy cigarettes. When Guigen returned with the cigarettes, the worshiper was standing in front of the hall, but Yan Liang was nowhere to be found. A moment later, the worshiper left. Later, Yan Liang's body was found in the well in the back, upside down. Guigen then went into the room to check and found that more than 2,000 dollars were missing. Guigen immediately reported to the police station to track down the worshiper, but he had disappeared. The police station questioned Guigen about the worshiper's background, but his statement was vague. Therefore, it is widely rumored that Guigen is suspected of being an accomplice. Guigen was sent to the branch bureau and then to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The District Procuratorate sent Prosecutor Shen to inspect the scene at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (13th) and examined the body of the old nun Yan Liang. It was confirmed that she had drowned after falling into the well and that there were no injuries on her body. The local authorities were ordered to collect and bury the body.</p>

<p>A Fugitive Who Embezzled Funds is Escorted to Shanghai</p>
<p>Su Yunshan, a resident of No. 81, Hongqiao, in the city of Wuxi, used to run a ferry boat. His wife, Wu, due to financial difficulties, took her daughters Yuqin and Yuzhen to Qingdao to become prostitutes. Because the two daughters were beautiful, they soon became famous courtesans in Qingdao. Lu Lisheng (from Jiangdu, 24 years old), a salesman from the Shanghai Nanshi Yutai Bean Store, happened to go to Qingdao to handle goods and collect money. He met Su Yuzhen in a foreign land and spent all the 11,000 yuan of goods money he had collected, living together with her. Lu, fearing that the store would investigate, ordered Su Yuzhen and her mother to take the money back to Wuxi first, while he fled to Peiping to avoid the limelight. Recently, a local resident, Fang Wenqing, took Su Yuzhen to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Director Wu of the Public Security Bureau then sent detectives Wang Shuanglin and Yan Zengfu to Peiping to arrest Lu Lisheng. They arrested Lu at the Capital Hospital and transferred him to the Peiping Public Security Bureau. They delivered an official letter and escorted him to Wuxi. After Wu Zhaoxin, the chief of the third section, opened the court for interrogation, he ordered him to be detained temporarily. Just as he was about to be escorted to Shanghai for verification, two detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Yin Zhengtian and Chen Liangfu, came to Wuxi with a letter to take him into custody. Director Wu approved it, and at 9:00 p.m. on the 12th, Lu Lisheng was handed over to the officers to be escorted to Shanghai for interrogation.</p>

<p>These islands are crucial to national defense and transportation.</p>
<p>Negotiations should be conducted to protect inherent territory.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, in response to the French government's blatant occupation of the nine islands in southern Guangdong, which infringes upon our territory and endangers our national defense, telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting serious negotiations. The original telegram read: "To the Executive Committee of the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: It is reported that on the 25th of last month, the French government blatantly occupied nine small islands in southern Guangdong. This news has been received with deep indignation. It has been verified by the Guangdong provincial government that these nine islands are located south of Qiongya and are indeed our territory. They are situated between the Philippines and Annam, rich in aquatic products, and have long been inhabited by our people. Their importance to transportation and national defense is especially significant. Now, the French government is taking advantage of our nation's time of tribulation, imitating the September 18th Incident by the Japanese, and openly occupying them. This is outrageous. Moreover, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now collecting false evidence, hoping to get involved. If we remain silent and do not protest, then we will see imperialists gaining an inch and wanting a mile, devouring us like whales and silkworms without end. Our great territory may all be lost, leaving endless troubles for the future. Therefore, we urgently telegraph this matter, humbly requesting that you promptly conduct serious negotiations with the French government to prevent further covetousness and protect our territory. We earnestly await your response. The Shanghai General Labor Union, respectfully. First Month."</p>

<p>Li Haifeng's Troops Report on the Battle Situation</p>
<p>Popular Morale is High and the Japanese Army Suffers Great Losses</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army has recently become active again, with frequent skirmishes with the enemy. According to a recent telegram from Li Haifeng's troops in Rehe, the situation is as follows: "On July 20th, our troops stationed at Yanghe received a report from Zhou Zixiang, Brigade Commander of Fuxin, proposing a joint attack on Lingyuan. After receiving the report, Rong Xiangchao immediately led Zhang's brigade and Yao's brigade, marching east overnight. They arrived at Guandianzi in Lingyuan early on the 24th and immediately received a report that Liang's brigade of the Southern Rehe Volunteer Army and local militias, numbering about 3,000, were engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Daerdeng. Deputy Commander Rong immediately led his troops to intercept them and mobilized local militias to encircle the Japanese. The Japanese army sent 11 planes to drop bombs, destroying 12 villages, including Chapeng, Daerdeng, and Nianfang. More than 700 residents were killed or injured, and women and children who could not escape were burned to death, a truly tragic scene. The fighting continued until the evening of the 25th. Our troops and militias, due to the overwhelming firepower of the Japanese army, broke through the encirclement at midnight and attacked the Japanese rear. At this time, Zhang Xianglin, head of the Jianping Militia, also led his troops to assist in the battle, completely surrounding the Japanese army. A bayonet charge lasted for three hours. More than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Jing'an Guerrilla Unit led by Kojima Nakano was completely annihilated. Our troops suffered relatively few casualties, while the militia suffered about 700 deaths. Members of the local Red Spear Society, even those from over 200 li away, rushed to help in the battle. The strength of popular morale is evident. Although the local losses are devastating, anti-Japanese battles have broken out throughout Rehe province. In Suidong, more than a thousand civilians massacred over 30 Japanese police and military personnel overnight. Civilians rose up on the west bank of the Lao Ha River (Chifeng Weichang). Rehe is gradually becoming tense."</p>

<h3 id="e95">Observations on the International Situation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Far Eastern question will change after three years.</p>
<p>The Chinese people must actively build during this period.</p>
<p>Recently, an expert familiar with diplomacy shared his observations on the international situation, which are of great value for record-keeping, as follows: He stated that the Far Eastern question will undergo significant changes in three years. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has dared to act recklessly and disregard everything because it seeks to realize its dream of becoming the hegemon of East Asia. At the same time, its actions have been so aggressive because it believes that its imagined enemies on land and sea (i.e., the United States and the Soviet Union) have no real ability to intervene during this period. The fact that the United States and the Soviet Union have not acted as Japan expected is supported by evidence. The London Naval Treaty stipulates a ratio of 5:5:3 (i.e., 5 for England, 5 for the United States, and 3 for Japan) in naval holdings. To this day, the United States actually does not have 50% of its allotted holdings, while Japan has exceeded its allotment. At the time, the American authorities believed they had no disputes with others and did not pay much attention. It was not until the Far Eastern question arose that they realized the inadequacy of their naval power. Since the London Treaty will expire in 1936, they are now rushing to catch up, deciding to build 32 battleships with 300 million US dollars and repair existing destroyers with 70 million, with a three-year deadline, scheduled to be completed by the end of 1936. Before the completion of the three-year naval plan, the United States will definitely not make effective interventions on the Far Eastern question. This can be asserted. At the same time, relations between England and Japan have deteriorated recently due to trade disputes, which may lead to the anticipation of England and the United States joining hands in the future. Observing this, if something happens to the Far Eastern question, Japan's navy, although strong, will likely not prevail with a ratio of 3 to 10. On the Soviet side, from 1917 to 1927, the revolutionary government's policies were disliked by various countries. However, since 1928, it has changed its policy and started the first Five-Year Plan, focusing on the construction of the Soviet Union. After the September 18th Incident, the Five-Year Plan was nearing completion, and the second Five-Year Plan was about to begin, so it was unable to intervene in the Manchurian question. Now, the relationship between various countries and the Soviet Union is gradually recovering, and the second Five-Year Plan will also be completed in 1937. By then, with internal strength and restored diplomacy, the alliance between the United States and Russia to jointly restrain Japan is also a matter of course. However, the United States and Russia do not intervene in the Far Eastern question out of love for us. Instead, it is to maintain China's market and to maintain their rights in northern Manchuria. Therefore, our country's survival depends on the next three years. We must quickly build our nation within this short period, strengthening our politics, economy, and national defense, at least to the point of being able to defend ourselves. Otherwise, if Japan is defeated, but the United States and Russia still cannot maintain their rights and objectives, they will believe that China is incapable of self-government and will build it for us, which means control. If Japan wins, it will become even more arrogant and swallow China. Therefore, the Chinese people must actively build our nation and strengthen our self-defense capabilities before the Far Eastern storm breaks out.</p>

<p>The inflation of silver ingots is a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>According to sources in the Qian industry, since the abolition of the tael and the implementation of the yuan, the Qian industry can save one step in the process of converting taels to yuan in remittances and other transactions, which is quite convenient. However, at the beginning of implementation, silver ingots (i.e., yuanbao) are no longer circulated in the market, and they must be exchanged for new currency at the rate of 7.15 from the Central, China, and Communications Banks. However, the minting of new currency is only 100,000 yuan per day, while Shanghai has 20 million taels of silver ingots. Therefore, the exchange is very insufficient. Moreover, banks and firms from other places also use old silver ingots to settle accounts in Shanghai. Shanghai firms feel that there is a surplus of silver ingots and have no choice but to accept them, which makes them feel that there are too many yuanbao. Although a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the Central Mint increase the amount of minting, there has been no reply yet. Even if the amount is increased, it may be difficult to drastically increase it. Currently, transactions between firms are temporarily using factory bars (i.e., silver bars from the Central Mint, each bar worth 1,000 yuan) for mutual use, supplemented by the circulation of paper money. Therefore, although silver ingots are inflated, there is no feeling of illiquidity.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration previously caused a dispute over the cancellation of the Maigen Road Freight Station Stevedores Cooperative. After the Ministry of Railways, together with the Central Mass Movement Committee, repeatedly sent representatives Guo Zhongxing and Li Renzhu to Shanghai for investigation, the Ministry of Railways and the Mass Movement Committee mutually agreed to allow the establishment of a Maigen Road Freight Station Stevedores Office. This dispute was temporarily resolved. Yesterday, the bureau sent personnel to the station to register the workers in accordance with ministry orders. All the workers rose up in opposition, and the situation was quite serious. As a result, the dispute that had just been resolved resurfaced. The details are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e99">Registration Order <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(1) Any worker who wishes to register must first go to the verification department to verify the original brass tag issued by the bureau. The verification department will then ask the worker for their name, age, native place, and family status, filling in the appropriate columns of the stevedore register. At the same time, a registration request form will be issued to the worker. (2) After receiving the registration request form, the worker must take the form to the registration department to request a number. The registration department will assign a number in order, fill it in on the registration request form, and then return the form to the worker.

<h3 id="e101">The import of Japanese goods to the Yangtze River reaches in July surged two-fold <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Total volume reaches 12,622 tons</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that in the recent two months, the import of Japanese goods into Shanghai has surged. According to accurate surveys by the Japanese, the imports in July were the highest this year. Last month, the Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen's imported cargo totaled 18 ships in regular service, carrying a total of 12,622 tons of Japanese goods to Shanghai. This is an increase of 280 tons compared to the 11,383 tons imported in June. Among these goods, 2,328 tons were transshipped to various ports along the Yangtze River, more than twice the 510 tons imported to the Yangtze ports in June. Recently, the Japanese officials and merchants have felt that this increase in imports is a sign of improvement in Sino-Japanese relations and are mostly optimistic because it clearly demonstrates the decline of the anti-Japanese movement among the Chinese people. Regarding the categories of increased imports, sugar increased threefold compared to June. Cotton cloth and various textiles totaled 1,246 bales, which is a slight decrease compared to the previous month. Paper products totaled 1,387 pieces, an increase of over 200 pieces compared to June. Cotton totaled 850 bales (over 50 of which were Egyptian cotton, the rest being American cotton). Domestic Japanese cotton yarn merchants are currently rejecting Indian cotton, so the small number is due to other reasons. However, the most significant increase was in the import of chemical raw materials, specifically acids. In June, the total was less than 2,000 boxes, but in July it increased to 8,275 boxes. This reflects the improvement of the match industry and the cotton textile industry. Other goods, such as seafood, totaled 3,770 boxes, with high-priced shark fins increasing due to the reduction of import taxes. However, the Japanese observation on the increased imports is that the internal unrest in the Yangtze River interior and the decline of the rural economy prevent even larger imports.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Worker Declaration <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>All the workers at Maigen Road issued a declaration yesterday regarding the resolution formulated by the Central Mass Movement Guidance Committee and the Ministry of Railways and the deprivation of the right to be elected of the chief foreman Shen Yuqing and others. The declaration said: "Since the Maigen Road Station stevedores abolished the contract system and organized a cooperative five years ago, the chief foreman Shen Yuqing and others have led all the workers to abide by the railway regulations. The reason why all the workers can follow them is that the four chief foremen are fair and never favor anyone. The four chief foremen's external actions are absolutely based on the wishes of all the workers, which is especially trusted and supported by all our workers. After the Railway Bureau restored the contract system, the public was indignant, and finally, relying on the four chief foremen's efforts to persuade them, they continued to work as usual and, according to the guidance of the higher-level Party Department and trade union, argued with reason and waited quietly for a solution. Now, the Central Committee and the Ministry of Railways have formulated four solutions: (1) The contractors sent by the Railway Bureau must be cancelled; (2) The old cooperative should be changed into an office; (3) The office should elect two chief foremen to preside over everything; (4) The original four foremen shall not be elected as foremen after the reorganization. The fourth point, that the original four foremen shall not be elected as foremen after the reorganization, is what all our workers vow to oppose to the death. The chief foreman Shen Yuqing and others have traveled around for the contractor Yang Hengzhen. It is their duty to safeguard the interests of the workers. Unexpectedly, they have been envied, as if they could not be happy unless the four of them were removed, as if the four of them were Yang Hengzhen's funeral objects, and the deprivation of the right to be elected is without any basis. During this period of political tutelage, this kind of unfeeling and unreasonable method cannot exist. This is what all our workers will never accept. Now, the chief foreman Shen Yuqing and others have expressed their abandonment of the right to elect in order to clarify their intentions. It is important to know that it is not easy to say leave or stay when entrusted by all the workers. Therefore, we still order them to continue to be responsible and not be tempted or threatened. All seven hundred workers vow to be their backing."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Refusal to Register <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The General Affairs Department and the Traffic Department of the Railway Administration sent staff members at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, taking two first-class cars, to the Maigen Road Freight Station to register the workers. Immediately, eight registration tables were set up in the freight station, and the police chief Ma of the Railway Police Department led the railway police to maintain order. All the workers of the railway line refused to register in unison because they opposed the Railway Bureau's deprivation of the election rights of the four chief foremen. Mo Heng, Director of the General Affairs Department, and Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Traffic Department, went to persuade them after receiving the report, but there was no result. It is heard that the Railway Bureau will find another way to solve the problem.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Establishes a Tea Improvement and Experiment Factory to Reorganize the Tea Industry <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Receives a monthly appropriation of 1,000 yuan from the Jiangxi Tea Company</p>
<p>China's annual tea exports are worth over 30 million yuan. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the global economic recession and the adherence to traditional methods by Chinese tea merchants, the quantity of exports has declined sharply. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce once convened various exporters to discuss remedial measures and submitted resolutions to improve tea varieties, which were adopted by the Ministry. It is now learned that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, considering the large scale of the Zhenhua Tea Company in Xiushui, Jiangxi, sent a representative, Ye Yuanding, to Nanjing to discuss the matter with representatives from the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau. As a result, it was decided to take over the tea company and transform it into the China Tea Improvement and Experiment Factory, and to allocate monthly expenses of 1,000 yuan and initial operating expenses of 7,000 yuan. The expenses will be distributed as follows: 40% for the Agricultural Experiment Institute, and 30% for each of the two Commodity Inspection Bureaus. It is also heard that the company's machinery is very sophisticated, and there is hope for future development.</p>

<p>The factory has voluntarily sent them for safekeeping</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association received a report that the Peichang Factory on Taopeng Road violated the convention and pledge by buying enemy goods. The association sent investigators to the factory to persuade them to follow the association's resolution and deliver the goods to the association for safekeeping. Unexpectedly, the factory reported to the Yulin Road Police Station by telephone. The police station sent personnel to the factory to investigate and took all those involved to the police station. The association sent a committee member to inspect and confirmed that there were two large piles of Japanese iron. After questioning the association's personnel, Mr. Ma Wenhu, the accountant of the factory, replied that there was no wrongdoing and reported back to the association. The police station believed that the matter concerned public opinion and ordered the factory to be handled by the association. A reporter went to the association to inquire. The person in charge showed the reporter several documents and receipts issued by the Peichang Factory: "There is still more than one ton of side iron left, and we are willing to ask your association to take it away for safekeeping." "There are eight tons in the iron bucket. Without the consent of the association, we will never use it privately and will obey your instructions. In the future, we will never import again; otherwise, we are willing to be punished." There was also a pledge that we will never buy enemy goods and will accept the most severe punishment from the association if we import them privately. All of them were stamped with the factory's seal.</p>

<p>Second Promoters' Meeting Subscribes to Over 200,000 Shares</p>
<p>Seeking Production and Sales Cooperation to Complete China's Economic Barrier</p>
<p>The National Goods Production and Sales United Company held a meeting of initiators at the Bankers' Association the night before last. Those present personally subscribed to shares, and the total amount of the originally planned capital of 200,000 yuan was immediately exceeded. It was also resolved to increase the total capital to 500,000 yuan. Details are recorded below. The initiators of the company totaled 125 people. Those present that evening included Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Xinshan, Hu Bijiang, Feng Zhongqing, Li Zushen, Xue Dubi, Wang Binyan, Wu Tingsheng, Hu Xiyuan, Wu Zhihao, Ren Jinping, and over 40 others. The preparatory director, Lin Kanghou, presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>Speeches by Lin and Wang After the meeting began, the chairman first reported on the recent developments and the business procedures, which are divided into three major areas: (1) cooperation between production and sales; (2) cooperation between production and economy; (3) cooperation between economy and talent. He asked everyone to work hard in the hope of seeing early success. Next, Wang Xiaolai spoke, saying, "Today's weather is extremely hot, yet everyone has braved the heat to come here, which shows your enthusiasm for saving the country through production and supporting the cause of production and sales cooperation. From today onwards, this child, which has already been named the [China National Goods Production and Sales United Company], will regard everyone as nannies. I hope that everyone will treat it as a nanny and fulfill the responsibility of nurturing it, so that it will grow stronger and bigger day by day, so as to realize your aspirations of saving the country through production, building the cause of production and sales cooperation, and further using the power of this cause to unite and protect the economic interests that have been overflowing outwards, so that the sufferings of the people, which are full of sores, can be relieved. Since we have such high hopes for this child, we cannot but pay attention to the issues of its survival and education. Now, my colleagues have broadly summarized the opinions you have expressed on weekdays, the aspirations you hold, and the propositions you advocate, and have drafted a plan to nurture this child, outlining its main points as regulations for the survival and education of this child. However, I dare not hastily conclude whether these regulations are suitable. I sincerely hope that everyone will fulfill their responsibility as nannies and give us your advice so that the survival and education of this child can achieve the best results and bear the heavy responsibility of rescuing the wounded, supporting the living, seeking revenge, and wiping out shame for China."</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao's Report Next, Wu Zhihao reported, saying, "In the past three years, China, with its 450 million people, has been living under the daily disasters of natural disasters, man-made disasters, domestic troubles, and foreign invasions. Therefore, calls for national unity and long-term resistance have become everyone's ideal methods for saving the country and themselves. However, if there is only this method without the strength to assist this method and make it happen, then the method is tantamount to a dream. This is what Zhihao wishes to follow behind everyone and run errands for everyone's patriotic and loving aspirations. Since its inception, the China National Goods Production and Sales United Company has relied on everyone's enthusiastic introduction. As of today, there are already 125 initiators, and the amount of shares subscribed has reached over 100,000. This is indeed an achievement worthy of celebration and a record that shows the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for the production and sales business. The company's business procedures are based on three major principles: promoting sales and production cooperation, production and economic cooperation, and economic and talent cooperation. If these three principles can be fully developed, they will surely build a strong economic barrier for China to resist natural disasters and foreign invasions and eliminate man-made disasters and domestic troubles. My colleagues, in view of the results of the world economic conference, where everyone defended themselves and dispersed unhappily, deeply feel that the work of building an economic barrier for China is particularly important. This is for the sake of the national economy and the people's livelihood, for the survival of the nation, and for the implementation of national unity and long-term resistance. Everyone must do their best to support the establishment of the China National Goods Production and Sales United Company and to realize China's economic barrier as soon as possible. The China National Goods Production and Sales United Company is indeed a new front for the joint use of production, sales, economic, and talent. Therefore, anyone who wishes to save China and save the nation must work hard to build this new front to achieve the goal of no abandoned talent and no abandoned land, and to promote the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood after the completion of China's economic barrier." Next, Li Wanli spoke, saying that for the past 20 years, he has never ceased to promote national goods. This time, the spirit and perseverance of Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wu Zhihao, and other gentlemen in initiating the organization of the China Production and Sales Company are deeply admirable. With the joint efforts of many enthusiastic people at sea, success will surely be seen soon. He follows behind these gentlemen and is willing to do his part to fulfill his duties and work hard.</p>
<p>Capital of 500,000 After the speeches, shares were subscribed separately. It is estimated that those who signed up for subscriptions accounted for one-third of all initiators, subscribing to a total of 2,212 shares, totaling 221,200 yuan, which exceeded the original quota of 200,000 yuan. It was then agreed to expand the quota to 500,000 yuan, add preparatory committee members, and decide on banks and money shops to collect the shares and the date for collecting the shares.</p>

<p>Soliciting Names of Initiators from All Circles</p>
<p>The Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center in the Third Public Education District of Shanghai County believes that native cloth is woven by village women, is cheap and durable, and is the most economical clothing material. In recent years, due to the economic invasion of imperialism and the psychological influence of Chinese people favoring foreign goods, sales have declined, and the livelihoods of village women are in crisis. In order to promote native cloth and relieve the countryside, the center has once improved it, established a factory to research and weave, and established a store to supply the community. At the time of autumn coolness, it is planned to hold a native cloth movement conference in Shanghai, exhibit products, encourage use, invite celebrities to give speeches, and mix with entertainment, using the Municipal Public Education Center as the venue.

<h3 id="e116">Impersonating Court Investigators and Extorting Lawsuit Plaintiffs <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Such Incidents Have Been Repeatedly Heard</p>
<p>Huang Fan Recently Deceived</p>
<p>The Court Will Strictly Investigate</p>
<p>Recently, there have often been unscrupulous people impersonating investigators from the First Special District Court to intimidate and extort money from ordinary lawsuit plaintiffs. Many victims are unwilling to investigate further even after realizing they have been deceived because the losses are not significant, which makes these people bolder. According to various sources, the method of fraud is roughly the same. Before implementing the fraud, they enter the court hearing the case, sit high in the press gallery, hold a pencil, and act like they are taking notes. Government officials from the judge down think they are news reporters, and unless the case is prohibited from being heard, they are naturally not convenient to interfere. Thus, the swindler can fully know the contents of the case, choose the cautious party involved, and silently recognize them. The next morning, they read various newspapers. If they see a report of the case they are paying attention to, they follow the address of the plaintiff in the report and visit them. If they are met by the person they saw in court, they immediately state the details of the case and then claim that they are investigators sent by the court and are specifically investigating various points in the case. The person sees that their words mostly match the lawsuit and deeply believes that they are indeed investigators, and they treat them very kindly. They feel that their plan has been sold, and they further demand investigation fees or transportation fees, which amount to between five and six yuan. People suspect fraud even less because the amount is small. Even if they encounter one or two shrewd people who question why they are not wearing a uniform or ask for a receipt, the swindler responds at any time and makes excuses. Such fraud has been repeatedly heard recently. A few days ago, Fan, the wife of Huang Yichu, a Guangdong native, and Wu Lansheng, a neighbor, were involved in a lawsuit due to a dispute and also encountered this fraud, losing over seven silver dollars. When Liu Yugui of the First Special Court continued the hearing of the case yesterday, Huang Fan stated in court that she had been defrauded, just like the aforementioned situation. She said that the person was wearing a suit and claimed to be named Yuan, coming to summon my son Huang Keming to the case. I told him that my son had gone to Guangdong. Before leaving, the person demanded an investigation fee of five yuan, seven jiao, and five fen, and two yuan for transportation, and said that he needed to go to the opposing party for investigation and also collect the same fees from the opposing party. When I asked for a receipt, the person said that you women are ignorant and it is not convenient to give a receipt. Judge Liu then asked Wu Lansheng whether such a person had come before. Wu shook his head frequently. Judge Liu was furious that someone dared to borrow the court's name to deceive and swindle, and immediately announced the court's handling procedures, saying that the court must give a formal receipt for any fees collected, and court staff must wear uniforms when going out to work. If either of these two items is missing, it is an impersonation. The court has repeatedly issued orders regarding such incidents. Lawsuit plaintiffs should immediately hand over those who encounter such deception to the police station for legal handling and must not show any leniency. He also instructed that the case be adjourned and thoroughly investigated. It is heard that the court will strictly crack down on listeners in the future, except for those who have long-term listening tickets.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Gentlemen of Beiqiao <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Please Preserve Tang Dynasty Monuments</p>
<p>Beiqiao Bell Tower Said to Be a Tang Dynasty Building</p>
<p>One Generation's Historical Site Presented to County Government for Repair</p>
<p>The Beiqiao Township Bell Tower in Shanghai was built in the Tang Dynasty and is recorded in the county annals. However, it has been in disrepair for a long time and is increasingly collapsing. Previously, the Beiqiao Township Office and local people presented a request to the Shanghai County Government to allocate funds for repairs in order to preserve the monuments, but the County Government was limited by funds and had no funds to allocate, which has been delayed until now without starting repairs. The collapse of the bell tower is also increasing day by day. Now that the County Government has moved to the new Shanghai area in Beiqiao, it is appropriately facing the bell tower, but there is a distinction between the new and the collapsed, which has attracted the attention of local gentlemen. A few days ago, local people in Beiqiao specifically presented another request to the County Government, urging it to immediately allocate funds to start repairs, in order to preserve the monuments and restore the old appearance, so that the historical sites of one generation can be passed down permanently.</p>
<p>Wu asked if any such people had come before, Wu shook his head frequently, and Judge Liu was furious that someone dared to borrow the court's name to deceive and swindle, and immediately announced the court's handling procedures, saying that the court must give a formal receipt for any fees collected, and court staff must wear uniforms when going out to work. If either of these two items is missing, it is an impersonation. The court has repeatedly issued orders regarding such incidents.

<p>Forgetting That They Were Hiding Firearms</p>
<p>A Hen Crowing Brings Ruin to the Family</p>
<p>Li Wang, a woman from Liyang, 52 years old, had a son named Changfa, now 22 years old. Previously, through a matchmaker, he married Zhang, the daughter of Zhang Li, a woman from Haiyan. After entering the family, they lived together at No. 4, Hujunying Road, Nanshi, and their relationship was very harmonious. However, in June of last year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau suddenly received a secret report that Li Wang's family was hiding a large number of firearms, etc. They immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to the address and found three submachine guns and box cannons, etc. in the house. However, Li Wang and her son Changfa had already fled to Suzhou to hide after hearing the news. When his daughter-in-law Zhang noticed that Li Wang and others had already fled in fear of crime, she immediately fled to Hangzhou alone to temporarily avoid the limelight, so no one was arrested at that time. Later, in the spring of this year, Li Wang and her son Changfa came to Shanghai together, hiding at No. 144, Fujian Road, Public Concession, because the situation in Shanghai had calmed down slightly. Remembering that her daughter-in-law Zhang did not know where she was now, she rushed to Zhang Li's house to inquire, but according to Zhang Li, she also did not know her whereabouts. However, Li Wang thought that Zhang must be in her house, but Zhang Li was intentionally blocking her, but there was nothing she could do, so she left dejectedly. However, after Zhang fled to Hangzhou, she entered a factory in that port to work as a female worker. It was not until the day before yesterday that she came to Shanghai. Because she did not know the residence of Li Wang and others, she returned to her mother's house. Later, Zhang Li accompanied her to Li Wang's house. Unexpectedly, Li Wang thought that her mother-in-law Zhang Li had intentionally hidden her daughter until today before sending her, and she was very angry, so she refused to take her in. At about 4:00 PM yesterday, she gathered many hooligans in a tea house in the triangle street of Nanshi and invited Zhang Li and her daughter-in-law Zhang to gather and discuss the matter. Unexpectedly, while they were reasoning, Wu Wenzhou, the sentinel of the 25th post, heard about it and rushed to bring everyone to the First District and First Office under his jurisdiction. Under the preliminary trial of Director Yi, because Li Wang and others had previously been hiding firearms, the authorities</p>

<p>How He Died Requires Court Verification</p>
<p>Gu Yin, a rickshaw puller, lived in the Baotai area of Wusong and was dedicated to pulling carts in the Wusong and Baotai areas. However, there was another railway pass on the railway section. Previously, it was collected at thirty cents a month, but after the Shanghai battle, due to the difficulty of life, it was reduced to fifteen cents, which was collected by Zhu Kaixiang, Han Jinbiao, Wang Bingsheng, etc. This month, on the 9th, they collected from Gu, but Gu only had ten cents, lacking five cents, and was beaten severely, fainting on the spot. He was sent to the hospital for treatment and died yesterday. However, Gu's mother, Gu Zhang, only had one son and relied on his livelihood. She was harmed for no reason and died, not only cutting off her descendants but also cutting off her livelihood, so she filed a complaint with the 7th District and 1st Office and arrested Zhu and others. Unexpectedly, they all reported that the deceased died of heatstroke. They were immediately presented to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court yesterday. After the prosecutor's preliminary trial, he ordered them to be detained together and ordered the plaintiff to bring the body to the court for verification.</p>

<p>Sublettees Unexpectedly Profit</p>
<p>Sublessors Forced to Move Out</p>
<p>Xinxin News reported that recently, there have been special merchants digging up houses in Zhabei at high prices. After sublessors have obtained unexpected profits, they order tenants to move out, and disputes have arisen as a result. Citizens Li Zutang, Feng Yixian, Sun Menghua, Zhang Yichen, Ye Qichang, Hang Wujiu, Du Chunsu, Shen Yanqing, etc., were saddened by this situation and jointly presented a petition to the municipal government, requesting that it be strictly cracked down on in order to protect the housing rights of citizens. The original petition is recorded as follows: "Presented for special merchants to dig up houses at high prices and sublessors to be forced to move out, requesting review and crackdown to extend justice. On April 21 of this year, Decree No. 82 of Your Office promulgated the Shanghai Municipal Housing Leasing Rules,</p>

<p>Intention is Thorough, and All Residents are Grateful. Citizens believe that housing security has been guaranteed since then. However, recently, there have been special merchants planning to dig up houses in areas such as Tianbao Lane, Tianxin Lane, Shenggu Lane on Baoshan Road, Anxiang Lane on Datong Road, Sanxin Lane on North Sichuan Road, and Xinguangdong Street at high prices. For example, No. 3 Tianbao Lane, No. 1 Tianxin Lane, and No. 32 Shenggu Lane, after the houses in other lanes were dug up, the merchants still planned to wait for the households to plan to dig, and the process continued. For a time, there were many discussions in each lane. General sublessors took the opportunity to live in wonder, hoping to sell at a good price, like crazy heat. As a result, the merchants and sublessors got what they wanted, and the poor subtenants were bound to be displaced, and even homeless. If they want to move, there is no house for a while, and if they want to stay, the situation does not allow it. Those who have moved out endure the pain of leaving the house, and those who have not moved out are</p>

<p>Moreover, during this hot summer, it is difficult to find a house and hire workers. Residents of the houses being dug up have heard of disputes. All these things are pitiful. Citizens have lived in Zhabei for many years and are heartbroken to see it. They have to truthfully appeal. It is found that Article 7 of the Shanghai Housing Leasing Rules promulgated by Your Office states: [All small rent digging fees are strictly prohibited.] Article 10: [If the landlord demolishes and builds a house, he should apply to the Bureau of Public Works for approval and notify each tenant to move out three months in advance, and the last two months' rent should be waived, but this is not limited to special agreements longer than the provisions of this article.] Article 11: [When the sublessor receives the notice from the landlord in accordance with Article 10, he shall immediately notify the subtenant and shall waive the rent in accordance with Article 10.] Article 12: [Except as provided in Article 10, the landlord or sublessor shall not force a tenant or subtenant who pays rent to move out. If the landlord takes back the house for his own use or changes the property rights and orders the tenant to move out, the landlord shall refund three months' rent, etc.] Now it is found that the houses in each lane are neither demolished nor</p>
<h3 id="e127">Change of Property Rights <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>It is undeniable that some special commercial firms are digging up prices, sub-tenants are taking the opportunity to make profits, and disregarding everything. (The landlord stipulates that the rented house shall not be replaced privately, and it is stated on the house ticket. Article 7 of the Shanghai Municipal House Leasing Rules promulgated by your government also clearly stipulates this.) This has led to various unfortunate events such as ordering relocation and causing disputes. It is undeniable that the landlord or sub-tenant and the merchant are contemptuous of the law and only seek profit. However, the citizens feel that their residence is not guaranteed, so they have to truthfully state the facts and hope that you will investigate and strictly ban them to protect their rights and maintain the law. Please approve and follow the instructions, and please instruct the Public Security Bureau to investigate and strictly prohibit them. Deeply grateful to the public, respectfully presented to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>

At about 11:00 AM yesterday, seven Japanese suddenly arrived in Song by car from Shanghai and went to the pond to fish with rods. A neighbor, Jiang Shihua (20 years old, working for Shanghai Jianchen Foreign Company), saw it and immediately stepped forward to interfere, telling them that the fish pond was the private property of the people and could not be caught casually. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ignored him, and a dispute broke out between the two sides. Although Jiang was alone at the time, he was also unwilling to show weakness and resisted. As a result, he was outnumbered, and his head was beaten and injured. He was also pressed into the fish pond and almost died. Fortunately, a passerby, Yin Changfu, blew the whistle frantically. The police arrived and took the group to the Seventh District of Public Security, where Director Li interrogated them. After Jiang Shihua stated the circumstances of the assault, the Japanese, including Kanahara Tashiro (Shanghai Feilun Road Senmura Foreign Company), Maruyama Kentaro (Haining Road Gongli Company), Niimi Tomiji (same), Sato Kichibei (student), Matsuo Eizo (Rikin Foreign Company), Arai Kishijiro (Wuchang Road Restaurant), and Irie Biichi (Wusong Road Taiyo-sha Laundry), Director Li questioned them and then ordered the Japanese to sign the Foreigners' Violation Report and ordered them to leave. He also prepared a document to report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate.</p>

<p>Wang Haitian from Zhejiang, also known as Wang Ziqing, is 46 years old this year.

<p>As a result, he was arrested.</p>
<p>The flower gambling, which is more harmful than floods and fierce beasts, has been popular again recently. Even the villages and towns near this port have established listening tubes and boats. Therefore, gamblers who are deeply addicted to flower gambling hope to obtain huge profits, and they are all busy playing the tide. (The word "playing the tide" refers to asking the gods, divination, praying for dreams, drawing lots, and various despicable acts.) They are like crazy people, almost forgetting to eat and sleep. Liu Lushi, a woman living at No. 47, Chunyangli, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai, has also been deeply addicted to flower gambling recently. She has made a desperate bet, and she has lost a lot. Therefore, her efforts to play the tide, such as asking the gods and divination, have not been successful. A few days ago, she suddenly learned that Li Amao, a young man living at No. 39 in the same neighborhood, could carry a tube (carrying a tube means that a god is possessed and predicts the name of the flower). It has been repeatedly tested and is known to the people nearby. Therefore, the clan was very happy when she heard about it, thinking that she could make a huge profit through this. So, at about 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, she invited Li to her home, burned incense and kowtowed. Li immediately babbled, as if a god was possessed. Then, he said that the flower gambling could hit the two doors of "Ban Gui" and "Feng Chun". The clan kowtowed in thanks, and because she threw a lot of numbers, she ordered her husband, Liu Ada, to take the money to Shanghai and hit it in the big tube. Unexpectedly, in the evening, she received a fast horse report that it was indeed the above-mentioned two doors. So, Liu won 600 yuan for "Ban Gui" and 1,000 yuan for "Feng Chun", which was spread far and wide. Until the next morning (the day before yesterday morning), Li thought that the Liu clan had already obtained a huge amount of money, why there was still no reward sent. Li went to the clan and said, "Since yesterday until now, the god is still possessed and has not retreated, and the body feels quite uncomfortable. I need to ask a doctor to treat it." Because her husband had not returned to Shanghai and she did not know how much she had won, she refused with harsh words. Not only did she not reward or treat him, but she also drove him away. When Li's mother, Zhu, heard about it, she immediately rushed over and twisted Liu Chenshi to the police and detained her in the sixth district, accusing Liu Chenshi of forcing her son Li Amao to ask the gods for flowers, causing harm to his body. After District Officer Jiang interrogated her, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the General Bureau for interrogation because the case involved flower gambling.</p>

Last year, she participated in a share of the ten-person association initiated by Yang Jingwen from Shaobo, paying one yuan per month. However, when the association expired, Yang Jingwen privately used the association money. Later, she asked him to recover the debt, but Yang avoided it and has not yet repaid it. At about 3:00 PM yesterday, she glimpsed Yang Jingwen leaving Zhao Huazhang's house at No. 10, Yufuli, Zhangjiabang, and immediately twisted Yang to recover the debt. Zhao came out to mediate and promised Wang Lushi to pay it off at 8:00 PM that night. He then helped Yang to pull her away with force. Unexpectedly, he accidentally fell down and did not move. At first, they thought he was faking it. Yang helped him up, and carefully examined that his nose was scratched and slightly injured, and his face was pale and dying. Zhao's grandfather, Zhu Da, arrived and reported the situation to the police and sent Zhao to the Second District General Office by car. After interrogation, it was found that Zhao was out of breath. He asked Gu Jinming, a Western doctor from Fangbangqiao, to inject brain saline solution. He was transferred to the local court, but Zhao died on the way. He then sent the body back to Zhangjiabang by car, and reported to the court for inspection.</p>

<p>Kong Yongsheng, a native of Zhenjiang, the backstage manager of the Sanmin Theater at No. 93, Zhoujiazui Road, is in his twenties. Dai Aping, a local gangster, often went to the theater to watch free shows and arbitrarily disturbed the theater. Kong had to dissuade him because it was related to the business. Therefore, Dai harbored resentment in his heart and repeatedly tried to harm Kong. At 7:30 the night before, Kong happened to go out on business and was detected by Aping, who gathered several accomplices and waited on the way, intending to find fault with Kong. Unexpectedly, Kong was extremely alert. Seeing that the situation was not good, he avoided it in the middle of the road, and finally escaped the disaster. At about 6:00 AM yesterday, Kong was still getting up when Aping suddenly invited many people and broke into his bedroom, raising an axe and slashing at Kong, totaling three axes on the head and two axes on the feet. The murderers saw that their goal had been achieved and fled. The theater staff found that Kong was unconscious and bleeding all over the bed, which was unbearable to see. They immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car and reported the crime to the police station. It is said that Kong's injuries were too severe and his life was in danger.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Sichuan Fellow Association Meets to Raise Relief Funds <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Sichuan Fellow Association held a standing committee meeting at the association's office to discuss helping the refugees displaced in the Red areas of northern Sichuan. In addition to all the members of the committee attending, He Baoheng, Zi Zhong, and Li Shenpei, the representatives of the petitioners for the Red disaster in northwestern Sichuan, attended and explained the Red disaster in detail. According to the representatives, more than two-thirds of the people in more than a dozen counties in northern Sichuan have fled due to the Red bandits making a comeback. There are now more than two million refugees gathered in the east and west of Sichuan. The refugee shelters set up by charitable organizations in various places are full, and food is also in short supply, with a tendency to be insecure in the morning and evening. The Red bandits learned of this situation and used various methods to lure the refugees back to their hometowns to be used by them. If they are not quickly relieved and settled, the weak will die in the trenches, and the strong will inevitably be absorbed by the Red bandits. If the other party gets the help of this large number of good people, it will be like a tiger with wings, and the situation will sit down. It is conceivable that the danger is unimaginable. The association is deeply concerned about the lives of more than two million people in Sangzi and the safety of the entire Sichuan. It is deeply feared that the Red Army's conspiracy will trap Sichuan in the second Jiangxi. Therefore, seven measures were decided, and several important cases were discussed. The resolutions are as follows: ㈠ The Chongqing Relief Committee sent a telegram and sent representatives to the meeting to explain the disaster situation of the Red disaster in northern Sichuan, and asked the association to raise funds for relief. The resolutions were: (A) Send a telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Disaster Relief Committee, requesting a large amount of relief money to relieve the refugees displaced in the Red areas of more than a dozen counties in northern Sichuan. (B) Send a letter to various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this port, requesting relief. (C) Send a letter to Chinese members of the Central Committee and people from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai, requesting them to report to the Central Government and the Yuan and appeal to philanthropists in Beijing and Shanghai. (D) Send Zhong Hangsu, Qiu Zhuozhong, Li Qingfan, and three representatives, together with the representatives of the petitioning group for the Red disaster in northwestern Sichuan, to meet with Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of the city, at 10:00 AM next Tuesday, and ask him to advocate the formation of a fundraising and relief agency by officials and civilians. (E) Schedule a joint reception with the representatives of the petitioning group for reporters, charitable organizations, and philanthropists in this city to report the disaster situation and ask for publicity and assistance. (F) Organize a special committee for fundraising to specialize in raising donations and handling relief matters, and temporarily hire Li Qingfan, Yu Yuanhui, Qiu Zhizhong, Zheng Yushu, Li Xunfu, Shao Jizhen, and Bi Yaquan as members. (G) The various matters decided today will be telegraphed to the Chongqing Relief Committee, Pan Wenhua, and others. ㈡ Can the Executive Committee member and Director of the Publishing Committee, Xie Zhaohua, return to Sichuan to represent the association in calling for peace in the Sichuan War and suppressing the Red Army to secure Sichuan? The resolution was: passed. ㈢ Zhong Hangsu, a member of the Executive Committee of the Association, is now practicing as a lawyer. Can he be hired as the legal counsel of the Association? The resolution was: passed. ㈣ The Shanghai All Circles Clearing and National Salvation Donation Committee asked the Association to reply with the amount of damage to the funds in order to clarify the truth. The resolution was: hand over the documents for verification and reply. ㈤ The Post Office Administration replied to the Association, saying that the postal items detained in Zinei, Sichuan, have been ordered to the Xichuan Post Office to verify and report on how to deal with them.

<p>Draft Rural Revitalization Plan of the Municipal Social Bureau (Continued)</p>
<p>Second Revitalization Plan</p>
<p>1.  Adjusting Rural Finance: Due to various reasons, rural finance is most easily concentrated in urban areas, causing the rural economy to wither and making it difficult for all undertakings to develop. To revitalize rural finance, it is necessary to first pay attention to the adjustment of rural finance and to establish more rural financial institutions to lend directly or indirectly to farmers, so that the finance concentrated in cities can flow to the countryside. In this way, urban and rural finance will be like the flow of liquids, circulating endlessly without any imbalance. The methods are: (A) Establishing a Farmers' Bank: A Farmers' Bank is a financial institution that supports the economic development of farmers and supplements their economic shortcomings. In foreign countries, it is often called an Agricultural and Industrial Bank, because in addition to farmers, it is also necessary to support a part of small industries. In China, 80% of the population are farmers, so establishing a Farmers' Bank is relatively simple and meets the needs. The business of the Farmers' Bank is to lend to farmers at low interest rates, and the farmers use the money to purchase plowing cattle, fertilizers, seeds, etc., to engage in farming. After harvesting, they sell the agricultural products to repay the loan. If unfortunately there are natural disasters or man-made misfortunes and the harvest is poor, making it impossible to repay, they can wait until the following year. This is the characteristic of the Farmers' Bank. There are very few Farmers' Banks in various parts of our country. The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank is the most scaled among them. According to the report for the year 20, the bank has been established for four years, with 20 branches and a capital of 2 million yuan. Although it cannot be said that it has brought much benefit to the 30 million farmers in Jiangsu, it is a new venture and there are many difficulties in running it, so it is not easy to achieve such results. Although there are poverty relief and agricultural loans in this city, farmers actually benefit very little, because its capital is not much and there are restrictions on lending. Therefore, the poverty relief loan office should expand its capital and form a Farmers' Bank to lend to farmers as much as possible in order to adjust rural funds. (B) Establishing Agricultural Warehouses: Agricultural warehouses can adjust prices and activate finance, which is of great benefit to farmers. It has long been popular in Eastern and Western countries, and the effect is quite significant. The biggest source of wealth in rural areas is the income from agricultural products. The prices of agricultural products often fall after the harvest due to oversupply in the market, and unscrupulous merchants and local tyrants take the opportunity to monopolize and speculate. Farmers are forced to sell their year's hard-earned harvest in pain because of the urgent need for cash, and they cannot wait for a good price. Farmers' income is greatly reduced. If there are agricultural warehouses, farmers can store their agricultural products in the warehouse and wait for a good price. At the same time, the agricultural warehouse issues warehouse receipts, which can be used as collateral for cash. Farmers in this city are oppressed by the urban economy, and this warehouse equipment is particularly needed. Therefore, each district should plan to establish one in order to adjust rural finance.</p>
<p>2.  Revitalization of Rural Construction: There are many matters that need to be constructed in rural areas, and the most important are: (A) Dredging Rivers and Improving Farmland Water Conservancy: The rivers in the farmland of this city are either silted up or narrow, and this is the case everywhere. Whenever there is a heavy rain or continuous rain, they are often submerged due to poor discharge. Agricultural crops are either withered or damaged, affecting crop yields and reducing economic income. Therefore, the rivers in each district that are silted up should be dredged, and the narrow ones should be expanded, or new rivers should be opened up to facilitate farmland drainage and increase agricultural output. (B) Building Roads and Dikes to Facilitate Rural Transportation and Prevent River Tides: Although this city belongs to an area with convenient transportation, once you get to the countryside, the roads are narrow and it is difficult for vehicles and horses to travel. The transportation of agricultural products is quite inconvenient, which reduces sales and greatly affects the prices of agricultural products. Therefore, rural roads should be tidied up and built to facilitate transportation. Also, this city borders the river and the sea, and is often subject to tidal surges, which cause dikes to break, flooding fields and endangering rural lives and property. Therefore, dikes should be built to protect against floods. (C) Building New Villages to Set Examples: Improving rural life and revitalizing the economy are not matters that can be accomplished overnight. The government should delineate appropriate areas in the countryside and build a model new village, and earnestly implement improvements in all aspects, such as improving agricultural affairs, preventing pests and diseases, promoting sideline industries, organizing cooperatives, adjusting finance, and improving all construction aspects, to establish a model for rural areas in this city, so that rural areas in each district can follow suit and complete the rural revival (end)</p>

<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>It is said that in the Second World War, everyone will [go high and go far], fighting in the [clouds]. Therefore, the Italian planes, touring the United States, caused great stimulation to the Americans. The Japanese can climb to the roof with their air defense forces in two minutes and open anti-aircraft guns in the darkness of the city, and they feel safe enough in air defense. Moreover, it is said that in the next war, throwing a few incendiary bombs or 500-pound bombs is not a good show; you have to show off your magic weapon and play with [poison gas bombs].</p>
<p>[Going high and going far] is naturally cheaper. Airplanes and anti-aircraft guns, like the ancient relics of the Forbidden City, are equally cherished and precious in China. Japanese planes are not at all admiring. However, watching the Tokyo air defense exercise, three [hypothetical enemy] [hypothetical planes] came leisurely and left triumphantly. The defense forces hid on the roof and fired anti-aircraft guns, but did not shoot down any [spoils]. Instead, they discovered the danger that there were too few shelters for the people and that the tap water pipes were buried too shallowly. Japan is extremely uneasy about the [hypothetical enemy] on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, but unexpectedly, the [Japanese hypothetical enemy] on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, seeing the success of the Italian planes, is also greatly concerned. It can be seen that it is still relatively easy to drive a plane to [shit] in other people's territory. It is somewhat difficult to prevent enemy planes from [shitting], or to make them not dare to come to [shit].</p>
<p>Under the air defense exercise, the air defense forces are already a little unable to cope with [incendiary bombs]. If they really play with [poison gas bombs] in the future, although everyone will wear cigarette cans on their mouths, or be more sophisticated and put gas masks on the faces of cattle, sheep, cats, and dogs, these methods of [thieves leaving the door] will not scare away the enemy planes, nor will they have the ability to display the enemy planes as [spoils]. Therefore, so-called [air defense] is, in my opinion, just that.</p>

<p>The azure night, like dew, covers the river like a blue cloth belt. The Riva Litta Village, under the high, bright sky, opens its intoxicating eyes.</p>
<p>Bathing in the bright moonlight, on the river shimmering with silver scales, the small boat floats gently.</p>
<p>There is no hissing of cicadas. There is no singing of nightingales. The surroundings are condensed into a realm of tranquility. Occasionally, a sound of sculling comes from the water, like the morning bell of a lonely mountain temple, echoing the low cry of the lonely geese of the night.</p>
<p>Such a big, round silver plate floats beside the boat, unable to be scooped up or broken. Is it the moon falling from the sky? Or is it the dressing mirror thrown down by the girl?</p>
<p>The wind brings jazz music from the village, shattering the virgin beauty of the quiet river like a devil!</p>
<p>Putting down the oars, I and she lie on the deck, looking at the blue sky, white clouds, big moon, and the stars like goldfish eggs. The small boat flows with the water. Flowing like skating, boat! Follow the flowing water, flow to the kingdom without jazz music, without the fragrance of women, without man-eating devils!</p>
<p>Making dreamlike memories under the weeping willows, singing lowly...</p>
<h3 id="e163">Key Tips for Modern Women's Adornment (Part 1) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>For modern women, regardless of whether they are from the East or the West, the essential requirements for inner beauty are perming their hair, shaping their eyebrows, applying lipstick, and painting their nails. I have already discussed hairstyles last month. Now, I will introduce the three aspects of shaping eyebrows, applying lipstick, and painting nails in detail. In general, fashionable women who understand these key points can steal the show and be admired everywhere.</p>
<p>Key Points for Shaping Eyebrows</p>
<p>Among makeup techniques, shaping eyebrows and applying lipstick are the most difficult. If the makeup is not done properly, it will not only fail to enhance beauty but will also reveal ugliness, reducing the original attractiveness. This is something we often see in social gatherings and dance halls. So how can one enhance their beauty? To put it simply, everyone should consider the shape of their facial features and correct any shortcomings to maintain their original charm and add a special appeal. For example, for people with broad foreheads and large eyes, drawing thin, elongated eyebrows would be very inappropriate. For people with delicate foreheads, small, pointed eyes, and flat cheeks, drawing curved, thin eyebrows can add a special beauty. Currently, the six most popular eyebrow styles worldwide are: first, the "Dietrich" (named after a German actress) eyebrow, with the eyebrow head pointing downwards and the tail slanting upwards, with the eyebrow line becoming thinner from thick; second, the "figure-eight" eyebrow, with no sharp angles at the eyebrow head and curved parallel to the eyes; third, the "willow leaf" eyebrow, shaped like a willow leaf, slanting upwards from the corner of the eye near the nose; fourth, the "Jizo" eyebrow, with a slight curve, the eyebrow head being higher and gradually sloping down to the eyebrow tail; fifth, the "moth" eyebrow, shaped like the eyebrows of a silkworm moth; and sixth, the "wave" eyebrow, with a short, curved eyebrow line. All of the above six eyebrow shapes require surgery to modify and move the position of the original eyebrows, and they should be drawn according to each person's facial features, the width of the forehead, the size and slope of the eyes, the length and height of the nose, the distance between the eyes, and the distance between the eyebrows and the hairline. For people with long, thin faces, high, narrow nose bridges, and small eyes, drawing the Jizo eyebrow is the most suitable. For people with round faces, drawing the figure-eight eyebrow can show off their beauty, because people with round faces have their hair and eyebrows close together. If the position of the eyebrows is not moved to a suitable place, the face will appear even shorter and wider. People with narrow foreheads and long faces will make their faces appear even longer if they draw thick, short wave eyebrows. Therefore, when choosing eyebrows, be sure to consider the shape of the face, the position of the eyebrows, and the distance between the facial features. In general, when foreign women go to beauty salons for makeup, they first ask the makeup artist to point out the shortcomings of their facial features, then consider the position of their facial features, and choose a suitable eyebrow shape. Modern women in Shanghai don't understand their own shortcomings and simply imitate others, drawing eyebrow shapes randomly. As a result, they detract from their original charm. This point should be paid special attention to!</p>
<p>Key Points for Applying Lipstick</p>
<p>The magic of lips has been fully demonstrated in movies. When the heat of love between men and women in the world reaches its peak, the lips of the man and woman will definitely feel like magnets attracting each other. Therefore, lip makeup is particularly important. In the past, ancient Chinese women only knew how to apply rouge. The so-called cherry red at that time was to apply a cherry-shaped red dot on the middle of the upper and lower lips with rouge. This cherry red could evoke a sense of beauty. Nowadays, the full-lip red style that has been passed down from the West will definitely reveal an extremely ugly state if the secret is not understood.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Abandoning Post to See Soulmate, Beauty Quietly Approves; Inheriting Family Fortune, Strong Man Celebrates Wildly</p>
<p>The two left the shop and returned to their respective camps. The next day at noon, Guan Yaowu went to Yang's house to visit Old Mrs. Yang. He had only called out "Aunt" once in the courtyard when he heard Jiang's voice from inside the house, "Come in. I figured you'd be coming." Guan Yaowu was surprised. "How did she know I was coming today?" He lifted the curtain and went inside. Jiang invited him to sit in the inner room. Guan Yaowu laughed, "How are you, Aunt? I've been busy and haven't been able to visit you. Where's our cousin?" Jiang smiled slightly and said, "She's hiding." Guan Yaowu was even more puzzled. Why would she hide? Jiang took out a box of cigarettes from a drawer in the small table. The cigarette pack was unopened, clearly newly bought. She picked up an old porcelain teapot from the edge of the white stove in the middle of the room, poured a cup of tea, and placed it on the table. The color of the tea also indicated it was freshly brewed. Everything was newly prepared, not just something they happened to have. He realized that Jiang and her daughter knew he was coming. But how did they know? This was strange. He smiled and asked Jiang, "I heard you went to Beijing for a trip. How long has it been since you've been there? Has the city changed much?" Jiang replied, "It's pretty much the same. Cousin, you're a busy man. We're family, so it's always good to talk things over. Don't you want to drink our girl's winter melon soup? Just say what you came for." Guan Yaowu laughed, "Since you've guessed it, there's no point in denying it. I originally heard that Aunt was in favor of this marriage, but why did you suddenly become indifferent?" Jiang sat on a square stool by the window, lifted the piece of paper covering the small glass pane, and looked outside. After looking, she lowered her voice and smiled at Guan Yaowu, "Don't you know the reason for that? It's because he's a soldier and away from home a lot. Besides, although there's the prospect of promotion and wealth in the future, this kind of job isn't as stable as other jobs after all." (157)</p>

<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>A group of young heroes of the street gather at the corner, fighting over their rights like warlords fighting for territory. On the cement pavement, they fiercely attack each other. Small fists swing, and hot sweat drips from their dirty skin, leaving dark ink marks on their chests. A semi-modern woman walks out of the alley, fixing her gaze on these two fighting heroes and shouting to stop their quarrel. "You little rascals, be careful or I'll tell your uncles." The two young heroes who were fighting so hard stop and lean against the corner of the wall across the alley, silent with sheepish faces. This is more powerful than a declaration to abolish civil war.</p>
<p>A deformed beggar arches his hands on the crowded street, putting on an embarrassing crying face, begging for alms from the young masters and ladies. Soon, a large pile of copper coins accumulates. Not far away, a similar loafer, wearing an Indian silk short shirt and pants, pulls down his high collar, exposing his chest. He walks up to the beggar, moves the copper coins to the other side, and wraps them in old newspaper. Someone says, "This is the profession of some people in Shanghai, far better than the average laborer who works all day."</p>
<p>At the tram stop, there are often several six- or seven-year-old children clinging to your chest, asking you to buy an evening newspaper. "Sir, thank you, won't you buy one?" Many people who were not planning to buy a newspaper often take out their money because of this. A friend told me, "This is someone's doing." But for an innocent, unspoiled child, just the fact that he is being instructed is enough for us to pity him!</p>
<p>Passing the middle of ×× Road, in a place fenced off with bamboo to build a cinema and dance hall, a tin advertising sign is nailed up outside, "Comfort for the heart, comfort for the body." It tells us this so blatantly. No wonder today's movies have no educational meaning and only seek sensual pleasure. Dance halls also don't include any social interaction or entertainment but only seek sexual release. I finally felt lost and bewildered, perhaps this is a vague snapshot of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e166">In Front of My Wife <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Chao Shen</p>
<p>In front of your wife, don't always wear a frown, exaggerating the difficulties of dealing with partners.</p>
<p>In front of your wife, don't see her only as a wife who bears your children, but as a lover who regulates your life. In front of your wife, don't make married life too bland, but rather make life more tortuous and interesting.</p>
<p>In front of your wife, you should often tell one or two new jokes to elicit a gentle smile from her.</p>
<p>In front of your wife, never mention any close friendships with any female friends.</p>
<p>In front of your wife, never praise the beauty of any other woman. In front of your wife, you should often praise the admirable aspects of your wife.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Thunderstorm <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Xiaomi</p>
<p>In the afternoon, there was a faint rumble of thunder in the sky. The weather was particularly stuffy. Dark clouds quickly gathered from all directions, thick and low, and soon covered up the scorching sun. The sky appeared very frightening, dark and gloomy, as if it were about to collapse.</p>
<p>People felt unusually agitated, their chests felt like they were carrying something weighing millions of pounds, making it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>The sound of thunder echoed back and forth in the dense clouds, and lightning flashed out of the clouds from time to time. The tops of the trees were silent from the cicadas' chirping, only a large group of dragonflies flitted back and forth in the courtyard.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a crack of thunder, the sky seemed to explode. Raindrops the size of soybeans shot down like a rain of arrows, falling on the sun-scorched ground and turning into rising vapor.</p>
<p>The heavy rain lashed down like arrows, filling the ears with surging sound. The thunder rolled louder in the clouds, and lightning flashed back and forth between the clouds.</p>
<p>An old farmer smiled, watching the sky with his pipe in his mouth, and said, "With this rain, there should be a good harvest this autumn."</p>
<p>The dark clouds slowly dispersed, and the rain gradually stopped. The cicadas chirped loudly in the treetops, and sunlight shone back down to the ground through the clouds. The surging sounds disappeared, and the air seemed excessively quiet.</p>
<p>A few cool breezes blew after the rain, making me feel exceptionally good. I once fell in love with a girl,</p>
<p>That girl wore clothes as blue as the sky,</p>
<p>That girl's eyes were like stars in an autumn night,</p>
<p>That girl's soul was as pure as a full moon. - Where is that girl? - She asked in a sour tone, - Don't be angry! That girl is you! -</p>
<p>- - Red clouds flew onto her cheeks, and she buried her head in my arms, laughing softly:</p>
<p>- What an adorable child! Mischievous, mischievous!</p>
<p>Kissing her red lips, a taste like chewing fresh fruit! - So sweet!</p>
<p>Several small boats, like swallows skimming the water, glided past, and the people on board were also so happy, whistling and singing serenades.</p>
<p>Summer, a happy season! On the river in the village of Valida, my dried-up, nineteen-year-old heart flower has been irrigated with sweet dew and is blooming vigorously!</p>

<h3 id="e168">Thirty-One Organizations Send Off Students Going Abroad <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu serves as Chairman of the General Assembly and delivers the opening speech</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Li Zhaohuan, Zhang Shouyong, and others all gave speeches</p>
<p>The send-off gathering for students going abroad prepared by the World Chinese Students' Federation, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, and the Shen Bao's thirty-two cultural organizations was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Municipal Government Garden at 1881 Avenue Joffre. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e169">Attendees <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Central Bank President Kong Xiangxi, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Belgian Consul in Shanghai Tan Erfu, American Vice Consul Allen, Health Bureau Director Li Ting'an, Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongsi, Public Utilities Bureau Director Xu Peihuang, Public Works Bureau Director Shen Yi, British Boxer Indemnity Committee Xu Heshi, Jiaotong University Li Zhaohuan, Guanghua University Zhang Shouyong, Shanghai Art College Liu Haisu, Fudan University Huang Yingsu, Municipal Bureau of Education Zeng Shengdian, World Chinese Students' Federation Zhu Shaoping, Vocational Education Society Pan Yangyao, American Returned Students Association Cao Yunxiang, Zhongshan Cultural Education Center Li Dachao, Joint Association of University Faculty Kang Xuanyi, Joint Association of Secondary School Faculty Xu Zeyi, Shen Bao Ma Chonggan, Shi Shi Xin Bao Jiang Xiangze, Xinwen Bao Hou Xuanqing, Min Bao Zhu Yixin, Continental Bao Xu Xingchu, Pudong Middle School Xu Xizhi, Municipal Education Association Hou Zeyu, Jinan University Yang Yufen, Shang Bao Wu Zhimin, Datong Meng Shouchun, Beixin Xu Wancheng, Zhonghua Lufei, etc., and over three hundred students including Liu Liangman, Zhu Ruhua, and Feng Xigeng, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Proceedings of the Meeting <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>At 4:00 PM, the Public Security Bureau Military Band played music to open the meeting. Mayor Wu Tiecheng served as Chairman, with Zhu Shaoping and Hu Qibing as the chief hosts for foreign guests, and Wu Deyin as the chief host for students. Huang Jingwan, Xu Wancheng, Wu Baojin, Hua Xin'an, Hu Yunxing, Yang Yufen, Kang Xuanyi, and over twenty others served as hosts. First, Chairman Mayor Wu delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches from Kong Xiangxi, Li Zhaohuan, Zhang Shouyong, Wang Xiaolai, and Cao Yunxiang. Then, student representative Liu Liangzhan from Jiaotong University gave a response speech. Tea and snacks were served, followed by entertainment and photography before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Speech by Mayor Wu <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>In his opening speech, Chairman Mayor Wu Tiecheng stated that today, over thirty cultural organizations are sending off the students who are going abroad to study. These thirty-odd organizations include the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, the World Chinese Students' Federation, Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Tongji University, Shanghai Business College, Fudan University, Guanghua University, Shanghai Art College, Pudong Middle School, Qixiu Girls' School, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shi Shi Xin Bao, Continental Bao, Da Wan Bao, Chen Bao, Min Bao, Zhonghua Daily, China Weekly Review, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Vocational Education Society, Tsinghua Alumni Association, Chinese-American Cooperation Association, International Affairs Research Association, Joint Association of University Faculty, Joint Association of Secondary School Faculty, Commercial Press, China Publishing House, World Book Company, Beixin Book Company, and Datong Book Company. Now that you are about to leave the motherland and go abroad to study, I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the thirty-two cultural organizations and the citizens of Shanghai, to share a few words with you as parting words. The significance of sending you off this year is greater than in previous years. This year, the hopes of the people of the whole country for you are also deeper than in previous years, because China has faced many national crises in recent years. The more national crises there are, the heavier the responsibility of the people becomes. People think more about the future of the country. Thinking about the future of the country, they naturally think about the youth, because whether today we can save the country from its difficulties and make the nation turn from weak to strong depends entirely on the youth of the whole country, especially the youth who have received higher education. China is in a serious position today, all because in the past, education was not universal, not applicable, and not sound, resulting in the people's actions not being unified and consistent. In the current situation of educational decline and cultural immaturity, building a new China is an urgent task. But building a new China must have considerable talent for construction. Here, we cannot help but hope for the youth, especially the youth who go abroad to seek higher learning. I would like to represent the thirty-odd cultural organizations and the citizens in holding endless hopes for you who are going abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Speech by Kong Xiangxi <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Central Bank President Kong Xiangxi stated that the purpose of your going abroad is to seek knowledge and to seek foreign knowledge. But seeking knowledge must be seeking practical knowledge to achieve your goal. Foreign knowledge has good and bad aspects. We should certainly learn the good aspects, but not all good knowledge is necessarily practical. We should choose the knowledge that is relevant to practice in order to be of benefit to our country, so that the purpose of going abroad to study is not in vain. At the same time, while you are abroad, you must be real Chinese people. China has its own geography, history, and culture. We must always show that we are Chinese people and not be Westernized in order to win honor for our motherland. Today, we are holding a send-off gathering. In the future, when you have completed your studies and returned to the country, we will hold a grand welcome gathering. Its significance will be even greater than today.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Speech by Li Zhaohuan <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong University President Li Zhaohuan stated that I was also a Chinese student who went abroad to study more than ten years ago, but since returning to the country, our country has not been on track in terms of politics, education, and all other construction undertakings. As for what the results will be when you go abroad, it all depends on how much progress China can make after you return in the future. China currently needs construction. The elements of construction are capital and talent. It goes without saying that China lacks capital, but there is also a lack of talent for construction. You are going abroad to study, hoping to seek knowledge to build China. There are thirty-two organizations at today's send-off gathering, and in the future, there may be more than three hundred at the welcome gathering.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Speech by Zhang Shouyong <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua University President Zhang Shouyong stated that I am very honored to represent Guanghua University and the Joint Association of University Faculty in attending this send-off gathering for students going abroad. I have never been abroad in my life and have very little knowledge, but my son has been abroad and I have sent him off, but it was not as lively and interesting as today. Speaking of Chinese education, it has indeed made great progress in recent years, but unfortunately, it cannot be connected one by one like building a house. The responsibility for this connection rests entirely on the students who are going abroad today. Therefore, I believe that we should take the essence of European and American countries and use it to build China, not just copy them. If we do this, whether it is national politics or the great masses of society, there will be a way. Your trip is extremely important. I hope you will not fail to make it a success.

<h3 id="e175">Speech by Wang Xiaolai <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai stated that today I received invitations from two places, one from the German warship Longhao and one from here. But after my personal consideration, I felt that sending off the students going abroad was more important than visiting the Longhao, because the two hundred-odd of you going abroad are equivalent to two hundred-odd Longhao cruisers going abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Speech by Cao Yunxiang <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Former Tsinghua University President Cao Yunxiang stated that China's first student to go abroad was Rong Hong, who went abroad in 1854, more than eighty years ago. At that time, no one sent him off. Currently, people generally say that students who have studied abroad cannot do anything. In fact, Rong Hong, the first student to study abroad, has already done a great job, such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Telegraph Administration, which were all Mr. Rong's undertakings. Secondly, the first batch of people to go abroad consisted of four people, two of whom were Ms. Song Qingling and Ms. Song Meiling. These two students can also be considered great people. There was also Mr. Chen Jintao, who also went abroad in this batch. Mr. Chen returned from studying abroad and became a successful economist. He once said that it is very easy to write economic papers, but it is impossible to solve China's major problems by relying on papers. It can be seen that China's problems are great, not that students who have studied abroad have failed. China's first student to study abroad, Rong Hong, said that the solution to China's problems requires the people to be aware, so I hope that you will also make the people aware and bring benefits to the people in the future, and continue the spirit of the first student to study abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Response Speech by Liu Liangzhan <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>After the speeches, student representative Liu Liangzhan gave a response speech, saying that I would like to represent all the students who are going abroad and express our sincere gratitude to the gentlemen who have come to the meeting. Listening to your teachings has been of great benefit and inspiration. I also feel that the mission is heavy and I am as if standing on the edge of a deep abyss. However, I will be able to understand the meaning of the elders' encouragement and dare not be idle or negligent, so as not to disappoint your high hopes. As for the achievements of students who have studied abroad, there are sometimes bad ones. This is a personal problem for the students themselves and is not a problem with the study abroad system itself. Among those who are going abroad this time, there are many wealthy people, but there are also many poor people. I dare to believe that those who are going abroad this time will be able to compete with each other and do their best to learn more about China's lack of knowledge, discuss more books that are not easily seen in China, and do more construction work that China urgently needs, so that we can be of benefit to China in any way possible.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Final Entertainment <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>After the speeches from all walks of life, tea and snacks were served. Finally, for entertainment, Miss Shen Yuanyu, a talented student from the Shanghai Art College and daughter of Mr. Shen Erchang, was specially invited to sing a Peking opera piece, "The Goddess Scattering Flowers," which was round and jade-like, melodious and pleasing to the ear.

<p>—The Conference Will Be Postponed to June 9th to 17th—</p>
<p>—The Proposal to Hire Neutral Countries as Referees Was Not Approved—</p>
<p>(Manila News) The Board of Directors of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association held its annual meeting on July 28th. In addition to re-electing the directors of the association, there were several important resolutions regarding the Far Eastern Games next year, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e186">Cancellation of the Overall Championship <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese proposal to cancel the overall championship of the Far Eastern Games, it was agreed that each sport competition should have a championship, like the International Olympic Games.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Postponement of the Conference Date <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese proposal to postpone the date of the Far Eastern Games next year, it was resolved to change the date from May 12th to 19th to June 9th to 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Neutral Referees <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese proposal to hire neutral referees for the Far Eastern Games next year, such as having Chinese referees for matches between Japan and the Philippines, this proposal was not agreed upon. The Board of Directors believes that the established custom of the Far Eastern Games is that the host country has the right to choose officials and referees when the games are held in that country, so there is no reason to change it at present. However, the Board of Directors resolved to accommodate as many officials and referees from participating countries as possible in the next year's games. (July 29th)</p>
<p>National Games Registration Begins</p>
<h3 id="e189">Deadline is September 25th <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Water and Transportation Issues at the Venue Are Being Prepared</p>
<p>The National Games are approaching. Since the Organizing Committee took over the venue, the General Affairs Group has moved to the Central Stadium to work. The venue has already begun to be repaired, but because the building has been around for two years, the collapsed ground has been soaked by rainwater, making it uneven, so the repair work is quite time-consuming. The issues of funding, transportation, and water for the Games have been completely resolved. The Organizing Committee held group meetings overnight to discuss registration, tickets, and the reduction of train fares by the railway department. In addition to the reduction of train fares by the railway department, which has been reported in this newspaper, the rest are reported as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e190">Ticket Prices Determined <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>For the temporary transportation of the Games, the Organizing Committee originally planned to rent 50 cars for athletes and spectators to ride. It is now learned that the committee has repeatedly discussed this and decided to add 20 more cars because 50 cars are not enough. They are currently in negotiations with the highway bureaus of various provinces and cities. It is estimated that each car can carry 30 people, rotating between the First Plaza of Nanjing Xin Jiekou and the Central Stadium. As for the ticket price for spectators, it has been decided to sell each ticket for 2 jiao. Volunteers and staff will be assigned a number of cars for special transportation, free of charge. There are no restrictions on private vehicles. Ticket sales for spectators will be from October 10th to 20th, and for athletes and staff from October 5th to 22nd or 23rd. The wages for drivers and gasoline will be provided by the Games, estimated to cost more than 35,000 yuan. In order to welcome spectators to visit the venue, the price of admission tickets has been decided to be 1 jiao each, according to the practice of the 20th National Games.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Water for the Venue Has Also Been Resolved <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>When the venue was taken over, the members of the Organizing Committee inspected the site and found that the water problem was the most difficult. There were only five artesian wells in Dongchang, and according to the calculation of 30 gallons of water needed per day, the amount of water was far from enough. After several discussions, it was decided to ask the Department of Health to test the water in the Erdao Ditch pond in front of the Mausoleum. If it was drinkable, it would be taken. The test results showed that it could be used as long as it was disinfected. Therefore, it was decided to connect water pipes from the pond to the venue and draw water from the artesian wells to the pond. After disinfection, it would be poured into the swimming pool for storage. Sand filters would also be set up to filter the disinfected water and inject it into the reservoir for use. However, the reservoir is very small, so it is planned to set up another 200 water tanks for adjustment. As for the water fee, it has been decided to pay 1 yuan per 1,000 gallons, and it is estimated that 5,000 yuan will be paid to the Mausoleum Management Committee for water fees during the Games.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Sending Letters to Provinces and Cities to Register <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The competition rules have been drafted by each group and are being reviewed by the committee. Regarding the registration date for athletes from various provinces and cities, the committee has not set a uniform date due to the different distances. Once the rules have been reviewed, they will be sent to the education bureaus of each province and city along with the registration form. Registration must be completed by September 25th. After September 25th, athletes from all over the country can set off for Beijing. Regarding the accommodation of the athletes, in addition to the dormitories built in the Central Stadium for the athletes, in order to facilitate the dietary habits of the athletes from all over the country, the committee has hired cooks to be contracted directly by the athletes. The dietary expenses will be borne by the provinces and cities themselves. According to Kang Youyi, the funds raised by various provinces and cities for the Games will be allocated to the athletes' meals.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Appropriately Increase Funding for the Games <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing, 13th) Wang Shijie and Zhu Minyi have contacted Wang several times to request that he find a way to meet the approved budget according to Jiang’s reply. Wang has agreed to appropriately increase the funding. The committee has been reviewing the budgets of various groups in recent days to determine the final budget. In addition to the revenue from tickets, estimated at more than 20,000 yuan, at least 90,000 yuan is needed. In order to save money, they are trying to reduce the expenses wherever possible.</p>

<p>Shanghai had already won the championship with a score of 3-0 in the first two days of the competition, so the outcome of yesterday's match had no impact on the championship. The singles match between Machida and Faber started at 3 pm. The two players were evenly matched. In the usual situation, Machida defeated Faber 3-1.</p>
<h3 id="e196">First Set <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>

<h3 id="e197">Second Set <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Machida was forced to lose two games, but Machida won the next three games in a row. Faber seemed tired. Unexpectedly, Faber also added three games in a short time, taking the lead with a score of 5-3. Faber served to win the tenth game, making it 6-4. Faber won.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Third Set <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Machida's balls went out of bounds many times, and Faber won two consecutive "smooth fours". Then he won three consecutive games, almost the same as the second set. However, Faber lost one game after winning the sixth game. Machida lost the eighth game on serve. Afterwards, Machida's courage increased greatly, and his shots became fierce, changing his gentle state, and he won again with a score of 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Fourth Set <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Machida created an equal endgame in a winning situation, but finally won 7-5. When Machida led 4-2, Faber served in the seventh game and lost 15-40 (1-3), but he was still able to turn the tide and win a game. Machida fought to win the eighth game, taking a 5-3 lead, but in two games, Machida had gains and losses, and was finally won by Faber in a row, making it 5-5. Machida launched another fierce attack, making Faber unable to return, and took the lead again with a game. The next game became a smooth four, and Machida ended with a score of 7-5.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Yesterday's Doubles Match <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>After the singles match, the final doubles match began immediately. It was already past five o'clock. Shanghai's Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang defeated Lun Qiang and Jie Hansheng in straight sets, which was very easy.</p>
<h3 id="e201">First Set <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Lun Qiang served first. Without fierce fighting, he lost a game. Qiu Feihai attacked the boundary near the net, making his opponents sigh helplessly, unable to grip the ball. Jiang Daozhang's net interception had both merits and demerits. The game was not tense. Qiu Wang won the first five games and won the first set with a score of 6-1.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Second Set <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>If the first set was in the initial test period, the situation in the second set was slightly tense. Both sides used close combat, and the performance gradually became exciting. After Shanghai won the first game, Tianjin returned two games, but then Shanghai won four consecutive games, and victory with a score of 5-2 was again in the hands of Qiu Jiang. Although the opponents won two games, they finally lost again with a score of 4-6.</p>

<p>Shanghai won first, Tianjin quickly won a game. After Qiu Feihai served to win the third game, in the fourth game, the two sides entered a melee of close combat. The back and forth of one ball was more than ten times, and all were rescued with difficulty. The spectators applauded a lot. However, the Tianjin team only had the ability to parry and no ability to counterattack. Shanghai took the lead again with a score of 5-1, and then each added a game to end.</p>

<h3 id="e214">A Discussion of Jiao Yitang's Letter to the Nation Regarding the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations (Continued) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao says, "From the perspective of us third parties, Western medicine has its strengths and weaknesses, and national medicine has its weaknesses and strengths." Mr. Jiao, as the head of the National Medicine Hall, suddenly wants to speak from a third-party position, claiming to have an objective perspective. I'm afraid that's not right. I believe that there isn't a single thing in the world that is completely harmful or completely useless. As the saying goes, "Every advantage has a disadvantage." For example, poison can cure diseases, licorice can harmonize, and dog excrement and sparrow droppings can soften leather. Even disease-causing microorganisms can be used to treat severe illnesses. A type of deformed syphilis in the nervous system, called "general paresis," is now known to be treatable with malaria parasites. Therefore, something considered harmful and useless from one perspective may be beneficial when viewed from another. However, the two effects, benefit and harm, cannot coexist. Benefits and harms vary in magnitude, and selection is required. The ancients said it well, "Choose the greater benefit and the lesser harm." They also said, "Even small skills have their merits, but excessive pursuit leads to stagnation, so a gentleman does not engage in them." Therefore, the principle of being a person is to understand distinctions, recognize the importance of things, and then have the ability to make choices and decisions, so that one can move towards the goal without going backward. Otherwise, listening to the arguments of both sides, each with their own reasons, one cannot make a judgment and wanders aimlessly, resulting in the tragic outcome of "hesitation leads to failure, and straying leads to nowhere." Such a person is called a mediocre person; if they become a doctor, they are called a quack; if they become an official, they are called a mediocre official in the era of gentlemen, but now they can only be called a useless bureaucrat. Mediocre people cause trouble, quack doctors kill people, and useless bureaucrats ruin the country!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao says, "The strengths of Western medicine lie in the progress of material civilization, the use of excellent equipment, precise diagnosis, and strict disinfection." The strengths of Western medicine are indeed limited to these few, but these strengths are acknowledged by Mr. Jiao. It can also be inferred that "national medicine lacks the progress of material civilization, lacks the use of excellent equipment, lacks precise diagnosis, and lacks strict disinfection." Mr. Jiao certainly cannot deny these shortcomings of national medicine. I believe that these strengths and weaknesses can determine the fate of medicine and are already of great significance. Mr. Jiao! Fellow countrymen! Please use a calm mind and a fair heart to listen to what I have to say. Firstly, material civilization: the object of medicine is the human body. Humans are a type of object in nature. Their sight, hearing, speech, actions, perception, thought, emotion, and various life phenomena all have definite structures and rules. At a minimum, doctors should understand human anatomy and physiology before further exploring the truth of diseases and determining treatment plans. If this basic knowledge is not yet possessed, wanting to organize various theories and study advanced topics is too far off. How can these doctors without a solid foundation truthfully treat diseases? Therefore, following Mr. Jiao's command to "explore from a theoretical perspective," the claims of national medicine to have cured certain diseases, aside from the large part that is exaggerated propaganda, are all within the scope of the four words "fortunate coincidence" mentioned in Zhang Huang's books. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach?" What theories and techniques can be discussed? It's all false!</p>
<p>Secondly, the use of equipment: In simple terms, the invention of microorganisms was only possible with the microscope. Advances in abdominal surgery, allowing for direct observation of living organs, were only possible with anesthesia. Accurate diagnosis of internal problems and treatment of several malignant and stubborn tumors and skin diseases were only possible with X-rays. The excellence of equipment has a great relationship with the progress of medicine as a whole. Mr. Jiao should remember the two maxims "A craftsman who wants to do his job well must first sharpen his tools" and also that in our country, doctors have been called "craftsmen" since ancient times, with the terms "superior craftsman" and "inferior craftsman." If the equipment is not excellent, then the medical craftsman cannot do his job well. Therefore, the inability of national medicine to do its job well is an undeniable fact. In other words, the inadequacy of national medicine techniques is an inescapable causal relationship and an unshakeable conclusion.</p>
<p>Thirdly, precise diagnosis: Doctors should naturally diagnose accurately to prescribe medication accurately. Mr. Jiao has already acknowledged that national medicine lacks precise diagnosis. However, this matter is a major key to theory and practice in medicine, not only affecting the individual who is sick. Accurate diagnosis allows for recognition of the true nature of the disease, allowing one to apply theory to deal with it. If the disease is misidentified, it will lead to a great deviation. For example, mistaking a stroke for phlegm and desperately treating it with phlegm-removing medication. If it happens to get better, people who don't understand theory will say that the disease was indeed phlegm, and that the medication was accurate, resulting in good results. In fact, from a theoretical perspective, a stroke is certainly not phlegm but a cerebral hemorrhage. Using phlegm-removing methods to treat a cerebral hemorrhage is obviously irrelevant, and using phlegm medication to treat a cerebral hemorrhage is obviously the wrong medicine. Moreover, whether their so-called phlegm-removing medication actually removes phlegm is also completely without basis. In short, it's all nonsense fabricated out of thin air. They insist that a stroke is phlegm, insist that the treatment method is for phlegm, and insist that the medication used is phlegm medication. When the disease slightly improves, they insist that it is their technique. I remember that Lu Wenshu of the Han Dynasty wrote a memorial to the emperor advocating leniency in punishment. The most poignant part of it said: "People naturally enjoy life when they are at peace and think of death when they are in pain. Under torture, they cannot obtain what they seek. Therefore, prisoners who cannot bear the pain will embellish their words to please the interrogators. Officials who benefit from this will guide them to clarify the details. Afraid of rejection from the emperor, they will forge evidence to perfect the case. Once the case is successfully framed, even if Gao Yao hears it, he would still think that the death penalty is insufficient punishment. Why? Because many people are involved in forging the evidence, and the charges are clearly presented." Aren't national doctors forging diseases and embellishing treatments in the same way? Therefore, the Mountain and Sea Classic and the Book of Burial say: "If mountains and rivers could speak, grave diggers would have nothing to eat. If internal organs could speak, doctors would be pale with fear." Relying on the fact that internal organs cannot speak, national doctors forcibly connect pulse diagnosis, disease causes, symptom analysis, and treatment into one, to spread falsehoods and deceive the public, perpetuating errors from ancient times to the present. They not only lack the understanding of the principles for recognizing the true nature of diseases, but they also lack this kind of thinking. Therefore, because they cannot recognize the true nature of diseases, they also cannot judge whether the treatment techniques are correct or reasonable. They also cannot verify the actual effects of the medication. It all becomes a rigid situation, empty and without any practical effort, so our national medicine will never progress. This is the harmful consequence of inaccurate diagnosis for the development of medicine itself. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Administration of Medicine and Pharmaceuticals</p>
<p>Section Three: Recent Government Orders</p>
<p>Regarding foreign drug merchants, although the Ministry of Health has ordered them to register their products, how many have complied with the order to this day? Aren't inferior foreign drugs still being sold freely? Moreover, what can be done when Koreans naturalize as Chinese citizens, hang up American business signs, and sell German drugs? Although the regulations on the management of narcotics are being revised, they cannot be implemented smoothly. Customs only searches for them as contraband, and pharmacies sell these goods on the market. This is because there is no thorough solution. So it seems laughable. (As for the Tianjin Health Bureau, it even banned the sale of lactose in order to crack down on the so-called "white flour" poison – saying that lactose is a necessary ingredient for making white flour. Such a foot-binding government order is even more ridiculous.)</p>
<p>The above-mentioned government orders are mostly national affairs, but Shanghai is most deeply affected by them. As for the winter of the seventeenth year, it was precisely the era when the Ministry of Health had not yet been established, and health bureaus or public security bureaus in various regions each governed themselves. The Shanghai Medical Association once requested the authorities to postpone registration until the Medical Practitioners Law was promulgated. However, there was no way to remedy it at the time. Various places had already started one after another. Shanghai was particularly fragmented due to the concession relationship, and registration was not comprehensive. Soon, the Ministry of Health canceled the validity of registration in various places and uniformly changed to ministry registration. Not everyone necessarily obtained ministry licenses. Those who acted as overseas Chinese-style doctors only began to obtain concession licenses after being cracked down on by the French Concession and the Public Concession in December of the nineteenth year and May of the twentieth year. However, the orders were not consistent, which naturally led to the malpractice of obtaining concession licenses that did not comply with the ministry's regulations. Moreover, although the concessions have regulations for cracking down, it is difficult to implement the procedures for cracking down. How often have concession police intervened in the business of doctors? Therefore, when the ministry ordered everyone to obtain ministry licenses in the eighteenth year, someone requested the health bureau to crack down on unlicensed doctors. As a result, they only received a written reply to handle it accordingly. And last year, someone wanted to ask the concession authorities to crack down on those unlicensed quacks who misled the public with exaggerations. The concession authorities actually replied that there was no provision in Chinese law stating, "Who is allowed to practice medicine? Who is not allowed to practice medicine?" Since the courts could not easily intervene, how could the police power be enforced? In this light, the Executive Yuan's insistence on strict qualifications for doctors was merely a pretentious aristocratic claim. The medical and pharmaceutical concepts of the public were very thin.</p>
<p>In the winter of the seventeenth year, the Shanghai Health Bureau also issued a government order stating, "Chinese medicine practitioners shall not use Western medicine, and Western medicine practitioners shall not use Chinese medicine," forcibly conflating medicine and pharmaceuticals and leaving academic theory behind. The Health Bureau probably thought it was a clever way to prevent business disputes. (The central authorities have some people who accuse modern medicine of rejecting old medicine and old medicine of criticizing new medicine as business disputes, but we modern medicine have never admitted it.) They considered themselves as impartial and appropriate as Chen Ping dividing meat. Or perhaps it was a passive policy to prevent old medicine from misusing blood serums and other products. However, the promulgation of this order provoked criticism from the modern medicine community and resentment from those in old medicine who wanted to innovate. Another government order was that the Health Bureau, acting on the advice of the party department, wanted to limit the consultation fees of private practitioners in the city. In reality, the consultation fees of private practitioners are secretly judged by the natural forces of society. If the price is high and the skill is poor, they will inevitably be eliminated. As for the poor and sick, even consultation fees of fifty cents to one dollar are still unaffordable. How can the government order private practitioners to provide free consultations when it does not run hospitals? Therefore, this order was also a dead letter.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Medical Association voluntarily solicited more than fifty members to provide free consultations for one hour in different districts every day. Consultation vouchers were printed and could be obtained from the association. This can be considered a small obligation of the association to society. In summary, past medical and pharmaceutical government orders have been sometimes strict and sometimes lenient, sometimes able to be implemented and sometimes unable to be implemented but forcefully attempted, leading to a hectic and chaotic situation. This is all due to (A) a portion of the health authorities recognizing the idealized high standards of pure European and American systems; (B) a few central committee members favoring old medicine based on personal feelings and individual beliefs; (C) instigation by party departments or business associations; (D) obstruction by foreigners in the concessions. These various reasons have created many gaps that can be exploited during the repeated changes in these attempted government orders. Therefore, in this era of economic depression and declining people's livelihood, a large number of speculators have infiltrated the medical and pharmaceutical industries. This is what Wang Qizhang called "unjustified desires and opportunistic gains." I still remember when the second chapter of this article was published, I said that the Western Medicine Association was forced out by laws and regulations and that the association had no restrictions, making it easy for mixed elements to enter – which caused quite a stir among the Western Medicine Association. Now that I have clarified the facts, the Western Medicine Association can probably understand that this phenomenon does indeed hinder the overall development of modern medicine. (This is what a member of the Western Medicine Association told me.) And it will not be a misunderstanding that I have any intention of slandering it. (End of this chapter)</p>
<h3 id="e217">Several Important Discoveries and Inventions in the Process of New Medicine Development (7) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>(V) Organotherapy and Secretion Theory</p>
<p>Humans have believed since ancient times that certain organs in the body have certain functions. This belief is not limited to primitive peoples. Even ancient and modern civilized peoples have not been without it, because they believed that courage was related to the heart. Therefore, warriors of savage tribes believed that eating the hearts of enemies could increase their courage. From this psychology, it is easy to infer that eating animal livers is effective for human liver diseases. In the writings of Celsus and Dioscorides, we find that they advocated using various animal organs to treat diseases of these organs in humans. For example, because foxes can run long distances at high speeds, they believed that fox lungs could be effective for shortness of breath. Similarly, they believed that rabbit brain could treat tremors and calf stomach could treat stomach diseases. This method continued until relatively recent times. However, in the early nineteenth century, these drugs were almost not included in pharmacopoeias. Later, after our knowledge of gastric physiology improved, we were actually able to extract gastrin from pig stomachs and make artificial gastric juice, which was used for indigestion.</p>
<p>Similar preparations have also been made from the pancreas. This pancreatic juice is also widely used for several indigestion conditions and has even been used to pre-digest food. This pancreatic juice is usually taken from the pancreas of pigs. Part of the food has been digested by the action of pancreatic juice, so people with stomach diseases can eat this food that has been treated with pancreatic juice without overloading their digestive system. Milk can usually be treated in this way. To explain in detail, it is to add some artificial pancreatic juice to a certain amount of milk, store the mixed liquid at the same temperature as body temperature, and after a certain period of time, allow the enzymes in the pancreatic juice to act on the components of the milk, just like the action of pancreatic juice on milk in the human body, and then use it as a drink. This method does have value, but it also has limitations. Usually, it should not be pre-digested for too long, otherwise this food may inevitably lose its deliciousness and will not be enough to be eaten. The principles of the above-mentioned application of gastric juice and pancreatic juice are relatively simple. In addition, we have more complicated methods for applying organs to treat diseases, which are specially called organotherapy.</p>
<p>Most of the secretions of the glandular organs in the body are mostly injected into the body cavity through ducts to manage various beneficial effects. For example, the secretion of the salivary glands often assists the digestion of food in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>However, the secretions of some glandular organs are not injected into the body cavity through ducts, but directly enter the circulatory system through lymphatic vessels or blood vessels and circulate throughout the body to manage various special effects. This secretion is particularly called endocrine secretion, which is very important in modern medicine. According to recent research, it is known that some diseases are caused by the deficiency or changes of certain endocrine organs. The first endocrine organ discovered was the thyroid gland in front of the neck.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Random Notes After Diagnosis <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>Introduction in lieu of a preface</p>
<p>I am a doctor, and diagnosing illnesses is my duty. I should focus on my work and fulfill my duties, so why should I write this random notes? But you must know that we are in a transitional era in China, and all social phenomena are in contradictions and abnormalities, and medical affairs cannot escape this general rule. You must know that practicing medicine in a foreign society only requires doctors to do their best, use their keen eyes and wisdom to diagnose disease symptoms; apply their broad knowledge and medical rules; and they can fulfill their duties. But in Chinese society, the contradictions and abnormalities of medical affairs are encountered almost every day. When we encounter these contradictions and abnormalities, sometimes a strange feeling of oppression and uprightness arises in our chest, and we cannot help but release it. Sometimes infinite pity and sorrow are reflected in our eyes, and we cannot help but give advice. Sometimes, we even hold back the humorous nature in our noses and cannot help but play with a blunt pen to relieve the fatigue of our work. This is the origin of "Random Notes After Diagnosis."</p>
<p>On the Shanghai Bund, in the concession area, after all, it is the source of international cooperation. Two or three years ago, I went with a few friends to Wusong to breathe the fresh air by the sea. We heard two people pointing and gesturing in front of a large house, saying, "What is this strange place? On the one hand, it hangs the signboard of the Chinese National Medical College, and on the other hand, it hangs the signboard of the kerosene king." "What is that? The government of the Republic of China, in the Republic of China, runs the National University of the Republic of China, and it has to rely on foreigners to donate a piece of land to build a school base. Do you understand this contradictory fact?" "I understand. Because if you want the children of China to learn the medicine of universal harmony, you must first have them learn the example of international cooperation." Now I look at the Japanese, who hung up the signboard of Manchukuo in the three eastern provinces and want the Manchus to be puppets, pulling the strings behind them. It turns out that they have guessed the spirit of international cooperation and universal harmony of our noble countrymen. They say that I run the South Manchuria Medical College to educate Chinese children and that I run the Dalian Medical Staff to rescue Chinese coolies. Long live international cooperation! Long live universal harmony! Once, at a friend's house, I heard a Mr. Wang say, "There is a wealthy man with five or sixty thousand strings of cash at home. He suffered a mild stroke, and his right hand and right foot were not moving well. He asked a foreign doctor from a certain sanatorium to see him, and the doctor said that his blood pressure was too high and that he should have a bloodletting. After agreeing on a bloodletting fee of five hundred taels, he asked the doctor to carry it out. Unexpectedly, too much blood was let out. At first, his face turned pale, then he twitched, and finally, he died. The foreign doctor still said some sarcastic remarks, saying, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, put him on the soil, and he will be fine if he is not given anything to eat for two days and nights." One asked Mr. Wang in surprise, "How much blood was let out in the end?" He said, "About three or four pounds." I said, "He should have died. The amount of blood in a person is about one-twelfth or one-thirteenth of their body weight. Acute blood loss of more than one-fifth is life-threatening. Assuming that the wealthy man weighed one hundred and twenty or thirty pounds, his blood volume would be about ten pounds. Letting out three or four pounds would be fatal!" I also asked him how much the bloodletting fee was. He said that five hundred taels were paid. Originally, Chinese people living in the concession area, even if they were injured, would only obediently pay the injury fee to foreigners. We often hear that the appendicitis surgery fee in a certain foreign hospital is one thousand taels, the X-ray fee is seven hundred taels, and the radium treatment fee is two thousand taels. We also often hear people who pay the money say that the foreign hospital is really good and clean, and it should be expensive. We also often hear people say that medical expenses are really expensive now, four cents for a prescription of winter frost leaves and summer bitter herbs, and two yuan for a consultation with Dr. Zhao or Dr. Qian. Comparing these two statements,</p>
<p>You must know that people with the root of universal harmony, who live in the concession area, should believe in foreign goods. What is so strange about that! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e219">Talking About Sequels <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>It is said that there are as many as seven or eight types of sequels to Dream of the Red Chamber, but none of them are worth reading. The ancient saying "to add a dog's tail to a sable coat" is indeed something to sigh about.</p>
<p>Sequels are not easy to write. A complete work must already have formed a world of its own, with a unique and complete system. To write a sequel, one must first understand everything in that world in the original work and see the inevitable development and trends that will be produced, and then unfold a new situation based on this. In this way, the sequel and the original can be connected and become a real sequel. Writing randomly without understanding it is nonsense.</p>
<p>So sequels are very difficult to write, at least no easier than original works that break new ground, but there are many people who write sequels without knowing this difficulty. For every small famous work that can be profitable, there are always more than one person writing a sequel. They are not writing sequels, but using the name to make a profit. Their purpose is only to borrow the already famous book title to make it easier to appeal and make money. These kinds of sequels should be overthrown.</p>
<p>There are also people who genuinely write sequels, either continuing the unfinished work of a friend or because they have been greatly moved by reading a work and feel that they must express themselves, but very few people do well. Because before the sequel, there is already an established and complete world, and everything must start from there. It is definitely not the same as writing chapter novels, continuing chapter after chapter. Therefore, if you take the attitude of writing a chapter novel to write a sequel, you will definitely fail. Therefore, a work that is very good when read as a chapter novel, for example, with rich content, many twists and turns in the situation, beautiful words, and truly moving writing, becomes a good work in itself, but if it is a sequel to a certain book instead of starting from scratch, it may not be good when viewed as a sequel, because sequels have other main points, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>It is difficult to write sequels to novels, and we can always forgive if they are not written well, but those that are very clever when not seen as sequels but become unrecognizable when seen as sequels are really a bit funny.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Uselessness of Pessimism <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— A Traveler from隼</p>
<p>Among elegant scholars, there are indeed some who are particularly adept at shedding tears. They say that because of the chaos in the Chinese literary scene in recent years, it's like warlords carving up territory, and they can't help but cry "Alas!" But especially lament the slander.</p>
<p>In reality, the era of writing to be "stored in famous mountains" is gone, and once there's a "literary scene," there's bound to be struggle, even to the point of insults and slander. The late Ming Dynasty is too far away, so let's not mention it; in the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Shizhai and Yuan Zicai, Li Yuchun and Zhao Huishu were as incompatible as fire and water. Closer to our time, the disputes between "Min Bao" and "Xinmin Congbao," and between the "New Youth" faction and some other faction, were also extremely fierce. In the beginning, didn't they also make outsiders shake their heads and sigh? However, once the victor is clear and the era recedes into the distance, the blood of battle is washed clean by the rain, and later generations believe that the literary scene of the past was peaceful. It's the same in foreign countries. We now mostly only know that Ibsen and Hauptmann were outstanding literary figures, but when their works were first performed, people were arrested and fought in the theaters. Detailed literary histories even record illustrations of such fights.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether in China or abroad, ancient or modern, the literary scene is always chaotic, making elegant scholars "pessimistic." But in the end, many so-called literary figures and writings will certainly perish, and only those that deserve to exist will ultimately survive, proving that the literary scene is still a clean place. What adds to the chaos are some pessimists who, without investigation or criticism, use the argument that "that is also a right and wrong, this is also a right and wrong" to denigrate all authors as "birds of a feather." In this way, the chaos will never end. However, the world is not all like that; there will certainly be clear distinctions between right and wrong. Let us think about it: Lin Qinnan's attacks on the novels of the literary revolution didn't last long. Where are they now?</p>
<p>Only the recent slander seems to be a rather outstanding trick, but in reality, it is not more severe than in ancient times. The evidence is the anecdotes of the literary inquisition in the early Qing Dynasty. Moreover, those who engage in such tricks are not entirely literary figures. Nine out of ten are just hanging up a signboard without any goods to sell, and can only turn into a dark shop, selling human meat buns like petty thieves. Even if there are occasionally people who have once dabbled in writing, at this time they are precisely revealing their true colors, confessing their own decline. The literary scene will not be confused by this; on the contrary, it will become clearer and more distinct.</p>
<p>History never regresses, and there is no need to be pessimistic about the literary scene. Pessimism arises from standing outside the situation, not distinguishing right from wrong, and yet insisting on caring about the literary scene, or perhaps from sitting in a declining camp oneself.</p>

<p>My previous work, "Kong Yiji," was included in the 　庐絮语. I said that this method of tracing red characters existed before the Tang and Song dynasties. Recently, I received from Mr. Ruozhang a copy of his book, "A Superficial Investigation of the Origins of Vulgar Customs," containing the entry "Shang Da Ren," which further proves that my previous statement was not a mistake. The summary is as follows: Liang Zhangju's "Sequel to Rambling Talks" quotes the "Transmission of the Lamp" as saying, "Someone asked Venerable Chen, 'What is the teaching of an era?' Chen said, 'Shang da ren, qiu yi yi.'" The "Wudeng Huiyuan" records that Guo Gongfu visited Baiyun, who said, "Last night I composed a eulogy to the mountains on my pillow to thank the great Confucian Guo Gongfu, namely, 'Shang da ren, qiu yi yi, hua san qian, qi shi shi. Er xiao sheng, ba jiu zi, jia zuo ren, ke zhi li ye.'" Gongfu initially doubted, but later heard a child reciting it and understood. According to this, the phrase already existed in the Tang and Song dynasties. Zhu Zhishan's "Vulgar Talks" explains its meaning as, "This is Kongzi's letter to his father. 'Shang da ren' is one sentence. 'Kong' is one sentence, meaning Kongzi referring to himself. 'Yi yi hua san qian qi shi shi er' is one sentence, saying that the scholar he has transformed into is of such a number. 'Xiao sheng ba jiu zi jia' is one sentence, 'ba jiu' meaning seventy-two, saying that among the three thousand people, seventy-two are even better. 'Zuo ren ke zhi li' is another sentence, 'zuo' meaning 'is,' benevolence and propriety being used together, seventy characters doing good is benevolence, its propriety is knowable." I do not know what the life of teachers in the Tang and Song dynasties was like. However, judging from this primer for beginners, it can be seen that their learning was simple and crude, not far from the Kong Yiji described by Mr. Lu Xun. In the popular dramas performed by farmers in my hometown, there is a type called Zhang Hutu, one topic being "Mr. Zhang Demands School Fees." This also describes the clumsy literati of the old era. Zhang Hutu is also of the Kong Yiji type. Zhang Hutu describes his teacher life as follows:</p>
<p>First, I bid farewell to Confucius, and on both sides, I bid farewell to the worthy men. Teaching is a difficult thing, the most worthless of people, the stinking scholar. Teaching is difficult, truly difficult, blue clothes sitting, white back sitting crooked. Teaching until the tenth month is full, good students will return the money. Bad students will slander, saying that the teacher is playing with the students. After reading the Four Books and Five Classics, a belly full of writing is remembered in the heart. Although I am not a reading seed, I am still teaching students with a book. In the first month, it is the New Year, every household goes to welcome the lanterns. The student invites me to watch the lanterns, afraid of disgracing my literary style. In the second month, it is the Flower Festival, the student invites me to teach at the school. He asks how much the tuition is, I say one hundred is not too much, eighty is not too little, half a liter of rice I also want.</p>
<p>In the third month, it is Qingming, every household goes to the ancestral tombs. The student invites me to go on an outing, pumpkin stew with meat awaits the teacher. In the fourth month, mid-fourth month, the student invites me to dinner. Wine, meat, fish, and shrimp are eaten in one meal, also sending a few salted duck eggs. In the fifth month, it is the Dragon Boat Festival, the teacher returns to his hometown. Every student sends festival tea, giving me a few old cucumbers. In the sixth month, it is the dog days, teaching makes me sweat profusely. The tuition is only sixty coins, but the teacher must teach for a year. In the seventh month, the seventh day of the seventh month, teaching has only one brush. The Five Classics and Four Books I do not know, the Three Character Classic I am the first. In the eighth month, it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, the teacher has reached the end. Every student pays their respects with the festival, each bringing a mooncake. This drama uses the mouth of the confused Mr. Zhang to write out the false elegance, poverty, and bitter life of the teacher. The tune is humorous and interesting, also giving much sympathy to those village teachers. The teachers are close to the farmers, so in the farmers' dramas, they are not completely antagonistic figures. When the National Revolutionary Army first rose, the peasant associations in various places all had elementary school teachers participating, also because elementary school teachers were closest to the farmers, both belonging to the dominated class, and their economic status was also somewhat equivalent. The era of Zhang Hutu and Kong Yiji-like teachers has long passed, today's elementary school teachers should know how to encourage themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e222">On Children's Education <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yun</p>
<p>Having worked as an elementary school teacher for over a year, I really dare not say that I have any insights into children's education. No, when I think of children, when I think of these many relatively pure people, I cannot help but feel deeply guilty. In the present day, when everything is commodified, not to mention the children who cannot enter school, even those who are fortunate enough to enter school are pitifully subjected to education that cannot be told to outsiders. The other day, I saw several teachers discussing the compilation of textbooks, but dead textbooks need living people to teach them. What actually cultivates children's character and increases their knowledge is still the elementary school teacher. How to make children automatically study, and use books to develop their understanding by drawing parallels and making inferences, completely depends on whether the teacher can become one with the children. The teacher should put all their heart and mind into the children, and should have a naive childlike heart and a sharp mind, so that the children can happily follow you without realizing it. The education of love is very, very important in elementary school. However, in today's new schools, there is no so-called corporal punishment, but the situation where students become dull and wooden as soon as they see the teacher is still everywhere. The reason is of course that the teachers are too teacher-like, punishing students by making them write repeatedly or stand in the corner at the slightest movement, so that the children cannot help but tremble at the sight of them. However, elementary school teachers have their own difficulties in being like this. Speaking of the life of an elementary school teacher, its tedium and poverty are almost universally known. A five-month contract is enough to make them worry once at the end of each semester, and the hourly wage on weekdays makes them tremble and dare not be absent, even if they are sick, they endure it and go to class. Otherwise, excluding Sundays in a month, if they take a few more sick days, they will have to tighten their belts. Elementary school teachers who are forced to sell their time and labor have no choice but to be stingy with the time that has not been sold in order to make up for the lack of livelihood. As a result, the children are perfunctorily treated. In addition to the regular lessons in the textbooks, they can no longer get much more from the teachers, because the extra energy and time that the teachers spend is unpaid, they cannot talk about education on an empty stomach, and they cannot educate other people's children while their own children have no food to eat. Because of the need to finish those textbooks by the end of the semester, they have no choice but to put pressure on the children like debt collectors. As a result, cowardly and opportunistic qualities are cultivated among the children, and "perfunctory treatment from top to bottom" has become the state of education today. For the sake of humanity, we must not let our children continue to receive that kind of incomprehensible education, but to have good education, we must have good teachers, and to have good teachers, we must first ensure that they have some security in their lives. But in the current social system, is there anyone who can devote themselves to a certain career without having to worry about their livelihood?</p>

<p>— Jun Guo Sun</p>
<p>"There was no discussion, because everyone didn't know to look for the old boss. Later, Chunshan ran to the factory and heard the situation, deeply regretting that he hadn't asked carefully at the beginning. So we sent some people to look around Chongqing Road, and also sent someone to report the news."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lao Qiu," said Botang, then, as if questioning himself, "Is there something new on Chongqing Road again!"</p>
<p>At this time, he raised his head and looked at the crowd, but no one could be sure. He continued, saying:</p>
<p>"Having a place means that at least Grandpa hasn't gone there yet... But, this was a few minutes ago, now we have to quickly think of another way..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, a servant brought in a business card, saying that a guest insisted on coming in to meet him. Botang frowned and took the business card, seeing the three large characters "Shi Shouzi Chun..." among the two lines of small characters.</p>
<p>"This friend really seems to be deliberately trying to amuse me when I'm so busy... Since he's here, let him in!"</p>
<p>After the servant went out, Peiqi had already seen Shouzi Chun's address and phone number on the business card, Chongqing Road ×× Lane ×× Number and phone number ××, and quickly said to Botang:</p>
<p>"This person lives on Chongqing Road. If he is also here to give us information, then it couldn't be more convenient!"</p>
<p>"How could there be such a thing!" said Botang, "You're always living in an ivory tower..."</p>
<p>He was about to say more, but everyone had already seen the servant lead in a short, stocky man in a Western suit. His face was red, round, and flat, wearing a pair of slightly round, black-rimmed glasses, which made his round eyes and fat nose even more in harmony with his overall demeanor. He saw that there were several people in the dining hall, so he first greeted everyone generally, and then exchanged pleasantries with Botang and stated his purpose:</p>
<p>"Tonight's dinner, please be sure to grace us with your presence."</p>
<p>"Brother, you're going to so much trouble, I really don't deserve it."</p>
<p>"Please be sure to come to my humble abode for a visit."</p>
<p>"I really don't deserve it. I received your call earlier and should have replied immediately, but now that you've come to invite me in person, I'm truly very sorry..." "We're all familiar people, Brother Botang, why do you say such things! I've been trying to call more than ten times but couldn't get through, so I came in person."</p>
<p>"In principle, Brother Zichun, I really should obey your command, but it just so happens that there's some family business at home today, important family business, so I really can't spare the time. I can only appreciate your invitation in my heart."</p>

<h3 id="e224">Some Thoughts on the Rural Revival Problem Shishihao <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, the revival of rural areas has been emphasized by both the government and the public. It is claimed that the country is based on agriculture and that farmers account for more than 85% of the total population, yet rural areas have been declining year by year and are on the verge of collapse. This is truly a major concern for the national economy and the people's livelihood. More than twenty types of theories and proposals have been put forward to trace the reasons for this and to plan for the future. However, the implications of economic problems are like the pyramids of Egypt. The more numerous the lowest layer, the simpler and more acute the center of gravity of the highest layer must be. Although the rural problem can be analyzed in detail, there must also be a comprehensive reason for grasping the key points. To make a comprehensive observation, one must first have the following premises. Modern economy is also called world transportation economy. The circulation of goods and finance has hardly any national boundaries to divide. Therefore, the rise and fall of prices and the level of interest rates tend to be the same all over the world. This is what is called free competition of economy. Therefore, although there are differences in the production cost of goods, the rise and fall of prices must be balanced, and no one city or industry can monopolize for a long time. This situation is most evident in the products of small production businesses. The selling price of products is almost entirely controlled by the market. The individual cost is negligible. If the scale of the business is large, the output of the product is huge. Since it has considerable control over the supply and demand of the market, it also has relatively autonomous control over the rise and fall of prices. Monopoly businesses, trust organizations, and state-run trade in Soviet Russia are all good examples of this. This is the first premise that those who observe production businesses should understand. A production business is an economic business. The principle of economics says that the greatest effect should be obtained with the least labor and expense. This is also true of production businesses. Therefore, labor and expenses must be minimized, and selling prices must be maximized. Only when labor and expenses are small can costs be light, and when costs are light, selling prices may be lower than market prices. Therefore, although selling prices are reduced, the business can still prosper day by day. Conversely, if costs are higher than those of general competitors, and the selling price of the product cannot be free from the control of the market price, then those who only cover their expenses in normal times will be profitable for their competitors; those who can still break even when prices fall will not be able to avoid losing money. Since the profits of the business are lagging behind step by step, decline and collapse are inevitable. The rise and fall of all production businesses are generally viewed in this way. This is the second premise that those who observe production businesses should understand.</p>
<p>The cost of a product has direct and indirect distinctions. The proportion of indirect costs allocated to products must be lower for large-scale producers than for small-scale producers. Indirect costs are especially so; such as management fees; such as marketing fees, etc., the larger the output, the more economical the allocation rate. Even extending to direct costs, large-scale use is also more economical than small-scale use. Moreover, the so-called economy here is not only the quality and quantity of use. The purchase price of materials required for various costs, the wages of labor, and the interest on silver, large-scale businesses are also more economical than small-scale businesses. The lower product costs of business organizations such as trusts, cartels, etc., are all due to this. This is the third premise that those who observe production businesses should understand.</p>
<p>The production of goods has the distinction between manual system and machine system. The manual system requires human labor everywhere, and human labor must have a considerable cost of living. Although productivity is smaller, the cost of human labor cannot be too low. If it is too low, it will not be enough to maintain its life, and people will abandon this work. The machine system can save human labor, often with two or three people managing a machine, and the productivity is enough to match dozens to hundreds of people. Therefore, although its production is larger, the proportion of expenses allocated to producers is smaller. Human labor expenses are originally the main part of the cost of a product. Machine production can save human labor, and its cost is naturally lower than that of the manual system. This is the fourth premise that those who observe production businesses should understand.</p>
<p>Judging from the above four premises, it can be seen that in the current world economic trend, only large-scale production and machine production can survive. The larger the scale of production and the more extensive the use of machines, the more economical the cost and the more applicable the economic principle. In the near future, business people can occupy an advantage in the market, and in the long run, social people's livelihood should not be difficult to benefit from. The university has a cloud, "Those who give birth are many," which is the production method that conforms to economic principles.</p>
<p>○○○○○</p>
<p>Our country's rural areas are indeed the production business of agricultural products. In this world traffic economy, since we cannot close ourselves off, we cannot but be subject to the economic principles of agriculture in various countries of the world. Now let us see how the control it receives compares with that of the general agriculture of the world?</p>
<p>The mass production system is a characteristic of general production organizations since the industrial revolution. Industry is no exception. Just like Nungye, it also has this tendency. The large-scale cultivation in the United States is known to everyone. Since 1929, Soviet Russia has implemented a policy of collective production in agriculture. Therefore, the amount of mineral products has made the most long-term progress. In our country, although there are large landlords, there are still many small tenant farmers. Those with cultivated land of less than ten mu almost account for half of the total number of farmers. Speaking of the size of the production organization, our country's rural areas are inherently backward.</p>
<p>The use of the machine system in the production business, the industry is actually the first, followed by agriculture. England, the United States, and Soviet Russia are all its authors. According to British statistics, the latest mechanized steel plow can cultivate about 25 to 40 acres per day, compared with manual labor, the speed is truly incalculable. Our country's rural areas have always relied on the manual system for their farming methods. Although livestock are used for plowing, the speed of work is not enough to look forward to the back of the machine system. Speaking of production technology, our country's rural areas are also backward.</p>
<p>In terms of the organization and technology of production, the production labor of our country's agricultural products is probably more than that of various countries. However, its prices cannot but be subject to the control of the world market. Large labor costs and small gains are what is feared by economic principles. Although it is said that the living standard of farmers is lower than that of various countries. However, the necessary cost of living must be sought to be maintained. This kind of living cost is also part of the cost, then the cost must not be as low as those who use machines. The fact that our country's agriculture cannot compete with various countries in the world is also due to economic principles. When the selling price is not enough to cover the cost, and the income is not enough to cover the expenses, the cash outflow of the rural areas, the equipment of agriculture is even more humble. Land prices are getting lower and lower, and wasteland is increasing day by day. The hidden treasures are getting more and more, the production is getting less and less, the refugees are getting more and more, and the bandits are becoming more and more prosperous. All the phenomena of rural misery arise one after another. Recently, it is not only declining, it is in danger of collapsing. The source of poverty is just losing money. Losing money is what is greatly feared by production businesses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the high cost of our country's agricultural products is not only due to the improper production organization and technology. The heavy indirect costs are also sufficient to cause it. Such as especially heavy taxes, the exploitation of individual rents, and the heavy erosion of intermediaries in sales, none of them is not enough to increase the cost and reduce the net profit. The former is due to special reasons, and the latter two are still the malpractices caused by small production organizations. The backward production organization and production technology are truly the major reasons for the rural loss of money. According to the above-mentioned arguments, in order to revive rural areas, two major plans should be implemented in the agricultural business itself:</p>
<p>(1) Nationalization of land, private ownership of land, unequal distribution, and the annexation of the powerful. In densely populated areas, farmers cannot obtain their land. In sparsely populated areas, the benefits of the land cannot be fully utilized. There are many obstacles to the promotion of large production organizations. Moreover, in private ownership, landlords can sit back and eat, and tenants bear the burden of rent. The former is wasteful in terms of social economy, and the latter is to increase the indirect costs of agricultural products. Both are sufficient to hinder the proper development of people's livelihood. Therefore, it should now be taken over by the state. The state should divide the land according to the current situation of farmers. Farmers' cultivated land is not limited to the present. The wasteland in the northwest can also be used. Farmers' production organizations are not based on each household as a unit. Hundreds of thousands of households can also cultivate and live together. In short, the land should be used as a war position in the society, making it a vital land, and making it a land for large-scale production organizations. This is the meaning of nationalization of land</p>
<p>(2) The use of machines is enough to increase productivity, which has been commonly seen since the industrial revolution. Farming relies on the power of human and animal, it takes a long time and costs a lot of labor. It is not in line with economic principles. Large-scale use of machines is indispensable. Machines of course also have costs, and their costs must be allocated to agricultural products. However, compared with the cost of humans and animals, it must be economical. Then it can be confirmed in the manual industry and the machine-made industry. However, the more widely used machines are used for farming, the more economical the cost. Moreover, those who do not have a wide range of cultivated land and thick financial resources are not sufficient to widely use machines. Therefore, it is only applicable under large production organizations. Furthermore, large production organizations can only save costs and exert the characteristics of large production by using machines. Then, land nationalization and machine utilization have an inseparable relationship. This is the meaning of machine utilization.</p>
<p>If the two methods on the right can be implemented, the loss of money in agriculture will be transformed. It can at least be effective in reviving rural areas. If agriculture can be improved, the social economy will surely prosper. Then the people will be at peace and the country will be stable, and everything can be revived. Not only can taxes be reduced, but the social order can be rectified. Even natural disasters can be prevented. What is the purpose of engaging in designing trivial details in the problem of rural revival?</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that large-scale production and machine production can revive rural areas is not only limited to the main industry of agricultural products. Even extending to various side industries, it is also the same. Such as handicrafts, such as animal husbandry, if they can follow this rule, the method of improvement. The cost can be reduced, and the production can also be improved. In terms of the economic principles of production businesses, large-scale production and machine production, although they also have their drawbacks, are ultimately more beneficial and less harmful. Moreover, the whole world is like this, but I alone deny it. Therefore, if we do not rush to promote it, it will not be enough to save the country.</p>
<p>Someone said that the area of agricultural land in our country is about 155.8 million mu, and on average, each person only gets 5 mu. If large-scale production is implemented, how will the agricultural land be insufficient for distribution? Moreover, the farmers are already in pain. If machine production is implemented to seize human labor, how will the number of unemployed farmers increase? The answer is that there is no need to worry about this. According to economic principles, the harvest of production should be sought to be more, but the workers participating in a certain production do not need to be many. The investment of labor should only be for production, and the production business is not limited to one end. Then, for the current plan, it is only necessary to use the cultivable area to engage in production with the most economical production methods. If the people have surplus labor, there are many other production businesses. It can be used to exert the production capacity of the whole people. What is the purpose of cutting off the feet to fit the shoes?</p>
<h3 id="e225">Currency and Price Charter in the Dauraixi Plan <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>In the previous article "The Most Serious Currency Issue in the Current Stage of the World Economic Panic", we roughly discussed the relationship between world currency issues and the world economic panic. Because many economists believe that the decline in prices is the fundamental reason for the downturn in all industries, and to restore world prosperity, it is necessary to artificially raise prices first; to raise prices, it is necessary to artificially devalue the currency. The current economic policy of the United States is the result of the advocacy of this type of economist. Then, regardless of whether the phenomenon of low currency value and high prices in the United States is temporary, and regardless of whether the United States can restore temporary prosperity as a result, the necessity of discussing this issue is undoubtedly clear.</p>
<p>I remember that when the London Conference was held, its agenda included the following six key points:</p>
<p>1.  Restoring the gold standard; 2. Preventing the decline in prices; 3. Abolishing all means of managing exchange rates; 4. Eliminating special obstacles to international commerce, such as prohibitions and quotas; 5. Establishing an agreement to reduce and stabilize tariffs; 6. Obtaining the unanimous agreement of various governments to ensure the organization of production and the mutual exchange of various important products.</p>
<p>Judging from the past facts of currency chaos, it is very clear that the first point is the theme of the above six points. We have already said that the stability of currency prices, although not the only condition for restoring the mutual circulation of capital and commodities of various countries, is a necessary condition. However, if the gold standard is not restored, then the abolition of means of managing exchange rates, the elimination of special commercial obstacles, and the stability of tariff policies are all nonsense.</p>
<p>The agenda of the London Conference seems to be very in line with the needs of the times. But we must pay attention to the fact that this is not the achievement of the London Conference. A year ago, when the preparatory work for the London Conference had just begun, many experts had unanimously recognized that this currency issue should be in the most important position, because they believed that currency was the key to all prosperity. They proposed to use a method of reorganizing currency to end the economic panic. Experts have long criticized such one-sided and narrow-minded views as absurd, and there is no need for us to explain them again. A year ago, the currency issue was originally in a secondary position. Unfortunately, since the beginning of 1933, especially since the devaluation of the US dollar, this issue has accidentally aroused special attention from the world and has been regarded as the most important issue. If it is said that the proposals of the London Conference are in line with the needs of the times, this is not based on the farsightedness of the conference's initiators, but rather it can be said that a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of rice!</p>
<p>The experts of the preparatory committee of the London Conference first expressed their attention to the second point on the agenda, namely the issue of preventing the decline in prices. At the same time, some relatively level-headed experts struggled to prevent the conference from aiming solely at raising prices. Because there are some people—this is very painful, but it is an unavoidable fact—who can read and write, can count and calculate, but when it comes to political economy, they are very much like our ancestors, like those ancestors who blindly believed that the sun revolved around the earth, and actually imagined that rising prices could make the world prosperous. I remember Marx saying these words in "The Poverty of Philosophy" (Misère de la philosophie): "When the weather is fine, we can see many people walking in the countryside. Mr. Proudhon wants everyone to go for a walk in order to guarantee that the weather will be fine." Really, that's right, these expert gentlemen, they originally wanted people to go for a walk to restore the fine weather! What could be more foolish than this! We have already anticipated that people who generally advocate using artificial methods to raise prices will definitely do their best at the London Conference, hoping that the conference can decide on this method to restore world prosperity. However, it would not be fair for us to criticize all of these people uniformly, because there are both fetishists and opportunistic people who change their course with the wind. Some of them have a relatively realistic attitude towards the price issue. They believe that even if there is international consensus and a common agreement to devalue all currencies, it may not necessarily be able to revive world prosperity. Let us now study the more realistic new plan of Dauraixi (M. Francis Delaisi).</p>
<p>The proposition of this new plan has long been endorsed by most American economists, and recently, it has been supported by the French economist Dauraixi. He first published his proposal in the journal La République. His concept is different from that of the traveling quacks who generally believe that raising prices can restore prosperity. Based on his article published in La République, we will briefly explain his new plan below:</p>
<p>1.  Eliminate various restrictions on currency; 2. Liberate frozen credit; 3. Unify the conversion of foreign debt conditions, using a weaker currency for payment; 4. Eliminate the policy of exchange rate dumping; 5. Abolish commodity quotas, even if they cannot be abolished altogether, at least they must be partially abolished, because such quotas often hinder the outflow of currency; if they are abolished, the factors that hinder currency balance can be reduced; 6. Promote the mutual circulation of capital between countries and make it possible to borrow and invest in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Mr. Dauraixi declared that the new plan he proposed, although it cannot ensure the solution of all the problems of the economic panic, in order to pave the way, it is necessary to first restore the free circulation of capital. Then, we can talk about reducing tariffs and eliminating obstacles to commodity circulation. Mr. Dauraixi has explained his plan in detail as follows:</p>
<p>"There is currently a very difficult reason to solve. Generally, creditors of industrial and commercial enterprises and national creditors all demand more than they have lent. They always believe that they have this sacred right to demand that debtors fulfill the obligations of the total amount of debt on the bill, but estimating the price of these amounts in terms of purchasing power is far greater than the price of the amount borrowed. This entanglement between creditors and debtors originated after the decline in prices in 1929; because since 1929, the global wholesale price index has decreased by an average of about 36%. This means that the purchasing power of money has increased by an average of about 55%. Reducing the price of money has no other meaning than to restore the purchasing power of money to that of 1929, only to enable the numbers in the hands of creditors who receive debts to only obtain the same purchasing power as the amount they lent out. If a miner in California could buy four kilos and eighty-four of goods with one ounce of gold in 1929, today he can buy seven kilos and fifty-seven of goods with the same amount of gold! Therefore, the so-called 'expansion of the purchasing power of gold' has been discovered in the world! The price of gold is much higher than it was four years ago. It is this unreasonable 'expansion' that we are trying to remedy! What should we do? The London Conference should make the governments of all countries decide to simultaneously reduce the amount of gold contained in the currency by 36%. What results can such a unified action achieve? We can say that the gold reserves of all central banks can immediately increase to 55% of the current real price; therefore, the following results can be obtained: (A) Many central banks, whose reserves are only 20% to 25% today, can immediately exceed the legal limits and increase to 30% to 40%, and can further increase the possibility of redeeming their issued banknotes. (B) Banks that are relatively short of gold can also bring them closer to these legal limits, and based on the increase in the amount of currency, they can gradually recover their business. (C) Wealthy banks can lend their surplus gold to the state as a 'public fund' to restore the free circulation of capital and ensure the mutual free action between gold standard countries."</p>
<p>The above words are the content and reasons of Dauraixi's new plan. He seems very cautious and careful, and does not aim at exaggeration. The goals he hopes to achieve are also very limited. This is certainly better than the general quack-style economists who specialize in exaggerating their own glory. However, we must also point out Mr. Dauraixi's mistakes for everyone's research.</p>
<p>Gold is too expensive today, which is the starting point of Dauraixi's theory. Today, to buy the same amount of goods as four years ago, you don't need as much gold as you did four years ago. Dauraixi's argument is indeed an undeniable fact. But unfortunately, it is a huge question whether the devaluation of all currencies (i.e., reducing the gold content in the currency) can remedy this price drop panic.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of currency devaluation and reducing the gold content in the currency? Suppose one ounce of gold (about thirty grams) is minted into two coins: each coin contains fifteen grams of gold. According to Dauraixi's proposal, if we reduce the price of the currency by 36% (approximately one-third of the original price), we must cut one-third of the weight of the original currency. After that, the one ounce of gold used to mint two coins can be minted into three coins: each coin will replace the weight of fifteen grams with a weight of ten grams. Although the currency changes its price in this way, the gold mine owner in California can still continue to buy seven kilos and fifty-seven of goods with one ounce of gold. There is absolutely no change in this matter. Gold is still as expensive as before! However, this one ounce of gold has changed from two fifteen-gram coins to three ten-gram coins. If this lightweight currency and the previous weight currency use the same name, for example, the British gold is still called the pound, and the French currency is still called the franc, then this currency conversion movement will only increase the nominal price by 50%. For example, to buy the same amount of goods, you used to need two coins, but after the currency is devalued by one-third, you need three coins; three coins replace two coins, six coins replace four coins, nine coins replace six coins, and so on. The nominal price has indeed increased by 50%; but after that, the amount of gold contained in three coins is exactly the same as that of the current two coins, so what change has occurred in the relationship between gold and commodities! Originally, there was no change at all! The gold mine owner in California, of course, buys four kilos and eighty-four of goods with two coins in 1933 as he did in 1929, but since his one ounce of gold is worth three coins, the third coin can still buy the remaining amount, and the result is that his one ounce of gold can still buy seven kilos and fifty-seven of goods!</p>
<p>Assuming that Dauraixi's plan can be implemented, can it really achieve the results he hopes for? Can the central banks of various countries really increase the currency price by 55% as a result? Of course, each coin has been cut off one-third of its gold, and the reserves of various central banks can certainly allow the minting of 55% more currency, or the issuance of 55% more supplementary banknotes. If the central banks do not issue supplementary banknotes, then the ratio of their reserves to the banknotes they issue is certainly better than before. But can they check the issuance of banknotes? If it is said that to buy the same amount of goods as before, it is necessary to increase from two coins to three coins, then in order to ensure the circulation of goods, it is necessary to issue more banknotes. Because to make the nominal price fit the amount of the new currency unit after weight reduction after the high rise, the circulating banknotes must also increase by 55%, and the reserves of each bank are still absolutely as insufficient as before. Based on this argument, we can say that points ABC in Dauraixi's conclusion cannot be established.</p>
<p>But the starting point of Dauraixi's theory also has its foothold within a considerable range. After the creditors receive the devalued currency, they can only buy two-thirds of the current goods, just like the same amount in 1929. The debts of industry and commerce can be reduced from this, and the capital of industry and commerce can also be relatively active from this. However, things are not as simple as this: on the one hand, such a reduction in burden may not necessarily increase production, and on the other hand, although the wage laborers who are weakening day by day due to unemployment panic have increased a little nominal wages, they lose more than they gain due to the high prices, and their pain is even worse than in the past; the purchasing power of wage laborers has not only not increased, but even decreased, and it is still a question whether the free circulation of goods and the suitability of production and consumption can be realized.</p>
<p>Currency devaluation is of no benefit to the majority of wage laborers. They have already suffered enough in the fierce waves of the economic panic. Dauraixi's currency devaluation plan does nominally raise prices, but the purchasing power of the majority of people still cannot increase. What remedial effect does this have on the panic of production stagnation and commodity accumulation! The only meaning of his plan is to reduce a little of the gold burden on debtors, especially to reduce the burden on European debtor countries for the United States.</p>
<p>We want to try to come up with a proposal to increase purchasing power at the London Conference, but the result is zero. We believe that the only way to remedy this panic of overproduction and insufficient consumption is to enable the working people to consume the goods they produce. This is the most reasonable remedy. But capital has its own logic, and its logic is based on profit. The main purpose of capitalists in producing various commodities is not to manufacture gifts for wage laborers, but to reap the highest profits! To increase the purchasing power of the masses, it is necessary to increase the wages of wage laborers, and if the wages of wage laborers are increased, it will inevitably lead to a decline in profits. This is ultimately unacceptable to the general capitalists. Therefore, the London Conference, this drama of imperialist infighting, this competition of financial capitalists, will never pay attention to the point of increasing the purchasing power of the masses—currency devaluation and rising prices, although they can superficially beautify and prosper for a while, are ultimately fleeting flowers and are not a fundamental solution to the world economic panic.</p>

<p>Encountered Many Obstacles in the Forward Process ▲</p>
<p>Last week, from August 7th to 12th, the Chinese Securities Exchange, according to the support of the people and the excellence of the environment, and after many days of depression in the previous week, had the possibility of progress. Because it had fallen for many consecutive days, it had been depressed for a long time, and the rebound caused by the reaction, so it was not difficult to break through the highest record of July 19th in a few days. However, because No. 46 in the financial sector continued to sell, it greatly suppressed the prosperous atmosphere of the bond market. Although it struggled, it finally could not rise due to excessive oppression. From this speculation, there should be a violent reaction soon, venting its depressed and rising spirit. Now, the past week will be described in its cliffs and sketches, for reference. On Monday, I observed Feng's telegram, obeying the government's conditions. The inspection suddenly turned downwards, and there was no problem. The recovery of the lost land in North China was also quite smooth. It happened that after many days of falling, and because only two sessions were done in the morning every day, the people unanimously looked high. In the first session, the various gangs entered the stomach extremely eagerly, and the North Gang also rose up to hedge. In one session, it suddenly rose by one or two yuan. The one-eight customs and the majority of September all found new high prices. The various prices in August were almost the same as the highest record on July 19th. Unexpectedly, from the closing of the market, No. 46 immediately sold at a high price, but although it slightly turned small, it still rose by several jiao to one yuan and seventy-eight jiao in one day. The popularity was still strong. On Tuesday, there was no change in the environment, and No. 46 sold even more fiercely. The North Gang saw the opportunity, and the shorts also temporarily waited and stopped hedging. The market price fell continuously for two sessions under high pressure. Financial short-term sales were even more, and the fall was the most severe. It actually fell by several jiao to one yuan and sixty-seven jiao in one day. After this blow, the popularity had dissipated. From Wednesday to Saturday, although the daily results still rose slightly by several jiao, its trend had become a weak and powerless image that would definitely return every time it rose. Because No. 46 still had a small number of sales every day, although the number of jiao on Saturday was extremely clear, it seemed to have nothing to do with the overall rise and fall. Looking at the overall trend of the week, although the rising wind was strong, the oppression was too heavy, so it could not develop. Therefore, the result was only better than the previous week by several jiao to one yuan and sixty-seven jiao. The total number of transactions was calculated to be 61.9693 million yuan, of which the spot was 19,300 yuan. The futures for the total salt tax was 21.53 million, the disarmament accounted for 7.07 million, the one-nine customs and good customs accounted for 5.62 million, the twenty-roll and twenty customs accounted for 12.01 million, the gold short-term accounted for 4.9 million, the whole sixty-nine six accounted for 6.9 million, the compilation inheritance accounted for 2.28 million, and the rest was only hundreds of thousands. Now, the results of the market price rise and fall are listed in a table to clarify,</p>

The market price of white japonica rice was similar to the previous day. The prices of inferior japonica rice and "Yang Du" sharp-grained rice were stable. The price of early rice was down by a small amount (10 cents). New "Ke Bu" sharp-grained rice and "Bian Yuan" rice prices showed a weakening trend. The sales of "Dong Xin" japonica rice were not good, and the price was down by a small amount (20 cents).

<h3 id="e231">On the Future of Female Intellectuals <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>A few days ago, this publication carried two articles about the future of intellectuals. In these two articles, the complaints of intellectuals were fully revealed. After reading them, one could not help but sigh deeply. Yes, in such a dark year, the so-called future of intellectuals is out of the question. The dead end of intellectuals is indeed a true and undeniable fact.</p>
<p>However, it suddenly occurred to me that the so-called "intellectuals" here should only refer to men, because I feel that at present, the future of female intellectuals is developing, and the future of female intellectuals is much brighter, at least more so than for "ill-fated" men. Just taking a general observation of the "Self-Employment Introduction" in this publication, women get more "responses" than men, while more men than women submit articles. From this intuitive observation, we can see that in real society, women have a better "fate" than men, or at least it can be said that it is easier for women to find a way out than for men. Therefore, the current "female intellectuals" do not have to "be nannies" as Bai Bijun said. And in fact, this is true: there are college graduates working as waiters; it seems that there are quite a few pulling rickshaws! But I have never heard of a "female intellectual" being a nanny.</p>
<p>Therefore, modern parents, even if they have several seven-foot "men of great talent," may only be able to watch them eat at home in dismay. On the contrary, if they have a beautiful daughter, the parents' "glory and wealth" is "guaranteed." From the results shown in today's society, the idea of "valuing daughters over sons" has undoubtedly become active in the minds of parents.</p>
<p>So someone will ask, what superior conditions do daughters have that make it so easy to find a "way out"? I can answer this directly: "The reason why women can easily find a job (a way out) is simply because they are women." This second "woman" is very difficult to understand. I cannot explain it in detail here. Readers can refer to the "vase" theory published in various newspapers one after another to understand. (The statements about "vases" published in newspapers can probably be compiled into a book.)</p>
<p>"Woman" can become a prerequisite for finding a way out, half due to "talent," and half due to her "intelligence." For example, if "talent" has a defect, she will "intelligently" climb into the rouge jar and somersault to make up for it. (Conversely, if "talent" has special advantages, she will naturally use various methods more cleverly to set it off.) This somersault can naturally open up a "way out"!</p>
<p>Although that's how it is, I can't help but worry about the "female intellectuals" somersaulting in the rouge jar, because if the "rouge-eating" guys disappear from society, even if you somersault a hundred times in the rouge jar, you won't find a "way out."</p>
<p>So, in the final analysis, the future of female intellectuals is really unreliable.</p>
<p>The fact that women seem to have a "way out" now is just a distorted manifestation of the deformed development of a capitalist society.</p>
<p>Male and female intellectuals, you have all reached a dead end. If you want to open up a bright future, use your "intelligence," no! Use your "rouge," no! Only use your "knowledge,"</p>
<p>Use your sweat and strength!</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Way Out for University Graduates <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Bai</p>
<p>Five university graduates sat in a narrow and unclean pavilion room discussing the problem of finding a way out that generally plagues modern youth. After talking back and forth, everyone deeply felt that there was no way out for them anywhere in the current society!</p>
<p>Mr. A, who had deeper knowledge and richer abilities, said angrily: The stuff I bought—knowledge—is not bad, but useless, just because the consumer base in today's society is too narrow, which puts us in a dead end.</p>
<p>Mr. B, who had richer social experience, said solemnly: However, the reason why the social consumption base is becoming increasingly narrow is not only due to the oversupply of university graduates, but also the inevitable result of everything in the current society being controlled by those who have no knowledge, academic scoundrels... If you don't believe what I say, then you only need to pay a little attention to the administrative personnel of the Nanjing government and other places. How many of them are university graduates? This can prove that what we say is reality.</p>
<p>Mr. C, who had been subjected to many social stimuli, said very negatively: In short, the characteristic of today's society is that there is no way forward and no way back. In my opinion, we should become monks! Because becoming a monk can not only avoid all the disturbances in the current society, but also live a leisurely and happy life!</p>
<p>Mr. D, who was not very talkative, stood up excitedly and said: I very much agree with Mr. C's opinion of becoming a monk, but I have a statement. If we become monks, we must have the spirit of Christians, that is, we should reform the characteristics of Chinese monks in the past who were scattered and disorganized, and make them organized. In the future, once we have an opportunity, we can lead them to reform Chinese society.</p>
<p>Mr. E, who had a better social science background, seemed to oppose but not oppose, and said with a happy face: I agree with Mr. D's spirit, but I do not agree with the object that Mr. D said—only going to the monk group to organize monks, that is to say, we should expand the spirit of transformation and construction a little, and anyone can be our target, as long as they have the same fate and consciousness as us. Everyone felt that Mr. E's opinion was more appropriate and meaningful, and they all agreed that what he said was the conclusion. At the same time, they also jointly said that they would continue to explore the "bright path" based on Mr. E's conclusion!</p>

<p>— Jie Xin</p>
<p>"God! Why are you so cruel! You took away my two children! My darling, my child, your mother is calling you so loudly, but you don't answer your mother? My darling, my..."</p>
<p>It was already midnight. A burst of wailing from the kitchen next door woke me up from my dream: followed by this set of painful and sad cries—it was a woman's voice.</p>
<p>That woman, as long as I am aware of her, a shadow of a middle-aged woman with a sharp face, thick lips, bare feet and slippers, long hair, and a button on her chest that is never fastened, who always laughs with a nasal voice when she speaks, will naturally and clearly emerge in my mind. In addition to a husband who spends all day hiding at home "lying on the opium bed" or "cleaning the opium pipe," taking "smoking opium" as a profession, there are also two children living with her—the older one died of dysentery not long ago; the younger one, probably also died in her crying.</p>
<p>The noise last night prevented me from falling asleep in the middle of the night; when dawn was approaching, I got a moment of peace and slept for a while. Probably around ten o'clock, I was still in a hazy and fluttering feeling when suddenly there was a deafening sound of firecrackers outside, which woke me up again. I thought, I don’t know where this dead child has been sent to. As a result, there were many people in the alley discussing it:</p>
<p>"This child was destined to die; how can poor people afford to raise children? Instead of letting the child live in misery, it's better to let this little life be destroyed!"</p>
<p>Another kind of echoing voice is like this: "Originally, this woman was too restless. It was her own fault! After her husband died, she should have taken her two children and lived a good life in widowhood. If she endured some hardship in the present, there would be a glimmer of hope that the children would grow up in the future, but she was unwilling to settle down and insisted on marrying someone else, and she happened to marry such a living treasure. Isn't this her own fault?!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..." They continued to express their opinions on "social customs" and "human hearts" with great enthusiasm, and the tone was extremely indignant and sighing. "Poor people should not have children," what a clever, simple and wonderful conclusion! "Settling down to widowhood" is such a beautiful and humorous deduction! But I didn't understand any of this. What existed in my mind was that humans and all other animals have the same life. They have to eat when they are hungry! Who said that one life has the right to exist and the other life should be destroyed?!...</p>

<h3 id="e234">The Future of the Countryside <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Ma</p>
<p>Many people, like the man of Qi worrying about the sky, are making a fuss about "the collapse of the countryside" and "the bankruptcy of the rural economy," but this is actually superficial talk. Some people with "profound knowledge" who understand the situation of the peasants even feel that the extravagant habits of the peasants need to be corrected. Moreover, as long as the rural areas of each province have a large sum of money for reform and revitalization, then in the near future, there is hope for the urbanization of the countryside. With beautiful flowers and brocades, and bright radiance, with great plans, there is no fear of not achieving great things. It all depends on human effort. Now, let's write down the methods to revive the countryside.</p>
<p>(1) Widen the field banks and pave asphalt roads to facilitate the driving of cars.</p>
<p>(2) Fill the river courses and install tap water to save the peasants the trouble of drawing water. And clean drinking water is beneficial to hygiene.</p>
<p>(3) Peasants should abandon the dim oil lamps and kerosene lamps and use electric lights in every household. (4) Build tall western-style houses and dance halls so that peasants can get proper entertainment.</p>
<p>(5) Establish hospitals to protect the lives of peasants and maintain the health of peasants.</p>
<p>(6) Open banks to facilitate peasant savings. (7) Improve the habit of thrift.</p>
<p>(8) Set up detectives to protect the countryside.</p>
<p>(9) Peasants should abandon carrying poles and avoid using sticks, and instead use new-style cargo trucks.</p>
<p>(10) Peasants should not be bareheaded and barefoot, but should dress neatly to enhance their appearance.</p>
<p>Clerk Communication</p>
<h3 id="e235">Each Gets What They Want <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The Editor:</p>
<p>Every time I read the clerk communication, I see that the answered matters are all detailed and clear, the guidance is well-directed, and the correction is reasonable; from this, it can be known that the editor is not afraid of trouble and has the intention of teaching people tirelessly. Now, I have a trivial matter, please ask you, I hope you will not refuse it.</p>
<p>My father had four brothers. When they separated, the second uncle moved out of the ancestral house, and the eldest and youngest shared an ancestral house. The eldest occupied the east side, and the youngest occupied the west side. The eldest had two sons, and the rooms on the east side were naturally divided between the eldest's two sons; but the eldest's second son had already sold all the rooms he had divided to the youngest. Now, the rooms that the eldest son has divided also want to be sold to the youngest. However, the youngest is short of cash and has no ability to buy them. The eldest and youngest are close relatives, so they proposed that the youngest exchange some good fields for the rooms of the eldest son, which is called exchanging property for property, and signing a mutual exchange contract. I don't know if this method is feasible in terms of legal custom. Please clarify and teach, I am very grateful. Zhao Xueyan bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The law stipulates that a person has the right to freely dispose of his real estate. The so-called disposal includes use, lease, mortgage, gift, transfer, and sale. Therefore, the youngest exchanging some good fields for the eldest son's real estate is of course a legal act. However, when signing the contract, it is also necessary to ask a witness to be present; afterwards, it is also necessary to assess the price, pay the deed tax, and transfer the household and grain. The closer the relatives, the more proper the procedures must be, so as to avoid disputes caused by doubts from future generations.</p>
<p>This matter is beneficial to both the eldest and youngest. The youngest has three-quarters of the entire house, so he must obtain this one-quarter; since the eldest needs money, a whole pond of good fields is of course easier to exchange than a tangled house; each gets what they want, which is a great suggestion.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(28) Third Concubine's Greed: Staring intensely at his retreating figure</p>
<p>After glaring at each other again, Meizi smiled, but Shi Qiao switched to a solemn, serious expression, clearly having made another decision in his heart. He said slowly:</p>
<p>"My dear Meizi, thank you for your encouragement!"</p>
<p>Meizi's face immediately fell, worried that something might have happened.</p>
<p>"Likhanov is waiting for you, go to sleep early." Shi Qiao said these words, clearly restraining his passionate emotions. But immediately, he hugged Meizi tightly, gave her a flurry of passionate kisses, and then pushed her away, asking her to go to sleep. Meizi stood reluctantly at the threshold for a long time, her expression carrying a kind of pious prayer.</p>
<p>After Meizi left, Shi Qiao closed the door and cleaned up his books and letters alone, deciding to leave here and start building a new environment, a new life. In the moment he was cleaning up his things, it was as if he was clearing up his entire life's muddled accounts. All past experiences, thoughts, and feelings came to his mind one by one, and then ended one by one. Then, a kind of childhood joy and youthful aspiration put a smile on his face, and in the smile appeared the heroic countenance of Zhou Shaoping, and that impassioned letter—yes, his words were absolutely right. Good, let all the past die. And look at tonight, the enthusiastic state of the masses, isn't it obvious that the spirit of the old nation is awakening from its yawn, no, waking up with a shout. Regardless of whether the news of Ishikawa's death is true or not, in any case, this enthusiastic situation has given everyone a firm belief in national revival.</p>
<p>As long as the people's hearts have not died completely, as long as history has not been completely corroded, it all depends on us burying our heads and working hard. Really, "Hook Nose" also believes this, "Japan is definitely not our enemy!" He thought, and the things were almost packed. The east was gradually showing a fish-belly color, and the window glass was reflecting a milky white. So he gently carried a few pieces of luggage downstairs to the courtyard steps, because he was afraid of waking Meizi, he wrote a short letter and sealed a month's rent inside, leaving it in the room. Goodbye, my dear Miss Meizi! he shouted in his heart, waving a flying kiss—ah, may my Meizi be happy, and one day gloriously return to her homeland, and that homeland is no longer a den of wolves! Goodbye, dear Meizi, sleep well, he went to the street corner to call for a rickshaw. The street trees on both sides gradually shone with verdant green in the dawn. Suddenly, a car came from the silent distance and stopped unexpectedly in front of him. A woman in bright clothes walked out of the car. This woman was the third concubine. She had the car stop because she saw Li Shi Qiao. Her expression was unusually hurried, but she forced a smile, and even from her slight frown, one could still see the cherry red on her lips. But this only disgusted Li Shi Qiao, and he stood far away without moving. The third concubine walked closer and said:</p>
<p>"Shi Qiao, where are you going so early!"</p>

<h3 id="e239">The Shadows of Stars (Part 2) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Su Xin</p>
<p>Their understudies are their formidable rivals</p>
<p>The company's tools for controlling stars</p>
<p>One day, a manager at MGM met a young man. Because he looked very much like Gary Cooper, he recruited him and signed a contract with him. He also changed his name for him. He was originally called Archie Leach, and his new name was Cary Grant, which was almost the same as Gary Cooper. The company often gave Cary Grant roles that were similar to Gary Cooper's. However, Gary Cooper was even more mischievous than the managers at the company. He also acted very carefully and cautiously. Whatever they told him to do, he did. This way, Cary Grant had no chance to steal his position.</p>
<p>Because using these "shadows" was a good way for companies to control their stars, not only Paramount or MGM used this method, but other film companies also followed suit. Warner Brothers also had two actors with similar names, faces, and personalities. One was Warner's star, William Powell; the other was Warren William. Once, Powell didn't like the script for "The Mouthpiece", so the company gave the role to William. Later, there was another script for "The Dark Horse" that Powell didn't want to do, so the company gave it to William again. Powell thought both of these plays were absolutely impossible to do well, but William did them just right, turning ordinary stories into brilliant films; his name became famous as a result. Powell had always been very self-important, but now, threatened by this "shadow," he didn't dare to be too reckless.</p>
<p>For the past few years, Paul Muni at Universal Studios has always been dissatisfied with the roles the company has given him. The company felt that he was becoming more and more difficult to control, so they found Kent Douglass, and signed a long-term contract with him. Kent has already proven his acting talent in "Waterloo Bridge" and "A House Divided", and is no less talented than Paul Muni. However, Kent is a stage actor, and he doesn't like making movies, so he left the film industry after his contract expired. But Paul Muni learned his lesson.</p>
<p>Robert Montgomery also has an understudy named Robert Young. He has also proven in films such as "The Merry Widow" that he is not only as elegant as Montgomery, but also natural in his attitude and skilled in his performance, and can completely replace Montgomery. At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, there is a Franchot Tone who can also completely replace Clark Gable, who is considered the epitome of masculinity. Clark Gable has been very temperamental lately, and the company feels that he is very difficult to control, but they feel more secure knowing that they have Franchot Tone as his understudy.</p>
<p>Fox is a bit behind in this regard. Charles Farrell left, and they still haven't found someone to replace him. Charles Morton originally had a lot of promise, but his performance was far from satisfactory. They found a Russell Gleason, wanting to use him as a shadow of James Dunn, but the experiment failed.</p>
<p>Ann Harding at RKO is also threatened by this shadow. This shadow is Julie Haydon, whose appearance is very similar to Ann Harding's. In "The Conquerors", Julie played Ann Harding's daughter, and the two were indistinguishable from each other. As for Greta Garbo, there are many good shadows, so there are many American Garbos and German Garbos. But until now, they have not been able to completely defeat this Swedish star. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e240">Review of "Yes, Mr. Brown" <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Novel subject matter, gorgeous performances,</p>
<p>A top-notch work in opera. - Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>First of all, we are pleased that this opera's subject matter is novel. It uses the theme of satirizing merchants who curry favor with authority. Although performed in the form of a comedy, the kind of situation that makes people laugh and cry is indeed something that makes us have to admire the author's success.</p>
<p>The branch manager, in order to win the favor of the head office's boss, in addition to instructing the store clerks to do their best to please him, also had his wife dress up and accompany him, and host a banquet. But the wife wanted to have her beloved dog accompany her, which was of course inappropriate, so she argued with her husband and angrily took her dog out. The boss suddenly arrived, and the manager had no choice but to temporarily replace his wife with a female secretary. So, although the boss loved the secretary's beauty, he could only leave lightly because she was an employee's wife. Unexpectedly, the wife suddenly returned home because all the theaters had refused to allow her to bring her dog inside. When she learned of this situation, she was very angry, and after her husband explained, she pretended to be the female secretary and appeared before the guest. The general manager then tried to please this fake secretary, and the wife deliberately acted coquettishly to retaliate against her husband. So the husband forced a smile, and it was neither laughing nor crying. Later, in dance halls and nightclubs, he came home drunk, and all the details were completely revealed. So the general manager left with his female secretary, completing the change of scene in the comedy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we believe that the success of this opera is definitely not just the gorgeous and perfect performance form, but the profound content of the play. When we read Chekhov's novels, we always feel a spicy bitterness revealed between the lines. Bernard Shaw's works, (Correction: Yesterday's review of "A Flower" in this publication had some errors due to the reporter not having a reference book at the time. The author, Ingland, is a famous director, and this film is his recent work, not his first time directing. We hereby make a correction.) also have the same style, even more sincere and delightful than the former. The so-called irony in laughter and scolding, this kind of laughing sorrow, is precisely where the greatness of the above-mentioned writers lies. Needless to say, literature occupies a major part in film art, so many comedies do not fail entirely because of the chaotic performance, but because the content is too empty, like wearing gorgeous clothes on a paper doll, and there is no guarantee of success. Therefore, the success of this film is determined by the fact that it has quite substantial content, making the play have the possibility of success. We see that although what is written here are some small family matters, the author's depth lies in being able to tightly grasp and fully develop these quite realistic small matters. It can be said that the ugliness of merchants in modern society is very realistically exposed.</p>
<p>The performance is also very consistent with the content. In particular, the form of comedy, and the fact that it is not exaggerated, is even more commendable. Some may say that the branch manager and the female secretary's stumbling steps on the stairs when they return drunk are too restricted by the rhythm of the music. However, this is a prejudice of those who are not accustomed to watching opera. On the contrary, this is precisely a successful scene in this opera. In "Millionaires," we see the same method being used, but because "Millionaires" does not have the unified and lively mood of this film, it is ignored. As for the entire performance, we not only acknowledge that the director has novel methods, but the most important thing is that the mood is not dull or loose. From beginning to end, people feel the sadness of life in loud laughter. In particular, the husband's attitude of watching his wife's intimate behavior in the arms of others, lowering his voice to comfort his wife for a dog but eventually breaking up, falling again and again while dancing in order to please the boss, and finally failing to gain the boss's favor—these, these, the main character Jacob Gannam is truly depicted with depth and detail. The other three supporting actors are also very appropriate.</p>
<p>In this film, we certainly cannot see the slightest bit of positivity, but the small citizen's deep resentment can always win our sympathy. Thus, we must admit that this is a fitting work by a progressive small-citizen artist.</p>
<p>Two Anecdotes by Tian Yi</p>
<h3 id="e241">Making Everyone Poor <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Tian Yi's previous films mostly had magnificent sets and costumes. Recently, because the subject matter of the scripts has been leaning towards rural areas, the sets and costumes in the films have also greatly changed. The most ridiculous thing is that several actresses, who are usually accustomed to wearing gorgeous clothes, once they change into the attire of rural women, look very peculiar. Like Chen Yumei in "Struggle" and "Auspicious Land," Yuan Meiyun and Wang Huijuan in "Catkins," and Hu Shan and Lu Lixia in "Drifting," and Shao Suxia and Lu Jianfen in "The Adventures of the Little Vagrant," the clothes they wear are, at best, a style of cloth clothing that is out of date. Some are even full of holes, tattered and unbearable. If they weren't filming, they would never put on such ragged clothes again. Hu Shan often said with a laugh, "Boss Shao's calculation is really clever. He thought of this kind of rural play because the cost of adding costumes was too high. Just a few old cloth clothes can save a costume fee, but it makes us all poor."</p>
<h3 id="e242">She's Feeding the Chickens Right Now <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Since Chen Yumei finished filming "Vitality" and "Struggle," she has been continuously starring in "Auspicious Land." Originally, filming in hot weather is the most distressing thing, but "Auspicious Land" has a lot of outdoor scenes, sometimes in Jiangwan, sometimes in the Lin Family Garden, sometimes in Sanlin Tang, rushing to and fro to film under the scorching sun, which is really a bit unbearable. Now that the outdoor scenes have been filmed, she can take a break, but since she is against dancing and doesn't like swimming, and it's too hot to play basketball or football, she has no way to pass the time, so she can only read novels or play chess with Shao Zuiweng's children. Yesterday, three female students went to visit Chen Yumei. She was wearing a set of black silk shirts and pants, with two short braids behind her head, feeding the little foreign chickens. Although these female students had seen Chen Yumei on the screen, they never expected her to be dressed like this, and thought she was a nanny from the Chen family. So they asked, "Is Miss Chen Yumei at home?" Chen Yumei smiled and said, "She is feeding the chickens right now. May I ask what you ladies need?" The female students felt that this was very humorous, and knowing that this person was Chen Yumei, they became embarrassed and quickly apologized, blaming themselves for not recognizing Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e243">My Thoughts on "The Light of Motherhood" <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Yu</p>
<p>Yes, domestic films are currently in their nascent stage and need our advocacy and support. However, merely empty praise and irrational adulation will only lead domestic films down the path of gradual degradation and decline.</p>
<p>Like the recent premiere of Lianhua's new film "The Light of Motherhood," many film critics have unanimously praised it as "great," "perfect," "ideologically sound," and "realistic." But where exactly is it great? Where is it sound? Not a single piece of clear evidence can be found in the film reviews, and not the slightest hint of it has been revealed in the film. The company's advertisements proclaim: (1) a deep and penetrating depiction of the greatness of motherhood; (2) a correct awareness of the vanity of women; (3) a severe rebuke to those who worship money; (4) a realistic and detailed exposure of male greed. But these are just claims in the advertisements. These are only very small depictions in the film. Especially the indication of motherhood, committed a serious mistake. Like Huiying is a representative of motherhood, she should show her courage and perseverance in all her expressions, and use an iron will to overcome all difficulties and doubts. Huiying loves her Xiaomei, but why doesn't she have any action to resist Xiaomei's marriage to Huang Shulin; motherly love is only allowing her daughter to develop a habit of vanity. Motherhood in 1933 is probably not so simple.</p>
<p>Secondly, what about Xiaomei's motherhood? Repenting of the past and serving the public. Is doing something in a nursery serving the public? Nurseries are places to take care of children for female workers, but the nursery in "The Light of Motherhood" is like a kindergarten, then Xiaomei, Huiying,... are only working for their own lives, and definitely not serving the public in the nursery. The picture only tells us this.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are too many coincidences. The chance encounter between Huiying's family and Hu at the concert, the chance that Xiaomei becomes a singer, the chance of a concert to raise funds for the nursery, the chance that Xiaomei marries Huang Shulin and has a daughter and leaves her husband, the chance that she is on stage singing and her little daughter dies, it is true that there is no story without coincidences. These places fully show how far-fetched the story is!</p>

<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Seymour was asking, "Is this the lady?" So Hedges introduced them. Hedges told her that he had already spoken to Seymour, and asked him to help her find some work to do. Seymour very politely and in detail asked her about all her previous experiences. She recited her resume again. Finally, Seymour told her that there was nothing for her to do right now. He asked her to leave her address so that he could contact her in the future. But Irene was unwilling to tell people the unappealing place she was currently living, so she only wrote her name, and said that she would be moving in a day or two, and that she could come again herself. So Hedges led her away. She insisted on going inside to say goodbye to Easton. She told Easton that if Rita Vernon's performance was not satisfactory in the future, he could just call her to replace her. These words made Easton, Sheridan, and others look at each other in confusion, not knowing what she meant.</p>
<p>After Irene Laurance left, Sheridan said to Easton, "I think this woman has something in her belly." Easton glanced at Sheridan and said, "She has a lot of nerve in her belly." But Sheridan remembered her criticism of Rita Vernon being unworthy to perform "Golden Branch," and felt infinite sympathy for her in his heart, and admired that her eye was not bad.</p>
<p>In the months that followed, Irene always remembered the scene when she first met Louis Easton. The days were getting harder and harder, but no one could take away the hope that Irene had from this meeting. She secretly dreamed, thinking that one day, this dream would come true, but for now, she tightened her belt, vowing to be at odds with hunger, and went out every day to seek her path to victory. She also missed Sheridan in her heart, because Sheridan had given her some opportunities. It was a small role, and she felt that she had messed it up, so she didn't want to see him anymore. She sometimes trembled at the inevitability of failure, and was driven by hunger, the hunger for life, the hunger for career, especially the hunger for food. So she had no choice but to accept small things. But the smaller the thing, the harder it was to see her strengths. She often asked herself, would she become famous or not, but she had to become famous immediately.</p>
<p>Winter came again, Irene Laurance's second winter in New York. A dreary cold rain was falling. That evening, Irene slipped out of her apartment to find something to eat. Her purse told her she could only afford a cup of coffee. She ordered a cup of coffee in that dilapidated coffee shop. The warmth of the coffee in her stomach made her feel much more comfortable. She had to pretend that this was a coffee after a full meal. Suddenly, a very familiar voice called her. (To be continued)</p>
