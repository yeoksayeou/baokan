<h3 id="c21">如何救濟當前之絲業危機 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>最近海外生絲市塲。以囤户競出。走銷呆滯。絲價暴落不已紐約現絲每磅已跌進美金一元六角大關。歐洲市場。亦跌風陡起。大有朝不保夕之勢在此悲觀重重風鶴唳之絲市中。其受最大之打擊者。厥唯我國之絲業。</p>
<p>據報載。自海外絲市暴跌以後。江浙廠絲Ｂ字等級每担已由九百二十元跌至七百元左右。即Ａ級廠絲最近價格。扯合華幣每包值價。亦不過八百七十餘元耳。上海一隅之絲廠。以繅成之絲。虧本至巨。紛紛停工。本年七月間以絲市起色而一度開工之絲廠六十四家。截止前數日止。又不得不重陷於前途暗淡之運命中。計先後停工者達三百分之二。其勉能掙扎者。僅二十家而已。而此勉能開工之二十家。已决議除取消升工禮拜賞蠶蛾等外。並將女工工資每日自五角减爲四角二分。即减工資百分之十六。此雖爲上海一市之現象。然實亦即全國絲業之縮影也。</p>
<p>顧蠶絲業原爲我國之國粹。自西歷一五一六年後。即已行銷海外。華絲到處受人歡迎。視爲珍品。一八六七年後。廣東陳啓元氏始創新式絲廠。改舊有之手工絲業爲機械工業中國絲業。中國絲業。至此始顯有改良之象。然自二十世紀初年以後。日本突起競爭。以科學之方法鍊製。以新式之機械作業。產量旣增。絲質又佳。鄭美各國。爭相購置。而我國絲業界在此時期。則不獨無積極進取之心。且是墨守成法。固步自封。商人之知識又低。對於輸出絲質。向不注意。是時政府。亦無嚴密商品檢騐之制度。因循坐誤。遂致海外市場。拱手讓人而莫可挽救也。</p>
<p>一九二九年後。世界恐慌　發。各國購買力减退。華絲玺路更形縮减故其間雖銀價下落。然仍無補於輸出。前年日本金再禁後。藉貨幣價格之下籌。及其政府雄厚之津貼。故日絲輸出。雖正在此恐慌深淵中。尚能勉强支持。然華絲至此則更膛乎其後矣。吾人據最近二三年來之統計而觀。華絲輸出。已較前減三分之一以上。最近海外絲價暴落。今後輸出。當更困難。不待言也。</p>
<p>此華絲輸出之減退。固爲我國絲業前途之一危機。而年來國内絲織市塲之日益狹隘。又爲其第二危機。蓋年來天災人禍。接踵而至。一般大衆之消費力量。已衰沉殆盡。而海外廉價之人造絲及傾銷之棉毛織品。復潮湧而進。一部份中上級階。或以其光彩眩目。或以其質地經久。樂於爭購。我國固有之絲綢。反致無人問津。雖通街減沽之招貼滿目。而綢店大都門可羅雀。即偶而有一二買主。所購亦大都爲光亮而滲雜人造絲之織品。舊式杭綢湖縐。則購者寥寥。綢業不振之結果。絲業亦直接蒙其不利。</p>
<p>故今日而欲言救濟絲業。當自雙方面着手。一方面設法擴張海外之市塲。另一方面努力推廣國内之市塲。然此二種方策。决非一朝一夕或紙上談兵所能解决。在前者必須明瞭過去華絲輸出減退結之所在。然後痛改前非。迎頭趕去。同時必須藉政府堅强之後盾。努力推銷。吾人雖不能謂因此而佔世界絲市之第一位。然最少可以與東西勁敵相抗衡。在後者吾人實未有具　體之意見。至於如何恢復中國一般大衆之購買力。爲含有政治性之經濟問題。而非三言兩語可以解决之單純問題。所謂不買外貨。奬勵國產。固亦未始非急救治標之法也。</p>
<p>日來統制經濟之聲。甚囂塵上。此絲業之日形衰頽。實即爲當前之急需統制者。若不幸而一旦整個絲業崩潰。直接之結果。當爲數千百萬失業者之產生。而間接全部中國農民之蠶繭副業。亦將宣告崩潰。而成一莫大之社會問題。</p>

<p>本市公共租界電力公司、發生意工風潮、今已二十餘日、雖經各方調解、迄無效果、惟此事公司不早日解决、則工潮擴大、社會無不受有影響、市總工會爲此事、特於昨日發表宣言、作爲最後呼籲、並函請工部局董事會、主持公道、迅謀解决、且於下午三時、招待各報社記者、兹將各情分誌於後、</p>
<p>發表宣言　自公共租界電力公司工潮發生以來、本會深知公用電氣事業、關係社會之重要　、一方面勸導工友、維持電流　務使社會用户利益、不受影響、一方面將經過祥情、公告各界以求公理之裁判、本月九日、發表之報告書、尢爲詳盡、本會重視公益之苦心孤詣、當爲各界所共諒、兹者、公司堅持成見、不作絲毫讓步之表示、近目僱用大批白俄、以代華工、使被迫罷工之工人更形憤激、其無和解誠意、實至明顯、吾人於公司此種舉動、殊深遺憾、本會審察大勢、深恐長此堅持、工友爲生活需要所逼迫、而本會之勸告、失其權威時、激變之來、自在意中、則影響所及、工商各界均蒙其害、是以本會不厭煩凟、再爲我各界人士告、此次工潮起因、在表面觀之、似爲開除工友三人、實則癥結所在、尚遠在歷年公司之連續開除工人、及所給工人應得之養老金、其初工人尚冀公司之覺悟、僅出以隱忍及請求、及至隱忍請求俱不足動公司之心、以致羣情憤激、而成今日嚴重局勢、夫電氣事業、旣關係公衆福利、與社會安寗、吾人似未可任其自然、至有更不幸事件之發生、總之、本會對於處置此次糾紛、已感力竭聲嘶、尚祈各界人士、爲用户利益計、爲華工痛苦計、本監督公用事業之立塲、作嚴正有力之表示、使固執成見之公司當局、知所自悟、社會幸甚、工人幸甚、謹此宣言、</p>
<p>函工部局　上海公共租界工部局董事會公鑒、逕啟者、竊自上海電力公司發生工潮以來、敝會深恐因此引起有礙公衆利益不幸之事變、爲力求避免事態擴大計、曾盡其全力、爲尋覓調解途徑之指導或奔走、雖經黨政機關代表上海市商會主席王曉籟·及華董袁履登·徐新六·諸先生、向該公司表示意見、俱爲該公司當局成見在抱堅决態度所拒絶、卽貴局總裁鍾思先生、在工人請願以後、出任調解之善意、亦未得該公司當局之注意、各工友於無可奈何之中、始爲怠工之警告、嗣因該公司拒絶工作、而激成罷工之事實、然對於工人發電工作、幸能遵敝會之勸告、仍予維持、尚未損及公益、但此種勸告、其效力能否持久、敝會自度無法預計、因是又有邀請社會領袖、共爲維護安寗之集議、發表解决糾紛之報告書、意欲在勸告效力未盡之前、卽得合理之解决、乃待至今日、該公司除發表一意圖侮辱不合事實之公開函件外、未有誠意之表示、其爲有意損毁敝會勸告之效力、而從事爲不幸事變之製造、已無疑義、是貴會就管理市政維護安寗之責任言、不能不加以注意、因此檢奉敝會公告各界報告書及工友駁復公開函件函稿各一份、請貴會詳加察閱、而定是非之誰屬、夫敝會旣已盡力勸工友爲要求條件之讓步、而復以讓</p>
<p>步條件是否會理之判斷、期之於前曾熱心調解之諸先生、自信尊重公道、愛護社會公益之心、已盡於此、倘此種公正合理之表示、又不能使該公司之覺悟、則該公司之目無公道、目無市政、目無助其爲利全體用户之公益、亦顯然可見、是則該公司今日之當局、就其心理見解爲推察、實爲不合經營獨佔公用事業之人才、此貴會爲管理市政及維護安寗公益計、應立予糾正或勸告其董事會與美國總公司、卽予撤換也、否則、其過去藐視鍾思先生之心理、必將進而藐視貴會矣、不獨貴會對於此後計劃全市電力與公益之政策受其阻礙、恐在其祇知圖利壓迫見解之下、激成不幸之事變、亦爲勢所可能、不幸此種事變果成事實、則就市政成續之觀點言必爲紀錄之羞、敝會自知業於罷工工人勸告之努力、决不足以抵抗其生活需要之逼迫、則敝會勸告力盡之時、卽爲事變發生之日、兹乘力猶未盡、特向貴會進言、願貴會用其可有之權、以恊助敝會力防事變、尊重公道及愛護社會公益主張之成功、書不盡言、敬待賜復、</p>
<p>招待記者　總工會於昨日下午三時、招待各報社記者、由朱學範報告工潮經過、略謂、公共租界電力公司、自發生怠工以來、迄已二十餘日、工人方面、以電氣事業關係社會治安至大、故發電部分、仍有工人繼續工作、而公司方面、雖經各方調解、始終無接受誠意、工人現雖受種種痛苦但嚴守秩序、團結一致、其維持治安之苦心、深可爲社會人士所表同情、今日華董虞洽·袁履登·徐新六·曁杜月笙·諸先生、願任調解之責、與工部局磋商解决辦法、工人方面、毫無成見、更無所謂條件、惟求公道之主持、可以立卽復工、但此事而不迅謀解决、使工人迫於無法維持、則一旦發電部分亦宣告停工、則社會上必有感受不安、而工廠所蒙影響、當更嚴重、且本市自一二八案發生以來、各華商工廠、均陷於不景氣、設發電部分一旦停工、工廠更受打擊當不堪設想、故工人初不願出此萬不得已之行動、惟公司方面、再不覺悟、仍存外人事業、其任何措施華人不得稍加反對之心理、以致造成不幸事件之發生、則一切責任、均應由公司負</p>

<p>▲香港首局勝利</p>
<p>開始之時、香港一路導先、首以十一比六勝平、互易陣地之後、平隊努力反攻但終無能爲力、結果港隊以二十一比十六勝首局平隊反攻</p>
<p>▲平隊反攻佔勢</p>
<p>第二局時平隊反攻、步步順利、陳婉若陳愛鳳各有建樹平隊乃得十一比九佔上風、互易場地之後、由姚裏立發球、連殺十分之多、平隊乃得攫取第二局、與港隊成一比一之平均形勢、</p>
<p>▲最後成敗之爭</p>
<p>平港旣各勝一局、第三局確成雙方之生命線、競爭激烈、早在意料之中、果然平隊先獲二十分而港隊則以十九分繼之、旋港再勝一分、遂成二十比二十之和局、復成二十一比二十一、二十二比二十二、與二十三比二十三之形勢、但平隊終以二十五導先而倖勝此局結果港挫於平、最後一局港隊努力反攻、侠隊聲勢益加、如斯平先以十一比七而移場、其後仍由平導先港隊努力追隨、但終以十七比二十一之比數而敗北、總數三比一平勝、</p>
<p>▲勝藝各有千秋</p>
<p>論雙方之技藝　似各有不同、港隊擅長殺扣及開球、平隊穩健善防禦、斯役之勝負、平隊乃以柔制剛、香港之技藝高起一籌、但以球運不濟、</p>

<p>投手技術滬投手爲跳高健將鄒善德、投擲功夫殊佳、上場卽連出三打數兩次、使粤無機可展、第三局又各出三打數一次、不料於第六局上、因臂力衰退、出球輕弱、連被對方放出安打、至以一分慘敗、殊爲可惜、至於粤投手前四局鍾淑清、後二局爲阮柔、技均平平、滬接手湯月英無粤曾淑意穩健、兩隊陣容佈局方面、滬似較勝、打擊方面、不及粤隊、外場員滬除曾惠瓊稍佳外、餘均毫無把握、第六局滬之大失分、一半由於左外場徐文英之失策、又滬三壘上亦多失誤、實爲致敗之因、</p>
<p>▲先發制人</p>
<p>滬先攻、開始孫琤上塲得壘、李寳惠繼之、陸璞珍孟健　打出遠球、孫李生還、粤失誤頻頻、窘於底球、孟曾湯乘對方之失漏、陸續歸壘、連得五分之多、粤上塲鄒善德兩出三打數、連殺二人、毛少芳高球下場、一籌莫展、粤得兩分、滬徐文英上塲偷渡至在壘、向紹芬送徐歸陣、得一分、遭此挫折、吃緊防範、粤三壘梁適宜接陸璞　之高球、再送首壘、演一雙合殺、換場後、粤伍佩琦下後、黄漢賢梁適宜連出安打、陳續歸陣得二分、是局一比二、總計滬六粤二、</p>
<p>▲極端優勢</p>
<p>滬孟健　高球被殺後、曾惠瓊打出遠球、左場失誤、安然登站、潘月英送徐歸陣、任淑鄒善德各放安打、當任亦得二分粤李　玉得安打、但無功下場、滬乃以九比二佔極端優勢、錦標有如囊中物、粤於大敗之下、力圖振作、聲勢漸有起色、第四局始　三人連下、未能佔壘、粤毛少芳上塲、高球被接而死、伍佩琦打出、遠球向右射出、曾惠臻失手、球乃遠逸外場、伍安然生還、黄漢賢安打、梁適宜高球下場、曾淑意亦出本壘打、又加二分、然滬仍以九比五勝、</p>
<p>▲功虧一簣</p>
<p>第五局滬曾潘任三人均以空球下場、而粤接球之老練不可多得、粤亦連下三人、各無進展、第六局上滬徐父英安打、孫淨送徐歸陣、僅得一分、粤毛炳芳上場、三打數被殺、但往後陣容忽亂、鄒善德臂力遜色、粤聲勢大振、連得四分　陳加愛高球下後林　潔已空打二記、以爲有下場希望、不料滬方一失再失、又負二分、斯時粤已以十一比十勝、馬杏燕登壘後、鍾淑清送其歸陣、但鍾打球脚踏出線外、裁判員判其犯規下場、粤堅執不允、乃起爭執、停賽約一刻鐘、經司壘裁判吴邦偉力解釋、決判粤下場、馬之一分不算、第七局滬反攻無效、功虧一簣、粤遂奪得錦標、司球裁判侯洛恂、</p>

<p>▲結果三對一勝</p>
<p>林寳華：：：技藝超羣生平傑作</p>
<p>許承基：：：智盡力竭事與願違</p>
<p>（南京十八日電）十八男女網球均無比賽、網球場上人跡稀少、而一幕精彩表演、卽於此沉寂之空氣中、開始舉行、故開戰之初、觀者寥寥、僅百飶碊人而已、待兩盤結束、方風聲四佈、觀衆紛至沓來、卽時人山人海、坐無隙地、不亞於十七晨許邱之戰、而探得林已連勝兩盤均不勝驚訝、甚有不信者、</p>

<h3 id="c222">誰願爲國貨之敵？ <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 仰𦰃</p>
<p>目下一般摩登女子，時髦學生，於衣食住行上，悉惟洋貨是尚，說者謂循是以往，此輩女子，不啻國貨之敵，痛哉斯言，中國女子同是中華民國之國民同受相當之敎育，人之愛國，誰不如我，人人旣知國之當愛，人入應知服用國貨，信仰國貨。誰願爲國貨之敵？蓋國貨之所以不爲國人一致樂用者，推其原因，應自兩方面共負其責：　　第一在消費者方面</p>
<p>（一）打破虚榮心　一般生長於上海之士女，耳目所濡染，交際所薰陶，均煊耀於舶來品之新奇，認爲服用上最雍容華貴者，無過於舶來之品，大有非此不足以誇示親戚隣里者。此則完全中於虚榮之毒念。其實最光榮最尊貴者，無過於服用國產之品，英國皇后御蘭開夏棉布，而全國靡然從風，人人以服用國布爲榮，即其一證。苟人人能轉移此種觀念，此後認服用洋貨爲可恥，而以服用國產爲可尊，則國貨推行，捷於影響。</p>
<p>（二）應有犧牲心　國貨於今日，尚在幼稚時代，無容諱言。凡服用國貨者，苟覺國貨品質有未盡善處，不妨徐圖改進，國貨價格有昻貴處，不妨暫時犧牲。須知今日國貨品質，與五年前比較，已自不同，與十年前較，更覺大異。果能人人抱犧牲之决心，爲合力之扶助，前途進步，寗有限量</p>
<p>（三）應有指導心　國貨曷爲而須提倡，即以國貨之尚須改進，故我人服用國貨時，覺有不滿之處，不應存厭惡心，應存指導心。某處應仿辦，某處應改良，某點應興，某點應革，則日新月異，出品自有精益求精之望。日本一國，某業中必由公會規定一筆改進費，專供奬勵同業改良出品或試騐之用。我國人苟人人抱此志願，凡至一國貨公司，或一工廠，採辦用品，倘感覺到有應行改進之處，不妨當場提出，多方指導，吾知國貨廠商同爲國貨上奮鬥，自必樂予採納也。</p>
<p>第二在生產者方面</p>
<p>（一）革除乘機發財　國貨之廠，不僅在摩登女子，時髦學生，而在乘機發財之</p>
<p>國貨商。往往有一般不知愛國之商人，趁此盛唱國貨時代，抬高貨價，惟利是圖，以灰熱心服用國貨者之心，此則不啻摧殘國貨，我國貨界千萬不可有此心理。</p>
<p>（二）不可粗製濫造　國貨之取得一般人信用，全在出品之精良耐用，如果心存僥倖，粗製濫造，以博一時之利，而以欺人朦蔽爲得計，此自殺政策，亟宜革除。</p>
<p>（三）不可改頭換面　社會上可以發財之機會正多，何苦汨没良心，營此不可告人之伎倆。明明爲日貨，而更換商標，詭稱國產。明明爲舶來品。而私行改裝，妄謂自製。以致即愛用國貨者，魚目混珠，亦發生懷疑，而失却愛用國貨之信仰心。是適足以造成外貨傾銷之機會，此則不啻國貨之敵，其罪何可勝誅。</p>
<p>誰願爲國貨之敵？此則希望產銷兩方，一致努力，爲國貨前途癖定新生命耳。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c223">請敎師們負着提倡國貨的責任 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>我們從越王勾踐所說的「址年敎訓」這句話兒。移贈給全國的敎師們。我覺得最痛心一件事。就是許多的青年男女。做了推銷舶來品的忠實同志。我的朋</p>
<p>友。他是擔任了某地的學。他常常同我說。近年來的中學生和大學生。都是很熱心國事的。但是反轉來說。也都是以外貨爲其日用所需的。幾乎有一日不可缺少外貨。來裝飾他的身體。尤其是一斑高聲疾呼的女性們。從頭至足。都屈伏在外貨勢力之下。所以有許多抱冷靜態度的人。常常笑青年的男女們　未免有矛盾的玩意兒吧。但是說話又說轉</p>
<p>來。這不是青年男女的罪。是指導青年。負敎者責任的敎師。不能辭其咎。因爲青年受了社會渲染同化。所以趨入嗜用外貨的地步。做敎師不是祇負敎書的責任。旁的就可以不管了。當然除了敎書以外。對於青年一切病態弱點。都應該糾正指導。無論在課堂中。或者課後的時候。多向學生用懇切的言語。誠摯的態度。使得重視外貨的學生。頓然改變了他的個性。做了一個受用國貨的青年。這的効力。我覺得比任還來得大些。影響所及。也來得迅速。尤其是女校中的女敎師。以身作則。服用國貨。用忠言勸導喜用外貨的學生。使得她已冷的死灰。頓然熱了起來。外貨失掉了人民購買。就算不去抵制。也自會消滅。否則不買某貨。改用某貨。以暴易暴。有何用呢。親愛的全國敎師們。你們做一番宣傳工作吧。若然合了越王的十年敎訓。這樣下去。十年以後。外貨的能絶跡。我可以罰一個誓。「隨便誰人。殺了我以謝國人」。</p>
<h3 id="c224">「秋季大廉價」與國貨 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 玄禺</p>
<p>秋風的影　，各條馬路上「秋季大廉價」的旗幟，已在開始飄揚，一切眩</p>
<p>目的廣告，也更已施展着他的威力，觸入我們的眼簾，好像告訴我們「秋」到了，因爲氣候的變更，人們的生活上將有一度發生嚴重變化的來臨，而倘使你們要及早凖備—　—添置物件的話，那末，各大商場，店舖，都已在等候着你，</p>
<p>自然，減價是吸引顧客購買唯一的工具，同時，也就是關係自身獲到社會信譽最良好的時機，在這個時候，我們國貨工廠的銷售機關｜國貨公司，國貨商場，及各處自設之門市部，爲着應時隨俗，也不得不要跟着他們，來舉行一次盛大的减價，可是，在這裏，我們就得須有一個深切的觀點，我們要曉得現下一般普通商店的所謂「减價」，連綿不絶，家常便飯，這種徒擁虚名，毫無實際的舉動，在他們是不過利用這個名義上的號召力，來吸收一般的購買力和乘時活動而已，其觀點之低淺，性質之片而而不能持久，果亦不言可喻，那麽假使拿這種政策來使我們｜國貨機關的立場上去偏效他，自然是大謬，然，因爲我們的减價，却至少要含有下列兩重的意義：</p>
<p>一、乘時取信於社會　這個我們現在可就單以滬埠一處來講，國貨的銷售機關，果以不少，但是販賣洋貨的，却也並未絶跡，所以當這個同時舉行减價的時候，我們正應如何忠實的犧牲，務求貨眞價廉。實事求是，有一種驚人的表現</p>
<p>，以使社會上各界人士的倍加信用。</p>
<p>二、乘時介紹新出品　這是就將各廠最近的新出品，趁這機會，來介紹給社會大衆知曉而採用，就像此次中國國貨公司的减價裏，儘量介紹美亞的糺縵縐，及胡蝶呢等，大櫉窗裏，很顯耀的陳列着，他的銷售水凖，到底也就由小而大，漸次推擴，</p>
<p>總之，我們須以「宣揚」「推廣」爲前提，要以有意義有價值的計劃來舉行减價，眼光放得遠，現在的犧牲，就是將來的收效，他們雙方是絶對成正比例的，試思假定國人個個愛用國貨，外貨絶跡，到那時候，還怕國貨没有銷路嗎！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c225">推銷國貨幾個重要問題的討論 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 自强</p>
<p>國貨—國貨—呌破了耳膜—眩壞了眼簾—這是國貨年的新貢獻—這是有史以來破題　弟一遭—</p>
<p>我們祇消留心一下報紙，就可以看到關於國貨的消息，以及推銷國貨各公司各商號的大减價，—尤其是國貨展覽會，應時開幕，值得我們紀念啊！兹謹買其一得之愚，來商討幾個間題，該不致閉門不納罷！</p>
<p>一、推銷國貨應擴充範圍：—每逢各大公司各大商號大減價的時候，犧牲的貨品，每每只限本埠；這樣一來，本埠的人，可以近水樓臺先得月，外埠的人，祗好埀涎三尺，欲購不能，所以擴充範圍是第一個重要問題。</p>
<p>二、外埠交易應寬限時日：—外埠</p>
<p>距本埠太遠，或舟車不通的地方，而失却良機，雖然以郵戳爲憑，還不是澈底</p>
<p>的好辦法，要使本埠外埠利益均沾，除非寬限時日，便宜姗姗來遲之外埠不可　　三、郵寄貨品應顧全信用：—外埠購貨惟一恃郵政以爲傳遞的機關。但是當面買貨，尚且以假亂眞，郵購自更不堪設想，爲實事求是，顧全信用起見，應該貨眞價實，遠近無欺才好。</p>
<p>其批發另售應劃一價目：—中國商界，向不講究商業道德，賣空買空，恃爲惟一之能事，而價目亦至不劃一，除非門檻中人，才買得着便宜貨。鄕下的土老兒，可就吃虧了，所以劃一價目，也是值得討論的。</p>
<p>以上所述，均係推銷國貨最重要的問題，小言之，關係國貨的前途，大言之，關係國家之命脈，現在雖是農村破</p>
<p>產，已經到山窮水盡的時候，可是社會上畸形的現象，仍舊很多：（一）無購買力，（二）有購買力而没有處買，這樣的結果，是國民和國貨很少發生關係，這並不是内地的人民和國貨無緣，不過是不得其門而入罷了。</p>

<p>今天民衆茶園裏的裝置已全部換了式樣，四面靠着牆壁的桌子上擺滿了棉布棉紗繭子穀類等土產物，都用玻璃盒子裝着：人也多了一倍，大家陸續的在看那些土貨。後來一個身空青布短衫的中年男子走上講台，表明是一個很熱烈於土貨運動中的一份子，底下就有好多人開口說：「這就是邰爽秋博士？」「邰博士竟這樣的熱心土貨運動嗎？」於是我有腦中也無形的把邰博士三個字留了下來，他開口說：</p>
<p>「諸位同胞，我知道你們是覺悟者，每一個人都已認清了土貨運動的價值，但是看到了你們身上的衣服，手裏的捲烟，：：：就不禁要向你們流淚！唉，因爲你們愛用外國貨，所以就有四萬萬兩的金元納入外國人的腰包裏，平均起來，我們全中國每一個人每一年要恭送一元多給外國人，爲什麽呢？你們要學漂亮啊？唉，爲着你們要漂高，所以每年要把四萬萬兩送人，這是多麽痛心的事！同胞們，我在以前也曾穿過西裝，也曾學過漂亮，但是我在五年前，早就深深的覺悟到中國不久就要亡在外人的經濟侵略手裏，不得不起來喚醒我們醉生夢生的同胞—你看，我身上的青布短衫，難道就不可算衣服？定要穿了西裝，外國衣料才算漂亮？才算時髦？唉，諸位同胞，你們還要漂亮嗎？還要時髦嗎？那一個是覺悟者，從速立下一個志向，誓死採用土貨，現在就請他上來和我握手。」我於是隨了他們跑上講台，等邰博士的手觸着了我的手，我頓時覺得他的全部土貨運動的熱血，直向我身上衝擊，好像給我一個很嚴厲的責罰一般，我不禁也隨他們而流淚了。</p>

<p>（三）化妝品以廣義言。包含牙粉，牙膏，香皂，花露水，生髮油，香粉，撲粉，雪花粉等。</p>
<p>近來各廠於物質方面，除香水無特殊成續外。尚稱進步。至潤髮膏等，油膩之劑，則因習尚之轉移。已歸淘汰。</p>
<p>又查我國化妝品業之重心。可稱集中於上海。香港之廣生行。先施二廠。在滬亦已設廠。天津北平次之。營業方面。平津各廠。以地理關係。其出品銷售華北居多。港粤各廠。出品大半行銷華南而南洋各埠。交易亦廣。至上海各廠出品。則普及全國及僑民所至之地。自</p>
<p>九一八後。與日人競爭多年之東三省市塲。竟無插足餘地。此則領土損失以外之經濟損失矣</p>
<p>。國人所不遑計及者也。至香亞公司。因經營未能順利。疊經改組。差幸尚能維持。不料一二八之役。閘北香亞工廠。化爲灰燼。能否復興。殊無把握。此點化妝品之厄運也。總之自東北事件發生後。交易頗呈停滯之象。去年五月滬戰停協定簽字後。曾一度稍見活動。但轉瞬又無起色。其原因固由社會經濟之不景氣。而南洋銷路之呆滯。（詳見後載）亦係一重大打擊也。</p>
<p>化妝品廠。亦有利用其設備。及工料之便利。以兼營副業者。如中國化學工業社有蚊虫香，調味品，殺虫粉，菓子露等。家庭工業社有蚊香，酒類，橘子汁。永和實業公司有油墨，減蚊香，橡膠品，殺虫藥水。此皆化學工業發展之好現象也。</p>
<p>化妝品注重裝璜，所用之標貼紙盒，鐵罐盒，向都内製造。而上等玻瓶。則常取材於異邦。今則幾全數委國内料器廠承辦。其出品與洋貨殊無二致。統計每年可挽回利權不少。工業勃興。往往發生連帶效用。實業家。宜知所借鑒。以裕民生矣。</p>

<p>大阿福和洋囝囝</p>
<p>團團的粉臉，塗着兩點臙脂；方方的額角，梳着幾條流海：笑口常開，好像彌勒佛一般。這是惠山出產的泥人，那個不知那個不曉的大阿福。</p>
<p>大阿福到了小玲姑娘的家裏，小玲姑娘愛牠萬分。張着小口，唱歌給牠聽；拍着小手，跳舞給牠看；不論有了甚麽糕餅果餌，先要給牠吃；晚上還要和牠一頭睡眠。大阿福也愛着小玲姑娘，對着她不聲不響，只是嘻嘻地笑。</p>
<p>一月後的大阿福，命宮裏遭着磨蝎。小玲姑娘替牠洗臉，脂粉盡去，變成了泥士斑駁的面孔。小玲姑娘一失手，又把牠跌得粉身碎骨。小玲姑娘嚷着，哭着，她媽便找了一位西洋來的洋囡囡，做牠的伴侶。</p>
<p>洋囡囡眞美麗，金黄的頭髮；蘋果的面孔；玲瓏的身軀；時髦的衣服，引得小玲愛上加愛。牠唱歌，跳舞，喂果餌，同睡眠，反以前愛大阿福的心，一齊獻給在洋囡囡的面前。「只見新人笑，那聞舊人哭。」洋囝囝洋洋得意，大阿福壁角垂淚。一天，洋囡囡淋着了雨，渾身濕透。小玲替牠烤火，衣服乾了，身體燥了，小玲還替牠烤。嗤的一聲，洋囝囝變做火孩兒，樹脂松香的氣味充滿了一室。小玲姑娘號啕大哭，原來兩隻小手已炙成了紅腫水泡。</p>
<p>洋囡囡害了小玲姑娘，害得她吃飯哭；睡覺哭。她恨牠不該燒壞了她兩隻小手足，足病倒了一月之久。</p>
<p>小玲病好了，大阿福又來了，她說道；「我愛你，希望人人都愛你，你是一團和氣，不會暗箭傷人的。害人的洋囝囝，我一世不願見牠的面」。</p>
<p>大餅油條</p>
<p>早上起來，田岸上路一周。天空是清潔的，大地是沉靜的，一股早氣，撲到鼻管裏，像甘露一般的凉澈臟腑。</p>
<p>肚子微微的餓了，剛出爐的大餅，剛離鑊的的油條，害得人垂涎。化了九個銅子，兩餅夾一條，嚼着，嚥着，香脆鹹甜，兼而有之，連呼快哉！快哉！</p>
<p>在上海我也每天嚼着麵包，也嚼着花旗粉做的奶油麵包。甜不甜，鹹不鹹，酸不酸，那裏有大餅油條的人味呢？喜甜的加上了果子醬；喜鹹的　上了白栩汕，或是夾了火腿片，味道總算好一些，可是一頓麵包，已抵上了大魚大内的價錢。</p>
<p>大餅油條，似乎是無產階級的專用品，有錢人不屑去咬嚼。其實滋養料豐富，比之燕窩白木耳，有過無不及。—燕窩白木耳是否滋補？在新醫藥上還屬疑問。—吃慣了燕窩白木耳，當然不肯去嚼大餅油條；咬慣了洋麵包的人，也不肯去嚼大餅油條，於是大餅油條，也實行其平民工作了。</p>
<p>可是我終究喜歡他，還勸人去咬嚼他。這時微風吹來一陣歌聲，不知學生們在唱呢？還是工人們在唱？那歌辭道；</p>
<p>「大餅油條，大餅油條，脆麻花，三個銅子買一方，眞好吃！眞好吃」！</p>

<p>— 李祖範</p>
<p>慨自五四以還，國人怵於外國經濟侵略之嚴竣，國内舊式手工業之　落，有志之士，紛</p>
<p>起共謀積極的提倡國貨，以圖自救：然而十餘年來，不但缺乏顯著之成效，試一檢海關貿易册之人超，且復年有增加焉！此種現象，半固由於我國貨界之組織未能儘全，步驟未能一致，以致主張紛歧，力量薄弱；而政府之未能切實施行保護政策，要尤爲國貨工商業發展之一重大阻碍也。</p>
<p>國民政府奠都南京後，一切施政，均本三民主義之立塲，以提倡生產改進民生爲原則，其昭示吾國民者；一則曰「扶掖農工」，再則曰「實業救國，」旨哉言也，风國貨工商界固無日不陷於呻吟苦痛之環境中，引領以待我政府有以救濟及扶掖之也。然而訓政四年，政治之紊亂也依然如故，民生之凋敝也依然如故，以致外貨之傾銷也，國貨之不振也，均復依然如故。試推究之，則以正府未能予人民以有效之扶助，實爲最大主因，蓋一國工商業之發達與否，恒與政治互爲因果。彼歐美工商業發達諸國，其政府之所以謀社會經濟穩固與發展者，咸列爲政綱之首要，關於扶掖農工商事，尤多載諸憲法，特訂規章，輕其稅而利其推銷，助以資而促其成功，凡能爲工商業謀利益者，無不以全力赴之；由是工商業愈發達，社會經濟愈富裕，而國家政治亦於以安定焉。反觀我國，外侮内亂，日相交迫。苛捐雜稅，民不聊生，我國貨工商界，在此狀况之下，而欲求向外之發展，不亦戞戞乎其難哉！</p>
<p>邇者，我政府鑒於世界經濟競爭，已日趨於尖銳化，深知非提倡國貨，不足以挽救危亡，特明定本年爲國貨年，並以政治的力量，喚起民衆，通力合作，冀在此不景氣狀態中，打開新的出路，觀乎最近各地展覽會之踴躍，吾人誠不勝欣慰，對於提倡國貨，發生更熱烈之期望。</p>
<p>惟是，吾人仍有不得已之苦痛，而必須我政府陳述者，兹請約略言之：（一）進口稅之亟應修正也經濟濟議以打倒關稅壁壘竸相號召，其結果各國之壁壘競相加高，我國政府於本年五月間，曾一度修正稅率；然多數進口貨物之稅率，仍舊未予更動，致甫經萌芽之國貨，日與國外數十年大資本之工廠低稅進口之出品相競爭，其勝負寗待著龜乎！不寗維是；嘗見一工廠其原料進口稅率，往往高出成品之輸入稅率，此與奬勵工業，眞乃背道而馳，此進口稅率之所以不可不亟予整頓者也。</p>
<p>（二）二五附稅之亟宜廢除也　我國現行關稅，除值百抽五之正稅外，尚須另加二五附稅一道，按二五附稅之施行，爲民國十六年始，嘗時施行此稅，原爲充作二五國庫劵之基金。二五國庫劵之發行，十六年初次發行額爲三千萬元，十七年續發四千萬元，其用途指定爲軍需政費預算不足及歸還短期借欵之用，以二十二年四月底爲付還本息之最終時期。今則還本之期業已屆滿，故二五附稅之徵收，在事實上自無再行存在之理由。方今我國工商凋敝，何堪於正稅之外，再納附稅，若云國家軍政各費之虞不足也，則關稅旣已自主，自應加重入口稅，以資挹注。我政府果有體恤商艱解除民國之眞意乎？請自廢除二五附稅始。</p>
<p>（三）一切苛捐之宜切實制止也　自二十一年之元旦，我政府實行宣佈關稅自主後，同時裁撤厘金，及廢除一切苛捐雜稅，其對於機製國貨之免除重徵，固已不惜三令五申；然以我國政治未上軌道，軍閥據地自肥，中央政權不能及於徧僻諸省因是明令等於具文，重徵依然如故，例如由滬至四川甘肅等處，其運輸捐稅等費，恒需超過貨物本身價值二倍以上，如是而欲求國貨之推廣，又烏乎可？我政府欲扶掖工商業之發展，自應迅以有效的方法，切實制止此項重徵，使國貨得以遍銷内地；否則提倡偏於都市，外貨貨銷於僻鄕，振興國貨之望，恐終成畫餅也。</p>
<p>（四）宜積極致力於交通建設也、我國自五院成立，一切行政上之設施，漸見進涉，卽以交通一事而論，除交通部外，更特設鐵道部，以專其責，其所以謀工商運輸之便利者，用心非不深遠，惟以頻年内亂不已，外侮侵尋，國家大部稅收，均耗於軍備，因之交通建設，反形迂緩，卽以號稱建設孟晉之蘇浙皖贛諸省而言，各叚公路次第完成，但其利僅及於行旅，至於貨物運輸，仍鮮克有濟，其他交通閉塞各區域，更無論矣。我政府如欲謀解除工商業之困苦者，應速積極整頓交通，以利民輸，良以交通之與苛稅，恒成一正比例，交通倘能便利，則内地苛稅，失其憑藉，亦自易廢除矣。</p>
<p>以上三端，僅舉吾人切身利害之犖犖大者，餘如工業原料之開發也，技術人員之養成也，亦均有賴我政府之切實籌劃，冀謀根本之解决。今者訓政行將完成，憲政卽須開始，關於扶掖農工商之綱要，已見諸憲法草案中，吾人固切望其早日通過。而能見諸實行也。</p>
<h3 id="c230">怎樣去提倡國貨 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 星墅</p>
<p>在生產落後的中國，我國工業品的生產額和惟費額，形成了二與五之比的現象，而同時，物質上的增進，却又一日千里，國人們對於工業品的需要，於此可以想見。</p>
<p>因此，我們當這提倡國貨的年頭，我們要解决提倡國貨的根本辦法，最好是由全國各大工廠聯合營業不可，因爲聯合營業的好處，在：</p>
<p>（一）限制生產額，</p>
<p>（二）估定標準價，</p>
<p>（三）得集中人才，分頭推銷。</p>
<p>（四）得實施通盤計劃，</p>
<p>（五）得免無謂競爭，致兩敗俱傷，</p>
<p>（六）可以具體的謀產銷合作。</p>
<p>總之，我國要聯合整個的工業界的力量，以求產銷額之平衡，中國化學工</p>
<p>業社的方液仙先生，便是本此主旨，在那裏積極進行這個工作，如中國國貨公司的發起，便是根據這個理想而實現，預料在最近的將來，在整個的國貨界，當有一番新的發展了。</p>
<h3 id="c231">農工合作問題 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 火星</p>
<p>在現代生產落後的中國社會，我以爲亟待解决的問題｜是農工合作，因爲事實上已告訴我們，工業品的原料，大部份要仰給於農村，而偏徧我們近年來的農村經濟，却又天天在閙着恐慌，因此，工業界也不能有改好的發展了，所以從今以後，我們要國產品產量額的增加，非脚踏實地去和農民合作不可。現在吾且舉兩個例子於下：</p>
<p>譬如製造殺蟲的原料是除蟲菊，但是除蟲菊在目前國内的農業上，還没有普遍種植，眼見每年國内需要的殺蟲原料，因供不應求，而不得不仰給於國外的除蟲菊，假使我們農村中都有相當的栽培，那麽每年的收獲，足敷自己應用，農工問題，便同時得了相當解决。</p>
<p>再如製造調味品的原料，是爲頭麥所煉製，而荳麥的出產，又需農民的努力，以供給我們國貨工廠的需求。</p>
<p>中國貨學工業社，一方面在製造新的工業品，一方面也在積極提倡農產，如提倡種植除蟲菊，及與農民直接訂立合作條約等，便是一個很好的實例。希望我國整個的農業界起來和我們通力合作，以完成那最大的願望。</p>
<h3 id="c232">三星焦糖醬色在工業上的貢獻 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 新生</p>
<p>自從科學昌明以後，各國工業上都有了突飛孟晋的趨勢，關於生活上的各種日常用品，尤其是日新月異，那些不合科學原理的舊工業，幾幾乎都無形的淘汰了！我國地大物博，出廠衆多，可惜國人只知墨守成法，不思改進，’所以成了生產落後的國家，而感受外人經濟侵略的痛苦！一般有　之士，早已有　及此，一致　爲非「改良工業，增加生產。」不足以救危亡！中國化學工業社，創立於民元，以改良工業爲宗旨，專用化學的方法，製造各項新工業用品，對於已出各品，頗爲社會所讚許；最近，該社因鑒於舊式炒糖的不衛生，不經濟，不簡便！所以應用化學的方法研究，製造了「三星牌新式焦糖醬色」，現在經全國諸大醬園，　坊等試用的結果，一致認爲滿意。</p>
<p>三星牌焦糖醬色，是依化學的方法，用機器製造的，它的原料是用小麥粉製成葡萄糖，再從葡萄糖製成焦糖醬色一，蒸至極濃，質料純粹，顏色深濃魚明，它的效用，和舊工炒糖比較，至少有下列幾種優點：</p>
<p>（一）同一效用，可滅省費用一半，製造家得以减輕出品的成本，</p>
<p>（二）品質純潔，無渣滓溷濁等弊。</p>
<p>（三）無臭無味，不發酵，不發霉。</p>
<p>（四）祇須加沸水溶化，便可應用，極爲簡便。</p>
<p>（五）顏色深淺有標準，按量使用，無太過和不及之弊！</p>
<p>（六）品質精良，此日貨有過無不及，而且價格較廉，足以抵制外貨。</p>
<p>總之，這種新式焦糖，在我國工業上是一種新出品，在實用上敢稱得「物美價廉」四字，不過，這種新工業出品，出世未久，行銷還未能普及，希望各地製造業多多採用比較，一致提倡，爲製造上節省消耗，爲食料上增進清潔，而於國家的經濟，也可挽塞一部份漏巵。</p>
<h3 id="c233">因皮膚組織研究人工美容法 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 陳懷圃</p>
<p>—從國產化妝品中所得的結果—</p>
<p>皮膚的顏色，是由於皮膚細胞和細胞内的色素顆粒，因了色素分量的不同，就分出此間各色人種：卽使在同一種色的人，也分成凡色素量少的人皮膚呈黄，色素量多的人皮膚呈黑，所以我們不必歆羨白色人種的艷麗，在没有方法改變色素以前</p>
<p>，黄種人祗得黄皮膚到底，黑種人祗得黑皮膚下去，若果我們看到一個不與日光接觸，或是病患者死白的黄種人皮膚，白的程度或許比白種人皮膚還利害，但是不能說白得比白種人艷麗，這就是和孟夫人說的白雪白羽底譬喻同樣滑稽。</p>
<p>若使談到皮膚的美麗，决不會單向白晢或者黧黑上講究，凡是皮膚能柔滑光潤，方算得美麗而健全的。提起我們平常口頭所稱謂的皮膚，意義眞可謂狹窄極了，在生理學書上僅僅是皮膚組織成全體中間的一部分，祇是皮膚最外表的角層，在角層以下的好幾種組織都忽略過去了。就算</p>
<p>我們稱做皮膚的角層倘使要他柔滑光潤，應當明瞭最有關係的皮脂。</p>
<p>皮脂在顯微鏡下的成分，是無數小顆粒，少數充滿脂肪的腺細胞，已經起了變化的細胞膜，和膽汁精（Ｃｈｏｌｅｓｔｅｒａｒｉｎ）底結晶。化學成分是液體脂油和固體軟脂爲主，其他則有脂肪石鹼少量膽汁精，蛋白，越幾斯物，無機鹽類等組成，因爲此種皮脂内含油脂分泌作用，把皮膚（角層）滋潤，毛髮柔滑了：皮脂時常進行新陳代謝的作用，把皮膚表面角層和死壞了的皮膚組織細胞向外傾擠出來，因此我們身體上發現了許多皮屑跌落下來，皮膚上也感覺有油污垢膩的排洩物。</p>
<p>我們注意皮膚美麗的原因，當然不在美容可以求悅於人，况且人體由皮膚所吸</p>
<p>收的養氣，排洩的炭酸氣，在一晝夜間，幾乎同肺量所吸入呼出底相等，自然應當注意了。現在旣明白皮膚組織和皮脂效用的大槪，又有不得不講究注意底理由，但是人類總想望着皮膚白晢艷麗的方法能夠實現，無奈色素無可改造，便不得不想像到人工白色方法，歷舉了許多内服外搽的各種能使皮膚色白的藥劑，竟然極少能夠眞正慰藉渴望着永久美容方法，便不得不再退一步想像到彌補一時的化妝方法，便從國產化妝品製造廠中局部底加以研究，結果便有中國化學工業社出品下列的各種，可以供給社會仕女日常使用，保證安全無書，定有化媸爲妍，同臻佳麗之實效。</p>
<p>一，牡丹香皂　香皂之鑑别方法甚夥，以不含有游離鹼質者爲尚，然而含有未純凈鹼化之脂肪亦非所宜，多含不溶解物體者亦非良品，現在中國化學工業社所出各種悉皂。皆無此種弊病，尤其如新出品牡丹香皂，更爲精良，表面不呈現白點是没有游離鹼質的證據，以切斷面印壓白紙向日光中映視，不見油漬，是没有未凈鹼化脂肪的證據：若使在濃酒精下試騐没有不溶解的沉澱，便是不含不溶解物體的證據。</p>
<p>二，芳澤脂　這又是一種最有裨益於皮膚的出品，是一種純凈脂肪質，我們知道皮膚能吸收一切氣體，但是連續黏附的液體和軟脂體也能吸收，所以此種脂肪能受吸收，到達皮脂以内可以增進其分泌作用，故於冬令皮脂乾涸凍家坼裂之間和那班皮脂缺乏的人，以及用胰皂探洗皮膚，男子修面之後，日常敷搽，最爲適宜。</p>
<p>三，天鵝撲粉　香粉之最易引起皮膚病患者，就是含有鉛分，卽爲少量，用之日久，亦能使皮膚粗糙，生許多粉剌，利害些就在皮膚生出黑褐色斑點，鉛毒遍及全身的時候，竟使身體消瘦，食慾低退，口裡發出惡臭，因爲這種鉛白粉含有氣化鋁，炭酸鋁等本不溶解性的東西，却當一和汗脂化合便變了溶解性，通過皮膚，再浸入血液是很危險！這種天鵝撲粉確由無毒性的炭酸鎂和不剌激的香料，並且富於脂肪，質輕而不閉塞毛孔。</p>
<p>四，時代霜　不獨能使皮膚膨脹軟化，抵抗風日的侵襲，並且能吸出預備在毛孔中排洩出來的污垢，增進細胞的分泌機能，使得新生細胞在良好狀態中生活，已</p>
<p>經萎死了的細胞很順利地在代謝狀態中傾擠出來。</p>
<p>我們有了這四項精美的化妝品，相輔以爲用，可保證絶對不使皮膚受有損害，而達到美容底目的，所以特别提出來貢獻給大衆。</p>
<h3 id="c234">除虫菊栽培法編後語 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 懷圃</p>
<p>比者中國化學工業社編著第四版增訂本除蟲菊裁培法，請俞誠如君主筆，委本人潤文，此種學術文字，原不待藻飾，爲之校勘數四，旣得先覩内容，復能熱知種植方法，已堪竊幸，而感想叢</p>
<p>集，實不獲已於不一傾吐焉。</p>
<p>除蟲菊功能之發現遠在四百三十年前，輾轉傳佈，至今種植者，遍及歐亞北美諸大陸，產量當推美日兩國爲最鉅，歐洲各國次之，然當本人執筆而欲爲本書潤文之際，博徵中外典籍，竟不可得一詳盡有系統之記述，能爲參證，略如本書者，是則本書之爲創著實屬難能，而純粹以十餘年來種植經騐，編次以成，絶不攙入空泛理論，尤爲可貴。</p>
<p>國内以種植除蟲菊而增殖其企業，併採用爲原料者，亦始於中國化學工業社之製造殺蚊盤香，憶自民國六年創闢農塲，而積佔田二百餘畝，規模完善，產量年有增加，猶記本年招待各界有志種植除蟲菊之仕女參觀安浪渡試騐塲，裙屐聯翩，稱盛一時，因歷年提倡之結果，遂使社會各界得有深切之印象。</p>
<p>按除蟲菊以實生株發蘖爲較優，是則供給種子又爲急需，故中國化學工業社每年必有巨量之除蟲菊種子分讓同志，一本眞實提倡之旨，定最低廉之價格，即如本年收穫種子八十餘斤，不旬日而告售罄，而各地訂購函件，猶紛投沓來，祇得另向其他農塲斥重價購入數十磅，不惜犧牲，仍照原定每市兩五角轉讓，較之市上每兩價八角，一元餘甚至三元者，相差遠甚，又以選種精審，至今各地所育成之苗，已具相當成績矣。</p>
<p>近年農村經濟危殆，農民生活艱難，所種植之各種農作物歉收，施肥人工種之投入資本，俱難望收回，而種植除蟲菊獨爲簡易，收益尤優，通常每畝年可純收益三十七元，若能自耕，收益尚可增加，如行輪植，則收益更多，眞爲挽救農村經濟之唯一生路，不獨供給國内化學工業界爲生產消費之用，與挽回若干利權而已！</p>

<h3 id="c235">義與利 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>前天唐蔚芝先生到蘇州國學會演講孟子學，說孟子七章，只是義利之辨。並且慨嘆於近今的朝野，大有「上下交爭利」的局面。說得非常透澈，不是像十三經注疏盤，以經解經，弄得人頭昏腦賬，結果還是莫名其妙。</p>
<p>依我看來，現在的中國，比孟子所見的中國好得多咧。並且目那些王，那些大夫，那些士庶人，也比較的漂亮得多。試瞧報紙上發表的談話，那一位不是在想福國利民的計畫，他們不說利國，利家，而說利民。國字太空虚，民字何等實際。至於與民爭利的話，只在肚皮裏打轉，從來不肯溜出嘴巴來的，這也是二千多年傳統下來的涵養功夫。</p>
<p>約法上雖然把權利義務對等的列舉着，但我們只聽見人家嚷着「利權外溢」了，要「挽回利權」啦。惟恐人之不爭利。再從另一方面看，從前筆記上常有的義僕，義婢，義盜，義丐，甚至非我族類的犬，也有義的。難道都和八股文，辮子一齊淘汰了？或者他們不願意再瞧見這種畸形的私德的發展吧？所以有聞必錄的報紙，對於這些事擯諸簏（字紙簏）内了。</p>
<p>我不是爲武俠小說張目，的確，眼見社會上種種的不平，一肚怪悶氣，只有借他來發洩了。我們展開報紙，除掉年世界舞台上戴了面具的跳加官，和國立舞台上一盤散沙的魔術以外，全是淫欲，盜竊一類的寫眞。尤其是於男女之間的描寫，平肯一字苟且，不肯一句鬆懈，在他們是算利已利人吧？</p>
<p>「佳人已屬沙叱利，義士今無古押衙」只消勾去六個字，可以貼切着現代了。是「佳人屬利，義士今無。」至於佳人的解釋，當然不是狹義的。</p>
<h3 id="c236">女人 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>本來，我們旣然是「人」，天然說人的話，吃人的飯，盡人的義務，享人的權利，一切的一切，實行其所謂「做人」。那麽，人的我們，做人的我們，不是人命令我們做的我們，那裏還容得人給予那些離開了「人」的稱謂：動搖我們的「人」的立塲？然而偏有聰明的，自私的，就爲生理上那一點的不同，便煞費苦心價搬弄出一個「女」字來冠在人的上面，算做區别，形容一種神秘；同時，也眞有没腦子的，居然會接受下來，於是，就給無形地下了一個桎梏，人是永恒在這桎梏中生活着，爭競着了。試看：在從前爭着做的是烈女，貞女，···在現在是轉變而爲交際花，皇后，···也有半覺悟地趕着女權，女運，···眞可憐·伊們—　—其實是他們—　—桎梏中的伊們。自以爲旣然是「女」，天然唯女是務，非女莫問，換句話說：伊們始終只曉得伊們是「女人」，始終不知道伊們是「人」。</p>
<p>這是女人的罪狀嗎？事實是的確展佈在眼前，在國難中：伊們身上的衣裳，面上的脂粉，以及眩人的妝飾，迷人的香料，那一件不是舶來品，高價的舶來品；伊們整天價只是跳舞，看戲，吃大菜，坐汽車，特别是肉感；伊們分去人家的金錢，耗去人家的精力；伊們：：：這樣的奢侈，淫靡，無疑地，正人君子那個不要做他譏嘲的對象，責備的目標，歎息的資料，何况是在國難下，更會不禁地想起國難的發生，國難的救不得，大一半許是伊們的奢侈，淫靡，玉成之。然而，然而，這固然是伊們的罪狀嗎？私有制度的社會，早把伊們當做是私產，當做是商品，抑壓着，威嚇着，誘惑着，使伊們失了反抗本能的服從，同時，又使伊們做高等階級的玩具，難道這也是伊們的罪狀嗎？唉！社會制度擠成伊們做各式各種的奴隸，可憐！被擠做了奴隸，還把罪名加到伊們頭上，更可憐！</p>
<h3 id="c237">重樓隨筆 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>易卜生說「世界上最有理性的人，便是最孤立的一個人」。從這句話中，我們便可以知道力量對於個人關係之重要！一個運動員能保持着别人打不破的紀錄，一個大文豪能得到全世界讀者的推崇，這不是力量至上的明證嗎？</p>
<p>如果因爲「一個弱者拿一枝手槍，就可以把一個强者打死。一個精神頽廢者吸兩口鴉片，就忽然會精神百倍」。而對力量起了懷疑！那就、須得請他注意那個弱者也和强者一樣都没有手槍，那吸食鴉片不是自促其生命中的話。</p>
<p>朋友們：發揮鍜練自己的力量吧！發捙鍜練自己正確的力量吧！</p>
<h3 id="c238">期待 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>近來常給種種期待的情形苦悶着：如像期待故鄕落雨而故鄕却偏不落雨，期待朋友的踐約而朋友們偏不踐約，等等。</p>
<p>人生本來就在期待的當中，但期待的價值却在能夠償其所願，如果永遠是期待，那就無異於夢想！兩者比較，或者夢想還要較好些，因爲夢是短促的，而期待却長有費去很多的時間，所得的僅是失望和幻滅的結果。</p>
<p>看看天不落雨，還是早點凖備人工灌田的方法。對於不講信用的朋友，還是根本不要去邀約。這樣便會省去許多煩惱！</p>
<p>空的期待，是無補於實際的。</p>
<h3 id="c239">誤解 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>是必須要透澈的瞭解，但人與人之間常常會發生一種誤解。</p>
<p>「世界上誤解和怠惰，恐怕比欺詐作惡還要誤事」。歌德曾經這樣說過。他又說：「被人誤會，原是我們人類底運命呀」！是的，誤解是不幸的。在我們一生中，常常會誤解别人，也常常會給别人誤解，從這誤解中有時當然不免演出種種錯誤的事。其實世間被誤解的事情，儘多儘多，如像一個主義在甲認爲是正動的，在乙却認爲是反動的了！</p>
<p>一個人自有他的立場，誤解乃由於不澈底，如果不願誤解，就須澈底去探討，如果不能澈底去探討，那就難免誤解一。這就是我對於誤解的結論。</p>
<h3 id="c240">茅盾與「春蠶」 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 靜如</p>
<p>無疑的，在目下的新文壇上，最努力的一個當首推茅盾先生了。</p>
<p>他不僅在產量方面較其他作家爲多，</p>
<p>就是在作品的實質方面，也較其他作家爲充實。我們很少看到他一篇疏懈的小說，甚至一章，一節以及一句，都從來是精心地規畫，佈置，構結而成的。</p>
<p>二年來，茅盾先生放棄了五四時代的追述而縱目在正在黑暗中的社會，加以暴露，加以指示是很明顯的能在他這時期中的作品反映出來。「春蠶」便可以作爲這類作品的代表作。</p>
<p>在「春蠶」中，茅盾先生的寫實的手腕是出人意表的。這故事的發生是在江蘇中部或鄰近浙江的鄕村中。他不僅把這部分地方的風土人情寫得使人看了有如身歷其境，而且，把農村中的兩代人物的個性個别生描寫得非常逼眞。此外，現社會給與農村　民的苦悶，也在字裏行間絲毫不誇張地呼喊了出來。這是其他以農村實况爲題材的新文藝作家們所不及的。</p>
<p>現在，這故事是給明星公司所採用而改編攝製爲電影了。而導演又恰是以寫實手腕獨到的程步高先生。我想，「春蠶」是必然的成爲今日寫實影片的最成功的一張。</p>
<p>新文藝界與電影界的携手成功了。我們期待着隨着「春蠶」而上銀幕的新文藝作品的出現，文學與電影的更密切的融合！</p>

<p>第十七回　孰能情家思灰士氣　兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>田青道：怎麽不賭？我要是想到這裏，就什麽也不要幹，只想打一仗，出這一口子氣，輸贏生死，那全没關係。趙自强笑道：你這呌瞎找急，我們一個當連長的人，有多大的能耐，便是帶了一連人出去打一仗，那又夠幹什麽的。這除非咱們師長像你一樣，要這麽一個面子，也許可以作一點顏色出來。田青還不曾答復出來呢，他連下的司務長趕了來，說是雜貨店裏夥計跟煤店裏掌櫃來要錢等着回信呢。他就將、肩膀扛抬兩下，笑道：你聽見没有？若是我走開了這債主子又得發急了。說畢，他轉身去了。走了十幾步，他又很快的跑了回來，向趙自强笑道：我只管說閑話，把正事全忘了。你今天到海甸去不去？趙自强道：我曉得，凖是要我給你帶一封掛號信。田青笑道：你什麽時候去？趙自强道：你别指望着我誤了事，你派人上海甸送去罷。田青笑道：你不知道，我這裏頭，有一點兒困難。那隨從兵老是和我送信，差不多隔三天一封掛號信，我有點不好意思讓他知道了。趙自强笑道：你放心得了。你帮過我的忙，我一定也得帮帮你的忙。我若是有功夫回家去，我一定得求求我老爺子，向黄女士家裏去一趟，把我們分不開身來的話，對他們說上遍，那麽，黄女士對你也就可以諒解了。田青站在對面，好象有許詐多多話要說，可是他想了一想，並不曾說什麽話，只歎了一口氣，掉轉頭也就走了。趙自强看了他那種情形，心裏頭也就想着，看這個情形，田青心裏那分難過，大槪是不亞於我。我一個，他一個，關耀武一個，我們三個人的情形，都有些不同。（二一六）</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>一星期前的一個夜裏，天氣是那麽熱而悶，除了用安眠藥强迫睡覺以外，我簡直没法兒闔上眼皮。到後來實在受不住了，便悄悄的下了床，開了電燈，用冷水洗了臉，擦了身，從一堆舊書堆裏抽出一本小說月報躺在籐椅上胡亂的翻着看。</p>
<p>在白熱的燈光下看書，似乎更熱了。汗直流，没有停止過，身上的衣服濕得好像是剛從游泳池裏爬了起來一般。只得把籐椅搬到窗前，</p>
<p>關了電燈，躺在上面，不停的揮着扇子，睜大了眼睛望着窗外。</p>
<p>夜是靜悄悄的，萬籟無聲。月兒掛在天空，已經缺了一個角。没有雲。星兒稀稀疏疏的點綴在蔚藍的天幕上。偶而來一陣風，但是熱的；吹在身上，也許能吹出一陣汗。</p>
<p>這是多麽美麗的月夜啊。可惜熱！</p>
<p>我在胡思亂想。思想彷彿是一匹脫了韁的馬兒，不知道溜到那兒去了。究意思想些什麽，我不白。我只明白，我在胡思亂想。月兒，星兒，雲，風，太陽，雨，雪，家庭慘變，將來兩個孩子的敎育費，妻時常生病，日本人佔據東北四省，我家的黑貓和同居的黄貓打架的事兒，似乎全想到，似乎全在我腦海裏溜躂過</p>
<p>但是，我還是熱，汗直流。心裏也更覺得煩躁了。</p>
<p>隔壁的鐘敲了兩下。</p>
<p>「𪡊：：：喔：：：」旣不像羊呌，又不像狼嘷。「啊，鬼呌」！</p>
<p>我從籐椅上直跳了起來。渾身的汗毛全開始起竪。一身冷汗趕走了悶熱。</p>
<p>「𪡊：：：喔：：：」浪蹄子，你要瞧麽？我就没有穿褲子啊。哈，哈，哈！𪡊：：：喔：：：」</p>
<p>我意識到這是人在說話，便吐了一口輕鬆氣。渾身也「解嚴」了。我又學着漸漸的熱了。</p>
<p>可是，他爲什麽要「𪡊：：：喔：：：」呢？</p>
<p>「𪡊：：：喔：：：小舅子，哈哈，小舅子，小兎葸子，老子算在你面前，栽了觔斗啦！咱們來世再算賬。惡有惡報，小兎葸子，聽着，别那麽狠！𪡊：：：喔：：：」</p>
<p>聲音是從對門來的。我站在窗前往對們瞧。可是没見瞧見一個人。這傢伙愈「𪡊：：：喔······」的嚷得起勁，聲音是愈變得悽慘了。我不忍聽。但，我又給好奇心所驅，仍是站在那兒往對門瞧，靜靜的聽這悽慘的聲音。</p>
<p>我搬在這兒住了三個多月，從來没有聽見過這種聲音。也許是這傢伙時常「𪡊：：：喔：：：的亂嚷，可也說不定；不過，我没有機會聽到。借了月光，瞧了床上的妻一眼，覺得女人在家没事兒做，挺愛東家長，西家短的管閒事，這回事兒，妻凖知道的；我想喊醒了妻，問伊是誰這樣半夜三更的亂嚷，又爲什麽没有人干涉。走到床前，覷着酣睡的妻臉上浮着微笑，又不願意驚醒了新病初愈的妻。打算明天問伊。我便回到窗前，躺在籐椅上聽着這種勾起我莫名的悲哀的聲音。一直聽到天上已經泛成魚</p>
<p>肚色，才糢糊的在悽慘的聲音裏睡着。</p>
<p>第二天早晨醒來，已是八點三刻，怱怱的擦了一把臉到公司裏去辦公。昨天夜裏的事兒，忘了問妻，到了公司，便奉令到外埠分公司去調查一件公事，三天以後回來，就這樣忘了。　　今天吃了晚飯，給蓓蓓（五歲的女兒）拉到門口乘凉。弄堂裏的人很多。我聽他或她們講賭經正有與趣的時候，忽然對門的後門開了，從裏面跳出一個男人。頭上戴一頂没有邊的草帽，上身穿一件小坎肩，赤脚拖一雙破鞋子，可是，啊，他却没有穿褲子！</p>

<h3 id="c268">識字與用字 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 高植</p>
<p>日前看到蟄存君要人讀莊子與文選，頗想說兩句話，昨天看到豐之餘君的文章，在覺得施君的確有點「過敏」之外，還對於他的話有些懷疑。</p>
<p>中學生的「字彙」太小，這話我們有相當的承認。不過施君看了中學生的文章而有此經騐，我也看過中學生的文章（這與我的履歷無關），我的意見却不如施君之籠統。中學生字彙少有兩方面看法，（我有這當不限於中學生，）一是他用的字彙少，一是他讀的字彙少，平常我們所用的字一定比所識的少，施君喜用舊詞藻，我們却不敢說施君字彙只是所用的那末多。中學生的字彙少，不一定是識的少，乃是年齡與經騐有限，還不能運用他所認識的字，我自己做英文作文也有過這經騐。認字多不一定就會用，這是我對於施君的意見。</p>
<p>卽使中學生的字彙少是由於識字少，但文選與莊子是否就可以加增他們手的字彙是頗成問題的。這兩部書的字有多少是現在可用的也還成問題，施君寫小說偶而用山賦及海賦裡的字，我們也有時覺得生澀。我們多認字彙有時是爲着讀古書，有時却是知識方面的，多認字彙而讀古書，不一定要在文章中表現出來。用字與識字雖然有「相關」，却不是一件事。</p>
<p>莊子及文選是不是準可以使人參悟做文章的方法呢？這對於一部份人也許是的。但我却疑惑。郁達夫先生說過中國的新文學是繼承世界文學的系統的，卽如施君寫的小說及做的詩也許是用的外國方法吧？或者施君過「敏」，獨有心得，但一人的意見未必能使人也同樣獲得。現在的文章我認爲是逐漸擴大地採用外國的方法了。自然我們的祖先也留給我們不少。我覺得要中學生去讀文選舉莊子而學文章作法及增加字彙，是一件出力不討巧的事。若使有人竟相信施君的話而讀文選與莊子，而且是去學習文章作法及增加字彙，一旦應用起來，施君會想到有什麽結果呢？</p>
<p>「没有經過古文學的修養，魯迅徺生的新文章决不會寫到現在那樣好。」爲什麽許多國學家也不會寫新文章呢？這是思想與觀念成熟與否的問題。若是思想與觀念成熟了，有了夠用的字彙，定可寫出文章，否則讀十部莊子也無用。目前有許多人寫文章很好，我知道他們就與莊子文選没有什麽關係。與其要中學生花功夫讀莊子文選，查字典，學文章作法，不如把這功夫用在思想與觀念的訓練上及新知識的增加上。但我不是反對查字典及讀古文學。施君雖然不希望青年人都去做古文，然而這兩種古文著作並不能給青年如施君所期的結果。</p>

<p>食堂遇小林，因向他借「周作人書信」。看書揩油，此年來大轉變亦可云大進步也。首讀序信，意甚佳，便拿到講堂—語鄕某公講席—去看，某公音聲不洪，我也專心注在書上，偶爾抬頭看看他的眼睛，感與黑板通一兩次眼綫，要不過對住吾鄕某先生而已，所以亦不甚覺得牽惹注意，此爲講堂看書之第一次大成功。下堂仍把卷未釋，甚至到了每日腹中作響之際而亦不覺得，等到鳴非來呌，始闔卷之食堂，而心存「信」上，平林說我吃得太慢，亦因心中有事也。飯後又繼續看，不半句鐘，完卷，於是端水漱口，合眼入睡，醒來，氣大佳，再倒熱茶漱口，嚥下一兩口，適有蜂子來，便以水噴之，去，又復來，則更追而噴之，到三四口，蜂伏地不動，始入室，研墨作記，欲尚論豈明之文。夫豈明之文，甚妙，妙在何處？有三：一·我在講堂能看牠；二·看牠時腹響不覺；三·飯後竟至破例，看書之後才睡。有此之一，便非易易，矧三妙而兼有之？如何妙法？則亦有說：我說：他的文章，字字清新，句句平淡，即此清新平淡，便很難得時。下君子作文，新則新點，然意德沃阿基之類太多太多，粗曉英文如我者，也很難趕得上來，自然我并非標準英文通，不能以我之不懂，便抹殺他人以爲都不懂也。豈明書信，確有些句子很新很新的，然絶不至於使我莫明其土地堂—其中錄的一首什麽時，我覺頗有費解難懂之處，然此并非豈明老人之作，且他所錄的受事者亦係積學之士如平伯，廢名，南旡諸公，不學如我，所以不懂，其咎固不在抄者耳—句子短短的，看慣了二三十個字一句要按圖索驥式去讀的的譯文或「原文」，亦覺别有意思。凡此，還不過清新而已。豈明老人，旣没有什麽必要宣傳的敎義，或必捧必倒，必嗔必喜的對象，所以寫來只是平平淡淡，無文章家的所謂險筆，而我郤正是一個平日最愛臧否人物，堅執是非的人，所以一看這書信，便也恬淡下來，稍有仰面看雲之意了，此亦一大快事，近來很少遇之。老人的生活，要比我們（大胆的用了一個們字，想我的一些朋友亦頗有同感也）優適得多，然而說寫文章，或有暇無閑，或有閑暇而無心意，寫文章要靠「逼」與「還債」，或竟把「貓子」（這是豈明先生預備寫的一篇小品）放在心中過了年，仍讓她在屋簷邊呌而終没有把她拿到紙上來，是則我們這班耗神精，於講堂之中，盡思想於生活（註：民生問題也）之上的窮學生之無文章可寫，亦不無可以自解，解潮了。</p>

<p>— 廖伯坦</p>
<p>初秋的黄昏裏，古老的城中籠着一重死樣的靜寂。</p>
<p>我，躑躅在一個荒草遍地的廣塲上。　　風過處，暗示着寒冬將臨的風過處，傳來了爲生活而嘶啞了喉嚨的呌聲，野犬的狂吠，以及殘葉的瑟瑟的音響。，吹到身上有點微凉，「啊！又是一年的秋天了！」這般想着。</p>
<p>遠處，一團兵士坐在草地休息，是「我覺得」吧，我們没有笑，没有談話，臉上像罩了一層陰沉的面網。</p>
<p>一個老年的乞丐，發着凄厲的聲音，顫慄地，無力地，給自己道盡了一切可憐的形容詞，給他人戴遍了一切尊貴的冠冕，懇求每個「善人」的施與，可是「善人」都急急地走過了。</p>
<p>我出神的望着一株柳樹的葉子發怔：牠儘是沉默的拂着拂着，秋天的風呵。</p>
<p>這一切都緊住了我的心，緊緊地，我苦痛且懶散的往前走去，像一隻日暮失羣的烏鴉。</p>
<p>抬頭，那邊電燈發着慘白的光芒；風更大了，行人逐漸稀少：：：</p>

<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>囗囗兄：</p>
<p>所謂「鹽池」，是怎樣的一種搆造呢？在上一封信裏，我已經說過，在廣大的沙灘上面，有墳塚似的一堆一堆的土，這土堆就是已經漉過了鹽汁重復從鹽池裏掘起的那作爲「削灰」的沙呢。這旁邊就是「鹽池。」鹽池的搆造，在地面上，掘一塊長方形的凹地，用泥土砌起邊來，凹地的大小是不一的。但最低限度，總有一丈來長，寬約七八尺。這鹽池，在深度的中間，密密的砌了一排蘆柴，使水僅僅能流了下去。同時，在這側面，在地下有一個深深的嵌在地裏的盛滷的木桶，這桶大小深淺是不一的了我所看到的，就有兩丈深，對周一丈的，上面有圓形的或方形的一尺五寸見方的蓋。這桶口與　滷的那池是連接的，使滷能從那池裏流出，淌到桶裏去。</p>
<p>已經把灰倒到池裏了，在那蘆柴上面，接着的工作，就是「挑水。」强健的男女性的工作者，帶了擔子從鹽池一直走到海邊，把海水一擔擔的挑來，向池裏的泥土上澆，使這些水帶着泥土裏的鹽汁流到蘆柴下，再流入盛滷的大木桶中，這就成了「鹽滷。」而被冲漉的土，這時再被挑到池旁堆着，俟工作完畢時重行舖到地面上去，讓海水再度來播散鹽種，這就是說再候海潮的來。凝成了滷，流入桶内，這木桶，名字呌做「鹽井。」但手續，仍舊不這樣就夠，再下一步，就是要測這滷汁的厚薄濃淡，看看它的質量。這測量的工具呌做「蓮子。」這「蓮子」，據說是產在寗波，可不是吃的那種蓮子。用一個普通打油的小油釣子，幾個蓮子放在釣子裏，釣子的口用鐵絲網起。用桶打起滷</p>
<p>來，把蓮子放了進去，看蓮子的浮起的程度，就知道滷的質量。那盛滷的桶，有時用磁缸；不過，在鹽灶旁的，大都是木製的。滷成功了，如果要燒鹽，隨時可以挑到鹽灶裏去，不燒，就可以用「草筋」將桶口封起。</p>
<p>這裏，有一說「鹽灶」構成的必要了。一般的灶是很大的，總要佔三間屋的地位。所謂鍋，大抵是六塊或者八塊大的平鐵版拚成，縫隙處不時用泥筋去塗滿，以免下漏。這些版上用</p>
<p>鐵柱弔起，弔在屋頂柱上，以防墮，下面就因土作灶。灶長約二丈，寬丈餘。在灶後有大的滷缸以及盛海水的缸，上面有小的滷桶，接近着盛鹽盤的一個桶，以小竹筒直連盤内。在燒時，先將滷倒入滷桶，使它從竹管内流出，經過管口的　籃（此作熝清之用），流到盤内。就這樣的開始燒鹽。大約要經過一點半鐘，一船鹽才可以燒成。在中間，還有手續，就是過乾時要攪海水，燒得將乾時要用剷翻身，攤匀，使它成爲鹽時爲止。在鹽燒開以後，也可以說還没有燒老時拿起，那呌做「鹽精」，但這祇是燒鹽的人家留着自己吃，或者潄口用，一般的却要完全燒好，再剷入蘿内，挑到倉内藏起，再打包裝運出去。</p>
<p>鹽就是這樣製成的。到這裏，我要附帶的介紹一些關於製鹽的工具的名稱和術語了。削灰用的削刀也呌做「拖床」。把削起的灰再舖平用「灰攤」，舖平的術語是「落灰，」把舊泥墾出用「鐵爬」，呌做「墾遭。」把新灰放進去呌做「收灰」，用「推爬」，「爬頭」，「絲擔。」然後，是挑灰「落漕」的工作，用「滷桶」和「弔子。」以下是踏平的工作呌做「塡漕。」是倒水的工作，用「滷桶。」二日後、就是過滷入井，呌做「跳滷」或者「頓滷。」至於燒鹽時，所用的工作，大抵是「丫剷」，「長火义」，「鹽抄」，「舀滷」料，「打滷弔」，「料桶」，「調灰抄」，「撤灰爬」等。就我所知，大抵如此，不知有遺漏或錯誤没有？　八月二十六日</p>

<p>老漁人用力的吸着這種臭氣，好像人家吸着藩薇的香氣一樣，說道：</p>
<p>「啊！眞新鮮，這些魚！」</p>
<p>隨後他繼續纔說道：</p>
<p>「你釣到了多少！你，醫生？」</p>
<p>他的大兒子筆爾，一個三十歲的漢子，頰上的黑色鬍子剪得像司法官的一樣，嘴唇和下顎的鬍剃得光光的，回答他道：</p>
<p>「啊！不多，祗有三四條。」</p>
<p>父親轉身問次子道：</p>
<p>「你呢，哲安？」</p>
<p>哲安是個長着金黄色頭髮的修長的少年，滿臉鬍鬚，却比他的哥哥現得年輕很多，微笑着輕輕回答：</p>
<p>「和筆爾差不多，不過四五條罷了。」</p>
<p>他們每次老是說着這使得羅蘭老爹開心的謊話。</p>
<p>他把釣絲纏在漿架上，兩臂义在胸前，說道：</p>
<p>「我以後下午决不再釣魚了。十點鐘一過，這就完了。魚不再來上釣了，牠在太陽底下睡午睡。」</p>
<p>這位老實漢子以一種業主的滿足的神氣瞧着他周圍的水。</p>
<p>這是以前巴黎的一個手飾商人，因爲非常喜歡航海和釣魚的緣故，當他剛剛有點積蓄，可以靠着利息儉樸的生活下去時，他便從賬櫃裏抽身出來了。</p>
<p>他退隱在哈佛爾，買了一隻船，成了一個非職業的水手了。他的兩個兒子筆爾和哲安，留在巴黎繼續上學，有時趁着假期回來和他們的父親分享着釣游的樂趣。</p>
<p>中學畢業後，大的一個筆爾，比哲安長五歲，接連地感到自己對於種種職業的長處，一樣一樣地試了半打，對於每種職業都很快的感到厭倦，立刻投在另一些新的希望中。</p>
<p>最後，醫學引起了他的興趣，於是他便異常熱心的研究起醫學來，結果竟在頗爲短促的研究，和在敎育部長那邊取得縮短修業年限的特典之後，新近通過了醫生試騐。他是一個熱狂，聰明，易變而又固執的人，他充滿了空想和哲學的念頭。</p>
<p>哲安和他的哥哥剛好相反：他的哥哥長着黑頭髮，他長着金黄的頭髮；他的哥哥暴燥，他却寗靜；他的哥哥恨心狠重，他却非常温從。他安穩穩地學着法律，新近，他的哥哥取得了醫生的文憑，他也同時取得了法學士的文憑。</p>
<p>於是兩兄弟都回家來休息一下，並且，如果情形好的話，兩人都想在哈佛爾執行業務。</p>
<p>可是一種模糊的嫉妒，一種在兄弟姊妹間一天天擴大起來，直到成年還硑不多看不出來，要遇到其中一個結婚或是得到一種意外的幸福時才會暴發起來的那樣隱伏着的嫉妒，使得兩人在一種兄弟的，無害的親密狀態中彼此警戒着。不錯，他們都友愛，但他們却彼此覬覦着。筆爾的年齡比哲安大了五歲，他帶着一種被寵愛的小畜生的敵意，瞧着另一個小畜生突然出現在他父母親的手臂中，且被他們那樣痛愛着，撫弄着。</p>

Japanese Troops in the War Zone Gradually Withdraw; Order Restored in Shunyi County Seat <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) The Military Council dispatched Huang Shiyue, Chief of the Third Division, and Lü Ji, Chief of Staff of the Thirty-second Army, along with 30,000 yuan in cash and 20,000 catties of steamed buns, traveling in seventeen cars to the Dongjiazhuang area to handle the matter of sheltering Fang Ji’s troops. Subsequently, due to the number of people reaching over ten thousand, with more than three thousand guns, the amount of money was insufficient for distribution. This morning, the Thirty-second Army advanced another 10,000 yuan to send to the front lines. The roll call, gun collection, and salary distribution have all been completed this afternoon. Huang will return to Peiping tonight to meet with He and report on the shelter process. Some of the collected firearms have already been transported to Peiping and stored at the Thirty-second Army headquarters. The sheltered troops are scheduled to march to Peiping on foot tomorrow and be transferred to Baoding, where they will be handed over to the Training Department to begin training. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Military News: After Fang Ji deserted from his rebellious troops, the officers and soldiers concentrated in the Sunhezhen area. The Military Council instructed Commander Gao of the Thirty-second Army and Division Commander Guan of the Twenty-fifth Division to disarm and disband them nearby. It is reported that the number of disbanded personnel includes 294 officers, 136 soldiers, and 86 students from Fang’s main force; approximately 3,000 officers and soldiers from Zhao Chengkai’s division under Fang; 390 officers and 81 soldiers from Zhu Wenhe’s division; approximately 200 cavalry from Wang Ying’s division; and over 100 horses.

<p>(Peiping) Japanese troops began withdrawing toward Niulanshan and Huairou yesterday afternoon. To prevent disturbances by Fang Ji, the northwest gates of Shunyi County had been blocked, but they have now been opened. Merchants and residents inside the city have resumed business as usual, and order in the war zone is gradually being restored. After being disarmed near Liujiahe, several thousand remnants of Fang Ji’s troops have successively moved to Qianhoushayu, Tiangezhuang, and other places, preparing for repatriation.

Wu Jiaxiang and Yao Hong were present. Huang Fu chaired. Zhang Boling, Fu Zuoyi, and Wang Boqun were unable to attend. The meeting began with reports on various cases, followed by discussions. (1) On the Chahar Province Relief Request Case, it was resolved to first allocate 100,000 yuan to the Chahar Provincial Government to handle emergency relief in Chahar Province, and to separately telegraph the Central Government to increase relief funds for various counties in Zhangbei. (2) On the Request for Return of Agricultural Irrigation Funds Case, it was resolved to request the Central Government to return previously diverted funds and to pay interest at a rate of five percent per annum until the funds are fully repaid.

After arriving in Peiping, he met with He Yingqin and indicated that the armies in North China had been reduced in size and that Shandong Province was now planning to reduce the size of its troops. Feng Yuxiang is doing well in Mount Tai. The original intention of welcoming Feng to Shandong was to appease the situation and calm people's minds, with more consideration for the public than for private matters. However, the expenses for Feng's personal use and the salaries of his guards are considerable, and Shandong Province's financial difficulties cannot sustain this for long. He plans to discuss a solution with Huang and He. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) At today's Political Reorganization Committee meeting, Huang gave a brief report on his trip south. There were also discussions on the internal organization of the committee and relief efforts in the Hebei war zone. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) A telegram from Zhangyuan: Zhao Dengyu telegraphed that the three bandit gangs of Sun Meilong, Xiaotian Youzi, and Yangyan Erzi in Zhangbei were blocked and suppressed along separate routes by himself and Zhang Yunrong's troops.

<h3 id="e6">The Circumstances of Fang Ji Leaving the Army <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Since Fang Ji expressed his intention to leave the army, Fang had sent a representative to the Peiping authorities to discuss the conditions. The final decision was: (1) Fang Ji must leave the army; (2) Protect Fang Ji's life and safety; (3) Subsidize Fang Ji's travel expenses abroad. After the three conditions were decided, Liu Diqian, Director-General of the Peiping Public Welfare Association, and other charitable organizations such as Zhang Yingpei, Lu Dafu, and Cai Cuifu, went to meet with Fang Ji by car on the 9th of this month to explain the three conditions and urge him to step down peacefully. Fang, seeing that the general situation was gone, accepted the negotiated conditions and personally wrote three letters to Chairmen Huang and He and Commander Wan. The general idea of the letters was that the national crisis was urgent and that the use of force was due to disagreements. He felt deep self-blame. Now that representatives from the Peiping charitable organizations had come to his headquarters to compassionately seek peace, he had no choice but to agree. Therefore, he ordered the cessation of attacks from that day forward. Liu and others took the original letter and returned to Peiping that night. At 5 PM on the 14th, he met with He's representative, Gan Kequan, who said that Peiping was determined to guarantee Fang Ji's safety. At 9 PM on the night of the 15th, Liu and others went to the front to meet with Fang Ji to convey Peiping's intentions. At the same time, Fang Ji received threats from the Japanese army, giving him until 3 PM on the 16th to leave the defense zone. Fang then resolutely left with the charitable organization representatives by car at 4 AM on the 16th. After traveling seven or eight li to the Sunhe Bridge area, they suddenly encountered a regiment of a certain army blocking their path and asking if Fang Ji's car was there. Tonight, Chairman Huang was at the water company to meet him. Liu replied that Fang Ji's car was behind and had not arrived yet. The army then withdrew, with one unit going to the rear to investigate and another unit still monitoring the car, forcing it to drive in front of the water company's gate for a strict inspection. Fang, seeing that things were not going well, fled under the pretext of urinating. Ji was still in the car, because everyone did not know Ji. After the inspection, they let it go. After passing Sunhe Bridge for more than ten li, the car encountered obstacles again, and they abandoned the car there. He arrived safely in Peiping on the morning of the 17th and took the Peiping-Ningbo train to Tianjin that night, staying in a private residence in a certain concession. However, Fang's whereabouts have not been determined. Ji said in Tianjin that he would go abroad as soon as the subsidy money arrived. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Radio Station Contract Bonds All Destroyed in the United States <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The former Peking government signed a Sino-US radio contract with the American United Wireless Telegraph Company to establish five radio stations in China, with China and the United States each contributing half of the capital. China was responsible for a total capital of US$6.5 million, which was to be raised by the government issuing bonds to the company. Since the signing of the contract, Japan has repeatedly protested, citing that it conflicted with the Sino-Japanese Shuangqiao Radio Contract, demanding its cancellation in order to achieve its monopoly plan. At that time, the Chinese government, considering that both contracts had been approved by the cabinet, but their spirit was ultimately incompatible, and the United States and Japan did not give way to each other, negotiated for several years, but ultimately failed to resolve the situation due to the overly complicated circumstances. Later, China's political situation was unstable, and wars occurred frequently. Negotiations continued intermittently, rising and falling, but never yielded concrete results. Now, as time has passed and circumstances have changed, the aforementioned two contracts have been virtually canceled, and all unissued bonds still remain in the Chinese legation in the United States. Fearing that they may cause problems over time, the legation has obtained the consent of the US Treasury Department to use its waste bond disposal site to destroy the unissued bonds on September 9. Six thousand five hundred bonds, with a total face value of US$6.5 million, were transported for destruction. The legation's secretary, Xia Jinlin, and Cui Cunlin, together with US Treasury Department official Mu Ren, were sent to the site to supervise, and all were destroyed as counted. According to the Sino-US and Japanese radio station contracts, both were long-wave, costly and of little use. In recent years, after the invention of short-wave radio stations, these types of radio stations were naturally eliminated. Not only can the Sino-US contract be abolished, but the exchange of notes outside of the Shuangqiao Radio Contract signed by Haibu and Mitsui should also be completely abolished. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Representatives of the Peiping Educational Association, including Yu Shiyuan, visited Yuan Liang this morning to mediate the elementary school strike and proposed a solution: on the one hand, requesting the municipal government to borrow money from the bank before the 20th to pay the arrears of elementary school salaries and guarantee that full salaries will be paid in the future; on the other hand, requesting elementary school teachers to return to work immediately. Yuan replied that the central government's assistance funds could not be allocated monthly, so it was difficult to guarantee full salaries in the future. He agreed to consider borrowing money to pay salaries and expressed great dissatisfaction with the elementary school teachers' action of asking the Social Affairs Bureau to give a deadline for a reply. The elementary school teachers' side is preparing to contact the Elementary School Teachers' Association to hold a meeting and discuss the issue of a unified strike if there is no satisfactory reply before the 20th.

<h3 id="e21">How to Remedy the Current Silk Industry Crisis <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Recently, the overseas raw silk market has seen a rush to sell by囤户, leading to sluggish sales. Silk prices have plummeted, with New York spot silk falling below US$1.60 per pound. The European market is also experiencing a sharp decline, creating a sense of great uncertainty. In this pessimistic and turbulent silk market, the hardest hit is none other than China's silk industry.</p>
<p>According to reports, since the sharp decline in overseas silk markets, Zhejiang factory silk B-grade has fallen from 920 yuan per dan to around 700 yuan. Even the latest prices for A-grade factory silk are only worth about 870 yuan per package in Chinese currency. Silk factories in Shanghai are reeling from huge losses due to the silk they have reeled, leading to widespread shutdowns. Of the 64 silk factories that had resumed operations in July due to improved silk market conditions, the majority have been forced to revert to their bleak fate in recent days. It is estimated that up to 2/3 of them have shut down, with only 20 struggling to stay afloat. Even these 20 factories have decided to cut female workers' wages from 50 cents to 42 cents per day, a 16% reduction, in addition to canceling bonuses for promotion ceremonies and silkworm moth worship. While this is just a snapshot of Shanghai, it truly reflects the state of the national silk industry.</p>
<p>The silk industry is a national treasure of China. Since 1516, Chinese silk has been sold overseas and welcomed everywhere as a precious commodity. In 1867, Chen Qiyuan of Guangdong pioneered modern silk factories, transforming the old manual silk industry into a mechanical one. From this point on, China's silk industry began to show signs of improvement. However, since the beginning of the 20th century, Japan has emerged as a strong competitor, using scientific methods and modern machinery to increase production and improve silk quality. The Americas and European countries eagerly purchased Japanese silk. During this period, China's silk industry not only lacked a proactive spirit but also clung to old ways and became complacent. Merchants had limited knowledge and paid little attention to the quality of exported silk. The government also lacked a strict commodity inspection system, leading to inaction and ultimately the irretrievable loss of overseas markets.</p>
<p>After 1929, the global depression erupted, reducing the purchasing power of various countries and further shrinking the market for Chinese silk. Although the value of silver declined during this period, it did little to boost exports. After Japan re-imposed the gold embargo, it used the devaluation of its currency and generous government subsidies to maintain its silk exports, even in the depths of the depression. China's silk industry, however, was left far behind. According to statistics from the past two or three years, Chinese silk exports have declined by more than one-third. The recent sharp drop in overseas silk prices will undoubtedly make exports even more difficult in the future.</p>
<p>This decline in Chinese silk exports is one crisis facing China's silk industry. The increasingly narrow domestic silk weaving market is another. In recent years, natural disasters and human-made calamities have followed one another, severely weakening the consumer power of the general public. At the same time, cheap artificial silk and dumped cotton and wool textiles have flooded the market. Some middle and upper-class consumers are eager to buy these products, attracted by their luster or durability. China's own silk fabrics are now neglected, and despite ubiquitous discount advertisements, silk shops are mostly deserted. Even when there are occasional customers, they mostly buy bright fabrics mixed with artificial silk. Old-fashioned Hangzhou silk and Huzhou crepe silk are rarely purchased. The decline of the silk weaving industry directly harms the silk industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to remedy the silk industry today, we must act on two fronts. On one hand, we must find ways to expand overseas markets. On the other hand, we must strive to promote the domestic market. However, these two strategies cannot be achieved overnight or through empty talk. In the former case, we must understand the reasons for the decline in Chinese silk exports in the past, thoroughly correct past mistakes, and catch up. At the same time, we must rely on strong government support to actively promote silk sales. While we may not be able to regain the top position in the world silk market, we can at least compete with our strong rivals in the East and West. Regarding the latter, we do not have specific suggestions at this time. How to restore the purchasing power of the general Chinese public is an economic issue with political undertones, and it cannot be solved with just a few words. The call to boycott foreign goods and promote domestic products is certainly a quick fix, but it is not a cure.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of talk about controlled economy. The current decline of the silk industry urgently calls for control. If the entire silk industry collapses, the direct result will be the emergence of millions of unemployed workers. Indirectly, the silkworm cocoon sideline of all Chinese farmers will also collapse, creating a huge social problem.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council met on the 18th to discuss the Finance Group's review of the Hunan Provincial Government's issuance of 10 million yuan in construction bonds. It is proposed to modify the six principles proposed by the Executive Yuan as follows: (1) The bond amount is limited to 10 million yuan; (2) The purpose is to use one-third to repay old debts to banks and two-thirds to build the Baohong light rail railway; (3) The annual interest rate is 6%; (4) The repayment period is 10 years; (5) The guarantee is the property deed tax and business tax revenue of southern Hunan Province as the first guarantee, and the operating revenue of the Baohong Railway as the second guarantee; (6) The method of custody: The fund should be deposited in the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Shanghai and the Hunan Provincial Bank, and a custodial committee composed of government personnel and financial industry leaders designated by the Executive Yuan should be organized to manage it. Three accompanying suggestions: 1. The two-thirds of the bond proceeds designated for road construction should be handed over to the custodial committee for custody in accordance with the fund custody method for public bonds, and used exclusively for road construction expenditures; 2. The surveying and alignment of the road and the technical design and other work should be handled by the Ministry of Railways, and personnel should be dispatched by the Ministry of Railways to preside over the construction project; 3. When necessary, the Ministry of Railways has the right to recover the road from the provincial government at a considerable price. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Seattle – After U.S. Secretary of the Navy Claude Swanson inspected the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, he returned here today. He told people that if his plan succeeds, the U.S. Navy will not lag behind others in the world. According to Washington sources, Swanson's plan for naval construction is likely to be fulfilled. Before Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference, many in U.S. military circles believed that after the Disarmament Conference reached a disarmament agreement, it would be possible to open the way for major powers to significantly reduce their navies in 1936. Now, even those close to the U.S. President say that regardless of whether Geneva can reach an agreement this year or next, the U.S.'s original naval plan is unlikely to change.</p>
<p>Some naval officers have heard that Britain may suggest changing the naval construction plan to limit the maximum displacement of cruisers for each country to 7,000 tons. Given the tense situation in Europe, it is expected that both Britain and the U.S. will maintain the provisions of the existing London Naval Treaty. After Swanson read the reports from Washington and Geneva here, he did not comment, but reiterated his claim that a strong navy is the best guarantee of peace. Swanson did not indicate whether he had any suggestions for improving the naval base in Honolulu. However, it was learned from other sources that Swanson seemed to pay more attention to the need to improve some buildings than to fortifications. Swanson also said that the main purpose of his trip was to understand the true nature and current status of the naval facilities in each base, and whether they needed repair and improvement. The Secretary of the Navy must know these things in detail in order to request funds from Congress or approve or reject the requests of naval officers. Swanson will now inspect the Bremerton Naval Shipyard near here, and then visit the Mare Island Naval Shipyard and San Diego near San Francisco. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Labor Party's newspaper, the "Daily Herald," reported that the British Admiralty not only demanded that it engage in shipbuilding within the scope of the naval treaty, but also planned to replace old ships. The Admiralty expects that the naval treaty will expire on December 30, 1936, and that there will be no possibility of extension. It plans to build 25 new cruisers and several ocean-going warships of 25,000 tons equipped with 12-inch guns. In addition, it also requires the construction of 15 torpedo boats per year to replace 100,000 tons of old ships, and 10,000 tons of submarines. The newspaper also said that the number of naval personnel will also increase by 10,000, and that the Air Force Department also plans to request the construction of a large number of aircraft.

<h3 id="e43">Warlike Nations Refurbish Naval Array, Standing Fleet Reorganized in October, Recruiting Elite to Fully Demonstrate Power <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>▲Tokyo News. The Standing Fleet for the Japanese Navy's ninth fiscal year is scheduled to be implemented on the 15th of next month (November). This newly formed fleet has a new and invincible array, recruiting the elite of the navy. The Japanese authorities attach great importance to the reorganization of this fleet in preparation for emergencies. Among the main forces of the fleet, the giant ships Mutsu, Kongo, and Hyuga, which were active in the eighth fiscal year, will first be withdrawn from the front line in anticipation of the dangerous period of 1935 and 1936. They will be replaced by the Ise, Kirishima, and Fuso, all of which have been remodeled to have great power and a new look. The 7th Squadron will be replaced by the Nagara and Isuzu, replacing the Abukuma and Yura of this year. The 33rd Destroyer Squadron, led by Yubari in the 1st Torpedo Squadron, will take a rest in the name of reserve ships. The light cruiser Sendai (5,195 tons), which has been dormant for a year, will serve as the flagship, enriching the surprise attack force. The 22nd Destroyer Squadron will be replaced by the 29th Destroyer Squadron. The 1st Submarine Squadron will once again be heavily burdened by the mother ship Jingei. The 2nd-class cruiser Yura will be moved from the 7th Squadron and incorporated into the flagship. As for the 1st Air Squadron, which holds air supremacy, the 26,900-ton Akagi and the new small aircraft carrier Ryujo will be included in the fleet, replacing the Kaga and Hosho. The 4th Squadron of the 2nd Fleet, the 10,000-ton ships Chokai, Maya, Atago, and Takao will continue to exert their power. The Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako of the 6th Squadron, which was resurrected last year, will continue to participate for two years. The Jingei will serve as the 2nd Submarine Squadron. In short, this newly formed combined fleet recruits the elite of the Japanese Navy and is sufficient to fully demonstrate the power of the invincible fleet. The most noteworthy feature is the allocation of a submarine squadron, which distinguishes the flagship from the mother ship. The details are listed below.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference has been temporarily postponed, and from Geneva to various European capitals, efforts are now being made to find a way to world peace through disarmament. National representatives are rushing back to their countries to plan how to deal with the emergency situation caused by Germany's actions. U.S. Representative Davis has stated that the United States is only concerned with world disarmament and does not want to be involved in political events. It is widely believed that unless Germany rejoins the talks, disarmament is unlikely to be achieved. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Paris) France's first official reaction to Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference was officially announced today by French Prime Minister Daladier in the National Assembly's House of Representatives. France is prepared to continue to cooperate for peace but is also unwilling to abandon its rights. Subsequently, after the National Assembly listened to the government's budget report, it responded to the government's request for immediate consideration of the budget with a vote of confidence of 470 to 120. It is widely believed that this move by the National Assembly can be regarded as full support for the policy announced by the Prime Minister. Daladier did not use any radical language towards Germany, only stating that France is neither deaf to words nor blind to actions. He believes that negotiations should continue and asks rhetorically, "If you want to reconcile, why break up first? If you are willing to accept complete disarmament, why can't you accept a plan that guarantees effective disarmament?" He then declared that France is not isolated and that there are more allies today than since the World War. He also said that France is in a position to protect its territory and independence. He then discussed Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations, saying that this shows that a new element is still needed in the organization of the peace structure. France has already studied this element and continued, "We are prepared to follow a policy of international cooperation regardless. The reasonable attitude we have already expressed and the sacrifices we have made are enough to allow us to maintain this policy. However, our willingness to continue this international cooperation does not mean that we are willing to give up our rights." Finally, he said that France will attend the Disarmament Conference, which will reopen on October 26, in order to follow this policy. After Daladier finished his speech, he submitted the budget proposal. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the House of Representatives approved the government's financial proposal to make up for the budget deficit with 470 votes to 220 votes, making an emergency debate. Although the government proposes to make up for the shortage by increasing taxes and reducing government spending, there are many difficulties. The right wing is prepared to support reducing government spending, but not increasing taxes, while the left wing is the opposite. The government's emergency plan includes special sales tax, gasoline tax, civil servant pension tax, and reform of certain monopolies. In addition, there are also gasoline import tax and military equipment monopoly. The government also hopes to raise 650 million francs through national lotteries. It is difficult to predict whether the government's proposal will pass. If the Daladier government falls, a national mixed cabinet will probably be formed. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon issued a statement today, saying that Britain announced last December that Germany should enjoy equal rights in terms of security. Britain still adheres to this declaration today. However, serious events have already occurred. Although our promises will not be changed, the details of fulfilling this promise must be slightly different. Recent events have made people increasingly fearful. This is the real reason why countries with substantial military preparations hesitate and worry and are unwilling to weaken their armed forces hastily. As a result of our worries, Britain is now more worried about the international situation than it has been for many years, and the European continent is even more worried than Britain. Simon then elaborated on the steps taken in Geneva to accommodate Germany's demands, saying that a compromise was almost reached last week. I then asked Germany what it meant by "sample" weapons. Surprisingly, Germany did not explain the meaning of "sample" but insisted on substantial rearmament. Now, German Foreign Minister Neurath accuses me of distorting the facts. This statement is completely wrong. I can publish various documents and records. Our hard work in good-faith talks, even if not destroyed by Germany's final attitude, has been hindered. He completely cannot accept the reasons given by Germany for its withdrawal. Baldwin once said that any country that makes disarmament impossible will have no friends in the world. This is very true. Britain does not want to cause ill feelings and is willing to find ways to promote good cooperation between countries and to do its utmost to find an honorable way to solve the great problem of humanity's hopes for the future of the world. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) After British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here by plane from Paris today, he immediately went to the Prime Minister's residence to consult with Prime Minister MacDonald and Lord President of the Council Baldwin for an hour. Simon told reporters that German Foreign Minister Neurath stated that the German side had informed the British Foreign Secretary of Germany's views on October 6, but the British Foreign Secretary did not accurately convey these views. He said that he would sincerely regret it if there were discrepancies between him and the German Foreign Minister on the incident. However, the British people can rest assured that the so-called inaccuracies do not belong to the British side. It was found that the German Charge d'Affaires in Britain sent a letter to the British Foreign Secretary on October 6, informing him of Germany's views on disarmament. Germany simultaneously sent the same official document to the Italian government but did not send it to the French and American governments participating in the talks. Because the British Foreign Secretary believed that Germany's opinions were of great importance to the disarmament issue, after research, he immediately recorded a copy and sent it to the French and American ambassadors stationed in London.

<h3 id="e50">"Peace and Equality": Germany Truly Seeks It Day and Night; Hitler Convenes Party Meeting to Promote the Election Campaign <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The leaders of the National Socialist Party and its military convened a meeting. Prime Minister Hitler personally delivered a speech, saying, "Our struggle for equality of rights has now entered the final stage. This struggle is inextricably linked to the German nation's struggle for economic recovery and for daily bread. The pacification of world politics is an indispensable condition for curing chronic economic diseases. Previous German governments believed that it would be beneficial to participate in international conferences before we obtained equality of rights. This was a big mistake, because they were poisoned by 'Geneva' and therefore were pessimistic about Germany itself and optimistic about the League of Nations. I am not. I am quite optimistic about our country and pessimistic about Geneva and the League of Nations. It is precisely because Germany has left the gloomy atmosphere of Geneva that Germany's love of peace is now even greater than before. The German government responds to all humiliating demands with the following sentence: 'We want peace, but we do not want others to treat us, Germany, as a second-class country.' This answer is endorsed by the entire German people. The National Socialist Party has been fighting for rights in Germany for fourteen years. Today, Germany must also maintain its rights in diplomacy with the same determination and perseverance, maintain the demand for equality of rights, honor, and loyalty, which are by no means empty and impractical. Germany wants peace and seeks nothing but peace. In the future, Germany will never sign any alliances and treaties that do not treat Germany equally. There is a limit to leading the people; beyond this limit, it is not justified. Our election propaganda is extremely important, because this election will be a moral test and a struggle for national rights related to life and death. The National Socialist Party members' love of peace is probably greater than anyone else in Germany, because National Socialism is theoretically based on bloodline laws and racial concepts and is an internal movement. Therefore, any imperialist policy of external aggression is despised. However, when necessary, we can also have the determination to protect our due rights, which is the same as our rejection of violent policies. Our party's election campaign should focus on this serious issue, and any secondary issues may be temporarily put aside. In the coming weeks, the German nation will be filled with a deep and sacred sense of seriousness. The passionate emotions of the Germans are not merely emotions expressed on the surface but are based on a deep belief in due rights. The German nation can have this attitude entirely because of its belief in the leader, because these leaders know the importance of their responsibilities and duties and will do their best to fulfill them." Hitler then elaborated on the necessity of the future election, saying that it would be sufficient to prove the freedom of National Socialism. "The National Socialist Party has begun the great task of re-assisting within the German nation, and it must be completed in the future. This struggle is for the benefit of the entire country. Therefore, even our domestic enemies, we are willing to carry on friendly terms with them, but only on one condition: that they must voluntarily promote the honor of the German nation and love peace." Finally, he called on the National Socialist Party to abide by discipline internally. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The authorities issued a semi-official statement, firmly stating that Germany intends to abide by the articles of the peace treaty and the League of Nations covenant.

<p>(Geneva) The official notice of Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet been delivered to the Secretariat of the League of Nations. Therefore, people here say that the German government may have changed its attitude and does not want to move towards a breakdown. However, the responsible parties in Geneva consider this statement to be false. It is generally believed that Germany's departure from Geneva will affect some of the work of the League of Nations, such as the resolution of the minority issue, which is the most important one. However, some people believe that although Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it will still participate in some international conferences, such as the London World Economic Conference. In short, Germany's rupture, at first glance, does not seem to cause insurmountable obstacles to the activities of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) When German Foreign Minister Neurath entertained foreign journalists on Monday evening, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels was also present and talked with the foreign journalists. Mr. Bryce, a special reporter for the London Daily Mail, was also among those invited. Bryce asked Goebbels whether Germany would soon rearm. Goebbels replied, "No, Germany has complied with the provisions of the treaty and disarmed, but it cannot but demand that other countries also abide by their promises and disarm as well." Bryce then asked how Hitler's recent speech and his new book "Mein Kampf" would be reconciled with his feelings towards France. Goebbels immediately replied that Hitler's proposal to reconcile with France could prove the evolution of the German National Socialist Party. The German people's feelings towards France have changed significantly in recent years. Once the Saar region is returned to Germany, Germany will no longer have any other territorial demands on France. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, all newspapers published the speeches of French Prime Minister Daladier and British Foreign Secretary Simon.

Political circles said that if Simon said that his speech in Geneva last Saturday was not the main cause of Germany's surprising actions, he must be asked to correct it, because Neurath and Nadolny had stated during their previous talks with Simon that the conditions listed in his Saturday speech were unacceptable to Germany.

On the morning of the 17th, Uchida Seiji (37 years old), the most likely suspect, was found wandering around the US consulate in Nagoya City and was arrested. Uchida remained silent during the authorities' rigorous interrogation. However, based on various materials, Uchida is undoubtedly the culprit. The Aichi Prefecture Police Department was very pleased to have captured this criminal. (Electric Communication dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Manchu gunboat Limin arrived here today. It is reported that the ship captured three Soviet Russian secret agents. One was in uniform, and the other two were in plain clothes. According to the Manchu authorities, the three were captured near Daheihe in Manchuria. Since the three were sent here, the Russian Consul General here and the representative of the "Manchu Foreign Ministry" have protested to each other. The Russian Consul's protest stated that the three were captured in Soviet Russia and therefore demanded their release. The Manchu authorities claimed that they were captured in Manchuria and believed that the Russian side deliberately undermined the sovereignty of the border territory of "Manchukuo."

<p>Bangkok The situation of the Siamese revolution suddenly turned this afternoon. The navy almost unanimously supports the current government. It is expected that the end of the revolution is imminent. At 5:00 PM today, the main force of the revolutionary army retreated from Bangkok to Korat. It is expected that Siam will not be threatened again for the time being. Eighteen government planes flew over Chachoengsao, dropping several bombs as a warning, and sent a ship to open fire several times. The large revolutionary army in the area immediately surrendered. As a result, the railway south of Bangkok has been restored, and it is expected that it will return to normal within a few days. The revolutionary army near Siam gradually began to withdraw last night. The Korat Airfield was evacuated first and reoccupied by government forces. Initially, it was expected that the revolutionary army would pretend to retreat to lure the government army out of the city to ambush them. However, the situation today seems to indicate that the revolutionary army has lost its momentum. Seven government planes have crashed in three days. The seventh one crashed on the roof of the government's palace on Monday morning. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that the communist bandits Xiao Ke and Cai Huiwen led the false 17th and 18th Divisions, numbering over 10,000 men and carrying 5,000 to 6,000 guns, and on the 13th</p>
<p>Advanced on Pingxiang and Liling in three routes. The people of the provincial capital were greatly disturbed. He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Army, was on the 9th, returned to the province from Pingxiang via Xiangdong to participate in the National Day commemoration. He was originally scheduled to return to Pingxiang by special train at 8 a.m. on the 13th to convene a meeting of the Western Route Army generals to discuss the suppression of the bandits, but due to the bandit Xiao's attack, he suspended his departure and remained in Changsha. At 9 a.m. today (the 16th), various party, government, and military circles held an enlarged memorial week in Zhongshan Hall. He Jian personally attended and reported on the recent situation of bandit suppression in the Pingli area, saying that the siege of Pingxiang has been lifted, and the Western Route Army launched a pursuit on the 16th before dawn.</p>
<p>An excerpt from his report is as follows: "I (He referring to himself) originally scheduled to leave the province on the morning of the 13th on an inspection tour, but on the evening of the 12th, I received a report that the two bandits Xiao Ke and Cai Huiwen led all the bandits out of Yongxin, attacking Pingli in three routes. The central route, with about three to four thousand men, attacked Pingxiang from Daluli; the right wing, with about three to four thousand men, attacked Pingxiang from Lugongbei; and the left wing, with about two to three thousand men, attacked Liling from Meitianqiao. At that time, our army in Pingxiang only had one regiment of Liu Jianwen, and Meitianqiao only had two companies of security regiment soldiers stationed in bunkers. The military strength was vastly different, and the situation was tense. That night, I urgently dispatched the two regiments of He Shisheng and Ouyang Xin to rush to the aid of Liling Meitianqiao on the morning of the 13th. At the same time, I rushed to compile three detachments to rush to the aid of Pingxiang overnight. The 62nd Division Commander Tao Guang's troops were compiled into one detachment, gathering in Pingnan to fight nearby; the 19th Division Commander Li Jue's troops were compiled into one detachment, departing from Changsha by special train to Liling on the morning of the 13th, then transferring to Pingxiang; and the 63rd Division Chen Guangzhong's troops and the 16th Division Commander Peng Weiren's troops were combined into one detachment, rushing to the aid of Pingxiang from Lianhua. On the morning of the 14th, the Xiao bandits occupied Mashan, twenty li away from Pingxiang. The front line had already reached Qibao and Shanwan, six li away from the city. Pingxiang was besieged. Fortunately, Commander Tao arrived and engaged the bandits fiercely near Mashan, resulting in many casualties on both sides for several hours. Fortunately, two airplanes arrived and bombed, killing many bandits. The bandits could not hold out, and Commander Tao occupied Mashan. The bandits who had advanced to Qibao and Shanwan turned back and besieged Commander Tao, engaging in a fierce battle for several hours, even resorting to hand-to-hand combat. Commander Li Jue arrived from Changsha and made contact with Commander Tao, launching a joint attack. The bandits could not hold out, and on the 15th at Shenshi (3-5 PM), the entire line wavered and began to retreat. Pingxiang was turned from danger to safety, and the city siege was lifted. Because it was late that day, we stopped advancing. Now, our three detachments have all concentrated in Pingxiang, and we are scheduled to track down and pursue them in different directions before dawn today (the 16th). It is said that the Xiao bandits are now fleeing back to their old nest in Yongxin. As for the force that attacked Meitianqiao, they had only a slight contact at 1 PM on the 13th. Seeing that our reinforcements had arrived, they retreated to Dongqiao without any fierce battle. Another small force destroyed the railway and telegraph lines at Laotao on the 13th, but did not stay and also went to Dongqiao. All the damaged lines were restored on the 14th. According to the captured bandits, the Xiao and Cai bandits were ordered by the false central government to unite with the Kong bandits and He Chong to attack Pingli, so as to cut off the Western Route Army's communication with the national army in Jiangxi and seize the base of the Western Route</p>
<p>Army (the headquarters of the Western Route is located in Pingxiang) and destroy the defenses on the west bank of the Gan River. Fortunately, I was still in Changsha and Chief of Staff Liu Yinggushang remained in Pingxiang, so the mobilization of the troops was very fast, otherwise the damage would have been great," and so on. Finally, he also urged the people of various counties in Hunan Province to rush to repair bunkers and consolidate the rear to prevent the westward escape of the Gan bandits. After the speech, the crowd dispersed. Now that the people know that the bandits have fled, the market is very safe. He Jian originally planned to go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang that day to discuss something, but fearing that the people would be suspicious, he decided to sit in Changsha for the time being and not start his journey. Once the Xiao bandits and others are completely defeated, he will still make a trip to Jiangxi. (October 16th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Beiping states that Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops plotted to attack Northern Hebei for over a month. Some days ago, they sent personnel to Beiping to negotiate surrender. However, it is reported that yesterday (the 16th) at 4 PM, Fang Ji had already left the army and went to Tianjin, preparing to go abroad. His troops will be inspected by the authorities, and then dispersed and reorganized. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Fang Ji's actions this time were to unite with the troops of Tang Yulin, Liu Guitang, and Wang Ying. At the beginning of occupying Da and Xiao Tangshan, their momentum was extremely strong. Later, due to the strict blockade by Wan Fulin's troops and others, it was not easy to advance. In addition, supplies of provisions and ammunition could not be delivered, so a meeting was held. It was decided that Tang Yulin and Wang Ying's troops would return to Chahar, while Fang Ji would lead his troops east to retreat. They then arrived in the area of ​​East and West Dulin Village, where they were</p>
<p>Prevented by the Japanese army from advancing further. He had no choice but to send Wang Zhongfu and others to Beiping again the day before yesterday to negotiate surrender, requesting guarantees for his personal safety, cessation of oppression, and reorganization of his troops. The Beiping authorities stated that everything would be no problem, but Fang Ji and others must leave the army first. However, a response was required by 12 noon on the 15th. Wang and others immediately telegraphed Fang Ji. Fang Ji replied in a telegram that he could leave the army first, requesting the Beiping authorities to send a Eurasian Aviation plane to pick him up, or for Beiping's diplomatic and charitable organizations to send personnel to escort him to the front, or to allow him to bring a small number of guards to Shunyi to facilitate his disguise and departure. The Beiping authorities did not grant Fang Ji's request and again limited him to formally expressing his attitude by 10 a.m. yesterday (the 16th). At the same time, they additionally sent Guan Linzheng's troops to the Yang Yiying and Fengjiaying Kuliushu areas to prepare for an ambush. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., Xu Tingyao, Guan Linzheng, and others went to the front to deploy. At around 10 o'clock, Fang Ji again sent Mi Wenhe, the army commander of Fang's troops, Wang Changzhou, the chief of staff, and Hu Xi, the secretary-general, to Fengjiaying to meet with Li Xingcun, the division commander of Shang Zhen's troops, representing Fang Ji, expressing Fang Ji's decision to leave the army immediately, but requesting the following: (1) Guarantee the safety of Fang Ji's life after leaving the army; (2) Fang Ji's troops hope that the Beiping authorities will grant them reorganization; (3) The personnel and a part of the guards who followed Fang Ji hope to be properly arranged or given</p>
<p>Severance pay. They also said that before leaving the army, Fang Ji intended to meet with Commander Shang (Zhen), because Fang and Shang Zhen had a very deep friendship. Li replied that Commander Shang would arrive at the front soon, and all the details could be discussed with Shang in person and there would be no problem. Soon, Li sent Councilor Feng Heming and Staff Officer Jiang Xibin to accompany Mi Wenhe by car to meet Fang Ji. At around 11 a.m., Shang Zhen arrived at Fengjiaying and exchanged views with Xu Tingyao, Guan Linzheng, and others on Fang Ji's aftermath. At 2:30 p.m.,</p>
<p>Fang Ji and Mi Wenhe, etc., also arrived by car with a small number of guards. Shang Zhen went out to greet them and immediately discussed everything at the division headquarters of Li Xingcun. Fang Ji stated that he would leave the army that day to go abroad for investigation, but hoped that the Beiping authorities would properly handle his troops. Then Shang Xu used the telephone to ask He Yingqin for instructions. He granted all of Fang Ji's requests. Fang and others then had lunch at the division headquarters. After everything was settled, Fang immediately ordered his troops to await reorganization by Commander Shang and sent Mi Wenhe to be responsible for the ending. After receiving the order, Mi immediately returned to the defense area and gathered the troops in Dongzhuang, Luogezhuang, Qianhoushaluo, Matouzhuang, Donggezhuang, etc., to await inspection. At around 4 p.m., Fang Ji took the 32nd Army's car and went to Tianjin via Sunhe and Tongzhou. Shang sent a platoon of guards to escort him. Fang Ji arrived in Tianjin that night and stayed at Ji Hongchang's private residence in the French Concession. His actions were extremely secretive. However, according to a certain source, Mr. Fang had not yet arrived in Tianjin and had gone elsewhere midway. What exactly happened will be clear in the coming days.</p>
<p>After Fang Ji left, Shang Xu and others discussed Fang Ji's troops' aftermath and</p>
<p>Front-line deployment. At around 10 o'clock, Shang Xu returned to Beiping in the same car and went to Jurenhall to meet He to discuss the disposal of Fang Ji's troops and decided on several items: (1) Fang Ji's troops will be inspected first, and each soldier will</p>
<p>Be given five yuan and officers will be given yuan, and they will be dispersed and reorganized separately; (2) Guns and horses will be inspected and handed over separately; (3) After the inspection, they will be transferred to Baoding for training and reorganization empty-handed. The meeting dispersed at around 12 o'clock. He immediately issued a circular telegram reporting the resolution situation. The original text of the telegram said, "Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang rebelled and caused harm to the local area. This time, they repeatedly disturbed the vicinity of the Beiping suburbs. After being tightly blocked by the national army, their power was exhausted and they could not succeed. Today, they expressed their surrender to our front-line troops. Fang Ji and others have left the team and gone elsewhere. The remaining remnants are being disposed of. I would like to inform you that I have signed and sealed it, He Yingqin." As for Fang Ji and others, they also issued a circular telegram, stating their anti-Japanese experience and the difficulties of leaving the army this time, as well as their future intentions. The text is more than 500 characters long.</p>
<p>Today, the Military Branch has sent personnel to meet with Zhou Shangzhen's representative Li Jingrong to go to Fang Ji's defense area to inspect the troops. Fang Ji's troops originally had more than 14,000 people. After several battles and the bombing by Japanese aircraft this time, the number of remaining people is still unclear. Now the war in Northern Hebei is over, and the front-line troops will be demobilized immediately. The Japanese army also sent a staff officer to our army's defense area today, expressing that Fang Ji has left and the Japanese army will withdraw immediately. (October 17th)</p>

He then visited He Chengjun to discuss the aftermath of bandit suppression and made the following statement: "I was summoned to Gan this time, and because the provincial government's affairs were complicated, I asked Chairman Chiang to resign from the position of Acting Chief of Staff of the Headquarters. Chiang agreed that after Vice Minister Chen (Yi) returns from leave, Vice Minister Cao (Haosen) will be ordered to return to his post. During this period, it will still be difficult to resign. Regarding the provincial government</p>
<p>Reform issues, I previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang ordering the provincial government's expenses to be reduced by half to increase county government expenses. I also suggested to Chiang that the various departments of the provincial government should work together and simultaneously seek county government reforms. Chiang has telegraphed eight provincial governments to solicit opinions. I intend that the reform of the provincial system should be decided first, and the reform of the county government is especially necessary, because the provincial government is a design and supervisory agency, while the actual implementation is entirely in the hands of the county government. I have already drafted detailed suggestions for the reform of the county system and will publish them all soon. Wang and Chiang's meeting in Lushan discussed political reforms, but there was no meeting form. The eight-province food conference has been scheduled to be held in Gan. The provincial government intends to submit a proposal and hand it over to Director Jia (Shiyi) to attend. The food relief issue is the key to the rise and fall of the countryside, and it is also the life and death of the farmers. If we do not plan now, it will be too late. A month ago, I, along with Hunan Provincial Chairman He, Henan Provincial Chairman Liu, Anhui Provincial Chairman Liu, and Jiangxi Provincial Chairman Xiong, jointly telegraphed the central government to levy import tariffs on foreign rice to save the industry in crisis. The central government adopted it. Recently, I visited President Wang in Lushan, and he also paid great attention to this. It will be implemented in the shortest possible time. Now it is just a matter of procedure and must be passed by the Legislative Yuan. I also asked for instructions in Gan regarding the political facilities in the bandit area. The most important thing is to implement special education. The required expenses will be jointly raised by the headquarters and the provincial government. The headquarters will bear 40% and the provincial government will bear 60%. With funding, promotion will be easy. The construction of highways is also of great importance. It has now been decided to find a way to complete the seven-province highway plan. Those within the province's territory, in the southern Hubei area, will be jointly allocated considerable funds by the Nanchang Camp to subsidize construction. In the eastern Hubei area, the existing plan will still be followed to build it. In western Hubei, the original old road in Shihe will be widened and improved." (October 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Zhang Cui Zhenhua's Lawsuit: Yi Peiji Files a Counterclaim, Accusing Cui and Zheng of Conspiring to Sell Out the Appeal to Various Levels of Agencies <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>"For the matter of submitting a petition, I, Yi Peiji, have investigated the case of the Palace Museum by the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court Procuratorate, Zheng Lie, and the Prosecutor, Zhu Shusheng. Zheng Lie's telegram to Zhu Shusheng stated that 'Zhang instructed Yin to come immediately and prepare the fees first,' etc. Yin is the only witness for the public sale of fur goods. It is obvious that the accuser is bribing the witness to help others, committing a crime under Article 180 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, the Palace Museum clerks Dong Lin and Zhang Zhejilian reported that Yin Qiweng personally stated that Zhang Cui Zhenhua and the Chief Prosecutor Zheng Lie and Prosecutor Zhu Shusheng jointly colluded with the witness Yin Qiweng in all aspects, and the situation is even more obvious. Yi Peiji also found two telegrams from Zheng Lie to Zhu Shusheng at the Nanjing Wireless Telegraph Bureau. One said: 'It can be handled by the local procuratorate and the investigation of the superiors should be expedited... Xiaoyun Geng (Zheng's name is Xiaoyun),' and the other said: 'There is no resistance in this case, Li's criminal suspicion is serious and he should be arrested immediately... Xiaoyun Jia.' Zheng Lie, Zhu Shusheng, and others are derelict in their duties and incite false testimony and false accusations, and the evidence is conclusive. According to Article 180 of the Criminal Law, 'Anyone who intends to have another person receive criminal or disciplinary punishment by falsely accusing the competent civil servant shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than seven years. Anyone who intends to have another person receive criminal or disciplinary punishment and forges or alters evidence, or uses forged or altered evidence, shall be punished in the same way.' According to the above sections and the report that Li Zongdong personally wrote a note to purchase fur goods, etc., it has been found that it is indeed forged. Yin Qiweng Zhang Cui Zhenhua committed a crime under this article, and Zheng Lie Zhu Shusheng is the instigator of the second item of this article. Article 123 of the same law states, 'A civil servant who has the duty to prosecute crimes and commits one of the acts listed in each item shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years.' Also, the second item states, 'Anyone who knows that a person is innocent but causes him to be prosecuted and punished, or knowingly that a person is guilty but does not cause him to be prosecuted and punished without reason,' Article 139 of the same law states, 'A civil servant who entices a subordinate civil servant to commit a crime under Articles 228 and 139 shall have the original penalty for the crime of enticement reduced by one-half.' Article 140 of the same law states, 'A civil servant who takes advantage of his position or opportunity or method to intentionally commit crimes other than those in this chapter shall have the original penalty increased by one-third.' According to the above sections and Zheng Lie's telegram to Zhu Shusheng, 'It can be handled by the local procuratorate and the investigation of the superiors should be expedited,' etc., and the Jia telegram said, 'There is no resistance in this case, Li's criminal suspicion is serious and he should be arrested immediately.' Zheng Lie Zhu Shusheng has committed the crimes listed above in the Criminal Law. Zheng Lie, as the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, openly colluded with the accuser, ordering subordinates to buy witnesses and harm innocent people. Such a shocking thing is still rare. I now plan to file a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Jiangning Local Court, but Zheng and Zhu are both the heads of the procurators, and the Procuratorate of the Local Court may not be able to legally detain them. I hereby attach three copies of photos and documents, and petition your Department to promptly dismiss Zheng Lie and Zhu Shusheng and hand them over to the Jiangning Court for investigation and trial to show great fairness and uphold the law and discipline. It is for the public's convenience. I respectfully present this to the President of the Executive Yuan and the Minister of Judicial Administration, Yi Peiji." (End)</p>
<p>According to the above photo, one of the three documents, there are still two types of documents, which are reduced in size for printing, and I am omitting them because I am afraid they will be blurry.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Fujianese Oppose the Levy of Foreign Rice Tax – Because the Province's Rice Production is Insufficient <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou states that the provincial government has decided to abolish the tea export tax and levy a foreign rice import tax, which is now being actively implemented. The Finance Department has appointed Zhuang Taoru as the director of the Provincial Foreign Rice Import Tax Bureau and Wu Lutai as the director of the Southern Fujian Branch Bureau. The head office is located in Fuzhou, and the branch office is located in Xiamen, and they are ordered to open immediately. However, Xiamen rice merchants strongly oppose this. Yesterday, they specifically telegraphed the provincial government, requesting to suspend the implementation. The telegram stated that in a corner of Southern Fujian, except for Longxi and Haicheng</p>
<p>The two counties have slightly rice production, and the bulk of the supply depends on the ports of Yangon and Siam. At a time when bandit disasters are frequent and droughts are disastrous, spring plowing cannot be done and autumn harvest is hopeless. We rely entirely on foreign rice to help us. If heavy taxes are levied again, it will not only increase the burden on the people, but if foreign rice stops being transported, it will inevitably lead to famine. I beg the government to consider the situation and observe the difficulties of the people, and postpone the implementation to comply with public opinion, etc.</p>
<p>According to people in the rice industry in Fuzhou, the provincial capital needs to consume two thousand dan of rice every day, and one thousand dan are transported upstream. The source is two thousand dan transported from Shanghai and Hong Kong every day (of which Chinese rice and foreign rice each account for half), and one thousand dan are transported from the nearby Lianjiang and Changle counties. The price of rice in the market depends on the quantity of sources from Hong Kong and Shanghai and the high and low of the original price. Currently, top-quality rice is about eight yuan and eight jiao per dan, and inferior rice is worth about seven yuan per dan. However, in addition to the two thousand dan imported from Hong Kong and Shanghai, rice used to be transported to the province from upstream every year. This year, not only is there no rice transported to the province from upstream, but one thousand dan must be transported from the province every day. Between the coming and going, there is a difference of three thousand dan every day. With an average of eight yuan per dan, farmers upstream could earn 16,000 yuan a day in previous years. Now they have to spend 8,000 yuan, plus the constant trampling by red bandits over the years, how can the countryside not go bankrupt? Therefore, if the government does not have a fundamental plan to quell the disaster and revitalize the agricultural community, merely levying foreign rice tax is to make the impoverished farmers bear an additional burden of 1,000 yuan every day. But the provincial government has already appointed people to set up bureaus to handle it, so it will be difficult to stop the process. (October 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Shantou National Salvation Association: The Reason for Being Destroyed; Lin Songsheng's Integrated Factory for Selling Taiwanese Wine Was Suddenly Inspected <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou states that the Shantou National Salvation Association was destroyed by Taiwanese some days ago, as previously reported. The reason for this matter is that there is a person named Lin Songsheng from Chenghai who originally brewed wine with local rice in Tiangang Township, Chenghai. Tiangang is located near the Qiupu coast, where ships come and go, which is very convenient. It is more than ten miles by water from Shantou City and is under the jurisdiction of Xiapeng District, Chenghai. In recent years, Chaozhou local rice has become expensive, and the cost of brewing wine is too high. Lin's ingenious idea was to mix Dutch alcohol from the Netherlands with sugar water to become Shuanghua wine, which was sold on the market and made a lot of profit. Those who didn't know thought it was local wine. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese yen plummeted, and the alcohol produced in Taiwan was extremely cheap. Lin then partnered with a Taiwanese from Hongfa Foreign Firm on Chaoan Street, Shantou City, to run Taiwanese alcohol. The goods were disguised in the style of iron barrels from Dutch alcohol from Sambulong, Taiwan, and used old-fashioned motor fishing boats to go directly to the coast of the Fujian-Guangdong border, and then used small boats to smuggle them to Tiangang. The integrated winery run by Lin turned Taiwanese wine into counterfeit local wine and then sold it. The factory is a foreign-style house with a cellar underneath. The cellar can hold thousands of barrels of alcohol, each barrel holding 500 gallons. In order to prevent patriotic actions by the public, Lin specially placed two local cannons, fourteen rifles, several short guns, and more than ten fierce dogs to guard the factory site. All wine merchants know about these facts and hate them. Because Lin operates alcohol, the Shantou Aojia Cask Sales Office and the Xiapeng Wine Tax Bureau are all shareholders, helping the smooth growth of his business. Although the National Salvation Association has heard about it, it did not dare to arrest Lin due to too many concerns. On September 30, inspectors from the National Salvation Association went directly to Tiangang Township to search and found 1,105 barrels of Taiwanese alcohol, worth more than 100,000, and decided to transport all the alcohol to Shantou and detain Chen Xuwen and others. However, Lin Songsheng was not arrested. The National Salvation Association knew that the Japanese consulate would definitely interfere, so they checked the evidence that Lin was not of Japanese nationality and decisively charged Lin with the crime of being a traitor.</p>
<p>And offered a reward of 500 to arrest him, and decided to confiscate Lin's property. But Lin seemed to have nothing to fear and was still lying high in the Hongfa Foreign Firm, and told people that he had his own way. Before long, the Japanese consulate made a very strong protest to the municipal government, citing the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, claiming that Chen Xuwen was a worker of Japanese nationals and asking the municipal government to protect Japanese merchants' use of people and not to block the decks of Japanese ships (because boats and boats were not allowed to approach Japanese ships arriving in Shantou). The municipal government forwarded the original letter to the municipal party department of the National Salvation Association for reply. This was the fuse of this case.</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. on the 7th of this month, inspectors Yuan Qiang, Zhang Cheng, and Qiu Fu from the National Salvation Association seized a small boat in the river of the Huilan Bridge, loaded with eight packages of fish fins, and detained the owner of the goods, Chen Shaoyou, and two boatmen to the National Salvation Association for imprisonment. The fish fins were stored in the warehouse. After a while, a clerk from the Lianfa Store on Tongjin Street suddenly came to the association with two Japanese, demanding to hand over Chen Shaoyou and the fish fins. The duty member Ma Zonghan refused. The two Japanese left disappointed. At about 4 p.m., more than 20 armed Taiwanese suddenly swarmed into the National Salvation Association, carrying short guns and holding iron tools, destroying the equipment in the association, scolding and jumping. Then they pried open the warehouse, took out the fish fins, opened the prison door, and released seven people, including Chen Shaoyou, Huang Yashi, Lin Xing, Li Tiequan, Lin Yuchun, Lin Yazhong, and Chen Xuwen, and left swaggeringly. Afterwards, Mayor Zhai Zongxin, Social Section Chief Liang Shunan, and the secretary of the Japanese consulate all went to investigate. Zhai Liang and the National Salvation Association's executive Xu Dingguang went to the Japanese consulate to lodge a verbal protest. It is said that the Japanese consulate strongly denied that there was any instigation or connivance. This is the course of this case. It is rumored that the Japanese consuls in South China have recently decided at a meeting in a certain place to interfere with our people's patriotic movement, so this incident in Shantou may be its beginning, which is also unknown.

<p>A part of the depositors and creditors of the Songjiang Bank bankruptcy case sued the directors and supervisors, including Zhang Xiaomei, to the county court for compensation. The first instance judgment was that the creditors were not satisfied with the original judgment, and they still elected creditor representatives, such as Bai Guanlan, to appeal. The Suzhou Higher Court has now issued a summons, scheduling a hearing for November 6. The Songjiang Bank Liquidation Office has successively sued debtors in the county court. The amount of the judgment is the largest, for the director of the bank, Zhu Hesun's loan, which should be repaid at the rate of 12,800 yuan, interest of 4,317 yuan and eight jiao, and the agreed interest of 1% per month from the date of judgment to the date of repayment. If the above principal and interest are not repaid, Qiu Bincai shall repay 5,000 yuan, and Qiu Anrong shall repay 7,800 yuan. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant Zhu Hesun.</p>

<p>Wei Zhanyuan, concurrently the second and third district chief of the water police, considering that lake bandits have recently been appearing in Dianshan Lake and its nearby villages from time to time, which is a hidden worry for the countryside, ordered yesterday (the 18th) the 11th, 12th, 14th, and 15th water police teams stationed in Wujiang, Pingwang, Kunshan, and other places to dispatch patrol boats to encircle and suppress them.

<p>Various Industries Request Postponement of Registering Remaining Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The remaining Japanese goods sold by various shops in Suzhou were previously registered and sealed up by the Anti-Japanese Association. However, as time has passed, some may have privately opened the seals and sold them. Therefore, the Anti-Japanese Association again notified various industries to carry out a re-registration. Therefore, representatives of various industries gathered at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday (the 18th) and decided that the Chamber of Commerce should send a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association requesting a postponement of the registration.</p>

<p>Lu Junyi, the owner of the Fu Ji branch of the newspaper in Qingguoxiang, was selling fake lottery tickets. A young woman, Lu Huifen, purchased a Qingdao Universal Sports Association champagne ticket from the branch, which turned out to be a counterfeit. Because the lottery date was postponed, she sent a letter to the Qingdao office to inquire. The office then entrusted the Shanghai general manager of the Minhua Bank to send someone to Wuxi to report to the First Branch and bring Lu Junyi to court. Afterwards, his younger brother, Lu Junqing, went to Shanghai to lure the broker Shi Xingrong (i.e., Shi Arong) to Wuxi, where he was arrested and brought to justice, and detained together. After the Procuratorate concluded its investigation, it filed a public prosecution with the same-level criminal court in accordance with Article 226, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday, Judge Lai Sihug提签 brought the three defendants to court and announced the judgment: Lu Junyi, Lu Junqing, and Shi Xingrong, intending to use them for the purpose of exercising, collected forged and altered valuable securities, each sentenced to three years of imprisonment and a fine of five hundred yuan. After the sentence was pronounced, they were taken back into custody. However, Lu and others declared in court that they would not accept the judgment and would appeal to the High Court.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Comes to Wuxi to Discuss Building the Wuxi Highway</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing, Zhu Kaizhou, and other prominent businessmen from Shanghai and Wuxi previously initiated the construction of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and the opening of long-distance buses. However, due to the difficulty in raising capital, it was suspended. Last month, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng received a telegram from Chairman Jiang, ordering him to actively prepare for the project. A preparatory committee was then organized, with Wang Xiaolai elected as chairman and Wu Tiecheng, Rong Zongjing, Yang Hanxi, and others as committee members, to begin preparations. At 9:19 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 17th), Mr. Wang Xiaolai arrived in Wuxi from Nanjing on the express train and stayed at the Washington Hotel, where he met with local gentry Yang Hanxi, Qian Sunqing, Rong Desheng, and others to discuss the progress of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway and the fundraising methods.

<p>Li Dianzhen, in the third district of this county, was the victim of the Zhang Jingxuan family kidnapping case. Although the ransom has been paid, the bandit leader has not yet been captured. According to intelligence, the bandit leader Zhang Zhaoquan and his accomplices, Liu Si and others, are now hiding in Zhenjiang, using their service in a certain agency as a shield. The county specially dispatched Police Captain Zhu Daixin and detectives Gao Guisen and Jin Chao, together with public security personnel, to Zhenjiang with documents. At 9:00 a.m. on the 16th, they, together with the Zhenjiang detectives, arrested accomplices Xu Fengting and Liu Shifeng in the Chunjianglou. They confessed that they had two boats, moored under the Shifu Bridge. They were found upon investigation, along with three bandit women and four boys and girls. They were immediately transferred to the Fuyun Company's Shunfeng wheel and towed to Yangzhou. The bandits were detained at the Zhenjiang Detective Office awaiting transfer to Yangzhou. Zhang Zhaoquan (formerly known as Zhou Erzi) was also detected in the crowd and was transferred to Yangzhou on the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou train in the afternoon. The team leader Zhu Hui and detective Gao Guisen preliminarily interrogated him that night. It was reported that Zhang Zhaoquan had confessed to the kidnapping of Zhang and Jingxuan's two children and that a gun was stored at the home of a certain family in the Taizhou area. Xu, however, denied joining the bandits. The county government is currently being consulted for further investigation.</p>
<p>Large Quantity of Opium Seized</p>
<p>Gong Guoliang, the fifth district chief of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, received a report that a large quantity of opium was transported from Yichang and unloaded at Sanjiangkou, Zhouzhou, in recent days. He specially dispatched special squad leader Yin Xiu to lurk in the reeds on the Jialu patrol ship. On the morning of the 16th, around 4:00 a.m., they saw the Ewo's barge arriving at Sanjiangkou, throwing several paper bags into the river and sounding its steam whistle before leaving. Soon, two small boats came to retrieve them. Knowing that they were transporting opium, they immediately fired shots to stop them. The oil bags were seized, containing dozens of catties of opium, and seven opium peddlers were arrested, including three young men in Western suits. They were escorted to the district and reported to the People's Government for disposition. It was also learned that the 23rd Detachment of the Xianwater Public Security Bureau also seized 15 sacks of opium, each weighing more than ten catties, in the Lantouba area on the same day. It was reported that the well-known opium peddler Jiang Songyan from Jiangbei transported them from Hankou to the border area between Jiangsu and Anhui by steamer and then repackaged them for transport by sailing boat. The team has now detained the boat and confiscated the opium, but it is not known whether it will be transferred to the district for disposal.</p>
<p>The Finale of the Silk Fabric Industry Dispute</p>
<p>The dispute between the six industries in Yangzhou and Dasheng has been resolved through arbitration. However, the silk fabric shop clerks yesterday (the 16th) sought help from the thirty-one industries, including Chaidian, and sent a public letter to Dasheng advising them to make concessions. It is now learned that Dasheng has replied to the various industries, generally stating that they will strictly abide by the arbitration method. If the silk fabric shop clerks disagree, they can make suggestions to the county government. The labor and management of the fabric industry held an emergency meeting at the guild hall at 32 early on the 17th, and decided to resume business, resume work, and welcome Dasheng to join the association. However, four stores, including Daxing, opened their doors but did not unload their goods, and four stores, including Chuhongda, have not yet opened their doors. There is still a white slip at the door stating "Strictly abide by the county government's mediation, and temporarily suspend the petition for another day to promote the attention of all sectors," signed "A Public Announcement by the Silk Fabric Shop Clerks." It is also learned that Fuyu Xiang and other fabric businesses have resumed normal operations. Dasheng opened on the morning of the 16th.</p>

<p>Wang, the daughter-in-law of Zou Changfu, a farmer in Qiaoshu Town in the seventh district of the county, is 29 years old. Since last autumn, her abdomen has been as big as a drum, and she thought it was bloating. Fortunately, her diet has remained constant and she has been living well, so she didn't care. Suddenly, around 1:00 p.m. on the 16th, she had labor pains and gave birth to a child with three heads and one body, with complete facial features. The whole town was shocked for a while, and the threshold of visitors was worn through. The family members regarded it as ominous and did not add swaddling clothes. It died after a while.</p>

<p>Qianjing Pond, near Fanjing Town in this county, is a place where bandits and salt smugglers often appear. Bandits often leave torn ransom notes here. Yesterday, a male corpse floated in Dagangzhong in that area. He was wearing a blue silk satin lined robe. His shoes and socks were gone. The bullet marks on his head were clear. The situation was very tragic. The local village police reported it to the bureau for examination and investigation of the real murderer. According to the locals, two days ago, they saw three pirate ships sailing east here. This corpse is feared to be a torn ticket.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases in the County</p>
<p>The Xi family, a wealthy family in Zhanghui Town's East Township, had a slightly rich dowry due to their son's marriage, which was coveted by bandits. Last night, they formed a gang and went to rob them. There were six or seven bandits in total, carrying Mauser guns and box cannons. They ransacked the boxes and chests and looted as they pleased. The local defense group was informed and set off to pursue them, but the bandits had already left. At the same time, three bandits, speaking the Huaiyang dialect, also arrived at the Xu family, a farmer in Randianbang outside the East Gate. Each held a sharp weapon and robbed all the rooms in the house. Before leaving, they set fire to the straw stacks on the field. Fortunately, it did not spread. The bandits are like hair, and the rural areas around Jiashan are afraid that there is no pure land.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Hangzhou: The Jianggan Telephone Riot Expands <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>In the Jianggan District of Hangzhou, 131 households with South-character telephones were required by the Provincial Telephone Bureau to pay a machine deposit of 40 yuan per household by a deadline, otherwise their phones would be shut off and the machines removed. The users sent a letter to the bureau to question them, and a dispute arose. The telephone bureau began shutting off the phones of these households in order from the 17th. If they did not pay within ten days, all the machines would be removed. The situation is expanding. The users immediately elected representatives to form a committee to jointly deal with the situation and asked the chairman of the city's chamber of commerce, Wang Zhuzhai, and the manager of the Bank of China, Jin Runquan, to uphold justice. Mr. Wang immediately met with the director of the telephone bureau, Zhao Zengjue, at the Bank of China yesterday (the 18th) afternoon to discuss a solution. Zhao said that the machine deposit must be paid in accordance with the regulations, but the time could be considered. Installing automatic telephones is not possible due to economic reasons. The users, on the other hand, demanded that automatic telephones be installed, the same as in Gongbei and other places, and the machine deposit would be paid. Both sides' attitudes were quite firm, and a solution could not be reached immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e92">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Implementation of Taxes on Japanese Rice Transported to Shanghai for Dumping <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, stating that Japan recently had more than one million stones of stale rice, which are being dumped like a lotus. It is said that 25,000 stones will arrive in Shanghai soon. The association specially telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, requesting the implementation of taxes to save the declining countryside. The telegram is recorded as follows: To the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, we have learned that Japan's stale rice is accumulated and the rice price is low, which has been reported many times. The situation is almost the same as in our country. Moreover, this year's new grain harvest in that country is said to be five to six million stones more than in previous years. It is really in the intention of using stale rice to dump in our country. Now the new grain in various provinces will be released soon. If foreign rice surges in, the price of new rice will be reduced. The tragedy of rural famine will be even worse than last year. Foreign rice tax has been rumored for a long time. It is heard that the Legislative Yuan has decided the tax rate. At this critical moment, the implementation should not be delayed. We request you to firmly preside over the matter and implement it as soon as possible. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bowed.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Federation of Chambers of Commerce Cables the Government Requesting a Swift Draft of Foreign Rice Tax Rate <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce cabled the Chen Government again yesterday, saying: To the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the Nanjing National Government, the imposition of a heavy import tax on foreign rice and the abolition of illegal donations on domestic rice to cure the rural economy, the above has been submitted to the Government for review. Later, Guangdong held a different opinion, and the association telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government, requesting a unanimous position. After that, Guangdong first implemented it, and Fujian followed suit. Since the two provinces have implemented the import tax on foreign rice, the needs of the two provinces of Guangdong and Fujian have caused the price to rise due to the lack of rice, and the savings of Hunan and Anhui provinces have seen activity and improvement. Although the time is not long, the effect has been significant. If our government can quickly implement it nationwide, its effectiveness will be even more remarkable. Then, after this autumn's harvest, farmers will be able to sell their surpluses. Although they cannot reach Suzhou immediately, they can get a little breather. Now, although our government's foreign rice tax principle has been passed by legislation, the rate of foreign rice tax is still to be drafted in detail by the Ministry of Finance. Generally, foreign rice merchants will take this opportunity to determine the tax rate and have not yet implemented the opportunity to fully transport and hoard to wait for selling. Then, when the new rice is on the market, it will inevitably be crowded out by foreign rice, and the decline in rice prices will be even more unimaginable. It is reasonable to cable the Chen Government again for review and earnestly request that the import tax rate on foreign rice be quickly drafted and implemented immediately. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce bowed.</p>

Worries About the Sales of Japanese Yarn at Reduced Prices <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Association, all parties believe that the government has gradually implemented relief measures for Chinese yarn and know that the association will have new plans to implement for the cure of the symptoms and root causes of domestic cotton yarn. Therefore, the yarn and cloth trading market has become active in Chinese yarn. Many parties have absorbed a lot and various yarn prices have been up from yesterday by one yuan six jiao to four jiao. Yesterday morning, it was still very firm and slightly rising. The price of Japanese yarn has fallen drastically for days. According to the yarn industry, the price increase of Chinese yarn may be due to temporary impulses, which may not last. The price of Japanese yarn has fallen, and merchants may cause the disadvantage of Japanese yarn sales for the sake of cheapness.</p>

<p>Former Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the League of Nations Council, Japanese Sugimura Yotaro, and the current Japanese Minister to Canada, Tokugawa Iesato, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday via Pingjinqing from the Northeast Road. Yesterday, it was reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government would hold a banquet to entertain them. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency went to the Municipal Government yesterday morning to inquire about the matter. According to Commissioner Wang Changchun, the news was a misrepresentation. Because I have been friends with Sugimura for a long time, and this time, etc. are passing through Shanghai, I should host a banquet from the standpoint of friendship to fulfill the friendship of the host. Outsiders misinterpreted it as the Municipal Government's reception. Sugimura and Tokugawa do not want to stay in Shanghai for a long time. They have decided to take the night express to Beijing at 11 o'clock tonight to visit various authorities of the National Government. They will stay in Beijing for one or two days and then go to Hankou. According to another rumor, although Sugimura expressed that this visit to China is entirely for travel purposes, it is said that his mission is to explore all the progress of our technical cooperation with the League of Nations.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recovered the telephone rights beyond the concession, it dismantled the telephone sets in the concession and replaced them with the bureau's telephones. At the same time, it expanded its equipment. The drawing of the branch in the city center has also been drawn and submitted to the ministry. The installation of the Pudong underwater line will be completed soon, and it will be possible to make calls next month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The new building of the Municipal Government in the city center of the city has been officially moved into for office in the New Year's Day next year. The telephones in the district have now been installed by the bureau. For the convenience of management, a base on Sanmin Road has been purchased to build a telephone branch.

<p>Since the bureau canceled the five-cent call fee in the Chinese concession, the number of Chinese users making calls to the concession has greatly increased, averaging 12,000 times per day (previously only 4,000 times). Therefore, it feels that the machine parts are insufficient and cannot cope with the demand. The bureau has ordered machines from the United States to expand its equipment so that users will not have to wait for a long time without sound. It is said that the machine will be shipped to Shanghai at the end of the year, but at present, it can only be reluctantly dealt with.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Chinese People's Drug Elimination Society Telephones to Strictly Arrest Drugs, Especially Gengen Morphine and Red Pills, Which Are More Poisonous Than Opium, Requesting the Authorities to Strictly Prohibit Them <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese People's Drug Elimination Society at 207 Mendelane Road, Shanghai, telegraphed the chairman of the Kuomintang, Lin Sen, the president of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, and the chairman of the Nanchang Military Commission, Jiang Jieshi, saying that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners gather, and it is also a hub for trafficking in drugs. Recently, all drugs such as Gengen morphine and red pills are also Shanghai's manufacturing and transportation center, and are transported by train to various places, followed by ships. The transportation method is quite mysterious. If you are not familiar with the inside story, it is not easy to find out. In Shanghai, there have been repeated seizures of large-scale manufacturing plants, and there are many newspaper records. However, no seizures have been made at stations and ports in the mainland. The reason is that the packaging of the drug is secret, and the carriers are cooperating with each other. Therefore, the traffickers of red pills feel more confident, and their flow is more practical than opium. Lin Zexu said that if this disaster is not eliminated, there will be no soldiers or salaries available in ten years. I am afraid that there will be no available people in the Republic of China in ten years. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. The members of our association have seen this and are deeply worried about the tragedy of the country's destruction and the extinction of the species. Therefore, this association was established to urge the government on the one hand and assist the authorities on the other hand, hoping to eliminate drugs and eliminate drug disasters, and to save the people from fire and water. This is what the members of our association pray for day and night. We have always admired your concern for the people's suffering and your hatred of evil. We dare to submit this to you for your review and approval to reiterate the ban, and to inform all places to transfer military and police agencies to secretly assist in the arrest, and especially pay attention to the Shanghai station. Our association is closer to the source and will report the handling at any time, so that the source can be eradicated and there will be a day when drugs can be eliminated. We also pray that you will comply with this order. The standing committee members of the Chinese People's Drug Elimination Society, Huang Jiemin, Qian Xuecheng, etc., bowed.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Transportation of Luggage and Parcels Fees <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways instructed the Railway Bureau that the cargo crossing fees for the capital ferry and passenger fares had already been notified in the micro-telegram and the Lianzi No. 6724 order of this month, respectively, and should be followed. All cargo and passengers passing through the ferry should follow these regulations. The Ministry now stipulates the crossing fees for luggage and parcels transported by the capital ferry: 5 cents for every 20 kilograms of luggage (less than 20 kilograms will also be calculated as 20 kilograms), with a minimum charge of 10 cents; 3 li per kilogram for parcels, with a minimum charge of 10 cents. Once the fees for cargo, luggage, parcels, and passenger fares crossing the river have been set, no other donations or fees may be added, nor may they be reduced due to various discounted tickets. Those not crossing the river by ferry will still be handled according to the current methods. In addition, all through Shanghai-Ping passenger tickets and all tickets supplemented on the through Shanghai-Ping trains on the Beining, Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhangyong railways should be printed with the four red characters "滬平通車" (Through Shanghai-Ping Train) to make them clear. A red horizontal line should be added above the four characters "滬平通車" to indicate that it includes the special express train surcharge. The procedures for supplementary tickets should be simplified. If tickets are supplemented en route, all fees from each railway and all supplementary fees should be collected at once to avoid each railway collecting fees separately and to save procedures. The crossing fees for all goods not graded and calculated by piece or item in the grading table will be notified separately after they have been successively determined. The above sections should be followed accordingly. The bureau has already instructed the Transportation Department to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Stalled Inspection of Factories in Concessions Impedes the Implementation of Labor Policies in the City <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, although the Municipal Government has repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Municipal Council on the inspection of factories in the concessions, the issue has reached a stalemate due to the Council's stubborn adherence to its views and its failure to show any concessions. It was recently reported that the Municipal Government would seek a new way to resolve the case. According to Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, this matter is now at a standstill, and the Municipal Government has no intention of seeking another solution. According to Tian Heqing, director of the Factory Inspection Division of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, although the first step of factory inspection in the Chinese area has been completed, the second step cannot be carried out because the inspection of factories in the concessions cannot be implemented. Therefore, the issue of inspecting factories in the concessions must be resolved as soon as possible so as not to hinder the implementation of the city's entire labor policy.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Hainan Sugar Merchant Representatives Plead for Assistance from Various Chambers of Commerce Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Xing Juefei, representative of the Qiongya sugar merchants of Guangdong and representative of the Haikou Chamber of Commerce, went to Beijing to petition about the Jianghai Customs' penalty on local sugar from Qiongya. Yesterday morning, Xing went to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to request assistance. Xu Esheng, secretary of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, received him, discussed the details of the situation and all the conclusive evidence, and stated that the chamber was paying close attention to the case, had previously telegraphed the Customs Administration three times to strongly argue the case, and would be willing to assist in handling it in the future. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, also received him and stated that this matter was related to the life and death of the South China sugar industry and promised to do his best to assist. The Guangdong Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at the request of Representative Xing, and the representative attended to report. It is reported that the representative will go to Beijing tonight. The details of the case stated by the representative are recorded as follows to clarify the truth of the case. In April of this year, seven businesses, including Liansheng in Haikou City, Qiongya, were penalized more than 6,000 yuan by the Qionghai Customs Commissioner for exporting local sugar, which was falsely represented as foreign sugar. The merchants were not convinced and transported the sugar to Shanghai to present it to the Jianghai Customs for re-verification. The result was that it was recognized as local sugar. Those who presented it to the Changsha Customs for re-verification were also issued verification documents. In May, the Qiong Guangdong and two other ships transported sugar from Haikou for export, and the Qiong Customs considered that it was mixed with foreign sugar, while the Jiang Customs considered it pure local sugar. In July, the Yongcheng and two other companies transported local sugar for export, and the Qionghai Customs Commissioner again pointed out that it was mixed with foreign sugar. The sugar merchants protested, and the commissioner could not show the difference between the local and foreign sugars. Later, the Haikou Chamber of Commerce mediated, and the commissioner allowed the sugar to be transported to Shanghai for re-verification. The commissioner did not quietly wait for the verification results, but secretly telegraphed the Jianghai Customs to indicate that the sugar was mixed with foreign sugar and requested that it be detained. The Jiang Customs did not investigate and approved the request. The sugar merchants felt wronged and repeatedly requested thorough investigation, but they were ignored. In the same month, two businesses, Housheng and others, transported local sugar to Shanghai, and both were repeatedly verified by the Qionghai Customs at the time of import and export, recognized as local sugar, completed tax payment according to regulations, and were released. When the goods arrived in Shanghai, they were detained by the Jiang Customs. The bad news came, and the sugar merchants in Shanghai were greatly shocked because the Qiong and Jiang Customs contradicted each other repeatedly, causing the merchants to suffer injustices and not know what to do. They had to decide to stop transporting to avoid losses and jointly asked more than 100,000 farmers who lived by producing sugar to ask the Qiongya authorities to maintain it. In this case, the Qiongya Pacification Commissioner Chen Zhangfu, Qionghai Customs Supervisor Zhan Jusi, Qiongya Industry Bureau Chief Zhu Yini, Qiongshan County Chief Chen Mengsun, and others all believed that the local sugar was hit by this blow, which was indeed a major economic crisis in Qiongya. They responded to the appeals of the city chamber of commerce and farmers and each sent representatives to a meeting to discuss ways to maintain local sugar to avoid the plight of farmers and merchants. Immediately after the resolution, representatives from the above-mentioned agencies were sent to form a local sugar field investigation team to personally inspect the sugar-producing areas in September in order to present to the central financial and economic departments to distinguish between the local and foreign sugars, and to effectively protect the Qiongya sugar industry. As a result, local sugar from Shizi Road Longchang and other places in Qiongshan County was brought back and publicly inspected in the city chamber of commerce. It was found that the local sugar in this area was the same as the local sugar previously detained in Shanghai. The Haikou City Chamber of Commerce and the sugar merchants then sent Xing Juefei as a representative to carry various physical evidences and written statements to Beijing to appeal to the central government to thoroughly investigate and redress the grievances suffered by the sugar merchants many times, and to effectively protect the safety of the export of local sugar in the area, so as to relieve the people's difficulties and revitalize the industry.</p>
<h3 id="e108">China Merchants Bureau Has Not Proceeded with Loan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Communications has approved the National China Merchants Bureau's plan to borrow 15 million yuan from the banking sector in the city. However, according to Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the bureau, the board of supervisors of the bureau has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications for funds to be allocated to the bureau due to the lack of capital for business development. As for the Ministry of Communications' approval of the loan from the Shanghai banking sector, this has not happened. The bureau and its personnel have not yet contacted the banking sector regarding this loan. In addition, the China Merchants Bureau currently owes HSBC 11 million yuan. If the collateral of HSBC Bank is used as collateral, after deducting the amount owed, how much is left? In addition, when the shares were repurchased, a temporary loan of about 3-4 million yuan was borrowed from the banking sector, so the 15 million yuan loan can only be used to repay the debts of the two places.

<h3 id="e109">Shanghai General Labor Union Issues Declaration, Sends Letter to Municipal Council, and Hosts Press Conference to Resolve the Electricity Strike <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The strike by workers at the Shanghai Public Concession Electricity Company has now lasted more than 20 days. Although various parties have mediated, there has been no effect so far. If the company does not resolve this matter soon, the strike will expand, and the society will be affected. The Shanghai General Labor Union issued a declaration yesterday as a final appeal, sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council, and asked them to uphold justice and seek a swift resolution. It also hosted reporters from various newspapers at 3:00 p.m. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration Issued Since the outbreak of the strike at the Public Concession Electricity Company, this union has deeply understood the importance of the public electricity business to society. On the one hand, it has persuaded workers to maintain the current so that the interests of social users are not affected. On the other hand, it has announced the details to all parties to seek a fair judgment. The report issued on the 9th of this month is even more detailed. This union's painstaking efforts to value public welfare should be understood by all parties. Now, the company insists on its preconceived ideas and does not make the slightest concession. Recently, it has hired a large number of White Russians to replace Chinese workers, making the workers who were forced to strike even more angry. Its lack of sincerity in reconciliation is obvious. We deeply regret this kind of action by the company. This union has examined the general situation and is deeply afraid that if it continues to insist, the workers will be forced by the needs of life, and when this union's advice loses its authority, a radical change will be inevitable, and all sectors of industry and commerce will suffer. Therefore, this union tirelessly tells our people from all walks of life that the cause of this strike seems to be the dismissal of three workers, but the crux of the problem is far beyond the company's continuous dismissal of workers over the years and the pension that the workers should have received. At first, the workers still hoped that the company would realize its mistakes, and only used patience and requests. When patience and requests were not enough to move the company's heart, the public was angered and the serious situation of today was formed. Since the electricity business is related to public welfare and social security, we seem unable to let it develop naturally until even more unfortunate events occur. In short, this union feels that it has exhausted its efforts and voices in dealing with this dispute. I hope that people from all walks of life, for the sake of the interests of users and the suffering of Chinese workers, will make a serious and powerful expression from the standpoint of supervising public utilities, so that the company authorities who adhere to preconceived ideas will know what to do. Society is fortunate, workers are fortunate. This declaration is made with respect.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council To the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council Board of Directors: Sirs, since the outbreak of the strike at the Shanghai Electricity Company, this union has been deeply afraid that this will lead to unfortunate events that may harm the public interest. In order to avoid the expansion of the situation, it has done its best to seek guidance or run around to find a way to mediate. Although representatives of the party and government, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, and Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng and Xu Xinliu expressed their opinions to the company, they were rejected by the company authorities' preconceived and firm attitude. Even Mr. Zhong Si, the director of your bureau, offered his good intentions to mediate after the workers petitioned, but he did not receive the attention of the company authorities. The workers had no choice but to give a warning of a slowdown, and then the company's refusal to work led to the fact of a strike. However, the workers were fortunate to follow the advice of this union and continue to maintain the power generation work, which has not yet harmed the public interest. However, this kind of advice, whether its effectiveness can last, this union cannot estimate. Therefore, there are also meetings of social leaders to jointly maintain security and stability, and the publication of reports on resolving disputes, with the intention of obtaining a reasonable solution before the effect of the advice is exhausted. But waiting until today, the company, in addition to publishing an open letter that intends to insult and is not factual, has not shown any sincerity. There is no doubt that it is intentionally undermining the effectiveness of this union's advice and engaging in the manufacture of unfortunate events. Therefore, your council, in terms of its responsibility to manage municipal affairs and maintain security, cannot but pay attention to it. Therefore, this union has enclosed a copy of the report to all parties, a copy of the draft of the workers' rebuttal to the open letter, and asks your council to carefully review them and determine who is right and wrong. This union has already done its best to persuade the workers to make concessions on the conditions they demand, and has returned the judgment of whether the conditions for concessions are reasonable to the gentlemen who were previously enthusiastic about mediation. It is confident that it has done its best to respect justice and protect the public welfare of society. If this kind of fair and reasonable expression cannot make the company realize its mistakes, then the company's disregard for justice, disregard for municipal affairs, and disregard for the public welfare of helping it to benefit all users is also obvious. The company's current authorities, judging from their psychological views, are not suitable talents for operating a monopolized public utility. This council should immediately correct or advise its board of directors and the American headquarters to remove them for the sake of managing municipal affairs and maintaining public welfare and security. Otherwise, its past contempt for Mr. Zhong Si's psychology will inevitably advance to contempt for your council. Not only will your council's plans for citywide electricity and public welfare policies be obstructed, but it is feared that under its views of only knowing how to seek profit and oppression, an unfortunate event will be triggered, which is also likely to happen. If this kind of event becomes a reality, then from the point of view of municipal achievements, it will be a shame to record. This union knows that the efforts of advising striking workers are definitely not enough to resist the pressure of their livelihood needs. When this union's advice is exhausted, it will be the day when an incident occurs. Taking advantage of the fact that the strength has not yet been exhausted, this special request is made to your council, wishing your council to use its possible power to assist this union in preventing incidents, respecting justice, and the success of advocating the public welfare of society. Words cannot express everything. We respectfully await your reply.</p>
<p>Hosting Reporters The General Labor Union hosted reporters from various newspapers at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and Zhu Xuefan reported on the progress of the strike, saying, in short, that the Public Concession Electricity Company has been on strike for more than 20 days. On the workers' side, because the electricity business is of great importance to social security, workers continue to work in the power generation section. On the company's side, although various parties have mediated, it has never accepted sincerity. Although the workers are now suffering all kinds of pain, they strictly abide by the order and unite as one. Their painstaking efforts to maintain security can be shared by people in the society. Today, Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, and Du Yuesheng are willing to take responsibility for mediation and consult with the Municipal Council to resolve the matter. On the workers' side, there are no preconceived ideas, and there are no so-called conditions. They only seek the upholding of justice and can resume work immediately. If this matter is not resolved quickly, so that the workers are forced to be unable to maintain, then once the power generation section is also declared to stop working, there will be a feeling of unease in the society, and the impact on factories will be even more serious. Since the January 28 Incident, the various Chinese factories in the city have been in a slump. If the power generation section stops working, the factories will be hit even harder and will be unbearable. Therefore, the workers initially did not want to take this last resort. However, the company is still not aware of its mistakes and still has the mentality that it is a foreign business and that Chinese people should not object to any measures, which has led to the occurrence of unfortunate events. All responsibility should be borne by the company.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Fisheries Merchants Association Telephones to Request Exemption from Pond Construction Fee Lists Ten Reasons for Requesting Exemption <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>In order to improve the entire Chinese fishery plan, the Ministry of Industry has established the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Committee and established the Fishery Collection and Construction Fee Office to work separately. Fishermen and merchants, unable to bear the burden, have successively presented petitions to the Ministry of Industry requesting exemption. After various mediations, the issue has been resolved. Now, the pond fresh fish merchants, on the grounds that the collection office uniformly collects 1% of river fresh and pond fresh, have aroused the opposition of the pond fresh fish merchants, and they have successively sent people to appeal to the authorities. Recently, the Shanghai Fisheries Merchants Association has presented a letter to the Ministry of Industry requesting an explanation of the difference between pond fresh and river fresh, requesting exemption, which is recorded as follows: Presentation regarding the request for exemption from the fishery construction fee for pond fresh fish. Since recent years, the economy of Chinese fishing villages has been extremely bankrupt, and the only thing that can survive is the absence of taxes and levies. Now, Your Excellency, in order to realize the entire fishery plan, has taken the initiative to collect fishery construction fees, revitalize the fishing village economy, and resist the intrusion of enemy fish. The good laws and good intentions are included in them, and our entire body of fishermen and merchants should sincerely support them. However, the uniform collection of river fresh and pond fresh is because Your Excellency has not understood the truth of the matter. We respectfully present it to Your Excellency. The fish harvested from Taihu Lake and the ocean are purely natural products, and fishermen do not need to raise them on weekdays. Pond fresh fish is not the same. They must be subject to field tax and surcharges. If pond fish is also levied, the indirect taxes and levies paid would be several times over. This is the first reason to request exemption. The fish body is collected from the Yangtze River area. Along the way, it is lost to extortion by military police and hooligans. Protectors cannot reach it in time, the cost is already heavy, and hope is difficult to expect. This is the second reason to request exemption. The fishing village economy has gone bankrupt, which is an undeniable fact. The funds for purchasing fish bodies are borrowed from banks, and after being exploited by heavy profits, they are also restricted by banks. Pond fish must be sold through banks, and each hundred yuan must pay bank commission of seven yuan. The number of one hundred yuan has lost fourteen yuan. Adding the profit to it, it is lucky that the cost is not eroded. This is the third reason to request exemption. The fish body enters the pond, and it takes three years of hard work to supply the market. There are field taxes, labor, and feed. Now, if the fish feed, such as snails, etc., must also pay construction fees, the cost of one fish is already insufficient. This is the fourth reason to request exemption. The grain fish raised and grown up is transported from the place of origin to the Shanghai market. Along the way, the military police and hooligans are again called "fish food" and forcibly demand a loss of 20%. Those in power may not have heard of it, but the fishermen and merchants suffer unspeakable pain. This is the fifth reason to request exemption. Each time a boat is berthed in Shanghai, it must pay a wharf fee of two yuan, which is deducted by the banks. If the weights and measures are eaten, the tails are owed, and the accumulation is small and the burden is heavy. This is the sixth reason to request exemption. What's more, in recent years, the rural areas have gone bankrupt, and vagrants are like crucian carp. There are thefts of fish and robberies of fish everywhere. The government has no special personnel to protect them, and fishermen are in great difficulty due to economic difficulties. The loss is huge. As for otters, frogs, kites, etc., the losses are also serious. It takes a lot of effort to get a fish to the market. This is the seventh reason to request exemption. What cannot be stopped from saying is that if there is a drought, the pond fish will not be left alive. If there is a flood, they will go with the waves. Not to mention fish plague and fish disease. This is the eighth reason to request exemption. What's more, the social economy has been fundamentally shaken, and red bandits are everywhere. Everywhere, they use the opportunity. If the fishermen have no way to make a living, how can they not take risks? If donations are doubled, their way to survival will be cut off. The hidden worries in the future are very anxious. This is the ninth reason to request exemption. The rural economy has gone bankrupt, and the government has begun to remedy it. The suffering of the fishermen should be measured by example. There is no time to save them. How can they be levied again? This is the tenth reason to request exemption. The above suffering is not dared to be silent. It is with the view of gathering firewood and the meaning of saints choosing them, and urgently speaking, hoping to examine the truth, condescendingly grant the request, and it is convenient for the public.</p>

<p>After the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, silver furnace businesses and public assaying bureaus were ordered to cease operations. Regarding silver furnaces installed in various silver shops,</p>
<p>the Ministry of Finance instructed the Silver Furnace Guild to notify them to dismantle all of them. The Central Mint is establishing a refinery to accommodate unemployed workers. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Ministry of Finance Instructions <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In addition to instructing the Money Guild to notify the silver furnace businesses and public assaying bureaus to cease operations, the Ministry of Finance also issued Instruction No. 9844, Qianzi, to the Shanghai Silver Furnace Guild, stating: It has been previously ordered that all silver furnaces in Shanghai must cease operations, dismantle the furnaces, and not privately open furnaces for melting and casting. Those silver shops in Shanghai that have silver furnace equipment must also dismantle all of them and not privately melt and cast silver for sale. This order is hereby issued for the guild to notify and ensure compliance. In the future, if any private furnace opening and melting is discovered, report the names immediately to the Ministry for investigation and handling. This order is issued.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Various Silver Shops Comply <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the instructions from the Ministry of Finance, the Silver Furnace Guild forwarded them to the Shanghai Municipal Silver Shop Trade Association and the Shanghai Municipal New Silver Shop Trade Association for compliance. As for the approximately fifteen members of the Silver Shop Guild, namely the large silver shops, and the approximately sixteen members of the New Silver Shop Guild, namely the new silver shops, they have all been ordered to stop melting silver ingots. However, the approximately one thousand small shops, which have no organizational structure, usually also melted silver ingots in their business. Since the public assaying bureaus stopped assaying, although the silver furnaces have not been physically dismantled, they have also stopped melting silver ingots.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Recruiting the Unemployed <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance to assess and recruit unemployed workers from the silver furnace businesses and public assaying bureaus, such as those engaged in melting, testing, and assaying, the Central Mint, due to the need to hire more coinage workers, has already recruited seven unemployed workers from the Tongchu and Tongsheng silver furnace businesses. Furthermore, in view of the lack of equipment for refining silver to standard purity, the decision has now been made to establish a refinery. Preparations are underway, and unemployed workers from the silver furnace businesses and public assaying bureaus will be notified to go to the mint for performance assessment, so that they can be recruited as workers when the refinery begins operations.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Tragic Situation of Banditry in Taihe County: The County Has Been Ravaged Five Times <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Taihe County in Anhui Province has suffered severely from banditry. The Red Swastika Society has sent personnel to provide relief. However, the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large. It is not enough to raise funds extensively to save the dying people. Yesterday, the county sent representatives Gao Ji-zhi and Xu Ming-ya, with letters and photos of the disaster area, to the Red Swastika Society, requesting continued relief. The words were tragic. The original letter is excerpted below: Respected Sirs, Taihe is a poor and barren land. It has always been without reserves. In addition, there have been two years of poor harvests, and nine out of ten households are empty. Fortunately, there was timely rain and sunshine, and there was hope for the autumn harvest. Unexpectedly, on August 13, more than 10,000 bandits from Cheng, Yang, Jiang, and Ma suddenly occupied the old county seat of Jiuxianji in this county from Wenji and Huaji in Fuyang. They occupied it for ten days, and every day they went out to burn, kill, rob, and plunder, to the west to Shuizipu, Jieshouji, Chenmiaoji, and Mengji, to the south to Zhuanqiaoji, to the east to Yuanqiangji and Anfengji, and to the north to Gaomiaoji, Shuangfu, and Black Tiger Temple. On the 24th, they passed through Caimiao and Dahuangmiao to the vicinity of Guangwumiao and Lixingji, and occupied it for three days. This is the first time they passed through and ravaged the area. On August 28, they passed through Guangwumiao and Lixingji, and then Shuangmiao, Zhangcedian, Banqiaoji, and Zitaiji towns, and then sneaked into the two counties of Wo and Meng. This is the second time they passed through and ravaged the area. On September 2, they sneaked back from Wo and Meng, passing through Feihekou, Pugouji, Hongshanmiao, Qingniquan, Cishengji, Qiuquji, Shicao, and the two counties, and then sneaked into the Meiludian area in Henan Province. This is the third time they passed through and ravaged the area. On September 7, they sneaked back from Henan to Guangwumiao, passing through Hujiji, Ganggouji, Niqiuji, Quanqiaodian, Maji, Minglidian, Yuanqiangji, Santaji, Renzumiao, and Shuangheji, and then occupied Cihepu in Fuyang County. This is the fourth time they passed through and ravaged the area. On September 9, the Huo Xiao bandits sneaked from Longwangtang and Huaji in Fuyang to Shuizipu and Caimiao Dahuangmiao, and occupied them for three days. They passed through Lixingji and Cishengji, and then broke through the city of Luyi County in Henan Province. This is the fifth time they passed through and ravaged the area. In total, these five occupations and raids lasted for more than a month. The burning and slaughtering exceeded those of Chuang and Xian. Wherever the iron horse stepped, every family fled for their lives like bees. The ropes pulled, and wave after wave of people were driven like pigs. The fire of the dark wind consumed food and houses, leaving nothing behind. The banners of opposition to Japan were raised, but the livestock and people were already without survivors. The bones were scattered across the fields, and the blood flowed into ditches. The sad and tragic sights were unbearable to speak of. The entire county is only about a hundred li wide, and it has been ravaged by bandits and turned into scorched earth. Now that the golden wind is blowing and the jade dew is falling, it is evident that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will have no home, no clothes to keep warm, and no food to eat. They will surely freeze and starve to death. Our association witnessed this and was heartbroken and disturbed. We have decided to raise funds locally and find ways to rescue them. However, the disaster is serious and the number of refugees is large. A drop in the bucket is not enough to solve the problem. Therefore, we have specially appointed Chen Xia-fu and</p>
<p>Gao Ji-zhi to go to your esteemed association to make a sincere appeal, hoping that you will extend your benevolent kindness to save the disaster victims. Then those who accumulate good deeds will surely have more blessings, and those who receive grace will never forget the favor. Looking forward to your kindness, we will be extremely grateful.

<h3 id="e122">Workers from the Sanyou Factory Petitioned the District Court Yesterday: Requesting the Enforcement of the Municipal Government's Ruling <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Company's main factory in Pudong, since the Municipal Government organized an arbitration committee last year, has resulted in the employer filing a lawsuit. The lawsuit was rejected in all three trials. In April of this year, the Supreme Court sent the case to the Shanghai District Court for enforcement in accordance with the arbitration ruling. Although the court has summoned both parties for reconciliation more than ten times, it has been to no avail because the employer has no sincerity. The workers, considering that the employer is as stubborn as ever and that the court is delaying enforcement, and with autumn turning into winter, are extremely anxious about the future. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the workers specially sent representatives Ni Zhong-yu, Sun Shou-ming, Kuang Wen-long, and others, more than a hundred people, holding petition banners and wearing symbols, to petition the District Court in formation. The president of the court was absent due to returning to his hometown, so the chief clerk, Wang Dao-zhou, received them on behalf of the court. First, the representatives stated their opinions, saying that the Sanyou labor dispute was sent to the court for enforcement in April of this year, and it has been six months. Since the other party is stubbornly unrepentant, they requested the court to enforce the law as soon as possible. The court representative expressed acceptance and introduced the judge in charge of the case, Pang Shu-rong, to meet with them so that they could fully express the court's main purpose regarding this case. Judge Pang then said that the court hoped that both parties would reach a voluntary settlement, but it was not fulfilled. He expressed that the court would enforce the law in accordance with the schedule on the 24th of this month and asked everyone to wait patiently. The representatives considered it satisfactory and returned.</p>

<p>Workers Yan Cheng-bao and Xu Fu-zhang both work at a factory on Pinlang Road and are very close friends, going in and out together. There is also a labor hospital located near the Maode Lane nearby. At around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, just as various factories were letting out workers, six or seven men suddenly came to the entrance of the Maode Lane labor hospital, hiding in the lane, seemingly with intentions. However, since there were no actions at the time, it was impossible to know their intentions. When the factories sounded their whistles to let out workers, Yan and Xu left the factory together and walked home. When they reached the entrance of Maode Lane, one of the men hiding in the lane suddenly rushed out and blocked Yan's path. At the same time, the rest of the gang swarmed up and surrounded Yan. The man who had blocked the path then raised a pre-prepared axe and chopped it down at Yan.</p>

<p>However, Yan had great strength and, seeing that things were not going well, quickly used his right hand to parry the axe handle, took the opportunity to jump out of the encirclement, and ran away, shouting for help. Xu Fu-zhang was still behind Yan. Seeing this, he also ran forward to chase the assailant. Because they were about a dozen yards away, the assailant noticed Xu early. Taking advantage of Xu's unpreparedness, he turned around and chopped at Xu with the axe. As a result, Xu's head was struck by the axe, and he immediately fell to the ground. The assailant then chopped again at Xu's foot and tried to escape. Xu screamed in pain, which was heard by Constable No. 1083 nearby. The constable rushed to the scene and, seeing the situation, quickly drew his gun and gave chase. When he caught up, the assailant was extremely violent.</p>

<p>He turned around and fought the constable with the axe. The other gang members also surrounded the constable from all directions, trapping him in the center, and tried to seize his gun. The constable fought bravely against them. The thugs, seeing that they could not succeed, the assailant with the axe chopped at the constable's left hand. After being injured, the constable quickly fired three shots at the assailant who was committing the crime and resisting arrest. He was shot dead on the spot. The rest of his accomplices fled for their lives, so they were not captured. The injured constable quickly took a car back to the Putuo Road police station to report the incident. A large number of detectives were dispatched to search and pursue the gang. At the same time, Xu Fu-zhang, who was injured in the line of duty, was rushed to the hospital for treatment. However, Xu's injuries were very serious, and his life was not yet assured. The body of the assailant who was shot dead on the spot has been taken to the morgue for examination. Afterwards, Yan Cheng-bao also went to the Putuo Road police station to report the facts of the incident, and said that he recognized the dead assailant as Wang Chang-gui, a reactionary element among the workers. Wang had incited labor unrest in the past, which was discovered and reported by Yan, and therefore held a grudge and committed this crime.</p>

<p>--The boss, Chen Qian-yi, one name, 19 gamblers, gambling equipment, and three cars seized on the spot--</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department suddenly received a tip that Chen Qian-yi, a well-known gangster and gambler from Guangdong, and others in Zhabei, within the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the Fifth District, had recently pooled money to establish a large-scale gambling den at No. 10 Anning Lane, Zhongzhou Road. The furnishings inside were extremely luxurious, with roulette, pai gow, and Sic Bo, everything was available, and many greeters were hired to socialize with the gamblers. Therefore, every evening when the lights came on, there were shadows and bustling activity, with people and vehicles coming and going. Those entering and leaving were all upper-class figures. Millions were wagered nightly, and the smoke-filled couches were filled with people blowing smoke and shouting all night long. However, because it was handled properly, it has not been busted until now. After Commissioner Wen learned of this, he sternly ordered the Inspection Division the day before yesterday to assign two inspectors and eight police officers from the police brigade, carrying weapons, to go undercover to make arrests. After receiving the order, the officers drove to the location of the gambling den at around 8 PM the night before last, disguised as gamblers to enter. However, because it was too early, there were few gamblers. The officers then arrested the boss, Chen Qian-yi, and 19 gamblers, including Zhu Kang-you, along with various gambling equipment, smoking equipment, and roulette wheels, loaded them onto three trucks, and took them back to the headquarters. After Commissioner Wen interrogated them, he ordered that the arrested criminals be temporarily detained and then handed over to the Third Section for separate strict handling. Meanwhile, he continued to send officers to pursue the important fugitives from the gambling den who were at large.</p>

<p>--The murderer, Gu Fu-tao, sentenced to life imprisonment--</p>
<p>Gu Fu-tao, a farmer from Baiyangzhai on the border of Baoshan County in northern Wusong, killed his wife because his wife, Xiao-mei, was having an affair with Long A-gou, which caused a widespread scandal. Fu-tao secretly found out the details and had thoughts of murder. Then, on the night of July 1, while his wife was fast asleep, he killed her with an axe. He then dismembered the body into ten pieces, stored them in a wooden bucket, and hid them in the woodpile in the wall. He planned to escape alone the next morning at dawn. However, he was discovered by neighbors, who stopped him halfway and took him to the Baoshan County government. This was reported in this newspaper on July 3. It is now learned that the case was repeatedly interrogated by the judge He Rui-lin sent by County Magistrate Jin, and the adulterer Gong A-gou was also arrested. Gu Fu-tao admitted without hesitation that he killed his wife with an axe and dismembered her. Yesterday, the verdict was announced. The defendant, Gu Fu-tao, dismembered and killed a person, and should be punished in accordance with Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Criminal Law. However, it was found that the defendant's personality was usually kind, and the motive for his crime was indeed provoked. After considering the circumstances, there is a reason for leniency. One-third of the original sentence should be reduced in accordance with Article 77 of the same law, and in accordance with Article 79, Paragraph 2 of the same law, he should be sentenced to life imprisonment. The adulterer Gong A-gou was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for having consensual intercourse with a married woman.</p>

<p>--The deceased was named Wu Lian and suffered from economic hardship--</p>
<p>At around 6 PM the day before yesterday, a teenager suddenly checked into the Lao Dafang Inn at No. 55 Puqing Lane, Fujian Road in the Public Concession. He claimed to be named Wu Lian. The inn's accountant opened Room 33 for him. After the tea server brought in tea and water, the teenager closed the door and went to sleep. However, at around 12 PM yesterday, the tea servers saw that the teenager had not yet gotten up, so they knocked on the door and called him, but there was no response for a long time. They became suspicious and asked a carpenter to find a way to open the door and enter. They then saw the teenager lying stiffly in bed, with a pale face and liquid gurgling out of his mouth. His breathing was as faint as a thread. They knew that he had taken poison and immediately reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. A car was dispatched to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, because the poison had taken too deep, he could not be saved and died. The hospital notified the police station, who transferred the body to the morgue to be examined. The court was notified to conduct an examination this morning, and a suicide note was found on the deceased's body, stating that he had taken this action because he was suffering from economic hardship. The clothes he was wearing were a free cloth long gown, suit pants, gauze underwear, woolen shirt, yellow leather shoes, and felt hat. Other than that, he had no other possessions. The police station is currently investigating the relatives of the deceased.</p>

<p>The premises at No. 536 Sichuan Road and Beijing Road, recently rented and opened as a gambling hall by Liang Gui-hua from Guangdong, was exceptionally large in scale and well-equipped. There were more than 60 gamblers every day. The house was three stories high. The second floor was divided into three rooms, set up as gambling halls. The third floor was the total gambling room, reading and exchanging chips, calculating the gains and losses of the gamblers. Day and night, it was merry and high-spirited, with very large winnings and losses. However, in order to avoid the attention of the police authorities, a bronze plaque was hung at the door, with the words "Yue Zhuang Xiang Fa Hao" written on it, pretending to be a commercial firm. On the back of the bronze plaque, the eight characters of "Five Direction Kings, Land Lords, and Gods of Wealth" were engraved, which were used as a secret sign to instruct gamblers. It was discovered by the General Police Headquarters. At 10:10 PM the day before yesterday, detectives Lu Gen-sheng, Zhang Ming-de, inspector Geng De-biao, Liu Xiang-zhai, and constables Li Wen-bin and Zhang Xiao-lin were ordered to secretly go to the address to arrest them. The boss Liang Gui-hua, the bookkeeper Wang Si, Zheng Jiu, and the gamblers Luo Xuan, Zhou Tang, Feng Qing, Zhen Han-ping, Zhang Lin, Xiao Quan, Gao He, and Chen Wei (all from Guangdong), totaling 25 people, were arrested. Gambling equipment, pai gow dice, and other gambling money worth more than 130 yuan, as well as chips and gambling books, were seized and taken back to the police station.

<p>--Accomplices Still Need to Be Arrested, Postponed for Seven Days--</p>
<p>Zheng Jin-long, a gangster (nicknamed Old Goods Jin-long) who lived at No. 3 Sanxin Lane, Dagu Road, had a feud with his fellow gangster Wang Xu-qing (nicknamed Little Master) due to gambling. Wang, at 6:40 AM on July 31 last year, gathered two accomplices, each holding a pistol and axe, and broke into Zheng's house. Without asking why, they chopped at Zheng indiscriminately. As a result, Zheng was struck by nine axes and fell to the ground seriously injured. The assailants fled in a rush. After someone reported it to the Xin Zha Police Station, Zheng was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The court was requested to issue a warrant for the arrest of Wang Xu-qing. However, Wang knew that the situation was urgent after the incident and that he could not stay in Shanghai, so he left Shanghai for Wuhan. After a year, he thought that the situation had cooled down and that the matter had been forgotten, so he secretly returned to Shanghai and hid in the French Concession. However, he was discovered by detective Zhu Meng-wei and officer Hang Fa-lin of the Xin Zha Police Station. At noon the day before yesterday, they secretly went to Klock Road in the French Concession, disguised as laborers, and waited. Before long, Wang Xu-qing came face to face, and they arrested him and took him back to the Xin Zha Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yao-tang, described the case and requested that the case be postponed so that the accomplices could be arrested. The defendant Wang Xu-qing admitted that the matter was done together with his accomplices Huang Dou, Lao Er, and the little hooligan A-jin and others, and that he was holding an axe at the time. Lawyer Fan Gang was hired to defend him in court. After Judge Xue Lan-ru verified the confession, he ordered Wang to be detained pending investigation and re-examination of the accomplices in seven days.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 13th of this month, at 8:30 PM, the Hsieh Lung Tobacco Company at 763 Niu Chuang Road was suddenly invaded by five or six armed bandits, who robbed more than 2,000 dollars in cash. The company reported the case to the police and requested an investigation.  Huang Yongji, the Chinese detective chief of the Mixed Court Police Station, and detective Tao Afu, learned that the gang of robbers was hiding at 375 Zhoujiazuilu Road in a "tiger stove" (a public stove), secretly gathering and plotting, and also peeking at the business situation of a certain hardware store across the street, hoping to rob it. Therefore, at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the location with Western detectives and arrested Wu Tianxiu and Han Changli, both from Zhenjiang. Afterwards, they went to room 22 of the Yu Tong Hotel on Hanzhong Road in Zhabei, together with the Public Security Bureau, and arrested two more accomplices, Chen Guangrong, a man from Jiangbei, and a woman, Dong Heshi. They were taken to the police station one after another and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendants confessed in the police station that they were involved in the robbery of the Hsieh Lung Tobacco Company. Wu Tianxiu was outside acting as a lookout at the time, and although Han and Chen did not go to the robbery together, they were both present during the discussion. Dong Heshi was the one who privately transported the stolen firearms. Therefore, the case still needs to be investigated, and he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Judge Wu questioned the defendants and ordered them to be detained separately and the hearing rescheduled for further investigation.</p>

<p>Lu Yaojiang, a native of Haimen, opened the Da Shun Tobacco and Paper Store at No. 79 Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession. Recently, he had a strange idea: he swapped the cigarette packs of various tobacco companies for lottery tickets and sold them at the store for 120 cash each. He also prominently displayed a sign in front of the store advertising the sale of these lottery tickets, which attracted the attention of passersby. Many people who wanted to get rich rushed to the store to buy them, and business was quite good. The French police found out and, believing that his private sale of lottery tickets violated the regulations of the Municipal Council, sent detectives to the store the day before yesterday and confiscated 1,372 Binlang brand cigarette lottery tickets, 597 Hongyun brand cigarette lottery tickets, 144 Haole brand tickets, and many other tickets such as Gaoerfu, Xuangong, Sanhua, Sanbei, Hongshi, and Da Lian Zhu. The shop owner Lu Yaojiang and his assistant Rong Fanrong were arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Qiu interrogated them. First, the police station's lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the facts of the case and presented the lottery tickets.

They found a handgun and ten bullets on Wang. After questioning them, they learned the location where their accomplices were hiding and went to room 215 of the Yingbin Hotel at 21 Zhejiang Road, where they arrested another suspect, Cao Zhangqing, from Tongzhou. They were all escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning. The police station's lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the circumstances of the arrest, saying that the investigation revealed that the defendants were repeat offenders with a record of robbery convictions. They were planning to rob a resident's property on Gongping Road, but fortunately, the detectives learned of their plan and apprehended them. He requested permission to detain them and presented the gun and bullets for inspection. Wang Yulin confessed that he and Jin Arong had crossed the Huangpu River from Pudong and landed at the Gongping Wharf, intending to find his friend Zhou Yilong, who was a foreman at the Yihe Yarn Factory. He met Cao Zhangqing on the way, who said he urgently needed to defecate and asked Wang to temporarily hold the handgun for him. Unexpectedly, they were caught by the Chinese and Western detectives. Wang also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. Sun Hongshan confessed that he knew Jin Arong and wanted to visit a friend at the Caojiadu Yarn Factory, but was arrested on the way.

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, Mr. Koji Matsumoto, the owner of the Matsumoto Parking Company on Zhapu Road in this city, returned to Japan on the Nagasaki Maru on the 11th. On the afternoon of the 14th, when the ship arrived in Kobe, he was suddenly found dead from taking sleeping pills.

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, his automobile business has been quite successful. In less than three years, his profits reached 30,000 yuan. During the incident, the Japanese side did not have enough cars, and Matsumoto was able to cope with the situation by using Chinese merchants. He also worked as a driver at the Consulate General and was a well-known figure in the Japanese automobile business. Later, due to expansion, he lost more than 20,000 yuan and fell into a state of neurasthenia, so he committed suicide by taking sleeping pills.</p>

<p>Chen Zhuqing, a woman from Zhenjiang, is 22 years old this year. She was living in her hometown, earning a living by working because her family was poor. In 1929, she was lured to Shanghai by traffickers and sold to Xie Xushi, also known as Xu Laoliu, a woman from Jiangbei who runs a brothel at No. 4 Fushou Lane on Avenue Ernest Billet in the French Concession, to work as a prostitute. Because the woman's appearance is beautiful, her business is the best of all the prostitutes in the brothel. However, the evil madam is unreasonable and relies on her evil influence to abuse Chen. Even though Chen is suffering from syphilis, she is still forced to receive customers and is not allowed to rest and recuperate. Because she could not bear the suffering, she took advantage of an opportunity to take her clothes and ornaments and run away on the 24th of last month, and went to Lawyer Wu Jue for legal assistance. She filed a self-complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the brothel madam Xie Xushi, also known as Xu Laoliu, and the pimp Xie Hongru and his wife, of profiting by forcing a good woman into prostitution and all kinds of abuse, and requested that they be investigated and dealt with according to law. After the woman ran away, the brothel madam reported to the French police, accusing the woman of stealing things and running away, and requested an investigation and arrest. The constable arrested the woman the day before yesterday and escorted her to the Second Special District Court yesterday to be prosecuted on charges of theft. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Qiu interrogated her in the Eighth Criminal Court. First, the police station's lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the facts of the case, and then the plaintiff Xu Laoliu recounted the defendant's theft and escape, and hired lawyer Wang Shizong to act as her agent, requesting an incidental private prosecution to recover the stolen goods. When questioned, the defendant Chen Zhuqing denied the theft, and lawyer Wu Jue defended her. After the court verified the statements, it announced that it would postpone the hearing for further interrogation. The court has issued summonses for Chen's self-complaint against the brothel madam and others, and they will be served on both parties, and the trial will be held on the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>The case of the strike by workers at the Fulun Heng Twin Palace Silk Factory at the bottom of Hongkou Baolu has had many twists and turns. Here is the news from yesterday:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: The workers of the Fulun Twin Palace Factory went on strike on the afternoon of the 6th because they opposed the strict management of Shen Xiangqing, the manager of the factory. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 16th, it was recognized that the workers' strike was not in accordance with the rules, and the capital was ordered to not be too strict in its management. It was agreed that work would resume the next day, and the dispute would be resolved. Yesterday morning at 5:45, the factory sounded the whistle to start work in order to comply with the orders of the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, only half of the workers arrived, and they stood at the factory gate without entering immediately. After the factory manager personally persuaded them, they went to work inside.</p>
<p>Strike Again: When the factory started work, the Fourth District Silk Industry Union sent people to supervise again. The factory asked the union to persuade the 200 workers who did not report to work as scheduled to return to work in the afternoon. However, not only did the number of people not increase after the lunch break, but the workers who were already working also went on strike again. The factory has decided to continue to start work this morning and pay the wages for this month. If the workers still do not resume work, it will temporarily shut down in order to make the workers realize their mistake, and plans to petition the party and government agencies to severely punish the instigators of the strike.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Creating the Content of the Rose Garden New Village <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is the most prosperous city in the country, but it is also very troublesome. Those who live here often suffer from working hard all day and have difficulty finding a place to rest. Moreover, the rent is surprisingly high, and most of the monthly income is spent on rent, but it is still narrow and difficult to live in, which is really regrettable. New village projects are most popular in European and American countries, but in our country, although there have been proposals, few have been implemented. Recently, entrepreneurs such as Mr. Zhang Yongnian initiated the organization of the China New Village Construction Society. First, 100 acres of land will be opened up in West Shanghai to build the Rose Garden New Village. The environment is beautiful and the scale is grand. The perfection of the design is unmatched in the East and West. Its facilities not only solve the problem of housing, but also have detailed plans for children's education, women's employment, etc. The village has a community center, primary school, kindergarten, home assistance group, family craft room, sports field, etc., to create a complete family. The standard of living is standardized and the economy is rationalized. What is even better is that anyone who joins the village can choose to build according to the house plan they have prepared, and the land price and construction costs can be paid in installments, like paying for a house. This not only avoids the difficulty of raising a large sum of money to buy property, but also compared to renting a house and paying a large amount of rent every month, no matter how many years later, the house still belongs to the landlord, which is much cheaper. The picture on the left is one of the house plans in the new village, designed by architect Qian Changgan. The A-type house, including land price, construction cost, and equipment such as flowers, trees, and lawns, costs a total of 9,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e144">The Twenty-Fifth District Branch of the Municipal Federation Holds a Meeting: Submitting a Case to Party and Government Agencies Regarding the Water Cutoff by the Landlord of Fengleli <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Twenty-Fifth District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation on North Sichuan Road held a meeting yesterday. All executive members attended and elected Wei Langxuan as chairman. The meeting was held as usual. The purpose of the meeting was reported and the agenda was announced. The following was discussed: (1) Secretary Guan Jichuan proposed that the previous committee intended to provide 10,000 yuan in relief funds to disaster-stricken merchants in the district in principle, and the method of distribution has been reported to the Public Security and Finance Bureaus and forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval. Now it intends to formulate detailed rules and regulations, and requests a public decision on the case. It was resolved to pass the proposal. (2) Four members, including Li Guangyu, Yucheng, and Changsheng, followed the Municipal Government's regulations and paid the housing donation on behalf of the Shengshan Zhen paid the housing donation on behalf of the owner, deducting the original housing donation from the rent. However, the owner refused to accept it and deliberately resisted the housing donation, relying on foreign forces to exert pressure, and the tenants were innocent and burdened. Negotiations have been ignored. Therefore, it is requested that assistance be provided. It was resolved to send a letter to the Public Security Fifth Sub-bureau and transfer it to the Finance Bureau for handling. (3) More than 20 households of members in North Fengleli jointly applied because the water supply in the area has been cut off by the owner, China Business Leasing Company, since July 14. During the three meetings, only drinking water was supplied for one day. This disregards the livelihood of the people and at the same time stops collecting rent, using the pretext of rent arrears, and repeatedly makes false accusations to the local court, forcing them to leave their homes. Its methods are bad and its intentions are sinister (the court's files can be checked). It is requested that the local authorities be called upon to restore the water source and compensate for the loss of purchasing water. It was resolved to first submit a request to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, the Health Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau to quickly restore drinking water and attach importance to the livelihood of the people. (4) The association's finances are strained. It was resolved to collect membership fees to subsidize the association's affairs. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Tangshan Alumni Association Welcomes Old Classmates of Shanhaiguan Railway Official School <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The current Tangshan College of Engineering of Jiaotong University originally evolved from the Shanhaiguan Railway Official School. The Shanhaiguan Official School was founded in the 22nd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty and produced many engineering talents. During the Boxer Rebellion, the school building was destroyed and the school was closed. Later, Mr. Gu Liffei, a British engineer who was in charge of the school, used his accumulated funds to establish the Tangshan Mining School, which was passed down and continued in the same scale. It is actually two in one. After the establishment of the Tangshan Railway and Mining School, the name was changed several times, and it is now named Tangshan College of Engineering of Jiaotong University. Since the founding of the Republic of China, many graduates have been well-known at home and abroad in the engineering field for a long time. In particular, the graduates of the Shanhaiguan Railway School have made pioneering contributions in the railway and other engineering fields in our country, and their reputation is outstanding. They originally belonged to the same origin. The alumni associations in Tianjin and Wuhan have already been in contact with each other, regardless of each other. Yesterday, the Shanghai branch of the Tangshan Alumni Association gathered again at the Dachunghua Restaurant on Sichuan Road to welcome the old classmates of Shanhaiguan who came to Shanghai and join the association. Dozens of people arrived at one time. The Shanhaiguan classmates included Zhang Xiaoji, Qiu Liangcai, Zhang Tingrong, Xu Wenhui, Zhou Lin, and Jiang Guanying. Zhang Xiaoji, Qiu Liangcai, and Tangshan classmates Shi Jiagan and Jiang Shaoying all gave speeches and were very happy. It was decided on the spot to move the Tangshan Shanyou Association to the Chinese Engineers Association on the upper floor of the Continental Mall on Nanjing Road, and entrust Zhang Xiaoji to contact them. After the location is determined, a notice will be published in newspapers to inform the Shanhaiguan and Tangshan classmates at home and abroad and the branch offices of the alumni associations in various places to announce the original committee and solicit unanimous cooperation.</p>

<p>▲Men's Swimming Finals Set Four More National Records</p>
<p>Today's Finals: Soccer, Baseball, Men's and Women's Tennis, Men's Basketball, Women's Volleyball</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The results of the ninth day of the National Games have completely revealed the situation: the men's and women's overall championships have been won by Shanghai's Iron Army. Today saw the finals of six events: soccer, baseball, men's and women's tennis, men's basketball, and women's volleyball. Four more national records were set in swimming today. The Games will conclude on the 19th, and the closing and awards ceremony will be held at 10:00 am on the 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Shanghai Wins Men's Overall Championship <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of ten men's championships. As of yesterday, Shanghai had already won the track and field, all-around, and volleyball championships. Although the other six championships—soccer, basketball, tennis, baseball, swimming, and martial arts—will only be decided today, soccer is being contested by Shanghai and Guangdong, basketball by Shanghai and Hebei, and tennis by Shanghai and Sichuan. Shanghai has a great chance in all of them. Even if there are changes and Hebei and Sichuan each win one championship, if both the baseball championship, being contested by Ping and Guangdong, and the swimming championship, being contested by Hong Kong and Guangdong, are won by Guangdong, then Guangdong will only have three championships, while Shanghai already has four. Moreover, Guangdong did not participate in martial arts. Therefore, the men's overall championship was already won by Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Shanghai Also Wins Women's Overall Championship <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>As for the women's events, there are a total of seven championships. Shanghai has already won the track and field and basketball championships. In today's volleyball championship, being contested by Shanghai and Beiping, Shanghai has a very high chance. Even if there is a problem and Beiping wins, and if Sichuan and Shanxi each win the tennis championship, Ping, Sichuan and Shanxi will only win one championship each, which has nothing to do with Shanghai. Although Guangdong has already won the softball championship yesterday, Guangdong has no hope in the swimming championship, which will definitely be won by Hong Kong. Guangdong did not participate in martial arts. Therefore, Shanghai has also won the women's overall championship.</p>
<p>Men's Volleyball</p>
<h3 id="e161">Shanghai Wins Men's Volleyball Championship: Straight Sets Victory Over Guangdong, South China Volleyball Loses to Shanghai for the First Time in History <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) In the men's volleyball final, Shanghai defeated Guangdong. Thousands of spectators gathered at the venue. Guangdong's strength was not great. In yesterday's semi-final, Shanghai defeated Hong Kong, which was very tense. In the final, Shanghai did not have any special performance, but defeated Guangdong in straight sets to win the championship. The scores were 21-19, 21-15, and 21-18. This is the first time in history that South China has lost to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Spectators Gather Under Renowned Names <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>According to the championship rules, the game was scheduled to start at 3:00 pm. The venue only had one stand, with very few seats. The fans in Nanjing, because of the average strength of the two teams and the fact that this was the final game, expected one of the most exciting volleyball games. Therefore, the seats were already full before 2:00 pm, and both stands were packed by around 3:00 pm. The surrounding high ground was also crowded with people. The number of people was probably over five or six thousand. The Boy Scouts were very busy maintaining order, and the spectators were also very busy watching the ball go east and west.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Unstoppable Momentum and Expedited Progress <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai team has many veterans from the Far East Games, and their coordination is seamless. Li Lianying and Ma Yuanchen of the Guangdong team are also famous players who have fought on the battlefield for a long time. At the start of the game, the scores were very close. In the first game, Shanghai only won by one point. Afterwards, the three players in the front row tried their best to block the net, creating a situation where one person guarded the pass and was unstoppable. The score gradually surpassed the others. Guangdong was unable to catch up and lost the first game with a score of 19-21.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Deceptive Moves and Clever Seizing <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>In the second game, Guangdong served, and the momentum was average. At 3-3, the Shanghai front row saw that the opponent was frequently applying pressure, so they abandoned pressing the ball and focused on closing the door. However, they successively touched the net and were penalized five points in a row, making the score 3-8. The situation was precarious, and Guangdong had a great chance to turn the tables. Fortunately, Qiu Guangxie came in dangerously and saved the situation single-handedly, opening a bloody path. At 10-10, Guangdong's ball was sent to the front row by the middle row. Zhang Qun first saw the ball accurately, and pressed it lightly. Due to a difference of several points, the ball leaked into the zone and was self-destructive. At the change of sides, Guangdong took a one-point lead. Seeing that the opponent was very stubborn, and that Qiu Guangxie's big knife team had almost no way to use its methods, Shanghai suddenly adopted a clever attack. At the 12-12 tie, Xu Heng held the incoming ball, and Wang Jiajun moved his hand to the east, while pressing the ball to the west. Guangdong could not prevent it and lost the fortress. This scene was the most exciting. From then on, Shanghai's momentum was revived and it won the second game 21-15.</p>

<p>After the second game, both sides rested briefly to prepare for the third game, in which they would open fire. The leaders of both sides convened a military meeting to discuss strategies. Guangdong also added new force, Liu Zemin, to replace Xiao Dianlian. With three axes on the court, Shanghai could not resist. In addition, the sun was so strong that it was difficult to see.</p>

<p>Therefore, at 11-6, the first half was completed. After the field and backs were adjusted to face the sun, Xu Heng, Cao Tingzan and other team players applied a backhand technique and pressed the passing balls over the net. This evened the score 18. Shanghai then did not simply allow their last 5 minutes to be wasted. The front-row players then bravely charged forth and waged hand-to-hand combat. The Guangdong defence was duly disorientated. In turn, Shanghai was able to gain three more points to win the third match 21-18. The referee Tao Shaofu then announced that the final score was 3-0, and Shanghai won the Volleyball Championship!</p>

<p>To be held at 3 PM this afternoon</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th Dispatch) The women's volleyball semi-finals were held from 9:00 AM on the 18th. The Shanghai-Guangdong performance was wonderful. As a result, Shanghai actually won straight through to the championship with consecutive victories against Sichuan. Hopes are extremely high. Hong Kong versus Beiping, an intense battle. Beiping defeated Hong Kong 3-1. Hebei obtained the rights for the finals. The defeat of Guangdong and Hong Kong can be called a major change in women's volleyball history. Shanghai defeated Guangdong, 23-21, 21-18, 21-13. Beiping defeated Hong Kong, 16-21, 25-23, 21-9, 21-17.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Shanghai Actually Defeated Guangdong <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲ Result: Straight Set Victory of Three</p>
<p>In the women's volleyball semi-final, Shanghai vs. Guangdong was quite tense. As a result, Shanghai won three to zero. The scores were 23-21, 21-18, 21-13. The final will be held on the 19th, with a bright future.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Ladies Worked Hard</p>
<p>Around 9 o'clock, referee Gao Xiwei was on the scene. Both Shanghai and Guangdong had supporters cheering from behind the scenes, with powerful and radiant momentum, each with great ambition. Shanghai ladies went south, Xiao Jieying sent out troops and lost generals, gaining nothing. The daughters of Southern Yue rose up and claimed supremacy, scoring four consecutive points. Shanghai worked hard, and seeing Xiao Zhijie coordinating back and forth, she succeeded immediately, creating a 4-4 tie. But just as the waves were calming, a hurricane arose again. Guangdong quickly pursued and scored three more points. Shanghai's Qian Shuyi did not flinch. Seeing the approaching ball, she jumped high over the net, and the ball died in the Guangdong zone. From then on, Shanghai had smooth sailing, ending the first half with 11 to 10. In the second half, Guangdong rose up again to meet the challenge, but their skills in saving险 were no match. In the midst of the fierce battle, the scores reached 21 each. The Shanghai team served, and Xue Zhijie was brave and resourceful. The ball landed in an area where no one was guarding, and Hong Kong went all out to save it but failed. In the second ball, the Shanghai team's front row blocked the ball very well, winning first with 23 to 21.</p>
<p>▲ Daughters of Southern Yue Succumb</p>
<p>The generals of Guangdong are good at attacking, but one small mistake will negate the entire plan. The second set also started strongly, once creating a 6 to 1 lead with a very clever killing technique. But there were people rushing in front, while the back was empty. At 9 to 8, Shanghai scored three consecutive points. In the next set, both sides had no amazing performances. Shanghai, relying on an empty fort strategy, defeated Guangdong again with 21 to 18. In the third set, Shanghai's Li Po was tired and could not enter the game. She was replaced by Miss Wang Xuehua. The new force was outstanding, seizing key positions. At that time, Shanghai's momentum was rampant, and the second and third rows made many saves. Although the Guangdong ladies combined offense and defense, it was still difficult to turn the tide. They were defeated 11 to 8. In the next round, Guangdong did not slack off due to the loss. General Situ Wei was even more active. The Shanghai ladies were repeatedly surrounded, but fortunately, the back was reliable, and they saved the ball. However, their cherry lips were smeared with rouge, and their bodies were half-covered in hot sweat. The Shanghai ladies then won with a fierce attack and cheering, defeating the famous Guangdong team three straight. The tables have turned. In the championship match between Shanghai and Beiping on the 19th, we will see the spoiled and pampered ladies of the Shanghai team roar like the lioness of Hedong.</p>

<p>Since Beiping and Hong Kong each won one game, the third game was indeed the lifeline for both sides. Intense competition was expected. As expected, the Beiping team first obtained 20 points, while the Hong Kong team followed with 19 points. Then Hong Kong won another point, resulting in a tie of 20 to 20, and then 21 to 21, 22 to 22, and 23 to 23. But the Beiping team finally took the lead with 25 and fortunately won this game. As a result, Hong Kong was defeated by Beiping. In the last game, the Hong Kong team worked hard to counterattack, and the strength of the team increased even more. The Beiping team took the lead with 11 to 7 and then changed sides. Afterwards, Beiping continued to lead, and the Hong Kong team worked hard to follow, but ultimately lost with a score of 17 to 21. The total score was 3 to 1, with Beiping winning.</p>
<p>▲ Both Sides Have Their Own Merits in Skill</p>
<p>Regarding the skills of both sides, they seem to be different. The Hong Kong team is good at killing,扣球, and serving, while the Beiping team is stable and good at defense. In this battle, the Beiping team used softness to overcome hardness. The skills of Hong Kong are a cut above, but their luck was not good.</p>

<p>Women's Softball</p>
<h3 id="e182">Guangdong Defeated Shanghai to Win the Championship ▲ Result: Eleven to Ten ▲ Shanghai Had a Great Advantage with Ten to Five in the First Five Innings ▲ Shanghai Pitcher Zou Shande Had Excellent Skills ▲ The Guangdong Team Was Good at Hitting and Won the Final Victory <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th Dispatch) The Shanghai-Guangdong women's softball final was held at 9:00 AM on the 18th. Shanghai's momentum was strong, and they had an advantage of ten to five in the first five innings. In the sixth inning, Guangdong broke the cauldron and tried to retaliate, hitting many safe hits. The Shanghai team's lineup was greatly panicked, and Guangdong scored six points in a row. As a result, Shanghai suffered a miserable defeat with ten to eleven. The championship fell into the hands of Guangdong.</p>
<p>▲ Pitching Technique</p>
<p>Regarding pitching technique, the Shanghai pitcher was Zou Shande, a high jump athlete, and her pitching skills were excellent. She killed two of three batters in a row when she went on the field, leaving Guangdong with no chance to develop. In the third inning, she killed one of three batters. Unexpectedly, in the sixth inning, her arm strength declined, and the balls she threw were weak. She was repeatedly hit by the opponent and suffered a miserable defeat by one point, which was a pity. As for the Guangdong pitchers, Zhong Shuqing in the first four innings and Ruan Rou in the last two innings, their skills were average. Shanghai's catcher Tang Yueying was not as stable as Guangdong's Zeng Shuyi. In terms of team lineup and arrangement, Shanghai seemed to be better, but their batting ability was not as good as the Guangdong team. Apart from Zeng Huiqiong, the outfielders in Shanghai were generally not confident. Half of Shanghai's large score loss in the sixth inning was due to the mistake of left fielder Xu Wenying, and there were also many errors on Shanghai's third base, which was the reason for the defeat.</p>
<p>▲ Taking the Initiative</p>
<p>Shanghai attacked first. At the beginning, Sun Zheng went on stage and got on base, followed by Li Baohui. Lu Puzhen and Meng Jian hit long balls, and Sun and Li survived. Guangdong made frequent mistakes and was embarrassed by ground balls. Meng, Zeng, and Tang took advantage of the opponent's mistakes and returned to base one after another, scoring five points in a row. When Guangdong went on stage, Zou Shande killed two of three batters in a row, killing two people. Mao Shaofang's high ball went off the field, and they were at a loss. Guangdong scored two points. Shanghai's Xu Wenying went on stage and sneaked to the base. Xiang Shaofen sent Xu back to base, scoring one point. Faced with this setback, they carefully guarded. Guangdong's third baseman Liang Shiyi caught Lu Puzhen's high ball and sent it to first base again, performing a double play. After switching sides, Guangdong's Wu Peiqi went down, and Huang Hanxian and Liang Shiyi hit safe hits in a row. Chen continued to return to base, scoring two points. The score in this inning was one to two. In total, Shanghai six, Guangdong two.</p>
<p>▲ Extreme Advantage</p>
<p>After Shanghai's Meng Jian's high ball was killed, Zeng Huiqiong hit a long ball. The left field made a mistake, and she safely landed on base. Pan Yueying sent Xu back to base, and Ren Shu and Zou Shande each hit a safe hit. Dang Ren also scored two points. Guangdong's Li Yu got a safe hit but went off the field without success. Shanghai then had an extreme advantage of nine to two. The championship seemed to be in the bag. Under the great defeat, Guangdong tried to cheer up, and their momentum gradually improved. In the fourth inning, the first three people in a row went down and failed to occupy base. Guangdong's Mao Shaofang went on stage, and her high ball was caught and died. Wu Peiqi hit a long ball and shot to the right. Zeng Huizhen missed, and the ball flew far out of the field. Wu safely returned to base. Huang Hanxian hit a safe hit, Liang Shiyi's high ball went off the field, and Zeng Shuyi also hit a home run, adding two more points. However, Shanghai still won with nine to five.</p>
<p>▲ Failure to Reach the Goal</p>
<p>In the fifth inning, Shanghai's Zeng, Pan, and Ren all went down with empty balls, and Guangdong's catching was very commendable. Guangdong also went down with three people in a row, with no progress. In the sixth inning, Shanghai's Xu Fuying hit a safe hit, and Sun Jing sent Xu back to base, scoring only one point. Guangdong's Mao Bingfang went on stage and was killed in three strikes, but the formation suddenly became chaotic afterwards. Zou Shande's arm strength declined, and Guangdong's momentum was greatly enhanced, scoring four points in a row. After Chen Jiaai's high ball went down, Lin Jie had already hit two empty balls, thinking there was hope of going down, but Shanghai lost again and again and lost two more points. At this time, Guangdong had already won with eleven to ten. After Ma Xingyan landed on base, Zhong Shuqing sent her back to base, but Zhong's foot stepped out of the line while hitting the ball, and the referee judged her foul and out of the game. Guangdong insisted that it was not allowed, and a dispute arose, and the game was stopped for about a quarter of an hour. After the base referee Wu Bangwei explained with all his strength, it was decided that Guangdong would be off the field, and Ma's one point would not count. In the seventh inning, Shanghai's counterattack was ineffective and they failed to reach their goal. Guangdong then won the championship. The ball referee was Hou Luoxun.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 18th Dispatch) The tennis championship competition of this National Games has a strange rule: any singles player cannot also play doubles. This has disadvantaged units that only sent two or three representatives to attend. The two generals, Xu Chengji and Lin Xuyin from Ba Bu, were praised by the general audience for their skills in the early rounds. A few days ago, they met the Shanghai team in the semi-finals. Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of the conference, they could not participate in doubles, and the Ba team was eliminated with a score of one to two. Mr. Xu and Mr. Lin were originally scheduled to bid farewell to the conference and leave Beijing on the 18th. However, they were retained by the tennis referee chief Ling Daoyang and changed their departure to the 19th. Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong believed that Xu and Lin had traveled thousands of miles to Beijing for the first time to participate in the conference and were pioneers of overseas Chinese, and their spirit was truly admirable. On the afternoon of the 18th, he hosted a farewell banquet at the Central Hotel and invited Ling Daoyang and others to accompany him. Huang presented two silver cups with the inscription "Victory Without Fighting". The guests and hosts gathered together in a lively atmosphere, and they took photos and dispersed at 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>▲ Please See Whose World It Is Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th Dispatch) The Shanghai-Guangdong football championship competition of the National Games, which the people of the country are eagerly anticipating, will be held at the track and field at 3:00 PM today. At the beginning of the football championship, the strength of the Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong teams was recognized by the audience. The three teams themselves also recognized each other as strong opponents. In the semi-finals, Hong Kong unfortunately succumbed to Shanghai, while Guangdong defeated Hebei four to one. The two heroes of Shanghai and Guangdong then advanced into the finals and made their final efforts. The outcome of today's game, who will win and who will get the championship, cannot be said, and does not need to be said. Talent is concentrated from the southeast, and skills can be done with both head and feet. It is difficult to distinguish before the game. Then, what is the difference between high and low, male and female? We will see how calm their will is and whether their cooperation is consistent.</p>

<p>丨Shanghai and Hebei Will Compete in the Final This Afternoon丨</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th Dispatch) In the men's basketball semi-finals on the morning of the 18th, in the first game between Shanghai and Guangdong, when there were still four minutes left in the second half, and Shanghai was leading 31 to 22, Guangdong was dissatisfied with the referee Li Zuqi and left the field together. Guangdong was then judged to have abandoned the game, and Shanghai obtained the right to the final. In the second game between Beijing and Hebei, there were many highlights. The Hebei team's skills were amazing. As a result, Hebei won 57 to 28. Shanghai and Hebei are scheduled to compete in the final at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, and Hebei has high hopes.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Shanghai Defeated Guangdong <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>▲ Guangdong Abandoned the Game in the Last Four Minutes</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Had the Winning Advantage and Smooth Sailing</p>
<p>In the first game between Shanghai and Guangdong, Guangdong, due to a momentary misunderstanding four minutes before the end, was in a state of chaos and almost resorted to violence. Despite the persuasion of Dong Shouyi and others, they ignored the greater good and left the field, losing their sportsmanship. The referee announced that Guangdong had abandoned the game, and Shanghai won two to zero, obtaining the right to the final. The details of the game are as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Li Zuqi's Silver Whistle Sounded - Both Sides Put on Their Armor and Went into Battle - Shanghai's Wu Guolin Passed the Ball to Qian Jingyong - Qian Was Too Anxious and the Ball Was Obtained by Huang Shuli, Who Colluded with Huang Dingfen and Actually Opened the Scoring - Feng Nianhua Ambushed Under the Basket and Returned the Favor - Li Kerong Made Two Great Contributions - Guangdong Led Six to Two - But Bad Luck Came - Lu Zhongen Put the Ball In - Feng Nian and Guolin Hua Yuan Threw the Ball In - Wu Showed His Divine Skills - In a Flash, Shanghai Came Back from Behind and Won Ten to Six</p>
<p>▲ Huang Shuli Broke Through the Formation Alone - Qian Jingyong Secretly Made Contributions - Chen Xianglong Replaced Xiao Feng - The Defense Was More Solid - Qian Jingyong and Wu Guolin Threw the Ball In From Far and Near - Winning the First Half Twenty to Fourteen - In the Second Half, Guangdong Changed Its Strategy - Its Actions Were Sometimes Excessive - Shanghai Took the Opportunity to Attack, Which Was More Desirable - Qian Jingyong Launched an Attack From the Western Frontier - Putting the Ball In With His Body - Lu Zhongen Threw One and Made One Free Throw - Shanghai's Momentum Was Extremely Strong - Huang Dingfen Fought Hard Against the Enemy - Breaking Out of the Encirclement - Zheng Wokun Added Two Points - The Situation Changed Again</p>

<p>▲ The Guangdong Team Suddenly Misunderstood - The Reserve Team Members Entered the Field One After Another - Maintained by the Boy Scouts - It Did Not Cause Any Harm - But the Leader Led Them Off the Field - Unwilling to Continue the Game - A Stupid Thing - Shanghai Then Won Two to Zero</p>

<p>▲Hebei Team's Skillful Technique</p>
<p>▲Victorious by a Large Margin of 57 to 28</p>
<p>In the second match of the men's basketball semi-finals, Hebei faced Nanjing. Although Nanjing had defeated the Philippine Overseas Chinese team, they were ultimately no match for Hebei. Both sides of the court were completely dominated by Hebei.</p>
<p>▲Hebei Dominates Throughout  Zhao Shouchang scored one point on a free throw due to a foul by Wei Haiqing. Tang Baokun and Shen Yugong each scored with a layup. Xian Zhuanghuai responded in kind. After that, Hebei dominated throughout. Tang Baokun occasionally made steals, and Shen Yugong's shooting accuracy was exceptional. In an instant, Hebei had already scored twenty-two points. Nanjing called another timeout. Li Gongyu felt inspired by Zhuanghuai and made two shots. At halftime, Hebei led 32-12 over Nanjing.</p>
<p>▲Nanjing Constantly Submissive   In the second half, Hebei made numerous substitutions. Little Liu's technique was not inferior to Little Tang's, and Lian Su's skill was not diminished. Nanjing could only try to create difficulties. Liu Mengji made several long throws, but they still could not penetrate under the basket. Zhao Shouchang and Zhang Jingbao's interception skills were a cut above the rest. Shen Yugong's active running made him a talent to watch. Ma Qingzong's shooting for Nanjing was also commendable, scoring three baskets. Wei Haiqing, an old general, also made contributions, but they were ultimately no match for the divine prowess of the Hebei team. In the end, Hebei won 57-28, securing a spot in the finals.</p>

<p>▲Swimming Adds Events</p>
<p>▲To Increase Spectator Interest</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) Various ball game semi-finals and finals, as well as swimming preliminary and final events, are being held all day today. Spectators are very excited. In the women's softball final, Shanghai unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat, and the championship went to Guangdong. In the women's basketball final, Shanghai overcame Guangdong to win the championship. In the women's volleyball semi-finals, Shanghai eliminated Guangdong, and Beiping eliminated Hong Kong. Shanghai and Beiping secured qualification for the final. In the men's volleyball final, Shanghai defeated Guangdong in straight sets, winning the championship. In the men's basketball semi-finals, Shanghai and Guangdong parted on bad terms. The Guangdong team acted rudely, accusing the referee of being unfair. The team's coaches led the team off the field, and the match ended prematurely, which was contrary to the spirit of sportsmanship. Afterwards, they even attacked the referees, and the referees had to be escorted out by military police before peace was restored. The 19th is the last day of the games, and the ball game finals are well worth watching. After three days of competition, the swimming events are mostly complete, with only three or four events remaining. It is expected that the conclusion will be early. To increase spectator interest, the organizing committee added a mixed relay event of 150 meters, with three swimmers per team. The first swimmer swims 50 meters backstroke, the second swims 50 meters breaststroke, and the third swims 50 meters freestyle. A fancy diving event was also added, to be held after the official events are completed. Participants include Liu Baoxi, Bao, and Chen Zhenxing from Guangdong; Xu Heng and Wen Jingling from Shanghai; Guo Zhenxing, Wang Yaomin, and Liang Jin from Hong Kong; guests Yu Binqi and Xu Jingyun; and Shi Xinglong, as well as athletes from Qingdao, Nanjing, and Liaoning.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Zhang Boling Discusses the Need for a Large-Scale Physical Education Movement, Next All-China Games Still in Beijing in 1935, Preparations for Participation in the Far Eastern Games Have Begun <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) Chief Referee Zhang Boling told reporters on the 18th that many records have been broken at this All-China Games, proving that China's physical education has made significant progress. In particular, the athletes and officials have been able to abide by the rules and regulations without disputes, and the spirit of emphasizing sportsmanship is deeply admirable. However, there are still unfinished matches, such as the Shanghai-Liaoning soccer match and the Guangdong-Shanghai men's basketball match. This is the most undesirable thing about the Games. Athletes must endure any difficulties and fight to the end, which is the spirit they should have. Unexpectedly, after the Liaoning-Shanghai soccer dispute the other day, the Guangdong-Shanghai basketball match today ended on bad terms again. According to the referees' reports, both disputes were caused by intense competition during the matches, with the two teams arguing with each other, which is normal. However, spectators and athletes impersonating spectators made noises and shouted "fight," disturbing the athletes' spirit and disrupting the competition, resulting in the matches not being able to finish.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Large-Scale Physical Education Movement <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>This proves that the Chinese public does not yet understand the nature of competition and has a childish understanding of sports. Therefore, I strongly advocated at the banquet of President Wang yesterday that China should have a large-scale physical education movement to allow the general public to deeply understand the importance and nature of sports and then develop an interest in sports. If we continue to work hard from now on, the health of the Chinese nation will definitely make considerable progress in ten years. Currently, the government is using political power through the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education to order provincial and municipal governments to promote physical education. On the civilian side, there are also organizations such as the National Physical Education Association and regional physical education associations. With both sides working together, future progress can be expected.</p>

<p>The next All-China Games will still be held at the Central Stadium in 1935, which can be held every four years, alternating with the Far Eastern Games. Regional sports meets, such as those in North China, should be held once a year. Only after the provinces and cities have built complete and grand stadiums will they be qualified to invite the Games to be held in their province or city. If we promote this year by year, in a few years, all provinces and cities will have complete sports facilities. Next year's North China Games will be held in Tianjin. Tianjin is urgently proceeding with the proposal of a sports stadium. It is hoped that Central China, East China, and other regions will follow the North China method and gradually expand sports facilities year by year.</p>

<p>As for the preparations for the National Physical Education Association to participate in next year's Far Eastern Games,</p>
<p>it has been decided that the Standing Committee of the Association will form a separate committee to oversee everything. Regarding the selection of Chinese athletes to attend, the committee will collect opinions from all parties and carefully select them. The Association's regular expenses are very small. In addition to the annual payment of 25 yuan per unit, it is planned to contact the Ministry of Education to ask for a considerable subsidy. However, the Association's temporary expenses are quite large, such as all the expenses for attending the Far Eastern Games next year and the World Games in 1936. Currently, we are finding ways to raise funds.</p>

<p>▲Men's 1500m Freestyle Final (Nanjing, 18th) There were a total of seven participants in the 1500m final. Surprisingly, as many as three withdrew mid-race. As a result, only four people completed the entire distance. Shi Xingteng took the lead from the start and maintained the lead throughout, swimming tirelessly. He also possessed the prowess of his older brother, Xinglong, who won the one-mile freestyle title at the previous Hangzhou All-China Games. By the 750-meter mark, he had already surpassed the second-place swimmer by about 50 meters. Having completed the entire distance, he won by a margin of 160 meters over the second-place swimmer. The second-place swimmer, Guo Zhenheng, used the "W" style for one-third of the race. The future of the third-place swimmer, Shi Xinglong, is also very promising. The champion, Shi Xingteng's time of 23 minutes 27 seconds, broke the national record.</p>
<p>▲Men's 400m Freestyle Final  There were six participants. At the start, Chen Qisong from Guangdong and Shi Xingteng from Liaoning were neck and neck. But by the 200-meter mark, Shi had distanced himself from Chen by 30 meters. Chen seemed to be running out of steam and was overtaken by Wang Honglong from Fujian. Before long, Shi Shupe i from Guangdong also surpassed Chen by about one meter. Shi led all the way, finishing about 40 meters ahead of second-place Wang Honglong. Second place beat third place by about 5 meters, and third place beat fourth place by about 3 meters. Shi's time was 5 minutes 51.9 seconds, breaking Huang Maoyuan's national record of 6 minutes 8.8 seconds.</p>
<p>▲Women's 100m Freestyle Preliminary  The event was divided into two groups, with only four participants in each group. The top three from each group qualified. In the first group, Chen Huanqiong of Guangdong took first place, Yang Xiuqiong of Hong Kong took second, and He Wenya of Qingdao took third. When the second group started, the entire audience applauded like thunder, eager to see the Oriental standard beauty, Yang Xiuqiong, take the field. Yang did not disappoint and secured the title of the second group. Shi Xinglong's younger sister, Shi Ruisheng, was selected in the first group. She is young and weak, but her achievement is remarkable.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The Shanghai delegation is scheduled to return triumphantly by train at 8:00 AM on the 20th, with a few staying behind to receive awards.</p>
<p>Men's 100m Backstroke Final The Men's 100m Backstroke Final was held immediately after the 400m Final. Shi Xing and Shi Jinpei had both just finished swimming the 400m and were participating in this event again, so they were understandably out of breath. At the start, Liu Baoxi of Guangdong was the fastest, followed by Yang Yuanhua of Shanghai. Liu led all the way, while the other few competed with each other. By the 150-meter mark, Yang Yuanhua had suddenly dropped to fifth place. By the finish line, Liu Baoxi of Guangdong had beaten Chen Zhenxing of Guangdong by just a meter or so. The athletes in third, fourth, and fifth place were all very close. As a result, the first place had a time of 1 minute 23.3 seconds, breaking the national record, Liu Baoxi,</p>
<p>▲Men's 200m Relay Final Since there were not many teams participating in the 200m relay preliminary, it was directly changed to the final. A total of six teams participated in the final: Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shanghai, Fujian, Qingdao, and Beiping. The Guangdong team had many talented athletes, so they were in the lead from start to finish. The strength of the Hong Kong and Shanghai teams was also evident, and the competition was extremely fierce. As a result, the Guangdong team finished first, beating the Hong Kong team by about five meters. The Hong Kong team beat the Shanghai team by about one meter. The Shanghai team beat the fourth-place Qingdao team by about four meters. Here is a record of the names of the four teams, with a time of 2 minutes 1.1 seconds: (1) Guangdong Team: Chen Qisong, Liu Baoxi, Wang Xiushan, Chen Zhenxing (2) Hong Kong Team: Zeng Afu, Mai Weiming, Wu Zhiwen, Liang Weisheng, (3) Shanghai Team: Yu Rongbang, Yang Yuanhua, Yin Yanjun, Wen Jingling, (4) Qingdao Team: Zhu Delu, Chen Xiangjiu, Qu Songqiao, Sun Xiweng.</p>
<p>▲Women's 200m Breaststroke Preliminary The women's 200m breaststroke preliminary was divided into two groups. The top spot in both groups was taken by the Yang sisters from Hong Kong, which was quite remarkable. The time for the Hong Kong's Yang Xiuhuan was better in both groups. In the final, the Hong Kong women have a chance of taking all four top spots.</p>

Currently, Hong Kong has 19 points, while</p>
<p>Guangdong only has 3 points. Of the three events remaining, aside from the relay, Yang Xiuqiong of Hong Kong can take all of them, so Hong Kong's victory is already guaranteed.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 18th) President Wang hosted a banquet for all athletes and officials of the All-China Games at 8:00 PM on the 18th and personally received them.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th, President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei addressed all the athletes at the basketball court on the evening of the 18th. Ladies and gentlemen of the All-China Games Organizing Committee, athletes, the All-China Games has achieved unprecedented success since its opening on National Day, thanks to the tireless efforts of all of you. This is not only a source of immense gratitude and consolation for those of you who have participated, but also a source of joy and excitement for people all over the country when they hear this news. What the All-China Games has demonstrated is, first, progress, and second, widespread participation. The efforts of the athletes have resulted in performances that are close to the Far Eastern records and have broken national records. This proves that no matter what, as long as we work hard, we can make progress. If we continue to work hard from now on, then breaking the Far Eastern and world records in the next All-China Games will not be impossible. This kind of effort and proof of progress gives us immense gratitude and consolation. The enthusiastic participation of the masses in this All-China Games, and the large number of spectators, is an unexpected honor for everyone. This undoubtedly gives a profound impression to the general public, stimulating a strong interest and enthusiasm for sports. We can believe that after this Games, the development of sports will be more widespread among the national population. This is another thing that gives us immense gratitude and consolation. The expressions of this All-China Games are one of progress and one of widespread participation. What I sincerely pray for you is that you will continue to seek progress and continue to seek widespread participation. Every athlete should strive for progress at all times, encouraging each other to seek progress, and should also at all times set an example, guiding the national population to work together for progress. To transform weakness into strength depends on this. The meaning of sports is not limited to physical training but also lies in mental training. Every athlete, in terms of private morality, should pay attention to physical and mental cleanliness, and all bad habits should be eliminated. Otherwise, the qualification of an athlete cannot be maintained for long. In terms of public morality, all actions should be collectivized and disciplined. Otherwise, being disorganized and chaotic will inevitably lead to bravery in private matters and cowardice in public battles. The above are all basic conditions for refining the spirit. As for physical training, striving to be at the end of the Shanghai baseball team.</p>

Zhang Boling, President of the National Physical Education Association, and Shen Siliang, the main organizer, have had informal discussions with leaders from various parties. Some people advocate that track and field athletes should be selected first, and reside in Beijing for central affairs, so that they can study and practice at the Central University sports field for a long time, so that academic studies and achievements can be taken care of at the same time. John Ma advocates that the selected athletes from various places should be responsible for assigning management and guidance personnel in various places, and practice by themselves, which would be more perfect.</p>

<p>(Reuters, San Francisco, 17th) World tennis queen Mrs. Maddy declared today that she has decided to return to the world tennis stage. The lady said, "I will strive to win by competing in tennis championships." Regarding her physical health, the lady said that she has gradually recovered and can walk as usual, but it will still take time to return to her former championship form. She has decided to participate in competitions again next year and will start by practicing swimming, which is currently her only form of exercise because swimming does not strain her legs, as her legs cannot bear to stand for extended periods anymore.</p>
<p>At the same time, the lady denied any contact regarding becoming a professional tennis player, but she has rejected a film request, saying that she is very satisfied with her life these past months and does not need it.</p>
<p>The lady withdrew from the final of the Linshan All-American Women's Tennis Tournament this year against Miss Jie Gubai, which caused a lot of speculation. However, it has now been confirmed that it was due to her physical inability to continue the competition.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Wonderful Tennis Performance: Lin Baohua Unexpectedly Overwhelms Xu Chengji <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>▲ Result: 3-1 Victory</p>
<p>Lin Baohua: : : Superb skills, a lifetime masterpiece</p>
<p>Xu Chengji: : : Exhausted and unable to fulfill his wishes</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) There were no men's or women's tennis matches on the 18th. There were few people on the tennis court, but a wonderful performance began in this quiet atmosphere. Therefore, at the beginning of the battle, there were only a few spectators, only a hundred or so people. After two sets were over, the news spread like wildfire, and the audience flocked in, filling every seat, no less than the Xu-Qiu battle on the 17th morning. People were surprised to learn that Lin had won two sets in a row, and some even disbelieved it.</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Cause and Effect of Victory and Defeat <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Objectively speaking, Lin's performance that day was particularly good. His serve was as heavy as a cannonball, his shots were as fast as arrows leaving the bow, and his volleys were unpredictable, all of which could defeat the enemy. Moreover, he was quick in running and effective in saving the ball, and his mistakes were extremely rare. This was the reason for Lin's victory and Lin's masterpiece in his life. Xu, on the other hand, was somewhat arrogant and careless because he had defeated Qiu Feihai in the morning of the 17th. This was the biggest reason for his failure in this match. As a result, his performance was greatly reduced, and he was completely different from Xu Chengji on the 17th morning.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Showing Supernatural Power and Winning Two Sets in a Row <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the first set, Lin gathered his courage and attacked vigorously, while Xu found it difficult to parry and eventually suffered defeat. Lin then won the first set with a score of 6-1. In the second set, Lin took advantage of his victory and won four games in a row, while Xu was at a loss and only won the fifth and seventh games. As a result, Lin won again with a score of 6-2.</p>

<p>However, Xu was by no means weak. After losing two sets, he had to be careful and cautious. From the third set onwards, Xu launched attacks and returned the favor, also winning four games in a row, while Lin only won the fifth and seventh games, just like the previous set. Xu pulled back one set with a score of 6-2.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Trying to Save the Situation but Unable to Do So <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The fourth set was the key to victory or defeat, but Xu's serve in the first game was immediately taken advantage of. Although he tried his best to resist afterwards, he was rarely effective. He wanted to save the situation, but things did not go as he wished. Moreover, because he was too eager to win, he made frequent mistakes. In the end, Lin won the fourth set again with a score of 6-4. In total, Lin won with a score of 3-1.</p>

<p>▲ All Student Rosters, Certificates, and Other Documents</p>
<p>▲ Must Be Submitted to the Bureau by the 21st of This Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education previously received an order from the Ministry of Education stating that the Shanghai Second College of the private Wengong College had been ordered to close, and that the students enrolled should undergo screening tests conducted by the bureau in October. The examination regulations, subjects, and student resume forms were checked and transferred to the college, ordering it to prepare a student roster within one week of receiving the document, along with student resume forms, admission qualification certificates, and photos, and submit them to the bureau. Now that the deadline has passed, they have not yet been submitted. The Bureau of Education yesterday issued a reminder, requiring them to be submitted to the Bureau before October 21st to arrange the examinations on schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e219">New Initiatives of the Shenbao News Correspondence School <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Shenbao News Correspondence School last month, the school has made major internal adjustments. All new student enrollment was originally scheduled to begin classes on October 1st. The lecture notes for the second session of old students could also continue to be issued. However, due to the addition of professors and separate negotiations, it inevitably took time, which prevented the school from starting on schedule. It is heard that all the school's lecture notes have now been printed and will be sent out in batches in the next few days. In addition, the tuition fees for the third session of students recruited by the school last time have not yet been paid in full because they are scattered all over the country. Moreover, in the students' letters, some requested deferred payment because they could not afford the tuition fees at the moment. Considering the students' difficulties, the school has approved a few days' grace period, and those who pay late will also be assigned to the next class. Furthermore, after this reorganization, the school issues as many as sixteen types of lecture notes, and even the elective courses are issued up to six types. As for the homework, they are all personally marked by the original professors of the lecture notes. A monthly exam is held once a month in accordance with the regulations to arouse students' interest in research. The lecture notes are sent out four times a month, that is, once a week, with about 100,000 words each time, and it is planned to send them continuously without interruption. Therefore, students can obtain more than one million words of lecture notes at the end of the year. In addition to studying during the study period, students can also use these volumes for permanent reference. The school's continued recruitment of the third session of new students will close soon. Those who are interested in journalism can quickly register for admission, and those who have already received the test questions should submit them as soon as possible to complete the admission procedures and achieve their study goals as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Who is Willing to Be an Enemy of National Goods? <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>—Yang 𦰃</p>
<p>Nowadays, most modern women and fashionable students only favor foreign goods in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Some say that if this continues, these women will be no less than enemies of national goods. How painful is this statement! Chinese women are all citizens of the Republic of China and receive corresponding education. Who does not love their country? Everyone already knows that the country should be loved, and people should know to use and believe in national goods. Who is willing to be an enemy of national goods? The reason why national goods are not universally enjoyed by the Chinese people should be attributed to both sides:</p>
<p>First, from the consumer's perspective:</p>
<p>(1) Break the Vanity: Most men and women who grew up in Shanghai are influenced and cultivated by the novelty of imported goods, believing that the most elegant and luxurious thing to use is imported goods, so much so that they cannot boast to relatives and neighbors without it. This is completely poisoned by vanity. In fact, the most glorious and honorable thing is to use domestically produced goods. The British queen wears Lancashire cotton cloth, and the whole country follows suit, with everyone taking pride in wearing domestic cloth, which is one proof. If everyone can shift this concept and consider using foreign goods to be shameful and using domestic products to be honorable, then the promotion of national goods will be quick to influence.</p>
<p>(2) Should Have a Sacrificial Heart: National goods are still in their infancy today, which cannot be denied. Those who use national goods, if they feel that the quality of national goods is not perfect, may as well improve it gradually. If the price of national goods is high, they may as well sacrifice temporarily. It must be known that the quality of national goods today is different from what it was five years ago, and even more different from what it was ten years ago. If everyone can have the determination to sacrifice and help together, there will be no limit to future progress.</p>
<p>(3) Should Have a Guiding Heart: Why should national goods be promoted? Because national goods still need to be improved. Therefore, when we use national goods, if we feel that there is something unsatisfactory, we should not have a disgusted heart, but a guiding heart. Where should we imitate, where should we improve, which points should be promoted, which points should be reformed, so that things will improve day by day, and the products will have the hope of being refined. In Japan, a public association must stipulate an improvement fee in a certain industry, which is used to reward the industry for improving products or for testing purposes. If our people can have this ambition, whenever they go to a national goods company or a factory to purchase supplies, if they feel that there is something that should be improved, they may as well propose it on the spot and provide guidance in many ways. I know that national goods manufacturers are fighting for national goods, and they will naturally be happy to adopt it.</p>
<p>Second, from the producer's perspective:</p>
<p>(1) Eliminate Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Get Rich: Not only modern women and fashionable students are the enemies of national goods, but also national goods merchants who take advantage of the opportunity to get rich. There are often some unpatriotic merchants who take advantage of the popularity of national goods to raise prices and seek only profit, which discourages those who are enthusiastic about using national goods. This is no less than destroying national goods. The national goods industry must not have this mentality.</p>
<p>(2) Do Not Produce Poorly: The credibility of national goods lies entirely in the quality and durability of the products. If you have a fluke mind, produce poorly, and seek temporary gain, and consider deceiving people as a good plan, this suicide policy should be eliminated immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Do Not Disguise: There are many opportunities to make money in society. Why bother to violate your conscience and engage in this unspeakable trick. Obviously, it is a Japanese product, but the trademark is changed to falsely claim that it is a domestic product. Obviously, it is an imported product, but it is secretly disguised and falsely claimed to be self-made. As a result, even those who love to use national goods are fooled and become suspicious, losing their belief in loving national goods. This is just enough to create opportunities for dumping foreign goods. This is no less than an enemy of national goods, and their crimes cannot be enumerated.</p>
<p>Who is willing to be an enemy of national goods? It is hoped that both production and sales will work together to establish a new life for the future of national goods.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Please Teachers to Take Responsibility for Promoting National Goods <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>We transfer the words "Ten Years of Lessons" said by King Goujian of Yue to teachers all over the country. I feel most painful about one thing, which is that many young men and women have become loyal comrades in promoting imported goods. My friend, who is in charge of a school in a certain place, often tells me that middle school students and college students in recent years are very enthusiastic about national affairs. However, on the contrary, they all use foreign goods as their daily needs. Almost one day cannot be without foreign goods to decorate their bodies. Especially those women who shout slogans, from head to toe, all succumb to the power of foreign goods. Therefore, many people with a calm attitude often laugh at young men and women for having contradictory toys. But then again, this is not the sin of young men and women. It is the teachers who guide the youth and take responsibility for education who cannot escape the blame. Because young people are influenced and assimilated by society, they tend to like foreign goods. Being a teacher is not just responsible for teaching, and other things can be ignored. Of course, in addition to teaching, all the morbid weaknesses of young people should be corrected and guided. Whether in the classroom or after class, use sincere words and attitudes to make students who value foreign goods suddenly change their personality and become a young person who uses national goods. I think this effect is greater than any responsibility. The impact is also faster. Especially female teachers in girls' schools, take the lead in using national goods and use loyal words to persuade students who like to use foreign goods, so that her cold ashes suddenly become hot. Foreign goods lose people's purchase, and even if they are not resisted, they will disappear. Otherwise, not buying a certain product and changing to a certain product is just replacing violence with violence. What is the use? Dear teachers all over the country, do a propaganda work. If it combines the ten years of lessons of the King of Yue, and continues like this, after ten years, foreign goods will be eradicated. I can make an oath: "Whoever kills me to thank the people of the country."</p>
<h3 id="e224">"Autumn Big Bargain" and National Goods <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Yu</p>
<p>The shadow of the autumn wind, the banners of "Autumn Big Bargain" on various roads, have begun to flutter. All the dazzling advertisements have also exerted their power and touched our eyes, as if telling us that "Autumn" has arrived, because with the change of climate, people's lives will undergo a major change, and if you want to prepare early - add objects, then the major shopping malls and shops are waiting for you.</p>
<p>Naturally, discounts are the only tool to attract customers to buy, and at the same time, it is also the best opportunity to establish a good social reputation. At this time, our national goods factories' sales agencies, national goods companies, national goods shopping malls, and self-operated stores everywhere, in order to respond to the times, must also follow them to hold a grand discount. However, here, we must have a deep view. We must know that the so-called "discount" of general ordinary stores now is continuous and commonplace. This kind of act that only owns a false name and has no practical actions, is nothing more than using this nominal appeal to absorb general purchasing power and take advantage of the time to move. The shallowness of his views, the fragmentary nature and the inability to last, are also self-evident. Then, if we take this policy to make our national goods agency's position to be biased, it is naturally wrong, however, because our discounts must at least contain the following two important meanings:</p>
<p>1. Take the opportunity to gain trust in society: This can now be discussed only in the Shanghai area. There are indeed many sales agencies for national goods, but those who sell foreign goods have not disappeared. So when this discount is held at the same time, we should be how to faithfully sacrifice, and strive for genuine goods at a fair price. Be realistic, and have an amazing performance, so that all sectors of society will be more credible.</p>
<p>2. Take the opportunity to introduce new products: This is to take advantage of this opportunity to introduce the latest new products from various factories to the public for awareness and adoption, just like the China National Goods Company's discount this time, and try to introduce Meiya's silk crepe and butterfly wool, etc. In the large window, it is very conspicuously displayed, and his sales standard will eventually expand gradually from small to large.</p>
<p>In short, we must take "promotion" and "promotion" as the premise, and hold discounts with meaningful and valuable plans. If we have a long-term vision, the current sacrifice will be the future effect. The two are absolutely proportional. Try to think, assuming that every Chinese loves to use national goods and foreign goods disappear, are we still afraid that national goods have no market at that time!</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e225">Discussion on Several Important Issues in Promoting National Goods <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>National Goods - National Goods - Calling Broken Eardrums - Dazzling Eyes - This is the New Contribution of the National Goods Year - This is the First Time in History -</p>
<p>We only need to pay attention to the newspaper, and we can see the news about national goods, as well as the big discounts from various companies and merchants promoting national goods - especially the National Goods Exhibition, which is opened in time, which is worth commemorating! Now, I would like to buy its one-sided foolishness to discuss several questions, which should not be closed to the door!</p>
<p>1. Promoting national goods should expand the scope: - Whenever major companies and major merchants have big discounts, the sacrificed goods are often limited to this city; in this way, people in this city can get the moon first near the water, and people in other cities have to drool for three feet, and want to buy but cannot, so expanding the scope is the first important issue.</p>
<p>2. Transactions in other cities should be given a grace period: - Other cities</p>
<p>It is too far from this city, or places where transportation is not available, and the good opportunity is lost. Although the postmark is used as proof, it is not a thorough</p>
<p>Good way, to make the benefits of this city and other cities equal, unless the time is extended, it is convenient for the slowly arrived other city</p>
<p>3. Mailed goods should take care of credit: - The only agency for purchasing goods in other cities is the post office for transmission. However, when buying goods in person, there is still a mixture of fakes, and mail orders are even more unimaginable. For the sake of being realistic and taking care of credit, it should be genuine goods at fair prices, without deceiving the distant and near.</p>
<p>The wholesale and retail prices should be uniform: - The Chinese business community has never paid attention to business ethics, selling empty and buying empty, relying on it as the only ability, and the prices are also not uniform. Unless you are a person in the know, you can buy cheap goods. The old men in the countryside will suffer, so a uniform price is also worth discussing.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned are the most important issues in promoting national goods, small words, which are related to the future of national goods, big words, which are related to the lifeline of the country. Now, although the rural areas have gone bankrupt, it has reached the point where the mountains and rivers are exhausted, but there are still many畸形phenomena in society: (1) no purchasing power, (2) there is purchasing power but no place to buy. The result is that the people and national goods have little to do with each other. This is not that the people in the mainland have no relationship with national goods, but it is just that they cannot get into the door.</p>
<p>National Goods Speech</p>
<h3 id="e226">邰 in the Public Tea Garden <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Shuangqiu Bo Shu</p>
<p>Today, the decoration in the public tea garden has been completely changed. The tables all around the walls are full of local products such as cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cocoons, and grains, all of which are packed in glass boxes. There are twice as many people, and everyone is looking at those local products one after another. Later, a middle-aged man in a short blue cloth shirt walked onto the stage, stating that he was a member of a very enthusiastic local product movement, and many people opened their mouths and said, "Is this Dr. Tai Shuangqiu?" "Is Dr. Tai so enthusiastic about the local product movement?" So, I unconsciously left the three words Dr. Tai in my brain. He opened his mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Fellow compatriots, I know you are enlightened people, and everyone has recognized the value of the local product movement, but seeing the clothes on your bodies, the cigarettes in your hands,::: I can't help but shed tears for you! Alas, because you love to use foreign goods, 400 million taels of gold are put into the pockets of foreigners. On average, each of us Chinese has to send more than one yuan to foreigners every year. Why? Do you want to learn to be beautiful? Alas, for the sake of your beauty, you have to send 400 million taels to people every year. This is so painful! Compatriots, I used to wear suits and learn to be beautiful, but five years ago, I had long deeply realized that China would soon be destroyed by foreign economic aggression, and I had to get up to wake up our drunken compatriots - look, my blue cloth shirt, isn't it considered clothes? Must you wear a suit and foreign fabrics to be considered beautiful? To be fashionable? Alas, fellow compatriots, do you still want to be beautiful? Still want to be fashionable? Which one is enlightened, quickly make an ambition to adopt local products to the death, please come up and shake hands with me now." So I followed them to the stage, and when Dr. Tai's hand touched my hand, I suddenly felt the enthusiasm of his entire local product movement impacting my body, as if giving me a very severe punishment. I couldn't help but shed tears with them.</p>
<p>National Goods History</p>
<h3 id="e227">The National Goods Cosmetics Industry in the Past Year (II) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Zhongting</p>
<p>(3) Cosmetics, in a broad sense, include toothpaste, tooth powder, scented soap, cologne, hair tonic, face powder, puff powder, snow powder, etc.</p>
<p>Recently, various factories have made progress in terms of materials, except for perfumes that have no special achievements. As for hair creams and other greasy agents, they have been eliminated due to changes in customs.</p>
<p>Also, the center of gravity of our country's cosmetics industry can be said to be concentrated in Shanghai. The Kwong Sang Hong and Sincere factories in Hong Kong have also set up factories in Shanghai. Tianjin and Beiping are second. In terms of business, the products of the factories in Tianjin and Ping are mostly sold in North China due to geographical relations. The products of the factories in Hong Kong and Guangdong are mostly sold in South China and various ports in Nanyang. The transactions are also wide. The products of the factories in Shanghai are popular all over the country and in places where overseas Chinese live. Since</p>
<p>After September 18th, the Northeast market, which had been competing with the Japanese for many years, had no room to intervene. This is an economic loss in addition to the loss of territory.</p>
<p>. It is not the time for the Chinese to care about it. As for the Xiangya Company, due to unsuccessful operations, it has been reorganized repeatedly. Fortunately, it is still able to maintain. Unexpectedly, in the January 28th Incident, the Xiangya factory in Zhabei was reduced to ashes. Whether it can be revived is uncertain. This is the misfortune of cosmetics. In short, after the Northeast Incident, the transactions showed a sluggish appearance. After the signing of the armistice agreement in the Shanghai War in May last year, there was a slight activity for a while. However, it turned back in an instant. The reason is due to the depression of the social economy, and the stagnation of sales in Nanyang (see details below) is also a major blow.</p>
<p>Cosmetics factories also use their equipment and the convenience of materials to engage in sideline businesses. For example, China Chemical Industry Society has mosquito incense, condiments, insecticide powder, and fruit dew. Family Industry Society has mosquito incense, alcohol, and orange juice. Yonghe Industrial Company has ink, mosquito repellent, rubber products, and insecticide. These are all good phenomena of chemical industry development.</p>
<p>Cosmetics pay attention to decoration. The labels, paper boxes, and tin boxes used are all made domestically. The high-quality glass bottles are often taken from foreign countries. Now, almost all of them are contracted by domestic material factories. The products are no different from foreign goods. According to statistics, many rights and interests can be recovered every year. The rise of industry often has a linked effect. Industrialists should know what to learn from to enrich the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Big A-Fu and Foreign Dolls</p>
<p>Round, powdered faces, painted with two dots of rouge; square foreheads, combed with a few strands of bangs: a constantly smiling face, resembling the Maitreya Buddha. This is the clay figure produced in Huishan, the well-known Big A-Fu.</p>
<p>When Big A-Fu arrived at little Ling’s home, little Ling loved it very much. She opened her small mouth to sing for it; clapped her small hands to dance for it; whatever cakes or snacks she had, she would give it to eat first; and at night, she would sleep with it. Big A-Fu also loved little Ling, facing her silently, just grinning.</p>
<p>A month later, Big A-Fu encountered misfortune in its fate palace. Little Ling washed its face, and the rouge and powder were gone, turning into a mud-spotted face. Little Ling accidentally dropped it, and it shattered into pieces. Little Ling cried and wailed, and her mother found a foreign doll from the West to be its companion.</p>
<p>The foreign doll was truly beautiful, with golden hair, an apple-like face, a delicate body, and fashionable clothes, attracting little Ling to love it even more. She sang, danced, fed it snacks, and slept with it, dedicating all the love she had for Big A-Fu to the foreign doll. "One only sees the new person smile, who hears the old person cry?" The foreign doll was smug, and Big A-Fu shed tears in the corner. One day, the foreign doll got caught in the rain and was soaked all over. Little Ling roasted it by the fire to dry its clothes and warm its body. Little Ling continued to roast it. With a "sizzle," the foreign doll turned into a fire child, and the scent of resin and rosin filled the room. Little Ling cried loudly, realizing that her two small hands had been burned into red, swollen blisters.</p>
<p>The foreign doll harmed little Ling, making her cry while eating and cry while sleeping. She resented it for burning her two small hands and feet, and she was sick for a month.</p>
<p>When little Ling recovered, Big A-Fu came again. She said, "I love you, and I hope everyone loves you. You are a symbol of harmony and won't stab people in the back. I never want to see the face of that harmful foreign doll again."</p>
<p>Big Pancake and Fried Dough Sticks</p>
<p>Waking up in the morning, I walk around the fields. The sky is clear, the earth is silent, and a fresh morning air rushes into my nostrils, refreshing my internal organs like sweet dew.</p>
<p>My stomach is slightly hungry, and the freshly baked pancakes and freshly fried dough sticks make my mouth water. I spent nine copper coins on two pancakes and a fried dough stick, chewing and swallowing, tasting crispy, salty, and sweet, all at once, and shouting, "Wonderful! Wonderful!"</p>
<p>In Shanghai, I also chew on bread every day, even cream bread made with American flour. It's neither sweet nor salty, neither sour nor savory, how can it have the human touch of big pancakes and fried dough sticks? Those who like it sweet add jam; those who like it salty spread it with white lard or sandwich it with ham slices. The taste is still better, but one meal of bread is already worth the price of a feast.</p>
<p>Big pancakes and fried dough sticks seem to be exclusive to the proletariat; the rich disdain to bite into them. In fact, they are rich in nutrients, surpassing bird's nest and white fungus. —Whether bird's nest and white fungus are nourishing is still a question in new medicine.—Those who are used to eating bird's nest and white fungus certainly won't chew on big pancakes and fried dough sticks; those who are used to biting on Western bread also won't chew on big pancakes and fried dough sticks, so big pancakes and fried dough sticks are also carrying out their civilian work.</p>
<p>But I still like them after all, and I also advise people to bite into them. At this moment, a gust of wind brings a burst of singing. I wonder if it's students singing or workers singing? The lyrics go:</p>
<p>"Big pancakes and fried dough sticks, big pancakes and fried dough sticks, crispy fried dough twists, three copper coins for one, so delicious! So delicious!"</p>

<p>China Chemical Industrial Society 22nd Anniversary Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e229">Demands to the Government from the Perspective of Supporting National Products <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zufan</p>
<p>Ever since the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people have been alarmed by the severity of foreign economic aggression and the decline of traditional domestic handicrafts. People with lofty ideals have risen up to jointly promote national products in an active manner to save themselves. However, for more than ten years, not only has there been a lack of significant results, but also, upon inspecting the customs trade registers, imports have increased year after year! This phenomenon is partly due to the fact that the organization of our national product industry is not comprehensive enough, the steps are not consistent enough, resulting in divergent views and weak strength. However, the failure of the government to effectively implement protective policies is a major obstacle to the development of national product industries.</p>
<p>After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, all policies were based on the Three Principles of the People, with the principle of promoting production and improving people's livelihood. It clearly proclaimed to our people: First, "Support agriculture and industry," and second, "Save the country through industry." These words are well said. The national product industrial and commercial circles are in an environment of groaning and suffering every day, leading the way and waiting for our government to provide relief and support. However, after four years of political tutelage, the disorder of politics remains the same, the decline of people's livelihood remains the same, so that the dumping of foreign goods and the decline of national products also remain the same. Upon investigation, the biggest reason is that the government has failed to provide the people with effective assistance. The development of a country's industry and commerce is always causally related to politics. Those European and American countries with developed industry and commerce all list the government's efforts to seek social economic stability and development as the top priority in their political program. Matters concerning supporting agriculture, industry and commerce are mostly enshrined in the constitution, special regulations are enacted, taxes are reduced and sales are promoted, and capital is used to promote their success. Everything that can benefit industry and commerce is pursued with full force. As a result, industry and commerce become more developed, the social economy becomes more prosperous, and the country's politics also become stable. On the other hand, in our country, foreign aggression and internal strife are intensifying day by day. Exorbitant taxes and levies make it difficult for people to survive. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for our national product industrial and commercial circles to seek outward development!</p>
<p>Recently, our government, in view of the increasingly acute world economic competition, deeply knows that without promoting national products, it is not enough to save the country from danger. It has specifically designated this year as the Year of National Products, and with political power, it has awakened the people to cooperate fully, hoping to open up a new path in this sluggish state. Observing the enthusiasm of recent exhibitions in various places, we are sincerely gratified and have more enthusiastic expectations for the promotion of national products.</p>
<p>However, we still have unavoidable pain that must be stated to our government. Now, please briefly state them: (1) The import tax should be urgently revised. The economic community has called for the dismantling of tariff barriers, and as a result, the barriers of various countries have been raised. Our government once revised the tax rate in May of this year; however, the tax rates on most imported goods have not been changed, so that the national products that have just sprouted are competing with the products of foreign factories with decades of large capital and low tax imports. Is the outcome still waiting to be revealed? Isn't it to maintain this status quo? I have seen that the import tax rate on raw materials for a factory is often higher than the import tax rate on finished products. This is truly contrary to encouraging industry. This is why the import tax rate must be urgently rectified.</p>
<p>(2) The 2.5% surtax should be abolished urgently. In addition to the 5% ad valorem tax, our country's current customs duties must also add a 2.5% surtax. The implementation of the 2.5% surtax began in 1927. The implementation of this tax was originally intended to serve as a fund for the 2.5% national treasury bonds. The initial issuance of 2.5% national treasury bonds in 1927 was 30 million yuan, and another 40 million yuan was issued in 1928. Its purpose was designated to be used for military expenditure, political expenses, and insufficient budgets, and to repay short-term loans, with the end of April 1933 as the final period for repaying principal and interest. Now that the repayment period has expired, the collection of the 2.5% surtax has no reason to exist in fact. Today, our country's industry and commerce are declining, how can we bear to pay the surtax in addition to the regular tax? If it is said that the national military and political expenses are insufficient, then since customs duties are already autonomous, the import tax should be increased to supplement them. Does our government truly intend to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants and alleviate the suffering of the people? Please start by abolishing the 2.5% surtax.</p>
<p>(3) All exorbitant taxes should be effectively stopped. Since the New Year's Day of 1932, our government has implemented the declaration of customs autonomy and at the same time abolished likin and all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. It has not hesitated to issue repeated orders to exempt machine-made national products from heavy levies; however, because our country's politics are not on track, warlords occupy and enrich themselves, and the central government's authority cannot reach the remote provinces. Therefore, the clear orders are equivalent to empty words, and heavy levies remain the same. For example, from Shanghai to Sichuan, Gansu, and other places, the transportation taxes and other expenses often exceed twice the value of the goods themselves. How can we seek the promotion of national products under such circumstances? If our government wants to support the development of industry and commerce, it should quickly and effectively stop this heavy levy so that national products can be sold throughout the interior; otherwise, if the promotion is biased towards the cities and foreign goods are sold in remote areas, the hope of revitalizing national products may end up being a pie in the sky.</p>
<p>(4) We should actively devote ourselves to transportation construction. Since the establishment of the five yuan, the facilities in all administrative aspects have gradually seen progress. Even in terms of transportation, in addition to the Ministry of Communications, a separate Ministry of Railways has been specially established to take charge of its responsibilities. Its intention to facilitate industrial and commercial transportation is undoubtedly far-reaching. However, due to incessant internal strife and foreign aggression over the years, most of the country's tax revenue has been consumed by military preparations. As a result, transportation construction has become slow. Even in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, which are known as the construction of Meng Jin, the various sections of the highway have been completed one after another, but their benefits only extend to travelers. As for freight transportation, it is still rarely effective. The situation in other transportation-blocked areas is even worse. If our government wants to relieve the plight of industry and commerce, it should quickly and actively rectify transportation to facilitate the transportation of the people. After all, transportation and exorbitant taxes are always in a positive ratio. If transportation can be convenient, the exorbitant taxes in the interior will lose their basis and will be easier to abolish.</p>
<p>The above three points are just a brief summary of the major issues that are closely related to our interests. Other issues, such as the development of industrial raw materials and the training of technical personnel, also rely on our government's practical planning to seek fundamental solutions. Now that political tutelage is about to be completed and constitutional government is about to begin, the outline for supporting agriculture, industry, and commerce has been seen in the draft constitution, and we sincerely hope that it will be passed and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e230">How to Promote National Products <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Shu</p>
<p>In China, a country with backward production, the production volume and consumption volume of our country's industrial products form a ratio of two to five, while at the same time, material progress is advancing by leaps and bounds. The needs of the people for industrial products can be imagined from this.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this Year of Promoting National Products, we want to solve the fundamental method of promoting national products. The best way is for major factories across the country to unite their operations, because the benefits of united operations are:</p>
<p>(1) Restricting production volume,</p>
<p>(2) Estimating standard prices,</p>
<p>(3) Concentrating talent and distributing sales,</p>
<p>(4) Implementing comprehensive planning,</p>
<p>(5) Avoiding unnecessary competition, resulting in mutual harm,</p>
<p>(6) Concretely seeking production and sales cooperation.</p>
<p>In short, our country must unite the strength of the entire industrial sector to seek a balance between production and sales volume. Mr. Fang Yexian of the China Chemical Industrial Society is actively carrying out this work, based on this purpose. For example, the launch of the China National Products Company is based on this ideal and realized. It is expected that in the near future, there will be a new development in the entire national product sector.</p>
<h3 id="e231">The Issue of Agricultural-Industrial Cooperation <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Mars</p>
<p>In modern Chinese society with backward production, I believe that the problem that needs to be solved urgently is agricultural-industrial cooperation, because in fact it has told us that the raw materials for industrial products mostly depend on the countryside, and yet in recent years our rural economy has been experiencing panic every day. Therefore, the industrial sector cannot have improved development. So from now on, if we want to increase the production volume of national products, we must cooperate with farmers in a down-to-earth manner. Now I will cite two examples below:</p>
<p>For example, the raw material for manufacturing insecticides is pyrethrum, but the cultivation of pyrethrum has not yet been popularized in the current domestic agriculture. Seeing that the domestic demand for insecticide raw materials is not meeting the supply every year, we have no choice but to rely on foreign pyrethrum. If we had considerable cultivation in our rural areas, then the annual harvest would be sufficient for our own use, and the agricultural-industrial problem would be adequately solved at the same time.</p>
<p>Another example is that the raw material for manufacturing seasonings is made from wheat beans, and the production of wheat beans requires the efforts of farmers to supply the needs of our national product factories.</p>
<p>China Chemical Industrial Society, on the one hand, is manufacturing new industrial products, and on the other hand, is also actively promoting agricultural products, such as promoting the planting of pyrethrum and directly signing cooperation agreements with farmers, which is a very good example. I hope that our entire agricultural sector will rise up and cooperate with us to complete that greatest wish.</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Contribution of Samsung Caramel Coloring in Industry <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Sheng</p>
<p>Since the flourishing of science, the industries of various countries have had a trend of rapid progress. Various daily necessities in life, especially, are changing with each passing day. Those old industries that do not conform to scientific principles have almost all been eliminated invisibly! Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, with a large number of factories, but unfortunately, the Chinese people only know how to stick to old methods and do not think about improvement, so it has become a country with backward production and suffers from the pain of foreign economic aggression! Generally, people with insight have long been aware of this and unanimously believe that "improving industry and increasing production" is not enough to save the country from danger! China Chemical Industrial Society was founded in the first year of the Republic, with the aim of improving industry, specializing in the use of chemical methods to manufacture various new industrial products. The products it has launched have been praised by the society. Recently, the company, in view of the unhygienic, uneconomical, and inconvenient nature of traditional sugar frying, has used chemical methods to research and manufacture "Samsung Brand New Caramel Coloring." Now, after the trial use of major soy sauce gardens, bean curd workshops, etc. across the country, they have unanimously found it satisfactory.</p>
<p>Samsung Brand Caramel Coloring is manufactured by chemical methods using machines. Its raw material is glucose made from wheat flour, and then the caramel coloring is made from glucose. It is steamed to extreme concentration, the material is pure, and the color is deep and clear. Compared with the old method of frying sugar, its effect has at least the following advantages:</p>
<p>(1) With the same effect, it can reduce costs by half, allowing manufacturers to reduce the cost of their products.</p>
<p>(2) The quality is pure and clean, without the drawbacks of dregs and turbidity.</p>
<p>(3) It is odorless, tasteless, does not ferment, and does not mold.</p>
<p>(4) It only needs to be dissolved in boiling water before it can be used, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>(5) The color depth has standards, and it can be used in the right amount, without the disadvantages of being too much or not enough!</p>
<p>(6) The quality is excellent, no less than Japanese goods, and the price is cheaper, which is enough to resist foreign goods.</p>
<p>In short, this new type of caramel is a new product in our country's industry. In practice, it dares to claim the four characters "high quality and low price." However, this new industrial product has not been on the market for long, and its sales have not yet become widespread. It is hoped that manufacturers in various places will adopt it for comparison and promote it unanimously, saving consumption in manufacturing, increasing cleanliness in food, and saving a part of the country's economic leakage.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Studying Artificial Beauty Methods Based on Skin Tissue <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Huaipu</p>
<p>—Results Obtained from Domestic Cosmetics—</p>
<p>The color of the skin is due to the different amounts of pigment particles in the skin cells and within the cells, which distinguishes the various races of people. Even within the same race, people are divided into those with less pigment who have yellow skin and those with more pigment who have black skin. Therefore, we do not have to admire the beauty of the white race. Before there is a way to change the pigment, yellow people have to have yellow skin to the end, and black people have to have black skin. If we see a yellow person's skin that does not come into contact with sunlight or a patient's deathly white skin, the degree of whiteness may be more severe than that of white people's skin, but we cannot say that it is whiter than the beauty of white people. This is as ridiculous as the analogy of Madam Meng's white snow and white feathers.</p>
<p>When it comes to the beauty of the skin, it will never be emphasized solely on whiteness or blackness. Only when the skin is smooth and shiny can it be considered beautiful and healthy. The meaning of what we usually call skin is really very narrow. In physiology books, it is only a part of the whole skin tissue, only the outermost stratum corneum of the skin, and the several types of tissues below the stratum corneum are ignored. Even if we want the stratum corneum, which we call skin, to be smooth and shiny, we should understand the most relevant sebum.</p>
<p>The components of sebum under a microscope are countless small particles, a small number of glandular cells filled with fat, cell membranes that have changed, and cholesterol crystals. The chemical composition is mainly liquid lipid oil and solid soft fat, and others are composed of fat soap, a small amount of cholesterol, protein, and inorganic salts. Because this sebum contains the secretion of oil, it moisturizes the skin (stratum corneum) and makes the hair smooth: Sebum constantly performs metabolic functions, pushing the stratum corneum and dead and damaged skin tissue cells on the skin surface outward. Therefore, we find many skin flakes falling off our body, and the skin also feels oily and greasy excretions.</p>
<p>The reason we pay attention to skin beauty is certainly not because beauty can please people. Moreover, the amount of oxygen absorbed and the amount of carbon dioxide excreted by the human body through the skin in a day and night is almost equal to the amount inhaled and exhaled by the lungs. Naturally, we should pay attention to it. Now that we understand the general effect of skin tissue and sebum, and there is a reason why we have to pay attention to it, but human beings always want to realize the method of making the skin white and beautiful. Since the pigment cannot be transformed, they have to imagine artificial whitening methods. Many internal and external medicines that can whiten the skin have been listed, but very few can truly comfort those who crave permanent beauty methods. They have to take another step back and imagine temporary makeup methods, and then they conduct partial research from domestic cosmetic manufacturers. As a result, there are various products produced by the China Chemical Industrial Society that can be used by ladies in society every day, guaranteeing safety without side effects, and will definitely have the effect of transforming ugliness into beauty and achieving the reality of beauty.</p>
<p>1. Peony Scented Soap: There are many methods for distinguishing scented soap, and the best is to not contain free alkali. However, it is not suitable to contain impure saponified fat, and it is not a good product to contain many insoluble substances. Now, all kinds of soap produced by the China Chemical Industrial Society do not have this kind of problem. Especially the new product, Peony Scented Soap, is even more refined. The surface does not show white spots, which is evidence that there is no free alkali. If you cut it off and press it on white paper and look at it in the sunlight, you will not see oil stains, which is evidence that there is no impure saponified fat: If you test it under concentrated alcohol and there is no insoluble precipitate, it is evidence that it does not contain insoluble substances.</p>
<p>2. Fangze Cream: This is another product that is most beneficial to the skin. It is a pure fatty substance. We know that the skin can absorb all gases, but it can also absorb continuously adhering liquids and fatty substances. Therefore, this kind of fat can be absorbed and reach inside the sebum to increase its secretion function. Therefore, it is most suitable for daily application between dry and chapped skin in winter and those who lack sebum, as well as for washing the skin with pancreatic soap and after men shave.</p>
<p>3. Swan Powder: The easiest thing to cause skin disease in scented powder is to contain lead, even if it is a small amount, it can make the skin rough and produce many pimples after prolonged use. In severe cases, black-brown spots will appear on the skin. When lead poisoning spreads throughout the body, it can cause the body to lose weight, reduce appetite, and emit a foul odor from the mouth, because this kind of lead white powder contains non-soluble substances such as aluminum oxide and aluminum carbonate, but when it combines with sweat and fat, it becomes soluble and is very dangerous to pass through the skin and then immerse in the blood! This Swan Powder is indeed made of non-toxic magnesium carbonate and non-irritating spices, and is rich in fat, light in texture, and does not block pores.</p>
<p>4. Era Cream: It can not only make the skin expand and soften, resist the invasion of wind and sun, but also absorb the dirt that is prepared to be excreted in the pores, and increase the secretion function of cells, so that new cells can live in good condition, and the cells that have withered and died can be smoothly squeezed out in the metabolic state.</p>
<p>With these four exquisite cosmetics, used in conjunction with each other, it can be guaranteed that the skin will absolutely not be damaged, and the purpose of beauty can be achieved, so it is specially presented to the public.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Postscript to the Pyrethrum Cultivation Method <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Huaipu</p>
<p>Recently, the fourth edition of the Pyrethrum Cultivation Method, edited and written by the China Chemical Industrial Society, was written by Mr. Yu Chengru and reviewed by me. This kind of academic text does not need to be embellished. After proofreading it several times, I was fortunate enough to read the contents first and learn the planting methods, and my feelings were gathered together, and I really had to express them all.</p>
<p>The discovery of the function of pyrethrum was as far back as 430 years ago. After repeated dissemination, the planters are now all over the continents of Europe, Asia, and North America. The production volume should be the largest in the United States and Japan, followed by various European countries. However, when I was writing and wanting to review this book, I consulted Chinese and foreign classics extensively, but I could not find a detailed and systematic description that could be used for reference, roughly like this book. Therefore, the originality of this book is really commendable, and it is even more valuable that it is entirely based on more than ten years of planting experience and compiled, without incorporating empty theories.</p>
<p>The enterprise that increased its business by planting pyrethrum and adopted it as raw material in the country also started with the China Chemical Industrial Society's manufacturing of mosquito coils. I remember that since the establishment of the farm in 1917, it has accumulated more than 200 acres of land, with a perfect scale and an annual increase in production. I still remember that this year, it invited people from all walks of life who were interested in planting pyrethrum to visit the Anlangdu Experimental Farm. The scene was lively and prosperous. As a result of years of promotion, people from all walks of life have gained a deep impression.</p>
<p>According to the pyrethrum, the seedlings produced from seeds are better. Therefore, supplying seeds is also an urgent need. Therefore, the China Chemical Industrial Society must distribute a large amount of pyrethrum seeds to comrades every year, with the true purpose of promoting them, setting the lowest price. For example, this year's harvest of more than 80 kilograms of seeds was sold out in less than ten days, and letters ordering from various places were still coming in, so it had to purchase dozens of pounds from other farms at a high price, and at the expense of sacrifice, it still transferred them at the original price of 50 cents per market ounce, which is much different from the market price of 80 cents, more than one yuan, or even three yuan. Moreover, because the seed selection is precise, the seedlings that have been cultivated in various places have already achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>In recent years, the rural economy has been in crisis, and the lives of farmers have been difficult. The various crops they plant have suffered from poor harvests, and the capital invested in fertilizer, labor, and planting is difficult to recover. However, planting pyrethrum is easy and the income is even better. Usually, the net income per acre per year is 37 yuan. If you can cultivate it yourself, the income can be increased. If you carry out crop rotation, the income will be even greater. It is truly the only way to save the rural economy. It not only supplies the domestic chemical industry for production and consumption, but also recovers some vested interests!</p>

<h3 id="e235">Righteousness and Profit <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Mr. Tang Weizhi gave a lecture on Mencius at the Suzhou National Studies Society, saying that the seven chapters of Mencius were simply about the distinction between righteousness and profit. He also lamented that in recent times, there is a situation of "both superiors and inferiors contending for profit." He spoke very thoroughly, not like the commentaries on the Thirteen Classics, explaining the classics with the classics, leaving people confused and ultimately at a loss.</p>
<p>In my opinion, today's China is much better than the China Mencius saw. And those kings, those officials, those scholars and common people, are also much more admirable. Just look at the speeches published in the newspapers, which one of them isn't thinking about plans for the welfare of the country and the people? They don't talk about benefiting the country or the family, but about benefiting the people. The word "country" is too abstract, while the word "people" is so practical. As for the talk of competing with the people for profit, it only circulates in their stomachs, and they never dare to let it slip out of their mouths. This is also the result of more than two thousand years of traditional cultivation.</p>
<p>Although the rights and obligations are listed equally in the provisional constitution, we only hear people shouting about "outflow of rights and interests," and wanting to "recover rights and interests." They are afraid that people will not compete for profit. Looking at it from another perspective, there used to be righteous servants, righteous maids, righteous thieves, and righteous beggars in the notes, and even dogs of different races also had righteousness. Could it be that they have all been eliminated along with the eight-legged essays and queues? Or perhaps they are unwilling to see the development of such distorted private virtues again? Therefore, newspapers that record everything they hear have discarded these things into the wastepaper basket.</p>
<p>I am not advocating for martial arts novels. Indeed, seeing all kinds of injustices in society, and feeling full of strange anger, I can only vent it through them. When we open the newspaper, aside from the masked performers on the world stage and the disorganized magic show on the national stage, it is all photography of lewdness and theft. Especially in the descriptions of men and women, they never compromise on a single word, and never relax on a single sentence. In their view, is this benefiting themselves and benefiting others?</p>
<p>"The beauty already belongs to the Shali, and there are no righteous warriors like the ancient escorts." Just cross out six words, and it can accurately describe the modern era. It is "The beauty belongs to profit, and there are no righteous warriors." As for the interpretation of beauty, it is certainly not in the narrow sense.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Women <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>Originally, since we are "people," we naturally speak human words, eat human food, fulfill human obligations, and enjoy human rights. Everything is done to truly "be a person." Then, as human beings, we do what we do as human beings, not what someone orders us to do. Where is there room for someone to give us those appellations that deviate from "human," shaking our position as "people"? Yet there are clever and selfish people who, just because of that slight difference in physiology, painstakingly come up with a "woman" to put above "people," to distinguish and describe a kind of mystery. At the same time, there are really brainless people who actually accept it. Thus, an invisible shackle is placed on them, and people live and compete in this shackle forever. Just look: in the past, they competed to be virtuous women, chaste women... now they have transformed into social butterflies, queens... there are also those who are half-awakened, rushing to pursue women's rights, women's movements... How pitiful! They—in fact, they are them—are the ones in shackles. Thinking that since they are "women," they naturally only do what women do, and don't ask about anything else. In other words, they only know that they are "women," and never know that they are "people."</p>
<p>Is this the crime of women? The fact is indeed displayed before our eyes. In the midst of national crisis: the clothes on their bodies, the powder on their faces, and the dazzling decorations, the enchanting perfumes, which one of them is not an imported product, a high-priced imported product? They spend their days dancing, watching plays, eating fancy food, riding in cars, especially sensual. They take away people's money, consume people's energy. They... Such extravagance and lewdness undoubtedly make them the object of ridicule, the target of blame, and the source of sighs for gentlemen. Moreover, in the face of national crisis, one cannot help but think that the occurrence of the national crisis, the inability to save the national crisis, is mostly due to their extravagance and lewdness. However, however, is this really their crime? The society of private property has long treated them as private property, as commodities, suppressing them, intimidating them, and tempting them, causing them to lose their instinctive resistance and become obedient. At the same time, they are made into toys for the upper classes. Is this also their crime? Alas! The social system squeezes them into all kinds of slaves. How pitiful! Being squeezed into slaves, and still having the crime added to their heads, is even more pitiful!</p>

<p>Ibsen said, "The most rational person in the world is the most isolated person." From this sentence, we can know the importance of power to personal relationships! An athlete who can maintain a record that others cannot break, a great writer who can be admired by readers all over the world, is this not clear evidence of the supremacy of power?</p>
<p>If you doubt power because "a weak person can kill a strong person with a pistol. A mentally exhausted person can suddenly feel energetic after smoking two puffs of opium," then you must pay attention to the fact that the weak person and the strong person both don't have a pistol, and that smoking opium is self-destructive.</p>
<p>Friends, develop and train your own power! Develop and train your correct power!</p>

<p>Recently, I have often been troubled by various kinds of expectations: such as expecting rain in my hometown, but my hometown stubbornly refuses to rain; expecting friends to keep their promises, but friends stubbornly refuse to keep their promises, and so on.</p>
<p>Life is originally in the midst of expectations, but the value of expectations lies in being able to fulfill them. If it is always expectations, then it is no different from dreams! Comparing the two, perhaps dreams are even better, because dreams are short-lived, while expectations take a lot of time, and the result is only disappointment and disillusionment.</p>
<p>Seeing that the sky is not raining, it is better to prepare for artificial irrigation methods as soon as possible. As for friends who do not keep their promises, it is better not to invite them at all. This will save a lot of trouble!</p>
<p>Empty expectations are of no help to reality.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Misunderstanding <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Thorough understanding is necessary, but misunderstandings often occur between people.</p>
<p>"Misunderstanding and laziness are probably more harmful than fraud and evil." Goethe once said this. He also said: "To be misunderstood is originally the fate of us human beings"! Yes, misunderstanding is unfortunate. In our lives, we often misunderstand others, and we are often misunderstood by others. From these misunderstandings, various mistakes are sometimes inevitably made. In fact, there are many, many things in the world that are misunderstood, such as an ideology that is considered progressive by A, but considered reactionary by B!</p>
<p>Everyone has their own position, and misunderstanding is due to incompleteness. If you don't want to misunderstand, you must thoroughly explore. If you can't thoroughly explore, then misunderstanding is inevitable. This is my conclusion about misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Mao Dun and "Spring Silkworms" <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Jingru</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Mao Dun is the most diligent one in the current literary world.</p>
<p>He not only produces more than other writers,</p>
<p>but also has more substance in his works than other writers. We rarely see a careless novel from him, even a chapter, a section, and a sentence are always carefully planned, arranged, and structured.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Mr. Mao Dun has abandoned the recollections of the May Fourth era and focused on exposing and guiding the society that is currently in darkness. This is clearly reflected in his works during this period. "Spring Silkworms" can be regarded as a representative work of this kind.</p>
<p>In "Spring Silkworms," Mr. Mao Dun's realistic skills are unexpected. The story takes place in a village in central Jiangsu or near Zhejiang. He not only writes about the local customs and human feelings in this area so that people feel as if they are there, but also describes the individual personalities of two generations of people in the countryside very realistically. In addition, the suffering that the current society inflicts on the villagers is also cried out between the lines without any exaggeration. This is something that other new literary writers who use rural reality as their subject matter cannot match.</p>
<p>Now, this story has been adopted by the Star Film Company and adapted and produced into a movie. And the director is Mr. Cheng Bugao, who is unique in his realistic skills. I think "Spring Silkworms" will inevitably become the most successful realistic film today.</p>
<p>The new literary world and the film world have successfully joined hands. We look forward to the emergence of new literary works on the screen following "Spring Silkworms," and a closer integration of literature and film!</p>

<p>Tian Qing said, "Why not gamble? If I think of this place, I don't want to do anything else, I just want to fight a battle and vent this anger. Winning or losing, life or death, it doesn't matter at all." Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "You are just blindly rushing. How much ability does a company commander like me have? Even if I take a company of people out to fight a battle, what can I do? Unless our division commander is like you, wanting such a face, maybe we can make a little difference." Tian Qing had not yet replied when the quartermaster of his company rushed over and said that the clerk in the grocery store and the shopkeeper in the coal store were waiting for a reply to their requests for money. He shrugged his shoulders and laughed, "Did you hear that? If I leave, these creditors will get anxious again." After speaking, he turned and left. After walking more than ten steps, he quickly ran back and laughed at Zhao Ziqiang, "I just talked nonsense and forgot all the important things. Are you going to Haidian today?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "I know, you want me to bring you a registered letter." Tian Qing laughed and said, "When are you going?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "Don't expect me to delay things. You should send someone to Haidian." Tian Qing laughed and said, "You don't know, I have a little difficulty here. That follower is always sending letters for me, almost every three days a registered letter. I am a little embarrassed to let him know." Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "You can rest assured. You have helped me, and I must also help you. If I have time to go home, I must ask my old man to go to Miss Huang's house and tell them that we can't get away. Then, Miss Huang will be able to understand you." Tian Qing stood opposite him, as if he had a lot to say, but after thinking about it, he didn't say anything, just sighed and turned around and left. Zhao Ziqiang looked at his situation and thought to himself, "Seeing this situation, Tian Qing's sadness is probably no less than mine. Me, him, and Guan Yaowu, the situations of the three of us are somewhat different." (216)</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>One week ago, one night, the weather was so hot and stuffy that I simply couldn't close my eyes unless I forced myself to sleep with sleeping pills. Later, I really couldn't stand it, so I quietly got out of bed, turned on the light, washed my face with cold water, wiped my body, and pulled out a copy of the "Novel Monthly" from a pile of old books and lay on the rattan chair, flipping through it aimlessly.</p>
<p>Reading under the incandescent light seemed even hotter. Sweat was streaming down non-stop, and the clothes on my body were as wet as if I had just climbed out of a swimming pool. I had to move the rattan chair to the window,</p>
<p>turned off the light, lay on it, constantly waving a fan, and stared out the window with wide eyes.</p>
<p>The night was quiet, and there was no sound. The moon was hanging in the sky, already missing a corner. There were no clouds. Stars were sparsely scattered on the blue sky. Occasionally, a gust of wind came, but it was hot; blowing on the body, it might blow out a burst of sweat.</p>
<p>What a beautiful moonlit night this is. It's a pity it's hot!</p>
<p>I was thinking wildly. My thoughts were like a horse that had broken free of its reins, not knowing where it had wandered off to. What I was actually thinking about, I don't know. I only know that I was thinking wildly. The moon, the stars, the clouds, the wind, the sun, the rain, the snow, the tragic changes in my family, the education expenses for my two children in the future, my wife's frequent illnesses, the Japanese occupation of the four northeastern provinces, the fight between my black cat and the yellow cat that lived with me, it seemed that I thought about everything, it seemed that everything had passed through my mind.</p>
<p>But, I was still hot, and sweat was still streaming down. I also felt more irritable.</p>
<p>The clock next door struck twice.</p>
<p>"Aooo... Aooo..." It sounded neither like a sheep bleating nor like a wolf howling. "Ah, a ghost is howling"!</p>
<p>I jumped straight up from the rattan chair. The hairs on my body all stood on end. A cold sweat drove away the stuffiness.</p>
<p>"Aooo... Aooo... Slut, do you want to see? I'm not wearing pants! Haha, haha! Aooo... Aooo..."</p>
<p>I realized that this was a person speaking, so I breathed a sigh of relief. My whole body also "lifted martial law." I gradually started to feel hot again.</p>
<p>But, why did he have to "Aooo..."?</p>
<p>"Aooo... Little brother-in-law, haha, little brother-in-law, little turtle, I admit defeat in front of you! Let's settle the score in the next life. Evil will be punished, little turtle, listen, don't be so ruthless! Aooo..."</p>
<p>The sound was coming from across the street. I stood at the window and looked across the street. But I didn't see a single person. This guy was "Aooo..."ing more and more vigorously, and the sound was becoming more and more miserable. I couldn't bear to listen. But, I was still driven by curiosity, so I still stood there looking across the street, quietly listening to this miserable sound.</p>
<p>I had lived here for more than three months, and I had never heard such a sound before. Maybe this guy often "Aooo..."s randomly, but I can't say for sure; however, I haven't had the chance to hear it. Borrowing the moonlight, I glanced at my wife on the bed and felt that women at home had nothing to do, and loved to gossip about other people's business, and that my wife must know about this matter. I thought about waking up my wife and asking her who was shouting like this in the middle of the night, and why no one was interfering. I walked to the bed and, looking at my wife's smiling face in her deep sleep, I didn't want to wake her up after her recent illness. I planned to ask her tomorrow. So I went back to the window, lay on the rattan chair, and listened to this sound that aroused my inexplicable sadness. I kept listening until the sky had already turned fish-belly white, and then I vaguely fell asleep amidst the miserable sound.</p>
<p>When I woke up the next morning, it was already 8:45. I hurriedly wiped my face and went to the company to work. I forgot to ask my wife about what happened last night. When I got to the company, I was ordered to go to a branch company in another city to investigate a matter, and when I came back three days later, I just forgot about it. Today, after eating dinner, I was pulled to the entrance by Beibei (my five-year-old daughter) to cool off. There were many people in the alley. I was listening to them talking about gambling with great interest when suddenly the back door of the house across the street opened, and a man jumped out from inside. He was wearing a rimless straw hat on his head, a small vest on his upper body, and dragging a pair of broken shoes on his bare feet, but, ah, he was not wearing pants!</p>

After the morning, buying suddenly surged, but the traders failed to agree and purchased gold bars one after another. There was an extremely strong supply of gold in the market from Yuan Mao Yong You, but it was sold and re-entered by the Guangdong group, and the rising wind spread, once approaching the $20 mark, but still fell slightly at noon.

The combined standard gold price was 834.78 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 17 yuan higher than the previous close.

<p>The financial sector's collection activity has been lively for several days. Due to the settlement of October transactions, the inflow and outflow of funds appears more complicated than usual. Foreign banks are experiencing congestion with foreign exchange and goods, making the situation more hectic than for Chinese banks. Money shops, due to long-term consolidation, are also handling more foreign public document collections than in the past. The market price for foreign exchange discounts remains low due to an oversupply of forwards, with no hope of rising. Yesterday, both morning and afternoon sessions were at six cents. 'Hua Tou' (a type of transaction) traded at slightly two or three cents. The turnover for banknotes in the morning session was over 5.1 million, with new transactions at over 700,000. The afternoon session saw transactions exceeding 500,000, and the Small General Association recorded over 400,000. Bank collection reports show that foreign banks collected 2.67 million in note payments, over 3.2 million in silver dollars, 5.23 million in various goods and foreign exchange collateral, and over 5.89 million in silver dollars, with special collections totaling over 2.7 million and withdrawals of 800,000 silver dollars and 1 million in foreign currency. Chinese banks collected 3.78 million in note payments, over 3.8 million in special collections of foreign currency, and 6.78 million in various network remittances, taxes, and other collections.

Furthermore, the total exchange volume at the Clearing House on the 18th was 6,955,634.29 silver dollars, including 3,229,279.07 in silver dollars and 3,726,355.22 in silver dollar transfers.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Securities: Bull and Bear Confrontation, Bond Market Lingering <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange showed a slight fluctuation. Bears attempted to suppress prices to make them small, while bulls wanted to pull them up to make them big. Both sides competed, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a balanced situation. However, with the October futures delivery approaching, their respective strengths will soon be evident. Yesterday's trend showed limited trading by major players. Noteworthy was the heavy selling of Gold #33 at the morning close, while #4 surprisingly bought 400,000 at once. Otherwise, the amounts were generally insignificant. Buying focused on #4, #41, and #50, while selling focused on #6, #12, #33, and #47. Trading was generally not very active. The opening in the morning was slightly better by two or three jiao, but the trend was not very strong. #33 continued to be sold. The forward market remained relatively stable. Unified Salt Tax turned slightly lower by one or two jiao due to competition, gradually showing a lingering trend. At the afternoon opening, #6 and #11 were both sold, while #4 and #41 were bought at the same time. However, the emergence of numerous retail bulls caused the market price to fall uniformly by two or three jiao. Closing transactions were quieter, with market prices stable and firm. The result was a uniform rebound of a small five fen to three or four jiao. The total established volume was 7.79 million yuan. Spot trading was not initiated. The total futures volume for Unified Salt Tax was 3.59 million, Disbandment Bonds 695,000, 1920 Customs Bonds 625,000, 20-Roll 20-Customs Bonds 1.5 million, and Gold Short 1.9 million, with the remaining ranging from 100,000 to 3-500,000.</p>

<p>The yarn market is sluggish, with the situation gradually stabilizing. After the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Council, speculators generally watched and waited. With numerous rumors circulating that the Council would buy on dips and sell on rallies, new players lacked market initiative, leading to a bleak situation. Considering the current situation, a long period of consolidation is likely.</p>

<p>The opening of the human contract labor market in the morning maintained its upward trend due to the rebound in American cotton, but new buyers were few. All months fell by three or four jiao, with distant months rising by three jiao. The afternoon market remained quiet, with each month slightly falling by one or two jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 39,500 bales.

<p>The cotton market is quite strong due to a rebound in American cotton of 50 points per pound. Buyers are holding onto October contracts quite firmly, and selling by bears has not been enthusiastic, leading to a firm market situation. However, the supply from various sources is gradually increasing, while factory purchases remain sluggish. The market sentiment for futures cotton is extremely firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month presented a favorable outlook. With quotations for foreign wheat rebounding by 1.67 yuan in Chicago and rising by about 9 jiao in Canada, sentiment was stimulated immediately upon opening. Furthermore, activity was seen from the client side, with the Shandong gang showing strong appetite for futures. Speculative bulls in the market were also very active, causing the situation for each month to leap forward step by step. The highest for the current month rebounded to 2.085 yuan, 2.1 yuan for November, and the forward months also improved simultaneously, with rebounds of seven or eight fen compared to the previous day's lowest price. However, after the afternoon opening, the market was initially stable, but after rising, buying interest waned and some manufacturers slightly offered resistance, causing the market sentiment to return to quiet. Observing future steps, the key to ups and downs ultimately lies in the extent of foreign dumping. As a result, the current month improved by 2.25 fen compared to the previous day, November by 1.75 fen, December by 2.5 fen, January by 1.5 fen, February by 0.75 fen, and March by 1.5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the situation for each month was generally in a stable state with slight signs of consolidation. With quotations for foreign wheat rebounding by 1.67 yuan in Chicago and rising by 9 jiao in Canada, sentiment seemed slightly better upon opening. However, after this severe shock, buyers both inside and outside the industry inevitably had some concerns. Thus, although the situation was good in each session, the extent of the rise was insignificant. Observing the future prospects, although foreign wheat quotations are now at around 4 jiao, the temporary improvement may be followed by a sell-off due to exchange rate changes. As a result, the current month improved by 2 fen compared to the previous month, November by 2 fen, December and January by 3 fen, February by 2 fen, and March by 3 fen. Spot wheat trading, which had been quiet for many days, opened barely yesterday, with prices falling by about 2 jiao. It is heard that 1,000 bags of Jiangbei wheat were purchased by Fuxin at 3.68 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Hakka Xian Rice Sales Acceptable in Fujian, Stalled in Guangdong <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sporadic arrivals of Hakka Xian rice continued. Sales remained strong in Fuzhou, but appetite in Quanzhou had waned. There were no inquiries from the local market or Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces. The market had softened, and there were concerns about sellers seeking to liquidate small quantities. Sentiment and the market were unstable. Mid-grade Hakka Xian rice fell slightly by about one jiao. However, due to genuine demand in Fujian and Guangdong, the hope of smooth sales could be triggered by slightly lower Hakka Xian prices. Therefore, there is no fear of a sharp drop in future market prices. Yesterday, 75 bags of Hunan 米, 309 bags of unpolished rice, 361 bags of Anqing milled rice, and 900 bags of Nanjing milled rice, and 196 bags of unpolished rice were sold to Fuzhou. 371 bags of Wuhu milled rice were sold to Quanzhou. Prices were all slightly lower by one jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Broken Indica Rice Continues Slight Decline <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Supply is near the 40s, and the market situation seems to have turned around, but sales are not smooth, and the situation is still difficult to tighten. Therefore, the new Indica rice from each gang has improved slightly. New Du Jian has rebounded by a jiao due to scarcity and fragrant flavor. New Yang Jian remains stable. Although 6-700 bags of purchases continue indoors, other purchases have also been adopted. However, as the purchasing capacity is still tight, it is difficult to increase prices. As for red rice and white rice, price fluctuations are only a few fen. However, broken Indica rice from each gang has softened due to the relatively large number of arrivals and the lack of broad sales channels, and prices have been further reduced. New Yin Yuan remains unchanged. Xiang Geng, which has been out of stock for a long time, opened quite well, with prices at 8.7 yuan. (Shanghai North) Arrivals from various riversides are in the 30s, and sales are quite good. The market conditions have tightened for broken rice, new rice, white rice, Yuan rice, and 埠 rice. Yang Du and Yang prices are strong at one jiao. The prices of kiln-dried 陈 rice and 百哥 rice are slightly above one jiao. Yin Yuan and 客 Jian rice remain weak.</p>

<p>(London Dry White Silk Prices Plunge) Yesterday, according to reliable news from the Jardine Matheson silk building, Grade A Tussah Raw White Silk was priced at only 8 shillings per pound, equivalent to only 741 yuan in Chinese currency. Grade B was 7 shillings and 6 pence, equivalent to only 690 yuan.</p>
<p>(Chinese Silk Transport to England Already at the End of the Line) Yesterday, the British Postal Ship "Montoya" only carried 135 pieces of yellow and white silk for Jardine Matheson, Taihe, and Kechang, including only 30 pieces of factory-dried raw silk, bound for England. The remaining 105 pieces of yellow and white coarse silk were transferred to Bombay from England.</p>
<p>(Foreign Firm Silk Sales Lifeless) With overseas silk prices continuing to fall, silk sales in Shanghai are lifeless. European and American firms, seeing that overseas silk telegrams are not turning around, dare not risk buying from Chinese silk merchants, who have increasing stocks. Although they are willing to lower prices and sell at a loss, they lack buyers. The market is sluggish. Yesterday, only Ren Ji imported 10 bales of white factory silk, and 开利 et al. imported 16 bales of yellow factory silk, with prices still weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market at foreign firms in the local port was relatively quiet. Each European firm still wanted to replenish more Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei Gong Xi and other items, or issue tele sales, but since the bottom has not much, the attitude of Chinese merchants is even more firm than before. Therefore, yesterday only Gong Xi and Zhen Mei transactions were made. The situation is turning quiet. For a trial sale, the top grade Gong Xi from a well-known Tunxi brand has already risen to 97 yuan. Zhen Mei opened at 71 yuan, Zhen Mei from Wuyuan East Road, and opened at 126 yuan, all slightly firmer than before.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market had no significant fluctuations, and the trend was flat. The Association's settlement price for No. 24 coarse white granulated sugar remained at 21.55 yuan, without any changes. No. 20 medium white granulated sugar was slightly up by 5 fen, at 20.8 yuan. Dutch Red NT brand was settled at 16.61 yuan, slightly lower than before. Taikoo Sugar B brand was down 5 fen, settled at 21.55 yuan. Chunghwa Kwok Wah fine white top grade was 20.5 yuan, first grade 20.3 yuan. Zhenji First Grade 20.3 yuan, and grades 2-5 were reduced by 2 jiao per grade. Chaozhou green sugar dealers were slightly active due to the rise in land prices, with over 300 bags opened for sale. Gao Huanggang green was 15.7 yuan, followed by 15.05 yuan, 15 yuan, 14.9 yuan, and the lowest at 14.2 yuan. Shen Yu opened for sale 500 pieces of sheet green at 12.2 yuan. The local factory also had some openings for crystal green at 16.2 yuan.</p>

<p>First crop orchid seeds are scarce, and top quality goods have reached 35 yuan. It is now known that second and third crop goods have also arrived. The weather is clear and sunny during this time of autumn, so the quality of the goods is quite good. The style has already arrived at the firm yesterday. Not only is the yellow exceptionally bright, but the fragrance is also fragrant, and the body is dry. Those in need should purchase in a timely manner to avoid falling behind.</p>

<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw Zhecun Jun asking people to read Zhuangzi and Wenxuan, and I wanted to say a few words. Yesterday, I saw Feng Zhiyu Jun's article, and besides feeling that Shi Jun was indeed a bit "oversensitive," I also had some doubts about his words.</p>
<p>High school students' "vocabulary" is too small, we quite acknowledge this. However, Shi Jun saw high school students' articles and had this experience. I have also seen high school students' articles (this has nothing to do with my resume), and my opinion is not as general as Shi Jun's. There are two aspects to looking at the small vocabulary of high school students (I have this, and it is not limited to high school students): one is that they use few words, and the other is that they read few words. Usually, the words we use are certainly fewer than the words we know. Shi Jun likes to use old vocabulary, but we dare not say that Shi Jun's vocabulary is only the words he uses. High school students' small vocabulary is not necessarily because they know few words, but because their age and experience are limited, and they cannot yet use the words they know. I myself have had this experience when writing English compositions. Knowing many words does not necessarily mean that you will use them. This is my opinion of Shi Jun.</p>
<p>Even if high school students' small vocabulary is due to knowing few words, it is quite questionable whether Wenxuan and Zhuangzi can increase their vocabulary. It is also questionable how many of the words in these two books are currently usable. We sometimes feel that Shi Jun's occasional use of words from mountain and sea fu in his novels is difficult. We recognize more vocabulary sometimes for reading ancient books, and sometimes for knowledge, and we do not necessarily have to show it in articles. Although word usage and literacy are "related," they are not the same thing.</p>
<p>Can Zhuangzi and Wenxuan really enable people to understand the method of writing articles? This may be true for some people. But I am doubtful. Mr. Yu Dafu said that Chinese new literature is inherited from the world literature system. Even Shi Jun's novels and poems may be using foreign methods, right? Or perhaps Shi Jun is "oversensitive" and has unique insights, but one person's opinion may not enable others to obtain the same. I believe that current articles are gradually adopting foreign methods more and more. Naturally, our ancestors have also left us quite a bit. I feel that asking high school students to read Wenxuan and Zhuangzi to learn article writing methods and increase their vocabulary is an effort that yields little result. If someone actually believes Shi Jun's words and reads Wenxuan and Zhuangzi, and is going to learn article writing methods and increase their vocabulary, what results will Shi Jun think of once they apply it?</p>
<p>"Without the cultivation of classical literature, Lu Xun Jiesheng's new articles would never have been written as well as they are now." Why can't many scholars of Chinese classical studies write new articles? This is a question of whether thinking and concepts are mature. If thinking and concepts are mature, and there is enough vocabulary, articles can definitely be written. Otherwise, reading ten Zhuangzis is useless. Currently, there are many people who write articles very well, and I know that they have nothing to do with Zhuangzi and Wenxuan. Instead of having high school students spend time reading Zhuangzi and Wenxuan, looking up dictionaries, and learning article writing methods, it is better to use this effort to train their thinking and concepts and increase their new knowledge. But I am not against looking up dictionaries and reading classical literature. Although Shi Jun does not want young people to all do classical Chinese, these two classical Chinese works cannot give young people the results that Shi Jun expects.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Notes on "Letters of Zhou Zuoren" <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Huai Qiu</p>
<p>October 6th, Friday. I woke up not too late, before seven o'clock.</p>
<p>I met Xiaolin in the cafeteria and borrowed "Letters of Zhou Zuoren" from him. Reading books for enjoyment—this year marks a great transformation and can be called a great improvement. I started by reading the preface, which I found very appealing, so I took it to the lecture hall – to a lecture by a certain Mr. Yu Xiang – and while Mr. Yu's voice wasn't loud, I focused on the book. Occasionally, I looked up at his eyes, feeling like I exchanged glances with the blackboard once or twice, or only faced Mr. So-and-so from my hometown. Therefore, I didn't feel like I was attracting much attention, making this my first major success reading in the lecture hall. After class, I still couldn't put the book down, even when my stomach was rumbling, until Ming Fei called me to the cafeteria. I closed the book with "letters" on my mind. Pinglin said I was eating too slowly, which was also because I was preoccupied. After the meal, I continued reading, and finished the book in less than half an hour. Then, I rinsed my mouth, closed my eyes, and fell asleep. When I woke up, I felt great. I rinsed my mouth with more hot tea, took a sip or two, and a bee came. I sprayed it with water, and it left, but then came back. So I chased it and sprayed it again. After three or four sprays, the bee lay motionless on the ground, and I went back inside to grind ink and write notes, wanting to discuss Qi Ming's writing. Qi Ming's writing is wonderful. What makes it so wonderful? There are three things: first, I could read it in the lecture hall; second, I didn't notice my stomach rumbling while reading it; and third, I even broke my routine after dinner and read before sleeping. Having one of these qualities would already be quite something, let alone having all three. What is the secret to this wonderfulness? I have an explanation: I say, his writing is fresh in every word and plain in every sentence. This freshness and plainness are very rare these days. Lower-level writers create new things, but there are too many things like "I'm lacking virtue," or "Aki," and even someone with my limited English skills finds it hard to keep up. Of course, I'm not a standard English speaker, and I can't assume that others don't understand just because I don't. Qi Ming's letters certainly have some very new sentences, but they never leave me completely clueless – except for one poem included, which I found quite difficult to understand, but that wasn't written by the old man Qi Ming. Moreover, the recipients he copied were learned scholars like Pingbo, Feiming, and Nan Wuji. I am not as learned, so it's not the copier's fault that I don't understand. The sentences are short, and after being used to reading translations or "originals" with sentences of twenty or thirty words that require a painstaking, word-by-word reading, this feels different. All this is just freshness. Old man Qi Ming doesn't have any doctrines that need to be promoted or any objects that must be praised or overthrown, loved or hated. So, he writes in a plain and simple way, without the so-called risky strokes of a literary master. But I am someone who usually loves to judge people and firmly adhere to right and wrong. So, when I read these letters, I also become calm and feel like looking up at the clouds. This is a great pleasure, and I rarely experience it these days. The old man's life is much better than ours (I boldly use "ours," thinking some of my friends feel the same way). However, when it comes to writing, either there is time but no leisure, or there is leisure but no intention. Writing depends on being "forced" or "repaying debts." Or they keep the "kitten" (this is a sketch that Mr. Qi Ming was planning to write) in their minds for years, letting her meow by the eaves without ever putting her on paper. Then it is excusable that we, this group of poor students who exhaust our minds thinking about life (Note: also about livelihood issues) in the lecture hall, have nothing to write. That explains it completely.</p>

<p>— Liao Bo Tan</p>
<p>In the early autumn dusk, an ancient city is shrouded in a deathly silence.</p>
<p>I wander on a weed-covered square.  As the wind passes, hinting at the coming winter, there come the hoarse cries of those struggling for life, the wild barking of dogs, and the rustling sounds of withered leaves. The breeze, blowing on my body, is a little chilly. "Ah! It's autumn again!" I think.</p>
<p>In the distance, a group of soldiers sit on the grass resting. It's just "my feeling," but we don't laugh, we don't talk, and our faces seem covered by a layer of gloomy mesh.</p>
<p>An old beggar, emitting a mournful sound, tremblingly, weakly, uses all the pitiful adjectives to describe himself, bestowing every noble crown on others, pleading for the charity of every "good person," but the "good people" all hurry past.</p>
<p>I stare blankly at the leaves of a willow tree: it silently sways in the autumn wind.</p>
<p>All of this tightens my heart, tightly, and I walk forward painfully and lazily, like a crow separated from its flock at dusk.</p>
<p>Looking up, over there the electric lights emit a ghastly white light; the wind is stronger, and the passersby are gradually dwindling: : :</p>
<h3 id="e271">Communication from Ganpu (6) <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Dear Friend [Names are obscured]:</p>
<p>What kind of structure is the so-called "salt pond"? In my last letter, I already said that on the vast sandy beach, there are mounds of earth that look like graves. These mounds are the sand that has been filtered for salt and repeatedly dug up from the salt pond as "ash waste." Next to them is the "salt pond." The structure of a salt pond is a rectangular depression dug into the ground, with sides built up with mud. The size of the depression varies, but at the very least, it is about ten feet long and seven or eight feet wide. In the middle of the depth of the salt pond, a row of reeds is densely packed, allowing water to barely flow down. At the same time, on the side, there is a deep wooden bucket embedded in the ground to hold the brine. The size and depth of this bucket vary. The ones I saw were two feet deep and one foot in circumference, with round or square covers of one and a half feet. The bucket mouth is connected to the brine pond, allowing the brine to flow out of the pond and into the bucket.</p>
<p>After the ash is poured into the pond, onto the reeds, the next task is "water carrying." Strong male and female workers carry buckets from the salt pond all the way to the seashore, carrying seawater bucket by bucket and pouring it onto the mud in the pond. This allows the water to carry the salt from the mud down through the reeds and into the large wooden bucket for brine, which becomes "salt brine." The filtered soil is then carried to the side of the pond and piled up. When the work is finished, it is spread back onto the ground, allowing the seawater to spread the salt seeds again. This means waiting for the tide to come. Once the brine condenses, it flows into the bucket, which is called a "salt well." However, the process isn't complete yet. The next step is to measure the thickness and concentration of the brine to see its quality. The measuring tool is called "lotus seed." This "lotus seed" is said to be produced in Ningbo, but it is not the edible kind. They use a small oil ladle, place several lotus seeds in the ladle, and cover the mouth of the ladle with wire mesh. They use a bucket to scoop up brine and place the lotus seeds into it. The degree to which the lotus seeds float indicates the quality of the brine. The bucket for holding the brine is sometimes a porcelain jar; however, next to the salt stove, it is mostly made of wood. If the brine is successful, it can be carried to the salt stove at any time to be burned into salt. If not, the bucket mouth can be sealed with "grass tendons."</p>
<p>Here, it is necessary to explain the construction of the "salt stove." A typical stove is very large, usually occupying the space of three rooms. The so-called pot is usually made of six or eight large flat iron plates pieced together. The gaps are constantly filled with mud tendons to prevent leakage. These plates are hung from iron pillars suspended from the roof pillars to prevent them from falling. Below, the stove is made of earth. The stove is about two feet long and one foot wide. Behind the stove are large brine vats and seawater vats, with small brine buckets above them, close to a bucket that holds a salt pan, directly connected to the pan by a small bamboo tube. When burning, first pour the brine into the brine bucket, allowing it to flow out of the bamboo tube, through a basket at the mouth of the tube (used for purifying), and into the pan. This is how salt is made. It takes about one and a half hours to burn a batch of salt. In between, there are also steps, such as stirring in seawater when it gets too dry, and turning it over with a shovel and spreading it evenly when it is about to dry completely, until it becomes salt. After the salt is burned, or rather, before it is fully burned, it can be taken out. This is called "salt essence," but this is only kept by the salt-making family for themselves to eat or use for rinsing their mouths. Generally, it needs to be fully burned, then shoveled into a basket, carried to the warehouse, and stored, then packed and transported out.</p>
<p>That's how salt is made. Here, I would like to introduce some of the names and terms related to salt-making tools. The scraping knife used for scraping ash is also called a "towing bed." Spreading the scraped ash flat is done with a "ash spreader," and the term for spreading it flat is "dropping ash." Digging out old mud is done with an "iron rake," and it's called "digging up the old." Putting in new ash is called "collecting ash," using a "push rake," "rake head," and "silk carrying pole." Then, there is the work of carrying ash to "fill the trough," using "brine buckets" and "dippers." Below, the work of leveling is called "filling the trough," which is the work of pouring water, using "brine buckets." Two days later, the brine is passed into the well, called "jumping the brine" or "settling the brine." As for the work used when burning salt, it is mostly "Y-shaped shovel," "long fire fork," "salt shovel," "scooping brine" material, "stirring the brine dipper," "material bucket," "adjusting ash shovel," "spreading ash rake," etc. As far as I know, it's mostly like this. I wonder if there are any omissions or errors? August 26th</p>
<h3 id="e272">Two Brothers (2) <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— By Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>The old fisherman inhaled the stench with gusto, as if it were the fragrance of roses, and said:</p>
<p>"Ah! So fresh, these fish!"</p>
<p>Then he continued:</p>
<p>"How many did you catch! You, doctor?"</p>
<p>His eldest son, Pierre, a thirty-year-old man with a black mustache trimmed like a magistrate's, and clean-shaven lips and chin, replied:</p>
<p>"Ah! Not many, only three or four."</p>
<p>The father turned to ask the younger son:</p>
<p>"And you, Jean?"</p>
<p>Jean, a slender young man with golden hair and a full beard, but looking much younger than his brother, smiled and replied softly:</p>
<p>"About the same as Pierre, maybe four or five."</p>
<p>They always told this lie that made old man Roland happy.</p>
<p>He wrapped the fishing line around the oar lock, crossed his arms, and said:</p>
<p>"I'll definitely never fish in the afternoon again. After ten o'clock, that's it. The fish don't bite anymore, they take a nap in the sun."</p>
<p>The honest man looked around at the water with the satisfaction of an owner.</p>
<p>He was previously a jewelry merchant in Paris, who, because he loved sailing and fishing very much, retired from his accounting work as soon as he had some savings and could live frugally off the interest.</p>
<p>He retired to Le Havre, bought a boat, and became an amateur sailor. His two sons, Pierre and Jean, stayed in Paris to continue their studies, sometimes returning during vacations to share the joys of fishing with their father.</p>
<p>After graduating from middle school, the elder one, Pierre, five years older than Jean, felt he had a talent for various professions in succession, tried half a dozen one after another, quickly became bored with each, and immediately threw himself into new hopes.</p>
<p>Finally, medicine piqued his interest, so he studied it with extraordinary enthusiasm, and as a result, after a fairly short period of study, and after obtaining a special dispensation from the Minister of Education to shorten his studies, he recently passed the doctor's examination. He was an ardent, intelligent, volatile, and obstinate man, full of fantasies and philosophical ideas.</p>
<p>Jean was exactly the opposite of his brother: his brother had black hair, he had golden hair; his brother was irritable, he was calm; his brother was resentful, he was very docile. He studied law steadily, and recently, his brother obtained his doctor's diploma, and he also obtained his bachelor of laws degree at the same time.</p>
<p>So, both brothers came home to rest, and, if things went well, both wanted to practice in Le Havre.</p>
<p>But a vague jealousy, a kind of latent jealousy that grew day by day between brothers and sisters, and that was rarely seen until adulthood, only to erupt when one of them married or received an unexpected blessing, made the two wary of each other in a fraternal, harmless intimacy. True, they were both affectionate, but they coveted each other. Pierre, five years older than Jean, looked at the other little creature suddenly appearing in his parents' arms, and being loved and caressed by them in such a way, with the hostility of a spoiled pet.</p>
