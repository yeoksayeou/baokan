<p>時評</p>
<h3>勗前線將士　·濟</h3>
<p>自熱軍不戰退却。使日軍得以長驅直入不旬日而鐵蹄遍於熱省全境。梟張之寇。方且趾高氣揚。自詡此戰之迅速爲開歷史上之新紀錄。但目前則已遭受我國極英勇悲壯之拚死爭鬥。且自承爲陷入艱難之苦鬥矣。</p>
<p>據連日電訊。我宋哲元王以哲孫殿英關麟徵諸部。</p>
<p>都人奮必死之决心。浴血應戰關麟徵師長。旣以親自督戰。負傷五處。宋王孫諸部。傷亡亦極鉅。然而敵愾同讐。視死如歸。肉薄苦鬥。再接再厲。終予强寇以重創。使其不敢正目相看。此次悲壯艱苦之爭鬥。自應並</p>
<p>一二八上海抗日血戰。永耀光輝於我民族之史册而此立於我民族革命爭鬥最前綫之忠勇將士。尤應受我全民族之欽崇愛護頂禮膜拜。</p>
<p>在今日情勢之下。暴敵之來。如狂風疾雨。我民族如不甘願坐待宰割。則此時已根本無退避苟安之餘地。</p>
<p>惟有展開民族革命戰爭之大旗。合全民族作拚死之奮鬥。始能阻遏日帝國主義者之侵略暴行。爭取我民族之生存自由。吾人亦已反復言之。故今日而能立於民族革合命爭鬥之第一線。抗禦日軍之侵略暴行者。吾人即認爲民族之武力。革命之武力。全國人民當一致爲其後盾。反之食人民之食。衣人民之衣。安受人民之供奉。而有土不守。有侮不禦者。吾人即認爲我國家之罪人。悲壯哉我前線之忠勇將士。苦寒塞外。雪地冰天。以窳敗之軍器。當頑强之日冦出生入死。白刃搏鬥。耿耿精忠誠足以動天地泣鬼神。碧血沙場白骨。</p>
<p>荒草。誠足以與日月爭光輝。前缐之忠勇將士旣已造成其不可磨減之光榮矣。我全國之軍隊與民衆。果遂無復聞風興起踐踏死者之血路而前進者乎。</p>
<p>自九一八以後。每一次浴血抗戰。國人即一次致其萬分熱烈之希望。然而不旋踵即失望者。以無人繼其後也。今日民族革命之戰爭。旣已展開。則當前急應以整個之計劃。作整個之行動。换言之。即應動員全民族。準備持久之爭鬭。若仍以局部之抗爭。抵禦暴敵全力之侵襲。一國之中。此處抗爭。彼處旁觀。旣無爭鬭之决心。即無支持之能力。其最足誤事者。即爲苟安之一念。以爲熱河旣失。此後以長城爲天塹。日人當已心满意足。平津庶可稍安。此種心理。恰爲亡我國家之鴆毒。故吾人於勗勵前線忠勇將士之餘。尤切盼我政府與人民下最後抗爭之决心。而毌使此次悲壯之犧牲。又付諸東流。</p>

<h3>陳公博譚話</h3>
<p>中德鋼鐵廠合同或許變更</p>
<p>直接交涉說全係道途猜測</p>
<p>國聞社云、實業部長陳公博、因出席江浙漁業改進會並順便迎候汪精衛、於前日到滬、昨日午後五時、記者晤陳氏於辣斐德路何宅叩以中央種種情形、與談如次　　中德鋼鐵廠陳氏謂中德合辦鋼鐵廠合同、余擬日内發表一篇文字、因内中事務複雜、此時從長談亦未能詳盡、惟大概情形、可約略談談、蓋中德鐵廠合同、原定去年十二月一日可簽字、但今已過去、現在關於該合同今已先簽定一草約、其原合同躭擱原因、非關一事因如雷家溝煤　之整理、從先籌措十萬元、建立五棧、并開一自流井、不但行政煉鐵鑪須繼續整頓、更且須先派員從事測量、其他如江西萍鄉附近高坑地方之小鑛、亦須四個月方能完成、爲一勞永逸計、因元合同躭搁擱未簽、且前擬合同、依後形勢、或有不妥之處、届時仍變更、亦未可知</p>
<p>熱戰之近况陳氏繼謂、熱河戰事詳情、余不明瞭、惟一點爲余所知即喜峯口我軍確屬順利而且日軍死傷損失甚巨、日僞現正在繼續增集大批援軍、彼在朝鮮軍隊、决不致調動、所增者爲僞國附近之日軍、古北口戰事因口外多山嶺、或因接濟與地形上關係、另築防地不過南天門確爲華北要隘、現仍由找軍據險扼守</p>
<p>月底將北上次叩以陳氏前有北上之說、據答、余原擬往熱河一行、嗣以時局緊張、且承德告陷、因此實不願北上、再眼看國土之喪失、於是無形中中止惟待部務稍暇、大約在本月下旬、余仍須前往、因爲　州以南與平津之東北一段、余還想前去看看當地民衆之組織與實業之狀况、究竟辦理得如何也</p>
<p>江浙之漁業江浙兩省漁業改進會、現定明日（即今日）下午在該會所開會、前定計畫實以規模太大、經濟關係、一時難以舉辦、且以前預算、若照計畫完成、總需欵在五百元左右今又舉軍事若是倥偬、更難籌措、不過此事現祗有逐步施行、所謂逐步者、余有三點可告君（一）目前所欲積極整理者、第一爲護洋巡艦、過去巡艦經費、盡由巡艦自收、現在統歸局（管理局）辦凡事欲生利必先消弊、故實部所謂整理者、如日後整理完成一則漁商可減少痛苦、二則在指揮亦甚便利、經費方面、每艦在過去三千元一月已足、至於添造巡艦現春汛已到造亦不及、祗可俟諸本年年底與來年初必有以擴充也（二）爲沿江浙　小埠、設小氣象台以當地氣用無線電報告各處不但可發、而且可收、一面與本埠徐家匯天文台再切實聯絡、如此則江浙漁船、可少遭　遇不測（三）余日内擬與銀行界稍事接洽即設立漁民借貸所事、因江浙一般漁民感於經濟困難、至汛期缺乏資本、竟至無從開出捕魚、偶有向他處借貸、所吃拆息、往往在九分以上、將來俟借貸所設立後、余之預算、祗有一分利息、是亦爲减少漁民痛苦振興漁業之一急務、好在此事輕而易舉、能有二三萬元、即可舉辦以上現均在樍極進行中</p>
<p>必收復失土外交方面、現羅部長（文幹）已北上、外傳種種、盡失事實、甚至有謂、羅氏北上爲直接交涉也實則當羅北上之時、日方非謂將退出國聯乎、故羅北上亦即此、總之、余相信並保證、政府必不出此下策、東省失土人人意爲難歸故主惟余相信可以收復惟如何收復、余以爲軍事則甚難、必須以外交方式、方式維何、余即知亦不便明言、總之、余之想念在兩三個月間收復必無、迅速但至本年底、必有收復失土之一日也</p>
<p>汪精衛晋京汪先生明日可到滬、彼自途中僅來一電、此後即未通訊余因事務叢忙、定明晚即須返京、且因明日下午開會事、故上船往迎與否與明晚來得及返京均未定、汪先生到滬後行止若何、余須與晤面後方知、晋京一事、余之猜想、或屬可能、談至此、遂告辭面别</p>
<h3>兩路撥付借欵</h3>
<p>京滬滬杭甬兩路、自遭上年一二八之變損失甚鉅、營業亦大受影響、致應還中英銀以司到期借欵、未能歸還、自黃局長吳副局長到任以來、以兩路經濟雖極困難惟事關國際債欵信用、認爲應當設法維持、當秉承鐵道部意旨、一方督率所屬竭力開源節流、方在每日營業進欵項下提存的欵、專備撥還債欵之用、數月以來、成效卓著、現已將滬杭甬到期借本一部份撥還、數年前京滬路添購車輛、亦系由中英公司借欵、從未付過分文、亦將第　期應還之數撥付云</p>
<p>中央社云、南京電傅鐵道部將組織一京滬路債務整理委員會、兩路管理局總務處長莫衡、昨日否認此說、據談、京滬路目前並無組織整理債務委員會之必要蓋兩路目前所負之零星債務、總計僅一百五十餘萬元、最近已陸續清償六十餘萬元、尚餘八十餘萬元、如時局平靜、則預計於六個月内、可以完全清償、至於中英銀公司之借欵、尚有一千四百餘萬元最近亦已付過三十餘萬元、局方擬俟零星之債務清償後、即行竹還此項借欵</p>

<h3>窮師範生的出路在那裏</h3>
<p>殷日炎君訊</p>
<p>我有一個問題想費你一些精力和時間來替我解答！我是一個行將畢業的師範生，在這充满着矛盾的社會裏面，畢業後的出路問題，倒犯着異常　重了·在理論上··所謂師範生，應當就其被注入的一些敎育當職，做一個小學敎師去宣敎，是無異議的·可是，在封建的殘餘勢力仍舊維擊着的社會裏，以你這毫無權勢　金錢的　小子，　　有個適當的小畢給你進去服務較爲完備的小學嗎？談不到！省實小嗎？更談不到！因爲那些只有被我們所謂『社會地位』</p>
<p>較高的師範生們，甚至於中與畢業生們，才能領到聘書的·窮小子充其量也不過把你送到一個普通的鄉村小學去，有薪是只有十一二個袁頭，校址是異常偏僻狹隘，並且常常要欠你幾個月的薪水，或者　給你幾張不兌理的欠薪票這樣，你能維持你的最低生活嗎？你能養活你的老婆和兒女嗎？　實如打下『十八層地獄』的絶路！退一步講··卽或你能夠鼓着所謂『犧牲的精神』，不畏凍餒，不畏艱難，硬着頭皮去做，可是，你能味着良心把你所受人家灌輸的似是而非的學　，去麻醉那班充着新生命的兒童，尤其是鄉村中爲將來革命伍的兒童嗎？你能有拍馬的本領夫奉迎那些豪綽地主和敎育行政機關的局長委員嗎？否則，亦　請你下職，回家去抱小孩！總之，這一條所謂一學以致用』的師範生止當出路，是不大亨通的這時，先生或許　問我，你不會升學嗎？可是我在上面已經說明我是窮小子，在　敎育資本貴族化的現社會裏，當然是澄有升學的權利的卽或有一兩個標接着數濟貧寒青年的大學而你的零用和考費又從那裏出？家庭的用又有什麽人替你負擔？並且你　意做　鴉片酒精式的商品，從現社會的大學裏造出來吧？所以莫說我没有錢，卽有錢也不願意進這一流的大學！到了這裏，先生一定又　問我；你卽明瞭在現社會上是無你的出路，何不負起時代的趙阿妹十元、陸澄九二元、陸　芳二元、陸　榮二元、吳張惠英五元、吳萬燕十元、林慧娟一元、孫林月英四元、施瑞生二元、陳悟生五元陳女士二元、浙江實業銀行代收文　公司同人十一元二角、後援　經收　良熾二元、楊式才一元、楊灼一角六分、陳五五角、前含齋三十元、太古四樓伙食部同人十元、安黴高等法院同人陳福民十元、王樹榮六元、葉旭　二元、陳步高也孔憲　張明焜各二元、李朝燮萬志華張廷　沈實　楊仰程徐聲章謝鴻薛蘭如鄭之僑孫希衍翁成球陸念　吳光祖唐省吾高仙披劉恩源徐　柏胡晏清汪淮承熊中楊道基鄒成九歐陽咸姚德鳳李克球王衍曾錢家騮各一元、朱樹霞王國　牧文農白酒封陳祖濤胡雲各五角、總共五十四元七角、義興盛　廠月捐二十一元、邱萃農一百元、吳雪賡五元、蔡杏邵潤青沈澍桂三元朱春實二角、吳藉　一元、顧竟容一元、山秀芳三元、邵潤青張五陵程筱山沈仰之汪國英方俊卿潘羅卿凌洪曁趙有　諸　銑合十一元二角、顧菊如祁伯恊陸振甫汪佩倫合二元、吳藴陸子梅姚爾奎莊文華吳希榮沈　秋汪友濤程浦和姚家聲合一元八角、金伯鴻邵潤青莊良伯蔡轉元王虎臣朱養竹程子　七元、顧綬章金樹動孫志常仲滄石二元五角朱金林邱慶麟趙福海吳偉民程秉鈞葉子久凌伯康朱雄冠合一元六角張愛庭五元、陳内生汪集樂吳夢白孔浩翔吳　如謝松齊八元、沈榖齡　延禧沈柏春張銘之金組庭汪延康蔡詠孫啟瑞合四元五角、程壬生李動甫姚家聲朱守姜曜初戴節明寗子林吳怡實凌聯端盧葵青沈永和程靜海合二元五</p>

<h3>天報告</h3>
<p>徐家匯天文台昨日下午四時三十分氣象預報云山東與黃海東海之上天氣睛寒、有緊峭時令風、來自西北至東北方不等、揚子中游與下游天晴或　有西北風、又昨日下午三時前二十四小時内、本埠氣温、最高五○九、最低三九六去年同日、最高五九○最低三一六</p>
<p>使命來，向社會去奮鬥呢？不過，我又有一點意思要和先生商榷的；現在社會奮鬥的隊伍中眞實的領導者是在那裏？能够眞眞唤起大衆的使命者又是在那裏？我覺得我所接觸的所謂覺悟的許多青年，也不過是些抱愛人·穿西裝賺錢·求利·追各的小資産階級的意誠者做些掛羊頭賣狗肉的勾當，不但不能够去接近大衆領導大衆，並且只知自身享樂，這一類人你能和他們爲伍嗎？和他們同流合污嗎？我是天天要吃飯的，我不能够扎起肚子來負起時代的使命去奮鬥！所以，在陷入這混雜矛盾不可自拔的時候，晚最來謂敎先生，望先生指示我一條出路</p>
<p>答··中國的經濟在國際資本帝國主義的壓榨之下迅速地日趨於破産的情形之下敎育自然是談不到有什麽進展那麽，師範生的命運也就可想而知了初級師範生總是小學的師資，小學敎員的痛痛苦，在各國都不能免，在中國更是一言難盡。譬如上海罷，每個小學敎師，每月至多不過三十元左右的薪金，除了房金伙食所餘已無幾再加上必需的零用·那就十月八九都是拮据異常。若果有老婆孩子的話那只有讓他們喝西北風了，全國的唯一大都巿的上海的小學敎師生活尚且如期斯，内地更是一言難盡，這個問题不是簡單的敎育問題，而是整個的政治問題，整個的社會制度問題。自然我們小學敎師，應當各爲其自身的利益而奮鬥，然而要知道要離開整個的政治問題與社會問題自身問題是不會解决的。肚子固然不能餓着去做負起時代使命的奮門』然而你不做這種奮鬥·依然是要餓肚子，大多數的人要餓肚子。不餓肚子或是没有餓肚子的經騐或恐　，或是對於餓肚子的同情的，又誰願去『負起時代的使命』</p>
<p>呢？就上海的情形看來，不但多數師範生没有出路，就是大多數的大學畢業生，甚至歐美留學生都往往找不着三數十元的職業。我們除了對於現狀要求改革而外，又有什麽法子可以救濟這種恐慌現象呢？這到是一個重要的社社問題·特鄭重提出，請讀者大衆討論一下</p>

<p>浙大校長程天放臨别勉勵學生</p>
<p>國難臨頭乘機用功</p>
<p>負擔救國家之重任</p>
<p>新校長郭任遠到校視事</p>
<p>堅留沈　齋續任秘書長</p>
<p>浙江大學程校長向學生臨别訓話云、今天能和各位同學見面、中心非常高興、兄弟自從到了南昌以後、因爲種種環境、不能離開浙大、使兄弟有點依依不捨、兄北當初没有預料到今天能夠在這裏再有一次談話的機會、所以非常高興同時却是非常悲痛、無論以兄弟個人的志願着想或是本校前途着想、兄弟自已極願意繼續在本校服務、可是現在不能擺脫其他事務這種理由和苦衷、在前二次電報、一封長售喪說得詳細、用不着再來多說</p>
<p>兄弟這次離開浙入、完全是不得已而且自已不顧意的一件事、如果兄北堅辭湖北敎廳　務、不因自已心中學得不安就是對於學校前途、也會有害無益、因此服從政府命令赴湖北去就職、然而心中苦痛實不堪言、兄北離開杭州祇有一個多月、各位試看兄弟現在的面色、是個等　悴最近綫在路上還稍爲休養、所比較好一點在南昌的時候更不如了、兄北在南昌因爲精神上痛苦、所以祇住了七天就離開、如果兄弟在南昌不學得痛苦、那未爲什麽更離開呢、這些祇是對兄北個人而論、對學校同學講、兄弟更是覺得非常慚愧、兄弟在南昌接體各位同事的挽留電報心中、非當愉快</p>
<p>現在兄弟因爲不得已而離開浙大、已經一個多月、在過去一個多月中間、報賴沈秘書長·各院長、全體敎職員、全體同學的努力、維持進行、一切校務、並不因兄弟離校而進頓、兄弟是非常感佩、設或因爲兄麟校而浙大受影　、不是使我痛苦中更加痛苦嗎、現在學校旣然没有影響這使兄弟在苦痛中稍爲得到一點快樂</p>
<p>兄弟自從去年四月就職以來、到現在已經十一個月、在過去短時期、兄弟所做的事、各位都可以看見、兄弟對於辦事一面、是主張如此、凡是應該做的就做、不應該做的就不做遇去十一月中旬時常有同學來請求各種事務、所有有合理的請求、件應許、凡有我認爲不必做不須做、都是加以說明而取銷、决不因爲要見好同學、不分皂白、件件應許、這些各位同學都是親自看見的、現在兄弟離别的時候、各位並不因爲兄弟不能見好同學而怨恨、反而發電報來挽留、這是使兄北覺得一種無窮的快感、如果兄弟在校的時敎部續布</p>

<p>（一）各部分之敎應以初中物理學課内容爲起點遂漸授以物理學上所用之初步方法、使學生對於物理的現象得進一步之了解、敎材萬不應爲大學物理之袖珍縮本（二）講解之時、務必多作簡單實騐表演、以佐學生了解各原理之意義（三）務必使學生能透澈了解各原理及定義之意義、不宜令其徒事背誦字句（四）宜特别注　物理學之應用、不必高談理論及學說（五）宜由敎員領導學生前往參觀與應用物理學有關之壞所（六）須由敎員多擬或選簡單之實用問題與習題、使學生知如何運用各原理以解答之計算之習題、應督促學生每週按指定時日交人、並於詳細改止之後發還（七）應鼓　學生質疑凡遇學生發問時、應由敎員另設較易解决之問题以逐步引到自行解答其疑難之途徑、（八）如遇學生人數超二十人時、問題計論應分爲若干粗、每組人數至多以廿人爲限、分組之時、須將才能相埓之學生（例如由英初中物理成績及初中與高中算學成績判定之）分城同組（九）應多多舉行筆試、試題以屬於計算及解釋者爲宜、肴誦定義及定律一類之題目皆應避免</p>
<p>（二）實騐敎材</p>

<p>（三）實騐應注意各點</p>
<p>（一）上列各實騐不必全作、惟每人全年最少須作實騐一十個、所選之實騐以適應學生之環境爲標準其件質應平均的分配於下列四項（一）等求各現象之因果（二）證明律例之數量的關係（三）實用的問應（四）由　生自造簡易之儀器（二）所用儀器不須十分精密惟所視察之結果則應力求共準確（三）實騐之結果務必用相當之表格記錄之、以訓練學生能作有系統之記載（四）凡遇尋求數量關係之實騐時、務須使學生自行估計並計算其所得結果之差誤（五）於有意　的數碼之去留、及簡捷計算法、須特别注　意六）應使與生明瞭實騐属各步驟之用意切不可令其只知　從實騐數本</p>
<p>爲見　問學而氣求不允、以　日後的挽留那末兄弟的人格是何等卑鄙、如果各　也因在　種情这下、才來挽留兄弟、那末各位同學的人格又是何等卑鄙呢、兄弟在校的時候、既不是有求必允、而現在各位出來挽留兄弟、這是公意的表現、使兄弟一面覺得快樂、一面覺得安慰現在中國還是黑白不明的時期、社會上一切事業都不免如此、而我們學校並設有愛社會的同化、由此可以證明本校的同學、還是有血性有熱誠的青年、這更使兄弟一方面慚愧一方面安慰</p>
<p>過去一個月内、因爲殺境關係、使我不能不夫擔任不願意的工作、但是現在（一）浙大並不因爲兄弟離杭而使學校行政行停頓、同學學業有妨碍（二）兄離校以後、各位同學因公意來電挽留有他兩個緣故、使得兄弟在精神上少多少痛苦得到一些快樂</p>
<p>現在政府已經正式發表郭任遠先生繼任本校校長職務、而郭先生亦於前天到杭州、不久就　就職使兄弟可以安心　養、目前兄弟精神非常衰弱、如果不加以長期休養簡直不能擔任任機關的工作、郭先生曾經在本大學擔任過敎務一都份同學是知道的、而且郭先生是國内研究心理學少數事者中的一個、現在郭先生來擔負浙大校務、兄弟爲浙大屢賀</p>
<p>此次兄弟在長江各埠埠順便考察各地敎育之後覺得浙大實在是有希望的一個大學、　如以開學的日期而論、學校規定二月六日開學、同學都准期到校上課、這件事、不要說現在的大學做不到、就是一般都會的中等學校、也是不能按期上課、長江一帶的中等學校、開事日期都比我們遲並通都在二月十三四、以上課的時間論、去年一學期自從九月一日開學以後、實際上課時間足足十九星期、這不單國内大學不能有這樣長的授課時間、就是普通中學上課時間也比我們短少、這兩件事、已值得我們安慰的、同時我們要保持着這種精神而擴大之</p>
<p>浙大目前最大的問題、就是經費、經費能有辦法學校一切設備可以擴充、圖書可以購買、儀器可以添置、將來成績一定更有可觀、照現在浙大的　風和研究的精神、將來能够在設備方面加以擴充、那天浙大雖不能成爲全國獨一的大學至少也要算是優良大學中的一個</p>
<p>至於浙大費問題、兄弟有一點意思貢獻北弟希望以後浙江大學的經費有一個切實辦法、浙大旣然是國立大學、那末浙大經費應該由中央負擔可是江大是由中央省府雙方負擔、個大學經費、最不穏固是有一個來源結果并得兩無着落議到本校經費、兄弟　得非常慚愧不能在兄弟在内將本校經費完全由中央負擔的任務完結、這是因爲時間太短一點、加以正請求時中央二十年的預算已經確定了以致目的不能逹到、現在兄弟雖然離開浙大兄弟學浙大至少也有一年歷史關係、加以各位同學對於兄弟如此厚愛、將來對於經費問題、祇要兄弟能力所及當然盡量帮忙</p>
<p>最後還有一點意見告訴各位、也可算作兄弟與各位同學的臨别贈言、各位試看現在國家究竟危急到如何地步、而我們還能在國立大學、讀四年書、研究四年學問這眞是一件難能可貴而值得爲各位稱賀的一件事、二十年以前中國一般　人民、都覺得中國有偌大的土地、衆多的人口决不到有瓜分亡國的危險、所謂瓜分亡國、均是庚子時期的名詞罷了、自從前年九一八事件發生以後、單一個土地如此小、人口如此少的日本就可以瓜分了東三省、才把中國人從睡夢覺悟過來、明白現在的中國還是在　瓜分亡國的危險中九一八以後一年多的時間、我們不單不能把東三省收回來、現在熱河又被日本帝國主義强佔去了、在此種情形之下、中國存亡權、完全操在帝國主義者手掌之中、帝國主義者要我們今日亡、我們祇有今日亡這是何等可怕的一回事、中國之所以會衰敗到這個地步、完全由切事業之不進步、中國雖有這麽大的土地、這麽多的人口、這麽富的物産、然結連年内戰、把中國全部元氣斷喪完了、拿民族的力量自已消減完了以致敵人來侵略、我們没有力量來抵抗一個國家的事業直你像個人的事業、一個人平當不注意衛生、一旦病魔侵人無力抵抗、非病在　上不行、照現在國家情形論、兄北不敢說國内的大學定能夠開辦多少時期各位現在旣有求學的機會、希望賣貴這個機會、利用這個機會多多預備自已的力量、將來爲國家努力</p>
<p>我們因爲以前種了種種惡因、所以有今日的惡果、兄弟希望一般二三十歲的血性青年、大家立志下一個善因、否則將來中國危險不堪設想萬一中國亡了、像朝鮮安南一樣、受帝國主義者的壓近、到那個時候、你要讀書研究學問、也不詐你稱心如意罷、試觀印度安南各地的人民有没有這種權利、所以兄弟十分誠意希望各位雖然國家在危險時期中、其實國家愈危險、我們自已的責任愈重大、把竟還有人民的自由、所以趕快趁這個梭　會多多用功、幾年預備、負擔救國家的大任、這個救國的大任、臨到時不論你是否願意、都要你負　起來、爲準備　來能負擔起這個責任、所以希望各位努力</p>
<p>又訊、浙大校長經中央發表郭任遠氏繼任、郭氏於十三日到杭、已於十六日晨到校視事、並正竭力堅留沈　　繼續擔任浙大秘書長、沈氏是否應允續任斯職、尚待考慮</p>

<h3>董事式的國聯</h3>
<p>— 張芷㾗</p>
<p>以前鄉村中，有董事；現在鄉村中，有鄉長。凡鄉長。凡鄉民中發生爭執常　他們做仲　人；可是他們的裁判，因人而施譬如··兩造都是『貧苦　級』，他們的裁判，還能公允確當；　兩造中一方是鄉下『竊小子』，一方是所謂『大户人家』，雖然曲在『大户人家』</p>
<p>是非顯然，那董事老爺的裁判，絶不能像裁判兩造都是『貧苦階級』的那棋爽直允當，至高的限度，扭扭揑揑地對『大户人家』說··『老兄這一次似覺稍不近情』，這算是敷衍那一造『窮小子』的面罷了世界各國堂堂皇皇所組織的以『維持世界和平』做口號的國際聯盟他的行爲，那知也同我國鄒下董事老爺無多分别？怎樣說法？舉例爲證</p>
<p>一千九百二十五年，保加利亞同希臘二國，因邊界哨兵發生衝突，希臘的武裝同志，殺進保加利亞境内，保國的軍民，大吃其虧，據說被殺傷的不在少數，保國這一氣，氣得綠眼睛直向上翻，連心跑到做董事老爺的聯盟先生前，訴說苦情，國聯趕忙去就地查看，查看的結果，很爽直公允地下了一個判斷說··『希軍侵人保境，雖不是預定計劃，但僅僅爲了奪還一處哨地，逐退幾個兵士，居然沿着二十　的陣線作起戰來，那又何必？所以希臘　在二月以内繳付賠欵三千萬里伐』，後來希臘雖然有所不服，但經駐　典的英法意三國公使聯合帶勸帶說，希臘也只好照數賠出</p>
<p>這次中國和日一的满洲爭執，其嚴重性遠出希保爭端，不知多少倍，日軍侵入中國，不像希軍的『不是　定計劃』，一口氣呑下三省地方，現在還繼掠地，也不像希軍的『沿着二十　的陣線作起戰來』，可是這次做董事老爺的國聯，就不像裁判希保爭端的那樣爽而且當賠欵固然是談也不要談，就是對日本說一句『稍不近情』的話頭，也要『千呼萬唤始出來』</p>
<p>經過我國一年多的訴求，才呑呑吐吐地說出來</p>
<p>這是什麽道理呢？哼　蠢貨　你還不明白麽？希臘和保加利亞。都是『貧苦階級』日本却是『大户人家』董事老爺已經給我們的面子，還不夠我們做『窮小子』的感激涕零麽？</p>
<h3>女用高帽子</h3>
<p>— 司晨</p>
<p>伊們一有一需要帶嗎？</p>
<p>高帽子，一般人也許誤會作『一見生財』之類，其實不是；我們中國人一向有句俗語，呌『愛戴高帽子』</p>
<p>這所謂高帽子，並不是一定指要多少尺寸長短的帽子才可以被稱高帽子，這高帽子』三字，只是一些類乎『恭維』</p>
<p>和『推崇』的總代名調罷了。事實上『恭</p>
<p>維』，和『推重』如果是出於他人的眞誠倒也有可說，只可惜多半人的『恭維』</p>
<p>和『推崇』不是有所求於你而假意殷勤便是或則畏則或則懼勢而違心田此的『愛戴高帽子』，一句話寫盡了中國人好虚榮的心理</p>
<p>通常，如稱律師曰『大律師』醫士曰</p>
<p>大醫士』主筆曰『大主筆』老閶曰『大老閶』善士曰『大善士』或稱人，或自稱，都無非是要表示其帽子之高罷了現在我們且來談談女用的高帽子又是如何。你眞不會相信爲什麽伊們頭上會有這麽多的高帽子，你看衹就在學校時代而言，或憑伊們的容貌，或藉伊們的才藝『校花』『皇后』『交際明星』便有伊們的分，至於其餘被稱作什麽『舞星』歌后』『話劇家』『籃球健將』的還算次等呢。但我們試分析構成此種趨尚的根因　則大概可以分作下面這幾層</p>
<p>一　是由於男子對女性的崇拜，和對異性發生一種趣味因而生出來的好奇心理</p>
<p>二　是由於一種天才能操縱一個以上的男子的女姓爲满足一已的虚榮所創造下來的局面</p>
<p>三是由於偏重女性美的提倡所産生的畸形結果</p>
<p>女用高帽子的來源。不難從以上的三種理由當中找尋出來，我不知道自尊的伊們會不會再一有一需要帶它</p>

<h3>漢口是這樣的</h3>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二回</p>
<p>室結芳　暗欽健叟　權家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>不料在怨這樣點頭的時候，那對門的甘二爺也就打算到這邊來，打聽衣服作得了没　看到老姑娘對老人家殷勤招待，而且還誇贊了趙連長兩句，也不知是何緣故，當時胸中很不以爲然。就不肯過來問話，自避到一邊去了。老姑娘回過頭來時，却看到了甘二爺的後影，他人已去遠了。老姑娘對於這事，却不曾介意，便回家來，趕着相甘二爺作衣服。到了這天下午。趙家搬來的東西，差不多已經佈置齊備了，就聽到窗子外面，拍逹拍逹，一陣皮鞋聲響，接着就聽到窗了外有人喊着道··楊太太，我們老爺子來拜訪您了。江氏將頭在玻璃眼裏，向外張望了一下，只見趙自强連長扶着一位老人家，同在房門外站着，江氏呵　了一聲道··這就不敢當。於是隨着話音迎了出來。趙連長就對父親翁道··這位就是楊老太太。又指着身後的人道··這位就是楊太太的大小姐，江氏道··老太爺您别這樣客氣，他呌桂枝，就呌他的小名得了。有老人家呌他的名字。他也長得康健些。趙翁笑嘻嘻的拱手道··不敢當！不敢當！我盼望一輩子，手下有個姑娘，可是總是没有。所以我一瞧見人家姑娘，我就羡慕的了不得。說時，手摸了他那長白的鬍子，哈哈大笑起來。江氏道··老太爺，那有您那福氣啊您趙連長多好哇！將來一定還會升官。趙翁也就笑着道··託您福氣，改日再談罷，我由城裏乍搬出來，遇事還多請關照。說畢，拱了拱手，趙連長跟在身後，半靠半　的將他送到裏面去了。江氏望着，就向桂枝道··看趙連長這樣子，眞是考敬他的老太爺，像你們年輕人，眞得跟人家學學。桂枝笑道··學什麽呀？我可没有法子去當連長。江氏道··並不是要你作官　錢只要你有那分恭敬就得子。這位老太爺倒說得好，指望有你這樣一個閨女呢。閨女長到一百歳，也是人家的人，要閨女作什麽呢？（一四）</p>

<h3>重入銀壇之小妹妹</h3>
<p>— 後覺</p>
<p>當中電影　舞，還在萌芽時代便已　　頭角的妹妹黎明　，經過了長時間的别離，現在居然又重入銀壇上了。伊的故鄉，在三湘七澤之問。伊父親黎錦　，是一位著名的音樂家，伊從小受着父親薰陶，對於音樂歌舞，便有了很深的根低，伊父親辦的中華歌舞社，伊是社中的翹楚。那時伊最擅長的歌舞劇。如『麻雀和小孩』葡萄仙子『月明之夜』『可憐的秋香等，都是含有敎育意義，各學校多採作敎材，不似現在的歌舞團盡是些香　浪漫的靡靡之音。伊初人形界，是在神州公司在『花好月圓』『不堪回首』中，都漏過臉，那時伊還只十歲歲，是一個道地的小妹妹。後來進了大中華百合公司，主演戰功『小廠主』</p>
<p>『探親家等片，活潑的姿態，深刻的表情打人親衆們的心的内層，睢也承認伊是電影演員中最有希望的一個，因爲伊是有魂　有藝術天才的。司是伊忽然脫離銀幕生活。漫游各處去了。伊的足跡。南　星加坡，　羅，爪哇等處，北至關外的東三省各，這又增長伊不少的閱歷和見識。後來到香港，不幸在情海中浙起了萬丈狂濤，直　得轟動中外，於是這漸漸被人們淡忘的小妹妹，又　播於全國人士之口。伊悄悄地回到上海，韜光養晦，不願被人注意，但人們那肯輕易放過伊，尤其是各影片公司的老　，慫恿伊重上銀幕，伊本也戌者　聊，便和天一公司訂了事同，第一部影片，名呌『追求』，是描寫青年男女的戀愛糾紛，伊在劇中，飾一個銀行行長的女兒，嬌憨活潑依然不减昔年小妹妹的豐韻。伊雖是影壇先進但是主演有聲影片，這次還是處女作。聽說『追求』不久要公映了，我們準備在銀幕上去瞻仰　别多年的小妹妹豐彩吧</p>
<h3>舞台之裝飾</h3>
<p>— 寓一</p>
<p>舞台内之裝飾。紅綠對比之色在我爲俗。在西洋則視爲野蓋五色雜配。紅綠青橙之對比者。爲野蠻人之嗜好。西人利之以爲廣告借動一般之注意。以　益爲門佈。虎爪爲足飾。及白鶴之頂。山龍之首。亦皆爲未開化民族之動物愛好。皆非宜於現代之裝飾現代之舞台裝飾乃作純潔之幾何形體。而塗以純潔之色。其用幾何形體。缐條亦極簡單準確。或竟以簡單直綫。卽構成全院之圖案形式　簡。色彩愈純。如　物之色。僅有結晶體各函光暗不同之分。並無雜色相配之混。故以致玟瑰紫爲色。則全院皆　如大塊紫石呈現各面不同之光彩。以翡翠綠爲色。則全院皆綠色比配。如珠光實氣至眞　純。此在上海之影戲院中。可見斑。法蘭西現代之舞台裝飾則尢爲單純。令人引起無限爽潔之感。統謂之爲幾何形色之裝飾。舞囼爲美術之综合處。並空間時童間之美而皆有之。其裝飾與其背影　。尤爲主要。但上海之社會藝術中。最不愜吾人之意者。卽爲舞台裝飾與背景。中西式樣之拉雜色彩之眩混。令人坐不安席。其紅朱之中國　柱式。配以西洋　苕式之柱頭。一團和氣之後幕。而配以西洋風景之背景。非驢非馬。尤爲惡劣。反不如往時之紅　　上。清歌一曲之耐人尋味也。</p>

<h3>粉巿不影氣的主因</h3>
<p>走銷呆滯··大廠出檔</p>
<p>昨日粉巿、上午開盤後、各月份微呈平稳之象以坎麥報價、回漲四五角左右、故各月份開價、似見好面、較前日回起五厘左右、以後各盤實因客帮交易、異常沉寂、各路之内地帮、亦因銀根緊迫、完全停頓、所以巿氣終　起色迨至下午開盤、遠期大廠仍陸總出檔、巿氣卽見不振、本月份尚平定、後因大廠亦步脫手亦見帶落、查目下各廠存底又豐、如本月份客帮抽買未勤、或須再落也、結果本月份較前日跌七厘半、四月份跌一分五六七月份跌二厘　半、八月份跌一分云</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於『救國』</h3>
<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>歷史上的事實後來是這樣··必定要到所謂『國難』時期『國家』　和『人民』發生關係當然，在平時，也並不是没有『關係』，但這關係只是『受治』只是『缴納租稅』實際上『國家』並不是呌做『人民』的，而是一部分人的</p>
<p>『我們的國家遭難了』，『我們的民族危險了』，一旦臨到了『國難』，一部分人便這樣地大聲疾呼着。不消說，這種呼聲是呌『人民』『共赴國難』，『共起救國』</p>
<p>然而假如你眞的相信『國難』是可以眞的自由地『共赴』，眞的可以自由地『换救』那你又不僅是有點　，簡直會『犯罪』的。因爲『人民』的『救國』，從古以來，是只限於『有力者出力』有財者輪財』，至於『其他』『乾坤　斷』者自有人在，旣無庸你問，也不容你問。這樣，所以漢朝的卜式被尊稱爲『典型國民』</p>
<p>歷史的戲劇是繼續地復演到現在，現在，我們又臨到『國難時期』了。明明地現在又有人在高呌着··『國民奮起，共赴國難』，然而『武裝抗日』是『不許』的，甚至於主張武裝抗日也是不許』的，『許』的是什麽？是科學救國，是航空救國，是游藝，跳舞以至美容救國。總結句說，還是不外乎『有力者出力，有財者輸財』而且，你用不着問輸国了力與財的下文　單說航空救國罷。自然，在這『没有空軍便没國防』的時代，誰也不會否認『航空』的重要但，帝國主義者的鐵蹄已經踏碎我們半壁山河了，『亡國之禍，迫近眉睫』我們却還在悠然自得地提倡航空救國，捐募『兒童號』，『寗波號』··就不說這是顆烟幕彈，但遠水是不是能救近火呢</p>
<p>而且所謂兒童號寗波號··募集以後，究竟做什麽用？這也似乎是一個終於不能不問的問題。做什麽用呢？九一八之役，張少帥的三百架飛機送給日本人了，廣東二陳之爭，飛麽艦給空軍炸沉了，還有散傅單，還有剿匪，用處似乎是僅止於此，的幾天雖說報纸上也曾載有『飛機ＸＸ架飛向Ｘ方去』的新聞，但黃鶴一去，也終於没有了下文，誰能說牠們不是避難去了呢？所以說句天理良心話，『航空』與我國的『國防』到底還不曾發生什麽實際關係　假如航空眞的可以救國的話，我們便要求先把現在全所有的飛機飛到戰地去抗日，假如國難是眞的可以共赴的話，我們便要求全國人民自動武裝抗日。否則一切都是廢話，老把戲還只是這麽一套</p>
<h3>跌</h3>
<p>— 朱霎</p>
<p>江海關大鐘的長手臂劃破了深黑的天空。江裏的潮水嘩喇嘩喇的在衝，什麽皇后號壓尖了嗓子哆的一聲兒喘着满嘴巴白沬，好像玩膩了了都巿樣的溜走了。一輛六汽缸雪鐵龍轎車以三十七英里的速率在愛多亞路上儘往外灘衝，衝到一所寫有什麽交易所的房子前停下。從車門裏跳出三個四十來歲的男子，江面上浮着白茫茫的晨義，從石像的腋下漏進了一陣輕風，三個男子就縮了縮脖子往大房子裏一竄</p>
<p>大房子裏的圓鐘，也伸着手臂告訴我們··七點二十五分</p>
<p>『瞧，說早也不早啦，亭昌兆豐的不都已來了嗎？喂，逸老，你瞧那個子矮的一個，昨天也扒進了四十條多頭咧』</p>
<p>被稱作逸老的就說，『要不是耿老招呼你，你還想跟老九樂一下子咧。天不早啦。』正想笑，忽然那矮個子的過來招呼了</p>
<p>『逸老，早。瞧風頭兒，巿面要有變』化吧湯玉麟不是退出承德嗎？···』</p>
<p>說起巿面，四個頭立刻鑽聚在一起放低了聲音說話</p>
<p>『你老扒進的多頭會佔了上風啦』姓耿的這麽說</p>
<p>全場全這麽說；金子在這當口兒，買多的那一個肯出籠呢？跌風縱然那麽猛可是誰不望它回漲？跌也跌不了七百兩大關，回漲倒准有好處的</p>
<p>時光在全場飛奔，繞着每個人的心大門裏陸陸續續的踱進了不同嘴臉的男人，時光又在他們心上爬着</p>
<p>九點啦，還没開巿　』被丢在别個人堆裏的矮個子的這時又過來了美國銀行風潮嗎？新總統上任嗎？九點還没開巿　』全塲全這麽說</p>
<p>交易所臨時通告是··『待匯豐掛牌揭曉後，照常開巿</p>
<p>九點四十分··開盤六百九十八兩逸老他們三個人跟那矮個子的瞧定了『兩』字不轉睛，一座座沙遜房子般的密芝根州銀行在他們腦膜上晃，一晃彷彿就倒了。···八個眼珠子全發了紅</p>
<p>『果然衝進了七百兩大關啊？美國禁金出口咧，那兒來的這陣怪的跌風啊矮個子的這樣　語着</p>
<p>美匯匯豐不掛牌、那來的標準？多方全這麽說。矮個子的跳到二十七號經紀人跟前，出那麽問。做了一萬條多頭的兆豐要求把圖章送到理事會</p>
<p>時光在每個人心上爬；巿塲停止買賣了</p>
<p>『耿老，听咱們做的五百條。放了它吧瀉了五十兩。』</p>
<p>散户多頭全在鬆！鬆了它吧！巿場跌到六十兩</p>
<p>『咱們做的放了吧！瀉了八十八！逸老，有誰要扒空，出了籠吧』</p>
<p>『出了籠吧！』多方全那麽說。眼珠子全發了紅</p>
<p>空方乘機又抵進。逸老他們三個人的五百條出了籠。『咱們瞧着風頭兒進那麽點關裁吧！』又像满不在乎地說</p>
<p>汽車從馬路中走過來，駝着满背心太陽，他們三個人鑽進去。歐的一聲兒突着灰白的眼珠了</p>
<p>大世界面前的大鐘，手臂已劃到了十一點</p>
<h3>狂犬</h3>
<p>— 錢歌川</p>
<p>近來在一種小報上，發見幾篇像是駡我們的文字，考其動因，不外是一種卑劣的報復手段　因爲這幾天我們在自由談上，無意地拆穿了詞賊章某的西洋鏡，把他那些自命爲傑作的賊物指明白了。其實做賊旣已被人捉到，正應當天發誓，痛改前非，叩頭救釋才是，又何必一定要使他『弄堂裏的小福三一聞同夥有事便廢拳捋衫』來不分皂白地狂吠一陣呢？</p>
<p>對於這種恬不和恥的小　三的狂吠，本没有加以答復的必要，不過我覺得他們旣已長成了人形，而又全無人性，不解是非，實在太可憐了，我們站在人道主義上，不能不略爲指點他們一下</p>
<p>第一，你們應學的··做文章不論是褒是貶態度總要光明。不可仍然蹲在籬笆後面狂吠吠得不在理的時候，『自由』棍是會打倒你頭上來的。並且，你着單在『雷』底下放屁『雨』底下撤水，終是没有人聽見，没有人看見的</p>
<p>第二，你們應學的··自已不懂得的事，萬不可跟着人家附和。因爲附和起來，不僅你們的行徑，欲蓋彌彰，反而又要多閙些笑話，加演些醜態。忠言逆耳，這話你們也許要再來狡辯　不過事實已呈現到萬人的眼前，訂正也來不及了</p>
<p>那小報的銷路不多，我這里說『萬人』，也許要失之誇張。没有看見那些小報的人，且聽我來說個明白</p>
<p>有署名『春雷』者，在什麽感言上說··『他（指錢歌川）以前在北新『青年界』所作的介紹賈克倫敦的大文，更是全篇抄譯商務印書館的藍皮小業書的『賈克倫敦的生活』（ＴheLifeofjacklondon）并且還把他死一九二○年　抄得爲死在一九一六年。』在上面這幾句話中便閙了兩大笑話，不曉得是『春雷』其人，在　壤下面聽錯了的呢，還是他的先生說錯了，查青年界一卷三期上那篇介紹賈克倫敦的文章原是孫席珍先生作的，與錢歌川無涉。孫先生文章上說賈克倫敦生在一八七六年，死在一九一六年，原是一點不錯。上海小　三的本領雖大，恐也不能挽回天年罷。若賈克倫敦是那篇上面所說的『老二先生』的話，我們還可以驚嘆他讀書頗有心得，能牢記着書上的『假我數年』一語，可惜這位洋老大，又没說過那麽一句再看『伯雨』其人所獻的醜態吧。他說章某的浪淘沙是和納蘭性德的，古人做時塡詞，誠然有和，什麽呌做『和』呢，農科裏的先生，當然不會敎你的，現在我來敎你吧，和只應當和每韻的最末一字，不可把整句，或半句全和去而且和一定要和原韻，卽原來那個字，别人說『秋』你和成『愁』字，便錯了，如范成大原唱是『傾坐東風百媚生一，陳三聘若把它和成一個『酒力先從臉暈升』便不算是和了</p>
<p>最後我還得對李文遠其人，指導幾句，纔算公平無偏。他說新中華創刋號上錢歌川不應參考了中外書籍來介紹世界文學，這更是笑話因爲做介紹文章，正是非參考中外書籍不可的因爲那是事實的介紹，必得言有所本，不能借口開河。如果做那種文章，也能創作的話那只好學『春雷』其人的辦法把别人的生死年月全般改變了</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（三十）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>可是，他們將規矩和雅潔敎了他以後，他們對於他，甚至對於他那可怕的趣　　也　熟起來。一天，那老紳士對她說道『像你這樣美妙的年青女儘管没有丈夫和兒女是不行的我是於你太老太老了；你還是同那　爾　人結緍的好</p>
<p>因爲她獻身於那老紳士已經是很專一的了，所以她起初聽得他要她同其他什麽人結緍，不由得非常憤怒，甚至整夜打景着，要用她的諾勃凱黎將那愛爾蘭人趕出那地方去。對於她呢那老頭子是太早生了六十年了，照自然的道理，他一定要死，而且要下他做没伴侣的人的這一層她原也不以使自已承認。然而那老紳士却將這些明白的事實深深地印進她的腦子裏終於是她讓步了！兩人一同走進菜圓裏，對那愛爾蘭人說。她要同他結緍了他一聲驚喊，抓起他的鐘來，便向圍門衝去。然而黑女孩子却早已防備好。將那門鎖住了；他來不及爬過那門去，他們就追到他將他緊緊地拉住了</p>
<p>『是我同異敎徒的黑女結緍麽？』他凄然呌，同時將他新近習得的語言上的種種文雅全都忘却了。『讓我去好不好。我不要同誰結緍。』</p>
<p>然而黑女孩子却用鐵樣的緊握（硬裏却也有些軟軟的）抓住了他；那老紳士又對他明說，如果他逃掉罷、他無非落在麽陌生女人的手，這種女人是不關心於尋神的事，她的皮膚也並非他所厮熟的發亮的黑緞子那樣却是灰樣青白的。經過了半點鐘光景的辯論和懲恿，外加那老紳士的最上等的白關地杯之後，終於他說道『哦哦，那麽我也没有什麽了』　於是他們結緍了；黑女子對於那愛蘭人和兒子們（他們是嬌媚的咖啡色）照管的很能幹漸至於十分喜愛他們了。在關於他們和園地，以及修補她丈夫的衣服（這種衣服，要呌他）</p>
<p>棄掉不穿是没有辦法的）這種種事情，她忙個不停，於是在她大部分的時間她尋神這一椿事情，丢在她的腦後了。然而有些時間，尤其是當她那心愛的很柔順很安靜的小囝洗了浴之後，她給他揩乾身子的時候，她的心却也回想起她的尋求來；只有這時候她纔覺得··這是多麽有趣呵！一個生活不安定的女孩子，敎士敎她將神看倣事是看住好所做的一切事情，專是操心於她救恩的一個傢伙，她便自以爲是宇宙的中心，居然出發拜訪神了，她甚至還逗着那小囝玩，向他問道，『假如我在家襄見到了神，他暗示着我在這里住的太久，他不耐煩了，那時候我怎麽辦呢？』這是那小囝完全不能回答的問題··他只不過歇斯的里地笑一笑將她的手腕抓一下罷了。待到小囝們長大起來，不復依靠她，那愛爾蘭人呢，已經成爲她的不知不覺的體質彷彿他是她自身的一部分了，那時候，他們繼不復將她從她自身奪去，她從新有使她霍地回想到這等問題上來，這一種閑睱和孤寂了。到那時候，她的加强了的心已經將她遠帶到那一階段以外了，在那一階段，用諾勃凱黎打碎種種偶像這一椿事情是好玩的（全篇完）</p>

<h3>羅霖師追剿贛西孔匪</h3>
<p>匪衆分南北竄擾</p>
<p>被擊後其勢已蹙</p>
<p>南昌通信、贛西孔匪、自月初傾巢東竄上高·新喻·分宜·奉新·高安各地後、一時咸感風鶴之驚、經羅霖師分途堵勦、雖尚未盡殱餘孽、而匪勢已蹙、茲紀經過情形如下</p>
<p>先是湘軍彭任仁師、由瀏平向贛邊大舉圍勦孔匪、羅霖師駐高村之席旅及駐銅鼓之唐團、即向前推進、恊同堵擊、匪遂由間道竄至萬載之三百興二日、突由萬盧間之黃田渡瑞河東竄、適駐盧家州之羅部胡營偵知、馳往截擊、匪適半渡、斃者數百、落水死者尤多、奪檢三四十支時已日暮、胡營即由盧巿會同該師駐芳塘之蔣營、徐家渡之薛營·向南恊勦、而匪極飄忽、竟於三日指曉、繞由翰塘襲陷上高、羅部團長陳有朋即率胡蔣薛各營折由界塘急進、於三日午後規復上高、匪又分南北潰竄</p>
<p>其北竄者爲僞十八軍、人約二午、槍約七八百、四日竄過新圩村前一帶、（高安上高之接界處）陳團追至棠浦、五日、匪北竄南山、被陳團追及、適該師易副師長率直屬部隊、趕至夾擊、激單半日、匪不支復向東北潰竄、六日、匪經陳團跟擊至奉新、又被岳師工輜兩營堵截、傷亡及俘獲者、逹二三百改西竄七日、陳團至羅村南岸、匪隔河頑抗、經徒涉直撲、又大　匪於雷公崖·天子山、菲輜重概委秦、斃者百餘、奪槍頗多、救出肉票工七八十人匪繼竄九仙湯、又遇團隊堵擊改道狼狽西竄、現匪部損失過半、羅霖仍令胡旅由潭山等處堵截、陳團仍在追擊中</p>
<p>其南竄者爲僞十六軍、人約三千、槍千餘并有機槍迫砲無線電等、四日、經過翰塘轉竄水口圩·水北一帶、五日、更擾及英岡嶺、六日忽分擾馬湖·水口圩·江原各地、逼近新喻分宜、因羅部劉團（駐新喻）及鄧營（駐分宜）嚴爲戒備、不得逞時羅又檄調萬載銅鼓之席旅及李春光團馳抵南港、向匪進勦、多所斬獲、八日匪乃西竄、團回老巢、羅霖爲澈底肅清殘匪計、仍令席旅長率部窮追、務絶根株如西南兩方軍隊、能深進堵勦、不難完全消滅也</p>
<p>此次赤匪之南北分竄、原有重大逆圖、據俘匪供述、原擬分送進犯高安之羅霖師部、觀其北竄者曾徘徊於新圩村前之間（距高約五十里）南竄者初亦徘徊於水北英崗嶺之間、（距高約六十里）似可徵信、唯以陳團追擊狂烈、北竄之僞十八軍受創遠遁、遂使逆圖未能得逞、又六日以後、南竄之匪、逼近新喻、安福朱師長且電告僞八軍李天柱部、有槍三千餘及機槍廹砲無缐電等、突由永興經安福西端竄赤谷、圖犯新分、是赤匪尚有聯合進犯新分逆圖乃匪以第一步計劃未得實現、而席旅又迅速南下追勦、遂使僞十六軍倉皇回繞、由宜春境内回竄、其第二步逆圖、隨之破壞亦云幸矣</p>

<h3>鐵部計劃津浦京滬聯運</h3>
<p>兩路實行全部通車</p>
<p>並與沿線水道聯絡</p>
<p>鐵道部以京滬杭兩路整頓客貨军成績漸著、茲部長顧孟餘擬逐漸改進、以冀使兩路成爲鐵路中之模範、十六日并由鐵部令飭兩路局、速即計劃兩路統一行車管理辦法、及兩路沿線水陸聯運公路聯運辦法、以便即日實行、新聲社記者訪該部業務司長俞　、帮辦譚耀宗、詢以詳細辦法、茲錄其談話如下</p>
<p>舉辦兩路全部通車　俞譚二氏謂京滬滬杭甬兩路全線行程、不及津浦一路、歷來均以兩路客貨運加以劃分、僅曰開聯運通車而已鐵部以兩路本屬銜接、若能各項無論特别快車三四等車乃至貨車、均能銜接直通、客貨運之暢通、時間之經濟、人　力之節省、於乘客貨商、鐵路均有莫大之便利、例如向之客貨運商、由嘉興至常州者、除聯運車而外、必須在交义站、多所耽擱與手續今一加改良、則兩路起站以迄終站之其間各站、均可隨時搭車、按址上下其客貨運之價格、均照舊章、决不增加、視兩路爲一路、革除歷來耗時間不經濟之積弊、現鐵部已擬定原則、令飭兩路局對於此項統一行車管理辦法、加具意見、即日籌備、大約至遲二三月後、必可實現、届時兩路車務、等於一路直接往來即行車時間、亦可相當經濟也</p>
<p>沿綫水道公路聯運　兩路之負責運輸、旣已實現、惟　爲各站之便利、鐵部亦决舉辦兩路沿線重要水路地　負責　運、例如浙江平　之貨運、江蘇洞庭山之貨運、向須駁運至鐵道附近交站運出、如水陸聯運舉辦、則一切手續、均可由鐵路負責辦理、經濟時間兩感簡捷、此外如滬杭甬蕭紹段公路、曹娥江段公路、亦在計費與鐵路聯運、京蕪公路與京滬路聯運、均已商有辦法、即可實現、如此兩路附近、不問其接近公路或僅通水道、均可設法由鐵路代爲運輪、商貨流通、便利當不在少也</p>

<h3>談言</h3>
<h3>同情</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>同情二字，本來就很難說，因爲我覺得這兩個字究竟來得過於空泛，不信且讀下文</p>
<p>譬如說某一　脚的朋友，因爲肚皮餓得難受也去同情他嗎？這種搶刦的行爲是否值得我們仁人君子的同情呢？這就很難說了，固然，他的肚皮餓了，而且餓得難受，晤，對了，我們有時也餓過來的確是不大好過，是的。我們想同情他，而且值得我們同情他，於是我們同情他了。但是他現在是取之不義的搶刦别人了，這是國法所不能容許的，於是你說該打，他更說該打，那末我們呢？也說該打罷，因爲我們怎敢違反衆意呢這樣，我們便將同情飢餓者的同情心移轉給米店老　了。於是我們便同情米店老閒高抬貴手來毆打這個我們所同情的蹩脚朋友了</p>
<p>詩人說，『我是富於同情心的，而且最同於妻的苦悶，』可是不幸得很詩人失戀於妻、而且妻已另有新歡，於是我們的詩人怒氣衝天，將妻打在地下咬牙切齒的說··『我眞不能同情你這種無恥的行動』</p>
<p>科學家同情人類的生活，過於呆滯，於是極力發明以增進人生的快樂。並且科學家更同情貧苦大衆的求生不得求死不能，於是又發明了各種的殺人機器　使他們能夠在毒瓦斯的氣焰中升入天堂</p>
<p>東北養勇軍在飛機大砲和坦克車的屠敎中爲反帝國主義而戰，這是最值得我們仁人君子同情的那末將軍元帥們爲保存國家原氣而請敵人登堂入室那又怎樣呢？同情他罷，反正我們的同情是多得可以的</p>
<p>原來，同情便是這樣一種難於理解的東西</p>

<h3>店員通訊</h3>
<h3>航空救國</h3>
<p>— 張忠謣　吳興海</p>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>我們的信，承蒙你在三月四日的貴刋裏發表；並蒙奬許，不勝感謝之至我們不應該『空口說白話』，老是嘴裏喊『航空救國』或者在文字裏，寫幾句時髦話。因有這些多是無補事實的呀！我們的力量，雖然很微，但是江河由於滳水，狐裘集於片腑；故此我們現在寄上大洋二元。望先生轉交航空恊會；並望全國的學徒，大家起來，把月規錢和一切閒用的錢，省下來，來造成這學徒號飛機，去驅逐兇暴的倭奴。這是我們十二分的希望呀！專此奉逹，並請努力</p>
<p>張忠謣　吳興海同上</p>
<p>編者按··這幾天，我們接到許多青年的來信；他們因爲看到這幾天的日本　更其蠻横無理，政府全無辦法，束手退讓。他們的愛國心，激得已經忍無可忍，一個個都表示願意到前線去殺敵他們這種表示，當然是出於愛國的熱忱　編者對之，除了敬佩之外，更有何說呢！但是對外作戰，應付國難，是一件極艱鉅的工作；必須全國上下，一德一心，步伐整齊，才以收效。果然政府應當高瞻遠屬，心有城府；國民方面，也應當準備犧牲一切，去做政府的後盾不過因爲要求其步伐整齊起見，我們國民，現在祇應該在『準備』兩個字上下功夫；萬不可因爲一時的衝動，無秩序的動員，反亂政府當局的方寸。現在政府一方面，因爲所有的兵力，足可調遺所以並不要求國民。到前線去殺敵同</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>時另一方面，因爲空軍的設備，與敵人比較，實在差得太遠，非而亟謀補充不可並且國家的財力，不夠舉辦這一件事所以在各地徵求人民恊助。在這種情形之下，我們正眞愛國的人民，第一應當罄我們的財力，在這一個方向上努力我們並不是說。我們不該到前線去殺敵，不過說現在是並不十分需要罷了我們該隨時準備着，等到政府一開口說『現在你們國民應當到線去了』的時候，全體國民，都能夠束裝就道，不要做聰明人，明知政府不許你去的當兒偏偏亂喊着到前線去；等到政府要你們去的時候，反而有難色了</p>
<p>上次我們接到張吳兩君的來信，他們的救國情緒，雖則溢於言表··但並不喊着要到前線去，他們却誠心誠意地照着政府所提倡的路徑，贊成航空救國現在他們的來信，更進一步爲實際的表示。照他們這種態度看來，編者敢斗膽下一句斷語，『一旦政府眞的要求我們上前綫去的時候，他們决計比現在嘴裏喊上前線去的人們，跑在前面』這般聰明不過的人，那時或許要唱起比現在更高的高調來，以求倖免犧牲呢　所以我們對於張吳兩君的愛國的態度，並不因爲他僅僅是兩元的小數目，而加以忽視，我們已經恭而敬之的將這兩塊大洋鈿，轉送航空恊會；並且將收條，寄給兩君。我們曉得舊式商店裏的小學徒　辛辛苦苦了一月，所得的代價，大概不會多於一元的；所以張吳兩君的這兩塊大洋錢，實在就是他們全月的收入連另用都没有扣去。假使全中國的國民個個能夠把自已一個月的收八，貢献給國家去買飛機，那末中國的空軍，至少也可與日本比美了。前天編者爲一件要事，到本巿某某局去訪友，無意中聽到他的同事們，唉聲嘆氣的在那裏議論說什魔『正眞該死，現在我們的薪水因爲什麽『航空救國』的緣故，要打折扣了』你想一個堂堂公務人員，爲了救國的大事，他的薪水，僅僅打些折扣已經怨聲載道，這樣看來，張吳兩君的這兩塊錢，實實在在是可貴了</p>
<p>這幾天據航空恊會裏的人說，自從熱河失守以來，我們會裏收入的捐欵天天少下來了。當時我聽了非常奇怪過後一想，才　然大悟。原來聽明的人們，看見政府這樣不中用。就灰心了預備把與其捐給航空恊會的錢，留着等到做了亡國奴之後，慢慢使呢！唉！寫到這裏，編者實在不忍再冩下去了但是又不能不寫。你想那一設湯玉麟之類的混賬東西，本來是靠不住的，我們希望他死守熱河，本來是滑稽的把戲所以熱河可說老早是失了的，並不是湯玉　跑了之後才失的呀　所以熱河的失不失，實在對我們的愛國心，不應該發生關係；即使要發生關係，也只可因此而加意努力，决不有因此而灰心的理由况且我們提倡航空救國，是明知我們的空軍，不如敵人，交戰起來，敗多勝少，所以在這個計劃没有成功之前，吃幾仗敗仗，是在意料中的</p>
<p>全國的學徒們呀！全國的周胞呀你們起來贊助這航空救國的事業吧這是不容遲疑的，這是刻不待緩的。你們捐幾個錢到航空恊會去，比你們上前綫去殺敵，還需要</p>
<p>至於張吳兩君提議的『學徒號』一層　我們以爲祇可暫時保留，將來倘使學徒的捐欵，確有成數的時候，再行提出末了們要聲明，無論做什麽事，多要步伐整齊；所以以後的捐欵，請直接交於本埠八仙橋青年會仙航空恊會爲荷</p>

<p>『雖然有二十多塊錢，但是離放假還有二個多月，以後···』伍逸不敢貿然嘗試</p>

<h3>各國電影敎育運動概况（下）</h3>
<p>— 陳婉</p>
<p>國立少年電影敎育局，以研究供給兒童電影敎材爲目的。他們主張小學敎育之電影敎材，以修身，歷史，地理，自然等科爲宜。兒童社會敎育之電影敎材，以冒險，狩獵，牧童水手生活，印度人生活，動物生活，歷史事實，神話傅說，外國風俗習慣等爲宜。而各片終局，尤須明示惡破滅，善勝利。舉凡殘忍殺人，癲狂兇病，犯罪賭博，性慾奢侈，死後地獄，以及犯上作亂等資料，均在擯斥之列。此外美國民間之敎育慈善團體，亦頗熱心於電影敎育之提倡，如波士頓敎育工業會，每年補助巨額經費，以推行電影敎育。各地婦人俱樂部，又多募集基金，於每週開映敎育電影，以陶治她們兒童的身心　日本的電影敎育運動，以文部省社會敎育局爲中心。除從事編製敎育影片及推奬審定之優秀之影片外，更聯絡各府縣廳之社會敎課，防疫衛生課等，開映關於社會敎育之影片。惟成績不甚顯著。現在日本衆電影敎育運動中之最活動，最有組織，最有實績者，厥爲全日本電影敎育研究會。此會成立谥一九二七年七月，以大阪每日新聞社與東京日日新聞社合組的大每影片文庫與東日影片文庫爲基本組織，因該兩新聞社自一九零八年以來，編製優秀之新聞敎片，不下數千卷，组織電影班數十隊，巡廻映演於全國鄉村僻壞頗熱心於電影民衆敎育的運動；最近且又添設有聲電影班。自全日本乹影敎育研究會成立以來，其事業組織，益見推廣。研究會之事務所，即設於該兩新聞社内。在會員五十名以上的地方，設置支部，作爲地方電影敎育運動之中心機關。截止一九三二年七月止，全國已設有支部凡四十四處，特别會員與普會通員不下數萬人。又該會爲養成地方電影敎育運動指導人材起見，於每年夏季必擇地舉行電影敎育夏季講習會一次，頗著聲譽</p>
<p>大每影片文庫，設於大阪巿。東日影片文庫，設於東京巿。此外尚有分庫七所，分佈於满洲，台灣，朝鮮，門司熊本，金澤，名古屋等處，所藏影片約四千餘卷，均分類編目，愼重　藏。每日提取映演之數，僅大每本庫一處平均約三萬米突。造成全國之民衆電影敎育網，爲他們之最大目標云</p>
<p>此外世界各國，亦均有具體的電影敎育運動與審查製度，因限於篇幅，不再備列。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評『琵琶怨』</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>『琵琶春怨』！就這富於Ｓentimant的字義看來，我們便很可以想像得出這一定是一個悲劇了</p>
<p>本來，個悲劇是很容易動人情感的當然是容易討好的，但是這必須有好的題材，而且必須正確的把握這種題材，使這題題材能夠充分的發展下去，以藝術的理解力去正確所分析它，而以悲劇的形式去剌戟觀衆，使觀衆在畫面的感觸之下，而毫無歪曲的認識了，某種事件之核心，而立刻感覺到自身之出路　於是在這裏便提出了電影製作者的意識形態的問題了</p>
<p>那末，在『琵琶春怨』中，我們的製作者提出了一種什麽中心問題呢？我們在畫面上所能看到的是ScenarioWtitel對於目前鄉村中所根深蒂國的封建勢力表示不满。一個夫和一個鰥寡婦假如旣經相愛了便應當結婚，但是他告訴我們事實上並不是如此簡單，她們終於受不了奮禮敎的包圍，終於屈服在封建勢力的淫威之下。當然我們並不否認。在中國鄉村中像這樣的女子的確還有很多她們只有怯懦的心情，只有流不盡的眼涙。可是我們對於這種可恥的情態是不是就讓它永遠繼續下去呢？大胆的說『不』那末這劇如此怯懦的寡婦，便不應出現在最有敎育意義的銀幕之上，而成爲一般落後水準的婦女們的典型了其中對於封建勢力的淫威總算是暴露了的，對於一般自已軋姘頭而勸人守節的女人們，也加以Humour的嘲笑，然而這是非常不夠的，一種無出路的備寫</p>
<p>始終不是新Realsim的藝術作品，不僅是没有反封建勢力，而相反的正爲封建勢力而說敎</p>
<p>至於本片的演出，導演之藝術的描寫手腕有些地方是還可取的。自李令嫻死了丈夫回到家鄉之後，導演很細巧的去盡力描寫，這對於悲劇是特别適宜的但是在上半截的諸塲面中，却不免令人忍俊不住。而且在劇情上，也是再『巧』没有，李令嫻的面貎，居然和馬醫生的亡妻生得一模一樣，佈景有些地方露出做假的痛迹，特别是那鵝毛大雪令人一見便知是纸片的飛舞。女主角自　鄉間來上海時，不應那樣華而焕，因爲鄉村的樸質和都巿的奢侈相對比，乃是很夠味兒的</p>
<p>高倩蘋的性弱無能，總算是相當描畫出來了。可是非常不夠，尤其前段不佳，鄭小秋毫無精采　憶秋是演得最好的一個，張敏玉很有表演『天才』</p>
<h3>『琵琶春怨』之一幕</h3>
<p>在中央上海兩院開映</p>
<h3>看了『情聖』歸來</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>『情聖』ＨollyLovel是羅那考爾門RonaldColman的光榮綽號，而另一個『情聖』Cynara却是羅那考爾門的新片以『情聖』來主演『情聖』倒是美談　這一張影片的故事，是很簡單的說一對青年夫婦，因事分離很久，那青年丈夫認識了一位女郎，然而他爲了已經結婚，而他的妻子不久又已歸來，他便與女郎斷絶來往，不料女郎一往情深　竟致自殺，他雖不負負什麽法律責任但是社會冷潮熱諷的譏他薄情，他只好出而航海他去，他妻子也能諒解他，所以他和　宿雙飛另尋樂園去了</p>
<p>一部一萬尺的影片，而只有短短的本事，當然，這是給了演員許多發展的機會，考爾門雖然老了，精神很好，而他老練沉著的表演，更是值得贊美的自始至終，無懈可擊。他所飾的青年丈夫，對於愛情的幾幕，輕描淡寫的表示出『進退維谷』的地方，無微不至從他冷靜的動作，流露出深刻而眞摰的『情』他的妻子是凱法蘭茜斯KayFrancis飾的，這是他們第二次合作了，她有不少地方的表演，較爲上乘的，女郎自殺是茀麗絲芭瑞RhyllsBarry她有比法蘭茜絲更好的表演，游泳的一幕，十足顯出了女性的健美和誘惑性，一顰一笑都夠使人生出憐愛之情</p>
<p>導演是『蠻女天堂』的導演全維多他自有高强的手腕，呌人很佩羡，但是這片中的青年夫婦，一别七年，而看他們離别之前，和重逢以後，絶對不像如許之久，似乎是導演失計之處，攝影光線都很好，剪接方面全片的　挿對照　就是極優美的，小鏡頭Closeup生色</p>
<p>牠的外景，幽靜的美，使人心噴神怡，全片細膩的表演，持藝的綜合，完全不失默片的長處</p>
<p>劇情是美國片中少見的，牠痛譭着青年們盲目戀愛的。不正當，盡力發揚夫婦的倫理</p>
<p>牠是一張有意義的片子　雖然有不少小漏洞，恕不一一談及　雖然没有剌激各緊張，却也能夠激動觀衆的心情</p>
<h3>談談春潮</h3>
<p>— 艾霞</p>
<p>春潮，春潮是我多麽生動的名字，這是屠湼夫的小說，現在由亭生公司鄭應時改編爲劇本，就由鄭君導演，顏鶴眠攝影兼收音</p>
<p>旣然是名作，這部片子大概總有相當的成功</p>
<p>現今的中國，攝製有聲片本來是件極不容易的事，顏君他知道中國有聲電影的需要，在不斷地努力之下鶴鳴通是成功了，亭生公司也就因之而産生他們不是資本家，他們在窮幹，他們有團結不畏難的精神</p>
<p>春潮中述一個少年張國華同他的表妹嚴玉瑛戀愛，但他的表妹因經濟的壓迫被她母親以買賣式的婚姻訂給一位有錢少年，嚴玉瑛是萬分的不满意，結果是同那位富家子弟離婚，對方要求退還從前所供給金錢，他們是這樣窮苦，商量後張國華决計國鄉下去賣田，不幸這位買主是一位富有誘惑性的小姐，張國華就這樣耽迷於肉的誘惑中</p>
<p>嚴玉瑛因生活的壓迫，她去工作了可憐她還在思念她的表哥。不久她病了。張國華此時已被那位富有誘惑性的小姐感覺到厭倦驅逐出去，他恨極了結果槍殺了她，自首入獄，同時她的表妹也因病而死。全劇就這樣結束</p>
<p>意識怎樣。我現在不多談，據我知道這部片子的技巧是有相當的貢獻的</p>

<h3>羅宫春色TbeSignoftheCrossb（四）</h3>
<p>— 凜</p>
<p>大家贊成馬可　的　議，　看安喀利亞有什麽本領可以使馬茜亞冰　的心温暖温來。安喀利亞想用歌唱舞蹈去打動她的心。但是馬茜亞看了頗爲侷促不安。這時外面監禁基督徒的獄中，忽然亦發出悲壯快樂的歌聲。這種視死如歸的樂處，實使一般羅馬人，連馬可斯在内　聽了惶惑不解。他吩咐安喀利亞唱得再　些，要將她的歌聲鎭壓那『斜敎』中的讚美上帝的歌聲，但是外面的歌聲越來越雄壯，至終將安喀利亞嚇得逃下樓去。賓客們亦統通下樓去了樓上仍舊剩馬可斯馬茜亞二人。馬可斯再想動以男女的愛情。他緊緊抱著她。他吻著她她亦不能加以拒絶，但是她仍舊堅持她的信仰，要馬可斯將她送回監獄去　這時候提其理納斯，已經將馬可斯的行徑奏明了尼羅。尼羅　躁如雷，立時要將馬可斯處死。但是皇后室比亞很好僞地動導皇帝，她說馬可斯是忠心的，祇要把那基督徒的女子處死就好了。所以尼羅就命提其理納斯帶了兵，來到馬可斯的府邸，將馬茜亞生生地從馬可斯的懷抱中攫了去。馬可斯因爲那是皇帝的勅令，所以不敢違抗</p>
<p>那天晚上，馬可斯心如刀割，　夜無眠。翌日一早，因爲那天下午竸技塲中，賽完各種竸騎角力等等；就是將活人喂獅虎猛獸的一齣　軸戲。那時馬茜亞亦不免一死，所以馬可斯不得已跑到尼羅面前去求特赦，尼羅是極信任馬可斯的，雖然因爲他袒護　督徒而發怒，亦是因爲提其理納斯屢次進　的原故。現在旣然馬可斯來面求，就頗有從輕發落之意。不過皇后　比亞從中作梗，屢次阻當尼羅，不許輕赦馬茜亞。她說這種赦免基督敎徒的事　　不是忠心的臣僕所應當求的。可是馬可斯說</p>
<p>我就求這一點，但是，陛下，你不能說我没有忠心。皇后，你難道還不知道我對尼羅的忠心嗎』？馬可斯又向尼羅求，他說『尼羅皇帝，我有求這一些小恩典的權利。我已服從你　榮耀你，爲你東征西討，犧牲命都不足惜。難道這一些小東西，一個女子的生命，她是我心愛的，惟一心愛的，你不賜給我嗎？』馬可斯的聲音悲慘極了，尼羅鐵石的心腸亦爲動搖了。但是，那婦人，實比亞，她的蛇蝎的心腸，是堅持不動搖的。她斜睨着尼羅，表示不可的意思，所以尼羅從新硬了心腸，對馬可斯說『這是不可能的。我不能爲了一個女子，使野蠻人非笑羅馬的法律，若要我救她，除非她肯當了大衆否認她的信仰不可</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan's Troops Recapture the High Ground on the Main Peak of Xifengkou</h3>
<p>Fierce fighting at Luowenyu yesterday morning, enemy cavalry at Dongjiakou defeated and retreated, remnants at Panjiakou being eliminated. Enemy burned and looted villages outside the passes, massacring over a thousand people.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed from Xifengkou that the high ground on the main peak of Xifengkou was occupied by our Wang Zhibang Brigade on the evening of the 14th. Enemy forces at Dongjiakou, Tiemenguan on the right flank, and the high ground at Panjiakou on the left flank are being eliminated. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. According to a telephone call from Xifengkou at 2 AM this morning, Japanese troops launched an attack on our Luowenyu, engaging our forces in combat. The fighting is extremely fierce. Our troops' morale is high. Waiting for the enemy to approach, they shouted and charged, causing the Japanese to scatter. Our powerful reinforcements have been continuously arriving. Our vanguard outside Xifengkou has already entered the new positions at Luowenyu. Yesterday, enemy troops invaded villages such as Dawancun in front of our positions, burning down houses in various villages and massacring over a thousand civilians, a truly unbearable tragedy. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Eleven enemy planes flew over Xifengkou yesterday, dropping bombs. Our soldiers, under the cover of anti-aircraft guns, continued to construct fortifications as usual. There was no contact between the two armies yesterday. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. According to a telephone call from Zunhua, enemy cavalry launched a fierce attack on our Dongjiakou and Tiemenguan last night. Our Tong Zeguang Brigade met them head-on and fought fiercely until after 1 AM this morning, finally defeating the enemy. Also, the enemy's Hattori Brigade Headquarters, located on a high mountain, has been surrounded by our troops and is about to be eliminated. The enemy is preparing to break out of the encirclement and retreat. Our troops have made thorough preparations. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. This morning, the enemy used nine infantry companies, one cavalry company, and four flat-trajectory guns to cover an attack on our Luowenyu position. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. The enemy at Xiaoling and Baitaizi outside Xifengkou is surrounded by us but still resists stubbornly. Xianjinkou has been occupied by our troops. On the nights of the 13th and mornings of the 14th, our troops engaged in melee combat with the surrounded enemy several times. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Enemy planes have been active near various key locations inside the pass for several days. From the 14th, bombs were dropped on Cheheqiao and Shouwangfen, only destroying a few civilian houses. Our troops suffered no losses. Merchants and civilians in Zunhua, Wangtian, and other counties have prepared air defense facilities and vowed to live and die together with our troops. Because the Xifengkou battle failed, the enemy transferred troops from Chengde southward to reinforce, with approximately 2,000 infantry and cavalry advancing south through Yingshouying, intending to attack our Malanguan. Our troops have dispatched elite forces to intercept them. The enemy cavalry company outside Dongjiakou has now been surrounded by troops dispatched by Song's forces and are being eliminated. Over ninety horses were captured. It is reported that the main force of the enemy near Gubeikou has retreated towards Chengde. Currently, there are approximately one enemy regiment and over 2,000 puppet troops outside the pass. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. One Japanese plane flew from outside the pass to Zunhua on the 15th for reconnaissance. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Commander Feng Zhian telegraphed to Beiping from the front lines of Xifengkou this morning, reporting that the enemy on the main peak of Xifengkou showed signs of retreating, while simultaneously withdrawing a portion of their forces to attack the Luowenyu position, intending to cut off our communications and isolate our Xifengkou forces. However, two divisions of our troops in Zunhua have repelled the enemy. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Today, personnel returning to Beiping from Xifengkou stated that the battle situation had calmed down since the 14th, and the enemy no longer had the ability to counterattack. On the 14th, planes came to bomb our positions, only killing one head of livestock. Now the enemy has begun to retreat. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. A certain source received a telegram from Commander [redacted] of Song's forces in Shimentun on the 13th, stating that since our troops took over the defense of Xifengkou from Wan's forces on the afternoon of the 9th, before the handover was complete, the enemy launched a fierce attack with two brigades, over twenty field guns, and dozens of armored vehicles. After three days and nights of bloody battle and dozens of melee combats, fortunately, our officers and soldiers fought bravely, all determined to fight to the death. On the 11th, we launched a counterattack in multiple directions. Our Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu was wounded but did not retreat, bypassing the enemy's rear and burning their supplies and ammunition, killing five or six hundred enemies, and capturing six field guns and a great deal of military equipment. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. In addition to sending Regiment Commander Li Zengzhi with a mixed regiment to join the fighting at the front, the rest of our forces are defending key points along the Hongshankou, Daankou, and Malanguan lines. Although the enemy is stubborn, they will likely not succeed. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing. I have received two telegrams sent by Song Zheyuan on the 14th as follows: (1) The enemy around Xifengkou has been severely battered by us for days, and is extremely exhausted. On the night of the 13th, they continuously fired at our positions, showing panic and inability to sustain. The enemy, with a combined Mongolian and Korean force of approximately two regiments, snuck from Dongjiakou to Yujiagu, where they were met head-on and attacked by our so-and-so Brigade. They were then attacked from the left flank, and were repelled. After days of bloody battle, the enemy has suffered too many casualties and is demoralized. According to a telephone report from Commander Feng, the enemy attacking Xifengkou retreated at 10 AM, showing signs of retreat. (2) The enemy on the high ground on the main peak of our Xifengkou position was severely battered by us and collapsed backward near dusk. The high ground has now been completely occupied by our [redacted] Brigade. A small number of enemy soldiers are stubbornly resisting on the high ground on the northwest side of our defense, and are being surrounded by our [redacted] Regiment. Enemy infantry and cavalry units are advancing around our left flank in the Dongjiakou and Tiemenguan area, and are being dealt with separately by our Tong Brigade. According to a Japanese source who fled from Pinghong to Panjiakou, large numbers of enemy supply vehicles and wounded soldiers were being transported to the rear day and night. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan's Bloody Battle Against the Enemy</h3>
<h3>Enemy at Malanyu Repelled</h3>
<p>Beiping. According to a telephone call from Zunhua, over three hundred enemy soldiers were discovered in Malanyu, northeast of Jixian County, at 10 PM last night, attempting to disturb the rear positions of our Xifengkou. They were met head-on and repelled by the Liu Regiment stationed there. This group of enemy soldiers seems to have snuck in from inside Yuguan. Enemy spies have been discovered in Tiechang, Yutian, and other locations within Zunhua County. Our troops on the left flank have taken separate precautions. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements of 30,000 Arrive in Chengde</h3>
<p>Beiping. According to a telephone call from Xifengkou, it is widely rumored that the enemy has transferred Suzuki, Hattori, and Yu Zhishan's rebel troops, totaling over 30,000, from Pingquan, and they arrived in Chengde on the 14th. Three more squadrons of planes, totaling twenty-four, have been added to Suizhong, intending to attack Xifengkou. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang's Telegram to Song Zheyuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Zhang Zhijiang telegraphed Song Zheyuan on the 16th, saying that he was overjoyed upon hearing the news of victory. The enemy has suffered a major blow and will certainly fight like a cornered beast. You and your comrades have bravely killed the enemy, enduring hardships and adding glory to the country, bringing honor to the military. I am deeply impressed. I regret that I cannot be with you in the army to share hardships and dangers. I have already telegraphed to request permission to serve, to do my duty as a soldier. If granted, I will travel north as quickly as possible, and perhaps witness you and your men shout and defeat the enemy. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Transfers Large Forces to Avenge Humiliation</h3>
<p>Beiping. The Japanese military considers the Xifengkou battle to be the greatest humiliation since the Meiji training reforms. They have recently transferred a large force from Japan, which has arrived in Zhongzhuang and will soon be heading to Rehe to launch a large-scale attack to avenge the humiliation. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy at Jielingkou Encircled</h3>
<p>Enemy Fiercely Attacks Our Defense Line, Luohandong Once Lost, Our Reinforcements Bravely Charge, Immediately Recapturing Original Position. The enemy at Luohandong, west of Jielingkou, Linyu, was led by our reinforcement team [redacted] Regiment Commander on the afternoon of the 16th, who took the lead and charged bravely, killing most of the enemy, who retreated in disarray.

<p>Linyu. The enemy at Jielingkou has been surrounded by our troops on both sides and is being eliminated. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Linyu. Around noon today, the enemy who infiltrated our rear at [redacted] launched a fierce attack on us, suffering heavy artillery fire. At the same time, Luohandong was occupied by the enemy, and the enemy was also approaching the top of Jielingkou, making the situation extremely critical. Our [redacted] Division Commander has dispatched [redacted] two regiments to reinforce and retake Jielingkou and other locations. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Jielingkou, once lost this morning, has been retaken. Luohandong, next to Jielingkou, has also been retaken. Our troops are pursuing the enemy. Our troops are also pursuing the enemy near Zunhua. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu. Since 7 AM this morning, three to four hundred enemy soldiers with over ten cannons have launched a fierce attack on our position at Luohandong, west of Jielingkou. At the same time, approximately one thousand enemy soldiers have been discovered between Jielingkou and Jianganling. Fierce fighting has continued until 10 AM. The enemy's artillery fire is particularly intense. Our troops have suffered considerable casualties, but their morale is extremely high. Even under the enemy's incendiary bombs, they have not flinched and are fighting against the enemy in front of them. Unexpectedly, the [redacted] area near the [redacted] unit in [redacted] has also been infiltrated by the enemy. Our [redacted] team has advanced to reinforce and is engaged in fierce fighting. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. He Zhuguo telegraphed to Beiping today that the enemy at Yiyuankou has been repelled by our troops. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. The enemy at Dongbanchangyu, Yiyuankou, was cleared out on the 14th. Our troops are still defending their original positions. The enemy has again used a part of their force to encircle Banchangyu, and are now confronting us in the Chengziyu and Damaoshankou area. The main force of the Japanese army is now gathering in the Mingshuitangmen area, preparing to reinforce various locations outside the passes.

<h3>Japanese Army Makes a Show of Force at Gubeikou, Our Fresh Troops Counterattack</h3>
<p>Left and right wings advance over ten li.</p>
<p>Beiping. After our army's great victory at Xifengkou, most of the Japanese troops at Gubeikou rushed to reinforce, leaving few behind. However, the Japanese army made a show of force, hanging electric lights all over the trees at night to create a false impression. After our army detected this, it launched a fierce attack. Our left and right wings advanced over ten li. The enemy has now retreated outside the pass. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Military News: Because the enemy army's battle lines outside the pass are too long, our army has decided to take a defensive posture on the main front of Gubeikou, and has transferred certain units to attack the enemy's flank from a certain pass. A major battle will take place soon. Due to the failure in the Great Wall battle, Mutō has decided to increase two divisions to aid the Japanese army's attack and will personally go to Jinzhou to command. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Military News: The enemy's supplies at Gubeikou have been transported to the rear since the 15th. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. According to a telephone call from Shixiazhen, the enemy outside Gubeikou is still actively constructing defensive works to prevent our counterattack. There were repeated small-scale battles on the front lines yesterday. It seems that they are replenishing their forces. There was no sign of an attack yesterday. Our Huang Jie Division has all entered the [redacted] position on the front line and will soon begin a counterattack outside Gubeikou. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. According to people from Miyun, our army is firmly defending the Qing Shiliang lines at Gubeikou, and their morale is high, all determined to die. The enemy army recently bombed Gubeikou and Shixia with planes, causing panic among shopkeepers and residents, but most were able to calm down and support the war effort against Japan. A certain street in Gubeikou suffered heavy damage due to the bombing because it housed the radio station, telegraph bureau, and supply depot. Other streets were less damaged. The bombing in Shixiazhen only targeted the road outside the city, as it was intended to obstruct our rear transportation. Therefore, they spared no expense in using heavy bombs to destroy the road between Gubeikou and Miyun, but our engineering battalion stationed in Shixiazhen worked extremely quickly, repairing the road as soon as it was bombed, and there was no disruption to transportation. Residents in the Shixia area volunteered to join the rescue effort and transport supplies. However, there have been many refugees from the front lines in recent days, and shops are still operating as usual. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Encouraging Frontline Soldiers · Ji</h3>
<p>Since the Rehe army retreated without a fight, allowing the Japanese army to advance rapidly and their iron hooves to trample the entire Rehe province in a matter of days, the arrogant enemy was high-spirited and boasted that the speed of this battle was a new record in history. But now they have suffered extremely heroic and tragic desperate struggles from our country and have admitted to being caught in a difficult struggle.</p>
<p>According to daily dispatches, our Song Zheyuan, Wang Yizhe, Sun Dianying, Guan Linzheng, and other units, are all fighting with a determination to die, bathing in blood. Commander Guan Linzheng personally supervised the battle and was wounded in five places. The Song, Wang, and Sun units also suffered extremely heavy casualties. However, they share a common hatred and regard death as going home. They fight fiercely in close combat, and try again and again, finally inflicting heavy damage on the strong enemy, making them dare not look each other in the eye. This tragic and difficult struggle should be recorded in our national history alongside the heroic Shanghai battle against Japan in 1932, shining forever. The loyal and brave soldiers standing on the front line of our national revolutionary struggle should especially receive the admiration, love, and worship of our entire nation.</p>
<p>In today's situation, the arrival of the violent enemy is like a storm. If our nation is unwilling to sit and wait to be slaughtered, then there is absolutely no room for retreat or seeking temporary safety.</p>
<p>Only by unfolding the banner of national revolutionary war and uniting the entire nation to fight desperately can we stop the aggression of Japanese imperialism and fight for our nation's survival and freedom. We have repeatedly said this. Therefore, today, those who can stand on the front line of the national revolutionary struggle and resist the violent aggression of the Japanese army are recognized by us as the national military force, the revolutionary military force. The people of the whole country should unite to support them. Conversely, those who eat the people's food, wear the people's clothes, and accept the people's offerings, yet do not defend their land or resist insults, are considered by us to be traitors to the country. Tragic are our loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines. In the bitter cold of the border, in the snow and ice, they face the stubborn Japanese invaders with crude military equipment, risking their lives, fighting in close combat with blades. Their unwavering loyalty is enough to move heaven and earth, and make ghosts and gods weep. Their blue blood on the battlefield and white bones among the weeds are enough to compete with the sun and moon for glory. Since the loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines have already created their indelible glory, will our national army and people rise up to trample on the blood of the dead and advance?</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, with each bloody resistance, the people of the country place their most fervent hopes, but are soon disappointed, because no one continues the effort. Now that the national revolutionary war has begun, the urgent task is to implement an overall plan and take overall action. In other words, we must mobilize the entire nation and prepare for a protracted struggle. If we continue to resist the enemy's full-scale invasion with local resistance, with one part of the country resisting while another looks on, without the determination to fight or the ability to support, then the most likely outcome is to be misled by the idea of seeking temporary safety, believing that since Rehe has been lost, the Great Wall can be a natural barrier, and the Japanese will be satisfied, and that Tianjin and Beiping can be safe. This kind of mentality is like poison for our country. Therefore, while encouraging the loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines, we especially hope that our government and people will make a final determination to resist, and not let this tragic sacrifice be in vain.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Luo Discusses Unchanging Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Jiang Zuobin Arrives in Beiping to Visit Luo and He</p>
<p>Beiping. After Luo Wengan and Liu Chongjie returned to Beiping on the evening of the 14th, they discussed matters with He Yingqin and others at the Beijing Hotel for a long time. At 10 AM on the morning of the 15th, Luo met with the ambassadors of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil, and the chargés d'affaires of Italy and Belgium at the Foreign Affairs Building, and briefly reported on the Chinese government's diplomatic policy and current situation. Luo stated to the ambassadors that China is responsible for protecting foreign nationals in Beiping and Tianjin. However, due to Japan's extreme ambition and military aggression, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not disrupt Beiping and Tianjin. There is a possibility of serious developments at any time. Please pay attention, and said that if Japan destroys peace, all responsibility should be borne by Japan. The ambassadors were very satisfied with the talks and left after about an hour. At 2 PM, our ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, arrived in Beiping from Baoding. After getting off the train, he went to the Beijing Hotel and talked briefly with Luo, Liu, and others, and then went to Jurentang to visit He Yingqin and talk about his visit to Chiang in Baoding. On the morning of the 16th, reporters visited Luo to inquire about recent diplomatic trends and the situation of the meetings with the ambassadors. According to Luo, my meetings with the ambassadors and chargés d'affaires yesterday and today were ordinary social engagements and did not involve any important diplomatic issues. Our country's diplomatic policy will not change. Because we trust the League of Nations and have accepted the League of Nations report, all issues will proceed according to the report. I do not know where the talk of direct negotiations comes from. My trip north is not for a mission of direct negotiations. Military matters, regardless of victory or defeat, will not change our diplomatic policy. Chairman Chiang's military actions are consistent with my diplomatic policy. Although there are many rumors, they are not credible. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: After the Japanese army in Tianjin sent us the fourth absurd note, the situation in North China became increasingly serious. Luo Wengan left Beiping early in the morning of the 16th and went to Baoding to visit Chiang Kai-shek and discuss countermeasures. It is said that he will delay his return to Nanjing for a day or two. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping. Foreign Minister Luo returned to Baoding this morning. It is rumored that Luo received an important telegram from Geneva last night, so he must continue to discuss with Military Affairs Chairman Chiang. It is expected that Foreign Minister Luo will come to Beiping once more before returning to Nanjing. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Foreign Minister Luo Wengan arrived in Tianjin from Beiping by special train at 6:30 PM on the 16th and visited Gan Xuezhong to talk for a long time. He scheduled to take the Pingpu train with Jiang Zuobin at 10 PM to return to Nanjing. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>United States Begins Cooperation with League of Nations</h3>
<p>Implementation Method for Non-Recognition of Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>Question of Prohibiting Arms Shipments to the Far East</p>
<p>Advisory Committee Studies in Groups</p>
<p>Geneva. Today, the United States began cooperating with the League of Nations Advisory Committee. Its representative, Wilson, has been invited to attend as an observer without voting rights. After the Advisory Committee met, it first discussed the United States' reply. After it was passed, it immediately voted to invite Wilson to attend. Then Secretary-General Drummond immediately went to the Secretary-General's office to invite Wilson to come. Afterwards, the committee organized two subcommittees. One group considered the proposal to ban arms shipments to the Far East, and the other group considered the implementation method for the League of Nations' refusal to recognize "Manchukuo." There was no discussion of the Japanese military actions in Rehe. No one raised the question of whether the arms embargo was directed at one country or at both sides of the Manchurian case. After the members of each subcommittee were elected, the Advisory Committee adjourned. U.S. Representative Wilson was also elected to join the subcommittee studying the issue of banning arms shipments. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Geneva. The twenty-one-member Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute met at 3:30 PM today and lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes. After the meeting accepted the U.S. government's reply, a staff member invited U.S. Representative Wilson, who was waiting upstairs, to attend. Wilson arrived and the crowd cheered. They then discussed the issue of the chairman. The chairman of the former Nineteenth Special Committee, the Belgian representative Hymans, is no longer in Geneva, and his position is being temporarily filled by the Belgian representative Boelke. Boelke repeatedly stated that Belgium did not want to continue serving as chairman and suggested that the position should be filled by a representative of a major country. The Swiss representative Motta suggested that the major countries should take turns as chairman, but Britain and France were not prepared to accept the above two suggestions. As a result, the Norwegian representative Lange was elected chairman. At this point, the committee discussed the ways in which the U.S. representative could cooperate. Because the U.S. representative, in accordance with the U.S. government's decision, will not participate in voting, the committee then discussed the issue of arms shipments to the Far East. At the suggestion of British representative Eden, a subcommittee was appointed on the spot to study the matter. The powers of this subcommittee are very broad and unlimited. Although the issue of the arms embargo has been discussed, it has not proceeded. Irish representative Lester suggested that appropriate actions should be studied based on Paragraph 3 of the recommendations proposed by the Nineteenth Special Committee regarding issues arising from the major powers' non-recognition of "Manchukuo." The League of Nations has apparently received a petition from "Manchukuo" to join the Postal and Telegraph and International Radio Alliance, and the issues of passports, stamps, and the status of consuls stationed in Manchuria will follow. To inspect this and related issues, the twenty-one-member committee decided to appoint a second subcommittee. The second subcommittee will study this matter and then propose a plan to the twenty-one-member committee. The first subcommittee consists of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, eleven countries. The second subcommittee consists of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Ireland, Turkey, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Mexico, and Norway, twelve countries.

<p>Tokyo. The Japanese Privy Council reopened its deliberations on withdrawing from the League of Nations at 1:30 PM today in the palace. First, Prime Minister Saitō and Foreign Minister Uchida explained the process and stated the Japanese government's established plan. Questions from various parties began at 2 PM. The scope of the questions involved issues such as direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, the issue of sovereignty over the South Pacific Islands, the issue of military aggression in Rehe, the issue of East Asian peace, and issues of international politics and diplomacy. Because the content of the questions and answers is kept strictly confidential, it is impossible to ascertain. It is expected that the third deliberation will begin again tomorrow. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 PM. (16th China Allied Telegram)</p>

<h3>Chiang Plans to Inspect Beiping</h3>

<p>Huang Musong, a staff member of the Nanjing Military Council, was summoned by Chairman Chiang to consult. On the 16th, he and Gao Changzhu, who had just returned from inspecting the Northwest National Defense in Qinghai, traveled together to Baoding. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Twelve members of the delegation from all circles in Beiping and Beiping City, welcoming Chairman Chiang, including Yu Shiyuan, arrived in Baoding on the morning of the 15th. Around 10 AM, they met with Chiang to express their welcome and offer several suggestions. Chiang indicated his acceptance but, due to being busy, did not discuss them in detail. He sent Yang Yongtai and He Jingwu to entertain them separately and engage in detailed conversations. The gist was that the central government's diplomatic policy had long been determined and would not be changed. There was an overall plan for resolutely resisting Japan, and the various rumors circulating outside were entirely baseless. It should be known that the facts would prove the determination to resist Japan. Thirty years ago, there was a Li Hongzhang who signed treaties that ceded territory and humiliated the nation, but there would never be another Li Hongzhang. In the future, various groups could find ways to consolidate the rear, comfort the soldiers at the front, and boost morale. The delegation returned to Beiping on the morning of the 16th.

<h3>Salt Transport on the Banks of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui to Be Changed to Shipping</h3>
<p>Representatives of Boatmen Petition in Nanjing</p>
<p>For salt transport on the banks of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui, sailing ships have been used from Twelve Forts, Jiangsu for nearly a century without change. The continuous prosperity has made it one of the largest types of inland river sailing, with over 2,000 ships, assets of 20 million taels, and over 300,000 people relying on it for a living. Later, because merchants changed to shipping, many small boats were eliminated, larger ships were rebuilt, and tugboats were hired. Now, because the Ministry of Finance has issued a clear order to promote shipping, the shipowners and boatmen of Twelve Forts, believing that the government's sudden change of system will inevitably cause hundreds of thousands of boatmen to be unemployed and their livelihoods impossible to maintain, have sent representatives Xu Haishan, Li Shaoquan, and others to Nanjing to petition the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, and the three ministries of Finance, Industry, and Communications, hoping that before the government changes to shipping, it will provide a reasonable time for them to calmly adapt and deal with it. For sailing ships, it should be limited to adding new ones, so that after several years, the old ships will gradually decrease, so that the shipowners with tens of millions of capital will not face the danger of being overthrown overnight.

<p>Macdonald to Meet Mussolini in Rome</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 16th - This afternoon, the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference convened. Before the meeting, the public gathered outside the venue to await the arrival of the representatives. When British Prime Minister Macdonald and French Premier Daladier arrived, the crowd cheered to welcome them. The British Prime Minister then put forward a major disarmament plan, saying that the methods of researching disarmament in various parts have been exhausted. Now we hear the sound of the cultural structure breaking. Chairman Henderson once said that if Germany is not given fairness and freedom, Europe will be destroyed. The two must be one. This statement is true. Please express goodwill and trust to each other to make disarmament a success.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 16th - French Premier Daladier and British Prime Minister Macdonald met, with British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour in attendance. The talks lasted from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Macdonald explained the outline of his declaration to the French cabinet members. This declaration will be issued by the British Prime Minister at the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference in the afternoon. The content is a summary of the draft disarmament convention, the full text of which will be announced simultaneously in Geneva and London tonight. Macdonald's speech at the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will be broadcast by radio at 3:45 p.m. Macdonald and Simon will leave Geneva on Friday afternoon, take a train to Genoa, Italy, where Italian Air Minister General Balbo will meet them and travel together by plane to Rome.

These three pieces of news have all been released, so today's situation is extremely important. It is reported that the convention draft Macdonald intends to propose is 43 pages thick, divided into 15 chapters and 53 articles. Simon briefly told Paul-Boncour the content of the draft. Macdonald and Paul-Boncour both kept silent. Macdonald only told the British press that the plan he intended to propose was general in nature. Macdonald himself only wanted a gradually implemented disarmament plan, not to achieve immediate results. The content of the plan is also taken from the files of the Disarmament Conference, so the French plan is also included in the selection. Macdonald's intention is not to take a different path. According to those who have seen the British draft, France and Germany may not be able to accept it. Tomorrow, several delegations will propose to suspend the work of the Disarmament Conference for eight days so that the governments of various countries can study Macdonald's plan at their leisure. Macdonald informed Paul-Boncour last night of his intention to go to Rome. This matter is in line with France's proposed European cooperation plan, so France can only express its pleasure at the British Prime Minister's trip to Rome.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 15th - British Prime Minister Macdonald's new disarmament plan has been scheduled to be announced on Thursday at the Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference. It is said that it is divided into two major parts, totaling 40 pages. The first part is to guarantee the Kellogg-Briand Pact as the basis, not to use force to resolve disputes, and to propose that Mediterranean countries conclude mutual assistance treaties. The second part combines previous British, French, and Hoover proposals, organizes them, and proposes to reduce military strength by one-third, prohibit all chemical and microbial warfare, abolish air warfare, reduce military spending, limit tanks to no more than 20 tons, and local army heavy artillery to no more than seven inches. This draft convention is scheduled to be effective for five years, and will be revised at any time thereafter.

Conservative Party member Bo Zibi also said during the debate on economic events that the British government must strive for economic cooperation with the United States. If it involves the restoration of the gold standard, we can also agree to it, as long as the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department can cooperate to guarantee its efficiency.

<p>Havas, Washington, 15th - Secretary of State Hull will soon discuss the World Economic Conference and war debt issues with British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay. There is no talk of Hull meeting with French Ambassador Claudel at present. In Hull's view, the method to solve the world's panic can be found in the agenda of the World Economic Conference proposed by the United States and the motion passed by the Chicago Democratic National Convention on June 27 last year. This method is (1) exchange rate equilibrium (2) silver price recovery (3) tariff agreements based on mutual conditions. When all three are in place, international trade can be revived. The State Department will present this economic plan to all relevant countries, and intends to try to conclude tariff agreements with those countries based on mutual conditions before the World Economic Conference is held.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 15th - The fact that Britain refused to adopt the same attitude as France to protest against the actions of the German National Socialist Party's special police has now been confirmed by the Echo de Paris. The newspaper's London correspondent reported that when French Ambassador Fleuriau went to the British Foreign Office to request Britain to take joint action with France, the British authorities told him that Britain did not consider the actions of the German National Socialist Party in the Rhineland area to be provocative, and therefore it was only a matter of German internal affairs. In addition, the Petit Parisien carried a news item from Geneva stating that Italian representative Aloisi had discussed with British Prime Minister Macdonald the French protest to Germany. The Italian representative said that even if Britain and France took unified action, Italy would not agree, because Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believed that the German government had already issued a statement regarding the Kerr incident, and this matter could be considered over. As for the National Socialist Party members being incorporated into the special police, it was caused by the domestic revolutionary situation in Germany. The necessity of two thirds. This is the main difficulty the government will encounter.

Rosenberg was a loyal supporter of the old Russian Tsar, and now he is a zealous patriot of Germany. He is trying to awaken the old plan carried out by the Baltic princes after the defeat of the Tsar. The only invasion of the Soviet Union in 1918 had the full support of German imperialism, and today's plan is probably only supported by people like Rosenberg.</p>

This bill gives the government broad dictatorial powers for many years, but the passage of this bill requires a two-thirds majority in Congress. Even though there is no Communist Party in Congress now, the National Socialist Party government may not be able to obtain two-thirds due to absenteeism. Because changes to the constitution require not only the consent of two-thirds of the members present, but also the attendance of one-third of all members. Dr. Luther, President of the National Bank, may resign this afternoon. It is heard that the public plan proposed by the government, with the aim of revitalizing trade and settling the unemployed, requires 2,000,000,000 marks. Dr. Luther can only agree to a limit of 850,000,000 marks and cannot agree with the government, so he will resign. His successor will be Dr. Schacht, the former President of the National Bank.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th - Broadcasting, newspapers, movie theaters, and public education will all be managed by Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda and Public Culture. Goebbels told newspaper representatives today that newspapers still have the right to criticize, but they must make criticisms that are beneficial to the government. Electoral districts that did not vote for National Socialist Party members in the past, accounting for 48 percent of all electoral districts, will not be subjected to intimidation, but will be subjected to propaganda. The discipline and determination of this revolution are unprecedented. Those who complain about personal grievances should be happy that things have not worsened.</p>

<h3>German Newspapers Approve of Rejecting French Protest</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th - Today, the German morning newspapers are extremely satisfied with Foreign Minister Neurath's resolute rejection of the French ambassador's protest, and generally recognize that France's unilateral objection is an unreasonable interference in German internal affairs. They also refuted France's view that the actions of German National Socialist Party members violated Article 48 of the Treaty of Versailles. Ordinary newspapers said that Article 48 of the treaty had been read several times, but they could not find the reason why Germany's formation of special police could enable France to lodge a protest. Local newspapers said that France had been criticized by various countries in Geneva, so it wanted to use the Kerr incident to lodge a protest in order to divert the world's attention.</p>

<h3>The Ins and Outs of the Jehol Anti-Japanese War (Part 4)</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Jehol is the northern barrier of North China, with its terrain being rugged and dangerous. Historically, invasions into China have often started from here. The past is a clear reminder. After the Japanese bandits forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, they harbored ulterior motives to invade Jehol. Their invasion plan was based on Tongliao and Suizhong as base camps. They first mobilized a large army, and then divided it into three routes to invade: the northern route to Chifeng, the southern route to Lingnan, and the central route to Chaoyang. In total, their forces included the Third and Tenth Divisions of the Japanese Army, and the puppet troops of Zhang Hai Peng, Yu Zhi Shan, Shao Ben Liang, etc., numbering over 100,000, with more than 40 aircraft, several hundred tanks and armored vehicles, and several dozen field and mountain guns, as well as 800 transport vehicles. Their most effective weapons were the flying tanks and armored vehicles. The flying tanks are well known to the world. The armored vehicles were light, convenient armored trains, shaped like several linked locomotives, forming a train of four or five cars connected, each car higher than the last, each equipped with light artillery and machine guns. They could travel at high speeds, climb mountains, and cross trenches freely. This newly invented weapon of the Japanese army caused countless casualties among the anti-Japanese soldiers. Our defense forces included the Jehol Army, the Volunteer Army, the 9th Brigade of the Northeast Army, and the 1st Division of Shen Ke, and the two divisions of Sun Yan Ying. These forces were divided into three routes to fight: the northern route around Kailu, defended by the Jehol Army's Cui Xing Wu cavalry and the Volunteer Armies of Feng Zhan Hai, Liu Zhen Dong, Li Hai Qing, and Deng Wen, stationed in Chifeng on the Kailu road, and Sun Dian Ying led his division to defend it. Cui's brigade was only cavalry, with weak combat power. The Motegi cavalry advanced rapidly, directly attacking Chifeng. Sun's army had just arrived, and the position was not yet secure. The retreating troops collided, and the Japanese army followed closely behind, catching them off guard. The line was broken. While planning to recover Chengde, it fell again, cutting off the rear. The isolated army fought bravely, but could not stem the tide. The central route of Chaoyang, Nanling, and Beipiao was defended by the Jehol Army's Dong Fu Ting Brigade. Lingyuan and Pingquan were defended by Wan Fu Lin, leading the Northeast Army's Yu Zhao Lin and Wang Yong Sheng divisions. Wan's headquarters was located in Pingquan, with Wang's division and the guard stationed there, and Yu's division stationed in Lingyuan to support the Chaoyang route. Dong Fu Ting's strategy was poor, and he used favoritism, forcing his subordinate regiment commander Shao Ben Liang to defect. Shao surrendered to the puppet state, serving as a puppet division commander, acting as an accomplice to the tiger, using the slogan of "overthrowing Dong Fu Ting" to lure Dong's troops. Shao had a good relationship with the soldiers and locals. After the outbreak of the war, Dong's troops were lured into a mutiny, and Nanling, Beipiao, and Chaoyang fell without a fight. The Japanese army directly attacked Lingyuan on one side, and attacked Lingnan from the side. Yu's army fought bravely in the Lingyuan Yebaishou area, but suffered more than half their casualties due to the disparity in numbers and weapons, and the city fell. After Lingyuan was lost, the Japanese bandits directly fought Wang Yong Sheng's division in Pingquan, while also sending a surprise attack on Chengde from Jianping. Tang Yu Lin panicked upon hearing the news and did not make any defense plans. Instead, he packed up his valuables and fled in the night with his guards. Zhang Zuo Xiang retreated to Gubeikou. The provincial capital of Jehol was surrendered to the enemy without a fight, and the frontline troops were shaken, and the situation was completely changed. The southern route of Lingnan and the Shaomao Mountain area was defended by the divisions of Ding Xi Chun, Sun De Quan, and Miao Zheng Liu. The Lengkou area was supported by Shen Ke's division. The Japanese army repeatedly attacked Shaomao Mountain without success, suffering heavy casualties. Later, affected by the central route, the position was shaken. The enemy attacked Lingnan. Ding and Miao's divisions bravely fought back, killing many enemies, but ultimately lost two-thirds of their forces due to the superior power of the enemy's aircraft and armored vehicles, and retreated to the Lamadong area. Ding Xi Chun took refuge in the mountains and was cut off from communication, so it was rumored for a time that he was missing. Miao Zheng Liu only led dozens of guards and traveled south along the river to Leizhuang (one station west of Chuzhou) and returned to Beiping. After the fall of Chengde, the various armies concentrated on one side and mobilized troops to reinforce on the other, preparing for a counterattack. Sun Dian Ying's troops on the northern route concentrated around Weichang, awaiting orders to advance or retreat. They have now been ordered to advance south and establish contact with the main force, and are currently making progress. Reinforcements are also coming from Chahar. The eastern armies, commanded by Wan Fu Lin, are concentrated in the Sanjiazi Kuancheng area, confronting the enemy. On the western route on the Ping-Re road, the Northeast Army's Wang Yi Zhe, Zhang Ting Shu, and others are defending Gubeikou, Qingshiliangzi, and other places. The enemy has repeatedly advanced in the past eight days, but has not succeeded. After Zhang Xue Liang stepped down, the Northeast armies were withdrawn from the front line. Wan Fu Lin, Zhang Zuo Xiang, and others returned separately. The Xifengkou area is now defended by Song Zhe Yuan's troops. The Gubeikou area is now joined in the battle by the central armies of Huang Jie and Guan Lin. On the tenth, the Japanese army launched a full-scale attack. In the Gubeikou area, fierce fighting took place for two days. The solid positions in the Qingshiliang Sanjianfang area were broken through by the enemy. Division Commander Guan was wounded and lost four or five thousand men. Although our army fought bravely to kill the enemy in the midst of the crisis, capturing many prisoners, on the night of the eleventh, the enemy launched another fierce attack. Street fighting broke out in Gubeikou, lasting all night. Our army has built a new line of defense at a certain location south of Gubeikou to resist the strong enemy. In the Xifengkou area, Song's troops had just arrived when the enemy attacked. Both sides fought fiercely, suffering casualties. The fighting has been extremely fierce in the past two days, and the morale of our army is very high. It is reported that over two hundred Japanese soldiers have been captured, with many weapons seized, and a dozen Japanese armored vehicles have been destroyed. As both sides hold their positions, the future of the battle will depend on the evolution of the situation. (March 13th)</p>
<h3>Chiang and Yan Meet in Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>Showing Sincerity and Candor</p>
<p>Uniting with Sincerity to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek recently went north to preside over military affairs in North China. After meeting with Zhang Xue Liang in Baoding, he returned to Shijiazhuang to meet with Yan Xi Shan. When Chiang went north from Hankou, he first telegraphed Yan and Feng Yuxiang to meet in Shijiazhuang to discuss the major plan of resisting Japan and saving the country. Yan thought that Chiang's travels were hasty and his residence was not yet determined, so he first sent the provincial chairman Xu Yong Chang to meet with Chiang to discuss the location of the Chiang-Yan meeting. At the same time, Yan ordered the Zhengtai Railway Bureau to prepare a special train to await orders. On the evening of the tenth, Yan received a telegram from Xu Yong Chang, saying that Chiang had returned to Shijiazhuang and was waiting to meet in Shijiazhuang. Yan immediately ordered all his attendants to prepare their luggage and go together. On the morning of the eleventh, Yan did go to the station with Chief of Staff Zhao Dai Wen and others. The military and political dignitaries who came to see him off were all waiting at the station. After Yan arrived at the station, he exchanged greetings with the well-wishers and boarded the train, which departed eastward at 1:30. The following personnel accompanied him: Chief of Staff Zhao Dai Wen, Independent Guard Brigade Commander Du Chun Yi, Chief of the Secretariat of the Pacification Headquarters Zeng Dun, Chief of the Military Affairs Department Lian Zhuang Qiu, and aides-de-camp and guards numbering over three hundred. It is said that the special train did not stop along the way, and arrived in Shijiazhuang at around 11:00 on the eleventh. The Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau dispatched police and military bands to guard the station. He Jing Wu, Xu Yong Chang, and others went to the station to welcome Yan and Zhao got out of the car and exchanged pleasantries with He and others, and then took a car to the Zhengtai Hotel to meet Chiang to discuss everything. After Yan left, the affairs of the Pacification Headquarters were handled separately by Chief of Staff Zhu Shou Guang, Secretary General Jia Jing De, and Aide-de-Camp Feng Peng Zhu. (March 12th)</p>
<p>Shijiazhuang Correspondence: Yan Xi Shan arrived in Shijiazhuang at 11:45 on the morning of the eleventh. Chiang's representative, Secretary General of the Headquarters Yang Yong Tai, Shanxi Chairman Xu Yong Chang, Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Zhao Pi Lian, Fu Ru Lin, Miao Pei Cheng, Director of the Zhengtai Bureau Wang Mao Gong, and Xiao Xian Ge, the representative of Song Zhe Yuan, all came to the station to welcome him. Yan got out of the car and walked out of the station. On that day, he still wore the attire of three years ago: cloth shoes and cloth socks, but his silk robe and satin mandarin jacket were slightly different from before. After Yan left the station, he first went to the Zhengtai Hotel to greet Zhang Ji and others. After leaving the hotel, he met with Chiang. Both sides were very happy to see each other, showing sincerity and candor, putting everything from the past behind them. They talked for about an hour and then returned to their residences to rest. In the afternoon, Chiang visited Yan and talked for a long time. In the evening, they had a banquet together at the Mingsheng Garden. All the party, government, and military leaders in Shijiazhuang attended. In the evening, Yan spoke to reporters very sincerely, expressing his determination to unite with sincerity and resist the enemy together. The next day was the eighth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. All circles in Shijiazhuang held a memorial service at the Shengguang Theater. Chiang, Yan, and all the Central Committee members attended. Chiang and Yan each gave speeches, all expressing sincerity. Zhang Ji and Zhang Li Sheng also spoke in succession. After the meeting, Chiang and Yan went to the Zhengtai Hotel for breakfast. At three o'clock in the afternoon, Chiang's special train went to Baoding. Yan personally went to the station to see him off and talked for another half an hour before Chiang's train left for the north. Yan's special train also traveled west for about twenty-eight minutes to return to Taiyuan. In total, Chiang and Yan met several times, and decisions were made on the overall situation in North China and major military and political plans. The satisfactory result was also expected by the general public. Because the country is in distress, unity is necessary to resist the enemy, and other things are not considered. (March 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Sends Traitors to Chahar</h3>
<p>Buying Off Bandits to Disrupt Public Security</p>
<p>The Defense of Chahar Province is Very Solid</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: After Baichengde fell, the Japanese army is again coveting Chahar Province. Dushikou in southern Chahar Province and Duolun County in the north are both entry points into Jehol. According to reliable information, the Japanese army has secretly sent many traitors to various places on the border between Jehol and Chahar to buy off bandits and disrupt public security. However, our military defense is solid and we have made considerable preparations, so the public security in Chahar Province can be said to be worry-free. As for the Jin-Sui generals, they all have a common hatred for the Japanese aggression. Here are the talks of Fu Zuo Yi and Liu Yi Fei as follows to show a glimpse.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuo Yi Said</h3>
<p>In summary, after the Japanese army seized the three northeastern provinces, they are now invading Jehol and coveting North China. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? All our national generals should lead their troops to the front line and fight the Japanese bandits. The Jin-Sui generals have prepared everything and will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves.</p>
<h3>Liu Yi Fei Said</h3>
<p>In summary, since I resigned from the position of Chairman and military positions in Chahar Province, I have been living in the old capital for half a year. Recently, I felt that the national crisis was becoming more and more urgent. With the fall of Chengde, North China is in great danger. Therefore, since I was ordered to organize the Vanguard Army Headquarters, I have taken money from my private pockets, raised 100,000 yuan, and summoned the troops and commanded the volunteer army in the western border of Jehol, determined to counterattack in order to recover Chengde as soon as possible. I was born in the military and only know how to serve the country, not for my family or personal interests. This time to the front, if I do not recover Chengde and the lost territory, I will never return to see my countrymen. (March 9th)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Martyrdom of Ma Xianzhang of the Jilin Self-Defense Army</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese for Years, Greatly Boosted Morale</p>
<p>Traitorous Schemes Lead to Tragic Murder</p>
<p>When the Japanese bandits invaded and occupied the three provinces, outstanding people in the country were moved by righteousness and pity and swore to resist the humiliation, to win glory for the country. In the three northeastern provinces, besides General Ma Zhanshan and Li Du, there was also Ma Xianzhang. Mr. Ma, with a regiment of people, fought for years, and his morale was boosted day by day, and his strength increased to six brigades. Under his repeated attacks, the recovery of the mountains and rivers will be possible one day. But unfortunately, he was tragically murdered by the wolves. Now the bandits are invading Jehol. I don't know what Mr. Ma would think if he knew.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Mr. Ma</h3>
<p>Ma Xianzhang, styled Ze Zhou, was a native of Chaoyang, Jehol, 50 years old. He was still strong, righteous and generous. After graduating from the Northeast Qingwu Hall, his knowledge was more outstanding. When Li Du was guarding Yilan, Ma once served as his deputy chief of staff, suppressing bandits and reorganizing the army. His advice was outstanding, so the Songhua River Basin was praised, and Li relied on him more and more. During the Pan-Liao Incident, Li Du led the army to denounce the rebellion, revealing the banner of the Jilin Self-Defense Army. At that time, Mr. Ma was holding the regiment, and after receiving the order, he took the lead, so he was able to quickly conquer Harbin and other important places. Mr. Ma, with the remaining power of victory, his morale was even stronger, and Li Yi Jia expanded it into a brigade in order to launch a major offensive. He met the army on the left road, and the commander Zhang Zhi Bang was defeated and went to Peiping. The army lacked command and discipline was disrupted. At this time, the survival of the entire army of the Self-Defense Army was at stake. Mr. Ma, at this time of chaos and no master, took on the difficult task, and with one call, all the soldiers were brave. He was more united, and the generals trusted him. In June of the 21st year, he took over the post of commander of the left wing of the Jilin Self-Defense Army. The headquarters was still located at the Dongtie Xiachangzi Station.</p>
<h3>A Magnificent Record of Battle</h3>
<p>When Mr. Ma was the regiment commander attacking Harbin, he led less than a thousand people, and drove away the Japanese army and the puppet country with more than five thousand people. In just half a day, the Qing Bai national flag that the Harbin people longed for was flying all over the city. Order was restored, and the enemy was pursued in the city. He originally hoped to directly attack Changchun in one fell swoop. It was expected that the newly surrendered regiment commander Song betrayed the army, and the whole army was at a loss. Mr. Ma desperately led his troops to fight against the attack of the rebellious soldiers. On a pile of soil, pointing left and right, several of his followers fell to the ground, but Mr. Ma did not care. When he saw the enemy approaching, it was too late to avoid him. A car came, and the car was already full. The driver, Wang, rushed to help him get into the car. Ma Junqu stood beside the car and opened it very quickly. It took a long time to reach the rear and returned to Yilan. He was ordered to Dongtie to respond to the battle of the Japanese army in Tielinghe. The battle was extremely fierce. The artillery fire was overwhelming. The enemy had airplanes, heavy artillery, field artillery, mountain artillery, and light machine guns. The more they attacked, the more intense the artillery fire became in order to achieve the purpose of covering up. It is not necessary to say how dense the light machine guns fired. Our army, in addition to several mountain guns, fired a few times to boost the morale of the army, only held six or seventy percent of the new chain rifles to fight back. In the end, with the spirit of swearing to die, they were not defeated. The enemy knew that the morale was strong. For several months, Ma Jun could plan the battle situation calmly. The defense work could be used permanently. Although it was not possible to attack, the territory of the eight counties of China could still be preserved. At that time, Ding Chao was stationed in Baoqing County and Li Du was stationed in Lishuzhen, resting their horses a little. Ma Jun's defense was heavy, and he was alert at night, especially concerned about the pain of the people. Therefore, each brigade under his command did not dare to disturb the people. The anti-Japanese officers and soldiers were very poor, but the Self-Defense Army was named as such, and it should be like this. Among them, Liu Wankui, who came from a bandit, relapsed and hated Ma Jun's strict military discipline, so he intended to murder him.</p>
<h3>Details of the Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Liu Wankui, styled Zhen Bang, nicknamed Liu Kuailei, was from Ningan. He came from a bandit who robbed and raped, all over the county. The local people suffered from his ferocity and it was difficult to suppress him. They had no choice but to find a way to recruit him and make him the captain of the Ningan Security Team, and later promoted him to the captain of the General Team. As the Dong Province Incident gradually invaded Ningan, Liu felt that his job was unstable, so he rebelled and left his troops, and eventually had nowhere to go. He joined Ma Jun Jun Bian Brigade, and was filled with the leader. After a few months, he privately recruited bandits and called himself the brigade commander. Liu Ziyelang was self-arrogant. Because the Self-Defense Army was disciplined, he could not make money in comparison. He felt disappointed that his desires were difficult to fill. Therefore, he asked his adoptive father Sun Yat-tang to persuade him to surrender to the Japanese army. Sun Yat-tang was a giant merchant in Ningan. He had a fire mill in the street (ie, a flour company). He was known as Sun Xiaobian. He was alert and eloquent. As soon as the Japanese army arrived in Ningan, Sun married his beloved daughter Jiang to a Japanese Major General. After the event was completed, he was trusted by the Japanese Major General. He said that Liu Wankui was his adopted son and wanted to surrender to the Japanese army. Please allow him to be accepted. The Japanese Major General agreed, so Liu led the army and entrusted himself to the enemy. After a long time, the enemy knew that Liu was a greedy person who would do anything for profit. I don't know what strategy to teach him, but Liu even sang the return of justice to Dongtie Muling Station. The generals wanted to kill him, but because they were not ordered, they did not do it. Please ask Ma Jun, Ma Jun waited for Liu Hou to mistakenly believe that he was thinking about returning to righteousness. He was deceived by Liu's self-proclaimed fraudulent surrender, and Liu arrived at Lishuzhen to collect taxes and detain goods. There was no end to all kinds of illegal things. He heard from Hei Jun that he wanted to go to Zhen to take over. The chief of staff and the chiefs of each department strongly prevented him from going. They all agreed that representatives should be sent. Because Liu was unpredictable, he was afraid of accidents. Ma did not listen to the funeral. The next morning (December 2) he went to Lishuzhen. As soon as Ma Jun arrived in the town, the long-distance telephone was cut off and the train was stopped. A few days later, it was heard that Ma Jun's body was found. He was strangled to death with a rope. After a long time, he woke up and used a pistol to shoot one bullet at the head and chest. When the bad news came, the officers and soldiers of the headquarters screamed and cried, and the soldiers of each battalion rioted. The situation that cried and scolded Liu Kuailei was unclear. At night, they applied ointment to the cart and Ma, claiming to avenge the commander-in-chief. Fortunately, the officials in charge of each brigade told them that the overall situation was important. The feud should be avenged, but we must wait for the opportunity. After a storm, they saw a little rest. Commander-in-chief Li Du also heard the news, cried loudly, his spirit seemed crazy, vomited several mouthfuls of blood, stomped his feet and sighed, and then encouraged each other to try harder and maintain calmness. Liu Wankui, since he murdered Ma Jun, because the matter belonged to rebellion, he was afraid of being besieged and went to Bamiantong to watch the situation. The enemy had already detected this matter (it is said that Liu Kuailei sent someone to send a letter to his Dongyang sister-in-law, and the messenger was awarded 500 yuan). Ma Jun, who was both intelligent and brave, has passed away. The Japanese are even more unscrupulous. On January 1 this year, the Self-Defense Army gradually became unable to support itself. Commander-in-chief Li Du led his troops to retreat to Mishan. According to Ma Jun's miscalculation, he encountered the disaster because he treated Liu too well, hoping that he would return to the right track and fight against Japan together, otherwise how could he dare to go? This is also because he trusted people too deeply, and after the fact, he speculated that Liu Kuailei's collection of taxes and detention of merchants in Lishuzhen was a two-pronged approach (1) It can motivate Ma to go to Lishuzhen (2) It can solidify the evil. The reason why Liu forgot his righteousness and disregarded everything was that someone said that the puppet country, according to the Japanese plan, ordered Liu to kill Li Du Ma Xianzhang at the same time and seal Liu as Jihui Hou. It is said that it is a rumor, but Liu Kuailei and Ma did have feelings, but there was no gap. It is known to all the people of the Self-Defense Army, and there is no other purpose. What can be done for this. Ma Jun has always taken seeking truth from facts as his slogan. He can lead an army of six brigades, but he has never sent special personnel to contact the domestic patriotic groups, and he does not know how to promote the work to the people of the country. His life is not important whether he promotes it or not. His death is that his patriotic enthusiasm and magnificent record are as rotten as grass and trees, which is regrettable. I will briefly describe his outline to highlight his achievements.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Ordered to Solicit Donations to Purchase Aircraft</p>
<p>With the loss of Jehol, the public believes that it will be difficult to recover the lost territory if aircraft are not used in the war. The county party headquarters has organized a committee to raise funds to purchase aircraft to save the country and is actively carrying out its work. It has recently learned that the county government has also been ordered, roughly stating that Central Executive Committee member Wang Qi had proposed to the meeting a proposal to raise funds in various provinces, cities, and counties to purchase aircraft. The Standing Committee decided to issue an order to the counties. According to the ranking, this county should raise 15,000 yuan. The county government will convene people from all walks of life to discuss ways to solicit donations so that they can be reported and resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Exempt Late Fees for Added Grain Transport Taxes</h3>
<p>This county previously received a provincial order for the second phase of land price tax. Every stone was added to the grain transport tax by one yuan and it was still collected. After the false production, it was requested that the ministry and province be exempted from the levy, but it was not approved. As the limit for the collection of the second phase of the land price tax expired, those who paid beyond the limit in accordance with the regulations must be fined one-tenth of a cent for late payment, and the added grain transport tax of one yuan would also be collected together with the late payment fine. The director of the Production Department and Li Zuli of Qingpu and Songjiang counties have repeatedly sent telegrams to the provincial government, stating that after the disaster, the cheap food injured the farmers, and the economy was exhausted. At the time of exempting the late payment fine from the added grain transport tax item to relieve the people's difficulties, the county government has now received instructions from the provincial government, approving the exemption of the late payment fine for the added grain transport tax.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Hall Order to Rush to Build the Sujia Road</p>
<p>Since the construction of the Sujia Highway by the Su Construction Hall began, a year has passed. The bridges and roads from Suzhou to Wujiang have been completed. The roads from Wujiang to Pingwang have been filled by the people. The road surface is being paved. However, there are still four very large bridges that have not been started. The road surface from Pingwang to Jiaxing is also being paved. It will take at least four or five months for the entire project to be completed. Wu, the section chief of the Su Construction Hall, took a horse-drawn carriage to Suzhou the other day to inspect the project along the road to Wujiang. After returning to the hall, he ordered the Sujia Road Engineering Office to rush to construct in order to open to traffic as soon as possible. As for the opening of long-distance buses, merchants from all over the country hope to run them, and construction agencies from all over the country hope to run them. Director Dong of the Construction Hall is still planning in detail whether to run them or run them.</p>
<h3>Zhang Taiyan Comes to Suzhou to Lecture</h3>
<p>The master of Chinese studies, Mr. Zhang Taiyan, came to Suzhou this time to lecture. He was invited by Tang Weizhi of Wuxi to lecture in Wuxi for two days. He has already come to Suzhou and will continue to lecture in the library for two days from 4:00 p.m. on the sixteenth, and then he will return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Qian Dajun Comes to Suzhou to Sweep Graves</h3>
<p>Qian Dajun, the commander of the Wuhan Fortress, came to Suzhou the other day and went directly to his private residence. Few people outside knew about it. It is said that Qian came to worship his ancestral tomb and will leave Suzhou for Hankou in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Self-Refining Kerosene Implements Taxation</p>
<p>Last year, the local salara oil factories rose in great numbers, and the kerosene they refined competed to sell in the market, which greatly affected the kerosene of the United Kingdom and the United States in China. However, the foreign merchants had to pay national taxes when they imported salara oil through customs, while the Chinese merchants sold the kerosene refined from salara oil everywhere without paying taxes. They believed that the Chinese and foreign merchants were treated unfairly, so they immediately tried to resist the penalty and reduced the amount of salara oil shipped to China. The Chinese government was affected by this. In order to seek to supplement the meter, Shu Shifu, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, decided to collect a tax of one dime for every large ocean. After it was submitted to the provincial government, Hua passed it, and appointed Yan Naicheng as the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Self-Refining Oil Tax Bureau. The bureau was located in Wuxi, and collection offices were established in the four counties of Suchengwu to implement taxation. Director Ding had come to Xixi from the province the other day and surveyed the houses of the former Entertainment Industry Association in Changkangli outside Guangfu Gate as the bureau site. He officially worked from yesterday (the sixteenth) and will implement the opening collection in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Two Bandits Sentenced to Death by Shooting</h3>
<p>Weng Zhendong, a villager in Xuedian Township, the 12th district of the county, was kidnapped by six bandits, including Huang Baojin and Chen Zengshi, in the autumn of last year, and a large sum of money was extorted. Afterwards, Zhu Meiji, the security chief of the 8th district, arrested the bandits Huang and Chen and presented them to the county government. They were interrogated and detained. Recently, Magistrate Chen presented the two bandits Huang and Chen, who had committed more serious crimes, to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday (the sixteenth) at 11:00 a.m., police were sent to escort them to the South School Ground for execution by shooting. The remaining four accomplices were transferred to the county court for trial.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Town Cheng Section Road Construction Meeting</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 15th, Magistrate Si of Wuyi convened a meeting to discuss the requisitioning of labor and road construction for the Wujin section of the Zhen Cheng Trunk Road. The meeting resolved that: (1) the district chiefs of each district would be the general section chiefs, and the deputy heads of each township would be the deputy section chiefs, to be appointed separately by the county government; (2) the roster of requisitioned laborers should be compiled by the section chiefs by the 20th of this month and submitted to the district for reporting and verification; (3) obstacles within the route should be removed within a specified period; otherwise, those responsible would be investigated; (4) the groundbreaking ceremony for the section from Xinmen to Longhu Pond was set for 9:00 AM on the 22nd, to be held at Longhu Pond; the groundbreaking ceremony for the section from Benniu to Menghe was set for 12:00 PM on the 24th, to be held at Sixia; (5) for the section from Longhu Pond to Shiqiao, which is about twenty li long and mostly elevated, the county government should request an appropriate increase in labor and water fees.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Repairing the Official Dikes along the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangxian, Chairman of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission of the Ministry of Transportation, believing that the Yangtze River is prone to flooding with the arrival of spring, stated that all official dikes on both banks should be given special attention for protection if they have already been repaired, and those not yet completed must be finished as soon as possible. In addition, all branch dikes should be ordered by the local authorities, with the gentry and merchants in each area responsible for their speedy repair. At the same time, villagers should be strictly prohibited from digging up soil near the dikes to prevent risks and facilitate reinforcement. He specifically telegraphed the provincial government to instruct this county's government to comply. It is now known that after receiving the order, Magistrate Ma has instructed the Public Security Bureau and district offices to quickly investigate and determine if there are any uncompleted sections of the official dikes along both banks of the Yangtze River within their jurisdictions, and to immediately convene local people to repair them as soon as possible, and to prohibit villagers from digging up soil near the river dikes at any time to avoid danger.</p>

<p>Major Fire by the Stinky River</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 13th) at around 6:00 PM, a fire broke out at the home of a resident surnamed Yang near the Stinky River outside the North Gate of this city, due to carelessness with fire. The fire quickly raged out of control. Although water dragons from various towns arrived to fight the fire, the wind was too strong, making it difficult to extinguish. The fire spread to the neighboring home of a resident surnamed Zhang. It took four hours to extinguish the fire. The houses and all belongings of both the Yang and Zhang families were completely destroyed, with losses estimated at over four thousand yuan. When the fire broke out, an elderly woman surnamed Lin, who lived next door, was burned severely while helping the Yang family move items. Her life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Precious Pearl Stolen from Zhenwu Temple</h3>
<p>The precious pearl on the main hall of Zhenwu Temple outside the North Gate of this city is as big as a basketball, and its color changes every hour. This morning (the 14th), a person speaking with a southern accent, dressed in luxurious clothing, came to the temple. He immediately took out a foreign dollar and asked the temple keeper to buy incense and candles for him. By the time the keeper returned to the temple, the person had disappeared without a trace. It was then discovered that the precious pearl on the main hall was missing. It is known that it was stolen. The abbot of the temple immediately notified the town authorities to pursue the thief.</p>

<p>Recruiting Soldier Accidentally Wounds Pedestrian with Gun</p>
<p>The former Jiaxing-administered privately-run anti-smuggling team heard that some smuggled salt was leaking out and dispatched several soldiers to block the way at Liuli Kan. Among them, a soldier named A Jin neglected his duty and secretly went to a nearby civilian's house to eavesdrop. He also played with the box-type pistol he was carrying, which was frightening. Unexpectedly, there was a bullet in the chamber, which suddenly fired. It hit a Zhang family woman who was walking on the road. She collapsed on the spot, covered in blood. Her husband, hearing the news, rushed over and sent the injured woman to the South Gate Hospital. According to the doctor, the bullet had entered the bone and could not be treated, so she was transferred to Jiaxing Hospital for treatment. A Jin, who caused the accident, has already fled far away.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Expected to Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Cabinet Ministers to Come to Shanghai to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Dockworkers Issue Declaration Urging Wang to Resume Post</p>
<p>Premier Wang Jingwei and his wife are returning from Europe aboard the French postal ship "Aramis," which has already passed Hong Kong and is heading to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at the port at around 2:00 PM this afternoon. Ministers of the Executive Yuan and various departments will all go to the dock to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Arriving This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The French postal ship "Aramis" carrying Wang Jingwei is expected to enter the Wusong Estuary at 12:30 PM this afternoon and dock at the China Merchants Bureau's central pier on East Broadway Road at around 3:00 PM. However, it is possible that Wang will not disembark from that pier.</p>
<p>It was faintly heard yesterday that the Jianghai Customs authorities had dispatched the "Jinghui" launch. When the postal ship arrives at the port, it will carry Acting Premier Song Ziwen and several others from the Jianghai Customs pier to the ship to welcome Wang Jingwei, or they may accompany Wang Jingwei and his wife on the small launch back to the Jianghai Customs pier to disembark.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Committee</h3>
<p>All ministers of the Executive Yuan have decided to go to the dock to welcome Wang Jingwei back, in order to urge him to quickly go to Nanjing and resume his post. Currently, among those affiliated with the Executive Yuan, except for Minister of Military Affairs and Chairman of the Pingfen Committee He Yingqin, who is in charge of military affairs in the north and cannot come to Shanghai, and Acting Premier Song Ziwen, Secretary-General Chu Minyi, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, and Secretary-General of the Central Political Council Tang Youren, who have already arrived in Shanghai one after another, the remaining ministers and committee chairmen, as well as the secretary-general of the Central Standing Committee, will also arrive in Shanghai on the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight train at around 8:00 AM this morning, preparing to go to the dock to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Workers' Declaration</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all dockworkers in Shanghai issued a declaration urging Wang Jingwei to return to Nanjing to take charge, in order to welcome his return to China, saying: "Dear compatriots, we should still remember the horrors and cruel actions of Japanese imperialism during the 'September 18th Incident' in the Northeast and the 'January 28th Incident' in Shanghai. During that precarious period, Mr. Wang Jingwei, with his courageous spirit and great personality, took on the difficult task without avoiding danger. Shanghai's escape from falling into the hands of the Japanese invaders was due to the desperate resistance of the 19th Route Army, but wasn't Mr. Wang's strong advocacy a driving force behind that courage? When Mr. Wang went abroad for medical treatment, we immediately felt that the country had lost a part of its strength. Although Mr. Wang was fighting for the country abroad during this national crisis, our central organization could not be fully sound. When Mr. Wang fell ill, the country also fell ill with him. Now, the military flag of the Japanese imperialists has been planted beyond the various passes of our Great Wall. The survival of the Chinese nation has reached a critical moment. In fact, it is already intolerable and unbearable. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang is bearing full responsibility for the military affairs in North China, and he is going north despite his illness. The battle reports of recent days are not as precarious as before, and the prospects are gradually becoming optimistic. However, the great task of saving the country cannot be borne by a few people alone. We must unite the strength of the masses to deal with the coming invasion, and consolidating the rear is an even more important plan. Therefore, with a heart full of enthusiasm, we have sincere expectations for Mr. Wang. We are laborers with short clothes and bare feet, and we don't understand etiquette very well. We only know how to resist those who exploit us and support those who help us. We want to make our country achieve equal status in the international community, and we also want to improve the lives of domestic laborers. Mr. Wang is certainly one of the people we admire who is willing to do his best in these two aspects. In the past year, the status of our hundreds of thousands of dockworkers has increased, and of course we cannot but thank Mr. Wang. At this critical moment, Mr. Wang resolutely returns to the country. The happiness he will bring to us... Compatriots, we should unite and support Mr. Wang and immediately return to Nanjing to take charge for the sake of the Party and the country, for the sake of the people. If Mr. Wang does not disappoint our sincerity and carries out his usual advocacy, then the future of the Party and the country will be fortunate, and the Chinese nation will be fortunate."</p>
<h3>Two Groups of Rescue Teams and慰劳Representatives Set Off Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Yan Fuqing Northeast Association, recognizing the intensity of the war in North China and the need for rescue work, resolved at a general meeting to send Dr. Yan Fuqing to lead a rescue team of thirty people, carrying cash of five thousand yuan and various medicines, to the front lines via the express train at 9:25 yesterday morning. They were tasked with rescuing wounded anti-Japanese soldiers and sending telegrams to Generals Sun Dianying and Song Zheyuan. The telegrams are listed below: (1) To the Northern Ping Military Council, addressed to Commander-in-Chief Sun Dianying: "Since the fall of Chengde, the enemy's forces have become even more fierce. Your Excellency has fought bitterly with your isolated army, ultimately protecting western Rehe. All of our nation is filled with admiration. We hope that you will continue to resist tyranny and work to restore the country. The Northeast Association respectfully bows, Han." (2) To the Northern Ping Military Council, addressed to Commander-in-Chief Song Zheyuan: "The fall of Chengde has caused grief and indignation throughout the country. Fortunately, Your Excellency is loyal and courageous, and your soldiers are dedicated. If you continue to move forward, it will not be difficult to recover the lost territories. We, the people in the rear, should mobilize and provide a unified backing. The Northeast Association respectfully bows, Han." Feng Shaoshan, the representative of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, went north on the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train yesterday at 11:00 PM to慰劳various anti-Japanese generals. In addition to having the议会prepare letters to He Yingqin, Song Mingxuan (Zheyuan), and Sun Dianying (Kuiyuan), he also telegraphed Song yesterday, saying: "Admiration for Army Commander Song Zheyuan's brave deeds at Xifengkou, and to all the soldiers of the army: The violent Japanese barbarians have no moral limits. After occupying the three provinces, they invaded Rehe. Although our government has the determination to resist, it has no preparations for war. Tang's昏唐 retreated without a fight, and the barriers were completely lost. The enemy reached the Great Wall. Your Association was ordered to station at the key point of Xifengkou. You fought bravely in hand-to-hand combat, killing enemy generals and seizing flags, and annihilating the enemy. News of your victory has spread frequently, and the whole country is rejoicing. We still hope that you will continue to work hard, advance straight ahead, join forces at Chengde, and drink to the health of victory. Our Association, in addition to coordinating with the Northeast Refugee Relief Association and collecting funds to be remitted, and sending Mr. Feng Shaoshan to the front to offer慰劳, hereby sends this message first, and looks forward to more news of your victory soon. Sincerely, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang, Du Chongyuan, and Chen Ya-fu, permanent directors of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, respectfully bow, Shan."</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Sends Representative to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Li Haiqing's Troops Telegraph for Relief</p>
<p>Sun Dianying, commander of the 41st Army, sent Zhang Youqun, director of the political department, to Shanghai yesterday with a letter requesting aid because the army lacked supplies. The 8th Army Corps under Li Haiqing also telegraphed for aid. The Tianjin Local Association telegraphed requesting assistance for Song's troops. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sun's Army Seeks Aid: Sun Dianying sent Zhang Youqun to Shanghai with a letter to seek help from the Support Association. The original letter said, "Since the fall of Chengde, the retreat of our troops has been cut off. The isolated army is deep in the enemy territory. Ammunition is running low, and supplies are running out. At minus forty degrees, they fought bloody battles for ten days and nights. Soldiers are wearing single layers of clothing and suffering from hunger. Dozens of people are dying every day from frostbite, starvation, injuries, and lack of medicine. The situation is extremely miserable and indescribable. Although the situation is difficult, the morale is high. They are fighting bravely, vowing to drive out the invaders. The entire army is still in the area of Dazhuizi Mountain, Sandaoyingzi, and Fengning, fighting fiercely with the enemy. I have specially sent my brother Youqun to Shanghai to present the situation in person and ask Mr. [omitted] to guide us with sincerity. I pray that you will listen to my words, etc." It is heard that the Support Association has already purchased all available funds to provide assistance. It is hoped that all sectors will do their best to donate.</p>
<p>Li's Troops Telegraph: (Titles omitted) "I have just received a telegram from General Commander Li of our army, stating that the loss of Kailu is heartbreaking. Our department defended the rear and fought hard for ten days. Ultimately, due to a lack of weapons and ammunition and no military aid, they had to concentrate in western Rehe. In this battle, our army suffered heavy losses due to brave resistance and requires weapons and ammunition to be replenished. We hope that you will quickly appeal to all parties for full assistance to facilitate military operations," said Li Zhongyi and Zhen, etc. "Since the fall of the Northeast, Commander Li has been committed to resisting Japan and saving the country, gathering heroes from northern Hebei and vowing to defend the territory. For a year, he has fought in Jilin and Heilongjiang, repeatedly defeating the enemy, making it impossible for all their political work to be carried out. It is hoped that the people of the country have witnessed these events. Last winter, in coordination with the Soviet army, they attacked Jiangyuan. Later, due to the defeat in northern Manchuria, they ran out of ammunition and aid. They led the remaining ten thousand troops to Rehe to replenish their supplies in order to fight again. The Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association provided more than 40,000 yuan in national currency, 7,000 sets of military uniforms, 6,000 hand grenades, 200,000 bullets, 500 shells, and 2 machine guns, which slightly replenished the supplies. Then, they repeatedly fought against the Japanese and puppet armies in the Kailu area and were once again exhausted. After this, how can we fully assist them? Even if the soldiers are committed, how can they fight without military strength? At this time, when the enemy's flames are blazing and the country is in danger, we can only hope that all parties will quickly provide assistance, so that military preparations can be fully strengthened and they can jointly resist the enemy. We are filled with anticipation. Respectfully, the Northeast Volunteer Army 8th Army Corps in Ping."</p>
<p>Seeking Aid for Song and Sun: The Tianjin Local Association, believing that Song's troops were bravely fighting the enemy, telegraphed the Shanghai Support Association yesterday to be forwarded to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Local Association, and various charitable organizations: (Titles omitted) "Army Commander Song Mingxuan of Xifengkou is bravely fighting the enemy and has achieved great victories. Commander-in-Chief Sun Dianying is fighting alone in the Yuan territory and is in distress in Rehe. They are both extraordinary heroes and good generals of the country. Our people should be their support. We hope that you will quickly provide assistance and慰劳them to boost their morale." Respectfully, the Tianjin Local Association.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Telegraph慰劳Song, Guan, and Sun</h3>
<p>The Seamen's Party Branch Telegraphs: The Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch, because Song Zheyuan and others have repeatedly defeated the enemy, and Division Commander Guan Linzheng was wounded while resisting the enemy, sent telegrams to express congratulations and慰劳. The original telegrams are as follows: Telegram to Song Zheyuan, etc.: (Omitted) "Committee Member He of the Northern Ping Military Council to Chairman Song and all the soldiers at the front: Japan has invaded Rehe recklessly, like a wild boar and a long snake, its momentum is unstoppable. Gentlemen, you have fought bravely and repeatedly defeated the enemy. The success of the recovery can be expected in the near future.

We pray that you will take care of yourself for the sake of the country. Respectfully, the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Branch of the Kuomintang."</p>
<p>The National Products Factory Association Telegraphs: The National Products Factory Association telegraphed Generals Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>"Since hearing of the fall of Chengde, everyone has hated Tang's incompetence. Recently, we received battle reports that your department has been fighting bloody battles, disregarding your own lives. The enemy has suffered great damage, and countless military supplies have been captured, which has brought glory to the nation. We are overjoyed. We still pray that you will lead the brave soldiers to continue to work hard and recover Rehe to protect the northern gateway. In addition to sending letters to various factories to request捐助supplies to express慰劳, we send this telegram to you and wish you success."</p>
<p>The Telegraph Workers' National Salvation Association sends telegrams to Army Commander Song and all anti-Japanese soldiers: "During this time when the violent Japanese have coveted Rehe, our troops defending the territory have retreated without fighting. In a matter of days, they lost thousands of miles of territory, causing friendly countries to laugh and endangering the entire country. After hearing the news, the comrades have nothing but hatred and tears. Now, fortunately, you have率师advanced and bravely killed the enemy, bringing glory to the nation and avenging the country. The victory at Xifengkou, where thousands of enemies were killed, has been reported, and we are deeply impressed. We still pray that you will hold on to the spirit of never giving up and continue to fight hard. The telegraph workers of the whole country vow to be your backing. We respectfully send this telegram of慰劳and look forward to news of your victory. Respectfully, the Telegraph Workers' National Salvation Association."</p>
<h3>He Sui Describes the Loss of Rehe</h3>
<p>Explains the Reasons</p>
<p>Does Not Hide Failure</p>
<p>Various public organizations received a telegram from He Sui in Peiping, which reads, "According to the telegram from He, a special commissioner of the Jilin-Heilongjiang Rescue Association in Rehe, that on the first day of this month when he arrived at Baishou, seventy miles from Lingyuan, the fighting began. That area was defended by the 130th Division of Yu Zhaolin. On the first day and night, the enemy broke through the center of the defense line with several armored vehicles because the line had not been excavated. The division immediately retreated from Ji Baishou. The organs in Lingyuan and the division headquarters also retreated to Pingquan at the same time. On the morning of the second day, the enemy's armored vehicles drove straight into Lingyuan. The division commander, not receiving the news until the enemy entered Lingyuan, detoured and also retreated to Pingquan. Enemy aircraft came to scout the baggage train on the Lingping Avenue twenty miles away and fired shells front and back. At four o'clock in the afternoon, enemy aircraft came again and strafed with machine guns. At Sanjiazi, ninety miles from Lingyuan, a portion of the 685th Regiment and artillery were stationed. When the enemy invaded Lingyuan, they left the area and retreated along the way. The disorderly situation and the bombing by enemy aircraft were all experienced firsthand. When they arrived at Sanjiazi, they saw that the defending troops there not only did not shelter or protect the retreating troops, but also fled at the first sign of trouble. The order of their retreat was that cavalry and infantry went first, with baggage and heavy equipment left behind. They even feared that the troops in front would be slow and frequently fired their guns to urge them to continue. The fleeing soldiers discarded baggage and heavy equipment on the road and seized vehicles to ride on. The artillery also unloaded the horses and rode away, leaving shells scattered all over the ground, all to the benefit of the enemy. The 130th Division had no wounded soldiers on the front line. The 129th Division fled at the first sign of trouble, and all the deaths and injuries were caused by trampling and shooting each other while fleeing. At noon at 8:00, the enemy's armored vehicles chased past Sanjiazi. Pingquan was abandoned at that time. Wan Fulin arrived in Lingyuan on the afternoon of the first day, rested briefly, and then returned to Pingquan. On the afternoon of the second day, after hearing that Lingyuan had fallen, he retreated to Kuanchengzi. On the fourth day, he retreated into Xifengkou, thirty miles to Zhuanghe Bridge, and now is收容the remnants under Wan's command. Very few of the 130th Division were able to reach the收容point. On the third day, there was heavy snow, and enemy aircraft did not come to scout. The 129th Division was able to retreat leisurely and was attacked by enemy aircraft and armored vehicles near Kuanchengzi on the fourth day. The loss was about two-thirds. On the fourth day, the enemy had advanced to Dajikou. Wan Fulin and his troops had no ability or determination to resist. If the 29th Army is not immediately transferred to advance on the defense line of Xifengkou, then the loss of the city is a matter of days. He,奉 General Zhu Ziqiao's order, went to the front line to inspect, and entered Xifengkou via Pingquan Kuanchengzi, and returned to Peiping on the ninth day. What the newspapers have reported above is all untrue. I am afraid that people will be deceived, which will mislead the national defense. I am in danger, and I dare not remain silent. I submit this report,查Rehe, since the September 18th Incident, has caused the義勇the army and the troops in northern Hebei not to be able to cross the Rehe border by one step due to Zhang and Tang's discord. The Support Association, considering the area to be an important area for resisting Japan, after several months of疏通, Zhang and Tang finally cooperated. The Northeast義the army, since the end of autumn of last year, being without clothes or food, had no choice but to gather at the Rehe border. There were tens of thousands of people before and after, and the members were complex and opinions were divided. The Central Peiping Military Branch did not want to directly command, so the Support Association reluctantly fulfilled its duty as a commoner and entrusted Sui and others to temporarily handle it. Yuguan was双起 and Rehe was in greater danger. Initially, the enemy attacked our transportation routes, using the Siping-Taonan, Datong-Beining, and Southern Manchurian routes. The警備areas of the義the army in the Rehe area, from Kailu, Suidong, Fuxin, to Lingnan, formed a parallel line from north to south. Most of the義the army belonged to the cavalry. If they could advance several tens of miles, they would cut off the enemy's transportation everywhere. In the event of a failure, they could also retreat westward, without hindering the防the work of the赤峰, Lingyuan, and Lingnan national armies'阵地Moreover, most of the puppet army also had secret contacts with the義the army. Once they advanced, they could应be应. In January of this year, the puppet army sent a committee to Rehe to discuss certain important tasks to be completed before the end of January with Zhu Gong and Sui et al. Their representatives also went to the central government to present the plan. Since January, Japanese aircraft have been continuously bombing in Kailu, 洼, etc. On the day the incident was reported, the Japanese and puppet joint troops advanced towards Kailu. At this time, Zhang Xueliang advocated military unity and收the義the army under his jurisdiction. The Support Association immediately handed it over. Zhang repeatedly reconsidered and reorganized, and the matter remained undecided for a long time, while the enemy was approaching every moment. At this time, the Support Association had no right to interfere, and Pingfen did not accept it, so the義the army in Rehe had no contact or system, and was out of ammunition and food, and there was no door to呼吁. The Support Association either代requested餉shell, or代requested a speed表. Zhang置Zhen,指挥指挥, Zhang ignored it. Kailu 1 corner, since January 删 date, every day suffered猛攻bombing, support to敬 day, a total of 40 days. Zhang's procrastination and贻误 led to the义军 being unable to retreat. Suidong Fuxin, and Hua's, were also affected and caused a full-line牵动 Now, according to the former telegram, the national army began to发生battles at Ye Baishou on March 1. Zhang's本部main military, with its division of troops, was broken through by several combat vehicles,争 and the enemy swept away. From the night of March 1st, until March 4th, they had not been able to collect the车辆, and弹械remained遗 scattered throughout the district. T湯玉麟 abandoned承德尚on the night of March 2nd. Zhang's Xueliang本部main force had溃scattered, not because of the loss of Chengde. It can be imagined. Such an僨事誠is a singular disgrace unprecedented since ancient times. In terms of reasons,高 killing指挥官 is only arrogant威 , but without能力. In the lower one, we can act on behalf of the private and restrain others. The people are resentful. For 군비, they arbitrary侵饱 them.

<h3>Chen Gongbo's Talk</h3>
<p>Possible Changes to the Sino-German Steel Plant Contract</p>
<p>Direct Negotiation Claims are Just Speculation</p>
<p>It is reported by the National News Agency that Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industries, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday to attend the Jiang-Zhe Fisheries Improvement Association and to meet Wang Jingwei. Yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock, reporters met with Chen at the He residence on Route Lafayette and inquired about the various situations in the central government. The conversation went as follows: Regarding the Sino-German Steel Plant, Chen said that he intended to publish an article on the Sino-German joint steel plant contract within a few days. Because the affairs involved are complex, a detailed discussion at this time would not be possible. However, the general situation can be roughly discussed. The Sino-German Steel Plant contract was originally scheduled to be signed on December 1st of last year, but that date has passed. Currently, a draft agreement has been signed. The reason for the delay in the original contract is not due to a single issue, such as the reorganization of the Leijia Gou coal mine. First, 100,000 yuan needs to be raised to build five platforms and open a self-flowing well. Not only does the administrative iron smelting furnace need to be continuously reorganized, but also personnel must be sent to conduct measurements. Other small mines, such as the Gaokeng area near Pingxiang, Jiangxi, will also take four months to complete. For the sake of lasting benefits, the original contract has been delayed and not signed. Moreover, the previously proposed contract may have flaws based on the later situation. It is also possible that changes will be made at that time.</p>
<p>Regarding the Recent Situation of the Rehe War, Chen continued, "I am not clear about the details of the Rehe war. However, one thing I know is that our army at Xifengkou is indeed doing well, and the Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese and puppet forces are currently continuing to gather large numbers of reinforcements. They will definitely not mobilize troops from Korea. The reinforcements will be Japanese troops near the puppet state. The battle at Gubeikou is due to the many mountains outside the pass, or due to logistical and terrain reasons. Additional defenses have been built, but Nantianguan is indeed a key point in North China, and it is still being defended by our army."</p>
<p>Regarding the Trip North at the End of the Month, when asked about Chen's previous statement about going north, he replied, "I originally intended to go to Rehe, but due to the tense situation and the fall of Chengde, I am actually unwilling to go north. Furthermore, witnessing the loss of our territory, I have invisibly stopped. However, when the Ministry's affairs are slightly free, around the end of this month, I will still have to go. Because I still want to go and see the organization and industrial situation of the people in the area south of 　zhou and northeast of Tianjin."</p>
<p>Regarding Fisheries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, "The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Association is scheduled to meet tomorrow (today) afternoon at the Association's location. The previously determined plan is too large in scale, and due to economic relations, it is difficult to implement for the time being. Furthermore, according to the previous budget, if the plan is completed, it will require approximately 5 million yuan. Now that there are military affairs, it is even more difficult to raise funds. However, this matter can only be implemented gradually. Regarding the so-called gradual implementation, I have three points to tell you: (1) The most active reorganization at present is the ocean-going patrol ships. In the past, the expenses of the patrol ships were entirely collected by the patrol ships themselves. Now, they are all handled by the bureau (Management Bureau). If you want to generate profit, you must first eliminate malpractices. Therefore, the reorganization by the Ministry of Industries, if completed in the future, will reduce the suffering of fishermen, and it will also be very convenient in terms of command. In terms of expenses, each ship in the past was sufficient at 3,000 yuan per month. As for adding patrol ships, the spring fishing season has already arrived, and it is too late to build them. We can only wait until the end of this year and the beginning of next year to expand. (2) Small meteorological stations should be established in small ports along the coasts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Local meteorological conditions can be reported to various locations via radio. They can not only send but also receive. In addition, they should also strengthen contact with the Xujiahui Observatory in this city. In this way, Jiangsu and Zhejiang fishing boats can avoid unexpected encounters. (3) I plan to have some contact with the banking sector within the next few days to establish fishermen's lending institutions. Because fishermen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang generally feel economically difficult, they lack capital during the fishing season, and have no way to go out to fish. Occasionally, when borrowing from other places, the interest rates they pay are often above nine percent. In the future, after the lending institutions are established, my budget will only have a one-percent interest rate. This is also an urgent task to reduce the suffering of fishermen and revitalize the fishing industry. Fortunately, this matter is easy and can be launched with only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The above are all currently in active progress."</p>
<p>"We Must Recover Lost Territory. Regarding diplomacy, Minister Luo (Wengan) has already gone north. Various rumors are completely untrue. There are even claims that Luo's trip north is for direct negotiations. In fact, when Luo went north, did the Japanese side not say they would withdraw from the League of Nations? Therefore, Luo's trip north is precisely for this reason. In short, I believe and guarantee that the government will not take such a bad move. Everyone feels that it is difficult for the lost territory in the eastern provinces to return to its original owner, but I believe it can be recovered. However, how to recover it? I think military means are very difficult. It must be done through diplomatic means. What are the means? Even if I know, it is not convenient to say clearly. In short, I think that recovery within two or three months is impossible, but by the end of this year, there will definitely be a day to recover the lost territory."</p>
<p>"Wang Jingwei is Going to Beijing. Mr. Wang will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. He only sent a telegram from the road. After that, there was no communication. Because I am very busy with affairs, I must return to Beijing tomorrow night. And because of the meeting tomorrow afternoon, it is uncertain whether I will go to the ship to meet him and whether I can make it back to Beijing tomorrow night. What Mr. Wang will do after arriving in Shanghai, I will know after meeting him. As for the trip to Beijing, I guess it is possible." At this point, the conversation ended.</p>
<h3>Allocating Loan Funds for Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways suffered heavy losses from the January 28th Incident last year. Business was also greatly affected, resulting in the inability to repay the loans to the British and Chinese banks when they became due. Since Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu took office, they have recognized that although the economies of the two railways are extremely difficult, it is a matter of international debt credit and should be maintained. They have adhered to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways and have done their best to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Funds have been set aside from the daily business income specifically for repaying debts. Over the past few months, the results have been remarkable. A portion of the due loans for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been repaid. Several years ago, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway also borrowed from the British and Chinese Corporation to purchase vehicles, but no payments had ever been made. The first installment due will also be paid.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency in Nanjing, the Ministry of Railways will organize a Beijing-Shanghai Railway Debt Reorganization Committee. Mo Heng, the Chief of General Affairs of the Two Railways Administration, denied this statement yesterday. He said that there is no need to organize a debt reorganization committee for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at present. The total miscellaneous debts of the two railways currently amount to only more than 1.5 million yuan. More than 600,000 yuan have been repaid successively recently, leaving more than 800,000 yuan. If the situation is calm, it is expected that it can be completely repaid within six months. As for the loan from the British and Chinese Bank, there is still more than 14 million yuan. More than 300,000 yuan has been paid recently. The bureau plans to repay this loan after the miscellaneous debts have been cleared.</p>

<h3>German Consulate General Hoisted National Flag and Party Flag Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Acting German Consul General White Ren Des's Heroic Speech</p>
<p>Pledging Loyalty to the Motherland, Sharing Joys and Sorrows</p>
<p>Without Taking Risks, There Will Never Be Victory in Life</p>
<p>The German Consulate General in Shanghai on Huangpu Road, in accordance with the instructions of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hoisted the black, white, and red tricolor old national flag and the Nazi swastika flag yesterday afternoon, accompanied by solemn etiquette and a magnificent speech, evoking the martial spirit. Around noon that day, German expatriates and students from Wilhelm School flocked to the consulate general, filling the square. Representatives from the Italian Fascist Party also attended the grand ceremony. At 12 noon, twelve Brownshirts marched out of the consulate general in formation to the sound of military music and stood in front of the flagpole. Acting Consul General White Ren Des delivered a speech, explaining the important significance of this move. His words were extremely magnificent and deeply inspired the faint-hearted and deafened. He stated that yesterday he received a telegram from the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Minister to China informing him that the President of the country had issued an emergency order on March 12, announcing the national flag. Before a concrete decision is made, the black, white, and red tricolor flag, representing Germany's past glory, and the swastika flag, representing the German nation's struggle for rebirth, are allowed to be displayed simultaneously. Therefore, today, the unified German federal symbol, the black, white, and red tricolor flag, is re-hoisted at the Consulate General 　square, protecting German expatriates regardless of their affiliations. The German federal union, founded and flourished under this black, white, and red tricolor flag, has been tested by our fathers, brothers, sons, friends, and husbands for years. They have displayed heroic qualities, and although they eventually disarmed, they were never defeated on the battlefield. Millions of our relatives have died under it to defend their country and protect their homeland. On the occasion of its re-hoisting, I wish this black, white, and red tricolor flag, on land and sea, will proclaim our most sincere wishes and firm hopes, and will have a happy and great future. Under these three colors, may our German motherland be restored. We, compatriots in Shanghai, living far away in a foreign country, standing on the forefront of the nation, must uphold and protect the reputation and glory of our country. Therefore, on this solemn day, we reaffirm our oath, "Pledging loyalty to the motherland, sharing joys and sorrows." To our youth, on whom the future of Germany depends, who will shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country in the future, "If you do not risk your life, you will never have victory in your life." May all the youth encourage each other. After Consul White finished his speech, he introduced Hasen Zhuer, the local leader of the Nazi Party in Shanghai, to give a brief and passionate speech. Then the band played the national anthem, and the old flag of the German Empire fluttered in the wind and ascended to the top of the large flagpole in the consulate general square. The Nazi Party flag was also hoisted on the flagpole in the southwest corner of the consulate general building. The party's stormtroopers then saluted the flag, sang the party anthem, and withdrew, thus ending the simple, solemn ceremony.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education Sector Cables Request to Punish Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>If You Want to Slightly Correct National Discipline and Order</p>
<p>You Must Sentence Zhang to Public Execution</p>
<p>Jiang Hengyuan, Ni Wenya, Zheng XuanShan, Zhang Zhonghuan, Jia Foru, Yang Weiyu, Shi Xigu, Lu Shaoji, Ou Yuanhuai and over three hundred and twenty other people in the municipal education sector yesterday sent a telegram to the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, the Military Commission, etc., requesting that Zhang Xueliang be sentenced to the ultimate penalty. The original text is as follows: To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Military Commission: The brutal Japanese had already occupied the three northeastern provinces and declared their intention to attack Rehe. For a year, they have been preparing for war with the intention of invading the west. This is what the whole country has seen and heard. Our government has repeatedly expressed to the people its determination to resist for a long time, and has planned the whole plan. It has completely entrusted the heavy responsibility of the frontier to Zhang Xueliang alone. Zhang Xueliang has received national support for generations. Whether he sacrifices himself for the country is his duty. He should also gnash his teeth and try to avenge his father's murder by the Japanese in Huanggu Tun. However, after Shenyang fell, instead of thinking about recovering the lost territory, he first asked the enemy to return his private property. Foreign newspapers were spreading the news, causing shock and horror. Then Jinzhou was lost, and he handed it over with both hands. Yuguan was lost again, and he retreated after a brief battle. He usually indulged in sensual pleasures and lived comfortably in the old capital, putting military and national affairs aside. His subordinates were disloyal, and the people complained. When the situation in Rehe became urgent, the whole country was panicked, and people far and near joined forces and went to aid. Zhang Xueliang held an important military position, dispatched troops, and claimed to have prepared well. However, when the enemy invaded the west, the entire front collapsed in less than ten days. What did Zhang Xueliang do? What was the so-called preparation? For Zhang Xueliang himself, he should have been ashamed and committed suicide long ago to apologize to the people of the country and comfort the dead 　. But this cannot be expected of a shameless person. Zhang Xueliang's personal actions are not worthy of pity. What about the face of the country? What about the national discipline? If our government wants to preserve the face of the country and correct the national discipline and order, and if the entire 470 million people can still survive in the world, it should resolutely order Zhang Xueliang to be sentenced to the ultimate penalty. We must know that today there is no lack of usable military hearts, and there is no lack of reliable popular sentiment. It is only because the harmful horse is not removed and the evil seedling is not eliminated that even if there is an army, there is no way to kill the enemy, and even if there are people, there is no way to resist regret. Since the September 18th Incident, the loss of national face and the abandonment of discipline have occurred more than once. To publicly execute Zhang Xueliang is the minimum requirement. If the government is unwilling to do even this minimum, then how can we bear to talk about the future of the nation? We make this urgent statement, hoping that you will take note of it.</p>
<h3>Standards for Dou Rice Determined</h3>
<p>Will be announced by the Party and Government today</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the strike by rice merchants transporting rice from southern and northern Shanghai was mediated by the Party and Government several times. As a result, the Husi used the flat Dou method as a temporary transition. On the one hand, the Party and Government agencies consulted on the flat Dou standard for public announcement and compliance. It is now known that the consultation was completed yesterday, with roughly four to nine he being considered a flat Dou, below four he being considered a light Dou, and above nine he being considered a heavy Dou. The standard will be announced today, ordering rice merchants to implement it and not to violate it.</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection Association Convenes Citywide Labor Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Labor Unions Make Empty Promises</p>
<p>The Central China Factory Inspection Association convened a meeting of various labor unions in the city yesterday at 2 PM at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss factory inspection matters. Representatives from over thirty organizations including the General Labor Union, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Union, the City Dyeing Industry Union, the City Leather Manufacturing Union, the City Hotel and Restaurant Industry Union, the City Pharmaceutical Industry Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Rolling Union, the Tenth District Cotton Spinning Union, the Third District Cotton Spinning Industry Union, and the Southern Goods Labor Union attended, including Lu Keming, Chen Xiupu, Xu Yan Gong, Zhang Yuanming, Lu Muqin, Li Hua, Wang Zhuping, Li Jilin, Yu Yaoqiu, and over forty others. First, the chairman of the association, Tian Heqing, gave a report, followed by a close discussion on effective methods to unify inspection authority throughout the city. The representatives were visibly pleased as the matter concerned the interests of laborers. Concrete decisions were made regarding future progress. It is reported that the Factory Inspection Association is scheduled to host the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Bar Association, the YMCA, and other public organizations this afternoon.</p>
<p>Various labor unions in the city, due to the obstruction by the concession authorities against our government's factory inspections, which infringe upon sovereignty, yesterday issued a joint declaration, stating that since the rise of mechanical industry, our laborers have been groaning under factory life, with unequal distribution and livelihoods increasingly impoverished. Social ills have led to instability. For a long time, the nation has been formulating labor laws and regulations to establish employer-employee relations, making up for the inadequacy of free contracts so that both labor and capital can be interconnected and mutually supportive, advancing together toward prosperity and happiness. The intention is profound and far-reaching. Our nation's industry is still in its infancy, and the development of labor law is also slower than in other countries. However, in recent years, our government, recognizing the needs of the times, has been weighing the urgency of various labor laws and regulations, and issuing them in order. Because local official organs may not be able to oversee everything, and despite good laws and intentions, there is concern that they may become mere formalities, the Factory Inspection Law was promulgated in 1931 to ensure the effective implementation of other labor laws and regulations. Last year, due to the invasion of Shanghai by the violent Japanese, the inspection work in the city was delayed. Our laborers eagerly awaited the implementation of factory inspections. Fortunately, our government agencies, deeply aware of the importance of this matter, immediately began to actively proceed with it as soon as the war ceased and the overall situation stabilized. Just as our laborers were rejoicing, the authorities of the Special District disregarded our national sovereignty and came forward to obstruct, secretly plotting to revise Article 34 of the Supplementary Regulations of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, forcing the factories in the Special District and their affiliated laborers to be under their control. The history of imperialists oppressing and trampling on our laborers is clear. As long as our laborers have a breath left, they will definitely struggle to break free from the constraints of the imperialists. Considering that this city is the industrial center of the country, and that the factories in the Special District account for the majority of the factories in the city, the focus is on inciting the other party's covetousness. Taking advantage of the fact that the disputes from the past have not yet been resolved, they are using various means to muddy the waters, so that our country's industry, in addition to being constrained by unequal treaties, will be subject to this additional layer of constraints. It is truly disheartening to speak of it. Fortunately, people from all walks of life have risen up to oppose it, and we hope that our government will resolutely and decisively unify the factory inspection power and dispatch personnel to inspect the factories in the Special District as soon as possible, without further delay or hesitation, lest the opportunity be missed. Our laborers will certainly support and advance, making strong and forceful resistance. If the authorities of the Special District are stubborn and create unnecessary obstacles, the labor sector will seek to demonstrate its entire strength, and will not stop until the goal is achieved. This declaration is made by the Steamship Wood Industry Association, the Ninth District Soap and Medicine Labor Union, the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamship Cabin Staff Labor Union, the Fifth District Shipbuilding Labor Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Rolling Labor Union, the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Labor Union, the First District Shipbuilding Labor Union, the Sauce Industry Labor Union, the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union, the Postal Service Labor Union, the Postal Workers Union, the Tenth District Cotton Spinning Labor Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Rolling Labor Union, the Southern Goods Trade Labor Union, the First District Knitting Labor Union, the Ninth District Woodworking Labor Union, the Bone Utensil Labor Union, the Tea and Food Labor Union, the First District Sanitation Industry Labor Union, the Toothbrush Labor Union, the First District Paper Manufacturing Labor Union, the Ninth District Cement Labor Union, the First District Rubber Labor Union, the Pig Bristle Labor Union, the Garment Industry Labor Union, the Second District Knitting Labor Union, the Incense Industry Labor Union, the Customs Broker Labor Union, the First District Water and Electricity Labor Union, the Third District Silk Industry Labor Union, the Third District Silk Reeling Labor Union, the Fourth District Sanitation Labor Union, the Sixth District Silk Reeling Labor Union, the Sixth District Woodworking Labor Union, the Sixth District Public Bus Labor Union, the Sixth District Tea Manufacturing Labor Union, the Hu Meter Industry Labor Union, the District Silk Weaving Industry Labor Union, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Labor Union, the Third District Water and Electricity Labor Union, the Fourth District Water and Electricity Labor Union, the Fourth District Shipbuilding Labor Union, the Seventh District Woodworking Labor Union, the Sixth District Woodworking Labor Union, the Fourth District Silk Weaving Labor Union, the China Merchants Bureau Fifth Wharf Workers Union, the Tenth District Silk Industry Labor Union, the Third District Silk Industry Labor Union, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Labor Union, the Dyeing Industry Labor Union, the Mercerizing Office, the Leather Manufacturing Industry Labor Union, the Hotel and Restaurant Labor Union, the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union, the Third District Cotton Spinning Industry Labor Union, the Clothing Industry Labor Union, the Yarn Industry Labor Union, the Coal Industry Labor Union, the Qinlan Labor Union, the Duck Slaughtering Industry Labor Union, the Stone Printing Industry Labor Union, the Civil Ship Repairing Labor Union, the Industry Labor Union, the Fifth District Loading and Unloading Labor Union, the Fifth District Cotton Spinning Industry, the Fifth District Cotton Weaving Labor Union, the First District Cotton Weaving Labor Union, the Second District Cotton Weaving Labor Union, the Silver Working Industry Labor Union, the First District Transport Industry Labor Union, the First District Woodworking Industry Labor Union, the Fifth District Woodworking Industry Labor Union, the Fourth District Transport Labor Union, the City Silk Spinning Industry Labor Union, the Hat Manufacturing Industry Labor Union, the Ink Manufacturing Industry Labor Union, the Sixth District Water and Electricity Labor Union, and others.</p>
<h3>Gold Exchange Announces Implementation of Silver Dollar Standard</h3>
<p>The Gold Exchange's margin trading has been calculated in taels. Now, due to the implementation of the silver dollar standard, the exchange, at the time of yesterday's rollover, announced the implementation of changing taels to dollars through the Brokers Association. The announcement is recorded below. For the convenience of April's trading procedures, it has been agreed with the Board of Directors to temporarily calculate settlement at the tael price, and then convert the account to silver dollars, with the 16th as the deadline. After that, any rollover transactions will be calculated in silver dollars. We hope you will be aware of this.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Amendment to Partnership Debt Law</h3>
<p>Seeking Fairness in Legislative Policy</p>
<p>Suitable for the Current Economic Environment</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Court for the amendment of the law on joint and several liability for partnership debts. The original text reads: "Regarding the petition, the commercial organization of our country, apart from sole proprietorships, is mostly composed of partnerships. Since the introduction of the European and American systems into China, imitations have begun and companies have been organized. However, their scope is limited to only one or two out of hundreds in major cities. The organization of the vast majority of businesses still follows the partnership system. Legislation must always consider human sentiment. Especially now, with the bankruptcy of agriculture and the concentration of inland capital in cities, it is not appropriate to transplant European and American practices and force customs to be unbearable, causing those with a little capital to turn away, fearing the danger of joint property liquidation when investing in commerce. It is better to concentrate in cities and operate other businesses, which can still provide a certain degree of security. If this idea takes root in people's hearts, it will further accelerate the collapse of inland commerce. Therefore, legislation must not only conform to human sentiment, but also consider the environment at the time. This is what is meant by legislative policy. In the past, the debts of partnerships in our country were proportionally shared, that is, distributed according to shares. Since the authority of the Mixed Court of the International Settlement was controlled by foreigners, cases of Sino-foreign lawsuits were often judged with joint and several liability for partnership debts, causing great uproar and years of controversy. The former Supreme Court also took into account public sentiment and made an interpretation that reconciled joint sharing. Unexpectedly, the subsequent promulgation of Article 618 of the Civil Code's Debt Section stipulated that each partner is jointly liable for the amount of the shortfall. From the principle of equal protection of creditor and debtor rights, it does not seem that there should be any bias. Partnership debts, compared to proportionate sharing, encounter creditors at most, who can collect only a percentage of the payment. While generally having considerable interest payments, such as in commerce, if this turns out to be unavoidable it is in accordance with reason and law. The creditor's investment is not necessarily concentrated in one shop. Even if there is a discount for repayment, it is unlikely to lead to bankruptcy. If debtors are held jointly and severally liable, creditors can be picky, getting full repayment of principal and interest, while debtors, even if they are bankrupt, are not enough to bear joint and several liquidation on behalf of other partners, which will inevitably affect other partnership businesses, leading to a standstill. Comparing the two, how generous is the treatment of creditors, and how cruel is the treatment of debtors? Is this the original intention of equal treatment? People generally believe that investing in fields and houses, even if there is a disaster, the loss is only the invested fields and houses, which is enough to protect their entire assets. If they engage in business as a partnership, they are at any time in danger of joint liability and bankruptcy. Why not go to safety and avoid danger? This is guiding people to concentrate cash in cities, making them afraid to invest in commerce. This policy is truly dangerous. Some may retort that in this way, creditor rights are not guaranteed, and who would be willing to lend their funds to stores? This is just an excuse. The result of proportionate sharing is at most a discount on repayment, and lending is definitely not concentrated in one store. The creditor should not be unduly protected at the expense of the debtor going bankrupt and unable to pay. This is the fair attitude that legislative policy should have. Speaking of the interests of businessmen themselves, there are lenders and borrowers. Are creditor and debtor rights not as different as heaven and earth? Therefore, the stipulation of joint liability for partnerships is not stubbornly opposed because it is not beneficial to the business community. What we are fighting for is fairness in legislative policy and suitability for the current economic environment. Based on the above reasons, the Standing Committee and the Joint Supervisory Committee of the Association on the tenth of this month decided to submit a request to the Legislative Yuan to amend the provisions on joint liability for partnership debts. We now submit this case for your review and approval, so that the request can be handled as requested, which is in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Continued Issuance of Two Important Letters from the Zheng Yonghe Tragedy Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Zheng Tai Yonghe Tragedy All-City Rubber Workers Relief Association, after sending letters to the Public Concession Bureau of Works and the Chinese Ratepayers Association the day before yesterday, has now sent two important letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Rubber Industry Association. The general idea is that the factory must bear the expenses for the families of the deceased workers and the burial expenses of the unlisted workers.</p>

<h3>Two Important Letters from the Second Special District Municipal Federation</h3>
<p>House Rent Should Be Calculated in Silver Dollars</p>
<p>Order the Health Department to Punish Cautiously</p>
<p>According to reports from the district branches of the Civil Federation of the Second Special District (French Concession) in the city, the tax collection office of the French Bureau of Works still calculates tax payments in taels, which converts to a reduced silver price, causing significant losses to citizens throughout the district. Now that the conversion of taels to dollars has been implemented, there is a real need for reform. In addition, in the Health Department, there are often those who are penalized for improper dumping of garbage, without any prior warning, which is very likely to cause misunderstandings. After receiving the reports, the Federation sent separate letters to the Bureau of Works and the Public Works Bureau for correction. The two letters are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Letter to the French Bureau of Works:</p>
<p>Sir, We are informed by the Fifth District Branch that the conversion of taels to dollars has been implemented since March 10th. Our city's tax authorities and various industries all calculate in silver dollars, but the concession authorities have not yet indicated that they will abolish taels for dollars in taxes. At the same time, when the tax collectors collect house rent each time, the conversion from taels to silver dollars often does not follow the market price. They deliberately lower the silver price, privately enriching themselves. The losses suffered by our citizens over the years are not insignificant. We request that your association forward this to the French Bureau of Works to negotiate for. Considering the difficulties of the people, the tax collection office should be ordered to immediately calculate house rent in silver dollars, to lighten the burden of the citizens and comply with the order. This is to maintain public friendship. This is addressed to the French Bureau of Works.</p>
<p>Letter to the French Public Works Bureau:</p>
<p>Sir, We are informed by the Sixth District Branch that the number of cases of punishment of citizens by the Health Bureau of the French Concession has been increasing recently. The reason is that they are arbitrarily punished for violating the regulations by dumping garbage. However, when the bureau's personnel see garbage, they do not investigate in detail, nor do they give warnings. They immediately copy the house number, and if the citizen has not clarified the truth and has not been punished by the bureau, the bureau then notifies the police, and the fine is doubled, otherwise they are sued in court. Many of these situations are misunderstandings. We request that your association forward this to the French Public Works Bureau to negotiate and appease the citizens. We found that citizens may have improper garbage disposal behavior but the health bureau manages sanitation and should first inform the citizens. How can they abuse their authority and arbitrarily punish them? The citizens of this district cannot bear the harassment. Based on the aforementioned situation, we hereby request that your bureau order the Health Department to conduct detailed investigations before handling the garbage disposal method in the future, and to give warnings in advance, and not to misidentify arbitrarily, in order to appease the citizens. This is to maintain public friendship. This is addressed to the French Public Works Bureau.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Hanging from Electric Pole; Woman Mourns at Corpse</h3>
<p>Deceased Identified as Her Husband</p>
<p>Unable to Pay Four Dollars in Rent</p>
<p>Living in Poverty and Starvation</p>
<p>Suicide Due to Despair Is Truly Tragic</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a middle-aged man was found hanging from an electric pole on Xibaoxing Road in Zhabei, causing a commotion throughout the street. Before long, a woman rushed out from the crowd, mourning at the corpse. The woman claimed to be the deceased's wife, with the name Yin Tangshi. The deceased, Yin Abao, was 39 years old, from Zhenjiang. He lived in a small room at No. 3 Yongxingfang, Qingyun Road. Her husband used to sell vegetables, but the occupation was low-paying and profits were minimal. In addition, the high donation taxes and the expense of living meant they constantly struggled with starvation. The room they lived in required a monthly rent of four dollars. They were always worried about being unable to pay the rent. They already owed four dollars in back rent. The landlord, of course, did not care whether they had money or not, and pressured them daily, causing her husband to commit suicide out of despair. After speaking, she cried uncontrollably. The police officer, seeing this tragic scene, immediately took the woman to the Ninth District for questioning and then ordered the local Baozhang Yan Liugen to report to the Local Court. Prosecutor Xie and others were commissioned to inspect the scene, and the family was instructed to collect the body.</p>

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Hosts Banquet for Exhibitors Participating in the Chicago Exposition</h3>
<p>The night before last, Wu Zhihao, general manager of the Shanghai National Products Company, across from the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, hosted a banquet at Mei Yuan for all exhibitors of the Chicago Exposition Exhibit Association. The guests included Zhou Guanhong, Wang Songyou, Hu Zupeng, and He Wuwu from the porcelain industry; Dong Kunfan, Wu Guangzhi, and Dong Guangying from the lacquerware industry; Wang Zhengji, Liu Houmin, and Tong Rixin from the Xiang embroidery industry; Wang Songpu from the pottery industry; business figures Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Lin Kanghou; and Zhang Zilian from the national products industry, among more than forty others. First, Chairman Wu Zhihao delivered a speech, stating that it was a pity that our country's participation in the Chicago Exposition had been stopped due to the government's concentration of financial resources on national crises. Nevertheless, in order to develop overseas trade and maintain international credibility, all exporters resolutely joined together to carefully select one-third of the excellent products to participate in the meeting alone. This not only demonstrates the determination of our people to promote national products, but also promotes the true spirit of our national products in the international arena. There is unlimited light in the future of the country. In order to celebrate the victory of the country, he prepared a humble feast and asked the business figures Lao Qia and others to find ways to request the government to allocate funds within the possible scope, and to negotiate with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and syndicates to provide assistance so that the business can be successfully completed without disappointing everyone's enthusiasm. In addition, if the remaining two-thirds of the products cannot participate, our company will find ways to vigorously promote the sales. Next, Zhou Guanhong, director of the association, reported on the preparations and stated the significance of participating, roughly saying that the main products of our country in international trade have always been silk, magnetic lotus lacquerware carpets, oil embroidery carvings, etc. Each time they participate in international exhibitions, they often lack detailed explanations and systematic organization, so that foreigners only know what it is but don't know why it is. There is no place to close deals with people looking to order in bulk so in recent years, foreign trade has been at a loss. With this in mind, we will list each of the competition products, add detailed explanations, such as observing the color, smelling the aroma, and then tasting the flavor of tea. In the future, in order to make the trip to Chicago and plan for the entire development, we will also demarcate a suitable location nearby to establish a permanent sales agency. Finally, it was mentioned that since coming to Shanghai, the colleagues have received assistance from national goods organizations, and they have come to negotiate one after another, and they are willing to promote various products of the Association without sparing any effort to love and protect national goods. The colleagues are deeply grateful, etc. Finally, Mr. Yu Qiaqing gave a speech saying that the government's cancellation of participation in the Chicago Exposition made us feel infinitely disappointed. Today, the people of China make great efforts, do not consider everything, and are determined to participate. The spirit of courage is admirable. As for those of us with no ability, we will do our best to appeal to the government and to negotiate with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance. At eight o'clock, everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

<h3>Circular from the Silk Industry Guild to Members Regarding Transactions Calculated in Silver Dollars</h3>

However, the matter is of great importance and requires vast sums of money. The Society recently sent letters to leaders from all sectors of the city, appealing for them to widely solicit donations.

<p>Settlement in Italian Lawsuit Against Xue Jinyuan</p>
<p>Madam Xue Jinyuan, known for her social skills, was recently sued by an Italian named You Wei Wu, the general manager of the China-Italy Shipping Company, for enticing his son, Ji Shi Fu. The First Special District Court scheduled a hearing for 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Zehan, who specially opened the Eighth Court to convene the two parties for trial. However, since the You and Xue families claimed to be acquainted, their friendship was obviously not superficial. Although a lawsuit arose due to a temporary rift, once friendly intermediaries mediated between the two sides, the misunderstanding was quickly resolved. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a settlement was reached. The plaintiff, You Wei Wu, instructed his attorney, Yang Ruinian, to prepare a petition to withdraw the complaint and submit it to the court, requesting the withdrawal of the private prosecution. Judge Wu approved the petition, stating that "the case has been withdrawn by the private prosecutor and therefore should not be accepted."</p>
<p>At the height of their gambling excitement, there were about fifty or sixty gamblers. Unexpectedly, the hotel waiter, Gu Azu, upon seeing the detectives, fled into the room to notify them.

<h3>Servant Scares People with a Gunny Sack</h3>
<p>Threatens to Stuff Him in the Sack and Throw Him into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Zhu Yuyun, a Shandong native, 29 years old, was a servant at 246 Rue Picquet in the French Concession. Recently, he was dismissed by his employer due to a mistake. Zhu suspected that Feng Wenzhao, a fellow servant in Room 14, had instigated his dismissal, and therefore harbored resentment. On the afternoon of the 14th, at around 1:00 PM, he gathered four or five fellow villagers and colleagues, including Sun Yizhi and Zhao Baosheng, and took a gunny sack to Feng's place. They demanded 100 yuan from Feng, threatening that if he did not comply, they would kill him. While they were arguing, Feng's employer returned home, learned of the situation, and reported it to the police. The detectives arrested Zhu, Sun, and Zhao, while the others escaped. Zhu and the others, along with the sack, were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, stating that the police were prosecuting the defendants for crimes such as intimidation and fraud. The first defendant, Zhu, recently lost his job and suspected that the plaintiff had instigated his dismissal. Therefore, he harbored resentment and, along with the second and third defendants and others who are still at large, went to the plaintiff's place, threatening to extort 100 yuan, or else they would stuff the plaintiff into the gunny sack and throw him into the Huangpu River. The plaintiff's employer, a foreigner, returned home, learned of the situation, and reported it to the police, who arrested the defendants. Because the investigation is not yet concluded and there are still fugitives at large, he requested a postponement of the hearing. Judge Wu Fanglian briefly questioned the defendants and then ordered a postponement of the trial until the 23rd. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Wang Weichang, a native of Ningbo, 48 years old, residing at No. 523, Five-Rooms-Deep, Changxing Lane, Rotten Mud Ferry Road, Pudong, is a chief steward on a ship and therefore rarely returns home. His wife, Wang Zhang, 41 years old, lives at home with a daughter named Yubao (13 years old). Last year, a fellow villager, Wu Yongqing (30 years old), became an intimate guest. Wang Zhang claimed that he was her half-brother, so he has been living there for more than a year. In reality, he is Wang Zhang's lover. Unexpectedly, Wu Yongqing's affair with Wang Zhang was witnessed by Yubao, who could not help but talk about it. Wu then incited Wang Zhang to kill the girl in order to silence her. Wang Zhang could not bear to do so, so Wu beat her and injured Yubao, almost crippling her. As a result, the neighbors were outraged and reported it to Wang Weichang. Yesterday morning, they helped Wang break into the room and catch the adulterers red-handed. The adulterous couple was beaten severely. The police were notified and brought the adulterer and adulteress to the Third District Police Station, who transferred them to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

A robber named Chen Zhangda, a native of Ningbo, was arrested. He confessed the location of his accomplices. They then took the robber as an informant to Zilaihuo Street, first going to No. 9 Zhizhong Lane to arrest an accomplice, Zhang Boqing, a native of Zhenjiang (who worked as a detective in the Jiangsu Water Police). Unexpectedly, Zhang had already received a warning upstairs. He grabbed a gun and came downstairs to escape. When he reached the foot of the stairs, he saw the detectives had arrived. He attempted to open fire to resist arrest. Fortunately, the detectives were quick and alert. Seeing the situation, they rushed forward and grabbed Zhang, preventing him from firing the gun. They managed to subdue him and handcuff his hands. Two pistols, nineteen bullets, and over ten stolen items (mostly worthless fake jewelry; valuable items had already been pawned off and divided) were seized at his home.</p>
<p>A detective certificate issued by Yi Qing, the captain of the anti-smuggling third platoon of the fourth district patrol unit of the Jiangsu Water Police, dated February 1, 1933, was also found on his person.

It was also discovered that Zhang Boqing had previously committed robbery in the International Settlement, sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, and released not long ago. He pretended to be a detective, but was secretly committing robberies. The chief of the western district ordered them to be detained pending trial in court.</p>

<h3>Where is the Path for Impoverished Normal School Students?</h3>
<p>From Mr. Yin Riyan's Report</p>
<p>I have a question that I would like to trouble you with your energy and time to answer! I am a soon-to-be-graduated normal school student. In this society full of contradictions, the issue of a path after graduation is unusually important. In theory, a normal school student should take on the educational duties they have been instilled with and work as an elementary school teacher to spread education. There is no disagreement about this. However, in a society still being attacked by the remnants of feudal forces, can you, a young man without any power or money, find a well-equipped elementary school where you can serve adequately? Not possible! What about the Provincial Experimental Elementary School? Even less possible! Because those positions are only available to normal school students, even middle school graduates, with so-called 'social status'. At best, a poor kid will be sent to an ordinary rural elementary school where the salary is only eleven or twelve yuan, the school location is extremely remote and narrow, and you are often owed several months' salary or given several worthless IOUs. Can you maintain your minimum living standards with that? Can you support your wife and children? It's truly like falling into the 'eighteenth level of hell'—a dead end! Taking a step back, even if you can muster the so-called 'spirit of sacrifice,' not fearing cold or hunger, not fearing hardship, and stubbornly go ahead, can you, with a clear conscience, use the pseudo-knowledge you've been taught to numb those children full of new life, especially the children in the countryside who will be the future revolutionary forces? Can you have the skill of flattery to welcome those local tyrants, landlords, and the directors and members of the educational administrative bodies? Otherwise, you will be asked to resign and go home to take care of the children! In short, this so-called 'applying what you have learned' path for normal school graduates is not very promising. At this point, the teacher might ask me, can't you further your studies? But I already explained above that I am a poor kid, and in today's society where education is a capitalist aristocracy, I certainly don't have the right to further my studies! Even if there are one or two universities that claim to help poor young people, where do you get the pocket money and exam fees? Who will take care of the family expenses for you? And are you willing to become a commodity like opium or alcohol, produced by the universities of today's society? So, let alone not having money, even if I had money, I would not want to enter this kind of university! At this point, the teacher will definitely ask me again: If you clearly understand that there is no way out for you in today's society, why don't you take on the mission of the times and strive for society? However, I also have a point to discuss with the teacher: Where are the true leaders in the ranks of those striving for society today? Where are those who can truly awaken the masses? I feel that the so-called enlightened young people I have come into contact with are just small-bourgeois individuals with the intentions of loving someone, wearing Western suits, making money, and pursuing profit, doing things that are falsely advertised. Not only can they not approach and lead the masses, but they only know how to enjoy themselves. Can you join forces with this kind of person? Can you go along with them? I need to eat every day, and I can't tighten my belt and take on the mission of the times to strive! Therefore, being caught in this mixed and contradictory situation from which I cannot extricate myself, I humbly ask the teacher for guidance on a way out.</p>
<p>Answer: With China's economy being rapidly pushed toward bankruptcy under the oppression of international capitalist imperialism, it is naturally impossible to talk about any progress in education. So, the fate of normal school students is also predictable. Primary normal school students are always the teachers of elementary schools, and the suffering of elementary school teachers cannot be avoided in any country, let alone in China. For example, in Shanghai, each elementary school teacher's monthly salary is at most about thirty yuan. After paying for housing and food, there is hardly anything left. Adding in necessary pocket money, eight or nine out of ten months are extremely difficult. If they have a wife and children, then they can only let them drink the northwest wind. The life of elementary school teachers in Shanghai, the only major metropolis in the country, is like this, and the interior is even more indescribable. This problem is not a simple education problem, but the entire political problem, the entire social system problem. Naturally, our elementary school teachers should all strive for their own interests, but we must know that one's own problems cannot be solved without leaving the entire political and social problem. Of course, one cannot strive to take on the mission of the times' with an empty stomach. However, if you do not do this kind of struggle, you will still go hungry, and most people will go hungry. Those who are not hungry or have no experience of going hungry, or those who have compassion for those who are hungry, who would be willing to take on the mission of the times'? Looking at the situation in Shanghai, not only do most normal school students have no way out, but even most university graduates, and even students who have studied in Europe and America, often cannot find a job paying thirty or forty yuan. What other way can we save this panic phenomenon except to demand reform of the status quo? This is an important social problem that is specially put forward for the public to discuss.</p>

<p>Seize the Opportunity to Study Hard Amid National Crisis</p>
<p>Bear the Heavy Responsibility of Saving the Country</p>
<p>New President Guo Renyuan Arrives at the University to Assume Office</p>
<p>Firmly Retains Shen Yizhai to Continue as Secretary-General</p>
<p>President Cheng of Zhejiang University gave a farewell speech to the students, saying, "I am very happy to be able to meet with you all today. Since I arrived in Nanchang, due to various circumstances, I have not been able to leave Zhejiang University, which makes me somewhat reluctant to part. I did not expect that I would have another opportunity to speak here today, so I am very happy, but at the same time very sad. Whether from my personal wishes or from the perspective of the future of the university, I myself am very willing to continue serving at this university. However, I cannot get rid of other affairs. These reasons and difficulties have been explained in detail in the previous two telegrams, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>My departure from Zhejiang University this time is completely involuntary and against my own will. If I firmly refused the duties of the Hubei Education Department, the discomfort in my own heart would be harmful to the future of the school. Therefore, I obey the government's orders to go to Hubei to take office. However, the pain in my heart is truly unbearable. I have only been away from Hangzhou for a little over a month. You can see my complexion now. It's so haggard. Recently, I have rested a little on the road, so it is a little better. When I was in Nanchang, it was even worse. I was in Nanchang because of mental pain, so I left after only seven days. If I was not suffering in Nanchang, then why would I leave? These are only for me personally. Speaking to the students of the school, I feel very ashamed. When I received the telegrams from my colleagues in Nanchang asking me to stay, I was very happy in my heart.</p>
<p>Now, because I am forced to leave Zhejiang University, it has been over a month. In the past month, thanks to the efforts of Secretary Shen, the deans of the various colleges, all the faculty and staff, and all the students, the school has been maintained and is progressing. All school affairs have not been stagnated because of my departure. I am very grateful. If Zhejiang University is affected because of my departure, wouldn't that make my pain even greater? Now that the school has not been affected, this makes me a little happier in my pain.</p>
<p>Since I took office last April until now, it has been eleven months. In the past short period, everyone can see what I have done. My principle in doing things is this: do what should be done, and don't do what shouldn't be done. In mid-November, students often came to request various matters. All reasonable requests were granted. All things that I thought were unnecessary or should not be done were explained and canceled. I never wanted to please the students and grant everything indiscriminately. All the students have seen this personally. Now that I am leaving, everyone does not resent me for not being able to please the students, but instead send telegrams to ask me to stay. This makes me feel an infinite pleasure. If I was at the school when the Ministry of Education issued... (rest of sentence is cut off).</p>

<h3>Summary of the Fourth Implementation Method</h3>
<p>(I) Key Teaching Points</p>
<p>(1) The teaching of each part should start from the content of junior high school physics, gradually introducing preliminary methods used in physics, enabling students to further understand physical phenomena. The teaching materials should by no means be a pocket-sized abridgment of university physics. (2) During lectures, be sure to conduct simple experiments and demonstrations to help students understand the meaning of each principle. (3) Be sure to enable students to thoroughly understand the meaning of each principle and definition, and do not have them simply memorize sentences. (4) Special attention should be paid to the applications of physics, without high-flown discussions of theories and doctrines. (5) Teachers should lead students to visit places related to the application of physics. (6) Teachers should create or select simple and practical problems and exercises to enable students to know how to use each principle to solve them. Students should be urged to submit calculation exercises on designated days of the week and return them after detailed correction. (7) Students should be encouraged to ask questions. Whenever students ask questions, teachers should create easier-to-solve problems to gradually guide them to solving their own difficulties. (8) If the number of students exceeds 20, the problem discussion should be divided into several groups, with a maximum of 20 people in each group. During grouping, students of comparable abilities (as determined by junior high school physics grades and junior and senior high school mathematics grades) should be divided into the same group. (9) Written tests should be held frequently. The test questions should be mainly calculation and explanation questions, and questions involving memorizing definitions and laws should be avoided.</p>
<p>(II) Experimental Teaching Materials</p>
<p>(1) Measurement of length (usage of vernier calipers) (2) Usage of balances (density and specific gravity of regular solids) (3) Spring scales and Hooke's Law (4) Specific gravity of solids and liquids and Archimedes' principle (5) Relationship between liquid pressure and depth (6) Specific gravity of liquids (Hare's method) (7) Boyle's Law (8) Construction of barometers (to be assembled by students) (9) Chinese steelyard (10) Parallelogram law of forces (11) Statics and motion of objects on an inclined plane (12) Combination of pulleys and their efficiency (13) Simple pendulum (14) Pressure and boiling point (15) Specific heat of metals and calorimeters (16) Linear expansion of brass rods (17) Expansion of gases (18) Humidity (19) Heat of fusion of ice (20) Heat of vaporization of water (21) Mechanical equivalent of heat (22) Adiabatic process (23) Resonance of air columns, beats (24) Reflection of light (25) Photometer (26) Refractive index of water and glass (27) Images formed by mirrors (28) Lenses (29) Dispersion of light by prisms (30) Magnetic field (31) Batteries (32) How to charge batteries (33) Electroplating (34) Resistance and its connection method (usage of Wheatstone bridge) (35) Magnetic effect of current (construction of a simple galvanometer, usage of ammeters and voltmeters) (36) Electrical power and thermal energy (37) Electric bell connection method (telegraph usage) (38) Induced current (39) Electric motor principle (40) Radio crystal receiver (to be assembled by students using various components) (41) Vacuum tube detector (to be assembled by students using various components)</p>
<p>(III) Points to Note for Experiments</p>
<p>(1) It is not necessary to do all of the above experiments, but each person must do at least ten experiments throughout the year. The experiments selected should be based on the student's environment. Their nature should be evenly distributed among the following four categories: (1) Determining the causes and effects of various phenomena (2) Proving the quantitative relationship of laws and regulations (3) Practical problems (4) Construction of simple instruments by students themselves. (2) The instruments used do not need to be very precise, but the results observed should be as accurate as possible. (3) The results of the experiments must be recorded in appropriate tables to train students to make systematic records. (4) Whenever seeking quantitative relationships, students must estimate and calculate the errors of their results. (5) Special attention should be paid to the rounding of significant digits and shortcut calculation methods. (6) Students should understand the purpose of each step of the experiment and must not simply copy from experiment manuals.</p>

<h3>Construction of School Buildings for Zhenhai Liyi Primary School</h3>
<p>Liyi Private Primary School in the Seventh District of Zhenhai has always borrowed civilian houses, which has been inconvenient for mathematics education. The gentry of the school, Hu Funan, Cao Ziquan, Cao Xinzhi, Cao Zuancheng, and others, in view of this situation, jointly contributed ten thousand taels of silver to build formal school buildings. They have already completed the design and recruited construction workers and materials, with a deadline of April 28th for completion. The enthusiasm of these merchants for their hometown education is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Peace-Tianjin Education Federation</p>
<h3>Launching the Establishment of the National Anti-Japanese General Association</h3>
<p>Mou Mo Has Confidence in Contacts in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Jinan</p>
<p>National Education Federation Holds Inaugural Conference in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) Mou Mo, a liaison representative of the Peace-Tianjin National College and University Teachers' Association, returned to Peiping on the 11th from Hangzhou, having passed through Jinan, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The educational circles and the public express considerable sympathy for the Peace-Tianjin Education Federation and are unanimously seeking unity to jointly carry out a vigorous and thorough anti-Japanese movement. On the 12th, the reporter made a special trip to Representative Mou's private residence to inquire about the anti-Japanese contacts in various places. His remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>National Anti-Japanese General Association</h3>
<p>After going south, I contacted the leaders of various groups in Jinan, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, who all unanimously agreed to organize a National Anti-Japanese General Association. The anti-Japanese atmosphere in the South is quite strong, and Jinan is the best in terms of organization and construction. From the chairman to the various departments, they have a comprehensive plan for dealing with Japan. There are many Japanese residents in Qingdao, and Chairman Han's handling of the Japanese residents is quite appropriate. Shanghai has the most groups, the greatest anti-Japanese strength, and the richest economic power. This time, various parties have expressed the same willingness to provide assistance for the anti-Japanese work in various places. It is necessary for all circles in the country to unite and go to the national crisis together. Representatives of various places and groups are willing to organize the National Anti-Japanese General Association as soon as possible. Because Shanghai is home to representatives from Guangzhou, Peace-Tianjin, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces, it is planned to set up the General Association in Shanghai. Some advocate setting it up in Peiping, but Peiping's transportation is less convenient than Shanghai's. The Peace-Tianjin Education Federation will issue invitations to each province to establish Education Federations successively, and in the future, representatives will be sent to the Anti-Japanese General Association to register. It is also necessary to organize a National Federation of Teachers and Staff. Various places in the South are now actively organizing Education Federations. Those that have been established should be strengthened, and those that have not been established should be organized as soon as possible. In the South, there are University Education Federations and Middle School Education Federations. Shanghai has the University Professors Association, etc. In the future, the Education Federations in various places will unite and jointly organize the National Federation of Teachers and Staff. During the period, communicate with each other. The address for communication is the office of the Faculty of Arts of the Normal University on Shifuma Street, Peiping, forwarded to the Teachers and Staff Federation of National Colleges and Universities in Peace-Tianjin.</p>

<h3>The Seventh Day of Wang Jiyuan's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Authorities to Build an Exhibition Venue</p>
<p>Striving for the Rejuvenation of Literature and Art</p>
<p>It has been seven days since Mr. Wang's art exhibition opened at the French Library at No. 11 Huanlong Road. Literary figures, artists, and playwrights in our country who have attended the exhibition have commented that the venue is suitable for exhibitions. However, since the sovereignty is in the hands of foreigners, we should urgently seek to build our own. It is planned to petition the municipal government to build an art museum and set up a regular exhibition venue to strive for the revival of literature and art. Yesterday, Dr. Teng Gu, who jointly attended the exhibition with Mr. Wang, and Guan Baiyi, director of the Henan Museum, and celebrities such as Chen Shuren and Ye Yuhu, suggested setting up the museum to the authorities. It is also reported that Mr. Wang's extra works were replaced again yesterday with five pieces, all ink paintings of flowers and horses, which are quite unique.</p>

After the manuscript is completely sorted out, he will also invite domestic philosophers, educators, and salt specialists to correct it.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Request to Restore the Sino-Portuguese Cup Football Tournament</h3>
<p>Approved by the National Sports Association</p>
<p>To Be Held After the End of the Western League</p>
<p>Approximately on the 25th or 26th of This Month</p>
<p>The Portuguese in Shanghai are well-known in the sports world. Football is similar to the Chinese approach, and they admire each other. In 1926, the Portuguese Sports Association donated a cup and launched the Sino-Portuguese Cup. The Chinese team won the first year, and the Portuguese team won the second year. Due to the unrest of the time, or because the Portuguese had no organization, the competition was suspended. Until now, after five years, the Portuguese Sports Association consulted with the Association last month to restore the cup competition in order to enhance sports interest between China and Portugal. The matter has been approved by the board of directors of the Association and is scheduled to be held after the end of the Western League competition (approximately on the 25th or 26th). Our Chinese team will be waiting with bated breath and preparing to join this year's National Regional Football.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Board of Directors-Style League of Nations</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhitong</p>
<p>In the past, villages had boards of directors; now villages have chiefs. When disputes arise among villagers, they often act as mediators. However, their judgments are based on the people involved. For example, if both parties are "poor people," their judgments can still be fair and appropriate. But if one party is a "poor wretch" and the other is a so-called "wealthy family," even if the "wealthy family" is clearly in the wrong, the director's judgment will never be as straightforward and appropriate as when both parties are "poor people." At most, he will twist and turn and say to the "wealthy family," "Brother, this time it seems you're being a little unreasonable." This is just to appease the "poor wretch." How is the behavior of the League of Nations, grandly organized by countries around the world with the slogan of "maintaining world peace," any different from our village directors? How so? Let me give an example.</p>
<p>In 1925, Bulgaria and Greece had a conflict over border guards. Greek armed forces invaded Bulgarian territory, causing significant losses to the Bulgarian military and civilians. Angered, Bulgaria immediately ran to the League of Nations, the "director," to complain. The League of Nations quickly went to investigate and, as a result, issued a straightforward and fair judgment, saying, "Although the Greek military's invasion of Bulgarian territory was not a planned operation, it was only to retake a guard post and drive back a few soldiers. Why then launch a battle along a 20-mile front? Therefore, Greece must pay compensation of 30 million leva within two months." Although Greece was dissatisfied, they were persuaded by the British, French, and Italian ambassadors stationed in Athens and had to pay the full amount.</p>
<p>This time, the Manchurian dispute between China and Japan is far more serious than the dispute between Greece and Bulgaria. The Japanese military's invasion of China was not like the Greek military's "not a planned operation." It swallowed up three provinces in one breath and continues to seize land. It was also not like the Greek military's "launching a battle along a 20-mile front." But this time, the League of Nations, the "director," did not judge as straightforwardly and appropriately as it did in the dispute between Greece and Bulgaria. Compensation is out of the question, and even saying a "slightly unreasonable" word to Japan requires a lot of effort.</p>
<p>After more than a year of China's appeals, it finally uttered those words hesitantly.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this? Hmph! You fool! Don't you understand? Greece and Bulgaria are both "poor people," while Japan is a "wealthy family." The director has already given us face. Shouldn't we "poor wretches" be grateful to the point of tears?</p>
<h3>Women's High Hats</h3>
<p>— Sichen</p>
<p>Do They Still Need to Wear Them?</p>
<p>High hats, most people may mistakenly think of as something "profitable at first sight," but they are not. We Chinese have always had a saying, "love to wear high hats."</p>
<p>The so-called high hat does not necessarily refer to a hat of a certain size or length. The three words "high hat" are just a general term for things like "compliments" and "praise." In fact, "compliments" and "praise" are acceptable if they come from someone's sincerity, but unfortunately, most people's "compliments" and "praise" are either insincerely diligent because they want something from you, or they go against their conscience out of fear or awe of power. This "love to wear high hats" sums up the Chinese people's love of vanity in one sentence.</p>
<p>Usually, calling a lawyer "Grand Lawyer," a doctor "Grand Physician," a chief editor "Grand Editor," a senior prostitute "Grand Senior," or a benevolent person "Grand Benefactor," whether referring to others or self-referring, is all about showing how high one's hat is. Now, let's talk about women's high hats. You wouldn't believe why they have so many high hats on their heads. Just in their school days, based on their appearance or talent, they can be called "School Flower," "Queen," or "Socialite." As for the others who are called "Dancing Star," "Queen of Song," "Dramatist," or "Basketball Star," they are considered secondary. But if we analyze the root causes of this trend, we can roughly divide them into the following levels:</p>
<p>1.  It is due to men's worship of women and the curiosity that arises from an interest in the opposite sex.</p>
<p>2.  It is a situation created by women who can control more than one man with their talent to satisfy their own vanity.</p>
<p>3.  It is a distorted result produced by the emphasis on female beauty.</p>
<p>The origin of women's high hats can be easily found in the above three reasons. I wonder if self-respecting women still need to wear them.</p>
<h3>Drunk</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding</p>
<p>Lost the usual self-control.</p>
<p>There are so many Shaoxing wine shops in Shanghai that they are like carp crossing the river.</p>
<p>I made a regular customer in the XX Shaoxing wine shop next door to my company. In this leisurely environment, I got to know the temperaments of several other regular customers. One, surnamed Zhang, was very fat like me. He was a comprador at XX Foreign Firm. Every afternoon, when the day's writing was done, he would come here every day, rain or shine. I probably went around the same time, so we met every day.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was a very kind person. Just looking at his fat face, you could tell. As soon as he arrived, the slender Mr. Wu, the short Mr. Chen, and two others whose names I didn't know would also come. They always chatted and laughed every day, never talking about family琐屑 or the price of rice and salt. However, although each of them drank two or three pounds of wine every day, their demeanor was almost the same, but with an added expression of joy.</p>
<p>For those who are infatuated with Miss XX, they will forget the night, and before they know it, it is already dawn. This is a warning. Or if she permits you to meet her one day, and after receiving this wonderful news, you tidy up your appearance, shine your shoes, change your clothes, and stand upright, respectfully waiting for her arrival. But you treat it as a major event. After waiting so solemnly, she says she forgot and went her own way. If the time is over a minute, you will think that she encountered a red light on the road. If it is over thirty minutes, you will think that she is still doing her makeup and has not finished. If it is over an hour, you will think that she is sick or something. But at this time, you still won't confirm your assumptions. So you are restless, like a cat on hot bricks. This is also "drunk"! I think this is truly "drunk." Its duration is at least a few months. Being drunk on alcohol is only temporary.</p>
<h3>Hankou is Like This</h3>
<p>— Shao Qingfeng</p>
<p>Many Tribulations, No Luck</p>
<p>Hankou, an unlucky Hankou, has been through countless tribulations from the restoration until now. It is difficult to count them all. However, unlucky Hankou is still drifting in storms and struggles in vain. The market is bleak, business is sluggish, and it is now on its last breath, without vitality.</p>
<p>Let's mention some of the major ones.</p>
<p>The great fire during the restoration turned the stars in the sky red. Hundreds of miles away, only a red glow could be seen. High-rise buildings turned into a pile of tiles in an instant. This is one.</p>
<p>The official notes of Hubei Province failed completely. Wealthy families suddenly became impoverished, like "guests of honor in the morning and prisoners in the evening." This is two.</p>
<p>During the split between Ning and Hankou, the Hankou government became a mess due to raising the phase, and merchants suffered a major blow. They were confused and disoriented, and even turned their pockets inside out. The biggest blow was the Central Bank note. This is three.</p>
<p>The floods of the previous year turned Hankou into a vast swamp, almost submerging it. The outbreak after the disaster was followed by an epidemic, leaving people near death. This is four.</p>
<p>There are so many tribulations, too many to remember and too many to write down.</p>
<p>Unlucky Hankou, but it should still be considered lucky.</p>
<p>Compared to the Northeast, compared to Shanghai last year, compared to Yuguan, compared to Rehe, compared to... Oh, lucky, lucky! Let's go to the movies, go dancing, go to entertainment. Who cares about the Northeast, Shanghai, Yuguan, and Rehe?</p>
<p>However, the market is bleak, business is sluggish, and it is on its last breath, without vitality. Hankou is like this.</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two</p>
<p>Shi Jiefang Secretly Admired the Robust Elder; Quan's Family Chose a Good Match and Scolded the Poor Girl</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, just as Yuan was nodding in resentment, Mr. Gan from across the street was planning to come over to inquire about whether the clothes had been made. When he saw the old lady treating the old man so diligently and even praising Company Commander Zhao, he didn't know why, but he didn't think much of it at the time. He refused to come over to ask and avoided to the side. When the old lady turned around, she saw the back of Mr. Gan, but he had already gone far away. The old lady didn't mind this and went home to hurry and make clothes for Mr. Gan. By this afternoon, the things Zhao's family had moved in were almost completely arranged, and they heard a burst of leather shoes pattering outside the window. Then they heard someone outside the window calling out, "Mrs. Yang, our old master is here to visit you." Mrs. Jiang poked her head through the glass and looked outside. She saw Company Commander Zhao Ziqiang supporting an old man and standing outside the door. Mrs. Jiang said, "This is too much." So she greeted them. Company Commander Zhao said to his father, "This is Old Mrs. Yang." He pointed to the person behind him and said, "This is Mrs. Yang's eldest daughter." Mrs. Jiang said, "Old Master, please don't be so polite. She's called Guizhi. Just call her by her nickname." Having an old person call her name will help her grow stronger. Old Man Zhao smiled and cupped his hands, saying, "I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare! I've been hoping for a daughter all my life, but I never had one. So whenever I see someone else's daughter, I'm so envious." As he spoke, he stroked his long white beard and laughed heartily. Mrs. Jiang said, "Old Master, you have such good fortune! Your Company Commander Zhao is so good! He will definitely be promoted in the future." Old Man Zhao smiled and said, "Thank you for your good words. I'll talk to you another day. I just moved out of the city and need your guidance in many things." After speaking, he cupped his hands. Company Commander Zhao followed behind him, half-supporting and half-escorting him inside. Mrs. Jiang watched them go and said to Guizhi, "Look at how Company Commander Zhao treats his old master. You young people really need to learn from him." Guizhi laughed and said, "Learn what? I can't be a company commander." Mrs. Jiang said, "It's not that I want you to be an official, as long as you have that respect. This old master said it well, hoping to have a daughter like you. A daughter, even when she's a hundred years old, belongs to someone else. What do you need a daughter for?" (14)</p>
<p>Wandering in Art</p>
<h3>Little Sister Returns to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Houjue</p>
<p>When Chinese movies and dance were still in their infancy, Little Sister Li Minghui had already shown her talent. After a long separation, she has now returned to the silver screen. Her hometown is among the rivers and lakes of Hunan. Her father, Li Jinhui, is a famous musician. She was influenced by her father from a young age, and she has a deep foundation in music and dance. The China Song and Dance Troupe that her father ran was her pride. At that time, her most skilled song and dance dramas, such as "Sparrow and Child," "Grape Fairy," "Moonlit Night," and "Poor Qiuxiang," all contained educational significance. Many schools adopted them as teaching materials, unlike the current song and dance troupes that are full of fragrant and romantic靡靡之音. She first entered the entertainment industry at the Shenzhou Company. She showed her face in "Auspicious Flowers and Full Moon" and "Unbearable Memories." At that time, she was only ten years old and was a real little sister. Later, she entered the Great China Lily Company and starred in "Little Factory Owner" and "Visiting Relatives," etc. Her lively posture and deep expressions struck the inner layers of the audience's hearts. People also admitted that she was one of the most promising movie actors because she had a soul and artistic talent. But suddenly, she left the silver screen and roamed everywhere. Her footprints reached the stars and Singapore in the south, Rome and Java, etc., and the three northeastern provinces of Guanwai in the north. This also increased her experience and knowledge. Later, she went to Hong Kong, where, unfortunately, a huge wave arose in the sea of love, which shocked China and foreign countries. So this little sister, who was gradually forgotten by people, was once again spread to the mouths of people across the country. She quietly returned to Shanghai, keeping a low profile and not wanting to be noticed, but people were not willing to let her go easily, especially the bosses of the film companies, who encouraged her to return to the screen. She was also willing to have something to do, so she signed a contract with Tianyi Company. Her first film is called "Pursuit," which depicts the love disputes of young men and women. In the play, she plays the daughter of a bank manager. Her charming and lively demeanor is still no less than the charm of her earlier days as a little sister. Although she is a senior in the film industry, this is still her debut in a talking picture. It is said that "Pursuit" will be released soon, and we are ready to admire the style of the little sister we haven't seen in years on the screen.</p>
<h3>Stage Decoration</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>The contrast between red and green colors in stage decoration is vulgar to me. In the West, it is regarded as barbaric. The contrast between red, green, blue, and orange is the favorite of barbarians. Westerners use it for advertising to attract general attention. Using tiger skins as door curtains, tiger claws as foot ornaments, and the tops of white cranes and the heads of mountain dragons are also the animal hobbies of uncivilized nations. They are not suitable for modern decoration. Modern stage decoration is made of pure geometric shapes and painted with pure colors. The use of geometric shapes and lines is also extremely simple and accurate. Or even simple straight lines can form the overall pattern of the courtyard. The simpler the shape, the purer the color, such as the color of the object. There are only different light and dark divisions in each crystal, and there is no mixing of mixed colors. Therefore, if rose purple is used as the color, the entire courtyard is like a large purple stone presenting different facets of light. If emerald green is used as the color, the entire courtyard is matched with green, like the luster and substance of pearls, which is extremely true and pure. This can be seen in Shanghai's movie theaters. The modern stage decoration in France is even simpler, giving people an infinite sense of freshness. It is collectively called geometric color decoration. The stage is a comprehensive place of art, which has the beauty of space and time. Its decoration and its backdrop are especially important. However, the most unsatisfactory thing in Shanghai's social art is stage decoration and background. The confusing colors of Chinese and Western styles make people sit uneasily. The red Chinese pillars are matched with Western acanthus-style capitals, and the harmonious back screen is matched with a Western landscape background. It is neither a donkey nor a horse, which is especially bad. It is not as good as the past, where a clear song on the red felt was more memorable.</p>

<h3>The Main Reason for the Stagnant Flour Market</h3>
<p>Slow Sales · Large Factories Dump Stock</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, showed a slight steady trend in all months. Due to the price of Kansas wheat rising by about forty-five cents, the opening prices for each month seemed promising, rising by about five li compared to the previous day. Later, trading was unusually sluggish due to a lack of customer support. Inland merchants from various regions also completely halted operations due to tight credit. Therefore, the market never improved. By the afternoon opening, large factories continued to dump stock, and the market declined. This month was still stable, but later, as large factories also gradually unloaded their holdings, the market fell further. Currently, the inventory levels of each factory are high. If customer purchases this month are not active, prices may fall again. As a result, this month's price fell by 7.5 li compared to the previous day, April fell by 1.5 fen, June and July fell by 2.5 li, and August fell by 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Initial Stability Followed by Weakness in the Wheat Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s futures wheat market showed initial stability followed by weakness in all months after the opening bell in the morning and afternoon. With the price of Kansas wheat rising by forty-five cents, industry insiders all wanted to tighten their positions. Although trading was light, opening prices were slightly better, rising by one fen this month with minimal fluctuations in other months. By the afternoon opening, due to the stagnant flour market, market sentiment was flat. This month slightly declined by one fen. April, May, and June were not traded. July generally hovered, with active trading. August declined by two fen due to hedging.</p>
<h3>Quiet Cake Market, Red Grain Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Recently, the cake market has been sluggish. Factory prices have not been announced for several days. The few movements in the inland market are all from merchants redistributing stock to customers. Export merchants rarely inquire due to weak actual sales. Market sentiment is inevitably trending downwards, but factories are holding firm, so there are unlikely to be significant price drops in the short term. Demand for red grain is strong, and high-quality grains have risen by another three to four fen. Yesterday, four transactions were made, with Jiangbei merchants procuring the goods. The arrival of goods is still limited, but prices for high-quality grains are firm and the market outlook is good.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Trend Downward Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with the bond price turning down and the Dutch exchange rate trending higher, the trend turned downward again. The association set a base price for No. 24 raw white sugar, ordinary grade, at 14 taels and 9.5 mace, but there were no transactions. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 14 taels and 4 mace, and No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 11 taels and 6 mace, but there were also few buyers. A Guangdong and Hunan merchant offered 100 bags of Hainan red sugar at 9 taels and 8 mace, and a Zhubing merchant offered 100 outer bags at 8 taels and 2 mace, a slight decrease of two to three mace compared to the previous price. Chaoqing and Diaogong were also not traded. The base price of Jianbing also appeared stagnant, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>More Than Seven Hundred Boxes of Zhabei Preserved Longans Offered</h3>
<p>Recently, over nine hundred boxes of preserved longans from Dongxing, Shanghai, have arrived. Yesterday, it was reported that firms such as Daleihua have offered them for sale, with a total of over seven hundred boxes being sold. Top-quality, large-sized goods were priced at around 32 taels, with slightly lower prices for the next tier, ranging from 27-28 taels to 16-17 taels. Small sizes ranged from 12-14 taels, varying depending on the origin, which was much hotter and more volatile than the previous sale.</p>

<h3>Quiet Tea Market for Foreign Tea Firms</h3>
<p>The local tea market for foreign tea firms has been unusually sluggish due to the impact of the foreign financial turmoil. Yesterday, only British firm Jardine Matheson purchased 19 boxes of "Yuanzhen" tea at 86 taels and 100 boxes of "Guizhuang Zhenmei" tea at 50 taels. In addition, local firm Huaqing purchased 41 boxes of "Luzhuang Gongxi." There were no other transactions. However, it is heard that Jardine Matheson, Baocheng, and other firms have sent out large remittances for glazed Zhenmei tea, with prices reduced by seven to eight taels. Whether the transactions will be successful will depend on next week's report from Africa.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Sales Clear, Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local artificial silk market saw quiet sales due to unstable exchange rates. Only the Yangtze Bank purchased spot and futures contracts for 25 boxes of "Jin Jing Yi" silk from England and other countries. Prices remain firm.</p>
<h3>Figured Dousha Gabardine Is Popular</h3>
<p>Figured gabardine sales have remained brisk recently. Despite the frequent arrival of new goods, prices have risen instead. Yesterday, Dekee, Ningfeng, and Yongfeng brands were sold at a reduced price of 1 tael and 2 mace and 7.5 candareens per box. Plain gabardine with a stamp could still be sold at 2 taels and 8 mace net. Because this type of Dousha-colored gabardine did not sell well last year and there was a lot of inventory, no new goods have arrived this year. Currently, this type of Dousha color is popular, so the trend is brisk.</p>
<h3>Edible Daylily: Suitable for Both Vegetarian and Meat Dishes</h3>
<p>Edible daylily is the flower of an herbaceous plant, also known as yellow flower vegetable. It is named daylily because its flowers are needle-shaped and golden in color. It is produced in Shandong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Tianjin, and other places. This item is a side dish, and people in Fujian and Guangdong particularly love it and have a very broad palate. When new flowers emerge after the summer solstice, they are generally softer and do not last long. After the White Dew period, they can be fully dried, so the market price fluctuates significantly during these two periods. Before the Cold Dew Festival, it is important to pay attention to re-drying them to prevent mildew. The various grades of goods are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Top Grade: Yellow and bright in color, plump, dry, with few stems.</p>
<p>(2) Zhou Grade: Yellow in color, plump and long, dry, without stems.</p>
<p>(3) Daxing Grade: Yellow in color, even, with few stems, dry.</p>
<p>(4) Yanghua Grade: Yellow in color, thin, with stems, slightly soft.</p>
<p>(5) Xiangzhuang Grade: Yellow in color, uneven thickness, many stems, dry.</p>
<p>(6) Zhongxing Grade: Yellow in color, black stripes, thin, many stems, dry.</p>
<p>(7) Changshan Grade: Yellow in color, short and thin, dry, without stems.</p>
<p>(8) Xuzhou Grade: Similar to Dangshan Grade.</p>
<p>(9) Tianjin Grade: Varies in quality.</p>
<p>(10) Sichuan Grade: Yellow in color, plump, without stems, dry (may have black stripes when water is extracted).</p>
<p>In summary, the top grade is yellow, plump, dry, and without stems. Lower grades are yellow and withered or have black stripes, thin and short, soft, and with many stems. The quality can be distinguished within this range.</p>
<p>Regarding side dishes, they can be used in dishes such as edible daylily with pork, stir-fried edible daylily with shredded pork, braised edible daylily with chicken, duck eggs with edible daylily in soup, stir-fried edible daylily with shredded chicken, braised edible daylily with tofu, stir-fried edible daylily with dried tofu, and other dishes.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On "Saving the Nation"</h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>Historical facts later showed that it is only during times of so-called "national crisis" that the "nation" and the "people" are truly related. Of course, there is also "relation" in peacetime, but this relation is only one of being "governed" and of "paying taxes." In reality, the "nation" is not called the "people," but a portion of them.</p>
<p>"Our nation is in trouble," "Our race is in danger." Once "national crisis" looms, a portion of people loudly proclaim this. Needless to say, this cry calls on the "people" to "jointly face the national crisis" and "jointly rise to save the nation."</p>
<p>However, if you truly believe that you can freely "jointly face" the "national crisis" and truly freely "save" it, then you are not only a little foolish, you are simply "committing a crime." Because the "people's" "saving the nation" has, from ancient times, been limited to "those with strength contributing strength" and "those with wealth contributing wealth." As for the "others," those whose "fate is sealed," others will take care of them, so there is no need for you to ask, nor are you allowed to ask. That is why Bu Shi of the Han Dynasty was honored as a "model citizen."</p>
<p>The historical drama continues to be re-enacted to this day. Now, we are once again facing a "national crisis." Clearly, there are those who are loudly proclaiming... "Citizens arise and jointly face the national crisis!" However, "armed resistance against Japan" is "not allowed," and even advocating armed resistance against Japan is "not allowed." What is "allowed"? It is scientific saving of the nation, it is aviation saving of the nation, it is entertainment, dancing, and even beauty saving of the nation. In summary, it is still nothing more than "those with strength contributing strength and those with wealth contributing wealth." Moreover, you don't need to ask about the subsequent fate of the strength and wealth contributed to the nation. Let's just talk about aviation saving of the nation. Naturally, in this era of "no national defense without an air force," no one would deny the importance of "aviation." However, the iron hooves of imperialists have already shattered half of our country, and "the disaster of national demise is imminent." We are still leisurely promoting aviation saving of the nation, raising funds for "Children's Aircraft" and "Ningbo Aircraft"... even if this is a smokescreen, can distant water quench a nearby fire?</p>
<p>Moreover, what will the so-called "Children's Aircraft" and "Ningbo Aircraft"... be used for after they are raised? This also seems to be a question that cannot be avoided. What will they be used for? During the September 18th Incident, Young Marshal Zhang's three hundred aircraft were given to the Japanese. During the Guangdong Second Chen struggle, airplanes of some warlords were bombed and sunk, and there were also dispersals of pamphlets, and there was bandit suppression. Their use seems to be limited to this. Although newspapers have reported "XX aircraft flew to the X direction" in recent days, they ultimately disappeared after flying, and who can say that they were not fleeing for safety? Therefore, speaking from the bottom of my heart, "aviation" and our country's "national defense" have never had any real connection. If aviation can truly save the nation, we demand that all existing aircraft be flown to the battlefield to resist Japan. If national crisis can truly be jointly faced, we demand that all citizens automatically arm themselves to resist Japan. Otherwise, everything is nonsense, the old trick is still the same.</p>
<h3>Fall</h3>
<p>— Zhu Sha</p>
<p>The long arm of the Jianghai Customs clock pierced the deep black sky. The tide in the river crashed. The Empress steamship, strained her throat and, with a breathy moan, spit out mouthfuls of white foam, as though tired of the city and, slid away. A six-cylinder Citroen sedan sped along Avenue Edward VII at 37 miles per hour, hurtling towards the Bund, stopping in front of a building that had the name "Exchange" on it. Three men in their forties jumped out of the car. A sea of white morning mist hung over the river. A light breeze crept in under the arm of the stone statue. The three men shrunk their necks and scurried into the big building.</p>
<p>The clock in the big building also stretched its arm to tell us… 7:25.</p>
<p>"Look, it's not that early. Aren't Tingchang and Zhaofeng already here? Hey, Lao Yi, look at the short guy over there, he bought over forty lots of long positions yesterday."</p>
<p>The man called Lao Yi said, "If it wasn't for Lao Geng looking after you, you'd still be having fun with Lao Jiu. It's not early." Just as he was about to laugh, suddenly the short guy came over to greet them.</p>
<p>"Lao Yi, good morning. Judging by the way things are going, the market's going to change, isn't it? ... Didn't Tang Yulin withdraw from Chengde?"</p>
<p>At the mention of the market, the four heads immediately huddled together and spoke in low voices.</p>
<p>"The long positions that you old guys bought will prevail," said the man with the surname Geng.</p>
<p>Everyone in the exchange said so; with gold at this point, which buyer would be willing to get out? Even if the downward trend is so fierce, who doesn't hope it will bounce back? It won't drop below the 700 taels mark, and bouncing back would certainly be beneficial.</p>
<p>Time sped around the exchange, circling each person's heart, and men with different expressions walked in through the big doors in succession. Time also crawled on their hearts.</p>
<p>"It's nine o'clock, and the market hasn't opened yet." The short guy, who had been left behind in the crowd of others, came over again at this time. "The Bank of America is in turmoil? The new president is taking office? It's nine o'clock and the market hasn't opened yet!" Everyone in the exchange said so.</p>
<p>The exchange's temporary notice read: "The market will open as usual after the HSBC quote is announced."</p>
<p>9:40... the opening price was 698 taels. Lao Yi and the other three men and that short guy stared unblinkingly at the word "taels." The Michigan Bank, like a row of Sassoon House-like buildings, swayed in their minds, as if about to collapse. ... All eight eyeballs turned red.</p>
<p>"It really crashed through the 700 taels mark? The United States has banned gold exports, so where did this strange downward trend come from?" The short guy muttered like this.</p>
<p>"HSBC won't post its exchange rate; so how can there be a standard?" Everyone on the long side said so. The short guy jumped in front of Broker No. 27 and asked that question. Zhaofeng, who had bought 10,000 long positions, requested that his seal be sent to the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Time crawled on everyone's heart; the market stopped trading.</p>
<p>"Lao Geng, liquidate our 500 lots. Let them go. It's fallen 50 taels."</p>
<p>Retail long positions were all being liquidated! Let them go! The market fell to 60 taels.</p>
<p>"Let's liquidate what we bought! It's fallen 88! Lao Yi, if anyone wants to buy short, let them get out!"</p>
<p>"Let them get out!" Everyone on the long side said that. Their eyeballs all turned red.</p>
<p>The short side took the opportunity to push in again. Lao Yi and the other three men liquidated their 500 lots. "Let's take advantage of the situation and buy a little. Let's cut our losses!" he said, seemingly nonchalantly.</p>
<p>The car drove over from the middle of the road, carrying a full back of sunshine, and the three men squeezed into it. With a burst of speed, it disappeared into the white morning mist.</p>
<p>The clock in front of the Great World had reached 11 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Mad Dog</h3>
<p>— Qian Gecuan</p>
<p>Recently, I discovered some articles that seem to be scolding us in a small newspaper. Investigating the motive, it is nothing more than a despicable act of revenge. Because these few days, we unintentionally exposed the trickery of the word thief Zhang in the "Free Talk" section, pointing out his self-proclaimed masterpiece was stolen goods. In fact, when a thief has been caught, he should swear to heaven, repent of his wrongdoings, and kowtow for forgiveness. Why must he "act like Little Fu the Third in the alley, who, when he hears that his gang is in trouble, rolls up his sleeves and gets ready to fight," barking wildly and indiscriminately?</p>
<p>For this kind of shameless barking of a little scoundrel, there is no need to reply. However, I feel that they have already grown into human form, but are completely devoid of humanity and unable to distinguish right from wrong. They are truly pitiful. From a humanitarian perspective, we cannot help but point them out a little.</p>
<p>First, what you should learn... is that when writing an article, whether it is praise or criticism, the attitude should always be open and aboveboard. You cannot still squat behind the fence and bark wildly. When the barking is unreasonable, the "freedom" stick will hit you on the head. Moreover, if you only fart under the "thunder" and urinate under the "rain," no one will hear you and no one will see you.</p>
<p>Second, what you should learn... is that you must never echo what you don't understand. Because when you echo, not only will your actions be self-defeating, but you will also make more jokes and add to the ugliness. Honest words are offensive to the ear; you may want to quibble about this again. However, the facts have already been presented before the eyes of ten thousand people, and it is too late to correct them.</p>
<p>The sales volume of that small newspaper is not high. When I say "ten thousand people" here, I may be exaggerating. For those who have not seen those small newspapers, let me explain clearly.</p>
<p>Someone with the pseudonym "Spring Thunder" said in some comments… "He (referring to Qian Gecuan) previously wrote a long article introducing Jack London in the "Youth World" of Beixin, which was entirely copied from the Commercial Press's blue-covered book "The Life of Jack London." He even copied the death date of 1920 and made it 1916." In the above few sentences, he made two big jokes. I don't know if "Spring Thunder" heard wrong under the grave, or if his teacher said it wrong. Checking the third issue of the first volume of "Youth World," the article introducing Jack London was originally written by Mr. Sun Xizhen, and had nothing to do with Qian Gecuan. Mr. Sun's article said that Jack London was born in 1876 and died in 1916, which was originally correct. Although the Shanghai little scoundrel's abilities are great, I am afraid that he cannot reverse the fate of heaven. If Jack London is the "Second Elder" mentioned in the above article, we can still be amazed that he has gained a lot from reading and can firmly remember the words "Give me a few more years" in the book. Unfortunately, this foreign boss has never said such a sentence. Let's look at the ugliness shown by the person "Boyu." He said that Zhang's "Waves Washing Sand" is harmonizing with Nalan Xingde's poem. In ancient times, when people wrote poems, they did indeed harmonize. What is called "harmonizing"? The teacher in the agricultural department will certainly not teach you this. Now I will teach you. Harmonizing should only harmonize the last word of each rhyme. You cannot harmonize the whole sentence or half a sentence. Moreover, harmonizing must harmonize with the original rhyme, that is, the original word. If someone says "autumn" and you harmonize it into the word "sorrow," it is wrong. If Fan Chengda's original song is "Leaning and sitting in the east wind, a hundred charms arise," and Chen Sanpin harmonizes it into "The power of alcohol first rises from the blushing face," it is not considered harmonizing.</p>
<p>Finally, I must also give a few words of guidance to Li Wenyuan to be fair and unbiased. He said that Qian Gecuan should not have referred to Chinese and foreign books to introduce world literature in the first issue of "New China." This is even more of a joke. Because when writing an introductory article, it is precisely necessary to refer to Chinese and foreign books. Because that is an introduction to the facts, it must be based on something and cannot be a fabrication. If that kind of article can also be creative, then you might as well learn the method of "Spring Thunder," who completely changed the birth and death years of others.</p>
<h3>The Black Woman's Quest for God (30)</h3>
<p>— Written by Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>But, after they had taught him order and elegance, they even got used to him, and even to his terrible humours. One day, the old gentleman said to her, "A beautiful young woman like you can't be without a husband and children. I'm too old for you; you'd better marry that Irishman."</p>
<p>Because she had dedicated herself to the old gentleman with such devotion, she was furious when she first heard him tell her that she should marry someone else, and even spent the whole night pondering how to chase the Irishman away with her knobkerrie. To her way of thinking, the old man had been born sixty years too early, and according to the natural course of events, he was bound to die. And, in her mind, she had never admitted that he should remain a companionless man. However, the old gentleman printed these plain facts deeply into her mind, and eventually she gave in! The two of them walked into the vegetable garden together, and spoke to the Irishman. She was going to marry him. He cried out in alarm, picked up his spade, and rushed for the gate. But the black girl was on her guard, and had already locked the gate; before he could climb over it, they had caught up with him and were holding him tightly.</p>
<p>"Am I to marry a black heathen woman?" he wailed miserably, forgetting all the linguistic refinements he had lately acquired. "Let me go, can't you? I don't want to marry anyone."</p>
<p>But the black girl held him in an iron grip (although there was some softness in it); the old gentleman made it clear to him, once more, that if he ran away, he would only fall into the hands of some strange woman, who did not care about seeking God, and whose skin was not the glossy black satin he was so familiar with, but a gray-white kind. After half an hour's debate and urging, plus a goblet of the old gentleman's finest white brandy, at last he said "Oh, oh, then there's nothing more I can say." So they were married; and the black woman managed her Irishman and her children (who were of a delectable coffee-colour) very ably, and by degrees began to grow fond of them. In the concerns of them, and of the garden, and in mending her husband's clothes (which clothes it was useless to ask him to leave off wearing), she was so busy that, for the greater part of her time, this matter of seeking God was quite forgotten in her mind. But there were times, especially when she had just washed her beloved little soft quiet son, and was drying him with a towel, that her heart would recall its quest; only then she felt how interesting it had been! A woman, troubled in her life, is taught by the parsons to look upon God as a kind of fellow who keeps an eye upon everything that is done, and is solely concerned about her salvation; she is so self-important that she looks on herself as the centre of the universe, and actually sets forth to visit God. She would even tease her small son, and ask him "What should I do, if I saw God in my own house, and he hinted that I had been here too long, and he was becoming impatient?" This was a question that the small son could not answer in the least -- he only laughed hysterically, and caught hold of her wrist. When the small sons had grown up, and no longer depended upon her; when the Irishman had become so much a part of her that he was almost her own flesh; then, as they no longer took her away from herself, she had anew a leisure and a solitude that brought her sharply back to this question. But by that time, her deepened heart had carried her far beyond the stage when it was amusing to break idols with a knobkerrie. (The end)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Withdrawing from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The Privy Council and Political Circles Believe That</p>
<p>The Japanese Government's Diplomacy Has Failed</p>
<p>Review Meeting Advocates Censure of Foreign Minister Uchida</p>
<p>The Cabinet Will Also List Various Points to Refute Criticisms</p>
<p>Tokyo – A portion of the Privy Council and political circles believe that the current Cabinet's diplomacy regarding the League of Nations has been flawed, leading to a withdrawal that cannot be said to be anything but a failure. Therefore, there is considerable criticism, with some even advocating for holding Foreign Minister Uchida responsible.</p>
<p>The government will present the following points to refute these criticisms. At the Privy Council's plenary meeting on the 22nd, it naturally expects a full house to pass the consultation on withdrawal. 1. Japan's formal recognition of the independence of Manchukuo and the signing of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol are the very causes of withdrawing from the League of Nations. Since the League of Nations has consistently adhered to Eurocentric politics, Japan's withdrawal is natural. Especially with the decision to apply Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, it has no choice but to withdraw. In other words, having adopted a recommendation that includes non-recognition of Manchukuo, it is necessary to sever ties with the League of Nations in order to uphold the spirit of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. 2. Although Japan is withdrawing from the League of Nations, its policy of cooperating with other countries will not change. In the future, Japanese diplomacy will not require the intermediary hand of the League of Nations; direct negotiations with various countries will be more satisfactory. Therefore, there will be no practical harm in terms of diplomacy. (17th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Questions and Answers Between the Privy Council and the Government</h3>
<p>Where Exactly is the Rehe Boundary?</p>
<p>What About the South Seas Mandated Territories?</p>
<p>Countermeasures for the Sino-Japanese Problem Have Not Been Decided</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Privy Council's first review committee regarding the consultation on withdrawing from the League of Nations held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Privy Council office, lasting for three hours. The meeting adjourned at five o'clock. The content of the questions and answers is generally as follows: At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Hiranuma rose and stated his hope that, given the delicate nature of the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations, attention should be paid to not leaking information to the outside before the consultation has been decided. Afterwards, the Privy Council members and the government began answering questions. (Question) What are the countermeasures for the Sino-Japanese problem after withdrawal? (Answer) We will temporarily observe the situation in China and gradually discuss countermeasures. (Question) Although we are withdrawing from the League of Nations, we firmly believe that the South Seas mandated territories will still be Japanese territory. What is the government's view? (Answer) The South Seas mandated territories were not mandated by the League of Nations; rather, they were ceded by Germany to the five major powers as a result of the war. This is clearly stated in the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, even though we are withdrawing from the League of Nations, Japan's right to govern will continue indefinitely. (Question) According to the Lytton Report, Rehe is not included in Manchukuo. Where, then, exactly is the Rehe boundary? (Answer) The boundary is the Great Wall. (Question) If the anti-Japanese army adopts an offensive stance, will Manchukuo cross the Great Wall to annihilate them? (Answer) We currently have no intention of doing so. We must see how the situation develops. It is also possible that we will punish China in the end. (Question) What will be the diplomatic policy after withdrawing from the League of Nations? (Answer) We aim to establish a comprehensive plan. (17th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Military Figure Discusses Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Japan Occupies Manchuria, Not Fearing Blockade</p>
<p>Militarists Always Collude With Each Other</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Havas) – German General von Frangenberg published an article in the National Socialist Party's organ, the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung," discussing the Sino-Japanese issue, stating briefly, "Analysts often say that Japan should be sanctioned with a blockade. In theory, this is indeed appropriate, but in reality, Manchuria is a land rich in raw materials. Once Japan occupies Manchuria, it will not fear a blockade for a single day. No naval power can subdue Japan with this tactic." General von Frangenberg also stated, "From the standpoint of humanity and fairness, we cannot help but sympathize with China. However, we also cannot deny the shrewdness of Japanese politics and the firmness of its attitude. The development of the Manchurian issue sufficiently proves that the rise or fall of a nation depends primarily on the firmness of its people's self-defense psychology, and it is even more evident that policy should be based on the needs and interests of the nation."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Discuss the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>Nanjing – The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement is nearing its expiration date. Merchants and civilians across the country are presenting their views that the agreement, nominally reciprocal, in reality only benefits Japan and is tantamount to a disguised unequal treaty. For several years, the government and merchants have suffered greatly, and Japan is actively invading us. What reciprocity is there to speak of? People are presenting petitions to the government, requesting that it declare the agreement invalid at the expiration date and refuse to renew it, in order to remove the constraints on our country's commerce and increase maritime tax revenue. For the sake of prudence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will convene meetings with the Ministries of Finance and Industry to discuss solutions in the coming days. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Amidst Cheers</h3>
<p>MacDonald Announces Draft Disarmament Convention</p>
<p>Revision of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>Extension of the London Naval Treaty</p>
<p>France, America, and Germany Express Support</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Reuters) – British Prime Minister MacDonald unveiled the British disarmament proposal at the Disarmament Conference today amidst cheers from the audience. He began by stating the need to give nations peace and freedom, otherwise Europe would face destruction. He then called on armed nations to support disarmament and unarmed nations to support the establishment of trust, goodwill, and security.</p>
<p>MacDonald Briefly Outlines the British Government's Plan for a Disarmament Convention, Including the Number of Ground, Naval, and Air Forces, Limits on the Number of European Armies, Tanks, and Large and Small Mobile Heavy Artillery. At the same time, the Naval Disarmament Treaty should be universally applicable if possible, and aerial bombardment, with some exceptions, should be prohibited. Britain is prepared to agree to a complete ban on land and sea aircraft, but on the condition that civilian aircraft are not misused. Regarding chemical warfare, considerable agreement has been reached. This agreement should be incorporated into the treaty along with the provisions of the Permanent Disarmament Commission. This treaty should be valid for five years.</p>
<p>A Second Disarmament Conference Should Be Held Before the Expiration of the Five-Year Term to Continue Disarmament Work. The treaty should also stipulate that if a war occurs in violation of the Pact of Paris, signatory countries must hold a meeting upon request from one (or at least one major power) of the five signatory countries. Such a meeting may be convened by a League of Nations body, and the conclusion of this meeting must be supported by representatives of the major powers and a majority of other governments participating in the meeting. The attendees should strive to agree on how to deal with the breach and determine who is responsible.</p>
<p>The British Proposed Amendment to the Treaty of Versailles, Suggesting that Germany, in addition to overseas troops, should have an army of 200,000 men, double the maximum permitted by the treaty. France should have an army of 400,000 men, Italy 250,000 men, Poland 200,000 men, and Soviet Russia 500,000 men. The London Naval Treaty should also apply to France and Italy, in addition to Britain and the United States. Germany may be exempted from the naval provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, but Germany must maintain its current status and not change it before the end of 1936.</p>
<p>Each of the Six Countries – France, Italy, Russia, America, and Britain – May Have Up to 500 Combat Aircraft That Can Be Used in War. Airships should not be built anymore. Britain also proposed that the Permanent Disarmament Commission should draft a plan for the complete abolition of land and sea aircraft, and the abolition of warplanes should be conditional on effective supervision of civilian aircraft to prevent their misuse for military purposes. Chemical, incendiary, and bacteriological warfare should be completely prohibited.</p>
<p>After MacDonald Finished Speaking, Representatives from France, America, and Germany Spoke in Succession, Praising Him. French Prime Minister Daladier Rushed to Geneva and Listened to the Speech of the British Prime Minister, Praising MacDonald's Suggestions for Being Excellent and His Intentions for Being Universal. He Also Stated That France Was Determined to Support the Work of International Peace and Eagerly Hopes That the Meeting Between the British Prime Minister and the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome Will Be Successful. U.S. Representative Gibson Promised to Give Careful and Sympathetic Consideration to the British Plan, Saying That This Plan Could Serve as the Basis for a Lasting Convention. German Representative Nadolny Also Expressed Gratitude for the Measures Disclosed by the British Prime Minister, Saying That This Was the Only Plan That Could Allow the Disarmament Conference to Escape Its Difficulties.</p>

He Is Scheduled to Depart Tomorrow to Return to Geneva.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) – Today, Davis Was Officially Appointed as the Chief Representative of the U.S. Delegation to the Disarmament Conference, With the Same Rank as an Ambassador. According to State Department Officials, This Move Is Enough to Prove That the United States Is Doing Its Best to Fulfill Its Responsibilities to the Disarmament Conference. Davis Is a Member of the Democratic Party. In 1927, He Served as the U.S. Representative to the Geneva World Economic Conference, and in 1932, He Served as the U.S. Representative to the Disarmament Conference Again.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Havas) – French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour Will Depart for Paris Tomorrow Afternoon at 2 PM. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon Will Depart for Rome at the Same Time. Because British Authorities Came to France in Person, the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Plan to Visit London Soon to Return the Visit.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Havas) – The National Socialist Party's "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" Commented on British Prime Minister MacDonald's Trip to Rome, Saying That The Only Action That British Prime Minister This Trip Can Produce Is an Action Among the Countries That Guarantee the Locarno Treaty. The Newspaper Also Said That Italy Advocates for Postponing the Disarmament Conference, and Britain Advocates for a Temporary Solution to the Disarmament Issue. It Is Unknown Whether This Method Is Not a Compromise Solution That Is Harmful to Germany. (Note: The Present Telegram Refers To the Countries That Guarantee the Locarno Treaty, Namely Britain and Italy.)</p>
<h3>At a Time When War Has Openly Broken Out in the Far East, the European Situation Has Become Tense Again</h3>

<p>American Politicians Advocate Resolving Latent Political Problems</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (Reuters) – According to Opinions Expressed by Famous American Politicians Today, at a Time When War Has Openly Broken Out in the East, the European Situation Has Become Tense Again, With Germany and Its Neighbors as the Center. This Threatens World Peace No Less Than the War in the East. The United States Has Never Approved the World War Treaty. The Map of Europe Has Changed Because of This Treaty, and Its Borders Have Changed Even More Against the Wishes of the Local People. Therefore, There Have Always Been Several Places That Are the Source of Conflicts Between Groups and Countries. This Has Been Repeatedly Seen. In Addition to the Contentious Political Divisions, When Countries Are Separated by Lines on the Map, All Kinds of Panic Naturally Occur. The Intention of American Politicians Is That Before Solving the Arms Problem, These Latent Political Problems Must Be Thought About and Resolved. However, They Said That This Work Is Now Becoming More and More Difficult.</p>
<h3>British Naval Minister Announces Increase in Naval Expenditure</h3>
<p>Singapore Naval Base Making Satisfactory Progress</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) – Naval Minister Monsell Presented the Naval Budget in the House of Commons Tonight, Saying That This Year's Naval Expenditure Will Total 53,570,000 Pounds, An Increase of 3,930,700 Pounds Over 1932.

During the Debate, Someone Asked Whether Britain Had 50 Cruisers and Still Needed Battleships. Naval Minister Wallace Answered, "Yes, Britain Wants to Have Battleships Because If Battleships Are Abolished, They Must Be Replaced by Cruisers, Which Will Increase the Cost."

Wallace Also Spoke About the Singapore Naval Base, Saying That the British Government Ultimately Wants to Have a Properly Equipped Naval Base in Singapore. The Project Is Still Making Satisfactory Progress, But the Navy Department Can Only Focus on the Completion of Heavy Construction To Serve as the Backbone of the Naval Base Plan.

<p>Jinan – Luo Wengan and Jiang Zuobin returned to Nanjing from Jinan today. Luo said that he returned to Nanjing to sort out [censored] matters and cannot come north recently, nor can he go to Shanghai to welcome Wang. Someone hopes to negotiate directly, so one side is spreading rumors and the other side is using military pressure, but this is purely a rumor. I can be defeated, but I will never surrender. Jiang said that he cannot return to his post recently. Japan is also extremely complex internally. Young soldiers of the radical faction advocate aggression, while the stable intellectuals and capitalists believe that being enemies with the world is extremely dangerous, but because the radical faction is in power, they dare not speak. The economy is also in extreme panic. In short, they will not last. Luo also said that the League of Nations has passed the report and recently formed an advisory committee, which is absolutely sympathetic to us. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sales of Japanese Goods are Extremely Brisk</h3>
<p>Do Chinese Merchants Still Have Brains?</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 13th that if the Chinese government only holds out for three more months in its resistance in Rehe, the Chinese government will inevitably change its long-standing relationship with Japan, and the economic situation in China can escape its dire circumstances. Therefore, recently, the trade in Japanese goods has gradually shown signs of activity. For example: (1) Textiles: Although affected by the Rehe issue, the sales are more brisk than before the anti-Japanese movement. (2) Cotton cloth: In January, the amount imported from Japan to Shanghai was 2,755 cases, and in February, it was 3,055 cases. Although the Rehe Incident occurred, the import in February was more than in January. (3) Cotton thread: Sales in small quantities are the most numerous, and a more active trade is expected in the future. (4) Sundries: More active than other commodities, purchasing power has gradually recovered. (5) Sugar: Orders have been very strong in recent days. Last year, the import of refined sugar to Shanghai reached 48,080 piculs, and further progress is now expected. (6) Foreign paper: Since the anti-Japanese movement, it has been suppressed by Canadian and German products. Now that the anti-Japanese sentiment has weakened, there is also considerable import and export. (7) General industry: Recently, factories have expanded by as much as 30%. (8) Ships: About 3,000 tons of goods were re-equipped in Shanghai and sold to Hankou in mid-February, an increase of 500 tons compared with January. (9) Coal and industrial chemicals: Both have turned from pessimism and are gradually returning to their original state.</p>
<p>According to today's Japanese-language Shanghai Nippo, the Osaka Textile Federation has investigated the export of cotton cloth to China in mid-February, which has increased sharply to 13 million square yards, which is 35,288 square yards.</p>

In addition, Chong'an in northern Fujian was previously occupied and harassed by Fang Zhimin's gang, causing more than 10,000 refugees from the county to be displaced in Fuzhou, Ou, and Yanping, and they were unable to return home. Recently, the acting magistrate sent the provincial defense army [missing text] unit stationed in Jian'ou to cooperate with the [missing text] brigade of the [missing text] division stationed in Pucheng to suppress the bandits. The Qian and Zhang units started fighting with the bandits in Xingtian and Chishi in Chongxia on the 11th. The bandits were unable to support and retreated, and the government troops were chasing. The General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the border area of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian previously ordered the left-wing army to enter Zixi in eastern Jiangxi from Guangze in northern Fujian, and the central army to enter Shaowu in northern Fujian from Lichuan in eastern Jiangxi, to encircle and suppress each other. Now, due to a change in strategy, the left-wing army only ordered Zhou Zhiqin's brigade to guard Guangze and did not enter Jiangxi for the time being. The [missing text] unit of the central army then used all its strength to attack Guangchang from Nanfeng, to form an encircling force with Jianning, and temporarily postponed entering Fujian (March 13).</p>
<h3>Luo Lin's Division Pursues and Suppresses Kong's Bandits in Western Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Bandit Gangs Flee North and South to Harass</p>
<p>Their Momentum Has Been Reduced After Being Defeated</p>
<p>Nanchang News: Since the beginning of the month, the Kong bandits in western Jiangxi have emptied their nests and fled eastward to Shanggao, Xinyu, Fenyi, Fengxin, and Gao'an, causing a sense of panic for a time. After Luo Lin's division blocked and suppressed them in various ways, although they have not completely wiped out the remnants, the bandit's momentum has been reduced. The following is a record of the situation.</p>
<p>First, Peng Renren's Xiang army launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of the Kong bandits from Liuping towards the Jiangxi border. Xi's brigade of Luo Lin's division stationed in Gaocun and Tang's regiment stationed in Tonggu immediately advanced to cooperate in blocking and attacking. The bandits then fled through the path to Sanbaixing in Wanzai. On the 2nd, they suddenly fled east across the Rui River from Huangtian Ferry between Wan and Lu. Hu's battalion of Luo's army stationed in Lujiazhou detected this and rushed to intercept them. The bandits were halfway across the river, and hundreds were killed, and even more drowned. Thirty or forty rifles were seized. It was already dusk, and Hu's battalion immediately joined forces with Jiang's battalion stationed in Fangtang and Xue's battalion in Xujia Ferry of the division to suppress them southward. However, the bandits were extremely elusive, and unexpectedly attacked and captured Shanggao on the 3rd at dawn. Chen Youpeng, the head of Luo's regiment, immediately led the Hu, Jiang, and Xue battalions to fold back from Jietang and rush forward, and recovered Shanggao on the afternoon of the 3rd. The bandits then collapsed and fled north and south.</p>
<p>Those who fled north were the pseudo-18th Army, with about 2,000 people and about 700-800 rifles. On the 4th, they fled through the Xinxu Village area (the junction of Gao'an and Shanggao). Chen's regiment chased to Tangpu. On the 5th, the bandits fled north to Nanshan, and were caught up by Chen's regiment. Just as Yi, the deputy commander of the division, led the directly affiliated troops and rushed to flank them, they fought for half a day. The bandits could not support and collapsed northeast again. On the 6th, the bandits were chased by Chen's regiment to Fengxin, and were also blocked by the Yue division's engineering and transportation battalions. The casualties and captives reached 200-300. They fled west on the 7th. Chen's regiment arrived on the south bank of Luocun, and the bandits stubbornly resisted across the river. After wading across and attacking directly, they were greatly defeated at Leigong Cliff and Tianzi Mountain. The bandits abandoned all their supplies, and more than 100 people were killed, many rifles were seized, and seventy to eighty hostages were rescued. The bandits then fled to Jiuxiantang and encountered a team blockade and changed their route and fled west in a panic. Currently, the bandits have lost more than half of their troops. Luo Lin still ordered Hu's brigade to block them from Tanshan and other places, and Chen's regiment is still in pursuit. If the southwestern armies can advance deep into the blockade, it will not be difficult to completely eliminate them.</p>
<p>The northern and southern escapes of the Red bandits this time had a major reverse plan. According to the confessions of captured bandits, it was originally planned to send troops to attack the Luo Lin division headquarters in Gao'an. Seeing that those who fled north had been wandering between Xinxu Village (about 50 miles from Gao'an), and those who fled south had also been wandering between Shuibei and Yinggangling (about 60 miles from Gao'an), it seemed credible. However, because Chen's regiment pursued fiercely, the pseudo-18th Army that fled north suffered heavy losses and fled far away, so that the reverse plan could not be realized. After the 6th, the bandits who fled south approached Xinyu. Anfu Zhu, the division commander, also telegraphed that the pseudo-8th Army Li Tianzhu's troops, with more than 3,000 rifles, machine guns, mortars, and radios, suddenly fled from Yongxing through the western end of Anfu to Chigu, and planned to attack Xin and Fen. The Red bandits still had a reverse plan to jointly attack Xin and Fen. However, because the first step of the bandits' plan was not realized, and Xi's brigade quickly went south to pursue and suppress them, the pseudo-16th Army fled back in a panic, and the second step of their reverse plan was also destroyed. This was also fortunate.</p>

<h3>President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, Arrives in Shanghai at 3 PM</h3>
<p>Presidents of Various Central Yuan, Ministries and Commissions All Come to Welcome Him</p>
<p>President Wang Still Resides in His Private Residence on Avenue Petain</p>
<p>He Will Rest in Shanghai for a Few Days Before Proceeding to the Capital</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, returned to China on the French mail ship Aramis. The ship entered the port at 1 PM today, arrived at the Huangpu River at 2:30 PM, and landed at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf at 3 PM. He immediately took a car back to his private residence to rest. Presidents of various Central Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, as well as heads of various agencies in this city and representatives of various countries' envoys, gathered at the dock to welcome him, totaling several hundred people. Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, sent staff members to deliver a handwritten letter to Wang, requesting Wang to return to the capital immediately to preside over the central government's affairs. Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang Kai-shek, also specially sent Zhu Peide, director of the commission's office, to Shanghai this morning to represent the welcome. The various situations are recorded below. Wharf Security: The ship carrying Wang docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf in Hongkou. Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, made preparations for security and, to avoid crowding, stipulated that anyone entering the wharf to welcome him must first go to the bureau to collect a car entry permit before being allowed to enter the area by car. The concession authorities specially dispatched many capable detectives to the wharf for security. The Party-state flag was hung in front of the wharf, and a reception room for welcoming personnel was set up. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's military band also came to the scene to play music.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: Zhao Nai'guang, Shi Qingyang, Luo Gonghua, Peng Xuepei, Tang Youren, Wang Guangyuan, Liu Weichi, Huang Renlin, Dai Ji, Wen Hongen, and Wang's mother-in-law, Mrs. Chen, as well as relatives, etc., Wu Tiecheng, Gao Lingbai, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Shaokuan, Duan Ximing, Shi Ying, Zhu Peide, Bai Yunti, and Song Ziwen, Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Chu Minyi, Chen Shuren, and Tang Haian, etc., first took the Jinghui Wheel at the new customs wharf to Wusongkou and boarded the French mail ship together to enter the port.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's Talk: This morning, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, told reporters that Wang will still reside in his private residence on Avenue Petain after arriving in Shanghai today. Mr. Jiang's illness has been cured, but whether he will return to the capital to resume his duties will be decided after arriving in Shanghai. However, it is learned that Wang, out of love for the country and the people, and in the face of internal strife and foreign aggression, will take a brief rest and then return to the capital to resume his duties. As for the presidents of various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions, they will hold a meeting in Shanghai after Wang arrives in Shanghai. However, I have not heard of the saying of holding a meeting in Shanghai, and I know that there is no need to hold a meeting. However, after a long separation, a kind of reunion on friendship is naturally unavoidable, etc.</p>
<p>Lin Sen's Letter to Wang: Chairman of the National Government, Lin Zichao, was unable to come to Shanghai to welcome Wang in person due to the complexity of government affairs. In addition to sending Chu Minyi as a representative, he also brought a personal letter and handed it to Chu Minyi to be forwarded to Wang, requesting Jiang to return to the capital to hold the central government after arriving in Shanghai to help the times of difficulty.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel: Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, went to Hong Kong a few days ago to welcome Wang and will return to Shanghai with Wang today. In addition to Zeng, Wang's wife, Bi Jun, and daughter, Binbin, there are also German doctor Knoll, attendant doctor Luo Guanglin, secretary Li Haoju, etc., a total of seven people. It is rumored that Chen Dachu and Chen Jiuwen also returned to China with Wang, which is not true. The two Chens accompanied Wang abroad to study aviation, and are still studying abroad and will not return to China for the time being.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Will Come Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Zhesheng (17th) will arrive in Shanghai by the No. 3 flower car from Beijing at 11:30 AM, accompanied by Secretary Lu [missing text] at 8 AM tomorrow morning.

<h3>Fang Benren Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Tang Yulin's retreat without a fight was first impeached by the Control Yuan, and then various public organizations petitioned for strict handling. The Military Affairs Commission has designated Fang Benren to thoroughly investigate the truth together with representatives of the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Military Administration to verify the facts. It is learned that Mr. Fang arrived in Shanghai this morning, preparing his luggage, and will soon go north. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Fang at his residence and asked about the steps of the investigation. According to Mr. Fang, Tang Yulin's retreat without a fight was first impeached by the Control Yuan, and then various public organizations petitioned for strict handling. However, Tang Yulin issued a telegram after withdrawing from Chengde, stating the process of withdrawing from Chengde, and said that he would never surrender or rebel. The Rehe Provincial Party Department also sent a telegram to Beijing, reporting that Tang Yulin was the last person to withdraw from Chengde. Moreover, a liaison staff officer of the Military Affairs Commission, Peng, had met Tang Yulin outside the customs. Tang tried his best to explain that when the enemy army attacked Chengde, Tang had led a team to resist, but was defeated and retreated. Therefore, the Military Affairs Commission specially sent me to go north with representatives of the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Military Administration to thoroughly investigate the truth to verify the facts. The Control Yuan has now designated Shao Hongji as a representative, and the Ministry of Military Administration has telegraphed Minister He to send personnel nearby to participate. My coming to Shanghai this time is to handle private affairs and prepare luggage, and I will go to Beijing in two or three days to go north with Mr. Shao Hongji, and then work with representatives of the Ministry of Military Administration to start investigating the facts, so as to return to Beijing to report. As for what kind of punishment Tang Yulin will receive, this is the power of the government, and I cannot predict it in advance.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Will Go Abroad Within a Month</h3>
<p>Lingering in Shanghai is Not a Fact</p>
<p>Various Shipping Companies are Soliciting Business</p>
<p>This morning, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited a confidant of Zhang Xueliang. According to him, Zhang has decided to leave Shanghai with his family and travel to Europe and the United States in a short period of time to show his determination to hide his talents. The rumors of lingering are by no means a fact. Zhang hopes to go abroad as soon as possible to avoid this misunderstanding. Therefore, Zhang immediately left Ping by plane after issuing the telegram. After his wife, Yu Fengzhi, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, she immediately prepared to go abroad. However, because the countries he plans to travel to are more numerous, it is not easy to obtain a passport for a while, but it will be done within a month. Currently, major shipping companies have sent people to negotiate this ticket. It is expected to be decided in three to five days. In addition to Yu Fengzhi and six children, secretaries may also go with them. As for whether Zhang's younger brother, Xueming, will go with him, it has not yet been decided. He will probably stay abroad for one or two years.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Plans Joint Transportation on the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Shanghai Railways</h3>
<p>Both Lines Will Implement Complete Through Traffic</p>
<p>And Connect with Waterways Along the Route</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that the results of the reorganization of passenger and freight transport on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are gradually becoming apparent. Minister Gu Mengyu plans to gradually improve them in the hope that the two lines will become a model among railways. On the 16th, the Ministry of Railways ordered the two railway bureaus to quickly plan the unified traffic management methods for the two lines, as well as the joint water and land transport and road transport methods along the two lines, so as to implement them immediately. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Yu [missing text], the director of the business department of the ministry, and Tan Yaozong, the assistant, to inquire about the detailed methods. The following is a record of their conversation.</p>
<p>Organize Complete Through Traffic on the Two Lines: Yu and Tan said that the entire journey of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines is shorter than that of the Tianjin-Pukou line. Historically, passenger and freight transport on the two lines has been divided, and only joint through traffic has been opened. The Ministry of Railways believes that the two lines are connected, and if all items, whether special express trains, third- and fourth-class cars, or even freight cars, can be connected directly, the smooth flow of passenger and freight transport, the economy of time, and the saving of manpower and resources will be of great convenience to passengers, freight merchants, and the railway. For example, passengers and freight merchants who previously traveled from Jiaxing to Changzhou, in addition to the joint transport car, had to be delayed and go through procedures at the intersection station. Now, with one improvement, all stations between the starting and ending stations of the two lines can take the car at any time and get on and off at the address. The price of passenger and freight transport will remain the same and will never increase. Viewing the two lines as one line will eliminate the long-standing accumulation of time-consuming and uneconomical practices. The Ministry of Railways has now formulated principles and ordered the two railway bureaus to add opinions on this unified traffic management method and prepare immediately. It is expected that it will be realized at the latest in two or three months. At that time, the traffic affairs of the two lines will be equivalent to direct traffic on one line, and the travel time can also be quite economical.</p>
<p>Joint Transport on Waterways and Roads Along the Route: The responsible transport of the two lines has been realized, but for the convenience of various stations, the Ministry of Railways has also decided to organize responsible transport at important waterways along the two lines. For example, the freight transport of Zhejiang Ping [missing text] and the freight transport of Jiangsu Dongting Mountain must be transferred to the railway near the exchange station for transport. If joint water and land transport is organized, all procedures can be handled by the railway, saving both money and time. In addition, roads such as the Xiaoshao section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo road and the Cao'e River section road are also included in the cost and joint transport with the railway. The joint transport of the Jingwu road and the Beijing-Shanghai road has been discussed and can be realized. In this way, the vicinity of the two lines, regardless of whether they are close to the highway or only accessible to the waterway, can be transported by the railway on behalf of the shippers, and the circulation of goods will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Instructs the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Announce the Implementation of the Abolition of the Tael</h3>
<p>Accounting Books and Deeds Should All Be Changed to the Silver Standard</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance today instructed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce: In order to comply with the order, the Ministry previously issued a notice that all receipts and payments of public and private funds and all transactions should be changed to silver coins from the 10th of this month, and the silver tael should be abolished and changed to interest rates. It has been implemented for several days, and the situation on the market is quite convenient. The Ministry has now decided that the abolition of the tael must be implemented within the shortest possible time. The Chamber is hereby ordered to immediately inform all colleagues that from the date of receipt of the order, all accounting books, deeds, and new loans should all be changed to the silver coin standard and no longer use silver taels. This is a preliminary announcement, and you should all abide by it and report it.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Silver is Shipped to the United States</h3>
<p>Total Value of Approximately One Million Yuan</p>
<p>The United States is a country that exports silver bars. In the past, large quantities were shipped to our country. Recently, the import of American silver bars has gradually decreased. After the financial turmoil occurred in that country, a large batch of silver suddenly shipped to the United States in Shanghai. The General Grant of the American Dollar Bank reported that more than 20 boxes of silver ingots were shipped to San Francisco, USA, with a total value of more than one million yuan. Shipping silver from Shanghai to the United States is indeed an innovation.</p>
<h3>Organizations to Aid Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>Will Hold a Third Joint Meeting</p>
<p>Various organizations in this city to aid Northeast refugees held two joint meetings at the Local Association to discuss unified methods. This morning, news came from the Northeast Association that a third meeting will be convened within days to discuss various unresolved issues.</p>
<p>The China Relief Association Urgently Awaits</p>
<h3>Donations of Medicinal Supplies from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Medical Personnel Can Also Register to Participate</p>
<p>The Medical Team of the China Relief Association resolved to go north on the 28th to establish hospitals and treat injured soldiers and civilians. However, there are still many shortages of needed medicinal supplies. In addition to writing letters to various manufacturers to request donations, they urgently hope that all walks of life will provide material assistance. It is also heard that the association is very serious about medical personnel. Those who have medical experience and can endure hardship can also register to participate, but they must prepare surety bonds, letters of intent, and other procedures and send them to the General Affairs Office of the association at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Tibet Road for review. After passing the review, they will be notified by letter to arrange an interview.</p>
<h3>The US-Based Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company Will Send Aircraft to China for Demonstrations</h3>
<p>So That Chinese People Can Choose to Buy Them</p>
<p>Passports Arrived This Morning from Beijing</p>
<p>The US-based Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in this city, because various places in our country are forming aviation relief groups and raising funds to purchase aircraft due to anger at the invasion of the Japanese bandits, sent personnel to Beijing at the beginning of this month to promote sales, carrying the latest aircraft drawings to contact the Aviation Administration and request the Aviation Administration to apply for passports to facilitate telegraphing the head office to send aircraft to China for demonstrations in Beijing. This morning, the company has received the Aviation Administration passport forwarded by the US Consulate in Beijing and has forwarded it to the Washington head office, requesting it to select several of the most beautiful and solid military aircraft of different types to come to China for flight demonstrations so that Chinese people can choose to buy them.</p>
<h3>Philippine Merchants Preparing to Establish Dumping Agency</h3>
<p>Commercial Delegation to Visit Shanghai Next Month</p>
<p>The Philippine government, in light of the intense anti-Japanese goods movement in China, which has led to a sharp decline in the sales of Japanese goods in China, previously authorized commercial organizations to form a Far East commercial inspection delegation to investigate the current status of Japanese goods in China in order to promote Philippine goods. It is now preparing to establish a large-scale Philippine goods dumping agency in Shanghai. According to sources in the Philippine business community in this port, the inspection delegation has been organized and consists of 36 members, led by the head of the delegation, Peng Gensi. It is scheduled to depart for Shanghai around the 20th. It has also obtained passports issued by Zhang, the Consul-General of China stationed in Manila, Philippines. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month and will stay in Shanghai for five days. It will then be divided into two groups, one traveling along the Jinghu Railway to Nanjing and the other traveling along the Huhu Railway to Hangzhou. After half a month, they will gather in Shanghai again and go to inspect the Pingjin-Hankou area.</p>
<h3>Upstream Water Rises, Various Steamers Planning to Resume Hunan Route</h3>
<p>After the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River receded, the route from Hunan to Changsha was closed to commercial steamers due to the low water level. Only iron barges and small steamers were used to transport goods, making transportation in Hunan Province very difficult. At the time when a large amount of Hunan rice was being shipped out of the province, a large amount was stockpiled waiting to be loaded. On the 15th of this month, Changsha sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that the river water in Hunan had risen sharply, exceeding thirteen feet, and the waterway was open. The Hunan passenger associations requested that various steamer companies send ships to resume service. The Hunan Provincial Rice Production and Sales Committee also telegraphed various companies to send ships to transport the rice. Steamer companies in Shanghai are arranging for Yangtze River steamers to resume the Hunan route, and Hunan rice will soon be arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Lianxing Steamer Out of Danger, Sailing North</h3>
<p>Stranded in Sheshan for More Than Ten Hours</p>
<p>No Major Damage to the Bottom of the Ship</p>
<p>The Lianxing steamer of the Zhaoxing Company ran aground in the waters off Sheshan. According to news from the company this morning, the Lianxing was heading to Longkou from Shanghai, fully loaded with flour. After being stranded in Sheshan, it floated to the surface with the rising tide after more than ten hours. Afterwards, the shipowner and others inspected the bottom of the ship and found no major damage. It departed from Sheshan for Longkou in the afternoon yesterday.</p>
<h3>Small Kidnapping Case Solved</h3>
<p>Young Hostage Jiang Atang Returned</p>
<p>Three Male and One Female Kidnappers Awaiting Trial</p>
<p>Jiang Desheng of the Western District China Foreign Telephone Company, resides at No. 45, Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, French Concession. Because Jiang usually has some savings, he was targeted by bandits. Jiang has a son named Atang, who is only six years old. He disappeared while playing in the alley at 3:00 PM on the thirteenth day of the first month. They searched everywhere but could not find him, so they reported to the police station and requested an investigation. Soon, eight letters of demand came from the bandits, demanding 15,000 yuan. Only then did they realize that he had been kidnapped. They reported to the police station again, and Inspector Jin Jiulin, along with detectives Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detective Zhou Yaoting, Zhou Bingcheng, and Bao Tan, disguised themselves and went to Room 22 of the Fuxiang Hotel on Guangxi Road. They arrested Zhou Liansheng and Zhang Hualang, both from Shaoxing. They also arrested a fellow accomplice, Fei Jingzhao Jun, at No. 438 on the same road. He confessed that the hostage was hidden in the pavilion room at No. 30, Wufu Lane, Tokyo Road, West Shanghai. Therefore, at about 1:00 AM this morning, they joined Chinese and Western detectives from the Putuo Road police station and arrested the female guard on the spot, and took them all to the police station to be transferred to the court for trial. The hostage was notified to be taken back by his family.</p>
<h3>Fraudster Wang Jiasheng Plots to Frame a Friend after Committing Fraud</h3>
<p>Framing His Wife and His Friend, How Vicious</p>
<p>Fabricating Evidence, His Scheme Exhausted</p>
<p>Wang Jiasheng, a native of Guangdong, was sentenced to three months in prison by the First District Local Court last winter for committing fraud. He was imprisoned in the Zhenlanqiao prison. While in prison, Wang suddenly heard that his wife had remarried and that the lover was his close friend He Shengxiang. He was filled with resentment. When he was released from prison at the end of January, he immediately went home to question his wife. Unexpectedly, when he arrived home, he could not find his wife. When he asked the neighbors, they all said they did not know where she had gone. At this time, Wang Jiasheng had the feeling of "the phoenix has flown away, leaving the tower empty." He suspected that his friend He Shengxiang had committed adultery and harbored thoughts of revenge. Therefore, he wrote three threatening letters to Bo Lao Ke, a Westerner at the Electric Car Company, and Chinese employees Wang A and Zhang Shaoshan, intending to defraud them of 100,000 yuan. After receiving the letters, Bo and others reported to the police station and requested an investigation. Wang Jiasheng then went to the Laoza Police Station on January 21 to report that the extortionist was He Shengxiang and that he was hiding somewhere. He said that he could lead the police to arrest him and swore that if he was lying, he would accept the punishment. The police chief then sent detectives Huang Yingjie and Wang Yifei to arrest him. When they arrived in front of He's house, Wang Jiasheng bravely rushed in first, went straight into He's room, took out a threatening letter that he had written in advance, and secretly placed it in a drawer. Afterwards, the detectives arrested He and searched the room, finding another threatening letter. They took He back to the police station. After comparing the handwriting of each letter, it was confirmed that they were written by the same person, but He denied it and wrote several numbers, which were very different from the letters. The detectives then questioned Wang. Wang, in order to achieve his purpose of framing him, did not hesitate to lie, saying that although He denied it, there were witnesses who could prove that He had written the threatening letters. The witness lived in Mingde Lane on Huishan Road. If they needed a testimony, he would go to visit and check if they were home. However, after using this as an excuse to escape, he went straight to He's house and falsely offered his hospitality to He's mother, Chen, saying how he would rescue He Shengxiang, but that he urgently needed more than a hundred yuan to mediate so that the crime would be lighter in the future. The old woman loved her son so much that she did not have time to consider the good or bad, and gave all the cash of twenty-five yuan, and borrowed eighty yuan from relatives and friends to make up a hundred yuan. After Wang got the money, he returned to report to the detectives, saying that the witness was at home and could be questioned quickly. He still acted as the guide. When approaching Mingde Lane, he suddenly took the opportunity to escape. The detectives released He and then arrested Wang Jiasheng. Yesterday, Wang visited a friend, Yu, who was also a friend of He and knew the details of his plan to frame He. Therefore, he reported it to the police and arrested Wang. This morning, Fu Jirenming was sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Feng Shide presided over the trial. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the details of the case and requested that the defendant be severely punished according to law for three crimes: extortion, fraud, and false accusation. After Judge Feng finished the trial, he ordered the defendant to be detained and await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Unable to Endure Maltreatment by Sister-in-Law, She Committed Suicide by Drowning</h3>
<p>At about 6:30 this morning, a woman, about twenty-two or four years old, was found at the mouth of the river opposite the Yangshupu Lan Road Fire Station. She was lightly dressed and had just lost her sister-in-law. Unable to endure the maltreatment of her sister-in-law at home, she was extremely angry and committed suicide by drowning herself in the river. When she was spotted by someone, they immediately reported to the nearby police station and tried to pull her up. She was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment in a fire station ambulance. However, she had swallowed too much water and died. Later, the hospital sent the body to the Feilun Road autopsy center for examination.</p>

<h3>Small Talk</h3>
<h3>Sympathy</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>The word "sympathy" is inherently difficult to define, as I feel it is too vague. If you don't believe me, read the following:</p>
<p>For example, if a friend who is a thief steals because he is unbearably hungry, should we sympathize with him? Is this act of robbery worthy of our benevolent gentlemen's sympathy? It is difficult to say. Of course, he is hungry, and unbearably so. Oh, right, we have been hungry before, and it is indeed not a pleasant experience. Yes, we want to sympathize with him, and he deserves our sympathy, so we sympathize with him. But he is now robbing others, which is against the law, so you say he should be punished, and others say he should be punished even more. What about us? We also say he should be punished because how can we go against the will of the people? Thus, we transfer our sympathy for the hungry to the rice store owner. So, we sympathize with the rice store owner for raising his hand to beat this thieving friend we once sympathized with.</p>
<p>The poet says, "I am full of sympathy, and I sympathize most with my wife's suffering." But unfortunately, the poet is abandoned by his wife, and his wife has found a new love. So, our poet flies into a rage, throws his wife to the ground, and says through gritted teeth, "I truly cannot sympathize with your shameless behavior."</p>
<p>Scientists sympathize with the sluggishness of human life, so they strive to invent things to increase the joy of life. Furthermore, scientists sympathize with the poor masses who cannot live and cannot die, so they invent various killing machines to allow them to ascend to heaven in the flames of poison gas.</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army fights against imperialism in the slaughter of airplanes, artillery, and tanks. This is most worthy of our benevolent gentlemen's sympathy. So, what about the generals and marshals who invite the enemy into the country to preserve the nation's vitality? Sympathize with them, anyway, we have plenty of sympathy to spare.</p>
<p>It turns out that sympathy is such a difficult thing to understand.</p>
<h3>Welcoming XXX is a Prank</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>He invented the non-resistance policy, which not only ruined the resource-rich three northeastern provinces but also abandoned the mountainous Rehe province, allowing the enemy to take control of his ancestors' tombs. The general, who caused the people of four provinces to be trampled on by the puppet state, claimed to be burdened by the government's responsibilities and unable to face the people's trust. He has committed numerous transgressions and cannot offer any excuses. Yet, it is still shocking to hear that he resigned and came to Shanghai, still followed by a cloud of advisors, adjutants, secretaries, and guards. It is truly inexplicable that the important figures of this port still gathered and led the Public Security Bureau military band, funded by the state, to welcome him. Even if the central government is generous and considerate, and does not punish him with national law, can society have no sense of right and wrong and treat him as if he had returned in triumph after a victory? This not only undermines the country's prestige but also invites ridicule from foreigners. He claimed that after shouldering this heavy responsibility, he intends to cultivate his moral character, increase his knowledge, and become a good citizen, and that he deeply desires that people in society and his friends treat him as an ordinary person. Why did the important figures, in addition to welcoming him at the airport, still want to hold a banquet to wash away the dust? If XX can truly stimulate his conscience, what face will he have to face the people at the banquet in such a large gathering? It is not flattery but a prank. Some say that in addition to having already purchased a villa in Shanghai as a place for recuperation, he did not have time to arrange it because he came in a hurry. Therefore, he has already seen a tall foreign house with lush flowers and green grass. This place is so pleasant that he has forgotten about Shu. He has no time to think about the land of the three provinces, so he can happily enjoy the banquet and describe his hope that someone can inherit his mantle of non-resistance.</p>

<h3>Shop Clerk Communication</h3>
<h3>Saving the Nation Through Aviation</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhongyi, Wu Xinghai</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Thank you for publishing our letter in your March 4th issue and for your praise. We are extremely grateful. We should not "talk empty words" and always shout "Save the nation through aviation" or write a few trendy words in writing. Because these are mostly useless to the facts! Although our strength is very small, rivers are formed by drops of water, and fox fur is collected from small pieces. Therefore, we are now sending two silver dollars. We hope that you will forward them to the Aviation Association, and we hope that all apprentices in the country will rise up, save their monthly expenses and all their spare money, to build this apprentice-named plane to drive away the brutal Japanese devils. This is our twelve-point hope! This is specially sent to you, and please work hard.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyi, Wu Xinghai, together.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In the past few days, we have received many letters from young people. Because they have seen the Japanese becoming more and more unreasonable and the government has no way to deal with it, giving way with their hands tied, their patriotic hearts have been stirred up and they can no longer bear it. One by one, they have expressed their willingness to go to the front line to kill the enemy. This expression of theirs is of course out of patriotic enthusiasm. What else can the editor say to them besides admiration? However, fighting foreign enemies and dealing with national disasters is an extremely difficult task. It is necessary for the whole country to be united in mind and heart, and to move in a coordinated manner in order to achieve results. Indeed, the government should be far-sighted and have a plan in mind. The people should also be prepared to sacrifice everything to be the government's backing. However, in order to require that their actions be coordinated, our people should now focus on the word "preparation". It is absolutely impossible to be mobilized in a disorderly manner due to a momentary impulse, which would disrupt the government's plans. Now, on the one hand, the government has enough troops that can be mobilized, so it does not ask the people to go to the front line to kill the enemy. At the same time, on the other hand, the equipment of the air force is far behind that of the enemy, and it is necessary to urgently seek replenishment. Moreover, the country's financial resources are not enough to carry out this matter, so it is seeking assistance from the people in various places. Under these circumstances, the people who truly love the country should first dedicate our financial resources and work hard in this direction. We are not saying that we should not go to the front line to kill the enemy, but that it is not very necessary now. We should be prepared at all times, and when the government opens its mouth and says, "Now you people should go to the front line," all the people will be able to pack their bags and go, and not be clever people who shout to go to the front line when they know that the government does not allow you to go. When the government wants you to go, you will show reluctance.</p>
<p>The last time we received a letter from Zhang and Wu, their patriotic feelings were overflowing, but they did not shout to go to the front line. They sincerely followed the path advocated by the government and supported saving the nation through aviation. Now, their letter is a further step towards practical action. Judging from their attitude, the editor dares to boldly make a judgment: "Once the government really asks us to go to the front line, they will definitely run ahead of the people who are shouting to go to the front line now." Those who are no more intelligent than them may sing an even higher tune at that time, in order to avoid sacrifice. Therefore, we do not neglect Zhang and Wu's patriotic attitude because it is only a small amount of two dollars. We have respectfully forwarded these two silver dollars to the Aviation Association and sent the receipt to the two gentlemen. We know that the apprentices in the old-fashioned shops work hard for a month, and the price they get is probably not more than one dollar. Therefore, Zhang and Wu's two dollars are actually their entire month's income, even without deducting other expenses. If every citizen of China could contribute their one month's income to the country to buy airplanes, then China's air force could at least compare with Japan's. The day before yesterday, the editor went to a certain bureau in this city to visit a friend on an important matter, and unintentionally heard his colleagues sighing and discussing what "Really deserves to die, now our salaries are going to be discounted because of 'saving the nation through aviation'." Imagine a dignified civil servant, for the sake of the great cause of saving the country, is already complaining when his salary is only slightly discounted. From this point of view, Zhang and Wu's two dollars are really precious.</p>
<p>These days, according to people in the Aviation Association, since the loss of Rehe, the donations received by our association have been decreasing every day. At that time, I was very surprised. After thinking about it, I suddenly realized. It turns out that the people who understood saw that the government was so useless and became discouraged. They prepared to keep the money that would have been donated to the Aviation Association to slowly use after becoming slaves of a fallen nation! Alas! Writing to this point, the editor really cannot bear to write anymore, but I have to write. Think about those mixed things like Tang Yulin, who were originally unreliable. It was originally a ridiculous play for us to hope that he would defend Rehe to the death. Therefore, it can be said that Rehe was lost a long time ago, and it was not lost after Tang Yulin ran away. Therefore, the loss of Rehe should not really affect our patriotic hearts. Even if it does affect us, it should only increase our efforts, and there is absolutely no reason to be discouraged. Moreover, we are advocating saving the nation through aviation, knowing that our air force is not as good as the enemy, and there will be more defeats than victories in battle. Therefore, it is expected that we will suffer a few defeats before this plan succeeds.</p>
<p>Apprentices of the whole country! Compatriots of the whole country! Rise up and support this cause of saving the nation through aviation! This cannot be delayed, this is urgent. Your donating a few dollars to the Aviation Association is more needed than your going to the front line to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>As for the "Apprentice" plane proposed by Zhang and Wu, we believe that it can only be temporarily reserved. In the future, if the apprentices' donations are indeed substantial, it will be proposed again. Finally, we want to state that whatever we do, we must move in a coordinated manner. Therefore, please send future donations directly to the Aviation Association of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge in this city.</p>

<h3>Time in a Dream (Continued 5)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Although I have more than twenty dollars, there are still more than two months before the holiday, and after..." Wu Yi didn't dare to try rashly.</p>
<p>"This can't be delayed! Let's discuss the future slowly!" Wang Yulin has thoroughly researched the principle of "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," and he truly deserves to be a person who has lived in Shanghai for a long time. "If you want to buy it, I'll accompany you right away."</p>
<p>Wu Yi, who had been baptized in a university in Shanghai for more than two months, could no longer maintain the same firm composure as before.</p>
<p>After buying the Shanghai old suit from Datouba, the general distribution center for old clothes, Wang Yulin immediately forced Wu Yi to change into it... and taught him to vigorously clean up his pair of leather shoes.</p>
<p>"Today, Mei Lanfang and Wang Fengqing are singing The Fourth Son Visits His Mother, this play is not bad." Wang Yulin was lying on the bed with a newspaper in his hand, watching leisurely. "Wu! Have you never heard of Mei Lanfang? I'll invite you! I can guarantee you'll be satisfied."</p>
<p>"Wu Lanfang... Mei Lanfang..." Wu Yi was clearly quite tempted. "But, I haven't prepared for the education psychology and school administrative law classes tomorrow morning..."</p>
<p>"Li XX will definitely be absent tomorrow, psychology is not a problem," Wang Yulin predicted with certainty. "Not necessarily."</p>
<p>"Haha, you are really a fool. In Shanghai universities, if a professor doesn't skip class, he can't be considered a celebrity." Yuyulin, who had a very keen observation of everything, said something very truthful. "For example, if he has six hours of class every week, then he has to skip at least two classes, otherwise other professors and students will laugh at him. Li XX is the biggest fan of dancing, and he's absent from the first class on Monday eight times out of ten. Do you not even know this?"</p>
<p>"You're right!" Wu Yi also believed his words. "But, isn't there a test for administrative law tomorrow?" "This is even less of a problem! Eat some thorny goods, go to the school doctor to ask for sick leave, it's also an open secret in Shanghai universities. Are we afraid we can't learn it?"</p>
<p>"Haha... haha... haha..." In a burst of wild laughter, Wu Yi began to understand the true face of Shanghai universities.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Film Education Movements in Various Countries (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chen Wan</p>
<p>The National Juvenile Film Education Bureau aims to research and provide film education materials for children. They advocate that film education materials for elementary schools should be suitable for subjects such as self-cultivation, history, geography, and nature. Film education materials for children's social education should be suitable for adventures, hunting, shepherd and sailor life, Indian life, animal life, historical facts, myths, foreign customs, and so on. Moreover, the ending of each film must clearly show the destruction of evil and the victory of good. Materials involving cruelty, murder, madness, crime, gambling, sexual luxury, the hell after death, and rebellion are all rejected. In addition, educational charities in the United States are also enthusiastic about promoting film education, such as the Boston Educational Industrial Association, which subsidizes huge amounts of funds every year to promote film education. Women's clubs in various places also raise funds to show educational films every week to cultivate the physical and mental health of their children. Japan's film education movement is centered on the Social Education Bureau of the Ministry of Education. In addition to compiling educational films and promoting and approving excellent films, it also connects with the social education departments and disease prevention and health departments of various prefectural and county offices to show films on social education. However, the results are not very significant. Currently, the most active, most organized, and most successful of all film education movements in Japan is the All-Japan Film Education Research Association. This association was established in July 1927, based on the Daimei Film Library jointly established by the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun and the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, and the Tonichi Film Library. Since 1908, the two newspaper companies have compiled thousands of volumes of excellent news education films, organized dozens of film teams, and toured the country's rural areas, enthusiastically promoting film education for the masses. Recently, they have also added sound film teams. Since the establishment of the All-Japan Film Education Research Association, its business organization has been increasingly promoted. The association's office is located within the two newspaper companies. Branches are established in places with 50 or more members as the central organization for local film education movements. As of July 1932, a total of 44 branches had been established nationwide, with tens of thousands of special and ordinary members. In addition, in order to cultivate local film education movement guidance talents, the association holds a film education summer training course once a year in selected locations, which is quite reputable.</p>
<p>The Daimei Film Library is located in Osaka City. The Tonichi Film Library is located in Tokyo City. In addition, there are seven branch libraries distributed in Manchuria, Taiwan, Korea, Moji, Kumamoto, Kanazawa, Nagoya, etc., with a collection of more than 4,000 film reels, all classified and cataloged, and carefully stored. The number of films extracted and screened daily averages about 30,000 meters at the Daimei headquarters alone. Their greatest goal is to create a nationwide public film education network.</p>
<p>In addition, all countries in the world have specific film education movements and review systems, but due to space limitations, they will not be listed further. (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Pi Pa Yuan" (Grievance of the Lute)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>"Pi Pa Chun Yuan" (Spring Grievance of the Lute)! Judging from this sentiment-filled title, we can well imagine that this must be a tragedy.</p>
<p>Originally, a tragedy is very easy to move people's emotions, and of course, it is easy to please, but it must have good subject matter, and it must accurately grasp this subject matter, so that this subject matter can be fully developed, and use artistic understanding to correctly analyze it, and use the form of tragedy to stimulate the audience, so that the audience can recognize the core of a certain event without distortion under the touch of the picture, and immediately feel their own way out. Thus, the issue of the film producer's ideology is raised here.</p>
<p>So, what central issue did our producers raise in "Pi Pa Chun Yuan"? What we can see on the screen is that the scenario writer expresses dissatisfaction with the deep-rooted feudal forces in the current countryside. A husband and a widow should get married if they have fallen in love, but he tells us that in fact it is not so simple. They finally cannot stand the encirclement of feudal etiquette and finally succumb to the power of feudal forces. Of course, we do not deny that there are indeed many such women in Chinese villages. They only have cowardly feelings and endless tears. But should we let this shameful situation continue forever? Boldly say "No." Then such a cowardly widow should not appear on the most educationally significant screen and become a typical example for women of generally backward standards. The film does expose the power of feudal forces to some extent, and it also adds humor to ridicule women who have affairs themselves but advise others to maintain chastity. However, this is far from enough. It is a tragic writing with no way out.</p>
<p>It is not a new Realism art work from beginning to end. It not only lacks anti-feudal forces, but on the contrary, it preaches for feudal forces.</p>
<p>As for the performance of this film, the director's artistic descriptive skills are still commendable in some places. After Li Lingxian died of her husband and returned to her hometown, the director tried his best to describe her meticulously, which is particularly suitable for tragedy. However, in the first half of the scenes, it is inevitable to make people laugh. Moreover, in terms of plot, it could not be more "coincidental." Li Lingxian's appearance is exactly the same as that of Doctor Ma's deceased wife. Some of the sets reveal traces of being fake, especially the goose-feather snow, which makes people know at a glance that it is paper scraps flying. The heroine should not be so flashy when she comes to Shanghai from the countryside, because the simplicity of the countryside and the luxury of the city are quite flavorful in contrast.</p>
<p>Gao Qianping's weakness and incompetence are quite well portrayed. But it is very inadequate, especially the first half is not good. Zheng Xiaoqiu has no brilliance. Yiqiu is the best actor. Zhang Minyu has a lot of performing "genius."</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Pi Pa Chun Yuan" (Grievance of the Lute)</h3>
<p>Opening at the Central and Shanghai theaters</p>
<h3>After Watching "Qing Sheng" (The Love Expert)</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>"Qing Sheng" (The Love Expert) Holly Lovel is Ronald Colman's glorious nickname, and another "Qing Sheng" (The Love Expert) Cynara is Ronald Colman's new film. It is a good story to have a "Qing Sheng" (The Love Expert) star in a "Qing Sheng" (The Love Expert) film. The story of this film is very simple. It tells of a young couple who are separated for a long time due to an incident. The young husband meets a girl. However, because he is already married and his wife has soon returned, he breaks off contact with the girl. Unexpectedly, the girl is deeply in love and commits suicide. Although he does not bear any legal responsibility, the society satirizes him for being unfaithful. He has no choice but to go out to sea. His wife can also understand him, so he and his wife go to find paradise elsewhere.</p>
<p>A film of 10,000 feet has only a short plot. Of course, this gives the actors many opportunities to develop. Although Colman is old, he is in good spirits, and his skilled and calm performance is even more commendable. From beginning to end, it is impeccable. The young husband he plays expresses the "dilemma" in a few scenes of love lightly and meticulously. From his calm movements, he reveals deep and sincere "affection." His wife is played by Kay Francis. This is their second collaboration. She has many places where the performance is superior. The girl's suicide is Rhylls Barry. She has a better performance than Francis. The swimming scene fully shows the beauty and seductiveness of women. Every frown and smile is enough to make people feel pity and love.</p>
<p>The director is King Vidor, the director of "The Barbarian." He has strong skills and is admirable. However, in this film, the young couple are separated for seven years, and looking at them before their separation and after their reunion, it does not seem like such a long time. It seems to be a miscalculation by the director. The photography and lighting are very good. In terms of editing, the contrast and comparison of the whole film are extremely beautiful. Small shots Closeup add color.</p>
<p>Its location shooting is quiet and beautiful, making people feel refreshed. The film's delicate performance and artistic integration completely do not lose the advantages of silent films.</p>
<p>The plot is rare in American films. It painfully criticizes young people's blind love. It is improper and strives to promote the ethics of couples.</p>
<p>It is a meaningful film. Although there are many small loopholes, I will not mention them one by one. Although it does not stimulate tension, it can also move the audience's emotions.</p>
<h3>Talking About Spring Tide</h3>
<p>— Ai Xia</p>
<p>Spring Tide, Spring Tide is my such a vivid name. This is Turgenev's novel, now adapted into a script by Zheng Yingshi of Tingsheng Company, and directed by Zheng, with Yan Hemian as the photographer and sound recorder.</p>
<p>Since it is a famous work, this film will probably have considerable success.</p>
<p>In today's China, it is originally very difficult to produce sound films. Mr. Yan knows the need for Chinese sound films. Under constant efforts, Heming is successful, and Tingsheng Company is produced as a result. They are not capitalists, they are doing it poorly, and they have a spirit of unity and fearlessness of difficulties.</p>
<p>Spring Tide tells of a young man Zhang Guohua falling in love with his cousin Yan Yuying, but his cousin is betrothed to a wealthy young man by her mother in a commercial marriage due to economic pressure. Yan Yuying is extremely dissatisfied. As a result, she divorces the rich young man, and the other party asks for the money previously provided to be returned. They are so poor that after discussing, Zhang Guohua decides to go to the countryside to sell the land. Unfortunately, the buyer is a seductive young lady, and Zhang Guohua is thus addicted to the temptation of the flesh.</p>
<p>Yan Yuying went to work due to the pressure of life. Poor her, she is still thinking of her cousin. Soon she fell ill. Zhang Guohua had been felt tired of and driven out by the seductive young lady at this time. He hated it to the extreme and shot her to death, surrendered himself to prison, and at the same time, his cousin also died of illness. The whole play ends like this.</p>
<p>What is the consciousness? I will not talk much about it now. As far as I know, the technique of this film has made considerable contributions.</p>
<h3>Small News</h3>
<p>Mr. Griffis, the manager of Fox Company at 21 Museum Road, has been in the film business for many years, is skilled in business, and the film that is popular with everyone, Jenny Gaynor and Clifford, is one of the company's great productions. Mr. Ge recently went to Hong Kong for important business. The manager of Rongrong Company (i.e., the general management office of the Great Shanghai Theater) Mr. Li hosted a banquet at Mingyuan the night before to give him a send-off. The guests included several directors of the company and the chairman of the Film Association, Mr. Naiaito. The host and guests were very happy.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Sign of the Cross (4)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Everyone agreed with Mark's suggestion to see what Ancaria could do to warm Marcia's icy heart. Ancaria wanted to move her heart with singing and dancing. But Marcia looked quite uneasy. At this time, from the prison outside where Christians were imprisoned, suddenly came a tragic and joyful song. This joy of regarding death as home really made the general Romans, including Marcus, feel confused and incomprehensible after hearing it. He ordered Ancaria to sing louder, to suppress the song of praise to God in that "heretical religion," but the song outside became more and more majestic, and finally scared Ancaria to escape downstairs. The guests also all went downstairs. Only Marcus and Marcia were left upstairs. Marcus wanted to use the love between men and women again. He hugged her tightly. He kissed her and she could not refuse, but she still insisted on her faith and asked Marcus to send her back to prison. At this time, Titinus had already reported Marcus's actions to Nero. Nero was furious and immediately wanted to put Marcus to death. But the empress Sopia guided the emperor very falsely. She said that Marcus was loyal, and it would be fine to just put the Christian woman to death. So Nero ordered Titinus to bring troops to Marcus's mansion and snatched Marcia alive from Marcus's arms. Marcus did not dare to disobey because it was the emperor's edict.</p>
<p>That night, Marcus's heart was cut like a knife, and he could not sleep all night. Early the next morning, because in the afternoon of that day, after the various horse racing and wrestling competitions in the arena, there was a "axis show" of feeding living people to lions and tigers. At that time, Marcia would inevitably die, so Marcus had no choice but to run to Nero and ask for a pardon. Nero trusted Marcus very much. Although he was angry because he protected the Christians, it was also because Titinus repeatedly intervened. Now that Marcus came to ask for a pardon in person, he was quite willing to be lenient. However, the empress Sopia interfered from the middle, repeatedly blocking Nero and not allowing Marcia to be pardoned lightly. She said that such pardon of Christians was not what a loyal servant should ask for. But Marcus said,</p>
<p>"I only ask for this, but, Your Majesty, you cannot say that I am not loyal. Empress, don't you still know my loyalty to Nero?" Marcus asked Nero again, saying, "Emperor Nero, I have the right to ask for these small favors. I have obeyed you and glorified you. I have fought east and west for you, and sacrificing my life is not enough. Don't you give me these little things, a woman's life, she is my beloved, my only beloved?" Marcus's voice was extremely miserable, and Nero's iron heart was also shaken. However, that woman, Sopia, her snake-like heart, was firmly unmoved. She glanced at Nero, indicating disapproval, so Nero hardened his heart again and said to Marcus, "This is impossible. I cannot make the barbarians laugh at Roman law for the sake of a woman. If you want me to save her, unless she is willing to deny her faith in public."</p>
