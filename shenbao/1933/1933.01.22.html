<h3>國聯與日正面衝突</h3>
<p>十九國特委會政東京哀的美敦書</p>
<p>限廿四小時内接受或拒絶草議案</p>
<p>日政府頑强到底竟置不理</p>
<p>一方面擬再提對案避免負决裂責任</p>
<p>中日案調解顯告失敗着手草擬報告</p>
<p>我代表團發表宣言</p>
<p>主張調解委員會直接對國聯大會負責</p>
<p>重申取消僞滿國及邀美俄合作兩要義</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國特委會今晚開會、因對日本覆文難於接受、調解無從進行、决議立即着手起草按照盟約第十五條第四項之報告、下星期一提出討論、但起草報告期間、苟能發見調解可能、仍將努力從事云、（中央社二十一日下午七時二十一分電）</p>
<p>（南京）外息、十九委員會二十日以日覆訓未到、延會至廿一日下午五時、調解似已絶望、俟下週初西門返日内瓦後、混沌局勢必可判明、國聯一味遷就日本、果能於絶境中覓得調解之途徑乎、抑根據盟約十五條四項以草擬報告乎、咸於此時决之、至我國態度始終抱定强硬政策、凡於我不得者、不論其爲何項方式、一槪拒絶云、（廿一日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今日午後集會、决定向日本發出哀的美敦書性質之文、限其於二十四小時接受或拒絶一月十八日之建議、即取銷邀請美俄兩國參加調解之議後、日本應接受十二月二十日草議案其餘各項及理由說明書是也、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）十九特委會要求日政府對其星期三日之提議、予以切實之答覆、日政府置之不理、今日電諭駐日内瓦之日代表接受「德魯蒙方案」、而删除邀請非會員國一條、日外務省希望此項辦法可被接受、但諷示如特委會堅持一月十八日之提議、則日本唯有以「否」字答之耳、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表團已接奉東京訓令、定今晨集議考慮送交特委會主席希孟之覆文、一般人料日代表之覆文必有再提答案之性質、表示日本欲避免决裂、尤不欲抛棄調解手續之意、十九特委會對於日方此種答案、將如何應付之、此乃衆所猜測之事、但有必須承認者、一再延宕與無窮討論、現漸引起不堪再忍之緊張空氣、雖大國現亦贊成不再拖延、而進行第二步矣、（二十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本代表團所期待之訓令、頃已奉到、日本政府對於十九國委員會提出之確切問題已另提一對案、由此可見日本不欲使談判破裂、十九國委員會將於午後四時開會、以便正式接收日本對案、（二十一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨國聯大會議長孟告記者、自接日本兩復電後、時局已稍簡單、惟不允切實說明時局簡單化之趨向、亦不願給予十九國委員會調解失敗之印象、按東京兩電今晨抵達日代表團後、立由松岡轉送希孟與秘書長德魯蒙、第一電係答復十九國委員會星期三之提議、第二電則完全贊成日代表於星期五送至十九國委員會之對案、查此項對案現尙未經委員會考慮、現消息靈通之國聯中人、皆係倘東京對於十九國委員會提議之答復、係屬否定語調、則目下幾可確定十九國委員會爲將於今日午决定動議第十五欵第四節倘十九國委員會進行援用第四節、料先將推舉小組委員會、考慮各項草案、最後復交十九國委員會討論、英代表團現主張報告書内、應㈠採用李頓報告、㈡切實聲明國聯會員國不能承認滿洲之設立獨立國、俾報告書内包含最近事實、目下贊成英人此種主張者似已甚衆、但英人主面亦謂李頓報告未免已稍陳舊、因關於邇來中日衝突、連榆關事件在内、皆侮調查團離遠東後所發生、惟認國聯大會對於此種事件、不能表示立塲、因尙未得可靠而不偏袒之報告故也、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>我代表團宣言</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會中國代表團今晚發表宣言、内稱「上年十二月二十六日中國代表團曾向十九國委員會提出修正案、最近與十九國委員會主席及團聯會秘書長談話時、中國修正案合於决議草案精神一層、亦被承認、但何以至今十九國委員會對於此事、未予正式答復、本代表團深以爲異、本代表團雖繼續忍耐、但各報時時登載消息、謂十九國委員會對於决議草案、有容納重大修改之傾向、而此項修改案、中國代表方面始終未接正式通知、本代表團因此不勝失望、爲求事實之完全明瞭起見、本代表團認爲上年年底提交十九國委員會之備忘錄、有予以公布之必要、本代表團並以爲不承認「滿洲國」、及不使「滿洲國」繼續存在之原則、應在决議草案以内、明白揭示之、本代表團對於此層、不憚反覆言之、蓋中國絶不能任人破壞其領土之完整也、」</p>
<p>中國代表團又稱、「最後十六個月以來、中國爲和平計、始終表示妥協精神、即最近對於决議草案所提出之修正案、亦以十九國委員會原案之意旨與目的爲依歸、尤足證明中國妥協之精神、但中國鑒於國聯會盟約所賦予之義務、及爲維護正義起見、凡關於國聯會基本原則之問題、未便有所遷就、假使不承認「滿洲」現行制度之原則、未能明白列入决議草案之内、則中國不能接受調解、此外中國代表團以爲美俄兩國在遠東有重大利益、非由各該國合作、則任何調解均難經久、甚或不能接受、又謂李頓調查團中原有美國代表、當時曾經行政院全體代表一致贊可、即日本亦在其内、此外俄國代表參加調解、尤足使美國有參加之必要、中國代表團以爲提議中之調解委員會、當作爲十九國委員會之分委員會、而不當作爲新設之機關、又此分委員會中、大國與小國之代表額數、應保存原有之比例、俾能確實表現非常大會之精神、即十九國委員會所自出之精神、至分委員會之權限、中國代表團認爲不僅以居間爲事、蓋惟分委員會與雙方當事國會同談判、方能得到一良好之解决故也、藉非然者、中日兩國直接交涉、分委員會僅限以居間爲事、則中國代表團未能接受、中國已等待十六月之久、在此時期之中、其在生命財産上所受之犧牲、不惟甚鉅、其領土亦愈受侵略、中國所以等待者、無非希望國聯會履行盟約所載之義務、并使和平正義發揚光大而已、倘中國忍痛久待而後、仍須與日本直接交涉、則中國赞成忍耐與妥協政策、祇可認爲受罰、蓋國聯會倘在十六月以前、即告知中國謂當直接交涉、則中國政府當有其他方法、以避免新犧牲及新痛苦也、中國代表團深信國聯會盟約當由各會員國使人尊重而有以擁護之、此際惟有聯合談判方式、并預先明定基礎、而與美俄兩國合作、庶調解乃有最後成功之機會」云云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>特委會前日開會情形</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）二十日十九特委會會議、歷一小時又四十分鐘、主席希孟聲稱、國聯未直接接到日本對於星期三日建議之覆文、僅日代表松岡來談、提出關於所謂德魯蒙與杉村間折中方案之若干次要建議云、愛爾蘭人表勒斯特</p>
<p>提議休會　至明日、俾日政府對於星期三日之建議、發出切實覆文、特委會贊成此議、旣有此决定後、特委會遂討論如日本覆文果如一般人預料之不美滿、則國聯將何以應付之、於是衆議及根據盟約第十五條第四節繕具報告之問題、聞英代表艾登提議應組織起草小組委員會、以考慮方案、其他委員亦有提議數起、但英代表團顯然贊成李頓報告書之通過、特委會至是休會、至明日午後五時復開、今晚七時五十分</p>
<p>發出出報　原文如下、「十九特委會今日午後集會、以希孟爲主席、希孟報告渠已接到日代表自己發動之提議、但渠奉十九特委會命於星期三日送交日代表團轉達東京之問題、則迄未得覆、此問題所言者、爲十九特委會在日本接受十二月特委會所擬草議案其他各條之條件下、有接受日本修正文取銷邀請非會員國一節之可能、特委會現决定休會至明日、庶日政府可發出其覆文、特委會已交換意見、討論在兩造間不能覓得同意後所慮採用之手續」云、苟一般人所預料者、果眞實現、則國聯即將着手</p>
<p>繕具報告　書之困難工作、今日出席於十九特委會者、有新到日内瓦之捷克代表皮尼士、及英代表艾登、艾登似欲努力和緩若干委員之不忍耐態度、但並不妨及明日之會議、主席希孟於申述近事後、謂現有之唯一問題、爲一種新提議、據日代表稱、如特委員贊成此提議、則日代表團可謀取東京之同意、會衆對主席此言、加以討論、大都以爲此種提議决不能適當應合星期三日特委會休會時所議定「如日本接受議案中其他條欵、則非會員國可不邀請」之辦法、故在此情形下、一般意見以爲希孟若宣讀此新提議、殊屬無益、於是愛爾蘭代表勒斯特乃主張休會、會議時屢有人言及日人</p>
<p>延宕曠時　英代表艾登建議不妨現即組織起草委員會、開始繕具報告書、以免多曠時日、如日後覺調解尙屬可能、則此繕具報告之工作、儘可終止、德代表等數人贊成此說、但終未通過也、在此最後階級中、事已顯然共覩者、十九特委會希望日本對於星期三日特委會方面之建議、予以「或是或非」直截了當之答覆、國聯秘書長方面發出一文、說明所謂备魯蒙與</p>
<p>杉村方案　之起原、謂秘書長與主席希孟同受命在此决議案上進行談判、而不碍及其原則、當秘書長假滿歸來時、杉村來訪、討論杉村所認爲十九特委會與日本皆可接受之辦法、其中包括邀請美俄參加討論之可能性、當時秘書長告以渠不能担任十九特委會可接受此議、渠以爲欲勸特委會接受之、恐非易事、此項辦法旋電達東京、而東京復加以修正、其最著者、爲關於邀請非會員國參加討論一事云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇炳文馬占山日軍暴行報告</h3>
<p>送達日内瓦</p>
<p>（日内瓦）蘇炳文與馬占山在俄合編之日軍在東三省暴行記錄、已抵我代表部、我代表决定送交國聯、爲解决中日紛爭之參考、（二十一日華聯電）</p>
<h3>美新舊總統遠東政策一致</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）現任總統胡佛與當選總統羅斯福昨到會議時、聞曾討論遠東爆裂性發展之危險、羅式允繼續胡佛史汀生不承認武力奪得的土地、及不承認、「滿洲國」之主義、胡佛對此、頗爲忻悅、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國登高一呼英報改變論調</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間各週刋對於日本有一致之抨擊、週末雜誌稱、日人聞英外相西門柔軟的良心裁判之詞、不獨無動於中、且加訕笑、而華人對於西方尊重條約之程度、現有當然之失望、漸呈憤懣不平之危險氣象云、新政治家週刋稱、日人和解之希望、業已消滅、日人所已得者、日人現保持不失、國聯盟約與非戰公約悉成廢紙、李頓調查亦成滑稽、而國聯亦成廢物云、旁觀家週刋稱、就種種證據觀之、日本决不接受十九特委會之决議、而不承認「滿洲國」一條、尤爲日本所不願甘服、美國當選總統羅斯福適於此時聲明繼續確認國務卿史汀生不承認以破壞國際條約的手段而造成的時局之主義、此中有深長意味在也云云、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>内外相内田演說外交方針</h3>
<p>竟謂卵翼僞國可致東方和平</p>
<p>我國鞏固熱防反妄指爲侵略</p>
<p>誣我赤化企圖淆亂世界視聽</p>
<p>（東京）貴族院今晨十一時開會、内田外相演說政府外交方針、其全文如下、</p>
<h3>關於僞國事件</h3>
<p>帝國政府根據於旣定方針、於去年九月十五日與「滿洲國」政府簽訂議定書、帝國政府以　承認「滿洲國」爲獨立國家、同時規定[滿洲國]尊重帝國及帝國臣民在該國内所有之條約上一切權益、日「滿」兩國　於對於「滿洲國」之一切、咸與帝國康寗有關、規定帝國軍隊駐紮「滿洲國」内、以共同防衛國家、即簽訂該議定書之結果、擁護日本在滿權益及確保「滿洲國」對於内外脅威之基礎已確立、而維持東方和平之有力保障實現矣、「滿洲國」其後漸次發達、國内集團的兵匪亦漸潰滅、國内狀勢之改善顯著、誠不勝慶幸之至、而此狀態對於該國通商貿易及財政上與以最好影響者、固不待言、因此現在滿洲國人及留滿日僑與外僑一律蒙　慶福焉、此事實即實際上證明日本政府承認新國家爲解决滿洲問題保全遠東和平之唯一方法之見解者也、余鑒於如上所述、滿洲國現在之良好狀態與其慶福、及於中外人之事實、深信國聯及列國必致認識帝國所取態度爲公正妥當者、余又不疑中國國民將來諒解中日滿三國、各以獨立國之資格、互相扶助之事、爲確保遠東和平之最善方法、</p>
<h3>關於熱河問題</h3>
<p>關於熱河問題、余所欲加一言者、爲滿蒙與中國以長城爲境界、此事考查歷史、則無議論餘地、且熱河省爲「滿洲國」之一部分、徵之滿洲國宣言亦可明白矣、然最近熱河省内非獨有擾亂治安者、又有張學良麾下之正規軍越過國境侵入省内、日滿議定　規定滿洲國領土由兩國共同負責維持治安、故所謂熱河問題爲滿洲國内部之問題、同時日本因用條約上之義務、對於此問題抱有重大關心、</p>
<h3>誣我政局混亂</h3>
<p>中國政局仍然混亂、而排日運動未見緩和、據報國民黨中央委員去年十二月在南京開全體會議、提交關於北華邊疆之軍事行動、援助東北義勇軍及排斥日貨之三項積極抗日案、其後據由各方接到之各種情報、此項積極抗日案者、確實通過該會議、而近來不但中國軍隊在中國與滿洲國國境附近集結、其一部分已經侵入熱河省内、帝國政府現正衷心重視中國如此狀態、關於或將由此事態招致之不幸的結果、余不得不督促中國政府及其國民喚起嚴重注意及其反省也、</p>
<h3>關於李頓報告</h3>
<p>關與中日問題有關係之所謂李頓報告書、於去年十月提交國聯理事會、帝國政府對其意見書、亦於十一月提出理事會、兩者均已經公表、日本意見書内容、由各方面觀點詳細說明帝國政府以承認滿洲國而助成其健全發達爲確保遠東和平唯一方法之基本的見解、政府於國聯理事會或大會及其他與諸列國交涉之機會、懇切說明此意見書主旨、去年十二月宣告暫時休會之十九國委員會、業於本月十六日重開、繼續討論中日問題、日方决定今後每於該會議及國聯其他諸會議開會之機會努力、徹底主張該意見書内之主張、帝國政府從來以誠實援助國聯事業、並努力增進其權威、而對於國聯爲遠東和平及其福祉之努力、亦有好意的協力之充分準備者、不釐多言、然帝國政府在意見書中所述當國聯審議與中國有關係之問題時、應　於該國狀態之複雜難澀性、及變則的特色空氣之濃厚、使其所引用之國聯盟約時使有充分伸縮性、爲最必要、蓋普通諸國家之間所實施之國際法上諸項原則及慣例、在中國則加以大變改施行之、故不能祇以國聯盟約爲其例外、即以根據於該盟約在歐州實施之先例、欲在中國適用盟約、則其結果不能符同於實際事情、非獨反使事態愈變惡化、且傷國聯權威、此爲世界和平極危險、欲保持遠東和平、一方須要中日滿三國之協力與提携、他方又要三國間之圓滿協調也、</p>
<h3>關於對俄外交</h3>
<p>蘇俄聯邦政府自滿軍發生以來、取極愼重之態度、迄今幸未與日本之間、發生任何不愉快之事件、此不勝爲日滿俄三國額手稱慶、中俄國交最近恢復、因此常聞遠東全體之赤化運動更將活潑之說、此觀察之是否正當、兹暫不論、唯旣有共産黨及共産軍活動之長江沿岸及華南一帶、如因中俄復交、增加赤化勢力、則此事爲遠東和平上重大事件、帝國政府當然極注意其前途、至於日俄不侵犯之問題、爲前年在北平成立之日俄基本條約之精神、又爲兩國均已簽字之非戰公約所規定、兩國間實附上之關係、亦絶無侵犯之事、但對於此精神、規定及此實際關係、欲加以形式的不侵犯條約、則自然發生關於時期方法等之種種見解、即去年春季俄政府提起此問題以來、各方面有種種議論、帝國政府鑒於本問題有如此種種議論、認爲未到與俄政府商議或訂立不侵犯條約之時期、故於去年底以此主旨答復蘇俄政府、日政府雖對俄政府回答如此、然日本對於蘇俄毫無侵略意圖者、自不待言、余信在蘇俄政府亦决無誤解此事也、</p>
<h3>關於軍縮會議</h3>
<p>一般軍縮會議、去年二月在日内瓦開會、關於陸海空三軍進行討論種種重要案件、然該會議羅致世界各國代表、爲係空前未有之大會議、因各國期望自國國防之安全、又其利害關係已甚複雜、現尙未見一致、然縮少軍備爲和平事業、非獨係國際聯盟重要任務之一、現在世界各國最關心問題之一也、帝國政府對於諸事業熱誠協力之方針、始終一貫、毫無變動、故今次會議、日本全權與各國代表協力專心努力於會議之成功、帝國政府於去年提出世界海軍備重大縮减案件之用意、亦不外於此目的、該提案主張縮少各種艦船之形態、全廢航空母艦、减少甲級巡洋艦之艘數、及乙級巡洋艦與驅逐艦之總噸數、據此計劃、日英美法意五國之航空母艦及甲級巡洋艦、得縮减一百三十萬噸左右、日本提案以今次會議通過之减少攻擊勢力增加防禦勢力原則、爲其基礎、而採此原則、優勢海軍國當然比劣勢海軍國爲大犧牲、如對於兩國施行同一率之縮减、則劣勢海軍國之安全將感受大損害、日本提案又愼重考慮關係各國之主張、如各國充分研究日本提案、則余信各國必能諒解其公正合理的日實際的主張也、試觀世界財界之現狀、除有四十四國停止金本位制度、因銀價之暴落及匯市之混亂、其貿易受損失外、各國爭設限制輸出入、禁止輸出入、提高關稅等種種通商上之障壁、實行所謂産業貿易上之鎭國主義、結果從來進行健全發達之通商自由大原則、遂見一大反轉、此實不堪遣憾、然最近熱心研究除去世界經濟不安方法之氣連頗顯著、日本亦有協力進行此種國際的努力之方針、因不久開會之世界經濟財政會議、亦根據於上述主旨、故日政府常派代表出席該會議之準備委員會、與各國共同進行各種預備的研究、以上旣述當面之各種外交問題</p>
<h3>所謂政府見解</h3>
<p>最後欲一言者、爲帝國政府之見解、帝國外交之根本義存於確保遠東和平及世界和平者不贅多言、據帝國政府之所見、鑒於現下國際社會之實情、欲招致眞實和平、則要承認以維持和平爲目的之　原則的普遍性、而當其運用、則應實際的事情、使之有適當之伸縮性、同時尊重世界各方面能實現維持和平之勢力爲最緊要、因此之故、日本認國聯會章中規定地方的諒解爲賢明之事、同時認識在遠東方面之帝國建設的勢力、爲維持該方面和平之現實的支柱、而企圖該方面和平之維持、帝國對於世界任何地方决無領土的野心、又不欲對世界任何國家釀成事件、帝國之所企圖者、爲根據於國防正義、確保帝國生命線、同時與鄰接諸邦　力提携、確保遠東康寗、以貢獻維持世界和平、而在遠東以其權威及實力欲達成此目的、此爲日本國民之信念也、帝國外交自明治以來之根本精神、實存乎於此、對於前述滿洲問題、日俄關係及國聯之態度、均係根據於此精神者、又帝國對於軍縮會議之提案、亦出於同一之精神者也、帝國政府在上述根本精神之下、擬各國間保持最親善之關係、以圖通商之圓滑、與文化之融合、並期實現世界人類更高尙之理想也、（二十一日日聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國聯調解熱河垂危</h3>
<p>㈠國聯之所謂調解</p>
<p>國聯本身之不健全。已爲世界所共知尤爲吾人所深悉。蓋執世界金融牛耳之北美合衆國雖爲發起人。而成立之後竟居局外。占全球陸地七分之一之蘇聯。亦非國聯會員在各大國中所謂忠實盟員者在歐洲爲英爲法。在東方則爲日本而歐洲大陸資本主義各國。除德意兩國而外多惟英法兩在國之馬首是瞻。德意志與意大利雖各義揮其本能努力上進德國戰敗十五年來。備受凡爾賽和約之束縛現雖力圖振作。然外受各國之關稅封鎖。内遭市面頽廢失業者激增之困頓决無餘力以過問國外。主張國際的公道正義意大利洵爲南歐之强。地中海上有力者之一惟處此世界蛻變之際。繼爲法西斯蒂之領袖而天産貧弱其煤鐵之埋藏量。不及日本之四分之一。故除就近在非洲開拓之外。决難舊飛於世界。是故國際聯盟五常任理事國中。惟英法能。指揮如意其一舉一動均足以左右國聯。於是日本乃往還於英法兩國之間。誘之以市塲利得動之以赤化防禦遂得安然占領東北矣。我國政府自前年九一八事變後。即秉其一貫之忍耐政策。向國聯要求扶植眞理正義。靜等國聯對東北三省之伸其正義而珠還合浦。</p>
<p>殊不知彼狡獪老辣之日本帝國主義者。旣已得英法之諒解席捲東三省。囊括山海關於是對世界公言「滿洲」早非吾國所有熱河且劃入滿蒙範圍。李頓調查團報告書第十章。亦以爲「日本在熱河省現在享有之權力。予以維持。」是則明明認熱河屬於滿蒙範圍。至少亦擴大日本掠奪所得之權益矣。日本於此。并不以爲滿足。更不欲以其侵略所得權利。分配於列强。且須國聯承認其武力所製造之「滿洲（傀儡）國。」以遂其侵略之企圖。至於國聯之所以遲滯復遲滯遷延復遷延之眞實理由。并非有所愛於我國或爲正義而然也。實乃欲在東北三省（日本所謂之滿洲（傀儡）國）取得若干經濟利益。日本僅口頭表示對華無領土野心。而彼所謂之國際正義。乃「生命線之確保」換言之。即武力占據「滿洲」是也。</p>
<p>㈡事變已擴大至於關内</p>
<p>今試舉一月二十一日内田外相對貴族院之演說以明之。内田之。言曰。</p>
<p>『···承認新國家。助成其發展。是把滿洲問題擺在健實的基礎上而解决。并且確信這是保全東洋和平的唯一方法。···』</p>
<p>『究竟。日滿華三國各自獨立。相扶相助是保持東洋和平的最善方法。···』</p>
<p>『熱河是「滿洲」之一部徵。諸同國建立的經緯就明白了。然而最近擾亂該省治安豈但事實顯著并且張學良麾下的正規軍隊有越國境侵入的樣子。屬於「滿洲國」境的維持治安是日滿議定書中。兩國所共同擔負的責任。所以熱河問題純然是「滿洲國」的内部問題。同時是我方（日本）在條約上義務最關心的事。···』</p>
<p>『對熱河境内的侵入。前面已經講過帝國衷心重視中國這樣的狀態恐怕這種事態招來不幸的結果所以豫先要喚起中國正府和國民深切的注意。更促其反省。···』</p>
<p>内田此種語調旣漠視中日國交竟以僞國與我併列而提出荒謬絶倫之「三國···相扶相助」且認我軍在我國境内之移動爲「擾亂治。安」則日軍無故侵我遼吉黑。砲轟榆關豈非强寇乎。</p>
<p>同時吾人於讀内田外相演說詞之後。應深切認識必須亟起努力鬥爭以自救。</p>
<p>第一。榆關失陷苟安之局已不可倖存敵寇已深。萬難偷惰。</p>
<p>第二。朝陽寺。北票等地。已入敵手。熱邊且被轟炸再事隠忍恐將無生存餘地矣</p>
<p>第三一年半以來我政府充分信賴國聯維持和平。現時所謂二十四小時内答覆之通牒亦不過徒托空言决不能裁制日本。</p>
<p>第四吾人須知内田康哉爲日本軍部之代言人其所表示頗足以代表軍部之行動。現今熱河爲我所必爭。亦爲敵所覬覦。設使不幸而熱河步北滿之後塵者。則平津以至河北山東。且又不保矣日本之貪慾無窮。蠶食之禍尤甚於鯨呑也。</p>
<p>我國民際此危機所應深切反省者無他惟鐵與血之鬥爭而已。以鐵血禦暴寇乃能於百死之中。求一生路。</p>

<p>美政界聞此消息後、咸認台維斯將爲下届新國務卿、代表美國與英談判、因目下有新國務卿呼聲之諸人中、僅台氏參加今日重要會晤也、今日兩總統係在白宮内紅室晤談國務卿史汀生·財長米爾士與台維斯及羅斯福氏之經濟顧問摩萊均在塲、事後、胡佛總統即聲稱、英國曾要求討論戰債、新政府將樂於在三月初招待英代表、届時當然必需討論及英美互相有關之世界經濟問題、故並將派遣策劃世界狀况進步方法之代表云云、胡佛此次代新舊兩政府聲明一切、衆認爲兩總統對於兩大重要財政問題完全同意之明證、美國旣在世界經濟會議籌備委員會中獲得勝計、在其議程剔除戰債問題、目下得以更廣闊之範圍、自由討論戰債問題、惟此問題若不解决、仍足爲經濟回榮之障碍、故胡佛總統從籌備委員會之建議、謀其早日解决、現信英國戰債問題、或者即在世界經濟會議開幕前了結、亦全屬可能之事、今日美經濟界聞此消息、莫不認爲建設的佳音、因此紐約證券交易所市價、亦隨之見漲云、</p>

<p>塔斯社二十一日莫斯科電　關於日報因蘇聯發表日蘇不侵犯條約交涉經過而生之反響、塔斯社現已確知蘇聯政府未嘗能不發表交涉之内容及雙方之文字、故對於此點、蘇聯絶對不受何種責任之束縛、日蘇訂立不侵犯條約之問題、係由蘇聯政府所提出、此問題旣爲公開提出、且在世界報紙上公開討論者達一年、日本報紙尤多討論之、蘇聯政府殊無意將其交涉經過向蘇聯之民衆隠瞞云、</p>

<p>近因舊歷年關在邇、日方麻醉華人、粉飾太平、由各地日本主要機關、散發春聯神祇、如天地皇君、每機關團體商店、各發給多份、强令應時張貼、并令吉遼長哈黑各大埠僞建國宣傳委員會籌備舊歷新年同樂會、舉辦龍燈高蹻等下級雜技、用誘華人於忘國忘憂之途、但各團體及商店於此環境下及亡國奴隸中、烏有此種興趣、猶憶陽歷新年時、日本極力壓迫商民團體擲柬賀年、顧商民亦根本缺乏興趣、彼此心照不宣、除機關中人士外、無肯飛柬賀新禧者、於是日人對於舊歷新年、將責令負責團體、極力督促賀年、此東北亡國後、民衆思想精神、亦不容自由也、日軍侵犯熱河、頃擬編練僞國軍五個混成旅、每旅四團、三旅由吉遼招募、兩旅由黑龍江招募、由日方撥給軍械子彈、將令於一月内外、開往熱邊、欲先令我同族自殘、然後日軍乘我勞疲之後、攻擊前進、近日因招募不及、擬令吉林之僞勦匪軍于深澂部兩旅·及僞黑軍周作霖·王克鎭·兩支隊、編爲混成旅、即於最短期内開拔赴𤍠、第周王二人、究有一二分良心對於自殘骨肉、尙有顧忌、目前猶未肯改編、日軍因攻𤍠情切、將來或求諸其他僞軍也、（一月十一日）</p>
<h3>榆關陷後近狀</h3>
<p>戰地三十里内人烟稀少</p>

<p>昌黎通信、南自秦皇島以東、山海關以西、北首石門寨以東、九門口以西、其四圍中間三十里居民、稍有避難能力者、早已避難他去、以其地已成大戰區域、故非特人烟稀少、即猪羊家禽、变鮮有留者、其肅殺景象、可以喻矣、至於戰地近况、略述如次、</p>

<h3>敵陸戰隊登岸示威</h3>
<p>今晨（十六）四時許、秦皇島日艦之陸戰隊二十餘人突從開灤碼頭登陸、武裝闖入鐵道以南之所謂中立區域内示威挑釁、一時形勢陡緊　我軍當即妥爲防備、鐵道以南之居民、多有從睡夢中驚醒、以不知往何處去、或驚惶失措、但未幾、日兵退去、形勢亦暫緩和、特無論如何之局部緩和、終難打破日軍閥對我侵略之預定計劃也、</p>

<h3>孫科談參政會及憲法草案</h3>
<p>製定法規秋季召集</p>
<p>完成憲法最速一年</p>
<p>國聯無力惟有自救</p>
<p>立法院長孫科、偕同立法院秘書長梁寒操、三届立法委員馬超俊·簡又文·陳劍如·鍾天心·等、前晚由京來滬、昨日、本報記者訪晤孫氏、據孫談稱、國民參政會、今秋可望召集、憲法草案、最速一年方可完成、茲分誌其談話於次、</p>
<h3>參政會召集</h3>
<p>孫氏首謂、關于國民參政會之召集、業由三中全會規定在本年内召集、原案移交中央常會、再交中政會、决定國民參政會組織法之原則、然後再由立法院根據原則、草擬法規、但最近中政會方忙于討論其他重要問題、故該會組織法原則、尙未議及、預料本年秋季、可將一切法規製定、正式召集、</p>
<h3>憲法之起草</h3>
<p>孫氏繼謂、關于憲法之起草立法院已組織憲法起草委員會、委員三十餘人、爲特别愼重起見、决廣納各方意見、先分若干組、各就某一種專門問題、加以縝密之討論、各組研究之結果、報告委員會、决定一原則、送中政會審查、俟通過後、再由憲法委員會草擬憲法初稿、即聘請國内專門家、徵求對初稿之意見、俾作公開研究、以期集思廣益、然後集合各方意見、重加修正、成一完善之憲法、庶將來實行之時、不至發生困難、故憲法之完成、時間最速爲一年、</p>
<h3>民刑法修正</h3>
<p>此外關於現行民法、因未有解釋、將擬訂民法釋理、俾使執法者、知中央立法之意旨、現行刑法、大部尙係根據北京政府時代所擬訂者、諸多未合、自宜加以修訂、土地法尙有土地施行法須繼續頒布、自治法因理想太多、致内部施行諸感不便、皆須加以改革整理、勞工商法、僅具一部分、亦須完成之、總之現行諸法、外間頗多批評、其原因皆由偏重學理、不重實際、致未能切合於中國情形、此後皆須改訂之、同時因法律一問題、係專門學問、稍一不愼、即足以掛一漏萬、自非精細研究不可、</p>
<h3>救國惟自救</h3>
<p>國聯處理中日事件、已顯示毫無辦法、我國代表在國際所發表正義之呼聲、其唯一之作用、爲博得全世界輿論之同情耳、我國對日唯有决心抵抗到底、以實力爲前提、有幾分力量、用幾分力量、上下合作、抵抗到底、此次華北各將領、亦具有最大之决心、爲自衛而抵抗、不氣餒、不畏縮、蓋救國惟有自救耳、</p>
<h3>段祺瑞南下</h3>
<p>孫氏旋談及華北情形、謂段祺瑞思想雖較舊、然愛護國家、可保其决不后人、今次毅然南下、我人當然極表歡迎、蓋從此可打破一切無稽謡言、而段個人亦可不爲宵小所利用、至汪院長現留捷克温泉病院休養、大約二三星期後、即可歸國、</p>

<h3>胡西園談我國燈泡業之前途</h3>
<p>近來日泡傾銷、各方均甚注目、昨據中國亞浦耳電器廠總經理胡西園君談我國燈泡業近狀、略謂、國貨燈泡廠始於民九、逐漸增加、於民十時有粤人開辦之光亞廠、規模最巨、尙有日人開設之博利安廠、出品亦不少、不意當年因洋商燈泡競爭、泡價狂跌、上海開設之各燈泡廠、遂陸續停閉、間有資本雄厚者、亦苦於無不掙扎、不得不掩旗息鼓、民十七、爲我國手電筒所用之小電泡業最發達時期、當時小電泡成本、每百枚二元餘、市價可售四元以上、因此小電泡廠如雨後春筍、各處怒發、至去年、日貨小電泡大量進口、每百枚價祇一元二角、致我國小電泡廠、百分之九十五以上均告停閉、按電燈泡欲求其完美、同時減輕其成本、必須電學化學機械三種專家合作、一方面并有雄厚資本、供其運用、且須得到極有經騐之人才支配之、管理科學化、製作合理化、如此方能達到製作精良、成本低廉、始有立足之餘地、現在日泡大量進口、政府雖可課以傾銷稅、但傾銷並非漫無限制、且須合於傾銷法、方可適用施行、如欲我國燈泡業之生存、仍須各廠自己努力、若以傾銷　爲營業之護符、不研究出品原理、減輕成本、以投機性質開辦燈泡廠、恐仍蹈十一年之慘敗、前途未許樂觀云云、</p>

<h3>升學與學校</h3>
<p>｜簡明君來信｜</p>
<p>我是一個快要高中卒業的學生，今年才十八歲，似乎是一個很可造就的青年。但是，當我高小畢業時，成績也很好，却爲一念之差，誤進了一　蹙脚的初中裏，又是做了通學生，所以把寳貴的三年光陰，虚耗在遊閒的生活裏了。在今清夜想來，好不悔恨！悔的是誤走了途路，恨的是自己的無知。可是到畢業時，名次考試也在前十名，這是因爲大家都是撒濫污的緣故罷？後來去投考高中，第一次就被彈回，當時才覺得自己的學問知識不夠，可是追悔已不及，徒呼奈何奈何。最後，居然也考進了一個省立中學，這是很使我欣喜安慰，所以在高中的幾年裏，很用些苦功，在全體的學生裏，可算是前列的一個。光陰如矢，現在離畢業的時期祇半年，所以一個難關逼近了我的面前。（就是升學與就職的二條歧路，横在一般中學生的面前。）在我的志願上說，我很想去升學，想得些高深的學識和修養成健全的人格。現在有二個難問題。旋繞在我的腦際··</p>
<p>㈠升大學是否使我們學生的知識，學問。人格增高？現在的大學（私立的）大多是野鷄式的，只要繳足了　費，你課不上也可以，天天可以去看電影或去跳舞，校内的情形，眞是昏天黑地，醜態百出，這樣非但得不到學問知識，却把純潔的人格染　了，徒使社會上增加一個消費者，將來不能去改進國家，却把國家逼近了滅亡之路！就是國立大學，也時常閙着風潮，閙得天花亂墮，也不能去安心求學，完美的究竟是少數，所以進大學很危險，我的見解很陜窄，不知是否眞的是這樣的？</p>
<p>㈡就是升學的經費怎辦？家中很勉强供給我的學費，不過，其他的開支却要緊縮了。况且，我的父親，已五十餘歲，他爲了我兒子而受苦，我於心不忍，雖然我是獨生了。這樣想來，在高中畢業之後，我應當去找職業，就開始社會中的戰士生活？（母親時常也這樣的勸我）我現在擔憂着我的前途，在交錯的歧路上徘徊着，加以我的見解又這樣的幼稚，很容易使我墮落，所以現在特請高明的先生指示一只迷路的小羔羊的一條光路之路罷！免得他的墮落。</p>
<p>覆·來書所詢兩點，敬覆如下··㈠關於升學的學校問題。野鷄的大學固然是撒爛污，國立的學校又何嘗不撒爛污？若果我們平心靜氣的來批評　們，也可以說　們「互有短長」，然而也可以說　們「都非好貨」，因爲國立學校的好處是··（一）經費較充裕·，（二）敎授比較多，其中我專門學識的也比較多「自然這只是相對的）·，（三）參考書與實騐儀器比較完備，然而牠的壤處也不能没有，大學的敎職員接近政府，官僚氣質太重，即使有　二明達之士，亦處在一齊衆楚的環境中，没有自由發揮獨立的學說的可能，你若是要做一個縣知事或法官，那你一定要進國立大學的政法科··假使你要做個工程師，那你定要進國立大學的工科·，你若是想做普通社會科學的研究（資産階級的社會科學），那你也可以進國立大學的社會學系。但是你若眞想研究唯物論辨證法的社會科學，那你就不必去問津，因爲　們那裏並不賣這樣的貨，你去，一定是白費工夫。至於野鷄大學，自然有　多半是在做主意騙錢，買空賣空，然而若是你留心考察一下，也許會找到相當的好的野鷄大學，假使你碰到這樣的野鷄大學，那你就會看出有下述的幾種特色··（一）牠的敎授們有一些是富有新頴的思想的·，（二）牠的學風不帶多少官僚臭味·，（三）牠的敎材是比較自由的··（四）學生比較有自由討論的機會。這些好處都是你在國立學校不容易獲得的。以記者的愚見，將來的學風一定要靠着好的私立大學來挽回，國立學校不過造就一些規行矩步的人材，或則從那裏也許會出來少數的天才，然而那却不是　們敎育的力量，另有其社會原因。你的意思，以爲「不能改進國家，却把國家逼近了滅亡之路」的一定是私立大學生，即野鷄大學生，那也未必！㈡關於你的升學的經費問題。你家中旣能「勉强供給你的學費」，那已經不成問題了··就使家中「其牠開支縮减」一些，你們令尊大人又只是你一個獨子，想來自然是樂意的。假使你果然對於令尊大人不過意，你的生活就格外减省一點，除了必要的學膳費及必要的書籍費以外，不要取家中的分文，好在大學是比較自由的，你還可以做點文字投在報上，或是替人家做點工作，如日本的大學生早晨去賣報，美國的大學生晚間去給飯館裏廂洗碗，都可弄幾文補助自己的費用，並且藉此多學貧民社會接近，多多識得一些貧民生活的眞象，那你一方面旣可以弄錢，一方面也可以實行『到民間去』的這一句格言了。你眞要過社會中的戰士生活，則你無時無地不可戰，無時無地不是戰塲，你就鼓起勇氣來罷。不一定要尋着職業方『開始』，我們的生活就是鬭爭·，離開『鬭爭』，生活便没有意義，君以爲何如？</p>

<p>我國敎育部咨復外部駁斥</p>

<p>美京工部部長、於去年九月二十六日公佈命令取消外國學生課餘作工權利、已引起美國敎育界之激烈反對、依新令解釋外國留美學生依移民律非移民額、准許入境者、須證明有充分經費之準備及可靠之保證、足以維持其學生生活及身分、無論現已在美或將來准許入美之外國學生如有因圖謀利益或酬金而從事於課外營業或帮傭、移民當局認爲喪失學生之身分地位、得加以逮捕、並遞解出境云、又外國學生准許入美後、須有確定之年數、將限届滿、無論學業已否完畢、均須離境、（按從前外國留美學生如確係遵章在校上課、並無年數限制、）又自十月一日起、工部授權各開口移民局對於外國來美學生、如認爲情形「可疑」得令交保證金美金五百元方准入境、新令公佈後、美國敎育界反對、甚爲激烈、工部態度、略見緩和、據工部總移民局長HarryE·Hall函復敎育會Dr·JchnH·MacCraCken略云、工部禁上外國學生作工條例、其限制程度、業已略加修改、凡在一九三二年八月以前、業已准許入境之外國學生、如確係遵章在校、上課者得准其繼續工作、惟其報酬以膳宿爲限、不得接受工資、在假期中、亦准其繼續工作、要仍以維待膳宿爲限、又外國學生在一九三二年八月、已入美者、准其接受學額奬金Scholarhip或貸學金Fellowhip據萬國敎育會統計、現在留美之外國學生計、中國一千三百人、日本一千人、俄國五百人、英國德國各四百人、意大和二百人、印度二百人、法國一百五十人、朝鮮一百二十五人、蘇格蘭愛爾蘭巴拿馬瑞士各一百人、瑞典南非洲各七十人、威爾士二十人、總數約五千人、又據移民局統計自一九二九年、六月三十日至一九二二年七月三十一日、外國學生准許入美者、共四千七百十六名、自新章頒布後受影響之外國學生、據各方估計約在一千五百人以上、</p>
<p>自新令公布後、輿論頗爲反對、敎育界尤爲激烈、各大學校長及敎育界各人函電交馳並在無線電臺播音講演反對、聞紐約哥倫比大學及波斯頓哈佛大學等學生職業介紹部、對於外國學生仍繼續介紹、並未切實遵行新令、據此情形則此項禁止外國學生作工新令推行上、未必十分順利、然實際言之、美國目前百業蕭條失業日多美國本國學生尋覓課餘工作、尙屬不易、外國留美學生其困難更可見、就中國留美學生而言、計全美各公私立大學及專門學校、共計一千三百餘人、除清華學生中央黨部派遣學生經濟不生問題外、各省官費學生大部份不能如期匯發學費、至私費生除一部份外近二年來受銀價降落影響、大都感受經濟困難、不得不於課外覓工、以資彌補、新令施行、其影響必甚大也、查中國留美學生在新令未公布前、本有兩種不同之地位、㈠爲一九二四年以前來美之學生、現在美國者人數亦不少、大都已經畢業、且多數有相當職業能維持生活、移民局對此等學生、向採放任主義、不聞不問、此次新令公布後、於此等學生、是否發生影響、未見解釋、㈡爲一九二四年新移民律施行　來美之學生、本來限制甚嚴、此次新令、實以此等學生爲對像也、此次新令公布施行後、對於將來中國留美學生所生影響、亦有數點、㈠不能接受學額奬金及貸學金、查中國留美學生從前受公私各方學額奬金或貸學金之資助者數亦不少、新令實行後、此項權利、不能享受矣、㈡須交入境保證金、新令授權各口移民局、對於外國來美學生、如認爲可疑者、得令交保證金美金五百元、方許入境、雖並未令所有來美學生、均須交保、但移民局平時解釋條例、素從廣義、而對於東方黃種人、尤爲嚴厲、此後中國留美學生、除政府派遣之官費學生、移民局不能拒絶外、私費學生不能不將此保證金預備充足、以防入境時發生困難、㈢年數限制、新令規定學生留美年數大約學生於入境時、自行聲明或在護照公文上註明、惟一經規定、卽不能延長、卽届期學業未成、恐亦不得不離境矣、㈣無作工機會、新令公布後、將無我國學生作工機會、無待說明矣、</p>

<p>上海籃球會昨晚甲組兩塲均有劇戰、麥令對眞茹之戰、尤富興趣、麥令以聯絡之佳美、傳遞之敏捷、卒以四十六比三十六克眞茹、同濟健華之戰、形勢頗爲緊張、結果同濟僅勝一分、比數爲三十九比三十八、今晚甲組兩塲、諒有可觀、秩序如下、（按滬江球員大多離滬、今須改組、定名東華、但今晚恐不能出塲比賽、必須改期云、）</p>

<h3>同濟勝健華一分</h3>
<p>勢均力敵之下、形勢必然緊張、昨晚第一塲同濟健華、互有建樹、軒　難分、比數由二比二、直至十六比十六、或同濟佔優、或健華爭前、龍驥虎鬥、各不相讓、但自十六以後、同濟突然超前、從此健華隨後、惟上半時終了、同濟仍僅以二分估前、比分爲二十二比二十、再戰聲起、形勢如前、健華雖努力撲鬥、但無超勝機會、同濟曾以三十二比二十六勝、此區區六分、卽爲是戰相差之最大比數、而後健華力圖進取、屢有中的、曾至三十九比二十八、同濟僅以一分佔前、以爲健華不難嶄露頭角、無如時不再來、結果終以一分之差、而爲同濟獲勝、</p>

<h3>眞茹慘敗於麥令</h3>
<p>第二塲麥令斯暢所欲爲、有良好表演、眞茹（曁南）球藝、經西青兩月來之奮鬥、球藝亦多進步、　綏之下、眞茹頗見順利、許榮水韓振元連中兩球、先勝四分、麥令茂雷根勃連中、各四分之後、眞茹黃韓又加兩球、但從此麥令精神振作、來勢極猛、且以身材高大、頗佔便宜、眞茹自十比十後、卽屈居下風、頭角難露、麥令傳遞敏捷、投籃準確、上半時以二十六比十八勝眞茹、以後之二十分鐘、起初眞茹尙施支持、尹貴仁王南珍戒備極嚴、麥令自根勃首中一球後、曾有五分鐘未能增加、眞茹則連獲五分、嗣後雙方互中二球之後、麥令鋒芒又盛、眞茹困於嚴守、無法施展、黃兆霖許榮水之遠射、球皆在籃上彈出、相差毫厘、麥令一路順風、連加十二分之多、結果麥令以四十六比三十勝、</p>

<h3>一路順風</h3>
<p>約翰合大中學兩隊而成、中學雖佳、究竟經騐欠差、軍校李公瑜王士選各中二球、頓時以八比二先聲奪人、約翰以周學賢替入、果然周與誠景星亦還中三球、八比八平等、然而高凌照黃建鼎又疊加七分、從此軍校一路順風、約翰以六七分落後、及二十比十二、誠景星二次美妙射、奪回四分、上半時完結軍校、以二十四比十六勝、</p>
<h3>愈戰愈勇</h3>
<p>休息十分鐘之後、軍校五將、愈戰愈勇、約翰陣地、擊成粉碎、一中再中、一連加上十分之多、頓成三十四比十七、相差一倍、李公瑜有掷必中、軍校之勢愈盛、約翰之落後、在二十分左右、最後結果、四十八比二十八分、</p>
<h3>海賊旁觀</h3>
<p>昨晚海賊隊中如史密斯、匹雷諸人、體壁旁觀作戰、大爲研究軍校短長得失、以備星期一晚上應付、咸謂射籃之準確可驚、中鋒稍弱、後衛堅强、不絶討論對付方法、知其心中亦必怦怦然也、</p>

<h3>隕星的强烈光度</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>昔年荷蘭國曾見隕星如烈火一團，照夜不啻白晝·，飛行時其響作雷鳴，旋入北海而没。最近廣西梧州亦曾發見隕星，光度的强烈，人人亳爲罕見·，而且，挾有亘長的尾光，彷彿擴大的「九龍取水」花砲··直待飛到城的中央，漸漸的分化而消滅！一刹那間，强烈的光度竟到那裏去了？</p>
<p>「一半黑時猶有骨，十分紅處已成灰·，」這是昔人諒炭罄的詩，而寓有光度不能過於强烈的意思。假使，這顆星只在空中發出閃閃的微光，便可以永久的維持它在天空中的位置，怎會分化和消滅呢？它的分化和消滅，只爲它在發狂，它把强烈光度向一方民衆示威，激射他們的眼簾使他們不敢正視。</p>
<p>星有强烈逾分的光度，便是星的發狂·，國有强烈逾分的光度，便是國的發狂·，十九世紀的法皇拿破崙，二十世紀的德皇威廉，爲什甚終於失敗呢？便是要把强烈的光度向世界民衆示威，激射世界民衆的眼簾使他們不敢正視。</p>
<h3>中國人的偉大</h3>

<h3>到墮落之路</h3>
<p>— 烏和周</p>
<p>｜是什麽害了伊？｜</p>
<p>朋友白君寓所的前樓人家，用了個女傭，這女傭年齡很輕，受雇爲「小大姐」伊是常熟人，來上海似乎還不久，打扮很是樸素，態度也非常誠實。看來做事頗有勁，據說主人極爲信任伊。</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>三個月後，這個常熟「小大姐」，忽然向主人辭去了職務。</p>
<p>原因未明。</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>一天，白在西門電車站偶然間碰到了這個常熟「小大姐」，喲！變了，本來一「鄕下村姑」，現在竟一變而爲「摩登女性」了。這第一是從裝束上舉止上看得到燙髮，緊腰身的旗袍，有此曲線的美，才配稱上海人所謂「漂亮」。</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>又一天，白在天韻樓。這里可說是女茶房「薈萃之所」，無意間，他（白）發現了常熟「小大姐」原來側身此中。</p>
<p>丢媚眼，作蕩態，說俏皮話，浪笑·········供游客玩弄。看伊端的已和從前「判若兩人」。</p>
<p>到墮落之路。</p>
<p>是甚麽害了伊呢？</p>
<h3>詩詮</h3>
<p>— 徐絜</p>
<p>｜幾首悲壯的詩｜</p>
<p>『岳武穆滿江紅詞』靖康恥，猶未雪·，臣子恨，何時滅？駕長車，踏破賀蘭山缺！壯士饑餐胡虜肉，笑談渴飮匈奴血，待從頭收拾舊山河，朝天闕！</p>
<p>暴日之猖獗，不啻金人，茫茫神州，不知有幾人岳飛？幾人秦檜？而蘇·馬·丁·李諸壯士，又皆以退入蘇俄聞·，誰復『饑餐胡虜肉，渴飮匈奴血　耶？金　終缺，陸沉可待，誰復收拾舊山河哉！</p>
<p>『陸放翁示兒詩』死去原知萬事空，但悲不見九州同。王師北定中原日，家祭毋忘告乃翁！</p>
<p>放翁生當亂世，深知南宋不能光復河山，故有此感慨之言·，一種愛國之氣，溢於言表也，竊以爲人生莫不有死，死於牑下，盍若死於沙塲，誠所謂『萬事空』也。但悲不見九州同，今則必有五洲同之一日。螳螂捕蟬，蟬誠苦矣，而黃雀亦在其後也。嗟爾　螂，何堪驕哉！</p>
<p>『陸放翁書憤』早歲那知世事艱？中原北望氣如山··樓船暮雪瓜州渡，鐵馬秋風大散關。塞上長城空自許，鏡中衰鬚已先斑！出師一表眞名世，千載誰堪伯仲問？</p>
<p>我輩不幸，生當亂世，烽烟遍地，　鼓震天，茫茫禹域，已爲暴寇蹂躪之劇塲。文文山之不作，史道隣之已亡，慷慨吞胡羯，鬼神泣壯烈之正氣，渺不可得，又從何處覓出師表哉！昔年見一詩謎曰··「○女不知亡國恨」下綴商·趙·韓·魏·兒五字。夫『商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花，』爲唐人詩句，人多知之。因念朝鮮自亡於暴日後，忠義之士，多於中國·，而一般亡國少女，流爲妓女者頗多，檀板紅牙，清歌妙舞，不知祖國之淪亡者，比比皆是，則韓女不知亡國恨矣！豈僅我國之商女而已？蓋此詩係游朝鮮之人，目擊心傷，有感而作，改一字遂成絶句。然在暴寇視之，又將改爲「支」字矣。噫！！日人稱我國曰「支」，雖本於支那二字，實咒我『支離破碎』之意。觀其稱俄曰『露』，自以爲太陽一出，露即化散，其無憀惡毒之心可見。</p>
<h3>梁任公遣像</h3>
<p>— 張辰伯塑</p>
<h3>故鄕</h3>
<p>— 胡梯維</p>
<p>民國到了二十二年，富於情感的社會，似乎對於國人皆曰可殺的舊歷，還是藕斷絲連，餘情嫋嫋·這是五年前的一個大中佳節。那是各商家，還不必巧立名目，去掛起「夏假」的牌子，儘可以明目張膽的關門喝酒，在游戲塲，賞雷累塔。離故鄕六百里外的紅葉，因爲公司中恩賜了一塊錢的折酒，跟幾個同事攢份子，也弄了一席，閙了個酒醉飯飽。酒爲色媒。在茶餘酒後，手談這麽一局，已竟比較上算是安分的青年。這一天，十個人成了兩桌。還有兩位呢？抽着烟捲兒，實行其賭塲孝子！錢輸五塊，牌過三圈。忽然公司的聽差，替紅葉送來一封快信。這是他哥哥從Ｃ鄕寄來的。說父親的病象，日見沉劇，呌他公司裏走得脫身，便回去一趟。紅葉讀了幾句，心便砰砰的跳。在報上查查火車表，還趕得上五黠鐘的夜車。立刻雇部汽車，趕往車站。</p>
<p>無情的車輪，輾着紅葉腦海中父親的病象，是彷彿有些不妙。兩個月前，父親便患着氣喘夜間不能安眠的病。中西醫生試騐了個把月，認爲無辦法，都勸他遷地療養。於是紅葉便將父親送回Ｃ鄕。一到家，母親便吃了一驚，偷偷告訴紅葉說，父親已瘦得失了原來的神氣。紅葉爲是天天看見，到不覺得。後來又發現父親的脚背，一到晚上，高高浮腫。在Ｃ鄕有兩句俗諺。是「男怕穿靴，女怕戴帽。」母親終究急出涙來，認爲這病來勢不輕。紅葉便打算在家伺候父親，暫時不出去。可是父親不答應，說吃人家飯的，終要先公而後私，我一時不見得就死，這種病也拖上一年半載，你安心明兒出去罷。紅葉不敢違拗，只得請哥哥每日寫信來報告病况。第二天。紅葉六點鐘起身，吃了兩口飯，到父親房裏辭行。只見床上空空的，母親說，父親昨夜醒了上夜，天剛亮，就到後園吸新鮮空氣去了。紅葉聽了，如焦雷打腦，醫生所說遷地爲良的希望，又渺茫了，踏進後園，父親披了件藍緞夾袍，坐在桂花樹下的竹矮椅上。瘦削的兩頰，一頭花白的頭髪，昂着頭從眼鏡邊旁望紅葉進來，一動都不動。紅葉眼見父親這種蕭疏憔悴的神氣，感着人類天性中最悽切的悲哀，近前埀着手，</p>
<p>「爹，我去了！」</p>
<p>父親一聲不響，微微點頭。紅葉磕下頭去，一眼見黑皮拖鞋裏，盛着兩支胖胖的脚，心中一醱，再也忍不住，爬起身，眼中早滾出兩泡眼涙。父親仍是不響，睜大了眼，看紅葉帛巾抹眼。眼角上，彷彿已有些潮灦，因爲紅葉從出世到現在，没曾見父親吊過涙。</p>
<h3>上海夜話</h3>
<p>— 張若春</p>
<p>異國青年</p>
<p>一九三三年一月十日的午夜，我第一次踏道「黑眼睛」半夜舞塲。</p>
<p>詩人Ｗ，陪着　都ＸＸ委員會的武裝火伴。到銀葉樓來，邀我同到霞飛路去，做夜之巡禮。</p>
<p>「往那裏去好呢？」</p>
<p>三人行，最後的决定··到黑眼睛去探險。</p>
<p>走進一條黑暗的陜弄，一座紅墻璧中國舊式住宅，門前掛了幾枝給風雨吹浸壞了　松柏，輕輕推進門去，一　吉白色婦人，有氣無力地抬起頭來，朝我們望了一眼。</p>
<p>我們把外　大衣，交給了一個穿皇室制服的老人，從容不迫，走完古怪顔色壁　的甬道，給一個面清目秀的俄羅斯青年攔住了。</p>
<p>他抱住了同去的武裝火伴，嘴裏說着聽不清楚的大英話，像是要求跳舞的樣子。一股「伏特加」的酒氣，直撲過來，中人欲嘔。我們是三個人，而且都有火伴氣質的人，當然，决不怕什麽人的，我們把他請到裏面一隻小方桌邊，四個東西南北各人佔了一個坐位。</p>
<p>剛吩咐侍者預備四杯黑咖啡，那個俄國青年，便要求和我們握手，因爲他已看出我們招待他的善意，便露出非常惶恐而又感謝的神情，談了一大篇表示抱歉的話。</p>
<p>這個不相識的俄國青年，他會講大英話，法蘭西話，和幾句普通的中國話。據他自己說··他視中國爲第二個祖國，他從前曾在張宗昌部下當過下級軍官。他剛才看見我們的火伴所穿的制服，他不禁想起了從前的舊事。他所以便情不自禁地抱住他，他鄭重聲明，他雖已喝醉了，但却没有一點惡意，他對於中國的青年軍人，一律表示尊敬，剛才他的舉動雖有些魯莽，但也是一種親𤍠的表示。</p>
<p>設到這裏，他望着我們穿制服的火伴說··「你的臉生得眞秀麗！有希臘人的線條，像你這樣年青的人，肯到東北去殺敵人，中國前途是有無限希望的吓！」</p>
<p>喝了幾口咖啡，他愈加興奮起來。我們無心去看吉百色服裝女人的舞姿，也不留神傾聽黑人的音樂，我們都靜聽那個喝醉了的異國青年激昂的獨曰··</p>
<p>「啊！張督辦是中國軍人中一大天才，不差，他是一個武夫，他不懂政治，他不愼主義，但是他是一個男子漢，有丈夫的氣槪。我從前在他部下當軍官時，他待我們眞好，像待他的兄弟一樣。我們有時卽使欠餉兩個月三個月，我們都情願受他指揮，决不有一些怨恨。因爲，大帥一有了錢，他終是幾百元幾十元發下來的。他眞是一個爽快的好漢子！」</p>
<p>「去年，我在中國的報紙上，看見刋着張督辦的照相，朋友告訴我，我才知道他是被剌遇害了。我當塲便流下眼涙來，眞的，告訴你們，我那時候哭了。若使我没有牽累的話，我可以離開上海，我一定去替督辦報仇！」</p>
<p>他說到這裏，眼睛裏放出火般的紅光，我們向他說了幾句安慰的話，大家很隨便地談了許多關於九一八和一二八戰事的話，一直談到半夜，黑眼睛舞塲裏的人物漸漸地多起來了，我們一同走出舞塲。那個異國青年依依不捨地送我們走了一段路。</p>
<p>將别的時候，詩人Ｗ問他··「你爲什麽一個人喝得這樣醉呢？」</p>
<p>「我已經醉了一個多星期，在我辦事的洋行裏請了十天的假日，因爲我失掉了我的愛人，伊已經死了。」</p>
<p>他對我們說這樣最後一句話··「你們需要我的時候，可以到黑眼睛來看我，我把我的生命交給你們了。」</p>

<p>晨開因大連帮條、而爲七百九十八兩五錢、較前收漲起一兩一錢、萬興順利進條、爲九十九兩光景、福餘亦購、好至九兩二錢、匯市開盤、雖與前收平價、至此未見緊臻、且三井華比俱塞正月份二十八元一二五、匯豐雖吃、但總覺較初開時已鬆零六二五、慶發永於八兩半之外售條、物品亦始終售條、蓋物品開盤爲七百九十七兩五錢、而最高亦祇八兩半也、跌至八兩内、萬興仍來購條、仍爲八兩、恒餘乃來脫、苦於無有對手、萬興亦已額滿而退、散户撳價、片刻之間、跌至九十六兩七錢、源茂永來購、爲七兩半光景、小有盤旋、及至匯豐掛牌揭曉英美俱未更動、乃趨和平、盈豐恒進條、加至八兩三錢、二月份美金一二五、華比肯出、恒興遂來售條、乃盤旋而降至八兩内、爲七兩七錢、此時市况平靜、大德成稍進、又至九十八兩一錢、入後匯市亦平、成交俱少、金市從此冷落、自十時十五分以後、卽現收市景况、買賣俱絶踪、間有成交、亦屬零星、敷衍至一小時後、乃見大連帮順利連購小數多次、但恒興適於是際屢來脫售、在八兩光景、互見起仆者久久、銀行此際極賡靜默、塲内大致全由該兩號之少數進出而得以支撑局面、物品雖居於賣方、乃因塲内大户觀望、散户息影、加之物品市塲應手亦屬同病、乃越見無聊、市塲上祇見呌價、而無成交、恒興曾限價來售兩次、俱未得手、最後匯市似有賣户、五月份三七五做過交易、略見回下、至九十七兩一錢、此時已近收市、同行中因有揭價關係、卒以撳者力厚、而以七百九十七兩二錢收盤、（前收七兩四錢）物品續見撳小拍九十六兩八錢、查半日間苟延殘局者頗久、最高價七百九十五兩二錢、最低七百九十六兩七錢、祇有二兩五錢差度、結果較之前收微跌二錢、</p>
<h3>揭價多抑二錢</h3>
<p>揭價因匯豐掛牌美金未更仍計二十七元七五、合標金價八百六十四兩八錢六分、照收盤價言約撳六十七兩六錢、較之前收多撳二錢、正月份登賬與二月份同爲七百九十九兩、三月份七百九十七兩、補水七百九十八兩、</p>
<h3>零星交易點綴</h3>
<p>標面上交易極形平庸、總計大福餘源茂永盈豐恒大德成亦進、恒興福順慶發永恒餘同豐恒以用物品均是賣方、此外則皆零散進出、大連帮萬興軌進一二百條、順利亦買二百餘條、廣帮益豐生大未曾落手、恒興則售出百餘、三月份條額至前日止共計一萬八千零五十三條、</p>
<h3>烚赤祇聞呌價聲</h3>
<p>烚赤昨日較低、初時開價照加十一兩、祇有呌價、而未成交、蓋掉期貼價亦小也、入後做至照加十一兩二錢半、乃見成交、盈豐恒居於買方、而銀樓則爲賣方、成交百餘兩、旋又見十一兩半光景、但祇聞有價而無交易、</p>
<h3>掉期貼價已回跌</h3>
<p>昨市二月份掉三月份貼價已見回跌、初開貼價一兩三錢、（空方貼出）瑞康貼予同豐恒七條、會祥亦貼予同豐恒二十一條、萃昌永貼予盈豐恒七十條、後爲一兩一錢、乃空方昌升永與同豐恒所做、此後又减至貼出一兩、瑞康貼予乾昌祥五十六條、又貼予大德成計九十八條、正月份條額至前日止、祇剩七十條、二月份尙有三千五百二十一條、</p>
<h3>金交休假通告單</h3>
<p>金業交易所昨日揭示、本月二十六日至二十九日、本所休業、三十日起、照常開市、特此通告、</p>
<h3>三言兩語說迴顧</h3>
<p>查本週中狀况複雜、適逢掉期、三月份初開七百九十八兩半、二月份九十九兩七錢、故掉期空方貼出一兩二錢、繼卒爲九十三兩六錢、全週最小之價、翌日陡見八百零四兩高峯、復後盤旋於八百兩内外、最後勞似潛疲、此六天中有十兩零四錢差度、統核比上週六略跌二兩之譜、（約加掉期二兩計算）曁歷年内無大風波矣、</p>
<h3>匯市平庸的局面</h3>
<p>昨日匯市與金市民形清淡、初開英匯出價近期一先令八便十零六二五、蓋倫敦大條近平遠縮零六二五、但英美匯兌長一分、美英匯兌長八四三七五、故與前收平價、美匯近期出價二十八元零六二五、乃因美銀及銀行私電未動、五金交易所遠期銀價漲跌互見、但俱屬小數、美棉雖見微升、亦不在意、故與前收相較亦平、開後一度趨鬆、未幾卽平、蓋匯豐未動、而銀行尙好、最鬆時正月份做二十八元一二五、較之初開硬零六二五、交易極少、與金市同病、金業中極靜、唯泰康潤略扒先令、匯豐結進美金、華比先售後進、但塞多於扒、東洋行家略有抛出、稍孫稍吃先令、此外卽見零蹙、因半日間成交亦未見興奮也、鬆而復平、祇有零六二五差度、結果俱與晨開平價、較之前收亦未見榮辱、茲將半天間銀行進出價錄之如下、</p>
<p>（英匯）開盤近期出價一先令八便士零六二五、華比售予正金三月份一先令八便士一二五、正金則售予沙遜四月份一八七五、華比又塞三月份一二五、乃同行中泰康潤所扒、入後卽未聞成交、延至收盤正月份出價一先令八便士零六二五、二月份同價、三月份一先令八便士一二五、四月份同價、進價爲二五及一八七五、</p>
<p>（美匯）開盤近期出價一先令八便士零六二五、華比售予正金三月份一先令八便士一二五、正金則售予沙遜四月份一八七五、華比又塞三月份一二五、乃同行中泰康潤所扒、入後卽未聞成交、延至收盤正月份出價一先令八便士零六二五、二月份同價、三月份一先令八便士一二五、四月份同價、進價爲二五及一八七五、</p>
<p>（美匯）近期開盤出價二十八元零六二五、開後卽鬆零六二五、三井售予匯豐正月份二十八元一二五、匯豐又吃華比所售正月份一二五、入後稍平、華比售予中孚二月份一二五、華比忽吃正月份一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉美匯未動、仍計二十七元七五、市况乃由鬆趨平、但成交極少、唯聞安達售予麥加利五月份二十八元三七五、收盤出價正月份二十八元令六二五、進價一二五、二月份出價二十八元一二五、進價一八七五、三月份出價二十八元一八七五、進價二五、四月份出價二十八元二五、進價三一二五、美金一圓、合銀仍計三兩六錢零三釐六毫、</p>
<h3>大條銀近縮遠不動</h3>
<p>國民社二十一日倫敦電、大條近期僅縮０六二五、爲十六便士八七五、遠期不動、仍爲十六便士九三七五、又英美匯兌開三元三角五分八七五、</p>
<h3>週末釐拆和緩</h3>
<p>廣角跌而復漲</p>
<p>昨星期六、銀行方面照例下午不做交易、對於銀行收解消息、勢須較平時冷靜、但市塲中釐拆價則依然混亂、就大體觀察、釐價似較前市低墜、實則盤旋之景象、並無何種升降可言、惟輔幣中廣角早市忽然大跌、午市略形回挺、結果較前日小去半分以上、</p>
<h3>洋釐乍上乍下銀拆還是勿動</h3>
<p>「洋釐」昨日早市釐價較前午頓小六毫二忽半、爲七錢一分三釐三毫七忽半、午市相昂二忽半、爲七錢一分三釐六毫二忽产、結果較前午略小三毫七忽半、「銀拆」早午兩市依舊同價、而爲二分、劃頭亦做白劃、觀其銀根趨勢、年内似無升色希冀矣、</p>
<h3>廣角跌漲殊驟銅元續長二千</h3>
<p>江南小洋早市忽高三釐、爲六錢二分七釐、午市又復下墜、計小二釐二毫半、爲六錢二分四釐七毫半、結果較前午反好七毫半、交易早市九千五百角、午市六千角、廣東小洋無故大跌、早市遞小一分零二毫半、爲六錢零三釐、午市略昂五釐半　爲六錢零八釐半、結果較前午小去五釐光景、交易早市十一萬角、午市四萬五千角、銅元賡續放長二千文、爲三百七十八千文、交易四萬零四百四十餘串文、</p>
<h3>銀行半天營業銀欵收解例稀</h3>
<p>昨日銀行收解以半天營業機會、似較平時閑散、華商收解票欵二百四五十萬、外商收解票欵一百七八十萬、墊欵一百餘萬、特欵收解二百五十餘萬、押欵交易一百十餘萬、結欵收解四百餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解五百二三十萬、出倉七十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千八百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百十餘萬、各路匯欵八十餘萬、結束欵二百餘萬、收現五十餘萬、</p>
<h3>洋欵買胃忘懈市塲形勢閑散</h3>
<p>昨日市塲中洋欵交易、外表雖不冷淡、其實純屬對手交易、匯劃票欵早市九十四萬、午市一百十五萬五千、鈔票早市六萬二千、午市五萬、塲外鈔票早市十二萬五千、午市八萬五千、支票交易早市九萬五千、午市二萬、銀行交易早市互市八十萬、午市互市四十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解僅七十餘萬、鈔票進出一百二十餘萬、洋押欵交易九十餘萬、客路來源六十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解九百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百五十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百二十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、</p>
<p>證劵</p>
<h3>舊年關最後一日的債市</h3>
<p>零户有收進之價漲半元至元外</p>
<p>昨債市已爲年節前最後一日之市面、因下星期一須辦理一月份期貨交割、交割後卽暫行停市也、查昨華商證券交易所各債券市况、現貨共僅一萬四千元、内裁兵佔一萬元、其他仍清、期貨一月因準備交割停市、故僅二月期一種市面、上午做開九二餘萬元、下午以價回漲、市亦略暢成交二百三十餘萬元、合計三百廿五萬、内統鹽稅各約六十萬元、餘均祇二三十萬、至各債價之趨勢、前市以求供極平、故上落甚微、後市忽爲零户收進較旺、故價一致回漲、結果比前日多好半元左右、獨一九關現貨比上週漲一元九角、整六期貨亦漲達一元二角云、</p>
<h3>紐約股市先堅後疲</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週五紐約股市、初開漲風頗勁、蓋胡佛與羅司福會晤、空户心虚、紛紛補進、但不久漲勢卽緩、交易亦遂閒散、當會晤結果宣布時、華爾街雖認爲建設的、但覺市况無卽漲之必要、故趨勢愈疲、惟收市價大多數股票均比上日略漲、全日成交數共七十萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<p>假長變化多······還是穏健好</p>
<p>多與空</p>
<p>此日毋須狠命幹</p>
<p>且待節後再角逐</p>
<p>紗市晨間因昶記抛出、市氣帶欽，但市上交易頗清，而外棉亦多變動、且總結賬時期已到、對於營業方面均歸結果、多空兩方須待明春再决雌雄、大半心理觀高、因此多頭過年者較多、然日軍侵略仍烈、究竟如何、須依時局及客需爲伸縮、</p>
<h3>人標</h3>
<p>前市開盤、以美棉疲平、有空頭加碼、各月跌三·四錢、午後一般散户抵補、因明日起有一星期之休假、對於停市之間毫無把握、故軋平交易者較多、各月漲一·二·三·錢、全日成交統計一萬五千八百五十包、查賣出昶記三千二百五十包、愼記一千九百包、穗隆六百五十包、買進吉豐一千四百五十包、信誠七百五十包、泰昌七百包、長豐四百五十包、同興四百包、收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>鄭標</h3>
<p>前市開盤、以美印棉市平平、但一般空散以休假時間甚長、深恐發生變化、了結甚衆、各月漲五分至一錢、午後市氣又軟化、各月跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計二萬三千擔、查賣出信誠一千一百擔、大昶一千二百擔、長豐八百擔、廣豐九百擔、買進吉豐二千四百擔、源興昌一千九百擔、源大九百擔、愼昌四百擔、收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>現棉</h3>

<h3>外棉一致堅靜</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因利物浦消息良好、同業買進、賣户缺乏、市况靜而堅、計期貨漲四至五磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨漲二三點、現貨漲三點、埃及棉現貨跌一點、印棉平淡無特色、計平果爾漲０·二五羅比、奥姆辣涨０·五羅比、白羅溪不動、原電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<h3>救濟案未定前美棉投機受限制</h3>
<p>紐約一月二十日電告一週棉市狀况云、本週原棉市况、大都穏定、因同業及其他方面皆有需求也、價落時之投次收買、殆亦在此需求之中、現貨交易沉寂、但價格基礎尙堅、下届棉田畝數多寡、現尙未有顯明趨勢、說者多謂如農村救濟案、果成事實、而無條文限制棉田畝數、則鄕濃難免增多棉田、據華盛頓消息、參議院或須修正農村救濟案、以支配辦法、用於小麥、而對於棉農則另訂一種救濟辦法、此種事態之不定、使棉市投機事業、受其限制、而棉布與原棉之遠期貿易、亦爲之不振、衆院已通過農産供欵案、規定債額不得超過七千五百萬元、此案現待參院之表决、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>河下米市存厚銷滯</p>
<p>客秈停頓···洋米報漲</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來船寥寥、河存百餘號、高貨已乏、中段貨居多、居胃擇高稍納、致市形又短一二三角不一、薄稻到亦不多、零銷路動、價疲近尺、早稻市疲滯、陰元變元亦趨疲勢、杜尖乏到、客尖稍帶疲勢、羊埠尖短近尺、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨來源僅十餘號、浦積厚、兼之舊年關日近、客家跬躤急脫、幸鄕城店胃購備稍有、棧胃續辦千餘石、市形見軟、蘇同帮及青角薄稻價格站定、僅常帮南港等米步落角許、陰元以供過於求、價落元譜不等、杜洋尖仍以物少獨貴、變元無市、</p>
<p>（客秈）昨日洋客秈市况、竟至完全停頓、客秈閩帮胃口本濃、但以年底大結束之故、均停手不辦、以等明正紅盤再行過問、本街前日似有活動之象、奈昨日河下市面降落、本街囤户均改辦河下粳秈矣、洋米國外市價又見報大、一號西貢須四兩五六錢、小絞大至四兩三四錢、進户亦爲觀望不前、各方均主收束、市面之熱閙、須　到陰歷耕正也、</p>
<h3>麵粉近三月突見上騰</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈平定之態、以洋麥報價雖仍小二三四角不等、惟各廠均觀望、良因年關結束、無意出檔、且以本月份現貨、依然軋缺、業外人心、亦呈昂勢、迨至下午開盤、一二三月份市面突轉高振、本月份均須停拍、過此卽須交割、客帮方面、仍有交易、廠家籌碼、致難補進、外行多頭、扳售甚緊、二三月份因津帮續有收進、形勢甚佳、四月份以次則見平平、因客方未動、廠方亦微有出檔也、至現貨洋麥、聞坎拿大麥、曾成交一　、二月份裝船、價三兩五錢六分、澳麥則未定成、結果本月份較前日漲一分半、二月份漲一分七釐半、三月份漲一分二釐半、四月份漲一釐半、五月份跌二釐半、六月份跌一分云、</p>

<p>昨據洋行消息、謂本麥馬口働行情步步高升、而現貨又覺杯車薪、斷擋之期爲日不遠、所以一般訊息靈通者、莫不向香港菲律濱等處搜羅現貨來申云、</p>

<h3>歧途（一）</h3>
<p>— 悌之</p>
<p>我的同事老周是一個沉默寡言的人，但有時從他那裏却可以得到一句兩句很耐人尋味耐人深思的尖刻話。對於這世界，我也是落落寡合，但對於老周，却很合得來。</p>
<p>有一天下午，郵差來了，這時我正在傳達室盼望朋友的來信。結果，在一大堆信裏，我祇得到兩張賀年片，我是失望了。但在無意中却發現有一封給老周的掛號信，是自浙江海門ＸＸ中學寄發的。當時我很覺稀罕，因爲我知道這位孤僻的周先生，是不常有人和他通信的·，但我拿着兩張賀年片頽然地走出了傳達室後，這無意中發現的奇蹟，也便暫時忘却了。</p>
<p>到了晚上，我坐在書案前感到百無聊賴，隨手拿本史記翻翻，一個字也看不進。不知怎的，我又想到了老周，因而又想到日間發現的那封寄給他的掛號信，我想那信裏一定送來了許多奇蹟，於是，便拖着鞋向他的房间走去，想探聽那稀有的信裏的消息。</p>
<p>我遠遠地看到他坐在那廟似乎是在冥想什麽·，我站在他的門外，看到他的眼皮緊緊地閉着，嘴唇微微地閃着。我不願去打斷他的思潮，偷偷地走進房，坐在他的對面，靜靜地注視着他的態度出神。</p>
<p>他緊閉着的雙眼慢慢地張開了。他看見我坐在對面，也并不覺得一點詫異。他照例請我抽烟，於是我們就對坐着抽起烟來。</p>
<p>『老周！快要散寒假，你下學期還敎書嗎？』我耐不住這死一般的寂靜，很鄭重地向他發問。</p>
<p>「不敎書了。」他說着，同時摇摇頭。</p>
<p>『另有高就吧？我們這敎書的生活也實在不是人的生活啊！』</p>
<p>『那裏談到有什麽高就？你想··我在這裏每週要敎二十一點鐘課，還要兼辦文牘，管理圖書，每日連預備敎課和課外整理共總要做到十二小時以上的工作，我怎能做得下呢？』（未完）</p>
<h3>釋戰爭</h3>
<p>— 鳳舉</p>
<p>「戰爭」，在人類社會中本是一個極不祥的名詞。然而此一名詞，在壓迫者剥削者用之，則爲罪惡·，在被壓迫者被剥削者用之，則爲一種保障生存，興滅繼絶的極神聖莊嚴的行動。</p>
<p>誠然，爲了大衆的和平與幸福，我們是應該反對戰爭，但這應該是單指「罪惡的戰爭」而言。如其戰爭是爲了反抗壓迫，反抗剥削，那便是革命的戰爭，也就是推進時代的動力。爲歷史，爲人類，對於「革命戰爭」，我們不僅是不應該反對，而且應該積極參加。因爲我們認定··只有「革命的戰爭」纔是消滅「罪惡的戰爭」的唯一動力，而且也只有「革命戰爭」纔是被壓迫者被剥削者爭取生存與自由的唯一武器。</p>
<p>我國處於帝國主義者壓迫剥削之下，已經歷時百餘年了。她們在我國普遍地造成農村破産，造成經濟凋敝，造成大衆失業，造成軍閥内戰，造成政治上空前的中世紀的黑暗。特别是日帝國主義者，目前更緊扼我民族之咽喉，欲一舉而制我死命。在這樣的情勢之下，我們還能夠沉迷在虚僞的和平幻夢裏嗎？還能夠以和平的幌子自欺欺人嗎？我們認定··欲致「眞和平」，欲終止「罪惡的戰爭」，在目前，我們只有發動廣泛的「反帝戰爭」｜如果在此時還有人唱維護和平反對戰爭的高調，那便是我們民族戰線裏的内奸，是强盜的說客，也就是被壓迫大衆的敵人！</p>
<p>所以，在當前，每一個被壓迫者應該認清「戰爭」的眞實意義，每一個被壓迫者尤其應該握緊「革命戰爭」這唯一的武器！</p>
<h3>病態（一）</h3>

<p>｜小市民生活的又一面｜</p>
<p>「我們中國即使樣樣不如人家，這菜肴一項，總不算壞吧！在冬天，我說，中菜更其比西菜來得適宜。」在談話停止片時後，磊望着羅列在面前熱氣騰騰的菜肴，又開始向他的朋友坊和桐說話了。同時，他把酒壺中的殘酒，斟滿在自己杯内··然後，對着正送上一道菜來的侍者，朗朗地吩咐··「燙酒！」「中菜眞不算差！我也愛吃。」坊接上去說··「老學究們說··中國人太崇拜歐美了，尤其是青年，樣樣都是别人家的好。其實，他們的話，也未免太武斷了·，我們愛中國菜，難道不好說是國粹的愛護者嗎？」他說着，笑了。</p>
<p>「厚臉！照你這樣說法，你簡直還可以把自己說成盡忠報國的志士咧！」桐帶着一半莊嚴一半滑稽的神態。忽然他的聲音漸漸地憤激起來了··「喂，你們近來也注意國事嗎？中國應該自己振作起來！中國應該勇敢地作戰！······好，酒來了，給我！」這時侍者正送進酒來，他接着酒壺，往自己杯子裏斟。</p>
<p>一只胡琴的吚呀聲，從别一房間中傳來。接着有一個低微糢糊的女子聲音在唱。磊和坊顯然凝神地在聽。桐向着他們哼地一聲冷笑。</p>
<p>「聽他嗎的蚊子般的呌！來，我們喝酒，乾這一杯，爲中國前途祝福，爲英勇的健兒們祝勝利」！桐說着，舉起酒杯，咕咕地喝。一杯酒，一口氣喝完了</p>
<p>「唉，你爲什麽不去投軍呢！」磊冷酷地說。</p>
<p>「我！我老桐嗎？我不是没有熱血！我不是没有勇氣！可是環境實在糟，他媽的，糟透了環，境不容我去投軍。但我要和環境奮鬭！我要投軍去！去，去！到東北去！」桐說着，拳頭猛地擊一下桌子，然後拿起筷來，夾一筷菜，送進嘴裏，有勁地咀嚼着。</p>
<p>磊望着桐越來越紅的臉，自言自語··「不中用！經不得幾杯酒，臉早已通紅，還要吹牛，發酒瘋！」</p>
<p>「什麽？」桐忽的眼珠突了出來，怒氣冲冲地問。同時，不知不覺地，手把袖子一擅。</p>
<p>「不要閙！說起投軍，我倒有一個消息告訴你們。」坊的話横梗進來，「你們知道嗎？老姜要北上投軍去了。你們想，這可能嗎？」（未完）</p>
<h3>蘇聯婦女的解放</h3>

<p>你要像男子一樣去工作，一樣自食其力，一樣獻身於新社會的建立。在那裏，兩性是絶對平等的。假使你努力的話，你儘可參加任何種的職業，做任何種的工作。即使你去做那最粗重的最不舒服的男子底勞動，也决没有人會因你是女子而譏笑你。</p>
<p>你可以做泥水匠，木匠，清道婦，集産農塲的幹事，你也可以做鎔鐵爐原料管理員，或是引重機掣動者，或是屠夫，或是政府最着重的電氣部部長。</p>
<p>現已告落成的第聶伯大水閘是曾經許多婦女勞動共同築成的。她們也是「五年計劃四年完成」之一大動力。</p>

<p>在蘇聯，每個女子都注重自己的人格價值。做共産黨要人的妻，並不因而格外光榮。</p>
<p>新聞記者没有像在美國訪見胡佛夫人柯立芝女士那樣在俄國訪見斯大林夫人。（斯大林夫人曾研究化學工程，預備到人造絲廠裏去。）</p>
<p>蘇俄實在没有弱不勝衣的婦女。在合作塲附近的水泥建築物上，常是完全用女工。她們造牆，她們鋪地板，打窗户，裝鉛管。</p>
<p>許許多多新成的水門汀路，都出自婦女的手。在新建築中的房屋的四五層樓上面可看見女砌磚匠。</p>
<p>這種平等當然普及到各方面。蘇聯的男子們學會了帮同她們料理家務，帮同她們領小孩子到公園·，男子們也得買小菜。</p>

<p>但是，像這樣的脫軌的感情，如果一天一天的深進下去，將來，如何地去收拾呢？這是罪惡！這是莫在的罪惡！自己是有爲的青年。自己是中華民國的未來的主翁。自己要立志做一個模範的青年！自己要保持純㵖的人格！</p>
<p>但是他的胸口仍然在砰砰地跳動。他此刻的心理好像一個竊盜，看定了一個對象物，正在準備着手攫取。</p>
<p>「攬着她要求一個Ｋ······iss，······」</p>
<p>他知道，這是比俯拾一下東西還要容易。但是他想，何以自己的情感竟這樣地在激動不敢立卽出之于行動呢？他感着自己的週身起了一陣冷抖。他望了望前頭的車夫。車夫貝是在熱心地運轉把手，並没有閒心思注意坐在他後面的他俩。他再看了車外的兩側有没有人注意坐在車裏面的他和她。</p>
<p>「眞笨！誰會看我們呢？在路上來往的人，各有各的車體。縱令望見我俩的車裏接吻，誰會管閒事上來干涉呢？並且又不認識我們是誰。汽車也駛得這樣快，在外面一定看不清楚的。······吻她吧，吻她吧」‘</p>

<h3>「報國有心救危無力」的民氣</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>日前記者在京，見到一位適從北平來的朋友，我們趕忙請他將平津當局的抗日情形與一班民氣的表現見告。這位朋友不由立刻用一種哭喪的面孔，望着我們說了以下的一番話··</p>
<p>『我在路上就知遇到你們時，要問我這兩句話，因爲這也是我常想而最注意的兩個問題。但是愈注意，就愈要令人失望！論到那位守土的長官，自榆關九門口相繼不守以來，遣兵調將，雖有决心抵抗的表示，然而仍僱重於守的方面，似乎還談不到反攻失地的準備。若是像這樣一處被攻，就在一處抵抗，不守則後退，通電全國宣告不守的原因，並誓言旦旦，將如何抗敵的决心，但結果仍是按兵不動，而不作反攻失地的準備，不覺令我們想到這祇有退與守的「抵抗」二字的妙用了。至於民衆方面所表現的，除了有錢的搬家，學校放假學生四散，平民日坐愁城，憂慮將來没有飯吃而外，則仍是充滿了和平的空氣，極少抗日的組織或其他激昂的表示。清華大學學生在要求學校當局提前放假免除大考的呈文中有「報國有心救危無力」的兩句話！吾人從這兩句話上觀察，或能領會到平津民意的所在，與毫無表示的原因了罷！』</p>
<p>我們聽了這位朋友的話，有一點地令人驚心動魄而最值得注意的，不是那可以代表大多數國人心理的「報國有心救危無力」的兩句無可奈何，極端與喪氣的話了！我們對於華北當局的不能反守爲攻積極抵抗的態度，本爲意中事，我們看二十日下午（見本報北平專電）張學良在順承王府招待各界的演說中曾有『對外作戰，必須全國總動員，始可收效」、的議論。我們站在國民的立塲，深覺中央在日軍攻佔榆關後，一方面宣言在華北準備竭力抵抗，而一方面在長江各處則仍維持友誼態度，這種國際間空前未有的滑稽外交政策，本屬使人大惑不解，以致令那位本來無抵抗精神的張先生没有勇氣作孤軍的奮鬭，則亦爲我們老百姓所能諒解的事實。至於有人希望張學良不顧一切，效法過去十九路軍在上海抗日的精神，那又是國人一種根本錯誤的僥倖觀念，不認識張學良的奢望罷了。但我們對於民氣的表現的方面，却有鄭重提出來討論的必要。</p>
<p>我們深覺此次平津的民氣如此不振，有兩種原因··第一是由於一年來華北當局對民衆抗日運動非獨不能保護提倡，反施行種種壓迫手段，以免日人藉口生事的機會，以致大多數素性怯弱的民衆，日淪於消沉苟安的一途，遂養成所謂「報國有心救危無力」的結果·，第二是由於民衆組織的不健全，因此雖有民氣而無民力，一遇壓迫，就更容易頽廢消沉，而况卑怯苟安，缺乏反抗的精神，又本爲國人千百年來在專制制度下所養成的一種通病。所以我們要挽救當前的大難，不要徒然注意民衆的激發，尤應注意民力的培養。培養民力的入手法，就是使民衆有組織的訓練。有了健全的民衆組織，就有偉大的民衆力量。我們相信凡有血氣的人，在今日外患如此緊迫，而全國上下仍然如此死氣沉沉的現狀下，没有人不痛心疾首，而感到「報國有心，救危無力」的苦悶。所以記者對於清華學生要求提前放假，停止大考，雖不敢有所恭維·，但是對於「報國有心，救危無力」的這兩句話，却表示相當的同情，實在不忍加以責備。因爲這倒實在是兩句老實話，比較表面上唱抵抗的高調而實際上仍是不戰不和，决不反攻的政府當局要高明得多了。</p>
<p>不過中國是我們大多數人的家鄕，我們却不能因爲有心無力就可以將這亡國的責任推到政府的一二人身上去，就算完事的。我們應覺悟國家之所以到了這步内亂不息外患不已的田地，根本的原因就是由於我們做國民的放棄責任，我們民衆的毫無組織，因此我們没有一點力量來外抗强敵，内除國賊，這是我們所應該及時猛省，努力補救的問題。</p>
<p>問題討論</p>
<h3>三種不同的人物</h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>｜店員店主與顧客｜</p>
<p>店員慢客問題</p>
<p>本刋對於「店員怠慢顧客」的問題，連續的討論了不少，然而都偏重於店員方面而忽視了顧客方面。我雖不是個店員，但是我認爲兩方面都應該相提並論的。</p>
<p>店員的所以怠慢顧客，已由游萍祥鼎警愚諸君在前幾期裏，都說得很明白，透澈，總括一句話，就是因爲店員智識淺薄，輕貧崇富，染受惡習所致。其實就他們的本身而言，的確也有很多的痛苦，譬如店主的待遇低劣，工作時間過長，環境不良，生活不安，在在足以養成他們對於工作上的掃興，乏味，苦悶，在此種狀態之下，欲使其增進工作的效率，確乎是很難的。</p>
<p>固然，店員往往要怠慢顧客，但有時這也是顧客方面自取其辱。往往有一種顧客在未踏進店門之前，毫不思索或考慮他所要購的是何等貨物，旣進之後，又全無目標的東看西望，甚至一再揀選而毫無主見。或則於貨物揀定之後，包紮完畢而付欵時，硬讓物價，低减銀錢，以致交易不成，出言不遜。因此種種而引起店員的慢客心理，這也是常見之事。</p>
<p>综於上述情形，吾的結論是·，欲改變店員這種慢客的態度，在店主方面須貨物眞實，價格公道，改良店員待遇，使其安心服務，並予以相當時間的閱書看報的機會，俾得提高學識，增進道德·，顧客方面，須抱誠篤的態度，謙抑爲懷，不要一味以顧客自居而輕視一切·，店員方面，也應平心靜氣，勿苟且，毋咆噪，堅持服務社會的精神，勿以個人的喜怒而加之顧客。以上種種，亦是商業塲中應有的一種道德呢！</p>
<p>工商界生活</p>
<h3>虚驚報販生活</h3>
<p>— 英惠</p>
<p>滬戰的時候，我在楊樹浦一帶偷偷摸摸的賣了五天報，生意眞不錯，老申報每份可賣到一角大洋，時報一百五十文，賺出吃飯錢之外，還有些存頭。雖然每天很疲勞，又吃驚受嚇，但爲了生活，也只有憑運氣盡力去幹罷了。</p>
<p>這些報都是偷偷地從望平街批來的，販賣的時候每次身上最多只帶五份，太多了，身上藏不下，讓東洋兵看到那就完了。街口上，時常發現平端着鎗的東洋兵，可是我過了五天，熟習了工作，恐怖的心早没有了。有時我還故意從東洋兵身前走過，裝做没事的樣子。</p>
<p>賣完五份，就回到家中，再拿五份，一次一次一直到賣完。小金子我們兩個起先每天可賣去三十份，後來添到五十份。看的人越多，我們賺錢越多，而遭逢危險的機會也就越多。我們常常聽人家說着下面的話·，</p>
<p>「八道頭一個報販子讓東洋兵打死了。」</p>
<p>[四個賣報人被捉到東洋兵營房去了　。</p>
<p>「東洋人一看到賣中國報的人就把他槍斃！」</p>
<p>我們起初聽了有些恐懼，可是一經幹熟了這事情，却並不把這些事放在眼睛裏，還是照樣偷偷的，一家一家的送，賣。</p>
<p>「外，」送報到某一個弄堂裏，常常聽到有人輕輕的喊，我就知道又有生意來了。那人就該再低聲的發問·，「報還有麽？前線怎樣？」</p>
<p>這情形下我顧不得多說話，一面答應着「有」，一面說着「東洋兵吃了大敗仗」的話，遞過一份報，收了錢，就走過去。這時候馬路上巡捕很少見，可是要是見到，他們總是帮忙的，不像平常對待小販子們那樣凶，我想，這也許是因爲他們已從這次滬戰中認識了帝國主義凶惡的面目的緣故罷。</p>
<p>想到五天工夫賣報能賣到兩百多份，就是作夢也想不到。要不是死死活活緊跟緊，生意眞是更要好些，只是怕不知怎樣死，死到什麽地方，或是什麽時候死。這眞是個問題。</p>
<p>我眞是不平，中國人爲什麽要受外國人欺侮？中國的地方，讓外國人佔去了，算是租界，讓東洋人來打中國人，</p>
<p>（尙有重要文字轉入第二版）</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>這可是什麽一回事？况且楊樹浦一帶，也不是日本人地方，幹什麽要他們派兵站崗，壓制中國人？要不是這樣，賣起報來不是很方便麽？</p>
<p>「打倒帝國主義，定要打倒帝國主義！」由許多方面所受到的剌激與苦痛，我是這樣的憤恨，這樣的下着决心。所以，在報上看到有些人參加義勇軍在閘北打東洋兵，我自己也想過好幾回要去作個勇士，去殺敵，爲弱小民族謀解放，爲勞苦大衆作反帝國主義的戰爭。這是多麽偉大的一件事呀！不是比我在楊樹浦一帶偷偷摸摸賣報好得多麽？可是，到後我還是不去了，我的原因是··作反帝國主義的戰爭，爲弱小民族爭生存，並不只是上前線的仗一件事，我能在後方多賣幾份報，使同胞們能在嚴重監視下可以看到報紙，可以知道戰况，可以激發起反帝抗日的决心，·····這不也是一件很重要的工作麽？我確有繼續賣報的必要！就算我將來難免爲賣報犧牲，那也是值得的。</p>
<p>這天剛過午，我腰裏藏着五份報紙，一面走路，一面吃着大餅。按每天送報次序，我先到如意里，轉到宏元里，當我走出宏元里口，剛想把最後一份送給弄口旁一家烟紙店時，我聽到身後有粗暴的喊聲··「站下！」</p>
<p>起先我還未留意，到後聽到槍機聲，我回頭一看，才知道是什麽一回事。原來後面華德路上三個東洋兵正在端着槍喊我。這回我眞慌了，怎麽辦呢？要是讓這三只狗捉去，那一定不會好了。我不能再想，那三個東洋兵往前走來了。什麽也不管，死死活活，任憑這一回，我一彎身，竄到路旁，正好這裏靠着個小菜塲，還有些人往來。我鑽進人羣中，三脚兩步奔進一家過街豆腐店，從後門逃了出去。隨後我聽到「拍」「拍」響了兩鎗。自然是打我的了，可是我終於逃到另外的一條馬路上。</p>
<p>一份報紙，早不知失落在什麽地方，也許會讓那三個東洋兵拾到了也未可知，但這算什麽，把一條命逃出來，不是比什麽都好麽？隨後我拐灣抹角繞了好多路，總算又回到三層閣樓的家裏。</p>
<p>我的心跳的很厲害，把從前想過的一切都抛出腦袋之外，現在唯一支配我的就是一個「怕」。眞的，我怕，我怕東洋兵追到我這三層閣，我怕被捉，我怕鎗斃！我的處境是何等的危險！······我看那放在地板上的時報，報上大紅字一會兒就變成鮮紅的一堆血，報紙上的黑字跳了起來，房子裏的破亂東西，也隨之閃動了！到後連小閣樓都似乎旋轉了起來，······</p>
<p>忽然，門開了，我睜大眼睛一看，是小金子。「怎不去賣，藏在房裏做什麽？」他問我。這一下子，我的頭腦清醒些了，但我回答他些什麽？說不出。</p>
<p>「怎麽回事？你傻了？」</p>
<p>我這回完全恢復了原狀，所有變動都没有了。我就小聲的把遇到的事情對他說了一遍，說完我還問他，是不是看到有東洋兵在門口走的話，我仍是充滿着恐怖的心情。</p>
<p>「是不是小菜塲一拐角地方？」他問我·，「這樣一回事就把你嚇到這樣，看你的臉色活像白紙！告訴你說，打鎗時候我正在小菜塲南邊，可是我没有跑，我還站在那裏看好久呢。東洋兵後來不知怎樣看到一張時報，就搜查起人。原來那就是你丢掉的時報，罰你少吃一頓大餅。」他說到這裏笑了一笑。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3>爲職業界青年向社會請命</h3>
<p>— 靄英</p>
<p>職業界青年在服務上所得的敎訓，第一個是學問淺薄，不敷應用，十個中倒有九個想利用業餘，補充學問。一般雇主對此問題的態度，可分三種··第一種人以爲店員祇可使由之，不可使知之。一朝知之，便是禍水，無論如何，極力反對他們讀書。有時青年店員自動進職業補習學校，一經覺察，便認爲天大的悖謬行爲，立刻提出警告，如再讀書，惟有解雇，青年店員爲了衣食計，只好屈服。第二種人以店員讀書是店員自身的事，只要與服務没有妨碍，任他去進學校。第三種人以爲店員讀書雖是店員自身的事，但是店員學問增進後，服務效率，自然提高，與商店不無關係，很慷慨的拿出學費來。就上海論，第一種人還是多數，第二種人只有新式商店，并且也不是全體，第三種人只有文化機關和金融機關的一部分，那眞是是鳳毛麟角了。因此，職業界青年要讀書而不得的人，也不知有多少，智識飢荒的呼聲，徧於全市，我爲良心所驅使，不得不爲他們向社會請命。</p>
<p>第一奉勸雇主不要阻止青年店員求學，埋没他們的前程，同時阻止你店務的發展。因爲現在是商戰時代，店員學問淺薄，服務效率低微，决不能獲得勝利。最好大家像文化機關，金融機關一樣，送你　們的青年店員入學。</p>
<p>第二奉勸社會上𤍠心救國的人士，用一大部分的精神和實力來提倡和贊助職業補習敎育，使一班已經覺悟的青年店員，得到良好的充分的敎育，做你們救國工作的一枝生力軍。</p>
<p>第三奉勸社會一致督促政府拿出一筆經費來，推行職業補習敎育，同時把初級職業補習敎育列入義務敎育，强迫雇主送其青年店員入學。</p>
<p>第四奉勸辦敎育的人們，少辦些空洞的大學和中學，大家來與職業界切實聯絡，辦理最有效能的職業補習敎育。</p>
<p>啊，大家聳着耳朶，聽那職業界青年智識饑荒的悲慘呼聲，伸出手來援救他們吧！</p>

<p>— 梁道弘</p>
<p>「喂，許久不見，你現在榮任何處啊？」周在××路上遇見我時這樣的問着。</p>
<p>「華租兩界的量地官。」我答。</p>
<p>「量地官？什麽？」周很詫異的問。</p>
<p>「量地官這名詞不是我新創造的，這是一般失業同志唯一避債的方法。我失業已經快一年了，家中衣食住都發生問題，坐在家裏，愁苦非常，倒不如出來量量地皮」。我解釋着。</p>
<p>「量地皮終非久計，你爲什麽不想個法子呢？」</p>
<p>「我没有大脚力，雖曾向親友們請託過好幾次，但他們祇是言語支吾，報上的聘請欄，又是靠不住，還有什麽辦法啊？」</p>
<p>「哦！你不知道嗎？現在有一位姓申名報六十多歲的老太婆開了一所薦頭行，聞很有成績，何不去試試看？」</p>
<p>「原來如此，我馬上去試試看。再會！再會！」</p>
<p>「再會！再會！」</p>
<p>那天下午，那家薦頭行裏來了一個年約二十歲的人。據他自己說··他是粤人，能通滬語，擅長英文，新式簿記，英文打字，商業算術，略識珠算。前曾在××洋行服務，後因滬戰停職。如有公司或洋行，願任用他的，不論任何位置，均所歡迎。月薪三十元左右。通信處··本刋轉。</p>

<p>自去年「一二八」事變後，我執業的那爿洋貨號，當然也不能例外，店主於是借題發揮，宣佈取消公記花紅等等店員的利益，起初各夥友鑒於店中虧本，並未表示反抗，以全同舟共濟之誼·目下大結束期將届，全部貨帳，雖尙不能結清，但大略已可槪見，敝號本年營業，非但不致虧本，並且還有若干盈餘，我們一般店員，於是向店主要求恢復原有各種利益，那知店主方面，竟置若岡聞，豈不是明明來剥削我們嗎？</p>
<p>編者先生！這件事該怎樣對付？請你從速指示·（下略）　　潘少安</p>
<p>編者按··公記爲店主因體恤店員起見，特指定店内某種非主要的收入，爲各夥友所有，不論全店盈虧如何，此種業經指定的收入，每年必分給各夥友，論其性質，完全爲店主的一種贈與，所以在向例没有公記的商店裏，店員們是不能提出要求的··理由是因爲法律上規定「贈與」是一種「放任行爲」的緣故，但是一向有這例規的商店裏，店主却也不能片面宣佈取消，因爲事實上，爲了這種公記的收入，各夥友的薪水，已經酌量减低，而且習慣在民法上也有巨大勢力的。</p>
<p>再按花紅的性質，是在營業盈餘項下，提出幾分之幾，分給夥友，作爲辛苦一年的酬勞，普通都明確規定在議單之内，所以店如虧本則已，倘有盈餘，此項花紅是絶對不容剥奪的，</p>
<p>根據上面的論斷，那末潘君的同事們，當據理力爭，不容放棄，但是我們知道今年上海銀根奇緊，間有許多商店，帳簿上雖是賺錢，但實際上却又非常拮据，希望潘君等再實地調查一下，看有没有這種情形，如其有之，那末在據理力爭之外，不妨作延遲支取的讓步，能顧念「同舟共濟」的潘君等，諒亦以爲然也。</p>

<h3>電影與文學趣味</h3>
<p>— 黃震遐</p>
<p>以下的祇是些個人在電影院裏所得到的觀感，每段都是隨筆寫成，因爲並非嚴肅的批評，所以也顧不到時間性他種批評文章的限制，亦非片片都寫，個人看過以爲好的，感動過的，便隨筆紀錄下來，一切都是很自由，但却負責任。</p>
<h3>㈠最後之中隊</h3>
<p>古戰塲的寫照，伙伴精神的結晶，抵抗的力量達到白𤍠點。�</p>
<p>全片日爾曼化得很厲害，然而這種日爾曼化却不是近代而是古舊的，歷史的，舉凡近代日爾曼人所講究的清潔，秩序，科學化，在片中都見不到，然其鬰勃沉毅的精神，以及北歐人所特有的悲哀與紀律化，却是始終都努力地表現着。丨丨故事的時代是一八零六年，正當拿破崙大軍掃蕩普魯士之際，在十九世紀的歷史上，我們曾讀過那時普魯士國土在野納一戰裏，是怎樣絶望地没没，正像我們九一八前後的東北一樣。這故事所描寫的，便是激昂地叙述出日爾曼人所引爲奇恥大辱的那個時代，而全片的結晶點，就以野納慘敗後普軍一位下級官和他十二名士兵百折不撓，血戰至死的一首史詩作爲歸結。其中尙配以村女多拉所引起一些很暫的柔和的情緒，以及戰友們親愛精誠從生到死的悲壯經過。</p>
<p>總而言之，這影片所啟示的意義，就是軍人的服從與死，其中並無什麽國家民族大衆的大道理存在，一切都是紀律，紀律的力量，紀律至死！所以，片中人物，最高的就是一個上尉連長（中隊長），而在接觸的時候，連的人數却早已减低至戰關最小單位的班（十二人）。結果祇見法軍轉長脫帽向血肉模糊的敵屍嚴肅致其軍人的敬禮，同時哀悼死者的音波徐徐升起，幕落。</p>
<p>勞萊與哈台合演長片「喜緊門」LaurelandHardyinPackUpYourTroubles中之一幕</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評莫負今宵</h3>
<p>— 蔣青</p>
<p>「莫負今宵」一片是在國泰戲院開映的。</p>
<p>這片的内容情節，大致講一個歌女追求她所慕的男性，起初被拒絶，後來竟能成功。所以全劇的特點，以𤍠烈的表情和繁閙的情節見長，可稱爲一浪漫喜劇。</p>
<p>主角便是以風騷見稱的史璜生，表演可算是已臻化境，動作却嫌有些過火。劇情的關連有幾處不大佳妙，似爲情理中所不合。導演的手腕很好，攝影的光線角度尤爲精妙，使人覺得很有美化。幾個配角也是很好的所以能賓主相得益彰。</p>
<p>總之，這片子是很值得一看的。</p>
<h3>評龍翔鳳舞</h3>
<p>— 警吾</p>
<p>稱爲烏發之轟天第一砲的「龍翔鳳舞」，終於前天在南京大戲院和我們相見了。</p>
<p>龍翔鳳舞的故事，當一八一四年，拿破侖失敗，被放於埃爾巴島，於是全歐的國王及政治家，均興高彩烈地在維也納地方舉行慶祝大會。俄皇亞力山大就在這時候，結識該地美女克麗絲特兒。在第一次所謂「會議跳舞大會」中，各人正在歡樂的時候，忽報拿破侖已由法登陸，於是各人均怱怱散去，一塲歡夢，遂成泡影。</p>
<p>故事極平凡，但是在技巧上說，這片確是成功之作。麗琳哈蕙飾克麗絲特兒，表演活潑可愛。在赴俄皇新居和在馬車上所唱的那首歌曲，是多麽的動人心弦！眞不愧爲歐洲的影后，亨利加拉飾俄皇亞力山大，表演風流，使人滿意，麗爾丹哥娃的貴族婦女，和假皇帝吊膀子的一幕，眞是好到極點，其餘的配角也很能稱職，光線很適合，並白也還流利。滑稽穿挿都能使人滿意，不過在會議跳舞大會時，俄皇和克麗跳舞的一幕，實在太長而且複雜。其餘都很好。</p>
<p>總之，這片在烏發上說，確實可稱得上一聲「傑作」。</p>
<h3>「龍翔鳳舞」</h3>
<p>— 因</p>
<p>（上略）該片的導演是很聰明的，鐘頭也擇得靈活動人，像奥國親王美突尼琪在會議完結後宣讀議决案的時候的一個鐘頭，是表露得非常深刻和美麗。其他如克麗絲特兒，從一家店裏被接到俄皇的别墅去的時候，這個鐘頭的拖長，起碼在千尺以上，但它一點也没有呆板的毛病。這種新頴的鐘頭，在美國片中是很少見到的。</p>
<p>至於演員方面，以麗琳哈蕙的克麗絲特兒和康勒維特的美突尼琪爲最佳，其他的都極能稱職，可以讓我們稱讚一聲好。</p>
<p>還有一點，在最後的收塲。當外面報告拿破崙已經在法國登陸的時候，𤍠閙喜樂的會塲中秩序大亂，國王政治家各自四散，俄皇也怱忙首途，遺棄了克麗絲特兒，這種風調，原是德國片的特色，我覺得這樣收塲，也是導演者高明的地方。</p>
<h3>湯密克土脫離環球</h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>著名武俠明星湯密克士LomMix已决定完全脫離電影界，本來在他與環球影片公司所定合同上，註明他在環球公司應當演六部影片，現在他祇演了三部，尙有三部是不演了。而環球公司對于他的脫離的原因是很諒解的。</p>
<p>湯密克士最近宣稱，環境與種種情形使他不得不告退休養，他將帶了他的夫人，補行他倆遷延至今的蜜月旅行，在歐洲小住之後，他俩還想周遊世界。</p>
<p>湯密克士在電影界已有二十四年的歷史，演過三百七十四部影片，他在製片時，曾遭遇到二十五次跌打骨碎，以及數不數次的創傷。他的名馬「湯納」亦將同時脫離銀幕。</p>
<p>我們對于這位影壇上亨過盛名，資望最老的「老湯」和名馬的退休，應當怎樣的抱憾着，敬祝着他們的康健啊！</p>
<h3>忘記了的小姑娘回來了傑克</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>六七年前洛山機一家戲院的舞臺上，有一個十六歲舞女表現色藝，引起了卓别靈的注意。就與這嬌小無名　愛爾蘭女郎訂了合同，請她在「馬戲」滑稽片裏擔任要角。第二天她的芳名美娜甘納第MernaKennedy就在好萊塢鵲噪起來。</p>
<p>美娜甘納第以前並没有上過鏡頭連製片塲也没到過，她居旬得同銀幕上最偉大的藝術家做重要的配角，那眞是一件新聞。</p>
<p>遐邇傳聞的卓别靈影片着手攝製了，美娜甘納第的芳名就如野火般的夢延開去。「馬戲」滑稽片攝製纔及半部，卓别靈的夫人梨泰葛萊就提起離婚訴訟。這張片子遂暫時擱置，以等好萊塢人人注意的離婚案的審訊，這件離婚案本來與美娜甘娜第絶無關係，不過報紙爲要新聞起見。就硬把美娜捲入漩渦丨丨這十六歲的小姑娘，素爲卓别靈以小孩看待的，又成爲新聞記者的好資料了。</p>
<p>「馬戲」滑稽片的製成，居然成爲這位没有經騐的紅髪小舞女的一大傑作。她的成績得着了美國評戲家的一致贊美。然而好萊塢却對她嫉視了。她的色藝在銀幕上曇花一現之後，因之就此没没無聞了。</p>
<p>好萊塢似乎决計把她忘了，但是美娜甘娜第是忘記不了的。雷米爾在把舞臺名戲「百老匯」攝製爲影片的時候，他就擯棄了一大串有地位的明星，而挑選她擔任該片的女主角。於是好萊塢又給她震動了，其時她已二十歲，暗中又遇着了敵人，因之她决計非遇着她所心願的機會，她决定不幹。從此她又没没無聞者兩年之久。</p>
<p>美娜甘娜第深深地覺得，二次再起已大不易，三次再起似乎無此魄力。但是她不露聲色地，現在又擠入好萊塢明星的前列，她三次再起的第一片是LadywithaPast她在好萊塢先後六年，現方二十三歲，比到從前更美麗了。</p>

<p>據他所說·，狐狸公司裏的導演先生，提拔他充任着片中主要的角色後，使他能夠把所有的天才或抱負，盡量的發展。這一點是要深深地感謝他們的。但是法雷的時間，被他們支配得太經濟了，以致他得不到充分的時間，來醫治他的「鼻疾」，這雖是一種小恙，可是他覺得爲普通的健康起見，總要施行手術後，才爲妥善。</p>

<p>The Politico-Legal Committee of the Nineteen Nations Issues an Ultimatum to Tokyo</p>
<p>Accept or reject the draft proposal within 24 hours</p>
<p>The Japanese government stubbornly refuses to the end, ignoring it</p>
<p>On the one hand, it plans to propose a counter-proposal to avoid taking responsibility for a breakdown.</p>
<p>Mediation in the Sino-Japanese case has apparently failed; drafting of a report begins</p>

<p>Advocating that the Mediation Committee be directly responsible to the League of Nations General Assembly</p>
<p>Reiterating the two key points of abolishing the puppet state of Manchukuo and inviting the US and Russia to cooperate</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen Nations held a meeting tonight. Because the Japanese response was difficult to accept and mediation was impossible, it was decided to immediately begin drafting a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant, to be submitted for discussion next Monday. However, during the drafting of the report, efforts will still be made to mediate if any possibility is found. (Central News Agency dispatch from 7:21 PM on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, the Committee of Nineteen postponed the meeting from the 20th until 5 PM on the 21st because the Japanese response had not arrived. Mediation seems to be hopeless. After Simon returns to Geneva early next week, the chaotic situation will surely be clarified. Will the League of Nations, by constantly accommodating Japan, be able to find a way to mediate in the hopeless situation, or will it draft a report based on Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant? A decision will be made at this time. As for our country's attitude, it has always adhered to a tough policy, and we will reject anything that is not in our interests, regardless of the form it takes. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen met this afternoon and decided to issue a document to Japan that was in the nature of an ultimatum, giving it 24 hours to accept or reject the proposal of January 18, that is, after withdrawing the proposal to invite the United States and Russia to participate in the mediation, Japan should accept the remaining items and explanatory memorandum of the draft proposal of December 20. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Committee of Nineteen asked the Japanese government to give a clear answer to its proposal of Wednesday. The Japanese government ignored it and today telegraphed its representative in Geneva to accept the "Drummond Plan" and delete the article inviting non-member states. The Japanese Foreign Ministry hopes that this approach can be accepted, but it hinted that if the Committee insists on the proposal of January 18, Japan will have to answer with a "no." (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation has received instructions from Tokyo and is scheduled to meet this morning to consider the reply to be sent to Chairman Hymans of the Committee. It is generally expected that the Japanese representative's reply will be in the nature of proposing a counter-proposal, indicating Japan's desire to avoid a breakdown and its unwillingness to abandon mediation procedures. How the Committee of Nineteen will respond to this kind of answer from the Japanese side is a matter of much speculation. However, it must be acknowledged that repeated delays and endless discussions are gradually causing an unbearable atmosphere of tension. Even the major powers now agree that there should be no more delays and that the second step should be taken. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The instructions expected by the Japanese delegation have now arrived. The Japanese government has put forward a counter-proposal to the precise questions raised by the Committee of Nineteen, which shows that Japan does not want the negotiations to break down. The Committee of Nineteen will meet at 4 PM this afternoon to formally receive the Japanese counter-proposal. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, League of Nations General Assembly President Meng told reporters that since receiving the two replies from Japan, the situation has become slightly simpler, but he refused to explain clearly the tendency for the situation to simplify, nor did he want to give the impression that the Committee of Nineteen's mediation had failed. According to reports, after the two telegrams from Tokyo arrived at the Japanese delegation this morning, Matsuoka immediately forwarded them to Hymans and Secretary-General Drummond. The first telegram was a reply to the proposal of the Committee of Nineteen on Wednesday, and the second telegram fully approved the counter-proposal sent by the Japanese representative to the Committee of Nineteen on Friday. It is reported that this counter-proposal has not yet been considered by the Committee. At present, people in the League of Nations who are well-informed are concerned that if Tokyo's reply to the proposal of the Committee of Nineteen is in a negative tone, then it is almost certain that the Committee of Nineteen will decide to move Article 15, Paragraph 4 today at noon. If the Committee of Nineteen proceeds to invoke Paragraph 4, it is expected that it will first elect a subcommittee to consider the various drafts, and finally submit them to the Committee of Nineteen for discussion. The British delegation now advocates that the report should 1) adopt the Lytton Report, and 2) make a clear statement that the League of Nations member states cannot recognize the establishment of an independent state of Manchuria, so that the report includes the latest facts. At present, it seems that many people agree with this British proposition, but the British side also said that the Lytton Report is somewhat outdated, because the recent Sino-Japanese conflicts, including the Yuguan incident, all occurred after the investigation team left the Far East. However, it is recognized that the League of Nations General Assembly cannot express its position on these incidents because it has not received reliable and impartial reports. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Declaration of Our Delegation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations issued a declaration tonight, stating that "On December 26 of last year, the Chinese delegation submitted an amendment to the Committee of Nineteen. Recently, in talks with the chairman of the Committee of Nineteen and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, it was also acknowledged that the Chinese amendment was in line with the spirit of the draft resolution. However, it is strange that the Committee of Nineteen has not given a formal reply to this matter so far. Our delegation has continued to be patient, but newspapers are constantly publishing news that the Committee of Nineteen has a tendency to accommodate major modifications to the draft resolution, and the Chinese side has never received formal notification of this amendment. Therefore, our delegation is very disappointed. In order to clarify the facts completely, our delegation believes that it is necessary to publish the memorandum submitted to the Committee of Nineteen at the end of last year. Our delegation also believes that the principle of not recognizing the 'State of Manchuria' and not allowing the 'State of Manchuria' to continue to exist should be clearly stated in the draft resolution. Our delegation does not hesitate to repeatedly state this point, because China will never allow anyone to undermine its territorial integrity."</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation also stated, "For the past sixteen months, China has consistently demonstrated a spirit of compromise for the sake of peace. Even the amendments recently proposed to the draft resolution are based on the intent and purpose of the original draft of the Committee of Nineteen, which is sufficient to prove China's spirit of compromise. However, in view of the obligations conferred by the Covenant of the League of Nations and for the sake of upholding justice, China is not willing to make any concessions on issues relating to the fundamental principles of the League of Nations. If the principle of not recognizing the current system of 'Manchuria' cannot be clearly included in the draft resolution, then China cannot accept mediation. In addition, the Chinese delegation believes that the United States and Russia have important interests in the Far East. Without the cooperation of these countries, any mediation will be difficult to sustain, or even unacceptable. Moreover, the Lytton investigation team originally had an American representative, which was unanimously approved by all representatives of the Executive Yuan at the time, including Japan. In addition, the participation of a Russian representative in the mediation makes it even more necessary for the United States to participate. The Chinese delegation believes that the proposed mediation committee should be regarded as a subcommittee of the Committee of Nineteen, rather than a newly established body. Moreover, the number of representatives of large and small countries in this subcommittee should maintain the original proportion, so that it can truly reflect the spirit of the Extraordinary Assembly, that is, the spirit from which the Committee of Nineteen emerged. As for the powers of the subcommittee, the Chinese delegation believes that it should not only be engaged in mediation. Only when the subcommittee negotiates with both parties concerned can a good solution be reached. Otherwise, if China and Japan negotiate directly and the subcommittee is limited to mediation, then the Chinese delegation cannot accept it. China has waited for sixteen months. During this period, its sacrifices in life and property have not only been enormous, but its territory has also been increasingly invaded. The reason why China is waiting is nothing more than hoping that the League of Nations will fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Covenant and promote peace and justice. If China has endured and waited for a long time, and still has to negotiate directly with Japan, then China's policy of endurance and compromise can only be regarded as being punished. If the League of Nations had told China sixteen months ago that it should negotiate directly, then the Chinese government would have had other ways to avoid new sacrifices and new suffering. The Chinese delegation firmly believes that the Covenant of the League of Nations should be respected and upheld by all member states. At this moment, only a joint negotiation approach, with a pre-determined basis and cooperation with the United States and Russia, can lead to the final success of mediation." (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Proceedings of the Committee Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The meeting of the Committee of Nineteen on the 20th lasted one hour and forty minutes. Chairman Hymans stated that the League of Nations had not directly received a reply from Japan regarding the proposals of Wednesday, and that only Japanese representative Matsuoka had come to talk, proposing some minor suggestions regarding the so-called compromise plan between Drummond and Sugimura. Irish representative Lester</p>
<p>Proposed an adjournment until tomorrow so that the Japanese government could issue a clear reply to Wednesday's proposals. The Committee approved this motion. After this decision was made, the Committee discussed how the League of Nations would respond if the Japanese reply was not as satisfactory as generally expected. Then, the issue of preparing a report based on Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant was discussed. It was heard that British representative Eden proposed that a drafting subcommittee should be organized to consider the plan. Other members also made several proposals, but the British delegation clearly supported the passage of the Lytton Report. The Committee adjourned at this point, to reconvene at 5 PM tomorrow afternoon, 7:50 PM tonight</p>
<p>Issued a press release, the original text of which is as follows: "The Committee of Nineteen met this afternoon, with Hymans as chairman. Hymans reported that he had received a proposal initiated by the Japanese representative himself, but had not yet received a reply to the question sent by the Committee of Nineteen to the Japanese delegation in Tokyo on Wednesday at the instruction of the Committee of Nineteen. This question stated that the Committee of Nineteen might accept the Japanese amendment to withdraw the article inviting non-member states under the condition that Japan accepts the other articles of the draft proposal prepared by the Committee of December. The Committee has now decided to adjourn until tomorrow, so that the Japanese government can issue its reply. The Committee has exchanged views and discussed the procedures to be adopted if no agreement can be found between the two sides." If what is generally expected is realized, then the League of Nations will immediately begin the difficult task of</p>
<p>Preparing the Report. Those who attended the Committee of Nineteen today included Czech representative Piniés, who had just arrived in Geneva, and British representative Eden. Eden seemed to want to try to moderate the impatience of some members, but this did not prevent tomorrow's meeting. After stating the recent events, Chairman Hymans said that the only question now is a new proposal, according to the Japanese representative, if the Committee approves this proposal, the Japanese delegation can seek the approval of Tokyo. The meeting discussed the chairman's statement, and most people believed that this proposal could not properly meet the "if Japan accepts the other articles of the proposal, non-member states may not be invited" method agreed upon when the Committee adjourned on Wednesday. Therefore, in this situation, the general opinion is that it would be useless for Hymans to read this new proposal. Then, Irish representative Lester proposed an adjournment. During the meeting, people repeatedly mentioned the Japanese</p>
<p>Delaying and Procrastinating. British representative Eden suggested that it might as well organize a drafting committee now to start preparing the report, so as not to waste more time. If it is later felt that mediation is still possible, then the work of preparing the report can be terminated. Several representatives, including the German representative, supported this view, but it was not passed in the end. In this final stage, what is already clearly seen is that the Committee of Nineteen hopes that Japan will give a straightforward answer of "yes or no" to the proposals made by the Committee on Wednesday. The Secretariat of the League of Nations issued a document explaining the origin of the so-called Drummond and</p>
<p>Sugimura Plan, stating that the Secretary-General and Chairman Hymans were both instructed to conduct negotiations on this resolution without affecting its principles. When the Secretary-General returned from vacation, Sugimura visited and discussed the methods that Sugimura believed could be accepted by both the Committee of Nineteen and Japan, including the possibility of inviting the United States and Russia to participate in the discussion. At that time, the Secretary-General told him that he could not guarantee that the Committee of Nineteen could accept this proposal, and that he thought it would not be easy to persuade the Committee to accept it. This method was then telegraphed to Tokyo, and Tokyo made further revisions, the most notable of which was the issue of inviting non-member states to participate in the discussion.

<h3>Consistency of US New and Old Presidents' Far East Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is heard that when the incumbent President Hoover and President-elect Roosevelt met yesterday, they discussed the danger of explosive developments in the Far East. Roosevelt promised to continue Hoover's Stimson Doctrine of not recognizing territories acquired by force and not recognizing the "State of Manchuria". Hoover was very pleased with this.

<h3>An Appeal from the United States, British Newspapers Change Their Tune</h3>
<p>(London) The local weekly publications have a consistent criticism of Japan. The Weekend Magazine stated that the Japanese not only remained unmoved but also mocked British Foreign Minister Simon's gentle words of conscience and judgment, and the Chinese now have a natural disappointment with the West's respect for treaties, and a dangerous mood of anger and injustice is gradually emerging. The New Statesman weekly stated that the hope of reconciliation with the Japanese has been extinguished. What the Japanese have already gained, the Japanese are now keeping without losing. The Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have all become waste paper, the Lytton investigation has also become a farce, and the League of Nations has also become useless. The Spectator weekly stated that, judging from all the evidence, Japan will never accept the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen, and the article of not recognizing the "State of Manchuria" is especially something that Japan is unwilling to accept. US President-elect Roosevelt happened to declare at this time that he would continue to confirm Secretary of State Stimson's doctrine of not recognizing situations created by means of destroying international treaties, which has a profound meaning.

<h3>Foreign Minister Uchida's Speech on Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Claims that Supporting the Puppet State Can Lead to Peace in the East</p>
<p>Consolidating Our National Defense is Falsely Accused as Aggression</p>
<p>Falsely Accuses Our Redification Attempt to Confuse World Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers convened at 11:00 AM this morning. Foreign Minister Uchida delivered a speech on the government's diplomatic policy. The full text is as follows:</p>
<h3>Regarding the Puppet State Incident</h3>
<p>Based on its established policy, the Imperial Government signed a protocol with the "Manchukuo" government on September 15th of last year. The Imperial Government officially recognized "Manchukuo" as an independent state and stipulated that "Manchukuo" respect all treaty rights and interests of the Empire and its subjects within that country. Japan and "Manchukuo" agreed that everything concerning "Manchukuo" was related to the Empire's tranquility and security. It was stipulated that Imperial troops would be stationed within "Manchukuo" to jointly defend the country. As a result of signing this protocol, the foundation for protecting Japan's rights and interests in Manchuria and ensuring "Manchukuo" against internal and external threats has been established, and a powerful guarantee for maintaining peace in the East has been realized. "Manchukuo" has gradually developed since then. Local banditry has gradually been suppressed, and significant improvements in the domestic situation are cause for great joy. Needless to say, this state of affairs has the best influence on the country's commerce, trade, and finance. Therefore, both the people of Manchukuo and Japanese and foreign residents in Manchuria are enjoying prosperity. This fact practically proves the Japanese government's view that recognizing the new state is the only way to resolve the Manchurian problem and preserve peace in the Far East. In view of the above-mentioned good state and prosperity of Manchukuo, and the facts benefiting both Chinese and foreigners, I firmly believe that the League of Nations and the nations of the world will recognize the fair and appropriate attitude taken by the Empire. I have no doubt that the Chinese people will understand in the future that the best way to ensure peace in the Far East is for China, Japan, and Manchukuo to assist each other as independent countries.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Jehol Problem</h3>
<p>Regarding the Jehol problem, I would like to add a word. The Great Wall is the boundary between Manchuria and Mongolia and China, and there is no room for discussion when examining history. Furthermore, Jehol Province is a part of "Manchukuo," as is clear from the "Manchukuo" declaration. However, recently, not only are there those disrupting public order within Jehol Province, but also regular troops under Zhang Xueliang have crossed the border and invaded the province. The Japan-Manchukuo agreement stipulates that the two countries are jointly responsible for maintaining public order in the territory of Manchukuo. Therefore, the so-called Jehol problem is an internal problem of Manchukuo. At the same time, Japan has a major concern for this problem due to its treaty obligations.</p>
<h3>Falsely Accuses Our Government of Being Chaotic</h3>
<p>The Chinese political situation remains chaotic, and the anti-Japanese movement shows no signs of abating. It is reported that the Central Committee of the Kuomintang held a plenary meeting in Nanjing last December, submitting three active anti-Japanese proposals regarding military actions in the North China border region, assistance to the Northeast Volunteer Army, and the rejection of Japanese goods. Subsequently, according to various intelligence received from various parties, this active anti-Japanese proposal was indeed passed at the meeting. Recently, not only have Chinese troops gathered near the border between China and Manchukuo, but some have already invaded Jehol Province. The Imperial Government is now sincerely concerned about this state of affairs in China. Regarding the unfortunate consequences that may result from this situation, I must urge the Chinese government and its people to awaken to serious attention and introspection.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Lytton Report</h3>
<p>Regarding the so-called Lytton Report, which is related to the China-Japan problem, it was submitted to the Council of the League of Nations last October. The Imperial Government's opinion on it was also submitted to the Council in November. Both have already been made public. The content of the Japanese opinion comprehensively explains from various perspectives the Imperial Government's basic view that recognizing Manchukuo and helping its sound development is the only way to ensure peace in the Far East. The government will earnestly explain the gist of this opinion at the Council of the League of Nations, the General Assembly, and other opportunities for negotiation with the nations of the world. The Committee of Nineteen, which declared a temporary adjournment last December, reopened on the 16th of this month to continue discussing the China-Japan problem. The Japanese side has decided to strive in the future at every opportunity when the conference and other conferences of the League of Nations are held, to thoroughly assert the claims within the opinion. The Imperial Government has always sincerely assisted the cause of the League of Nations and strived to enhance its authority. It is fully prepared to cooperate in good faith with the League of Nations' efforts for peace and well-being in the Far East. It goes without saying. However, as stated in the Imperial Government's opinion, when the League of Nations deliberates on issues related to China, it should fully allow flexibility in the League Covenant due to the complexity and difficulty of the country's situation and the strong atmosphere of irregularities and characteristics. This is most necessary because the various principles and practices of international law that are implemented between ordinary countries are greatly altered and implemented in China. Therefore, it is not possible to make an exception solely based on the League Covenant. That is, if one wants to apply the Covenant in China based on precedents implemented in Europe according to the Covenant, the result will not conform to actual events. Not only will it instead make the situation worse, but it will also harm the authority of the League of Nations. This is extremely dangerous for world peace. To maintain peace in the Far East, on the one hand, the cooperation and collaboration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo are necessary, and on the other hand, smooth coordination between the three countries is also needed.</p>
<h3>Regarding Diplomacy with Russia</h3>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, the Soviet Russian Federation government has taken an extremely cautious attitude. Fortunately, no unpleasant incidents have occurred between Japan and Russia to date. This is cause for great joy for Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia. Recently, diplomatic relations between China and Russia have been restored. Therefore, there are often reports that the Redification movement throughout the Far East will become more active. Whether this observation is correct is temporarily not discussed. However, if the Redification forces increase along the Yangtze River and in southern China, where the Communist Party and Communist army are already active, this matter will be a major event for peace in the Far East. The Imperial Government will naturally pay close attention to its future. As for the issue of a non-aggression pact between Japan and Russia, it is the spirit of the Japan-Russia Basic Treaty established in Beiping the year before, and it is also stipulated by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which both countries have signed. There is indeed a relationship of trust between the two countries, and there is absolutely no aggression. However, if one wants to add a formal non-aggression treaty to this spirit, stipulation, and this practical relationship, various views will naturally arise regarding the timing, method, and other aspects. Since the Russian government raised this issue last spring, there have been various discussions in various quarters. In view of the fact that there are various discussions on this issue, the Imperial Government believes that the time has not yet come to discuss or conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Russian government. Therefore, at the end of last year, it replied to the Soviet Russian government with this gist. Although the Japanese government replied to the Russian government in this way, it goes without saying that Japan has no intention of aggression against Soviet Russia. I believe that the Soviet Russian government will definitely not misunderstand this matter either.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>The General Disarmament Conference was held in Geneva last February. Various important cases concerning the army, navy, and air force were discussed. However, the conference gathered representatives from countries around the world and was an unprecedentedly large conference. Because each country expects the safety of its national defense, and its interests are already very complex, no consensus has been seen yet. However, reducing armaments is a cause of peace and is not only one of the important tasks of the League of Nations but also one of the issues that countries around the world are most concerned about now. The Imperial Government's consistent policy of sincerely cooperating with these causes remains unchanged. Therefore, at this conference, the Japanese plenipotentiary, in cooperation with the representatives of various countries, will focus on the success of the conference. The intention of the Imperial Government in proposing a major reduction in world naval armaments last year is also for this purpose. The proposal advocates reducing the shape of various warships, completely abolishing aircraft carriers, reducing the number of A-class cruisers, and reducing the total tonnage of B-class cruisers and destroyers. According to this plan, the aircraft carriers and A-class cruisers of the five countries of Britain, Japan, the United States, France, and Italy could be reduced by about 1.3 million tons. The Japanese proposal takes the principle of reducing offensive power and increasing defensive power, which was passed by this conference, as its foundation. By adopting this principle, the superior naval power will naturally make greater sacrifices than the inferior naval power. If the same rate of reduction is applied to both countries, the safety of the inferior naval power will be greatly damaged. The Japanese proposal also carefully considers the claims of the countries concerned. If the countries fully study the Japanese proposal, I believe that the countries will definitely be able to understand its fair, rational, and practical claims. Looking at the current state of the world's financial circles, in addition to the fact that forty-four countries have suspended the gold standard and their trade has suffered losses due to the sharp decline in silver prices and the chaos in the foreign exchange market, countries are vying to set up restrictions on imports and exports, prohibit imports and exports, and raise tariffs, implementing the so-called isolationist policies in industry and trade. As a result, the great principle of free trade, which has always been developing healthily, has seen a major reversal. This is truly regrettable. However, recently, the enthusiasm for studying methods to eliminate global economic instability has been quite noticeable. Japan also has a policy of cooperating in carrying out such international efforts. Because the World Economic and Financial Conference, which will be held soon, is also based on the above-mentioned gist, the Japanese government often sends representatives to the preparatory committee of the conference to conduct various preliminary studies jointly with the countries. The various diplomatic issues currently facing us have been described above.</p>
<h3>The So-called Government View</h3>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a word about the view of the Imperial Government. It goes without saying that the fundamental meaning of the Empire's diplomacy lies in ensuring peace in the Far East and world peace. In the view of the Imperial Government, in view of the actual situation of the international community today, in order to achieve true peace, it is necessary to recognize the principled universality of the goal of maintaining peace. When applying it, it should be appropriate to the actual situation and allow appropriate flexibility. At the same time, it is most important to respect the forces in all parts of the world that can realize the maintenance of peace. For this reason, Japan recognizes the provisions in the League of Nations Charter that stipulate local understanding as a wise thing. At the same time, it recognizes the Empire's constructive power in the Far East as a realistic pillar for maintaining peace in that area, and it attempts to maintain peace in that area. The Empire has absolutely no territorial ambitions in any part of the world, nor does it want to create incidents against any country in the world. What the Empire is attempting is to ensure the Empire's lifeline based on national defense and justice, and at the same time, to work together with neighboring countries to ensure the tranquility of the Far East, in order to contribute to maintaining world peace. In the Far East, it wants to achieve this goal with its authority and strength. This is the belief of the Japanese people. The fundamental spirit of the Empire's diplomacy since the Meiji era lies in this. The attitude toward the aforementioned Manchurian problem, Japan-Russia relations, and the League of Nations is based on this spirit. Furthermore, the Empire's proposal to the Disarmament Conference also stems from the same spirit. Under the above-mentioned fundamental spirit, the Imperial Government intends to maintain the most friendly relations between countries, to promote the smoothness of trade and the integration of cultures, and to realize the higher ideals of mankind in the world.

<h3>Paris Supports the League of Nations and Urges Effective Measures</h3>
<p>Submits a Letter to the Executive Yuan Calling for Peace</p>
<p>(Paris) The chairman of the International Association of Academic Circles in Support of the League of Nations has recently written to the chairman of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations regarding the Far East problem. This association has more than two million members. In 1931, due to the danger of the Sino-Japanese dispute, it wrote to the chairman of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, stating that if the Executive Yuan and the General Assembly cannot maintain peace and prevent war in the Far East, the credibility of the League of Nations may fall to the ground. This time, the association has made a final appeal to the Executive Yuan, stating that if the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be resolved peacefully, it is imperative to take the necessary measures and sanctions to protect the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant.

The Japanese side fabricated news to confuse public opinion, which is not the truth. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The League of Nations' Mediation of Jehol is in Grave Danger</h3>
<p>㈠ The So-Called Mediation of the League of Nations</p>
<p>The League of Nations' own imperfections are already known to the world, especially deeply understood by us. Although the United States of North America, which holds the reins of world finance, was the initiator, it has remained outside the League since its establishment. The Soviet Union, which occupies one-seventh of the world's land, is also not a member of the League. Among the major powers, the so-called loyal allies are Britain and France in Europe, and Japan in the East. The capitalist countries of continental Europe, with the exception of Germany and Italy, mostly follow the lead of Britain and France. Although Germany and Italy are each wielding their inherent abilities to strive for progress, Germany, which has been defeated for fifteen years, has been subjected to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Although it is now trying to revitalize itself, it has no surplus strength to interfere in foreign affairs due to the customs blockade by various countries and the困顿 of market decadence and rising unemployment. Italy, which advocates international fairness and justice, is indeed a strong power in Southern Europe, one of the powerful forces in the Mediterranean. However, at this time of world transformation, succeeding as the leader of the Fascists and 天産 poor, its reserves of coal and iron ore are less than one-fourth of Japan's. Therefore, apart from pioneering in Africa nearby, it is difficult to show off in the world. Therefore, among the five permanent members of the League of Nations, only Britain and France can指揮如意. Their every move is enough to sway the League of Nations. Thereupon, Japan went back and forth between Britain and France, enticing them with market profits and moving them with the defense of 赤化, and thus was able to safely occupy the Northeast. Since the 9/18 Incident of the previous year, our government has adhered to its consistent policy of patience, requesting the League of Nations to promote truth and justice, quietly waiting for the League of Nations to extend its justice to the three northeastern provinces and return the 珠還合浦.</p>
<p>It is unknown that the cunning and sophisticated Japanese imperialists had already obtained the understanding of Britain and France to sweep through the three northeastern provinces and encompass Shanhaiguan. Thereupon, they publicly declared to the world that "Manchuria" had long ceased to belong to our country, and Jehol was also划入 within the scope of Mongolia. Chapter 10 of the Lytton Commission's report also stated that "Japan now enjoys the power in Jehol Province. To be maintained." This clearly recognizes that Jehol belongs to the scope of Manchuria and Mongolia. At least it also expands the rights and interests acquired by Japan's plunder. Japan is not satisfied with this. Furthermore, it does not want to distribute the rights and interests it has acquired through aggression to the powers, and it must have the League of Nations recognize the "Manchuria (puppet) state" manufactured by its military force in order to fulfill its aggressive intentions. As for the true reason why the League of Nations has been slow and slow and procrastinating and procrastinating, it is not that it has any love for our country or that it is doing it for justice. It is actually wanting to obtain some economic benefits in the three northeastern provinces (the "Manchuria (puppet) state" that Japan calls). Japan only verbally expressed that it has no territorial ambitions towards China. The international justice it calls is "the protection of the lifeline." In other words, it is the military occupation of "Manchuria."</p>
<p>㈡ The Incident Has Already Expanded to Within Shanhaiguan</p>
<p>Now, let us cite Foreign Minister Uchida's speech to the House of Peers on January 21 to clarify this. Uchida's statement said:</p>
<p>'...Recognizing the new country and helping its development is to put the Manchurian issue on a solid foundation and resolve it. Furthermore, I am convinced that this is the only way to preserve peace in the East...'</p>
<p>'...In the end, the three countries of Japan, Manchuria, and China are each independent and help each other is the best way to maintain peace in the East...'</p>
<p>'Jehol is a part of "Manchuria," and it is clear from the establishment of various countries. However, recently, it is not only a significant fact that public order is being disrupted in the province, and the regular troops under Zhang Xueliang have also invaded across the border. Maintaining the security of the "Manchukuo" territory is a responsibility jointly borne by the two countries in the Japan-Manchukuo agreement. Therefore, the Jehol issue is purely an internal issue of "Manchukuo." At the same time, it is the thing that our side (Japan) is most concerned about in the treaty obligations...'</p>
<p>'Regarding the invasion of Jehol territory, I have already mentioned that the Empire is deeply concerned about this state of affairs in China and fears that this situation will lead to unfortunate consequences, so I must warn the Chinese government and the Chinese people to pay deep attention in advance. Furthermore, urge them to reflect...'</p>
<p>Uchida's tone not only ignores Sino-Japanese relations, but even lists the puppet state alongside us and puts forward the absurd and absurd "three countries...helping each other." Furthermore, he recognizes that the movement of our troops within our country is "disrupting governance and security." Are the Japanese troops indiscriminately invading our Liaojihei and bombarding Yuguan not 強寇?</p>
<p>At the same time, after reading Foreign Minister Uchida's speech, we should deeply recognize that we must urgently rise up, work hard, and fight to save ourselves.</p>
<p>First. The fall of Yuguan and the situation of苟安 can no longer be幸存. The enemy has gone deep. It is万难to偷惰.</p>
<p>Second. Chaoyang Temple. Beipiao and other places. Has fallen into enemy hands. The Jehol border has also been bombed, and fearing further hidden endurance will leave no room for survival.</p>
<p>Third. For a year and a half, our government fully trusted the League of Nations to maintain peace. The so-called ultimatum that must be answered within 24 hours is nothing more than an empty wish and cannot restrain Japan.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must know that Uchida Kangzai is a spokesman for the Japanese military and his expressions are sufficient to represent the military's actions. Jehol is now contested by us and coveted by the enemy. If Jehol is unfortunate enough to follow in the footsteps of the northern Manchuria, then Pingjin, as well as Hebei and Shandong, will not be guaranteed. Japan's greed is endless, and the disaster of蚕食 is even greater than 鯨呑.</p>
<p>What our people should deeply reflect on at this crisis is nothing more than a struggle of iron and blood. By using iron and blood to resist violent enemies, we can seek a path to life from amidst a hundred deaths.</p>
<h3>Duan Qirui Passed Jinan Yesterday and Headed South</h3>
<p>(Jinan) This morning at 9:00 AM, Duan Qirui arrived in Jinan on the Pingpu Railway's No. 201 train, in an attached Jingfeng private carriage. Wu Guangxin, Wei Zonghan, and Duan Honggang accompanied him. Qian Yongming, dispatched by Chiang to welcome him in Tianjin, was also on the train. Han Fuju and Zhou Xiuwen, a counselor from the provincial government, greeted him at the station. Duan did not get off the train, but Han boarded to meet and speak with him. Duan praised Han's achievements in governing Shandong. Han invited Duan to stay a little longer when he passed through Jinan on his return north, and Duan agreed. Duan said that people's livelihood is the most important thing, and the North often suffers from drought, so large-scale water conservancy projects are essential. Duan told reporters that his trip to Nanjing was because Mr. Chiang had repeatedly wanted to come north to meet him but had not been able to, and recently sent Mr. Qian to Tianjin to welcome him, expressing that with national difficulties at hand, state affairs should be discussed with national elders, so he could not refuse. Duan said that he could not announce his opinions on state affairs before arriving in Nanjing. Regarding resistance against foreign aggression, material resources are certainly important, but the will and spirit of the people are even more so. It is the critical responsibility of news reporters to promote awareness and awaken the public, and he hoped that they would work hard. Although Duan's hair and beard were white, he was still full of energy, no less than in his younger days. At 9:45 AM, Han and others bid farewell and got off the train. Duan saw them off at the carriage door, nodded in greeting, and continued south on the same train.

<p>(Jinan) Duan Qirui told Han Fuju that he often communicated with Chiang Kai-shek and spoke frankly in his letters. Chiang Kai-shek, for various reasons, was unable to implement his suggestions. He also spoke about water conservancy, suggesting that if more reservoirs were built in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, they could reduce flooding downstream during high water and irrigate fields during droughts. He also asked Han which town he was originally from, and Han replied, "Zhanzhen." Duan said that there were people from Zhanzhen's Third Town among his acquaintances and that they had an old relationship. He also said that he had visited the Meng Temple and Mount Tai, but not the Confucius Temple. He added that the fare on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway should be reduced and that the trade union system was also inappropriate. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hoover and Roosevelt Decide Britain and the U.S. Will Discuss War Debts in Early March</h3>
<p>Future Negotiations Will Still Be Difficult</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 20th - After meeting with President-elect Roosevelt today, U.S. President Hoover immediately announced that Britain and the U.S. would discuss the war debt issue in early March. Secretary of State Stimson will arrange all the preparatory procedures, but the actual discussion will be chaired by the new Democratic Secretary of State.</p>
<p>After hearing this news, American political circles generally believe that Davies will be the new Secretary of State in the next term, representing the United States in negotiations with Britain. This is because, among those currently rumored to be the new Secretary of State, only Davies participated in today's important meeting. Today, the two presidents met in the Red Room of the White House. Secretary of State Stimson, Treasury Secretary Mills, Davies, and Roosevelt's economic advisor, Moley, were all present. Afterwards, President Hoover stated that Britain had requested to discuss war debts, and the new government would be happy to receive British representatives in early March. At that time, it would naturally be necessary to discuss world economic issues of mutual concern to Britain and the U.S., and representatives would also be sent to plan methods for advancing the world situation. Hoover's statement on behalf of both the outgoing and incoming governments is seen as clear evidence that the two presidents completely agree on the two major financial issues. The United States has already achieved success in the preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference, removing the war debt issue from its agenda. It is now able to freely discuss the war debt issue on a broader scale. However, if this issue is not resolved, it will still be an obstacle to economic recovery. Therefore, President Hoover is seeking an early resolution based on the recommendations of the preparatory committee. It is now believed that the British war debt issue may be resolved before the opening of the World Economic Conference, which is entirely possible. Upon hearing this news today, American economic circles all considered it constructive good news, and the market prices on the New York Stock Exchange also rose accordingly.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 21st - Today, British officials were very satisfied to hear the U.S. President's announcement that they were prepared to discuss the war debt issue with Britain. Britain owes the U.S. a total of $9,818,265,000, accounting for more than half of the total war debts owed to the U.S. by fourteen countries. Britain strongly advocates that, in order to seek to eliminate the shackles of the world economic decline, the entire structure of war debts must be reconsidered, and they especially hope that this matter will be discussed quickly, so that an agreement can be reached before the next payment deadline in mid-June. Although the majority of British people oppose punitive payments, it is expected that a majority in Parliament will oppose making further payments before the matter has been settled. If the negotiations in March do not yield much results, it is feared that the British Cabinet may even be overthrown due to a vote of no confidence. As for Britain's attitude, although it seems to have abandoned the idea of total cancellation, officials have stated that they will not be satisfied with a resolution unless there is a substantial reduction. It is predicted that a satisfactory solution in the future will be selected from one or more of the following items: (1) Reduce the total war debt by 50% or 75%; (2) Cancel the interest, only repaying the principal of the 1923 agreement, totaling 4.6 billion gold yuan, to be repaid in 62 years; (3) Reduce the interest rate from 3.5% to 1%, which is approximately equivalent to reducing the interest by one-third; (4) Agree on a lump sum for complete settlement, with the British government issuing bonds on the American market so that the U.S. government can receive cash, with a maximum amount of 500 million gold yuan. It is now expected that although the U.S. government may allow concessions, it will seek other forms of compensation in exchange, such as preferential tariffs on certain American manufactured goods and duty-free imports of American wheat. However, due to the restrictions of the Ottawa Agreement within Britain, it is feared that there may not be much room for concessions on tariff reductions. It is anticipated that there will be many difficulties in future negotiations, especially regarding the $95 million paid on December 15th of last year, which Britain believes should be included in the final lump sum payment, while the United States believes that the payment should be made on time according to the original agreement, which will be the focus of the dispute.</p>
<h3>Einstein Initiates a Peace Advocacy Group</h3>

In the event of a war crisis, they will jointly advocate for peace and eliminate disputes, and it is believed that the world will be able to heed their wise advice.</p>

<h3>Japanese Parliament Opens, Saito Announces Policy Direction</h3>
<p>Red Menace and Financial Issues Are the Focus of Questions</p>
<p>Japanese Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The 64th Parliament opened on the 21st. In addition to an unprecedented budget of 220 million yuan in public bonds and various important bills, the Red Menace incident in the Ministry of Justice is expected to cause significant waves. The government and various political parties organized their political war lineups on the 20th. The Prime Minister and other cabinet members arrived at the Diet at 9:30 a.m. The Seiyukai, Minseito, and the opposition National Alliance also attended in full. The audience was already full, and the authorities were on high alert. The House of Peers declared the meeting open at 10:05 a.m. First, Prime Minister Saito delivered a speech on policy direction, followed by Foreign Minister Uchida on foreign policy. Then, Count Niara of the Kenkyukai questioned the Prime Minister, Interior Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Education Minister on the essence of the national society. The House of Representatives opened at 1:00 p.m. After speeches by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, delivered a speech on financial policy. After the Finance Minister finished speaking, Hamada Kokumatsu, a veteran of the Seiyukai, focused on ideological issues and questioned general administrative issues. Then, Oguchi Kiroku began questioning the Finance Minister on the issue of reconstructing emergency finances.</p>
<h3>Saito Delivers Speech on Policy Direction</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - Prime Minister Saito's speech in the Diet today outlined the following key points of his policy direction: 1. Manchuria Issue: The Japanese government is pleased to have concluded a protocol with "Manchukuo," taking the lead among other countries in recognizing it and establishing formal diplomatic relations. Since then, the country has been developing towards a sound path, which proves that the government's views are correct. Respecting international faith, cooperating with neighboring countries, maintaining peace in the Far East, and contributing to permanent world peace are the fundamental policies of the Empire's diplomacy. The government will provide appropriate assistance to "Manchukuo" during its establishment, and it is deeply believed that this is the most urgent task at that time. 2. Budget Issue: The total amount of the Showa 8th year budget is 2.239 billion yuan, which is an unavoidable expenditure in the current situation. As a result, the revenue is 895 million yuan short, and it is inevitable to resort to public bonds. Some may fear for the future of the finances, but the financial community has improved once, and it is hoped that the revenue will increase. In terms of expenditure, expenses such as the Manchurian Incident and the improvement of military equipment will not require as much funding as they do now. Once the balance of payments is restored, I believe that the finances will be greatly improved in a few years. 3. Ideological Issue: It is a pity that there are recently dangerous ideas that are incompatible with the national essence. However, it is also a pity that there are reactionary individuals who want to take violent direct action. The government will not only crack down on them, but also actively guide thoughts through political education. 4. Situation Recovery Issue: The recovery of rural villages and small and medium-sized businesses and industries is currently underway. The result has been a decline in exchange rates, which has promoted exports. Small and medium-sized businesses and industries have therefore seen a major turnaround. At the same time, the government has launched a national regeneration movement, hoping to open up the difficult situation with the unity of the entire country. 5. Trade Improvement Issue: Foreign trade has greatly improved, and the industrial community has shown signs of activity. The signs of economic recovery are already very obvious. However, the government is further seeking to assist important industries. 6. Political Purification Issue: The current cabinet takes the purification of politics as one of its missions. Therefore, it plans to submit an amendment to the election law to this session of the Diet. 7. Conclusion: In short, the situation in diplomacy and domestic affairs has not yet escaped the realm of emergency. The Empire will thoroughly believe in its beliefs, devote all its efforts to establishing international justice and contributing to world peace, and internally promote the national spirit in order to open up the difficult situation.</p>
<h3>Takahashi Delivers Speech on Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The House of Representatives opened this meeting at 1:00 p.m. Prime Minister Saito and Foreign Minister Uchida's speeches were the same as those delivered in the House of Peers. Later, Takahashi, the Minister of Finance, at the high age of 80, took the stage to deliver a speech on finances as follows: The expenditures for the Showa 8th year are nearly 2.239 billion, so they cannot all be covered by ordinary revenue. Today, the plans for increasing taxes and other revenues seem to be gradually recovering from the economic situation, so everything is handled by public bonds. The recent situation in the general economic community, even in countries around the world, is still in a sad state, so its future is difficult to predict. However, Japan is different from Europe and the United States. There is no difficulty in compensating for war debts, and the foreign debt is not huge, and it is in a position of science. Since the ban on gold, the foreign exchange rate has fallen, and the reason is the actual situation of international payments. The main concern is the international instability centered on the Manchurian issue and inflation, and the result is to encourage natural exports and open up new sales channels. If the exchange rate falls too low, there will be disadvantages, so the Exchange Control Law is proposed at this meeting to further prevent investment methods. Also, in terms of finances, the issuance of huge amounts of public bonds will inevitably lead to an increase in currency issuance, so it is impossible not to worry about the undesirable results. However, for the purpose of so-called reasonable control of currency, the Bank of Japan prevents the disadvantages of inflation, so there are no disadvantages.</p>
<h3>House of Representatives Questions Red Menace Issue</h3>
<p>Japanese Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The House of Representatives opened at 1:15 p.m. After the speech by Finance Minister Takahashi, Seiyukai member Hamada Kokumatsu led the questioning. Hamada took the stage, first analyzing the so-called extraordinary era, advising on the abnormal current situation of the political organization, and referring to the national ideology issue, saying that judicial officials internally produced Communist Party members, and that communism gradually infiltrated the military. How does the government deal with these communist elements? Hamada then questioned the government's beliefs regarding recent diplomatic issues, and also brought up the issue of the Bank of Japan's urgent sale of public bonds and the issue of inflation from December 14th to January 14th of last year, condemning the government's negligence. The debate lasted for an hour and a half before he left the stage. Prime Minister Saito responded that the satisfactory development of constitutional government is what he desires, so he will spare no effort in the progress of political parties. The communist party incident will be handled with all efforts. The truth of the May 15th Incident has not yet reached the time to be announced. Justice Minister Koyama then took the stage to reply that the May 15th Incident cannot be announced at this time. Hamaguchi continued to press the Prime Minister on this issue, but the Prime Minister did not answer, and Hamaguchi had no choice but to stop questioning. Oguchi Kiroku of the Seiyukai took the stage in turn and began questioning. Oguchi stated that he did not oppose the issuance of huge amounts of public bonds, but that the government's handling methods for the finances of the ninth year, the tenth year, and the future. How will the expenses for the improvement of military equipment, the foreign exchange loss, and the emergency recovery affect the future financial plan? What is the Finance Minister's determination regarding the administrative and financial reorganization investigation committee? Oguchi also turned to questioning general economic issues, asking what level the government believes is most appropriate for commodity prices and currency circulation, and why the Finance Minister did not prevent the urgent and rapid decline of the exchange rate. If the exchange rate presents an unnatural surge in the future, what measures will the government take? Finance Minister Takahashi replied, explaining the reasons why he could not determine the future financial plan in the current situation, and also revealing the government's beliefs on this. Then, Kawasaki Katsu of the Minseito took the stage to question, stating that the budget for the eighth year relies heavily on public bonds, and the result is that the financial faction is weakened, and it causes the exchange rate to plummet. The increase in public bonds is a permanent burden, and the low-price policy has no great benefits. Those who benefit from protective tariffs and the fall of the exchange rate should naturally have the obligation to bear and relieve this national loss. In order to stabilize the exchange rate, there is no other method than to improve international lending, establish a financial foundation, and restore domestic credit. Inflation caused by the fall in the exchange rate is a major threat to the lives of the common people. What rescue measures does the government have for this? Minister of Commerce Takahashi took the stage to reply, stating that the government's budget expansion and public bond policy were by no means without a plan. The reason for the fall in the exchange rate is inappropriate for the argument that the income and expenditure are unbalanced. After the Finance Minister replied, Prime Minister Saito stated that he had no need to reply. Then Kawasaki and the Finance Minister questioned each other on the issue of increasing taxes, and the meeting adjourned at 6:49 p.m.</p>
<h3>Future of Manchurian Plan Unpredictable</h3>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - After Finance Minister Takahashi's speech in the Lower House today, Seiyukai financier Oguchi Kiroku criticized Takahashi, saying that the government's budget was short by about 90 million yuan, which was very unreasonable to fully cover with public bonds. The government must fundamentally solve the Manchurian Incident and the financial resources for emergency relief. Takahashi replied that the future of the Manchurian plan is still chaotic, the international political situation is still dangerous, and it may be resolved in five or ten years, but it is difficult to predict at present. Therefore, the necessary expenses in the future are still unknown. The financial problem is in this state, and it cannot be fundamentally solved. It can be seen that the future of Japan's finances has been unable to make up for the military expenses of the invasion.</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Expresses the Right to Publish the Course of Negotiations</p>
<p>TASS News Agency, Moscow, 21st - Regarding the reaction caused by the Soviet Union's publication of the course of negotiations for the Japan-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty in the Japanese newspaper, TASS News Agency has now confirmed that the Soviet government has never been unable to publish the content of the negotiations and the text of both parties. Therefore, the Soviet Union is absolutely not bound by any responsibility in this regard. The issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was proposed by the Soviet government. This issue has been publicly proposed and publicly discussed in the world's newspapers for a year, especially in Japanese newspapers. The Soviet government has no intention of concealing the course of its negotiations from the Soviet people.</p>
<h3>Philippines to Join League of Nations</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 20th - According to the Philippine Independence Act passed by the U.S. Congress, the Philippines will still need ten years to become independent. However, there are now supporters of independence here, discussing the issue of the Philippines joining the International League of Nations unofficially with European representatives. Philippine leaders have long claimed that joining the League of Nations would greatly enhance the island's security after independence. It is expected that the Filipinos will definitely welcome this move, and Spain, which still has cultural relations with the island of Văn, is also happy to initiate this matter.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Japanese Army's Oppression of the People in Northeast China</h3>
<p>Fabricating False News to Incite People's Hearts</p>
<p>Forcing Celebrations for the New Year to Falsely Embellish Peace</p>
<p>Ordering the Puppet Army to Attack Jehol to Make Us Harm Each Other</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence, the people here are most concerned about the fighting at Yuguan, and they spare no effort to search for real news in order to know the progress of our military in Guannei. Japan, fearing the worries of the rear and the people uniting to resist, fabricated all kinds of news unfavorable to us, forced local newspapers to publish it, and broadcast it to the people. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Yuguan war, there has been no news here that is favorable to us. At the same time, Japan fabricated unfounded news such as Zhang Xueliang's escape, the collapse of the Northeast Army, and the Shanxi army entering Tianjin and Beijing to seize territory. Upper-level people can identify the truth and falsehood of the news, but lower-level people mistakenly believe it to be true. Therefore, those who clench their fists and grieve in secret are unknown. Newspapers must pay the highest price to publish the news from the puppet state news agency, and deleting and altering it is not allowed. When publishing, the title should also clearly show that the Chinese are the enemy, otherwise it is not allowed to be published. No newspaper dares to disobey. Some merchants or wealthier households secretly install radio receivers in their homes and secretly listen to the Beijing and Ping radio broadcasts every night, relying on them as the only source of real hope. However, the radio broadcasts often exaggerate and are not factual, so the people dare not fully believe them. Those who come from Guannei are asked if there is any news. Once something is heard, people, whether they know each other or not, spread the word around as a mutual comfort. The taste of being slaves of a subjugated nation has been fully experienced by the 30 million people in Northeast China for a year. Recently, the Japanese have also restricted the installation of radio receivers, probably wanting to completely cut off the hope of the Chinese.</p>
<p>Recently, because the Lunar New Year is approaching, Japan is anesthetizing the Chinese people and embellishing peace. The main Japanese agencies in various places distribute Spring Festival couplets and gods, such as Heaven, Earth, Emperor, and 君, and give multiple copies to each agency, group, and store, forcing them to be posted in a timely manner. They also ordered the puppet state propaganda committees in the major ports of Jilin, Liaoning, Changchun, Harbin, and Heilongjiang to prepare Lunar New Year celebration parties, hold dragon lantern stilt walking and other lower-level acrobatics, and lure the Chinese people into forgetting their country and their worries. However, groups and stores in this environment and as slaves of a subjugated nation have no such interest. Remembering that during the Gregorian New Year, Japan tried its best to pressure merchants and groups to send congratulatory letters, but the merchants were fundamentally lacking in interest and did not tacitly agree. Except for people in the agencies, no one was willing to send letters to congratulate the New Year. Therefore, for the Lunar New Year, the Japanese will order the responsible groups to urge them to celebrate the New Year with all their strength. After the subjugation of the Northeast, the people's thoughts and spirits are also not allowed to be free. The Japanese army is invading Jehol and plans to form five mixed brigades of the puppet state army. Each brigade has four regiments, three brigades are recruited by Jilin and Liaoning, and two brigades are recruited by Heilongjiang. The Japanese will allocate military equipment and bullets and order them to go to the Jehol border within a month or so, wanting to first make our compatriots harm each other, and then the Japanese army will take advantage of our exhaustion to attack forward. Recently, due to insufficient recruitment, it is planned to order the two brigades of Shen Cheng of the pseudo-suppression bandit army in Jilin and the two detachments of Zhou Zuolin and Wang Kezhen of the pseudo-Heilongjiang army to be organized into mixed brigades and dispatched to Jehol in the shortest possible time. However, Zhou and Wang still have some conscience and are still hesitant about harming their own flesh and blood. They are still unwilling to reorganize. The Japanese army is eager to attack Jehol and may seek other pseudo-armies in the future. (January 11)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation After the Fall of Yuguan</h3>
<p>Sparse Population Within Thirty Miles of the War Zone</p>
<p>The Morale East of the Luan River Is Very High</p>
<p>Changli Correspondence, residents within thirty miles south of Qinhuangdao and east, west of Shanhaiguan, north of Shimen Village and east, and west of Jiumenkou, who have the ability to evacuate, have long evacuated elsewhere. Because the area has become a major war zone, not only is the population sparse, but even pigs, sheep, and poultry are rarely left behind. The desolate scene can be described. As for the recent situation in the war zone, it is briefly described as follows:</p>
<h3>Neutral Zone Delineated Within Our Territory</h3>
<p>Because of the Sino-British joint venture in the Kailuan Coal Mine in Qinhuangdao, the Kailuan Coal Mine Wharf was built along the coast south of the railway. The British section chief of the Qinhuangdao station of the Beining Railway, Ceylon, and two British naval captains vigorously mediated and designated the area south of the railway as a neutral zone. No Chinese soldiers in military uniforms were allowed to cross south of the railway, and no Japanese soldiers in leather hats and leather clothes were allowed to cross the line. It is a painful matter of humiliating compromise to delineate a Chinese-Japanese buffer neutral zone within Chinese territory. However, since our soldiers regard this railway as a gulf, the residents have also moved from north of the railway to south of the railway in succession, thinking it is a place to avoid disaster.</p>
<h3>Enemy Marines Land to Demonstrate</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 a.m. this morning (16th), more than 20 marines from the Japanese warship in Qinhuangdao suddenly landed from the Kailuan Wharf and armed themselves to break into the so-called neutral zone south of the railway to demonstrate and provoke. The situation suddenly became tense. Our army immediately made proper preparations. Many residents south of the railway were awakened from their sleep, not knowing where to go, or were panicked. But before long, the Japanese soldiers retreated, and the situation also temporarily eased. However, no matter how local the easing is, it is ultimately difficult to break the Japanese warlords' predetermined plan of aggression against us.</p>

<h3>The Scene in Changli County Is Desolate</h3>
<p>Changli County, ninety miles west of Qinhuangdao, closes its city gates every night at 8:00 p.m. The families of all the officers have already moved to Tianjin and Beijing. The wealthy people in the area are also preparing to evacuate. Major commercial factories such as the Xinhua Cannery have already stopped working. Schools and groups such as Huimin Middle School have also taken early vacations. But the people east of the Luan River, although in the terror of the war, deeply hope that they can win in one battle and defeat the enemy for the sake of the nation. Destroying their homes to relieve the country's difficulties is also without complaint. The morale is so high.</p>

<h3>Yuguan Traitors Sell Out the Country for Glory</h3>
<p>After the fall of Shanhaiguan, traitors appeared one after another. The most famous are: (1) Na Qifu, the former director of the Beining Railway Bridge Factory, which is located in Shanhaiguan. It is our country's only railway bridge factory. The machines in the factory are worth more than 9 million taels. After Shanhaiguan fell, Na immediately surrendered to the Japanese army, requested to maintain his original position, and filled out a surrender application to the Japanese Kwantung Army's Ichii Valley, still serving as the director of the factory. On the 10th, he immediately gathered the workers and started work as usual. From then on, our country's railway construction bridge engineering will have to borrow from foreigners. (2) Ma Hongru, who participated in the Tianjin Incident, was once wanted by the authorities. After that, he served as the director of the Yuguan Branch of the Special Public Security Bureau of Hebei Province, whose authority was above the county magistrate. During the Yuguan Incident, Ma led his staff to the west gate of the city and took the stage to give a shameless speech to the evacuees, saying, "You don't have to evacuate, even if you evacuate to Tianjin and Beijing, you still have to return to Japan." On the one hand, he blocked the people from leaving the city, and his crimes are too numerous to count. He has now been promoted by the Japanese army to the director of the Shanhaiguan Police Bureau. (3) Li Detong, the former stationmaster of the Shanhaiguan Station of the Beining Railway, had an important position and a generous salary. After our army retreated, he was appointed by the puppet government to continue his original post and urged the employees to maintain the traffic of the pseudo-Fengshan Road. (4) Director Sun of the Beining Railway Shanhaiguan Hospital (name unknown) has also surrendered to the enemy and led his subordinates to run the Japanese wounded soldiers hospital, which is a life-saving machine for treating the enemy. The equipment of the Beining Railway Hospital is the best among the railway hospitals in the country. Now that it is used to help the enemy, is it enough for the traitor's flesh to be eaten?

<h3>Establishment of the Guangdong Provincial Air Defense Committee</h3>
<p>Raising Funds for the Defense of Airspace</p>
<p>Air Defense Equipment to be Designed by Experts</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, due to the urgency of the national crisis, the province of Guangdong is reorganizing national defense, and the public is also rising to assist. Representatives from all sectors of Guangzhou convened a conference on solidifying air defense at the provincial party headquarters on the 13th of this month. Over a hundred representatives from various sectors attended, and it was immediately decided to organize an air defense committee, with the Anti-Japanese Federation of Municipal Schools, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Trade Association, the Machine Workers' Union, the Eastern Suburb Farmers' Association, the Lawyers' Association, the National Salvation Association, the Women's Federation, the Overseas Comrades' Association, the Teahouse Workers' Union, and the Civil University Student Autonomous Association, eleven groups in total, as members of the air defense committee. A method for raising air defense funds was also decided upon. On the 16th, the air defense committee was formally established, and the executive committee members were sworn into office. The National Salvation Association, the Anti-Japanese Federation of Municipal Schools, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Teahouse Workers' Union, and the Women's Federation were designated as standing committee members. The Silver Trade Union, the Machine Workers' Union, the Overseas Comrades' Association, the Civil University Student Association, and the Lawyers' Association were designated as members of the custodial committee. The provincial party headquarters was designated as the director of the general affairs section, the Anti-Japanese Federation of Municipal Schools as the director of the propaganda section, and the Municipal Senior High School Association as the director of the finance section.

The methods for raising air defense funds include five items: (1) Selling sealed enemy goods, allocating 50% of the proceeds; (2) Allocating 20% of the prize money from charitable lotteries, and allocating all unclaimed prize money, with a three-month limit; (3) Collecting half a month's rent from all shops and houses in the city, to be borne by the landlords; (4) Voluntary donations; (5) Other funds raised are to be exclusively used for air defense. Collection of charitable lottery prize money was set to begin on the 16th. Collection of shop and house rent will be entrusted to the Public Security Bureau from February 1st. It is reported that the air defense committee has hired experts to design air defense equipment, with a total cost of under 10 million yuan. In addition to the 1 million yuan each allocated by the provincial and municipal governments, the air defense committee can also raise over 1 million yuan. Additional needed funds will be raised through donations from wealthy individuals. (January 17th)</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A Bird's-Eye View of the Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry, after a decision by the provincial government, is being abolished, and its affiliated agencies have also been ordered to close down, effective at the end of last year, to be directly received and managed by the respective county governments. Although the silk industry circles of various counties have been running around and appealing, they have failed to persuade the authorities to reverse their decision. After receiving the order, the county government appointed Shen Xichun as the custodian of the county farm and Wen Yiqing as the assistant. They arrived at the farm on the 1st of this month to take over, which was handed over by the acting director Hua Qian. As for planting work, it is still proceeding as usual to avoid neglect and damage, which has been reported to the county magistrate Chen for review and approval. However, the county's farm is a production agency, and its closure will greatly damage agriculture. Therefore, local people, recognizing this, are actively planning remedial measures to avoid interruption. Moreover, the silk industry in the county is unusually developed, leading all other counties, with annual production of several million yuan. In the heyday of silk factories, there were as many as fifty-five in urban and rural areas. In the previous years, due to the disastrous defeat in the silk market, the capital of the factories was almost entirely depleted, and they closed down one after another. The number of unemployed workers reached forty or fifty thousand. Last autumn, the silk market showed signs of recovery, and the factories resumed operation one after another, with more than twenty factories in operation, which was able to temporarily maintain the status quo. It was hoped that the silk market would recover this year, so as to make up for the losses. Therefore, attention must be paid to the selection of seeds, silkworm rearing, and silk reeling, and it is hoped that the government will provide guidance and assistance. Unexpectedly, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry suddenly announced its abolition, and silk cocoon merchants were left without leadership, causing widespread panic. At this time, the authorities in Zhejiang Province felt the need to promote and improve the silk industry. Because the province lacked silkworm seeds, it could not promote and improve the industry, so it purchased a large number of silkworm seeds from Jiangsu Province, preparing to actively promote the industry. When the leaders of the silk industry in Wuxi heard this news, they were extremely panicked, because the original local species in Wuxi had long been eliminated, and it all depended on the cultivation of improved seeds. Now that the silkworm seeds have been suddenly taken away by Zhejiang Province, the silk industry in Wuxi will inevitably suffer a setback and cannot be saved. In order to remedy this, it is planned to set up a silkworm breeding center and purchase 10,000 silkworm egg sheets for use. The required funds will be raised by borrowing, and it can be implemented as soon as it is settled, so as to avoid the silk industry and the farmers' economy from falling into a desperate situation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Coffin Robbery Occurs in Xujia Bridge</p>
<p>Ye, the deceased mother of Xu Zhenzhi, the head of Gudian Township in the eighteenth district of Wujin County, passed away in the city residence some time ago. The coffin was kept at home. When the Shanghai war broke out, a boat was hired to transport the coffin back to the hometown and placed next to Xujia Bridge. It was scheduled to be buried with her deceased husband on the 26th of this month according to the lunar calendar. Unexpectedly, the coffin was stolen by bandits the night before last. A corner of the coffin lid was cut off, all the burial objects were looted, and the corpse was damaged, which was too horrible to describe. After the incident, it was reported to the nearby Public Security Fourth Branch for investigation. Yesterday (the 20th), district head Zhu Yizheng also reported to the county government for arrest.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Police Officer Executed for Stopping Car and Committing Murder</p>
<p>Sun Ruhe, a squad leader of the tax police, and Xu Jiaming, a police officer, set up a roadblock at the Tangzha River estuary. When they failed to stop a car, they fired three shots, hitting Gu Yinglong, the principal of Baipu School, in the back of the head, killing him instantly. The criminal police officers then forced the driver to take the corpse to Rugao. Road police stopped them for inspection. Sun Ruhe falsely accused the deceased of being a salt smuggler and claimed to take him to the headquarters for investigation. When the car arrived at Baipu, it was intercepted by the police and regiment and sent to the court. On the 20th, magistrate Sheng interrogated them. Sun Ruhe confessed to stopping the car and firing the shots. Xu Jiaming confessed to stopping the car. The driver, Qian Er, and other passengers, Li Rongqing, testified. After the debate, the court announced the verdict on the spot. Sun Ruhe was sentenced to death for intentional homicide. Xu Jiaming was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for obstructing freedom.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Financial Crisis in Yangzhou</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army repeatedly invaded the city of Yangzhou, the financial situation has been indirectly affected quite a bit. Recently, depositors and banks have become wary after the collapse of the renowned Dechun Qianzhuang, adding another obstacle to the flow of the economy. Furthermore, because the Central Bank recently requires cash for all remittances, regardless of how reliable the tax funds are and regardless of the amount, it is said that the head office has decided at a board meeting that all transactions to and from the port, regardless of creditworthiness, must be in cash, which further absorbs cash. Many qianzhuang and goods stores are finding it difficult to sustain themselves as the lunar New Year approaches. It is difficult to predict what the market will be like next spring. It seems that the administrative authorities and business leaders must plan early.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Boat Robbed En Route on Jiaoshi Route</p>
<p>The express boat traveling between Pinghu and Jiaoshi was robbed the other day when it reached a place six miles from Jiaoshi. Suddenly, two passengers ordered the boat to stop ashore. As soon as the mooring cable was tied, two people with short guns were seen on the shore. They, along with the two passengers, broke into the cabin and searched it thoroughly. More than 1,300 yuan in deposits from the Pinghu Zhicheng Qianzhuang and hundreds of yuan of passengers' money were robbed.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Mother and Daughter Commit Suicide Due to Marriage Issues</p>
<p>Wang Guixiang, a resident of Dongwu in Yinxian County, is engaged in farming and his family is well-off. His wife, surnamed Mou, is over forty years old and has a daughter who is now nineteen years old and has a beautiful face. In September of this year, her mother arranged for her to marry the third son of Zhang Baosheng in the same village. However, Wang's daughter was deeply unwilling, so after being betrothed to the Zhang family, she became depressed. When Mr. and Mrs. Wang saw their daughter so dejected, they also had regrets. A few days ago, they begged the original matchmaker to break off the engagement with the Zhang family, willing to return the engagement gift of 110 yuan. The Zhang family agreed to dissolve the engagement, as the daughter was unwilling and could not be forced. Originally, nothing further should have occurred, but Zhang Baosheng's eldest son made excessive demands, saying that it would cost no less than 300 yuan. Mr. Wang's family was not wealthy enough to comply immediately, which caused friction within the family. Unexpectedly, Wang's wife, feeling wronged by her husband and daughter, was filled with remorse and committed suicide by swallowing opium on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 17th). By the time her family discovered it, she had already died from the poison. Wang's daughter, grieving over her mother's tragic death and believing herself to be responsible, also committed suicide with scissors on the morning of the next day (the 18th). Wang Guixiang was deeply saddened by the tragic changes in his family and took a boat to Ningbo that afternoon, complaining to the Yinxian County Local Court that his wife and daughter's deaths were caused by the coercion of Zhang Baosheng's eldest son, requesting the arrest of the perpetrator and legal action. After receiving the report, the court immediately sent prosecutor Fang to examine the bodies and investigate the truth of the case.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Appealing Criminal Jumps off Train to Escape</p>
<p>Yao Jinguan from the Xinxin District of Jiaxing was sentenced by the Jiaxing Local Branch Court to five years of imprisonment for helping to hide Yang A'er, who had seduced Lu San'nan, a girl under the age of twenty. Yang A'er was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Yang and Yao appealed because they were not satisfied with the verdict. After the High Court held a hearing, it rejected the appeal. On the 20th, the two criminals were handed over to Zhao Ruilin, a patrol captain, and Luo Rong, a police officer, of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, who took them to Jiaxing by train. When the train passed Wangdian Station, Yao Jinguan claimed that he needed to urinate and asked to have his handcuffs released. The patrol captain released them. Unexpectedly, Yao jumped off the train after entering the toilet and escaped. Zhao immediately jumped off the train to chase after leaving the files and Yang in the care of the police. After the train arrived at the station, the police escorted Yang to the branch court, but it was not accepted because the criminals were not all there. Later, the police escorted the criminal to the Public Security Bureau, which kept both the police officer and the criminal under custody while informing the Wangdian Public Security Branch Bureau to investigate and arrest the fugitive.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Discusses the Political Participation Council and the Draft Constitution</h3>
<p>Formulating Laws and Regulations for Autumn Convocation</p>
<p>Completing the Constitution in One Year at the Earliest</p>
<p>The League of Nations is Powerless; Only Self-Reliance Can Save Us</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, accompanied by Liang Hancao, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, and members of the Legislative Yuan, Ma Chaojun, Jian Youwen, Chen Jianru, Zhong Tianxin, and others, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the night before last. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. Sun. According to Mr. Sun, the Political Participation Council is expected to be convened this autumn, and the draft constitution can be completed in one year at the earliest. A detailed record of his remarks is as follows:</p>
<h3>Convocation of the Political Participation Council</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun first stated that the convocation of the Political Participation Council had been stipulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be convened within this year. The original proposal was transferred to the Central Standing Committee, and then to the Central Political Council, to determine the principles of the organizational law of the Political Participation Council. Then, the Legislative Yuan would draft laws and regulations based on the principles. However, the Central Political Council has recently been busy discussing other important issues, so the principles of the organizational law of the council have not yet been discussed. It is expected that all laws and regulations can be formulated and officially convened this autumn.</p>
<h3>Drafting of the Constitution</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun continued, regarding the drafting of the constitution, the Legislative Yuan has organized a Constitution Drafting Committee with more than 30 members. For the sake of special caution, it was decided to widely solicit opinions from all parties, first dividing into several groups, each focusing on a specific issue for thorough discussion. The results of each group's research will be reported to the committee, which will decide on a principle and send it to the Central Political Council for review. After it is passed, the Constitution Committee will draft the initial draft of the constitution, and then hire domestic experts to solicit opinions on the initial draft, so as to conduct public research in order to gather wisdom. Then, gather opinions from all parties, revise it again, and form a perfect constitution, so that when it is implemented in the future, there will be no difficulties. Therefore, the completion of the constitution will take at least one year.</p>
<h3>Revision of Civil and Criminal Law</h3>
<p>In addition, regarding the current civil law, because there is no interpretation, it is planned to formulate interpretations of civil law, so that law enforcers know the central legislative intent. The current criminal law is mostly based on the drafts from the Beijing government era, which are largely unsuitable and should be revised. The land law still needs to continue to promulgate the land implementation law. The autonomy law has too many ideals, resulting in inconvenience in internal implementation, all of which must be reformed and reorganized. The labor and commercial laws are only partial and must also be completed. In short, there is much criticism from the outside world about the current laws. The reason is that they focus too much on theory and not enough on practice, resulting in a failure to conform to the Chinese situation. All of this must be revised in the future. At the same time, because the issue of law is a specialized subject, slight carelessness is enough to lead to many omissions, so meticulous research is essential.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Through Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>The League of Nations' handling of the Sino-Japanese incident has shown that it is powerless. The only effect of the just voice of our country's representatives in the international community is to win the sympathy of world opinion. Our country can only resolve to resist Japan to the end, taking strength as the premise. Use as much strength as you have. Cooperate from top to bottom and resist to the end. The generals in North China also have the greatest determination to resist for self-defense, without being discouraged or intimidated. National salvation can only be achieved through self-reliance.</p>
<h3>Duan Qirui Goes South</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun then talked about the situation in North China, saying that although Duan Qirui's ideas are relatively old, he loves the country and can guarantee that he will not lag behind others. Now that he has resolutely gone south, we naturally express our great welcome. From now on, all unfounded rumors can be dispelled, and Duan himself will not be exploited by villains. As for Director Wang, he is currently recuperating at a spa hospital in the Czech Republic and will be able to return home in about two or three weeks.</p>
<h3>Meeting at the Cultural Center</h3>
<p>As for my trip to Shanghai, it is to attend the preparatory meeting of the Zhongshan Cultural Education Center tomorrow (i.e., today). This is a weekly routine meeting. Because preparations are just beginning, I have to attend in person. I plan to go to Nanjing in a day or two to actively carry out the work of the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Association to Abolish War to Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>Offering Methods for Reorganizing the Sichuan Situation</p>
<p>The League to Abolish Internal War sent a letter to Zhang Qun, chairman of the Sichuan Affairs Reorganization Committee, yesterday: "Mr. Yuejun, the Sichuan war dispute is urgently awaiting settlement. Our association, based on its war aspiration to abolish internal war, previously publicly elected representatives to petition the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to resolutely stop it. On the 11th of November, we invited academic and commercial groups from Sichuan in Shanghai to jointly discuss and resolve five measures to telegraph to the central government to adopt. The second of those measures was to request the central government to quickly organize the Sichuan Affairs Reorganization Committee, with you as the chairman, with senior central officials and representatives of the people from the war industry inside and outside Sichuan as members, and no active military personnel to participate. Recently, reading the newspaper, I learned that the central government has adopted the association's suggestion to organize the Reorganization Committee and appointed you to preside over it. Upon hearing the news, we were exceedingly delighted. You were formerly the mayor of Shanghai and your governance achievements were obvious. Now reorganizing the Sichuan situation, you will certainly uphold the long-cherished aspiration of peace and comprehensiveness, and set a plan for long-term security, so that the Sichuan generals will be moved by your sincere love for the country, the hometown, and the people, and will readily accept and implement it step by step. Will this not benefit the people of Sichuan and change the international outlook? Now, the five measures resolved by our association are enclosed for your perusal. May they be used as reference. Not presuming to hope too much. I wish you well." Attached is a copy of the five urgent measures to stop the Sichuan war: "(1) Request the central government to order the Sichuan army to cease fire immediately. (2) Request the central government to quickly organize the Sichuan Affairs Reorganization Committee, with Zhang Qun as the chairman, with senior central officials and representatives of the professional people inside and outside Sichuan as members, and no active military personnel to participate. (3) Request the central government to authorize the Reorganization Committee with full authority to reorganize the Sichuan army, transfer them to recover lost territories, and perform the duties of suppressing bandits and guarding the border. At the same time, reorganize the people's wealth, group parties, and other administrations, and let the people's militia take charge of public security throughout the province, and prepare to convene a provincial people's congress to discuss long-term peace and security measures. (4) Request the central government to strictly prohibit the entry of arms and ammunition into Sichuan. (5) Request the central government to investigate and deal with the culprits of the Sichuan war and issue a clear order in advance that those who do not obey the Reorganization Committee's orders will be severely punished without leniency."</p>
<h3>Wu Peifu Responds to Telegram from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Cautiously Maintaining the Meaning of Inside and Outside in the Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<p>=Normally Aspiring to Guan Yu and Yue Fei, Literary and Historical Matters=</p>
<p>=Never Entering the Doors of Guests of Different Clothes and Customs=</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from Wu Ziyu from Beiping yesterday: "Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and please forward to Mr. Mu Ouchu, and all gentlemen of the Shanghai Municipal Local Association and the Exchange Federation, I acknowledge and appreciate your kindness and concern in the recent telegrams. Your righteousness and solemnity show the depth of your love. Although I am in the wilderness, I have never dared to lag behind others in sharing the same hatred against the enemy. I normally aspire to Guan Yu and Yue Fei, and I regard literary and historical matters as models. I am especially cautious about the meaning of inside and outside in the Spring and Autumn Annals and dare not lose it. Therefore, I am residing in the old capital and discussing morality with friends from all over the world. Guests of different clothes and races have never entered my doors. This can be shown to the countrymen. In the past, when An Lushan rebelled, only Pingyuan raised troops in the twenty-four counties of Hebei. Emperor Xuanzong sighed, "What would Zhenqing do if he did not criticize him?" Reflecting on the past and looking at the present, how can I not be filled with emotion? I am encouraged by Brother Xiao with Changshan, so I cannot help but think of it. As for inducing comrades to follow the professional path, I have said everything in the past and I will continue to do so. I will briefly describe my straightforwardness and hope that you will understand. Wu Peifu kowtows, Hao."</p>

<h3>Reasons for Silk Factory Shutdown</h3>
<p>Sharp Drop in Japanese Silk Prices</p>
<p>Approaching Lunar New Year</p>
<p>There are a total of 113 single and double palace silk factories in the city. Because the sales of European and American silk have been declining year after year, the silk factories have been unable to support themselves and have closed down one after another. In the summer months of June and July last year, only a dozen silk factories in the city were barely able to operate. Later, the government encouraged exports, exempted the old silk factories from export tax and special tax, and issued silk public bonds, with a subsidy of 100 taels of silver per package. As a result, the silk factories resumed operation one after another, reeling old cocoons. For a time, the number of silk factories that resumed operation reached 65. The sales of European and American silk once turned smooth. However, because Japanese silk resumed low-price competition in overseas markets, the sales of Chinese silk in Europe remained sluggish. In addition, at the end of last year, a well-known silk company in New York declared bankruptcy, and the sales of European and American silk universally became cheap, especially Japanese silk. The price of Yokohama Japanese silk fell sharply by 140 to 150 yen, even breaking the standard of 800 yen. Current silk is only opened at 775 yen. As a result, the Shanghai silk market has become even more lifeless. After the New Year, the silk factories have closed down one after another. In addition, the Lunar New Year is approaching, and the customs of the female workers are difficult to change. They all need to take a holiday. Therefore, the number of silk factories that have stopped work has reached eight or nine out of ten. As of yesterday, there are only four or five silk factories in Shanghai that are still finishing their work. They will all stop work and take a holiday tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Industry to Switch to New Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Implementation from January 30th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association notified all members yesterday that they would switch to new weights and measures: "We hereby inform you that the measuring instruments used by our members have been modified according to the styles promulgated by the government and have been inspected by the Municipal Social Bureau and the Metrology Inspection Institute, which verified their accuracy. Each instrument has been stamped for identification. The weighing instruments used have also been purchased new from the Inspection Institute by our members. We have reported to the Municipal Social Bureau and have been approved to switch to the new measuring instruments and weighing instruments in the north and south markets from January 30th of this year. Except for the scales, which will be changed to the new system at the same time as the Jianghai Customs due to foreign trade relations, all old measuring instruments and weighing instruments used in the past will be abolished. This is to notify all parties, and if the old measuring instruments and weighing instruments are still used, or those that have not been inspected and stamped, they will be punished according to law once they are found. Please do not delay or mistake yourself. This is to notify all."</p>
<h3>Traces of Contemporary Figures</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, Chu Minyi, Liu Ruiheng, and others traveled out of Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai night train the night before last and arrived in Shanghai together at 8:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Closes for Account Settlement for Four Days</h3>
<p>From the 26th to the 29th</p>
<p>Both Associations Have Approved the Resolution</p>
<p>The general closing period for the business community this year has been determined to be the 25th of this month. The two municipal silver and money associations have resolved to close for accounting purposes from the 26th to the 29th and to reopen for business as usual on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Discharged Employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Petition for Reinstatement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is actively laying off redundant employees to reduce expenses due to financial difficulties. On the 16th of this month, it ordered the layoff of 101 employees from the five warehouses. The discharged employees were all indignant at the sudden dismissal by the Bureau and organized a petitioning group to repeatedly request the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to explain the reasons for the layoff and demand reinstatement of all employees, but to no avail. Furthermore, opinions among the employees were divided, so they did not formally submit a letter explaining the reasons. Yesterday afternoon, about 30 of the discharged employees gathered at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, seeking to see the directors, but yesterday was Saturday afternoon, and the Bureau was not working. Furthermore, none of the directors were responsible. The employees waited for a long time and did not see any directors arrive at the Bureau. They then called all the executive directors, but none of them were at home. They had no choice but to disperse around 5:00 PM, declaring that they would go to the Bureau again next Monday to sit and wait, and would bring bedding and food to stay at the Bureau. While the employees were waiting at the Bureau, they complained incessantly. In summary, there were three reasons: (1) The central government ordered industrial institutions throughout the country to accommodate as many unemployed people as possible in order to stabilize society; (2) The Three Principles of the People of the Premier are based on the people's livelihood, but the Bureau's severance of the livelihoods of the majority of small employees violates the posthumous instructions; (3) The Bureau does not actively seek to expand and increase operations, but rather uses financial difficulties to increase social unrest, which is inconsistent with the central government's principle of resisting foreign aggression and securing domestic stability. Some radical individuals even declared that they would organize a hunger strike to show their determination.</p>
<h3>Director of the Maritime Bureau, Zhu Yaoting, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Appointed Wan Huiyi as Supervisor</p>
<p>Chen Yici and Yu Shifan Appointed as Section Chiefs</p>
<p>He Hanlan, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, had previously submitted his resignation. Zhu Yaoting, the First Section Chief of the Zhejiang Construction Department, was appointed by the Ministry to succeed him. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday to take over. The handover is detailed below:</p>
<p>Handover Ceremony: The new Director of the Shanghai Maritime Bureau, Zhu Yaoting, arrived in Shanghai to discuss handover procedures with He Hanlan after receiving the Ministry's order, and set the 21st as the date to take office. Director He had already instructed all sections to prepare for the handover. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., Zhu Yaoting, accompanied by Chen Yici, Yu Shiying, and Wan Yaoyi, the supervisor from the Ministry of Transportation, arrived at the Maritime Bureau at No. 6 Sichuan Road. Former Director He welcomed them in. After a brief rest, they were led into a temporary hall in the reception room. Director He first gathered all the staff from the first and second sections, and after the formalities, Director He began by stating that since taking office, he had started to organize maritime affairs and was beginning to see progress. He regretted that the time was too short to achieve his goals. He said that in his past work, he had done his best to fulfill his duties with integrity. After his speech, new Director Zhu Yaoting held the inauguration ceremony. Former Director He handed over the seals, documents, and public funds to the new director and then withdrew.</p>
<p>Director's Address: After taking office, new Director Zhu Yaoting issued an address. He first stated that former Director He was a specialist in maritime affairs, and the Shanghai Maritime Bureau had achieved obvious results under his leadership, which were worthy of emulation. He himself had served as the First Section Chief and concurrently as a technical expert in the Zhejiang Construction Department, and had also managed the provincial ship office in Zhejiang Province. Although the scope was smaller, the nature was the same. He said that he was deeply willing to follow the norms set by Director He, continue to work hard on reform, and make the maritime administration achieve the hope of rejuvenation. He said that all those in the bureau who were familiar with the situation of their duties were people he still needed to rely on, and he ordered them to continue to serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>Committee Member's Supervision: The Ministry of Transportation specially appointed Wan Huiyi, Section Chief of the Maritime Affairs Department, to come to Shanghai to supervise the handover from Director He to the new Director Zhu, and to represent the Minister in administering the oath-taking ceremony for Director Zhu. After the handover was completed, Wan delivered an address, expressing his hope that maritime affairs would be reformed and gradually achieve the recovery of maritime rights.</p>
<p>Appointment of Section Chiefs: The Maritime Bureau's organization is divided into only two sections. The original First Section Chief, Lu Esheng, and the Second Section Chief, Wu Daming, also submitted their resignations after He Hanlan resigned. Yesterday, the new Director approved them and immediately announced the appointments of Chen Yici as the First Section Chief and Yu Shifan as the Second Section Chief. Yu Shiying was appointed as Secretary. Chen Yici sent staff to take over the accounting and general affairs sections first, while Yu Shifan took over the technical section. At 12:00, the telegrams of He Hanlan's resignation and Director Zhu's inauguration were sent to the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Dr. Lowe, Agricultural Advisor to the Ministry of Industries, Submits a Memorial to Minister Chen</h3>
<p>Major Plan to Develop Chinese Agriculture</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Dr. Lowe, Agricultural Advisor to the Ministry of Industries, has drafted a major plan to develop Chinese agriculture, which was submitted to Minister Chen Gongbo several weeks ago. Dr. Lowe believes that China urgently needs a major plan to develop agriculture. It is estimated that the nation spends no less than 600 million yuan annually on imports of cotton, rice, wheat, flour, etc., plus 300 million yuan on imported cotton textiles, totaling approximately 900 million yuan annually. If a comprehensive plan for agricultural development can be implemented quickly within the limits of talent and financial resources, then these goods would no longer need to be imported, and this 900 million yuan could remain in the country. Dr. Lowe's plan covers all agricultural issues in detail. For the sake of administrative economy, all plans are summarized into four major groups: agricultural production, animal husbandry, agricultural economics and marketing, and agricultural experiment institutions. All work in these four groups is devoted to research, promotion, and inspection, with particular emphasis on research and experimentation, and the results are provided to farmers through promotional agencies. Under the agricultural production item, work is divided into crops, vegetables and fruits, forestry, soil science, tree diseases, and entomology. Under animal husbandry, it is divided into sericulture, poultry surveys, pig surveys, other livestock surveys, fisheries, animal diseases, and entomology, with special attention to sericulture. Under agricultural economics and marketing, there are farm management techniques, marketing, rural finance, general agricultural issues, rural institutions, and harvest reports. Regarding agricultural experiment institutions, it is advocated that the national government establish a central agricultural experiment station and establish provincial experiment stations in each province, which would be supervised by the central experiment station. The purpose of establishing the central agricultural experiment station is to investigate and organize national agricultural research and experimentation, and to provide appropriate supervision in terms of planning and work, in order to avoid duplication and save unnecessary waste. Although its planning covers all important national agricultural technologies, it is divided into categories, and each category is further divided into detailed items. A portion can be undertaken first within the scope of talent and financial resources, but this plan must be adopted in its entirety in order to achieve the effect of linkage and mutual assistance.</p>

<h3>Over a Hundred Groups Support Fasting on January 28 to Help Fund the Military</h3>
<p>The painful history of the January 28th Shanghai Battle is almost unprecedented. Since the 26th District Branch of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Associations and the Jiangxi Road Business Community Association initiated the "One Meal of Fasting" for the January 28th anniversary, over a hundred groups, including the district branches of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Associations, have unanimously supported this proposal. The following is a special announcement to all citizens: (Titles omitted) Japanese ambitions are to invade, the three northeastern provinces have fallen, and they have further occupied Yu Guan. The people of the whole country are trying to resist the enemy. The only practical method is to resist with all our strength, and it is especially necessary to strengthen military needs in order to fight for the survival of the nation. At this last gasp, we would rather be war ghosts who die for our country than slaves after it is lost. Everyone should do their best to show their duty as a citizen, and rise up together to kill the enemy and save our country. As the first anniversary of January 28th approaches, the people of Shanghai still have lingering pain. We should commemorate it every week to make a full expression, in order to alert the people and never forget. Yesterday, we read that the 26th District Branch of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Associations and the Jiangxi Road Business Community Association initiated the "One Meal of Fasting" for the January 28th anniversary to donate to the military or to build aircraft. We express our deep sympathy for this action, wholeheartedly support it, and proceed with it together. This is an innovative act, and a proper method should be discussed. In addition to sending letters to the competent authorities, we ask all the people of Shanghai to convey this message to every household, so that they can express their sincere desire to save the country with the funds saved from one meal. Shanghai is a culturally advanced area, and every move is related to the whole country. If it can be promoted to all regions, and the whole country fasts together, then it will be easy to raise millions of dollars. If we have the appropriate armaments, no matter how fierce the pirates are, they will not be difficult to annihilate. We have enough food and clothing and live in a comfortable place, but we do not feel the misery of those who live in the ice and snow. We must know that we are fighting for the glory and survival of the Chinese nation. We hope that everyone will act according to their conscience and take action quickly. The 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 15th, 18th, 29th, 30th, 31st and other district branches of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation of Trade Associations, and the business community federations of Henan Road, Wuma Road, Fujian Road, Shandong Road, Xizang Road, Jiujiang Road, Avenue Edward VII, Avenue de la Marne, Haining Road, Zhejiang Road, Xinzha Road, Beijing Road, Sichuan Road, Broadway, Hanbury Road, 6th Road of Hongkou, 6th Road of Hongkou, 3rd Road of Yangshupu, Avenue Haig, 9th Road, 4th Road of West Shanghai, 9th Road of West Shanghai, 6th Road of South Shanghai, 8th Road of Zhabei, 5th District of North Shanghai, Northeast Cities and other business community federations, and over a hundred other groups.</p>
<h3>Province Approves Postponement of Loan Repayment</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Property Management Office stated that the province's loan still owed 4.5 yuan per stone. The local government has been repaying in installments every year. Now, seeing that the second phase of the land price tax (winter tax) announcement does not mention repayment, the public is alarmed. The district chiefs, local gentry, and farmers in the county have been questioning the office, and the province and county have been informed. It has been approved to repay in installments to alleviate the people's difficulties. Yesterday, the county government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, stating briefly that the province's loan should be repaid in installments. However, due to the flood last year and the impact of the Shanghai war, the budget for the 21st year of the Republic is severely insufficient. Therefore, it has been decided by the Provincial Government Committee to postpone it for one year. The decree is to be followed. In response to the previous report, the county magistrate is hereby ordered to investigate the postponement and inform the Finance Bureau. The county government has sent a letter to the property office for reference.</p>
<h3>Donations from All Sectors to Support the Anti-Japanese Soldiers and Refugees</h3>
<p>Postal Workers' Union: Initiated a free donation campaign to postal colleagues in this district to raise comfort money to purchase suitable items to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers at the front. Donors have been very enthusiastic in recent days. It is estimated that from the 17th of this month to yesterday (21st), about 1,000 yuan has been donated. 500 yuan was remitted yesterday through the Shanghai Bank to the Hebei Postal Workers' Union to purchase comfort items nearby and forward them to the front. It is also reported that this comfort donation will be raised on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Lijiao Joint Association: Yesterday, we received a quick mail letter from Mr. Zhu Qinglan of the Liaojihei People's Support Association, which opened with the following words: "Greetings, we have just received 200 yuan from the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank to be donated to the Northeast refugees. We have received the full amount and are deeply grateful for your enthusiasm in supporting and benefiting the disaster victims. We will promptly distribute the funds to promote benevolence. On behalf of the affected compatriots, we express our heartfelt gratitude. A receipt is enclosed, please check and file it for future reference."</p>
<p>China United Shipping Company: Sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which read, "Greetings, we are pleased to read in the newspaper that your association is promoting the saving of spring wine expenses and transferring the funds to help Northeast refugees. The colleagues of the company deeply sympathize and send 100 yuan of spring wine expenses to be collected and transferred to the Northeast of Shanghai to provide relief to the affected compatriots. It is deeply hoped."</p>
<h3>Nisshin's Yangtze River Shipping Cannot Be Restored</h3>
<p>Xiangyang Maru's Resumption of Navigation Again Hit by the Yu Guan Incident</p>
<p>Since Japanese goods have been implementing a dumping policy in the Yangtze River area of our country, the business of Nisshin Steamship Company's Yangtze River class has gradually improved, and Xiangyang Maru has resumed sailing. Recently, due to the Yu Guan incident, it has suffered a major blow. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resumption of Xiangyang: After the September 18th Incident, the business of Nisshin Steamship Company, which mainly operated the Yangtze River class, was affected by the interference of the people of our country, and the ships stopped sailing one after another. The Osaka headquarters repeatedly tried to reduce water freight and lower ticket prices, and used Chinese people to attract customers, exhausting all efforts, but to no avail. Only three ships on the Shanghai-Hankou class, Luoyang, Fengyang, and Nanyang, two ships on the Nanyang class, Songshan and Lushan, two ships on the Beiyang class, Tangshan and Huashan, one ship on the Hankou-Yichang class, and one ship on the Hankou-Changsha class, were barely sailing. The two classes from Yichang to Chongqing and from Changzhou to Changde were completely suspended. Since Japanese goods have been dumped in the Yangtze River area of ​​our country, the business of Nisshin's Yangtze River class has gradually improved. In December of last year, Xiangyang Maru was first resumed.</p>
<p>Again Affected: Since the resumption of Xiangyang Maru, there have been a total of four ships in the Yangtze River class. Most of the business is Japanese transshipment goods. The number of Chinese passengers has gradually increased after the price reduction. The company is preparing to resume Yueyang Maru and others. However, the Yu Guan incident has occurred again. Various business groups in our country have all notified the implementation of the initial intention to resist goods, resulting in a major blow to business and a sharp decline. The four ships that have been barely maintaining sailing on the Yangtze River class in recent days have had few Chinese people on each trip, all of whom are ignorant coolies. Chinese goods have disappeared, and Japanese transshipment goods have also decreased greatly compared with before. The Shanghai branch has telegraphed the headquarters and is trying to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Department of Finance Sends Personnel to Supervise and Urge Road Construction Mu Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government and the Department of Finance ordered that the amount of road construction mu tax that should be remitted to the province by each county should be cleared on a monthly basis according to the regulations. However, many counties have been fatigued. Now, due to the urgent need for funds for the construction of provincial roads, in addition to sending Yu Xinmin to the county to supervise and urge the payment, the county is hereby ordered to prepare the amount of road construction mu tax that should be remitted in accordance with the plan and not delay it again.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Plans to Hold a Special Meeting of Taxpayers</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Issue of Factory Licensing</p>
<p>In order to manage and inspect factories within the concession, the Public Works Department resolved on December 9, 1931, to find a way to convene a special meeting of taxpayers (foreigners) in order to pass the amendment to Section 34 of the Land Regulations (this section stipulates the businesses that should be licensed, and there is no word "factory" in the text). So that the Public Works Department has the power to deal with this matter. Later, due to the situation, it was decided in March of last year to postpone this matter. At the board of directors meeting on January 18 of this year, President Fessenden raised this matter again and stated the agreement he had reached with the former Chairman of the Board and the Chinese authorities on this matter last year. He also said that the Public Works Department had previously decided to invite Miss E.M. Hinder to the bureau to handle matters related to industrial affairs. Miss Hinder has now arrived at the bureau this month and has taken office. She suggested that a special meeting should be held on the day of this year's annual meeting (April 19) to implement the amendment to the attached law. Later, Chairman Bell said that the Carlton Theatre, where the annual meeting was held last time, was not large enough to accommodate the statutory number of people for a special meeting (according to a special meeting, one-third of the taxpayers must attend, that is, about a thousand people). If the new site of the Grand Theatre cannot be used at that time, only the Merchant Corps Parade Ground can be used. This matter needs to be investigated and reported by the Director of Public Works. The board of directors then decided to hold a special meeting of taxpayers on April 19 of this year in order to amend Section 34 of the attached law. If there are other matters that should be resolved at the special meeting, they will also be raised at that time. The text of the amendment will be drafted by the President.</p>
<h3>Tao Jianhua and Others Request Punishment of Ding Shiyuan</h3>
<p>As a Warning to Those Who Sell Their Country for Glory</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports that Tao Jianhua and others sent a letter to the Hu Society and the Huzhou Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association yesterday, saying, "The Hu Society and the Huzhou Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association are respectfully informed that the words and deeds of the rebellious Ding Shiyuan in Tokyo, Japan, and London, England, are absurd and outrageous. Ding, whose courtesy name is Wencha, is 53 years old this year, from Wuxing, Zhejiang. He has served as the Director of the Military Law Department of the Ministry of the Army, the Superintendent of the Jianghan Customs, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hubei, the Director of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Bureau, and the Director of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Bureau. As a Chinese and a senior official of the Republic of China, he is actually a representative of a puppet state, lobbying in various countries, and insulting our country's national character to the extreme. This is tolerable, what is not tolerable? In order to punish traitors who sell their country for glory, we ask you to convene a meeting to (1) deny that the rebellious Ding is a Huzhou person and declare his expulsion; (2) dig up the ancestral tomb of the rebellious Ding in Huzhou; (3) request the court to seal up the property of the rebellious Ding in Huzhou and convert it into a poor people's work-study institute; (4) the rebellious Ding is still the manager of the Tianjin Huiye Bank. Request the court to auction off the shares of the rebellious Ding to open a poor people's factory to save the poor and serve as a warning." Citizens Tao Jianhua, Xu Junruo, and Zeng Yan respectfully submit.</p>
<h3>Baihe River Ice Breaks, National Ships Stop Sailing to North China</h3>
<p>National Ships Do Not Open to Tianjin: In recent days, the weather has been cold, and the Baihe River in Tianjin has been frozen for a long time. However, in the beginning, icebreakers could be used to guide navigation. Since the 17th of this month, the ice within Tanggu has been more than a foot thick, and the Baihe waterway has been completely frozen. After the Xinyuan ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was blocked by ice, it was the last ship to leave Tianjin. This return to Shanghai will stop sailing to North China. It has been notified to the Tianjin customer service to stop collecting passengers and goods to Tianjin. The ship will be diverted to Fuzhou. The Beiyang ships of other companies will also stop sailing to Jin and Gu from today.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Increase Freight Rates: During the time when Baihe River is frozen and Chinese ships stop sailing, the North American class ships of British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson in this port are still dispatching ships. Shanghai has a large number of flour to be transported to Tianjin. Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are still loading them, but after arriving at Tanggu, they will find a way to transport them. The water freight will be increased by a quarter, from 1.2 yuan to 1.6 yuan per ton. Other goods will also be charged additional ice river water freight.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Change to Dalian: The Tianjin class ships of Dalian Steamship Company, a Japanese merchant in this port, have been fixed to leave Tianjin on the 26th of this month. Due to the closure of the port of Baihe, they will no longer go to Tianjin and will temporarily change to Dalian. A notice has been issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wusong Ship Labor Dispute Hearsay Yesterday</h3>
<p>Negotiation Coordination Association Scheduled to Meet Tomorrow</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company Wusong Ship Suffering Fellow Townsmen Negotiation Coordination Association is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow to discuss the method. The two arrested compradors, Tong Chunhua and accountant Hu Henian, were detained by the Public Security Bureau. The cargo handling association sent a letter to the Seamen's Union yesterday to negotiate the rescue. They were released last night. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Tomorrow: The Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Seamen's Special Party Headquarters convened the Shipping Mutual Aid Association and the Seamen's Union to discuss the response.

The association is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow to discuss the response.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Arrested: The two compradors (i.e., cargo handling directors) of Wusong Ship, Tong Chunhua and accountant Hu Henian, were arrested by the Han-Japanese Seamen's Branch and reported to the police authorities because the workers believed that they had instructed hooligans to beat the worker Zhang Yongfu and others. They were escorted by police on the Changxing ship to the city and transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. The new Taikoo Jianghai Ship Cargo Handling Fellow Townsmen Association received letters from the cargo handling directors of various ships requesting them to find a way to rescue Tong Chunhua. Therefore, the association specially sent Qian Hongkun and Yu Dingsheng to negotiate with the Seamen's Union for bail. At the same time, the Shipping Mutual Aid Association also sent Zhang Yanling and Weng Guangda to contact the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau separately to request their release. The Public Security Bureau approved the bail and released them at 6:00 p.m. yesterday. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Yu Makes Mediation: At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Zhang Yanling of the Mutual Aid Association, and Lu Rongzhi and Gao Shuren of the Seamen's Branch, requested Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, to serve as a mediator and find a way to rescue the company. Mr. Yu agreed to negotiate with the Taikoo manager tomorrow (Monday) to find a way to rescue them. (Xin Sheng News Agency)</p>

<h3>Cross-Boundary Road Construction Telephone Case</h3>
<p>French Concession Authorities Suddenly Raise Objections</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the cross-boundary road construction telephone problem has been delayed for more than a year due to various obstacles and has not been resolved. The terms of the contract have long been drafted by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the English translation has also been completed. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession has also understood, and it can be formally signed in the coming days. Unexpectedly, the French Concession authorities suddenly raised objections, creating another twist. The Central News Agency reporter went to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday to inquire about the reason for the French Concession authorities' obstruction. According to Chen Baosheng, section chief of the third section of the bureau, the cross-boundary road construction telephone case has no interest relationship with the French Concession, and it is really puzzling to suddenly raise objections. In order to quickly resolve the case, the bureau has been explaining, and if there is no effect, it will only submit it to the municipal government for handling.</p>

<p>＝The remaining eight criminals are sentenced to imprisonment for various terms＝</p>
<p>＝Lu Wanlin and two others declared innocent＝</p>
<p>Le Baozhen, the owner of Taichang Wood Store on Nanjing Road, was kidnapped by bandits on Yuyuan Road, and a huge ransom was demanded. Later, You A'gen, the chief Chinese detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station, Detective Liu Junqing, and Detective Chen Yonggui rescued Le from a bomb shelter at 911 Haig Road, and arrested 14 kidnappers, including Ma Gengsheng, Hu Hongsheng, Guan Afu, Cao Ziqing, Wang Xiaosizi, Li Youren, Cao Ziyu, Pan Yaoming, Zhang Jindizi, Ren Zixiang, Lu Gaolin, Zhou Jinsheng, Jin Zipei, and a woman named Chen Xushi. Three Mauser pistols, two handguns, a gas pistol, 253 bullets, and a car were seized. It was found that Ma and others had also kidnapped Yang Renshi, the young wife of Sheng Yishao, and demanded a ransom in two cases. They were handed over to the First Special Court for trial. Lu Wanlin hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend him. After interrogation and a final hearing, and after the four houses at 911 Haig Road, 139 Ma'saidillo Road, 39 Gaofu Lane, Saint Mary's Road, and 13 Yuhua Lane, Huishan Road were sealed, the verdict was pronounced yesterday morning. Zhan Jifeng, the lawyer for Lu Wanlin, and Ru Baoyi, the lawyer for the police station, were present on time to hear the verdict. At 9:00 a.m., Qian Changhongye, the head of the criminal division of the Special Court, ascended to the criminal court and announced the verdict. Except for Lu Wanlin, Chen Xushi, and Zhang Jindizi, who were declared innocent, the others were sentenced separately. Ma Gengsheng, Guan Afu, and Ren Zixiang were each sentenced to death, and deprived of their civil rights indefinitely. Jin Zipei, Cao Ziqing, and Wang Xiaosizi were each sentenced to life imprisonment, and deprived of their civil rights indefinitely. Hu Hongsheng was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment, and deprived of his civil rights indefinitely.

If it is inconvenient to keep them, the original items will be auctioned off, and the proceeds will be sent to the court for safekeeping and collection.</p>
<h3>Passengers Openly Kidnapped Next to the Train Station</h3>
<p>Thieves Use Rental Cars</p>
<p>Cash Stolen from Victim</p>
<p>Zhao Jijing, a teacher at Datong University, arrived in Shanghai by train from Wuxi on the 5th of this month. When he exited the station, a rental car parked inside the station solicited business from Zhao, asking for one dollar for transportation to the school. Zhao found it very cheap and hired the car. Unexpectedly, the car was parked at the station by kidnappers specifically to kidnap foreign passengers. Zhao was kidnapped and hidden in a rural hut. The bandits originally planned to kidnap a wealthy merchant from Wuxi, but after repeatedly questioning Zhao, they realized they had kidnapped the wrong person and released him. However, more than 400 dollars in cash were stolen from Zhao, and when he was released, he was blindfolded with a pair of sunglasses and ordered to go to a desolate place and not to look, otherwise they would shoot. Therefore, Zhao was unable to identify the bandits' lair. After this case occurred, the Public Concession police severely cracked down on this type of kidnapper and sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for assistance. Director Wen approved the letter, stating that the kidnappers parked cars in public transportation venues to kidnap passengers. It is said that he has ordered the detective team to step up the investigation.</p>
<h3>Blind Woman Encounters a Villain</h3>
<p>＝Greed Leads to Attempted Murder＝</p>
<p>＝Kidnapping and Theft Ultimately Exposed＝</p>
<p>Zhang Li, a blind woman from Nanshi, had some savings from her late husband. After her husband's death, she cohabitated with Zhang Ziliang. However, Zhang only lived with her for her money. After years of squandering, Zhang had used up several hundred yuan. He also kidnapped and sold her ten-year-old adopted daughter, Lan Ying. Zhang Li then negotiated with Zhang Ziliang, who asked his friend Li Darong to mediate with her, saying that Zhang would use 300 yuan to resolve the matter. Zhang Li immediately agreed and moved to Jin Bao's house on Sanguantang Road, Xieqiao, to await the resolution. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, Li Darong took her to collect the money, and pushed her into the Huangpu River in Yangshupu, intending to kill her, and then fled. After Zhang Li fell into the river, she was fortunately rescued by a boatman, but her forehead was broken. She reported to the police station and was sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. When she returned home the day before yesterday, all the belongings in her house and her five-year-old daughter, Zhang Linbao, had been kidnapped by Li Darong. Zhang Li cried and asked Ma Wu to go with her to the Second District to file a complaint. Fortunately, the detectives captured Li, who confessed that he had sold the child to Chen Dengshi's house in Xiaoshadu. Detectives were immediately sent to bring Chen Dengshi and the child together. The group was presented to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Joint Public Notice from the Two Bureaus Restricting Seats in Public Places</h3>
<p>The Public Security and Public Works Bureaus of this city, with the Lunar New Year approaching, public gathering places in the city are sure to see an increase in visitors. There are often greedy people who set up seats without authorization, which poses a risk of overloading. The two bureaus previously sent staff to inspect and restrict the number of seats. Now, after a long period of time, people have become complacent, and as a result, a joint public notice was issued yesterday, restricting the number of seats in the City God Temple, Yu Garden, tea houses, book halls, and other public places, depending on the size of the building. The public notice is recorded below: "Notice for joint publication. In accordance with the regulations, the Public Security and Public Works Bureaus have previously sent staff to inspect and restrict the number of seats in public gathering places in the city in order to avoid overcrowding and the occurrence of danger. However, it has recently been reported that while some people have complied with the measures restricting the number of people, others have become complacent over time and have sought to profit by setting up seats without authorization, which is in violation of the general provisions and should be severely rectified to ensure safety. Therefore, the number of seats is specifically limited, as stated above. It is hoped that people will strictly abide by the regulations. Anyone who dares to violate them will be severely punished without leniency. This notice is hereby given. Director Wen Hong'en, Shen Yi."</p>
<h3>Neighbor Shouts Fire Alert After Robbery</h3>
<p>＝Fire trucks arrive but are not used＝</p>
<p>＝Robbers Flee During the Shouting＝</p>
<p>At about 7 p.m. the night before last, a siren suddenly sounded in Dachang Lane, Ping'an Bridge, Nanmatou, Nanshi. Residents in the neighborhood panicked and shouted "Fire!" In a moment, they rushed out of their houses with their furniture, causing chaos. The first station of the first district heard of the incident and sent patrol officer Liu Songjian to the scene to maintain order. At the same time, the fire brigades of each district also received reports of a fire and rushed to the scene with their pump trucks. However, there was no fire. Under investigation, it was learned that Wang Fengsheng, a 50-year-old resident of Anhui, who opened Wanhao at the Shanghai military camp and served as the chief of the investigation section in the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau in the two stations, was suddenly visited by four robbers at about 6 p.m. the night before last. All of them spoke in the local dialect. They broke into Wang's house, rushed into the living room, drove the owner and his family to a corner, drew out their pistols, threatened them to remain silent, and had one robber stand guard next to them and one guard the gate. The remaining robbers went straight to the upstairs and searched recklessly. They robbed a small diamond ring, a sapphire ring, and two gold rings, worth more than 100 yuan, and fled with the loot through the back door. A neighbor learned of this and mistakenly thought there was a fire. They blew the whistle wildly and shouted, "Fire!" By the time the robbery was discovered, it had been more than an hour since the robbery. The robbers had already fled far away. The incident was immediately reported to the station chief, who forwarded it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>Wang Jinsheng's Bulging Abdomen</h3>
<h3>18 Pounds of Opium Found</h3>
<p>Gunshots in the Crowd</p>
<p>Li Afu Wounded and Falls to the Ground</p>
<p>Wang Quansheng, a native of Ningbo who traffics in opium, was carrying 18 pounds of opium on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 2:15 PM. While passing by Baifuli near Broadway and Yadong Road, he was accosted by more than ten Japanese ruffians, and they started arguing. Upon hearing the commotion, Huapu Officer No. 1990, Huatanmu Wang Runhe, and Detective Zhang Shoushan from the Hongkou Police Station rushed to the scene. Seeing Wang's bulging abdomen, they immediately arrested him and found the opium on his person. Unexpectedly, someone pulled the Huapu officer's collar from behind, and the rest of the group crowded around and blocked him. In desperation, the Huapu officer drew his gun and fired four shots backward, hitting one person who fell to the ground. The injured person is named Li Afu, a native of Ningbo, 39 years old. The rest of the crowd fled in all directions. Wang was taken to the police station along with the opium, and the head officer ordered him to be detained. Meanwhile, the injured person was taken to the Tongren Hospital and then transferred to the Police Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Wang Quansheng to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the facts of the case, adding that Li Afu was injured in the right arm, buttocks, etc., and was unable to appear in court due to being hospitalized, requesting a postponement. The defendant claimed at the police station that he worked on the "Gonghe" transport ship and planned to take the opium to a certain opium den in the French Concession for sale. Li Afu, the injured party, claimed that he did not know the defendant, was a crew member on the "Pinghe" ship docked at Wusongkou, and was passing by the area when he saw the defendant arguing with the ruffians and tried to mediate. The opium was presented to the court for inspection. Subsequently, Huapu Officer No. 1990 submitted a report admitting to firing four shots in self-defense. Lawyer Ge Zhaoji, representing Li Afu, stated that Li Afu had nothing to do with the opium case, was just passing by when he was shot, and that the Huapu officer should not have fired randomly into the crowd. Judge Zhao Linyu briefly questioned the defendant and ordered him to be remanded in custody pending Li Afu's recovery and further questioning.</p>
<h3>Young Man Attempts Suicide by Poison</h3>

<h3>Male Corpse Found Dead on Dock</h3>

<h3>Hu Xiyuan Discusses the Future of China's Light Bulb Industry</h3>
<p>The recent dumping of Japanese light bulbs has attracted widespread attention. Yesterday, Mr. Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of the China Ya'pu'er Electrical Appliance Factory, discussed the current state of China's light bulb industry, stating that domestic light bulb factories began to emerge around 1920, gradually increasing in number. In 1921, a Cantonese businessman established the Guangya Factory, the largest in scale. There was also the Japanese-owned Bolian Factory, which produced a significant number of bulbs. Unexpectedly, due to competition from foreign light bulb merchants, bulb prices plummeted, and the light bulb factories established in Shanghai successively closed down. Those with strong capital struggled to survive and had to cease operations. 1928 was the most prosperous period for small electric bulbs used in Chinese flashlights. At that time, the cost of small electric bulbs was just over two yuan per hundred, and the market price could be sold for more than four yuan. Therefore, small electric bulb factories sprang up everywhere like mushrooms after rain. Until last year, a large number of Japanese small electric bulbs were imported, priced at only 1.20 yuan per hundred, causing more than 95% of China's small electric bulb factories to close down. To perfect and reduce the cost of electric light bulbs, the cooperation of experts in electrical engineering, chemistry, and mechanics is essential. At the same time, substantial capital is needed to support their operations, and highly experienced personnel must manage them. Scientific management and rationalized production are necessary to achieve high-quality production and low costs, leaving room for survival. Currently, a large number of Japanese bulbs are being imported. Although the government can impose dumping taxes, dumping is not unlimited and must comply with dumping laws to be applicable. If China's light bulb industry is to survive, each factory must work hard on its own. If they rely solely on antidumping measures as a protective shield for their business, without researching the principles of production and reducing costs, and if they start light bulb factories with a speculative nature, they may repeat the disastrous failure of 1922, and the future is not optimistic.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: In your newspaper's report on the bidding for tea and refreshments on passenger trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line of this bureau, published on the 21st of this month, the word "year" in the phrase "annual car rental" should be changed to "month." Please check and correct accordingly. Sincerely, Huang Boqiao, Director of the Jinghu Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, January 21, 1933.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I recently saw in your newspaper, in today's local news section, that Chen Rongcai, a tea server on the Wuchang steamer, escaped with more than 90,000 yuan worth of gold bars brought from Hankou. I was extremely shocked after reading it. After investigation, there is no such person as Chen Rongcai among all the tea servers on our ship. After careful investigation, it was found that Zou Shunjin, who carried the gold, is a staff member of the Wuchang steamer's public affairs office. Chen Rongcai, who escaped, is Zou's delivery partner, that is, the public affairs office's errand boy. This matter concerns the reputation of all the tea servers on our ship, so I have submitted a special letter requesting you to correct it as soon as possible. I am extremely hopeful. With best regards to the great editor of the Shenbao. Sincerely, All Tea Servers of the Taikoo Wuchang Steamer, January 21.</p>

<h3>Academics and Schools</h3>
<p>| Mr. Jianming's Letter |</p>
<p>I am a student about to graduate from high school, only eighteen years old this year, seemingly a youth capable of great achievements. However, when I graduated from elementary school, my grades were also very good, but due to a momentary lapse in judgment, I mistakenly entered a cramped junior high school, and also became a commuter student, so I wasted three precious years in idle living. Now, thinking back on it in the quiet of the night, I feel nothing but regret! I regret having taken the wrong path, and I hate my own ignorance. But when it came time to graduate, my ranking in the exams was still in the top ten. Is this because everyone else was just muddling through? Later, I tried to apply to high school, but I was rejected the first time. It was only then that I felt my own learning and knowledge were insufficient, but it was too late for regrets, and I could only sigh in vain. Finally, I actually got into a provincial high school, which made me very happy and comforted. So, in the few years of high school, I worked very hard, and I could be considered one of the top students in the whole school. Time flies like an arrow, and now there are only six months left until graduation. So, a difficult hurdle is approaching before me. (That is, the two diverging paths of further education and employment lie before the general high school student.) As far as my aspirations are concerned, I very much want to pursue further education, to gain deeper knowledge and develop a sound personality. Now there are two difficult problems swirling in my mind…</p>
<p>㈠ Will going to university really increase our students' knowledge, learning, and character? Most of the universities these days (private ones) are mostly just diploma mills. As long as you pay the fees in full, you don't even have to attend classes. You can go to the movies or go dancing every day. The situation inside the school is truly chaotic and full of shameful behavior. This not only fails to gain knowledge and learning, but also taints a pure personality, only to add a consumer to society, and in the future, they will not be able to improve the country, but instead push the country closer to the path of destruction! Even national universities are often plagued by turmoil, making such a fuss that it's impossible to concentrate on studying. Perfection is ultimately rare, so going to university is very dangerous. My views are very narrow, and I don't know if this is really the case?</p>
<p>㈡ How to manage the expenses for further education? My family is already struggling to provide my tuition fees, but other expenses will have to be cut back. Moreover, my father is already over fifty years old. He is suffering for his son, and I can't bear it, even though I am the only child. Thinking this way, after graduating from high school, should I look for a job and start life as a warrior in society? (My mother often advises me in this way as well.) I am now worried about my future, wandering at the crossroads of life, and with my views being so immature, it is easy for me to fall. So now I especially ask a learned gentleman to point out a path of light for a lost lamb, so as to avoid his downfall.</p>
<p>Reply: Regarding the two points you asked in your letter, I respectfully reply as follows: ㈠ Regarding the school selection for further education. Diploma-mill universities are indeed slovenly, but aren't national schools also slovenly? If we calmly and quietly criticize them, we can say that they "each have their strengths and weaknesses," but we can also say that they are "not good products," because the advantages of national schools are: (1) More ample funding, (2) Relatively more professors, among whom there are more with specialized knowledge (naturally, this is only relative), (3) More complete reference books and experimental equipment. However, they also have their disadvantages. The faculty and staff of universities are close to the government, and their bureaucratic tendencies are too strong. Even if there are one or two enlightened people, they are in an environment of universal conformity, and there is no possibility of freely developing independent theories. If you want to be a county magistrate or a judge, then you must enter the political science and law department of a national university. If you want to be an engineer, then you must enter the engineering department of a national university. If you want to do research in ordinary social sciences (bourgeois social sciences), then you can also enter the sociology department of a national university. But if you really want to study social sciences based on dialectical materialism, then you don't need to bother asking about it, because they don't sell such goods there. If you go, it will definitely be a waste of effort. As for diploma-mill universities, naturally most of them are trying to cheat people out of money, engaging in empty transactions. However, if you carefully investigate, you may find some fairly good diploma-mill universities. If you come across such a diploma-mill university, then you will see that it has the following characteristics: (1) Some of its professors are full of novel ideas, (2) Its academic atmosphere does not carry much bureaucratic stench, (3) Its teaching materials are relatively free, (4) Students have more opportunities for free discussion. These advantages are not easily obtained in national schools. In the reporter's humble opinion, the future academic atmosphere must rely on good private universities to salvage it. National schools only cultivate some conformist talents, or perhaps a few geniuses may emerge from there, but that is not due to their educational power, but rather to social causes. You believe that those who "cannot improve the country, but instead push the country closer to the path of destruction" must be private university students, namely diploma-mill university students, but that is not necessarily the case! ㈡ Regarding your financial problems for further education. Since your family can "barely provide your tuition fees," then that is not a problem. Even if your family "reduces some other expenses," and your father is only your only son, then naturally he would be willing. If you really feel sorry for your father, then reduce your living expenses even more. Besides the necessary tuition and board fees and necessary book fees, don't take a penny from home. Fortunately, universities are relatively free, and you can still write articles and submit them to newspapers, or do some work for others. Japanese university students sell newspapers in the morning, and American university students wash dishes in restaurants in the evening. They can all earn a few coins to subsidize their expenses, and also take this opportunity to learn more about the life of the poor and get to know the true situation of poor people's lives. Then, on the one hand, you can earn money, and on the other hand, you can also put into practice the maxim of "going to the people." If you really want to live the life of a warrior in society, then you can fight anytime and anywhere, and everywhere is a battlefield. So, muster up your courage. You don't have to look for a job to "start." Our life is struggle. Without "struggle," life has no meaning. What do you think?</p>
<p>A Word to Mr. Wang Yangshan: Your letter has been forwarded to your son. Please provide your address so that we can discuss by correspondence. If publication is possible, it will still be published in this column.</p>

For members such as those in Wujiang County who have not submitted the second semester reports, they will be given a lenient reprimand and ordered to submit the required number of reports for review within ten days of receiving the cable. Failure to comply will result in severe punishment. As for the inspection reports for the 21st year, it is said that the order remains the same as before, with the bureau submitting the reports to the department for review within one month after the end of each semester, and no delays will be tolerated.</p>

<h3>U.S. Department of Labor Issues New Order Prohibiting Foreign Students from Working Part-Time</h3>
<p>Chinese Ministry of Education Responds to Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Refuting the Order</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on a report from the Consulate General in New York, submitted a request to the Ministry of Education regarding the U.S. Department of Labor's promulgation of a new order prohibiting foreign students from working part-time, the Ministry of Education immediately consulted for a reply. Yesterday (the 20th), the Ministry of Education replied, "The Ministry has already formulated a unified policy on studying abroad, strictly dispatching those on government scholarships, and intends to raise the qualifications for private students, so as to ensure that those who go abroad to study are all going for advanced academic research and will no longer seek employment outside of their studies. Although the new order of the U.S. Department of Labor will not have a significant impact on Chinese students studying in the U.S., the cancellation of part-time work, the payment of security deposits, and the restriction on the length of study for foreign students are contrary to the spirit of international cultural cooperation and conflict with equal treaties. Furthermore, students receiving scholarship awards and loan scholarships are purely the result of academic efforts, and such rewards should not be restricted. Therefore, it seems appropriate to state the reasons for the above points to the U.S. government." The details of the U.S. Department of Labor's prohibition of foreign students from working part-time and its impact on Chinese students studying in the U.S. are described as follows:</p>
<p>The U.S. Secretary of Labor announced on September 26th of last year an order to cancel the right of foreign students to work part-time, which has aroused fierce opposition from the U.S. education community. According to the interpretation of the new order, foreign students in the U.S. who are allowed to enter the country under the non-immigrant quota of the immigration law must prove that they have sufficient financial preparation and reliable guarantees to maintain their student life and identity. Regardless of whether foreign students are already in the U.S. or will be allowed to enter the U.S. in the future, if they engage in extracurricular business or domestic service for profit or compensation, the immigration authorities will consider them to have lost their student status, and they may be arrested and deported. Furthermore, after a foreign student is allowed to enter the U.S., there must be a fixed number of years, and when the limit is reached, they must leave the country, regardless of whether their studies have been completed. (Previously, foreign students in the U.S. who were indeed attending school in accordance with the regulations were not subject to any length restrictions.) Furthermore, starting from October 1st, the Department of Labor authorized each open immigration bureau to require foreign students coming to the U.S., if the situation is deemed "suspicious," to pay a security deposit of US$500 before being allowed to enter the country. After the promulgation of the new order, the U.S. education community opposed it fiercely. The Department of Labor's attitude has slightly softened. According to a letter from Harry E. Hall, Director of the General Immigration Bureau of the Department of Labor, to Dr. John H. MacCracken of the Education Association, the degree of restriction in the Department of Labor's regulations prohibiting foreign students from working has been slightly modified. Foreign students who were already allowed to enter the country before August 1932, if they are indeed attending school in accordance with the regulations, are allowed to continue working, but their compensation is limited to room and board and they may not receive wages. They are also allowed to continue working during vacations, but it is still limited to maintaining room and board. Furthermore, foreign students who entered the U.S. in August 1932 are allowed to receive scholarship awards or loan scholarships. According to statistics from the Universal Education Association, there are currently approximately 5,000 foreign students in the U.S., including 1,300 from China, 1,000 from Japan, 500 from Russia, 400 each from the United Kingdom and Germany, 200 each from Italy and India, 150 from France, 125 from Korea, and 100 each from Scotland, Ireland, Panama, and Switzerland, 70 each from Sweden and South Africa, and 20 from Wales. Furthermore, according to statistics from the Immigration Bureau, from June 30, 1929, to July 31, 1922, a total of 4,716 foreign students were allowed to enter the U.S. According to estimates from various parties, the number of foreign students affected by the new regulations is over 1,500.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the new order, public opinion has been quite opposed, and the education community has been particularly fierce. University presidents and individuals in the education community have sent letters and telegrams and broadcast speeches on the radio opposing the order. It is reported that the career services departments of Columbia University in New York and Harvard University in Boston are continuing to provide introductions to foreign students and have not strictly followed the new order. Based on this situation, the implementation of this new order prohibiting foreign students from working may not be very smooth. However, in reality, the U.S. is currently experiencing an economic downturn and high unemployment. It is not easy for American students to find part-time work, and the difficulties for foreign students in the U.S. are even more evident. As far as Chinese students studying in the U.S. are concerned, there are more than 1,300 students in public and private universities and specialized schools throughout the U.S. Except for students from Tsinghua University and those dispatched by the Central Party Headquarters who do not have economic problems, most of the students on provincial government scholarships cannot remit their tuition fees on time. As for private students, except for a portion, most have experienced economic difficulties in the past two years due to the decline in the price of silver and have had to seek work outside of their studies to make up for the shortfall. The implementation of the new order will have a significant impact. It is found that Chinese students studying in the U.S. had two different statuses before the new order was promulgated: (1) Students who came to the U.S. before 1924. There are still quite a few of them in the U.S., and most of them have already graduated and have decent jobs to support themselves. The Immigration Bureau has always adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards these students and has not inquired about them. After the promulgation of this new order, it is not clear whether it will affect these students. (2) Students who came to the U.S. after the implementation of the new immigration law in 1924. The restrictions have always been very strict, and this new order is actually targeted at these students. After the promulgation and implementation of this new order, there are also several points that will affect future Chinese students studying in the U.S.: (1) They will not be able to receive scholarship awards and loan scholarships. It is found that quite a few Chinese students studying in the U.S. have previously received assistance from public and private scholarship awards or loan scholarships. After the implementation of the new order, they will not be able to enjoy this right. (2) They must pay a security deposit for entry. The new order authorizes each immigration bureau at the port of entry to require foreign students coming to the U.S., if they are deemed suspicious, to pay a security deposit of US$500 before being allowed to enter the country. Although it does not order all students coming to the U.S. to pay the deposit, the Immigration Bureau usually interprets regulations broadly, and is particularly strict towards Eastern Asians. In the future, Chinese students studying in the U.S., except for government-sponsored students dispatched by the government whom the Immigration Bureau cannot refuse, must prepare sufficient security deposits to prevent difficulties upon entry. (3) Length restrictions. The new order stipulates the number of years that students can stay in the U.S. The student declares this themselves upon entry or it is noted on their passport. However, once it is stipulated, it cannot be extended. Even if the student has not completed their studies when the term expires, they may have to leave the country. (4) No work opportunities. After the new order is promulgated, Chinese students will have no opportunities to work, which is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Opportunity to study. The internal setup includes basic and clinical departments. The basic department temporarily establishes a Department of Biochemistry, scheduled to open on February 15th. The clinical department is setting up Internal Medicine, Tuberculosis, Dermatology and Venereology, Orthopedics, and Obstetrics and Gynecology departments, scheduled to open on March 1st.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Seventh Primary School Teacher Registration</h3>
<p>Physical Examination and Oral Examination to Be Conducted Tomorrow and the Day After</p>
<p>The registration for the seventh Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's primary school teacher registration has closed yesterday.

Male teachers with numbers from 401 to 600 and female teachers with numbers from 101 to 200 and 601 to 700 will report for the oral examination and physical examination the day after tomorrow (the second day).

<h3>Provincial Shanghai High School Donates to Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Provincial Shanghai High School in this city is extremely excited about the loyalty and bravery of the Northeast Volunteer Army in resisting the enemy. This semester, all teachers, students, and school staff have tightened their belts and saved money to collect a donation of 1,040 yuan and 88 fen for the Northeast Volunteer Army. Yesterday, it was sent to the Xinhua Bank to be forwarded to the Volunteer Army Support Association, which will then forward it to the Northeast Volunteer Army. It is reported that on memorial days such as September 18th, the entire school only had one vegetable soup per table. Therefore, although the school's donation is not very large, its meaning is extraordinarily profound.</p>

<h3>Mai Ling Defeats Zhen Ru</h3>
<p>46 to 36</p>
<p>Tongji Wins Against Jianhua by One Point</p>
<p>Seven Hujiang Teams Tonight May Need to Be Postponed</p>
<p>There were dramatic battles in both Group A matches of the Shanghai Basketball Association last night. The match between Mai Ling and Zhen Ru was particularly interesting. Mai Ling, with its excellent coordination and agile passing, finally defeated Zhen Ru 46 to 36. The match between Tongji and Jianhua was quite tense. In the end, Tongji won by only one point, with a score of 39 to 38. The two Group A matches tonight are expected to be spectacular. The schedule is as follows: (Note: Most of the Hujiang players have left Shanghai, and the team must be reorganized and renamed Donghua, but it may not be able to play tonight and must be postponed.)</p>

<h3>Tongji Defeats Jianhua by One Point</h3>
<p>In a battle of evenly matched forces, tension was inevitable. Last night's first match between Tongji and Jianhua saw both sides making gains, and it was difficult to tell who would win. The score went from 2-2 all the way to 16-16. Sometimes Tongji had the upper hand, sometimes Jianhua surged ahead. It was a dragon-horse, tiger-lion fight, neither side willing to yield. However, after 16 points, Tongji suddenly took the lead, and from then on, Jianhua trailed behind. Nevertheless, by the end of the first half, Tongji was only ahead by two points, the score being 22-20. As the second half began, the situation remained the same. Although Jianhua fought hard, they had no opportunity to overtake. Tongji once led by 32-26, this mere six-point difference being the largest margin in the match. Later, Jianhua strove to advance and scored repeatedly, once bringing the score to 39-38, with Tongji leading by only one point. It seemed Jianhua would soon emerge victorious, but that moment never came. In the end, Tongji won by a single point.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Suffers Crushing Defeat to Mailing</h3>
<p>In the second match, Mailing displayed a free-flowing and excellent performance. Zhenru's (Jinan University) basketball skills had improved significantly after two months of hard work with Xiqing. With some leniency from the referees, Zhenru started off smoothly. Xu Rongshui and Han Zhenyuan scored two baskets in a row, taking an early lead of four points. Mailing's Mao Leigen and Bo Long followed with four points each. Zhenru's Huang Han then added two more points. However, from that point on, Mailing's spirit was roused, and their momentum became fierce. They had a significant advantage due to their tall stature. After a score of 10-10, Zhenru was at a disadvantage and struggled to shine. Mailing's passes were quick, and their shots were accurate. Mailing won the first half with a score of 26-18. In the next twenty minutes, Zhenru initially offered resistance. Yin Guiren and Wang Nanzhen guarded fiercely. After Gen Bo scored a basket for Mailing, they failed to increase their score for five minutes. Zhenru then scored five points in a row. Afterwards, both sides exchanged two baskets, and then Mailing's brilliance reappeared. Zhenru was trapped by the tight defense and unable to perform. Huang Zhaolin and Xu Rongshui's long-range shots bounced off the rim of the basket, missing by a hair's breadth. Mailing sailed smoothly, adding as many as twelve points. In the end, Mailing won with a score of 46-30.</p>

<h3>Gradually Revealing True Skills</h3>
<p>Military Academy Basketball Team Defeats St. John's by a Large Margin</p>
<p>| 48 to 28 Points |</p>
<p>Li Gongyu's Wonderful Baskets Receive Full Court Applause</p>
<p>The Players Are Becoming More Familiar With the Court and Have Improved Greatly Compared to the Previous Night</p>
<p>There Will Be a Fierce Battle Tomorrow Night Against Xiqing Pirates</p>
<p>The Central Military Academy basketball team defeated St. John's by a large margin of 48-28 at the Xiqing basketball hall last night. This was the Military Academy's second match in Shanghai. The team made their debut the night before and lost to Shanghai Industrial School due to unfamiliarity with the court. Last night, they gradually entered a better state and displayed their prowess. Many of their beautiful plays were praised. The Military Academy will battle the Xiqing Pirates tomorrow night.</p>
<h3>Entering a Better State</h3>
<p>The Military Academy's performance last night was a great improvement over the previous night, restoring their original condition. Their left forward, Li Gongyu, who has the most accurate shots and the nimblest movements, made many wonderful baskets. His accuracy and beauty were indescribable. The two guards were also unyielding. The team's cooperation also improved greatly in the second half. Their passing and movement were very coordinated. From this, it can be known that the last two matches will be even more spectacular. It is a pity that the team lacks a center. Huang Jianding is relatively weak. If they could get a strong center, the team's strength would be increased a hundredfold.</p>
<h3>Sailing Smoothly</h3>
<p>St. John's was formed by combining two teams, one from a university and one from a middle school. Although the middle school team is good, they lack experience. Li Gongyu and Wang Shixuan each scored two baskets for the Military Academy, taking an early lead of 8-2. St. John's substituted Zhou Xuexian, and indeed, Zhou and Cheng Jingxing also scored three baskets, tying the score at 8-8. However, Gao Lingzhao and Huang Jianding added another seven points, and from then on, the Military Academy sailed smoothly. St. John's trailed by six or seven points, and at 20-12, Cheng Jingxing made two beautiful shots, recovering four points. At the end of the first half, the Military Academy won by 24-16.</p>
<h3>Fighting More Bravely</h3>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the Military Academy's five players fought more bravely, smashing St. John's defense. They scored basket after basket, adding ten points in a row, making the score 34-17, a difference of twice as much. Li Gongyu made every shot he took, and the Military Academy's momentum grew stronger. St. John's trailed by about twenty points. The final result was 48-28.</p>
<h3>Pirates Watching</h3>
<p>Last night, members of the Pirates team, such as Smith and Pi Lei, watched the battle from the sidelines, studying the strengths and weaknesses of the Military Academy in order to prepare for their match on Monday night. They all said that their shooting accuracy was astonishing, their center was somewhat weak, and their guards were strong. They constantly discussed how to deal with them, and it is known that their hearts must have been pounding.</p>

<h3>The Intense Luminosity of a Meteor</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In the past, the Netherlands saw a meteor like a ball of fire, illuminating the night as if it were day. As it flew, it sounded like thunder, and it disappeared into the North Sea. Recently, a meteor was also discovered in Wuzhou, Guangxi. Its luminosity was so intense that it was rarely seen, and it had a long, sweeping tail of light, like an enlarged "Nine Dragons Drawing Water" firework. It flew straight to the center of the city, gradually disintegrated, and disappeared! Where did that intense luminosity go in an instant?</p>
<p>"Half black, it still has bones; completely red, it has already turned to ashes." This is a poem by an ancient person describing the exhaustion of charcoal, and it implies that luminosity should not be too intense. If this star only emitted a faint glimmer in the sky, it could permanently maintain its position in the sky. How could it disintegrate and disappear? Its disintegration and disappearance were only because it was going mad. It demonstrated its intense luminosity to the people, stimulating their eyes and preventing them from looking directly at it.</p>
<p>A star with excessive luminosity is a mad star. A country with excessive luminosity is a mad country. Why did Napoleon, the French Emperor of the 19th century, and Wilhelm, the German Emperor of the 20th century, ultimately fail? It was because they wanted to demonstrate their intense luminosity to the people of the world, stimulating the eyes of the people of the world and preventing them from looking directly at them.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>— He Ruo</p>
<p>National shame days number in the dozens, and more are still being created.</p>
<p>Forty thousand square miles of land were lost in one night, along with thirty million people.</p>
<p>Protests and diplomatic notes can resist Japan's sea, land, and air forces.</p>
<p>It is expected that the League of Nations will take the lead, the American navy will be on the right flank, and the Soviet Russian army will be on the left flank to defeat Japan and regain the three northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>Even after a city is reduced to scorched earth, one can still enjoy a cup of wine with the enemy. While the national army is at war with the enemy country, the navy can still maintain strict neutrality.</p>
<p>Chinese soldiers are also politicians, diplomats, lawyers, and X and X. In short, they are "omnipotent."</p>
<h3>To the Road of Depravity</h3>
<p>— Wu Hezhou</p>
<p>| What Ruined Her? |</p>
<p>A friend, Mr. Bai, had a neighbor in the front building who employed a maid. This maid was very young and was hired as a "young nanny." She was from Changshu and seemed to have arrived in Shanghai not long ago. She dressed very plainly and had a very honest demeanor. She seemed to be diligent in her work, and it was said that her employers trusted her very much.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Three months later, this Changshu "young nanny" suddenly resigned from her job.</p>
<p>The reason was unknown.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>One day, Bai happened to meet this Changshu "young nanny" at the West Gate tram station. Oh! She had changed. Originally a "country bumpkin," she had now transformed into a "modern woman." This was evident from her dress and demeanor. She had a perm, a tight-fitting cheongsam, and the curves that are needed to be called "pretty" by the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Another day, Bai was at the Tianyun Tea House. This place can be said to be a "gathering place" for female waitresses. Unintentionally, he (Bai) discovered that the Changshu "young nanny" was working there.</p>
<p>Making flirty eyes, acting provocatively, telling jokes, laughing wildly... she let customers have their way. She was now "completely different" from what she used to be.</p>
<p>On the road to depravity.</p>
<p>What ruined her?</p>
<h3>Poetic Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>| A Few Heroic Poems |</p>
<p>"Yue Wumu's Manjianghong": The shame of Jingkang is still unavenged; the subjects' hatred, when will it end? I will drive my chariot, crushing the Helan Mountains! The brave will feast on barbarian flesh when hungry, laugh and drink Xiongnu blood when thirsty, and when I have reclaimed our old lands, I will pay homage at the Imperial Palace!</p>
<p>The rampant brutality of the Rising Sun is no different from the Jurchens. In this vast land, how many Yue Fei's are there? How many Qin Huis? And the heroes like Su, Ma, Ding, and Li have all retreated into Soviet Russia. Who will "feast on barbarian flesh when hungry, drink Xiongnu blood when thirsty?" The Jurchens will eventually be defeated, and the fall of the land can be expected. But who will reclaim our old lands?</p>
<p>"Lu Fangweng's Poem for His Son": When I die, I know that all will be empty, but I grieve that I will not see the Nine Provinces united. When the royal army reconquers the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice!</p>
<p>Fangweng lived in a turbulent time and knew that the Southern Song Dynasty could not recover its lost territories, so he had these poignant words. A kind of patriotism overflows from his words. I believe that everyone will die, but it is better to die on the battlefield than under a window. This is what is meant by "all will be empty." But I grieve that I will not see the Nine Provinces united; now there will surely be a day when the Five Continents are united. The mantis stalks the cicada, and the cicada suffers, but the oriole is behind it. Alas, mantis, how can you be so proud!</p>
<p>"Lu Fangweng's Writing of Grief": In my early years, I did not know the hardships of the world; I gazed north at the Central Plains with the spirit of a mountain. Warships crossed the Guazhou ferry in the evening snow; iron horses crossed the Daguanshan Pass in the autumn wind. I boast in vain of being the Great Wall of the border, but the gray beard in the mirror has already turned white first! The Chu Shi Biao is truly world-famous; who can be compared to him for a thousand years?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were born in a turbulent time, with smoke and fire everywhere, and drums shaking the sky. The vast land of Yu has become a stage for the brutal invaders to ravage. The spirit of Wen Tianxiang is not acting, and the historical Tao Lin is dead. The heroic spirit of swallowing the Hu and Jie and weeping ghosts is nowhere to be found. Then where can we find the Chu Shi Biao? In the past, I saw a poetic riddle that said, "○ Girls do not know the hatred of national subjugation," followed by the five characters Shang, Zhao, Han, Wei, and Er. It is a poem by a Tang dynasty poet that "The singing girls do not know the hatred of national subjugation; across the river, they still sing the Backyard Flower." Many people know this. Because I thought that after Korea was subjugated by the brutal Rising Sun, there were more loyal and righteous people than in China, and many of the ordinary subjugated girls became prostitutes. They sang and danced with a clapper and red teeth, not knowing the fall of their motherland. There were many such people. Therefore, Korean girls do not know the hatred of national subjugation! Is it only the singing girls of our country? This poem was written by someone who traveled to Korea, and he was moved by what he saw and felt, so he changed one character and made it an exquisite verse. However, in the eyes of the brutal invaders, it will be changed to the character "zhi." Alas! The Japanese call our country "Zhi," which is based on the two characters "Zhina," but it actually curses us with the meaning of "disorganized and fragmented." Looking at how they call Russia "Lu," thinking that once the sun comes out, the dew will dissipate, their cruel and poisonous hearts can be seen.</p>
<h3>Liang Ren Gong's Lost Portrait</h3>
<p>— Sculpted by Zhang Chenbo</p>
<h3>Hometown</h3>
<p>— Hu Tiwei</p>
<p>It has been twenty-two years since the founding of the Republic, and the emotional society still seems to have lingering feelings for the old lunar calendar, which all Chinese people say is killable. This was a major holiday five years ago. At that time, businesses did not have to create clever reasons to hang up "Summer Vacation" signs. They could openly close their doors to drink and enjoy the leisure at amusement parks, admiring the tall structures. Red Leaf, who was six hundred miles away from his hometown, because the company had bestowed a dollar on him to buy wine, and because he had pooled funds with several colleagues, managed to get a table and enjoy a drunken meal. Wine is a matchmaker for romance. After the tea and wine, playing a game of chess was considered a relatively well-behaved activity for a young man. On this day, ten people made up two tables. What about the other two? They were smoking cigarettes and practicing their piety in the gambling hall! Losing five dollars, playing three rounds of cards. Suddenly, the company's errand boy brought a quick letter to Red Leaf. It was sent by his brother from C Village, saying that their father's condition was worsening every day, and telling him to return home if he could get away from his company. Red Leaf read a few sentences, and his heart began to pound. He checked the train schedule in the newspaper and could still catch the 5:00 PM night train. He immediately hired a car and rushed to the station.</p>
<p>The ruthless wheels were grinding the image of his father's illness in Red Leaf's mind. It seemed somewhat ominous. Two months ago, his father had been suffering from asthma and could not sleep peacefully at night. Chinese and Western doctors had tried for a month or two and concluded that there was no cure, and they all advised him to move to a different place for recuperation. So Red Leaf sent his father back to C Village. As soon as they arrived home, his mother was taken aback and secretly told Red Leaf that his father had lost the vigor he used to have. Red Leaf saw this every day, so he didn't notice it. Later, he also discovered that his father's instep would swell high in the evenings. There were two common sayings in C Village: "Men fear wearing boots, women fear wearing hats." His mother eventually cried anxiously, thinking that this disease was coming on strongly. Red Leaf planned to stay home to care for his father and not go out for the time being. But his father refused, saying that those who eat other people's food should put public interests first, and I'm not going to die immediately. This kind of illness can drag on for a year or two, so you can go out tomorrow with peace of mind. Red Leaf didn't dare to disobey, so he asked his brother to write letters every day to report on his father's condition. The next day, Red Leaf got up at six o'clock, ate a few mouthfuls of food, and went to his father's room to say goodbye. He only saw that the bed was empty. His mother said that his father had woken up to use the restroom last night, and as soon as it was dawn, he had gone to the back garden to breathe fresh air. When Red Leaf heard this, it was like a thunderbolt striking his head. The doctor's hope that moving to a different place would be beneficial was again dim. He stepped into the back garden, and his father was sitting on a low bamboo chair under the osmanthus tree, wearing a blue satin jacket. His gaunt cheeks and head of white hair looked at Red Leaf from beside his glasses, without moving at all. Seeing his father's desolate and haggard appearance, Red Leaf felt the most poignant grief in human nature. He stepped forward and lowered his hand.</p>
<p>"Dad, I'm leaving!"</p>
<p>His father didn't say a word, but nodded slightly. Red Leaf kowtowed, and he saw two plump feet in black leather slippers. His heart palpitated, and he couldn't hold back anymore. He got up, and tears were already rolling down his eyes. His father still didn't speak, but opened his eyes wide and watched Red Leaf wipe his eyes with a silk handkerchief. The corners of his eyes seemed to be somewhat damp, because Red Leaf had never seen his father cry from the day he was born until now.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Night Talks</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruochun</p>
<p>Youths from a Foreign Land</p>
<p>Midnight, January 10, 1933, was my first time setting foot in the "Black Eyes" midnight dance hall.</p>
<p>The poet W, accompanied by an armed comrade from the XX Committee, came to the Silver Leaf Building and invited me to join them for a night's tour of Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>"Where should we go?"</p>
<p>After a deliberation between the three of us, we finally decided to explore the Black Eyes.</p>
<p>We entered a dark alley, a Chinese old-style residence with red brick walls. Several wind- and rain-battered pine and cypress trees hung in front of the door. We gently pushed the door open, and a pale-faced woman listlessly raised her head and glanced at us.</p>
<p>We handed our overcoats to an old man in a royal uniform and leisurely walked through a corridor with oddly colored walls, where we were stopped by a fair-skinned Russian youth.</p>
<p>He embraced the armed comrade who was with us, saying something in broken English that was hard to understand, as if he was asking for a dance. A strong smell of "vodka" wafted over, making us want to vomit. There were three of us, and we all had the temperament of comrades, so naturally, we weren't afraid of anyone. We invited him to a small square table inside, and the four of us occupied a seat on each side.</p>
<p>Just as we ordered the waiter to prepare four cups of black coffee, the Russian youth asked to shake our hands. He had realized our goodwill in inviting him, and he showed a very apprehensive and grateful expression, talking at length to express his apologies.</p>
<p>This unknown Russian youth could speak English, French, and a few common Chinese phrases. According to him, he considered China as his second homeland. He had previously served as a low-ranking officer under Zhang Zongchang. When he saw the uniform our comrade was wearing, he couldn't help but recall old memories. That's why he couldn't help but embrace him. He solemnly stated that although he was drunk, he had no malicious intent. He expressed his respect for all young Chinese soldiers. Although his actions just now were a bit reckless, they were also a sign of affection.</p>
<p>At this point, he looked at our comrade in uniform and said, "You have such a beautiful face! With the lines of a Greek. For someone as young as you to be willing to go to the Northeast to kill the enemy, there is infinite hope for China's future!"</p>
<p>After drinking a few sips of coffee, he became even more excited. We had no interest in watching the dance moves of the women in cabaret costumes, nor did we pay attention to the black music. We all listened quietly to the tipsy foreign youth's impassioned monologue...</p>
<p>"Ah! Governor Zhang was a great talent among Chinese military men. It's true, he was a warlord, he didn't understand politics, he didn't believe in doctrines, but he was a man, with the spirit of a husband. When I was an officer under him, he treated us very well, like his own brothers. Even if we were owed pay for two or three months, we were willing to be under his command and would not have any resentment. Because as soon as the Marshal had money, he would always distribute hundreds or tens of dollars to us. He was truly a straightforward and good man!"</p>
<p>"Last year, I saw a photo of Governor Zhang published in a Chinese newspaper. A friend told me that he had been assassinated. I burst into tears on the spot, really, I'm telling you, I cried at that time. If I wasn't tied down, I could leave Shanghai, I would definitely go and avenge the Governor!"</p>
<p>As he said this, his eyes flashed with a fiery red light. We said a few words of comfort to him, and we casually discussed many things about the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident. We talked until midnight. The people in the Black Eyes dance hall gradually increased. We walked out of the dance hall together. The foreign youth reluctantly saw us off for a stretch of the road.</p>
<p>As we were about to part, the poet W asked him, "Why are you drinking so much alone?"</p>
<p>"I've been drunk for over a week. I took ten days of vacation from the foreign firm where I work because I lost my love. She's already dead."</p>
<p>He said this last sentence to us: "If you need me, you can come to the Black Eyes to find me. I have given my life to you."</p>

<h3>The Financial Market in the Depths of Winter</h3>
<p>｜The Market is Deserted and Trading is Scarce｜</p>
<p>A Landscape of Desolation</p>
<p>A Chorus of Collection Calls</p>
<h3>A Brief Summary</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was sluggish due to it being Saturday, with only half a day of trading in the morning session. The initial cause was a nearly insignificant drop in London's foreign exchange rate by 0.0625. US banks remained unchanged. The Shanghai Gold Exchange saw only minimal fluctuations in the forward silver price. American cotton rose by four to six pounds. Bank telegrams reporting changes remained static. The opening price was slightly higher and flat, at 798.5 taels. The foreign exchange market opened flat for both British and American currencies. The Ningbo guild initiated transactions, immediately pushing the price up to 799.2 taels. However, internal trading within banks showed a firming trend, with forward US dollar prices for January at 28.125 yuan. As the rate eased by 0.0625, the gold price also fell back to 796.7 taels. HSBC's posted rates for both British and American exchanges remained unchanged. The foreign exchange market remained flat, and the gold market also hovered around the 7-8 tael range. There was a brief surge to 98.3 taels, but ultimately, due to low trading volume, and with Hengxing selling off, it receded to within the 8 tael range. After 10:15 AM, there were very few transactions, with prices fluctuating by only a few cents. Collection calls echoed within the market. Later, as the Ningbo guild continued to seek transactions, Hengxing also came to sell off. These two entities provided slight support to the market. Afterwards, the forward foreign exchange market eased slightly, and prices retreated to 797.2 taels. At the closing bell, no large-scale transactions from major players were observed. Swap spreads were low, having fallen to a discount of one tael offered by short sellers. Trading volume was low, and spot dealers were all offering discounts, as spot deliveries from the North Road had repeatedly arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Long positions had been pushing prices higher in anticipation. With the end of the old year approaching, spot dealers had no choice but to bear the pain and rush to liquidate positions. However, short positions were not eager to buy. This is a record of the market conditions for the half-day.</p>
<h3>Rising and Then Falling Back, a Decrease of Two Cents</h3>
<p>The morning opening was at 798.5 taels, due to the Ningbo guild buying, an increase of 1.1 taels compared to the previous close. Wanxing successfully bought at around 99 taels. Fuyu also bought, reaching 9.2 taels. Although the foreign exchange market opened at the same price as the previous close, it did not show any tightening. Sanjing and Wahby were both selling January US dollars at 28.125 yuan. Although HSBC was buying, it generally felt easier than at the initial opening of 0.0625. Qingfa and Yong sold at above 8.5 taels, and Wupin also started selling. Wupin opened at 797.5 taels, and the highest it reached was only 8.5 taels. It fell to within 8 taels. Wanxing came again to buy, still at 8 taels. Hengyu then came to sell, but struggled to find a counterparty. Wanxing had also reached its limit and withdrew. Retail investors pressed prices down, and within a moment, it fell to 96.7 taels. Yuanmaoyong came to buy, at around 7.5 taels. There was a slight fluctuation, and when HSBC's posted rates were revealed, and there were no changes for either British or American exchange rates, it became peaceful. Yingfeng and Heng entered the market, adding up to 8.3 taels. Wahby was willing to sell February US dollars at 125. Hengxing then came to sell, and it fluctuated and fell to within 8 taels, to 7.7 taels. At this time, the market was quiet. Dadecheng entered the market slightly, reaching 98.1 taels again. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market was also flat, and trading was low. The gold market became deserted from this point on. After 10:15 AM, the closing scene was already visible. Both buying and selling disappeared. Occasional transactions were sporadic. It dragged on for an hour, and then the Ningbo guild was seen successfully buying small quantities multiple times. However, Hengxing happened to be repeatedly selling at the same time, at around 8 taels. They saw each other rising and falling repeatedly for a long time. The banks were extremely quiet at this time. The market was mainly supported by the small number of transactions of these two firms. Although Wupin was on the selling side, it was because major players in the market were watching, and retail investors had withdrawn. Moreover, the market Wupin was responding to was also similarly weak, and it became even more boring. Only price calls were seen on the market, and there were no transactions. Hengxing had attempted to sell twice at a limit price, but was unsuccessful. Finally, the foreign exchange market seemed to have sellers, with May at 375 doing some trading, showing a slight pullback, to 97.1 taels. By this time, it was already close to the closing bell. Because there was a rate disclosure among the firms, the price was ultimately pressed down heavily, and it closed at 797.2 taels (previous close was 7.4 taels). Wupin continued to see the price pressed down to 96.8 taels. It was found that the lingering remnant of the half-day had lasted for quite a while. The highest price was 795.2 taels, and the lowest was 796.7 taels, a difference of only 2.5 taels. As a result, it fell slightly by 2 cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3>Disclosure Suppressed by Two Cents</h3>
<p>The disclosure price, because HSBC's posted price for US dollars remained unchanged at 27.75 yuan, was 864.86 taels, approximately 67.6 taels lower than the closing price, suppressing it by two cents more than the previous close. The posted price for January and February was the same at 799 taels, for March 797 taels, and for supplementary water 798 taels.</p>
<h3>Sporadic Transactions to Embellish</h3>
<p>Trading volume on the market was extremely mediocre. In total, Dafuyu, Yuanmaoyong, Yingfengheng, and Dadecheng also entered the market, while Hengxing, Fushun, Qingfayong, Hengyu Tongfengheng and Yiwupin were all sellers. Aside from these, there were scattered transactions. The Ningbo guild and Wanxing bought 100 to 200 units each, and Shunli also bought more than 200 units. The Guangdong firms Yifeng and Shengda did not participate. Hengxing sold more than 100 units. As of the day before yesterday, the total trading volume for March was 18,053 units.</p>
<h3>Only Price Calls Heard</h3>
<p>The "roasted red" price was lower yesterday. Initially, the opening price was called at 11 taels higher, but there were only price calls and no transactions, as the swap spread was also small. Later, the price reached 11.25 taels higher, and then transactions were seen. Yingfengheng was on the buying side, and silver shops were on the selling side, with more than 100 taels traded. The price was seen again at around 11.5 taels higher, but there were only calls and no transactions.</p>
<h3>Swap Spreads Have Receded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the February to March swap spread saw a retreat. The initial opening spread was 1.3 taels (short sellers paying). Ruikang paid Tongfengheng 7 units, Huixiang also paid Tongfengheng 21 units, and Cuichangyong paid Yingfengheng 70 units. Later, it was 1.1 taels, done by short seller Changshengyong with Tongfengheng. Afterwards, it decreased again to a payout of 1 tael. Ruikang paid Qianchangxiang 56 units, and also paid Dadecheng a total of 98 units. As of the day before yesterday, there were only 70 units left for January, and there were still 3,521 units for February.</p>
<h3>Notice of Exchange Holiday</h3>
<p>The Gold Exchange revealed yesterday that the exchange will be closed from the 26th to the 29th of this month. Trading will resume as usual from the 30th. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3>A Few Words in Retrospect</h3>
<p>Upon inspection, the situation in the market this week was complex. It coincided with swaps. March initially opened at 798.5 taels, and February at 99.7 taels, so the swap spread was 1.2 taels offered by short sellers. It then closed at 93.6 taels, the lowest price of the whole week. The next day, it steeply saw a peak of 804 taels, and then fluctuated around 800 taels. Finally, it seemed exhausted. These six days had a range of 10.4 taels. Overall, it fell slightly by approximately 2 taels compared to last Saturday. (roughly adding in the swap of 2 taels for calculation). There have been no major storms in recent years.</p>
<h3>A Mediocre Situation in the Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was just as quiet as the gold market yesterday. Initially, the asking price for British exchange was recently one shilling eight pence ten point zero six two five, because London's foreign exchange rate recently closed nearly negligibly smaller at zero six two five. However, British and American exchange rates increased by one cent, and American and British exchange rates increased by eight four three seven five, so the price was flat with the previous close. The recent asking price for American exchange was 28.0625 yuan, because American banks and bank telegrams remained unchanged. The forward silver price at the Shanghai Gold Exchange saw alternating increases and decreases, but all were small numbers. Although American cotton saw a slight increase, it was disregarded. Therefore, the opening price was also flat compared to the previous close. After opening, there was a period of easing, but it soon became flat. HSBC was unchanged, and the banks were still in good shape. The easiest time saw January doing 28.125 yuan, which was harder than the initial opening of 0.0625. There were very few transactions, suffering from the same disease as the gold market. The gold industry was extremely quiet. Only Taikangrun slightly lifted shilling. HSBC entered American dollars, and Wahby first sold and then entered, but selling was more than lifting. The Dongyang dealer slightly threw out and slightly ate shilling. Other than this, small decreases were seen. Because the half-day trading did not seem exciting. The price eased and then flattened, with only a 0.0625 difference. The result was flat with the morning opening price, and neither glory nor humiliation was seen compared to the previous close. Here below are recorded the entry and exit prices of banks in the half-day.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The initial offering price was one shilling eight pence zero six two five. Wahby sold January one shilling eight pence one two five to Zhengjin, and Zhengjin in turn sold April one eight seven five to Sassoon.

Extending to the closing bell, the price for January was one shilling eight pence zero six two five. The February price was the same, the March price was one shilling eight pence one two five, and the April price was the same. The buy-in prices were two five and one eight seven five.</p>

HSBC in turn ate up January 125 sold by Wahby. Later, it slightly leveled out. Wahby sold February 125 to Zhongfu. Wahby suddenly ate up January 125. HSBC's posted rates were revealed, and the American exchange was unchanged, still calculating at 27.75 yuan. The market then went from easing to flattening. However, there were extremely few transactions. Only Anda was heard to sell May 28.375 to McCallum. At the closing bell, the asking price for January was 28.0625 yuan, and the buy-in price was 125. The asking price for February was 28.125 yuan, and the buy-in price was 1875. The asking price for March was 28.1875 yuan, and the buy-in price was 25.

In addition, the British and American exchange rate opened at three yuan, three jiao, five fen, eight li and seven hao five.</p>
<h3>The Weekend Calculation and Dismantling is Mellow</h3>
<p>The Wide Angle Falls and then Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday. Banks, as usual, did not do any transactions in the afternoon. News regarding bank collection and payment must be calmer than usual. However, the cent dismantling price in the market was still chaotic. From a general observation, the cent price seemed to have fallen more than in the morning market, but in reality, there was no kind of rising or falling to speak of in the fluctuation scene. Only, in the auxiliary coins, the wide angle suddenly greatly fell in the morning market. The noon market slightly returned, but the result was more than half a cent lower than the day before.</p>

<p>Jiangnan Small Foreign Coins rose suddenly by three li in the morning market, at 6 qian, 2 fen and 7 li.

<h3>The Bond Market on the Last Day of the Old Year</h3>
<p>Retail Investors Have a Collecting Price Rise of Half a Yuan to More Than a Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market was already the last day of the market before the New Year. Because futures deliveries for January must be handled next Monday, and the market will be temporarily suspended after deliveries, the market was quiet. Upon inspection, the spot situation of various bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was only 14,000 yuan in total. Among them, disarmament occupied 10,000 yuan, and the rest was still clear. Futures for January were suspended due to preparations for deliveries, so there was only one kind of market for the February term. It opened at more than 920,000 yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, with the price rising back, the market also flowed slightly and transactions were more than 2.3 million yuan. The total was 3.25 million, in which the Salt Tax of the Unification was about 600,000 yuan. The rest was only between 200,000 and 300,000. As for the trend in various bond prices, the front market was extremely flat due to the demand for supply, so the rise and fall was very small. In the later market, retail investors suddenly collected more vigorously, so prices rose back consistently. The result was more than half a yuan better than the day before. Only the present first nine customs bond rose by one yuan and nine jiao compared to the previous week. The entire sixth term futures also rose by up to one yuan and two jiao, it is said.</p>
<h3>The New York Stock Market is Strong and then Exhausted</h3>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market on Friday initially opened with a very strong rising wind. Hoover and Roosevelt were meeting, and short positions were panicking, and they were replenishing one after another. However, the rising momentum soon slowed down, and transactions became idle. When the results of the meeting were announced, Wall Street, although acknowledging it as constructive, felt that the market situation did not have an immediate need to rise, so the trend became more and more exhausted. Only the closing price of most stocks was slightly higher than the previous day. The total number of transactions for the entire day was 700,000 shares. Here are the Dow Jones Indexes listed on the left.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>

<p>Longs and Shorts</p>
<p>There is No Need to Work Hard Today</p>
<p>Let us Wait Until After the Holiday to Compete Again</p>
<p>The yarn market in the morning was showing a decline due to Changji selling off, but trading in the market was quite clear, and there were also many changes in foreign cotton. Furthermore, the period for final accounting has arrived, and all business aspects are returning to their results. Both the long and short sides must wait until next spring to determine the victor. The majority of psychology is watching from a high position, and therefore there are more long positions passing the new year. However, the Japanese army's invasion is still fierce. How will it be? It is necessary to expand and contract according to the situation and customer needs.</p>
<h3>Human Standard</h3>
<p>At the opening in the morning, because American cotton was tired and flat, short positions were adding to their positions, and the prices of all months fell by 3.4 cents. In the afternoon, general retail investors were hedging, because there will be a week-long holiday starting tomorrow. There is no certainty about the period of market suspension, so there were many who were equalizing transactions. The price of each month rose by 1, 2 and 3 cents. The total trading volume for the entire day was 15,850 bales. Upon inspection, Changji sold 3,250 bales, Shenji 1,900 bales, and Suilong 650 bales.

The American cotton situation did not escape fluctuations, but the majority of psychology is watching for a rise. For distant months, tighten and do not release. From the handling of flower yarn delivery procedures on Monday, the market will be reopened for business on January 30th, it is said.</p>

<h3>Spot Cotton</h3>
<p>No business whatsoever, no transactions. The source was calculated to be 100 bales of general flowers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton is Consistently Firm and Quiet</h3>

<h3>American Cotton Speculation Limited Pending Settlement of Relief Bill</h3>
<p>New York, January 20th Dispatch: Regarding the cotton market situation this week, the raw cotton market was mostly stable, due to demand from the industry and other sectors. Investment purchases when prices fell were also part of this demand. Spot trading was quiet, but the price basis remained solid. The extent of cotton acreage in the next season is not yet clear. It is said that if the rural relief bill becomes a reality without clauses restricting cotton acreage, then farmers will inevitably increase cotton planting. According to Washington news, the Senate may need to amend the rural relief bill to allocate funds to wheat, while a separate relief plan will be formulated for cotton farmers. This uncertainty limits speculation in the cotton market, and also depresses forward trade in cotton cloth and raw cotton. The House has passed the agricultural appropriation bill, stipulating that the debt amount shall not exceed 75 million yuan. This bill is now awaiting a vote in the Senate.</p>

<p>Heavy Stock and Sluggish Sales in Hexia Rice Market</p>
<p>Heke glutinous rice Stagnant... Foreign Rice Prices Rise</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, few boats arrived from Hexia. There are over a hundred rice shops in Hexia. High-quality rice is scarce, and mid-grade rice is predominant. Merchants selectively purchase higher-priced rice, causing the market price to drop by 10-20 cents. Only a small amount of thin rice arrived, and retail sales were active, but prices were weak. Early rice market is sluggish, and Yinyuan rice is also weakening. Dujian rice is scarce, and customer glutinous rice is slightly weak. Yangbu glutinous rice is short and close to the price of thin rice.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only about a dozen boats arrived. There is a large accumulation of rice in Pudong. With the Lunar New Year approaching, merchants are eager to sell. Fortunately, stores in urban and rural areas made some purchases, and warehouses continued to handle over a thousand piculs of rice. The market shows weakness. The prices of Suxi, Tongbang, and Qingjiao thin rice have stabilized, with only rice from Changbang and Nangang slightly decreasing. Yinyuan rice is oversupplied, and prices have fallen by varying amounts. Duyang glutinous rice remains expensive due to its scarcity, and Bianyuan rice has no market.</p>
<p>(Heke glutinous rice) Yesterday, the foreign Heke glutinous rice market was completely stagnant. Merchants from Fujian and Guangdong originally had a strong appetite for Heke glutinous rice, but due to the year-end closing, they have all stopped and are waiting for the official opening of the new year before inquiring again. There seemed to be some activity in this street the day before yesterday, but because the Hexia market fell yesterday, the local hoarders have all switched to handling Hexia japonica glutinous rice. Foreign rice prices have risen again overseas. First-grade Saigon rice needs 4.56 taels, and small grains are as high as 4.34 taels. Importers are also hesitant. All parties are mainly focusing on consolidation. The market will not be lively until after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Flour Suddenly Surges in the Last Three Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month were stable. Although foreign wheat prices were still slightly fluctuating by 2-4 cents, each mill was watching, mainly because of the year-end closing and no intention to release inventory. In addition, the current month's spot goods are still in short supply, and external sentiment is also rising. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the prices for January, February, and March suddenly rose sharply. The current month's trading has to be suspended, and delivery is required thereafter. There are still transactions among merchants, and mills are finding it difficult to replenish their stock. Bullish speculators are selling tightly. The situation for February and March is very good because Tianjin merchants continue to purchase. The prices for April and beyond are flat because merchants have not moved and mills have also slightly released inventory. As for spot foreign wheat, it is said that Canadian wheat was traded for shipment in January and February at a price of 3.56 taels. The price of Australian wheat has not been finalized. As a result, January rose by 1.5 cents compared to the previous day, February rose by 1.75 cents, March rose by 1.25 cents, April rose by 0.15 cents, May fell by 0.25 cents, and June fell by 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Canadian Wheat Production Estimate</h3>
<p>Ottawa, January 20th Dispatch: Today, the Internal Statistics and Agricultural Science Department announced this season's wheat production estimate and comparison (unit: 1,000 bushels)</p>
<p>Wheat Production Harvest: 428,514</p>
<p>Production in Previous Years:</p>
<p>1931: 304,144　 1928: 366,726</p>
<p>1930: 297,872　 1927: 379,665</p>
<p>1929: 299,520　 1926: 407,156</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Chicago wheat on Friday rose initially due to the strong New York stock market, and then fell due to the weak Winnipeg wheat market. A total of 2,000 bushels were traded on the 19th. The market prices on the 20th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May　47.500　Down 0.125</p>
<p>July　47.500　Down 0.250</p>
<p>September　48.375　Down 0.125</p>
<h3>The Changjiang Gang Procures Over a Thousand Loads of Year-End Goods Last Year</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions are extremely sluggish as the end of the lunar year approaches. However, merchants from the Changjiang Gang, such as Hankou, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and Luzhou, purchased a significant amount of goods yesterday. They purchased over 5,000 sheets of 7-foot English galvanized iron, 4,000 sheets of 6-foot galvanized iron, over a hundred loads of No. 24 to No. 28 plain galvanized iron, two hundred loads of new iron wire, and transactions were also made in small nails (new and from local factories), galvanized iron tiles, and cement. In total, these merchants purchased goods totaling over 1,300 loads. Although merchants and factories from various regions are closing for the year, this is still a significant amount of business.</p>
<p>According to news from foreign firms yesterday, the market for tinplate is rising steadily, and the current stock is very limited, with the date of stockout not far off. Therefore, informed individuals are searching for spot goods in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other places to bring to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Diversion (1)</h3>
<p>— Ti Zhi</p>
<p>My colleague Lao Zhou is a taciturn person, but sometimes I can get a very intriguing and thought-provoking sarcastic remark or two from him. I am also aloof from the world, but I get along very well with Lao Zhou.</p>
<p>One afternoon, the postman came. At this time, I was waiting for a letter from a friend in the reception room. As a result, I only got two New Year's cards in a pile of letters, and I was disappointed. But unintentionally, I found a registered letter for Lao Zhou, which was sent from XX Middle School in Haimen, Zhejiang. I felt very rare at the time, because I knew that this withdrawn Mr. Zhou rarely had anyone communicating with him. But after I walked out of the reception room with two New Year's cards, this accidentally discovered miracle was temporarily forgotten.</p>
<p>In the evening, I sat at my desk feeling bored. I casually picked up a copy of the Records of the Grand Historian and couldn't read a single word. I don't know why, but I thought of Lao Zhou again, and then I thought of the registered letter sent to him that I found during the day. I thought that the letter must have brought many miracles, so I dragged my shoes to his room, wanting to hear about the news in that rare letter.</p>
<p>From a distance, I saw him sitting there, seeming to be meditating on something. I stood outside his door and saw his eyelids tightly closed and his lips twitching slightly. I didn't want to interrupt his train of thought, so I secretly walked into the room, sat opposite him, and quietly stared at his attitude in a daze.</p>
<p>His tightly closed eyes slowly opened. He didn't seem surprised at all to see me sitting opposite him. He invited me to smoke as usual, so we sat face to face and smoked.</p>
<p>"Lao Zhou! The winter vacation is coming soon, are you still teaching next semester?" I couldn't bear this deathly silence, so I asked him very solemnly.</p>
<p>"I'm not teaching anymore." He said, shaking his head at the same time.</p>
<p>"Do you have another high position? Our teaching life is really not a human life!"</p>
<p>"Where can I talk about having any high position? You think... I have to teach twenty-one hours of classes every week here, and I also have to take care of paperwork and manage the library. Every day, including preparing for classes and organizing extracurricular activities, I have to work more than twelve hours. How can I do it?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Interpretation of War</h3>
<p>— Feng Ju</p>
<p>"War" is originally a very ominous term in human society. However, this term is used by oppressors and exploiters as evil, while it is used by the oppressed and exploited as an extremely sacred and solemn action to protect survival and revive the extinct.</p>
<p>Indeed, for the sake of the peace and happiness of the masses, we should oppose war, but this should only refer to "evil wars." If war is for the sake of resisting oppression and resisting exploitation, then it is a revolutionary war, which is the driving force for advancing the times. For history and for humanity, we should not only not oppose "revolutionary war," but also actively participate in it. Because we believe that only "revolutionary war" is the only driving force to eliminate "evil war," and only "revolutionary war" is the only weapon for the oppressed and exploited to fight for survival and freedom.</p>
<p>Our country has been under the oppression and exploitation of imperialists for more than a hundred years. They have universally caused rural bankruptcy, economic depression, mass unemployment, warlord civil wars, and an unprecedented medieval darkness in politics in our country. In particular, Japanese imperialism is now tightening its grip on the throat of our nation, wanting to kill us in one fell swoop. In this situation, can we still indulge in false dreams of peace? Can we still deceive ourselves with the guise of peace? We believe that in order to achieve "true peace" and to end "evil war," we can only launch a broad "anti-imperialist war" at present! If there are still people singing the high-sounding tune of maintaining peace and opposing war at this time, then they are traitors in our national battle line, lobbyists for robbers, and enemies of the oppressed masses!</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, every oppressed person should recognize the true meaning of "war," and every oppressed person should especially grasp the only weapon of "revolutionary war"!</p>
<h3>Morbidity (1)</h3>
<p>— Li Yun</p>
<p>Another side of the life of a petty citizen</p>
<p>"Even if we Chinese are inferior to others in everything, this cuisine item is not bad, right! In winter, I say, Chinese food is more suitable than Western food." After a moment of silence in the conversation, Lei looked at the steaming dishes laid out in front of him and began to speak to his friends Fang and Tong again. At the same time, he filled his glass with the remaining wine in the pot... then, he ordered loudly to the waiter who was serving a dish... "Heat the wine!" "Chinese food is really not bad! I also love to eat it." Fang went on to say... "The old scholars say... the Chinese are too worshipful of Europe and America, especially the youth, and everything is better in other people's homes. In fact, their words are too arbitrary. We love Chinese food, isn't it good to say that we are lovers of national essence?" He said, laughing.</p>
<p>"Shameless! According to what you say, you can simply portray yourself as a loyal and patriotic warrior!" Tong had an expression that was half solemn and half comical. Suddenly his voice became increasingly indignant... "Hey, have you guys been paying attention to national affairs lately? China should stand up on its own! China should fight bravely! ...... Okay, the wine is here, give it to me!" At this time, the waiter was serving the wine, and he took the wine pot and poured it into his glass.</p>
<p>The sound of a erhu came from another room. Then there was a low and vague female voice singing. Lei and Fang were obviously listening attentively. Tong gave a cold snort at them.</p>
<p>"Listen to his mosquito-like cries! Come, let's drink, cheers to this glass, to bless the future of China, to wish the brave warriors victory!" Tong said, raising his glass and drinking it down in one gulp.</p>
<p>"Alas, why don't you join the army!" Lei said coldly.</p>
<p>"Me! Lao Tong? It's not that I don't have hot blood! It's not that I don't have courage! But the environment is really bad, damn it, the environment is too bad to allow me to join the army. But I want to fight the environment! I want to join the army! Go, go! Go to the Northeast!" Tong said, slamming his fist on the table, then picking up his chopsticks, picking up a piece of food, putting it in his mouth, and chewing vigorously.</p>
<p>Lei looked at Tong's increasingly red face and muttered to himself... "Useless! He can't stand a few cups of wine, his face is already flushed, and he still brags and goes on a drunken rampage!"</p>
<p>"What?" Tong's eyes suddenly bulged out, and he asked angrily. At the same time, unconsciously, he rolled up his sleeves.</p>
<p>"Don't make trouble! Speaking of joining the army, I have some news to tell you." Fang's words interrupted, "Do you know? Lao Jiang is going north to join the army. Do you think this is possible?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Liberation of Soviet Women</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>If you are a woman living in the Soviet Union, you have the same rights as men! Whether you want to or not.</p>
<p>You have to work like men, support yourself, and dedicate yourself to the construction of a new society. There, the sexes are absolutely equal. If you work hard, you can participate in any kind of occupation and do any kind of work. Even if you do the heaviest and most uncomfortable labor of men, no one will laugh at you because you are a woman.</p>
<p>You can be a mason, carpenter, street cleaner, cadre of a collective farm, you can also be a raw material manager for a steel-smelting furnace, or a heavy machinery operator, or a butcher, or the minister of the most important electricity department of the government.</p>
<p>The Dnieper Dam, which has now been completed, was built jointly by many women's labor. They are also one of the major driving forces for "completing the Five-Year Plan in four years."</p>
<p>There are two female commanders in the Russian Red Army.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the students in all Russian medical schools are women.</p>
<p>There are many female workers who also handle legal affairs. As for female architects, they can be seen working alongside male architects in the planning of all new buildings.</p>
<p>There are female drivers in the engine room of locomotives. Female workers are often seen arranging tracks on railways.</p>
<p>The magnificent "Park of Culture and Rest" in Moscow is managed by a young and slender Russian woman.</p>
<p>Krupskaya, that is, Lenin's wife, is tirelessly working to eliminate illiteracy, and she wants to clear it up within a limited time. Thanks to her continuous efforts, the civil education of Russia was completed under this slogan: "By 1933, everyone in Russia must be able to write and read!"</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, every woman values ​​her personal worth. Being the wife of a Communist Party leader does not make her particularly glorious.</p>
<p>Newspaper reporters did not visit Mrs. Stalin in Russia as they did Mrs. Hoover Coolidge in the United States. (Mrs. Stalin studied chemical engineering and was preparing to go to an artificial silk factory.)</p>
<p>There are really no weak women in Soviet Russia. In the cement buildings near the cooperative farms, they are often entirely female workers. They build walls, they lay floors, open windows, and install lead pipes.</p>
<p>Many new cement roads were made by women. Female bricklayers can be seen on the fourth or fifth floor of new buildings.</p>
<p>This equality naturally extends to all aspects. Soviet men have learned to help them with housework and take their children to the park. Men also have to buy groceries.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Times and Love (Manuscript Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>However, if such derailed feelings deepen day by day, how will they be dealt with in the future? This is sin! This is Mo Zai's sin! I am a promising youth. I am the future owner of the Republic of China. I must be determined to be a model youth! I must maintain a pure personality!</p>
<p>But his chest was still pounding. His psychology at this moment was like a thief, having set his sights on an object and preparing to seize it.</p>
<p>"Put his arms around her and ask for a kiss..."</p>
<p>He knew it would be easier than picking up something. But he thought, why are my emotions so agitated that I dare not act immediately? He felt a chill run down his spine. He looked at the driver in front. The driver was enthusiastically turning the handle, and had no time to pay attention to the two of them sitting behind him. He looked again at whether anyone on both sides of the car was paying attention to him and her in the car.</p>
<p>"How stupid! Who would look at us? The people coming and going on the road all have their own vehicles. Even if they see us kissing in the car, who would be nosy enough to interfere? Besides, they don't know who we are. The car is also driving so fast that people outside must not be able to see clearly. Kiss her, kiss her!"</p>
<p>He seemed to have made up his mind. But the more he made up his mind, the more his body moved, and the less courage he had to express it. From her body, another subtle fragrance emanated.</p>
<p>The car stopped at the entrance of the park.</p>
<p>"We're here."</p>
<p>Hearing the driver say this, Haiquan woke up from his dream. As if he had lost an important item, he regretted not launching a counterattack against Mrs. Hezi in the car just now. He jumped out first, intending to go and help her out of the car. Mrs. Hezi grabbed his palm tightly.</p>
<p>He gave the driver two dimes for drinks.</p>
<p>"A little more."</p>
<p>The driver still asked him for it.</p>
<p>"I don't have it..."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hezi took out two dimes again and gave them to the driver.</p>

<h3>The People's Sentiment of "Having the Heart to Serve the Country but Lacking the Power to Save It"</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>A few days ago, a reporter in Beijing met a friend who had just come from Beiping. We hurriedly asked him to tell us about the anti-Japanese situation in the Pingjin authorities and the performance of the people's sentiment. This friend immediately looked at us with a mournful face and said the following:</p>
<p>"I knew on the road that when I met you, you would ask me these two questions, because these are also the two questions that I often think about and pay the most attention to. But the more attention I pay, the more disappointing it becomes! Speaking of the local official who is defending the territory, since Yuguan and Jiukou successively fell, sending troops and deploying generals, although there is an expression of determination to resist, they still focus on defense. It seems that there is no preparation for counterattacking the lost territory. If one place is attacked like this, they will resist in that place, and if they can't defend it, they will retreat. They will telegraph the whole country to announce the reason for the failure to defend, and swear that they are determined to resist the enemy, but the result is still inaction, without making preparations to counterattack the lost territory. It can't help but make us think that this is only the wonderful use of the two words "resistance" of retreat and defense. As for what the people have shown, apart from the rich moving, schools closing and students scattering, and the common people sitting in worry, worrying that they will have nothing to eat in the future, there is still a peaceful atmosphere, with very little anti-Japanese organization or other激昂displays. The students of Tsinghua University have two sentences in their presentation to the school authorities requesting early leave and exemption from the final exam: "Having the heart to serve the country but lacking the power to save it"! From these two sentences, we can observe and understand the location of the people's will in Pingjin and the reason for the lack of expression!"</p>
<p>After listening to this friend's words, what is a little bit alarming and most worthy of attention is not those two helpless, extremely demoralizing words "having the heart to serve the country but lacking the power to save it", which can represent the psychology of the majority of the people of the country! We are not surprised by the inability of the North China authorities to turn defense into offense and actively resist. We saw on the afternoon of the 20th (see this newspaper's Beiping special telegram) that Zhang Xueliang said in his speech to all sectors of society at Prince Shuncheng's mansion that "to fight foreign wars, the whole country must be mobilized to achieve results." Standing from the standpoint of the people, we deeply feel that after the Japanese army occupied Yuguan, on the one hand, the central government declared that it was preparing to resist with all its strength in North China, and on the other hand, it still maintained a friendly attitude in various places along the Yangtze River. This unprecedented farcical diplomatic policy in the international community is inherently incomprehensible, so that Mr. Zhang, who originally had no spirit of resistance, did not have the courage to fight a solitary battle, which is also a fact that our common people can understand. As for some people hoping that Zhang Xueliang would disregard everything and imitate the spirit of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai to resist the Japanese, that is another fundamentally wrong and wishful thinking of the Chinese people, failing to recognize Zhang Xueliang's extravagance. But we need to solemnly raise the issue of the performance of the people's sentiment for discussion.</p>
<p>We deeply feel that there are two reasons why the people's sentiment in Pingjin is so depressed this time: first, because in the past year, the North China authorities have not only failed to protect and promote the people's anti-Japanese movement, but have implemented various oppressive measures to avoid giving the Japanese an excuse to cause trouble, so that the majority of inherently cowardly people have sunk into a life of decadence and compromise, thus developing the so-called "having the heart to serve the country but lacking the power to save it" result; second, because the people's organizations are unsound, so although there is people's sentiment but no people's power, it is easier to become decadent and depressed when encountering oppression. Moreover, cowardice and compromise, and the lack of a spirit of resistance, are also a common disease that the Chinese people have developed under the autocratic system for thousands of years. Therefore, to save the current disaster, we should not only pay attention to stimulating the people, but also pay attention to cultivating the people's power. The way to cultivate the people's power is to give the people organized training. With sound people's organizations, there will be great people's power. We believe that everyone with blood and energy feels heartbroken and feels the suffering of "having the heart to serve the country but lacking the power to save it" in the current situation where foreign troubles are so urgent and the whole country is still so lifeless. Therefore, although the reporter does not dare to compliment the Tsinghua students for requesting early leave and stopping the final exam, he expresses considerable sympathy for these two sentences of "having the heart to serve the country but lacking the power to save it", and really can't bear to blame them. Because these are really two honest words, which are much better than the government authorities who superficially sing the high tune of resistance but are actually neither fighting nor making peace and never counterattacking.</p>
<p>However, China is the hometown of the majority of us, and we cannot put the responsibility for this country's demise on one or two people in the government just because we have the heart but lack the power. We should realize that the fundamental reason why the country has reached this point of endless internal strife and external troubles is because we, as citizens, have abandoned our responsibilities, and our people have no organization. Therefore, we have no power to resist strong enemies from outside and eliminate national traitors from within. This is the problem that we should wake up in time and strive to remedy.</p>
<p>Problem Discussion</p>
<h3>Three Different Characters</h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>Shop Assistants, Shop Owners and Customers</p>
<p>The Problem of Shop Assistants Being Slow with Customers</p>
<p>This journal has continuously discussed the problem of "shop assistants neglecting customers" a lot, but all of them have focused on the shop assistants' side and ignored the customers' side. Although I am not a shop assistant, I think both sides should be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>The reason why shop assistants neglect customers has been explained very clearly and thoroughly by You Pingxiang, Ding Jingyu, and others in previous issues. In a nutshell, it is because shop assistants have shallow knowledge, despise the poor and worship the rich, and are infected with bad habits. In fact, from their own point of view, they do have a lot of pain. For example, the shop owner's low treatment, long working hours, bad environment, and insecure life are all enough to make them lose interest, feel bored, and feel depressed in their work. Under this kind of state, it is indeed very difficult to increase their work efficiency.</p>
<p>Of course, shop assistants often neglect customers, but sometimes this is also self-inflicted by the customers. Often, some customers do not think or consider what kind of goods they want to buy before entering the store. After entering, they look around aimlessly, or even pick and choose repeatedly without any opinion. Or, after the goods are selected, they are wrapped up and paid for, but they insist on lowering the price and reducing the money, so that the transaction fails and they speak rudely. Therefore, it is also a common thing to cause the shop assistant's psychology of being slow to customers due to various reasons.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, my conclusion is that to change the attitude of shop assistants being slow to customers, the shop owner must ensure that the goods are genuine, the price is fair, improve the treatment of shop assistants, make them feel at ease to serve, and give them a reasonable amount of time to read books and newspapers so as to improve their knowledge and enhance their morals. Customers must maintain a sincere attitude, be humble and restrained, and do not simply regard themselves as customers and despise everything. Shop assistants should also be calm and peaceful, not perfunctory or noisy, adhere to the spirit of serving the society, and do not add their personal joy and anger to customers. All of the above are also a kind of morality that should be in the commercial field!</p>
<p>Life in the Business and Industry Sector</p>
<h3>A Frightening Account of a Newspaper Vendor's Life</h3>
<p>— Yinghui</p>
<p>During the Shanghai Battle, I secretly sold newspapers around Yangshupu for five days. Business was really good. The old Shen Bao sold for one dime apiece, and the Shih Pao for 150 cash. I made enough for food, with a little left over. Although I was exhausted and frightened every day, I had to rely on luck and do my best to make a living.</p>
<p>These newspapers were secretly obtained from Wangping Street. Each time I went out to sell, I carried no more than five copies, as too many wouldn't fit under my clothes. If the Japanese soldiers saw them, I'd be finished. Japanese soldiers with rifles were often seen at street corners, but after five days, I became used to the work, and the fear disappeared. Sometimes I even deliberately walked past Japanese soldiers, pretending nothing was amiss.</p>
<p>After selling five copies, I would return home to get another five, repeating this process until all were sold. Little Jinzi and I initially sold about thirty copies a day, later increasing to fifty. The more people who read, the more money we made, but the more dangerous it became. We often heard people saying things like:</p>
<p>"A newspaper vendor in Badaotou was beaten to death by Japanese soldiers."</p>
<p>"Four newspaper sellers were arrested and taken to the Japanese military barracks."</p>
<p>"The Japanese shoot anyone they see selling Chinese newspapers!"</p>
<p>At first, we were afraid, but after getting used to it, we paid no attention to such talk and continued to secretly deliver and sell newspapers from house to house.</p>
<p>"Hey," someone would quietly call out as I delivered newspapers into an alleyway. I knew there was business. Then the person would ask in a low voice, "Do you still have newspapers? What's happening on the front lines?"</p>
<p>I didn't have time to say much. While replying "Yes," I would say, "The Japanese soldiers suffered a great defeat," hand over a newspaper, collect the money, and leave. There were few patrolmen on the streets at this time, but when we did see them, they were always helpful, unlike their usual harsh treatment of vendors. I think this was perhaps because they had seen the brutal face of imperialism during the Shanghai Battle.</p>
<p>I never imagined that I could sell over two hundred newspapers in five days. If I hadn't been so afraid of death, business would have been even better, but I feared not knowing how, where, or when I would die. This was a real problem.</p>
<p>I felt indignant. Why should Chinese people be bullied by foreigners? Chinese territory was taken over by foreigners and called concessions. The Japanese came to China to beat Chinese people.</p>
<p>(Important text continues on page 2)</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>What kind of situation was this? Besides, the Yangshupu area wasn't even Japanese territory. Why did they send troops to stand guard and suppress the Chinese people? If it weren't for this, selling newspapers would be much easier.</p>
<p>"Down with imperialism! We must overthrow imperialism!" I was filled with such resentment and determination by the stimulation and suffering from various sources. So, when I read in the newspaper that some people had joined the volunteer army and were fighting the Japanese soldiers in Zhabei, I thought about becoming a warrior myself, killing the enemy, fighting for the liberation of weak nations, and waging a war against imperialism for the toiling masses. What a great thing that would be! Wasn't it much better than secretly selling newspapers in Yangshupu? But in the end, I didn't go. My reasoning was... Waging war against imperialism and fighting for the survival of weak nations wasn't just about fighting on the front lines. I could sell a few more newspapers in the rear, so that my compatriots could see the newspapers under severe surveillance, learn about the war situation, and be inspired to resist Japan... Wasn't this also an important task? I certainly needed to continue selling newspapers! Even if I were to be sacrificed for selling newspapers in the future, it would be worth it.</p>
<p>One day, just after noon, I hid five newspapers in my waistband, eating a pancake as I walked. Following my daily delivery route, I first went to Ruyi Lane, then to Hongyuan Lane. As I walked out of the entrance of Hongyuan Lane, just as I was about to deliver the last copy to a tobacco and paper shop next to the alley entrance, I heard a rough shout behind me... "Stop!"</p>
<p>At first, I didn't pay attention, but then I heard the sound of a gun cocking. I turned around and realized what was happening. Three Japanese soldiers were standing on Huade Road behind me, aiming their guns and shouting at me. This time I really panicked. What should I do? If I was caught by these three dogs, things would not end well. I couldn't think anymore. The three Japanese soldiers were walking towards me. Ignoring everything, determined to survive this time, I bent down and dashed to the side of the road, where there happened to be a small vegetable market with some people coming and going. I dove into the crowd, ran into a tofu shop across the street, and escaped through the back door. Then I heard two shots. They were naturally shooting at me, but I finally escaped to another road.</p>
<p>I didn't know where I lost a newspaper. Perhaps the three Japanese soldiers picked it up, but what did that matter? Escaping with my life was better than anything. Afterwards, I turned corners and detoured a lot, finally returning to my three-story attic home.</p>
<p>My heart was pounding very hard, and I threw everything I had thought about before out of my mind. Now, the only thing dominating me was "fear." Really, I was afraid. I was afraid that the Japanese soldiers would chase me to this three-story attic, that I would be caught, that I would be shot! How dangerous my situation was! ... I saw the Shih Pao on the floor, and the big red characters on the newspaper turned into a pile of bright red blood, and the black characters on the newspaper jumped up. The broken things in the house also flashed with it! In the end, even the small attic seemed to spin...</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door opened. I opened my eyes wide and saw it was Little Jinzi. "Why aren't you selling? What are you doing hiding in the room?" he asked me. All of a sudden, my mind cleared up a bit, but what did I answer him? I couldn't say.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Are you dumb?"</p>
<p>This time I completely returned to normal, and all the changes were gone. I told him quietly about what I had encountered, and after I finished speaking, I asked him if he saw any Japanese soldiers walking in front of the door. I was still filled with fear.</p>
<p>"Was it at the corner of the vegetable market?" he asked me. "You were so scared by such a thing, your face looks like white paper! Let me tell you, I was on the south side of the vegetable market when the shooting happened, but I didn't run. I stood there and watched for a long time. Later, the Japanese soldiers found a Shih Pao, and started searching people. It turns out that was the Shih Pao you lost. I'll fine you a pancake." He smiled as he said this.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Plea to Society on Behalf of Vocational Youths</h3>
<p>— Aiying</p>
<p>The first lesson vocational youths learn in their service is that their knowledge is shallow and insufficient for application. Nine out of ten want to use their spare time to supplement their knowledge. The attitude of general employers towards this problem can be divided into three types: The first type believes that shop assistants can only be used and not enlightened. Once they are enlightened, it will be a disaster. Therefore, they strongly oppose their studies. Sometimes, if young shop assistants voluntarily attend vocational supplementary schools, it is considered a great act of disobedience once discovered, and they are immediately warned that they will be dismissed if they continue their studies. For the sake of food and clothing, young shop assistants have to submit. The second type believes that shop assistants' studies are their own business, and they are allowed to attend school as long as it does not interfere with their service. The third type believes that although shop assistants' studies are their own business, their service efficiency will naturally improve after their knowledge increases, which is not unrelated to the store, so they generously provide tuition fees. In Shanghai, the first type is still the majority, the second type only exists in modern stores, and not all of them, and the third type only exists in some cultural and financial institutions, which are truly rare. Therefore, there are countless vocational youths who want to study but cannot. The cry of knowledge famine pervades the city. Driven by conscience, I have to make a plea to society on their behalf.</p>
<p>First, I advise employers not to prevent young shop assistants from seeking education, burying their future and hindering the development of your store. Because we are now in an era of commercial warfare, shop assistants with shallow knowledge and low service efficiency will never win. It is best for everyone to send your young shop assistants to school like cultural and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Second, I advise those in society who are concerned about saving the country to use a large part of their energy and strength to promote and support vocational supplementary education, so that a group of young shop assistants who have already awakened can receive good and adequate education and become a vital force in your work of saving the country.</p>
<p>Third, I advise the society to unanimously urge the government to allocate a sum of money to promote vocational supplementary education, and at the same time, include primary vocational supplementary education in compulsory education, forcing employers to send their young shop assistants to school.</p>
<p>Fourth, I advise those who run education to run fewer empty universities and middle schools, and everyone should actively contact the vocational sector to run the most effective vocational supplementary education.</p>
<p>Ah, everyone, prick up your ears and listen to the tragic cries of knowledge famine from vocational youths, and reach out to rescue them!</p>

<h3>Land Surveyor</h3>
<p>— Liang Daohong</p>
<p>"Hey, long time no see. Where are you currently working?" Zhou asked me when he met me on ×× Road.</p>
<p>"Land surveyor in the Chinese and concession areas," I replied.</p>
<p>"Land surveyor? What's that?" Zhou asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"The term 'land surveyor' wasn't newly created by me. It's the only way for unemployed comrades to avoid debt. I've been unemployed for almost a year. My family's clothing, food, and housing have become a problem. Sitting at home, I'm very worried, so it's better to come out and survey land," I explained.</p>
<p>"Surveying land is not a long-term solution. Why don't you think of a way?"</p>
<p>"I don't have great physical strength. Although I have asked relatives and friends for help several times, they are evasive. The recruitment columns in the newspapers are unreliable. What other options are there?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Didn't you know? There is an old lady named Shen Bao, who is over sixty years old, who has opened a matchmaking agency. I heard it's very successful. Why don't you try it?"</p>
<p>"Is that so? I'll go try it right away. Goodbye! Goodbye!"</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Goodbye!"</p>

<p>Shop Employee Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Reality of Shop Owners Exploiting Shop Employees</h3>
<p>Editor: In this era of expensive prices and rising living standards, we ordinary shop employees, although we work more than fourteen hours a day, how much compensation can we get? How can we cope with the seven necessities of life? So, year after year, no matter how thrifty we are, no one can avoid some deficits. Fortunately, according to the rules of old-fashioned shops, at the end of the year, there are always some public records, bonuses, etc., which allows us to get through year after year.</p>
<p>Since the "January 28th" incident last year, the foreign goods shop where I work, of course, could not be an exception. The shop owner took the opportunity to declare the cancellation of the public records, bonuses, and other benefits of the shop employees. At first, the partners, considering the store's losses, did not express any resistance, out of the friendship of sharing the same boat. Now that the final settlement period is approaching, although all the accounts cannot be settled yet, a rough idea can already be seen. This year's business in our shop not only will not lose money, but there will also be some surplus. We ordinary shop employees then asked the shop owner to restore the original various benefits, but the shop owner completely ignored us. Isn't this clearly exploiting us?</p>
<p>Editor! How should this matter be dealt with? Please give us instructions as soon as possible. (The following is omitted.) Pan Shaoan</p>
<p>Editor's note: Public records are designated by the shop owner for the sake of caring for the shop employees. They are designated as a certain non-major income of the store that belongs to all partners. Regardless of the overall profit or loss of the store, this type of designated income must be distributed to all partners every year. Its nature is entirely a gift from the shop owner, so in stores that do not have public records according to the past, shop employees cannot make requests. The reason is because the law stipulates that "gift" is a kind of "laissez-faire behavior." However, in stores that have always had this rule, the shop owner cannot unilaterally announce the cancellation, because in fact, for this type of public record income, the salaries of the partners have already been reduced accordingly, and habit also has a huge force in civil law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the nature of bonuses is to extract a certain percentage from the operating surplus to distribute to the partners as a reward for a year of hard work. Usually, it is clearly stipulated in the agreement. Therefore, if the store loses money, then that's that, but if there is a surplus, this bonus is absolutely not allowed to be deprived.</p>
<p>Based on the above judgments, then Mr. Pan's colleagues should argue on the basis of reason and not give up. However, we know that this year's money supply in Shanghai is extremely tight, and some stores, although profitable on the books, are actually very tight. I hope that Mr. Pan and others will investigate further to see if this is the case. If so, then in addition to arguing on the basis of reason, they may as well make concessions by postponing the payment. Mr. Pan and others who can be considerate of "sharing the same boat" will also think so.</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3>Movies and Literary Tastes</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhenxia</p>
<p>The following are just some personal feelings obtained in the movie theater. Each paragraph is written as an essay, because it is not serious criticism, so it does not consider the limitations of time or other types of critical articles. It does not write about every movie. I only record the ones I thought were good or touched me. Everything is very free, but responsible.</p>
<h3>㈠ The Last Squadron</h3>
<p>A portrayal of an ancient battlefield, the crystallization of comradeship, the power of resistance reaching the breaking point.</p>
<p>The whole film is heavily Germanized, but this Germanization is not modern, but ancient, historical. All the cleanliness, order, and scientificization that modern Germans pay attention to are not seen in the film. However, its vigorous and resolute spirit, as well as the unique sorrow and discipline of the Nordic people, are constantly trying to be expressed. The era of the story is 1806, when Napoleon's army was sweeping through Prussia. In the history of the 19th century, we have read how the Prussian territory was hopelessly destroyed in the Battle of Jena, just like our Northeast before and after the September 18th Incident. This story vividly narrates the era that the Germans considered a great disgrace, and the crystallization of the whole film is the epic of a Prussian non-commissioned officer and his twelve soldiers who fought to the death after the disastrous defeat at Jena. It also includes some very temporary soft emotions caused by the village girl Dora, as well as the tragic experience of comrades loving each other from life to death.</p>
<p>In short, the significance of this film is to reveal the military's obedience and death. There is no great principle of the nation or the public. Everything is discipline, the power of discipline, discipline to the death! Therefore, the highest character in the film is a captain (squadron leader), but when they come into contact, the number of people in the company has long been reduced to the smallest unit of the battle, the squad (twelve people). In the end, only the French general is seen taking off his hat and solemnly paying his military salute to the bloody and blurred enemy corpses, while the sound waves mourning the dead slowly rise, and the curtain falls.</p>

<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of "Don't Waste Tonight"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Qing</p>
<p>"Don't Waste Tonight" premiered at the Cathay Theatre.</p>
<p>The content and plot of this film are roughly about a singer pursuing the man she admires, initially being rejected, and later succeeding. Therefore, the characteristics of the whole play are characterized by fierce expressions and lively plots, which can be called a romantic comedy.</p>
<p>The protagonist is Swanson, who is known for her flirtatiousness. Her performance can be said to have reached perfection, but her movements are a bit excessive. There are several places in the plot that are not very good, and seem to be inconsistent with common sense. The director's skills are very good, and the light and angle of the photography are particularly exquisite, making people feel very beautified. The several supporting actors are also very good, so they can complement each other.</p>
<p>In short, this film is well worth seeing.</p>
<h3>Review of "Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing"</h3>
<p>— Jingwu</p>
<p>"Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing," known as the first shot of Wufa's bombardment, finally met us at the Nanjing Grand Theatre the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The story of "Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing" takes place in 1814, when Napoleon failed and was exiled to Elba Island. All the kings and politicians in Europe were happily celebrating in Vienna. At this time, Tsar Alexander of Russia met the local beauty Crystal. At the first so-called "Conference Dance", just as everyone was having fun, it was suddenly reported that Napoleon had landed in France. Everyone hurriedly dispersed, and a dream of joy turned into a bubble.</p>
<p>The story is very ordinary, but technically speaking, this film is indeed a successful work. Lilian Harvey played Crystal, and her performance was lively and lovely. How touching was the song she sang when she went to the Russian Emperor's new residence and in the carriage! She is truly worthy of being the European Empress of Shadows. Henry Garat played Tsar Alexander of Russia, and his performance was romantic and satisfying. Rirdankova's noble woman, and the scene of the fake emperor flirting with her, was really excellent. The other supporting actors were also able to perform their duties well. The lighting was very suitable, and the Bai language was also fluent. The jokes and interpolations were all satisfying, but at the Conference Dance, the scene where the Russian Emperor and Crystal danced was too long and complicated. The rest was very good.</p>
<p>In short, this film can indeed be called a "masterpiece" on Wufa.</p>
<h3>"Dragon Soaring, Phoenix Dancing"</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>(Omitted above) The director of the film is very smart, and the clock selection is also flexible and moving. For example, the clock when the Austrian Prince Metternich read out the resolution after the end of the conference was expressed very deeply and beautifully. Others, such as Crystal, when she was picked up from a store and taken to the Russian Emperor's villa, this clock was dragged on for at least a thousand feet, but it did not have any stiff problems. This kind of novel clock is rarely seen in American films.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Lilian Harvey's Crystal and Conlevert's Metternich were the best, and the others were very capable, allowing us to praise them as good.</p>
<p>There is also one point, at the final ending. When it was reported outside that Napoleon had landed in France, the order in the lively and joyous meeting place was disrupted, and the kings and politicians scattered, and the Russian Emperor also hastily set off, abandoning Crystal. This style was originally a characteristic of German films. I think this kind of ending is also a clever place for the director.</p>
<h3>Tom Mix Leaves Universal</h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>The famous martial arts star Tom Mix has decided to completely leave the film industry. Originally, in the contract he signed with Universal Pictures, it was stated that he should act in six films for Universal, but now he has only acted in three, and he will not act in the other three. Universal Pictures is very understanding of the reasons for his departure.</p>
<p>Tom Mix recently announced that the environment and various circumstances forced him to retire and recuperate. He will take his wife and make up for the honeymoon trip that they have postponed to this day. After staying in Europe for a while, they also want to travel around the world.</p>
<p>Tom Mix has been in the film industry for twenty-four years and has acted in three hundred and seventy-four films. During the production, he has encountered twenty-five bone fractures and countless injuries. His famous horse "Tony" will also leave the screen at the same time.</p>
<p>How should we feel sorry and wish them good health for the retirement of this "Old Tom," the most famous and experienced person in the film industry, and his famous horse!</p>
<h3>The Little Girl Who Was Forgotten Is Back, Jack</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Six or seven years ago, on the stage of a Los Angeles theater, a sixteen-year-old dancer showed off her skills, attracting the attention of Chaplin. He signed a contract with this petite and unknown Irish girl and invited her to play a key role in the "Circus" comedy film. The next day, her name, Merna Kennedy, became famous in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Merna Kennedy had never been on camera before, and had never even been to a production studio. It was really news that she could play an important supporting role with the greatest artist on the screen.</p>
<p>The widely rumored Chaplin film began production, and Merna Kennedy's name spread like wildfire. Only half of the "Circus" comedy film had been made when Chaplin's wife, Lita Grey, filed for divorce. The film was temporarily put on hold, waiting for the trial of the divorce case that everyone in Hollywood was paying attention to. This divorce case had nothing to do with Merna Kennedy, but the newspapers insisted on dragging Merna into the vortex in order to get news. This sixteen-year-old girl, who was always regarded as a child by Chaplin, also became a good source of information for reporters.</p>
<p>The completion of the "Circus" comedy film actually became a great masterpiece for this inexperienced red-haired little dancer. Her achievements were unanimously praised by American critics. However, Hollywood was jealous of her. Her skills on the screen flashed like a meteor, and then she disappeared into obscurity.</p>
<p>Hollywood seemed determined to forget her, but Merna Kennedy could not be forgotten. When Lemir was making the stage play "Broadway" into a film, he abandoned a large string of established stars and chose her to play the heroine of the film. As a result, Hollywood was shocked again. At that time, she was twenty years old and secretly met enemies again. Therefore, she decided not to work unless she had the opportunity she desired. From then on, she was again unknown for two years.</p>
<p>Merna Kennedy deeply felt that it was not easy to rise again a second time, and it seemed that she did not have the courage to rise again a third time. But without revealing her feelings, she has now squeezed into the forefront of Hollywood stars. Her first film to rise again for the third time is Lady with a Past. She has been in Hollywood for six years and is now twenty-three years old, more beautiful than before.</p>
<h3>Movie Emperor Charles Farrell Has Resigned</h3>
<p>— Ren Feng</p>
<p>American movie emperor Charles Farrell has now officially terminated his contract with Fox Company.</p>
<p>He has been working at Fox Company for seven long years. His first famous masterpiece was "Seventh Heaven". Later, he and Janet Gaynor continued to produce many successful masterpieces, such as "Street Angel", "Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans", "State Fair", "The Man Who Came Back", and "The First Year", which can be said to be the crystallization of their hard work.</p>
<p>According to him, the director at Fox Company promoted him to play the main role in the film, so that he could develop all his talents or ambitions as much as possible. He is deeply grateful for this. However, Fox's time was used so economically that he did not have enough time to treat his "nasal disease". Although this is a minor illness, he feels that for the sake of general health, it is always appropriate to undergo surgery.</p>
<p>After Farrell quietly walked out of Fox Company and announced his departure, he walked into the clinic of a surgeon and asked to treat his "nasal disease". This was his first treatment.</p>
<p>After he left, Janet Gaynor will inevitably have to sing a solo show. Who will be the successor to Farrell in the future? This is really a big problem for Fox Company. "Tess of the Storm Country" is his and Janet's last joint masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Marlene Dietrich's Return to Germany Scheduled</h3>
<p>Marlene Dietrich was originally a star from the German Ufa film company. She starred in many famous films for Paramount. Her husband, Rudolf Sieber, was originally an important staff member of the German Ufa film company. He arrived in New York from Berlin on the 15th of last month and immediately transferred to Hollywood. His trip was specifically to bring a script written for Marlene by the Ufa company to his wife. At the same time, he took this opportunity to spend Christmas with his beloved wife. Ms. Dietrich is scheduled to depart for Germany around April 1st. At that time, her contract with Paramount will have expired, and Josef von Sternberg will have been working as a director at Ufa. (Note: Sternberg was previously rumored to retire, but in reality, it was a pretext to decline the employer's request. When Ufa's representative, Illek Pummer, came to the United States, he signed a contract with Ufa.)</p>
<h3>"The Match King's" Story (16)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>"Paul, I'm terribly sorry," she said softly, unwilling to hurt him, "but I must tell you... I waited for a long time, and you never came... so I..."</p>
<p>He looked at her face as if he was blaming her somewhat.</p>
<p>"What? What's wrong with you? Baby, what are you saying?"</p>
<p>"Paul, I'm really very sorry," she said slowly, lowering her head... She said it, looking extremely pitiful. "But I have already... already promised myself to someone else."</p>
<p>His face suddenly turned ashen. His age seemed to have increased by several years in an instant.</p>
<p>"May I... who is that person, Martha?" he asked distractedly.</p>
<p>"It's Chilino," she said softly.</p>
<p>"But I was the one who introduced you two."</p>
<p>"Yes. I waited for you for a long time, and he also waited for me for a long time... Later, I thought, no matter how much you love me, you will never be able to get rid of your business... And Chilino, he gave up all his career, he cancelled the contracts for concerts everywhere, he disregarded his future, regardless of everything, he came to my side... Alas, Paul, I think what you can't do, Chilino can do... but... dear... he is still waiting for me now, I will go back tonight. Next month, my film will be completed, and we will get married, and then we will return to Salzburg together."</p>
<p>"I hope..." Paul said, admitting defeat, "you can be very happy forever."</p>
<p>"Paul, you are so lovely, I understand all the suffering in your heart," she said. "How can you know!" Paul's throat was almost hoarse, and his smile was extremely unnatural. "Then you go, dear."</p>
<p>She took his hand. "Goodbye, Paul. Good luck to you, God be with you forever," he said softly.</p>
<p>"Goodbye," he said in a very low voice.</p>
<p>When she left, Paul collapsed into a chair. He was already a disabled man. The machine he created himself was still a slave to his own machine.</p>
<p>But the function of that machine has not yet been fully exerted.</p>
<p>Those Italian fake treasury bonds, he had already sold them on Tan Street. The big banker who accepted the treasury bonds promised him to transfer the account of forty million to a bank in Paris. So Paul took a boat east and returned to Stockholm. (To be continued)</p>
