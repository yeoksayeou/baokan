<h3>時評　意大利與國際聨盟華</h3>
<p>德意志退出軍縮會議。與國際聨盟絶緣後。歐洲形勢。轉趨緊張。事實上雖不至立即發生戰爭。而不安之空氣。乃愈見濃厚。德國堅持其軍備平等之要求謂在列國環伺之下。德國萬不能束手待斃。故於凡爾賽和約不公平之處置。表示以全力反抗。并將以自身之力。從事於軍備之建設。同時法蘭西在此時期中。雖未嘗與德國有同樣强烈之表示。但其於（安全保障。）幾視爲一種鐵則。等於立國之第二精神。其所以如此鎭靜者。蓋欲看清此時之德意志。果將擴張海陸空軍至若何程度耳。然而此中有一要件焉。即在資本主義國家方面。意大利在地中海據要津。在中歐爲巨擘。在北非洲方面。尤爲法蘭西之勁敵。設使德意兩國果然聨合。則凡爾賽和約。根本動摇。法國且不免多敵矣。再則另一方面。有社會主義之蘇聨。亦操歐洲列强互相爭鬭之樞機。彼助德則德國非但在外交上有莫大便利。在經濟上且占若干優勢。軍事上亦減却東顧之憂。是以法國不惜抛棄歷來之排蘇政策。轉而與之訂立互不侵犯條約。此爲法國外交上之成功。倘德國於此時盛倡反蘇。未免自陷孤立矣。</p>
<p>意大利認清其地位之重要。而又自顧其本身經濟力之薄弱。欲與德意志眞誠聨合。恐有所不能。緣國家主義之在歐洲。已成互不相容之勢。民放衝突。一時殊變調和。而經濟利益。又彼此排斥。况法西斯國家在國家組織形態中已達極頂。斷難發生誠實之合作。而祇可暫時利用。意國審知此點。乃運用德法兩國間衝突之時機。不惜與主義上極度相反之蘇聨携手。以加增其在中法兩國間種突之時機。不惜與主義上極度相反之蘇聨携手。以加增其在中歐爭霸之優勢。同時使凡爾賽和約體系中諸衛星——法國影響下之小國。皆多少感受影響。則意大在亞得利亞海岸達爾馬提亞一帶。可自由支配。多腦河流域諸國。惟法國馬首是瞻者。亦將轉仰意大利之顔色。甚至德國亦不能不借重意大利以制法。此意國所以極力利用德國退盟之機緣。盡量擴大其聲勢也。</p>
<p>至於國際聨盟。其最初盟約。誠以和平使者自命。化干戈爲玉帛。端在國聨之運用。詎料九一八事變以後。一切國際盟約之神聖。皆被日本撕毁。國聨本身旣乏維護條約之實力。與會諸大國。又不能秉公裁斷。以是國聨信譽。乃一落千丈。近且凡爾賽條約對象之德意志。亦竟脱離國聨範圍。而國際聨盟。遂成爲無用之工具即議論是非折衝外交之作用。亦且盡失。</p>
<p>當此時也。意大利爲加强其國際上地位。進而奪歐洲覇權起見。於是提議改組國際聨盟。并擬擴大四强公約。邀請美蘇日諸國參加。此舉如果成功。則操縱於法德間之意大利。將一變而爲領導歐洲之大國。不過目前形勢。英法關係。尚不十分惡劣。其對德步調且能一致。法國决不肯讓意大利單獨領導。英亦不願任意大利之縱横。蘇聨之對意示好。僅爲一時權宜之計。安肯不設防備。北美合衆國更不肯輕於放棄其門羅主義。而於糾纏不清之際。加入意大利所倡導之新國聨。以自毁其傅統之立場。至於中歐諸小國。必然觀望形勢。靜待事實之變化。如是則意大利改組國聨之計劃。僅能表示意國之雄圖。而實際性則殊鮮少也。</p>
<h3>林業諮議會成立</h3>

<h3>對國聨改組建議　法國明白表示　會員國權利應同受尊重　國聨主要基礎不容動摇　希特勒正式向法要求　修改和約與軍備平等　交還薩爾謂永可消弭兩國戰爭</h3>
<p>（巴黎）外長彭古照例延見、外交問題新聞記者、有人以國聨會改組問題叩詢彭古意見、彭古答稱、十年以來法國所行政策、足以證明法國忠於國聨會、始終不渝、關於改組國聨會之事、截至目下爲止、尚無任何具體方案达達法國政府、設如有人以適應時勢之理由、提議改組國聨會、吾人凖備加以考慮、第國聨會以全體國家之權利悉被尊重爲基礎、無論如何改革、必以此項基礎不受摇動爲條件而後可、國聨會一物係法國外交政策之基礎、無論如何、决不令其直接或間接受何妨害、此爲一般人所其知者云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法外長彭古氏今日發表重要宣言、聲明法政府對於國聨改組問題之態度、彭古氏宣言最揭要之點、爲法國對於國聨之忠誠不渝、現法國政府至今尚未接到改組國聨之任何建議、將來一俟接到之時、自當與以相當之考慮、彭古氏稱國聨之組織法、在數處確已經過修改、即如第四·第六·第十二·第十三等章、均已非前此之原文、苟此後之更改實屬必需者、則法國自黨樂從、但國聨成立之根本原則、應保持到底云、彭古氏復稱、國聨對於國家平等之原則、已與以愉快施行、以法國而論、此原則自可攻擊之地步、故法國之所欲警告各友邦者、即日後之改革萬萬不可廢除理事會常任會員之原則、而代以完全之行謨克拉西制也、蓋今日猶如昔日、國聨組織本身之内、萬萬不可有强權操縱之存在、如現行條約均恃國聨之存在以爲依據、故國聨團體苟任其瓦解、則一切條約四强公約亦在其中、均須重加締訂矣、彭古氏末謂、（因此之故、可見國聨之内吾人不能允許任何極微小之變更、不論直接或間接也、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>▲法圖拉攏小協商國　彭古將作東歐之行</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法外長彭古不日將出游東歐東南歐各國、以固交誼、法國各報大爲驚異、但未加評論、僅謂近日之時事、使法國不得不與其可信之友討論新局勢云其所謂近日之時事、顯指意國對改組國聨之哀的美敦書、據中立國觀察家之意見、意國之哀的美敦書、已迫法國從事自衛、彭古近來益見活動、蓋半由於恐陷於孤立之地位也、小巴黎人報向與外長有密切關係、今著論警告政府、在英法聨盟之局可保成立及與論敦商妥如法德直接談判未有結果、則當取何種行動之前、不得輕與德國談判云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>▲太上國聨法難接受　美官塲不願遽下裁斷</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）衆信墨索里尼改組國聨之計畫、將使美洲事由美國處理之、遠東事由日俄處理之、而歐洲事則由德法英意處理之、美國官場對此太上國聨之計畫、向未予以最後之裁斷、但已有人認爲必遭拒絶、蓋料法國决不接受此種辦法、致使凡爾賽和約所裁法國貿易安全之保障爲之喪失也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>▲羅馬有變更意見向説</h3>
<p>（倫敦）於國聨會改造問題、據羅馬傳來消息、似汎繫黨大會之意向業已改變、該大會原欲由各大國統制一切、而取銷國聨會内部各國之平等地位、現在對於此層、已不似前此之堅執、其原因大約由於李維諾夫表示蘇俄不願參加意大　欲組織之統關機關、汎繫黨意向之變更、似爲英國之所樂聞、因各國平等原則、固英國所極欲保持者也、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>▲軍縮談話會外進行</h3>
<p>（倫敦）本日外相西門曾與軍縮會議主席漢德森會晤、但談話内容如何、則不得而知、惟有兩事、證明軍縮會議之局勢尚未確定、外部發言人所談者、不過濫時局面而已、爾事維何、即本日法國及意大利大使、尚與英政府接洽、此其一、美國駐德大使又向德總理希特勒要求會晤、此其二、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）軍縮會會長漢德森今日之訪晤西門外相、愈見歐洲各都城現進行軍縮談話之重要、駐法英大使竇納爾刻在倫敦、今日亦與西門晤談、英政府現藉駐使之力與德總理希特勒及意相墨索里尼分頭接洽、衆信倫敦當局與竇納爾及漢德森之談話、必與軍縮停會後外交方面交換意見之進行甚有關係、而與德總理希特勒新近與駐德法大使之談話尤有關聨、國聨秘書長愛文諾將於星期日抵英、小作盤醒、届時將與西門晤商、並對下院議員演講、愛文諾今夜由日内瓦赴倫敦、將取道巴黎與法外長彭古作一度之討論、星期一日英外相西門將在下院開茶話會招待之、查目前倫敦及他國都城之進行討論、乃根據軍縮主幹部上月所通過宜從外交方面互換意見、以期促進軍縮會工作之議案、漢德森今日語人、對於時局頗抱嚴重觀念、謂集合的和平制度刻在危險中、渠希望目前之互換意見、可使國際恊定爲可能云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>▲德向法要求改和約</h3>
<p>（柏林）德總理希特勒曾親自將德國之要求、交駐柏林法大使轉呈法政府今日法政府已收到該項文件、其條件之内容雖尚未公佈、但據官方證實其内容、與希特勒平時所聲明者大致相同、即要求修改凡爾賽和約及軍備平等、並稱、若法允將薩爾區域歸還德國、則德法兩國可永無戰事云云、法政府現擬在國會財政辯論完畢後、對德方要求正式答覆、但須俟駐法英大使由倫敦返來聆其報告、及星期四日法政府與捷克外長皮尼士交換意見後、始行送出、仍凖備由駐柏林法大使轉交希特勒云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>▲意外次赴柏林報聘</h3>
<p>羅馬外交次官蘇維區赴柏林報聘此事可視作軍縮會議延會時預定之國際談判之一幕、更可直接視爲德國退出國聨會後、意德間談判之一幕、意德兩國間此種談判、普魯士總理戈林之遊歷羅馬已開其端、蘇維區之赴柏林、係受德政府之邀請、此意乃德國駐意大使哈塞爾前日由柏林回羅馬時、面達墨索里尼者、吾人於蘇維區赴柏林之機會、可以説回意大利本國似已凖備允許德國按現在在原則上所有之兵力增加兩倍、惟自蘇俄外委李維諾夫與墨索里尼會晤之後、或者蘇維區以蘇俄見地不同爲詞、以節制德國之要求云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>孫氏首稱、張溥泉先生等、此次南下、專係敦促各地中委入京、出席四中全會、並交換意見、張氏此往、並未携有若何具體方案、四中全會决如期在京舉行、萬一港粤等地中委、因行程較遠、不及趕到、則擬於二十日舉行開幕禮後、稍緩一二日、再開正式會議</p>
<h3>閩事和平勢不可能</h3>
<p>孫氏續謂、陳銘樞輩、全係軍閥頭腦、彼以十九路軍當作私産、在閩創亂、十九路軍除少數高級軍官懷有野心圖謀不軌外、其餘中下級軍官士兵、均不願反抗中央、故待至相當時期、彼等終必相率來歸、但此時欲求和平解决、勢已不可能、若不予以重大打擊、决不能覺悟、余電粤請制閩、此爲日前之事、此次張溥泉先生等前往、成亦將商及閩事、至閩民請勿派機炸閩、中央非至萬不得已時、决不出此一着也、</p>
<h3>如有意見儘可提出</h3>
<p>此次四中全會在京舉行、凡屬中委自應出席、否則何得謂爲全會、港粤等地中委、如有意見儘可提出、從長討論、斷不能因有意見、而即不願入京出席、致使其意見無討論之機會、迨閉會後、及另行發表意見、則徒增糾紛、無補黨國、孫氏談至此、記者復叩以提前召開國民大會事、孫氏答稱、提前召開國民大會問題、中央原定本年七月召開、嗣以粤方反對、遂决定延至本年十一月、最後復遭其反對、故國民大會之提前與不提前責任、當由粤方負之、</p>
<h3>全會討論如何團結</h3>
<p>孫氏最後稱、所謂（第三政府）以及華北方面謡言、當斷不至成爲事實諸如此類之（離心運動）、中央當預防發生、蓋目前再不能團結中國尚有後望乎、至如何團結、即在此次全會討論、此即所謂以民主的方法來促成團結、鞏固統一、此次四中全會、余個人並無若何提案云云、</p>

<h3>駕駛員總會要求處置　華輪外籍船員　逾限不受檢定</h3>
<p>照章應予撤換交通部爲整頓航務起見、特頒布檢定章程、並舉行船員考試、凡在華商輪船任職之船主大二副及輪機長大二管輪等、不論中外國籍人、自本年六月一日起至十一月底止、儘在五個月内、須到交通部受檢定委員會之檢定、如逾期不往檢定者、不得在中國輪船服務、今第一次限期已過、外籍船員均未遵辦、應全部撤換、本埠商輪駕駛總會、已呈請交部要求收回航權、改用國人、亟將詳情分報如下、</p>
<h3>外籍船員應同檢定</h3>
<p>交部頒布船員檢定章程第十六條云、現充中國輪船及各級職員之外國人、無論巴否領有商船職員證書、自本章程施行之日、卽六月一日起、六個月内、均應依本章第一條、及船員證書暫行章程之規定、經檢定合格、領有證書者、方得服務、今扣止現在六個月期限已過、而外籍船員、無一遵章受檢者、</p>
<h3>百餘外員藐視部令</h3>
<p>現在華商輪船各公司聘用外籍船員、充任船主大二副及輪機長等職者、經駕駛總會詳細調查、在長江及南北洋各輪中、共有一百數十人、而尤以政記肇興海昌大通毓大等公司爲多、其餘各輪公司亦屬不少、在本年交部舉行船員考試時、此一百餘人外籍船員、竟無一人至京受檢定、藐視部令、於此可見、</p>
<h3>失效船員何仍服務</h3>
<p>至本月一日六個月限期已滿、此輩外籍船員、照章已不得在中國商船服職、蓋不受檢定考試、已失其船員資格也、且無新證書之給發、更不能再任此項職務、惟交通部、對於此輩外籍船員撤消服職之命令、尚未到滬、故現在外籍船員、仍在各商輪照常服務、定章論者謂將等於虚設、</p>
<h3>駕駛總會呈部請示</h3>
<p>上海中國商輪駕駛總會、連日據檢定合格之各會員、到會詢問此事、僉以此舉關係部令尊嚴、與挽回航權、至爲巨大、業由總會根據棆定章程、具呈交部、請將逾限不受檢定外籍船員、應否照定章撤換、改用本國檢定合格之駕駛員接充之處、統乞明白批示、以昭大信、該項呈、文已經遞出、按照部章、如有不受檢定之船員、在輪任職、海關得禁止結關也、</p>
<h3>黄河長垣潰口　明春始可合龍　河北災區代表昨向工振組請願</h3>
<p>周象賢等週内赴長垣工次視察河北省黄河災區代表田家鼐·王鳳鐸·南下入京請願、並來滬與各慈善團體接洽乞振、昨晨、黄河水災救濟會工振組主任周象賢氏、自京來滬、田王二人、特於上午十一時半、赴外灘六號該組辦公處請願、速堵長垣潰口由周主任及羅秘書接見、説明工作情形、須晨春始可合龍、周羅等並擬於週内前往視察工程、田王等明瞭工程實施狀况後、即興辭而出、茲探誌工振組施工情形如下、</p>
<h3>一三兩區月内可竣</h3>
<p>第一區、河南省境内與第三區河北省東明縣内各潰口、多係旱口、均已堵塞、蘭封小龐莊等處、亦均合龍、有幾處已在加高堤身、作塡石排柳等培堤工作、該兩區工程、本月内可完全告竣、此外第二區長垣縣境内、除馮樓之第三十口門外、亦可竣工、</p>
<h3>冰凍之前運齊材料</h3>
<p>至長垣縣馮樓西首之大潰口、因水大流急、工程最鉅、現正運輸材料、預計需用石料八千方、現已運到二千方、餘在鞏縣採辦、因無船隻可供運輸、現决由本組購備船隻二百艘、期於冰凍前運到馮樓、其餘磚料四十萬、已運到二十萬、十萬已起運在途、木樁三百已運到、木料二千支、正起運、均期在結冰前運達工次、</p>
<h3>掛柳沉排同時進行</h3>
<p>該處工程、現正從事分散潰口水勢、築二桃水壩、與開挖兩引河、均在進行中、同時並於潰口水道中、横架一經寸之網絲、兩端用舊法掛柳、以柳條下垂水中、使河水仍可通過而流勢漸殺、同時復準備用沉排法、以柴排載石下沉、因前法用料較省、但恐慌急收效較難、故不得不多備材料、</p>
<h3>潰口合龍期在明春</h3>
<p>據該組羅秘書昨語新聲社記者云、馮樓潰口堵塞工程、如今冬天氣和暖、黄河不凍、或凍期甚少、則明春二三月間、可以竣工、如冰凍時長、則須至四五月始可告竣、水汎必在七八月間、故明年决無妨礙、以前黄河潰决、往往至三四年始可合龍、最快亦必逾年、此次能於一年中完工、已屬萬幸矣、</p>
<h3>浦東電話　今日正式通話</h3>

<h3>滬粤機　昨晨照常南駛</h3>
<p>中國航空公司滬粤機、因上期在粤爲惡劣氣候所阻、遲誤一日、始於前午返滬、故前晨南下班、改於昨晨照開、據公司中人稱、該機於清晨六時十八分離滬、未載搭客云、</p>

<p>春秋兒童週刊</p>
<h3>發刊辭</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>宇宙間的一切，不外乎生息於三個時期以内：過去，現在，未來。人之常情，總是感傷着過去，不滿於現在，而希望着未來。那麽，該我們來抓住未來吧！　　兒童，是未來的代表者，所以我們對於未來的一切希望，也就整個兒屬於兒童們的身上。我們是漸漸地老了，不中用了，眼睛着這内憂外患相煎相追的祖國，除了摇頭太息外，誰也想不出一個挽救的方法來。所希望者，祗得希望我們的富有朝氣的兒童們，將來都能把救國救民的一副重擔，挑在他們的肩頭，仗着大刀閭斧，殺出一條生路來，使我們這可憐的祖國，終於有否極泰來的一天。　　可愛的兒童們啊，你們是我們絶望中的一絲希望，黑暗中的一線光明！我們目前雖是淪陷在地獄之中，却期待你們快快長大起來，拯救我們。你們是祖國的未來的主人翁，你們的責任是何等的重大？　　然而，你們現在還是在幼小的時代，如花含苞，如日方升，甚麽都需要我們的扶助與愛護。可是我們自愧力量太薄弱了，只能在每星期日刊行這一紙小小的兒童周報，買獻於我們親愛的小朋友，給你們每星期日在跑跳玩笑之餘，多一種有興味的讀物。小朋友們啊，我們掬着十二萬分的至誠，祝你們智德體三育同時並進，進步無量！</p>
<h3>中國的憂患</h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>有一這河流，外國人稱它是（中國的憂患）。　　那是黄河。</p>
<p>德國有一位工程師，在巴里伐亞造了一這模型的黄河，長約五十里，日夜在研究它的病源。那種精神是可佩服的。</p>
<p>昌明科學，是可以征服自然的。今日的黄河，在夏秋相交時，泛濫幾千里，淹没幾萬家，閙着可怕的水災，但假如用科學的方法，來　頓黄河水利，一面在上流刷沙，一面在下流疏濬，使河槽的深度加深，那麽黄河也不難變爲第二道長江呢。</p>
<p>要人家替我們想法子，是我們的恥辱，小朋友就從今天起，立志做第二個德國工程師吧。</p>
<h3>小李白和老太太</h3>
<p>— 黄鶯</p>
<p>李白，小時，最怕讀書。他説：（讀書，多難！祗有，傻子高興幹！天天逛，不好嗎？）</p>
<p>一天，這孩子，獨個兒，在街上逛。一種聲音，沙沙沙，鑽進他耳朶：</p>
<p>（什麽把戲？）他想，怪。</p>
<p>眼睛，掃過來，看，一個老太太，蹲在街角兒，把鐵棒，用力地，向石塊上磨。</p>
<p>（幹嗎？）他更怪了。向老太太：</p>
<p>老太太，抬起頭，帶笑：（孩子，我要把牠磨成一支針，縫衣服。）</p>
<p>（你，可不是儍子？鐵棒，這麽粗，好磨成針？）　　老太太，和善地：（孩子，錯啦，只要天天磨，用力磨，不怕牠不變成針！你可相信？）　　李白這孩子，不作聲：把老太太的話，想，想，想到了，（天下無難事，只怕有心人），只要用心幹，有甚麽事做不得？於是，他趕回家，發奮讀書，天天讀，用心讀；大了，便成爲大詩人。</p>
<h3>牛和羊怎樣吃草的？</h3>
<p>— 許宗傑</p>
<p>小朋友！我們吃喝了東西，嚥下去再吐出來可以麽？除非你患了胃病；或是身子不爽。否則總是由口而胃而腸，直到變了渣滓排滙出來才住。</p>
<p>牛羊是怎樣的呢？它們吃草，拚命地囫圇嚥下，一口，二口，……接連的不停。吃好了再嘔出來，慢慢地細嚼，這呌做反芻。它們爲甚麽（一番事情兩番做）呢？原來在人類没有畜養它們的時候，他們出來尋食，一面吃：一面防猛獸來侵襲，急急忙忙的吞下，回去嘔出來，再細辨滋味。這樣的弄慣了，遺傳到今，仍是没有改掉。</p>
<h3>自製實體鏡的方法</h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>眞正的實體鏡，價錢很貴，並不是我輩小朋友們所能夠買得起的；但是我現在有一個很簡便的自製方法，介紹給小朋友們。</p>
<p>先將硬板紙剪成一個硬紙權，（狀如眼鏡架子）然後拿包在香烟罐頭外面的玻璃紙取下來，塗上兩種透明性的顔料，（一張塗橙黄色，一張塗藍色）。分别貼在硬紙框上。説也奇怪，把這眼鏡，用來看隨便計麽圖畫，就覺得畫片上的亭臺樓閣，一件件地會得豎立起來，並且變成一種很美觀的顔色。於是我們的自製實體鏡也就此告成了。</p>
<h3>不是七個人嗎？</h3>
<p>— 學范</p>
<p>上課鈴玲玲地打了，一般在遊息室玩着的孩子，都跳躍地陸續跑進教室。</p>
<p>教師手中夾着二枝粉筆，和一册教科書：學生們見教師進來，都站起來，級長呼着：（一——二——三——）</p>
<p>今天教師講的很新頴，他不就講書，他呼着每個人的名字，詢問學生們家裏有些什麽人。</p>
<p>（趙吟聲！）教師呼着。</p>
<p>趙吟聲站了起來。</p>
<h3>獻給現代父母們</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>申報有這麽悠久的歷史，人家説起來，往往加上一個（老）字的街頭；其實我們那敢賣（老），却還時時刻刻向（新）的時代，迎頭趕上去！在去年六十週紀念年的過程中，已經有許多事實證明了，現在創刊（兒童週刊），也就是一個例證。　　我們新闢這兒童園地之後，每星期日和全國兒童們見面一次，希望萬千小朋友們，都來欣賞這園裏美麗的花果，吸收這園裏清新的空氣；更</p>
<p>航空，運動，讀書，爭勝，賭博，小朋友們，你喜歡那一種？</p>
<p>希望現代父母們，各自領導天眞的小弟妹們，給他們指示，作他們嚮導；這一種指導，比任何物質上的授與，更來得重要。再放大點説，透視我們的民族性，有日趨墮落的危險，要根本改造，非從兒童入手不可。現代的父母們！倘使館研究這重大的問題，各人教養自己的兒女，以補學校教育之不足，使未來的國民，都是新興的，堅强的民族，那我敢信明日的中國，一定可以復興起來。我們爲增進兒童的幸福，而編行這週刊，希望現代的父母和教育界，一致奮起，共同努力。</p>
<p>暫且不管國難如何嚴重，現狀如何混沌，先來實行改造兒童，做我們救國工作的出發點。</p>
<h3>三箇小教訓</h3>
<p>— 陶蕙華</p>
<p>（一）自己淘裏不要打架呀</p>
<p>姐姐和二哥在院子裏打架，媽媽看見了。</p>
<p>媽媽説：（自己淘裏不要打架呀！本事高，就打到外面去。小弟弟給對門阿三那個小日本鬼子欺侮了，你們却躱在屋子裏。自己淘裏打架，羞也不羞？）</p>
<p>二哥聽了，紅着臉不聲不響。姐姐伏在矮櫈子上哭了。</p>
<p>媽媽過去拍着姐姐説：（儍瓜纔哭啦！是好孩子就莫哭，記住了，以所再不要自己淘裏打架呀！）</p>
<p>（二）團結起來</p>
<p>二哥不知在那裏找來一細細竹竿，姐姐去把叔叔家的小方小珍和伯伯家的小雄小牛都邀了來，連我一共七個人。</p>
<p>我們各人去揀了一根竹竿，當做槍擱在肩頭上，排好隊，由二哥領頭，姐姐做先生，教我們上操。</p>
<p>姐姐説：（我們再不能自己淘裏打架了！小弟弟給阿三欺侮過，小雄小牛也給那高鼻子的阿英欺過。他們敢欺小弟弟和小雄們，就爲了小弟弟們力氣小，没有團結。没有團結，他們就敢來欺侮我們了。我們要抵禦外侮，先要自己團結起來呀！）</p>
<p>（三）我們勝利了</p>
<p>伯伯家的小牛肩着竹竿，給高鼻子阿英看見了追上來。</p>
<p>小牛連忙喊姐姐。姐姐趕出去，二哥小方和我們也一齊趕出來。</p>
<p>阿英看見我們都來了，他連忙站住。</p>
<p>小牛倒轉竹竿，指着阿英説：（逃的不算好漢，你來，我開槍！）</p>
<p>阿英眞的過來，姐姐和二哥趕去，他嚇的趕忙回轉身就逃。</p>
<p>我們笑起來，大家拍着手，高高興興唱着歌。　　我們勝利了！</p>
<p>（你家裏有機個人？）教師問。</p>
<p>（我們有七個人。）</p>
<p>（怎樣七個人呢？）教師又問。</p>
<p>（一個父親，一個母親，二個哥哥，一個妹妹，連我自己，不是……）趙吟聲一方伸出了小手，一個個手指伸屈着</p>
<p>教師笑了笑説：（照你説，你家中祗有六個人呀！）</p>
<p>趙吟一聲雙小眼睛望着教師的臉，小面孔紅潤潤的，他説：（不！先生！我們母親肚裏已有一個小弟弟，就要出來了，不是七個人嗎？）</p>
<h3>一個觀星象的人</h3>
<p>— 鐵楓</p>
<p>有一個聰明人，每天晚上，總要到夲曠的地方去，觀看星象的。有一次他不知不覺地走到城外去，他張大了眼睛，一心一意的向天上觀看星象，不料他没有顧到脚下，竟跌下溝裏去了。</p>
<p>這條溝是很深的，跌了下去，不容易爬起來的，所以他是很困苦，只好高聲呼救。有一個過路人，聽見了他呼救的聲音，就立停了，看是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>（哎喲，先生），他説道，（你在這裏研究天上是什麽的時候，爲甚麽不看看地上是甚麽呢？祇顧天不顧地，自然跌在溝裏吃苦了。</p>
<p>他説了纔把這個聰明人從溝裏救出來。</p>
<h3>敏兒遊歷記</h3>
<p>— 王行易</p>
<p>敏兒走進鳥國，看見三隻麻雀，同時找到一個小餅。黄麻雀説：（我先看見，應該我吃！）黑麻雀説：（我先看見，應該我吃！）花麻雀説：（我先看見：應該我吃！）大家爭論不休：敏兒豎起了大拇指警告他們説：（當心！後面有隻阿狸，正在爬上來！）三隻麻雀不肯聽，還是爭論，敏兒舉起小手警告他們説：（當心！阿狸馬上要撲上來了！）三隻麻雀那裏肯聽，仍舊爭論！敏兒拍着小手警告説：（當心！阿狸撲上來了！）　　（者！）一聲慘呌，阿狸咬住黑麻雀！踏住了小餅！　　敏兒瞪着小眼睛説：誰呌你們不聽我的話，忙着自己爭論呢？</p>
<h3>小笑話</h3>
<p>— 楊入</p>
<p>碰碰頭阿狸是不歡喜和朋友一塊兒玩耍，一塊兒做事，老是在家中和狸貓，洋狗，白鵝等作伴的。有一次，他的父親説：（阿狸，今天是星期日，你應該去才你的朋友碰碰頭，這樣老是不走出去是很不好的呀）阿狸聽了，便走到門外，恰巧遇見一個同學，便把自己的頭在那同學的頭上撞了一撞，回頭就跑了。那同學莫明其妙的問道：（你不是發瘋了嗎？）阿狸用了尖鋭的喉　一面跑一面呌道：（那是我父親呌我來碰碰頭呀！）</p>
<p>理髮匠父親問甲兒道（你將來要做怎樣的一個人？）甲兒道；（我將來一定要做理髮匠。）父親又奇怪又忿怒的説：（小孩子一點都没有志氣，竟説要做低賤的理髮匠！）甲兒忙説：（爸爸，理髮匠並不低賤，很高貴呢！你不看见大人物大總統見了他也要脱帽嗎？）</p>
<h3>拾柴的孩子們</h3>
<p>— 麥英</p>
<p>爸爸去拉車，媽媽去賣菜，姐在家守門，我同了三個朋友去拾柴梗我們四個人，大家搓搓手，提了一隻破籃子，向着郊外走。</p>
<p>樹上的枝兒葉兒儘向地下抛，我們都拾向籃裏去了。我們不必爭，我們不必搶，有柴大家拾，拾滿了籃兒就歸去。我們分散着拾柴，歸來的時候，我們的身子互相軋緊了。排成一字隊，走在路中間，大人們走過來，我們竟不讓，瞧着他們一個個的在路旁走。</p>
<p>我們的髮兒都給風吹亂了，我們的鼻子都給風吹紅了。我們笑，我們唱，我們快樂着。</p>
<h3>兒童智力小測騐</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>閲美國兒童教育雜誌，見有兒童智力測騐問題，試之弟妹，極感興趣。爰錄兩則，以餉讀者。小朋友們課餘，曷一試於同儕。</p>
<p>問題一：公園中的長椅上，坐着一個大人，一個孩子。大人向孩子説道：（孩子，你是我親生的兒子嗎？）孩子點點頭答道：（是啊，我是你親生的兒子啊！）大人又對孩子説道：（那麽你呌我一聲爸爸吧！）孩子摇摇頭表示不肯。大人又説道：（你旣然是我親生的兒子，爲什麽不肯呌我爸爸呢？）孩子應聲道：（我是無論如何不呌你爸爸的！）</p>
<p>請你在最短時間内，答出這孩子不肯呌大人爸爸的理由。</p>
<p>問題二：一根鐵質的電線柱，埋在泥士中是很深的，簡直無論用怎樣的大力，也摇撼不動。另有一條五尺長像手臂般粗的鐵練，鎖住着一頭牛。在同一直線上離牛五尺距離外放着一堆乾草。現在牛想去吃這堆乾草。而距離從電桿至乾草堆有一丈，牛離乾草堆有五尺；電桿，鐵鍊又很堅固，並且也不許將乾草移動，試問牛怎樣能很舒服自然地去吃這堆乾草？</p>
<p>請你在最短時間内，説出午怎樣可以吃草的方法。　　答案；（一）大人係孩子母親，所以孩子不肯呌爸爸，因爲問題中大人並不指明男人女人。（二）牛向前行雖步，便可以吃　乾草。　爲問題中　不曾説明鐵　　在電桿上，故鐵練雖糧，電桿堅固，都没有作用。</p>
<h3>寄全國的小朋友們（一）</h3>
<p>— 希實</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！</p>
<p>昨天我看見申報春秋副刊上一則廣告，内容是要全國的小學教師及研究初等教育的專家做文章，這文章就是給你們讀的，欣喜之下，就用我生疏的筆墨，求和可愛的小朋友作第一次的見面禮。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們是何等幸福，你們在學校裏有快樂的歌兒唱，有各種有趣的遊戲，更有不少的專家編了無數的配你們胃口的書讀，據我的舊經騐講來，我初時唸的是聖賢之書，完全不能看到一本專供兒童讀的書讀，現在我除欣慰的祝福你們以外，還希望你們多多地用功，我許你們讀書的習慣未曾養成，但是良心上的感悟，是可以推翻習慣的勢力的，完了，最後，我更希望以你們的眞心給你們的先生，相信，你們的先生更會愛護你們，祝你們快活！你們伴侶希實</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！</p>
<p>第一封信你們讀了有何感想，我懇切地希望你們也同我通信，把你們要説的話告訴我，我是你們的最熱情的最忠實的朋友。</p>
<p>小朋友，今天我來告訴你們一個故事，要你們牢牢地記住，當歐洲大戰的時候，法國有位老太太，伊有三個兒子，大的兩個在戰塲上陣亡了，伊仍然要第三個兒子走上戰塲，加入戰鬭，别的人都勸伊説：老太太，這是你最後的一個兒子了，你還要他去打仗嗎？）這位老太太却以堅定的語調回答道：（因爲兒子的陣亡，心目中當然極其悲傷，可是，我雖然愛我的兒子，然而却尤其是愛我的國家，我的兒子們不是屬於我的，乃是屬於國家的，他們一向是蒙受了國家的惠賜，在今國亡無日的時候，他們自然却應該以身報國了，）可愛的小朋友啊，我希望你們的母親不要菲薄自己</p>
<p>小朋友，怱怱地把此信收來了，祝你們快活！你們忠實的伴侶希實</p>
<p>▲清早起秋清早起，到園裏，花兒開，鳥兒啼；呼吸空氣强身體；身體强健立志氣，讀書做事都便宜。　　▲噹噹噹秋噹噹噹！上課堂，噹噹噹！下課堂每天功課莫嫌忙！寳貴光陰勿抛荒！少小不努力，老大徒悲傷！</p>

<h3>重入天堂</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>昨天，我在一本作文課卷中看到一個警句：（罪惡産生於盛怒的與憤激的報復情慾。）今晨看報，讀紐約巴黎關於宣告弛酒的電文，更覺得那警句抓住了眞理。美國人那麽厲行酒禁，各政黨還列在政綱，當作競選工具之一：我雖是滴酒不入唇的，總百思不得其解。有時在電影裏看他們私運和酗酒的情形，又覺得非常有趣；禁之愈甚，則求之愈急，謀之愈巧；消極的壓迫作用，幾乎没有不這樣閙喜劇的。酒禁旣開，紐約有無數人衆在各大飯店舉行熱烈慶祝；有一年達八十二歲之酒館主人，欣然重理舊業，並以法國出産之酒類配合一種飲料，名爲（重入天堂），以資紀念。巴黎的美國僑民亦在多數酒排間舉行濕節，以木偶代表酒禁，作惡婦像，高與人等，陳列之後，即焚燬之。（均見七日本報專電）這顯然是久受壓迫以後的報復情慾的具體表現。</p>
<p>茀洛乙德（Freud）的精神分析學，解釋心理的變態由於某種慾求不得滿足乃以或種形式表現出來。飲酒的一旦得酣飲醉飽，便覺得（重入天堂）；而干涉他們飲酒的，便目之爲（惡婦）。推而言之，當（生命）感受威脅時，其不顧生死，以一逞爲快，更是人情之常。</p>
<p>所以我雖滴酒不入唇，但對於美國酒鬼的心理却寄予無限的同情！</p>
<h3>禮貌譚</h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>這裏所談禮貌的範圍，是以（商人的禮貌）爲範圍。</p>
<p>我往往不敢進或是不願進那些我挨過白眼的店家。並非我喜人諂諛，却爲了他們那張難堪的（長臉）。他們做生意，好像你是個不客氣的被雇者；而他們是個不慣忍耐的顧客一樣。</p>
<p>商人對顧客的態度好壞非但中外不同，就本國言也是南北異殊。在北方，頗有不少的被雇者是很和氣的，他們送你出來，如是舊式建築的店家還會給你揭簾子，最少是在櫃台裏和氣地説聲（再見）。好的被雇者，即使你經過許多麻煩的選擇而結果仍一無所要，也還堆着笑，最多鼓鼓腮巴子不作聲，鮮有嘰咕的。而在南方情形壞得多，不過我不必再在這環境中的讀者前説起南方店家是如何的缺少好的態度的話，同時也無庸把這情形介紹給北方人，因爲這也是同樣的不必要</p>
<p>美國奇萊氏（F.C.Kelly）在他的（禮貌資本化説）（Capitalizing　Courtesy）中説：（禮貌也可算爲資本，很多營業是成功在禮貌上；很多失敗的營業是由於缺少好的禮貌）。是的確的話。</p>
<p>其實禮貌本身是樣不要化費本錢的東西，而同時也的確是最有用的東西。用（笑臉）説有禮貌的話，和用（長臉）説尖鋭刻毒的話，費的勁並没兩樣。如果那些商人知道（每日大笑三次有益身心）的話，那他爲了自家的康健也不妨放點好態度出來：最少，我想他們也懂得惱怒足以惹動肝陽的諺談，然而，實施這藥方子的商人實佔少數，他們寗願撫摸着脾胃趕走顧客，而不甘擺點好看的顔色出來！爲了自己和顧客。</p>
<p>據説有一次，一個富家的姑娘穿了樸素的服裝去一家大綢緞店、選擇得很苛，結果是空着雙手緋紅着臉給店員提起嗓子咒出來。不久後她着了華麗的新衣，乘了自備汽車，到帳台上先付了三百元，然後指定前回的那個店員給她剪布，她所要的布都在最高一層，她隨使的指點了一匹布要了六尺，接着又説：</p>
<p>（呵，東角上的那匹布眞好看，給我去拿下來！）　　五分鐘後，店員又被命把梯子移到西邊去……這樣地她剪了三十幾種不同的，甚至相同的布，她安適的坐在椅子上，向高處東東西西的隨便指點着要。雖在初冬時節，店員却給差得雙腿酸軟，熱氣騰騰了。</p>
<p>我想，在姑娘方面也只是（拿錢消災）洩洩氣，但這絶不是每個被辱的購買者都能如此，且都願如此的。也許在長櫃的看來他這店員的不客氣却爲也成（資本），然而，即使有這樣，（鞠躬盡瘁）的店員，誠心願幹這種由無禮貌誕生出來的好買賣，但爲了店的前途，怕終還找不到一個願採用這辦法來擴展營業的主人吧。</p>
<h3>村戲徐轉蓬</h3>
<p>到了九十月，稻子收割了，金黄的稻草一堆堆的疊在像傘形的大松樹下，蕎麥也已播種，離收穫的日子還遠、農夫們比較閒空了，在這些月份，各個小村小鎭常常輪流着睛了戲班演戲，但這是前幾年的事。這幾年戲班也少了，據説戲子都改了行，甚至新學做戲的人也没有了。一個戲班數十個角色，也常常糊不出伙食，偶然找到個出演的地方，就很難找到第二個去處。</p>
<p>今年李家村因爲廟宇開光爲着神的原故，循例請來了戲班。這消息好久以前便轟傳了周圍二三十里各個小村小鎭。日期一到，小販們帶着希望的夢幻從四處趕來，環繞着戲塲，張起布幕，搭了草棚，賭徒們也帶了賣茶的女人趕來，三二個一羣，檢定了放置賭桌的場面，先一些日子，就像把舵的舟子在看風雲：</p>
<p>（照這局面，不見得有多大油水，這年頭賭錢的人也少了……）　　他們這般憂愁的揣測着。</p>
<p>周圍各個村舍騷動着，婦人們都打扮起來，孩子們穿了新衣背在他們父親的背上去趕這熱閙。</p>
<p>李家村上每家人家，都來了客人，許多疏遠的或親密的親戚朋友。村上最窮苦的李大生家中，也來了這樣十多個客人，他們從戲班開演的第一天便到了，要看完最後一天才回去。</p>
<p>（就是有吃的，也没有睡的地方……）</p>
<p>他和妻商量，開始第一聲咀咒這次演戲的無謂。他們自己的床讓給客人睡，自己睡在榖倉上。米是借來的有限的幾十斤，但客人却一天天的增多，窮人和富人是同樣的有一批朋友來往的，甚至窮人更喜歡朋友。</p>
<p>夜戲開演了，台上的氣油燈亮着，追求光明的蝗蟲從田野上飛撲來，尋找娛樂的羣衆也和蝗蟲同樣的集合在戲台前面。鑼，鼓，簫響了起來，第一劇是桃園三結義，有酒鬼李白，黑臉張飛，紅臉的關雲長。連着第二劇便是尼僧會，搭花船等風流故事了，農夫們看見花旦上台，張大闊嘴嘩啦啦的大笑，坐在兩旁長凳上的女人，却没有聲音的啞笑着，他們算是娛樂了自己。</p>
<p>戲班是定演四天四夜的。到了第三天，小販們大半已收起布幕，預備走了。他們的希望的夢幻和雨點似的碎了。各種生意都冷清，賣義烏糖的小販也减了價，用破啞的喉聲呌賣：</p>
<p>（白糖一個銅板一塊，一個銅板二塊）戲班走了，客人走了。疲乏，寂寞，空虚罩着這村子。村上人得到了些什麽呢？許多人家欠下了多量的米賬。</p>
<p>想起爲了這次演戲的消費，他們的臉是和下雪日子的天空一般灰暗的。</p>
<h3>客窗小記</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>十三</p>
<p>在（墨華）裏，收了祝允明（枝山）的短札六通，第三封信是最足以看到作者的風致的。其文云：</p>
<p>昨觀飛卿家書，雖則宋牌，缺壞者多，其價反高。煩你過去，祇説别人要。講定十兩之内方可；若再多，不用他的。轉家就到我家一會。千萬，千萬！即日，允明拜。懷澶</p>
<p>這封信，很可以看到祝允明是怎樣的一個愛書狂者，而（語錄）式的文體，尤可見寫作的自然，與態度的眞實。不過，這樣的風姿究竟是明人的，我們没有學的必要；若要提倡這種體裁，要人去刻意模倣，其結果，不過是多些明代文章的置鼎而已。</p>
<p>十四</p>
<p>陳眉公的文集，除（雜著）外，到現在，我没有訪求得。在明（墨華）裏，收了他的信十通。誠如編者所言，眉公的尺牘，是極有風致的，譬如第九信</p>
<p>：</p>
<p>十五年不見，如思古人。昨見，則啓明尚在天也。黄米餅奉餉。徐天池先生，獨行之士，幸略其平生以示，此後死者之責，舊紙求漬老筆，以爲佳寳。晚生陳繼儒頓首。</p>
<p>其措辭殊幽默有致。第十信云：塞甚，甚念，老翁在小樓時也。二作孤健之極，自别古人後，久不見此詩矣。明日有晴色，當過伯承，約先生擁爐喫一杯冬至酒耳。少君先生高逸教下，繼儒頓首。舊紙奉還，俟興到，不必敲凍重煩老手。眉公在尺牘中，好作雋語，於此可見一斑。編者論云，（眉公筆墨佳處在此，其小處亦在此），可謂知言。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（五四）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>隨後他轉身向他的兒子：</p>
<p>（你看見嗎，嚇，你看見你母親病了嗎？至少你曾給她診視過嗎？）</p>
<p>筆爾回答道：</p>
<p>（没有，我並没有看見她有什麽毛病。）</p>
<p>於是羅蘭生氣了：</p>
<p>（你瞎了眼嗎，媽的！假如連你母親不舒服了你都看不出來，那你何必做什麽醫生呢？你看看也看，嚇，你看看她看。眞的，這簡直瞎了眼啦，你這粗心的醫生！）</p>
<p>羅蘭媽媽這時呼吸迫促，面色灰白，因此她的丈夫呌道：</p>
<p>（你看她快要暈過去了！）</p>
<p>（不會……不會……這不要緊……一會兒就會過去的……這不要緊）。羅蘭夫人斷續地説。</p>
<p>筆爾走了近去，凝視着她道：</p>
<p>（喂，你究竟有什麽不舒服？）</p>
<p>她用一種低微的聲音，急促地，反覆地説：</p>
<p>（没有什麽……没有什麽……眞的……没有什麽。）</p>
<p>羅蘭去拿醋去了；他回轉來，把醋瓶子遞給他兒子道：</p>
<p>（喂……你用醋使她　一　啦。最少你總把她的心撲過一下嗎？）</p>
<p>當筆爾彎下身去給她按脈時，她連忙把手一抽竟至碰到了旁邊的一把椅子。</p>
<p>（好啦，）他以一種冷然的聲音説，（讓我給你看　，你旣然病了。）</p>
<p>於是她把手臂伸他。她的皮膚灼熱，血脈跳得混亂而又急促。他咕嚕這：</p>
<p>（眞的，這毛病相當厲害。要吃點鎭定的藥才好。我給你開張方子罷。）</p>
<p>當他彎着腰在紙上寫字時，一片包含着急促的歎氣，窒息，短而抑制着的呼吸的低微的聲音，使得他突然轉過身來。</p>
<p>她在哭着，兩手捧住了臉。</p>
<p>羅蘭嚇痕了，問她道：</p>
<p>（路易茲，路易茲，你有什麽事情？你究意有什麽事情？）</p>
<p>她不回答，好像被一種深沉而又可憎的悲哀把自己碎裂了一樣。</p>
<p>他的丈夫想拿她的手，想把她的手從臉上除下來。熟拒絶着，再三説：</p>
<p>（不，不，不。）</p>
<p>他回轉身對他的兒子：</p>
<p>（她究竟有什麽毛病？我從没有看見她是這樣過。）</p>
<p>（這没有什麽要緊，）筆爾説，（這是一種小小的神經病的發作。）</p>
<p>看見她這樣苦痛着，他便覺得他心裏稍爲鬆了一點，這苦痛减輕了他的怨恨，减輕了他母規的恥辱的債務。他像一個對於自己的工作感着滿足的法官一樣凝視着她。</p>
<p>可是她突然立起身往門口跑去，她跑去得那樣快，旣没有人能够料到，也没有人能夠阻住她，於是她跑去關在自己的房裏了。</p>
<p>羅蘭和醫生面面相覷。</p>
<p>（這事你懂得一點緣故嗎？）一個説。</p>
<p>（懂得，）另一個回答，（這祇是因爲神經有點兒不適的緣故，在媽媽這年紀是常常有這毛病的。也許以後她還會時常有這樣的發作呢。）</p>

<p>世界語研究專号中　吳稚暉先生曰：凡世界上的開明人類，皆有傳播世界語的責任。</p>
<h3>葉餘漫笑口　世界語，世界語者，與世運</h3>
<p>— 黎晞</p>
<p>在（世界語研究專號（上））後裏，本刊編者提出了一個問題：（就是如何使已學會世界語的人，有充分練習的機會，以免生疏而至於完全遺忘。）這的確是一個實際而且很重要的問題。有許多世界語者都在熱心讀完了初步的課程以後，就是説在稍有了基礎以後，便自然而然地與世界語生疏起來了，乃至完全遺忘了。考其原因不外兩種，卽：生活不安定與接觸世界語的機會太少。</p>
<p>那末，在目前，我們怎樣才能使已學世界語的人不致因生疏而遺忘呢？我的意思，以爲：（一）必須多接觸；（二）定幾份定期刊物；（最好至少要定二份，國内的與國外的。）（三）經常和全國全世界的世界語者通信；（四）最低限度不要離開世界語運動；（五）多多的練習作文與翻譯。</p>
<p>無論學那一種外國語或學那一項技藝，多接觸是重要的一種鍛鍊方法。譬如軋朋友，天天晤對，辯駁，感情自然慢慢會增厚的。關於多接觸的方法，在國外，差不多各地都有世界語俱樂部，夜談會，星期座談會等等集會可以參加，但在中國，因爲種種的關係，恐怕除了上海内地就不會有。所以我們只有把一本書重複地讀着了。熟讀，對初學和已學的世界語者都是很有益處的。　　但是老是和幾本書接觸，無疑地一定要生厭的。所以定幾份刊物是必需的。好在現在世界語的雜誌各種性質的都有，可以隨自己所好的訂定幾份。雜誌的文字往往是最時行最通俗而且有趣的，所以决不會有枯燥乏味之感。説句老套話：從書本得到精，從雜誌求到博。</p>
<p>不過只是埋頭苦讀的接觸，還是不够的，甚至還要久而生厭的。我們必須要實用。實用的第一步是多講，不過講一定要有二人以上才行，所以我們要多多地通信，通信能够帮助我們增進作文的技巧，這是大家都知道的。大槪在學完了世界語文法（最多六個月可以學完）的人都能夠有通信的能力了。加以全世界的世界語者幾乎都是熱烈的頭腦清楚的人們，所以通信起來也倍覺親熱，而對於世界語更感到一種無上的賜與了。</p>
<p>到了這個時候，初學者已經到了一個相當的階段了。然而有許多世界語者也鄒是從這個階段上漸漸和世界語生疏起來的。他們或者因爲環境，或者因爲已有了相當的成就，都和世界語運動分手，而一個人孤獨地去走荒漠的前途了。到不了幾時就完全日益生疏，日益遺忘了。所以在世界語者有了相當程度以後，縱然不能自己置身於世界語運動，但最低限度也不要離開世界語運動！這是一個重要的關頭！因爲世界語運動使你時時增進新的智識，新的技能，使你不但實用世界語而且增進世界語的各方面！那裏再會生疏，再會遺忘呢？</p>
<p>不過，事實上，有的世界語者他們是有絶對的耐心，也許願意一個人孤獨地走荒漠的前途的。這一種人大槪都是文學者，他們的目的是在學了世界語帮助他們文學的工作，他們都能耐心地克苦地讀許多世界語的著作，和動懇地翻譯。他們對於世界語運動是冷淡的，但正因爲如此，這類世界語者他們雖然不會像一般人似地遺忘，但是他們大槪都長於寫，長於看，而却不長於聽和講的。這也是一個缺點。所以，現在我重複地説：無論如何凡是世界語者都不要離開世界語運動！每個世界語者都要推動世界語運動，然從在廣泛的運動下，我們才有充分的，自然的，容易遇到的學習機會！只有這樣，我們的言語才能被實際使用而擴充，而深！</p>
<p>世界語常識</p>
<h3>預備學世界語者須知</h3>
<p>— 周建綱</p>
<p>▲多少時候可以學會▲</p>
<p>我們知道世界語非常易學，但是究竟要多少時候可以學會呢？這是每個要想學成已開始學世界語的人常發生的疑問。宣傳世界語的人，常説三個月或六個月可以學會，而文豪托爾斯泰，却只有兩小時便學會了。世界語眞是這樣容易嗎？</p>
<p>是的，世界語是非常容易的。但所謂（學會）却有兩個階段：一個階段是（懂得），就是能理會教科書中的一切，第二個階段是（會得），就是能用世界語講，聽，寫，讀，得心應手，並無困難。普通説的（學會），是單指（懂得）而語的。我想，普通人只消三四月就能做完第一個（懂得）的階段，至多也只要六個月。如果學過外國語（英法德…語）的人，就更容易點。已做到（懂得）程度的人，雖尚不是全然（會得），但至少也能講或寫簡單的句子，及看淺近的讀物，如（世界語活葉文選）等等。至於第二階段（會得）的完成，是要看學的人的是否時時實用而定的。如果時時講話，通信，看書，則自然完成愈快。但是所謂學無止境，（學會）並無一定標凖的，所以要多少時間，也難决定。不過，用功一點的人，（懂得）以後，經了四五個月的努力，已有很好的成績了。</p>
<p>▲不懂外國語能否學▲</p>
<p>想學世界語的人常常問：我没有讀過英語，能學世界語嗎？有的人因爲没有學過英語，甚至不敢想學世界語了。自然，學過英語或法語的人，學起來多少要方便一點，但有時也有吃虧的地方。譬如英文中　Capital一字，有（首都）及（資本）等意義，對於世界語中kapitalo一字，學過英語的一看就理會，這是便宜的地方。但誤以爲Kapitalo也有（首都）的意思，這就大誤，因爲世界語中此字只作（資本）解的。這是吃虧的地方。所以未學英語的人不要怕，以爲學世界語是不可能的。</p>
<p>▲怎樣開始學▲</p>
<p>上期本刊有（教科書時期的世界語學習法）一文，可供讀者參考，這裏只談點更小，然而更具體的問題。學習的方法有三種，即（一）面授，（二）函授，（三）自修。</p>
<p>先談第（一）種。現在面授的世界語的學校不多，目下只有上海同孚路大中里十二號上海世界語者恊會開辦的講習班，分初級中級兩班，尚未學過的可入初級。從十二月十一起開課，今明兩日，尚可報名。期間爲三個月，學費共二元，時間在每星期一，三，五，晚上七時至九時。教師是個匈加利人，是十多年的老世界語者。</p>

<p>再説第（二）種函授。上海有兩個函授校學校：一是上海世界語者恊會辦的（中國世界語函授學社），社址亦在同孚路大中里。六個月畢業，隨時可以加入。學費共收五元。另外一個是上海世界語學會辦的函授學校，通信處爲上海郵箱二三三二號。六個月畢業，學費八元。願意入學的，都可先去索份簡章。　　關於第（三）種自修，可買（世界語全程）或（世界語捷徑）。前者是開明書店出版的，後者在上海世界語者恊會辦的（中國世界語書店）有代售，實價一元一角。該店亦在同孚路大中里十二號。（該店尚有其他各國世界語圖書，不下數百種）。</p>
<h3>國際世界語運動　日本的世界語運動</h3>
<p>— 蘇申祺</p>
<p>日本的世界語運動，是和蘇聨德國並稱的。尤其是近年來日本前進的世界語運動的抬頭，以及世界語文法方面的研究，更爲各國所不及。初期的世界語運動，是以歐洲爲中心的，然而世界語的發展，却要求着東方人集體的恊作，　　所以東方日本世運的進展，正保證了全世界世運光輝的未來，是有着非常重大的意義的。</p>
<p>世界語的輸入日本，是在一九○五至○六年之間，差不多和中國同時的。一九○六年六月創立（日本世界語協會），在幹部中有着當時急進的思想家大杉榮，堺利彦，和山川均等的名字。最近在莫斯科逝世的片山潛，據説也是在這個時期學習世界語的。大杉榮除在（世界語學校）教授外，並爲中國留日學生劉申叔張溥泉等開過班。這日本世運的萌芽期，只繼續了四五年。接着來的是黑暗期，擴充軍備，併吞朝鮮（一九一○年），軍國主義横行一時，恊會陷入於停頓的狀態之中，會刊（日本世界語者）也因經濟困難而不出了。直到世界大戰開始，日本資本主義獲得了空前的進展，一方面新文化運動，大衆藝術運動，勞動運動也漸次抬頭。因此世界語運動得到了新的力量而開始復生。一般憧憬着美麗的未來，懷着理想主義的青年和知識分子，紛紛共鳴於柴門霍夫的理想，而投身於這個運動，聲勢異常浩大。當時的新興文藝雜誌（蒔種人），創刊號上也刊着世界語的宣言。社會對立的激化，在世界語運動上也形成了左右兩翼的漸趨分離。在大正十三年（一九二四年）第十二次日本世界語大會上，舉行了一次ＳＡＴ分科（小組）會。一九二七年世界語者秋田雨雀，應了蘇聨的招待，出席十月革命十週紀念。秋田留俄期間，縱横驅使着世界語，到處演講播音。歸國後秋田就任國際文化研究所所長，會刊（國際文化）亦載有世界語的文字。一九三○年國際文化研究所改組爲普羅科學研究所，所内設有世界語研究會，其會刊（普羅科學）也闢有世界語專欄，並編行（普羅世界語講座）六卷及每年開辦世界語講習班。一九三一年，以普羅科學研究所世界語研究會爲中心，而創立（日本普羅世界語者同盟），成爲日本左翼文化運動的一翼。</p>
<p>以上是日本世界語運動的歷史的發展，現在且把日本現存的世界語各團體來分項叙述一下：</p>
<p>日本世界語學會（ＪＥＬ）（日本世界語恊會）停頓後以理想主義的少壯派小坂猖二等爲中心的團體，創立於一九一九年。是日本中立世界語運動正式的中央機關。會員約有二千人以上，基金有一萬五千元餘（日金），去年自築會所（辦事處及講習班教室）於東京本鄉區。除發行機關誌（東方評論）及月刊（世界語學習者）外並出版經售世界語圖書。該會通信處爲（日本，東京，本鄉區，元町）。</p>
<p>以中立標榜的日本世界語學會，近年已消失其創立時的理想主義的熱情。去年該會幹部小坂猖二等甚至列名（滿洲國請願書）（祝賀（滿洲國）的誕生，請求採用世界語），已將所謂中立主義者的本相暴露無遺了。　　世界語普及會（ＥＰＡ）以大本教（Ｏomoto，一種日本的宗教，喜以預言聳人聽聞）立塲來宣傳世界語的宗教性的團體。該會約有會員二千，機關誌爲（綠的世界）。（一二八）以後，該會曾出過（滿洲事變與上海衝突）一書，把日本帝國主義武力侵略中國的眞相，竭力掩護歪曲，並以此向國際間宣傳。普及會常派人赴各地（甚至朝鮮台灣滿洲）宣傳世界語，演講，開班，和組織團體。因爲後面有大本教的主持，所以並無經濟等等的困難，甚至還以（大本教本部）的名義出版一種國際性的月刊（國際大本）。但因其露骨的侵略主義傾向，所以爲各國正直的世界語者所不滿。但在日本國内的勢力，倒也不能輕視的。該會通信處爲（日本，京都府，龜岡町）。</p>
<p>日本普羅世界語者同盟（ＪＰＥＵ）日本左翼世界語團體，ＩＰＥ的日本支部，成立於一九三一年。它們的網領是：（一）從無産者的立場宣傳普及及實用世界語，（二）反對資産者的世界語運動，（三）恊力建設世界語的發展及其理論，（四）統一日本國内以及殖民地普羅世界語運動，（五）擴大强化國際普羅世界語運動。除出版機關誌（ＪＰＥＵ）及月刊，（同志）外，並經售各國左傾世界語書報。ＵＰＥＵ（當時尚隸屬於普羅科學研究所）出版的書籍有（普羅世界語講座）六卷，（第一教本）及（五一節）等等。二年以來，該同盟的勢力深入全國各地的工廠農村，而世界語通信（ＰＥＫ）的工作，在國際間也是很著名的</p>
<p>。　　日本世界語會（ＪＥＡ）是日世界語者梶弘和等組織的，又名（世界語研究社），純粹是個研究出版機關。會刊爲（世界語者）兩月刊，印刷精明，文章全部爲世界語。此外並出版由本有三的（嬰兒殺害一，菊他　的（父歸），拉狄克的（遠東的戰爭）等世界語譯本。通信處爲（日本東京，麴町區，三番町八三）。</p>
<p>以上四個團體是日本最主要的世界語團體，此外尚有（日本世界語學生聨盟）（日本鐵道世界語聨盟）（日本佛教世界語聨盟）（日本世界語文學研究會）等專門團體，以及出版（國際語研究）（兩月刊）的ＦＲＯＮＴＯ社等等，我只在這裏一提，不及詳述了。</p>
<h3>世界語專論　世界語與民族問題</h3>
<p>— 温憶慈女士</p>
<p>言語是隨着社會的經濟結構的發展而發展的。在自然經濟時代，言語的形態是方言，進入資本主義的時代，便形成了民族語。現在是人類社會進入於孫中山先生所説的（大同世界）的過渡時期，社會生活的各方面，都日趨國際化，而適應於這個過渡期，作爲國際的聨絡工具的語言，便是（世界語）。</p>
<p>我們雖然把Esperanto譯做（世界語），其實，現在形式的（世界語）並非就是未來大同世界中共通使用的語言。我們不是預言家，所以未來世界中的人類，其生活形態會變成怎樣的情形，我們現在無從知道底細。同樣，未來世界的文化以及語言形態，我們現在也無法知道清楚。然而根據現在我們已經知道的種種傾向，却也不難想像未來的大同世界中，因爲社會經濟的高度發展，一定不再有階級的劃分，各種不同的民族也會解消而溶合爲一個全人類的集體。同樣，在這個未來的世界中，各種不同的民族文化與民族語，也一定會解消而形成全人類唯一的文化與語言。</p>
<p>現在世界上各種民族，不是一律平等，自由發展的。弱小民族在帝國主義侵略支配之下，成爲它的殖民地半殖民地。一個國家内部往往又含有若干種的少數民族。這種弱小民族都民失去了政治經濟的獨立，和充分發展其文化語言的自由。他們都是文化水凖很低的，甚至没有文字，只有口頭的語言；在掠奪者的支配底下，他們做着犧牲品。這樣的世界正是孫中山先生所認爲是最不合理的。</p>
<p>總要等到不平等制度轉變之後，殖民地半殖民地纔能完全脱離帝國主義的政治經濟的覊絆；而一國的新社會關係建立以後，國内的少數民族纔能眞正取得自决權。這樣，全世界的各種民族，纔能站在一條線上，充分地自由發展其文化以及語言。</p>
<p>獲得了獨立後各民族的自由發展，使人類生活廣泛而急速地國際化，結果，人類間的民族的壁壘終　不得不崩潰了。同時，各民族的文化及語言，也將得到空前的發展，而迅速地國際化起來。與各民族語平行着發展的（世界語），將繼續不斷地攝取各民族語中一切國際化了的要素，而更行充實豐富起來，比現在的（世界語）更廣泛爲各民族所應用。無疑地，那時代的（世界語），終將形成全人類集團准一的語言，雖然在現在還只是一種胚胎。</p>
<p>所以（世界語）並不和民族語的發展矛盾的。不但如此，只有各民族（包含殖民地半殖民地民族以及少數民族　語　自由的發　，纔能使（世界語）在内容上形式上更行國際化起來．只有各民族的自由與平等，纔能實現大同的世界，同樣，只有各民族語的自由發展，才能形成大同世界唯一的語言。這個（爲了統一的分離），正是言語進化上的辯證法。</p>

<h3>蘇聨的世界語運動</h3>
<p>— 吳默庵女士</p>
<p>俄羅斯原是世界語的摇籃。柴門霍夫的（第一書）最先出的是俄語版。一八八九年，世界語者中百分之八十是居住在俄國的。他們對於柴門霍夫的人類愛的理想，異常同情，而熱烈地擁護世界語。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>一九二一年開第三次全蘇聨世界語者大會時，宣佈了（蘇聨世界語者聨盟）（ＳＥＵ）的成立。但那時政治的經濟的局面都還未十分穏定，所以民衆還未注意到世界語。直到一九二五年，情形纔轉佳起來。那年蘇聨當局宣佈了對勞動者國際教育的領導工作的必要，蘇聨世界語者於是在民衆面前提出他們的言語，做國際教育的利器，</p>
<p>這以後，隨着蘇維埃政權的日益鞏固，隨着各國勞動者的密切注意蘇聨的發展，國際文化教育工作日顯重要，因而世界語也日被蘇聨的黨政當局。工會以及一切民衆團體所重視所維護了。它們不僅在指導上，組織上帮助世界語運動，而且在物質上也盡量予以接濟。很多工會供給世界語團體以辦公處，給以津貼。例如：莫斯科工會聨合會供給蘇聨世界語者聨盟莫斯科委員會以會所，並每年資助八千盧布。有許多團體出薪俸請世界語者教書，或擔任國際通信的工作。</p>
<p>世界語在蘇聨是被看作國際通信的利器的，所以在工人，學生，機關人員，甚至兒童間的國際通信最爲流行。在通信中，他們經常報告五年計劃的成功，大衆生活的情形，並答覆國外世界語者的疑問。國外世界語者寄去的通信，他們就拿來在羣衆集會上朗讀，甚至拿到無線電台去廣播。蘇聨報紙刊載世界語通信者很多很多。其最著者要算克利米亞的MajakKommuni，白俄羅斯京城敏斯克的Rabselkor（勞動通訊），北部阿爾韓格爾斯克的（眞理報）等等，這些報紙的編輯部經常用世界語和各國的世界語者聨絡，要求做他們的通訊員。他如莫斯科，列寗格勒，各大工廠的報紙，紅軍，少年先鋒隊以及集體農塲的壁報等也經常刊登世界語通信。</p>
<p>用世界語廣播蘇聨的消息於全世界也是蘇聨世界語者工作之一。在敏斯克電台，每星期有三次世界語的廣播；莫斯科斯太林大電台（波長四百二十五米）每月逢八（八日，十八日，二十八日），於莫斯科時間夜九點至九點半用世界語播音，報告社會主義建設的消息；而頓罷斯斯太林地方的少共委員會則每月十五日及廿五日，於莫斯科時間晚七時至七時卅分，用世界語廣播蘇聨兒童生活與活動，兒童文學與兒童歌曲，波長三八五米。此外哈里可夫電台，亦有經常的世界語播音。</p>
<p>世界語在蘇聨民衆團體中最活躍的要算（戰鬥的無神論者聨盟），這反宗教的團體除以世界語譯著了很多反宗教的文獻外，又經常出版一種刊物，以前就呌（戰鬥的無神論者），現在改爲（反宗教者）了。第二要算教育界，在烏克蘭，經常出版的世界語的教育刊物有（教育之路），而以前出版過的（蘇維埃教育雜誌），自經今年七月全蘇聨教育勞動者大會以後，亦有恢復出版的消息。這次大會並决定要以世界語爲教育界國際通信的言語，以交換教育經騐，並决定在各地教育家俱樂部内設世界語班，成立世界語圖書館，開辦世界語函授學社。在體育界方面，明年將在莫斯科舉行的全世界工人運動會的一切口令，亦已决定採用世界語了</p>
<p>最後，得説一説蘇聨世界語者聨盟的情形。它是全世界各國世界語團體中最龐大的組織，在蘇聨内各共和國各都會都設有各别的委員會和小組。在出版方面，蘇聨世界語者聨盟有三個期刊：（國際語）月刊，（在前哨）半月刊，和（蘇聨的眞相）。最近列寗著作集（共十六卷）的譯成世界語的計劃，也在該聨盟的督促下集體地進行着。</p>

<p>去年一月從巴黎還上海，我訪問了德國，波蘭和蘇聨。在凱隆，多得門，哈諾凡爾，萊善齊和瓦沙，我都躭擱了一二天，在柏林和莫斯科各住了一個星期。時間很侷促，而且我又不懂這幾國的語言，然而靠了世界語，我終於遍歷</p>

<h3>（世界語）名稱的由來</h3>
<p>一八八七年柴門霍夫發表（第一書）的時候，他没有用他的眞名字，而用了Ｄ｜roEsperanto（希望者博士）的筆名。對於他的這種文字，他自己也没有給它固定的名稱，只稱它爲LingvoInternacia（國際語）。起初，爲與其他國際語區别起見，大家稱它爲一希望者博士的國際語）。隨後，人們爲方便起見，就用（希望者）（Esperanto）這個名字作爲這種言語的名稱，一直襲用到現在，已放爲這種文字固定的專有的名稱了。二十世紀初年，Esperanto輸入日本，日本人譯爲（世界語），中國人也就用了這個譯名。這是（世界語）這名詞的由來。</p>

<p>這幾個城市，而並無任何困難。我得以知道那裏的生活，尤當是勞動者的生活。一個月的旅行，給我的知識比在大學裏讀三年書更多。要描寫旅行中我所見聞的一切是不可能的。現在我只講些這些城市給我值得注意的印象。　　在這以前，我在歐洲住了三年，已習熟於世界語的生活了。據我的經騐所知，所有的世界語者都是可親的人們。然而無論何處，無論何時，我從未遭遇過在這次旅行中所逢到的熱情。到處人們歡迎我如同上賓，男女同志們招待我有如他們自己的弟兄。不論白天或是晚上，人們帮助我，爲我嚮導，成是邀我到他們的家裏去，並且履行我一切的請求。有幾次人們過分尊敬我，甚至使我有點爲難。　　在這一次旅行中，使我重新得到一個信念，就是勞動者的世界語運動在我們的運動中扮演着主要的角色。第一，從組織方面説。大戰後的勞動者世界語運動，日趨活潑，而現在已跨過了資産者的中立運動了。勞動者世界語者的組織和會員數，已較諸中立的組織更爲强固了。在德國和波蘭，勞動者的世界語團體比那些中立團體更活潑，組織得更好。在蘇聨，蘇聨世界語聨盟也是勞動者的組織，在全世界各國團體中要算是最龐大。據我的經騐，只有勞動者是眞正需要國際語的，只有他們能爲世界語而奮鬥，直到最後的勝利。　　第二，從精神方面來説。大戰之後，所謂（内在理想），所謂（世界語主義）已經死亡，或是説差不多死亡了，而現在却從勞動者的運動中新生了。勞動者的團結性與國際主義給世界語以新的力量，而把它從精神的崩潰中救了出來。我和各國各階級的世界語者的接觸，證實了這個觀點。在西歐，我遇到許多所謂中立的世界語者。只有幾個很老的同志，柴門霍夫的同時代人，是誠懇的，可惜他們年紀都太老，他們太空想而完全不適合現在的情勢，所以他們不能爲我們的運動做什麽了。另一些人學習世界語只是爲了剝削，他們爲了消遣，爲了好奇，爲了營利而使用世界語的。他們再也不願獻身於世界語運動。我碰到資産者的中立世界語者，他們時常問我：（中國人吃不吃狗的？）（你有幾個妻子？）等等。他們以爲是和一個野蠻人在談話。世界語並未改變他們的民族主義的成見。這些高貴的先生稱我爲（同志），實在是個笑話，因爲其實我們之間是無（志）可（同）的。　　勞動者應用世界語爲了他們的抗爭的目的，而不是爲了個人的利益。他們是狂熱的宣傳者，又是唯物的思考者。他們在現實的意識基礎上學習宣傳世界語。他們没有祖國、因之他們之間一切民族的成見是不存在的。當我在勞動者世界語者之間，我覺得我眞正生活在（世界語之國）裏，我的四週都是家人。我在德國波蘭所見到的許多同志，都是爲了我們的運動而供獻了他們全部的時間和貧乏的財産。這在中立世界語運動中再也不會有的。　　德國人是世界上最好的組織家。德國的世界語運動也比了别國組織得更好。我參觀過的地方團體，一切都很有秩序。集會總是有許多人參加。柏林的勞動者世界語運動，是用小組的方法組織的。在許多工廠，工會，學校中，都有世界語者小組的存在，這小組在勞動者之間徴求會員，宣傳和教授世界語。　　在瓦沙我只住了一天，然而却認識了許多世界語者。這裏的同志也爲了失業而受盡艱辛。他們在車站熱烈地歡烈我，並領我去訪問柴門霍夫的墓。從中午到夜裏我在五個集會上出席並演説，二個是勞動者集會，二個是學生的，一個是中立方面的。我在一個呌做（勞動）的集會上深深地感動了，那裏有四百個男女勞動者聽我報告勞動者世界語大會以及中國的情形。遺憾的是時間有限。可是他們不放我走。好容易我才脱出這會塲。這一次我非常疲乏，然而也非常快活。　　經了一天的途程，翌日早晨，我到了莫斯科了。許多男女同志在車站上等候我。我的護照只能經過蘇聨，不得停留的。但靠了莫斯科世界語者的周旋，我得以在莫斯科住一星期。我參觀了工廠，學校，托兒所，公衆食堂，工人住宅，病院，冬宮，列寗墓，劇塲，地方蘇維埃辦事處…等等。要報告我一週内見聞的一切，需要做一本書。　　二月三日我離開莫斯科，八天之後，我又重新回到中國了。</p>
<h3>國際世界語團體　世運的四個國際組織</h3>
<p>— 貢鴻飛</p>
<p>世運國際組織是領導，統一全世界的世界語運動的中央機關，最先成立的是寰球世界語學會。但因運動發展的結果，必然地産生出各種不同的傾向來，而這些不同的傾向在運動上就形成了好幾個各别的國際組織。現在且把這幾個國際組織，以成立的先後爲次序，來分頭叙述一下。　　（一）寰球世界語學會（ＵＥＡ）　　寰球世界語學會（簡稱ＵＥＡ），成立於一九○八年，本是個私人的組織，於一九二二年才成爲正式的國際組織。它的組織方式是以個人會員爲單位的，所以和各國的團體在組織系統上並不發生關係。但自今年科隆大會以後，已改爲以各國團體會員爲單位了。　　照今年的新决定，凡有一百以上的會員的各國團體，即可加入ＡＥＥＵ。但尚無國家團體（如中國）的個人，亦得加入。　　ＵＥＡ除了每年舉行一次寰球世界語大會及出版年鑑及會刊（世界語）外，不見有什麽治動可言。ＵＥＡ的上海代理員爲陳兆瑛君，寓蓬路Ｋ七號。有願加入者，可向陳君接洽。　　（二）全世界無民族學會（ＳＡＴ）　　ＳＡＴ是一個世界語者的左翼的國際組織。ＵＥＡ對於一切都抱着所謂（中立）態度的，ＳＡＴ雖説是左翼的團體，但是對政黨的分派也是守着中立的，所以ＳＡＴ的會員什麽黨派都有，無黨派的也有。　　它成立於一九二一年，由（解放之星）改組而成。其組織類似ＵＥＡ，也以個人會員爲單位。該會曾發行（無民族評論）月刊（一度改名（新時代））及（無民族者）週刊。在一九二九年會員人數曾達七千人，駸駸且駕ＵＥＡ而上之。　　該會自成立起每年也舉行世界大會（今年爲第十三次在Stockholmo舉行）並印行年鑑，儼然與ＵＥＡ成對峙之勢。　　但近年來因幹部人員表示右傾的態度及其所倡導的無民族主義（否定一切爭求民族獨立的爭鬥），遂引起德國蘇聨等左派會員的分裂。會員大爲减少。一面復因留存於蘇聨的錢無法提出，受了非常大的打擊。今年一部份的社會民主派也不滿於其組織方式，又自行另組新團體，其勢力遂更加削弱了。　　現在（無民族者）及（無民族評論）均已放爲月刊。前者每期八面，後者十六面。該會在中國無代理員，其經理部是在德國萊比錫，現恐已遷移。其幹部則在巴黎２３，rue　Boyer,Paris　ＸＸ。　　（三）普洛世界語者國際（ＩＰＥ）　　該國際爲ＳＡＴ的左派分裂而出者所組織。成立於一九三二年。以實用世界語於全球勞働階級解放運動及社會主義建設，統一並領導各普洛世界語團體，普促進國際的人造語之理論，技術和應用爲其任務。而以革命爭鬥，辯證的唯物主義和普洛的國際主義爲基礎。該國際也兼收並容各黨派的普洛世界語者，並不限定一黨一派。　　該國際的組織形式完全和從前的ＵＥＡ與ＳＡＴ不同，是以國爲單位的。凡未有全國組織的國家，始可由個人直接加入。當成立時，計有十八國的會員，共一萬三千人。其會刊爲（國際主義者）半月刊及兩月刊（新階段）。其附設之出版社Ｅkrelo雖成立不久，而出版書籍甚多，巨著如（世界共通語史），（世界語運動分析史）等均是。此外關於普洛文藝，詩歌小説劇本，以及科學的，關於蘇聨兩次五年計劃的書均有。在出版和組織之外，並發動（國際通訊運動）（Ｐck），樹立了堅固的實用的基礎。　　該國際的中央機關本在柏林。因希脱拉的壓迫而被封閉。刊物被禁止出版，出版社亦遭没收。但最近已移至荷蘭AmsterdamZ.Ferdinand　Bolstraat14,k|do　Visser　o其刊物（國際主義者）易名Sur　Posteno，最近也已與（新階段）照常出版。　　（四）社會主義世界語者國際（ＩＳＥ）　　ＳＡＴ自經分裂之後，其會員遂大多數爲社會民主主義派。該派之一部份不滿於其組織形式而主張用國際形式。遂再分裂而組織純粹社會民主主義派的新國際。該國際的最大支持者爲奥地利，德國，捷克，匈牙利，法國等的社會民主主義派的世界語團體。但是同爲社會民主主義派的荷蘭及瑞典的工人世界語團體則反對這個新國際的創立，而主張維持ＳＡＴ。　　ＩＳＥ才成立於今年六月。其會刊爲月刊（社會主義者），此外又擬印行（社會主義者世界語通訊）。該國際是在奥大利WienXXI,Angererstrabei4,Austrio。</p>

        <h1>1933.12.10</h1>
<h3>The Pacification of the Zhejiang-Fujian Border; Xia Pu and Shou Ning are in the Hands of the National Army; No Traces of the Fujian Army in Fuding; Fujian is Gradually Feeling Financial Constraints; Wenzhou Garrison Headquarters Established; Telegram Reports Liu Zhanxiong Appointed Commander for the Zhejiang Attack</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) A telegram from Wenzhou tonight states that Pingyang is peaceful, the Zhejiang-Fujian border defenses are solid, Xia Pu is currently garrisoned by Central [Illegible] troops, Shou Ning is garrisoned by [Illegible] troops, and there are no traces of the Fujian army in Fuding. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Hangzhou states that Yao Cong arrived in Wenzhou from Hangzhou the day before yesterday and established the Garrison Headquarters. Yao is the commander of the Wenzhou Garrison. All areas bordering Zhejiang and Fujian are currently peaceful, with no reports of military contact. Cars can travel from Hangzhou to Wenzhou, which borders Zhejiang and Fujian, in just seven hours. Lu Dipin, the Chairman of Zhejiang, is currently in the provincial capital and is paying close attention to the Fujian border defense, and has not left Hangzhou recently. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Panic and Unrest in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Although the Fujian government is making every effort to reassure the people, the public in Fuzhou remains anxious. It is said that the Fujian government is gradually feeling financially strained. In addition to retaining approximately 255,000 yuan per month from Fujian's customs revenue, taxes on kerosene and automobiles have been doubled, and taxes on foreign rice are also being collected in accordance with Guangdong's regulations. Other taxes, such as salt, alcohol, tobacco, and stamp duties, are not being remitted to Beijing. Furthermore, unified taxes will be levied on coal, matches, cement, and cotton goods, regardless of their origin. Foreign observers now believe that financial difficulties are as likely to cause the collapse of the Fujian government as military action. The British destroyer HMS Verity arrived here today to replace HMS HMS Harebell, but the Japanese cruiser that sailed in at the same time as the British ship was merely on a routine cruise. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Fujian Province to be Divided into Four Districts</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Secretary-General Peng Zexiang stated that the matter of reducing the size of the Fujian province is under review and will be reported to the meeting soon. The general plan is to divide it into provinces such as Northern Fujian, Quanzhou-Hai, Longxi-Zhangzhou, each governing more than ten counties to increase administrative efficiency. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The new government plans to divide Fujian into four provinces, submitting it for review, namely: Fujian Maritime, Fujian Upper, Quanzhou Maritime, and Longxi-Zhangzhou. The district areas will follow the original Yanping-Jianning, Xiamen-Zhangzhou-Longyan, and four Daos. However, the former island of Xiamen will be independent as a special municipality. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumors of the Fujian Army Attacking Zhejiang in Two Routes</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Fujian People's Government has decided to attack Zhejiang in two routes. One route will advance towards Northern Fujian, and the other route will advance through Sandu and Funing. The frontline military is under the command of Liu Zhanxiong, the commander of the 1st Division of the 1st Army. Liu came to Fuzhou from Southern Fujian, and after discussing matters with Cai Tingkai, he went to Yanping on the 8th, intending to coordinate combat work with Shen Guanghan. The Independent 1st Gan Army of Chen Zhaixuan is currently moving towards Lianjiang and Luoyuan, and its goal seems to be Funing. (9th, Japan United News)</p>
<h3>Observations on the Fujian Situation from Various Parties</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Many representatives from various parties have come here to observe the current situation. A special correspondent from Reuters met with Jiang Kanghu and representatives sent by the Guizhou province authorities. Their views were the same as those expressed by Yu Xinqing, the representative of Feng Yuxiang, all stating that the Fujian government has in fact allied with the Communists. Fuzhou is covered with slogans opposing attacks on Zhu De and resisting Japan, yet the authorities deny any connection with the Communist Party and acknowledge that resisting Japan is tantamount to suicide. They apparently believe that Japan will not invade and occupy Fuzhou because of these slogans. One observer compared the new government to child's play, and another said that Cai Tingkai, with an army of only 50,000 men, many of whom are new recruits, actually wants to challenge Nanjing. The hotels are now full of Guangdong people seeking opportunities, and the general public believes that if Guangdong province does not respond quickly, the independence movement will undoubtedly fail. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Department Claims Fujian is Allied with the Communists</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information from the Japanese military department, the Fujian government does indeed have close relations with the Communist army. On October 20th, Cai Tingkai sent a certain Mr. Tian to Ruijin to discuss a defense alliance with Peng Dehuai and signed a six-article agreement. The contents are as follows: (1) The Communist Party is responsible for the construction of the areas occupied by the Communist army, and both sides will not invade each other. (2) If the Guangdong army attacks Fujian, the People's Government must provide the Red Army with 300,000 yuan in military expenses, and both sides will jointly deal with Chen Jitang. (3) Both sides will unanimously oppose imperialism and the National Government. (4) The People's Government must lift the economic blockade of the Soviet area. (5) Promote the mass movement to make the masses the vanguard of the revolution. (6) The People's Government must establish a worker-peasant regime. (9th, China United News)</p>
<h3>Western Missionaries Withdraw from Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Most of the foreigners in Northern Fujian are Americans, numbering over 140, with about 30 each from Britain and France. The majority are missionaries. Seeing the dangerous situation and the poor discipline of the newly recruited Fujian soldiers, who often have disputes with local churches, the Western missionaries have successively withdrawn from Northern Fujian to the major ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou. The British and American consulates have confirmed this, stating that the withdrawal was a voluntary act by the foreign nationals and not an order from the British or American consulates in Fuzhou.

<p>[P] Income Tax and Inheritance Tax of the Ministry of Finance [P]</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Binggang, the director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, spoke about the plan of the Ministry of Finance to levy inheritance tax and income tax. The central government has a plan for levying income tax, but it has not yet been implemented. The nature is similar to the current income donation of civil servants, and it is not levied on ordinary people. Also, the amount of surplus at the end of each year for major domestic banks, shops, factories, and companies will be used to determine the amount of tax to be levied. At this time of tight national treasury and imminent foreign troubles, various business circles have made huge profits under the protection of the government, and it is thought that they will be happy to pay. The scope and amount of the tax to be levied are currently being drafted and submitted to the Minister for review, and will be decided by the Legislative Yuan in the future. Regarding the issue of levying inheritance tax, the central government has also thought about it long ago. Various countries have been implementing it for a long time. Due to the fact that our country's household registration law has not yet been effectively implemented, it is especially difficult to conduct accurate investigations, so it has not been possible to implement it until now. It is now being handed over to the Legislative Yuan for decision. It is expected that this matter will be implemented sooner or later. The draft is drafted by adopting the advantages of the inheritance tax measures of various countries, and the content is very detailed. After this tax is implemented, the inheritance rights of the people can be guaranteed, and disputes over inheritance can be avoided. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary: Italy and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>After Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference and severed ties with the League of Nations, the situation in Europe has become increasingly tense. Although war may not break out immediately, the atmosphere of unease is growing stronger. Germany insists on its demand for equality in armaments, arguing that it cannot be left defenseless when surrounded by powerful nations. Therefore, it expresses its full resistance to the unfair treatment of the Treaty of Versailles and will devote itself to military construction. At the same time, France, during this period, has not expressed the same strong sentiments as Germany, but it regards "security guarantees" as an iron rule, equivalent to the second spirit of its nation. The reason for its calmness is to see to what extent Germany will expand its naval, land, and air forces. However, there is one crucial factor: In the capitalist world, Italy holds a key position in the Mediterranean, is a giant in Central Europe, and is a strong rival to France in North Africa. If Germany and Italy were to unite, the Treaty of Versailles would be fundamentally shaken, and France would inevitably face multiple enemies. On the other hand, there is also the socialist Soviet Union, which controls the key to the struggles between European powers. If it helps Germany, Germany will not only have great diplomatic advantages but also gain some economic advantages. Militarily, it will also reduce its worries about its eastern flank. Therefore, France does not hesitate to abandon its long-standing anti-Soviet policy and instead enters into a non-aggression treaty with it. This is a diplomatic success for France. If Germany advocates anti-Sovietism at this time, it will inevitably isolate itself.</p>
<p>Italy recognizes the importance of its position and also considers the weakness of its own economic strength. It fears that it will be unable to sincerely unite with Germany. The nationalism in Europe has become mutually incompatible. Conflicts between peoples cannot be reconciled for a time, and economic interests are mutually exclusive. Moreover, fascist states have reached the peak in the form of national organization, making it difficult to achieve honest cooperation. They can only be used temporarily. Italy is aware of this point and uses the opportunity of conflict between Germany and France to join hands with the Soviet Union, which has extremely opposing principles, to increase its advantages in the struggle for hegemony in Central Europe. At the same time, the satellite states in the Versailles treaty system—small countries under French influence—will all be somewhat affected. Italy can freely control the Dalmatian area on the Adriatic coast. The countries in the Danube River basin, which follow France's lead, will also look to Italy's face. Even Germany will have to rely on Italy to restrain France. This is why Italy is making every effort to take advantage of Germany's withdrawal from the League to maximize its influence.</p>
<p>As for the League of Nations, its original covenant proclaimed itself as a messenger of peace, transforming hostility into harmony. The key lies in the operation of the League of Nations. Unexpectedly, after the September 18th Incident, the sanctity of all international treaties was torn apart by Japan. The League of Nations itself lacked the strength to maintain treaties, and the major participating countries could not make fair judgments. As a result, the League of Nations' credibility plummeted. Recently, Germany, the target of the Treaty of Versailles, has also left the League of Nations, turning the League of Nations into a useless tool, losing its role in discussing right and wrong and mediating diplomacy.</p>
<p>At this time, in order to strengthen its international position and seize European hegemony, Italy proposed reorganizing the League of Nations and expanding the Four-Power Pact, inviting the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan to participate. If this were to succeed, Italy, which manipulates between France and Germany, would transform into a major power leading Europe. However, at present, the relationship between Britain and France is not very bad, and they can maintain a consistent pace towards Germany. France will never allow Italy to lead alone, and Britain is unwilling to allow Italy to do whatever it wants. The Soviet Union's goodwill towards Italy is only a temporary expedient. How could it not take precautions? The United States will not easily abandon its Monroe Doctrine and join the new League of Nations advocated by Italy in the midst of entanglements, thus destroying its traditional position. As for the small countries in Central Europe, they will inevitably observe the situation and wait for the changes in reality. In this case, Italy's plan to reorganize the League of Nations can only express Italy's ambition, but its practicality is minimal.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Forestry Advisory Council</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to actively promote forestry, increase material production, and recover rights and interests, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station has specially organized the Forestry Advisory Council as the highest design organ for forestry experiments. The regulations have been drafted and approved by the Ministry of Industry for implementation. The council has now been prepared and organized, and the first establishment meeting was held at 9:00 AM on the 9th at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Cui Ba Lane. Attendees included Qian Tianhe, Ling Daoyang, Gao Bingfang, Chen Rong, Pi Zuoqiong, Yao Chuanfa, Li Yingong, Shen Pengfei, Hu Duo, Lin Gang, and others, totaling more than ten people. After the meeting, Qian Tianhe, the deputy director of the station, delivered a speech on behalf of Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, and reported on the organization of the council. Ling Daoyang, the president of the council, gave a speech on (the importance of forestry experiments) and proposed the council's research direction and the urgently needed equipment. The most important items were (1) establishing a forest botanical garden, (2) planning a national experimental area and a Nanjing erosion test site, and (3) formulating application standard testing instruments. The attendees unanimously approved these items. Then, they discussed cooperation with the Yellow River and Huai River water conservancy agencies and various agricultural and forestry universities, and elected Hu Duo as the secretary-general of the council. According to the person in charge of the council, the forestry experiment matters will be stepped up in the future so that they can be promoted nationwide in accordance with the plan outline and achieve good results.

<h3>Regarding Proposals for Reforming the League of Nations, France Clearly States That the Rights of Member States Should Be Respected Equally and the Main Foundation of the League of Nations Should Not Be Shaken. Hitler Formally Asks France to Revise the Treaty and Achieve Equality in Armaments, and Says That Returning the Saar Can Permanently Eliminate Wars Between the Two Countries.</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Pang Gu routinely met with reporters covering diplomatic affairs. Someone asked Pang Gu for his opinion on the reorganization of the League of Nations. Pang Gu replied that France's policy over the past ten years has been sufficient to prove France's unwavering loyalty to the League of Nations. Regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations, no concrete plan has yet reached the French government. If someone proposes reorganizing the League of Nations for the sake of adapting to the times, we are prepared to consider it. However, the League of Nations is based on the foundation that the rights of all countries are fully respected. No matter how it is reformed, it must be on the condition that this foundation is not shaken. The League of Nations is the foundation of French foreign policy. No matter what, we will never allow it to be directly or indirectly harmed. This is known to everyone. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Pang Gu issued an important statement today, declaring the French government's attitude towards the reorganization of the League of Nations. The most important point of Pang Gu's statement is France's unwavering loyalty to the League of Nations. The French government has not yet received any suggestions for reorganizing the League of Nations. When it receives them in the future, it will give them due consideration. Pang Gu said that the organizational law of the League of Nations has indeed been amended in several places. For example, Chapters 4, 6, 12, and 13 are no longer the original texts. If further changes are indeed necessary in the future, France will naturally be happy to comply. However, the fundamental principles of the establishment of the League of Nations should be maintained to the end. Pang Gu added that the League of Nations has pleasantly implemented the principle of equality among nations. As far as France is concerned, this principle can be attacked. Therefore, what France wants to warn its friendly countries is that future reforms must not abolish the principle of permanent members of the Council and replace it with a complete form of democracy. Today, as in the past, there must be no existence of strong powers manipulating the League of Nations itself. As the current treaties all rely on the existence of the League of Nations as a basis, if the League of Nations collapses, all treaties, including the Four-Power Pact, must be renegotiated. Pang Gu concluded by saying, (For this reason, it can be seen that we cannot allow any slightest changes in the League of Nations, whether directly or indirectly.) (8th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>▲France Tries to Win Over the Little Entente Countries. Pang Gu Will Travel to Eastern Europe.</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Pang Gu will soon travel to various countries in Eastern and Southeastern Europe to strengthen friendships. The French newspapers were greatly surprised but did not comment. They only said that recent events have forced France to discuss the new situation with its trustworthy friends. The recent events they are referring to are clearly Italy's memorandum on reorganizing the League of Nations. According to neutral observers, Italy's memorandum has forced France to engage in self-defense. Pang Gu has become increasingly active recently, partly due to fear of being isolated. The Petit Parisien, which has close ties with the Foreign Minister, has published an article warning the government not to lightly negotiate with Germany before the Anglo-French alliance can be guaranteed and it has been agreed with London what action to take if direct Franco-German talks are unsuccessful. (8th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>▲A "Super League of Nations" is Difficult for France to Accept. U.S. Officials Are Unwilling to Make a Hasty Decision.</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is widely believed that Mussolini's plan to reorganize the League of Nations will allow the United States to handle American affairs, Japan and Russia to handle Far Eastern affairs, and Germany, France, Britain, and Italy to handle European affairs. U.S. officials have not yet made a final decision on this "Super League of Nations" plan, but some already believe that it will be rejected because they expect France to refuse to accept this approach, causing France to lose the guarantee of its trade security as stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>▲Rome Has Changed Its Opinion on the Proposed League of Nations.</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations, according to news from Rome, the intentions of the Fascist Party Congress seem to have changed. The Congress originally wanted the major powers to control everything and abolish the equal status of all countries within the League of Nations. Now, it is not as insistent on this point as before. The reason is probably because Litvinov indicated that the Soviet Union was unwilling to participate in the controlling mechanism that Italy wanted to organize. The change in the intentions of the Fascist Party seems to be welcomed by Britain because the principle of equality among nations is what Britain strongly desires to maintain.

<h3>▲Disarmament Talks Proceeding Outside the Conference.</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon met with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson today, but the content of the talks is unknown. However, two things prove that the situation of the Disarmament Conference is still uncertain. What the external spokespersons are talking about is just a way to muddle through the situation. What are these two things? First, the French and Italian ambassadors are still in contact with the British government today. Second, the U.S. ambassador to Germany has requested a meeting with German Chancellor Hitler. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Simon's meeting with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson today further highlights the importance of the disarmament talks currently taking place in various European capitals. British Ambassador to France Tyrrell is currently in London and also met with Simon today. The British government is now using the power of its ambassadors to separately contact German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. It is widely believed that the talks between London authorities, Tyrrell, and Henderson are closely related to the exchange of views on diplomatic issues after the disarmament adjournment, and especially related to German Chancellor Hitler's recent talks with the French ambassador to Germany. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond will arrive in Britain on Sunday for a brief visit. At that time, he will meet with Simon and give a speech to Members of Parliament. Drummond is traveling from Geneva to London tonight, passing through Paris to have a discussion with French Foreign Minister Pang Gu. On Sunday, British Foreign Minister Simon will host a tea party in the House of Commons to welcome him. The discussions currently taking place in London and other capitals are based on the proposal passed by the Disarmament Steering Committee last month to exchange views on diplomatic issues in order to promote the work of the Disarmament Conference. Henderson told people today that he has serious concerns about the current situation, saying that the collective peace system is in danger. He hopes that the current exchange of views can make international agreement possible. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>▲Germany Asks France to Revise the Treaty.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler personally handed Germany's demands to the French Ambassador to Berlin for transmission to the French government. The French government has received the document today. Although the content of the conditions has not been made public, it has been officially confirmed that the content is roughly the same as what Hitler has stated in the past, namely, demanding the revision of the Treaty of Versailles and equality in armaments, and stating that if France agrees to return the Saar region to Germany, then there will never be war between Germany and France. The French government now plans to formally respond to Germany's demands after the parliamentary financial debate is completed, but it must wait for the British Ambassador to France to return from London with his report and exchange views with Czech Foreign Minister Benes on Thursday before sending it out. It is still preparing to have the French Ambassador to Berlin transmit it to Hitler. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>▲Italian Undersecretary Visits Berlin to Return the Courtesy.</h3>
<p>The visit of Italian Foreign Undersecretary Suvich to Berlin to return the courtesy can be seen as a scene in the international negotiations scheduled during the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference, and even more directly as a scene in the negotiations between Italy and Germany after Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. This kind of negotiation between Italy and Germany was initiated by Prussian Prime Minister Goering's visit to Rome. Suvich's visit to Berlin was at the invitation of the German government. The intention was conveyed to Mussolini by German Ambassador to Italy Hassell when he returned to Rome from Berlin the day before yesterday. On the occasion of Suvich's visit to Berlin, it can be said that Italy seems to be prepared to allow Germany to double its current forces in principle. However, after Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov met with Mussolini, perhaps Suvich used the different views of the Soviet Union as an excuse to restrain Germany's demands.

<h3>Little Entente Unity Shows Significant Progress Towards Rapprochement</h3>
<p>The King and Queen of Bulgaria, accompanied by the Prime Minister, are scheduled to arrive here this Sunday afternoon to visit the authorities of Yugoslavia and stay for three days. In recent months, a large-scale movement for mutual rapprochement has been underway among the Balkan countries. It began with the meeting of the Kings of Yugoslavia and Romania. The King of Yugoslavia then visited Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece. Later, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu traveled throughout the Balkan Peninsula and to Turkey. At the same time, the Prime Ministers of Bulgaria and Greece also made considerable moves. The purpose of this movement is to organize peace through national cooperation. According to well-informed sources, during the meeting between the two Kings of Yugoslavia and Romania, the Balkan Pact recently proposed by Yugoslavia will be studied. This pact is based on the following conditions: maintaining the status quo of the territories of the Balkan countries for several years, and Yugoslavia granting Bulgaria various economic benefits as compensation. (8th Havas Dispatch) Individuals from all walks of life in Bulgaria who support the movement to get closer to France have made significant progress recently. The general public is quite satisfied with the King and Queen and Prime Minister Mushanov's upcoming visit to Yugoslavia. This trip is only intended to create an environment of mutual trust between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria for the time being. The concrete effects will have to wait for the future. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Selection of Japanese Ambassador to the United States: Hirota Prefers Saito Hiroshi.</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, with the completion of the Five-Minister Conference, the resolution of the budget issue, and the stability of the domestic political situation, has decided to carry out active diplomatic work.

As a result of consideration, it has been decided to promote a rising diplomat from within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It has been internally decided to appoint Saito Hiroshi, the current Minister to the Netherlands, as the new Ambassador to the United States. (9th Rengo Dispatch)</p>
<h3>World Unanimously Resists Japanese Goods; Japan Secretly Complains Bitterly; Foreign Ministry Issues Statement Saying It Will Revise Tariffs in Retaliation; India-Japan Trade Conference on the Verge of Rupture; Minister of Commerce Advises Business Circles to Make Concessions to India</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese goods are being resisted everywhere. French Indochina has begun to restrict the import of Japanese goods. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, angered by the resistance of various countries, issued a statement today saying that it will take tough measures to deal with the situation. The content is roughly as follows: Recently, various countries in the world have been particularly sensitive to Japanese goods, either raising tariffs, limiting the number of imports, or advocating the abolition of commercial treaties, doing everything possible to exert pressure. However, Japan is still enduring this and observing this general trend, believing that it is an unavoidable measure due to domestic circumstances. Therefore, it is trying its best to cooperate with various countries, while stepping up the implementation of trade controls, restricting the export of Japanese goods, such as cement, beer, and light bulbs, all of which are on the list of restrictions. A Trade Deliberation Council will be established to review and determine the methods of restriction. For various commodities, merchants will be organized into export associations to implement strict controls. Japan will adopt a free trade policy for foreign goods, treating all countries with equal tariffs. If various countries still do not understand Japan's difficulties, it will take retaliatory tariff measures to deal with them. The Foreign Ministry plans to submit a tariff revision bill in the next session of the Diet. (9th, China United News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Osaka: The Minister of Commerce, Mr. Nakajima, arrived in Osaka from Japan at 8:56 this morning. At noon, he held a government-business conference with textile industry representatives in Kansai at the Cotton Industry Hall. The Japanese Foreign Ministry sent Secretary Wakasugi to participate. The government requested the business community to make concessions, saying that the threatening statement issued by the textile industry on the 28th had made the environment even worse, and the attitude of other countries had become tougher. Moreover, because the India-Japan conference had broken down, the losses suffered by general merchandise merchants were enormous. In order to protect the overall interests of the Japanese side, it is hoped that Japanese businesses will leave the matter entirely to the government to resolve.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a report to the Foreign Ministry from the Consul-General in Hanoi, Annam, the Annam government issued a proclamation on November 25, ordering that naturally occurring mineral water, Hirano water, and 布引 (Nunobiki - Kobe) carbonated water produced in Japan be imported through Haiphong and Saigon. The import volume is limited to within 138 cubic meters per year. (9th, Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>Osaka: This year's joint government-business conference held at the Osaka Cotton Industry Hall has convened. Minister of Commerce Nakajima clarified the urgency of the international situation, stating that it is not appropriate to antagonize all sides and that the interests of general merchandise merchants must be taken into account. He requested that textile industry representatives unconditionally entrust the matter to the government for resolution. Foreign Ministry Secretary Wakasugi also reported on the information received by the Foreign Ministry, stating that a compromise would be beneficial. Committee Chairman Abe described the process of contacting the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Commerce and Industry in Tokyo and advocated leaving the matter entirely to the government for decision. Tsuda criticized the failure of diplomacy and opposed unconditionally entrusting the matter to the government. The two sides argued for four hours without reaching a resolution. At 4:00 PM, Minister of Commerce Nakajima was asked to leave the meeting, and discussions continued for another hour and a half. It was then decided to request the government to handle the matter appropriately, removing the words "unconditionally" and replacing them with "appropriately". In reality, this is no different from entrusting the matter entirely to the government for decision. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Japanese government can accept India's amended proposal.

<h3>Matsuoka's Withdrawal from the Party - Only by Fundamentally Destroying Existing Political Parties Can the Showa Restoration Be Realized</h3>
<p>Kozu statement: After resigning from the Seiyukai and the House of Representatives, and impacting the political world, Matsuoka Yosuke traveled west from Tokyo yesterday to attend a lecture at the Jiangdao Veterans Association. After the lecture, he returned to his hometown in Yamaguchi Prefecture and will return to Tokyo on the 16th. In the train, he told reporters: Since returning from freedom in Geneva, after reflecting deeply on the internal and external situation, I have reached the conclusion that political parties must be dissolved. Today's decisive action is like the sky in early winter; my heart feels extremely unburdened. If today's political parties are not dissolved, how can the Showa Restoration be achieved? It is also heard that Matsuoka will open the Matsuoka Juku in Mita, Tokyo, to focus on educating young people. (9th, Dentsu telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Matsuoka Yosuke's withdrawal from the Seiyukai and resignation from the House of Representatives, although the military is avoiding overt criticism, they generally view it with the following goodwill: The reality of the current political parties is indeed as stated by Matsuoka Yosuke and cannot be reformed. Even if it can be reformed, it would require five or ten years of long days and months. Even without relying on political parties, it is possible to carry out constitutional politics. Therefore, at this extraordinary time, when the situation is pressing, Matsuoka's actions and even his statement are not surprising. Why did these actions occur within the ranks of the political parties? This is something that political parties should deeply reflect on. This reflection is not only for the country but also the first step for the regeneration of the political parties themselves. (9th, Dentsu telegram)</p>
<h3>Spain - Anarchist Party Riot - Spreading Leaflets to Incite Revolution - National State of Alert Declared</h3>
<p>Madrid: Last night, in the Spanish provinces of Catalonia and Zaragoza, anarchist groups suddenly launched terrorist riots. The situation is serious and may become the prelude to a new revolutionary action. According to news received here this morning, late last night, the headquarters of the anarchist party in Barcelona suddenly issued leaflets and pamphlets, urging the people to rise up in revolution in order to abolish property and currency. As a result, almost the entire province of Catalonia and Zaragoza experienced weak riots, with terrorist acts such as throwing bombs and shooting guns continuing throughout the night, causing many deaths and injuries. Anarchist elements also took the opportunity to carry out large-scale acts of sabotage in secret, such as destroying railways in Jura, causing a train to derail, killing several people and injuring many others, and destroying several power plants and cutting off all telegraph and telephone lines. As far as is currently known, at least seven civilians and two security guards have been killed. It is expected that the number of deaths and injuries will far exceed this once transportation is fully restored. As for the number of injured, at the beginning of the riots, ten police officers and security guards and six civilians were seriously injured. The central government has ordered the police and security guards to mobilize and station themselves in important areas of the two provinces to prevent the incident from escalating after dawn.

<h3>Li Zeyi - Talks About Returning from a Trip to Japan - Claims He Was Not Appointed by Anyone to Go to Japan</h3>
<p>Inquiring About the Japanese Side's Attitude After the Armistice: A Beiping Dispatch: Li Zeyi, a member of the War Zone Reception Committee, returned to Beiping from Shenyang the day before yesterday and visited Huang Fu to report on his trip to Japan. Yesterday morning (6th), he went to Tianjin. Fujiwara, the naval attache of the Japanese embassy, accompanied him. Before going to Tianjin, Li gave a speech, stating: "Since the September 18th Incident, I have traveled to Japan fourteen times. During my thirteenth trip to Japan in February of this year, Japanese newspapers made various speculations, referring to me as a secret envoy of the central authorities. In fact, I have traveled east several times on my own initiative and was not appointed by anyone. Seeing the various fratricidal conflicts, I feared that they would develop into the tragedy of whites killing each other during the European War. Therefore, driven by conscience, I did not hesitate to travel many times, eager to study the true situation on the Japanese side and seek ways to remedy the situation. This time, because I had previously attended the armistice agreement, Chinese and Japanese newspapers made many speculations, believing that this trip must contain an important mission. I might as well describe this mission: (1) There are still unfinished matters regarding the construction of the Ninghai warship that I handled last year, which must be cleared up. (2) My young son is receiving treatment in Tokyo, and I eagerly wanted to visit him. (3) Having attended the armistice agreement, it was necessary to know in detail the attitude of the other side after the armistice. Therefore, I asked Commissioners Huang and He for leave to go, still traveling in a private capacity. I expressed this intention to Japanese reporters when passing through Nagasaki. The so-called 'no mission but work' is what I meant. As for returning via Changchun, I wanted to inspect the latest situation of the war goods and the situation along the Beining Railway. Our country has always valued etiquette. Given the courteous reception on the other side, it was impossible not to reciprocate. When I arrived in Shenyang, I visited the spirit of General Zhang Zuolin, remembering the old friend and expressing my respect. Foreign reports have called me an envoy of justice, which is an exaggeration." At 7:15 this evening (7th), Mr. Li and his family returned to Beiping from Tianjin. He told reporters that his trip to Tianjin was to bid farewell to Naval Attache Fujiwara on his return to his country, entirely a private courtesy. After Fujiwara leaves China, his successor will be Naval Attache Nakano, who has not yet arrived in China. He is now returning to China and is overwhelmed with secular affairs and has not yet reported the details of his trip to the east to Commissioner Huang. Therefore, he is rushing back to Beiping and will visit Commissioner Huang at 8:00 tonight to report everything and will visit Commissioner He tomorrow (8th). As for the Yuguan reception and the establishment of customs at various passes along the Great Wall, I have been back in Beiping for a short time and have not heard anything about it. (7th)</p>
<h3>North China Military Expenses - Distributed According to 4 Million - Local Contribution Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>Paid at 60% Starting Next January: A Beiping Dispatch: During Zhang Xueliang's administration, the North China military expenses were 4.5 million, and during the war with Japan, they increased to 7.5 million. After the cessation of hostilities, they were reduced once, but they still required more than 5 million. Local contributions were affected by the war and could not be delivered as scheduled, resulting in huge arrears and extreme difficulties. The central and North China military authorities, recognizing the financial difficulties and the inability to maintain the situation in the long term, convened a meeting of generals to reduce expenses through the Military Sub-Committee. It was decided to restore the original budget of 4.5 million, to be paid once every 36 days, for a total of 10 payments per year. Recently, due to the fact that local revenues still cannot be delivered in full, the deficit is still huge. The authorities, considering that the current year is coming to an end and the 23rd year is about to begin, proposed a new regulation. The central government subsidizes 3.39 million per month, and local contributions are as follows: Hebei Province originally contributed 500,000, Chahar 300,000, the Beining Railway 150,000, the Pingsui Railway 50,000, Beiping City 50,000, and Tianjin City 60,000, totaling 4.5 million. However, the governments of the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar, due to the sharp decline in revenue after the war, were unable to raise the funds and sought a reduction. The Beiping Municipal Government also stated that its revenue was very small and it was unable to bear the burden. The North China military authorities are now consulting with all parties again and have decided that the central government will still subsidize 3.39 million per month, Hebei Province's contribution will be reduced from 500,000 to 200,000, Chahar will be reduced to 120,000, the Beining and Pingsui Railways will remain the same, Tianjin City will remain at 60,000, and Beiping City will be reduced to 30,000, for a total of 4 million per month. This amount will be distributed to the various armies, and it is planned to be paid monthly starting from January 1 next year, approximately 60% of the amount. After the Military Sub-Committee discussed the proposal at its 31st and 32nd regular meetings, it was handed over to the Finance and Supervision Committee to study the detailed measures. At 10:00 AM today (4th), the Finance and Supervision Committee convened a meeting at the Jurentang, attended by He Yingqin, Yu Xuezhong, Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Gu Bingxun, Jiang Bocheng, He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Sun Dianying (represented by Wang Shiping), Xie Gangzhe, Wei Zonghan, Cao Shengyue, Deputy Director of the Third Department of the Military Sub-Committee, Shen Zhenrong, Head of the Ninth Group, and more than 20 other people. He Yingqin chaired the meeting. Regarding the distribution of military expenses, He Yingqin reported that the North China military expenses are subsidized by the central government at 3.39 million per month, and the local contribution was originally set at 1.1 million, totaling 4.5 million. However, due to the current financial difficulties in the local area, at most only half of the 1.1 million local contribution can be delivered, totaling approximately 4 million per month. It is necessary to spend according to this amount each month in order to balance the income and expenditure. In the past, the salaries of the various units were paid 10 times a year, and each time they received 80% of the fixed amount, only actually receiving 56% of the fixed amount. After several days of discussion, two solutions have been proposed: (A) Starting from January of the 23rd year, pay salaries monthly, actually paying 12 times a year, to avoid the complexity of accounting; (B) Distribute all of the 4 million in income, temporarily loaning 60% of the fixed amount to each unit as subsistence expenses, and the remaining arrears will be paid after the funds are sufficient. After discussion, there were no objections from the public, and it was resolved to pass the principles. Detailed distribution measures will be reviewed and determined at the next meeting based on the new and old budgets of each unit. Two additional issues were discussed: (1) Regarding the local contribution to the North China military expenses, the Beining Railway contributed 150,000 per month, the Pingsui Railway 50,000, Tianjin City 60,000, Hebei Province was originally set to contribute 500,000, and Chahar 300,000. All of these were unable to be delivered as scheduled due to financial difficulties. The two provincial authorities should submit solutions. Yu Xuezhong and Song Zheyuan, the chairmen of the two provinces of Ji and Cha, reported separately on the financial difficulties of their respective provinces after the war. After discussion, it was decided that starting from January of next year, Hebei Province will contribute 200,000 per month and Chahar will contribute 120,000 per month, totaling 3.97 million including the central and local contributions, 30,000 short of the monthly expenditure of 4 million. It was decided that the Beiping Municipal Government should be responsible for paying its contribution of 50,000 per month to make up the difference. (2) The salaries of the various units in North China this year have only been paid up to the sixth installment. The seventh installment will be raised and paid in the next few days. Since the new salary regulations will be implemented starting from January of next year, how should the three installments of salaries that are owed this year be paid? After public discussion, it was decided to first clear the public expenses owed to the various units by the end of this year, and then submit the remaining arrears to the central government for instructions. The meeting adjourned at approximately 12:00. (December 4)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Army Clears Out - Remnants of Bandits on the South Bank of the Qu River - Army and Air Force Mobilized Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Orders General Attack on Sui and Xuan: A Hankou Dispatch: The military operations to suppress bandits in Sichuan Province can be divided into three stages in the past month. Initially, the bandit forces were rampant, and the national army was not assembled, so they did not fight back for the time being and only sought to protect themselves. This was the defensive stage. Afterwards, the various armies were fully equipped, but they had not achieved communication, with some attacking, some defending, some winning, and some losing. This was the semi-offensive and semi-defensive stage. Recently, all the armies have bravely advanced, thwarting the main force of the bandits and seizing the key areas of the bandits, which is the stage of a full-scale general offensive. Among them, the fighting in the Qu River basin was the fiercest, and the number of bandits killed was also the highest. According to the combined Sichuan telegrams of recent days, the various units of Wang Lingji, Fan Shaozeng, Li Qixiang, and Liao Zhen launched a general offensive along the Qu River line starting on the 1st. The Seventh Brigade of the Third Division of Wang's unit advanced from Yongxingchang towards Shamaojian and Bajiaochang, recovering Liangfeng'e and Yanmenzi. The Eighth Brigade and the Guard Regiment advanced from Huilongchang and Changtianba towards Beilixia and Sandengpo, recovering Xishanpo and Sandengpo. The Ninth Brigade advanced from Dashiqiao towards Tingzipu, recovering Gancao'e. The two brigades of the Fourth Division of Fan's unit advanced from Shiban Dian, Chumu Gupo, and Erlangmiao towards Liangjiaozhai and Jigongliang, recovering Woniushan and Caijiaping. At the same time, Li Qixiang's unit occupied Hantianba, Qiangjiashan, and Tongzizhen, and Liao Zhen's unit occupied Mengjiaheba. All routes made progress. The Air Force assisted with bombing with three aircraft, killing even more bandits. The bandits in this area were the three armies of the pseudo-Fourth Army, Ninth Army, and Twenty-ninth Army, which were originally elite troops. Because of repeated counterattacks, they suffered heavy losses. Once threatened by the army and air force, they felt overwhelmed. The majority retreated to Suicheng, and some defended the river. On the 3rd and 4th, the battle resumed. Fan's unit broke through Tianbaozhai, Yangliuye, Chajiezi, Lanjingba, Caojiezi, Jigongliang, and Leiyinpu, completely defeating the entire pseudo-Eighty-eighth Division and a part of the pseudo-Twenty-first Army waiting for reinforcements, as well as a regiment of the volunteer army and several teams of guerrillas. Wang's unit and the two brigades of Zhou and Liu of the Twenty-third Army once again captured Xishanpo and Sandengpo after a bloody battle, and occupied the key areas of Shamaojian and Bajiaochang. The bandits on the south bank of the Qu River were in an increasingly dangerous situation. On the 5th, the various armies gathered on the south bank of the Qu River, occupying Shuanghepu, Zhangjiayan, Yaochang, and Xia Bamiao. The bandit's base was completely lost, and they retreated to defend the north bank. The remnants of the bandits on the south bank were thus cleared out. In the various battles, a total of more than 2,600 bandits were killed. More than 20 pseudo-political personnel and dozens of military officers were captured in Shuanghepu, and more than 10 pseudo-political personnel were captured in Sandengpo. Bandit soldiers are being captured and investigated. Liu Xiang, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in Sichuan Province, considered the Qu River as a barrier for Sui and Xuan. With its recovery, Sui and Xuan could be threatened. He decided to order the various units of Wang, Liao, Fan, Li, Yang, and Luo to quickly seize the north bank and launch a general attack on Suiding and Xuanhan. The Air Force has been ordered to depart first to bomb and destroy the Xuanhan pontoon bridge to disrupt the bandit's rear. He also ordered Deng and Tian Lu to launch a joint attack on Nanba and Yilong immediately to achieve an encirclement effect. (7th)</p>
<h3>Xu Yuanquan's Telegram: Heavy Losses Inflicted on He Long's Band; He Long Severely Wounded</h3>
<p>Chiang's telegraphic order commends Nanchang Communications; Jiangxi Operations Headquarters received successive telegrams yesterday from Chief Commander Xu, stating that according to successive telegrams from Zhang Gang, commander of the Security Regiment, the regiment led by Hu Xienan engaged in a fierce four-hour battle with over 3,000 bandits under He Long's command at Shangdongping, southwest of Xuan'en, with several hand-to-hand combats. Eventually, the bandit forces suffered a major defeat and fled in disarray for over ten miles towards Woxiping, Mayangzhai Longping, Maheba, and other places. The bandit division commander, Tang Yuzong, was killed on the spot, and over 400 bandit soldiers were killed. He Long was also severely wounded and escaped amidst the chaos. They are currently tracking and pursuing, aiming to annihilate them. It was requested that Commander Hu's regiment be commended for defeating a larger force and killing a bandit division commander, as well as severely wounding He Long, to encourage them. Upon receiving the telegram, Chairman Chiang immediately ordered a commendation to be issued and for a list of those who contributed to the battle to be submitted for awards. Furthermore, military intelligence states: (1) The puppet 357th Army Corps and the puppet Independent 3rd Division have been holding meetings in the Xiongcun area recently. The puppet 3rd Army Corps is stationed in Xiongcun, while the 57th Army Corps is stationed on either side, shouting slogans, including those against the 19th Route Army and those coerced into submission. Upon receiving this information, the National Army dispatched aircraft to bomb the area, killing countless puppet officers and soldiers on the spot. The remainder fled into the mountains. (2) In the Le'an area, near Taipingxu Sanxing, approximately 1,000 members of the puppet Independent Regiment were attacked by our air force this afternoon and subsequently fled to Dengtianqiao. Furthermore, the puppet guerrilla force of Zhao Gongzhan, consisting of approximately 200 men, was dispersed by our guerrilla forces. (3) In the Jiangnan area, part of the 64th Regiment of the puppet 22nd Division, stationed in Junmenling by Jiang Rizao, was surrounded and defeated by the Yu and Zheng Regiments of our army, who seized a water-cooled machine gun and countless rifles and ammunition.

<h3>Liu Zhenhua Returns to Anhui: Inspects Dongliu and Executes a Vexatious Litigator by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Temporary Winter Defense Measures Specified; Anqing Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, after assuming the position of Chairman of Anhui, left for Huangchuan within a few days to oversee the suppression of bandits. Now that the bandit suppression campaign has concluded, he traveled from Huangchuan to Hankou and then to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang and personally report on everything. He returned to Anhui from Jiangxi on the 24th of last month. In recent days, he has personally inspected various departments of the provincial capital. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, at 9:00 AM, he crossed the river by ferry to Baduhu, under the jurisdiction of Dongliu County, on the opposite bank of Anqing, to inspect Guangfengwei and the private Daguang Middle School before returning to the province in the afternoon. It is reported that Liu believes Xu Xiongqiu, a vexatious litigator from Tongcheng County, has no permanent occupation and relies solely on his writing skills to make a living. He has been repeatedly accused and imprisoned, accumulating numerous offenses. This year, a small number of Hakka residents of Baduhu in the county, instigated by Xu, resisted paying the land tax specifically designated for the security team, resulting in arrears for six or seven months. The provincial government has repeatedly received complaints from the people of the county. During Liu's inspection, Xu happened to be in custody, so Liu questioned him and, upon confirming the facts, immediately ordered his execution by firing squad to punish the troublemaker. Furthermore, Liu believes that the situation in various counties, with bandits lurking and conditions complicated, is critical. Fearing that villains might exploit the situation and cause disturbances, he has specified three temporary preventative measures: (1) All gatherings, associations, strikes, and market closures deemed detrimental to public order, as well as news, magazines, books, and various printed materials, will be strictly prohibited. (2) Postal mail and telegrams with suspicious content may be inspected. (3) Local militia, farmers' associations, and any public organizations that engage in illegal activities that disrupt public order will be disarmed, disbanded, and reported for the record. Yesterday, these orders were telegraphed to the Security Commanders of various districts in southern Anhui, the County Magistrates of various counties, and the Chiefs of Public Security Bureaus, instructing them to comply accordingly.

<h3>Economic Commission Dispatches Personnel to Survey Henan's River Works; Over Four Million Required for Five Major River Works</h3>
<p>Engineering Office to be Jointly Organized by Three Agencies, Kaifeng Correspondence: The Henan Provincial Department of Construction previously drafted plans for five major river works projects, including the dredging and channeling of the Huiji River, the diversion of the Luo River, and the harnessing of the Sha River, Wei River, and Bai River. The provincial government requested assistance from the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance, recognizing that these projects could both assist agriculture and navigation and transform the soil, eliminate salinity, and increase salt tax revenues by approximately two million yuan per year, requested the National Economic Commission to dispatch Fu Pucheng, an engineer from the Water Conservancy Department, to Kaifeng to conduct an on-site survey and discuss implementation methods with local authorities. Fu departed this morning to inspect the downstream works of the Huiji River. It is reported that the five major river works projects are estimated to require over 4.8 million yuan, of which 3 million yuan is for river excavation, labor recruitment, and canal land prices, to be borne by the province, and 1.8 million yuan is for bridges and culverts on various rivers, to be allocated by the Ministry of Finance from Henan's salt tax revenues. In recent days, he has completed an inspection of the upstream works of the Huiji River with Director Zhang of the Department of Construction and Director Guo of the Opium Suppression Bureau. According to reports, the Huiji River has three sources of water: (1) the Liuyuankou opening, (2) the Heigangkou opening, both using inverted siphons to draw water from the Yellow River. The Department of Construction is building a control sluice gate at the Second Embankment, ensuring that diverting the Yellow River into the Huiji River will be safe. (3) Water from the Yangqiao area of Zhongmu County is diverted into the Jialu River and then into the Huiji River, which flows into the city of Bian, providing drainage for the city's accumulated water, reducing salinity, and benefiting sanitation. When the various river dredging projects are implemented in the future, an engineering office will be jointly organized by the Economic Commission, the Opium Suppression Bureau, and the Department of Construction to handle the work. However, I personally believe that the Huiji and Jialu River projects should be undertaken first, followed by the dredging of other rivers. The following is an outline of the river works project plan as indicated by Fu, for the reference of those concerned about water conservancy in Henan Province.</p>
<p>The Huiji River originates in Kaifeng, passes through Chenliu, Qi County, Sui County, Zhecheng, and enters the Huai River in Anhui, with a total length of over 300 li. Due to years of silting, agriculture and navigation have been affected. The Department, recognizing the urgency of dredging the river, is now supervising the excavation work. All water sources are planned to initially draw water from the Yellow River embankment at Liuyuankou, north of Kaifeng, through an inverted siphon, and then divert the Yellow River water through the newly excavated Huanghui River canal to the south gate of the city and into the Huiji River. However, the siphon's water flow is very weak, insufficient to irrigate along the river. To increase the water volume, it is planned to divert the Luo River into the Jialu River. If the plan is successful, a new canal will be dug in Zhongmu, extending eastward to the border of Kaifeng, so that the Jialu and Huiji Rivers are connected, increasing the water source. Although the Huiji River dredging project has been completed more than 70%, the slopes of the banks and riverbed still need to be smoothed by hired labor, to make it perfect, because of the conscripted labor. The old bridges are not applicable as the river channel has been deepened and widened, and the bridge holes should be enlarged to avoid blocking the water flow. New bridges should also be added to facilitate traffic, and culverts should be built to facilitate drainage. It is also planned to open a canal in the northwest corner of Kaifeng, to divert the Huanghui River water into the city, washing the accumulated water in the urban area, reducing salinity, and improving sanitation. The above-mentioned uncompleted works of waterway management and culverts urgently require 192,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The Jialu River source is often insufficient in dry weather, and floods are a hazard in flood season. Therefore, it is planned to imitate the Song Dynasty's method of diverting the Luo River to benefit the Bian River, in order to facilitate the canal transport, drawing water from the Luo River at Gong County, passing through Leishui, Xingyang, Zhengzhou, and Zhongmu, dividing into two branches to the southeast. The southern branch enters the Huai River through the Sha River, and the eastern branch enters the Huai River through the Huiji River via the Liu River. A barrage and operating gate are built at the entrance, as well as a sand discharge outlet and wastewater ditch. A diversion channel is set up at the crossing of the railway, and a diversion gate and ship lock are set up in Zhongmu, which is controlled according to the ebb and flow of the upper and lower reaches. And use telephone reporting at the upstream and various gates, pre-opening and closing, in order to facilitate operation.</p>
<p>Since the Sha River is the tail end of the Jialu River, if the plan to divert the Luo River into the Jialu River is realized in the future, then it is necessary to dredge the Sha River. The section from Yancheng, Zhoukou to Huaidianji, about 200 li long, urgently needs to be dredged and bridges should be added to facilitate traffic.</p>
<p>The Wei River originates in Xiuwu County, flows through Huojia, Xinxiang, Ji County, Xun County, Neihuang, and enters Hebei Province, with a length of approximately 300 li in Henan Province. The upper reaches are silted up for about 160 li. The water source is insufficient, resulting in no passage for navigation. There was a previous proposal to divert the Dong River into the Wei River, but because the Yellow River's water level is higher than the Wei River's water level in Xinxiang, reaching seven zhang and five chi, this project should be carefully considered. For the plan today, the river channel should be dredged, and sluice gates should be set up to store water, to increase the water volume, benefiting agriculture and navigation. The Bai River originates in the Shuanghongling of Song County, north of Yuanyuan Nanzhao, and reaches the border of Hubei Province through Nanzhao, Nanyang, and Xinye. During the Han Dynasty, the virtuous official Zhao Xinchen opened a canal to irrigate fields, using this water. Within Henan Province, there are about 300 li. In Nanzhao and Nanyang, the river channel is gradually silted up, and it should be urgently dredged. Also, in the area of Ji Chang of Weiwanbao in Nanzhao County, canals can be diverted to irrigate fields, benefiting the livelihood of the people. (6th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Establishes Electric Signals</h3>
<p>- A New Initiative in Railway Engineering and Works - Beijing News: The Tianjin-Pukou Railway connects Shanghai and Zhejiang in the south, controls Beijing and Tianjin in the north, intersects with the Longhai Railway, and connects with the Jiaoji Railway, spanning over 2,000 li. It is truly the transportation center of the country, of utmost importance to China's political, military, economic, and cultural development. However, due to frequent military conflicts in recent years, it has suffered repeated damage. Fortunately, the railway authorities have not been discouraged and are determined to reorganize. For example, the development of business has led to recent monthly revenues of over 2 million yuan, a record unseen in recent years. In terms of engineering, the most notable projects include the replacement of the Hanzhuang Bridge, the planning after the takeover of the ferry, and the commencement of the pier construction. Furthermore, there is the establishment of electric signals, with engineer Zhang Gonghuan of the Works Department in charge. American signals are all electric, so there is no need for mechanical or manual labor. Only the current needs to pass, and trains can travel safely. The simpler the fact, the greater the convenience. Among the railways in our country that have installed electric signals, there is a section outside Beining Pass (the Huanggutun area), but it has fallen into the hands of the Japanese puppets. Now, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is the first to start this end, which is a positive news for the railway industry. (7th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Government Borrows Housing Rent Again; Borrowing Amount is One and a Half Months</h3>
<p>Nominally for Maintaining Silver Notes, Guangzhou Correspondence: The trend of paper currency depreciation in Guangdong Province has gradually subsided in recent days. The one-yuan and five-yuan notes of the Provincial Bank have risen back to 95% of their face value by the beginning of this month, with little difference from the usual exchange rate. For transactions over one yuan, paper currency is generally accepted at full face value. As for the ten-yuan notes that have been suspended from exchange, the market price is about 65% of the face value, and the date of resumption of exchange is not far off. In order to maintain this trend, the Department of Finance announced yesterday that those who have previously paid owed salaries from various customs offices and business associations in the province will be allowed to pay 80% in ten-yuan notes if they have been out of office for four years, 70% if they have been out of office for three years, 40% if they have been out of office for two years, and 30% if they have been out of office for half a year. However, this must be cleared within the year and is invalid if the deadline is exceeded. In order to absorb the quantity of ten-yuan notes, reduce the amount in circulation in the market, and promote the restoration of full use of the ten-yuan notes, starting today (the 4th), the method of borrowing shop rents and sealing up paper currency will be imitated, and the Department of Finance will announce the implementation. The announcement stated: (It has been observed that due to the recent events in Fujian and rumors circulating, the provincial bank's paper currency has been affected, leading to a run and causing financial instability. Although the provincial bank's credit is solid and there is originally nothing to worry about, the government's issuance and the public's use, in addition to the 50% cash reserve, the remaining 50% guarantee reserve, one being real estate and the other being tax revenue, cannot be quickly paid off. The Guangdong Provincial Government has adopted the approach that if the amount in circulation in the current market is not reduced, it will not be enough to make up for the deficit. It was found that in the 19th year of the Republic, the reorganization plan was completed, and the landlords of shops and docks in Guangzhou City were borrowed for one month, limited to eight months, and went to the Bank of China with the certificate to collect the cash. The method was simple and the funds were raised easily. However, this kind of borrowing will easily arouse suspicion among businessmen and the public if the funds are deposited with the government. Now, in order to show great trust, and referring to last year's method of sealing up a certain percentage of the capital amount, landlords of shops and docks in Guangzhou City will be sealed up for one and a half months to maintain finance and reduce the circulation of provincial currency. After drafting the method, it was submitted to the plan for approval, and now the Guangdong Provincial Government instructs that it should be filed and implemented from December 4th of this year. The Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau and the Guangdong Provincial Bank should send personnel to handle it together, and then make an announcement. Also attach the method: 1. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has decided to give interest to borrow one and a half months of rent for all houses, shops, and docks in the city in order to maintain finance and reduce the circulation of provincial currency. 2. The rent for the sealed area will be sealed and handled by the Department of Finance, the Provincial Bank, and the Public Security Bureau together in the Public Security Bureau. 3. The rent for the sealed area will be sealed and paid in provincial currency. The tenants will first seal it and then return it to the owner. The tenants should prepare one and a half months according to the monthly rent, pay it to the local bureau, verify the seal, stamp it, and return the original seal to the tenants for safekeeping. The tenants can use the borrowed rent to pay the rent to the owner. The sealing method for self-employed households is calculated according to the rent and donation case. 4. If the tenants move out during the borrowing period, they should hand over the certificate of removal together with the owner, and go to the competent bureau to prove it, and they will be allowed to unseal it, and the rent and police donations that should be paid will be paid separately. 5. The rent for the sealed area will be returned with a monthly interest of eight percent. The term is divided into two months and three months. When the term expires, the Provincial Bank will verify and unseal it and pay the interest. Before the term expires, it is not allowed to be dismantled without authorization. Those who violate it will be charged with the crime of owing rent for a month and a half to the private dismantler. 6. The rent for the sealed area will be collected within ten days from the date of announcement. Those who pay the seal within five days will be allowed to unseal it after two months, and those who pay the seal within ten days after five days will be allowed to unseal it after three months. Those who do not seal it within the time limit will be charged with the crime of owing rent and donations for a month and a half to the tenants. 7. The bureau will issue a note to the houses, shops, and docks that have been sealed for rent (this household has been borrowed for one and a half months), which will be posted in front of the door for identification) (December 4)</p>
<h3>Inspection Report on Gansu, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Ren An</h3>
<p>Conditions in Counties and Cities Near Honghu; Hankou Correspondence: The Hunan-Hubei border region, formerly the bandit-infested area of central Hubei, was most severe in Honghu, Jianli, Mianyang, and Qianjiang. This region is known for its rich agricultural produce, and the economic relationship between landlords and tenants is extremely unequal. Moreover, the land is only 50 meters above sea level, and lakes and rivers are everywhere. Reed bays and harbors have always been the lairs of bandits. Floods often lead to disturbances. The traces of the puppet Second Army Corps under He Long, who raised the banner of rebellion and entrenched himself, may not be as long as those of the Jiangxi bandits, but the distribution of land and the resistance to encirclement are still vivid in people's minds. The name "Old Soviet Area of Honghu" still makes people in the countryside gasp to this day. After inspecting Zhongxiang (Anluzhou), I intended to go down the Han River to these areas. However, due to the impact of banditry, the section from Xiangyang to Qianjiang has not been smoothly accessible. Therefore, I returned to Jingmen, took a car to Jingzhou and Shashi first, and then went to the above-mentioned areas. I received information provided by local authorities and witnessed the situation with my own eyes. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>Jingzhou is Jiangling. The city is vast and tall, with a moat outside connected to the river. The city is full of dilapidated tiles and walls, creating a desolate scene. Moreover, trenches for scattered soldiers are deeply dug in one corner of the city, winding for three or four miles. Entering the ancient city by car, even with just a glimpse, one feels as if one is on a battlefield beyond the Great Wall. It is said that the Manchu bannermen lived here during the Qing Dynasty, enjoying generous salaries and not engaging in production. Once the people's army attacked, their source of support collapsed, and they suffered from hunger and cold, tearing down and selling house materials. Eventually, they stole public property, causing the Guan Di Temple, the Temple of Literature, and the Prefectural Yamen, which were famous for their architecture, to be stolen and destroyed. In the past, a prosperous area has become a desolate place. The bannermen were solely parasitic, harming society and themselves. The world has always had a leisurely class that only knows how to consume and does not engage in production. This should serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Shashi is 15 li from Jingzhou, close to the river bank, and is one of the famous commercial ports along the river. In recent years, more than ten merchants who issued municipal tickets indiscriminately have successively gone bankrupt, and the circulating bills have become worthless. The economy has dried up, and all industries have declined as never before. However, in each village, when the spring grain and autumn cotton are harvested, the business of carrying goods and selling them is much better than in the city. This is probably because farmers work hard for a year, and although they can exchange goods for money at harvest time, the amount is not large. They can only buy from nearby peddlers. The poverty of the farmers and merchants is evident. The Municipal Construction Committee is currently engaged in the work of expanding roads and reducing houses in order to improve the city's appearance and facilitate transportation, which has aroused the resentment of some residents. There are many schools and a thriving newspaper industry. However, there is no establishment of libraries or public reading rooms, and social education seems to be neglected. Second Street along the river, named Datong Street, rises abruptly like a high city. Shops and houses are built on it, but the foundation is limited, making it feel cramped. This street is probably the old embankment, used to prevent floods. Later, due to the city's development, it was also used as a street. Outside the street, in the northwest corner of the river, there are many slums. Cement sewage pits and people are mixed together, which is detrimental to the city's appearance and sanitation and needs to be improved even more urgently. The southeastern corner is full of warehouses and storage yards of major companies, and the docks are also mostly built here. At that time, there happened to be two British and Japanese merchant ships berthed downstream. The British ship was crowded with passengers, and loading cargo (mostly cotton) had not yet finished all day, while the Japanese ship was rarely patronized. Seeing the cold atmosphere of the ship, one would not doubt that it was a warship. Later, in the customs office, I made a casual chat and learned that Japanese ships used to dominate the river transport in Shashi, but since the September 18th Incident, the citizens have been shocked by the tragedy of national subjugation, which is imminent, and have taken the initiative to resist goods and refuse Japanese ships to transport goods. The impact on their business can be imagined. They had no choice but to use methods such as (cheap ticket sales) and (free beds) to try to make ends meet. Japanese businessmen in Shashi prepared lamb and wine and invited the executive committee of our Chamber of Commerce and the leaders of the garrison troops to a banquet, hoping to strengthen the old friendship. Those who attended the banquet reluctantly agreed to facilitate communication with various merchants and restore the old friendship, but in practice, it has not been effective. Chinese shipping has gradually improved compared to the past because of this reason. Some passengers take the Japanese ships in the passenger traffic, but they are always shunned by the people of the city and feel extremely embarrassed. For example, the other day when a certain Japanese ship arrived here, one of the passengers suddenly had his box squeezed into the water by someone. He grabbed the man and argued with him, but suddenly a crowd of onlookers interceded, allowing the man to take the opportunity to escape. After the water police mediated, he still had to hire someone to retrieve his box. Running hurriedly with a red face into the cabin, several people looked back and hesitated. This is what happened in the last few days.</p>
<p>Qianjiang was formerly occupied by Red bandits. The city was demolished, leaving only an earthen enclosure. Soviet puppet governments at all levels had been established. The land in the southern part had been divided, with each man receiving 1.5 mu, each woman 1 mu, and each child 0.7 mu. Each mu yielded 23 shi in spring and autumn, but only poor farmers and hired laborers were eligible. Red soldiers were treated preferentially. The city was recovered by the National Army years ago, but scattered bandits have not yet been completely eliminated. The entire territory is a plain with no mountains, prone to floods. In drought years, rice paddies can yield two seasons. Tenant farmers account for about 75% of the county. Rented fields are called "ke tian," and paying rent is called "na ke." Dry land, in the middle, can grow wheat and cotton for two seasons, and its price is always equal to the best rice paddies. The price of grain is only 1.2 to 1.5 yuan per shi, and the price of cotton is only about 3 jiao per jin (the cotton harvest per mu used to be 90 jin, but now it is only 35 jin because farmers are living in insecurity and lack manpower). Taxes and land tax are collected up to 16 yuan per liang, and farmers' income and expenditure are extremely insufficient. Fortunately, the side business of fishing can be sold in Wuhan. The income per household ranges from 100 to 500 yuan per year, which is enough to make up for the lack of living in the main business. One silver yuan is worth 8,400 wen, and only copper coins worth 50 wen can be used. The remaining paper tickets are not accepted.</p>
<p>The current and past conditions of Honghu and Mianyang are roughly the same as Qianjiang, but the grain in Mianyang is cheaper, which has a greater impact on the rural economy. There is no need to say more. Honghu has many branching harbors and deep reeds, and it used to be He Long's base of operations in Hubei. There are islands in the lake, where important organs of the puppet organization were built. The Red Army Military Academy can accommodate 2,000 people, but the houses are not tall and are easily submerged by floods. They rebuilt new houses on top of them, building higher and higher to thirteen or fourteen layers. When the water recedes, the houses appear, which can accommodate 12,000 people. They also dug caves all over the mountain to avoid airplanes. When the National Army invaded, they were all burned. The traces are still clearly visible. The method of land division was based on population and labor force. Bandit soldiers and their families were selected to divide up good land. Their children who were 14 years old could get a full share of land. If there were no bandit soldiers in the village, they also had to leave public land for bandit soldiers according to how much land each person in the local area got. The number of shares was at least two people per village, and at most several people. They all chose land by the road and made stone or wooden signs with the words (Red Army Public Land) on them, and then the puppet government investigated (obligatory labor) and totaled how much, and allocated it to alternative farming. The intention was to encourage the Red Army to fight to the death and to encourage the bandit civilians to compete to become Red Army. It can be said that it was extremely severe. On the edge of Honghu Lake, those who depended on fishing were not divided into fields, but divided into fishing waters. During floods, farmers and fishermen had to bring their own food and take turns repairing the dikes. Bandit party members and puppet government staff also had to join the dike repair work all day on Saturdays. In addition to repairing the dikes, the victims also had to engage in the so-called autumn harvest struggle, seizing food, and also had to organize farm tool manufacturing plants, mutual aid teams, cultivation teams, and competition teams to work hard in production. Although the leaders cleverly said that these jobs were for the benefit of the farmers themselves, the farmers lived in insecurity and were always sighing with annoyance. The town of Fengkou on the edge of the lake occupies an important position. During the banditry, the central organs of the puppet Soviet government in the Hunan-Hubei border area were mostly located here. After the National Army recovered it, it was preparing to set up a new county seat named (Kecheng). Kecheng is the hao of Xu Yuanquan, the military commander of the Xu Army. Because the recovery of this area depended entirely on Xu's achievements, the county was named after his hao to commemorate him. The town used to have more than 2,000 households, but after repeated tragedies, there are only half of them left. It is expected that the new county seat will be established, and efforts will be made to build and stabilize people's livelihood, and it will gradually become prosperous. Also, the feelings between the urban residents and the villagers in this area are quite lacking. It is said that the city dwellers are mostly landlords, who secretly pursue the old rent debts from the villagers during the banditry. If they do not get their way, they threaten them with collaborating with bandits or banditry. Therefore, the villagers are reluctant to come to the city, fearing that it will easily cause all kinds of misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Improving Pottery in Jiangxi Province: Washing Away Humiliation and Recovering Rights and Interests</h3>
<p>Solving People's Livelihood and Developing Industry: Nanchang Correspondence. Xia Zongyu, Director of the Pottery Experiment Institute, broadcasted on the radio station at the Military Headquarters yesterday, discussing the points of reform that should be carried out in the pottery industry of Jiangxi Province: (1) Pottery is a famous national product of our country. To revitalize national products, we must improve the pottery industry. Because Europeans and Americans call porcelain workers using the sound of "Kaolin" and refer to porcelain products using the term they use for China, it is clear that the world has recognized that porcelain clay and porcelain products were invented by our country. However, among the places in our country that produce porcelain, Jingdezhen has always been the first. Recently, foreign countries have been relying on tariff policies, on the one hand, restricting the import of Chinese porcelain, and on the other hand, encouraging the import of new-style porcelain into our country. This has resulted in our country becoming a dumping ground for foreign ceramics. This situation not only has a significant impact on the economy but also brings great humiliation to the history of national products. This is one of the areas where the pottery industry in this province should be improved. (2) The pottery industry is a significant source of wealth for this province. If we want to preserve our source of wealth, we must improve the pottery industry. However, the national government also has a considerable income from the pottery industry, with larger amounts nearing one million and smaller amounts being four to five hundred thousand, which is a small supplement to the national economy. As for merchants trading porcelain, their profits are surprisingly large. Items costing one dollar are often sold for tens of dollars. This is especially true for overseas Chinese merchants trading porcelain, who often transform from small merchants into large merchants, and from small wealth into great wealth. From this perspective, the pottery industry in this province is truly a gift of nature, a treasure trove of endless wealth. Recently, due to adhering to old methods, costs have become too high, and foreign porcelain has taken the opportunity to import, and now there is almost a situation of the guest overwhelming the host. A great source of wealth is about to be lost, which is extremely dangerous. This is the second area where the pottery industry in this province should be improved. (3) The pottery industry is a good local occupation, so we must improve the pottery industry. Because now is a time of economic warfare, all the twists and turns in society are caused by the impact of the economy. If we want to avoid all the twists and turns, we can only promote the pottery industry according to local conditions. All the people who enter the pottery industry can solve their livelihood problems. However, in recent years, due to the unrest caused by bandits, the number of porcelain factories that have closed down has increased, and the number of unemployed porcelain workers has grown. The weak starve and await death, and the strong take risks. This hidden worry is a problem. This is the third area where the pottery industry should be improved. (4) The pottery industry is needed for industrial research. If we want to develop industry, we must first start by improving the pottery industry. Because the pottery industry is mainly based on porcelain manufacturing, and the nature of porcelain is hard, dense, non-conductive, resistant to acids and alkalis, and resistant to hot and cold, it is suitable for various needs in industry. Our country has always paid little attention to the manufacture of such porcelain. When there is a need, we do not hesitate to spend a lot of money to purchase it from foreign countries. The loss of rights and interests is certainly considerable, and the necessary materials for industry rely on others. There is no guarantee for future progress, which is truly regrettable. This is the fourth area where the pottery industry should be improved, etc.</p>
<h3>Jiao Wang: Collapse of Farmland Near Mines</h3>
<p>Thousands of Farmers are Victims: Xuzhou Correspondence. The Jiawang Coal Mine in northern Xuzhou was established in the late Qing Dynasty. The coal produced is very powerful, second only to the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mine. After the Jinpu Railway opened to traffic, Jiawang was more than ten miles east of Liuquan. The company then built the Jialiu Railway to facilitate transportation. As a result, sales expanded. Currently, the general manager is Gu Zongqi, and the mine manager is Jiang Shanshou. In recent years, they have been actively managing and expanding the mining area. This spring, they purchased dozens of hectares of land in Daquan and Quanwangtou, which belong to the ninth district of Teng County, to engage in coal mining. This has resulted in the mining area being hollowed out in the exploited areas and being mined in all directions, causing danger to the farmland above. In June of this year, the farmland in that area showed signs of collapse. The local people sent representatives to request the person in charge of the mining area to stop mining in all directions, but the mining company did not adopt this request. Unexpectedly, about ten days ago, about ten hectares of good farmland collapsed, and more than five thousand graves collapsed, with white bones exposed and coffins piled up. No fewer than several families of farmers were victimized by the collapsed farmland. The collapsed area is about ten miles long and four or five miles wide, all of which are ground collapses. Nearby villages are all in danger. Now the people have gathered and are preparing to use force to fight. It was also found that in July of this year, the mining company excavated new wells, causing water to flow into the farmland, reaching a foot in level ground. After the people protested in unison and gathered weapons, a disturbance almost occurred. Later, the Teng County Government sent personnel to appease the situation, and the mining company agreed on a compensation plan for the losses, which was settled. Currently, the aforementioned compensation plan has not yet been implemented. Therefore, the people in that area have appointed representatives such as Sun Rongan to file a lawsuit with the High Court. The area where the eleventh district of Yishan borders Teng County also has fields that have been affected. It is planned to assist the people in Teng County in their efforts. As for the collapse of good farmland, it was caused by the mining area digging beyond the scope. The workers in the mine are mostly employed foreign refugees. When they go down the well, they have already put their lives at risk. It is predicted that many miners will be buried in the cave when the ground collapses, but there is no way to find out. The company has about two thousand workers and can produce six to seven hundred tons of coal every day (8th).</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Anti-Japanese Association Accused of Malpractice</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has recently been accused by party members Lu Yiran and others to the central and provincial authorities, pointing to collusion with unscrupulous merchants, accepting bribes, and organizing a transportation company to transport enemy goods. The unscrupulous merchants provide funds, and Sheng Xixi and Yao Hongzhi of the Anti-Japanese Association come forward to run the Wuxian News as a tool for cover-up and attack. On the one hand, they have been stealing and selling more than a thousand pieces of enemy goods seized and stored in the Anti-Japanese Association in succession. Other members of the Anti-Japanese Association, such as Chen Weizhi, are also in collusion with them. They request a thorough investigation and punishment according to the law. The central authorities once sent personnel to Suzhou to secretly investigate and found that the Wuxian Anti-Japanese Association did indeed have illegal malpractices and that some people had made a fortune through the anti-Japanese movement. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters was ordered to investigate thoroughly. On the other hand, Yao Hongru submitted a report to the Wuxian Party Consolidation Committee in September, pointing out that Lu Yiran's accusations were groundless, fabricated, and had other purposes, and also requested a thorough investigation of the truth.</p>

Zhou Quanchang, who answered the phone, authorized the release of the ship without authorization, which was learned by Director Shen, who was furious. He immediately ordered Zhou Quanchang to be arrested and imprisoned, and at the same time strictly investigated the contraband. After the news spread, the soil warehouses in Suzhou City, including Yuji, Guo Baofeng, Yu Ji, Qia Ji, Yi Ji, Hongtai, and Ma Shaozheng, have all removed their signs and temporarily suspended business.</p>

The case of Lu Ping, the backbone of Chongming Review in this county, who was suddenly arrested by Captain Gong of the 17th Water Police Team on the evening of the 5th and sent to the Public Security Bureau, has been reported in the previous newspaper. According to the investigation, Captain Gong and County Magistrate Shen, because I have always held the attitude of eradicating drugs regardless of whether it is for public or private purposes, were involved in this incident for no reason. Therefore, Lu Ping was assigned to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the County Government. Today (8th), the local impartial gentleman Gong Jianqiu came forward with public opinion, invited all the journalists in the county and Captain Gong, etc., to explain to each other. During the meeting, Gong also stated that he had nothing to do with the drug institutions in Xixiang.

Therefore, Lu Ping felt that the Chongming Review had involved County Magistrate Shen and Captain Gong without distinguishing between right and wrong and expressed his apology. Captain Gong also expressed his misunderstanding and would prepare a statement to the County Government requesting the revocation of the case. During the meeting, everyone traced back the achievements of Captain Gong and County Magistrate Shen in Chongming and highly praised them. Captain Gong and others also praised the Chongming Review for upholding public opinion. They talked until about 10 o'clock before the host and guests parted in joy.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Chiang Orders Arrest of Chen Leigong</h3>

Shi's wife, Hu, secretly set a trap and arrested Chen on the spot and handed him over to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation, etc., as reported in this newspaper. It is now known that before Chen Leigong was arrested, Gao and others in the county had accused him to the Second District Commissioner's Office of being an unemployed vagrant specializing in extortion and requested his arrest. After receiving the report, Commissioner Cai secretly ordered the County Government last month to arrest him and send him to the Reformatory to await reformation. The County Government received the order and was processing it when Chen had already been arrested. When the Public Security Bureau transferred Chen Leigong to the County Court, the twenty yuan of stolen money and bills that were seized on the spot (all the banknotes had Shi's signature) had suddenly been replaced with fifteen yuan by the Public Security Bureau. The County Court immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau for inquiries. Director Li replied that the accounting department needed yuan banknotes, so fifteen yuan had been exchanged for yuan banknotes. However, there was still one five-yuan note, which was the original item and still had Shi's signature, etc. The Prosecutor's Office then accepted the case, and after Shen, the prosecutor, interrogated him, he ordered Chen Leigong to be detained until yesterday (9th) at about 10:00 am. Shen, the prosecutor, led the police to search Chen's residence on Tongyun Road and seized many letters and drafts, which were taken to the court. At the same time, the County Government of this county suddenly received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, ordering an investigation into whether Chen Leigong was an illegal person and to arrest him immediately.</p>

Another strong man was holding a pole and hitting the old man's head. Seeing this, Lu also shouted for help and shouted at the strong man, "Why are you attacking in the night?" Neighbors were awakened by the sound. At that time, the attacker picked up the straw sandals and straw ropes and left, saying that the old man owed him money. Lu and others saw that the old man's face was covered in blood, so they all chased after the strong man.

<h3>Local News: Sun Ke Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Says Peace in Fujian is Impossible</h3>
<p>Hoping that the Southwest Committees will Enter Beijing Immediately. Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing at 7:20 am yesterday. After getting off at Zhenru Station, he went straight to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest. At 10:30 am, he met with a group of reporters and made a statement, which is recorded below.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Plenary Session Will Be Held as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Sun said first that Mr. Zhang Puquan and others had come south this time specifically to urge the central committee members from various places to enter Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session and exchange opinions. Mr. Zhang did not bring any specific plan with him this time. The Fourth Plenary Session will be held in Beijing as scheduled. In case the central committee members from Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places cannot arrive in time due to the longer journey, it is planned to hold the opening ceremony on the 20th and then delay the official meeting for a day or two.</p>
<h3>Peace in Fujian is Impossible</h3>
<p>Sun continued, saying that Chen Mingshu and his associates are all warlords. They regard the Nineteenth Route Army as their private property and create chaos in Fujian. Except for a few high-ranking military officers who have ambitions and plot wrongdoing, the rest of the middle and lower-ranking military officers and soldiers are unwilling to resist the Central Government. Therefore, when the time is right, they will eventually return to the Central Government. However, it is now impossible to seek a peaceful solution. If they are not given a major blow, they will not be able to realize their mistake. I telegraphed Guangdong to suppress Fujian, which was a matter of days ago. This time, Mr. Zhang Puquan and others went to discuss the Fujian issue. As for the Fujian people asking not to send planes to bomb Fujian, the Central Government will not take this step unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>If There are Opinions, They Can Be Presented</h3>
<p>This time, the Fourth Plenary Session will be held in Beijing. All members of the Central Committee should attend. Otherwise, how can it be called a plenary session? If the central committee members from Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places have opinions, they can be presented and discussed at length. It is impossible to refuse to enter Beijing and attend the meeting simply because there are opinions, which would prevent their opinions from being discussed. If they wait until after the meeting to express their opinions separately, it will only increase disputes and not help the party and the country. Sun said that the Central Government had originally planned to convene the National Assembly in July of this year, but it was postponed to November of this year due to opposition from Guangdong. Finally, it was opposed again, so the responsibility for convening or not convening the National Assembly in advance should be borne by Guangdong.</p>
<h3>The Plenary Session Will Discuss How to Unite</h3>
<p>Sun said that the Central Government should prevent the so-called "Third Government" and the rumors in North China from becoming a reality. Can China still have hope if it cannot be united? How to unite will be discussed at this plenary session, which is to promote unity and consolidate unification by democratic means. I have no proposals for this Fourth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>President Wang and Others Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Zeng Zhongming left Beijing by overnight express train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Speaks</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu spoke responsibly to reporters yesterday, saying that there was a rumor in the city yesterday that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had resigned. After investigation, this was a rumor created by reactionaries and speculators. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been entrusted with heavy responsibilities by the party and the country. The country is facing difficulties, and he is supervising the suppression of the Red bandits, seeking the fundamental stability of China, and laying the foundation for construction. There is no such thing as resignation. The more reactionaries spread rumors, the less people will believe them.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji and Others Leave Shanghai for the South Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Chen Zhaoying, representing the Central Government, went to Hong Kong and Guangdong in a private capacity to urge the Southwest Central Committee members to enter Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session and discuss the current situation. They left Shanghai on the President Pias of the Da Lai Company at 5:00 am yesterday morning and are expected to arrive in Hong Kong on the 11th of this month.</p>

<h3>Did Not Visit the Radio Station</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications originally scheduled to invite Mr. and Mrs. Marconi to visit the Zhenru International Radio Station.

After receiving the petitions, the Municipal Government combined them with the investigation report from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, studied them in detail, and formally submitted a written negotiation to the Japanese Consul-General Ishii Yataro (石射猪太郎) the other day, requesting immediate release to uphold sovereignty and foster friendly relations. However, as of yesterday, no reply has been received from the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<h3>American and Russian Ambassadors Shake Hands</h3>
<p>First Meeting After Resumption of Relations. According to Continental Press, after returning to Shanghai from Guangzhou, the American Ambassador Johnson originally planned to return to Beijing via Nanjing this Wednesday. However, due to a tooth cavity, he stayed in Shanghai for medical treatment, delaying his departure. The affected molar was extracted on Thursday. This reporter visited Ambassador Johnson yesterday (the 8th), and according to him, one reason for his stay in Shanghai was to wait for a meeting with the Russian Ambassador Bogomolov (鮑格莫洛夫), which was also the reason for the postponement of his visit to Nanjing. Ambassador Bogomolov returned to Shanghai on Thursday, and the two met at Ambassador Bogomolov's private residence on the same day. He stated that his visit to Ambassador Bogomolov was purely a diplomatic courtesy and there were no other matters. He also mentioned that he had met with the outgoing British Ambassador Lampson (藍浦森), who was on his way to Shanghai. In recent days, he has met with many important Chinese and foreign government officials, but there were no special issues. When asked about his departure date for Beijing, Ambassador Johnson replied that he needed to consult with dentist Smith (史密斯). It was heard that yesterday evening, Smith told Ambassador Johnson that his toothache had been cured and would not recur. Therefore, Ambassador Johnson planned to go to Beijing last night if there were available seats. He estimated that he would stay in Nanjing for about a week and then go to Beijing.</p>

The Ministry of Finance will also publish a public notice in the newspaper to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Lin Kanghou Discusses the Collection of Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to Various Malpractices. Due to the Treasury's financial difficulties, the Ministry of Finance has decided to collect inheritance tax. The specific measures are currently under consideration. A reporter from the Central News Agency, noting that the collection of inheritance tax is a new precedent in our country, specifically inquired about this matter with Lin Kanghou, former Vice Minister of Finance, yesterday. According to him, at a time when the national treasury is empty, collecting inheritance tax is indeed one of the ways to increase revenue. The collection of this type of tax should first pay attention to various malpractices. The collection of inheritance tax is different from the collection of other types of taxes and is most prone to malpractices and disputes. Taking cash alone as an example, at present, due to the unrest in various localities, a large amount of cash is concentrated in Shanghai, and most of it is deposited in foreign banks. Once inheritance tax is collected, this trend will inevitably worsen, and there may even be instances of using foreign names. How will such investigations be carried out? Furthermore, matters such as the deeds of properties in the concessions are even more difficult to investigate. Examples like this are numerous. Therefore, the collection of inheritance tax cannot only be levied in the interior but not in the concessions. This is something that should be noted before the inheritance tax is collected.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Commander Imamura to Go to Magong</h3>
<p>Responding to the Fujian Incident. A dispatch from the China United Press in this city and the Shanghai Japanese Daily states that Lieutenant General Imamura Nobujiro (今村信次郎), commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to the Magong naval port on Penghu Island on the 11th of this month with three destroyers of the 27th Destroyer Division. Sakai, the newly appointed Japanese naval lieutenant stationed in Xiamen, will also accompany him. They will discuss countermeasures to the Fujian Incident with the naval authorities there. The Japanese Navy will adopt an active policy and plans to return to Shanghai on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Drivers' Association Demands Action: Foreign Crew Members on Chinese Ships Fail to Undergo Examination After Deadline</h3>
<p>Those who fail to comply should be replaced. In order to reorganize navigation affairs, the Ministry of Communications promulgated examination regulations and held crew examinations. All captains, first officers, second officers, chief engineers, first assistant engineers, and second assistant engineers of Chinese merchant ships, regardless of Chinese or foreign nationality, were required to undergo examination by the Examination Committee of the Ministry of Communications within five months, from June 1st to the end of November of this year. Those who failed to undergo examination after the deadline would not be allowed to serve on Chinese ships. Now that the first deadline has passed and foreign crew members have not complied, they should all be replaced. The local Merchant Ship Drivers' Association has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Communications requesting the recovery of navigation rights and the employment of Chinese nationals. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Foreign Crew Members Should Undergo Examination</h3>
<p>Article 16 of the Examination Regulations for Crew Members promulgated by the Ministry of Communications states that foreigners currently serving as officers of all ranks on Chinese ships, regardless of whether they hold merchant ship officer certificates, must, within six months from the date of implementation of these regulations, i.e., June 1st, undergo examination and obtain certificates in accordance with Article 1 of these regulations and the Provisional Regulations for Crew Certificates before they are allowed to serve. Now that the six-month deadline has passed, none of the foreign crew members have complied with the regulations and undergone examination.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Foreign Crew Members Disregard Ministry Orders</h3>
<p>According to a detailed investigation by the Drivers' Association, there are more than one hundred foreign crew members currently employed by various Chinese merchant shipping companies as captains, first officers, second officers, and chief engineers on ships operating on the Yangtze River and in the northern and southern seas. The companies employing the most such foreign crew members are Zhengji, Zhaoxing, Haichang, Datong, and Yuda, while other shipping companies also employ a significant number. When the Ministry of Communications held crew examinations this year, none of these over one hundred foreign crew members went to Nanjing to undergo examination, showing their disregard for the Ministry's orders.</p>
<h3>Why Are Disqualified Crew Members Still Serving?</h3>
<p>As of December 1st, the six-month deadline has passed, and these foreign crew members should no longer be allowed to serve on Chinese merchant ships according to the regulations. By failing to undergo examination, they have lost their qualifications as crew members. Furthermore, without the issuance of new certificates, they can no longer hold these positions. However, the Ministry of Communications has not yet issued an order to Shanghai to dismiss these foreign crew members, so the foreign crew members are still serving on various merchant ships as usual. Observers say that the regulations will be rendered meaningless.</p>
<h3>Drivers' Association Submits Petition to the Ministry for Instructions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Ship Drivers' Association has received inquiries from its members who have passed the examination regarding this matter. All agree that this matter is of great importance to the dignity of the Ministry's orders and the recovery of navigation rights. The Association has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Communications based on the regulations, requesting clear instructions on whether the foreign crew members who failed to undergo examination after the deadline should be replaced with qualified Chinese drivers in accordance with the regulations. The petition has already been submitted. According to the Ministry's regulations, if any crew members are serving on ships without undergoing examination, the customs office may prohibit them from clearing customs.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Breach at Changyuan: Closure Not Expected Until Next Spring. Representatives from Hebei Disaster Area Petition the Industrial and Relief Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiangxian and others to inspect Changyuan within the week. Tian Jianai and Wang Fengduo, representatives from the Yellow River disaster area in Hebei Province, traveled south to Nanjing to petition and came to Shanghai to contact various charitable organizations for disaster relief. Yesterday morning, Zhou Xiangxian, director of the Industrial and Relief Committee of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. Tian and Wang specifically went to the committee's office at No. 6 The Bund at 11:30 a.m. to petition for the speedy closure of the Changyuan breach. Director Zhou and Secretary Luo received them and explained the work situation, stating that the closure would not be possible until the spring. Zhou, Luo, and others also plan to inspect the project within the week. After understanding the project's progress, Tian and Wang departed. A report on the construction progress of the Industrial and Relief Committee is as follows:</p>
<h3>First and Third Districts to Be Completed Within the Month</h3>
<p>The breaches in the first district, within Henan Province, and the third district, within Dongming County, Hebei Province, are mostly dry breaches and have been blocked. The breaches at Xiaopangzhuang and other places in Lanfeng have also been closed. Some places are being heightened and reinforced with stone and willow revetments. The projects in these two districts are expected to be fully completed within this month. In addition, in the second district, within Changyuan County, all but the 30th breach at Fenglou can also be completed.</p>
<h3>Materials to Be Transported Before Freezing</h3>
<p>As for the large breach at Fenglou on the western end of Changyuan County, due to the large volume of water and rapid current, the project is the most significant. Materials are currently being transported. It is estimated that 8,000 cubic meters of stone are needed. 2,000 cubic meters have already been transported, and the remainder is being procured in Gongxian. Due to the lack of vessels for transportation, the committee has decided to purchase 200 vessels to transport the materials to Fenglou before freezing. The remaining 400,000 bricks have been transported 200,000 bricks already, and 100,000 are in transit. 300 tree trunks have already been transported, and 2,000 pieces of timber are being transported, all expected to arrive at the construction site before freezing.</p>
<h3>Willow Planting and Raft Sinking Proceed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The project is currently focused on dispersing the force of the breach water, building two diversion dams, and excavating two diversion channels. These are all underway. At the same time, a one-inch wire mesh is being laid horizontally in the waterway of the breach, with the old method of willow planting used on both ends to allow the willow branches to hang down in the water, allowing the river water to pass through while gradually reducing the current. At the same time, preparations are being made to use the raft sinking method, using rafts loaded with stones to sink. Because the former method uses fewer materials, but it is feared that the effects will be slower in an emergency, more materials are being prepared.</p>
<h3>Breach Closure Expected Next Spring</h3>
<p>Secretary Luo of the committee told a reporter from the New Voice Society yesterday that if the winter weather is mild and the Yellow River does not freeze, or the freezing period is short, the Fenglou breach closure project can be completed in February or March of next spring. If the freezing period is long, it will take until April or May. The flood will definitely occur in July or August, so there will definitely be no hindrance next year. In the past, it often took three or four years to close a Yellow River breach, and at least more than a year at the fastest. This time, it can be completed within a year, which is already very fortunate.</p>
<h3>Pudong Telephone to Be Officially Connected Today</h3>
<p>According to Da Kung She (大公社), after the establishment of the Pudong Telephone Branch at the end of last month, the open lines along various roads, as well as the underwater trunk and branch cables crossing the river at Hankou Road Bund, Gaochangmiao Riverside, and Bailianjing Port, had been laid in succession. More than fifty new machines for registered users were completely installed before 4 p.m. yesterday. Engineer Yu Bingjian personally crossed the river to Pudong to inspect the project. It was decided that before 9 a.m. today, the branch's 800-line power supply machine would be used to individually test calls with the new users. Starting at 2 p.m., direct calls with the Chinese Concession would be officially connected. All operators from the three switchboards of the branch have been transferred from the main office to serve.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Plane Departed as Usual Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong plane of the China National Aviation Corporation was delayed by one day due to adverse weather in Guangdong last time, and only returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon. Therefore, the southbound flight that was originally scheduled for the day before yesterday morning was changed to yesterday morning. According to a person from the company, the plane left Shanghai at 6:18 a.m. yesterday morning and was not carrying passengers.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Association Issues Notice to Landlords to Drill Wells: Water Fee Committee Established Indefinitely</h3>
<p>Water outages will inevitably affect everyone. The Shanghai Real Estate Association's notice regarding the upcoming water outage, and related news, are reported below.</p>
<h3>Water Committee Stalled</h3>
<p>Ever since the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company started calculating water fees based on water meters, most landlords have been unwilling to pay because the water prices have suddenly increased several times over. Therefore, many have had their water supply cut off by the water company. Later, Feng and Bing took on the role of mediators and attempted to formulate trial methods with the Public Works Department and the water company. The Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Zhong En, also promised in person to organize a water fee committee if necessary to resolve this dispute. However, since the trial implementation, water prices have still increased too much. The Real Estate Association has repeatedly continued to urge Zhong En of the Upper Works Bureau to organize a water fee committee. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Concession has also supported this. However, the Public Works Department has not yet fulfilled this promise. The organization of this water fee committee, which could resolve the dispute, has almost become a pie in the sky.</p>
<h3>Encouraging the Drilling of Artesian Wells</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association, seeing that the organization of the Water Fee Committee is indefinite and that the pressure of water outages by the water company is imminent, specifically sent letters to its members and landlords yesterday, requesting the drilling of artesian wells in order to cut the Gordian knot. The letter reads: "Regarding the high-handed measures taken by the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company against our fellow company, Delley, this has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers in the city, and you are likely aware of it. Charging water fees as 5% of the rent has been practiced for decades, and then increased to 6%. In 1930, a surcharge of 25% was added. After inquiring with the manager of the water company, we were told that adding this surcharge would cover everything. Later, under protest, we paid it. Unexpectedly, our industry's great peace and excessive honesty has allowed the water company to take an inch and demand a foot. They are now charging water fees at 10% of the rent! Recently, with the approval of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, water fees can be charged at 15% of the rent, and the remainder is discounted by 20%! This is simply draining the landlords' rent or the citizens' income almost entirely, allowing an organization that is maintained by the citizens' taxes and that monopolizes the water supply necessary for people's lives to arbitrarily exploit citizens, cut off their lifeline, and seize profits. What could be more heartbreaking than this? If our industry can do its best to find its own solutions, and if we can all resolutely refuse to collect and pay water fees on behalf of the company, the water company will be helpless. However, just as the fox mourns the hare, we must pity those of our kind. Those who are suffering from the pain of paying huge water fees are indeed the citizens within the concession. Therefore, contributing a helping hand to help them reduce their burden is no different from helping ourselves. Therefore, the major landlords are now drilling artesian wells, both to use the quick-cutting method to resolve the water fee disputes and to reduce the living expenses of the citizens. Looking at the situation, if we do not quickly drill wells as a precaution, then the suffering of Delley Company and its tenants from water outages will pose the risk of indiscriminate disaster to all citizens in the concession. Therefore, we specifically inform you that for the sake of your own and the citizens' lives and property, you should quickly drill artesian wells. If the procedures are unclear, please feel free to inquire with this association, and we will assist you with all our strength. We wish you peace."</p>
<h3>Tenants Sue Landlord</h3>
<p>The tenants of Baifuli, Boli, and Baoshouli in the area between Pingliang Road, Fenzhou Road, and Yangzhou Road in Pudong have hired lawyer Wang Renlong to sue their landlord, Delley Company, because the landlord has refused to pay the water fees, causing all the tenants to suffer from a water outage. They demand compensation for losses, with the following conditions: (1) Losses from the 20-day water outage in April of this year. (2) Losses from the current water outage. (3) Losses from the tenants buying water from water boilers to drink (originally, the landlord purchased a large number of water tanks and hired people to carry water from the Huangpu River to supply the tenants, but the tenants found the river water too dirty to drink). Calculated at 20 cents per household, totaling more than 1,300 yuan. (4) Due to the lack of water, many tenants have moved out, resulting in a loss of 2,064 yuan for the second landlord. However, the landlord also has a strong reason for the steep increase in water fees after the water meter pricing, and the landlord has not sought compensation from the tenants. The matter is currently undergoing conciliation. If conciliation fails, they will inevitably go to court and argue their cases.</p>

<h3>Red Swastika Society to Welcome Chief Commander Chen Back to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Formerly Wounded by Japanese Aircraft Bombs, Almost Near Death. During this year's war in North China, the Shanghai General Office of the China Southeast Main Society of the Red Swastika Society sent a relief team to the battlefield for relief. The Chief Commander of the team, Mr. Chen Chaji, was injured by a bomb dropped by a Japanese aircraft while providing relief in Shixia. He was seriously injured and was treated in hospitals in Beiping and Jinan for several months. He has now recovered. The Society received a telegram from the Jinan Red Swastika Society yesterday stating that Chief Commander Chen will be traveling to Shanghai today via the newly opened Ping-Hu railway. Because Mr. Chen almost sacrificed his life to provide relief to the displaced, his spirit of great courage is especially admirable. The Society has convened all members and relief team members to welcome him at the North Station with a large military band. It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Governor's Wife of Hawaii Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Returning to Honolulu via Manila. The Governor of Hawaii and his wife, along with their three children, arrived in Qinhuangdao on the U.S. warship Chaumont on the 25th of last month and traveled to Tianjin and Beijing. They then arrived in Shanghai on the 6th and visited old friends, which kept them quite busy.

<h3>Reuters Commercial Editor Walter Passed Away</h3>
<p>Shanghai, Reuters, 9th. Reuters commercial news editor, Briton, Walter, died yesterday. Walter joined the service at age 15 and worked for 30 years. He participated in the European war, being wounded three times, and was awarded medals and stars.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Collects Land Survey Fees for Lu and Tian Fields</h3>
<p>Silver for mu. The Shanghai County Government recently received a report from the tax collector Cheng Shizhi, stating that he had been ordered to collect land survey fees for Lu and Tian fields. The fees are 2 jiao per mu for each of the 20th and 21st years for Tun fields, and 1 jiao per mu for each of the 20th and 21st years for Lu fields. Tun fields can be charged per mu, but the amounts for Lu fields are not equal. In previous years, tax collection has been weighted by silver. Now that we are collecting land survey fees, we can only use silver to request mu based on the 1926 assessment of mu taxes. It calculates to 9 fen, 5 li, 1 hao, 7 si, and 4 hu per mu, combining to 1 jiao per mu for Lu field land survey fee, and 1 yuan, 5 fen, and 1 li silver dollars per tael. In addition to ordering processing as proposed, the County Head Pan issued a notice to all Lu households to inform them that the number of silver taels for land is determined based on the silver in cases where there is no basis. Do not misunderstand.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Chief Captain Resigns: McKenna to Retire and Return Home</h3>
<p>Shen Jiyun's Concurrent Position Does Not Include Salary. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chief Captain, McKenna, has worked for the company for over 40 years, with a monthly salary of 956 yuan. He managed all the ships on a daily basis and his scheduling was systematic, which was trusted by successive general managers. Since the change to state-owned management, ship affairs have been managed by the Ship Department, and the position of Chief Captain has existed in name only. General Manager Liu Hongsheng, considering McKenna's age and to provide preferential treatment to meritorious personnel, asked him not to work hard at the office, and the bureau would pay him a monthly salary of 200 yuan and hire him as a consultant. McKenna expressed his unwillingness to this arrangement and immediately resigned. The bureau approved his resignation. However, foreign employees have contracts with retirement benefits, which increase by one month's salary for each year of service. McKenna has worked for more than 40 years, so according to the contract, more than 40 months of retirement salary should be paid, as well as vacation pay, return travel expenses, etc. Based on a monthly salary of 956 yuan, the total retirement salary and other items amounts to more than 40,000 yuan. This amount has been paid by the bureau's accounting department, and McKenna has claimed it to prepare to return home. The duties of the vacant Chief Captain position will be taken over by the Ship Department. It is proposed that Deputy Chief Captain Shen Jiyun act as the proxy, with concurrent duties and no additional salary. General Manager Liu has already submitted a report to the Ministry for instructions, and it will be implemented as soon as approval is received.</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships Delayed by Fog Enter Port</h3>
<p>The weather has been overcast for several days, and merchant ships along the coast and the Yangtze River have been delayed by heavy fog, with more than a dozen merchant ships anchoring at the Wusong estuary to avoid it. Many outbound ships were also delayed and stopped at Wusong. The weather cleared slightly yesterday morning, and the fog dispersed. The Huangpu, Jianguo, and Jiesheng ships, which were delayed, successively entered port before noon. The ships that were delayed at Wusong also telegraphed at noon that they had left Shanghai and set sail separately.</p>
<h3>The Yellow Disaster Relief Committee Continues to Produce 100,000 Cotton-Padded Garments</h3>
<p>Four companies, including Bao Da, are contracted for 150,000 yuan by the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Committee for disaster relief, including the continued production of 100,000 sets of children's and women's cotton-padded clothing. The Purchasing and Transportation Department has now signed contracts with four local companies, Bao Da, Hui Li, Da Chang, and the Shandong Houde Poor People's Factory, for a total of 150,000 yuan. The Houde Poor People's Factory will produce 10,000 sets, and the remaining 90,000 sets will be produced by Bao Da, Hui Li, and Da Chang. Production is now underway. However, a deposit of 44,000 yuan must be paid before the contract is signed. This amount has not yet been allocated by the Finance Section. The contract will be officially established upon receipt of the funds, and the first batch of cotton-padded clothing must be delivered within ten days.</p>
<h3>The Disaster Situation in Gansu is Severe</h3>
<p>Tian Jiongjin and Guo Weiping Anxiously Appeal to Chinese and Foreign Relief Organizations. Yesterday, Tian Jiongjin and Guo Weiping, specially appointed representatives of the Gansu Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, personally arrived at the meeting and stated that disasters have been frequent in the northwestern provinces. However, the situation in Gansu is particularly severe, mainly due to the difficulty of transportation and the lack of publicity. The Chinese people lack understanding of the true situation of the disaster, so it is difficult to provide sufficient assistance in terms of relief. Since the beginning of this year, the disaster situation in Gansu has become increasingly serious. Last year there was a severe drought and black frost, and this year there were floods and hailstorms. Almost all of the province's sixty-plus counties have been affected by the disaster. At this time of severe winter, the people in the disaster areas are crying out in hunger and cold, a tragic event that shocks heaven and earth. Therefore, they do not hesitate to travel long distances to personally seek relief, urgently requesting assistance from all sectors as soon as possible. Otherwise, Gansu will be completely transformed into a land of starvation. They also brought an official letter from the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee, which is copied below: (A petition requesting the allocation of huge funds to relieve the disaster victims in Gansu. Gansu has suffered from severe droughts in recent years, and millions of people have died from cold and starvation. This summer, there was sudden continuous rain, mountain floods erupted, and fields and crops were washed away by the water, and people and livestock were drowned in more than 40 counties. Although the province has tried its best to provide relief, due to limited resources, few have been saved. Recently, the weather has been extremely cold, and many disaster victims have died from starvation. The Provincial Disaster Relief Committee sent Jiongjin and others to Beijing and Shanghai to request urgent relief, asking for compassion to raise huge funds and send personnel to distribute them. Those who benefit will not only be the nine million disaster victims in Longshang, but all will be endlessly grateful.) According to reports, the province's transportation is blocked, resulting in little information about the true situation of the disaster, so people do not pay attention. Moreover, the province has always been known for its barren land and poor people. It is thought that charitable gentlemen will surely rise up to find ways to provide relief upon hearing this news.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting of the National Goods Maintenance Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association held the 49th joint meeting of the 22nd Executive and Supervisory Committees yesterday at the public toilet in Nine Acres. Chairman Wang Xingyi resolved the following cases: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's approval No. 17831, regarding the proposal to present measures to relieve the market and stabilize society, please review. Having read the presentation, it is not without merit. Instruct the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to consult with relevant groups for review and reply before ordering relocation. Also, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter of reply suggests that the municipal government implement measures to reduce rents, etc., which has been submitted to the Standing Committee for deliberation and a letter has been sent to the Real Estate Congress to discuss measures. Consolidated discussion of the case, resolved, will be handled as appropriate after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce relays the decision of each group. (2) The Shantou Municipal Silk and Satin Cloth Industry Association reported that Shanghai Guanghua, Da De, Tong Cheng, Guang Sheng Chang, Mei Yu, Da Dong, Wei Yi, Dan Qin, Yuan Feng Run and other factories' national goods cotton fabrics are transported to Shantou for import and are designated as foreign goods by the Chao-Shan Import Foreign Cloth Bureau, which levies taxes and destroys national goods. In addition to making reasonable representations, please collect powerful evidence from each factory and send it to Shantou for negotiation and effective correction. Resolved, send letters to the above-mentioned factories, and quickly send samples, trademarks, business name registration, and all documents to the association, assemble and send them to Shantou. On the one hand, send a special telegram to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance, requesting that the special tax bureau be ordered not to obstruct the levy of taxes in order to facilitate the sale of national goods. (3) The Tianjin Municipal Chamber of Commerce entrusted the investigation of whether the Di Yang brand cashmere yarn produced by the East Asia Woolen Textile Company is a national good. It is now clear that the company was indeed founded with Chinese capital, and the raw materials used are Australian cold sheep wool and domestic sheep wool. It has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government and issued a limited liability company registration certificate, and the Trademark Bureau has approved the registration of the Di Yang brand trademark. Filling out the investigation form, please review the case. Resolved, since it has been clearly determined that it is a national good, it should be forwarded to the China Bank's staff consumer cooperative for reference. (4) The Suzhou Wuxian Chamber of Commerce National Goods Villa Museum's letter of employment of Wang Jiean as a review committee member. Resolved, passed. (5) Shanghai Bulb Company submitted samples, trademarks, and registration certificates, requesting approval to join the association. Resolved, welcome to join the association.

<h3>In the Midst of Welcoming Marconi, the Wireless Radio Exhibition ｜Address: Hamilton House, Fuzhou Road｜ ｜The Opening Ceremony is Held by Mayor Wu｜</h3>
<p>In order to welcome Mr. Marconi to Shanghai and promote business, local wireless radio companies held a wireless radio exhibition at Hamilton House on Fuzhou Road at 11:00 yesterday morning. Mayor Wu held the opening ceremony. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency made a special trip to visit yesterday. The following is a record of what was seen:</p>
<h3>Opening Situation</h3>
<p>Around 10:50 AM, Mayor Wu arrived at the meeting and shook hands with the guests one by one. Then, the music was played and the meeting began. The ceremony was simple. First, Chairman Horse gave a speech, followed by Mayor Wu's speech, which was fluent and full of congratulations. After the speech, the chairman presented a bag of candy to express his gratitude. Finally, the music was played again and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu gave a speech using radio broadcasting, roughly saying: "President of the Broadcasting Association, ladies and gentlemen, esteemed guests, I am honored to be invited here today to participate in the opening ceremony. This is the second time I have participated in such a grand event. After carefully observing the exhibits this year, I am deeply impressed by the significant progress compared to last year. Wireless radio has an increasing contribution to China's progress. Its value to the development of transportation, military, navigation, and commerce is truly immeasurable. Mr. Marconi's invention of a new century, namely the effective and practical use of direct-shot radio waves, and the recent new invention of using extremely short waves, makes us sure that the future of electricity is incredibly wonderful. The development of radio stations and motion pictures is only a small part of the great inventors' contribution to society. Publications and writers predict that soon all the needs of the family, such as electric lights, electric stoves, electric ovens, and various household machinery power supply, will be broadcast using short waves, reaching the residences of residents throughout the city from the air. If this statement is true, then I will not hesitate to strongly retain Mr. Marconi in Shanghai to display his magic and solve the problem of people's livelihood in our country. What is displayed by various factories and businesses today is enough to show the power of electricity. I hope that not only Shanghai but the entire China will benefit. I hereby announce the opening of this exhibition."</p>
<h3>Venue Equipment</h3>
<p>The entrance ticket costs two dimes per person during the day and five dimes in the evening. With the ticket, you can draw a lottery ticket, which may have a hope of 500,000 yuan. At the entrance of the venue, there is a Western woman wearing a black dress. The woman's duty is to collect the entrance tickets of visitors. Her movements are very amiable and kind. Most of the exhibitors are foreign merchants, including more than 20 wireless radio companies such as Yersie, Victory Company, Feige, Steward, and Aiken. When the reporter arrived at the venue, there were already hundreds of visitors, most of whom were Westerners, and very few Chinese. On the left side of the entrance, Yersie Victory Company displayed various wireless radios. At that time, it seemed to be playing the song (Farewell Vienna), the sound of which was long and moving. In the middle of the venue, there is a Qiaoli Candy Shop, a coffee shop, etc., so that visitors can freely buy food. On the far left of the venue, there are several musicians playing various famous songs to entertain the guests.</p>
<h3>Special Issue Program</h3>
<p>The most noteworthy thing in the venue is the Western girls hawking commemorative special issues. Each booklet sells for two dimes. The content includes (A Review of Wireless Radio in China), (Exhibition Gossip), (Differences Between British and American Broadcasting), (Wireless Radio in 1950), (Identification of Wavelengths), (Strong Induction or Non-Polar Outer Difference), and (Several Types of Atmospheric Electricity Interference).</p>
<h3>The YWCA National Goods Exhibition Women's Fashion Show</h3>
<p>The preparations for the National Goods Exhibition of the Shanghai YWCA on Yuanmingyuan Road on December 14, 15, and 16 are gradually being completed. The women's era modernization and national goods fashion show during the entertainment are the most valuable. Ladies with artistic ideas, fashion beautification, broad social circles, and enthusiasm for serving social causes are specially invited to take on the role. The purpose is to guide Chinese women in the research methods of material selection, tailoring, and style, and to hope to arouse the interest of Western women in purchasing Chinese goods.

<h3>The Kidnapped Victim is Hidden in the Deep Mountains The Kidnappers Negotiate the Ransom in Shanghai In Fact, the Kidnapped Victim Died Long Ago Due to Depression</h3>
<p>The Police Learned the Details and Arrested Male and Female Bandits Wu Yougen, a resident of Hengkou Village, Beixiang, Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, was suddenly surrounded by armed bandits and forced into his home on the night of July 8 this year. Afterwards, Wu's family received a letter from the bandits asking for a ransom of 15,000 yuan. If the ransom could be paid, someone would be sent to Shanghai to negotiate. Wu's cousin, Wu Maozhao, came to Shanghai from his hometown and stayed in a hotel to search for the bandits' traces. He then met with the bandits' representatives Gao Xianzhang, Kong Qianquan, Cui Caishui, etc. in a room in a hotel on Guangdong Road. The bandits were all from Wu's hometown and knew that the kidnapped victim was hidden in the deep mountains of Ninghai. As a result of the conversation, Maozhao paid 5,000 yuan in cash first, and the bandits also reduced the ransom to 8,500 yuan, asking Maozhao to pay the full amount before agreeing to release him. At 5 pm the day before yesterday, the time for the second meeting between the two parties was scheduled, and the location was agreed near the New World Amusement Park on Nicheng Bridge. The matter was learned by Tang Jian, the Chinese Detective of the Xinzha Police Station. At that time, he led Deputy Detective Li Shizhong, Detective Ji Binkui, Xu Dezhong, Yang Fusheng, etc., and Western Detective White to rush to the place to wait. Soon, the two bandits Kong and Cui and Wu Maozhao arrived one after another and whispered in the open air. The detectives arrested the two bandits and took them back to the police station. After interrogation, it was learned that the Kong bandit lived at No. 182 Ruikang Lane, Jiaxing Road. They then went to his home to search and found Gao Xianzhang and his accomplice Ju Xianhe in the Kong residence and arrested them. However, since the area belonged to the Chinese Concession, the two bandits Gao and Ju were temporarily detained by the Public Security Bureau in charge. At the same time, according to Gao Ju's confession, they first went to Gao's residence at No. 55 Dengtuo Road and found 100 bullets and three bullet boxes. Then, at 11:30 pm, they successively arrested Hu Yueli, Wu Fusheng, Wang Zhenhou, Hu Jinfu, and Wu's wife Wu Daishi, etc. from a house at a certain number on Pike Road and found two pistols with live ammunition on Wu's bed, which were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court and interrogated by Judge Xue. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, stated the circumstances of the case. Later, the seven men and women of Kong and others were detained and a document was prepared to transfer the two bandits Gao and Ju to the Public Security Bureau so that the investigation could be concluded and prosecuted again. Then, Wu Maozhao explained the process of contacting Cui and Gao to redeem the ticket, saying that he had paid Kong and others 5,000 yuan and did not know anyone except Kong and the other three. Mao Zhikong Xiquan confessed that at that time, there were six accomplices who went to kidnap and the ransom of 5,000 yuan. I used 500 yuan, Cui used 250 yuan, Gao was the initiator, so he used more than 2,000 yuan. The kidnapped victim was originally hidden in the mountains, but later, because he was not redeemed for a long time, the kidnapped victim died of depression in the previous month, and the whereabouts of the body are unknown. The Cui bandit admitted to using 250 yuan, and the rest of the confessions were mostly evasive. The court then approved the detention for one week and waited for the two bandits Gao and Ju to be interrogated.</p>
<h3>The China Chemical Industry Society of South China Files a Re-Appeal Regarding the Butterfly Trademark</h3>
<p>Following the rejection of the Shanghai China Chemical Industry Society's Butterfly Lady Portrait trademark appeal by the Ministry of Industry, it has been reported that the society has engaged lawyer Zhang Shizhao to file a re-appeal with the Executive Yuan. The reasons are excerpted below: (Omitted above) (1) According to the intention of the Trademark Law, trademarks of two parties are considered similar only if their designs and colors are so mixed that they are difficult to distinguish. In this case, the two trademarks in question differ completely in terms of characters, one being a six-character phrase (Butterfly Lady Portrait) and the other being a three-character phrase (Invincible Brand). Their number of characters, calligraphy, and phonetics are entirely different. In terms of graphics, one is a simple portrait of a Butterfly Lady, and the other is a combination of racket, butterfly pattern, roses, violets, etc., and their designs, arrangements, and colors are even more different. If the two trademarks are placed together, they can be recognized at a glance, whether viewed up close or from afar, without any possibility of confusion. Moreover, the meaning of the two characters "trademark" is naturally understood as a symbol of the commodity. All trademarks with different symbols can be registered separately. Article 1, paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law clearly stipulates (The characters, graphics, symbols, or combinations thereof used in a trademark must be particularly distinctive and specify the colors to be applied). In other words, if the patterns are the same but only the colors are different, they can also be registered separately to comply with the so-called (specify the colors to be applied), meaning that the characters, graphics, symbols, and colors of both the (Butterfly Lady Portrait) trademark and the (Invincible Brand) trademark are vastly different, and in all fairness, there is absolutely no conflict between the two parties. (2) The reason given by the Ministry of Industry for rejecting the appeal of the Butterfly Lady Portrait trademark is roughly that (Invincible Brand) is the same as (Butterfly Brand). The only evidence is that when the opponent separately registered the three characters (Invincible Brand) between 1925 and 1926, it admitted that (Invincible) was a homophone of (Butterfly), and in 1918, when applying to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce for approval to pay taxes according to the precedent, the special brand name stated (Invincible Brand), intending to call it (Butterfly Brand), and in the tax office's replies to the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, and 1926, all stated the phrase (Invincible) i.e. (Butterfly). There is no stronger evidence than these official documents. However, the above points are inappropriate as reasons to oppose the (Butterfly Lady Portrait) trademark. The Trademark Law is by no means interpreted in this way. The effect of the trademark right is limited to the original pattern that has been registered and actually used. The so-called actual user should refer to the actual use of the trademark on the commodity, not the use of the trademark on the official documents of government offices, because commodity trading is conducted in the market, not in the official documents of government offices. In short, if the original trademark actually used is not sufficient to resist the trademark of the opponent, this point alone is clear, and what is the use of citing other evidence? This is the inherent interpretation of the trademark right in law, and the authorities should not force conformity. Furthermore, Article 14 of the Trademark Law stipulates (The registrant shall obtain the exclusive right to use the trademark from the date of registration). Then, the original trademark actually used by the Family Industry Society does not have the words (Butterfly). Since there are no such words, it is of course impossible to arbitrarily assert that (Invincible) is (Butterfly) based on the empty imagination of the two words (believe), because Article 1, paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law clearly stipulates that (characters) and (graphics) are two types that absolutely cannot be confused. Otherwise, not only would it violate the intention of the Trademark Law, but also the Family Industry's original pursuit of the (Butterfly Lady Portrait) trademark and application for registration of the (Butterfly Brand) combination trademark would not have been rejected by the Trademark Bureau. In short, regardless of the original trademark or the combination trademark, unless it has been clearly registered by the Trademark Bureau and actually used on the commodity, then no matter what evidence there is, it cannot be considered valid, and Article 19, paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law states (If there is no reason to stop it after registration, and it has not been used for one year or has been stopped for two years, the Trademark Bureau may revoke it on its own authority or upon the application of an interested party). If the trademark of the Family Industry Society has not been registered or used, then of course the two words (believe) cannot be used as a valid argument. Otherwise, the Trademark Law can be cancelled, and the Trademark Bureau is just a formality. Therefore, the reasons given by the Ministry of Industry are all distortions, arbitrary and biased, and how can people willingly accept this. (3) At the beginning of this case, the Family Industry Society, knowing that its (Invincible Brand) trademark was not sufficient to resist the (Butterfly Lady Portrait) trademark, urgently applied to the Trademark Bureau on June 21 last year to register the (Butterfly Chinese and Western Characters) trademark, following the (Butterfly Lady Portrait) trademark. It used four cases under Article 37, paragraph 3 of the Trademark Law, and one under paragraph 5. At that time, the Trademark Bureau rejected it on July 8 last year because the Butterfly Chinese and Western Characters used in paragraph 3 had already been registered by the Japanese merchant Ito Sakae. The reason was (According to the merchant's submission, the Butterfly Brand trademark is used on skin cream commodities of the skin cream category in Article 37, paragraph 3 of the implementing rules of the Trademark Law as a combination trademark of the already registered No. 3520 Invincible Brand trademark. After review by the examiner, it is considered that the combination trademark is the same as the Butterfly trademark Butterfly Chinese and Western Characters registered by Ito Butterfly Garden Ito Sakae in No. 7851 published in Trademark Gazette No. 25, and there is a risk of confusion in transactions. The requested exclusive trademark is difficult to approve and should be rejected according to the judgment). Based on the above judgment, it can be seen that the (Butterfly) trademark is by no means the property of the opponent, and its use in paragraph 5 of the (Butterfly Chinese and Western Characters trademark should also be rejected based on our company's Butterfly Lady Portrait) trademark, which was approved first, to be fair and impartial. However, the Trademark Bureau approved its application for use in paragraph 3 due to the registration by the Japanese, and approved its application for use in paragraph 5 because the Chinese were approved first, and this is very unfair in comparison. Moreover, the Ito Sakae case was recently handled by the Trademark Bureau itself, but due to the intention to protect, it turned a blind eye to it and suddenly begged for help from the old papers and documents of the Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce more than ten years ago, which were clearly abandoned by the party-state government, to slander it cleverly, which can be said to be extremely ridiculous. (4) If we talk about homophones, one is the six-character phrase (Butterfly Lady Portrait), and the other is the three-character phrase (Invincible Brand). The number of characters is different, and the phonetics are different. Moreover, after reading the Trademark Law, we have not seen any regulations on homophones. The trademark pays special attention to the symbol and takes the understanding of ordinary people as the principle. All trademarks that can be distinguished by eyesight and are particularly distinctive can be registered separately. This is the absolute interpretation of the Trademark Law. Because the goal of goods on the market is recognition, not blind acceptance. And the Trademark Law takes recognition as the principle and does not involve sound, because those who buy goods may be deaf or have them, but there are not many blind people. Furthermore, as evidence in the registration case, there is the Family Industry Society's (Invincible) and Ito Sakae's (Butterfly), and it is even more clear that homophones are arbitrary. The Trademark Bureau first rejected the case based on homophones, and then reviewed and retracted itself, saying that this case has nothing to do with homophones and is not worth discussing. The fox buries and digs up again, and the truth is clearly consulted.</p>

<p>At around 7:00 am yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the paper warehouse on the third floor of the Yuan Yi Printing Company at No. 232 Shandong Road.

At around 8:00 am, it was finally extinguished. As a result, the paper warehouse and staff dormitory on the third floor were all burned to the ground, and the second floor was also slightly damaged, causing huge losses. As for the cause of the fire, it is speculated that it may have been caused by the staff forgetting to throw the cigarette butts into the paper pile, but this has not been confirmed. Until the afternoon, the police and the fire department were still investigating. It is also heard that the company had fire insurance.</p>
<h3>Fugitives Arrested in Shanghai Yesterday for Robbery in Songjiang - Four Bandit Leaders Including Xia Dasan Mazi</h3>
<p>Along with the stolen goods, they were escorted to Songjiang for legal proceedings. The famous bandit leader Xia Dasan Mazi (i.e., Xia Xiaosan Mazi) from Yancheng colluded with bandits Xu Huaixiang, Xu Peixiang (i.e., Camel Son), Xu Peigao (i.e., Xu San) and Xia Dayuanzi, Xia Kaiqing, etc. from Funing. On the eighth day of the lunar month of this year, they went to Wu Youlan's house in Zhujiahang, Punan with weapons to search and rob the residents, and shot and injured the victim. They also robbed property in Caoging Wuku and other places. After the case occurred, Shen Jing, the director of the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau of Jiangsu Province, ordered all the detectives under his jurisdiction to be responsible for investigating and arresting the case in separate groups. Until the day before yesterday, Yang Shijie, the captain of the investigation team of the bureau, learned that the above-mentioned robbers Xia Dasan Mazi, etc. were all hiding near the silk factory behind Xiangyan Bridge in Hongkou, Shanghai. Captain Yang immediately reported to Director Shen, prepared a letter, and led detective Ye Bingsheng to Shanghai. He petitioned the city's Public Security Bureau to request that the investigation team leader Lu Ying send personnel to assist. After Lu verified the letter, he added resident investigators Shen Wenda, Xie Wanlin, Chou Shuxian, Zheng Bucai, etc., and several police officers from the third precinct of the fifth district. At four o'clock yesterday morning, they all disguised themselves and secretly went to a bungalow at No. 63, Pingmin First Residence, Quan Jia'an Road, behind Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei, and arrested the famous bandit leader Xia Dasan Xiaomazi (i.e., Xiaosan Mazi) from Yancheng, (28 years old), the bandit woman Xia Gu (19 years old) from Sheyang, and three suspects, Dou Yingren and Xu Rihuai (26 years old).

<h3>A Female Smoker Gives Birth to a Boy in Detention Center</h3>
<p>At around 4:00 am yesterday, someone from the Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei reported that someone was running a den and selling opium in Zhongxinglongli No. 28, Yongxing Road. The district immediately sent someone to the scene, and there were indeed several people inhaling and exhaling smoke. They were all arrested, a total of four people, along with opium lamps and opium pipes. However, one of the female smokers, according to her confession, was Yan Zhu, 44 years old, from Tongzhou. She was pregnant with a big belly. The other person, Yan Jingxian, 24 years old, was Zhu's son, and there were also Hong and Furong, who were all taken into custody. Fortunately, after the district improved the detention center, men and women were not mixed together. In addition to detaining the male criminals who were convicted of prohibited crimes in the district, the female criminals were detained in the Zhabei Judicial Sub-section of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau. Men and women who have not been convicted are temporarily detained in the wooden fence in front of the district's detention center, with men on the left and women on the right. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 pm, the female smoker Yan Zhu in the female fence suddenly shouted in pain. The guards were about to report to District Chief Lai to send Zhu to the obstetrics hospital, but suddenly there were several cries, and a male child fell to the ground. At this time, the district was preparing a document to send the smokers to the Zhabei Judicial Section for transfer to the Shanghai Local Court. District Chief Lai suddenly heard about this incident and immediately ordered the woman's son Yan Jingxian to call his father Yan Xuehan (45 years old) to hire a rickshaw to take Zhu back to avoid further investigation. It was found that this was the first time that a female criminal in the district had given birth to a child, so it was spread far and wide as a strange story.</p>

<h3>Falsely Accused of Theft, Anxious to Jump into the River</h3>
<p>Chen Xiling, a 15-year-old apprentice at the Guangdong Arts and Crafts Training Institute at No. 237 Yinge Road, Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road, is from Guangdong. He has a mother, Feng, and a brother, Ying (single name), both living at No. 112 Huapingfang, East Baoxing Road, Zhabei. Because his brother is unemployed and Chen cannot produce, the family's life is very difficult. His mother had no choice but to order Chen to stop his studies, and the family of three prepared to return to Guangdong. In advance, his mother borrowed 60 yuan from her nephew Chen Xikun, half to buy groceries, and the remaining half, 30 yuan, was hidden by her side to be used as travel expenses. They first vacated the house, and the family temporarily lived at a friend's, Lin Changgeng. It was decided to set off by boat on the 7th of this month. On the evening of the 5th, Chen recruited his fellow apprentice Murong Biao (double surname, single name, 16 years old, Guangdong) to help move his luggage onto the ship. Therefore, Murong stayed with Chen that night and did not return to the store. Unexpectedly, the next morning (the 6th), Chen's mother suddenly found that the 30 yuan in travel expenses hidden by her side had disappeared. She was shocked and cried. Lin Changgeng, a friend who heard about it, suspected that Murong had stolen the money, so he interrogated him and Chen severely, and threatened that if they did not tell the truth, they would be sent to the patrol room to be electrocuted to death. The two mistakenly thought it was true, and ran away privately in a hurry. They borrowed eight jiao from a friend and went to a small inn near the North Railway Station. They shared a bed, paying 1.20 yuan per night. During the day, they ate noodles to fill their hunger, and their situation was extremely embarrassing. After living there for three nights, they had very little left. Yesterday morning, they went to the Mass Education Center inside Xiaoximen to play. They didn't leave the center until about 2:00 pm. After buying things with a few copper coins, they walked north aimlessly. When they reached the Bund of Guangdong Road, they inadvertently took a small ferry of Longmao Dock to Lujiazui in Pudong. After wandering around, both of them felt that the money they had was used up, and that the fact that they were accused of stealing Chen's mother's travel expenses was a false accusation. Therefore, they decided to commit suicide by jumping into the river. After they had made up their minds, they went to Chuanjiang Wharf together and took the No. 6 ferry, pretending to cross the river. When the boat was rocking in the middle of the river, it was already 3:45. The two tied each other with handkerchiefs and linked one arm together. In the misty rain, they suddenly jumped into the river to seek death. The ferryman was anxious, but because the two bodies were sinking and floating, it was difficult to rescue them. Fortunately, Chen Lansheng, the boatman of No. 1401, rowed over and immediately tried to rescue the two. They were sent to the Customs Water Patrol Room. After being interrogated, it was found that their situation was pitiful. Bao Tan Hu Changqing was sent to investigate and summon their mother and brother to claim them.</p>
<h3>Three Robberies in Pudong - Three More Bandits Arrested - The Leader is a Dismissed Policeman Zhang Youqin</h3>
<p>At about 5:00 pm on the 5th of this month, there was a robbery case at Da Lai Cigarette Paper Store and Gongda Oil Store in Chenjiazhai, Yangjia Ferry, Pudong. At that time, Yang Zhongquan, the director of the First Section of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau of the city, learned of the incident and sent a police chief to lead police officers to rush to arrest the bandits.

<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the sky was cloudy and cold, and there were strong northeasterly winds off the Shandong coast. The Yangtze River basin and the coastal areas south of Ma'anshan had winds from the northwest to northeast, with occasional rain or drizzle. The weather south of Japan was bad, with rain, due to a low-pressure system passing through and moving northeastward. Also, within 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city was 58.5 degrees at its highest and 53.1 degrees at its lowest. On the same day last year, the highest was 53.4 degrees and the lowest was 23.0 degrees.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>— Thin Wren</p>
<p>Everything in the universe exists within three periods: past, present, and future. It is human nature to always feel sentimental about the past, dissatisfied with the present, and hopeful for the future. Therefore, let us seize the future! Children are the representatives of the future, so all our hopes for the future belong entirely to them. We are gradually growing old and becoming useless. Looking at our motherland, plagued by internal and external troubles, all we can do is shake our heads and sigh. No one can think of a way to save it. Our only hope lies in our energetic children, who will one day shoulder the heavy burden of saving the country and its people. They will wield their broadswords and axes to forge a path to survival, so that our poor motherland may finally see the light after darkness.</p>
<p>Beloved children, you are a glimmer of hope in our despair, a ray of light in the darkness! Although we are currently trapped in hell, we look forward to you growing up quickly and saving us. You are the future masters of the motherland. How great is your responsibility! However, you are still in your infancy, like flower buds, like the rising sun, in need of our support and care. But we are ashamed of our weakness. We can only publish this small children's weekly newspaper every Sunday as a humble offering to our beloved little friends, giving you an interesting reading material in addition to running, jumping, and playing on Sundays. Children, with utmost sincerity, we wish you progress in wisdom, virtue, and physical education simultaneously, with boundless advancement!</p>
<h3>China's Woes</h3>
<p>— Jinxie</p>
<p>There is a river that foreigners call "China's Woes." That is the Yellow River.</p>
<p>A German engineer built a model of the Yellow River in Bavaria, about fifty li long, and studied its causes of illness day and night. Such spirit is admirable.</p>
<p>Advancing science can conquer nature. Today, the Yellow River floods thousands of miles in the transition from summer to autumn, submerging tens of thousands of homes and causing terrible floods. However, if we use scientific methods to harness the Yellow River, dredging sand upstream and downstream to deepen the riverbed, then the Yellow River can easily become a second Yangtze River.</p>
<p>It is our shame to have others think of solutions for us. Children, from today on, aspire to become the second German engineer.</p>
<h3>Little Li Bai and the Old Woman</h3>
<p>— Huang Ying</p>
<p>When Li Bai was young, he was most afraid of studying. He said: "Studying is so difficult! Only fools enjoy doing it! Isn't it better to wander around every day?"</p>
<p>One day, this child was wandering alone in the street. A sound, "sha-sha-sha," entered his ears:</p>
<p>"What trick is this?" he thought, feeling strange.</p>
<p>His eyes scanned and saw an old woman squatting on the street corner, grinding an iron rod vigorously against a stone.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" he asked, even more puzzled. He approached the old woman:</p>
<p>The old woman looked up, smiling: "Child, I want to grind it into a needle to sew clothes."</p>
<p>"Aren't you a fool? The iron rod is so thick, how can you grind it into a needle?"</p>
<p>The old woman said kindly: "Child, you are wrong. As long as I grind it every day, grind it hard, I'm not afraid it won't turn into a needle! Do you believe it?"</p>
<p>The child Li Bai was silent. He thought about the old woman's words and realized, "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it." As long as you work hard, is there anything you can't do? So, he rushed home, studied diligently, read every day, read attentively; when he grew up, he became a great poet.</p>
<h3>How Do Cows and Sheep Eat Grass?</h3>
<p>— Xu Zongjie</p>
<p>Children! Can we eat and drink something, swallow it, and then spit it out? Unless you have a stomach illness or are feeling unwell. Otherwise, it always goes from the mouth to the stomach to the intestines, until it becomes waste and is excreted.</p>
<p>How about cows and sheep? When they eat grass, they swallow it whole as quickly as possible, one mouthful, two mouthfuls... continuously. After eating, they vomit it out and chew it slowly. This is called rumination. Why do they "do one thing twice"? Originally, when humans did not domesticate them, they came out to find food, eating while defending against attacks from ferocious beasts, swallowing hastily, and then vomiting it out to savor it carefully. They got used to doing this, and it has been passed down to this day.</p>
<h3>How to Make Your Own Stereoscope</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Real stereoscopes are very expensive and not something we children can afford. However, I now have a very simple self-made method to introduce to you.</p>
<p>First, cut a hard paper into a hard paper frame (shaped like eyeglass frames), then take the cellophane wrapped around cigarette cans and apply two kinds of transparent paint (one coated with orange-yellow, one coated with blue). Paste them separately on the hard paper frame. Strangely, when you use these glasses to look at any picture, you will feel that the pavilions and towers on the picture stand up one by one and become a very beautiful color. Thus, our self-made stereoscope is complete.</p>
<h3>Aren't There Seven People?</h3>
<p>— Xue Fan</p>
<p>The class bell rang, and the children playing in the recreation room jumped and ran into the classroom one after another.</p>
<p>The teacher came in with two chalks and a textbook in his hand. When the students saw the teacher coming in, they all stood up, and the class leader called out: "One—two—three—"</p>
<p>Today, the teacher's lecture was very novel. He didn't just talk about the book. He called out each person's name and asked the students what kind of people were in their families.</p>
<p>"Zhao Yinsheng!" the teacher called.</p>
<p>Zhao Yinsheng stood up.</p>
<h3>Dedicated to Modern Parents</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Shen Bao has such a long history that people often add the word "old" to its name. In fact, we dare not sell "old," but are constantly trying to catch up with the "new" era! Many facts have proven this in the process of last year's 60th anniversary, and the creation of "Children's Weekly" is another example. After we have newly opened this children's garden, we will meet with children all over the country once every Sunday, hoping that thousands of children will come to admire the beautiful flowers and fruits in this garden, and absorb the fresh air in this garden; even more</p>
<p>Aviation, sports, reading, competition, gambling, children, which one do you like?</p>
<p>We hope that modern parents will lead their innocent younger siblings, give them instructions, and guide them; this kind of guidance is more important than any material gift. To expand on this, looking at our national character, there is a risk of increasing depravity, and fundamental transformation must start with children. Modern parents! If you study this important issue and each educates your own children to supplement the inadequacies of school education, so that future citizens will be emerging and strong people, then I dare to believe that tomorrow's China will surely be able to rejuvenate. We compile and publish this weekly to increase the happiness of children, hoping that modern parents and the education community will rise up together and work together.</p>
<p>For the time being, regardless of how serious the national crisis is, and how chaotic the current situation is, let's first implement the transformation of children as the starting point of our work to save the country.</p>
<h3>Three Small Lessons</h3>
<p>— Tao Guihua</p>
<p>(1) Don't fight in your own nest!</p>
<p>My sister and second brother were fighting in the yard, and my mother saw them.</p>
<p>My mother said, "Don't fight in your own nest! If you're good, go fight outside. Your younger brother was bullied by that little Japanese devil, Ah San, from across the street, but you're hiding in the house. Aren't you ashamed to be fighting in your own nest?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, my second brother blushed and said nothing. My sister cried, lying on a short stool.</p>
<p>My mother went over and patted my sister, saying, "Only fools cry! If you're a good child, don't cry. Remember, never fight in your own nest again!"</p>
<p>(2) Unite</p>
<p>My second brother found a thin bamboo pole somewhere, and my sister invited Xiao Fang and Xiao Zhen from my uncle's house, and Xiao Xiong and Xiao Niu from my uncle's house. Including me, there were seven of us.</p>
<p>Each of us picked up a bamboo pole, put it on our shoulders as a gun, lined up, led by my second brother, with my sister as the teacher, and taught us how to drill.</p>
<p>My sister said, "We can't fight in our own nest anymore! My younger brother was bullied by Ah San, and Xiao Xiong and Xiao Niu were bullied by that high-nosed Ah Ying. They dare to bully my younger brother and Xiao Xiong because they are weak and not united. If we are not united, they will dare to bully us. If we want to resist foreign aggression, we must first unite ourselves!"</p>
<p>(3) We Won</p>
<p>Xiao Niu from my uncle's house was carrying a bamboo pole when Ah Ying with the high nose saw him and chased him.</p>
<p>Xiao Niu quickly called out to his sister. My sister rushed out, and my second brother, Xiao Fang, and we all rushed out together.</p>
<p>When Ah Ying saw that we were all coming, he quickly stopped.</p>
<p>Xiao Niu turned the bamboo pole around, pointed at Ah Ying, and said, "It doesn't count as a hero if you run away. Come here, I'll shoot you!"</p>
<p>Ah Ying really came over, and my sister and second brother rushed over, scaring him into turning around and running away.</p>
<p>We laughed, clapped our hands, and sang happily. We won!</p>
<p>"How many people are there in your family?" the teacher asked.</p>
<p>"There are seven people in our family," Zhao Yinsheng replied.</p>
<p>"How are there seven people?" the teacher asked again.</p>
<p>"One father, one mother, two older brothers, one younger sister, and me, isn't that..." Zhao Yinsheng stretched out his small hand, bending and extending each finger.</p>
<p>The teacher smiled and said, "According to what you said, there are only six people in your family!"</p>
<p>Zhao Yinsheng's small eyes looked at the teacher's face, his little face rosy, and he said, "No! Teacher! My mother already has a younger brother in her belly who is about to come out, isn't that seven people?"</p>
<h3>A Star Gazer</h3>
<p>— Tie Feng</p>
<p>There was a clever man who went to the open field every night to observe the stars. Once, he unknowingly walked outside the city. He widened his eyes, single-mindedly looking at the stars, but he didn't pay attention to his feet and fell into a ditch.</p>
<p>This ditch was very deep, and once he fell in, it was not easy to climb out. So, he was in great distress and had to call for help loudly. A passerby heard his cries for help and stopped to see what was going on.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir," he said, "while you are here studying what's in the sky, why don't you look at what's on the ground? Only caring about the sky and not caring about the ground will naturally lead you to fall into the ditch and suffer."</p>
<p>After he said this, he rescued the clever man from the ditch.</p>
<h3>Min'er's Travels</h3>
<p>— Wang Xingyi</p>
<p>Min'er entered the bird country and saw three sparrows finding a small cake at the same time. The yellow sparrow said, "I saw it first, I should eat it!" The black sparrow said, "I saw it first, I should eat it!" The patterned sparrow said, "I saw it first, I should eat it!" They argued endlessly. Min'er raised his thumb and warned them, "Be careful! There's a fox climbing up behind you!" The three sparrows refused to listen and continued to argue. Min'er raised his small hand and warned them, "Be careful! The fox is about to pounce!" The three sparrows refused to listen and continued to argue! Min'er clapped his small hands and warned, "Be careful! The fox is pouncing!" With a tragic cry, the fox bit the black sparrow! Stomped on the small cake!</p>
<p>Min'er stared with his small eyes and said, "Who told you not to listen to me and be busy arguing among yourselves?"</p>
<h3>Small Jokes</h3>
<p>— Yang Ru</p>
<p>Tou Tou Ali doesn't like to play or work with friends. He always stays at home with cats, foreign dogs, white geese, and the like. Once, his father said, "Ali, today is Sunday, you should go to see your friend Tou Tou. It's not good to stay at home all the time." Ali listened and walked outside the door. He happened to meet a classmate, so he bumped his head against his classmate's head and ran back. The classmate asked inexplicably, "Are you crazy?" Ali used a sharp throat, running and shouting, "My father told me to bump heads!"</p>
<p>The barber father asked Jia'er, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" Jia'er said, "I want to be a barber when I grow up." The father said strangely and angrily, "The child has no ambition at all and says he wants to be a lowly barber!" Jia'er quickly said, "Dad, barbers are not lowly, they are very noble! Don't you see that big shots and presidents also take off their hats when they see them?"</p>
<h3>Children Gathering Firewood</h3>
<p>— Mai Ying</p>
<p>Dad went to pull a rickshaw, Mom went to sell vegetables, my sister stayed at home to guard the door, and I went to pick up firewood with three friends. We four rubbed our hands together, carried a broken basket, and walked towards the suburbs.</p>
<p>The branches and leaves on the trees kept falling to the ground, and we all picked them up and put them in the basket. We don't need to compete, we don't need to grab, everyone picks up firewood, and when the basket is full, we go home. We pick up firewood separately, and when we come back, our bodies are pressed tightly together. We form a line and walk in the middle of the road. Adults walk by, but we don't give way and watch them walk on the side of the road one by one.</p>
<p>Our hair is all messed up by the wind, and our noses are all reddened by the wind. We laugh, we sing, we are happy.</p>
<h3>Children's Intelligence Quiz</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Reading the American Journal of Child Education, I saw intelligence quiz questions for children and tried them on my younger siblings. I found them very interesting. So, I copied two of them to share with readers. Children, try them with your peers after class.</p>
<p>Question 1: In a park, there is an adult and a child sitting on a long bench. The adult said to the child, "Child, are you my biological son?" The child nodded and replied, "Yes, I am your biological son!" The adult said to the child again, "Then call me Dad!" The child shook his head, indicating that he was unwilling. The adult said again, "Since you are my biological son, why are you unwilling to call me Dad?" The child replied, "I will never call you Dad!"</p>
<p>Please answer in the shortest possible time why the child is unwilling to call the adult Dad.</p>
<p>Question 2: An iron electric pole is buried very deep in the mud, and it is simply impossible to shake it even with great force. There is another five-foot-long iron chain, as thick as an arm, locking a cow. A pile of hay is placed five feet away from the cow in the same straight line. Now the cow wants to eat this pile of hay. The distance from the electric pole to the pile of hay is one zhang, and the cow is five feet away from the pile of hay. The electric pole and the iron chain are very strong, and it is not allowed to move the hay. How can the cow comfortably and naturally eat this pile of hay?</p>
<p>Please say in the shortest possible time how the cow can eat the grass. Answer; (1) The adult is the child's mother, so the child is unwilling to call him Dad, because the adult in the question does not specify a man or a woman. (2) The cow can eat the dry grass by taking one step forward. The question does not state that the iron chain is on the electric pole, so even though the iron chain is long and the electric pole is strong, they are useless.</p>
<h3>To All Children in the Country (1)</h3>
<p>— Xi Shi</p>
<p>Dear Children!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw an advertisement in the Shen Bao's Spring and Autumn supplement, which said that elementary school teachers and experts in elementary education were invited to write articles for you to read. I was overjoyed and used my unskilled writing to greet my lovely children for the first time.</p>
<p>Children! How happy you are. In school, you have happy songs to sing, all kinds of interesting games, and many experts have written countless books that suit your tastes. According to my old experience, I initially read the books of sages and could not see a book specially for children. Now, in addition to congratulating and blessing you, I hope that you will study hard. I allow you to not have formed the habit of reading, but the enlightenment of conscience can overthrow the power of habit. Finally, I hope that you will give your teacher your true heart. I believe that your teacher will love you even more. I wish you happiness! Your companion Xi Shi</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Dear Children!</p>
<p>What are your thoughts after reading the first letter? I earnestly hope that you will also communicate with me and tell me what you want to say. I am your most enthusiastic and most loyal friend.</p>
<p>Children, today I am here to tell you a story that I want you to remember firmly. During the European War, there was an old lady in France who had three sons. The two eldest sons died on the battlefield, but she still wanted her third son to go to the battlefield and join the battle. Others persuaded her and said, "Old lady, this is your last son, do you still want him to go to war?" The old lady replied in a firm tone, "Of course, I am extremely sad about the death of my sons, but although I love my sons, I especially love my country. My sons do not belong to me, but belong to the country. They have always received the country's benefits. Now that the country is dying, they naturally should repay the country with their lives." Dear children, I hope your mothers do not belittle themselves.</p>
<p>Children, I will quickly collect this letter. I wish you happiness! Your loyal companion Xi Shi</p>
<p>▲ Rise Early in Autumn Rise early in autumn, go to the garden, the flowers bloom, the birds sing; breathe fresh air to strengthen the body; with a strong body, establish ambition, reading and doing things are easy. ▲ Ding Ding Ding Autumn Ding Ding Ding! Go to class, Ding Ding Ding! After class, do not be afraid of being busy with homework every day! Do not waste precious time! If you do not work hard when you are young, you will only be sad when you are old!</p>

One is Tung Wah vs. Ealing, at 2:00 PM at the baseball field, and the other is Tsinghua vs. West Point, at 3:00 PM at Hongkou Park. The winners will enter the second round. Tung Wah newly acquired Dai Linjing, who returned from Java, to play center forward. It should not be difficult to defeat Ealing, which qualified from Group B, and win the second round. Tsinghua and West Point will have another fierce battle. In yesterday's two Stott Cup games, West Point defeated French Business 6-5. The match was evenly matched and very exciting. The game between Sestese and Italian Navy was postponed due to a dispute that occurred in the Italian Navy last week. There is also a Group A game today, Jinan vs. Yu You, which will be held at 4:00 PM at the baseball field, after the Tung Wah vs. Ealing game. The schedule and team lineups for today are recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, West Point Eliminated French Business in the Stott Cup - 6-5 -</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, in Yiyuan, there was a Stott Cup second-week game. West Point eliminated French Business 6-5 and won the second round. The excitement of the game was unseen in the Western League this season. In the first half, West Point took the lead with 4-2. The referee was Le Xiurong, and there were about three to four thousand spectators, half Chinese and half Western, which was rare for a Western game.</p>
<p>▲ Game Situation The Chinese who came to watch were definitely there to appreciate the skills, and fortunately, they were not disappointed. West Point had fast forwards, skillful passes, and excellent header skills. The defense line used a combined center-back line to defend against the enemy, making the opponent sigh in despair. Therefore, even though there were strong generals like Gu Site Pike, they were eventually subdued. Within ten minutes of the start of the game, West Point broke the enemy with 2-1. Pike charged alone to make it 2-2. But West Point scored twice in a row, and the first half ended with 4-2. In the second half, West Point still controlled the situation, keeping the ball at their feet and creating an extremely advantageous situation of 6-3. French Business was at a loss. Fortunately, after a final effort, the game ended with 6-5, and French Business was eliminated. Judging from the game situation, Tung Wah will also have a hard time meeting them.</p>

<h3>19th Annual International Race: Four Nations Compete, Starts at 8 AM This Morning at Carter Road Intersection, Finish Line at Recreation Ground, Total Distance Over 15 Miles</h3>
<p>- Intense Competition Between China and England. The 19th Annual International Race will commence at 8:00 AM this morning at the intersection of Carter Road (now Nanjing West Road) and finish inside the Recreation Ground on Route Tenant de la Tour (now Huaihai Road). The total distance is 15 miles and 263 yards, approximately 2 miles shorter than previous years. Therefore, racers are expected to arrive at the Recreation Ground around 10:15 AM. Spectators may proceed to the Recreation Ground to wait. No tickets are required, but those with triangular seating passes gifted by the International Race Association will be seated in a special section near the finish line. A large crowd of Chinese and foreign dignitaries and sports enthusiasts is anticipated. To maintain order, the association has specially requested the assistance of the Chinese Boy Scouts. Due to the extensive area encompassing the grounds, racer entry, spectator stands, spectator entrance, and awards presentation area, a significant number of personnel are needed. Therefore, additional support has been requested from Moore Memorial Church, the East Asia Physical Education Academy, Shanghai High School, Minli Middle School, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Fudan University, and Guanghua University, totaling over 500 individuals. Led by Commander Wang Gang, Deputy Commanders Leng Xueqiao, Long Jingyuan, Sun Yixin, Luo Lie, and Xie Yanbo, Jiang Yinsheng, and others will be responsible for ensuring orderliness. Furthermore, of the 20 members of the Chinese team, three have not provided their Chinese names. Someone has already explained to the Chinese Racing Association that number 26 is Yu Bohu, number 50 is Wang Linkang, and one person (Y.T. Shen) remains unidentified, which is deeply regrettable. Additionally, Mayor Wu of Shanghai has specially awarded a large silver cup to the champion, and Cheng Yize, Chairman of the Chinese Racing Association, will also present a silver cup to the racer with the best form, in the interest of promoting proper technique. The route is as follows:</p>
<h3>▲ Full Route</h3>
<p>Starting from the intersection of Carter Road (now Nanjing West Road) and Jing'an Temple Road, proceed along Jing'an Temple Road, Jessfield Road (now Wanhangdu Road), Brenan Road (now YuYuan Road), Robison Road (now Changde Road), turn onto Hongqiao Road, Haig Road (now Hengshan Road), Avenue Joffre (now Huaihai Middle Road), Rue Pere Froc (now Ruijin Road), Route Ghislain (now South Shanxi Road), Avenue Lafayette (now Fuxing Middle Road), Route Tenant de la Tour (now Huaihai Middle Road), heading south to enter the Recreation Ground and finish north of the jujube tree on the east side.

<h3>▲ Competition Between China and England</h3>
<p>Although four countries are participating, the actual competition is primarily between China and England. England is fielding its entire team from last year, all seasoned veterans with extensive experience and strong capabilities. China, on the other hand, is deploying a new force. They must exert great effort, and with diligent practice, it may be possible for China to maintain its superiority.</p>
<h3>▲ Boy Scout Service</h3>
<p>Regarding today's International Race, the association previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Boy Scout Affairs Council, requesting that Boy Scouts be dispatched to maintain order at the Recreation Ground finish line and assist with collecting entrance tickets.

<h3>Ministry of Education Appoints Wu Yunrui as Chief Editor for Secondary School Physical Education Teaching Syllabus</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's Jiangnan University Football Game: Guanghua vs. Central Ends in a Draw</h3>
<p>- Zero to Zero -</p>
<p>Today Guanghua will play Jinling (Nanjing, 9th) - The Jiangnan University Football Championship game between Central and Guanghua began at 2:30 PM on the 9th at Central University. The referee was Zhang Xinfu. After the start, Guanghua launched an aggressive attack with great momentum, but their shots lacked precision. Although the Central goal was repeatedly threatened, none of the shots found the net. After a long period of contention, Central was penalized with a 12-yard penalty kick. Just when Central was in imminent danger, Deng Youzeng unfortunately kicked the ball wide to the right corner, missing the goal by half a foot, which was a great pity. Due to the rainy weather, the field was muddy and slippery, preventing either side from delivering a surprising performance. After the break, the teams switched goals. Central, benefiting from the headwind, adjusted their strategy and launched a major offensive. Guanghua focused on both offense and defense. Both sides fought hard but achieved nothing. Until ten minutes before the end of the game, the ball reached Guanghua's goal with great force. Guanghua's Zhou Yanyi defended bravely, forcefully heading the ball upwards to prevent it from going in. However, due to excessive force, he failed to head the ball and collapsed unconscious for several minutes. After massage and artificial respiration, he gradually recovered and continued to play. Not long after, Dong Shuzhao also fell to the ground due to severe pain after being kicked in the left instep. Unable to bear the pain, he left the field, forcing Guanghua to defend with ten players until the end of the game. The match ended in a draw. On the 11th, Guanghua will play Jinling to determine the winner.</p>
<h3>Xiqing Basketball Tournament: Shanghai Loses to International</h3>

The game between International and Shanghai was the most exciting, with frequent lead changes. The game between Jiangwan and Nanxing was less eventful. In Group B, the game between Shanghai Middle School and American School was the most intense. The other games were much more lopsided. There will be no games tonight. The details of yesterday's games are as follows:</p>

<p>▲ Jiangwan defeated Nanxing. The first basket was scored by Zhou Shuan of Nanxing. However, Jiangwan quickly took the lead with a score of 7-2. Subsequently, Jiangwan adopted a five-man unified defense and attack formation, making it difficult for Nanxing to develop their offense. When the score reached 18-10, Nanxing suddenly made a strong surge, scoring seven points in a row. At halftime, Jiangwan held a slight advantage of 19-17. In the second half, Jiangwan's momentum increased, with Zhou Dayun and Zhao Butian scoring effectively. The score soared to 47-30 at the end.</p>

<p>▲ International defeated Shanghai. Qian Jingzhu successfully made a free throw, giving Shanghai an early lead. In an instant, Shanghai led 9-2. International launched a swift counterattack, with Chen Xianglong enjoying good fortune, scoring several consecutive baskets and narrowing the score to 10-11. However, the three forwards lacked coordination, and International trailed 20-25 at halftime. After the break, Chen Xianglong's performance improved, scoring three more consecutive baskets to put International ahead 26-25. The young players from Shanghai put in a spirited performance, and International fell behind again, 28-36. Who would have expected that victory would ultimately belong to International? Liang Guoquan's shots were incredibly skilled, with unexpected and ingenious moves. Both Chinese and foreign spectators applauded, and his performance was universally praised. International narrowly escaped defeat, winning 44-39 against the brave and fierce Shanghai team.</p>

The referees were Shen Lince and the club directors Lin Kanghou and Zhu Zhuanghua. They were all on time and a lot of spectators came to watch. First, Zhou Shoufu opened the game, and the players immediately began to chase each other's scores. The point difference was usually between one and two points. Scores like 99, 101, 132, and 127 were shown on the scoreboard. Zhou's score was 173 and Xu's score was 166, which had a small difference.

Students from the same school (Zhongfa) who were watching from the outside also verbally abused the referee. While their skills may be commendable, their sportsmanship is lacking. It is hoped that the school will urge them to improve. Furthermore, the Zhuangshi Xing Group has two teams, Zhongfa and Jianhua, with equal scores. A final match will be held at 7:50 AM today. The Xiaoyou Group also has two teams, Hongmao and Youer, with equal scores. A final match will be held at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Outlying Regions: Ministry of Education to Hold Academic Degree Examinations</h3>
<p>- Held Annually - (Nanjing, 9th) The Ministry of Education will hold examinations for doctoral and other academic degrees. The Legislative Yuan's Examination and Selection Committee and the Administrative Regulations Committee have drafted an Academic Degree Law separately. Once the draft is finalized, it will be jointly reviewed with the relevant authorities before being promulgated. In general, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral examinations will be held once a year, strictly selecting talent. Graduates from domestic or foreign universities are eligible to participate in the examinations. Foreign students studying in China are also eligible to participate. The Newsound Society reports that the Ministry of Education, recognizing the increasing number of students returning from overseas in recent years, whose academic credentials consist solely of a master's or doctoral degree, with no means of verifying their actual level of competence, has drafted an Academic Degree Law to ensure a reliable assessment of academic achievement and to establish the qualifications of university students and returned students. The Newsound Society's Beijing correspondent has learned that the Academic Degree Law has been drafted separately by three organizations: the Examination Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Administrative Regulations Committee. The plan is to hold academic degree examinations once a year, divided into three levels: doctoral, master's, and bachelor's. Each level will admit ten candidates. Anyone who has graduated from a domestic university without studying abroad, or who has obtained a master's or doctoral degree abroad, must participate in the examination to ensure strict standards. Details will be announced after the three organizations have finalized the draft and the Legislative Yuan has reviewed and approved it, and the National Government has issued an order for promulgation.</p>
<h3>Hubei Education Commissioner Striving for Independent Funding for Education</h3>

<h3>Jiangxi Education Bureau Bans Records by Li Jinhui's School</h3>
<p>(Datong News Agency, Nanchang Dispatch) Since its establishment under the order of Chairman Xiong, the Jiangxi Province Music Education Promotion Committee, under the jurisdiction of the Education Bureau, has spared no effort in banning music that harms public morals. Recently, at its sixth meeting, it was resolved to strictly prohibit the circulation of records by Li Jinhui's school in the province. In Nanchang, the committee has dispatched personnel, accompanied by members of the Public Security Bureau, to inspect gramophone records in movie theaters and confiscate records sold in stores. A resolution has been passed to submit the banned operas to the Education Bureau, which will then jointly issue an order with the Civil Affairs Bureau to the county governments for uniform compliance.</p>

<h3>School Faculty and Students of Tongji Advanced Vocational School Discuss the School</h3>
<p>▲Request to Exempt the Sealing of the Old Laoda School Property in Jiangwan: After the former Labor University site in Jiangwan was allocated to the National Tongji University Advanced Vocational School, the school moved from its old site in Wusong to the Laoda site. Renovations were made and classes began, and everything was gradually taking shape. Unfortunately, the former Labor University had a dispute with the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank over a loan issue, and as a result of the lawsuit, the Shanghai District Court is about to carry out a sealing order. According to Tang Yin of Tongji University Advanced Vocational School, the portion of the former Labor University's Jiangwan school property was allocated to the school by the 354th meeting of the Central Political Council. As for the previous debts of the Labor University, national authorities are responsible for repayment, and the school should not be implicated or sealed off, which would lead to the interruption of classes. The entire faculty and students of the school firmly oppose this act of undermining education, hoping to uphold the dignity of national education. The school has already telegraphed the central authorities requesting a swift halt to this matter.</p>
<p>▲Declaration of the School Protection Association: National Tongji University, in May of this year, received a transfer from the Ministry of Education, under the explicit order of the Central Political Council, to take over the Jiangwan portion of the former Labor University's property and establish the school as the only national institution for implementing production education. Now, due to a loan dispute between the previously confiscated two model factories for vagrants and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the bank has petitioned the Shanghai District Court to forcibly seal the school. We deeply fear that if this is carried out, classes will be interrupted. The entire faculty and students are in a state of panic. The school's property, although mostly inherited from the former two model factories for vagrants, was confiscated as enemy property by the Shanghai Political Subcommittee when the revolutionary army reached Shanghai during the Northern Expedition and used to establish the former Labor University. Whether the bank's claim exists is still in question. Now, the Ministry of Education, following the resolution of the Central Political Council, has ordered National Tongji University to take over and use the property. The transfer of property rights has been repeated again and again. The school is not the main debtor, which is clear and explicit. Moreover, this debt has long been entrusted by the Central Government to the Committee for the Adjustment of Internal and External Debts of the Ministry of Finance for unified management. The transfer of debt is a uniform method for the Ministry of Finance to handle all correct or pending debts of public and private institutions of the pre-revolutionary government. This disposal method has special characteristics and is fundamentally different from the transfer of general debts. If ordinary legal sanctions are applied, there will be many practical obstacles. The country is now facing many difficulties, industry is declining, the countryside is bankrupt, and the lives and national destiny are on the verge of collapse. Our school adheres to the central government's intention to promote vocational education, cultivate production talents with both knowledge and skills, meet the urgent needs of the country, and extend the life of the nation in danger. This mission is of great importance and cannot be taken lightly. Moreover, our school was founded at the beginning and has been managed with great effort to achieve today's situation. The bank, as a financial institution, should take it as its responsibility to support production and revitalize society. However, it disregards the overall situation of the country and the dignity of education, and even disregards the authority of the central government, insisting on its own way on the issue of debt claims that have not yet been finalized, attempting to destroy the life of our school and put vocational education in a position of eternal ruin. In order to maintain the authority of the central government and the dignity of education, and to complete the mission, the faculty and students of the school firmly oppose this destructive act and hope that the national education community and compatriots from all walks of life will give us sympathy and assistance. Education is fortunate, and the school is fortunate. We hereby present this to you, hoping for your public consideration.</p>
<p>▲Petitioning Various Institutions: Yesterday morning, special representatives Deng Cheng, Xue Zhihao, Hu Qinye, Du Xianliu, and Min Naiguang were sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government, Municipal Party Department, Municipal Education Bureau, University Education Federation, and Vocational Education Society to petition. They were received separately and promised strong assistance, resulting in a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>▲Express Mail Telegram from Faculty and Students: To the national education community and all newspapers, please be advised that a telegram has been sent to various central government agencies, stating: (To the Central Political Council, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Judicial Administration: The school is facing a forced sealing order by the Shanghai District Court due to a loan dispute between the former Labor University and the Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, which will interrupt classes. The school is in a state of panic. The school is not the main debtor and should not be implicated innocently. The entire faculty and students firmly oppose this and request a swift telegram to stop it in order to maintain education.) We hereby send this telegram and hope for your sympathy and assistance in maintaining education. We are extremely anxious.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Re-entering Paradise</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw an aphorism in a composition assignment: (Evil arises from intense anger and passionate vengeful desires.) Reading the newspaper this morning and seeing the telegrams from New York and Paris about the declaration of the repeal of Prohibition, I felt even more that the aphorism captured the truth. The Americans were so strict in enforcing Prohibition, and various political parties even listed it in their platforms as one of their campaign tools. Although I don't drink at all, I couldn't understand it no matter how hard I tried. Sometimes when I watch movies about their smuggling and drunkenness, I find it very interesting. The more it is forbidden, the more eagerly it is sought, and the more cleverly it is planned. The negative effect of oppression almost always leads to a comedy. With the opening of Prohibition, countless people in New York held enthusiastic celebrations in major hotels. A saloon owner, who was eighty-two years old, happily returned to his old business and combined French liquors with a drink called (Re-entering Paradise) to commemorate the occasion. American expatriates in Paris also held wet festivals in most bars, using puppets to represent Prohibition as an evil woman, as tall as a person. After being displayed, they were burned. (Both seen in the special telegram from the 7th edition of this newspaper.) This is clearly a concrete manifestation of vengeful desires after prolonged oppression.</p>
<p>Freud's psychoanalysis explains psychological abnormalities as being expressed in some form due to certain desires not being satisfied. Once drinkers are able to drink their fill, they feel like they are (re-entering paradise); and those who interfere with their drinking are seen as (evil women). By extension, when (life) feels threatened, it is even more common for people to disregard life and death in order to satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>Therefore, although I don't drink at all, I have infinite sympathy for the psychology of American alcoholics!</p>
<h3>On Courtesy</h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>The scope of courtesy discussed here is limited to (the courtesy of merchants).</p>
<p>I often dare not enter or am unwilling to enter those stores where I have been given a cold shoulder. It's not that I like flattery, but because of their unpleasant (long faces). They do business as if you are an impolite employee, and they are impatient customers.</p>
<p>The attitude of merchants towards customers is not only different between China and foreign countries, but also between the north and the south of our own country. In the north, there are quite a few employees who are very kind. They see you out, and if it is an old-fashioned store, they will even lift the curtain for you, or at least say (goodbye) kindly from behind the counter. Good employees, even if you go through a lot of trouble choosing and end up not buying anything, will still smile, at most puff out their cheeks and remain silent, rarely complaining. In the south, the situation is much worse, but I don't need to tell the readers in this environment about how southern stores lack good attitudes, and I also don't need to introduce this situation to northerners, because that is also unnecessary.</p>
<p>F.C. Kelly says in his (Capitalizing Courtesy): (Courtesy can also be considered capital. Many businesses succeed because of courtesy, and many fail because of a lack of good courtesy.) That is indeed true.</p>
<p>In fact, courtesy itself is something that doesn't cost any money, and at the same time, it is indeed the most useful thing. Using a (smiling face) to say polite words and using a (long face) to say sharp and venomous words takes the same amount of effort. If those merchants knew that (laughing three times a day is good for physical and mental health), then for the sake of their own health, they might as well put on a good attitude. At the very least, I think they also understand the saying that anger can stir up liver Yang. However, few merchants implement this remedy. They would rather stroke their spleens and stomachs to drive away customers than put on a good face! For the sake of themselves and their customers.</p>
<p>It is said that once, a rich girl wore simple clothes to a large silk shop, chose very harshly, and ended up being cursed out by the shop assistant with a raised voice, leaving empty-handed and with a flushed face. Not long after, she wore gorgeous new clothes, rode in her own car, paid three hundred yuan at the counter first, and then specified the same shop assistant to cut the cloth for her. The cloth she wanted was all on the highest floor. She casually pointed to a bolt of cloth and asked for six feet, and then said:</p>
<p>(Oh, that bolt of cloth in the east corner is really beautiful, go get it for me!) Five minutes later, the shop assistant was ordered to move the ladder to the west... She cut more than thirty different or even the same kinds of cloth like this. She sat comfortably in the chair, casually pointing east and west at the high places. Even though it was early winter, the shop assistant was so exhausted that his legs were sore and he was steaming.</p>
<p>I think, on the girl's side, it was just (spending money to relieve disasters) and vent her anger, but this is definitely not something that every insulted buyer can do, and not everyone is willing to do it. Perhaps in the eyes of the counter clerk, the impoliteness of his clerk has also become (capital). However, even if there is such a (devoted) shop assistant who sincerely wants to do this kind of good business born out of rudeness, for the sake of the store's future, I'm afraid it's still hard to find an owner who is willing to adopt this method to expand the business.</p>
<h3>Village Opera: Xu Zhuanpeng</h3>
<p>In September and October, after the rice harvest, golden rice stalks were stacked in piles under large umbrella-shaped pine trees. Buckwheat had also been sown, but the harvest was still far off. Farmers were relatively free. During these months, various small villages and towns often took turns inviting opera troupes to perform, but this was in previous years. In recent years, there have been fewer opera troupes. It is said that the actors have changed careers, and there are even no new people learning to perform. An opera troupe of dozens of roles often couldn't even make enough for food. Occasionally finding a place to perform, it was difficult to find a second place to go.</p>
<p>This year, Li Village invited an opera troupe for the opening ceremony of the temple, for the sake of the gods, as usual. This news had been spread around the surrounding twenty or thirty li of small villages and towns for a long time. When the date arrived, peddlers came from all directions with hopeful dreams, surrounding the opera venue, setting up cloth curtains, and building grass sheds. Gamblers also came with tea-selling women, in groups of twos and threes, surveying the scene for placing gambling tables, like helmsmen watching the wind and clouds a few days before:</p>
<p>(Judging by this situation, there may not be much profit. There are fewer people gambling these days...) They speculated with such worries.</p>
<p>The surrounding villages were buzzing. Women dressed up, and children wore new clothes and were carried on their fathers' backs to join in the fun.</p>
<p>Every household in Li Village had guests, many distant or close relatives and friends. The poorest household in the village, Li Dasheng's, also had more than a dozen guests. They arrived on the first day of the opera and wanted to watch until the last day before going back.</p>
<p>(Even if there is food, there is no place to sleep...)</p>
<p>He and his wife discussed, beginning to curse the pointlessness of this opera performance. They gave their own bed to the guests and slept in the granary. The rice was borrowed, only a few dozen catties, but the number of guests increased day by day. Poor people and rich people had the same group of friends coming and going, and poor people even liked friends more.</p>
<p>The night opera began, and the kerosene lamps on the stage were lit. Locusts seeking light flew in from the fields, and the crowds seeking entertainment gathered in front of the stage just like the locusts. Gongs, drums, and flutes sounded. The first play was the Peach Garden Oath of Brotherhood, with a drunken Li Bai, a black-faced Zhang Fei, and a red-faced Guan Yunchang. The second play was the Nun's Meeting, flower boats, and other romantic stories. When the farmers saw the female roles on stage, they opened their wide mouths and laughed loudly, while the women sitting on the benches on both sides giggled silently. They were entertaining themselves.</p>
<p>The opera troupe was scheduled to perform for four days and four nights. By the third day, most of the peddlers had packed up their curtains and were preparing to leave. Their dreams of hope were shattered like raindrops. All kinds of business were sluggish, and the peddler selling Yiwu candy also reduced the price, calling out in a broken, hoarse voice:</p>
<p>(White sugar, one copper coin a piece, two pieces for one copper coin!) The opera troupe left, and the guests left. Fatigue, loneliness, and emptiness enveloped the village. What did the villagers get? Many families were in debt for a large amount of rice.</p>
<p>Thinking about the consumption for this opera performance, their faces were as gray as the sky on a snowy day.</p>
<h3>Small Notes from a Traveler's Window</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Thirteen</p>
<p>"Ink China" includes six short letters from Zhu Yunming (Zhishan). The third letter is most indicative of the author's style. It reads:</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw the calligraphy from Fei Qing's family. Although it is from the Song Dynasty, many parts are missing and damaged, but the price is high. Please go there and say that someone else wants it. Agree on a price within ten taels; if it's more, don't bother. Stop by my house after you come back. Please, please! Immediately, Yunming bows. Huai Chan.</p>
<p>This letter clearly shows that Zhu Yunming was a book lover, and the "sayings" style of writing shows naturalness and honesty. However, after all, this kind of style belongs to the Ming people, and we don't need to learn it. If we want to promote this style and ask people to deliberately imitate it, the result will only be more ornamental antiques of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Fourteen</p>
<p>Besides the "Miscellaneous Writings," I haven't found Chen Meigong's collected works yet. "Ink China" includes ten of his letters. As the editor said, Meigong's letters are extremely stylish, such as the ninth letter:</p>
<p>Fifteen years of not seeing you is like longing for the ancients. Yesterday I saw you, and the morning star was still in the sky. I send you yellow rice cakes. Mr. Xu Tianchi is an individualist, and I hope you can briefly show me his life so that I can fulfill the responsibility to the deceased. I seek old paper stained with old brushes as a treasure. Yours sincerely, Chen Jiru.</p>
<p>The wording is very humorous and elegant. The tenth letter says: It's very congested, I miss you very much. The old man was in the small building. Your second work is extremely lonely and strong. Since parting from the ancients, I haven't seen this kind of poem for a long time. If the weather is clear tomorrow, I will go to Bocheng and invite you to warm up by the stove and drink a glass of winter solstice wine. Sincerely, Chen Jiru. I return the old paper, waiting for your inspiration, no need to bother the old hand again in the cold. It can be seen that Meigong liked to make witty remarks in his letters. The editor commented, (Meigong's best writing is here, and its limitations are also here), which is a knowledgeable statement.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (54)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Afterwards, he turned to his son:</p>
<p>(Do you see, huh, do you see your mother is sick? Have you at least examined her?)</p>
<p>Bi'er replied:</p>
<p>(No, I didn't see anything wrong with her.)</p>
<p>So Luo Lan got angry:</p>
<p>(Are you blind, damn it! If you can't even tell that your mother is not feeling well, then why be a doctor? Take a look, huh, take a look at her. Really, this is just blind, you careless doctor!)</p>
<p>Luo Lan's mother was breathing heavily and her face was pale, so her husband shouted:</p>
<p>(Look, she's about to faint!)</p>
<p>(No... no... it's okay... it will pass in a while... it's okay), Mrs. Luo Lan said intermittently.</p>
<p>Bi'er walked closer, staring at her and said:</p>
<p>(Hey, what's wrong with you?)</p>
<p>She said in a low voice, hastily and repeatedly:</p>
<p>(Nothing... nothing... really... nothing.)</p>
<p>Luo Lan went to get vinegar; he returned and handed the vinegar bottle to his son and said:</p>
<p>(Hey... use vinegar to freshen her up. At least take her pulse!)</p>
<p>When Bi'er bent down to take her pulse, she quickly pulled her hand away, even bumping into a chair next to her.</p>
<p>(Okay,) he said in a cold voice, (let me examine you, since you're sick.)</p>
<p>So she stretched out her arm to him. Her skin was hot, and her pulse was beating chaotically and rapidly. He muttered:</p>
<p>(Really, this is quite serious. You should take some sedatives. I'll write you a prescription.)</p>
<p>As he bent over to write on the paper, a low voice containing hasty sighs, suffocation, and short, suppressed breaths made him suddenly turn around.</p>
<p>She was crying, holding her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Luo Lan was shocked and asked her:</p>
<p>(Luiz, Luiz, what's wrong? What's really wrong with you?)</p>
<p>She didn't answer, as if she had been shattered by a deep and hateful sadness.</p>
<p>Her husband wanted to take her hand, to take her hand away from her face. She refused, saying again and again:</p>
<p>(No, no, no.)</p>
<p>He turned to his son:</p>
<p>(What's wrong with her? I've never seen her like this before.)</p>
<p>(It's nothing serious,) Bi'er said, (it's just a minor nervous episode. It's common for mothers at this age to have this. Maybe she will have such episodes often in the future.)</p>
<p>Seeing her in such pain, he felt his heart relax a little. This pain reduced his resentment and reduced the debt of his mother's disgrace. He stared at her like a judge satisfied with his work.</p>
<p>But she suddenly stood up and ran to the door. She ran so fast that no one could have expected it or stopped her, so she ran and locked herself in her room.</p>
<p>Luo Lan and the doctor looked at each other.</p>
<p>(Do you understand the reason for this at all?) one said.</p>
<p>(Understand,) the other replied, (It's just because of some nervous discomfort. It's common for moms at this age to have this problem. Maybe she'll have such episodes often in the future.)</p>

<h3>Commercial News Financial News: Short-Covering Potential Strong, Speculation Buoyant - Continued Rise of $7.70 - Despite US Bank's Exchange Rate Cut, Exchange Rates Rise, Market Flat and Weak, Short-Covering Fervently Rises, Buying Momentum Flaring, Situation Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>The gold market's buying momentum continues fiercely, rising again yesterday. Bullish parties are actively driving up prices, while short-covering potential is growing significantly. This is because bullish positions in this term's swap market are gaining considerable advantage, leading to robust investor confidence. Although speculator Mr. Wu offered supply, it had little impact. Demand exceeded supply in the market. Speculator Mr. Yang bought heavily, and banks were unable to digest it smoothly, leading to a tight domestic market.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, although overseas silver markets declined, exchange rates saw a rebound. US cotton fell five points, US wheat contracted 1.625 points, and stocks fell one dollar. However, London's spot gold rose nine pence. US official gold purchase prices remained unchanged. Initial open prices were slightly lower, and speculator Mr. Wu sold, but the situation remained stable. After opening, brokers actively bought US dollars, tightening the exchange rate market. HSBC's US dollar listing further narrowed by 0.125, and the market rebounded. However, there were still many outstanding positions, and investor confidence was further strengthened, continuing to tighten the domestic market. The situation was most bullish at noon. The market initially weakened in the first half of the day but then recovered. Overseas news was quiet, lacking special developments. The cash price was $1,075. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was the same as the previous close, at $701.70. Goods opened at $1.50. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1s 3.5625d for British pounds and $33.6875 for US dollars. Party C興 entered the market and sold, then prices dropped to $1.20. Investor confidence was very stable, and brokers were also buying. Internal US dollar market gradually tightened. 恒餘, 志豐, 永義, 大永, 大興, 永義豐, 永福, 泰亨, and 咸進 rose to $4.20. 正金 sold March half-dollar contracts, 元茂永 sold at $22.20. It was predicted that HSBC's listing would be flat for British pounds and down 0.125 for US dollars. 源茂, 恒興, 永元, 豐永, 同益, 志豐, 永順利, etc., bought contracts, pushing prices up to $6. 三井 sold March US dollar contracts for $0.375. 元茂, 永志豐, 永義, 大永, 順利, 正昌, etc., slightly divested, and prices fell to $4.40. However, brokers actively covered short positions, and the internal market continued to tighten. Under heavy buying by 永豐, 大德成, 元茂永, 義大永, 大興, 永益餘, etc., prices rose to beyond $8. HSBC sold February contracts for $34, slightly downstream, but 大興 and 永益餘 continued to buy, 正昌 and 元豐永 also bought.麦加利 sold March US dollar contracts for $0.25, but was quickly unable to close, and prices rose to $8.80. 益餘 and 恒興 took advantage of the high prices to divest. Although 元茂永 bought, goods were also sold, and prices fell to $7.70. 兆豐, 昌福, 餘萬興 bought contracts, and the situation remained strong, continuing to rise. However, many who had a $9 limit sold off. The noon closing price thus retreated from $708.90 to $708.80. Goods were auctioned at the same price. After the market closed, 順利 and 恒興 supplied contracts, but as goods and 元茂永, etc., were still being purchased, the struggle was quite stable. The highest price in the first half of the day was $708.90, and the lowest price was $701.20, with a fluctuation of $7.70. As a result, it continued to rise $7.10 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was because HSBC's US dollar listing narrowed by 0.125 to $33.25, corresponding to a bid gold price of over $721. Based on the closing price, it was approximately $13 below, $4 less than the previous close. The current month's book entry price was $715, and January's was $709. The morning water supplement was $715. The cash price was $1,075. There was not much trading in the market. 盈豐恒 sold 200 taels to the Tianjin gang for $1,076.50. After entering, the Tianjin gang also came to divest, selling 200 taels to 盈豐恒 and 泰康潤中 for $1,077. In addition, Dalian goods once traded at $1,075.50. The current month's contracts still numbered 4,438.</p>
<p>In the market, buyers were dominant. In summary, 大興, 永大, 昌祥, 鴻興, 祥和, 大德成, 永豐恒, 泰盈豐恒, 恒興源, 恒昌, 永大康, 元茂, 永義大永, etc., were on the buying side. 丙興, 恒餘, 大發, 永元, 春惠, 祥義豐, 永昌升, 永乾, 昌祥, 福餘, 志豐, 永順利, etc., were on the buying side. 源茂益餘永德 advanced first and then exited. 元亨 元茂永 exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang and 順利 jointly made over 2,300 contracts, netting over 200. 萬興 jointly made over 1,400 contracts, netting a slight advance. The Guangdong gang and 恒興 sold over 100 contracts but bought few. January's chips totaled 35,560 contracts.</p>
<p>January's contracts: bullish parties included 福昌 with over 5,900 contracts, 萬興 with over 4,900, 恒餘 with over 4,300, 順利 with over 3,300, 乾昌祥 with over 2,500, 兆豐昌 with over 1,700, 元亨 with over 1,500, 瑞興 and 鴻興 with over 1,200 each, 潤昌 and 裕福餘 with over 1,100 each, 永豐大豐恒 and 正昌 with over 800 each. Short parties included 大德成 with over 2,600 contracts, 元茂永 with over 2,400, 惠祥 with over 1,700, 大興永 with over 2,700, 天豐, 丙興, 志豐, 永益成 with over 1,600 each, 大昌祥 with over 1,500, 元春 with over 1,400, 恒泰 and 恒興 四達慶發永 with over 800 each, 宏利 元大永 永豐成 泰豐成 with over 700 each, 生大大成 with over 600 each. In summary, there were 62 short parties and 36 long parties.</p>

<h3>Weekend Silver Dollar Settlement Extremely Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar call loan market situation remained as dull as ever. The prices in both the morning and afternoon markets were still about 8%, with no added interest. All were opened with white markings, and the situation was very loose. However, the internal situation was very tight. The adjustment in general commerce felt particularly strained. Therefore, due to the current situation, most parties cautiously refused to expand the banknote transactions as much as possible.</p>
<p>In the morning market, over 4.3 million was transferred and over 800,000 was newly transacted. In the afternoon market, over 500,000 was transacted, and over 300,000 was transacted in the small general meeting. Transactions of silver dollar mortgage loans were over 890,000. Banknotes were collected over 800,000 and issued over 1.3 million. The customer source was 50,000, and the outflow was 150,000.</p>
<p>On the banking side, yesterday was Saturday, so the afternoon market transactions were done as usual. Therefore, the settlement situation was very calm. Foreign banks collected $1.67 million in settlement bills and over $1.9 million in silver dollars. Various goods, foreign exchange, mortgages, and miscellaneous payments collected $2.78 million in silver and over $3.3 million in silver dollars. Special collections amounted to over $1.3 million. Silver entering the warehouse was 200,000 and silver dollars 300,000.</p>
<p>Chinese banks collected 2.23 million in settlement bills and over 1.78 million in special collection silver dollars.

Qian Zhuang and 洋 companies collected over 4.1 million and over 4.7 million for silver dollar payments. Various interbank remittances amounted to over 400,000. Direct cash collections.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Small Silver Dollars Exceeds 800 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Copper coins shrinking trend is formidable... continued short of 7,000 cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars did not rise or fall. The morning and afternoon markets were both at 845 yuan, the same as the previous afternoon. 11,000 角 transactions in the morning market, 6,500 角 in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars suddenly had a major rising trend. The morning market suddenly rose 4 to 5 yuan to 799 yuan. The afternoon market continued to rise, exceeding the 800 yuan mark, to 800 yuan and 0.05 角, which was as much as 5.9 角 more than the previous day's afternoon market. 135,000 角 transactions in the morning market, 100,500 角 in the afternoon market.</p>
<p>Copper coins also had a very rapid shrinking trend. 5,000 cash shrank the previous day, and another 7,000 cash shrank yesterday, to 290,000 cash. A huge total of 12 to 13,000 cash shrank in the two markets. 34,150 strings were transacted, totaling $11,500 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities: Debt Market Hovering, Various Bonds Have Mixed Rises and Falls, Only 1918 Bonds Plummeted by $1.40</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was slightly hovering. The Zhejiang war clouds, although increasingly dense, are still brewing. The sounds of peace and war are running in parallel, and investor sentiment is slightly confused. Based on Zhang Ji's trip to Guangdong, the path to peace should not be completely cut off. Judging from Guangdong's claims, the central government's use of troops will ultimately be unavoidable. At present, Guangdong's measures are crucial, and the central government's response is also very cautious. The future of the situation depends most on the Fourth Plenary Session. The number of accounts in the exchange is still quite high. How the forces of both sides will develop is currently difficult to predict and should still shift with the environment.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, large investors bought again, and northern gangs continued to cover short positions. Market prices tended to rise sharply, ranging from 35 角 to 1 yuan. In the secondary market, bullish parties sold again, and large investors, such as No. 77, also sold quite a bit. Market prices suddenly fell sharply again by several 角 to over 1 yuan. The rise and fall were uncertain, and it was close to hovering.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, only 编遣裁兵略 was slightly lower by 35 角. After that, it slowly stabilized and trended higher, rebounding 35 角. The market was relatively stable. As a result of the full-day market price, only the unified tax and gold bonds were slightly better by about 1 角. The rest all fell consistently by 35 角 to over 1 yuan. Only the 1918 bonds plummeted by $1.40, which seemed too much. The total volume was 21,123,500 yuan. There were no spot transactions. Futures transactions: unified salt tax totaled 7,175,000, 编遣裁兵 accounted for 3,780,000, 1919 customs bonds totaled 2,550,000, 20-year customs bonds totaled 3,990,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Weakens, Then Firms</h3>
<p>新豐 洋行 reported that on the 8th, the New York stock market initially weakened due to bullish parties taking profits and a lack of buyers. The final trend turned firm. Commercial news was good, and US government bonds were completely subscribed. Therefore, the foundation was solid. US government bonds had mixed ups and downs. Railway freight totaled 495,425 cars. Total stock transactions for the day were 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>(Wheat) News was favorable to bullish parties, and sellers were almost excessively responsive, so a rebound was warranted. (Cotton) Commerce is gradually progressing, so the reduction in working hours at the textile factories is likely a temporary issue. In the long run, prices should be viewed as high. The 金融 善後 社 purchased gold at a price of $34.01 per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks: 101.04 Down 1.00</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks: 41.19 Down 0.34</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks: 23.48 Down 0.02</p>
<p>Forty Bonds: 82.51 Up 0.12</p>
<p>One and Twenty Items: 48.08 Down 0.80</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Bidding Stagnant</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm. As commercial markets are rumored to be organizing numerous buying companies, new sellers are cautious, so selling momentum is reduced. However, actual sales are becoming increasingly sluggish. Inventory is still huge, so new buyers are still lacking. However, the recent decline has been too sharp, and the decline of 17 or 18 yuan may see a temporary rebound. This situation is also expected.</p>
<h3>Man-made Cotton Improves Slightly</h3>
<p>In the forward man-made cotton market, after the opening price increased, the surrounding market still worsened. There were not many new buyers. Each month slightly rose by 2 or 3 角. In the afternoon opening market, bullish parties closed their positions and fell. Closing prices rebounded. As a result, this month rose by 1 yuan, and the far month fell by 2 角. Total trading volume for the day was 18,950 bales. Selling: 大豐 1,300 bales, 源大 700 bales, 賡豐 450 bales, 遠大 1,050 bales, 新華 800 bales, 大昶 450 bales, 恊生 450 bales. Buying: 達記 1,000 bales, 椿記 1,150 bales, 穗隆 1,700 bales, 益昶 1,300 bales, 長豐 1,200 bales, 義成 650 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Man-made Cotton Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>Man-made Cotton Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>December 1738 Up 8 21,850 March 1782 Up 1 25,350</p>
<p>January 1754 Up 5 39,650 April 1793 Down 2 17,800</p>
<p>February 1769 Up 5 36,200 Total 140,800</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales 405 Bales</h3>
<p>Actual yarn sales are still flat. Total sales for the day to various gangs were 405 bales. The market was flat. Sales to various gangs were as follows: Local merchants 37, Xiamen 5, Yunnan 166, Mainland 92, Nanjing 5.</p>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and strong at noon, but the situation was slightly tight. Actual cotton mills needed to be slightly active, and the yarn market was stable, with good investor confidence. Buyers' intentions were getting stronger, and pulling power was particularly strong. However, the latest US cotton estimate showed an increase of 77,000 bales. It is predicted that the true market situation still has the potential to fall. Also, cotton prices are higher than yarn prices, so there is still a lot of selling when prices rise.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Dim and Without Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was sluggish and unremarkable. Traders took a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points and futures prices fell by 4 to 7 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose 4 points, and futures prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 1 point. The Bombay cotton market rose due to buying by speculators and brokers. As a result, Pingruer rose 2 rupees, 奥姆辣 rose 2 rupees and 2.5 角, and 白罗溪 rose 2.5 rupees. The original cable is recorded on the left (8th):</p>

<h3>Grain Factories Selling Near-Term Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of various months generally showed a weak trend. As foreign wheat quotations, Chicago returned less than 58 角, Canada was less than 1 角. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere was depressed. The current month was also sold by large factories, and investor sentiment was softer. To the distant future, such as April and May, there was initially a saying that the tax increase was feasible, and it grew well for a while. However, it soon fell back again, because the current foreign wheat is cheap and declared, and even with the tax increase, it is still in line with the current market.</p>
<p>By the afternoon opening, the market for each month fell another 1 or 2 分, the current month was down to 2.5 角, and April and May were down to around 2.3 to 2.4 角. At that time, there were also transactions in actual foreign wheat, with Argentine wheat as low as 3.95 yuan. Also, brokers traded 3 to 4 thousand tons, 3.85 yuan for bagless red wheat and 3.95 yuan for white wheat, causing investor confidence to be very weak and particularly weak. Later, because of customer support covering short positions, and even more so from Tianjin, the market rebounded. As a result, the current month was down 2 分 2 厘 5, January was down 2 分, February was down 1 分, March and April were down 1.5 分, and the rest was unchanged. The actual wheat market was very quiet, and prices were still stable. Shandong wheat opened at 4.436 yuan, totaling 300 bags.</p>
<h3>The Future Wheat Market is Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month was still stable. Although foreign wheat was quoted less than 1 角 to 58 角, there was still little selling in the market, so the market could still stabilize. By the afternoon opening, because the flour market had fallen, and because of the cheap sales of actual foreign wheat, investor confidence was very weak. Also, industry brokers rumored that they had ordered 2 to 3 thousand tons of red wheat at a price of only 3.85 yuan, and they intended to sell short to the distant future. Therefore, the market conditions in each month fell step by step, and the transactions were also unusually prosperous. As a result, the current month fell 6 分, January fell 8 分, February and March fell 7 分, and the rest was unchanged. The actual wheat market was very quiet, and prices were still stable. Shandong wheat opened at 4.436 yuan, totaling 300 bags.</p>
<h3>Steep Decline in Both Thick and Thin Rice Prices</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Supply surged suddenly, with over 80 boats arriving (over 10,000 *shi*). Late-season rice accounted for slightly more than one-third, with over 30 boats. Merchants were hesitant to buy due to the lower prices in other markets, leading to suspension of operations in Tianjin and other regions. Only Qingdao and Yantai were still active. As a result, buyers insisted on lower prices, while sellers were reluctant to sell at a loss, given the limited daily arrivals. After several discussions into the afternoon, prices were lowered significantly before about 20 boats, approximately 3,000+ bags, were sold. The market for *hou geng* (thick *japonica* rice) from Changshu, Suzhou, and Nangang saw increased demand, but the overwhelming supply led to oversupply and sluggish market conditions, with prices falling by approximately 20 cents. *She yang jian* rice remained stable due to limited supply and strong demand. *Yin yuan* rice remained unchanged. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, 50+ boats arrived from various routes downstream. Demand improved slightly for all types of goods on the market. High-quality *bai geng* (white *japonica* rice) prices remained firm, while medium to low grades weakened slightly. *Bai yuan*, *yin yuan*, *yang du*, and *bu xian* prices saw minor increases. Early and thin rice, as well as *ke xian* and *po geng* rice, remained stable.</p>
<h3>Lack of Wholesale Outlets for *Ke Xian* Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday's *ke xian* (traveler's *indica* rice) market saw continued buying from local merchants, keeping prices firm. However, inventory levels remained high, and supplies continued to arrive. There was a lack of wholesale export channels, and even transactions among hoarders were less active than before. Only the Fuzhou market showed some activity, with nearly 1,000 bags sold yesterday. It is said that although rice inventory in Fuzhou is low, prices are weak due to tight credit conditions, hindering sales in Fuzhou. Some believe that with the increased tariffs on foreign rice, supply will be cut off, and *ke xian* from the Yangtze River region will continue to be shipped directly to Guangdong. Due to the high production costs, it is not economical to ship to Shanghai. If demand for *ke xian* in Shanghai increases further, prices are expected to rise. Yesterday, 700 bags of late-season machine-milled rice from Jiangxi were shipped out, along with 190 bags of *yuan mi* (unpolished rice) from Wuhu to Ningbo, 500 bags of unpolished rice from Hunan to Fuzhou, 370 bags of coarse rice to Beijing, and 150 bags of machine-milled rice from Jiangbei. Prices were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Resurgence of Soybean Cake Price Inflation</h3>
<p>Due to seasonal factors, soybean cake trading has been quiet for a long time. Recently, villagers in the interior saw prices drop to around $1.10 (referring to Sanpai brand cakes) and began buying in large quantities. Traders and exporters (Wenzhou and South China) also started paying attention. Therefore, the long-dormant soybean cake market has seen a resurgence of inflationary pressures. Yesterday, over 15,000 pieces of Sanpai brand cakes from various factories were traded, and prices rose by 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Another 1,000+ Boxes of *Pian Qing* Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight improvement in customs gold, leading to a price increase. The guild set the price for ordinary coarse granulated white sugar at $19.90, up 10 cents from the previous day. Prices for Hechi sugar grades 8 and 9 remained unchanged and lacked transactions. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was offered at $20.02, an increase of 10 cents, but no sales occurred. Chen Kee No. 1 fine white sugar saw some transactions at $18.80, with the remaining accounts being refunded. Another large batch of over 1,000 boxes of *pian qing* sugar was opened, including 500 boxes by Yuanxing Company and over 500 boxes by Guangdong companies. Prices were all $10 for cash, with strong sales to the north, leading to a slight improvement in offered prices. Future market trends will depend on the supply volume.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Raw Silk Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>(Tussah silk for American sales still needed) Tussah silk for American sales has been almost entirely taken over by Japanese silk. Shanghai's American trading houses have long ceased buying tussah silk, leading to a halt in shipments to America. Only 40 bales were shipped to British and French territories last week.</p>
<p>(Difficult Progress in European and American Silk Sales) Although overseas silk prices have rebounded in New York, silk for use in Lyon factories continues to decline. Telegraphic prices are still $200-$300 below the factories' cost. Chinese silk merchants are currently petitioning the government for relief and are unwilling to sell at a loss. European and American trading houses tend to take advantage of low prices to cover their short positions, but Chinese merchants insist that silk sales remain difficult to progress. Yesterday, Qianli imported 20 bales of white factory silk, and Zhonghe imported 30 bales of gray silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3>Slight Sales of *Zhen Mei* and *Zhu Cha* Tea</h3>
<p>The local foreign trading houses' tea market has become increasingly quiet in recent days. European trading houses have ample inventory from Morocco and sluggish sales. Without firm orders from overseas, they are reluctant to hoard goods and are adopting a wait-and-see approach. Yesterday, only Tongfu, Fushi, and Huacha and other companies bought a total of 119 boxes of green tea, including *xia mu*, *ma zhu*, and *zhen mei* tea, with little change in prices.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Esperanto Studies: Mr. Wu Zhihui says: All enlightened people in the world have a responsibility to promote Esperanto.</p>
<h3>A Casual Smile from Ye Yu: Esperanto, Esperanto, and World Affairs</h3>
<p>— Li Xi</p>
<p>Following ("Special Issue on Esperanto Studies (Part 1)"), the editors of this publication raised a question: (How can those who have learned Esperanto be given ample opportunities to practice, so as to avoid becoming rusty and eventually completely forgetting it?) This is indeed a practical and very important question. Many Esperantists, after enthusiastically completing the initial lessons, that is, after having acquired a basic foundation, naturally become unfamiliar with Esperanto, to the point of completely forgetting it. The reasons for this are no more than two: unstable living conditions and too few opportunities to come into contact with Esperanto.</p>
<p>So, at present, how can we prevent those who have learned Esperanto from becoming rusty and forgetting it? I believe that: (1) It is necessary to have frequent contact; (2) Subscribe to several periodicals on a regular basis (preferably at least two, one domestic and one foreign); (3) Communicate regularly with Esperantists across the country and around the world; (4) At the very least, do not leave the Esperanto movement; (5) Practice writing and translating a lot.</p>
<p>Whether learning a foreign language or learning a skill, frequent contact is an important method of training. For example, when making friends, meeting face-to-face, arguing, feelings will naturally grow thicker. Regarding the method of frequent contact, abroad, there are Esperanto clubs, night talks, Sunday forums, and other gatherings that can be attended in almost every place, but in China, due to various reasons, I am afraid that there will be none besides Shanghai. Therefore, we can only read a book repeatedly. Reading thoroughly is very beneficial for both beginners and those who have already learned Esperanto. However, always being in contact with a few books will undoubtedly become tedious. So, it is necessary to subscribe to several publications. Fortunately, there are now magazines of various types in Esperanto, and you can subscribe to a few that you like. The language of magazines is often the most fashionable, popular, and interesting, so there will definitely be no feeling of dryness or boredom. To put it cliché: gain essence from books, seek breadth from magazines.</p>
<p>However, simply burying oneself in reading is not enough, and may even lead to boredom in the long run. We must use it practically. The first step in practical application is to speak more, but speaking requires at least two people, so we need to communicate more. Communication can help us improve our writing skills, which is known to everyone. Generally, those who have completed the Esperanto grammar (at most six months can be spent learning it) are able to communicate. In addition, Esperantists all over the world are almost all enthusiastic and clear-headed people, so communication becomes more cordial, and one feels an supreme gift from Esperanto.</p>
<p>At this point, the beginner has reached a considerable stage. However, many Esperantists gradually become estranged from Esperanto from this stage. They either leave the Esperanto movement due to their environment or because they have already achieved a certain amount of success, and they walk alone on the desolate road ahead. Before long, they will become more and more estranged and increasingly forgetful. Therefore, after Esperantists have reached a certain level, even if they cannot place themselves in the Esperanto movement, they should at least not leave the Esperanto movement! This is an important juncture! Because the Esperanto movement enables you to constantly increase new knowledge and new skills, so that you not only use Esperanto practically but also increase all aspects of Esperanto! How can there be estrangement and forgetting then?</p>
<p>However, in fact, some Esperantists have absolute patience and may be willing to walk alone on the desolate road ahead. Most of these people are literati. Their purpose is to learn Esperanto to help their literary work. They can patiently and diligently read many Esperanto works and translate diligently. They are indifferent to the Esperanto movement, but precisely because of this, although these Esperantists will not forget like ordinary people, they are generally good at writing and reading, but not good at listening and speaking. This is also a shortcoming. Therefore, now I repeat: in any case, all Esperantists should not leave the Esperanto movement! Every Esperantist must promote the Esperanto movement, and only through broad movement can we have sufficient, natural, and easily encountered learning opportunities! Only in this way can our language be used practically and expanded and deepened!</p>
<p>Esperanto Knowledge</p>
<h3>What Prospective Esperanto Learners Should Know</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jiangang</p>
<p>▲How Long Does It Take to Learn?▲</p>
<p>We know that Esperanto is very easy to learn, but how long does it actually take to learn it? This is a question that people who want to learn or have already started learning Esperanto often ask. Those who promote Esperanto often say that it can be learned in three or six months, while the great writer Tolstoy only took two hours to learn it. Is Esperanto really that easy?</p>
<p>Yes, Esperanto is very easy. But the so-called (learn) has two stages: one stage is (understand), which is to be able to understand everything in the textbook, and the second stage is (know), which is to be able to speak, listen, write, and read Esperanto with ease and without difficulty. The ordinary saying (learn) refers only to the (understand) stage. I think ordinary people can complete the first (understand) stage in just three or four months, at most only six months. If you have studied a foreign language (English, French, German...), it will be easier. People who have reached the (understand) level, although not yet fully (know), can at least speak or write simple sentences and read simple materials, such as (Esperanto Living Leaf Selections) and so on. As for the completion of the second stage (know), it depends on whether the learner uses it practically at all times. If you speak, communicate, and read books all the time, then the completion will naturally be faster. However, so-called learning has no end, and (learn) has no definite standard, so it is difficult to determine how long it will take. However, people who work hard will have good results after four or five months of effort after (understanding).</p>
<p>▲Can I Learn If I Don't Know a Foreign Language?▲</p>
<p>People who want to learn Esperanto often ask: I haven't studied English, can I learn Esperanto? Some people don't even dare to think about learning Esperanto because they haven't studied English. Naturally, it is more convenient to learn if you have studied English or French, but sometimes there are also disadvantages. For example, the word "Capital" in English has meanings such as (capital city) and (capital). For the word kapitalo in Esperanto, people who have learned English can understand it at a glance, which is an advantage. But it is a big mistake to think that Kapitalo also has the meaning of (capital city), because this word in Esperanto only means (capital). This is a disadvantage. Therefore, people who have not studied English should not be afraid, thinking that it is impossible to learn Esperanto.</p>
<p>▲How to Start Learning?▲</p>
<p>The previous issue of this publication had an article ("Esperanto Learning Methods During the Textbook Period"), which can be used as a reference for readers. Here, I will only talk about smaller but more concrete issues. There are three methods of learning, namely: (1) face-to-face teaching, (2) correspondence courses, and (3) self-study.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the first type. There are not many Esperanto schools that offer face-to-face teaching now. Currently, only the Shanghai Esperanto Association, located at No. 12, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, Shanghai, has a training class, divided into elementary and intermediate classes. Those who have not yet learned can enter the elementary class. Classes start on December 11th, and you can still register today and tomorrow. The duration is three months, the tuition fee is two yuan, and the time is from 7 pm to 9 pm every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The teacher is a Hungarian who has been an Esperantist for more than ten years.</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Let's talk about the second type, correspondence courses. There are two correspondence schools in Shanghai: one is the (China Esperanto Correspondence School) run by the Shanghai Esperanto Association, located at Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. Graduates in six months and you can join at any time. The tuition fee is five yuan. The other is the correspondence school run by the Shanghai Esperanto Society, with the mailing address Shanghai P.O. Box 2332. Graduates in six months, the tuition fee is eight yuan. Those who wish to enroll can ask for a brochure first. Regarding the third type, self-study, you can buy (Esperanto Full Course) or (Esperanto Shortcut). The former is published by Kaiming Bookstore, and the latter is sold on consignment by the (China Esperanto Bookstore) run by the Shanghai Esperanto Association, with a real price of one yuan and ten cents. The store is also located at No. 12, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. (The store also has other Esperanto books from various countries, not less than several hundred types).</p>
<h3>International Esperanto Movement: The Esperanto Movement in Japan</h3>
<p>— Su Shenqi</p>
<p>The Esperanto movement in Japan is comparable to that in the Soviet Union and Germany. Especially in recent years, the rise of the progressive Esperanto movement in Japan, as well as research in the area of Esperanto grammar, are unmatched by other countries. The early Esperanto movement was centered on Europe, but the development of Esperanto requires the collective cooperation of Orientals. Therefore, the progress of the Oriental Japanese world movement guarantees the bright future of the world movement throughout the world, which is of great significance.</p>
<p>The introduction of Esperanto to Japan was between 1905 and 1906, almost at the same time as China. In June 1906, the (Japan Esperanto Association) was founded, and its cadres included the radical thinkers of the time, Rong Doushan, Sakai Lihiko, and Jun Yamakawa. Katayama Sen, who recently passed away in Moscow, is said to have learned Esperanto during this period. In addition to teaching at the (Esperanto School), Rong Doushan also opened a class for Chinese students studying in Japan, such as Liu Shenshu and Zhang Puquan. This budding period of the Japanese world movement lasted only four or five years. What followed was a dark period: military expansion, the annexation of Korea (1910), militarism was rampant for a time, and the association fell into a state of stagnation. The association's publication (Japanese Esperantist) also stopped publication due to financial difficulties. It was not until the outbreak of World War I that Japanese capitalism made unprecedented progress, and the New Culture Movement, the Mass Art Movement, and the Labor Movement gradually emerged. As a result, the Esperanto movement gained new strength and began to revive. Generally, young people and intellectuals who yearn for a beautiful future and cherish idealism resonate with Zamenhof's ideals and devote themselves to this movement, and the momentum is unusually strong. The new literary magazine of the time, (Sower), also published an Esperanto declaration in its inaugural issue. The intensification of social opposition also formed a gradual separation of the left and right wings in the Esperanto movement. At the 12th Japan Esperanto Congress in 1924, a SAT subcommittee (group) meeting was held. In 1927, the Esperantist Akita Ujak attended the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution at the invitation of the Soviet Union. During his stay in Russia, Akita drove Esperanto around, giving lectures and broadcasting everywhere. After returning to China, Akita became the director of the International Culture Research Institute, and the publication (International Culture) also carried Esperanto texts. In 1930, the International Culture Research Institute was reorganized into the Proletarian Science Research Institute. The institute had an Esperanto Research Association, and its publication (Proletarian Science) also opened an Esperanto column and compiled (Proletarian Esperanto Lectures) in six volumes and held Esperanto training classes every year. In 1931, with the Esperanto Research Association of the Proletarian Science Research Institute as the center, the (Japan Proletarian Esperanto League) was founded, becoming a wing of the Japanese left-wing cultural movement.</p>
<p>The above is the historical development of the Esperanto movement in Japan. Now, let's describe the existing Esperanto organizations in Japan in sections:</p>
<p>Japan Esperanto Society (JEL) (Japan Esperanto Association) After the Japan Esperanto Association stagnated, it was founded in 1919 by a group centered on the young idealist Kobayashi Changji. It is the official central organ of the Japanese neutral Esperanto movement. It has more than 2,000 members, and its fund has more than 15,000 yuan (Japanese currency). Last year, it built its own clubhouse (office and classroom) in Hongo Ward, Tokyo. In addition to publishing the organ magazine (Oriental Review) and the monthly (Esperanto Learner), it also publishes and sells Esperanto books. The address of the association is (Motomachi, Hongo Ward, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>In recent years, the Japan Esperanto Society, which claims to be neutral, has lost the idealistic enthusiasm of its founding. Last year, the cadres of the association, such as Kobayashi Changji, even listed their names on the (Manchukuo Petition) (congratulating the birth of (Manchukuo) and requesting the use of Esperanto), which has exposed the true nature of the so-called neutralists. Esperanto Promotion Association (EPA) A religious organization that promotes the religious nature of Esperanto from the standpoint of Omoto (a Japanese religion that likes to alarm people with prophecies). The association has about 2,000 members, and its organ magazine is (Green World). After (128), the association published a book (Manchurian Incident and Shanghai Conflict), which tried its best to cover up and distort the truth of Japanese imperialist armed aggression against China, and promoted it internationally. The Promotion Association often sends people to various places (even Korea, Taiwan, and Manchuria) to promote Esperanto, give lectures, hold classes, and organize groups. Because it is supported by Omoto behind it, it does not have economic or other difficulties. It even publishes an international monthly (International Omoto) in the name of (Omoto Headquarters). However, due to its blatant tendency towards aggression, it is dissatisfied with the righteous Esperantists of various countries. However, its power in Japan cannot be underestimated. The address of the association is (Kameoka Town, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan).</p>
<p>Japan Proletarian Esperanto League (JPEU) The Japanese left-wing Esperanto organization, the Japanese branch of IPE, was established in 1931. Their program is: (1) To promote, popularize, and use Esperanto from the standpoint of the proletariat, (2) To oppose the Esperanto movement of the bourgeoisie, (3) To cooperate in the construction of the development and theory of Esperanto, (4) To unify the Proletarian Esperanto movement in Japan and its colonies, (5) To expand and strengthen the International Proletarian Esperanto movement. In addition to publishing the organ magazine (JPEU) and the monthly magazine (Comrade), it also sells left-wing Esperanto books and newspapers from various countries. The books published by UPEU (which was then affiliated to the Proletarian Science Research Institute) include (Proletarian Esperanto Lectures) in six volumes, (The First Textbook), and (May Day), etc. In the past two years, the power of the League has penetrated into factories and rural areas throughout the country, and the work of Esperanto communication (PEK) is also well-known internationally.</p>
<p>Japan Esperanto Society (JEA) It is an organization organized by Japanese Esperantists Kaji Hirokazu et al., also known as (Esperanto Research Society), which is purely a research and publishing organization. The magazine is (Esperantist), a bimonthly magazine, which is exquisitely printed, and all the articles are in Esperanto. In addition, it also publishes Esperanto translations such as (Infanticide 1) by Hon Yu San, (Father Returns) by Kikuta, and (War in the Far East) by Radick. The address is (No. 83, Sanbancho, Kojimachi Ward, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>The above four groups are the most important Esperanto groups in Japan. In addition, there are also specialized groups such as (Japan Esperanto Student Federation), (Japan Railway Esperanto Federation), (Japan Buddhist Esperanto Federation), (Japan Esperanto Literature Research Association), and FRONTTO Company, which publishes (International Language Research) (bimonthly). I will only mention these here and not go into detail.</p>
<h3>Esperanto Essays: Esperanto and the National Question</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wen Yici</p>
<p>Language develops with the development of the economic structure of society. In the era of natural economy, the form of language is dialect. Entering the era of capitalism, it forms a national language. Now it is the transitional period when human society is entering the (Datong World) as Mr. Sun Yat-sen said. All aspects of social life are becoming increasingly internationalized, and Esperanto, which is suitable for this transitional period as a language for international communication, is (Esperanto).</p>
<p>Although we translate Esperanto as (World Language), the current form of (Esperanto) is not the language that will be commonly used in the future Datong World. We are not prophets, so we have no way of knowing the details of how the living form of human beings in the future world will become. Similarly, we cannot know the cultural and linguistic forms of the future world. However, based on the various tendencies that we already know, it is not difficult to imagine that in the future Datong World, because of the high development of social economy, there will definitely be no division of classes, and various different ethnic groups will also be dissolved and merged into a collective of all mankind. Similarly, in this future world, various different national cultures and national languages will also be dissolved and form a single culture and language of all mankind.</p>
<p>The various ethnic groups in the world today are not all equal and free to develop. Weak ethnic groups are under the imperialist invasion and domination, becoming its colonies and semi-colonies. A country often contains several minority ethnic groups. These weak ethnic groups have lost their political and economic independence and the freedom to fully develop their culture and language. They are all of low cultural standards, and some even have no writing, only oral languages; under the rule of plunderers, they are making sacrifices. This is the most unreasonable world that Mr. Sun Yat-sen believes.</p>
<p>It will not be until the unequal system is transformed that the colonies and semi-colonies can completely break away from the political and economic ties of imperialism; and after the new social relations of a country are established, the minority ethnic groups in the country can truly obtain self-determination. In this way, the various ethnic groups in the world can stand on a line and fully and freely develop their culture and language.</p>
<p>The free development of various ethnic groups after gaining independence has made human life widely and rapidly internationalized. As a result, the national barriers between human beings will inevitably collapse. At the same time, the cultures and languages of various ethnic groups will also be developed on an unprecedented scale and will be rapidly internationalized. (Esperanto), which develops in parallel with the languages of various ethnic groups, will continue to absorb all the internationalized elements of the languages of various ethnic groups, and will be more enriched, and will be applied by various ethnic groups more widely than the current (Esperanto). Undoubtedly, the (Esperanto) of that era will eventually form the only language of the entire human group, although it is still only an embryo at present.</p>
<p>Therefore, (Esperanto) does not contradict the development of national languages. Not only that, only when various ethnic groups (including the languages of colonial and semi-colonial ethnic groups and minority ethnic groups) freely develop can (Esperanto) be more internationalized in terms of content and form. Only the freedom and equality of various ethnic groups can realize the world of Datong. Similarly, only the free development of the languages of various ethnic groups can form the only language of the world of Datong. This (separation for the sake of unification) is precisely the dialectic of language evolution.</p>

<h3>The Esperanto Movement in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Ms. Wu Mo'an</p>
<p>Russia was originally the cradle of Esperanto. Zamenhof's (First Book) was first published in Russian. In 1889, 80% of Esperanto speakers lived in Russia. They deeply sympathized with Zamenhof's ideal of human love and enthusiastically supported Esperanto.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>At the Third All-Soviet Esperanto Congress in 1921, the establishment of the (Soviet Esperanto Union) (SEU) was announced. However, at that time, the political and economic situation was not yet stable, so the public had not yet paid attention to Esperanto. It was not until 1925 that the situation improved. That year, the Soviet authorities announced the necessity of leading the international education of workers. The Soviet Esperanto speakers then presented their language to the public as a tool for international education.</p>
<p>After this, with the increasing consolidation of the Soviet regime and the close attention of workers from various countries to the development of the Soviet Union, international cultural and educational work became increasingly important. As a result, Esperanto was increasingly valued and maintained by the Soviet party and government authorities, trade unions, and all public organizations. They not only helped the Esperanto movement in terms of guidance and organization, but also provided as much material assistance as possible. Many trade unions provided Esperanto organizations with offices and subsidies. For example, the Moscow Trade Union Federation provided the Moscow Committee of the Soviet Esperanto Union with a meeting place and subsidized it with 8,000 rubles annually. Many organizations paid salaries to Esperanto speakers to teach or to work in international correspondence.</p>
<p>Esperanto is regarded as a useful tool for international communication in the Soviet Union, so international correspondence among workers, students, office workers, and even children is very popular. In their correspondence, they often report on the success of the Five-Year Plan, the living conditions of the masses, and answer questions from Esperanto speakers abroad. They take the letters sent by Esperanto speakers abroad to read aloud at mass gatherings, and even broadcast them on radio stations. Soviet newspapers publish many, many letters from Esperanto speakers. The most famous are MajakKommuni in Crimea, Rabselkor (Workers' Correspondent) in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and (Pravda) in Arkhangelsk in the north. The editorial departments of these newspapers often contact Esperanto speakers from various countries in Esperanto and ask them to be their correspondents. Other newspapers, such as those of Moscow, Leningrad, major factories, the Red Army, the Young Pioneers, and the wall newspapers of collective farms, also regularly publish Esperanto correspondence.</p>
<p>Broadcasting news about the Soviet Union to the world in Esperanto is also one of the tasks of Soviet Esperanto speakers. Minsk Radio broadcasts in Esperanto three times a week; the Moscow Stalin Grand Radio Station (wavelength 425 meters) broadcasts in Esperanto every month on the 8th, 18th, and 28th at 9:00 to 9:30 pm Moscow time, reporting on the progress of socialist construction; and the Donbas Stalin Regional Communist Youth League broadcasts in Esperanto on the 15th and 25th of each month from 7:00 to 7:30 pm Moscow time, broadcasting about the lives and activities of Soviet children, children's literature, and children's songs, wavelength 385 meters. In addition, Kharkov Radio also has regular Esperanto broadcasts.</p>
<p>Among the public organizations in the Soviet Union, the (League of Militant Atheists) is the most active in Esperanto. In addition to translating many anti-religious documents into Esperanto, this anti-religious organization also regularly publishes a publication, formerly called (The Militant Atheist), now changed to (Anti-Religionist). The second most active is the education sector. In Ukraine, the Esperanto educational publication (The Path of Education) is regularly published, and there is news that the (Soviet Education Magazine), which was previously published, will resume publication after the All-Soviet Congress of Educational Workers in July of this year. The Congress also decided to use Esperanto as the language of international communication in the education sector to exchange educational experiences, and decided to set up Esperanto classes in educators' clubs in various places, establish Esperanto libraries, and open Esperanto correspondence schools. In the field of sports, all the slogans for the World Workers' Games to be held in Moscow next year have also been decided to be in Esperanto.</p>
<p>Finally, I must say something about the situation of the Soviet Esperanto Union. It is the largest organization of Esperanto organizations in the world, and each republic and city in the Soviet Union has its own committee and group. In terms of publishing, the Soviet Esperanto Union has three periodicals: (International Language) monthly, (On the Front Lines) bi-monthly, and (The Truth of the Soviet Union). The plan to translate the collected works of Lenin (a total of sixteen volumes) into Esperanto is also being carried out collectively under the supervision of the Union.</p>
<p>Esperanto Speaker's Self-Description</p>
<h3>From Paris to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Esperanto original by Mr. Yuzhi, translated by Ms. Shen Shulan</p>
<p>Last January, when I returned to Shanghai from Paris, I visited Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. In Cologne, Dortmund, Hanover, Leipzig, and Warsaw, I stayed for a day or two, and in Berlin and Moscow I stayed for a week each. Time was very limited, and I did not understand the languages of these countries, but with Esperanto, I finally traveled</p>

<h3>The Origin of the Name "(Esperanto)"</h3>
<p>When Zamenhof published (First Book) in 1887, he did not use his real name, but used the pseudonym D｜roEsperanto (Doctor Hopeful). He himself did not give a fixed name to his language, but called it LingvoInternacia (International Language). At first, to distinguish it from other international languages, it was called "(Doctor Hopeful's) International Language". Later, for convenience, people used the name (Esperanto) as the name of this language, and it has been used as a fixed and exclusive name for this language ever since. At the beginning of the 20th century, Esperanto was introduced to Japan, where it was translated as (世界語 - Sekaigo) and the Chinese also used this translation. This is the origin of the name "(世界語 - Esperanto)".</p>
<h3>(The Three Principles of the People) Also Has a World Translation - A General View of the Esperanto Publishing World</h3>
<p>— Lou Yifan</p>
<p>How many books are there in Esperanto? This is a very interesting question. Now I will just talk about a very small part that I personally know. As for what I don't know, there may be tens of thousands of kinds!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Esperanto translations of famous works of world literature.</p>

The fairy tale (The Picture Book Without Pictures) by the Japanese writer Hayashi Fusao has also recently been translated into Esperanto.</p>
<p>The above refers only to translated literature. In terms of Esperanto original works, we can mention Vallesiner, Lewinsky, Forkel, Juribaqi, Liu Ping, Kozmitsch, Vlamer, Boldus, Walranjin, Izgur, Mihalski, and the outstanding Japanese writer Ii Uu.</p>
<p>The characteristic of Esperanto translated literature is that it not only includes the masterpieces of advanced countries, but also the works of various small and weak nations, such as the small European nations Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, Hungary, and the Eastern countries Korea, Taiwan, and India, which are particularly numerous in Esperanto. Secondly, let's talk about social sciences:</p>
<p>SAT has published (The Iron Heel), (Esperanto Grand Dictionary), (Ethics) (Kropotkin), (State and Revolution), (Marx's Works and Life), etc. OEKRELO has published even more, including: (The 133 Days of the Hungarian Revolution), (The October Revolution and its Tactics), (The October Revolution and Religion), (Religious Morality and Emerging Morality), (Marx's Teachings), (The Achievements of the Five-Year Plan), (Litvinov's Speech at the Disarmament Conference), (Soviet Education of Homeless Children), (The Implementation of the First Five-Year Plan), (The Implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan), (The Year of Decision), (The Enslavement of Capitalism and the Socialist Organization of Labor), (National Culture and International Culture), (Modern Social Democratic Party, Religion and Atheism), (The Pace of the Five-Year Plan), (The Preparers of War), (The Truth About Soviet Anti-Religion), (The Country of Hindenburg), (An Eight-Week Trip to the Soviet Union), etc. And Sun Yat-sen's (Three Principles of the People) and (Five-Power Constitution) have also been partially translated into Esperanto.</p>

<p>these cities, and without any difficulty. I was able to learn about life there, especially the life of the workers. A month's journey gave me more knowledge than three years of study at university. It is impossible to describe everything I saw and heard during the trip. Now I will only talk about some of the noteworthy impressions these cities gave me. Before this, I had lived in Europe for three years and had become familiar with Esperanto life. According to my experience, all Esperanto speakers are kind people. However, no matter where or when, I had never encountered the enthusiasm I encountered on this trip. Everywhere people welcomed me as a guest of honor, and male and female comrades treated me like their own brothers and sisters. Day and night, people helped me, guided me, invited me to their homes, and fulfilled all my requests. On several occasions, people respected me so much that it made me a little embarrassed. During this trip, I regained a belief that the workers' Esperanto movement plays a major role in our movement. First, from an organizational point of view. The workers' Esperanto movement after the Great War is becoming increasingly active, and has now surpassed the neutral movement of the bourgeoisie. The organization and number of members of the workers' Esperanto speakers is stronger than those of the neutral organizations. In Germany and Poland, workers' Esperanto groups are more active and better organized than those neutral groups. In the Soviet Union, the Soviet Esperanto Union is also a workers' organization, and is considered the largest among the groups in the world. In my experience, only workers truly need an international language, and only they can fight for Esperanto until the final victory. Second, from a spiritual point of view. After the Great War, the so-called (internal ideal) and the so-called (Esperantism) had died, or almost died, but now it has been reborn from the workers' movement. The solidarity and internationalism of the workers gave Esperanto new strength and saved it from spiritual collapse. My contact with Esperanto speakers of all countries and classes confirmed this view. In Western Europe, I met many so-called neutral Esperanto speakers. Only a few very old comrades, Zamenhof's contemporaries, were sincere, but unfortunately they were too old, too idealistic, and completely unsuitable for the current situation, so they could not do anything for our movement. Others learn Esperanto only for exploitation. They use Esperanto for entertainment, for curiosity, or for profit. They no longer want to dedicate themselves to the Esperanto movement. I met bourgeois neutral Esperanto speakers who often asked me: (Do Chinese people eat dogs?) (How many wives do you have?) etc. They thought they were talking to a barbarian. Esperanto did not change their nationalistic prejudices. These noble gentlemen called me (comrade), which was really a joke, because in fact we had nothing (in common). Workers use Esperanto for the purpose of their struggle, not for personal gain. They are fanatical propagandists and materialistic thinkers. They learn and promote Esperanto on the basis of realistic consciousness. They have no motherland, so all national prejudices do not exist among them. When I was among the workers' Esperanto speakers, I felt that I was really living in (Esperanto Land), and I was surrounded by family. Many comrades I met in Germany and Poland dedicated all their time and meager property to our movement. This is no longer possible in the neutral Esperanto movement. Germans are the best organizers in the world. The German Esperanto movement is also better organized than in other countries. Everywhere I visited, everything was very orderly. Many people always participate in the gatherings. The workers' Esperanto movement in Berlin is organized by groups. In many factories, trade unions, and schools, there are Esperanto groups that recruit members, promote, and teach Esperanto among workers. I only stayed in Warsaw for one day, but I met many Esperanto speakers. The comrades here also suffered greatly from unemployment. They enthusiastically welcomed me at the station and led me to visit Zamenhof's grave. From noon to night, I attended and spoke at five gatherings, two were workers' gatherings, two were students', and one was from the neutral side. I was deeply moved at a gathering called (Labor), where four hundred male and female workers listened to my report on the Workers' Esperanto Congress and the situation in China. Unfortunately, time was limited. But they wouldn't let me go. It was difficult for me to get out of this meeting place. This time I was very tired, but also very happy. After a day's journey, I arrived in Moscow the next morning. Many male and female comrades were waiting for me at the station. My passport only allowed me to transit through the Soviet Union, not to stay. But thanks to the efforts of the Moscow Esperanto speakers, I was able to stay in Moscow for a week. I visited factories, schools, nurseries, public canteens, workers' residences, hospitals, the Winter Palace, Lenin's Mausoleum, theaters, local Soviet offices... etc. It would take a book to report everything I saw and heard in a week. On February 3rd, I left Moscow, and eight days later, I returned to China again.</p>
<h3>International Esperanto Organizations - The Four International Organizations of the World Movement</h3>
<p>— Gong Hongfei</p>
<p>The international organizations of the World Movement are the central organs that lead and unify the Esperanto movement around the world. The first to be established was the Universal Esperanto Association. However, as a result of the development of the movement, various different tendencies inevitably emerged, and these different tendencies formed several separate international organizations in the movement. Now, let's describe these international organizations separately, in order of their establishment. (1) Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) The Universal Esperanto Association (UEA for short), established in 1908, was originally a private organization, and only became a formal international organization in 1922. Its organization is based on individual members, so it has no relationship with the groups in various countries in terms of organizational system. However, since this year's Cologne Congress, it has been changed to be based on the group members of various countries. According to the new decision this year, any national group with more than one hundred members can join AEEU. However, individuals from countries without a national group (such as China) can also join. In addition to holding a Universal Esperanto Congress once a year and publishing a yearbook and a journal (Esperanto), UEA does not seem to have any other movements to speak of. The Shanghai agent of UEA is Mr. Chen Zhaoying, located at No. K7, Penglu. Those who wish to join can contact Mr. Chen. (2) World Anational Association (SAT) SAT is an international organization of the left wing of Esperanto speakers. UEA adopts a so-called (neutral) attitude towards everything. Although SAT is said to be a left-wing group, it also maintains neutrality on the factions of political parties, so SAT members include all parties, as well as non-party members. It was established in 1921, reorganized from (Star of Liberation). Its organization is similar to UEA, and it is also based on individual members. The association once published the monthly (Anational Review) (once renamed (New Era)) and the weekly (Anationalist). In 1929, the number of members reached 7,000, and it was about to surpass UEA. Since its establishment, the association has also held a world congress every year (this year is the thirteenth time in Stockholm) and published a yearbook, forming a confrontational situation with UEA. However, in recent years, because the leading members have expressed right-leaning attitudes and their advocated anationalism (negating all struggles for national independence), it has caused the split of left-wing members in Germany, the Soviet Union, and other countries. The number of members has been greatly reduced. On the one hand, the money remaining in the Soviet Union could not be withdrawn, which was a very big blow. This year, some of the social democrats were also dissatisfied with its organizational form and formed a new group on their own, and its power was further weakened. Now (Anationalist) and (Anational Review) have both become monthly publications. The former has eight pages per issue, and the latter has sixteen pages. The association has no agent in China, and its management department is in Leipzig, Germany, but it is feared that it has been moved. Its leaders are at 23, rue Boyer, Paris XX. (3) Proletarian Esperantists International (IPE) This international was organized by those who split from the left wing of SAT. It was established in 1932. Its mission is to use Esperanto practically in the global laboring class liberation movement and socialist construction, to unite and lead various proletarian Esperanto groups, and to promote the theory, technology, and application of international artificial languages. And it is based on revolutionary struggle, dialectical materialism, and proletarian internationalism. The international also welcomes proletarian Esperanto speakers of all parties and does not limit itself to one party or faction. The organizational form of this international is completely different from the former UEA and SAT. It is based on the country as a unit. Individuals can only join directly in countries that do not have a national organization. When it was established, it had members in eighteen countries, totaling 13,000 people. Its journals are (Internationalist) bi-monthly and bi-monthly (New Stage). Its affiliated publishing house, Ekrelo, although established not long ago, has published many books, including major works such as (History of the World Common Language) and (Analytical History of the Esperanto Movement). In addition, there are also books on proletarian literature and art, poetry, novels, scripts, as well as scientific books about the two Five-Year Plans of the Soviet Union. In addition to publishing and organizing, it also launched the (International Correspondence Movement) (PCK), establishing a solid and practical foundation. The central organ of this international was originally in Berlin. It was closed down due to Hitler's repression. Publications were banned, and the publishing house was also confiscated. However, it has recently been moved to Amsterdam Z. Ferdinand Bolstraat 14, k|do Visser o in the Netherlands. Its publication (Internationalist) was renamed Sur Posteno, and recently it has also been published as usual with (New Stage). (4) Socialist Esperantists International (ISE) Since SAT split, most of its members have been social democrats. Some of this faction were dissatisfied with its organizational form and advocated using an international form. They then split again and organized a new international of purely social democrats. The biggest supporters of this international are the Esperanto groups of social democrats in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, France, and other countries. However, the workers' Esperanto groups in the Netherlands and Sweden, which are also social democrats, opposed the creation of this new international and advocated maintaining SAT. ISE was only established in June of this year. Its journal is the monthly (Socialist), and it also plans to publish (Socialist Esperanto Correspondence). This international is located in Austria at Wien XXI, Angererstrabei 4.</p>
