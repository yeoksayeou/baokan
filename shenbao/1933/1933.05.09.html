<p>日本向俄</p>
<p>收買中東路問題</p>
<p>外部今日發表宣言</p>
<p>中東路爲中俄共同經營</p>
<p>違反協定處理决不承認</p>
<p>俄使館謂未接賣路報告</p>
<p>李維諾夫聲明售路與認僞無關</p>
<p>法使訪日外次請注意法國利益</p>
<p>（南京）　日來日方盛傳蘇俄將出賣中東路權益於日本、記者今日往蘇俄駐華大使館探詢該項消息是否屬實俄大使館人員謂並未接蘇聯政府關於此項問題之報告、但我外交部已於八日致送一節略於蘇聯政府、由莫斯科我大使館轉達外部、並定九日下午四時發表一聲明、述明中東路爲中俄兩國所共同經營、對該路之處理、必須得中俄兩國政府之同東、如違反一九二四年中俄協定之規定處理、該路中國政府决不能承認云、又據外交界確息、關於報載蘇聯政府商議出售中東鐡路事、外交部已電令莫斯科顔大使向蘇聯政府聲明中東鐡路一切事宜、應依照一九二四年中蘇協定處理、非得中國政府同意、任何方面無權處分該路、同時羅外長亦已將此意面告鮑大使、聞外部關於此事尙擬於九日發表正式聲明云、（八日中央社電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）　今日從可靠方面探息、二日蘇俄人民外交委員李維諾夫與日大使太田會晤時、對於出售中東路俄方利益事、顯似絶少進步、當時談話情形迄未發表、但聞李氏曾討論三點、（一）日本對於加拉罕照會延不答復、俄外部表示驚異、（二）東路僞國所派人員之非法片面行動、李氏深表不滿、（三）討論達到和平解决之方法、至出售俄方利益之可能性、即在此時談及云、（八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據可恃消息、蘇俄外長李維諾夫已提議將中東路售與日本或（滿洲國）聞有人以此舉等於蘇俄承認「滿洲國」爲言、但蘇外長答稱、渠深知之、惟蘇俄非爲國聯不承認議案之簽字國、故渠可不必注意於此云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　頃悉蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫請日本迅速答覆是否準備進行收買中東路之談判、或者以日本可否允購該路詢諸日政府發言人者、發言人對於此問、未作切實答覆、但謂日本如决計收買該路、則先須查明蘇俄此請有無他種作用、發言人又謂蘇俄提出出售中東路之建議、足徴莫斯科對於此事之嚴重考慮、蓋蘇俄似了解其在滿之利益有淸理之需要、以期淸除遠東將來衝突之根原云、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　法國駐日大使馬爾坦爾今午往外務省訪問有田次官、詢問華北之情形、俄日「滿」三國共同委員會並東路出售問題等、後對東鐡問題、謂法國於一八九五年設立道勝銀行之際、曾出資約達該銀行資金五百萬羅布之八成、東路建設之際、曾由該華俄道勝銀行融通資金、故於東路問題之解决、法國有甚大之利害關係、若交涉收買之時、望充分考慮法國方面之利害云云、曾喚起注意、惟有田次官答謂、關於東路問題、俄方曾請求政治的解决、現尙未涉及具體的内容云云、迴避明確的回答、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）　俄「滿」對於中東路問題之見解已無妥協之餘地、（僞）滿國擬於最短期間内召開理事會、决定理事會對本問題之態度、已對蘇俄通告此事、但俄方接收此提議與否、尙難預測、（八日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　東京莫斯科間關於東路問題之交涉經過、今日正午由外務省正式報告陸軍省與參謀本部、陸軍與參本部已立即開始研究、研究後再决定軍部之態度、然後與外務省協議、軍部方面對收買東路息見分兩種、一說謂無收買必要、一說則若係廉價不妨購之云、（八日電通電）</p>
<p>羅斯福廣播演說</p>
<p>追述秉政以來之應急措施</p>
<p>並概括說明今後施政計劃</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　今夜美總統羅斯福就無線電演說、播告全國民衆、謂美國不能一蹴而返於繁盛之域、政府亦不能濫作無根據之保證、新政府成立迄今之舉措、</p>
<p>制止收縮進程大部份屬於停止進行緊縮通貨、尙未可謂開始廣大膨脹計畫也、至於通貨雖將加以膨脹、但其範圍將以社會之需要爲度、</p>
<p>力謀提高物價又謂今後立將施行之計畫、將謀恢復物價、使舉債之生産者、得將與舉債時同價値之貨幣償還債主、雖然政府亦不欲造成一種局勢、使舉債者所還貨幣之値少於實際所借者、（按美國自胡佛政府緊縮通貨後、物價大跌、金元大漲、波拉氏曾謂目下購換一金元所需之麥、在數年前祗需半數可矣、故總統有此語、）</p>
<p>實行複本位制總统嗣及金本位問題、表示政府或將復用若干白銀爲貨幣、謂黄金與一部份白銀、乃吾國貨幣完善之基礎、但鄭重聲明必不令銀幣有過多之勢、</p>
<p>禁金出口理由嗣論及禁金出口、謂當時情形設不加挽救、勢將耗用大部份存金、以維持國家之信用、政府存金流出不已、更將削減聯邦與私人之信用、而將産生實在的恐慌、停滯工業之運行、　　拒用黄金償債嗣又解釋政府拒絶用黄金償付公債本息之理由謂美政府前此所允用黄金償還之公債、約近三百萬萬元、私家公司所允用黄金償還之證券共逾六百萬萬元、今美國存金不足四十萬萬元、而全世界存金亦僅一百十萬萬元、遠不敷還債之用、至今後兩月之政策、將一循舊貫、力謀物價之提高、並將盡力制止流禍無窮之自殺的競爭、此種競爭將抑低物價與減削薪工、而造成以前之局面者也、</p>
<p>計劃工程程序政府刻正計劃一公共工程程序、將給工作者以公允之工資、以爲首倡、俾工人得有充分金錢、購回其所生産之一部份、</p>
<p>關於國際談話至關於美總統與外國代表之談話、僅略爲論及、表示各國間關於軍縮·戰債·匯兌·及袪除貿易障壁等、極有同意之希望而已、</p>
<p>限制權力運用最後答復反對派所稱總統已擁有狄克推多大權之語、謂國會並未放棄實權、目下所通過之法案在時效、與權力方面俱有限制、政府並未將農業或運輸或商業置於全權管理之下、迄今曾行使廣大之管理權者、不過對於銀行一業而已、而此舉業已使時局略有進步云、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>「五九」之回顧與前瞻明</h3>
<p>自民國四年日本强迫袁世凱政府簽定廿一條以來。吾人年年圖雪國恥。於今十有九年。乃舊恥并未雪除。而新的恥辱。反日增加。較之廿一條簽字當時何止十倍。如在從前。東三省各鐡路之合辦。鑛山森林之開採。以及警察權等之喪失。我國猶能尋覓和平出路。有從容自救之機會。今則東北三省横被刦奪。且進而强佔熱河。吾人縱欲偷片刻之安而不可得矣。推原究竟。「五九」之承認廿一條件。實種其惡因。然此種惡因所以不能拔除且愈陷愈深者。則歷來之政府當局。不能辭其責也。</p>
<p>雖然民國之主權。究在人民。設使政治而不淸明。有軍閥而不能制止。有貪官污吏而不能肅淸。在當政者固應負責。而人民放棄自己責任。無積極有力之表示以監督其「公僕。」則又我人民之咎也。然我國人民何以長取放任態度。其間亦有說焉。第一歷史的惰性過深。我國自周秦至今。政治在表面上。爲儒家思想所支配其實「無爲而治」之習慣。深中於全國人心。一般社會。又缺乏活力。夫政治鬭爭。本爲開明爲公共利益的鬭爭。乃亦相尙詭詐。漸至政治上之得失。僅屬個人權位之興替。於公衆殊鮮關聯。習俗相成。千年未變。一旦外敵襲來。當局軟弱。而人民亦并爲魚肉矣。第二。我國爲農業國。商業經營。雖早具雛形。但一般社會。仍牢守手工業狀態。復以海外廉價商品侵入。繼之以金融資本之獨占。農村受内亂與外力二重之剥奪。乃益破敗。商業亦以技術幼穉。組織脆弱。致不能轉變爲近代資本主義。形成完全自由獨产之國家。一旦外敵侵凌。又將何以自拔。</p>
<p>現在之政府當局。不能打開目前之難局。衝破日本軍國主義之武力進攻。殆爲我全國共同承認之事實。而國民則視此切膚之事同於隔岸觀火。然則我國將從此永受宰割。爲帝國主義所支配耶。吾敢堅决肯定答之曰否。以最大多數受苦最甚出力最多之勤苦民衆。受外侮與内紛之敎訓。旣鉅且久。自必漸次覺醒。思有以表現其固有而藴藏未顯之能力。試以此次沿長城各地對日載役而論。舉凡通都大邑。對此民族戰爭。類皆淡焉置之。視若無事者然。而接近戰線之各鄕村。與夫河北鄕村中之勤苦農民。大都竭其能力。扶助身當砲火之戰士。甚至毁家赴難。均不顧惜。大有如淞滬戰役同仇敵愾之概。即可以證明大衆之自覺。不過農業社會之人民。其思想粘着力特别强固。故其表現似甚守舊。而一切行動。又覺遲緩笨拙。欲立起與近代之科學工業資本爭鬭。勢固難能。然而我國人民之誠實勇敢樸厚耐勞。亦具特性。縱在極不堪之困苦環境中。亦能打開自己之出路。設再以科學組織。從中調和。則羣集力之巨大。必有出乎當世意料之外者。</p>
<p>是故一般大衆處此窘迫情勢之下。對於國心。默然無所表現者。非眞愚拙也。非眞甘心坐待宰割也。一旦時機成熟。必將奮起其合羣之全力。秉守其誠慤堅忍之精神。發爲廣大之民族鬭爭。續持至於十年百年。與激於一時侵略衝動之日本軍閥。作殊死之戰鬭。以搏取最後之勝利。亦未可知。是則在「五九」國恥中。瞻望前途而深願國人自勉者也。</p>
<p>（紐約）　美國著名銀行家今夜解釋總統演說、謂今後美國舉債將用一新辦法、至少在若干時内不復發行担保黄金償付之債券、並料今後所有政府公債、悉將以合法貨幣償還、但逆料執券者當亦不致向法庭起訴、要求以黄金償還也、按目下公私債券之有黄金償還條文者、美國人所執約共五百萬萬元、其餘則散在國外、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>檢查租界工廠權案</p>
<p>重心移至使團</p>
<p>各國公使已向本國政府請示</p>
<p>市府或將與工部局試行磋商</p>
<p>國聞社云、以共租界工部局、擬操握檢查工廠權、開納稅西人特别會議、通過修改洋涇浜附則第三十四欵、復經駐滬各國領事團特别會議通過工部局檢查工廠權、市長吳鐡城曾一再聲明、不容破壞整個勞工行政、並函各國領事抗議工部局之非法行爲、而領事團及工部局、俱表示願意與市政计磋商解决辦法、國聞社記者、昨日各方面探悉各項消息、茲分誌如左、　　呈公使團</p>
<p>各國駐滬領事團、曾於上星期二、假江西路美總領事署開特别會議、討論該案、結果、以修改洋涇浜章程附則案撇開、而通過一議案、承認工部局有檢查工廠之權、惟議案開列辦法、命工部局與市政府商洽合作、該議案通過後、即由各國領事分别呈報駐華公使、請求批准、惟公使團接獲該報告、尙未正式討論、昨據國聞社記者探悉、根本辦法該案之焦點、已移至公使團、而各國公使、已各向其本國政府請示、故此事迂迥曲折、解决之期、非指顧間事矣、</p>
<p>抗議未復</p>
<p>市政府對於工部局召集納稅西人特别會通過修改章程案後、數日間即分别函致各國駐滬領事、以法律及歷史爲根據、指摘工部局之非法舉動、要求各國領事以公正態度、糾正工部局之錯誤行爲、而領事團即召集開特别會議、承認工部局之檢查工廠權、至對市政府之抗議、迄未答復、聞市政府因靜觀趨勢變化、不再催問、或再度抗議、</p>
<p>市府態度</p>
<p>市府方面之態度、據發言人於昨晨談、市府對於此事之態度、自工部局之動機發生以來、即經一再明白表示、諒爲各界所深悉、無論如何、不容破壞整個勞工行政、不放棄絲毫主權、而最近須靜觀其前途發展、不欲發表意見、</p>
<p>試行商談</p>
<p>又據市府發言人談、工部局費信惇、曾於前星期六上午、往訪市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、表示工部局願與市政府磋商該案、覓取解决辦法、現市府亦將派員、於下星期往工部局答訪費總裁、試行談話、惟屆時是否往訪、抑候其再來、則尙未確定耳云云、</p>

<p>再論今日中國之國家</p>
<p>與政府中央日報</p>
<p>曩者、陳彭叛國案在法庭公開審判之日、記者曾本法理及現行法律、於陳彭供詞及律師章士釗之辯文、鄭重提出今日中國之國家及政府一問題爲天下論壇、稍正是非而明黑白、愚論旣揭本報、一昨章士釗投文上海申報、題曰國民黨與國家、文中論點要旨、大抵悉指本報前揭社論、記者自忖前次行文、純據學理及法律、於章士釗辯詞疵謬之處、除爲學說法理之糾正辯難以外、絲毫未涉本題旨趣以外、頃觀章士釗在申報所表論文、文中所論各點、自有待再爲譬曉、然綜覽其全文詞旨及語氣、則凌厲之氣、拉雜之詞充塞行間、已多溢出論家樊籬之外、若章君論及約法而必冠以「所謂約法」者、涉及本黨遂名之曰「權黨」、測本報前次社論之動機謂與法庭之判决相感召、且進而爲之言曰、「中央日報負黨以趨、意之所指、輒生殺予奪人」、凡此詞意、所以逞其笑駡僇辱者、無不備至、章君個人旣往、足爲天下後世所譏評僇辱之資者、自有大下後世、章君二十年來於人於已、所以資爲百年是非統計之地者、自有百年以後之統計、章君昔日蹀　南北、所負以趨者、彼物彼志、在天下後世之觀感、亦自有天下後世、吾人今日决不因章君之尤而爲倣效、貿然於論旨之外、以一矢遺章君、偶憶章君在京出庭抗辨歸滬之日、在滬自作談話、曾自言政府當局於其辨詞、絲毫未加阻止、京中黨内外各報、亦盡量予以披載、不漏隻字、章君目爲政府辨白干涉言論之無據、章君肺腑、天下明眼人皆能燭之、非記者所欲贅一字、記者今日猶必保持本黨從來優容之態度、以與章君一論國家與政府問題者、蓋以章君自命爲學人、於其自身生息之國家政府之性質、終不忍使其長此冥惑而不解也、</p>
<p>訓政府期約法之制定爲國民會議、根據國民會議之選舉法、國民會議係由全國人民所舉之代表及國民黨之代表所組成、國民會議代表並無何種黨籍之制限、正如章君文中所言、章君旣認國民會議代表無黨籍之制限、則其承認國民會議爲全國人民代表所組成、不難於文義中見之、國民會議由此全國人民代表所組成、訓政時期約法則由國民會議議决通過之、故約法中所賦與本黨之權、皆爲民意所授與、「訓政時期、由中國國民黨全國代表大會代表國民大會行使中央統治權…」國民黨與國家此種法律上之關係、如記者前文所論者、其爲全國民意所授與、則由章君所論亦可推見之、不待吾人再爲引論、記者前論於國民會議之性質、未曾涉及、且亦根本未言國民會議卽爲國民黨會議、使國民會議僅爲國民黨會議、則約法並非全國之約法、而僅爲國民黨之約法、又使國民黨代表行使中央統治權之根據、僅爲國民黨全黨會議之决議而非全國民意之授與、則國民黨今日代表國家之資格、在法律上卽無依據、反對國家與反對國民黨有别、惟在此塲合尙有可說、章君於國民會議知其一而未知其二、一者何、國民會議之組成其代表不限於黨員、國民會議爲全國人民代表之會議而非國民黨會議、二者何、國民黨與國家之一體、由全國民意所授與是也、國民會議與國民大會性質逈殊、權職亦有别、國民會議之名詞、見於總理北上宣言、而國民大會之名　、則屢　於總理遺敎、其最具體之說明、尤在建國大　、國民會　爲全國國民在某一時期「對於時局謀中國統一與建設」之一種會議、總理十三年北上宣言中所言主張召集國民會議之最大動機、卽爲謀中國之統一與建設、而其理論根據、則爲（一）使時局之發展、能適應於國民之需要、（二）使國民能自選擇其需要、凡總理所主張「於曹吳用事之頃」及　告於遺囑中者皆指國民會議而非國民大會、國民會議爲臨時解决時局之會議、在時間上爲暫時的、其對象爲暫時的時局問題、至於國民大會、則性質職權逈異、建國大綱第二十三條「全國有過半數省分達至憲政開始時期、卽全省之地方完全成立時期、則開國民大會决定憲法而頒布之」、又第二十四條「憲法頒布之後、中央統治權則歸於國民大會行使之、卽國民大會對於中央政府官員有選舉權、有罷免權、對於中央法律有創制權有複决權」、由此以言、則國民大會者、全體人民代表集合之團體也、此團體之職權、在憲政時期開始之初爲　瘊定憲法而頒布之」、在憲政時期中、則爲行使中央統治權、國民大會之産生、必在訓政時期完成以後、換言之、卽全國有過半數省分達至憲政時期、卽全省之地方自治完全成立時期、訓政時期中國國民黨所代表而行使中央統治權者、爲國民大會而非國民會議、訓政時期之中、全國方經軍事時期之非常破壞、全國各省未能完成地方自治、在此時期中、國民方在保育訓導之中、故國民大會、根本尙未存在、章君所謂超國家者、自未免爲節外之杞憂、章君旣認主權不可分割、則訓政時期中之主權旣經根本大法賦與國民黨、國民黨外之任何團體自不得竊尸其名、訓政時期中無國民大會、國民大會在訓政時期中無法産生、事實上如此、中國建國之國民黨的憲章遺敎皆明明如此規定、章君責記者於此下一轉語、因其假定之前提不能成立、當然無從爲之結論、此邏輯上基本原則也、</p>
<p>中央統治權與治權大異、統治權　於國家而治權則屬於政府、誠成謂羅羅淸疎各有部居、章君就其「固陃所知」謂主權當英文ＳＯＶ　ＲＥＩＧＴＶ而統治權或治權當英文politicalpower所以闢愚說之理據、卽在此英詞之杜撰、去統治權一名詞係日人由德文中譯出、英文中頗難得其偶、必欲在英文中求其匹偶、則统治權之譯名、必爲sovereignpewer而决非籠統之politicalpower一詞可以概括、且卽其統治權與治權之内容觀之、更可識别、總理建匣大綱第二十四條「憲法頒布之後中央統治權則　於國民大會行使之」、其下總理更釋所謂中央統治權者、「卽國民大會對於中央政府官員有選舉權、有罷免權、對於中央法律有創制權、有複决權」、之四權者、總理名之曰政權、按之通常憲政國家、政由民主、其人民所　而主者、大抵曩日僅爲選舉、而近頃　及於覆决創制、故主權在民一語、其所在之實質、卽此而止、中央統治權行使之内容、旣爲此四種政權、則主權是已、中央統治權者、主權之動的使用狀態也、此與治權自非可同論、原夫治權理論所宗起於孟德斯鳩三權分立之說、孟氏創之、而北美獨立時、費城憲草會議諸子和之、盡納其義於美憲、故總統兩院大理院三界劃然如鴻溝、各不相犯、所謂立法行政司法三種治權果與選舉罷免創制複决四者何涉、章君一舉英詞、ＰＯＬＩＴＩＣＡＬＰＯＷＥＲ遂欲强兩種不同之物爲同、不知章君所示我之轉語爲何、章君於愚統治權之論據、旣絲毫未能動　、則章君所欲集矢之問題、卽根本未有解答　章君一再侈言邏輯、因謂破壤主權、未卽爲破壞國家、是誠大惑不解者矣、夫國家组成之要件有三、土地人民主權是、三者之中、偶損其一、卽爲叛國、猶之身體自由、縲絏一人之足、或擊累其手、皆可謂之侵犯身體自由、更取淺顯、批章十釗之頰或撻章士釗之臂、或損及章之　髮者、同爲傷害章士釗之身、由章之說、必使章之四肢　身徧體鱗傷、方得謂爲傷害章之身體乎、故變更國體爲叛國、變更國體者、於土地人民皆無損者也、眼前取　、如鄭孝胥之佐命溥儀降附日人、其於東三省之人民、並未屠戮、必如章君所言、則鄭逆所損者但國家之土地與主權而已、鄭亦不能目爲叛國也、使他日鄭逆身繫法庭、乞靈於章律師之辨護、吾知章氏爲鄭解脫之詞、當無逾於此、是其自陷於邏輯矛盾之域、誠可笑已、</p>
<p>蘇維埃國家與中華民國國體之别、前嘗論之、章士釗諡訓政爲專政、由此而言「中國國民黨專政、蘇俄無産階級專政、此正兩國相同之處」、章君旣習名學、應知此較事物、應先就事物之内容着眼、昔有人叩其師曰、羊一獸也、牛亦獸也、是牛等於羊、章君所觀於中俄今日兩國國體、毋乃類此、中國國民黨以建國之黨、在訓政時期代表行使中央統治權、在法律上是由全國國民民意結晶之約法而來、蘇俄共産黨之專政、其同於是乎、約法關於人民、國民無男女種族宗敎階級之區别、而蘇俄則只許勞工者有公權、蘇俄國民之權利其同於是乎、中國國民黨之基礎在全民、本黨總章於黨員之加入絶無階級或其他限制、蘇俄共産黨之基礎在於階級、且今日國民黨訓政時期約法有無類似蘇俄憲法第六十五條第一欵至第五欵之條文及精神、共産黨之主義學說有無還政國民及訓政等規定、又是否以民治民享民有之政治爲目的、且以事例言之、今日中央之特任官由非黨員任者有幾人、其他公務員之由非黨員任者又有幾人、非黨員之公權與黨員所異者安在、卽以主權論、普通代議政治國家、事實上其主權實由多數人委託於少數人行之、是說也、法儒歐里安ＨＡＵＲＩＯＵ嘗痛論之、故中國現在政制、統治權暫寄於黨實取代議政治之質而法律化之、是惡可與僅保階級利益之國家爲同其國體耶、</p>
<p>章君拳拳不忘辯護之責、故「國民黨與國家」六中、再爲陳獨秀辨曰、有人偶揚蘇俄、謂中國治道宜進於是、獨以叛國之罪加之、又曰、「國家號爲立憲、選民大抵享受依法變更憲政之權、愚主陳獨秀倡言推翻國民黨並非危害民國、及布達未來之政治理想無背於近世立憲國之通則、自信確有法據、深叶人情」、夫陳獨秀過去之行爲、是否「偶揚蘇俄」及「布達未來政治思想」足以盡之、選民享受依法變更憲政之權、是否卽爲暴動屠殺之權、陳獨秀在民國十六年漢口南昌之大暴動及同年年終在廣州與海陸豐之大屠殺皆爲主要人物、此種人物、此種行爲、謂爲無背於近世立憲國之通則、章士釗若起白芝浩載雪於地下而就敎之當亦可使其有蓬之心、稍去茅塞、否則卽有舌如簧、有筆如刀、當亦無所施技、陳獨秀之叛國、可　諸法律、可訴諸全國民意之總投票、「百年是非統計」中、觀於章君所論辨、必有棄書而歡曰此言僞而不辯、叩其兩端而竭已、記者前論國家與政府、揭布於前月二十六日、而法院之判决卽在是日、記者於此刑事大案論列之日、所以必遲至宣判之日而不在辯論進行中及辯論後者、誠恐或有妄加測度之人、横加誣蔑、然本報於法庭宣判之日揭載前論而章君猶目爲意之所指輒生殺予奪人、章君自許於法庭滔滔攻擊國民黨而不許黨報有一言爲本黨自明其立塲、一言說明、卽謂予人生殺、是章君刻意擀陷、其心計筆舌、尙出於白刄之上、意者、「三一八」時代執政府門前之下意識、至今尙憧憬於腦中、執政府門前之殺機與老虎週報主撰之聯想、不覺流露於無形、故「寒家再毁」之記與李煜瀛等通緝之令、前後相爲輝映、所謂生殺予奪者毋乃在彼而不在此、至今物換星移、此物此情、已入於「百年是非統計」之列、本可存而不論、然必欲使全國人有此回憶者、則章君之所自求也、　　國恥週演講</p>
<p>蔡孑民先生講日本對華政策</p>
<p>五月七日在上海靑年會講</p>
<p>今天我所要講的，是日本對華政策。日本領土甚小。可是野心却甚大，因此種種强暴行爲，已是指不勝屈。這野心大而地位狹隘的日本，適與地大物博之中華爲緊隣，因此他的强暴行爲，就只有向我們中國發揮了。日本自明治維新跟着把歐洲帝國主義，資本主義，樣樣學來了以後，牠開始就以侵略中國爲政策的對像。這個政策。可分作四點觀察：</p>
<p>第一日武力侵略。在民國紀元前三十八年，西鄕隆盛當國之時，日本就有侵佔高麗的主張。雖則後來没有實現，而明年卽有攻台灣之役。民國紀元前三十二年，進而併吞琉球。民元前十八年，朝鮮政變，内部發生黨爭，日本乘此機會，出兵干涉，照彼時中日間所約定，對於朝鮮如有什麽行動，必須雙方共同出兵，但日本竟自派兵前往，因此發生了淸日之戰。結果吾國大敗，日本就佔有朝鮮。這時日本已有奪取我東三省地圭的野心，所以議和之後，就把遼東半島佔去，後因俄·德·法·三國干涉，才由中國給他赔償，把遼東贖還。日本當時處於國際壓迫之下，不敢孤行，才肯把已吞進嘴的遼東半島吐出，但他野心是没有一天稍稍戢止。結果就取去了台灣。民國紀元前十二年庚子之役，義和團在津起事，日本的台灣總督兒玉氏欲進氏厦門，占據福建，彼時伊藤尙在，他認爲不妥，恐歐洲干涉，才没有實行。民國紀元前八年，日俄在我東北地方開戰，日方又勝，於是他又承襲了帝俄在我東北南部的特權。民國前二年，日本滅朝鮮。日本滅朝鮮的方法，起初先慫態朝鮮獨立，從中奪去朝鮮的實權，然後再進一步實行併吞。現在他在東北製造僞國，就是這　套老把戲。民國三年，歐洲大戰，日本以恊約國名義，佔取德國在我靑島的租借地和膠濟鐡路，想繼續德國在山東的權利，戰後復於靑島設派遣軍司令官，於膠濟路沿線設守備隊六大隊，成爲特殊的勢力。後因華府會議我國才得收回。民十六年我國革命軍北伐，日本又出兵山東，謀阻北伐進行，致釀成五二慘案。二十年九月十八日，日本就在東北發動，實行侵佔我國東三省了。從此以後，日本就明火執仗向我國侵略，其中如天津事變，侵攻淞滬，直至現在，奪取熱河，加緊向我國北方察哈爾方面進攻，没有一天停過，這是我們親眼所見親耳所聞的。這就是日本對我國的武力侵略。</p>
<p>（二）經濟侵略以中國爲銷貨塲，投資地及原料出産所，爲現代資本主義國共同的目的；然日本以後進之故，特於普通的侵略方法以外，更用其他巧取豪奪的手段。於民元前十四年，設東亞同文會，明年，又由同文會産生東亞同文書院於南京，前十二年，移書院於上海。是年，又設日淸貿易研究所：均以詳察中國内地經濟狀况爲目的，而同文書　的　作，尤爲周密，敎職員方面有支那研究　旅　研究：學生方面，有修學調查旅行，　跡遍於各省，報告書至爲詳悉。其在吾國東北，則設資源館及中央試騐所於大連，詳考物産及製造法，而加以科學的研究，詳定計畫，備日本工商業家試辦。彼深知我國人與求物　毋寗價廉的普通心理，於是特備粗製而貶値的物品的以與歐美商人競爭。彼又利用我國工資低廉的習慣，於是有産業歸華的計畫，擴大紡續工業與小規模工塲，低級技術的雜貨工業以與華貨競爭。近年竟由華　輸入而變爲日繭輸華，由原料輸出而變爲原料輸入，危險何如？</p>
<p>（三）政治侵略不平等條約，本爲日本人所經騐過的苦痛，今對於中國仍一一抄襲；姑且不用說了，還有種種甚於其他帝國主義者的侵略；例如將旅大租借地的管轄制度牽引到南滿鐡路公司占有地的管轄制度，而說滿鐡總裁掌有沿路行政權。藉口於維持朝鮮人之公共秩序，在滿洲地方，設立領事館警察與警察所。在鐡路上設護路軍，而此等護路軍與朝鮮邊防軍，常進人中國境内野操，吾國外交部向日本公使館提出正式抗議，從未接到日本答復。至於民國五年所秘密提出之二十一條，尤爲人人共見之事實。</p>
<p>（四）文化侵略歐美基督敎徒，來華傳敎並設學校，曾有人斥爲文化侵略，然彼等實出於自動，而非爲政府所指派；不過敎十萬然遇害時，政府始加干涉耳，而日人則確有文化侵略的事實。例如前述的東亞同文書院與中央試騐所，卽其一例。又如仿歐美基督敎之例而要求來傳佛敎，假科學工作之名，要求到内地測騐地磁，在長江上游搜集魚類標本，均含有政治的背景，故我國政府及學者社會均未曾准許。從前中國考古學者曾與日本學者合組一種考古協會，於發掘的地點發見品的分配及互相通告的規則，均有條文；後來日本學者，未能履行。日本古代文化，源出中國，然日本人對歐洲學術界，恒說欲研究中國古代文化，求之日本，反較中國爲備，以中國歷代兵爭，古蹟多毁，而日本保存較多。此種論調，實欲抹煞中國文化而　東亞代表自居，一二八之役，燬各大學及商務印書館，焚東方圖書館，都是這種動機所保成的。</p>
<p>日本的侵略政策，旣如是複雜而深刻，我們决不是用簡單而浮淺的方法就可對付，這是顯而易見的了。</p>

<h3>廣韶路上的笨牛</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>車轆轆，牛僕僕：車行速，牛命促！逃童牧·牛　軸；角上轟·車行曲；車幾覆，牛被戮！折其角，破其腹；斷的足，餘血肉！這是廣韶路上一件牛撞火車出軌的奇聞，我把來概括而成一首三言詩，句句可以押「入聲」「屋」「沃」「覺」的韻。這首時的本事，便如下文所述：上月丨四月二十六日，廣韶路第十七次貨車混合車，由新街站開行，駛近離西村站約二百步的第一四一椿位；其時，路東茘枝園禾田中有一條三百餘斤的水牛，忽的跳上火車前面的軌道上，拚命的向北飛奔，似乎要做火車的先頭部隊，也許要和火車賽跑。但是，牛行速，車行更速，後面的火車轉眼要追上了；牧童在這情勢危急之下，竭力將牛制止，牛仍拚命前奔，牧童只得棄牛退避田　；機車駛到時，便把這笨牛壓在機軸下面！這一次車，裝運的貨物不多，而牛的體量旣大，兩隻牛角又恰恰支撑在鋼軌上面，以致貨車餐車同時出軌；幸而，人口貨物都未受損，只折斷了二十四格的枕木。這條笨牛却很可憐了！兩角折了，兩耳斷了，牛頭上有了大窟窿了，牛的前蹄已受了刖足刑了，牛腹裂得和切開的石榴一般了，還有食餘未化的牛肚草狼藉在軌道旁邊；這一條其笨無比的笨牛，未免死得太慘了吧！</p>
<p>笨牛，火車的速率，豈是一元大武所趕到上的？牛跟着火車奔跑，已是自不量力；何况還要做那火車的先導？牛的一死，死在「笨不可言」四字上面；結果，只把狂吞大嚼的牛肚草，不及消化而早已狼藉在道旁。笨牛！笨牛！你可以做一般夜郎自大者的前車之鑒！</p>
<h3>只希望</h3>
<p>— 舫人</p>
<p>我也並不夢想吾國的高等敎育辦得像歐美的那麽有成效、義務敎育辦得像丹麥的那麽普及，只希望凡戴了方帽子的大學生，都能寫得一文理淸通順的家信，全國不識字的民衆，不致日益增多到百分之百。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想我國還是世界上的頭等農業國。只希望今後糧食一項，不要再源源的從外洋輸入。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想吾國的工業發達到像德國的那麽新奇，普遍。只希望我現在握着書寫的鋼筆頭，能夠製造一些出來，不要找再用這氣人的洋貨了。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想商人奮起抵制仇貨，只希望不要暗中把一些國貨換了牌子做仇貨賣，抗日緊張的時候，又把仇貨換上國貨的牌號賣。</p>
<p>我也並不夢想凡執醫業的，都能診好凡百的病。只希望不要任意施診，殺人　　我也並不夢想我們四萬萬同胞都去抗日。只希望媚日的漢奸不要層出不窮，殘害同胞，貽笑外人，也就得了。</p>
<p>末了，我也並不夢想我這些希望完全實現。只希望它有若干分實現的可能性</p>
<h3>花片</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>紅色是艶麗，黄色是莊嚴，白色是秀潔，綠色是蒨雅，黑色是沉着。藍色乃紅綠二色所合成；所以又艶麗，又蒨雅。紫色乃紅黑二色所合成；所以又艶麗，又沉着。色彩可以治病，又可以測騐人的個性。</p>
<p>金錢是物質上的味素，女性是精神上的味素；同一味素，而滋味大不相同。</p>
<p>古人說：「士爲知己者死，女爲悅己者容。」其實，到了目下，肯爲知己而死者士不少得，女子的治容，却觸目都是呢！</p>
<p>古人又說：「人生得一知己，可以不恨。」其實，到了目下，知己又豈易得，只有酒肉的知己，豈有患難的知己！陶淵明以菊爲知己，周茂叔以蓮爲知己，皮日休以桃爲知己，王義之以鵝爲知己，晋獻公以鶴爲知己，豈非人們的知己不易得嗎？</p>
<h3>龍華華瑣話</h3>

<p>龍華本來是個極平凡的鄕鎭，但在久過城市生活的上海居民，却認爲與吳淞砲臺灣同樣是遊覽的勝地。</p>
<p>一個敗瓦頽垣的龍華寺，幾尊滿頭雀糞的南無佛，居然吸引了不少的有錢大亨和白種人光顧，短袖長袍，高跟革履的摩登小姐，也在爭先恐後，折腰屈膝，喃喃地幹他們和跳舞，打高而夫球極端相反的念佛，求籤的工作。</p>
<p>一個厭世嫉俗的悲觀論者或懺悔罪惡的唯神論者，才會削髮受戒，爲要避絶塵囂，歸依凈土，入山惟恐不深，但在龍華寺的和尙，却不能不和這班凡夫俗子，甚至十足肉感的摩登女郎周旋，口唸阿彌陀佛，心裏計較多，我不知他們要到何日，才能脫離苦海，誕登彼岸啊！</p>
<p>這兒有個寄託孤兒的上海孤兒院，裏面有敎室，禮堂，寢室，花園，陳列室和工藝製作室等，男女學生，多至三四百人，但衣食住全需院裏供給的，只居百分之十，它不能盡量容納一班可憐的孤兒，據說是没有固定經常費的緣故，學生半日讀書，半日做工，他們天眞爛漫地藴藏着笑臉，似乎表示歡迎我們去參觀，工藝的科目Ｌ有剌繡，籐工，竹工，木工和鞋工五種，成績品都在陳列室展覽着，精緻巧妙，和市售品並没什麽軒輊可分，據引導我們參觀的金君所述，他們正要積極去謀發展，但向這種没有出息的事業投資的人究屬少數，只怕落得一個「事與願違」，的確，這塊面積有限的孤兒殖民地，是要靠有錢的慈善家去開拓的，一個以「遊覽勝地」著名的龍華，便只有這一點値得呌人注意。</p>
<h3>岑雲階遺事</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>梁燕蓀之死，方喧騰報紙，而岑雲階又以作古聞。逝者如斯，不勝耆舊凋謝之歎已。雲階字春煊，世號岑西林，則人以地名，援翁常熟李合肥之例也，歷官甘肅布政，陜西巡撫，兩廣總督，四川總督，郵傳部尙書，民國以來，又一度爲護法政府總裁，處事嚴峻不苟，朝野莫不敬憚，但其對於僚屬，則恩惠有加，始終如一。聞其幕友有岑愼張鳴岐二人者，岑俱得之信任，號稱二賢，然愼澹於名利，鳴岐則頗熱中干祿，岑每保奬，必列愼名，而愼反以駑鈍自避，岑保奬一十餘次，愼心不稍動，岑深嘉其志行之高。而愼亦感恩知己，隨岑終身不去，鳴岐初在岑處辦收發事，旣而乞假應鄕試，更納粟爲剌史，岑官晋撫，得保觀察，岑平蜀匪之亂，又奏請賞加卿銜，帮辦軍務，奈爲軍機處所反對，未能如願以償，後岑督兩粤，稪力薦之，遂補太平思順道，權布政司，及贛撫某去職，鳴岐乃以詔命繼任，榮膺顯位，名震一時，岑之提掖有如此。據聞岑之先世爲桂士司，代有名將，岑爲襄勤公之後，自幼習弓矢，天寒檐漏成冰柱，岑輒發矢射之，百發百中，不讓穿楊楊由某專美於前。故其征桂匪陸阿發，猶御短戰裙，雜士卒中，發矢殪敵，陸阿發畏之似神，蓋己亦險遭射斃也。岑年來爲海上寓公，不問政治　終日杜門不出，以書卷自遣，不料以中風逝世，享壽七十三歲，岑行三，家人咸以三老爺呼之。</p>
<p>社會寫真</p>
<h3>上海早話</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>本文的前奏曲都會總帶些神秘和浪漫的色彩，尤其在晚上更顯現着濃烈。張若谷所著的上海夜話，便是這一類的寫眞。他的活潑靈動的筆尖，充滿了藝和愛的氣味，眞呌人佩服之至。</p>
<p>上海的早晨，是寂靜的，是蟄伏的，當然比不上夜的有精彩。可是諸位不要以爲里巷中的木穉香味；馬路上的垃圾汽車；工廠門前的男女苦力，是上海早晨中的代表作。着實有幾種天眞淳樸，够人尋味的現意兒。不過都市的人們，那個有黎明卽起。於是這早的賞識，不得不讓給那下列幾種的人們了。</p>
<p>南陽橋的花市這裏没有年紅電燈；没有爵士樂奏；也没有大腿和長眉；更没有臙脂和香粉。濛濛曉霧中，有時襯着曉星殘月；有時央着疲弱的街燈，馬路的兩旁，成列的擺着擔子，各式的花樹，爭奇鬥豔，好像賽珍會一般。在春天的時候，牡丹像王子一般的驕傲；桃花像舞女一般的妖冶；蘭蕙像村女一般的素凈。到了夏天，玟瑰花像仙女般的面頰，散出一股的濃香；茉莉花和白蘭花，像賣肉的女郎，正拚命地在誘惑路人。到了秋冬，菊花咧，水仙咧，臘梅咧，也挨次的陳列着。塵囂的馬路，立時成了一個衆香國，萬花筒。紅日漸漸的升起，花市收歇了，又恢復了都市的熱閙，煩惱，污濁…種種的面目。</p>
<p>這花市我每星期要接觸一次，爲甚麽呢？國事到這地步，我心裏早已預備做一個準亡國奴了！可是口裏不服輸，也學着時髦，高喊着麻將救國！老酒救國！每逢禮拜六的晚上，總和着幾個同志，念圈馬將，幾斤老酒，努力幹這種救國工作。這兩種工作幹畢，天也快亮了，睡又睡不穩，便信步的走到這花市裏。眼對羣花，鼻聞衆香，倒也可把疲乏的精神振作一下。於是我又加多了一種工作，呌做看花救國。跑馬廳畔的鳥集西藏路的旁邊，矮矮的鐡栅，圍着一塊廣大無比的草坪，那是人盡知道的跑馬廳了。每逢春秋兩季賽馬的當兒，狹狹的人行道上，有山東佬的西洋鏡；有唱小調的賣梨膏糖；還有形形式式的吃食難，好像城隍廟一般的熱閙。平常的時候，每逢午後或晚上，要是天晴的話，也有告地狀的乞焉；也有各式的小販，這也是人人所知道的。現在所說的鳥集，却在一淸早時候。凡是養鳥的人，總提着鳥籠，到這裏來聚集。讓這籠中的小囚犯，吸收些淸新空氣；並且可以和同類的朋友，訴說些寃苦。成排的鐡栅尖上，掛滿了鳥籠，好像像開賽鳥會一般，他們呌做「冲鳥」。籠鳥這樣天天的冲着，毛羽也鮮澤了；嗓音也淸危了；於是身價也高貴了。所蓄的鳥，拿到這裏來冲的，不出下列的幾種：像小姑娘般嬌小玲瓏的秀眼鳥；畫着白色長眉的畫眉鳥；口齒伶俐，像音樂家一般的百靈鳥。這幾種鳥的鳴聲，自然是婉轉悅耳，所以人們肯蓄養它，玩弄它。我問問幾個養鳥的人，說：「鳥的好壞，全在它們呌的環頭，好的鳥呌起來，接連有十幾個環頭，那要値百元左右了。」</p>
<p>本來養鳥這件事，在道學家眼光看來，是「玩物喪志。」但是借此可以練習早起，倒也不無裨益。</p>
<p>養鳥本來是一件没有實用的事情，可是我們的國家，養了幾百萬的兵，也有甚麽用。倒不如養幾隻鳥兒，天天還有些美妙的歌曲給你聽咧。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第六回甜苦情場冷觀評兩面崎嶇世路密約訂三年</p>
<p>剛一出大門，關耀武十二歲的大兒子，就走着迎上前來，呌了兩聲叔，然後伸着向關耀武道：爸爸，给我幾個銅子，讓我去玩罷。關耀武喝道：道麽大小子，只知道玩。我身上的皮夾子給你媽拿去了，我那裏來的錢？那小孩伸着手出來，被父親一喝，簡直縮不回去。趙自强連忙在身上掏出一塊錢塞到他手上，笑道；大年下，小孩子總想玩玩的，這何必駡他呢？關耀武笑道：我倒不是駡小孩子，我仔細想起來，就不免發牢騷。你想我們辛辛苦苦的掙幾個錢拿回家來，全給别人用了，這是爲着什麽？殷得仁道：爲着養家呀，這有什麽不懂？關耀武道：養家有什麽好處？殷得仁道：養媳婦，媳婦可以和你先兒養女。養兒女，兒女長大了，可以養活你。關耀武道：道話是眞嗎？兒女將來會養活我不會養活我，現在不知道。若說娶媳婦生兒女，我現在總算生了不少了，有什麽好處？大的要錢，小的拉我一身黄湯。趙自强笑道：那末，以前你爲什娶親呢？關耀武走着路，左手取下帽子，右手在頭上摸了幾摸，現出他那滿懷躊躇的樣子來，笑道：我也說不上。只記得當年没媳婦的時候瞧着人家有媳婦自己就想，而今有了媳婦了，轉想着當年没有娶媳婦的好處。趙自强道：人都是這樣，也不但是你一個。說着話，不覺到了電車站，大家正要上電車去，只見田靑挽着剛才同去喝咖啡的那位黄曼英女士，由車上下來。迎頭遇見，無可閃避，只好大家打個招呼。趙自强道：我們到關大哥家去了又出來了，你們一頓咖啡，喝到這般時候嗎？田靑道：不，我們繞了一個彎。三位回海甸去，我有點事，一會兒就來。說畢，行了個軍禮，立刻就跟着那位女士走了。遠遠的看着他二人緊緊的相挨，在馬路邊上，笑嘻嘻的說着話走去。（六四）</p>

<h3>不負責任的坦克車</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>新近報上說，江西人第一次看了坦克車。自然，江西人的眼福很好。然而也有人惴惴然，唯恐又要掏腰包，報效坦克捐。我倒記起了另外一件事：</p>
<p>有一個自稱姓「張」的說過，「我是擁護言論不自由者…唯其言論不自由，纔有好文章做出來，所謂冷嘲，諷剌，幽默和其他形形色色，不敢負言論責任的文體，在壓迫鉗制之下，都應運産生出來了。」這所謂不負責任的文體，不知道比坦克車怎樣？</p>
<p>諷剌等類爲什麽是不負責任，我可不知道。然而聽人議論「風凉話」怎麽不行。「冷箭」怎麽射死了天才，倒也多年了。旣然多年，似乎就很有道理。大致是駡人不敢充好漢，膽不。其實，躱在厚厚的鐡板丨坦克車裏面，砰砰碰碰的轟炸，是着實痛快得多，雖然也似乎並不膽大。</p>
<p>高等人向來就善於躱在厚厚的東西後面來殺人的。古時候有厚厚的城牆，爲的要防備盜匪和流宼。現在就有鋼馬甲，鐡甲車，坦克車。就是保障「民國」和私産的法律，也總是厚厚的一大本。甚至於自天子以至卿大夫的棺材，也比庶民的要厚些。至於臉皮的厚，也是合於古禮的。</p>
<p>獨有下等人要這麽自衛一下。就要受到「不負責任」等類的嘲笑：</p>
<p>丨你敢出來丨出來丨躱在背後說風凉話不算好漢！</p>
<p>但是，如果你上了他的當，眞的赤膊奔上前陣，像讦褚似的充好漢，那他那邊立刻就會給你一槍，老實不客氣，然後，再學着金聖嘆批三國演義的筆法，駡一聲「誰呌你赤膊的」丨活該。總之，死活都有罪。</p>
<p>足見做人實在很難，而做坦克車要容易得多。</p>
<h3>航空救國</h3>
<p>— 適夷</p>
<p>一到五月，便不禁想起過去的五四，五九，五卅之類。這大抵是一開頭便很熱鬧，打國賊，游行，示威，罷市，罷工，情勢非常緊張。隨後，有些聰明人看見情勢緊張過分了，便想出「贖路儲金」，「救國儲金」，或「愛國儲金」等等來解圍。於是一部分人以爲旣然捐一兩塊錢便可救國，就犯不着辛辛苦苦的跑腿或呐喊了；還有些連一兩塊錢也捐不起的，没有資格救國，就祗好閉口無言。於是開頭那種轟轟烈烈的情形。就冷淡下去了；雖然那些儲金的去處大抵都没有下文。</p>
<p>不過這是北洋政府時代的話，目前日政府和國民一致的「國民政府」，情形當然不同：九一八的砲聲一響，東北狠快地就變成了「舊陣地」，起先雖也有些請願之類來點綴點綴，但政府一開頭就要人民鎭靜，有些人因此着實鎭靜，「商界」反對罷市，說這是有損無益的勾當，抵貨之類也有人出來主持，至於「抗日救國會」等等，是足以使「友邦驚詫」的，也「自動地」加上封條。所有救國工作，本來就很鎭靜。祇是日本帝國主義的大砲飛機却還不肯鎭靜。今天打上海，明天攻熱河，還有灤東，平津，察哈爾，似乎中國有一天還剩下一片土，它就一天鎭靜不下去；弄得很鎭靜的救國工作，也頗有點不鎭靜的形勢，例如反對罷市的「商界」，也不得不在一二八關門，而罷工，罷課，武裝等等，更鬧得不可開交。好，現在有人出來說話了，東北之所以淪亡，平津之所以危急，以致中國之所以被侵略，别的没關係，全爲了中國没飛機的緣太。好的，咱們得捐錢出來買飛機丨這當兒便想出了「航空救國」。航空之可以救國，祗看那些担當黨國大事的要人，坐的都是福特機，就是明證。所以救國祗要捐些錢就得了，捐不出錢的當然不配談救國。至於「航空救國」是不是抄的「贖路儲金」，「救國儲金」或「愛國儲金」等等老文章，這倒要看下文了。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 予展</p>
<p>（二十五）談何容易？</p>
<p>蘧廬談座，談客來集，談鋒所至，涉及最近自由談　稿範圍，編者意在避開政治，饒有天下有道，庶人不議之意。予戲爲破題曰；「談何容易？據</p>
<p>未可以自由稱之也。」甲客曰：「不然。黨治賢明，未便目爲無道；民權保障，固巳有其同盟。言論自由，布在法令；文章華國，不乏名流。孰謂放言高論，不見容於當今之世乎？」乙客曰：「殷監不遠，在夏后之世。淸政不綱，豺狼當道。抗日之役，外强中乾，卒訂割地賠欵之約。雖揭　保皇，如康梁之徒，亦莫能爲之諱。初爲淸議報，繼爲新民叢報，掊擊淸廷。刊於異邦，風行祖國。怨讟所積，一發難收。保皇而皇家卒不能保，適中鄙諺幫倒忙之譏。嚴復謂淸本不亡，而亡於梁任公之一枝筆。竊謂嚴老先生但見康梁保皇之失敗，而不知淸廷外交之失敗，民怨乘之，以至亡國。故吾人敢斷言：當時危害大淸帝國，顛覆其所謂國家者，乃淸廷自身，雖多希黨人，摧殘輿論，適益民怨，而速取滅亡耳。」予曰：「君言良是，晚周之時，諸侯放恣，處士徒有横議；南宋之際，金宼肆虐，秀才止於狂言。今何時乎？放恣者豈無變相之諸侯？肆虐者適有類似之金宼。顧今之處士秀才，亦但有横議狂言已耳。文人之舌端筆端，原不過爾爾，抑何足畏乎？諸侯尙無秦政，或不重見焚書阬士之奇災；敵國狡如金人，仍得逼以攘夷主戰之語禁。所幸南穴小朝廷，有孝宗在上，秀才陳亮葉適輩，得以稍爲狂言，發攄積憤，不至逼而造反。故雖有賣國賊秦檜之充得志，未足以語于復讐雪恥，然其國詐，幸而苟延百年。乃晚淸政府智不及此，不惜媚外賣國，而于家奴則壓迫之殘殺之，不稍寛貸，甲午庚子而後，享國僅及十年。不亦宜乎？」予語未畢，滿座爲之欷吁不已。</p>
<h3>新式牢獄</h3>
<p>— 克多</p>
<p>人們都知道：包界上所有的牢獄，都是銅牆鐡壁，戒備森嚴，使人不得自由的。至於把牢獄設在馬路上，確爲人們從未聽過的事。但蘇聯現在却有這樣的牢獄。因爲蘇聯常呌那些行將被釋的富農，或其他犯罪者，建築道路，房屋，砍伐森林；如有技術的犯人，則使他們做公共事業建設上的工作。他們因爲穿着紅軍的服裝（無肩章與帽徽），容易辨認，難得逃亡。他們自由工作，並無軍人看守。同時政府也發工資給他們，不過比平常的勞動者要少些，工作時間也要多些。這緣故是蘇聯當局以富農爲異已分子，所以要剥削他們的勞動。</p>
<p>蘇聯所有牢獄中的設備與待遇，都比其他各國來得優美，對於一切犯罪者，斷没有嚴刑的敲打，苛刻的待遇，他們以爲犯罪者之犯罪之社會的失敎，而不是個人的罪惡，所以對於一切犯人，在可能的範圍内，施行敎導工作，如犯罪者能在行動思想上，對於自己的犯罪，確實表示悔意，就可恢稪自由。莫思科附近波爾柯娃（ＢＯＬＳＫＯＶＡ）敎導院，收容十六歲至二十五歲的靑年刑呈犯，讓他們任意選習一種職業，不加限制。他們身體自由，不受拘束，政府僅派數名警察看視，令勿逃走而已。院内公共事業，都由犯人自己組織各種委員會處理，院中職員僅做輔助工作丨丨購買工場所需要的原料與出售該院的生産品。該院男女犯人如因戀愛而結婚，經過院中婚姻委員審查以後，就可實行同居。</p>
<p>在各牢獄中，都設有客種工作塲，讀書室，飯廳，俱樂部，浴室與運動場等，但政治犯不准看報紙。有許多牢獄，還設立各種學術研究組，指尊員所發表的意見，如不得各組員通過，就不生效力。</p>
<p>犯有政治錯誤的黨團員，則派遣到工農君衆中去工作，使他們在實際生活中認識自己的錯誤，糾正自己的錯誤。政治錯誤較重的，先行拘禁於國家政治管理局，而後流放西伯利亞或土耳其斯坦等處，只要犯錯誤者表示懊悔，就可取消徒刑，恢復黨籍。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— julesrenard作林取譯</p>
<p>洗澡</p>
<p>當快要敲四點鏡的時候，紅蘿蔔鬚狠熱心的把睡在花園裏面榛樹底下的雷辟克和大哥斐利克斯喊醒來。</p>
<p>「我們去吧？」他說</p>
<p>斐利克斯丨那麽走罷，你帶了短袴没有？</p>
<p>雷辟克丨這時候恐怕還太熱。</p>
<p>斐利克斯丨我呢，我喜歡在還有太陽的時候去。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨並且，爸爸，你睡在河邊比睡在這裏還要舒服呢。你可以睡在草地上。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨那麽你們先走罷，慢慢的，不要走急了受熱。</p>
<p>可是紅蘿蔔鬚費了狠大的力才把脚步放慢，他覺得脚上有螞蟻版着似的。他把自己那條没有花的難看的短袴和大哥斐利克斯那條有着紅色和藍色條紋的短袴背在肩上。他喜氣洋洋的扯談，自得其樂的歌唱，從路旁那些低垂的樹枝上面跳過去。他像在天空游泳，他對斐利克斯說；</p>
<p>「你以爲這事有趣嗎，嘿？把兩隻脚是這樣動着！」</p>
<p>「你這淘氣的東西！」大哥斐利克斯回答，現得沉着而又不屑的樣子。</p>
<p>眞的，紅蘿蔔鬚突然寗靜下來了。</p>
<p>他毫不在意的首先跨過一道石砌的短牆，而那滚滚的河流便突然出現在他的眼前。現在已不是說笑的時候了。</p>
<p>洶湧的河面反射出閃閃的回光。</p>
<p>河水像牙齒相擊似的蕩漾着，發出一種枯索的味道。</p>
<p>現在的問題是當雷辟克對着錶計算規定的時刻的當兒，他便要跳　水裏，留在那兒，並且一心貫注在這上頭。紅蘿蔔鬚打了一個冷戰。他這次又和以前一樣，自己鼓勵着要支持到底的那種勇氣，在正是緊要的關頭便失掉了。在融得遠的地方能够引誘他的河水，一出現在眼前，便使他爲難起來。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚一個人站得遠遠的，動手脫衣服。他一方面固然是不願意把他那瘦弱的身軀和他的兩脚顯露給人看，但最大的原因是好一個人毫不害羞的戰抖着。</p>
<p>他把他的衣服一件一件的脫下來，狠細心的摺好放在草地上。他把鞋帶結緊，裝着半天還不能解開。</p>
<p>他穿上短袴，把短衫脫下，因爲他出了汗，汗水像蘋菒種一樣粘牢在他那紙做的假皮袴帶上，他又挨了一會。</p>
<p>大哥斐利克斯却早已跳在河裏了，並且自由自在的把河水激盪着。他用手臂划着，用脚踵拍着，弄起許多泡沫，他並且狠使人驚駭的浮在河中間，把怒吼着的波濤一層層的向兩岸逐來。</p>
<p>「你不想下去了嗎，紅蘿蔔鬚？」雷辟克問。</p>
<p>「我把衣裳哂乾一下再下去。」紅蘿蔔鬚回答。</p>
<p>末了他下了决心，他坐在地上，他用一隻被他那雙太小的皮鞋擦破了的脚指試探着。同時，他用手揉揉胃口，恐怕它還没有完全消化。隨後他便沿着河岸邊的草根溜下去。</p>
<p>那些草根搔着他的脚膀，大腿，和臀部。當河水浸到他的肚子上時，他又向上爬逃出來。他覺得有一條濕漉漉的繩子漸漸地纏在他身上，正像纏在一隻陀螺上一樣。可是他倚靠着的那塊泥土塌下去了，紅蘿蔔鬚便跌在河裏，水蓋没了頭頂，他在泥水中摸索着，站起身來，咳着，吐着，苦苦悶着，眼睛也看不見了，好像失了感覺。</p>
<p>「你眞會濳水呀，我的孩子，」雷辟克對他說。（未完）</p>

<p>蘇浙蠶汛續誌</p>
<p>丹陽</p>
<p>近年來農民對於育蠶問題、均甚注意、繭産優良、惜天時不正、蠶繭迭遭歉收、蠶戶備受虧蝕、今歲米價奇賤、農村經濟窘迫、加以春行冬令、氣候寒冷、桑樹産葉較遲、蠶汛較晚、各市鄕農民植有桑樹者現始借得蠶本、購種孵育、天氣晴暖、夏城吕城皇塘蔣墅一帶、早帮甫二眠開葉、鮑舍陵口閘橋壩頭等處晚帮尙祇頭眠足葉、蠶蟻發育頗佳、</p>
<p>富陽</p>
<p>各市鄕農民今歲經濟恐慌、無力購種、早帮咸將自留之土種從事孵化、而天時惡劣、傾棄十七之八、嗣見天時晴暖、桑樹發葉茂盛、故均借貸蠶本、購育改良種、氣温適宜、蠶　發育　利、桑葉亦欣欣向榮、蠶汛優良、大源鎭·墅溪·湯宋埠一帶早帮三眠旺葉、晚帮亦起眠、眠頭齊整、惜飼額祇及往歲十之四五、</p>
<p>祁婺紅綠茶開秤開園</p>
<p>祁門紅茶自二十七日起至三十日止、連日天氣放晴、各山戶紛紛雇工開採、每日出貨踴躍、品質異常良　、蓋因本年添閏五月、時令雖屆、氣候尙遲、晚種茶葉、抽芽未大、在往年此種嫩葉、山戶須留以時日、不肯卽採、今歲怵於洋莊不俏號方擇優購買、爲免降價棄取、無論葉之長幼、概行摘下、兼有陽光利於晒坯、葉乾少水、故出貨之優近年罕見、茶號初旨、對本年山價、大加贬抑、新盤僅出五十元、山戶以此價不及上年之半多堅不肯脫、嗣號方見新茶湧帮上市、品質不劣、不欲固執盤價、致雙方背道而馳、遂各禁不住鬆盤開秤、依葉質之高下、放盤自六十元至八十元、較舊見跌二三十元、山戶雖欲望未饜、有此不徧之市　、亦願降心求脫、如連日天時做美、各號首二帮茶、立可進齊、不虞缺額、婺源東路溪路龍尾大坂濟溪慶源段莘汪口各處綠茶、比西南茶發育見早、各村茶戶、對採製茶葉、均講求精細、故出品稱良、嘗爲茶號爭先搶辦、今歲各山戶均主提早摘嫰、二十起有多數正式開園、北路各村山戶、本定近日開採、因今早雷雨大作、遂多臨時停摘、待天氣放晴開園、西南路山茶、發育較緩、芽抽尙小、須留長四五日後、可以開摘、（一日）</p>
<p>糧食薄稻獨小角許</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源　三十號、本街店胃仍佳、市况平穩、故蘇同粳及南港米形勢呈定、僅高貨略高數分、至靑角松江泗楓西練等薄稻、雖北洋帮靑島威海衛等客包胃續辦近二千包、但以吃盤苛刻、剔選嚴厲、中次已見分淸、價格修削數分至角砠、杜洋尖仍居定局、常帮粳及變元平穩、陰元乏貨胃香、價漲角餘也、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源二十餘號、白粳店胃　交、市形高貨捲五分、中次角外、薄稻平正、早　到少銷活、價加近尺、　尖定勢、杜埠尖略帶緊勢、客尖挺立、陰元稍疲、白元定勢、</p>
<p>洋客秈到銷兩旺</p>
<p>靑島試辦機元丨　帮去胃逐旺</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈去化甚旺、洋米本街繼續　辦、又有閩帮問津小絞、市價又回好五分、計開出一千三百包、價七元六角至五角半、西貢一號開五百包、價八元二角半、客秈昨有蕪湖米及湘　米到埠五千包、因消化甚旺、市形反見步砌、客秈被閩帮辦去、靑島帮新近試辦江西機元一百○六包、價九元四角半、本街購買洋米外、其他均無問津、客秈計開江西機晚一千八百包、價八元五角八分至一角半、又機早七十三包、價七元、湖南機油三百包、價八元八角、又齊油米一千五百包、價七元九角至六角半、蕪湖蔴秈一千一百包、價七元七角半至二角半、均比前市步好三五分云、</p>
<p>粉價激昂二分半</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午呈初平繼俏之象、以洋麥報價、雖回小三四角左右、惟市塲人心步穩、因各廠抛貨旣少、市氣堅固、且以現洋麥報價亦報高、故業内外買戶活動、津帮雖有回出、其餘各帮則均有收進、因此遠期已較好一分外、迨至下午開盤、市氣又步步良好、以近期有大廠收買、遠期則有山東帮及内地帮、各盤均有收進、所以趨勢可較上午激昂、至洋麥定價、聞阿根庭麥已喊四元九角二分、人心之好、諒卽此故也、結果本月份較前週末漲一分七厘半、六月份漲二分二厘半、七月份漲一分、八月份漲一分半、九月份漲、</p>
<p>一分七厘半、十月份漲二分半云、</p>
<p>小麥被麵粉帶起</p>
<p>昨日期麥　呈堅定之象、上午　　、因洋麥　價小三四角、交易旣不暢、市氣亦見平平、　至下午各盤、各月份交易、已稍暢旺、價亦轉穩、因期粉已俏、市塲人心、亦爲帶起、　廠家並無　意、故漲度亦少也、結果五六月份無比較、七八月份較前週漲二分、九月份未開、十月份下午僅開一價、爲四元六角五分云、</p>
<p>黄荳紅糧市俱疲弱</p>
<p>昨市黄荳走化因出口帮觀望、致成交不多、且來源見接、市氣似覺態疲、統市售開大連豆一車、爲本街辦去、沙黄豆則有二百餘包交易、車豆廠家採取五車、但市價已小去二三分、紅糧到存兩接、而銷化力不勁、故市塲人心見虚、昨市雖有成交、然市形疲軟、</p>
<p>糖市關金步提糖價看好</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以標金荷匯無甚上落、趨勢平平、以會劃盤二四粗砂白仍劃二十元、成交二百餘包、二十·十八號中砂白以及八九號荷赤均呌原盤、絶無交易、號盤有廣潮帮兌出潮靑一百數十包、較高者十二元二角至十二元、中莊十一元六角、最次爲十一元、海南赤數十包、爲十三元六角、正綿赤談價不合、未成交、廠盤有仁記兌出二號中袋建冰五十袋、價爲二十二元四角半、又振新廠亦兌出數十包、價爲二十二元五角、太古車白Ｂ嘜四温半劃過一批、價爲二十一元八角、又昌興行開出ＲＡ綿荷白價二十一元三角、光華糖廠祿字價二十元零三角、壽字價十九元八角、磨砂加廣包二十元零五角五分、據說關金步步升提、糖價至此未免過宜、後盤或將扳起、</p>

<h3>誰願出賣靈魂？</h3>
<p>— 澍</p>
<p>在這個社會裏，如果你僅僅只做「肚皮」的奴隸，或者你只是一個單單抱「肚皮主義」的人，則你儘可舒適愉快地生活着；不然的話，或者你已經十分明白了甚麽是「生」與甚麽是「死」而必定要找出個有意義的究竟的話，那你，除非你已下了最後的决心丨關於K這次的事，我們將以怎樣的感情態度來爲他解釋呢？</p>
<p>這K失業三星期後的事。在這三星期裏、K度着他曾經騐過的流浪生活。雖說「窮」對於他本來就已覺得像家常便飯，因爲失了業，他固然窮，有業時他亦同樣的窮，但是這次。丨丨這還是初次啊，他是深深地嘗着失業的悲哀了丨於是他便感覺擺在他眼面前的，以及凡是佔據有空間的一切，都是猙獰的野獸，而對於這些「野獸」是需要有力的驅逐和征服！但他這樣的心境，只維持了不多天，他就被介紹到一家國貨廠裏做廣告撰述的工作。</p>
<p>「……第一你就應當明白，「廣告」是用以招徠生意的，這不是給你發表議論的地方！」一個肥臉挺肚子的總經理趟在摇椅裏用兩個手指夾住K撰成的第一篇稿子，扳起鐡靑的面孔睨着K發出嚴厲的聲音，如果這時給另一人碰見，必定以爲這個靑年小夥伴犯了廠規而正在受總經理的訓斥。</p>
<p>「比方說，他是一個漢奸，」只停了一忽，總經理又向着K指劃着說，「你就應當稱他是最熱心最愛國的靑年！因爲以此撰廣告，就可把任何人都快樂地吸引到我們廠裏來買貨品！你知道没有？……」</p>
<p>後一星期K的介紹人收到這樣一封信：「……XX廠的事，我已大概的告訴你了。倘若我僅僅是爲着個人肚皮的話，當然我現在已經是很愉快地坐在他們寫字間裏摇椅上，吐吐烟圈子，抓着一個文思便承着總經理一貫的主義而代他寫一兩張廣告，月底伸手拿薪水………這些，自然是人生所謂極樂意的事。然而在我心裏便常常想：「出賣勞力」丨丨實在是「拍賣勞力」，我已經覺得萬分的委屈而致萬分的憤慨，而現在他們竟要我拍賣我的整個靈魂，整個身體丨他們簡直没有把我看待像個人，他們完全當我是他們的一架生産的機器！你想，一個稍有腦子的人，誰願意舍了自己的靈魂而做個人的生産工具呢？縱然感覺肚皮餓得疼以至於死，那我亦只有聽之，而絶對没有與之妥協或是低頭的勇氣！</p>
<p>「當然我是極度感謝你的；但關於我的這些，我求你諒解我，因爲我不僅僅爲着「肚皮」，我並不十分駭怕肚子餓得疼，而且我也很知道「餓」是要餓得死的，不過我需要保留我的人格，保留我的生命！</p>
<p>「我還請求你把以前的我忘掉，因爲那些時的我已經死去了，空氣裏頭已絶對没有了那個東西的存在！我請求你認識我！……</p>
<p>K寫於靈魂尙未拍賣的當兒。」</p>

<h3>招贅的故事</h3>
<p>— 匡貝</p>
<p>夜幕剛剛撤除，在地浸落在稀蔬的晨　裏，還好像一張暗灰色的牛皮紙，還好像午夜一般的穆靜，陰霾，聽不見鄕村常有的鷄啼，也没有鴉鵲一類的鳥呌，這便是都市之晨的特有風韻，也　是都市人民最安適的時候，誰也正緊樓首被褥在鼾睡，說不定有多少人正在做着白晝不曾幻想到的美滿的春夜。</p>
<p>也未免太惡作劇了，弄堂裏忽然晴空霹靈似的起了一陣緊的警笛，於是前樓後樓的居民，不，簡直是全弄堂的居民，都被驚醒了，大家都睡眼朦朧的下了緊急的戒心，爲了要得悉事實的原委，爲了要保全各自個的安寗，於是男男女女，小孩拖着大人的衣袖，聚成了黑黝黝的一團。</p>
<p>「事情是發生在第三號裏的亭子間，十來個警察捉去了一位很縹緻的年靑人，」這是老王奔向弄外去探來的消息。並且他七八分肯定的說：「一定是捉共産黨，没有關係！」</p>
<p>熊五伯却滿不置信，他說：「那人我時常碰面，那麽年輕，那麽縹緻，絶對不是窮苦的共産黨，也該不是什麽匪徒。」</p>
<p>「即使不是共産黨，不是匪，也定不是好人；不然怎麽會遭拘捕！」是另　位的說話。</p>
<p>啦，總該不是好人！」大家哄然一聲，總算是這案件的初步結論，辰光飛也似的奔跑，天色全亮了。</p>
<p>事情尙示得到究竟，大家也就還不放心，不肯走，雖然時候已是「沙沙」的洗馬桶聲了。二房東才趕來把事實的眉目點淸，說：「那人性陳名學海，近三日内地接到數百封信，警察說他是個天大的騙子，所以被捉去了。」</p>
<p>「呵，原來是個天大的騙子呵！」一陣哄然。</p>
<p>二房東繼續着說：「當警察把笛一吹，十來個一齊撲進他的房裏，首先問了一聲是不是陳學海，隨着把他一大堆的信找着了，隨着拏出一張報紙給他看　　茲有簪纓書香士女，容貌秀麗，品　　性温良，旣嫻詩書，又工女紅。本　　可攀配高門，賦唱琴瑟。惟以堂上　　乏嗣，又因士女未曾出入學校，不　　慣戀愛。爰特登報招贅，自問身家　　淸白，貌美品良（貧富不計）有意入　　贅者，請詳書身民，附照一幀，郵　　票二角，寄ＸＸ路ＸＸ里Ｘ號陳學　　海收轉，合則函請面洽，不合原壁　　掛號奉還。</p>
<p>於是這所謂陳學海便在渾身顫抖中被提走了，其實並没有什麽書香士女要招贅，他搬來　不到一個月，從他的一口怪生硬的話裏，可知他是位外鄕客。没有家小，也没有什麽親友來往，平日只見他獨自個在房裏，他竟妙想天開，出門還有這一着把戲。是的，收到一封信，便有二角郵票，積了四五百封，也就有百數塊錢了。難怪他昨早把信捆好，說要退房子，不住了，其實招鬼贅，他是個天大的騙子呵！」</p>
<p>「怎會有這多的人上他的當？」大家圍問二房東，二房東也就又是一番解說，也原是十足有理解有經騐者。</p>
<p>「在都市裏施用這種騙術，確是有人相信。只看平日一般游蜂浪子，哭都哭不到女人，而今說有這樣的機會丨丨招贅，條件又很美滿，誰吝惜二角錢郵票？若是天數得準，遇着了緣，豈不寫意！即或不成，犧牲二角錢郵票，反正不在乎。」</p>
<p>「總歸用這種騙術的人，該殺萬刀咧！」是一位嬌聲的姑娘在挿嘴。</p>
<p>「我活下六十歲了，從没有見過這樣的巧事，這世界眞要反了！」是一位扶杖的長者的嘆語。</p>
<p>事情算已有了相當的明白，人山人海的觀衆，也就踏着暖和的滿地太陽稀疏的散開了。</p>

<p>時間大約是在十年之前吧？他和她結婚了，當她回門的一天，他們倆手挽手兒在我們的鄕下走過，十年前，在上海，男女挽手同行，本不算什麽一回怪事，他們和她們挽手同行的藝術，早已由西洋人那邊考貝得很純熟丁，然而在半開化的我們的鄕下，男女挽手同行，也許第一回發現吧？當他們在街市上走過的當兒，一般的人，又那得不是咄咄而稱怪事呢？三家邨的老學究，看見了他們倆，在並行，氣得鬍髭倒豎而嘴裏正在說什麽「世風日下」！「國亡無日！呢一</p>
<p>就這一點上，我們便可證明他們在結婚的時候，感情是非凡的融洽了。然而不上三四個年頭，他們的感情，忽然由濃密而平淡，由平淡而破裂了。據一般的人說，她的丈夫竟和她的姑娘，兄妹之間，發生了秘密，女人的妬忌是天性，丈夫另有愛人，那能按捺住她那妬火的燃燒，經過了三四年的　釀，結果終於是離婚了。當她離婚而後，那天亂髮蓬鬆，兩眶眼淚，而獨自一人回家的時候我們目覩了她那種狼狽的情形，慘苦的色彩，往日的活潑一變而爲呆雞的時候，腦幕中突然把十年前他們倆新婚後在小市上並行的一回事重復的映了一回而在大嘆那「萬事如轉燭」「夫壻輕薄兒！」一類詩句呢！</p>
<p>她的靑春期雖然已踏上了末梢，然而她總究是關不住靑春之火的燃燒，離了婚以後，她在娘家，守了兩三年的活孤孀生活之後終於和一個男性發生了神秘的關係，但結果她那頑固的父親發覺了她的秘密，頓時咆跳起來，把她要死要活的責備了一頓，那一次她整整的流了一晝夜的苦涙，但她又可向誰去訴苦？終於她的父親把她軟禁住，不許和她的情人再來往而她在夜盡更深的時節舊恨新愁會集在那受過創痕的心靈之上，種種的苦痛也難以用筆墨來形容了。</p>
<p>這是今年的元旦吧？她的前夫，說是在她埠結婚了，那天塲面的闊綽，黨政要人賀喜者的熱閙，開了她埠的新紀錄，她知道了這個消息又哭了足有一個星期。終於她是離家而跑開了她委實不能再守空閨祇有一走，毅然决然的去和她的情人同居。然而直到現在，她雖然和情人是同居，却没有正式的結婚，她如果是結婚了，怕是父親要不認，社會要咒詛。唉！她在這種惡勢力之下，祇有秘密的嫁人，而不能公開的再嫁，男子離婚而後，可以堂皇冠冕的再娶，而女人就不可再嫁。唉！這無非是片面的貞操，而我們應得去打破她的父親，和社會上一般的人所抱的那種舊禮敎上「好女不嫁兩夫，忠臣不事二主。」的成見，而狂呼着「廢　吃人的舊禮敎」的口號，快爲離婚後的她們爭一條生路呢！</p>
<h3>不忘舊好的珠小姐</h3>
<p>— 警愚</p>
<p>珠小姐是Ａ鎭上五年前的一朶交際之花。靠着她這姿首明豓，手腕靈敏，引誘得一般靑年，没有一個不是亡魂失魄！而號稱一鄕首富的Ｘ四少爺，竟因此而傾家蕩産！</p>
<p>Ｘ四少爺破産以后，她也弄到顚沛給流離，幾難生活；而社會的冷嘲熱諷，亦遂相逼而來。她受了這種剌激，感覺到株守之終非長策；於是只好抛棄戀人，别謀生路。從此Ａ鎭上，也就不見了她的倩影。</p>
<p>事閱五載，大家俱已忘懷。今歲淸明節，Ａ鎭上忽來一位服裝華麗的時髦少婦，跟一年輕女傭，穿得也甚整潔。鎭上人驟見之下，莫弗驚異；旣而細加諦視，才認出她就是闊别五稔的Ｘ四少爺的愛人珠小姐。因爲她面部的下頦，天生成蠶豆般的一片硃砂紅痣，見過她這廬山眞相的，當無難想像得之。</p>
<p>聽說她現在已經發跡，嫁的是海上一位富商；居則廣厦，出則汽車，享用的奢侈，過於貴胄。此次回鄕，雖是托名掃墓，實則含着衣錦榮歸，誇耀鄕里的意思。</p>
<p>淪入下層階級的Ｘ四少爷，聞此消息，喜不自勝；一到淸明那天，它即跑到她的父母墳上，息心靜候；等她焚畢紙錠，磕過了頭，它才裝起嬉皮笑臉，用了呌慣的稱呼說道：</p>
<p>「阿珠！你………」</p>
<p>「賊呌化子丨怎的呌起太太名字來」？女傭看着太不像樣，氣憤憤地駡它山門。</p>
<p>「哈哈！你不要駡，你家太太原與我………」</p>
<p>「住了！你要討錢，好好地說，放甚麽屁？」她恐怕說出不好聽來，馬上把它叱止住</p>
<p>「那末請你做做好事，給我一點錢。」它就順風轉舵，變了口氣說。</p>
<p>「好！你就給你幾文。」她說時，向錢袋中取出一疊鈔票，檢了一張五元的給它。</p>
<p>「阿珠！不！珠小姐　　　請你　給一張。」它一手接了錢票，一手又難了開來。</p>
<p>她此時想起前情，不忍加以拒絶；亦即很爽快地再給了一張。</p>
<p>它得了這意外之財，向她把舌頭一伸，扮上一個鬼臉，扛一扛肩，一溜烟的跑到烟館中過癮去了！</p>
<p>隔了一宵，她也就辭别故鄕，轉回上海。</p>
<h3>求愛的把戲</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>瘦猴小李據說還是Ｘ大學附中的高材生。他有廎長的面頰，高瘦的身叚，兩腿且會　幾下足球。凡是Ｘ大學的男同學，只要提到「瘦猴」兩字，誰都知道就是「小李」。</p>
<p>不過有件例外，也許是瘦猴小李平生的一件憾事：便是東宫宫禁森嚴，以致小李無法使一般女同學們拜識自己的大名，以致從中解决終身大事。</p>
<p>來了　　　上互相追逐着的貓　一夜夜的呌到亮；　頭小鳥，也不怕孤獨者的嫉羨，很活潑地一對對的偎依歌唱着。多情種子的小李，歷此可愛而又可惱的春景，在他心弦上所感到的除了「難受」之外，再没有其他的成分！</p>
<p>「難受」「難受」，眞「難受」不過了丨於是他便拿出勇氣來幹了一塲全校鬨動，傳爲佳話的富有詩意的美事。</p>
<p>禮拜六的下午，東宫皇后Ｘ女士。突然接到向她求愛的一封信。略謂：皇后賽過胡蝶的美容，「豐若有餘」「柔若無骨」的體姿，怎樣足以令他忘寢忘餐的欽慕！又幸天假奇緣，同校讀書，彼此應怎樣的抓住「黄金難買」的靑春，不要讓　白白地渡過。末尾，他還拿出自我介紹的精神，說他自己的人品學問，是如何的足夠爲皇后好友的資格。謂予不信，謹於星期日上午Ｘ時Ｘ敎室第三排座位恭候觀光，務乞皇后移玉賜敎是幸云云。</p>
<p>皇后經過一番深思之後，果於翌　移王觀光，確見一位西裝革　，正神氣</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>十足的唸着英文的靑年，恰在第三排座位站起來招呼她；然而她只是好像下了個「原來就是閣下」的意識便立刻迴鑾了。</p>
<p>星期一，正迎着禮堂正面的一塊揭示榜上，眞是意想不到的會令剛做紀念週出來的全體學生，一堵堵的昂首爭看上面貼着的玫瑰色信箋，藍墨水寫的一封楷書信，便是皇后Ｘ女士所接到的求愛信　經大家由所署别名及字跡推測，原來就是我們的瘦猴小李所幹的美事丨　　接着那天又剛逢數學小考，瘦猴小李的白卷上。好像他得了神經病似的會這樣寫着幾句：</p>
<p>「先生題出辣，學生不能答；高興」給幾分；不給也就罷！」</p>
<p>小說</p>
<h3>妇姬的一生（四續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>然而這些事都是每天可以看見的，日本公了，也便處之泰然。</p>
<p>今天，她仍是和每天一樣到了女學堂裏。還没有上課，大家都在拍皮球，當然阙也凑了上去。不留心，别人的球却給她擋了，於是這一女孩子便破口大駡！</p>
<p>「婊子！賤貨！……」</p>
<p>「駡誰？」少不了要回她一句。</p>
<p>「駡你，你是小婊子，誰不知道？」</p>
<p>但是她覺得没有回駡的必要，一個這樣的小　伙，誰怕她，走上前去便是一個耳光，只見那女孩子嗚的一聲哭了出來，一面以手栻着眼淚一面蹬着脚告訴堂長去，有許多女孩子在後面跟着。可是她總覺得算不了什麽，你告訴去好了，誰怕？誰知一會兒果然堂長來了，帶着銅杠眼鏡的中年婦人，一雙纏過而後放大的腫得很高的脚，在靑石板上走得非常之嚮。最後終於到了面前，用兩個手指揑她着的耳朶走向房裏去。她似乎是氣極了，眼睛裏露　兇光。她指首柳絲的前額說：</p>
<p>「說！你是誰的女兒？你家裏是做什麽事的？」</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>「說呀！爲什麽不說？」</p>
<p>「我不知道。」道是她的回答。</p>
<p>「好，你不說得了，反正我們已經知道。現在我給你說，你快點給我滚蛋，我們女學堂是不收婊子的。…一個婊子也來讀書，不要敎壞了别的孩子。」</p>
<p>她從學堂裏回家，一路走來，覺得很是傷心，於是她哭了。</p>
<p>婊子，現在是小婊子，將來大了更是婊子。……旣是婊子便不准讀書，這大概是一定不移的大道理。</p>
<p>店員通訊</p>
<p>倒有一半以上是從</p>
<p>不上課的學校</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>今年我由朋友的介紹，到法租界私立某中學裏讀書。這學校裏的課程表，倒也堂皇得很，與部頒標準，可說一點也没有違背。但是實際呢？倒有一半以上的鐘點，從不曾上課。我寳貴的求學時代，　見這樣地被他耽悮了。有一天我忍無可忍，就同校長大辦交涉，但是奇怪得很；他對我並不擺校長的架子，一味嘆没法。終究没有圓滿的答覆。先生，像這種學校，實在是誤人子弟；我因爲不平的心驅使，想同他大辦交涉，但是怎樣下手呢？請你指示我。此請撰安趙鵬謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：這件事情，要解决趙君個人的問题，非常容易。你不妨另外調一只内容切實，辦理認眞的學校裏去讀。好在愈是這種野鷄學堂，，收費方面，愈不肯減低。他寗願低首下心，受學心的氣，但錢的方面，是萬不能放鬆的。所以你調到别的學校裏去，經費方面，不致發生困難；别的也就好辦了。</p>
<p>不過這件事，趙君旣身歷其境，應當設法使以後的人，不再去受其愚。你應當將這學样裏的内容，詳詳細細的呈明市敎育局，必要時，你還要聯絡同學，出來做個證人，務須達到勒令停閉而後已。</p>
<p>在市敎育局方面，接到了這種呈文，必須切實調查，認眞辦理。即使因爲牠在租界裏，也要設法行使職權。收回租界敎育權，究竟比了收回租界，從易着手。要是在這一點不切實進行，那還有面子做局長嗎。</p>

<h3>電影在杭州</h3>
<p>— 傅敬嘉</p>
<p>西湖是國片外景的供給地</p>
<p>上海的電影發達極了，而他地呢？我想一定有人很樂於聽聞的罷？現在我就把杭州的電影事業向讀者報告一下：</p>
<p>在杭州的電影，我以爲可憐得很。這末大的一個商埠，純粹的電影院只有三家，不，其中有一家還有時做京劇或新劇的。</p>
<p>三家戲院中要算西湖大禮堂影戲院最好，地址在西湖裏，很幽靜的，風景也很好。院址是從前西湖博覽會時的大禮堂。開映的片子都是外國片，而且很陳舊的，間成開映國片，大部是聯華的出品。可是開映國片時價錢要貴一些。這戲院本來隸屬杭州電廠，後來才改爲商辦的。佈置得很好，建築也合於藝術化。可是離城遠，不大方便，尤其在夜裏。觀衆以學生居多，工人們是不大有的，如果在杭州的影戲院中說起來，這一家是可稱爲貴族化的。</p>
<p>次之的是城站的杭州影戲院。比西湖影戲院差一些，可是座價是不低的。開映的片子大部爲明星，間或開映些有聲的外國片，如龍虎鬭之類。每天開映二次。熱天的時候有時會减低價目，而且連映二部長片。觀衆以上中階級居多。</p>
<p>最可憐的是浙江大戲院，陳設恶劣，而且内部很不衛生有許多的觀衆是不肯進去的，開映些滑稽的陳舊的外國片。這家戲院常常改字號，常常換花樣的。牠也不能稱爲純粹的影戲院，可是在電影不發達的杭州，也只好讓牠佔領一席地了。</p>
<p>此外，還有一個大世界裏也有電影塲，可是都是些ＸＸ大俠，火燒ＸＸＸ等等的好片子，有時也會開映些殺人的小姐這一類的片子。</p>
<p>總之，杭州的電影事業是不發達的。可是杭州有一個優秀的西湖，所以拍外景都上杭州去的多。我們可以說杭州是電影外景的供給地。</p>
<h3>介紹滑稽片「拼命」</h3>
<p>— 愛蓮</p>
<p>自從快樂影片公司的「鷄鴨夫妻」問世以後，片子的本身雖不能不說是失敗的，但却也開了國産滑稽片的首創紀錄。於是劉春山在這三個月中，又攝了一張「拚命」。他鑒於自己對於電影事業生疏，所以這次他請了許多人帮忙。聞該片已經中央通過，不久公映。</p>
<p>牠是描寫一個敵國買通奸細，要擾亂中國地方，中國軍隊，一再「拚命」，用計陷敵，殺得他們片甲不歸。在拚命之中造成無數笑科，當然亭裏他一切都有所影射，含有極深的愛國意義。據說内中有大叚的二簧，每一叚都用新编的詞句，諷剌那簽定「買國條約」的主事人。前淸各種辱國媚外的大臣們，無一倖免。慷慨悲哥，異常動人。</p>
<p>這一張影片在攝製戰塲一幕的時候，因爲過於求逼眞了，所以用棉花塞實子彈。不料竟致傷三人，可見他們對於攝片時候的努力了。</p>
<p>至於滑稽方面，穿挿很多而以劉春山的成績，爲最使人滿意。試映的結果，亦較鷄鴨夫妻高明得多。其餘的話等到公映以後再談吧！</p>
<h3>宣景琳主演「前程」</h3>
<p>— 尹椿</p>
<p>自從「狂流」一片問世以後，明星公司的出品在劇本的意識上與演出的技巧上，差不多都有了顯明的進步。例如　近開映過的：「女性的呐喊」提出了婦女解放的口號，「道德　鑑揭破了僞道學者的假面具；不久將有一脂粉市塲」，揭示了現實社會中婦女職業問題的續結；而新近攝竣的「前程」，又提出了一個問題，女子嫁了人就算有了歸宿嗎？</p>
<p>中國歷來的傳統觀念，都以爲女人一嫁了丈夫，就有了歸宿，「終身定矣」。彷彿女子唯一的責任就是做「賢妻良母」似　，婦女運動在中國老是不能成功，這也可說是病根之一。「前程」抓住了這不大被人注意而却十分重要的問題。</p>
<p>該片導演者張石川君，在技巧上據說化了不少的心血，所以成績　好。主演的角色是重入明星的宣景琳女士，與新人明星的孫敏君，她們的表情都是靠得住的，在「前程」　總不會使我們失望吧？</p>
<h3>本埠銀訊一束</h3>
<p>— 愛蓮</p>
<p>好萊塢滑稽搭擋惠爾勒何爾塞二人于五月六日，乘上海丸到申後，即下榻華懋飯店。約十五日以前，將赴歐州。前往訪問者不多，而中國記者，則百無一人云。</p>
<p>白金龍被禁後，薛覺先心中殊悏悵。白金龍影片，擬在香港公　，因香港映權，中央無權過問也。又聞美國雷電華公司，已派駐華南經理向薛君接洽，請彼赴美攝片。薛因無興再演無台劇，故或能成爲事實也。</p>
<p>春潮影片，攝製已近一年，最近幾被中央禁映。惟略加删改後，已定五月底以前，在申公映。地點擬在新光或卡爾登云。</p>
<p>聞卡爾登自大光明映片起始，即將盡力爲國片集中地。第一片，將選明星公司之脂粉市塲。而聯合公司自製之「還我山河」亦於短時間中公映于卡爾登云。</p>
<p>敎育部積極籌辦之電影局，不久可成事實。唯該局經費將依仗電影界擔負之。據謂此後不論中外影片，檢查手續費及執照費，均爲增加四倍之巨云。</p>
<p>華北戰事片，最近將公映者，大約有三部。米高美，福斯，拍拉蒙（强生代拍）均係專員　來。此種實地影片，將與滬戰影片，同樣哄動一時云。</p>
<p>自下星期起，八仙橋靑年會禮堂于每星期中映通俗敎育影片，略收小洋二角以示限制。兒童或會員，則均半價。　　將在北京大戲院公映之聯華巨片「除夕」，據云其稿本係出諸羅明佑之手者。以總理而兼編劇，在中國尙屬第一次云。</p>
<p>天一公司自生機」完竣後，原擬開拍「黎明」，不料主角黎明暉認爲劇本不妥，故陳玉梅之黄昏，乃提前工作矣。</p>
<h3>「現代一女性」的春天半日</h3>
<p>— 文露</p>
<p>通告上明明地寫着：准一時出發到半淞園攝現代一女性外景遊潮，旁邊還畫着幾個圈子。</p>
<p>許久不曾到郊外，一直住在都會裏的我，心裏有一種說不出的悠然與欣喜，一切觸在眼　裏都呈露有生命的微笑。</p>
<p>汽車走到半路，塲記先生高步老霄又用他那京油子的嘴說了：「唉！我到了上海這麽些日子，連半淞園也没來過。」</p>
<p>我們的小鬍子導演李先生萍倩，帶着他慣用的滑稽口吻說：「没到過半淞園的，進來先要磕頭，不然回去去要瀉肚子的。」</p>
<p>「咦，又拿我們尋開心了。」</p>
<p>高步老霄把嘴一撇，表示着不信，等一會兒又裝傻地問：「眞的要磕頭麽？「那現代一女性」也没來過。」</p>
<p>我一聽他找到我的頭上來了：「我幾百輩子以前就來過了。」</p>
<p>「唉，說眞的，這麽好的春天，爲了工作而出來玩玩，眞是開心，開心。一說着他的嘴不住地翕動，好像在嘗這春的滋味。李萍倩正在唱他以前自己塡的詞。聽了他的話，看他嘴動的好笑，打趣地說：「春天來了，貓兒呌了，魚兒跳了。</p>
<p>「高步霄的臉破了。」我見高先生步霄的臉，因爲刮鬍子破了一大條，靑口的腮上印着鮮紅的痕，接着就說了這麽一句，說完忍不住哭了，李萍倩也哭了，他才知道我這一句話是跟着上文來的，他點着我吃吃地說：「你…你…你瞧，這小京油子，倒頂壞呀。」</p>
<p>「小京油子？京油子是頂不會說話的，京油子鬥不過衛嘴子，衛嘴子鬥不過豆皮兒，就是北平人鬥不過天津人，天津人鬥不過南方人。」（我意思是說，我是北平人，頂不會說話的。）</p>
<p>汽車到了。進門買票。我們不一會兒就找到早晨來拍「春水情波」的幾位同事。</p>
<p>滿園的桃花，妖艶　人，我同孫敏坐在船上，桃花籠罩着我們。拍在船上的戲，是再討厭不過了，船老是不聽指揮地在動，鏡頭自然不好對，結果船尾上繫了一根繩子，岸上用人拉着。</p>
<p>導演小鬍子說試一遍。。他告訴我們很快活地吃橘子，鏡頭很短，我們自然隨便做了。橘子給我吃，我又由他手裏拿了兩瓣遞到唇邊，他剛一張嘴，我就縮了回來。</p>
<p>哈，哈，他上了我一個當，我笑了，他却裝做生氣的樣子說：「花旦，你不可以這樣子。」</p>
<p>「我們正鬧着，忽然聽見一聲ＲＥＡＤＹＬ」我們很着這位風流導演（張邵兩先生送他的銜頭）的喊聲嚴肅了。</p>
<p>ＧＯＣＵＴ我們才恢復了自由。</p>
<p>五個鏡頭，拍了四個鐘頭。</p>
<p>我一個不留神，爲了翻轉身摟住孫敏。丨這是戲裏。一隻脚同水很親密的接了一個吻，濕淋淋地脚　正同接過吻的嘴唇一樣，只不過有一點冰凉的，怪不好受的。</p>
<p>回去了，汽車由辣斐德路的東頭向西飛駛，一路上看見許多擺灘賣舊貨的，以及各樣各式的勞動者。李萍倩感慨地說：</p>
<p>「一條長長的辣斐德路，却住着極相反的人物，絶對的環境，絶對的亨受：東段住的是勞動者，人商人，中間是小資産階級，西端却都是有大洋房，出入汽車的老爺太太們。</p>
<h3>電影界之新發明</h3>
<p>— 李科達</p>
<p>已廢底片之還原</p>
<p>攝製　影所用的底片因爲演員演技的不合，或是攝影時不留意，漏了光，從來差不多把它當做廢物了。它的價格每磅不過値二三角錢，一磅的ＦＩＬＭＥ差不多有六百尺以，而照月前的市價每呎總要二毛八分半左右。在各影片公司裏像這樣的損失是很多。</p>
<p>最近日本大阪工業試騐所安籐春藏氏發明了一種感光底片（卽用過的）再製的方法，經過了一年多的研究，方始告成。這個方法是把感好光的ＦＩＬＭＥ浸在特殊的沃度及臭素加里裏面，約一二分鐘，則底片感光的部份，因受沃渡及臭素水溶瓦斯作用　影，使未感光的臭化銀還原，再加上一番加感光的手續，則新的底片便完成了。</p>
<p>這樣的底片的生産費平均每呎約八九釐，（它的加工費爲五釐）。只低新ＦＩＬＭＥ價格的二十份之一，如此，豈不是電影界的大福音嗎，但願我國科學家亦努力研究，以俾對祖國有所貢獻。（缺章却酬）（完）</p>

<h3>電影小說秘密（ＳＥＣＲＥＴＳ）（三）</h3>
<p>— 開羅</p>
<p>威廉麥羅氣咻咻地立卽跑到家裏，把他的夫人女兒，及蘇笙呌了來。他將他女兒和他的妻妹痛斥了一頓，但他没有法子使她們二人心服誠悅，所以他就開始行使他家長的威權。他吩咐曼麗須與赫雷爵主急速結婚；兩天之内他們回英國去；未結婚之前，曼麗不准出門；不准與約翰卡頓通消息；倘使查出私通信息，立卽將那混蛋當衆鞭打，然後將他驅逐出境。這就是威廉麥米向他女兒所下的哀的美敦書。</p>
<p>到了夜間開跳舞會的時候，威廉麥羅就當衆宣布了曼麗和赫雷爵主行將結婚的消息，並且說赫雷後天同新婦乘了他的船回英國去。大家紛紛羨幕慶祝之間，約翰卡頓在窗外黑暗中的影子，已被曼魔看見了。他囑咐她的姨母去和他說呌他不要走，她就要見他。</p>
<p>一回兒約翰用長梯爬到曼麗臥房的窗口，曼麗把他接了進去。約翰告訴她，他明天就動身往西方去。他說她的父親辭了他而不給他證書，所以在新英格蘭已經没法尋事做，而祇好到加利福尼亞去碰機會了。他說他將來一定會發達的，那時再回來見她。請她放心。他這樣就和她告别了。但是曼麗死不放他走。她要跟他去，她求着他帶她一道去。約翰講給她聽；他這次西行，前途的艱難辛苦不少。亦許受凍挨餓。她是　閣小姐，從小嬌養慣的，恐怕吃不了苦。但是曼麗執意要去。她說但得約翰爲伴，生死都已置之度外，還怕吃什麽苦？</p>
<p>他們連忙更換衣裳。門外她的父親催着她爲什麽不出來，她連忙將約翰藏了起來，向她父親說不舒服，服衣睡覺了她父親說「你會脫衣服，就不會穿嗎？」曼麗於是就答應她父親十分鐘之内，一定就出來。她父親走了，曼麗和約翰就從窗口溜了出去，就此雙雙逃跑了。</p>
<p>威廉麥羅和赫雷爵主正在客廳的走郎上閒談着。赫雷說：「你的兒女嫁我，我已心滿意足，再無再快活的了。但是我至終懷疑着她自己情願不情願嫁給我。」威廉拍着他的肩膀道：」你放心。曼麗是最忠厚的女子，亦是能做你的最順從的妻子的。女孩子們總有些害羞了　」這時約翰和曼麗正騎了高大的脚踏車，從門前經過，但他們正在談話，没有看見他們。</p>

<h3>A Review and Prospect of "May Ninth"</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese forced the Yuan Shikai government to sign the Twenty-One Demands in the fourth year of the Republic of China, we have sought to wash away this national humiliation every year. Now, nineteen years have passed. Not only has the old humiliation not been eradicated, but new humiliations have been added, exceeding the original Twenty-One Demands by more than tenfold. Previously, regarding the joint operation of railways in the three northeastern provinces, the exploitation of mines and forests, and the loss of police rights, our country could still seek a peaceful solution and have a chance to save itself at leisure. But now, the three northeastern provinces have been plundered and even Hebei province has been forcibly occupied. We cannot even steal a moment's peace. Tracing the origin to the end, the recognition of the Twenty-One Demands on "May Ninth" planted the evil seed. However, the reason why this evil seed cannot be eradicated and is sinking deeper and deeper is that the government authorities of the past cannot evade their responsibility.</p>
<p>Although sovereignty in the Republic of China ultimately lies with the people, if the government is not clean and bright, if warlords cannot be stopped, and if corrupt officials and bureaucrats cannot be eliminated, the authorities in power should certainly be held responsible. But if the people abandon their own responsibilities and have no active and forceful representation to supervise their "public servants," then the blame lies with us, the people. However, there is a reason why our people have long adopted a laissez-faire attitude. Firstly, historical inertia runs too deep. From the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the present, politics, on the surface, has been dominated by Confucianism. In reality, the habit of "governing by doing nothing" is deeply rooted in the hearts of people throughout the country. Society in general also lacks vitality. Political struggle should originally be a struggle for enlightenment and the public good, but people instead admire deception, gradually leading to a situation where the gains and losses in politics only involve the rise and fall of individual power and positions, with little connection to the public. Customs become habits, and this has not changed for a thousand years. Once a foreign enemy invades and the authorities are weak, the people are also reduced to fish and meat. Secondly, our country is an agricultural nation. Although commercial operations developed early in their infancy, society in general still stubbornly clings to a handicraft industry state. Moreover, the intrusion of cheap goods from overseas, followed by the monopoly of financial capital, subjects the countryside to a double stripping from internal strife and external forces, leading to even greater ruin. Commerce, due to its immature technology and fragile organization, cannot transform into modern capitalism, forming a completely free and independent nation. Once a foreign enemy invades, how can it extricate itself?</p>
<p>The current government authorities cannot break through the current predicament and overcome the military aggression of Japanese militarism. This is almost a fact commonly acknowledged throughout the country. However, the people regard this deeply personal matter as if they were watching a fire from across the river. Will our country then be forever subjugated and dominated by imperialism? We dare to answer with a firm "no." The hard-working masses, who suffer the most and contribute the most, have learned great and lasting lessons from foreign insults and internal strife. They will certainly gradually awaken and think about expressing their inherent but yet unrevealed abilities. Take this current situation in various places along the Great Wall, struggling against Japan, as an example. All major cities and towns are indifferent to this national war, regarding it as if nothing is happening. However, the hard-working farmers in the villages near the front lines and in the Hebei countryside are mostly doing their utmost to support the soldiers facing the fire of cannons, even destroying their homes to rush to the aid of the country, without any hesitation. This is largely similar to the united hatred of the enemy in the Shanghai Battle. This proves the awakening of the masses. However, the thinking of people in agricultural societies has a particularly strong adhesive force, so their representation seems very conservative, and all actions seem slow and clumsy. It is certainly difficult to stand up and contend with modern science, industry, and capital. However, the honesty, courage, simplicity, hard work, and endurance of our people also have unique characteristics. Even in extremely dire circumstances, they can open up their own path. If scientific organization is added to coordinate from within, the magnitude of the collective force will certainly exceed what the world expects.</p>
<p>Therefore, the general public, in this difficult situation, may appear silent and without any expression regarding national affairs, but this is not true foolishness, nor is it true willingness to sit and await slaughter. Once the time is ripe, they will surely rise up with all their collective strength, uphold their sincere and persevering spirit, and unleash a vast national struggle. Continuing for ten or a hundred years, they will engage in a life-or-death battle with the Japanese warlords, who are driven by a temporary impulse for aggression, to strive for ultimate victory. This is what we hope for when looking to the future amidst the national humiliation of "May Ninth," and we deeply hope that our countrymen will strive for self-improvement.</p>
<p>(New York) A renowned American banker this evening explained the President's speech, saying that in the future, the United States will adopt a new approach to borrowing, at least for some time not issuing bonds guaranteed for gold payment. He also predicted that all government bonds in the future will be repaid in legal tender, but anticipated that bondholders will likely not sue in court, demanding repayment in gold. Currently, the gold repayment clause exists in approximately five trillion yuan of American public and private bonds, with the remainder scattered abroad. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Resolving War Debts</p>
<p>French Press Reports New American Proposal</p>
<p>(Paris) The notion reported by the Petit Parisien that the American White House has devised a new proposal to resolve war debts is now deemed completely unfounded by official circles here. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although official circles deem the new American proposal to resolve war debts reported by the Petit Parisien unfounded, other French newspapers believe this to be true, considering such a plan to be exploratory in nature. According to the Petit Parisien, the United States proposes that France should repay the debt principal in a lump sum, paying one-third in cash, one-third in public bonds, and the remaining one-third to be repaid in the future by the Bank for International Settlements.

<p>Tariff Truce</p>
<p>French Attitude Depends on Britain</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Herriot met with Commerce Minister Serre at 2:20 PM to discuss the Washington talks on the World Economic Conference and the tariff truce proposal. The French government undoubtedly agrees with the tariff truce in principle, provided that all countries can implement it. However, the tariff truce issue encounters difficulties in London. From this, people speculate that France's final decision on this matter may be delayed somewhat due to the British Cabinet's attitude. During his time in Washington, Herriot told the U.S. government that if the U.S. dollar depreciated excessively, France would implement additional tariffs to adjust the exchange rate difference. The French government will still follow this approach. As for the amount of exchange rate difference required to implement additional tariffs, it may be exemplified for reference. For example, if the Canadian currency depreciated to 22 francs, then goods imported from Canada to France would be subject to additional tariffs. After speaking with the Commerce Minister, Herriot declined to make any statements but said that he would leave Paris tonight, taking the 10:20 PM train to Lyon. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Japanese Reservation</p>
<p>Accepts Tariff Truce Proposal</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to responsible officials this morning, the Japanese government's response to President Roosevelt's tariff truce proposal was telegraphed to London on May 6. Japan agrees to the truce but attaches the reservation that it requires full agreement from the major powers and that any treaties Japan has signed with the powers that are incompatible with the truce and undermine the truce agreement should be deemed invalid.

<p>Responding to Zhang Xueliang's Telegram</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Goes to Rome</p>
<p>Berlin Ma Zhanshan, responding to Zhang Xueliang's telegram, suddenly departed for Rome today. Ma had been residing in a sanatorium here for a week due to a stomach ailment. He was originally scheduled to leave Germany tomorrow or slightly later, but immediately departed after receiving Zhang Xueliang's telegram invitation. The reason for the telegram summons was not disclosed. Upon receiving the news, German authorities immediately prepared train berths for Ma and his entourage of thirty people. According to Ma's spokesperson, the General's illness has improved. He will undertake a long journey, and the stomach ailment was caused by excessive banquets in Moscow, as the General is unaccustomed to Russian cuisine. After meeting with Zhang Xueliang in Italy, it is expected that he will soon return to China. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Pseudo Chairman of Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>Han Yunjie Not Imprisoned for Treason</p>
<p>The End of Traitors is Thus</p>
<p>(Changchun) In recent days, it has been widely rumored in this pseudo-official arena that Han Yunjie, the pseudo-chairman of Heilongjiang Province, has absconded with funds, and his family has also disappeared. It is also being said that the pseudo-chairman will be replaced. In reality, Han is currently imprisoned in the Japanese military police headquarters in Qiqihar, being interrogated because four million yuan remitted to Heilongjiang Province by the pseudo-Ministry of Military Affairs this spring has vanished without a trace, and over two million yuan in accounts are unexplained. He has been arrested by the Japanese military police. It is said that Han won the favor of the violent Japanese when the Japanese army launched a full-scale attack against Ma Zhanshan last year. Many soldiers under Cheng Zhiyuan refused to obey the violent Japanese, unwilling to slaughter their compatriots. At that time, Han used his private wealth to buy off bandits and assisted the tyrannical Japanese. Cheng was convicted by the Japanese for his troops not fighting, and Han won the favor of the Japanese and was recommended as pseudo-chairman. Cheng was harmed by Han, and today, both traitors are prisoners. The end of traitors can be described as extremely tragic. (China United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to local Japanese newspapers, the pseudo-organization issued a statement today, saying that regarding the bloody incident on December 7th of last year at 6:00 PM, when the former pseudo-chairman of Jilin Province, Cheng Zhiyuan, assassinated Han Yunjie's representative in Changchun, experts in nervous diseases have repeatedly determined that Cheng definitely has a nervous disease and is unaware of his actions. Therefore, the charge of murder cannot be established. He will be transferred to a mental hospital for permanent treatment solely due to his mental illness. (China United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Completion of Jihui Railway</p>
<p>Harbor Construction Plan in North Korea</p>
<p>The Port of Tsuruga, which is important for international transportation, completed construction work in Showa 3 (1928) after investing 4 million yen. However, on the North Korean side of the opposite shore, as the Jihui Railway has opened, the volume of products from North Manchuria exported through this route has gradually increased. Therefore, there is a plan to begin major harbor construction work at the Port of Rajin. In response to Rajin, Tsuruga has decided to invest 1 million yen in construction costs annually, beginning with expanding harbor construction. This plan has recently been approved and will be submitted to the 6th National Harbor Conference in Sendai on the 12th to seek recognition. The planned construction cost is 10 million yen. The newly built harbor includes various bays near Tsuruga and is very large in scale. (Japan United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>Pseudo-Councilor Komai Writes Book</p>
<p>Revisiting the Old Incident of Guo Songling's Rebellion Against Zhang Zuolin</p>
<p>Claiming He Participated in the Operation and Planning</p>
<p>Asserting Manchuria Would Have Been Autonomous Had Guo Succeeded</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Mr. Komai, a Japanese who currently serves as a Councilor in "Manchukuo," recently published a book in which he claimed that he did not wish to create an independent Manchuria and described his involvement in Guo Songling's rebellion in 1925. Komai recently gave an informal interview to a Reuters reporter, speaking about various points in his book. Komai said that what he initially planned was not the independence of Manchuria, but its autonomy. If his plan had succeeded when Guo Songling rebelled, the disturbances of the past nineteen months could have been avoided, and China, Japan, and "Manchuria" could now coexist in peace and amity. Guo's rebellion was the result of Guo's desire to liberate Manchuria and break away from Zhang Zuolin's corrupt politics. At that time, Wang Jingwei and Feng Yuxiang were both behind Guo, willing to provide assistance. If Guo had succeeded, Manchuria would have long been an autonomous region, willing to protect Japanese rights. He had strongly urged Japanese authorities in Manchuria to understand the true situation and not make things difficult for Guo, but the Japanese authorities unfortunately did not heed his words and instead sided with Zhang Zuolin. Zhang was defeated by Guo at that time, and at his wit's end, he promised rights to Japan. However, when the situation changed, Zhang ultimately went back on his word. The reporter asked that if Guo had succeeded, how could it be known that he would not go back on his word like Zhang. Komai said that he firmly believed that Guo Songling and Wang Jingwei could keep their word, although Feng Yuxiang could not be easily trusted. However, Wang and Guo could definitely fulfill the agreement from within. At that time, the Japanese authorities were deceived by Zhang's sweet words and hampered Guo, which was certainly reprehensible. However, Guo's failure and even his death were also his own fault, because he had urged Guo to use all of his 30 million yuan to win the hearts of the troops, but Guo did not heed his words, ultimately leading to disloyal troop morale. Zhang Zuolin, on the other hand, spent money like water to benefit others. In addition, the Japanese authorities did not allow Guo's army to pass through the South Manchuria Railway zone. Thus, Zhang defeated Guo, and the plan for Manchurian autonomy became a bubble. Otherwise, the Manchurian problem could have been resolved long ago in a manner similar to what was advocated in the Lytton Report. Why then would it have been necessary to mobilize troops to protect Japanese rights, and so on. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Requests Banking Sector</p>
<p>To Examine the Quality of New Currency</p>
<p>Jointly Organize Review Committee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Mint is minting new currency, increasing from over 30,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per day. It is expected that the maximum daily rate can reach over 100,000 yuan. The Ministry of Finance has requested the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and various foreign banks to jointly organize a review committee to examine the weight and quality of the new currency to determine whether it meets the standard of 88% silver and 12% copper. If there is any discrepancy, it will be melted down and recast. This committee will be established soon. Recently, several provincial and municipal chambers of commerce have suggested to the Ministry of Finance that the Hangzhou and Tianjin mints be restored to assist in minting currency. Due to financial and equipment concerns, the Ministry of Finance believes that it is difficult to consider and has shelved the proposal. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Jinan Reporter Group</p>
<p>Inspects Qingdao Municipal Administration Progress</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Jinan reporter group went to Qingdao yesterday to inspect the municipal administration and rural construction. They saw that the municipal government built residences for all the poor people in the city. Thieves, drug dealers, and opium addicts are all admitted to reformatories, so there are no beggars or bandits in the city. Traffic, automobiles, and schools are ubiquitous between villages in the countryside and in the valleys of Laoshan. Major villages have municipal hospitals, and smaller villages have itinerant treatment, all free of charge. Each village has an office of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, providing low-interest loans to farmers. All achievements are very good. However, the survey of the city's industry and commerce shows that Japan occupies half of it. In terms of capital, foreign businesses account for four-fifths. Most of the ships docked at the pier are Japanese ships. Chinese businesses suffered heavy losses due to the stagnation of exports of local goods last year. The municipal government is now making every effort to provide assistance, giving Chinese merchant ships various conveniences and reducing pier taxes, but the number is very small. It cannot be saved without the central government appropriately reducing tariffs. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>International Trade Bureau</p>
<p>Promoting Chinese Tea Exports to Russia</p>
<p>Dispatching Li Zejin to Negotiate with Russian Merchants</p>
<p>Tea is a major export commodity of our country, with annual exports around one million dan (a unit of weight). In recent years, due to competition from Indian and Ceylonese tea, Chinese tea has plummeted. Russia is our country's largest tea market. Since the cessation of relations between China and Russia, the sales of Chinese tea have dropped from 300,000 boxes to about 30,000 boxes, a tenfold difference. Now that China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations and formal trade between the two countries has begun, Chinese tea can restore its lost market and sell well in Soviet Russia. However, our exporting tea merchants lack capital and organization, making foreign trade particularly difficult. In order to promote the export of Chinese tea to Russia and develop trade with Russia, the International Trade Bureau has specially dispatched Li Zejin, director of the Guidance Department, to Shanghai to meet with the manager of the Soviet Russian Aid Association foreign firm to negotiate and study methods for exporting Chinese tea to Russia. This not only provides assistance to our country's exporting tea merchants, but also has a significant impact on trade with Russia. Last Two Days</p>
<p>Three People Drown Themselves in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>丨Resulting in One Death and Two Survivors丨</p>
<p>Between the night before last and yesterday, three young men successively boarded boats and drowned themselves in the Huangpu River, resulting in one death and two survivors. Details of each incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>With a Long Sigh</p>
<p>Around 10:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young man of about sixteen or seventeen years old, wearing a white cloth shirt and pants, bald and without a hat, boarded sampan number 1248 at the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, stating that he wanted to cross to the Tongren Wharf on the opposite bank. The sampan rower, Xin Xiaogen, immediately cast off the mooring line and rowed towards the center of the Huangpu River. Unexpectedly, upon reaching the middle of the river, the young man suddenly walked to the bow of the boat, let out a long sigh, and jumped into the river to take his own life. Xin, seeing the situation, became anxious and tried to rescue him with a bamboo pole, but the young man's body never resurfaced, making it impossible to save him. Xin, helpless, reported the incident to the Customs Water Police Station for record.</p>
<p>A Bitter Smile on His Face</p>
<p>Xu Jiufu, a native of Ningbo, currently 25 years old, worked as a shop assistant at the Yuantai Clothing Store on Fujian Road. Yesterday morning, he suddenly left the store alone and went to the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession. He boarded the company's 11:30 AM express ferry to cross the river to Pudong. When the ferry reached the middle of the river, Xu, taking advantage of people's inattention, leaped into the turbulent waves, intending to take his own life. The ferry's captain, Zhao Dasheng, immediately turned the ferry around to attempt a rescue. Fortunately, nearby boatmen managed to rescue him and hand him over to the Customs Water Police Station. Zhao reported the details of the rescue. According to Xu's statement, both his parents had passed away, and he was in dire financial straits. He had previously been favored by Mr. Zhou, the owner of a certain clothing store, who promised his daughter, Lin Di, in marriage to him. Now that the man is grown and the woman is of age, they should have married early, but he lacks the means and feels ashamed in front of relatives and friends, so he would rather die to eliminate the shame. Three suicide notes were found on his person, all stating the idea of ​​despair due to lack of money for marriage, with extremely sad language. The police station immediately dispatched officers to bring his fiancée, Zhou Lin Di, to the police station. Upon seeing Xu, Lin Di immediately questioned her fiancé as to why he would resort to such measures. Xu had a bitter smile on his face, replying that he had nothing to say. The engaged couple appeared quite intimate. The police chief ordered them to go home together.</p>
<p>Seemingly Poisoned</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM yesterday, the small ferry of the Longmao foreign firm in Lujiazui, Pudong, was carrying passengers from Puxi back to Pudong when suddenly a young man jumped into the Huangpu River to take his own life. At that time, the Xinfei Yu small ferry happened to be passing by. The captain of that ferry, Gu Zhanglin, noticed this and immediately stopped the engine, trying to rescue him. It was found that due to excessive drinking, the youth had already fainted and lost consciousness and was sent to the Customs Water Police Station. After the police station personnel used artificial respiration to revive him, fresh blood flowed from the youth's mouth, as if he had taken poison before jumping into the river. For a long time, he could not be revived. The police chief, helpless, ordered patrolman Gu Wenkui to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. For One Copper Coin</p>

An argument arose over one copper coin. Initially, they argued verbally, then resorted to violence. Yang used a kitchen knife to cut Zhu on the head and arms, causing him to fall to the ground and call for help. Cai Zhitian, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road police station, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, arresting the assailant Yang Chaosheng, along with the murder weapon, and taking him back to the police station. The injured Zhu was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The next morning, Yang was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, judge Xiao Xie fen of the Special Court opened the court for continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, saying that the injury suffered by the victim, Zhu Wenkui, was on the left hand bone, which had been fractured, resulting in a disability. The hospital doctor had confirmed this with an X-ray examination and taken a photograph, which was then presented for inspection. Zhu Wenkui then testified that at the time, the dispute arose from playing mahjong, and he was cut twice on the head and twice on the left arm with a kitchen knife, resulting in a bone fracture. He requested a thorough investigation. The defendant pleaded guilty, saying that Zhu's wife had slapped him in the face. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Xiao ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody and scheduled a future examination of the victim's arm bone by the court's forensic doctor for further verification.</p>

During the inspection, a passenger, about 25 or 26 years old, wearing a blue cloth long gown and a gray woolen copper pot hat, wanted to enter the station to take the train. At that time, patrolman Guo Eryong of the Gaochangmiao Police Station and patrolman Jin Zhongfu of the Chenjiaqiao Branch Police Station of the Second District Public Security Bureau, seeing his suspicious behavior, stopped him for inspection. Unexpectedly, the passenger in the blue cloth long gown was a bandit. He claimed to be helping. Policeman Jin replied that he was handling official business according to regulations.

<p>Special Article</p>
<p>Attorney Zhang Xingyan, regarding the Chen Peng case, has refuted the Central Daily News editorial "Today's China's Country and Government." He wrote an article and submitted it to this newspaper for publication. Now, the Central Daily News has written another article in response to Zhang's article, instructing this newspaper to publish it as well. It is specially disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Re-Discussing Today's China's Country</p>
<p>And Government Central Daily News</p>
<p>In the past, on the day when the Chen Peng treason case was publicly tried in court, the reporter, based on legal principles and current laws, solemnly raised the question of today's China's country and government in the Chen Peng's confession and lawyer Zhang Shizhao's defense for the world forum, slightly correcting right and wrong and clarifying black and white. Since the ignorant theory was published in this newspaper, Zhang Shizhao submitted an article to the Shanghai Shenbao, titled "The Kuomintang and the Country." The main points of the article mostly referred to the previous editorial of this newspaper. The reporter believes that the previous article was purely based on academic principles and laws. In addition to correcting and defending the fallacies in Zhang Shizhao's defense from the perspective of academic theory and law, it did not involve the interest of this topic at all. Now, after observing the paper published by Zhang Shizhao in Shenbao, there are still things to explain in the various points discussed in the article. However, looking at the whole article and the tone of the language, the aggressive spirit and messy words fill the lines, which have overflowed the barriers of the argument. If Mr. Zhang talks about the constitution, he must crown it with "the so-called constitution," and when it comes to this party, he names it "power party." He measures the motive of the previous editorial of this newspaper, saying that it resonates with the court's judgment, and goes on to say, "The Central Daily News is burdened by the party to tend, and its intention is to kill and seize people." All these words are used to show his ridicule and humiliation. Mr. Zhang's personal past, which can be criticized and humiliated by the world for future generations, has the world and future generations. Mr. Zhang's actions in the past 20 years, which have been used as a place for statistical analysis of right and wrong for a hundred years, have statistics after a hundred years. In the past, Mr. Zhang stumbled north and south, burdened by his ambitions. The views of the world and future generations also have their own views. We will never imitate Mr. Zhang's faults today and rashly attack Mr. Zhang outside of the argument. I occasionally remember that on the day when Mr. Zhang went to court in Beijing to argue and returned to Shanghai, he made a conversation in Shanghai and said that the government authorities did not prevent him from defending his words at all. All the newspapers inside and outside the party in Beijing also gave him as much coverage as possible without missing a word. Mr. Zhang regarded the government's defense as unfounded in interfering with speech. Mr. Zhang's thoughts are all known to the discerning people in the world, and it is not what the reporter wants to add a word. The reporter must still maintain the tolerant attitude of this party from beginning to end to discuss the issue of country and government with Mr. Zhang, because Mr. Zhang claims to be a scholar, and he cannot bear to let him be confused and ignorant of the nature of the country and government in which he lives.</p>
<p>The training government's promise to formulate laws is the National Assembly. According to the election law of the National Assembly, the National Assembly is composed of representatives elected by the people of the whole country and representatives of the Kuomintang. The representatives of the National Assembly are not restricted by any party affiliation. As Mr. Zhang said in his article, Mr. Zhang has recognized that the representatives of the National Assembly are not restricted by party affiliation, then it is not difficult to see from the wording that he recognizes that the National Assembly is composed of representatives of the people of the whole country.

<h3>The Stupid Ox on the Guangshao Road</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Wheels rumble, ox toils: car travels fast, ox's life ends quick!  Escaped child herds, ox collides with axle; horns strike, car veers; car nearly flips, ox is slaughtered! Horns broken, belly torn; legs severed, blood and flesh remain! This is a strange tale of an ox hitting a train and causing a derailment on the Guangshao Road, which I have summarized into a three-character poem, each line rhyming with the "entering tone" "wu," "wo," and "jiao." The story behind this poem is as follows: Last month, on April 26th, the 17th freight-passenger mixed train on the Guangshao Road departed from Xin Jie Station.  As it approached the 141st marker, about two hundred paces from Xicun Station, a water buffalo weighing over three hundred catties suddenly jumped onto the tracks in front of the train from a paddy field in the lychee orchard to the east of the road. It desperately ran north, seemingly wanting to be the vanguard of the train, or perhaps to race it. However, the ox ran fast, but the train ran even faster, and the train was about to catch up from behind. In this critical situation, the cowherd tried his best to stop the ox, but the ox continued to rush forward. The cowherd had no choice but to abandon the ox and retreat to the field. When the locomotive arrived, it crushed the stupid ox under the axle! This train was not carrying much cargo, but the ox was large and its two horns happened to be propped up on the steel rails, causing both the freight car and the dining car to derail. Fortunately, no people or goods were damaged, only twenty-four railroad ties were broken. The stupid ox, however, was pitiful! Both horns were broken, both ears were severed, there was a large hole in its head, its front hooves had been subjected to the punishment of foot amputation, and its belly was split open like a cut pomegranate. Undigested grass from its stomach was scattered beside the tracks. This incredibly stupid ox suffered a truly tragic death!</p>
<p>Stupid ox, how could you keep up with the speed of a train? Running after a train was already overestimating your abilities, let alone trying to lead it! The ox died because of its "unbelievable stupidity." In the end, it only left its frantically devoured and undigested stomach grass scattered along the roadside. Stupid ox! Stupid ox! You can serve as a lesson for those who are boastful and ignorant!</p>
<h3>Just Hoping</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>I do not dream that our country's higher education will be as successful as in Europe and America, or that compulsory education will be as widespread as in Denmark. I only hope that every university student wearing a square hat can write a clear and coherent letter home, and that the illiterate population of the country will not increase to one hundred percent.</p>
<p>I do not dream that our country will still be the world's leading agricultural power. I only hope that in the future, we will not have to import grain from overseas in a continuous stream.</p>
<p>I do not dream that our country's industry will be as innovative and widespread as Germany's. I only hope that we can manufacture some of the pen nibs I am holding to write, instead of having to use these infuriating foreign goods.</p>
<p>I do not dream that merchants will rise up and boycott enemy goods. I only hope that they will not secretly replace some domestic goods with enemy brands to sell, and when the anti-Japanese situation becomes tense, they will not switch enemy goods back to domestic brands to sell.</p>
<p>I do not dream that all doctors can cure all kinds of diseases. I only hope that they will not practice medicine recklessly and kill people.</p>
<p>I do not dream that all four hundred million of our compatriots will go to fight the Japanese. I only hope that pro-Japanese traitors will not emerge in endless numbers, harming our compatriots and making us a laughingstock to foreigners.</p>
<p>Finally, I do not dream that all these hopes of mine will be fully realized. I only hope that there is some possibility of realizing a few of them.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>Red is flamboyant, yellow is solemn, white is elegant, green is graceful, black is composed. Blue is a combination of red and green; therefore, it is both flamboyant and graceful. Purple is a combination of red and black; therefore, it is both flamboyant and composed. Colors can cure diseases and can also test a person's personality.</p>
<p>Money is the monosodium glutamate of the material world, and women are the monosodium glutamate of the spiritual world; the same seasoning, but with vastly different flavors.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "A scholar dies for someone who understands him, and a woman adorns herself for someone who appreciates her." In reality, nowadays, there are few scholars willing to die for someone who understands them, but women's adornments are everywhere!</p>
<p>The ancients also said: "To have one true friend in life is enough." In reality, nowadays, how easy is it to find a true friend? There are only friends in wine and meat; where are friends in adversity? Tao Yuanming took chrysanthemums as his confidants, Zhou Maoshu took lotuses as his confidants, Pi Rixiu took peaches as his confidants, Wang Xizhi took geese as his confidants, and Duke Xian of Jin took cranes as his confidants. Isn't it because people's confidants are not easy to find?</p>
<h3>Trivial Tales of Longhua</h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>Longhua is originally a very ordinary rural town, but to Shanghai residents who have long lived in the city, it is considered a scenic spot just like Wusong Fort and Taiwan.</p>
<p>A dilapidated Longhua Temple with several statues of Buddha covered in sparrow droppings actually attracts many wealthy tycoons and white people. Modern ladies in short sleeves and long gowns, high heels, and leather shoes are also vying to bow and kneel, murmuring prayers and drawing lots, activities that are the complete opposite of dancing and playing golf.</p>
<p>Only a pessimist who is tired of the world and hates俗世, or a monotheist who repents of sins, would shave their head and take vows to avoid the mundane world and seek refuge in the Pure Land, fearing only that the mountains are not deep enough. However, the monks in Longhua Temple have no choice but to deal with these ordinary people, even very sensual modern women, chanting "Amitabha" while calculating in their hearts. I do not know when they will be able to escape the sea of suffering and be born on the other shore!</p>
<p>There is a Shanghai Orphanage here that shelters orphans. Inside, there are classrooms, auditoriums, dormitories, gardens, display rooms, and craft workshops. The number of male and female students reaches three to four hundred, but only about ten percent of them have their food, clothing, and shelter provided by the orphanage. It cannot accommodate as many orphans as possible, supposedly due to the lack of fixed and regular funding. Students spend half a day studying and half a day working. Their innocent and cheerful faces seem to welcome us to visit. The craft courses include embroidery, rattan work, bamboo work, woodwork, and shoemaking, and the completed items are displayed in the showroom. They are exquisite and ingenious, indistinguishable from those sold in the market. According to Mr. Jin, who guided our tour, they are actively seeking development, but few people are willing to invest in this kind of unpromising事業. I am afraid they will end up "things going against their wishes." Indeed, this limited area of the orphans' colony needs to be developed by wealthy philanthropists. A Longhua known as a "scenic spot" only has this one thing worth noting.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Cen Yunjie</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The death of Liang Yansun was still causing a stir in the newspapers when news of Cen Yunjie's passing arrived. Time flows like this, and I cannot help but lament the withering of elder statesmen. Yunjie's courtesy name was Chunxuan, and he was known as Cen Xilin, a practice of associating a person with a place name, following the examples of Weng Changshu and Li Hefei. He successively held the positions of Gansu Financial Commissioner, Shaanxi Governor, Governor-General of Liangguang, Governor-General of Sichuan, and Minister of Posts and Communications. Since the Republic of China, he once served as President of the Protectorate Government. He was strict and uncompromising in his dealings, and was respected and feared by both the court and the public. However, he was very kind to his subordinates and remained consistent throughout his life. It is said that he had two staff members named Cen Shen and Zhang Mingqi, both of whom he trusted and were known as the Two Worthies. However, Shen was indifferent to fame and fortune, while Mingqi was quite enthusiastic about seeking advancement. Cen always recommended Shen first, but Shen declined, citing his own mediocrity. Cen recommended him more than a dozen times, but Shen's heart never wavered. Cen deeply admired his high aspirations. Shen also appreciated Cen's understanding and followed him for life. Mingqi initially handled correspondence for Cen, then took leave to take the鄉試, and later paid for an official position. When Cen was promoted to Governor of Shanxi, he recommended him for the position of intendant. After Cen quelled the rebellion of bandits in Sichuan, he again requested that he be awarded the title of卿, to assist with military affairs, but this was opposed by the Grand Council and could not be fulfilled. Later, when Cen was Governor-General of Liangguang, he strongly recommended him, and he was appointed Circuit Intendant of Taiping Sishun, acting Financial Commissioner. When a certain Governor of Jiangxi left office, Mingqi succeeded him by imperial order, achieving a prominent position and shaking the world. Cen's promotion of him was like this. It is said that Cen's ancestors were soldiers in Guangxi, and many were famous generals. Cen was a descendant of Duke Xiangqin and practiced archery from a young age. When icicles formed from leaks in the eaves on cold days, Cen would shoot them with arrows, hitting them every time, not letting Yang You monopolize the reputation of hitting willow leaves. Therefore, when he attacked the Guangxi bandit Lu Afa, he wore a short battle skirt and mingled among the soldiers, shooting and killing enemies. Lu Afa feared him like a god, as he himself had almost been shot to death. In recent years, Cen has been a resident of Shanghai, not involved in politics, and spending his days behind closed doors, seeking solace in books. Unexpectedly, he died of a stroke at the age of seventy-three. Cen was the third child, and his family called him Third Master.</p>
<p>Social Sketches</p>
<h3>Shanghai Mornings</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>The prelude to this article will always carry some mysterious and romantic colors, especially at night, which shows a strong intensity. The Shanghai Night Talk written by Zhang Ruogu is this kind of sketch. His lively and agile pen is full of art and love, which is really admirable.</p>
<p>The morning in Shanghai is quiet, dormant, and certainly not as exciting as the night. But don't assume that the smell of wood chips in the alleys, the garbage trucks on the streets, and the male and female coolies in front of the factories are representative of Shanghai's mornings. There are indeed several kinds of innocence and simplicity that are worth pondering. However, few people in the city get up at dawn. Therefore, the appreciation of this morning must be left to the following types of people.</p>
<p>The Flower Market at Nanyang Bridge. There are no New Year red electric lights here, no jazz music, no thighs and long eyebrows, and no rouge and powder. In the misty dawn, sometimes against the remnants of the morning star and waning moon, sometimes relying on the weak streetlights, stalls are lined up on both sides of the road, and all kinds of flowers and trees compete for beauty, like a treasure competition. In the spring, peonies are as proud as princes; peach blossoms are as coquettish as dancers; orchids are as pure as village girls. In the summer, roses have the faces of fairies, emitting a strong fragrance; jasmine and white orchids are like meat-selling girls, desperately enticing passers-by. In autumn and winter, chrysanthemums, daffodils, and wintersweets are displayed in turn. The noisy road immediately becomes a land of myriad fragrances, a kaleidoscope of flowers. As the red sun gradually rises, the flower market closes, and the city returns to its hustle and bustle,煩惱, filth...all kinds of faces.</p>
<p>I have to visit this flower market once a week. Why? With the country in this state, I have long been prepared to be a亡國奴! But I refuse to admit defeat and follow the fashion of shouting "Mahjong saves the country!" "Old wine saves the country!" Every Saturday night, I gather with a few comrades to play mahjong and drink a few catties of old wine, diligently doing this work of saving the country. After finishing these two tasks, it is almost dawn, and I cannot sleep soundly, so I stroll to this flower market. Looking at the flowers and smelling the fragrances can invigorate my tired spirit. So, I added another task called "Watching flowers saves the country." The Bird Gathering. Beside the racetrack and next to Tibet Road, a low iron fence surrounds a vast lawn, which is the racetrack that everyone knows. During the horse racing season in spring and autumn, the narrow sidewalks are crowded with Shandong men showing peep shows, selling pear paste candy while singing ditties, and all kinds of snacks, like a temple fair. Usually, in the afternoon or evening, if the weather is fine, there are also beggars begging and various peddlers, which everyone also knows. The bird gathering I am talking about happens in the early morning. All bird owners bring their birdcages to gather here. Let these small prisoners in cages absorb some fresh air and tell their grievances to their fellow birds. Rows of iron fence tops are covered with birdcages, as if it were a bird show. They call it "Chong Niao" (Washing Birds). Caged birds bathe this way every day, and their feathers become brighter, their voices become clearer, and their value increases. The birds that are brought here to bathe are among the following: the small and delicate eye-ringed bird; the thrush with painted white eyebrows; and the lark, which is articulate like a musician. The songs of these birds are naturally melodious and pleasing, so people are willing to raise and play with them. I asked a few bird owners, "The quality of the birds depends entirely on the number of rings they can sing in a row. Good birds can sing more than a dozen rings in a row, which are worth about a hundred yuan."</p>
<p>Originally, raising birds, from the perspective of scholars, is "playing with things and losing ambition." But taking this opportunity to practice getting up early is not without its benefits.</p>
<p>Raising birds is originally an impractical thing, but our country raises millions of soldiers, and what good are they? It is better to raise a few birds, and they will give you some wonderful songs to listen to every day.</p>

<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Sweet and Bitter Love Field, Coldly Observing Both Sides; Rugged Worldly Path, Secret Agreement for Three Years</p>
<p>As soon as he stepped out of the gate, Guan Yaowu's twelve-year-old eldest son walked up to greet him, called out "Uncle" twice, and then reached out to Guan Yaowu and said, "Dad, give me a few cents so I can play." Guan Yaowu scolded, "You're such a big kid, all you know is how to play. Your mother took my wallet, where am I going to get the money?" The child stretched out his hand, and was so startled by his father's scolding that he almost couldn't pull it back. Zhao Ziqiang quickly took out a dollar from his pocket and stuffed it into his hand, laughing, "It's New Year's, children always want to play, why scold him?" Guan Yaowu laughed, "I'm not scolding the child, but when I think about it carefully, I can't help but complain. Think about how we work so hard to earn money and bring it home, and it's all used by others, what's the point?" Yin Deren said, "For the sake of supporting your family, what's not to understand?" Guan Yaowu said, "What's so good about supporting a family?" Yin Deren said, "Raising a wife, a wife can give you sons and daughters. Raising sons and daughters, when they grow up, they can support you." Guan Yaowu said, "Is that true? I don't know now whether my children will support me in the future. If you're talking about marrying a wife and having children, I've had quite a few now, what's so good about it? The older ones want money, the younger ones make me puke yellow bile." Zhao Ziqiang laughed, "Then why did you get married in the first place?" Guan Yaowu, walking along the road, took off his hat with his left hand and rubbed his head several times with his right hand, revealing his hesitant appearance, and laughed, "I can't say either. I only remember that when I didn't have a wife, I looked at people who had wives and wanted one myself. Now that I have a wife, I keep thinking about the benefits of not having married a wife back then." Zhao Ziqiang said, "People are all like that, it's not just you." As they were talking, they unconsciously reached the streetcar stop. Just as everyone was about to get on the streetcar, they saw Tian Qing, arm in arm with the Ms. Huang Manying who had just gone to drink coffee with him, getting off the streetcar. They met head-on and could not avoid each other, so they had to greet each other. Zhao Ziqiang said, "We went to Brother Guan's house and came out again, did you drink coffee until this late?" Tian Qing said, "No, we took a detour. The three of you are going back to Haidian, I have something to do, I'll come in a while." After speaking, he gave a military salute and immediately followed the woman away. Watching them from afar, they walked side by side, laughing and talking by the roadside. (64)</p>

<h3>Irresponsible Tanks</h3>
<p>— He Jia Gan</p>
<p>Recently, the newspapers reported that the people of Jiangxi saw tanks for the first time. Naturally, the people of Jiangxi are very fortunate. However, there are also people who are worried that they will have to dig into their pockets again to donate to the tank fund. I am reminded of another matter:</p>
<p>A man claiming to be surnamed "Zhang" once said, "I am a supporter of the lack of freedom of speech... Precisely because there is no freedom of speech, good articles can be produced. The so-called 冷嘲, irony, humor, and other 文體 forms of writing that are afraid to take responsibility for their words all arise under oppression and suppression." I wonder how this so-called irresponsible文體 compares to tanks?</p>
<p>Why sarcasm and the like are irresponsible, I do not know. However, I have heard people argue for many years about how "satirical remarks" are not right and how "sneak attacks" kill genius. Since it has been going on for many years, it seems to be very reasonable. Generally speaking, it is scolding people for not daring to be heroes and for lacking courage. In fact, hiding behind thick sheets of iron, in tanks, and bombing away is certainly much more enjoyable, although it does not seem very courageous either.</p>
<p>The upper classes have always been good at hiding behind thick things to kill people. In ancient times, there were thick city walls to guard against bandits and rebels. Now there are steel vests, armored cars, and tanks. Even the laws that protect the "Republic" and private property are always thick volumes. Even the coffins of the Emperor and his officials are thicker than those of commoners. As for the thickness of the skin, it is also in accordance with ancient propriety.</p>
<p>Only the lower classes have to defend themselves in this way. They will be ridiculed for being "irresponsible" and the like:</p>
<p>"Do you dare to come out? Come out! It doesn't count as being a hero to make sarcastic remarks from behind!"</p>
<p>However, if you fall for his trick and really rush to the front lines bare-chested, acting like 讦褚, he will immediately give you a shot, without being polite, and then, imitating Jin Shengtan's style of criticizing the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, scold you, "Who told you to be bare-chested?" You deserve it." In short, whether you live or die, you are guilty.</p>
<p>It can be seen that it is really difficult to be a human being, and it is much easier to be a tank.</p>
<h3>Aviation Saves the Nation</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>Every time May arrives, I cannot help but think of the past May Fourth, May Ninth, and May Thirtieth Movements. These usually start out with a lot of excitement, attacking national traitors, marching, demonstrating, boycotting markets, and striking, and the situation is very tense. Later, some clever people see that the situation is too tense and come up with "Railroad Redemption Funds," "National Salvation Funds," or "Patriotic Funds," etc., to resolve the crisis. So some people think that since donating a dollar or two can save the country, there is no need to go to the trouble of running errands or shouting slogans; and some people who cannot even afford to donate a dollar or two are not qualified to save the country, so they have to shut up. Thus, the initial轰轰烈烈 situation cools down, although the destination of those funds is usually never known.</p>
<p>However, this was during the era of the Beiyang government. The current "National Government" is supported by both the Japanese government and the people, so the situation is naturally different. When the guns of September 18th sounded, the Northeast quickly became "old territory." At first, there were some petitions and the like to decorate the scene, but the government initially asked the people to remain calm. Some people therefore remained very calm. The "business community" opposed market boycotts, saying that this was a harmful and useless thing. There were also people coming out to advocate for domestic goods. As for the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association," etc., which were enough to "astonish friendly nations," they were "automatically" sealed up. All national salvation work was originally very calm. Only the guns and planes of Japanese imperialism were still not willing to be calm. Today they attack Shanghai, tomorrow they attack Rehe, and there are also Luandong, Tianjin, and Chahar. It seems that as long as there is still a piece of land left in China, they will not be calm for a day. The very calm national salvation work is also somewhat restless. For example, the "business community" that opposed market boycotts had to close its doors on January 28th, and strikes, class boycotts, armed forces, etc., were even more out of control. Good, now someone is coming out to speak. The reason why the Northeast was沦亡, why Tianjin was in danger, and why China was invaded was not because of anything else, but entirely because China did not have enough airplanes. Good, let's donate money to buy airplanes. At this time, they came up with "Aviation Saves the Nation." That aviation can save the nation is proven by the fact that those important people who are in charge of party and state affairs all ride in Ford planes. Therefore, to save the country, all you have to do is donate some money, and those who cannot donate money are naturally not worthy of talking about saving the country. As for whether "Aviation Saves the Nation" is a copy of the old articles of "Railroad Redemption Funds," "National Salvation Funds," or "Patriotic Funds," that remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Qu Lu Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhan</p>
<p>(Twenty-Five) How Easy Is It to Talk?</p>
<p>At the Qu Lu discussion, guests gathered, and the discussion touched upon the scope of recent Free Talk articles. The editor intended to avoid politics, with the intention that in a well-governed world, the common people should not discuss affairs of state. I jokingly broke the topic, saying: "How easy is it to talk? According to this, it cannot be called freedom." Guest A said, "That is not so. The party rule is wise and enlightened, and cannot be said to be without governance. The protection of civil rights is already guaranteed. Freedom of speech is enshrined in law; there is no lack of famous writers who can enrich the nation with their writing. Who says that frank and high-minded discourse is not tolerated in today's world?" Guest B said, "The example of the Yin dynasty is not far off, during the time of the Xiahou dynasty. When the government is not righteous, wolves and jackals are in power. The anti-Japanese war is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and a treaty of ceding territory and paying indemnities is eventually concluded. Even those who advocate protecting the emperor, like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, cannot deny this. At first, they published Qingyi Bao, and then Xinmin Congbao, attacking the Qing court. Published in foreign lands, they swept the motherland. The accumulated resentment was difficult to contain once it erupted. Protecting the emperor, but the imperial family was not protected in the end, fitting the vulgar saying that one helps only to hinder. Yan Fu said that the Qing Dynasty was not destined to perish, but it was destroyed by Liang Qichao's pen. I think that Master Yan only saw the failure of Kang and Liang's protection of the emperor, but did not know that the Qing court's diplomatic failures and the people's grievances took advantage of it, leading to the destruction of the country. Therefore, we dare to assert: at that time, the one that harmed the Great Qing Empire and overturned its so-called country was the Qing court itself. Although there were many希望党人, suppressing public opinion only increased the people's resentment and hastened its demise." I said, "You are right. In the late Zhou dynasty, the dukes were unbridled, and hermits could only offer 横议; in the Southern Song dynasty, the Jin barbarians were rampant, and scholars could only offer狂言. What time is it now? Are there no changing dukes among those who are unbridled? Are there Jin barbarians among those who are rampant? But now, the hermits and scholars can only offer 横议狂言. The tongues and pens of literati are only so-so, why should they be feared? The dukes do not yet have Qin's policies, and the tragedy of burning books and burying scholars may not be seen again; the enemy country is cunning like the Jin people, but it is still forced to ban the words of those who call for resisting the barbarians and advocating war. Fortunately, the small Southern Dynasty has Emperor Xiaozong at the top, and scholars like Chen Liang and Ye Shi can vent their pent-up anger with 狂言, without being forced to rebel. Therefore, although the traitor Qin Hui was able to achieve his ambitions, it was not enough to talk about revenge and vengeance, but its national诈, was able to survive for a hundred years. The late Qing government was not wise enough to understand this, and did not hesitate to sell out the country to foreigners, while oppressing and killing their own slaves without mercy. After the 甲午庚子, they enjoyed the country for only ten years. Is that not appropriate?" Before I finished speaking, the whole audience sighed endlessly.</p>
<h3>Red Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— By Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Bathing</p>
<p>When it was almost four o'clock, Red Carrot Whiskers enthusiastically woke Lei Pik and his older brother Felix, who were sleeping under the hazelnut trees in the garden.</p>
<p>"Shall we go?" he said.</p>
<p>Felix: Then let's go. Did you bring your shorts?</p>
<p>Lei Pik: I'm afraid it's still too hot at this time.</p>
<p>Felix: As for me, I like to go when there is still sun.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers: Besides, Dad, you'll be more comfortable sleeping by the river than here. You can sleep on the grass.</p>
<p>Lei Pik: Then you go first, slowly, don't rush and get overheated.</p>
<p>But Red Carrot Whiskers had to exert a lot of effort to slow down. He felt like ants were biting his feet. He carried his ugly, plain shorts and his older brother Felix's shorts with red and blue stripes on his shoulder. He chatted happily, sang to himself, and jumped over the low-hanging branches by the roadside. He felt like he was swimming in the sky. He said to Felix:</p>
<p>"Don't you think this is fun, huh? Moving your feet like this!"</p>
<p>"You naughty thing!" Older brother Felix replied, looking calm and disdainful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Red Carrot Whiskers became quiet.</p>
<p>He casually stepped over a short stone wall, and the rushing river suddenly appeared before his eyes. Now was not the time for jokes.</p>
<p>The turbulent river surface reflected shimmering light.</p>
<p>The river water rippled like clashing teeth, emitting a desolate sound.</p>
<p>The problem now was that when Lei Pik calculated the appointed time on his watch, he would jump into the water, stay there, and focus all his attention on it. Red Carrot Whiskers felt a chill. Like before, the courage he had mustered to support himself to the end was lost at the crucial moment. The river water, which could entice him from afar, made him uneasy when it appeared before his eyes.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers stood far away, taking off his clothes. On the one hand, he was unwilling to expose his thin body and his feet to others, but the biggest reason was that he was trembling without shame.</p>
<p>He took off his clothes one by one, carefully folded them, and placed them on the grass. He tied his shoelaces tightly, pretending that he couldn't untie them for a long time.</p>
<p>He put on his shorts and took off his shirt because he was sweating. The sweat stuck to the fake leather belt of his paper pants like apple seeds. He lingered for a while.</p>
<p>Older brother Felix had already jumped into the river and was freely splashing the water. He used his arms to row and his heels to kick, creating many bubbles. He even floated in the middle of the river in a frightening way, driving the roaring waves layer by layer towards both banks.</p>
<p>"Don't you want to go down, Red Carrot Whiskers?" Lei Pik asked.</p>
<p>"I'll dry my clothes a bit before going down," Red Carrot Whiskers replied.</p>
<p>Finally, he made up his mind. He sat on the ground and tested the water with a toe that was chafed by his too-small leather shoes. At the same time, he rubbed his stomach, afraid that it hadn't fully digested. Then he slid down the grass roots along the riverbank.</p>
<p>The grass roots tickled his calves, thighs, and buttocks. When the river water reached his stomach, he climbed back up. He felt a wet rope gradually wrapping around him, just like wrapping around a spinning top. But the soil he was leaning on collapsed, and Red Carrot Whiskers fell into the river. The water covered his head. He groped in the muddy water, stood up, coughed, spat, felt bitter and suffocated, and couldn't see anything, as if he had lost his senses.</p>
<p>"You can really dive, my child," Lei Pik said to him. (To be continued)</p>

<p>American Business Association Supports the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Gold Price Rebounds by Ten Yuan and Five Cents</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Speech Is Unfavorable, Briefly Drops Midway</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market rose because of reports that the American Business Association had resolved to maintain the gold standard. Although the exchange rates in the British and American silver markets rose uniformly, the opening price in the gross market rose instead. The initial bid was around 30 yuan, but it was difficult to achieve a deal. Zhi Feng Yong aggressively bought, and the price rose to 30 yuan and 9 cents. Heng Xing then came to sell, and the opening price was 936 yuan and 5 cents. People's hearts were still firm, but banks tended to hoard, and the exchange market was slightly firmer. The price then fell back from 40 yuan to 33 yuan and 5 cents. Many people took advantage of the low price to buy, and the price gradually rose. It was learned in advance that the HSBC bank's listed shilling was reduced by 125, and the US dollar fell by 25. The domestic market once tightened and rose to 43 yuan and 5 cents. Reuters reported that US President Roosevelt had given a speech, saying that it was necessary to resolutely prohibit gold exports and determine the gold-silver ratio at a rate of 5 to 1. The price then fell back again, and the banks continued to hoard. The noon closing price was 940 yuan and 3 cents. In the afternoon, there was no market due to the Spring Racing Carnival, and the spot price was increased by 60 yuan. The situation in the half-day opening was still flat. The US seemed to be yielding on the war debt issue, and people's hearts turned weak. The market situation for the first half of the day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 936 yuan and 5 cents, an increase of 6 yuan and 7 cents compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 6 yuan, and the exchange market opened tightly. The selling price of near-term British exchange was 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 0625. The US exchange rate was 25 yuan and 0625. People's hearts were very stable. Heng Yu and Fu Yu vigorously purchased on the market, and the price surged to 40 yuan. Not many deals were made at this price. For goods, Hua Bi offered August US dollars at 5625, and Fu Chang Shun Li came to sell. Before long, this month's US dollars at 125 were still difficult to sell. Zhong Fu offered July US dollars at 4375, and retreated to 5 yuan. Retail investors raised the price by 1 yuan and a half. Hua Bi continued to offer August US dollars at 6875. Zhao Feng, Chang Da, and De Cheng competed to sell, and the price fell to 33 yuan and 5 cents. Heng Yu then advanced to 6 yuan and a half. However, Shanghai then offered August US dollars at 6875. The domestic market was quite loose. Yu Kang, Bing Xing, and Fu Chang came to sell again for 1 yuan and a half. Heng Xing, Heng Yu, Ri Chang Yuan Kang Xiang purchased one after another, because they had already learned that HSBC's listed British dollar fell by 125 and the US dollar by a small 25. Buyers in the market were excited, and the gold price rose to 9 yuan and 7 cents. Citibank offered June US dollars at 3125, slightly retreating. Although there were many people raising prices, Yong Feng and Yuan Mao Yong held the 40 yuan mark, and Hua Bi also sold July US dollars at 4375, so the market hovered and fell. Before long, Hua Bi also offered August US dollars at 625, and Bing Xing sold them for 7 yuan. After that, the market hovered around 9 yuan, because McGarry offered August dollars at 6875. However, because Hua Bi offered July at 4375, the price retreated to 6 yuan and a half. After hovering for a long time, Fu Chang, Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Tian Feng, Yong, and others suddenly had a strong desire to buy, and the gold price gradually rose. Before long, the banks all wanted August US dollars at 625. Hong Li advanced to 43 yuan. HSBC offered August half yuan, and retreated to 05 cents. Pan Gen ate the same month at 5625. The trend was still firm, but there were no sellers for the latter half yuan. Gan Chang Xiang Rui was excited to buy, and the price rose to 43 yuan and a half. Citibank immediately offered August US dollars at 4375, and July even more so at 3125. Run Chang, Yu Fu, Yu Wan Xing all sold, and the price retreated to within 40 yuan. Heng Xing sold again, to within 8 yuan. Slightly hovered. Finally, Da Xing Yong slightly accepted, and the noon closing price was 940 yuan and 3 cents. Goods were auctioned at 40 yuan. Checking the half-day, the highest price was 943 yuan and a half, and the lowest price was 933 yuan and a half, a difference of ten yuan. As a result, it rebounded by ten yuan and five cents compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The price was announced because HSBC Bank's US exchange rate was reduced by 25, calculated at 25 yuan, 4 yuan and 625, and the alloy price was 974 yuan, 6 jiao and 2 fen. According to the closing price, it was about 34 yuan less. About 7 jiao less than last Saturday. The registered price for this month was 968 yuan, and for June it was 940 yuan. The make-up water price was 968 yuan. There was no transaction for the spot price, and there was a market with no price, because the term price was higher, about 60 yuan to 65 yuan. There was a lack of trading in the market, so the swap was affected. There were still 3,535 notes left for May.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was stable, and buying and selling were active. In summary, Heng Xing, Fu Chang, Yu Kang, Bing Xing, Run Chang, Yu Wan Xing, Shun Li, Cui Tai Zhao Feng, Chang Yong Feng, and others were on the selling side. Zhi Feng Yong Heng Yu Yuan Heng Tian Feng Yong Yuan Mao Ri Chang Yuan Kang Xiang Hong Li Gan Chang Xiang Da Xing Yong and others were on the buying side. Fu Yu Yuan Mao Yong advanced first and then exited. Rui Xing Da De Cheng exited first and then advanced. Guang Bang Heng Xing sold about 200 notes. Da Lian Bang Shun Li Wan Xing sold a little. The total amount of notes in June was 17,605.</p>

<p>The Foreign Market Was Inferior During the Spring Racing Carnival</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar market should have been busy as it was Monday. However, because it was the Western Spring Racing Carnival, the banks on the Bund were only open for half a day in the morning, and they stopped accepting and delivering payments at 12 o'clock ahead of schedule. Therefore, the trends in all aspects were inferior to the past. The morning and noon interbank lending rate in the market was the same at 6 fen, which was 3 fen better than the previous day. The additional water on the overdraft rate rose sharply to 2 jiao. In the check trading, the morning market saw 5.4 million yuan in transfers and new transactions, and the noon market saw more than 500,000 yuan in transactions.

<p>The Small Silver Coins and Copper Coins Both Fell Slightly</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Government Bonds Remained Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, government bonds were still lackluster. Trading still did not improve. The range of ups and downs was small, and the volume of transactions was sparse. After nearly ten days, those who were optimistic thought it was brewing and contained, and there would be a dramatic change. Those who were bearish thought that the economy was sluggish and the purchasing power was weakening. Opinions differed. At this time, it was in between the two. The situation was dull, and everyone was watching each other. Because of watching, the market price hovered. Because of hovering, the volume of transactions decreased. Because the volume of transactions decreased, it was easier to watch again. The cycle continued. The cause was still the shift in the situation. During this brewing period, the phenomenon was already stable. Yesterday morning, the opening was still dominated by selling orders. The market price fell by 5 fen to 3 jiao. In the second session, various front-row stocks continued to fall by 1 jiao and 2 jiao. Since the 20-year issue, it has been slightly better by 1 jiao and 2 jiao. The trend has become a stereotyped essay, hovering within a very small range. In the afternoon, the opening situation seemed to have a lively buying image. No. 11 sold far-term demobilization very actively, and the price fell by half a yuan. The Northern gang sold disarmament, and the price fell by 2 jiao. After entering the market, the momentum had weakened, and it was still a dull hovering path. The 20-volume rose by 1 jiao, and the rest were only 1 jiao and 2 jiao. The closing transactions were particularly clear. Each price, such as 20-volume 20-point fell by 5 fen or 1 jiao. The rest returned to 5 fen to 1 jiao and 2 jiao. As a result, they all returned to a small 1 jiao and 2 jiao. The most, such as the far-term 20-point and salt tax, fell by 1 jiao. The total number of transactions was 3,777,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods, 965,000 yuan in salt tax futures, 700,500 yuan in unified tax, and 615,000 yuan in disarmament. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 300,000 or 400,000. Today is the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the exchange has announced that it will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>New York Stock Prices Fall</p>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported that on Saturday (6th) of last week, the New York stock market fell because the US exchange rate suddenly rose in the last hour, and the bulls flocked to close out their positions, with stock prices falling by as much as 3 yuan. Later, due to an increase in railway freight volume of 42,706 vehicles, the market rebounded slightly before closing. The half-day transactions totaled 2.09 million shares. Currently, inflation is still the main force affecting the stock market. A strong inflationary policy will be the initial work to increase prices and revive commerce. From a long-term perspective, it should build a constructive foundation for stock prices. The Dow Jones Index on the 6th is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Weak Cotton Yarn Standard</p>
<p>丨Today's May 9th Yarn Trading Closed丨</p>
<p>The yarn market is still weak, and the situation is more depressed. Because the actual demand is not strong, all parties are lifeless. In the future, it will be busy with farming, and yarn sales will be even more light. Therefore, people's hearts are trending down. However, some people think that the cotton market is rising, and the desire to go long is strong, so the market can still be maintained. In short, the current yarn consumption is too stagnant, and the upward force is lacking. Tomorrow is May 9th, and yarn and cotton will stop taking plates.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Was Softer. The Near-Term Market Opened With Higher Prices.</p>
<p>The near-term market opened with higher prices due to buying from bulls on the previous day. The taking plates were weaker in the far term. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 1, 4, 6, and 7 jiao. In the afternoon, the prices for each month rose by 3 and 4 jiao due to the firm and rising cotton market, but the far-term market was flat. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,200 bales. It was found that Yi Da sold 950 bales, Chun Ji sold 400 bales, Ji Feng sold 500 bales, and Yi Chang sold 300 bales.

<p>Changsha 165 Fellow Traders 20 Ningbo 3</p>
<p>The Near-Term Flower Has a Squeeze-Out Pattern</p>
<p>The cotton market is still rising, and the situation is firmer. Because there is talk of squeezing out short sellers in the near term, people's hearts are high, and retail investors are making up for their positions. The market is harder. However, certain manufacturers in the far term are selling non-stop, and the pressure is particularly heavy. However, the foreign cotton market is better in recent days. However, the yarn market is very weak, and the cotton market may not rise much.</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard Is Near Hard and Far Soft</p>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened with some selling off, and the market was slightly weak. The near-term market rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao 5 fen. In the afternoon, the market was slightly higher, and the near-term market rose by 1 jiao to 2 jiao, while the far-term market fell by 5 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 68,700 dan.

<p>The Existing Cotton Factories Have No Intention of Advancing</p>
<p>The current demand for cotton is quite calm. The factories have no intention of advancing because the yarn market is not good. Moreover, the price difference between cotton and yarn is too far.</p>

<p>The current goods trading progressed last week. The futures market was active and the prices were high. At the beginning of the week, the adoption of the inflationary law by the United States aroused mass buying. Afterwards, due to bad weather news, speculators and industry insiders engaged in buying. Although some profits were closed out and short selling occurred, they were absorbed by the buyers. Egyptian cotton rose with the foreign cotton market. However, long-staple cotton was difficult to advance due to daily short selling from Sudan.</p>

<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>Continued Records of the Silk Season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>Danyang</p>
<p>In recent years, farmers have paid close attention to the problem of silkworm breeding. The cocoon production is excellent. Unfortunately, the weather is not right, and the silkworm cocoons have suffered repeated poor harvests. Silkworm farmers have suffered great losses. This year, the rice price is surprisingly cheap, and the rural economy is in trouble. In addition, the spring has winter weather, the climate is cold, and the mulberry trees produce leaves later. The silkworm season is later. The farmers who have planted mulberry trees in various cities and towns have now been able to borrow silkworm capital, purchase seeds, and hatch them. The weather is sunny and warm. The early gangs in the areas of Xiacheng, Lucheng, Huangtang, and Jiangshu are just opening their leaves after their second sleep. The late gangs in the areas of Baoshe, Lingkou, Zhaqiao, and Batou are only having enough leaves after their first sleep. The silkworm ants are developing quite well.</p>
<p>Fuyang</p>
<p>The farmers in various cities and towns are panicked by the economy this year and cannot afford to buy seeds. The early gangs are hatching local seeds that they have retained themselves. However, the weather is bad, and 70% to 80% of the silkworms are discarded. Later, seeing that the weather was sunny and warm and the mulberry trees were producing lush leaves, they all borrowed silkworm capital and purchased improved seeds to breed them. The temperature is suitable, and the silkworms are developing favorably. The mulberry leaves are also thriving. The early gangs in the areas of Dayuan Town, Shuxi, and Tangsongbu are having abundant leaves after their third sleep. The late gangs are also starting their sleep. The sleep heads are neat. Unfortunately, the feeding amount is only 40% to 50% of what it was in previous years.</p>
<p>Qimen Black Tea and Wuyuan Green Tea Opened for Weighing and Opening</p>
<p>Qimen black tea has been sunny from the 27th to the 30th. The mountain households hired workers to pick tea. The daily shipments are enthusiastic, and the quality is exceptionally good. This is because there is an intercalary May this year. Although the season has arrived, the climate is still late. The late-planted tea leaves have not sprouted much. In previous years, the mountain households had to keep these tender leaves for a while and would not pick them immediately. This year, they are afraid that the foreign firms will not like the variety, so they choose to buy the best. To avoid lowering the price and discarding them, they pick them all, regardless of the length of the leaves. They also have sunlight to dry the blanks, and the leaves are dry with little water, so the quality of the shipments is rarely seen in recent years. The tea firms initially intended to greatly depreciate the mountain prices for this year. The new offer was only 50 yuan. The mountain households firmly refused to sell at this price, which was less than half of last year's. Later, the firms saw that the new tea was pouring into the market and the quality was not bad. They did not want to insist on the offer price and caused both parties to go their separate ways. They could not help but loosen the offer and open the weighing, offering prices from 60 yuan to 80 yuan depending on the quality of the leaves, which was 20 yuan to 30 yuan lower than before. Although the mountain households' desires were not satisfied, they were willing to lower their minds and seek to sell in this uneven market. If the weather continues to be good these days, the first two batches of tea from each firm can be delivered in full and there is no need to worry about shortages. Wuyuan's eastern road, creek road, Longwei, Dasaka, Jixi, Qingyuan, Duanxin, and Wangkou green teas are developing earlier than the southwest teas. The tea households in each village are meticulous in picking and making tea leaves, so the products are called good. They are often contested by tea firms. This year, the mountain households are generally picking early. Most of them officially opened their gardens on the 20th. The mountain households in the northern road villages were originally scheduled to pick in recent days. However, due to heavy thunderstorms this morning, they temporarily stopped picking and waited for the weather to clear before opening their gardens. The mountain tea on the southwest road is developing more slowly and the buds are still small. They must be left for four or five days before they can be picked. (Day 1)</p>
<p>Grain Thin Rice Is Uniquely Small Corner Xu</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was on the 30th. The street shops are still good and the market is stable, so the situation of Sutong japonica rice and Nangang rice is stable. Only high-quality goods are slightly higher by a few cents. As for the thin rice such as Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sifeng, and Xilian, although the Beiyang gang Qingdao and Weihaiwei customer packages continue to handle nearly 2,000 packages, the purchasing plate is harsh, and the selection is strict. The middle and secondary grades have been clearly separated, and the prices have been revised down by a few cents to a jiao. Duyang pointed rice is still stable. Changbang japonica rice and Bianyuan are stable. Yinyuan lacks goods and is fragrant, and the price has risen by more than a jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's source from He Xia was more than 20 numbers. White japonica rice shops have transactions. The market shape is that high-quality goods are 5 fen more expensive and secondary goods are a jiao more expensive. Thin rice is flat. Early arrival of little and active sales, the price increases nearly 1 foot. Pointed rice is stable. Dubu pointed rice is slightly tight. Customer pointed rice is standing. Yinyuan is slightly tired. Baiyuan is stable.</p>
<p>Foreign Customer Indica Rice Has Both Arrival and Sales Boom</p>
<p>Qingdao Trial Machine Yuan丨 Gang Quwei Gradually Booming</p>
<p>Yesterday, the removal of foreign customer indica rice was very strong. Foreign rice continued to be handled on this street. There were also Min gangs inquiring about small twisted grains. The market price returned to good by 5 fen. It is estimated that 1,300 packages were opened, priced at 7 yuan, 6 jiao to 5 jiao and a half. Saigon No. 1 opened 500 packages, priced at 8 yuan, 2 jiao and a half. Yesterday, 5</p>
<h3>New-Style Prisons</h3>
<p>— Ke Duo</p>
<p>Everyone knows that all the prisons in the Concessions are surrounded by copper walls and iron gates, with strict security, preventing people from being free. As for setting up prisons on the road, it is something people have never heard of. But the Soviet Union now has such prisons. Because the Soviet Union often calls on those rich peasants who are about to be released, or other criminals, to build roads, houses, and cut down forests; if there are technically skilled prisoners, they are made to do public works construction. Because they wear Red Army uniforms (without epaulettes and hat badges), they are easily recognizable and difficult to escape. They work freely without military guards. At the same time, the government also pays them wages, but less than ordinary laborers, and the working hours are longer. The reason for this is that the Soviet authorities regard rich peasants as alien elements, so they want to exploit their labor.</p>
<p>The equipment and treatment in all Soviet prisons are better than in other countries. There is absolutely no severe beatings or harsh treatment for any criminals. They believe that the crimes of criminals are due to the failure of society to educate them, rather than the personal sins of the criminals. Therefore, within the possible range, they carry out educational work for all criminals. If the criminals can truly express remorse for their crimes in their actions and thoughts, they can regain their freedom. The Bolshevo Labor Commune near Moscow accommodates young offenders aged sixteen to twenty-five, allowing them to freely choose a profession without restriction. They are physically free and unrestrained. The government only sends a few policemen to watch them and prevent them from escaping. All public affairs in the commune are handled by various committees organized by the prisoners themselves. The staff in the commune only do auxiliary work: purchasing the raw materials needed by the workplace and selling the products of the commune. If male and female prisoners in the commune fall in love and get married, they can live together after being reviewed by the commune's marriage committee.</p>
<p>In each prison, there are various workshops, reading rooms, dining halls, clubs, bathrooms, and sports fields, but political prisoners are not allowed to read newspapers. Many prisons also have various academic research groups, and the opinions expressed by the designated personnel will not take effect unless they are passed by the members of each group.</p>
<p>Party members with political errors are sent to work among the workers and peasants, so that they can recognize and correct their mistakes in practical life. Those with more serious political errors are first detained by the State Political Directorate, and then exiled to Siberia or Turkestan, etc. As long as the offenders express remorse, the imprisonment can be cancelled and their party membership restored.</p>
<h3>Who Wants to Sell Their Soul?</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>In this society, if you are only a slave to your "belly," or if you are just a person who embraces "belly-ism," then you can live comfortably and happily; otherwise, if you have already fully understood what "life" is and what "death" is, and you must find a meaningful answer, then, unless you have made the final decision - what kind of emotional attitude should we use to explain the matter of K this time?</p>
<p>This happened three weeks after K lost his job. In these three weeks, K lived the vagrant life he had experienced before. Although "poverty" had always felt like a common occurrence to him, because he was poor when he lost his job, and he was equally poor when he had a job, but this time... this was the first time that he had deeply tasted the sorrow of unemployment. So he felt that everything in front of him, and everything that occupied space, was a hideous beast, and these "beasts" needed to be forcefully driven away and conquered! But this state of mind only lasted for a few days, and he was introduced to a national goods factory to do advertising writing work.</p>
<p>"...First of all, you should understand that 'advertising' is used to attract business, this is not a place for you to express your opinions!" A fat-faced, pot-bellied general manager reclined in a rocking chair, pinching the first draft written by K with two fingers, raised his iron-green face and glared at K, issuing a stern voice. If another person encountered this at this time, they would definitely think that this young partner had violated the factory rules and was being reprimanded by the general manager.</p>
<p>"For example, if he is a traitor," after a pause, the general manager pointed at K and said, "you should call him the most enthusiastic and patriotic young man! Because by writing advertisements like this, you can happily attract anyone to our factory to buy goods! Do you know?"</p>
<p>A week later, K's introducer received such a letter: "...I have roughly told you about the XX factory. If I were only thinking about my own belly, of course I would now be sitting happily in their office, in a rocking chair, puffing smoke rings, grabbing a literary thought and writing one or two advertisements for him according to the general manager's consistent principles, and reaching out to get my salary at the end of the month... These are naturally the so-called extremely happy things in life. However, in my heart, I often think: 'Selling labor' - really 'auctioning labor', I already feel extremely aggrieved and extremely indignant, and now they actually want me to auction my entire soul, my entire body - they simply don't treat me like a person, they completely treat me as one of their production machines! You think, who would be willing to give up their soul and be a personal production tool if they have any brains? Even if I feel that my belly is so hungry that it hurts to death, then I can only listen to it, and absolutely have no courage to compromise or bow my head!</p>
<p>"Of course I am extremely grateful to you; but about these things of mine, I ask you to understand me, because I am not just thinking about my 'belly', I am not very afraid of being so hungry that it hurts, and I also know very well that 'hunger' will lead to death, but I need to retain my personality, retain my life!</p>
<p>"I also ask you to forget the former me, because that time's me has already died, and there is absolutely no existence of that thing in the air! I ask you to recognize me!...</p>
<p>K wrote this when his soul had not yet been auctioned off."</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>Why has the expedition been delayed for so long? The excuse is that the throat and food are not enough. A telegram startled the universe, and the storm stirred up and broke the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Ashamed scholar, seven feet tall, no plan to secure the country and defend against the Eastern Qin. I cannot bear to strip naked to welcome the barbarians, and I generously resign and thank the people of the country.</p>
<p>The country's steps are difficult, and the plan is hard to make. I bow and do my best to cross Europe. Before leaving, the six ministers sent each other off, cherish the solitary boat on the Shanghai River.</p>
<p>Not fighting, not making peace, and not defending, empty talk about saving the country, and holding the same. The long-term resistance is a doubtful case, and it is entrusted to the teahouse as a solution. (Remuneration is transferred to aviation to save the country)</p>
<h3>The Story of a Son-in-Law</h3>
<p>— Kuang Bei</p>
<p>The night had just been withdrawn, and the ground was immersed in the thin morning mist, still like a dark gray kraft paper, still like the silence of midnight, gloomy, unable to hear the crowing of chickens common in the countryside, nor the calls of crows and magpies, which is the unique charm of the city's morning, and also the most comfortable time for the city's people. Everyone is tightly wrapping their heads and quilts and snoring, and maybe many people are having a sweet spring night that they have never dreamed of during the day.</p>
<p>It was a bit too mischievous. In the alley, a sudden, sky-splitting whistle sounded like a thunderbolt. So the residents in the front and back buildings, no, simply the residents of the entire alley, were awakened. Everyone went down with sleep-filled eyes with emergency vigilance. In order to find out the truth of the matter, in order to preserve their respective peace, men and women, children dragging the sleeves of adults, gathered into a dark group.</p>
<p>"The incident happened in the pavilion in No. 3. A dozen policemen arrested a very handsome young man," this was the news that Lao Wang rushed to the outside of the alley to find out. And he said with seven or eight points of certainty: "It must be arresting communists, it doesn't matter!"</p>
<p>Uncle Xiong Wu didn't believe it. He said, "I often meet that person. He's so young and so handsome. He's definitely not a poor communist, and he shouldn't be a bandit."</p>
<p>"Even if he's not a communist, not a bandit, he must not be a good person; otherwise, why would he be arrested!" was another's saying.</p>
<p>"Yeah, he shouldn't be a good person!" Everyone roared in unison, which was considered a preliminary conclusion to the case. Time ran like flying, and the sky was completely bright.</p>
<p>The matter had not been revealed, and everyone was still uneasy and refused to leave, although it was already the sound of "crashing" toilet buckets being washed. The second landlord rushed to clear up the facts, saying: "That person's surname is Chen, and his name is Xuehai. Recently, hundreds of letters have been received in the inland. The police said that he is a big liar, so he was arrested."</p>
<p>"Oh, so he's a big liar!" A burst of laughter.</p>
<p>The second landlord continued: "When the police blew the whistle, a dozen of them rushed into his room together. First, they asked if he was Chen Xuehai. Then, they found a big pile of his letters. Then, they took out a newspaper for him to see: There are ladies from noble and scholarly families, with beautiful appearance and gentle nature, who are both proficient in poetry and good at needlework. They could have been matched with high-ranking families to sing and play the zither. However, because there are no heirs in the hall, and because the ladies have never entered school and are not used to love, they are now posting in the newspaper to recruit a son-in-law. Those who ask about their family background, are of good looks and good character (regardless of wealth), and intend to become a son-in-law, please write in detail, attach a photo, and a two-corner stamp, and send it to Chen Xuehai, No. X Lane, XX Road, XX, for forwarding. If it is suitable, a letter will be sent for a face-to-face meeting, and if it is not suitable, it will be returned by registered mail.</p>
<p>So this so-called Chen Xuehai was taken away trembling all over. In fact, there was no scholarly lady who wanted to recruit a son-in-law. He had moved in for less than a month. From his strange and awkward accent, it could be seen that he was a guest from another village. There were no family members, and no relatives and friends came to visit. Usually, he was only seen alone in the room. He actually came up with this trick. Yes, he received a letter with a two-corner stamp. After accumulating four or five hundred letters, there would be hundreds of dollars. No wonder he bundled up the letters early yesterday morning and said that he wanted to return the house and wouldn't live there anymore. In fact, he was recruiting a ghost son-in-law. He was a big liar!"</p>
<p>"How could so many people be fooled by him?" Everyone surrounded the second landlord and asked. The second landlord gave another explanation, which was fully reasonable and experienced.</p>
<p>"It is true that some people believe in this kind of fraud in the city. Just look at the usual playboys and prodigals, who can't even cry for a woman. Now that there is such an opportunity - recruiting a son-in-law, and the conditions are very good, who would be stingy with a two-corner stamp? If the days are accurate and you meet the right person, wouldn't it be comfortable! Even if it doesn't work out, sacrificing a two-corner stamp doesn't matter anyway."</p>
<p>"Anyway, people who use this kind of fraud should be killed ten thousand times!" a delicate girl interrupted.</p>
<p>"I've lived for sixty years, and I've never seen such a clever thing. This world is really going to be turned upside down!" was the sigh of an elder with a cane.</p>
<p>The matter was considered to be fairly clear, and the crowd of spectators scattered sparsely in the warm sunshine all over the ground.</p>
<h3>After the Divorce</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The time was about ten years ago, right? He and she got married. On the day she returned to her parents' home, the two of them walked hand in hand in our countryside. Ten years ago, in Shanghai, it was not a strange thing for men and women to walk hand in hand. They had already copied the art of walking hand in hand from Westerners very skillfully. However, in our semi-civilized countryside, it was probably the first time that men and women walked hand in hand, right? When they walked through the market, how could the general public not call it a strange thing? The old scholar in Sanjia Village, seeing the two of them walking side by side, was so angry that his beard stood on end and he was saying something like "The world is going downhill!" "The country will perish soon!"</p>
<p>From this point, we can prove that their relationship was extraordinarily harmonious when they got married. However, in less than three or four years, their relationship suddenly changed from dense to plain, and from plain to broken. According to the general public, her husband actually had a secret relationship with her girl, between siblings. A woman's jealousy is innate. If her husband has another lover, how can she suppress the burning of her jealousy? After three or four years of fermentation, the result was finally divorce. When she divorced and then, on that day, with disheveled hair and tears in her eyes, and alone returned home, we witnessed her embarrassing situation, her miserable color, and her former liveliness turned into a stupid chicken. Suddenly, in our minds, we repeated the scene of the two of them walking side by side in the small market after their honeymoon ten years ago, and sighed at those verses like "All things are like a revolving candle" and "Husbands are frivolous children!"</p>
<p>Although her youth has stepped on the edge, she is still unable to suppress the burning of the fire of youth. After the divorce, she lived a widowed life in her parents' home for two or three years, and finally had a mysterious relationship with a man. But as a result, her stubborn father discovered her secret and immediately roared and scolded her severely. That time, she shed bitter tears all day and night, but who could she complain to? Finally, her father placed her under house arrest, not allowing her to associate with her lover anymore, and in the deep hours of the night, old hatreds and new sorrows gathered on her scarred soul, and all kinds of pain were difficult to describe in words.</p>
<p>It was this year's New Year's Day, right? Her ex-husband, it was said, got married in her port. On that day, the scene was extravagant, the dignitaries and well-wishers were lively, and it set a new record for her port. When she learned of this news, she cried for a whole week. Finally, she ran away from home. She really couldn't keep her empty room. She had to leave and resolutely went to live with her lover. However, until now, although she is living with her lover, she has not officially married. If she gets married, she is afraid that her father will not recognize her and society will curse her. Alas! Under this kind of evil force, she can only secretly marry, but cannot remarry publicly. After a man divorces, he can remarry in a dignified manner, but a woman cannot remarry. Alas! This is nothing more than one-sided chastity, and we should break the old etiquette-based prejudices of her father and the general public in society, such as "A good woman does not marry two husbands, and a loyal minister does not serve two masters," and shout the slogan "Abolish the cannibalistic old etiquette," and quickly fight for a way out for them after divorce!</p>
<h3>Miss Zhu, Who Doesn't Forget Old Friends</h3>
<p>— Jing Yu</p>
<p>Miss Zhu was a social butterfly in Town A five years ago. Relying on her beautiful appearance and agile skills, she tempted the general youth, and no one was not lost! And the young master X, who was known as the richest man in the village, went bankrupt because of this!</p>
<p>After young master X went bankrupt, she also ended up in dire straits and wandering, making it difficult to live. And the social ridicule also came one after another. She suffered this kind of stimulation and felt that sticking to one place was not a long-term strategy; so she had to abandon her lover and seek another way out. From then on, her beautiful shadow disappeared from Town A.</p>
<p>Five years have passed, and everyone has forgotten. This year's Qingming Festival, a fashionable young woman in gorgeous clothes suddenly came to Town A, followed by a young maid, who was also dressed neatly. The people in the town were surprised at first sight; then, after careful examination, they recognized that she was Miss Zhu, the lover of young master X, who had been away for five years. Because of the cinnabar red mole on her chin, which was naturally shaped like a broad bean, those who had seen her true face would not have difficulty imagining it.</p>
<p>It is said that she has now made a fortune and is married to a wealthy merchant at sea; she lives in a large house and travels in a car, and her luxury is beyond that of the nobility. This time, she came back to her hometown, ostensibly to sweep the tomb, but in fact, she meant to return home in glory and boast to her neighbors.</p>
<p>Young master X, who had fallen into the lower class, was overjoyed to hear this news; on Qingming Day, he ran to his parents' grave and waited patiently; after she finished burning paper money and kowtowing, he put on a hippie smile and used the familiar title to say:</p>
<p>"Ah Zhu! You..."</p>
<p>"Thief beggar! How dare you call the Madam's name?" The maid looked at it too indecently and angrily scolded him.</p>
<p>"Haha! Don't scold, your Madam used to be with me..."</p>
<p>"Stop! If you want to beg for money, say it nicely, what are you talking about?" She was afraid that she would say something unpleasant, so she immediately stopped him.</p>
<p>"Then please do a good deed and give me some money." He changed his tone and said smoothly.</p>
<p>"Okay! I'll give you a few coins." As she said this, she took out a stack of banknotes from her purse and took out a five-yuan note and gave it to him.</p>
<p>"Ah Zhu! No! Miss Zhu, please give me another one." He took the money ticket in one hand, and stretched out the other hand.</p>
<p>At this time, she remembered the past and couldn't bear to refuse; so she gave him another one very readily.</p>
<p>He got this unexpected wealth, stuck out his tongue at her, made a grimace, shrugged his shoulders, and ran to the opium den to have a good time!</p>
<p>The next night, she bid farewell to her hometown and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Tricks of Love</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>It is said that the skinny monkey Xiao Li is still a top student in the Affiliated High School of University X. He has a long face, a tall and thin body, and can also play a few football tricks. As long as the male students of University X mention the word "skinny monkey," everyone knows that it is "Xiao Li."</p>
<p>However, there is an exception, which may be a lifelong regret for the skinny monkey Xiao Li: that is, the palace of the Eastern Palace is heavily guarded, so that Xiao Li cannot make the general female students recognize his great name, so as to solve the lifelong affairs from it.</p>
<p>The cats chasing each other came to shout all night; the little birds, not afraid of the jealousy of the lonely, very lively and nestled together singing in pairs. The amorous seeds of Xiao Li, after experiencing this lovely and annoying spring scenery, felt nothing but "uncomfortable" in his heart!</p>
<p>"Uncomfortable" "Uncomfortable", really "uncomfortable" beyond comparison! So he plucked up the courage to do a poetic beauty that caused a stir throughout the school and was passed on as a good story.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Empress X of the Eastern Palace suddenly received a letter of love to her. It said roughly: The beauty of the Empress surpasses that of butterflies, and her "abundant" and "soft" body is enough to make him admire her so much that he forgets to sleep and eat! Fortunately, Heaven has granted a strange缘, studying in the same school, how should we seize the "hard to buy with gold" youth, and not let it pass in vain. At the end, he also showed the spirit of self-introduction, saying that his character and learning were sufficient to qualify him as a friend of the Empress. If you don't believe it, please come to the third row of seats in Classroom X at X o'clock on Sunday morning. I would be grateful if the Empress would move and teach.</p>
<p>After some thought, the Empress did move 王观光 the next day and saw a youth in a western suit reading English with十足 spirit, who just stood up in the third row of seats to greet her; however, she just seemed to have realized "So that's who you are" and immediately returned.</p>
<p>On Monday, on a notice board facing the front of the auditorium, unexpectedly, all the students who had just come out of the memorial week were made to look up and compete to see a rose-colored letter paper pasted on it, a letter written in regular script with blue ink, which was the love letter received by Empress X. After everyone speculated based on the pseudonym and handwriting, it turned out that the beauty done was by our skinny monkey Xiao Li! Then, that day happened to be a math quiz, and on the skinny monkey Xiao Li's blank paper, as if he had a nervous breakdown, he wrote a few sentences:</p>
<p>"The teacher's question is spicy, the student cannot answer; happy" give a few points; if you don't give it, then so be it!"</p>

<h3>The Life of a Woman (Continued 4)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>However, these things were seen every day, and the Japanese Consulate was indifferent to them.</p>
<p>Today, she still went to the girls' school as usual. Before class started, everyone was playing with rubber balls, and naturally, she joined in. Carelessly, someone else's ball was blocked by her, and that girl began to scold her loudly!</p>
<p>"Bitch! Cheap slut!..."</p>
<p>"Who are you calling that?" She couldn't help but retort.</p>
<p>"I'm calling you that. You're a little bitch, everyone knows it!"</p>
<p>But she felt there was no need to argue back. Who would be afraid of such a small kid? She stepped forward and slapped the girl across the face. The girl cried out, wiping away her tears with one hand while stamping her feet and running to tell the principal, with many girls following behind. But she didn't think much of it. Let her go tell, who was afraid? Who knew, after a while, the principal actually came, a middle-aged woman with wire-rimmed glasses and a pair of bound and then unbound feet that were swollen very high, walking very loudly on the bluestone pavement. Finally, she arrived in front of her, pinching her ear with two fingers and dragging her into the room. She seemed extremely angry, her eyes revealing a fierce light. She pointed at the girl's willow-leaf-like forehead and said:</p>
<p>"Speak! Whose daughter are you? What does your family do?"</p>
<p>"............"</p>
<p>"Speak up! Why don't you say it?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," was her reply.</p>
<p>"Fine, you don't have to say it, we already know. Now I'm telling you, get out of here immediately! Our girls' school doesn't accept bitches... A bitch even wants to study, don't corrupt the other children."</p>
<p>She walked home from school, feeling very sad along the way, and then she cried.</p>
<p>Bitch, now a little bitch, and when she grows up, even more of a bitch... Since she's a bitch, she's not allowed to study. This is probably an immutable principle.</p>
<p>Employee Correspondence</p>
<p>More Than Half Are From</p>
<p>Schools Where There Are No Classes</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>This year, through a friend's introduction, I enrolled in a private middle school in the French Concession. The school's curriculum looks impressive, adhering to the Ministry of Education's standards in every way. But what is the reality? More than half of the class hours are never taught. My precious time for studying is being wasted like this. One day, I couldn't bear it any longer and had a major negotiation with the principal, but strangely, he didn't act like a principal at all, only sighing that there was no way to fix it. In the end, there was no satisfactory answer. Sir, this kind of school is really misleading young people. Driven by a sense of injustice, I want to have a major negotiation with him, but how should I proceed? Please advise me. With best regards, Zhao Peng.</p>
<p>X X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Solving Mr. Zhao's personal problem is very easy. You might as well transfer to another school with substantial content and serious management. Fortunately, the more these kind of "wild chicken" schools are, the less they are willing to reduce fees. They would rather lower their heads and endure the students' anger, but they absolutely cannot relax when it comes to money. So, if you transfer to another school, you shouldn't have financial difficulties, and everything else will be easier.</p>
<p>However, since Mr. Zhao has experienced this firsthand, he should find a way to prevent others from being fooled in the future. You should present the details of this school's situation to the Municipal Education Bureau in detail. If necessary, you should also contact classmates to come forward as witnesses, and you must ensure that you achieve the goal of forcing them to close down.</p>
<p>On the Municipal Education Bureau's side, when they receive such a report, they must conduct a thorough investigation and handle it seriously. Even if it is in the concession, they must find a way to exercise their authority. Recovering the educational rights of the concession is easier to start with than recovering the concession itself. If they don't take concrete action on this point, then what face do they have to be the bureau director?</p>

<h3>Movies in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Fu Jingjia</p>
<p>West Lake is the Supply Base for On-Location Shooting of Domestic Films</p>
<p>The film industry in Shanghai is extremely developed, but what about other places? I think some people would be very happy to hear about it, right? Now, I will report to the readers on the film industry in Hangzhou:</p>
<p>In my opinion, movies in Hangzhou are quite pitiful. In such a large commercial port, there are only three pure movie theaters. No, one of them sometimes also puts on Peking opera or new plays.</p>
<p>Among the three theaters, the West Lake Auditorium Cinema is considered the best. It is located in West Lake, very quiet, and the scenery is very good. The theater is the former auditorium of the West Lake Exposition. The films shown are all foreign films, and very old ones at that. Occasionally, domestic films are shown, mostly from Lianhua. However, when domestic films are shown, the prices are more expensive. This theater originally belonged to the Hangzhou Electric Plant, and was later converted into a commercial operation. It is well decorated, and the architecture is in line with artistic trends. However, it is far from the city, which is not very convenient, especially at night. The audience is mostly students, and there are not many workers. If one were to talk about movie theaters in Hangzhou, this one could be called aristocratic.</p>
<p>Next is the Hangzhou Cinema at the train station. It is worse than the West Lake Cinema, but the seat prices are not low. The films shown are mostly from Star, and occasionally some foreign sound films, such as "Dragon and Tiger Fight." It shows two times a day. In hot weather, the prices are sometimes reduced, and two full-length films are shown consecutively. The audience is mostly from the upper-middle class.</p>
<p>The most pitiful is the Zhejiang Grand Theater. The facilities are poor, and the interior is very unsanitary. Many viewers are unwilling to go inside. It shows some old, funny foreign films. This theater often changes its name and tricks. It cannot be called a pure movie theater, but in Hangzhou, where movies are not developed, it can only be allowed to occupy a place.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a movie theater in the Great World, but it mostly shows good films such as "XX Great Swordsman" and "Burning XX," and sometimes also shows films like "The Lady Who Kills."</p>
<p>In short, the film industry in Hangzhou is not developed. However, Hangzhou has an excellent West Lake, so many people go to Hangzhou to shoot on-location. We can say that Hangzhou is the supply base for on-location film shoots.</p>
<h3>Introducing the Slapstick Film "Desperate"</h3>
<p>— Ailian</p>
<p>Since the Happy Film Company's "Chicken and Duck Couple" was released, although the film itself cannot be said to be a success, it did break the pioneering record of domestic slapstick films. So, Liu Chunshan has shot another film called "Desperate" in these three months. Realizing that he is unfamiliar with the film industry, he has asked many people to help him this time. It is said that the film has been approved by the Central Government and will be released soon.</p>
<p>It depicts an enemy country buying off spies to disrupt a Chinese territory. The Chinese army repeatedly "desperately" uses tricks to trap the enemy, killing them so that not a single one returns. Countless funny scenes are created in the midst of this "desperate" effort. Of course, everything in the pavilion is metaphorical, containing a very deep patriotic meaning. It is said that there is a large section of Erhuang opera in it, and each section uses newly composed lyrics to satirize the people who signed the "traitorous treaty." None of the corrupt and flattering officials of the former Qing Dynasty are spared. The慷慨悲哥 (kāng kǎi bēi gē - singing with generous emotion) is exceptionally moving.</p>
<p>When filming the battlefield scene in this film, because they were trying to be too realistic, they filled the bullets with cotton. Unexpectedly, three people were injured, which shows their efforts when filming.</p>
<p>As for the comedic aspects, there are many interludes, and Liu Chunshan's performance is the most satisfactory. The results of the screening are also much better than "Chicken and Duck Couple." More on this after the public release!</p>
<h3>Xuan Jinglin Stars in "Future"</h3>
<p>— Yin Chun</p>
<p>Since the release of "Raging Current," the productions of Star Film Company have made significant progress in terms of script awareness and performance techniques. For example, "Women's Cry," which was recently released, put forward the slogan of women's liberation. "Moral Mirror" exposed the mask of pseudo-moralists; "Powder Market," which will be released soon, reveals the sequel to the issue of women's employment in real society; and "Future," which was recently completed, raises the question of whether a woman is settled once she gets married.</p>
<p>The traditional Chinese concept has always been that a woman is settled once she marries a husband, and "her life is set." It seems that the only responsibility of a woman is to be a "virtuous wife and loving mother." The women's movement in China has never been successful. This can also be said to be one of the root causes. "Future" has grasped this issue, which is not much noticed but is very important.</p>
<p>It is said that the director, Zhang Shichuan, put a lot of effort into the techniques, so the results are good. The lead role is played by Ms. Xuan Jinglin, who has rejoined Star, and the new Star actor Sun Min. Their expressions are reliable. In "Future," we should not be disappointed, right?</p>
<h3>A Bunch of Local Film News</h3>
<p>— Ailian</p>
<p>Hollywood slapstick duo Wheeler and Woolsey arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru on May 6 and checked into the Cathay Hotel. They will go to Europe around the 15th. Not many people visited them, and there were no Chinese reporters, it is said.</p>
<p>After Bai Jinlong was banned, Xue Juexian was very disappointed. The Bai Jinlong film is planned to be released in Hong Kong, because the Central Government has no right to interfere with the Hong Kong screening rights. It is also heard that RKO Pictures of the United States has sent a manager stationed in South China to contact Mr. Xue and invite him to make films in the United States. Because Xue has no interest in performing without stage plays, this may become a reality.</p>
<p>The filming of "Spring Tide" has been nearly a year, and recently it was almost banned by the Central Government. However, after slightly deleting and revising it, it has been decided that it will be released publicly in Shanghai before the end of May. The location is planned to be at the New Light or Carlton, it is said.</p>
<p>It is heard that Carlton will try its best to be the concentration of domestic films, starting with the screening of films at the Da Guangming. The first film will be the Star Film Company's "Powder Market." The Lianhe Company's self-produced "Return My Rivers and Mountains" will also be released at Carlton in a short time, it is said.</p>
<p>The film bureau that the Ministry of Education is actively preparing will soon become a reality. However, the bureau's expenses will rely on the film industry. It is said that thereafter, the inspection fee and license fee for both Chinese and foreign films will be quadrupled, it is said.</p>
<p>There are probably three films of the North China War that will be released recently. MGM, Fox, and Paramount (Johnson-Reorganized) have all sent specialists. These kinds of on-the-spot films will be as sensational as the Shanghai War films, it is said.</p>
<p>Starting next week, the lecture hall of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA will show popular education films every week, charging a small fee of two dimes to show restriction. Children or members will all get half price. The Lianhua Company's blockbuster "New Year's Eve," which will be released at the Beijing Grand Theater, is said to have a script written by Luo Mingyou. It is the first time in China that the general manager also兼編劇 (jiān biān jù - also writes the screenplay).</p>
<p>After the completion of "Opportunity" by Tianyi Film Company, they originally planned to start filming "Dawn." Unexpectedly, the main actor, Li Minghui, thought that the script was inappropriate, so Chen Yumei's "Twilight" was advanced.</p>
<h3>Half a Day in Spring for "Modern Woman"</h3>
<p>— Wen Lu</p>
<p>The notice clearly stated: Departure at 1:00 PM to Bansong Garden to film the on-location spring outing of "Modern Woman," with several circles drawn next to it.</p>
<p>Having not been to the countryside for a long time, and having been living in the metropolis, I felt an indescribable sense of leisure and joy. Everything that met my eyes revealed a living smile.</p>
<p>Halfway through the car ride, the stage manager, Gao Bu Lao Xiao, used his 京油子 (jīng yóu zi - slick talker from Beijing) mouth again and said, "Sigh! I've been in Shanghai for so long, and I haven't even been to Bansong Garden."</p>
<p>Our little-mustached director, Mr. Li Pingqian, said in his usual humorous tone: "Those who haven't been to Bansong Garden have to kowtow before entering, otherwise they'll have diarrhea when they go back."</p>
<p>"Hey, you're making fun of us again."</p>
<p>Gao Bu Lao Xiao撇 (piě - curled) his lips, expressing disbelief. After a while, he pretended to be stupid and asked, "Do you really have to kowtow? Even "Modern Woman" hasn't been there."</p>
<p>As soon as I heard him bring it up to me, I said, "I've been there hundreds of lifetimes ago."</p>
<p>"Sigh, to be honest, it's really happy to come out and play for work in such a good spring, really happy." As he said this, his mouth kept moving, as if he was tasting the taste of spring. Li Pingqian was singing the lyrics that he had written himself. Listening to his words and seeing his mouth moving so funny, he jokingly said: "Spring is here, the cats are calling, the fish are jumping."</p>
<p>"Gao Bu Xiao's face is broken." I saw that Mr. Gao Bu Xiao's face had a big cut because of shaving, and a bright red mark was printed on his blue chin, and then I said this sentence. After speaking, I couldn't help but cry. Li Pingqian also cried. He knew that this sentence of mine was following the previous sentence. He pointed at me and said with a chuckle, "You...you...you see, this little 京油子 (jīng yóu zi - slick talker from Beijing), is really bad."</p>
<p>"Little 京油子 (jīng yóu zi - slick talker from Beijing)? The 京油子 (jīng yóu zi - slick talker from Beijing) is the most unable to speak, the 京油子 (jīng yóu zi - slick talker from Beijing) can't beat the 衛嘴子 (wèi zuǐ zi - people from Tianjin), the 衛嘴子 (wèi zuǐ zi - people from Tianjin) can't beat the bean curd skin, that is, the people from Beijing can't beat the people from Tianjin, and the people from Tianjin can't beat the southerners." (I mean to say that I am from Beijing and the most unable to speak.)</p>
<p>The car arrived. Buy tickets at the door. We soon found the colleagues who came to shoot "Spring Water Love Wave" in the morning.</p>
<p>The garden was full of peach blossoms, charming and beautiful. Sun Min and I were sitting on the boat, surrounded by peach blossoms. Filming on the boat is the most annoying thing, the boat is always moving without listening to commands, and the camera is naturally not easy to focus. As a result, a rope was tied to the stern of the boat, and people on the shore pulled it.</p>
<p>The director with the small mustache said to try it once. He told us to eat oranges happily, the shot was very short, so we naturally did it casually. I was eating the orange, and I took two more petals from his hand and put them to my lips. As soon as he opened his mouth, I shrank back.</p>
<p>Ha, ha, I tricked him, I laughed, but he pretended to be angry and said: "Hua Dan, you can't do this."</p>
<p>We were闹着 (nào zhe - joking), when suddenly we heard a sound "READY!" We were very serious with the shout of this romantic director (the title given to him by Mr. Zhang Shao).</p>
<p>GO CUT! We regained our freedom.</p>
<p>Five shots took four hours.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, in order to turn around and hug Sun Min... This is in the play. One foot kissed the water very intimately, and the wet foot was just like the kissed lips, but it was a little bit cold and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>On the way back, the car flew west from the east end of Lafayette Road. On the way, I saw many people setting up stalls to sell old goods, as well as all kinds of laborers. Li Pingqian said with emotion:</p>
<p>"A long Lafayette Road, but lives in very opposite characters, absolute environment, absolute enjoyment: the east section lives the laborers, the businessmen, the middle is the petty bourgeoisie, and the west end are all the old masters and ladies who have big houses and come in and out of cars.</p>
<h3>New Inventions in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Li Keda</p>
<p>Restoration of Discarded Film</p>
<p>The film used in film production has always been almost regarded as waste because the actor's acting skills are not suitable, or the photographer is not careful and leaks light. Its price is only two or three cents per pound, and a pound of FILM is about 600 feet long. According to the market price of the previous month, each foot costs about 28.5 cents. In various film companies, such losses are very high.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Ando Haruzo of the Osaka Industrial Experiment Station in Japan has invented a method of remanufacturing photosensitive film (i.e. used film). After more than a year of research, it was finally completed. This method is to soak the sensitized FILM in a special tincture and bromine potash for about one or two minutes. The sensitized part of the film is影 (yǐng - affected) by the aqueous gas of tincture and bromine, so that the unsensitized silver bromide is还原 (huán yuán - reduced). After a series of sensitization procedures, the new film is completed.</p>
<p>The production cost of such film averages about eight or nine cents per foot (its processing cost is five cents). It is only one-twentieth of the price of new FILM. Isn't this great news for the film industry? I hope that our country's scientists will also work hard to research so as to make contributions to the motherland.

<h3>Film Novel Secrets (SECRETS) (3)</h3>
<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>William Myro immediately ran home in a huff and called his wife, daughter, and Susan over. He痛斥 (tòng chì - severely criticized) his daughter and his wife's younger sister, but he couldn't make the two of them sincerely convinced, so he began to exercise his patriarchal authority. He ordered Mary to marry Lord Harley quickly; they would return to England within two days; Mary was not allowed to go out before getting married; she was not allowed to communicate with John Carton; if private correspondence was discovered, that bastard would be publicly whipped immediately and then expelled from the country. This was the哀的美敦書 (āi de měi dūn shū - ultimatum) that William Mymy issued to his daughter.</p>
<p>At the dance party at night, William Myro publicly announced the news that Mary and Lord Harley were about to get married, and said that Harley would return to England with his bride on his boat the day after tomorrow. While everyone was羨幕 (xiàn mù - admiring) and celebrating, Mary had seen the shadow of John Carton in the darkness outside the window. He instructed her aunt to talk to him and tell him not to go, that she wanted to see him.</p>
<p>After a while, John climbed to the window of Mary's bedroom with a long ladder, and Mary took him in. John told her that he would leave for the West tomorrow. He said that her father had dismissed him and would not give him a certificate, so he could not find a job in New England, and he had to go to California to try his luck. He said that he would definitely develop in the future, and then come back to see her. Please rest assured. He said goodbye to her like this. But Mary死不放他走 (sǐ bù fàng tā zǒu - absolutely refused to let him go). She wanted to go with him, she begged him to take her with him. John told her that this trip to the West would be difficult and arduous. He might suffer from cold and hunger. She was a 　閣小姐 (gé xiǎo jiě - daughter of a rich family), spoiled since childhood, and was afraid that she would not be able to bear hardship. But Mary insisted on going. She said that as long as she had John as a companion, she would be indifferent to life and death, and what was there to be afraid of?</p>
<p>They hurriedly changed their clothes. Outside the door, her father urged her why she didn't come out, she hurriedly hid John, and told her father that she was not feeling well, and she was going to bed after服衣 (fú yī - taking medicine). Her father said, "You can take off your clothes, but can't you put them on?" Mary then promised her father that she would definitely come out within ten minutes. Her father left, and Mary and John slipped out of the window and ran away.</p>
<p>William Myro and Lord Harley were chatting on the corridor of the living room. Harley said: "I am satisfied that your daughter married me, and I couldn't be happier. But I always doubt whether she is willing to marry me." William patted him on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry. Mary is the most loyal woman, and she can be your most obedient wife. Girls are always a little shy." At this time, John and Mary were riding tall bicycles and passing by the door, but they were talking and didn't see them.</p>
