<h3>從殖民經濟到統制經濟</h3>
<p>— 有</p>
<p>統制經濟。現已成爲舉國屬目的問題。我們以爲在發展國民經濟的目標之下所當深节認識的。不在於應否謀經濟的統制。而是一個能否统統制經濟的問題。如果没有認識到這一層。結果恐怕會畫虎。類犬。無益而害。</p>
<p>統制經濟的實現。須有下述幾種前提。</p>
<p>第一要有實力雄厚的金融中樞。在一般資本主義極度發達的國家裏面像英國有英蘭銀行。像美國有聯邦準備銀行。像東鄰的日本。有日本銀行。這些中央銀行。都是在總攬外匯。統一發行。節制信用等等方面。可以發揮至高無上的權力。以我國而論。中央銀行而外。輔以極大的本國商業銀行。尙未足以减削外商銀行之勢力。外商銀行的勢力。在於吸收巨量存欵。總攬外　匯兌。他不但發行自已的鈔票。還可拒絶受收我國銀行的紙幣在這種情形之下。倘要嚴格施行統制經濟的方法。那就不免要爲叢驅爵了。並且這些［外。國銀行勢力。］在我國金融市場的地位。和他們在印度南洋香港一帶比較。覺得毫無二致。是早已把我國漸漸淪於殖民地的等級。這樣。統制怎能行得通。</p>
<p>第二。要有節制外國資本和商品的方法在目前許多歐美國家裏面。外國資本的活動大都受政府管理。被限於極小的範圍以内。外國商品的輸出入。更是絶對受國家的嚴密監督。這都是他們爲要挽救本國工商業的危機。所以才有這樣嚴厲的統制。我國呢。商品入超年達九萬元之巨。外國在華資本。已逾百萬萬元。而每年繼續新增的投資。不下二萬萬左右。如果統制經濟要謀根本的辦法。首先必須限制外國資本和商品在我國市場的活躍才行。</p>
<p>統制經濟的主要意義。須能培植本國資本的積累。引導工商利潤的向上。萬不是高唱空論。亦不是枝節從事所能成功的。以我國目前農工商業國民經濟而論。誠有謀統制以挽危機之必要。但如不注意它的前提。則怎樣可以實現統制的經濟呢。因此問題的中心。應該是首先講求怎樣脫離目前的殖民經濟。</p>

<h3>德與國聯絶緣黷武國引爲同調益堅擴軍信念　英相握挽回歐局鎖鑰　軍縮問題難關　將另覓取新途徑解决　總委會定今日開會</h3>
<p>（東京）此次以德國退出國聯爲契機而與同樣立塲之日本互相提携又於日本之建艦運動是否與以刺激頗堪危欋在歐洲尤以倫敦方面甚爲憂慮日外務省對於此事處以極其冷靜之態度茲錄其見解於左（一）此次德國退出國聯乃爲戰敗國脫離凡爾塞條約之拘束而向其國家平權之確立以求出路此爲當然之第動可以推想而知之日本則無任何意外之感觸（二）日本僅圖其能徹底行使對外政策彼歐洲之變化當無加入清算之必要歐爲歐亞爲亞由此種個别觀念而决定獨自之政策國論已完全一致矣（三）鑑於斯項國論而歐人反以爲日本將與德國提携或有所企圖頗抱危懼之觀念此爲歐洲各國依然缺乏對於極東之認識可爲鐵證亦係德國所以退出國聯之理由也（四）日本將發生建艦運動此種議論亦可謂爲德日提携之先聲但日本之建艦已於倫敦條約所允許之質量以内得以充實内容故此項情形實不過單獨之杞憂而已云云（十五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日軍閥對德同情</h3>
<p>（東京）關於德國脫離國聯、日海軍當局視爲異常嚴重據其所述意見如左德國退出國聯及軍縮會議實爲非常重大之問題尤以軍縮會議將來更難收拾如英首相麥唐納且謂此次軍縮會議倘未能收拾則歐洲將陷於混亂可見此事非僅爲歐洲之重大問題實爲世界之大問題也云（十五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）德國退出國聯與軍縮會議之事發生以後日本陸軍當局之推測如左在歐戰大興奮時期之後又遭巴黎和平條約之拘束於日國民思想强化之德國在軍縮會議席上則要求與英法意三國軍備平等此爲可表同情之件乃此次　國竟實行退出軍縮會議可見彼等目無德國並不能縮少軍備自然陷於破裂其理甚明但關於此案希特勒之决意如何今後希氏之態度最爲興致濃厚之問題而自此以往各國之國家主義愈趨强化而列强彼此非僅軍備即經濟上亦當成爲對立之狀態也云（十五日日聯電）</p>

<h3>希特勒播音演說痛斥戰勝國家　列國以壓迫爲能事　和平擊於誠摯合作</h3>
<p>（柏林）德總理希特勒今夜在此作播音演說由德國各　電臺播送全國謂法德兩國果能從其共同生活中排除强暴則將爲全體人類之極大事業云</p>
<h3>遵守和約納劍於鞘</h3>
<p>希氏追述一九一八年休戰以來之事件謂當時德國信任威爾遜總統十四條大綱故納劍於鞘如世界在休戰後之年月中以公允方式伸其手與殘破之國家提携則人類定可省去無數苦辛德國曾竭其力以療治其敵國之瘡痍當德國遵守和約銷毀武器以期便利世界軍縮時各國人民皆以爲此乃常識勝利之起點</p>
<h3>戰勝國家氣𦦨逼人</h3>
<p>德國有權希望世界他處履行其諾言但不辛他國政治領袖皆具有戰勝國氣燄之人物殊不知世界之恢復繫於各國誠意之合作與戰爭心理之消滅而非被蹂躪國之奴隸工作所能保慞者也各交戰國皆自信未犯甘爲戎首之罪夫旣有此信心則尤不應發生永久之讐意而故意保留慘禍之紀念</p>
<h3>對法不作戰爭幻想</h3>
<p>德國人民雖要求和約所許之權利但除法德間所有之爭點外德國並無土地上之爭執當薩爾區域交還德國之時凡事理明白者决不作法德可起戰爭之幻想德國青年不作反對法國之示威行動僅注重於爲遏制共産主義所必要之政治運動耳如世界各國各自爲謀築不可毀滅之砲壨造龐大之飛機重砲與坦克車則不能指徒手排隊而行之國社黨爲世界之大害也</p>
<h3>不甘屈居低等地位</h3>
<p>他國皆有自衛權而德國獨無之此直視德國人民爲低等階級之行爲耳目前德國執政之人物與一九一八年十一月之受賄叛國者絶不相類吾人不負戰爭之責亦不負戰爭中所發生事件之責但負凡有榮譽心者必須爲其受難人民有所作爲之責耳云云（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>對德誣蔑變本加厲</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒於演說中稱各國對於德國加以種種誣罔之詞如倫敦方面對於［德國衆議院縱火案竟有舉行調查之滑稽劇］此非德國所能忍受者又謂［在現任内閣總理領導下之法國政府謂無威脅或侮辱德國民族之意吾人聞之深爲感動且有後望吾人對於此言敬聞命矣］</p>
<h3>軍備均等他無所求</h3>
<p>旋又謂德國并不要求重整軍備所求者惟權利平等而已因此國際上如承認若干國得設置某種軍械則本乎平等之義德國亦可設置之此若吝而不予則視德國爲二等國家實非德國所能接受德國加呚國聯會與軍縮會議原望德國民族有與其他民族享受平等權利之一日此而不能辦到是直以不堪忍受之侮辱加諸德國希氏作此言時聲浪極高繼謂裁减軍備各國均有諾言德國方面履行義務已達極點此時其他軍備强大之國自應踐其諾言］希氏又云德國皮種要求對於其他國家并非有何威脅德國所要求者不在設置攻擊軍器而在設置一切國家均可保有而不爲來軍縮所禁止之防禦軍器</p>
<h3>誠摯合作和平期</h3>
<p>希氏結論謂［吾人係一誠實民族之代表本身又爲愛惜名譽之人以故某種建設僅爲不顧名譽之人所能忍受者吾人不能參加國際間惟與愛惜名譽之人舉行談判方爲有利何取乎不可信賴之人而與之共往來訂條約乎世界各國對於此等政府之榮譽心自當顧慮及之惟在此種空氣之中始能行到建設和平之方法</p>
<h3>國會改選藉覘民意</h3>
<p>現德國政府已解散衆院重行選舉以覘德國之民意世界各國當知德國政府酷愛和平顧全名譽之心理實能代表德國人民之同樣心理］又謂此舉所以使人民表示其信仰在歷史上將有重大價値政府使人民投票非僅使其贊成政府所採用之原則并使其深信此種原則而與之合而爲一</p>
<h3>誓爲平等名譽鬭</h3>
<p>希氏結論云［世界各國觀於此種表示必能深信德國政府與人民在爭平等及名譽之奮鬭中實團結一致德國政府與人民僅有一種希望即援助世界使慘痛之錯誤時代與可嘆惜之仇怨得以中止而世界文明最不關係之歐洲人民亦皆言歸於好而已］希氏演說係於晨間一時發出（當地鐘點）并譯成英法西班牙葡萄牙四國文字播送國外（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日内瓦如聞晴天霹靂</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）德國政府不再參加軍縮會議及退出國聯會之决定於軍縮會議主席團開會後約一點鐘之内送達國聯會此訊傳出與論大爲震動蓋事前一般人預料柏林政府决不至有如此驚人之抵抗及不滿意之表示也美國人士之失望及忿怒亦不在餘人之下並謂今日清晨德國在日内瓦之代表尙請美國代表從中設法使美代表台維斯及英代表西門行將發表之演說勿過於堅决致陷僵局英美兩或代表所以用恊調口氣爲德國說項者其故在此不料霹靂一聲德國忽宣布退出國聯會及軍縮會議自將後路截斷此誠出人意料之外者也按德國加入國聯會始於一九二六年九月十日（即羅卡洛條約訂立之後）此次退出國聯適在日本脫離國聯之後國聯受此嚴重之打擊其一切事務之進行均將遭遇障碍矣至於軍縮會議則由現在起即陷於極危難之地位然其形勢已十分明瞭按德國之參加軍縮會議原極勉强其與各國周旋於綠呢席上者不過欲達其政治上之目的耳並非有意與國際合作也目的不達即拂袖而去矣自今思之固極明顯者也（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>巴黎認爲局勢嚴重</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今夜法；官塲承認聞德國通知退出軍縮會議與國聯消息完全出於一驚</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>其願於評論此事者、多謂　已毋庸否認爲歐戰以來國聯所遇最惡劣之局勢、法報多料各國立將開始軍備競爭、但亦有信此時仍有與德成立恊定之希望、主張請英相麥唐納居間斡旋、開列强新會議以維和平云、（十四日國民社）</p>
<h3>美國調解盡成泡影</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　美政府覺德國之退出軍縮會議、實等於兩年來怒力商訂軍縮恊定之失敗、國務卿赫爾對於德人此舉、深爲痛惜、謂美國曾力求與出席日内瓦各國合作、以期培植友好與和平之精神、而免今日此類事件之發生、美國曾希望各國繼續討論、以達於解决之境、今德人此舉、不僅妨礙全部軍縮運動、或竟將使之中止、又從他方面聞悉、美國雖贊助英法反對德國之立即重行武裝、但關於日後在安全制度内之軍備平等權、亦曾努力謀致諒解云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>英政界抱鎭靜態度</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　英相麥唐納刻在鄕間别墅休憩、但已詳知時事今晚將返相邸、大約星期一日英内閣方有正式談話、英官塲對於軍縮難關之態度、依然鎭靜、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼緘默無言</h3>
<p>羅馬意相墨索里尼對於此事、緘默無言、但其他要員則公然自認彼等不知何所適從、如謂德國終爲不破壞四國公約、殊難置詞云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬意官塲今日否認意國將踵德國退出軍縮與國聯之說、謂係巴黎方面所揑造絶無根據且與墨索里尼抱恊同他國和平合作之主旨不符（十五國民電）</p>
<h3>德代表團襥被返國</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　自德國宣布退出國聯會及軍縮會議之後、軍縮會議德國代表團即於今晚離開日内瓦、啓程之前、即德國報界所派隨該國代表團來日内瓦之各記者亦不願接見、德代表團自稱、已無權表示德國意見、故接見報界殊屬無益、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>退出國聯早有準備</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德國退出國聯會軍縮會議之决定、自數日以來即已凖備就緒、此於德政府行動之迅速可以見之、德政府發表宣言、旣已敏捷矣、而同時以頒布法律、將憲法秩序根本加以改正、此種内部改組事宜、關係至爲重大、世人皆可見及、緣近來德國政府雖極端努力加緊宣傳、而德國人民境况未見有多大改善、德國人民不免爲之失望、希特勒總理爲轉移視線計、乃以驚人舉動、脫離國聯會、使民氣爲之一伸、希氏於退出國聯會之後、繼之以公民投票、可見其目的係欲在國内增進威信、德國政府又欲利用機會、擴大中央集權制、將德國政權完全置於匣社黨獨裁之下、而使德國家完全改變性質、至於外交問題、希氏必非有意决裂、由希氏所作演說可以見之、渠見日内瓦形勢、於德國不利特乘機退出耳、此間人士以爲德國退出軍縮會議之後、尙可利用四强條約以爲補救之計、不患無法可施、第四强條約係以國聯會盟約爲基礎、德國乃竟忽略之而宣告退出國聯會、則四强條約實亦無法援引此則希氏所未見及者也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>兩年後始發生效力</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　德國退出國聯與軍縮會議之决議、引起一般人之恐慌民衆爭向報販購閱載有項消息之特刋、普通人士對此消息、固爲之震駭、但留心政治者鑒於昨日德國在日内瓦不願有何讓步、已豫料其或有此舉矣、德國之退出國聯、在兩年内不能發生效力、但將如日本、不復遣派代表參加國聯之任何會議（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　今日可靠方面聲稱、德國之退出國際聯合會與軍縮會議、政府之意、係欲實在退出、不過一切當力求其圓滑耳、並謂德國在二年過渡期間、仍將恪遵一切規定、如照繳會費等是、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>國會改選對内策略</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德内閣得悉英外相西門在日内瓦演說之内容後、始作此重大之决議、閣議旣决定退出國聯、德總理希特勒乃立即入見興登堡總統、德總統對此决議、卒表同意、希特勒訴諸民衆之决議乃可使希氏獲有絶對大多數民衆贊助之一種策略、此不過僅詢問選民願否選舉國社黨候選員其實黨外人員皆不容入選也、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>法政府地位呈動搖</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　法政府之地位、或有受德國决議之累、因今晨内政所成立之財政計畫、現無通過之把握、果爾、則總理達拉第將辭職矣、德國此舉將使法國反對黨不贊成外長彭古軍縮政策者、獲有攻擊政府之新攻具法政府方面認時局爲嚴重、但其態度尙覺鎭定、彼等究不知德國徒作大言爲謀所讓步計乎、抑切實閉塞和平與調解之門乎、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>奧國增厚邊陲防務</h3>
<p>印斯白魯克　奧國因新與德人關於國家社會黨活動發生糾紛、故視德國之退出軍縮會議與國聯、或較歐洲其他國家爲嚴重維也納方面一接柏林消息後、立即下令加厚德奧邊境防務、顯似奧當道深慮邊境之發生衝突、目下各衝要地點、多新設鋼絲網、沿邊大道、派内衛團巡邏、各山徑小道向來不設防衛者、今亦派兵戍守、行旅過境、皆嚴加檢查、有時强其解衣、搜查有無秘密文件、一切汽車皆派機匠檢查、對於空車胎往往拆開察視、以防夾帶、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>各國輿論</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　全世界各地輿論、對於昨日在柏林及日内瓦所發生之事變、繼續有所評論、均表明世界政治上不安之象其由此所得結論、則極不一致但有一點爲全世界各國報紙所完全同意、即德國在國際團體中、陷於完全孤立是也、德國報紙對於此層、雖未明白指陳、究亦承認之、茲將各國報紙評論、摘述如下、</p>
<h3>英</h3>
<p>英國各報、提出一問題、即世界人士當以何項態度對付德國、星期泰晤士報主張簽訂一種軍縮公約、俾使德國益陷於孤立至必要時、則訴諸政治經濟財政上之制裁方法、德國若仍擴張軍備、（此層吾人認爲勢所必然）則除用武力以外、吾人苟欲强令國社黨政府放棄其旣定程序實屬徒然云、</p>
<h3>法</h3>
<p>［時報］評論德國對國聯會及軍縮會議之態度、略謂［十四年以來、爲建設各民族間之永久和平、各國人士孜孜工作、備歷艱辛、而其所得之結果、竟爲德國一掃而空、此德國不能不對全世界人類負其責任者也、然此舉於德國究有何益、德國欲阻撓軍縮公約之訂立、須知軍縮公約即使不成、尙有凡爾賽條約在、簽字各國决不使該約所載之條疑被人破壞也、柏林人士其知之乎、且英國樞密大臣鮑爾溫對伯明罕保守黨大會之演說、固明明警告德國者、柏林人士其未嘗了解乎、近所以來世界各國人士、對和平建設之信仰與日俱增、其希望國際恊和之念正濃、突覩德國今日之舉動、有不悲忿塡胸而思抵制者乎、軍縮會議經德國之阻撓、陷於失敗、則軍備競爭將繼踵而起、人類之危險將達於極點而德國之爲世界害、亦昭然若揭矣德國之害、非抱有至誠之人士同心恊力共謀自衛、固不足以消除之、國際形勢一變至此、吾知世界民族將不能爲德國當局恕也、</p>
<h3>美</h3>
<p>紐約方面對於時局似較他國更認爲嚴重、各報甚或以爲有武裝衝突之可能、其最所關心者、即美國政府對於歐洲各種問題、將採取何種態度是也、［紐約泰晤士報］紐約民聲報］均謂美國政府已决定竭盡其力、以挽救軍縮會議、［紐約泰晤士報］又謂德國重整軍備、無論是否屬實、美國却已站立於大戰時聯合各國方面］其他各報則主張採取中立態度懼中立以何項形式出之、則意見互有不同、美國官塲方面宣稱、美國可於嚴守中立與消極援助兩項政策之中任擇其一、所謂「消極援助政策」業經羅斯福總統加以解釋、即戰爭時各中立國有與各交戰國照常往來之權利、已爲世人所公認、此種種權利美國或可放棄云、此外華盛頓方面對於德國衆議院改選、認爲與目前政局毫無裨補、紐約民聲講壇報載稱、此項選舉實爲「可悲之滑稽劇」云、</p>
<h3>意</h3>
<p>意國各報紙對於德國所採態度、并無鮮明之表示、例如「意大利人民報」謂德國退出國聯會及軍縮會議、雖屬政治局勢一種推進、究不宜過分惶慮、且不必恐懼、其所引起之反響、又况此種局勢非無出路可尋、而最爲棘手之問題、亦可於國聯會及軍縮會議之外、圖謀解决乎、至於德國政府解散衆議院一事、其利益何在、殊難索解云、其他各報論調顯然相同、惟「使者報」别出心裁、謂昨日希特勒總理對於和平作有鄭重保證、不可不注意及云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奧</h3>
<p>奧京各報不利於德國各報、對於希特勒所稱道之和平主義表示懷疑、謂德國政府對於奧國不斷施行「詐僞政策」、無可取信之處、又謂德國此舉、即就該國本身利益而言、亦屬大錯大誤、新維也納報謂德國旣退出日内瓦自當重受凡爾賽和約之拘束聯邦郵報謂「德國退出軍縮會議之後、其他各國較爲自由」德國自陷於孤立、有何裨益云、</p>
<h3>波蘭</h3>
<p>政府機關報「晨報」載稱、「德國拍案而起、四强公約因而受致翕命之傷」、法國國會在目今情况之下、未必批准此約云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>瑞士</h3>
<p>國聯會機關報「民族日報」對於德國報紙所稱、希望在四强公約範圍以内進行談判一層、予以答覆、謂四强公約惟在國聯會範圍以内、乃可運用、現德國旣已退出國聯會、則四强公約已於昨日死亡云、「日内瓦講壇報」則謂「此次突發事件、反可使英法美三國連帶關係愈加密切、此外各報均謂時局雖嚴重、但較之以往實爲明晰」云、</p>
<h3>德</h3>
<p>（柏林）　德國各報對於大局之嚴重、均不作空論、惟謂門户今尙未全閉、柏林日報稱、希特勒之演說語調和緩、故甚有實力、克魯士報稱、德國人民現一心一德、立於總統與總理之後、德意志日報稱、希特勒之演說、爲德國人民之聲、伏錫志報謂希氏演說最佳之一段爲稱讚法總理達拉第抱公道之高尙思想數千萬德人對達氏近今所發演說中之言論、皆不勝感謝云、質言之、德報均不若外報之抱悲觀、而希望希特勒莊嚴務實之演說、能關最後諒解之途徑、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>日俄關係緊張　華盛頓密切注視　美與論鼓吹聯英制日</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　國務院因日俄關係愈益緊張、特發表宣言云、美國政府僅以注視爲事、此外一般人以爲冬令將屆、西伯利亞及滿洲地方嚴寒可畏、以故日俄兩國若能在未來四星期之内避免衝突、則其决裂機會、必因而大爲减少云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　星期泰晤士報載稱、歐洲戰事又將發生、德法兩國尙須經數世紀之衝突、歐戰再起、亦不過衝突中之又一幕而已、「此事美國無關、未便再加干涉、蓋以美國有與日本作戰之威脅、極須加以準備、尤不宜再度干涉、美國所當爲者、係與英國訂立同盟以防日本、而援助澳洲、至日本攻擊美國時、英國至少須以其海軍援助美國」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）　　（倫敦）　觀察報今日稱、遠東擾攘　中已顯露俄日之衝突、中東路論價之爭執、即其一事、但猶非雙方衝突之總因、國聯權利之不及於俄日、此亦無關重要、蓋國聯權利所能及之西歐、現亦處於惡劣之狀態中、該報又謂莫斯科現竭力結歡於波蘭法國、殆非偶然事也云云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國擴軍表示</h3>

<p>南村之行、亦可謂最前線之視察、村處羣山中、有一清溪、可灌良田、時晚禾已纍纍垂穗、蔚然深秀、高可没人、足見匪區田園、尙未如赤白交界區之荒蕪也、駐軍正於山巔趕築碉堡、村民盡則俯首助理、入暮即各閉户深居、　聞警號、亦弗願出、蓋若輩尙存觀望心理、故對清查户口、編制保甲等事、刻尙未便雷厲一行、區公所及義勇隊人員、夜晚聞亦難放野外步哨、因離此只五里許之廟下村、即設有僞縣蘇維埃政府、爲防匪之夜襲、只好扃户守之、食鹽火油、已由義勇隊向各用户　金公賣、食鹽每日人准購三錢、購時必　布製蓋印之執照、當日聞義勇隊西未赴城購鹽、已無鹽賣、購者失望而返、咸謂無鹽可食、其苦甚於無油燃燈云云、匪在該村分田兩次、先以田之面積爲標凖、每人約分得田二斗餘（約二三畝）、後改以收穫量爲標凖、上田作四石、中田作三石、下田作二石、每人分得田可收谷七石、每石百斤、應納屢進稅百分之六、計谷四十二斤、（他本有分谷八石者、則應納屢進稅百分之七、餘類推、但至多每人不得分過十五石、實際上亦從未聞分逾十石者）每石按時價作錢四千文、雇農貧農納稅時可全繳谷、中農谷錢各半、或聽自便富農則全繳錢、有時且抬價每石收至六千文、</p>
<p>匪區受封鎖影響之最大者、莫過於食鹽布匹二項之缺乏、縱以高價求之、亦不易得、去歲、匪曾效封鎖政策、禁止谷米荼油金屬煤礦木料等出口、嗣鑒於糯米可釀酒、非區可得善價、乃弛禁、繼而茶油煤礦等項、亦相繼弛禁、向外購買工業品以及日用必需品時、多由合作社包辦、將匪區農産品、以交易式而換得之、非不得已、則不輕用現金、</p>
<p>匪陷蓮縣多年、僅在城内鋪一石路建築某區堤壩、以興水利、城區收復調查、計匪曾辦列寗小學十三所、現列寗小學之列寗二字、已全被挖去、聞將逐漸興辦正式小學或改辦兒童反共團、以施特殊教育、石路則予以保留、以利交通、所築堤壩、因在某村上河、一般昔時逃外今日返家之難民、（多爲地主富紳）以該壩有傷風水、迭請縣府毀之、未蒙照准、蓋恐上河無數良田、將一變而爲眞正之赤土也、</p>
<p>曾經匪化之人民、似具特性三點、一爲不怕死、前幾次國軍進剿時、每到一地、彼等皆遠颺數十里外、鮮有敢冒險歸來者、今則稍逃村外、嗣知國軍能寬容、遽即聯袂偕歸、亦有敢越重圍尋仇讐、以取甫歸之難民首級者、浯塘村民、因割電線、曾被殺十數人以示儆、彼猶不怕、竟乘某連撤退之不備、以農具而槪繳其槍、致遭血洗之禍、前此曾感一度之米荒、派該村民赴匪區購糧、成往招徠親朋以及在彈雨中恊助搶築碉堡等等、無不挺身任之、其其</p>
<p>不怕死之勇敢性、有如此者、二爲殘忍性、殺人不算事、其例不勝枚舉、三爲創造性、臂之義勇隊隊長、及其他團體主要職位、農民竟敢與難民爭奪爭得之後、對厥職亦多能自出心裁、處之裕如、爭而失敗、則一變而爲搗亂心、使辦事人時感棘手、</p>
<p>匪軍對民衆訓練、素極注意、對兒童之組織訓練、尤爲嚴密認眞、其兒童團之十一字口號、爲［凖備着、時時刻刻的凖備着］、試細味之、即可燭其深意、記者嘗與曾加入兒童團之孩童談話、第一、覺彼等所答極流利、尤其對五一·五九·九一八·一二八等紀念日之意義、無不對答如流、談時若引用分曆幾年·帝國主義·資産階級等類名詞、其純熟更有如數家珍、列寗小學年用課書、初小僅有國語·唱歌·體操三科、高小則不知、年限無一定、得按成績以升降、專員公署、已將城區曾受匪化教育之兒童、組成兒童反共團、施以特殊教育、并曾派彼等查塡居民户口·職業等表格、因說話清順、工作努力、成績且在成人之上、</p>
<p>蓮城商舖、統計二六五家、中以藥店最少、計七家、生意頗好、最多者爲紙烟店、計一零五家、足見蓮民有嗜烟癖者之衆多現駐軍六十三師全師官兵·曁專員公署·縣政府全體辦事人員、均一律戒吸紙烟、以爲禁烟倡、并自九月一日起、嚴禁紙烟入境、以期戒除民衆之不良嗜好、查紙烟所用菸葉·錫包·紙壳等、多係舶來品、而製造公司、尤多外商經營、一倡百效、予以禁絶、蓋不僅民族健康、與有大益已也、</p>

<h3>經濟專家徐佩琨談　統制經濟問題</h3>
<p>統制經濟的名詞、近日甚　鏖上、同以前的種種新名詞誕生時、相映成趣、異曲而同工、迨過了相當時期、提倡的人們、便都銷聲匿跡、實際上當然是没有什麽結果、這種現象、可以說是我國唯一的通病、凡要　　一件事情的時候、大家都興高采烈、來熱閙一下、到了没有辦法的時間、不消說、便馬馬虎虎搪塞過去、現在全國高高興興的提倡統制經濟、全國的民衆、　然希望着這件事情成功、以豈統制經濟實現以後、工商事業、就可大大發展政府便有力量、解决民生問題、所可怕的、只恐怕重蹈覆轍、好像只聽到樓梯響、不見樓上人下來、講到統制經濟這個名詞、文字上是嶄新的、所以引起了文人的興味、實際是一個舊名詞、無論古今中外、可以胆大的說、没有一國不實施過統制經濟的、歐戰時、參與戰爭的國家、凡生産消費分配各項問題、絶對的受政府的節制、甚至吃一塊　包、買一斤精、也要得到政储的許可、現在的蘇俄、當然是采取這個方法、其他各國、平時也有許多統制的例予、銀行鐵路交易所及一切大企業都受政府的管轄與限制、我國提倡統制經濟、在表面上好像是一件最近的事情實際我國是實施統制經濟的老手、從古以來典當·剃頭店·荼肆·荳腐·等舖的開設、受政会與同業的嚴厲約束、在一條街上須有相當的距離、方准開設米鹽等消費、運輪·與販賣、也受以政府嚴厲的監督、鴉片問題、也在同樣禁例範圍以内、銅元的進出、有時也要受政府的干預、於此可見統制經濟是老手生常談、今天熱烈提倡這個問題、大槪因爲米麥棉等問題、關係過鉅、所以便注意到統制的問題、但以前討論米麥棉等問題、有好幾次、都包舍着統制的意義、　　起來說、統制經濟這個辦法、並不是新的、並且各國都有的、所要注意的、是實施統制經濟後的結果如何、統制經濟的意義與責任、統制經濟是一個舊辦法、上回已說過但是牠的範圍與意義、胥視　業之大小與　質爲轉移、简單的說、牠的意義與資任、便是　使生産消費與分配均有規則、使人們各得其所、自食其力、社會秩序安定、人民均可安居樂業然而要達到這個目的、解决民生問題的目標、首先要使生産發達、這要人人都有工作、義可獲得相當酬勞消費才可暢達、分配庶可求其平衡、這樣講來、統制經濟、是相負了解决全部民生問題的使命、當然是一件最困難的事情、總理在他實業計畫中、已規定了大企業爲國有、小企業爲民有、又規定了平均地權的辦法、都是統制經濟問題、但日實施起來、便感覺到許多困難、實施統制經濟的條件、統制經濟、旣負着解决民生問題的責任、其重要槪可想見、統制經濟旣是一個老辦法、而往往實施後之結果、適與希望相反、實施統制的困難、也就明瞭了、晚近工商企業之不能發展、全國經濟陷於絶境、確實證明我國無統捌辦法、而急須籌盡包羅萬象的整個統制策略但是這個策略、當牠是紙上談兵一樣的做法原來是一件極容易的事情、可是實際上、要牠一步一步的做起來、便可發生作用、發生效力、一貫的到達目的地、那就是一件千難萬難的事情、简單的講、要希望統制經濟能産生效力、首先要種種條件俱備、但是這種條件、是很難的和盤托出、因爲文字上與事實上、有許多隔謨的地方、無從表現、現在姑且臚列七種條件如次、以備參考、（一）正確的事實、（二）正當的理論根據、（三）透澈的經濟與商學知識、（四）各業富有經騐的專門人才、（五）富有企業設計與管理人才、（六）實施的人才、（七）充分經濟力量、</p>

<p>南洋巴達維亞華商陳百鵬君爲求切實調查國貨是否合銷南洋起見、特派陳毓秀君來滬、新聲社記者、昨訪之於旅次、作下列之談話、以告關心南洋貿易者、記者問、聽說南洋方面、華僑受着世界不景氣的影響、經濟衰落、不知道近况如何、陳君答、荷屬華僑商業的衰落、這是經濟基礎不穏固、華僑經濟基礎之所以不穏固的原因、雖有些人說是没有銀行等大企業、但鄙人以爲荷印華僑之所以失敗、原是他在商業上所佔據的地位不伜健全、因爲華僑都是中介商、他們以製造物推銷於銷費（土人）者同、時將原料生産者（土人）的原料、推銷於資本主義者、現在土人知識程度提高、資本主義者也因爲與土人相處日久、感情融洽、所以一切交易、都是直接銷售、無須華僑爲中介人、這是華僑没落的原因、此後如欲拯救華僑唯一的辦法、就是使華僑爲推銷本國貨的商人、而非專代外國資本主義者買賣貨物的中介商、那末華僑商業勢力、才有復興的一天、問日本在南洋的勢力和華僑比較如何、答照理、經濟衰落、是普遍的現象、日本人也該受影響、但是事實竟出人竟料之外、日本人在荷屬的事業、非但不退步、反而蒸蒸日上、這是什麽緣故呢、因爲兩洋市塲各種製造品的供給者、在那邊市塲、至少有百分之八十以上、荷印華僑、除經營土産者外、大都是日本貨的推銷商、這種推銷日貨的華僑、漸漸有被淘汰的危險、因爲日人受了國人和華僑抵貨運動的教訓、自九一八以後、他們模仿華僑、到處開設小小的雜貨店、專以日本貨直接售與土人、華僑勢力、漸有不能支持咧、問國貨在南洋市斱銷略如何、答說來可恥可得很、荷印有一百三十多萬華僑、但中國貨銷不上百之二三、日本人祗有五六千、日本貨却幾乎霸佔全市場、這是日貨廉價傾銷、無孔不入的原因、國貨之在南洋也不是華僑不努力推銷、第一、是中國工業落後、在這幾年來才有蓬勃氣象、但南洋市塲、已爲日貨捷足先登、第二、中國的工業中心、不幸而在上海、而華僑却多數的閩粵人、他們都不熟悉上海的情形、假如工廠設在厦門廣州或香港、國貨一定比較能夠多去、譬如香港出産的乾電池棉紗衫等、在南洋的銷路很有可觀、第三、上海的工廠、一向很少派人到南洋去推銷貨物、就是有人去的、又因爲語言不通、和不熟悉南洋地方情形、所以收效很少、第四、是上海廠家對於裝到南洋去的貨物、不甚留意、致推銷者要受重大損失、而且上海廠家多貪目前小利、不注意貨物的品質、譬如在荷銷路、原是很大的、但上海廠家不留意、拿壤漆去油傘到爪哇以後、因天氣酷熱、油漆融解、不易張开、因此上海雨傘的銷路、漸爲日木雨傘所奪、第五、中國商人、確實少一些愛國心、每以日貨冒充國貨、譬如三Ｇ和三Ｋ的襯衫、在爪哇原很暢銷、但有一般利令智昏的華僑、便把樣子寄到日本去仿造、因日價格較廉、致市塲爲擾亂、第以南洋方面對於國貨究竟缺少一些宣傳、假如多開幾次國貨展覽會、那未華僑自然、要注意國貨了、其次是多開幾家國貨商店、使華僑有購買國貨的機會、因爲現在完全做國貨生意的、眞是絶無僅有的、問閣下對於國貨推銷的意見如何、答最要緊的、是不可貪圖目前小利、提高貨物的品質、同時要注意宣傳工作、那末國貨推銷方面、一定很順利了、末後、據陳君說、我已由市商會介紹、參觀過許多工廠、倘使有其他各廠、要在南洋推銷貨品的話、可向市商會商品陳列所、代爲接洽云、</p>

<p>（南京十五日電）十五日下午四時、足球三賽、滬戰遼、裁判員周家騏、遼隊實力極有可觀、上場時滿場飛馳、滬隊頗窮於應付、且遼處順風地位時來攻犯、球多在滬隊門邊盤旋、周鐵門左右應付、連呼不得了、江善敬脚頭不準、徐亞輝時被搶去、李義臣陳家球踼不到球、遼隊此種意想不到之良好表演、四座歡呼之聲不絶、開球第三分鐘、李義臣帶球在内衛中踼入網内、首開紀錄、此後雙方劇烈鏖戰、久無勝負、至十五鐘、遼犯規被罰十二碼球、孫錦罰中一球、遼軍不自氣餒、仍抵抗到底、一時出兵爭攻、一次周賢言接住後、以風大球急失手、球飛落網後、相差寸許、否則殆矣、滬隊亦還以顔色、先得萬象華李義臣各中一球、上半時成四對零之比、</p>
<h3>發生互毆宣告中止</h3>

<h3>吳市長參觀足球</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）十五日下午足球三賽二塲、港對平、滬對遼、均極精采、觀衆近萬人、看台及四圍均滿、開足球塲未有紀錄、秩序頗亂、吳鐵城楊虎等亦往觀、站立甚久始去、</p>
<h3>三賽結果香港戰敗北平　結果三對一　上半三對零</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）十五日下午二時足球三賽、港以三對一勝平、獲得複賽權、裁判員陳吉祥、就實力而論、港較侵於平然平隊拚命精神、殊有足取、</p>
<h3>求勝太切行涉粗野</h3>
<p>開戰後、鏖戰良久、未有勝負、球時在平方盤旋、險象百出、至廿分鐘、港中鋒得球、直進内衛線、單槍匹馬、攻進一球、首奏奇功、未五分鐘、黄美順又獲球、平隊努力反攻、喊殺之聲、震動遠近、當時港軍行動、頗涉粗野右平左内鋒房歌春受傷出場、平守門亦被港軍拳打、于是全塲大譁、認爲舉動野蠻、應予警戒、經裁判員勸止、繼續比賽、平軍迭次反攻、均被包鋼門揮出界外、最後十分鐘時、港右鋒得球傳周中鋒輕輕一蹴、又落網内、上半時三對零、港勝、休息時間某攝影記者請港隊攝影、觀衆怱擁入場内、一服中山裝者大　港隊野蠻、不配比賽、更不必爲之攝影、言辭激昂、且有大聲喝打者、港隊當時態度甚洼、謂一切遵從裁判之命、卒未肇事、</p>
<h3>勇於改過和平勝利</h3>
<p>下半時、港軍改取守勢、亦不十分激烈搶球、而平方舉動、反有過火之處、其内衛復將港中鋒鄭季良踼傷、旋卽出場、港軍小心翼翼、勇於改過、觀衆亦漸鎭靜、至三十分鐘時港隊判罰十二碼球、被平唐國樑罰進一球、嗣後港全取敷衍延肯政策、平雖怠於反攻、終以防守嚴密、無懈可擊、加以包鋼門虎視耽耽、救出險球十一次、無法越雷池一步、下半時一對零、平勝、總分三對一、港軍得複賽權、</p>
<h3>觀衆失態挑撥情感</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）一般觀衆多不明事理、大聲喊嚷、甚至有呼奏他者右顯屬片面袒護舉動、且跡近挑撥兩隊感情、望大會注意此點、港平之戰、最初港隊進取心急、稍嫌激烈、後塲絶對和平、固談不到野蠻、字也</p>

<p>（南京十五日電）十五全日、紛擾未已、尤以八十八師兵士之行兇、及足球塲之糾紛爲更大、而足球塲紛擾之原因、實由於觀衆之妨忌滬隊所致、良以上海此番連得田徑全能等錦標、而於各項球類中、亦頗佔優越形勢、是以引起各方之醋意、每遇滬球隊出場輒有無意識之呌喊、尤以遼寗選手、不以失地而忘祖國、更引起羣衆、一同情、至於遼寗足球隊之技術、確甚可觀、成績進步良多、我人於一秉公正之態度、對勝者恭賀之、對失敗者勵之、我人當勝則爲榮、敗亦不辱、今選手不能以此自勉、而徒然斤斤於勝負之分、以至於意氣用事、實失原來競技之精神矣、平港足球之戰、亦有同樣事件發生、誠大會之大不幸、亦體育界之不幸、此風旣開、則大會後三日球類複賽時、大可杞憂、杰州全運之餘波未消、深望大會注意、以謀一圓滿之結束</p>

<h3>哈爾濱上塲即衰</h3>
<p>河北開賽、得一分、哈隊卽一蹶不振、靳淑基玉臂伸處、得分頻頻、哈隊王保蓉張樹芬好容易奪得四分、河北隊十六對四勝第一節、第二節哈隊表演較好、然河北畢竟較勝一籌、以二八比十勝上半時、</p>
<h3>靳淑荃益形矯健</h3>

<h3>北平聲勢仍壯</h3>
<p>下半時平隊聲勢依然、湖北雖由孫淑宜投入一球、於事無補、第三節終了、北平四十五、湖北七、第四節北平後備軍紛紛入場、形勢仍舊懸殊、湖北隊最第勢力、挽回四分、結果北平六十、湖北十一、</p>

<h3>滬川晋平複賽　十七日開始</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）女網球次賽結束、滬晋川平得複賽權、十五日午後二時起、女網球繼續比賽、次賽已全部結束、結果滬三比零全勝皖、晋川均以二對一淘汰京冀各次賽中輪定、故滬晋川具得複賽權、將於十七日複賽、</p>
<p>（南京十五日電）女網球次賽、滬茅於文、皖劉毓芳、川鮑大經挫冀、崔書貞、晋王春菁勝京劉玉蘭、女網球得次賽權者計有滬皖川冀晋京平七單位、十五晨九時開始比賽、第一單打滬對、皖川對冀、晋對京、平輪空結果滬川晋各得一單打、</p>
<h3>上海稱雄全勝安徽　結果三比零</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）滬皖之戰、皖於初賽中與閩對敵、閩僅有二選手參加雙打賽、兩單打完全棄權與皖、而閩雙打則勝皖、故皖之能得次賽權者純係機會造成、其實力不過爾爾、次賽與滬相遇、滬人才平均、第一單打茅於文球藝尤佳、皖劉毓芳遠非其敵、故形成一面倒之局面、結果茅於文連以兩個六比一勝、</p>
<p>滬已得第一單打賽、皖棄權、第二單打、滬夏蘭徵勝皖孫思蘭、比數六比二、七比五、於是滬以三對零全勝</p>
<h3>山西厲害淘汰南京　結果二比一</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）晋京之戰、晋王春菁球藝純熟、鎭定異常、惜球出無力、其致勝之由、全在兩角抽球之準確、使對方疲於奔走、坐視其敗耳、十五對京劉玉蘭之賽、王亦以此獲勝、比數六比四、六比一、王連得兩盤、</p>
<p>（又電）京晋雙打賽、於午後二時起賽、晋孫貴秀常士熙球術軟弱、一無可取、京陳清陳希鮑、合作尙佳、藝亦平平、不過較晋稍優、故兩盤結果、京均以六比一勝、第二單打、爲京晋勝負關鍵、蓋晋於上午已得一單打、故雙方競爭甚烈、晋王春葳球藝嫻熟、反手尤佳、且鎭定一如乃姊春菁、京黃山農抽殺有勁、藝甚可觀、是賽極有得勝之可能、但因小心過分、坐失良機、卒以七比九三比六連失兩盤、由是晋遂以二比一淘汰京、而得複賽權、</p>
<h3>四川努力戰勝河北　結果二比一</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）川冀之戰、是賽局勢較爲緊張、川鮑大經抽殺厲害、但冀崔書貞亦抵禦甚烈、第一盤鮑僅以六與四之比獲勝、第二盤鮑一帆風順、崔則招架爲難、結果、鮑又以六比一勝、</p>
<p>（又電）川冀之雙打及第二單打、均因一方棄權、未有比賽、蓋川僅有二代表參加、當然雙方棄權與冀、而冀京祗有三選手、旣賽第一單打、雙打爲大會規定第二單打、亦不得不棄權與川、但上午川已勝一單打、川乃以二比一淘汰冀、卽獲複賽權、</p>

<h3>全場大震京五虎力戰勝菲僑　結果三七比十九　　菲隊吃軟不吃硬　河北頑强四七比二九擊敗福建</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）男籃球十五日晨九時起二場次賽、籃球場擠滿觀衆、水洩不通、球塲在底面平地如釜、然此爲開幕第一次盛况、良以出場四隊、俱屬勁旅、尤以南京對菲僑一戰、吸引力最大、南京合軍校青光兩隊虎將、實力不下河北、菲隊吃軟不吃硬、與京隊比較、不免减色、結果南京以三七比十九勝菲僑、河北四七比二九勝福建、京冀二隊相會於複賽、將演成空前未有之大劇戰、</p>
<h3>河北輕取福建　左右逢源</h3>
<p>第一塲河北對福建開始時、福建一鼓作氣、頑强抵抗、形勢尙見平均、但福建連續四次犯規、枼於葉茂發一人、故葉上塲不久、卽被罰出塲、往後福建一蹶不振、河北個個勇猛善鬥、雖不時調補陣容、始終緊張、左右逢源、得心應手、分數扶搖直上、以十九比四佔先、楊錫爵爲福建爭得二分、後又成二五比六、上半時終了、河北以二七比十勝、</p>
<h3>風調雨順</h3>
<p>檸檬過後、福建先發制人、氣燄旺盛、陳宗標連得二籃、楊錫爵吳義成各有建樹、河北尹鴻祥屢建奇功、形勢頗爲平衡、惟雙方時有調換、使局勢弛懈、减少興趣、河北風調雨順、一路佔先、分數相差常在二十左右、福建雖敗、但下半時之表演、大有可觀、故錫爵得分甚多最後結果、河北以四七比二九勝、裁判舒鴻佟復然、</p>

<h3>菲僑苦戰失利　輕敵失勢</h3>
<p>第二塲爲海外菲僑對南京、受觀衆熱烈之助陣、南京人員高大、糾糾雄夫、頑强非凡而於最後十分鐘之百步穿揚、尤有意想不到之妙、菲隊吃虧於軟弱、投籃方面、毫無把握、與日前戰江蘇時之情形、異如　壤、京咸壯懷李公瑜魏海青王士選最爲出色、菲隊楊氏昆仲受人監視殊少活動、更加投籃不準十不得一、遂致一敗塗地、京以三七比十九勝、開始逐鹿、菲僑以爲南京實力平平、先將預備員上塲、以試探京之虚實、但處處受人控制、殊少活動、自京以六比一勝後</p>
<h3>局面漸轉</h3>
<p>大起恐怖、乃將正式陣線上塲、從此局勢緊張、厮殺愈烈、菲隊急圖上進、南京不稍示弱、吃緊工作、互少建樹、京後防森嚴、菲無機可圖、而咸壯懷王士選則屢爲南京得分、菲雖一度上進至五比八僅差南京三分、終以八比十七失利於上半時、菲隊振作精神、謀下半時間報復上場鋒茫頗露、林傲溜力爭五分、楊淑芬撲進一只、比數曾一度進至十五比十八、十七比二十、又差南京三分、</p>
<h3>壯志未酬</h3>
<p>以爲不難後來居上、但南京豈肯示弱、轉眼之聞、形勢忽又一變、咸李公瑜　擲命中、神妙之至、博得觀衆采聲不少、菲隊困於虎牢、無計可施、自海外不遠萬里而來之菲僑、卒遭淘汰、未免可惜、結果南京以三七比十九勝、南京於複賽中將滬河北、殊可注意、</p>

<p>江蘇隊爲一省精華、東吳份子爲中堅、輔以大同體大健將、初賽時、大露頭角、在廣東開賽之前、雄心勃勃、開球廣東蘇祖蔭發球、客氣禮讓三分、直至三比五時、前　三將始動殺心、托球到網、順手殺去、巧妙非常分數乃成各七時、看台督戰这諸色人等、連呼再來、球乃不期應聲瀉入江蘇前場、廣東十一、江蘇八分、易地再戰、江蘇見來球硬而且快、閂門失效、陣綫散漫不堪、轉碾失敗終致落空、廣東以念一比九殺得江蘇鮮血流漓、第二局江蘇急圖恢復失地、但心急手亂、失誤連連、廣東一鼓而得八分、嗣後廣東前排觸網犯規、江蘇生收漁利、上半場爲十一比八、廣不仍佔優勢、下半場一面倒、更爲利害、以念一比九而終、三局江蘇反攻不懈、前後跳躍、不肯放鬆一步、分數遂與廣東若接若離、彩聲雷動、陳汝時發球得力、崔鴻歡壓球神武、惜乎機會無多、以念一對十八終塲、總結果爲三對零、江蘇慘敗、裁判員李雲飛、</p>

<h3>浙江取巧終克强敵</h3>

<h3>廣不與香港之爭　游泳池大小</h3>
<p>— 老大</p>
<p>該池長爲五○米、　爲二十米、全爲馬其克造成、潔白美觀、一次可容九人比賽、爲我國第一大泳池、池之二岸、除有運動員休養處外、置有平跳二方、二邊空地每十餘呎、看台以梯階式、闊約二尺、其半爲水泥、一半爲青草長凡六十餘米、每邊有十餘級、可容千餘人、池之一端、爲更衣室淋雨浴辦事處、藥水池、入泳之先、必須經以藥水洗身足、卽可入池、並須由衛生處檢騐體格衛生極爲嚴厲、惜者泳後、無温水淋浴、亦爲美中不足、</p>
<h3>練習之勤奮</h3>
<p>游泳比賽日期逼近、於十月十日起、各省市參加游泳選手、每晨至暮分時練習、連日天氣入寒、各選手大呼太冷太冷不止、惟史氏弟兄練習最勤、日必二次、每次必在一時以上、槪其由此而成功也、</p>

<p>二，五○米自由式、（一）（二）（三）廣東陳振興、陳其松、劉寶希競爭必烈、成績因天氣較冷、未見出色、預測一名、二十九秒餘、二名三○秒、三名三○秒五、第四名、廣東王秀山、上海温敬令、余學邦、徐亨、均有希望、</p>
<p>三，五○米自由式（女）香港楊秀瓊必獲第一、成績在三三秒之内外、可謂無敵、女子之個人錦標、必歸其所有、第二名、以廣東陳玉輝成績較約三六秒内外、第三四名以香港梁詠嫻·劉桂玲·袁佩璋、廣東伍舜英爭奪、成績三七秒左右云、</p>
<p>四，四○○米自由式陳其松·史興隲、香港郭振恒有三名希望、史興陸·周達雲·爭其四名成績六分内外、可破黃源六分八秒八之全國紀錄、</p>

<p>六，一○○米仰泳（女）香港楊秀瓊必獲首席、第二三名以廣東袁佩璋、香港劉桂玲、按練習成績、似袁較劉爲隲、惟袁怕冷、上下之爭、尙需視天氣之和暖與否、第四名廣東陳玉輝、上海襲希及有望、</p>
<p>七，二百米俯泳上楊元華創三分二三秒之紀錄、而香港廣東較也成績、是以冠軍香港郭振恒成績三分左右、王新耀民三分六·七、第三四名、爲廣東鮑勵、上海楊元華、成績三分二○之間、</p>
<p>八，一○○米自由式（一）陳振興、（二）陳其松、第三四名王秀山、劉寶希、温敬令余學邦爭一先後云、</p>
<p>九，一○○米自由式（女）（一）楊秀瓊、（二）陳玉輝、（三）伍舜英、成績一分二五左右、第四名香港楊秀珍上海陳寶璇有望、</p>
<p>十，二○○俯泳（女）（一）爲楊秀瓊無問題、其他劉桂珍袁佩嫻、上海胡其瑗及廣東劉素　均有劇戰、成績四分以外、</p>

<h3>此次網球競賽方法惡劣　單打球員不能兼作雙打　第一第二單打又不規定　開賽以來棄權者不可計　果而從中取巧無法處理</h3>
<p>（南京十五日電）男女網球比賽、分單打兩組雙打、此種辦法、固未管不可、但單打選手、偿得兼雙打、此點使人材缺少或限於其他原由、不能多派代表之單位、感覺許多不便、故自開賽以來、棄權者日有數起、但遇單打各勝一組時、勢必在雙打中判分最後勝利、而雙方又無其他之雙打選手時、勢必雙方棄權、則此組勝負、將如何解决、却爲一極困難之問題、而大會當初、竟未能顧及主其事者、實種下禍根、可謂無頭腦之極、辦事之玩怱、於此益顯、又單打旣不能兼雙打、而第一第二單打選手、亦無規定、如明明爲第一單打選手、假如取巧、有意改爲第二單打、而將正式之第二單打升爲第一單打、故意使比賽之勝負、必須在雙打中解决、而一方面則無雙打選手、而、只能棄權、於是一方當然獲勝、此雖有關運動道德、純屬理想、但亦爲極可能之事、設或一旦發生此種事實大會主持者、將何以處之、總之此次大會主持者之全無經騐、實未可諱言也、</p>

<h3>馬介甫與陸判官</h3>
<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>馬介甫與陸判官，這兩個名字，是看過聊齋的，大槪都知道。事實是這樣的··</p>
<p>馬介甫與楊萬石爲密友，萬石生性怕老婆，怕的太利害了，連馬介甫都看不過去，　給他服一劑丈夫再造散，果然克服對方。不幸藥力散後在，萬石依舊作跪踏板生活。</p>
<p>陸判官與朱爾旦爲密友，爾旦因爲文章做的太　脚了，陸判官就在陰曹揀了一個玲瓏七　的心，替他換上，果然文思大進；爾旦又嫌他妻子的面孔生得不好看，陸判官就在陽間揀了一個容顔絶代的頭，替她換上，又果然顧盼生姿。</p>
<p>由此可知，馬介甫的方法，不及陸判官多：一個是只教他興奮一時，而結果是萎頓如初；一個是徹底改革，而結果是永遠斷根。</p>
<p>我們中國人，正患着萎頓的病，偏偏遇到馬介甫，只會給他服再造散，而没有遇到陸判官，來替他換心革面，弄得一個紙老虎，完全被對方戰穿。</p>
<p>而且我們服的再造散，比楊萬石多而又多：以前的五月九日，服過一劑；五月三十日，服過一劑：五月三日，服過一劑：最近的九月十八日，又服過一劑。繼服下去時，文官宣言團結；武將通電請纓；商人聲稱抵貨，而學生哩，更了不得，穿起軍服，肩起長槍，來做後備兵了。好像楊萬石拿刀割他老婆兩塊肉後，猶自餘怒未息一樣。但是五分鐘後，藥的效力不望上冲，反往下洩，結果楊萬石依舊跪在踏板前，而我們的文官，武將，商人，學生也依舊毫無生氣。</p>
<p>從此以後，我們可不要再服馬介甫的丈夫再造散了，還是請陸判官來換心革面吧！</p>
<h3>鬼也摩登</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>現在的時勢，做人固然要［摩登化］。說話要摩登，裝飾要摩登，以及起居飲食，一切的一切，都要力求摩登。那末，　合着［現代上等士女，漂亮人物］的資格。否時便是［腐化份子］，是［時代之落伍者］。所以這幾年來，人們都感着摩登狂。摩登二字，曾風行一時。現在還推而廣之，做鬼也要摩登化了。不信，且看前幾天報紙上刋着ＸＸ殯儀館的廣告。内容是這樣說：</p>
<p>藝術化，富麗美觀之壽器，每具售洋Ｘ千Ｘ百ＸＸＸ元，殮殯手續費，Ｘ百Ｘ十元。如只購壽器亦可：此壽器僅兩塊挖成，精工巧製，式樣摩登，可證永不腐朽。……</p>
<p>摩登的頭銜，用在棺材上面，好像是破題兒第一遭。大可以謅兩名詩：呌做［身入此棺中，做鬼也摩登］。還可以掉幾句文道∶［旣盡美矣，又盡善焉，可謂樂在其中。死而不瞑目者，未之有也</p>
<p>］。這樣摩登新式的棺材，當然要有錢的摩登人物，可以享用。雖則一棺附身，萬不都了，說什麽摩登不摩登。但是孔老夫子也有［祭如在］的明訓，昭示後人。足見人鬼要平等：一個人在活的時候，好講摩登，夜間還要睡着摩登新式的床。到了死後，也應該睡那摩登新式的棺。這纔好算是［始終如一，雖死猶生］。</p>
<p>再講到我國的壽器：數千年來，墨守舊章，不知改良。木料雖然也有貴重的，但形式陳腐，毫無美惹。名喚壽器，眞富於［壽］的色彩，使人見了不觀。現在好了，棺材也要特别改良，講摩登化了。我看此風一開，將來互相效法，摩登棺材店］，勢必接踵而起。把各種新式壽器，分類陳列。或者開一個［壽器展覽會］，任人參觀。再摩登些，索性［大减價二十一天］。到了那時，說不定要門庭如市，觀者雲集］咧！</p>
<h3>漫話漫畫</h3>
<p>— （錢澐作文楝良作畫）</p>
<p>—中國脾氣—</p>
<p>馬路上一個賣襪子的小販，因爲買客回價太小，由面現怒色而致出口漫駡，買客怕事，反身悄避，越走遠，駡聲越響亮，大槪恐被駡著聽不到，許多旁觀得嘻嘻笑。</p>
<p>會見來了西捕，他不及把包袱背走，抓住了給一頓打，這是違章的，他默然受打，隨後哀求，許多旁觀者嘻嘻笑。</p>
<p>後來終於捉進捕房，戲劇似的完　後，衆人無熱閙可觀，才懶洋洋散走。</p>
<p>先時没有人駡小販對待買主兇橫而不平，後來也没有人向西捕勸解。這許旁觀者祇是始終旁觀。始終嘻嘻笑笑。</p>

<p>在軍營裏的騾馬，它們對於戰事來到也另有一種銳敏的感覺，當那很快的風，橫過天空的時候，鳴吼吼的馬嘶聲，多烽帶些悚人毛髮的意味在内。趙自强聽了這種聲音，心裏頭說不出來，有一種什麽樣子的感慨。更覺得自已如此怱怱的出發，丢下了老父在海甸，專一去敷衍楊氏母女，也是自已庸人自擾的一件事，這應當先去和父親商量商量，也好讓他寬心，這個時候，正好抽出身來跑上一趟，營裏雖然走開了兩個排長，自已自限着的小時的來往，大槪也不至於誤事於是對上士司務長各打了一個抬呼，自已就走出營來。這時，太陽遍到西山頂上去，只有一丈來高。那一碧無際的麥田上，却搽上了一陣金黃色的陽光。平原上的東南風，不是那樣温和了在斜陽這裏面，吹到人身上有些凉颼颼的。遠望着那些矮小的人家，似乎有些像大陸上沉下去的形勢。一個人在大路上走着那鞋底在石灰道上走去有些撲撲作嚮。可是在一個人走路的時候，這嚮聲不但是增加不了熱閙，反是添上了許多寂寞。趙自强想着我打算結婚以後，每日走過這路一遍，這或了妄想了，當兵有什麽意思，身子是人家的，生命也是人家的，今天走了這條路一遍也許永不再走這條路了。把這種心裏的話對父親去說，猜猜父親多難過，把這話對楊桂枝去說，也又當怎樣？女人的眼淚是容易原恐怕非哭暈去不可！不，也許是恨我一點眼淚也不流。嗐！呌我見了他們，這種苦懷，却是怎樣的去說呢？他越想是越把步子走緩了，只那風吹着麥苗，瑟瑟有聲，震動他心靈上的寂寞。忽然，身後嘩嘩一陣銅號嚮，他猛然，止住了步子，他就不回家了。（二一三）</p>

<h3>笑的總動員</h3>
<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>同瓶未相憐同類郤相殘</p>
<p>有一次，軍艦行下水禮，柬請某部長太太行擲瓶禮。這位太太曾經受過教育洗禮的，動有動便要養人答答，當着大衆擲破香檳酒瓶，是列女傳及閨門女訓中所没有的，當然伊又要羞人答答了。太太旣不肯參加擲瓶典禮，没奈何便由某部長派了一位女職員去恭代太太行擲瓶禮。這位女職員，又正日一個嬌滴滴的紅花瓶，接了這個摩登使命，很高興地去參加了，及到擲瓶回來，有一個向伊說貫笑話的男職員，笑嘻嘻的說道：［紅花瓶擲破香檳酒瓶，不是同瓶相憐，竟是同類相殘了。］、聞者大笑，笑得紅花瓶面上通紅，直紅到花瓶耳朶上面。</p>
<p>被揩油的書畫家</p>
<p>書畫家一經成名，便有許多親戚故舊向他們揩油，或出半費，或者一毛不拔。偶然揩油，還覺情有可原，最可恨的，一而再，</p>
<p>再而三，揩個不休，便教書畫家也難於應命也。此種揩油舉動，書畫家名之曰［超］，倘然屢超不休，畫家替他們書聯，往往嵌一句詩品上的［超以象外。］畫家替他們作畫，往往繪一隻大水盂，水盂上露出一截超柄，這都是［取瑟而歌］的意思，好教他們一超以後，不來再超。聽得有某甲託人繪一個古裝美女，言明十塊錢，待到先付潤金，他只肯付五塊錢。畫家偏替他繪一個露出半面的徐妃。某甲不悅道：［古裝美人很多，爲什麽只繪這半面妝的徐妃。一畫家笑道：［你出的潤資，也日一個半面妝。］又有某乙託人畫扇，一毛不拔，第二次又託那人畫扇了。那人寫了一首唐詩，落去了四個字。寫的是：［去年今日此門中，桃花相映紅：不知何處去？桃花依舊笑春風。］某乙道：［先生錯了，第二句落去人面二字，第三句也落去人面二字。］書家笑道：［你原來也要面孔的麽？我只道你兩次都不要臉，所以替你落去了兩個人面。</p>
<p>花生米的裸體運動</p>
<p>最近裸體運動，到底一個辦不到。休說人有羞恥觀念，便是没有羞恥觀念的花生米，剝去了一層大衣，還留着一件着體的褪紅襯衫。不肯一古腦兒剝個乾凈。也有一種出白的花生米，剝得一絲不掛：但是，容易還潮，容易减少香味，總不及留着襯衣的花生米，來得適口。所以花生米的裸體運動，大有失敗的狀態。現交八月，糖炒栗子上市了。良鄉栗子是很開通的姑娘，輕輕一撚，外衫内衣，都剝得一乾二凈了。我前日吃着一個本地栗子，剝去了外衫。休想可以剝去它的内衣，後來硬着手腕，勉强剝去，把那栗了的肉都搯去一層，我說：這個栗子，拒絶剝去内衣，情願肌膚碎裂，倒有古時的烈女態度，我竟失敬了。</p>

<h3>焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷　（續）</h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>用絲茶兩項來比例，中國藥業，一天一天一天飯碗减少破碎下去的事：料道是一定有到達寂落下去的事；同時靠着藥業生活的人一天一一的是子。但是，絲茶衰落的救濟法，除用科　　法　　　以　　　　　　　　生　　　　業衰落，　用我所　出的方法來救濟之外，那理　再有生路可走呢？我的救濟方法，曾發表在社會醫報第一頁八十四號，是本年二月十六日出版的國産藥物專號，論　是［我國藥的問題之根本工作，］所主張的四項辦法；第一是移　外藥，第二是製造原料，第三是國藥之科學研究，第四是國藥之明證觀察。果然青照這樣向科學路上努力猛進，還怕錆入價額及失業人口邀增麽？唉！焦先生吓！只要看準了目標，努力去做，不怕没有妥善的辦法，隨時隨地，都可以補救損失，防止流弊，爲什麽定要開倒事，走死路呢？</p>
<p>所以據我看來，無論從學術成　看，從醫生分配看，更從國民經濟看，廢止國醫，顯然是有極大的利益而毫無妨碍的事情。</p>
<p>焦先生說：［國醫之實騐主義，處處表現事實於人們，這顯然自有其物質的立足點，只要運用科學方法，把他解釋起來，自不難成爲有系統的學術。］據我上　　說，國醫的實騐主義招牌，是虚僞的新頭銜。所表現的事實，從學理上探討起來，是逃不出［幸中偶合］四個字的範圍。物質文明不進步的國醫，當然没有在物質的立足點。運用科學方式解釋起來，賽如，鄉下老婆婆穿高跟皮鞋，成了一種世界的怪物，談不到學術兩個字。</p>
<p>焦先生吓，科學固然要有系統，但是有系統的不一定可冒充科學，舊有的星相醫卜，五行生尅的說，系世相仍，萬人同調，不能說他是没有系統，只是没有科學根據，所以在現代是不成其爲學術了。整個的貴國醫，已經是破碎得不堪，已經在［用科學的方式整理］聲中宣告滅亡了，就是焦先生，也不能不承認玄學一部分應該放棄但是破碎之後，滅亡之後，所剩下來的一鱗一爪，能否在科學世界裡面容納進去，這是要看此後科學家研究出來的成績如何爲斷。成績好的，當然可以存在，成績不好的，當然同歸於盡。國醫術的命運，只是如此，所可希望的，也只是如此，我們要想發揮國光的，也只有如此做去，還有一點可能性。所以要想爲國醫術盡點心力的人，只有懲恿科學家來研究，這纔是破碎滅亡後一鱗一爪的出路。不從研究着手，浮淺地拿點科學皮毛，來穿鑿附會地解釋一下，無論做成了怎樣有系統，是没中用的啊。焦先生的主張：是完全爲貴國醫人的問題，定了瞞過一時耳目，苟延殘喘的下策；不是爲學的問題，計劃永久存，　　不麽的遠謀。</p>
<p>焦先生說：［叵耐政府没有深切的對他注意，寗可讓東西洋國家，設立漢醫講座，提倡研究，國内教育學制系統上，竟没有國醫的一個地位。］焦先生要明白！不是國醫在教育系統上没有地位，是玄學在教育系統上没有地位，是世界醫學科學醫學之外，絶對不有國醫存在之可能，當然没有地位。現在很有幾個私立的國醫學校，請焦先生拿出他們講義來宣布宣布，到底適合不適合現代的教育？國醫治病的所以然，固然是莫明其妙，退一步說，知其所以然了，據焦先生的诰話，是不能告人的。那末，立在講臺上，不過朝着學生望就完了，請問怎樣教育青所？焦先生吓！東西洋國家的設立漢醫學講座，是設立在科學醫家手裡，是要消化漢醫在科學醫裡面，是科學醫的一個分科。貴國醫館的主張，是要把科學整理主權放在玄學家手裡，是要附會科學在玄學表面，是要在科學醫之外獨立。東西洋國家是科學醫訓練完成後之學者，才許做研究生，指導的人，更在其上。貴國醫館的主張，是教毫無科學素養的國醫，來裝飾科學門面，領袖的人，更出其下。東西洋國，並没有在醫學校之外，另立漢醫學校，也没有在醫師之外，另有漢醫人物。貴國醫館的主張，是要在教育系統上另闢一個地位，是要在科學醫之外另有國醫人物。東西洋國家，完全是學理上的研究。貴國醫館的主張，完全是業務上的排擠。目的，行爲，策略，背景，完全有同，虧你老人家引得出來做比例。</p>
<p>焦先生說：一再着業務方面，國醫治病，不能不說是屬於衛生的事情，却是衛生行政機關，竟無主管國醫的戰官，遇有問題發生，隨意教不懂國醫的人員去解决。比如兩三月前，上海國醫公會和上海國醫分館發生糾紛，控到行政院，擬批交衛生署核議，醫學誠然是衛生的事體，但中國的衛生署，根本不認識國有醫事，教他從何核議起？立法院通過西醫條例時，衛生當局，聲明不久更提國醫條例，乃該項條例，迄久未見擬訂，中央有鑒於國醫之管理，非常迫切，因於二十年間，先設立中央國醫館·嗣後，於本年六月間，擬訂國醫條例。向霏</p>
<p>例，中央政治會議，對於未經通過之案，事先</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>宣布者，懸爲厲禁，不知天津大公報醫學副刋，用何種手段，將該項草案先期揭載，並曲事詆毀，以爲國醫館之設立，破壞衛生行政系統。國醫館之破壞衛生行政系統，誠如所說，而不知中國之衛生行政系統，本不完備，不惟衛生行政系統不完備，教育學制系統亦未完　，國醫館使命，在學術方面，是補救教育學制系統的缺憾，在業務方面，是補救衛生行政的缺憾。］焦先生旣然曉独國醫治病，是屬於衛生，應該把管理貴國醫的事，完全交給衛生署，爲什麽要出此破壞手段呢？衛生署没有主管的職官，你老人家可以勸告，可以提議，教他添設。在國醫未曾完全廢止以前，當然應該管理，國醫條例迄未久擬，你老人家可以催促，爲什麽要出此破壞手段呢？衛生教育不完備，你老人家同在政府，同在中央，應該謁誠盡忠，扶助他們，彌縫缺憾，達到完備地步，爲什麽幸災樂禍，要另立機關，來破壞他們，做出政客爭權奪利的醜劇呢？據焦先生的意見，教育部的缺憾，不過在不教醫學院添設國醫講座，如焦先生以爲西醫界中　有擔當的人材，那末，只要貴國醫們有膽量，有本領，去擔當這個講座，我一準負起請願的責任，請求他們設立國醫講座，來延聘貴國醫充當教授。但切不可走進研究室，見了顯微鏡，試騐管，種種優良器械，目定口呆，手足無措，閙出笑話來就是了。衛生部的缺憾，不過是國醫條例迄久未擬，和没有主管職員，關於者，我們中華民國醫藥學會，已經有了呈文，貢獻到立法，行政院，和中央政治會議，催促他們應該早點把這個條例擬定，那時候，自然有主管官職出現，要想做官的，不妨硬薦一兩人進去，占一席，自然可以核議國醫所發生的問題了。我以爲很有正路可走，爲什麽要另立機關，破壞行政系統呢？眞是百思不得其解。</p>
<p>焦先生這段妙文中，忽而叵耐政府没有深切注意，忽而中央胡鑒國醫管理非常迫切，請問中央是不是政府？政府是不是中央？好像教育部衛生署是屬於政府，不屬於中央的，國醫館是屬於中央，而不屬於政府的，顯然　該政出多門，事無定向的弱點，怪不得被人家　做無組織的國家。似乎做立法院法制委員長的焦先生身分，不應該說出這種話！</p>
<p>還有［西醫］兩個字，極其不邇，科學的醫學，到了現在，是全球舉行，世界一致的學術，那裡還有東西南北可以區别？若說溯其來源，何以今日奉行的太陽歷，不呌做西歷，反而呌起國歷來呢？何以掮槍，架砲，駕飛機，乘兵艦的軍隊，不呌做西軍呢？郵政完全倣傚西洋，何以不呌西郵呢？民聞的舊式信局，何以不請出來呌他做國郵呢？法律方式，完全變成西式，何以不呌做西法呢？舊有的刑名錢轂老夫子，何以不請出來呌做國法呢？教育中生數理化等等，何以不照前清光緒年間的舊稱呼，呌做西學呢？西醫兩個字，何以輩獨要恢復光緒年間舊名呢？老實對國人說，衛生署的西醫條例，原名是呌做醫師條例，到了立法院，忽然把醫師二字，改了極其不通的西醫二了，這因爲立法院當中，有一班，心思狹隘，的國醫們，在裡面做官，才會閙出這種笑話，早已於科學醫之外，豫爲國醫占地步，至少限度，在這個名稱上面，洩洩鬱悶，快快心地，不管什麽通不通，且把今日之事我爲政的威福，盡量發揮一下再說。唉！焦先生吓！學問是要眞本事實力量的，　着虚僞宣傳，詭計簛弄，卽使瞞過一時的耳，得了一日的勝利，不過是夕陽返照，前途只有消滅兩個字恭候着，加上一百個國字也不中用。科學的實力，一天膨脤一天，加上百個西字，也壓迫不倒。莊子說得好，［名者實之賓，吾將爲賓乎？］</p>
<p>再，國醫條例的油印物，我處也有，交給我的人說，是從分館方面拿來的，很容易到手，大公報恐怕不是得是用什麽手段罷！我商榷到這裡，看看焦先生的原文，只剩餘二百多字，并且越說越没有理性，都可以依着上文的商榷，迎刃而解，我就此擱筆了。……（完）</p>
<h3>爲有志革新中國醫藥者進一忠告（一）</h3>
<p>— 周莎</p>
<p>自我論舊醫教育。涉及［中醫學校某高材生致函余雲岫君備道欽仰引爲師承］後。即有周莎君寄我一函。内述致書余君者即伊。且對我所論。認爲洞鑒舊醫界廢結。並附來一稿囑爲轉載。其文　達。其見卓越。可佩也。原文曾載於國醫評論第四期。該書着者。大率皆清新明覺類周君。而曾受中醫學校教育者。夫我國舊醫。本以神秘泛論。係託於儒家尊古之教育以役世。今以新中學生入投機式之國醫學校。遑論其學理牽强附會。不合邏輯。不爲曾受數理化科目之青年所唾棄。即其學古之訓育。亦必與曾經新文學薰染之讀書方法格格不入。是不啻引慧童入魔術家之後台。而强令以點石成金號於衆也。其可得乎。國醫評論。舊醫後台之素描與劇評也。嘻。後生可畏。諸公休矣。龐京周識</p>
<p>中國醫藥事業，是新舊混淆，是非莫辨，一切荒唐怪誕的現象，幾乎隨處可以聽到。雖則是醫政不能統一的緣故，而民智的糼穉，亦爲重大原因之一。於是就産生了所謂革新中國醫藥的問題，而這問題的持論者，又可大别分爲二派。前者是復古的，後者是澈底革新的。在前者的一派，大都是一種自命爲知識階級的非科學者，以爲中國舊醫藥的歷史有數千年的悠久，其間當然有不同磨滅的價値。所以極力提倡保侟，並且有所謂［舊醫科學化］的口號。究其實，此派都是透心糊塗的玄學者，非科學者，是不明瞭世界進化的大勢以及科學發達的程度，所以有這種似是而非的言論發表。實在是錯誤的。後者大都是科學者，頭腦清楚而不被玄學鬼迷感的學者，此派可舉余岫雲先生爲代表。余先生於舊醫的學說，有充分的認識，所批評舊醫的地方，完全根據科學，實事求是，没有一句話是空中樓閣的。伹是他的言論，因爲要驚醒他們一班頭腦　預，　麥不辨的民衆的緣故，不免言詞過於激昻，但亦是舊醫們所賜給余先生的，作者絶對不承認。）而引起了舊醫們的反響甚至說余先生爲飯碗問題面爭。這種言論的荒謬，明白的人，當然可以一望而知是不根據學理的廢語，可以置之不理，然而一犬吠影，百犬吠聲，很能夠阻碍中國醫學事業前途的光明，不可以不辯。因爲非科學的舊醫舊藥存在一日。，中國整個的醫藥事業多一日障碍。所以我們中華民族的健康計，爲整個的中國醫藥事業的前途計，不得不把維護荒唐怪誕的舊醫藥的言論，盡力批評。假使有人以爲提倡科學醫是賣國：提倡舊醫是保存國粹的話，那末此人的腦子中毒已到了極深的時候了，在這種人，旣這樣糊塗，我們爲怎麽還要諄諄的勸告他呢？因爲他們和我們同是中國人民的一位，不得不大言以開他們的紛惑。雖然，能夠把許多國産物加以改良，未始不是一件佳事，但是這班倡言改進中國醫藥的湖塗學者，要想單靠幾本書籍上得來的知識去改進，他的結果我們可以大胆的說是［等於零。］不用科學做工具去改進，饒你有那樣天大的本領，是無補於實際的。作者於並世所謂科學化的舊醫改進家，不敢貿然贊同。因爲覺得他們的言論，成事不足，而敗事有餘：是麻醉青所思想的毒藥。所以不自量力，爲有志革新中國醫藥事業者，　獻一些意見，並希教正！</p>
<p>關於中國整個的中國醫藥事業。在這畸形的中國，應當分做新舊甬方面來講：新的方面，最顯而易見的是人才缺乏；才缺乏的害處，是新的力量（科學醫的力量）不能發展。舊的力量容易滋長，而且這是互爲因果。因爲新力量不能發展；所以舊力量便容易滋長。因爲舊力量滋長愈容易，新力量但愈不能發展。這種情形並不是作者向壁虚造出來的，凡是稍爲留心中國醫學狀况的人，大槪多能知道吧？（請參看龐京周著近十年來上海市醫藥鳥瞰一文，載申報醫藥週刋）新的方面，我們只要有决心，有力量，總能夠達到我們理想中的境界。可是舊的方面就不然，持論略一疏忽，便容易誤入歧途，使無數有爲的青年，徬徨猶豫而無所適從。因爲有這種原因，所謂革新舊醫學的問題，纔有給我們檢討的必要。</p>
<p>我們不要去做所謂改進舊醫藥的工作則已，假使要去做這工作，那末最低限度便須具傳下列的六個條件。否則是從然耗費了許多可貴的腦細胞，而不收絲毫效果的，非特没有效果，而且　有阻碍［整個的中國醫藥事業］發展的可能！</p>
<h3>（一）立塲</h3>
<p>假使有人問我：［我們要研究舊醫藥的好壞，應該站在那　立塲上，換言之即應該用那種態度去研究它的好壞［？那末我一定要這要回答他：［應該站在科學的立場上，用科學的手段去研究舊醫藥的好壞。］要曉得不站在科學的立場去研究舊醫藥，就要産生種種錯誤。朁如舊醫們所謂的［改進國醫藥，］他根本就把醫學分出地域的界限來了，於是假使有人說舊醫藥應該廢棄，他就要憤然的駡你［有愛國，不知道利用。中國有許多國産藥産，以及靠國産藥物面生活的許多醫生藥舖，呌他怎樣維持生計？譚次仲先生有時也不免有如此的言論發表，我爲中國前途一哭。］等等使人發笑的話。這就是立場錯所致。否則他們决不會說這種目光短淺的話。要是我們站在科學的立場上就不然了，這件事是合於科學的，而有益於現代的，那末方許它存在。否則是復古的，不合科學的，不管它是［古今中外］的法責，都要一脚踏倒它，不要使它殘留一點渣滓在人間。總之，合於科學則生，不合科學則死，假使發表非科學的，復古的言論者：不論是我們的嚴威的父親。或是親熟的朋友，尊敬的師長，我們都要根據科學去非難它，推翻它，所謂［吾愛吾師，吾亦愛眞理。］者是。同志呀！切莫忘了這一句話！因爲科學的宇宙裏只有眞僞，没有善惡的，而何况做學問是當仁不讓的呢？記好！</p>

<p>而全治者。其肺　之結核病灶。因結締織之增加。被其圍繞而成硬結。但其中心尙殘留幾許有生活力之結核菌。（結核菌之抵抗力如上集一九節所述乃極强者。）然此結核菌果生存至何時。從外部之診察。難以明瞭。此後雖久經歲月。若其身體之防禦力十分减少時。則其疾病難免復發。此　所謂肺病再發者是也。已無何等之症狀。而身體肥滿。以爲全治而十分安心。因不養生而身體遂於不知不覺間。又趨瘦弱。熱亦漸漸發生。前之肺部疾病。逐漸復發。或因突然咯血。或罹其他重病而肺病再發。此蓋肺病時代之養生雖良好。而恢復期後之養生不足故也。實可惋惜。是以以醫師之眼光。嚴格論之。曾一次罹肺結核者。其一生涯之久時間。决不能謂爲全治。結核菌悉數死滅而全治者。雖亦有之。但各人如此。則難以保證。換言之。恢復期以後之患者。其一生涯間。實爲一種所謂［潛伏結核者］。由此觀之。恢復期以後之養生法。實爲緊要。</p>
<p>（其二）雖未經過正式肺結核疾病之時期。不知何傳染結核。有結核菌潛伏於身體之某部。發生與眞正肺病稍異之種種症狀。往往毫不覺得患結核。此即所謂眞正之潛伏結核症。小兒期及少年期之身體簿弱者，殆均屬此狀態者也。後來大部分成爲眞正之肺結核。此等在普通醫師。用一般之診斷法。雖難以診斷。倘以專門家之目光觀之。多一見即可明瞭。俗所謂肺病候補者或肺病質之少年。殆悉屬於此。可由［土貝可林］皮虘反應試騐呈著明反應而知之。今從外表易知之症狀略言之。如身體瘦削。雖服多量之滋養物面不肥壯。顔色蒼白。無氣力。常因細小之事。而容易疲勞。且易起心悸亢進。易罹感冒。一罹感冒後。久而難治。容易發熱及咳嗽。時出盜汗。易起胸痛及胸内壓迫之感。胃腸弱而食慾缺乏。在婦人往往伴有月經閉止或月經困難。此在世人或一部分之醫師。對於此種潛伏結核患者。普通多目爲貧血，神經衰弱，胃腸病，婦人病。雖可施以相當之治療。而久不見效。蓋貧血病，神經衰弱，胃腸病，婦人病者。僅不過爲其外表。而根本實爲潛伏結核症。今不施以潛仗結核症之治療。其不能全治者。理所當然者也。（未完）</p>

<h3>轉變後</h3>
<p>— 歐碧</p>
<p>應該是轉變的時候了：你的意識這樣告訴你，你的環境也這樣强制你於是你轉變了，你丢棄了一切不應該歎息的歎息，不應該流淚的流淚。你已有一個新生。你已在做一個有意義的人，像喬治桑一樣。</p>
<p>現在你開始第一步的工作是精深地研究藝術，因爲藝術是人生的反映，是人間苦的結晶；待研究透了藝術，你便要勇敢地踏上險峻的人生大道，慷慨高歌地，視死如歸地，從滿目是荆棘，到處是豺狠的中間爲全人類殺出一條血路，以解入他們的苦難，並悲慘地完成你自已的悲劇的人生。</p>
<p>可是，第一步，你要研究你的反映人生的藝術。你要研究藝術，你便得到［南國］去，因爲，在［南國］，有你天才的憧憬，有你理想的幻夢。</p>
<p>自然，在你决定離開上海而到［南國］去的時候，你曾感到一種無名的惆悵的襲擊，因爲［海上］是你留變的，正如你留戀西湖一樣。西湖有温存的柔情，［海上］却有剛毅的鬥爭的活躍；西湖有山水的秀麗，［海上］却有機械的雄美；西湖有……［海上］有……。可是，［南國］呢？你將於這暫止的飄零中重走上你的飄零之路？［南國］將給你怎樣的一個印象？是給你光明呢，還是……？</p>
<p>於是你又有些躊躇了，又有些徬徨了。</p>
<p>可是在一轉念間，你又對你自已說：躊躇什麽？徬徨什麽？除了只有死外，還能有什麽别的？於是你便抱了死的决心似地趕快整理你的書籍，檢查你的衣服。</p>
<p>於是你像一個赴義的戰士般壯烈地向［南國］走去，去研究你的解入人類的苦難，並完成你自已的悲劇的人生的藝術。</p>
<h3>［感舊］以後</h3>
<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>還要寫一點。但得聲明在先，這是由施蟄存先生的話所引起，却並非爲他而作的。對于個春，我原稿上常是舉出名字來，然而一到印出，却往往化爲［某］字，或者是一切闊人姓名，危險字樣，生殖機關的俗語的共同符號［ＸＸ］了。我希望這一篇中的有幾個字，没有這樣變化，以免誤解。</p>
<p>我現在要說的是：說話難，不說亦不易。弄筆的人們，總要寫文章，一寫文章，就難免惹災禍，黃河的水向薄弱的堤上攻，于是露臂膊的女人和寫錯字的青年，就成了嘲笑的對象了，他們也眞是無拳無勇，只好忍受，恰如鄉下人到上海租界，除了拚出被稱爲［阿木林］之外，没有辦法一樣。</p>
<p>然而有些是寃枉的，隨手舉一個例，就有登在［論語］二十六期上的劉半農先生［自註自批］的［桐花芝豆堂詩集］這打油詩。北京大學招考，他是閱卷官，從國文卷子上發見一個可笑的錯字，就做詩，那些人被控苦得眞是要鑽地洞，那些剛畢業的中學生。自然，他是教授，凡所指摘，都不至于不對的，不過我以爲有些却還可有磋商的餘地。集中有一個［自註］道｛</p>
<p>［有寫［倡明文化］者，余曰：倡即［娼］字，凡文化發達之處，娼妓必多，謂文化由娼妓而明，亦言之成理也。］娼妓的娼，我們現在是不寫作［倡］的，但先前兩字通用，大約劉先生引據的是古書。不過要引古書，我記得［詩經］裏有一句［倡予和女］，好像還没有解作［自已也做了婊子來應和别人］的意思。所以那一個錯字，錯而已矣，可笑可鄙却不屬于他的。還有一名是｛</p>
<p>［幸［萌科學思想之芽］］，</p>
<p>［萌］字和芽］字旁邊都加着一個夾圈，大約是指明着可笑之處在這里的罷，但我以爲［萌芽］，［萌蘖］，固然是一名詞，［萌動］，［萌發］，就成了動詞，</p>
<p>五四運動時候，提倡［劉先生或者會解作［提起婊子］來的罷）白話的人們，寫幾個錯字，用錯幾個古典，是不以爲奇的，但因爲有些反對者說提倡白話者都是不知古書，信口胡說的人，所以往往也做幾句古文，以塞他們的嘴。但自然，因爲從舊壘中來，積習太深，一時不能擺脫，因此帶着古文氣息的作者，也不能說是没有的。</p>
<p>當時的白話運動是勝利了，有些戰士，還因此爬了上去，但也因爲爬了上去，就不但不再爲白话戰鬭，並且將　踏在脚下，拿出古字來嘲笑後進的青年了。因爲還正在用古書古字來笑人，有些青年便又以看古書爲必不可省的工夫，以常用文言的作者爲應該模仿的格式，不再從新的道路上去企圖發展，打出新的局面來。</p>
<p>現在有兩個人在這里：一個是學生，文中寫［留學生］爲［流學生］，錯了一個字；一個是大學教授，就得意洋洋的做了一首詩，曰，［先生犯了彌天罪，罰往西天把學流，應是九流加一等，麵筋熬盡一鍋油。］我們看罷，可笑是在那一面呢？</p>
<h3>秋陰蕞記　二　紹興酒價</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>中國筆記中，記唐時酒價怕，每以三百青銅錢，或美酒斗十千等詩句爲解答，實在不可靠得很，亦猶答黃河水源之以［天上來］三字了局，是一個樣子。現在中國流行最廣，而色香味並佳的酒，總之是紹興酒了，而這紹興酒的價錢，也眞奇怪，每家每處，都是不同的。紹興城裏如何，我不曉得，即以北平天津漢口南京廣州上海等處來說，因地方的不同，而酒價有别，倒還可以說得，甚至在同一地方於同一酒名之下，價錢還時有上落，這眞是怪事了。當然酒的質地和分量的如何，更是另外一個問題。據我的經騐說來，杭州的紹興酒，的確要比别處便宜，這是質地分量上來說的話，至如有幾家酒店，掛起幾十年陳的一塊招牌，動不動就是幾元一斤，那却是欺人之談了。前幾日因爲落雨，曾在岳墓的大醉過一塲，順口唱來，唱出了［十日秋陰水拍天，湖山雖好未容顚，但憑極賤杭州酒，爛醉西泠岳墓前］的二十八字，也是實寫。紹興酒以東浦，阮社兩地的産品爲佳，其餘的地方。雖也有作坊，但味道總差一點，大約是水的關係。</p>
<h3>澉浦通信（五）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>○○兄··</p>
<p>這兩天，我們一直生活在鹽田衰和鹽　　，我們知道了許多關於製鹽的事。從來生活在都會　的我們，一旦走進了這鹽區，眞彷彿跑入了另外的一個世界，一切都是陌生，一切都是新　　　　　　］　［新　］之中，我們是逐漸的了解　　的産生的艱難，和在　　之鄕　，曾經發生過的不少値得我們注意的事，有人與大自然的爭鬥，有人與豪紳的肉搏，如終古的海浪一般，這些事，是不斷發生着，在過往以及在現在。</p>
<p>按着順序，我們就先說一說鹽的生産過程吧。鹽和米一樣，是有着田的，一般的稱做［鹽田］；所謂［鹽出］，實際上就是濱　生長着的海灘。把這些純沙泥的淮灘，依它的橫度區分，就成爲一畝一畝的田；所以然以橫而不以直的原故，是因爲直度不時的向海中生長，不能有任何的樣則。屬於每一家或者每畝的鹽田，鹽民們常常在分界處植上一行青草，大約這就算是界碑了。這樣的鹽田，當你驅車過了乍浦的時候，沿着海岸，是一直伸張下去：當你看到茫茫的一片海塘，在塘上有一個一個突起的土堆，遠看如　塚一樣，你記着，這就是你每天吃的鹽的故鄉了。這種田，當海潮來的時候，是全部没在水中的，而這也就是雄偉的海，把鹽種植在鹽民田裏的時候。潮退了，這兒留給鹽民的，是一塊塊的濕瀘瀘的田，鹽民對於這是感到歡喜。但鹽並不就這樣成功，潮來過了，按着鹽民要把他的希望期諸天，他們渴望着强烈的日光的來監。一天一天輼續的晒，總要連續晒四五天的光景，鹽田纔能完全的被晒成白色，這白色就是所謂鹽了。然而一定是要繼續四五天的晒，如果晒到第三天或者第四天，天上來一陣雨，而這雨到了屋簷已滴水的大，那麽這一回的晒是浪費的，鹽民們除了懊喪之外，祇有再繼續的等幾天，因爲晒到土面的鹽，是又被雨打進土裏去了。就是晒了四五天，大家已經削了灰，翻了土，若果天上再來一次雨，這翻土削灰的工夫，一樣是無代價的。所以，一連要六七個太陽，一回鹽是繼能收到的：可是，手續並不這樣就完。</p>
<p>關於［削灰］，我們還得說詳細一點。這其間，一樣是有許多過程的。當太陽把鹽已經完全晒到土面來了，鹽民們便相約的去削。他們和在米田裏工作着的人們一樣，帶着許多削灰的工具，和烟茶之類的東西，到鹽田裏開始工作。他們的第一道手續是［削灰］，所謂［削灰］，是用［削刀］把浮面的一層土刮起來的意思。［削刀］是一個約四五尺長的長方木框，三面是木，下面的一頭是約一尺五寸長的切刀。鹽民把這套在頭上，用兩手按住兩邊，切刀　人土内，一步一步的·一行一行的·很吃力的向後拖，使浮面約土在刀鋒下翻過身來，這是含有鹽汁最多的泥土。翻起以後，再給太陽晒一天半天，就進行下一步的［倒灰］的工作·［倒灰］，這個意思是很容易明白的，就是用　把這削起的泥土向鹽池衷倒的意思。說到［倒灰］，我却不能不便帶的，也可以說强調的，說一說在鹽場衷的婦女。在鹽場衷，一般的說，多的是婦女的工作者，她們很努力，不時比男子的成績來得更優秀，她們在製鹽的造程中，没有一方面的工作不做，［一倒灰］也大都由她們動手。她們對於這一方面的工作，和男性一樣的嫻熟，可以很快的把灰倒到籮内，而且挑到鹽池邊的時候，不須要一籮一籮的，或得放下擔子來倒。她們仍舊是直着身子，把灰擔挑在肩上，祇是拉着兩頭的繩子一傾，兩籮的灰便全部的落入池中。這樣的傾倒方式，是我們慣常看見的，但决不是一件容易的事，所以，我在這裏特殊的提起。　　這浮面一層的泥土的灰，是倒進了鹽池了，但這樣手續也還没有完，以下接着的，還有［，挑水］［製滷］等等的步驟。爲着　幅的關係，</p>
<p>在這封信裏我不能繼續下去，祇有留待明天了。不過，就是依據這已涉及的過程看，鹽的製成的不简單，艱難，已可以看見了，而况這裏所述的，還只是鹽的本身的事，只是生産過程的二分之一。古詩詠米，說米是［粒泣皆辛苦］，假若你了解鹽的製造過程，鹽又何當不是粒粒由血汗得來呢？</p>

<p>一個淡黃色的臉顯出來了，他記得那健康的　，是早民消去；　紋在一條半條地增加着。他用手捧了自已的下頦，那雙手，有着蒼青色的筋是更突起來的，詫異是可以不必有，而心中的感嘆，却自自然然地生着了。</p>

<p>他更有力地搖着頭，他像是希望着讓他一個人坐在這裏，没有一點聲響，於是那年青的記憶就可以慢慢地爬過來。那年老的僕人懂得所有的事，就提輕了脚步又退出去。</p>
<p>把手隨意地插到睡衣的袋子裏，指尖碰到了點子紙，立刻他就想起來。</p>
<p>［人眞是不中用了，怎麽一點也記不起來了呢］？他喃喃地念着。</p>

<p>雖然是已經知道了那裏面告訴他的是些什麽事，却仍然又打開來看着，看着她那字跡，在十五年前就爲友人說着相像的，這還是没有改變。他能想得到她寫字來該有佂麽樣子的姿態，是不是她的嘴角要有一點牽動？而且他也想得起來第一次在他的眼前提起筆來，她是如何地自已用一隻手掩了，有着天眞的含羞。而在那張紙上寫着：在ＸＸ日，等等我吧］。</p>
<p>是爲一種歡快所襲擊麽，他的手在微微地抖着，眼睛又有點模糊起來，他用手抺着，臉上就塗匀了淚。</p>

<h3>食糧問題與捐稅</h3>
<p>— 鈞達</p>
<p>中國年來農業减收，米的生産也同時衰落，那是很明顯的現象。不過，米産的衰落與食糧的恐慌，一般人都併爲是一件事情，卽由於米産的不足，以致引起食糧　慌，這實是庸俗的　論。第一；中國食糧缺乏的現象，表現於洋米的進口，但洋米的進口不過是近三四十年來的事情，在以前除了特别的年份如荒年外，中國並没有感到米的缺乏，也不需洋米接濟。所以中國米的［自然生産力。］並没有落在米的需要量之後，那是一定的。第二，卽使說，中國米的［自然生産力］頗大，而實際生産量在近年是减少了，如稻田的改植鴉片，及棉花等原料作物，以及人禍天災的影響收穫，那也是事實。但是，在同時，隨着米的生産量的减少，中國人民食米的成份更在减少。不但是北部數省的農民食米者將絶跡，就是以米爲主要食糧的中部及南部農民，其主要的食糧，亦逐漸的是由甘器等低劣農産的排斥了米的食用。所以，今日中國由米的供給量缺乏而形成的食糧恐慌，與食糧生産量的衰落，是截然兩件事，否則，何以去年和今日米的豐收，不但不能解决食糧恐慌問題，而且反而加甚了食糧恐慌的程度，促進一般農民餓着肚子，非爲盜賊，卽爲餓莩，而去搶米呢？</p>
<p>所以，促進米産衰落的是一件事，形成食糧恐慌的又是一件事。有的時候，不但不是米産衰落引起食糧恐慌，而還是因食糧恐慌而促進米産衰落，如［豐收成災］的現象，卽是這種事實表現的一端。這是中國現社會關係下的一個特徵。</p>
<p>促進食糧恐慌的原因很複雜，而以前及現在作爲國民革命的對象之一，天天喊着要限銷而始終不能取銷的［苛捐雜稅］卽是其中最主要的一端，简單的可由下面這樣幾點來說明：</p>
<p>第一，中國今日米的最大消費市塲，顯然的不是農村而是都市，農民經濟的窮乏促使農民種稻者没有米吃，種麥者没有麵吃。米的生産亦不是遍於全國，而僅限於數省，於是産銷的調節，逐成爲食糧問題中的重要一部。而苛捐雜稅的存在，卽阻礙了　個重要的工作。各省的禁米出境且不說，而重蘆的捐稅，已足阻止米的流通，使米在生産區域的農村不能連銷到消費區域的都市中。舉例明之，如每擔米的捐稅，在湖南是護照費一元，水脚一元二角，蔴袋四角，出口關稅三角二分，升合二角，湖南行佣二角，水險駁費報關費二角，上海火險行佣二角，計洋三元三角二分。在江西是護照費一元，水脚每百斤四錢，每包約八角五分，蔴袋四角，出口關稅三角三分，升合三角，江西行佣二角，水險駁費報關費二角，上海行佣火險雜費二角，計洋三元一角七分。在安徽蕪湖，是護照費四角，水脚每百斤三錢，每包約六角五分，蔴袋四角，出口稅三角，升合五角，匯水每千兩五兩，雜費用三角，水險駁費報關費每石二角，每包共計洋約三元，（見中國經濟創刋號頁三三）。他如天府之國的四川，稅捐的重蠱，常使禾朽田中，所以如江蘇調查所得，米在原産地與都市的價格，相差常在六七倍間，（見江蘇省實業誌末章）。這樣，不但農民把米出售無利可圖，甚且虧本，就是米販米商，也往往　足不前。如本年七月二十六日大公報載：［。晋省糧食，向有餘裕，運銷河北，自去　大告豐收以來，不但各縣囤積過剩，形成穀賤傷農之慘象，卽以太原而論，今春糧商以米糧跌價滯銷，賠累至鉅，加以金融蔽塞，告貨無門，綠此相繼倒閉者已不下十餘家，而河北　鹿石莊，南至順德邯鄲，北至保定一帶，近據調查，米價之昂，幾與麥等，其缺乏米豆雜糧可想而知，是晋冀近在隣封，相隔一山，一方以生産過剩；囤積死滯，一方供不敷需，糧價高貴］。其所以如此滯　不通者，除了變相捐稅的國有鐵路運債之高外，直接的打擊也仍然是捐稅的苛重。</p>
<p>第二，食糧恐慌的另一面是産米區域的米價過低，所謂穀賤傷農：其原因正和米在消費市場因捐稅苛重而價格過昂一樣，也仍然是由於捐稅的過重。捐稅的苛重，一方面使米價過高，别方面又使米價下落，這並不矛盾，而是事之必然。因爲農民負擔奇重，以致不得不借債，或糧食預賣，或因急於繳納捐稅，而你收穫的米急於出售，這樣必然使米價跌落至最低的限度，卽形成食糧恐慌的另一面。</p>
<p>各地農民所負擔的捐稅之苛重，有時竟使人難於置信。如［黃河百病，祇富一套。］的河套各鄕，農民負擔稅捐之苛重，竟至終年勤勞所穫，不數賦稅的繳納，農民不得不逃亡，而使荒地日加，（二二，六，一五，大公報。）江蘇省鎭江淮安一帶，所有的附加稅總額超過正賦的十倍，每興一事，卽多一種附加，事務有更替，而附加則永遠存在，（二二，五，二八，大公報。）寗遠農民的負擔，使中産的農家，也不勝維持，（二二，八，二，同上。）晋縣向稱富庶之區，年來機關林立，負擔日重，農民經濟大起恐慌，終歲所得，除一切稅捐差徭外，所餘無幾，民衆困苦，達於極點，（二二，七，二○，同上。）邵陽苛稅，更爲駭人聽聞，田賦正銀一兩，須納洋十四元餘，（二二，九，六，同上。）保定田稅捐苛重，而引起的農民貧乏，竟至使商人不敢投標承包，（二二，七，一一。）江蘇省江北各縣，［商販裏足，凡百事業益形凋數，而淮漣·泗·沭·宿·睢·等各縣，縣屬機關添加經費，均取給於農，農民窮於應付］（二二，一○，四，大晚報。）不得已，在僱租收稅員來時，祇有把僅存以維持一家生命的食糧，廉價出售。如去年［陜西農民收糧一石，市價不過三四元，而由此一石之糧，須納捐稅達八九元，捐欵超過生産價格一倍，農民爲要繳捐欵，不得不縮下食米，只好吃粥，節省出來的小麥，大米，都挪到城市上去賣，所以市面上的食糧很多，没有去路，價錢便更加賤了。（二一，一○，一六，西安日報。）有的爲了要納稅，往往在稻未收穫時，卽預賣去，（見中國農村經濟資料第三章第一章，黎明書局。）甚且到收穫時，還不足付已預賣出之貨，再如四川省稅捐無定時，祇要有一次戰爭，卽被勒索一次，今日田賦已被預徵到民國八十五年，（二二，七，三，時事新報。）農民在這種突如其來的勒索光臨時，自然祇有［不論價的］出售其糧食以換現金了。</p>
<p>第三，食糧恐慌的又一面，卽使是米的生産是衰落，則其重大原因之一，捐稅也有密切的關係。米的生産成本比大豆甘薯等高許多，捐稅使農民普遍的窮乏，結果是無力從事於米的生産。據上海市四鄕農本調查的報告，種稻的利益比種黃豆等高上許多，而種稻的大部是自耕農，佃農多是種黃豆的，種稻的很少，（中國農村經濟資料第二章。）浙江省各縣甘薯的種植面積，已佔到第三位，而且逐漸的在擴大開來，這並没有其他的原因，只不過因甘薯種植的成本至廉，於此可知農家經濟情形與農産種植的關係。稅捐促進農民種稻等食糧不能維持生存，逐不得不改種利益較高的植物，鴉片　其主要的一種。如四川的「懶捐，」，简直是勒逼農民非種鴉片不可。</p>
<p>第四，因捐稅苛重所引起的農家經濟的貧乏，一方面招致米的生産量减少，同時他方面又引起消費量的縮减。農民不食米，已成爲一般的現象。北數省且不論，就是本以米爲主要食糧的中部及南部數省，農民食糧的由優趨劣的傾向，也至爲明顯。如湖北省的岳州，輪出的農産物中，以穀爲大宗，而農民食米的極少，主要的食糧，是甘薯，　豆，間或混入少許的米以作食。（湖北貨藥雜誌第一○四號）再如馬相亞爾所說；廣東有大都份的地方，甘薯已佔了農民食糧的第二位。在浙江，大多數的農民均以甘薯替代了米，（見中國農村經濟研究。）旣然，因捐稅的苛重，米由原産地，運往消費市場不易，而同時又以農家的窮乏，而米原産地的農民很少食米，是米必然的在原産地屯積起來，而形成食糧恐慌的又一面，｛食糧的過剩。</p>
<p>所以，不論直接或間接，苛捐雜稅的存在，是中國食糧問題解决的阻碍，那是毫無疑問的，稅捐問題不解决，洋米徵稅也枉然。然而，今日中國不論是中央政府或地方政府，卽使有現存的這些捐稅的收入，尚感到財政的困難，是則阻碍糧食問題解决的一切苛捐雜稅的取銷，又是談何易易？</p>
<h3>倉儲制度之檢討</h3>
<p>— 何冰</p>
<p>最近當局電令贛湘等八省政府，各派代表集議糧食問題的電文中，列舉救濟農村三項根本方針，第二三兩項爲倉儲問題：「…（二）辦理積穀，恢復地方倉廳舊制，去歲武昌總部，迭曾　令分函各省催辦本　，應卽查照切實辦理，務求實効，（三）擬請中央就棉麥借欵項下，在各　省創建新式之倉庫，辦理積極存儲，押借欵項，及通　運銷事，以調節民食，提高糧價，流通農村金融，將來週轉資金，……」這二種方針，作用是一樣的，而性質則是不同的。本盲人摸象之愚，就個人所知，略論如次：</p>
<p>第一，切社會現象都有其各方面密切的關聯與一定的基礎，隨時代而不同，這一時代適用的方法，未必適用於那一個時代。新朝努力於恢復春秋以前的所請「井田」制度，已不可能，以後歷代復古運動，無論是怎樣努力，都是枉然，在今日而欲恢復以前的舊式倉儲，情形正復相同。</p>
<p>以前的倉儲，如社倉，義倉等，都是以農民自動積儲食糧爲主，其惟一的基礎，是建於「地方自足經濟」上面，當時商品交換勢力不大，不但一縣農産比較可自給，而每家農民也多能自給，他們自已食用自已生産的農産，如有餘裕，自然可以積儲起來，以防荒年，不論以村，以族，以鄕，爲單位，祇要在同一的經濟體中，卽可創立倉儲。</p>
<p>但是現在的情形已截然不同。自從資本主義侵入以後，商品的狂流，早已把以家，以村，甚至以縣，以省，爲單位的地方自足經濟，完全打破，地方經濟旣破壞，建立於地方經濟之上的倉儲制度，自然隨之崩潰。</p>
<p>根據現在所有農村調查報告，可以很明顯的看出中國各地的農家經濟均已完全的商品化。他們不但衣着等用品必須從市塲上購買，就是平時的食糧，也多從市場上購來。他方面，爲了一切的需要，他們在秋收之後，大部都把收穫的食糧出售，很少儲藏起來備作自用，他們往往今日把自已的食糧廉價售出，到明日，又出高價買回他們自已的食糧。這並不是矛盾的，因資本主義侵入後，農民十家有九家負債，他們爲應付高利貸，地租，賦稅等支出，惟有急不及待的把農産廉價售出，但在飢寒交迫中，却又不能不任商業高利貸者的剝削，而忍痛或借或買，得到一些食糧以維持生存。以前農民的農産自給而有餘，可以成立倉儲以防饑，現在農民呻吟於商品漩渦中，飢寒無告，在這樣的轉變下，倉儲制度自必隨之破壞無餘。</p>
<p>除農民自動的積儲以外，以前還有以公團爲主體的地方公倉，主要的如以一族一姓爲單位的社倉。但到現在，各地名爲公産的「公田」，都是壟斷於少許私人之手，而且，近年來公田加入賣買的過程激驟，多已陸續落入私人之手。在公産公田消滅之後，所謂以公團爲主體的公倉，自也無從再建。</p>
<p>所以，第一種舊式的倉儲，在今日不但必然的破壞，而且還很難於恢復。</p>
<p>第二，再就第二種新式的倉儲而言，如電文中所述，其性質又可分爲二點，第一是以政储的財政支出，來收賞食糧，成立倉儲，第二點是以此種倉儲來　營糧食押欵，調節金融。</p>
<p>一現然之下，這罹新式倉儲的根本作用如何且不論，就第一點的性質而言，年來政府財政已羅掘無遺，在那一部份中支撥出些錢來，似萬不可能，如云因辦倉儲而加徵附稅，那是農民利未見而害已來，非我們所希望。不過現在說是由棉麥借欵中支撥一部份，情形似有不同。棉麥情欵的全部爲數固不能說少，而較之中國今日各方面的需要，實在　是杯水車薪。此事之能否卽成事實，與所支撥的一部份能否足夠舉辦這祝之雖小而實巨大的工作，那惟有待諸將來事實的證明。</p>
<p>就第二點來說，那是很普通的，江蘇農民銀行及上海新華銀行等在無錢武進等縣，是已舉辦過這種工作。但其成效如何呢？</p>
<p>「十九年冬，農民銀行在禮社（無錫）經營押米借欵，每白米一石，　借七元，月利一分，保險費一厘，存棧費二厘，手續費三厘，合共一分六厘。至次年六月底截止，無力贖取者，將押米變賣抵償本息，餘欵發還。農民及中小　主逼於急　，負米而來者，絡釋於途，放欵達一萬八千餘元。去年因水災大荒，全鎭稻田全準淹没，無顆粒收穫者十居八九，然農民銀行及新華銀行經營之押米放欵，幾及二萬元；地主所收租米及鄒近農民之全部收穫，典質殆盡。」（余霖君調查，中國農材經濟資料，四一三頁。）</p>
<p>這便是說，在整個的農村經濟崩潰無法解决的情形下，這種機關，亦惟有和今日陜西各縣及廣東揭陽等各地的典當一樣，有貸滿無人贖，被逼開門的危險。是則倉儲問題的枝節的建設，仍未能謂爲根本原救治方針。</p>
<h3>洋米徵稅問題的中心　徵稅是否有利於農村</h3>
<p>— 良明</p>
<p>據十月八日報載；注米入口征稅，經立法院財政委員會審查，根據國家財政及國民經濟之立場，决定征收，稅則最高率爲二·五○，最低率免稅。至於詳細稅率，則由財政部依此旣定原則，自行擬定云云。觀此，則自去年民食會議延擱至今，消息頻傳的洋米徵稅問題，日漸具體化，開征似亦爲期不遠了。且洋米進口數量最多的廣東方面，早經實行，雖有米商一再反對，而粵政府堅决表示，不能收回成命的了。關於近月來，洋米徵稅問題之討讑亦云夥矣。徵稅的理由，不外是因本米價跌，徵稅卽所以救濟農民，也可說是半年來「復興農村」所呼喊出來的第一件切實的成績。然而一般論者，對於問題的中心，徵稅是否有利於農村這一點，很少充分的說明。</p>
<p>第一，我們必須先爲明瞭今日米之供求實况：稍明中國農村經濟槪况者，誰都知道今日中國佔人口總數百分之八十以上的農民，大部份所喫的食糧，是玉蜀黍·小米·甘薯·南瓜·甚目上野菜等最低劣的食料。用以充飢。食米的除地主以外，　粥麥飯，不過是絶小部份農民罷了。所以米的消費量最廣的，是幾個大都市及一部份的市鎭。都市中人口的構成，以産業勞動者及小職工爲最多。米倒是占他們生活費中最重要部分，所以米價的貴賤，與這些人的生計大有關係。往年上海歷次的工潮中，有一部份便是爲米價貴，勞動者要求增加「米貼」而起的。因此米的消費市塲旣以大都市爲主，而中國産米區域又不是　於各省，於是米的運輪調節成爲最重要的工作。固然，洋米的競爭傾銷爲本米不能立足之一端，然不能否認的，各省捐稅之征歛，運費之高昂，復加以禁止出境等阻碍，常使米囤積於原産地，形成過剩，就在一省之内，亦有時各縣之間，彼疆此界，不相往來，其他可知了。</p>
<p>不特如此，中國現行的是普遍的小農制度，農民各家所産米的數量有限，並不能直接達於消費者之手，必須經過米販糧行等中間商人，始能出賣，而一般農民之出賣米穀，大槪又不出乎下列三種形式：（一）在示收割甚且未下種時預賣，（二）在未收割甚且未下種時因借債及惜糧等而抵押，（三）收割剛完，卽因急於要償付租繳稅等，而急將所收獲的米出售。由這三種形式而出售於米販糧行或抵押於押當的，農民絶對没有自然選擇其賣價的可能，惟有一任對方的决定。然除此三種形式的出賣以外，其他的方法絶無僅有。我們常念「二月賣新絲，五月　新穀，醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉。」不意亦爲現代的農村寫照。</p>
<p>第二，洋米徵稅的結果，是進口的洋米，旣然是消費於都市中的，洋米進口稅如實行，則米價必漲。廣州省政府在洋米徵稅的消息傳出後，雖尙未實行，而米價卽漲，可爲證明。米價如漲；此外又無補充調劑的辦法，則米價必再漲，到此地步，都市中食米的産業勞動者與一部份小職工，卽非大受打擊不可。今日正當産業不景氣最嚴重的時候，各工廠自然没有力量增加工人及職工的工資；一般所能勉維生存，爲的是米價賤，百物亦賤，假使米價一高，不但不能阻擋洋米之輪入，而靠薪工收入的職工，要大起恐慌了。</p>
<p>在農民方面說，農民食米的雖不多，價格的騰貴，在消費上說，影響自無都市裏的大，但並不是說没有人食米的，自資本主義侵入後，中國農産物商品化的程席殊甚，食米的農民很多不是食其自産的米，往往把自已所産的米出賣，而又買入市上的米。這是今日中國農村中很普遍的現象，在各種農村調查中均可證明。這樣，始米價貴了後，食米的農民也必受重大的打擊。如說食米的農民，以富農入自耕農爲多，則米價的騰貴卽將促使富農及掁耕農没落，使農村經濟更趨於崩潰。</p>
<p>洋米徵稅目的之最重要的一點，是提高本米的價格，增加農民的收入。這固不論近來農民非全種稻，就是種稻的農民，能受其惠的亦少。洋米徵稅後，本米的價格或許能提高起來，但這種提高，主要的是米商出售給消費者的價格的提高，並不是生産者的農民出售給米商的價格的提高。因爲祇要租佃制，商業高利貸，資本苛捐雜稅等的存在，農民是没有不貧乏的，農民因爲貧乏，於是不能不把米由一述三種形式出售的。在這三種的出售形式中，與其說是賣買，無寗說是剝奪，這米價提高的利益，依然是不歸農民的了，這點是很重要的。</p>
<p>所以，綜合起來，洋米徵稅，在現狀之下，說是救濟農村，似乎没有多大作用。而且如廣東省政府徵收洋米稅，說是用於救濟農村。但據本年九月大晚報廣州通訊中所說，爲是粵省每年洋米入口，値港幣六七千萬，以値十抽一計之，計入亦可得國幣八九百萬之間，而現在粵中財政因難，所闕亦僅此而止，一舉措間，卽可解决財政困難，宜科其毅然出之云云。徵稅之用意所在可見。</p>
<p>一般形式論者，以爲「是」「非」可取决於事實的二極端之間，實際上並没有這樣的簡單。洋米的傾銷，如不加取締，中國本米永無發展之時，中國農村經濟亦惟有日趨於崩潰。然如在穯造成米産衰落與食糧恐慌的諸内在的原因不剷除，産銷没有統一的辦法的時候，洋米徵稅的作用，不過是增加人民的一種負担而已！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>說騎牆</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>這裏讓我先來引徵一件右實，便是和騎牆類似的蝙蝠那東西，相傳有這麽一則故事：地上的走獸在集會，蝙蝠去參加，問牠的資格，牠說牠能在地上走，好像一隻老鼠；空中的飛禽在集會，蝙蝠也去參加，問牠的資格，牠說牠能在空中飛，好像一隻麻雀。這麽一來，小小的蝙蝠，也能走，也能飛，居然像兩棲的蛙一樣，在水裏是水族，爬上岸便是大陸的生物。這樣，生活的領域就格外擴展了，享受也自然來得豐足與永恒，就是說牠的生命似乎要比一般的充實與長壽。</p>
<p>騎牆就是這麽一套勾當兒，右脚踏在這方，左脚踏在那方，兩方都踏着，兩方都討好。這裏是分明的指點着人類的一種生活藝術，不，簡直是一種特擅的人生哲學，因爲與蝙蝠這東西相彷彿，所以最適宜拿牠來做對比。</p>
<p>講到騎牆，眞是旣費詞，而又題旨難賅，只得來一番摘要式的阐述，他的維妙維美的地方究竟在那裏？究竟怎樣？那就請看：</p>
<p>比方你的左鄰與右舍，是一對鬥角勾心累世敵愾的寃家，你居間其中，處當固難，也就是你試用騎牆的好塲合，左鄰向你訴述右舍的壞處，你同情着，而且點着頭，他若進一步要你帮忙去縱右舍的火，你除了應顧及到火起了你將怎樣去拆斷自已的屋簷以外，也無妨力助一臂。反過來，右舍向你告發左鄰的陰謀毒計，這時你不僅僅是同情和點頭了事，最好這要仗義立言，抒發一塲大議論，說左鄰是如何的卑汚狠毒，他若打算向官廳去上訴，你的文墨分明是括括呌的，毋妨熱心點像毛遂式的把撰狀的工作延攬過來，不過你須愼重些，最好登在三層擱裏寫，把四面的門縫窗隙，都用紙緊緊的紥封，唯恐消息牙溢，給左鄰知道了，有些放不下面子。</p>
<p>這麽一來，你就會雙方討好，利益並進：東鄰會請你喝酒吃飯，過年送節，右舍也會以他的兒子拜你做乾爸爸。說得寬一點，你若到了尶𡯓的時候，借�</p>

<p>再比方說，到社會上去，也儘可使用這一套，想在政界活動活動，做做官，最好對Ｘ先生也好，對Ｘ先生也好，對西南也好，對西北也好。這樣對方自然也會投報你以好，也就不難官運亨通，無往不判，應顧不暇。即使難以在某方高居要衝，獨斷一面，也儘可私地卜居，這方支乾薪，那方領津貼，出門更會到這兒有這兒的旅費撥發，到那兒……</p>
<p>就講到文人，也頗可使用騎牆拿手，要能新能舊，能激烈，能落伍，這兒的會社是那派人幹，你就開放那派人的意識，那兒的又得掉用一套。如果爲副刋雜志的文章，就要老八股，新八股樣樣上得手，拿得出，投其所也，於是你</p>

<h3>文憑與出路</h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>文憑這東西，據說是證明學歷，資格，程度的一張紙頭。因此，假使你要證明自已是什麽大學，專校，或中學的畢業生，你祇須將那寳貝｛文憑｛拖出來，請了說　就　　　亦因爲這個緣故　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　火的代價，去「買」或「僞造」這寳貝了。</p>
<p>可是按之實際，這話有幾他眞實呢？事實上，在現今的社會裏，没月文憑的，倒都豐衣足食逍遙自在，但是反之，有文憑的，却有連褲子亦没有穿的。</p>
<p>據前幾日報載，有大學畢業生馮某，因僞造文憑詐財，被人窺破，帶入捕房收押云。按馮某旣然是大學畢業生，那麽總不會没有文憑的吧！然而文憑對他有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>在上海馬路上，我們亦時常能夠看見，鋪着堂堂底文憑告地狀的。總之，這種「文憑無能」的事實，是數見不鮮的，馮某的一椿，不過是其中的一例吧了！</p>
<p>但是，反過來，那些事盡人生的幸福的人們，不見得個個都有文憑的吧！甚至，有幾個在一生中，從不曾見過那寳貝的！</p>
<p>因此，在目今這畸形的社會裏，你如只有文憑一張，而想找出路的，那不過是你的夢想吧了｛但，你假使没有文憑，而有特殊的背景，以及裙帶關係的，那麽你的出路是很有希望的。除了特殊的背景和關係外更有文憑的話，那可再好没有了。</p>
<p>總括地說，文憑和出路是各不相關的。在没有某種居間物以前，文憑永遠不會發生任何效力，同時亦没有什麽出路可言。亦就是說，在特種形勢下，文憑和出路纔有聯絡的可能。並且，這矛盾的社會在一天，這種事實亦將隨着繼續下去。</p>

<h3>午餐</h3>
<p>— 際雲</p>
<p>上海人的一頓早餐。除了闊人們的家裏。有廚子烹煑狠講究的點心外。大家總是是媽媽虎虎的。稀飯，蟹壳黃，生煎饅頭，粢飯，大餅油條，是最普通的美品。寄生蟲式的公館裏的老爺太太們。顚倒日夜地聽說書。抽大烟。等到日出三竿。方始就寢。他們祇有白木耳，蓮心湯，桂花白糖粥，猪油夾沙八寳飯等等細膩東西。做宵夜品。根本上没有什麽早餐的。狠有許多經濟同志。在早晨盥洗之後。喝一杯白開水點點心。橫堅離開午餐不遠。把褲帶束束緊算了。</p>
<p>至於晚餐呢。闊人們彼此有酬酢。舞塲，酒樓，總會，堂子，形形色色。不勝枚舉。普通人總是在自已家裏。吃一頓家常便飯。</p>
<p>唯有一頓午餐。介於早晚之間。對於營養身體上。最爲重要。日間有工作的。吃午餐的花樣最多。起碼有十等階級。然而他們的結果。都是裝飽肚子而已。同樣的變成米田共。也是同樣的可以益壽延年。</p>
<p>（一）三倒冷飯　不省一文</p>
<p>（二）黃包車夫　陽春加三　銅元十五枚</p>
<p>（三）出店西崽　粢飯油荳腐線粉湯　銅元</p>
<p>二十枚</p>
<p>(四)洋行小職員　牛油麫包或牛肉麫　小洋一角</p>
<p>（五）洋行中職員　沈萬興或五芳壽的客飯小洋二角二分</p>
<p>（六）高級職員　青年會或大中華的客飯小洋八角</p>
<p>（十）起碼洋人　鄧脫摩或海軍青年會的大菜　大洋一元二角</p>
<p>（八）小經理　上海及花旗總會的客菜　大洋五元</p>
<p>（九）大班　禮查及匯中飯店的客菜　大洋十元</p>
<p>（十）最闊的人　華懋等飯店的盛餐　大洋十五元至五十元</p>
<p>從「不名一文」起至一販數十金止的吃客。或許會依次妒忌的。但是能夠「裝飽肚子。」總是上上了。我們想到那億萬個被災的同胞。他們的五官四肢五　六腑。難道和我們的生得不同嗎。連草根樹皮都覓不到。做一個「倒冷飯」同志。着賢没有福分哩。</p>

<p>要辦的事便是收　　　　　老百姓呢，天生來就是給他們皮　筋的。等到只剩幾根骨頭的時候，他們還要來吸我們的骨髓！老百姓和官老爺之間便是這樣的。可是我家裏的人全給砲火殺盡了，我家的草棚子也給燒得找不着方向了。只留着我一個光桿兒在義勇軍的隊伍裏，我手裏有的是槍，再看他們來向我要錢罷，我可以給他一粒子彈。　　兵甲：對了，痛快！可是還有許多多没有槍的呢？他們怎樣？他們就等着死嗎？</p>
<p>兵乙：那還不是一樣，不願死的到義勇軍裏面來！</p>
<p>兵丙：（自左急忙上）快走，快走，日本兵來清鄕了。</p>
<p>兵辛：有多少人？</p>
<p>兵丙：不知道，聽說不過是百多條槍，是這裏的村長請來的，快要進村了。　　兵甲：我們爲什麽要走呢？是隊長的命令嗎？</p>
<p>兵丙：那當然囉，他說我們人少，他們人多，我們犯不着損失實力。</p>
<p>兵辛：這說得很對，我們暫時散開一下，回頭等他們走了再說。</p>
<p>兵甲：不，這是什麽話？我們又不是和日本兵捉迷藏，我們爲什麽要躱開呢？我們到什麽地方去襲擊他們。　　兵乙：好的，我們到這邊村口去埋伏起來。（見排長自左上。）排長，我們還有一架機關槍，爲什麽要逃呢？這邊村口有一條小路，兩面是山，他們回去一定要走那兒過的。</p>
<p>兵戊：對了，那一條路我也知道得清楚，間直不必用槍，只消在兩面山上倒些大石塊下去，都可以將他們打死得乾乾凈凈。</p>
<p>兵丙：但是隊長的命令要我們退。</p>
<p>排長：那没有關係，隊長不會不准我們打日本兵的。可是你們都知道那一條　？</p>
<p>兵戊：知道的，我負責任好了。</p>

<p>靑年：七八天以前周三爺跑到我家裏收債，你想這個時候兒誰還有錢還債呢？我說「没有」。「没有嗎？」他說：「没有就可了事嗎？」我說「你打算怎麽的？」後來他說：「和的，你等着罷，看你還不還我。」就因爲這樣，他恨極了，跑到縣城裏去告我，說我是漢奸。說我勾通日軍，勾通什麽李ＸＸ的步隊，和政府作對。你想他無恥呀。</p>

        <h1>1933.10.16</h1>
<h3>Fang Ji Surrounded on All Sides, in a Very Difficult Situation. Japanese Soldiers Launch Fierce Artillery Attacks, National Army Strictly Blocks and Intercepts. Wang Zhongfu Arrives in Beiping to Negotiate Reorganization. He Yingqin Proposes that Fang Ji First Leave the Army. Fang Ji Has No Sincere Intention to Accept the Conditions. Japanese Planes Bomb Fang's Position.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang Ji's two units fled to the Dulinzhuang area, they were in constant contact with the Shunyi garrison. Yesterday's battle was relatively fierce. At the same time, in order to prevent Fang Ji's troops from heading east, the Japanese army used seventy military vehicles two days ago to transport Japanese soldiers from Gubeikou to the south of Niulanshan to attack Fang Ji's two units. Each vehicle carried fifteen or sixteen people, totaling about a thousand people. Yesterday, they began shelling Fang Ji's two units, and the shelling continued until night. The sound of artillery rumbled, and it could be heard clearly in Miyun and Huairou. This morning, the sound of artillery was intermittent, and it stopped slightly at noon. There was no fighting in the afternoon. Fang Ji's two units are now surrounded on all sides and are in a very difficult situation. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin convened a meeting of generals at Jurentang yesterday to discuss in detail the disposition of Fang Ji's remnant troops. At 11 o'clock last night, Fang sent Division Commander Wang Zhongfu and Ji's Division Commander Zhang Yangxin, and Chief of Staff Ma Yingming to Beiping to meet with military and political authorities and negotiate reorganization methods. It is said that Fang Ji still intends to request that Changping and Shunyi be designated as his defense areas. Wang, Zhang, and Ma returned to Dongxi Dulinzhuang to report. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military dispatch: Yesterday afternoon at around 3 o'clock, in order to prevent Fang Ji's remnant troops from fleeing east, the Japanese army transferred a unit of artillery from Miyun and fired more than a hundred shells at Fang's position. At the same time, two Japanese planes dropped six or seven bombs in the Dongxi Dulinzhuang area, causing heavy damage to Fang's troops. This morning, two more Japanese planes flew to Fang's position and bombed, and the extent of the damage is unknown. Our army is currently monitoring the situation closely, fearing that they will flee elsewhere. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji's representatives Wang Zhongfu and others passed through the defense line of General Shang Zhen and were led by Shang Zhen to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin for a long talk. Wang and others left at 6 o'clock this morning. It is advocated here that Fang Ji must first leave the army and be conveyed to Wang and others. There has been no response as of this afternoon. It is said that Fang Ji will never accept the authorities' proposal. Sending Wang and others to Beiping this time is still a formality. Wang Zhongfu has been dismissed by Fang. It is said that he will not leave Beiping. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shunyi telegraphs that Fang Ji's army, entrenched in Dongxi Dulinzhuang in Xiangmen Village, has no ability to escape due to the strict defense and interception by the National Army. Yesterday afternoon, from 2 to 4 o'clock, the National Army used artillery fire to threaten Xiangmen Village. Ji's soldiers were scattered in the field, and the order was very chaotic. Fang Youjun was in the army, and the general headquarters was located in the Guandi Temple in Dulinzhuang. There were more than two thousand people in Fang's unit, under Fang's personal command. A temporary grain and food supply office was set up in the village to forcibly extort money from the village chiefs and deputy chiefs of each village. If they did not pay the grain and food supply, they would pay cash. Today at around 6 o'clock, two Japanese planes flew to Fang's army's position and dropped eleven bombs, destroying several houses in Dulinzhuang. Dozens of Fang's soldiers were killed or injured, and more than twenty farmers were killed or injured. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang Ji led his troops to collapse, there were still a few remnants near Tangshan and the Ming Tombs. The National Army is currently searching and suppressing them. In the Niulanshan area, there are currently more than seven hundred Japanese troops restricting Fang Ji's remnant troops from fleeing east. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army stationed in Miyun, Shixia Town, and Gubeikou has about thirty or forty soldiers in each place. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li Jichun's Troops Departed Eastward from Luanzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Changli: Li Jichun's troops left Luanzhou by train on the 15th and departed eastward for Beidaihe. Magistrate Liang presented Captain Fu, who was injured in the Zhanggezhuang battle, with one hundred yuan in recognition of the Security Team's courageous resistance. All sectors of Changli also raised eight hundred yuan, which was distributed to the injured and deceased police officers. The First District Defense Regiment was ordered to defend and block Lu'ankou. Yesterday morning, bandits heading to Huan were repelled by the regiment, and one hostage was rescued, and four donkeys and mules were shot down. There are no traces of bandits on the west bank of the Yanghe River. Representatives of the Funing people visited Magistrate Liang on the 15th, requesting that Liu Xingpei be transferred back east. The people plan to recover Funing. There are currently about six hundred bandits inside and outside Funing City. The bandit leaders seem to be Haijiao and Erlong. After being killed by us, the bandits are offering rewards to find their remains. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Arrives in Beiping with Qin Dechun. Representatives from Tang and Liu Also Arrive. They Declare that They Did Not Conspire with Fang Ji.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan arrived in Beiping tonight from Zhangjiakou with Qin Dechun, Yang Zhennan, Tian Gangyi, representative of Liu Guitang, Wu Jiabin, commander of Tang's troops, and Sun, a representative. Tomorrow morning, they will meet with He Yingqin to report on the handling of military affairs and the aftermath in Chahar Province. Song said that he came here because he received a telegram from Huang Shao-hsiung, setting the 18th as the date for a plenary meeting, so he rushed to participate. The military and political aftermath in Chahar Province has been largely handled, and local order in various counties is gradually being restored. A small number of remaining soldiers and bandits have begun to be suppressed. The rumors circulating in Beiping that Liu Jiatang and Tang Yulin's troops joined forces with Fang Ji's two units are not true. He specifically invited one or two representatives from Liu and Tang to come to Beiping to meet with He Yingqin and report on the recent situation of the two units. The matter of Prince De of Inner Mongolia convening an autonomy conference has not yielded results because there are very few adherents, so it will not become a major problem. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun said that the various mixed troops in Chahar Province have been completely reorganized. The remaining infantry have been handed over to Zhao Dengyu to lead, and the cavalry have been handed over to Yun Rong to lead. There are another seven or eight hundred infantrymen who will serve as road protection teams. The urgent matter remaining to be handled in Chahar Province is to suppress the bandits in the Zhangbei area. Zhao Dengyu has been appointed as the commander for bandit suppression, and Zhang Yunrong as the deputy commander. Before coming to Beiping, he specifically summoned Zhao Dengyu to Zhangjiakou and gave him instructions in person. Zhao plans to return to Zhangbei immediately and begin suppressing the bandits in various units. Tang and Liu's troops are still stationed in their original defense area in Dushikou and have not been moved. However, a unit of bandits previously reorganized by Tang's troops fled a few days ago and came south along the route taken by Fang Ji's troops, seemingly to join Fang's unit. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Advance Team Arrives at the Border Between Ningxia and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's advance team is successively departing westward from Baotou and arriving at Dengkou, at the border between Ningxia and Suiyuan. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Baoping, Sun Dianying's representative, said that after receiving the order to depart for the Qinghai Western District for land reclamation, Ma Hongkui of Ningxia telegraphed our commander, expressing his welcome. Recently, he received another telegram from Ma, suddenly saying that he had received an order from Zhu Shaoliang, prohibiting the establishment of supply stations and the passage of troops within the territory. Our army immediately relayed the telegram to He Yingqin to report everything. He Yingqin said that after receiving our army's report, he immediately telegraphed Ma to inquire about the truth. He just received a reply from Ma saying that he had indeed received Zhu's order. He Yingqin has telegraphed Zhu again to inquire about the truth. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bandits Attack Salt Flats in Tanggu</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A large number of bandits attacked the salt flats in Tanggu at around 11 o'clock on the night of the 14th. They were repelled by our cavalry. The salt fields contribute greatly to revenue. Residents of Tanggu suddenly heard gunfire and, not knowing the truth, all closed their doors and extinguished their lights. Both Chinese and Japanese troops were also on alert at the same time to prevent bandit disturbances. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Arrives in Xunyang, Transfers to Lushan to Meet Chiang. Yin and Li Go to Beijing to Meet Wang for Instructions.</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Wang Jingwei arrived in Xunyang on the 14th aboard a Keishi aircraft and transferred to Lushan to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss important political affairs, including Inner Mongolian autonomy, provincial and county system reforms, economic revitalization after the establishment of the Bandit Suppression and Relief Committee, and bandit suppression in North China. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong and Li Zeyi went to Beijing, carrying a mission from Huang Shao-hsiung, to report to Wang Jingwei on the handling of North China's diplomatic issues after Huang's arrival in Beiping and the situation of Sugimura's visit to Beiping. They also requested instructions regarding Yin and Li's eastward journey. After Wang meets with Chiang in Jiangxi, a decision will be made. Yin will arrive in Beijing tonight and return to Beiping if necessary after meeting with Wang, before heading east. Li Zeyi will travel by sea from Shanghai to Dalian and then transfer to Changchun. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Committee Chairman Huang telegraphed that there has been progress in negotiations with Japan and that the Bandit Suppression Army is opening up eastern Luan. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Branch Issues Inspection Regulations for Garrison Troops. Ji Yiqiao and Others Depart Today.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin previously appointed Ji Yiqiao as the Chief Inspector of the Jinpu Line and convened meetings of the inspection committee members for days to discuss the inspection procedures. Today, the Military Branch issued inspection regulations. Ji Yiqiao and other inspection committee members have finalized the inspection procedures and are scheduled to depart from Beiping tomorrow morning to inspect Yu Xuezhong's First Army in Tianjin first, and then head south along the Jinpu Line, transferring from Pang County to the Hejian Anci area. The inspection is expected to be completed in about twenty days. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Feng Zhanhai's Troops Ordered to Transfer Defense to the Huairou-Zhuolu Area</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Zhanhai's troops have recently been ordered by the Military Branch to transfer their defense to the Huairou, Zhuolu, and Yanqing areas. The people of these three counties have specially sent representatives to Beiping to petition the Military Branch and telegram Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin, requesting that the transfer be temporarily suspended. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sheng Shicai Telegraphs that He is Advancing to Suppress Ma Zhongying and Personally Leading Troops to Tuban.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sheng Shicai telegraphed Beiping, stating that for this campaign to suppress Ma Zhongying, all troops were drawn from the old units of the Jilin, Heilongjiang, Soviet, and Mongolian armies. After taking an oath in Xinjiang on the tenth, he personally led the troops from Xinjiang to Tuban on the eleventh to suppress Ma's rebel troops and eliminate harm for the people of Xinjiang. He expects to resolve the situation completely within two weeks. This departure was welcomed by the people of Xinjiang, and Ma Shaowu, the administrative head of Kashgar, also expressed his willingness to serve as the vanguard of Ma Zhongying's rebel troops and has now gathered old troops to await deployment. The overall situation in Xinjiang is expected to stabilize in the short term. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Russian Planes Reconnoiter Rehe Airspace</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Rehe reported that three days ago, three Russian planes suddenly flew from Outer Mongolia to Rehe and circled over Chengde for three hours. The fuselage was silver-colored, and they flew very high. The piloting skills were extremely skilled. The Japanese garrison in Rehe used anti-aircraft guns to fire on them. After a while, the Russian planes turned north and flew away. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Detain Korean in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Several Japanese people, on the 12th, drove in a Japanese consular car from Shamian to Zhuyuan, Fuyin Village, Dongshan, and forcibly detained Park Yiyi, a Korean national with Shanghai County citizenship, put him in the car, and drove him back to the Japanese consulate. The Guangzhou Municipal Government has protested to the Japanese consulate. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Discusses Provincial System</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju said that he believes that both the provincial governor system and the committee system are good. In short, governance depends on the person. Major powers still have imperial systems, which is clear evidence of this. To revitalize the countryside, it is necessary to increase people's production and protect the export of products. If a committee is established today and a research institute is established tomorrow, it will not only not increase people's production but will increase the burden, which is absolutely unacceptable. The district chief's avoidance of native place will be completed in three phases. The militia will be transferred to the province for training in three phases. This province will never extra extort a single penny from merchants and civilians; it has no other strength. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Telegraphed that He Will Stay in Denmark for a Short Time</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang recently sent a telegram to Beiping reporting that he is currently in Copenhagen, Denmark, visiting Danish industry and commerce.

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong's Departure to Mongolia Undecided. He Plans to Go with Zhangjia.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong said that the departure to Mongolia is around the 20th. He is currently purchasing silk, tea, and other gifts to present to the princes and nobles of various leagues and banners when he arrives in Mongolia to express his personal intentions. The central government's outline for handling Mongolian autonomy has been discussed but still awaits formal decision by the Executive Yuan. Zhangjia is currently in Beiping and plans to accompany him to Mongolia. It is not certain where the Panchen Lama is now. After arriving in Mongolia, in addition to going to Zhangjiakou, he also plans to visit other leagues and banners if time permits. He will return to Nanjing in about a month to report.

<p>(Nanjing) Bai Rui and other Mongolian compatriots in Beijing wrote to Prince De, asking him to pay attention to national defense and prevent the invasion of violent Japanese as the most important principles for preparing for Mongolian autonomy. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guihua: Shi Huayan, the General Manager of Sui Reclamation Affairs, was dispatched by telegram from Yan Xishan, and on the ninth, he visited the Panchen Lama in the Fourth Prince's residence. Because the Panchen moved to the Xialamuluo Temple, ninety miles north of the Prince's residence, on the same day to chant scriptures and spread the Dharma, Shi chased after him. He returned to Sui after the audience on the thirteenth. Shi said that according to the Panchen, the occurrence of Inner Mongolian autonomy was due to: first, the estrangement between the Mongolians and the interior; second, the influence of Outer and Eastern Mongolia; and third, the Chahar Incident. At present, most of the princes and nobles and the Mongolian people still lean toward the central government and hope that Huang and Zhao will come early to discuss together and quickly formulate a proper solution. Shi said that the Panchen returned to Jialing Temple from Xia on the fourteenth. According to reliable official news, Prince De convened two meetings at Bailing, but both were inconclusive because too few people attended. On August 20 of the lunar calendar, a meeting was hastily convened again. Prince De proposed to organize an autonomous organization at a suitable location and was nominated as the drafter of the autonomous regulations, but none of the committee members responded. In September, Fu Zuoyi sent personnel to various banners to investigate and comfort them. All the members have now returned to Suiyuan. According to the loyal intent of the Mongolian banners toward the central government, there was no one who was not pleased. In particular, the Awang of Ikh Juu League and the Fourth Prince of Govi Altai League were the most sincere. The princes and nobles all hoped that Minister Huang would go north to listen to the guidance of the central government. Members sent back to the province have brought official letters from the leaders of the various leagues, mostly stating that they did not know about the Pangjiang telegram. According to the most confidential news, the personnel from various banners who attended the meeting in the Ulanqab League temple expressed to others that they were forced to come here. After returning to their banners, they would formally declare that they did not support this matter. They requested that it be confidentially reported to Chairman Fu and conveyed to the central government to avoid being implicated in the future. Reports that the Suiyuan provincial government sent troops to the temple to suppress the Inner Mongolian conference are entirely rumors fabricated by bad people to stir up trouble and are absolutely untrue.

<h3>From Colonial Economy to Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>Controlled economy. This has now become an issue of national attention. We believe that under the goal of developing the national economy, what should be deeply understood is not whether economic control should be sought, but whether a controlled economy can be controlled. If this level is not recognized, the result may be drawing a tiger but resembling a dog, which is useless and harmful.</p>
<p>The realization of a controlled economy must have the following preconditions:</p>
<p>First, there must be a financially strong central hub. In general capitalist countries with extremely developed economies, there is the Bank of England in the UK, the Federal Reserve Bank in the US, and the Bank of Japan in the neighboring Japan. These central banks can exert supreme power in terms of overall foreign exchange, unified issuance, and control of credit. In our country, in addition to the Central Bank, even with the support of extremely large domestic commercial banks, it is still not enough to reduce the power of foreign banks. The power of foreign banks lies in absorbing huge amounts of deposits and controlling overall foreign exchange. Not only do they issue their own banknotes, but they can also refuse to accept our country's bank notes. In this case, if strict methods of controlled economy are to be implemented, it will inevitably be like chasing sparrows with a jungle, which is useless and harmful. Moreover, the position of these [foreign banks' power] in our country's financial market is no different from their position in India, Nanyang, and Hong Kong. They have long since gradually reduced our country to the level of a colony. In this way, how can control be effective?</p>
<p>Second, there must be methods to control foreign capital and commodities. In many European and American countries at present, the activities of foreign capital are mostly managed by the government and limited to a very small scope. The import and export of foreign commodities are absolutely subject to strict state supervision. These are all strict controls that they have implemented in order to save the crisis in their domestic industry and commerce. What about our country? Commodity imports exceed exports by as much as 90 million yuan annually. Foreign capital in China has exceeded one million yuan, and the annual increase in investment is no less than 200 million. If controlled economy is to seek a fundamental solution, it must first restrict the activities of foreign capital and commodities in our country's market.</p>
<p>The main significance of controlled economy must be to cultivate the accumulation of domestic capital and guide the upward trend of industrial and commercial profits. It cannot be achieved by chanting empty slogans or engaging in minor matters. As far as our country's current agricultural, industrial, commercial, and national economy are concerned, there is indeed a need to seek control in order to save the crisis. But if its preconditions are not paid attention to, how can a controlled economy be realized? Therefore, the center of the problem should be to first study how to break away from the current colonial economy.</p>
<h3>Bangkok Turns into a Battlefield. The Government is Confident it Can Control the Overall Situation.</h3>
<p>Bangkok - Government forces defending Bangkok are bombarding with artillery.</p>
<p>The rebellious crowd led by Prince Bovaradej, the former Prince of the Revolution, cannot advance. Fierce fighting is still in progress. The sound of artillery can be heard here, but details of the war are unknown due to strict inspection. Two reconnaissance planes on the side of the revolutionary army flew over Bangkok yesterday. One plane was shot down into the river. The government has repeatedly stated that it is definitely able to control the overall situation, so the public is a little more at ease today. Residents in the suburbs were warned by the authorities and are now flocking to the city for refuge. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Discovery of Anti-Manchu Officials</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The authorities recently arrested a Manchu official of the Chinese Eastern Railway after discovering a conspiracy to overthrow the [Manchu] government. The person's surname and name have not yet been released, but it is said that he is the chief of a certain section. His office was searched, and various documents of conspiracy were found. The head of the Japanese Special Police announced this matter today, saying that detectives are still investigating thoroughly and hope to arrest several people behind the scenes within days.

<h3>Germany's Disconnection with the League of Nations, Armed Nations Take it as an Ally, Strengthen the Belief in Expanding Military Strength. British Prime Minister Grasps the Key to Salvaging the European Situation. Difficulties in the Disarmament Issue. New Ways Will Be Found to Solve It. The General Committee is Scheduled to Meet Today.</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This time, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations served as an opportunity to cooperate with Japan, which has the same position. It is also a matter of concern whether Japan's shipbuilding movement will stimulate it. Europe, especially London, is very worried. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is handling this matter with extreme calmness. The following is a record of its views: (1) Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations this time is to break away from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles as a defeated country and seek a way out to establish its national equality. This is a natural and foreseeable move. Japan has no sense of surprise. (2) Japan only seeks to thoroughly exercise its foreign policy. It is not necessary to participate in the liquidation of European changes. Europe is Europe, Asia is Asia. The national opinion has completely agreed to decide its own policy based on this individual concept. (3) In view of this national opinion, Europeans believe that Japan will cooperate with Germany or have some attempt, holding a dangerous view. This is ironclad evidence that European countries still lack an understanding of the Far East and is also the reason why Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. (4) The discussion that Japan will launch a shipbuilding movement can also be said to be a prelude to German-Japanese cooperation. However, Japan's shipbuilding is within the quality and quantity allowed by the London Treaty, so this situation is nothing more than a solitary worry. (15th Japanese United News Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Militarists Sympathetic to Germany</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the Japanese naval authorities view it with unusual gravity. Their opinions are as follows: Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference is a very significant issue. It will be especially difficult to resolve the disarmament conference in the future. Even British Prime Minister MacDonald said that if the disarmament conference fails to be resolved, Europe will fall into chaos. This shows that this is not just a major problem for Europe, but a major problem for the world. (15th, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the occurrence of Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference, the Japanese army authorities' speculation is as follows: After the great excitement of the European war, and then being bound by the Treaty of Paris, the national sentiment of Germany has been strengthened. At the disarmament conference, they requested equality of armaments with England, France, and Italy, which is something that deserves sympathy. However, the country actually carried out the withdrawal from the disarmament conference. It can be seen that they have no regard for Germany and cannot reduce their armaments, so it is natural that they will fall apart. The reason is very clear. However, regarding this case, what Hitler's decision will be and what his attitude will be in the future are the most interesting questions. From now on, the nationalism of various countries will become increasingly stronger, and the powers will become opposing not only in terms of armaments, but also economically. (15th, Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Strategy to Undergo Changes</h3>
<p>Diplomacy and international influence are very significant. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito ordered Foreign Minister Hirota to investigate the truth. Foreign Minister Hirota will report on the details at tomorrow's five-minister conference. At the same time, he will also express the empire's determination regarding future diplomatic policies. Furthermore, Minister of the Army Araki and Minister of the Navy Osumi believe that if the League of Nations and the disarmament conference become nominal, the countries of Europe and the United States may shift towards nationalism, and establishing national policies in Japan will be even more important. Therefore, the five-minister conference is more noteworthy than before. (15th, Den Tsushin)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Broadcast Speech Condemns Victorious Nations: Countries Use Oppression as Their Skill; Peace is Based on Sincere Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler made a broadcast speech here tonight, which was broadcast nationwide by various German radio stations, stating that if France and Germany can eliminate violence from their common lives, it will be a great undertaking for all mankind.</p>
<h3>Obey the Peace Treaty, Sheathe Our Swords</h3>
<p>Hitler recalled the events since the armistice in 1918, saying that at that time, Germany trusted President Wilson's Fourteen Points, so it sheathed its swords. If the world had extended its hand to the broken country in a fair manner in the years after the armistice, mankind could have saved countless hardships. Germany has exhausted its efforts to heal the wounds of its enemies. When Germany obeyed the peace treaty and destroyed weapons in order to facilitate world disarmament, all the people of the world thought that this was the starting point of common-sense victory.</p>
<h3>Victorious Nations' Arrogant Attitude is Oppressive</h3>
<p>Germany has the right to hope that the rest of the world will fulfill its promises, but unfortunately, the political leaders of other countries are all arrogant people with the air of victors. They do not know that the recovery of the world depends on the sincere cooperation of all countries and the elimination of the psychology of war, not on the slave labor of the ravaged countries. All the belligerent countries are confident that they have not committed the crime of willingly being the leader of the army. Since they have this confidence, they should not have permanent enmity and deliberately retain the memory of the catastrophe.</p>
<h3>No War Fantasies Against France</h3>
<p>Although the German people demand the rights promised by the peace treaty, Germany has no territorial disputes other than the disputes between France and Germany. When the Saar region is returned to Germany, anyone with a clear understanding will not have the illusion that war can break out between France and Germany. German youth do not engage in demonstrations against France, but only focus on the political movements necessary to curb communism. If all countries in the world build indestructible fortresses, build huge aircraft, heavy artillery, and tanks for their own purposes, then one cannot accuse the National Socialist Party, which marches in unarmed formations, of being a great harm to the world.</p>
<h3>Not Willing to Live in an Inferior Position</h3>
<p>Other countries all have the right to self-defense, but Germany alone does not. This is simply treating the German people as a lower class. The people currently in power in Germany are completely different from the bribed traitors of November 1918. We are not responsible for the war, nor are we responsible for the events that occurred in the war, but we are responsible for doing something for our suffering people, as anyone with a sense of honor must do. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Slander Against Germany Intensifies</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler said in his speech that various countries have slandered Germany in various ways, such as the ridiculous drama of holding an investigation in London regarding the [German Reichstag fire case]. This is something that Germany cannot tolerate. He also said, [The French government under the leadership of the current Prime Minister says that there is no intention to threaten or insult the German nation. We are deeply moved by this and have hope for the future. We respectfully listen to this statement].</p>
<h3>Military Equality is All We Seek</h3>
<p>He then said that Germany does not demand rearmament; what it seeks is only equality of rights. Therefore, if the international community recognizes that certain countries can set up certain weapons, then, based on the principle of equality, Germany can also set them up. If this is denied, it is actually treating Germany as a second-class country, which Germany cannot accept. Germany joined the League of Nations and the disarmament conference originally hoping that the German nation would enjoy equal rights with other nations. If this cannot be done, it is actually inflicting an unbearable insult on Germany. When Hitler made this statement, his voice was extremely high. He went on to say that all countries have made promises to reduce armaments, and Germany has fulfilled its obligations to the extreme. At this time, other countries with powerful armaments should fulfill their promises. Hitler also said that the German race requires no threat to other countries. What Germany demands is not the establishment of offensive weapons, but the establishment of defensive weapons that all countries can possess and are not prohibited by future disarmament.</p>
<h3>Sincere Cooperation, Hope for Peace</h3>
<p>Hitler concluded, [We are representatives of an honest nation and are ourselves people who cherish honor. Therefore, we cannot participate in certain constructions that only people who disregard honor can tolerate. It is only beneficial to negotiate with people who cherish honor in the international community. Why associate with unreliable people and enter into treaties with them? All countries in the world should consider the sense of honor of such governments. Only in this kind of atmosphere can a method of building peace be carried out.</p>
<h3>Congressional Re-election to Gauge Public Opinion</h3>
<p>The current German government has dissolved the House of Representatives and is holding re-elections to gauge German public opinion. All countries in the world should know that the German government's love of peace and its concern for honor can represent the same psychology of the German people. He also said that this move is to allow the people to express their faith and will have significant value in history. The government is making the people vote not only to make them approve of the principles adopted by the government, but also to make them deeply believe in these principles and become one with them.</p>
<h3>Vow to Fight for Equality and Honor</h3>
<p>Hitler concluded, [All countries in the world, seeing this kind of expression, must deeply believe that the German government and the people are united in the struggle for equality and honor. The German government and the people have only one hope: to help the world end the era of painful mistakes and regrettable hatred, and that the people of Europe, who are least related to world civilization, will all be reconciled]. Hitler's speech was broadcast at one o'clock in the morning (local time) and was translated into English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese for broadcast abroad. (14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>The Door to Negotiations on the Disarmament Issue is Not Closed: Seeking a Clever Way to Break the Deadlock; France Suggests Inviting the British Prime Minister to be a Peacemaker</h3>
<p>Rome: It was announced this afternoon that [The situation has reached this point and should be examined in its current state, and possible methods should be studied to reach a compromise]. It also stated that Prime Minister Hitler's tone did not block the door to negotiations, but [Since Germany has withdrawn from the disarmament conference, the disarmament conference cannot continue to be held. It is bound to be postponed until the necessary and sufficient conditions are realized before the overall problem is fully discussed anew]. (15th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Germany's sudden withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference was completely unexpected. The reactions of politicians from various countries have caused a common feeling in diplomatic circles here that the situation cannot be taken lightly. A very clever way must be found to allow the countries to reach a common understanding, and then the issue of the Saar can be thoroughly discussed. After carefully examining the opinions within the capitals of major countries, many politicians are looking to Britain to provide the key to the solution. The French side has especially informally suggested that British Prime Minister MacDonald be invited to be a peacemaker again. In addition, several informal suggestions have been put forward in diplomatic circles, and British officials are seriously considering them. Some diplomats believe that Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and the United States will therefore increase the opportunity to draft a disarmament convention. In the future, Germany may be invited to participate again. Opinions from all sides seem to indicate that this matter has gone beyond the issue of armaments and that the entire post-war peace structure must be inspected and slightly modified in several aspects. It is expected that the first step will be a frank and thorough discussion with Germany, led by Britain. Regarding this matter, the German Foreign Ministry has notified the British ambassador and entrusted him to forward it to London, and also notified the chairman of the disarmament conference, Henderson. Henderson also said that he had received a letter stating that he would submit it to the General Committee on Disarmament. It is expected that if Britain takes the lead, its progress will be calm and based on completely accurate information. (15th, Kokumin)</p>
<h3>Six-Nation Representatives Draft a Reply to Germany: Disarmament Conference Likely to be Postponed</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The disarmament representatives of the six countries met this morning for two hours and will meet again at 5:00 p.m. to draft a reply to the note from Germany to the chairman of the disarmament conference, Henderson. Germany's letter pointed out that armed countries are unwilling to fulfill their disarmament guarantees. (15th, Kokumin)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the major countries gathered this morning at the residence of the chairman of the disarmament conference, Henderson, to discuss whether the disarmament conference should continue to be held after Monday. Among the participants were British Foreign Secretary Simon, US Ambassador Davis, Italian representative Scogna, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. (15th, Kokumin)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference and the League of Nations, the fate of the disarmament conference is currently unknown. Some delegations, especially the British delegation, advocate that the meeting must be postponed. As for the US delegation, it advocates continuing to work, as does the French delegation, but it is not as resolute as the US delegation. It is generally believed that the General Committee on Disarmament will still meet on Monday as originally scheduled. The agenda of the General Committee will roughly remain the same, that is, British Prime Minister Simon will first make a statement (he notified the Presidium yesterday), and then US representative Davis will restate the various principles approved by the Presidium yesterday. However, whether the General Committee will continue to work after that or will be postponed will only be determined when Chairman Henderson meets with the representatives of France, Britain, and Italy, as well as the rapporteur of the General Committee, Beyens. This meeting is scheduled to be held at 11:00 a.m. today, and the situation caused by Germany's actions will be studied in all aspects at the meeting. It is generally expected that the following procedure will be agreed upon: the General Committee will first listen to the report of British Foreign Secretary Simon, and then all delegations will exchange opinions and propose a motion containing the various principles already passed by the Presidium. The representatives will vote on the motion, and then the General Committee will be postponed, and the task of drafting the disarmament convention will be handed over to a drafting committee. This convention will only be implemented after Germany resumes international cooperation. (15th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Davis Reads a Document Opposing German Rearmament</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Representative Davis read a document from the US government at the non-public disarmament conference in Geneva today. The State Department explained that the United States, in agreement with the Allied Powers in the Great War, opposes Germany's rearmament and supports the disarmament plan that has now caused Germany to withdraw from Geneva. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Geneva Hears a Bolt From the Blue</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The German government's decision not to participate in the disarmament conference and to withdraw from the League of Nations was delivered to the League of Nations approximately one hour after the Presidium of the disarmament conference met. The news caused a great shock to public opinion, as people generally expected that the Berlin government would not show such surprising resistance and dissatisfaction beforehand. The disappointment and anger of the American people were no less than those of others, and they said that this morning, the German representatives in Geneva still asked the American representatives to find a way to prevent the speeches that US representative Davis and British representative Simon were about to deliver from being too firm, so as not to cause a stalemate. The reason why the British and American representatives used a cooperative tone to speak for Germany was because of this. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, Germany suddenly announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference, cutting off its own retreat. This was truly unexpected. It should be noted that Germany joined the League of Nations in September 1926 (that is, after the Treaty of Locarno was signed). This withdrawal from the League of Nations happened to be after Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. The League of Nations has suffered this serious blow, and the progress of all its affairs will encounter obstacles. As for the disarmament conference, it is now in an extremely dangerous position. However, the situation is very clear. Germany's participation in the disarmament conference was originally very reluctant. Its dealings with various countries on the green carpet were only to achieve its political goals, not to cooperate internationally. If the goal is not achieved, it will leave in a huff. Looking at it now, it is extremely obvious. (14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Paris Believes the Situation is Serious</h3>
<p>(Paris) Tonight, French officials admitted that the news of Germany's notification of its withdrawal from the disarmament conference and the League of Nations came as a complete surprise.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>Those willing to comment on this matter mostly say that it is undeniable that this is the worst situation encountered by the League of Nations since the European War. Many French newspapers expect that countries will immediately begin an arms race, but some also believe that there is still hope of establishing an agreement with Germany, and advocate inviting British Prime Minister MacDonald to mediate and convene a new conference of the great powers to maintain peace. (14th, Kokuminsha)</p>
<h3>American Mediation Becomes a Soap Bubble</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US government feels that Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference is actually equivalent to the failure of two years of efforts to negotiate a disarmament agreement. Secretary of State Hull deeply regrets this action by the Germans, saying that the United States has tried its best to cooperate with the countries attending Geneva in order to cultivate a spirit of friendship and peace and avoid the occurrence of such events today. The United States had hoped that countries would continue discussions to reach a solution. Germany's actions not only hinder the entire disarmament movement, but may even bring it to a halt. It was also learned from other sources that although the United States supports Britain and France's opposition to Germany's immediate rearmament, it has also worked hard to seek understanding regarding the right to equal armaments within the security system in the future. (14th, Kokumin)</p>
<h3>British Political Circles Adopt a Calm Attitude</h3>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald is currently resting at his country villa, but he is fully aware of the current situation and will return to his residence tonight. The British cabinet will probably have a formal discussion on the disarmament difficulties on Monday. British officials still maintain a calm attitude towards the disarmament difficulties. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Remains Silent</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini remains silent on this matter, but other key members openly admit that they do not know what to do. They say that it is difficult to comment since Germany ultimately did not violate the Four-Power Pact. (15th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian officials today denied the claim that Italy will follow Germany in withdrawing from disarmament and the League of Nations, saying that it was fabricated by Paris and has no basis, and is inconsistent with Mussolini's aim of cooperating with other countries for peace. (15th, Kokumin)</p>
<h3>German Delegation Leaves for Home</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After Germany announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference, the German delegation to the disarmament conference left Geneva tonight. Before leaving, even the reporters dispatched by the German press to Geneva with the German delegation were unwilling to meet. The German delegation claimed that it no longer had the right to express Germany's opinions, so meeting with the press was of no use. (14th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Preparations Made Long Ago for Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The decision of Germany to withdraw from the League of Nations disarmament conference has been prepared for several days, which can be seen from the speed of the German government's actions. The German government's announcement of the declaration was already swift, and at the same time, it promulgated laws to fundamentally revise the constitutional order. This kind of internal reorganization is of utmost importance, and everyone can see it. Recently, although the German government has made extreme efforts to intensify propaganda, the situation of the German people has not improved much, and the German people cannot help but be disappointed. In order to shift the focus, Chancellor Hitler took the surprising action of withdrawing from the League of Nations, which boosted the morale of the people. Hitler's holding of a referendum after withdrawing from the League of Nations shows that his purpose is to increase his prestige domestically. The German government also wants to take the opportunity to expand the central concentration of power, completely place the German government under the dictatorship of the Nazi Party, and completely change the nature of the German state. As for diplomatic issues, Hitler must have no intention of breaking off relations. This can be seen from the speech made by Hitler. He saw that the situation in Geneva was unfavorable to Germany, so he took the opportunity to withdraw. People here believe that after Germany withdraws from the disarmament conference, the Four-Power Treaty can still be used as a remedy, so there is no need to worry about being unable to do anything. The Fourth Power Treaty is based on the League of Nations Covenant. Germany has actually neglected it and announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, so the Fourth Power Treaty is also unable to be cited. This is something that Hitler has not seen.

<h3>Takes Effect Two Years Later</h3>
<p>(London) Germany's resolution to withdraw from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference caused panic among the general public, who rushed to newspaper vendors to buy special editions containing the news. The general public was shocked by this news, but those who pay attention to politics had already anticipated that it might take this action, given Germany's unwillingness to make any concessions in Geneva yesterday. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations cannot take effect within two years, but it will be like Japan, no longer sending representatives to participate in any meetings of the League of Nations. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Reliable sources claimed today that the German government's intention to withdraw from the International League and the disarmament conference is to actually withdraw, but everything should be done as smoothly as possible. It also stated that Germany will still adhere to all regulations during the two-year transition period, such as paying membership fees. (15th, Kokumin)</p>
<h3>Congressional Re-election is an Internal Tactic</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the German cabinet learned of the content of British Foreign Secretary Simon's speech in Geneva, it made this major decision. After the cabinet decided to withdraw from the League of Nations, German Chancellor Hitler immediately went to see President Hindenburg. The German president ultimately agreed to this decision. Hitler's resolution to appeal to the people is a tactic that allows Hitler to obtain the support of an absolute majority of the people. This is merely asking voters whether they are willing to elect National Socialist Party candidates. In fact, people outside the party are not allowed to be elected. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>French Government's Position Shaken</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government's position may be affected by Germany's resolution, because the financial plan established by the Ministry of the Interior this morning has no chance of passing. If so, Prime Minister Daladier will resign. Germany's action will allow the French opposition party, which does not approve of Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour's disarmament policy, to have new weapons to attack the government. The French government recognizes that the situation is serious, but its attitude is still calm. They do not know whether Germany is merely making grand statements to seek concessions, or whether it is actually closing the doors to peace and reconciliation. (14th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Austria Increases Border Defenses</h3>
<p>Innsbruck: Because of new disputes with the Germans regarding the activities of the National Socialist Party, Austria views Germany's withdrawal from the disarmament conference and the League of Nations as more serious than other European countries. As soon as Vienna received the news from Berlin, it immediately ordered an increase in defenses on the German-Austrian border, apparently because Austrian officials are deeply concerned about conflicts occurring on the border. At present, barbed wire has been newly installed in many key locations, and the National Guard patrols the main roads along the border. Soldiers have also been dispatched to guard the mountain paths and trails that have never been defended before. Travelers crossing the border are strictly inspected, sometimes forced to undress and searched for secret documents. All cars are inspected by mechanics, and empty tires are often disassembled to check for smuggling. (15th, Kokumin)</p>
<h3>Public Opinion in Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) Public opinion around the world continues to comment on the events that occurred in Berlin and Geneva yesterday, all indicating an uneasy picture of world politics. The conclusions drawn from this are extremely inconsistent. However, one point is completely agreed upon by newspapers around the world, namely, that Germany is in complete isolation in international organizations. Although German newspapers have not clearly pointed this out, they also acknowledge it. The comments of various newspapers are summarized below.</p>
<h3>England</h3>
<p>British newspapers raise a question: What attitude should the world adopt towards Germany? The Times advocates signing a disarmament convention to further isolate Germany and, if necessary, resorting to political, economic, and financial sanctions. If Germany continues to expand its armaments (we believe this is inevitable), then short of using force, it is futile for us to force the National Socialist Party government to abandon its established procedures.</p>
<h3>France</h3>
<p>[Le Temps] comments on Germany's attitude towards the League of Nations and the disarmament conference, saying, [For fourteen years, people from all countries have worked tirelessly and with great difficulty to build lasting peace between nations, but the result of their efforts has been swept away by Germany. Germany cannot but bear its responsibility to all of humanity. However, what good is this to Germany? Germany wants to obstruct the conclusion of the disarmament convention, but it must be known that even if the disarmament convention does not succeed, there is still the Treaty of Versailles, and the signatory countries will never allow the provisions of the treaty to be destroyed. Do the people in Berlin know this? Moreover, British Privy Councilor Baldwin's speech to the Birmingham Conservative Party Congress clearly warned Germany. Have the people in Berlin never understood this? Recently, the faith of people around the world in peace-building has been increasing day by day, and their desire for international harmony is strong. Suddenly seeing Germany's actions today, how can they not be filled with grief and anger and think of resisting? The disarmament conference has been frustrated by Germany and has failed, so an arms race will follow, and the danger to humanity will reach its peak, and Germany's harm to the world will be revealed. Only by having people with sincerity work together to seek self-defense can Germany's harm be eliminated. With the international situation changing to this point, I know that the nations of the world will not be able to forgive the German authorities.</p>
<h3>America</h3>
<p>New York seems to view the current situation as more serious than other countries. Some newspapers even believe that armed conflict is possible. What they are most concerned about is what attitude the U.S. government will take towards the various problems in Europe. The *New York Times* and the *New York Evening Post* both say that the U.S. government has decided to do everything in its power to save the disarmament conference. The *New York Times* also said that regardless of whether Germany's rearmament is true or not, the U.S. has already stood on the side of the Allied countries in the last war. Other newspapers advocate adopting a neutral attitude, but there are different opinions on what form this neutrality should take. Officials in Washington claim that the U.S. can choose between strictly adhering to neutrality and passive assistance. The so-called "passive assistance policy" has been explained by President Roosevelt as meaning that neutral countries have the right to normal exchanges with belligerent countries during wartime, which has been generally recognized by the world. The U.S. may abandon these rights. In addition, Washington believes that the German parliamentary re-election will not help the current political situation. The *New York Evening Post* said that the election was a "pathetic farce."</p>
<h3>Italy</h3>
<p>Italian newspapers do not express a clear attitude towards the stance taken by Germany. For example, *Il Popolo d'Italia* said that although Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference is a kind of advancement of the political situation, there is no need to be overly alarmed or fearful. Moreover, such a situation is not without a way out, and the most difficult problems can be solved outside the League of Nations and the disarmament conference. As for the German government's dissolution of the parliament, its benefits are difficult to understand. Other newspapers have similar views. Only *Il Messaggero* has a unique view, saying that Premier Hitler made a solemn guarantee of peace yesterday, which must be paid attention to. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Austria</h3>
<p>Austrian newspapers are unfavorable to German newspapers. They express doubt about the pacifism advocated by Hitler, saying that the German government has been continuously implementing "deceptive policies" towards Austria and cannot be trusted. They also said that this move by Germany is a big mistake, even from the perspective of its own interests. *Neues Wiener Journal* said that since Germany has withdrawn from Geneva, it should be bound by the Treaty of Versailles. *Bundespost* said that "after Germany withdrew from the disarmament conference, other countries are more free." What benefit is there for Germany to isolate itself?</p>
<h3>Poland</h3>
<p>The government newspaper *Gazeta Polska* stated, "Germany slammed the table, causing the Four-Power Pact to suffer a deadly wound." The French Parliament may not approve this treaty under the current circumstances. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Switzerland</h3>
<p>The League of Nations' newspaper *Journal de Genève* responded to the claims made by German newspapers that they hoped to conduct negotiations within the scope of the Four-Power Pact, saying that the Four-Power Pact can only be used within the scope of the League of Nations. Now that Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the Four-Power Pact has died yesterday. *La Tribune de Genève* said, "This sudden event may make the relationship between Britain, France, and the United States closer." In addition, all newspapers said that although the situation is serious, it is clearer than before.</p>
<h3>Germany</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers do not engage in empty talk about the seriousness of the overall situation, but only say that the door is not completely closed yet. The *Berliner Tageblatt* said that Hitler's speech was moderate in tone, so it was very powerful. The *Kreuzzeitung* said that the German people are now of one mind and stand behind the President and the Prime Minister. The *Deutsche Tageszeitung* said that Hitler's speech was the voice of the German people. The *Vossische Zeitung* said that the best part of Hitler's speech was praising French Prime Minister Daladier for his noble idea of fairness, and tens of millions of Germans are very grateful for the remarks made by Daladier in his recent speeches. In short, German newspapers are not as pessimistic as foreign newspapers and hope that Hitler's solemn and pragmatic speech can close the path to final understanding. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Tensions Between Japan and Russia, Washington Closely Watching, U.S. Press Advocates Joint British Action to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department issued a statement due to the increasing tension between Japan and Russia, saying that the U.S. government is only watching. In addition, some people believe that winter is approaching, and Siberia and Manchuria are terribly cold, so if Japan and Russia can avoid conflict within the next four weeks, the chance of their breakup will be greatly reduced. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(New York) The *Sunday Times* reported that European wars are about to happen again. France and Germany still need to go through centuries of conflict. The recurrence of the European war is just another scene in the conflict. "This matter has nothing to do with the United States, and it is not convenient to interfere again, because the United States has the threat of fighting Japan and must prepare for it, and it is especially not appropriate to interfere again. What the United States should do is to conclude an alliance with Britain to prevent Japan and help Australia. When Japan attacks the United States, Britain must at least use its navy to help the United States." (Havas, 14th) (London) The *Observer* said today that disturbances in the Far East have revealed the conflict between Russia and Japan. The dispute over the price of the Chinese Eastern Railway is one of them, but it is not the total cause of the conflict between the two sides. The fact that the rights of the League of Nations do not extend to Russia and Japan is also not important, because Western Europe, where the rights of the League of Nations can extend, is also in a bad state. The newspaper also said that it is no coincidence that Moscow is now trying to be friendly with Poland and France. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Military Expansion</h3>
<p>(London) It was expressed here today that Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference will stimulate Britain's newly rising Conservative Party to increase national defense preparations. Australia and New Zealand have decided to expand naval and air defense. Sheffield steel armor manufacturers are expecting new shipbuilding contracts, and Hoover and other arsenals are also hiring workers. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Trains Student Soldiers as Basic Units for Scientific Warfare, Estimated at Over 734,000 People</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military regards 1935 as the period for foreign wars and is preparing its military, diplomatic, economic, financial, and social countermeasures. It is reported that it has recently paid special attention to weaving student soldiers. The recruitment section of the Army Ministry (responsible for matters related to recruitment offices) has formulated new guidelines to reform the military training methods of various schools. For 1,418 universities and specialized schools across the country, with 734,602 students, strict actual combat training will be carried out. The outline of the guidelines is as follows: (1) Based on battlefield experience, student soldiers are brave in combat and extremely agile in action, and can be compared with active-duty troops. The focus should be on intensifying training with the goal of making them the basic units for the next war. (2) The training methods should focus on small-unit operations, and large-group operations must be added in the future. (3) Train for actual combat, especially focusing on scientific warfare. Student soldiers have high knowledge and are most suitable for the latest scientific warfare. (4) In order to prevent shaking of military morale, in addition to military training, special attention must be paid to ideological education. Therefore, students must have a considerable understanding of national defense, diplomacy, society, and finance based on national policies, so that they can automatically fight for patriotism. (5) Increase special training fees starting from next year. (China United Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>Yin Tong Will Go to Changchun,奉 Huang Fu Orders Negotiation of Various Issues, Li Zeyi Invites Ariyoshi to Go North</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, After Huang Fu, Chairman of the Political Affairs Readjustment Committee, returned to the North, KITA Seichi, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, arrived in Beiping. Huang had several discussions with him on Sino-Japanese issues in North China. However, due to the limited authority of Kita's representation, only some actual matters were briefly discussed, and no decision could be made. Kita has returned to Changchun to report, and although there have been telegrams back and forth, it is still not clear. Huang Fu felt that the various issues were complicated and intricate, and branch negotiations were not easy to break the current difficult situation. Therefore, on the one hand, Yin Tong was sent to Changchun to have an overall contact with the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Hishikari, on various issues. If necessary, he may go to Tokyo. On the other hand, Li Zeyi was sent to Shanghai to urge the Japanese envoy Ariyoshi to go north to discuss everything in detail. Yin and Li left Beiping for Tianjin on the 12th to meet with the commander of the Japanese army, Nakamura, to exchange views. Li then took the Beiping-Pukou train south from Tianjin at 11:00 AM this morning (14th). Yin also left Tianjin for Shanhaiguan this evening (14th) and transferred to Changchun. It is said that he will go to Beiping first, but it is not yet known which is true. It is reported that OKAMURA Yasuji, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, will also arrive in Beiping recently. As for the bandits in Luandong, they are becoming more active. The newly formed security team cannot go east to suppress them. It is said that they are waiting for negotiations from all parties before setting a departure date. Our side, in view of the source of the bandits often coming from outside the pass, plans to first guard all the small passes of the Great Wall to cut off the source of the bandits, and then suppress them severely, in order to eliminate them.

<h3>A Gang of Bandits in Luandong Plans to Invade Changli, A Military Officer from a Certain Country is Arranging it, Changli Traitors are Actually Trying to Lead the Bandits into the City, Li Jichun Sends a Team to Fanning to Suppress the Bandits</h3>
<p>Changli Correspondence, The bandit atmosphere in Luandong is becoming increasingly intense. The following is a summary of the recent situation in Luandong, as reported in yesterday's correspondence. The bandits' plan to flee to Changli is even more urgent than their plan to flee to Fanning, because Changli is the richest county in Luandong and has always been coveted by bandits. Therefore, after the bandits fled to Fanning, they planned to advance westward. The attack on the Northeast Lianggezhuang by the bandits on the 7th of this month was more intense than the battle in Fanning. In this battle, the bandits mobilized their elite troops and tried to make a desperate gamble. However, the security team arrived quickly, which was unexpected by the bandits. More than 200 bandits were killed. Bandit leaders Da Long, Er Long, and Si Haijiao were killed at the same time. After suffering this setback, the bandits became more eager to flee to Changli out of anger. They reorganized their forces and obtained the assistance of a military advisor from a certain country. It is reported that the bandits, in view of the previous failure, listened to the command of the military advisor from a certain country and formulated three plans to attack Changli: (1) Use sailboats to transport a large number of plainclothes bandits, lurking along the coast of Leting, and then transfer to Changli to disturb the rear of the security team; (2) Use money to lure our local self-defense groups to divide our strength and reduce some of our powerful enemies. The first team of the Fanning Defense Regiment, which mutinied earlier, was also bought by the bandits at a price of 20 yuan per person; (3) The bandits were originally a mob. Once on the front line, they would flee in fear. Now they have changed the strategy of attacking in echelons, with elite bandits equipped with broadswords and pistols venturing into the attack. From the above three strategies, the background of the bandits is even clearer. It is reported that Dou Xizhe, the commander of the security team, after learning of the bandits' plan, immediately changed the defense line to resist. However, the current situation in Changli is indeed surrounded by dangers. Although the people's hearts are slightly stable, the danger has not diminished.</p>
<p>Traitors in Changli have been carrying out activities recently. A group of traitorous merchants secretly sent representatives to Qinhuangdao to request Japanese troops to come in to seek temporary peace, and also sent representatives to Qinhuangdao to meet with bandit leader Qi Wenping, saying that the people of Changli welcomed them to enter, but because the security team was stationed in Changli, they dared not openly express their welcome. They also claimed that they had repeatedly wanted to take on the responsibility of providing relief, but were obstructed by the security team. It is reported that a certain Liu, the representative of the traitorous merchants, is still in Qinhuangdao, making various negotiations with Qi Wenping and others. There are two reasons why the traitorous merchants are so unscrupulous: one is to recognize the bandits as their fathers in order to satisfy their own official desires, and the other is to think of using the power of the bandits to protect the safety of their private property. As for the country and the people, they know nothing about it. Recently, they have prepared 10,000 yuan and will take the opportunity to pay tribute to the bandit army. On the 10th of this month, Yamatani, the captain of the Japanese gendarmerie in Qinhuangdao, and Endo, the staff officer of the Suzuki Division, visited Dou Xizhe in Changli as a private visit, and then went to the county government to visit County Magistrate Liang, asking County Magistrate Liang to raise some supplies for the bandits locally. County Magistrate Liang immediately refused. The Japanese claimed that the local people were willing to provide this, so why did the magistrate and the security team leader oppose it? If the bandits attacked Changli, how would the magistrate deal with it? County Magistrate Liang said that he had 30,000 self-defense troops from the people, which were enough to resist the bandits. If they could not hold out, the people of the entire county would rise up together to drive them away. The Japanese then retreated without words. After leaving the county government, they went to the Chamber of Commerce again. The content of the contact is rarely known to the outside world. After having a meal at the Chamber of Commerce at noon, they returned to Qinhuangdao.</p>
<p>The so-called headquarters of the East Asia Alliance United Army is now located north of Daobei in Qinhuangdao. Qi Wenping, the fake commander-in-chief, wears a kimono to work at the headquarters every day. Qi speaks fluent Japanese, and those who do not know him suspect that he is Japanese. When Qi goes out, he is always accompanied by Japanese soldiers. It is reported that their conspiracy to form a North China country is still being planned and realized. According to people from Qinhuangdao, an announcement of "New North China Government of the Republic of China" has been found in the area, and the wording is extremely absurd.</p>
<p>Li Jichun recently sent a team of 2,000 from Tangshan and arrived in Lanzhou by train on the 11th. That night, they went to the suburbs of Fanning in batches to proclaim the suppression of bandits. It is expected that the suppression will begin on the morning of the 13th. It is reported that when the bandit troubles in Luandong first started, Li sent a representative to Tianjin to request the provincial government to order him to suppress the bandits, but it was not approved. However, Li wanted to take this opportunity to make some achievements in order to seek future prospects, as the period for demobilization in the war zone was approaching. Therefore, he sent many representatives to station in various counties in Luandong to contact local officials, claiming that if there were occasional incidents in various places, he was willing to send a team to assist. Recently, the bandit troubles in Luandong have become more rampant, and he is even more determined to suppress them. Therefore, the provincial government granted his request. He is also willing to take responsibility for recovering Fanning. After our newly formed security team arrived, they went to Liushouying on the Beining Road to carry out the suppression of the bandits on the southern route. If the two routes attack at the same time, the bandits in Luandong will not be difficult to eliminate. I do not know whether Li has the sincerity to suppress the bandits or not. (12th)</p>
<h3>Chen Diaoyuan Arrives in Nanchang—Zhang Qun and Others Ascend Mount Lu from Xunyang—</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Chen Diaoyuan, the Chief Commander of the First Route Army, arrived in the province from Nanjing on the 8th, accompanied by more than twenty people including staff officers, adjutants, code clerks, and soldiers. He stayed at the provincial government's guest house. Immediately, he went to Chiang Kai-shek's residence to meet with Chiang, reporting on the defense of the Qingjiangpu area, the organization of the militia, and the training of his troops. They also discussed the suppression of the Red Army in the Gan-East and Anhui border areas, as the troops stationed there are under Chen's command. It is said that Chen is scheduled to go to Xunyang on the 13th or 14th, then proceed to LePing and Fuliang to inspect the troops of Ruan Zhaolu's division. This division has been in Gan-East for several years, assisting in the suppression of bandits such as Fang Shao in the Changjiang River basin. Therefore, he is making a special trip to inspect and instruct them for reorganization.</p>
<p>Zhang Qun, Chairman of Hubei Provincial Government, and various Central Committee members, have successively passed through Xunyang and ascended Mount Lu. It is said that they will be discussing important political affairs at Mount Lu. (October 12th)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Tobacco Smugglers in Fuzhou Open Fire and Wound Our Police—Arrested Ronin Reclaimed by Japanese Consulate</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Fujian Province is separated from Taiwan by only a narrow strip of water, a mere two-day journey. Consequently, unemployed vagrants from Taiwan flock to Fujian to make a living, with the largest numbers concentrated in the coastal areas of Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Quanzhou. It is estimated that there are already over a thousand Taiwanese in Fuzhou alone, all engaged in running opium dens and "tu-xing" (local products) businesses. According to investigations by the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, within the police district alone, there are over three hundred Japanese-run foreign-brand liquor stores and over forty "tu-xing" businesses. Moreover, the Taiwanese Association has selected over two hundred strong and fierce ruffians and formed a "Taiwanese Overseas Chinese Volunteer Corps," issued with handguns by the consulate, to be solely responsible for protection. When our government officials wish to search these establishments, they must notify the consulate and dispatch Japanese police to accompany them. Otherwise, they will open fire to resist arrest. Even if criminals are apprehended, they must be handed over to the Japanese police for interrogation and trial. Our government officials are not allowed to intervene. These foreign-brand opium dens have become places that harbor dirt and accept filth. All thieves gather within.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>They are planning and conspiring, thus not only undermining the opium ban but also disrupting public order. Our government officials have no power to intervene, so nothing can be done. The Taiwanese have become increasingly reckless. On the evening of October 7th, the detective team of the Public Security Bureau received a tip that someone was smuggling a large quantity of opium to Liangtai Dexing Lane. They dispatched several detectives to investigate and arrested one unidentified person with three large packages of opium. As they were about to take him back to the station, suddenly more than thirty Taiwanese thugs, each armed with handguns, iron bars, and knives, surrounded the detectives, intending to seize both the person and the goods. The detectives resisted but were overpowered and everything was taken away. Fortunately, the inspection team of the Public Security Bureau stationed nearby on Tiantang Street heard the news and rushed to rescue them, arriving at Dexing Lane. They joined the detectives in a vigorous pursuit. Unexpectedly, the thugs, seeing people chasing from behind, opened fire. The inspection team also returned fire. For a moment, stray bullets flew everywhere, causing great panic among the merchants and residents, who all closed their doors. The chaos lasted for about half an hour before the thugs were repelled. Six perpetrators were arrested on the spot. However, four of our inspectors and detectives were also wounded. The inspection team escorted the criminals to the Public Security Bureau. One of them, Li Caiwang, was an employee of the Japanese Consulate. On the 8th, the Japanese Consul sent a letter requesting extradition. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, considering that the Taiwanese had not only smuggled opium but also opened fire and wounded our police, which was extremely illegal, only handed over Li Caiwang for repatriation. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, the Japanese Consul Moriya, accompanied by Police Chief Zhongshan and Ke Baoluo, representatives of the Taiwanese Association, visited Qiu Zhaochen, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the other five people also be handed over to them for repatriation. Negotiations lasted until 2:00 PM. The Japanese Consul agreed to the conditions proposed by our side: (1) compensation for all losses of the wounded police; (2) severe punishment of the ronin who opened fire and robbed; (3) prohibition of the "Volunteer Corps" organization which disrupts public order. Therefore, the five Taiwanese were handed over to them for interrogation and trial. (October 11th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guizhou Assist Each Other to Expand Strength: Wang Jialie Purchases Weapons from Guangdong; Chen Jitang Recruits Soldiers from Guizhou; War in Guizhou is Imminent</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Messengers from the provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Guangdong are constantly traveling back and forth. Chen Jitang of Guangdong Province previously dispatched Mai Huanzhang, Gan Jiayi, and Dan Lianxin to Guizhou to negotiate important matters on behalf of the Southwest Political Council. It is now learned that Mai and others returned to Guangdong via Guizhou on the 1st of this month, passing through Guangxi Province eastward. They are expected to arrive in Guangzhou around the middle of this month.</p>
<p>Guizhou Province is located in a remote western area, with inconvenient transportation. There is a great shortage of military supplies. Wang Jialie, the Chairman of the province, recently purchased a large batch of guns and artillery from Guangdong, including dozens of rapid-firing guns and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. These have already been transported from Guangdong, transiting through Guangxi to Guizhou. Recently, Wang felt that the purchased artillery and guns were still insufficient. Yesterday, he telegraphed Chen Jitang again, requesting the purchase of 200 Type 79 light machine guns and 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Guangdong. This has been agreed to here and will be shipped to Guiyang shortly. Wang has entrusted Guangdong with purchasing military supplies. Chen Jitang, recently needing new soldiers to replenish his armies, finds recruitment within Guangdong difficult. Therefore, he has entrusted Wang Jialie with recruiting two regiments of new soldiers (approximately 3,000 men) in Guizhou. It is now learned that these new soldiers have already been recruited and have been dispatched from Guiyang through Guangxi, passing through Hechi, and arriving in Liuzhou. They will travel to Wuzhou along the Guiping Road and then take civilian boats to Guangdong. They are expected to arrive around the middle of this month. Chen Jitang, upon receiving the news, dispatched Tang, the captain of the 12th Gendarmerie Team, with the entire team of gendarmes to Wuzhou on the 5th of this month to prepare to receive the new soldiers arriving in the province. In addition to recruiting several thousand soldiers for Chen Jitang, Wang has also selected 24 fine horses in Guizhou and sent several adjutants to escort them to Guangdong for Chen Jitang to receive. Chen completed the inspection and receipt on the 4th.</p>
<p>Internal wars in Guizhou are frequent. According to military news, the Guizhou army units of Jiang Zaizhen and Che Mingyi have returned to Guizhou from the Sichuan border. You Guocai's unit has also returned to Guizhou from Yunnan and set up a command post in Panjiang. You and others have jointly issued a telegram denouncing Wang Jialie. War in Guizhou is once again on the verge of breaking out. However, Wang Jialie's side sent a telegram to Guangdong on the 1st of this month, claiming to maintain peace. Wang's telegram stated, "Guizhou Province has suffered repeated military conflicts, leading to poverty and exhaustion of the people, coupled with drought, creating a desolate scene. Since returning to the province, I, Jialie, have felt remorse and, in addition to self-reproach, have spared no effort to compromise and concede to achieve peace, aiming to embody the national spirit of unity and save the country, desiring our people to breathe and recover. Therefore, I have fully accepted consultations with neighboring provinces. Messengers travel constantly. I have used every means possible to accommodate and conciliate You Guocai, repeatedly ceding the eight counties of Panjiang and requesting Peng Gongwu, Tan Xun, and Tao, among others, to wait for negotiations in Yunnan. I have also welcomed the Yunnan representative Dan Nugang and You's representative Liao Yinxiang to the province, discussing in detail several times, deciding to entrust the position of overall clearing and suppressing commander of the province. All this has factual proof and is known to people inside and outside the province. Unexpectedly, You recently sent telegrams to his representatives Deng Mingjie and Dong Jiangzhen, stating, on one hand, that 'previously, the troops crossed the river, originally intending to advance on three routes and restore the original defense. Unfortunately, Jiang and Che suffered defeats, so we stopped at the brink of disaster with the mediation of Yunnan Chairman Long Yun.' On the other hand, he stated that 'Liao Yinxiang's visit to the province was not entrusted with a task, but merely to engage in some dealings to ease the situation.' Finally, he fabricated facts and made false accusations, which have been published in various newspapers, causing people inside and outside the province to sigh and feel alarmed. I reflect again that due to my lack of virtue, sincerity has not been established, and persuasion has been ineffective. However, the will for peace will never change because of this. I vow to persevere in pacifying matters and ensuring tranquility. In addition to telegraphing Chairman Long to continue to take responsibility for mediation and retaining Dan and Liao, among others, for long-term consultations in order to avoid internal strife, I am especially telegraphing this to you for your attention." Considering Wang Jialie's telegram, while Wang Jialie is indeed talking about vigorously maintaining peace, he is also actively purchasing guns and artillery. Meanwhile, You Guocai and others have repeatedly telegraphed, denouncing Wang's misgovernment and claiming to petition for the people. With both sides going to extremes, it is feared that war in Guizhou cannot be eliminated by words and writings alone. (October 8th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Promulgates Guidelines for Civil Disputes in Bandit Areas—Special Emphasis on Protecting Farmers' Interests—</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: In the suppression of the Red Army in five provinces, the 19th Route Army of the Eastern Route has driven the Zhu-Mao pseudo-First Front Army out of JiangLe and Shaowu. The 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th Army Corps in Jiangxi are continuously attacking Lichuan, Nancheng, and Nanfeng. They are being intercepted by this Route Army. Fierce battles are breaking out east of Lichuan, Xiaoshi, and Xinfeng Street, close to the Fujian border. The National Army units of Zhou Wei, Zhou Hunyuan, Yao Chun, Wu Qiwai, and Xu Kexiang are exceptionally brave and have been fighting bloody battles with the bandits for four days, killing many bandits. Nancheng is still in the midst of a fierce battle. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, considering that the bandit areas will soon be recovered, has promulgated five articles of the "Guidelines for Handling Civil Disputes in Recovered Bandit Areas" in the five provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei to adapt to the special circumstances. Among them, special emphasis is placed on not blaming the past and protecting the interests of farmers to stabilize society. The articles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In handling civil disputes in various counties within the bandit suppression area, in addition to complying as much as possible with the current civil law, these guidelines may be applied. (2) When applying these guidelines, the principles of the current civil law should still be adopted as much as possible. However, if the situation has changed after the bandit rebellion, appropriate relief methods should be taken between the severity and urgency of the situation to achieve appropriate treatment. (3) These guidelines emphasize the protection of farmers' interests. The following methods will be used for all actions by farmers under duress from bandits:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding land and other real estate, disputes over boundaries or ownership arising after the bandit rebellion shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Chapters One and Three of the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in the Bandit Suppression Areas" in the provinces and Article 12 of the "Regulations on Military Colonization." (B) Regarding rental disputes over farmland resumed after the bandit rebellion, the handling procedures and methods shall comply with the provisions of Chapter Five of the "Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land." (C) Regarding farmer debt disputes after the bandit rebellion, the handling procedures and methods shall comply with the provisions of Chapter Seven of the "Regulations on Rural Land." The foregoing methods may also be applied to other displaced people in the bandit area who have newly returned. (4) All behaviors of the people other than those in the previous articles that violate the law were not originally intentional. If there are marriage matters, pledge matters, joint property matters, and all other personal matters and various problems that are driven by circumstances, resulting in a loss of normalcy, they should be handled with humanity and leniency as much as possible, within the possible scope of fact and law, and plans should be made for handling. (5) These guidelines shall not apply to bandit areas that have been recovered for more than one year and have not been changed, except that the Regulations on Rural Land Handling may still be consulted.

<h3>Verdict in the Wuchang Gold Digging Case: Peng Younan Found Guilty of Property Damage; Proceeds of the Theft Confiscated</h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The case of Peng Younan, a neighbor, stealing gold from Kong Geng's house in Wuchang on May 30th, was reported by Kong as property damage and theft. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters ordered the entire committee of the Wuchang Construction Watchtower, together with the Wuchang Lawyers Association, to organize a Gold Digging Investigation Committee to be responsible for investigation and trial. This lasted three months. Because the volume of the gold cellar was quite large, the types of gold and the amount involved could not be accurately determined. Despite offering a reward, no one came forward with evidence. It was legally difficult to make a rash judgment. Under the supervision of the police department, the Investigation Committee convened the parties involved and witnesses on August 26th for a final public debate. It was determined that Peng Younan was indeed highly suspected of committing theft and property damage. Peng Shi-sun was also not without collusion in providing false evidence and conspiring to conceal stolen goods. It was resolved to send them to the Police Department's Military Law Office for detention. After the two Pengs were imprisoned, on the 14th of this month, the Police Department's Military Law Office formally announced the verdict. The principal offender, Peng Younan, damaged another person's property and was sentenced to one month of detention. The number of days of detention before the verdict was allowed to be offset by two days for each day of detention. Due to the crime of property damage, the proceeds of the theft, 24,500 yuan in silver dollars (the amount that Peng Younan was willing to pay as a fine), were confiscated and handed over to the Construction Committee of the Watchtower for use as construction funds. The theft portion could not be established because it did not meet the legal conditions. Peng Shi-sun was found not guilty. After the verdict, Peng Younan was returned to custody, and Peng Shi-sun was released. The case was thus concluded. The police authorities issued a statement on the same day, stating that [the Wuchang gold digging case, after the Investigation Committee reported the results of the investigation, along with their opinions, to the headquarters, the headquarters reviewed and verified the facts and could only make a judgment according to law. However, after the judgment, if anyone has new and reliable evidence regarding the quality, quantity, and detailed amount of gold that Peng has unearthed, they can still report to the headquarters in detail through the proper procedures of the previous announcement method, so that the headquarters can fully pursue and obtain it for the public good].

<h3>Inspection Report on Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei by Our Special Correspondent Ren An: Miscellaneous News from Lianhua After the Robbery (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Due to the National Army's adoption of a scorched-earth policy, advancing and firmly defending each captured location, the bandit forces in Lianhua County, facing a lack of military supplies and economic exhaustion, have been forced to retreat to dangerous locations in hopes of surviving. The pseudo-17th and 18th Divisions, recently gathered at the Meihuashan mountain ridge on the border of Chaling, attempted to lure the main force of the National Army away in mid-September, staging their so-called counter-offensive, hiding their main force in the deep mountains and dense forests of the Wangfo'an Xiaotian area. First, they sent a portion of the bandits to besiege the National Army's Xianling position, launching several fierce assaults. The National Army calmly responded and did not pursue. Several planes also conducted reconnaissance and bombing, but the bandits were unsuccessful and retreated under cover of night. Small-scale skirmishes between the pseudo-Red Guards, guerrillas, and anti-communist volunteer corps or the National Army's clearing and suppression teams are common within twenty miles of the city. Nancun, fifteen miles west of the city, was only recovered a few days ago. The reporter rushed to visit the village and saw two bloody wounded soldiers being carried back from the front lines. Soon after, a battalion commander named Guo also led his troops and said, "We fought with the bandits on the hillside about three miles from here. We knew that the bandits had about a hundred rifles, so we only led two platoons to clear and suppress the area. Unexpectedly, a new bandit force of over a hundred men and rifles had been transferred from Pingxiang, resulting in a great disparity in numbers. If we had not retreated quickly, we would have suffered a great loss." In addition to the aforementioned pseudo-17th and 18th Divisions, each with four or five thousand men and rifles, the current bandit forces in Lianhua also include various miscellaneous organizations such as the Red Guard, Political Security Team, and District Guerrilla, totaling about two hundred rifles. Their movements are unpredictable. Encounters like the one experienced by Battalion Commander Guo occur several times a day throughout the county, but they are all small-scale skirmishes with no major victories or defeats.</p>
<p>The trip to Nancun can also be considered an inspection of the front lines. The village is located in the mountains with a clear stream that can irrigate good farmland. The late rice is already laden with ears, growing lushly and deeply, so high that people can be lost in it. This shows that the fields in the bandit area are not as barren as those in the red-white transition zone. The stationed troops are rushing to build bunkers on the hilltop, and the villagers are helping them. At dusk, they all close their doors and live in seclusion. They are also unwilling to come out when they hear the alarm because they still harbor a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, it is not convenient to carry out a thorough household registration and Baojia system. It is also difficult for the district office and volunteer corps personnel to patrol outdoors at night because the pseudo-county Soviet government is located in Miaoxia Village, only five miles away. To prevent bandit night attacks, they can only close their doors and guard themselves. The volunteer corps sells salt and kerosene to users for a fixed price. Each person is allowed to purchase three coins' worth of salt per day. A cloth-made license with a seal is required for purchasing. On the day in question, the volunteer corps had not gone to the city to purchase salt, so there was no salt to sell. Those who came to purchase were disappointed and returned, saying that the suffering of not having salt to eat was greater than not having oil to light lamps. The bandits divided the fields in the village twice. The first time, the area of the fields was used as a standard, with each person receiving about two dou (about two or three mu). The second time, the yield was used as a standard: four shi for high-quality fields, three shi for medium-quality fields, and two shi for low-quality fields, with each person receiving fields that could harvest seven shi of grain. Each shi weighs one hundred jin. A progressive tax of 6% should be paid, totaling 42 jin of grain. (Those who originally had eight shi of grain should pay a progressive tax of 7%, and so on. However, no one is allowed to receive more than fifteen shi, and in reality, no one has ever been heard of receiving more than ten shi). Each shi is priced at 4,000 wen based on the current market price. Hired farmers and poor farmers can pay the tax entirely in grain, while middle farmers can pay half in grain and half in cash, or choose as they please. Rich farmers must pay entirely in cash, and sometimes the price is raised to 6,000 wen per shi.</p>
<p>The items most affected by the blockade in the bandit area are salt and cloth. Even at high prices, they are not easily obtained. Last year, the bandits also implemented a blockade policy, prohibiting the export of rice, tea oil, metals, coal, wood, and other items. Later, seeing that glutinous rice could be used to brew wine and fetch a good price in non-bandit areas, they lifted the ban. Subsequently, tea oil, coal, and other items were also gradually allowed to be exported. When purchasing industrial products and daily necessities from outside, the cooperatives often handled it, exchanging the agricultural products of the bandit area for them. They rarely used cash unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The bandits have occupied Lianhua County for many years, only paving a stone road in the city and building a dam in a certain area to develop water conservancy. An investigation after the city's recovery found that the bandits had established thirteen Lenin Elementary Schools. The word "Lenin" in the name of the Lenin Elementary Schools has been completely removed. It is said that formal elementary schools will be gradually established or children's anti-communist groups will be reorganized to implement special education. The stone road will be retained to facilitate transportation. The dam built in a certain village upstream, according to the refugees (mostly landlords and wealthy gentry) who had fled and returned home, harmed the feng shui, and they repeatedly petitioned the county government to demolish it. Their request was not approved, probably because they feared that countless fertile fields upstream would be turned into truly red land.</p>
<p>The people who have been banditized seem to have three characteristics. The first is fearlessness. During the previous National Army's suppression campaigns, they would flee dozens of miles away whenever the army arrived in an area, and few dared to risk returning. Now, they only flee slightly outside the village, and upon learning that the National Army is tolerant, they immediately return together. Some even dare to cross the heavy encirclement to seek revenge and take the heads of newly returned refugees. Villagers in Wutang were killed by the dozen for cutting electric wires as a warning, but they were still unafraid. They even took advantage of the retreat of a certain company to confiscate their guns with farm tools, resulting in a bloody massacre. Previously, they experienced a rice shortage and sent villagers to the bandit area to purchase grain, successfully attracting friends and relatives and helping to build bunkers in the rain of bullets, all without fear. Their courage is evident in this way. The second is cruelty. Killing is not considered a big deal, and there are countless examples. The third is creativity. Regarding positions such as the captain of the volunteer corps and other important positions in groups, the farmers dared to compete with the refugees. After winning the positions, they were often able to be innovative in their duties and handle them with ease. If they failed to compete, they would turn into troublemakers, making things difficult for those in charge.</p>
<p>The bandit army paid close attention to the training of the people, especially the organization and training of children, which was very rigorous and serious. The eleven-character slogan of the children's group was [Prepare, prepare at all times]. A careful examination of it can reveal its profound meaning. The reporter once spoke with children who had joined the children's group. First, their answers were very fluent, especially regarding the significance of memorial days such as May 1st, May 9th, September 18th, and January 28th, they answered fluently without hesitation. When using terms such as "dividing calendars for several years," "imperialism," and "bourgeoisie," they were even more familiar with them. The textbooks used in Lenin Elementary Schools only had three subjects in the lower grades: national language, singing, and physical education. The upper grades are unknown. There was no fixed time limit, and they were promoted or demoted according to their grades. The Commissioner's Office has organized the children in the city who have been educated by the bandits into anti-communist children's groups and provided them with special education. They have also been assigned to check and fill out forms for residents' household registration and occupation, among other things. Because they speak clearly, work hard, and achieve results above adults,</p>
<p>Statistics show that there are 265 shops in Liancheng, with the fewest being pharmacies, only seven, but their business is quite good. The most numerous are cigarette shops, with 105, indicating the large number of Lianmin who have a smoking habit. The officers and soldiers of the entire 63rd Division stationed there, as well as all the staff of the Commissioner's Office and the county government, have all quit smoking cigarettes to promote the anti-smoking campaign. Since September 1st, the import of cigarettes has been strictly prohibited to eliminate the bad habits of the people. Most of the tobacco leaves, tin foil, and cardboard used for cigarettes are imported, and many of the manufacturing companies are run by foreign merchants. By advocating a hundred effects and prohibiting them, it is not only of great benefit to national health.</p>

<h3>Factional Disputes in the Women's Association</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Women's Association was initially initiated by Chen Suwu and others, and then by Kong Meizhi and others. After mediation by the county party headquarters, they merged and organized. However, internal factional disputes were fierce and uncompromising until now, when they barely managed to complete the organization. It was scheduled to elect cadres yesterday (15th) afternoon and hold an inaugural meeting today (16th). Unexpectedly, when the membership meeting was held yesterday, the number of members present was insufficient to meet the quorum. Although instructor Chen Qian tried his best to rally them, it was unsuccessful and the meeting had to be declared adjourned. It is feared that it will be difficult to establish it in the near future.</p>
<h3>Confiscation of Weights and Measures Leads to Market Strike</h3>
<p>In the East Gate of Wujiang County, a market strike occurred on the previous day (14th) due to the inspection of weights and measures. According to investigations, a weights and measures inspector named Ni Jingfu, together with the county chamber of commerce and the Public Security Bureau, sent personnel to conduct inspections on that day. Initially, order was good in the city. However, when they reached Shengjiaku, they discovered old weights and measures on the winter vegetable stalls, which were taken away. Unexpectedly, the stallholders snatched them back and broke them, leading to a misunderstanding. All the shops went on strike in solidarity. Later, the county chamber of commerce, the county government, and the Public Security Bureau came forward to persuade them, and they resumed business as usual.</p>

<h3>Barbers Have Resumed Work</h3>
<p>The Laomeirongxuan Barber Shop and the Meihua Barber Shop outside Guangfu Gate on Hanchang Road, without the approval of their peers, lowered prices to attract customers, which led to opposition from the industry's workers. They all went on strike and smashed the goods and property of the Laomeirongxuan and Meihua barber shops. The Second Branch Bureau arrested Zhang Rongfu and 12 others and sent them to the General Bureau for interrogation and detention. Their actions had been misguided. It is learned that after this incident, the Barber Industry Association Zhou Shaoqin and others specifically presented a petition to the county government requesting the release of the arrested workers and requesting the maintenance of industry regulations. Over two hundred striking workers also held a meeting at the Bayierzhaohui to discuss ways to rescue the arrested workers. Tan Jinchun, Shen Deshan, Zhang Yusheng, Wu Aisheng, and four others were elected as representatives to lead over a hundred workers, holding flags, to petition the county party headquarters. Mao, the training officer of the headquarters, received them and agreed to forward the petition to the committee for review. They then petitioned the county government, where County Magistrate Yan received them personally. The representatives presented their petition and personally delivered the petition, requesting relief. Magistrate Yan gave them earnest advice, ordering them to resume work first to avoid losses. The arrested workers, except for those who had indeed engaged in destructive actions, should be detained for investigation, and the rest, if no major relationship was found, should be released on bail. Sha Licai and Liu Dabai were found to have violated industry regulations by lowering prices without authorization, which was improper. The Public Security Bureau was ordered to order them to restore the original price and not to disobey. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed. The arrested workers were tried in court by Section Chief Wu of the Public Security Bureau. As a result, eight people including Zhang Jidong were released on bail because they were unrelated. Zhang Rongfu and five others were found to have engaged in destructive actions and were ordered to be returned to custody. Yesterday (15th) morning at around 7:00, the barber shops inside and outside the city, in order to avoid unnecessary losses, resumed business first. However, the workers' side, because five workers were not allowed to be released, insisted on continuing the strike to show their determination. The county party headquarters and the county government, fearing that unscrupulous people would take the opportunity to cause trouble, in addition to ordering public security agencies to strictly guard against it, also sent responsible personnel to persuade the barber workers to resume work that day and wait for the official authorities to handle it fairly. By noon at 12:00, all the barber shops had resumed business and were operating as usual.</p>
<h3>Night Sailing Boat Robbed in Panfeng</h3>
<p>A night sailing boat owned by Feng Heyuan, which regularly travels from this county to Huangshan Bridge in Changzhou County, was robbed. On the evening of the day before yesterday, at 8 PM, while sailing from Wuxi to Changzhou as usual, the boat was passing the mulberry fields on the shore of Panfeng in this county when suddenly seven bandits armed with flashlights and pistols emerged. They seized the two crew members who were pulling the boat from the shore, forced them to pull the boat closer to the bank, jumped aboard, silenced everyone, and looted at will. After about half an hour, they left with their stolen goods. Afterwards, the boat owner, Feng Heyuan, inspected his losses and found that tin foil, foreign yarn, cloth, fruit, clothing, etc., worth over three hundred yuan, had been stolen. Currently, Feng Heyuan has reported the robbery to the shipping industry association, which has forwarded it to the county government, requesting the arrest of the thieves and the recovery of the stolen goods.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Police Come to Cheng to Arrest Runaway Wife</h3>
<p>Yu Wenlin, a box and brush maker from 7 Jishan Street, Nanshi, Shanghai, had a wife named Sun, who was enticed away by Liu Laigen (who worked in the same factory) from Yejimiao, Waihu Bridge, Chengxi. Liu took Sun and three to four thousand yuan worth of clothing and jewelry to Cheng, lodging in the Su residence in Chayuan Alley, West Main Street. Yu Wenlin reported this to the First Police Station of the Second District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. They arrested Liu Laigen and sent police officers to Cheng on the 13th to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau's detective team in arresting Sun. However, she had already heard the news and fled.</p>

<h3>Flood Victims Along the River Appeal for Dyke Repair</h3>
<p>The dike along the Yangtze River in the Langshan District of Nantong was breached by river tides, causing a disastrous flood. The breach has not yet been repaired. Currently, the dikes of Baizhang and other areas are being severely eroded and are in danger of collapsing into the river at any moment. The flood victims are now appealing to the county government to quickly purchase firewood and stones and rush to carry out emergency repair work to protect against the river tides.</p>

<h3>Burglary Occurs in Yangmu Township</h3>
<p>Liu Qingyun, a resident of Yangmu Township in the urban area, is a well-to-do owner of a general store. The night before last, eight bandits speaking with mixed accents, dressed in short clothes, and armed with flashlights and box cannons, scaled the wall and entered his house. They first tied up the store staff and family members, then rummaged through boxes and chests. At that moment, the rope binding Liu suddenly loosened, and he took the opportunity to escape and shout for help. The bandits, realizing they could not stay long, howled and fled. Afterwards, an inspection revealed that over two hundred yuan in cash, seven taels of gold jewelry, and a pair of pearl hairpins were missing. The incident has already been reported to the district office for investigation and pursuit.</p>

<h3>Shop Assistants in Six Trades Oppose the Expansion of the Dasheng Incident</h3>
<p>In Yangzhou City, six trades including silk, cloth, Western clothing, and Gu embroidery are opposing the business dispute of Dasheng Silk Bureau. Labor and management have been on strike and the market has been closed for three days. As the incident expands, repeated mediation has failed. Dasheng Silk Bureau has scheduled its reopening for the 14th. Upon hearing this news, hundreds of shop assistants from the six trades formed a team at dawn, lined up in front of Dasheng’s gate, each holding small flags and distributing hunger strike declarations. This prevented Dasheng from reopening. At one point, thousands of onlookers gathered. The Public Security Bureau and the county chamber of commerce sent dozens of police and business group members to stand guard in front of Dasheng's gate, alongside the six trades, to provide assistance. They organized a comfort team for the six trades, providing them with steamed buns to satisfy their hunger. Wang Lu, a representative from the provincial party headquarters, arrived in Yangzhou to investigate the dispute and, together with County Magistrate Ma, Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang, and Lawyers Association Dai Tianqiu, went to Dasheng at 2 PM to persuade the bureau to postpone its reopening. They also persuaded the shop assistants from the six trades to disperse and await a meeting of all relevant parties to be convened tomorrow (the 15th) to discuss a proper solution. Both sides accepted the proposal, and the shops dispersed.</p>

The exhibition period was originally set for three weeks, but was extended by ten days at the request of various sectors, totaling one month. During this month, although we dare not say that the results are excellent, we have certainly been able to move a portion of the public. Since the opening, over tens of thousands of compatriots have come to visit, showing that they have already felt the interest in promoting national products. Today is the day of the closing announcement. The significance of today's closing is not only an end, but also a further step in the promotion. We hope that all Shanghai citizens and manufacturers will unite to help in a permanent and unlimited way. The review committee for this National Products Exhibition has completed its review, and there are many special products that can certainly represent the glory of the results of the efforts of this association and various manufacturers."</p>
<p>Finally, he hoped that the citizens would make efforts to move forward, etc. Then, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Ye Jiaxing and Chinese Taxpayers' Association Tao Leqin gave speeches successively. Hu Fengxiang then replied.</p>

<h3>Closing Declaration</h3>
<p>The association issued the following closing declaration yesterday: "In the autumn when inland capital is concentrated in Shanghai and mostly invested in mud and paper, with the inland having no porridge to eat and Shanghai having many foreign houses, factories continuing to open and banks opening one after another, this National Products Exhibition's desire to promote the purchase and use of national products is naturally like ants carrying heavy loads. Unexpectedly, what we thought was an action like a rural opera performance was able to invite the enthusiastic support of Shanghai citizens, and the results should also be considerable. What can be reported, and what is considered worthy of reporting, is that the participating compatriots are indeed the kind who can truly purchase and use national products. It is hoped that all citizens will continue to work hard, and ultimately reach the conclusion of the opening declaration: Chinese people should only sell national products, selling foreign products should only be done by foreigners."</p>
<h3>Recreational Entertainment</h3>

<h3>Economic Expert Xu Peikun Discusses the Issue of Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>The term "controlled economy" has been very popular recently, echoing the emergence of various new terms in the past, with different approaches but similar results. After a considerable period of time, the people who advocated them all disappeared without a trace. In reality, of course, there were no results. This phenomenon can be said to be our country's unique common problem. Whenever we want to start something, everyone is excited and enthusiastic, but when it comes to the point where there is no way to do it, needless to say, we just muddle through. Now, the whole country is happily advocating a controlled economy, and the people of the whole country naturally hope that this thing will succeed, so that after the controlled economy is realized, industry and commerce can develop greatly and the government will have the power to solve the problem of people's livelihood. What is frightening is that we may repeat the same mistakes, as if we only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs but don't see anyone coming down. Speaking of the term "controlled economy," it is new in writing, so it has aroused the interest of scholars, but it is actually an old term. Whether in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad, it can be boldly said that no country has not implemented a controlled economy. During the European War, the countries that participated in the war absolutely controlled all aspects of production, consumption, and distribution by the government. Even eating a piece of bread or buying a pound of rice had to be approved by the government. The current Soviet Russia, of course, adopts this method. Other countries also have many examples of control in peacetime. Banks, railways, exchanges, and all large enterprises are subject to government control and restrictions. Our country's advocacy of a controlled economy seems like a recent thing on the surface, but in reality, our country is an old hand at implementing a controlled economy. Since ancient times, the establishment of pawnshops, barbershops, teahouses, tofu shops, and other shops has been subject to the strict constraints of the government and the industry association. There must be a considerable distance between them on a street before they are allowed to open. The transportation and sale of rice, salt, and other consumer goods are also subject to strict supervision by the government. The opium problem is also within the same scope of prohibition. Sometimes the government also interferes with the entry and exit of copper coins. From this, it can be seen that the controlled economy is an old hand talking about everyday matters. The reason why this issue is being enthusiastically advocated today is probably because the problems of rice, wheat, cotton, etc., are too important, so we have paid attention to the issue of control. However, there have been several discussions on the problems of rice, wheat, cotton, etc., which all included the meaning of control. In summary, the method of controlled economy is not new, and all countries have it. What we should pay attention to is what the result will be after the implementation of the controlled economy. The meaning and responsibility of a controlled economy A controlled economy is an old method, as I said last time, but its scope and meaning depend on the size and nature of the enterprise. In simple terms, its meaning and responsibility are to make production, consumption, and distribution regular, so that people can get what they need, support themselves, stabilize social order, and make people live and work in peace. However, to achieve this goal and solve the problem of people's livelihood, we must first develop production, which requires everyone to have a job and receive considerable remuneration so that consumption can be smooth and distribution can be balanced. In this way, the controlled economy bears the mission of solving the entire problem of people's livelihood, which is certainly the most difficult thing. The Premier, in his Industrial Plan, stipulated that large enterprises should be state-owned and small enterprises should be privately owned, and also stipulated the method of equalizing land ownership, which are all problems of controlled economy, but when it comes to implementation, we feel many difficulties. The conditions for implementing a controlled economy A controlled economy bears the responsibility of solving the problem of people's livelihood, and its importance can be imagined. A controlled economy is an old method, but the result of its implementation is often contrary to expectations, and the difficulty of implementing control is also clear. The failure of modern industry and commerce to develop and the fact that the national economy is in a desperate situation clearly prove that our country has no unified method and urgently needs to find an overall control strategy that encompasses everything. However, this strategy is originally a very easy thing when it is just a paper talk, but in reality, it is a very difficult thing to do it step by step, so that it can play a role, have an effect, and consistently reach the destination. In simple terms, if we want the controlled economy to produce effective results, we must first have all kinds of conditions. However, these conditions are very difficult to present in full, because there are many gaps between words and facts, which cannot be expressed. Now, I will list seven conditions for reference: (1) Correct facts; (2) Proper theoretical basis; (3) Thorough economic and commercial knowledge; (4) Experienced professionals in various industries; (5) Talents with enterprise design and management; (6) Talents for implementation; (7) Sufficient economic power.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Yuxiu, an Overseas Chinese in Batavia, Discusses the General Situation of Domestic Goods in Nanyang: Six Major Reasons for the Sluggish Sales of Domestic Goods, and Hopes That Domestic Goods Merchants Will Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate whether domestic goods are suitable for sale in Nanyang, Mr. Chen Baipeng, a Chinese businessman in Batavia, Nanyang, specially sent Mr. Chen Yuxiu to Shanghai. A reporter from the New Voice Society interviewed him yesterday at his residence and recorded the following conversation to inform those who are concerned about Nanyang trade. The reporter asked, "I heard that overseas Chinese in Nanyang are affected by the global economic downturn, and their economies are declining. What is the current situation?" Mr. Chen replied, "The decline of Chinese businesses in the Dutch East Indies is due to the instability of their economic foundation. Although some people say that the reason for this instability is the lack of large enterprises such as banks, I believe that the reason for the failure of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is that the position they occupy in commerce is not healthy. Because overseas Chinese are all intermediaries, they sell manufactured goods to consumers (natives) and sell raw materials from producers (natives) to capitalists. Now, the level of knowledge of the natives has increased, and capitalists have become more emotionally connected due to their long-term association with the natives, so all transactions are directly sold without the need for overseas Chinese as intermediaries. This is the reason for the decline of overseas Chinese. If we want to save overseas Chinese in the future, the only way is to make overseas Chinese merchants selling domestic goods, rather than intermediaries who specialize in buying and selling goods for foreign capitalists. Only then will the commercial power of overseas Chinese have a day of revival." Asked how the strength of Japan in Nanyang compares to that of overseas Chinese, he replied, "In theory, economic decline is a universal phenomenon, and the Japanese should also be affected. However, the fact is beyond expectations. The Japanese business in the Dutch East Indies is not only not declining, but is flourishing. What is the reason for this? Because at least 80% of the suppliers of various manufactured products in the two oceans market are Japanese. Except for those who operate in local products, most of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are distributors of Japanese goods. These overseas Chinese who distribute Japanese goods are gradually in danger of being eliminated. Because the Japanese have learned from the domestic and overseas Chinese boycott movement, since September 18th, they have imitated overseas Chinese and opened small grocery stores everywhere, specializing in selling Japanese goods directly to the natives. The power of overseas Chinese is gradually unsustainable." Asked how the sales of domestic goods in the Nanyang market are, he replied, "It is very shameful to say that there are more than 1.3 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, but Chinese goods account for only 2-3%. The Japanese have only five or six thousand people, but Japanese goods almost dominate the entire market. This is because Japanese goods are dumped at low prices and penetrate everywhere. It is not that overseas Chinese do not work hard to promote domestic goods in Nanyang. First, Chinese industry is backward, and only in recent years has there been a vigorous atmosphere, but the Nanyang market has been preempted by Japanese goods. Second, the industrial center of China is unfortunately in Shanghai, and most of the overseas Chinese are from Fujian and Guangdong, and they are not familiar with the situation in Shanghai. If the factories are located in Xiamen, Guangzhou, or Hong Kong, domestic goods will definitely be able to go there more. For example, dry batteries, cotton yarn shirts, etc. produced in Hong Kong have considerable sales in Nanyang. Third, Shanghai factories have always rarely sent people to Nanyang to promote goods, and even if people go, they are less effective because of language barriers and unfamiliarity with the local conditions in Nanyang. Fourth, Shanghai manufacturers do not pay much attention to the goods shipped to Nanyang, which causes distributors to suffer significant losses, and Shanghai manufacturers are often greedy for small immediate profits and do not pay attention to the quality of the goods. For example, umbrellas have a large sales volume in the Dutch East Indies, but Shanghai manufacturers did not pay attention. After shipping lacquer to oil umbrellas to Java, the lacquer melted due to the hot weather, making it difficult to open. Therefore, the sales of Shanghai umbrellas have gradually been seized by Japanese umbrellas. Fifth, Chinese merchants do lack some patriotism. They often pass off Japanese goods as domestic goods. For example, 3G and 3K shirts were originally very popular in Java, but some overseas Chinese who were blinded by profit sent samples to Japan to imitate them. Because Japanese prices are cheaper, the market is disrupted. Sixth, Nanyang lacks some publicity for domestic goods. If more domestic goods exhibitions are held, overseas Chinese will naturally pay attention to domestic goods. Secondly, more domestic goods stores should be opened so that overseas Chinese have the opportunity to buy domestic goods, because there are very few businesses that are completely engaged in domestic goods business." Asked about his opinion on the promotion of domestic goods, he replied, "The most important thing is not to be greedy for small immediate profits, improve the quality of goods, and pay attention to publicity work. Then the promotion of domestic goods will definitely be very smooth." Finally, according to Mr. Chen, he has been introduced by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and has visited many factories. If other factories want to promote goods in Nanyang, they can contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Center to help them contact.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Held a Meeting Yesterday to Request Funding for the Establishment of a Rayon Factory</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association convened industry leaders from the two provinces yesterday for an emergency meeting to discuss fundamental ways to save the silk industry. Representatives from silk industry associations in various districts of the two provinces attended, including Shi Yunqing, Ma Yangshi, Yu Wenqing, and Mo Yong from Suzhou; Wang Wuquan and Zhao Fuzhong from Hangzhou; Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, Wu Niannong, and Xu Wenbing from Shanghai; Shen Tingquan from Shaoxing; Shen Tonghua and Wu Xingcheng from Huzhou; Wang Shihua from Danyang; and dozens of others. The meeting began at 3:30 PM, and Wang Jiean was elected as the chairman. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting and read out the proposals from various districts, which were discussed one by one. (1) The proposal from the Wuxian Gauze and Satin Industry Association stated that the business of domestic real silk satin was sluggish and declining, while foreign and domestic rayon fabrics were beautiful and attractive, catering to the psychology of women, so sales were better than real silk fabrics. As a result, European and American countries imported tens of millions of yuan worth of rayon into China every year. Such a huge outflow urgently needs to be saved, otherwise, the people will be poor and the wealth will be exhausted, which is deeply concerning. If China bans rayon, then silk will definitely disappear, and foreign silk will take the opportunity to invade, and the outflow will be ten times greater than today. Fortunately, the US cotton loan has been successful and has been decided by the Central Political Conference to be used for productive enterprises. Based on this reason, it is proposed to petition the National Government to approve a part of the cotton and wheat loan to establish a rayon factory to stop the outflow and save the silk industry from danger. After discussion, everyone agreed that the price of rayon in the East Neighbor (Japan) is only half of that in Jiangsu and Zhejiang because there are no taxes, so the price of Japanese silk is also cheaper than that of China. If China uses Western rayon, the cost of making silk will be more expensive than Japanese silk due to high import duties. How can it compete with Japanese silk? Therefore, if we do not set up our own rayon factory and only use Western rayon, not only will the outflow be very large, but also although the silk factory will be able to stand, the result is a consensus to petition the National Government to approve the allocation of 20 million yuan of cotton and wheat loans to establish a rayon factory to save profits and save from danger. Secondly, the discussion of the Hangzhou representatives requested that the silk industry be saved. After careful discussion by the representatives, everyone agreed that Western-style clothing is now popular, and all use foreign goods, and even children wear Western-style clothing, and most of the Chinese robes and jackets also use foreign goods such as foreign silk. No wonder the domestic silk cloth is so decadent. If we do not urgently seek to save it, we will all wear foreign goods. It was decided that (1) industry regulations should be rectified and production should be controlled to avoid oversupply and self-defeat; (2) the association should notify the local silk satin industry associations to inform all colleagues to wear domestic clothing; (3) the Executive Yuan should be submitted to reinstate the previous order to restrict civil servants to wear domestic goods; (4) the Ministry of Education should be requested to order the national education bureaus to strictly prohibit teachers and students in all schools from wearing Western-style clothing, and all should wear domestic clothing except for gymnastics; (5) manufacturing methods should be improved; (6) the Yuanbu should be requested to temporarily exempt rayon import duties before rayon is produced in China, and then add heavy taxes to foreign goods after there are domestic goods; (7) more domestic goods companies should be established so that there are stores that specialize in selling domestic goods and stop the dumping of foreign goods.</p>

<h3>The Central Government Exempts Business Tax on Cotton Receiving Offices and Branch Offices of Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of business tax in various provinces, all cotton receiving offices and branch offices of yarn factories are also subject to the tax, which is inconsistent with the unified tax regulations. Exemptions have been applied for many times and disputes have lasted for years. Recently, Xie Zuokai, Tang Xinghai, Li Shengbo and others, members of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, negotiated with the authorities, and the central government and provincial governments have agreed to approve the exemption. The original text of the central government's reply is disclosed below. According to the petition submitted to the Ministry by representatives of the Chinese Yarn Factory Association, the yarn factory office is the agency representing the yarn factory, which is the same as the Da Zhonghua Firecracker Company case, and its cotton receiving office is the agency representing the yarn factory collecting raw materials, which is the same nature as the flour factory purchasing wheat. It is requested to be exempted from business tax. After investigation, if the branch offices of each yarn factory engage in the sale of cotton yarn (regardless of whether it is produced by the factory) or other goods, according to the provisions of the first item of the interpretation method in the Ministry's previous advisory to the provinces and cities, business tax should still be levied. However, if the branch offices of each yarn factory are only responsible for contacting and transferring on behalf of the factory, and do not have the nature of sales and marketing, and have no business income, and the branch office has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration, it can submit the registration and the relevant supporting documents of the nature of the business and submit it to the Ministry to instruct the competent authority to verify the facts again, and then it can be exempted in accordance with the Da Zhonghua Firecracker Company branch office case. As for the original petition, the cotton receiving offices set up by yarn factories are also the agencies representing the yarn factories to collect raw materials, and have no business behavior, which is the same nature as the flour factories purchasing wheat, which is still the actual situation. In order to rescue the yarn industry and take care of the difficulties of merchants, the Ministry has approved the method for exempting each yarn factory's cotton receiving office from buying cotton raw materials. First, each yarn factory must be registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the cotton receiving office set up directly buys cotton, which is indeed only for the raw materials of the factory's textile, and has no sales business behavior, and does not concurrently operate other goods. A certificate is issued by the local Chamber of Commerce, and the competent levy authority verifies the agreement, and business tax should be exempted. Second, if there is a shadow enterprise license number, set up a village number to buy in the place of origin, or other merchants operating cotton, in order to prevent sales and profit, and take the opportunity to steal and leak, business tax should still be levied to show restrictions. According to the previous situation, in addition to the distribution and approval, Xiangying Advisory request for verification, instruct the competent authorities to verify and comply with the one-size-fits-all, and prevent disputes. This consults the provincial and municipal governments.</p>

<h3>Public Memorial for Wang Leping Yesterday</h3>

After the memorial, the coffin was moved to Longhua Station, and the railway bureau prepared a car to transport it back to his hometown. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>

From there southward to the Shandong Guild Hall, route signs will be placed along the way. At the entrance of the Shandong Guild Hall, a plain white archway will be erected, with a plaque in the middle stating "Public Memorial for Mr. Wang Leping."

<h3>A Glimpse of Memorial Couplets</h3>
<p>Many important figures from the Party and the nation have sent memorial couplets. Excerpts are as follows: (Wang Faqin) "Why did you kill the gentleman? Ten thousand miles to summon the soul, hearing night cries. How many shared hardship and adversity? For three years, buried bones have green mountains." (Kong Xiangxi) "Twenty years of striving for the nation, arduously and fortunately, yet a virtuous and heroic man has fallen. The sound of the Huangpu River tide still sobs. Three times, across the miles, he returns for burial, forever cherishing his heroism, while the mountains of Que and Hua stand majestically." (Wu Tiecheng) "Thirty years of distinguished service, his reputation still lingers in Licheng. One morning, a shocking tragedy, how much weeping and mourning for Jiangnan." (Li Liejun) "Such rivers and mountains, difficult for those who die later. A lifetime of brilliance, alas, a departed martyr."</p>
<h3>Public Memorial Oration</h3>
<p>On this 15th day of October, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, we respectfully offer clear wine and simple dishes to the spirit of Mr. Wang Leping, saying: At the foot of Mount Tai, a unique spirit flourishes. Mr. Wang obtained it and was capable of great fearlessness. Dedicating himself to revolution for thirty years, he was not swayed by material possessions, and his integrity grew stronger. He once penetrated deep into enemy strongholds alone, remaining calm, facing life and death. Residing in Shanghai, he advocated democracy, offending the world's taboos, his blood flowing on the riverbanks. Our beautiful rivers and mountains are half-submerged by foreign powers. National humiliation and great disgrace to the nation. The times are deteriorating day by day, cause for lamentation. The dead are gone; what can the living redeem? Alas, may you enjoy this offering.</p>
<h3>Zhan Jifeng Appointed Legal Advisor to the Garrison Command</h3>
<p>Wu, the concurrently serving Commander of the Songhu Garrison, yesterday appointed lawyer Zhan Jifeng as legal advisor to the Command. It is reported that Mr. Zhan is a renowned lawyer in Shanghai. Since Commander Qian Dajun was in charge of the Songhu Garrison in the 17th year of the Republic, he admired Mr. Zhan's reputation and appointed him as legal advisor. When Commander Xiong Tianyi succeeded him, he continued to retain Mr. Zhan. For several years, his contributions were remarkable. Mr. Zhan resigned due to illness last spring, and the position remained vacant since then. Now, Commander Wu, who is also the mayor, believes that as the Garrison is transferring criminals to the concession courts, a representative with profound legal knowledge and familiarity with the concession agreements is needed to be competent. Since Mr. Zhan is currently serving as the legal advisor to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and is already familiar with the situation, he has been appointed concurrently as the legal advisor to the Garrison.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Dining Car Refuses to Sell Chinese Tea The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Railway Bureau for Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway dining car's refusal to sell Chinese tea, which violates the duty of promoting national products, yesterday sent a letter to the two Railway Administration Bureaus for negotiations. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the esteemed, on the 13th of this month, we received a letter from the Hangzhou Gate Tea Association stating that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has been operating Qiantang Bore Tide Viewing special trains for several decades. The sales of Longjing tea leaves and West Lake lotus root powder, specialty products of Zhejiang, as well as Hangzhou-prepared snacks, have been handled by passenger car operators, which has greatly promoted production and sales. However, we have learned with great shock that this year, the Railway Bureau is operating Qiantang Bore Tide Viewing special trains, implementing a 'noble' system, not attaching third-class passenger vehicles, and prohibiting the sale of Zhejiang's special agricultural products such as Longjing tea and other food items, limiting sales to French pastries, milk, and black tea, as evidenced by railway printed orders. We believe that in modern national society, agricultural finance is the lifeline for survival. Longjing tea is a special agricultural product that has been subjected to foreign encroachment in recent years, with a significant impact. We are thinking of ways to remedy the situation, but unexpectedly, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau's Qiantang Bore Tide Viewing special trains suddenly changed their old regulations, restricting sales of Zhejiang Longjing tea. Although the sales volume of the Qiantang Bore Tide Viewing special trains is small, it is related to the observation of people from various countries, and the promotion power is very large. If the restriction is allowed, the impact will be great, and it is not a trivial matter related to people's livelihoods. Therefore, we respectfully request that you immediately forward this to the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau for investigation and handling in accordance with the old regulations for the Qiantang Bore Tide Viewing special trains over the years, and do not be exploited by foreigners, rashly restricting the sale of foreign pastries, milk, and black tea, in order to protect the life of agricultural product Longjing tea. Regarding the sale of food and beverages on the railway cars, although it is handled by charter cars, the Railway Bureau should have the responsibility of supervision at any time. Traditionally, only hotels and public entertainment venues have taken advantage of the tendency of people to be westernized and specifically promote foreign goods, which has long been criticized by the general public. If this kind of prohibiting the sale of domestic food and beverages and limiting the sale of foreign goods is not the sole decision of the contractors, then it means that the state-run enterprise itself regards domestic goods as enemies, which is unreasonable in both emotion and logic. Therefore, we are responding by forwarding the situation. We respectfully request that your bureau promptly investigate and take effective measures to rectify the situation, to ensure public friendship."</p>
<h3>News from the Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>Establishment of Additional Refugee Shelters in Ping The World Red Swastika Society previously organized two relief teams and established three temporary shelters in response to the war in Beiping to implement relief efforts. Now, it is reported that the society believes that the war in the northeast and northwest of Ping has not yet subsided, and the refugees fleeing the disaster continue to arrive. At this time when the autumn wind is biting and people are suffering from cold and hunger, yesterday, four additional shelters were set up in the suburbs of Ping, including the Fourth Shelter at Andingmen, the Fifth Shelter at Lishuiqiao Bridge, the Sixth Shelter at Jiajiayao, and the Seventh Shelter at Baishanzhuang. Lodging and food preparations are complete, and a large number of people are being sheltered. At the same time, two additional relief teams were formed, with the society's president, Wang Zhen Gui, serving as the supervising captain. Yesterday afternoon, he led more than 20 team members, police officers, and porters, carrying stretchers and medicines, to the Lishuiqiao area. Another team, led by Su Jinglin, is being prepared and organized, intending to depart immediately for Baishanzhuang and other places in the northwest of Ping to implement relief efforts.</p>
<p>Relief for the Jiaxiang Flood The General Headquarters of the World Red Swastika Society yesterday received a report from Cao Hengyuan, the captain of the third relief team, on the distribution of relief in the Jiaxiang flood area of Shandong Province, which stated: "We are now reporting the progress of our team's distribution in the Jiaxiang disaster area. We found that 44 villages in the first, third, and fourth districts were affected by the disaster, with 1,117 extremely poor households. The relief funds distributed this time were divided into three grades: the first grade was for households whose houses were washed away by the water, with a distribution of three yuan per household; the second and third grades were for those who could not earn a living due to the flood, with a distribution of three yuan or one yuan per household depending on the size of the household. A total of over 1,870 yuan was distributed, and the distribution was completed yesterday. Today, the team is returning to Ning, and the city of Jinning Southwest Township, which was affected by the disaster, is scheduled to be visited by the team tomorrow to distribute funds separately."</p>
<h3>Achievements of Xu Zifeng Dental Hospital</h3>
<p>The Xu Zifeng Dental Hospital on Grollo Road, with its magnificent architecture and complete equipment, is one of the leading dental hospitals in this port. Its doctors, Xu Zhuorong and Zhou Wenzhong, are highly skilled and experienced, and are especially praiseworthy. Those who suffer from all kinds of rare and acute dental diseases, once treated, are invariably restored to health. Their inlay and filling procedures are especially exquisite. When false teeth are placed on the gums, it is difficult to distinguish them from the real ones. If the teeth that are inlaid are in any way unsuitable, they are immediately remodeled without fear of trouble, and they are only satisfied when they meet the needs of the patients. This is why they are famous far and wide, not by chance.</p>

<h3>French Concession Will Have a Charity Hospital Affiliated with Guangci Hospital</h3>
<p>The French Concession Charity Association, at a meeting of the board of directors on the 5th of this month, resolved to allocate 345,000 yuan from its public funds to build a charity medical room in Guangci Hospital, so that Chinese poor people living in the French Concession who are ill can be safely sent to the hospital for treatment. The internal layout and equipment of the hospital will be modeled after the latest-style four-story Western-style buildings. If future expansion is insufficient, the hospital can add a five-story building, which will include the following departments: a medical treatment department with 300 beds, a registration room, a dental clinic, and an emergency room. The layout of each department is complete. The Charity Association will allocate 30,000 yuan per year as annual operating expenses. For Guangci Hospital, 100 beds have been allocated, which are distributed free of charge by the Public Works Bureau to treat public patients in the concession. The French Concession Municipal Council and the management of the hospital will cooperate in the closest manner, so a management advisory committee has been established.</p>
<p>The personnel in charge of the association include representatives from the Jiangnan Catholic Church Hospital, the Public Works Bureau, and the Charity Association. The Charity Association is entirely dedicated to the well-being of the Chinese poor in the French Concession. The hospital is affiliated with Guangci Hospital in recognition of Guangci Hospital, which has a history of twenty-five years since its establishment and has made great achievements in the public welfare of the French Concession. The Huatong Public School, which the Charity Association founded last year on Saiposai Road, has achieved remarkable results in the past year. Although the number of classrooms has increased and can accommodate 830 students, it is still unable to accommodate all the students. The board of directors has resolved to continue setting up classrooms and expects to accommodate 1,000 students next spring.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Flood Situation in Chongbaoqi Three Counties</h3>
<p>Jiang Gantting, Fan Tai, and Xu Jishuang, three members of the Southern Sichuan Chongbaoqi Five Counties Flood Relief Association, recently went to Chongbaoqi three counties to investigate the actual situation in the disaster areas. The findings of the three members are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Qidong</h3>
<p>Located north of Chongming County, adjacent to Haimen on one side, and surrounded by rivers and seas on three sides, the entire county is divided into eight districts, making transportation very inconvenient. Two sudden surges of flood tide rose more than ten feet, and 90 breaches occurred on the dikes along the river and sea coasts in various districts, totaling more than 12,000 zhang. More than 20 bridges, large and small, were washed away in the tributary rivers. In the northeast coastal areas, districts seven and eight, approximately 60 li, had 40 breaches. District six along the river was also breached twice. The flood tide was rapid, and the waves were turbulent. In an instant, six or seven villages in the countryside were swept away, and two-fifths of the entire county became a flooded area. The disaster area covers an area of more than 241,000 mu, with more than 70,000 victims, most of whom are homeless. Among them, more than 350 people drowned, and more than 7,100 houses collapsed. The loss of flowers, grains, etc., amounted to more than 3 million yuan, and the price of drowned livestock was approximately 800,000 yuan. Moreover, after the affected fields were soaked by seawater salt, they will not be suitable for cultivation for three years. The direct and indirect losses cannot be counted. Recently, the weather has gradually cooled, and dozens of victims are huddled together in groups, without food or clothing, which is a tragic sight. Because Qidong is low-lying, it has suffered particularly severely.</p>
<h3>Chongming</h3>
<p>Located northeast of Baoshan, surrounded by rivers on all sides, the most severely affected areas are the F康 Town in the fifth district and the Beixin Village. The entire embankment was destroyed, farmland was submerged, and houses collapsed. There are approximately 9,000 victims in the district. Second, in the first district, Hongmei and other nine villages, 70-80% of the embankments were also destroyed. More than 30,000 mu of farmland were affected, and more than 1,000 houses collapsed. Statistics show that the entire county has approximately 433,000 mu of affected farmland, approximately 10,800 houses, more than 39,000 victims, and more than 200 deaths.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Located in the east of Jiangsu, the affected areas are Changxingsha, Dongxingsha, Ruifengsha, Dingxingsha, Shitousha, and Ping'ansha, totaling six sandbars, which are in the north of Baoshan and are divided into four villages. There are more than 25,000 mu of fields, which all produce rice and wheat. The area is shaped like a sand belt, surrounded by water on all sides, and transportation is inconvenient. There are hidden sandbars along the coast, and ships cannot dock unless the tide rises. Since 1919, it has suffered from hurricanes and floods, but this storm was huge, and many official and private embankments were breached. There are approximately 10,000 victims, 2,800 houses collapsed and were washed away, 29 people drowned, and the loss of rice and grain was approximately more than 100,000 yuan. The households in this village are mostly guest籍, mostly from Beisha. After the disaster, there was no harvest, and many went to other places to seek a living.</p>
<h3>Summary of Continued Emergency Relief in Chuansha</h3>
<p>After the China Jisheng Association organized the first emergency relief effort in Yuanyuan Sandbar in Chuansha, it organized a second relief effort yesterday. Mr. Mu Jiaxuan was again appointed as the director and set off again. Another 200 shi of relief rice, 2,500 bamboo poles for building sheds, tens of thousands of jin of rice straw, and hundreds of cotton-padded clothes were transported to the disaster area for relief. However, the disaster is large, and the rice is scarce, making it difficult to cover the entire area. It is hoped that all kind-hearted people and those concerned about their hometowns will continue to provide assistance so that the stranded fish can recover slightly and not all die in the ditch.</p>
<h3>Frequent Labor Strikes in British and American Factories The Three-Factory Work Stoppage May Resume Work Tomorrow The First and Second Factories' Termination of Fees Caused Disputes</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after the workers of the British-American Factory No. 3 on Taopeng Road went on strike on the afternoon of the 13th to protest the factory's recognition of the labor union and other demands, the Social Affairs Bureau considered it inappropriate and instructed the cigarette union in District Four to stop it. It was also scheduled for discussions on the 17th, and it is expected that work will resume today. Unexpectedly, the new and old factories rejected the labor union's collection of membership fees, and after unsuccessful negotiations with the union, disputes are about to arise again. The union is scheduled to hold a representatives' meeting to respond, and will submit a request to the Party and government for a ban, as well as request revisions to the management methods and labor-management mutual aid conditions. The detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Factory Labor Strike at Three Factories</h3>
<p>Following criticism from the Social Affairs Bureau regarding the labor strike at the Anglo-American Third Factory on Taopeng Road, the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union dispatched Executive Director Zhou Xuexiang to mediate. Work resumed successively as a result, awaiting the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation on the 17th. However, the workers insisted on their demands, which remained unresolved. Consequently, the General Labor Union assigned Executive Director Zhou Xuexiang to continue mediating. As yesterday was a regular weekly holiday, it was expected that work would resume as usual this morning. However, workers expressed that if mediation proves ineffective, they are determined to continue their opposition.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Collect Membership Dues</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Anglo-American First and Second Factories in Pudong was temporarily resolved through mediation by Party and government authorities. Unexpectedly, the factory management recently violated the mediation agreement by refusing to pay wages for the strike period and posting notices prohibiting the collection of membership dues. They threatened to dismiss any worker found collecting dues. Upon hearing this, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, citing the long-standing practice of collecting membership dues without prior objection from the factory, deemed this a deliberate attempt to undermine the labor movement. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Government for intervention, they also sent Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Zhang Yuping, and others to the factory for unsuccessful negotiations yesterday.</p>
<h3>Proposed Conditions</h3>
<p>After the union representatives' unsuccessful negotiations, they formally proposed five methods for collecting dues in writing: (1) Dues collection should continue according to existing practices; (2) If the factory cannot accommodate this, it should follow the example of the British-owned Xiang Sheng Iron Factory and the Hua Cheng Tobacco Factory by deducting dues on a monthly basis; (3) If the factory cannot accommodate even this, the union should send representatives to the factory monthly to collect dues next to the wage disbursement table; (4) Dues collection should be limited to union members; (5) Workers responsible for collecting dues should be granted temporary leave, always with the principle of not hindering the factory's operations.</p>
<h3>Delegates' Congress</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the factory did not provide a satisfactory response to the union's letter, and negotiations reached a standstill. The factory even posted a notice claiming that workers reported the ban on dues collection. The union considered this a deliberate provocation. In addition to petitioning the Party and government authorities for impartial intervention, they scheduled an emergency delegates' congress to discuss countermeasures. On the 15th of this month, dues collection will continue as usual. Furthermore, the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, noting that their demands for revising management rules and labor-management mutual aid conditions have not been met, leaving workers bound by the original terms, specifically dispatched Chen Peide, Lou Jingguan, Zhang Yuping, Xiao Gengsheng, and others to the Municipal Government to petition for prompt revisions to prevent further unrest.</p>
<h3>Official Document to the Party and Government</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union submitted a document to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the factory's obstruction of dues collection necessitates prompt mediation to maintain union affairs. The document stated that the union's monthly dues collection has been conducted by representatives, without objection from the factory, since its establishment. However, the factory recently posted a notice claiming it was acting under the Social Affairs Bureau's orders to prohibit dues collection and threatening to dismiss any worker found collecting dues. It also falsely claimed to be acting on worker reports, deliberately sowing discord. The union, based on worker reports, proposed five methods for collecting dues (omitted) to the factory, seeking a compromise. However, the factory completely rejected them. Further negotiations with the factory also failed. The union's monthly expenses and unemployment benefits for workers rely entirely on membership dues. If these are stopped, the union will inevitably collapse. The union has been collecting dues for many years, and this practice has never been changed. It does not hinder the factory's operations, so there is no reason to prohibit it. If the factory proceeds to dismiss workers who collect dues, it will inevitably trigger a major upheaval. Therefore, it urgently reported to the authorities, requesting prompt and impartial mediation to maintain union affairs and quell the unrest.</p>
<h3>No Changes in the Electric Company Labor Strike Yesterday, Some Say All Chinese Employees Will Return to Work This Morning, But the Lianyi Society Absolutely Denies It</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the strike by Chinese employees of the Shanghai Electric Company has lasted nearly half a month. Because the labor and management opinions have not reached a consensus, it is difficult to resolve urgently. Since the company lured a small number of Chinese employees to return to work, yesterday happened to be a weekly holiday, and the employees of various departments still insisted on striking, and there were no changes. The Shanghai Electric Company Colleagues' Lianyi Society, in addition to persuading the more than 30 people who were lured by the company to return to work to act together, will issue a notice to members to unanimously reject the Electric Company's enticement methods in order to consolidate unity. However, on the other hand, news came out that all Chinese employees will return to work this morning. However, the Lianyi Society said that the news was not certain and absolutely denied it. Let's record it to wait for confirmation.</p>

<h3>Introduction by the Preparatory Committee of the Tramp Factory, the Owed Wages of the Tramps' Work Are Being Sued, the Court Will Hear the Case This Morning</h3>
<p>The China Tramp Factory was initiated by more than 20 people, including Chou Gao Chen Yaoqing, Mao Guanhao, and Zhu Muyun, in February of this year, and was approved by the Municipal Government. The preparatory committee was established at No. 1 Shunzhen Lane, Hanqiao, Zhabei, but it has not yet been established. However, after the January 28th Shanghai War last year, there were even more unemployed tramps in the city. Generally, tramps asked the preparatory committee to help them in advance because they had no means of living. The committee introduced more than 80 tramps, including Lu Jingren, to Tian Shende Sauce Factory and other places in the city for sales. It is reported that the Tian Shen Factory was banned from selling because its products did not meet hygiene standards, so it announced the suspension of the sale of some sauces. Lu Jingren was laid off and owed the factory more than ten yuan, which he was unable to repay. It is reported that the factory owner, Mr. Li, has ordered his partner Gao Xinzhong to file a lawsuit in the local court to demand compensation from Mao Guanhao, the introducer and preparatory committee member of the China Tramp Factory. After the court verified the report, it scheduled to summon the plaintiff and defendant to the court this morning at 10 o'clock for cross-examination.</p>

The bandit was extremely fierce and held a box cannon in each hand, firing at the Chinese and Western detectives, etc. Both sides fired more than 100 shots.

<h3>The Criminal Investigation Team Cracked Down on Three Opium Dens, Arrested Eleven Male and Female Opium Addicts, Five Opium Pipes, and Five Oil Lamps</h3>

After verifying the letter, Lu ordered Chen Caishe, the leader of the detective team, to secretly investigate and verify the information. He then dispatched detectives Wei Feng, Zhao Huairen, Wu Songshan, Mao Gongzhao, etc., to cooperate with the police officers of the Second District to rush to the address the night before last. However, Wu had already fled upon hearing the news. Only opium and opium addicts were arrested on the spot, including (1) Wang Wenlong from Hunan (25 years old), (2) Wang Decai from Gaoyou (40 years old), (3) Shen Dezhang (20 years old), (4) Zhou Jiali from Hangzhou (25 years old), totaling four people.

Eleven male and female opium addicts were taken to the team for interrogation together with the opium pipes and oil lamps, and were sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday morning for handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Truck Breaks Cable, Large Chimney Falls and Kills Three People</h3>
<p>No. 13 Yichang Road, West Shanghai, was formerly the Fuyuanji Paper Shop, but it has now been relocated. It was founded by soy sauce merchants and is the Yiji Soy Sauce Essence Factory. Therefore, the soy sauce wooden barrels in the factory all have the "Zhang Chongxin" signboard. At about 11:45 yesterday morning, a No. 16912 truck belonging to the Huang Fuji Freight Car Company on Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, loaded with a large number of wooden boards, was driving through the area. Because the truck was loaded too high, the iron wire tied to the iron sheet chimney on the roof broke. As a result, the chimney was broken immediately and fell down, injuring three workers in the car on the spot, including Zhang Fusheng, 28 years old, from Shaoxing, who was injured in the waist; Zhou Shaorong, 30 years old, from Ningbo, who was injured in the waist and feet; and Wu Agui, 26 years old, from Jiangbei, who was injured in the waist and abdomen.

The two gentlemen, in view of the fact that rural bankruptcy and unemployment are increasing, and in all commercial cities, bandits are robbing and kidnapping people for ransom, and the lives and property of the rich are becoming increasingly dangerous, have been carefully researching for more than a year for the sake of social security, and have invented the National Goods Eye Trademark Security Door Mirror, raised funds to set up a factory, and successfully manufactured it. It has been registered with the Industrial Department of the Social Affairs Bureau Trademark Bureau, and the procedures have been completed. It will be sold on the market soon.</p>
<h3>Hongshun Mutual Aid Society Called Group Leaders for Training Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hongshun Mutual Aid Society has recently increased the number of members and the affairs of the society are becoming increasingly complex. In order to facilitate the progress, a group leader is set up for every ten members to take charge of collecting membership dues and white money fees. It has now been compiled. At 8:00 p.m. the night before last, all group leaders were specially called for training. More than 60 group leaders attended. Chairman Wu Zichang and recorder Zhao Yunpu performed the ceremony. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting and the responsibilities of each group leader, hoping that the group leaders would work hard to collect membership white money fees. The relocation of members' houses should be investigated, reported, and corrected. Next, former chairman Yang Wendao reported the reasons for resigning from the chairman of the committee, saying briefly that he was unable to take care of both public and private affairs, so he resigned from the position of chairman. Comrade Wu Yuchang was elected to act on his behalf and take responsibility. He hoped that all the group leaders would obey the guidance of Chairman Wu. As for himself, he is still an executive committee member. For the affairs of the society, he will still do his best to fulfill his responsibility if he can take care of them, and hoped that the members would be informed and not misunderstood. The society has now appointed Yang Daxuan, Pu Fengming, and Yang Zhijian as instructors. The three comrades have knowledge, experience, and perseverance. It is hoped that everyone will listen to their guidance, and the affairs of the society will definitely be able to develop in the future. Next, Liao Weiming, director of the General Affairs Department, and instructor Pu Fengming, etc., successively gave speeches, all encouraging everyone to unite and understand the reasons for Comrade Yang Wendao's resignation as chairman, and not to misunderstand. Later, group leaders Li Hanyun, Hong Wenwei, and Li Yiyun, etc., proposed that the matter be submitted to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for a decision. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Medical World</h3>
<p>Liu Jiansan, a Doctor of Medicine, Suspends His Kettle. Liu Jiansan, a member of the Central National Medical Center, was previously hired by Hechang Foreign Firm in this port to treat various intractable diseases. Mr. Qiu of Hechang Firm suffered from liver and stomach qi disease for nearly 20 years, but he was able to cure it completely in a short period of time. If gynecological lung disease is known as a difficult disease to cure, he has also cured three or four people. The most miraculous thing is that Mr. Cai Youmin had to travel far away due to business reasons. He was about to pack his bags when he suddenly suffered from a severe typhoid fever. Both Chinese and Western doctors were rarely responsible for the answer. Later, he hired Mr. Liu to treat him, and he was able to set off as scheduled. Mr. Liu has now rented No. 10 Shanhai Pass Road and opened a room to suspend his kettle.</p>
<p>The Development of Hongfu Obstetrics Hospital. Hongfu Obstetrics Hospital, No. 277 Tianjin Road in this port, was founded by Mr. Zhang Mingquan. Medical services are developing and are growing day by day. It has hired female doctor Wang Yichen, who specializes in obstetrics, and female doctors Gu Bin, who studied in Japan, and Chen Xusheng, a doctor of medicine, etc., to be the directors of various departments. They are not sure of grasping everything about dangerous and difficult deliveries and intractable diseases. It is now reported that in order to facilitate poor patients, the medical expenses are not counted, so the consultations are becoming increasingly complicated.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the chief editor of the Shen Bao, I am deeply surprised to read the news published on the fourth page of your newspaper on the 15th of this month, [Launching the Reconstruction of the Cao E Filial Daughter Temple], and see that my name is listed in the documentary committee. After checking, the members of the association were mutually elected from the initiators. I am not the initiator, so how could I be elected as a member? This must have been a typographical error by the reporter who recorded and sent the manuscript at the meeting, resulting in the fact that the news did not match the facts. I would like to ask your newspaper to record a letter to correct it. Please write and be well. Respectfully, Shou Xiaotian, October 15, 21st year.</p>

<h3>Overview of Decathlon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) Zhang Lingjia set a new national record in the decathlon. Chen Ling of Shanghai also broke the national record. In the second half of the decathlon competition, Zhang Lingjia of Beiping won the decathlon with 5889.587 points. Chen Ling of Shanghai was the runner-up, also scoring 5607.605 points. The results of the top two both broke the national record held by Liu Renxiu. Chen Baoqiu of Shanghai was third, and although he did not participate in the pole vault, he still scored 5408.105 points, which was close to the national record. Cao Baoyu of Shanghai was fourth with a score of 5248.75. Chen Baoqiu initially led in the first half of the competition. However, in the second half, he did not score in the pole vault. Otherwise, Chen's performance would have been unstoppable. Here is an overview of the top six: (1) Zhang Lingjia is a veteran of the decathlon in China. It is said that Liu Renxiu abandoned the competition in the first half, and Zhang already had the championship in his hands. Zhang got 11.7 seconds in the 100 meters, which was beyond his own expectations. Zhang, who weighs over 180 kilograms, has never had such a result. Among the last five events, Zhang is a thrower in high jump, discus, and javelin. He even got 443 points in the pole vault, which he is not good at. However, in the 400 meters of the first five events, he only ran 57 seconds in the dark. His usual result is 55 seconds. If everything could go as planned, he could be expected to exceed 6500 points. (2) Chen Ling excels in running and jumping in all events, but his throwing skills are slightly worse. The 100 meters, high jump, and pole vault are the reasons for Chen's victory. He scored over 800 points in the high jump and over 700 points in the 100 meters and pole vault. However, his score in the three throwing events was too low, which is why Chen is not as good as Zhang. (3) Chen Baoqiu is the opposite of Chen Ling. He is good at throwing but bad at pole vault. He only tried one jump and fell into the pit with the pole, causing the whole audience to laugh. Chen refused to jump again and gave up. If Chen did not have this shortcoming, no one would be able to beat him. (4) Cao Yu is an old general and the champion of the previous competition. His hopes for this competition are very weak. Cao's efforts are definitely not inferior to others. His score also relies on running, jumping, and high jump, which is unexpected. (5) Zhao Enji was originally a famous decathlete in North China, but he failed due to the pentathlon, leading to his defeat. Zhao took the lead in the high jump race. The 100 meters, long jump, high jump, and 400 meters are also Zhao's scoring events, but the three throwing events are too bad. Otherwise, he could have been selected. (6) Fu Baolu's participation in the decathlon is not to win the championship, but to make up for his pole vault. Fu broke the national record in the pole vault final with 3.75 meters a few days ago, but because it was dark, he could not jump again, so he gave up. On the 15th, Fu focused on this event in the decathlon. Fu jumped over 3.40 meters, 3.50 meters, 3.60 meters, and 3.70 meters. When he raised it to 3.85 meters, he also jumped over it in one try. Then the referee raised it to 4 meters. Fu did not have this strength, so he requested to set it at 3.95 meters. If he could jump over this height, he could equal 1000 points of the world's decathlon pole vault record. In the first jump, his hand slightly touched the crossbar and caused the pole to fall. The second jump was a step. The third jump was successful, and the audience couldn't help but shout. Unfortunately, the wind blew the pole to the ground, which was a great pity. The official result was only 3.85 meters, but it was still amazing. Judging from Fu's posture, it will not be difficult to jump over 4 meters in the near future, and he can get a position in the Far Eastern Games.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Wins All-Around Championship Again; Scores of Each Unit</h3>
<p>Champion: Shanghai, 44 points</p>
<p>Runner-up: Beiping, 18 points</p>
<p>Third place: Guangdong, 14 points</p>
<p>Fourth place: Nanjing, 8 points</p>
<p>Fifth place: Fujian, 4 points</p>
<h3>Hao Chunde's Pentathlon Did Not Break the Far Eastern Record; The 9th Far Eastern Games Still Used the Old Scoring Method; The Current New Scoring Method Has Different Algorithms; Hao and Wang Are Still Far Behind with the New Scoring Method; This Newspaper Exclusively Noted Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) In the pentathlon, Hao Chunde and Wang Jihuai of Shanghai won the championship and runner-up, respectively. The fact that their scores exceeded 3000 points shocked the country and is indeed a valuable harvest for the track and field community in China in recent times. At the same time, after this record was discovered, newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places all used the largest fonts as headlines, claiming that this record broke the Far Eastern record, and even the special edition of the Games also published it in this way, which is laughable due to a lack of knowledge. The highest record created by Kosaku Sumiyoshi of Japan in the 9th Far Eastern Games was 2838 points, which is indeed less than the total score of Hao and Wang this time, but it must be known that the scoring methods are different. The 9th Far Eastern Games used the old scoring method, and now the new scoring method has been adopted. The old and new algorithms are different. The old one is less, and the new one is more. If the Far Eastern record of 2838 points is calculated using the new method, it will be around 3500 points, and Hao and Wang are still far behind. This kind of error is really a joke. Only this newspaper made a special note on the 15th, but the official promotional materials of the Games are still spreading the error.</p>
<p>The 10,000-Meter Dispute Comes to an End</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Resolution of the Joint Conference; The Judging Committee Held a Meeting Yesterday and Resolved; Jiangsu Will Maintain Sportsmanship and No Longer Protest; The Judgment Is Officially Released, and the Results Are Canceled</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) The Judging Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 15th and decided to uphold the resolution of the Joint Competition and Judging Conference. Later, Zhang Dongping, the leader of the Jiangsu delegation, said that in order to maintain sportsmanship, Jiangsu Province could no longer protest the 10,000-meter decision according to law. This is an error in the duty of the referee of the Games. In the future, other legal methods will be used to ask colleagues in the sports community to jointly study the 10,000-meter judgment process.</p>
<h3>The Judgment Is Officially Released</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) Zhang Boling, the chief referee, officially released the judgment on the 10,000-meter race, saying that according to the resolution of the joint meeting of the 14th Competition Committee and the Judging Committee, the number 180 athlete participating in the 10,000-meter race was invalid. Therefore, this chief referee judges that in the 10,000-meter race, the first place is number 13, the second place is number 284, the third place is number 16, and the fourth place is number 15, but there are no official results.</p>
<h3>Rejecting Jiangsu's Protest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) The Judging Committee convened a meeting at the Central Hotel at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th to discuss the Jiangsu delegation's letter of protest against the 10,000-meter judgment. Chairman Zhang Boling ruled that the grounds for the protest were unfounded and sent a letter to Zhang Dongping, the leader of the Jiangsu delegation, saying that after receiving your team's letter of protest regarding the 10,000 meters, this team convened a meeting on the morning of the 15th and refuted it item by item. The clauses are listed as follows: (1) This committee did not deny that Mr. Huang Shibin was an official lap counter. The statement that the lap count was inaccurate was an error admitted by Mr. Huang himself, so this protest cannot be established. (2) The chief referee's announcement that 180 was the first place was based on the verbal report of lap counter Huang Bobin, but the next day, his lap count sheet showed that number 180 had run 21 laps. At that time, Mr. Huang admitted that the record was wrong and stated that (if other lap counters can take responsibility, the report can be invalidated). Later, it was found that Jun Wenchang was ordered to record and was also responsible for stating that number 180 had only run 19 laps, one lap short, and there was a lap count sheet to prove it, so this protest cannot be established. (3) On the conference lap sheets, the numbers from 20 onwards were generally crossed out with a horizontal line, but on the lap sheet used by Mr. Huang, the numbers up to 20 and the number 1 were marked with an X, and the strength and color of the writing on the number 21 were exactly the same as those recorded on other numbers. This is enough to prove that his record was wrong, so this protest cannot be established. (4) During the 10,000-meter race, Committee Member Wang Zhengting watched from the east command platform and had no responsibility for formal recording, but according to his unofficial observation, from the second lap to the ninth lap, number 180 was not seen in the leading group, but from the tenth lap onwards, number 180 was seen in the leading group. According to the report of lap counter Li Wenchang, number 180 was one lap behind in the first ten laps, so this protest cannot be established. (5) This committee uses official reports as records. News reports should not be used as evidence, so this clause cannot be established. The above clauses have been reviewed by this committee in a meeting and deemed to be unfounded. Therefore, the resolution of the previous Competition Committee and Judging Committee joint meeting should still be implemented, and according to the provisions of Article 20 of the Competition Regulations, the protest fee should be confiscated, etc. A receipt for the protest deposit of ten yuan is attached. According to Zhang Dongping, if possible during the Games, he plans to invite the Jin athlete who competed in the 10,000 meters to perform an informal public performance with Jin Zhongkang to prove Jin Gu's strength.</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between Shanghai and Liaoning Soccer Teams Will Be Handled by the Judging Committee; After Shanghai Won 6-0 Against Liaoning, Jiang Shan Jing and Li Bairen Suddenly Brawled; The Order Was Disrupted, and the Game Was Stopped; The Liaoning Instructor Said the Record Should Be Canceled - Hong Kong Won 3-1 Against Beiping - It Is Not Easy to Win Against Strong Opponents</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) At 4:00 p.m. on the 15th, in the soccer match between Shanghai and Liaoning, referee Zhou Jiaqi, the Liaoning team was very strong. When they took to the field, they were flying all over the place. The Shanghai team had a hard time dealing with them. Moreover, Liaoning was in a favorable position with the wind, and their attacks often hovered near the Shanghai team's goal. Zhou's goal was to deal with it on both sides. Jiang Shan Jing's footwork was inaccurate, Xu Yahui was often robbed of the ball, and Li Yichen and Chen Jiaqiu couldn't kick the ball. The unexpected good performance of the Liaoning team was met with continuous cheers from the audience. In the third minute of the kickoff, Li Yichen took the ball and kicked it into the net within the inner defense, opening the scoring. After that, both sides fought fiercely for a long time without winning or losing. At 15 minutes, Liaoning committed a foul and was penalized with a 12-yard penalty kick, which Sun Jin converted into a goal. The Liaoning army did not lose heart and resisted to the end. At one point, they sent troops to attack. Once, Zhou Xianyan caught the ball, but due to the strong wind and rapid ball, he lost his grip, and the ball flew into the net, only an inch away from going in. Otherwise, it would have been dangerous. The Shanghai team also retaliated, with Wan Xianghua and Li Yichen each scoring a goal. The first half ended with a score of 4-0.</p>
<h3>Fighting Broke Out, and the Game Was Suspended</h3>
<p>In the second half, the teams switched sides and continued to fight. Liaoning was facing a headwind, making it even more difficult to cope. The Shanghai team replaced Luo Haiguang with Chen Hongguang. Chen's foot was hard and accurate, and he scored two more goals. Although Liaoning was defeated, they still launched a full-scale counterattack. With 16 minutes remaining in the second half, Liaoning's center forward dribbled straight into the heart of the Shanghai defense. Because the Shanghai defenders were surrounding him very closely, he kicked the ball to the left corner. Liaoning's left forward, Li Bairen, rushed to catch up, but the referee quickly blew the silver whistle for offside. Li did not pay attention and continued to kick the ball as before. Seeing the critical situation, Jiang Shanjing, the left inner guard of Shanghai, also rushed to intercept, but accidentally kicked Li's leg. Li thought it was intentional use of violence, so he punched and attacked. Jiang also fought back, and they twisted into a ball. The referee blew his whistle repeatedly and hugged Li. At that time, armed military police gathered around and forcibly dragged Li away. The audience also poured into the field, and some even planned to join the battle group. The situation was turbulent, and there was a sense of blaming the referee. Seeing that the order was disrupted and that his own reputation was in danger, Zhou Jiaqi announced the suspension of the game. According to Zhou, the details of the incident will be reported to the Judging Committee for fair handling. The Liaoning instructor said that since the referee has announced the suspension of the game, any records of this game should be canceled. His team can only listen to the fair resolution of the Games.</p>

<h3>Zhou Jiaqi's Report</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) Zhou Jiaqi, the referee of the Shanghai-Liaoning soccer game, wrote to the Competition Committee on the 15th, saying that in the second soccer game between Shanghai and Liaoning at 4:00 p.m. on the 15th, he served as the referee for the game. The result of the first half was 4-0, with Shanghai taking the lead. During the game, due to the rough kicking of a certain team, six irregular actions occurred throughout the game. Although he repeatedly penalized and warned, it was still ineffective. Sixteen minutes before the end of the game, the left wing of the Liaoning team violated the offside rule, so he blew his whistle to penalize. However, the left inner forward of the Liaoning team still did not stop his movement (the left inner forward was indeed number 14) and still rushed up and deliberately kicked the right back of the Shanghai team. Both sides clashed. He stepped forward to hug the assailant, and the player (Liaoning number 14) did not take any other actions. However, the players and spectators on both sides joined in the fight, and the order was disrupted. Fortunately, the military police were present and showed off their guns to threaten them, so no bloodshed occurred. However, this unfortunate incident has already occurred, and the players on both sides have a deep sense of animosity. If the game continues, there may be more unexpected disasters. Therefore, he announced on the spot (the game will not continue today). Moreover, the Liaoning team players refused to hand over the penalty, and he was unable to collect it. This is the reason why he cannot know the name of the number 14 player. He has made a detailed report on what happened at the time, hoping that the Competition Committee will decide what to do. This is submitted to the Competition Committee.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Attends Soccer Game</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) In the afternoon of the 15th, the two soccer games between Hong Kong and Beiping and Shanghai and Liaoning were very exciting. There were nearly 10,000 spectators, and the stands and surrounding areas were full. This is a record for the soccer field. The order was quite chaotic. Wu Tiecheng, Yang Hu, and others also went to watch and stood for a long time before leaving.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Defeats Beiping in Three Games; The Result Is 3-1; 3-0 in the First Half</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) In the soccer game between Hong Kong and Beiping at 2:00 p.m. on the 15th, Hong Kong won 3-1 and obtained the right to replay. Referee Chen Jixiang, in terms of strength, Hong Kong is more aggressive than Beiping, but Beiping's fighting spirit is very commendable.</p>
<h3>Too Eager to Win, Involving Roughness</h3>
<p>After the start of the war, the battle was fierce for a long time without winning or losing. The ball sometimes hovered in the square, with many dangerous situations. At 20 minutes, the Hong Kong center forward got the ball and went straight into the inner defense line, scoring a goal single-handedly, making the first contribution. After five minutes, Huang Meishun got the ball again. The Beiping team tried hard to counterattack, and the shouts shook far and wide. At that time, the actions of the Hong Kong army were quite rough. The left inner forward of Beiping, Fang Gechun, was injured and left the field. The Beiping goalkeeper was also punched by the Hong Kong army. At this time, the whole field was in an uproar, thinking that the actions were barbaric and should be warned. After the referee persuaded them to stop, the game continued. The Beiping army repeatedly counterattacked, but they were all waved out of bounds by Bao Gangmen. In the last ten minutes, the Hong Kong right forward got the ball and passed it to Zhou, the center forward, who gently kicked it, and it fell into the net again. The first half was 3-0, and Hong Kong won. During the break, a photographer asked the Hong Kong team to take a photo. The audience suddenly poured into the field. A person in a Sun Yat-sen suit shouted that the Hong Kong team was barbaric and did not deserve to compete, let alone take photos of them. The words were激昂 and there were loud shouts and beatings. The Hong Kong team's attitude at that time was very poor, saying that everything would follow the referee's orders, and finally, no incident occurred.</p>
<h3>Courage to Correct Mistakes and Peaceful Victory</h3>
<p>In the second half, the Hong Kong army changed to a defensive posture and did not抢球 very aggressively. The actions of the square were excessive. The inner guard injured Zheng Jiliang, the center forward of Hong Kong, and then left the field. The Hong Kong army was careful and courageous to correct their mistakes. The audience also gradually calmed down. At 30 minutes, the Hong Kong team was penalized with a 12-yard penalty kick, which was converted into a goal by Tang Guoliang of Beiping. Since then, Hong Kong has adopted a perfunctory extension policy. Although Beiping was lazy to counterattack, it was ultimately impenetrable due to its tight defense. In addition, Bao Gangmen was虎视眈眈 and saved 11 dangerous balls, unable to cross the line for even one step. The second half was 1-0, and Beiping won. The total score was 3-1, and the Hong Kong army won the right to replay.</p>
<h3>Spectator Loses Manner and Provokes Emotions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th) Most spectators do not understand the truth and shout loudly, and some even call for others to show obvious one-sided protection, which is close to provoking the emotions of the two teams. I hope the conference will pay attention to this point. In the initial battle between Hong Kong and Beiping, the Hong Kong team was eager to move forward and was slightly激列. The 后塲 was absolutely peaceful, so there was no talk of barbarism.</p>

<h3>Athletes Paid Respects at the Mausoleum Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) At 6 AM on the 15th, all athletes, managers, and the chief leader, with their respective unit flags in formation, led by Chu Minyi and Zhang Xinfu, walked to the Mausoleum of the Premier. Arriving at the altar platform at 7 AM, they held a memorial ceremony, sang the party song, saluted, and presented three wreaths: one from all staff members of the conference, two from the chief leaders and supervisors and managers, and three from all athletes. After the wreath presentation, the inner gate of the mausoleum was opened, and all followed the path into the mausoleum for a visit. At 8 AM, they posed for a group photo on the platform and returned to the field.</p>
<h3>The Conference Was Chaotic All Day Yesterday; The Future of the Conference Is Deeply Worrying; It Is Sincerely Hoped That the Authorities Will Pay Attention</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) On the 15th, the chaos continued, especially the assault by soldiers of the 88th Division and the disputes on the football field were even greater. The cause of the disputes on the football field was actually due to the audience's prejudice against the Shanghai team. Because Shanghai has won the all-around athletics championship and other titles, and also occupies a superior position in various ball games, it has aroused jealousy from all sides. Whenever the Shanghai team plays, there are unconscious shouts, especially the Liaoning players, who do not forget their motherland even in defeat, which aroused the sympathy of the masses. As for the skills of the Liaoning football team, they are indeed quite impressive, and their performance has improved a lot. We, with an impartial attitude, congratulate the winners and encourage the losers. We should be proud when we win and not be humiliated when we lose. Now the athletes cannot encourage themselves with this, but only care about winning or losing, to the point of acting impulsively, which is a loss of the original spirit of competition. The same incident occurred in the match between Ping and Hong Kong in football. It is truly a great misfortune for the conference and a misfortune for the sports community. Once this trend starts, the ball game playoffs in the last three days of the conference are deeply worrying. The aftermath of the Jie Zhou National Games has not subsided, and it is sincerely hoped that the conference will pay attention to seeking a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<h3>Hebei Defeats Harbin 63-16; Will Meet Shanghai in the Semifinals</h3>
<p>In the second women's basketball game, Hebei played against Harbin. The Harbin team was slow to act and far from being their opponent. Hebei's play was very commendable.</p>
<h3>Harbin Weakens as Soon as They Enter the Court</h3>

<h3>Women's Basketball Situation</h3>
<p>Women's Tennis</p>
<h3>Shanghai, Sichuan, and Shanxi Enter the Semifinals; Starts on the 17th</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) The second round of women's tennis has ended, with Shanghai, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Beiping securing spots in the semifinals. Starting at 2 PM on the 15th, the women's tennis competition continues. The second round has all concluded, resulting in Shanghai winning all three matches against Anhui, and Shanxi and Sichuan each eliminating Beijing and Hebei with a score of 2-1. After the rounds in the second round were decided, Shanghai, Shanxi, and Sichuan all secured spots in the semifinals, which will take place on the 17th.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the second round of women's tennis, Shanghai's Mao Yuwen, Anhui's Liu Yufang, and Sichuan's Bao Dajing defeated Hebei's Cui Shuzhen, and Shanxi's Wang Chunjing defeated Beijing's Liu Yulan. There are seven units that have secured a spot in the second round: Shanghai, Anhui, Sichuan, Hebei, Shanxi, Beijing, and Beiping. The competition began at 9 AM on the 15th, with the first singles match being Shanghai vs. Anhui, Sichuan vs. Hebei, Shanxi vs. Beijing, and Beiping having a bye. As a result, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Shanxi each won a singles match.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Triumphs, Winning All Matches Against Anhui; Result: 3-0</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the match between Shanghai and Anhui, Anhui faced Fujian in the preliminary round. Fujian only had two players participating in the doubles match, and they completely forfeited the two singles matches to Anhui, while Fujian's doubles team defeated Anhui. Therefore, Anhui's ability to secure a spot in the second round was purely due to chance, and their strength was only so-so. In the second round, they met Shanghai. Shanghai's talents are average, but the skills of the first singles player, Mao Yuwen, are particularly good. Anhui's Liu Yufang is far from being her opponent, so it formed a one-sided situation. As a result, Mao Yuwen won with two consecutive scores of 6-1.</p>
<p>Shanghai has already won the first singles match. Anhui forfeited the second singles match. Shanghai's Xia Lanzheng defeated Anhui's Sun Silan, with a score of 6-2, 7-5. Therefore, Shanghai won 3-0.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Is Fierce, Eliminating Nanjing; Result: 2-1</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the match between Shanxi and Beijing, Shanxi's Wang Chunjing's skills are skilled and unusually calm. It is a pity that her shots lack power. The reason for her victory lies entirely in the accuracy of her cross-court shots, making her opponent tired of running and watching her defeat. In the match against Beijing's Liu Yulan on the 15th, Wang also won in this way, with a score of 6-4, 6-1. Wang won two consecutive sets.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) The Beijing-Shanxi doubles match started at 2 PM. Shanxi's Sun Guixiu and Chang Shixi's skills were weak and unremarkable. Beijing's Chen Qing and Chen Xibao had good cooperation and average skills, but they were slightly better than Shanxi. Therefore, after two sets, Beijing won with a score of 6-1. The second singles match was the key to the victory or defeat of Beijing and Shanxi. Shanxi had already won a singles match in the morning, so the two sides competed fiercely. Shanxi's Wang Chunwei's skills were skilled, especially her backhand, and she was as calm as her sister Chunjing. Beijing's Huang Shannong's smashes were powerful, and her skills were quite impressive. There was a high possibility of winning this match, but because she was overly cautious, she missed good opportunities, and finally lost two consecutive sets with a score of 7-9, 3-6. Therefore, Shanxi eliminated Beijing with a score of 2-1 and secured a spot in the semifinals.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Works Hard and Defeats Hebei; Result: 2-1</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the match between Sichuan and Hebei, the situation was more tense. Sichuan's Bao Dajing's smashes were fierce, but Hebei's Cui Shuzhen also resisted fiercely. In the first set, Bao only won with a score of 6-4. In the second set, Bao sailed smoothly, while Cui had difficulty resisting. As a result, Bao won again with a score of 6-1.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) The doubles and second singles matches between Sichuan and Hebei were not played because one side forfeited. Sichuan only had two representatives participating, so of course both sides forfeited to Hebei, while Hebei and Beijing only had three players. Since the first singles match had already been played and the doubles match was stipulated by the conference, the second singles match also had to be forfeited to Sichuan. However, Sichuan had already won a singles match in the morning, so Sichuan eliminated Hebei with a score of 2-1 and immediately secured a spot in the semifinals.</p>

<h3>Women's Tennis Situation</h3>
<p>Men's Basketball</p>
<h3>The Whole Stadium Shakes as Beijing's Five Tigers Fight Valiantly to Defeat the Philippine Overseas Chinese; Result: 37-19; The Philippine Team Can't Handle Toughness; Hebei Tenaciously Defeats Fujian 47-29</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the two second-round men's basketball games starting at 9 AM on the 15th, the basketball court was packed with spectators, leaving no room to move. The basketball court was like a cauldron on the flat ground at the bottom, but this was the first grand occasion of the opening, because all four teams participating were strong teams. Especially the battle between Nanjing and the Philippine Overseas Chinese was the most attractive. Nanjing combined the tigers of the Military Academy and Qingguang teams, whose strength was not inferior to that of Hebei. The Philippine team could not handle toughness. Compared with the Beijing team, they inevitably paled in comparison. As a result, Nanjing defeated the Philippine Overseas Chinese 37-19, and Hebei defeated Fujian 47-29. The two teams, Beijing and Hebei, will meet in the semifinals, which will develop into an unprecedented great battle.</p>
<h3>Hebei Easily Defeats Fujian; Getting What They Want</h3>
<p>When the first game between Hebei and Fujian started, Fujian made a desperate effort to resist tenaciously, and the situation seemed average. However, Fujian committed four consecutive fouls, all by Ye Maofa alone. Therefore, Ye was fouled out of the game shortly after entering the court. Afterwards, Fujian slumped. Every member of Hebei was brave and good at fighting. Although they adjusted their lineup from time to time, they were always tense, getting what they wanted and handling the situation skillfully. The score soared, taking a 19-4 lead. Yang Xijue earned two points for Fujian, and then the score became 25-6. At the end of the first half, Hebei won 27-10.</p>
<h3>Smooth Sailing</h3>
<p>After the lemon break, Fujian took the initiative to attack, and their momentum was strong. Chen Zongbiao scored two consecutive baskets, and Yang Xijue and Wu Yicheng each made contributions. Hebei's Yin Hongxiang made wonderful contributions repeatedly, and the situation was quite balanced. However, the two sides made frequent adjustments, which relaxed the situation and reduced interest. Hebei had smooth sailing, always taking the lead, and the score difference was usually around twenty points. Although Fujian lost, their performance in the second half was commendable. Therefore, Xijue scored a lot of points. In the end, Hebei won 47-29. The referees were Shu Hong and Tong Furan.</p>

<h3>The Philippine Overseas Chinese Team Lost After a Hard Battle; Underestimating the Enemy</h3>
<p>The second game was between the overseas Philippine Overseas Chinese and Nanjing. With the enthusiastic support of the audience, the Nanjing players were tall, strong, and extraordinarily tenacious. In the last ten minutes, their accurate shots were unexpectedly wonderful. The Philippine team suffered from weakness. In terms of shooting, they had no confidence at all. The situation was completely different from the situation when they played against Jiangsu a few days ago. Jing Xian, Zhuang Huai, Li Gongyu, Wei Haiqing, and Wang Shixuan were the most outstanding. The Philippine team's Yang brothers were under surveillance and had little activity, and their shooting was inaccurate. Only one out of ten shots was successful, leading to a complete defeat. Beijing won 37-19 and started to compete for the championship. The Philippine Overseas Chinese thought that Nanjing's strength was average, so they sent the reserves to the court first to test Nanjing's strength, but they were controlled everywhere and had little activity. After Beijing won 6-1,</p>
<h3>The Situation Gradually Changes</h3>
<p>They were greatly terrified, so they sent the formal lineup to the court. From then on, the situation became tense, and the fight became more fierce. The Philippine team tried hard to advance, and Nanjing did not show any weakness, working hard and building little. Nanjing's defense was strict, and the Philippines had no chance to attack. Xian Zhuang Huai and Wang Shixuan repeatedly scored for Nanjing. Although the Philippines once advanced to 5-8, only three points behind Nanjing, they finally lost 8-17 in the first half. The Philippine team perked up and planned to retaliate in the second half, revealing their sharpness on the field. Lin Aoliu tried hard to win five points, and Yang Shuhui pounced into one point. The score once advanced to 15-18, 17-20, again only three points behind Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Aspirations Unfulfilled</h3>
<p>Thinking that it was not difficult to catch up, but Nanjing was unwilling to show weakness. In the blink of an eye, the situation suddenly changed again. Xian Li Gongyu threw accurately, which was so wonderful that it won a lot of cheers from the audience. The Philippine team was trapped in a difficult situation and had no choice. The Philippine Overseas Chinese, who came from overseas, were unfortunately eliminated, which was unavoidable. As a result, Nanjing won 37-19. Nanjing will face Shanghai and Hebei in the semifinals, which is very noteworthy.</p>

<h3>Second Round Results: Guangdong and Zhejiang Advance to the Third Week; Guangdong Wins Jiangsu 3-0; Zhejiang Wins Beijing 3-1</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the two second-round men's volleyball games at 3 PM on the 15th, (1) Guangdong defeated Jiangsu, with a result of 3-0. Guangdong won. (2) Zhejiang vs. Nanjing, with a result of 3-1. Zhejiang won.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Fights Valiantly but Is Defeated Miserably</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu team is the essence of a province, with members of Soochow as the backbone, supplemented by athletes from Datong Institute of Physical Education. In the preliminary round, they showed their talents. Before the start of the match with Guangdong, they were ambitious. In the opening, Guangdong's Su Zuyin served, showing politeness and yielding three points. Until the score was 3-5, the three generals in the front row started to kill, passing the ball to the net and killing it smoothly, which was very clever. The score became 7-7. The color people and others watching the battle on the stand shouted, "Again!" The ball unexpectedly poured into Jiangsu's front court. Guangdong 11, Jiangsu 8 points. Changing sides and fighting again, Jiangsu saw that the incoming ball was hard and fast, and the door was ineffective, the line was scattered and unbearable, and the failure to turn the rollers ended in failure. Guangdong killed Jiangsu with twenty-one to nine, causing fresh blood to flow. In the second game, Jiangsu desperately tried to recover the lost ground, but was impatient and chaotic, with continuous mistakes. Guangdong won eight points in one go. Afterwards, Guangdong's front row committed a net touch foul, and Jiangsu profited from the loophole. The first half was eleven to eight, with Guangdong still having the upper hand. The second half was one-sided, even more dangerous, ending with twenty-one to nine. In the third game, Jiangsu continued to attack tirelessly, jumping back and forth, unwilling to relax a step. The score was close to Guangdong, and the cheers were thunderous. Chen Rushu's serves were effective, and Cui Honghuan's pressure ball was powerful, but unfortunately there were not many opportunities, ending the game with twenty-one to eighteen. The overall result was three to zero, a miserable defeat for Jiangsu. The referee was Li Yunfei.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Skillfully Overcomes Strong Opponent</h3>
<p>In the preliminary round, Zhejiang defeated Hebei 3-0, and Nanjing defeated Henan 3-1. The strengths of the two teams were not far apart. However, Zhejiang had the tall and thin Zhang Zhengfu, who was skillful and conserved energy. In the first set, Zhejiang won 21-15. In the second set, Nanjing's front row focused on blocking, not wanting to attack, and the ball was not allowed to pass. Seeing Zhang, the tall player, pressing several times in a row, the set ended with a score of 21-10. Nanjing lost two sets in a row and lost heart. Knowing that not resisting was as grave an error as losing the three northeastern provinces, they issued an order, and their hidden troops rose up. In the first half of the set, they actually won 5-1. After switching sides, their morale was even higher, and they turned the set around with 21-19. In the third set, Nanjing's strength was insufficient and gradually weakened, while Zhejiang's skillful tactics returned. Zhejiang won the final point, with a score of 21-9. The overall result was 3-1, and Zhejiang obtained the right to the semi-finals.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Breaks Record Again in the 400-meter Relay Final—44.4 Seconds—</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) In the 1600-meter relay final, the participants included five teams: Guangdong, Shanghai, Beiping, Hebei, and Nanjing. Although Liaoning had previously won the first group in the preliminary round, Liu Changchun was unable to carry the team alone, so Liaoning forfeited the final. Of the five teams participating, Beijing failed. Guangdong occupied the second lane, Hebei the third, and Shanghai the fourth. The teams from Beiping, Shanghai and Guangdong started to pull ahead, and then Shanghai and Guangdong went neck and neck. However, during the third leg, Shanghai's selection of the baton was slow, and Guangdong moved ahead by three meters. Shanghai ultimately lost by a three-meter margin. Guangdong took first place, Shanghai second, Beijing third, and Beiping fourth. The result of 44.5 2/5 seconds broke the national record of 46.6 seconds. The four teams' selected athletes are as follows: (1) Guangdong: Zhong Lianji, He Peigen, Zhao Bingheng, Zhu Zhongxi; (2) Shanghai: Su Xiaoru, Dong Yinchu, Hao Chunde, Cheng Jinguan; (3) Beijing: Liu Yingjie, Lu Yulin, Ma Yu, Xu Yin; (4) Beiping: Zhang Kan, Song Shuzhang, Sun Yueming, Wang Qiang.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) Shanghai aircraft fly to Beijing to celebrate victory.

At 10 a.m. on the 15th, the three aircraft flew in formation, circling above the field. In the center was the yellow "Shanghai City," flanked by the blue "Shanghai School" and "Ningbo." The sound of the engines rumbled, and tens of thousands of spectators craned their necks to look up, applauding in welcome. Soon after, the three aircraft separated. "Shanghai School" and "Ningbo" rose straight into the sky to perform technical maneuvers, including loops and side spins. The crowd applauded like thunder, and cheers did not stop.</p>

<h3>Subsequent Match Results: Hong Kong Meets Strong Opponent, Wins After Hard Fight; Result is 3-1 Win Over Hunan; Hunan's Setting and Coordination are Poor; Beiping Misses Are Truly Powerful, Overcome Jiangsu 3-0</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) Women's volleyball preliminary rounds are over, now entering the subsequent match week. Two matches were held simultaneously on the morning of the 15th: (1) Hong Kong vs. Hunan; (2) Beiping vs. Jiangsu. The result was Hong Kong winning against Hunan 3-1 and Beiping winning against Jiangsu 3-0, obtaining the right to the semi-finals.</p>
<h3>Beiping's Great Victory Over Jiangsu—Three to Zero—Beiping's Generals Certainly Have Real Strength; Jiangsu's Soldiers are Very Soft</h3>
<p>In the Beiping women's volleyball preliminary round, they won 3-0, showing that the generals of northern China are indeed extraordinary. This morning, they faced Jiangsu in the subsequent round. Jiangsu is based in Wuxi and includes the iron volleyball generals of Suzhou. However, having had a bye, they had not participated in the preliminary round, so their strength was yet to be seen. From the start of the match, it was clear that they were very soft. They suffered a crushing defeat of 10-21 in the first set. In the second set, Yang Luyi scored a point with a spike, jumping up in the front row for a light kill. This was the most exciting performance from Jiangsu. However, the Beiping misses were ultimately a powerful force that shook northern China, so they did not relax their grip. They won the second set 21-16. In the third set, Jiangsu collapsed completely. Although they brought in reinforcements, their ammunition was exhausted and their generals were tired, so they were ultimately unable to recover. The score was 10-21. Beiping won three straight sets to secure the right to the semi-finals. The referee was Tan Tianpei.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong's Hard-Fought Victory Over Hunan—Three to One—Hong Kong Wins Due to Coordination; Hunan's Loss is a Pity</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong team, veterans of many battles, put on a very exciting performance in the preliminary round week, defeating Henan 3-2. Hunan, newly at war with Nanjing, also obtained the right to the subsequent round with a 3-1 victory. Their strength and record were quite notable. When two heroes meet, they naturally have to fight to the death. At 8:30, the battle began. Hong Kong's Zhu Jiaoxin raised his arm to serve, and the Hunan soldiers crouched to meet the front row. Su Jing, a strong general, aimed carefully and killed with a set over the net, actually landing the flower on the ground. The first record was made on the scoreboard. Hunan's Bao Shufang served weakly, and Hong Kong served again, passing flatly. In the first half of the set, the Hunan army won 11-9 first. In the second half of the set, the Hunan army held firm to the principle of defeating people with force and was not polite at all, killing forward. Although Hong Kong had been winning with coordination, they were now exhausted from running around. They lost 14-21. Hunan's voice was so loud that Shanghai player Miss Xue Zhijie and others stared blankly, exclaiming how fierce they were. In the second set, Hunan took advantage of the momentum and rushed forward, achieving 16-10 in one go, shaking all around. The people of Hong Kong were all born in the military, able to respond to the enemy without chaos. Ye Huiwen, Chen Mufang, and Zhu Jiaoxin blocked well, winning a point. However, the situation did not turn around. In the first half of the set, they were still at a disadvantage at 8-11. Changing sides, the Hong Kong team was not willing to easily lose their lifetime of glory, so at 15-17, they fought with all their might. Sure enough, in the blink of an eye, they immediately created a tie of 19-19. Luo Yue also made a final effort, setting a score for the set of 21-19. In the third set, Chen Chonglian served, and the front row on the opposite side rushed to meet the enemy, hastily touching the net. The second ball came, and Mai Yue dived to save it. The two sides engaged in close combat, setting, passing, and killing back and forth, and the score was close, with no major changes. In the first half of the set, Hunan was still in the lead at 11-10. After changing sides, the wind turned completely. Hong Kong's Chen Mufang scored six points in a row. The Hunan army had less experience and made no achievements. At 21-20, Hong Kong served three times in a row, and no one from Hunan tried to save, Hong Kong then won the fourth set 23-21. In the fourth set, Hunan served and scored a point. Hong Kong quickly chased, scoring six points in a row. Hunan's loss was all due to misunderstandings. In the first half of the set, Hong Kong was at 11, and Hunan at 5. Continuing the battle, the Hunan army's morale was low and eliminated at 21-14. The result was 3-1. In summary, Hunan's serves were powerful, and their spikes were strong, but their setting and coordination were not as good as the Hong Kong team's. Hong Kong's victory was due to their coordination.</p>

In the end, the Qiu-Lin team won 7-5.</p>
<p>Predictions for Men's and Women's Swimming Championships</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between Guangdong and Hong Kong; The Size of the Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>— Oldest</p>
<p>The pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide. It is entirely made of mosaic, clean and beautiful. It can accommodate nine people in a race at a time. It is the largest swimming pool in our country. On the two banks of the pool, in addition to the rest area for athletes, there are two square flat diving boards. The open space on both sides is more than ten feet wide. The grandstand is terraced, about two feet wide, half of which is cement and half is green grass, about sixty meters long. Each side has more than ten steps and can accommodate more than a thousand people. At one end of the pool are the changing room, shower room, office, and medicated water pool. Before entering the pool, one must wash their body and feet with medicated water, and their physical fitness must be inspected by the health department, which is extremely strict. It is a pity that there is no warm water shower after swimming, which is a shortcoming.</p>
<h3>Diligence in Practice</h3>
<p>As the swimming competition date approaches, starting on October 10th, swimmers from provinces and cities participate in timed practice from morning to night. The weather has been cold these days, and the athletes are calling out that it is too cold, but the Shi brothers practice the most diligently, twice a day, each time for more than an hour. They have succeeded because of this.</p>
<h3>Prediction of Strength</h3>
<p>According to recent practice results, (1) 1500-meter freestyle: (1) Shi Xingzhi, (2) Shi Xinglu (Liaoning), (3) Guo Zhenheng (Guangdong), (4) Tong Dayun (Shanghai), (5) Shi Jinpei (Guangdong)</p>
<p>(2) 50-meter freestyle: (1)(2)(3) Chen Zhenxing, Chen Qisong, and Liu Baoxi of Guangdong will compete fiercely. The results have not been outstanding due to the cold weather. It is predicted that first place will be 29 seconds, second place 30 seconds, third place 30.5 seconds. Guangdong's Wang Xiushan and Shanghai's Wen Jingling, Yu Xuebang, and Xu Heng are all hopeful for fourth place.</p>
<p>(3) 50-meter freestyle (women): Hong Kong's Yang Xiuqiong will definitely win first place. Her time will be within 33 seconds, so she is invincible. The individual championship for women will definitely belong to her. For second place, Guangdong's Chen Yuhui is estimated to be around 36 seconds. Hong Kong's Liang Yongxian, Liu Guiling, Yuan Peizhang, and Guangdong's Wu Shunying will compete for third and fourth places, with times around 37 seconds.</p>
<p>(4) 400-meter freestyle: Chen Qisong, Shi Xingzhi, and Hong Kong's Guo Zhenheng are hopeful for the top three places. Shi Xinglu and Zhou Dayun will compete for fourth place. The results will be around six minutes, which can break Huang Yuan's national record of six minutes and eight and eight tenths of a second.</p>
<p>(5) 100-meter backstroke: There are as many as 408 participants. Although Shanghai's Yang Yuanhua broke the record at the Shanghai Municipal Games with a time of one minute and twenty-nine seconds, Guangdong's Liu Baoxi and Shi Jinpei are hopeful for first and second place, with times around one minute and twenty-three seconds. For third and fourth place, Hong Kong's Guo Zhenheng, Shanghai's Yang Yuanhua, Guangdong's Chen Zhenxing, and Chen Qisong are</p>
<p>(6) 100-meter backstroke (women): Hong Kong's Yang Xiuqiong will definitely win first place. Guangdong's Yuan Peizhang and Hong Kong's Liu Guiling are in contention for second and third place. According to practice results, Yuan seems to be more promising than Liu, but Yuan is afraid of the cold. It depends on whether the weather is warm or not. Guangdong's Chen Yuhui and Shanghai's Xi Xiji are also hopeful for fourth place.</p>
<p>(7) 200-meter breaststroke: Yang Yuanhua set a record of three minutes and twenty-three seconds, and Hong Kong and Guangdong also achieved good results. So the champion will be Hong Kong's Guo Zhenheng with a time around three minutes. Wang Xinyaomin is around three minutes and six or seven seconds. Guangdong's Bao Li and Shanghai's Yang Yuanhua are in contention for third and fourth place, with times between three minutes and twenty seconds.</p>
<p>(8) 100-meter freestyle: (1) Chen Zhenxing, (2) Chen Qisong. Wang Xiushan, Liu Baoxi, Wen Jingling, and Yu Xuebang will compete for third and fourth place.</p>
<p>(9) 100-meter freestyle (women): (1) Yang Xiuqiong, (2) Chen Yuhui, (3) Wu Shunying. The time will be around one minute and twenty-five seconds. Hong Kong's Yang Xiuzhen and Shanghai's Chen Baoxuan are hopeful for fourth place.</p>
<p>(10) 200-meter breaststroke (women): (1) Yang Xiuqiong is guaranteed to win. Liu Guizhen, Yuan Peixian, Shanghai's Hu Qiyuan, and Guangdong's Liu Su are all in for a fierce battle. The time will be over four minutes.</p>
<p>(11) 200-meter relay is divided into two groups: one group is Guizhou, Hebei, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Fujian; the other group is Shandong, Hubei, Liaoning, Hunan, Beiping, and Hong Kong. The top two will be Shanghai and Guangdong. The third and fourth will be Hong Kong and Liaoning, but Hong Kong is more likely to be third.</p>

<h3>The Method of This Tennis Competition is Poor; Singles Players Cannot Also Play Doubles; The First and Second Singles Are Not Specified; Since the Start of the Competition, There Have Been Countless Forfeits; If There is Cunning, There is No Way to Handle It</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) The men's and women's tennis competitions are divided into singles and doubles groups. This method is not necessarily bad, but single players should also be allowed to play doubles. This point causes many inconveniences for units that lack talent or are limited by other reasons and cannot send many representatives. Therefore, since the start of the competition, there have been several forfeits every day. However, when the singles are divided one game apiece, the final victory must be determined in doubles. But when both sides have no other doubles players, both sides will inevitably forfeit. How will this group's victory or defeat be resolved? This is an extremely difficult problem, and the organizers did not consider it at the beginning, which has sown the seeds of disaster. It can be said to be extremely brainless. The negligence in handling affairs is even more obvious here. Also, since singles cannot also play doubles, the first and second singles players are not specified. If a player is clearly the first singles player but deliberately changes to the second singles player in order to be cunning, and the official second singles player is promoted to the first singles player, it is deliberately making the victory or defeat of the competition dependent on doubles. But on the one hand, there are no doubles players, and they can only forfeit. Thus, one side will naturally win. Although this is related to sportsmanship and is purely ideal, it is also a very possible event. If such a fact occurs, what will the organizers of the competition do? In short, it cannot be denied that the organizers of this competition lack experience.</p>
<h3>Batavia Requests Accommodation</h3>
<p>In this National Games tennis championship, eighteen units have participated from across the country and from overseas Chinese. Among them, the Batavia Overseas Chinese Tennis Team is the most eye-catching. Xu Chengji, a member of the team, is the current Java tennis singles champion. At the same time, Lin Xuyin, a member of the team, and Xu teamed up and also won the doubles championship. Their skills must be extraordinary. On the morning of the 12th, the team first met the Hubei team. Xu and Lin both won their singles matches against their opponents 3-0. Unfortunately, in the doubles match held in the afternoon, Xu and Lin were restricted by the committee. Since they had participated in the singles, they could not participate in the doubles, so they were unable to take to the court. The audience was very disappointed, and the players themselves were very dissatisfied. It is said that the team formally sent a written request to the competition committee that afternoon, asking for accommodation. The result is still unknown, but the games were originally held to promote sports and to observe the strengths of the nation's athletes. Therefore, the fair proposal of the Batavia team may not be completely ignored.</p>
<h3>The Appeal of Shanghai and Fujian Women's Basketball is Great; Soldiers Vie for Seats</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) This morning's women's basketball game between Fujian and Shanghai. The strength of both sides is unusually strong. The audience squeezed into all the gaps. On the southwest grandstand, two students from a certain political school and more than a hundred armed soldiers had a dispute over seats. The soldiers punched each other, and the order was disrupted for a time. The students knew they were at a disadvantage, so they jumped over the railing and fled east. The soldiers chased after them tightly, holding the students down and using whips and wooden sticks to beat them. The students' heads were broken and bleeding, and they shouted for help. The audience was furious and shouted "Catch the bandits!" The guards heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, with bayonets and pistols in hand, surrounding the hundred or so soldiers. Then, they all bowed their heads and listened to orders. The two officers in charge were taken to the headquarters tent near the entrance of the venue. Armed soldiers and police heavily guarded the outside of the tent to prevent accidents. Not long after, the headquarters of the 88th Division called and lightly released the two officers. A storm was quelled.</p>
<h3>Athletes Must Train Regularly</h3>
<p>The National Games have been held for six days, and Shanghai has won four championships in the men's track and field all-around competition and the women's track and field. This success is due to the concentration of talent and, more importantly, to the effectiveness of regular training. The Shanghai Diligence Bookstore has invited national sports experts to co-author a series of sports books, including: Zhang Heng's (Central University sports instructor) "Track and Field Training Method" (deluxe edition, two yuan); Wang Fudan's (Jiangnan Institute of Physical Education principal) "Track and Field Refereeing Method" (sixty cents); Hao Gengsheng's (Shandong University director of physical education) "Pentathlon and Decathlon Training Method" (ninety-five cents); Hitoimi Kinu’e's "Female Athletes Before the Competition" (ninety cents); Wang Fudan's "Cross-Country Running Training Method" (forty cents); Lu Xiangqian's (Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation chairman) "Race Walking Training Method" (sixty cents). Each book describes the training methods in detail and has many illustrations. They are essential reference books for sports instructors and athletes.</p>
<h3>Military Academy Students and Faculty from the Northeast Welcome Athletes from the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) The students and faculty from the Northeast at the Central Military Academy, at 1:00 PM on the 15th, welcomed the athletes from the Northeast and talked about the situation in their hometowns. They were all filled with grief and tears. The meeting ended at 5:00 PM. Athletes to the sports field.</p>
<h3>The Jiangxi Association in Beijing Welcomes Jiangxi Athletes; Enthusiasm and Sincere Encouragement</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Association in Beijing held a warm welcome for the Jiangxi athletes attending the National Games at 2:00 PM on the 15th in the back hall of the Jianggu Temple. About a hundred male and female staff and athletes attended. Chairman Zhong Lingxi reported on the purpose of the meeting. Tang Zengbi delivered a welcome speech. Then Chen Jianxiu, Zhou Fu, Gui Yongqing, Tang Shifeng, Zhang Housheng, Xiao Hanzhang, and Xiao Xiqing delivered speeches. Finally, the representatives of the delegation, Yu Yongzuo and Li Youxiang, gave replies. The enthusiasm was overflowing, and the encouragement was sincere. The meeting ended with a group photo and everyone had a good time.</p>
<h3>Fire Safety Equipment is Safe at the National Games</h3>
<p>The fire safety equipment at the National Games is very careful. In view of the fact that the fire extinguishers manufactured by the family workshops are different in structure from ordinary ones, the anchor pipe is equipped with a belt that can be tilted and fired straight into the flat top inside and the oil pool in the cellar, without leaking gas. The content is a thick-walled glass tube, straight to the bottom, with more capacity than usual. They have written a special letter to borrow fifty units for emergencies, praising their products as being suitable for use. The original letter is as follows: [The fire extinguisher manufactured by your company is well-made and effective, and has long been praised by the Chinese people. The association plans to build temporary sheds this time, mostly for the safety of the venue equipment, and plans to ask your factory to lend 50 fire extinguishers in case of emergencies].</p>

<p>Public Exhibition Cup</p>
<h3>YMCA Actively Prepares for International Handball Tournament; Old Court Converted to Standard Style; Member Ranking Competition to be Held</h3>
<p>Every year, the Shanghai YMCA organizes the Chinese Handball Team to compete against the Western team of the Western YMCA for the International Handball Public Exhibition Cup. This winter, it will begin again on November 23rd. The association, in light of the Chinese team's previous failures, believes that it was not due to a lack of skill or experience but rather due to differences in the field and rules. Therefore, it has invested heavily to convert the old court into a standard style. At the same time, member ranking competitions will be held on the standard court. In addition to the original ten members, more than twenty people are participating in the preliminary rounds, which is very popular. Everyone who is proficient in this sport is included. After the preliminary rounds, the winners Hua Fenggang, Yan Peiqiu, Cai Tongshou, Xia Zeren, Yuan Zongji, and Yan Zhaorong, along with the aforementioned ten members, will participate in the member ranking competition starting from the 23rd.</p>

<h3>Ma Jie-fu and Judge Lu</h3>
<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>Ma Jie-fu and Judge Lu, these two names, those who have read "Liaozhai" probably know them. The fact is this...</p>
<p>Ma Jie-fu and Yang Wan-shi were close friends. Wan-shi was naturally afraid of his wife, so afraid that even Ma Jie-fu couldn't stand it, so he gave him a dose of "Husband Rejuvenation Powder," and he indeed overcame his wife. Unfortunately, after the medicine wore off, Wan-shi still lived the life of a kneeling washboard.</p>
<p>Judge Lu and Zhu Er-dan were close friends. Er-dan's writing was too poor, so Judge Lu picked a clever seven-aperture heart in the underworld and replaced it for him, and indeed his writing improved greatly; Er-dan also disliked his wife's unattractive face, so Judge Lu picked an unparalleled face in the mortal world and replaced it for her, and indeed she became alluring.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that Ma Jie-fu's methods are not as good as Judge Lu's: one only teaches him to be excited for a while, and the result is that he is as weak as before; the other is a thorough reform, and the result is that the roots are cut off forever.</p>
<p>We Chinese people are suffering from a disease of weakness, and we happen to meet Ma Jie-fu, who only knows how to give him Rejuvenation Powder, but we have not met Judge Lu to change his heart and reform his face, resulting in a paper tiger that is completely defeated by the opponent.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Rejuvenation Powder we take is more and more than Yang Wan-shi: we took a dose on May 9th, a dose on May 30th, a dose on May 3rd, and recently, we took another dose on September 18th. As we continue to take it, civil officials declare unity; military generals send telegrams requesting battle; merchants claim to resist goods, and students are even more amazing, wearing military uniforms, carrying long guns, and becoming reserve soldiers. It's like Yang Wan-shi cutting off two pieces of meat from his wife with a knife and still not being relieved of his anger. But five minutes later, the effect of the medicine does not rush upwards but leaks downwards, and as a result, Yang Wan-shi still kneels in front of the washboard, and our civil officials, military generals, merchants, and students are still lifeless.</p>
<p>From now on, we must not take Ma Jie-fu's Husband Rejuvenation Powder anymore, but rather ask Judge Lu to change our hearts and reform our faces!</p>
<h3>Modern Ghosts</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>In these times, being a person certainly requires being "modernized." Speaking must be modern, decoration must be modern, and everything from daily life to food and drink must strive for modernity. Only then does one meet the qualifications of a "modern upper-class man and woman, a beautiful person." Otherwise, one is a "corrupt element," an "outdated person of the times." Therefore, in recent years, people have felt a modern craze. The word "modern" was once all the rage. Now it is being extended even further, and even being a ghost requires modernization. If you don't believe it, just look at the advertisement for XX Funeral Home published in the newspaper a few days ago. The content goes like this:</p>
<p>Artistic and magnificent coffins, each sold for洋X千X百X十X元 (a price in foreign currency). Funeral service fees: X百X十元 (another price). Purchasing a coffin alone is also acceptable: this coffin is carved from only two pieces of wood, exquisitely crafted, and modern in style, proving that it will never decay...</p>
<p>Using the title of "modern" on a coffin seems to be a first-time occurrence. One can certainly compose two lines of poetry: "Entering this coffin, one can be a modern ghost." One can also drop a few literary phrases: "Having exhausted beauty and goodness, one can be said to be happy within. There is no one who dies with eyes that will not close." Such modern and new-style coffins are of course for wealthy modern people to enjoy. Although one coffin accompanies the body and everything is over, what's the point of talking about being modern or not? However, Confucius also had the clear instruction of "worship as if they are present," showing future generations. This shows that people and ghosts should be equal: when a person is alive, they like to talk about being modern, and at night they still have to sleep on a modern, new-style bed. After death, they should also sleep in that modern, new-style coffin. Only then can it be considered "consistent from beginning to end, as if still alive even in death."</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's coffins: for thousands of years, they have adhered to old ways and do not know how to improve. Although the wood may be valuable, the form is outdated and without any beauty. The name is a coffin, truly rich in the color of "longevity," making people not want to look at it. Now it's good, coffins also need special improvement and talk about being modernized. I think once this trend starts, others will follow suit, and "modern coffin shops" are bound to spring up one after another. Various new-style coffins will be displayed in categories. Or open a "coffin exhibition" for people to visit. To be even more modern, simply have a "21-day big sale." When that time comes, who knows, the storefront might be like a marketplace, with crowds gathering!</p>
<h3>Ramblings on Cartoons</h3>
<p>— (Written by Qian Yun, Drawn by Lian Liang)</p>
<p>—Chinese Temperament—</p>
<p>On the street, a small vendor selling socks, because a customer bargained too low, went from showing anger on his face to scolding aloud. The customer, fearing trouble, turned around and quietly avoided him. The further he walked away, the louder the scolding became, probably afraid of not hearing it. Many bystanders giggled.</p>
<p>A Western policeman came along. He didn't have time to carry his bundle away and was grabbed and beaten. This was illegal. He silently endured the beating and then pleaded. Many bystanders giggled.</p>
<p>Finally, he was arrested and taken to the police station. After the dramatic end, the crowd had no more excitement to watch and lazily dispersed.</p>
<p>Initially, no one scolded the vendor for being fierce to the customer, and later no one interceded with the Western policeman. These bystanders simply observed from beginning to end. Giggling and laughing all the time.</p>

<h3>Record of Su You Viewing Treasures</h3>
<p>Tao Wang is a world-renowned tile of Chai Kiln, handed down through generations by Zhu Zhuping, a reclusive gentleman in Wuzhong, worth a thousand gold. There were few of them even in the Song Dynasty, who would have thought that many remained in the world. I read the gentleman's catalog, with inscriptions by contemporary figures: "The noble recluse is poor and frugal, I am invited to appreciate the treasure leisurely, I move the lamp and stroke it repeatedly, surpassing the view of the setting sun over the river." In my humble view, how can its beauty be exhausted in this alone! Today I am fortunate to feast my eyes, thanks to the introduction of Ms. Zhao Hanying, a renowned expert in epigraphy. Truly, this trip has not been in vain.</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Sour Feelings Still Offer Blessings in the Face of the Present, Hurried Military Life Secretly Shifts Troops</p>
<p>The mules and horses in the army camp also have a keen sense of the arrival of war. When the swift wind sweeps across the sky, the loud neighing of the horses has a somewhat frightening undertone. Zhao Ziqiang, upon hearing this sound, felt a kind of indescribable emotion in his heart. He felt even more that his hasty departure, leaving his old father in Haidian, solely to deal with the Yang family mother and daughter, was a matter of his own self-inflicted trouble. He should have discussed it with his father first to put his mind at ease. Now was a good time to take a trip. Although two platoon leaders had left the camp, his limited hours of travel would probably not cause any delays. So he greeted the sergeant and quartermaster, and walked out of the camp. At this time, the sun was setting on the western mountain peak, only a dozen feet high. The boundless wheat field was painted with a golden ray of sunlight. The southeast wind on the plains was no longer so gentle, blowing on people in the setting sun, feeling somewhat chilly. Looking at the small houses in the distance, they seemed to be sinking into the mainland. A person walking on the road, the soles of his shoes making a rustling sound on the lime road. But when a person walks alone, this sound not only does not add to the liveliness but adds a lot of loneliness. Zhao Ziqiang thought, "I plan to walk this road every day after getting married. But that's just wishful thinking. What's the point of being a soldier? One's body belongs to others, and one's life also belongs to others. Perhaps walking this road today will be the last time." Thinking of telling his father these thoughts, guessing how sad he would be; telling Yang Guizhi these thoughts, what would she do? Women's tears are easily... I'm afraid she would faint from crying! No, maybe she would hate me for not shedding a single tear. Alas! When I see them, how can I express these bitter feelings? The more he thought, the slower his pace became, only the wind blowing through the wheat seedlings, rustling, stirring the loneliness in his soul. Suddenly, a burst of bugle sound came from behind. He abruptly stopped. He would not go home. (213)</p>

<h3>General Mobilization of Laughter</h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>Pots of the same origin do not sympathize with each other, but those of the same kind injure each other</p>
<p>Once, at the launching ceremony of a warship, Mrs. So-and-so, the wife of a certain minister, was invited to perform the bottle-breaking ceremony. This lady had received an education and was always ashamed of showing off. Breaking a champagne bottle in front of the public was not mentioned in the Biographies of Exemplary Women or Rules for Women's Chambers, so of course, she was ashamed of showing off. Since the lady refused to participate in the bottle-breaking ceremony, the minister had no choice but to send a female employee to represent the lady in performing the bottle-breaking ceremony. This female employee was a delicate red flower vase. She was very happy to accept this modern mission and participate. When she returned after breaking the bottle, a male employee who often told jokes said to her with a smile, "The red flower vase breaks the champagne bottle, it is not sympathizing with pots of the same origin, but injuring those of the same kind." Those who heard it laughed loudly, and the red flower vase's face turned red, all the way to her ears.</p>
<p>The exploited calligrapher and painter</p>
<p>Once a calligrapher and painter becomes famous, many relatives and old friends try to exploit them, either paying half the price or nothing at all. Occasional exploitation is understandable, but the most hateful thing is doing it again and again, endlessly, making it difficult for the calligrapher and painter to comply. Calligraphers and painters call this kind of exploitation "overstepping." If they keep overstepping, the painter often inscribes a couplet for them, embedding the poetic phrase "transcending the image." When the painter paints for them, he often draws a large water pot, with a glimpse of a dipper handle protruding from the water pot. These are all meant to be "singing to the zither," hoping that they will not overstep again after this overstepping. It is said that someone asked someone to paint an ancient beauty, specifying ten dollars, but when it came to paying the advance fee, he only wanted to pay five dollars. The painter insisted on painting a concubine Xu showing half her face. The man was displeased and said, "There are many ancient beauties, why only paint this concubine Xu with half her face made up?" The painter smiled and said, "The fee you paid is also a half-face makeup." Also, someone asked someone to paint a fan without paying a penny. The second time he asked that person to paint a fan again. That person wrote a Tang poem, omitting four words. It wrote: "Last year today, in this door, peach blossoms reflected each other in red: I don't know where to go? Peach blossoms still smile in the spring breeze." The man said, "Sir, you're wrong. The second line omits the words 'human face', and the third line also omits the words 'human face'." The calligrapher smiled and said, "So you still want a face? I thought you didn't want a face either time, so I omitted two human faces for you."</p>
<p>The Nude Movement of Peanuts</p>
<p>Recently, the nude movement has not been accomplished. Not to mention that people have a sense of shame, even the peanuts without a sense of shame, after being stripped of a coat, still have a tight-fitting red shirt. They are unwilling to strip completely. There is also a kind of white peanut that is stripped completely naked: but it is easy to get damp, easy to reduce the fragrance, and not as palatable as the peanut with a shirt on. Therefore, the nude movement of peanuts is largely in a state of failure. Now that August has arrived, sugar-roasted chestnuts are on the market. The chestnuts from Liangxiang are very open-minded girls, with a light twist, the outer shirt and underwear are all stripped clean. I ate a local chestnut the other day, stripped of its outer shirt. Don't think you can strip off its underwear. Later, I hardened my wrists and reluctantly stripped it off, pinching off a layer of the chestnut's flesh. I said: This chestnut refuses to strip off its underwear, willing to have its skin shattered, it has the attitude of a chaste woman in ancient times, I am disrespectful.</p>

<p>In addition, omissions are unavoidable. I have less interest in this kind of publication, so the investigation may not be as thorough, and various quarterly graduation publications of Chinese medicine schools are also not included.</p>
<p>Except for the first item, National Medicine Review, which is a special awakening of the youth, a new public opinion of national medicine, all the other nineteen kinds of old medical publications were produced to oppose the new medicine. Because these publications were almost all published after 1928. That year, at the Central Health Conference, someone proposed to limit the production of old medicine, so publications sprung up for a time, making resistance propaganda. In places with more new medicine, they also had more publications. As for the writers, most of them were those who claimed to be communication factions and Chinese medicine school factions. (Making resistance) It seems that after reading a few superficial books on physiology and hygiene, and some pharmaceutical factory brochures, they saw all the new medicine at a glance, immediately launched a general attack, eloquent and arrogant, but in reality, full of fallacies. On one hand, they were considered wild fox Zen by the conservative faction of old medicine, and on the other hand, they were not pleasing to anyone. Therefore, some of them often rose and fell quickly, and finally stopped publishing. Some were edited by more conservative people, mostly publishing proven prescriptions and ancient cases, making business calls, clearly shouting that medicine cannot be abolished, for the livelihood of the old medicine community. This was also straightforward and honest. The most wonderful group of merchants simply used publishing to advertise and solicit business, with the tone of "While I am lucky for ten years, come and see a doctor early." When their career was thriving, they also stopped writing. If you ask what kind of "scientific" articles and "communication faction" communication methods were published in these publications, I am limited in space here, and my bird's-eye view has ended with the five chapters of the main text. Now, let me just extract some famous quotes below as their representatives, so that readers can hold their stomachs after the depression, which is my final speech.</p>

<p>In addition, Xingfu Bao widely introduces single prescriptions, Shijie Yibao talks a lot about plague test recipes, and regardless of whether there is isolation, Yunti Qiao's various bacterial theories are colorful and very interesting.</p>
<h3>Discussions on Jiao Yitang's Letter to the Nation Regarding the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Using silk and tea as an analogy, the Chinese medicine industry's rice bowl is shrinking and breaking day by day. It can be predicted that it will inevitably decline. At the same time, the number of people who rely on the medicine industry for a living is increasing. However, besides using scientific methods to revitalize the silk and tea industries and the methods I have proposed to save the declining industry, what other way out is there? My rescue methods were published on the first page, number 84, of the Social Medical Gazette, which was the special issue on domestic drugs published on February 16th of this year. The article [The Fundamental Work of China's Drug Problem] advocated four measures: first, replacing foreign drugs; second, manufacturing raw materials; third, conducting scientific research on Chinese drugs; and fourth, observing and verifying Chinese drugs. If we diligently advance along the scientific path, why should we fear increasing costs and unemployment? Alas, Mr. Jiao! As long as you have a clear goal and work hard towards it, you don't have to worry about not having proper solutions. You can always remedy losses and prevent malpractices. Why insist on reversing course and taking a dead end?</p>
<p>Therefore, in my opinion, whether from an academic perspective, a doctor allocation perspective, or a national economic perspective, abolishing national medicine clearly has great benefits and no drawbacks.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: [The empiricism of national medicine constantly presents facts to people, which clearly has its material basis. As long as we use scientific methods to explain it, it will naturally become a systematic discipline.] According to what I said above, the empiricism signboard of national medicine is a false new title. The facts presented, when explored from a theoretical perspective, cannot escape the realm of "lucky coincidence." National medicine, which lacks material civilization progress, naturally has no material basis. Explaining it using scientific methods is like an old village woman wearing high heels, becoming a world monster, and is not worth talking about as an academic discipline.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao, science certainly needs a system, but having a system does not necessarily mean it can masquerade as science. The old astrology, medicine, divination, and the theories of the Five Elements have been passed down through generations, with everyone singing the same tune. We cannot say it has no system, but it lacks a scientific basis. Therefore, in modern times, it cannot be considered an academic discipline. Your entire national medicine is already irreparably broken and has declared its demise in the midst of calls for [organizing it in a scientific way]. Even Mr. Jiao cannot but admit that a part of metaphysics should be abandoned. But whether the remaining scales and claws after the shattering and demise can be accommodated in the scientific world depends on the results of future research by scientists. If the results are good, they can certainly survive; if the results are not good, they will certainly perish together. The fate of national medicine is just like this, and what can be hoped for is only this. The only way we can promote national glory is to do this. Therefore, those who want to do their part for national medicine can only encourage scientists to research it. This is the only way out for the remaining scales and claws after the shattering and demise. Without starting with research, and superficially using a bit of scientific knowledge to interpret things in a far-fetched way, no matter how systematic it becomes, it will be useless. Mr. Jiao's proposal is completely for the problem of your national medicine practitioners, setting a short-sighted and delaying tactic; it is not for the issue of academics, planning for a permanent existence, or far-sighted planning.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: [It is unbearable that the government does not pay deep attention to it, and would rather allow Western countries to establish Chinese medicine lectures and promote research. In the domestic education system, there is no place for national medicine.] Mr. Jiao, you need to understand! It's not that national medicine has no place in the education system, it's that metaphysics has no place in the education system. Outside of world medical science, there is absolutely no possibility for the existence of national medicine, so of course it has no place. There are now several private national medicine schools. Please, Mr. Jiao, take out their lecture notes and announce whether they are suitable for modern education or not. The reason why national medicine cures diseases is, of course, inexplicable. Taking a step back, even if you know the reason, according to Mr. Jiao's words, you cannot tell others. Then, standing on the podium, you can only look at the students. How can you educate the youth? Mr. Jiao! Western countries establish Chinese medicine lectures in the hands of scientific physicians, to digest Chinese medicine into scientific medicine, as a branch of scientific medicine. Your national medicine schools advocate putting the power of scientific organization in the hands of metaphysicians, to attach science to the surface of metaphysics, and to be independent outside of scientific medicine. Western countries only allow scholars who have completed scientific medical training to become graduate students, and the instructors are even above them. Your national medicine schools advocate having national medicine practitioners with no scientific literacy decorate the scientific facade, and the leaders are even below them. Western countries do not establish separate Chinese medicine schools outside of medical schools, nor do they have Chinese medicine figures outside of physicians. Your national medicine schools advocate opening up a separate position in the education system, and having Chinese medicine figures outside of scientific medicine. Western countries are completely about theoretical research. Your national medicine schools are completely about business exclusion. The goals, behaviors, strategies, and backgrounds are completely different. It's embarrassing that you, sir, brought them up as an analogy.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: Repeatedly in terms of business, national medicine's treatment of diseases cannot but be said to belong to hygiene, but the hygiene administrative organs have no officials in charge of national medicine. When problems arise, they arbitrarily teach personnel who do not understand national medicine to solve them. For example, two or three months ago, the Shanghai National Medicine Association and the Shanghai National Medicine Branch had a dispute and appealed to the Executive Yuan, which planned to transfer it to the Ministry of Health for review. Medical science is indeed a matter of hygiene, but the Chinese Ministry of Health does not recognize national medicine at all, so how can it review it? When the Legislative Yuan passed the Western Medicine Regulations, the health authorities declared that they would soon propose national medicine regulations, but the regulations have not been drafted for a long time. The central government, recognizing the urgency of managing national medicine, first established the Central National Medicine Hall in the 20th year of the Republic [1931]. Subsequently, in June of this year, it drafted national medicine regulations. Xiang Fei</p>
<p>For example, the Central Political Conference has strictly prohibited the premature</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>announcement of cases that have not been passed. I don't know what means the Tianjin Dagongbao Medical Supplement used to publish the draft in advance and distort it, saying that the establishment of the National Medicine Hall undermines the health administration system. The National Medicine Hall's undermining of the health administration system is indeed as said, but it is not known that China's health administration system is not perfect. Not only is the health administration system imperfect, but the education system is also not complete. The mission of the National Medicine Hall is to remedy the shortcomings of the education system in terms of academics, and to remedy the shortcomings of health administration in terms of business.] Since Mr. Jiao understands that national medicine's treatment of diseases belongs to hygiene, you should hand over the management of your national medicine completely to the Ministry of Health. Why use this destructive method? The Ministry of Health has no responsible officials. You, sir, can advise and propose that they add them. Before national medicine is completely abolished, it should naturally be managed. The national medicine regulations have not been drafted for a long time. You, sir, can urge them. Why use this destructive method? Hygiene and education are imperfect. You, sir, are also in the government, also in the central government. You should wholeheartedly be loyal and help them, make up for the shortcomings, and reach a perfect state. Why gloat and establish another institution to undermine them and create a political farce for power and profit? According to Mr. Jiao's opinion, the shortcoming of the Ministry of Education is only that it does not teach medical schools to add national medicine lectures. If Mr. Jiao believes that there are capable people in the Western medical community, then as long as your national medicine practitioners have the courage and ability to take on this lecture, I will definitely take on the responsibility of petitioning and requesting them to establish national medicine lectures to employ your national medicine practitioners as professors. But you must not walk into the laboratory, see the microscope, test tube, and various excellent instruments, be stunned and speechless, and make a joke. The shortcoming of the Ministry of Health is only that the national medicine regulations have not been drafted for a long time and that there are no responsible officials. Regarding this, our Chinese Medical Association has already submitted a memorial to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Central Political Conference, urging them to draft these regulations as soon as possible. At that time, responsible officials will naturally appear. Those who want to be officials may as well recommend one or two people to go in and take a seat, and they can naturally review the problems that arise in national medicine. I think there is a very correct path to take. Why establish another institution to destroy the administrative system? It's really incomprehensible.</p>
<p>In this wonderful passage of Mr. Jiao, suddenly it is unbearable that the government does not pay deep attention, and suddenly the central government is very urgently managing national medicine. May I ask, is the central government the government? Is the government the central government? It seems that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health belong to the government but not to the central government, and the National Medicine Hall belongs to the central government but not to the government, revealing the weakness that policies come from multiple sources and things have no direction. No wonder people laugh at it as an unorganized country. It seems that Mr. Jiao, who is the chairman of the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee, should not say such a thing!</p>
<p>Also, the word "Western medicine" is extremely inappropriate. Scientific medicine has now become a global, universally accepted discipline. Where are there east, west, north, and south to distinguish? If we trace its origin, why is the solar calendar that we follow today not called the Western calendar, but instead called the National calendar? Why are the armies carrying guns, cannons, airplanes, and warships not called Western armies? The postal service completely imitates the West. Why not call it Western Post? Why not invite the old-fashioned private postal bureaus of the people to come out and call them National Post? The legal system has completely become Western-style. Why not call it Western Law? Why not invite the old gentlemen of criminal law and money shells to come out and call them National Law? Why not call mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. in education by their old names from the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, and call them Western Learning? Why is the old name from the Guangxu period being restored only for the term "Western medicine"? To be honest with the people, the original name of the Western Medicine Regulations of the Ministry of Health was Physician Regulations. When it reached the Legislative Yuan, the word "physician" was suddenly changed to the extremely nonsensical "Western medicine." This is because there were a group of narrow-minded national medicine practitioners working as officials in the Legislative Yuan, who made such a joke. They had already occupied a place for national medicine outside of scientific medicine, at least to a limited extent, venting their depression and pleasing their hearts in this name, regardless of whether it was sensible or not, and making the most of the power they wielded today. Alas, Mr. Jiao! Learning requires real ability and strength. Relying on false propaganda and cunning deception, even if you deceive the eyes and ears for a while and gain a day's victory, it is only the setting sun reflecting its light. The future only has the word "extinction" waiting for you. Adding a hundred "national" characters is useless. The strength of science is expanding day by day. Adding a hundred "Western" characters cannot suppress it. Zhuangzi said it well, [The name is the guest of the reality. Shall I be a guest?]</p>
<p>Furthermore, I also have an mimeographed copy of the National Medicine Regulations, and the person who gave it to me said that it was obtained from the branch, and it was easy to get. The Dagongbao probably didn't get it by any means! I have discussed it to this point. Looking at Mr. Jiao's original text, there are only two hundred or so words left, and it is becoming more and more irrational. They can all be easily solved by following the discussions above. I will stop writing here. …(End)</p>
<h3>A Sincere Advice to Those Aspiring to Reform Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>— Zhou Sha</p>
<p>After I discussed old medical education, mentioning [A high-achieving student from a Chinese medicine school wrote a letter to Mr. Yu Yunxiu, expressing admiration and taking him as a teacher], Mr. Zhou Sha sent me a letter, stating that he was the one who wrote to Mr. Yu and that he agreed with my arguments, believing that they keenly saw the evils of the old medical community. He also attached a manuscript and asked me to reprint it. The writing is clear, and the views are outstanding. It is admirable. The original text was published in the fourth issue of the National Medicine Review. The authors of that book are mostly fresh and insightful like Mr. Zhou. But those who have received education in Chinese medicine schools, my country's old medicine, originally relied on mysterious and general theories, and were attached to the Confucian education of respecting antiquity to serve the world. Now, new middle school students enter speculative Chinese medicine schools. Let alone the far-fetched and illogical nature of their theories, which is rejected by young people who have received mathematics, physics, and chemistry education, even their training in studying the ancients will inevitably conflict with the reading methods that have been influenced by new literature. It is no different than leading a clever child into the backstage of a magician and forcing them to perform alchemy for the public. Is that possible? National Medicine Review is a sketch and review of the backstage of old medicine. Haha. The younger generation is to be feared. Gentlemen, rest. Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>The Chinese medical industry is a mixture of old and new, with right and wrong indistinguishable, and absurd and bizarre phenomena can be heard almost everywhere. Although it is due to the lack of unified medical administration, the immaturity of public intelligence is also a major reason. Thus, the so-called problem of reforming Chinese medicine arises, and the proponents of this problem can be roughly divided into two factions. The former is restorationist, and the latter is completely reformist. The former faction mostly consists of non-scientists who claim to be the intellectual class, believing that the history of Chinese medicine is thousands of years old, and there must be values that cannot be erased. Therefore, they vigorously advocate preservation and have the so-called slogan of [scientizing old medicine]. In fact, this faction is full of muddled metaphysicians. Non-scientists do not understand the general trend of world evolution and the degree of scientific development, so they publish these seemingly plausible remarks. It is really a mistake. The latter faction mostly consists of scientists, scholars with clear minds who are not bewitched by metaphysics. Mr. Yu Yunxiu can be taken as a representative of this faction. Mr. Yu has a full understanding of the doctrines of old medicine, and his criticisms of old medicine are completely based on science, seeking truth from facts, with not a single word being a castle in the air. However, his remarks are inevitably too激昂 because he wants to awaken those ignorant and undiscriminating people, (but it was also given to Mr. Yu by the old doctors. The author absolutely does not agree.) and aroused the backlash of the old doctors, even saying that Mr. Yu is fighting for the rice bowl. The absurdity of this kind of argument, clear-headed people can of course see at a glance that it is useless language based on no academic theory and can be ignored. However, one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark in response, which can greatly hinder the bright future of China's medical industry and cannot but be debated. Because as long as non-scientific old medicine and old drugs exist for one day, there will be one more obstacle to China's entire medical industry. Therefore, for the sake of the health of our Chinese nation and for the future of the entire Chinese medical industry, we must do our best to criticize the remarks that maintain absurd and bizarre old medicine. If anyone thinks that advocating scientific medicine is selling the country: advocating old medicine is preserving national essence, then this person's brain has been poisoned to a very deep degree. Since these people are so muddled, why should we still earnestly advise them? Because they and we are both members of the Chinese people, we have to speak loudly to open their confusion. Although it may not be a good thing to improve many domestic products, it is impossible for these muddled scholars who advocate improving Chinese medicine to rely solely on the knowledge gained from a few books to improve it. We can boldly say that the result is [equal to zero]. Without using science as a tool to improve it, no matter how great your abilities are, it will not help in practice. The author does not dare to rashly agree with the so-called scientific old medical reformers. Because I feel that their remarks are not enough to accomplish anything, but more than enough to spoil things: they are drugs that paralyze young people's thoughts. Therefore, I do not overestimate myself and offer some opinions to those who aspire to reform Chinese medicine, and hope to be corrected!</p>
<p>Regarding the entire Chinese medical industry. In this deformed China, it should be discussed from the new and old aspects: The most obvious aspect of the new is the lack of talent; the harm of lack of talent is that the new power (the power of scientific medicine) cannot develop. The old forces are prone to grow, and this is mutually causal. Because the new forces cannot develop; therefore, the old forces are prone to grow. Because the old forces grow more easily, the new forces can only develop less. This situation is not fabricated by the author facing the wall. Anyone who pays a little attention to the state of Chinese medicine can probably know it? (Please refer to Pang Jingzhou's article Shanghai Medical Panorama in the Last Ten Years, published in Shenbao Medical Weekly) In the new aspect, as long as we have the determination and strength, we can always reach the realm of our ideals. However, the old aspect is not the case. A slight negligence in the argument can easily lead astray, making countless promising young people wander and hesitate without knowing where to go. Because of this reason, the so-called problem of reforming old medicine is necessary for us to review.</p>
<p>We will not do the so-called work of improving old medicine, but if we want to do this work, then at the very least we must have the following six conditions. Otherwise, it will naturally waste a lot of valuable brain cells without receiving the slightest effect. Not only is there no effect, but there is also the possibility of hindering the development of [the entire Chinese medical industry]!</p>
<h3>(I) Stance</h3>
<p>If someone asks me: [Where should we stand to study the good and bad of old medicine, in other words, what attitude should we use to study its good and bad? [Then I must answer him like this: [We should stand on the scientific stance and use scientific means to study the good and bad of old medicine. ] We must know that not standing on the scientific stance to study old medicine will produce various mistakes. Such as the so-called [improving national medicine] by old doctors, he fundamentally divides medicine into geographical boundaries, so if someone says that old medicine should be abolished, he will angrily scold you [patriotic, not knowing how to use it. China has many domestic drugs and many doctors and pharmacies that rely on domestic drugs to make a living. How can he maintain his livelihood? Mr. Tan Cizhong sometimes cannot help but publish such remarks, I weep for the future of China. ] and other laughable words. This is what happens when the stance is wrong. Otherwise, they would never say such short-sighted words. If we stand on the scientific stance, it is not the case. This thing is in accordance with science and beneficial to modern times, then it is allowed to exist. Otherwise, it is restorationist, not in accordance with science, no matter whether it is the law of [ancient and modern China and foreign countries], we must kick it down and do not let it leave a little bit of residue in the world. In short, live if it is in accordance with science, die if it is not in accordance with science, if those who publish non-scientific and restorationist remarks: whether it is our stern father. Or close friends, respected teachers, we must criticize it and overthrow it according to science, the so-called [I love my teacher, I also love the truth. ] is. Comrades! Don't forget this sentence! Because in the scientific universe there is only truth and falsehood, not good and evil, and moreover, doing scholarship is incumbent, isn't it? Remember!</p>
<h3>The General State of Latent Tuberculosis and Its Benefits to the Human Body (I)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshu</p>
<p>The general public often over-fears pulmonary tuberculosis, thus causing the so-called phthisiophobia. However, in recent years, based on autopsies and [tuberculin] reaction calculations, more than 90% of people have pulmonary tuberculosis. Of these 90%, only</p>
<p>The average is latent tuberculosis. For the people of the country who do not yet understand the pathology and recuperation of tuberculosis, I am now the general state of latent tuberculosis and its benefits to the human body. From the lower collection of my translation of the lung disease recuperation teaching rules, I will first extract a paragraph for the public to view.</p>
<h3>The General State of Latent Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>The state of latent tuberculosis. The author intends to describe it in a little more detail in this section. The meaning of so-called latent tuberculosis is threefold. Readers should be able to understand it after reading it.</p>
<p>(1) Once infected with tuberculosis, it is fully treated due to treatment and health maintenance. The tuberculous lesions in the lungs are surrounded by the increase of connective tissue to form hard knots. However, a few viable tuberculosis bacteria still remain in the center. (The resistance of tuberculosis bacteria is extremely strong, as described in Section 19 of the upper collection.) However, it is difficult to know how long these tuberculosis bacteria will survive from external examination. Although many years have passed, if the body's defense force is greatly reduced, the disease will inevitably recur. This is the so-called recurrence of lung disease. There are no symptoms, and the body is obese, thinking that it is fully treated and very relieved. Because of not maintaining health, the body unknowingly becomes thinner. Fever gradually occurs. The previous lung disease gradually recurs. Or it is caused by sudden hemoptysis. Or lung disease recurs due to other serious illnesses. This is because the health maintenance during the lung disease era was good, but the health maintenance after the recovery period was insufficient. It is really regrettable. Therefore, from the perspective of a doctor, strictly speaking, those who have suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis once cannot be said to be fully treated for a long time in their lives. There are also those who have fully recovered because all tuberculosis bacteria have died, but it is difficult to guarantee that each person is like this. In other words, patients after the recovery period are actually a kind of so-called [latent tuberculosis] throughout their lives. From this point of view, the health maintenance method after the recovery period is really important.</p>
<p>(2) Although the period of formal pulmonary tuberculosis has not been experienced, I do not know how tuberculosis is infected. Tuberculosis bacteria are latent in a certain part of the body. Various symptoms occur that are slightly different from true lung disease. Often, one does not feel that one has tuberculosis at all. This is the so-called true latent tuberculosis. Most of those with weak bodies in childhood and adolescence belong to this state. Later, most of them become true pulmonary tuberculosis. It is difficult for ordinary doctors to diagnose this with general diagnostic methods. If you look at it with the eyes of a specialist, you can understand it at a glance. The so-called lung disease candidates or teenagers with lung disease are mostly in this category. It can be known by the [tuberculin] skin reaction test showing a clear reaction. Now, let's briefly talk about the symptoms that are easily known from the outside. Such as thin body. Although taking a lot of nourishment does not make the surface fat. Pale complexion. No energy. Often easily tired due to trivial matters. And easily suffer from palpitations and hyperactivity. Easily suffer from colds. After suffering from a cold. Difficult to cure after a long time. Easily get fever and cough. Sometimes night sweats. Easily get chest pain and a feeling of pressure in the chest. The stomach and intestines are weak and the appetite is lacking. In women, it is often accompanied by amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea. This is in the world or a part of the doctors. For this kind of latent tuberculosis patients. Most people commonly regard them as anemia, neurasthenia, gastrointestinal disease, gynecological disease. Although considerable treatment can be applied. But it does not take effect for a long time. Because anemia, neurasthenia, gastrointestinal disease, and gynecological disease are only its appearance. And the root is actually latent tuberculosis. If you do not apply the treatment for latent tuberculosis, it is only natural that it cannot be fully cured. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>After the Transformation</h3>
<p>— Ou Bi</p>
<p>It should be the time for transformation: your consciousness tells you so, and your environment forces you so. Thus, you transform. You discard all sighs that should not be sighed, tears that should not be shed. You have a new life. You are becoming a meaningful person, like George Sand.</p>
<p>Now, the first step of your work is to deeply study art, because art is the reflection of life, the crystallization of human suffering. After thoroughly studying art, you must bravely embark on the perilous path of life, singing generously, regarding death as homecoming, carving a path of blood from the midst of thorns and wild beasts for the sake of all humanity, to alleviate their suffering and tragically complete your own tragic life.</p>
<p>However, first, you must study the art that reflects your life. To study art, you must go to [Nanguo], because in [Nanguo], there is the yearning of your genius, the illusion of your ideal.</p>
<p>Naturally, when you decided to leave Shanghai and go to [Nanguo], you felt a nameless sense of melancholy, because [Haishang] is where you lingered, just as you are attached to West Lake. West Lake has tender affection, but [Haishang] has the vigor of resolute struggle; West Lake has the beauty of mountains and rivers, but [Haishang] has the majestic beauty of machinery; West Lake has... [Haishang] has... But what about [Nanguo]? Will you embark on your path of wandering again in this temporary respite? What kind of impression will [Nanguo] give you? Will it give you light, or...?</p>
<p>So you hesitate again, you waver again.</p>
<p>But in a flash, you say to yourself: What is there to hesitate about? What is there to waver about? Besides death, what else could there be? So you quickly organize your books and check your clothes as if you were determined to die.</p>
<p>Thus, like a warrior going to martyrdom, you march heroically to [Nanguo], to study the art of relieving human suffering and completing your own tragic life.</p>
<h3>After [Feeling the Past]</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>I still have a little more to write. But let me state beforehand that this is triggered by Mr. Shi Zhicun's words, but it is not written for him. In my original manuscript, I often mentioned the name of "Ge Chun", but when it was printed, it often turned into the word "[Mou]," or the common symbol "[XX]" for all the names of wealthy people, dangerous words, and vulgar terms for reproductive organs. I hope that some of the words in this article will not change like this, to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>What I want to say now is: it is difficult to speak, and it is not easy not to speak. Those who wield the pen must always write articles, and once they write articles, they inevitably invite disaster. The water of the Yellow River attacks the weak dikes, so women with exposed arms and young people who write wrong characters become objects of ridicule. They are truly without strength or courage, and can only endure, just like villagers who go to the Shanghai Concession and have no choice but to be called "[Ah Mu Lin]".</p>
<p>However, some are wronged. Just to give an example, there is Mr. Liu Bannong's [Self-Annotated and Self-Approved] [Tonghua Zhidoutang Poetry Collection] in the 26th issue of [The Analects], a collection of doggerel poems. When Peking University was recruiting students, he was a grader. He found a ridiculous misspelling on a Chinese paper and wrote a poem about it. Those people who were criticized were so distressed that they wanted to burrow into the ground, those recent middle school graduates. Of course, he is a professor, and everything he points out cannot be wrong, but I think there is still room for discussion in some cases. There is a [Self-Annotation] in the collection that says: {</p>
<p>[Some wrote "Advocating Culture," and I said: "Advocating" is the word for "Prostitute." Wherever culture is developed, there must be many prostitutes, saying that culture is clarified by prostitutes, which is also logically sound.] We do not write "Prostitute's" "chang" as "advocating" now, but the two words were commonly used before. Mr. Liu is probably quoting from ancient books. But if you want to quote ancient books, I remember there is a sentence in [The Book of Songs] that says "Chang yu he nu," which does not seem to be interpreted as "I also became a prostitute to echo others." So that misspelling is just a mistake, ridiculous and contemptible, but it does not belong to him. There is also one named {</p>
<p>[Fortunately, [the buds of scientific thought] are sprouting,]</p>
<p>The word [sprouting] and the word [buds] both have a circle next to them, probably indicating that the laughable part is here, but I think [sprouts], [shoots], are certainly a noun, [budding], [germinating], become a verb,</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, people advocated [Mr. Liu might interpret it as [raising prostitutes], people who write vernacular do not think it is strange to write a few wrong characters or use a few wrong classics, but because some opponents say that those who advocate vernacular are all people who do not know ancient books and speak nonsense, they often write a few sentences of classical Chinese to shut their mouths. But of course, because they come from the old camp, their accumulated habits are too deep, and they cannot get rid of them for a while, so it cannot be said that there are no authors with the breath of classical Chinese.</p>
<p>The vernacular movement of that time was victorious, and some warriors even climbed up because of this, but because they climbed up, they not only no longer fought for the vernacular, but also trampled it under their feet, took out ancient characters to laugh at the young people who came later. Because they are still using ancient books and ancient characters to laugh at people, some young people regard reading ancient books as an indispensable effort, and regard authors who often use classical Chinese as models to imitate, no longer trying to develop on new roads and create new situations.</p>
<p>There are two people here now: one is a student, who wrote [留學生] (liuxuesheng, international student) as [流學生] (liuxuesheng, wandering student) in the article, one wrong character; one is a university professor, who triumphantly wrote a poem, saying, [The teacher has committed a heinous crime, and is punished to go to the Western Paradise to make the learning flow. He should be the tenth class, boiling a pot of oil from exhausted gluten.] Let's see, which side is laughable?</p>
<h3>Autumn Shade Notes 2 Shaoxing Wine Prices</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>In Chinese notes, the price of wine in the Tang Dynasty is feared, and every time poems such as "three hundred bronze coins" or "fine wine ten thousand per dou" are used as answers, it is really unreliable, just like answering the source of the Yellow River with the three words "from the sky," which is the same. Now the most popular wine in China, which is excellent in color, aroma, and taste, is always Shaoxing wine, and the price of this Shaoxing wine is really strange, every household and every place is different. I don't know what it is like in Shaoxing City, but in places such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, the price of wine varies due to the different places, which can still be said. Even in the same place, under the same wine name, the price sometimes goes up and down, which is really strange. Of course, the quality and quantity of the wine are another matter. According to my experience, Shaoxing wine in Hangzhou is indeed cheaper than elsewhere, this is in terms of quality and quantity. As for some hotels that hang up a sign of decades of Chen, which is a few yuan a catty at every turn, that is a deceptive talk. A few days ago, because of the rain, I had a big drunk at Yue's Tomb, and sang out, "Ten days of autumn shade, the water hits the sky, the lake and mountains are good but not allowed to fall, but with the extremely cheap Hangzhou wine, I am drunk in front of Xiling Yue's Tomb," which is also a real writing. Shaoxing wine from Dongpu and Ruan She is the best, other places. Although there are also workshops, the taste is always a little worse, probably because of the water.</p>
<h3>Ganpu Correspondence (5)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Brother ○○··</p>
<p>These two days, we have been living in the salt fields' rise and decline, we have learned a lot about salt making. We who have always lived in the metropolis, once we enter this salt area, it is as if we have run into another world, everything is unfamiliar, everything is new. ］　［In the new　］, we gradually understand the difficulty of salt production, and in the land of salt, there have been many things that are worth our attention, such as the struggle between people and nature, and the hand-to-hand combat between people and wealthy gentry, like the endless sea waves, these things are constantly happening, in the past and in the present.</p>
<p>In order, let's talk about the production process of salt first. Salt, like rice, has fields, generally called [salt fields]; the so-called [salt production] is actually the beach where sea sprouts grow. Dividing these pure sandy beaches according to their width, they become one mu of field. The reason why they are divided horizontally instead of vertically is because the straightness grows towards the sea from time to time and cannot have any pattern. For each family or each mu of salt field, the salt farmers often plant a row of green grass at the boundary, which is probably the boundary marker. Such salt fields, when you drive past Zhapu, stretch along the coast: when you see a vast sea embankment, and there are protruding mounds of earth on the embankment, which look like graves from a distance, remember, this is the hometown of the salt you eat every day. When the tide comes, this kind of field is completely submerged in the water, and this is when the majestic sea plants salt in the salt farmers' fields. When the tide recedes, what is left for the salt farmers is a wet field, which the salt farmers are happy about. But salt does not succeed like this, after the tide comes, the salt farmers have to pin their hopes on the sky, they are eager for the arrival of strong sunlight. After a day of continuous sunshine, it always takes four or five days of continuous sunshine for the salt field to be completely sun-dried to white, and this white is the so-called salt. However, it must be continued for four or five days of sunshine, if it is sun-dried to the third or fourth day, and a burst of rain comes from the sky, and the rain reaches the size of dripping water on the eaves, then this time of sunshine is wasted, and the salt farmers, in addition to frustration, can only continue to wait for a few days, because the salt sun-dried to the soil surface is washed back into the soil by the rain. Even if it is sun-dried for four or five days, everyone has already shaved the ash and turned the soil, if it rains again, the work of turning the soil and shaving the ash is still without value. Therefore, after six or seven suns in a row, salt can be received: however, the procedure is not finished like this.</p>
<p>Regarding [shaving ash], we have to say a little more in detail. In the meantime, there are still many processes. When the sun has completely dried the salt to the soil surface, the salt farmers agree to shave it. Like the people working in the rice fields, they bring a lot of ash-shaving tools, and things like smoke and tea, and start working in the salt fields. Their first procedure is [shaving ash], the so-called [shaving ash] means scraping up the top layer of soil with a [shaving knife]. The [shaving knife] is a rectangular wooden frame about four or five feet long, with wood on three sides, and a cutting knife about one and a half feet long at the bottom. The salt farmer puts this on his head, holds both sides with both hands, the cutting knife penetrates into the soil, step by step, line by line, and drags it backward with great effort, so that the floating surface of the soil turns over under the edge of the knife, this is the soil with the most salt juice. After turning it over, let the sun dry it for another day and a half, and proceed to the next step of [pouring ash] work. [Pouring ash], the meaning of this is very easy to understand, that is, using a basket to pour this shaved soil into the salt pool. Speaking of [pouring ash], I have to conveniently, or even emphasize, to talk about the women in the salt field. In the salt field, in general, there are more female workers, they work very hard, and their results are often better than those of men, they do all aspects of the work in the process of salt making, [pouring ash] is also mostly done by them. They are as skilled in this aspect of work as men, and can quickly pour the ash into the basket, and when they pick it to the edge of the salt pool, they do not need to pour it one basket at a time, or have to put down the burden to pour it. They still stand straight, carry the ash on their shoulders, just pull the ropes at both ends and tilt, and all the ash in the two baskets falls into the pool. This way of pouring is what we usually see, but it is by no means an easy thing, so I specifically mention it here. This ash of the floating layer of soil is poured into the salt pool, but the procedure is not finished yet, followed by [picking water] [making brine] and other steps. For the sake of the　width,</p>
<p>In this letter, I cannot continue, I can only leave it for tomorrow. However, just based on the process that has been involved, it can be seen that the making of salt is not simple and difficult, and what is described here is only the matter of salt itself, only one-half of the production process. The ancient poem chanted rice, saying that rice is [every grain is hard work], if you understand the manufacturing process of salt, then how can salt not be obtained from blood and sweat?</p>
<h3>Autumn Day (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>A pale yellow face appeared, he remembered that healthy color, which had disappeared long ago; wrinkles were increasing in ones and twos. He held his chin with his hands, those hands, with blue veins that were even more prominent, it was not necessary to be surprised, but the sigh in his heart was born naturally.</p>
<p>Is it the fear of death, that is definitely not entirely true; he has long held hatred, and feels that there is nothing to miss in the current world. And the fear of middle age, the fear of old age, can be said to be people who are not afraid of winter, but they hate the mood of autumn.</p>
<p>He sat down on the chair, lit a cigarette and smoked, felt the prickly beard and felt that he should stand up and fix his face, but he collapsed again.</p>
<p>Sitting down on the ground, he thought to himself: [Isn't youth already gone]?</p>
<p>The servant who lightly opened the door showed a bit of panic standing there.</p>
<p>"You got up so early?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer just because he was too lazy to open his mouth. This old servant, watching him grow up since he was a child, seemed to be able to see his heart so clearly, so he didn't come to ask again.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you wash your face?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to change clothes?"</p>
<p>He shook his head more vigorously, he seemed to hope that he could sit here alone, without a sound, so that the young memory could slowly crawl over. The old servant understood everything, so he lifted his steps lightly and retreated again.</p>
<p>He casually put his hand into the pocket of his pajamas, and his fingertip touched the slip of paper, and he remembered it immediately.</p>
<p>"People are really useless, how can I not remember anything?" He muttered.</p>
<p>Is it really that he doesn't remember? I'm afraid there hasn't been a moment in these fifteen years that he hasn't thought about her. And her shadow, as long as he closes his eyes, can flash out clearly, there is a small red mole there, there is a deep smile there, ···</p>
<p>Although he already knew what things were told to him inside, he still opened it and looked at it again, looking at her handwriting, which was said to be similar by a friend fifteen years ago, this has not changed. He can imagine what her posture should be when she writes, should there be a little twitch at the corner of her mouth? And he also remembers that the first time she picked up a pen in front of him, she covered it with one hand, with a naive shyness. And on that piece of paper it was written: On XX day, wait for me].</p>
<p>Is it attacked by a kind of joy, his hand is shaking slightly, and his eyes are a little blurry again, he wipes it with his hand, and tears are smeared evenly on his face.</p>

<p>Special Supplement</p>
<h3>Food Problems and Taxation</h3>
<p>— Jun Da</p>
<p>It is a clear phenomenon that Chinese agriculture has declined in recent years, and rice production has also declined at the same time. However, the decline in rice production and the panic about food are generally regarded as the same thing, that is, the food panic is caused by the lack of rice production, which is really a vulgar argument. First, the phenomenon of food shortage in China is manifested in the import of foreign rice, but the import of foreign rice has only been a matter of the last thirty or forty years. In the past, except for special years such as famine years, China did not feel the lack of rice, nor did it need foreign rice to help. Therefore, the [natural productivity] of Chinese rice has not fallen behind the demand for rice, which is certain. Second, even if it is said that the [natural productivity] of Chinese rice is quite large, but the actual production has decreased in recent years, such as the conversion of rice fields to opium and raw material crops such as cotton, as well as the impact of man-made and natural disasters on harvests, that is also a fact. However, at the same time, along with the decrease in rice production, the proportion of rice in the diet of the Chinese people is further decreasing. Not only will the farmers in several northern provinces who eat rice disappear, but also the farmers in the central and southern regions who mainly use rice as their staple food, their staple food is gradually being replaced by inferior agricultural products such as sweet potatoes. Therefore, the food panic in China today caused by the lack of rice supply and the decline in food production are two completely different things. Otherwise, why is it that the good harvests of rice last year and today not only cannot solve the food panic problem, but also aggravate the degree of food panic, promoting the general farmers to go hungry, either as bandits or as starving people, to rob rice?</p>
<p>Therefore, promoting the decline of rice production is one thing, and forming a food panic is another. Sometimes, it is not the decline of rice production that causes the food panic, but the food panic that promotes the decline of rice production, such as the phenomenon of [good harvest turning into disaster], which is one aspect of this fact. This is a characteristic of the current social relations in China.</p>
<p>The reasons for promoting the food panic are very complicated, and one of the most important aspects is the [exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies] that have been the target of the national revolution in the past and now, and that have been shouted to be limited but have never been abolished. It can be simply explained by the following points:</p>
<p>First, the largest consumer market for rice in China today is obviously not the rural areas but the cities. The poverty of the peasant economy makes rice farmers have no rice to eat, and wheat farmers have no flour to eat. Rice production is not spread all over the country, but only limited to a few provinces. Therefore, the regulation of production and sales has become an important part of the food problem. The existence of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies hinders this important work. Not to mention the ban on rice exports from various provinces, but the heavy taxes are enough to prevent the circulation of rice, so that rice in the rural areas of the production area cannot be sold to the cities of the consumption area. To illustrate it with an example, the tax per dan of rice in Hunan is one yuan for passport fee, one yuan and two jiao for water freight, four jiao for sack, three jiao and two fen for export tariff, two jiao for rising and combining, two jiao for Hunan commission, two jiao for water insurance barge fee and customs declaration fee, two jiao for Shanghai fire insurance commission, totaling three yuan, three jiao and two fen. In Jiangxi, the passport fee is one yuan, the water freight is four qian per hundred jin, about eight jiao and five fen per bag, four jiao for sack, three jiao and three fen for export tariff, three jiao for rising and combining, two jiao for Jiangxi commission, two jiao for water insurance barge fee and customs declaration fee, two jiao for Shanghai commission fire insurance miscellaneous fees, totaling three yuan, one jiao and seven fen. In Wuhu, Anhui, the passport fee is four jiao, the water freight is three qian per hundred jin, about six jiao and five fen per bag, four jiao for sack, three jiao for export tax, five jiao for rising and combining, five liang per thousand taels for exchange water, three jiao for miscellaneous expenses, two jiao per shi for water insurance barge fee and customs declaration fee, totaling about three yuan (see page 33 of the first issue of China Economic). In other places, such as Sichuan, the land of abundance, the heavy taxes often cause the crops to rot in the fields. Therefore, as found in the Jiangsu investigation, the price of rice in the place of origin and in the city often differs by six or seven times (see the last chapter of Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Records). In this way, not only is it unprofitable for farmers to sell rice, but even at a loss, even rice dealers and rice merchants often stop. As reported by the Dagongbao on July 26 this year: [The food in Shanxi Province has always been surplus and sold to Hebei. Since the great harvest last year, not only has each county accumulated excess, forming a tragic phenomenon of low grain prices hurting farmers. Even in Taiyuan, this spring, grain merchants have suffered huge losses due to the slump in rice prices and sluggish sales. In addition, financial barriers and no way to sell goods have led to the successive closure of more than a dozen companies. However, in Hebei, from Shijiazhuang in the south to Shunde and Handan, and to Baoding in the north, according to a recent survey, the price of rice is almost equal to that of wheat. The lack of rice, beans and miscellaneous grains can be imagined. Shanxi and Hebei are close to each other, separated by a mountain, one side with overproduction; stockpiling and stagnation, and the other side with insufficient supply and high grain prices]. The reason for such stagnation is that, in addition to the high transport costs of the state-owned railways, which are disguised taxes, the direct blow is still the heavy taxes.</p>
<p>Second, another aspect of the food panic is the excessively low price of rice in the rice-producing areas, the so-called low grain prices hurting farmers: the reason is the same as the excessively high price of rice in the consumer market due to heavy taxes, which is still due to the excessive taxes. The heavy taxes make the price of rice too high on the one hand, and the price of rice falls on the other hand. This is not contradictory, but inevitable. Because farmers bear a heavy burden, they have to borrow money, or pre-sell grain, or sell the harvested rice urgently in order to pay taxes urgently. This will inevitably cause the price of rice to fall to the lowest limit, which is another aspect of the food panic.</p>
<p>The heavy taxes borne by farmers in various places are sometimes unbelievable. For example, in the He Tao regions, where [the Yellow River has a hundred diseases, only enriches one set], the heavy taxes borne by farmers have reached the point where the harvest from year-round hard work is not enough to pay taxes. Farmers have to flee, and the amount of wasteland is increasing day by day (22, 6, 15, Dagongbao). In the Zhenjiang and Huai'an areas of Jiangsu Province, the total amount of surtaxes exceeds ten times the regular tax. Every time something is started, there is one more surcharge. The affairs are replaced, but the surcharge always exists (22, 5, 28, Dagongbao). The burden on the farmers in Ningyuan makes even middle-class farmers unable to maintain it (22, 8, 2, ibid.). Jin County used to be a wealthy area, but in recent years, there have been many institutions and the burden has become heavier day by day. The peasant economy has been in a panic. The annual income, after all taxes and duties, is very little, and the people are in extreme distress (22, 7, 20, ibid.). The exorbitant taxes in Shaoyang are even more shocking. One tael of land tax requires the payment of more than fourteen yuan (22, 9, 6, ibid.). The heavy land taxes in Baoding caused poverty among farmers, to the extent that merchants dared not bid for contracts (22, 7, 11). In the northern counties of Jiangsu Province, [merchants are at a loss, and all businesses are becoming more and more declining. The counties of Huai, Lian, Si, Shu, Su and Sui add funding to the county-level institutions, all of which are taken from the farmers, who are exhausted to cope] (22, 10, 4, Da Wanbao). When tax collectors are hired, they have no choice but to sell the only food left to maintain their families at a low price. For example, last year [farmers in Shaanxi received one stone of grain, the market price was only three or four yuan, but from this one stone of grain, they had to pay taxes of eight or nine yuan. The tax exceeded the production price by one time. In order to pay the tax, farmers had to reduce their rice consumption and only eat porridge. The saved wheat and rice were moved to the cities for sale, so there was a lot of food on the market, with no way to go, and the price became even cheaper (21, 10, 16, Xi'an Daily). Some, in order to pay taxes, often pre-sell their rice before it is harvested (see Chapter 1, Chapter 3 of China's Rural Economic Data, Liming Bookstore). Even when the harvest comes, it is not enough to pay for the goods that have been pre-sold. Furthermore, in Sichuan Province, taxes are not fixed. As long as there is a war, there is an extortion. Today, the land tax has been pre-collected until 1996 (22, 7, 3, Shishi Xinbao). When faced with this kind of sudden extortion, farmers naturally have to sell their grain at [any price] to exchange for cash.</p>
<p>Third, another aspect of the food panic is that even if rice production is declining, one of the major reasons is closely related to taxation. The production cost of rice is much higher than that of soybeans and sweet potatoes. Taxation makes farmers generally poor, and as a result, they are unable to engage in rice production. According to the report of the Shanghai City Four Rural Areas Farm Cost Survey, the benefits of growing rice are much higher than those of growing soybeans. Most of the rice growers are owner-farmers, and most of the tenant farmers grow soybeans, and very few grow rice (Chapter 2 of China's Rural Economic Data). In various counties of Zhejiang Province, the planting area of sweet potatoes has reached the third place, and it is gradually expanding. There is no other reason for this, except that the cost of sweet potato planting is extremely low, from which we can know the relationship between the economic situation of farmers and the planting of agricultural products. Taxes make it impossible for farmers to maintain their livelihoods by growing rice and other food crops, and they have to switch to planting plants with higher profits, and opium is one of the main ones. For example, the "lazy tax" in Sichuan is simply forcing farmers to grow opium.</p>
<p>Fourth, the poverty of the farm economy caused by heavy taxation on the one hand leads to a reduction in rice production, and on the other hand leads to a reduction in consumption. It has become a common phenomenon for farmers not to eat rice. Not to mention the northern provinces, even in the central and southern provinces that mainly use rice as their staple food, the tendency of farmers' food to go from good to bad is also very obvious. For example, in Yuezhou, Hubei Province, grain is the main agricultural product, but very few farmers eat rice. The main food is sweet potatoes, beans, and sometimes a small amount of rice is mixed in for food (Hubei Goods and Medicine Magazine No. 104). Furthermore, as Marshall said; in most parts of Guangdong, sweet potatoes have accounted for the second place in farmers' food. In Zhejiang, most farmers have replaced rice with sweet potatoes (see Chinese Rural Economic Research). Since, due to the heavy taxes, it is not easy to transport rice from the place of origin to the consumer market, and at the same time, due to the poverty of the farm families, very few farmers in the rice-producing area eat rice, the rice will inevitably be stockpiled in the place of origin, forming another aspect of the food panic, [the surplus of food].</p>
<p>Therefore, whether directly or indirectly, the existence of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies is an obstacle to solving the food problem in China, which is beyond doubt. Without solving the tax problem, it is futile to tax foreign rice. However, today in China, whether it is the central government or the local government, even with the existing income from these taxes, they still feel financial difficulties. Therefore, how easy is it to abolish all the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies that hinder the solution of the food problem?</p>
<h3>Review of the Grain Storage System</h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities telegraphed the governments of eight provinces, including Jiangxi and Hunan, to send representatives to discuss the food problem. The telegraph listed three fundamental policies for rescuing the rural areas. The second and third items are about the grain storage problem: "... (2) Handle grain storage and restore the old system of local granaries. Last year, the Wuchang Headquarters repeatedly ordered and sent letters to various provinces to urge the handling of this matter. You should check and handle it carefully and effectively. (3) It is proposed that the central government should use the cotton and wheat loan to create new warehouses in various provinces to handle active storage, loan borrowing, and transportation and sales in order to regulate the people's food, increase grain prices, circulate rural finance, and turn over funds in the future..." These two policies have the same effect, but different in nature. In my ignorance, I will briefly discuss what I know as follows:</p>
<p>First, all social phenomena have their own closely related aspects and a certain foundation, which varies with the times. The methods that are applicable in one era may not be applicable in another. It is impossible for the new dynasty to strive to restore the so-called "well-field" system before the Spring and Autumn Period. Regardless of how hard the restoration movement of the past dynasties tried, it was in vain. Today, the situation is the same when trying to restore the old-fashioned grain storage.</p>
<p>In the past, grain storage, such as social granaries and charitable granaries, was mainly based on farmers' voluntary storage of food. Its only foundation was built on the "local self-sufficient economy." At that time, the power of commodity exchange was not great. Not only was the agricultural production of a county relatively self-sufficient, but also most farmers could be self-sufficient. They used their own agricultural products for their own consumption. If there was a surplus, they could naturally store it to prevent famine. Whether it is a village, a clan, or a township, as long as it is in the same economic entity, a grain storage can be established.</p>
<p>But the current situation is completely different. Since the invasion of capitalism, the torrent of commodities has long broken the local self-sufficient economy based on families, villages, and even counties and provinces. As the local economy is destroyed, the grain storage system built on the local economy will naturally collapse.</p>
<p>According to all the current rural survey reports, it can be clearly seen that the farm economy in various parts of China has been completely commodified. Not only do they have to buy clothing and other supplies from the market, but also most of their food is bought from the market. On the other hand, for all kinds of needs, they mostly sell the harvested food after the autumn harvest, and rarely store it for their own use. They often sell their own food at a low price today, and buy back their own food at a high price tomorrow. This is not contradictory, because after the invasion of capitalism, nine out of ten farmers are in debt. In order to cope with high-interest loans, land rent, and taxes, they have no choice but to sell agricultural products at low prices in a hurry, but in hunger and cold, they have no choice but to endure the exploitation of commercial usurers, and endure the pain to borrow or buy some food to maintain their lives. In the past, farmers were self-sufficient in agricultural products and had a surplus, and they could establish grain storage to prevent famine. Now, farmers are groaning in the whirlpool of commodities, and they are helpless in hunger and cold. Under such a transformation, the grain storage system will inevitably be completely destroyed.</p>
<p>In addition to the farmers' voluntary storage, there were also local public granaries, mainly those of a clan or surname. But now, the "public fields" nominally public property in various places are monopolized by a few private individuals, and in recent years, the process of public fields joining the buying and selling has intensified, and most of them have successively fallen into the hands of private individuals. After the elimination of public property and public fields, the so-called public granaries based on public groups will naturally no longer be able to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first type of old-fashioned grain storage is not only inevitably destroyed today, but also very difficult to restore.</p>
<p>Second, as far as the second type of new-style grain storage is concerned, as described in the telegram, its nature can be divided into two points. The first is to use the financial expenditure of the political storage to reward food and establish grain storage. The second point is to use this type of grain storage to operate food loans and regulate finance.</p>
<p>At first glance, no matter how the fundamental role of this type of new-style grain storage is, in terms of the nature of the first point, the government's finances have been exhausted in recent years, and it seems impossible to allocate some money from that part. If it is said that additional taxes are levied due to the handling of grain storage, it is harmful to the farmers before the benefits are seen, which is not what we hope. However, now it is said that a part is allocated from the cotton and wheat loan, and the situation seems to be different. The total amount of the cotton and wheat loan cannot be said to be small, but compared with the needs of various aspects of China today, it is really a drop in the bucket. Whether this matter can be realized, and whether the allocated part can be enough to carry out this small but huge work, can only be proved by future facts.</p>
<p>In terms of the second point, it is very common. The Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Shanghai Xinhua Bank have carried out this kind of work in counties such as Wuxi and Wujin. But what is its effect?</p>
<p>"In the winter of 1920, the Farmers Bank operated rice loan borrowing in Lisha (Wuxi). The loan was 7 yuan per shi of white rice, with a monthly interest of 1%, an insurance fee of 1%, and a storage fee of 2%, a handling fee of 3%, totaling 1.6%. By the end of June of the following year, those who were unable to redeem it would sell the pledged rice to offset the principal and interest, and the surplus would be returned. Farmers and small landlords were forced to borrow money, and those who carried rice came in droves. The amount of loans reached more than 18,000 yuan. Last year, due to the flood and famine, the entire town's rice fields were submerged, and eight or nine out of ten people had no grain to harvest. However, the rice loan operated by the Farmers Bank and the Xinhua Bank was nearly 20,000 yuan; the rice collected by the landlords and the entire harvest of the farmers in Zoujin were almost entirely pledged." (Yu Linjun's survey, China's Rural Economic Data, page 413.)</p>
<p>This means that, in the case of the collapse of the entire rural economy that cannot be solved, this kind of institution is only like the pawnshops in various counties in Shaanxi and Jieyang, Guangdong today. There is a danger that there is a full loan but no one to redeem it, and they are forced to open the door. Therefore, the piecemeal construction of the grain storage problem cannot yet be called a fundamental relief policy.</p>
<h3>The Central Question of the Tax on Foreign Rice: Is Taxing Beneficial to the Rural Areas?</h3>
<p>— Liang Ming</p>
<p>According to the report on October 8; The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee reviewed the import tax on foreign rice. Based on the national finance and the national economy, it decided to levy a tax. The highest tax rate is 2.50, and the lowest tax rate is tax-free. As for the detailed tax rate, the Ministry of Finance will formulate it by itself according to this established principle. Judging from this, the issue of taxing foreign rice, which has been delayed since the folk food conference last year and has been rumored frequently, is becoming more and more concrete, and the imposition of the tax seems to be not far away. Moreover, Guangdong, where the largest amount of foreign rice is imported, has already implemented it. Although rice merchants have repeatedly opposed it, the Guangdong government has firmly stated that it cannot withdraw its decision. There have also been many discussions on the issue of taxing foreign rice in recent months. The reason for taxing is nothing more than that the price of local rice has fallen, and taxing is to help farmers, which can also be said to be the first practical achievement shouted out in the past six months of "reviving the rural areas." However, in general discussions, the central question of whether taxing is beneficial to the rural areas is rarely fully explained.</p>
<p>First, we must first clarify the current situation of rice supply and demand: Anyone who knows a little about the general situation of China's rural economy knows that most of the farmers, who account for more than 80% of China's total population today, eat the lowest quality food such as corn, millet, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, and even wild vegetables. Used to fill the stomach. Except for landlords, rice-eating [rice] porridge and wheat rice is only a very small number of farmers. Therefore, the largest consumption of rice is in several large cities and a part of the towns. The composition of the population in cities is mainly industrial laborers and small white-collar workers. Rice does account for the most important part of their living expenses, so the price of rice is closely related to the livelihoods of these people. In previous labor strikes in Shanghai, a part of them were caused by the high price of rice, and laborers demanded an increase in "rice subsidies." Therefore, since the rice consumption market is mainly in large cities, and the rice-producing areas in China are not [limited] to each province, the transportation and regulation of rice has become the most important work. Of course, the competitive dumping of foreign rice is one of the reasons why local rice cannot stand. However, it cannot be denied that the collection of taxes in various provinces, the high transportation costs, and the obstacles such as the ban on exports often cause rice to be stockpiled in the place of origin, forming a surplus. Even within a province, sometimes between counties, they do not communicate with each other across borders. Other situations can be imagined.</p>
<p>Not only that, China currently implements a universal small-farmer system. The amount of rice produced by each farmer is limited and cannot directly reach the hands of consumers. It must be sold through intermediate merchants such as rice dealers and grain stores. The sale of rice by general farmers usually does not go beyond the following three forms: (1) Preselling at the time of showing harvest or even before sowing, (2) mortgaging due to borrowing money and saving food at the time of not harvesting and even not sowing, (3) immediately selling the harvested rice because they are anxious to pay rent and taxes as soon as the harvest is completed. When sold to rice dealers, grain stores or mortgaged to pawnshops through these three forms, farmers have absolutely no possibility of naturally choosing their selling price, and they can only let the other party decide. However, other methods are extremely rare in addition to these three forms of sale. We often read "Selling new silk in February, and new grain in May, treating the sore in front of us, but cutting out the flesh in our hearts." Unexpectedly, it is also a portrayal of modern rural areas.</p>
<p>Second, the result of taxing foreign rice is that imported foreign rice is consumed in cities. If the import tax on foreign rice is implemented, the price of rice will inevitably rise. After the news of the tax on foreign rice by the Guangdong Provincial Government spread, although it has not yet been implemented, the price of rice has risen, which can be used as proof. If the price of rice rises; if there are no supplementary measures, the price of rice will inevitably rise again. At this point, the industrial laborers who eat rice in the city and a part of the small white-collar workers will inevitably be greatly hit. Today, when the industrial recession is at its most severe, factories naturally have no power to increase the wages of workers and employees; what they can barely maintain is that the price of rice is cheap, and everything is also cheap. If the price of rice is high, not only will it not be able to stop the import of foreign rice, but the employees who rely on salary income will panic.</p>
<p>On the farmers' side, although not many farmers eat rice, the impact of the price increase on consumption is not as great as in the city, but it is not to say that no one eats rice. After the invasion of capitalism, the degree of commodification of agricultural products in China is very high. Many rice farmers do not eat the rice they produce themselves, but often sell the rice they produce themselves and buy rice on the market. This is a very common phenomenon in today's Chinese rural areas, which can be proved in various rural surveys. In this way, after the price of rice becomes expensive, the farmers who eat rice will also suffer a major blow. If it is said that the farmers who eat rice are mostly rich farmers and owner-farmers, the increase in the price of rice will promote the decline of rich farmers and owner-farmers, making the rural economy more and more likely to collapse.</p>
<p>The most important point of taxing foreign rice is to increase the price of local rice and increase the income of farmers. It is not to mention that not all farmers have recently planted rice. Even the farmers who plant rice will benefit less. After taxing foreign rice, the price of local rice may be increased, but this increase is mainly an increase in the price that rice merchants sell to consumers, not an increase in the price that producers sell to rice merchants. Because as long as the tenancy system, commercial usury, capital and exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies exist, farmers cannot but be poor. Because farmers are poor, they have to sell rice in one of the above three forms. In these three forms of sale, it is more of an exploitation than a sale. The benefit of the increased price of rice still does not go to the farmers. This is very important.</p>
<p>Therefore, in summary, taxing foreign rice, under the current situation, does not seem to have much effect on rescuing the rural areas. Moreover, if the Guangdong Provincial Government taxes foreign rice, it is said to be used to rescue the rural areas. However, according to the Guangzhou Correspondence in the Da Wanbao in September of this year, because the annual import of foreign rice in Guangdong Province is worth 60 to 70 million Hong Kong dollars, if 10% is taken from the value, the income can also reach between 8 and 9 million national currency. The current financial difficulty in Guangdong is only this, and a single move can solve the financial difficulty, so it should be done decisively. The intention of taxing can be seen.</p>
<p>General formalists believe that "yes" and "no" can be determined between the two extremes of facts. In reality, it is not that simple. If the dumping of foreign rice is not suppressed, Chinese local rice will never have a time to develop, and China's rural economy will only tend to collapse day by day. However, if the internal causes of rice production decline and food panic are not eradicated, and there is no unified method for production and sales, the role of taxing foreign rice is only to increase the burden of the people!</p>

<h3>Financial: Foreign Exchange Loan Market Shrinks, Settlement Suspended</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. The market was unusually bleak. Although native banks (錢莊) were open for business as usual, without the large-scale inflows and outflows of foreign banks, they were also much quieter. The market price of foreign exchange loans (洋拆) was consistently six fen in both the morning and afternoon sessions, a sharp drop of four fen compared to the previous day. The situation was quite loose and excessive. The volume of transactions in the loan market was over 4.3 million in the morning session, over 800,000 in new transactions, and over 200,000 in the afternoon session. Transactions at the Small Exchange Association totaled over 500,000. Native banks settled over 3.1 million in foreign promissory notes. There were no settlement records for foreign exchange forward contracts due to the bank holiday. As for the prices of subsidiary currencies, most were stable. The early morning price of Jiangsu small silver dollars (江南小洋) was 839 yuan, down five jiao (角) from the previous session. The price of Guangdong small silver dollars (廣東小洋) was 786 yuan, also down one yuan and five jiao from the previous afternoon session. In the afternoon session, Jiangsu small silver dollars fell another yuan to 838 yuan, while Guangdong small silver dollars rose one jiao to 786 yuan and one jiao. The trading volume for Jiangsu jiao was 8,000 jiao in the morning session and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon session. For Guangdong, the volume was 65,000 jiao in the morning session and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins were released at a volume of 2,000 wen (文), totaling 303,000 wen, with transactions totaling 35,754 strings (串), equivalent to 11,800 yuan in silver.</p>

<h3>Message Regarding the End of Semi-Annual Long-Term Loans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 15th day of the 10th lunar month, was also the only period for the settlement of long-term loans. All long-term loan items made in the previous period (15th day of the 4th lunar month) with a six-month term were due yesterday and needed to be repaid or rolled over. It is understood that all merchant guilds (帮) have such long-term loans, with the Ningbo (甬) native banks issuing a significant amount. However, yesterday was a Sunday, a bank holiday. Therefore, Chinese banks that observe Sunday holidays could not process these transactions. Those that were open for half a day in the morning generally processed them. As a result, the total amount of these inflows and outflows for the day reached over 15 million. The situation can be categorized as follows: (1) Rollover of old account funds: over 3 million; (2) Matured loans extended because repayment was not possible: over 1.4 million; (3) Funds transferred to other banks: about 2 million; (4) Rollover of Ningbo native bank loans: over 4 million; (5) Newly issued loans: over 1 million; (6) Newly received term deposits: 2.8-2.9 million. In addition, there were new remittances from Ningbo native banks seeking lending opportunities in Shanghai, totaling over 1 million. A considerable amount of bank-related matters could not be processed due to time constraints and will need to be sorted out today. The interest rates set on that day varied widely, ranging from 7.5 to 11 taels, so a detailed breakdown cannot be provided.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Show Temporary Signs of Rising; Long and Short Positions Still Significant, Indicating Further Competition</h3>
<p>During the past week, from October 9th to 14th, the market environment at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was stable. Although the issuance of new treasury bonds was substantial, they were not circulating in the market, and the financial sector saw a surplus of cash, which could be used as part of the reserve. With many short positions on the market, a short squeeze occurred on Monday, and market prices rose steadily. In particular, the supply of "Golden Long" bonds dried up, rising by 1.3 yuan. Other bonds also increased by 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan. Tuesday was the Double Tenth Festival, and the market was closed. When it reopened on Wednesday, the bulls showed some exhaustion and slight weakness. However, salt tax and "Golden Long" bonds continued to rise due to short covering, and subsequently continued to rise by 6-7 jiao. Most treasury bonds reached new highs. On Thursday, the 4th and 11th series were heavily traded, while the 50th series had weak absorption and fell by 6-7 jiao. On Friday, there was a lot of position switching between long and short parties, and market prices fluctuated. As a result, gains and losses were mixed. On Saturday, trading was extremely quiet, and the market was sluggish. As a result, declines outnumbered gains, and the range of highs and lows was only 1-2 jiao. Overall, the market price rose across the board during the week, ranging from 4-5 jiao to 1.2-3 yuan. The trend is temporarily fluctuating, but with significant long and short positions, further competition is expected. The total transaction volume for the week was 48,346,000 yuan, including 16,000 yuan in cash, 18,425,000 yuan in salt tax futures, 6,830,000 yuan in Jiji-Bing futures, 5,195,000 yuan in 1929 Customs bonds, 7,855,000 yuan in 1930 and 1931 Customs bonds, 5,725,000 yuan in the 1937 6% bonds, and other various bonds ranging from tens of thousands to over one million. 50 shares of stock were traded at the exchange.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Fluctuating American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market initially weakened due to the poor performance of Wall Street and political news favoring short positions. Later, it strengthened due to some short covering.

<h3>American Cotton Affected by Increased Receipts</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York dated the 13th reported on the cotton market for the week, stating that the cotton market was mixed and unstable. Although the government planned to release cotton loans and pay rental fees, the harvest estimates increased again. Prior to the government report, hedging sales and long liquidation hindered the rebound. However, the regulation of pledging one cent per pound is expected to be announced soon. The payment of rental fees, approximately between US$3 and US$11 per acre, will be allocated to cotton growers participating in next year's acreage reduction program, which aims to reduce cotton acreage to 25 million acres. This announcement will encourage cotton farmers to hoard their cotton and wait for the price of one cent per pound. If so, the spot position will inevitably tighten, and hedging sales will become sluggish. The Cotton Exchange estimates that world cotton consumption for August this year was 2,179,000 bales, compared to 1,819,000 bales at the same time last year. Therefore, this year's consumption is expected to be a constructive record.</p>

<h3>Grains: Newly Harvested Superior Rice Sells Well</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources of supply. After the market seemed sluggish the afternoon before yesterday, it suddenly reversed course today. Shops on this street were particularly eager, so the situation gradually turned favorable. Later, the Northern and Southern trading houses also made some moves, further improving the outlook. The Southern trading house purchased about 1,000 bags of newly harvested Yang superior rice, and the price immediately rose by 2 jiao. Newly harvested japonica rice also saw price increases. However, although the Northern trading house acquired most of the newly harvested japonica rice from kiln warehouses, the demand was tight, so prices remained flat. Various grades of broken rice remained firm and sold at prices outside the range. Newly harvested Yin Yuan rice showed a slight increase, while Bian Yuan rice was not traded.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Local Refined White Sugar Drops Another Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended flat. The guild set the price of No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 21.6 yuan, down 2 fen from the previous day. The asking price for No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 20.85 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Dutch Red No. 8-9 was priced at 16.7-16.75 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's "B" mark was down 5 fen to 21.6 yuan.

Zhenji No. 1 was 20.4 yuan, with No. 2-5 grades following a declining scale. Chaozhou traders offered over 100 packages of Chaozhou green sugar at prices ranging from 15.25 to 15.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Red Rice Arrivals and Inventory Both Scarce</h3>
<p>Red rice arrivals have been limited recently. Market inventory is indeed low. However, sales from various quarters are weak, resulting in a flat trend. Currently, the price of Chaozhou noodles quoted by Zhongzhuang is 31.5-32 yuan, with scattered transactions. The market outlook suggests no immediate price movements. The quoted selling price is 33 yuan, with lower grades discounted accordingly.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>On Fence-Sitting</h3>
<p>—Wen Bing</p>
<p>Let me begin by citing a factual example, something similar to fence-sitting: the bat. There's a story about it: When the beasts of the land gathered, the bat went to participate. When asked about its qualifications, it said it could walk on the ground, like a rat. When the birds of the air gathered, the bat also went to participate. When asked about its qualifications, it said it could fly in the air, like a sparrow. In this way, the small bat can both walk and fly, just like an amphibious frog, at home in the water and equally at home on land. This expands its living space and naturally brings richer and more lasting enjoyment; its life seems more fulfilling and longer than usual.</p>
<p>Fence-sitting is just such a game. One foot on this side, the other on that, pleasing both. Here, I’m pointing out a human art of living, no, a unique life philosophy, because it’s similar to the bat, so it’s best to make a comparison.</p>
<p>Talking about fence-sitting is both verbose and hard to encompass; I have to make a summarized explanation. Where is its beauty? What’s it about? See below:</p>
<p>For example, your left and right neighbors are feuding enemies, locked in generations of resentment. It's hard to be in the middle. This is a good time to try fence-sitting. When your left neighbor tells you about your right neighbor's faults, you sympathize and nod. If he wants you to help set your right neighbor’s house on fire, aside from considering what will happen if the fire rises and you have to tear down your own eaves, you might as well lend a hand. Conversely, if your right neighbor tells you about your left neighbor's evil plot, you don't just sympathize and nod; it's best to stand up for justice and give a great speech about how base and poisonous your left neighbor is. If he plans to sue in court, your writing is sure to be sharp, so you might as well enthusiastically take on the task of drafting the complaint, just like Mao Sui recommending himself. But be careful; write it on the third shelf, sealing all the door and window gaps with paper, lest the news leak and your left neighbor loses face.</p>
<p>In this way, you will please both sides and gain mutual benefit: your east neighbor will invite you to drink and dine, and give you gifts for the New Year, and your right neighbor will make you the godfather of his son. To put it broadly, when you are in a difficult situation, borrowing grain or rice, or even borrowing thirty or fifty silver dollars, will be easy to obtain. In short, although your left and right neighbors are enemies, they treat you especially well; this is the best philosophy for everyday life.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the same technique in society. If you want to be active in politics and become an official, it's best to be good to Mr. X and also to Mr. Y, to the southwest and to the northwest. That way, the other side will naturally reciprocate, and it won't be difficult to have a smooth official career. Even if it is difficult to hold a high position in one place, you can always live privately, drawing a dry salary from one side and receiving a stipend from the other. When you go out, you can get travel expenses from here, and from there...</p>
<p>As for writers, they can also use fence-sitting. You have to be able to be new and old, radical and outdated. If a society is run by a certain faction, you propagate that faction's ideology; if another society requires a different approach, you switch tactics. If you're writing for a supplement or magazine, you have to be able to handle both old-style and new-style essays. If you cater to their taste, then your</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>great work and name will shine in publications of the X faction, and you will also be able to establish a foothold in another XX faction.</p>
<p>That being said, sometimes things go wrong. After all, you are standing on two sides, and you put in a lot of effort. If your legs cramp, and your fence-sitting skills are maxed out, you might fall. But this is obviously an exception and a minority, so there's no need to worry so much.</p>
<p>In general, it requires a lot of top-notch self-cultivation; it's not something you can achieve in one jump. I’ve already said a lot. When I have time, I may write a sequel, "Fence-Sitting: Advanced Studies."</p>
<h3>Major Events of the Week</h3>

<h3>Diplomas and Career Paths</h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>A diploma is said to be a piece of paper that proves one's academic qualifications, eligibility, and level of education. Therefore, if you want to prove that you are a graduate of a certain university, specialized school, or middle school, you only need to drag out that precious "diploma" and show it off. It is also because of this reason that people spend a high price to "buy" or "forge" this precious item.</p>
<p>But in reality, how much of this is true? In fact, in today's society, those without diplomas are often well-fed, clothed, and carefree, but conversely, those with diplomas don't even have pants to wear.</p>
<p>According to a newspaper report a few days ago, a university graduate named Feng was arrested for forging a diploma to defraud money. Since Feng is a university graduate, he must have a diploma! But what use is the diploma to him?</p>
<p>On the streets of Shanghai, we can often see people spreading out their precious diplomas to beg for help. In short, this kind of "diploma incompetence" is not uncommon; Feng's case is just one example!</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, those people who enjoy all the happiness in life do not necessarily have diplomas! Some have never even seen that precious item in their entire lives!</p>
<p>Therefore, in today's distorted society, if you only have a diploma and want to find a career path, it is just a dream! But, if you don't have a diploma but have a special background and connections, then your career prospects are very promising. If you have both a special background, connections, and a diploma, that would be even better.</p>
<p>In summary, diplomas and career paths are not related. Without a certain intermediary, diplomas will never have any effect, and there will be no career path to speak of. That is to say, under special circumstances, there is a possibility of connection between diplomas and career paths. And, as long as this contradictory society exists, this phenomenon will continue.</p>

<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>A Shanghai person's breakfast. Except in the homes of the wealthy, where chefs cook elaborate snacks. Everyone else usually eats hastily. Congee, crab shell pastry, pan-fried buns, glutinous rice rolls, flatbread with fried dough sticks are the most common delicacies. The parasitic masters and mistresses in mansions listen to storytelling day and night and smoke opium. They don't go to bed until the sun is high. They only have white fungus, lotus seed soup, sweet osmanthus and white sugar porridge, lard and red bean paste eight treasure rice and other delicate things as late-night snacks. They fundamentally don't have breakfast. Many thrifty comrades drink a cup of plain water and a snack after washing in the morning. Anyway, lunch is not far away. They just tighten their belts.</p>
<p>As for dinner, the wealthy have banquets with each other. Dance halls, restaurants, clubs, and private restaurants come in all shapes and sizes and are too numerous to list. Ordinary people always eat a home-cooked meal at home.</p>
<p>Only lunch falls between morning and evening. It is most important for nutrition and the body. People who work during the day have the most variety of lunch styles. There are at least ten levels. However, their outcome is only to fill their stomachs. They all turn into rice excrement. They can also all extend life.</p>
<p>(1) Three-Day-Old Cold Rice - Saves a Penny</p>
<p>(2) Rickshaw Puller - Plain Noodles Plus Three - Fifteen Copper Coins</p>
<p>(3) Shop Clerk - Glutinous Rice Rolls, Fried Tofu, Vermicelli Soup - Twenty Copper Coins</p>
<p>(4) Junior Foreign Firm Employee - Buttered Bread or Beef Noodles - One Dime</p>
<p>(5) Mid-Level Foreign Firm Employee - Shen Wanxing or Wufangshou's Set Meal - Twenty-Two Cents</p>
<p>(6) Senior Employee - YMCA or Great China's Set Meal - Eighty Cents</p>
<p>(7) At Least a Foreigner - Deng Tuomo or Navy YMCA's Big Meal - One Dollar and Twenty Cents</p>
<p>(8) Small Manager - Shanghai and Citibank's Set Meal - Five Dollars</p>
<p>(9) Taipan - Licha and Huizhong Hotel's Set Meal - Ten Dollars</p>
<p>(10) The Wealthiest - Huate and other hotels' lavish meals - Fifteen to Fifty Dollars</p>
<p>Eaters ranging from "penniless" to dozens of gold can perhaps be jealous in sequence. But being able to "fill your stomach" is always the best. We think of those millions of compatriots who have been affected by disasters. Are their five senses, four limbs, and internal organs different from ours? They can't even find grass roots and tree bark. Being a "cold rice" comrade is not a blessing.</p>

This is the relationship between the common people and the officials. But all my family members were killed by artillery fire, and my thatched hut was burned so that I can't find the direction. Only I am left as a bare stick in the ranks of the militia. I have guns in my hands, and if they dare to ask me for money, I can give them a bullet.</p>
<p>Soldier A: That's right, great! But there are many who don't have guns? What about them? Are they just waiting to die?</p>
<p>Soldier B: It's the same, those who don't want to die come to the militia!</p>
<p>Soldier C: (Rushing in from the left) Hurry, hurry, the Japanese soldiers are coming to clear the countryside.</p>
<p>Soldier Xin: How many people are there?</p>
<p>Soldier C: I don't know, I heard it's only a hundred or so guns. The village chief here invited them. They're about to enter the village.</p>
<p>Soldier A: Why should we leave? Is it the captain's order?</p>
<p>Soldier C: Of course, he said we have fewer people, they have more people, and we don't need to lose strength.</p>
<p>Soldier Xin: That makes a lot of sense. Let's disperse for now and wait for them to leave before we talk.</p>
<p>Soldier A: No, what are you talking about? We're not playing hide-and-seek with the Japanese soldiers, why should we hide? Where do we go to attack them?</p>
<p>Soldier B: Good, let's go to the village entrance on this side to ambush them. (Seeing the platoon leader coming from the left.) Platoon leader, we still have a machine gun, why should we run away? There is a small road at the village entrance on this side, with mountains on both sides. They must pass that way when they go back.</p>
<p>Soldier Wu: That's right, I also know that road clearly. There's no need to use guns at all. Just throw some big rocks down on both sides of the mountain, and you can kill them all cleanly.</p>
<p>Soldier C: But the captain's order is for us to retreat.</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: That's okay, the captain won't forbid us from fighting the Japanese soldiers. But do you all know that road?</p>
<p>Soldier Wu: I know, I'll take responsibility.</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: Good, it's your small team that will go. Are there any others?</p>
<p>Soldier Ding: They're in that forest, we have to pass that way.</p>
<p>(They take their weapons and exit from the right side of the stage.)</p>
<p>(The stage is temporarily silent, for about a minute, faint footsteps are heard. After a while, a youth comes up from the left in great tension and hides behind a big tree. After a while, a voice comes from afar.)</p>
<p>Voice: Big Monk... Big Monk...</p>
<p>Youth: Damn it, what are you shouting for!</p>
<p>Voice: ...Big Monk (Another youth comes up from the left.)</p>
<p>Youth: You're here, what's going on?</p>
<p>Youth: How is my family now?</p>
<p>Youth B: Your sister called Seventh Grandfather, he's pleading with Third Master Zhou.</p>
<p>Youth: Damn him, one day, I will chop him into minced meat.</p>
<p>Youth B: Tell me, what exactly is going on?</p>
<p>Youth: Seven or eight days ago, Third Master Zhou ran to my house to collect debts. Do you think anyone has money to pay debts at this time? I said "No." "No?" he said, "Is no enough to settle things?" I said, "What do you plan to do?" Later he said, "Okay, you wait, and see if you don't pay me back." Because of this, he hated me so much that he ran to the county town to accuse me, saying that I was a traitor. He said I was colluding with the Japanese army, colluding with some Li XX's troops, and fighting against the government. You think he is shameless!</p>
