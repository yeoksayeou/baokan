<h3>鞏固郵基綱要建議案之成立梓</h3>
<p>郵政經濟制度研究委員會於前日通過「鞏固郵基方案實施綱要」而結束。吾人於該會成立以來之一年又二十天期間中。旣先讀其專門委員會報告書。得完全明瞭吾國郵政之情况。今更獲睹此建議案之因各方協作而完成。誠不勝欣幸矣。雖然，吾人今日之討論此事件。觀點尙不在此。</p>
<p>第一，郵政制度在吾國各項行政制度中。與海關制度。同以優良健全著稱。而海關行政。至今尙有一部分爲外人所掌握。郵政則自郵權收回以來。已成完全由吾國自行管理之交通行政。故雖謂郵務行政爲吾國行政之試金石。亦無不可。吾國改良行政制度。創議多年。至於今日。行政之完善。迄未能有逾於郵務海關。亦足見其事之非易也。數年以來。郵政制度。將發生動搖之消息。時見於報章。郵務員工乃有鞏固郵基之運動。降至去年。全國郵政人員。更不惜以罷工爲請願之手段。經上海各界領袖之調解。罷工結束。由行政院。函聘委員。研究鞏固郵基方。案以便建議於政府。由政府採納施行。今所通過之方案。就一方面言。不失爲一種結束鞏固郵基運動之完善工具。就另一方面言。則政府當局郵務員工與調解諸君維護此優良健全之行政制度之苦心所表現者也。</p>
<p>第。二鞏固郵基運動發動以來。經時五年。已成行政上困難之事件。郵務員工以破壞舊有完善制度爲慮。力爭不息交通當局。則認員工所爭者。涉及國家行政。不合正軌。兩力相持。不易折中。風潮發生之時。直接負郵務行政責任者如郵政總局局長交部郵政司長。且以處困難之地位。被免職扣留。此事件内容之嚴重性。灼然可見矣。卒以中央民訓會及實業部長飛行抵滬。妥爲處置。市長及各界領袖出而調解。第一步先行勸導復工。更以年餘之努力。制成此飽含妥協精神之方案。吾人以爲此方案内容之如何。可暫勿論。而其所形成之一種解决糾紛之方式。則在方今國家社會糾紛日出不窮之日。足以爲圖謀解决問題者所取法也。</p>
<p>吾人綜核鞏固郵基運動發生以來之事實。認此事件之完全解决。已達百分之九十以上之程度。深望政府之能早日採納實施。庶郵政制度。得一保障而不致動搖。並鼓勵社會。以妥協精神解决糾紛也。</p>

<h3>馬寅初之觀察</h3>
<p>南京馬寅初談、世界經濟會議之重要議程、爲安定幣價、放棄關稅政策、取消匯兌、限制提高物價四項、其實安定幣價、放棄關稅政策、取消匯兌限制、即所以提高物價、蓋提高物價、不能單獨成爲一問題、物價不能提高之原因、由於各國生產貨物不能流通達於國、外形成一地某物之生產過剩、不得不减價出售、而所以使貨物不能暢達流轉、世界上各國之關稅壁壘、與英美法之幣價戰爭、匯兌限制等種種政策所形成、目前歐美欲求挽救生產過剩失業恐慌之危機、惟有設法消滅此貿易障碍、始能濟事、世界各國各爲保障其自身之經濟起見、莫不高築關稅壁壘、以排斥外來之貨品、其結果徒使各國均不能明瞭各項物產品現存之數量、及隨時所需之數量、而作適當之生產支配、遂陷各國於無政府狀態下之生產形式、而造成今日至嚴重之生產過剩失業恐慌現象、且因關稅壁壘高築之故過剩者不能輸入缺乏者之國、需要者不能得多餘者之調劑貨物不能流通、產價過於低落、安定幣價各國最要之主張、即在恢復金本位、因恢復金本位後、一方面可免各國濫發不負責之紙幣、一方面幣制取同一單位後、可免各國各利用其不同與不定之幣價、以阻拒他國貨品進口之現象、英美對此當可趨於一致、法國則在取消人爲的支配、原則上即取銷匯兌限制、亦可贊同、幣價苟能安定、當可於商業匯兌上有一大保障、此亦流通貨品提高物價之一道、匯兌限制之採用、乃由於幣價之不能安定所以用此有工之方法、以報復他國所利用之幣價戰爭者也、此實與幣價問題同一爲流暢通貨之障礙、故欲求物價高、不能不取消匯兌限制、以上三種、皆所謂目前各國之重要財政政策、其原意在保護自身貿易、而結果乃釀成今日世界經濟破產之惨狀、戰債問題實一最嚴重之問題、且爲挽救經濟衰落之先决條件、如一日不能解决、則以上種種問題、必無一得能有圓滿結果、中國在此會議中、僅與銀價問題有較密切之關係、蓋中國關稅根本在他人支配之下、故無所謂關稅問題更無所謂幣制問題與匯兌問題至於銀價問題我國所希望者在銀價穩定、而美國對銀價希望提高如果中美合作解决此問題、必在「提高銀價然後穩定之之原則下解决之、惟目前美之銀價、已飛漲甚多、　匯兌上祇漲百分之十五、但從前美銀一盎斯、値美金兩角一分、而目前一盎斯且漲至美金三角七分、故每月上海銀行界運入美國之現銀、達三千萬元之鉅、此實値得吾人嚴重注意之一問題也、馬氏對世界經濟會議作一結論、謂該會之前途暗礁尙多、且各國代表之來、均未純焠爲經濟問題、結果不敢預測、惟多少總有結果、（十六日專電）</p>

<p>春秋苗人是猴子的尅星  瞻廬漢人，是苗人的尅星。中華民國的軍隊雖然比不上列强，但。和苗人打仗，畢竟勢如破竹；所以，廣西的猺變，在先，閙的聲勢滔天；一經正式軍隊開到，猺民便服服貼貼地向着漢人投降了。世界的民族，再也没有劣於苗民的了；苗民　了被征服者，當然不能再去征服其他的民族。然而苗民去捕捉猴子，却是拿手好戲；俗語說的好；「斧頭吃鑿子鑿子吃木頭；」鑿子吃了斧頭的苦　，便可在木頭上翻本尅星，苗人又做猴子的尅星。瓊州中央的黎母山，這是猴子的大本營；可惜猴子的智　，比着苗人差了許多，以致被征服於瓊島的苦人。苗人征服猴子的方法，是很簡單的；呌做一辣二黏辣的征服法，是把來懲治偷糧的猴子。只爲苗人所種的雜糧，待到成熟以後，部被猴子偷吃；甚至，一棵一棵的連根拔去。苗人恨極了，便想出一個辣的征服法。先把辣椒浸入水裏，浸的水中含有　烈的辣性，趁着黑夜，遍澆在所種的雜糧上面。待到晨露旣下，雜糧上面的露珠，也是一顆顆的含有辣性。猴子們又是成羣的來偷雜糧；一經搖撼，一顆顆的辣性露珠，都沾染到猴子眼睛裏；把猴子辣得不可忍耐，紛紛到溪流中去洗眼，不料愈洗愈辣，比受着流淚彈還得厲害，幾乎把眼睛都弄瞎了。苗人們趁猴子不能睜眼的當兒，簇擁上前很容易的把它們一鼓成擒了，這便是辣的征服法黏的征服法，是把來捕捉小猴子的。只爲母猴常常抱着小猴在磐石上坐，苗人把一種富有黏力的植物汁，悄悄的塗在磐石上面；算定母猴要來打坐的時候，他們躱在秘密處窺探動靜。笨不可言的母猴，又抱着小猴來坐磐石了，埋伏的苗人一聲呐喊，母猴待要逃走却被膠質黏住了屁股，休想可以起立。它便放掉了小猴子，用着全力來掙扎；母猴終於逃走了，但遺棄的小猴，已被苗人輕輕地抱去，這便是黏的征服法。玻牕裏的泥人  徐絜我們讀過日本歷史的，誰不曉得從前他們也是武人專權，和我們唐代的藩鎭跋扈，一般的景象。當我明朝成化（憲宗）的時候，他們有應仁之亂；萬曆（神宗）年間，有豐臣秀吉的專横；後來德川氏滅了豐臣氏，也是稱覇一時。到了明治，（清穆宗同治年間）因爲見了美艦駛入他們海岸，歐風美雨，東漸扶桑，也是他們國民性的特别優點，能夠憬然覺悟，努力維新。也是他們時來運凑，中國老朽腐敗，睡獅未醒；朝鮮李熙自立，内訌勿已；於是呑朝鮮，取琉球，敗中國，割台灣，成了他們「第一期的紅運。到了目下，我們貴國人稍稍有些蘇甦，丨也許是萬分之一，慢慢地伸個懶腰，揉揉眼睛，張大了口，打個欠呵，要起來了。矮子肚裏𤺥疙多，當然要打個寒噤。也是他們紅運當頭，蘇俄來玩赤色把戲，大爲世界所忌；别的大國，承了大戰之後，又閙着經濟問題，自顧不暇，外强中乾，這時不下手，還待何時。我來掉一句斯文道；「鳴呼此天之亡我，而日本之所以興也夫丨」這便是他們「第二期的紅運高照也就是我們貴國的一倒霉。」日本的紅運高照，當然要歸功於他們的軍閥所以他們軍閥，要趾高氣揚起來，這位荒木先生的威權，要比别的閣員不同了。據東京電訊說，他們日本人呼荒木以外的閣員，呌做「商店玻璃牕裏的泥人。」這是譏訕他們是「裝飾品」的意思。我想；商店玻璃牕裏的泥人，雖然没有實用，究竟還可以吸引顧客，招徠生意；我們玻璃牕裏的泥人，因爲不是東洋貨，大多數是江北人塑的泥人，像花臉官，大阿福，玄壇財神，小上墳戲裏的差官之類泥塑木雕，窳陋惡劣，眞令人見了作惡，望望然而去之，那裏可供兒童的玩賞呢。把泥人裝起金來，便成了莊嚴的「菩薩。」我們貴國人，最敬崇的，是菩薩；香燭供養，萬人膜拜，燒起長錠，焚起紙錢，來討菩薩的窩心，求菩薩的保佑。這也許是我們做小百姓的應盡的義務，菩薩應享的權利。菩薩之能否保佑小百姓，這是另一問題，毌須談起，也只有菩薩心裏自己明白吧了。因爲我們貴國人的心理，忒看重了菩薩，不敢來責備菩薩；所以菩薩之對内，只有「金剛的弩目；」菩薩之對外。不得不一菩薩之低眉了　午夜  傅之機聲，履聲，嘻笑聲，呌賣聲，喇叭聲，汽笛聲，兒童的爭吵聲，「杭育，杭育」的苦力們扛貨被壓榨出來的呼聲，　痺了久居城市的人們的耳朶，攬亂了抑鬰悲傷的人們的心緒，想求片刻的寗靜，唯有向着遠離交易市場的柏油馬路前進。東邊有幢四層西式的洋房，正門對着橫過的柏油路，柏油路和正門的中間，聯成一條水門汀的出入道，出入道的兩邊，各爲一片碧油油的草地，靠近柏油路的草地的盡頭，圍着一道士敏土的士的矮牆，呵原來是座極樂宮。進得門來，便是電梯，電梯的門口，懸着一塊「電梯暫停」的牌子；左手是灣曲扶梯，路上扶梯，便對着個廣大的會客廳，像死一般的靜寂；我坐在一張有彈性的沙發上休憇，向着頭頂的電扇，地下正中的紅木長　，四圍壁上的風景。建築物，和西洋女子裸體的一　的照片巡視，發呆。房子在震動了，四壁像電影開幕時的片子，漸漸烘托出一根根的白骨，俯視地下，舖滿了血和肉，我發抖了，舉着步履維艱的兩足向外逃奔，步下扶梯，走到門口，一個印度瘍三似的骷髏，迎頭向我猛撲上來。我的軀殼便霎時昏倒過去，甦醒過來還是躺在一張利用廢鐵製成的床上，汗涔涔地濕遍了短衫和褲子。「噹····噹····噹····」隔壁房裏的時鐘，正敲過十二下，寗波老王夫妻倆，正一高一低的吼着如雷的鼾聲；我的臂膊，臂部，怪難過的癢個不休，兩手隨着癢處搔去，隆然幾個豆子大的肉皰；恨極了，骨碌地爬起，掀了電燈的開關，向牠們肉搏，衝鋒，呵丨牠們總退却了，一個個鑽進戰濠裏去，結果是獲了少數的俘虜，用着「炮烙刑」將牠們分别正法，從此「風聲鶴唳」，戒備到黎明。短訊北京路浙江路口良晨好友社，舉行書家張枕綠之書畫合作扇展會，由張作書，諸家合作之畫有山水人物佛獸花鳥不等，出品千件，扇價分二元三元五元，此次購扇有贈奬助興，每件贈券一張，售完千件共贈券千張，内有百十六個奬額，頭奬獨得洋二百元，扇面分列於四馬路世界敎育用品社大衆書局棋盤街啟新書局利利文藝部，一律廉售贈奬，郵購　向良晨好友社，郵費每件一角，聞開幕三數日，售出甚夥，亦有乘此扇展期内定作大批，以充婚壽紀念及商店學校贈奬云長篇小說東北四連長  張恨水第九回謔語豈無由東床暗引突來良有以西席閑籌趙翁道；不反對是不反對，他總也没說什麽贊成的吧曼英笑道；您老人家，這可說的是外行話了。那個姑娘家自己肯說願意出閣的話。趙翁微笑道；那有什麽的不肯譬如黃小姐自己和田連長的事，有人問你，你能夠不說嗎曼英笑着搖了兩搖頭道；我們這種人，又當别論了。他說道話時，臉上微微的有些紅。趙翁一抱拳頭，笑道；我們不說笑話了。諸事都仰仗着黃小姐，您若是看着能說合的話，這就請您說合着。好在這兩家是院鄰，誰也知道誰家的事，用不着撒什麽謊的。曼英推開着風門，向前，院子裏張望了一下，然後帶上門來坐下，笑道；老太爺還是這樣大的嗓子說話，讓前面院子聽了去了，我這一條計，就不靈了。趙翁笑道；我的嗓子根本就是這樣大，這可没法子。說着，哈哈大笑了一陣。他不這樣，前面院子裏倒不注意，他一笑之後，桂枝首先聽着了，心裏想着，這個老頭子，人是很古板的，照說是不會和年輕姑娘開什麽玩笑的，何以和黃小姐說話，如此大笑。而且這種笑聲，是一種得意的樣子，莫不是黃小姐和他說的什麽話，讓他太高興了吧想到了這裏，自己想到院子裏來聽聽，可是礙着母親當面，又不好意思出來於是假裝着添白爐子裏的煤球，將爐子端到裏外院子的隔扇脚下，拿了一雙長火筷子，祗向爐子眼裏搗灰，兩隻耳朶，却是極力的向後院去聽着，聽得趙翁道；當花的錢，那總是要花的。那孩子也是個當家過日了的人衣服首飾這些話，那都好說。桂枝聽道這裏，却不由得心裏連連跳上了兩下心想，聽這種話頭。分明是和我作媒的那種話了。果然提的是我，話說到了這裏，就有了大八成了難道我就這樣的，默然受之，不說一句話嗎若是再不說一句話，我這件事恐怕就要成功了，到了那個時候；我再要說什麽不願的話，那就遲了。（一○二）象徵之夏小鳥母親這裏篤着禁止行獵怎樣這人仍舊可以打獵母鳥因爲他是林主的親戚閏房中的千金小姐　　爲錢袋而祼體</p>

<p>自由談論兒童讀物  珠聽說新書業中頗有企圖多編兒童讀物者。他們的目光大都注重於低年級的兒童讀物。這也許因爲低年級讀物在編印上較易觀成，而且客觀上的需要也很迫切；或者因爲民窮財盡的中國，一毛錢左右的小册子容易銷售，營業有把握或者因爲新書業困於財力，不得不從小做起。能够有計劃地編印兒童讀物，總是對於兒童有益的；但我的偏見總以爲目前需要最迫切者，倒是高年級的兒童讀物。而此項讀物中尤以關於科學的及歷史的讀物最爲缺乏。我常常這麽想；兒童的求知慾跟著年齡而發展，所以十一二歲的兒童假使不是低能的，就對於純文藝性的讀物感得單調了；而在文藝讀物中，他們又喜歡歷史的題材。同時他們的好奇心也發展到了合理的程度，對於宇宙萬象和新奇事物都要求合理的科學的解釋。他們不再相信神話中的事物起源的故事，他們扭住了母親，要她「說眞話」了可是要滿足兒童的歷史興趣和「說眞話」的要求，並不容易。太歷史性了，他們嫌枯燥；太科學的了，他們聽不懂。必須在歷史與科學的實質上加以文藝的外套，纔能使兒童滿足。蘇聯的童話幾點鐘（已有中文譯本）就是一個例子。雖則此書給十二歲的兒童閱讀尙覺程度高一點，可是那體裁値得我們學習。我以爲歷史的科學的高級兒童讀物在目前需要很急迫。我提出一個編輯計劃來供大家參考罷；字數；三萬到四萬。再少就不够叙述。題材；人體構造的槪論；各部器官的機構，作用，和衛攝；食物和衣服的種類及其衛生；這算是第一類。宇宙的起源，自然界的奇觀；煤，煤油，從那裏來人類怎樣征服自然這算是第二類。地球上各種人民的生活狀况，這是第三類。科學上的新發明，例如照相，電影，電報，電話，留聲機等等，這是第四類。關於歷史的，例如太平天國，義和團，鴉片戰爭，乃至孔子周遊列國等等，這是第五類了。體裁；自然要用文藝氣味濃厚的故事體了，比方講述食物或衣服的種類及其衛生時，就可以從原始人喫什麽穿什麽講起，把人類衣食的歷史包括進去；講到我們現在的衣食時，就可以叙述主要衣食原料的生牽手續。同時各種類的題材也應該有聯繫，譬如耳官的機構和作用可以和電話的構造原理聯繫起來，眼睛和照相機聯繫起來。歷史的題材如孔子周遊列國，應該描寫那時的社會政治經濟，並且要把這位「大成至聖先師」還原爲當時那位栖栖皇皇急於做官的凡人。本來是出題目容易，做文章難，尤其是兒童讀物，文章要深入淺出。但是我相信旣有了需要，就會發生事實。被囿的美  林微音就是在奇禽異獸所彙集的動物園中，孔雀還覺得自己是最美麗的。他有畫師所畫不出的圖案，的調不出的色彩；他有詩人所詠不出的音韻與節奏；他有音樂家所奏不出的和諧。虹的色澤是自他得到的啓示；太陽是爲他才燦爛。他有美的一切。他是一切的美。可是在現在，他是在動物園中。雖然他還有美的一切，還是一切的美，然而這樣被囿着，這只是一顆在一個墟墓中的夜明珠，一個在一個暴王的後宮中的妃子。他受到太陽的嘲笑，虹的奚落。雖說他還覺得自己是最美麗的生物，却不能稍减去他心中被囿的悲哀；而且因爲他還這樣覺到，他的心中的悲哀更是無限的，無盡的。他原想撕破他的美，棄除他的華飾，可是在他的喙將啄到他的第一支羽毛的時候，他會憐憫着自己，姑息着自己，而終着他的喙的前進，他不願摧殘自己。他要留着它給自己讚歎。他時常地開着屏，那整齊的圖案，那濃郁的色彩使他自己喜悅，使他得到刹那的快慰。他最愛看那兩邊翅翼下的羽絲，像水仙的睫毛般柔軟地下埀着。他便驕傲地旋轉着他的步武，在向虚無炫耀着他的美。可是正在屏盛開着的中間，他會突然感到他儘這樣只向自己誇示，似乎也没有什麽意味丨丨他便顫動他的每一支羽毛，像灑着一陣殞星的密雨，接着凄楚地哀鳴了兩聲，便無聲地收下了他的翅翼。竊犯馬國亮  馬國亮早上回到編輯室，翻開申報，擘頭便看見香港大英銀行買辦房所登的懸賞追緝竊犯馬國亮的大字標題廣告。在「竊犯馬國亮像」之下，印着如下的字句；一馬國亮廣東台山縣人年二十七八歲於國歷六月二日盜竊香港大英銀行港紙銀五萬元私逃無踪如有能引拿歸案者即謝花紅銀二千元如當場搜獲現銀若干抽出二成充賞决不食言此佈····」等字樣。雖然有人預測過將來人們都會廢除了姓名而代以號碼，可是現大還不曾見諸實行。中國四五萬萬的人口，大家的名字都是同一在一本字典裏選出來的，四五萬萬個名字，自然時時會遇到雷同的偶然。不過我和這位馬國亮的凑巧地方，便是我自己也是廣東人（不過我是　德縣人而不是台山縣的罷了）我今年是二十六歲，和這位宗兄的「年二十七八」，實在也相差無幾。不僅姓名巧合，而且籍貫和年齡也差不多，世界之大，眞是無「巧」不有了。看完了報紙，接着來的便是相識和未識的朋友們紛紛詢問的電話（固然他們不會懷疑我這　馬國亮便是那個馬國亮的，不過當爲趣事談談而己。）有些更爲我設想週全，勸我在賞格旁邊登一個解釋誤會的啟事。朋友們善意的關懷至足感謝的，不過說到登啟事解釋，我以爲無須多此一舉。人家旣不是追緝自己，自己又何必嘵嘵置　呢世間没有絶對的善惡。爲功爲罪，也看各人的立塲而言。囂俄的ＬｅｓＭｉａｅｒａｂｌｅｓ一書中，主人翁約翰因爲要養活自己的幾個外甥，而去偷别人的麵包，結果被禁牢裏，談到這裏，誰不爲他抱不平吳用計刦了生辰綱，梁山泊稱他好漢，而朝廷却行文緝捕他們，可知善惡是没有一定標準的。這一位馬國亮爲什麽要偷去五萬元的欵子在不知道他的内幕眞相的我，雖不至爲他辯護，但我决不會便怨玷辱了我的名字。有人要犯罪而偷錢，這不單是他個人的恥辱而該是全人類的恥辱罷。人們不能各自滿足地生活，卒至有人挺而走險犯法，這詛咒該落在誰人的頭上看看這世界罷，天天在進行着的那一宗不是偷騙搶掠的事不過手段各有巧妙不同，身份高低不同而己。没力量的偷竊後給人追緝，有力量的搶刦後依然安穩無事。不信且看許多被刦掠而至於不能生存的人，難道他們還能拿出兩千塊錢去懸賞緝獲他們的主犯麽竊鈎者誅，竊國者侯，滔滔者天下皆是，你能怨懟得許許多多麽前兩天到楊樹浦去，經過一座宏大壯麗的建築物，問起同行的友人才知道這是監獄，當時不僅惋惜這美麗宏壯的建築却是人類「羞恥的象　」（見翌子愷先生語），而且心裏想，那關在裏面的人不一定全是當眞犯罪的罷。而我們，那造遙在牢獄之外的我們，難道個個都是赤子般的淸白，没有一個人有關進牢裏的資格麽在善惡難分的這年頭兒，我又何必在報上登啟事自表淸白，來對照這一位同姓名的不幸的同胞呢二千塊錢確是一個不小的數目。我有許多親友們都在顚連困苦着，如其是可能的話，我倒願意把我自已這一個無用的人去引拿歸案，好讓我的可憐的親友們得着兩千塊錢而舒服一下子，我至多也不過坐坐牢，也是很値得的罷，我想。關於放屁文學  何如「雖則放屁，也是文學。」頃見某刋物載有胡懷琛之薩坡賽路上雜記十二，放屁文學（已見蘧廬絮語）校勘記，謂蔣子正山房隨筆所載之詠屁時一視之不見名曰希，聽之不聞名曰夷。不啻若自其口出，人皆掩鼻而過之。前二句出自老子·然略有錯誤。且謂屁原有聲，不能說聽之不聞。應依老子原文改作視之不見名曰夷，摶之不得名曰微。不啻若自其口出，人皆掩鼻而過之。按此公嘗改嘗試集内之詩遭受胡聖人一場奚落。又嘗改柳宗元文，大受王雲六曉風及玄之譏笑。今復師心自用，奮筆以改林神童之轉失氣詩，是亦不可以已乎紅蘿蔔鬚  Ｊｕｌｅｓｋｅｎａｒｏ作林取譯第一隻山鷸「站在這裏，」雷辟克說，「這是個頂好的地方。我帶着狗到樹林裏面去走走；我們把山鷸」趕出來，你聽到Ｐｊｔｐｉｔ的呌聲時，便要竪起耳朶，睜開眼睛啦。山鷸會從你的頭上飛過的。」紅蘿蔔鬚把獵槍抱在懷中。有生以來這是第一次預備去打一隻山鷸。他曾經用着雷辟克的槍打死過一隻鶉，打落下幾根竹鷄毛，打跑了一隻野兎。他打中那隻鶉是伏在地上，伏在聳立着的獵犬的鼻子底下打的。他起初瞧着丨可是並没有看淸丨那同土一樣顏色的小小的團。「退後點，」雷辟克對他說，「你離得太近了。」可是紅蘿蔔鬚却本能地更前進了一步，把槍靠在肩上，隔得很近的開了火，把那灰色的小球打進地裏面去了。他祗尋到那打碎了的消失了的一些羽毛和一隻血淋淋的嘴。但一個靑年獵人想要成名的話，莫如打死一隻山鷸，所以紅蘿蔔鬚應當使得這個夜晚在他的一生裏面有大筆特書的價値。黃昏時候很容易把東西看錯的。這時候，什麽東西都朦朧起來。一隻蚊子飛過可以像雷聲走近來一樣擾亂我們。因此，紅蘿蔔鬚很感動的站在那裏，希望事情快點完結。幾隻畫眉鳥從牧塲回來，很快地飛進橡樹裏面去了。他對牠們瞄準着，練習眼力。他用衣袖揩着那使槍管黯淡起來的水氣。這裏那裏　下一些落葉。來了，畢竟有兩隻山鷸出現了，牠們那長嘴使得牠們飛起來都不靈活似的，牠們從地面飛起，卿卿我我地追逐着，在那微顫着的樹林上盤旋着牠們正像雷辟克所說的一樣，發出ｐｉｔｐｉｔ的呌聲，可是呌得非常低，弄得紅蘿蔔鬚疑心牠們没有飛到自己身邊來。他連連閃動着他的兩眼他看見兩個影子從他的頭上經過，於是他把槍柄靠在肚子上，對着空中狠準的開了一槍，。兩隻山鷸中之一隻落下來了，嘴巴向前，那驚人的槍聲從樹林的四圍發出回響。紅蘿蔔鬚把那翅膀已被打碎的山鷸檢起，意氣洋洋地搖動着，嗅着火藥的氣味。皮拉麥在雷辟克前面跑着，雷辟克是像平常一樣不慢也不快地走着。「他一定大吃一驚，」紅蘿蔔鬚想，準備受到一番誇奬。可是雷辟克分開樹枝，走了出來，以一種沉着的聲音，對他那身上還有火藥氣味的兒子說道；「你爲什麽没有把兩個一起打落下來呢」釣鈎紅蘿蔔鬚正在破着他自己釣來的那些魚，那裏面有河沙魚，有銀白魚，還有鱸魚。他用刀子刮去牠們的鱗，剖開牠們的肚腹，用脚踏破牠們那透明的氣胞。他把魚臟集在一處預備喂貓。他急急忙忙地埋頭工作着，把身子伏在那滿是白沫的桶上，留心着不把自己一身弄濕。雷辟克家的跑來看一眼「這才做得　啦，」她說，「你給我們釣到了一餐煎魚啦，今天。祗要你願意的話，你是可以釣得很好的。」她撫摸着他的頸和肩膀，可是，當她把手收回來的時候，她一連發出幾個痛苦的呌聲。一個釣鈎刺進了她的指尖。姐兒愛勒絲丁連忙跑來，大哥斐利克斯跟在她後面一會兒連雷辟克先生也來了。「把手拿出來看看，」他們說。但她把她的手捺在她的裙上，夾在兩膝之間，釣鈎因而進去得更深了。當大哥斐利克斯和姐兒愛勒絲丁扶住她的時候，雷辟克便抓着她的手臂，高高舉起，於是大家都可以見着。釣鈎已把她的指頭刺　對穿。（未完）</p>

<p>東林黨莫說東林黨，當年氣盛時，要知魏氏罪，合誦寺人詩，志士皆誅斥，良心各背馳，烽烟東北起，還復自猜疑。贈抗日諸將士效命沙塲鐵騎騰，國家多難寇氛凌，英雄宜向軍前死，莫對河梁吊李陵。寄塞外征人春殘時作别後長亭草色冥，殘春敗絮滿窗檽，遙知漠北天時冷，折柳還須笛裏聽。梟  匡貝夜是那麽的闇黑，又是那麽的漫漫，一隻梟落在後林的枝柯上不時的發出「咯···咯···快咯快咯」的呌鳴，充分的顯示出夜的陰霾，恐怖。相傳梟是一種最不吉祥的飛禽，牠的含有哀悱的呌鳴，好像「噹噹噹」的喪鐘，是禍難將臨的朕兆，誰也聽了討厭，誰也詛咒牠的存在。但不知牠這倒是新的啟示，也是摧毁一切舊魔的車輪。一個老年人暈迷着睡不下去，爬下了床，摸索着那麽一管古舊的拐杖，走出後門，扔力地把杖在石階上敲，同時發出這樣的喊呌；「你遠走高飛吧丨夜已深了，我還得安睡一息。」梟不呌了，睜大着貓眼似的雙瞳，烱烱地，一箭高飛去了。老年人帶着一種異樣的心情，退進屋來，聽見滿屋子人，鼾聲哄然，但他依舊睡不着，梟不呌了，屋簷裏的麻雀却又「吱吱喳喳的」的了，張眼望了望窗子，也由漆黑變成暗灰色了。他由這梟的呌鳴聯想起了許多往事。「那一年，許有一個月，每夜牠都呌個不休，駡也駡不去，槍射也射不去，也就任憑牠呌。不多久，村上變成了另一個世界。老百姓的臉袋全都泛着紅暈的笑渦，那麽慶幸，那麽豪興。而平昔闊綽的財老公，却氣悶得一點聲息都没有了，有些甚至星夜趕路，逃避到遠遠的地方去。光前老爺平時是那麽的瞧不起人，都降級來我這兒談天，說；「即使是眞的，也得和平些幹！」我當然明白他的語意，全不置可否，不料他竟疑想我有歪意，從此不再來了，只是悶在家裏，時常喊着「聽天由命。」眼見「自衛軍」已在開始組織了，「農會」更在淸查富家的穀擔，打定平糶給一些貧民，一切都不像從前了。這時我曾想到過梟呌的道理，牠那呌原是呌破富人的不祥，怎的牠竟來我的後林呌到一個月之久？呀，也要是這樣；牠除了宣布富人的厄運，同時還來告訴我有飯吃了，所以牠飛來我的後林那麽呌得起動，牠的呌，倒是我們的福音呵！但有一次却呌壞了，也許有一個月，每晚都不停地呌着，駡也駡牠不去，打也打牠不去。誰也想不到又是怎樣的一種朕兆。當時家裏只有大媳婦是雙身人，聽說懷了八個月的孕，難道牠就以這個作對象呌，難道這個也有什麽亂子出？我只想牠是呌我們小心，快就有肥胖的孫子抱了。這眞壞了，大兒的娘抽咽着走來說；「小產，唉，小產！」我連忙爬下床，從暈厥中摸了一把柴刀把後園的樹砍。樹還没胃砍斷，梟却飛走了。至於說到這次，想來想去，自己家裏並没有什麽禍難的隱伏，只想這世界會有一次比那年的來得穩定的亂子出現。光前老爺是死去了。只看還誰會來我這兒談天，說些「要和平些」的話。昨日縣裏上來人，帶來過不少的各種各樣的消息，最扼要的一句是說城裏已發動了。」闇黑，漫漫的夜幕撤了，天已全亮。上海的三種老爺（續）  影呆㈢巡捕老爺最後要說巡捕老爺，當了巡捕，也是非常神氣，具有無上的權威，在馬路上，看見了買靑菜蘿蔔的人，會任意的把脚踢翻，没有照會，抓住了小販，行裏去，那時小販會苦苦的哀求，老爺長，老爺短，說個不休，但終於請你到行裏去了。黃包車夫見了巡捕，好比是見了閻羅王，一個不好，就會被巡捕打兩棍，拍幾下耳光，弄得不好，還要撬你照會，罰你五毛大洋。拿着棍子在馬路上巡　，許多的小販，老遠看見他跑來，已是四散的奔跑了，所謂肅靜廻避。雖無硬牌，却已實行。電車在中途向例不停止，但有巡捕要上下，司機人會隨時開門。跟着外國人走進了電車，錢板了面孔抄巴子，坐在電車裏的人，個個要立起來被他們抄過，但那時坐電車的人，總是貼貼服服，一切的一切無非是巡捕老爺的權威呢！店員通訊一個好消息我們以前接到許多店員的來信；有的說找不到位置，有的說没有求學的機會。有的說在敵人所設的店舖裏辦事，心中不願，也有說所做的事業，太没有意味。我們接到了這一類的信，回答起來，最感困難；因爲在整個不景氣的社會，没有辦法以前，這種各個人的問題，簡直没有解救的方法。現在好了；中華國貨產銷合作協會，已與漢口路Ｂ字九號，中華職業補習學校商妥，在該校創辦「靑年店員夜校訓練班」一所。凡在該校畢業，成績優良之學生，均由該會設法介紹。查該會已在國内各大埠，設有分會十餘處，並有會員工廠及商店八十餘家，需才孔多，將未畢業生之出路，必能暢達。且以極低廉之學費，在最短期間，能得許多切要的學識。誠我靑年店員們的好消息也。茲將其招生章程列后；中華國貨產銷合作協會靑年店員夜校訓練班招生章程㈠宗旨招收有志靑年店員授以新知予以訓練養成推銷國貨健全份子㈡課程訓練班之課程如左珠算二應用文二商業常識三商業簿記四商業道德一㈢期限訓練班之修業期爲三個月㈣資格入學資格如左㈠須年十六歲以</p>

<h3>Hopeful Conclusion of the Chahar Incident</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiyong and Lei Jishang Return to Beiping from Zhangjiakou to Report, Song Zheyuan Expresses Satisfaction with Feng's Proposed Opinions, He Yingqin Immediately Sends Urgent Telegrams to the Central Government and Chiang Kai-shek for Instructions, Song Waits for Reply from Nanjing to Proceed to Chahar for Settlement, Sun Dianying to be Appointed as Reclamation Director</p>
<p>Chiang Approves, Sun Agrees</p>
<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan's representative Zhang Jiyong and Feng Yuxiang's representative Lei Jishang, etc., returned to Beiping last night and immediately met with Song to report. Pang Bingxun, Qin Decun, Xiong Bin, etc., were all present. Song expressed considerable satisfaction with Feng's opinions. After further discussions among Song and others, additional opinions were added to Feng's proposed solutions. Xiong then relayed them to He Yingqin, who immediately sent urgent telegrams to the Central Government and Chiang Kai-shek to report and request instructions that evening. Today, He, Huang, Song, and others continued to discuss this issue. It is rumored that Han Fuju will also participate in the discussion. It is expected that once the Central Government and Chiang Kai-shek's replies arrive in Beiping, a final decision on the Chahar incident can be made. Feng currently only insists on arrangements for Sun Dianying, Fang Zhenwu, Deng Wen, and several other units. It is rumored that the authorities have already internally decided to grant Sun the title of Reclamation Director, etc. The Military Affairs Commission has decided to reorganize Deng Wen's and other volunteer armies in the same way as other volunteer units, so there are no problems. The nominal designation can also be considered for placement. The Chahar Bureau is expected to temporarily conclude. Song will return to Chahar to handle the aftermath within days after receiving the Central Government and Chiang Kai-shek's replies. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Appointed Reclamation Director</h3>
<p>Beiping appoints Sun Dianying as Qinghai Reclamation Director. Previously, He telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. Chiang replied to He, stating that Sun's army reclaiming land in Qinghai to consolidate border defenses was highly commendable. Chiang requested that Sun's consent be obtained immediately and an official announcement be made. He then instructed the army's office in Beiping to seek Sun's opinion. The office received a telegram from Sun from the front lines, stating that reclaiming the Northwest was the long-held aspiration of his army and requesting that it be conveyed to Minister He. The office director, Wang Shiping, and Sun's representative, Hu Jiesan, visited He at the Military Affairs Commission this afternoon to convey Sun's opinion and requested that the official announcement be made soon due to the long distance from Chahar to Qinghai.

<h3>Fang Zhenwu Responsible for Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>Beiping Regarding the reorganization of Deng Wen's and other units, the government plans to send Ma Zhanshan to Pingdiquan to organize and implement a unified system and also plans to appoint Fang Zhenwu as the Commander for Bandit Suppression in Eastern Chahar, responsible for suppressing bandits.

<p>He Yingqin Convenes Meeting</p>
<h3>To Discuss Recovering Lost Territories of Various Counties</h3>
<p>Rumor Has It That The Authorities Already Have A Plan For Handling Puppet Troops</p>
<p>Areas Withdrawing From Japanese Troops Will Temporarily Be Maintained By Local Police</p>
<p>Special Police To Be Organized By The Hebei Provincial Government Before Officially Taking Over</p>
<p>Beiping At 10:30 AM this morning, He Yingqin convened a meeting at Fengzeyuan. Huang Fu, Yu Xuezhong, Xiong Bin, Song Zheyuan, etc., all participated to comprehensively discuss the handling of puppet troops and the recovery of lost territories of various counties. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. Yu Xuezhong stated that he came to attend the Political Reorganization Committee and will return in two or three days. Regarding the handling of the Tianjin puppet troops, Li Jichun and others hoped: 1. That after our reorganization, a force of 10,000 men would be retained. 2. That they would continue to be stationed in Luandong. After investigation, the unit actually has fewer than 10,000 men. If their request is granted, it would inevitably attract bandits to supplement them, making reorganization more difficult. After the recovery of the counties in Luandong, everything needs to be reorganized. If they are allowed to remain stationed in Luandong, it would hinder local reception, administrative reorganization, and progress. Therefore, the location of their station still needs to be re-negotiated. The Japanese troops in Tongzhou have withdrawn in different directions towards Sanhe and Zunhua. The Japanese troops on the northern route have also concentrated from Shunyi towards Gubeikou. Because the special police have not yet been organized in the areas where the Japanese troops have withdrawn, they are all maintained by local public security police. They will be officially taken over after the special police are formed. The special police will be organized by the Hebei Provincial Government, and work has not yet started. The number of personnel should be sufficient to maintain local peace and stability after being dispatched to various counties. Of the nineteen county magistrates of the lost territories, seventeen have reported to the provincial government, except for two who fled. After recovery, county magistrates of counties where the entire territory was lost, such as Zunhua and Qian'an, will be replaced by others. County magistrates of counties where the entire territory was not lost will continue to be held by the original incumbents. All candidates have been assigned and will follow to take office when the reception begins. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping An authority in Beiping stated that there is already a plan for handling puppet troops, but it will not be announced for the time being. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Yu Xuezhong told reporters that although the Hebei Provincial Government has appointed the nineteen county magistrates of Luandong, they have not been able to take office because the problem of the "Manchukuo" army has not been resolved. Although the Chinese side is currently in contact with Japanese military officer Nagatsu regarding this matter, this issue is quite difficult and may take some time to resolve. Yu also stated that plainclothes teams in Tianjin are still extremely active, so the martial law in Tianjin cannot be lifted for the time being. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping According to reliable sources from foreigners, the Japanese army's retreat to the Great Wall seems to be continuing. Approximately four military vehicles drive towards the Great Wall via Qinhuangdao every day, but Li Jichun's "Manchukuo" army has not moved yet, so people are still uneasy. Currently, Li Jichun's army is stationed along the railway line north of Lutai and in various places between the Luan River. It is now widely rumored that Shi Yousan has new activities in that area, so people feel even more unsettled. Because the Japanese side is unwilling to withdraw them and the Chinese side cannot implement expulsion because the ceasefire agreement stipulates that the Chinese army must not cross the Lutai line, the Chinese side feels quite difficult. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Flies Over Tongzhou for Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>Beiping There is no change in the situation near Lutai. The puppet army in Ninghe also has not taken much action. After the Japanese troops withdrew from Tongzhou, more than 60 Japanese soldiers suddenly returned to the Yanjiao area in several armored vehicles at around 3 PM yesterday and went east again at around 6 PM. This morning, a Japanese plane came to Tongzhou for reconnaissance and then flew away. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat from Niulanshan to Miyun</h3>
<p>Beiping Shunyi reports that most of the Japanese troops stationed in the Niulanshan and Huairou area have withdrawn to Miyun, but a few Japanese troops are still stationed in the Shayukou and Yangjiabanjian area on the northwestern border of Shunyi. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tanggu Martial Law Time Shortened</h3>
<p>Beiping Someone from Tanggu stated that the Japanese plainclothes teams there will soon be heading outside the pass. Tanggu is peaceful, and the martial law time there has also been reduced to starting at 12:00 AM. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation After the Looting of Gubeikou</h3>
<p>Beiping Someone from Gubeikou stated that many local people died in the recent battle of Gubeikou, and all their belongings were lost. In Chaheguan alone, more than 81 people were massacred by the Japanese and then burned. The corpses were left unattended for more than 20 days, which was very tragic. Later, the local maintenance committee supervised the laborers to bury them. Of the more than 100 houses in Chaheguan, only five or six remain due to the burning. The Luanping County has now sent a section chief to establish an administrative office in Gubeikou, with three sections in the office. There is a plan to demarcate the area from Qingshiliang to Shixiazhen as a county. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Troops in Luandong Commit All Kinds of Evil</h3>
<p>Beiping According to someone from Tangshan, since Li Jichun's puppet troops have occupied Luandong, they have been disturbing the local area and committing all kinds of evil. Li's puppet headquarters is currently located in the Jiaotong University in Tangshan, and there is no sign of retreat. Li is originally from Fengrun, Hebei. In the past, he was expelled from his hometown by the villagers for committing numerous evils. Recently, he has been working for the tiger, relying on violence to oppress the villagers. He even vents his anger on other counties. Anyone with a slight reputation in the villages is killed to vent his anger. As for arbitrary levies, rapes, and looting, they are particularly severe. Now the people in the counties of Luandong are in dire straits, and they eagerly hope that the national army will resolutely solve the puppet troops and save the people.

<h3>Actively Carrying Out Incitement Towards Mongolia</h3>
<p>Even Wanting to Convene a So-Called Manchuria-Mongolia Conference</p>
<p>In Order to Carry Out Their Attempt to Invade Mongolia</p>
<p>Beiping After the Japanese forcibly occupied the four northeastern provinces, they are again actively inciting Mongolia, wanting to implement the entire Manchuria-Mongolia policy. It is rumored that the Japanese have decided to convene a Japan-Manchuria-Mongolia conference in a certain place on the Great Wall or in Shenyang at the end of July or the beginning of August this year. The main purpose of the conference is nominally to discuss the political and economic relations between the two sides, but in reality, it is to discuss various convenient strategies for the Japanese side to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. After the conference, Japan will decide to send a large number of military and political personnel deep into the Mongolian hinterland to carry out incitement policies in an attempt to seize Mongolia.

<p>The Japanese Are Devising Various Plans</p>
<h3>To Seize Land in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Beiping Shenyang reports that the Japanese are using various cruel means in the Northeast to seize land in the Eastern Provinces. The East Asia Immigration Corporation is moving Korean people to various places in the Eastern Provinces. First, they move several or dozens of them. Then, the Japanese use the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to form a self-defense force. The purpose of this is to: 1. Protect Japanese overseas Chinese. 2. Disguise themselves as bandits to attack the Chinese in the village, making them unable to live in peace and forcing them to flee, transferring the land to the Japanese. Otherwise, they instigate ruffians to forge land ownership certificates, secretly planting specimens in the area and establishing a ferry contract with the Japanese, and registering it with the government, not stopping until they seize the land.

<h3>Establish Management Committee for Control and Supervision</h3>
<p>Nanjing The Legislative Yuan held its 22nd meeting of the third session at 9:00 AM on the 16th. President Sun Ke, Secretary-General Liang Han Cao, and more than 50 members, including Lü Zhiyi, attended. President Sun Ke. The matters discussed were as follows:</p>
<p>1. Deliberation and amendment of the draft Electricity Business Regulations. Resolved: Referred to the Economic Committee for review.</p>

<p>5. The Legislative Committee of this Yuan, together with the Finance Committee, reported on the review of the draft Organizational Charter of the Railway Ministry's Unified Accounting and Statistics Committee. Resolved: Passed in accordance with the review report. This regulation does not need to go through the legislative process. (16th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing The Legislative Yuan deliberated and approved the contract for the purchase of cotton, wheat, and flour loans. It was submitted to the 22nd meeting for discussion and passage on the 16th. It is learned that the deliberation of this case by the Yuan went through the following circumstances: This case was sent to the Legislative Yuan by the Central Political Council on the 9th and was handed over to the Finance and Economic Committees for review. After completing the review on the 14th and 15th, it was submitted to the 22nd Yuan meeting on the 16th for careful discussion. Because the original proposal had already been passed by the Central Political Council, the discussion paid close attention to the custody and use, especially focusing on the use in productive enterprises. After much debate, the original proposal was passed, and the attached conditional plan was resolved as follows: 1. The loan management committee is responsible for the custody, control, and supervision, and is organized by the following personnel: (A) Five government representatives, filled by the heads of the five Yuans. (B) Six representatives pushed by the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. The organizational charter of the aforementioned management committee will be determined separately. 2. The entire use of the loan revenue is limited to the following productive enterprises and may not be transferred to any domestic military operations or other consumption: (A) Establishment and development of basic industries (B) Restoration of the rural economy (C) Construction of water conservancy projects (D) Development of important transportation projects. The loan management committee shall determine the allocation of shares in accordance with the above clauses and in accordance with legislative procedures. (16th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing Central News Agency reporters learned that the full text of the 50 million US dollar loan contract signed by Finance Minister Song in the United States has not yet been mailed to Nanjing. The Central Political Council and the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 16th were based on the main points of the contract for discussion. The use, custody, and supervision were attached with conditions. The Legislative Yuan has reported the entire case to the National Government and forwarded it to the Central Political Council. It is rumored that the attached conditions are extremely reasonable, and the Central Political Council will definitely accept them. After the Central Political Council accepts the conditions, the loan will be formally established. Another Legislative Yuan commissioner told the Central News Agency reporters that the advantages and disadvantages of the loan depend on how it is allocated. At this time of internal and external pressure in our country, being able to borrow huge sums of money has a huge impact on international credit. Although cotton and wheat are not as useful as machinery and agricultural implements, the need for cotton is also extremely urgent. If this money can be used entirely for production, it may not be a good opportunity for our country's revival, but if it is used improperly, it will be harmful and unhelpful. Therefore, when the Legislative Yuan passed this case, it first paid attention to the use, custody, and supervision and attached extremely reasonable conditions, which should be accepted by the government.

Others, such as Wang Shuhan, Liu Zhe, Zhang Zhitan, Wang Yitang, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Han Fuju, Yu Xuezhong, Jiang Menglin, Tang Erhe, Song Zheyuan, and Lu Dangping, have already arrived in Beiping one after another, except for those who are in Beiping.

<p>Beiping Fu Zuoyi arrived in Beiping from Changping tonight to attend the establishment meeting of the Political Committee on the 17th. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Reorganization Committee, recently declared to our agency reporters that the North China Political Committee was appointed by the Central Executive Yuan and is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. There are approximately twenty-three members of the committee, including the chairmen of the governments of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces. Huang Fu also said that the ceasefire agreement recently signed in Tanggu has been approved by the central government, so this matter will not be discussed at the meeting tomorrow. Its agenda is limited to internal work, especially the issue of cooperation between the authorities of the North China provinces. Several days ago, Huang Fu and He Yingqin both declared that Japan would withdraw its troops and did not want to stay south of the Great Wall, forcing China to recognize the de facto situation created in northern China by military actions since September 1931 during the peace negotiations. This kind of optimistic declaration is very different from the worries of most Chinese people in North China, which makes us pay attention. Regarding Feng Yuxiang's actions, Huang Fu said that the negotiations with Feng have not yet been completed, but he hopes to achieve good results. When Huang Fu made this declaration, it was rumored in Beiping that Feng Yuxiang had recruited 20,000 people and organized them into his own direct command army. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>

Now that the Political Reorganization Committee is not holding a ceremony and the area under the jurisdiction of the Political Reorganization Committee announced by the central government the day before yesterday is limited to the areas of Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin, Chairman Han's responsibilities have been reduced again. However, as a political commissioner, he came to participate. Since Feng's telegram was sent on the 26th, Han has not made any expressions, because he only knows how to obey the orders of the central government, adhere to the purpose of protecting the country, suppressing bandits, and resisting strong enemies, and does not ask about other matters. He will stay in Beiping for about four or five days and then return to Jinan. (16th dispatch)</p>

<p>The Central Government Holds</p>
<h3>Memorial for Premier's Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Reports on the Premier's Spirit of Struggle</p>
<p>Nanjing The Central Government held a memorial meeting for the 11th anniversary of the Premier's martyrdom in Guangzhou at 8:00 AM on the 16th. Middle-level committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Zhu Peide, Chen Guofu, and representatives from all staff members and agencies, totaling more than 700 people, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting, and Sun Ke delivered a report, mainly stating that eleven years ago, the Premier swore an oath in Guilin to launch the Northern Expedition, while Chen Jiongming colluded secretly with the warlords and plotted to change things. And when the Premier's troops were in Shaoguan, Chen made more obstructionist moves, and the signs of rebellion became more obvious. The Premier wanted to use sincerity to influence the rebels, but they remained obstinate. Finally, on this day eleven years ago, they besieged the marshal's mansion, causing the incident of the Premier's martyrdom in Guangzhou. In August of that year, the Premier went to Shanghai and struggled with an indomitable spirit, which enabled the Northern Expeditionary Army to enter Fujian from Jiangxi and finally recovered Guangzhou by the end of the eleventh year. Now, our country is under internal and external pressure, which is no less than that of the past. We should follow the Premier's spirit to resolve the current difficulties of the country. Throughout history, only those who do not revolt and the masses who do not have a leader in a disorganized manner will suffer the disaster of national subjugation. It has never been heard of that the masses who are organized and led by a revolutionary party are worried about national subjugation. I hope that everyone will give full play to the spirit of the Premier in Guangzhou, so that the revolutionary forces can be enriched throughout the country. (16th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Held a Subcommittee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Research on the First Draft Extended by Two Weeks</p>
<p>Nanjing The Constitutional Drafting Committee held a subcommittee meeting on the 16th.

It was also decided to add a land item to the people's livelihood chapter and to assign Wu Shangying to be responsible for the research. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Talks About Recent Events</h3>
<p>Central Political Council Plans to Issue a Declaration on Cotton and Wheat Loans</p>
<p>The Chahar Incident Dispute Can Be Completely Resolved Within Days</p>
<p>Nanjing Wang Jingwei said that the Central Government has always been committed to the purpose of developing productive enterprises for the US cotton and wheat loan and has strictly controlled the custody, disclosed the use, and carefully controlled it, and will never use it for domestic military operations or other consumption. The General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan today has passed the original proposal attached to the conditions submitted by the Political Council. According to the attachments, a loan management committee will be established. The representatives of the committee will be organized by the heads of the five Central Yuans and the representatives publicly elected by the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. They are responsible for the custody, control, and supervision. It can be seen that the government's spirit is purely for the sake of developing national production. The Guangdong Political Committee's previous joint telegram to the US government, pointing out that the Central Government's loan would be used for internal wars, was purely a propaganda with other purposes. However, the US government is very clear about our government's enthusiasm for developing mutually beneficial production between the two sides, so the opposition from the southwest has no impact on the establishment of the loan. In order to make the people of the country understand and dispel the concerns of a few people, the Central Political Council will issue a declaration to show caution. As for the Chahar incident, the people of the country have dispelled their doubts since Feng's telegram was issued. The Central Government has decided to resolve the dispute by peaceful means. After many days of mediation, there has been progress and it can be completely resolved within one or two days. Feng's personal whereabouts are not a problem, but his newly formed army must have a way to be placed. The ongoing consultations are also for this purpose. Reports that the administrative personnel of Chahar Province and that Feng will be appointed as the Director of Northwest Reclamation are all under consultation and have not been fully determined.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>＝Rapid Development of Negotiations＝P] The London World Economic Conference is paying close attention to the rapid progress toward currency stabilization. It is reported tonight that the U.S. delegation has agreed to de facto stabilize the dollar exchange rate at the current price (i.e., one British pound equals slightly more than four U.S. dollars). According to the London Evening Standard, the Bank of England unexpectedly notified banks and stock exchange brokers today, offering advice on transactions involving dollars and U.S. dollar securities. This move implies that with the war debt issue now resolved, the pound exchange rate is expected to stabilize soon. (Reuters, 15th)</h3>
<p>Lao Yongyi = Consultations on a Currency Truce = London's Finance Minister, Georges Bonnet, stated that France, Britain, and the U.S. have agreed to temporarily stabilize the exchange rates of the franc, pound, and dollar during the conference, in order to discuss permanent stabilization measures. The details are expected to be released around Saturday or Monday. The agreement is not yet fully finalized, but there is sufficient consensus to ensure that exchange rates will not fluctuate wildly during the conference. Once fully agreed, the three countries will invite all participating nations to join, establishing a kind of currency truce. However, this final plan may not specify a fixed exchange rate, but rather aim to maintain the current parity, while allowing for flexibility to enable countries to prevent speculation. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>English Newspaper Report = Woodin's Denial = Following Washington Finance Minister Georges Bonnet's announcement that France, Britain, and the U.S. had agreed to stabilize the exchange rates of the three countries during the conference, the London Daily Mail published this news, also stating that the U.S. President had consulted with New York banker Harrison by phone and had approved the stabilization plan. It was also said that the three countries had agreed to set the exchange rate of the British pound against the U.S. dollar at $4.05, but with a fluctuation range of up to ten cents. This news, upon reaching the U.S., immediately caused a commotion. The U.S. President immediately instructed his secretary to declare that he had not spoken with Harrison by phone and had not approved the plan reported in the English newspapers. U.S. Treasury Secretary Woodin also issued a statement immediately, denying that the U.S. delegation had agreed to any stabilization plan, stating that the consultations in London were merely exploratory in nature. After the U.S. President denied the English newspaper report, the U.S. financial community became even more confused, as many U.S. bankers favored a truce on both currency and tariffs. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Hull Expresses = Optimism about the Conference = London U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull told a Reuters reporter tonight that he is now more optimistic about the real progress of the World Economic Conference than he was yesterday. The serious approach taken at the beginning of the conference indicates that it will continue to be serious throughout. The delegations of the major countries have expressed a remarkably consistent agreement on the main causes of the world's chronic ills and their fundamental cures. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Five Wheat Nations = Discuss Production Limits = London The five most important wheat-exporting countries, namely Argentina, Canada, Australia, Soviet Russia, and the United States, will form a committee tomorrow. The discussions will likely focus on the issue of reducing planting. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London The wheat conference of Canada, Argentina, the United States, and Australia has encountered divergent opinions. Canada and the United States, due to their large wheat surpluses, advocate limiting wheat planting, while Argentina and Australia, lacking stockpiles, object. It has now been decided to establish two subcommittees to discuss the matter separately. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Debt Negotiations = Germany Gets Its Wish = London Reliable sources in Germany say that an agreement may be reached today in London between Germany and its creditor nations. According to the announcement last week by Schacht, the president of the German Reichsbank, Germany has requested that representatives of creditor nations and the Bank for International Settlements meet in London on June 13 regarding long-term loans. The creditor nations have agreed, and important discussions have been taking place there over the past two or three days. Germany announced that from June 8, all debts borrowed by Germany before July 1931 would be suspended, due to Germany's current financial position, which was caused by the recent banking crisis. According to this announcement, the payment of principal and interest on the Dawes and Young loans will be suspended. It is reported that as a result of discussions this week, the creditor nations have made some concessions to Germany regarding interest rates. The average commission rate will be reduced from 4.75% to 4.25%. The creditor nations have also agreed to temporarily refrain from exercising their right to demand repayment of principal.

<p>Obtaining Economic Aid = Austrian Chancellor Gladly Returns Home = London Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, currently in London attending the World Economic Conference, is scheduled to take a plane back to Austria via Paris tomorrow. While in Paris, he will meet with French Foreign Minister Georges-Henri Bonnet, and then bring back to Austria the good news that France, Italy, and Britain have agreed to issue the loan of 8.5 million British pounds promised to Austria in Lausanne. It is reported that the loan will enable Austria to convert its short-term loans into long-term loans, greatly improving the country's financial situation. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Austria Vigorously Suppresses Hitler Movement - Over a Thousand National Socialists Arrested</p>
<p>National Telegram, Vienna, 15th Within the last few days, the number of National Socialists arrested in Austria has not fallen below one thousand one hundred and forty-two individuals, including three hundred and eighty-six civil servants, eighty-one department heads, and twenty-one military officers. Those arrested in the various provinces are not included in this figure. It is reported that the arrestees will soon be tried by the courts on charges ranging from serious charges of conspiracy to minor charges of misconduct.</p>
<p>National Telegram, Vienna, 16th Demonstrations continue throughout the country, demanding the release of the arrested National Socialists. The government now receives thousands of petitions daily.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 15th Earlier reports that former German Chancellor and Defense Minister General Kurt von Schleicher had been imprisoned in a German fortress were denied by German authorities. However, news received by Le Matin from Geneva claims that Schleicher was indeed imprisoned, but has now escaped from German territory and fled to Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 15th The Italian semi-official media outlet "Giornale d'Italia" published an article commenting on German-Austrian relations. Its wording appears to favor the Dollfuss government in Austria, stating, "No country should voluntarily relinquish its right to self-determination. Therefore, Austria's efforts to protect its autonomy are perfectly reasonable, and this is something Berlin should not forget." This is the first time an Italian newspaper has expressed such sentiments.</p>
<p>Tass, Paris, 15th The French newspaper L'Intransigeant claims that White Russians residing in France and Germany maintain close ties with the German National Socialists. The "L'Europe Nouvelle" weekly magazine points out that a White Russian Stormtrooper detachment has been formed in Berlin. "L'Europe Nouvelle" uses documentary evidence to show that White Russians in Paris not only openly sympathize with German fascism in newspapers, but also that White Russian leaders in Paris maintain organizational ties with the National Socialists. The newspaper also describes a recent joint meeting between National Socialists and White Russians in Berlin, where a Saint George's flag from the Tsarist era was hung on the balcony, followed by the Romanov dynasty's coat of arms, and one of the speakers was a White Russian.</p>

<p>U.S.-Japan Naval Arms Race: U.S. to Build 32 New Ships in Three Years; Japan to Launch Second Naval Expansion Next Year; Soviet Russia Deploys Along the Amur River</p>
<p>Washington U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral William H. Standley, announced today that the United States will immediately begin constructing new ships. It is projected that thirty-two new ships will be completed in three years. Several of these will begin construction in naval shipyards in January, and others will follow successively in private shipyards. The total cost is estimated at $238,000,000, to be allocated from the government's proposed public works budget, as this shipbuilding project is part of the public works program. The first ships to be built will include four 10,000-ton cruisers, armed with six-inch guns as stipulated by the London Treaty. In addition, twenty destroyers, two 20,000-ton aircraft carriers, four submarines, and two gunboats will also be built in succession. All designs have been completed and submitted to naval shipyards, and those to be built in private shipyards have been reviewed by various companies, with bidding to begin next month. It is reported that two of the gunboats, once completed, will be stationed in China to protect overseas Chinese. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo The Naval General Staff is studying the fundamental principles for compiling the next fiscal year's budget. They have established a foundation based on the Second Naval Replenishment Plan, adhering to the London Naval Treaty. They have decided to request the necessary funding. The Navy Department is closely monitoring the effects of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, which will occur two years from now, and the expansion of the U.S. Navy in light of the 1935 disarmament conference. President Roosevelt approved the naval replenishment plan on the 14th. Therefore, the balance of naval power between Japan and the U.S. after 1936 is unfavorable to Japan. This matter has a significant impact on Japan's national defense. Consequently, it is necessary to implement the Second Replenishment Plan beginning next year. The specific details are currently being prepared by the Naval General Staff. It is reported that the plan involves a three-year project to build a surge of warships and establish air groups, with a budget of approximately 470 million yen.</p>
<p>Tokyo The Navy Department, citing the effect of the notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations, the re-emergence of the South Seas Mandate issue, the 1935 disarmament conference, U.S. naval expansion, and the overall urgency of the international situation, has decided to implement the Second Replenishment Plan starting in fiscal year Showa 9 (1934), aiming to complete it by Showa 11 (1936) at the latest. Part of the budget has already been accounted for in the fiscal year Showa 8 (1933) budget. Apart from one 10,000-ton submarine tender and two submarine chasers, the general outline is not significantly different from the Showa 8 plan, with a total cost of 500 million yen. This includes the construction costs for one aircraft carrier, two light cruisers, seven destroyers, six submarines, one minelayer, and several minesweepers and torpedo boats, as well as the costs for establishing five air groups. This is a continuing project over three to four years. An additional 50 to 60 million yen will be requested for the next fiscal year. Therefore, the next fiscal year's navy budget will include the Showa 8 arms improvement expenses and the Showa 9 natural increase of 5.78 million yen, inevitably exceeding the Showa 8 request.

<p>Harbin According to reliable sources here today, Soviet Russia is currently constructing defense works on the right bank of the Amur River, engaging in intense activity.

<p>Expanding Diplomatic Network, Seeking Collusion in All Directions</p>
<p>Further Consideration of Cultural Liaison with Various Countries</p>
<p>Tokyo Foreign Minister Uchida addressed the Cabinet Council today, forcefully advocating the following new expanded diplomatic policies: (1) The post-League of Nations diplomatic policy should maintain international friendly relations through multilateral diplomacy.

(4) To achieve the goal of economic diplomacy, consulates and legations should be established in Egypt, Turkey, other Far Eastern countries, India, the South Seas islands, and "Manchukuo," and commercial officials should be increased. (Nichi-Ren Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo On June 14, the League of Nations Secretariat sent a notification regarding the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" to its member states. The Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the following statement yesterday: The League of Nations, as a non-supranational organization, is exceeding its authority by sending documents regarding a nation's decision on whether or not to grant recognition. Accepting this is an act of sovereign suicide. "Manchukuo" will pursue political and economic development regardless of the League of Nations' non-recognition resolution. Furthermore, the United States and France have concluded trade relations through private organizations. (Dentsu, 16th)</p>

The puppet central government renamed Yudu to Bosheng County. Salt and rice are extremely scarce in the bandit areas, with only a small amount smuggled in from Maodian, Tingzhou, Baijia, and other places, like a drop in the bucket. The Zhen Dianfang unit of the puppet 10th Army of the Eastern Jiangxi Military Region has recovered its old nests of Ge Yuan and Zhoufang after being surrounded by the Zhang Hua and Liang Xing units.

<p>The "Hua Wu" Steamer Caught Fire and Was Extinguished by Fireboats, Resulting in Losses of Approximately Two to Three Thousand Yuan. The Guowen News Agency reports that the "Hua Wu," managed by the Nanhua Steamboat Company at 60 Ningbo Road in this port, caught fire yesterday morning at the Songkou port. Fireboats rushed to extinguish the flames, and no one was injured. The losses are estimated to be only a few thousand yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Nanhua Steamboat Company, managed by Fei, only has one commercial vessel, the "Hua Wu." It has no fixed schedule and is a wildcat steamer. It is 360 feet long and has a deadweight of 2,769 tons. The shipowner is a Norwegian named Kongzhen (A. Kuntsen), and it has a crew of over thirty. There are no passengers. It was insured for 100,000 yuan with companies such as Lianbang Zhaoye for maritime risks. This time, it was carrying timber from Manila to Shanghai. Two incidents of fire have occurred. After the ship arrived at Songkou, a portion of the coal in the lower hold suddenly caught fire the day before yesterday evening. The crew managed to extinguish it. However, at ten o'clock yesterday afternoon, the lower hold on the starboard side caught fire again. Active efforts were made to extinguish it, but the fire was more intense than the first time, and the cargo consisted entirely of flammable timber. Smoke and flames filled the river for a time, making it impossible to extinguish. The coastal radio station sent a message to Shanghai for help. Losses were not significant. The reporter inquired with the company and learned that the fire in the coal bunker was caused by the ship tilting during its voyage. The coal loaded on the starboard side of the lower hold was close to the boiler, causing it to ignite due to the heat. Upon receiving the telegram, the company dispatched the Puji fireboat to provide assistance. Since the fire was in the lower hold, firefighters had to break open the ship's compartments before using breathing apparatus to enter and extinguish the flames, finally putting it out by 11:30. The ship was then towed into Donggou between the 41st and 42nd buoys. The company had also sent laborers on a boat to remove the coal and repair the compartments. Only the compartments and a small portion of the cargo were damaged, so the losses were limited, with repairs estimated at two to three thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Impersonating an Official to Defraud Money: Wang Yimin Poses as a Fake Danyang County Magistrate; Lai Binhui Loses Money and Employment</h3>
<p>It is pitiful that Wang Yimin, a native of Shaoxing, had no way to make a living after graduating from Shanghai Chizhi University. He lived idly in Hangzhou. Later, he was introduced to Lai Binhui and Chen Zhichuan, employees of the Maoheng Timber Firm on Yingzi Road in Hangzhou, by his friend Fan Binzhang. Over time, they became close friends. Wang, considering Lai and others as mere merchants with limited vision, often boasted, claiming he had previously served as the warden of Qingtian County Prison. After resigning from that position, he planned to seek other opportunities. Lai and others deeply believed him, treating him almost like a deity. In January of this year, Wang had another idea. He told Lai and others that the Nanjing Examination Yuan would soon begin examinations for county magistrates. Unwilling to give up on himself, he decided to go to the capital to take the exam. Lai and others encouraged him. Wang seized the opportunity to borrow travel expenses, promising that if he obtained an official position, he would never forget them. Lai readily agreed to help him fulfill his ambitions, providing over 150 yuan to cover his expenses. After obtaining the funds, Wang left Hangzhou. It is unknown where he stayed for a long time, but after his money ran out, he returned to Hangzhou and met with Lai. He told him that he had taken the examination in the capital and was among the top candidates. He had been appointed as the magistrate of Danyang County and would soon take office. He spoke with a joyful expression, as if it were true. Lai did not suspect any deception and tried his best to assist Wang, even volunteering his services. Wang repeatedly nodded in agreement. On April 6th, Wang gave Lai a letter of appointment, appointing him as the head of receiving and dispatching. Lai was overjoyed, believing he was ascending to a high position, and resigned from his job. He remained at Wang's side day and night, and Wang's expenses were temporarily covered by Lai. They traveled from Hangzhou to Shanghai and stayed at the Yongbao Hotel at 364 Hankou Road. Wang stayed in room 17, and Lai stayed in room 15. Over two months passed. Lai often inquired about the date of taking office, but Wang always gave vague answers. Recently, Lai began to suspect something was wrong, but he did not dare to make a final decision. He secretly telegraphed the Danyang County government, inquiring whether there had been a change of county magistrate and whether the new magistrate was someone named Wang. He received a reply from the county, confirming that Wang's claims were a complete fabrication. Lai was utterly despondent. Reflecting on the past, he realized he had abandoned his job, lost money, and felt deeply resentful. Angered that Wang had betrayed their friendship, he reported him to the General Patrol Station. Detective Zhu Ziqing was dispatched to arrest Wang. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Qian Hongye conducted the preliminary hearing. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested that the defendant be punished according to Articles 166 and 224 of the Criminal Code. It has been reported that Wang Yimin has impersonated officials to defraud money on more than one occasion. In addition to Lai Binhui, there are others who suffered losses after hoping to marry into wealth. The patrol station needs to conduct a detailed investigation. Judge Qian ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and set a deadline for further investigation and trial.</p>
<h3>Case of a Robbery of Over Ten Thousand Yuan: Those Who Came with the Victim Collude to Steal in Old Yong'an Street</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday, a major robbery of over ten thousand yuan occurred near the entrance of Yong'an Lane in the French Concession. The patrol station is currently conducting a thorough investigation. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhao Zhangyun's Character: Zhao Zhangyun, a native of Yongjia, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, is over forty years old. He has worked as a steward on the Guangji steamer, which travels between Wenzhou and Shanghai for the China Merchants Bureau. Zhao is known for his sincerity and is trusted by passengers. He was also hired by the Qianji Hotel at 285 Huajin Lane as a ship attendant to attract customers. He has been traveling between Wenzhou and Shanghai for over ten years.</p>
<p>The silver and money industry trusts Zhao. Zhao has a long history of serving on the Guangji steamer. He often carries funds from banks and financial institutions in Wenzhou to Shanghai and has a good reputation. Banks and financial circles in both Wenzhou and Shanghai trust him. The Guangji steamer travels from Wenzhou to Shanghai every Thursday and returns from Shanghai to Wenzhou every week. Zhao carries around ten thousand yuan each time, earning hundreds of yuan in handling fees.</p>
<p>Money and Bills in Leather Bags on a Cart: This time, the steamer arrived from Wenzhou, originally scheduled to arrive the day before yesterday afternoon. However, due to heavy fog, it was delayed until 3:00 AM yesterday. Zhao met Hu Jiqing, a client from Wenzhou, on the ship. After the ship docked, Zhao hired a rickshaw to take Hu Jiqing to the Qianji Hotel. After Hu left, Zhao, along with Hu's two pieces of luggage, hired another cart to carry the cash he had brought from several financial institutions in Wenzhou, including Houkang Dingtai and Meixiang Foreign Goods, totaling 128,000 yuan in bills, packed in a large leather bag. Five men dressed in short clothes followed behind the cart, and Zhao followed behind the cart, heading north along the Bund, intending to first deliver it to the Qianji Hotel and then transfer it to several financial institutions in the city, including Futai on Beijing Road, Yichang on Nanshi, Tongyi Trust Company on Beijing Road, Commercial Savings Branch Bank on Jishui Street, and Kangda Shenzhuang on Nanshi.</p>
<p>As the cart and people were walking along the Bund, five men in short clothes followed behind Zhao. Zhao initially thought they were passengers or pedestrians from the dock, so he was not prepared for anything unexpected. When they reached the Taikoo Foreign Goods Company in the north of Xinkai River, four of the five men pointed guns and stopped Zhao and the cart from moving forward, ordering them to turn west into Old Yong'an Street. Zhao and the cart driver, seeing that the robbers were fierce, dared not resist and complied. At the entrance of Yong'an Lane in Old Yong'an Street, in a flash of disappearance, one of the robbers empty-handed, went forward to rob the leather bag on the cart which stored the banknotes, and the bandits holding guns guarded behind, in a flash and immediately disappeared and left no trace. Zhao, together with the cart driver, went to the Da Zi Zhu Zhong Mailan Patrol Station to report the robbery, requesting an investigation. The patrol station received the report and immediately sent detectives to investigate the robbery. The patrol station also notified all Chinese and Western detectives on duty to strictly investigate the case and bring the robbers to justice.</p>
<h3>Manager of Jin Xinhua Silk Weaving Factory Commits Suicide by Taking Poison; Wang Yukun Embezzles Funds and, in Desperation, Unable to Repay, Resortes to This Last Resort</h3>
<p>Wang Yukun, the 52-year-old Hangzhou native manager of Jin Xinhua Silk Weaving Factory located at 23 Longren Lane, Pingliang Road, recently, a certain rice shop paid the factory an account of 400 yuan, which was given to Wang for registration and cancellation. Wang temporarily misappropriated the money for some urgent use without recording it. Yesterday, the factory owner checked the accounts and discovered that the money from a certain rice shop had not been paid for a long time, so he sent someone else to collect it. After checking together, they learned about the previous situation. The factory then turned to Wang to demand repayment, but Wang had no savings and was unable to come up with a large sum of money. Yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, in desperation, Wang secretly ingested a large amount of opium and committed suicide. Around 9:00 AM, the factory staff discovered him and rushed Wang to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the poisoning was too severe, and nothing could be done. He died at 12:00 PM. The hospital reported the incident to the Hongkou Patrol Station, which transferred the body to the coroner's office for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>The Public and Private Lawsuits of the New Renhe Steamer Disaster Have Concluded Their Arguments; Sentencing Set for 22nd Afternoon</h3>
<p>The New Renhe steamer disaster continued its debate yesterday morning at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Judge: Guo Xihou, according to the investigation file, Wang Sanlang, who lost items, was identified by you. Have you seen this person and do you recognize him?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not seen him.</p>
<p>Judge: How do you know it was Wang Sanlang?</p>
<p>Answer: I heard it from the passengers.</p>
<p>Judge: What was the passenger's name?</p>
<p>Answer: I don't know. But I saw Wang's wife.</p>
<p>Judge: Where did he board the ship?</p>
<p>Answer: He boarded the ship from Chongming Haihong Port.</p>
<p>Judge: How long does it take to travel from Haimen to Chongming?</p>
<p>Answer: Six or seven hours. Our ship goes through Chongming, Haimen, and Qidong. The ship arrives in Qidong at 10:00 AM. Returning, we arrive on the 18th at 6:00 PM. Wang Sanlang got off at Chongming.</p>
<p>Judge: How many docks are there from Qidong to Haimen?</p>
<p>Answer: More than ten docks.</p>
<p>Judge: When did the fight break out?</p>
<p>Answer: The fight broke out when the passengers disembarked, because they were dissatisfied. Later, Wang Sanlang robbed the money and did not disembark. Wang Sanlang said that he was robbed of money and had his front teeth knocked out.</p>
<p>Judge: Since you heard Wang Sanlang say this, how can you say you haven't seen the person?</p>
<p>Answer: I heard it from Chen Baosheng.</p>
<p>Judge: Don't push everything onto Chen Baosheng, who is not part of the case. Just answer whether you saw the person or not.</p>
<p>Guo: I don't.</p>
<p>Judge: Sun Xingsheng, testify. Guo Xihou is completely confused and has no brains. I saw Wang Sanlang after the fact. The truth is that on the 17th, Wang Sanlang and his wife traveled from Shanghai to Chongming and disembarked at Haihong Port. They were robbed by pirates of over twenty yuan. Later, because the money was robbed, they couldn't proceed. The husband and wife started crying. Later, they found a petty thief who didn't return the money and instead injured Wang and his wife. Wang Sanlang did not disembark. Later, a military officer resolved the matter and said that a few yuan had been returned. So, there was a fight once at 10:00 PM. I don't know if they disembarked later. Wang Sanlang did not walk until the ship returned to Haihong Port at 6:00 or 7:00 PM on the second day, when Wang Sanlang and his wife finally disembarked. However, at 7:00 or 8:00 PM, another robbery occurred on the ship outside of Wusong Port. As a result, the passengers became angry and fought as a group. At that time, the pirates were unable to resist and jumped into the sea.</p>
<p>Public Prosecutor's Argument: At this point, the judge instructed the lawyers to present their arguments. Lawyer Xu Heling started by saying that this was a temporary act of righteous indignation, and there is solid evidence to prove it. The defendant, Lu Shuigeng, only signed the contract for incitement to murder, which was just to increase wages. Murder only brings misfortune, not fortune. Therefore, the contract was merely to increase wages. Liu Tingsheng and Lu Yaozu were stewards, and Liu Yongqing was a fireman. How could they have the skills to participate in murder? Furthermore, some of them did not sign the contract for increased wages, and there is no proof. Therefore, a not-guilty verdict should be rendered.</p>
<p>Next, Lawyer Zhang Shibeng defended Wang Moqing, stating that the prosecutor amended the charge to Article 284 but did not explain the premeditation of murder or the circumstances of the harm. The prosecutor's argument that the meeting constituted premeditation is also without basis. Even Ye Yuanfu's confession does not implicate the defendant, Wang Moqing. "Sharing fortune and hardship" implies that murder only brings misfortune, not fortune. This is mere speculation and not a planned murder.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Tongqing added that Wang Moqing did not have the opportunity to participate during his work. As for Liu Maoda, he returned from Changzhou on the 19th, and the incident in Shanghai occurred on the 18th. The timing does not match.</p>
<p>Next, Lawyer Liu Shiqi defended the defendants Gao Jixing, Gao Jiyu, and Shi Fangguo, saying that most of the defendants testified that they were subjected to waterboarding by the water patrol team. This should be given special attention. According to Article 280 of the Criminal Procedure Law, forced confessions cannot be considered valid. Whether the water patrol team's confession can be adopted is within the prosecutor's authority. However, Detective Yang Chunting testified that he was not present during the interrogation, and the deputy captain of the water patrol team, Ren Runsheng, testified that their water patrol team is not an investigative team. The fact that the administrative agency obtained the confession is obvious and cannot be adopted. Regarding Feng Xingfa, the prosecutor charged him with carrying out the murder, but there must be a cause. The public recognizes, and the prosecutor acknowledges, that the crime was theft and piracy. Article 36 of the Criminal Code states that defending oneself and eliminating evil for society should not be punished by the state but should be rewarded. This type of person is harmful to society, so this should be considered. The evidence against Feng Xingfa is also untrue, so a not-guilty verdict should be declared. Gao Jiyu is already over fifty years old, an old man. How could he fight with experienced thieves and pirates? The prosecutor's charge of conspiracy to commit murder must have a plan and indication to form a principle. He is a laborer, working hard and going to bed early. The facts show that he was not involved. The arguments for defending Gao Jixing and Shi Fangguo are the same.</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Shou'an added that they are laborers working in the lowest cargo hold, so their position and time make it impossible for them to participate. Gao Jixing's signature was代扦by Gao Jiyu代扦, which both sides admitted. However, Gao Jiyu signed for increased wages, otherwise, how could murder bring fortune? Shi Fangguo was at home due to illness, as proven by Cao Changgen's presence in court, so he is even more innocent.</p>
<p>Lastly, Lawyer Shi Qinghua defended Shen Chuanlang, Wang Mingda, Liu Yongqing, Wang Xingjiang, etc., stating, "I must first report my position as the defense lawyer. After these twenty-three people were arrested, I, along with Lawyers Cai Nipei and Lu Jianai, because we were all executive committee members of the same hometown association, their families cried and pleaded. So, we are handling this case pro bono, spending three days reviewing the files and four days appearing in court, with the sole aim of ensuring that the guilty are punished and the innocent are spared injustice. The defendants all claim that the victims jumped into the sea and died because they had nowhere to escape and fell into the sea. But this jumping into the sea to die should have been witnessed by many people, yet no passengers have come forward to testify. This is strange. The families of the victims all say that Ma Kou and others were said to have thrown them into the sea, but no one witnessed it either. This is also strange. Because of these two strange circumstances, we must investigate whether the bodies have been found and whether they were petty thieves or pirates. The prosecutor considers them petty thieves, but everyone unanimously calls them pirates. So, the crime before the attack was fighting. This was an act of violence, and there was no leader. Even if there is a confession, it must be confirmed by the body. As for the witnesses among Gu Ji'an and the other twenty-three people who testified against them, they reported the crime to the water patrol team, which is of course unfavorable to the defendants. Therefore, there is room for consideration in the judgment. However, the testimony is very weak. Checking their past confessions, they said that one person fell into the river, and the others said they were tied up, but they never said that four people were thrown into the river. Therefore, the evidence is lacking. The defendants' level of knowledge is also pitiful. It is already noon."</p>
<p>In the afternoon, at 2:00 PM, Lawyer Shi continued, "Regarding Shen Chuanlang's crime, the charge of incitement should first be established. Furthermore, the indictment of Shen being incited should state how he was incited, how he carried it out, and how he premeditated it. All of this is missing. Criminal law punishes with a subjective perspective and also reforms evil nature. Assuming there is guilt, the circumstances of the crime can be specially reduced or mitigated according to Articles 76 and 77 of the Criminal Law. As for Wang Mingda, since his arrest, the suspicion against him is that Gu Ji'an identified him as the one who moved the stone. But can a child of ten years old move a giant stone of one or two square feet? Does he have the strength to do so? It cannot be determined. Furthermore, it has not been proven that this stone was the one tied to the person's body, directly causing harm to the person. If he is guilty, the reasons are the same as above and need not be repeated. Wang Mingda's family has no place to stand, and his father sings small tunes in a teahouse. The issue of his knowledge is pitiful. The conclusion for these two people is that the results of the interrogation involve key points of the entire case. Wang Moqing cannot reveal the truth. The letters between Zhang Tongqing and Sun Xingsheng, which were presented yesterday, show that both of them are illiterate. They must have been written by a fellow prisoner. But please ask someone outside the case to write a letter on behalf of someone's intention. Therefore, please investigate the origin of the note in detail to avoid injustice. Wang Mingda, Shen Chuanlang, etc., did not sign, so they were unaware of the decision at that time. As for Wang Xingjiang, no one has accused him of anything since he was at the water patrol team. It can be seen that there was no behavior involved. Please render a verdict of not guilty."</p>
<p>At this point, Lawyers Lu Jianai and Cai Nipei presented letters from the hometown association with the association's seal, proving that the victims had been robbed and beaten on the ship that day, and defended Shen Xingqiao, Huang Fusheng, Zhang Xiaozhang, etc., saying that there was no evidence against them, and requested that Wang Sanlang be identified as the key to this case. The lawyers have all separately and jointly defended each of the defendants. The judge then asked Huang Fusheng if he had any opinions. Huang replied that he was a sailor. When Wang Sanlang was robbed of over twenty yuan, Wang shouted for help. The passengers heard about the piracy, Wang refused to disembark, wanting to report to the shipowner, but there were five or six thieves behind him. I asked them, and they cursed me, stabbed my hands and legs three times with a knife. I was treated in the hospital and can prove it. These pirates were tied up by the passengers. But I heard about it and didn't see it because I was injured. I was originally going to send them to the Public Security Bureau to be dealt with, but later I was gone.</p>
<p>Judge: Why didn't you send them to Qidong County?</p>
<p>Answer: I didn't dare to send them, I was afraid of their gang. What I'm saying now is the truth.</p>
<p>At this point, Huang Fusheng's testimony further clarified the situation of the case. The judge again asked the defendants if they had any opinions. They all claimed innocence. The judge then announced the conclusion of the public argument and the start of the private argument.</p>
<p>Private argument: Lawyer Zhu Shaowen, representing Yu Jiaqing and Ma Chenshi, stated that the New Renhe steamer from Shanghai to Qidong was loading cargo and passengers, and it should have stopped at one place for a certain amount of time. However, it turned back without stopping, which can be inferred as intentional harm, so they were willing to sacrifice. The passengers opened it back, so the public prosecution was very clear. The private plaintiffs requested a total of 30,000 yuan. The defendant who caused the harm should of course be responsible, and Yuxing Company's illegal encroachment was completely in the execution of public affairs. Wang Guanxian is the deputy manager of the company, that is, the legal representative of the company. Of course, the company and the ship acted together. According to Article 188 of the Civil Code, they requested a joint and several compensation. They also requested 19,800 yuan on behalf of Wei Songshi and 16,200 yuan on behalf of Sun Zhoushi. The reasons for their claims were the same as before.</p>
<p>At this point, Lawyer Li Jin, on behalf of Ma Chenshi, requested and supplemented Lawyer Zhu's statement, in accordance with Article 188 of the Civil Code, Article 23 of the Maritime Law, and Article 33 of the Company Law, stipulating that Gu is the manager of the company, Wang Guanxian is the assistant, Sun Xingsheng is the shipowner, and Guo Xihou is the comprador, all of whom are not executing their duties. The family members of the victims all said that the conflict arose from checking tickets, wasn't that a kind of execution of duties? Commercial steamers do not stop at the dock but are also sailing, that is, in the execution of their duties, which is of course in accordance with the law. Please still order the company to provide joint and several compensation, etc.</p>
<p>At this point, Lawyer Tang Hao, on behalf of Mei Youshi, requested 15,356 yuan and requested a judgment with the criminal case. This case is based on Article 506 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 188 of the Civil Code, Article 23 of the Maritime Law, and Article 33 of the Company Law. The necessary condition is the execution of duties. Were the defendants harming five people? Which one was performing a duty? The captain, the pilot, the steward, selling tickets, collecting tickets, lighting the fire, and cleaning were all executing duties. Moreover, Article 108 of the Maritime Law requires the passengers to be sent to their destination, and Article 103 of the Company Law also requires the company to be responsible for transporting the passengers to their destination. This shows that what place did these five people transport to? The ship of course has to bear a kind of guarantee responsibility, even if the passengers were harmed by the passengers, it should also bear joint and several liability. He said that one person fell into the Linggang Port and was rescued by a 洋划子(small foreign boat) then where did this body go? The ship and the company are of course jointly and severally liable. It was also said that Wang Guanxian was a nominal assistant, which has not been announced. As long as he is an assistant, he should bear joint and several liability. He also used a letter from the public association to prove that Mei Laoer was indeed a peddler, etc. Lawyers Yue Qing, Yu Xiangqin, etc., requested 15,000 yuan on behalf of Zhou Mashi. Their intentions were the same as Lawyer Tang's.</p>
<p>The agent lawyer of Yuxing Company, Guo Shouyi, claimed that in this case, the plaintiff in the incidental civil lawsuit raised an incidental civil lawsuit. According to Article 506 of the Criminal Procedure Law, only against the defendant and the person liable for compensation according to the Civil Law can it be raised. Yuxing Company is not a criminal defendant. Even if the company should bear joint and several liability according to the Civil Law, Article 188 of the Civil Law, Article 23, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Maritime Law, both refer to the employee infringing on the rights of a third person while performing his duties. The defendants in this case are suspected of murder. Even if it is true, it is entirely a personal act and does not comply with the provisions of the Civil Law and the Maritime Law. The company does not bear the slightest responsibility. If it is said according to Lawyer Tang, not selling tickets means performing duties, but the duty of checking tickets does not necessarily require killing people. It was also said that everyone on the ship was performing duties, then eating and defecating were also performing duties. As for saying that they had to be sent to their destination, they were killed halfway, so they could not be sent. What does this have to do with the company? Wang Guanxian's nominal assistant, whether announced or not, to know the scope of the assistant's execution, is within the company. There is no position for an assistant on the ship. Killing is also an individual act and has nothing to do with the company. But he boarded the ship without buying a ticket. Article 33 of the Company Law refers to shareholders or managers damaging other people's rights while performing their duties. It is even more inappropriate to cite the Company Law to request compensation. Also, in terms of the amount claimed, it is also a casual claim. The first claim was a total of 47,880 yuan, and then separate claims were made, totaling 106,956 yuan. It can be seen that there is no standard at all. Moreover, the assessment of compensation must consider the identity of the victim and the financial resources of the defendant to make a decision. The victim's military status is said to be a petty thief, that is, not engaged in a proper business. Even if he dies, it has no effect on the family's life and there is no question of compensation. A petty thief may have run into a diamond, which they cannot finish eating in their lifetime, or two or three gangs cannot get food. How can there be a standard? Even if the claimants say they are peddlers, their income is limited. How can they raise their value immediately after the victim dies and seek compensation of more than 100,000 yuan? The company only has this New Renhe ship, and its current net assets exceed its positive assets, so the company has no financial resources at all. However, this is only to point out the errors in the amount claimed by the claimants. The company does not bear any civil responsibility at all. Even if the claimants request one yuan, it is legally unfounded. The request to reject the company's request.</p>
<p>At this point, the judge declared the end of the private argument. This case will be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. The defendants were separately remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>The Patrol Station Adds to Zhao Ruquan's Case; Continues the Trial; Another Charge of Breach of Trust</h3>
<p>A secret conversation is unrelated. Jiang Wanping reviews the accounts. Zhao Ruquan, an actor who is a shareholder and manager of the Samsung Stage, was recently reported by Zhou Bingchen, the former manager of the stage, to have found evidence of fraud. The report was made to the Lao Zha Patrol Station, which obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special District Court. The case was brought by Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Western Captain Huito and submitted to the First Special Court for a second trial. The patrol station found concrete evidence of embezzlement of advertising fees of 1,170 yuan and interest from the electricity company of 370 yuan and 62.2 cents, and the case has been prosecuted. The court ordered Zhao to post bail. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was held. At 2:30 PM, Criminal Judge Feng Shide interrogated him in the First Criminal Court. Patrol Station Lawyer Ru Shiyi, Zhou Bingchen's representative lawyers Chen Tingrui, Yuan Yang'an, and Du Jimei, Zhao Ruquan, and defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Xue Dubi were all present.</p>
<p>First, Patrol Station Lawyer Ru claimed that in addition to the two cases already prosecuted by the patrol station, accountants Zhao Zuwei and Xi Yushu reviewed the accounts and concluded that Zhao Ruquan had committed more offenses. The total amount of the two prosecuted offenses was 61,303.88 yuan. The details of each offense are as follows:</p>
<p>⑴ Embezzlement of cash of 26,475.9 yuan: After offsetting the receipts and payments of the Samsung Stage, the cash that should have been deposited was 61,539.9 yuan. After deducting the 35,064 yuan in the Siming Bank passbook presented by Zhao, there was still a shortage of 26,475.9 yuan. The whereabouts of this amount are unknown, and it was actually embezzled by Zhao.</p>
<p>⑵ Inflated management expenses, totaling 3,890 yuan: The accounts show a monthly salary of 100 yuan for the manager and a monthly salary of 160 yuan for the supervisor. However, management and supervision are actually the same position, but two different titles were used, causing the Samsung Stage to lose the above amount. According to the patrol station's investigation, both the manager and the supervisor were Zhao Ruquan's sons.</p>
<p>⑶ Embezzlement of net profit from 1931 to 1922, totaling 26,927.55 yuan: The method of embezzling the net profit was to list revenue-generating and other items that should not be listed as expenses as expenses.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the patrol station amended the charges, accusing Zhao of committing the crimes of breach of trust and embezzlement under Articles 357 and 366 of the Criminal Code. In addition, patrol station personnel discovered that the defendant Zhao Ruquan and Tong Ziqing, the manager of the Grand Stage, were secretly talking to Xu Zhonglin, the manager of the Siming Bank, at the Siming Bank when they were investigating the accounts. The subject of their conversation could not be found out because it was inconvenient for the patrol station to interfere. The patrol station has summoned Tong and Xu today and asks the court to question them to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Judge Feng first questioned Zhao Ruquan about what he had discussed with Xu Zhonglin that day. According to Zhao, he had mortgaged his house to the Siming Bank for 10,000 yuan two years ago, and the mortgage was due yesterday. The bank sent a letter in advance, instructing him to redeem the mortgage. Because he had no money, he asked Tong Ziqing to go to the Siming Bank to negotiate whether it could be extended. Manager Xu agreed to extend it for another six months, and there was nothing else. Then Tong and Xu were summoned to the court, and their testimony was roughly the same as Zhao's.</p>
<p>Patrol Station Lawyer Ru then claimed that the patrol station had previously obtained a search warrant from the court. The Samsung Stage had submitted all relevant books and documents to the court. However, when the patrol station went to the stage, the accountant Huang Huiting handed over eleven account books and said that there were no other account books. However, the defendant's side suddenly presented a passbook and account books. This is contrary to the search warrant, and the patrol station has a lot of value to pay attention to. The court is asked to pay attention. Then Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Western Captain Zhuan Tuo testified about the situation at that time. Judge Feng then summoned the stage's accountant Huang Huiting to court. According to Huang, the patrol station only needed business books, and there was also a temporary record book, which was managed by another accountant. It was in the drawer at that time, so it could not be handed over.</p>
<p>Following this, Lawyer Ru and the defendant's Lawyer Jiang made mutual statements about the facts. Lawyer Jiang then requested permission for the accountant Jiang Wanping, extended by the defendant, to re-examine the accounts. The court granted permission. At this point, it was already dusk. Judge Feng then announced that the case would be rescheduled for a hearing at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Gang Leader Visits Jail; Detectives Ambush and Suddenly Arrest; Seven People Arrested at the Same Time as Gang Leader Chen Shenggang; Ransom Victim Zhu Haibo Dies of Shock</h3>
<p>During the first month of the lunar calendar this year, Zhu Haibo, a farmer from Quansheng Village, LianTang Town, Songjiang West Township, and Zhang Heqing, who farmed in HanJia Village, Fengjing Town, Songjiang Prefecture, and Qi Wangshi, an old woman from Sanhe Village near the town, were successively kidnapped by a group of bandits armed with box guns and rifles to the bandit ship which, after many transfers, arrived in Shanghai. Except for Zhang Heqing, who was hidden at 31 Meifang Lane, West Binlang Road in this port, Zhu Haibo Qi Wangshi were taken on an empty coffin ship to Xiatang Township, which is part of Wujin County. One of the gang leaders contacted the ransom in Shanghai. The plot was discovered by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Team. The Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession's Putuo Road Patrol Station rescued Zhang Heqing from 291 Binlang Road on April 2nd. They also went to Changzhou and found Zhu Haibo and Qi Wangshi in two empty coffin ships. The bandits Wang Shaonian, Chen Bangfa, Zhu Guangui, Chen Yushan, Chen Shengfan, Zhang Qianghua, and suspected criminals Liu Kaigui, Xia Yueping, Jiang KeBao, Yang Yushan, Zhang Shaoxiang, Wang Yuchang, Chen Zhaoshi, Wang Yushi, and other fourteen men and women were arrested. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Later, the gang leader Chen Shenggang was identified by the criminals and was not captured. The bureau removed the captured bandits and sent them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for legal action. Detective Team Leader Lu Ying ordered the team members to investigate the fugitive gang leader. Until the day before yesterday, Detective Pei Yunzhang learned that the fugitive gang leader Chen Shenggang would go to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters Prison to visit the arrested criminals on a certain day and make contact. He reported the current situation to Team Leader Lu, who sent Detective Squad Leaders Liu Shaoqing, Detective Yang Zhongjin, Yang Qing, Dong Wenrui, Xie Wanlin, Pan Huanzhang, Xu Debiao, Dai Hongzhang, Wu Yihe, etc., to Longhua Road to cautiously record the entrance of the road, all disguised and ambushed on both sides of the road. In the afternoon, they saw them visit the prisoners in the headquarters and then come out of the office. The members suddenly jumped out and arrested Gong Xia</p>

<p>Audio Control Methods by Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Modern radios generally have three controls. The one in the middle is for adjusting the wavelength, and the two on the left and right are the volume control and tone control. The volume control is specifically for adjusting the sound level (Volume), while the tone control is specifically for managing the pitch (Tone). There are clear differences between them. Adding a tone control to the radio can eliminate a type of high-pitched noise, resulting in a more harmonious and pleasant sound from the speaker.</p>
<p>Generally, there are two types of tone control methods for radios:</p>
<p>(1) Screen Circuit Tone Control Method: As shown in Figure C, a 0.01 mfd fixed capacitor and R, a 50,000-ohm variable resistor, are connected to the primary coil of the low-frequency transformer. When using, adjusting the resistance value can control the pitch.</p>
<p>(2) Grid Circuit Tone Control Method: By reconnecting the capacitor and resistor in the grid circuit, the pitch can also be controlled. However, the capacitance of C should be smaller (from 0.003 to 0.005 mfd), as shown by the dashed line in the figure.</p>
<p>Both of the above methods yield good results. If you want to make a variable resistor yourself, please refer to the last part of the 14th issue of this publication for the principle of tone control. It should also be mentioned that when the high resistance R is reduced, the resistance to the current decreases, so higher-frequency sounds all escape through the bypass capacitor C. Therefore, the sound emitted from the speaker can avoid harsh high-pitched tones.</p>
<p>Radio Isolation Devices by Ming</p>
<p>The purpose of radio shielding is to confine the magnetic field and electrostatic field surrounding coils or capacitors within their own boundaries, preventing them from interacting with other components and preventing external magnetic fields from affecting them. The only way to achieve this goal is to place components with magnetic fields in metal boxes.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of shielding is greatly related to the metal used. In high-frequency stages, the best metal shielding material should have very low resistance and be non-magnetic, such as copper or aluminum, as these materials have lower losses. The magnetic field enclosed within the shielding material can allow current to pass through it. Current flow often causes power loss, and shielding can also increase the resistance of the adjustment circuit, so the lower the resistance of the shielding material, the lower the power loss.</p>
<p>In low-frequency stages (such as the audio frequency range), copper and aluminum are not effective for shielding. Iron is most suitable because its magnetic properties make it highly effective for low-frequency shielding. The increase in resistance due to shielding is also unrelated to the position of the components inside the shielding material. In particular, the distance between the coil and the surrounding shielding material must be at least equal to its diameter. The position of capacitors can be more arbitrary because the power loss due to electrostatic fields is minimal and can be ignored. Therefore, it is possible to install capacitors on the shielding material.</p>
<p>To make shielding effective, it is best to connect the shielding material to ground or to a point of zero high-frequency potential. (Mistake) Each amplification stage or each group of components must be shielded separately. Do not use a single piece of metal as a common shielding material for two stages (as shown in the figure). This will not only completely eliminate the effectiveness of the shielding but also cause cross-linking between the two stages (correct).</p>
<p>There are usually two types of shielding methods: one is to combine many components into an amplification stage and place them in a single shielding material; the other is to shield each component individually and then connect them with shielded wires. Shielding of non-adjustable high-frequency amplification stages in radios is not very important. Only the radio box needs to be metal to prevent coils and wiring from directly receiving signals.</p>
<p>Pentode Regenerative Single-Tube Radio by Zheng Geyu</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a trend in radio design to minimize the number of vacuum tubes, economize on power consumption, and strive for high efficiency, resulting in the successive introduction of high-gain tetrodes and powerful pentodes. The pentode is a recent invention commonly used in the final stage of audio frequency amplification vacuum tubes. It has sensitive action and powerful screen output. Now, we use a powerful pentode to construct a regenerative single-tube radio. According to the author's experimental results, its efficiency is very excellent. It can be used with a speaker to receive broadcasts from local broadcasting stations with very loud sound. The sound quality is also very beautiful and clear, (such as Nanjing, Tokyo, Hangzhou, Taipei) and the power supply is all taken from alternating current, so the maintenance cost is very low. It is now specially introduced:</p>
<p>L1, L2, and L3 are three-circuit regenerative coils. Use American standard 26-gauge silk-covered wire wound on a spider-web-style board. L1 has 30 turns, with a tap extracted at the 20th turn for receiving shorter wavelengths. L2 has 75 turns. L3 has 35 turns. L4 has 75 turns.</p>
<p>C1 is a 13-plate variable capacitor with a capacitance of 0.00025 microfarads. C2 is a 0.0001 fixed capacitor. C3 is a 1 microfarad fixed capacitor. C4 is the same as C1. C5 is a 0.02 fixed capacitor. C6 and C7 are 2 microfarad fixed capacitors. R1 is a 40-ohm center-tapped resistor. R2 is a 1,000-ohm fixed resistor. T is a 6:1 low-frequency transformer. CD is a compound carbon fixed crystal. V1 is a 47 direct-heated pentode. V2 is a RR2A vacuum tube. OPT is a power transformer. The primary uses a 220-volt AC power supply. The secondary has a high voltage of 180 volts and a current of 40 milliamperes, a low voltage of 5 volts, 2.5 amperes, and 2.5 volts, 1.75 amperes. AFC is a low-frequency choke coil with a self-inductance of 30 henries and a current capacity of 30 milliamperes.</p>
<p>Using Radio Waves to Calculate the Time in Various Locations</p>
<p>The Earth revolves around the sun and also rotates on its axis. Two locations on opposite sides of the Earth, along a diameter, have noon and midnight respectively. Radio waves travel at a speed of approximately 186,500 miles per second and can circle the Earth 7.5 times. From this, it can be seen that radio waves can reach any location instantaneously. However, a radio wave emitted at noon in one location in the Eastern Hemisphere can be received instantaneously in a location in the Western Hemisphere, but that location in the Western Hemisphere would be at midnight. Based on this, every 180 degrees of longitude between two locations corresponds to a 12-hour difference. Every 15 degrees of longitude corresponds to a 1-hour difference. One degree of longitude is approximately 200 li (Chinese miles), so 15 degrees corresponds to 3,000 li, which is a 1-hour difference. For example, the time at which radio waves broadcast from Shanghai at noon are received at various locations varies. Ningbo, Yantai, and Yingkou are all on the same longitude, so the reception time is the same. If Shanghai broadcasts at noon, and you receive it in Chengdu, the difference in longitude is approximately 18 degrees, so the reception time will be different. If you want to receive a radio wave broadcast from Shanghai at noon, you should tune in at 10:48 AM, but Chengdu is west of Shanghai, so when Shanghai is facing the sun at noon, it is still before noon in Chengdu, hence 10:48 AM. If you receive the Shanghai noon broadcast in Nagasaki, Japan, the difference in longitude is approximately 8 degrees, and Nagasaki is east of Shanghai, so the reception time will be later than Shanghai, at 12:32 PM. From the above, it can be seen that a difference of 1 degree of longitude corresponds to a time difference of 4 minutes. Also, the reception time is later at locations east of the broadcasting station and earlier at locations west of the broadcasting station. From this, the time at various locations can be calculated.</p>
<p>Small Experiment: Converting a Broken Variable Resistor into a Multi-Tap Wavelength Selector</p>
<p>Remove the original broken wire. Based on the number of taps desired, distribute the positions appropriately on the original winding location and wind several sets of wires. Polishing each set with three to five turns is sufficient. The removed wire can still be used to save effort, or you can leave several sets of wires when removing them. In the diagram, A is labeled to be connected to each tap of the coil, and E is labeled to be connected to the grounding end of the coil. This completes the conversion and it is more aesthetically pleasing than using a common tap switch on the radio.</p>
<p>The Principle of Non-Polarized Feedback VT</p>
<p>In the previous issue, this publication published an article by Mr. Yisun about the "Traveling Non-Polarized Feedback Radio in a Cigar Box," which aroused great interest among readers. There were questions about unclear points. In addition to requesting Mr. Yisun to provide detailed answers, we are publishing Mr. VT's article on the "Principle of Non-Polarized Feedback" below:</p>
<p>Non-Polarized Feedback (Superregeneration) is also translated as super-regenerative. The method involves inducing extreme oscillation in the radio and controlling it with low-frequency oscillation. The radio's sensitivity is highest when it is oscillating, as experienced by those using ordinary feedback radios. However, once oscillation occurs, the audio quality deteriorates, impairing the radio's function. If the radio is induced to oscillate and the oscillation is made to start and stop abruptly, the audio quality will not deteriorate, and the radio will be very sensitive. The control method also uses oscillating current, but one with a very low frequency. The feedback force of the radio is very strong, and it is always in an oscillating state. Simultaneously, a low-frequency oscillating current is supplied to the grid of the vacuum tube. If the supplied current is positive, the radio oscillates; when it is negative, the oscillation stops.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure A, a is the received radio wave, b is the low-frequency oscillating current, and c is the interrupted frequency oscillating current (Interrupted Frequency). As can be seen from the figure, when B is positive, oscillation starts; in the negative half-wave, oscillation stops, and the high-frequency current is at its maximum when oscillating. In this way, the audio current in the headphones is intermittently strong, as shown in Figure d, which can be strengthened without deteriorating the audio quality.</p>
<p>The Armstrong method, the inventor of this method, originally used a line with coils of 1,250 turns and 1,500 turns, and a .001 MFD variable capacitor to generate a low-frequency oscillating current. However, this type of line is not easy to make and is expensive, so it is rarely used. However, the one used in the previous manuscript is the Colpitts oscillation circuit. Its line is shown in Figure 2. And it is the one shown by the thick line in Figure 3. There are several other types of non-polarized feedback circuits, which will not be described in detail here. (The line in the third figure is the same as the one in the previous issue, because the drawing in the previous issue was slightly blurred, so it was redrawn)</p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>This method can be used without a large antenna and can be listened to using only a loop antenna. The method of installing the loop antenna is to change the L1 line coil, or to make another loop antenna and insert it into the grid circuit (as in the blank space in Figure 3). However, the total amount of daily inductance of L1 and the loop antenna should match the wavelength being received.</p>
<p>The type of vacuum tube used is not limited. Any vacuum tube that is not old and can oscillate can be used. However, for convenience of portability, it is advisable to use direct current. Finally, because this method is highly sensitive, it is inevitable that there will be noise. And if it is not made properly, it is easy to fail. However, because it is convenient to carry and economical in terms of electricity, it is worthy of our research.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers about the Radio in a Cigar Box by Yisun</p>
<p>(1) The original text can be found in QT, March 1932.</p>
<p>(2) This machine is designed for travel, so the antenna is omitted. (If L1 and L2 are wound on a plastic tube with a small gap in the middle, then the two ends of L1 are connected to the antenna. This was not stated in the original manuscript, so it is added here.) The antenna coil L1 can be used as a substitute for the antenna. Wind it in parallel along the outer edge of the cigar box, and its effect is the same as that of a loop antenna. (See item 5)</p>
<p>(3) In experiments, a B battery with 45V is most suitable. However, if the machine does not oscillate under other circumstances, the B voltage can be increased.</p>
<p>(4) Only vacuum tubes that save power are used to meet the purpose of being lightweight. However, it must be determined by experimentation because the characteristics of the vacuum tube sometimes make it necessary to increase or decrease L2.</p>
<p>(5) The parts used are listed in detail below:</p>
<p>C1: 50ppfd variable capacitor (i.e., 0.0005mfd)</p>
<p>C2: 0.0012lfd fixed mica capacitor</p>
<p>C3: 0.00006pfd fixed mica capacitor</p>
<p>L1: Grid coil, a total of 40 turns. Taps at the 9th, 12th, 15th, 20th, 26th, 32nd, and 40th turns (counting from the grid end), each tap is connected to a screw. The coil is wound on the side of the box.</p>
<p>L2: Plate coil, a total of 17 turns. A total of 9 taps, starting from the positive pole of the B battery to the 9th turn. The coil is wound on a wooden frame that is sized to fit inside L1. The gap in the middle is the wooden board of the box. (The plastic tube with a diameter of 2 inches in the previous manuscript is for installing the antenna.)</p>
<p>L3: Low-frequency choke coil.</p>
<p>R1: 50-ohm variable filament resistor.</p>
<p>B1: A battery, used to ignite the filament. (2.3 Volts)</p>
<p>S1: A set of active rotating nails (7 tapSwitch)</p>
<p>S2: A set of active rotating nails (9 tapSwitch)</p>
<p>Here, I would like to clarify to the readers that this radio is intended for light and convenient travel, so the number and weight of the parts are reduced to a minimum. As a result, the volume may be slightly lower than that of an ordinary single-tube radio.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign News:</p>
<p>"Fada" Brand Radios Enjoy High Reputation in the United States. "Fada" brand radios are one of the most famous radios in the United States. In China, they are managed by the "Meida Foreign Firm" on the third floor of Hamilton House on Jiangxi Road. Two types, seven-tube and nine-tube, have recently arrived and have been well received by the public since their release. Many electronic materials stores have sold a lot of them in recent days, and buyers are very satisfied. The company has samples available and will send them upon request. The internal structure of the machine is shown in detail in the diagram. It is heard that the company also has a "Kraus" brand five-tube machine, which is very affordable and suitable for both local and out-of-town use, and the business is also very prosperous.</p>
<p>The Sales of "Bailo" Brand Radios are Booming. "Bailo" brand radios have been sold in China for six or seven years and have always been praised by buyers for their sturdy components and reasonable prices. A new batch of goods arrived last month, and there is not much left, so buyers must act quickly. When purchasing "Bailo" brand radios, be careful of counterfeits and pay attention to the "Rudder Industry" logo to avoid being deceived.</p>
<p>"Dahua" Wireless Radio Company's Business is Booming. "Dahua" Wireless Radio Company was founded by radio pioneers Mr. Cao Zhongyuan and Mr. Li Weishou and is famous for custom-made radios, ship-borne and military-use transmitters and receivers. This summer, many Yangtze River and North China Sea steamships have ordered custom-made units, and people who are spending their summer vacations are also ordering various types of radios. It is said that anyone who wants to buy a radio must order it one month in advance.</p>
<p>"Yousi" Brand Radios are About to Arrive. The famous American "Yousi" brand radios arrived last month and were sold out in three days at the radio exhibition held by this newspaper. The second batch of goods is about to arrive at the end of the month, and those who want to buy them must order them two weeks in advance.</p>
<p>"Gospel" for Direct Current Radios. Regarding direct current radios, the most troublesome and difficult thing is the problem of A batteries and B batteries. Although foreign goods are relatively durable, they are too expensive and difficult to handle. Domestic products often follow the old methods without knowing how to improve them, so those who use foreign dry batteries often regret that they are not durable. It has recently been learned that "Jianhua" Wireless Radio Company, located at 393 Fuxu Road in this city, has concentrated its manpower and financial resources to carefully research and improve the manufacture of both A and B batteries several months ago. The first batch of products had slightly inferior raw material composition, and there was no outstanding feature compared to the products sold on the market. The company believed that it did not achieve its purpose and has made several improvements. Recently, the experiment was successful, and the result was unexpectedly successful. Not only is there no domestic product that can compete with it, but even foreign products are not slightly inferior. It is also heard that the company recalled all the batteries that were wholesaled to other locations the other day and replaced them with the latest products.</p>

<p>Free Discussion: Children's Literature by Zhu</p>
<p>I heard that there are quite a few people in the new book industry who are planning to compile more children's literature. Their focus is mostly on children's literature for the lower grades. This may be because lower-grade reading materials are easier to write and print and because objective needs are also urgent; or because the impoverished China's cheap little booklets are easy to sell, and the business is secure; or because the new book industry is constrained by financial resources and has to start small. Being able to systematically compile and print children's literature is always beneficial to children; but my prejudice is that the most urgent need at present is for children's literature for the upper grades. And among these readings, scientific and historical readings are particularly lacking.</p>
<p>I often think this way: Children's desire for knowledge develops with age, so eleven- or twelve-year-old children, if they are not low-ability, find pure literary readings monotonous; and in literary readings, they like historical themes. At the same time, their curiosity has also developed to a reasonable degree, and they demand reasonable scientific explanations for the universe and novel things. They no longer believe in mythical stories of the origins of things, and they twist their mothers' arms and ask her to "tell the truth." But it is not easy to satisfy children's historical interests and "tell the truth." If it is too historical, they find it boring; if it is too scientific, they do not understand it. It is necessary to put a literary coating on the substance of history and science in order to satisfy children. The Soviet fairy tale What Time Is It? (already available in Chinese translation) is one example. Although this book is a bit too advanced for twelve-year-old children, the style is worth learning from. I think that high-level historical and scientific children's readings are urgently needed at present.</p>
<p>I propose a publishing plan for everyone's reference: Number of words: 30,000 to 40,000. Any less is not enough to narrate. Themes: A general discussion of human anatomy; the structure, function, and hygiene of various organs; types of food and clothing and their hygiene; this is the first category. The origin of the universe, the wonders of nature; coal, kerosene, where do they come from, how mankind conquered nature; this is the second category. The living conditions of various peoples on earth, this is the third category. New inventions in science, such as photography, movies, telegraphs, telephones, phonographs, etc., this is the fourth category. Regarding history, such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Boxer Rebellion, the Opium War, and even Confucius traveling around the states, this is the fifth category. Style: Naturally, a story style with a strong literary flavor should be used. For example, when talking about the types of food or clothing and their hygiene, one can start with what primitive people ate and wore, and include the history of human food and clothing; when talking about our current food and clothing, one can narrate the main procedures for producing food and clothing materials. At the same time, various types of themes should also be related. For example, the structure and function of the ear can be linked to the structural principle of the telephone, and the eyes can be linked to the camera. Historical themes such as Confucius traveling around the states should describe the social, political, and economic conditions of that time, and should restore the "Great Accomplished Sage and Teacher" to that ordinary person who was eager to become an official at that time. It is easy to come up with a topic, but difficult to write an article, especially for children's readings, the article must be profound and easy to understand. But I believe that if there is a need, facts will happen.</p>
<p>Imprisoned Beauty by Lin Weiyin</p>
<p>Even in a zoo full of strange birds and animals, the peacock still feels that he is the most beautiful. He has patterns that painters cannot paint and colors that cannot be mixed; he has rhymes and rhythms that poets cannot sing and harmonies that musicians cannot play. The colors of the rainbow are inspired by him; the sun is only brilliant for him. He has everything beautiful. He is all beauty.</p>
<p>But now, he is in the zoo. Although he still has all beauty, still is all beauty, this is just a luminous pearl in a tomb, a concubine in the harem of a tyrant. He is mocked by the sun and ridiculed by the rainbow. Although he still feels that he is the most beautiful creature, he cannot diminish the sadness of being imprisoned in his heart; and because he still feels this way, the sadness in his heart is even more infinite and endless.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to tear his beauty apart and discard his ornate decorations, but when his beak was about to peck at his first feather, he would pity himself, indulge himself, and finally stop his beak from advancing, he was unwilling to destroy himself. He wanted to keep it for himself to admire.</p>
<p>He often opens his screen, and the neat patterns and rich colors make himself happy and give him a moment of comfort. He loves to see the feathers under both wings, hanging down softly like the eyelashes of a narcissus. He proudly swivels his steps, flaunting his beauty to the void. But in the middle of the screen's full bloom, he would suddenly feel that he was just flaunting himself, and it didn't seem to have any meaning - he would tremble every one of his feathers, like a dense rain of falling stars, then he would sadly cry out twice and silently withdraw his wings.</p>
<p>Thief Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>Ma Guoliang returned to the editorial office in the morning, opened the Shen Bao, and saw a large-character headline advertisement posted by the "Hong Kong Da Ying Bank Buying Office" offering a reward for the arrest of thief Ma Guoliang. Under the "Portrait of Thief Ma Guoliang" were printed the following words:</p>
<p>"Ma Guoliang, from Taishan County, Guangdong Province, is 27 or 28 years old. On June 2nd of the national calendar, he stole 50,000 Hong Kong dollars from the Hong Kong Da Ying Bank and absconded without a trace. Anyone who can bring him to justice will be rewarded with 2,000 silver dollars. If cash is seized on the spot, 20% will be drawn out as a reward and we will never break our promise. This announcement..."</p>
<p>Although some people have predicted that people will abandon names in the future and replace them with numbers, this has not yet been implemented. China has 400 to 500 million people, and everyone's names are selected from the same dictionary. Naturally, there will be occasional coincidences where 400 to 500 million names are identical. However, the coincidence between me and this Ma Guoliang is that I am also from Guangdong (but I am from Taide County, not Taishan County) and I am 26 years old this year, which is not much different from this brother's "27 or 28 years old". Not only are the names coincidental, but also the place of origin and age are about the same. The world is so big, there is really no "coincidence" without it.</p>
<p>After reading the newspaper, the next thing that came was phone calls from acquaintances and strangers asking questions (of course, they would not suspect that I, this Ma Guoliang, was that Ma Guoliang, but just talk about it as a fun thing.) Some even thought it through for me and advised me to post a notice next to the reward explaining the misunderstanding. I am grateful for the well-intentioned concern of my friends, but as for posting a notice to explain, I think it is unnecessary to do so. Since people are not chasing me, why should I quibble?</p>
<p>There is no absolute good and evil in the world. Whether it is meritorious or sinful depends on each person's position. In Hugo's Les Miserables, the protagonist Jean Valjean stole someone else's bread in order to feed his nephews and was imprisoned. Who doesn't feel sorry for him? Wu Yong used a plan to rob the Birthday Gang, and Liangshanbo called him a hero, but the imperial court issued an arrest warrant for them. It can be seen that there is no fixed standard for good and evil. Why did this Ma Guoliang steal 50,000 yuan? Not knowing the inside story, although I will not defend him, I will never complain that he has tarnished my name.</p>
<p>Someone commits a crime and steals money. This is not only his personal shame but the shame of all mankind. People cannot live contentedly, and eventually, some people take risks and commit crimes. On whose head should this curse fall? Look at this world, isn't everything that is going on every day an act of theft, deception, and robbery? It's just that the means are different, and the status is different. The powerless are chased after stealing, and the powerful are still safe after robbing. Don't believe it, just look at the many people who have been robbed and cannot survive. Can they still come up with 2,000 yuan to offer a reward for the arrest of their principal offender? "Those who steal hooks are punished, and those who steal a country become princes." The world is full of this, how can you complain about so many things?</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to Yangshupu and passed by a magnificent building. I asked a friend who was traveling with me and learned that it was a prison. At that time, I not only regretted that this beautiful and magnificent building was a "symbol of human shame" (see Mr. Ye Zikai's words), but also thought in my heart that the people locked inside were not necessarily all truly criminals. And we, who are outside the prison, are we all as innocent as babes, and no one is qualified to be locked in prison? In this era of difficult-to-distinguish good and evil, why should I post a notice in the newspaper to declare my innocence and contrast with this unfortunate compatriot of the same name?</p>
<p>2,000 yuan is indeed a considerable amount of money. Many of my relatives and friends are struggling in poverty. If it were possible, I would be willing to bring myself, this useless person, to justice so that my poor relatives and friends could get 2,000 yuan and be comfortable for a while. At most, I would just sit in prison, which is also very worthwhile, I think.</p>
<p>About Fart Literature by He Ru</p>
<p>"Although it is a fart, it is also literature." I recently saw in a certain publication Hu Huaichen's Random Notes on Sapo Racecourse XII, Notes on Fart Literature (already seen in Juhu Xu Yu) A textual research stating that "Wing Pi" recorded in Jiang Zizheng's Shanfang Notes "If you look at it, you can't see it, it is called "Xi," if you listen to it, you can't hear it, it is called "Yi." It is as if it comes out of his mouth, and everyone covers their noses and passes by." The first two sentences are from Lao Tzu, but there are some errors. It is also said that farts originally have sound and cannot be said to be unheard. It should be changed according to Lao Tzu's original text: "If you look at it, you can't see it, it is called "Yi," if you try to grasp it, you can't get it, it is called "Wei." It is as if it comes out of his mouth, and everyone covers their noses and passes by." According to this public, he once changed the poems in the "Essays" collection and suffered a ridicule from the Saint Hu. He also once changed Liu Zongyuan's texts and was greatly ridiculed by Wang Yunliu, Xiaofeng, and Xuanzhi. Now, he is once again using his own ideas and writing to change the poetry of Divine Child Lin, is it impossible to stop him?</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers by Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>"Stand here," Le Bic said. "This is a great place. I'll take the dog for a walk in the woods; we'll drive out the woodcock, and when you hear the pjtpit call, you have to prick up your ears and open your eyes. The woodcock will fly over your head."</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers held the shotgun in his arms. This was the first time in his life that he was preparing to shoot a woodcock. He had used Le Bic's gun to kill a quail, knock off a few bamboo chicken feathers, and run away a wild hare. He hit the quail while lying on the ground, under the nose of the towering hunting dog. He looked at it at first, but he didn't see it clearly - that small, earth-colored ball.</p>
<p>"Back up a bit," Le Bic said to him, "you're too close." But Red Carrot Whiskers instinctively took another step forward, put the gun to his shoulder, fired at close range, and shot the small gray ball into the ground. He only found some broken, disappearing feathers and a bloody beak. But if a young hunter wants to become famous, it is better to kill a woodcock, so Red Carrot Whiskers should make this night valuable in his life.</p>
<p>It's easy to see things wrong at dusk. At this time, everything becomes hazy. A mosquito flying by can disturb us like thunder approaching. Therefore, Red Carrot Whiskers stood there very moved, hoping that things would end quickly. Several thrushes returned from the pasture and quickly flew into the oak tree. He aimed at them, practicing his eyesight. He wiped the water vapor that darkened the barrel of the gun with his sleeve.</p>
<p>Here and there some leaves fell. There were indeed two woodcocks. Their long beaks made them fly awkwardly. They flew up from the ground, chasing each other intimately, circling over the trembling woods. They made a pitpit call, just as Le Bic had said, but very softly, making Red Carrot Whiskers suspect that they hadn't flown to his side. He blinked his eyes repeatedly. He saw two shadows passing over his head, so he put the handle of the gun on his stomach and fired a shot at the sky. One of the two woodcocks fell down, beak forward, and the startling gunshot echoed from all around the woods.</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers picked up the woodcock, whose wings had been broken, waved it triumphantly, and smelled the smell of gunpowder. Pila麦 ran in front of Le Bic, who was walking as usual, neither slow nor fast.</p>
<p>"He must be very surprised," Red Carrot Whiskers thought, preparing to receive some praise. But Le Bic parted the branches, walked out, and said to his son, who still smelled of gunpowder, in a calm voice: "Why didn't you shoot them both down?"</p>
<p>Fishing Hook Red Carrot Whiskers was gutting the fish he had caught himself, which included river sand fish, silver white fish, and perch. He scraped off their scales with a knife, cut open their bellies, and trampled on their transparent air sacs with his feet. He collected the fish innards in one place, preparing to feed the cat. He hurriedly buried himself in his work, leaning over the bucket full of white foam, careful not to get himself wet.</p>
<p>Le Bic's family ran over to take a look. "This is well done," she said. "You caught us a meal of fried fish today. You can fish very well if you want to." She stroked his neck and shoulders, but when she took her hand back, she let out a few painful cries. A fishing hook pierced her fingertip. Sister Erlesding hurried over, and her brother Felix followed behind her. Soon Mr. Le Bic also came.</p>
<p>"Show me your hand," they said. But she pressed her hand on her skirt,夹在两膝之间, and the hook went in deeper. When her brother Felix and sister Erlesding held her, Le Bic grabbed her arm, held it up high, so everyone could see. The fishing hook had pierced her finger through and through.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<p>Financial Exchange Rates Plunge, Gold Prices Soar in August</p>
<p>After the US Treasury Secretary Denied Stabilizing Exchange Rates, the Market Slightly Recovered.</p>
<p>The gold market began trading for August yesterday. The situation turned from firm to weak. Initially, foreign telegrams showed the Bank of England rising and the Bank of America falling. Exchange rates contracted sharply. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by five to eight tenths of a cent. US cotton fell by more than forty pounds per sound. US wheat fell by a little over one cent. Stocks fell sharply by more than five yuan. Short sellers painfully closed their positions. The raw silk market rose sharply from fifteen or sixteen yuan to over twenty-one or two yuan. Finally, although the private telegram silver price fell by three and one-eighth cents, the floor hardened. The opening was lower than the previous recovery. After the opening, it fluctuated with the rise and fall of the exchange rate market. The situation was mediocre. The market was initially tired and then flat. Bombay initially contracted by two annas and then remained unchanged. Both had little impact. The market situation was still quiet throughout the day. Reuters reported that there was talk in the United States of stopping the expansion of currency. After the opening, although it rose, it still retreated. Although there was news in the morning that the UK had repaid US debt of 20 million (silver), it was actually the telegram from the previous day, so there was no change. In the afternoon, US Treasury Secretary Woodin announced that he denied stabilizing exchange rates, and a downward trend was seen, with the clam shell price increasing by 100 yuan. Now, the day's situation is recorded below</p>
<p>The Establishment of the Outline Proposal for Consolidating the Postal Foundation</p>
<p>The Postal Economic System Research Committee concluded its session the day before yesterday, having passed the "Implementation Outline for Consolidating the Postal Foundation Scheme." Since the establishment of this committee, spanning one year and twenty days, we have first read its specialized committee report, gaining a complete understanding of the situation of our country's postal service. Now, we are even more delighted to see the completion of this proposal through the collaboration of all parties. However, our discussion of this matter today does not solely focus on this aspect.</p>
<p>Firstly, among the various administrative systems in our country, the postal system, along with the customs system, is renowned for its excellence and soundness. However, customs administration still has a portion controlled by foreigners. Since the recovery of postal rights, the postal service has become a completely self-managed transportation administration by our country. Therefore, even if we say that postal administration is the touchstone of our country's administration, it would not be an overstatement. Our country has been advocating for the improvement of the administrative system for many years. As of today, the perfection of administration has not surpassed the postal and customs services, which is enough to show that the matter is not easy. In recent years, news of potential instability in the postal system has frequently appeared in newspapers. Postal employees have launched a movement to consolidate the postal foundation. Last year, postal workers across the country even resorted to strikes as a means of petitioning. Through the mediation of leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, the strike ended. The Executive Yuan sent a letter to appoint committee members to study the plan for consolidating the postal foundation, so as to make suggestions to the government for adoption and implementation. The plan passed now, on the one hand, is undoubtedly a perfect tool to end the movement to consolidate the postal foundation. On the other hand, it is the manifestation of the painstaking efforts of the government authorities, postal employees, and mediators in maintaining this excellent and sound administrative system.</p>
<p>Secondly, the movement to consolidate the postal foundation has been ongoing for five years and has become a difficult administrative matter. Postal employees were concerned about the destruction of the existing perfect system and fought tirelessly. The transportation authorities, on the other hand, believed that what the employees were fighting for involved national administration and was not in line with the proper norms. With the two forces holding their ground, it was not easy to compromise. During the outbreak of the turmoil, those directly responsible for postal administration, such as the Director-General of the Postal Administration and the Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications, were even dismissed and detained in a difficult position. The seriousness of the content of this incident is evident. Finally, the Central People's Training Committee and the Minister of Industry flew to Shanghai to handle the matter properly. The mayor and leaders from all walks of life came forward to mediate. The first step was to persuade the workers to resume work. After more than a year of effort, this plan, full of compromise, was formulated. We believe that the content of this plan can be temporarily set aside, and the way it forms a solution to disputes can be taken as a model for those who seek to solve problems in today's society where disputes are emerging endlessly.</p>
<p>We comprehensively review the facts since the occurrence of the movement to consolidate the postal foundation and believe that the complete resolution of this incident has reached more than 90%. We deeply hope that the government can adopt and implement it as soon as possible, so that the postal system can be guaranteed and will not be shaken, and encourage society to resolve disputes in a spirit of compromise.</p>
<p>The Future of the Economic Conference</p>
<h3>Ma Yinchu's Observations</h3>
<p>Ma Yinchu of Nanjing discussed that the important agenda of the World Economic Conference includes stabilizing currency prices, abandoning tariff policies, abolishing exchange restrictions, and limiting price increases. In fact, stabilizing currency prices, abandoning tariff policies, and abolishing exchange restrictions are all intended to raise prices. Raising prices cannot be a standalone issue. The reason why prices cannot be raised is that the goods produced by various countries cannot circulate domestically and internationally, leading to overproduction of certain goods in certain areas, which must be sold at reduced prices. The reason why goods cannot circulate smoothly is due to the tariff barriers of various countries in the world, as well as the currency wars and exchange restrictions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Currently, if Europe and the United States want to save the crisis of overproduction, unemployment, and panic, they can only solve the problem by eliminating these trade barriers. Various countries in the world, in order to protect their own economies, have built high tariff barriers to exclude foreign goods. As a result, all countries are unable to clearly understand the existing quantity of various products and the quantity needed at any time to make appropriate production arrangements, thus trapping various countries in a form of production under anarchy and creating today's most serious phenomenon of overproduction, unemployment, and panic. Moreover, due to the high tariff barriers, surplus goods cannot be imported into countries with shortages, and those in need cannot obtain adjustments of surplus goods. Goods cannot circulate, and production prices are too low. The most important proposition of stabilizing currency prices in various countries is to restore the gold standard. Because after the restoration of the gold standard, on the one hand, various countries can avoid the indiscriminate issuance of irresponsible paper money. On the other hand, after the currency system adopts the same unit, various countries can avoid using their different and uncertain currency prices to prevent the import of goods from other countries. The United Kingdom and the United States should be able to reach a consensus on this. France, in canceling artificial manipulation, basically cancels exchange restrictions and can also agree. If currency prices can be stabilized, there will be a great guarantee in commercial exchange. This is also a way to circulate goods and raise prices. The adoption of exchange restrictions is due to the instability of currency prices, so this labor-intensive method is used to retaliate against other countries' currency wars. This is actually the same as the currency price problem as an obstacle to smooth currency circulation. Therefore, if you want prices to be high, you cannot but abolish exchange restrictions. The above three are all so-called important financial policies of various countries at present. Their original intention was to protect their own trade, but the result was the tragic situation of today's world economic bankruptcy. The war debt problem is the most serious problem and a prerequisite for saving the economic recession. If it cannot be resolved one day, then none of the above problems can have a satisfactory result. In this conference, China only has a closer relationship with the silver price problem. Because China's tariffs are fundamentally under the control of others, there is no so-called tariff problem, let alone a currency system problem and an exchange problem. As for the silver price problem, what our country hopes for is the stability of the silver price, and the United States hopes to raise the silver price. If China and the United States cooperate to solve this problem, it must be resolved under the principle of "raising the silver price and then stabilizing it." However, the current silver price in the United States has soared a lot. The exchange rate has only risen by 15%, but in the past, one ounce of American silver was worth 21 cents of American dollars, and now one ounce has risen to 37 cents of American dollars. Therefore, every month, the Shanghai banking community transports as much as 30 million yuan of silver into the United States. This is really a problem that deserves our serious attention. Mr. Ma made a conclusion on the World Economic Conference, saying that there are still many hidden reefs in the future of the conference, and the representatives of various countries have not come purely for economic issues. The results cannot be predicted, but there will always be some results. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>World Economic Conference</p>
<h3>General Debate Ends, Practical Work Begins</h3>
<p>Establishment of the Financial and Economic Trade Committees</p>
<p>American and Dutch Representatives Elected as Chairmen, Separate Meetings Held Yesterday</p>
<p>No Real Compromise Yet on Currency Stabilization Between the UK and the US</p>
<p>The general debate of the London World Economic Conference, which was thought to last until tomorrow morning, ended this afternoon. The committees nominated will begin work on Friday. British Prime Minister Baldwin, when called upon to speak by the chairman, was not present at the meeting. It turned out that Baldwin and many other representatives were stuck in the elevator when it suddenly stopped midway while they were going upstairs, causing him to arrive two minutes after the adjournment was announced. However, the chairman still allowed him to take the stage and express his views. Baldwin strongly advocated for the reduction of public and private debts. After Baldwin finished his speech, Chairman MacDonald announced the end of the general debate, saying, "This is the most organized and smooth conference I have ever chaired." The general debate ended at 6:06 this evening (Reuters dispatch on the 15th).</p>
<p>The two committees established by the London World Economic Conference are the Economic and Trade Committee and the Financial Committee. Each committee has one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and one rapporteur. The first committee, the Economic and Trade Committee, has elected Dutch Prime Minister Dr. Colijn as chairman, with Hamburg Mayor Krogmann of Germany and Don Laibari of Argentina as vice-chairmen. The steering committee failed to recommend a candidate for rapporteur, so the Economic and Trade Committee will elect one at its meeting this morning. The second committee, initially named the Monetary Committee, is now renamed the Financial Committee, with American representative Cox elected as chairman, Italian representative Jung as vice-chairman, and French representative Ponlet as rapporteur. Another vice-chairman has now been added, with Austrian National Bank President Chambon elected. Both committees will meet at 11 o'clock this morning (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>Financial and Economic Committees</p>
<h3>Separate Meetings Held Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Financial Committee</p>
<p>American Representative Cox Chairs</p>
<p>Mutual Encouragement to Seek Practicality</p>
<p>Large Countries Manipulate the Steering Committee</p>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries Quite Dissatisfied</p>
<p>The Monetary and Financial Committee of the London World Economic Conference began its work today, opening at 11:08 am in the General Assembly Hall. American representative Cox chaired. All representatives elected as financial committee members attended the meeting. The chairman delivered an opening speech, hoping that the committee would live up to the trust of the General Assembly and advocating that the committee should do more work and less empty talk. The committee members should know the importance of patience and understanding. So-called patience means not seeking quick results, and so-called understanding means knowing the situation of various countries. He also said that public trust is sacred, and we should increase public trust with knowledgeable and unremitting efforts. Gentlemen, let us begin our work. The chairman then suggested that a steering committee be formed by the staff of the committee and the representatives of the United States, Germany, Finland, and Czechoslovakia to handle the establishment of various subcommittees so that each group can separately prepare submissions. The chairman answered British representative Chamberlain's question, saying that the steering committee would contact all subcommittees and individuals, and that several committee members now want to submit monetary plans. He advocated that the plans should be submitted as soon as possible for printing. The chairman then asked Italian Finance Minister Jung to reiterate the opinions he had previously expressed at the meeting of the staff of the two committees. The Italian Finance Minister then rose and gave a speech briefly outlining his general debate and stating the monetary and economic problems that must be solved simultaneously. He said that although he firmly believed in the necessity of simultaneous solutions, he was afraid that if this proposal was adopted as a procedure, the General Assembly would not be able to establish a way to solve its difficulties. He also said that the various committees should identify various difficulties, which can always be resolved satisfactorily so that they can each handle their own affairs. The Monetary and Financial Committee adjourned at 11:38 am and will reconvene on Monday morning so that the committee can complete its work. The complex procedures of the Financial Committee are quite confusing to the committee members, but their effect is to speed up the work of establishing subcommittees. In the future, the real work of the Financial Committee will be handled by the various subcommittees separately. The steering committee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 pm today (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>The steering committee established by the Monetary Committee of the London World Economic Conference met at 3:00 pm today. It is now believed that the steering committee will hold closed-door discussions for a long time on the proposal put forward by Swedish representative Palmschierna, namely that the Monetary Committee should not only take the annotated agenda as the basis for discussion, but also take the declaration of British Finance Minister Chamberlain as the basis for discussion. Judging from the phenomenon, the Swedish representative's proposal seems to be able to be adopted by the public. At the same time, small countries have expressed a sense of dissatisfaction, believing that the conference affairs are now quite manipulated by large countries, and cited the fact that Belgium was not included in today's steering committee as proof (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<h3>Economic Committee</h3>
<p>Chaired by the Dutch Prime Minister</p>
<p>Plan to Categorize Committee Affairs</p>
<p>Adjourned to Continue on Monday</p>
<p>The Economic and Trade Committee of the London World Economic Conference held its first meeting this morning in the north hall of the meeting hall. Chairman Colijn stated that he had determined the classification of committee affairs as follows: (A) Normalization of commerce, and plans for the mutual exchange of imported goods, and the gradual abolition of import quotas and prohibitions. (B) Problems such as subsidy tariffs and treaty policies, including most-favored-nation clauses and their exceptions, and direct or indirect subsidies. (C) Comprehensive planning for production and marketing, including food and raw materials, and the handling of industrial combination problems. (D) Public works problems. The meeting procedure of the Trade Committee today was very simple. The chairman stated that the general discussion had ended yesterday, so there should be no more speeches of a general nature today. The committee members had little questions about the chairman's temporary proposed method of classifying committee affairs. However, British Business Minister Hinsley suggested that the subsidy issue was of great importance and should be handled by a separate staff committee, but this matter could be discussed by the chairman in consultation with the vice-chairman and the secretariat. Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov asked, if there is a matter that belongs to both categories, who should decide its category? The chairman replied that this matter should be determined by the chairman. When announcing the adjournment, the chairman asked the representatives to submit their written suggestions so that they could be compiled for the representatives to study on Sunday. With Colijn as chairman of the Economic and Trade Committee, the progress of committee affairs has been greatly facilitated. Not only does Mr. Cox speak fluent English, but he also speaks slowly and clearly, so that the audience can hear him clearly. He also has a humorous characteristic in his serious work, which often makes the participants laugh. When adjourning the meeting, Mr. Cox announced that four pounds of British currency had been picked up in the meeting place, and the loser could go to the secretariat to claim it. As he spoke, he made a gesture of everyone rushing to claim it, which was hilarious. The Trade Committee adjourned at 11:45 am and is scheduled to reconvene at 11:00 am on Monday morning (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Countries Join the Tariff Truce</h3>
<p>Japan Temporarily Observes the Situation</p>
<p>Then Decide on Response Policy</p>
<p>Extremely Angry at the Attitude of the Indian Government</p>
<p>As of last night in London, 27 countries have joined the tariff truce, namely the UK, France, Germany, Belgium, the US, Italy, Japan, the West Indies, Argentina, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland,</p>
<p>Latvia, Nicaragua, Sweden, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Denmark, Romania, India, Brazil, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria. Luxembourg is also included. However, most countries attached reservations when joining (Havas dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>Tokyo According to the report received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today from the delegation to the Economic Conference, Speaker MacDonald asked the Japanese delegation to withdraw the reservations on the tariff truce and join the plan as soon as possible. As a result of careful consideration by the Treaty and Commerce Bureaus and the Legislative Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the tariff truce is also attached with reservations by various countries, and it does not have legal binding force on the participating countries, if Japan withdraws its reservations and participates, Japan's position will be bound. Therefore, no statement of participation will be issued at this time. The attitude will be decided after temporarily observing the situation of the conference (United Press dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>Tokyo The Indian government announced on the 15th that it will participate in the tariff truce of the organizing committee of the Economic Conference. According to the telegram, before the notification of participation, it was found that there were reservations attached to the formulated laws. The government's participation in the truce is only a formality and is extremely insincere. The Japanese Foreign Affairs authorities are very angry (Cable News dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>Deferred Payment of Stable Exchange Rate</p>
<h3>Fate Tied to the United States</h3>
<p>The US and France Compete for the Position of Committee Chairman</p>
<p>Almost Causing a Pause in Committee Affairs</p>
<p>London The leader of the French delegation told reporters this afternoon that the fate of the three-nation agreement on stable exchange rates during the meeting is now in the hands of the US government. The content is to stipulate the highest and lowest limits of the exchange rate between the US and the UK, with the understanding that France will maintain the gold standard. According to today, the Economic Conference has not convened a general assembly, and the deliberations of the Monetary and Economic Committees are purely routine matters to prepare for the start of work on Monday. Therefore, the attention of the representatives is focused on the negotiations on the "close stability" of the currencies of the three countries. The atmosphere at the meeting is even more optimistic. Today, US Secretary of State Hull has broadcast to his country, saying that the meeting will not fail, and advising the people to trust its success, and saying that the original intention of his speech the other day was to provide the people with exploration (National News Agency dispatch on the 16th).</p>
<p>London The US and France previously competed for a seat as Chairman of the Monetary Committee, almost causing a major pause in the committee. It is heard that the reason for the competition was that the US government did not approve of the US-British pound stabilization law agreed yesterday. US Secretary of State Hull is now eagerly awaiting instructions from the US government on this matter. France firmly advocates that the stabilization is very important, saying that without this, the Monetary Committee cannot continue to work (Reuters dispatch on the 16th).</p>
