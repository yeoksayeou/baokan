<p>時評</p>
<h3>冀北匪氛之嚴重性都</h3>
<p>華北戰區。自開始接收以迄今日。爲期已逾匝月。經若干回之留難波折。大體上似可告一段落。而按諸實際。長城沿線之五大口。固猶在胡騎蹂躪之下。其餘次要之數十口。亦尙多敵軍盤踞其間。都山興隆。旣以凸出關外。拒予交還。臨榆縣城。復以毘接僞境。迫令遷治。即就已接收之各縣言。亦寗能擺脫木屐兒之覊絆。密雲屯兵。不撤反增。遵化機塲。興築方殷。僞軍恣肆于玉田。漢奸活躍于唐山。他如灤陽遷安建昌營石匣等處。無在不見驕卒之橫行。行政設施。無一事不遭日人之干涉。蓋所謂交還云者。衹是一種名義上之酬答。「政由寗氏。祭則寡人。」要是日方所認爲最大之讓步已。</p>
<p>然而情勢惡劣。猶不止此。最近灤東各縣。匪氛日熾。羣處嘯聚。公然勒索。沿口一帶。尤號猖獗。輕重機槍。迫擊野砲。所稱爲新式戰鬥器者。無不備具。以此肆其掠奪。宜成不制之勢。夫以久淪敵手之戰區。忽來如許充斥之匪軍。以山林跳梁之小醜。擁有若斯精良之武器。果爲出於何方之供億支持乎。幕後有人。呼之欲出。稍一凝想。不難恍然。各縣長身臨邊地。動遭挾持尸居餘氣。本無活力。戟指可仆。寗待摧隳。董天華倉皇逃津。張蓋臣突圍出走固吾人意計中應有之現象也。而日人通信社。且於此時。大事宣傳。助匪張目。不曰秦島秩序已陷混亂。即曰唐山突遭土匪襲擊。不曰榆關日警已趕往保護。即曰宋迺乾方就商於日軍司令。其欲造成恐怖之事實。以爲不逞之藉口者。要不難於其已往之行動卜得之。未來華北之危機。殆又在嚴密醞酿中矣。</p>
<p>原夫茲回日人所以重演挑釁之意味者。非必由於軍事上之返循故徑。儘可視爲外交上之突來威脅。蓋自塘沽恊定簽字以後。彼方軍人於蹡躇滿志之餘。方謂我國必且全部屈服。俯首帖耳以聽從彼方之意旨。亦遂欲藉此收束軍事。宣告全盤勝算之屬於。彼乃忽聞宋子文在美成立棉麥借欵。在國聯促成技術合作。頓令彼輩疑駭之目光中。織成暴怒之兇燄。一月來謀所以破壞技術合作者。亦旣極盡其恐嚇之能事矣。自羅文幹有出巡新疆汪院長自兼外長之議。彼方宣傳家竟又怦然心動。竭力從事於我國轉換外交政策之鼓吹。同時復高唱籌備宋子文過日之歡迎。意在誘致我國。就其牢籠。迨夫宋氏過日。並不登陸。一切迹象。且歸渺影。此實予彼方以重大之失望。因失望而懷疑慮。復因疑慮而施威脅。拔劍張弩。要盟是索。封豕。長蛇何所底此。凡此揣想所及。宜非盡屬誣妄者歟。</p>
<p>明乎日人狡圖所在。我國政府當局。要有不能不急謀應付者。如何運用外交手段。以解除當前之糾紛。如何統籌抵抗策畫。以保障華北之安全。皆應集合羣體思考所得。劍及屨及而赴之。若猶復以泄沓之故態。爲因循之坐誤。則前轍之覆可尋。噬臍之禍何及。華北一帶之刦餘黎民。瘡痍未復。隠痛猶烈。忍令再陷溺于莫測之深淵乎。</p>

<h3>日陸軍省統制東省資源</h3>

<h3>日圖安定政局</h3>
<p>黨政合作重精神不尙形式　　政友會國策逐漸求其實現</p>
<p>（東京）鈴木政友會總裁昨日與齋藤首相會見結果、雙方均表示滿意、齋藤首相在閣議報告其會談經過、各閣員亦承首相之意見、向來反對妥恊之軍部、因政友會之態度甚消極、荒木陸相亦表示反對、若長此以進、政府與政黨之合作、或可以順利進行、蓋爲軍財兩閥均認爲目前之勢、十分不利於兩閥之爭所致、（三十日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）政府决定方針、由政府各機關逐步實現政友會提出之國策、但政府方面意見不如政友會、並無恊定各項國策之意、唯欲以舉國一致之精神、打開非常時局之難關、今後亦以政友會政策爲參考、作成國策、並不與政友會爲任何形式的恊定、蓋如政府與政友會爲恊定、則不得不先得民政黨之同意、而民政政友各有立場不同之政策恐將惹起複雜問題、現在齋藤鈴木若槻三人之精神的合作已成立、政局可謂安定、政府即將開始編製明年度預算、（三十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>荒木陸相激勵齋藤</h3>
<p>希望確立國策</p>
<p>充實對外力量</p>
<p>（東京）荒木陸相昨日於定例閣議後、會見齋藤首相、繼續前次關於内政外交問題、尤其關於世界經濟會議决裂後之美國對日政策、及某某國之對日積極計畫設施等、以軍部所得之情報爲基礎、加以說明後、並謂半年以後、日本之對外關係或遇一大危機、亦未可知、望政府更加努力、確立對策、實刻不容緩之圖、要求首相之奮起、同時關於政友會之五大政策問題、交換意見、（三十日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）齋藤首相於昨日閣議後、特與荒木陸相會談一小時、報告三黨首（鈴木·若櫬及安達）會談經過、及鈴木總裁所提出之國策内容、荒木對齋藤表示軍部亦甚滿意、並勉勵齋藤加一番努力、爲國效勞、荒木陸相此種意見、甚堪注意、原來軍部反對政黨及其後台老板之財閥尤烈、當齋藤與高橋商請鈴木入閣之時、荒木面諫齋藤勿屈服於政黨、雖一戰亦在所不辭、明倫會總裁田中國重大將亦面勸齋藤勿與政黨合作、如政黨敢搗亂、則願爲政府後盾、在此環境之中、政友會與政府之合作、似難得到美滿結果、不料軍財兩部均表示滿意、日政界空氣之轉移、蓋爲增加其對外抗爭之力量、荒木陸相所發表之左記談話、甚値中外人之注意、鈴木總裁所提出之政策雖未讀過、但三黨首與齋藤之會見、是不可容疑之事實、結果如何尙難預測、政局之趨向已經過新階叚、無論何人在此時局更加切迫之秋、應有相當之覺悟、放棄一切之私權、試看首相之决心、亦可以明白全體閣員、以誠懇之熱情奔走國事、在三個月總有相當成績可觀、（三十日華聯電）</p>
<h3>政黨聯繫機運未熟</h3>
<p>（東京）政友會昨向民政黨及國民同盟提示政策大綱、（與曾向政府提示者同）目的在欲造成政黨聯繫之機運、惟民政黨對於此次之事、並不重視、如　田幹事長聲稱、縱令政友會提議設置共同政務調查機關、我黨决不承諾、是民政黨之大勢有不能遽從政友會勸誘之實情、故政友方面雖向之商洽、其實現性甚少、其實民政黨之内部並非無聯繫論者、且有與政友會同一主張者、屢次會見之事實、一入今秋政治節、有以急速度釀成機運之可能、惟一面國民同盟係以統制經濟爲根本方針、故其政策與政友會不同、已聲稱不能贊成、昨日政友代表會見安達總裁時、曾附言政友會預想他日有不能不反對政府時請民政黨及國民同盟諒解、此言確有深長之意義（三十日電通電）</p>
<h3>杉村不日來華</h3>
<p>負有重要使命</p>
<p>（東京）内田外相正式命令杉村陽太郎公使、前往中國及滿洲、但杉村公使於表面上、似未負有正式之使命、而事實上在打開對華政策、故九月十日由東京出發、先赴滿洲、次及華北·華中·華南、預定巡歷約二月半、然現適賴西曼博士由國聯來華、且宋子文返國後、中國與國聯之關係行將密切之際、與國聯關係較深之杉村公使亦於此時來華、頗堪重視、（三十日電通電）</p>
<h3>俄轉換外交策</h3>
<p>德國有以促成之</p>
<p>（巴黎）時報發表社論、評論蘇俄外交、略謂「共産制度遭遇不可解决之困難、因困窮之故、對於農民不能不有所讓步、蘇俄所需要者、首爲和平及安全、次爲財政及經濟上之援助、因是乃與波羅的海沿岸各國波蘭·法國·陸續締結互不侵犯條約、對於意大利亦有同樣條約之商訂、其與波蘭彼此極爲信賴、若干人以爲俄波之間、必可成持久之諒解、凡此情形、大部分出於德國之賜、蓋蘇俄外交之所以忽然轉變者、德國政策上之錯誤實有以促之、」云云（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日方傳蘇俄增兵邊境</h3>
<p>（東京）據日軍部接到情報、蘇俄最近在俄「滿」國境方面集中大軍之係確事實其兵力達日本全國軍隊一半以上、空軍有重轟炸機及其他優秀飛機共三百餘架、據日方觀察、蘇俄因與西方隣接國波蘭等訂立不侵犯條約、且因法德匈等歐洲各國之政治關係、西部國境可保安全、乃移其軍隊於東部國境、牽制中東路交涉之糾紛、及中日停止恊定後之遠東空氣、日軍當局對於俄方軍隊之行動、以重大决意注目中、（三十日日聯電）</p>

<h3>美政府修改金禁令</h3>
<p>准許新礦金輸往國外</p>
<p>民間存金歸財部統制</p>
<p>海德公園今日羅斯福總統以行政命令修改禁金令、准礦中新産黃金、在財部嚴格監督之下運輸出口、同時又將全國民間存金、悉置於財部所得稅局統制監督之下、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>海德公園羅斯福總統今日廢除一部份黃金出品之禁令、准財政部接、受儲備銀行轉來委託代售之美國新礦金、又諭令存有金幣金條及金券者、於兩星期内報告其所有之數、及通幣何以不能、代用之理由、此禁令之撤銷、使美國礦公司有獲取較高價格之機會、美國黃金將、儘先售與外國購戶、次乃售與領有執、照在美術、工業或職業用金之人、其售價由財政部於考慮運費保險費等後决定之、須與世界公開金市塲所可有之善價相等、取締窖藏條例、將許財政部對於對外、貿易用金者及向國内銀行提取現金者發給印照、惟金額在一百元以下者除外、任何人或任何團體除儲備銀行外、如收用現金必須領照、三十天後任何人不許藏置金幣金條或金券、違則處罰萬元、及十年監禁、此項弛禁之命令、今日在總統方由白宮乘汽車出外時倐然宣佈、此訊傳出後、紐約證券交易所金礦股票市價驟起、國内金股漲起十五元、而達超過三百元之新紀錄、餘亦漲起一元至三元、財政部預計美國金礦業因此結果每年可多獲利一千五百餘萬元、其營業之復形活動、自在意中、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>政府操黃金管理權據夏令白宮聲稱此令並非准許黃金自由流通、亦不致影響政府存金、照命令規定礦主欲將新産黃金運銷國外、須呈報財部、財部審察情形認爲可以准許出口後、乃由聯邦儲備銀行代爲運銷國外、而將所得欵、除去運費保險費等歸還礦主、故財部對於新産黃金、不僅仍保留以每盎斯二十元六角七分官價收買之權、且有准否出口之權、礦主方面則如欲售金國外、不僅須託政府代銷、即於所銷數額亦不能自行决定、再此令並不准許設立自由買賣市塲、亦不减削政府管理黃金之權、</p>
<p>用意在扶助金礦業政府此令用意、固在扶助金礦業、因目前國外金價、比美國官價每盎斯約高九元、故該業運動准許新産黃金出口業已月餘、按該業意見現分兩派有所謂全國委員會者、主張在紐約設立自由買賣市塲、另有美國礦業大會一派、雖信自由市塲有益於該業、但認不若准許新産黃金出口、較能接近於政府之貨幣與復興計劃、美總統頒發此令前、曾　訽兩派意見、而採用准許出口辦法、</p>
<p>抵制英国貨幣政策但據著名銀行家意見、此令作用尙不僅欲鼓勵金礦業、蓋自七月初以來、歐洲迭向美國提取巨額黃金、即在八月五日爲止一星期内、紐約儲備銀行運往法國之黃金、所値在四千一百萬元以上、即運往㨗克者所値亦在六百萬元以上、㨗克斯拉夫能有如許業曾標識之黃金存在美國、誠令銀行家大惑不解、即法國存在紐約而業經標識之黃金、數亦無多、此中原因、顯似英國有意援助歐陸金本位國之貨幣、蓋英國自設置平準匯兌基金後、即有巨額標識之黃金存在紐約也、此項運出國外之數、官廳雖不發表、但聞近日至少有一萬四千萬元輸出、而輸入則甚微、政府之准新産黃金出口、即欲代替此種黃金之流出、蓋一舉而兩善備焉、</p>
<p>金製品出口受限制今日行政命令内雖有一條准許黃金製造物品出口、但復頒第二令、將此種出口亦置於政府嚴格管理之下、規定財部所得稅局有監督通國私人存金全權例如金匠向政府購置黃金數目與製造金飾金器數目等、均須按時呈報所得稅局而受其檢查、所得稅局人員並能阻止私人所藏金幣金條在國内運輸或運往國外、故民間窖金者亦將受政府嚴格之監督、</p>
<p>認有膨脹通貨效能至此令影響今日尙無甚表見、一般從事證劵交易者顯似認其有膨脹通貨效能、故今日證劵市况堅定、而價格上漲、此外評論者則見仁見智、人各不同、膨脹通貨派聲稱有膨脹效能、其餘則認此說毫無根據、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>美復興輪軸增速轉動</h3>
<p>政府儲巨欵供應用</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統國家復興之大機軸、現正增速運動、以期成就其對於美國農工業注入動力之工作、當此時期、美當局儲有億兆美元以供應用、查費用最大者爲三十萬元之公共工程程序、而費用最小者爲國家復興案、此案現僅從財政部自七月起所發之臨時緊急經費二萬零五百萬元中撥用二十五萬耳、財政部每日儲有一萬萬元以上之現欵、以便應付全國各處復興運動之費用及尋常行政費、截至目前止、公共工程行政處共已支出十二萬萬元、用於建設事項、（廿九路透）</p>
<h3>勸導購買運動</h3>
<p>福特拒絶遵行業規</p>
<p>行政督辦特致警告</p>
<p>（華盛頓）復興程序中之最新一幕、爲大規模的勸人目前購買之運動、據若干人意見、目前最大之努力如不能成功、則復興程序尙須有如膨脹政策等之補助計畫、復興案執行員約翰遜將軍所擬辦法、有購戶可購進値二十萬萬元貨物一節、今失業人之復得工作者、據約翰遜將軍估計爲二百萬人、雖全國工資已因此每星期增三千萬元、而復興之全功須二三月後始可告成、但今日復得工作者之人數、遠在估計之下、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日汽車大王福特拒絶遵行政府昨日批准之汽車業規、藉口所給工資更優於業規所訂數目、欲避免政府之監督與統制、按反抗復興計劃者、福特猶爲第一人、故消息傳至華盛頓、人人震動、國實業復興行政督辦强森立向福特警告、曉以衆努難犯、並表示福特苟不迅速悔悟、渠將列福特公司與其附屬各公司於黑色名單内、立即通令全國政府採購機關勿購其出品、今日舉行復興行政紀念、此間參加游行者在一萬人以上、其中海陸軍人爲數不少、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>顧馨一談救濟麵粉狂跌</h3>
<p>美麥如何出售</p>
<p>關係最爲重要</p>
<p>上週行政院會議、汪院長提議調查麥産情形、以資救濟、現在各部會曁江蘇省政府京滬兩市主管局均在切實調查中、新聲社記者以事關農民經濟、政府旣有决心調節麥産、滬市爲粉廠總樞、銷麥甚鉅、其所關係尤大、究竟本年麥收若干、各粉廠製粉及需用小麥各若干、現狀如何、有何救濟辦法、當往訪機製麵粉廠業同業公會主席委員顧馨一氏、據談如下、</p>
<h3>麥産統計</h3>
<p>據云、本國麥産、歲有幾何素乏統計、無所根據、本年麥收、合蘇皖浙三省計之、約有一千五百萬擔、蘇産爲多、佔總額百分之七五、皖浙共占百分之三五、至本市粉廠存麥約三百萬擔、内以洋麥爲多數、約有二百萬擔、本麥一百萬擔、市上存麥亦有六十萬擔、則以本麥居多、約有四十五萬擔、洋麥僅十五萬擔而已、近來逐日到麥、仍有四五萬擔、以江北麥爲無錫多、方面、廠存三十萬擔、市存四十萬擔逐日到麥、亦有五千擔之數、本年洋麥進口、（一至七月）以二三月爲最旺、迄今約有七百五十萬擔、而以澳麥居多數、約占十成之八、其餘美坎阿根廷各廠約占二成、粉廠用麥、視其出粉力量之大小而異其需要、查上海各廠、每日出粉約十二萬包、用麥約六萬擔、姑以全年開車三百天計之、則每年需麥一千八百萬擔、再以洋回本大計、則需洋麥七百二十萬擔、本麥一千零八十萬擔、至上海以外之各廠、以無錫爲最多、日出粉約三百包、需麥約一萬五千擔、常鎭等六處、計有九廠、日可出粉三萬包、用麥約一萬五千擔、故合江蘇全省計之、每日可出粉十八萬包、需麥約九百擔也、附表、（以千包千擔爲單位）</p>

<p>（註）粉以每包四十九磅爲單位、麥以每百什爲單位、所列之數外大都估計之數、</p>
<p>查本市存粉三百萬包中、内計二號粉二百萬包、三號粉四十萬包、四號粉六十萬包</p>
<h3>變遷經過</h3>
<p>小麥在本年春間、每担約五元左右、新麥標準在二月份開拍時、亦在四元六七角、但至八月份最小曾至三元五角三分、米價在春間亦有二元七八角、及新麥登塲、爲二元四五角、八月份竟至二元一角八分、此中變遷趨過、以及麥之跌價原因、其大致固有如日前申報經濟專刋所云、但究以粉銷不振之原因爲多、蓋麥之銷路爲粉、粉如積滯不銷、麥之去路自絶、查上海本廠粉之銷塲、向以北方爲大宗、如北平天津東三省一帶、俱爲本廠粉之最大銷地乃自東北淪陷、市塲卽爲日本粉廠所獨占、本廠粉遭其排斥、旣而日粉又侵入平津、蘇俄繼起、均持其國家爲後盾、但各傾銷、不計成本、華商粉廠、類皆商人集資經營、財力薄弱、何能與日俄之有奥援者較、於是上海粉廠之北方銷路、日見式微、存粉則日厚、出粉則日减、麥之銷費更不言而知其减少矣、再則米價不振糧價均小、各種粗糧又屬豐收、産麥各區復多土磨之粉、機粉之銷售乃更受影響矣比來上海本廠粉銷路、外埠袛銷三萬餘包、本市及四鄉所銷約二萬餘包、合計袛及每日出粉之半數乃致日有積存、而有三百餘萬包之鉅、來日方長、若不亟圖補救、後患將不堪設想矣、</p>
<h3>救濟之方</h3>
<p>麥爲粉之原料、粉之銷路暢、則麥之需用廣、故救粉止所以救麥、救粉之道、㈠此次所借之美麥、如何出售、實爲至大至艱之問題、但最　（甲）絶對不可售於洋商、否則無異傅虎以翼而　敵以糧也、（乙）應由棉麥辦事處、會同麵粉廠同業公會、雜糧公會、以　妥善之辦法、將美麥分售於華商大小各廠、㈡進口麵粉業已征稅、而日俄洋粉仍不絶而來、可見以低於成本之價、對華傾銷、應由政府早日　以傾銷稅、㈢内地官廳對於小麥、征收遇多、應請酌量减免、以利外銷、㈣市産區農民以金融之接濟、使不致爲急於求售、而陷麥市於嚴重的供遇於求之地步、更促市價之下落、致農民之損失更大也、此則深　政府當局早日有以救濟云云、</p>
<h3>英美工湖變化</h3>
<p>工人意見紛歧</p>
<p>雙方發生誤會</p>
<p>紛擾現暫平息</p>
<p>大公社云、浦東英美烟公司新老兩廠怠工風潮、迄未解决、昨日上午、有新廠印花間工人一千餘名、秘密集議、主張復工、並齊赴工會提出責問、以致發生嚴重紛擾、公安局聞悉、當派大批警士到塲彈壓、幸未發生事故、勞資糾紛問題、市府已定期仲裁、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>主張復工浦東陸家宅英美烟公司第二廠印花間工人一千餘名、其平常待遇、向較各間工人爲優、自新老兩廠宣佈總怠工後、迄今仍無解决希望、當由新廠印花間工人潘全榮等數人、主張决定明日（今日）起一律復工、以致引起其他工人憤慨、認爲破壞團結、當派員向工會報告、工會得悉後、立卽派員傳潘全榮到會查詢、並以外面工人聚集甚衆、恐發生意外、當勸該潘全榮在會稍待、致引起印花間工人之誤會、</p>
<p>集衆責問新廠印花間工人千餘名、誤會潘全榮係被工會扣留、當卽集合工人數百名齊赴賴義渡五區捲烟工會内提出責問、其他各間工人聞訉、則誤會印花間工人聚衆搶奪工會、當亦立卽聚集千餘人、至工會四週保護、一時兩方工人對峙、形勢殊爲險惡、</p>
<p>頭目集議五區捲烟工會全體理監事鑒兩方工人發生誤會、恐肇事端、當卽召集新廠印花間頭目到會問話、結果衆頭目均云該潘全榮確有召集印花間工人秘密會議、企圖破壞怠工、鉅此時在門外工人數十名、忽鳴警笛、意圖衝入工會</p>

<p>（濟南通信）本省參加今年全國運動會、原擬選拔男女田徑全能選手、及各項球類代表隊、並已建築游泳池、預備加送游泳選手、不圖黃河爲害、魯西悉成澤國、省府及地方救災不遑、對全運預選决縮小範圍舉行、經連日敎廳與全運預選籌委會競賽股長尙樹梅磋商、已决定全運預選會、自九月十五日起十七日止只開三天、選拔男女田徑全能選手、不選拔球隊、各校有比賽游泳者、亦可比賽惟不選送選手、</p>

<p>羅泊杯國際雙打網球初賽、中華對葡萄牙、於昨日下午四時半在中華會舉行、中華因江道章之衰老、使邱飛海獨木難支、結果雖以三比一淘汰葡萄牙、但表演殊屬平庸、前途希望暗淡、未可樂觀、成績如下、</p>

<p>前兩盤中華之勝、尙見容易、然江道章許多不可願諒之失誤、使比賽興趣大减、第二盤中華先以三比一佔先、以後互相勝負、形勢平均、中華幸先打根底、得以六比四勝、第三盤江之失誤愈多、葡選手得以七比五勝、邱江於黑暗中再以六比一勝第四盤、</p>

<p>七月五日（星期三）續昨</p>
<p>一二兩盤中、雖相差不多、克勞福主持局面、此比賽中、錯誤之多、更甚於前塲、例如第一盤中、佐藤二比二成平手、克勞福四次極易攔網、皆失誤、佐藤四比三勝對方發球、克勞福藉二次觸帶球、及佐藤球運不濟之發球雙誤、反以五比三佔先、而六比三得勝、第二盤中各三後、佐藤雖較前進步、克仍以六比四得勝、佐藤球運、殊屬不濟、在四比五時、只須二分、卽成五比五、竟二次</p>
<p>觸網、克勞福乘機上進、其錯誤有不可原諒者、第三盤佐藤大爲生色、連勝五局、克勞福欲上前近　、皆被閃過、克勞福發球、零丨三十、似乎佐藤將勝一光盤、但爲克奪六七兩局以去、其次克之發球局、錯誤不可計、一分亦未得、</p>
<p>第四盤最先之五局、發球者皆敗、比賽漸漸起色、雙方好球劣球互見、四比四時、佐藤發球、接戰更烈、此起彼仆、佐藤發球雙誤、克勞福佔先一分、但又觸網、繼以出界、佐藤又佔先一分、但將其最容易之一記反手壓殺、送入網内、佐藤面現失望、克勞福則正駭極而呼、於是克勞福一抽達底線、破此重要之發球局、頓以五比四居優勢、再攫得其次、</p>
<p>克勞福應得勝利、能在緊要時期中、堅定不亂來球不失、去球則能置之要地、第三盤陷於惡境、第四盤受其影響、因失誤極易之球、漸現不耐煩、佐藤之錯誤亦如是、發球雙誤、送球進網、二次容易之壓球失誤、在第四盤中、冒險近網、加緊速度、殊令人驚、此塲皆重力擊球、收塲克較佐遜色、</p>

<h3>楊恒春怎樣了？</h3>
<p>— 程小靑</p>
<p>楊恒春是誰？他是個無名小卒；他的姓名又祗在報紙上曇花一現，自然不會在人們的意識中留什麽印象。現在我來摘錄八月六日各報上的一節短新聞，作爲一種介紹：</p>
<p>昨晨城内邑廟中發生一白晝路刦案······事主吳馬氏大呼捕盜，當被盜匪開槍擊傷左脚。······時有糧廳路信義齋鳥店夥友山東人楊恒春，聞聲追捕，將一盜抱住，亦爲另一盜開槍轟擊，彈中楊恒春要害，性命垂危，業已送入同仁醫院。······</p>
<p>楊恒春怎樣了？他死了沒有？或是他的槍傷幸而已經治好？他還在醫院裏面麽？他的近况怎樣？我天天紀念着，可是報紙上始終沒有後文！他的姓名竟不曾再度在報紙上披露過！</p>
<p>在我的愚見，楊恒春的仗義鋤惡的舉動，是有重大意義的。楊君和被刦的吳馬氏，本來素不相識。在一般人看來，吳馬氏的遭匪攔刦，和楊君原　毫不相干。其實從社會的意識立論，社會的安寗。每一個市民都是有維護責任的丨丨換一句說，每一個市民，都應負著　惡鋤暴，以維持社會秩序的責任；猶之每一個國民，對於國家的存亡安危，都有同仇敵愾，捍衛國家的天職。最不幸的，當案發的時候，别的市民都顧慮着小我的利害，放棄了應盡的義務而袖手旁觀。袛有楊君一個人，憑着齊魯俠士的遺風，表現出這種民族生存所依託的義勇精神！所以我認爲在這個民族精神暗淡消沉的當兒，陽君的舉動，無論在社會方面，和國家民族方面，都有重大的意義，而値得表揚和提倡。</p>
<p>我們記得對於一個因公殉職的警士，地方長官會親臨弔祭；對於一個因公犧牲的救火員，地方公團也會追悼撫恤。但楊君的義勇的舉動，其價値和意識，更出於因公殉職的公務員之上。他的生死，都有値得注意的必要。但怎麽賢明的地方長官，和熱心的社會公團，竟這樣子熟視無覩地默默無所表示？還有那些注意社會新聞的大主筆大記者，在奮筆記述那「玉體橫陳」，「一絲不掛」一類的所謂社會新聞之餘，怎麽也不肯分些兒餘墨，對於這可敬可愛的俠士，略略地加以調查和記述？我敢說這種事，才是眞正的社會新聞！這種事如果發生在歐美或島鄰，我相信那大號的標題，一定會佔據報紙的重要篇幅了。</p>
<p>未了，我憑着十二萬分的誠意，把本文標題的問句，敬獻於賢明的長官，指導輿論的記者，社會的領袖，地方的公團，和一般有健全理智的男女市民之前：</p>
<p>楊恒春怎樣了？</p>
<h3>是非</h3>
<p>— 胡麗文</p>
<p>兩個人爭一樣東西，總有個「是」「非」；不是甲方是「是」，便是乙方是「是」，不是甲方是「非」，便是乙方是「非」，决沒有全是「是」，或者全是「非」的的。不過相爭的人，斷不肯說出自己的「非」來：總是公說公有理，婆說婆有理，說得天花亂墜，把那些調解的人，弄得頭腦昏昏，究不知誰是「是」，誰是「非」？雖有調停的好意，却沒有分别「是」「非」的眼光，結果，只好袖手旁觀，聽他們去各「是」其「是」，各「非」其「非」了。</p>
<p>法佔九島後。我國提出抗議，日本也提出抗議，究竟孰「是」孰「非」？本來只要在國史上一查，便會分别出來的；但可惜中國人太不管事了，自己的東西，是什麽一個樣子，還弄不明白，即使中國的抗議不「非」全「是」，日本的抗議似「是」而「非」，而一般掛着公理招牌的大人物，也只好裝痴作呆，不管「是」「非」；法國因此也認日本爲「是」，向其敷衍，認中國爲「非」，掉頭不顧了。</p>
<p>唉！今日之世界，强者爲「是」，弱者爲「非」。皆哉斯言！旨哉斯言！</p>

<h3>弄堂閒話</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>在進過晚膳之後，閒立戶外，覺暑氣漸消，一陣陣的凉風吹上衣襟，自然感到一種舒適。這時，左右隣舍，男男女女的人們，都排列着在弄堂裏納凉。在這露天的集團中，往往會聽得到富於描寫而含有趣味的談話。</p>
<p>張家嫂嫂發言道：隔壁的玲弟，怎麽好久沒有瞧見了。想來，伊是回到婆家去咧。</p>
<p>李家嫂嫂道：你不曉得嗎？伊在上月裏，已經正式嫁了人了，聽說是做續絃，那丈夫年紀三十多歲，人品還好，家况也過得去。最可笑的，伊的阿婆，前幾天，還從松江寄來一封信，要伊回去。說家中人手少，一切事務，都待媳婦回來料理。不料伊早已做了他家的媳婦了：這位婆太太，眞還蒙在鼓裏呢。　　張家嫂嫂現着詫異色道：眞笑話，像玲弟這種人，也會變心嫁人，看伊並沒有騷形怪狀的樣子，倒會自由起來，正所謂『會捉老鼠貓弗呌。』</p>
<p>李家嫂嫂又道：這也怪不得伊，你想伊是年紀輕輕的人，正好似花的一朶。伊做新娘子的時候，還不過十八歲，那時伊的丈夫已害了癆怯症，就過門做親，算是冲喜。那知祗有兩個月，伊丈夫竟一命嗚呼。伊做孤　到今，忽忽六七年，聽說還是個「大小姐呢。在現在的時勢，宋節也沒有什麽道理。伊會放出眼光，揀個男人嫁給他，做人重新做起，這也是伊的幸運了。</p>
<p>張家嫂嫂聽了這話，臉上好像有些紅了，好久說不出話來。原來伊也是位『矢志柏舟』的寡婦！</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>這時，王先生聽着微笑。李家嫂嫂　轉話鋒，問道：你們嫂嫂的毛病，今天好些嗎？我正在掛念着咧。</p>
<p>王先生道：謝謝你，内人的病，昨天請了醫生，服藥之後，肚腹已見輕鬆些。而且放了三次的屁，第一次，在昨晚九點四十分。第二次，半夜一點鐘。第三次，在天亮的時候。放屁是氣機流通之象；所以我聽了屁聲一響，心中爲之一安，總之伊的病，都由肝氣鬱結而起。說來說去，總是我們那位老太太脾氣太壞，平常歡喜多說多話，不管做媳婦的動氣不動氣，因此煩惱終難免。我們老太太，還有一件討厭的事。每到睡眠的時候，總是咳嗽吐痰，氣喘聲與嘆氣聲，不斷的鬧着，伊老人家是睡在隔壁房裏的，累得人家沒有安安穩穩的睡覺，你想有病的人，還能睡得熟嗎？這眞是氣數咧。</p>
<p>王先生又說了聲再會，到裏邊去了　　李家嫂嫂嘆道：唉···老太太喘氣，不如少奶奶撒屁。『人老珠黃不値錢』，還有什麽話頭。</p>

<p>第十四回　授室多艱徘徊憂後顧　邀朋小聚靦覥記前塵</p>
<p>趙自强笑道：那裏有這樣幾句話，全是你謅的。殷得仁倒不和他辯論，只拍他的膀肩，笑道：趕快去籌辦喜事罷。春暖花香這也就到了日子了。我是除了義金之外，（註；同營人有婚喪事，由師旅長以下出金爲賀，曰集義。金額由數分以至數元。）還得送你一個厚厚的分子，哈哈！趙自强見他不肯說什麽，就也只好走下樓來。却在對面墻上，看到他們這一連，預備檢閱委員看的標語，乃是匃奴未滅，，何以家爲？趙自强想着，只瞧這個，殷得仁的志趣可知了。將關殷兩位的事情一看，這當軍人的人，娶親實在沒意思。現在這年頭，槍口不對外也要對内，在西苑這地方，知道能夠駐防多久？一個當連長的人，把家眷帶了到處跑，這是辦不到的事，只好把媳婦扔在家裏了。年輕輕的媳婦，仍在家裏，這個年頭兒，能夠不出什麽毛病嗎？趙自强自己出了難題自己來想，不由得心裏冷了大半截。他只管對着墻上那八個字的標語，呆呆的站着。有人在身邊呌了一聲趙連長。回頭看時，却是這連的司務長站在這裏。便問道：你們這一連，越發的佈置週到了，標語都寫得這樣整齊，誰寫的？司務長道：是我寫的，其實這八個字也就是我們殷連長自己，瞧着對勁。趙自强也明白他的話了，聳着肩膀微微一笑。司務長道：趙連長，幾時，我得喝你一杯喜酒吧？趙自强笑道：你倒也知道這件事，幸而這還不算壞事，要算壞事，我可秘密不了啦。他笑着走回了連部自己一個人悶悶的想着，娶親這件事能辦不能辦，到現在眞應該考量一下子了。（一七四）</p>

<h3>女店員</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>朱惜儂屢次看見小報上，有許多捧女店員的文章，伊兀自羨慕得不得了。不是說長樂公司的派克（女店員的綽號）怎樣地美，便是說榮光公司的襪子皇后怎樣地媚。或者說華强公司的奶包西施怎樣地嬌，愛利公司的絹頭美人怎樣地姸···，這無是使伊感到非常艷羨，同時又非常的懊喪，因爲伊也曾在淸瑩的鏡子裏照過自己的臉龐，細細地看過，是長得好好地，極爲豐滿，雖然不能說是圓姿替月，也可說是杏臉生春，單就那兩個嫩頰，自覺也有吹彈得破的勝槪；再說那兩個引人入勝的梨渦，更有萬金不易的可貴，那顆小小的嘴說撅也不撅，說平也不平的長在那裏，再加上一些姸　的口紅，異姓朋友見了，有那個不來拜到石榴裙下······要是我時運不來，所以碰不到這樣好的機會，假使一旦有這麽一個各大公司招請女店員的廣告，去應試起來，定能占到最後的勝利的······這樣片段的思想，常在伊的腦海中縈繞看。</p>
<p>本公司現在需要女店員十人，支配在各部服務，酬報從豐，如果願意前來服務者，自×月×日起，至×月×日止，下午一時至三時，駕臨花市路三二三號綺麗公司女店員登記處接洽可也。綺麗股份有限公司啟</p>
<p>×日的樂報的本市新聞分類廣告欄内，刋載着這麽一則廣告，前面還排列着木戳的大字：請女店員，這是一個多麽驚人的消息啊！尤其是我們的朱惜儂，伊在那天就看見這麽一段投人心懷的好消息，當然是感到萬分的愉快。</p>
<p>這是丨個顯明的事實，登了報紙廣告招請人員，比拿了糖果引螞蟻還要來得多，這次綺麗公司還說明了下午一時至三時，却在上午九時，就有一位畫着雨道長眉，身材瘦瘦的中年婦人來應試，終於爲了時間未到，退了出來。</p>
<p>他們用過了午飯，在女店員登記處，安排了三字式的三條長檯，上面放上了紙墨筆硯，在恭候着女店員的光臨應試，那時候，不過衹有一點三十八分吧！兩位差不多長的玄衣白鞋的少女，相偕進來，他們管理登記的職員，連忙立起招呼，請伊們分别坐下，各個塡寫一張登記表，可是接二連三的光臨，幾位職員却不夠支配，在許多人之中，當然姸的也有，媸的也有，其間有一對姊妹花，說是長樂公司做過的，一位穿印花綢長衣的在中外藥房做過的，一位穿條子紡長衣的，是在×處區公所做過的，一位學生裝束的，在××中學敎過書的，做過事情而有經騐的，却有不少，而没有做過事情的人，倒也很多很多，最可笑的是一老一小，老的大概有四十多歲，而小的不過十四歲，陪伊來的那位形似父親的老者說：伊是十六歲。　　朱惜儂也就在那時候來應試，登記處已經有好多的人在執筆塡寫了，職員們招呼伊暫時請等一等，這眞是一件使人感到很有興趣的事情，伊的一副宜嗔宜喜的春風面，簡直可以壓到來應試的羣芳，他們的職員，大家在竊竊私議，此人大槪可以中選了，等到一位穿淡藍黑花的塡好之後，他們連忙來招呼伊去塡寫，果然，伊執着自己帶來的自來水筆，很流利的寫下去，一些也沒有停留，簡直使職員們都看呆了，伊旁邊的一位，却和他成了反比例，執住了筆一個字也寫不下去，一星期後，某小報上，有個很大的標題：綺麗公司王后朱惜儂······，以後似乎不必再看下去了。</p>

<h3>國貨事業與安全設備</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>工商管理恊會，前天請一位富有工廠管理經騐的興德女士Ｅ·Ｍ·Ｈｉｎｄｅｒ講演，興德女士，是最注意工廠安全問題的。她所說的：都是國貨工廠最容易犯着的毛病，實在是國貨工廠的生死問題。興德女士提出下面幾個問題。</p>
<p>第一是工廠等了工人上工以後，便把出入大門緊緊關閉，甚至用了封條封住，不許任何一個人可以進出。</p>
<p>第二是工廠出入門口，堆積了許多貨物雜件，使往來的人，感到許多困難。</p>
<p>第三是建築物，太因陋就簡，或破壞不堪。</p>
<p>第四是容易肇禍之危險物品，任意堆置。</p>
<p>第五消防器具，不能設置齊備。</p>
<p>這許多情形，大多數工廠還不能注意改良，以致發生慘劇的，層見迭出。最近如正泰橡膠廠等浩刦，思之尤覺心悸。工廠安全設備，在國貨年中，實爲最切要最應注意的事件。興德女士於此事極爲熱心，日前講演時，各國貨工廠領袖多數出席參加，足見一致注意於這種問題。同時上海各工廠，又組織了工業安全恊會，專事工業安全設備之研究與改進，並刋行工業安全月刋，介紹歐美關於工業安全問題的著作，這實在是國貨年中很好的現象，吳蘊初君謂：「中國是工業落後的國家，工廠因資本短絀，大多將所有資金，咸運用在生産的設備上，這種設備的是否安全，已顧不到：更談不到特殊的安全設備。」這是何等痛心的事。許多工廠領袖，千萬不要以爲辦廠一二十年，從未經過一次災變，從未傷過一人，死過一人，認爲滿足這不過是徼天之幸、不可說安全設備已經注意或者不關安全設備的事，倘使苟且敷衍，因循下去，萬一出了亂子，犧牲之大，何可勝計。所以我希望各廠當局，要切切實實以全力注意到這個大問題，不可過於惜費，惜費往往因小失大，不可僅憑理想，理想徒然紙上談兵，我們不辦工廠便罷，辦工廠的第一要點，須在脚踏實地小小心心的往前幹去。注意到這個問題，那麽國貨事業才有希望。</p>

<p>現在單指服裝方面講，市塲上所見到的男和女，尤其是靑年男女，身上差不多每個人都有外貨，甚至於有穿全身外貨的，在我們國民義務責任上的想見，生存在今日的中國，農村破産到這樣，市面是凋敝到如此，内戰又是東息西起地拼命的戰爭，拿汗血輸向國外去！經濟破産到這種地步，難道穿外貨還算光榮嗎？體面呢？我國不原有結實的美麗的布疋嗎！再貴族化些講，正還有綢緞綾羅在着，是有超越徒有外表的外貨的光榮，再透澈些說：『穿國貨才算有眞光榮，眞體面！方才不負你國民的責任與義務呢！』</p>
<p>關於以上說的，國人們應當運用自己淸明的頭腦，淸楚地分析一下，快不要求這種利權外溢的虚榮！我下斷地說：『照這樣虚榮下去，在不久的將來，會將整個的中國民族都要虚榮到滅亡哩丨』國貨是有同樣的精美，這又何苦呢？</p>
<p>再講家用的器具，那情形與上說的就有些不同了，這是在小布爾喬亞　上，在客廳上，房間裏，總能看見一點外貨器皿，固然，你在施用自己的金錢，不過，要明瞭這不是講究設備，確無異於用　傷身！就在飲食方面，用外貨的也大有可觀，假使有誰能將一日的耗費統計出來，這筆數目一定又能令人昨舌！</p>
<p>總之，我們有我們純粹的實用底國貨，在購買力上應該要盡量的購買國貨，使中國的金錢千化萬用依舊在本國内，不使面善心惡的碧眼兒賺向外國去丨給他們取笑，舉着靑藍的萄葡酒漿狂飲，高唱勝利的成功之歌。</p>
<h3>國貨與營業員</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>前天晤見一位著名國貨工廠的經理，他說：推銷國貨，固然是目前很重要的工作，可是推銷國貨的先鋒，便是發行所的營業員。營業員得力，顧客多而貨物暢銷，營業員不得力，任你出品好，價格低，一般顧客還是望望然去之，不來睬你呀。他說我在店裏規定營業員，必具最低標準習慣六條：</p>
<p>㈠笑容可掬㈡點頭爲禮㈢具平等觀　　㈣低聲緩語㈤再會再會㈥慢去慢去　　最後他說這六條之後，我添一句道，非營業員如何？非營業圍範如何？這幾句話說得眞好。大家不要以爲老生常談，做生意的經濟都在裏頭。</p>

<h3>國貨之推銷與農村購買力之恢復</h3>
<p>— 意虹</p>
<p>東北淪陷，倐忽兩載，失土未復，何以爲國？一般熱心之同胞，雖目擊國難之深重，震感一時之緊張，愛國有心，衛國乏術。抗日固爲民族自救之唯一出路，生産事業爲國家命脈之所寄，是以發展産業，充實國力，尤爲要務。國貨工業界際此存亡絶續，經濟恐慌，民族資本，風雨飄零之會，而東南一隅，仍有蓬勃積極之象，是吾人於失望之餘，不得不引爲欣慰者也。</p>
<p>㈠農村破産之嚴重性丨自帝國主義挾其過剩生産蹂躪其理想市塲以來，農村手工業全爲摧破無餘，自足自給之經濟組織，旣根本動搖，民族工業卒因重重壓迫而無由發展。舊經濟組織旣被破壞，新基礎又未建立，際此靑黃不接之大轉變中，農村破産所引起之種種現象，自是過程中必然的階段。故吾人除努力建立民族工業，發展民族資本外，實無以臻自强之道；但有一先决條件，即如何解脫帝國主義的束縛和封建勢力的壓迫㈡國貨界之最大努力丨推銷國貨爲發展國貨之主要因子，而最大之需要尤屬推銷國貨之重要對象。吾國農民佔全人口百分之七十九，是農民之所需要者即無異全國之需要，吾人旣認淸國貨生産之主要消費者爲農民，則努力之方向，自屬鄕村而非都市。惟近年以來，農村破産，災禍頻仍，去秋又復「賤糓傷農」；一般農民本已力竭聲嘶，無以圖存，所謂購買力者，狂降直下，一瀉至最低限度，吾人於此欲推銷國貨入農村而藉以繁榮，誠爲不易之舉。投機者衹顧目前之利益，紛紛製造奢侈貨物，以期迎合都市社會之嗜好，此種畸形之發展，對於民族工業之前途，實爲害多而利少。雖然，吾人不應見環境的惡劣而悲傷，更不可爲了進行的阻撓而失望，吾人須探本窮源，敢問此路是否絶對不通？</p>
<p>㈢如何促進農村購買力丨農村購買力旣如是薄弱，但事實上内地鄕村，到處「洋貨充斥，」可見農民生活最低限度之必需品，實不能缺少，雖負債累累，猶爲勉辦。以如是枯竭疲敝之餘，豈再堪資本主義之摧殘？故内地鄕村購買力雖爲薄弱，需要固無時可减，國貨界誠能取而代之，則國貨之繁榮可期而利權外溢之事可免，是吾人現在最應切實注意者，厥爲農村市塲之如何收復。僅就鄙見所及，爰舉如下：</p>
<p>（甲）國貨品質之改進與成本之减低丨農民所需求之貨物，須俱備三種條件：價廉，物美，堅固丨三者齊備，則於推銷之進行，自有莫大之助力。</p>
<p>（乙）洋貨銷路之調查與國貨代用品之製造丨先從交通便利之鄕區入手，詳細調查其銷量及分佈，編者統計，以供國貨製造之參考。其最暢銷者，極宜設法摹仿製造，請求政府特别免稅，努力宣傳，以冀驅逐洋貨於市塲之外。國貨　烟香，味精，肥皂，琺瑯品，出世後，仇貨即無形中絶跡，尤爲過去成績之所卓著者也。</p>
<p>（丙）國貨産鎖聯合會之設立丨農民知識淺陋，購物不知選擇，易受虚僞者所欺騙。亟應指導組織消費合作社，與都市各國貨工廠公司共同組織産銷聯合會，以期農民購買時，貨眞價實，知所適從，而免商人販客之剝削。</p>
<p>（丁）國貨展覽之深入丨窮鄕僻壤，囿於聞見，國貨工廠宜聯絡組織流動展覽團，在各處鄕村，流動展覽，盡量介紹於農民，俾對於國貨有相當之認識與信仰之提高。</p>
<p>以上四端，不過其　　大者。最後，吾人應明瞭此種提高購買力之政策，爲消極而非積極，爲治標而非治本。眞正購買力之提高，須在整個農業經濟問題得到解决之後，始可健全而持久。是吾人目今對於此種消極的政策，作相當努力外，並須對於根本的解脫帝國主義之束縛，建國穩固的民族工業非作長期奮鬭不爲功。</p>
<h3>國貨消息</h3>
<p>西湖毛巾三友實業社最近新出了一種西湖毛巾，輕軟潔白，文雅可愛，可算是國貨年中毛巾裏的新貢獻，並聞該社爲新出品介紹與各界人士試用起見，不惜犧牲，凡於該社購貨滿國幣兩元者均附贈一條，聊答客意，且資試用云　　本市四屆國展本市之第四屆國貨運動展覽會，自日前由市民提倡國貨會議决，準定於重九日在蓬萊市塲舉行後，聞連日各國貨工廠之前往呈報參加者，十分踴躍，截至昨日（二十七日）止，已有八十餘家之多，並聞將於是日同時舉行提燈會，懸旗紥綵，燈火連天，屆時當有一番盛况也。</p>
<p>小小國貨市塲繼兩大國貨公司營業發展之後，最近却又發現了一個「小小國貨市塲」它的地址，是在二馬路盡錦里，雖然規模很小，貨物也不多，但渠爲推銷國貨，發展市塲則一，較之幾個大百貨公司，反專靠販賣洋貨以謀利的，自然已高勝幾籌。</p>
<p>籌徴傾銷稅與全國生産會議這是關係政府方面，最近對於國貨，前途的新設施，係實財兩部深鑒外貨傾銷，國貨衰落，根據民二十年九月國府公佈之傾銷貨物稅法章程，將於傾銷最烈之外貨十種，（現聞暫定植紗絲綢茶葉布疋米麥木材魚類燈泡火柴等十種）。徴收傾銷稅，以冀國貨發展，而實部召集舉行之「全國生産會議」，亦决將於最近開幕，齊集全國國貨界鉅子，共同討論，改良技術，增進生産，聯合一致，組成全國生産之網，爲國貨前途謀福利云。</p>
<p>短訊値茲秋令，疫癘叢生，偶不淸潔，即罹疾病之危，苟常備臭藥水灑射穢處，病菌即告絶跡，國貨臭藥水中，以雙刀牌銷路最佳，聞南洋羣島及北方各埠，連日向信源行批購者，日必數起</p>

<h3>四庫全書珍本</h3>
<p>— 茸之餘</p>
<p>現在除兵爭，政爭等類之外，還有一種倘非閒人，就不大注意的影印「四庫全書」中的「珍本」之爭。官商要照原式，及早印成，學界却以爲庫本有删改。有錯誤，倘有别本可得，就應該用别的「善本」來替代。</p>
<p>但是，學界的主張是不會通過的，結果總非依照「欽定四庫全書」不可。這理由很分明，就因爲要趕快。四省不見，九鳥出脫，不說也罷，單是黃河的出軌舉動，也就令人覺得岌岌乎不可終日，要做生意就得趕快。况且「欽定」二字，至今也還是有一點威光，「御醫」「貢緞」，就是與衆不同的意思。便是早已共和了的法國，拿破崙的藏書在拍賣塲上還是比平民的藏書値錢；歐洲的著名的「支那學者」，講中國就會引用「欽定圖書集成」，這是中國的考據家所不肯玩的玩藝，但是，也可見印了「欽定」過的「珍本」，在外國，生意總可以比「善本」好一些。</p>
<p>即使在中國，恐怕生意也還是「珍本」好。因爲這可以做擺飾。而「善本」却不過能合於實用。能買這樣的書的，决非窮措大也可起，則買去之後，必將供在客廳上也亦可知。這類的買主，會買一個商周的古鼎，擺起來，不得已時，也許買一個假古鼎，擺起來，但他决不肯買一個沙鍋或鐵鑊，擺在紫檀桌子上。因爲他的目的是在「珍」而並不在「善」，更不在是否能合於實用的。</p>
<p>明末人好名，刻古書也是一種風氣，然而往往自己看不懂，以爲錯字，隨手亂改。不改尙可，一改，可就返而改錯了，所以使後來的考據家爲之歎氣，說是明人好刻古書而古書亡。這回的「四庫全書」中的「珍本」是影印的，决無改錯的弊病，然而原本就有無意的誤字，有故意的删改，並且因爲新本的流布，更能使善本　沒下去，將來的認眞的讀者如果偶爾得到這樣的本子，恐怕總免不了要有歎氣第二回。</p>
<p>然而結果總非依照「欽定四庫全書」不可。因爲「將來」的事，和現在的官商是不相干了。</p>
<h3>蘇州人與催眠曲</h3>
<p>— 友聲</p>
<p>黃昏時，在蘇州觀前的街上，常看見電光下擠擠的人頭，仰對着大商站的門額在發呆。在門額上放出一種柔聲柔氣的聲音來，像米湯似的：「唔唔唔·········丨丨」這是無線電器在播送陳玉梅的催眠曲。擠擠的人頭，被那音波粘合在一處，旣不搖晃，也不出聲，眼睛是睜開的，其實都像睡着了。</p>
<p>陳玉梅唱的催眠曲傳播到蘇州來，原是借重「一個磨光黑色的圓圈，中畫一隻狗在一個喇叭之前」那東西的。</p>
<p>這回是家家戶戶，都學唱起來了。擅長軟語的吳儂，與這歌曲的腔調的融合，是有着特出的天才的。雖然少爺們也要哼哼，但是他們究竟還是聽起來舒服，並且咬着瓜子皮。</p>
<p>在這無聲的中國，催眠曲，可以算是蘇州人的聲音了。因爲二者在任何一面都有着絶對的調和。</p>
<p>在生活上，且看代表蘇州人重要生活的集合塲丨丨茶坊，那裏面光景，最是嚴肅。茶客們，由早到晚的都圍住四方桌面，由早到晚。神經底的說來，蘇州人一年到頭不歸家，躱在茶坊裏，龍　呀，雀舌呀，品箇不了。彷彿都魂游杯底，身入壺天。雖有一種喧　的聲浪流滾着，也是等於鼾聲夢囈。這里沒有催眠曲的歌聲，但蘊藏着濃重的催眠空氣。這空氣任情的浮盪着，布滿了全蘇州城。</p>
<p>蘇州，這「搖籃」裏，睡着有乘囝阿六頭；也睡着有我們的蘇炳文將軍。（將軍現枕戈於蘇）</p>
<p>蘇州，本來是最適宜，最應該睡覺的一個地方。即使沒有催眠曲聽。</p>
<p>吾鄕人回說某人在睡覺，是不道破「睡覺」二字的：「上蘇州去了」丨因爲蘇州是草蓆的出産所在。旣有史實的流傳，就無怪現在的富翁要人，都說蘇州這地方很淸靜；淸靜中不正是最好睡睡覺嗎？把蘇州城改作「睡都」，又有什麽不可以的。</p>
<p>而况，蘇州的娘兒們唱的催眠曲頂好聽！</p>
<p>林語堂先生前幾天發表意見：「讓娘兒們幹一下吧！他自己打算下野出洋，不聞外事。（論語還是要編的罷）這主張是十分目量的，對於一切男人們。雖經虞明先生說明了「娘兒們也不行」，並引「養生者不足以當大事」一言，批評語堂先生只知讀論語，不知讀孟子。然而，虞明先生蓋亦未之深思也啊······　　倘使娘兒們大家齊聲唱道：「不要吵，不要閙，寳貝睡一覺，噢丨丨丨」自然是睡着了，連娘兒們自己，大家有覺睡，人生大事已了一椿。再聽：「睡着了，睡醒了，起來喫塊糕······」糕，不問是什麽糕，總比樹皮草根好吃些吧。　　二萬萬多人祇管「催」，二萬萬多人祇管「眠」，結果，大家都睡覺，欲求天下之不太平，又安可得。我故曰：以睡治天下，其成可立而待也。</p>
<p>帶便說來，全國的女人們，如有不懂催眠曲唱法的，可以請問蘇州人；男人中有被催而不眠的，亦可請敎蘇州人。　　蘇州人，在中國，即是在世界上，他們都算撤底精通了催與眠，而又非常之客氣來希的。</p>
<h3>風的故事</h3>
<p>— 孫泱</p>
<p>因爲我住的房子已經有了年紀，站不穩脚跟；所以前好幾天閱報見將有大風光臨滬地時，心中不覺惴惴。担心了一夜，風却幸而沒有來。</p>
<p>可是我的「風」却想開了，從前宋玉和景差陪着楚襄王遊於蘭臺之宮，有風颯然而至，襄王大樂說：「快哉！此風寡人與庶人共者耶？宋玉連忙回答：「此獨大王之風耳！」接着施展「帮閒」奇才，把大王之風描述一通：開初這風起於太山之阿：「飄忽淜滂，激颺熛怒；蹶石伐木，梢殺林奔。」先在皇城外發足威風，才「乘臨高城，入於深宮·」已兜了幾個圈，自是只剩下了風尾巴、吹着襄王肚皮，當然快活。</p>
<p>宋玉這一拍，甚是得體。景差在旁，只好乾體　，屈原躱在汩　江底，恐怕也要後悔自己太老實，連個徒弟也不如。千百年後，李後主徧徧又不曉事，竟然「自忙」起來，以「小樓昨夜又東風」得禍，與宋玉相較，玉實不愧描風聖手！　　旣有大王之風，必有庶人之風，宋玉說這風起於窮巷之間，「動沙堁，吹死灰，駭溷濁，揚腐餘。」吹入鼻孔，敢是不大舒服，和「徘徊桂椒之　」的大王之風一比，也難怪襄王自滿。不過宋玉未留心到大王之風在城外發威時，庶人已經受夠了。虧得襄王糊塗丨丨或者竟是裝糊塗丨丨不然宋玉也恐難免碰壁。　　裝糊塗得體，拍馬屁風行，我却又覺得大王之風有點「第三種人」的「推」的氣味。這正和前兩天還未吹到外灘的大厦的風，在浦東老白渡草泥塘攪起一塲大火，燒盡二千貧民的草棚一樣。</p>
<p>我又想到繞過上海的大暴風，如果眞來了，能算什麽風呢？俗一點是龍捲風，雅一點，按照「帮閒」文人的筆法，只好算委員主席風了。好在這風只在東海南部繞個圈，就直奔朝鮮日未去了。</p>
<p>於是我便二重安心！</p>
<h3>秋意</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>又是秋天了。</p>
<p>風從窗外吹來，使我身上平添了不少凉意。</p>
<p>我不禁記起了往事：丨丨</p>
<p>也是這麽一個秋天，我伴了哭着的妻，載着活了八個月的孩子的棺骸，一同到萬國公墓。</p>
<p>孩子是患了急性霍亂死的。</p>
<p>眼睜睜的瞧着三四個苦力把這孩子的棺骸埋葬，一切細微的聲音都深深擊在我心上。我的心劇烈地痛楚着。淚珠如錢似的落在地上，和着妻的淚。</p>
<p>孩子的聲容笑貎永遠杳然了。我想起過去八個月的時間，宛似做了一場好夢。現在，夢醒了，它所遺留給我的只有痛苦和悲哀，沒有别的什麽。</p>
<p>我默默地在孩子的墳墓上獻上花圈，花圈上繫着這麽的字：「你無罪的靈魂，你安逸地住在天國吧！」</p>
<p>在歸途中，我的心是凉的，和秋天的風一樣的凉。</p>
<p>今天，我又接觸着這樣的凉風，我猛然的記起來：是孩子的週年了。</p>
<p>我放下了手裏的工作跑出去，買了個花圈，坐車到萬國公墓。</p>
<p>站在孩子的墓前，我惘然了，我想起了一年來的事。</p>
<p>這眞是個劇烈變動的時代，我從沒有見過時代的輪子轉動得這麽快。在這時代的輪子下，農村在急遽地崩潰，河山在繼續破碎，黃河在汜濫，頻於死亡的民衆在呼號，沒落階級在髑髏上狂舞。　　而擠在中間層的我，還僥倖地能得生活着，這實在是幸運的。</p>
<p>可是孩子也是幸運的：他不致死在黑暗的角落裏，埋葬在黑暗的角落裏，爲人所見不到，想不起，並且能領受我所獻給他的花圈。</p>
<p>我默默地在孩子的墳墓上獻上花圈，誠心的禱祝着：</p>
<p>「你無罪的靈魂，你安逸地住在天國吧！」</p>
<h3>女人（七）</h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>她并不需要明白這些。她住到一個濱海著名的旅館中後，每日皆默默的躺到海灘白沙大傘下眺望著大海太空的明藍。她正在用北海風光，洗去留在心上的南海厭人印象。她在休息。她在等待。</p>
<p>有時儹了一匹白馬，到山上各處跑去，或過無人浴處，沿海潮汐退盡的砂灘上跑去。有時又一人獨自坐在一隻小艇内，慢慢的搖著小漿，把船划到離岸遠到三里五里的海中，儘那隻小艇在一汪鹽水中漂流蕩漾。</p>
<p>陌生地方陌生的人羣，却并不使她感到孤寂。在淸靜無擾的孤獨生活中，她有了一個同伴，就是她自己的心。</p>
<p>當她躺在砂上時，她對於自然與對於本性，皆似乎多認識了一些。她看一切，聽一切，分析一切，皆似乎比先前明敏一些。</p>
<p>尤其使她愉快的，便是到了這地方來，若干遊客中，似乎并無一個人明白她是誰，雖仿彿有若干雙陌生的眼睛，每日皆可在砂灘中無意相碰，她且料想到，這些眼睛或者還常常在很遠處與隱避處注視到她，但却并無什麽麻煩。一個女子卽或如何厭煩男子，在意識中，也仍然常常的把這種由於自己美麗使男子現出種種蠢像的印象。作爲一種秘密悅樂的　時節，我們固然不能歡喜一個啫酒的人，但一個文學者筆下的酒徒，却并不使我們看來皺眉，這世界上，也正有若干種爲美所傾倒的人類姿態，現味起來令人微笑！</p>
<p>划船是好所擅長的運動，××的海面早晚尤宜於輕舟浮泛。有一天她獨自又駕了那白色小艇，打着喝漿，沿海向東駛去。</p>
<p>東方爲日頭所出的地方，也應當有光明熱烈如日頭的東西，等待在那邊。可是所等待的是什麽？</p>
<p>在東方除了兩個遠在十哩以外金字塔形的島嶼以外，就只一片爲日光鍍上銀色的大海。這大海上午是銀色，下午則成爲藍色，放出藍寳石的光輝。一片空闊的海，使人幻想無邊的海。</p>
<p>東邊一點，還有兩個海灣，也有砂灘，可以作海水浴，游人却異常稀少。</p>
<p>她把船慢慢的划去，想到了第三個海灣時爲止。她歡喜從船上看海邊景物。她歡喜如此寂寞地玩着，就因她早爲熱鬧弄疲倦了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「偷」和「搶」</h3>
<p>— 因</p>
<p>丨爲「談窮」答「乾序」先生丨</p>
<p>前不久，我在本刋上談過一次「窮」。我的意是說：「窮」是最有剌激的而最充實的生活；惟有經過了「窮」的階級，才能有永久的偉大的眞實的創造。但好些好些「窮人」却爲了「窮」而吃不得苦，便「偷」「搶」去了，這就是他們觀點和行動的大錯誤丨因爲「偷」「搶」以後，他們固不再「窮」，並且個人可賴以溫飽享樂，然而，事實上，因他們的「偷」「搶」而得的個人溫飽和享樂，除了他們實行「偷」「搶」的幾個而外丨再不會有更多的人得着一些好處，並且倒是「窮」的製造所中增加了幾員生力的老閭丨所以，壓根兒，這就是反動的錯誤的狹義的不徹底的個大主義的觀念！還有因征服不了「窮」的「苦」，於是便自殺了，這又眞是最不　憐的可羞的沒出息的弱者之醜態的暴露！因爲他不理解「窮」是一爐熊熊的火熖的能夠燃燒出熱烈的向上的動的情緒，他更不理解「窮」，是充實生活的燈塔，照耀着我們在生命的旅程上努力奮門做實際的進取和創造，當然的，他亦不會知道「窮」的病症之所致以及診斷窮的脈膊之所在了丨丨我相信，我的話不盡然是離開事實的空言，因爲世界革命文豪高爾基便是十足地在「窮」的波濤中打了千萬以至無數滾而最後成功了的一員。</p>
<p>前天本刋上有位「乾序」先生因也的朋友爲着「窮」而在燕子磯頭「死不得」牌前葬身了港流，所以他就藉爲反攻我的證據。理由是：他的朋友雖是弱者：但假使他的朋友能「偷」和「搶」，便不至於去投河自殺了。最後他還提出「偷」和「搶」是「人」的「本能」，不是「可羞」和「沒出息」的口號。</p>
<p>其實，這一證據是永遠不會成其爲證據的丨理由，在「談窮」裏我已講過。本文前段也說了點，現在再補充一些，就拿「乾」先生的朋友來說吧：假定「乾」先生的朋友眞的像「乾」先生所設想的去「偷」去「搶」，那麽，他的朋友不便個人不死不成問題，而且還滿有發財，至少，個人溫飽享樂的希望，從此他個人是不再「窮」不再「苦」的快活人了！然而，對於大衆有些什麽好處呢？······又假定這確是一個趕「窮」袪「苦」的方法，於是「窮人」們便都各自爲謀的去埋頭競競作這能致個人溫飽享樂的「偷」和「搶」，於是，當然的，一切熱烈的向上的動的創造的情緒統統幻滅了，「燈塔」上的光熄了，「爐」中的火滅了，努力奮鬥的進取的陣線緩和而終至於動搖了，未來的憧憧着的，除了個人的「偷」和「搶」的追求以外，仍然是個人「偷」和「搶」！世界便成了一個反動的錯誤的觀念狹養不徹底的個人主義的世界　！··········</p>
<p>但是，但是「乾」先生的朋友究竟還是燕子磯頭「死不得」牌前的一員可羞的沒出息的弱者！</p>
<p>最後，從「竊國」至「竊鈎」，因是證明這是一個「偷」和「搶」的强盜世界，然而我不相信「偷」和「搶」就正是「窮」的必然的反映出的行動，更要否認是「人」的「本能」！</p>
<h3>吃醋之心人皆有之</h3>
<p>— 珍之</p>
<p>孟子曰：「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，這句話的意思，似乎人家有悽凉之事，假若看見了的話，沒有一個惻隱之心，不油然而起的，在下却以爲不然，一個乞丐，及衫　褸地跟在一個衣衫麗都闊哥兒的後面，連聲的少爺小開呌着，它的要求是望也發些惻隱心，週濟它一個銅元，結果呢，跟了一長段的路，還受着那接一接的「滾開些」「猪玀」「討嫌」這樣的咒駡，如是看來，要求人門的惻隱心，顯然是一件不容易的事進而至於，咱們的國家，因失掉了東三省而哀求國聯的惻隱，結果，却同乞丐和　哥兒的事一樣成績，這樣更足證明，「求人惻隱」，是不可能的事，那麽「惻隱之心，人皆有之」一變而成泛語了，在下要將泛語改作實語，於是冒失地改了「吃醋之心，人皆有之」自然亦有相當的理由</p>

<h3>悲黃水</h3>
<p>— 常遵先</p>
<p>黃河崩潰浸華嵩，汾水西兮濟水東，奔騰倒海勢澎湃，人物如山駭蛟龍，夜臥全家人一屋，隨波捲入鯨魚腹，百里猶聞飛濤聲，近亦不聞人聲哭，祗見屍隨浪花浮，飛鳥喙背魚打頭，欲撈水急難鼓掉，夕陽獨立淚橫流，頻年袛歎沙塲苦，血肉狼籍肥豺虎，杜骨猶　坯土中，那似長隨流沙腐，旣云軍閥固不仁，河伯不慈何爲神，若云刦數歸天命，如何盡死無辜民，昻頭問玉宸，甄陶失大鈞，啞泉禍水，何不同淪，豈無德補，皇天不親，云胡不遜心不服，半間堂中多閑福，君不聞車馬魚貫警蹕聲，無愁一曲兮　山歇伏。（却酬）</p>
<p>人們只知「吃醋」二字，是專用於兩性間的爭風，打架而不知「吃醋」的要素是何種成分所結成的，有人說當然酸素是主要份子，那麽酸素却是何種原料做成的，却　目不能對了，實際，極容易，無非在「所愛的東西，不欲它人染指」之下造成這種原料，換一句說，這就是酸素，從那酸素上推究下去，除了那兩性間的爭風，打架應有的吃醋外，咱們可以說市儈井徒的攫名奪利，脫不了吃酸的成份，大人先生們的爭權刮錢，更脫不了吃醋的成份，因爲依據原料成則上着想，可以確信無疑了，</p>
<p>醋是不可不吃的，原因是與有生以來俱來的，何以呢？你不是常常看見報上姦殺案······爭風······打架（爲女人）···等一切，足以表顯着醋是天賦的，那麽商人們愛錢，買日貨，大人們愛錢，刮民膏，都是免不了的事，於是在下將「惻隠之心」人皆有之」改作「吃醋之心，人皆有之」豈不覺得妥恊些！</p>

<h3>門當戶對</h3>
<p>「×府里的佩英小姐，長得比以前益愛美麗了。靠了她天資的聰慧，今年纔十七歲，已在高中畢業了。不久的將來由大學而出洋留學，一定可以帶了很榮耀的女博士，碩士，學士的頭銜，很威風地回來。但看將來誰家少爺有福討這位才貎雙全的千金做家小」。×鎭上的民衆個個腦門裏在這樣的推想着。　　×老爺夫婦倆對於這「掌上明珠」的佩英的婚姻，着實也費了多年心血了，雖然許多人來話親，總是小心翼翼地詳加考慮，希望揀一家「門當戶對」的人家，方能允許，庶不誤了愛女的終身大事。</p>
<p>今天×老爺的心潮上又泛起了一陣「佩英婚姻問題」的波痕，他想女兒的年齡也不小了，况且高中已經畢業，在「男大當婚女大當嫁」的原則上，再不能把佩英的終身躭誤下去了，這兩天跑來新流行曲</p>
<p>話親的也很多，總得揀一家好的答允了，也好了却自己做父母的一種責任。想到這里，忙跑進去和夫人商酌。</p>
<p>「夫人，我想佩兒的年紀也不小了，古人說的「男大當婚女大當嫁」，近來旣有許多人家來話親，也應該早早選擇了一家「門當戶對」的允許了，也好了却我兩人的一椿心事」。</p>
<p>他的夫人聽人也以爲然，答道：「老爺，你的話不錯，兒女的婚嫁，正是做父母的天職，理應早日把她終身配定，也是盡了我們的責任，况且再要蹉跎下去，她在學堂里唸書，現在外面天天在鬧着怎麽自由戀愛，佩英别也看了懐樣，像去年隔壁王家的姑娘自己跟人去結婚，出了亂子，那可丢盡我們的臉了」。</p>
<p>「照啊！但是你看近來跑來說親的那一家好，我們商定了，好去回覆他們」。　×夫人把頭低下默默地想了一回，「據我看來，孩子是許家的好，生得一表非凡，學問聽說也不差，只是家裏窮些，彀不上我們的門望！還是那姓陸的來得相配，他家有田萬多畝，現蓄也不少，雖則少爺才貎差些，但佩兒嫁過去享福是不差的，你道怎樣」？</p>
<p>×老爺把頭搖搖道：「不對丨我聽說姓陸的孩子，非但智識破脾氣壞。並且還吃上了雅片了，所以我不大贊成」！</p>
<p>「老爺，你的話錯是不錯，但是一個人活在世上，只要豐衣足食就是，管怎麽智識學問，况且現在世界上的人，都是「只重衣衫不重人」，你有錢，人家來奉敬你，你有智識，誰來希罕你！講到他家少爺吃雅片，我想有了百萬家財，不憂吃窮的了，並且俗語說的「富家郎吃上雅片保家當」，所以吃烟是沒有關係的啊」！</p>
<p>×老爺被他這位賢明的夫人把世故人情解釋，心中恍然大悟，再加上想到「門當戶對」四字，於是知嘻嘻地說道：「就照這樣吧！雖則雅片鬼，但是總算「門當戶對」，呵呵」。</p>

<h3>怎樣募寫捐金？</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>有許多讀者，發生疑難問題，一經求，×承先生一指示，解决不少倒懸。這是多麽値得歌頌的事情。先生旣能慈航普渡，拯人於水火，想必能接受在下的要求，而樂於指導吧。</p>
<p>在下的家鄕是在徽州歙南：從小就到上海來，在一家布店裏學業。屈指光陰，不覺也有十幾年了，但是做小夥計所得的酬報，終是不見寬裕的，幸虧自己節儉措算，把汗血交換來的微資，顧養着一家數口，度此慘淡光陰，深覺額汗淋　了。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的，前月接到家鄕來信，說道在五月十四日，歙南一帶，突然霪雨傾盆，山洪暴發，洪水澎湃，勢如奔馬，平地水深盈丈，傾間頓成澤國，淹沒田園，冲坍屋宇。災黎之哀器求號，溺屍之東西飄流，災情奇重，誠亘古所罕有。在下家住於斯，亦同遭池魚之殃，茫茫災處，盡成俄莩。消息傳來，客處外地者，何等焦痛。後經當地機關詳報省府，時隔匝月，仍無若何救濟辦法。於是諸鄕長籌議，發起「歙縣第五區水災救濟會」，由各發起人擔任募捐冀集腋成裘，以續不死者一線生命。所　在前天又接到那會　　來　本相册。呌我在外從速集募，以應急需。</p>
<p>先生，拯苦救難，本人之天職，何况誼屬桑梓。情關骨肉，愈加義不容辭。可是在下投生不幸，却做了小夥計的地位，那裏有這種資格，配得上持册向人求捐呢？回想到本人經濟狀况！已如上述的困難，救濟之心雖熱，補助之力無方，言之多麽慚愧啊。唉！在這氣燄逼迫，財勢欺人的畸形社會裏，祇有大人巨客，只要一啓尊口，一時募集五千一萬，本不算得稀罕的一椿事情。要是像在下身底職卑的人，任你口乾唇焦，誠懇求人，誰來賞你的顔兒？顧及這許多災黎的　　呢？自古經濟拮据，手頭節儉的窮友，勢必交友寡鮮，即或有一二人愛好，無非處於同等地位，所謂愛莫能助，滴水難救烈火。要是　册寄回去吧，對於良心上有負重大的使命，更兼將來如何有顔面重返故鄕？所以日夜愁思，勝比親臨其境尤苦。先生你是抱成人之美的大恩公，懇求指示南針，應用何種方法，使這敖敖待哺萬命賴此的捐册。足以有想當的報命呢，還請賜答。程烈甫拜啓</p>
<p>編者按：惻隠之心，人皆有之。不過「視他人之飢如己飢，視他人之溺如己溺，祗是一種過分的形容罷了，實際那裏眞會有這種人呢？所以最普通人，總是採取「先己後人」，以及「親我親以及人之親」的政策。</p>
<p>現在你家鄕遭了水災，波及　眷，目下最切要的，當然在設法救濟家族。能夠不需要公團的助力，就是替公團留一分力量，去多救濟其他的災黎。至於籌欵救濟，當然是一椿好事；但這是一般有餘力的人的義務，足下大可不必勉强。</p>
<p>在這普遍鬧窮的社會裏，捐不到錢，很是平常，更談不到失面子，以至於無顔面回故鄕。雖則捐不出錢，捐不到錢，但是不需要人家救濟，已經算不得十分窮。何况眞的是窮人了骨，也是無傷面子，借題發揮，捐欵自肥，弄到後來，交不出賬來，才是十足失面子的事情呢！</p>

<p>第一幕生與死</p>
<p>兵士庚：報告連長，人在這裏。　　排長：裏面再拿幾個燈來。</p>
<p>連長：你呌什麽名字？</p>
<p>靑年：我呌吳春山。我是右北口逃來的。這兒有一封信，請老爺看一看。（在破衣襟裏掏出一封信。又洋錢一封。）還有四十元錢。</p>
<p>（連長讀信，一面拿銀玩弄，似乎想這封銀元沒收。）</p>
<p>靑年：自古北口給日本兵打下了以後，我們村裏的房子燒了一大半。人也殺得不少。我們很希望老爺派兵反攻。將日本兵打退，救救我們老百姓的性命。我們都窮得要命，這裏天家凑攏了四十塊錢，讓大家弟兄們在路上買買香烟吃。雖然是很少的一點兒，非常不中意的，可是這還是大一個一個銅板凑起來的，請老爺不要見笑。</p>
<p>連長：這樣嗎？好的。（將錢放進衣袋去）明天我給你見師長說說看。你現在回去。沒有事了，放他回去罷。（連長竟去，排長亦隨下。靑年愕然。兵士們亦面面相觎。）（誰也不說話，靜默。約三分鐘之久。）</p>
<p>兵士乙：（學連長的動作和口音）這樣嗎？好。明天我給你見師長說說看。你現在回去。沒有事了，放他去罷。</p>
<p>大家：哈哈哈哈哈。</p>
<p>兵士甲：他媽的，提是方便，一會兒便是四十。</p>
<p>靑年：難道我們的錢就落空了嗎？兵士庚：誰知道？</p>
<p>大家：哈哈哈哈（苦笑）</p>
<p>兵士甲：欠這傻瓜！你們的錢太多啦。（忽然有着猛烈的大砲聲，機關槍聲。）</p>
<p>兵士乙：怎麽的？打過來了嗎？　　（又是一聲）</p>
<p>兵士庚：我們已經退兵了，他媽還要打過來嗎？（步槍聲）你們聽，槍聲也聽得出來了。</p>
<p>兵士戊：眞的是打近了。（兵士甲首先睡下，預備放，其餘人也跟着睡下。）</p>
<p>兵士甲：敎他們都出來，現在是拚命的時候了。（槍聲愈近愈密）</p>
<p>兵士丁：我們一天退了一百五十里，也算跑得快着，難道他們就追過來了嗎？（軍號聲，是緊急集中的命令。）</p>
<p>排長：（急促的跑來。）快！大家站隊。</p>
<p>（一聲命令，大家立起）</p>
<p>兵士丁：排長！是怎麽一回事呀？　　排長：快！快！日本兵又要打過來了。</p>
<p>兵士乙：那末還不反攻嗎？</p>
<p>兵士庚：現在怎麽的？又是要退嗎？</p>
<p>兵士甲：我們還不反攻嗎？我們眞的就待等死嗎？</p>
<p>排長：沒有什麽好問，上面有命令。快退。快！</p>
<p>（兩下最響的大砲，砲彈就落在兵士們的中間。火光，黑烟，塵土飛揚。哭聲，喊聲，槍彈聲。黑烟從舞台上瀰漫到觀衆的席間。幕徐徐下。）</p>

(30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Sian) On the morning of the 29th, the weather here cleared up with a bright sun. Early in the morning, Lo Wen-kan received notification from the airport that he was cleared to depart.

<h3>Post-Incident Handling in Chahar Comes to an End</h3>
<p>Chi Hung-chang Plans to Leave Chahar and Enter Suiyuan; Jin Troops Block at Shangdu</p>
<p>Sung Sends Cavalry to Pursue Chi's Troops; Chi's Troops Flee Towards Pingtichuan</p>
<p>Fang is Willing to Return Troops; Sung's Generals Seek Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>Chiang Po-cheng Returns to Peiping to Report to Ho Ying-chin on the Handling Process</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chiang Po-cheng, Hsiao Chen-ying, Hou Ying, and Pang Ping-hsun arrived in Peiping from Changyuan this afternoon. After Chiang and Hsiao got out of the car, they went to Churenhall to visit Ho and report on everything. Chiang said, "After I arrived in Changyuan, I met with Sung and proceeded with everything according to the established policy. Sung personally went to Changpei to handle various matters. Currently, Fang and Chi's troops have limited strength and can be quickly resolved. Chi's troops are currently fleeing towards western Chahar. According to Fu Tso-yi's telegram, he has dispatched capable troops to pursue them and is blocking them at Shangdu from Pingtichuan by Chao Cheng-shou's troops. It will definitely be resolved satisfactorily. I am here to report everything to Ho." Hsiao said, "Fang has fled to Tushihkou with extremely weak strength and has no effective actions. Fang himself very much wants the government to grant him a title. This matter can be resolved within a week. Chi's troops are fleeing north of Shangdu. His subordinates are deeply influenced by communism and will be thoroughly resolved." I came to Peiping to report to the military branch on behalf of Sung on the progress of handling various matters. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After Sung Che-yuan returned to Changyuan from Changpei yesterday, he met with Chiang Po-cheng to discuss the handling of Fang and Chi's affairs. Sung previously sent Chen Hsi-wen and Chang Yun-jung to meet with Fang. Fang stated that he was willing to return the troops to the government and was still considering going abroad, but hoped to get a title. Since Fang had this expression, Sung planned to resolve the matter of Fang's generals peacefully. Chi held a meeting with Chang Hui-tao, Hsuan Hsia-fu, and others in Erchaizi on the 27th. As a result, he was unwilling to accept reorganization by the government, so he fled west of Erchaizi again. Currently, the troops are hiding in the mountains more than 20 miles north of Ta Tsingkou. Sung dispatched Chang Ling-yun's cavalry to pursue them, capturing more than 200 people, more than 100 guns, and more than 100 supply carts. Chi's troops fled towards Pingtichuan. On the 28th, Sung went to northern Changpei again to direct military affairs, hoping to resolve Chi's troops. Chi's troops are very weak and their morale is scattered, making them easy to resolve. After Sung returned to Changyuan yesterday, he jointly reported to Chiang with Chiang Po-cheng, stating the details of handling the Chahar affairs. Sung planned to go to Changpei again in four or five days for inspection. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chi Hung-chang led Hsuan Hsia-fu and others to flee from Ta Tsingkou to Shangdu. The Jin army cavalry regiment originally stationed in Shangdu suddenly withdrew on the night of the 28th. After receiving the report, Sung dispatched the Wang Tzu-liang regiment of the guard to station in Shangdu to block them. Fang took more than 300 people to Tushihkou. Kao Shu-hsun arrived in Changpei on the 28th to visit Sung. The post-incident handling in Chahar came to an end. Fu Tso-yi telegraphed Sung and Chiang on the 28th that he had dispatched capable troops to the Chahar-Suiyuan border to block them. Chao Cheng-shou transferred from Pingtichuan to Nanhaotsien on the night of the 28th. Liu Kuei-tang, representing Tien Kang-yi, returned to Chicheng on the 29th, denying reports of war preparations. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chi Hung-chang's troops plan to leave Chahar and enter Suiyuan, boarding a train at Pingtichuan to go elsewhere. The Jin army has dispatched a regiment each of infantry, cavalry, and artillery to block them in Suiyuan. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After visiting Ho, Hsiao Chen-ying will go to Nanking and Kiangsi in one or two days to report. Chao Teng-yu's division is gradually moving towards the Chahar border in succession these days. Liu Ju-ming's division will begin to be transported to the Chahar border starting today. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chang Li-sheng's troops are all local militias and will be ordered to disband, returning their guns to the local area. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Pang Ping-hsun said, "I went to Chang this time to meet with Sung, Chiang, and others. My headquarters was previously ordered to establish the Tenth Army Corps. The military post-incident handling in Chahar has ended, and I will automatically request to cancel the name of the Army Corps headquarters. The Army headquarters is currently in Hsuanhua and will not move for the time being. This time, the resolution of the Chahar affairs was based on the central government's order. The Chahar situation in the past was complex and should be resolved quickly to avoid affecting diplomacy. My troops are still stationed in Chahar Province and are actively suppressing bandits. I came to Peiping to visit Ho and will return to Hsuanhua in a few days to defend the area." In Changchiakou, Chiang Po-cheng, Chin Teh-chun, and Hou Ying believe that the post-incident handling here is coming to an end and returned to Peiping at 9:00 p.m. The Chahar affairs are expected to end soon. Chi's troops are expected to be wiped out. The number of troops is very small. Fang has arrived at Tushihkou. After Chi's troops are completely resolved, then Fang will be dealt with. If Fang submits, everything can be discussed, but the prerequisite is that he must leave the army first. Sun Liang-cheng returned to Tientsin to see his father who is ill and will go to Peiping in a few days to meet with Ho. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pang Ping-hsun is still in Changchiakou. According to him, "I was ordered to enter Chahar this time. Fortunately, it was resolved peacefully, allowing the people of Chahar to be spared some suffering. I am deeply gratified. Regarding the commander of bandit suppression, etc., these were temporary titles. I never organized them from the beginning." He added that after meeting with Sung, he would return to Hsuanhua to defend the area. (29th)</p>

The central government should first send personnel to estimate the construction of the major dikes in Lanfeng, arrange dedicated funds, and the relevant provinces should urge them at any time. 3. The central government should stipulate special regulations for preventing the Yellow River from seizing the Huai River to be permanently observed. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Sino-Vietnamese Trade Treaty is Unlikely to be Signed</h3>
<p>(Nanking) The Sino-French Vietnamese trade treaty is unlikely to be signed because the transit tax in the supplementary agreement needs to be discussed with Minister Sung before a decision can be made on whether our country will send a consul to Annam to protect overseas Chinese merchants in the future.

<h3>The Seriousness of the Bandit Situation in Northern Hebei</h3>
<p>The North China War Zone: From the beginning of the takeover until today, more than a month has passed. After several obstacles and twists, it seems that it can be declared over in general terms. However, according to the reality, the five major passes along the Great Wall are still under the trampling of nomadic cavalry, and the remaining dozens of secondary passes are still occupied by enemy troops. Dushan and Xinglong are protruding beyond the customs, refusing to be returned. Linyu County is adjacent to the puppet territory, forcing relocation. Even in the counties that have been taken over, how can they get rid of the restraints of the Japanese? The number of troops stationed in Miyun is not decreasing but increasing. The construction of the airport in Zunhua is in full swing. Puppet troops are rampant in Yutian, and Chinese traitors are active in Tangshan. In other places such as Luanzhou, Qian'an, Jianchangying, and Shixia, there is no place where arrogant soldiers are not seen rampant. No administrative measure is free from Japanese interference. The so-called return is just a nominal reward. "The government is run by Ning, but the sacrifices are made by me alone." This is the biggest concession that the Japanese side considers.</p>
<p>However, the bad situation does not stop there. Recently, the bandit atmosphere in the eastern counties of Luanhe River has become increasingly rampant. They gather in groups and openly extort money. The area along the mouth is particularly rampant. Light and heavy machine guns, mortars, and field artillery, which are called new-style combat weapons, are all fully equipped. With this, they engage in plunder, and it is not surprising that they are in a state of being uncontrollable. In a war zone that has been occupied by the enemy for a long time, so many bandit troops suddenly appear. How can such despicable bandits in the mountains and forests possess such sophisticated weapons? From where does the supply and support come? Someone is behind the scenes, and it is about to be revealed. With a little thought, it is not difficult to understand. The county magistrates are on the border and are often held hostage, living like corpses with a dying breath. They have no vitality and can be knocked down with a finger. How can they withstand being destroyed? Dong Tianhua fled to Tianjin in a panic, and Zhang Gaichen broke through the encirclement and fled. This is what we expected. However, the Japanese news agency is using this opportunity to publicize and help the bandits spread their lies. It says that the order in Qin Island has fallen into chaos, or that Tangshan has been suddenly attacked by bandits. It says that the Japanese police in Yuguan have rushed to protect it, or that Song Naigan is discussing with the Japanese military commander. The fact that they want to create terror as a pretext for wrongdoing can be easily predicted from their past actions. The future crisis in North China is brewing in secret.</p>
<p>The reason why the Japanese are replaying the meaning of provocation this time is not necessarily due to the military returning to the old path, but can be regarded as a sudden diplomatic threat. Since the signing of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, after being complacent, the Japanese soldiers thought that our country would completely surrender and listen to their wishes. They also wanted to use this to end the military affairs and declare a complete victory. However, they suddenly heard that Song Ziwen had established a cotton and wheat loan in the United States and promoted technical cooperation in the League of Nations, which immediately made their suspicious eyes turn into flames of rage. In the past month, they have done everything possible to destroy technical cooperation. Since Luo Wengan's inspection of Xinjiang and Wang's proposal to concurrently serve as foreign minister, Japanese propagandists have been moved again, trying their best to promote the transformation of our country's foreign policy. At the same time, they are also singing high about preparing to welcome Song Ziwen's visit to Japan, intending to lure our country into their trap. However, Song's visit to Japan did not land, and all signs disappeared. This is a major disappointment for the Japanese. Because of disappointment, they become suspicious. Because of suspicion, they threaten, drawing swords and bows, demanding alliances. Where will their wild ambitions and greed lead? All these speculations should not be completely false.</p>
<p>Knowing where the Japanese cunning plots lie, our government authorities must urgently seek countermeasures. How to use diplomatic means to resolve the current disputes, and how to coordinate resistance plans to ensure the security of North China, all of which should be gathered from collective thinking and acted upon immediately. If we still repeat the old mistakes of procrastination and sitting idly by, then the previous mistakes can be found again, and the disaster of biting the navel will be unavoidable. The people in the North China region who have survived the disaster have not recovered from their wounds, and the hidden pain is still strong. How can we bear to let them fall into an unfathomable abyss again?</p>

<p>(Qingdao) The Jiaozhou Railway Management Committee decided to find ways to raise funds to provide relief to the flood victims in Shandong Province. The methods are currently being discussed by various departments. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Domestic Grain Sales Stagnant, Ministry of Railways Not Responsible</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of the Ministry of Railways stated that the Ministry of Railways has reduced freight charges separately for grain transportation, but sales have not been smooth so far. The key is that foreign grain is imported duty-free and arbitrarily sold. Moreover, the freight policy and the tariff policy complement each other. If they are combined, the effect is great, and if they are separated, the effect is offset. Therefore, supporting domestic grain, especially the duty-free import of foreign rice, is a major issue. As for the various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in the inland, which are repeated and overlapping, they are also the biggest obstacles to transportation and sales. This matter is not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry and cannot be held responsible. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zheng Case Under Investigation in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Niu Chuanchun in the Zheng Yuxiu case was tried by the criminal court of the Jiangning District Court at 10 am on the 30th. Niu and his defense lawyer Peng Wangzu appeared in court. The trial was conducted by Xu Bangzhi, the presiding judge of the criminal court. The court first asked the defendant's name, age, and address, and then asked the defendant a few questions. Then, the defendant's lawyer made a request, saying that although the defendant was a clerk, all matters were handled by the recorder Feng Quan. Please summon Feng for investigation. Feng originally lived in Shanghai, but his whereabouts are currently unknown. However, regarding the evidence that Feng worked in the local court, the three agencies of the Jiangsu High Court, the Judicial Administration Department, and the Auditing Department can obtain receipts for Feng's monthly salary by consulting the receipts and binding books of Zheng's tenure. The court ordered to grant the defendant's request to summon Feng Quan to court first, and then schedule a court hearing at a later date. (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Gongbo Discusses Feng's Recent Situation in Mount Tai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry and Commerce, returned to Beijing from Jinan on the morning of the 30th. According to him, this trip south from Peiping, passing through Mount Tai, and visiting Feng on the mountain was purely a private visit and had no political significance. The conversations were entirely about past events and the situation after a long separation. He did not talk about Feng's current or future matters. He had not heard of the rumor that the central government would appoint Feng as the Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy or the Army Inspector. Feng had no prejudices against the central government's measures, and only expressed the possibility of coming to Beijing to participate in the Fifth Plenary Session. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Chen Gongbo passed through Xuzhou on the evening of the 29th and went south. According to him, the trip to the north was for inspection. The results of the Dingxian Experimental Village were quite good. Due to the unrestored security in North China, industry and commerce cannot be promoted for the time being. He met Feng when he passed by Mount Tai, and Feng seemed to be in very good condition. He may go to Beijing for a visit soon. (29th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Duolun Puppet Troops Move West</h3>
<p>Tang Department Hopes to Return to Song for Reorganization</p>
<p>Tan Division Temporarily Stationed in Wanquan Area</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the Tang Department occupied Guyuan, the Duolun Li Shouxin puppet troops have recently moved west. Baocheng County is currently garrisoned by Zhang Lisheng's cavalry, with a total of more than 12,000 soldiers. Kangbao is garrisoned by a detachment of Zhi Yinglin. There are too many local garrisons, and the supply is extremely difficult. Tang has repeatedly sent Chief of Staff Wang Hongru to contact Zhang, hoping to return to Song for reorganization. Song has telegraphed Peiping for instructions. Some of the reorganized troops in Chahar East, such as Liu Guitang and Huang Shouchong, are stationed in Chicheng and Dushikou. The local people have suffered greatly. The provincial government receives dozens of complaints every day. Tan Zixin's troops are temporarily stationed in the Wanquan area. It is reported that the Japanese and puppet troops in Duolun are commanded by the Japanese Ozu Yanagi. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Tan Zixin issued a circular on the 26th after taking office as the commander of the newly編制的陸軍騎兵第十師 (Provisional Tenth Cavalry Division of the Army): "To all newspapers, since the Northeast Incident, our territory has fallen, and the black waters and white mountains have disappeared in the smoke of gunpowder. Our elders and brothers are groaning under the iron hooves and golden spears. Since childhood, I have aspired to join the army. Fortunately, I have encountered opportunities and have held military positions. I have deeply resented the Japanese bandits and have been determined to save the country. Therefore, I have organized a brigade and raised the banner of resistance against Japan. I have united the loyal and righteous and fought for years. Although I have failed due to lack of resources, the enemy has also been exhausted. Although I have not been able to eliminate them in one morning, is it not gratifying to avenge the country by even a fraction? This spring, Rehe was in danger, and I rushed to help. Chengde was subsequently lost, and I held Chahar East. After the Tanggu Truce, Chahar suddenly changed. The swords were drawn, and the war clouds were filled. Fortunately, the central government's policy was generous, and He, Song, Pang and other gentlemen worked hard to resolve the crisis, turn swords into plowshares, end the war in North China, and bring peace to the people. The martial arts are subdued, and the whole world admires them. Because my division was stationed in Chahar Province, it was trapped in a whirlpool. The environment was oppressive, and I was indecisive for several months. However, I have never dared to abandon my loyalty to the party and the country. My sincerity can be testified by heaven and earth. Now that the military affairs of Chahar Province are over, our central government cherishes the labor of those who have suppressed rebellion and driven out the enemy. It wants to gather and train them to serve the same hatred. Therefore, it has ordered my division to be reorganized into the Provisional Tenth Cavalry Division of the Army, and Tan Zixin has been appointed as the commander. I am grateful and ashamed. I am clumsy and unqualified for this important task. I am afraid of falling short. However, because the country is in difficulty, I cannot refuse the duty. I will do my best to repay the kindness. I took office at the headquarters of the division in Kongjia Village on the day of Youri. From now on, I swear to lead my troops, serve the central government, work hard in training, and be ready for deployment. This will never change. I hereby telegraph this to you and hope that you will understand. Tan Zixin, Commander of the Provisional Tenth Cavalry Division of the Army, bows in gratitude." (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gasoline-Soaked Rafts Intended to Burn Puppet Gunboats</h3>
<p>Suspected to be the Work of Righteous Soldiers</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to the information obtained by local officials today, someone intended to set fire to seven puppet gunboats that were anchored in Raohe (translation) on the 28th and have now returned to the Amur River. When the gunboats were anchored, rafts full of gasoline suddenly floated towards the gunboats' anchorage. The situation at the time was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, the gunboat personnel handled the situation properly and avoided any losses. Although it is rumored that this act was committed by anti-"Manchukuo" troops, all parties still believe that outsiders are in charge of this. Therefore, the method is novel, and such a huge amount of gasoline can be obtained in the border area. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Ministry Controls Resources of Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Guidance Rights Directly Under Rikkawa</p>
<p>Supervisory Rights Transferred to Araki</p>
<p>Kwantung Hall to Reduce Scope</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Guidance for the development of industry in "Manchukuo" has always been carried out under the supervision of the Governor of Kwantung Hall, the Commander of the Kwantung Army, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and other related ministries. In this way, the monism of guidance in Manchuria cannot be thorough, and the establishment of national defense resource control in Japan and Manchuria has left some regrets. Therefore, the new policy being discussed by the leaders of the Ministry of the Army is: (1) Guidance rights are directly under the Commander of the Kwantung Army. (2) Supervisory rights are transferred to the Minister of the Army and the Prime Minister. (1) Reorganize and expand the Kwantung Army Special Service Department, and establish organizations such as the Economic Staff Headquarters directly under the Commander of the Kwantung Army. These opinions are relatively strong, so they are currently negotiating with related parties and seem to be implemented within the year. If so, the Kwantung Hall will have no relationship with the development of Manchuria, and the issue of reducing the size of the hall may be realized as a result.

<h3>Japan Seeks to Stabilize Political Situation</h3>
<p>Party-Government Cooperation Emphasizes Spirit, Not Formality. The Seiyukai's National Policies Gradually Seek Realization</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of yesterday's meeting between Seiyukai President Suzuki and Prime Minister Saito, both sides expressed satisfaction. Prime Minister Saito reported the details of his meeting at the cabinet meeting, and each cabinet member also accepted the Prime Minister's opinion. The military department, which has always opposed compromise, has been very negative due to the attitude of the Seiyukai, and Army Minister Araki has also expressed opposition. If this continues, cooperation between the government and political parties may proceed smoothly, because both the military and financial groups believe that the current situation is very unfavorable to the struggle between the two groups. (30th Chinese Union Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The government has decided to gradually implement the national policies proposed by the Seiyukai through various government agencies. However, the government's opinion is not as strong as the Seiyukai's, and there is no intention to coordinate various national policies. They only want to use the spirit of national unity to overcome the difficulties of the extraordinary situation. In the future, the Seiyukai's policies will be used as a reference to create national policies, and no formal coordination will be made with the Seiyukai. If the government coordinates with the Seiyukai, it will have to obtain the consent of the Minseito Party first, and the different policies of the Minseito and Seiyukai may cause complicated problems. Now that the spiritual cooperation of Saito, Suzuki, and Wakatsuki has been established, the political situation can be said to be stable. The government is about to begin compiling the next year's budget. (30th Japan Union Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Army Minister Araki Encourages Saito</h3>
<p>Hoping to Establish National Policies</p>
<p>Enhance External Strength</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Araki met with Prime Minister Saito after yesterday's regular cabinet meeting, continuing the previous discussion on domestic and foreign issues, especially regarding the US policy towards Japan after the breakdown of the World Economic Conference, and the active plans and facilities of a certain country towards Japan. Based on the information obtained by the military, he explained, and said that in half a year, Japan's foreign relations may encounter a major crisis, which is not impossible. He hoped that the government would work harder to establish countermeasures, and that it was urgent to act, demanding the Prime Minister's efforts. At the same time, they exchanged opinions on the Seiyukai's five major policy issues. (30th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito met with Army Minister Araki for an hour after yesterday's cabinet meeting, reporting the details of the meeting of the three party leaders (Suzuki, Wakatsuki, and Adachi) and the content of the national policies proposed by President Suzuki. Araki expressed to Saito that the military was also very satisfied and encouraged Saito to make further efforts to serve the country. Army Minister Araki's opinion is very noteworthy. Originally, the military opposed political parties and their financial backers. When Saito and Takahashi invited Suzuki to join the cabinet, Araki advised Saito not to succumb to political parties, even if it meant a war. Major General Tanaka Kunishige, president of the Meirin Association, also advised Saito not to cooperate with political parties, and if political parties dared to cause trouble, he would be willing to support the government. In this environment, cooperation between the Seiyukai and the government seemed difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Unexpectedly, both the military and financial departments expressed satisfaction. The shift in the Japanese political atmosphere is to increase its strength to resist foreign countries. The following remarks made by Army Minister Araki are worthy of attention by both Chinese and foreigners: Although I have not read the policies proposed by President Suzuki, the meeting between the three party leaders and Saito is an undeniable fact. It is difficult to predict the outcome. The trend of the political situation has passed a new stage. No matter who is in this increasingly urgent situation, they should have considerable awareness, abandon all private rights, and look at the Prime Minister's determination. It is also possible to understand that all cabinet members are running the country with sincerity and enthusiasm. There will be considerable achievements in three months. (30th Chinese Union Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Opportunities for Party Liaison Unripe</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai presented a general outline of its policies to the Minseito Party and the Kokumin Domei yesterday (the same as those presented to the government), aiming to create opportunities for party liaison. However, the Minseito Party did not attach importance to this matter. Secretary-General Egita claimed that even if the Seiyukai proposed setting up a joint political affairs investigation agency, our party would never agree. Therefore, the general trend of the Minseito Party is that it cannot readily follow the Seiyukai's persuasion. Therefore, although the Seiyukai is negotiating with them, there is little chance of it being realized. In fact, there are those within the Minseito Party who advocate liaison and have the same views as the Seiyukai. There have been repeated meetings. Once the political season arrives this autumn, there is a possibility that opportunities will develop rapidly. However, the Kokumin Domei, on the one hand, takes economic control as its fundamental policy, so its policies are different from those of the Seiyukai. It has already stated that it cannot agree. Yesterday, when the Seiyukai representative met with President Adachi, he added that the Seiyukai expects that there will be times in the future when it will have to oppose the government. Please understand the Minseito Party and the Kokumin Domei. These words have profound meaning. (30th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sugimura to Come to China Soon</h3>
<p>With Important Mission</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida formally ordered Minister Sugimura Yotaro to go to China and Manchuria. However, Minister Sugimura seems to have no formal mission on the surface. In fact, he is opening up the policy towards China, so he will depart from Tokyo on September 10, first to Manchuria, then to North China, Central China, and South China. He is scheduled to tour for about two and a half months. However, now that Dr. Lytton is coming to China from the League of Nations, and the relationship between China and the League of Nations will be close after Song Ziwen returns to China, it is noteworthy that Minister Sugimura, who has a deep relationship with the League of Nations, is also coming to China at this time.

<h3>Russia Shifts Diplomatic Strategy</h3>
<p>Germany Has Accelerated It</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times published an editorial commenting on Soviet diplomacy, saying, "The communist system has encountered unsolvable difficulties. Because of poverty, it has to make concessions to farmers. What the Soviet Union needs most is peace and security, followed by financial and economic assistance. Therefore, it has successively concluded non-aggression treaties with the Baltic coastal countries Poland and France. It is also discussing the same treaty with Italy. Its trust in Poland is extremely strong. Some people believe that a lasting understanding between Russia and Poland can be achieved. All of this is mostly due to Germany. The sudden change in Soviet diplomacy has been accelerated by errors in German policy," and so on. (29th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Report Soviet Russia Increases Troops on Border</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information received by the Japanese military, it is a fact that Soviet Russia has recently concentrated a large army on the Russian-Manchukuo border. Its troop strength is more than half of the total strength of the Japanese army. The air force has more than 300 heavy bombers and other excellent aircraft. According to Japanese observations, Soviet Russia has signed non-aggression treaties with Western neighboring countries such as Poland. Due to the political relations between European countries such as France, Germany, and Hungary, the western border can be secured. Therefore, it has moved its troops to the eastern border to contain the disputes over the Sino-Soviet Railway negotiations and the Far Eastern atmosphere after the Sino-Japanese cessation agreement. The Japanese military authorities are paying close attention to the actions of the Russian army with great determination. (30th Japan Union Dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. Government Revises Gold Ban</h3>
<p>Permits New Mine Gold to be Shipped Abroad</p>
<p>Private Gold Holdings Under Treasury Control</p>
<p>Hyde Park – President Roosevelt today, via executive order, revised the gold ban, permitting newly mined gold to be transported abroad under the strict supervision of the Treasury Department. Simultaneously, all privately held gold in the country will be placed under the control and supervision of the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Hyde Park – President Roosevelt today abolished a portion of the ban on gold exports, permitting the Treasury Department to receive and the Reserve Banks to handle sales of new U.S. mined gold. He also decreed that those holding gold coins, bars, and certificates must report the amount held within two weeks, along with the reasons why currency could not be substituted. This lifting of the ban gives U.S. mining companies the opportunity to obtain higher prices. U.S. gold will primarily be sold to foreign buyers, then to those with licenses for gold use in the arts, industry, or professions. The sale price will be determined by the Treasury Department after considering transportation and insurance costs, etc., and must be equal to the best price available in the open global gold market. Regulations will permit the Treasury Department to issue licenses for those using gold for foreign trade or withdrawing cash from domestic banks, except for amounts under one hundred dollars. Anyone or any group, except for Reserve Banks, must obtain a license to use cash. After thirty days, no one is allowed to hoard gold coins, bars, or certificates, with penalties of ten thousand dollars and ten years in prison for violations. This order to relax the ban was suddenly announced today as the President left the White House by automobile. After this news spread, gold mining stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange rose sharply. Domestic gold stocks rose fifteen dollars, reaching a new record of over three hundred dollars, while others rose one to three dollars. The Treasury Department expects the U.S. gold mining industry to profit an additional fifteen million dollars per year as a result, and the resumption of business activity is expected. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Government Controls Gold Management – According to a statement from the White House in Summer time, this order does not permit the free circulation of gold, nor will it affect the government's gold reserves. According to the order, mine owners wishing to export newly produced gold must report to the Treasury Department. After reviewing the situation and deeming export permissible, the Federal Reserve Bank will handle the export on behalf of the mine owners, and after deducting transportation and insurance costs, etc., will return the proceeds to the mine owners. Therefore, the Treasury Department not only retains the right to purchase newly produced gold at the official price of $20.67 per ounce, but also has the power to approve or deny exports. Mine owners who wish to sell gold abroad must not only entrust the government with sales, but cannot independently decide on the amount to be sold. Furthermore, this order does not permit the establishment of a free trading market, nor does it diminish the government's control over gold.</p>
<p>Intended to Support the Gold Mining Industry – The government's intention in issuing this order is to support the gold mining industry, as the current overseas gold price is approximately nine dollars higher per ounce than the U.S. official price. Consequently, the industry has been advocating for permission to export newly produced gold for over a month. According to the industry's views, there are two factions: one, the so-called National Committee, advocates for establishing a free trading market in New York; the other, the American Mining Congress, believes that while a free market would benefit the industry, allowing the export of newly produced gold is closer to the government's monetary and recovery plans. Before issuing this order, the U.S. President consulted with both factions and adopted the export permission method.</p>
<p>Resisting British Monetary Policy – However, according to prominent bankers, the effect of this order is not only to encourage the gold mining industry. Since the beginning of July, Europe has repeatedly withdrawn huge amounts of gold from the United States. In the week ending August 5th alone, the gold shipped by the New York Reserve Bank to France was worth over 41 million dollars. The amount shipped to Czechoslovakia was also worth over 6 million dollars. Bankers are baffled by the fact that Czechoslovakia could have so much earmarked gold existing in the United States. Even the gold earmarked in New York for France is not numerous. The reason seems to be that Britain intends to assist the currency of European gold standard countries. Since setting up the Exchange Equalisation Account, Britain has had huge amounts of earmarked gold existing in New York. Although the government does not announce the amount shipped abroad, it is rumored that at least 140 million dollars have been exported recently, while imports are minimal. The government's permission for the export of newly produced gold is intended to replace this outflow of gold, which is killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Gold Product Exports Restricted – Although there is a clause in today's executive order permitting the export of gold manufactured goods, a second order was issued placing this type of export under strict government control. It stipulates that the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service has full power to supervise all private gold holdings nationwide. For example, goldsmiths must report the amount of gold purchased from the government and the amount of gold jewelry and goldware manufactured to the Internal Revenue Service on a regular basis and be subject to inspection. Internal Revenue Service personnel can also prevent the domestic transportation or export of privately held gold coins and bars. Therefore, private gold hoarders will also be subject to strict government supervision.</p>
<p>Believed to Have Inflationary Effects – The impact of this order is not yet very apparent today. Those involved in securities trading seem to believe it has inflationary effects, so today's stock market is firm and prices are rising. In addition, commentators have different opinions. Inflationists claim it has inflationary effects, while others believe this claim is unfounded. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S. Recovery Machine Picks Up Speed</h3>
<p>Government Stores Huge Funds for Application</p>
<p>(Washington) – President Roosevelt's grand machine for national recovery is now accelerating its movement, aiming to achieve his work of injecting momentum into American agriculture and industry. At this time, the U.S. authorities have trillions of dollars stored for application. The largest expense is the $300 million public works program, while the smallest expense is the National Recovery Act, which is currently allocating only $250,000 from the $20.5 million in temporary emergency funds issued by the Treasury Department since July. The Treasury Department stores over $100 million in cash daily to cover the costs of recovery movements and ordinary administrative expenses across the country. To date, the Public Works Administration has spent a total of $120 million on construction matters. (29th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Encouraging Purchasing Movement</h3>
<p>Ford Refuses to Comply with Industry Regulations</p>
<p>Administrative Director Issues Warning</p>
<p>(Washington) – The latest scene in the recovery program is a large-scale movement to encourage people to buy now. According to some, if the current greatest efforts are unsuccessful, the recovery program will require supplementary plans such as inflation policies. General Johnson, the executor of the Recovery Act, proposed that purchasers could purchase goods worth 200 million dollars. It is estimated by General Johnson that 2 million unemployed people have regained work. Although national wages have increased by $30 million per week as a result, the full success of the recovery will only be achieved in two or three months. However, the number of people who have regained work today is far below estimates. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) – Today, automobile magnate Ford refused to comply with the automobile industry regulations approved by the government yesterday, claiming that the wages he pays are better than those stipulated in the industry regulations, and seeking to avoid government supervision and control. Ford is the first person to resist the recovery plan, so the news shocked everyone in Washington. National Industrial Recovery Administrator Johnson immediately warned Ford, making it clear that the masses should not be offended and indicating that if Ford does not quickly repent, he will list the Ford Company and its affiliated companies on the blacklist and immediately order all national government procurement agencies not to purchase its products. Today, a commemoration of recovery administration was held, with over 10,000 people participating in the parade, including many soldiers and sailors. (29th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Handling the Aftermath of the Chahar Situation</h3>
<p>Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang Maintain a Strong Stance</p>
<p>Issuing a Circular Telegram Declaring Continued Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Fang Goes to Dushikou, Unsuccessful in Meeting Song</p>
<p>Duolun Lost Again, Chaotic Situation in Eastern Chahar</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: Regarding the handling of the aftermath of the Chahar situation, Song Zheyuan, after discussing the plan with He Yingqin and others in Beiping, returned to Chahar to implement it. There are three major principles regarding the reorganization of the army: (1) Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, and others will be given other titles and leave the army; (2) the troops of Fang, Ji, and other troops of Feng will be reduced in size and led by secondary generals; (3) all volunteer armies that have been reviewed and given titles by the military branch will be restored to their original structure. Under these three major principles, the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province was started. Therefore, a specific plan was decided: (1) Fang Zhenwu will be given a title in the Military Affairs Commission or sent abroad with severance pay. His troops will be divided into three parts. Except for the two units of Bao Gang and Zhang Renjie, which will be reorganized separately, Fang's newly recruited troops will be reduced to two regiments, led by Ruan Xuanwu, who will be appointed as the commander of the Shangdu Garrison; (2) Ji Hongchang will be given the titles of military advisor and consultant to the Chahar Provincial Government, leaving the army. His troops will be reduced to two regiments, led by Zhang Yunrong, who will be appointed as the commander of the Zhangbei Garrison; (3) Zhang Renjie's unit of more than 10,000 people will be reorganized into the Provisional Third Division; (4) The old troops of Deng Wen, led by Tan Zixin, will be restored to the title of the 10th Cavalry Division; (5) Li Zhongyi's unit will be reorganized into the 24th Brigade, and Liu Zhendong's unit will be reorganized into the 25th Cavalry Brigade; (6) Liu Guitang's unit will be reorganized into a guerrilla force, and Liu will be appointed as the commander of the Eastern Chahar Guerrilla; (7) Sun Liangcheng's unit will be reorganized into two regiments under the control of Song, and Sun himself will be given another title. After Song returned to Chahar, he convened a meeting in Zhangjiakou with all parties concerned. The representatives from the military branch were Jiang Bocheng and Xiong Bin. The miscellaneous troops present were Ruan Xuanwu, Zhang Renjie, Tan Zixin, Li Zhongyi, Liu Zhendong, Sun Liangcheng, Zhang Yunrong, Tang Juwu, and representatives of Liu Guitang. Fang and Ji did not attend, and Ruan Xuanwu and Zhang Yunrong represented them. Pang Bingxun arrived in Zhang from Xuanhua. It is said that as a result of the meeting, most of the miscellaneous army generals agreed to the established plan. Ruan Xuanwu and Zhang Yunrong also indicated that they could accept the title of garrison commander. Sun Liangcheng tried his best to declare that he was willing to hand over military power and would no longer hold any title. However, Fang and Ji were tough in their attitude, so Ruan Xuanwu and Zhang Yunrong were recommended to separately persuade Fang and Ji. Zhang and Ruan left Zhang on the 25th with a mission and then received a telegram reporting that it was difficult to get to the point. Based on this, Song Zheyuan believed that the Japanese and puppet troops had invaded Duolun, and the situation in eastern Chahar was tense. He urgently sought to resolve internal problems as soon as possible to deal with foreign enemies together. Therefore, he decided to move the meeting place and personally went to Zhangbei to meet with Fang and Ji to discuss matters, following the example of the Shacheng meeting. Beforehand, he also sent a telegram to Fang and Ji, and Fang replied that he dared not trouble him. After receiving the telegram, Song still held a twelve-point enthusiasm and insisted on going. So on the afternoon of the 26th, at 1:00 PM, he, together with Xiao Zhenying and others, went to Zhangbei by car. However, before Song arrived, Fang led his guards and left Zhangbei first. Song arrived at 4:00 PM and saw that Fang had left. He immediately telegraphed Kangbao and Baochang to inquire and arrange a meeting, but Fang did not go there and his whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, Fang's whereabouts became erratic. It was not until tonight (27th) that a report was obtained, saying that Fang had gone to Dushikou, while Ji Hongchang was at Daqinggou. Song will temporarily stay in Zhangbei and still try to meet with Fang and Ji. If he is sure that he cannot meet them, he will return to Zhangjiakou and look for other ways. It is said that when Fang left Zhangbei, he issued a joint circular telegram declaring that he would continue to resist Japan, and his attitude was very firm. The various units of Fang and Ji are still holding high the banner of resisting Japan and have joined forces with Liu Guitang's unit to form a new front, which may be difficult to resolve satisfactorily for a while.</p>
<p>The puppet army of Li Shouxin re-entered Duolun a few days ago, but did not advance. However, Guyuan was invaded by Tang Yulin's troops again. Tang sent his chief of staff, Wang Hongru, to Zhangjiakou to explain his difficulties and request to be incorporated. On the other hand, he has close ties with the puppet army, which is the same attitude taken by Liu Guitang at the beginning of his entry into Chahar. Now, the puppet army in eastern Chahar is intermingled with the anti-Japanese army that automatically raised the banner, and the situation is even more chaotic than before. It is extremely difficult to clean up. The authorities, on the one hand, are holding a policy of appeasement and adopt a strategy of appeasement and pacification. On the other hand, they are deploying considerable forces to make the necessary preparations to secure the border. In addition to the original troops entering Chahar, Song's Feng division has all been concentrated in Zhangjiakou. Recently, Zhao Dengyu's division stationed in Shijiazhuang was transferred to Chahar. Zhao's troops arrived in Zhang today and transferred to Wanquan to take over the defense, and will advance forward in turn. (Dispatch from August 27th)</p>

<h3>Chiang Orders the Provinces Suppressing Bandits to Genuinely Organize the Baojia System</h3>
<p>Cultivating the Basic Military Force of the People</p>
<p>Employing Gentry to Establish Local Corps</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang believes that the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan, which are suppressing bandits, have been handling the Baojia system for years, often only seeking the appearance of completeness and not the implementation of the spirit, thus making the bandit suppression work completely entrusted to the army, and both political and civil power have failed. Now, a special plan for reorganizing the Baojia system and eliminating scattered bandits has been formulated, ordering the commanders-in-chief of all routes, all commanders, and the provincial governments to seriously improve the general shortcomings pointed out, cultivate the basic military force of the people, and follow the examples of Zeng and Hu to employ local gentry to handle local corps to assist the military and political forces where they cannot reach. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"It has been several years since the provinces have been handling the Baojia system. Examining its effectiveness, it is truly minimal. Examining the reasons, there are several points. First, there is no distinction between the urgency and the progress of the Baojia system. The Baojia regulations seem to be based on general situations on the surface, but in reality, the tasks of the Baojia chiefs and the strong men's teams are divided into normal and emergency situations. During the military progress, the urgency should be considered according to the time and place, and the measures should be different. For example, in the recovered areas, the Qingxiang (clearing the villages) should be carried out first. After the Qingxiang is somewhat successful, the self-defense should be organized. After the self-defense is sound, the Baojia system will be easy to organize and succeed. If the same steps are taken in different environments, it will inevitably be square pegs in round holes, and how can it be effective? Second, the methods of organizing the Baojia system are not flexible. The procedure for organizing the Baojia system should be to first organize the Baojia, select the Baojia chief, then stipulate the tasks, clear the population, formulate regulations, and compile the strong men, step by step. However, in the newly recovered bandit areas, the rural areas are destroyed, the people are displaced and have not returned, and the Baojia chiefs cannot be determined suddenly. An emergency organization should be implemented first for the existing people, and corresponding tasks should be assigned separately. After the local order is restored, the regulations should be followed and reorganized. The military should be assisted by the people's strength, and the politics should be able to advance side by side with the military. If the formal production of the Baojia chief is awaited before the preparation is made, the local order will not be restored for a day, and the Baojia system will not be completed for a day, that is, no one will be responsible for the place for a day, and it will be too late to waste things, and it will be difficult to achieve the effect of military-civilian cooperation. Third, the tasks of the Baojia system are not enforced effectively. The tasks of the Baojia system are originally to unite the people to resist foreign insults and clear the population to eliminate internal traitors, such as assisting the military police in searching and arresting bandits, building bunkers and roads, inspecting incoming and outgoing pedestrians, teaching the residents, and monitoring reactionaries. The Baojia regulations stipulate in detail, but the local governments do not understand the location of the tasks, only seek the appearance of completeness, and do not emphasize the implementation of the spirit. Often, the household registration is completed and the investigation is completed, and the gong can be assembled to be considered excellent performance. The viewpoint is already wrong, how can it be effective? To sum up these points, the essence of organizing the Baojia system is to revitalize the people's morale and eliminate bandits, but the enforcement is not effective, so that the bandit suppression work is completely entrusted to the army. If the army completely eliminates the bandits, then the Baojia system will never have a time to start, and both political and civil power will lose their effectiveness. Thinking of this, the future of bandit suppression is deeply worried. A special plan for reorganizing the Baojia system and eliminating zero bandits has been formulated, dividing the progress steps into three areas: Qingxiang, self-defense, and Baojia. In each area, the urgency is weighed, the main tasks are distributed, the key points of guiding the application of laws and regulations are stipulated, the deadline for implementation is stipulated, and the examples of Zeng (Guofan) and Hu (Linxiang) are followed to employ the gentry to handle the local corps to assist the military and political forces where they cannot reach. It is hoped that the military and political chiefs at all levels will learn from the past and deeply understand, supervise and urge the gentry and people to implement it earnestly, so as to achieve the effect of 30% military and 70% political. Do not treat it as a mere formality and repeat the same mistakes, causing delays. In addition to the separate orders, the plan is urgently sent to O copies, ordering them to follow, and to transfer and urge the subordinates to follow the same. This is the order."</p>
<h3>Fujian and Guangdong Negotiate on Jointly Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>丨The 19th Route Army Sends Representatives to Guangdong丨</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The bandits in western Fujian recently captured Liancheng with the intention of seizing food. After the 19th Route Army advanced to suppress them, they repeatedly annihilated the bandits in the Mingkou area. The 60th and 78th Divisions have now approached the bandit area. The 78th Division Commander Qu Nian led two regiments on the 19th and recovered Xijiang. Recently, the 19th Route Army, in view of the impending large-scale offensive, needs to contact the friendly forces on the Guangdong border in order to achieve the effect of suppression. Therefore, Lin Zhuliang, the Chief of Staff of the 78th Division, was specially sent to Guangdong to negotiate everything with the Guangdong authorities. Lin arrived in the province on the 24th to discuss the matter of jointly suppressing bandits and coordinating with the Guangdong authorities, and requested that the military be sent 300,000 yuan in assistance for August. At the same time, he requested that the Guangdong authorities allow the recruitment of new soldiers for the 78th Division in Luoding and Yunnan counties in the West River to supplement the division. According to Lin, the defenses in western Fujian are now extremely solid. Cai Tingkai is in Longyan supervising the front line with three or four divisions of troops. Lu Xingbang's troops are stationed in Yong'an. Zhang Junsong's troops from the 234th Brigade of the Qu Division and Ma Hongxing's troops are deployed in the Anxi area. The 23rd Brigade of Yun Yinglin's troops has recently moved to Zhangping. Therefore, large armies are now gathered in the southwest of Fujian, and as soon as the opportunity arrives, the order to launch a general offensive will be given.</p>
<p>On the southern Jiangxi front, the bandits have recently attacked the defense areas of the official army in Sannan in order to contain the Guangdong troops supporting Fujian. On the 19th, about 700 bandits from the pseudo-7th, 8th, and guerrilla teams of Junmenling suddenly attacked the Hukeng defense line of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Army. The Wang Regiment of the unit sent out two battalions to fight head-on, killing more than 200 bandits before dispersing the bandits. In this battle, the female captain of the pseudo-8th Guerrilla Plainclothes Team, Weng Xiaozhen, was captured, along with seven male and female bandits. On the same day, more than a thousand bandits from the pseudo-20th Division gathered, along with a part of the pseudo-Worker Division, and were forced by the official army to flee to the highlands in the Xiaole and Yi areas, confronting Zhang Meixin's unit of the 4th Division of the official army. That morning, Li's regiment of Zhang's division advanced from Banshi to Shihou, and Kong's regiment advanced to the highlands in the eastern end of Xiaole, encircling the pseudo-20th Division. The bandits used machine guns and hand grenades to charge, and their momentum was very fierce. The two sides engaged in melee combat for an hour. Zhang's division increased the Xie battalion to the left wing, and the Li and Zhou battalions increased the right side, and the entire line simultaneously pounced, finally killing more than 300 bandits. The remaining bandits could not hold on and fled in disarray towards the Gaopai of Shuidong, leaving behind more than a hundred corpses, and the situation was extremely embarrassing.

<h3>Key News of Bandit Suppression in Fujian and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>丨Frontline News from the Second Column of the Southern Route丨</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Huang Renhuan, the commander of the Guangdong Army's Independent 1st Division, is currently the commander of the Second Column of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army. The division headquarters is located in Jiaoling, and a rear office is located in Shantou. Yesterday, the rear office forwarded the information obtained from the front line to the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office, as summarized below:</p>
<p>In western Fujian: (1) Deng Shizeng telegraphed from Longyan that the bandits disturbing western Fujian are the pseudo-3rd Army Corps of Peng Dehuai and the pseudo-1st Division of Luo Binghui of the pseudo-1st Army Corps. On the morning of the 9th, the bandits arrived at Meicun, north of Longyan County, with about three to four thousand people. Most of them gathered at Xihu, south of Liancheng. There were only seven or eight hundred bandits in Liancheng. (2) Zeng Youren Brigade of Huang Renhuan's unit in Shanghang reported that there are dozens of Red Guards in Lufeng, and two to three hundred local communists in Huanggang and Huangtan. On the 7th, they fled to Huangjiadu. There are no bandit gangs in Dachaotou, Jiaoling. There are seven or eight thousand bandits in the Longyanggu area bordering Changting. They are now near Long, transporting civilian grain to Changting. Also, the pseudo-24th Division arrived in Baisha, Changting on the 9th. According to Shanghang merchants from Changting, there are more than a thousand bandits in Tingcheng, and the guns are not very good. The bandits ordered that the grain in Long Guanzhuang be moved to Tingcheng, and more than three hundred piculs of Nanyang warehouse grain were moved. (3) Zhang Yan's unit stationed in Lanjia Ferry and Fengren City in Yongding withdrew to Longyan on the morning of the 10th, leaving only Huang Tiehan's regiment to defend Yongding City. The Qu Shounian Division has now retreated to Yongding for reorganization. (4) Yan Yingyu Brigade of Huang Renhuan's unit stationed in Wuping reported that a part of the independent regiment of the pseudo-Independent 2nd Division arrived at Yongpingzhai, north of Wuping, on the 8th, and they came from Zhongzhao.</p>
<p>In southern Jiangxi: (1) Huang Zhiwen's division telegraphed from Xunwu that the pseudo-Model Division, the pseudo-23rd Division, and the pseudo-Independent 3rd Division fled north from Shuiyuan Longgang to Qingxi Yan. The pseudo-Independent Division was formed by local communists in Anyuan and is still lurking in Anyuan. The pseudo-Model Division fled back to Huichang. Only the pseudo-23rd Division is in Anyuan. After the second battle, more than half of the losses were lost. There are a few red guerrilla teams in Qingxi, Junmenling, and Pangu Pass, checking pedestrians. The Soviet of Xunwu Chengjiang Wei has more than 100 of the pseudo-Independent 3rd Division扎磁溪. The bandits who retreated from Anyuan to Junmenling were said to have gone to Fujian. (2) Zhang Meixin's division telegraphed from Anyuan that there were two or three thousand of the pseudo-Model Division in Qingxi, and more than a thousand bandits in Junmenling. The pseudo-Model Division and the pseudo-23rd Division had more than seven thousand. When the bandits defeated and returned to Tianxin Wei in Junmenling on the evening of the 10th, they ordered each person in the nearby townships to send five liters of rice, and claimed that there would be eight or nine divisions of people arriving soon. Also, the heavy stone, Shuidong, and Gaopai all had bandits who forced the people to collect grain and rice. At present, the counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou have announced martial law due to the rampant banditry in Fujian and Jiangxi, and are checking pedestrians and post and telecommunications day and night.

<h3>Hanshan County Captured by Bandits</h3>
<p>Neighboring Counties are Extremely Nervous</p>
<p>Wuhu Sends Troops to Assist in Suppression</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Hanshan County, Anhui, is a large county with the most abundant agricultural production and developed commerce in southern Anhui. It is located across the river from Wuhu, only tens of miles away. However, on August 26, several hundred bandits suddenly fled to the first town near the county seat, Xianzong, from Hefei. It is said that the bandit leader is Zhang Dabizi, who harassed Hefei and Shucheng and other places. They confiscated all the guns from the town's security team and plundered the entire town with great momentum. The county seat was very nervous and sent a security team out of the city to block them. However, the bandits disguised themselves as farmers, carrying sickles and other things, posing as refugees, and heading towards the county seat. They packed pistols and other equipment into packages and hired many elderly rural women to carry them on their backs and mixed them into the city. After the bandits approached the city walls, they began to attack fiercely at 4:00 AM on the 27th. Due to the lack of troops in the city, it finally fell around 10:00 AM. After the bandits entered the city, many displaced people joined them and first negotiated with the gentry, demanding a large sum of cash. Because they could not cope, they immediately released about sixty prisoners and then divided into streets to search door to door, while firing guns to show their power, densely like a string of beads. Until the evening, they kidnapped about two hundred and several dozen men and women hostages and retreated to the Xianzong Town and Huangshan Temple area. On the way, they released about a hundred hostages. However, it was heard that the wife and children of County Magistrate Wu Yinghan were all kidnapped, and the total loss reached tens of thousands of yuan. After this battle, the bandits captured a lot of guns and equipment, so the number of people also increased to more than a thousand. They spread the red army flag, and the surrounding counties, such as Chaoxian, Hexian, and Quanjiao, were all panicked. People fled to safe areas, and more people from Hanshan came to Wuhu to escape. In particular, Chaoxian County was in very critical situation. Wang Xianbao Zhai, the Administrative Inspector of the Second District of Wuhu, in addition to transferring a part of the first, third, and second companies of the security team to Chaoxian to assist in the blockade, also telegraphed the central government to quickly send large troops to suppress them to avoid spreading.

<h3>Hunan Province Piloting Cooperative Farms for Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Allocates Two Thousand Acres of Official Wasteland</p>
<p>Aims to Provide Suitable Occupations for All Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since the effective commencement of the year, the various divisions directly under the Central Government have mostly been formed by personnel recruited in Hunan. Therefore, there is no division without Hunanese. Currently, recruitment offices are still everywhere in Hunan. Vehicles transporting newly recruited soldiers are constantly on the road. Soldiers have become a special product of Hunan. In the event of casualties, the military authorities merely issue an order regarding the education of the wounded and the pensions for the deceased, with the entire burden falling on Hunan Province. He Jian once established the Fourth Route Army Disabled Soldiers' Rehabilitation Center in Xiangtan, which takes in disabled soldiers directly under He's Fourth Route Army, with funds drawn from national taxes. The Hunan Disabled Soldiers' Rehabilitation Center was established in Changsha, which takes in disabled soldiers sent back from various armies and divisions other than the Fourth Route Army, with funds drawn from provincial taxes. Currently, both rehabilitation centers are already full, and those who arrive later cannot be accommodated, leaving those turned away with no means of support. Each month, tens of thousands of dollars are spent on rehabilitation fees, but it only provides care and not education. In addition to eating without working, the wounded soldiers also have various special rights. All theaters, large and small, have special seats for wounded soldiers for their free entertainment. If citizens of Changsha have weddings, funerals, housewarmings, or birthday celebrations, the wounded soldiers will hold a red card, set off a string of firecrackers, and demand money. Each household is asked for a few dollars at a minimum, and tens of dollars at a maximum, not stopping until their goal is reached. The wounded soldiers have become a special class in Changsha society. As for pensions for the wounded and deceased, according to Chen Rujin, the director of the National Tax Revenue and Expenditure Office, who manages the allocation of pension funds from national taxes, the amount has been increasing year by year. In the 19th year of the Republic, only 134,044 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 fen were spent on pensions. In the 20th year, 438,028 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen were spent. In the 21st year, 504,975 yuan, 6 jiao, and 1 fen were spent. In the 22nd year, up to the end of June, it had increased to 800,693 yuan, 8 jiao, and 4 fen. Although there are no statistics for the amount of pension funds paid from provincial taxes, it is roughly equal to the national taxes. Furthermore, in the recent wars against Japan and the suppression of bandits, there have been even more casualties among Hunanese officers and soldiers. In the future, education and pensions will be even more complicated. Chen Rujin, who manages the national tax revenue and expenditure, believes that rather than spending large sums of money each month and letting them eat without working, it would be better to find a way to make them productive. He proposed to He Jian to pilot a cooperative farm for wounded soldiers. The provincial government would allocate two thousand acres of official wasteland to pilot one village first, with a temporary limit of fifty households, and then gradually expand. The required expenses would first be paid by the National Tax Office, and then deducted from the pensions due to the wounded soldiers, so that the wounded soldiers could gradually return to farming. He Jian considered it feasible and appointed Zhang Kailian, the Director of Finance, Yu Jichuan, the Director of Construction, Liu Yunsheng, the Director of the General Headquarters Medical Department, and Chen Rujin to actively prepare and agreed on a general outline of the plan as follows: (1) In order to provide suitable occupations for wounded soldiers and to turn pensions into productive uses, 20,000 yuan will be pre-allocated from the annual pension fund to pilot a cooperative farm for wounded soldiers. All wounded soldiers belonging to the Fourth Route Army who receive pensions annually from the national tax and who are physically able to farm and willing to return to farming, and approved by the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, may join the cooperative farm and cultivate land. (2) The land needed for the cooperative farm for wounded soldiers will be allocated two thousand acres of official wasteland by the Hunan Provincial Government. The start-up costs, as well as houses, farm tools, roads, ditches, will be paid in advance by the Customs Revenue and Expenditure Office. A separate budget will be drawn up in accordance with the cooperative system and recorded in the accounts of each wounded soldier. In the future, the wasteland will be cultivated and taxed according to law. The price of the land will be assessed according to the market price based on the amount of pension received by each wounded soldier. The land will be allocated accordingly, and the land price will be deducted from the pension due. Then, the government will separately issue management licenses to determine property rights. (3) All wounded soldiers who volunteer to return to farming must first be trained for six months in a designated agricultural vocational school or farm to acquire general agricultural knowledge before joining the cooperative farm. (4) In addition to ordinary crops, the cooperative farm for wounded soldiers should also focus on beekeeping, chicken farming, animal husbandry, and tree planting, so that wounded soldiers with incomplete limbs can also work. (5) The cooperative farm for wounded soldiers should organize production and consumer cooperatives separately. All purchases and sales, water conservancy projects, and new agricultural tools in the village should be operated in a cooperative manner. The regulations will be formulated separately. (6) All wounded soldiers who join the cooperative farm should live with their families to live and work in peace and be permanent. (7) The cooperative farm for wounded soldiers will be supervised and managed by a Hunan Wounded Soldiers Cooperative Farm Management Committee organized by one commissioner each from the Provincial Government, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, and the National Tax Revenue and Expenditure Office. (8) The staff handling the cooperative farm for wounded soldiers will be temporarily transferred from relevant agencies during the pilot period and will not be paid salaries. (9) During the pilot period, the cooperative farm for wounded soldiers will temporarily operate one village, limited to fifty households. It will be promoted when it is successful. The above are general points. The detailed plan is still under discussion. The official wasteland required is said to be allocated from the newly silted land inside the Linxiang Yongji Dike. It is decided to complete the preparations in the shortest possible time so that spring farming can be carried out next year. (August 20)</p>
<h3>Inspection Notes on Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei by Our Correspondent Ren An</h3>
<p>Cihua Town After Six Years of Banditry</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Yichun: The Ganxiang Road starts from Nanchang in the east and ends at Pingxiang in the west, with a length of about six hundred li. Although it has recently been opened to traffic, the crushed stone pavement has not been completed in many places, and the junctions between the bridge ends and the dirt roads often form ridges of one or two inches in height, causing the car to bump greatly. Passengers must hold on tightly to the seat board, and if they lose their grip, they will inevitably hit their heads on the roof of the car. When passing through the three rivers of Xujiadu, Luxi, and Yuanhe, because the bridges are currently under construction, passengers must hire a ferry to change vehicles and buy tickets separately, which is particularly troublesome.</p>
<p>Yichun, formerly known as Yuanzhou, is a city on the upper reaches of the Yuan River, surrounded by green mountains, and the scenery is pleasant. The county's output is sufficient to supply itself, and the distribution of land is generally even. There are very few landlords with more than one hundred acres of land. Self-cultivating farmers and semi-self-cultivating farmers account for the majority of farmers. Therefore, when the Red Peril spread to the surrounding areas in the 16th and 17th years of the Republic, Yichun was able to enjoy temporary peace, which is a good reason. Later, the officials and gentry were too optimistic and failed to take precautions, which led to the gradual growth of the Red Bandits. In the 18th year of the Republic, they dared to capture the city with only two hundred miscellaneous guns. Later, they took the opportunity to successively capture neighboring cities such as Fenyi, Wanzai, and Anfu. By the beginning of the 19th year, when they captured Yicheng again, their guns had increased to thousands. Peng Dehuai served as the commander and was quite unstoppable. After Peng's bandits withdrew, although the National Army was stationed there, their strength was only enough to defend the city. They had no time to take care of the surrounding areas, so important bandit nests such as Cihua Town (the location of the Red Bandit Yichun County Soviet) and Fengdingshan have not yet been completely recovered.</p>
<p>Cihua Town is located in the center of the Sixth District, which protrudes from a corner of the county's border. It is about one hundred and twenty li from the county seat and the borders of Fenyi, Wanzai, Liuyang, Pingxiang, and other counties. The banditry has been going on for almost six years, and the foundation seems to be relatively stable. The Eighteenth Division once attacked it, but then withdrew. Later, the Sixty-second Division recaptured it and severely punished its banditized soldiers and civilians, destroying its various constructions, such as the Soviet government, Lenin Elementary School, Mint, Cooperative, and Textile Factory. They rebuilt solid and tall watchtowers and various defensive fortifications. After the completion, the division, because the area was surrounded by mountains on all sides, making transportation difficult, and it was inconvenient to station heavy troops, transferred the guard duty to the carefully selected local militia, encouraging them to take on the difficulty. Currently, the bandit area surrounding Cihua is about one hundred li in diameter, and the area guarded by the local militia is only about four li in diameter. The required salt, rice, and bullets must be sent in by outside teams. The fortifications are often in danger of being counterattacked by the bandits. To avoid the intense shooting from the high ground by the defending troops, the bandits often cover their heads with wooden boards covered with cotton quilts and move forward, rushing towards the fortifications, stacking them to form ladders, and engaging in close combat. However, because of the unfavorable terrain and insufficient ammunition, they suffered heavy casualties and retreated in embarrassment. Ouyang, the head of the Sixth District, served in the bandit area for five years, and his family was almost completely killed by the bandits. He was not subdued and vowed not to coexist with them. At the time when the district head resigned due to an event and returned to the city, the reporter, because he had dealt with the bandits for a long time and should be more familiar with the bandit situation, was introduced by the county government to meet and talk. According to him, "The Red Peril has spread throughout the territory, and the Sixth District is particularly red. Since the initial recapture of Cihua, everything about the bandit party's meeting ceremonies, slogans, doctrines, and meanings, if asked of old men and children, they can answer fluently without being held guilty. The bandit army's organization is roughly divided into the Red Army, the Young Pioneers, the Red Guards, the Guerrilla Team, the Search Team (investigating local tyrants and secret agents), the Transportation Team (lurking in the countryside or setting up tea houses along the way to communicate with each other and spy on enemy information), the Spear Team (the task is roughly the same as the Guerrilla Team, but the weapons are mostly spears), and the Comfort Team (composed of young women, specializing in comforting the victory of various teams and inducing the enemy to surrender). The slogans used to lure the people to join the Red Army are mostly 'Joining the Red Army is to find a way out for our proletariat, and joining the White Army is to be a running dog for the bourgeoisie. Although we have no weapons, in the future all weapons will belong to us,' etc. The land policy is that regardless of men, women, old, or young, each person has twenty-five grabs (about one mu), and the rest belongs to the Soviet government. The type of crops to be planted and when to plant them must be obeyed. Those who are lazy will be severely punished. If a large number of Red Army soldiers come, each person must supply a sheng of grain. If they do not have enough to eat, they must do other work to make up for it. Men and women who are physiologically unsound or have hereditary diseases are not allowed to marry. Those who are not married but are suspected of cohabitation are sentenced. Those who commit financial fraud, even if the amount is only one yuan, are also sentenced to death. Those who privately bury money underground are also killed. The silver coins they mint are the same in style and weight as the large foreign coins on the market, but the quality is mostly melted jewelry, so the color is slightly green. The villagers do not know, and some occasionally use them. The life of the bandit army is already extremely difficult on weekdays. Now, in the face of encirclement and blockade, the predicament is even more extreme. From now on, the military and civilians will cooperate and work hard to advance and eliminate the bandits. The bandits will have nowhere to flee and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop," he said. (August 14)</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Train No. 9 Robbed by Bandits in Qingxian</p>
<p>Railway Police Officer Shot and Killed by Bandits</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: On the 27th, Jinpu Railway train No. 9 from Tianjin to Jinan was robbed by bandits in Qingxian, Hebei Province, at 8:30 pm. The loss was more than 400 yuan, not including clothing, etc. The train was originally scheduled to arrive in Jinan at 7:00 am today (the 28th), but it arrived at 11:00 am due to the robbery. The details of the robbery are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinpu Train No. 9 left Tianjin Nankai yesterday morning (the 27th) with locomotive No. 106, two guard cars, twelve freight cars, two third-class cars, and two iron boxcars. In addition to more than 300 passengers in the third-class passenger cars, it was also fully loaded with various goods. There were no other incidents along the way after leaving Tianjin. At 8:30 pm, when passing through Qingxian, Hebei Province, more than a dozen passengers dressed in plain clothes bought tickets and boarded the train. They entered the third-class car, and two of them went directly to the top of the freight car. No one paid attention to them. After passing the first flag station of Qingxian, two bandits climbed from the top of the freight car to the locomotive, took out their hidden handguns, and forced the driver to slow down. Five or six bandits simultaneously surrounded the security team in the second-class car. The escort team accompanying the train was the sixth members of the fifth team of Jinpu Railway Security Force, led by squad leader Zhang Mingxi, plus three passengers. It had two rifles. There were three people in the iron boxcar, also with only two rifles. The police in the third-class car, seeing the large number of bandits, were helpless. At that time, Liu Shicai, a railway police officer in the third-class passenger car, saw that the situation was critical and was about to draw his gun to shoot the bandits, but he was spotted by the bandits, who immediately shot him. The bullet passed through his chest and he died immediately. A passenger next to him also suffered a minor leg injury. After the railway police officer was killed, the bandits took his gun. The remaining police officers hid in the corners of the car and dared not intervene. Then, after passing the third flag station of Qingxian Station, the bandits suddenly fired three shots. As soon as the gunfire stopped, more than a dozen hidden bandits with guns boarded the train. It turned out that the bandits had ambushed a group of bandits by the roadside of the third flag station when they boarded the train in Qingxian. After the ambushing bandits boarded the train, they entered the third-class passenger car and, together with the bandits in the car, rummaged through boxes and chests, searching extensively. They searched for more than 400 yuan from all the passengers, and all the straw hats and gowns were seized. However, all the luggage was not taken away. At Sanji, the bandits gathered, shouted, and got off the train, changed into straw hats and gowns, and dispersed separately. After the bandits left, the train continued south. Liu Shicai's body was carried down at Xingji. The injured passenger also got off the train at Cangzhou. The fifth team also changed shifts, and squad leader Ji Deshun of the sixth security team led the team to escort the train. The train arrived in Jinan at 11:00 am today (the 28th). (August 28)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Workers Petition to the Instructor</h3>
<p>Zhang Jun Explains the Reason for the Establishment of the General Labor Union</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The labor movement in Wuhu has been stagnant for a long time. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Party Department suddenly announced the appointment of Yang Gancheng, Pan Renzhong, and seven others as organizing committee members of the Wuhu General Labor Union, and appointed Zhang Jun as the instructor of labor organizations. Zhang arrived here the day before yesterday. After the members of the organizing committee were appointed, they also prepared to start work. Yesterday, workers from the Yuzhong Yarn Factory, Qizihua Industry, Shoe Industry Outsourcing, South Bank Wharf, Rice Milling and Hulling Workshops, and other labor unions, after the announcement of the labor organizing committee, in addition to preparing a document to request higher authorities, especially led thousands of workers in a procession to the Southeast Hotel on Zhongshan Road to petition the instructor Zhang Jun. After Zhang responded to the public, he briefly stated that "The intentions of all the workers have been understood. The reason why the province established the General Labor Union this time is that Commander-in-Chief Chiang previously convened a meeting of the Party committees of four provinces in Lushan. Regarding mass organizations, he advocated practical training to revive the mass movement, so the Provincial Party Department urgently established the Wuhu General Labor Union. As for the organizing committee members who are not suitable, I will of course be responsible for submitting a request to the Provincial Party Department to replace them. Please trust and forgive everyone." Finally, all the workers shouted slogans and dispersed. (August 26)</p>

<h3>Martial Law Implemented in the Four Townships to Guard Against Bandits</h3>
<p>There have been disturbances by scattered bandits in the coastal areas of Tongyi, and bandits in the four townships have also been active recently. Because there were rumors that bandits were robbing police weapons, the county government ordered the police and local militia in each district to be on strict alert. The provincial water police team is responsible for inspecting all ports. The Provincial Security Regiment stationed in Tong, due to the unrest, has decided to launch a large-scale search and suppression.</p>

<h3>Impersonating a Military Officer to Widely Send Wedding Invitations Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>Zhou, who lives in Qinglong Lane in the city, recently had a whimsical idea and widely sent out wedding invitations, saying that his son was one year old and he would be hosting a banquet at home on the 31st of this month. The invitations included a photo of "Cadets of the Sixth Class of the Central Army Military Academy." The county magistrate, the director of the public security bureau, and various staff members were all on the list of those invited. After receiving the invitation, County Magistrate Zhou Heng believed that this must be a false name used to swindle and deceive, and ordered the Public Security Bureau to go to the address to arrest him. As a result, Zhou Yong, who was impersonating a military officer, was arrested, along with many congratulatory gifts and thank-you notes. Huang Cheng, the judge, opened a court for questioning. According to his confession, his name was Zhou Yong, also known as Zhou Yuanjin. He used to work in a rice shop and now sells radish pancakes. He has no wife or children. Because life was difficult, he resorted to this strategy and asked to be exempted from prosecution. The official Yu, considering that it was a first offense, leniently sentenced him to two months of imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Water Police Soldiers Commit Violence</h3>
<p>On the 26th, soldiers of the provincial public security team stationed in Ershilipu suddenly went to Cheluo Town for unknown reasons, arrested Li Wei, a reporter from the Huaihai News, and the mother of the town's mayor, beat them severely, and their lives were in danger. The merchants and residents of the entire town were extremely indignant at the team's illegal actions and went on strike on the 27th. Currently, the families have sent the victims to the county to examine their injuries and request that they be severely punished.</p>

<h3>Request to Stop Collecting Winter Grain Transport Surcharge</h3>
<p>The case of collecting two yuan per stone of grain transport in the winter in Jiangsu Province originated in the era of the warlord Sun Chuanfang. After the National Army established itself in Jiangnan, it was changed to a one-year limit and no longer collected. Unexpectedly, there have recently been moves to extend the collection. The Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, Relief Institute, Public Property Office, and other institutions, believing that at a time when people's livelihoods are declining and low grain prices are harming farmers, this collection should no longer be made to increase the burden on the people, sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Chairman of the Province on the 28th, requesting an immediate order to stop it in order to eliminate harsh levies.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Tramples Villager to Death While Arresting Gamblers</h3>
<p>Wang Xuehan, a patrol officer from the Third Branch of the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in Hua Dafang Village, District 13 of the county, sent police chief Wang Baode and six police officers, including Zhu Yunshi, to arrest gamblers in Chen Xinggen's teahouse in Hetanqiao. They arrested two gamblers, He Dongyuan and others. Later, they went to the teahouse opened by Lu Runzhang in Yuanlongqiao to arrest gamblers and arrested three gamblers, Lu Sanduo and others, and took them to the station. Unexpectedly, during the arrest, they trampled the villager Zhao Xinggen to death. When Officer Wang learned of this, he sent the police officer, along with the gamblers, to the Eighth Branch, and Chief Liu sent them to the County Public Security Bureau yesterday. At the same time, Tu Zheng came to the city to report to the County Court, requesting that someone be sent to examine the body for verification and handling.</p>
<h3>Kiln Industry Asks to Be Exempted from Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Brick and Tile Kiln Industry Association of the county, as well as the Linong Brick and Tile Company, Gongda Brick Factory, and Yunli Lime Factory, etc., due to the Jiangsu Lime, Brick, and Tile Kiln Business Tax, the Wuxi Collection Office of the Third District collects business tax according to the estimated turnover, temporarily charging 5% of the interest rate of two cents, which is more than four times higher than the original 0.5% of the capital amount. Moreover, regardless of whether the goods produced have been sold or shipped from the factory, the tax is based on the output as the tax standard. It is called business tax, but in reality, it is even harsher than the factory tax. The industry cannot bear the burden, so yesterday they jointly sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be forwarded to the Department of Finance to order the collection office to exempt them from the tax in order to maintain a glimmer of livelihood, and also requested that it be forwarded to the Department of Construction for assistance.</p>

<h3>Bandits Intercept and Rob Night Boats</h3>
<p>The night boat from Linpu to Kanshan set sail from Kanshan on the 27th, fully loaded with goods, and returned to Linshan. When it reached Tingtou Bridge near Suoqian, at dawn, nine bandits suddenly came, fired shots, and ordered the boat to stop. They jumped into the cabin and carried out a wanton robbery, stealing more than 40 yuan of silver, and many items of clothing from the boat crew.</p>
<h3>Merchants in Southern Township Plan to Set Up a Paper Mill</h3>
<p>Shen Qizhou, a merchant from Tangcunban Village in Southern Township of Xiaoshan, has been an assistant manager in a paper mill in Shanghai. Recently, he saw that the paper troughs in Wu Xiao are all adhering to the old methods and do not know how to improve, so that foreign paper is imported and the sales of local paper are declining day by day. In order to recover the rights and interests and revitalize domestic products, Shen has decided to open an improved paper mill in his village. He specializes in imitating various kinds of foreign paper and is currently consulting with nearby paper troughs in order to raise shares to open the mill.</p>

<h3>Request for Exemption from Winter Grain Transport Surcharge</h3>
<p>Yiyi was forced to borrow one year of winter grain transport during the time when Sun Chuanfang was the governor of Jiangsu. In the winter of the 19th year of the Republic, it continued to be collected in the name of the Northern Expedition. With the approval of Ye Chuqia's administration of Jiangsu, a surcharge of two yuan per stone of grain transport was collected for a period of one year. The people endured the pain and paid it off. In the 20th and 21st years, it was continued to be collected again by analogy. Up to now, it has not been exempted. If this continues year after year, it will inevitably become a permanent land tax surcharge. At a time when there have been frequent years of famine and the rural areas are bankrupt, it is difficult to cope with the regular tax, let alone the extra surcharges. Therefore, the County Organizing Committee, the Chamber of Commerce, the Journalists Association, the Farmers Association, the Education Association, the Public Property Management Office, the Education Bureau, and Zhu Zhongjing, the district heads of all fourteen districts in the county, sent a telegram to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance on August 29, appealing to them to quickly order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to permanently stop the collection of grain surcharges and not continue to collect them by analogy, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<h3>Two Bandits Shot Dead While Resisting Arrest</h3>
<p>In Taiyang Township, Daixi, Southern Township of Huzhou, there was a farmer named Zhang Jianmao, whose family was well-off, which was coveted by bandits. Unexpectedly, at about 11 pm the day before yesterday, a number of bandits speaking Hakka suddenly came, each holding a handgun, broke into the house, and carried out a large-scale robbery, stealing eight carts of fine silk, one Dao gun, and clothing and jewelry, etc., causing great losses. The Second Regiment of the Huzhou Security Team stationed in Daixi learned of this and immediately ordered ten soldiers from the team to rush to pursue and arrest the bandits. The bandits opened fire to resist, and the soldiers also returned fire. After about an hour, the bandits were unable to hold out and fled in all directions. Two bandits, Zhang Dezhu and Qian Dedang, were shot dead on the spot, and all the stolen goods were recovered.</p>
<h3>Two Women Fight and Cause a Death</h3>
<p>Wang Jiang, a woman from Daixi Town, had a verbal argument with Yang Shi, also from the town, a few days ago, which led to a fight between the two. Wang Jiang was seriously injured by Yang Shi and died on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The family of the deceased reported to the police station in the town. After receiving the report, Director Ruan ordered the police to arrest Yang Shi and telegraphed the Wuxing Court for an examination. The court sent a prosecutor to the scene yesterday with police officers. The examination found that the deceased had indeed died from injuries, and the Eighth Branch of the town escorted Yang Shi to Huzhou for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Two Grand Banquets Hosted for Finance Minister Song Upon Return from Overseas</h3>
<p>Twenty-Five Groups Hosted a Luncheon Banquet</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Also Held a Tea Party in the Evening</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai on the President Jefferson the day before yesterday. All sectors of the city, because Song has traveled far and wide for the country, organized a welcome back convention for Minister Song and hosted a luncheon banquet for Song at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday at around 12:00 pm. More than 40 representatives from all walks of life attended, and leaders from all walks of life gave very cordial welcome speeches. Song also gave a speech, which was broadcasted by wireless radio. At 5:00 pm, Mayor Wu held a tea party at the City Government Garden at 1881 Xiafei Road to welcome Song. Details are described as follows:</p>
<h3>Grand Banquets from All Sectors</h3>

The chief host was Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The venue was decorated at the gate of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, fully adorned with colorful flowers, and a ceremonial arch was erected, inscribed with the words "Shanghai All Sectors Welcome Minister Song's Return to the Country Meeting." After entering the gate, national flags and colorful paper were hung straight to the hall. In the middle of the hall hung a horizontal banner with the large characters "Shanghai All Sectors Welcome Minister Song's Return to the Country Meeting," and above it was a horizontal plaque with the four large characters "Laboring for the Country." The four walls were covered with various slogans, such as "Welcome Minister Song to realize his grand economic plan after returning to the country," "Welcome Minister Song's efforts in economic construction," "Welcome Minister Song, who defends against foreign aggression and saves the country," "Welcome Minister Song, who develops China's industry," and so on. National flags of various countries were hung in the middle. A horizontal table was set up in the venue for Minister Song and the accompanying guests, and the rest were straight rows of seats for the guests.</p>
<p>Stringent Security As for the security of the venue, the Municipal Public Security Bureau specially dispatched a team of armed police officers to the venue for protection, and the 642nd Boy Scout Regiment maintained order. Armed patrol officers stood at the gate, prohibiting idlers from entering. The Public Concession Police Department also specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to protect the area outside the venue.</p>

Westerners in the venue used broadcasting radios to broadcast the event, and many Chinese and Western photographers took photos of Mr. Song.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a welcome speech, saying, "When our association and others saw Minister Song off to the United States to attend the World Economic Conference, we once offered some suggestions, as the ancients did when they parted, thinking it would be helpful to support his profound insight. Time flies like an arrow, and in a blink of an eye, the conference closed. Our public has also completed the task, and the important position of agricultural minister should not be vacant for long, so he returned to the country with a flourish. This trip has made us feel that the international infighting is endless, and the so-called cooperation and coordination is still a kind of illusory ideal. Moreover, domestic border police and floods are coming one after another, making the rulers almost unable to have time to eat. We have been separated from you for several months, and as soon as we enter the country, we have not found any good news to comfort each other. This is something that all the people present should feel the same. Then, what is the meaning and feeling of today's grand meeting? We have to express it to Mr. Song and the guests present at this time. When our country was in the Qing Dynasty and Russia and Japan were fighting, there were many people who thought that China's weakness and the balance of power in the Far East were not easy to maintain. We should imitate the example of the Russian Emperor's appointment of foreign powers, and finally protect ourselves. We should send close and important ministers to travel around the world to change international views and connect international public opinion. Unfortunately, He Fei died early at that time, and no one among the Manchurian nobles could shoulder this important task. This proposal eventually fell through. The situation in which our country is today is a hundred times more difficult than in the Qing Dynasty. The reason is that Europe and the United States have many accidents and only want to protect themselves. The situation in the Far East has long lost its restraining effect. In this precarious situation, the national strength is not enough to defend itself. Therefore, struggling for survival still only seeks a way out in diplomacy. We read the history of Prussia and think that Prussia's unification of the whole of Germany, on the one hand, relied on Moltke's military strategy, and on the other hand, it also relied on Bismarck's use of diplomatic skills. At first, it allied with France to control Austria, and then it allied with Russia to frustrate France. All these situations are in the plan and need not be described in detail. Our country is far away in East Asia, and the situation does not have to be the same, but historical precedents are enough for people to refer to. Historically, diplomacy has been lost in dealing with things and lacking a consistent policy. Today, we must change this habit in order to protect ourselves. However, the decision of diplomatic policy must first be based on an accurate observation of the international situation. Therefore, it is not difficult to make a decision, but it is difficult to observe it correctly. Mr. Song took the opportunity to participate in the World Economic Conference, and his footprints have been all over the major countries in Europe, and he has been dealing with their important figures for several months. Therefore, this kind of diplomatic information cannot be collected by any capable minister. Although our country's diplomatic policy is determined by the Central Political Conference, the plan must be based on Mr. Song's information. If we compare it to sailing, we rely on you as the compass. Therefore, the fate of our country for the next few decades or hundreds of years is entrusted to the diplomatic policy after this, and the policy will not be confused in the trend, and it all depends on your good plan. Therefore, today our association held an unprecedented grand ceremony to welcome you back to the country, because this trip is entrusted by hundreds of millions of people, so the expectations are deep and sincere. In addition, the point of expectation is that our country's rural areas are bankrupt, and imports have exceeded about 300 million yuan in the first half of this year. The first place is still food, and the second place is still textiles. Domestic textile factories have reduced work for several months, but it has not helped the crisis, and even worse. Therefore, if our country wants to seek remedial measures, it must understand the international economic situation and implement the means of the US president's great reforms. Looking around the country, I am afraid that you are the only one who can do it. This is especially what our association wants to represent all sectors and express its expectations to you. The journey has just ended, and we are thinking about your hard work. We only hope that you will cherish your health for the country. I respectfully offer a toast to wish you good health."</p>
<p>Commemorative Silver Medal The commemorative silver medal presented by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other 25 organizations was written by Zhang Shizhao. The text said, "On September 18, 1931, the Japanese used their violence to trap me in Shenyang. Before long, all three provinces were occupied. The country inherited the weakness of the past and used the prestige of overcoming sorrow to win. They only defeated me in Shanghai, but the Japanese cavalry were arrogant and Hot River was lost again. In the blink of an eye, three years have passed, and the national crisis has become deeper. At this time, the world was shaken and there was no end in sight. The way to reproduce has been exhausted, and the opportunity for peace has been cut off. President Roosevelt of the United States convened a meeting first, and the World Economic Conference gathered in London later, all wanting to maintain world peace and alleviate the suffering of the people. The country is deeply concerned and has a long-term vision, and is determined to start from scratch. It is important not to miss the opportunity. Therefore, the country appointed a man of destiny and took on the responsibility of special envoy. So there was Minister Song Ziwen, who visited various countries and sailed west, giving a passionate speech and issuing a heroic cry with Roosevelt, creating a barrier for peace in the Far East. He also discussed business with his countrymen and formed a cotton and wheat agreement to help them move and change and to enrich the people. When he went to England and France, and ascended the platform, his heroic spirit began to spread, and his wonderful reputation was praised. International dignitaries also discussed his views, the price of silver was stabilized, and technical cooperation was finally settled. All of this shows that he is great and detailed, sensitive and harmonious. Wherever he went, the princes and ministers of the countries, celebrities and even the common people, were all delighted and admired, saying, 'This has never happened in China in modern times. Establishing a national foundation, resisting foreign enemies, and increasing the boundless prosperity of the world, it all started here.' Now, Minister Song has worked hard and has great achievements. He returns to his motherland. The gentleman is humble and does not take credit for himself. However, those who have made great contributions to the country should be respected by the people, and those who bear the expectations of the people should especially leave behind the beautiful reputation. The joy of colleagues and others is expressed, and the sigh is often formed, so the words are made, saying, 'The vast land, the great water, is called peace, who can measure its opportunity, there is a tiger in the east, choosing to devour it and fatten it, one night without warning, it suddenly broke through my fence, there are friends and neighbors, who are on the verge of danger, if you don't read it yourself, you will be more afraid of this danger, hundreds of countries are wearing crowns and robes, are discussing and maintaining it, there is the glorious Song Gong, the people's moral character, his heroic appearance stands like a mountain, with a wide forehead and a wide face, he was ordered to go west and emit heroic and strange talents, he came to Jia Gu, and gave me clothes, he received skills and gave orders, and made Zhu Di, the people are sick and thin, and the public came to cure it, in the middle of autumn, the public returned, the battleships were majestic, the river water was rippling, the white gulls were flying and gathering, and they turned back, what to offer to the public, there is wine full of cups, what to please the public, the blue dragon blows the flute, to extend his life, and to give him pure happiness.' Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai General Labor Union, Banking Association, Money Trade Association, Municipal Education Association, University Professors' Union, National Postal Workers' Union, French Concession Ratepayers' Association, Public Concession Ratepayers' Association, Local Autonomy Association, University Students' Federation, Municipal Farmers' Association, Middle School Professors' Union, First Special District Citizens' Federation, Shipping Association, Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Middle School Students' Federation, Accountants' Association, Lawyers' Association, Postal Workers' Union, China Aviation Association, Municipal Fishermen's Association, Boy Scouts Council, International Problems Research Association, Pacific International Association, respectfully presented on August 29, 1933."</p>
<p>Compilation of Speeches Next, Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, gave a welcome speech, saying, "Today, I am here to attend this welcome grand meeting. I am a representative from two aspects. In public, I am a representative of the government. In private, I have a kinship with Minister Song. Therefore, my welcome speech is very difficult to say. If I praise him too much, I will be suspected of favoritism. If I suppress him too much, I will be blamed by the gentlemen who welcomed him yesterday and are here for this banquet today. Therefore, I only hope that Minister Song will fight for China's pride. Minister Song's efforts in the past are known to the public, and can be seen from the enthusiastic welcome from all walks of life. I hope that Minister Song will work harder in the future to repay the grand intention of your welcome." Next, Zheng Hongnian, President of Jinan University, gave a speech, saying, "Minister Song's trip abroad to attend the World Economic Conference has resulted in a major turning point in China's crisis. Governments of various countries attach importance to Minister Song and discuss methods of world peace together. Therefore, Minister Song can be said to be the first person who can seek happiness for the world for the Chinese people. In the future, he will definitely be able to help the government and seek a way out for China to complete his mission." Next, Yu Qiaqing, a representative of the business community, gave a speech, saying, "Minister Song is the most able to do things for the country and the people. I believe that those who come here to participate in the welcome are all enthusiastic from the heart. Minister Song's patriotism can be seen in the fact that he did not land in Japan. The Japanese were eager for Minister Song to land and contact them, but Minister Song ignored them, which was deeply sympathized with by patriots." Next, Tao Baichuan, a representative of the Municipal Education Association, gave a speech, saying, "Sending off and welcoming are bad habits in the officialdom. Those who are not used to dealing in the old society think it is shameful. But today, agriculture, industry, commerce, and education are gathered together to welcome Minister Song, which is completely different from the usual sending off and welcoming. We are here to welcome not because Minister Song is the Minister of Finance, nor because Mr. Song is the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, but because Mr. Song is a world diplomat, a world politician, and a world economist. Mr. Song can succeed in the world, and he will definitely succeed in the country. Seeing that he has established a silver agreement with nine countries and cooperated technically with the League of Nations, opening up a new economic path for China, it is a glory for our country. I hope that we can use the power of the whole country to promote his success." Next, Du Yuesheng, a representative of the Local Autonomy Association, gave a speech, saying, "Since September 18, the country's status has declined greatly. Fortunately, Mr. Song traveled around the world and obtained the understanding of various countries, giving our country economic assistance and technical cooperation. In the future, Minister Song will do his best to reorganize the major agricultural, industrial, and commercial industries in the country. I think today is the second day of Minister Song's return to the country, and it will definitely be the first day of China's rejuvenation." Next, Wang Yansong, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying, "The achievements of Minister Song's efforts have been seen by us. How we will realize them in the future and where to start is a major problem. We know that the government will definitely adopt Minister Song's opinions in the future and do it step by step to develop industry and revive China. In the future, the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors must decide the direction of work and act according to their original position, so as not to disappoint Minister Song's hard work." Next, Lu Jingshi, a representative of the General Labor Union, said, "Since Minister Song went abroad on April 18, it has been four months. Minister Song attended the World Economic Conference, and the United Kingdom and the United States expressed sympathy and gave a warm welcome, which raised the status of the endangered China a lot. Minister Song's achievements have three points: (1) Borrowing cotton and wheat from the United States to adjust China's economy, (2) Signing a silver agreement with nine countries, (3) Sincerely seeking technical cooperation with the League of Nations. However, we still have three hopes for Minister Song: (1) No matter which country we cooperate with economically, we must never give up sovereignty, (2) We must do our best to save the poor among farmers and workers, (3) The national crisis is becoming more and more serious, and we should seek a way to completely reverse the crisis." After the welcome speeches, Mr. Song reported on the process of going abroad and gave a reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's reply Minister Song then stood up and gave a reply, saying, "Fellow compatriots, representatives, I am very grateful for your welcome at the dock yesterday and for your warm and grand banquet today. I am deeply ashamed. I originally planned to stay abroad for two months, but I extended it due to circumstances, so I have not met with you for four months. During my time in Europe and the United States, I discussed important issues with leaders of various countries, all of which are related to the practical cooperation between our country and various countries in economy. After reporting to the government, I will discuss it with you again. China's current economic decline and rural bankruptcy have indeed fallen into difficulties, but after observing from various countries, this state of depression is not unique to China, and all countries are like this. Therefore, during the journey in various countries, whether I was taking a train or eating, I saw unemployed people everywhere. Various countries have deeply felt the suffering of economic panic, so they believe that saving economic panic is an urgent task, and they have devoted their full efforts to cope with the difficult situation. As a result, there is a determination for major reforms, and capitalism has also changed due to the economic panic in various countries, such as the inheritance tax in the United States, which has been increased from 60% to 84% by the government. This is one example. In the financial aspect, the monetary system was resolutely reformed and the gold standard was abandoned. This should not have been the case in the United States, because it is a country with more exports and a creditor country to various countries. However, because various countries are in the frenzy of economic panic, President Roosevelt resolutely implemented it because his purpose was to raise prices. However, he has a certain method and a certain step in implementing this matter. Private individuals must not arbitrarily interfere in any undertaking, and the government implements the principle of intervention. Capitalists are not allowed to oppress workers, and workers are not allowed to strike without reason. Even in emerging countries such as Russia, Italy, and Germany, regardless of their political fascism or communism, their purpose is to seek the common welfare of society and the country. Only in this way can they sacrifice their own rights. Our country has strong enemies pressing down from abroad, communist disturbances within, and economic panic has reached its extreme. In the future, we must unite and unite to have the possibility of development and the hope of becoming strong. Taking the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as an example, in the era of commercial management, due to various malpractices, the business was poor, and the status quo failed, and the sovereignty was completely invaded by foreigners. Now that it has been taken back under state management, the directors and managers are still hired by merchants to preside over. Only in this way can the government and the people cooperate. In the past year, the business situation has greatly improved compared to before. Recently, from the British Boxer Indemnity, loans have been borrowed, and seven new ships have been ordered from the United Kingdom to develop our country's shipping industry. The result of my contact with various countries this time is that all countries can help our country. Therefore, if the domestic commercial, industrial, and financial sectors can implement the principle of unity and cooperate in both production and sales, China, although poor, will surely be able to achieve great things. The reason is that there are millions of unemployed workers in various countries, and there is a surplus of production. It is not a problem that they can help me. However, under this situation in China, whether it can succeed still requires China to have a sound organization and the people can be united. If there is a sound model area, and gradually extend to various places, then it will be sound. The most feared thing for foreigners investing in our country is that there are often problems in our country, and the people cannot be united. Therefore, in the face of internal and external troubles, the only way is to jointly seek unity. If we can unite, then industry will be revitalized, and if industry is revitalized, then politics and diplomacy will have hope. Therefore, after receiving your grand banquet today, I dare to offer these points to you."</p>

<h3>Gu Xinyi Discusses the Freefall of Wheat Flour Prices and Relief Measures</h3>
<p>How American Wheat is Sold</p>
<p>Is of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>At last week's Executive Yuan meeting, President Wang proposed an investigation into the state of wheat production to facilitate relief efforts. Currently, various ministries, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the responsible bureaus of both Shanghai and Nanjing are diligently conducting this investigation. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, recognizing the implications for farmers' economies and the government's determination to regulate wheat production, visited Mr. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Mechanical Flour Milling Industry Association, as Shanghai is the hub for flour mills and a major center for wheat sales, making the matter of particular importance. The following is his account:</p>
<h3>Wheat Production Statistics</h3>
<p>According to him, there has historically been a lack of statistical data regarding domestic wheat production, leaving no basis for understanding the actual figures. This year's wheat harvest, encompassing the three provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, is estimated at approximately 15 million dan (a unit of dry measure, approximately 100 liters). Jiangsu has the largest yield, accounting for 75% of the total, while Anhui and Zhejiang together account for 35%. The current wheat reserves in Shanghai flour mills are approximately 3 million dan, primarily consisting of foreign wheat, estimated at about 2 million dan, with 1 million dan being domestic wheat. Market wheat reserves are also at 600,000 dan, predominantly domestic wheat, estimated at about 450,000 dan, with only 150,000 dan of foreign wheat. Recently, wheat arrivals have been averaging 40,000 to 50,000 dan daily, mostly Jiangbei wheat, with more going to Wuxi. In Wuxi, mills hold 300,000 dan and the market holds 400,000 dan, with daily arrivals of about 5,000 dan. This year's foreign wheat imports (from January to July) peaked in February and March, totaling about 7.5 million dan, primarily Australian wheat, accounting for about 80%. Wheat from America, Canada, and Argentina accounts for the remaining 20%. Wheat consumption in flour mills varies depending on their flour production capacity. Shanghai factories produce approximately 120,000 bags of flour daily, consuming about 60,000 dan of wheat. Assuming a 300-day operating year, annual wheat consumption is approximately 18 million dan. Factoring in both foreign and domestic wheat, this equates to 7.2 million dan of foreign wheat and 10.8 million dan of domestic wheat. Outside Shanghai, Wuxi has the most mills, producing about 300 bags of flour daily and consuming about 15,000 dan of wheat. Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and four other locations have a total of 9 mills, capable of producing 30,000 bags of flour daily and consuming about 15,000 dan of wheat. Therefore, the entire province of Jiangsu can produce 180,000 bags of flour daily, consuming about 90,000 dan of wheat. Attached table (in units of 1,000 bags/1,000 dan):</p>
<p>Address Number of Mills Daily Production Daily Consumption Mill Reserves Mill Reserves Market Reserves</p>
<p>of Flour of Wheat of Flour of Wheat of Wheat</p>
<p>Shanghai 15 120,000 60,000 3,000,000 3,000,000 600,000</p>
<p>Wuxi 3 12,000 15,000 300,000 300,000 400,000</p>
<p>Changzhou 1 3,000 1,500 Unknown Unknown Unknown</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 1 4,000 2,000 Unknown Unknown Unknown</p>
<p>Taizhou 1 3,000 1,500 Unknown Unknown Unknown</p>
<p>Qingjiangpu 1 2,000 1,000 Unknown Unknown Unknown</p>
<p>Haizhou 1 3,000 1,500 Unknown Unknown Unknown</p>
<p>Nanjing 4 15,000 7,500 Unknown Unknown Unknown</p>
<p>(Note) Flour is measured in units of 49 pounds per bag, and wheat is measured in units of 100 liters per dan. The numbers listed above are mostly estimates.</p>
<p>Of the 3 million bags of flour currently in storage in Shanghai, 2 million bags are grade 2 flour, 400,000 bags are grade 3 flour, and 600,000 bags are grade 4 flour.</p>
<h3>The Course of Change</h3>
<p>Wheat was priced at approximately five yuan per dan in the spring of this year. The standard price for new wheat at the February opening auction was also at four yuan sixty or seventy fen. However, by August, the price had fallen to a low of three yuan fifty-three fen. The price of rice was also two yuan seventy or eighty fen in the spring, dropping to two yuan forty or fifty fen when new wheat came onto the market, and further down to two yuan eighteen fen in August. The reasons for these changes and the decline in wheat prices are generally as stated in the recent special economic issue of Shen Bao, but the primary cause is the sluggish flour sales. Wheat's market is flour, and if flour is stockpiling unsold, wheat's outlet is cut off. Shanghai's own flour market has historically been mainly in the north, such as the areas around Beijing, Tianjin, and the three northeastern provinces, which were the largest sales areas for the mills. Since the Northeast fell, the market has been monopolized by Japanese flour mills, which have pushed out Shanghai's flour. Then Japanese flour invaded Beijing and Tianjin, followed by the Soviets, all backed by their respective national governments, dumping their flour regardless of cost. Chinese flour mills are generally operated by merchants with limited capital and cannot compete with the support of Japan and Russia. As a result, Shanghai flour mills' northern sales have dwindled, stocks have increased, and production has decreased, leading to a corresponding reduction in wheat consumption. Furthermore, the slump in rice prices has impacted grain prices, and the abundant harvests of various coarse grains have further affected the sales of machine-milled flour, as wheat-producing areas also have locally milled flour. Currently, Shanghai mills only sell slightly over 30,000 bags of flour to other cities, and about 20,000 bags are sold in Shanghai and its surrounding areas, totaling only half of the daily flour production. This has led to a large surplus of over 3 million bags. The future is uncertain, and unless prompt remedies are taken, the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Wheat is the raw material for flour, and increased flour sales will expand wheat demand. Therefore, rescuing flour is essentially rescuing wheat. The solutions to rescue flour are: (1) How to sell the American wheat that has been borrowed is a critical and difficult issue. However, it is imperative that (A) it absolutely not be sold to foreign merchants, as this would be like giving wings to a tiger and supplying food to the enemy. (B) The Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office should, in conjunction with the Flour Milling Industry Association and the Grain Association, develop a sound plan to distribute the American wheat to Chinese merchants of all sizes. (2) Import duties have already been imposed on imported flour, yet Japanese and Russian flour continue to flood the market, indicating dumping at prices below cost. The government should implement anti-dumping taxes as soon as possible. (3) Local officials are levying excessive taxes on wheat, which should be reduced or exempted to facilitate exports. (4) Farmers in wheat-producing areas need financial assistance to prevent them from rushing to sell, flooding the market with supply exceeding demand, driving down prices further, and causing even greater losses to farmers. It is hoped that the government authorities will promptly take steps to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Turmoil at British American Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>Workers' Opinions Divided</p>
<p>Misunderstandings Arise Between Both Parties</p>
<p>The Disturbance is Temporarily Calmed</p>
<p>Da Gong News reports that the labor strike at the British American Tobacco Company's new and old factories in Pudong remains unresolved. Yesterday morning, over a thousand workers from the new factory's printing department secretly convened and advocated for resuming work. They also went to the union to demand answers, leading to serious disturbances. Upon hearing of this, the Public Security Bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to maintain order. Fortunately, no accidents occurred. The labor dispute issue has been scheduled for arbitration by the municipal government. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Advocating for Returning to Work Over a thousand workers in the printing department of the British American Tobacco Company's Factory No. 2 in Lujiazui, Pudong, have traditionally enjoyed better treatment than workers in other departments. Since the declaration of a general strike in both new and old factories, there has been no hope for a resolution. Consequently, several workers, including Pan Quanrong from the printing department of the new factory, advocated for a decision to resume work unanimously, starting tomorrow (today). This sparked outrage among other workers, who viewed it as undermining unity. Representatives were sent to report to the union. Upon learning of this, the union immediately sent representatives to summon Pan Quanrong to the meeting for questioning. Given the large gathering of workers outside, the union, fearing accidents, advised Pan Quanrong to wait at the meeting, leading to misunderstandings among the workers in the printing department.</p>
<p>Gathering to Demand Answers Over a thousand workers from the printing department of the new factory misunderstood that Pan Quanrong was being detained by the union. They immediately gathered several hundred workers and went to the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union in Laiyidu to demand answers. Upon hearing of this, workers from other departments also misunderstood that the workers in the printing department were gathering to seize the union. They immediately gathered over a thousand people to protect the area around the union. For a time, the two groups of workers were facing off, creating a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Heads Confer The executive committee and supervisors of the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, realizing the misunderstanding between the two groups of workers and fearing an incident, immediately summoned the heads of the printing department of the new factory to the meeting for questioning. The heads all stated that Pan Quanrong did indeed convene a secret meeting of workers in the printing department in an attempt to undermine the strike. At this time, dozens of workers outside the door suddenly sounded whistles, intending to rush into the union.</p>
<p>Police Dispatched to Maintain Order Zhang Mingqin, the district chief of the Third District Public Security Bureau, after receiving a report from the guard, personally led over twenty armed police officers to the scene to maintain order. However, due to the large number of people, it was difficult to disperse them immediately. He then telegraphed the Second Brigade of the Security Force for assistance. The brigade dispatched a squad of motorized bicycle police and a company of box cannon police to assist in maintaining order. A temporary lockdown was imposed until 4 PM, when the crowds gradually dispersed. Over twenty police officers from the Third District Public Security Bureau and the Security Force were stationed at the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union to provide protection and prevent further disturbances.</p>
<p>Seeking Instructions from the Party Committee The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, due to the misunderstanding between the workers, found it more difficult to resolve the dispute. Over a dozen representatives, including the directors Gen Jingguan and Liu Dehua, went to the Municipal Party Committee to seek instructions. Committee member Wu Kaixian met with them, and after inquiring about the situation, dispatched Li Weixiong, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section, to thoroughly investigate the truth before further action. He also notified the Third District Public Security Bureau to provide strict protection and prevent incidents.</p>
<p>Union Precautions The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union received reports that the printing department workers, after being dispersed by the police, returned to the factory to hold a secret meeting and planned to gather again today to demand answers. To prevent this, in addition to requesting police protection from the Public Security Bureau, the union organized a disciplinary team of 120 people, as well as propaganda teams, maintenance teams, and inspection teams, totaling over a thousand people, to maintain strict vigilance near the union starting last night.</p>
<p>Requesting Song's Mediation The New Voice News reports that the Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union, after a strike in 1927 due to disputes over national taxes, was resolved through the mediation of Finance Minister Song Ziwen. In this situation, several attempts at mediation by the authorities have failed to produce results. Furthermore, the delegates' resolution to cope with the strike has worsened the situation. Now that the Minister of Finance has returned from the United States but has not yet returned to Nanjing, it is planned to send representatives to petition him in the coming days to take on the role of mediator.</p>
<p>Scheduled Arbitration After the union requested municipal government arbitration regarding British American Tobacco's failure to pay two days' wages due to the strike, the municipal government has scheduled arbitration for September 5th. Today, a notice was issued to both parties, stating, "Regarding the notification matter, the committee has scheduled September 5th (Tuesday) at 3 PM for arbitration in the case of the labor reduction dispute with the British American Tobacco Company. You are hereby ordered to send two representatives to the hearing to present your opinions and await arbitration. This notice is issued by Luo Pan, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, on August 29, 1933."</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions The Municipal Government Secretariat, recognizing the worsening British American Tobacco dispute, issued an order to both parties yesterday to solicit opinions. The original order stated, "Regarding the order received that the Provisional Regulations for Factory Operations Management of the British American Tobacco Company should be amended urgently to eliminate disputes, the office may send letters to both labor and management to solicit opinions, compile them, and submit them for handling." In addition to sending separate letters, this letter is sent for your information. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government Secretariat, August 28, 1933.</p>
<h3>A Returning Traveler from Xinjiang Speaks</h3>
<p>Luo Liqing Discusses the Recent Situation in Xinjiang Province</p>
<p>Xinjiang borders Russia, is vast and sparsely populated, and has extremely rich reserves of forests and minerals. The Chinese people do not know how to develop them, allowing foreigners to covet them. Since Yang Zengxin, the rulers have embraced a policy of isolationism, causing news to be cut off from the interior. Very few Chinese people know the state of Xinjiang. Recently, after Jin Shuren fled, the central government appointed Huang Musong to go to Xinjiang to comfort and investigate. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Xinjiang, Sheng Shicai suddenly shot and killed the backbone members of the new faction, such as Tao Mingyue, which caused a second coup. The content is complex, and outsiders know very little. Mr. Luo Liqing, a counselor of the Envoy of Comfort Office, ventured to Xinjiang, endured hardships along the way, and finally returned to Shanghai yesterday after three months. The reporter visited Mr. Luo at the hotel and asked about recent events in Xinjiang. He replied in detail, which is recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Hardships on the Journey</h3>
<p>Mr. Luo Liqing went to Xinjiang via Vladivostok, then the Siberian Railway, passing through Novosibirsk and Leningrad, before heading to Tacheng. The journey required sea travel, trains, and automobiles, and was fraught with hardship. Weitangzi is the border between China and Russia entering Xinjiang. From Baktu to Xinjiang Province, ordinary people must undergo strict inspections to get there, as both the Chinese and Russian sides have inspectors stationed there. As a central government official, Mr. Luo was exempt from inspection. Upon arriving in Tacheng, he was welcomed into the province by the local officials.</p>
<h3>The Cause of the New Changes</h3>
<p>The cause of the new changes was Jin Shuren's excessive oppression of the Hui and Kazakh ethnic groups, which led to riots. Sheng Shicai took the opportunity to rise up and drive out Jin, becoming the governor himself, with Liu Wenlong as the chairman of the province. Sheng was originally a subordinate of Guo Songling. In 1928, he was appointed as a colonel staff officer by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and got to know Lu Xiaozu, who brought him to Xinjiang. Yang Zengxin appointed him to a military position. He has only been in Xinjiang for three or four years. Liu Wenlong is a native of Zhejiang. His father had been an official in Xinjiang for a long time and was the original provincial committee member and director of the Education Department. He took advantage of the Hui rebellion to expel Jin and took on the dual roles of military and civilian leader of Xinjiang.</p>
<h3>The Rise of the New Faction</h3>
<p>When Jin Shuren fled, the backbone members of the new faction in Xinjiang formed a Provincial Government Maintenance Committee, including young people such as Chen Zhong (a Whampoa Military Academy student), Tao Mingyue (a provincial committee member), and Li Xiaotian. They opposed Sheng Shicai's rule and advocated for construction along the lines of Soviet Russia and a thorough reform of provincial administration. On June 11th, Huang Musong arrived in Xinjiang. Sheng had already led his troops to Guchengzi to attack Ma Zhongying. While Sheng was at the front, he heard that the young faction, including Chen and Li, were planning to reform the administration. So, after repelling Ma's army, on June 20th, he hurriedly returned to Dihua, the provincial capital, to deal with this matter.</p>
<h3>Killing the Opposition</h3>
<p>Upon returning to Dihua, Sheng immediately convened a provincial military and political conference and announced on the spot that three members of the opposition party must be shot. Tao Mingyue argued fiercely with Sheng at the conference and was immediately bound and paraded through the streets. The three men were executed together. At the same time, Huang Musong was placed under house arrest. The second coup then began. That evening, Sheng also arrested and killed eight people who were affiliated with the young faction. The charges were not announced. Huang Musong was detained from June 21st to July 18th, when he was released and returned to Nanjing after being summoned by the central government. This ended the second coup.</p>
<h3>The Xinjiang Army</h3>
<p>The Xinjiang Provincial Army, commanded by the First Division under Li Hairu, has approximately 6,000 soldiers and is well-equipped with guns and cannons. A brigade in Qitai has already surrendered to Ma Zhongying. There is an artillery battalion in Tacheng, commanded by Battalion Commander Xian Anbang, with approximately 300 soldiers. Sheng Shicai's troops include over 2,000 miscellaneous soldiers from the northern route, as well as 1,500 White Russian naturalized soldiers, known for their fighting prowess, who are directly under Sheng's command. There is a division in Yili under Zhang Peiyuan, which has recently incorporated the remnants of Jin Shuren's troops, with a strength of approximately 7,000 men. There are also soldiers who retreated into Xinjiang from the Anti-Japanese Railway Protection Army, including Zheng Ziliang's brigade under Su Bingwen, which has now been replenished to approximately 5,000 men, mostly stationed in Dihua.</p>
<p>The rest are Su's guard battalion, commanded by Battalion Commander Wang Qingyun, with over 300 soldiers stationed in Tacheng. In addition, there are approximately 4,000 men who retreated into Xinjiang from the troops of Li Du, Ding Chao, and Wang Delin, but there are more than ten brigade commanders.</p>
<h3>Russian Influence</h3>
<p>Russia borders Xinjiang. In recent years, the Soviet Union has been gradually carrying out economic aggression against Xinjiang. Since Jin Shuren signed a secret agreement with Soviet Russia and signed contracts for the purchase of aircraft, military equipment, and automobiles, he secretly allowed Russians to freely enter the interior of Xinjiang to buy, sell, and trade. He also allowed Russians to establish a financial bureau in Xinjiang. Currently, the economic power of Xinjiang is almost entirely in the hands of the Russians. There are already more than 50,000 White Russians who have been naturalized and reside in Xinjiang, engaged in agriculture and commerce.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of the People</h3>
<p>The ethnic groups in Xinjiang are divided into Han, Manchu, Hui, Uyghur, and Kazakh, resulting in diverse races. They have been oppressed by the authorities over the years, and riots have often occurred. According to Mr. Luo, the Hui, Kazakh, Uyghur, and other ethnic groups are actually very enthusiastic about obeying our central government. If the rulers can guide them according to the situation and not discriminate against them, they can live in peace. During Luo's trip to Tacheng, all the Hui people expressed their sincere welcome. Mr. Luo also proclaimed the virtues of the central government, and the people were overjoyed. At that time, Kazakh chiefs such as Issak and Timur Baike held meetings to welcome him and gathered people's groups to hold dance parties, which shows their sincerity.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Economy</h3>
<p>Most of the people in Xinjiang are wealthy and save gold bars and silver coins. The rich have five hundred taels, and the poor have fifty taels. Some people cultivate paddy fields, while others are nomadic. As for the money in circulation, the Provincial Department of Finance issues a silver tael paper currency. Each tael of paper currency is worth half a yuan in national currency. Recently, due to excessive issuance, the market is flooded with paper silver, totaling as much as 200 million, causing the value of the currency to fall daily. Each national currency can buy more than forty taels of paper silver. As a result, there is less and less silver in the hands of the people, and prices are gradually becoming more expensive. Xinjiang produces the world-renowned Turpan cotton, as well as valuable furs, forests, petroleum, crystal rock salt, gold, silver, jewels, jade, and deer antlers.</p>
<h3>Sightseeing in Kulun</h3>
<p>After arriving in Xinjiang, Mr. Luo also visited Kulun and exchanged greetings with the Mongolian New Government authorities. In his capacity as a private citizen, Mr. Luo flew to Kulun and stayed for about ten hours, receiving a warm welcome from the New Government authorities. Mongolian New Government officials, including Prince Yi Li Bo of the Right Wing, Duke Ai Lin of the Supporting State, Sida Bija, the head of the Altai Kazakh people, and the chief of the twelve Keliyi households, all welcomed him at the station, hosted him at a banquet inside the New Government, and led him to visit the Lama Temple. Mr. Luo was urgently recalled by a telegram from the central government, so he could not stay long and left Kulun to return to China.</p>
<h3>Ma's Army Rebellion</h3>
<p>When the reporter asked about Ma Zhongying's recent situation, Mr. Luo replied that since he left Dihua on the 10th of this month, he often heard the sound of Ma attacking the provincial capital. Ma currently has tens of thousands of troops, and even more followers from the Hui rebellion. Ma's troops are located in the Yanqi area southwest of the Tianshan Mountains. Dihua is reportedly launching an encirclement attack, and Sheng Shicai is mobilizing troops to meet him. I was on the way in the past three weeks, so the truth is unclear.</p>
<h3>Seeking Shandong People in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>There are many people from Shandong Province who do business and farm in Xinjiang. These Shandong people were originally in Soviet Russia. Recently, due to the signing of treaties by Russia, they cannot return to China from Vladivostok, so many have changed their route and returned from Xinjiang. After arriving in Xinjiang, they stayed there. There are currently no fewer than 50,000 Shandong people in the province. The Russian compatriots in Soviet Russia go to Xinjiang and are issued passports by Consul Mo stationed in Tacheng. Each batch involves three to four thousand people.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Announces that Property Owners Must Report Land Prices Themselves</h3>
<p>Begins Tomorrow and Lasts Until the End of September</p>
<p>Landowners in Shanghai South and Zhabei Districts Must Report First</p>
<p>The Shanghai Land Bureau, in order to collect land value tax, issued Announcement No. 69 yesterday, based on the provision in Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations that property owners must report land prices themselves. The announcement stipulates that from September 1st to the end of the month, property owners must come to the bureau to obtain forms and report their land prices.

<h3>Zhang Yuanfu Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, August 30th (Central News Agency) - Zhang Yuanfu, the representative of Sheng Shicai, the Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang, arrived in Nanjing yesterday on a Eurasian Airlines flight from Xinjiang. He had a discussion with Zhang Fengjiu, the representative of Xinjiang Province stationed in Nanjing. On the morning of the 30th, he traveled to Shanghai from Nanjing by train. He will return to Nanjing in a few days to report on the recent situation in Xinjiang Province to President Wang, and then go to Guling to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is rumored that Mr. Zhang brought some red gold to Shanghai to convert it into cash.</p>
<h3>The Queen of the Netherlands' Birthday Today</h3>
<p>The Dutch Consulate General Holds a Celebration</p>

A celebration ceremony will be held at the consulate today, and foreign guests will be invited. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of the Municipal Government, as well as Yu Ming, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, and Zhao Tiezhang, Chief of the Section, will all go to offer congratulations today to strengthen friendly relations.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Repair the Seawall</h3>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Local Collaboration Association previously sent a joint telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding the dangerous situation of the Baoshan seawall, requesting that funds for labor and materials be prepared in advance to expedite repairs. The provincial government has now replied, stating, "Your telegram has been received. Two million yuan has already been allocated for the emergency repair project of the seawall in the county, and the county magistrate has been ordered to start construction immediately. The breach of the Yellow River in the counties of Lanfeng, Changheng, Dongming, etc., is serious. Jiangsu is located downstream and is particularly concerned about the disaster. It has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to dispatch senior officials to preside over the blocking and restoration, and has also telegraphed the counties along the canal to take protective measures. Recently, it has been reported that the breach in Lanfeng is no longer flooding, and the Dongming water is flowing into southern Shandong, reaching the Weishan Lake, and there is a trend of flowing into the central canal. Please inform accordingly. This reply."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Rejects Chamber of Commerce's Request to Issue Transportation Certificates for Stored Tobacco</h3>
<p>Local Tobacco Leaves with Old Taxes Paid</p>
<p>Are Exempt from Special Tax in This City</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Tobacco Leaf Industry Association regarding the problems that may arise in the transportation of stored tobacco after the special tax on local tobacco leaves was introduced. It requested that the Ministry of Finance be telegraphed to issue certificates for the transportation of old tobacco when local tobacco leaves with old taxes paid are transported to other cities to exempt them from paying the new tax. After the telegram was sent, the Ministry of Finance replied, stating, "Your telegram has been received. Regarding the collection of the special tax on local tobacco leaves, the measures for paying the new tax and refunding the old tax on inventory issued by the Taxation Department stipulate that local tobacco leaves stored in this city that have paid the old tax should be reported and converted to the special tax before July 31st before being allowed to be sold and transported. Subsequently, the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association stated the difficulties, and the department, in order to accommodate the merchants, revised the original measures and separately reviewed and supplemented various points. It allowed local tobacco leaves that had paid the old tax before July and were stored in Shanghai to be sold in this city within a period of three months, i.e., from July to the end of September, without being required to pay the special tax. However, within three months, if local tobacco leaves are transported from Shanghai to other cities, the old tax should still be refunded at any time, and the special tax should be reported and paid before they are allowed to be exported, to show a compromise. The association was notified separately and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau was ordered to comply. The merchants should understand and comply, and there is no need to make further requests. The request to issue transportation certificates for stored tobacco transported to other cities to exempt them from the new tax should not be considered. In addition to informing the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau, this reply is hereby issued. Inform accordingly. This reply."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Sends Personnel to Fiji to Investigate Sanitary Administration</h3>
<p>Yi Wenzhi and Wu Deming Set Off Yesterday</p>
<p>Trade between China and Fiji is developing rapidly. This spring, the Fijian government organized a delegation to visit China. In April, they sent Minister of Health, Dr. Forkardt, to China to investigate the health situation in our country and to investigate the manufacturing methods of our exported ham and meat products. They are deeply concerned about trade between China and Fiji. Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, believes that the bureau's responsibility is to manage inspections and assist merchants in developing foreign trade. A large quantity of our country's meat and ham is sold to Fiji. However, because the island is not clear about our manufacturing methods, it often uses the excuse of non-compliance with hygiene standards to prohibit imports, which has a great impact on our country's trade with Fiji. The island's sanitation facilities are known to be perfect, and it pays special attention to the inspection of imported food. It is urgent to send personnel to promote and investigate separately, so as to facilitate sales and provide a reference for our country. Therefore, the bureau has specially dispatched Fijian technical officer Yi Wenzhi and technician Wu Deming to Fiji to investigate everything. They set off yesterday (the 30th) and have reported to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and record.</p>

<h3>Telegram Received by Anhui Fellow Provincial Association</h3>
<p>Han Shan County Besieged by Bandits</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow Provincial Association recently received a telegram from a large merchant in He County, stating that at 6:00 AM on the 26th of this month, a large group of ferocious bandits entered Han Shan County, committing arson, murder, rape, and plunder in a cruel manner. The local authorities did not fire a single shot to resist. The bandits occupied the county town for two days and nights, looting until 8:00 AM on the 28th, before retreating to a mountain recess on the outskirts. They are still gathering and have not dispersed. If they are not severely suppressed, it is feared that the tragedy of Fuyang and Yingzhou will happen again near the capital.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese General Ends Up Polishing Shoes in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Earning Over 30 Yuan a Month</p>
<p>Does Not Forget to Donate to Northeast Refugees</p>
<p>Jiang Minsheng, a former major general and advisor of Ding Chao's anti-Japanese army in Northeast China, a native of Harbin, has drifted to Shanghai. He has been given food and lodging by the Shanghai Charity Organizations and the Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees on Yunnan Road, which ensured his safety. Later, he was given some capital by the association to buy shoe polish and powder and started polishing shoes for pedestrians at the entrance of a lane next to the Cathay Theatre on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, which is enough for him to live on. Apart from expenses and savings, he specially donated funds to the association yesterday and sent it by letter to be remitted to the Northeast to relieve the refugees. The original letter reads, "Respectfully, Minsheng is drifting at sea and is honored to have been given food and lodging by your association. I am also grateful for your help in starting a small business to make a living. I started polishing shoes on July 25th and it has been a month now. The total income is 32.20 silver dollars. I respectfully donate 5 silver dollars to your association to save our Northeast refugees. The remaining amount is 10 yuan for postal savings, 4.50 yuan for buying shoe polish and boot powder, 6.20 yuan for pocket money, and 2.50 silver dollars for buying clothes. I still have 4 yuan in hand. I hereby report and express my gratitude. Respectfully presented to the Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees of Various Shanghai Charity Organizations."</p>
<h3>The Trunk Murder Case Has Been Investigated</h3>
<p>Victim Was Chopped to Death Before Being Dismembered</p>
<p>Court Orders Strict Arrest of the Murderer</p>
<p>Early in the morning the other day, a wooden trunk and a package were found at the entrance of the Cantonese People's Hospital at the intersection of Route D'Orleans and Paoan Road in Hongkou. After being opened and inspected, it was found that they contained a dismembered male corpse, a total of eight pieces. The detectives took them to the Route D'Orleans Police Station and photographed each piece of the head and limbs before taking them to the Forensic Examination Office on Rue Frelupt to await the official examination. Details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, Prosecutor of the First Special District District Court, led forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan, and Clerk Wang Zuyi in a car to the office. Under the lawful examination of the two forensic doctors, they reported to the prosecutor that the examination revealed that the deceased was chopped in the vital parts of the head and chest with an ax-like weapon, causing death, and then the body was dismembered. Subsequently, the police station summoned Chen Zongming, a shop assistant at the Cantonese People's Hospital, for questioning. According to his statement, a patient in the hospital, Li Jiansheng, said that at that time, Li opened the window of the ward and looked out, and suddenly saw a rickshaw puller running with a car. In addition to a passenger, there was also a box and bedding on the car. When they arrived in front of the hospital, the car stopped, and the passenger moved the box and bedding to the ground. After the rickshaw puller left, the passenger also left. At first, he did not expect that the box and bedding contained a dismembered corpse. That is what Li said, and I don't know anything else. Since the dismemberment of the corpse has been verified, Prosecutor Guo ordered that it be handed over to the Pushan Mountain Villa for collection and burial, and ordered the police station to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. At the same time, in order to solve the case quickly, the police station specially announced a reward yesterday for the rickshaw puller who was hired at the time to go to the police station to report, and a bonus will be given to him.</p>
<h3>Female Passenger on the Da Yu Steamer Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Sea</h3>
<p>A Man and a Woman Boarded the Ship at Tianshenggang</p>
<p>The Man Has Now Been Sent to the Bureau by the Water Patrol Team</p>
<p>The Da Yu steamer of the Nanshi Dada Company, on its voyage back to Shanghai, had a young man and woman on board when it arrived at Tianshenggang midway. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 AM yesterday morning, just as the ship was passing Yaogang and arriving at the Qiwangsha River, one of the two women suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. Although the ship stopped and attempted a rescue, it failed to retrieve the body. A man who traveled with her has been sent by the Water Patrol Corps of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to the Public Security Bureau for verification. The situation is very peculiar, and the details are described below.</p>
<h3>Young Man and Woman Board the Ship Together</h3>
<p>The Da Yu steamer of the Nanshi Dada Company set anchor from Tianshenggang at about 4:00 AM yesterday morning and set sail for Shanghai. At that time, two young men and women suddenly boarded the ship together at the Tianshenggang wharf, with three pieces of luggage and a small rattan basket. Because all the cabins were full, two berths were set up in the large kitchen room. Soon after the ship left the shore, the two men and women often went to the railings outside the large kitchen room to talk intimately.</p>
<h3>After Passing Yaogang, the Woman Suddenly Jumps into the River</h3>
<p>At about 6:00 AM, the ship passed Yaogang and arrived at the Qiwangsha River. The man suddenly walked into the large kitchen room and fell asleep on a military bed. Unexpectedly, the woman took this opportunity to jump into the river. Other passengers caught sight of it and were greatly shocked, causing an immediate commotion. The shipowner heard about it and quickly stopped the ship and tried to salvage the body, but the woman had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>The Man Who Came with Her Was Sent to the Water Patrol Team</h3>
<p>Since the woman's suicide by jumping into the river was very closely related to the man, he was placed under surveillance. When the ship arrived in Shanghai at about 11:00 AM at noon, Dada Company prepared a letter and sent the man, together with the tea boy Chen Xiang who witnessed all the actions of the two men and women on the ship, and his luggage to the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation. When Chief Zhu of the team conducted a preliminary trial of the case, the tea boy Chen Xiang on the ship confessed the previous situation and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>The Man Claims They Met by Chance</h3>
<p>When questioned, the man claimed his name was Mao Mengjue, 22 years old, from Pingjiang, Hunan. Yesterday, I took a boat from Yongzhou to Tianshenggang and stayed at the Zhang Shunji Inn there in order to wait for a boat to Shanghai to find a job. Because the woman who jumped into the river also stayed at the inn, we got to know each other. After talking, she said that her surname was Zhang and that she had been studying at the Shanghai Wuben Girls' School. This time, because the school's opening date was near, she was waiting for a boat here to set off. At that time, I saw that her dress was very similar to that of a student, but she had a frowning expression, as if she had an unspeakable secret. However, I did not go into details because we met by chance.</p>
<h3>Various Oppressions Led to an Early Suicide Plan</h3>
<p>Then the woman suddenly wrote a note and sent it to me. The note stated that because of family economic and other pressures, she planned to commit suicide. However, she still lacked travel expenses for her studies in Shanghai, so she asked to borrow 3 silver dollars as travel expenses. After arriving in Shanghai, she would return the money immediately and would never break her promise. However, because I did not bring much travel expenses myself, I refused. However, I agreed to bear the cost of boat tickets and other expenses along the way to Shanghai. The woman also agreed. Later, we boarded the Da Yu steamer together.</p>
<h3>The Matter Concerns Human Life, Sent to the Bureau for Verification</h3>
<p>On the ship, the woman repeatedly revealed her intention to commit suicide. When I asked her the reason for her suicide, she refused to tell the truth. At that time, I tried my best to comfort her. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 AM this morning, when the ship arrived at the Qiwangsha River, the woman took the opportunity of my sleeping soundly and jumped into the river. Because there are many untruths in the man's confession, an official document was prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Eight More Guard Posts Added to the Extra-Territorial Road Construction in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Be Established on September 1st</p>
<p>Since the winter of the 13th year of the Republic of China, during the Qi-Lu War, the British Public Works Department opened more than 20 roads outside the boundaries in the Fahua and Pusong areas of western Shanghai. Various French groups in Shanghai opposed this because it was a loss of sovereignty, and petitioned the National Government to protest strongly to the British Consulate. After repeated discussions between the two sides, the unconditional recovery has not been resolved, so that all administrative matters on the road are handled by the Public Works Department, which is an act of usurping power and humiliating the country. In view of this, the Municipal Government ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to add eight guard posts in the jurisdiction of the first and second sub-bureaus of the sixth district, namely, Qiaodun Road, Anhe Temple Road, and Daxi Road (the second sub-bureau of the sixth district), Lincoln Road, Robegen Road, MacArthur Road, Memorial Arch Road, and Pias Road (the first sub-bureau of the sixth district). Two classes of capable police officers will be selected for each post to take turns to be stationed there, as a precursor to the future recovery of the extra-territorial road construction. After receiving the order, Chief Liu Lun and Chief Bi Zhenhua immediately started work and spared no effort. The preparations have now been completed and the establishment is scheduled for September 1st.</p>
<h3>Two Prisoners Preach Communism in Prison</h3>
<p>And Copied Out Draft Documents for Preaching Communism</p>
<p>No Audience Allowed at the Trial; Sentencing Today</p>
<p>The young man Wu Liwen, 21 years old this year, was arrested by the political department of the French police for preaching communism in the French Concession and sent to the Third Branch Court of Jiangsu Higher Court for interrogation, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. Fu Heqing was arrested by the police in the French Concession for committing arson and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was sentenced to imprisonment. Both were sent to the Second Special District Prison for execution. Unexpectedly, Wu still did not repent and colluded with Fu Heqing in prison to preach communism to the prisoners. Last month, when Wu and others were preaching to prisoners Yu Xishan, who was guilty of theft, and Wu Xuande, who was guilty of rebellion, they were seen by guard Song Cha. Documents for preaching communism were copied out from Wu's and Fu's sides and reported to the chief warden, who reported it to Warden Sun Xiongli, who detained Wu and Fu in another prison and prepared a document to transfer Wu and others to the Third Branch Court of Jiangsu Higher Court for interrogation. After repeated court investigations by Prosecutor Zhang Zongru of the High Court, a public prosecution was filed with the criminal court of the same level. Yesterday, Criminal Judge Zhou Yunhui, accompanied by Assessors Fan Peien and Li Shouyi, together with Prosecutor Zhang, convened the two prisoners Wu and Fu, the two prisoner witnesses Yu and Lu, and the guards to the third court for trial. Wu Liwen appointed lawyer Huang Zengjie as his defender. Fu Heqing was assigned lawyer Tu Kunfan by the court to defend him. Because Tu did not arrive, lawyer Huang was temporarily assigned to defend him. Because the case was political, no audience was allowed. It was heard that as a result of the trial, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 31st.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide by Jumping into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At about 9:00 PM the night before last, a young man at the Xinkuang Wharf on Hankou Road suddenly jumped into the Huangpu River and committed suicide while people were not paying attention. At that time, a companion was standing on the dock enjoying the cool air. When he discovered it, he called out to the nearby boatmen to help him salvage the body, but the man's body sank and did not come up for a long time, so he could not be saved and drowned at the bottom of the river. At that time, a patrolman from the Customs Water Patrol Police Station arrived and took the deceased's companion to the police station. According to the statement, the deceased's name was Mei Chongxi, 20 years old, from Hubei. We both came to the dock together to enjoy the cool air. I don't know what the deceased had in mind, but he took the opportunity to commit suicide. As for what he was wearing, it was a white silk gauze long gown and white cloth trousers. The police chief ordered to notify the family of the deceased to send someone to salvage the body and collect it for burial.</p>
<h3>Breaking Two Extortion Cases by Catching an Extortion Gang</h3>
<p>Architect Li Zuxian Extorted 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Money Giant Qin Runqing Receives Two Threatening Letters</p>
<p>Li Zuxian, a Ningbo architect residing at No. 599 Jiaozhou Road, suddenly received a letter by mail at about 11:00 AM on the 13th of this month. Upon opening it, it was a threatening letter. The signatory was the Youth Anti-Traitor Group, and the language was fierce, demanding 5,000 yuan, saying that if he did not agree, they would use appropriate means to deal with him and arranged to contact him at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Wenzhou Road on the 16th. Li reported the letter to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge. The police chief ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to go to wait and see, but the bandits did not come. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 18th, Li received another threatening letter, saying why he had sent police officers to wait last time, and now he specially warned him not to pay. He arranged to contact him at the intersection of Pike Road and Datong Road at 2:00 PM on the 19th. The person who came must put the paper money in a red paper bag. Li reported to the police station again and sent Chinese Detective Zhu Hanbo, Detective Liu Chunshu, and Pi Shaochang to hide nearby. On the one hand, Li's coachman, Li Ada, pretended to be a representative, carrying a red paper bag in the shape of 5,000 yuan of banknotes, and waited at the appointed place. At 4:10 PM, the bandit Lu Zhiquan, from Anhui, came, first wandering around Li Ada, intending to observe whether there were any undercover detectives. Then he stepped forward to talk to Li, took the red paper bag, and gave Li a receipt, carrying the bag and fleeing. He was chased and caught by the undercover detectives, and another receipt was copied out, which stated that Qin Runqing had received 5,000 yuan of ocean. He was taken to the police station for detention, and the next morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. After a questioning, because the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that a receipt to Qin Runqing had been copied from the defendant, the defendant was still committing another case and requested a postponement. The court approved, and because the police station was investigating the case, the release was temporarily postponed. The Chinese and foreign detectives who handled the case investigated and found that Lu had written threatening letters twice on the 13th and 18th of this month, attempting to defraud the money tycoon Qin Runqing of 5,000 yuan. Because Qin did not report to the police station, he went to the Yuyuan Money Shop on Ningbo Road to retrieve the two threatening letters and took them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the continued hearing was due. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the circumstances of the case, saying that the defendant was now prosecuted for attempted extortion under Article 370, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, and the police station had ordered the defendant to write a note. Under the comparison of the handwriting on the threatening letter and the receipt he sent, they were exactly the same. Therefore, the case was actually committed by the defendant and there was no doubt. The interrogation should be requested. Then, Qin Luoping, the son of Qin Runqing, claimed that my father went to Ningbo because of the death of a friend, but I did not know about this case at first. Until the police detectives came and said that my father had received a threatening letter, I went to the Yuyuan Money Shop. Because my father was not in Shanghai, all the letters were not opened and placed in the letter slot. Now that there was a threatening situation, I opened each letter and found two threatening letters inside, which were taken away by the detectives. When questioned, the defendant Lu Zhiquan confessed that the matter was initiated by Wang Jinkui, who was at large. I was really fooled by him. He shed tears as he spoke, with great remorse. After Judge Xue verified the confession, he ordered that the interrogation of the case be concluded and the sentencing be postponed to September 6. The defendant was returned to the police station.</p>

<h3>Zhang Shizhao and Others File an Appeal for the Liu Chongwu Case</h3>
<p>丨Already Submitted to the Supreme Court丨</p>
<p>The patriotic youth Liu Chongwu and others, for throwing a bomb to warn treacherous merchants, were prosecuted by the police for premeditated murder. After a ruling by the appellate court, they were sentenced to twelve years in prison, causing dissatisfaction among various groups. An "Aid the Patriotic Volunteers Association" was organized, and a resolution was passed in a meeting to file an appeal. Chen Jiufeng was publicly elected to proceed with the matter, and three lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Ma Junshuo, and Zou Shengzu, were hired to appeal to the Supreme Court. The appeal petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of supplementing the appeal, the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau prosecuted the defendants for premeditated murder. Judgment Document No. 14 of the 22nd Year of the Supreme Court stated: "The original judgment regarding Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, and Tian Shuiyang is revoked. Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, and Cao Songshou are each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for continuous joint premeditated murder. Tian Shuiyang is sentenced to six years of imprisonment for assisting in premeditated murder. The number of days detained before the judgment is final shall be offset against the imprisonment at the rate of two days for one day," etc. An appeal has been declared within the legal time limit. The legal reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment are presented in detail as follows: The original judgment revoked the first-instance judgment and changed the sentence to a heavier one, stating that the first-instance judgment mistakenly convicted the defendant Liu Chongwu of ordinary murder, Cao Songshou of assault, Pan Hongsheng of possession of military firearms and ammunition, and Tian Shuiyang of endangering safety. The basis for convicting the defendants was roughly as follows: "The defendants are an organized group with an entire criminal plan, with the purpose of obstructing others from exercising their rights, and using murder as a means," etc. This is indeed the essence of the original judgment's conviction. The defendants committed criminal acts due to their fervent patriotism (as stated in the rationale section of the original judgment). This is the premise of the original trial's confirmation of the case. Based on this premise, although the defendants had a group organization, their entire plan must have been nothing more than an attempt to save and protect the country. To call it an entire criminal plan is completely off-topic. Moreover, according to the defendants' confessions and the police's report, their dangerous words and intimidation of merchants selling Japanese goods has been confirmed as a common fact. The occurrence of this kind of fact must have had a common purpose. The common purpose of the defendants in this case could not be other than resisting Japan and saving the country. This is the conclusion obtained by advancing from the premise confirmed by the original trial. Therefore, it can only be said that their purpose was to resist Japan and save the country, and their means was to obstruct people from exercising their rights. The original judgment mistakenly identified this key point, leading to the conclusion that the murder was premeditated. Criminal facts should always be determined based on evidence. This is clearly stipulated in Article 282 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Interpretation Example No. 1242 of the 9th Year of the Unified Ruling states: "The evidence used to determine criminal facts must have conclusive probative force and cannot be shaken by other legitimate materials. If there are other credible materials sufficient to provide corroboration, then it can be used as a basis for an affirmative determination." This has strict regulations in law and precedent. Furthermore, the collection of evidence must be extensive, and it should not rely on only one piece of evidence. Solid physical evidence should be collected, and it should not rely solely on observational circumstantial evidence. The trial court that judges crimes must state the results of the investigation in detail and concretely, and should not only make abstract speculations. This has been repeatedly established as a precedent. Now, the original trial speculated that they had a premeditated murder based solely on the group's opening behavior. According to the above-mentioned fundamental principles of law and precedent, the content of this premeditated behavior, and where the resolution was, must be actually proven before it can be used as the basis for the judgment. However, the original judgment gained nothing and speculated out of thin air, not only contradicting its confirmed premise. This is the fundamental reason why the defendants disagree with the original judgment and appeal. As for the purpose of the defendants, it is already understood by the society. Their simple and decisive means is only to prevent the purchase and sale of enemy goods. Not only was there no premeditated murder, but there was no intention to kill from the beginning. Trying to use the following facts as a reference can further prove the credibility. (1) Before throwing the bomb, Sun Guangxing warned Xie Bintai to avoid it quickly (see Xie Bintai's confession on December 9, 21st year). This alone is sufficient to prove that there was no intention to kill. Xie Bintai and Wang Yirong have no personal grudges with the defendants. There is no reason to save one and premeditate to kill the other. (2) In the De Yuanchang case, the defendant Chongwu put the bomb in through the door seam on the floor (see the first-instance transcript), so his intention not to harm anyone is already clear. (3) The Dawangmiao meeting resolved to carry out work, that is, to warn against importing Japanese goods. As for carrying handguns, it was because the Japanese Red Shirts were harmful and had to be used for self-defense (court testimony on December 29, 21st year). According to this confession, the group meeting only intended to threaten the sale of enemy goods, and there was absolutely no intention to harm the lives of others. This is already clear as fire. (4) In the Yuyuanheng case, Wang Yirong dragged the defendant Chongwu, and the force was too strong, causing the switch to be touched and misfired (see the court testimony on January 5th of this year). This unfortunate incident was really an accidental occurrence during the journey. There was absolutely no intention to kill, let alone premeditated murder. Based on the above facts, the revised judgment of premeditated murder, although it avoids the suspicion of deliberately finding fault, should be requested by the Supreme Court to abolish the original judgment according to law and declare the appellants innocent, which is both in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Discovers the Oldest Buddhist Scriptures</h3>
<p>Shanxi Correspondence: The Shanghai Photographic Printing Song Dynasty Buddhist Scriptures Association previously sent Venerable Fancheng to visit scriptures in Shaanxi and Shanxi. More than 5,000 volumes of ancient scriptures have now been discovered in Guangshang Temple in Zhaocheng, Shanxi. They are arranged according to the Thousand Character Classic and are in the form of hand scrolls. At the end of the "Lu Character Transmission Lantern Jade Ying Scroll", there is a postscript from the second year of Jingyou of the Song Dynasty (Bingzi year of Emperor Renzong). The benefactors were mostly people from Puzhou in southern Shanxi. Examining the beginning of its printing, it should have started in the Five Dynasties. Each wooden board has 23 lines on one side, with 14 characters per line. The font is extremely simple and ancient. This kind of precious book has never been seen in domestic public or private records. Even those who collect Buddhist scriptures abroad have never seen it. In the history of Buddhist studies and editions, it is truly an unprecedented creation. Xu Junsenyu from Beiping heard the news and rushed to Guangshang Temple to borrow it. He first transported it to Beiping, and after it was publicly read by fellow Buddhists, it was transferred to Shanghai for the association to reprint.</p>
<h3>Li Zongtian Impersonates an Investigator and Extorts Money</h3>
<p>Claims to be an inspector of the Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>Discovered, arrested, and judged to be transferred</p>
<p>Li Zongtian from Xuzhou has been running a sesame cake shop at No. 93 Edward Road. Recently, he has been impersonating the name of an inspector of the Songhu Garrison Commander's Training Corps, privately engraving business cards, and extorting money from his fellow tradesmen under various pretexts. After someone reported this to the Garrison Headquarters, an investigation was launched. Inspector Xu Pengfei was sent to report to the First Special Court and request an arrest warrant. He also went to the New Gate Police Station with detectives to arrest him, but without success. It was not until 2 p.m. that the informant, Zhang Deqing, happened to meet Li Zongtian on North Zhejiang Road. He grabbed him and handed him over to the police, who took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Local Court. According to the case presented by police lawyer Wang Yaotang, the Garrison Headquarters requested a transfer. If sufficient evidence could be presented, the police would not object. Subsequently, Inspector Xu Pengfei of the Command Headquarters filed a case to prove that the defendant had been impersonating the name of our Training Corps to extort money from others. Zhang Deqing and others submitted a letter of accusation and presented business cards. Now that he has been arrested, a transfer is requested. Zhang also stated that Li Zongtian impersonated the name of the Garrison Headquarters and extorted 200 yuan from me. When the defendant Li Zongtian was interrogated, he denied the accusations and hired lawyer Fan Gang to oppose the transfer, saying that Li was accused of fraud by Xi Siwen. Yesterday afternoon, after the Fifth Court of your court opened the trial, Li walked out of the court door and was immediately arrested by Zhang Mingbu, etc. Judge Xue ruled in court that Li Zongtian was accused of financial fraud by the informant Zhang Deqing, and there was an original letter stored in the Garrison Commander's Headquarters, which was sufficient to prove the suspicion was serious. The transfer should be approved.</p>

<h3>Pan Ruyue, the Boss of the Hongwan Factory, is Arrested</h3>
<p>The Second District First Precinct previously uncovered a Hongwan factory at No. 2 Hepingli, Ji畝di. Because the main criminal, Zhao Dongsheng, was on the run, the precinct notified Zhao's guarantor, but he also fled in fear of punishment. The luggage and furniture left in the factory were sealed up. Director Shen had already submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and was dispatched to the house to inspect and open the list together. All were presented to the storage and storage department of the General Bureau. However, it was recently found that the Hongwan factory was organized by the feathers of Xiao Shandong, the famous Hongwan King, and Pan Ruyue, who partnered with Zhao Dongsheng, was hiding in the Ruifuli of Zilaihu Street in the French Concession. Immediately, without making a sound, he went to the French police station and arrested Pan Ruyue and brought him to the police station. Because the case was in the Chinese boundary, he was handed over to the detectives and brought to the Second District First Precinct for investigation. Director Shen immediately interrogated him and confirmed that he was the front boss of the Hongwan factory at No. 2 Hepingli. He ordered him to prepare a document to be submitted to the General Bureau for handling according to law.</p>

<h3>A Group of Thugs Destroys Longyuan Teahouse</h3>
<p>Reason... Listening to Baitanh Huang is not allowed</p>
<p>Result... 25 people arrested</p>
<p>All the electric lights in the hall were destroyed and extinguished</p>
<p>Teapots and teacups were thrown around in a chaotic manner</p>
<p>Three cars were destroyed</p>
<p>Two axes were confiscated</p>
<p>Longyuan Teahouse, located at No. 1 Houmalukou, Jiaojiaodu, Shanghai West, was suddenly attacked by twelve thugs dressed in short clothes at about 9 p.m. on the 26th of this month (i.e., last Saturday). They swarmed upstairs and went straight into the Tanh Huang performance area. The ticket seller immediately stepped forward to collect the ticket money (the standard rate is 34 copper coins per person). The thugs gave 8 cents in small money. Because the amount was not enough, the ticket seller asked them to make up the difference. The thugs were very aggressive and shouted loudly. They left their seats one after another. The ticket seller returned the 8 cents in small money to them, because they did not listen to the performance. They refused to accept it and left, saying that someone would come to get it and give you a hard time. Because of this, they wanted to retaliate. At 8:20 p.m. the night before, they gathered a large group of thugs, numbering hundreds, each holding weapons. They took nine chartered cars and two No. 16 trolleybuses and headed west from Shanghai. The cars arrived at Jiaojiaochang first and stopped. They swarmed into the teahouse and shouted loudly. The full-scale fight began immediately. First, all the electric lights in the hall were destroyed and extinguished. Then, teapots and teacups were thrown around in a chaotic manner. The order was in chaos. Fortunately, armed police and all the members of the security regiment arrived at the same time and surrounded the teahouse, and made every effort to suppress the situation to avoid injuries. Four cars, electric lights, teacups, tables and chairs were destroyed. Twenty-five thugs were arrested on the spot. The rest had fled separately. Two axes were confiscated and taken into custody. District Officer Jiang first interrogated Wu Fushun, the owner of the teahouse, and Ge Yibao, the manager, and then interrogated the thugs. They all confessed to being accomplices. Most of them were pig killers. Half of them returned halfway because they heard the alarm on the tram. After obtaining the confessions, the district officer believed that the thugs had gathered a crowd to cause trouble without any reason, carried weapons to commit violence, and disturbed the peace. They were really hateful. Yesterday, he prepared a document and sent them to the General Bureau for interrogation. The names of the thugs are recorded below: Dong Hongjun, Xu Xilin, Huang Shaofu, Sun Qilang, Pang Bojin, Sun Jingen, Yao Asan, San Wenrui, Wu Shenrui, Qiang Hongrui, Zhou Afang, Zhu Shengrong, Jin Genrui, Liu Hanzhuan, Qiu Zhengqi, Xu Zhongying, Dai Binggen, Liu Dalang, Shi Shilin, Li Amao, Pan Baolang, Xu Mingde, Cai Ronglang, Qian Rengui, Yao Shengxiang, a total of twenty-five people.</p>
<h3>The Completion of the Reconstruction of the North Station and the Transportation Office Scheduled to Move in Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony has been postponed</p>
<p>The public will be invited to visit the new site on a scheduled basis</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Shanghai War, the North Station of the Two Roads was bombed by Japanese aircraft. The Ministry of Railways recruited merchants to rebuild it. Now the entire project has been completed, and the Transportation Office has decided to move in tomorrow to work. The opening ceremony has not been scheduled. The Two Roads Bureau plans to invite the public to visit on a scheduled basis. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Construction Completed</h3>
<p>After the North Station of the Two Roads was destroyed, the Ministry of Railways recruited merchants to rebuild it. Since construction began nearly three months ago, it has been largely completed. However, the interior decoration, electric lights, and telephones were not completed until yesterday. The internal settings are slightly different from the old ones. The building has two floors and is made of red mud. The four black characters "Shanghai North Station" are written on the door, which is quite spectacular.</p>
<h3>Move in to Work</h3>
<p>Because the new house has been completed, the Two Roads Bureau should present it to the Ministry of Railways for inspection and acceptance. Since the offices of the Two Roads Transportation Office were destroyed, temporary office buildings have been built near the station. Now that the new house has been completed, it is scheduled to move in completely tomorrow (i.e., September 1) and start working.</p>
<h3>Invite all Sectors of Society</h3>
<p>As for the completion of the North Station and the supplementary opening ceremony of the Two Roads Business Office, it was originally scheduled to be held at the North Station at the same time on September 1 (i.e., tomorrow). Now, due to the delay of the project, it is impossible to do so, so it has been decided to postpone the event. At the same time, the bureau will schedule a time to invite people from all walks of life to visit the new site.</p>
<h3>Lee Wai Pak and Fan Wan Chiu Dispute Over Drawing of Provincial Government Plan of Kwangtung</h3>
<p>Original plan drawn by Lee Wai Pak</p>
<p>Fan claims that Lee assisted with the drawing</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Wan Chiu, a famous architect of this port, recently the Government of Kwangtung Province was planning to construct a provincial government building. They advertised and sought design plans for the government building, and Mr. Fan's design was selected, for which he will receive $8,000 for being chosen as first place according to the rules. However, for this design, when Mr. Fan presented it, he said that he was assisted by Mr. Lee Wai Pak with the drawing, however due to this matter, Mr. Lee has already departed for Kwangtung, where he will be in negotiations with Mr. Fan. Based on what Mr. Lee had said, when the Kwangtung provincial government had sought for the design plans, he had returned to Shanghai from the Americas. At the time, Mr. Fan had asked Lee to draw the design plan, and Lee had taken on the responsibility of creating the drafts, and it took him three months to complete it. Because Lee was in Kwangtung at the time, and did not have a communications address, he gave the design to Fan. However, after Fan had received the design, he wrote a code on the plan, and used the name of Fan's Shanghai Surveying and Mapping Office and mailed it to the Kwangtung Provincial Government. Also, Fan said that Lee had assisted in the drafting of the plan. When it was announced that he was chosen for first place, Fan did not tell Mr. Lee, and went alone to Kwangtung province, but Mr. Lee found out about it soon after, and also tracked down to Kwangtung, where he is negotiating with Fan. He has also expressed his willingness to make concessions, and wished to have half of the award money, however Fan had refused, saying that the plan was submitted under the name of the surveying office, and the award should be received under the name of the office. Currently based on the report of Mr. Lee who had written a letter from Kwangtung to Shanghai, he has hired Kwangtung's lawyer Du Zhi Ding, who wrote a letter to the director of the Kwangtung Construction Bureau, Lin Wun Kai, declaring that the award money should only be given after both he and Mr. Fan had signed it. The letter is written below: Mr. Lin of the Kwangtung Construction Bureau, the involved party Lee Wai Pak said that last November he had returned to Shanghai from the Americas, and had learned that the provincial government was seeking for design plans, and so he and Mr. Fan Wan Chiu jointly proposed drafting a plan, with Wai Pak to be responsible for it, and drafted a plan to send to the province. At the time, he did not have an address in Shanghai, and so they still wrote the Fan Jun Office when the plan was sent, and Wai Pak is not an employee of that office. Afterwards with Mr. Xu Jingzhi and Mr. Yang Rujun, he had formed the Xingye Architect Office at No. 19, Museum Road, Shanghai, which he had informed your office for review. Please send the information about the reward money and project progress to this address. I have also heard that the design has been ranked first place, and the award will be given in the day. The design should be listed under the names of Mr. Fan and Wai Pak together. Please inform them etc., this lawyer has confirmed that this is the truth. Hereby informing you, that in the future, to issue the award money, please order Fan Wan Zhao to come together with Lee Wai Pak to receive it, so that no argument can be made, so that the friendship is preserved, Lawyer Du Zhi Ding.</p>
<h3>Municipal Works Bureau Implements a Method for Landowners to Fill Land in the City Center District</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the Greater Shanghai Plan, the Municipal Works Bureau has devoted all its efforts to the construction of the city center area. Most of the road, ditch, and bridge projects within the two land reclamation areas have been completed. The solemn and beautiful new Municipal Government Building is about to be completed, and the office buildings of various bureaus have also been completed. It is heard that the Municipal Government, in order to encourage citizens to build houses, will exempt those who build houses in the city center area from paying house donations for two years. The Municipal Works Bureau also has regulations for handling soil filling. Because after the construction of roads in the area, the land on both sides has become low-lying. It is not possible to engage in construction unless it is filled to a considerable degree. If the soil filling work is carried out by the individual owners, it will not only be difficult to obtain soil, but also the labor costs will be high, which is extremely uneconomical. Now that the bureau is planning to handle it comprehensively, it is a great convenience. The method for handling the soil filling is a total of five articles: "㈠ If the landowners want to raise the foundation, they can first submit it to the Municipal Works Bureau for registration. ㈡ The land height is determined by the Works Bureau. If it needs to be raised or lowered according to regulations, it should be declared in advance during registration. ㈢ The soil filling project is handled by the Works Bureau bidding on behalf of the owners. The landowners pay the soil price according to the bid price. ㈣ The labor cost for the required soil filling is estimated by the Works Bureau in advance and notified. The applicant pays three-quarters of the total amount in advance. This amount is collected by the Municipal Center Expense Management Committee on behalf of the applicant. After the project is completed, the contractor and the applicant inspect and accept the project, and then pay the soil price according to the actual measured amount. ㈤ If there is a dispute during the receipt of the soil, the review estimate of the Works Bureau shall be the standard, and neither party shall have any objection." Since the promulgation of this method, landowners such as the Shanghai Bank have requested that it be handled on their behalf and have been very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>The Axe Murder Case of Fang Jianfei, the Accused Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Fang Jianfei, the Standing Director of the Shoe-Making Industry Workers' Union, was attacked and injured in Renzhili, North Sichuan Road, at 9 p.m. on the 14th of this month. The Municipal Party Department sent Lu Yinchu to Fang's dormitory to inspect the injuries and inquire about the cause of the attack, and expressed condolences. The arrested criminals, Lin Cai and others, were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for trial. On the morning of the 22nd, the retrial was held. Because Fang Jianfei and Fan Yiqiang, who were injured, were still in the hospital and had not recovered, they could not appear in court. The trial was postponed to 10 a.m. on the 29th in the Third Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer stated the case, and then the plaintiffs, Fang Jianfei and Fan Yiqiang, reported the process. After the debate, Lin Cai was sentenced on the spot to six months' imprisonment for crimes such as injuring lives and disrupting the labor movement.</p>
<h3>The Journalists Association Held an Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association held an Executive Committee meeting at the association's clubhouse at 5 p.m. yesterday. Yan Esheng, Pei Shunyuan, Zhao Junhao, Wu Zhongyi, Gu Zhizhong, Yu Kongwo, Qian Hua, Qu Shaoyi, and Li Zutan were present. Zhao Junhao chaired the meeting, and Wu Zhongyi recorded the minutes. Various cases were discussed at the meeting. Regarding the case of member Li Zutan being insulted in Ningbo, it was resolved that: According to member Li's report, the inspection soldier was indeed inappropriate. However, Jin Zhenxiang of the Ningbo Shibao newspaper sent a letter to member Li on the 28th, stating that, in addition to the conditions mentioned, Councilor Zhou Dalie of the department had apologized in person, and now attached 10 yuan to compensate for the loss of one day of delay and the loss of one yuan halfway. As for punishing the perpetrator, the commander had also investigated the officers and soldiers involved and given them reprimands and fines. Please settle the matter in Ningbo, etc. Member Li immediately sent the 10 yuan back to Mr. Jin, hoping that the inspection soldiers would use a peaceful, proper, and reasonable way to exercise their powers for general passengers in the future. The member now acknowledges Mr. Jin's mediation, does not want to insist on anything, and is willing to respect the good intentions of the mediator. Since Member Li is willing to follow the purpose of settling the matter in Ningbo and accept Mr. Jin's advice, the association should record it and file it, and not send another letter.</p>
<h3>Qian Yizhang's Funeral was Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central Government sent a representative to pay tribute</p>
<p>Qian Yizhang (i.e., Huang Yonghua), the Standing Committee Member of the China Seamen's Special Party Department and the Director of the Special Group of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, was extremely serious in handling his duties, which led to the jealousy of the Communists. He was assassinated at the New New Hotel at 10 p.m. on the 25th of this month. The funeral was jointly organized by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Seamen's Special Party Department at the Public Security Bureau. The funeral was held at the Chinese Funeral Home on Haige Road at 2 p.m. yesterday. The situation is briefly recorded below:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, based on a report from Peng Shanhou, the battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the Military Police, stated that Wei Guobin, a private first class in the 3rd Machine Gun Company of this regiment, had reported that his family lived in Zhabei, Shanghai. Now, someone had come to the company to say that his younger brother was critically ill and begged to be allowed to take leave to visit him. On the 20th of this month, he was granted one day of personal leave and ordered to go in plain clothes. By the morning of the 21st, he had not returned to the company. 2nd Lieutenant Yu Songsheng and Sergeant Xu Caiming were sent to inquire at his home. Only then did they learn that his younger brother had already died. According to his father, his younger son had an argument last night over money problems and had gone out and not returned. On the same day, they received a letter from the soldier, stating that his younger brother had died, that he had no money for the funeral, that his grandmother was critically ill and he could not care for her, and that he was filled with despair about the future and only wished to die. The soldier had boarded the Zhengtai steamship and decided to go to the Wusongkou to drown himself in the river. However, inquiries with the shipping company revealed that there was no such incident. Military and police authorities are currently searching in separate directions.</p>
<h3>Yu Huizhao, Former Magistrate of Jinjiang County, Fujian, Arrested in Shanghai for Embezzling Funds During His Tenure</h3>
<p>Will Be Escorted Back to Fujian to Be Prosecuted According to Law</p>
<p>The Fujian Department of Finance stated that Yu Huizhao (from Jiangxi), the former magistrate of Jinjiang County in the province, embezzled public funds during his tenure, including over ten thousand in funds for the airfield and road construction, and had not reported them to higher authorities. After the case was discovered, the provincial government issued an arrest warrant. Yu went into hiding and came to Shanghai a month ago. Shen Wenda, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, discovered his whereabouts and urgently reported to Captain Lu. Detective Jiao Baojun and Zhu Fusheng were dispatched, together with detectives from the French Concession's Lujiawan Police Station, all in disguise, to No. 1 Cishou South Lane on Avenue Joffre. Detective Shen, disguised as a tea waiter, claimed to be sent by a certain Master Shi from a certain room at the Greater China Hotel, asking Magistrate Yu to come for a talk. He was received by a Mr. Xu, who believed it to be true and replied that Yu was currently residing at No. 10 Yongqing Lane on Rue Béthune and could be reached directly. Shen and the others then went to the address, where they found Yu Huizhao reading a newspaper in the parlor. They immediately arrested him and took him into custody. Later, Yu claimed to be ill and requested bail, and offered to immediately send someone to Fujian to handle the procedures from his tenure, but the request was denied. It is now known that the Fujian Department of Finance has commissioned Mo Wenhui to bring a document to Shanghai to escort him back. It is said that Director Wen has approved, so Mo is scheduled to take Yu on the Huaan steamer this week to Fuzhou to be prosecuted according to law.</p>
<h3>Wife Urges Husband to Return Home from a Mahjong Game at a Friend's House, Is Humiliated, and Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Zhou Xue, a woman from Ningbo, 22 years old, lived at No. 130, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road. Her husband, Zhou Shoukang, used to work in the stock exchange, but is now unemployed at home. One morning around 1:00 AM, Zhou was playing mahjong at a friend's house for fun. Because her husband had not returned late at night, Ms. Zhou went to the place to urge her husband to return home with her. Unexpectedly, Zhou not only refused to listen but also humiliated and scolded his wife. Unable to do anything, Ms. Zhou returned home alone. After much thought, she was filled with resentment and despair and conceived a desire to end her life. She secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Her husband noticed and sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported it to the police station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Phylun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to conduct an examination and determined that the cause of death was suicide. According to Zhou Shoukang, the husband of the deceased, he was playing mahjong at a friend's house that day and the game was not yet over. His wife suddenly came and ordered him to return home. Because he was concerned about his reputation in front of his friends at that time, he scolded her slightly. He did not expect her to commit suicide after returning home. After hearing his statement, Guo concluded that the deceased, Zhou Xue, died of opium poisoning before her death. The body was released to her husband, Zhou Shoukang, to be placed in a coffin for burial after he signed a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Liuhe Will Rebuild the New and Old Floating Bridges</h3>
<p>First Committee Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The new and old floating bridges in Liuhe were previously damaged in the war and have suffered from disrepair over the years. Many of the bridge timbers are broken, making it very dangerous for pedestrians. Therefore, the local gentry and merchants organized a Bridge Construction Committee to find ways to rebuild them. The first committee meeting was held yesterday, attended by more than twenty people including Xiang Ganbo, Lu Renxi, Zhong Yinsheng, Qian Baichuan, Mei Youzhi, Huang Songsheng, Zhu Kaichou, and Wu Zhongyi. Mao Lupu was elected as chairman. After the formalities were completed, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Zhu Kaichou reported that the construction of the old floating bridge is planned to use reinforced concrete, costing about 18,000 silver dollars. The new floating bridge will cost about 12,000 silver dollars. Except for the negotiations with various parties, there are already about seven or eight thousand silver dollars in sight, but there is still a significant shortage. He hopes that the gentlemen present will work hard to solicit donations so that it can be completed soon. Next, Xiang Huaqing said that he owned a residence located on the west side of the North Stone Bridge in Liuhe Town, and after selling it, he would use the entire amount to fund the bridge construction. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) Zhu Kaichou proposed that the construction of the two bridges was originally planned to be carried out simultaneously, but due to economic constraints, the old floating bridge should be rebuilt first, and the old materials removed from the old floating bridge should be temporarily repaired and used for the new floating bridge to save money. The resolution was passed. (2) Zhang Lunqing proposed that because it is not easy to raise funds, a bridge should be built in a central location between the two bridges. The resolution involved changing the transportation plan, and the opinions of the majority of the local people should be sought, and a proposal should be submitted to the county government. (3) Zhu Kaichou proposed that Lu Renxi be appointed as the engineer for the reconstruction of the two bridges. The resolution was passed. (4) Zhu Kaichou proposed that the committee members personally send the donation registers to the absent committee members. It was resolved to appoint Song Kaichou and Huang Songsheng as representatives to personally send the donation registers. (5) The chairman proposed that the Second District Office should submit the bridge construction plan to the county for record. The proposal was passed. Finally, Zhang Lunqing, Xiang Huaqing, Fu Yongyan, Wang Puhuan, Zhong Yinsheng, and Zhu Kaichou were appointed as economic committee members, and Lu Renxi, Huang Songsheng, Wu Zhongyi, Zhu Qizhan, and Huang Qiusheng were appointed as engineering committee members, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Completion of the Jinrong Bridge in Caohejing</h3>
<p>Traffic Ceremony to Be Held on September 1</p>
<p>A stone bridge in the east market of Caohejing Town, Shanghai, was inconvenient for vehicles due to its height and narrowness. Therefore, a road was built on the south side of the bridge, connecting Caoxi Road to the east and Bijiao Road to the west, reaching the Huang Family Garden. It was a major east-west thoroughfare. This spring, due to the opening of a new port and dredging of the north and south rivers, the original stone bridge was demolished, and the roadbed that had been used to fill the road was also dredged due to the waterway. It was necessary to build another bridge to facilitate transportation and benefit navigation. However, the river surface was wide, requiring a large amount of money. The municipal government was unable to plan for it for a time due to financial constraints. Later, Mr. Huang Jinrong independently donated 6,500 silver dollars. The Bureau of Public Works contracted Qian Yongji to build a reinforced concrete bridge. Construction has been underway for three months and all projects are now complete. A traffic ceremony will be held on September 1, and it will be named Jinrong Bridge.</p>

<h3>Annual Conference of the China Library Association</h3>
<p>Request that Schools and Public Libraries Seek Independent Funding</p>
<p>Next Annual Conference to Be Held in Wuchang, Hangzhou, or Guangzhou</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Second Annual Conference of the China Library Association opened on the 28th in the auditorium of Tsinghua University in the suburbs of Beiping. Party, government, and education officials all attended the conference. The annual conference ceremony was held at 9:00 AM and adjourned at 11:10 AM. Group meetings of the administrative group were held from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. On the 29th (the second day), the funding group meeting was originally scheduled to be held at the Biology Museum at 8:00 AM, but due to the rain, the committee members living in the city were unable to arrive in time, and the meeting was changed to 2:00 PM in the afternoon. However, the meeting for the discussion of association affairs was still held at 10:00 AM in the morning, and the location was changed to the Third Academy. The Second Annual Conference of the China Library Association is a general gathering of library experts from all over the country and has made a great contribution to education and culture. The reporter made a special trip of more than twenty li for several days to attend the conference at Tsinghua University. The reporter received the warm reception of the chairmen of the association, Yuan Tongli, Wang Wenshan, and Shen Zurong, as well as the members of the reception group. The details of the association are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 28th, the association held a general meeting at Tsinghua University. The venue was set up in the Tsinghua University auditorium. The chairmen of the association, Yuan Tongli, Wang Wenshan, and Shen Zurong, and the guests Yuan Liang, Zhao Shuyong, and Fan Jichang, etc., were on the stage. The first row below the stage was the reporter's seat, and the second row was also the reporter's seat, but there were no reporters present. The third row was the seat for female members, including Ms. Lu Xiaoxin, and the rows after that were for the members' seats. After the meeting began, the Tsinghua Military Band played music and performed the formalities. The chairmen of the association jointly elected Yuan Tongli, the deputy director of the Beiping Library, to deliver the opening speech.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Yuan briefly stated that today, the Second Annual Conference of the China Library Association is held at Tsinghua University. It is a great honor to have the party, government, and education officials and guests attend the conference. The China Library Association was established in June 1925, and the first annual conference was held in Nanjing in January 1929. This year's second annual conference is held in Beiping. It is not easy to gather librarians from all over the country in one hall. There are three difficulties: (1) The association's funds are insufficient. (2) Due to the situation, the scheduled dates often have to be postponed. (3) There are many proposals for the annual conference, and it takes a long time to implement them. The scope of discussion for this annual conference is limited to funding and public education, which has already been explained in the declaration of the Second Annual Conference. Now, I would like to add a few points: (1) In terms of architecture, the libraries of Tsinghua University, the National Beiping Library, the Guangzhou City Library, and the Zhejiang Provincial Library in Hangzhou all have magnificent and luxurious buildings. (2) In terms of content, the purchase of books by Beiping City has an annual budget of more than 500,000, totaling more than 2 million in four years. Book purchases are divided into labor and cooperation, with mutual contact. (3) In terms of public education, public education has developed in the past four years, and the number of public libraries has increased. The number of public libraries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has increased, and public libraries in Hebei and Shandong have also gradually been added due to the impact of the popularization of public education. There has been progress in both quality and quantity. The only point of dissatisfaction is funding. The funding situation varies from place to place, and the two Guangs cannot develop evenly. Libraries in the interior are lagging behind. The mission of the association is to enable libraries across the country to develop simultaneously and to provide scholars in the interior with research opportunities. The funding of libraries is beyond the capacity of librarians and requires the assistance of local authorities. In recent years, China's construction projects have been concentrated in cities, and the bourgeoisie has entered the cities, resulting in a deformed development. This is not a good phenomenon. In the future, we will concentrate the strength of the whole country and proceed towards the countryside to ensure that the people have the opportunity to read books and develop public libraries.</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Opinion: Huang Fu delivered a speech on behalf of Zhao Shuyong, briefly stating that he was very honored to participate in the grand meeting on behalf of Chairman Huang. China is originally the oldest country in terms of culture and academics. The China Library Association focuses on the library, an important part of culture and academics. The future restoration of Chinese culture depends entirely on the library community. The Chinese have the following concepts about books: (1) Pay attention to Song editions. Some people will not read anything other than Song editions. (2) Collation and printing. Judge the quality of the published editions. (3) Collectors specialize in collecting ancient books. Today's libraries pay attention to public education. Popular books are also collected, and printing books is also very important. The Ministry of Education printed a shadow copy of the Siku Quanshu, and library experts contributed their opinions. At present, only a few people have this view. I hope that in the future, people across the country will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: (1) Pang Jingtang, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech with the following main points: (1) Villagers have no opportunity to seek knowledge and cannot even maintain their lives. (2) Relics other than the Siku Quanshu, national ideology, Qing documents, and the history of aggression in the last three hundred years should all be paid attention to. (2) Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang delivered a speech: (1) Library science is a specialized field, and this subject should be established in universities to promote culture. (2) In 1930, there were more than 2,900 libraries nationwide. This year, the number has doubled. (3) He hopes for two points: (a) To increase the effectiveness of library services; (b) To expand the library itself. (3) Tsinghua President Mei Yiqi delivered a speech: (1) Welcome the members of the China Library Association to hold a meeting at our school. (2) Report on the situation of the Tsinghua University Library. (3) Ask the members of the association for guidance. (4) Peking University President Jiang Menglin delivered a speech on behalf of Fan Jichang: (1) Various undertakings in China want to be done but have not been completed, but libraries have made great progress. (2) The equipment of libraries in various schools is incomplete. I hope that the association will support the research of teachers and students in various schools. (5) Li Shizeng, Director of the Beiping Research Institute, delivered a speech on behalf of Li Shengzhang: (1) The process of the establishment of the International Library. (2) The purpose of the International Library is to communicate Chinese and Western cultures. (3) The situation of cultural exchange between China and other countries.</p>
<p>Member's Reply: Liu Guojun was elected by the members to deliver a reply, briefly stating that he was grateful to the party, government, education officials, and guests for their instruction at the opening of the Second Annual Conference of the China Library Association. He expressed his gratitude on behalf of all the members. Eight years ago, the association was established in Beiping with the guidance of the government. Eight years later, the meeting was held again in Beiping and guidance was received again. It is a great honor and allows the members to visit the unscheduled scenery. The members will always remember the instructions of the speakers. Libraries promote culture, and Chinese culture will develop simultaneously. We will work harder for the library cause. What the Chinese nation invented: (1) Papermaking. It was invented during the Eastern Han Dynasty. The West had paper more than a thousand years later. (2) Printing. China invented printing in the second half of the Han Dynasty. The West was five hundred years later than China. What is China's current position? Can we bear this cultural responsibility and make the world's culture uplifted by China in the future? Without papermaking and printing, there would be no libraries. Finally, Li Wenqi, a member of the preparatory committee, reported on the arrangements for the group meetings. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Administrative Group</h3>
<p>First, at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the Library Administrative Group meeting was held in the Tsinghua Biology Museum. More than sixty committee members, including Yuan Tongli, Hong Youfeng, Feng Chen Zuyi, and Yao Jinzhong, attended. Yuan Tongli presided over the meeting and passed the following resolutions: (1) It is recommended that the provincial library should be the highest administrative executive agency of the provincial library and protect its administrative and administrative financial independence. The resolution was to appoint representatives from the libraries of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Tianjin, and the original proposer to revise it and submit it to the next meeting. (2) Consider opening school libraries to integrate school books with society and subsidize adult education. The resolution was that the China Library Association should send a letter to the library of each school to consider opening it to the public for reading outside the school. (3) The Association should reward those who are enthusiastic and hardworking in the library cause. The resolution was to hand it over to the Executive Committee of the Association for handling. (4) Examine and approve the library administrator to promote the progress of the library cause. The resolution was to send it to the Library Education Group for combined discussion. (5) The staff members of various libraries in the country can exchange travel expenses and observation fees. The resolution was to pass it according to the original plan. (6) Libraries should also expand publicity methods to seek business development. Resolution: The first item of the original proposal, "Each library should specify an item for publicity expenses in its budget," was canceled, and the following were changed to one, two, three, and four in order. The last item was changed to "Each year, a national library movement week will be held on a specified date." (7) Please order the public libraries of each province, city, and county to set up a circulating book department. The resolution was that the association would again recommend that the public libraries of each province, city, and county set up a circulating department. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Meeting Resolutions</h3>
<p>On the second day (the 29th), the meeting of the council was held at 10:00 AM in the Third Hall of Tsinghua University. Over two hundred members attended, chaired by Dai Zhiqian, with Yuan Tongli acting as secretary. First, the chairman reported that the executive department of the association must compile a report annually to notify all members. As usual, the report is published in the first issue of each volume of the association journal. The annual report has already been published in the first issue of Volume 9. Members are requested to examine it themselves. Today's discussion will focus on how the association should develop. Based on personal experience, there are four reasons why the association has not been able to develop in recent years: (1) insufficient funding; (2) inability to hire full-time staff to take charge; (3) members are mostly serving in various libraries, making it difficult to concentrate on assisting the association, and executive committee members are scattered in different locations, making it difficult to convene meetings, rendering the committee virtually non-existent; (4) the publication of journals is often delayed due to members' lack of enthusiasm in submitting articles. It is proposed to use these four reasons for the lack of development as the focus of today's discussion, discussing them item by item. Next, the following resolutions were passed: (1) Resolution on the association's endowment fund: Fundraising methods include: (a) the association's institutional members and individual members will donate funds based on their income, according to the principle of proportion; (b) establish a fundraising committee, inviting enthusiastic library professionals from all walks of life to join as members; (c) send letters to central and local administrative agencies for subsidies; (d) after a certain amount has been raised, request subsidies from the Sino-British and Sino-American Foundations; (e) the association will establish an endowment fund management committee to be solely responsible for endowment fund management; (f) donations will be published in the association's journal and major newspapers in Shanghai and elsewhere; (g) detailed rules for the management committee will be determined separately. (2) Resolution on the location of the next annual meeting: Choose one of Wuchang, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou. (3) Resolution on the association immediately organizing a library weekly or shortening the publication period of the association journal to promote library services and disseminate library news: Resolved, to be handled by the editorial department taking into consideration the actual situation. (3) Resolution on stipulating that the association's office staff should be full-time positions to increase the efficiency of association affairs: Resolved, to be handled by the executive committee at its discretion. (4) Resolution on the association establishing a library personnel registration and referral department: Resolved, to be handled by the executive committee. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>

<p>Departing for Chengdu, Public Lectures on Scientific Development</p>
<p>Splitting Up to Investigate and Collect Samples in Zigong and Mount Emei</p>
<p>Next Annual Meeting to be Held in Either Gan (Jiangxi), Jing (Nanjing), or Hu (Shanghai)</p>
<p>The 18th meeting of the Science Society of China has been held in Chongqing, Sichuan Province, and the Jialing River Hot Spring Park since the 17th of this month. The warm welcome from various circles in the local area and the opening of the conference have been reported in previous news reports. It is now learned that all members of the society departed for Chengdu on the 22nd, and from the 25th, they split up to investigate and collect samples in Zigong, Mount Emei, and other places. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>The educational circles hosted a banquet for all members of the Science Society of China. In the early morning of the 21st, they returned to Chongqing from the Jialing River Hot Spring Park. At noon, Chongqing University, the Sichuan Rural Construction College, and the East Sichuan Co-educational Normal School hosted a banquet at Yongnianchun to express their welcome. During the banquet, Gan Diankui, Vice President of Chongqing University, delivered a welcome speech. The society publicly elected Dr. Bing Nongshan to respond with gratitude. In the afternoon, they split into three groups to visit: (1) the Chongqing Copper Coin Bureau; (2) the Central Agricultural Farm; (3) the Waterworks. Staff members from each field and factory guided and explained the facilities, which were considered relatively complete. In the evening at 6:00 PM, the society's annual meeting held a banquet at the Appropriate Garden to thank various agencies and organizations in Chongqing. Departing for Chengdu on the morning of the 22nd, all members of the society departed by car for Chengdu. The military headquarters specially sent adjutants to take care of them along the way. On the 23rd and 24th, large-scale public lectures were held in Chengdu. Bing Nongshan and six others were appointed to visit Liu Chengfu, the military supervisor, and other military leaders to discuss scientific development issues in Sichuan Province. Seven people were responsible for the public lectures: (1) Wang Jiliang spoke on the importance of scientific research; (2) He Kuigui spoke on science education; (3) He Dekui spoke on the causes of global commercial depression and ways to remedy it; (4) Bing Nongshan spoke on zoology and life; (5) Hu Buzeng spoke on botany and life; (6) Hu Boyuan spoke on the relationship between steel and national defense and industry; (7) Lu Yudao spoke on the brain and knowledge. The audience was very enthusiastic and showed great interest.</p>
<p>Grouping for Investigation On the morning of the 25th, the society members set out in three routes to investigate industry, collect specimens, and survey geography. One route went to Zigong, one route went to Mount Emei, and one route went to Guang'an. This conference held by the society in Sichuan Province left a very deep impression on the military and political authorities and the people of Sichuan. Because Sichuan Province has a new impetus for unification, and domestic scientists happened to arrive at this time, the atmosphere of scientific development permeated the entire province, refreshing the mind and uplifting the spirit. Therefore, this trip not only provided the people of Sichuan with scientific knowledge, but its relationship to the development of rich resources in the southwest is also profound and significant.</p>
<p>Next Annual Meeting At the next annual meeting, upon the proposal of Dr. Hu Xian　, a member, and passed by the general meeting, it was decided that Lushan in Jiangxi Province would be one of the locations for next year's annual meeting. Other proposed locations are Nanjing and Shanghai. Because next year is the 20th anniversary of the society, it is also necessary to hold the meeting at the location of the society's headquarters. It is heard that the board of directors will make the final decision in March or April next year. It is also said that the out-of-province members in Sichuan will leave Sichuan by the Minguilun ship on September 5th.</p>

<h3>More Registrations for the National Games Yesterday</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese from the Philippines and Athletes from Sichuan</p>

<h3>Shandong to Participate in the National Games with Track and Field All-Around</h3>
<p>Decision Not to Send Swimming and Ball Teams</p>
<p>丨丨North China Ball Games Cannot Expand Facilities丨丨</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) This province originally planned to participate in this year's National Games by selecting all-around track and field athletes for both men and women, as well as representative teams for various ball games, and had also built a swimming pool to prepare to send swimming athletes. Unexpectedly, the Yellow River caused damage, and western Shandong has become a flooded country. The provincial government and local disaster relief are overwhelmed, and the preliminary selection for the National Games has been reduced in scope. After continuous consultations between the Department of Education and the competition director of the National Games preliminary selection preparatory committee, Shang Shumei, it has been decided that the National Games preliminary selection meeting will only be held for three days from September 15th to 17th to select all-around track and field athletes for both men and women. Ball teams will not be selected. Schools with swimming competitions can also compete, but athletes will not be sent.</p>
<p>Also, this year's winter vacation, the North China Football and Basketball Games, has been decided to be held in Jinan. The North China Sports Federation had previously telegraphed to request proper facilities, so the sports field prepared to build a gym with tens of thousands of yuan last month, and had requested drawings from Tsinghua University, and repaired the three-sided stands of the ball field, but recently it has also been suspended due to the flood. Shang Shumei, the director of the sports field, will go to Beijing in the next few days to attend the North China Sports Federation. The Department of Education is preparing an official letter to be entrusted to Shang to take with him, which mainly states that if the football and basketball games this year are held in Shandong, they are still very welcome, but this province has suffered a severe flood and cannot make expanded and perfect facilities.</p>
<h3>China Wins Over Portugal in the First Round of the Roper Cup Doubles</h3>
<p>Result 3 to 1</p>
<p>丨丨Chinese Players' Performance is Mediocre丨丨</p>
<p>The first round of the Roper Cup international doubles tennis match, China vs. Portugal, was held at the Chinese Club at 4:30 PM yesterday. Due to Jiang Daozhang's decline, Qiu Feihai was unable to support the situation alone. Although China eliminated Portugal by a score of 3 to 1, the performance was mediocre, and the prospects are bleak, so there is no reason to be optimistic. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Six丨Three</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai Six丨Four S. Colaca</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang Five丨Seven Costantine</p>
<p>Six丨One</p>
<p>The first three sets ended without a winner being determined. But at this time, the sky was dark, and the spectators dispersed like birds and beasts, but the game continued as usual, groping in the dark. Winning or losing depends on luck and misfortune. As a result, China ended with six to one and won the final victory with three to one sets.</p>
<p>The victory of China in the first two sets was still easy, but Jiang Daozhang's many unforgivable mistakes greatly reduced the interest in the game. In the second set, China took the lead with three to one, and then the wins and losses were mutual, and the situation was even. Fortunately, China laid the foundation first, and was able to win six to four. In the third set, Jiang's mistakes increased, and the Portuguese players were able to win seven to five. Qiu and Jiang won the fourth set six to one again in the dark.</p>

<h3>Publication of "Methods for Implementing Health Education" Edited by Wang Geng</h3>
<p>Individual ill-health inevitably leads to unemployment, non-productivity, suffering, and poverty. National ill-health inevitably leads to national spirit decline, national weakness, societal corruption, and frequent foreign invasions. Recognizing this, the central government has been actively promoting health education for the populace in recent days. However, in this nascent stage, there are no specialized books on this subject within the country, leaving those engaged in general health education without a reference. This is deeply regrettable. Now, the Qinfen Bookstore at 392 Rue du Père Robert (opposite the National Sports Advancement Association) in the French Concession of Shanghai has engaged Mr. Wang Geng, Director of Physical Education at the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute, to edit "Methods for Implementing Health Education." The book is now published. Mr. Wang has been involved in health education for many years and is rich in both knowledge and experience. The content of this work is comprehensive, and the evidence presented is accurate. It can be considered his masterpiece. Furthermore, it has been implemented for many years in the Wuxi Experimental Zone and is highly practical. The entire book is divided into two parts, upper and lower, with four chapters in the upper part and six chapters in the lower part, each chapter further divided into sections. Chapter 1, "The Physiological Basis of Healthy Habits," includes ten sections on food, large muscle exercise, sleep, air and ventilation, excretion, and more. Chapter 2, "Basic Knowledge of Disease Prevention," includes seven sections on the sources of disease and microorganisms, opportunities for bacteria to enter the human body, what happens after bacteria enter the human body, and the phenomena of infectious diseases. Chapter 3, "Preventive Medical Health," Section 1 covers diseases that can be completely prevented or treated with certainty, including eleven points on diphtheria, smallpox, cholera, dysentery, hookworm disease, etc. Section 2 covers diseases that can be prevented by isolating patients or carriers, including twelve points on tuberculosis, pneumonia, whooping cough, measles, etc. Section 3 covers diseases that can be prevented by improving lifestyle habits, including six points on diabetes, gout, stroke, etc. Section 4 covers diseases that can be prevented by popularizing public health education, including eleven points on malnutrition, neurasthenia, indigestion, etc. Chapter 4, "Publicity for Public Health Undertakings," includes four points on who our target audience for publicity is, etc. The lower part covers public health guidance. Chapter 1, "Public Health and Vital Statistics," includes seven points on infant mortality, accidental deaths, population statistics, disease statistics, etc. Chapter 2, "The Administrative System of Public Health," includes seven sections on a brief description of the public health administrative organization, etc. Chapter 3 includes six sections on a brief description of food types and methods for food identification, etc. Chapter 4, "Three Major Issues in Public Health," includes three sections on the disposal of water, feces, and waste, etc. Chapter 5 includes five sections on clothing, housing, bathing, hairdressing, and soil, etc. Chapter 6, "The Formulation of Health Regulations," includes ten sections on the training of old-style midwives, cleaning roads, banning toilets, and restaurants, etc. The entire work spans over 100,000 words and includes dozens of accurate charts and diagrams.

<h3>Diary of the Wimbledon World Tennis Championships (8)</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent in London, Yizhi</p>
<p>July 5th (Wednesday), continued from yesterday</p>
<p>Although the first two sets were close, Crawford controlled the situation. There were more errors in this match than in the previous one. For example, in the first set, Sato and Crawford were tied 2-2. Crawford missed four easy volleys. Sato won the opponent's serve to lead 4-3. Crawford then took the lead at 5-3 through two net cords and a double fault from Sato due to bad luck, winning the set 6-3. In the second set, after 3-3, Sato improved, but Crawford still won 6-4. Sato's luck was particularly bad. At 4-5, he only needed two points to make it 5-5 but touched the net twice.</p>
<p>Crawford took the opportunity to advance. Some of his errors were inexcusable. Sato was much improved in the third set, winning five games in a row. Crawford's attempts to approach the net were all passed. Crawford was down 0-30 on his serve, and it seemed Sato would win the set easily, but Crawford took six and seven games. Then, Crawford's service game was full of countless errors, not winning a single point.</p>
<p>In the first five games of the fourth set, the server lost each time. The match gradually improved, with good and bad shots from both sides. At 4-4, Sato served, and the battle intensified. They went back and forth. Sato double-faulted, giving Crawford a point lead but then touched the net and followed with a shot out. Sato took the lead again, but he sent one of his easiest backhand smashes into the net. Sato looked disappointed, while Crawford shouted in extreme horror. Crawford then hit a shot to the baseline, breaking this important service game and taking a 5-4 lead. He then won the next game.</p>
<p>Crawford deserved the victory. He was able to remain calm and steady during critical moments, not missing any shots, and placed his shots accurately. He was affected in the fourth set by being trapped in a bad situation in the third set and gradually became impatient, missing very easy shots. Sato made similar errors, double-faulting, sending shots into the net, and missing two easy smashes. He took risks by approaching the net and increasing his speed in the fourth set, which was surprising. This match was full of powerful shots. Crawford's performance was slightly inferior to Sato's at the end.</p>
<p>Andrew and Stenteman, who defeated Tonber and Questro, lost to Krahmn and Nona in four sets. They won the first set and tried hard to win the second and third sets but failed. Both Krahmn and Nona had powerful shots and good smashes, but Stenteman's serve was slightly weaker. Nona, who is black and small, is much worse than Krahmn, but his angle shots are particularly useful. Krahmn is good, but makes too many errors. Ms. Land and Sanshou Kanki defeated Ms. Kai and Tonber. Kai was much less impressive. Mrs. Gofre and Mrs. Mikel continued to win, defeating Mrs. Burke and Ms. Thomas in two sets.</p>

<h3>What Happened to Yang Hengchun?</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Who is Yang Hengchun? He is an unknown person. His name only briefly appeared in the newspapers, so it's natural that he wouldn't leave much of an impression on people's minds. Now, I'll extract a short news item from the newspapers of August 6th as an introduction:</p>
<p>"Yesterday morning, a daytime robbery occurred in the City God Temple in the city... The victim, Wu Ma Shi, cried out for help, and the robbers shot and injured her left leg... At that moment, Yang Hengchun, a Shandong native and employee of the Xinyi Zhai bird shop on Liangting Road, heard the cries and gave chase, grabbing one of the robbers. He was also shot by another robber, the bullet hitting Yang Hengchun in a vital area. His life is in danger, and he has been sent to Tongren Hospital..."</p>
<p>What happened to Yang Hengchun? Did he die? Or was his gunshot wound fortunately healed? Is he still in the hospital? What is his current situation? I think about it every day, but there has been no follow-up in the newspapers! His name has never been revealed in the newspapers again!</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Yang Hengchun's act of upholding justice and eliminating evil is of great significance. Mr. Yang and the robbed Wu Ma Shi were originally strangers. In the eyes of ordinary people, Wu Ma Shi's robbery was unrelated to Mr. Yang. However, from the perspective of social consciousness, the security of society is the responsibility of every citizen. In other words, every citizen should be responsible for suppressing evil and violence to maintain social order, just as every citizen has the sacred duty to defend the country in the face of national survival. Most unfortunately, when the crime occurred, other citizens were concerned about their own personal interests and abandoned their due obligations, standing idly by. Only Mr. Yang, relying on the legacy of chivalry from Qi and Lu, demonstrated the spirit of courage and righteousness on which national survival depends! Therefore, I believe that in this moment when national spirit is dim and depressed, Mr. Yang's actions are of great significance in terms of society, nation, and country and deserve praise and promotion.</p>
<p>We remember that local officials would personally attend the funeral of a police officer who died in the line of duty, and local public organizations would also commemorate and compensate a firefighter who sacrificed himself in the line of duty. But Mr. Yang's courageous actions are of even greater value and significance than those of public officials who die in the line of duty. His life and death deserve attention. But why are the wise local officials and enthusiastic social organizations so indifferent and silent? And why are those great columnists and reporters who pay attention to social news unwilling to spare a few words for this respectable and lovable hero, slightly investigating and describing him, after writing enthusiastically about "玉體橫陳" (jade body lying down) and "一絲不掛" (without a single thread), so-called social news? I dare say that this is the real social news! If this happened in Europe and America or neighboring islands, I believe that large headlines would occupy important space in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Finally, with twelve thousand percent sincerity, I offer the question in the title of this article to the wise officials, the reporters who guide public opinion, the leaders of society, local public organizations, and the general public of men and women with sound reason:</p>
<p>What happened to Yang Hengchun?</p>
<h3>Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>— Hu Liwen</p>
<p>When two people are arguing over the same thing, there is always "right" and "wrong." Either party A is "right" or party B is "right." Either party A is "wrong" or party B is "wrong." There is definitely no such thing as all "right" or all "wrong." However, the people who are arguing will never admit their own "wrong." They always say that they have their own reasons, showering the mediators with so many reasons that they become dizzy and don't know who is "right" and who is "wrong." Although they have good intentions to mediate, they don't have the vision to distinguish "right" and "wrong." As a result, they can only stand by and watch, letting them each insist on their own "right" and each deny their own "wrong."</p>
<p>After France occupied the Nine Islands, our country protested, and Japan also protested. Who is "right" and who is "wrong"? Originally, it could be distinguished by simply looking at the national history. But unfortunately, the Chinese are too indifferent. They don't even understand what their own things look like. Even if China's protest is not entirely "right" and Japan's protest seems "right" but is actually "wrong," the great figures who claim to uphold justice can only pretend to be ignorant and ignore "right" and "wrong." As a result, France recognizes Japan as "right" and appeases them, while recognizing China as "wrong" and turns its back on them.</p>
<p>Alas! In today's world, the strong are "right" and the weak are "wrong." How true these words are! How meaningful these words are!</p>
<h3>On Lian</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>Wan Hua's disciple, Wei Lianfang, has just begun to show her talent. Zhou Lang of Shanghai seems quite melancholy about it. When I first saw her at a banquet at the Hong Kong Grand Theater, she was tall and slender, and I couldn't help but be intrigued. However, after watching her first performance of "Red Thread Stealing the Box," I couldn't help but sigh at my superficial judgment. Her voice is sweet and bright and sufficient, and her performance of mimicking Mei is already full of charm. Her two sword dances are as smooth as swimming dragons and as light as startled geese. Her waist and leg skills seem to require ten years of dedicated training. Judging by this, she can be considered the top of her class among those who study Mei today. And I believe that she is the one who will inherit Mei's legacy in the future.</p>
<h3>Alleyway Chit-Chat</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng (Drunken Fool)</p>
<p>After having dinner, I stood idly outside and felt the heat gradually dissipating. A gentle breeze blew against my clothes, naturally giving me a sense of comfort. At this time, the neighbors on the left and right, men and women, were all lined up cooling off in the alleyway. In this open-air gathering, one often hears descriptive and interesting conversations.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Zhang said: I haven't seen Lingdi from next door for a long time. I guess she's gone back to her mother-in-law's house.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Li said: Don't you know? She officially got married last month. I heard she became a second wife. The husband is in his thirties, has a good character, and is doing well financially. The funniest thing is that her grandmother sent a letter from Songjiang a few days ago, asking her to go back. She said there were few people at home and all the chores were waiting for the daughter-in-law to come back and take care of them. Little did she know that she had already become someone else's daughter-in-law. That old lady is still in the dark! Sister-in-law Zhang looked surprised and said: That's a joke. Someone like Lingdi would also change her mind and get married. She doesn't seem flamboyant or weird at all, but she's become free. It's like saying, "A cat that catches mice doesn't meow."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Li said: You can't blame her. She's a young woman, just like a flower. When she was a bride, she was only eighteen years old. At that time, her husband already had tuberculosis, so she married him to ward off bad luck. Who knew that her husband would die after only two months? She's been a widow ever since, for six or seven years. I heard she's still a "Miss." In today's situation, Song Jie's morality doesn't make much sense. She's able to keep her eyes open and pick a man to marry and start over. That's her good fortune.</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Zhang's face seemed to turn a little red after hearing these words. She couldn't speak for a long time. It turns out she's also a widow "resolving to remain faithful until death"!</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Wang was listening and smiling. Sister-in-law Li turned the conversation and asked: Is your wife's illness any better today? I'm worried about her.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said: Thank you. My wife saw a doctor yesterday, and after taking the medicine, her stomach feels a little lighter. And she's farted three times. The first time was at 9:40 last night. The second time was at one o'clock in the middle of the night. The third time was at dawn. Farting is a sign of qi flowing smoothly. So when I heard the fart, I felt relieved. Anyway, her illness is all caused by stagnation of liver qi. All said and done, it's our old lady's fault for having such a bad temper. She always likes to talk too much, regardless of whether her daughter-in-law is getting angry or not. So it's hard to avoid being troubled. There's also one annoying thing about our old lady. Every time she goes to sleep, she always coughs and spits phlegm. The sound of her wheezing and sighing never stops. She sleeps in the room next door, and it tires people out so much that they can't sleep soundly. How can someone who is sick sleep well? That's just fate.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said goodbye again and went inside. Sister-in-law Li sighed: Alas... The old lady pants, not as good as the young mistress farting. "Old pearls are worthless," what else is there to say.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Difficulty in Finding a Wife, Hesitation and Worry About the Future, Small Gathering of Friends, Shy Remembrance of the Past</p>
<p>Zhao Ziqiang laughed: Where did you get those few sentences? You made them all up. Yin Deren didn't argue with him, but patted his shoulder and laughed: Hurry up and prepare for the wedding. It'll be spring soon. Besides the condolence money (Note: When something happy or sad happens to someone in the same battalion, officers from the brigade commander down give money as congratulations or condolences, called collective charity. The amount ranges from a few cents to a few yuan), I have to give you a generous gift, haha! Zhao Ziqiang saw that he wouldn't say anything, so he had to walk downstairs. But on the opposite wall, he saw the slogan that their company had prepared for the inspection committee: "If the Xiongnu are not wiped out, how can we have a home?" Zhao Ziqiang thought, just looking at this, Yin Deren's aspirations are clear. Looking at the affairs of Guan and Yin, it really doesn't make sense for soldiers to get married. In this day and age, if the guns aren't pointed outwards, they'll be pointed inwards. How long can they be stationed in this place in Xiyuan? It's impossible for a company commander to take his family everywhere. He can only leave his wife at home. If a young wife is left at home, can she avoid any problems in this day and age? Zhao Ziqiang asked himself the difficult questions and thought about them himself, and his heart grew cold. He just stared blankly at the eight-character slogan on the wall. Someone called out Zhao Company Commander beside him. When he turned around, it was the company's quartermaster standing there. He asked: Your company is even more well-organized, and the slogans are written so neatly. Who wrote them? The quartermaster said: I wrote them. Actually, our Company Commander Yin himself thinks these eight characters are right. Zhao Ziqiang also understood what he meant and shrugged his shoulders with a slight smile. The quartermaster said: Zhao Company Commander, when will I get to drink a cup of your wedding wine? Zhao Ziqiang laughed: You even know about this matter. Fortunately, this isn't a bad thing. If it were a bad thing, I couldn't keep it a secret. He laughed and walked back to the company headquarters, thinking to himself, can this marriage be done or not? I really should consider it now.

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>The Salesgirl</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Zhu Xinong often saw many articles praising salesgirls in the tabloids, and she couldn't help but be extremely envious. One said how beautiful the Parker (nickname for salesgirls) of Chang Le Company was, another said how charming the stocking queen of Rong Guang Company was. Yet another said how delicate the bun beauty of Hua Qiang Company was, and how enchanting the silk head beauty of Ai Li Company was... All this made her feel very envious and at the same time very frustrated, because she had also looked at her own face in the clear mirror, carefully observed it, and found that it was well-grown and very full. Although it couldn't be said to be a round face replacing the moon, it could be said to be an apricot face full of spring. Just those two tender cheeks, she felt, had the chance to be broken with a puff of air; and those two captivating dimples were even more precious and worth a fortune. That small mouth that wasn't pouting or flat, just grew there, plus some dazzling lipstick, and any heterosexual friend who saw it would come and bow down to her pomegranate skirt... If my luck doesn't come, then I won't have such a good opportunity. If there was such an advertisement from major companies to recruit salesgirls, I would definitely win in the end... Such fragmented thoughts often lingered in her mind.</p>
<p>Our company now needs ten salesgirls to be assigned to various departments to serve. The remuneration is generous. If you are willing to come and serve, from × month × day to × month × day, from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, please come to the salesgirl registration office of Lili Company at 323 Huashi Road to contact us. Lili Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>This advertisement was published in the local news classified advertising column of Le Bao on × day. The wooden block characters: "Salesgirls Wanted" were arranged in front. What amazing news this was! Especially for our Zhu Xinong, she saw such a good message that fit her heart on that day, and of course she felt extremely happy.</p>
<p>This is an obvious fact: posting newspaper ads to recruit personnel attracts even more people than using candy to attract ants. This time, Lili Company also stated that it was from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, but at 9:00 AM, a middle-aged woman with long raindrop eyebrows and a thin figure came to apply. In the end, she left because the time had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>After they had lunch, they arranged three long tables in the style of three characters each in the salesgirl registration office, and put paper, ink, brushes and inkstones on them, waiting for the salesgirls to come for the exam. At that time, it was only 1:38 PM! Two girls of almost the same height, dressed in black clothes and white shoes, came in together. The staff managing the registration quickly stood up to greet them, asked them to sit down separately, and each fill out a registration form. However, the continuous arrival of applicants meant that the staff was not enough to manage them. Among the many people, of course there were beautiful ones and ugly ones. Among them was a pair of twin flowers, who said they had worked at Chang Le Company. One was wearing a long printed silk dress and had worked at the Sino-Foreign Pharmacy, one was wearing a long striped spun dress and had worked at the × District Office, and one was dressed as a student and had taught at ×× Middle School. There were quite a few who had done things and had experience, but there were also many who had not done anything. The funniest thing was an old one and a young one. The old one was probably more than forty years old, and the young one was only fourteen years old. The old man who accompanied her, who looked like her father, said: She is sixteen years old. Zhu Xinong also came to apply at that time. There were already many people writing at the registration office. The staff asked her to wait a moment. This was really something that made people feel very interested. Her spring-like face, which was both angry and happy, could simply overwhelm the group of beauties who came to apply. Their staff were all secretly discussing that this person would probably be selected. After a woman in a light blue and black floral dress had finished filling out the form, they quickly came to greet her and ask her to fill it out. Sure enough, she held the fountain pen she had brought and wrote very fluently, without stopping at all, which simply stunned the staff. One person next to her was the opposite of her, holding the pen but unable to write a single word. A week later, a small newspaper had a big headline: Lili Company's Queen Zhu Xinong... It seemed that there was no need to read any further.</p>

<h3>National Goods Enterprise and Safety Equipment</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Management Association invited Ms. E.M. Hinder, a factory management expert, to give a lecture the day before yesterday. Ms. Hinder pays close attention to factory safety issues. What she said are the problems most commonly encountered by domestic product factories, which are indeed matters of life and death for domestic product factories. Ms. Hinder raised the following issues:</p>
<p>First, after workers have started working, factories immediately close their entrance gates tightly, even sealing them with tape, prohibiting anyone from entering or exiting.</p>
<p>Second, many goods and miscellaneous items are piled up at factory entrances, causing many difficulties for people coming and going.</p>
<p>Third, buildings are too simple and crude, or in disrepair.</p>
<p>Fourth, dangerous goods that easily cause disasters are arbitrarily piled up.</p>
<p>Fifth, fire-fighting equipment is not fully equipped.</p>
<p>Most factories still fail to pay attention to improving these situations, resulting in repeated tragedies. The recent catastrophe at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory and others is particularly frightening to think about. Factory safety equipment is the most important and noteworthy issue during the year of national goods. Ms. Hinder is extremely enthusiastic about this matter. When she lectured the other day, most leaders of various domestic product factories attended, demonstrating a consensus on this issue. At the same time, various factories in Shanghai have also organized an Industrial Safety Association, specializing in the research and improvement of industrial safety equipment, and publishing an Industrial Safety Monthly, introducing European and American works on industrial safety issues. This is truly a good phenomenon during the year of national goods. Mr. Wu Yun-chu said: "China is an industrially backward country. Due to a shortage of capital, factories mostly invest all their funds in production equipment, without considering whether this equipment is safe, let alone special safety equipment." This is such a heartbreaking matter. Many factory leaders should not assume that because they have been running their factories for one or two decades without experiencing a disaster, injury, or death, that they can be satisfied. This is just luck, not proof that safety equipment has been given attention or is irrelevant. If they are perfunctory and continue as before, the sacrifices will be immeasurable in the event of an accident. Therefore, I hope that the authorities of each factory will pay close attention to this major issue with all their strength, and not be too stingy with expenses. Stinginess often leads to greater losses. They should not rely solely on ideals, as ideals are merely empty talk. We should not run factories unless we are prepared to do so. The first priority in running a factory is to work steadily and cautiously. By paying attention to this issue, there is hope for the national goods enterprise.</p>

<h3>An Analysis of the Contradictory Purchasing Power of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>— Sheng Bi</p>
<p>Today, I believe that everyone in the country knows that China is a country that has lost its sovereignty and suffered humiliation. However, the Chinese people, as if drunk, not only have failed to sober up and get rid of bad habits, but seem to be even more intoxicated. The entire Chinese nation is trapped in a deep pit of mistakes and contradictions.</p>
<p>Now, focusing solely on clothing, men and women seen on the market, especially young men and women, almost all have foreign goods on their bodies, some even wearing foreign goods from head to toe. Considering our national obligations and responsibilities, living in China today, with the countryside bankrupt and the market so desolate, and with civil wars erupting here and there, we are exporting our sweat and blood abroad! With the economy bankrupt to this point, is wearing foreign goods still considered glorious or respectable? Doesn't our country have strong and beautiful fabrics? To be more aristocratic, there are still silks and satins to wear, which have more glory than foreign goods that are merely superficial. To put it more clearly: "Wearing domestic goods is the only way to have true glory and true respect! Only then can you fulfill your national responsibilities and obligations!"</p>
<p>Regarding what I have said above, the Chinese people should use their clear minds to analyze it carefully and quickly abandon this vanity of leaking rights and interests abroad! I predict with certainty: "If we continue to be vain like this, in the near future, the entire Chinese nation will be vain to the point of extinction!" Domestic goods are equally exquisite, so why bother?</p>
<p>Speaking of household appliances, the situation is somewhat different from what was said above. This is in the small bourgeoisie's homes, in the living room, in the room, you can always see a little foreign utensils, of course, you are using your own money, however, you need to understand that this is not about paying attention to equipment, it is no different from using to hurt yourself! Even in terms of diet, the use of foreign goods is also considerable. If anyone could calculate the daily expenses, the amount would surely be shocking!</p>
<p>In short, we have our purely practical domestic goods. In terms of purchasing power, we should try our best to buy domestic goods so that Chinese money can be used and reused within our own country, and not be earned by the two-faced, blue-eyed foreigners and sent abroad! Let them laugh at us, holding up blue grape wine and singing songs of victory.</p>
<h3>National Goods and Salesmen</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met a manager of a famous domestic product factory. He said: Promoting domestic goods is certainly a very important task at present, but the vanguard of promoting domestic goods is the salesmen of the issuing house. If the salesmen are effective, there will be more customers and goods will sell well. If the salesmen are ineffective, no matter how good your products are or how low the prices are, general customers will still look away and ignore you. He said that in the store, I stipulate that salesmen must have the following six minimum standard habits:</p>
<p>(1) Smiling (2) Nodding in greeting (3) Having an equal perspective (4) Speaking softly and slowly (5) Saying "Goodbye, goodbye" (6) Saying "Take care, take care" Finally, he said that after these six points, I added a sentence, "What about non-salesmen? What about the non-salesman scope?" These words are really well said. Don't think it's old news, the economy of doing business is all in there.</p>
<h3>Announcement of This Journal</h3>

<h3>Promotion of National Goods and Restoration of Rural Purchasing Power</h3>
<p>— Yi Hong</p>
<p>The Northeast has been lost for two years now. The lost land has not been recovered, how can we call ourselves a nation? Ordinary patriotic compatriots, although witnessing the depth of the national crisis and feeling the tension of the moment, have the will to love the country but lack the means to defend it. Resistance against Japan is the only way for the nation to save itself, and the production industry is where the lifeblood of the country lies. Therefore, developing industry and enriching national strength are even more important tasks. The national goods industry is at a time of survival and extinction, economic panic, and the national capital is like floating in the wind and rain. The southeast corner still has a vigorous and positive image. It is what we must regard as comforting after disappointment.</p>
<p>(1) The Seriousness of Rural Bankruptcy 丨 Since imperialism ravaged its ideal market with its surplus production, rural handicrafts have been completely destroyed. The self-sufficient economic organization has been fundamentally shaken, and the national industry has been unable to develop due to heavy pressure. The old economic organization has been destroyed, and the new foundation has not yet been established. In this major transition between the old and the new, the various phenomena caused by rural bankruptcy are naturally inevitable stages in the process. Therefore, in addition to striving to establish a national industry and develop national capital, we have no other way to achieve self-reliance. However, there is one prerequisite, which is how to get rid of the shackles of imperialism and the oppression of feudal forces. (2) The Greatest Efforts of the National Goods Industry 丨 Promoting national goods is the main factor in developing national goods, and the greatest need is also the important target of promoting national goods. Farmers in our country account for 79% of the total population. What farmers need is the same as what the whole country needs. Since we recognize that the main consumers of national goods production are farmers, the direction of our efforts is naturally the countryside rather than the city. However, in recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, disasters have been frequent, and last autumn there was a "cheap grain hurt farmers" situation again. Ordinary farmers were already exhausted and unable to survive. The so-called purchasing power has plummeted to the lowest limit. It is not easy for us to promote national goods into the countryside and use them to prosper. Speculators only care about current interests and manufacture luxury goods one after another in order to cater to the tastes of urban society. This kind of deformed development is more harmful than beneficial to the future of the national industry. Although, we should not be sad about the harsh environment, and we should not be disappointed by the obstacles to progress. We must explore the root of the problem. Dare to ask if this road is absolutely impassable?</p>
<p>(3) How to Promote Rural Purchasing Power 丨 Rural purchasing power is so weak, but in fact, foreign goods are everywhere in the inland villages. It can be seen that the minimum necessities of farmers' lives are indispensable. Even if they are heavily in debt, they still try their best to handle it. How can they endure the destruction of capitalism after such exhaustion and exhaustion? Therefore, although purchasing power in inland villages is weak, the need cannot be reduced at any time. If the national goods industry can replace them, the prosperity of national goods can be expected and the outflow of profits can be avoided. What we should pay close attention to now is how to recover the rural market. Based on my humble opinions, I will list the following:</p>
<p>(A) Improvement of the quality of national goods and reduction of costs 丨 The goods required by farmers must have three conditions: cheap, good quality, and durable 丨 When the three are available, there will be great help in promoting the promotion.</p>
<p>(B) Investigation of foreign goods sales and manufacture of national goods substitutes 丨 Start with rural areas with convenient transportation, and investigate in detail their sales volume and distribution, and compile statistics for reference in the manufacture of national goods. The most popular ones should be imitated and manufactured as much as possible, and the government should be requested to exempt them from taxes, and strive to publicize them in order to drive foreign goods out of the market. After the advent of national goods such as tobacco, MSG, soap, and enamel products, the enemy goods disappeared invisibly, which is also the most remarkable achievement in the past.</p>
<p>(C) Establishment of the National Goods Production Chain Association 丨 Farmers have shallow knowledge and do not know how to choose when shopping, and are easily deceived by hypocrites. We should guide the organization of consumer cooperatives and jointly organize production and marketing associations with national goods factories and companies in urban areas, so that when farmers purchase, the goods are genuine and the prices are fair, and they know what to do, and avoid the exploitation of merchants.</p>
<p>(D) Deepening National Goods Exhibitions 丨 Poor rural areas are limited by their knowledge. National goods factories should contact and organize mobile exhibition groups, and conduct mobile exhibitions in rural villages to introduce them to farmers as much as possible, so that they have a considerable understanding of national goods and improve their faith.</p>
<p>The above four points are just the big ones. Finally, we should understand that this kind of policy to improve purchasing power is passive rather than active, and it is a symptomatic treatment rather than a cure. The real improvement of purchasing power can only be sound and lasting after the entire agricultural economic problem is solved. In addition to making considerable efforts for this kind of passive policy at present, we must also make long-term struggles to fundamentally get rid of the shackles of imperialism and build a stable national industry.</p>
<h3>National Goods News</h3>
<p>Xihu Towel Sanyou Industrial Company recently launched a new kind of Xihu towel, which is light, soft, clean and elegant, and can be regarded as a new contribution to the national goods towel year. It is also heard that the company does not hesitate to sacrifice in order to introduce new products to people from all walks of life for trial use, and will attach a towel to those who purchase goods from the company for more than two yuan of national currency, as a token of appreciation and for trial use. The fourth national exhibition in this city. The fourth national goods movement exhibition in this city will be held in Penglai Market on the Double Ninth Festival as decided by the citizens' promotion of national goods conference. It is heard that various national goods factories have been enthusiastically reporting to participate in the exhibition in recent days. As of yesterday (27th), there are more than 80 companies. It is also heard that a lantern festival will be held on the same day, with flags and festoons hanging, and lights all over the sky. It is expected that there will be a grand scene at that time.</p>
<p>After the business development of the two major national goods companies, a "small national goods market" has recently been discovered. Its address is in Jinli at the end of Erma Road. Although the scale is very small and the goods are not many, its purpose is to promote national goods and develop the market. Compared with several large department stores that rely solely on selling foreign goods for profit, it is naturally much better.</p>
<p>Levying anti-dumping duties and the National Production Conference This is a new facility related to the government on the future of national goods. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry deeply regret the dumping of foreign goods and the decline of national goods. According to the regulations of the anti-dumping goods tax law promulgated by the National Government in September 1931, anti-dumping duties will be levied on the top ten foreign goods that are most severely dumped (it is now heard that ten kinds of planted yarn silk tea cloth rice wheat timber fish light bulbs matches are temporarily set). Anti-dumping duties are levied in order to develop national goods. The "National Production Conference" convened and held by the Ministry of Industry will also be opened recently, bringing together national goods giants from all over the country to jointly discuss, improve technology, increase production, unite as one, and form a national production network, seeking welfare for the future of national goods.</p>
<p>Short news In the autumn season, epidemics are rampant. If you are not clean, you are at risk of getting sick. If you always spray stinky water on dirty places, germs will disappear. Among the domestic stinky water, the double-knife brand has the best sales. It is heard that the Nanyang Islands and northern ports have been purchasing from Xinyuan Line in batches these days, and there must be several cases every day.</p>

<h3>Rare Books of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries</h3>
<p>— Rong Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Now, in addition to wars and political disputes, there is also a dispute over the phototype printing of "rare books" in the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" that few idlers would pay attention to. Officials and merchants want to print it in the original style as soon as possible, but the academic community believes that the library version has deletions and errors. If other versions are available, other "good versions" should be used instead.</p>
<p>However, the academic community's proposal will not pass, and the result will always be to follow the "Imperial Edition of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries." The reason is very clear, just because they want to hurry. The disappearance of the four provinces and the sale of the nine birds are nothing to talk about. Just the Huanghe River's out-of-control actions make people feel that it is difficult to end the day. If you want to do business, you have to hurry. Moreover, the words "Imperial Edition" still have a bit of prestige. "Imperial Physician" and "Tribute Satin" have different meanings from others. Even France, which has long been a republic, Napoleon's collection of books is still more valuable than the collections of commoners at auction. The famous European "China scholars" will cite the "Imperial Edition of the Complete Library Integration" when talking about China. This is something that Chinese textual researchers are unwilling to play with, but it can also be seen that the "rare books" that have been printed with the "Imperial Edition" can always be better business than "good versions" abroad.</p>
<p>Even in China, I am afraid that the "rare books" are still better business. Because this can be used as decoration. And the "good version" can only be practical. Those who can buy such books are definitely not poor scholars who can afford it, so it is also conceivable that they will definitely be offered in the living room after they buy them. This kind of buyer will buy an ancient tripod from the Shang and Zhou dynasties and put it up. If necessary, they may buy a fake ancient tripod and put it up, but they will never buy a casserole or iron pot and put it on a rosewood table. Because his purpose is in "rare" and not in "good", and even less in whether it can be practical.</p>
<p>People in the late Ming Dynasty liked fame, and engraving ancient books was also a trend. However, they often did not understand it themselves. They thought it was a typo, so they changed it randomly. It would be okay not to change it, but once it was changed, it would be changed wrong, so that later textual researchers sighed and said that the Ming people liked to engrave ancient books, but the ancient books were lost. This time, the "rare books" in the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" are phototype printed, and there is absolutely no malpractice of changing mistakes. However, the original version has unintentional typos and deliberate deletions and changes, and because of the spread of the new version, it can make the good version sink down. If serious readers occasionally get such a copy in the future, I am afraid they will always have to sigh for the second time.</p>
<p>However, the result will always be to follow the "Imperial Edition of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries." Because the affairs of "the future" are not related to the current officials and merchants.</p>
<h3>Suzhou People and Lullabies</h3>
<p>— You Sheng</p>
<p>At dusk, on Guanqian Street in Suzhou, you can often see a crowd of heads under the electric lights, staring blankly at the door plaques of the big merchants. A soft voice is released on the door plaque, like rice soup: "Uuuuuu········· 丨丨" This is the radio broadcasting Chen Yumei's lullaby. The crowd of heads is glued together by the sound waves, neither shaking nor making a sound. Their eyes are open, but they all seem to be asleep.</p>
<p>Chen Yumei's lullaby was transmitted to Suzhou, originally relying on "a polished black circle, with a dog drawn in front of a loudspeaker."</p>
<p>This time, every household is learning to sing it. The Wu people, who are good at soft words, have a special talent for the integration of this song's tune. Although the young masters also hum, they still find it comfortable to listen to and bite on melon seeds.</p>
<p>In this silent China, the lullaby can be regarded as the voice of Suzhou people. Because the two have absolute harmony in any aspect.</p>
<p>In life, let's look at the collection place that represents the important life of Suzhou people丨丨teahouse, the scene inside is the most serious. Tea guests surround the square table from morning to night, from morning to night. Neurologically speaking, Suzhou people do not go home all year round, hiding in the teahouse, Dragon Well tea, Sparrow Tongue tea, savoring it endlessly. It seems that their souls are wandering in the bottom of the cup and their bodies are in the pot. Although there is a noisy sound rolling, it is equal to snoring and talking in sleep. There is no lullaby singing here, but it contains a strong lullaby atmosphere. This air floats freely, filling the entire city of Suzhou.</p>
<p>In this "cradle" of Suzhou, there are sleeping Cheng Jian Aliutou; there is also our General Su Bingwen sleeping. (The general is now lying in ambush in Su)</p>
<p>Suzhou is originally the most suitable and should be a place to sleep. Even without listening to lullabies.</p>
<p>When my fellow villagers say that someone is sleeping, they do not say the word "sleeping": "Going to Suzhou"丨Because Suzhou is the place where straw mats are produced. Since there is a historical tradition, it is no wonder that the rich and important people now say that Suzhou is a very quiet place; isn't it best to sleep in quiet? What's wrong with changing the city of Suzhou to "Sleepy City"?</p>
<p>Moreover, the lullabies sung by the women of Suzhou are very pleasant!</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang expressed his opinion a few days ago: "Let the women do it for a while!" He himself plans to step down and go abroad, and not hear about foreign affairs. (The Analects are still to be compiled, right?) This proposal is very purposeful for all men. Although Mr. Yu Ming explained that "women are also not good" and quoted the saying "Those who care for their health are not enough to handle major events" to criticize Mr. Yutang for only knowing how to read the Analects but not knowing how to read Mencius. However, Mr. Yu Ming did not think deeply about it······ If all the women sing in unison: "Don't quarrel, don't make noise, baby, take a nap, oh丨丨丨" Naturally, they will fall asleep, and even the women themselves will have a good sleep, and a major event in life will be completed. Then listen: "Asleep, awake, get up and eat a piece of cake······" Cake, no matter what kind of cake, is always better than tree bark and grass roots, right? 200 million people just "urge," and 200 million people just "sleep." As a result, everyone is sleeping. If you want the world to be uneasy, how can you get it? Therefore, I say: To govern the world with sleep, success can be achieved immediately.</p>
<p>By the way, if there are women in the country who do not understand how to sing lullabies, they can ask the people of Suzhou; men who are hypnotized but do not sleep can also ask the people of Suzhou. Suzhou people, in China, that is, in the world, they are all thoroughly proficient in hypnosis and sleep, and they are also very polite to hope for them.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Wind</h3>
<p>— Sun Yang</p>
<p>Because the house I live in is already old and cannot stand firmly, I felt uneasy when I read in the newspaper a few days ago that there would be strong winds coming to Shanghai. I worried all night, but fortunately the wind did not come.</p>
<p>But my "wind" is open, and in the past, Song Yu and Jing Cha accompanied King Xiang of Chu to visit the Lantai Palace. A wind blew suddenly, and King Xiang was very happy and said: "How pleasant! Is this wind shared by me and the common people?" Song Yu hurriedly replied: "This is only the wind of the great king!" Then he showed his "helping idleness" talent and described the wind of the great king: At first, this wind started from the foot of Mount Tai: "Fluttering and surging, exciting and angry; overturning stones and cutting down trees, killing the forest and running." First, it started out with great power outside the imperial city, and then "riding over the high city and entering the deep palace." After circling a few times, only the tail of the wind was left, blowing on King Xiang's belly, of course, it was happy.</p>
<p>Song Yu's flattery was very appropriate. Jing Cha could only be dry and embarrassed. Qu Yuan hid at the bottom of the Miluo River, probably regretting that he was too honest and not as good as a disciple. Thousands of years later, Li Houzhu was ignorant and "busy himself," and suffered disaster with "the small building was blown by the east wind again last night." Compared with Song Yu, Yu really deserves to be the master of describing the wind! Since there is the wind of the great king, there must be the wind of the common people. Song Yu said that this wind originated in the poor alley, "moving sand and dust, blowing dead ashes, alarming the dirty water, and raising rotten waste." Blowing into the nostrils, it must be uncomfortable. Compared with the wind of the great king "wandering among cinnamon and pepper," it is no wonder that King Xiang was complacent. However, Song Yu did not pay attention to the fact that when the wind of the great king was showing its power outside the city, the common people had already suffered enough. Thanks to King Xiang being confused丨丨or even pretending to be confused丨丨otherwise Song Yu would be in trouble.</p>
<p>Pretending to be confused is appropriate, and flattery is popular, but I feel that the wind of the great king has a bit of the "push" flavor of the "third kind of people." This is just like the wind that had not yet blown to the Bund buildings a few days ago, stirring up a big fire in the grassy mud pond of Laobaidu in Pudong, burning down the thatched sheds of two thousand poor people.</p>
<p>I also thought that if the big storm that bypassed Shanghai really came, what kind of wind could it be? In vulgar terms, it is a tornado, and in elegant terms, according to the writing style of "helping idleness" literati, it can only be regarded as the wind of the committee chairman. Fortunately, this wind only circled in the southern part of the East China Sea and went straight to Korea without going to Japan.</p>
<p>So I was doubly relieved!</p>
<h3>Autumnal Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>It is autumn once more.</p>
<p>The wind blows in from outside the window, adding to the coolness I feel.</p>
<p>I can't help but recall past events:</p>
<p>It was also such an autumn when I accompanied my weeping wife, carrying the coffin of our eight-month-old child, together to the International Cemetery.</p>
<p>The child had died of acute cholera.</p>
<p>Watching helplessly as three or four coolies buried the child's coffin, every subtle sound struck deeply into my heart. My heart ached intensely. Tears fell to the ground like coins, mingling with my wife's tears.</p>
<p>The child's voice and smiling face had vanished forever. I thought of the past eight months, as if I had lived a beautiful dream. Now, the dream was over, and all that remained for me was pain and sorrow, nothing else.</p>
<p>Silently, I placed a wreath on the child's grave, with these words attached to it: "May your innocent soul rest peacefully in heaven!"</p>
<p>On the way back, my heart was cold, as cold as the autumn wind.</p>
<p>Today, I feel this same cold wind again, and it suddenly reminds me: it is the child's first death anniversary.</p>
<p>I put down the work in my hands and ran out to buy a wreath, taking a car to the International Cemetery.</p>
<p>Standing before the child's grave, I felt lost. I thought about the events of the past year.</p>
<p>This is truly a time of drastic change. I have never seen the wheels of time turn so quickly. Under these wheels, the countryside is collapsing rapidly, our rivers and mountains continue to be shattered, the Yellow River is overflowing its banks, the people, on the verge of death, are crying out, and the fallen class is dancing madly on skulls. As for me, squeezed into the middle class, I am fortunate enough to still be alive. This is truly lucky.</p>
<p>But the child is also fortunate: he did not die in a dark corner, buried in a dark corner, unseen, unremembered, and he can receive the wreath I offer him.</p>
<p>Silently, I placed a wreath on the child's grave, sincerely praying:</p>
<p>"May your innocent soul rest peacefully in heaven!"</p>
<h3>Woman (7)</h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>She didn't need to understand these things. After moving into a famous seaside hotel, she spent her days quietly lying under a white parasol on the beach, gazing at the bright blue of the sea and sky. She was using the scenery of Beihai to wash away the unpleasant impressions of the South China Sea that lingered in her mind. She was resting. She was waiting.</p>
<p>Sometimes she hired a white horse and rode around the mountains, or along the sandy beaches, deserted by bathers, where the tide had receded. At other times, she would sit alone in a small boat, slowly rowing with small oars, taking the boat three or five li out to sea, letting it drift and sway on the salty water.</p>
<p>The unfamiliar place and unfamiliar people did not make her feel lonely. In this quiet and undisturbed solitude, she had a companion: her own heart.</p>
<p>When she lay on the sand, she seemed to understand nature and her own nature a little better. She seemed to see everything, hear everything, and analyze everything with greater clarity than before.</p>
<p>What particularly pleased her was that, in this place, among the tourists, no one seemed to know who she was. Although there seemed to be several pairs of unfamiliar eyes that might accidentally meet hers on the beach each day, and she even suspected that these eyes often watched her from afar and from hidden places, there was no trouble. Even if a woman is tired of men, she often, in her consciousness, remembers the impression of men acting foolishly because of her beauty. As a kind of secret pleasure… of course we cannot like a person who loves wine, but a drunkard in a writer's work does not make us frown. In this world, there are also several kinds of human postures of those who are captivated by beauty, which are smiling when they are presented!</p>
<p>Rowing was a sport that she was good at, and the surface of ×× Sea was especially suitable for light boats to float on in the morning and evening. One day, she drove that white boat alone, paddling with oars, and sailed east along the coast.</p>
<p>The east is the place where the sun rises, and there should also be things as bright and passionate as the sun waiting there. But what was she waiting for?</p>
<p>In the east, apart from two pyramid-shaped islands ten miles away, there was only a sea plated with silver by the sunlight. The sea was silver in the morning and blue in the afternoon, emitting the brilliance of blue sapphires. The vast sea filled one with boundless fantasies.</p>
<p>A little further east, there were two more bays, also with sandy beaches, suitable for sea bathing, but with very few visitors.</p>
<p>She slowly rowed the boat, thinking until she reached the third bay. She liked to look at the scenery on the coast from the boat. She liked playing so lonely, because she was tired of being lively.</p>

<h3>Financial Rumors Fuel Selling, Standard Gold Continues to Fall by Thirteen Yuan One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued to decline, and the people were unusually panicked. In the early morning, due to the long positions in the British and American silver markets and the rise in British and American exchange rates by 0.75, and the rise in the American-British exchange rate by 0.05, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 6.5 li, American cotton rose slightly, and American wheat shrank by just over 3 fen. Stocks fluctuated both up and down. The raw market opened flat, and the rise in silver prices was not strong. People's hearts were initially quite stable. After opening, due to the loose exchange rate and downstream pressure, HSBC's listing first rose by 1.125 shillings and US dollars rose by 0.375, barely able to struggle. Unexpectedly, the selling households were extremely brave, and people's hearts turned timid. Rumors that 嗬　abandoned the gold standard actually made buyers helpless. It was really because the domestic market was weakening. In the end, it broke through to within 30 yuan. Although there were Guang Gang and Dalian Gang trying to buy, their numbers were too few to fight the crowd. It was found that the market situation was bleak for half a day. Although Reuters telegraphed before the raw market that the US President allowed the newly cast US dollars to be transported for export through the Federal Reserve Bank, and that the public could withdraw cash for circulation, the number was limited to below 100 yuan, and the time was limited to within 30 days, it stabilized slightly, but it was difficult to maintain for a long time. The clam price was still increased by 230. Now, the market situation for half a day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 839 yuan, an increase of 0.2 jiao compared to the previous close. The opening price of goods was 8 yuan and 3 jiao. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of 1 shilling and 3 pence for British exchange, and 28.375 yuan for US exchange. Bingxing Yifeng Yongheng and others all sold. The November US dollar was difficult to sell at 0.75. The market immediately fell. Zhengjin then sealed the same month at 29 yuan, and fell to 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengyu Tongyi Yongfeng Daxing Yonglian took the initiative to make entries. HSBC and Huabi also stripped the November 29 yuan. HSBC's listing revealed an increase of 1.125 shillings and 0.375 US dollars. At this time, it had recovered to around 7 yuan, because Zhengjin ate the December US dollar at 1.125, and the bank needed the November 9.375. Soon, rumors rose again. Huabi came out with the November US dollar at</p>
<p>9.375, and retreated to within 5 yuan. Hengxing Shengda bought vigorously up to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. Dadecheng Fuyu still sold. The situation was frustrated again. Dongya came out with the November US dollar at 9.375, down to 4 yuan. North Korea and others paid the same month at 29 yuan, and it once rose to over 6 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market was full of panic and people's hearts were extremely timid. Hengyu Fuyu Richang Yuanmao sold to 0.5 jiao. No one needed to settle the October 29 yuan. Soon, Hengtai Yuanheng Hengyu Yuanfeng Yong and others vigorously dumped, and the October US dollar at 29 yuan was also difficult to sell, and fell to 28.6 jiao. Hengxingsheng bought vigorously without stopping, and once rebounded to 30 yuan and 8 jiao. Yuansheng Yongzhifeng Yongheng Yu Yuanmao Yong Dadecheng repeatedly dumped. Maijiali Huabi sealed the December US dollar at 0.375, and plummeted to 25.5 yuan. Shenkang Laijin Pan Genna bought the December US dollar at 4.375, rising to 8 yuan, but with Yifeng Yong Dadecheng supplying to the market, the afternoon closing still retreated to 825 yuan and 7 jiao, and goods were sold at 6 yuan. It was found that the highest price in the half day was 839, and the lowest was 825 yuan and 5 jiao, with a difference of 13.5 yuan. The result was a decrease of</p>
<p>Thirteen yuan and one jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The listed price was 28.125 yuan due to HSBC Bank's listing of US exchange rising by 0.375, equivalent to a standard gold price of over 853 yuan. According to the closing price, about 27 yuan was pressed, more than 1 yuan stronger than the previous close. The account for this month was 837 yuan, September was 832 yuan, and October was 826 yuan. In the morning, Yong was supplemented at 837 yuan. The clam price was still increased by 230 yuan. Transactions in the market were increased from 240 yuan to 252 yuan. Tianjin Gang sold goods from 248 yuan to 252 yuan, which was eaten by colleagues, because the futures standard was gradually falling. 763 entries were still left this month, and 2,100 entries were left in September.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were quite active. In summary, Hengxingshengda Shenkang Wanxingshunlikang Tongyi and others were on the buying side, and Hengtai Neixing Hengyu Yifeng Yong Yuansheng Yongzhifeng Yong Dadecheng Fuyu Yuanmao Yong and others were on the selling side. Dalian Gang Wanxing entered over 1,000 and exited over 800. Shunli entered 994 entries and exited over 700. Guang Gang entered over 1,300 entries and exited a small number.

It started to rise suddenly by two points yesterday, with a new price of eight points. Although the rise and fall were minimal, in terms of sentiment, there seemed to be a dawn of new prospects. The market atmosphere was not without some comfort.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>August Futures Bond Delivery Proceeds Very Smoothly</h3>
<p>A total of 31,235,000 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (August 30th) was the delivery date for August futures at the Chinese Securities Exchange. Because it was summer, the number of trading sessions was reduced, and the market was closed every afternoon. From the 21st, it was changed to three sessions. In addition, the situation in this month was calm, without any major changes, so the trading was also greatly reduced. However, the amount of delivery was not less than before, and the process was quite smooth. It was found that the total amount of delivery was 31,235,000 yuan, of which 15,955,000 yuan was settled and delivered by the brokers themselves through mutual account transfers. The amount of delivery in the exchange was 15,280,000 yuan. However, although the amount of off-exchange delivery by the brokers was impossible to verify, it should also be several million yuan. The largest amount of delivery was still from No. 46 in the financial sector, with approximately 6-7 million delivered. A certain bank received approximately 5-6 million in goods, and the remaining entry and exit quantities were approximately 1 million or so, with the smallest amount being only over 100,000. The northern gang also delivered, and the number of arbitrage was also considerable. The market price was very stable, with fluctuations mostly within one yuan, and the smallest being only 5 fen or 1 jiao. The flatter the market price, the less the transaction. It was found that on August 18th, the entire day's trading was only 2,920,000, which shows how quiet the market was. Tracing back to June 30th, the initial market price of the August futures was 63 yuan and 4 jiao for disarmament. The smallest price in the middle was 62 yuan and 9 jiao on July 4th, and the highest was 68 yuan on July 19th. Although the difference between the highest and lowest was 5 yuan and 1 jiao, when calculated in August, the highest was 67 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest was 65 yuan and 1 jiao, with a difference of only 2 yuan and 1 jiao. The difference between the highest and lowest salt tax was 5 yuan and 2 jiao, which was only 2 yuan and 5 jiao when calculated in this month. There were 58 days in between, and the most memorable was only July 19th, because the US-China loan was established on July 5th, and the market was filled with shorts, and the rising trend was extremely large, until July 19th. After August, the bond market was dull and lifeless. On August 1st, Chief Chiang's telegram to Chahe was peaceful, and on August 7th, Feng's telegram withdrew from Cha Province. The situation came to an end. Although rumors were spread that Doolan had fallen again, Japan had demanded old debts, or that the government would issue new bonds, they were all nothing but baseless rumors. Therefore, the market price in this month was generally in a state of steady consolidation. Moreover, before and after delivery, it was as usual, with no signs of squeezing shorts or longs. Therefore, August had almost no special circumstances to speak of. Only 961 kind suddenly rumored reorganization on August 23, and saw some fluctuations, but it was only a flash in the pan. The future may wait for Finance Minister Song to announce his new contributions after returning home before there will be a larger wave. It is estimated that the total turnover of various bonds in August was 21,727 million.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported on Tuesday (29th) that the New York stock market was initially firm, but gradually fell about an hour later, and several stocks fell by about 7 yuan. However, President Lutherford ordered the newly minted gold to be released for export, and the situation turned sharply before the close. The shorts rushed to cover their positions, and the gold mining stocks rose the most, followed by the railway stocks. The rest of the stocks also generally recovered to highs, resulting in a mixed picture. The total turnover for the day was 3.12 million shares. Wheat fell due to the weakening of the stock market and profit-taking by the longs. Cotton initially fell due to the weakening of stocks, grains, and British exchange, and profit-taking by the longs, but recovered due to the government's release of new gold exports. It is expected that the trend will continue to be firm tomorrow. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing price compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Thirty industrial stocks 103.59 down 1.25</p>
<p>Twenty railway stocks 35.81 up 0.21</p>
<p>Twenty public utility stocks 31.11 up 0.06</p>
<p>Forty bonds 87.57 up 0.05</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales are Sluggish, New Cotton is Gradually Arriving</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation is sluggish. Because the overseas cotton market is still lower, and the gold market is falling, people's sentiment is depressed. However, there is talk that the yarn of a certain country has risen by 7-8 yuan, but the yarn market has been falling for a long time, and there may be a consolidation. However, most people are psychologically bearish. The futures market is closed due to the delivery at the end of the month. Spot yarn was bought by various gangs totaling 325 packages, and the market was flat. The purchase amounts of various gangs are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 155 Guangdong 35 Ningbo 5</p>
<p>Mainland 80 Anqing 10 Colleagues 40</p>
<p>The cotton market is still sluggish, because the weather is good and the harvest is abundant. New cotton from various sources is gradually being listed enthusiastically, and the selling price is cheap. The factory is still not absorbing it as much as possible, because the yarn market is not good. The opening price of new cotton from Yongzhou is 38 yuan per dan. 480 packages of Ningbo Yao cotton arrived in Shanghai, with an opening price down 1 yuan from the previous day. However, dozens of packages were bought by the customer gang, and the rest have not yet been sold.</p>
<h3>A Review of the August Standard Yarn and Cotton and its Delivery</h3>
<p>Cotton 3,300 packages, yarn 37,500 dans</p>
<p>August Standard Yarn was listed on March 1st, with a price of 143 taels and 7 qian (equivalent to approximately 200.09 yuan in foreign currency). Later, due to disappointing spring sales, rural bankruptcy, and the cut-off of yarn sales, manufacturers gradually fell into difficulties, and the price gradually fell to 188 yuan. At that time, Shanghai had approximately 180,000-190,000 packages of yarn in stock. The severity of the situation was unprecedented. In mid-April, the factory proposed to reduce labor to maintain the factory's survival, which slightly stimulated the market and raised it to over 200 yuan. However, yarn sales were still not active, and the purchase power of various gangs was very weak. Moreover, inferior yarn was dumped heavily in all directions, and Chinese yarn was encroached upon. There were as many as 36,000 packages of chips stockpiled in the yarn and cloth warehouse. General speculators saw the unfavorable environment and sold at every rise, and the market trended further down. Extending to the middle of this month, with new cotton benefiting from favorable weather and excellent production, the market price fell, making it even more difficult for the long-tired and weak yarn market to maintain. The 80 yuan mark was broken, and the lowest price was once seen at 177 yuan. As a result, 3,300 packages were left, and the delivery price was 180 yuan.

<p>August Standard Cotton was listed on March 1st, with a price of 32 taels and 2 qian, equivalent to over 45 yuan in foreign currency. At this time, because American cotton was flat, Indian cotton was falling, and the yarn market was sluggish, the market trended downward. Moreover, the factories were in difficult operations, and the talk of stopping night work was very prevalent. The lowest price was once seen at 41 yuan and 4 jiao. Because the new president took office in the United States and implemented an expansionary monetary policy, American cotton rose straight from over 6 fen to over 1 jiao, arousing speculative activity and purchases. The market gradually rose. Later, in mid-June, Britain and Japan competed fiercely for the cotton industry issue. Britain boycotted Japanese goods and increased tariffs. Japanese merchants boycotted British goods as a retaliatory measure, and did not buy Indian cotton, but instead bought Chinese cotton. Later, the voice of squeezing shorts was loud. The highest price was once seen at 49 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the tree grew, it attracted the wind. The news that National Government Finance Minister Song Ziwen had borrowed 50 million yuan in cotton and wheat loans from the United States shook the people. The buyers were even more thunderstruck, and the market fell by over 1 yuan. The lowest price returned to 45 yuan and 4 jiao. However, the bulls' ambitions were not dead, and the lower the price, the stronger the idea of squeezing shorts became. However, the overseas cotton market was flat, and the weather was good, and a bumper harvest of new cotton was expected. However, the situation became one of riding a tiger, and it was difficult to let go, and the market was squeezed against the trend. The highest price was once seen at 49 yuan and 8 jiao. Inland factories and factories in Shanghai delivered the remaining 45,100 dans of cotton, and 37,500 dans were actually delivered. The goods included Shaanxi Huoji Yao cotton Tongzhou Ling, etc. The cotton was all received by bull companies, and the delivery price was 49 yuan. The list of receiving and delivering parties is listed below:</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Varied</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market first weakened due to the fatigue of Wall Street and reactionary selling, but the trend slightly firmed up by the close. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices showed mixed ups and downs, ranging from a rise or fall of one pound to four pounds. The Liverpool cotton market saw a spot price increase of two points and a futures price increase of one to two points. The Egyptian cotton spot price rose by two points. The Bombay cotton market firmed up due to purchases by a small number of retail investors and speculators. As a result, Pinga'er rose by 1 rupee 2.5 jiao, Tianmula rose by 1 rupee 1.5 jiao, and Bailuoxi rose by 1 rupee 1.75 jiao. The original telegram is recorded to the left. (Dated 29th)</p>

<h3>Flour Speculation Rampant</h3>
<p>丨This month, horizontal jump of two-thirds of a cent丨</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the opening of the flour market, the prices of each month showed a sign of initial softness followed by a rise. Due to the price of foreign wheat continuing to fall by $1.12 in Chicago and about 34 cents in Canada, the sentiment was not good at the initial opening. However, because this month was the last day, the general short positions were frantically covering, and the factories were also recovering their chips. Therefore, amidst the cheap spot prices, a squeeze was formed. Hence, this month rose steadily. Distant months were also slightly pulled up. By the afternoon opening, the squeeze on this month was still severe. It was rumored that some end-user accounts declared to the factories that they would buy, and the goods had been shipped out, but the standard had not yet been covered, so they had to rush in at the end. Therefore, the highest squeeze at the fourth session reached $2.28, but because the market price for August and September had leveled, hedging returned, and factories dumped about 200,000 bags, the situation became peaceful. It was found that this month's squeeze was not due to a shortage of goods, but entirely caused by short positions. As a result, this month rose horizontally by two-thirds of a cent compared to the previous day, September rose by 1.7 cents, October and November rose by 2.5 cents, December remained unchanged, and January rose by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Follows and Rises Five to Six Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the noon opening of the wheat futures market, the prices of each month showed a sign of initial flatness followed by a rise. Due to the decline in foreign wheat quotations, the opening price in September saw a small correction. Afterwards, each session rose because the flour market turned higher and because of Mr. Cai Song's return to China and the fact that the wheat had not yet been purchased, which caused concern. Therefore, each month showed a positive trend. By the afternoon opening, the market sentiment for each month had become peaceful, with little change compared to the morning. However, there are still abundant inventories of flour and wheat, so there are still problems in the future. As a result, September rose by six cents compared to the previous day, October rose by five cents, November rose by five cents, December rose by six cents, and January rose by four cents. Spot wheat is still active, but the quality of the goods varies, and the prices also fluctuate greatly. Qintong wheat opened at $3.79, Wuhe wheat at $3.89, and Yaowan wheat at $3.85, down to $3.75. Yangzhou wheat opened at $3.57, down to $3.20. Zhenjiang wheat opened at $3.38, and Gaoyou wheat opened at $3.67, down to $3.55, totaling 7,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hexia New Indica Rice Falls Two Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources were more than 30. The appetite of the stores on this street was acceptable, but the appetite of the wholesalers was sluggish, and the situation was mediocre. The market was weak, but the sellers tightened up. Therefore, the prices of Changbang Su, Tongbang Nangang and other japonica rice, as well as Du Yangjian, Qingjiao Song, Si Fengjing Bo rice, were stable. Bian Yin Yuan was flat and weak. Hexia new japonica rice was discounted by two jiao due to the sunny weather. The Dongxin factory still opened at $7.20.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from Hexia were 26 or 27. The appetite for various types of rice on the market was dull. The market situation for white rice was similar to before. Early rice, new and old, Kexian, Du Yangjian, Dongxin japonica rice, etc., did not fluctuate much. The price of new Yangjian rice was slightly lower by one jiao. Bian Yuan rose by several points. Bo rice was slightly weak.</p>
<h3>New Kexian Rice from Fujian Sells Very Actively</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for Kexian rice was that only Nanjing continued to have new goods arriving in Shanghai. The appetite of the Kexian merchants was fragrant, but because there were no goods available, the market was held back. 50 bags of new machine-milled rice from Nanjing arrived, priced at $6.60. In addition, 343 bags of brown rice from Nanjing were priced at $5.42, with discounts for lower grades, all purchased by Quanzhou merchants. Ningbo merchants still responded to 140 bags of Jiangxi Gaoji late rice, priced at $7.44. Foreign rice has not opened yet, because the importers bid low, and the owners are unwilling to sell cheaply.</p>
<h3>Sesame Oil Depends Only on Shaobang Route for Sales</h3>
<p>There is a large accumulation of old sesame oil, and new goods have also arrived, but the only route for sales is Shaobang. Therefore, the market situation remains dormant. Yesterday, Shaobang merchants purchased more than 700 bags of Mingguang white sesame, priced at $7.45 to $7.40. 200 to 300 bags of Yingzhou yellow sesame were traded, priced at $8.40.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Raw Sugar White Sugar Falls Half a Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a slight increase in the Dutch exchange rate and a small decrease in the opening gold price, so market sentiment weakened and the trend shifted weaker. The association's price for 24 raw sugar white was initially quoted at $21.55, then $21.50, and finally traded at $21.43, down 1.4 jiao from the previous day. The 20 medium sugar white and Dutch red sugar lacked transactions. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was still quoted at $21.90. Zhonghua Guohua cotton white also did not open with the original price. Guangchao merchants opened more than 200 small boxes of Gaozhuang sliced green sugar, priced at $12.50, and more than 300 bags of Chaoqing sugar, with Tijiazhuang Qing at $15.80 to $15.60, and lower grades at $15. Zhang Diaoqing quoted at $14.70, and a telegram was sent to inquire. Yesterday, a reply was received, stating that it must be $15 before they would unload, so no transaction was made.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Autumn Cocoon Harvest Expected to Be Bumper</h3>
<p>Changan Autumn Silkworms Cocooning</p>
<p>This year's autumn silkworms are all raised with improved breeds. The ant rearing is not weak, and the development is good. However, the mulberry leaves are withered and the leaf price is relatively high, so the silkworm cost is not cheap. The early silkworms have already cocooned, and a bumper harvest is expected.</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Still Difficult to Progress</p>
<p>Overseas silk market is still trending flat and weak. New York factory sales are stagnant. Silk telegrams are not turning. Shanghai European firms are covering short positions. Yesterday, Dachang and others imported 20 packages of white factory silk and 10 packages of yellow factory silk at a fixed price.</p>
<h3>Core-Pulled Zhenmei Tea Trade Still Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yanghang tea market in this port saw the Yingzhuang Jintiao Tianyu Xiehe Baochang and other firms importing core-pulled Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi and other routes, and the trade was not lonely. The selling price opened at $170-180, which was $4-5 lower than before. Ordinary Zhenmei tea still has no major development. As for eyebrow green tea, high-grade goods are still trending firm and popular, while medium and low-grade goods remain sparse. The market for other Gongxi and Xiami teas remained unchanged.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Hunan Lotus Seed Hankou Telegram Indicates Decline</h3>
<p>The sales of Hunan lotus seeds have been sluggish recently, and the trend is flat and weak. Land prices have also loosened. According to yesterday's telegram from Hankou, Heng lotus seeds fell by about two liang per dan, to 24 liang and 2 qian. Therefore, the market price here has also been shaken. Yesterday, top-grade Xiangtan lotus seeds were quoted at $63, Jiuxi lotus seeds at $60, and Hengzhou Changde lotus seeds at $59.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Lifeless</h3>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has been showing a sluggish and difficult-to-revive trend. The trade in the northern route has been affected by the Yellow River breach and has become exhausted. The Yangtze River route, such as Anqing, Nanjing, Hankou, and Wuhu, still has some demand, but the number is limited. The formerly popular Jiujiang and Nanchang ports have been affected by the military situation (suppression of communists) and the trade is unremarkable. There is also little trade in Fujian and Zhejiang. Local factories in this port have also been very few recently, leading to an almost standstill in the entire market. It can be said to be the most deserted era in recent years. As a result, the standards of various goods have mostly declined. For example, tinplate, bamboo steel, blue lead, pure antimony, steel, and other varieties are all in a downward trend. There is not a single variety that is improving. Although there is an upward trend in spot tin, it is out of stock and there is no market. Other than that, there is nothing to report.</p>
<h3>Asphalt (Medium) Like Pine</h3>
<p>He Ben, also known as Ben Che: produced in Jiaxing, Zhejiang. The goods are similar to Chaxue. The outer packing is a grass rope bag, and the shape is also round, about a chi high. The odor is better than any other. The annual production is only more than 10,000 dan.</p>
<p>Xiaoxi, also known as Huiben: produced in Tunxi, Xiuning and other places in Anhui. The goods are the same as Chaxue. The size is very small, only 50 jin per pile. The shape is like a small wine urn, pointed at the bottom and large at the top. The outer packing is a bag, and there is a small wooden piece inside. The annual production is only about three to four thousand dan.</p>
<p>Hongding: produced in Yuqian, Jiangxi. It is similar to Xiaoxi. The size and shape are also the same. However, the outer packing is a rice straw bag, said to be excellent for making red candles. The production is not large, only about 1,000 dan.</p>
<p>Taihu: produced in Taihu, Anhui. The goods are mixed in quality. The size and shape are the same as Macheng. The outer packing is also the same. The annual production is about 8,000 to 9,000 dan.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>"Stealing" and "Robbing"</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>丨Reply to Mr. "Ganxu" on "Talking About Poverty"丨</p>
<p>Not long ago, I talked about "poverty" in this publication. What I meant was: "Poverty" is the most stimulating and fulfilling life; only by going through the class of "poverty" can there be permanent, great, and true creation. However, many "poor people" cannot bear the hardship of "poverty" and go "stealing" and "robbing," which is their great mistake in viewpoint and action. Because after "stealing" and "robbing," they are no longer "poor," and they can rely on it to be fed, clothed, and enjoy themselves. However, in fact, the personal warmth, food, and enjoyment gained from their "stealing" and "robbing" will not benefit more people other than the few who carried out the "stealing" and "robbing." Instead, it will add a few more vigorous bosses to the "poverty" manufacturing plant. So, fundamentally, this is a reactionary, erroneous, narrow, incomplete, and individualistic concept! There are also those who cannot conquer the "suffering" of "poverty" and commit suicide. This is truly the most contemptible, shameful, and weak ugliness exposed! Because they do not understand that "poverty" is a raging flame that can burn out passionate, upward, and dynamic emotions. They do not understand that "poverty" is the lighthouse of a fulfilling life, illuminating us to strive and create practically on the journey of life. Of course, they will not know the cause of the "poverty" illness and where to diagnose the "poverty" pulse. I believe that my words are not entirely empty words divorced from reality, because the world revolutionary writer Gorky was completely beaten in the waves of "poverty" thousands or even countless times and finally succeeded.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, in this publication, Mr. "Ganxu," because a friend also committed suicide in the Hong Kong current in front of the "Cannot Die" sign on Yanziji, used it as evidence to counter my argument. The reason is: His friend is indeed weak, but if his friend could "steal" and "rob," he would not have committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. Finally, he also proposed that "stealing" and "robbing" are the "instincts" of "human beings," not "shameful" and "promising" slogans.</p>
<p>In fact, this evidence will never become evidence. The reason is, I have already explained it in "Talking About Poverty." The previous paragraph of this article also said a bit. Now, let me add some more. Let's take Mr. "Gan" 's friend as an example: Assuming that Mr. "Gan" 's friend really went "stealing" and "robbing" as Mr. "Gan" imagined, then, it is not a question that his friend will not die in vain, but he is also full of hope of getting rich, at least, hope of personal warmth, food, and enjoyment. From then on, he personally is a happy person who is no longer "poor" and no longer "suffering"! However, what are the benefits for the public? ... And assuming that this is indeed a method of chasing away "poverty" and eliminating "suffering," then the "poor people" will all go their own way to bury themselves in this "stealing" and "robbing" that can lead to personal warmth, food, and enjoyment. Then, of course, all the passionate, upward, and dynamic creative emotions will be shattered, the light on the "lighthouse" will be extinguished, the fire in the "furnace" will be extinguished, and the front line of striving and advancing will be eased and eventually shaken. The future, in addition to the pursuit of personal "stealing" and "robbing," is still personal "stealing" and "robbing"! The world becomes a reactionary, erroneous, incomplete, and individualistic world! ...</p>
<p>But, but Mr. "Gan" 's friend is still a contemptible, promising weakling in front of the "Cannot Die" sign on Yanziji!</p>
<p>Finally, from "stealing a country" to "stealing a hook," it is proven that this is a world of "stealing" and "robbing" robbers. However, I do not believe that "stealing" and "robbing" is the inevitable reflection of "poverty" in action. What's more, I deny that it is the "instinct" of "human beings"!</p>
<h3>Everyone Has a Jealous Heart</h3>
<p>— Zhen Zhi</p>
<p>Mencius said, "The heart of compassion is possessed by all." The meaning of this sentence seems to be that if people see something tragic, they will naturally feel compassion. However, I don't think so. A beggar follows behind a well-dressed, wealthy young man, calling him "young master" repeatedly, hoping that he will show some compassion and give him a copper coin. What happens? He follows him for a long way and is subjected to curses like "Get out of here," "Pig," and "Annoying." From this, it seems that asking for people's compassion is clearly not easy. Furthermore, our country, because it lost the three northeastern provinces, begged for the compassion of the League of Nations, but the result was the same as the beggar and the wealthy young man. This further proves that "seeking compassion from others" is impossible. So "the heart of compassion is possessed by all" becomes a generality. I want to change the generality into a reality, so I rashly changed it to "everyone has a jealous heart," which is also for a good reason.</p>

<h3>Lamenting the Yellow River</h3>
<p>— Chang Zunxian</p>
<p>The Yellow River collapses, inundating Mount Hua and Song,</p>
<p>The Fen River flows west, the Ji River east,</p>
<p>The rushing, overturning sea is powerful and surging,</p>
<p>People and objects are like mountains, terrifying dragons,</p>
<p>The whole family sleeps in one house at night,</p>
<p>Swept by the waves into the whale's belly,</p>
<p>One hundred li away, the sound of flying waves can still be heard,</p>
<p>Near, one cannot hear the sound of people crying,</p>
<p>One only sees corpses floating with the waves,</p>
<p>Birds pecking at backs, fish hitting heads,</p>
<p>Wanting to salvage, the water is rapid, difficult to row,</p>
<p>Standing alone in the setting sun, tears streaming down,</p>
<p>Year after year, sighing at the suffering of the sand fields,</p>
<p>Blood and flesh in a mess, fattening jackals and tigers,</p>
<p>Du's bones are still rotting in the soil,</p>
<p>How can they rot with the drifting sand?</p>
<p>It is said that warlords are inherently unkind,</p>
<p>Why is the River God not merciful and called a god?</p>
<p>If it is said that the calamity is destined by Heaven,</p>
<p>Why do all the innocent people die?</p>
<p>Raising my head, I ask Yu Chen,</p>
<p>The potters and modelers lost their great balance,</p>
<p>Dumb springs, disastrous waters,</p>
<p>Why not sink together?</p>
<p>Is there no virtue to make up for it,</p>
<p>Why does Royal Heaven not care?</p>
<p>Why are you not respectful, and my heart does not submit?</p>
<p>There is much idle happiness in half a hall,</p>
<p>Don't you hear the carriages and horses come and go, the sound of police clearing the way,</p>
<p>Without sorrow, one song rests the mountains and crouches. (Instead of reward)</p>
<p>People only know that the two words "jealousy" are used exclusively for disputes between the sexes, fighting, etc., but they do not know what ingredients form the elements of "jealousy." Some say that of course oxygen is the main element, but what raw materials are used to make oxygen? They can't answer when asked directly. In fact, it's very easy. It's nothing more than the raw materials created under the "not wanting others to touch what you love." In other words, this is oxygen. From that oxygen, apart from the jealousy that should exist in the disputes and fights between the sexes, we can say that the pursuit of fame and profit by merchants and villagers cannot be separated from the ingredients of jealousy. The power struggles and money scraping of adults and gentlemen cannot be separated from the ingredients of jealousy, because based on the principle of raw materials forming, it can be believed without a doubt.</p>
<p>Vinegar is a must-eat, because it comes with life. Why is that? Don't you often see rape cases in the newspaper... disputes... fights (for women)... etc., all of which are enough to show that vinegar is innate. Then, merchants love money, buy Japanese goods, adults love money, scrape the people's fat, are inevitable. So I changed "the heart of compassion is possessed by all" to "everyone has a jealous heart," doesn't it seem more appropriate!</p>

<h3>A Proper Match</h3>
<p>"Miss Peiying in the × mansion is getting more beautiful than before. Relying on her natural intelligence, she is only seventeen years old this year and has already graduated from high school. In the near future, she will go abroad to study at a university and will definitely bring back very glorious female doctorate, master, and bachelor's degrees, returning in great style. Let's see which young master will be lucky enough to marry this talented and beautiful daughter as his wife." The people in × town were all thinking like this in their minds. Mr. × and his wife have also spent many years of hard work on the marriage of Peiying, this "pearl in their palm." Although many people have come to propose marriage, they always consider it carefully, hoping to choose a family that is "a proper match," so that their beloved daughter's lifelong happiness will not be delayed.</p>
<p>Today, another wave of "Peiying's marriage problem" rose in Mr. ×'s heart. He thought that his daughter's age was not too young, and that she had already graduated from high school. On the principle of "a man should marry when he is old, and a woman should marry when she is old," Peiying's lifelong happiness could no longer be delayed. There have been many proposals of marriage these two days, so he must choose a good one to agree to, so that he can fulfill a kind of responsibility as a parent. Thinking of this, he hurried in to discuss it with his wife.</p>
<p>"Madam, I think Peiying's age is not too young. As the ancients said, 'A man should marry when he is old, and a woman should marry when she is old.' Recently, many families have come to propose marriage, so we should choose one that is 'a proper match' as soon as possible, so that we can fulfill our own worries."</p>
<p>His wife agreed with him and replied: "Old Master, you are right. Our children's marriages are indeed the heavenly duty of parents, and we should arrange her lifelong happiness as soon as possible, which also fulfills our responsibility. What's more, if we delay any longer, she is studying at school, and now there is a lot of talk about free love outside every day. I'm afraid Peiying will also see it and follow suit. Like the girl from the Wang family next door who eloped with someone last year and caused trouble, we would lose all face."</p>
<p>"Yes! But which of the families that have come to propose marriage recently do you think is good? We'll discuss it and reply to them." Mrs. × lowered her head and thought silently for a while. "As I see it, the Xu family's child is good. He is born extraordinarily handsome, and I heard that his knowledge is not bad, but his family is a bit poor, not good enough for our family! The one with the surname Lu is a better match. His family has more than 10,000 mu of land, and he has a lot of savings. Although the young master's talent is a bit worse, Peiying will not have a hard time marrying there. What do you think?"</p>
<p>Mr. × shook his head and said: "Wrong! I heard that the Lu family's child is not only ignorant and bad-tempered, but he has also become addicted to opium, so I don't agree with him very much!"</p>
<p>"Old Master, you are wrong. As long as a person has plenty of food and clothing in this world, what does it matter what knowledge and learning they have? What's more, people in the world today all 'value clothing over people'. If you have money, people will respect you. If you have knowledge, who will care about you! Speaking of his family's young master being addicted to opium, I think he has millions of dollars of wealth, so he doesn't have to worry about eating himself poor. And as the saying goes, 'A rich man eating opium protects his family property,' so smoking is irrelevant!"</p>
<p>Mr. × was enlightened by his virtuous wife's explanation of worldly affairs. In addition, he thought of the four words "a proper match," so he said happily: "Let's do it that way! Although he is an opium addict, he is still 'a proper match,' hehe."</p>

<h3>How to Solicit Donations?</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>Many readers encounter difficult problems, and once they seek your guidance, you readily provide instructions, resolving many dire situations. This is a truly commendable thing. Since you possess the ability to compassionately guide and rescue people from hardship, I trust you will accept my request and be happy to advise me.</p>
<p>My hometown is in She County, southern Huizhou. I came to Shanghai at a young age and have been apprenticed in a cloth store. Time flies, and it has been more than a decade. However, the compensation I receive as an apprentice is never sufficient. Fortunately, I am thrifty and manage to support my family with the meager income I earn through hard work, enduring this difficult life. I deeply feel the weight of my efforts.</p>
<p>The situation is as follows: Last month, I received a letter from my hometown stating that on the 14th day of the fifth month, torrential rain suddenly fell in the southern She County area, causing flash floods. The floodwaters surged like galloping horses, and the water depth on flat ground reached over ten feet. In an instant, the area became a waterlogged land, submerging fields and collapsing houses. The cries of the displaced people and the floating corpses were a tragic sight. The disaster was unprecedented in its severity. My family lives there and has suffered the same misfortune, with the affected area filled with corpses. Upon receiving this news, those of us living abroad were extremely distressed. After the local authorities reported the details to the provincial government, a month passed, and there was still no relief plan. Therefore, the village elders discussed and initiated the "She County Fifth District Flood Relief Association." The initiators are responsible for fundraising, hoping to gather small contributions to save the lives of those who have survived. Just the day before yesterday, I received a donation booklet from the association, urging me to quickly raise funds from abroad to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>Sir, rescuing those in distress is a natural duty, especially when it involves our hometown. Considering the bond of kinship, it becomes even more imperative. However, I am unfortunate to be an apprentice, and I do not have the status to solicit donations. Reflecting on my financial situation, as described above, I am in a difficult position. Although my heart is filled with a desire to help, I lack the means to provide assistance, which is truly shameful. Alas! In this distorted society where power and wealth dominate, only dignitaries and wealthy individuals can easily raise five or ten thousand at a moment's notice with a mere word. If someone of my humble status sincerely begs for help, who will care? Who will consider the plight of the many victims? Since ancient times, friends with tight finances and frugal habits are inevitably few, and even if there are one or two who care, they are in the same situation, unable to offer substantial help. Sending the donation booklet back as is would be a heavy burden on my conscience. Moreover, how would I face my hometown in the future? Therefore, I am worried day and night, more so than if I were there myself. Sir, you are a great benefactor who helps people achieve good things. I implore you to provide guidance on how to use what method to make this donation booklet, which many lives rely upon, be successful in meeting its purpose. Please advise me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Cheng Lie-fu</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Compassion exists in everyone's heart. However, "viewing others' hunger as one's own hunger and others' drowning as one's own drowning" is merely an exaggeration. In reality, how many people truly have such feelings? Therefore, most ordinary people adopt a policy of "self first" and "love your family and extend it to others."</p>
<p>Now that your hometown has suffered a flood, affecting your family, the most important thing is to find ways to help your family. If you can do it without relying on public assistance, you will be leaving more resources for the public to help other victims. As for raising funds for relief, it is certainly a good thing, but it is the obligation of those who have surplus resources. You do not need to force yourself.</p>
<p>In this society where poverty is widespread, it is normal not to be able to donate money. There is no need to lose face or be ashamed to return to your hometown. Although you cannot donate money, the fact that you do not need help yourself means you are not extremely poor. Moreover, even if you are truly destitute, there is no shame in it. It is only disgraceful to exploit the situation, raise money for personal gain, and fail to account for it later.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (12)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Scene 1: Life and Death</p>
<p>Soldier Geng: Reporting to the company commander, the person is here.</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: Bring a few more lamps from inside.</p>
<p>Company Commander: What's your name?</p>
<p>Youth: My name is Wu Chunshan. I escaped from Youbeikou. Here's a letter, please take a look, sir. (Takes out a letter from his torn clothes. Also, a packet of silver coins.) And forty yuan.</p>
<p>(The Company Commander reads the letter, playing with the silver, seemingly wanting to confiscate the money.)</p>
<p>Youth: Since Youbeikou was taken by the Japanese soldiers, more than half of the houses in our village have been burned down. Many people have also been killed. We are hoping that the Sir will send troops to counterattack, drive back the Japanese soldiers, and save the lives of our people. We are all desperately poor. We managed to scrape together forty yuan, so that the brothers can buy cigarettes and food on the road. Although it is a very small amount, it is truly our heartfelt offering. Please don't laugh at us.</p>
<p>Company Commander: Is that so? Good. (Puts the money into his pocket) Tomorrow I'll talk to the division commander. You can go back now. It's nothing, let him go back. (The Company Commander leaves, followed by the Platoon Leader. The youth is stunned. The soldiers also look at each other.) (No one speaks, silence. About three minutes pass.)</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: (Imitating the Company Commander's actions and tone) Is that so? Good. Tomorrow I'll talk to the division commander. You can go back now. It's nothing, let him go back.</p>
<p>Everyone: Hahahahaha.</p>
<p>Soldier Jia: Damn it, convenience, a moment later it's forty.</p>
<p>Youth: Is our money going to be lost?</p>
<p>Soldier Geng: Who knows?</p>
<p>Everyone: Hahahaha (bitterly laughs)</p>
<p>Soldier Jia: You owe it to this fool! You have too much money. (Suddenly, there are violent cannon sounds, machine gun sounds.)</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: What's happening? Are they attacking? (Another sound)</p>
<p>Soldier Geng: We've already retreated, are they still attacking? (Rifle sounds) Listen, you can hear the gun sounds.</p>
<p>Soldier Wu: It's really getting close. (Soldier Jia is the first to lie down, preparing to fire, the rest follow suit.)</p>
<p>Soldier Jia: Tell them all to come out, now is the time to fight for our lives! (Gunshots get closer and denser)</p>
<p>Soldier Ding: We retreated one hundred and fifty li in one day, that's considered fast running, are they really going to chase us? (Bugle sounds, it's an emergency assembly order.)</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: (Rushing in.) Quick! Everyone line up.</p>
<p>(With one command, everyone stands up)</p>
<p>Soldier Ding: Platoon leader! What's going on?</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: Quick! Quick! The Japanese soldiers are attacking again.</p>
<p>Soldier Yi: Then why aren't we counterattacking?</p>
<p>Soldier Geng: What's going on now? Are we retreating again?</p>
<p>Soldier Jia: Aren't we counterattacking? Are we really just waiting to die?</p>
<p>Platoon Leader: No questions. There are orders from above. Retreat. Quick!</p>
<p>(Two of the loudest cannons fire, shells landing in the middle of the soldiers. Flames, black smoke, dust flying. Cries, shouts, gunfire. Black smoke spreads from the stage to the audience. The curtain slowly falls.)</p>
