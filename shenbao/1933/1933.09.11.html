<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c13">最近之廬山會議　　梓 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>三閱月以來。。。黨國軍政要人。迭次會議於廬山。而最近六七兩日之會議。尤爲國人所注目。蓋宋財長在海外百餘日。遍歷歐美重要各國。成立棉麥大借欵。進行與國聯技術合作。其所發生之作用。不特足以影響今後之國内問題。亦且有關於列强在華之形勢。方宋氏在歸國途中時。日本已眼望一虚影而有所致力。國人亦對宋氏歸後之時局。作種種之推測與希望。今宋到廬山。與蔣汪孫交换其意見。事雖有異於黨國公式之會議。而其性質之重要。則尤過之。會議時期中。一消息之披露。聞者即據以推想今後時局之趨向。並作種種之解釋。實以此也。</p>
<p>日來汪宋孫會畢回京滬。各發表談話。會議内容。大略可知。茲綜核各人談話。將諸重要問題。分析如次。</p>
<p>第一。外交問題。汪謂中央决定之方針。宋甚贊同。無多大討論宋對此不發表意見。且謂曾否提議與有何决定。未便有所表示。孫詳論外交方針。以民族生存爲目的。而謂外交策略。［當以適應國際形勢及國内環境爲凖則。在方法上可以隨時隨地。稍予變更。］</p>
<p>第二。政局問題。汪宋孫均謂國府不改組。惟承認全國經濟委員會將擴大組織。孫在立法院報告。將以此爲實行經濟統制。又謂。使其能力充實。可負建設責任及與國聯作技術上合作。</p>
<p>第三。棉麥大借欵用途問題。談話者一致承認爲會議中主要問題。聲明全部用於建設事業。决不用作軍政等費。所謂建設事業。孫釋爲產生事業。汪釋爲復興農村經濟之建設。欵項保管之委員會。孫謂將隸屬於全國經濟委員會。以符統制之權。</p>
<p>第四。五全會問題。應由中央决。定則當然之事也。</p>
<p>吾人就汪宋孫談話。分析上述諸問題以後。覺此次廬山會議。於國内問題。可謂已有相當之結果。而對外之究將如何。則依然未能使國人得到明瞭之觀念。雖然。目前日本正向一虚影而凝望。國人亦對日本方面所凝望而惴惴以懼。此對外問題。實具有極重之性質可知也。</p>

<p>兩路管理局局長黃伯樵·副局長吳紹曾、發表對修復上海北站落成之希望云修建上海北站、是一二八的結果、一二八又是九一八的結果、所以今天因修建上海北站完成招待各界參觀、决不是表示歡喜慶賀、不過有幾點意思、想借這機會報告報告、希望大家於實地參觀以後、有一種認識、隨後共加以指敎及恊助、第一點、我們要想報告的便是鐡路以營業爲主、而國營鐡路、尤以商業化爲主、照現在的鐡路局組織、實行營業的中心、則在車務處、所以我們現在仍把車務處設在兩路中心的上海北站、而車務處最近修正編制、把文牘課改組爲總務課、調度課改組爲運輸課、商務課改組爲營業課、在這營業課下面、又分文事股·客運股·貨運股·編查股·交際股·和餐務股、同時在今天起、實行最近在上海市靜安寺路四零七號所設的營業所、也屬於車務處營業課、差不多是一個支店、在不久將來、還想在上海市的南部、有同樣的設置、我們要内外一致的澈底實現國營鐡路商業化、第二點、我們想要報告的、便是鐡路爲民衆服務、應以使民衆享受充分之便利與安全爲主、故本路除列車外、對於車站上之設備、也力求整頓、先指定數大站爲模範站、加以刷新、上海北站爲兩路的中心、其所在地之上海市、又占吾國經濟上最重要的地位、往來旅客、每月約三十餘萬　　北站落成禮後留影（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>人、但自站屋被焚、旅客久無待車處所、而三四等車旅客、更向乏相當的待車設備、現在吾們將上海北站修復、旣劃底層的一部、供頭二等車旅客使用、更於站屋後面、利用雨棚配窗户、設置坐位、添設新式男女厕所、備三四等車旅客使用、又特設行李存放處、使旅客在上海僅有短時間之逗留者、可將行李暫行寄放、不必隨身携帶、以免累贅、與交通部上海電話局特約、装設公共電話、也可通長途電話、此外有線及無線電報與郵政、擬並與交通當局商洽、陸續在站添設、直接發遞、又北站旣爲兩路重要車站、出入車站之旅客及車輛、最爲擁擠、苟無相當管理方法、秩序卽爲混亂、故此次修復上海北站、同時把站内站外交通、切實加以整頓、就站内說、向日對於旅客及行李車往來、其路線混雜不分、今則分别規定、使有條不紊、在站外又劃汽車和人力車停車地位、及其路線配置警察崗位、使旅客和車輛、各依所向往來、不致衝撞、發生危險、又兩路車站尙無公共餐室之設備、此次北站修復、擬卽舉辦、使往來旅客、隨時可獲經濟而清潔之飲食、此外擴充南京下關站之雨棚月台、並修葺其他各大站、也於同時完成、第三點、我們想要報告的便是鐡路運輸、以迅速可靠爲主、所以我們最先致力的、使列車照規定的時刻準時到達、這一點旣辦到、然後再求在規定時間内縮短行駛時間、在本年六月一日變更之行車時刻、一部份便爲達到此目的、像京滬日間特别快車便由最長的八小時十五分、縮短爲六小時五十分、貨車由無定時之開駛、改爲每日上下八次、滬杭零貨列車、也由間日一開、改爲逐日行駛、現在我們重行測騐機車拉力、從九月一日起、把各項列車行駛時間、再行縮短、如客列車第一次及第二次、京閘特快通車均减三十分、（由京至滬、現在只需六小時二十分）、第五次、京滬夜特快車减少三十分、第十一次及第十二次滬京三四等慢車行駛時間、較前分别减少一小時十五分及二小時、第三零一次及三零二次國内聯運特快車、分别减少半小時及三十五分、貨列車縮短尤多、例如第三一一次京滬貨物列車、較前减少十五小時零八分、第三一二次貨物列車更减少十七小時十二分、（從前貨列車由京至滬、時間最短的、也要十九小時三十七分、現在最短的只要十六小時二十五分）、此外又加開客貨混合列車、使零星貨車或已装貨車之未能爲貨列車掛走者、都隨时可在沿途配掛運送格外迅速、但我們不就以爲满足、以後還當在可能範圍之内、繼續的縮短、綜括上面所報告的三點、吾們惟一旨趣、在把十二分的决心、用最合理的方式、經營鐡路、完成爲民衆服務的使命、不過當局者迷、旁觀者淸、所以我們要借修復上海北站的機會、邀集各界領袖、來實地看我們一部份的設施、聽我們的簡單報告、以後隨時隨地給我們指示與恊助、使我們對於做而未善的、可以改善、應做未做的、可以補做、這是我們萬分渴望的、</p>

<p>仰游破全國紀錄</p>
<p>楊元華一分二九秒四　　第二項百米仰游决賽、日昨預賽以一分三二秒四創全國新紀錄之楊元華、又缩短其時間、以一分二九秒四、重創全國紀錄、（舊紀錄爲一分三八秒曾榮忠）殊可喜也、楊單手交换潑水、如有韻律、速度如一、從容迫進、深具造詣、　　女子仰游僅二人比賽、一爲大塊頭龔希岌、一爲小姑娘鲍冷雪、一大一小、相映成趣、龔大塊頭入水時、因身體笨重、且不得其法、致水花飛潑、濺及池旁觀者、受累不少、结果大者勝、而小者敗、[P千五百米&gt;</p>
<p>千五百米自由式决賽、須來回三十次、（卽六十單程）四百米冠軍周達雲、富於長力、身軀隨水花蕩漾、躍躍前進、至一米路程、已超出第二人二池、而鄭官憲則於十六來回時、因力不濟而出水、周則始終如一、勇而不懈、最後結果、周勝第二陳玉泉一百米、時間爲二十六分五五秒四、</p>

<p>男子組日昨預賽以三分二七秒二創全國新紀錄之黎日新、决賽中、反被楊元華壓倒、而楊亦破全國紀錄、且時間爲三分十九秒六、更破黎之新紀錄、黎則屈居亞軍、時間似亦較其預賽者進步、（舊紀錄爲三分二七秒八馬智輝）楊黎二人、競爭殊烈、全池頓逞緊張空氣、而黎卒以　　三四碼落後、</p>

<p>男子有劇戰妇子頗發血</p>
<p>男子百米自由式决賽、爲各項中最激昂之一幕、尹衍均鑒於五十米之落後、力爭上流、與周瑞劇烈競爭、餘子亦不放鬆、興波作浪、聲勢雄壯、周獲冠軍、尹屈居亞軍、相差有三碼之遙、時間一分十三秒一、　　女子組起游時、頗爲發噱、第一次胡其瑛躍躍欲試、令未下而先落水、同時胡其媛每身不由主、隨之落水中、起水重游、二人復胆小如鼠、令下後、其瑛復呆而不下水、繼見他人前去、急躍水中、而其媛見其瑛不下水、復立在水中、繼見其瑛下水、始再前游、已被龔希岌游前三四米矣、此由於經騐缺少之故、結果龔第一、而其媛小姐中途改游蛙式、落第三焉、</p>

<p>＝農民健康當竭力重視＝</p>
<p>＝新醫新藥應普及民衆＝</p>
<p>農村　衛生工作，有二重意議：</p>
<p>（一）我們承認現在中國最勤勞的是農民，而最窮苦的亦是農民；</p>
<p>中國内地農民所過的生活，眞是非人的生活，（也許他們自已還不）</p>
<p>知道）：在健康方面上講，不知多少面黃肌瘦的農民，仍舊是牛馬般的工作着。一次虎疫發生，就可死去多少農民，一次天花發生，就可死去多少小農民；偶而有點小病，便不能不請舊醫藥，枉死城中，不知又添了多少寃魂；產婦產兒之死於舊式接生者之手，又不知有若干人；可憐可憐！我們學新醫藥的人，難道就坐視我們的同</p>
<p>胞，受罪枉死嗎？起來！我們要解除他們的痛苦，我們要替他們預防疾病，治療疾病；並且要想法使他們的身體健康；使農民們安居樂業；這便是農村衛生工作最重要的意義。農本復興，是當前最急切的問題，要解决這問題，固然全賴政府與民衆的恊助，而其中有一部分的責任，我們新醫界，却自已要放在肩頭上的。　　（二）我們回想中國施行新醫藥敎育已很悠久了，但是試問享受新醫藥的利益的是那些人？每年醫藥學校畢業學校畢業的，留學返國的，大都總在都市裏，可憐的鄉村小民，何嘗能享受到新醫藥的一些利益？</p>
<p>他們因爲享受不到新醫藥的利益，便自然而然地不信仰新醫了。諸位！我們不是要想做到全國的醫藥科學化嗎？起來！先從鄉村做起。十年以後，科學的新醫，怕不就普遍全國，非科學的舊醫，怕不就完全淘汰了麽？</p>
<p>我們今天提出了這個問題，有兩重希望：　　第一，希望全國的新醫藥界，從今天起，注意這問题，貢獻我們實施的計劃和意見，並親自到民間，着手工作。</p>
<p>第二，希望全國各處的讀者，各把本鄉的衛生狀况，及其所希望改良的地方，寫給我們，我們當隨時公之大衆，以爲研究和改進的方針。</p>
<h3 id="c192">焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商槯（續） <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>焦先生說：「國醫的短處；在理論方面摻雜了一部分玄學意味，和現代的科學對照起來，自然有许多地方不合，····少年國醫。他們雖然學着國醫，但對於國醫中間玄學的理論，很能表示放棄，至少亦存着懹疑的態度，因爲國醫是實騐主義，並不重視理論，一般西醫，以爲玄學是國醫的基本意識。」焦先生不約不鬆，我告訴一句話，實騐是要用物質文明的意識，優良的器械，和生數理化的素養，并且要診察精確，其所得和成籍才算細密，才可以避免錯誤，才可以算近於眞理，在學術上才可以</p>
<p>眞有價値，若是像焦先生所承認物質文明不進步，無優良的器械運用，診察不精確的國醫們，在學理上探討起來，請問什麽本領來實騐？用什麽工具來做實騐？有什麽智識來判斷實騐所得到的現像？淮南子齊俗訓說道：「夫胡人見贋，不知其可以爲布也，越人見毳，不知其可以爲旃也，故不通於物者，難與言化。」貴國醫們在日常經騐當中，或者偶然有很寳貴的現象呈露，也只是莫明其妙，朝着望望：以領神會就算了，請問有什麽進一步的辦法？焦先生把實騐兩字放在國醫手裏，似乎有點脫離「從學理上探討」範圍，而做起誇大宣傳來了　　焦先生吓！現在貴國醫們所做的戲法，只好呌做「傳統的習慣」；一個病人來了，照例給他把把脈，照例給他開一方，有熱無汗，照例用麻黃，袪痰止　，照例用半夏，利水照例用茯苓，脈沉細不起，照例用附子乾　，夏令到了照例用點鮮荷葉，病人服了藥好了，當然是我的功，不好了，脈案的末脚，本來有「須防變端」四個大字寫在那邊，還可以說一句果不出吾料哩。現在社會上普遍做爺娘的；碰着小孩子有病了，照例结結招招魂靈，燒燒紙錠，喫喫行軍散，喉嚨有點痛，照例吞吞六神丸，肚子有點不舒腹，照例括括痧，國醫的工作，和這點勾當完全是一樣，完全是莫明其妙的循行故事，所以我說是「傳統的習慣。」至於把脈是否可以診得出病，麻黃，半夏，茯苓，附子，乾　，鮮荷葉，以及招魂靈，燒紙錠。喫行軍散，吞六神丸，括痧，是否能治病，病好了，是否是麻黃半夏茯苓附子乾薏鮮荷葉招魂爲什麽紙錠喫行軍散吞六神丸括痧等等功效，和</p>
<p>爲什麽缘故會秦效等等，却朝着望望，完全不明白。所以國醫們所工作的「傳統的習慣」，只不過向科學醫家供給點實騐材料就是了，就此要算是實騐，這個誇大宣傳，未免太有點難爲情了。</p>
<p>焦先生一方面把實騐主義的招牌掛在國醫門前，說並不重視理論，一方面却資備醫家一從學理上控討」，「從學理上研究」，我不知道焦先生的心目中，理論和學理，有什麽分别？</p>
<p>學化的可能性，說是科學化了，就不能稱之爲國醫，關於後一點，學術儘可以合於科學，而國與國之間，儘可以有不同的學。」這就是焦先生把英文德文日文國文來比英醫德醫日醫國醫的錯誤，我在本商槯的第一段裏面，已經辨明過了，恕不再說。</p>
<p>焦先生說：「在經騐方面，····他的診察方式，雖不合科學，却能符合實際，由於他的診察見解，施行治療，理論儘管不確，效力都有應騐，好比三加五加八，他只能把答案是十點告訴你，式子却立不出來。但治病不比研究其他别種科學，要求答案，是比開列式子更加迫切。」從這幾句話看起來，焦先生似乎只懂六粗淺的算學，那三加五加八，這種初等小學簡單問題，固然用不着開列式子，用心算就可以答覆出來的，若是遇着高深數理，恐怕式子是必要的罷！粗淺的診察，譬如「某人夫人，月經有一月多不來了，飯有點吃不下，時常要惡心，是有孕的了。」這種診斷，不必請敎貴國醫，就是一字不識的鄉下老婆婆，也能夠說得出；但是子宮或者卵巢生起毛病來，也有上述種種證候，疑似之間，要判斷他究竟是孕是病，這時候，或者究竟是孕非孕，對於法律發生問題，對於家庭發行影響，須得確賓地證明一下，這時候，恐怕要用着複雜的算式了；不但鄉下老婆婆不中用，就是貴國醫的一陰搏陽别，謂之有子，」和「婦人手少陰脈動甚者，姙子也，」等脈理，也不中用，這種答案，在學理上探討起來，恐怕不是三加五加八那麽簡單，可以用心算來做成的罷。所以立不出式子來的算學，只能算初等小學校的簡單問題，不能應用到高深複雜科學上去，這就是我上文所說「小道可觀，致遠恐泥，君子不爲，的意思。</p>
<p>焦先生旣然曉得國醫診察不精確，旣然曉得連式子也立不出來，那末貴國醫們所有理論和事實的矛盾現象，央忠實研究學問的人，也非歸納到「幸中偶合」四個字裏面不可，從前有天良的舊醫，有研究思想的舊醫，也都坦白的說是幸中，丨章潢，王勳臣，徐靈胎，丨丨唯有存心欺人的一班市僧式貴國醫，說是成效歷着，焦先生也竟會說「以領神會，」說「心知其所以然而不能告人，」說「他的短處就是他的長處，」跳出學理探討的圈子外來說涵話。　　焦先生呀！經騐是靠不住的，憑着經騐，不把科學實騐來嚴密審查一下，是很容易發生錯誤的，我所做的「皇漢醫學批評」裏面，有一段論經騐實騐的話，似乎値得貢獻在焦先生和國人面前，我把他節錄在下面，請虚心參考一下！</p>
<p>「譬如在高樓上，把一個銅錢，一根鷄毛，同時往下抛擲，那時銅錢是一直往下墜落，鷄毛却飘飘蕩蕩，隔了許多時候，才會落到地面。這個錢毛落下遠遲不同的事實，是萬人同感的，是没有一個人說不對，是千眞萬確的，恐怕世界上靠得住的經騐，再没有像這個錢毛落下遲遠不同的事實····那裏曉得科學家一出來，用個長玻璃筒，把錢毛装在筒裏面，而且把裏面的空氣抽去了，再顚倒這個筒，就可以實騐得錢毛並落，並不見得誰快誰慢。從此就發明一椿事情；就是物體的下墜現象，不單單是物體和地心吸力的關係，還有眼不見耳不聞的第三者參加在中間，就是受了空氣的影響，這是經騐家做夢也想不到的事情。···經騐是祗有下覺的知道錢速毛遲的現象，什麽第三者參加，第四者屬雜，一槪視而不見，聽而不聞，所以祗不夠認識複雜混成的一個自然界現象，不能分析起來，作進一步的觀察，來明瞭他各個分子活動的本來面目，完成這個現象的精細研究。换一句话說：就是只曉得物理學上所表現的合力，不能實際上再進一步，分析他的分力是怎樣？是從那裏生出來的？只曉得化學上現成的化合，不能從實際上再進一步，分析他的分子是怎樣？是從那種方法合成的？所以單單靠着經騐，是只會利用处自然界現成的東西，各人類本能所發明的事情，他的思想理論，也只有憑着浮淺雜亂的目前現象，來組織空論，再不能循根澈底，作進一步的研究···」</p>
<p>國人！看了這段的話，可以曉得單單經騐是靠不住的！國醫們聲聲口口說經騐，都是把渾成的現象，當做單位，把幸中偶合的複雜現象，當做簡單純一的事實，當做千眞萬確的功效，當做明白曉暢的長處，在學理上探討起來，一點兒價値没也有，焦先生實在不應談說那種話。</p>
<h3 id="c193">藥房營業之眞義（四） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>腦威瑞典之藥房</p>
<p>兩國藥業同一制度，所有藥房均是專門職業性營業，即除正式藥房外，所謂普通藥商店，爲數甚少。其正式藥房名亞泡底格，與德國相似，内容完善，外表輝煌，惟藥師可發賣藥品，換言之，藥房均係藥師所開，故藥房之數目定額甚嚴，即遇店主身故，因之停閉，或添新額時，須先週知公衆，再由政府遴選合格之藥師，與錄取他種公務人員同，亦須審查　高深學問，與藥學上技能，方准其頂替或開設也。　　藥房每日營業時間，計十二小時，即自上午八或九時起，至下午七或八時止，而因顧客便利起見，全市藥房分爲若干組，得以翰値一年中之星期日，節日，及夜間任務，又有多數藥房，聘有合格之女助手執業其間。此種助手，装飾潔白，似稱其職業態度和幹練之技能，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>故其藥房淸潔整齊，良非無因。又其藥師不象作分析及顯微鏡檢查等之試騐室工作，與比利時间，而與歐洲他處藥房則異之。蓋此等工作，社會上已另有專門機關事理其事耳。</p>
<p>查以上數國之藥房營業，可代表歐洲全境藥房業制度，雖有數國家之藥房營業，未必一一盡同，但其正式藥房之營業宗旨，如出一轍。不外以專門職業發揮其技能上之貢獻，爲服務於人類社會之正大宗旨；與普通商店逈有不同，至其道德之養成，雖繩以國家法律，而推源其故，歸功於藥學敎育蓋多多矣（完）</p>

<p>看護士，在新醫藥上很關重要，本應另設專科，加意訓練，但是上海市上，已往的護士，都靠各醫院附設的護士班自由造就。從没有一種標準技能的規定，半工半讀的護士班，雖然於學生醫院雙方有利，然而每每因招生時取才不嚴，入院後敎誨不力，成績未能一致。而况各醫院規模不同，功课多少各異，所習文字有英日德法之分，再加上助產學校畢業生，自以爲降格相就，屈充護士，（其實所學不同未必稱職）而胃稱醫院的診所，居然也濫給護士文憑。於是弄得護士界，品類不齊，程度參差，膽大的流爲雜醫，薄弱的漸至毫無歸宿。現在上海市有二個特别護士會，暫時不過供給病家與醫家的需要，是一種職業介紹機關，但我很希望這兩個會，將來發達，能和醫办的熱以份子。合力起來整理上海的護士界。</p>
<p>除學校之外更有專科研究院，雖爲已經畢業的醫師藥師研求基本醫藥學之所，而並非普通學生肄業之地，然而研究所裏所得的成績，到底就是學理學術的根源，所以本篇中也姑且略事腀列。</p>
<p>研究的機關，可以分爲兩類：第一類就是各學校的研究室，除却供給學生實習之外，自然也就供給各該科的敎授助手敎的作高深的研究工作，照現在各學校的經濟狀，這一類學校研究室，還不能十分發達，如今單論獨立的研究院，都已有下列幾處，可惜不則不全是國人自辦，二則科目尙不能十分多罷了。　　（一）李斯德研究院　是英人李斯德斥資創設的，新屋在本埠愛文義路去年方落成，美輪美奐，氣象萬千，現有中外醫家在内研究，已經開始的是生理學。病理學。傳染病學。三部，然而我國民情閉塞，病理解剖材料還欠豐富，倒狠辜負了這個研究機關。</p>
<p>（二）上海自然科學研究院　是日本退回庚欵中指定文化事業之一，當然日本科學家要在内共同主持和研究，他的们科目有關醫學的是病理學·化學·藥物學·三部，社會上一部份淺見的人，以爲在這時代和日本人往來，終久不妥，然而我們要知道，學術不分國界，尤不講意氣，旣然純粹的國立研究院感受着缺乏，那麽這種研究院，就該十分的利用，十分的注意了。</p>
<p>（三）司法政部法醫研究所　設立在眞茹，是部辦的法醫學研究機關，同時也受各法院委託的檢騐事件，我希望社會上認識眞正法醫新理，免得再像前幾年某律師那種提倡洗寃錄的怪文發現才好。</p>
<p>（四）北平研究院藥物研究部　北平究究院，和中在研究院的組織差不多，此番因時局關係，有一部分遷來上海，如今這藥物系，暫時借駐在中法大學藥學院裏面，但昌藥物的合法研究，是一椿很緩慢的事，决非像奸滑藥商，隨便自稱科學國藥，把無論什麽東西帶上科學帽子，就算了事。社會上人士，對於這種研究院，加以注意，加以督促則可，因嫌他冷静，反而迷信假科學的速成則不可。</p>
<p>（五）衛生試騐所　與英法租界工部局衛生試騐所，雖然都是市衛生機關，而旣有研究室之設備，又有許多材料之供給，假如專家在裏而埋頭用功，也未嘗不可在學術上有很大的供獻。</p>
<p>此外有些中外各國人所立的私爱研究室，大都是一半營業，（代替開業醫作各項檢騐工作）一半研究，雖不敢說他無高深學術可以探討，然而經濟上，助手上，發生了種種困難，所以成爲忽生忽滅的機關，約計現在上海所存者也不過七八家而已。</p>

<p>— 陳方之</p>
<p>對於他們說我壞話的第二層，我也無須答辯，只看我在病家的問答，就可明白，我是並没有一定勸她到上海去的，緃使上海之行，千差萬差，也是他倍自投羅網，至於說我醫術不好，我要將當日看子宮的詳情叙述了。她的子宮口，不是小小圓形或橢圓形的。是不規則的屈曲長形，其旁顯然有侵潤性肥厚，擁腫增殖，其稱稍外翻的粘膜面，正在出血，指頭按之，比較的軟而脆，此乃癌中的性質不良，速於進行者。此種目擊情形，尙有婦科醫負其責，本來四十以上的女子，有不規則子宮出血的病歷，大凡是一位醫生，誰都知道留意於瘤腫，學術高明與否的問題，簡直談也談不到。</p>
<p>如果他們到上海，請一個有名可靠</p>
<p>的婦科醫診察後，說不是癌，如果她死後，他們將她的屍體付解剖，說不是子宮癌，那我甘心挨他們的駡了。可惜他們不是這樣辦，他們不責某大醫院的延誤，而說到完全盡了義務的我，其心理實難以了解，大槪怕某大醫院是外國人罷。</p>
<p>中國人現在看待醫生，還是三敎九流的心理，尤其是地方上公立醫院的醫生，更是走馬郎中又加以公僕了。自命爲地方紳士們，呼之使來，斥之使去，要批評就批評，更不必問事實與是非，而醫生到了紳士之門，亦往往成績反而不良，這其中必有種種因果，曾記得漢和帝時的郭玉，醫貧賤厮養，盡其心力而療，醫貴人時或不愈，其言曰：「貴者處尊高以臨臣，臣懷怖懾以承之，其爲療也，有四難焉，自用意而不任人，一難也。」扁鵲也有六不治，驕恣不論於理，爲一不治。過了二千年後的中國，還是老樣罷了。這種實例，在現世上也不少，你無論如何精誠的對待他，眞實的告訴他，祗是他心境有不順，就遷怒到你身上了。譬如有花柳病的人，你爲他檢查小便，化騐血液，十足盡了義務，十分得了證據，告訴他是淋毒或梅毒，他就一怒而去了，世上的人，是喜歡糊裏糊塗被騙的。</p>
<h3 id="c197">新醫藥發達過程中幾個重要的發見和發明（八） <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 顧壽白</p>
<p>（五）臓器療法和分泌學說</p>
<p>在歐洲諸國丨尤其是瑞士和挪威，有許多的居民，喉的前面都腫得很大；這便是盾狀腺腫Ｒｏｉｔｒｅｏ以前並不知道盾狀腺有甚麽作用，到了一千八百八十三年，勒勿丁（Ｒｅｖｅｒｄｉｎ）氏纔注意到這腺和身體大有關係。有些病人，割去腫大的盾狀腺，就發生許多奇怪的症狀。最初覺得疲倦，後來漸覺加重，雖是極輕微的努力，也覺得疲困不堪，一切工作只好停止，這時完全變爲不活潑的狀態；同時寒冷的感覺漸漸增加起來，到了後來，體温居然降到常温以下，一面皮下組織漸漸爲膠狀液體所膨脹，使得形狀擁腫起來，面貌也都大變，因爲汗的减少，於是皮膚非常乾燥，同時精神作用也减了理解力也遲鈍了。呈這種症狀的疾病，稱爲黏液浮腫（Ｍｙｘａｅｄｅｍａ）。試看這種病人的盾狀腺，都是高度萎縮；所以盾狀腺被割去或自然萎縮了的時的候，便能引起這些病狀。這時候若用羊的盾狀腺的抽出物注射於這種病人的皮下，便可使這些症狀减退或消滅下去。</p>
<p>由上述的實事和其他許多的觀察，便可知道這盾狀腺能分泌一種物質，由血管運送於全身，對於肉體和精神兩方面都有很重要的作用。這便是盾狀腺顯然而内分泌作用的證據。</p>
<p>在歐洲有許多地方，無論有無盾狀腺腫的區域，那兒童的身體發育往往極度不良；這稱爲侏爲侏儒病（Ｃｒｅｔｏｎｅ）。這侏儒病的發生，有兩種不同的條件；一是併發盾狀腺腫，一是没有盾狀腺腫；後者又特别稱爲特發性侏儒病（ＳｐｒａｄｉｃＣｒｅｔｉｎｅ。這種病狀在没有盾狀腺腫的區域也可發生。</p>
<p>侏儒病的病人，或許年齡雖到了二十歲左右，那身長也不過和同一家族中比他小十二歲或十六歲的兒童相等，而精神發育的减退狀况也是如此。他們不能讀書，甚至連字母都不認識，並且言語也不發達，形狀擁腫笨拙。實際上這種病人是小規模的黏液浮腫者的代表。這些侏儒病的兒童，都没有盾狀腺；所以我們可以說這種形狀的侏儒病是由於先天的缺乏盾狀腺而起的。</p>
<p>假如這種解釋是正確的，那麽用盾狀腺的抽出液應該可以改善這些病童的狀態。若是這病人未曾經久不治，大約用適量的盾狀腺抽出物醫治以後，可以迅速成長，而精神作用方面大抵也可同樣發展。對於病人用盾狀腺劑愈早，這些有利的效果也愈顯著。</p>
<p>當最初想到用盾狀腺抽出物處置黏液浮腫的時候，以爲必須注射於皮下纔能秦效，後來知道只要將盾狀腺抽出物或是盾狀腺本身簡單地經口應用，也可得到同樣的效果。人類在進化早期的時候，盾狀腺曾經有管，可將分泌物注入喉腔，並且以前的人也早已知道將盾狀腺由口腔吞入，其效果很可以與皮下注射一樣；到了今日，這盾狀腺已是常由口腔内服，並且也早已證明對於黏液浮腫大有價値了。</p>
<p>盾狀腺的抽出物，對於别的疾病也可用得。例如對於某幾種皮膚病似乎都有一點的效果，而對於其他幾種病狀，也已證明這盾狀腺的抽出物是有用的了。</p>
<p>另一種内分泌的實例，就是所謂腎上腺。這是位於左右兩腎臓上端而不相連屬的小體。這器官若是有了病的變化，尤其病狀進行其深的時候，身體方面就要發生一種奇怪的現象，病人覺得十分衰弱，常有嘔吐和貧血。還有一種更顯著的現象，就是皮膚表而現出一種污穢的靑銅色；這種疾病稱爲愛迪生氏病</p>
<p>（Ａｄｄｉｓｏｎｓ　Ｄｉｓｅａｓｅ）。這些可厭的症在，與腎上腺的萎縮確有一種關係。現狀又知道這腎上腺的作用是由内分泌而起的，當初以爲與神經系統有關，自然是錯誤的了。</p>
<p>這腎上腺的抽出物，對於身體具有强力的作有，是無疑的。這物質稱爲腎上腺素（Ａｄｒｅｎａｌｉｎ），能使一切小血管强度收縮，所以對於預防小血管的出血很有用處。學者又曾證明這抽出物能收縮末梢血管以增進血壓，所以對於醫治血壓低降頗有效果。若是腎上腺的抽出物用量太大或是用時太久，可以引起嚴重的症狀；這也是値得醫家注意的一件事。</p>
<p>從來認爲原因不明的糖尿病，數年前也由美國托龍托（Ｔｏｒｏｎｔｏ）大學敎授班汀（Ｂａｎｔｉｎｇ）氏證明是因腠腺内郎氏島的内分泌障碍而起的。他創製了一種島素（Ｉｎｓｕｌｉｎ），用以治療這病的重症，十分秦效；這也是臓器療法的一個大發明。</p>
<p>（六）Ｘ源</p>
<p>西曆一千八百九十五年十二月德國的報紙上忽然登載了一種很驚人的消息，說是：右爾茲堡（Ｗｕｒｚｂｕｒｇ）大學敎授灓琴（Ｂｏｎｔｇｅｕ）氏發見了一種能透過物體的光綫；這就是今日所謂Ｘ　（Ｘｒａｙ）。現在試將發見的經過介紹一下。　　灓琴氏向來對於赫爾茲（Ｈｅｒｔｚ）和雷那（ａｎｅＬｒｄ）氏所研究的眞空管内的陰極線極有興味。在一千八百九十五年十一月八日，他曾將苦魯克（Ｃｒｏｏｋｅ）氏的眞空管用黑色厚紙遮蓋起來，通以電流，忽然於無意中看見放在旁邊椅上塗了錆化白金鋧的紙上現出一種奇怪的黑影。那影子很像是光綫作用的產物；可是眞空管被黑色厚紙嚴密包裹着，那光綫又從何而來呢？他繼續研究的結果，就斷定牠確定眞空管而來，並且又知道即使離開二米突的距離也還能發光。他起初以爲這是一種前人所未知的新奇的光，但是旣無不芒，又不能反射和屈折，只是一種新放射　罷了。後來他又仔細研究這　的性質，纔知道牠具有强大的透過力，不但能透過紙，布，木片等物，並且連人的手掌和金屬的薄箱也能透過。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c198">牀與棺 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 顏</p>
<p>牀與棺，都是睡眠的用具，不過一供短眠，一供長睡而已。世界的人，類多重視棺材而輕視臥榻，窮人繩牀竹榻，簡陋已極，然而一旦與世永别，其長眠之棺，縱極陋劣，而價値也終在繩牀竹榻之上。「富人一榻之費，雖至數十金或數百金，不過一朝永訣，棺廓之費，輒數千金，如用鋼棺玻璃棺，所費當更大了。不但普通人輕牀重棺，就是我們的孔聖人，也有這樣思想，看他賣掉自已的車子，爲顏回製廓，可以知之矣。</p>
<p>我推度人之輕牀重棺，必以爲生前有種種享樂，家居外出，到處有賞心樂意之事，惟死後則長眠不起，各種享樂，都與絕缘，只有給他一具好好的棺材，使他睡得稱心寫意些，其實這思想是大大地錯誤的。處今之世，最好能一切要抓住了現實，過去的不必追想，未來的也不必懸揣</p>
<p>，應抓住現實的快樂，不必懸揣未來的幸福。牀是現實的東西，所以應當考究些，如果手頭無錢，賣張好的牀，也當在將來的棺材費中提出十分之七八以挹注，而使現在短眠之牀，好於將來長眠之棺。</p>
<p>有人說：短眠是暫死，長眠是永死，同是死，同是死不復知，又何必厚於牀而薄於棺呢？我說：是知其一未知其二也。苟入了睡鄉，自然若死了不知矣。當登牀固未必卽入睡鄉，且也有不思入睡鄉者，午倦之一榻橫陳，以資休息；知已相逢，西窗剪燭之後，繼以抵足長</p>
<p>談，如果是精美之牀，其快樂爲何如？牀上更有人生問題中最大的工作，假使不是適體的牀，其爲美中不足又如何？此外牀臥治的人，可以在牀上治國平天下，還可以在牀上簽訂停戰恊定，要人們更在牀上發表政見。總之，牀之功用，豈僅供暫死之睡眠而已哉。至於永死，除非你的屍體像我們的國父有不配朽之資格，才値得装進好棺材。否則，三兩天遺骸腐化了，没有了，装以上好的棺材，試問値得嗎？所以我勸人生前之牀，務必盡力考究，死後之棺，要在臨死時叮囑兒孫務民必從儉。</p>
<h3 id="c199">燈下 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 定盦</p>
<p>鄉鎭在現今，已經是到了經融最枯竭的時候了，不要說關於奢靡的消耗，早在廢止之列；就是晚上借光的電燈，也大多給公司裏來剪線了，都改用煤油燈，上一些的，是點汽油燈，這已是占據少數，當那店主在晚上黯然的煤油燈下，的搭的搭撥動算盤，詳細的檢核當天的營業，結果是一聲長嘆，原因是：連本都來開銷還嫌不夠。</p>
<p>農人們，到現在社會這樣的文明，他們還是謹守古風，有時計的人家，可說是絕對没有，他們是：「日出而作，日入而息，」所以晚上點燈是很少的，就是要用，也以菜油盞或紅蠟燭爲多，有時村裏做武林班或羊皮戲，丨丨就是用紙剪的人，穿了線，映在羊皮紙框裏做的影戲丨丨也是點着冒着濃烟的煤油手盞或些的紅蠟。</p>
<p>我們的上海朋友，可說是享樂極了，雪亮的電燈，那個燈泡，還有光頭大小的分别，各種顏色的不同，磨砂和奶白，管形和圓形的種種，那外面的燈罩，更有許多的區别，一燈之微，浪費如此，把它和内地的人們比較，恐怕不止天堂與地獄之别呢！</p>
<p>在上海尋生活的人，也正自在嘆苦，每天上午Ｘ時至下午Ｘ時的辦公時間之内，長日和電燈作伴，你想屋子裏白日開電燈，差不多已成了一個極普遍的事實，說來是祗有覺得悲哀，一般靑年的雙目，天天在那電燈下，在不久以後，他的目力，一定要减弱，最低也得患着目疾。</p>
<p>燈光下找尋歡樂的人，當然也是很多，你看舞場的舞客，賭塲的賭客，酒店的酒客，旅館的旅客，他們陶醉在迷人燈光之下的漩渦中，不知自身是如何的需要，國家是如何的危急，却一心一意在取樂逍遙，我想他們如其有淸醒的時候，也當自省一番啊！</p>
<p>那凄凉黯淡的弄堂路燈之下，有失去靑春的歌女；街頭店家門燈之下，有榮華已去的壯男，這些，在不久以前，都是在那雪亮電燈之下風狂過了的，曾幾何時，燈光依舊，人事已非！燈啊燈啊！這是你的罪惡呢，還是一般人；「自作孽，不可活，」呢！</p>

<p>— 安夫</p>
<p>是朋友的好意罷？把我灌得幾乎醉了！在一個新秋的晚空上。</p>
<p>我帶着模糊的醉眼，踉蹌的脚步，獨自在靜寂的人行道上拖着影子搖擺着；從樹梢頭溜下來的輕颺，吻着我的臉，吻我的髮，眞温柔！像春風一般的温柔可人。好快呀！輕飄的脚步，已把我載到庽所了。</p>
<p>誰在我的房裏，燈光這樣亮？當我一走進臥室，方知不是燈光，而是從玻窗裏透進來的月光。我一面脫去外衣，換上睡衣；一面想，我今夜怎麽會這樣糊塗，喝得眞要醉了，還是早些睡吧！於是爬上床睡了。可是一睡到床上，就覺得神經跳動得格外快了；心裏似乎有件東西在爬動，口竟像在煎；睡不穩，只得再爬起來。吃過了茶，推開了窗兒，那鄰家後園的花草和樹木，敪射進我的眼簾了。雖然天天看慣了的東西，不會引起什麽特感來；可是在月光裏似乎要比在太陽裏淸幽得多，最嫵媚的，要算那月季花了，低着頭，彷彿在對我微笑。記得我故鄉的園子裏，也有花草，也有樹木，在風淸月白的夜裏，我也曾徘徊過，凝思過。而今，故鄉是離開我遠了，在月色朦朧的時候，我不覺勾起了悵惘的鄉思。</p>
<p>風，一陣凉於一陣的從人身上飛過，微微的凉意沁進了我的心田。莫着了凉的嬌呼聲是聽不見，代我披上外衣的人也不在；除了我自已之外，還有誰來調護我呢？我爲伊我應當添上一件外衣；於是隨手在衣架上取了一件較厚的衫子披上，依然倚着窗口，看着天上的月，聽着地下的蟲聲。</p>
<p>已將近二點鐘了罷？整個的都市，全在靜默中了；在樹枝𨻶處，有一角小樓，樓裏的電燈忽地亮了，薄薄的窗紗上，有一個倩影在缷着晚装，一件一件地卸；是誰家的女郎？</p>

<p>不料一分鐘兩分鐘的過去，十分十五分鐘的過去，依然不見這二人回來，桂枝坐在這裏不作事，趙自强更没有那種勇氣來說話。於是呼呼的咳嗽了兩聲，又吸了兩吸鼻子。不過這樣搭訕的工夫，佔着時間時都是很短的，聲音過去了，也許感到格外的無聊。桂枝看了他那樣子，想要笑，又不便笑出來。於是在身上抽下來手絹，輕輕的抹了一抹嘴。又抬起手來按了一按頭髮？就把臉向着門外邊道；幹嗎去了，怎麽一點消息没有？趙自强借了這個機會，就搭着腔道：他們都是會開玩笑的，也許就是這樣走了。桂枝低着頭，抬起眼皮來看了趙自强一下，並没有作聲。趙自强伸手到各衣袋裏去掏摸了一陣，掏出一盒烟捲來，又四處去張羅着火柴，擦了一根火柴，慢慢的點上。他剛是噴着一口烟，有了一句話，想要說出來，桂枝却手扶了桌子沿，突然站立起來，向趙处强正色說道：我要回去了。他說這句話的態度，那是很堅决的。然而他吐出來的聲音，却是非常的細，细得幾乎处自已都聽不出來了。可是趙自强這一下子很聰明，竟是聽出來了。就向桂枝點着頭道，還坐一會兒罷。也許他們還要來呢。桂枝道：他們是存心開玩笑，去了這樣久不見消息，那就會來了。趙自强也只好站立起來，便道：假使回府没有什麽事的話，又何妨再坐一會呢？他眼睛望着桂枝雖是很留神，但是他的臉却微微的偏着，不曾向桂枝對面看。桂枝微微的一笑，將牙咬了下嘴唇皮，又坐下來了。（一八三）</p>

<p>— 孺牛</p>
<p>當我在家鄉的村子裏看中國舊戲的時候，是還未被敎育成「讀書人」的時候，小朋友大抵是農民。愛看的是翻筋斗，跳老虎，一把烟燄，現出一個妖精來；對於劇情，似乎都不大和我們有關係。大面和老生的爭城奪地，小生和正旦的離合悲歡，全是他們的事，揑鋤頭柄人家的孩子，自已知道是决不會登壇拜將，或上京赴考的。但還記得有一齣給了感動的戲，好像是呌作「斬木誠」。一個大官蒙了不白之寃，非被殺不可了，他家裏有一個老家丁，面貌很相像，便代他去「伏法」。那悲壯的動作和歌聲，眞打動了看客的心，使他們發現了自已的好模範。因爲我的家鄉的農人，農忙一過，有些是給大户去帮忙的。爲要做得像，臨刑時候，主母照例的必須去「抱頭大哭」，然而被他踢開來了，雖在此時，名分也得嚴守，這是忠僕，義士，好人。</p>
<p>但到我在上海看電影的時候，却早是成爲「下等華人」的了，看樓上坐着白人和闊人，樓下排着中等和下等的「華胃」，銀幕上現出白色兵們打杖，白色老爺發財，白色小姐結婚，白色英雄探險，令看客佩服，羡慕，恐怖，自已覺得做不到。但當白色英雄探險非洲時，却常有黑色的忠僕給他開路，服役，拚命，替死，使主子安然的回家：待到他豫備第二次探險時，忠僕不可再得，便又記起了死者，臉色一沈，銀幕上就現出一個他記憶上的黑色的面貌。看客也大抵在微光中把臉色一沈：他們被感動了。</p>
<p>幸而國產電影也在掙扎起來，聳身一跳，上了高牆，舉手一揚，擲出飛劍，不過這也和十九路軍一同退出上海，現在是正在准備開映屠格納夫的「春潮」和矛盾的「春蠶」了。當然，這是進步的。但這時候，却先來了一部竭力宣傳的「猺山艷史」。</p>
<p>這片子，主題是「開化猺民」，關鍵是「招駙馬」，令人記起「四郎探母」以及雙陽公主追狄」這些戲本來。中國的精神文明主宰全世界的偉論，近來不大聽到了，要想去開化，自然只好退到苗猺之類的裏面去，而要成這種大事業，却首先須「結親」，黃帝子孫，也和黑人一樣，不能和歐亞大國的公主結親，所以精神文明就無法傳播。這是大家可以由此明白的。</p>

<p>索原先生一連發表了兩篇文章，我纔抽暇回</p>
<p>覆了一次，第一篇他所提出的兩點，我已依次回答，第二篇故意咬文嚼字，吹毛求疵，我也給他解釋了一番，而今天（七日）看見索原先生又來了，却說我「並未答復」而是與他「胡纒」，其實單在自由談一個刋物上，先生們一連來了四篇，我才答了一篇，若說到「胡纏」，我實在不敢奉陪。至於說到眞有主張要我答復的話，我是願意加入討論的。所以這次我讀了適之和索原兩位先生的文筆以後，雖領會了一點「胡纏」二字的意義，而覺得態度上欠君子風，但我也並不以子之矛，攻子之盾，就拿這二字來作題目，上面這個標題正足以表示我全是出於學術的討論，而不含絲毫惡意的。</p>
<p>索原先生說我承認了兩點，卽（一）基本英語並非國際語，（二）二者各有短長，各有園地。但第一點我並未承認，奥格登創此‘目的全在作國際語用，不過我們現在頂有用於它的是在其簡易的一點。至於宅能收國際通用之效，那更是一舉兩得了。基本英語爲什麽可作國際語用呢？因爲歐美各國，英語是可以通行的，甚至日本都可以，我的一個朋友在大震的頭一年去游歷日本就全是用的英語。說到中國呢？上海姑作爲例外，就是内地如果你病了進醫院去，天熱時想水喝，隨便你呌多少聲“Ａｋｖｏ”不見得有人送水來吧，呌到最後，看護聽得不耐煩走來干涉，你若說她不應面帶怒容（“Ｋｏｌｅｒａ”），她也許要聽爲你是得了虎列拉，而打你幾針鹽水呢。只要你學會了基本英語的“Ｗａｔｅｒ”一字，就不至吃這種苦頭了。東西洋都能通用，還不算國際語嗎？</p>
<p>我學愛斯怕難讀（Ｅｓｐｅｒａｎｔｏ）是在十二年前，它與基本英語之不同，我深知道，所以我說各有短長，各有園地。基本英語的内容，已有許多書及張先生的文章論及，此地限於篇幅不提，且說「愛斯怕難讀」的短長與園地好了。它的長處是在文法極簡單，變化有規則，短處是爲時尙早，用途不廣，卽將文與言混爲一談，也嫌太没有書給我們讀了。說到園地呢，恐怕目下只能如索原先生說的，拿到在莫斯科舉行的萬國工人運動會上，去喊口令罷。俄國因爲俄文太難，不能强人學好，所以便利用「愛斯怕難讀」，以與世界各國的普羅階級通聲氣。於是乎「莫斯科印象記」「新俄游記」也都由它做出來了。</p>
<p>以上兩點索原先生說他是同意的，下面再說他未能同意的五點，（一）企圖作爲國際語的基本英語，我已答復如下。至於企圖作爲英語合理化方案的基本英語，也就是他下列的三四兩項現在我分别再詳復如下：關於拚法的合理化，我已說過連Ａｎｇｌｉｏ都失敗了，所以奥格登改弦易轍去從别的方面下手。駕輕就熟，誰都知道是好的，基本英語也就不去另造新字，與其去新找一部分人來學會“Ｒｉｔ”一字，不如保留現有的五萬萬人已知的“Ｒｉｇｈｔ”一字，這正是合理的辦法。習慣成自然，自然是最合理的。外國人吃麵包，中國人吃飯，你能說誰是不合理的嗎？所以“Ｒ‘ｈｔ”這種拚法，是合理的，因爲它是從一六一０年經過“Ｒｉｈｔ”種種變化而演進出來的。若改成“Ｒｉｔ”例不合理了。至於不規則動詞各名詞少數的例外，雖說不能完全合乎人造語的道理，但它也自有其道理的。有的是因爲發音的關係而來的，總之我們只要去查查ＯＥ，ＭＥ，ＭｌｎＥ發展之跡，便可明白。　　（二）索原先生說，基本英語不能離普通英語而獨立，不能代替普通英語，這個我也不能同意，因爲你學會了基本英語，你就可以說話，寫信，作文，各種用途都行，爲什麽還不能獨立呢。卽論後者我們旣可以用基本英語譯出普通英語的書本來，用它說出普通英語的話來，爲什麽還不能代替呢？末了（五）無論環境如何要人臣服，在心而不在言語，日本雖强朝鮮人學了日語，但朝鮮人並不因此而心服，反之，俄國人不用他們的國語而利用「愛斯怕難讀」也能收到不少的順民呢。</p>

<p>— 游光</p>
<p>春夢是顚顚倒倒的。「夏夜夢」呢？看沙士比亞的劇本，也還是顚顚倒倒。中國的秋夢，照例却應該「肅殺」，民國以前的死囚，就都是「秋後處决」的，這是順天時。天敎人這麽着，人不能不這麽着。所謂「文人」當然也不至於例外，喫得飽飽的睡在牀上，食物不能消化完，就做夢，而現在又是秋天，天就敎他的夢威嚴起來了。</p>
<p>二卷三十一期（八月十二日出版）的「濤聲」上，有一封自名「林丁」先生的給編者的信，其中有一段說丨</p>
<p>「···之爭，孰是孰非，殊非外人所能詳道。然而彼此摧殘，則在傍觀人看來，却不能不承是整個文壇的不幸。······我以爲各人均應先打屁股百下，以儆效尤，餘事可一槪不提。···」</p>
<p>前兩天，還有某小報上的不署名的社談，牠對於早些日子余趙的剪竊問題之爭，也非常氣憤丨</p>
<p>「···假使我一朝大權在握，我一定把這段東西捉了來，判他們罰作苦工，讀書十年；中國文壇，或尙有乾凈之一日。」</p>
<p>張獻忠自已要没落了，他的行動就不問「孰是孰非」，只是殺。淸朝的官員，對於原被兩造，不問淸紅皂白，各打屁股一百或五十的事，確也偶爾會有的，這是因爲满洲還想要奴才，供搜刮，這就是「林丁」先生的舊夢。某小報上的無名子先生可還要比較的文明，至少，牠是已經知道了上海工部局「判罰」下等華人的方法的了。</p>
<p>但第一個問題是在怎樣才能夠「一朝大權在握」？文弱書生死樣活氣，怎麽做得到權臣？先前還可以希望招駙馬，一下子就飛黃騰達，現在皇帝没有了，即使满臉塗着雪花膏，也永遠遇不到公主的靑睞；至多，只可以希圖做一個富家的姑爺而已，而捐官的辦法，又早經取消，對於「大權」，還是只能像狐狸的遇着高處的葡萄一樣，仰着白鼻子看看。文壇的完整和乾凈，恐怕實在也到底很渺茫。</p>
<p>五四時候，曾經在出版界上發現了「文丐」，接着，又發現了「文氓」，但這種威風凛凛的人物，却是我今年秋天在上海新發現的，無以名之，姑且稱爲「文官」罷。看文學史，文壇是常會有完整而乾凈的時候，但誰曾見過這文壇的澄淸，會和這類的「文言」們有絲毫關係的呢。</p>
<p>不過，夢是總可做的，好在没有什麽關係，而寫出來也有趣。請安息罷，候補的少大人們！</p>

<p>— 厚培</p>
<p>民國二十二年上半期之對外貿易，海關統計册，已有按月數字之發表。在此過去六個月中，吾人撫今追昔，實有不能不抱悲觀者。雖世界經濟之凋敝，已爲各國普遍現象，中國當亦不能逃出例外，然而在比例上，吾國貿易，實爲每况愈下之趨勢。近兩年來，銀價低落，對於出口貿易之促進，確爲一最佳機會，同時國人對於國貨提倡亦不遺餘力，自應爲相當之進步，然而工商疲敝，百業凋零，出口貿易愈趨不振。此種情形，實爲我國國民經濟衰敗象徵充分的表現，吾人固無庸爲諱者也。</p>
<p>本年前半年貿易總額，出口値二萬九千六百四十六萬餘元，入口値三萬元九千六百０七萬餘金單位，折合國幣七萬七千一百十萬餘元，總計値十萬萬０六千七百五十七萬餘元。上年（一九三二）前半期對外貿易，出口爲二萬元九千八百九十萬闊兩，折合國幣四萬六千五百七十二萬元，入口五萬二千九百０五萬金單位，折合國幣九萬四千五百八十七萬九千元，總計値十四萬萬一千一百五十九萬九千餘元。兩年比較，本年貿易，出口入口，均有下減，出口減低一萬六千九百二十五萬四千零十五元，入口減低一萬七千四百七十七萬０九百十五元，總計減低三萬四千四百０二萬四千九百三十元。換言之，卽出口減落百分之三六·三四，入口減落百分之一八·四八，總計減落百分之二四·三八，據國際貿易局之貿易統計報告，本年前六個月與上年同月比較，六個月間，出口最高不過等於上年同月百分之八三·三三，（一月份）最低僅等於上年同月份百分之四八·００·（四月份）入口最高超過上年同月百分之一八·六六，（僅有二月份）最低則僅等於上年同月百分之六二·九九，（一月份）總計最高不過超過上年同月百分之二，最低則僅等於上年百分之六六·三四，其與上年相差之程度，顯而易見，有謂本年貿易統計，以東北各關報告之不全，不能與上年等量齊觀者。苟東北各關計入，其貿易數字，或且較本年爲高。吾人試再就併入東北各關一比較之。查上年前六個月，東北各關數字，出口値一九八，四五０，五０四元。，入口値一一三，六０五，九九三元，總計値三一二，０五六，四九七元。若假定本年貿易内，東北各關之報告數字，仍與上年不相上下，併入上年數字計算，則本年前六個月貿易，出口應爲四九四，九一七，０二三元，入口應爲八八四，七一四，０七八元，總計應爲一，三七九，六三一，一０一元。以此數與上半年比較，出口較增二千九百十九萬六千元，入口減低六千一百十六萬四千九百餘元，總計減低三千一百九十六萬八千餘元，仍較上年低落百分之二二七，是本年貿易之不及上年，又至爲明顯。且南部各關，上年以來貿易之增加，與東北各關之被刼，有相當影響，其影響程度如何，雖不能確定，然以東北各關數字相加，似不能謂爲過低，此又吾人所應注意者也。</p>
<p>在併入東北各關計算之數字中，出口貿易，較上年應增高二千九百萬元，情形較上年爲進步。但依據本年實際數字，則出口減低百分之三十六，較入口爲甚，其原因，乃由於東北各關内，出口數量之多，大荳一項，卽居吾國出口中之大宗，東北各關被刼，大荳貿易，已等於零，以前占出口總値百分之十五以上者，現僅占百分之０·七三，本年出口貿易中，以此當受重大影響，此併入東北各關數字之所以超出上年也。茲試就除出東北各關之數字再一比較，上年前六個月除出東北各關，出口應爲二萬六千七百二十七萬元，入口應爲八萬三千二百二十七萬三千元，總計應爲十萬萬０九千九百五十四萬三千元。今年上期與上年同期比較，出口應增加百分之一０·九二，入口減少百分之七·三五，總計減少百分之二·九七，此點亦這以表現從比例上推測，出口貿易之進步，實較優於入口貿易，亦足强差人意耳。</p>
<p>本年前半年入超數，爲四萬七千四百六十四萬一千五百六十六年，上年爲三萬萬零八百十八萬九千闊兩，折合四萬八千零十五萬八千四百六十七元。本年之數，略低五百五十一萬七千餘元。但入超之百分比，即較上年爲高。本年前半年入超，占入口總値百分之六一·五五,上年則占百分之五０·七六，足以證明本年入超比例之高。唯吾人亦應注意東北各關數字，不在本年報告範圍以内，設加入東北各關數字在内，本年入超，應占入口總額百分之四四·０六，實較上年入超比例爲低。若除出東北各關不計，則上年前半期之入超，應爲五萬六千五百萬元，占入口數値百分之六七·八九，其入超程度之高，應超出本年，亦至爲明顯。吾人自此種情形觀察，本年入超問題之嚴重。似不超過於上年，其情形亦與出口貿易相同。</p>
<p>本年入超額若干，尙難懸測，若自上年各季之增减比例推測之，第三季較第二季减少百分之三二·九五，第四季較第三季减少百分之四·四八，苟本年下半年無特殊變動，其貿易變態，與上年大致相同，則本年全年入超推測，或將爲八萬二千八百七十餘萬元，或等於五萬三千一百九十三萬餘關兩之數，較上年入超之五五六，六０五，二四０關兩略低。唯此係在東北各關出口數字慘落情形之下。但本年下期貿易，吾人所應注意者，則爲棉麥借欵之五千萬美金。棉麥兩項入口，當有大量增加。雖不致全部輸入，入超之數，或將達九萬萬元，亦未可知。</p>
<p>在我國對外貿易中，日本各向占第一位。自上年起，美國已躙居第一位，由百分之一八·八五，（二十年）增至百分之二一·一六，（與貿易總値百分比）日本則由二三·九三，（二十年）减至百分之一六·四五，本年上半期，美國仍居第一位，日本居第二位，然百分比，已均有减低。美國占百分之一九·八五，（上年同期爲二０·九四）日本占百分之一０·九一。（上年同期爲一八·二０）兩國對華貿易，變遷均巨，與上年同期比較，美國方面，出口比率增加幾及一倍，入口則由百分之二六·五一，减至二０·三七，日本方面，出口比率，由百分之二五·五０，减至一五·一一，入口由一四·五八，减至九·三一，其他各國，如澳洲，比率由上年同期百分之三·０四，增至七·五五，俄國由百分之二·九九·减至一·六三，其中出口由百分之七·六二减至一·一二，入口由０·七五增至一·八三，出口之减低，當由於東北問題之影響。僅英國始終保持原狀，幾無增减。根據本年貿易趨勢，美國之居第一位，已　毫無疑義，更加以棉麥借欵，入口比例，當更有增加。日本貿易卽令不致退居第三位，比例與英國當亦相差不遠。不致有以前之高比率。唯此非日本之損失乃由東北各關之被刦。俄國則由出超轉爲入超，已有統計上之事實證明。將來華貨出口，卽令略有增加，其比率亦遠不及俄貨入口之速，自可斷言也。</p>
<p>近年以來，我國對外貿易，原有逐年上增之現象，民國二十年，已達歷年來之最高數，値二十三萬萬四千餘關兩。上年以一二八及熱河事件之發生，及東北海關報告之不全，慘落至十五萬萬四千一百八十餘萬關兩。本年上期貿易，以東北海關之報告缺乏，已較上年同期减少三萬四千四百萬元，下期卽令略有增加，合計恐亦難超出二十二萬萬元之數，合關平十四萬萬一千二百餘關兩。較上年仍减少，當在一萬二千九百八十萬關兩以上，恐爲近十七年來之最低數。入超方面，以東北大宗出口之損失，或將達九萬萬元之巨數，不僅爲歷年最高數，其與上年比例，亦且超出甚多。上年貿易總額十五萬萬關兩中，入超額占去百分之三十五，本年則恐將占貿易總額中百分之四十以上。在此千鈞一髮之時，國人若不速圖補救，海外市塲，恐無復吾國商品之立足地矣。</p>
<h3 id="c209">各國排斥日貨與日之防禦戰 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 宗藩</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>自從九一八東北的慘變發生以後，日本帝國主義猙獰的面目，已揭示於世界；而我國抵制日貨運動，比較上也已具體化與普遍化，日本商品的銷路，曾遭極度的打擊，日本的輸出貿易上，也自然受了不少的影響，因此，名項工業經營的困難，失業者的激增；同時展開其金融及財政方面的恐慌。而日本　貨的國際價値的慘落，與正貨的海外的逃避，也成了必然的結果。於是日本在一九三一年十二月，卽斷行金輸出的再禁止。卽以通貨膨脹的政策，爲應付這恐慌的對策。利用對外滙兌的低落，使日本貨在海外市場價格一致暴落，並用傾銷政策，以開拓海外的新市場。因此近的如印度南洋南非，遠至地中海以及南美洲各地，舊市塲的確定，與新市場的展開的方略，頓告成功。就中，在英國殖民地的日本的傾銷政策，更蠶食了不少英國品的市場。</p>
<p>這樣，必然地惹起英國商品對日本商品激烈的競爭。這競爭便成了英國對日本的抵貨運動，更進而從經濟的鬥爭而爲政治的鬥爭。　　英國對日本抵貨運動的第一戰，在一九三二年七八月間的渥太華會議尙未終了時，印度的改正棉織品關稅爲其序幕。當時印度改止的棉織品關稅，對英國製品爲二成五，而其他各外國品則爲五成。以前英國品與其他各國製品的關稅額相差僅爲一成一分二釐，今則一舉而有二成五分之差了。其第二戰，是一九三三年四月十日的印日通商條約的廢棄。接着是四月十二日印度實業保護法的制定；六月六日更依據這法令對於英七國以外的棉織品關稅，提高到七成五分，這完全是禁止輸入的最高關稅了。不但印并如此，在埃及於一九三三年五月，英國以外的棉紗棉布亦均是提高關稅；六月十五日馬來半島棉布輸入實行關稅增加對英國品爲一成，對日本品極上者爲三成，下等品達七八成。同月二十六日東菲洲的英屬關耶地方，棉織品及人造絲織品，增加關稅達二成至五成。同月三十一日堀威爾州政府，對於英國以外的棉織品，像皮鞋，煉乳，罐頭，及其他的食糧品等，均設有關稅，而獨於英國製品則一槪無稅。東非洲也對於日本品與原價最高的英國棉織品，爲同樣的課稅。七月三日紐西蘭商人作日本商品防止運動請願，西非洲且廢止以前的通商條約。從上面所表現的事實，可知英國對日本商品排斥抵制，如火燎原，一刻不停地在擴大和進行着。</p>
<p>從英國在印度增築關稅壁壘的動機起，延伸到全殖民地對日貨作徹底的排斥運動，這是對於日本經濟的外遭，敷了一層又周密又有系統的防遏與窒息的計畫。英國對日本的抵貨運動，旣有了這樣具體的步驟，則英日兩國的經濟的鬥爭，不但各個作積極的動員，實際上，經濟的全個部面，已在用着短兵和砲火作猛烈的戰爭了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>所謂英日間的經濟上的鬥爭，换句话說，其實不過是老大的英帝國對於日本品活動的一種自衛手段。這樣說來日本商品的在海外市場的活躍，一定具有堅强的力量。要解答這一問題，最好把英國實業聯合會特别調查委員會的「對於英日實業競爭調查報告書」的内容，引用一下：</p>
<p>「（一）今後二十年至三十年間，日本人口的增加，大約可達千五百萬至三千萬之巨，而其國内的資源，祗能贍養其一部分的人口。從而日本商品的到海外來競爭，這是不可避免而無可疑義的事實。</p>
<p>（二）現在歐美各國的關稅壁壘，日益加高，而日本，所輸出的商品，已漸次擴展其範圍，因此日本祇須一有機會，便須與國際間的各種製造品起激烈的競爭。</p>
<p>（三）日本爲便於與各國競爭起見，不措利用種種手段。在過去一年中，意識地利用日金的下落，亂暴地開始國家的販賣政策，以威脅世界各地市場。受其災害者，首先是英國，而其他的貿易國家，也無一不受其影響。　　（四）勞賃，勞動條件，及生活水準等的　不同。勞賃之生活費的主要部分，商品方面，東方與西方，在同一的條件下，是無法競爭的。舉一個適當的例罷：日本的人造絲工業的輸出，在過去的六年間，增進到九倍之多。而英國的輸出，同一期間中，反减少了三分之二。</p>
<p>（五）英國的製造業者，所受到的日本攻擊的影響，不單是人造絲與粗製的棉織品工業，甚至如重化學工業品，電燈泡，脚踏車，紐扣，水門汀，橡皮鞋等等，亦無不受其影響。</p>
<p>（六）日本商品的所以能夠驅逐英國品的原因：第一而且是最大的原因，爲勞賃，勞動時間及勞動條件等，這因爲東方的生活水準極低；第二個原因，則由於匯兌的低落，政府輸出補助金及運賃傾銷法等的實施。這是日本輸出業者所享受的「不公正」的利益。</p>
<p>（七）英本國及各屬地市塲中，如果不去防護爲英國謀利益的共同動作或方案；如果一任日本商品的競爭不去設法加以抵禦，而聽其繼續存在，則英國的工業保護政策，以及渥太華會議所决定的方案就等於零了。</p>
<p>又實業聯合會特别調查委員會，在上述的報告書之後，對於日本的勞動條件，更有如下的批評，現摘其大要如下，</p>
<p>（一）日本商品競爭的背後，有多產的大衆低賃銀的勞動羣。至少其生活水準較之西歐的勞動條件要低三分之一；而且低廉的勞賃與勞動條件之外，日本的輸出，更由國家用人工的保護，設置特種關稅，補助金，及利潤等的國家保證的方法。</p>
<p>（二）日本的某種商品，在工塲成立後的最初四年中，得免除所得稅。又歸通商局所管轄的在國外的貿易專員的活動，也是最可注意的事。</p>
<p>（三）日本對於外洋輪船的補助費，除一九一五丨一八年及一九二零年以時勢較　者外，由日本政府對於外洋輪船公司鉅額的補助金的給予，乃得免各項的損害者，爲數極多。</p>
<p>（四）日本今後必繼續地巧妙地利用其滙兌市塲的價格，以帮助其貿易的發展，這是可以預想的事。</p>
<p>（五）日本因女子人口的過剩，棉織工業極受其惠，而男工的賃銀，不過占英國賃銀率的三分之一，至於女子的賃銀率，則不過四分之一。</p>
<p>（六）其他日本工業中，還不脫家庭工業的領域者不少，如瓷器工業便是件可注目的事。據英國製造業者的報告，日本品如在英帝國各市場販賣，則其價格，無一不在英國工業製品的半數以下。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>英日兩國的經濟鬥爭的主幹，我們讀了上述的報告，已極明顯；但英國對日本的鬥爭的策略，還有更進一步的辦法，以下是賽米愛，哈努利氏在英國下院的演說；</p>
<p>「日本商品的競爭，决不僅是普通商業上的競爭。這是以經濟侵略的信條，來攻擊外國的市場，故集中了一切的手段，以達成他們的目的。所以故意强行通貨膨脹，以及侵害他國的商標權等等惡毒的政策。日本是想獨攬東方的霸權，並且還想執世界市場的牛耳咧！我們的第一步對付方法，是英本國與自治領間的締結互惠恊定；其次與殖民地市塲有關係的法國，比利時，意大利等各國，締結互惠的關稅恊定。更應該利用時機，决定英國對外政策的新的方向；同時與美國不能不有再進一層的親密的提携。我熱切地希望政府採取一貫的方法，以處理當前的問題，並對於日本的斷片的解决方針，努力地而且斷然地與之作正面的鬥爭」　　英國對日本的抵制運動，天天的尖銳化與漸漸的具體化，我們於這演說中也可看出了。而自英國的經濟國家主義集團形成以後，更爲有組織的進展，對日經濟鬥爭，也已到達了最後的階段了。</p>
<p>本來，英國的經濟國家主義集團的形成，是上面已說過的：是一九三三年七年月間的渥太華會議所决定的事實。他的要旨：爲在英帝國内則採取自由貿易，對於國外者則採取保護貿易。换句話說：就是英本國，自治領土及各殖民地閒的組成一體，一面則高築關稅壁壘，使英國領土以外的外國品，不能越其雷池一步。爲確定並完成這方針起見，凡澳洲，南非洲，印度等地，均先後實行了這項政策，上面所說過的關稅率的提高以及廢棄與日本所訂的通商條約，就是實行這集團經濟的結果。</p>
<p>英國集團的國家主義經濟的實行，也就直接對於日本商品的海外侵略的致命傷。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>自英國國家主義經濟集團的策略實行以後，歐美各國的經濟集團，也都先後形成；而現在已變爲世界流行的方略了。這裏來介紹這經濟集團的趨勢。</p>
<p>葡萄牙從一九三三年六月一日，舉行殖民地會議起，七月十日改正統一殖民地爲目的的法令，一面改正本國與殖民地間的特惠關稅，一面爲擴充各殖民地的保護關稅起見，設立殖民地關稅委員會，决定殖民地對其本國間航海方面的保護及其必要的設施。</p>
<p>立沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，愛沙尼亞三小國，舉行集團經濟的會議，對於關稅及通貨政策，已成立了恊定。</p>
<p>比利時，意大利，荷蘭，瑞士等維持金本位的國家，已作成了金本位的集團經濟，法國的國務總理於七月九日的演說詞中，也明顯地表示法國經濟集團已有了相當的計劃。</p>
<p>美國於七月七日，通告脫離了一九二七年國際聯盟所定的「關於輸出入禁止並限制的撤廢條約」；同月十二日，先後會見阿根廷，巴西，哥崙比亞，智利等南美各國和代表，對於通商關係，上作更密切的商議進並而爲恊定的交涉。同時並表示絲綢及其他有關的物品的關稅，可以準備提高的意見。</p>
<p>德國在最近，也感到日本商品不但侵入到他們自已的國内，而且把他們的在别處的經濟地盤，日被蠶食，於最近也已在和歐美各國恊力地預備要和日本商品作有效的應付。</p>
<p>照上面隨便所列舉的事實來看，世界各國在各個形式上，都已在急劇地形成經濟集團的工作了。這現象的發生，在一方面固然由於這次世界經濟會議的失敗以後，必然地使經濟的國家主義的强硬化；但在另一方面，也不能不說是由於日本帝國主義的商品，在海外市場的過於活躍的一種防衛運動。所以今後的日本商品，不但是受英國的猛烈的抵制運動，制其正面的死命；就是世界各國，也必取包圍攻擊的抵禦運動，使日本商品不能再在各國有關係的所在去活動，這是必然的趨勢，所以世界各國的經濟集團化，經濟的國家主義强硬化以後，日本所受的打擊，當然可以預料的。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>日本對於世界各國的抵制日貨運動，用如何防禦的策略呢！自然目下最大的勁敵是英國，所以最初便用政治的手腕，對英國已樹立了第一幕的對抗戰了。</p>
<p>這第一幕的戰爭，就是對於印度的廢棄通商條約及提高關稅的問題。廢約的當時，一面提出强硬的抗議，並由住外各公使及領事，用盡種種方法，作直接間接的交涉。一面由紗廠商約定，决定不買賣印度的棉花，對英國及印度作報復的手段。最近印日當局雖然正預備舉行什麽的恊議會，但這是可以料想的事，在英</p>
<p>日雙方正在作經濟的對抗戰爭時，這一部分的恊議，决没有緩和的可能。</p>
<p>但是日本旣受了英國經濟集團及各國經濟集團的打擊，將取怎樣的總防禦手段呢？自然没有别的方向，必然地向他們正在呼喊的所謂日满經濟集團，或東亞經濟集團的路綫而邁進。東北幾省，已在日本帝國主義的鐡腕之下，利用了中國傀儡，正在盡量地發展他們所可用以爲活動的一切資料以及一切榨取的方式。而中國的這一塊肥肉，也當然在日帝國主義的耽耽虎視之下，必欲得之而甘心，同時其他的帝國主義者，也正在積極地預備着做一個爭奪的目標。</p>
<p>不過，專就所謂日满經濟集團而言，如果依照了日本的預定而進展，其實也正與各國的經濟集團另重其正面的衝奪，不但英日的經濟鬥爭，便是對世界的經濟鬥爭，也必然地更深刻更嚴重化了。</p>
<h3 id="c210">中國的國外貿易與國内貿易 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 法</p>
<p>這次中國經濟學社年會中，有人提出中國國際貿易與國内貿易問題，以爲國外貿易發展無望，還不如改進國内貿易爲宜，在美國羅斯福的復興美國實業計劃中的重要部份，也是在保護並開發其本國的國内市塲。這是個値得討論的問題，尤其在國際資本主義正努力於開倒車的時候。</p>
<p>本來，國外貿易和國内貿易並不是對立的名詞，而是相關聯的經濟發展的結果。在原始，並没有所謂貿易，隨後分工發生於家族之間，進而至於一氏族一民族，彼此間才發生了交換關係；直到國家形式，便發生了國内貿易。十八世紀資本主義發展的結果，引起各國國外市塲的競爭，不但生產的國際分工成爲各國資本主義的必要條件，而且國外市塲且成爲各資本主義國家的生命線，所以，國際貿易祗是隨經濟發展而來的國内貿易的沿進或擴大。</p>
<p>國際貿易之成爲資本主義國家之生命線的緣故，是因爲工業的發達，工業發達的國家一方面需要推銷其工業品，而他方面又需獲得原料，卽非被發展國際貿易不可，因此，和别國發生國際貿易關係的國家，可以分爲兩大類，一種是工業國家，其國際貿易是主動的，也可說是侵略者，别一種是產業落後的農業國家，其加入國際貿易的漩渦，是被逼的，也可說是被侵略的。</p>
<p>中國之和别國發生國際貿易關係，不幸正屬於後一類的國家。中國閉關自守的壁壘，起先是給英國的搶砲所打開，在各國經濟勢力侵入之初，中國政府及人民曾有過頑强的抵抗，但終於在國際貿易的湍流中同化。自然，在國際貿易中，中國所盡的任務，不過是「消納工業製就品，供給原料農業品，」在這種「不等價」的交易中，中國是受盡了列强的剝削。</p>
<p>但現在，情形起了變化，國際市塲愈來愈狹，各國關稅戰爭激化，康特立夫且以爲世界貿易正在「消滅」。在第二次大戰没有終結，第二</p>
<p>次世界市塲没有分割淸楚之前，很顯然的，中國雖想增進「消納製就品，供給原料品」的義務，也有所不能了。</p>
<p>現在，各國在没有發展國外市塲機會的時候，羣起保護自已的國内市塲。中國的情形和各國不同的地方有二點，而這二個特點使中國保護與發展中國國内市塲爲更必需與有利。</p>
<p>第一，中國主要的還是農業國，並没有非求國外市塲不可的工業品，對於國際貿易的需要，重要性自然較少。</p>
<p>第二，中國是一個巨大的「入超國」，如能保護國内市塲，排除外貨傾銷，這巨大的「入超」數量，很夠國内工業發展的市塲。</p>
<p>所以，如能排除外力的侵略，中國的國内貿易較國外貿易實爲重要。</p>
<p>但是，保護及開發國内市塲也是要有辦法的。現在，東北四省的「處女地」，向被同爲發展中國工業的大好市塲，是在日人鐡蹄下了。報載，雲南也岌岌可危，難免爲東北之續。中部重要商埠的靑島，也有可怕的謠言，在作爲立國三要素之一的土地尙不能保障的情形下，欲保護國内市塲，亦云難矣。</p>

<p>有人說：「中國是非亡不可」。也有人說：「中國不亡，是無天理」。雖然所說的字眼有些不同，而其預言中國必亡則一。那些「預言家」說中國必亡的理由：不外是中國人的習性丨也可說是劣根性丨有點自私自利，爭先恐後，個人主義，遇事不能從大處着想，眼光短淺等等。他們丨那些「預言家」看了這種現象，差不多是普遍的現象，因此覺得悲觀而大聲慨歎起來了於悲觀慨嘆之餘，並且還「同化」起來，走上自私自利，爭先恐後，個人主義···之路！而深深地感到老大中國的不可救藥。</p>
<p>的確，中國人是有一點兒自私自利···的。在火車站，有電車站，或者在郵政局，在銀行，以及各種的公共塲所，誰不想第一個買好票跑上車去，誰不想第一個就把自已的事辦好；即使在電影院裏或者竟在一個學校没有規定坐位的敎室裏，誰不是「爭先恐後」的跑進去想佔據一個最優等的位置。貪圖了個人的舒服，當然不能再顧及别人的便利，而我們的「預言家」在這種情形之下，也意識到過於「傻」了不是辦法，所以聰明地本能地勇敢地同樣的「自私」起來。他們「同化」的理由是「人家多是這樣，我又何苦做傻子」：而同時還要慨歎着「人心不古」以表明自已本來並不要「這樣」，不過是「學步」而已。</p>
<p>然而中國人的劣根性正不止此呢：東北四省的版圖易了顏色，在上海的人們，依舊是酣歌宴舞，金迷紙醉，似乎没有這回事的。砲聲驚醒不了發財的迷夢，熱血興奮不了麻醉的心靈！到現在還有好多人在做着發五十萬元大財的夢！我們的「預言家」眞的要不幸而言中了！</p>
<p>中國眞會亡嗎？基於「自私」的組織之下，中國眞會亡去的。</p>
<p>怎樣才能「不自私」呢？那惟有從自已做起，假使要等到别人不自私時然後自已才不自私，那是一輩子也不會如願。惟有每個人都能［袪除「自私」的觀念，那便什麽都不成問題。也不需要唱奮鬥，犠牲等高調了。然而也許有所謂「聰明人］在笑，笑你們都是「傻子」，不過，在這年頭兒，需要的正是「傻子」；傻透頂的傻子，才能掮起巨大的責任。「聰明人」是祗有予以「充軍」的處分。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation at Dushikou: Fang and Ji's Forces Now Surrounded <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Qin Dechun Passes Through, Over Zhihan, Pang Bingxun, and Others Arrive in Beiping Together with Song</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Qin Dechun, Over Zhihan, and about twenty staff members including Wei Lantian, left Chahar at 7:30 this morning for Beiping. They are expected to arrive at 6:00 PM. During Song's absence, Yang Zhennan will temporarily act as the provincial administrator. Song's mission is to report to He on the handling of the aftermath in eastern Chahar and to seek instructions regarding his nominal position after leaving the military. He is expected to stay in Beiping for three or four days before returning to Chahar. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan, leading Tai Dechun, Over Zhihanmen, Zhi Zhong, Wei Lantian, Zhang Jiyong, Xuan Jieshi, and accompanying guards, departed from Zhangjiakou by train at 8:00 AM this morning. They passed through Xuanhua at 10:00 AM. Pang took the train with them and will arrive in Beiping at 6:30 PM tonight. Song stated that after his previous return to Chahar, he went to northern Chahar to handle all the aftermath. After arriving in Zhangbei, he further inspected areas such as Daqinggou, Ertaizi, Mantouyingzi, and Shangdu. He originally intended to go to Kangbao and Baochang, but the rain prevented him. Fang was originally in the Dushikou area, and Ji also reached Dushikou a few days ago. Fang and Ji held a meeting there. Fang's attitude has slightly softened. A few days ago, he also sent his secretary-general, Fu Zichuan, to Zhang. Although I did not meet with him, I heard that he conveyed the following to him: Fang himself is unwilling to let go of the military and believes that three things should be considered: first, whether it benefits the people; second, whether it benefits the country; and third, whether it benefits the soldiers. If Fang does not leave, the people will not be at peace, the country will have no peaceful days, and even his own troops will lack food and clothing. What is the benefit of prolonging his stay? I instructed the representative to convey this to Fang, and I believe it will not be difficult for Fang to comply. Many of Ji's subordinates are suspected of being communists, so compliance will not be easy. Currently, his troops are surrounded, so the issue should be resolved without difficulty. Liu Guitang and others have expressed their good intentions. Liu's troops will be reorganized into miscellaneous forces, forming a total of twenty-six regiments. The reorganization will be completed within days. The people of Chahar Province are suffering greatly and cannot be restored in the short term. My purpose in coming here is to report to He on the expenses of reorganizing the miscellaneous forces, and I will also discuss relief matters.

<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan stated that Tang's troops stationed in the Guyuan area have repeatedly sent representatives to Zhang. Because incorporating Tang's troops is not a decision that I can make alone, I have requested instructions from the Military Affairs Commission so that a proper decision can be made. Over Zhihan stated that Chahar Province is facing severe financial constraints, with revenues falling far short of expenditures. It is almost impossible to maintain the expenses of various government agencies. After the loss of Duolun in eastern Chahar, Guyuan, Kangbao, and Baochang counties are essentially unable to remit funds to the province. (10th Dispatch) (Beiping) Qin Dechun stated that the problem with Fang and Ji's troops is that they both want the government to give them nominal titles, which the authorities seem to find difficult. They are fundamentally unwilling to leave the military. Song has repeatedly advised them to relinquish military power, but they have not yet indicated that they will accept. Ji has indeed led his troops to Dushikou but has not yet made contact with Fang's troops. Liu Guitang's rebellious troops have arrived in Dushikou and are mixed with Ji's troops. Song has dispatched Zhao's division to pursue them to prevent the situation from spreading. Liu Guitang, stationed in Chicheng and Dushikou, sent a telegram to Song yesterday expressing his willingness to obey all orders. I have replied with words of commendation. I have come to Beiping with Song to report on the progress of the aftermath and to seek instructions on everything. The first step in the reorganization of the Chahar army has been completed, with a total of twenty-six regiments formed. The second step is to implement downsizing, and how to proceed is still awaiting instructions. Chahar's finances are naturally difficult during this period of aftermath, but both the military and political sides understand the difficult situation and are making every effort to overcome it.

<h3 id="e13">The Recent Lushan Conference Zi <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>For three months ... important party, state, military and political figures have repeatedly met in Lushan. And the recent meeting on the sixth and seventh days has attracted the attention of the people of the country. Finance Minister Song has been abroad for more than a hundred days, traveling to important countries in Europe and America, establishing large cotton and wheat loans, and conducting technical cooperation with the League of Nations. Its impact is not only enough to affect domestic problems in the future, but also related to the situation of the great powers in China. When Song was on his way back home, Japan had already been working towards a false image. The people of the country also made various speculations and hopes about the situation after Song returned. Now Song has arrived in Lushan and exchanged his views with Jiang Wang Sun. Although the matter is different from the official meetings of the party and the state, its importance is even greater. During the conference, the disclosure of a message was used by the listeners to speculate on the future trend of the situation and make various explanations. This is the reason for this.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Wang Song Sun has returned to Beijing and Shanghai after the meeting, and each has made a statement. The content of the conference can be roughly known. Now, after summarizing the statements of various people, the important issues are analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>First, the diplomatic issue. Wang said that the central government's decided policy, Song very much agreed with, and did not have much discussion. Song did not express his opinion on this, and said that it was not convenient to express whether he had made a proposal or what decision. Sun elaborated on the diplomatic policy, taking the survival of the nation as the goal, and said that diplomatic strategy "should be based on adapting to the international situation and the domestic environment as the standard. In terms of methods, it can be changed slightly at any time and place."</p>
<p>Second, the political situation. Wang Song Sun all said that the national government would not be reorganized, but admitted that the National Economic Committee would expand its organization. Sun reported to the Legislative Yuan that this would be used to implement economic control. He also said that if its capabilities are sufficient, it can take on the responsibility of construction and technical cooperation with the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Third, the use of large cotton and wheat loans. The speakers unanimously admitted that it was a major issue in the conference and declared that it would all be used for construction projects and would never be used for military and political expenses. The so-called construction project was explained by Sun as a productive undertaking, and Wang explained it as a construction to revive the rural economy. Sun said that the committee in charge of the safekeeping of funds will be subordinate to the National Economic Committee to comply with the power of control.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Fifth Plenary Session. It should be decided by the central government, which is a matter of course.</p>
<p>After analyzing the above issues based on the statements of Wang Song Sun, we feel that this Lushan conference has achieved considerable results on domestic issues. As for what will happen to foreign affairs, the people of the country still have not been able to get a clear idea. Although Japan is currently gazing at a false image, and the people of the country are also fearful of what Japan is gazing at. It can be seen that this foreign affairs issue is of extremely important nature.</p>
<p>Internally, it is planned to ban unregistered newspapers</p>
<h3 id="e14">It is Planned to First Advise on the Publication of Social News That Describe Adultery and Theft Too Much <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A person in charge of the Ministry of Interior said that there are two procedures for newspaper registration, one is registration, which is handled by the provinces and cities, and the local government must carefully review it, and each newspaper must have proper guarantees to be qualified, and the second is direct review by the ministry to see if the registered newspaper violates the publishing law, such as destroying good customs and endangering national security, all will be handled according to law, and if it is minor, the publication will be detained, and if it is serious, it will be sealed. There are currently more than 3,000 registered newspapers in the country, but there are still many unregistered ones. It is planned to send personnel to various provinces and cities for on-site investigations in the near future. All unregistered ones will be strictly banned in conjunction with the police agencies, and those that have been registered and properly handled will be effectively protected. Foreigners setting up newspapers in our country should also register to avoid violating the laws of the country where they are located. In addition, the Ministry of Interior plans to first advise on the publication of social news, such as those that describe adultery and theft too much. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Song Ziwen said that after the full payment of salaries from July, the national treasury has increased its burden a lot. During his absence from the country, he failed to review the number of accumulated losses in revenue and expenditure on a monthly basis, and urgently awaited overall planning. He specially telegraphed Deputy Minister Zou Lin, Li Kong, etc. to Shanghai to inquire about the total number, and to make a fixed number table for various expenses such as party affairs, government affairs, military education, and subsidies to local temporary increases, and then weigh the total income, how much is the monthly loss, and how to fill it, it is heard that military and political expenses will still be reduced when it is absolutely necessary. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Minister of Finance Zou Lin's replacement of the ministry ended on the 2nd of this month.

<p>Havana Cuban Provisional Revolutionary Committee leader Grau was elected president tonight. Today, the committee spent the whole day persuading several well-known revolutionary leaders and military leaders who were not attached to Machado to serve as president, including Cespedes, but Cespedes was unwilling to be a widow again, and none of the others could compromise with all parties. Finally, it was decided to recommend Dr. Grau to take on this important task. Grau declared that the new government would first restore the administration of the various departments to normal, and then convene a constitutional conference. (9th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana In addition, the Revolutionary Committee appointed four new cabinet members, with Dr. Giterbas as the Minister of Interior, Balkan as the Minister of Finance, Gipas as the Minister of Public Works, and Finley as the Minister of Public Health.

<p>Havana Today, more than 300 expelled military officers gathered at the National Hotel, demanding three things: (1) President Cespedes be reinstated, (2) the Revolutionary Committee be immediately dissolved, and (3) the expelled military officers be reinstated. The Revolutionary Committee replied that it was very willing to reinstate Cespedes, but refused the second item, claiming that the committee wanted to wait for the complete formation of the new government before resigning, and invited the military officers to join the work of organizing the government. As for the issue of reinstatement, it was agreed to discuss it after the new government was formed. The military officers did not agree and threatened to attack the Presidential Palace and expel the Revolutionary Committee. Therefore, the Revolutionary Committee issued a warning of martyrdom, ordering them to stop inciting, otherwise, it would send troops to deal with them with machine guns. The military officers saw that the situation was unfavorable, and they went home in droves.</p>
<p>It is now learned that the demand of more than 300 military officers this morning to dissolve the Revolutionary Committee was instigated by Colonel Farrell, a veteran of the army. Before Desuispi elected, Farrell had a strong voice for the presidency, and the previous betrayal of the army and the Machado government forced him to resign were also under the command of Farrell. Now I am afraid that Farrell's partisans are still unable to be loyal to the Grau government. (9th National Electric)</p>

<p>Havana Grau was not very well-known in the early days of this revolution.

Since Machado first took power, he has been a revolutionary. Later, when Machado began to restrict freedom of speech and teaching in the highest institutions, he strongly resisted, and his name moved the country, but he did not advocate radical means.

<p>Expressing Disapproval of Armed Intervention</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Hull only made irrelevant remarks today, declaring that the government's position is that Cuba should be responsible for maintaining order in its territory, and did not mention the word intervention, probably because it received Argentina's reply note this morning. The note was a reply to the US President's request that the four major Latin American countries try to persuade Cuba to establish an effective government to avoid US intervention. Although the wording was extremely tactful, it clearly expressed that, in any case, it did not approve of the intention of intervention, saying that Cuba could maintain peace and order by itself, and also said that Argentina deeply knew that President Roosevelt opposed intervention in principle, and finally expressed its admiration for President Roosevelt's sincerity in treating people, not coveting neighboring territories, and being willing to listen to Cuba's choice of government.

<p>The US Navy Department stated that nine warships have entered Cuban territorial waters, and many more are sailing to southern ports for emergency needs. The Mississippi battleship, which sailed to the south a few days ago, was ordered to sail directly to Havana today because the State Department received reports that several places in the outer provinces of Cuba lacked effective governments.

<p>(Tokyo) Sugimura Yōtarō, the former Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations Secretariat, a Japanese national, entrusted with a major mission by Foreign Minister Uchida, took the special express train "Tsubame" departing from Tokyo to Osaka at 9 o'clock this morning, and will come to China via the Eastern Provinces. It is rumored that Minister Sugimura will conspire in Tianjin and Peking to seize the rights and interests in North China, and then go to Nanking and Shanghai to obstruct the technical cooperation between our country and the League of Nations. He is scheduled to return to Japan in mid-November.) (Dispatch from the China United Press on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sugimura made a statement on the train, roughly saying that the League of Nations has dispatched cooperative commissioners to China, and the United Kingdom has also appointed Sir Miles Wedderburn Lampson, who is well-versed in the League of Nations, as the British minister to China. The United States and others are either providing loans or selling aircraft. It can be seen that Europe and the United States have once again focused their attention on China. Upon closer inspection of the policies of Britain and the United States towards China, on the surface, they have created a neutral organization and allowed various small countries to participate, seemingly implementing fair activities. In reality, each country is hiding its own intentions and is communicating with each other to achieve certain goals. Japan, at this point, should also act gradually. Britain and the United States believed at the time when the Manchurian Incident broke out that Japan would find it difficult to sustain it for a long time. Unexpectedly, they were able to persevere to the end, beyond their expectations. Therefore, they are in a helpless situation. I am completely like a blank sheet of paper and will strive to fulfill my responsibilities with clarity. That is why I am making this trip.

I should arrive in Shanghai in early October and plan to meet with figures such as Rajchman at that time. I only hope that they will not give unnecessary guidance and bring the Far East into a state of deterioration, which would be fortunate. (Dispatch from the Japanese United Press on the 10th)</p>
<p>Sir Miles Lampson to China</p>
<h3 id="e27">British Newspaper Deeply Pleased to Have Found the Right Person <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Times today published an article welcoming the appointment of Sir Miles Lampson as British minister to China. It first described Lampson's work as the head of the League of Nations Department of the Foreign Office, and then stated that the position of British minister to China is different from ordinary diplomatic posts. If someone like Lampson cannot be found, then one should seek outside the diplomatic circles, following the recent practice of appointing a certain ambassador to the United States. The British minister to China must not be a Confucian scholar-style official, but must understand that his work is half outside the ordinary scope and must have insight, foresight, sympathy, and patience. Lampson possesses all these qualities. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 10th)</p>

<p>Demanding Punishment of the Culprits, an Apology, and the Release of the Detained White Russians</p>
<p>(Harbin) The pseudo-Foreign Ministry today sent a second protest note regarding the search of the [Manchukuo] ship Dongshan (transliteration) by the Soviet Russian political police to the Soviet Russian Consul General here. The [Manchukuo] authorities stated that Soviet Russian secret agents boarded the [Manchukuo] ship on the Ussuri River and kidnapped ten Russian immigrants and took them into Russia. In addition, a team of Soviet Russian armed soldiers crossed the river and demanded the disarmament of the Russian immigrants and their handover to the Russian soldiers. A certain Guo, a leader of anti-[Manchukuo] elements, complied. The first protest note demanded that the Soviet Russia immediately release the ten detained people, severely punish the Soviet Russian political police, the Soviet Russian government should apologize to the [Manchukuo] government, and guarantee that such incidents would not occur again in the future. The [Manchukuo] authorities also lodged a verbal protest regarding this case. The formal note presented today warns Soviet Russia that if it does not respond immediately, there will be serious consequences. The note reiterates the three demands for apology, punishment of the culprits, and return of the detained Russians. The officials in Harbin believe that the time for negotiation has passed and that retaliatory action should be taken. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 10th)</p>
<p>Geneva Disarmament Conference Approaching Reopening</p>
<h3 id="e30">Japan Decides on Response Strategy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from Ambassador Satō to Belgium, the general disarmament conference in Geneva is scheduled to reopen its working committee on the 6th of next month to report on Henderson's discussions with representatives from the United States, France, Italy, and Germany during his summer visit regarding British proposals. Regarding the army, it is proposed to limit tanks and poison gas. As for the naval issue, the status quo will be maintained, pending detailed discussions at the Washington and London conferences. The conference will make a formal resolution on these matters and convene a general committee on October 17 to continue discussing the aforementioned formal resolution. The Japanese government has decided to send Ambassador Satō Naotake to Belgium, Ambassador Mushanokōji Kintomo to Germany, and Vice Admiral Hase Shūshin as representatives to attend the conference. As a result of Satō's negotiations with Henderson during the summer break, it is known that the representatives of the major participating countries have a considerable understanding of Henderson's proposals (except for the issue of military strength). However, the Japanese government, citing the fact that the London Treaty only has provisional effect, has instructed Ambassador Satō to oppose the idea of maintaining the status quo. Regarding the issue of limiting naval forces, it advocates for the abolition of aircraft carriers and submarines and the prohibition of aerial bombing. Although the current conference will not conclude a numerical limitation agreement on the nature and quantity of armaments, but will only decide on an abstract formal resolution, the Japanese representatives plan to continue to adhere to the established policy and advocate for Japan's proposals, so a fierce and arduous battle will be inevitable.

<p>Japan Plans to Establish a Ten-Year Diplomatic Plan for China</p>
<h3 id="e31">Will be Based on the Legacy of Komura Jutarō <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Changing the Previous Policy of Ad Hoc Improvisation</p>
<p>Various Departments Ordered to Engage in Preparatory Work</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun published on the 5th that Foreign Minister Uchida, in order to restore the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, which are currently in a state of flux, to normalcy, has decided, after six months of observing a policy of wait-and-see, to conduct direct negotiations with China at the end of this year (late November or early December). Regarding the specific strategies for direct negotiations, important instructions will be sent to Ambassador to China Ariyoshi Akira. Recently, he has also separately and strictly ordered Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the Asia Bureau Kuwajima, and the three section chiefs of the Asia Bureau to engage in preparatory work regarding the establishment of a new policy toward China. The reason why the start of negotiations is scheduled for after the end of November is that the outline of China's policy toward Japan must be realized after the resolutions of the Third Lushan Conference and the Fifth Plenary Session, which requires at least two more months. At that time, the Japanese side will adopt a policy of peace or war depending on the attitude of the Chinese side. Furthermore, the main objective of the new China policy that Foreign Minister Uchida cherishes is to change the previous conciliatory policy of ad hoc improvisation and to establish a permanent and effective (at least ten-year) basic principle, which can be called a ten-year diplomatic plan for China. This principle will be based on the legacy of the late Marquis Komura Jutarō's [positive policy toward China]. Currently, Foreign Minister Uchida has ordered the aforementioned heads of relevant departments to investigate Sino-Japanese commercial trade relations, investment status, railways, transportation matters such as shipping, and Japanese cultural facilities in China, and to prepare a report as soon as possible, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Also, when direct negotiations begin, the preconditions that the Japanese side will propose are: (1) Thorough suppression of anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese goods movements throughout China; (2) Cessation of treaty and contract violations; (3) Confirmation of whether there is an intention to form a Sino-Japanese economic alliance.) (World News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry is planning a ten-year diplomatic plan for China, in which the plan for North China is to complete new loans for the three major railways. The so-called three major railways in the minds of the Japanese are: (1) Connection of the Longhai Railway and the Shandong Railway; (2) Renovation of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway; (3) Construction rights for the Jinzhang Railway (from Jinzhou via Chengde to Zhangjiakou). It is said that a certain diplomat who is the main culprit of the Twenty-One Demands, under the instructions of the Japanese, is actively lobbying.

<p>Japan Consolidates its Military Strength</p>
<h3 id="e32">Major Reform to be Implemented in the Army System <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Shanghai War, the Japanese army has deeply felt that relying solely on the Yamato spirit cannot guarantee victory on the battlefield. The bravery shown by the 19th Route Army proves that the Chinese spirit cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, reforming military equipment and supplementing firepower, even when fighting against China, will be very difficult after our air force is complete. It is said that the Japanese military has ordered the expeditionary force, the Technical Headquarters, the Army Scientific Research Institute, the Fortification Headquarters, the Aviation Headquarters, the Clothing Factory, the Food Factory, the schools of various arms, and the General Staff Headquarters, etc., to form a committee to study reform matters. It is scheduled to complete the improvement of its military equipment by 1938, that is, to add some modifications to the original plan drafted by the military system investigation committee in June 1931 and implement it. The content of the so-called original plan of the Military Investigation Committee is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e33">Enhancing Combat Power <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(1) Increase the number of heavy machine guns for infantry in unit formations. According to the Japanese, each division previously focused on light machine guns, with each division equipped with 300 light machine guns and 50 heavy machine guns. This will be changed to a policy of parallel light and heavy machine guns. (2) Abolish old-fashioned infantry cannons and replace them with new-style infantry cannons with stronger firepower to increase combat power. (3) Cavalry regiments must be equipped with a sufficient number of heavy machine guns and armored vehicles. (4) Increase the number of light howitzers assigned to the artillery of each division to increase artillery attack power.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Increasing Troops Stationed in Manchuria <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident, the Japanese troops stationed in the Three Eastern Provinces consisted of one division of the Kwantung Army and six battalions of the Independent Garrison. The Japanese General Staff Headquarters had planned to transfer five divisions to Manchuria before the incident, but it was opposed by Foreign Minister Shidehara on the grounds of violating treaties, which prevented it from being realized. The Japanese military then created a new situation by force, allowing it to create a pseudo-state, allowing the Japanese to increase troops at will. The funds required for this plan will be decided by the 65th National Diet.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Increasing Troops in Taiwan and Korea <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The troops stationed in Korea originally consisted of two divisions and an independent garrison. It is planned to increase one division to three divisions and one independent garrison to deal with Soviet Russia. Taiwan, due to its rugged terrain and difficulty in combat, and burdened with the mission of fighting in South China, needs to add an engineer battalion. This plan was realized in 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Expansion of the Air Force <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>In modern land and sea warfare, the air force is the criterion for determining victory or defeat. Therefore, air squadrons, anti-aircraft artillery squadrons, and air observation squadrons should be added. The Japanese Navy has decided to increase eight squadrons starting from next spring, and the Army will also increase the number of aircraft by one time. The personnel have been increasing by 100 people per term since 1932.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Mechanization of the Military <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Russia has four mechanized army groups with five hundred tanks. Japan also wants to increase this type of military equipment, with the aim of being on par with Russia. According to Japan's own claim, Japan only has forty tanks.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Research on Chemical Warfare <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>In future land warfare, poison gas warfare is inevitable. Therefore, specialized schools should be established to study the manufacturing of poison gas weapons and anti-gas measures, and to train in poison gas warfare and anti-gas work.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Training Junior Officers <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In modern warfare, the command and control capabilities of non-commissioned officers are one of the main conditions for victory. The existing training institutions for non-commissioned officers are limited to the infantry arm. During this period, it must be extended to all arms and special arms. Special education teams for officer candidates will be newly established in each regiment. This work has been carried out and promoted since October 1932.</p>

According to their functions, the system of organization and leadership should be reorganized, and their work should be clearly divided. In addition to the platoons in the railway team, separate education units will be established to carry out the education of supplementary soldiers. New wireless radio teams will be established in the communications team, and specialists will be assigned to each division to carry out their special combat training (Dispatch from the China United Press on the 10th)</p>

The second bill transfers the power of the British monarch's representative over appropriations to the Free State government. The third bill terminates the right of appeal to the British Privy Council and establishes the Free State Supreme Court as the final appellate court.

<h3 id="e86">Leader of Spanish Radical Party Ordered to Attempt Formation of New Cabinet <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Madrid dispatch, 9th. Tonight, Lerroux, leader of the Spanish Radical Party, accepted President Zamora's invitation to form a cabinet, and attempt to find new approach for the newly established republic. It is believed that the President hopes to preserve the present National Assembly, and attempt to get cooperation from all parties. It is reported that Lerroux, after taking office, will slightly relax restrictions on Catholic church, especially to repeal the law that deprive 80,000 monks and nuns from teaching in schools, to lower the opposition from the church. However, the socialist party leader claimed a month ago, that if a government is reorganised and ignores the party, they will resort to revolution. Whether Lerroux can get socialist's cooperation is doubted by many, but the President, seeing the increasing disappointment in the country, and after almost neglecting food and sleep due to anxiety, he is convinced that the new prime minister can save the situation. Although ex-Prime Minister Azaña has the support of 112 socialist National Assembly members, he alienated the church and radicals because his approach was too harsh, and will have to leave political stage for now. As the country was unstable in early June, the President worried about class conflict, so he hinted Azaña to resign and invited Lerroux to form a cabinet. The hope was that a compromise can be reached between radical and socialist parties, because the radical party, led by Lerroux, is relatively stable. However, Lerroux did not want to work with the socialists, so the President invited Azaña to form a cabinet again, and let him do it independently. However, the situation did not improve afterwards. In August, Azaña's government arrested 500 royalists and corporatists, accusing them of plotting to overthrow the republic. He was laughed at by all sides, and public support declined further. As the church opposed him for confiscating its properties and restricting its activities, the conservatives criticised him for only talking about policies instead of being a constructive leader, and the radicals did not like his actions, he had to resign eventually. It is rumoured that this resignation, like the previous one, was due to the President's insinuation. However, as Azaña was friendly to the Catalonians, the leaders in Barcelona were worried that Lerroux may not be as friendly to the Catalonia autonomous region.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Public Telegram <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Telegram. All newspapers please note, Henan province has been suffering from disaster and bandits repeatedly, and the people are impoverished and in dire straits. This year in August, the Yellow River overflowed, exceeding the usual level by more than ten feet. The north and south riverbanks have broken simultaneously. According to reports, the counties of Hua, Mengjin, Kaocheng, Meng, Wen, Wuzhi, Fanshui, Lanfeng, Yucheng, Fengqiu, Guangwu, Kaifeng, Zhongmu, Chenliu, Zheng, Yuanwu, Jiyuan, Gong, Lingshi, and Qinyang, etc., are flooded, and there is a vast expanse of water. The plains have become wetlands. As the water came very suddenly, there was no time to prepare. Some cities have been completely flooded, and some embankments have been completely washed away. The old, the weak, women, and children have perished in the waves, and countless have died. Livestock, food, houses, tools, and crops have all been lost to the floods. The losses are incalculable. Those who were able to escape and be rescued have nowhere to stay and are suffering from hunger and cold, crying everywhere. The severity and extent of the disaster are unprecedented in recent decades. Winter is approaching soon, and without clothing or food, life will be even more difficult. Those who are wandering in the ditches are already a terrible sight. Those who are driven to desperation may cause harm to the area. Zhenhua and others are local people and are heartbroken by this catastrophe. We cannot reverse the tide, but we wish to call on others for help. We have always admired your compassion and earnestly request you to show great mercy and work together to do good deeds. Either generously donate from your wealth, or widely solicit relief, or introduce charitable individuals to provide aid, or widely publicize to all parties, in the hopes of doing as much good as possible and saving as many lives as possible. This will turn barren land into fertile land and bring immeasurable blessings. Urgent plea. We hope for your understanding. Liu Zhenhua, Zhang Fang, Liang Guanying, Liu Maoen, respectfully request your consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Beiping <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>–Planning for Emergency Relief in the War Zone–</p>
<p>–Proceeding with the Takeover of Yuguan–</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence. Yu Xuezhong of the Hebei Provincial Government returned to Tianjin from Beijing the day before yesterday. Yesterday (8th) afternoon at 4:00 PM, he arrived in Beiping on a special train, arriving at the East Station at 7:05 PM. Yu made the following statement at the station: "I was summoned by telegram by Chairman Chiang some time ago and left Beijing in mid-September, turning south to Pingnan. After arriving at Guling, I met with Chiang several times. Chiang inquired in detail about the situation in North China. After leaving Jiangxi, I went to Beijing to meet with Chairman Lin and President Wang. After completing these matters, I returned north. The urgent task in Hebei is emergency relief in the war zones of eastern Luan and northern Ji. I plan to convene a meeting immediately to actively proceed with this. As for the proposed issuance of 4 million relief bonds, the issuance period is not yet determined because the Legislative Yuan has not passed the bond regulations. The financial problem in Hebei is that the troops stationed in the province in recent years have exceeded three to four times the number in previous years, and the local burden is too heavy. The central government and Minister Song have agreed that the shortfall can be requested from the central government for assistance. I am currently instructing the Finance Department to prepare a budget for submission to the central government. Although the banditry in eastern Luan is very rampant, the rumor that the number of bandits in the area has reached 20,000 is inaccurate. Regarding the issue of sending troops to eastern Luan to suppress the bandits, after contacting the Japanese military headquarters, the Japanese side has no problems. However, the number of troops to be sent is not yet determined. The number of security teams stationed in the counties of eastern Luan is too small, and the training of special police is urgent. It has been decided that the provincial government will start training them, with a quota of 9,000, to be distributed to various parts of eastern Luan to undertake guard duties. Regarding the issue of the takeover of Lin Yu County, after Commissioner Liu Shisun contacted the matter in Tianjin, the Japanese side has agreed to begin withdrawing immediately. The Japanese puppet organizations in Yu City can be taken over recently. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the five passes of the Great Wall is also currently under negotiation. Regarding the selection of the mayor of Tianjin, I have not heard of the rumor that the central government has internally decided on He Jingwu, so I think it is inaccurate. I am scheduled to visit Commissioner He tomorrow (9th) morning to report on my trip south and discuss the issue of bandit suppression in eastern Luan. Yu went to Jurentang at 9:30 this morning (9th) to visit He, reported on his trip south, and left after talking for about an hour. He went to the Foreign Affairs Building to attend a meeting of the emergency relief group of the North China War Zone Relief Committee. As Prince Carl of Sweden is scheduled to go to Tianjin this morning (9th), the Hebei Provincial Government is scheduled to host a banquet to welcome him at 8:00 PM, so Yu returned to Tianjin on the original special train at 1:40 PM this afternoon to facilitate the reception. He plans to come to Beiping again in the next few days to comprehensively plan for the suppression of bandits in the war zone and the takeover of various passes of the Great Wall in order to proceed. Yu also told reporters at the station, "Regarding the issue of bandit suppression in the war zone, Receiving Commissioner Yin Tong has dispatched personnel to Changchun to contact the Kwantung Army. Once negotiations are completed, our side will send security police to suppress them. Japanese troops are still stationed at the major passes of the Great Wall, and we will be able to take them over after negotiations. Shi Yousan arrived in Tianjin some time ago, and Hu Xie Wu, the leader of Shi's troops, has also arrived in Tianjin. Hu used to work in my Eighth Division, so he can also be said to be one of my old subordinates. Now, after persuasion from various parties, Hu and others have become aware of their mistakes and are willing to prioritize the concept of the country. The issue of the reorganization of Shi's troops will be entirely handled by Hu. The regulations on the administrative inspectors of the war zone have been submitted to the central government for review, but no reply has been received yet. It is not yet known whether Yin Rugeng's resignation as an inspector is true. The War Zone Relief Committee's emergency relief group met this morning, but the meeting was adjourned due to insufficient attendance. During the meeting, someone informally proposed that the relief work in Chahar Province be jointly handled with Hebei Province, but considering that the disaster in Hebei Province occurred first and the importance and urgency of the matter, it seems appropriate to handle them separately to avoid hindering each other."</p>
<p>Receiving Commissioners of the War Zone, Yin Tong, Liu Shisun, Tao Shangming, etc., previously visited He Yingqin to request instructions on all issues regarding the dispatch of troops to eastern Luan to suppress bandits and the takeover of the various passes of Yuguan Great Wall.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>It was decided that Yin et al. would continue to work with the Japanese to handle these issues. Liu Shisun went to Tianjin some time ago to negotiate with Kohtarō Nakamura, the food officer of the Japanese garrison, and plans to go to Yuguan within a day or two to negotiate with the local Japanese troops, returning to Beiping within a week. Tao Shangming also went to Tianjin the day before yesterday to negotiate with the Japanese and returned to Beiping yesterday morning (8th) to discuss everything at Jurentang. According to Tao, there is still no proper and concrete solution to the important issues of the Yuguan takeover and the dispatch of troops to eastern Luan to suppress bandits. Someone has been sent from here to Changchun to contact General Takashi Hishikari, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army. The issue of the return of the various passes of the Great Wall is also being handled by someone in Changchun. Commissioner Liu (Shisun) went to Tianjin some time ago and will still go to Yuguan within a day or two. The banditry in eastern Luan is very rampant, and the people are living in misery. It is hoped that the government will take steps to eliminate it as soon as possible. Regarding emergency relief in the war zone, according to Zhang Yuanshan, director of the agricultural relief group of the War Zone Relief Association, "The agricultural relief funds have been decided to be 4 million in bonds issued by the Hebei Provincial Government, referring to the method used by the China International Famine Relief Commission to handle agricultural relief in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces last year. However, the regulations on the bonds have not yet been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, so it is impossible to contact banks for sales. If it is delayed indefinitely, the spring ploughing next year will be delayed. The Northeast and Rehe Support Association previously allocated 93,000 yuan to the War Zone Relief Committee, which was transferred to this group. We are currently proceeding on a small scale. The agricultural relief areas are in eastern Luan, northern Ji, and southern Chahar, totaling 24 counties. We previously planned to send personnel to start with six counties first, with a period of two months, and the 24 counties will take a total of eight months. 84 field investigators are needed, and it has been decided that the Hebei Provincial Cooperative will select experienced personnel to fill the positions. This group recently hired 20 members from the cooperative, who are scheduled to gather in this group on the 15th of this month, and will then be given supplementary training for ten days. After the 25th of this month, they can set off, investigating while organizing mutual aid societies. Once the organization is complete, relief funds will be loaned out, and after one place is completely settled, they will proceed to other places." (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Yellow River Flood in Henan Continues to Recede <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Five Provinces Telegraph Request to Move Yellow River Commission Downstream</p>
<p>Henan Provincial Relief Committee Appeals for Relief by Telegraph</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence. The Yellow River water level continues to drop significantly, and there seems to be no danger this year. The people of Bian are reassured, and discussions are gradually subsiding. Some time ago, the Civil Affairs Department sent Liu Zhangbo, the Finance Department sent Lu XieTang, the Construction Department sent Li Jichang, and the River Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Shaoyi to inspect the Hei Gang Kou river embankment. It is said that the cost of repairing the main embankment is 50,000 yuan, and the cost of repairing the polder embankment is 200,000 yuan. However, the funds have not yet been secured. Liu Zhi previously telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission be moved to a central location downstream, and also telegraphed the chairmen of the four provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui, requesting a joint telegram. Now that they have replied with their consent, a telegram was sent to Lin and Wang today, and a provincial relief meeting was held to appeal to all parties to rescue those in distress. The texts of the telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e90">Telegram to the Government and Executive Yuan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Urgent. Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, in secret, examination of the Yellow River’s upstream does not reveal any prior disasters. From Mengjin downwards, to Lijin towards the ocean, the terrain is flat and sparse, and the river course is wide and dispersed. With a lack of silt, the riverbed rises several feet up to as much as two Zhang above the ground. During the Qing dynasty, the Yellow River breached in Henan 26 times; therefore the river supervisor at the time was located in Kaifeng to instruct with convenience, and command with dexterity. There are profound intentions. This time, the Yellow River swelled to an unprecedented level, causing widespread flooding. Still it occurred in the downstream. Now that the water has returned to its bed, the levees and dams on both banks are collapsing section by section. If we do not come up with methods to reinforce, then next year, with rising waters, the river will again flow uncontained and form another channel. The officials, examining previous disasters and considering current circumstances, believe that the Water Conservancy Commission, holding overall planning responsibility, with its headquarters far in Xijing, creates great inconvenience for surveying places where dangerous constructions might arise, planning, guiding engineering, or interim emergency repairs. The travel takes time. Therefore it is more appropriate that it be moved to a central location downstream so that it can take overall control of the river, so as not to miss opportunities. There is an agreement to request this together by telegram. Awaiting your approval and implementation, Chairman Gu Zhutong of Jiangsu, Chairman Han Fuqu of Shandong, Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei, Chairman Liu Zhenhua of Anhui, and Chairman Liu Zhi of Henan, bow in obedience</p>

<h3 id="e92">Provincial Relief Committee Telegram <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Relief Committee sent a telegram yesterday on behalf of Nanjing National Government Chairman Lin, General Commander Jiang in Guling, Nanjing Executive Yuan President and Minister of Internal Affairs, Chairman of the Relief Committee, and various charities in the North and South. (Titles omitted) Greetings. Henan Province, located in the Central Plains, is poor and barren, and in recent years, there have been disasters every year, leading to the desolation of the people's livelihood. Central Government and various charities in the North and South have provided generous assistance and relief. However, Heaven has not ceased to cause trouble, and disasters have piled on top of disasters. Due to a sudden, devastating flood of the Yellow River, the embankments in the counties of Kaocheng, Lanfeng, Huaxian, Mengjin, Fengqiu, Fanshui, Minquan, Kaifeng, Mengxian, Qinyang, Guangwu, Chenliu, Yucheng, Gongxian, Jiyuan, Wuzhi, Wenxian, Shangqiu, Xin'an, Shanxian, Mianchi, and Lingbao, etc., have collapsed, the river water has burst its banks, and the overflowing water has flowed horizontally, like wild horses. The torrential waves have arrived suddenly, collapsing villages and emptying turbid waves. Fields have been destroyed, the old and weak have been swept into the quicksand, and adults and children are trapped. Corpses have already begun to stink, young people climb to the roofs of houses and trees, suffering from hunger and cold, and their breath barely remains. Some cling to beams of wood and float, risking life and death amidst the waves, while others stand precariously and look into the distance, hoping for boats to come to their rescue. The suffering in the world is unbearable, and it is a pity for all to see. Now that the autumn wind is blowing and the summer is over, there are no houses to live in, no grains to eat, no clothes to wear, and no medicine to treat illness. The dead have already turned into insects in the sand, and the living are urgently seeking relief. Fields are full of such sights, and the organization is performing its duties day and night, but we lack funds. We hope that the Central Government and charitable people will share the sentiment of helping those in need and jointly rescue those who are starving and drowning. We ask for a donation to heal the root of the problem, or donate cotton clothing or purchase medicines, and send them out into the wind. The harvest will return to the fields. Remote decrees, disaster people continue their lives. We send the telegram with hope. We bow our heads. Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee. (September 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Lu Representative's Journey to Beijing to Petition for Disaster Relief <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>丨He Siyuan, Ge Xiangyi, and Others Have Returned to Jinan丨</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: He Siyuan, Director of Education of Shandong Province, departed from Jinan for Beijing on the 1st of this month to meet with Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, to report on the disastrous floods in the province and earnestly request the allocation of funds for emergency relief. He then boarded the Pinghu Railway train on the evening of the 7th, heading north from Beijing, and arrived in Jinan at 7:00 AM today (the 8th). In the afternoon, around 3:00 PM, he went to the Provincial Government to meet with Han Fuqu to report on his journey to Beijing. Ge Xiangyi and other representatives from western Shandong, who had also gone to Beijing to petition for disaster relief, returned to Jinan with He Siyuan. They will return to Heze on the same day to report the situation in Beijing to the disaster victims and convey the central government's intentions. According to He Siyuan's account of his journey to Beijing, he stated: "After arriving in Beijing, I immediately visited President Wang Jingwei to report on the disaster situation in the province and earnestly request assistance. Wang replied that Shandong Province had suffered a severe flood, and the disaster was exceptionally severe, as he had seen in detail in the newspapers. When the representatives arrived in Beijing to meet with him, they wept and expressed their grievances, which were especially sincere. He had already decided to allocate funds for disaster relief and had first telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government to allocate 500,000 yuan for emergency relief to avoid exchange procedures. These funds will be reimbursed after the central government has made proper arrangements. He dared to guarantee this with his personal integrity." From this, it is clear that the central government attaches great importance to the disaster situation in Shandong. Before leaving, Wang also instructed Peng Xuepei, the Director of the Political Affairs Department, to inform him that they would meet at 9:30 AM the next day (the 2nd) at the Executive Yuan to discuss emergency relief measures for western Shandong. Subsequently, that evening, he received a phone call from Peng, stating that Minister Song Ziwen was scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the 2nd, and there might not be time to meet, so the meeting was rescheduled for 6:00 PM on the 2nd. The next day, introduced by Tang Xiang, he visited Song at 5:00 PM on the 2nd to report on the disastrous situation in western Shandong and request urgent relief measures. The conversation lasted a long time, and it was almost 7:00 PM when he left Song's residence. Wang had already left the Yuan and returned home, leaving Peng Xuepei to wait to meet with them. At that time, he told him that Wang would be going to Lushan on the 3rd and might not be able to meet. Later, at 10:00 PM, Peng again told them that Wang, considering the earnestness of the representatives, had specially scheduled a meeting at the Yuan at 6:00 AM the next day (the 3rd). He, Zhang Weicun, Ge Xiangyi, and 14 other representatives from western Shandong, complied and went to pay their respects at that time, reporting everything. Representative Ge Xiangyi also recounted the disastrous situation and the differences between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River situations. The Yangtze River flows slowly and is lower than the dikes. At most, there is only the risk of overflow, and the people of Jiangnan have many boats, so disasters are not a problem. The Yellow River is different, the river flows rapidly and the water is higher than the embankments, as well as several counties. Furthermore, Shandong has never had a breach, and each disaster originates in Hebei Province. He also requested that the central government coordinate the entire plan to manage the Yellow River and prevent floods in North China. Wang expressed deep agreement with his views. Wang also said that the Yellow River Conservancy Commission was established in 1928, with Feng Yuxiang as the chairman, but there were no results for several years, only a false reputation. Later, Zhu Qinglan was appointed as the chairman, and the same was true after several years. Although it was directly under the National Government at that time, there was practically no work done. Therefore, this reorganization is purely focused on practical work, with the appointment of water conservancy expert Li Yizhi as the chairman, and technical specialists from all parties as members and other important officials, and directly under the Executive Yuan to facilitate the progress of the project. The commission's major task is to unify the Yellow River system and formulate a fundamental plan for river management. As for the actual work, it still depends on the joint efforts and cooperation of the provincial governments. The central government has decided to actively raise funds for disaster relief in western Shandong and the Yellow River disaster area. With Minister Song's return to the country, it should not be difficult to raise these funds. The funds advanced by the provincial governments should be reimbursed immediately. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Yellow River Flood Relief Association held a standing committee meeting. He and others visited Liu Ruiheng, the acting chairman, and Xi Wujiu, the chief of the engineering department of the association, to discuss the situation of the flood in western Shandong in detail. Xi showed him a map of the disaster area in western Shandong, which was mostly inaccurate, and they pointed out the corrections. At 8:00 PM on the 4th, they met again at Liu Ruiheng's private residence, and also met with Mei Yilin and others. Regarding disaster relief, it was decided that the Central Relief Commission would directly send personnel to the north to provide relief with the remaining 3 million yuan, adopting a district-based, not province-based approach, to eliminate regional boundaries. Liu Ruiheng decided to send Mei Yilin to western Shandong first to survey the disaster. He immediately telegraphed Chairman Han to send senior officials to accompany Mei on the survey, to show sincerity in attaching importance and assisting. While in Beijing, he informed all parties in the central government that Shandong Province would ensure the speed, integrity, and absence of other problems in disaster relief, whether it be food, transportation, or relief personnel. At the meeting of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the situation of the disaster in Shandong was understood to be manageable.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Inspection Report of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei by Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent, Ren An <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Liling County Town and Villages</p>
<p>Liling Special Dispatch: It is traditionally said that there is a hill north of Liling County, and at the foot of the hill is a well with a spring as sweet as liqueur, hence the name of the county. Today, there is still a stone-built square well outside the North Gate, with a stone tablet covered in moss standing beside it, inscribed with the four characters "Liqueur Spring Immersing the Moon," which are powerful and impressive. It is said that this well is also one of the "Eight Scenic Spots of the Lu River," but the water storage is very shallow, like a small pond, and sometimes it dries up, so the spring is no longer visible today. The county town is located on both banks of the Lu River, with the South Gate on the south bank of the river, and the remaining three gates on the north bank. Connecting the traffic between the two banks is the Lu River Bridge, which is more than two zhang wide and more than thirty zhang long. The river comes from the east, encircles the south and west, and Jiangling stands towering to the north, so the city has the momentum of relying on the mountains and facing the water. The ancients had the lines "The mountain is low and connected to the shore, the sound of the river curves around the city," and "People everywhere live by the water, opening the window to sit and watch the mountains," which can truly be said to be poems for the city.</p>
<p>Liling's transportation is convenient by both water and land. The Zhuping and Yuehan railways pass through the county. The ordinary express train that the reporter took from Jiangxi to Liling, which transported both coal and passengers, was very slow and poorly equipped. The station name signs were mostly collapsed, making it difficult for passengers to identify their destination when getting off the train.</p>
<p>Laoguan, also known as Chalingguan, is an important place where Jiangxi and Hunan meet. The scenery seen after passing through the pass into Hunan is very different from that of Jiangxi, which can't help but make people feel moved. The farmers seen are mostly strong men with full expressions. Recalling the villages in Jiangxi, most of them were old and weak people. When spoken to, they seemed to turn a deaf ear, but on closer inspection, they seemed to contain infinite pain. Compared with the Hunan farmers with full expressions, they were completely different. Moreover, there were no soldiers checking luggage when entering Liling City. The people in the market were bustling and lively, and the business district was full of vitality. It is undoubtedly a happy land. However, reading the local Minbao and Lujiang Xingbao, border bandit police reports are still occasionally heard. The county government and local public groups have enacted and promulgated numerous and strict laws and regulations regarding the pacification of bandits by the Baojia system. Violation is punishable by beheading and collective punishment, and shooting is only secondary. It is said that in the years 1927 and 1928, the bandits who were killed numbered in the dozens every day, totaling about 6,000 people, including more than 60 students, especially young people aged 13 or 14. The farmers in the southern district were deeply banditized, and men were killed when they were suppressed. Many people fled abroad, resulting in a severe shortage of men in the area for a time.</p>
<p>According to Director Pan of the Education Bureau, the education situation is that the funds received are 15,000 piculs of grain rent, worth about 20,000 yuan, about 20,000 yuan in additional taxes, and 10,000 yuan in deed taxes, totaling about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The expenses are also the same. When the price of grain is low, it is not enough. There are also district funds, and the annual income also increases and decreases from time to time. The county has one normal school and one women's normal school, each with one or two classes attached to the middle school, 15 higher primary schools, and originally 900 lower primary schools, but now there are only 700 schools. The low price of grain not only affects education but also the local production, which will shrink day by day. Taking the grain itself as an example, the cost of each stone is about three yuan, but the selling price is no more than two yuan. The farmers' hard work for a year results in harm to them. From then on, farming is casual, and more planting means more loss, and less planting means a sharp decline in production. Both are harmful to the farmers, and the hidden worries of society are truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Liling's products have always been known for their abundance: (1) Porcelain. The porcelain clay in the county extends for dozens of miles. The kilns for manufacturing porcelain originally numbered 13, namely, Model, Cooperative, Minli, Heji, Yuhua, Improved, Shunye, Dehou, Tianbao, Minsheng, Zhonghe, Jiuru, and Chuli factories. Each factory fired three kilns a month, for ten months a year, worth more than 300,000 yuan. The total value of each factory reached three to four million yuan. The amount sold to other provinces was about three million yuan. Recently, due to the stagnation of the rural economy, sales have decreased sharply. Each factory now produces only one-third of its original output, and there is still a mountain of goods. The Jiuru and Chuli factories have already closed down, and the remaining eleven factories, as well as more than 20 local porcelain factories that are struggling to survive, are also in a precarious situation. The total number of workers who rely on the porcelain industry for their livelihood, directly and indirectly, is 200,000, which is equivalent to one-third of the county's population. Now, they are also gradually becoming unemployed in large numbers. The county government is deeply concerned that these workers will have nothing to eat and will increase the number of vagrants in society, creating new bandits in the area. Recently, it has specially loaned 10,000 yuan of working capital to each factory in the hope of restoring the old business, but with little porridge and many monks, it is doubtful whether it can provide widespread relief. It is noted that Liling porcelain has always had a good reputation. In 1909, the Nanyang Industrial Exhibition was held in Nanjing, and Liling porcelain went to compete and won a first-class gold medal, ranking above Jingdezhen. If it is further improved and refined, it can also resist foreign porcelain. For the sake of maintaining national rights and interests and people's livelihood, the government must have a way to maintain it. (2) Tea. In the past, Liling tea was exported abroad, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan a year. Later, due to the mixing of miscellaneous leaves, its reputation fell. Today, the tea used is imported from Pingxiang and Youxian. Improvements have recently been promoted, but the results are not yet obvious. (3) Summer cloth. The quality is the best in the country, with annual exports worth about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, but now sales are sluggish, and it has fallen to about 300,000 yuan. (4) Indigo. Before the rise of foreign indigo, this county and Pingtan and other places all obtained their supplies from this. Since the invasion of foreign indigo, the price of indigo has plummeted, and many farmers have abandoned planting it. If the manufacturing is not improved and domestic products are not promoted, it will soon become extinct.</p>
<p>The reporter was invited by his friend Mr. Zhang to visit the villages in the eastern countryside. Going up the Lu River, the trees are lush, and the fragrance of rice is refreshing. The scenery is pleasant, and I forget the hardships of the journey. The mountain villages are densely populated, and there is little abandoned land. Rice is divided into early and late crops. The late rice planted among the rows of early rice is called Yahe, also known as Erhe. The late rice planted after the early rice is harvested is called Fanzi, also known as Shun (it is taboo to say Fan, so it is said backwards). In addition to applying manure and lime, fertilizer is also made by inserting cigarette butts into the roots of the rice, which is quite peculiar. Most of the farmers are tenant farmers, accounting for more than 80% of the population. Liling County originally had many large landlords with more than a thousand stones of land. Recently, in order to avoid attracting attention to the term "large landlord," there have been many cases of fathers and sons and brothers dividing the property and managing it. The price of land, which was previously worth more than 200 yuan per dou (about one mu), is now sold for 70 to 80 yuan, but there are still no takers. It is said that each surname has a family temple, but the system has been abandoned to the extreme. Commander Liu of the garrison is doing his best to promote and restore the old rules, but no one dares to take the lead because they are afraid that the Red Army will regard them as feudal elements. In the main hall of the residences, there are shrines dedicated to Heaven, Earth, Emperor, Parents, and Teacher, or the word "Emperor" is changed to "Country" or "Honor." Next to it are the ancestral tablets, the Earth God, and other gods. Every village and community must have a community god, called the Great King, each with a different title. Their images are mostly sculpted as armed soldiers in armor. It is said that during the Yuan Dynasty, Mongol soldiers were stationed in every ten households to monitor the local people and were called the Great King. The accumulated hatred was deep, so they agreed to get the Mongols drunk on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival and kill them all at the same time, calling it killing the Tartars. After killing them, they were afraid that they would become malevolent spirits, so they worshiped them in the temple of the community god and called it the Great King Temple. The secret code for agreeing to kill the Tartars at that time was called "Reporting Spring." The reporter of spring always held a red paper, on which was drawn a picture of a person following an ox, titled "Sending the Spring Ox to Your Home, Everything is Flourishing and Enjoying Glory, Four Seasons of Good Weather, Generations of Children and Grandchildren Rich and Noble." The paper is sent to each household and must be rewarded appropriately. This custom is still followed today. The reporter visited several of Mr. Zhang's relatives and friends. Upon entering the door, the host was courteous and enthusiastic. In addition to offering cigarettes, tea, cakes, and fruits, the hostess also offered her homemade chili peppers (soaked in salt) to entertain the guests, which tasted quite good, but those who were not accustomed to eating chili peppers could not stand it.</p>
<p>Liling was formerly known as a remote county, and its people were very conservative. Since the rise of the military, many farmers have abandoned their hoes to join the army. They support each other, and the number of people who go out to make a living is increasing day by day. The number of people who have risen through military exploits is also increasing day by day. He Jian, the current commander-in-chief of the Western Route and chairman of Hunan Province, Liu Jianxu, the commander of the 28th Army, Tao Guang, the commander of the 62nd Division, Zhong Guangren, the deputy brigade commander, Chen Mingren, the deputy commander of the 80th Division, Yan Guotao, the commander of the 6th Security District, Deng Wenyi, the staff secretary of the Military Commission, Yi Shuzhu, the secretary-general of the Fourth Route Headquarters, and Zhang Kailian, the director of the Hunan Provincial Finance Department, are all from Liling. In the past, the villagers felt that Chiang Kai-shek cared about his hometown (Fenghua, Zhejiang) and paid attention to education and construction. They had discussed that Chairman He should follow Chiang's example and voluntarily donate a large sum of money to establish a Yunqiao (He's pseudonym) school in the county town so that children of commoners could attend school for free.

<h3 id="e95">Tragedy in the Pear Garden: Liu Xiaoheng's Blood Stains the Stage <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>=Assailant Mounts the Stage and Stabs During Performance=</p>
<p>=Supporting Actor Zhang Wenyuan Also Stabbed Simultaneously=</p>
<p>=The Assailant Unable to Escape, Commits Suicide on the Spot=</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Celebrated Dan (female role) Liu Xiaoheng is the son of the late Tongchui Hualian (painted face role) Liu Yongchun. He initially performed as Laosheng (old male role) without much renown. Later, he switched to Huashan (florid shirt, a type of female role), achieving great fame. Among Huashan roles in Shanghai, he was one of the top figures. His performance in the play "The Civet Cat for the Crown Prince" was popular overseas, a piece co-created by Xiaoheng and the well-known Wusheng (martial male role) Chang Chunheng. During the January 28th Incident and the Shanghai War, Xiaoheng also found it difficult to recover his situation for a time. He took a steamer north and performed in Yantai, Qingdao, Dalian, and other places. This spring, he was again hired by Dalian to perform at the Xishangang Grand Stage, with excellent results. All the supporting actors in Xiaoheng's plays were people who had been with him for many years. One small Hualian actor joined his troupe when Xiaoheng arrived in Dalian, playing a supporting role. In April of this year, Xiaoheng was invited by a theater in Andong to perform for two months. This small Hualian actor also accompanied him. After the contract expired, Liu dismissed him because he acted too rigidly and could not enhance the performance. Liu's Qinyin (stringed instrument) player recommended another small Hualian actor as a replacement. The father of the dismissed small Hualian actor worked as a Jianchang (stage checker) at the Xishangang Grand Stage. He was very resentful because his son was dismissed by Liu. Furthermore, he resented even more because the small Hualian actor who was now performing with Xiaoheng was recommended by Liu's Qinyin player. Little did anyone know that a murderous intent was brewing.</p>
<p>The stage checker, surnamed Mou, was extremely anxious because his son was unemployed. He decided to kill Liu and Liu's Qinyin player, as well as the small Hualian actor currently performing with Liu, to vent his anger. He specially purchased an extremely sharp Japanese sword and hid it in his sleeve. One evening a week ago, Xiaoheng was performing "Wulongyuan Kills Xi" with Yang Ruiting and the small Hualian actor. The stage checker secretly drew his sharp blade and stood inside the stage door. No one backstage noticed. When Song Jiang called for the door and Yan Poxi ordered Zhang Wenyuan to temporarily avoid him, walking into the backstage from the back entrance, (according to this play, Xiaoheng plays Yan Poxi, Ruiting plays Song Gongming, and the small Hualian actor plays Zhang Wenyuan,) the stage checker took advantage of his unpreparedness and suddenly stabbed him in the abdomen with his blade. The small Hualian actor screamed in extreme pain and fainted on the spot. When the backstage crew saw the murder, they rushed to rescue him. Taking advantage of the confusion, the stage checker ran to the front stage with the blade. At this time, Xiaoheng was still in dialogue with Ruiting and was unaware of the tragedy that had occurred backstage. When he saw the stage checker running out with a steel knife covered in blood, he knew something was wrong. Before he could escape, the blade had entered Xiaoheng's abdomen. Fortunately, Yang Ruiting was a Wusheng actor and reacted quickly. He pushed the man with great force, reducing the impact of the strike. When the knife was pulled out, Xiaoheng was covered in blood. After being stabbed, Xiaoheng said loudly, "What hatred do I have with you that you dare to commit such a violent act?" When he lowered his head and saw the fresh blood gushing from his abdomen, he let out a cry and fell to the stage. After stabbing Xiaoheng, the stage checker took his knife to the prop table, intending to kill Liu's Qinyin player to complete his planned murder. When he saw that the person playing the instrument was not Xiaoheng's Qinyin player but Ruiting's assistant, he stomped his feet and shouted, "What a cheap son of a bitch!" Seeing the leading actor stabbed and lying on the stage covered in blood, the front and back stage crew hurriedly carried Xiaoheng backstage.</p>
<p>The assailant, seeing that he had killed two of his three enemies, attempted to escape. He saw that he was surrounded on all sides, with armed police standing in front of the stage with guns, and the martial arts performers in the troupe blocking the upper and lower stage doors with weapons. They all shouted for him to throw away the murder weapon and surrender quickly. Seeing the situation, he knew he could not escape. He let out a loud laugh, held the blade against his own neck, and with a powerful stroke, his head rolled off with the knife. His body then fell to the stage.</p>
<p>There were many spectators in the theater that evening. Just as they were enjoying the art of Liu and Yang, they suddenly witnessed the tragedy. The order was completely disrupted, and people rushed to escape, destroying tables and chairs and shattering tea sets. Countless people were挤傷 (squeezed and injured), 摔傷 (fell and injured), 跌傷 (tripped and injured), 踏傷 (trampled and injured), 碰傷 (bumped and injured), and 撞傷 (collided and injured).</p>
<p>Seeing that the assailant had committed suicide, the front and back stage crew first set about rescuing the two injured men. They quickly had a car send them to a foreign hospital for treatment. After examining Xiaoheng, the hospital said that his large intestine had been severely injured. They first used anesthesia to make Liu unconscious, then cut open his abdomen and treated the stabbing wounds. After sewing him up with medicated thread and using chicken skin to seal the wound, the doctor said that if there were no other complications within a week, his life could be saved. The small Hualian actor also relied on the strength of the chicken skin to seal the wound. Last night, a performer came to Tianjin from Dalian, saying that Liu and the others' injuries were improving and that there should be no accidents.</p>
<p>Murder cases in the Pear Garden have been endless for more than 20 years, but they usually occurred either inside the residence or on the way home after the performance. This time, to be brutally murdered while performing on stage is unprecedented. (September 7th)</p>

<p>Woman from Jiangbei Deceived and Hangs Herself</p>
<p>A woman was found hanging in the Kui Xing Pavilion across the river from the West Temple of Literature in this city yesterday (the 9th) evening. Her limbs were already stiff, and there was no way to save her. The woman appeared to be dressed as someone from Jiangbei. Many people from Jiangbei live in this area, gathering to cultivate land and growing vegetables to make a living. After the town police investigated house by house, it was discovered that she was Wu Quanzhen's wife, Wu Pan, from Jiangbei. She was 30 years old and had a 10-year-old son. She usually saved every penny and accumulated 190 yuan through hard work. Wang Guilin, a fellow villager, deceived her by saying that they would jointly purchase several acres of wasteland and cultivate it together. The woman was seduced by the prospect of great profits and handed over the money, agreeing on a date for the transfer. However, when the date arrived, Wang Guilin was nowhere to be found. When asked, the landlord denied the matter. The woman realized that she had been deceived and was extremely distraught. Overcome with resentment, she sought this short end. Her husband has reported the matter to the authorities for an inquest and is preparing for the funeral.</p>

<p>Military Officer Kills Wife and Then Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Zhong Xunqi, a Hunan native and former junior military officer, lived with his wife, Su Zhen, at No. 7 Balian Bridge in Chaimanwai. The couple was in their twenties and had a very close relationship. On the afternoon of the 9th, the couple went out together and returned home around 7:00 PM. A conflict suddenly arose, but it quickly subsided. Around midnight that night, Yu Qichang, a servant of the Zhang family who lived with them, suddenly heard a terrible cry from Zhong's room. Knowing something was wrong, he immediately called another resident, Zhang Heshang, and they planned to push the door open to see what was happening. However, at that moment, the lights in the room suddenly went out. They lit a candle and entered, only to find Zhong and his wife lying in a pool of blood. A kitchen knife was left beside Zhong. They reported it to the police station, who sent police to the scene to investigate. The two were already dead. When the tragedy occurred, the light wire in their room was cut, causing all the lights in the house to go out. On the morning of the 10th, they reported to the court to come for an inquest. Unexpectedly, Zhong, whose throat had not been completely severed, suddenly revived. He secretly took a kitchen knife from the residence and madly rushed out, slashing at anyone he encountered. Passersby fled in all directions. The police chased after him, but Zhong ran straight to Xiajin Bridge and jumped into the river. He was pulled out, already dead. In the afternoon, the judge conducted an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that Zhong had only one wound to his throat from the self-inflicted cut. His wife, Su Zhen, had her right wrist severed, and there were many knife wounds on her private parts, legs, and neck. It appeared that Zhong killed his wife and then committed suicide due to an affair. Since there were no relatives, there was no way to know the truth. The local police were instructed to prepare a coffin and await further investigation.</p>

<p>Striving Against the Province to Retain County Funds</p>
<p>The Public Funds and Public Property Management Office of this county previously received an official letter from the county government, forwarding instructions from the Jian Ting, ordering that 8,100 yuan for the provincial-level agricultural, forestry, silkworm, and fishery fields located in Xiyi, 2,700 yuan for the salaries and expenses of industrial guidance technicians, should still be remitted monthly from May of this year, in accordance with the Ting's instructions. After receiving the letter, the office believed that since self-government was based on the county as a unit, all undertakings should also be based on the county. The special funds for industry in each county mainly came from the two-cent per mu donation for agricultural improvement levied since 1929. The original plan for provincial Ting collection had been repeatedly ordered and strictly prohibited from being used for other purposes. It was to be used specifically for agricultural improvement in each county, with detailed budgets that could not be mixed up. The county's undertakings were endless, and the county's funds were only insufficient. If the development of county undertakings was to be sought, it would still depend on the provincial funds to supplement it. Now, the agricultural improvement mu donation, which was levied specifically for each county since 1929, was being taken for the expenses of provincial undertakings, ignoring the established case of 1929. This created the suspicion of mixing provincial and county affairs, greatly affecting local finances. Moreover, after reviewing the local budget for 1933, it was truly impossible to allocate from it. Therefore, they specially sent a letter to the county government yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the provincial Ting to investigate and determine which expenses under the budget item should be used in detail to facilitate compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Director of Education Bureau Accused <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since Zang Hulu came to the Education Bureau, he stopped allocating funds to the privately run Dunmu Elementary School in Xiangxiangbang, South Township of this county. The school board of directors repeatedly sent people to negotiate, and he agreed to maintain the funds. Later, it was discovered that Director Zang had falsely claimed and embezzled the school's funds. The school board of directors reported the matter to the provincial and county governments, requesting a thorough investigation to rectify the situation. However, in July of this year, Director Zang stopped allocating all of the school's funds. The association believed that Director Zang did not understand the situation and that because they had exposed his private matters, he was ashamed and angry. He did not hesitate to distort the official documents to suppress them, wantonly destroy the school, and arbitrarily stop the allocation of regular funds, putting the school to death as revenge. Yesterday, they specifically prepared a document presenting the situation of the Education Bureau's suspension of regular funds and the accumulated losses to the provincial Ting for verification and defense.</p>

<p>Bai Wennian's third son, a resident of Fangjia Lane Town in the northern countryside of the county, had reached the age of adulthood but suffered from occasional bouts of madness. The other day, he led an ox to graze in the graveyards behind the town. Coincidentally, three girls from Zhu Village, aged eight, nine, and twelve, were playing together. Bai's madness suddenly flared up, and he made frivolous advances. The girls, feeling insulted and extremely ashamed, pushed Bai to the ground and beat him severely. Unexpectedly, the wooden stick struck a vital spot, causing instant death. By the time his father, Wennian, rushed to the scene, it was too late to save him. He negotiated with the parents of the girls. As a result, Zhang Shixiang and others from the town's meat industry acted as mediators, providing 300 yuan for clothing, a coffin, and funeral expenses, and the matter was settled.</p>

<p>A bandit gang led by Zhang Big Nose, who had been causing trouble in Hanshan County, infiltrated the Huatangji and Guangxingji areas in Hefei on the 4th from Dongxi Huangshan and Xianzong, setting up bases and looting. The Hefei Security Brigade, which had been dispatched to Liangyuan Town to prevent them, received the alert.

At 4:00 PM, Liu Chao, Hu Jiamai, Chen Qixia, Gao Zhihang, Chen Jiashang, and the other five instructors from the aviation school flew back to the Jianqiao Airfield in Hangzhou and joined the aviation team. The remaining nine aircraft that came to Shanghai to participate in the ceremony also returned to Hangzhou at the same time, led by Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Department, and Mao Bangchu, Principal of the Aviation School. Before leaving, Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, personally went to Hongqiao Airfield to see them off. It is also reported that when the naming ceremony of the [Zhejiang Save-the-Nation Aircraft], organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department and the Anti-Japanese Save-the-Nation Association, is held in Jianqiao on the 18th of this month, a telegram has been sent to Secretary-General Lin Wojiang, inviting him to attend.</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang Rescheduled to Fly to Hangzhou This Morning</p>
<p>Stay in Hangzhou for a Week Before Continuing the Flight</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang, a young pilot who studied in Germany, participated in the naming ceremony of the five aircraft. He was originally scheduled to fly to Hangzhou yesterday morning to continue his nationwide flight. However, due to fatigue from continuous socializing and after being retained by Lin Wojiang of the Aviation Association, he decided to postpone it to 9:00 AM this morning. He will fly to Hangzhou from Hongqiao Airfield with his classmate Wang Zuwen in his own aircraft. He plans to stay in Hangzhou for a week, take a short tour, and then fly to Hankou, Changsha, North China, and other places.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 0:30, aviator Sun Tonggang gave a broadcast speech on the radio station at the Central Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road. Chen Tingzhen of the Central Western Pharmacy first gave an introduction, followed by Sun's speech. He stated that after the European War, countries around the world focused on military equipment and aviation construction. In France alone, there were more than 5,000 aircraft. The United Kingdom and the United States were also expanding significantly. Although Germany's quantity cannot be examined in detail due to treaty restrictions, the degree of its increase may not be lower than that of the great powers. After the failure of previous attempts to mediate world peace, countries have been increasingly preparing for war in the Pacific. The key instrument for future struggles will be the air force. Although our country has gradually begun to make efforts in this regard, it still lags behind the great powers by a factor of ten or twenty. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will work together to preserve the inherent glory of our nation and maintain the inherent territory of our country. Even the backwardness of Chinese culture, the desolation of the frontier, and the like, cannot be addressed without a great air force to bridge the gaps. Therefore, for the sake of the country and the nation, we must engage in the construction of the air force. The reason I flew back to China, encountering all kinds of dangers, was simply to make the compatriots in the country know what to strive for and what to advocate. As for personal donations of money, I only seek to benefit the public and the country and to win glory for our country. After the speech, Zhou Bangjun, the manager of the Central Western Pharmacy, delivered a farewell speech.</p>

<p>The reorganization of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments has been decided. Chen Guofu, the new chairman of Jiangsu, must be announced within a few days. Zhou Fohai, Director of the Education Department, and Yu Jingtang, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, have been internally appointed.

To save the nation, we rely on aviation. This association is determined to uphold its integrity and assume the responsibility of advocacy. We have been working hard to raise funds and order warplanes. On June 10th, we first contributed the No. 1 Shanghai Municipality aircraft to the government and incorporated it into the Air Force. We have already telegraphed and reported this, inviting you to review it. Now, we are sending five more aircraft to Shanghai: the Boy Scout, Hushang, Hugong, Huxiao, and Ningbo. A naming ceremony will be held at Hongqiao Airfield at 2:00 PM on September 9th. All of our countrymen, witnessing this great event, will know that the citizens of Shanghai have transformed their patriotic enthusiasm into the strength to save the country. However, the flight of a sparrow cannot be compared to the aspiration of a swan. To build national air defense, we must unite the whole country, contribute our financial resources to the best of our ability, and provide as much as possible. In this way, we can prepare the heavens, prevent enemy spying, and escape the abyss of destruction. We hope that you will rise up in response, aspire to the skies, wipe out humiliation, and rescue the weak. We deeply rely on you. We are sending this telegram with urgency, looking forward to your response. The China Aviation Association bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Stopped Shipping from Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Separate Letters to Each Line Stating Responsibility</p>
<p>Other Passengers and Cargoes are Loaded and Transported as Usual</p>
<p>The medicine stores and hotel division in this city, in order to oppose the Shantou gang's deduction of the strength and bottom water of the hotel, announced a strike from yesterday. The Shantou gang, Hongtai, completely stopped loading with passengers and cargo. The medicine industry trade union sent separate letters to the managers of each line stating the responsibility for the strike, and organized a temporary committee to take charge of everything. Other passengers and cargoes from each gang are still loaded and transported as usual. The situation of each branch is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Statement of Responsibility</p>
<p>The Medicine Industry Trade Union sent separate letters to the managers of each medicine line yesterday, stating the responsibility for the strike. The original letter is recorded as follows: Dear Sirs, I have found that the case of the Shantou gang businessmen Hong Taixing, Lin Yiji, Datongchang, etc., for deducting the strength and bottom water of the hotel, has been repeatedly dispatched by the association. Lin Yiji and Datongchang need merchants and have made considerable statements, waiting to be resolved after informing the Shantou Chamber of Commerce. However, Hong Zizhao, a businessman from Hong Taixing, has a tough attitude. In addition to deducting the bottom water, he also changed the unit strength of 14 yuan within the prescribed limit to the calculation of foreign codes, deliberately destroying the workers' livelihood. This has reached its extreme, and if we do not deal with it severely, the cunning and stubbornness of the businessman will not be able to warn him in the future. Therefore, a temporary meeting was convened and resolved, and it was decided that from the 10th of this month, all the shops and inns would be notified to stop transporting Hong Taixing's medicinal materials, and to petition the party and government agencies to mediate, and to send a letter to the same industry office to find out and order a statement. In addition to the responsibility issue of stopping the transportation this time, I would like to ask you to inspect and take care of the Hehe.</p>
<p>Each Gang is As Usual</p>
<p>After the workers of the industry announced the strike yesterday, Hong Taixing's passengers and goods from the Shantou gang completely stopped transporting. However, passengers and goods from Guangzhou, Xiamen, Tianjin, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Tongzhou, and other gangs were transported as usual. The Shantou gang, in addition to Hong Taixing, the others such as Lin Yiji Datongchang, etc., were not affected.</p>
<p>Departing Investigation</p>
<p>Regarding all foreign and internal affairs during the strike period, it is recommended that the union directors Sang Yutang, supervisor Weng Dongsheng, and the directors of each share form a temporary committee to preside over the meeting, and send Li Minghua and other 17 people as investigators to set off separately to investigate whether there is any destructive behavior in the same industry.</p>
<p>[P Zhabei Silk Factory Still Stopped Work Yesterday&gt;</p>
<p>Labor and Management Agreed to Start the Car This Morning</p>
<p>After the labor dispute in the silk factory in this city was resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau, the factories temporarily stopped the car in order to avoid unnecessary losses due to the repeated misunderstandings of the workers. Yesterday, except for the five factories in the concession area that fully resumed work, only two factories in Zhabei District started work, and the rest stopped work uniformly. The labor and management have negotiated on the method, and it is difficult to predict whether they will start work this morning.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Consultation</p>
<p>The Six District Sericulture Industry Trade Union has been repeatedly misunderstood by the workers, causing repeated twists and turns. The factory has taken the opportunity to temporarily stop the car. If this is delayed, it will inevitably affect the livelihood of the workers. Therefore, in order to seek a quick solution, yesterday, the board members Yang Gengdi, Yuan Yunlong, Wu Suzhen, etc., were specially dispatched to the Silk Industry Trade Union to discuss the methods with Chairman Shen Huachen, requesting that each factory be notified to start work as usual, so as to avoid additional complications. Shen Junyun immediately persuaded each factory to start the car as usual, and the trade union earnestly persuaded the workers to enter the factory to work, so as not to cause further twists and turns and increase the losses of both parties.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work in the Concession</p>
<p>Taixing, Jingwei, Yuanhetaiji, Xiangyuan on Gansu Road, and Yuyuan on Guoqing Road, the five silk factories on Alabashito Road in the concession area, were also affected by the workers' strike in Zhabei District. At the time, the factories gathered to discuss and decided that the production system issue should be submitted to the authorities for handling, and explained to the workers, so the Jingwei and Xiangyuan factories had already resumed work the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, the other three factories also completed the repair of engines, furnaces, and other machines, and started work as usual. All the workers have also entered the factory to work, and the order is very good.</p>
<p>Situation in Zhabei</p>
<p>The Chu Xin, Hong Tai, Yuan Xing, and other 21 silk factories along Changan Road, Guangfu Road, and Xin Zhabei Meiyuan Road in Zhabei District did not start the car yesterday morning and postponed the start. Only the Xie Xing on Changan Road and the Ruilun on Guangfu Road were not affected and worked as usual. The other 19 factories were shut down.</p>

<p>Notice to Start the Car</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Trade Union, at the request of the Six District Sericulture Trade Union, notified the 19 silk factories including Xie Xing separately yesterday, so that the workers could enter the factory to resume work from this morning.</p>
<p>Trade Union's Opinion</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the union said that the workers originally intended to resume work uniformly the day before yesterday, but because each factory did not start the car, they could not resume work. Although the labor and management have now negotiated and decided to persuade them to start the car to work, the opinions of each factory are not unified, and half of them lack raw materials. The persons in charge have gone to Wuxi and Yixing to collect cocoons. It is difficult to predict whether each factory can start the car uniformly. However, the workers are simple-minded. As long as one or two factories do not start the car, it will inevitably affect each factory, so I hope that each factory will also understand the workers' difficulties and not cause additional complications, so as not to cause new disputes.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce's Statement</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, Shen Huachen, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, told the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency yesterday that the workers' strike was initially due to the implementation of the production system in each factory, which has been resolved by the government. Now, after the workers' resumption of work, they have been repeatedly misunderstood and evolved into a repeated strike. It is the instigation of the disruptors. The Chamber of Commerce has decided to go to the Social Affairs Bureau within the day to request the party and government agencies to issue a joint notice to set a date for the resumption of work, and to notify the Public Security Bureau to strictly suppress the disruptors and send police to protect the resumption of work.</p>
<h3 id="e113">China Production and Sales Joint Company: Developing a National Goods Plan <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Cooperation in Production and Promotion</p>
<p>Cooperation in Economy and Talent</p>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Joint Company, initiated by Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Wu Zhihao, a leader in the national goods industry, representatives to the Chicago Exposition, and figures from Shanghai's financial and industrial sectors, aims to establish organized development for national goods and defend China's economic barriers. Recently, the preparatory office of the company has drafted a summary of the business plan procedures to be carried out, which is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Conducting Business: The company conducts business with the aim of cultivating the strength of national goods promotion and creating three major lifelines: increasing production and improving exports. The procedures are divided into three major lifelines: (1) Cooperation in production and promotion; (2) Cooperation in production and economy; (3) Cooperation in economy and talent.</p>
<p>Production and Promotion: The work of cooperation in production and promotion must be based on joint factories and the creation of promotional forces. The joint factory is the work that should be focused on during the preparatory stage, and then engage in the work of creating promotional forces. Creating promotional forces is based on two major principles: developing domestic and foreign business of national goods. These principles, according to the description of the same business procedures, are divided into three types: promotion ordering firms, promotion spot firms, and promotion stores, which are implemented step by step according to the situation and needs of the environment. At the same time, contact existing national goods companies. The procedures for carrying out business should be divided into three areas: (1) For those belonging to this port, plan and coordinate with others to establish national goods stores, the so-called chain stores, or spider web-like stores, in order to obtain statistics on the distribution of national goods consumers and statistics on the popularity of national goods, hold regional national goods exhibitions, and invite established national goods companies to coordinate; (2) For those belonging to other ports, plan and coordinate with others to establish promotion ordering or promotion spot firms, first take the residence of the representatives who participated in the Chicago Exposition this time, or the land within their sphere of influence, as a pilot area, and then expand the scope to the chambers of commerce in various places or the backbone figures in various places, and then plan to establish national goods stores or national goods companies, and contact those who have already established national goods companies; (3) For those belonging to foreign countries, the founders currently attending the Chicago Exposition plan to organize national goods promotion firms, first take Chicago as a pilot area, and then gradually expand the scope, and then plan to establish national goods stores or national goods companies. If this promotion network can be used well, its greatest effectiveness will be enough to resist the intrusion of economic forces and build a barrier for the country in economic defense. Even from the perspective of its smallest effectiveness, it is enough to gather the consumer power of the people, thereby attracting economic strength to coordinate with the production sector, increase the quantity of goods, and improve the quality of products.</p>
<p>Production and Economy: The work of cooperation in production and economy must be based on joint financial circles and manufacturing plants. Joint financial circles are the work that should be focused on during the preparatory stage. When this work has been substantially completed, then engage in obtaining accurate statistics on the popularity of factory-made products. Based on the statistics of this popularity, on the one hand, engage in uniting banks that are enthusiastic about cooperating with national goods, and on the other hand, plan to organize financial institutions that assist national goods, in order to assist manufacturing plants, so that they can increase production and improve products. In general, any factory has the heart to increase production and improve products, but it is trapped by economic reasons, which makes the mind and strength contrary. Even bankers have the heart to cooperate with national goods, but they often suffer because of the lack of understanding of the value of national goods, thus reducing their enthusiasm for cooperation. If there is an institution that can make banks believe, and this institution has the great ability to promote national goods, and is willing to guarantee banks' cooperation with national goods, and there are statistics on the accurate popularity of national goods for reference, then no bank will be unwilling to engage in this business. The principle of bank business is to seek stable interest. If its mortgage can ensure that the specified interest is obtained, and the recovery of the mortgage is very stable, then from the perspective of the principle of business, it is in line with the principle and far better than the most practical and stable business of credit lending. The work of uniting banks that are enthusiastic about assisting national goods must be summarized into a stable method according to the above views, arouse the attention of the banking community, and engage in organizing national goods public warehouses. The goods in the warehouse can be directly mortgaged to the bank by the factory introduced by the company. The financial institutions that organize and assist national goods plan to adopt the organization to promote national goods savings associations, or labor-capital mutual aid savings associations. The organization law and effectiveness of promoting national goods savings associations have been detailed in the business plan for building national goods. As for the labor-capital mutual aid savings association, it is a new route to create labor-capital cooperation. It is not only a financial institution that assists national goods. If this organization can be completed, then labor-capital disputes can be resolved immediately, and all workers can become the most powerful soldiers in the production sector. This proposition has been approved by some members of the General Labor Union this year, and those on the factory side who have heard this proposition have also expressed great sympathy. According to the trend of this opinion, the labor-capital mutual aid savings association is not only a financial institution that assists national goods.</p>
<p>Talent and Economy: The work of cooperation between talent and economy is based on uniting talent and cultivating talent. The work of uniting talent must be carried out by category and organize various research institutions, and then there will be continuous contributions to both production and sales, enough to assist the cooperation in production and promotion and the cooperation in production and economy. For example, the improvement of a product must require its person to have a comparative understanding of similar products and have the academic ability and plan to improve it. However, this kind of talent cannot be hired by a factory with weak resources, or barely hired. However, whether it can be given appropriate command to make the most of its strengths is also a question. Other talents with talent and learning suffer from having no place to display themselves, and the organization that needs talent also suffers from having no place to find them, resulting in two incompatible situations, causing intangible losses to the progress of human resources and productivity in our country. Also, if a person with invention ability cannot obtain economic assistance, this ability cannot be realized or developed rapidly, resulting in a worthless abandonment. People with economic strength, although they have the idea of building a career, also cannot meet the right person, so that this idea cannot become a reality. As for cultivating talent, it is an urgent task for our country today. Furthermore, in terms of the quality and spirit of our people's talent, intelligence, diligence, hard work, and courage to struggle, it is indeed like a fertile field suitable for planting, but no one cultivates it. If it is cultivated, its achievements are really immeasurable. This is evident from the shooting performance of the Chinese team in the Shanghai International Business Corps Rifle Competition. If the work of uniting talent and cultivating talent can be carried out in an organized manner, and then cooperated with the economy, then there will be no abandoned talent and no wasted land. If we talk about it to the fullest extent, then with the lack of productivity of our country's land and the superiority of the quality of the people's talent, if we can do our best to use it to reach the realm of self-sufficiency, it is not absolutely impossible. Today's reliance on foreign goods and oppression by the enemy is our country's self-abandonment. Chapter by chapter, section by section, detailed descriptions, such as propaganda agencies and agency agencies, are extremely important. The former is the hub for supporting the progress of various cooperation, and the latter is the source for planning various raw material factories and developing agricultural and mining industries. To the fullest extent, it is a plan to resist economic aggression, cultivate production strength, and unite agriculture, industry, and commerce to fight against foreign countries. If we can proceed step by step, then after a few years, the foreign goods that are active in the market today will lose their opportunity to invade under the strict barriers.</p>
<h3 id="e114">General Association of Overseas Chinese Requests Restoration of Approval <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau replied that it should wait for a factual report and forward it. It is hoped that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will be directly presented with the request for assistance and maintenance. The Global Overseas Chinese General Association of this city has now received an approval order from the Social Affairs Bureau. The original text is as follows: Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Approval, Social Character No. 1457. The applicant, the Global Overseas Chinese General Association, submitted a document stating that it was complying with the order to temporarily suspend activities and still requested that the feelings of overseas Chinese be respected, and that a way be found to maintain the transfer and review for handling the reasons. After reviewing, it was claimed that the association had declared its record with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Party Department in accordance with the law, but it was inappropriate to carry out preparatory organization before approval was obtained. In addition, the collection of donations must be submitted to the party and government organs for approval. The 61st Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee has already resolved to notify the implementation. Article 8, Paragraph 4 of the Regulations on Supervision of Social Organizations in this city also has clear provisions. The association cannot be unique. The association has already followed the order to stop all activities and should wait for a factual report. The request for assistance and relief to maintain continuity is a matter of overseas Chinese affairs and should still be submitted to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for approval. This approval.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Relieving the Sale of Chinese Tea to Russia <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Banking Industry Has Agreed to Grant Loans</p>
<p>Dagon News Agency said that the export of Chinese tea is a major commodity of our country. In recent years, due to poor baking and lack of decoration, it has been subjected to dumping and crowding out by Indian and Japanese tea. The business has plummeted, and Chinese tea merchants have suffered heavy losses and have difficulties in turnover. The tea leaves accumulated in this city are huge. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in view of this, convened a Chinese tea conference to discuss relief methods. When Chinese tea is sold to Russia, it is also a large commodity. However, Russian merchants have never traded in cash when purchasing Chinese tea, and it takes a year to pay the money. On the Chinese tea merchant side, due to the sluggish business and economic difficulties in recent years, they are unable to lend money, so the sale of Chinese tea to Russia has been suspended invisibly, and they dare not easily conclude a deal. The Trade Bureau submitted the above situation to the Ministry of Industry for approval. After the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance discussed it once, it was decided that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry would send personnel to contact the Shanghai banking industry for loan methods. As a result, it was decided that after the tea merchants from China and Russia conclude a tea sales transaction, the Russian merchants will be given a one-year repayment period. The money will be temporarily paid by the Shanghai banking industry to the Chinese tea merchants. When the one-year period expires, the Russian merchants must repay the bank in full, including principal and interest. Yesterday, Guo Weibai, director of the International Trade Bureau, claimed that the plan had been agreed by the banking industry, and the Russian Merchants Association had also started to handle the goods. If this is carried out, the law is good and the intention is beautiful. On the one hand, it can promote the sale of Chinese tea to Russia, and on the other hand, it can dredge the financing of Chinese tea merchants. Otherwise, Russian merchants will inevitably purchase goods from India and Japan, and the loss of Chinese tea merchants' newly delayed accumulation is even more unimaginable.</p>

<p>For the Construction of a Meeting Hall</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association purchased a private house at 572 Beile Road, French Concession, in June of the 18th year of the Republic of China, and converted it into an association. Since then, new members who applied to join the association have been required to pay 50 silver dollars each for the construction of the association's foundation. For several years, new members have complied with the regulations. This year, because Cha Nanqiang lawyer opposed this construction fee, he repeatedly submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating that the above-mentioned donation was not included in the regulations of the Shanghai Bar Association. The Ministry of Justice ordered the Jiangsu Higher Court to order the Shanghai Bar Association to submit a factual report for verification and handling. At that time, when Cha Nanqiang lawyer joined the association, he did not pay this construction fund, and he was allowed to join the association immediately. However, the association believed that future members who joined the association could refuse to pay, so the Standing Committee continued to submit a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, saying that it intended to build a meeting hall that could accommodate more than 1,000 people on the current association, and each member who joined the association should pay 50 yuan for the construction fund, requesting the Ministry of Law to file it. The Ministry of Law has now approved and issued an instruction that all new members who request to join the association must still pay 50 yuan for the construction of the association, and it is approved for filing. It has already been instructed to the Shanghai Bar Association to check.</p>
<h3 id="e121">General Assembly of Accountants Association (Continued) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(4) Opening Remarks: Chairman Xie Lin said, distinguished guests, representatives of various associations, today is the opening day of the National Accountants Association. I am very grateful for the representatives of various agencies and groups to come to the meeting to guide us. There are currently representatives from eight accountants' trade unions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Wuhan, Jiujiang, Guangdong, and Shandong. It can be seen that they attach importance to this meeting. Now I will respectfully speak about the past experience of accountants in our country, the relationship with society, and the necessity of organizing this association. The system of accountants originated in Europe and the United States and was introduced to China. In short, it recognizes accounting as a specialized discipline, and regards those who have this discipline as specialists, and makes specialized professions. The knowledge of accounting is usually nothing more than managing accounts. However, whether managing accounts can be done properly is easy to say but difficult to do. In general, a business has a situation, and the organization of its accounting must be different accordingly. Moreover, in this era of fierce competition in industry and commerce, such as the amount of cost, the rise and fall of management, and the surplus or deficit of business, all depend on the accounting system to express it, and the future plan relies on accounting to standardize it. Therefore, the discipline of accounting is not only necessary for the industrial and commercial circles, but even becomes a specialized technology. For example, building a house, in the past, summoning a tile carpenter was enough to do it. Now the construction has progressed, and high-rise buildings are often dozens of stories high. All facilities require academic knowledge, and every brick and every piece of wood has physics, so there are so-called engineers who are born in response to the times. There are also various distinctions among engineers, some specializing in roads, some specializing in bridges, and some specializing in construction. Others, such as physicians who are divided into internal medicine and surgery, and lawyers who are divided into criminal and civil affairs, each have their own expertise, which is also the same situation. Our accountants are also equal to engineers, physicians, and lawyers, and not only engage in ordinary accounting, but also have specialized skills, such as government accounting, factory accounting, bank accounting, railway accounting, cost accounting, and statistics, etc., each of which is a specialty. In October of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, convened a conference on industry and commerce. The proposals of various provinces to reform industrial and commercial accounting and to conduct industrial and commercial statistics accounted for many, which shows that accounting affairs have been emphasized by the whole country, and it is also the responsibility that the members of our association in various places should bear for the industrial and commercial circles. The accounting system in our country began in the 7th year of the Republic of China. First, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the old Beijing government promulgated the Interim Regulations for Accountants. Until the 19th year, the National Government graduated, or taught as a professor, and served in a major accounting position in a government agency or a company with a capital of more than 100,000 yuan for more than two years, and was qualified by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to obtain an accountant certificate. It is nothing more than the meaning of emphasizing both learning and experience. It is found that there are currently 1,050 approved accountants. There are already public associations established in various provinces, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Wuhan, Jiujiang, Guangdong, Shandong, etc., with more than 500 members. The duties given to accountants in the regulations are the organization of accounting, the management of accounting, the audit of accounting, the sorting of accounting, the liquidation of accounting, the certification of accounting, and the appraisal of accounting. It is also stipulated that accountants can be inspectors, liquidators, bankruptcy trustees, will executors, other trustees, and litigation events. The court makes judgments based on the accountant's appraisal report, which has become a proper way, which shows the needs of society. Before our country had accountants, when foreign merchants came to China to do business, accounting affairs were handled by accountants from their own countries. Therefore, there are also a lot of foreign accountants in Shanghai. Their original names are either bookkeepers, or auditors, or accounting experts. Companies and banks in our country have entrusted them. Since recent years, there have been more and more accountants opening businesses in our country, so it is no longer necessary to entrust foreign accountants. In addition, the huge relationship between lawsuits involving non-treaty nationals and our country's courts is also great. Today's business is becoming more and more heavy, which shows its huge relationship even more. Today's meeting is an association for the organization of the National Accountants Association. There are two reasons why it is necessary to have this organization: (1) Mutual assistance in business. Because the business of accountants in our country is still in its infancy, and members are scattered in various places, it is really necessary to help each other in performing business. Therefore, this association is organized as a hub for research and discussion, so that the ability of our accountants can be improved, and the industrial and commercial circles can benefit more. (2) Exchange of knowledge. Because our country has a vast territory, accountants serve the society, and the customs and organizations of the industrial and commercial circles in various places are not clear to each other. Not only can it facilitate the business of the same industry, but it can also contribute to the government as a reference for legislation. It is hoped that the public associations and their members in various places will adhere to this main purpose and maintain the purpose of this association. The guests present today are either the supervisors of accountants, or the guiding bodies of social undertakings, or the leaders of the industrial and commercial circles, or the groups of the academic circles. We must understand that the duties of accountants have a close relationship with society. Regardless of whether this meeting is adjourned, please give practical guidance. I cannot express my sincere hope enough. On behalf of the association today, I would like to thank the guests for their presence and congratulate the development of the accountants' associations in various places and the success of this association. (5) Jiang Hao, representative of the Central Party Department, Tao Baichuan, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Wu Huanru, representative of the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Zhinan, representative of the Municipal Security Office, Lin Kanghou, representative of the Banking Branch of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Qin Runqing, representative of the Money Industry Association, Shen Junru, representative of the Bar Association, Xu Naili, representative of the National Medical Association Federation, and various guests and journalists spoke one after another (the speeches are omitted). Chairman Xi Yushu delivered a thank you speech.

<h3 id="e122">Shanghai North Station Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>=Ministry of Railways Sends Counselor Zhang Weici to Open the Key=</p>
<p>=Director Huang Boqiao Personally Conducts the Flag-Raising Ceremony=</p>
<p>The four-story building of Shanghai North Station of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration was destroyed by Japanese aircraft during the January 28 Incident last year, leaving only the foundation. After the ceasefire, the Railway Administration immediately found another building to serve as a temporary office, and in mid-August, it submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways to rebuild the upper floor. Later, the proposal to relocate the station was put on hold due to the city government's proposal to relocate the station. Later, due to the serious national crisis, the Ministry ordered a temporary suspension of the station relocation, so the old matter was re-examined and construction started in early June. Now it has been fully completed, and an inauguration ceremony was held yesterday afternoon, and guests from all walks of life were invited to visit. The details of the situation are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Engineering Notes <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The location of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration was at the Shanghai North Station. Originally, it was a four-story building, 60.5 meters long and 24.7 meters wide, covering a total area of 1,494.55 square meters. It was divided into 76 rooms and was built according to the blueprints designed by the British engineer, West Repley. The corners of the building on three sides were made of Qingdao granite. The large walls above the first floor were supported by steel columns, and all the wall foundations, column bases, and floors were constructed with foreign cement and aggregate. The building was completed on the 20th day of May in the first year of the Xuantong reign of the late Qing Dynasty. The total cost was 329,448 silver dollars. Not only was it magnificent, but the materials used were also extremely strong. Therefore, after more than 20 years, it still showed no signs of changing its original state. Unexpectedly, it became scorched earth during the January 28th Incident. On January 29th of the 21st year, the second afternoon of the incident, Japanese aircraft circled over the North Station, dropping bombs. The Administration's office building, warehouse, and newly built annex offices were successively hit and caught fire. The raging flames soared into the sky and lasted all night. All books, documents, instruments, and implements were reduced to ashes, with losses amounting to 500,000 yuan. On May 23rd, the North Station area was taken over by this Bureau, and the Engineering Department immediately supervised the demolition of the destroyed station building. Initially, it was planned to demolish only down to the third floor and repair and use the second floor. However, after the rubble on the second floor was cleared, it was observed that the brick and stone work was beyond repair, and it was decided to demolish it completely. As for the ground floor, although there were several places where the brick walls, stone arches, and door and window floors were damaged, they were not seriously affected, so it was planned to repair and use them, and add another floor on top. This proposal was submitted to the Ministry of Railways and approved on August 13th of the 21st year with Directive No. 3884 of the Engineering Department. At that time, the Shanghai Municipal Government proposed relocating the Shanghai North Station in order to promote the prosperity of the Zhabei area and promote the development of the city center. The Railway Ministry instructed the Committee for the Construction of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to repeatedly send personnel to Shanghai to negotiate. As a result, because the North Station's location was in the center of the Zhabei District, and there was no room for future development of the two railway lines, and it was especially important to the overall plan of the Shanghai city center, it was decided to accept the Shanghai Municipal Government's suggestion and select a site south of Dava Road and north of Xiangyin Road, along the southwest 1,800 meters of Zhongshan Road, as the location for the passenger terminal. A site west of Zhongshan Road and east of Zhenru Road, along the existing railway line, would be used as the intermodal terminal. The proposal to rebuild the Shanghai North Station was thus shelved. In March of the 22nd year, the Ministry of Railways, due to the seriousness of the national crisis, ordered the cessation of the station relocation. The Bureau, mindful that the Shanghai North Station was a matter of concern for both Chinese and foreigners, felt that it was inappropriate to leave this ruin standing for a long time, giving travelers a bad impression. Moreover, because passengers lacked a place to wait and rest, they usually crowded under the awnings around the ticket office, and</p>
<p>felt very pained. Therefore, it was decided to repair the lower floor of the building and rebuild a central part of the upper floor, so that the Traffic Department could move in to work, and passengers could have a place to wait and rest. This was submitted to the Ministry of Railways and approved on April 14th of the 22nd year with Directive No. 11506 of the T Department. Subsequently, the architect Zhao Shen of the Huayi Architectural Firm was entrusted to revise the original plan of the Engineering Department and provide drawings. The Engineering Department then invited bids for the project. At 3:00 PM on May 1st, the bidding was opened publicly in the Bureau. Commissioner Huang Hongdao was dispatched by the Ministry of Railways to supervise. A total of 17 companies submitted bids. The lowest bid was from the Tao Hongtai Construction Company, with a bid of 47,750 yuan in national currency. The next lowest was from the Qiao Yu and Construction Company, with a bid of 49,850 yuan in national currency. The next lowest was from the Zhongnan Construction Company, with a bid of 50,146 yuan in national currency. It was considered that although this project was not very large, it was a public place, and extra attention had to be paid to its appearance and safety. Therefore, the qualifications and experience of the construction companies had to be carefully considered. Among the companies with lower bids, the Zhongnan Construction Company had undertaken major construction projects for the Shanghai Municipal Engineering Bureau, the Bank of China, and others over the years, with each project reaching 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, and had owner satisfaction certificates, which was most suitable. Moreover, the price difference was not too large. Therefore, after consulting with the Commissioner dispatched by the Ministry to supervise the opening of bids, it was decided to award the project to the company. The contract was formally signed on May 17th. The supervision and guidance of the construction work was entrusted to architect Zhao Shen, and the Ministry of Railways was notified for approval and record. The renovated Shanghai North Station building would mostly be used for the Traffic Department's offices. The center of the hall would house an information desk and reception area, with an electric standard clock above it. The rest would be used for first and second-class passenger waiting rooms, luggage storage rooms, and restaurants. Negotiations were held with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to install six public telephones in the south of the hall (which could also be used for long-distance calls). A model book stall would be set up in the southwest corner, and other stations would be handled in the same way in the future. At the same time, the surroundings of the station would be rearranged to create a clean and beautiful environment. The building construction started on May 17th. It was delayed by rain in the middle, and the entire project was completed on August 25th. Commissioner Huang Hongdao of the Ministry of Railways was dispatched on August 31st to inspect and accept the project, together with Mo Heng, the Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Bureau, and Desford, the Chief of the Engineering Department. Although it was not possible to fully restore the old appearance, it was a great improvement compared to the devastated scene after the fire.</p>

<p>The following people visited the station yesterday: Minister of Communications Zhu Jia驊, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways Yu Yan, President of Jiaotong University Li Zhaobao, Acting Garrison Commander of Songhu Zhang Xiang, Director of the Central Mint Lu Xuepu, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Director of the Security Department Yang Hu, Guo Shun, Ren Chuanbang, Hu Pu'an, and about a hundred reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Completion Ceremony <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The completion and key-opening ceremony was held at 2:00 PM. First, the municipal military band played music. The Director of the Two Railways Bureau, Huang Boqiao, personally performed the flag-raising ceremony. Then, Counselor Zhang Weici of the Ministry of Railways opened the lock. The simple and solemn ceremony came to an end. Director Huang and all the staff led guests from all walks of life into the station to visit the offices on each floor and explain everything. After walking around for a week, they returned to the ground floor for refreshments and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Hopes of the Authorities <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Two Railways Bureau, and Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director, expressed their hopes for the completion of the restored Shanghai North Station, saying that the reconstruction of the Shanghai North Station was the result of the January 28th Incident, and the January 28th Incident was the result of the September 18th Incident. Therefore, today's reception for all sectors to visit the completed reconstruction of the Shanghai North Station does not mean we are celebrating. However, there are a few points that I would like to take this opportunity to report, hoping that everyone will have a certain understanding after visiting the site, and then give us guidance and assistance. First, what we want to report is that the railway is mainly based on business, and the state-owned railway is mainly based on commercialization. According to the current organization of the Railway Bureau, the center of business operation is in the Traffic Department. Therefore, we still set up the Traffic Department in the Shanghai North Station, the center of the two railways. The Traffic Department has recently revised its organization, reorganized the Document Section into the General Affairs Section, the Dispatch Section into the Transportation Section, and the Commercial Section into the Business Section. Under this Business Section, there are also the Document Stock, Passenger Transport Stock, Freight Stock, Compilation and Investigation Stock, Public Relations Stock, and Catering Stock. At the same time, starting today, the Business Office recently established at 407 Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai, also belongs to the Business Section of the Traffic Department, and is almost a branch office. In the near future, we also want to have the same setup in the southern part of Shanghai. We want to thoroughly realize the commercialization of state-owned railways consistently inside and out. Second, what we want to report is that the railway serves the people, and should mainly provide the public with full convenience and safety. Therefore, in addition to trains, we also strive to rectify the equipment at the stations. We will first designate several large stations as model stations to refresh them. The Shanghai North Station is the center of the two railways, and Shanghai, where it is located, occupies the most important position in our country's economy. There are about 300,000 passengers traveling to and from each month.</p>
<p>However, since the station building was burned down, passengers have long lacked a place to wait, and third and fourth-class passengers lack adequate waiting facilities. Now that we have restored the Shanghai North Station, we have divided a part of the ground floor for first and second-class passengers, and used awnings with windows at the back of the station building to set up seats and add new-style men's and women's restrooms for third and fourth-class passengers. We have also set up a special luggage storage area, so that passengers who only have a short stay in Shanghai can temporarily deposit their luggage without having to carry it with them to avoid burdens. We have a special agreement with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to install public telephones, which can also be used for long-distance calls. In addition, wired and wireless telegraphs and postal services are planned to be added to the station in succession after consultation with the transportation authorities for direct delivery. In addition, the North Station is an important station for the two railways, and the passengers and vehicles entering and leaving the station are the most crowded. If there is no proper management method, the order will be chaotic. Therefore, this time we restored the Shanghai North Station, and at the same time, we will thoroughly rectify the traffic inside and outside the station. As far as the inside of the station is concerned, in the past, the routes for passengers and luggage carts were mixed and not separated. Now, they are separately stipulated to make them orderly. Outside the station, we have also demarcated parking areas for automobiles and rickshaws, and deployed police posts along the routes so that passengers and vehicles can travel according to their destinations without colliding and causing danger. In addition, there are no public restaurants in the stations of the two railways. This time, the North Station will be restored, and it is planned to run it immediately so that passengers traveling to and from can get economical and clean food at any time. In addition, the expansion of the rain shed platform at Nanjing Xiaguan Station and the repair of other major stations will also be completed at the same time. Third, what we want to report is that railway transportation is based on speed and reliability. Therefore, what we are most committed to is to make the train arrive on time at the prescribed time. Once this is done, we will then seek to shorten the driving time within the prescribed time. Part of the train schedule changed on June 1 of this year was to achieve this goal. For example, the Beijing-Shanghai daytime express train was shortened from the longest eight hours and fifteen minutes to six hours and fifty minutes. Freight trains have been changed from indefinite departures to eight times a day. The Shanghai-Hangzhou freight trains have also been changed from once every other day to every day. Now we are retesting the traction of locomotives, and from September 1st, we will shorten the running time of various trains again. For example, the first and second passenger trains and the Beijing-Zhabei express trains will be reduced by 30 minutes (from Beijing to Shanghai, it now only takes six hours and twenty minutes), the fifth Beijing-Shanghai night express train will be reduced by 30 minutes, and the 11th and 12th Shanghai-Beijing third and fourth-class slow trains will have their running time reduced by one hour and fifteen minutes and two hours respectively. The 301st and 302nd domestic intermodal express trains will be reduced by half an hour and 35 minutes respectively. The shortening of freight trains is even greater. For example, the 311th Beijing-Shanghai freight train will be reduced by 15 hours and eight minutes compared to before, and the 312th freight train will be reduced by 17 hours and twelve minutes (the shortest time for freight trains from Beijing to Shanghai used to be 19 hours and 37 minutes, and now the shortest is only 16 hours and 25 minutes). In addition, mixed passenger and freight trains have been added, so that sporadic freight cars or loaded cars that have not been taken away by freight trains can be transported at any time along the way, which is especially fast. But we are not satisfied with this. In the future, we will continue to shorten the time as much as possible within the possible range. To summarize the three points reported above, our only purpose is to use a reasonable method with twelve points of determination to operate the railway and fulfill the mission of serving the people. However, those in charge are confused, and onlookers are clear. Therefore, we want to take the opportunity of repairing the Shanghai North Station to invite leaders from all walks of life to see a part of our facilities on the spot and listen to our brief report. After that, they will give us instructions and assistance anytime and anywhere, so that we can improve what we have not done well and make up for what we have not done. This is what we desperately desire.</p>

<p>=Haimen Huaize Hall Pharmacy Owner=</p>
<p>=Wang Hazhang has been prosecuted in the case=</p>
<p>On the 25th of last month, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, at Yutai Medicinal Material Store at 151 Xiangguajie outside Xiaodongmen in Nanshi, and Lida Pharmacy at 1 Hengxing Xili on the opposite side of the road, were found to have set up a wholesale agency for counterfeit secret Liu Shen Wan and American Ginseng medicines of the Lei Yunshang Songfen Hall Pharmacy, and arrested Yang Zhengming, Gui Hanjiang, Tan Youcai, Ji Ruiding, and other four people. On the spot, they seized a lot of the above-mentioned counterfeit drugs, and evidence of the imitation, and brought them back to the team for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Gui Hanjiang also confessed that his accomplice, Wang Hazhang from Haimen, also falsely produced Lei Yunshang's military powder, Biewen Pills, Sha medicine, toad cake pills, and other medicines, and sold them in the Huaize Hall Pharmacy in Haimen. After the leader of the Lu team according to the confession, he ordered the detective team leader Chen Caifu to lead the detectives Mao Gongzhao, Zeng Wanli, and Li Guiting, and others, to take documents to the Haimen Public Security Bureau the other day, added police, and went to the Huaize Hall Pharmacy in Changxing Town, Haimen, arrested the shop owner Ningbo native Wang Hazhang, and copied out the Biewen Pills, military powder, Sha medicine, toad cake pills, imitation medicine bottles, and escorted them by ship to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Wang Hazhang's confession, he is 68 years old, from Ningbo, lived in Changxing Town, Haimen, and opened the Huaize Hall Pharmacy. Four years ago, the military powder Sha medicine toad cake pills and other medicine of Lei Yunshang was filled with Jiangbei, which greatly affected the business of our brand's medicine. For the sake of livelihood, I had no choice but to inquire around, and then learned that there were various medicine bottles and imitation medicine bottles made of Lei Yunshang in Jiangbei, and used my brand's medicines at home to store and sell, in order to maintain life. This matter has only been a year or so, but Lei Yunshang wants to ban counterfeit products, and must fundamentally solve it. First, the Jiangxi kiln must be banned from burning counterfeit magnetic bottles, and Jiangbei must be informed of the investigation and ban. For the sake of morality, it is not convenient for those who sell Lei Yunshang's medicine bottles and imitation medicine bottles.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>to be exposed. If Lei Yunshang is lenient to me, I am willing to help him ban it in various stores in Jiangbei. After the leader of the Lu team verified the confession, he said that Wang's violation of the trademark was the same in everything, and should be prepared to be sent to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>=The first phase of exploration work is completed=</p>
<p>=Will explore the most dangerous places in the world=</p>
<p>Young explorer Chen Yiqin arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 2nd of this month, and stayed at his friend's house on North Sichuan Road. In recent days, Chen's relatives and friends have hosted banquets to wash Chen's feet and see him off, and the entertainment is very busy. Mr. Chen took the Taikoo Company's Xining ship back to Hong Kong yesterday morning. Before leaving, he told the reporter of the Daily News that this southern return is only temporary). Chen himself claimed (one person, the first phase of exploration work has come to an end. Although he has endured all kinds of hardships, the research results have made him feel very happy spiritually. After arriving in Hong Kong, in about a month or so, he will edit the first phase of exploration results into a book for his compatriots, and then solicit courageous and adventurous comrades to continue planning the second phase of exploration work. After the second phase is completed, he will make a third phase plan in the future, and plan to explore the most dangerous places in the world. In short, I have determined my policy, and no matter what kind of obstacles or dangers I encounter, I will never change my original intention, and I will vow to achieve my goal before I stop. The reporter noted that Mr. Chen is from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, and his father, Chen Chi, is a giant merchant in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Mr. Chen has ten younger brothers and sisters, all of whom have great ambitions, so there is an organization of an exploration team.</p>

<p>Because of conflict, he angered the police officer, and the preliminary hearing said that the behavior was improper. At about 9:00 p.m. the night before, in the Lukiazai area of Guangqi Road in the city, a well-dressed young man suddenly put his arm around the neck of a modern woman, talking and walking there, looking very happy. The woman was wearing a fashionable long cheongsam with blue flowers and a white background, flesh-colored stockings, and high-heeled leather shoes. She was still beautiful, and was caught by the watchman Zhang Huatang of the tenth post in the area. Because their indecent behavior was detrimental to public morals, he immediately stepped forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, the young man raised his voice to the police and said, "She (referring to the woman) is my wife. We love each other. What's it to you?" Officer Zhang then scolded, "Even if you two are indeed a formal couple, you should not be hugging on the road." However, the young man still refused to accept it, so that the two sides suddenly conflicted during the conversation. For a time, a large crowd gathered to watch. At that time, a person suddenly came out and stated that they were not a formal couple, and the modern woman was not a lady from a big family, but actually the eldest sister (female servant) of a certain family on Guangqi Road. When the woman saw that their secret was revealed, her cheeks turned red in an instant. The onlookers laughed at the sight. Officer Zhang immediately ordered the person to act as a witness temporarily, and detained both the man and the woman and brought them in. The third office of the first district under its jurisdiction was preliminarily examined by the chief of the Liu office, first confirming that the witness was Zhu Xilin, 23 years old, from Wuxi. The woman was indeed a female servant of a certain family. However, I do not know the young man." Questioning the young man, he said that his name was Xu Bingwen, 23 years old, from Wuxi, and he heard that he was a partner in a cotton cloth shop on a certain major road in the British Concession. This woman is really my fiancee, etc. Questioning the woman, she said that her name was Xu Yongzhen, 16 years old, from Zhenjiang, and is currently a servant in a certain family at No. 4 Guangqi Road. The rest of the words were vague. Because their behavior was improper, they were ordered to be fined six yuan each as a warning. At this point, this interesting scene came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Lamb's Speech: Gandhi's Personality and His Movement <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge specially invited Mr. Lamb, the Secretary-General of the National Association of Indian Christian Youth, to give a speech on "Gandhi's Personality and His Movement" at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. Shen Tishang, the principal of the Mylon Middle School, translated, and Cai Zhaolu of the Bingxun Stenography Agency took shorthand notes. A very large number of people attended the lecture. The following is an excerpt of his speech:</p>
<p>It is said that Gandhi's movement problem is the most important problem in India at present. Because in the history of India, no one has been as believed and worshiped by the people as Gandhi. He pays attention to supporting the motherland and hopes that the world will be loyal and patriotic, just like Gandhi loves his motherland. Gandhi received higher education and studied law in London. After returning to China, he went to South Africa to fight for the unequal treatment of Indians in South Africa and relieve the pain of Indians. Since then, Indians have recognized Gandhi as a leader, and Gandhi himself recognizes that he has an obligation to fight together with his oppressed compatriots. There are three major forces in his struggle, (1. The Bible,) 2. (The Hindu Scriptures,) 3. (Tolstoy's philosophy.) In this struggle, he invented a basic principle, which is the secret of his success, that is, to adhere to the truth forever and unremittingly. Many people say that resistance cannot be translated into truth, but from Gandhi's character, we know that truth and passive resistance are completely different and cannot represent his mission. Passive resistance is the tool of the weak, and upholding the truth is the principle of the strong. Because passive resistance contains a provision for disobeying the law, and the bad consequences of disobeying the law can only be endured, so passive resistance is a last resort. For example, the British women's movement and the Soviet Russian Tolstoy movement represent this mission. This upholding the truth is the strong using civilized forces to resist the brutal barbaric forces, and it contains a kind of doctrine, no matter what, not taking a means of revenge. This movement is a psychological attitude, which is to recognize that the force used is barbaric, and generate power from the suffering. This power can deceive the other party's barbarism, so it is also a non-violent movement. This non-violent movement is not only a political movement, but also a religious movement. Gandhi's use of the non-violent movement has been successful in India many times. Later, the British government passed a special decree, giving local officials and police the power to arbitrarily arrest people without going through legal procedures or interrogation. Gandhi felt that his movement had no hope in politics, so he advocated three points, (1) resisting foreign cloth and promoting native cloth, (2) raising the status of untouchables, (3) political non-cooperation. However, Gandhi's non-violent movement was too slow to succeed, so it was divided into factions. There are some people who advocate assassinating government officials, and some are willing to serve in the government, but always oppose the government. Now that Gandhi has been arrested and imprisoned, everything seems to be stagnant, but compared with 1900, the nation's self-confidence, the nation's spirit of self-determination, and the spirit of struggling for the country and the nation are very swollen. There are three elements to Gandhi's greatness, (1) worshiping the truth, (2) patriotic enthusiasm, sacrificing everything for the patriotic spirit, (3) deeply believing in the spiritual elements, not relying on material things to save individuals and countries.</p>

<h3 id="e135">The Warden of Civilian Housing, Wang Zhenchang, is Subject to Disciplinary Action <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>=Due to Evidence of Self-Interest and Abuse of Power=</p>
<p>=Salary Reduction of 20% for a Period of Ten Months=</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Civil Service Disciplinary Committee issued a resolution on the disciplinary action against Wang Zhenchang, stating: The person subject to disciplinary action, Wang Zhenchang, the General Warden of Civilian Housing in Shanghai, is 34 years old, a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and resides at the Third Civilian Housing Unit, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. The aforementioned person subject to disciplinary action was impeached by the Control Yuan for cases of self-interest and abuse of power, and the case was referred to the Judicial Yuan for review. The decision of this committee is as follows: (Ruling) Wang Zhenchang's monthly salary is reduced by 20% for a period of ten months. (Facts) The person subject to disciplinary action, Wang Zhenchang, is the General Warden of Civilian Housing in Shanghai. In May of this year, Xu Haiqing, Xun Jipei, Xu Shaoqing, Han Dexiang, and others successively filed complaints with the Control Yuan, alleging corruption, dereliction of duty, self-interest, abuse of power, and oppression of civilians. The Control Yuan ordered the dispatch of a special investigator, who reported back, stating in brief: It was found that (1) Xu Haiqing of the First Civilian Housing Unit, because his rented No. 6 boiled water shop was connected to No. 21, rented by Yan Bishi, agreed with Yan Bibao of No. 21 to exchange his original rented No. 30 and No. 49. The person subject to disciplinary action had initially approved it, but because he wanted Xu Haiqing to sell the boiled water shop to his relative for 160 yuan and demanded a transfer fee of 40 yuan, he used his power to request a forced eviction, followed by arrest and detention. (2) Xun Jipei and Xu Shaoqing of the Third Civilian Housing Unit, having obtained a license from the Social Bureau to open a boiled water shop, were denied permission to operate by the person subject to disciplinary action because he failed to extort a bribe of 200 yuan. He then, under the guise of a cooperative, requested the revocation of their license. (3) Han Dexiang of the Third Civilian Housing Unit, for convening a meeting to demand rent reduction, was labeled a reactionary by the person subject to disciplinary action and reported to the Public Security Bureau, who arrested and detained him at the local court, eventually released after the court ruled for non-prosecution. It is undeniable that the person subject to disciplinary action acted arbitrarily and oppressed civilians. The Control Committee deemed that the person subject to disciplinary action had violated the law and derelicted his duties, filing an impeachment, and referred it to the Judicial Yuan for disciplinary action. (Reasons) This case is explained in three parts below: (1) Regarding Xu Haiqing: After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the person subject to disciplinary action left the civilian housing. In May, Xu Haiqing exchanged his originally rented No. 30 and No. 49 houses in the First Civilian Housing Unit with Yan Bibao's originally rented No. 21 house. The person subject to disciplinary action only took office in June of the same year. Xu Haiqing's claim that he had obtained prior permission lacks substantial proof. The investigation form he submitted was issued in December of last year, after the Social Bureau approved the return to the original numbers in August of last year, and was only used for investigating the actual residents at the time, and cannot be used as evidence of prior permission for the exchange. Xu Haiqing's original accusation is not credible. Regarding the accusation of demanding a transfer fee of 40 yuan, Xu Haiqing submitted reports to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Social Bureau in December of last year and January of this year, stating only that the person subject to disciplinary action, relying on Lü Dianqin and Sun Yunpeng, failed to purchase the boiled water shop from the merchants, hence this eviction strategy, without mentioning any bribery of 40 yuan. Furthermore, this matter was investigated by the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor at Xu Haiqing's request, who deemed that there was insufficient suspicion of a crime and ruled for non-prosecution. This point should be dismissed. However, in June of last year, the person subject to disciplinary action negotiated with Xu Haiqing to sell the boiled water shop to his relative for 160 yuan, which Xu Haiqing did not agree to. Witnesses Lü Dianqin and Sun Yunpeng testified at the meeting, vividly describing the events at the time, which cannot be considered inadmissible. Xu Haiqing, because the person subject to disciplinary action first ordered him to return to the original number, submitted a request to the Social Bureau on July 26 to stop the forced eviction. The Social Bureau issued an order to the person subject to disciplinary action, stating: "Once a resident rents a house, it must not be altered privately. If there is a valid reason and both parties agree to the exchange, it is permissible, but the procedures must be followed. The request must be submitted to the General Warden for review and approval." After receiving the order, the person subject to disciplinary action disregarded the reasons for the mutual convenience of the exchange stated by Xu Haiqing and Yan Bibao, and still ordered them to return to the original numbers, causing Xu Haiqing to submit another request to the Social Bureau, which rejected the limited eviction. The person subject to disciplinary action then submitted a request to the Social Bureau, which forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau for forced eviction, resulting in the arrest of Xu Haiqing and his wife. It is undeniable that he abused his power to oppress residents because his self-interest was not fulfilled. (2) Regarding Xun Jipei and Xu Shaoqing: Xun Jipei and Xu Shaoqing submitted a request to the Social Bureau in October of the 20th year of the Republic, stating that they intended to jointly open a boiled water shop at No. 116 of the Third Civilian Housing Unit and had obtained a registration certificate, but the person subject to disciplinary action did not allow them to open for business. The Social Bureau dispatched personnel to investigate and found that No. 116 of the Third Civilian Housing Unit was rented to Han Naimao. Xun Jipei applied for the registration certificate on July 30 of the 20th year of the Republic, when the house was not yet completed and the house number had not yet been assigned. Xu Shaoqing only rented No. 32 of the housing unit on September 18 of the 20th year of the Republic, which does not match the house number in Xun Jipei's registration certificate. Therefore, Xun Jipei was ordered to surrender the registration certificate, which was not due to the request of the person subject to disciplinary action. The person subject to disciplinary action was not aware of Xun Jipei's application for registration. Although a request was submitted in September of the 20th year of the Republic that the boiled water shop in the Third Civilian Housing Unit be operated by a consumer cooperative, it was unrelated to the reason for Xun Jipei's surrender of the registration certificate. The allegation by Xun Jipei and others that they were extorted for 200 yuan is based on the fact that the person subject to disciplinary action had written a draft agreement and ordered them to copy and sign it, with Article 2 stating that if merchants can subsidize the cooperative by 200 yuan, all boiled water shops and tea shops will be operated by the merchants. The person subject to disciplinary action argued that he did not provide the draft agreement. There is no other way to prove that it was indeed provided by the person subject to disciplinary action. Furthermore, this matter was investigated by the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor at Xun Jipei's request, who deemed that there was no fraud and ruled for non-prosecution. This part should also be dismissed. (3) Regarding Han Dexiang: Han Dexiang distributed an urgent notice in the Third Civilian Housing Unit on May 3 of this year, convening a meeting to demand rent reduction. The person subject to disciplinary action sent it to the Public Security Bureau for review. The Public Security Bureau forwarded it to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor, who deemed that it did not meet the requirements of the crime of disturbing public order under the Criminal Law and did not prosecute. It is not objectionable that the person subject to disciplinary action sent Han Dexiang to the Public Security Bureau for review in order to prevent incidents from occurring. However, in the report submitted to the Social Bureau, it was stated that Han Dexiang was instigated by the communists to incite unrest and disrupt order, without any basis. Such wording, considering the duty of public officials to act cautiously, cannot be said to be anything but rash. In conclusion, except for the dismissed parts, the person subject to disciplinary action has committed acts described in Article 2, Paragraph 1, and Paragraph 2 of the Civil Service Disciplinary Law. In accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 3 and Article 6 of the same law, it is resolved as stated in the main text. September 6, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Shanghai Municipal Civil Service Disciplinary Committee, Chairman Zhu Fengwei, Committee Member Zhao Shulan, Committee Member Yao Fuxiang, Committee Member Qian Chengjun, Committee Member Pang Shurong, Committee Member Luo Renji.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Corpses' Families of the Xin Renhe Tragedy Petition for Provisional Attachment of the Guarantee Money <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Renhe steamboat of the Yuxing Shipping Company in the Nanshi district had a tragic incident in which Ma Koubao, Mei Laoer, and three others were murdered. Afterward, the Shanghai Local Court arrested and sentenced the shipowner, Sun Xingsheng, the compradore, Chen Baosheng, and the stewards and sailors. Sun and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Suzhou High Court, awaiting interrogation in Suzhou. It has now been learned that the families of the deceased, such as Ma Chenshi, Mei Youshi, Ma Zhoushi, Wei Zhushi, etc., recently hired lawyer Yu Xiangqin to draft a petition to the Local Court Mediation Office, requesting that all of the guarantee money and the pledge money deposited by the 74 defendants, including Sun Xingsheng, be provisionally attached to the Yuxing Company, in order to prevent concealment and facilitate execution. The petition stated, in brief, that according to the general practice of various shipping companies and the confession of the defendant Ye Yuanfu on April 28 of this year, there is no doubt that the incidental civil lawsuit part of the petitioners has been judged by the court that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for compensation, but the defendants cunningly claim that they have no property at home, and they intend to avoid compensation. If this guarantee money and the pledge money are not attached today, it is feared that they will collude to conceal it in the future, making execution difficult. Therefore, the petition requests provisional attachment to prevent concealment and facilitate execution. Furthermore, the petitioners have suffered this extraordinary disaster, and their situation is extremely tragic. They are wandering in a foreign land, facing the danger of freezing and starvation, etc. Judge Han Zuoti held a court session (none of the defendants attended), and only the petitioners' lawyer Yu Xiangqin attended the court and recounted the previous events. The judge said, "Upon investigation, there is no solid proof of the objects of the provisional attachment in this case, and it cannot proceed." Lawyer Yu replied, "The defendant Ye Yuanfu confessed that each steward and sailor had a guarantee money of 500 yuan deposited in the shipping company. Please, Your Honor, exercise your authority to investigate the Yuxing Shipping Company's books, which should make it clear." The judge also said, "The entire case file of the Criminal Court has now been sent to the High Court and cannot be examined." As a result, it was decided to wait for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e137">No More Planting is Allowed on the New Prison Site of the Second Branch of the High Court <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court recently requisitioned several acres of land in the Pu Song District in western Shanghai to build a prison. When the land was requisitioned, there were still various types of plants growing on it. Now that it is autumn harvest time, the plants can be gradually harvested. The court is deeply concerned that the original owners might continue planting, seeing that the construction has not yet started. Therefore, the president of the court, Shen Jia Yi, issued a prohibition yesterday and had the notice written on a wooden sign, which was placed in the fields. The notice reads as follows: Public Notice: This court is building a new prison in the 30th Bao and 7th Tu of the Pu Song District in this city. The requisitioned land has been fenced off, and a notice has been issued prohibiting infringement. It is understood that the plants planted on this land before the requisition should be allowed for the original owners to harvest at the appropriate time. However, once harvested, no further planting is allowed. If anyone plants on the above-mentioned land or engages in other infringing acts in the future, the Tu Dibao shall be responsible for prohibiting them at any time and for removing the planted plants. If they refuse to comply, they shall be handed over to the police precinct for punishment. All must comply with this notice.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Residents of Yufu Lane in the French Concession Object to the Demolition of Houses <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>An Emergency Meeting Was Held Yesterday. The landlord of the houses in Yufu Lane, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, notified the tenants in August of this year that the houses would be demolished and rebuilt on September 11, and all tenants were required to move out. The tenants, however, argued that the houses inside the lane were built in 1919, only 14 years ago. The houses are brand new and quite sturdy, and the houses on the outside of the lane were only built 18 years ago, which is not yet the time for rebuilding. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their opposition. They also organized a delegation to request the landlord to maintain the houses for at least another five years. However, the landlord stated that all engineering plans had been completed and that it was difficult to accept the tenants' demands. Starting yesterday, they suddenly cut off the street lights in the lane, plunging the entire lane into darkness. At the same time, they sent people to notify each household that if they did not move out, the water and electricity supply to the tenants would be cut off. Upon hearing this, the tenants were all alarmed and held an emergency meeting at the Fourth District Branch of the Municipal Federation at 4 p.m. yesterday. All the tenants were present, and Yang Yingzhai chaired the meeting. The following resolutions were passed: (1) All tenants will unite to the end and will not move out in the face of any oppression. (2) Yang Yingzhai, Yang Youbin, Jiang Shunjian, and others are designated as representatives to immediately send letters of petition to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession and the Shanghai Second Special District Municipal Union, seeking help. (3) Another date will be set for all tenants to hold a large-scale petition to the Party and government authorities. (4) If the landlord implements the suspension of water and electricity supply, which will affect public safety and tranquility, they will resolutely file a lawsuit in accordance with the law and declare that the landlord shall be responsible for the resulting losses. (5) Lawyers will be hired to ensure legal protection. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3 id="e139">A Sandboat Was Lost in a Hurricane <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>=All Thirty-Plus People Aboard Survived Except for Four=</p>
<p>=Haizhou Saved Them; What Happened to the Rest is Unknown=</p>
<p>The Hongchangxing sandboat, owned by Tongzhou Liji, was hired by Xiangchengyong Yuji and other firms from Yingkou to sail to Chongsha to transport cotton cloth and other goods worth over 60,000 yuan. After loading the cargo, the boat set sail, but on the first of this month, when it reached the northern sea off Qidong, a strong wind suddenly arose. The waves were rough, but the boat was still able to navigate. However, when it reached the sea off Dajishan, the wind became even stronger. The sailors knew it was a hurricane and tried to seek shelter, but the hurricane became more intense, and the waves crashed over the boat. The boat owner, Mr. Peng, tried to find a port to dock, but the strong wind made it impossible. The sailors were panicking when a gust of hurricane blew, and a large wave crashed down, snapping the mainmast. At this point, the sailors knew that the broken mast meant they had lost the ability to navigate. They were terrified. The thirty-plus people on board called for help to no avail and could only drift with the wind and waves. On the morning of the third, the wind and waves finally pushed them to the northeast coast of Dajishan, where they were stranded on the rocks and overturned. The boat was flooded by the waves. At that time, the sailors saw that the boat was completely flooded and beyond saving. They threw the planks into the sea, clung to them, and waited to be rescued. Five of the sailors drifted on the sea for two days and nights. On the fifth, a Haizhou steamboat passed by, saw them, stopped, lowered the gangplank, and rescued the five sailors. They were given clothes to change and two yuan each, and sent to Haimen to go ashore. One of the sailors died of illness in Haimen. Yesterday, the four rescued sailors came to Shanghai by boat and reported the names of the firms. They said that when the hurricane struck and the waves crashed over the boat, three or four people were washed away. In the panic, they could not remember clearly. After the boat overturned, they desperately tried to save themselves and escaped. The five of them clung to a plank and drifted on the sea waiting to be rescued. Fortunately, the Haizhou steamboat rescued them. The boat owner, Mr. Peng, and the other twenty-seven sailors were not seen on the sea. It is feared that they did not survive. Although the boat is stranded on the rocks, the strong hurricane and waves will surely damage it and wash it away. It will be difficult to go there to find it.</p>
<h3 id="e140">A Bullet at the South Railway Station <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>A Careless Police Officer Luckily Didn't Injure Anyone. At the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, at around 9 a.m. yesterday, the station was preparing to open the third and fourth-class passenger cars bound for Hangzhou. There were many passengers at the fourth-class ticket booth, and they were purchasing tickets and boarding the cars. Suddenly, there was a gunshot. The passengers were all startled. Upon investigation, it was found that a police officer on duty at the second post of the fourth-class ticket booth (on duty from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.) was unloading the bullets from his Mauser pistol. Due to a mistake, he had not unloaded all the bullets, and one bullet remained. When the mechanism was pushed, the bullet was ejected from the barrel. Luckily, it did not injure anyone, but all the passengers were startled. The chief of the railway police, Chief Han, personally went to investigate the matter in order to report it for handling.</p>

<p>Lin Tingyou, a Guangdong native, has been running a rattan shop at No. 186 North Jiangxi Road for many years. Recently, due to the success of his business, he bought a green car a month ago to use as transportation and to solicit sales. His ostentatious behavior was coveted by nearby bandits (Liang Yulin, Feng Guoxing, and Li Dayun, fellow villagers at No. 170 across the street). Liang wrote a threatening letter, demanding 300 yuan and drawing two axes, threatening violence if the money was not paid. The letter was delivered on the seventh of this month. It instructed to put a "Fu" character on the door if the demands were met and to throw a paper-wrapped package of money into a trash can behind the back door of No. 170 the next afternoon. The letter stated that someone would come to collect the money. After receiving the letter, Lin immediately reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. The police station sent Chinese detectives Wang Debiao and Li Zexing in disguise as rickshaw pullers to secretly watch. The victim first put a package of paper that looked like 300 yuan into the trash can and returned. The detectives watched the activity nearby. After a while, Liang and Feng came out of No. 170, lingered around for a long time, looked around, and returned to the house. At 11:30 a.m., Liang Yulin came out again, picked up the paper package, and tried to escape. The detectives rushed forward and arrested him on the spot. Feng and Li were subsequently apprehended in an upstairs room at No. 170 and taken to the police station for detention. The lawyer of the Criminal Court Three of the Special District Court, Zhang Tianyin, detailed the previous events to the court and presented the threatening letter for inspection. He requested a postponement of the investigation to determine if the defendants were involved in other cases. Then, the victim Lin Tingyou testified about the incident. Liang Yulin confessed that he wrote the threatening letter. The case was initiated because he knew that the victim's financial situation was good after he bought a new car. However, the testimonies of the defendants Feng and Li were evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefei instructed that they be remanded into custody for further investigation and interrogation.</p>

<p>Yang Guiying, a 19-year-old woman from Hubei, residing at No. 17 South Chengdu Road, had an argument with her mother the other day for some reason. Afterward, the woman, lost in thought and resentment, became tired of life and secretly swallowed opium paste to commit suicide. Her mother discovered her moaning in bed and sent her to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. She soon died. The hospital reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detective Chen Shanji to investigate. The body was taken to the Forensic Inspection Office on Filun Road. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to visit the office to inspect the body. During the inquest, the mother of the deceased, Yang Yu Shi, 51 years old, testified that her daughter had studied for several years, but she was planning to stop her education. That day, her daughter suddenly asked to continue her studies, but she refused because her daughter was already grown up and had been betrothed to someone in their hometown. This led to an argument, but she did not expect her to take poison. Prosecutor Guo obtained the testimony and, following the instructions, confirmed that the deceased Yang Guiying, female, died from opium poisoning taken before death.</p>
<p>The body was handed over to her mother, Yang Yu Shi, to sign a statement and take it back for burial.</p>

<p>Wo Caizheng, a native of Ningbo Zhenhai, 44 years old, rents a house near the West Gate. His concubine, Wo Meishi (31 years old), has not had any children since their marriage. Wo was past the age of forty and still lacked an heir. Therefore, in January of the 20th year of the Republic, he was introduced to Wang Meixian, a 19-year-old woman from the same hometown, to be his concubine. Meixian is 21 years old this year. Soon after entering the household, she created discord and provoked quarrels for no reason. Wo and his wife are naturally weak and have endured her in every possible way, hoping that the concubine would have a child, and that things would improve. However, Wang Meixian became more demanding and made unreasonable troubles all day long. Wo and his wife suffered unbearably. On the 24th of last month, Wang Meixian made a fuss and destroyed things again for no reason. Wo could no longer bear it and filed a criminal lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office. Unexpectedly, Wang Meixian left the house without saying goodbye the next day. Wo searched everywhere but could not find her. Shortly after, he received a letter from Wang Meixian's uncle, Wang Honglai (residing on Kunming Road, Hongkou), and learned that Meixian was staying with him. Wo then hired lawyer Hu Fenglian to file a petition with the Local Court Mediation Office to terminate his relationship with Wang Meixian. Judge Han held a court hearing yesterday, but neither party attended. Only lawyer Hu attended the court on behalf of the petitioner Wo Cai, and described the situation. The judge said that since the opposing party, Wang Meixian, did not attend, a formal lawsuit must be filed five days later.</p>

<p>Sijiao Mountain, located outside of the Wusong Sanjia Water Inlet and under the jurisdiction of Chongming County, is an isolated island. The residents of the entire island make a living by fishing. During the recent hurricane, the island was directly hit, causing even greater damage. Thousands of houses were destroyed throughout the island, and more than three hundred fishing boats were destroyed and washed away. Seawater flooded the island to a height of about ten feet. Fortunately, most of the fishermen escaped to the top of the mountain and were not drowned, but they have no homes to return to and are waiting to die. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. The disaster victims have now telegraphed the provincial government and various charitable organizations, appealing for urgent relief to prevent them from starving to death.</p>

<p>According to the organizers of the joint association of charitable organizations raising funds for the emergency relief of the Yellow River flood, the disaster was most severe in western Shandong, especially in Heze County. The tragic situation in that county has been reported in various newspapers and need not be repeated. Now, the Party and government officials, gentry, and merchants of that county have jointly organized a relief association to request disaster relief from the government authorities and various charitable organizations in Shanghai.

<p>The Jisheng Society Hopes for Donations from Philanthropists</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a report from the Zhenwu branch of Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, stating that on the evenings of July 21st and 22nd of this year, there were severe storms with thunder and lightning, and heavy rain poured down. The water depth on the plains was one or two feet. As a result, the Zhiqing Rivers rose violently, and mountain floods occurred suddenly, with the water head being one or two zhang high. When it flowed to Jiaolongbao, the two rivers converged, and the water became even more powerful, inundating countless autumn fields and causing many deaths and injuries. The area surrounding the Luchaoyunyang town Zhangjiatun Yuyu River, covering forty or fifty li, was completely turned into a swamp. The disaster was so severe that it was unbearable to witness. The number of drowned people was countless. There were no districts without disasters. According to the statistics, there were 2,309 households whose names could be verified, 36,198 mu of autumn fields were inundated, 542 houses were collapsed, 146 kilns were flooded, 83 people whose names were confirmed were drowned, one or two dozen livestock were drowned, and seventeen waterwheels were washed away. As for the agricultural implements, tables, stools, and other items of each household, they were also washed away by the water. This year's summer harvest was meager, and the people had no savings. Even the food they had was washed away by the water. They are displaced, starving during the day, and sleeping in the open at night. Moreover, there has been a drought for six years, and no less than thirty or forty thousand people have died of starvation or fled. The survivors have suffered from floods again. The plight of the Jingyang people is truly unprecedented in hundreds of years. Furthermore, from August 7th to 9th, 10th, and 11th, the Jing River rose violently four or five times, inundating more than one hundred hectares of autumn fields along the river. Many guest residents living by the river have already drowned. On the 18th, there was another heavy rain, inundating Yanwang Village, Niaoertan, and other places. All of the autumn fields were submerged. Houses and kilns in the Yuzigou Erlanggou Mushuwan were mostly washed away. The Jinghui Canal bank, which runs from Yanwang Village to Mushuwan, forty or fifty li long and twenty or more li wide, near the northern plateau, was often washed away, submerging even more autumn crops. The autumn fields near the county seat were also inundated by the canal water. This is the third time they have suffered from floods. On the evening of the 23rd, there was a strong wind with thunder and rain. The county stopped soon after, but in Yuyu River under Yunyang and other places, heavy rain poured down, and the water rose on the plains again, inundating the autumn crops and also falling large hailstones, killing birds in the air. This is the fourth time they have suffered from hailstorms. The investigation of the first and second floods in the Qingyu River has been completed. The autumn fields in the plains and plateaus that have not suffered from floods have been severely affected by drought. Most of the grain ears are dry, and the cotton stalks are red and do not produce any fruit. There is no hope for the autumn harvest. The remaining people are in extreme suffering. This is a sad telegram, requesting a large sum of money to save the disaster victims. The society has provided relief to Shaanxi for many years, but the amount is not sufficient. Now, because the income from relief donations is very small, it is hoped that compassionate comrades at home and abroad will have the perseverance and great aspirations to help each other and save lives. The merits and virtues are inconceivable.</p>

<p>The Case Solved on the Spot; Shi Zhigen Confesses Without Reservation</p>
<p>Zhang Yuchi, the director of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, is a local, seventy years old this year, and runs a soy sauce garden. He is usually quite enthusiastic about local public welfare undertakings. Last year, he fell from a car and injured his foot, and recently relies on people to carry him in and out. The day before yesterday morning, he suddenly received an anonymous letter, which stated, "By order of the Soviet government, a liaison office has been established in Wusong. We are currently in urgent need of funds and are temporarily borrowing 2,000 yuan from your esteemed office," and attached six procedures: (1) The loan amount is fixed at 2,000 yuan and must not be less. (2) Wrap the banknotes in newspaper. (3) Place it in the trash can next to the public toilet north of Wusong Town Railway Station at 8:00 PM on September 9th. (4) Do not discuss this loan with outsiders before the loan procedures are cleared. (5) Do not report to the police, and do not send anyone to secretly investigate that night, or you will be dealt with by a handgun. (6) If you do not comply with the above conditions, your house will be reduced to ashes," etc. After receiving the letter, Zhang reported it to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, District Chief Gong Xikui, after discussing a plan with District Officer Yin Gongtian, led detectives and secretly went to ambush in a hidden place at around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 9th). They first placed a package wrapped in paper in the designated trash can, and attached two bells below the package. Around 9:00 PM, several people came and lingered near the trash can. Then, one person first used a flashlight to shine into the trash can, and seeing the paper package inside, reached out to pick it up, triggering the attached bells. The ambushing detectives immediately rushed forward and captured four people on the spot. They were all taken to the district. After interrogation by District Chief Gong, one was Shi Zhigen, one was Zhu Ziwen, one was Chen Xiaomao, and one was Tao Hegen. Shi Zhigen confessed that due to financial difficulties, he wrote the letter for extortion without reservation. The remaining Zhu Ziwen was found to have no suspicion of collusion and was released on bail pending trial. Chen Xiaomao and Tao Hegen were released without charge. Shi Zhigen was detained and taken to the bureau yesterday afternoon for interrogation.</p>

<p>Lodging in Someone's Home Causes No Small Amount of Trouble</p>
<p>A woman named Wang Guo, from Haizhou, is currently forty years old and worked as a maid in the home of someone surnamed in the Ximen Road area of the French Concession. Recently, due to frequent thefts in the employer's home, she was blamed for negligence and was dismissed. Ms. Wang went to the home of a fellow maid, Ms. Yang Han, who was from Anhui, requesting lodging and planning to find another employer. Ms. Yang Han, because she was still working as a maid at her employer's home, could not accommodate outsiders, and led Ms. Wang to the home of her younger sister, Ms. Yang Zhu, at No. 34 Taihe Lane, Boer Road, for temporary lodging. Unexpectedly, Ms. Wang suddenly attempted suicide. On the afternoon of the 9th, while Ms. Yang Zhu was out, she used a cloth strip to hang herself. When Ms. Yang Zhu, the younger sister of Ms. Yang Han, returned home at 6:00 PM, she discovered that Ms. Wang had already died. The second landlord, Liu Abao, reported it to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was then taken by vehicle to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. There were no family members in Shanghai. Yesterday, a report was made to the Second Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren to come to the site. After examining the body, it was determined that the deceased, Wang Guo, had indeed died by hanging herself. Witnesses Yang Han, Yang Zhu, and the second landlord Liu Abao were questioned about the circumstances of the discovery. It was then ordered that the body be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographs and burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>

Recently, manager Chen Zusi discovered that Yan had been secretly collecting account payments from various local and out-of-town shops from August 1st to the end of the month, totaling 311 yuan from several households in Shanghai, including Daoxiangcun, Tongfuzhai, Caizhizhai, and Yuexiangzhai. The amount of money he had collected from out-of-town shops also totalled to hundreds of yuan. When Yan was asked about this, he was evasive, so the police were notified. Detective Wang Maonan arrested Yan and brought him to the Second Special District Court, charging him with embezzlement. The prosecution stated that the accounts collected by the defendant from out-of-town shops had not yet been verified, and requested that the verified local accounts be used as evidence. The defendant claimed that he was buying goods on behalf of the plaintiff and that he normally took a 5% discount, resulting in nearly 20,000 yuan in business transactions. According to his calculations, the plaintiff should have returned money to him and that he had no use for the false accusations. The court ordered a postponement until the 19th and instructed the plaintiff to present the account books and evidence for further examination. The defendant was released on a 500-yuan security bond, and without a guarantor, he was detained.</p>

<p>The Xidu Pier in Yangjing, Pudong, is one of the public ferry piers in Pudong. It was previously submitted by the Pond Engineering Relief Bureau to the Shanghai County Magistrate, who reported it in detail to the Shanghai Daoyin and the Jiangsu Diplomatic Commissioner, who approved it, stating that if there were requests to raise and fill mud, a road should be left out, etc. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Bureau, in order to develop the municipal ferry, has changed the location of the Xidu Pier and blocked the old Xidu Pier's exit road to Pudong, causing opposition from local residents. If the Municipal Ferry route is to go from the Tongren Pier in Shanghai to Gaoqiao in the east, according to the plan of the Public Utility Bureau, the people of Yangjing who travel between Pudong and Puxi must take the Municipal Ferry and detour to the Tongren Pier in Shanghai. However, the old Xidu Pier and the newly located pier both have two exit roads to Pudong that can be used for crossing. Now that the location has been changed and one road has been blocked, the residents are suffering from inconvenience.</p>

<p>Hughills Loses, America Despairs | The Champion Will Be Either Perry or Crawford |</p>
<p>(Forest Hills, 9th, Reuters) The All-American Tennis Singles Championship will be won by a British man. The contestants competing for the title in the final are Crawford, the Wimbledon and Australian champion, and Perry, the leader of the British Davis Cup team.</p>
<p>Perry Takes a Sharp Turn | Under the gaze of 8,000 spectators today, Perry defeated Stoffen in the quarter-finals in three straight sets, 6-3 in the first set and 6-2 in the second and third sets. Stoffen has never suffered such a crushing defeat since participating in first-class tennis. Perry's forehand and backhand shots were sharp, and his opponent struggled to cope, resulting in this outcome.</p>
<p>Crawford Ends American Hope | Crawford defeated Hughills in three straight sets, 7-5, 6-4, 6-3. Hughills, who was the only remaining American player, was disappointed and defeated. Crawford remained calm, and his backhand returns were accurate and mechanical, resulting in many points. Hughills was quick and agile, but had too many out-of-bounds balls.</p>

<p>100-meter Backstroke in 1 Minute 29.4 Seconds | 200-meter Breaststroke in 3 Minutes 19.6 Seconds | City Games Swimming Competition Concludes</p>
<p>Swimmer Yang Yuanhua created two new national records yesterday in the 100-meter backstroke and 200-meter breaststroke, adding much color to this year's Shanghai City Games swimming competition. His time in the 100-meter backstroke was 1 minute 29.4 seconds, and in the 200-meter breaststroke, it was 3 minutes 19.6 seconds, an improvement over the new record he set in the preliminary round on the first day, which is especially commendable. The audience at the Jiaotong University swimming pool was even more enthusiastic. All the swimming events in the City Games concluded yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e176">50-Meter Freestyle <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The first final event was the men's 50-meter freestyle. Wen Jingling's victory was as expected by the reporter, without a doubt, but the competition was fierce, with splashing waves, making it very exciting. Yu Rongbang was defeated by Yu Heng, and the famous Yin Yanjun fell to fourth place. Wen's time was 30.2 seconds. The women's 50-meter final was also very even, with only four people competing. Gong Xiji, the "fat lady," entered the water later and finally won the championship, but the performance was not very exciting.</p>

<p>Backstroke Breaks National Record</p>
<p>Yang Yuanhua 1 Minute 29.4 Seconds | In the second final, the 100-meter backstroke, Yang Yuanhua, who set a new national record of 1 minute 32.4 seconds in the preliminary round the day before, further shortened his time to 1 minute 29.4 seconds, breaking the national record again (the old record was 1 minute 38 seconds by Zeng Rongzhong), which is very gratifying. Yang exchanged splashes with one hand, as if in rhythm, with a consistent speed, advancing calmly, demonstrating a deep level of skill. Only two people competed in the women's backstroke, one was the "big guy" Gong Xiji, and the other was the "little girl" Bao Lengxue, one big and one small, contrasting interestingly. When the "big guy" Gong entered the water, because of her heavy body and improper technique, the water splashed and splashed on the spectators by the pool, causing them a lot of trouble. As a result, the bigger one won, and the smaller one lost.</p>
<p>1500 Meters</p>
<p>In the 1500-meter freestyle final, it was necessary to go back and forth 30 times (i.e., 60 one-way trips). The 400-meter champion, Zhou Dayun, was rich in stamina, his body rippling with the water, leaping forward. At one meter of the course, he had already exceeded the second person by two pools, while Zheng Guanxian retired from the water due to exhaustion after sixteen round trips. Zhou remained consistent throughout, brave and persistent. In the end, Zhou beat the second, Chen Yuquan, by 100 meters, with a time of 26 minutes 55.4 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Breaststroke Also Breaks National Record <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yang Yuanhua 3 Minutes 19.6 Seconds | Next was the 200-meter breaststroke, with the women's race first. The "little girl" Hu Qiyuan floated on the water, her posture was beautiful, back and forth a total of eight times, from beginning to end, without the slightest slack, she won the championship with 4 minutes 27 seconds, earning the audience's warm applause. The second, Gong Xiji, was one pool behind, the third, Zhang Jiazhen, the fourth, Tan Ruoju, two pools away from the third, still continued to implement the original intention, completed the whole process, the spirit is commendable.</p>
<p>In the men's group, Li Rixin, who set a new national record of 3 minutes 27.2 seconds in the preliminary round the day before, was defeated by Yang Yuanhua in the final, and Yang also broke the national record, and the time was 3 minutes 19.6 seconds, further breaking Li's new record. Li was runner-up, and the time seemed to be an improvement over his preliminary round (the old record was 3 minutes 27.8 seconds by Ma Zhihui). The competition between Yang and Li was fierce, and the whole pool suddenly became tense, and Li finally lagged behind by three or four yards.</p>
<p>100-Meter Freestyle</p>
<p>Men Have Fierce Battle, Women Very Funny</p>
<p>The men's 100-meter freestyle final was one of the most exciting scenes. Yin Yanjun, mindful of the lag in the 50 meters, strove to go upstream, fiercely competing with Zhou Rui, the others also did not relax, stirring up waves, the momentum was magnificent. Zhou won the championship, Yin was the runner-up, the difference was three yards away, the time was 1 minute 13.1 seconds. The start of the women's group was quite funny. The first time Hu Qiying was eager to try, and fell into the water before the order was given. At the same time, Hu Qiyuan involuntarily followed into the water. Rising out of the water to swim again, the two were as timid as mice. After the order was given, Qi Ying was still stunned and did not enter the water. Seeing others going forward, she jumped into the water. Yuan, seeing Qi Ying not entering the water, stood in the water again. Seeing Qi Ying entering the water, she started to swim again, and had already been overtaken by Gong Xiji by three or four meters. This was due to lack of experience. As a result, Gong was the first, and Ms. Yuan changed to swimming breaststroke in the middle, and finished third.</p>
<p>Men's Total Score</p>
<p>Yang Yuanhua 10 points, Zhou Dayun 10 points, Zhou Ruiqin 8 points</p>
<p>Chen Yuquan 6 points, Wen Jingling 5 points, Yin Yanjun 4 points, Yu Rongbang 4 points, Zhang Yunqi 3 points, Zhang Renheng 3 points, Xu Xiang 3 points, Li Rixin 3 points, Li Daoyi 2 points, Wen Ruiqiu 2 points, Zheng Wendao 1 point, Zhu Jiong 1 point, Huang Yuanli 1 point.</p>
<p>Women's Total Score</p>
<p>Gong Xiji 13, Zheng Baoxuan 8 points, Hu Qiyuan 8 points, Hu Qiying 5 points, Bao Lengxue 3 points, Zhang Jiazhen 2 points, Tan Ruoju 1 point.</p>

<p>In the Beijing Amateur Sports Association vs. Shanghai Chinese Sports Association tennis match, the Beijing team came to Shanghai a few days ago. There were a total of five singles matches, with four losses and one win. There were also two doubles matches, both of which were won. In one of the doubles matches, the Chinese team forfeited. The overall result was that the Chinese team won four to three.</p>

<p>Lost 1-3 to Liang Deguang and Carlsen | Our Rotary Cup Doubles Representatives Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang lost 1-3 to the Sino-American partnership of Liang Deguang and Carlsen at the Chinese Tennis Courts at 4:00 PM yesterday. This was a scene from the semi-quarterfinals of the Public Doubles of the Grass Tennis Association. The two sides had once clashed, but it did not end due to the lateness of the day. With the consent of both parties, it was decided to replay it yesterday to fight for the right to the quarterfinals. Since Liang Deguang and Carlsen won, they will meet Stoke and Koehl in the quarterfinals. First Set  When the battle began, Zheng and Yu were arm-in-arm, with a wonderful cooperation, so their progress was very rapid. If they could maintain their sharpness throughout, they could have finished the first set in the局 after 5-2, but due to slackness, they won 6-4.</p>
<p>Second Set  At the beginning, Zheng and Yu were still very strong, but after 3-3, they suddenly encountered the opponent's correct chop and fierce pressure, turning into a bad situation, and finally lost the second set 4-6.</p>
<p>Third Set  It is inevitable to disappoint that Zheng and Yu could have won but failed. At that time, they were leading 5-4, but suddenly suffered a blow with a decadent spirit, losing three consecutive games, and instead lost 7-5. The spectators on the wall all regretted it.</p>
<p>Fourth Set  At this time, Liang Deguang and Carlsen were stern and kept the net, with no opportunity to attack. Liang Deguang's baseline was just right, and Carlsen's serve was fast and powerful. Although Zheng and Yu tried their best to resist everything, they still fell at a disadvantage. Liang and Carlsen then completed the set with 6-2. Liang Deguang 4|6 Zheng Zhaojia</p>

<p>Estimate the Number of Athletes in Each Region | The latest news from the National Games Preparatory Committee is summarized below: (1) Continuing to report participants are Guizhou, Qingdao, Zhejiang, Nanjing, Hong Kong, etc. Hong Kong is participating in all events, Nanjing 250 people, Zhejiang men's swimming, track and field, volleyball, women's all-around, and national art. (2) Units with no news of participation include Shaanxi, Guangxi, Chahar, Xikang, Mongolia, Tibet, and Weihaiwei (there will always be successive reports soon). (3) Because the conference period is approaching, the units of Mongolia and Tibet have not yet registered to participate. Therefore, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was specially sent various rules and registration forms for review and handling. (4) Train and ship passes will be sent directly to each unit. Those on long distances will be entrusted to the China Travel Service to handle. (5) The round-trip travel expenses for each athlete in Xinjiang Province will be 1,400 yuan. Now that the political changes have just been settled, I am afraid that the pre-competition will not be able to learn about it in time. It is heard that the Beijing Office will summon the athletes who have participated in Beijing in the past 20 years (now all studying in various schools) to discuss participation methods.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Accommodation Arrangements <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>(1) All accommodation matters for the Games will be handled by the Accommodation Department of the Accommodation Group. (2) Regarding welcoming and sending off referees and athletes, the Accommodation Group has agreed on the following cooperative arrangements with the China Travel Service: 1. Before departing, all sports units or referees should obtain baggage stickers or tags from the local China Travel Service, clearly marking the name of the group, the individual's name, and the destination for identification. 2. Matters such as exchanging tickets for free or discounted tickets for train and ship berths, as well as checking baggage, should be coordinated with the local China Travel Service. When departing, the number of people, the train schedule, the ship name, and the arrival date should be telegraphed to the Accommodation Group through the China Travel Service. 3. All matters concerning liaison between the various units and the Accommodation Group should be handled by the team leader for the sake of standardization. 4. Large baggage of referees and athletes may be handed over to the Accommodation Group staff for safekeeping, but small personal items (such as handbags, small wicker baskets, etc.) should be carried by the individuals themselves. 5. Upon arrival of each group, the team leader shall hand over the large baggage to the Accommodation Group staff for transportation to the dormitory, and then hand it over to the team leader for receipt. The same procedure shall be followed upon departure, with the Accommodation Group responsible for transporting the baggage to the station or pier and handing it over to the respective team leaders. However, the team leader shall be responsible for observing the checking, collection, and delivery of baggage consigned to the railway to avoid errors. 6. After the team leader hands over the baggage to the Accommodation Group, no one may arbitrarily remove items before the baggage has been transported to its destination and properly delivered. 7. After the team leader hands over the baggage to the Accommodation Group staff, the Accommodation Group will issue a receipt, affix a label to each item of baggage, and transport it to its destination. The Accommodation Group's responsibility ends when the team leader receives the baggage without error and returns the receipt. If athletes are careless on the train and errors or losses occur, the Accommodation Department will do its best to assist in correction or investigation, but will not be liable for other responsibilities. 8. The Accommodation Group will have staff stationed at the Xiaguan Railway Station, Pukou Railway Station, Jiangbian Wharf, and the Games venue, together with China Travel Service staff, to handle the reception, collection, and care of baggage. 9. (Attached is a list of China Travel Service branches in various commercial ports throughout the country: Beiping, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Tianjin, Hong Kong, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhenjiang, Hankou, Jiujiang, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Tongguan, Yichang. Sports teams and referees who are departing from places without a China Travel Service can contact a branch of the China Travel Service in the above-mentioned locations along the way.) (3) Anyone wishing to host a banquet for referees and athletes must register with the Accommodation Department three days in advance so that a schedule can be arranged. Except in special circumstances, requests for rescheduling will not be granted. (4) In order to facilitate the check-in procedures and inquiries for referees and athletes, the Accommodation Group has set up information desks at the Games venue, Xiaguan Railway Station, Pukou Railway Station, Xiaguan Jiangbian, and the Lizhi Society. (5) Referees must first present their letter of appointment from the Games upon arrival, collect a registration form, fill it out in detail, exchange it for a Games handbook and badge, and a lodging permit, and then move into the dormitory in sequence according to the number on the permit. (6) Upon arrival, each team's athletes should first have their team leader report to the check-in desk, submit verification documents, collect a registration form from the information desk, fill it out in detail, exchange it for a Games handbook, badge, and lodging permit, and then move into the dormitory in sequence according to the number on the permit.

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>＝Pay Close Attention to the Health of Farmers＝</p>
<p>＝New Medicine and Pharmaceuticals Should Be Popularized to the Public＝</p>
<p>Rural hygiene work has two important meanings:</p>
<p>(1) We acknowledge that the most hardworking people in China today are the farmers, and also the poorest;</p>
<p>The lives lived by farmers in the Chinese interior are truly inhuman (perhaps they themselves are unaware): In terms of health, countless farmers with sallow faces and emaciated bodies continue to work like cattle and horses. A single outbreak of plague can kill many farmers, a single outbreak of smallpox can kill many small farmers. Even a minor illness forces them to seek out old-fashioned medicine, and countless souls are unjustly added to the City of the Dead. The deaths of women and infants during childbirth at the hands of old-style midwives are numerous. Alas, alas! As people who study new medicine and pharmaceuticals, can we sit idly by and watch our compatriots suffer and die unjustly? Arise! We must relieve their pain, we must prevent and treat their diseases, and we must find ways to improve their health so that farmers can live and work in peace. The restoration of agriculture is the most pressing issue of the day. To solve this problem relies entirely on the assistance of the government and the people, but a part of the responsibility rests on the shoulders of us in the field of new medicine. (2) When we recall that new medicine and pharmaceutical education has been practiced in China for a long time, the question is: who are the people who enjoy the benefits of new medicine and pharmaceuticals? The graduates of medical and pharmaceutical schools each year, those who return after studying abroad, are mostly in the cities. How can the poor villagers enjoy any of the benefits of new medicine? Because they do not enjoy the benefits of new medicine, they naturally do not believe in it. Everyone! Don't we want to make the entire country scientific in medicine and pharmaceuticals? Arise! Start in the villages. After ten years, scientific new medicine will likely be prevalent throughout the country, and unscientific old medicine will likely be completely eliminated?</p>
<p>Today, we raise this issue with two hopes: First, we hope that the entire field of new medicine and pharmaceuticals will, from today onwards, pay attention to this issue, contribute our implementation plans and opinions, and personally go to the villages and begin work.</p>
<p>Second, we hope that readers throughout the country will write to us about the health conditions in their hometowns and the areas they hope to improve. We will make them public to the masses at any time as a direction for research and improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Discussion of Jiao Yitang's Letter to the Nation on the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations (Continued) <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "The shortcoming of national medicine is that in theoretical aspects, it is mixed with some metaphysics, and in comparison with modern science, there are naturally many places that do not match... Young national doctors, although they are learning national medicine, are very able to express abandonment of the metaphysical theories in national medicine, or at least hold a skeptical attitude because national medicine is empiricism and does not value theory. Generally, Western doctors believe that metaphysics is the basic consciousness of national medicine." Mr. Jiao is neither too tight nor too loose. I will tell you one thing: Experimentation requires the consciousness of material civilization, excellent equipment, and a mastery of natural sciences, mathematics, chemistry, and physics, and the examination must be precise. Only then can the results and records be detailed, avoid errors, approach the truth, and have true value in academics. If, as Mr. Jiao admits, material civilization is not advanced, there is no excellent equipment to use, and the national doctors' examination is imprecise, when exploring in terms of academic theory, what ability do they have to experiment? What tools do they use to experiment? What knowledge do they have to judge the phenomena obtained by experimentation? The Huainanzi Qisu Training says: "The Hu people see fake goods and do not know that they can be made into cloth. The Yue people see feathers and do not know that they can be made into felt. Therefore, it is difficult to talk about change with those who are not familiar with things." In the daily experience of noble national doctors, perhaps very valuable phenomena are occasionally revealed, but they are simply inexplicable, looking at them and thinking that they have grasped the essence. What further method is there? Mr. Jiao puts the word "experiment" in the hands of national doctors, which seems to be somewhat divorced from the scope of "exploring in terms of academic theory" and starting to make exaggerated publicity. Mr. Jiao, alas! The tricks that your noble national doctors are doing now can only be called "traditional habits." When a patient comes, they routinely take his pulse, routinely prescribe a prescription, use Ephedra for fever without sweat, use Pinellia for expectorant, use Poria for diuresis, use Aconite for weak pulse. In summer, they routinely use some fresh lotus leaves. If the patient gets better after taking the medicine, of course, it is my credit. If not, there is a large text of "Beware of changes" written at the end of the pulse record, and you can also say, "As I expected." Now, the parents in society generally worship and chant for the spirits, burn paper ingots, and take Xingjun Powder when their children are sick. They swallow Liushen Pills for a sore throat and scrape Sha for an upset stomach. The work of national doctors is exactly the same as these practices, completely inexplicable and following a routine story. Therefore, I say it is a "traditional habit." As for whether the pulse can diagnose the disease, whether Ephedra, Pinellia, Poria, Aconite, dried ginger, fresh lotus leaves, as well as worshipping, burning paper ingots, taking Xingjun Powder, swallowing Liushen Pills, and scraping Sha can cure the disease, whether the disease is cured because Ephedra, Pinellia, Poria, Aconite, dried ginger, fresh lotus leaves, and chanting work or for what reason can paper ingots, Xingjun Powder, Liushen Pills, Sha, etc. have effects and for what reason will Qin have effects, etc. they only look at it and do not understand at all. Therefore, the "traditional habits" worked by national doctors only provide some experimental materials to scientific doctors. If this is to be considered an experiment, this exaggerated publicity is a bit embarrassing.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao hangs the sign of empiricism in front of the national medicine gate on the one hand, saying that they do not value theory, but on the other hand, he prepares for doctors to "explore from a theoretical perspective" and "study from a theoretical perspective." I don't know what the difference is between theory and learning in Mr. Jiao's mind?</p>
<p>"The possibility of science transformation, saying that it is science transformation, cannot be called national medicine. Regarding the latter point, academics can be consistent with science, but there can be different learning between countries." This is Mr. Jiao's mistake of comparing English, German, Japanese, and Chinese to English doctors, German doctors, Japanese doctors, and Chinese doctors. I have already clarified this in the first section of this discussion, so I will not say it again.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said: "In terms of experience,... although his diagnostic methods do not conform to science, they can conform to reality. Due to his diagnostic insights and treatment, although the theory is inaccurate, the efficacy is effective, just like three plus five plus eight. He can only tell you that the answer is ten, but he cannot create the formula. But curing diseases is not like researching other kinds of science. The requirement for the answer is more urgent than listing the formula." From these words, it seems that Mr. Jiao only understands elementary arithmetic. For simple problems like "three plus five plus eight," there is no need to list the formula. Mental arithmetic can be used to answer it. If you encounter advanced mathematics and physics, I am afraid that the formula is necessary! For superficial diagnoses, such as "Someone's wife has not had her period for more than a month, has a bit of a poor appetite, and often feels nauseous. She is pregnant." You don't need to ask your noble national doctors for this diagnosis. Even an illiterate village woman can tell you that. However, if there are problems with the uterus or ovaries, there are also the above-mentioned symptoms. In cases of doubt, it is necessary to determine whether she is pregnant or sick. At this time, or to prove whether or not she is pregnant, which affects legal and family matters, I am afraid that a complex formula is needed. Not only is the village woman useless, but also your noble national doctors' pulse principles, such as "One Yin beats Yang, meaning pregnancy," and "If a woman's hand Shaoyin pulse moves greatly, she is pregnant," are useless. When exploring this kind of answer in terms of academic theory, I am afraid that it is not as simple as "three plus five plus eight" and can be done with mental arithmetic. Therefore, mathematics that cannot produce a formula can only be considered a simple problem in elementary school and cannot be applied to advanced and complex science. This is what I said above: "Small paths are worth seeing, but going far is afraid of getting stuck, the gentleman does not do it."</p>
<p>Since Mr. Jiao knows that national doctors' diagnoses are not precise, and since he knows that even a formula cannot be created, then all the contradictory phenomena between theory and fact of your noble national doctors must also be attributed to the four words "luck and coincidence." In the past, old doctors with conscience and old doctors with research ideas also frankly said that it was luck. Zhang Huang, Wang Xunchen, Xu Lingtai, all of them. Only a group of city monks like your noble national doctors with the intention of deceiving people said that the effectiveness has been consistent. Mr. Jiao would also say "to grasp the essence," "to know why but not be able to tell others," and "his shortcoming is his strength," jumping out of the circle of academic exploration to talk nonsense. Mr. Jiao, alas! Experience is unreliable. Relying on experience without rigorously examining it with scientific experiments can easily lead to errors. In my "Critique of Huanghan Medicine," there is a passage on experience and experimentation that seems worth presenting to Mr. Jiao and the people of the country. I have excerpted it below for your humble reference!</p>
<p>"For example, on a tall building, if you throw a copper coin and a chicken feather at the same time, the copper coin will fall straight down, while the chicken feather will flutter and flutter and take a long time to reach the ground. The fact that the coin and feather fall at very different rates is something everyone feels. No one says it is wrong. It is absolutely true. I am afraid that there is no more reliable experience in the world than the fact that the coin and feather fall at different rates... But how could anyone know that when a scientist comes out and uses a long glass tube, puts the coin and feather in the tube, and evacuates the air inside, then inverting the tube, he can experiment and find that the coin and feather fall together, and it is not necessarily true that one is faster or slower. From this, a discovery is made: the phenomenon of an object falling is not only related to the object and the earth's gravity, but there is also a third party participating in the middle that is invisible and inaudible, which is the influence of air. This is something that the empiricist would never have dreamed of... Experience only knows the phenomenon that the coin is fast and the feather is slow. As for what third party is participating, what fourth party is mixed in, everything is unseen and unheard. Therefore, it is only enough to recognize a complex and mixed natural phenomenon. It cannot be analyzed to make further observations to understand the original appearance of the activities of each molecule to complete the detailed study of this phenomenon. In other words, it only knows the resultant force expressed in physics and cannot actually take a further step to analyze how its component forces are and where they come from. It only knows the ready-made compounds in chemistry and cannot actually take a further step to analyze how its molecules are and what method they are made of. Therefore, relying solely on experience will only use the ready-made things in nature and the things invented by human instincts. His ideas and theories can only be based on superficial and messy current phenomena to organize empty theories. He cannot follow the root and thoroughly make further research..."</p>
<p>People of the country! After reading this passage, you can know that experience alone is unreliable! National doctors say "experience" repeatedly, all taking the holistic phenomenon as a unit, taking the complex phenomena of luck and coincidence as simple and pure facts, as absolutely true effects, as clear and understandable strengths. When exploring in terms of academic theory, there is no value at all. Mr. Jiao really should not talk about that kind of thing.</p>
<h3 id="e193">The True Meaning of Pharmacy Business (4) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Pharmacies in Norway and Sweden</p>
<p>The pharmacy systems of the two countries are the same. All pharmacies are specialized vocational businesses, that is, in addition to formal pharmacies, so-called ordinary grocery stores are very few. Their formal pharmacies are called Apotek, similar to Germany, with complete content and brilliant appearance. Only pharmacists can sell medicines. In other words, pharmacies are all opened by pharmacists, so the number of pharmacies is strictly fixed. That is, when a store owner dies, causing the store to close or add a new quota, the public must be notified first, and then the government selects qualified pharmacists. The recording of other public officials is the same, and they must also examine profound knowledge and pharmaceutical skills before they are allowed to replace or open a store. The daily business hours of the pharmacy are 12 hours, that is, from 8 or 9 am to 7 or 8 pm, and for the convenience of customers, the city's pharmacies are divided into several groups so that they can be on duty on Sundays, holidays, and nights throughout the year. Most pharmacies also hire qualified female assistants to practice in them. These assistants are dressed in white, which seems to match their professional attitude and capable skills. Therefore, the cleanliness and tidiness of their pharmacies are not without reason. Also, their pharmacists do not work in laboratories such as analytical and microscopic examinations, which is the same as in Belgium, but different from pharmacies elsewhere in Europe. Because there are other specialized agencies in society to handle these tasks.</p>
<p>The pharmacy business in the above-mentioned countries can represent the pharmacy industry system in the entire Europe. Although the pharmacy business in some countries may not be exactly the same, the business purpose of their formal pharmacies is the same. It is nothing more than using specialized occupations to give full play to their skill contributions, which is a correct and grand purpose to serve human society. It is different from ordinary stores. As for the cultivation of morality, although it is ruled by national law, and when we trace the source, it is attributed to pharmaceutical education a lot (The End).</p>
<h3 id="e194">A Bird's-Eye View of Shanghai's Medical and Pharmaceutical Scene Over the Past Decade (Continued) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Kuo Ching-chou</p>
<p>Chapter VI: Medical and Pharmaceutical Education and Publications</p>
<p>Section 1: New Medical and Pharmaceutical Education</p>
<p>Nurses are crucial in modern medicine and pharmacy and should ideally have their own specialized departments with intensive training. However, in Shanghai, past nurses were trained independently by hospital-affiliated nursing programs. There was no standardized skill requirement, and while the work-study format of these programs benefited both students and hospitals, the inconsistent admission standards and inadequate instruction often led to uneven results. Moreover, hospitals varied in size and curriculum, and the languages studied included English, Japanese, German, and French. Additionally, midwifery school graduates, feeling they were taking a step down, reluctantly became nurses (though their training might not have suited them). Even clinics calling themselves hospitals liberally issued nursing diplomas. As a result, the nursing profession became a mixed bag, with varying levels of competence; some were audacious enough to become quack doctors, while others were too weak to find a place for themselves. Currently, Shanghai has two special nurses' associations, which temporarily meet the needs of patients and doctors, acting as employment agencies. I sincerely hope these two associations will develop in the future and, together with enthusiastic medical officials, work to organize the nursing profession in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Besides schools, there are also specialized research institutes, intended for graduated physicians and pharmacists to further their knowledge of fundamental medical and pharmaceutical sciences, not for ordinary students. However, the achievements in these institutes are, after all, the roots of academic theory, so I will briefly list them here.</p>
<p>Research institutions can be divided into two categories: the first being the research laboratories within schools. Besides providing students with practical experience, they naturally also provide professors and assistants in each department with opportunities for advanced research. Given the current economic conditions of various schools, these school research labs are not yet fully developed. Now, speaking only of independent research institutes, there are the following few, but unfortunately, not all are run solely by Chinese, and the range of subjects is not yet extensive enough.</p>
<p>(1) The Lister Institute: Founded with funds from the Englishman Lister, its new building on Avenue Road was completed last year, a magnificent sight. Currently, Chinese and foreign doctors are conducting research in physiology, pathology, and epidemiology, which have already begun. However, due to China's closed society, the availability of materials for pathological anatomy is insufficient, which is a great waste of this research institution.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences: This is one of the cultural projects designated under the Japanese return of the Boxer Indemnity. Naturally, Japanese scientists will jointly lead and conduct research here. The departments related to medicine are pathology, chemistry, and pharmacology. Some shortsighted people in society believe that engaging with the Japanese in this era is ultimately inappropriate. However, we must understand that academia knows no borders and should not be dictated by emotions. Given the perceived lack of purely national research institutes, these kinds of research facilities should be fully utilized and given careful attention.</p>
<p>(3) Forensic Institute of the Ministry of Justice: Located in Zhenru, it is a forensic research institution run by the ministry. It also accepts commissioned examination cases from various courts. I hope society recognizes the true principles of modern forensics so that bizarre articles promoting the "Washing Away of Wrongs" will not reappear as they did a few years ago with a certain lawyer.</p>
<p>(4) Department of Materia Medica Research, Peking Research Institute: The Peking Research Institute is organized similarly to the Academia Sinica. Due to the current situation, part of it has moved to Shanghai. Currently, the Department of Materia Medica is temporarily housed within the Sino-French University's School of Pharmacy. However, legitimate research on Chinese medicine is a slow process, unlike cunning merchants who casually call their products "scientific Chinese medicine," slapping a scientific label on anything and considering the matter settled. The public should pay attention to and urge on this type of research institution, rather than disliking their slowness and instead believing in quick fixes from false science.</p>
<p>(5) Hygiene Testing Laboratory: Both this and the Health Testing Laboratory of the British and French Concession Municipal Council are municipal health organizations. Given that they have research facilities and ample materials, if experts dedicate themselves to hard work there, they can certainly make significant contributions to academia.</p>
<p>In addition, some private research laboratories established by Chinese and foreigners are mostly half business (performing various testing work for practicing doctors) and half research. While it's not to say they have no advanced research to conduct, they face various economic and personnel difficulties, leading them to be short-lived. It's estimated that only seven or eight such laboratories currently exist in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Jottings from After Consultations (Continued) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fangzhi</p>
<p>Regarding the second aspect of their speaking ill of me, I also need not defend myself. One can understand from my Q&amp;A with the patient that I did not definitely advise her to go to Shanghai. Even if the trip to Shanghai went terribly wrong, it was she who walked into the trap herself. As for saying my medical skills are not good, I will describe the details of the uterine examination that day. Her cervical os was not a small, round, or oval shape. It was an irregularly curved, elongated shape, with obvious infiltrative thickening and swelling on the sides. The slightly everted mucosal surface was bleeding. When pressed with a finger, it felt relatively soft and fragile, which is a sign of an aggressive type of cancer. Given these observations, any gynecologist would be responsible for noting it. For women over forty with a history of irregular uterine bleeding, any doctor would know to be mindful of tumors. The question of whether one's medical skills are advanced is simply irrelevant.</p>
<p>If they had gone to Shanghai and consulted a reputable and reliable gynecologist who said it wasn't cancer, or if after her death they had an autopsy performed that said it wasn't uterine cancer, then I would willingly accept their scolding. Unfortunately, they did not do that. They do not blame the delay of a certain large hospital, but instead speak ill of me, who had completely fulfilled my duties. Their psychology is truly difficult to understand. Perhaps they feared that the certain large hospital was foreign-run.</p>
<p>Chinese people still view doctors with a perception akin to that of the "three religions and nine streams" (a derogatory term for people of various occupations). Especially doctors in local public hospitals are seen as both traveling healers and public servants. Local gentry call upon them at will, dismiss them at will, criticize them at will, without even asking about the facts. And doctors, upon entering the doors of the gentry, often find that their results are even worse. There must be various causes and effects in this. I recall Guo Yu of the Han Dynasty, who treated the poor and lowly with all his heart and strength, but sometimes could not cure the nobles. He said, "The noble is in a high position and looks down upon his subjects. The subject is fearful and apprehensive. There are four difficulties in treating him, the first being self-serving and not trusting others." Bian Que also had six types of patients he would not treat, one of which was those who were arrogant and did not listen to reason. Two thousand years later, China is still the same. There are many such examples in the world today. No matter how sincerely and truthfully you treat him and tell him the truth, if he is in a bad mood, he will take it out on you. For example, if someone has venereal disease, you examine his urine, test his blood, fulfill your duties completely, and obtain ample evidence to tell him he has gonorrhea or syphilis, he will leave in a rage. People in the world like to be deceived and kept in the dark.</p>

<p>— Gu Shoubai</p>
<p>(V) Organ Therapy and Secretion Theory</p>
<p>In European countries, especially Switzerland and Norway, many residents have very large swellings on the front of their throats; this is goiter. Previously, it was unknown what the thyroid gland did, but in 1883, Reverdin noticed that this gland was closely related to the body. Some patients who had their enlarged thyroid glands removed developed many strange symptoms. Initially, they felt tired, which gradually worsened. Even the slightest effort made them feel exhausted, and all work had to be stopped. At this point, they became completely inactive. At the same time, the feeling of cold gradually increased, and later, the body temperature even dropped below normal. Meanwhile, the subcutaneous tissue gradually expanded with a gelatinous liquid, causing the shape to become swollen and the facial features to change greatly. Due to reduced sweat, the skin became very dry, and mental function also decreased, with dulled comprehension. This disease with these symptoms is called myxedema. Examining the thyroid gland of these patients, it is highly atrophied; therefore, when the thyroid gland is removed or naturally atrophies, these symptoms can be triggered. At this time, injecting an extract of sheep thyroid gland under the skin of these patients can reduce or eliminate these symptoms.</p>
<p>From the above facts and many other observations, it can be known that this thyroid gland can secrete a substance that is transported throughout the body by blood vessels, playing a very important role in both physical and mental aspects. This is evidence of the thyroid gland's obvious endocrine function.</p>
<p>In many places in Europe, regardless of whether there are goiter-affected areas, the physical development of children is often extremely poor; this is called cretinism. There are two different conditions for the occurrence of cretinism: one is accompanied by goiter, and the other is without goiter; the latter is specifically called sporadic cretinism. This condition can also occur in areas without goiter.</p>
<p>Patients with cretinism may reach the age of twenty or so, but their height is only equivalent to that of children in the same family who are twelve or sixteen years younger than them, and the decline in mental development is also the same. They cannot read, and they do not even recognize the alphabet. Their speech is also undeveloped, and their shape is swollen and clumsy. In fact, these patients are representatives of small-scale myxedema. These children with cretinism have no thyroid gland; therefore, we can say that this form of cretinism is caused by congenital lack of the thyroid gland.</p>
<p>If this explanation is correct, then using an extract of the thyroid gland should improve the condition of these sick children. If the patient has not been sick for a long time, approximately after treatment with an appropriate amount of thyroid extract, they can grow rapidly, and mental function can generally develop similarly. The earlier these thyroid agents are used for patients, the more obvious these beneficial effects will be.</p>
<p>When initially considering using thyroid extract to treat myxedema, it was thought that it had to be injected under the skin to be effective. Later, it was learned that simply administering the thyroid extract or the thyroid gland itself orally could also achieve the same effect. In the early stages of human evolution, the thyroid gland once had a duct that could inject secretions into the laryngeal cavity, and people in the past had long known that swallowing the thyroid gland through the mouth had an effect that was very similar to that of subcutaneous injection. Today, this thyroid gland is often taken orally and has long been proven to be of great value for myxedema.</p>
<p>Thyroid extract can also be used for other diseases. For example, it seems to have some effect on certain skin diseases, and for other conditions, it has also been proven that this thyroid extract is useful.</p>
<p>Another example of endocrine function is the so-called adrenal gland. These are small bodies located on the upper end of the left and right kidneys and are not connected. If these organs have pathological changes, especially when the condition is progressing deeply, a strange phenomenon will occur in the body. Patients feel very weak and often have vomiting and anemia. Another more obvious phenomenon is that the surface of the skin shows a dirty bronze color; this disease is called Addison's Disease. These unpleasant symptoms are definitely related to the atrophy of the adrenal gland. It is now known that the function of this adrenal gland is caused by endocrine function. Initially, it was thought to be related to the nervous system, which was naturally wrong.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this adrenal extract has a powerful effect on the body. This substance, called adrenaline, can strongly constrict all small blood vessels, so it is very useful for preventing bleeding from small blood vessels. Scholars have also proven that this extract can constrict peripheral blood vessels to increase blood pressure, so it is quite effective in treating low blood pressure. If the dose of adrenal extract is too large or used for too long, it can cause serious symptoms; this is also something that doctors should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Diabetes, which was always considered to be of unknown cause, was also proven a few years ago by Professor Banting of the University of Toronto in the United States to be caused by endocrine disorders of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. He created a type of insulin to treat severe cases of this disease, which was very effective; this is also a great invention in organ therapy.</p>
<p>(VI) X-rays</p>
<p>In December 1895, a very startling piece of news was suddenly published in German newspapers, saying that Professor Röntgen of the University of Würzburg had discovered a type of light that could penetrate objects; this is what is today called X-rays. Now, I will introduce the process of discovery.</p>
<p>Professor Röntgen has always been very interested in the cathode rays in vacuum tubes studied by Hertz and Lenard. On November 8, 1895, he covered a Crookes vacuum tube with thick black paper and passed an electric current through it. Suddenly, he unintentionally saw a strange dark shadow appear on a piece of paper coated with platinum barium cyanide placed on a chair next to it. The shadow looked like the product of light; however, the vacuum tube was tightly wrapped in thick black paper, so where did the light come from? As a result of his continued research, he determined that it definitely came from the vacuum tube and also knew that it could still emit light even at a distance of two meters. He initially thought that this was a novel light that had not been known by previous people, but since there was no umbra, and it could not be reflected or refracted, it was just a new type of radiation. Later, he carefully studied the nature of this radiation and learned that it had a powerful penetrating force, not only able to penetrate paper, cloth, wood chips, etc., but even human palms and thin metal boxes could be penetrated.

<h3 id="e198">Bed and Coffin <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Both beds and coffins are tools for sleep, but one provides short sleep, and the other provides long sleep. People in the world tend to value coffins and despise beds. The rope beds and bamboo mats of the poor are extremely simple, but once they leave the world forever, the coffin for their long sleep, even if extremely crude, is ultimately worth more than the rope bed or bamboo mat. "The cost of a bed for the rich, even if it reaches tens or hundreds of gold coins, is only for one final farewell. The cost of a coffin is often thousands of gold coins. If steel coffins or glass coffins are used, the cost will be even greater. Not only do ordinary people value coffins and despise beds, but even our Confucius had such thoughts. We can know this from his selling his own carriage to make a coffin for Yan Hui.</p>
<p>I speculate that people despise beds and value coffins because they believe there are all kinds of pleasures in life. At home and away, there are pleasant things everywhere. Only after death will they sleep forever, cut off from all pleasures. They can only give him a good coffin so that he can sleep comfortably and contentedly. In fact, this thought is greatly mistaken. In today's world, it is best to grasp reality in everything. There is no need to chase after the past, and there is no need to speculate about the future.</p>
<p>One should grasp the happiness of reality and not speculate about future happiness. The bed is a real thing, so it should be studied carefully. If you don't have money on hand, selling a good bed should also take seven or eight tenths of the future coffin costs to contribute to it, so that the short sleeping bed is better than the long sleeping coffin.</p>
<p>Some say: Short sleep is temporary death, and long sleep is permanent death. Both are death, and both are death without knowing, so why be generous with the bed and stingy with the coffin? I say: You know one thing but not the other. If you fall into sleep, you will naturally be like the dead and unaware. When getting on the bed, one may not necessarily fall asleep immediately, and there are also those who do not want to fall asleep. A nap at noon is taken to rest. Meeting an old friend, after cutting candles by the west window, continuing with long talks foot to foot. If it is a refined bed, what will the happiness be like? On the bed, there is also the greatest work in the problems of life. If it is not a suitable bed, what is the flaw in perfection? In addition, those who govern people in bed can govern the country and pacify the world in bed. They can also sign armistice agreements in bed, and people even express political views in bed. In short, the function of the bed is not just for temporary death and sleep. As for permanent death, unless your body is like our national father and has the qualifications to not decay, it is worthy of being placed in a good coffin. Otherwise, the remains will decay and disappear in two or three days. Is it worth placing them in a good coffin? Therefore, I advise people to do their best to study their beds before they die. The coffin after death must be frugally entrusted to the children and grandchildren when they are about to die.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Under the Lamp <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Ding'an</p>
<p>Towns and villages are now in the most financially depleted state. Not to mention extravagant consumption, which was abolished long ago. Even the electric lights used for illumination at night have mostly had their lines cut by the company, and they have been changed to kerosene lamps. Some better ones use gasoline lamps, but these are a minority. When the shopkeeper is gloomily under the kerosene lamp at night, tapping the abacus and carefully checking the day's business, the result is a long sigh, because even the capital is not enough to cover expenses.</p>
<p>Farmers, even now in such a civilized society, still adhere to ancient customs. It can be said that some families have absolutely no concept of time. They "work at sunrise and rest at sunset." Therefore, they rarely light lamps at night. Even if they need to use them, they mostly use vegetable oil lamps or red candles. Sometimes when performing martial arts shows or shadow plays in the village, the shadow play, which is made by paper-cut figures threaded on strings and projected onto a sheepskin frame, is lit with smoky kerosene lanterns or red candles.</p>
<p>Our friends in Shanghai can be said to be extremely pleasure-seeking. The bright electric lights, with light bulbs of different sizes, different colors, frosted and milky white, tubular and round, have various types. There are even many differences in the lampshades outside. The waste of a single lamp is so great that comparing it to the people in the interior is probably like the difference between heaven and hell!</p>
<p>People seeking a living in Shanghai are also sighing bitterly. Every day, within the office hours of X a.m. to X p.m., they are accompanied by the long days and electric lights. Thinking of opening electric lights in the house during the daytime has almost become a very common fact. Speaking of it, one can only feel sadness. The eyes of the average young person are under those electric lights every day. In the near future, their eyesight will definitely weaken, and at the very least, they will suffer from eye diseases.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many people who seek pleasure under the lights. Look at the dancers in the dance halls, the gamblers in the casinos, the drinkers in the hotels, the travelers in the inns. They are intoxicated in the vortex of the enchanting lights, unaware of their own needs and how critical the country is, and are wholeheartedly enjoying themselves. I think they should reflect on themselves if they have any sober moments!</p>
<p>Under the bleak and dim alley streetlights, there are singing girls who have lost their youth. Under the store lights of the street stores, there are strong men whose glory has passed. These people, not long ago, were wildly frivolous under the bright electric lights. How long ago was it that the lights are still the same, but people have changed! Oh, lights, lights! Is this your sin, or is it the general population's "self-inflicted sin, unable to live?"</p>

<p>— Anfu</p>
<p>Was it the kindness of friends? They made me almost drunk! In a new autumn evening sky.</p>
<p>With blurred, drunken eyes and staggering steps, I dragged my shadow along the silent sidewalk, swaying; the light breeze slipping down from the treetops kissed my face, kissed my hair, so tender! Like the tenderness of a spring breeze. How fast! Light steps had already carried me to my dwelling.</p>
<p>Who is in my room, the light so bright? When I walked into the bedroom, I realized it was not the lamplight, but the moonlight shining through the glass window. While taking off my coat and changing into my pajamas, I thought, how could I be so muddled tonight, drinking myself so drunk, I should go to bed early! So I climbed into bed. But as soon as I lay down, I felt my nerves twitching especially fast; it felt like something was crawling in my heart, and my mouth seemed to be frying; unable to sleep soundly, I had to get up again. After drinking tea, I pushed open the window, and the flowers, plants, and trees in the neighbor's backyard came into view. Although I was used to seeing them every day, they didn't evoke any special feelings; but in the moonlight, they seemed much quieter and more secluded than in the sunlight, and the most charming were the roses, lowering their heads as if smiling at me. I remembered the garden in my hometown, with flowers, plants, and trees, and in the clear, moonlit nights, I also wandered and pondered. Now, my hometown is far away from me, and in the hazy moonlight, I couldn't help but feel a lingering homesickness.</p>
<p>The wind, a gust colder than the last, flew over my body, and a slight chill permeated my heart. The cry of "Don't catch a cold" was not to be heard, and the person to put a coat on me was not there; besides myself, who else would take care of me? For my own sake, I should add a coat; so I casually took a thicker shirt from the rack and put it on, still leaning against the window, watching the moon in the sky, and listening to the sounds of the insects on the ground.</p>
<p>It must be almost two o'clock, right? The whole city was in silence; in the depths of the branches, there was a corner of a small building, and the light in the building suddenly turned on. On the thin window screen, there was a graceful figure taking off her evening gown, piece by piece; whose daughter was it?</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, one minute, two minutes passed, fifteen minutes passed, and still these two had not returned. Guizhi sat there doing nothing, and Zhao Ziqiang had even less courage to speak. So he coughed a couple of times and sniffled a few times. However, such attempts at conversation took up very little time, and after the sounds passed, he perhaps felt especially bored. Guizhi looked at his appearance, wanting to laugh but unable to. So she took out her handkerchief from her pocket and gently wiped her mouth. Then she raised her hand and patted her hair, turning her face towards the door and saying, "Where did they go? Why is there no news at all?" Zhao Ziqiang took this opportunity and chimed in, "They all like to joke around, maybe they just left." Guizhi lowered her head, raised her eyelids to look at Zhao Ziqiang, and did not say anything. Zhao Ziqiang reached into his pockets and rummaged around, taking out a pack of cigarettes, and then looked around for matches. He struck a match and slowly lit one. He had just exhaled a puff of smoke, and had a sentence he wanted to say, when Guizhi, supporting herself on the edge of the table, suddenly stood up and said to Zhao Ziqiang in a serious tone, "I want to go back." The tone in which she said these words was very firm. However, the voice she uttered was very soft, so soft that almost even she herself could not hear it. But Zhao Ziqiang was very clever this time and actually heard it. He nodded to Guizhi and said, "Sit for a while longer. Maybe they will come back." Guizhi said, "They are deliberately joking around. They have been gone for so long with no news. They won't come back." Zhao Ziqiang had no choice but to stand up and said, "If there is nothing important to do back at your residence, then why not sit for a while longer?" His eyes were watching Guizhi very attentively, but his face was slightly turned away, not looking directly at Guizhi. Guizhi smiled slightly, bit her lip, and sat down again. (183)</p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes can earn rewards of ten thousand or five thousand, so children with runny noses are all smoking cigarettes. I think that in the future, coffin shops and medicine shops will also have prize tickets attached, along with various benefits.</p>
<p>Now, cigarette cases are more valuable than cigarettes because a few cigarette cases offer the hope of hundreds or thousands of yuan, naturally making them as valuable as bank checks.</p>
<p>When I see Lu Gaojian's braised pork hocks, I can't help but think of modern women's jade-like legs.</p>
<p>Speaking of those who advocate nudity, I recall that the son of Little Sanzi from Jiangbei was the originator.</p>
<p>Why is it that rural women exposing their breasts outside is not considered strange, while urban women exposing their breasts is considered sensational news?</p>
<p>Recently, the Wujiang Daily published a news story about an elementary school teacher in Meiyan who, after getting drunk, took off his clothes and pants and walked around the street for a week. This is also an enthusiastic supporter of nudity in the education world. Poor people like to stand in front of restaurant doors, sniffing the aroma, which is the meaning of "feasting from afar at the butcher's gate."</p>
<p>The British Concession and the French Concession are shouted about wildly by the Chinese, clearly indicating that those places are no longer Chinese, what extravagance!</p>

<p>— Runiu</p>
<p>When I watched old Chinese operas in my hometown village, I had not yet been educated to be a "scholar," and the children were mostly farmers. What we loved to watch were somersaults, tiger leaps, and a puff of smoke revealing a demon; the plot didn't seem to have much to do with us. The fight for cities and lands between the Da Mian (painted face) and Laosheng (old male role), and the separations and reunions of the Xiaosheng (young male role) and Zhengdan (main female role), were all their affairs. Children who grasped hoe handles knew that they would never ascend the platform to be generals or go to the capital to take exams. But I still remember a play that moved me, it seemed to be called "Chopping Wood to Show Sincerity." A high official was wrongly accused and was about to be killed, and an old family servant in his family, who looked very similar, went to "face the law" in his place. The tragic actions and songs really touched the hearts of the viewers, making them discover a good model for themselves. Because the farmers in my hometown, once the busy farming season was over, some would go to help the wealthy. In order to act the part, before the execution, the mistress of the house had to "hold the head and cry loudly" as usual, but he kicked her away. Even at this time, the proper roles had to be strictly observed. This was a loyal servant, a righteous person, a good person.</p>
<p>But when I watched movies in Shanghai, I had already become a "lower-class Chinese." Looking at the white people and rich people sitting upstairs, and the middle and lower-class "Chinese stomachs" lined up downstairs, the screen showed white soldiers fighting, white masters getting rich, white ladies getting married, white heroes exploring, making the viewers admire, envy, be terrified, and feel that they could not do it themselves. But when white heroes explored Africa, there was often a black loyal servant who paved the way for him, served him, risked his life, and died for him, allowing the master to return home safely. When he prepared for a second expedition, a loyal servant could no longer be found, so he remembered the deceased, his face darkened, and a black face from his memory appeared on the screen. The viewers also mostly darkened their faces in the dim light: they were moved.</p>
<p>Fortunately, domestic films are also struggling to rise, jumping up and over high walls, raising their hands and throwing out flying swords, but this also withdrew from Shanghai along with the 19th Route Army. Now they are preparing to screen Turgenev's "Spring Torrents" and Mao Dun's "Spring Silkworms." Of course, this is progress. But at this time, there came a heavily promoted "Yao Mountain Love History."</p>
<p>The theme of this film is "civilizing the Yao people," and the key is "recruiting a son-in-law," which reminds people of "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Princess Shuangyang Pursues Di." The great theory that Chinese spiritual civilization dominates the world is not often heard these days. If you want to civilize, you can only retreat to the Miao and Yao people, and to achieve this great cause, you must first "marry." The descendants of the Yellow Emperor, like black people, cannot marry the princesses of European and Asian powers, so spiritual civilization cannot be spread. This is something that everyone can understand from this.</p>

<p>Mr. Suoyuan has published two articles in a row, and I only took the time to respond once. I have answered the two points he raised in the first article one by one. The second article deliberately quibbled and nitpicked, and I also explained it to him. But today (the 7th), I saw that Mr. Suoyuan had come again, saying that I had "not answered" but was "fooling around" with him. In fact, just in the Free Talk publication alone, you gentlemen have come four times in a row, and I have only answered once. If we're talking about "fooling around," I really don't dare to accompany you. As for saying that there is a real argument that wants me to answer, I am willing to join the discussion. So this time, after reading the articles by both Mr. Shi Zhi and Mr. Suoyuan, although I understood a little of the meaning of the two words "fooling around," and felt that the attitude lacked gentlemanly demeanor, I did not use the shield of the son to attack the spear of the son, and take these two words as the topic. The title above is enough to show that I am entirely out of academic discussion, and does not contain the slightest malice.</p>
<p>Mr. Suoyuan said that I acknowledged two points, namely (1) Basic English is not an international language, and (2) the two have their own strengths and weaknesses, and their own grounds. But I did not acknowledge the first point. Ogden created this language entirely for international use, but what we now find most useful in it is its simplicity. As for whether it can achieve the effect of international use, that is even better of two things at once. Why can Basic English be used as an international language? Because in European and American countries, English is commonly spoken, and even in Japan it is possible. A friend of mine travelled in Japan in the first year of the Great Earthquake and used English throughout. What about China? Shanghai is an exception for the moment. Even in the inland, if you are sick and go to the hospital, and you want water when it is hot, no matter how many times you shout "Akvo," it is unlikely that someone will bring you water. In the end, if the nurse gets impatient and comes to interfere, if you say she shouldn't look angry ("Kolera"), she might mistake you for having cholera and give you a few injections of saline. As long as you learn the word "Water" in Basic English, you won't suffer this kind of hardship. It is commonly used in both the East and the West, isn't that an international language?</p>
<p>I learned Esperanto twelve years ago. I know very well the difference between it and Basic English, so I said that each has its strengths and weaknesses, and each has its own grounds. The content of Basic English has been discussed in many books and in Mr. Zhang's articles, so I will not mention it here due to space limitations. Let me talk about the strengths and weaknesses of "Esperanto" and its grounds. Its strength is that its grammar is extremely simple, and the changes are regular. Its weakness is that it is still too early and not widely used. Even the mixing of written and spoken language is too little writing for us to read. As for its grounds, I am afraid that at present it can only be used, as Mr. Suoyuan said, to shout slogans at the International Workers' Games held in Moscow. Because Russian is too difficult, it cannot force people to learn it well, so it uses "Esperanto" to communicate with the proletariat of various countries in the world. So "Moscow Impressions" and "Travels in New Russia" are also made by it.</p>
<p>Mr. Suoyuan said that he agreed with the above two points. Let's talk about the five points that he did not agree with. (1) I have answered the following regarding Basic English's attempt to be an international language. As for Basic English's attempt to be a rationalized scheme for English, which is also his following three or four items, I will now reply in detail separately: Regarding the rationalization of spelling, I have said that even Anglo failed, so Ogden changed his course and started from other aspects. It is well known that getting familiar with something is good, so Basic English does not create new words. Instead of finding a new group of people to learn the word "Rit," it is better to retain the existing five hundred million people who already know the word "Right." This is precisely the rational approach. Habit becomes nature, and nature is the most rational. Foreigners eat bread, Chinese people eat rice, can you say who is irrational? So the spelling "Right" is rational because it evolved from 1610 through various changes of "Riht." If it is changed to "Rit," it becomes unreasonable. As for the exceptions of irregular verbs and the minority of nouns, although they cannot completely conform to the principles of artificial language, they have their own reasons. Some are due to pronunciation. In short, we only need to check the traces of the development of OE, ME, and MlnE to understand. (2) Mr. Suoyuan said that Basic English cannot be separated from ordinary English and cannot replace ordinary English. I cannot agree with this either, because if you learn Basic English, you can speak, write letters, write articles, and use it for various purposes. Why can't it be independent? Even regarding the latter, since we can use Basic English to translate ordinary English books and use it to speak ordinary English, why can't it replace it? Finally, (5) no matter what the environment is, it is in the heart, not in the language, that one wants to subordinate people. Although Japan forced Koreans to learn Japanese, the Koreans were not convinced because of it. Conversely, the Russians can also win over many obedient people by using "Esperanto" instead of their national language.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Autumn Dreams on a Literary Bed <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Youguang</p>
<p>Spring dreams are topsy-turvy. What about "A Midsummer Night's Dream"? Looking at Shakespeare's plays, it is still topsy-turvy. Chinese autumn dreams, as a rule, should be "bleak and chilling." Before the Republic, death row inmates were all "executed after autumn," which was following the seasons. Heaven teaches people to do this, and people cannot but do this. So-called "literati" are of course no exception. Eating their fill and sleeping in bed, the food cannot be completely digested, so they dream, and since it is autumn now, heaven teaches their dreams to be solemn.</p>
<p>In the thirty-first issue of Volume 2 of "Wave Sounds" (published on August 12), there is a letter to the editor from a Mr. "Lin Ding," which says in part:</p>
<p>"...the dispute, who is right and who is wrong, outsiders cannot know the details. However, mutual destruction, as seen by onlookers, cannot but be acknowledged as the misfortune of the entire literary scene... I believe that everyone should first be spanked a hundred times to serve as a warning, and all other matters can be left unmentioned..."</p>
<p>The other day, there was also an unsigned editorial in a certain tabloid, which was also very angry about the Yu-Zhao plagiarism dispute some time ago:</p>
<p>"...if I were to seize power one day, I would definitely arrest these people and sentence them to hard labor, reading books for ten years; the Chinese literary scene might still have a day of cleanliness."</p>
<p>Zhang Xianzhong was about to decline himself, so his actions did not ask "who is right and who is wrong," he simply killed. Qing Dynasty officials, regardless of whether the two parties were right or wrong, did occasionally beat each party a hundred or fifty times, because the Manchus still wanted slaves to provide plunder. This is Mr. "Lin Ding's" old dream. The nameless Mr. in a certain tabloid is even more civilized, at least, he already knows the Shanghai Municipal Council's method of "fining" lower-class Chinese.</p>
<p>But the first question is how can one "seize power one day"? How can weak scholars manage to become powerful ministers? Previously, one could hope to recruit a son-in-law and suddenly rise to prominence, but now there are no emperors, and even if one covers their face with snow cream, they will never encounter the favor of a princess; at most, they can only hope to become the son-in-law of a wealthy family, and the method of buying an official rank has long been abolished. For "great power," one can only look up at the grapes on high like a fox. The integrity and cleanliness of the literary scene is probably very remote.</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, "literary beggars" were discovered in the publishing industry, followed by "literary vagrants." But this kind of imposing figure is what I have newly discovered in Shanghai this autumn. Unable to name them, I will tentatively call them "literary officials." Looking at literary history, the literary scene often has times of integrity and cleanliness, but who has ever seen this purification of the literary scene have the slightest relationship with these kinds of "literary officials"?</p>
<p>However, dreams can always be made, fortunately they don't matter much, and writing them out is interesting. Rest in peace, prospective young masters!</p>

<p>— Zhao Zhengdong</p>
<p>The woman was preparing dinner in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The man came back from outside, leaned against the door frame, and spaced out, with a look of frustration on his face.</p>
<p>"Were the rice plants in the field weighed? How much was it in the end?" the woman asked resentfully.</p>
<p>"Twenty dan, almost," the man's voice was very low, almost inaudible.</p>
<p>"Twenty dan, almost?" the woman stopped her work, staring at the man's face. "Good, twenty mu of land, not even twenty dan! See how you plan to get through this year?"</p>
<p>"..." The man's eyes were closed. But crystal beads had already appeared in his eye sockets.</p>
<p>"I told you not to plant rice, to plant cotton. You didn't listen, saying something about how planting cotton was very risky, and if there was a western flood in the autumn, you wouldn't get anything. Has there been a western flood now?" the woman said, getting angrier and angrier. "You also said something about the chief, something about officials, something about buying a lot of foreign cotton and coming back, saying something about how the price of cotton this year was sure to be cut. You wanted to plant rice. Now planting rice is good, not even eight dou per mu, but paying the rent takes one dan; and there are still debts to be paid, and busy work has to be paid for! See what you're going to do?"</p>
<p>"How did I know that the rice would have so many weeds? I'm not a god," he was a little embarrassed and angry, his eyes widening, and several crystal beads rolled down one after another. "Who wants you to be a god! If you had listened to me and planted cotton, it wouldn't be like this."</p>
<p>"What else are you going to say? It's already the plaque in the City God Temple, 'It's too late to regret.' We'll plant cotton next year."</p>
<p>"Next year! But how are we going to get through this year?"</p>
<p>"If we can't get through it, we'll die!"</p>

<p>— Written by Joseph Conrad of England, translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>The white man rested his arms on the top of the small cabin at the stern of the boat, and said to the helmsman:</p>
<p>"Let's spend the night at the Asata settlement. It's getting late." The Malay only responded with a sound, and continued to stare at the water. The white man put his chin on his crossed arms, watching the waves stirred up by the hull of the boat. At the end of the straight row of trees, which were cut off by the shimmering of the river, the sun, as if not covered by clouds, dazzled the eyes, and rested low on the water, the surface of the water was as smooth as a metal band. The forest, gloomy and dark, stood quietly on both sides of the wide river. Next to the towering giant tree roots, a kind of palm tree without a trunk, supporting heavy clusters of large leaves, grew out of the mud on the shore, motionless and suspended over the swirling water. In the still air, every tree, every leaf, every branch, and every small petal, seemed to be frozen in a state of complete stillness as if by magic. On the water, apart from the eight oars that regularly flashed and rocked up, and then splashed into the water together, there was nothing else moving; at the same time, the helmsman quickly and regularly used force to swing his paddle left and right, drawing a shining semicircle over his head. The stirred-up river water made a chaotic gurgling sound, washing up foam along the river bank. Thus, the white man's canoe proceeded between the momentary whirlpools stirred up by itself, as if entering the port of a land that was forever separated from the memory of turbulence.</p>
<p>The white man, turned his back to the setting sun, watching the empty and vast water surface. About in this last three-mile journey, the turbulent river, as if powerless to resist, was seduced by the free and vast horizontal line, and flowed straight into the sea, straight to the east 丨丨 to the east that contains light and shadow. At the stern, towards a small bird's frequent cry 丨丨 a disharmonious and weak chirping, before he reached the other side, it brushed across the flat water surface and disappeared into the silence of the surrounding nature.</p>
<p>The helmsman, held the paddle tightly with his stiff arm, paddling in the water, his body bent forward. The water made a gurgling sound; suddenly the straight river line seemed to spin from the center, the forest swayed in a semicircle, and then the slanting light of the setting sun, emitting a fiery red glow, shone on the side of the canoe, and projected the slender and crooked shadows of the sailors on the shimmering river. The white man looked up ahead. The progress of the boat changed direction, forming a right angle with the river, and the carved dragon head of the bow turned to the gap in the bushes surrounding the river bank. The boat glided, skimming over the thin branches hanging in the air, disappearing from the river as if a slender amphibious animal was about to leave the water and seek a den in the forest.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Foreign Trade This Year and Speculations on the Future <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Pei</p>
<p>The Customs Statistical Abstract has already published monthly figures for foreign trade in the first half of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). In these past six months, looking at the present and reflecting on the past, we cannot help but feel pessimistic. Although the economic depression of the world is a common phenomenon in various countries, and China cannot escape this exception, our country's trade is, proportionally, trending downwards. In the past two years, the low silver price has indeed been a great opportunity to promote export trade. At the same time, the Chinese people have spared no effort in promoting domestic goods, which should have resulted in considerable progress. However, with the decline of industry and commerce and the withering of all trades, export trade is becoming more and more sluggish. This situation is a full manifestation of the decline of our national economy, and we should not shy away from admitting it.</p>
<p>The total trade volume for the first half of this year: exports were valued at more than 296.46 million yuan, and imports were valued at more than 396.07 million gold units, equivalent to more than 771.10 million national currency yuan, totaling more than 1,067.57 million yuan. In the first half of last year (1932), foreign trade: exports were 29.89 million taels of Customs silver, equivalent to 465.72 million national currency yuan, and imports were 52.905 million gold units, equivalent to 945.879 million yuan, totaling more than 1,411.599 million yuan. Comparing the two years, trade this year, both exports and imports, have decreased. Exports decreased by 169.254015 million yuan, imports decreased by 174.770915 million yuan, and the total decreased by 344.024930 million yuan. In other words, exports decreased by 36.34 percent, imports decreased by 18.48 percent, and the total decreased by 24.38 percent. According to the trade statistics report of the International Trade Bureau, comparing the first six months of this year with the same months of last year, during the six months, the highest export volume was only equal to 83.33 percent of the same month last year (January), and the lowest was only equal to 48.00 percent of the same month last year (April). The highest import volume exceeded the same month last year by 18.66 percent (only in February), and the lowest was only equal to 62.99 percent of the same month last year (January). The total highest only exceeded the same month last year by 2 percent, and the lowest was only equal to 66.34 percent of last year. The degree of difference from last year is obvious. Some say that this year's trade statistics cannot be compared equally with last year because the reports from the Northeast Customs are incomplete. If the Northeast Customs are included, the trade figures may even be higher than this year. Let us try to compare again by including the Northeast Customs. According to the investigation, in the first six months of last year, the figures for the Northeast Customs were: exports valued at 198,450,504 yuan, imports valued at 113,605,993 yuan, totaling 312,056,497 yuan. If we assume that the reported figures of the Northeast Customs in this year's trade are still comparable to last year, and include them in the calculation of last year's figures, then the trade in the first six months of this year should be: exports 494,917,023 yuan, imports 884,714,078 yuan, totaling 1,379,631,101 yuan. Comparing this number with the first half of the year, exports increased by 29.196 million yuan, imports decreased by 61.1649 million yuan, and the total decreased by 31.968 million yuan, which is still 2.27 percent lower than last year. It is even more obvious that this year's trade is not as good as last year. Moreover, the increase in trade in the southern customs since last year has a considerable impact on the seizure of the Northeast Customs. Although the extent of the impact cannot be determined, it does not seem too low to add the figures of the Northeast Customs. This is another point that we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Among the figures calculated by including the Northeast Customs, export trade should have increased by 29 million yuan compared to last year, and the situation is more advanced than last year. However, according to the actual figures for this year, exports decreased by 36 percent, which is more than imports. The reason is that the quantity of exports in the Northeast Customs is large, and soybeans alone account for a large proportion of our country's exports. The seizure of the Northeast Customs means that the soybean trade is equal to zero. Previously accounting for more than 15 percent of the total export value, it now accounts for only 0.73 percent. This has a major impact on this year's export trade. This is why the figures including the Northeast Customs exceed last year. Now, let's try to compare the figures excluding the Northeast Customs. In the first six months of last year, excluding the Northeast Customs, exports should have been 267.27 million yuan, imports should have been 832.273 million yuan, and the total should have been 1,099.543 million yuan. Comparing the upper period of this year with the same period last year, exports should increase by 10.92 percent, imports should decrease by 7.35 percent, and the total should decrease by 2.97 percent. This point also shows that, judging from the proportion, the progress of export trade is indeed better than import trade, which is quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>The deficit in the first half of this year was 474.641566 million yuan, compared to 30.8189 million taels of Customs silver last year, equivalent to 480.158467 million yuan. The number this year is slightly lower by more than 5.517 million yuan. However, the percentage of deficit is higher than last year. The deficit in the first half of this year accounted for 61.55 percent of the total import value, while last year it accounted for 50.76 percent, which is enough to prove the high proportion of deficit this year. However, we should also pay attention to the fact that the figures of the Northeast Customs are not within the scope of this year's report. If the figures of the Northeast Customs are included, the deficit this year should account for 44.06 percent of the total import value, which is lower than the proportion of deficit last year. If the Northeast Customs are excluded, the deficit in the first half of last year should be 565 million yuan, accounting for 67.89 percent of the import value, and the degree of deficit is obviously higher than this year. From this situation, the seriousness of the deficit problem this year does not seem to exceed that of last year, and the situation is the same as export trade.</p>
<p>It is still difficult to predict the amount of the deficit this year. If we infer from the increase or decrease ratio of each quarter of last year, the third quarter decreased by 32.95 percent compared to the second quarter, and the fourth quarter decreased by 4.48 percent compared to the third quarter. If there is no special change in the second half of this year, and the trade pattern is roughly the same as last year, then the estimated deficit for the whole year this year will be more than 828.7 million yuan, or equal to more than 531.93 million taels of Customs silver, which is slightly lower than the deficit of 556,605,240 taels of Customs silver last year. However, this is under the circumstance that the export figures of the Northeast Customs have fallen miserably. However, what we should pay attention to in the trade in the second half of this year is the 50 million US dollars of cotton and wheat loans. The import of cotton and wheat should increase significantly. Even if not all of it is imported, the amount of the deficit may reach 900 million yuan, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>In our country's foreign trade, Japan has always ranked first. Since last year, the United States has taken the first place, increasing from 18.85 percent (in the 20th year of the Republic) to 21.16 percent (percentage of total trade value), while Japan has decreased from 23.93 percent (in the 20th year of the Republic) to 16.45 percent. In the first half of this year, the United States still ranks first, and Japan ranks second, but the percentages have both decreased. The United States accounts for 19.85 percent (20.94 percent in the same period last year), and Japan accounts for 10.91 percent (18.20 percent in the same period last year). The changes in trade with China by the two countries are huge. Compared with the same period last year, the export ratio of the United States has increased almost doubled, while the import has decreased from 26.51 percent to 20.37 percent. For Japan, the export ratio has decreased from 25.50 percent to 15.11 percent, and the import has decreased from 14.58 percent to 9.31 percent. Other countries, such as Australia, have increased the ratio from 3.04 percent in the same period last year to 7.55 percent, and Russia has decreased from 2.99 percent to 1.63 percent, of which exports have decreased from 7.62 percent to 1.12 percent, and imports have increased from 0.75 percent to 1.83 percent. The decrease in exports should be due to the impact of the Northeast issue. Only the United Kingdom has maintained its original state, with almost no increase or decrease. According to the trade trend this year, the United States' position in the first place is undoubtedly beyond doubt, and with the addition of cotton and wheat loans, the import ratio should increase even more. Even if Japan's trade does not retreat to the third place, the ratio with the United Kingdom will not be far apart. There will not be the high ratio as before. However, this is not Japan's loss, but due to the seizure of the Northeast Customs. Russia has changed from export surplus to import surplus, which has been proved by statistical facts. In the future, even if the export of Chinese goods increases slightly, its ratio will be far less than the speed of import of Russian goods, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's foreign trade has had a phenomenon of increasing year by year. In the 20th year of the Republic, it reached the highest number in history, valued at more than 234 million taels of Customs silver. Last year, due to the occurrence of the January 28th Incident and the Rehe Incident, and the incompleteness of the Northeast Customs reports, it fell miserably to more than 154.18 million taels of Customs silver. In the upper period of this year's trade, due to the lack of reports from the Northeast Customs, it has decreased by 34.4 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Even if there is a slight increase in the lower period, the total may be difficult to exceed 220 million yuan, equivalent to more than 141.2 million taels of Customs silver. It is still less than last year, and the decrease should be more than 12.98 million taels of Customs silver, which may be the lowest number in nearly 17 years. In terms of deficit, due to the loss of major exports from the Northeast, it may reach a huge number of 900 million yuan, which is not only the highest number in history, but also exceeds the proportion of last year by a large margin. In the total trade volume of 150 million taels of Customs silver last year, the deficit accounted for 35 percent, while this year it may account for more than 40 percent of the total trade volume. At this critical moment, if the people of the country do not quickly seek remedy, the overseas market may no longer have a foothold for our country's commodities.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Various Countries' Rejection of Japanese Goods and Japan's Defensive War <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Fan</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in Northeast China, the ferocious face of Japanese imperialism has been revealed to the world. The movement in our country to resist Japanese goods has also become more concrete and widespread. The sales of Japanese goods have suffered an extreme blow, and Japan's export trade has naturally been greatly affected. As a result, difficulties in the operation of various industries have increased, and the number of unemployed has surged. At the same time, panic has spread in the financial and fiscal sectors. The disastrous fall in the international value of Japanese currency and the flight of genuine goods overseas have also become inevitable results. Therefore, in December 1931, Japan decisively banned gold exports again, adopting a policy of currency inflation as a countermeasure to this panic. It used the decline in foreign exchange rates to cause a sharp drop in the prices of Japanese goods in overseas markets and used dumping policies to open up new overseas markets. As a result, it succeeded in stabilizing old markets and expanding new markets in places as near as India, Southeast Asia, and South Africa, and as far as the Mediterranean and South America. In particular, Japan's dumping policies in British colonies have eroded a significant portion of the British goods market.</p>
<p>This inevitably provoked fierce competition between British and Japanese goods. This competition became a movement in Britain to resist Japanese goods, further escalating from an economic struggle to a political one. The first battle in Britain's movement to resist Japanese goods began with India's revision of cotton textile tariffs before the Ottawa Conference in July and August 1932 had concluded. At that time, India's revised cotton textile tariffs were 25% for British products and 50% for all other foreign products. Previously, the difference in tariff rates between British products and products from other countries was only 11.2%, but now it had suddenly increased to 25%. The second battle was the termination of the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty on April 10, 1933. This was followed by the enactment of the Indian Industrial Protection Act on April 12. On June 6, based on this law, the tariffs on cotton textiles from countries other than the seven British nations were raised to 75%, which was the highest tariff rate, effectively prohibiting imports. This was not only the case in India. In Egypt, in May 1933, tariffs on cotton yarn and cotton cloth from countries other than Britain were also increased. On June 15, the Malay Peninsula implemented tariff increases on cotton cloth imports, with a 10% increase on British products, and a 30% increase on high-quality Japanese products, and 70-80% on low-quality products. On June 26, in the British-controlled areas of East Africa, tariffs on cotton textiles and rayon textiles were increased by 20% to 50%. On June 31, the state government of Horwell imposed tariffs on cotton textiles, rubber shoes, condensed milk, canned goods, and other food products from countries other than Britain, while British products were exempt from all taxes. East Africa also imposed the same taxes on Japanese goods as on the highest-priced British cotton textiles. On July 3, New Zealand merchants petitioned for a movement to prevent Japanese goods, and West Africa even abolished previous commercial treaties. From the facts presented above, it can be seen that Britain's rejection and resistance to Japanese goods is spreading like wildfire, expanding and progressing without pause.</p>
<p>From Britain's motivation to build tariff barriers in India, extending to a thorough rejection of Japanese goods throughout its colonies, this is a well-planned and systematic containment and strangulation of Japan's external economy. With such concrete steps in Britain's movement to resist Japanese goods, the economic struggle between Britain and Japan is not only actively mobilizing individual sectors, but in reality, the entire economic front is engaged in a fierce war with short weapons and artillery fire.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The so-called economic struggle between Britain and Japan is, in other words, merely a self-defense measure by the mighty British Empire against the activities of Japanese goods. This suggests that Japanese goods must have a strong presence in overseas markets. To answer this question, it is best to quote the contents of the "Survey Report on British-Japanese Industrial Competition" by the Special Investigation Committee of the British Industries Federation:</p>
<p>"(1) Over the next 20 to 30 years, Japan's population is expected to increase by approximately 15 million to 30 million, but its domestic resources can only support a portion of its population. Therefore, the competition of Japanese goods overseas is an inevitable and unquestionable fact.</p>
<p>(2) The tariff barriers of European and American countries are increasing day by day, and Japan is gradually expanding the scope of its exported goods. Therefore, Japan must seize every opportunity to engage in fierce competition with various manufactured goods in the international market.</p>
<p>(3) In order to compete with various countries, Japan does not hesitate to use various means. In the past year, it has consciously used the decline of the Japanese yen to recklessly launch a national sales policy to threaten markets around the world. The first to suffer are the British, but no other trading nation is unaffected.</p>
<p>(4) Differences in wages, labor conditions, and living standards, etc. In terms of the main component of labor costs, commodities, the East and the West cannot compete under the same conditions. To give a relevant example, Japan's rayon industry exports have increased ninefold in the past six years, while Britain's exports have decreased by two-thirds during the same period.</p>
<p>(5) The impact of Japanese attacks on British manufacturers is not limited to rayon and crude cotton textile industries, but also extends to heavy chemical industry products, light bulbs, bicycles, buttons, cement, rubber shoes, etc.</p>
<p>(6) The reasons why Japanese goods are able to drive out British goods: the first and foremost reason is wages, working hours, and labor conditions, etc., because the living standards in the East are extremely low; the second reason is the decline in exchange rates and the implementation of government export subsidies and freight dumping. These are the 'unfair' advantages enjoyed by Japanese exporters.</p>
<p>(7) If there is no joint action or plan to protect the interests of Britain in the British homeland and its colonies; if the competition of Japanese goods is allowed to continue without any attempt to resist it, then the British industrial protection policy and the plan decided by the Ottawa Conference will be equivalent to zero."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Special Investigation Committee of the Industries Federation, after the aforementioned report, made the following criticisms regarding Japan's labor conditions, and the main points are extracted below:</p>
<p>"(1) Behind the competition of Japanese goods is a large, productive, low-wage labor force. At least their living standards are one-third lower than the labor conditions in Western Europe; and in addition to low wages and labor conditions, Japanese exports are also artificially protected by the state, with special tariffs, subsidies, and state guarantees of profits.</p>
<p>(2) Certain Japanese goods are exempt from income tax for the first four years after the establishment of the factory. The activities of trade commissioners abroad, under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Commerce, are also most noteworthy.</p>
<p>(3) Japan's subsidies for ocean-going ships, except for those during the years of 1915-1918 and 1920 when the situation was relatively difficult, are enormous subsidies granted by the Japanese government to ocean-going shipping companies, so that they are exempt from various losses, and the number is extremely large.</p>
<p>(4) It is foreseeable that Japan will continue to skillfully use its exchange rate market prices to help the development of its trade.</p>
<p>(5) Japan's cotton textile industry benefits greatly from the surplus of women, while male workers' wages account for only one-third of the British wage rate, and female workers' wage rate is only one-quarter.</p>
<p>(6) Many other Japanese industries still fall within the realm of household industries, such as the porcelain industry, which is noteworthy. According to British manufacturers' reports, Japanese products sold in various markets of the British Empire are priced at less than half the price of British industrial products."</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The main themes of the economic struggle between Britain and Japan are extremely clear after reading the above report. However, Britain has even more advanced strategies for its struggle against Japan. The following is an excerpt from a speech by Samuel Hanbury in the British House of Commons:</p>
<p>"The competition of Japanese goods is by no means just ordinary commercial competition. It is attacking foreign markets with the creed of economic aggression, concentrating all means to achieve their goals, deliberately enforcing currency inflation, and infringing upon the trademark rights of other countries. Japan wants to dominate the East and even hold the reins of the world market! Our first step is to conclude reciprocal agreements between Britain and its dominions; secondly, to conclude reciprocal tariff agreements with countries such as France, Belgium, and Italy, which are related to the colonial market. We should also seize the opportunity to determine a new direction for British foreign policy; and at the same time, we must have a closer partnership with the United States. I earnestly hope that the government will adopt a consistent approach to deal with the current problems, and make efforts to fight head-on with Japan's fragmentary solutions in a resolute and decisive manner." We can also see from this speech that Britain's movement to resist Japan is becoming more and more acute and concrete. Since the formation of the British economic nationalism group, it has progressed more organizedly, and the economic struggle against Japan has also reached its final stage.</p>
<p>Originally, the formation of the British economic nationalism group, as mentioned above, was the fact decided by the Ottawa Conference in July 1933. Its main points are: to adopt free trade within the British Empire and protectionist trade for countries outside the Empire. In other words, the British homeland, its autonomous territories, and various colonies form a single entity, while building high tariff barriers to prevent foreign goods from outside British territory from crossing the line. In order to determine and complete this policy, Australia, South Africa, India, and other places have implemented this policy one after another. The aforementioned increase in tariff rates and the abolition of commercial treaties with Japan are the results of implementing this group economy.</p>
<p>The implementation of British group economic nationalism directly dealt a fatal blow to the overseas invasion of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the British nationalist economic group strategy, economic groups in European and American countries have also formed one after another, and it has now become a popular strategy in the world. Here is an introduction to the trend of these economic groups.</p>
<p>Portugal, from June 1, 1933, held a colonial conference, and on July 10, revised the decree for the purpose of unifying colonies, revising preferential tariffs between the country and its colonies, and establishing a colonial tariff committee to expand the protective tariffs of various colonies, and decided on the protection of navigation between colonies and its home country and the necessary facilities.</p>
<p>The three small countries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia held a group economic conference and reached an agreement on tariffs and monetary policies.</p>
<p>Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries that maintained the gold standard formed a gold standard group economy. The French Prime Minister also clearly stated in a speech on July 9 that the French economic group already had a considerable plan.</p>
<p>The United States, on July 7, notified its withdrawal from the "Treaty on the Abolition of Import and Export Prohibitions and Restrictions" established by the League of Nations in 1927; on July 12, it successively met with representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, and other South American countries to discuss closer trade relations and negotiate agreements. At the same time, it also expressed the opinion that tariffs on silk and other related items could be prepared for increase.</p>
<p>Recently, Germany has also felt that Japanese goods are not only invading their own country, but also gradually encroaching on their economic territory elsewhere. Recently, they have also been cooperating with European and American countries to prepare for an effective response to Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Looking at the facts listed above, countries around the world are rapidly forming economic groups in various forms. The occurrence of this phenomenon is, on the one hand, due to the failure of this World Economic Conference, which inevitably led to the strengthening of economic nationalism; but on the other hand, it must also be said to be a defensive movement due to the excessive activity of Japanese imperialist goods in overseas markets. Therefore, in the future, Japanese goods will not only be subjected to Britain's fierce resistance movement, which will deal a fatal blow from the front; but countries around the world will also adopt a defensive movement of encirclement and attack, so that Japanese goods can no longer be active in places of concern to various countries. This is an inevitable trend. Therefore, the impact on Japan after the economic grouping and the strengthening of economic nationalism in various countries can certainly be predicted.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>What defensive strategies will Japan use against the movement to resist Japanese goods in various countries around the world? Naturally, the biggest enemy at present is Britain, so it initially used political means to establish the first act of the confrontation war against Britain.</p>
<p>The first act of this war is the issue of India's abolition of the commercial treaty and the increase in tariffs. At the time of the abolition of the treaty, it lodged strong protests, and used various methods through its ambassadors and consuls abroad to make direct and indirect negotiations. At the same time, yarn manufacturers agreed to not buy or sell Indian cotton as a retaliatory measure against Britain and India. Although the Indian and Japanese authorities are currently preparing to hold some kind of cooperation conference, this is foreseeable. While Britain and Japan are engaged in an economic confrontation war, this part of the cooperation agreement has no possibility of easing.</p>
<p>However, what general defensive measures will Japan take after being hit by the British economic group and the economic groups of various countries? Naturally, there is no other direction, and they will inevitably move towards the so-called Japanese-Manchu economic group or East Asian economic group that they are currently calling for. The northeastern provinces are already under the iron fist of Japanese imperialism, and they are using Chinese puppets to develop as much as possible all the information they can use for their activities and all means of exploitation. This piece of fat meat in China is naturally under the covetous gaze of Japanese imperialism, which will not be satisfied until it obtains it, while other imperialists are also actively preparing to become a target for contention.</p>
<p>However, specifically speaking of the so-called Japanese-Manchu economic group, if it progresses according to Japan's plan, it is actually directly colliding with the economic groups of various countries. Not only will the economic struggle between Britain and Japan, but also the economic struggle against the world, inevitably become deeper and more serious.</p>
<h3 id="e210">China's Foreign Trade and Domestic Trade <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Fa</p>
<p>At this year's annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society, some people raised the issue of China's international trade and domestic trade, believing that there was no hope for the development of foreign trade, and that it would be better to improve domestic trade. A significant part of U.S. President Roosevelt's plan to revive American industry is also to protect and develop its domestic market. This is a question worth discussing, especially when international capitalism is working hard to go backwards.</p>
<p>Originally, foreign trade and domestic trade are not opposing terms, but rather the result of related economic development. In primitive times, there was no such thing as trade. Subsequently, the division of labor occurred between families, and then between clans and nations, and exchange relations occurred between them; until the form of the state, domestic trade occurred. The development of capitalism in the eighteenth century led to competition in foreign markets between countries. Not only did the international division of labor in production become a necessary condition for capitalism in various countries, but foreign markets also became the lifeline of each capitalist country. Therefore, international trade is only the progression or expansion of domestic trade that comes with economic development.</p>
<p>The reason why international trade has become the lifeline of capitalist countries is because of the development of industry. Developed industrial countries, on the one hand, need to promote the sales of their industrial products, and on the other hand, need to obtain raw materials, that is, they must develop international trade. Therefore, countries that have international trade relations with other countries can be divided into two categories: one is industrial countries, whose international trade is active, and can also be said to be aggressors; the other is agricultural countries with backward industries, whose entry into the vortex of international trade is forced, and can also be said to be invaded.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, China belongs to the latter category of countries in its international trade relations with other countries. China's closed-door barriers were initially opened by British cannons. In the early days of the intrusion of various countries' economic forces, the Chinese government and people had strong resistance, but they were finally assimilated in the torrent of international trade. Naturally, in international trade, the task that China fulfills is only to "absorb industrial manufactured goods and supply raw agricultural products." In this "unequal value" transaction, China has been exploited by the great powers.</p>
<p>But now, the situation has changed. The international market is becoming increasingly narrow, tariff wars between countries are intensifying, and Cunliffe even believes that world trade is "disappearing." Before the end of World War II and the clear division of the second world market, it is very obvious that although China wants to increase its obligation to "absorb manufactured goods and supply raw materials," it is also unable to do so.</p>
<p>Now, when there is no opportunity to develop foreign markets, countries are protecting their domestic markets. China's situation differs from other countries in two points, and these two characteristics make it more necessary and beneficial for China to protect and develop its domestic market.</p>
<p>First, China is mainly an agricultural country, and does not have industrial products that must seek foreign markets. The importance of its need for international trade is naturally less.</p>
<p>Second, China is a huge "import surplus country." If it can protect its domestic market and eliminate the dumping of foreign goods, this huge "import surplus" is enough for the market development of domestic industries.</p>
<p>Therefore, if it can eliminate foreign aggression, China's domestic trade is more important than foreign trade.</p>
<p>However, protecting and developing the domestic market also requires methods. Now, the "virgin land" of the four northeastern provinces, which has always been regarded as a great market for developing Chinese industry, is under the iron heels of the Japanese. It is reported that Yunnan is also in danger and may not escape being a sequel to the Northeast. Qingdao, an important commercial port in the central region, also has terrible rumors. In the situation where the land, which is one of the three essential elements of nation-building, cannot be guaranteed, it is difficult to protect the domestic market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the banks again encountered the usual Sunday, and the market situation was naturally quiet. Various collections and deliveries were also stopped as usual, so there seemed to be little to record in the manuscript. The market price of foreign call loans in the market greatly decreased due to the closing of customs and the small number of funds available. There were very few inquiries about the aspects of import and export. Yesterday, it only opened at 0.04, which was a sharp decrease of 0.05 compared to the previous day. The situation was indescribable. The turnover of bills was more than 1.5 million in the morning session and more than 1.1 million in new transactions. In the afternoon session, the turnover was more than 600,000, and in the small general meeting, it was more than 200,000. The collection and delivery of foreign public bills by money houses seemed to be more than 35 million due to the ratio period. The collection and delivery of remittance from various routes was more than 200,000. The new currency demand from customers was 200,000. In terms of auxiliary currency, the Jiangnan small foreign rate remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon sessions were both 839.9 yuan. The turnover was 6,500 in the morning session and 3,000 in the afternoon session. The Guangdong small foreign rate was 713.2 yuan in the morning session and 793.5 yuan in the afternoon session. As a result, it was 1.5 yuan higher than the afternoon session of the previous day. The turnover was 90,000 in the morning session and 45,000 in the afternoon session. The price of copper coins plus length was 800 coins, totaling 315,500 coins. The turnover was more than 35,300 strings, with a total price of 11,200 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<p>=Initially Fell for Four Consecutive Days Due to Numerous Rumors=</p>
<p>=Continued with Short Covering, a Small Recovery=</p>
<p>Last week, from September 4th to 9th, the Hua Merchants Securities Market, after a full week, although it had resumed full-day four-session trading, the trend was still unremarkable. Daily fluctuations did not exceed half a yuan, making for a larger range of fluctuations. Generally, declines outweighed gains. Initially, the market price fell repeatedly due to the failure to quell the Min communists and the failure to reorganize the "96" bond. Subsequently, the Lushan Conference was quite successful, and a small recovery occurred. However, it is still not considered a transition to a rising trend, because there are many reforms after the Lushan Conference, and there are still many twists and turns in the future of market prices. On Monday, the market resumed full-day trading with two futures sessions each in the morning and afternoon, but trading was still light. Market prices continued to fluctuate, with only a difference of about 0.1 yuan between the morning and afternoon. From Tuesday to Thursday, one reason was that the Min rebellion was rampant, and people were timid. Another reason was that the reorganization of the "96" bond became a bubble again. Bulls gradually came out, and the Lushan Conference was just beginning, with different opinions still in the southwest. Therefore, the market showed an oversupply every day. Although large households had entries and exits, they ultimately sold more than they bought, and the price fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan to about 0.5 yuan every day. On Friday and Saturday, the Lushan Conference concluded successfully, and the market rose slightly due to short covering. The two days collectively rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.5-0.6 yuan. The trend is still weak, and there are many waves in the future. As a result of the weekly market prices, the average decline was 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.45 yuan. However, the "96" bond has fallen by more than 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 43,686,000 yuan.</p>

As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by 13 to 19 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 6 points, and futures prices fell by 7 to 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 13 points. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to short covering. As a result, Pingar rose by 1 rupee, Omra fell by 0.75 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by 1 rupee.

<p>(Shaoxing Autumn Cocoon Prices Rise) This year's autumn cocoons in the four villages of Shaoxing are abundant and of good quality. Cocoon merchants are vying to purchase them. Farmers believe that autumn leaf prices are high this year and the cost of silkworms is higher, so they are willing to sell them at high prices. Therefore, although the goods arriving in the market recently are still not weak, the price of cocoons is expected to rise. The price of good cocoons has opened at 45-46 yuan.</p>
<p>(New York Raw Silk Consumption Decreases Significantly) In the middle of last month, strikes in New York silk factories occurred frequently, and the consumption of raw silk decreased significantly.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw limited activity. The Public Association's pricing trend was flat. Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was priced at 21 yuan and 6.5 角, up 7 分 from the previous (8th) day, with only 50 bags traded. Dutch Red PK mark and MKGA mark both fell by 1 角 from 16 yuan and 6.5 角. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 21 yuan and 8 角, with some transactions. Chinese Guohua refined white sugar wanted to raise the price by 1.5 角, with Grade 1 called for 20 yuan and 7.5 角, but no transaction was made.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources. Both retail and wholesale sales were slightly better than before, with a total of 1,600 to 1,700 bags of Yantai rice passing through. Therefore, the situation slightly improved, but ultimately, due to flat consumer sentiment, the market remained stable. Therefore, there were no significant changes in the prices of various types of thick japonica, thin rice, Du Yangjian, and Xin Jian. The price of metavariant remained weak and fell by several 角. He Xia's new japonica rice turned flat, and Changdong's new rice also remained stable.</p>

<h3 id="e217">On Selfishness Qian Xu <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Some people say, "China is bound to perish." Others say, "If China doesn't perish, there's no justice in the world." Although the wording differs, their prediction of China's inevitable demise is the same. The reasons these "prophets" give for China's demise are nothing more than the habits—or rather, the deeply ingrained flaws—of the Chinese people: a tendency towards selfishness and self-interest, a rush to be first, individualism, an inability to think about the big picture, shortsightedness, and so on. These "prophets," observing these phenomena, which are almost universal, feel pessimistic and sigh loudly. In their pessimism and lamentation, they even start to "assimilate," walking down the path of selfishness, rushing to be first, individualism... and deeply feel that old China is beyond redemption.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Chinese are a bit selfish... At train stations, tram stops, post offices, banks, and various public places, who doesn't want to be the first to buy a ticket and get on the vehicle? Who doesn't want to be the first to get their business done? Even in cinemas or classrooms without assigned seats in a school, who doesn't rush in to occupy the best seat? Focusing on personal comfort, they naturally can't consider the convenience of others. Under these circumstances, our "prophets" also realize that being too "foolish" isn't the way to go, so they cleverly, instinctively, and bravely become just as "selfish." Their reason for "assimilation" is, "Everyone else is doing it, why should I be a fool?" At the same time, they lament "the decline of morality" to show that they didn't originally want to be "like this," but are merely "imitating."</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people's deep-seated flaws don't stop there. Even after the loss of the four northeastern provinces, the people in Shanghai continue to sing, dance, and indulge in extravagance, as if nothing has happened. The sound of cannons can't awaken them from their dreams of getting rich, and hot blood can't excite their numbed minds! Even now, many people are still dreaming of making a fortune of 500,000 yuan! Our "prophets" may unfortunately be proven right!</p>
<p>Will China really perish? Based on an organization built on "selfishness," China will indeed perish.</p>
<p>How can we become "unselfish"? It can only start with oneself. If you wait until others are unselfish before you become unselfish, it will never happen. Only when everyone can eliminate the concept of "selfishness" will there be no more problems. There will be no need to chant high-sounding slogans of struggle and sacrifice. However, there may be so-called "clever people" who laugh, laughing at you all as "fools." However, in these times, what is needed are precisely "fools"—utter fools who can shoulder great responsibilities. "Clever people" should only be given the punishment of "exile."</p>
<h3 id="e218">Economics and Power 人 <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>I believe that no matter what you want to accomplish, if you don't have "economics," you can't do anything.</p>
<p>At a school's administrative meeting, an incident occurred involving a conflict between "economics" and "power." The school's finances are not considered wealthy, because it is still in a period of struggle and effort, which I should first explain. Near the end of the meeting, a Dean of Students suggested to the Principal that a fixed portion of the budget be allocated as office expenses for the Dean of Students Office. The reason was, "You can't achieve results without money; if you have no control over the budget, then even if you plan the entire strategy, it will be a waste of effort and never be implemented. If you just muddle through and treat it as an empty formality, you can't justify your responsibility." The Principal's response was as follows: "Because our school is still newly established, it's natural that we aren't financially abundant. Although the office expenses for each 'department' should be clearly allocated, under our current circumstances, everyone should consider the facts and understand together. Because we want to make every effort to push the school forward, if there is something the Dean of Students Office needs to do that the school can afford, then we can just do it. If we think it's necessary but the school's finances make it impossible, then we'll put it on hold for now."</p>
