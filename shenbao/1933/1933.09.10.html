<h3 id="c8">康藏形勢之急劇化都 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>國勢陵夷。邊事日亟。東北問題。巳不堪問。蒙疆棼局。亦難爬梳。最近則康藏事件。復告吃緊金沙江西岸之藏兵統帥己向川軍鄧旅長提出通牒要求川軍全部退出金沙江沿江各縣。鄧旅長電川告急。謂於必要時或將被迫退走甘孜其形勢之險惡。蓋可想見。</p>
<p>康藏自前歲構釁轉戰經年西康失地至十之六七維時藏番氣燄之盛殆無倫比。而川康軍以存亡所關。京復奮通死搏。卒能收復失地驅藏兵於金沙江西岸。而有十月八日停戰恊定之簽訂。恊定中要點。一雙方捐嫌修好。將歷年懸案聽候中央與達賴之解决。二雙方各止於金沙江兩岸。不能踰越一步。由是戰事乃告一段落。使主其事者。果能利用機會循此步驟進而與藏方謀澈底之討論。未嘗不足以解决懸案而遏止今後之亂萌顧一方有舉棋莫定之中央。一方有鷸蚌相持之川局。坐令達頼野心。隨川軍内訌之砲火而俱熾。則今回之事。謂爲川戰所促成。夫又孰得而非之</p>
<p>逹賴挾英方以自重。思抗衡於中央。處心積慮。己非一日。而猶不欲爲顯著之破裂。故一方嗾令藏番。在靑康一帶。作土地之侵略。一方派其代表。向中央政府。爲擁護之表示。旣授意部屬。從事於反對班禪之宣傳。復游說班禪。以進行平分藏局之商榷。其手腕之巧。譎固己咄咄逼人。而要兵事上。尤能深明攻交之術。去秋於侵康逼緊之際。對靑海則取和解之步調。迨康藏停戰恊定成立。遂有兩路進兵靑省之舉。此次爲欲重行圖康。則先於六月中簽定靑藏和約。其曼衍變詭又豈　頇昧度者所能測其端倪哉。</p>
<p>中央對於藏事。未嘗不認爲重要。祗以情勢遙隔。常呈頓挫之勢。去年西防會議中。曾决議請中央召開康藏和平會議。而此會議迄未聞有舉行之期也。</p>
<p>本年七月間。蒙藏會及參謀本部曾一度與達賴代表棍却仲尼商妥康藏和平辦法。而此辦法。迄未見諸施行也。蓋當局每於疑難之襲。來率未能有急遽之應付。因循坐誤於前。遲迥失措於後。遂令事態變化。陷於無法收拾。東北己事。可爲寒心。羊己亡矣。宜圖補牢。時至今日。倘猶不急起直追。以赴事機。則邊警之來。將無寗日。改絃更轍。是所望於今後之政府矣。</p>

<p>東京日外省爲對抗最近漸趨强化各國連鎖經濟、確立自國通商政策起見、準備設一通商審議會、以審議國難打開策、目下從關係大省之官吏及民間有力者中、巳選出委員六人、正式任命之後、即將於九月初旬開第一次會議、該會應恊議之事項、其根幹爲國别的貿易均衡對策、國内産業及對外條約之自主的統制、海外原料給源地之擴張比率、及市場之確保、日政府將以國别的貿易均衡策、附議於通商審議會、作爲新通商政策之一、蓋從來日本對於國别貿易、全取放任主義、試一觀去年之貿易額、對法貿易輸出入額均爲二千一百萬元、固能保持均衡、但對英貿易則輸出僅五千九百萬元、輸入則有七千八百萬元、計入超一千九百萬元、又對美貿易、輸出四萬四千五百萬元、輸入爲五萬零九百萬元、計入超六千四百萬元、對澳貿易輸出三千六百萬元、輸入一萬三千四百萬元、入超約一萬萬元、反之、對英領印度貿易、輸出爲一萬九千二百萬元、輸入爲一萬一千六百萬元、計出超七千六百萬元、對埃及貿易、輸出四千一百萬元、輸入一千九百萬元、計出超二千餘萬元、凡皆失貿易之均衡者、爲此、自去年起日本貿易轉爲出超之印度、突然發生排斥日貨之舉、而有此次西姆拉會議之事、日人以此爲鑑、在連鎖經濟尖銳化之今日、乃積極提倡貿易政策施行貿易統制、以謀國别貿易之均衡也、</p>
<p>自日本紡績業者决議不買印棉、以報復印度對日棉製品施行禁止的關稅之後、始向世界各地如土耳其尋求棉花之供給地、又如羊毛、從來日本對此之需要、幾全部仰給於澳洲、最近澳洲對日商品凖備重賦傾銷稅、日當局乃减少澳洲方面之羊毛購買額、而轉向南美南非及其他呼地尋求補充矣、因最近在南美中美及非洲方面新市塲之開拓、日本輸出貿易亦隨之有顯著發展、據傳最近巴西向日政府兜售棉花、烏拉圭兜售羊毛、皆足使日本貿易上有利關係更增親善、故日政府亟乘此時機確立新通商政策、以組織的方法努力開拓新市塲、並講求旣得市塲之確保策、</p>
<p>又東京訊、日本通商審議會、係因諮詢通商政策之根本方針而設、八月間己正式决定委員人選、將於九月初開首次會議、現因委員人選停頓、開議暫須延期、其延期理由、因外務確對該委員會、於官制制定上初有奏請諮詢樞院之意、後因鑒於考查部官制通過樞院不易、改以略式之省令發表、因此實質爲年權威者、推爲民間方通委員之日商工會議所會長鄉男及有力委員等辭退者續出、最初擬定官民合計四十名之委員、實際之出席者僅約二十五名、該會係常設委員會、性質重要、此後之進展如何、頗堪注意（世界社）</p>

<p>人壽保險制度的利益，在歐州及北美州各國的人民多能領悟了解，所以各人壽保險公司從被保人保費中積存而管理的巨大資金，能夠成爲民衆聖神的資財。牠不僅是被保人的生命源泉，同時也是整個國家的生命綫。</p>
<p>今日美國的人壽保險公司，爲什麽會在他們國内的經濟結構中，佔着重要的地位，因爲各人壽保險公司的資金，都是用來發展國内各種公用事業，建設事業，以及其他有利於民衆事業的投資。</p>
<p>近年以來，中國的人壽保險事業，巳有了急劇的進步。將來必定會成爲一種偉大的經營，所以近年來，有很多的人壽保險公司，己經先後組織設立。可是我們亦應該認識淸楚，因爲人壽保險公司的財産，就是民衆寳貴的資金；人壽保險的保費，不只是被保人的生活源泉，而是整個國家的生命綫。</p>
<p>因爲這個原因，被保人應該知道那一家保險公司的資財，是用來發展我們國家的經濟的，然後才去請求投保。現在中國境内，有不少的外國人壽保險公司，他們的總公司是設立在外國，在中國開了分公司做了不少的生意。他們在我國收到的保費，並不用爲發展我國的各種公益事業，統拿至他們總公司的所在地丨如加拿大，美國，英國去投資。我國從保費中流出的金錢，一時固然難得準確的數目，但是估計起來，每年不下千萬元之多，這眞是我國一種無、</p>
<p>形的大損失。别人利用人壽保險事業來發展國家的經濟建設，我國因爲人壽保險，反而每年要遭受千萬元的無形損失，實在是一件痛心的事實。有志保壽的同胞，當知有所警惕適從。</p>
<p>從國家的投資觀點說起來，中國現在巳經有了幾家管理良善，對被保人有利的華商人壽保險公司，尤其是華安合羣保壽公司，他是華商人壽保險界的領袖。他們一切經營計　都在人壽保險事業極有訓練的、員管理之下，可以說是國人最好的保壽機關。同時還有泰山·先施·永安·寗紹等幾家公司，也是華商組織，同爲國人保壽的良好機關。</p>
<p>在中國境内，也有一二家外國公司，是在上海及香港組織創立的，總公司設立在上海，如友邦人壽保險公司，四海保險公司，他們雖然是受英美等國法律的監督，但是他們是征收中國人的保費，還是用在中國投資。在實際方面，這兩家公司每年從斐律濱，英屬海峽殖民地，和其他各處分公司所收的保費，都拿到中國來投資。所以，這種公司是和上面所說的，拿中國保費到外國去投資的公司，不相同。目前當我國歡迎外資的時候，這種公司也　我們照顧的。總之，人壽保險是一個最好的投資方法，可是，我們應當用我們的保費，來發展中國的經濟建設。</p>

<p>人們對於儲蓄問題，莫不認爲重要，三年耕而有一年之積，九年耕而有三年之積，是古代儲蓄之方法，後來社會進化，有儲蓄銀行之設立，投資銀行者，於儲蓄母金之外，更獲相當之利子，此種儲蓄方法勝於古代遠矣，近來歐美各國保壽公司風起水湧，於是游資之集中，儲於保壽公司之數額，恒比儲蓄銀行而更鉅，此無他，蓋因銀行儲蓄，意義單純，而保壽儲蓄，能於權衡子母之外，復得一種實質的保障，故有識之士，注重銀行儲蓄，尤注重保壽儲蓄也，茲將保壽儲蓄與銀行儲蓄，列舉其優劣之點而比較之，審其意義，瞭若觀火矣。　　一銀行儲蓄，到期還本，保壽儲蓄，到期亦無不還本，銀行還本加息，保壽還本亦加派紅利，此其同也，惟儲户中途不幸死亡，在保壽公司，實踐其保險契約，無論繳費若干，均須依額賠償，若銀行儲蓄，不但無有賠償，且契約上有中途提還儲欵之種種限制，此其異也。</p>
<p>二保壽儲蓄，能將無定之欵額，成爲有定之欵額，因其人效之保壽單，常有一定價値，設如一萬元之保壽單，無論期限短長，付過一期保費，便有一萬元之價値，人生朝露，生死不能預知，持有若干元之保單，便有若干元之遺産，其儲蓄最終之目的，必有達到之一日，試問銀行儲蓄，能否如此，按年儲欵於銀行，中途遇險身故，或遭遇殘廢，不能完成其計畫者，固不知凡幾也。</p>
<p>三銀行儲蓄，無强迫儲蓄之要素，往往因應一時之需要，遂將蓄入之欵，遽行提用，其對於定期儲户，又非如保壽公司，於保户繳費到期預函通報，并於契約内，規定繳費通融之寛限，故銀行儲户，往往一時忘失，遂不能繼續其儲蓄之計畫，夫容易提取現欵，與容易忘付儲欵，皆非儲蓄最佳之方法，惟保壽儲蓄，有種種方法，確能使其存欵之目的貫澈始終也。</p>
<p>四一般意見，以爲儲蓄於銀行，其利息恒比保壽爲優厚，庸詎知利息之厚薄，至無標準，設如某甲四十歲購得二十年期一千元保壽單，每年繳納保費大約四十七元，倘一年内病故，收得賠償，與母金比率，足有二十餘倍之利益，倘繳費十年身故，其收得賠欵，與母金比率，亦約有二倍半之利益，若更費小欵，并保意外壽險，如遇着意外事故之時，則收益與繳費之比例，常有三四十倍之多，若在銀行儲蓄，固絶無此等之優厚利息也。</p>
<p>上述各點對於銀行儲蓄，與保壽儲蓄固足判别其優劣之所在，若就信用方面而論，銀行常有擠兌之風潮，而保壽公司因有一定之契約，非滿期不能還欵，非身故不能賠欵，絶無因擠兌以致倒閉之顧慮，觀於英美之保險公司可知矣。</p>
<h3 id="c107">人壽保險三百五十周年歷史槪述 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>一，起源</p>
<p>人壽保險巳有三百五十年的歷史，它的起源比較主要幾種的財産保險還來得遲。十二世紀中葉希臘羅馬的商人，因爲防備地中海海盜搶刦的損失起見，自己組織了一種自衛的團體，以謀彼此間的保障，這可算是保險歷史的第一頁。至現代的保險制度，是起源於英國。十六世紀時，從事海上貿易的商人，常常在倫敦一家小咖啡店裏，聚談生意經和各種事件。在這個地方，就發明了船舶及貨物保險的方法，以防海上的危險，這種船舶貨物保險，就是人類生命保險的濫觴，因爲當時航行的危險，各船主都主張對於喪失生命的海員的家屬，要給以相當賠償撫卹。西歷一五八三年六月十五日，倫敦皇家交易所中，有名威廉姆葛朋（ＷｉｌｌｅａｍＧｉｂｂｏｎ）的，簽署第一張人壽保險單。保單内載明承保人十六名，有效保期爲一年，保險金額爲三百八十三英鎊，並規定在承保期内，葛朋君如遭遇死亡，承保人應照保額賠償他的兒子。威廉姆葛朋氏己繳過了每百鎊八鎊的保費。　現代保險公司的保費比率，每百鎊不過一鎊而己，這是應當注意的。保單末段，并附有下列迷信的文字··「願上帝賜威廉姆葛朋以健康及長壽」，但不幸得很，他在翌年五月二十九日就去世了。以公歷每年十二月，每月三十一日計算，他是死在保險有效期内，應當賠償的。可是他的家屬把賠欵請求書提出後，承保人就根據保單　的月份，照每月四星期的　歷計算，不是以公歷的月份計算，說葛朋氏是死於舊歷十一個月巳滿之後，依照契約是没有賠償的。後來他的家屬訴之於法，經法庭判决家屬勝訴，而此破天荒第一次的人壽保險賠欵，繼如數付訖。從這張有歷史價値的保單之簽訂，到了今年，　路三百五十個年頭，這是很値得紀念的一件事。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c108">壽險業如何有利於中國國計民生郁賜 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>在未論及本題之前，作者應先聲明者，即以所著　就報章分期發表而不彙爲專書，致使讀者無前後參閱之機會，故有時乃不得不重申前言，以資明瞭。　　前次各篇所言，大都側重於壽險業之經濟功用及自經濟之立塲，說明其對於投保者之直接利益，惟是壽險業，决不能與普通商業等量齊觀，壽險業决非僅爲一謀利之企圖，其組織原視爲發自人羣互助合作之旨，其性質屬於「人道」之義者多，而謀利之意者少也。西歷一七五七年，英國第一家保壽公司於請領執照時，其呈文内有言曰，「陛下之子民，其衣食或賴辛俸之給，或恃經營之利，或用勞力所獲者，多欲互相團結，交互保險，庶保者在生之進益，得以身後遺傳，至其家屬而免凍餒之虞，一寥寥數語，於壽險業之本意，諄諄言之矣。</p>
<p>壽險以謀公利而互相合作之精神，現仍存在保壽公司者，實僅是項投資之專門保管庫而巳。壽險業逐步進展，此種精神，亦隨而發揚光大，於是在原有之經濟的利益外，更增加若干社會方面之利益，本篇所欲驾特述者，厥爲其中對於疾病之防範及治療，與夫人生生産時期之延長二端。</p>
<p>保壽公司，對於人生壽命之深切，而專門的研究，己確立遺傳氣候習慣職業環　及生活情形等於人生壽命之修短，有極重要之關係。此種研究的結果，使投保者之死亡率巳大爲减低，保壽公司於其研究所得，均盡情公佈之，故一班人，亦無不沾受其益。紐約萬國保壽公司佛蘭克爾君，生前嘗創辦一特别之部，名曰，「幸福」以灌輸衛生常識，及增進人體健康爲目的，所獲效果極佳。一般保壽公司，均巳公認確有設立此一專部之必要，其所費用於此者，以死亡率之降低，巳足補償之而有餘，蓋因此項工作之結果，人生壽命巳較前延長，賠欵無形减少。據云今日所生之嬰孩，其壽命長短，平均有五十八年之希望，而在一千八百年所生之嬰孩，其平均壽命之希望，僅三十五歲耳。　現今生命之延長，實己超出前者三分之二矣。</p>
<p>關於人生壽命常識之普及，其落後無過於中國者，投保人之體格，雖經醫士詳細檢騐，然死亡率之高，仍遠在他國之上，故中國保壽公司亟應設立「幸福」部，爲投保人實施衛生敎育，其需要尤切也。况中國人士現對衛生各事，亦頗問心，保壽公司苟能急起應此需求，領導之，提倡之，必將更受社會之擁戴與愛護，即爲其自身利益計，此舉亦不容緩。蓋壽險業之盛衰，與投保人壽命之長短，有極密切之關係。有云，「爲（幸福）之工作而費一元，由死亡率之减低可省二元，」可見保壽公司從事於衛生運動及佈傳，實與其自身有絶大之利益也，投保人僅限於身體健全，而經醫士之證明者，自爲必然之手續。但在他國投保人發生疾病時，保壽公司並備有醫士之服務，而在中國則付缺如。作者致身中國保壽事業二十七載，所見投保人因乏現代醫術之診治，致不應死而死者甚多。例如中國人之死於虎烈拉者，不知凡幾，　是故耳。虎烈拉昔在各國，亦爲一極危險之症，然自注射鹽針之術發明後，死於此症者，巳劇减。作者猶　此術，乃由柯斯博士傅至中國者。上海時疫醫院即爲博士所手創，活人無算，蓋自此術被採用後，死於虎烈拉者之百分比巳由八十五而降至十五矣。嘗憶作者曾一度參觀此醫院，其時適値虎烈拉盛行，來院求治者，室爲之滿，甚有臥於院前及門階上，以待施診者。作者目擊一患者，神色巳變，死神之臨在俄頃間，乃一經注射後，數點鐘内即痊　而出院矣，其生命之　救，實猶一奇跡之搬演也。</p>
<p>保壽公司之應努力衛生工作與宣傳，以增長投保人之壽命，蓋合乎壽險業之原理也。西方各國旣巳行之，而獲效矣，是中國尤應急起直追，乃爲毫無疑義之事。今試言紐約萬國保壽公司「幸福」部，自一九一一年成立後之工作情形，或可作華商保壽公司他山之一助乎，該部於衛生敎育之實施，自發行衛生刋物着手，其第一本小册名「肺病之戰」。繼之而刋行者，陸續不絶，均用淺顯之文字，說明如何衛生之法，如嬰孩看護，疾病預防，個人衛生，以及公共衛生等。今則活動範圍，更擴充至施診衛生展覽電影傳單等等，並與各公私衛生機關合作，竭力提倡之。二十一年來努力之結果，該公司投保人之死亡率，在一九三二年較之一九一一年，計低百分之三十三點四，換言之，因死亡逐年减低之結果，即在此一年中，投保人死者，巳减少近七萬人，故其受社會之愛戴，有自來矣。</p>
<p>壽險之制度與投保著之關係，旣如是密切，當可引起中國社會對彼之好感，而回溯作者各篇所言，保壽公司必努力維護投保者之壽命，與其努力，必得成功，此於中國人士反對保壽之迷信心理，亦可完全剷除之矣。</p>
<p>作者所著保壽論文之第一篇，其結論曰「人壽保險，乃人羣合作以增進人類幸福最良法則之一，使富力平民化，得平允之支配，而無赤貧之人。保壽公司所集之鉅資，乃人類各種優良之心理，如智慧節儉與犧牲，藉物質以所爲之表現。」今也日月推移，益證此說之不謬。所須增論者，壽險業除所保障之經濟的利益外，於普及衛生敎育增進人體健康，及延長人生生産時期，亦復供獻不巳也。健康乃快樂之泉源，惟健康之生命，始有生活之價値，有生活之價値，始有維持生命之必要。</p>

<p>次由中央代表上海市保安處處長楊嘯天氏致詞、楊氏略謂、今天中央派本人在此、參加五機命名典禮、覺得非常榮幸、不過本人有一點感想、這幾年來、救國的口號太多了、敎育救國·科學救國·馬達救國·眞是指不勝數、不過喊口號是無用的、要有事實表現出來、别的事祗喊口號、没有事實、祗有航空救國、有事實表現出來了、上海各界、對於航空事業、非常努力、物質精神、都有很大的帮助、前一次巳舉行上海市第一號命名典禮了、今又舉行第二次的飛機命名典禮、並且機數比以前加多、由此可見上海人士對於救國情緒之熱烈、愛護中央政府之忠誠、本人謹代表中央、向上海市民、謹誌謝意</p>

<p>次由國民政府代表航空署署長徐培根氏演說略謂、立國之要、首在國防、國而無防、便更多危險、若不幸發生民族戰爭、尤須靠政府與人民同力合作、否則民族將立陷於危亡、中國以前雖有無數民衆團體、但無顯著成效可言、現在上海民衆團體、居然購買了許多飛機、贈給政府、這是很顯著的成效、這般不可多得的成效、是値得記憶的、而且民衆的組織力量、也可從此看得出來、我們知道、一個民族、能在世界上存在與否、首先看他們自己能否出力保護自己的民族、民族或出財或出力、購買飛機、這是保護自己民族的表示、雖然、從海陸方面、也可以設法擴充、可是在今日空軍尤爲重要、要自衛的力量、非先擴充空軍不可、因爲空軍能與海陸軍聯絡作戰、上海市民、知道注意、防空運動、這實是我民族國家的大幸、本人代表政府深致感謝、</p>

<p>次由上海市商會主席王曉籟氏演說、略謂、上海市己有第一號飛機、舉行過命名典禮了、現又有五架飛機在此舉行命名禮、航空徵救隊、一共有十八架之多、將陸續舉行典禮、這從表面上看來、好似轟轟烈烈的舉動、但接實際、殊深漸愧、方纔俞秘書長說的很對、我們中國拿什麽能和外國比呢、飛機是從外國買來的、人才是有時須借重外國、幸虧有一個孫桐崗先生、在此替我們增光、（說至此、王亟從臺上牽引孫桐崗出、觀衆在臺下大鼓掌、）從前袁子才先生有兩句詩道「筆上墨痕刀上血、用來不錯是英雄、」我們希望中國有駕用飛機的人才、都如　　（轉入第五張十七版）</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>孫桐崗先生、將來來駕機去殺數人、不過有一點、最爲重要、我們希望切不可拿飛機去參加内戰、我們記得甲午之戰、曾用民脂民膏、向外國購買了一隻兵艦、呌作飛　的、不料後來並未殺敵人出風頭、祗不過有一次、用以捉康有爲、又有一次爲某某張炸壞了、民脂民膏、結果都犧牲於無用、這是很可痛心的、所以今後的飛機、要絶對的不參加内戰、庶不負今日萬衆來此參加命名典禮的盛意、</p>

<p>次由童子軍理事代表　行白氏演說、略謂、本人代表童子軍來說幾句話、因爲今天五機中有一童子軍相當成效、可惜日本有飛機、到處轟炸、而中國則無之、因此大家覺悟到空軍是國防中心、童子軍竭力募捐、結果、小有成功、也能購得飛機一架、但這是上海市民的力量、</p>

<p>不過借童子軍之手、以表現出來罷了、童子軍原是反對戰爭、主張和平的、不過和平是要建築在正義上、建築在平等上、非正義與不平等的和平、童子軍是反對的、我們要阻止帝國主義者進攻、以保持正義的平等的和平、所以要購買飛機、以資保衛、而除强暴、這是童子號機舉行命名禮時、兄弟代表他們說的話、</p>

<p>春秋特刋秋秋  瘦鶠　　人是喜新厭舊的動物，因爲過了幾個月的夏天，出汗出得太疲乏了，一見壁上的日歷，撕到八月將盡，九月初間的時候，便大聲疾呼地喊着··「秋來了」！「迎秋呀」！許多會寫文章的人，頓時加多了許多題材··你來一個「迎秋曲」，他來一個「秋之禮讚，」經他們的筆尖兒一煊染，秋似乎眞是一個可愛的季節了！　　其實，據經騐告訴我，據事實告訴我，秋實在不是一個可愛的東西，而是一個笑裏藏刀的奸人，一個迷人的粉骷髏！他初的時候，金風拂拂，玉露　　，天彷彿眞高了幾丈，氣彷佛也眞的爽了許多；可是經不起他把他那尖利襲人的寒風吹了幾天，痢疾，傷寒，種種的病魔都跟着來了。你如其能夠留心一些的話，你一定可以發現在秋天的街道上，出喪往往會比尋常多幾倍。還有，每一次大風大雨發生，以致於傷壞無數的農作物，也總是在秋天！就是說，秋天並不一定有瘟疫，一定有狂風暴雨，但是經不起他吹上幾天微風。下上幾晚小雨，也己夠把人們的精神摩損了「秋風秋雨愁殺人，」這話眞是一點不錯。當那微風吹動了樹梢，發出颯颯的細響··小雨打在屋瓦上，或是竹簾，淅淅瀝瀝地交奏着，你聽了這一套「秋之交響樂，」無論你是怎樣的鐵石心腸，也斷不能按捺住你的舊恨新愁，使他們不擁上你的心頭來。風和雨越吹得微，下得小，你的思潮便越是往悲觀方面淌去；如其你是一個屬於神經質的人，更不不有一個秋季是吹了十幾天的微風，下了十幾天的細雨，那結果一定會銷折掉你三年的壽命。　　「誰家秋院無風入，何處秋窗無雨聲？」多愁多病的林黛玉，伊對於秋天當然是格外的比别人認得淸楚一些，上面這兩句詩設是伊爲着秋而製的。不錯，把每一個季節的氣候比一下看；秋天確乎是風雨多的一個時期，而且它往往在起風下雨的時候，格外的把那張灰白色的天幕拉得下一些，差不多就要罩到你的頭頂上來了。而這樣的天色，這樣的風雨，好合成一服最靈效的「消神劑，」隨時可以把一個生龍活虎似的脚色，消磨到煴灶貓一般的地步。　　所以，依我說，秋雖不能拒，歡迎却實在不安，禮讚是更無須了！要歡迎，要禮讚，還是待春走來！小城市的新秋  耕飱　　大都會的新秋，馬路上多了若干减價的市招，學校門前，出出進進是忙功名的靑年田女；小城市的新秋，便另有一香氣象，大鎭上的土少爺，一枇杷的進城來讀書，城上的公子哥兒，自然也有他們的父兄，和他們籌測花綠綠的鈔票，準備子弟朝時代路上走；蘇北一部分，雖然今年遭着水災，揚屬八縣，秋收還算豐稔，佃户們都笑逐顏開，給主人送租榖，主人眼巴巴望到新稻登場，只暗喜没有受折扣的影響，不過榖價太賤，一石賣了兩元多錢，靠田吃飯的開門的其餘六事，依舊難於解决；男的婚娶，女的婚嫁，這筆臨時支去，簡直毫無着落，豐收豐收，給予有田地的還是苦痛而己！只有勞力們，三百文可換二升糙米，拉兩次南北城的車子，便辛苦到一家飽肚皮的代價；大腹賈準備屯積；商舖子襄充實貨品，渴望秋天做筆生意；牆邊屋角，孩子們拈着茅兒草，引誘蟋蟀出穴，緊握着鉛絲罩，不怕蟋蟀不作他們的盆中之囚，據說··「百脚」看門的是鐵中錚錚，能參與鬥鷄塲的血單；小城市的城河菱，味道，特别鮮美，菱塘裏的大森桶，不斷的划來划去；藕池裏的藕，也白歡得可愛；街頭巷尾，「城河裏的老菱啊，···一大藕啊，···」接連的送到耳邊；重陽迎神賽會，新秋己開始練習着笙　響笛，有專僱的樂師，給他們指導，輕柯一葉，在賽銀的月亮下蕩漾着，樂聲水聲，我們見了有飄飄羽化之概；東北的淪亡！匪共的猖獗！並不在話下，儼然充滿了太平景象！　　我們泰縣在新秋不幸極了，因爲改建大林橋，發生了崩塌死傷十數人的大慘劇！開縣志未有的哀聞！便利交通，原是建設的新政，這一大羣寃鬼，那天陳屍城隍廟，穿着一律的殮衣，截頭斷足！妻啼兒哭連看熱鬧的都没有一個不掩襟墮淚；工程上的疎忽，負責者的馬虎，大約是罪無可這吧？乖乖不得了，如果在享制政體下，　太爺恐怕要受丢印把子的處分，唯其是目前，也許不擔干系吧？秋夜  胡沉舟　　我脅着賴寂莫的心兒往馬路了踱去，慢慢地。　　天是這麽高高的，高高的；没有月亮，一條帶子樣的銀河當中央躺著，四周圍星星眨着眼。　　一陣風兒飛過來，帶着老遠的賣炒白菓的尖銳的呌喊··「燙手糯米熱白菓··香又香來糯又糯！白菓要吃鵝蛋大·一個銅板買三顆，若要，二個銅板買七顆」。跟賣夜報的尖銳的呌喊（那在現在聽了，越加悽慘似的）。飛過來；一片黄葉子打梧桐樹上落下來，落在我的前邊。恰巧，我的右脚兒踏過去、踏着它，我不由打了個寒噤，我的心兒碎了！　　陡的，一對登的靑年男女胳膊吊着胳膊，打我的身子邊蛇兒樣掠遇去。我聽得他們兩個兒的簡單的對話··那男的說道··「上大滬」去吧！」「呃，好冷！」「我們坐汽車去！」我望着那女的喬治紗裏的白的肉，赤裸裸的白的腿···顫動丨顫動丨顫動···我的耳朶子裏還藏着那嬌滴滴的聲音··「呃，好冷！」　　「哎呀」！聲音是怪細的，像蚊子呌一樣。天哪！我撞着些兒什麽？我撞着「鬼」了！不，是撞着了個人！在黑暗裏··我瞧明白一張破蓆子，一顆蓬蓬鬆鬆的腦袋，一支瘦得柴兒樣的手。「對不起！」我說道。朋友，這麽天氣露宿嗎？我想到一會兒露珠子打落下來，落下來，會落在他的身子上。我不敢再往下想了！　　馬路上，慢慢地靜下去，靜下夫；只牆脚跟的「叮嘶子」（我們寗波人呌是這麽「蟋蟀」的。）的呌喊越加大了。　　我帶着顆破碎的心兒向我的家鍍去，慢慢地秋的象徵  棲鳳樓主　　如火如茶苦悶欲絶的　，它知道人們在怨恨，在憎厭，所以送也不須送，很　相的己經悄悄地跑了，替代它行使職務的，却是蕭條的，嚴肅的秋，它旣不徵求羣衆的同意，更未慮及人們是否在歡迎，或反對，但它却毅然决然的，負着使命似的降臨到大地。　　秋啊，你抱着肅殺的態度，兇横的舉動，一意孤行的蠻幹！花樹遇了你，祗有調謝枯黄，人類逢着你，也是悲愁哀怨，一切的一切，也未嘗和你表同情，你不見春姐兒的時代嗎？和風麗日，百卉爭妍，人類融洩洩，多麽的好，你却對大衆非但没有好感；簡直惡感頗深！一時兒啼哭丨丨秋雨，一時兒狂號丨丨秋風，這些都是觸人愁緒，令人心碎！自無怪革命先烈瑾女土要念着··「秋風秋雨愁煞人」了，秋啊，你的行爲我己知曉，原來是象徵着殘暴横蠻的島國丨日本，和其他不顧公理的族類啊。　　現在雖巳秋天，除早夕凉爽，日中却依舊暑熱薫蒸，俗稱它「秋老虎」，老虎是一種兇惡噬人的野獸，也拿來咒咀着秋，它的不受羣衆的歡迎可知了。不遇我憶起兩句說；「　得秋後熱」和「待得秋來冬又到」，所以任它一意孤行，任它殘暴兇惡，恐怕都是暫時的，不是久長的吧！那勃勃的野心家，你們也何嘗不是如此，難道還不覺悟嗎？和合栗  曦兮　　當那秋之神大脚步跨到人間的時候，栗子照例的隨着一陣陣的秋風從天津的良鄉鎭吹到上海來了。半年來，爲了自己的事業，爲了苦戀着伊，每晚，當星爬上中天的時候，終是拖着這没有歸宿的影子，踏上這五光十色的柏油路經過這　水果店。看着金黄的鮮橘的落市，接着紅綠半參的桃子與蘋果的新興，秋風是己刮起柏油路上的微塵，誰料到粽色的栗子就此來臨。　　宛如蝴蝶向着花蕊投了留連的眼望着伊踏上歸途，自己茫然若失的回身拐着，胸膛裏咬緊了前天伊擲給我一個感謝的微笑，腦神經裏繹着一串玟瑰的思維什麽也不知道。幕然一陣白色的烟向我襲來，啊！栗子，是第一次喲！化了十幾銅元的代價買下一包，在這寂寞的路程上把它來消遣。當我剥着第一個栗子的時候，給我一個歡欣的發現，像一　野犬望着一根肉骨頭投着驚奇的眼光，啊！和合栗！和合栗！是第一次而又是第一個，這多麽的巧！不是嗎？我同伊和合的朕兆！　　和合栗的外形，是毫無異於尋常，剥開了栗殼，就可以發現中央隔着一層薄薄的皮。兩旁生着兩個同樣的栗子，記得在故鄉的時候，逢着這種栗子母親一定要我和人家分食的，可是現在呢？我雖然很希望和伊分食；但事實上那襄辦得到。我只當是上帝賜給我一個朕兆，讓我永遠的紀在心頭到了和合的時候也别把它忘掉！逰蹤所至秋的西子湖  黄克威是輕浮着紫丁香那麽淡香的哀愁的黄昏，西子湖在瘦弱的殘陽　，寂寞地，展開了一隻感傷的臉兒。　　靑色的天幕，　着那突兀的奇峯，落日在半山腰裡射出萬繼金蛇，玲　的山尖，披着一片透明的彩霞；楓樹　約地透着半顆赤紅的腦袋，幾隻烏鴉懶懶的飛過，一聲悠長的呌聲，深深地，打動了游子的心絃！　　古刹揚起淸脆的木魚聲，緩緩的，有節拍地和着小沙彌把弔水桶打下古井的聲浪，那麽撩有和愁情的調子呵！　　紅牆映着夕陽的反光，直射到西子湖上，嫠婦臉似的湖面，給塗紅了半片腮幇兒。　　，南國温凉的秋風，瑟瑟地，帶着半黄的落葉　　在飄着靑烟般的微壓的蘇堤上，凄凉地奔跑着，渺遠的蘇堤，渺遠的旅程哟！　　黄昏漸漸地偷走了，圓月亮巳打那塔尖上爬起來，獨個兒，雇了一隻小船去游湖。　　秋天的月夜多麽美麗喲！西子湖像銀盤一樣的托着一座湖心亭；四周環抱着的山峯，森林，廟宇，古塔，穿上了一件銀灰的蟬衣。一點點的燈光，閃着小眼珠子，蒙在霧裡似的的。如果我是個詩人，那末一定要低低地吟起詩來了，然而，我是個受傷的戰士，從荒漠裡帶着一顆破碎的心靈，悄悄地，逃到這秋的西湖來，洒一會痛苦的眼淚！　　孤單地，躺在船板上做着夢，悲哀，快樂，到夢裡去找尋吧！可是，什麽都和我别離，斷絶了！反正，什麽都没値得去回憶，去留戀！在月光朦朧的湖上，我只有一顆碎了的，寂寞的心，映在水上的拖長影子，還有，一個創傷的殘軀，還有呵！那是划船的老翁了。　　瞧着船翁的絲絲銀髮，我懷念着故鄉的母親了。也許伊正在婆娑的月光前縫着遊子身上衣吧？還是掛着眼淚在等待着流浪的遊子歸來呢？　　小星散下一把金錢，亮晶晶地，浮在湖上；四野喞喞的蟲聲，跟着水波一拗一拗地　過來，彷彿在嘆息，在哀訴，在啜泣！　　浮雲馱着月亮慢慢的斜到西方那兒去，船夫睜着惺忪的睡眼打着漿，不知那兒在敲着更鼓，時候巳是深夜了。　　付了船資上岸，幽靈似的，踏着月光歸去。别了，秋的西子湖喲！我永遠不會忘記的，你那嫠婦般感傷的臉兒，烟霧般悲哀的景色！可是，你會忘記嗎？在黄昏的堤上，在月夜的湖面，有一個流浪的靈魂，帶着一顆碎了的寂寞的心，一條拖長的影子，一個創傷的殘軀，孤獨地太息！苦悶流淚！新秋水畫  台生　　池邊口兒上，新從換衣室裏出來的一羣姑娘，紅的，藍的，黄的橡皮帽，深紅淺紫，淡藍的浴衣，夠得上攝影師Ｃｌｏｓｅｏｕｐ（特寫）顫抖的胸脯，彈性的，圓潤豐腴的大腿，兩條胳膊舉平了小小的鼻子，眼睛，瞧着水啦，那麽輕輕一　，嘩啦啦丨的水花，盜漾着淺藍銀光的水流，激得水花迸飛，滴溜溜地一條肉色淡藍的小銀魚，下了水啦！　　那麽小個子的，紅色帽子下，疊着淺淺笑渦嬌怯怯的姑娘儘是那麽笑着，瞧着水花，同伴們，一個一個都下了水啦，伊還是乾着身子，胳膊抱着　胳膊，用尖俏的喉口，探問着水的温度··　　「水襄？冷麽。麗麗？」　　「冷得狠啦！」那條淺藍的小銀魚，故意在水裏打着顫，又說··快下來吧怕什麽？來，來！您瞧；跳板上，那麽多的年靑的夥伴，還不夠您瞧麽？跳板的頂頭，紅的，藍的，黄的，浴衣，那麽一　地，像飛箭，像彎弓，滴溜溜地在水面上翻了個身，才　下了水，没有水花，没有聲音，眞好來事！　　　　跳台上，還是咱們的勇士，在最高的一層，一個，二個，三個，四個排齊了，由空中劃着健壯的電線，翻着身子，四條健壯的肉體，一齊飛下水面，四處浪花，淹没了四位健壯的勇士，但水面上，一忽兒，在這一頭，忽兒，在那一頭，攢出了四個滿沾着水珠的嘴臉！　　一個鬆髮的肉體豐滿的姑娘，臉上畫着挺紅的臙脂，由水池的石級上，划着下了水。小腿大腿，肚皮，胸脯，淹着了大奶奶，全身下了水啦，不氣悶麽？水珠子兒，沾上了姑娘的鬆髮，明麗的嘴臉。　　　　年靑的侍衛，靠過去，握着水裏的姑娘的手，說··　　「把頭埋在水裏，脚用勁的敲，我携着你，試試看！」　　一個選手似的長個子的夥伴，在敎導一個黑色的矮胖姑娘跳水，一次，二次，三次，乓丨的下了水！又水淋淋地由池邊口上那麽一　地划到長個子的身前。　　躺在板上，仰着，伏着，坐着的夥伴，由那溜着水流地槽子裏，滑下水，簡在像掉下水！啃水池，還是嘩啦啦丨重重的潑激的聲音，水池上，盪漾着迷人的女人和侍衛們的笑聲！兩對年靑的夥伴，居然搭起架子，爬在肩膊上，揪着對打，手拉着手，臂膀拉着臂膀，二個肩膀上的人，都由肩膀上乓丨的摔下水，大家都笑啦！連幾個靜靜地正躱在水池邊上，浸水的姑娘，

<p>自由談定命論精義  豈凡　　中國人大抵是定命論者。差不多的人都相信人間的窮通壽天，由他的八字註定。命相家且以推算八字所表出的運命爲生活之資，同時又闡明了富者所以富，窮人所以窮，達官顯宦之所以顯達的不得不然的必然之理。這理是無可懷疑决不會錯的，那是造物主在人間出生當時給他註定的運命，註定了他要餓死，像鄧通那麽家有銅山也不行，像梁武帝那麽貴錢天子也無法避免；註定了要飛黄騰達，像朱太祖曾賣在和尚廟裏做小沙彌也會做到皇帝。　　一個人境遇好了，是他命裏註定要好的；一個人做大官了，是他命裏註定要做到大官的；一個人窮了，由他命運不好；一個人被砍頭，也是他命中所遭，一切都早由造物主先安排定了的。富人的有財，福人的有福，苦人的吃苦，都是命中所定，理應如此而且非如此不成。所以朱門酒肉臭，路有餓死骨，也只能看做命運的不同，福人的福氣和苦人的苦惱的對比，而不能去在那中間尋出什麽關係來的，如想到什麽分配問題，要將未臭之酒肉給餓人吃，便有天註定的不許。　　近來盛倡救濟中國農村衰落現象，也不外天定的命運要農村的苦人再多吃些苦，因爲他們只有苦人的苦命，無論如何好不起來的。在天定一般的此種組織此種分配方法之下，即使産業振興了一百倍，苦人還是受苦，而且怕受的苦更慘。倘使想做吃的用的資料足夠之後即可以有飯大家吃，那麽不足夠時，也應得是大家少吃的，何至於孟軻先生要說··「庖有肥肉，廐有肥馬，途有餓莩，民有菜色一呢？　　精義很精，能享福的人到處可以享福，要吃苦的人到處只有吃苦。在定命論未破毁以前，一切的救濟振興改革都是徒然的，因爲這些辦法在那旣定的定命論之下，决不能反轉來使苦人享福，福人吃苦，而一定仍舊使福人益加享福，苦人更加吃苦的。這裏我悟到了革命的命字就是這定命的命字，好像革命己經成功，但看現在的大批命相家還有生意，覺得非常奇怪。「拿去我臉上的毛」  林語堂錢歌川先生在某日自由談上，說我批評基本英語，假造證據並謂我所引「卡羅與安娜」（ＣａｒｌａｎｄＡｎｎａ）書中某頁某頁之例皆不見書中（手下無原文，大意如此）我所根據頁數是奥克登原著ＡＢａｓｉｃＶｏｃｃａｂｕｌａｒｙ所引，頁數有錯，當由奥克登負責。諒是板本不同。茲再就原書卡羅與安娜」的一九三○年版本（Ｌ·Ｗ·Ｌｏｃｋｈａｒｔ所譯，倫敦、Ｋｅｇａｎｐａｕｌ出版，有奥克登序言），指明頁數，以證明吾言不虚，並附上幾條奇異的新發現。錢先生說無，我說有。將來無法解决時，只好請黎烈文先生請一頓飯，了結此層公案。　　我原文（論語二十二期）指出頁數之例，共五條，都在此地。　　（一）關於留聲機丨一一個磨光黑色的圓圈，中　一隻狗在一個喇叭之前。　ａｐｏｌｉｓｈｅｄｂｌａｃｋｃｉｒｃｌｅｗｉｔｂａｐｉｃｆｕｒｅｋｆａｃｏｇｉｎｆｒｏｎｏｆａｈｏｒｎｗａｓｐｌａｙｉｎｇａｐｉｅｃｅｏｆｍｉｌｉｔａｒｙｍｕｓｉｃ（第五十一頁第八至十行）。　　（二）關於鬍鬚丨不但「鬍」字没有，連「剃」字也没有，所以有一段說卡羅在獄中時「每星期六拿去他而上之毛」ＣａｒｌｂａｄｔａｋｅｎｔｈｅｂａｉｒｏｆｆｂｉｓｆａｃｅｅｖｅｒｙＳａｔｕｒｄａｙ（第二十八頁末行）「面上之毛」又見第十八頁第七行（面上之毛很長而没人管）；第五十八頁十一行（舖主上唇上曾有過黑毛）；第二十九頁第二至四行（倘使你從前臉上没毛，過了這些年有了毛去見她·····）　　（三）關於奶頭丨「她非常的年靑的奶袋，白而細，並有小的藍天色的記號（恕我直譯一次，因原文本來生硬也；）「記號當係指」靑筋）　　ｂｅｒｍｉｌｋｖｅｓｌｅｓｗｂｉｃｈｗｅｒｅｓｕｔｐｒｉｓｉｎｇｌｙｙｏｕｎｇｗｅｒｅｗｈｉＴｅａｎｄｓｍａｌｌａｎｄｈａｄａｍｅｌｌｓｋｙｂｌｕｅｍｓｒｋｉｎｇｓ（第七十二頁倒數第二至第四行）。　　又另一段，原書是奶頭，基本英文不作「奶袋「而作「身體上部」丨我常問自己，「爲什麽她身體上部是這樣白，而其餘部分及她的腿却是更深的顏色？」ＴｈｅｑｕＥｓｔｉｏｎＩｆｒｅｑｕｅｎｔｌｙｐｕｔｔｏｍｙｓｅｉｆｉｓＷｈｙｉｓｔｈａｔｔｈｅｕｐｐｅｒｐａｒｔｏｆｈｅｒｂｏｄｙｉｓｓｏｗｈｉｔｅａｎｄｔｈｅｒｅｓｔｏｆｈｅｒｂｏｄｙａｎｄｈｅｒｉｅｇｓａｓｏｍｕｅｈｄｅｅｐｅｒｃｏｌｏｕｒ　（第十八頁。十二至十六行）。　　（四）關於幻想丨Ｔｈｅｍｏｔｔｂｕｔｎｉｎｇｔｂｏｕｇｈｔｐｉｃｌｕｒｅ第三十一頁。關於此段文字，見下。　　（五）關於葱丨「令眼出水之白根」丨此條係奥克登自己說明曲達方法之例（見氏所著ＡＢａｓｌｃＶａｃａｂｕｌａｒｙ第八十三頁）。　　此外，我又發見「卡羅與安娜」書中不可解及可笑的句子五句。假定這些句不是「基本英文」而是發見於學生作文卷中，敎員必毫不客氣的批爲不通。　　（甲）「他的肚子上的重物不去」。原文及上下句如下··　　ＲｉｃｈａｒｄｈａｄｍａｄｅａｎｉｃｔｕｒｅｏｆｔｈｅｄｅｓｉｇｎｆｏｒｈｉｍＴｈｅｗｅｉｇｈｔｏｆｂｉｓｓｔｃｍａｃｈｄｉｄｎｏｔｇｏＨｅｂａｄａｎｉｍｐｕｌｓｅｔｏｇｏＳｎｄｃｏｍｅｂａｃｋｌｓｉｅｒ（第三十頁，第十至十四行）。初看百思不得其解，後來發見上段一句說，卡羅有某種「念頭像他肚子上之一種重物。」（同頁第二行）。　　（乙）「她身體的重被拉下」丨上文是安娜上舖去買肉，錢又不夠，頗費思量，如何可以買夠給二人吃，接着是··（生硬悉依原文）「思想是需要的。思想取感情而代之。她身體的重被拉下。她的頭上來，淸楚而自由」（揣其情勢，似是說她身微俯，然後似有所得，又昂首起來）。　　ＴｂｏｕｇｂｔｗａｓｎｅｃｅｓｓａｒｙＦｅｅｌｉｎｇｇａｖｅｐｌａｃｅｔｏｔｈｏｕｇｈｔＴｈｅｗｅｉｇｈｔｏｆｈｅｒｂｏｄｙｗａｓｐｕｌｌｅｄｄｏｗｎＨｅｒｈｅａｄｃａｍｅｕｐｃｌｅａｒａｎｄｆｒｅｅ（第五十五頁第十至十四行）　　（丙）拿嘴唇丨「他們兩人相擁抱了，不動。後來他舉目，看見她的嘴唇開着等着他，而就給拿了再拿，一句話不說。「Ａｎｄｗｂｅｎｌｉｆｔｉｎｇｈｉｓｅｙｅｓｈｅｓａｗｂｅｒｌｉｐｓｏｐｅｎｗａｉｔｉｎｇｆｏｒｈｉｍａｎｄｔｏｏｋｔｈｅｍｓｇａｉｎｎｏｗｏｒｄｗａｓｓａｉｄ（第四十八頁第十六至十九行）。按「拿嘴唇」，似乎是「吻」，但八百五十字中有Ｋｉｓｓ何以不用？是否不許Ｋｉｓｓ作動詞加過去之ｅｐ用不得而知。　　（丁）「愉悅在他的眼中」這句有點像洋人的中國話。Ｈｉｓｐｌｅａｓｕｒｅｗａｓｉｎｈｉｓｅｙｅｓ（第二十二頁第一行）　　（戊）「有時對於她的記憶完全丢了」丨按此爲曲達之一例。因八百五十字中無「忘」（ｆｏｒｇｅｔ）字故有此曲達方法。　　Ｓｏｍｅｔｉｍｅｓｔｂｅｍｅｍｏｒｙｏｆｈｅｒｇｏｅｓｃｏｍｐｌｅｔｅｌｙ第十九頁第二至三行）。　　總而言之，我痛恨這種文字，無論是中文是西文。請以以下一段爲代表。　　　「他了悟了，最熱烈的思想影子也不及於一個能，呼吸，靈動，活着的人，那人臉上由於血起的變化與活的心有關連，而且自身就是活之一部。一個人的形體有單獨的存在，身體的動作在空間經過，剪過去。」　ａｎｄｉｔｂｅｃａｍｅｃｌｅａｒｔｏｈｉｍｔｈａｔｔｈｅｍｏｓｔｂｕｒｎｉｎｇｔｎｏｕｇｎｔｐｉｃｔｕｒｅｉｓｎｏｔｅｑｕａｌｔｏａｂｒｅａｔｈｉｎｇｍｏｖｉｎｇｌｉｖｉｎｇｈｕｍａｒｌｂｅｉｎｇｔｈｅｃｈａｎｇｅｓｏｆｗｈｏｓｅｆａｃｅｔｈｒｏｕｇｈｔｈｅｂｌｏｏｄｈａｖｅａｃｏｎｎｅｃｔｌｏｎｗｉｔｈｔｈｅｌｉｖｉｎｇｈｅａｒｔａｎｄａｒｅｔｈｅｍｓｅｌｖｅｓａｐａｒｔｏｆｌｉｖｉｎｇＴｈｅｆｏｒｍｏｆａｌｈｕｍａｎｂｅｉｎｇｈａｓｓｅｐａｒａｒｅｅｘｉａｓｔｅｎｃｅｉｔｓｍｏｔｌｏｌｌｓｇｏｔｈｒｏｕｇｈｓｐａｃｅｃｕｔｔｉｎｇｔｈｃｉｒｗｓｙ涩（第三十頁尾段）　巳而己而，今之行文者殆而。不但臉上毛可以拿，連嘴唇也可以拿。在以十八個動詞表示世上人間一切動作之基本英文中，「拿字之用亦云弘矣。救命圈  彭家煌遺著　　兩人在村莊裏露宿，那個有一格蘭姆運氣的人，不管三七念一，躺在大路中心；那個有一噸智慧的人，怕車馬壓死，便躺在大路旁邊。夜深，馬車來了。兩匹馬見着路中心的黑影，嚇得向路旁一跳，反把有一噸智慧的人壓死。羅馬尼亞的諺語說道··　　「這一格蘭姆的運氣，勝過一車的智慧。」　。某日報上載着一件「趣事」，一堪發一嚎」··嘉興許明富，失業巳久，窮極無聊，沿浦江往來徘徊，在碼頭敲破路旁所設玻璃櫃，取出救命圈，被拘送法院，法院以其「誤解」字義，觸犯刑章，處拘役十天，緩刑二年，判畢，揮之而去。····　　天下事，每每死中得活，像駝鳥一樣不抵抗，把頭插在沙裏避死，總是逃不了死。人還在岸上「活」着，就拿着落水用的救命圈，這顯然和救命圈開玩笑。救命圈是不管岸上人的死活的，你如想在水裏死，牠纔呌你死不成。　　許明富倘眞不怕死，跳進黄浦江，也許救命圈套在他頸上，能夠得救。倘是法院嚴辦，眞處拘役十天，不緩刑二年，至少這十天也能得救。「判畢，揮之而去，」前途茫茫，不死不活，到那裏去呢？　　人們還是憑一格蘭姆運氣，躺在大路中心吧！彭家煌挽歌  何如　　他對得起貧苦的朋友，　　他是同樣餓過肚皮的人。　　他對得起勇敢的戰士，　　他是同樣坐過監獄的人。　　他留下了許多可讀的文字，　　却不曾自誇爲天才。　　他參加了許多人間的工作，　　却不曾被稱爲人才。　　他賣過了許多精神的勞力，　　却不曾出賣自己的人格。　　他是個餓過肚皮的人，　　他可告别貧苦的朋友。　　他是個坐過監獄的人，　　他可告别勇敢的戰士。女人（十七）  沈從文　　女的笑着說··　　「不愛旣不必用口說我就明白，愛也可以無需乎用口說。」　　男的說··　　「還生我的氣嗎？」　　女的說··　　「生你什麽氣？生氣有什麽用處？」　　兩人後來在煤油燈下吃了晚飯。飯吃過後，女的便照醫生所囑咐的把兩種藥水混合到一個小瓶子裏，輕輕的搖了一會，再倒出到白磁杯子裏去。　　服過了藥，男的躺在床上，女的便坐在床邊，同他來談話一切過去事情。兩人談到過去在海邊分手那點誤會時，男的向女的說··　　「····你不是說過讓我另外給你一個機會，證明你是個什麽樣的人嗎？我問你，究竟是什麽樣的機會？」　　女的不說什麽，站起了一下，又重復坐下去，把臉貼到男的臉邊去。男的只覺得香氣醉人，似乎平時從不聞過這種香味。　　第二天早上約莫八點鐘，男的醒來時，房中不見女人，枕頭邊有個小小信封，一個外面并不署名，一拈到手中却知道有信件在襄面的白色封套。撕去了那個信封的紙皮，襄面果然有一張寫了字的白紙，信上寫着··　　我不知爲什麽，總覺得走了較好。爲了我的快樂，爲了不委屈我自己的感情，我就走了。莫想起一切過去有所痛苦，過去旣成爲過去，也値不得把感情放在那上面去受拆磨。你本來就不明白我的。我所希望的，幾年來爲這點願心經騐一切痛苦，也只是要你明白我。現在你旣然己明白我，而且愛了我，爲了把我們生命解釋得更美一些，我走了，當然比我同你住下去較好的。　　你的藥在桌上業己配好，到時照醫生說的方法好好吃完，吃後仍然安靜的睡覺。學做個男子，學做個你自己平時以爲是男子的模樣，不必大驚小怪，不必讓旅館中知道什麽。希望你能照往常一樣，不必担心我的事情。我并不是爲了增加你的想念而走的。我只覺得我們事情業己有了一個著落，我應當走，我就走了。　　天保佑你如蕤留　　把信看完後，他趕忙撳床邊電鈴，聽差來了，他手中還揑着那個信，躺在床上，本想詢問那聽差的，同房女人什麽時候下的山，但一看到聽差，却不作聲，只把頭示意，要他仍然出去。聽差拉上了門出去後，他伸手去攫取那個藥瓶，藥瓶中的白汁，被振蕩時便發着小小泡沫。　　他望着這些泡沫在振蕩靜止以後就消滅了，便繼續搖着。他愛她，且覺得眞愛了她。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e6">Yu Xuezhong Leaves Beiping for Tianjin Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Yin Tong visited He this morning to request instructions regarding the suppression of bandits in the war zone. He also sent representatives to Yuguan this morning, who will then proceed to Changchun to discuss with the Japanese Kwantung Army methods for suppressing banditry in the war zone. They are expected to return to Beiping in about ten days and then proceed according to the agreed-upon methods. Of the seventy-plus passes along the Great Wall, only five major passes—Yuguan, Jieling, Lengkou, Xifengkou, and Gubei—are garrisoned by Japanese troops. Bandits frequently emerge from the various small passes. In order to prevent banditry, we have decided to first transfer police from the war zone to station at various small passes. The Negotiating Committee will then negotiate with the Japanese side to recover the major passes. The issue of returning the seat of Linyu County to Yuguan is in progress. It will take some time for the puppet organizations within Yuguan City to close down. Once they are closed down and moved out of Yuguan City, the county government will be moved back. Liu Shisun will go to Yuguan within the next few days to negotiate. There should be no problems with the takeover of Yuguan City. However, the Japanese army is still in a state of wartime preparedness, and its organizations are also temporary military organizations, so it is not easy to handle all matters. We urgently hope that they will return to a peacetime state so that all matters can be easily negotiated and public confidence can be restored. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Yu Xuezhong visited He Yingqin this morning for an hour-long discussion. He then attended the war zone relief meeting. He returned to Tianjin at 1:30 PM. At the East Station, he said that Yin Tong has sent representatives to Changchun to discuss the suppression of bandits in Eastern Hebei. The dispatch of troops for suppression will be decided after the negotiations are completed. The reorganization of Shi Yousan's troops is no longer an issue. Japanese troops are still stationed at the major passes along the Great Wall, and the takeover is still subject to negotiation. The regulations for administrative inspectors in the war zone have been submitted to Nanjing but have not yet been approved. The emergency relief group of the Relief Committee held a meeting this morning, but it failed to form a quorum. Some people advocate for handling emergency relief in Chahar Province at the same time. I believe that the disaster situation in Hebei is more severe than in Chahar, so Hebei should be prioritized over Chahar. My trip to Beiping was to meet with He for discussions. I am returning to Tianjin in haste because I will be hosting a banquet for the Swedish Prince tonight. I will come to Beiping again in a day or two to continue discussions with various parties.

<h3 id="e8">The Rapid Escalation of the Situation in Kham and Tibet <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The nation's power is declining. Border affairs are becoming increasingly urgent. The Northeast issue is beyond repair. The predicament in Mongolia and Xinjiang is also difficult to resolve. Recently, the Kham-Tibet situation has become tense again. The Tibetan military commander on the west bank of the Jinsha River has issued an ultimatum to Deng's Sichuan army brigade, demanding the complete withdrawal of Sichuan troops from all counties along the Jinsha River. Commander Deng telegraphed Sichuan for help, stating that he may be forced to retreat to Garze if necessary. The perilousness of the situation is imaginable.</p>
<p>Since the conflict erupted in Kham and Tibet the year before last, with fighting lasting for years, Western Sichuan lost six or seven out of ten of its territories. The arrogance of the Tibetan bandits was unparalleled at the time. The Sichuan and Kham armies fought desperately for their survival. They were finally able to recover the lost territories and drive the Tibetan troops back to the west bank of the Jinsha River, leading to the signing of the ceasefire agreement on October 8. The key points of the agreement were: 1. Both sides would renounce their grievances and reconcile, leaving the pending issues to be resolved by the central government and the Dalai Lama. 2. Both sides would be restricted to the banks of the Jinsha River and could not cross over. Thus, the war came to an end. If those in charge had been able to seize the opportunity and follow these steps to engage in thorough discussions with the Tibetan side, it would not have been impossible to resolve the pending issues and prevent future unrest. However, on one side was a hesitant central government, and on the other side was the Sichuan situation, where the snipe and clam grappled with each other, allowing the Dalai Lama's ambitions to grow along with the gunfire of the Sichuan army's internal strife. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that this incident was caused by the Sichuan war.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama relies on the British for support and seeks to counter the central government. His scheming has been going on for more than a day. However, he still does not want a blatant break. Therefore, on the one hand, he instigates Tibetan bandits to invade territory in Qinghai and Kham. On the other hand, he sends his representatives to the central government to express his support. He has instructed his subordinates to engage in propaganda against the Panchen Lama and has also persuaded the Panchen Lama to negotiate a division of the Tibetan situation. His skill and cunning are already daunting. In military affairs, he is particularly adept at the art of combining attack and diplomacy. Last autumn, when he was pressing hard on Kham, he adopted a conciliatory approach towards Qinghai. After the Kham-Tibet ceasefire agreement was established, he launched a two-pronged attack on Qinghai Province. His shifting tactics and trickery are beyond the comprehension of those who are ignorant and obtuse.</p>
<p>The central government has always recognized the importance of Tibetan affairs. However, due to the geographical distance, progress has often been slow and hampered. At last year's Western Defense Conference, it was resolved to request the central government to convene a Kham-Tibet peace conference. However, there has been no news of this conference being held.</p>
<p>In July of this year, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the General Staff Headquarters once reached an agreement with the Dalai Lama's representative, Gunquet Zhongni, on a Kham-Tibet peace plan. However, this plan has not been implemented. In general, the authorities have often failed to respond quickly to crises. Delay and inaction have led to mistakes in the past, and hesitation and confusion have led to failures in the aftermath. This has led to changes in the situation and made it impossible to salvage. The Northeast incident should serve as a cautionary tale. The sheep has already been lost; it is time to mend the fold. If we do not act quickly and catch up with the situation, the border will never be peaceful. Changing course is what we hope for from the government in the future.</p>

<p>Stampar is Scheduled to Depart Next Month</p>
<p>To Assist in China's Rural Construction</p>
<p>Sugimura Departs Today for a Tour of China to Meet with Rajchman</p>
<p>Geneva The Council of the League of Nations decided on May 19, 1931, to engage in technical cooperation with the National Economic Council of China to assist China in its construction efforts. In July of this year, when Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen was in Europe, the League of Nations held a China Cooperation Committee meeting in Paris. In addition to representatives from eight countries—Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Norway, Czechoslovakia, and China—the United States also participated. The meeting nominated Dr. Ludwik Rajchman, Director of the Health Section of the League of Nations, as the technical liaison officer between the League of Nations and China. Recently, the League of Nations also appointed Dr. Andrija Štampar of Yugoslavia as a health commissioner, responsible for rural administration and construction issues in the technical cooperation plan. After the Chinese flood in 1931, Dr. Štampar stayed in China for several months to handle post-flood health affairs. For the past three years, he has been a member of the Health Committee of the League of Nations. Prior to this, he served as the Director of the Yugoslavian Health Bureau, managing rural health affairs, and was known for his diligence. He established as many as 600 health stations in Yugoslavia. The League of Nations sent him to China to implement the plan to assist China in rural construction. In addition, two other people have also been sent to China by the League of Nations: Dr. Dragoni, former Secretary-General of the International Institute of Agriculture in Rome, and Mr. Berni, former Chairman of the Italian Silk Producers Association. Their mission is to assist China in rural construction. Dr. Štampar is scheduled to depart for China in October. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo Minister Koki Sugimura is scheduled to depart from Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM on the 10th, heading west via Korea to Manchuria, then from North China via Shanghai to Guangdong. He is scheduled to return to Japan at the end of October. On the surface, this is said to be a private trip to gain a fresh understanding of the situation in the Far East after the Manchurian Incident. In particular, he hopes to meet with Dr. Rajchman, who has been sent by the League of Nations to provide technical assistance to China, in Shanghai and is tasked with dispelling misunderstandings about Japan. Furthermore, Ambassador Naotake Sato has succeeded Ambassador Nagaoka, who will return to Japan on the 17th, as the Japanese Ambassador to France, while Minister Sugimura will succeed Ambassador Sato as the Ambassador to Belgium.

<p>Tokyo The Japanese Foreign Ministry, believing that the economic policies adopted by various countries have gradually worsened Japan's economic relations with them, has decided to abandon passive countermeasures and fundamentally change its trade policy to trade protectionism. It has telegraphed Ambassadors Eiji Fujii in the United States and Yasuhiro Matsudaira in England, as well as Minister Saitō in the Netherlands, warning the three countries and pointing out the harm of the group economy implemented by the three governments through their colonies to world trade. If they do not change their policies, Japan will adopt necessary measures from a protectionist trade perspective. (9th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo In order to counter the increasingly strengthened chained economies of various countries and establish its own trade policy, the Japanese Foreign Ministry is preparing to establish a Trade Council to review measures to overcome national difficulties. Currently, six members have been selected from officials of related ministries and influential figures in the private sector. After their official appointment, the first meeting will be held in early September. The matters to be discussed by the council are fundamentally the countermeasures for trade balance with other countries, the autonomous control of domestic industries and foreign treaties, the expansion ratio of overseas raw material supply sources, and the securing of markets. The Japanese government will attach the policy of trade balance with other countries to the Trade Council as one of the new trade policies. In the past, Japan has adopted a laissez-faire policy for trade with other countries. Looking at last year's trade volume, the import and export volume of trade with France was 21 million yuan each, which was able to maintain a balance. However, in trade with England, exports were only 59 million yuan, while imports were 78 million yuan, resulting in a deficit of 19 million yuan. In trade with the United States, exports were 44.5 million yuan and imports were 50.9 million yuan, resulting in a deficit of 6.4 million yuan. In trade with Australia, exports were 36 million yuan and imports were 134 million yuan, resulting in a deficit of about 100 million yuan. Conversely, in trade with British India, exports were 19.2 million yuan and imports were 11.6 million yuan, resulting in a surplus of 7.6 million yuan. In trade with Egypt, exports were 41 million yuan and imports were 19 million yuan, resulting in a surplus of over 20 million yuan. All of these are cases of trade imbalance. For this reason, since last year, India, whose trade with Japan has turned into a surplus, suddenly took measures to exclude Japanese goods, leading to the recent Simla Conference. Taking this as a lesson, Japan is actively promoting trade control in today's intensified chained economy to seek trade balance with other countries.</p>
<p>After Japanese textile manufacturers decided not to buy Indian cotton in retaliation for India's imposition of prohibitive tariffs on Japanese cotton products, they began to seek cotton supply sources in various parts of the world, such as Turkey. As for wool, Japan has traditionally relied almost entirely on Australia for its needs. Recently, Australia is preparing to impose dumping duties on Japanese goods. The Japanese authorities have reduced the amount of wool purchased from Australia and are turning to South America, South Africa, and other places to find replacements. Due to the recent opening up of new markets in South America, Central America, and Africa, Japan's export trade has also seen significant development. It is said that recently Brazil offered to sell cotton to the Japanese government, and Uruguay offered to sell wool, which would further enhance favorable relations in Japan's trade. Therefore, the Japanese government is seizing this opportunity to establish a new trade policy, striving to open up new markets in an organized way, and seeking measures to secure existing markets.</p>
<p>Also, according to Tokyo sources, the Japanese Trade Council was established to consult on the fundamental guidelines of trade policy. In August, the list of members was officially decided, and the first meeting was scheduled to be held in early September. Now, due to the stagnation in the selection of members, the opening of the meeting must be postponed. The reason for the postponement is that the Foreign Ministry initially intended to consult the Privy Council on the establishment of the council's official system, but later, considering that it would be difficult for the Privy Council to pass the official system of the Examination Department, it changed to publishing it in the form of a simplified ministerial order. As a result, those who were essentially powerful figures, such as the Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kenji Go, and other influential members, have resigned one after another. Initially, it was planned to have a total of 40 members from the government and the private sector, but the actual number of attendees is only about 25. This council is a permanent committee with important nature. How will it progress in the future? It's worth noting. (World Press)</p>

<p>Tokyo It is reported that the National Government has decided to build a large air force with the assistance of the United States at the Lushan Conference. This matter has aroused agitation in various sectors in Japan. The Japanese Army's views on this are as follows: Some say that given China's current state, even if it equips itself with aircraft, it is not to be feared. However, according to reports, the United States will send a large number of instructors to China for serious training, so it cannot be underestimated. If it builds an air force and increases the number of aircraft, then an air force power that Japan should fear will be in its neighbor. However, whether it can be realized cannot be immediately determined. It is necessary to pay attention to its trend. The Navy's opinion is as follows: If China receives assistance from other countries to build an air force and open up air routes, there is a risk that its national policy will be controlled by that country. In particular, excluding Japan is regrettable for both China and Japan. The Navy is only paying attention to its trend. (9th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Shao Yuanchong Reports at the Central Commemoration Meeting</p>
<p>Nanjing The Central Government held a commemoration meeting for the Premier's First Uprising at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Those present included Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Leng Chuanxian, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Zhang Weicun, Miao Peicheng, Wang Qi, and others, as well as all staff members and representatives from various agencies, totaling over 700 people. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Shao Yuanchong gave a report, first recounting the events of the Premier's first Guangzhou revolution, as well as the difficulties at the time, the weakness of the revolutionary forces, and the separate opinions of Yang Quyun within the revolutionary party, which led to the failure. He then said that the history of the Premier's revolution had a great impact on the revolutionaries, namely: (1) The first revolution not only took place in Guangzhou but also awakened the attention of the people of the whole country, the sympathy of the people of the world for our country's revolution, and the shock of the Qing government, thus making the revolutionary cause progress day by day. (2) The lesson given to us by the first revolution is that although there is a need for revolution, we must inform the pioneers to take responsibility for the revolution, regardless of success or failure, and fight resolutely to break through all difficult environments. (3) All revolutionary movements, as well as political movements, must have unchanging plans, the unity of cadres, and the understanding of the people in order to achieve success. Such is the lesson given to us by the history of the first revolution. We should follow this lesson in the future to carry out the work of national rejuvenation and save the country from danger.

<p>Nanjing The Nanjing City Party Headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life at 9:00 AM on the 9th to hold the 38th-anniversary commemoration meeting of the Premier's First Uprising. Those present included representatives from various central government departments, Nanjing City agencies, organizations, schools, and lower-level party headquarters, totaling over 300 people. Yuan Yeqiu, Chairman of the City Executive Committee, reported on the process of the Premier's first uprising and the revolutionary upsurge at that time. Unfortunately, although the event failed, it ultimately revived the dead hearts and saved the country's dying pulse, resulting in the success of the Xinhai Revolution. Today, the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the violent Japanese have occupied our four northeastern provinces, and the utterly inhuman communist bandits are rampant everywhere. Today, in commemorating the Premier's first uprising, we must unite as a nation, be of one heart and one mind, assist the government, and suppress the Red bandits in order to eliminate internal worries. Then, we can use the strength of the whole country to resist the violent enemy and recover the lost territories in the Northeast, so as not to lose the meaning of the commemoration meeting.

<p>The Disturbances on the Yunnan Border Will Soon Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Nanjing According to Gesang Zeren, a party worker in Xikang, regarding the Tibetan army's invasion of Zhongdian and southward encroachment on the Yunnan border, Dalai's inconsistency has long been recognized by the Chinese people. In reality, he is merely being instigated and used by a third party. The military conflict between Kham and Tibet continues with the two armies confronting each other across the Jinsha River. Regarding the recent disturbances on the Yunnan border, Long Yun telegraphed Nanjing stating that they are disturbances caused by the local people at the junction of Kham, Tibet, and Yunnan, which have spread to the Yunnan border. They will soon be eliminated, and there should be no major problems. Such disturbances occurred when I was in Yunnan two years ago and were immediately dispersed after being informed. This time, Long has dispatched troops to suppress them in order to fundamentally stabilize the area. The General Staff Headquarters has also tasked the specialized members of the Border Affairs Group with studying fundamental solutions to the frequent disturbances by the local people in the border area, and they are currently discussing them. Shi Qingyang said that this commission has not received any official telegrams regarding the Tibetan army's demand for the withdrawal of Xikang troops from Zhuwo, Dege, and Zhanhua counties. It has only received a telegram from Liu Wenhui forwarded by the Central Government. The commission has instructed the Dalai's office in Nanjing to inquire about the truth from Tibet. After the truth is ascertained, it will formulate measures and submit them to the Central Government for approval. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>To Provide the US with Air Base Construction Rights</p>
<p>Arousing the Attention of Japanese Military Authorities</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Japanese newspaper "Harbin Times" carried a piece of news stating that Soviet Russia is currently undermining the economic and military development of "Manchukuo" in all aspects, and recruiting "Manchukuo" personnel into the Communist Party in order to disrupt peace and hinder progress. This plan is a measure to prevent direct conflict between Japan and Russia. The US Consul General in Harbin, Hanson, and the Russian Consul General, Slavutsky, have been negotiating for several months to seek transfer rights within the Primorsky Krai of Soviet Russia for a certain government. These negotiations have yielded results. The purpose of Soviet Russia granting these transfer rights is to establish a barrier of a third country to protect the Primorsky Krai from Japanese invasion. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Recently, a Soviet Russian official hinted to an American who visited Russia that after the United States recognizes Soviet Russia, it can obtain an air base on the Siberian continent. However, according to reliable sources today, the United States currently has no intention of such a base. It is said that an American has friends in the State Department, which the Russian official knew, so he made this insinuation in the hope of conveying it to the State Department. However, his wording was extremely clever, making it easy to deny or abandon it later. Later, a Russian in Paris hinted to the US side that if the United States could unconditionally recognize Soviet Russia, Russia would be willing to provide the United States with a site to build an air base on the coast or islands of the Primorsky Krai in the East Sea. It is said that the Russian official stated when making this insinuation that it could not happen until diplomatic relations were restored. Therefore, if the Japanese were to suspect, the Russian official could easily deny that there was such a proposal. However, after hearing this insinuation, people in the Army and Navy in Washington did not pay much attention to it, because an air base on the continent has little relevance to the US islands. However, after hearing this news, the Japanese Army and Navy officers paid attention to it and pointed out that the United States will obtain some kind of colonial privilege in Soviet Russia. US officials remain silent on the issue of Soviet Russia. It is said that none have proposed it for formal consideration. US President Roosevelt stated today that he is waiting for a suitable time before handling the resumption of diplomatic relations. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on the 3rd that after the Soviet Russian government concluded non-aggression treaties with its European neighbors, it was able to avoid the threat of invasion from the West. However, in the Far East, it is taking aggressive offensive measures. Recently, it decided on the following outline of its Far East policy: (1) Hinder the economic and military construction of "Manchukuo" and crush the reinforcement works of Japanese imperialism, while preventing the danger of conflict between Japan and Russia; (2) Temporarily concede to Japan's provocative behavior and abandon the Chinese Eastern Railway under the most favorable conditions; (3) Select outstanding Manchurian people who are well-versed in Japanese and "Manchu" top-level policies and provide them with communist education, and after the Chinese Eastern Railway is abandoned, spread disturbing cells in Manchuria; (4) Transfer the forest logging rights and mining rights of the Primorsky Krai to the United States as a barrier against Japanese invasion and attack; (5) Support China's anti-Japanese movement and destroy the attempt to combine the Japanese and "Manchu" political and economic alliance. It is heard that the issue of transferring the rights and interests of the Primorsky Krai has been secretly discussed by the Soviet Russian Consul General in Harbin, Slavuk, and the US Consul General, Hanson, several times in recent months, and it is feared that a secret agreement has been established. Therefore, our country (Japan) attaches great importance to its policy towards Soviet Russia in the future.</p>

<p>The concentration of the US Navy in the Panama Canal and various ports in the southern United States has a good influence on the Cuban Revolutionary Committee, enough to urge its military and political leaders to resolve disputes and jointly plan for the country, so that the United States does not have to send troops to land.

Only the secretary of the US Embassy boarded the ship to meet him.

What we cannot forget is that the Cuban extremists are taking advantage of the revolutionary tide to rise up and act. If the United States interferes and leads to resistance from the Cuban army, these people will use the opportunity to create serious incidents.

The Japanese naval authorities issued informal opinions as follows: The US's military and economic interests in Cuba are just like Japan's relations with Manchuria. That is, if the US wants to guarantee the right of navigation in the Panama Canal, it is absolutely necessary to ensure various rights in the treaty with Cuba. The US has invested huge capital in Cuba, equivalent to the capital Japan invested in Manchuria before the Manchurian Incident. All kinds of economic interests were involved. The anti-American riots in Cuba this time were to protect its overseas Chinese and interests, and the US plans to implement extraordinary measures. This is exactly the same as the actions taken by Japan during the Manchurian Incident. It is an unavoidable act of self-defense. It is expected that the US government will now be able to understand Japan's position at that time. (9th Japanese Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Baghdad, August 8 (Reuters) The new King of Iraq, Ghazi I, is very popular. He is only twenty-one years old and is the only son of King Faisal. As for the cause of King Faisal's death, according to a telegram from the capital of Switzerland today, it was due to scleroderma, which he had suffered from for many years. This time, the scleroderma suddenly hardened completely, probably caused by the fatigue of traveling in Interlaken yesterday. The car he was riding in mistakenly entered a side road, causing it to drive into the high mountains and unable to get out for a long time. This caused the King's atrial blood pressure to increase. After the King had a slight dinner, his limbs twitched and turned cold, so he was massaged and injected. Then the King said that everything was normal and only left one nurse by his bedside. At midnight, the King's physical condition suddenly changed drastically and he passed away within half an hour. The owner of the hotel also died of illness that morning. King Ghazi won the hearts of the people, so his father's death did not cause any disputes.</p>

<p>A telegram from Chuansha to the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper to be forwarded to all national organizations, charitable institutions, and philanthropists: Chuansha County's Hengsha and Gao Deng sands are isolated overseas with a low-lying terrain. Over 10,000 residents depend on agriculture for their livelihood. This month, a sudden typhoon struck at dusk, causing a surge of sea tides and flooding the flatlands to a depth of several feet. The disaster is extremely severe, with over 800 houses destroyed and over 200 people drowned. Crops have been completely submerged, and the autumn harvest is entirely hopeless. Currently, there are no less than 10,000 disaster victims without homes, crying for food. This is truly an unprecedented and enormous catastrophe. This committee, in its capacity as the voice of the people, cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, we issue this telegram, appealing to all sectors to have a charitable heart and provide relief to save these distressed people from fire and water, and to alleviate the great calamity by even a fraction. In this urgent telegram, we express our utmost anticipation. Respectfully, The Chuansha County District Executive Committee Directly Under the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<p>| | To Return to Beijing in One Week to Report | |</p>
<p>A Jining correspondence reports that today (the 7th) at 11:45 AM, Mei Yilin, a special envoy from the Central Government, arrived in Yanzhou from Beijing via the Tianjin-Pukou No. 2 train to investigate the disaster situation in Western Shandong. When Mei arrived at Yanzhou Station, Li Shuchun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Xin Zhujiu, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Relief Committee, and others were at the station to greet him. After Mei disembarked, he went with Li and Xin to Jindehui to rest. According to Mei, the mission and thoughts of this trip were as follows: "I am here purely to inspect the disaster situation in Shandong Province. I have also met with the representatives of Shandong who are petitioning for relief in Beijing. Because Minister Song is attending the Lushan Conference, he is very concerned about the flood disaster, so he specially sent me to inspect the disaster area to determine the allocation of relief funds and the overall plan for disaster relief. It is reported that the disaster in Shandong this time was unexpected. Both Minister Song and I are very clear about this. Originally, the flood control measures of Shandong River Works were handled by Chairman Han and were extremely solid. I have also heard that the county magistrates in charge of river management are guarding the dikes at all times, exceeding even the defenses of the sages of the past. Unfortunately, the breach of the long dike in Hebei caused the flowing water to affect Shandong Province, resulting in this huge disaster, which is very regrettable. Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei, who was recently in Beijing, spoke about this matter and was also deeply apologetic, but it was really beyond human power. Fortunately, Chairman Han tried his best to prevent and control the situation earlier and raised and petitioned for relief later, so he can be considered to have done his duty to the people and is very admirable. I urgently want to see the disaster situation first. If there is a railcar to save time, I will immediately go to Jining because Minister Song will return to Beijing in one week, so I will report first in one or two days so that I can go to Kaifeng and Lanfeng for inspection as soon as possible. I will return to Beijing in about a week." After speaking, he and Li and Xin boarded the original special train at 1:30 PM and headed to Jining. The train traveled very fast, arriving in Jining at 2:30 PM. Military police were on guard at the station. After Mei and others disembarked, they took a car to the Jifeng Flour Mill to meet with representatives of the disaster victims and inquire about the disaster situation. County Magistrate Lin Kaitai, along with Brigade Commander Zhang Shulin, visited Mei and Li and reported on the recent flood situation, saying that Chairman Han's special train had transported refugees. Because the refugees still had a good autumn harvest, it was difficult to move their homes, so they had not gone elsewhere. Mei and Li comforted the representatives with kind words. That evening, Mei telegraphed to summon the county magistrates of the disaster areas to come to Jining quickly to inquire about everything in person. At 5:00 AM tomorrow (the 8th), he took a boat from the canal into the Shushui River to survey the disaster areas at the border between Jining, Jiaxiang, Wenshang, Junlukou, and Jinxiang.</p>

<p>After the district, he turned back to Jinan that night. At 4:00 AM on the 9th, he transferred to a car and went to Puyuan and Shouyang counties, planning to return to Jinan that night to meet with Han and then turn to Kaifeng and Lanfeng to inspect everything. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">He and Zhang Telegraph the Central Government to Resolve the Hankou Postal Strike <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Postal Workers' Union Has Sent Representatives to Hankou to Mediate</p>
<p>Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government Convene Mediation Meeting</p>
<p>A correspondence from Hankou reports that the Hankou postal workers' strike, which began on the 5th and has drawn the attention of society, has reached its deadline today. Director-General Shi Missi has not yet provided a satisfactory response, and various parties are deeply concerned about this. To prevent the situation from escalating, the National Postal Workers' Union has specially dispatched Standing Committee Members Lu Jingshi and Zhao Shusen to Hankou to be responsible for mediation. They have already arrived in Beijing from Shanghai and contacted Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua. According to Lu and Zhao, the Ministry of Communications has no prejudices against the workers' demands and can resolve the matter satisfactorily. They will also come to Hankou from Beijing. Although the Post Office has not yet received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Communications, the atmosphere has been eased somewhat. Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun and Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Qun believe that the postal service is extremely important to transportation and should not be allowed to have any more unfortunate incidents. They have telegraphed the Central Government and the Ministry of Communications separately, requesting that they quickly find a way to resolve the matter. The Hankou Special Municipality Party Committee and Municipal Government also jointly convened a mediation meeting on the 8th. The Municipal Party Committee sent Standing Committee Member Wu Shaoshu, and the Municipal Government sent Mayor Wu Guozhen. Han Dayong, Ning Kuanchen, Zhang Enze, Zeng Qingzao, Li Shujie, Dai Songqiao, Chen Liang, and Wang Dingyi, executive committee members of the Postal Workers' Union, and Wang Bangxin, Zhang Taihua, Peng Shizhen, Yin Jiechao, Luo Ziqi, Li Xianglin, and Zhang Xuxun, supervisory committee members, and workers' representatives Li Liqiang, Hu Ke, Liu Wenbing, Peng Haiqing, Guo Yizhang, Tang Yaohuang, Shi Wenan, Li Xiaochun, Zhang Shiyuan, and Liu Jichang all attended. Wu Shaoshu and Wu Guozhen repeatedly urged them to negotiate peacefully. As a result, it was decided to await the telegram from the Central Government and the Ministry of Communications to Hankou and then discuss the matter further. In addition, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters expressed its opinion, saying that it was regrettable that the postal workers went on strike for two hours. During this period of suppressing the Red bandits, any strike is sufficient to endanger public security and is not only an economic loss. Moreover, postal personnel are one type of national civil servant, and their work has a global nature, so it cannot be regarded as a local issue. If postal workers have any objections to the government's handling of the matter, they can peacefully request a resolution through legitimate and legal means. If, unfortunately, a strike or work slowdown occurs, disrupting the order and tranquility of Wuhan, the headquarters will have to take emergency suppression measures based on its position. (8th)</p>

<p>All Generals from Eastern Hubei Attend</p>
<p>Decide on Plans for Bandit Suppression, Village Clearing, and Post-Disaster Relief</p>
<p>A correspondence from Hankou reports that He Chengjun, Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, departed from Hankou on the 7th to inspect Eastern Hubei, passing through Huangpi and Qiting before arriving at Songbu. The generals from nearby areas had gathered there in advance to greet him. Because He was tired from the car journey, he only inquired about the recent situation of bandit suppression in various places and the actual situation of the people that evening. On the morning of the 8th, at 9:00 AM, he formally held a military conference. The attending generals included Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 26th Route Army, Liu Maoen, Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Column, Shangguan Yunxiang, Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Column, Hao Mengling, Commander of the 9th Army, Peng Zhenshan, Commander of the 30th Army, Wan Yaohuang, Commander of the 13th Division, Song Tiancai, Commander of the 75th Division, Gan Fang, Chief of Staff of the 2nd Column Headquarters, and Xu Liding, Chief of Staff of the 45th Division. The scope of discussion included: (1) Bandit Suppression, (2) Village Clearing, (3) Post-Disaster Relief. It is reported that new plans have been decided and will be implemented step by step. In general, within bandit-infested areas, they will use all their strength to suppress and destroy the main force; in semi-bandit-infested areas, they will implement village clearing to annihilate the remnants; in bandit-free areas, they will assist the local government in handling post-disaster relief and restoring vitality. He will stay in Songbu for two more days and then go to Huangma and other places for inspection. The generals are scheduled to return to their respective defenses on the 9th. To provide relief to the refugees in the area, the Provincial Government has twice ordered the Civil Affairs Department to allocate relief funds: 15,000 yuan were allocated the first time, with Zhong Wenzao in charge of distribution; 20,000 yuan were allocated the second time, with Lei Binghun in charge of distribution. A refugee camp was also established at Qiliping in Huang'an. The number of refugees returning from the bandit areas is increasing daily, and the benefits are considerable.</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Henan-Hubei-Anhui Border Area Bandit Suppression, believing that Chairman Chiang had issued an edict to employ local gentry, following the examples of Zeng and Hu, and that it was necessary to engage in the restoration of rural villages as the bandit areas were successively recovered, decided that local gentry were the most suitable for this task. Therefore, he decided to establish rural personnel training classes in Macheng, Huang'an, and Lishan in Eastern Hubei, Shangcheng and Jingfu in Southern Henan, and Lihuang in Western Anhui. The gentry from each county must participate in the training, with 150 people per class, graduating in two months. The expenses are tentatively set at 1,500 yuan per month, with each district administrative commissioner preparing a budget and submitting it to the department for transfer to the governments of the three provinces for appropriation.

<p>A correspondence from Hankou reports that Hubei Province, in the aftermath of floods and bandit troubles, has exhausted its finances, and various constructions have almost completely stopped. However, highway construction, because it is related to bandit suppression and military affairs, has been strictly supervised by the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters and is still being carried out diligently. In total, about 4,000 li of highways have been completed and are open to traffic throughout the province, through provincial and commercial efforts. The headquarters, believing that many sections in Western and Southern Hubei are still incomplete, has raised 150,000 yuan to repair the roads in the Shihe area of Western Hubei and is urging the Provincial Government to quickly draft a plan to start construction as soon as possible. Yesterday, it also ordered the Provincial Government to raise a large sum of money specifically for the construction of highways in Chongyang, Tongshan, and Yangxin counties in Southern Hubei. The route design and engineering progress will be the responsibility of the Construction Department. A survey of the completed roads is as follows:</p>

In the relatively flat areas of Chaozhou, artificial canals are dug to divert river water from culverts in the embankments into the canals. These canals wind around the plains in a spiral shape, providing irrigation and also serving for the transportation of agricultural products. In areas farther from the rivers, farmland relies more on ponds and wells to store water for use during droughts. In years of favorable weather, after the harvest of early and late rice, vegetables are also planted. People in Chaozhou utilize low-lying and wet areas to grow water chestnuts, lotus roots, and gorgon fruit, while higher areas are mostly used to grow leafy vegetables, and sandy embankments are mostly used to grow sugarcane and taro as side businesses. In recent years, the special tax on imported sugar has made sugar-producing households quite profitable. However, the sugarcane planting period is relatively long, planted in March this year and only harvested in December to extract juice and make sugar. This spring, there was a severe drought in the counties of Chaozhou and Meizhou, and rice-growing families only harvested 30-40% of their crops. Among them, many who could not cultivate or transplant rice switched to planting taro and miscellaneous grains, so they were not completely disappointed despite the drought. Moreover, there was a large stock of imported rice in Shantou. Merchants rushed to import large quantities of Siamese and Burmese rice due to the spring drought and the country's tumultuous times, so the drought did not significantly affect the food supply for the people. The only ones to be pitied were the farmers who worked hard but could not get enough to eat. This summer, the weather has been hot and extremely dry. Farmland throughout Chaozhou and Meizhou has been cracked by the sun, and seedlings have withered. Sugarcane and orchards have completely withered. At that time, farmers tried their best to remedy the situation. To avoid the scorching sun, they would go to the fields to irrigate in the evening, drawing water into the fields all night long. Family members, fathers, sons, men, women, old and young, took turns working until the next morning. However, it had been a long time without rain, and the rivers, canals, ponds, and marshes were completely dry. There was no water to irrigate, and no water to draw. At this point, they were at a loss, waiting for death. In the coastal counties of Chaoyang, Jieyang, Huilai, Raoping, Chenghai, because the upstream rivers had dried up, at first, each village blocked the river channels in the rivers to store water for irrigation. This not only hindered traffic but also caused water disputes and fights in the villages. However, as the river water dried up, the tides rose higher and higher, and the river water became salty. When farmers used it to irrigate their fields, the rice seedlings all rotted. In Chaoyang County, a type of pest similar to locusts emerged. Because the soil was dry, the insects crawled out of the mud and first ate the stalks of the ears. As the insects grew wings, they flew to other fields and multiplied easily. Moreover, during the drought, the northwest wind blew every morning and evening. When the wind blew, the heat felt like fanning a fire. The temperature at noon was often between 94 and 96 degrees, causing farmers in various counties to suffer from heatstroke and vomiting while working hard in the heat. Many children died from dysentery, and livestock such as cattle, pigs, and chickens suffered from epidemics. In Fengshun, almost no chicks were left to breed. According to the Chaozhou and Meizhou seasonal calendar, the southeast wind should blow after the Beginning of Autumn. When the east wind rises, yellow croaker from the sea come to market. When the south wind rises, there is rain and dew, and the fields can be moistened. However, the weather this autumn is abnormal. The northwest wind blows every morning and the southwest wind blows every afternoon. People feel thirsty, and excessive drinking or seeking coolness leads to illness. The fields have been exposed to the sun and scorched by the wind. The heat has dried everything up. Heaven's will is such that it cannot be remedied by human effort. The spring drought has just passed, and the autumn drought has come again. The tax burden on the people is increasing day by day. What can we do? The tragic situation has already occurred. Fertilizer merchants and soybean cake merchants in Shantou have no one inquiring about their goods in the warehouses because the opportunity to fertilize farmland has passed. They are willing to reduce the price by one-third. (Originally, soybean cake was 7 yuan per 100 catties, but now it has dropped to 5 yuan and still no one is asking about it.) Soybean cake fertilizer merchants have always extended credit to rural areas. This spring, they have received less than 30% of the accounts receivable. There is no business this autumn, which has led to a tight credit situation. Many of those who operate this business in Shantou also do banking, remittance, and ship rental businesses. Now this industry has been affected by the drought and has had a significant impact on the market. The Shantou market this autumn is unusually cold. Although the prices of goods in various industries have fallen, no one is asking about them. Everywhere, difficulties are exposed, and purchasing power is weak. All cash has been absorbed by taxes and special assessments. In the face of the disaster, the market is an empty shell. We are all in the same boat, which is a serious problem at present.

<p>The county government received a secret order from the provincial government, forwarding instructions from Chairman Chiang to recruit and transport soldiers for application. The county government informed the Public Security Bureau and the district offices to comply accordingly. The first and twelfth districts of this county each recruited eight soldiers, and the remaining districts each recruited six soldiers, within a specified period. It is now known that the county has recruited seventy soldiers, which meets the quota. The county will prepare a document and dispatch Police Team and Water Patrol Team Leader Shen Bangda with police officers to escort them to the province tomorrow (10th) by car.</p>

<p>The Finance Department stated that the taxes owed by various counties over the years have exceeded tens of millions. At a time when the provincial treasury is empty, it issued a notice to various counties to collect and remit taxes within a specified period. If households that owe large amounts refuse to comply, they will be arrested and forced to pay. Commissioner Shen Zhenglin was appointed to come to Songjiang to oversee the collection and issue a public notice with County Magistrate Jin to make it known.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Reaction to the Reward System for Cleaning Up Tax Arrears in Jiading <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Finance Department appointed Jiang Shuiyi as the Commissioner for Cleaning Up Old Taxes in Jiading and Baoshan counties. He arrived in Jiading the day before yesterday to clean up old taxes from the 16th to the 20th year of the Republic, and will receive a 10% bonus from the collected tax arrears, with 30% going to the County Magistrate, 25% to the Commissioner, and 45% to the staff involved. Upon hearing this news, various agencies believed that the bonus system would harm the revenue of various agencies in the county. On the afternoon of the 7th, they gathered at the County Party Headquarters to discuss how to deal with it. Fourteen representatives from the Property Management Office, Public Security Bureau, Education Bureau, and district offices attended. Zhou Gongli, the Executive Committee member of the County Party, chaired the meeting. The results of the discussion were: (1) The regular tax and surtax in this county have always been separated. Fees and late payment fines are only added to the regular tax, so the 10% bonus can only be drawn from the provincial tax items. (2) The military advances and farmers' bank advances that the province should return to this county were used to offset the land tax collected from the 16th to 19th years, according to the instructions of the provincial government last year. This item of people's debt is nominally provincial money, but it has actually been transferred to local funds, adding an extra burden. The local expenditure is reduced by one unit, and a bonus is to be extracted from it, so the Finance Department should find another way. (3) The old arrears of the 20th year have been included in this year's budget for repaying the advances of various agencies. After the bonus is extracted, it will be impossible to make up for it. (4) Based on the above reasons, the County Party Headquarters should submit a request to the Provincial Party Headquarters to forward it to the Provincial Government, instructing the Finance Department to be flexible in collecting old arrears and extracting bonuses in this county, and to consider the special circumstances of this county and find another bonus. In addition, various agencies should jointly submit a request to the Provincial Department and forward it to the Finance Department through the county, asking them to consider the special circumstances of this county and find another bonus.</p>

<p>Xia Yunsheng, a farmer in Tangzhuang Village, five miles from the city, had an argument with Fei Afu, a servant of Mao Guisheng's family in the same village, around 6:00 PM on the 7th. First, they cursed at each other, then they started fighting. Xia then used an iron shovel to crack Fei Afu's head, and blood flowed continuously. After being hit, Fei dared not show weakness and stabbed Xia in the abdomen several times with a small knife left behind by the army before escaping. After being stabbed, Xia died in the evening due to excessive blood loss. At 5:00 AM on the 8th, the murderer Fei Afu learned of this and surrendered to the Public Security Police Station outside Xiaoximen. Section Chief Dong immediately went to Tangzhuang to investigate and took Xia's widow, Xia Xia, to the station along with the murderer Fei Afu to be handed over to the County Bureau, which reported to the County Government to send personnel to examine the body. County Magistrate Cheng, upon receiving the report, appointed Yin Youxin, the Chief of the First Section of the Public Security Bureau, to take the examiner to the countryside to examine the body. It was found that Xia Yunsheng had been stabbed in the abdomen and died. He filled out the coroner's report and ordered the family to collect the body and return to the county to report.</p>

<p>A kidnapping case occurred in Dangqiankou, the details of which were recorded in the previous newspaper. The three kidnapped victims, Zhu Ni, Zhang, and Ji Wang, escaped safely yesterday (7th). According to their account of the escape, the bandit ship encountered water police and anti-bandit troops outside Daan Port that day and engaged in a fierce battle. The bandits were unable to hold out and took the hostages to shore and fled. The police team tracked them down, so they were able to take the opportunity to escape and hide in the homes of nearby farmers. The farmers gave them two yuan for travel expenses and showed them the way home. They took a boat home and said that after being kidnapped, they were imprisoned in the bottom of the cabin and subjected to insults and suffering.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Strike at the Qianfeng Silk Factory <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Qianfeng Silk Factory (formerly Wufeng) in Zhou Shanbang, north of Xinjiao, is managed by Manager Wang Hunan. There are more than a thousand female workers in the factory. The general manager is Zhou Yanru. Recently, all duties related to collecting cocoons in the countryside have been temporarily taken over by Gao Zuhe, who manages the machines. Gao took this opportunity to try to exclude Zhou so that he could succeed as general manager. He was very attentive to the manager but was violent and oppressive towards the female workers. Even for a minor mistake, they would be scolded severely or have their wages deducted. The day before yesterday afternoon, he advocated extending the working hours by half an hour and adding a reel of raw silk, which caused the female workers to feel pain and oppose it. Yesterday, when the factory released them to work, they went on strike. Later, Wang Yuchu and Huang Huilan, two officers sent by the Silk Factory Trade Union, came forward to mediate. Wang Axiu and two other representatives of the female workers made three demands: (1) Cancel the additional spinning of silk during supper. (2) Cancel the addition of a reel of raw silk at 6:00 PM. (3) Cancel the distinction between fine and coarse and do not allow public insults. Because Manager Wang Hunan had gone to Shanghai and had not returned, the factory temporarily accepted the above three points and waited for Manager Wang to return to Wuxi to resolve them. The female workers were satisfied, and the strike was ended after three hours, and work was resumed.</p>

<p>Zhu Xufan, the Standing Chairman of the Local Explosives Industry Association, reported that Fu Huanzeng, the Director of the Wuxi Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau, sent many inspectors every four or five days to turn over boxes and chests in the stores and arbitrarily search them, abusing their power and hindering business. He appealed for relief. He then forwarded a letter to the bureau to inform them. However, Fu, on the pretext that the format of the association's letter was not in compliance, returned the original letter. His intention to connive with inspectors in illegal searches was clear. Therefore, he specially presented a petition to the county government, requesting that they show mercy to the weak merchants and provide assistance, promptly order the director to be brought to justice, severely interrogate him, and request the Jiangsu Provincial Saltpeter and Sulfur General Bureau to dismiss the director of the bureau and investigate him. After receiving the petition, County Magistrate Yan issued an order to the director of the bureau to make a statement for verification.</p>

After getting off the train at around 10:00 AM, they changed to a steamship and went to the Minfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate for inspection. They also visited nearby cocoon businesses to observe the cocoon weighing process and examine the quality of autumn cocoons. They then had lunch at the factory. In the afternoon, they went to the Huaxin Silk Factory for a visit. At 5:44 PM, they took the train to Zhenjiang to visit the Improvement Association and will discuss the issue of silkworm seed control with Director Ge Jingzhong. In addition, 139 autumn cocoon businesses have been opened in the four countryside of this county, and the goods arriving are also very enthusiastic. The price of high-quality cocoons is said to be 45 yuan.</p>

Fearing that bandits will covet them and unfortunate incidents such as interception will occur, he specially petitioned the Jiangdu County Government to order the public security bureaus and garrison police teams under its jurisdiction to cooperate in protecting the cocoon industry for the sake of prevention. County Magistrate Ma issued an order to the Public Security Bureau and the Police Team to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e104">What Insured Persons Should Know by Zhang Sixu <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The benefits of the life insurance system are understood by the people in European and North American countries, so the huge funds accumulated and managed by each life insurance company from the premiums of the insured can become the sacred property of the people. It is not only the lifeblood of the insured, but also the lifeline of the entire country.</p>
<p>Today, why do life insurance companies in the United States occupy an important position in their domestic economic structure? It is because the funds of each life insurance company are used to develop various public utilities, construction projects, and other investments that benefit the people.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's life insurance business has made rapid progress. In the future, it will certainly become a great business, so in recent years, many life insurance companies have been organized and established one after another. But we should also have a clear understanding, because the property of life insurance companies is the precious funds of the people; life insurance premiums are not only the lifeblood of the insured, but the lifeline of the entire country.</p>
<p>For this reason, the insured should know which insurance company's assets are used to develop our country's economy, and then apply for insurance. There are many foreign life insurance companies in China whose head offices are located abroad and have opened branches in China to do a lot of business. The premiums they receive in our country are not used to develop our country's various public welfare undertakings but are taken to their head office locations, such as Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, for investment. It is difficult to get an accurate figure for the money flowing out of our country from premiums for the time being, but it is estimated to be no less than 10 million yuan per year. This is truly a kind of invisible great loss for our country. Others use the life insurance business to develop their country's economic construction, but our country suffers an invisible loss of tens of millions of yuan every year because of life insurance, which is a heartbreaking fact. Compatriots who are interested in life insurance should be vigilant and choose wisely.</p>
<p>From the perspective of national investment, China now has several well-managed Chinese life insurance companies that are beneficial to the insured, especially China United Life Insurance Company, which is the leader in the Chinese life insurance industry. All their management is under the management of personnel who are very well-trained in the life insurance business, which can be said to be the best life insurance agency for Chinese people. At the same time, there are also several companies such as Taisan, Sincere, Wing On, and NingShao, which are also Chinese organizations and are good life insurance agencies for Chinese people.</p>
<p>There are also one or two foreign companies in China that were organized and established in Shanghai and Hong Kong, with their head offices in Shanghai, such as AIA Life Insurance Company and Cigna Insurance Company. Although they are subject to the supervision of the laws of the United Kingdom and the United States, they collect premiums from Chinese people and still invest in China. In practice, these two companies bring the premiums they receive from their branches in the Philippines, British Straits Settlements, and other places to China for investment every year. Therefore, these companies are different from the companies mentioned above that take Chinese premiums and invest them abroad. Currently, when our country welcomes foreign investment, these companies are also worthy of our attention. In short, life insurance is the best way to invest, but we should use our premiums to develop China's economic construction.</p>

<p>丨Passed the examination for life insurance sales specialist last year</p>
<p>丨Now he has also obtained a diploma in life insurance sales management</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Deyi has a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is especially skilled in all subjects of life insurance. After returning to China, he served as a specialist accountant in China United Life Insurance Company, etc. He is currently an inspector in the management department of the company for many years. Mr. Zhang is diligent and tireless. While promoting sales, he still studies hard and seeks to deepen his knowledge. The director of the life insurance sales specialist university in the United States is Dr. Xu Benna, who came to China a few years ago and is globally respected as a scholar in the life insurance industry. Only in the previous year was President Bu Fangji of St. John's University entrusted with the examination of life insurance sales specialists. Mr. Zhang passed the examination and obtained a diploma, making him the only specialist in this field in China. This summer, in June, the university again invited President Bu to supervise the examination of life insurance sales management. This subject is more advanced, and those who do not hold a diploma in sales specialization are not allowed to take the examination. Mr. Zhang also passed the examination and received a letter from Dr. Xu Benna yesterday, stating that the diploma would be mailed soon and congratulating Mr. Zhang on this new honor as the first person in China to obtain this diploma.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Preserving Savings and Bank Savings: An Old Treatise <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>People invariably consider the issue of savings important. The method of ancient savings was to accumulate one year's worth of produce after three years of cultivation, and three years' worth after nine years. Later, with the evolution of society, savings banks were established. Those who invested in banks gained considerable interest in addition to their savings principal. This method of saving far surpassed that of ancient times. Recently, life insurance companies have sprung up like mushrooms in Europe and America. As a result, the amount of idle funds concentrated in life insurance companies is consistently greater than that in savings banks. This is simply because bank savings have a straightforward meaning, while life insurance savings, in addition to balancing principal and interest, also offer a tangible form of security. Therefore, informed individuals value bank savings but place even greater emphasis on life insurance savings. Here, we will list the advantages and disadvantages of life insurance savings compared to bank savings, and upon careful examination of their meanings, the differences will become clear.</p>
<p>One: Bank savings return the principal upon maturity, and life insurance savings invariably return the principal upon maturity as well. Banks return the principal with added interest, and life insurance returns the principal with added dividends. These are their similarities. However, if a depositor unfortunately dies prematurely, the life insurance company fulfills its insurance contract and compensates according to the insured amount, regardless of how much has been paid in premiums. With bank savings, there is no compensation, and the contract contains various restrictions on withdrawing savings midway. This is their difference.</p>
<p>Two: Life insurance savings can transform uncertain amounts into definite amounts because the life insurance policy someone purchases always has a fixed value. For example, a life insurance policy of ten thousand yuan, regardless of its term, has a value of ten thousand yuan once the first premium is paid. Life is fleeting, and life and death cannot be predicted. Holding a policy worth a certain amount of money guarantees an inheritance of that amount. The ultimate goal of saving will certainly be achieved one day. Can bank savings do this? How many people save in banks year after year, only to encounter misfortune, death, or disability midway, preventing them from completing their plans?</p>
<p>Three: Bank savings lack the element of forced saving. Often, due to temporary needs, accumulated funds are quickly withdrawn. Furthermore, banks do not notify term depositors in advance when their payments are due, as life insurance companies do for policyholders, and do not include grace periods for payment in their contracts. Therefore, bank depositors often forget and fail to continue their savings plans. Easily withdrawing funds and easily forgetting to pay are not the best methods of saving. However, life insurance savings have various methods to ensure that the goal of saving is consistently achieved.</p>
<p>Four: The general opinion is that the interest on bank savings is invariably more favorable than that of life insurance. However, the level of interest has no fixed standard. For example, if someone named A purchases a twenty-year term life insurance policy for one thousand yuan at the age of forty, paying approximately forty-seven yuan in premiums each year, and dies from illness within the first year, the compensation received, compared to the principal, is more than twenty times the benefit. If they die after paying premiums for ten years, the compensation received is still about two and a half times the benefit. If even a small amount is spent to insure against accidents, the ratio of benefits to premiums paid in the event of an accident is often thirty or forty times as much. Bank savings would never offer such favorable interest.</p>
<p>The above points sufficiently distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of bank savings compared to life insurance savings. In terms of credit, banks often experience runs, while life insurance companies have a fixed contract, and funds cannot be returned before maturity or compensation paid before death. There is absolutely no concern about bankruptcy due to runs, as can be seen from insurance companies in England and America.</p>
<h3 id="e108">A Brief History of 350 Years of Life Insurance <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>One: Origins</p>
<p>Life insurance has a history of 350 years, originating later than most major types of property insurance. In the mid-twelfth century, Greek and Roman merchants, in order to protect themselves from losses due to Mediterranean pirate robbery, organized a self-defense group to ensure mutual protection. This can be considered the first page in the history of insurance. The modern insurance system originated in England. In the sixteenth century, merchants engaged in maritime trade often gathered in a small coffee shop in London to discuss business and various events. In this place, the method of ship and cargo insurance was invented to protect against maritime dangers. This ship and cargo insurance was the beginning of human life insurance because, due to the dangers of navigation at the time, ship owners advocated providing adequate compensation and pensions to the families of sailors who lost their lives. On June 15, 1583, in the Royal Exchange of London, a man named William Gibbon signed the first life insurance policy. The policy stated that sixteen insurers were covering him for a period of one year, with an insured amount of 383 pounds. It stipulated that if Mr. Gibbon died during the coverage period, the insurers should compensate his son according to the insured amount. William Gibbon had already paid a premium of 8 pounds per 100 pounds. The premium rate of modern insurance companies is only about one pound per 100 pounds, which should be noted. The policy also included the following superstitious words: "May God grant William Gibbon health and longevity." Unfortunately, he passed away on May 29 of the following year. Calculating based on the Gregorian calendar, with 31 days per month, he died within the insurance validity period and should have been compensated. However, after his family submitted the claim, the insurers calculated the months according to the lunar calendar, with four weeks per month, instead of the Gregorian calendar, claiming that Mr. Gibbon died after the expiration of eleven lunar months and was not entitled to compensation according to the contract. Later, his family sued, and the court ruled in favor of the family. This groundbreaking first life insurance compensation was paid in full. From the signing of this historically valuable policy to this year marks 350 years, which is a very memorable event. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e109">How Life Insurance Benefits China's National Economy and People's Livelihood by Yu Ci <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Before discussing this topic, the author should first state that because the articles written are published in newspapers in installments rather than compiled into a book, readers do not have the opportunity to refer to them in sequence. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to reiterate previous points for clarity. The previous articles have mostly focused on the economic functions of the life insurance industry and explained its direct benefits to policyholders from an economic standpoint. However, the life insurance industry cannot be equated with ordinary commerce. The life insurance industry is by no means merely a profit-seeking endeavor. Its organization is originally seen as stemming from the principle of mutual aid and cooperation among people. Its nature belongs more to the meaning of "humanitarianism" and less to the intention of profit-making. In 1757, when the first life insurance company in England applied for a license, its petition stated, "The subjects of His Majesty, whose food and clothing rely on the provision of salaries, or the benefits of business, or the gains of labor, mostly desire to unite and insure each other, so that the benefits of the insured during their lifetime can be passed on to their families after their death and avoid the danger of freezing and starvation." These few words earnestly convey the original intention of the life insurance industry.</p>
<p>The spirit of mutual cooperation for public benefit in life insurance still exists in life insurance companies today, which are essentially specialized custodians of investments. As the life insurance industry gradually progresses, this spirit also expands and flourishes. Thus, in addition to the original economic benefits, several social benefits are added. What this article intends to particularly discuss are the prevention and treatment of diseases and the extension of the productive period of life. Life insurance companies, through in-depth and specialized research on human life, have established that heredity, climate, habits, occupation, environment, and lifestyle have extremely important relationships to the length of human life. The results of this research have greatly reduced the mortality rate of policyholders. Life insurance companies fully publicize their research findings, so the general public also benefits from them. Mr. Frankel of New York's Equitable Life Insurance Company once founded a special department called "Welfare" with the aim of instilling health knowledge and promoting human health, achieving excellent results. Most life insurance companies have recognized the necessity of establishing this specialized department, and the expenses incurred for it are more than compensated for by the reduction in mortality rates. This is because the results of this work have extended human life expectancy, reducing the need for payouts. It is said that newborns today have an average life expectancy of 58 years, while newborns in 1800 had an average life expectancy of only 35 years. The current extension of life expectancy has exceeded the former by two-thirds.</p>
<p>Regarding the popularization of knowledge about human life expectancy, no country lags behind more than China. Although the physical condition of policyholders is thoroughly examined by doctors, the mortality rate remains much higher than in other countries. Therefore, Chinese life insurance companies should urgently establish a "Welfare" department to implement health education for policyholders. The need for this is particularly acute. Moreover, Chinese people now pay considerable attention to hygiene matters. If life insurance companies can promptly respond to this demand, lead and promote it, they will surely receive even greater support and love from society. Even for their own benefit, this action cannot be delayed. The prosperity or decline of the life insurance industry is closely related to the length of policyholders' lives. It is said, "Spending one yuan on 'Welfare' work can save two yuan through the reduction of mortality rates." It can be seen that life insurance companies engaging in health movements and publicity is of great benefit to themselves. It is naturally necessary to limit policyholders to those who are healthy and have been certified by doctors. However, in other countries, life insurance companies also provide doctor services when policyholders become ill, while this is lacking in China. The author, having been involved in the Chinese life insurance business for 27 years, has seen many policyholders die unnecessarily due to the lack of modern medical treatment. For example, the number of Chinese people who die from cholera is unknown. Cholera was once an extremely dangerous disease in various countries. However, since the invention of saline injections, deaths from this disease have been drastically reduced. The author still remembers that this technique was brought to China by Dr. Coss. The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital was founded by the doctor, saving countless lives. Since this technique was adopted, the percentage of deaths from cholera has decreased from 85% to 15%. The author once visited this hospital when cholera was rampant. The rooms were full of people seeking treatment, with many lying in front of the hospital and on the steps, waiting for diagnosis. The author witnessed a patient whose complexion had changed, and death was imminent. However, after one injection, they recovered and were discharged from the hospital within hours. The rescue of their life was truly a miraculous event.</p>
<p>Life insurance companies should strive for health work and publicity to increase the life expectancy of policyholders, which is in line with the principles of the life insurance industry. Western countries have already done this and achieved results, so it is undoubtedly necessary for China to catch up quickly. Now, let us discuss the work of the "Welfare" department of New York's Equitable Life Insurance Company since its establishment in 1911, which may serve as a reference for Chinese life insurance companies. The department began its health education efforts by publishing health publications. Its first booklet was titled "The Fight Against Lung Disease." It was followed by a continuous stream of publications, all using simple language to explain how to maintain health, such as infant care, disease prevention, personal hygiene, and public health. Now, the scope of activities has expanded to include medical examinations, health exhibitions, film leaflets, etc., and it cooperates with various public and private health organizations to promote them vigorously. As a result of 21 years of effort, the mortality rate of the company's policyholders in 1932 was 33.4% lower than in 1911. In other words, as a result of the annual reduction in deaths, nearly 70,000 fewer policyholders died in that year alone. Therefore, it has naturally been loved by society.</p>
<p>The relationship between the life insurance system and policyholders is so close that it should evoke goodwill towards it in Chinese society. Recalling what the author has said in previous articles, life insurance companies must strive to protect the lives of policyholders, and their efforts must succeed. This can completely eliminate the superstitious mentality of Chinese people against life insurance.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the author's first article on life insurance stated, "Life insurance is one of the best methods for people to cooperate to improve human well-being, making wealth accessible to the common people, allowing for fair distribution, and eliminating abject poverty. The huge capital gathered by life insurance companies is the material manifestation of various excellent human psychological qualities, such as wisdom, frugality, and sacrifice." Now, as time passes, it increasingly proves the correctness of this statement. What needs to be added is that, in addition to the economic benefits it guarantees, the life insurance industry also makes continuous contributions to popularizing health education, improving human health, and extending the productive period of life. Health is the source of happiness. Only a healthy life has value, and only a life with value needs to be maintained.</p>

<h3 id="e110">[An Unprecedented Event Held Yesterday: Naming Ceremony for Five Aircraft] [P] More Than 100,000 Citizens Enthusiastically Participated Six or Seven Aircraft Soared in the Sky Naming Ceremony Completed and Immediately Presented to the Government The Five Aircraft Flew to Hangzhou Today to Return to Their Squadron The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Industry, Shanghai Schools, Shanghai Boy Scouts, and Ningbo, five aircraft of the Chinese Aviation Association, held a naming ceremony at the Hongqiao Airport at 2 p.m. yesterday, and the aircraft were also presented, took off, and performed in a small formation. Although it was early autumn yesterday, the sun was scorching, and the autumn sun was still hot, about 100,000 citizens participated in the ceremony. From noon onwards, they came in an endless stream, and vehicles did not stop. The aircraft were led by Mao Bangchu, the principal of the aviation school, and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, a total of fourteen aircraft. Now that the ceremony has been completed, they are scheduled to take off and return to Hangzhou this afternoon. The details are recorded as follows: =Hongqiao Road= The venue for the naming ceremony of the five aircraft was at the Hongqiao Airport. The only means of transportation from the city to that location is Hongqiao Road, which was built by the Concession. The municipal government was concerned that the traffic would be congested and disrupt transportation, so it specially ordered the Public Security Bureau to deploy more police officers to maintain order. However, several sections of the road were very narrow, and pedestrians walking along the road were shoulder-to-shoulder. There were even more cars that could not move forward. Before the wooden bridge in Hongqiao Town, the Public Works Department also sent West Indian mounted patrols to direct traffic. Yesterday afternoon, more than 100,000 people went to watch the ceremony. It is estimated that from noon to 3 p.m., the dust on Hongqiao Road never settled. =Strict Security= Yesterday, more than 1,200 people were responsible for security and maintaining order at the Hongqiao Airport, including a regiment of municipal security forces with more than 600 people, two squadrons of police brigades with more than 400 people, together with the original escort team of the Hongqiao Airport, the Pu Song District Defense Corps, and all the police officers of the First Branch of the Sixth District. Police officers from the First Branch of the Sixth District were deployed on Hongqiao Road to direct traffic. Inside the airport and at the entrances and exits, the police brigade, together with the Defense Corps, maintained order. The escort team was responsible for security around the aircraft parking area. As for the area around the Hongqiao Airport, the security forces set up sentry posts, and the security was quite tight. However, there were fewer posts on Hongqiao Road, which caused some traffic congestion. =A Glimpse of the Venue= The gate of the venue was at the end of Hongqiao Road, with a high colorful archway. Inside the gate, by the side of the road, was the final resting place of the righteous warrior Xiao Te. A cloth couplet was hung above, which guests could pay their respects to. The ceremony rostrum was at the east end of the venue, surrounded by ropes. Those with invitation cards could enter. A white cloth banner with the words "Naming Ceremony of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Industry, Shanghai Schools, Shanghai Boy Scouts, and Ningbo Aircraft of the Chinese Aviation Association" was hung in the middle of the rostrum. Four pairs of slogans were hung on the walls: 1. Today we celebrate the naming of the five aircraft and thank the government for its sincere assistance. 2. Today we celebrate the arrival of the five aircraft in Shanghai and welcome aviator Sun Tonggang. 3. We celebrate the naming of the five aircraft and thank the public organizations. 4. We celebrate the arrival of the five aircraft in Shanghai and thank the aviators who flew the aircraft. To the left and right were resting places, and there were temporary purchasing points for Guanshengyuan and Shunfeng brand fresh orange water. In front, the five aircraft named Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, etc., and the other nine aircraft that came with them, were lined up in a row in the venue with long ropes. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other aircraft were even covered with the national flag emblem. =Organizers= Yesterday's presidium included Yu Hongjun (representative of Mayor Wu), Lin Wo-jiang (Aviation Association), Zhu Xiaolai (Commerce), Zheng Hongnian (Schools), Tong Xingbai (Boy Scouts), Zhu Xuefan (Industry), and Yu Qiaqing (Ningbo), among others. The naming ceremony was hosted by the chairmen of each organization. The flag-raising ceremony was hosted by the wives of Lu Jing-shi (Industry), Yu Ti-ti (Ningbo), Chen Yu-ying (Boy Scouts), Zheng Bao-ning (Schools), and Wu Rui-lun (Commerce). The pilots were Gao Zhihang, Wang Tianxiang, Chen Jiashang, Liu Chao, Hu Jiamei, and Chen Qixia, instructors from the Hangzhou Aviation School. The general director of the conference was Li Dachao, the chief receptionist was Zhang Yanrong, and the master of ceremonies was Lin Yannan. =Agenda= (1) Music, (2) Singing the National Anthem, (3) Paying the highest respects to the national flag and the portrait of the Premier, (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will, (5) Report, (6) Speech, (7) Naming Ceremony, (8) Handover Ceremony, (9) Flag-raising Ceremony, (10) Performance, (11) Music, (12) Ceremony concluded. <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, the public's participation in the ceremony was exceptionally enthusiastic. Around the Hongqiao Airport, more than 10,000 people stood in the scorching sun. The crowd was dense, an unprecedented scene. The Central Committee of the Kuomintang specially sent Commissioner Yang Hu as a representative to participate nearby. The National Government specially sent Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration, as a representative to receive the aircraft. In addition, Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank of China, Zhang Xiang, Acting Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Lin Kang-hou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Lin Wo-jiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Aviation Office of the Navy Department, Zeng Yijing, Director of the Aircraft Manufacturing Office of the Navy, Legislative Member Wang Xiaoying, Sun Tonggang, a pilot who studied in Germany, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhu Qinglan, a member of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, Wang Yansong, a supervisor of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wu Yun-chu, Guo Shun, Jiang Songnian, etc., all attended.</p>

<p>Yu Hongjun, representing Mayor Wu Tiecheng, delivered a speech stating, "Today, the Chinese Aviation Association is holding the naming ceremony for the Shanghai Industry, Shanghai Commerce, Shanghai Schools, Shanghai Boy Scouts, and Ningbo aircraft. Mayor Wu is away from Shanghai on official business and is unable to attend in person. Hongjun is honored to be appointed as a representative to participate in this grand ceremony. In the past six months, the aviation patriotic movement in this city has relied heavily on the enthusiastic support and generous contributions from all sectors, and has achieved considerable results. The naming ceremony for the first Shanghai aircraft was held on June 1, and the grand and solemn, joyful and enthusiastic scene at that time is still deeply impressed in the minds of the people. Three months later, we are holding the naming ceremony for the Shanghai Industry, Shanghai Commerce, Shanghai Schools, Shanghai Boy Scouts, and Ningbo aircraft, and the grand and solemn, joyful and enthusiastic scene is no less impressive. This shows that the people's enthusiasm for aviation patriotism is very gratifying. Since the European War, countries have recognized the greatness of the air force and have concentrated their national strength and financial resources on the construction of the air force. According to the statistics of 1929, the air force equipment of various countries has made astonishing progress, especially France, which has more than 40,000 air force personnel and more than 16,000 aircraft. The second is the United Kingdom and the United States, each with about 6,000 to 7,000 aircraft. Russia has more than 4,000 aircraft, Italy has more than 3,000 aircraft, and Germany and Japan each have about 2,000 aircraft. Even small countries such as Poland, Switzerland, Spain, and Belgium have 400 to 500 aircraft. I think the recent strength of the air forces of various countries must have developed amazingly. Therefore, the achievements of the aviation patriotic movement in this city are still far from the strength of the air forces of the major powers. We not only cannot be complacent, but should also deeply reflect on ourselves and strive to catch up. However, when we hold the naming ceremony today, what we welcome and pay attention to is not the number of aircraft today, but the spirit of aviation patriotism of the people in the future and the knowledge and skills of aviation patriotism of the people. The former is the foundation for the development of the air force in the future, and the latter is the driving force for the construction of the air force in the future. Hongjun sincerely hopes that the people will continue the enthusiastic spirit of today, unite and rise up, and generously contribute, so that the strength of the Chinese air force can compete with the major powers. I especially hope that the people will work hard to cultivate knowledge and skills related to aircraft manufacturing, so that today's aviation patriotic movement of donating and purchasing aircraft can be transformed into an aviation patriotic movement of self-manufacturing aircraft. Then, aviation patriotism will not be empty talk, and the revival of the nation can be expected in the near future. At the same time, Hongjun, on the order of Mayor Wu, expresses his sincere welcome and admiration to aviator Sun Tonggang. Mr. Sun previously made a long-distance flight from Berlin, Germany, across Europe and Asia, and his spirit and perseverance have been admired by people at home and abroad. Now, with his ambition, he is making a great feat of flying across the country. His heroic ambition and spirit will revitalize the decadent, lazy, perfunctory, and complacent habits of the people across the country, and change the old, timid, cowardly, and empty talk roots of our nation. Mr. Sun's ambition and Mr. Sun's actions can be a model for the youth of the country, and can also be said to be a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation. In addition to welcoming him, we especially hope that people of insight across the country can rise up and follow in Mr. Sun's footsteps."</p>

<h3 id="e115">=Yang Xiaotian's Speech= <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Next, Yang Xiaotian, Director of the Shanghai Security Department and representative of the Central Government, delivered a speech. Mr. Yang said briefly, "Today, the Central Government has sent me here to participate in the naming ceremony of the five aircraft, and I feel very honored. However, I have a few thoughts. In recent years, there have been too many slogans for saving the country, such as education to save the country, science to save the country, and motors to save the country. It is really countless. However, shouting slogans is useless. There must be factual manifestations. Other things only shout slogans, but there are no facts. Only aviation to save the country has factual manifestations. All sectors of Shanghai are very enthusiastic about the aviation industry, and have provided great help in terms of material and spirit. The naming ceremony for the first Shanghai aircraft was held last time, and now the second aircraft naming ceremony is being held, and the number of aircraft has increased compared to before. This shows the enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai for patriotic sentiment and the loyalty of loving the central government. On behalf of the central government, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the citizens of Shanghai."</p>
<h3 id="e116">=Xu Peigen's Speech= <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mr. Xu Peigen, representing the Aviation Department of the National Government, delivered a speech, roughly stating that the key to establishing a nation lies first in national defense. A nation without defense is in greater danger. If, unfortunately, a national war breaks out, it is even more necessary for the government and the people to cooperate with one heart. Otherwise, the nation will fall into peril. Although China has had countless mass organizations in the past, they have not achieved significant results. Now, the mass organizations in Shanghai have actually purchased many airplanes and donated them to the government, which is a very significant achievement. Such rare achievements are worthy of remembrance, and the organizational strength of the masses can also be seen from this. We know that whether a nation can exist in the world depends first on whether they can protect their own nation. Whether the nation contributes money or labor to purchase airplanes, this is a manifestation of protecting their own nation. Although we can also find ways to expand from the sea and land, the air force is especially important today. To have the strength to defend ourselves, we must first expand the air force, because the air force can coordinate with the navy and army in combat. The citizens of Shanghai know to pay attention to air defense exercises, which is truly a great fortune for our nation. On behalf of the government, I express my deep gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e117">=Wang Xiaolai's Speech= <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, delivered a speech, roughly stating that Shanghai has already held a naming ceremony for the No. 1 airplane. Now, there are five more airplanes here to hold naming ceremonies. The Air Rescue Team has a total of eighteen airplanes, and ceremonies will be held one after another. From the surface, this seems like a spectacular action, but in reality, I feel deeply ashamed. Secretary-General Yu is right. What can we Chinese compare with foreign countries? Airplanes are bought from foreign countries, and sometimes we have to rely on foreign talents. Fortunately, we have a Mr. Sun Tonggang here to bring us honor. (Saying this, Wang Xiaolai urgently pulled Sun Tonggang from the stage, and the audience applauded greatly from below.) In the past, Mr. Yuan Zicai had two lines of poetry that said, "Ink marks on the pen and blood on the knife, to use them correctly is to be a hero." We hope that the talents in China who can pilot airplanes will all be like...</p>
<p>(Continued on page 17, section 5)</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>...Mr. Sun Tonggang, and will pilot airplanes to kill many people in the future. However, one thing is most important. We hope that airplanes will never be used to participate in internal wars. We remember the Sino-Japanese War, when we used the people's hard-earned money to buy a battleship from a foreign country, called Flying.... Unexpectedly, it did not kill the enemy and show off, but was only used once to capture Kang Youwei, and another time it was blown up for a certain Mr. Zhang. The people's hard-earned money was ultimately sacrificed for nothing, which is very heartbreaking. Therefore, future airplanes must absolutely not participate in internal wars, so as not to betray the good intentions of the masses who came here today to participate in the naming ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e118">=Tong Xingbai's Speech= <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mr. Tong Xingbai, representing the Boy Scout Council, delivered a speech, roughly stating that he was speaking on behalf of the Boy Scouts. Because today, one of the five airplanes is named Boy Scout, which represents considerable success. Unfortunately, Japan has airplanes that bomb everywhere, while China does not. Therefore, everyone realizes that the air force is the center of national defense. The Boy Scouts made every effort to raise donations, and as a result, achieved some success and were able to purchase an airplane. But this is the strength of the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Boy Scout Plane (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>However, it is expressed through the hands of the Boy Scouts. The Boy Scouts are originally opposed to war and advocate peace. However, peace must be built on justice and equality. The Boy Scouts are opposed to unjust and unequal peace. We must stop imperialists from attacking in order to maintain just and equal peace. Therefore, we must purchase airplanes to defend ourselves and eliminate the strong and violent. This is what my brothers said on behalf of them when the Boy Scout plane held its naming ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e120">=Sun Tonggang's Speech= <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mr. Sun Tonggang delivered a speech, roughly stating that he was very happy to participate in this ceremony. Today is the third day of my nationwide flight. I am especially happy to see that the citizens of Shanghai have bought so many airplanes. I hope that in the future, we can manufacture them ourselves. Today there are five, tomorrow there will be ten, and in a year we will build more than a thousand, as many as the flies and mosquitoes in China. Every citizen of our country pilots one to avenge our humiliation, and then we will be truly happy! Next, the Aviation Association thanked all parties for their kindness in participating.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Ningbo Plane (Photo by Xu Tianzhang) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>

<p>After the speeches, the naming ceremony was held. The executive personnel appointed by the five organizations went to the planes named Shanghai Merchant, Shanghai Worker, Boy Scout, Ningbo, and Shanghai School. Amidst the melodious sounds of the military band, they removed the national emblem covering the left and right wings and the tail of each plane. After each plane was named, the presidium appointed by the five organizations presented the handover certificate to Xu Peigen, the head of the Aviation Department representing the National Government, for acceptance. The handover certificate stated: "We respectfully observe that the state has the right to defend itself, and the people have the duty to donate. Now, we respectfully donate the Shanghai Merchant fighter plane raised by this association to the government to resist insults and defend the people. Each fulfills its responsibility, truly the boundless blessing of the party and the nation. China Aviation Association."</p>

<p>After the handover ceremony, they returned to the front of the planes.</p>
<p>The military band played again. Ms. Wu Ruilun of Shanghai Merchant, Ms. Zheng Baoning of Shanghai School, Ms. Chen Yuru of Shanghai Boy Scout, Ms. Yu Titi of Ningbo, and Ms. Yu Xiaojun of Shanghai Worker (originally scheduled for Mrs. Lu Jingshi, who did not arrive, so Miss Yu, the daughter of Secretary-General Yu, was invited to perform), each ascended the chair, raised champagne bottles, and smashed them against the nose of the plane. Aviation Department instructors Liu Chao and others had already boarded the planes separately, rotated the wheels, and took off one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e125">=Amazing Performance= <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After the bottle-breaking ceremony, the five planes were driven by Aviation School instructors Liu Chao, Hu Jiamei, Gao Zhihang, Wang Tianxiang, Chen Jiashang, and Chen Qixia to perform. The first to take off was the Ningbo plane, followed by each plane in order. Another Air Force plane of the same type also flew, making a total of six planes. They first circled the west side of the airfield once, then divided into teams of three, ascending into the air. At this time, the audience in the field formed a semi-circular shape, standing and looking up, with countless heads moving and applause resounding like thunder. At the same time, Sun Tonggang's Aviation Rescue plane also suddenly ascended into the sky amidst cheers to participate in the performance. The five planes performed a low-altitude V-formation for the first time, a low-altitude line formation for the second time, a 2,000-meter dive for the third time, and a 90-degree left turn for the fourth time. There were seven such continuous performances, and they circled the city once, reaching Wusong and other places. Each time there was an amazing performance, and the skills were so skilled that there was nothing left to be desired. At the most exciting moments, the audience waved their hats and cheered. Sun's performances were like a dragonfly skimming the water, or a swallow skimming the waves, or straight up to the clouds, soaring into the sky, or flying sideways, dangerously riding the wind. Finally, he did a somersault in the air like a pigeon. Every time Sun performed, he won a lot of applause from the audience out of sympathy.</p>

<p>After the six planes landed, Gao Zhihang drove the Shanghai plane to perform. Mr. Gao is from Liaoning, about thirty years old, and has served in the air force for a long time. His skills are very pure and not weaker than those of Colonel Doolittle of the United States. The audience cheered even more.</p>

<p>At 5:15 p.m., two companies, the Far East Aviation Company and others, each sent a pilot to join Louis Na and Mike, each driving a training plane, to ascend into the sky and perform the amazing technique of parachute jumping. After the two planes ascended into the sky, they circled the field for several weeks. Then, at 5:20 p.m., they circled to the northeast and went straight to the southwest. After ascending to more than 2,000 feet, Louis Na and Mike jumped down one after another. After about a hundred feet or so, the parachute opened in response to the wind, and the two slowly drifted down with the wind. At that time, the viewers praised endlessly. The two pilots remained in the air, driving the planes. After the parachutes landed, the two pilots threw down smaller parachutes, and the viewers initially looked at them from afar, quite doubting that there were still people jumping down.</p>

<p>When the naming ceremony was completed, because there were too many people on the stage, the horizontal support under the temporarily built podium broke due to excessive pressure, and the stage collapsed as a result. Fortunately, the shock was not great, and the people on the stage were still able to stand. However, when sitting down, it slightly tilted to the right, causing a slight leg injury to Nan Huitang, a member of the music team. After being bandaged by the rescue team, he acted as usual.</p>

The Chinese Seafarers' Union specially sent representatives Feng Yuming, Tang Mingzhao, Jiang Keni, and others to present Sun with a rectangular flag embroidered with the words "Aviation Saves the Nation." The Chinese Boy Scout Corps regards the American Boy Scout leader as the aviator Lindbergh. Yesterday, the corps specially requested Sun to serve as the leader of the Chinese Boy Scout Corps. Sun immediately expressed his acceptance and changed into a Boy Scout uniform, taking a photo on the plane as a souvenir.</p>

<p>It is Incorrect that the Government Reorganization Will Have Wang as Chairman</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, along with Kong Xiangxi and others, returned to Shanghai from Xun on the Zhongshan warship the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning at 9:30, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence. At around 10:00, he drove to visit Huang Fu, the Chairman of the Reorganization Committee in Beiping of the Executive Yuan, to discuss the financial problems of North China. Mr. Song plans to stay in Shanghai for a week and then enter Beijing. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e140">Use of the Cotton and Wheat Loan <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:30, Mr. Song met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence. According to Mr. Song, the main issue of the Lushan Conference was the allocation of the American Cotton and Wheat Loan. It has been resolved that all of it will be used for construction projects and will not be used for military or political items. It has also been agreed that the National Economic Council will be responsible for supervision and management. At the same time, it was decided to expand the organization of the Economic Council and nominate President Wang (Jingwei), President Sun (Ke), and myself (Mr. Song) as standing committee members.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Government Reorganization is Incorrect <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that the most important issue discussed at the Lushan Conference was the reorganization of the National Government, and that President Wang would be appointed Chairman of the National Government and I would be the President of the Executive Yuan. Based on the facts, all of this is unfounded. The issue of government reorganization was not only not discussed at the Lushan Conference, but there is no need to reorganize. The authorities have not made such an expression, and the ministers of each Yuan will not be changed.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Song Has No Comment on Diplomacy <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>When reporters continued to ask whether diplomatic issues had been discussed and decided at the Lushan Conference, Mr. Song replied that he had no opinions on diplomatic issues and could not comment. He also said that he was not in a position to comment on whether the issue had been discussed at the Lushan Conference and what decisions had been made. As for the issue of convening the Fifth Plenary Session, whether it will be held at that time will be discussed at the next Central Standing Committee meeting. President Wang will release a statement on this matter within the day.</p>

<p>Regarding financial issues, after returning to the country, I borrowed 12 million yuan from the banking community in this city because the national tax revenue was insufficient. As for the financial problems of North China, they were also discussed and it was decided to reorganize them, and to dismiss those in North China political affairs who were ineffective, so that the administrative work for the reconstruction of the war zone could achieve better results.</p>

<p>The Shanghai North Station of the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways was destroyed and dismantled during the January 28 Incident last year. It was originally intended to be repaired and used immediately, but the process was suspended due to the Shanghai Municipal Government's proposal to relocate the station. In March of this year, the Ministry of Railways decided to abandon the relocation due to the severity of the national crisis. Instead, it decided to greatly repair the lower floor of the building and rebuild a portion of the upper floor, so that the Traffic Department could move in to work and passengers could wait for the train. After the approval of the Ministry of Railways, the project was contracted to the Zhongnan Construction Company for a total price of more than 50,000 yuan. Construction began in mid-May and lasted for more than three months. On August 31, the Ministry of Railways sent Commissioner Huang to officially inspect and accept the work. The Inquiry Office, Reception Office, and passenger waiting rooms of all classes have been completely restored, and the Traffic Department has also moved in to work. At the same time, the surroundings of the North Station have been decorated. The Administration Bureau has scheduled a flag-raising and opening ceremony for today (September 10) at 2:00 p.m. The Executive Yuan will send Chu Minyi and the Ministry of Railways will send Director Yu Yan of the Business Department to attend. From 3:00 to 9:00 p.m., journalists and leaders from all industries will be invited to visit, and tea and refreshments will be provided. Director Huang Boqiao will report on the repair process. The designated receptionists were convened by Chief Wang Zhigang yesterday morning at 10:00 to discuss and determine the division of labor, and a souvenir booklet for the repair of the North Station was printed and distributed to the guests by the receptionists on a temporary basis to provide explanations.</p>

The factory owners have suffered heavy losses due to the workers' repeated strikes, so the Xiangyuan and five other factories in the concession area, as well as the Chuxin and 23 other factories in the Xinza district, have all suspended operations, and have decided to continue suspending operations today. The details are as follows: Temporary Suspension of Operations After workers at Yuansheng on Yutong Road mistakenly identified a list of ritual offerings as a wage table the day before yesterday, it led to another strike, which gradually spread to 18 other factories on Chang'an Road, Guangfu Road, Meiyuan Road, and Hengfeng Road. Fortunately, the striking workers were dispersed by police officers from the four district police stations, so the Chuxin, Maofeng, and Fuxing factories were spared. Yesterday morning, the 23 silk factories in the district jointly refrained from sounding their whistles and implemented a work stoppage. Reasons for the Work Stoppage Xinsheng Agency reporters went to various factories yesterday to investigate and found that the reasons for the work stoppage were as follows: (1) sluggish silk sales; (2) drastic drop in silk prices; (3) the daily operation is, in fact, a helpless hardship; (4) if workers can work with peace of mind, the factories will do their best to maintain operations; (5) workers resume work in the morning and then strike again in the afternoon, resulting in heavy losses; (6) if this is ignored, foreign workers will launch an attack, so it is better to suspend operations; (7) if the workers can work, they will decide to resume operations, but at this time when the workers are indecisive, they have decided to suspend operations. Concessions Also Suspend Operations As for the Xiangyuan on Gansu Road, Yuan He Tai Ji on Arabassi Road, Taixin, Jingwei, and Yuyuan and five other factories on Guochen Road in the concession area, they were originally scheduled to resume work yesterday, but in view of the fact that the factories in the Minbei Xinza district had not resumed work and feared that the Zhabei workers would involve them in a strike again, they all did not resume operations yesterday. Today is a weekly holiday, and they will also stop work. Union Statement According to Yang Shumei and Yang Gengti, executive directors of the Third and Sixth District Silk Workers' Unions, they told Xinsheng Agency reporters yesterday that the union's intention was to advise all affiliated workers to resume work this morning to avoid protracted disputes. However, the factory owners questioned in a peculiar tone, asking whether the union could guarantee that there would be no more strikes after the workers resumed work. Because the factory owners have suffered heavy losses, the union cannot bear the heavy responsibility. Now that the factories are advocating a temporary suspension of operations, the union is powerless and can only ask the authorities to find a way to deal with it. Commander Dai Has Gone to Nankou from Peiping Inspecting Old Battlefields and Touring the Great Wall Yesterday, according to news from the Longhua Garrison Headquarters, Commander Dai left Peiping on the 8th to inspect the old battlefields of Nankou and toured the Great Wall at Juyongguan and Badaling. He plans to take the Ping Sui Railway to Chahar, Suiyuan, Baotou, and other places for a tour, inspecting the situation outside the Great Wall, and then return to Peiping to return south.

Exported Tobacco Leaves Can Get Back Half of the Original Special Tax The tobacco leaves produced in our country's Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and other provinces are very large in quantity. The tax rates levied have always been administered by the provinces themselves, and the tax rules are heavy, causing hardship for merchants and the people. Since July 1, when the Ministry of Finance ordered reforms, outsiders have generally not been aware of the underlying reasons. Yesterday, the reporter made a special trip to visit Mr. Ding Zhenbo, a standing committee member of the Tobacco Leaf Industry Guild, and asked him for details. Mr. Ding said that regarding the method of collecting tobacco taxes, in the past, stamp duty and alcohol tax were paid in the place of origin, and the rules differed from province to province. For example, Zhejiang Province levied 2.25 yuan per Customs catty every morning, and an additional public sales fee of 0.8 to 2.2 yuan was levied, averaging 1.56 yuan, for a total levy of about 4 yuan. If transported to other provinces, another half of the public sales fee had to be levied at the destination. Such multiple levies on the same item were not only a heavy burden but also caused sluggish sales and losses for merchants. Since the Ministry of Finance ordered the Tax Administration to implement reforms last month, a special tax has been collected at the place of origin at a rate of 4.15 yuan per 100 market catties, equivalent to 5.02 yuan per 100 Customs catties. Transportation and sales to the seven provinces of Fujian, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are generally not subject to repeated levies. Initially, the industry opposed this because the tax rules were heavier than before, and they felt unable to bear the burden during this time of declining tobacco sales. The reporter repeatedly requested a reduction from the Tax Administration, which repeatedly explained in detail that although the tax rules were slightly increased compared to before, they could be sold in seven provinces without repeated levies. After careful consideration, the actual difference was not great, and sales would be much more convenient. Later, the guild continued to petition that if the tobacco was transported and sold outside the seven provinces and abroad, it should be exempted from tax to facilitate sales and expand foreign trade. After the Tax Administration forwarded the petition to the Ministry of Finance for approval, all domestic tobacco, whether sun-cured or smoked, could receive a full refund of the original special tax or consolidated tax from the Tax Administration upon presentation of customs export documents. If domestic tobacco is transported to areas outside the seven provinces, half of the original special tax can also be refunded from the Tax Administration upon presentation of customs tax receipts. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and prices are plummeting, Commissioner Xie is considerate of the plight of farmers and businesses and has petitioned on their behalf, allowing our country's domestic products to be sold abroad tax-free. This is part of the government's plan to revitalize the domestic economy and a new initiative to care for the people. The Shanghai Municipal Council Welcomes Bei Songsun's Return to Office Bei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China, accompanied Finance Minister Song Ziwen to attend the World Economic Conference.

Because Bei also served as a Chinese director, he took leave to attend. The chairman, Pei Er, on behalf of all the directors, delivered a speech welcoming Bei's return to office. Notice from the Cholera Prevention Office No. 3 Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office Notice No. 3: The Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office issued its third announcement on September 9, stating: (1) Since the last announcement, it has been five weeks, and there have been no cholera cases in Shanghai. According to past experience, Shanghai has never had a cholera outbreak starting in September, so this year can be called cholera-free. The same situation occurred in 1918. (2) Health agencies across the country are better prepared for cholera prevention than in previous years. However, on July 24, there was a male patient in Wuchang, and on September 5, there was a female patient in Hankou. Both cases were tested and confirmed to be cholera, and both have now recovered. (3) There are many cases of gastroenteritis, dysentery, and typhoid fever in this city and other cities. The cause is unclean drinking water taken from ponds or shallow wells. If there were clean drinking water facilities, most of these cases could be avoided. (4) There are still more than 20 epidemic hospitals in Shanghai, as in previous years, with medical personnel and equipment for cholera treatment. This year, because there have been no true cholera cases, there is little work to do. Most hospitals will close in mid-September. (5) The work of the two subcommittees of this office has been quite successful. The Epidemiology Research Society has tested and checked cholera bacteria and water quality from the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek, Yangshupu, Xujiahui, Hongkou Creek, and various shallow wells. Because poor people nearby still use this kind of water for drinking, the inspection results did not find cholera vibrio, but there are non-pathogenic vibrio in the water in various places. Four types have now been identified. This work will continue to be studied this year. The Propaganda Committee has prepared to expand propaganda methods based on the past three years of experience. Once cholera occurs, propaganda will be carried out according to this procedure to achieve the purpose of controlling the epidemic. Weather conditions are also related to the occurrence of cholera. In order to study this issue, meteorological reports on Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Xiamen, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Qingdao have been obtained from the Hong Kong Observatory, Xujiahui Observatory, Guangzhou Zhongshan University Observatory, and Customs Patrol Service. When the temperature is too high, the absolute humidity also increases. When the absolute humidity is as high as 0.4 inches, the epidemic will spread, so the cholera epidemic is related to absolute humidity. However, an increase in humidity is not a precursor to the spread of the epidemic. (6) Preventive injections were still carried out in August as before. From September to the end of July, a total of 165,769,379,696,543,465 people were vaccinated in Shanghai, 55,698,186,371,242,069 people in the public concession, and 16,367,615,127,787,2 people in the French concession. With this result when there is no cholera epidemic, it can be seen that people at all levels of society have great faith in the measures of the health authorities. If there are other epidemics, they can also proceed accordingly. (7) The weather in summer is dry and hot. There was no rain in July, and it only rained after August 12. Although residents drink a lot of raw water and watermelon, there has been no cholera outbreak. If residents can pay attention to eating clean melon fruits and drinking tap water as boiled water, most cholera and other gastrointestinal diseases can be eradicated. The main task of cholera prevention is to establish tap water in various parts of the country, and the people will welcome this kind of clean drinking water to replace the foul-smelling water. (8) If the health authorities can provide clean drinking water, free injections, hospital treatment, and feces disposal, cholera will not be difficult to eradicate in Shanghai. Taiwan, Java, Kota, Singapore, and other places were once cholera-prone areas, but now there is no cholera. This can be used as a reference. (9) If there are no other incidents, this will be the last announcement of the year, and I am deeply grateful to the relevant authorities and health agencies, testing institutes, observatories, etc. in the concession and Shanghai for their assistance. This year, a Chinese and English booklet will be published on cholera symptoms and prevention methods for the reference of all sectors of society.

<p>On the Essence of Free Will vs. Determinism, by Qifan</p>
<p>Chinese people are, by and large, determinists. Most believe that one's fortunes, longevity, and destiny are predetermined by one's birth chart (八字). Fortune tellers even use the calculation of these charts to make a living, while also explaining the inevitable reasons why the rich are rich, the poor are poor, and the powerful are powerful. This principle is beyond doubt and can never be wrong. It is the destiny assigned by the Creator at the time of one's birth, decreeing that one will starve to death, even with copper mountains like Deng Tong; that even an emperor like Emperor Wu of Liang cannot avoid it; and that one will soar to great heights, even if one was once a small novice monk selling himself in a temple like Zhu Yuanzhang, who became an emperor.</p>
<p>If a person's circumstances are good, it is because their destiny dictates it. If a person becomes a high-ranking official, it is because their destiny dictates it. If a person is poor, it is due to their bad fate. If a person is beheaded, it is also their destiny. Everything is predetermined by the Creator. The wealth of the rich, the blessings of the fortunate, and the suffering of the miserable are all predetermined, as they should be and must be. Therefore, while wine and meat rot behind red doors, and there are corpses by the roadside, one can only view it as a difference in fate, a contrast between the blessings of the fortunate and the suffering of the miserable, and one cannot seek any connection between them. If one thinks about issues of distribution, wanting to give the uneaten meat and wine to the starving, it is divinely forbidden.</p>
<p>The recent widespread advocacy for rescuing the decline of Chinese rural villages is nothing more than the heavenly mandate for the suffering people in rural areas to suffer even more because they only have the fate of suffering, and they can never improve no matter what. Under such a heaven-ordained organization and distribution method, even if industry were to be revitalized a hundredfold, the suffering would still suffer, and perhaps suffer even more miserably. If one thinks that having enough resources for everyone to eat and use means that everyone can eat when there is enough, then shouldn't it also mean that everyone should eat less when there is not enough? Why did Mencius have to say, "In the kitchen there is fat meat, in the stable there are fat horses, yet on the road there are starved corpses, and the people have famine in their faces?"</p>
<p>The essence is very refined: those who can enjoy blessings can enjoy blessings everywhere, and those who are destined to suffer can only suffer everywhere. Before the theory of determinism is broken down, all forms of relief, revitalization, and reform are futile. Because under this established theory of determinism, these methods can never reverse the situation to make the suffering enjoy blessings and the blessed suffer, but will only continue to make the blessed enjoy more blessings and the suffering suffer more. Here, I realized that the "fate" in "revolution" is the same as the "fate" in "determinism." It seems that the revolution has already succeeded, but seeing the large number of fortune tellers still in business now makes me feel very strange.</p>
<h3 id="e152">"Take Off the Hair on My Face" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Gechuan, in a recent "Free Talk," stated that I fabricated evidence in my criticism of Basic English, claiming that the examples from certain pages of the book "Carlo and Anna" (Carland Anna) that I cited were not found in the book (I don't have the original text at hand, but that's the gist). The page numbers I based on were from Ogden's original work, "A Basic Vocabulary," and if there were errors in the page numbers, Ogden should be responsible. It's likely a different edition. Now, I will again refer to the 1930 edition of "Carlo and Anna" (translated by L.W. Lockhart, published by Kegan Paul in London, with a preface by Ogden), specifying the page numbers to prove that my words are not false, and also attach a few strange new discoveries. Mr. Qian says it's not there; I say it is. If it cannot be resolved in the future, we will have to ask Mr. Li Liewen to treat us to a meal to settle this case.</p>
<p>The examples I pointed out in the original text (The Analects, Issue 22), totaling five, are all here.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the phonograph: "a polished black circle, with a picture of a dog in front of a horn, was playing a piece of military music" (pages 51, lines 8-10).</p>
<p>(2) Regarding beard: Not only is there no word for "beard," there is not even a word for "shave." Therefore, there is a passage saying that when Carlo was in prison, he "taken the hair off his face every Saturday" (page 28, last line). "Hair on the face" is also seen on page 18, line 7 ("the hair on his face was long and untended"); page 58, line 11 ("the shopkeeper once had black hair on his upper lip"); page 29, lines 2-4 ("If you didn't have hair on your face before, and after these years you have hair, go see her...")</p>
<p>(3) Regarding nipple: "Her milk vessels, which were surprisingly young, were white and small and had a mellow sky blue markings" (Forgive my direct translation, because the original text is already awkward; "markings" likely refers to "blue veins") (pages 72, second to fourth lines from the bottom).</p>
<p>In another passage, the original book uses "nipple," but Basic English does not use "milk vessels" but uses "upper part of her body": "The question I frequently put to myself is Why is that the upper part of her body is so white and the rest of her body and her legs a so much deeper colour?" (page 18, lines 12-16).</p>
<p>(4) Regarding fantasy: The most burning thought picture (page 31). Regarding this passage, see below.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding onion: "White root that brings tears to the eyes": This example is Ogden's own explanation of the method of circumlocution (see his book "A Basic Vocabulary," page 83).</p>
<p>In addition, I also discovered five incomprehensible and ridiculous sentences in the book "Carlo and Anna." Assuming these sentences were not in "Basic English" but were found in a student's essay, the teacher would definitely criticize them as incomprehensible without hesitation.</p>
<p>(A) "The weight of his stomach did not go." The original text and surrounding sentences are as follows: Richard had made a picture of the design for him. The weight of his stomach did not go. He had an impulse to go and come back easier (page 30, lines 10-14). At first glance, it's completely incomprehensible. Later, I discovered that a sentence in the previous paragraph said that Carlo had a certain "thought picture which seemed a weight on his stomach" (same page, line 2).</p>
<p>(B) "The weight of her body was pulled down": The preceding text is about Anna going upstairs to buy meat, but she didn't have enough money and was pondering how to buy enough for both of them to eat. Following that is (awkwardly, according to the original text): "Thought was necessary. Feeling gave place to thought. The weight of her body was pulled down. Her head came up clear and free" (Judging from the situation, it seems to say that she bent over slightly, then seemed to have an idea and raised her head again). Thought was necessary. Feeling gave place to thought. The weight of her body was pulled down. Her head came up clear and free (page 55, lines 10-14).</p>
<p>(C) Take lips: "And when lifting his eyes he saw her lips open waiting for him and took them again no word was said" (page 48, lines 16-19). The phrase "take lips" seems to mean "kiss," but why not use "kiss" when it is in the 850 words? It is unknown whether it is not allowed to use "kiss" as a verb with the past tense suffix "ed."</p>
<p>(D) "His pleasure was in his eyes": This sentence is a bit like broken Chinese spoken by foreigners. His pleasure was in his eyes (page 22, line 1).</p>
<p>(E) "Sometimes the memory of her goes completely": This is an example of circumlocution. Because there is no word for "forget" in the 850 words, this method of circumlocution is used. Sometimes the memory of her goes completely (page 19, lines 2-3).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I hate this kind of writing, whether it's in Chinese or Western languages. Please take the following passage as a representative example:</p>
<p>"And it became clear to him that the most burning thought picture is not equal to a breathing moving living human being the changes of whose face through the blood have a connection with the living heart and are them selves a part of living The form of a human being has separate existence its motion goes through space cutting through" (page 30, end of the passage).</p>
<p>Enough, enough, writers of today are almost finished. Not only can the hair on the face be taken, but even the lips can be taken. In Basic English, which uses eighteen verbs to express all actions in the world, the use of the word "take" is truly vast.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Lifebuoy <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Posthumous Work of Peng Jiahuang</p>
<p>Two people camped out in a village. The one with a gram of luck, not caring about anything, lay in the middle of the road. The one with a ton of wisdom, afraid of being run over by carriages, lay by the side of the road. Late at night, a carriage came. The two horses, seeing the dark figure in the middle of the road, jumped to the side in fright, instead running over the person with a ton of wisdom. A Romanian proverb says:</p>
<p>"One gram of luck is better than a cartload of wisdom."</p>
<p>A certain newspaper recently published an "interesting story," a "pathetic howl": Xu Mingfu of Jiaxing, unemployed for a long time, extremely bored, wandered back and forth along the Huangpu River. At the wharf, he broke a glass cabinet set up by the roadside, took out a lifebuoy, and was arrested and sent to court. The court, believing that he "misunderstood" the meaning of the word, violated the criminal law and sentenced him to ten days of detention, suspended for two years. After the sentence was pronounced, he was dismissed.</p>
<p>In the world, people often find life in death. Like an ostrich that doesn't resist, burying its head in the sand to avoid death, it can't escape death in the end. If a person is still "alive" on the shore and takes a lifebuoy meant for drowning, they are clearly joking with the lifebuoy. Lifebuoys don't care about the lives of people on shore. Only if you want to die in the water will it prevent you from dying.</p>
<p>If Xu Mingfu were truly unafraid of death and jumped into the Huangpu River, perhaps the lifebuoy would be around his neck and he would be saved. If the court had been strict and truly sentenced him to ten days of detention without suspending it for two years, he would at least be saved for those ten days. "After the sentence was pronounced, he was dismissed." The future is vast and uncertain, neither dead nor alive. Where will he go?</p>
<p>People should still rely on a gram of luck and lie in the middle of the road!</p>

<p>He Ru</p>
<p>He was worthy of his poor friends,</p>
<p>He was someone who had also gone hungry.</p>
<p>He was worthy of the brave warriors,</p>
<p>He was someone who had also been in prison.</p>
<p>He left behind many readable words,</p>
<p>Yet he never boasted of being a genius.</p>
<p>He participated in many human endeavors,</p>
<p>Yet he was never called a talented person.</p>
<p>He sold much mental labor,</p>
<p>Yet he never sold his own personality.</p>
<p>He was a person who had gone hungry,</p>
<p>He can say goodbye to his poor friends.</p>
<p>He was a person who had been in prison,</p>
<p>He can say goodbye to the brave warriors.</p>
<p>Women (17)</p>
<p>Shen Congwen</p>
<p>The woman said with a smile:</p>
<p>"If you don't love, I will understand without you saying it. Love can also be expressed without words."</p>
<p>The man said:</p>
<p>"Are you still angry with me?"</p>
<p>The woman said:</p>
<p>"What am I angry with you about? What's the point of being angry?"</p>
<p>Later, the two had dinner under the kerosene lamp. After dinner, the woman, as instructed by the doctor, mixed two kinds of medicine into a small bottle, gently shook it for a while, and then poured it into a white porcelain cup.</p>
<p>After taking the medicine, the man lay on the bed, and the woman sat beside the bed, talking to him about everything in the past. When the two talked about the misunderstanding when they separated at the beach in the past, the man said to the woman:</p>
<p>"… Didn't you say you'd give me another chance to prove what kind of person you are? I ask you, what kind of chance is it?"</p>
<p>The woman didn't say anything, stood up for a moment, then sat down again, and pressed her face close to the man's face. The man only felt intoxicated by the fragrance, as if he had never smelled this kind of fragrance before.</p>
<p>The next morning, at about eight o'clock, when the man woke up, the woman was not in the room. There was a small envelope beside the pillow. The outside was not addressed, but he knew that there was a letter inside the white envelope when he touched it. He tore off the paper of the envelope, and sure enough, there was a piece of white paper with writing on it. The letter read:</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I always feel it's better to leave. For my happiness, for not wronging my own feelings, I left. Don't think about any past pain. Since the past has become the past, it's not worth putting your feelings on it to be tormented. You never understood me in the first place. What I hoped for, and have experienced all the pain for this wish for years, was just for you to understand me. Now that you have understood me and loved me, in order to explain our lives more beautifully, it is better for me to leave than for me to live with you.</p>
<p>Your medicine is already prepared on the table. Take it properly according to the doctor's instructions, and then sleep quietly. Learn to be a man, learn to be the kind of man you usually think of yourself as, don't be alarmed, don't let the hotel know anything. I hope you can be as usual, don't worry about me. I didn't leave to increase your longing for me. I just feel that our affair has come to a conclusion, I should leave, so I left.</p>
<p>May God bless you. Ruliu</p>
<p>After reading the letter, he quickly pressed the electric bell by the bed. When the bellboy came, he was still clutching the letter in his hand, lying in bed. He originally wanted to ask the bellboy when the woman who shared the room went down the mountain, but when he saw the bellboy, he didn't say a word, just motioned with his head for him to leave. After the bellboy closed the door and left, he reached out to grab the medicine bottle. The white liquid in the medicine bottle gave off small bubbles when shaken.</p>
<p>He watched these bubbles disappear after being shaken and then stopping, and continued to shake it. He loved her, and felt that he truly loved her. (End)</p>

<p>After a steamship arrives in Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs routinely sends inspectors aboard to check for smuggled prohibited items and contraband military arms. Customs officers, as it is their duty, conduct strict inspections. On the "Green Hogland" steamship, customs officers discovered a large quantity of military arms in the fire hold. It is reported that there were thirty-nine automatic modern firearms and thirty-nine boxes of ammunition for these firearms, totaling four thousand rounds. The military arms were generally loaded in Europe for Shanghai, hoping to be offloaded in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, they were seized by customs.</p>

<p>When customs inspectors discovered these military arms, they immediately transferred all the firearms and ammunition to a small customs launch, brought them back to customs, and reported to the Tax Commissioner. Simultaneously, they began investigating the individuals involved in the smuggling. On-site investigation revealed a Chinese fireman in the ship's fire hold as highly suspicious. Customs officers brought him to customs for questioning to investigate the origin of the arms. Yesterday, it was also reported that two crew members were summoned by customs for questioning. The specifics of the situation are difficult to fully ascertain. Yesterday, the ship owner reported the matter to the Shanghai shipping authorities. It is said that these military arms were smuggled by crew members and are not directly related to the company or the ship.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Art Exhibition for the Yellow River Flood, organized by the general manager Shao Ruyu and others over the past few days, is now ready. It is scheduled to open tomorrow (the 11th) at the Great World and will run for three days until the 13th. Prior approval was obtained from the French Municipal Council, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and other relevant authorities. Additionally, Qiu Wanrong, Min Caizhang, Wang Wenkui, Ding Yongchang, and twenty other individuals were appointed as directors to separately invite renowned performers such as Zhao Ruquan, Lin Shusen, Jia Biyun, and others to perform dramas. Furthermore, the local flower industry was enlisted to hold a joint variety show at the ice rink, featuring song performances, and thirty prominent local couples were invited to a costume ball, dressed as "Hemp Fairy" and "Old Man Longevity," and to participate in a blindfolded dance. A seven-story yellow archway has been erected at the entrance of the Great World, and the interior of each section is decorated with yellow backdrops, creating a spectacular scene. Ticket prices remain the same, and no additional donations will be solicited from visitors. It is reported that, to commend the individuals who have enthusiastically participated in the performances, the organizers plan to request Secretary-General Chu Minyi of the Executive Yuan, after the art exhibition concludes, to seek a way to have the Executive Yuan issue awards to each participant to encourage future participation.</p>

<p>The preparatory work for the China Calcium Carbide Factory has been underway for more than a month. The initiators, Huang Yanfang, Yu Zuoting, Jin Tingsun, Shi Zhikun, Xue Runsheng, Wu Guochang, and others, are all highly respected figures of the time. Calcium carbide (Calcium Carbide) plays an important role in industry. It is an essential raw material for welding steel components, manufacturing acetic acid, rayon, nitrogen fertilizer, aircraft lacquer, and military explosives. Therefore, all countries consider calcium carbide a key national defense item. Recently, electrical and chemical engineer Shi Yunchang has prepared electrical equipment and conducted careful experiments, achieving remarkable results. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a public experiment was held on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai. Guests from all walks of life arrived in a continuous stream. Mr. Shi arranged the equipment and carried out the production of a small amount of calcium carbide. After about an hour, it was completely successful. He then tested the self-made calcium carbide and imported first-class products using the same amount. The gas produced (i.e., calcium carbide gas) showed that imported products could produce 290 cc of gas per gram of calcium carbide, while domestically produced calcium carbide produced 450 cc of gas, which is superior to imported products. Spectators expressed their admiration. The future success of the factory will greatly benefit China's military and industrial prospects.</p>

<p>Join Hands in Charity to Benefit Flood Victims</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Charity Organizations for Emergency Relief of the Yellow River Flood received a communication yesterday from Mr. Bu of the Shanghai Charity Art Exhibition for the Yellow River Flood stating that the flood in the Yellow River basin is extremely severe and that emergency relief cannot be delayed. Therefore, a charity art exhibition is being held to broadly promote the sale of charity show tickets. The association sent separate letters to all sectors yesterday, which stated, "Respected Sir/Madam, we have received a communication from Mr. Shao Ruxin of the Shanghai Charity Art Exhibition for the Yellow River Flood stating that the flood in the Yellow River basin is extremely severe and that emergency relief cannot be delayed. After consulting with Mr. Huang Jinrong, it has been decided that a charity art exhibition will be held at the Great World for three days on September 11, 12, and 13. All proceeds from ticket sales will be handed over to this association for distribution. However, as the exhibition is imminent, and it will be difficult to succeed without concerted efforts and widespread promotion, we are sending 10,000 charity show tickets, priced at one yuan each, and request that you make every effort to distribute them so that fundraising can be achieved. Additionally, we are sending 10,000 general admission tickets valid for all three venues. We have long admired your concern for those suffering from hunger and drowning and your extensive social connections. We are sending a number of these entrance tickets and request that you consider the severity of the disaster, graciously accept them, and distribute them to your relatives and friends to join hands in charity and benefit the flood victims. What is spent is not much, but it provides both entertainment and relief from suffering, achieving two goals in one stroke, and the merit is immeasurable."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court confiscated opium, red pills, morphine, heroin, and other drugs seized by the French Concession Police, as well as equipment for manufacturing morphine and red pills and evidence from gambling cases, from April to the end of June of this year. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM was the time set for the seventh burning of these items. Prior to this, the court president Ying Shi and Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan reported to the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Third High Court branch and invited representatives from military, political, police, judicial, and drug resistance organizations, the bar association, and other groups in Shanghai to supervise the event. Yesterday morning, the head of the confiscated goods department ordered bailiffs to move the various drugs and gambling evidence to the open space next to the east side of the court, where they were arranged in numbered order. Shen Xiqing, president of the Shanghai Local Court, dispatched by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, arrived to supervise the event. At 1:30 PM, Mr. Shen's representative and representatives from various organizations arrived one after another. They were greeted and seated by Court President Ying, Chief Chen, and Chief Clerk Xiao Jinfang. Subsequently, court officials supervised the bailiffs in moving the drugs in front of each representative, opening them for inspection, weighing them, and then carrying them to the center of the yard, where they were placed on firewood and doused with kerosene and salt before being set on fire. After the drugs were burned, the gambling paraphernalia was burned next, and the event concluded by dusk. The representatives then departed. This time, a total of 268 opium pipes, 1,955 pill pipes, 1,470 red pill smoking pipes, 146 packages of opium of various sizes, and hundreds of pounds of red pill powder in bags, tins, and packages, 751 opium bubbles, and countless morphine and heroin manufacturing equipment, 5,893 gambling paraphernalia Huahui paper cards, 38 stacks and 2 packages and 1 box, one bank passbook, 9 domino sets, 10 mahjong sets, 33 dice, and other items such as coin boards, shaking cylinders, and chips were destroyed.</p>

<p>The Xin Renhe steamship of the Yu Xing Company in Nanshi has been suspended for many days since the tragic incident. The directors of the Yu Xing Company, facing economic difficulties, have leased the ship to the Haiqi Shipping Bureau for operation, sailing on the original route. It resumed service yesterday, departing from Shanghai. At about 5 PM, when it was raising anchor at Pier No. 5 in Nanshi, suddenly four or five beggar-like women boarded the ship, causing disturbances, bumping into people, tearing at things, and shouting loudly. When questioned, they claimed to be family members of the victims, but stared blankly and did not answer. After being driven away by the water police, they forcibly left the ship and then rushed into the Haiqi Shipping Bureau's office, behaving in the same manner. The First District Public Security Bureau dispatched a patrol officer to the bureau, who dragged the women out. The women claimed they would return tomorrow and then dispersed. During the disturbance, an onlooker noticed that the women seemed to be neither crying nor laughing and, upon closer inspection, realized that they were not the same people who had stood in the plaintiff's position at the opening of the court hearing at the local court the day before.</p>

<p>Accountant Shen Liren is a knowledgeable and experienced accounting expert, one of the few in the country. After returning from France ten years ago, he has been practicing accounting in Shanghai, providing thorough procedures and dedicated service, which is highly trusted by society. Recognizing the lack of accounting talent in the country, he has focused on education, independently establishing the China Correspondence School of Accounting to cultivate specialized accounting talents and meet the needs of industry and commerce. At the same time, he has also served as a professor at various universities in Shanghai. Over the years, he has educated no less than ten thousand people, earning him fame and respect in all walks of life. However, due to his busy teaching schedule, he has not been able to focus on accounting services. Now that the domestic accounting system is gradually improving and accounting services are becoming increasingly complex, with numerous industrial and commercial enterprises seeking his services daily, Mr. Shen has decided to hire assistants and expand his practice. It is reported that since the government mandated company registration, the number of related service requests has been overwhelming.</p>

<p>The two criminals in the box corpse case, Baderiele Midiao and his accomplice Qiusi Fule Midiao, were sentenced by the Portuguese Consul-General to be extradited to Macau for formal court questioning. Yesterday, as the extradition date had arrived, the Portuguese Consulate-General purchased passenger seats on the French postal ship "Fanmier Luosuo" in advance. As the ship was scheduled to depart yesterday morning, the two criminals were taken from the Xiamen Road Western Prison by detectives from the Public Security Bureau in a car and transported to the North Bund Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hongkou. Chief Detective Williams of the Public Security Bureau Western Division and detectives Wheeler and Cook also accompanied the two criminals, boarding the postal ship at about 10 AM. The detectives kept close watch on the criminals, escorting them to their designated cabins.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Consulate in Shanghai selected the most important items from the various pieces of evidence in the box corpse case and sent them to Macau yesterday with escorts dispatched by the consulate to be used by the court for reference. After the two criminals boarded the ship, the French postal ship departed from Shanghai at 11 AM. It will first go to Hong Kong and then transfer to Macau. The French ship is very fast and can arrive in about two days, estimated to reach Macau on the 12th.</p>

<p>Regarding the testimony of witnesses in this case, because there are many people and the court records are very long and complex, they need to be organized. There is not enough time to take them to Macau now. It is also heard that when the official trial of the two criminals begins in Macau, the Portuguese Consulate in Shanghai will have to summon the witnesses in the case again to the consulate for questioning to compare their testimonies with those of the two criminals. Therefore, the official verdict and charges in this case are likely to be issued a month later. The reporter also learned that Portuguese Consul-General Dr. Xue Erfo, due to the box corpse case and other important official matters, needs to consult with the domestic authorities in Macau and also took this ship to Hong Kong and then transferred to Macau.</p>

<p>Accused of Privately Selling Drugs and Transporting Japanese Goods as a Traitor</p>
<p>Arrested by the Public Security Bureau and Sent to Court for Investigation and Further Interrogation</p>
<p>A Chinese detective from the Central Public Security Bureau, number 221, discovered an abandoned printed item on yellow paper with black characters on Jiangxi Road a few days ago. The text reads, "Respected Sir/Madam, I was pleased to read in the newspaper that the traitor Hu Lifu has been executed. However, there are famous and not-so-famous traitors. Famous traitors act as accomplices for tigers and harm their compatriots, like Hu Lifu. Not-so-famous traitors privately sell Japanese goods and seek only their own benefit. Such people are countless. Now, I will mention the important ones for the sake of my compatriots. It is discovered that Feng Laosi, also known as Feng Renshou, and his brother Feng Laowu, Shandong natives residing at Gao Li in the British Concession,</p>
<h3 id="e170">Were Bandits at Home <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Were arrested and fled to Shanghai. He initially served as a patrolman but was soon dismissed. Later, he became a railway policeman but was dismissed again for violating police regulations. He then became a gangster, opening a school to take in students. All the thieves, pickpockets, railway porters, and other lower-class people in Shanghai worship him as their teacher. Therefore, he is involved in receiving stolen goods and extortion, doing everything possible. Later, he used railway porters to transport opium and morphine to Suzhou and Changzhou for sale. Last month, he transported a total of three boxes of morphine, red pills, and heroin, each box containing 240,000 red pills, to Henan for sale. Unexpectedly, they were seized at the North Station by the special investigation team of the municipal government, Mr. Liu. Because Feng has many followers, they</p>

<p>Now, he has changed his strategy and is transporting morphine and other items to Luoyang, Shanzhou, and Kaifeng for sale, transporting millions every day. What is hateful is that since the boycott of Japanese goods in Shanghai, this Feng Laosi has opened a Fook Kee Transport Company in Gao Shou Li, acting as a traitor, specializing in transporting Japanese yarn, cloth, and other goods for the Japanese for sale, making a lot of profit. Later, due to strict inspections, he stopped operating. Now, he is still smuggling. This Feng family was originally poor and rogue, but now suddenly</p>
