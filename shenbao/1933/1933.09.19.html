<h3>各省市下半旗爲死難同胞誌哀</h3>
<p>（南京）中央十八日晨八時舉行九十六次紀念週、同時舉行（九一八）二週年紀念、到中央汪兆銘·戴傳賢·葉楚傖·居正·蔣作賓·陳果夫·邵元冲·陳公博·朱培德·賀耀組·朱家驊·丁超五·焦易堂·曾仲鳴等、曁中央工作人員各機闗代表、共六百餘人、汪主席、吳敬恒報告、略謂今天舉行總理紀念週、同時舉行九一八二週年紀念會、其意義之重大、諒大家都很明白、在兩年前的今天、日人以暴力襲擊我瀋陽、繼續攻佔我東北四省、這種種的暴行、至今還歷歷在我们眼前、這是普天同情的、今天我们舉行悲痛的國恥紀念會、再過些日子、我们的國慶日就要來了、這一天可以說是普天同歡的一天、老實說、我们的紀念日實在不少、自民國以來、闗於日本方面、便有（五三）（五七）（五九）這一類相似的紀念日、但是以前我们並没有什麽紀念日、自從中國外交失敗以來、從鴉片戰爭起、經過中東庚子之戰、以至九一八·一二八之戰、無一次不是我们失敗、也無一次不是使我们垂頭喪氣、在甲午年六月二十五日、日本在渤海中把我商船突然打沉、從此開釁、我们受了這一次重大打擊以後、到了兩年前的今天爲什麽還要受日本一次打擊呢就是因爲我们没有實行總理的意思、今天我们看一看掛在禮堂中那副對聯、上聯是發揚民族精神、下聯是充實國家力量、現在我们的民族精神、固已奮發了、可是充實國家的力量、這一點還不能做到、當時總理看到民族精神的奮發、固然是重要、而同時看到國家力量的充實、也是同樣的重要　所以總理在甲午前一年上書李鴻章、便有（一）地盡其利（二）物盡其用（三）貨暢其流的三句話、爲充實國力最緊要一個步驟、可是現在總理這三句話還是絲毫没有實行、因此大家都在那裹愁窮、全國農村都有破產的現象、更不能談到充實國力了、所以今天我们舉行紀念會、不在於悲壯熱烈的形式、而在我舉國人民從此同心戮力、本先烈堅苦卓絶的精神、努力實現總理的遺敎、以達到地盡其利·物盡其用·貨暢其流的目的、則國家力量必趨充實、國家力量充實而後、我们的恥辱必有洗雪的一天、（十八日中央明電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>提倡土布　實</h3>
<p>在洋氣充滿洋化十足之上海而提倡土布。竟具空前稀有之成績。土布展覽。能激動上海市民莫大之興奮。開會時之盛况與參觀之踴躍。匪特舉得本國工業界之嚴重注意。且足引起一般社會之興味。從此土布工業。或有逐漸發展之機。使我國次殖民地之經濟現狀。多得一更生之道。亦未可知也。夫土布之爲用。我國舊日農業經濟之理想主義者。莫不希望農村之自給自足。以爲治平之世。端在耕織。富裕之道。寓於自耕而食自織而衣之中。所謂家給人足是也。棉花之出產。雖受天氣與地質之制限。然以人民用力之勤。即中收亦足以敷用。且從前農家。莫不置有　車。冬令農閑。婦女從事於紡紗。春季暖和。則着手織布。設使政治上無過大之紛擾。天候上又無巨大之荒旱者。則農村雍睦之狀。誠無異於理想之烏托邦也。頃者。資本主義挾廉價商品渡海東來。機械製造物品。遂衝破我國農村之隄防。擊碎自給自足之幻夢。手工業社會組織。乃由此而根本動摇。且日即於崩壞。五十年來。我國即彷徨於此守旣不能進又不易之途中而無由自拔。雖然。此種情况。在我國前期資本主義之社會中。固感覺當前局勢之嚴重。而在今日資本主義達到濫熟之候。經濟恐慌深化之各國。其嚴重性又何嘗在中國下也。</p>
<p>自本年六月世界經濟會議召集以前。純粹的閉闗主義。已顯然碰壁。長此繼續不已。除自斃外絶無第二途徑。是以國際合作之說。又爲當世各國所重視。而主要各國。又皆盛望世界經濟會議能求得若干妥恊之點使世界經濟恐慌。得以緩和。現局得稍平衡然而國與國間之界限終不能泯民族間之惡感。依然熾烈。侵略抗抵之爭。仍加急前進於是世界經濟會議席上并此極抽象之原則而亦不能成。經濟的國民主義反而昻揚北美合衆國之產業復興計劃所謂（青鷲革命）運動即其一例。</p>
<p>（自給自足。）在昔日農業社會中元爲極度之閉闗保守政策其意義祇限於一家一族最大亦僅至於一國而止非如近日交通發達國與國之闗係由簡單而複雜欲圖絶對之閉闗鎖國任何國家皆不可能如我中國如蘇聯如美。如英。其所轄領地較廣人口較多天產亦較豐富。主要物品。或可不仰給於海外。然尙不能絶對的自足也且先進各國對於所謂經濟聯盟丨國家的自給自足之解釋并非不出售本國物產不購進海外製品乃竭力提倡輸出。而以全力防止外貨輸入是也其主旨所在固以經濟組織爲基幹惟目標則在於戰時之軍事準備。此種事態在一年半之前惟日本竭力行之今則英美皆急起直追。力圖此種政策之全部實現矣。</p>
<p>我國在農業社會之手工業文明誠屬先進但於近代社會組織帶有機械工業之自給自足主義則極缺乏素養欲在列國環伺之中打開經濟出路事實上必遇空前未有之難闗可斷言也然而吾人不觀今日之印度乎彼甘地手無寸鐵。身負紡車猶能運用其歷史的偉力。發揮個人之特長。以與英國統治相抗衡而謂我國提倡土布。反難於甘地耶不過吾人對倡用土布之舉。於農村固甚希冀其能收極大效果。而於工業區域。則應明白農村間紡紗業崩潰之形勢。惟有以機械紡紗供作織造土布之原料。故希望紡紗業界勿忽視此未來之廣大消路先悉力考察農村之需要及一般農民之好惡則一面可以解决紗業當前存貨不消之苦一面又可以在本國境内另闢新途徑於土布前程。更有莫大之助力也。</p>

<p>（東京）　廣田外相就任後、日本外交方針如何變更、頗爲内外各方面所注目、新外相努力外交全面的之發展、重建國際闗係、爲當然之事、然據其於就任後公式與非公式所發表之意見、略知外相對於中日闗係之發展、擬傾注其全力、即廣田鑒於中日兩國有特别闗係、認改善兩國闗係、爲不可猶豫之緊急問題、故其未就外相前、計畫單身赴中國、後因其就外相、此舉未能實現、然最先命亞洲局長作製對華外交政策之大網、聞其根本方針如下、對華外交自滿洲事件發生以來、採用靜觀主義、今日亦堅持旣定方針、然最近國聯與中國合作、其他英美諸國之對華活動漸次熾烈、日本爲自衛計、應抛棄靜觀主義、採用積極態度、而帝國政府對華新政策、不如舊時妥恊的政策或英美等以恩惠交換利權之所謂交易的外交、係使中國爲其本身利益與幸福、自動改變現在對日態度之政策、故新外相之對華政策、與歷代外相不同、可謂從來未見之更生的外交也、（十八日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）　編成明年度國防預算之際、大藏省鑒於國際情勢之推移、擬着重海軍預算、至陸軍預算中、如機材整備闗係項目、能速成者則擬延至後年度、陸軍對此則以下列理由絶對反對、即計上明年度預算之機材整備費二億元、係昭和九年度以降繼續費殘存額二億四千九百萬元之中之二億元、向明年度預算要求而已、是大正十年來資材整備費之要求、已從財政上延期、而此等資材材料的不能速成、於滿洲事變已有經騐、蓋陸軍方面之態度頗爲强硬、故陸軍預料大藏省必承認資材整備費之大部分（十八日電通電）</p>

<h3>多難興邦艱苦奮鬥</h3>
<p>殊不知當前的國難、並不是（數）完全我们人民所造成、都應歸之於人、所有一切當前困難及任何問題、我们都可以從我们的人事來挽救、來解决的、所以我们在此國難時期中、我们全國人民、應明瞭所以造成國難之原因所在、同時又須認清我们怎樣來救國、國家才可以得救、怎樣來挽救、國難才可解除、如果我们認清了我们救國的大道、我们全國人民就須下一個最大的决心、並常存不努力國必亡、不努力無飯吃之念須向着這條大道、努力邁進、古人有云、（多難興邦）、（無敵國外患者國恒亡）、現在正是中國最難的時候、全國人民應一致醒悟起來、痛改過去種種錯誤的心理、來挽救國家當前之危亡、我们看古今中外、無論國家或個人、其事業之成功、莫不從最困難最艱苦的當中得來、我们中華民族至今日民國二十二年、巳至有史以來最困難最艱苦一個時期、全國人民從今以後、應一致起來、從事於當前救國之要圖、即國防建設、與經濟建設、國防建設、所以抵抗外患、挽救國家之危亡、經濟建設、所以復興瀕於破產之農村、救濟人民之飢餓、國防建設與經濟建設、又須相輔並行、欲求國防建設成功、就要實行經濟建設、要經濟建設成功、也非實行國防建設不可、如全國人民能本此救國要圖、一致從實際上努力做去、將來中國一定可以得到否極泰來的最後成功、今日謹以此意勉我全國同胞、并所以自勉、云云、</p>

<p>本埠寗波班輪·滬臺班輪·温州班輪·瑞平班輪等、昨午十二時、猶凖備出口、故新寗紹新北京等船、依舊乘搭旅客、及午後得到海闗警砲、决計停航、將已上船之搭客、一律退票上岸、改明日（星期三）動身、温臺各船亦中止開行、滬浙海輪、昨日全部止開、同時又發急電到甬、囑寗興新江天等各輪、亦勿開來、故今日亦無寗波輪船進口、</p>
<h3>出口輪展期</h3>
<p>今晨由滬出口之南北洋班輪、有太古之蘇州號·新疆號·盛京號·怡和之捷升號·利生號·及招商局之泰順號·大連汽社之大連九等等、昨日下午、均爲大風暴雨、阻止各輪裝貨工作、下午四時、又得颶風警告、故各公司通告各海輪、將上列應行出口各船、一律展延開期、俟颶風過後、再行開駛、其進口船之不及到滬者、亦電令途中抛泊避風、以免意外、</p>
<h3>浦江潮倒灌</h3>
<p>自入晚八時後、狂風暴雨、齊向本埠襲擊而來、其勢之猛、不亞於上次颶風、風助浪勢、浪藉風威、有若萬馬奔騰、胥向黄浦江上泛、以致低窪之處盡成澤國、茲將昨夜十二時許各處被水狀况、撫拾分記之、</p>
<h3>松滬車中斷</h3>
<p>張華浜地近海濱、與砲台灣、同爲吳淞口旁市鎭、該處堤岸、係以巨石築成、頗稱堅固、惟以年久失修、剥蝕不少、上次巨風過境時、幾釀巨災、當地各機闗、現方力謀興修、詎昨晚又遭風浪打擊、有無危險、截至記者發稿時止、尙無報告、惟悉水勢澈漲不已、八時許、已高與岸齊、至九時許、竟衝入火車軌道、與車站月台高低、相距尺許、形勢頗爲危險、因此淞滬火車、不能前進、僅駛至張華浜站爲止、至十二時左右、張華浜車站及張華浜鐵路工廠亦被水、因此淞滬車至吳淞分路站後、又被阻折回、據悉水勢尙在狂漲不已、形勢至爲嚴重、吳淞方面、以交通完全斷絶、故眞相不明、惟觀水勢洶湧情形、海塘方面、殊難樂觀、</p>
<h3>各馬路浸水</h3>
<p>租界方面、南京路英華街·及浙江路南京路口、北京路貴州路等低窪各馬路、於晚十時左右、亦先後浸水、至十一時許、漲達一尺有奇、南京路九江路漢口路福州路廣東路外灘、繼起被水侵入、逐漸擴大、未幾河南路山東路亦被波及、至十二時許、本館門首水勢、已達一尺有餘、中央捕房門首、幾達三尺許、雖人力車亦難以渡過、汽車完全失效、有中途抛錨者、至十二時半、晝錦里一帶各店舖全被進水、加以狂風怒號、故水勢尙有增無巳、路上行人絶跡、雖人力車亦躱避一光、偶有一二輛在路待僱、亦非巨價不就、</p>
<h3>閘北貧民苦</h3>
<p>閘北南市方面、貧民草棚、被風吹坍者、不計其數、因此一班貧民均鳩形鵠面、避　各衖或屋　之下、更以巨浪接連而來、侵入各處、頓失居身之所、東奔西避、形狀至慘、故昨晚本埠全市幾全處　風雨飄摇之中、形勢至爲危殆、</p>
<h3>淞海塘搶修</h3>
<p>昨晨、吳淞口風雨猛烈、海潮暴漲、最高時、與海塘相差僅五六寸、附近居民、大起恐慌、而上海市工務局方面、仍未見派工到來、遂由吳淞市政委員唐承宗、臨時購辦蔴袋數百只、雇工八十餘人、並派員率同前往吳木峯等一帶海塘、搶修决口、以防萬一、唐委員於昨日上午九時趕滬親往工務局催促、記者於下午冒雨、前往海塘、察勘險狀、見吳木峯一帶之石堤内泥土、亦已鬆陷、據市委辦事處所派之督工劉君告記者云、此段受創己深、工程頗大、刻因風雨頻頻摧殘、故祗能先行搶險决口、其大段工程、俟工務局正式修理云云、記者於四時許離淞、始見外馬路來有工務局卡車數輛、滿載工人、向砲臺灣駛去、</p>
<h3>寳山縣巡塘</h3>
<p>寶山縣政府金慶章·及鮑思仁·宛開甲等、巳嚴飭巡塘員嚴密防範、太倉士紳朱愷儔洪景平等、亦正分向地方公團接洽矣、</p>
<h3>另有一颶風</h3>
<p>又據報告、另一颶風、在台灣東南部海面、於昨晨六時、在北緯二十二度半、東經百二十一度半、方向爲正北、下午二時、移至北緯二十三度及東經百二十三度、方向仍爲正北、</p>
<h3>大美晚報云</h3>
<p>今日（十八）本埠狂風猛雨、又爲颶風來襲之先聲、此爲本年第二十一次颶風、本月十一日發於甘姆之西、初向西方進行、數百哩後、乃折向西北方、在吕宋北部之東北海上轉變風面、直向浙江海濱進發　而於今日下午吹抵温州寗波之間其登陸之後、或可吹過上海之西、·而免本埠受颶風之直襲、惟無論如何在今夜及明晨、本埠之颶風雨、必將加猛　據温州消息、該處風力爲十個單位、又當今晨六時許　長江口外大戢山風力巳達六個單位、並有刻刻加猛之勢、此外復有一颶風、爲本年第二十二次、起於台灣附近向北方進發、緊隨第一颶風之後、風勢亦頗猛烈、惟稍遜於第一颶風云、</p>

<h3>貧男賣身奇聞</h3>
<p>出價六十鎊可得一丈夫</p>
<p>美國紐　西州康登電、女子以貧乏而賣身招夫、固時有之、至男子以貧乏而賣身招婦、則未之聞也、此間某報茲載有一廣告、文曰、失業人海恩氏、年二十五、喪妻、有子甫三齡、甚可愛、今因又母窘困、若有任何體面誠實　人、能出金六十鎊以賙濟之、則願委身事之、可保其爲佳偶也云云、（路透社）以兄弟就把崇實救國一義、作爲今天的講題、希望全國人民、都把崇實的精神來紀念這嚴重的國難、來挽救我们垂危的國運、闗於崇實這一個意義、兄弟從國難以來、無論在何處講演、無論爲何報作文、幾乎每次都直接問接的注意到這一點、記得今年春天、兄弟作播音演講的時候、曾經有一段話、說現在中國最大的危險、就在一般民衆尙不知國難的眞意、不知國難的原因、一般領導民衆奔走救國的、也祇會作形式上的激昻、而不作實際上的努力、所以近百年來、雖每次國難之後　却有救國運動、然而每次救國運動、終不能救得中國、我们覺悟的民衆、　應該痛定思痛、從今以後、澈底認識國難之意義　反省國難的原因、脚踏實地、永下堅苦勇毅、奮鬥救國的决心、從文化上敎育上、各人本分的職務上、以及平時生活方式上、刻苦自勵、切實努力、以充實民族生命的内容、鞏固國家發展之基礎、我们努力了一分就是國家救得了一分、而全國人民分國努力的總和、也就是民族雪恥圖强最後的成功、我们中國民族、本來是世界上一個最先創造文化的民族、中國民族之所以能最先創造文化、就是因爲我们祖先脚踏實地努力從事於改善生活或環　奮鬥的成績、惜乎此種創造文化、崇實奮鬥的精神、從漢朝以後、卽漸漸消失、到了晋魏六朝之時、一般亡國的昏君奸臣貴族富豪敗將殘兵宫女官妓以及文人墨客、更把我们民族固有創造文化的精神、抛棄乾淨放浪淫佚、金迷紙醉對於國家社會的責任、完全不能認識、甚至連個人的生活也毫無宗旨、數千年來敎育的精神、儀在養成情性、而智識階級唯一之慾望、亦在準備怠惰、所謂十年寒窗、不過是一勞永逸的打算近年敎育、雖經改造、然而一船儒者、其所夢寐以求者、亦爲洋房汽車美衣豐食、種種怠惰安樂之工具與設備、至於一般人民的衣食住行、諸種生活上的實際問題　究應如何改善如何解决、則完全不管、完全不負責任、而其本身生活之需要、則在在須仰賴於人、中國社會因爲士大夫的怠惰虚妄和寄生、以致國家敎育與人民生活民族生存不生闗係、全無裨益、舉國上下、都向着這自私貪婪怠廢酣嬉的絶路而蠢動、誰都不願爲民族國家盡其勞動生產的實際責任、生之者寡、食之者衆、則民生安得不蹙、國家安得不窮、民族安得不衰、所以今日我们救國唯一的急務、端在恢復我们民族固有創造文化的精神、脚踏實地、努力從事於民族生產的加增、國民生活的改善、一個民族如果在文化上在經濟上、不能獨立、而在在須依賴外人、實爲一個民族最大的危險、和最大的恥辱、所以自古以來、民族復興的原則、終是注重於生聚與敎訓、在科學文化幼稚的古代、尙且須經十年生聚十年敎訓、以圖復興、則於科學文化突飛猛進的今日、如果不從根本上恢復我们民族創造文化的能力、從實際上刻苦自勵切實努力以充實民族生存的内容、鞏固國家發展之基礎、而僅侈談抗敵、空言救國、則適見民族心理的幼稚虚妄、而救國圖强將永無絲毫的實際、（王延松演說詞從略）</p>

<h3>他才你命</h3>
<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>朱元璋在皇覺寺，忽然動了凡心，不願再伴青燈古佛，提起長槍大刀，殺出濠州，當他定鼎南京時，高興極了，向臣下說道：（不意今日弄假成眞！）可想見他忘形的態度了，他因爲求治太急，往往賞　過當，因而民間有）種傳說。</p>
<p>據說，他有一次多喝點酒，一覺　醒，正想喝茶：恰巧一個在男女之間的太監，端上一碗濃茶來。他快樂非常，赏賜無數。這事被一個窮書獃子知道，作了兩句詩：（十載寒窗下，何如一盞茶？）當他反覆詠誦之時，恰巧朱太祖微遊到此，知道是諷剌他，遂在外續吟道：（他才不如你，你命不如他！</p>
<p>好嗎！中國幾千年來做臣下的升官發財的哲學，和做皇上的用人行政的策略，纔被他兩句詩說破。老實說，就是做官的不一定要大才，只要他命好，便無才也行；有才的不一定做大官，如果他命苦，便大才也不行。官與命是相依的，與才却不相涉。</p>
<p>但是，朱太祖雖然重命輕才，還是要用大宗師去替書獃子看八股，而不用命理家去替書獃子排八字，這總算是甄别眞才，破除迷信了。其實，仍是欺人。這呌做寓命於才，因爲命好的無才也可以連中三元，命苦的仍是倒霉一世。取與不取，依舊在命而不在才。有人問我：（中國現在還是重命呢？還是重才呢？）我却不能回答。但是在野諸公，如果自命爲大才，那就是重命；如果自謂無用，那就是重才。</p>
<p>天下無論什麽事，部有補救的辦法，才不行，那麽在寒窗下用十載工夫；還不行，二十載工夫；再不行，三十載也就得啦。惟有命已註定了，便改不過來。小子窮幾日夜心力，纔想出個半到數的辦法，大家不妨試試。</p>
<p>這個辦法，是請各界男女，於努力下層工作時，先看準一個好日好時，然後舉行。就可合上（竪柱正逢黄道日；上梁又遇紫微星。）一付吉聯，養下男女，一定大富大貴。可以預卜的了。</p>
<h3>鎖與鑰匙</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>我近裝了一把門鎖，於是不得不連帶的想起了闗於鑰匙的話。</p>
<p>中國人對於鎖，是不很考究的。是否因爲中國人有夜不閉户，路不拾遺的美德，還是因爲盜匪充斥，鎖亦無益的緣故，所以在房門上，隨隨便便套上一把用一根鉛絲就可開的鎖，在銀櫃上，隨隨便便裝上一個自來火梗撥得開的鎖就算了。</p>
<p>但是洋貴子，可就不同了。對於鎖，特别考究。同是一把雁兒鎖，却每一把有每一把的構造。所以各把都有不同的鑰鎖。莫說高平牌的鑰匙，不能開雁兒牌的鎖。就是雁兒鎖一百號的鑰匙，也休想可開一百零一號的雁兒鎖。</p>
<p>因爲鎖與鑰匙的闗係，便使我想起了中西學術界的分野。</p>
<p>中國人讀熟了四書五經，會做臣對臣聞的殿試策，金榜掛名之後，便甚麽都行了。立法，司法，行政，色色都可以做。而且做了督撫接着可治河工，若是恰巧蠻子造反，立刻又可拜印征蠻。做了一任御史，即可改住户部尙書，若是高興，還可玩一任甚麽總督，練甚麽軍。這便是象徵着中國鎖上的鑰匙，不拘甚麽鎖都可開。</p>
<p>洋貴子若是研究了甚麽科，便一世莫想改業。他们的醫生，非醫科出身，便莫想執業，不像我们有的是儒醫。他们要吃法律飯，便非法科出身不可，不像我们有的是紹興師爺。這便是象徵着雁兒鎖有雁兒鑰匙，高平鎖有高平鑰匙。而且他们同是工科出身的，習電氣的，便一世吃電氣飯，習鐵路的，一世吃鐵路飯，這便是一百號鑰匙，不能開一百零一號鎖的道理。</p>
<p>這幾年中國派了不少留學生到外國去，想把中國的老式鎖與鑰匙，改造爲西式的，却不料出去研究文學的法律的或是農業的，回來當公安局長，水利局長，或是縣長都行，諸如此類，不一而足。此輩人才，我無以名之，只得名之曰中國化的西式鎖。</p>
<h3>討飯藝術</h3>
<p>— 汪助予</p>
<p>新閘橋堍，有一位羅宋　　　三，像演說似的對着中國的呌化子說：（你们向人家討錢，遠這般縮着頭，　着背，没有一點精神的表現：你看我们羅宋人向人家討銅子兒的時候，總把肚皮挺的高高，必恭必敬的，規而炬之的，先行一個十足的舉手禮，然後再行開口，我们這種交易雖然小，也應該有點藝術。不然施主的錢不是白化了吧？朋友，記着！時代進化了，什麽都要有藝術，我们討飯，當然不能例外，否則就將落伍！）唉！如今之世，討飯確也須要藝術了。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>現在聽到劉家媽這一番話的趨向完全是贊成甘家的，越說是越讓自己生氣，便紅了臉道：劉家媽，　倒以爲人家給您東西，很大的人情呢，其實不過有錢的人家，不願把東西扔到穢土堆裹去，借着窮人的肚子來裝一裝罷了。我說，咱们窮人家，總得掙這一口氣，寗可餓死，也不吃人家剩的。江氏瞪了眼，望着他道；我们老姑娘，就是這個脾氣，嘴快舌快的，不管這話能說不能說，總得說出來，譬如說罷。人家好心好意的給你一些吃的，無論你願意要不願意要，反正你在面子上，總得暫時收了下來。終不成甘太太給劉家媽東西，劉家媽倒摔到地下去。劉家媽被桂枝大刀闊斧的一陣說着，本來是有些不好意思。現在江氏搶着先和他解說了，這總算有了轉圓的地步。因就笑道：還是我们老嫂子說的話不錯。你想我们窮人家，打算不看富貴人家一點顔色，那如何辦的到？江氏道；要說端一點官排子呢，他们老爺，也許有一點。至於他们甘太太和我们一樣，都是房門裹的人，靠的人紅，跟了人黑，那還有什麽話說？如此的說起來，更是給了劉家媽一種轉圜的機會了，他以先看到積之常到這邊來的，想着他母女二人，也許我甘積之的感情不錯，便道：他们甘二爺倒是很好。江氏知道自己姑娘，受了積之的剌激最深，這句話更是要了他的命，這絶對不敢引起那些闗係話來，就用鼻子哼了一聲。然而劉家媽對於這些原故，完全不知道，他高起興來了，却把這話，繼續的向下說。（一九一）</p>
<h3>看人學樣</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>記得小時候讀書，在一本敎科書上，瞧見有這麽一課說：（有一個賣帽子的商人，挑了一担大大小小的帽子，停在一個山脚下休息。那山脚下有一顆大樹，豈知那顆大樹上，有許多猢猻，見那賣帽子的商人，頭上戴了一頂帽子，覺得新奇，於是相率從樹上下來，把那一担帽子，搶了個精光，都把帽子戴在頭上逃上了樹。後來，那賣帽子的商人，情急智生，忙把自己頭上戴的一頂帽子，脫下來丢在地上，於是樹上的猢猻，見了也把搶來戴在頭上的帽子，紛紛擲下！）這便是（看人學樣）。</p>
<p>本來猢猻是最喜歡看人學樣的，不足爲奇。所奇者，那班具有智識的（人），</p>
<p>往往有許多地方，也會看人學樣。現在譬如說：西洋人和西洋人，彼此相見，說話當然愛皮西地，嘰哩咕嚕。但是，有許多明明是中國人和中國人，會面交談，放着很好的（國語）不說，也定要說那嘰哩咕嚕的（外國語！）這也是（看人學樣）。</p>
<p>再如（跳舞）啊，（接脗）啊：（吃大菜）啊；（服用洋貨）啊；一時要說也說不盡這許多。總而言之，不論是風俗，人情；衣着；吃喝；以及種種的享用；凡是沾染了西洋色彩的，在一般時髦人物講來是（歐化），其實拆穿西洋鏡說；那一件不是（看人學樣）？所謂（歐化）者，不過是好聽話兒。</p>
<p>雖然，我们知道，日本明治維新，看的也是歐美的榜樣，學的也是歐美的模範，到如今還不過數十年，居然一躍而躋於世界强國之列，這般看來，（看人學樣，）倒並非不可取。不過要看你看人家的是什麽榜樣，學人家的是什麽模範。如果看人家的壞樣，學人家的皮毛，那麽，與猢猻的（看人學樣），有什麽分别？</p>

<p>小常識</p>
<h3>闗於蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 慎言</p>
<p>有一個春天，我不幸害了一塲很閩害的病，病後醫生再三叮嚀我必須易地療養，以防復發，於是我就爲着怕死的緣故，一個人躱到了鄰近崑山的一個小鎭上去。鎭上的居户連公安局派出所和幾座小廟一起算在其内，也不到五十家，晚上七點鐘之後，或是下雨的日子，就聽不到半些人聲。日子當然是很難過了。造化，在我所住的那所屋子的間壁，有一位姓蘇的先生却養着好幾箱的蜜蜂，彷彿是預先特地給我端正下的一件消遣品。每天清早，我就趕過去張望，一直看到吃飯，吃過飯繼續再看，非到天黑，無蜂可看，不肯回去。這樣看了幾十天，我才開始認識了蜂的偉大。</p>
<p>總括一句說，蜂實在是一種最勤懇，最有秩序的動物，在他们的一羣裹，除掉幼虫之外，没有不工作而能生存的。他们都有一個王，大家都很忠實謹慎地擁戴着它，每年在出發採蜜之前，全體的工蜂會在蜂箱的外面一排一排地排列着，頭對着蜂箱，聽候王的檢閱，檢閱完畢，該採蜜的便去採蜜，該回箱守護幼虫的便回箱，該在箱外担任警衛職務的便一刻不離地在箱外守着，一個也不會亂走。更奇怪的是每一個蜂在洞口進出，必得向守衛的蜂打一個招呼，而且似乎有規定的時間，一過規定時間，便一概不准進出。有一次，蘇先生爲着要使我知道蜂的紀律嚴明起見，特地捉了一頭蜂，把他闗在一個小匣子裹，過了一夜，用硃筆在他身上點了一點，再放他回去。隔了一個鐘頭，我们同到各個蜂箱門首去看時，果然在某一個蜂箱的首面，發現這個身有硃點的蜂已經屍横地下了，當然是因爲他一夜不歸，所以被守衛的蜂螫死的。我们的試騐是成功了，可惜這頭蜂生生地給我们害死了。</p>
<p>每當一個新王出世之後，舊蜂王（卽新王之母）必於第二日帶着全部新的工蜂離箱他去，而讓那些舊的工蜂給侍新王。前一天晚上，蜂箱裹必整夜不得安靜，嗡嗡嗡嗡地彷彿在那裹話别一樣。所以養蜂的人逢到了這種情形，第二天清早，必得端正下一具新的蜂箱，好讓舊王來安頓，不然這一羣蜂便一去而不復返了。　　兩羣不同的蜂碰在一起的時候，也不免要起一塲惡鬥的。但是在戰事結束之後，得勝的蜂終會自動的担負起掩埋工作來的。他们就用他们的脚把一些死蜂從地上勾起，一直勾到　面上所舖的瓦片的罅縫裹，很小心地掩藏起來；一個又一個，非得把所有的蜂屍全部藏好，他们决不會撤手而走的。</p>
<p>虫類大多以雌的爲尊，蜂當然也如此。蜂王，工蜂，完全是雌的，不過工蜂的尾上有一條剌，所以不能交尾，蜂王出世之後，也祗交尾一次，交過一次，便永不能再交，却能生育無盡。交尾的情形也是很特别的，先是一個尙屬處女的蜂王獨自在空中來來往往地飛着，不多一會就有許多雄蜂擁過來追求了。這追求兩個字，眞是最爲切當。因蜂王一見雄蜂们到來，便立卽落魄而走，那些雄蜂自然是拚命似的追去，誰先追到，勝利便屬於誰。可是樂極生悲，待到交尾完結，他的生殖器便陷入蜂王的尾部，再也抽不出來了，結果蜂王就把他的生殖器帶着走了，這隻蜂便做了牡丹花下死的風流鬼。然而，經此一番交合以後，那蜂王也永不能再行交合了。</p>

<h3>東亞因禍得福</h3>
<p>曁南徐亨的是名將</p>
<p>網上功夫堪嘆觀止</p>
<p>男子組夏光對東亞、先行比賽、第一局夏光悉用大夏球員出戰、受東亞之重大壓迫、以八比二十一負、全隊陣容散　、不能呼應、鐵臂英雄衛鼎彝、因無搭擋用武無地、第二局起調進曁南球員徐亨顧尙　　洪　等數人、陣容爲之一新、徐亨之網上工作、聲東擊西殺球如閃電、令人莫測、同時衛鼎彝得徐亨之援助、大施高壓妙技、東亞相顧失色、横遭壓迫、連負三局、夏光反敗爲勝　但徐亨等因未註册、當卽判夏光棄權、東亞因禍得福、反獲勝利、昨日戰績如下、</p>
<p>夏光</p>
<p>八比二十一　念一比十五　二十一比七　二十一比七</p>
<p>東亞</p>
<p>東亞雖無特長　但全隊人材平均、聯絡尙佳、夏光隊雜亂無章、望而知全憑天材、而無訓練、第一局東亞、帆風順、以二十一比八勝、第二局夏光先以十一比八調換塲面、至十三比十一時曁南徐亨等調人、軍容忽盛、鬱鬱不得志之衛鼎彝、得徐亨之助、如魚得水、得以施展妙技、殺球如砲彈、每奏奇功、從此一路順風、以二十一比十五勝、第三四兩局、夏光愈形得手、東亞銳氣挫喪、一蹶不振連以七比二十一失敗、陣綫如下、</p>

<p>海星闗柳珠大顯身手　務本以聯絡紳熟見長</p>
<p>海本與海星、實力不相上下、兩隊表演、未見十分高妙、海星闗柳珠小姐、工作緊張、殺球佳妙、海星之得分、闗有大功、爲兩隊中最出色之人材、汪春若手法靈活、純熟細膩　闗小姐之得以爲所欲爲、全得力於汪、二人一搭一當、得心應手、極受觀衆讀美、惟全體不能呼應、時露慌張、致遭慘敗、務本則以人材平均聯絡純熟見長、並無特殊出色之處、是戰成績如下、</p>

<h3>第二局海星得勝</h3>
<p>第二局起爲海星陳英瑞發球、互前互後、七比七後、海星突先發制人、以十一比七佔優上半局、務本追上至十一比一、海星汪春若發球有勁、連取五分、而後闗柳珠柳肩倒豎、奮勇殺球、頻頻得分、務本遭此挫折、精神喑淡、一籌莫展、海星　以二十　比十五勝、</p>
<h3>末兩局海星慘敗</h3>
<p>第三四兩局之上半局、形勢均極平均、下半局中、海星每先於疏怱、務未始終如一、工作緊凑、每能救球於危急、此爲海星所不如、第三局務本以十一比十勝前半局、調換方向、海星一度以十四比十二佔先、但　花一現、務本忽以十七比十四反佔前茅、卒以二十一比十七勝局、第四局、海星以十一比九勝前半局、此後卽爲務本超出、張碧如女士發球殊佳、每奏膚功、王雪華每以觸網失分、但其發球所獲分數、亦復不少、是局結果、務本又以二十一比十七勝、兩隊陣窘如下、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>（怒吼吧，中國！）幕前</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>原作者Ｓ．Ｔretyakov說：（這些都是事實：我未嘗改變過什麽。加以這案件本身就是一個特徵呀！）</p>
<p>是的，這是事實，這是我们見慣的事實：這是特徵，但這是被我们忽視了的特徵。</p>
<p>就這對於事實的見慣和對於特徵的忽視，可以解釋爲什麽這樣的戲劇的作者是俄國人而非中國人。正因爲見慣了（白上帝）的横暴，成了常事了，我们的作家遂忽視之，看不出什麽特徵。但在外人，尤其是俄國人，看來黨然是分明的。</p>
<p>（革命文學），（民族文學），我们有是有的。但是這些文學所告訴我们的，總是某此（革命家），（民族英雄），在領導着，指揮着，所以革命起來了，民族運動起來了。結果呢。我们只看到革命家和民族英雄的悲歡離合丨大抵還穿插着戀愛。若問革命和民族運動，則老是（雲深不　處）。</p>
<p>這戲劇，則將（怒吼的是誰？）（怎樣怒吼起來的？）這眞實告訴我们了。</p>
<p>但我以爲最於我们有用的敎訓，是作者的這幾句話：（一再從外國槍砲底下保下來的城市，終於在一九二六年給他们毁壞了。）欲求瓦全，終不可得，那麽不如玉碎罷。所以作者大聲疾呼（怒吼吧，中國！）</p>
<p>闗於戲劇恊社的公演，我也想說幾句話·就是，這樣的公演，離開（爲大衆所要求）的目標，是還遼遠的，在中國，這樣的票價，是只有在都市裹能夠演，因此也只能供小市民作一刹那間的興奮劑用的。</p>
<p>不過，我並非有心對現今的戲劇運動表示不敬。那目標和努力，我是都很佩服的。我只是希望從事這運動的人，更加努力，去接近那目標。</p>
<h3>范成大與劉大白</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>偶然翻讀石湖詩集，覺得那位（望重百僚，名滿四海）的（大參相公），丨范成大，好像劉大白一樣，雖是官僚，也頗同情於農民，小販，乞丐，手工業者。不過劉大白生于現代，詩裹略添一點點社會思想，似乎在學時髦。而且他的賣布謡一類的詩，做官以後，他就不肯下筆，他肯下筆的是想怎樣改良打官話的公文，他的美麗的舊夢，給庸俗的官話喝破了丨</p>
<p>說到劉大白的舊夢，這也和許多新式才子佳人一樣，不外戀愛革命之類的東西，人云亦云的新生常談，丨這可不必說是老生常談。他做到了敎育部次長，革命總算成功了罷，却不曾對照古本，和他所憧憬的世界何如。戀愛雖然有詩爲證，我還没有看到下文，自然，生在今日，做官而討小老婆，那是做官須知裹應有的文章，何必扭扭揑揑地戀愛呢。</p>
<p>范成大也是一位風雅的官僚，我们讀他的石湖詞，然可略略考見他（少年豪縱）（老恐花枝覺）的享樂生活。因爲我们已經知道所謂（詞）的一種東西，正是那個時代流行的活文學，好像如今（毛毛雨）一類的曲子，應當列在有閒階級的藝術裹一樣。無福享受醇酒婦人歌唱的生活，是和這類藝術無緣的。生在現代的劉大白，不肯隨著毛毛雨一流詩人去走，却想填着幾首白話詞，做了（詞的解放）的先驅運動，可謂誤人子弟了。有誰看見現代的跳舞塲中，鋼琴聲裹，歌著解放的詞呢？</p>
<p>據說劉大白身後蕭條，幾乎喪葬也没有法子，倘若這是確實的話，那倒是我们應該深爲歎惜的。做了大官，死了還没有錢買棺材，這樣的（災官）似乎少有，雖說敎育部是一個比較清淡的衙門，部長次長總不會一寒至此罷丨范成大做到宰相一類的官，自然是闊極了。他有别墅呌做石湖，是皇帝替他題上的，他就自號石湖居士。他的朋友楊萬里說：（石湖山水之勝，東南絶境。）原來他是大地主。但不知道劉大白居杭州，可有西湖别墅没有？</p>
<p>劉大白反對鬼話文，做白話詩，在五四運動之後，没有什麽令人驚異。范成大恰恰生在道學腐儒漸漸抬頭的時代，白話語錄出來了，近於白話的道學詩出來了，乃至使用時事當典故的江湖詩派也出來了，他的詩要用平易自然的文字，那也是没有什麽稀奇的。不過他歡喜歌詠田園山水，不抬著聖經賢傳的骸骨來嚇活人，那却是他比同時那些有腐儒氣的詩人來得高明一點的地方。</p>
<p>我以爲范成大的田園詩，很能代表封建地主階級對於田園美和自然美的欣賞，禮讚，憧憬，感傷。倘用一個譬喻來說，好像吃膩了鷄鴨魚肉的闊人，却羨慕貧民吃的青菜豆腐。不過從他最小一部分詩裹，還可以看出他闗心那些困苦顛連而呻吟於黑暗之底的農民。開倉發賑，下令驅蝗，雖說有詩爲證，究竟還是當官而行的官樣文章一類。催租行寫里正的苛索（草鞋費），後催租行寫災民無力完納租稅，至於賣衣鬻女，這都算是爲貧苦農民呼籲的詩。還有小販那種慘苦的呌賣聲音也常常使他聽了難過，不免吟詩一首。他說；（牆外賣藥者，九年無一日不過，吟唱之聲甚適，雪中呼問之，家有十口，一日不出，即飢寒矣。）他作的詩是：</p>
<p>十口啼號責望深，寗容安穏坐氈針。長鳴大咤欺風雪，不是甘心是苦心。</p>
<p>這比豐子愷先生一流的藝術家，把老病的乞丐當米勒的名畫一般欣賞，（見緣緣堂隨筆）似乎來得高明多了。再錄石湖兩首小詩：</p>
<p>飯蘿驅出敢偷閒？雪脛冰鬚慣忍寒。豈是不能扃户坐，忍寒猶可忍飢難。</p>
<p>啼號升斗抵千金，凍雀飢鴉共一音。勞汝以生令至此，悠悠大塊一何心！</p>
<p>這是他在雪中聞牆外鬻魚菜者求售之聲甚苦，有感而作。倘他眞把這種勞動貧苦的社會現象歸之天運，這就要呌現代的革命家失笑的。再錄他的詠河市歌者一首：</p>
<p>豈是從容唱渭城？個中當有不平鳴。可憐日晏忍飢面，强作春深求友聲。范石湖也知道貧苦階級有他们的不平之鳴了。所以我總覺得近人劉大白一流投機的革命詩，自賣布謡以下，没有什麽了不起的地方。至多也只能說是他们的思想左得比白居易范石湖稍爲進步，還得感謝時代的敎訓。</p>
<h3>偶感二章</h3>
<p>— 唐</p>
<p>（一）傳記文學</p>
<p>前幾天看到郁達夫先生的傳記文學，不能無感·寫出來，以博敎於幾位寫自傳和評傳的專家。</p>
<p>郁先生對於目前文壇没有較好的傳記出現，似乎頗以爲憾，其實這祗是當然的事。傳記所需要的是透澈的全部的事迹，和冷靜的旁觀的頭腦，所以特别適宜於身後。</p>
<p>新文學流行到現在，充其量不過十幾年工夫。那些首創的學者，大都健在；而且有的正在轉變方面，從新打起精神做人（？）。早先譏諷指謫，現在歌頌擁戴；早先捨大道而不由，現在走上了康莊大道，由異端變成正端；將來是否尙有變化，便是劉伯温也難預料。如果在這時便去替他们寫傳作記，抹煞了前因後果，這就有些使人不大放心！</p>
<p>至於近來市上流行的，大都是那裹人，有幾個兄弟，每餐吃幾碗飯，鼻子是否生在兩眼中間等等。此外也就毫無生氣，彷彿進得山門來，抬頭一望，個個都是菩薩面孔。</p>
<p>本來拉上幾個朋友，互相捧捧，或者把名家捧得高一些，自己藉此進身，這便是評傳的由來。萬一没有人寫評傳，或者評傳裹所說的不利於己，於是挺筆桿而起，雄糾糾的，親自來吹一下，又得說是自傳。</p>
<p>朋友们怕傷交情，無名作家想藉此進身·自己想乘間吹吹，這都是因爲活著的闗係。</p>
<p>所以，如果說黄種人並不較白種人劣一等的話，那末要有好的傳記出現，祇須巴望那些善變的名家早些死去。</p>
<p>（二）斯文喪盡</p>
<p>據說從十月一日起·各省市政府的公文，要採用新式標點了；同時律師撰狀和法院判决書，也將改用白話，這一來，在存心世道者的筆頭上，不免又多了些嗚呼文章。</p>
<p>這眞是没有辦法的事，（天之將喪斯文也），這眞是没有辦法的事丨</p>
<p>從五四到現在，國貨八股帶跌帶爬，緊緊的跟在新文學後面，巳經心力俱疲，奄奄欲絶了。可是今年畢竟是一個可紀念的年頭，（賢聖之君六七作），旣有人主張讀經，又有人提倡復古；政餘多暇，結社吟詩；文治盛世，一般儒門之後，莫不額手稱慶，以爲先聖之道學，將復見於今日。</p>
<p>不料時隔不久，（的了呢麽）的新文學，竟然當選了。這一個倒栽筋斗，直跌得呌苦連天。</p>
<p>於是：（嗚呼，斯文喪盡矣！）</p>
<h3>愛書狂者之話</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>十年前，購得（施註杜詩）一部，有涇縣查氏手校，藏書，子穆讀過，查日華等章。歸家翻閱，其間竟藏有梅曾亮名片，及梅曾亮親筆小簡各一，喜出望外。其小簡云：</p>
<p>弟現在收拾書箱，頗有壓多之意。前八弔錢所買蘇詩，吾兄若須者，即可奉讓，亦不必原價。如巳買得，祈示知也。此頌辰佳，不具。即候回示。子穆吾兄年大人。年弟梅曾亮頓。</p>
<p>當時曾將此簡借給商務製版發表於（小說世界）十三卷。名片當然是中國舊式的，印木刻（梅曾亮）三字，朱紅紙，上註數語，是送查子穆藕粉等用的。於此知我所購（蘇詩），實係梅曾亮藏本。名家賣書，在這小簡内，可謂又得一意趣。</p>
<h3>淺湖（九）</h3>
<p>— 英國約瑟康拉德作　侍　桁　譯</p>
<p>在這深沈的寂靜裹，阿薩特的聲音高高地震動着。</p>
<p>（我獲得了她！我獲得了她！爲得到她，我敢面對着全人類。但是我獲得了她丨於是丨丨</p>
<p>他的話語，向着空虚的遠方發着嚮。他停住了，好像在靜聽着這聲音消失在遥遥的遠方丨丨没有再招回來的方法。於是他靜靜地說丨</p>
<p>（屠安，我愛我的哥哥。）</p>
<p>一陣微風使我戰颤了。在他的頭上，在那雲霧的靜寂的海上，棕梠樹葉磨擦着，發出哀悲的絶滅的聲音。那個白人展開了他的雙腿。他的下頦搭在他的胸上，隨後他並不抬起頭來悲哀地囁嚋着丨</p>
<p>（我们都愛我们的兄弟。）</p>
<p>阿薩特以小聲而是激越的口調呌起來丨</p>
<p>（旁人的死我管他作什麽呢？我所要的是我自己内心的平和。）</p>
<p>他仿彿聽見屋裡有　聲了，靜聽着，便悄悄地走了進去。那個白人站起身來。一陣微風激動地吹過去。繁星更慘淡地閃爍了，好像它们已經退入了廣大空間的凝固的奥底裹。一陣冷風吹過了之後，有那半天是完全地沈默和絶對地寂靜。其後，在樹林的黑暗蜿蜒的劃線的後面，一柱金黄色的光線，從天堂裹放射出來，而且在東方的地平線上展成一個半圓形。太陽昇起來了。雲霧也開朗了，形成漂動的破片，而消失成稀薄的飛行的氣息；這時那淺湖脫了遮蓋，在列樹的根下，在濃厚地陰影裹，黑暗而發着光。一羽白鷲，傾斜地飛起來，飛到明淅的腸光裹，在一刻之間顯示出眩眼的輝耀，隨又更高地飛翔着，在它還没有消失在天青色之間，變成一塊濃黑的靜止的斑點，好像從此就永遠離開了世界一樣。那個白人，站在門前向天下凝視着，聽見小屋裹起了斷續的混亂的囁嚅聲，最後是痛苦的呻吟。突然阿薩特伸着雙手，踉蹌着走出來，渾身戰慄，眼光凝固地靜立了一會。隨後他說丨</p>
<p>（她不再發燒了。）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米麥有加稅風傳　期粉麥有加速高漲</h3>
<p>粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份一致呈激漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲一元一角零、坎拿大漲四角左右、故開價時、市氣已轉穏定、旋又傳政府方面、將實行加徵收洋米麥之稅則、因此外行人心、亦隨之高昻、故蟄伏之人心、不免爲之利用、各月份收價、均較好一分外、迨至下午各盤、各月份之買氣、更見暢盛、傳本外、埠之雜糧帮、收買尤狂、致近遠各期、又步步高騰、至廠家方面、聞福新略出、餘則不動、天津報價、小二分、開二元二角八分、秦皇島傳跌四分、照實銷地點、依然趨疲、則此種漲度、仍恐人心作用也、結果本月份較前週漲二分半、十月份漲三分二厘半、十一十二月份漲三分七厘半、一月份漲三分二厘半、二月份漲四分、</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、呈初定繼則大漲之態以洋麥報價、回漲四角零至一元一角左右、故開價時人心已定、後又傳洋米麥將實行加稅、有米每擔加一元半之說、本外埠之糧業行家、因有此種情形、均引起注意、各月份之　買、隨亦聯連轉暢、致各月份市問、亦步步狂騰、雖粉銷依然不暢、將來是否需要此種救濟、則投機者、仍未考慮及之也、結果本月份漲八分、十月份至一月份漲九分、現麥市况、已入定局、到貨續有、廠胃亦活、開五河麥三元九角三分、瑶灣麥三元八角九分、東台麥三元七角八分　潼麥三元七角八分、次七角三分、黄橋麥三元八角三分、六合麥三元六角三分、揚州麥三元六角三分、高郵麥三元七角三分、南京麥三元五角七分、浦鎭麥三元六角、蕪湖麥三元五角、由福新出五千包、申大出五千包、信大去一千包、</p>

<h3>油市　柏油市一蹶不振</h3>

<h3>病中　乾序</h3>
<p>這幾天的天氣是特别熱，而焂然的凉又來得非常之快，一會兒吹風，一會兒灑兩，身體素來孱弱而終日在街頭奔波着的瑜，却不勝其感冒而病了，病了，眞的病了丨</p>
<p>爲着要生活，爲着要掙取麵包，他雖然具有着胃病，他却不能像養尊處優慣的富人们一樣去休養；更没有福份進醫院；他連買藥的錢都籌不出來。他祗有（拖），不差，（拖）是窮人们對付（病）的無可奈何而是極妙的方法！</p>
<p>然而，現在他却失敗了，（拖）於病魔巳是不能發生效力；他即使要生活，要挣取麵包，而萬惡的病麽巳是不允許他了。他雖是萬分的焦急，没有用，他祗能睡在床上，周圍不到一丈的斗室裹，小得像狗　的窗洞，悶得氣都透不轉來！</p>
<p>這時，他眼望着天花板，胃中藴着緩慢的微痛，身上發着高度的熱，心憧　着來日的生活。貧，病，交織成一面嚴密的網，深深的把籠罩在裹面。而窗外的雨點，兀自敲打着窗櫺，無情的風，依舊呼呼地吹着。</p>
<p>他没有朋友，更没有親戚，他在上海祗他孑然一身，他一天不工作就得把肚子餓起來，所以他没有積蓄。這突然而來的病，他毫没有預先想到。故而没錢請醫生、更没有方法可以袪退病魔，他祇能等待病的自然演化！</p>
<p>在他醒着的時候，眼前是非常清靜，没有笑的臉，没有虚僞的表情，没有紅頭洋鬼子，更没有女人的大腿；與他眼廉所接觸的，祇是天花板，不透氣的窗櫺，簡單的用具等。而他的耳朶却忙起來了：無線電的音樂聲，小販喊賣聲，急促的救護車的鈴聲，風雨打窮聲……一切的一切，一陣陣敲擊着他的耳鼓，使他煩惱，不耐！然而是没有辦法。</p>
<p>他亦有曚朧的時候，而夢樣的情緒又跑上了他的心頭：他想到故鄉，他想到故去的父母，更想到飄泊的兄弟，他似乎是一個失足跌落在深淵裹了，把他驚出了一身冷汗。</p>
<p>這丨汗丨於他似乎不是没有益處的，亦或者是休養了數天的原故吧，風寒漸漸的退了，熱度漸漸的平了，雖然他的身體尙疲弱得可憐，然而爲了掙取麵包的原因，孤獨而創痕未復的他，不得不重行拖起孱弱的身子，依舊去踏上奮鬥的征途。</p>
<h3>福州風俗談　嫁娶</h3>
<p>陳　瑀</p>
<p>當女子出嫁的前一天或兩天，照例要實行）辟穀絶粒）的把戲，其用意無非要預防在花轎裹，或到男家時，發生大小便。如果不幸有這樣的事情發生，那不特無法解决，並且男家還認爲不祥之兆；或因此她倆感情不和，發生悲劇。眞是（不幸生爲女兒身）啊！</p>
<p>出嫁的前一夕，女兒和母親，都哭得（不亦樂乎）！哭的方式，不是我们普通受剌激時，號淘大哭；也不是（背人墜涙）的嗚咽小哭。牠是似哭非哭的唱（問答式）的小歌：爲母親的，常唱出：）妹呀妹，去着人家要聽（唐晡）嘴呀妹！呀！）要聽唐晡嘴，就是要從丈夫的話）（奶呀奶，女兒年少不知禮呀！奶）！（福州人呌母親，普通多呌（奶））女兒照例的這樣答着。如果你不知道這種風俗，聽着這種小歌，眞是莫明其妙呢！　　臨嫁時，爲母親的，要先替女兒辦好洗頭剃面兩種手續，以後把她擁出大堂。這時父母親端坐在堂上，女兒雙膝下跪，表示謝絶他兩老養育之恩。同時他兩老要替她戴上（蓋頭羅）（女子出嫁時，所戒的一種冠），以後就正式上轎了。但是在將要上轎時，女兒常常做出一種不願去的態度，經家人再五再六的推擁，好像很勉强的才上轎去。</p>
<p>轎起行時，家人都用含涙的眼相送。惟有母親和她的轎上的女兒，又大彈她们昨晚的舊調來了。同時母親還拿着許多瓜子或小麥，向轎的頂面亂抛。這種舉動，有兩種用意，一（瓜子）是表示女兒出嫁後，生男育女，爪瓞綿綿；一（小麥）是表示女兒將來不至挨餓。但這時却有一種矛盾的行爲，就是轎一出門，就要把大門　住，好像如果稍慢一點，那所謂（風水），一定要被她吸去。如此迷信，實是罕聞。</p>
<p>花轎將到男家的當兒、新郎和他的父親，一定要迴避的。相傳花轎入門時，有一種專殺他们的（煞氣），如果不迴避被牠衝着，縱使不會一命嗚呼，至少也要病得半死。</p>
<p>轎放堂中，這時男家要呌一個年約七八歳的小孩，站在轎門前，請她下轎。有義務自然也有權利，那伴房（新娘伴）就將她在女家預備好的一包禮物（通常是錢）送給他，表示謝意。這時新郎己出來了，所謂四　八拜的隆重大禮，就是在這時實行。不過交拜時做新郎的，一定要知道一點，就是第七拜或最後一拜不要下跪，以示（男尊女卑）的意思，如果不這樣，那難免貽笑來賓了·</p>
<p>接着就實行所謂（坐床），什麽呌做（坐床）呢？就是他倆點（男左女右）的方式，不言不語的坐在牀旁。這時有一件很有趣味的事情，無論男女，都想把對方的衣襟拉來坐在自己皮股的下面，這用意是，這樣一來，將來對方一定會服從他或她的。記得不久的以前，我有一個親戚，他的頭腦本來不大清楚，當結婚時，他的友人哄他說（如果新娘把你的衣襟拉去坐，你一定要站起來，以示不服之意）。他竟照話實行，結果衣襟拉破半尺。</p>
<p>現代名人書畫</p>
<p>刁秋生先生　（略歷）</p>
<p>石麟字　生别署厂鹿現服務於滬西　新第二紗　工　之　　　　　　　　　　　　　　坐床的時間極短，最多不過一刻鐘。這時伴房就呌新郎（升冠）（把新娘的冠拉下），同時呌了許多來賓來鑒賞新人的本色。隨後新娘就改裝了，改裝後他倆步出堂中·實行（敲竹槓）的把戲。所謂（敲竹槓）者，就是新郎拼命的拉家人或來賓，要他们端坐堂上，受他倆一拜，拜後他们一定要送一種禮物。這時來賓和家人東跑西竄，（父母親或祖母例外）煞是有趣！</p>
<p>（敲竹槓）後，他倆同進廚房，拜（司福灶君）。這時新娘無論你怎樣嬌弱，一定要去井邊或江干挑兩桶水回來，以示能勝中饋之任。</p>
<p>晚上照例開始鬧房，鬧的手續，來賓站在門邊，一面用手敲門，一面唱着所謂（房門詩），唱到相當的時候，伴房才把房門打開，讓他進來，如果你不會唱，那就休想鬧了。鬧的方式，大概都是點戲齣，如（李太白脫靴）啦，一觀音滴露）啦，應有儘有。如果這時他倆不遵照來賓的話實行，那就是（哲古）他们，呌他们（掏籠臂）回去（（哲古）（掏籠臂）都是丢臉的意思），這種（哲古）和（掏籠臂）非同小可的，往往因此，而親戚失去感情。所以新郎新娘無論如何，都要實行。記得從前我有一位朋友，結婚時，他的親戚，要看新娘的臍子，新娘當然是不願意的，但又恐怕親戚感情破裂，所以只得把全套新的衣服，用剪刀朝正臍的地方，穿成一孔，來賓固然很樂，但是次日新娘却懸樑自盡了。在現在廿世紀，尙遺留此種惡習，眞是（豈有此理）？</p>
<p>鬧房至少總要鬧到晚上一二點鐘才可以結束，結束後他倆自然預備睡了。但是這時伴房却出來大敲新郎的竹槓她拿一塊方形的紅布（福州話呌做（狀元包），那天晚上交媾用的）給他，要他賞賜　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　其數，她無論如何，不肯退出，有意地延擱你一刻千金的良夜。還有一個奇例，就是這時新郎袋裹如果有錢，任你數目多少，都要被她搜去，不能加以反抗的。</p>
<p>次日女家，照例要派一人來一請雙行）（請雙行，就是請他倆同去女家），但是不可以隔宿的，無論路途多遠。都要回來。此後尙有（請三日）（請十日）（請滿月）等，請得不亦樂乎丨不過所請的多是單行，新郎通常没有參加，所以他倆都不大願意，但習俗如此，又不可不行·煞是可憐！</p>
<h3>辭職</h3>
<p>唯凡是决定走了，在他住的那個很小的房間裹，本來也不過僅僅有一張檯子，一張椅子，和迎着門的一張床。今天房裹的什物，都經過他的整理，夕陽由對過牆上返照進來，更顯得清爽了；檯子上没有一件東西，而且很干凈，床的面前平放着兩個箱子，和一個縛紥好了的舖蓋，床上還剩一頂　貼貼的空帳子；他帶倚式的坐在椅子上，眼睛直望着巳經預備好放在床面前的行李，一動也不動，憧憬着他離職後將要遭遇到的命運和局境，忽然他立起身來，　情似乎更决定了，頓了頓脚，嘴裹咕嚕着：</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>是的，唯凡的職業，太使他不能滿足了，他到Ｃ埠Ｔ廠來辦事，巳是整整四個年頭了，來時就使他不大滿足每月八元的月薪，到現在絲毫没有增加過，而且最近Ｔ廠的經理，又藉口營業不佳，發出（八折發薪）的通告了，這怎麽使他耐得著，經過一塲長久的反覆思潮，唯凡决定對於現有的職業，不再繼續幹下去了。</p>
<p>（幹嗎？我發獃？千里迢迢跑出來，是爲了前途毫没希望幾塊錢月薪的職司嗎？……不幹！辭職！走他娘！）　　他寫信給從前介紹他來的在上海的他的一位舅父，說明了他不得不辭職的苦衷，請他在可能範圍内替他另設别法，却不敢就辭職，只向經理請准了四個星期的假，准備見他舅父去。</p>
<p>現在他一切都准備好了，暫時在房間裹休息休息，就等今晚開到上海的上水輪船，離開他未到四年的地方。</p>
<p>一路很平安，第二天的晚間唯凡發現在他舅父家中的客廳中了，會見了他的舅父，他用委婉的態度，唇乾舌焦地重申前意，再細細地陳明了他不得不辭職的原因，和前途没有希望的狀况，結果他舅父除了告訴他工商凋敝，人浮於事無其他方法可想之外，還斬釘截鐵地呌他假滿回廠。</p>
<p>（是的，没辦法！工商凋敝，人浮於事，有什麽辦法可想呢？）唯凡細細體味着他舅父威脅式的話，同時又想到：（除非回家吃老米飯，然而，親戚的物議，家庭的狀况，？？？？怎麽呢…………）</p>

<p>軍事當局：你去一趙罷。主要的是探聽他有什麽意見。</p>

<h3>克拉克蓋博病勢沉重</h3>
<p>— 赫爾</p>
<p>出外行獵寒濕侵入肺部　回好萊塢盲腸炎又大發</p>
<p>稱爲男性典型，名盛一時的克拉克蓋博，現在病重得很。美國的電影雜誌，都載着他的病狀。有一本雜誌說（我们雖然不能說克拉克蓋博將永遠脫離景界、但我们已調查清楚，斷定他要是再回到銀幕上的話，至少要好幾個月，决不是幾個星期，可以望他復元的。公司方面雖然極盼望他能早占勿藥，並且替他宣傳着，說他拒絶和瓊克勞馥演合演無女）一片，係因爲他不喜歡那劇本，所以推托他病了。其實克拉克蓋博的病，並不是推托，而是眞病，並且病得很厲害也。）</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博的病，是由上次出外打獵而生的。他是極喜歡野外運動的。他每逢假期或是攝影塲工作停止的時候，就約了許多朋友到野外山中去打犰或釣魚。不過從前總有許多人同去，並且男女都有，而克拉克的夫人亦總參加的。克拉克因爲他的夫人同去，還有許多女人们，總覺得玩得不痛快。他說（總有一天我孤帶一位好朋友，出去打犰，儘量的玩一下。我最討厭女人跟在後面，呌男人（提防呀，小心呀；那個山凹太危險了，不要去；或是那個山峯大峭了，不要去；不要拿鞋子弄濕了，）好像男人是三歳小孩子似的。所以這次克拉克蓋博祗約了多爾普醫生一個人同去的。</p>
<p>他们頭幾天快活極了。没有人告訴他们不好做這個，不好做那個，亦没有看着他们。他们眞是去所欲去，爲所欲爲，一　拘束。有時候打獵興致未盡，到深夜還不想回他们的帳幕。至於襪子濕不濕，以至於他们所常聽見的一切婆婆媽媽話，他们想來，還要大笑呢。</p>
<p>有一天他们回去大疲乏了。他们一天受了多少辛苦，遇了多少危險，並且還跋踄過幾條河。他们回到帳幕，混身是水是汗，要想換衣服。可是他们太疲倦了，他们躺在床上就睡着了。他们一睡已是好幾個鐘頭。等到他们醒來，夜已深了，天氣已冷了，他们覺得混身冰冷而潮濕。他们黨然不在乎一些小傷風小咳嗽。可是一些小傷風，小咳嗽，竟越入越深，顯見得寒氣　入肺裹面去了。到了明天天亮了，他们不能繼續打獵。於是他们就想回好萊塢，將身體養好，再來繼續他们的游興。</p>
<p>那位醫生還好，而克拉克蓋博到好萊塢的時候，他的背上幾處酸痛的地方。他躺在床上，痛處漸漸向下移。等到明天，他的兩隻脚都疼得不能動顫了。公司裹面不知道他的病狀，還打發人來請他繼續那將近拍完的Ｈold　Your　Man片子。克拉克蓋博立疾從公，咬緊了牙齒，忍了痛苦，將那將盡未完的幾幕，一氣拍完了。攝影機摇動着，克拉克掙扎着。等到戲完了，他人亦倒了。他的回家，係用病車抬回去的。</p>
<p>於是趕緊請了專家，用Ｘ光替他檢騐了身體的各部。結果診斷他除了傷寒等等病症之外，又添了盲腸炎的急症。可是病勢這樣，萬萬不能再開肚子。自從他的病狀傳了出來，好萊塢的全體，都被震動了。還有許多人，替他禱告，使他從速痊愈。可是這不是幾個禮拜可以復元的病。至少還要幾個月或半年，纔可以重入攝影塲也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（鵝池慘案）Ｔhe　Pengnin　Pool　Murder</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>每一個偵探片，差不多都是如此。主要的是以大人騙小孩子的手段，將劇情穿插得離奇曲折，疑雲密佈，使觀衆提心吊膽的來看着兇手爲誰。</p>
<p>這一部雷電華出品的（鵝池慘案）也是同樣，先行提出奸殺的疑竇，然後發現死屍，再由警察捉住幾個嫌疑犯，於是由於偵探之和一女敎員聰明的研究，而慢慢的尋得線索。不幸快要破案的時候，證人又遭慘殺。最後由女敎員之巧計，案情大白，原來兇手便是那替犯人辯護的律師。</p>
<p>記得派拉蒙出品的（千古奇案），也是這樣大體相同的，偵探殺人，反而施用其奇才雄辯，欲加罪於無辜。其相同處便是民權保障者的律師或偵探，反而爲殺人之兇手。</p>
<p>就這一方面來說，正是現代社社矛盾的暴露。假使劇作者的本意，正是以暴露爲主題，那末無疑義是很值得稱譽的。不過我们却認定劇作者之所以如此寫作劇本，無非是要使劇情離奇一些，新穎一些，企圖博得觀衆的喝采。因其如此，於是偵探和律師，便不免被他作爲譏笑的資料了。</p>
<p>然而在另一方面說，也許是劇作家要以此劇本對社會的負責者聊進忠言，希望對此矛盾現象有以改善。可是就（鵝池慘案）而言，却没有在苦諫的一點占强調起來，可以說是薄弱得很。何况這是現社會根本的矛盾，並不能因此輕言細語而消滅。所以作者的用心，終於吃力不討好。</p>
<p>上面說過，闗於偵探片的主要條件，這一影片是相當具備了的。但是整個的說來，導演對於劇情的處理，眞没有超越的力量。那末多的對話，在美國的人士看來，可以閉起眼睛當作Ｒadio來聽，給中國人聽來，却只好在劇塲裹打瞌睡。此外，所謂緊張之處，除了夜間奇怪的鳥聲，和法庭中的一刹那以外，其餘都是勉强得很，反而失了緊張的效用。</p>
<p>作者以Ｅdna　May　Oliver和James</p>
<p>Gleascon爲主角，自然是要二位的尷尬面孔，來使劇情生動。但是可惜得很。因着劇本的决定，終於不能生動起來。我们以爲這裹的角色没有那一個是值得特别稱讚的，和導演的手法一樣，整個的平庸。</p>
<p>最後，我们要說到的便是製作偵探片的社會根據。</p>
<p>現社會旣然如此腐敗，巳是無可掩飾的實情。誇耀粉飾己經没有可能，而暴露醜惡亦在所不忍。於是一方面來些農民意識的武俠作品，同時所謂偵探片也可以使觀衆無意識的消磨一些多餘的光陰。假使就此而顯示科學的進步，利用科學來破獲離奇的案情，那也是以科學爲畫面的點綴品而巳。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>（滿江紅）看後</h3>
<p>— 其然</p>
<p>以一本很長的舊體說部勉强地把牠緊縮成一個電影脚本，自然，處處都有失敗的危險：可是，這改編後的滿江紅，雖仍不免稍有生硬勉强的地方，却能出人意外的做到了相當的成就。這點，我想也許是脚本的編輯者和導演努力的結果吧。</p>
<p>我们都知道：舊小說的命脈大部分是依持了（有緣千里能相見）的（緣）字，自來佳人才子的相遇，都是因爲他们的（命）裹有（緣）。相逢之後，又必定是一見傾心。這部滿江紅是本舊體小說，所以對於這點也不能例外。如水村之與桃枝，處處都有（緣）在作怪。因爲（緣）太多了，就成了巧合：巧合太多了，就失眞實性，失了眞實性的作品，力量也就得微弱了。</p>
<p>這個時代是什麽時代！在這個時代裹，大家都呐喊着電影應該啓示走入迷途的出路。對這點，滿江紅是做到怎樣？牠啓示了走入迷途者的什魔出路麽？不，牠祇描寫了一些小資產者的偷懶，貪閑，儒弱和畏怯的劣性。雖則牠在結尾時很有意而勉强地使水村覺悟，可是，結果他仍不免爲苦悶而沈醉到死！</p>
<p>程步高在這裹是比（狂流）裹進步得許多。那種歡諧柔和的情調，增了觀衆很多趣味。牠能使觀衆坐了兩個鐘頭而不厭倦，確是不可多得的地方。</p>
<h3>（滿江红）的改編</h3>
<p>— 林丁</p>
<p>（上略）在這裹我想和改編劇本的王乾白先生，談一些改編原書的問題。　　這是一樣不可否認的事，假使看過原書的觀衆，對於銀幕上的滿江紅，幾乎會疑心這是類同的另外一件故事。當然，在長得有四厚本的小說，要想把都給搬運在幾千尺的膠片上，的確是一件難事。不過，我们旣然知道了困難，更不應該把原書的精彩，給忽略了過去。譬如說；原書的名是滿江紅，其要點便在歌舞團裹所表演的滿江紅，牽出後來輪船失火的結局顧全到全書命名的原意。可是在銀幕裹的滿江紅呢，幾乎使人看得有些文不對題了，我以爲編者對於這一層，無論如何都應當給插進去，寗可把萬有光等和桃枝來往，忍痛的縮短了些。因爲資本家玩弄女性，在萬有光和桃枝的立塲，已可使觀衆一目了然，旣然爲了片子上經濟，則比較捨此更妥　　在原書根本便没有意識可言，而改編者一方面捨不得那原書的題材，一方面又想把些新的意識灌進去，結果把滿江紅弄得全劇也散亂不堪。譬如說銀幕上的桃枝，是由資本家手裹掙扎出來了，而死到愛人懷裹去。這雖然比原書的桃枝沉溺後依然死了是有力，但一方面却無異告訴着一個人在没法應付現實時，只有迷糊的沉淪下去，而且更無異暗示着資本家的勢力，是無法應付的！本來滿江紅原書，祗可供給消遣，而没有編上劇本的可能的。在這裹我们可以領悟到改編劇本是如何艱難，尤其想把舊題材而給變了新的意識，是吃力不討好，而又容易錯誤的，王先生不知道亦引爲同情否？</p>
<h3>談談（飛絮）</h3>
<p>— 卓羣</p>
<p>（上略）嚴格的說：（飛絮）在演出最大的缺憾是因爲受着劇本的限止，缺少了戲劇的（力）。看完了這部影片，其印象猶如讀了一首詩。幸虧導演在這裹十分努力，把這樣一個Ｓtory佈置得非常嚴密。而且各部份演出的技巧，也不時顯出導演經騐底熟練。不過整個的劇情鬆懈，總覺得不能緊抓觀衆的心弦。倒是字幕給予了全劇不少帮助。有幾處戲劇力量不夠的闗節，全仗有力的說明織補張羅。所以就全片的形成說，總算還不怎樣討厭。</p>
<p>表演方面，袁美雲仍然不失是最成功的一個，牧牛時期的天眞活躍；做丫頭時期以及養媳婦時期的遭受凌虐，痛受世間給予的殘酷，每個表演都深刻動人，頗能引起觀者同情。王慧娟飾一個温和而無能的婦人，表演較（小女伶）中有進步。鮑志超做戲太生硬。其餘田方，吳一笑，陳綺霞，倉隠秋等均平平，佈景尙稱現實，攝影有幾處光線太暗，不過並無大礙，總結一句說：（飛絮）的演出似乎缺少了戲劇（的）但因（工作）方面有相當的成功，所以還（值得一觀）</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>小玩意（七）</h3>
<p>— 叢美</p>
<p>袁璞立起來告别，葉大嫂替他整理領帶，挽着　送他到門口。他說（以后或許要七八年才能再見了。最后我要說的話就是……因爲我是一個人，所以應盡我對於國家的義務。……但是，同時也因爲我長了一個心，我也要永遠地愛件！）</p>
<p>葉大嫂痴痴不動，微笑着，涙水却在眼裹波湧。袁璞是走了，他很勇敢地走了。她流着涙，斜倚在門口，隻身孤影，倍增悽切！</p>
<p>無疑的，葉大嫂是受着剌激，她退到屋子裹去，脚是那樣輕軟無力，精神是那樣頽喪着。當她坐下的時候，她限内的苦涙像珍珠般的滾了出來。（爲什麽人人要長一個心呢？）她指着自己的心悽　地說。</p>
<p>珠兒進來看見媽媽在哭，就投入她的懷抱，呌她不要哭（媽媽！……小傻子才哭呢！）珠兒用小指承着媽媽的涙珠，向那泥和尙彈去，於是她倆都笑了。</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>一片蒼茫的黑夜，火車在遠處進行着。袁璞是從黑暗中奔個他的光明的前程！這時候，那殘燈未媳的一間破房裹，寂靜無聲。老葉像死猪樣的酣睡。玉兒在夢裹微笑。珠兒緊緊依住母懷。葉大嫂呢？她却張大了眼睛，半夜不能成眠。她望着天花板出神，她彷彿聽見那轆轆車輪的聲音；她彷彿看見袁璞的影子。她的芳心是擾亂了。她只有在沉寂空氣裹偷偷地淌着涙滴！</p>
<p>春天再來，又是一年。在那曙光初曉的刹那，湖山依舊是那樣的美麗。但是那暖和的春風那能吹得到生活日就貧困的老葉家中。什麽也都變了啊！老葉穿着破衣，人也病了，咳嗽喘氣，樣子是更漸地可憐！</p>
<p>（珠兒的爸爸！剛才是你在咳嗽嗎？……）葉大嫂聽見咳嗽，躭心他的病又發了。</p>
<p>（没有！……我近來身體好得多哪！）裝出笑容來說。葉大嫂是昏昏地睡了；但是却被悲酸侵襲住他的靈魂！　　（未完）</p>

<h3>National and Municipal Governments Lower Flags to Mourn Deceased Compatriots</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning at 8:00 on the 18th, the Central Government held its 96th weekly memorial service, concurrently commemorating the second anniversary of the September 18th Incident. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Guofu, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Gongbo, Zhu Peide, He Yaozu, Zhu Jiahua, Ding Chaowu, Jiao Yitang, Zeng Zhongming, and other central figures, as well as representatives from various central institutions, totaling over 600 people. Chairman Wang and Wu Jingheng delivered speeches, briefly stating: "Today we are holding the Premier's weekly memorial service while simultaneously commemorating the second anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The significance of this event is something we all understand clearly. Two years ago today, the Japanese attacked Shenyang with violence and continued to occupy our four northeastern provinces. These atrocities are still vivid in our minds. This is something everyone sympathizes with. Today, we are holding a sorrowful national humiliation memorial service. In a few days, our National Day will arrive, a day that can be described as universally joyful. Honestly, we have quite a few memorial days. Since the founding of the Republic, regarding Japan, there have been similar memorial days such as May 3rd, May 7th, and May 9th. However, we didn't have many memorial days before. Since the failures of Chinese diplomacy, from the Opium War, through the Boxer Rebellion, to the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, we have failed every time, and each time we have been left crestfallen. On June 25th of the Jiawu Year (1894), Japan suddenly sank our merchant ship in the Bohai Sea, initiating hostilities. After suffering this major blow, why did we have to suffer another blow from Japan two years ago today? It's because we haven't implemented the Premier's ideas. Today, let's look at the couplet hanging in the auditorium. The first line is 'Promote the national spirit,' and the second line is 'Strengthen the national power.' Now, our national spirit has been roused, but strengthening the national power is something we haven't been able to achieve. At the time, the Premier saw that the arousal of the national spirit was important, but he also saw that strengthening the national power was equally important. Therefore, the Premier, a year before the Jiawu War, wrote to Li Hongzhang and proposed three points: (1) Utilize the land to its fullest extent, (2) Utilize resources to their fullest extent, (3) Facilitate the flow of goods. These are the most important steps to strengthen national power. However, now these three points of the Premier have not been implemented at all. Therefore, everyone is worried about poverty, and there is a phenomenon of bankruptcy in rural areas across the country. Strengthening national power is even less possible. Therefore, the purpose of holding this memorial service today is not in the form of sorrow and fervor, but in the hope that all our people will work together with one heart, following the spirit of the martyrs' perseverance and striving to realize the Premier's legacy, so as to achieve the goal of utilizing the land to its fullest extent, utilizing resources to their fullest extent, and facilitating the flow of goods. Only then will the national power inevitably be strengthened, and only after the national power is strengthened will our humiliation definitely be washed away." (Central Government's official telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Lin and Dai Give Speeches at the National Government</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin gave a speech at the National Government's weekly memorial service on the 18th ("To wipe away disgrace, we must act, not just engage in formalities"). He briefly stated that commemorating the painful national humiliation requires being grounded and working hard in practical positions, sacrificing all personal interests, and dedicating personal effort, wealth, and spirit to the country in order to practice diligently and achieve the goal of wiping away disgrace. We should endure humiliation, bear heavy burdens, and learn from past sufferings, and only by doing things practically can we live up to the true meaning of commemoration. (Central News Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, the 18th, the National Government held a weekly memorial service. Attending were Lin Sen, Dai Jitao, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Jiahua, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 400 National Government staff members. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, followed by Dai's speech ("How to Save the Nation"), which briefly stated that today is the second anniversary of the September 18th Incident. While we are deeply saddened, we should think of ways to achieve the goal of saving the nation. There are many ways to save the nation, such as saving the nation through morality, saving the nation through education, and saving the nation through industry. Recently, there have also been so-called aviation movements and thrift movements. The former's motive lies in national defense and transportation construction. In the future, we should find ways to fundamentally enhance national power and not just know how to buy airplanes from foreign countries. As for the thrift movement, we must both passively save wasteful expenses and actively use money for productive purposes. In this time of national crisis, we should each do our best in our own positions and implement the entire Three Principles of the People based on the Premier's consistent policies. (Central News Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Beijing Circles Pass Five Resolutions</h3>

<h3>Jiang Zuobin Visits Wang to Request Instructions on Diplomatic Policy Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Releases Statement in Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This afternoon, the 18th, Jiang Zuobin visited Wang to request instructions on his return to Japan to resume his post. Jiang said that two years ago, when he was chatting with Hirota, Hirota said that if he were to become foreign minister, he would do his best to seek the welfare of both countries in order to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship. This may have been just a social remark, but he and the Premier were also close friends and expressed sympathy for our party. However, whether he is sincere in seeking peace depends entirely on future developments. I am planning to stay in Nanjing for four or five days before going to Shanghai to wait for a boat to go east because the government has repeatedly urged me to return. The rumors that the government is yielding to Japanese threats and moving towards compromise are groundless. I dare to believe that no one in power would be so insane as to sacrifice national sovereignty and destroy their own nation. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Attempts to Occupy Various Passes of the Great Wall for a Long Time, Citing the Reason of Maintaining Transportation and Communication Lines. Our Side Is Currently Negotiating.</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the signing of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, our army gradually demobilized, but the Japanese army maintained a wartime state. Therefore, hidden dangers still lurk in the situation in North China. The Japanese army has not yet withdrawn from various passes of the Great Wall and counties such as Miyun and Linyu. The reason they hold is to maintain transportation and communication lines. The Japanese army stationed in Miyun is to protect the transportation of grain between Pinggu, the Japanese army stationed in Xifengkou is to protect the transportation of the Luan River, and the Japanese army stationed in Yu Guan is to protect the transportation inside and outside the pass. Because the transportation of grain from Rehe is inconvenient and time-consuming, the Japanese army stated that it is necessary to maintain the communication lines. Our side believes that since the war zone has been taken over, the various passes of the Great Wall should be recovered. The Japanese army's transportation of grain can be protected by our side. We are currently negotiating with the Japanese side, requesting them to withdraw the stationed troops from each pass. The Receiving Committee is actively handling the banditry situation in various counties of the war zone. The authorities have not yet received a formal report that Yu Guan was forcibly划劃ed by the Japanese army into the scope of the puppet state. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Promoting Homespun Cloth Truly</h3>
<p>Promoting homespun cloth in Shanghai, a place full of Western fashion and Westernization, has achieved unprecedented rare success. The homespun cloth exhibition has aroused great excitement among Shanghai citizens. The grand occasion of the meeting and the enthusiastic participation have not only attracted the serious attention of the domestic industrial community but also aroused the interest of the general public. From now on, the homespun cloth industry may gradually develop, and it is not known whether this will provide a way for our country's semi-colonial economic situation to be reborn. As for the use of homespun cloth, old-fashioned agrarian economic idealists in our country all hoped for self-sufficiency in rural areas, believing that a peaceful world lies in farming and weaving, and that the way to wealth lies in cultivating for food and weaving for clothing. The so-called "every family has enough" is what they are about. Although the production of cotton is limited by weather and geology, the diligence of the people is enough to meet their needs even with a moderate harvest. Moreover, in the past, every farming family had a spinning wheel. In the winter, when farmers were idle, women engaged in spinning. In the spring, when it was warm, they started weaving cloth. If there were no major political disturbances or major droughts, the harmonious state of the countryside would indeed be no different from an ideal utopia. Recently, capitalism, carrying cheap goods, has crossed the sea and come east. Machine-made goods have broken through our country's rural dikes and shattered the dream of self-sufficiency. The social organization of the handicraft industry has been fundamentally shaken by this, and it is heading towards collapse. For the past fifty years, our country has been wandering on this path where it cannot advance and is not easy to retreat, with no way to extricate itself. Although this situation is felt by the early capitalist society in our country to be a serious current situation, the seriousness of the situation in countries where capitalism has reached the point of excessive maturity and economic panic has not been less than that in China.</p>
<p>Since the convening of the World Economic Conference in June of this year, pure isolationism has clearly run into a wall. If it continues like this, there is no second way but to die. Therefore, the idea of international cooperation has been valued by countries around the world. Major countries are also eagerly hoping that the World Economic Conference can find some compromise points to ease the world's economic panic and achieve a slight balance in the current situation. However, the boundaries between countries cannot be erased after all, and the ill will between nations remains fierce. The struggle between aggression and resistance is still accelerating. Therefore, even this extremely abstract principle cannot be achieved at the World Economic Conference. Economic nationalism has instead been uplifted. The industrial recovery plan of the United States of America, the so-called "Blue Eagle Revolution" movement, is one example.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency was originally an extremely closed and conservative policy in the agricultural society of the past, and its meaning was limited to one family and one clan, and at most only to one country. Unlike today's developed transportation, the relationship between countries has changed from simple to complex, and it is impossible for any country to achieve absolute isolationism. Countries like China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and England, which have wider territories, larger populations, and more abundant natural resources, may not have to rely on overseas countries for major commodities. However, it is still impossible to be absolutely self-sufficient. Moreover, the interpretation of the so-called economic alliance and national self-sufficiency by advanced countries is not that they do not sell their own products or buy foreign products, but that they strive to promote exports and prevent imports of foreign goods with all their strength. Its main purpose is to base on economic organization, but the goal is military preparation in wartime. This kind of situation was only done by Japan a year and a half ago, but now both the United Kingdom and the United States are catching up quickly, trying to realize the entire implementation of this policy.</p>
<p>Our country's handicraft civilization in the agricultural society was indeed advanced, but it is extremely lacking in the qualities of self-sufficiency with mechanical industry in modern social organizations. It can be asserted that it will inevitably encounter unprecedented difficulties in opening up an economic path among the surrounded countries. However, do we not see India today? Gandhi, unarmed and carrying a spinning wheel, can still use his historical power and give full play to his personal strengths to contend with British rule. Is it more difficult for our country to promote homespun cloth than for Gandhi? However, we have great hopes for the promotion of homespun cloth in rural areas, but in industrial areas, we should understand the collapse of the spinning industry in rural areas. Only by using mechanical spinning as raw materials for weaving homespun cloth can we solve the current difficulties of the yarn industry's unsaleable inventory and open up new avenues in the country, which will be of great help to the future of homespun cloth.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</p>
<h3>Releases Statement</h3>
<p>No Concrete Decisions on Cotton and Wheat Sales Yet</p>
<p>I Have No Preconceived Opinions on the Powers of the Economic Commission</p>
<p>There Are Already Ways to Cope with the Financial Situation in North China</p>
<p>We Will Definitely Do Our Best to Raise Funds for River Disaster Relief</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen, accompanied by his secretary Chen Fengyi and his wife Ms. Zhang Leyi, as well as his two daughters, returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the Customs' Meteor patrol ship. He arrived at Xiaguan at 1:00 p.m. on the 18th and landed at the Sanbei Wharf. He then took a car to his private residence in Beijige to rest. At 3:00 p.m., he met with Li Diaosheng, Zou and others. Song said that the issue of sales of American cotton and wheat is still under discussion with business circles in Shanghai and has not yet been concretely decided. In the future, they will be imported into China in urgent batches according to the needs of the domestic market, with the primary principle of not affecting domestic cotton and wheat production. The Economic Commission has been established for two years, and now it will only slightly expand its internal organization. In the future, I have no preconceived opinions on issues such as expanding the powers of the commission. Everything will be decided by Wang. The financial deficit in North China is very large. I have already discussed coping methods with Huang Fu in Shanghai. The four million yuan for the Yellow River flood relief funds is most difficult to raise at this time of empty national treasury, but it is a matter of life and death, so no matter how difficult it is, we should find a way to prevent the victims in several provinces from being displaced. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Ziwen arrived at the Sanbei Wharf in Xiaguan at 1:00 p.m. on the 18th on the Customs' Meteor patrol ship. Jinling Customs Commissioner Osbborne and several news reporters were waiting at the riverside to greet him. After Song disembarked, he returned to his private residence to rest. When Song landed, he told reporters that he went to Shanghai from Lu to plan the expanded organization of the Economic Commission and the allocation of funds for the cotton and wheat loan, and to exchange views with various circles in Shanghai. The detailed allocation of the loan funds should be planned by the Economic Commission in accordance with the principles set by the Central Government. As for the selection of personnel for the supervisory body, it has not been agreed upon in Shanghai. After arriving in Nanjing, I will discuss it with President Wang before asking the Central Government to decide. The members of the Economic Commission have long been appointed by the government. Whether there will be any additions or changes will be decided by the Central Government, and I have no opinion. As for the relief work of the Yellow River Relief Association, in addition to sending various directors to inspect the disaster areas, I will do my best to plan and save the victims.

<p>Hirota Will Devote Full Efforts</p>
<p>To Dealing With Diplomacy Towards China</p>
<p>Orders Asia Bureau Director, Sangashima, to Draft an Outline</p>
<p>Abandoning the Policy of Quiet Observation</p>
<p>Adopting a Proactive Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) How will Japan's diplomatic policy change after Hirota becomes Foreign Minister? This is attracting much attention from both domestic and foreign parties. It is a matter of course that the new Foreign Minister will strive for the overall development of diplomacy and rebuild international relations. However, based on the opinions he has expressed formally and informally since taking office, it is known that the Foreign Minister intends to devote his full efforts to the development of Sino-Japanese relations. Hirota believes that China and Japan have a special relationship, and that improving relations between the two countries is an urgent issue that cannot be hesitated. Therefore, before becoming Foreign Minister, he planned to go to China alone, but this move could not be realized because he took office as Foreign Minister. However, he first ordered the Asia Bureau Director to draft a general outline of diplomatic policy towards China. It is heard that the fundamental policy is as follows: Since the Manchurian Incident, diplomacy towards China has adopted a policy of quiet observation. Today, this established policy is still insisted upon. However, recently, the League of Nations' cooperation with China and the activities of other countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States towards China have gradually intensified. For the sake of self-defense, Japan should abandon the policy of quiet observation and adopt a proactive attitude. The Empire's new policy towards China is not the old policy of compromise or the so-called transaction diplomacy of exchanging favors for rights by the United Kingdom and the United States. It is a policy that makes China, for its own benefit and happiness, automatically change its current attitude towards Japan. Therefore, the new Foreign Minister's policy towards China is different from that of previous Foreign Ministers and can be said to be a unprecedented and rejuvenated diplomacy.

<h3>Soviet Russia Expands Far East Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Deployment of Heavy Troops and Aircraft Arouses Attention of Japanese Military Authorities</p>
<p>Hirota Considers Countermeasures, Seeks to Gradually Resolve Crisis Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russia has recently been simultaneously working to strengthen its military in the Far East due to the stagnation of negotiations. It is reported that Soviet Russia has deployed a wartime force of thirty divisions from the northern Manchurian border to Vladivostok, and has also deployed more than twenty ultra-heavy bombers in key locations. This air force includes major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, as well as important Manchurian cities such as Changchun and Shenyang, within its range of operations. Furthermore, it has completed the construction of twelve submarines in Vladivostok, which can completely block the route from Najin to the Japanese mainland. The fact that Soviet Russia is expanding its military preparations in the Far East cannot be explained as merely for defense, and the Japanese military is paying close attention to this. However, the new Foreign Minister Hirota, as an expert on Soviet Russia, is considering various countermeasures against Russia, first seeking to gradually resolve the crisis between Japan and Russia. On the one hand, he will mediate a satisfactory resolution of the China Eastern Railway negotiations, and on the other hand, he will fully explain that Japan is not harboring any ambitions and that everything is a fantasy depicted by Soviet Russia itself, requesting Soviet Russia to reflect.

<h3>Hirota Calls on Foreign Envoys</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota visited the leader of the diplomatic corps in Japan, Brazilian Ambassador Amaral, as well as the ambassadors, ministers, or chargés d'affaires of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries at 2:00 PM on the 18th as a formality of taking office.

<h3>Japan Consults on Fundamental National Defense Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the fundamental national defense policy, the three ministers, Takahashi, Araki, and Osumi, held consultations. The focus of their discussions was as follows: (1) After the effect of withdrawing from the League of Nations in 1935 takes place, it is necessary to urgently seek the implementation of naval replenishment funding to prepare for the defense of the South Seas and to prepare for the revision of the Washington and London Treaties of 1936; (2) Maintain the Manchurian military force sufficient to maintain the security of (Manchukuo); (3) Strengthen military preparations to prepare for the expansion of the powers of various countries in China and the advance of Soviet Russia; (4) Regarding the strengthening of military preparations, the limits of military industrial capacity; (5) The harmony between national defense strengthening and financial establishment; (6) If the financial resources are limited, the urgency of national defense plan funding. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When compiling the national defense budget for next year, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the development of the international situation, intends to emphasize the naval budget. As for the items related to equipment maintenance in the army budget, those that can be completed quickly are planned to be postponed to later years. The army is absolutely opposed to this for the following reasons: The equipment maintenance fee of 200 million yuan budgeted for next year is 200 million yuan out of the remaining 249 million yuan in continuing fees from Showa 9 (1934). It is only a request for next year's budget. The request for capital equipment maintenance fees since Taisho 10 (1921) has already been postponed financially, and there has been experience in the Manchurian Incident that these capital materials cannot be completed quickly. Because the army's attitude is quite strong, the army expects that the Ministry of Finance will definitely approve most of the capital equipment maintenance fees. (Dentsu Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>The May 15th Incident Will Be Sentenced Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tomorrow, the presiding judge of the Army Military Tribunal will read out the main text and reasoning of the judgment for the defendants in the May 15th Incident and announce the judgment.

If the defendant or prosecutor is dissatisfied with the judgment, they can appeal within five days. However, all defendants have declared that they will obey any severe punishment ordered by national law, so if there is no appeal from the prosecutor, the military tribunal can be concluded. After the judgment, the defendants' military status will be stripped, and they will be handed over from the Army Garrison Prison to civilian prisons. (Japan United Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>(Dalian) The Japanese financial groups in Manchuria initially thought that occupying Manchuria could solve Japan's economic panic. Therefore, after the Japanese army began military operations in Manchuria, they were all excited and praised the military. Today, two years later, they realize that although they have gained Manchuria, they have lost the entire Chinese market, which is ultimately useless. Japanese goods with overproduction still have no way out. It is reported that the South Manchuria Railway Company, through several board meetings, has decided to change its policy and enter the mainland of China to find its own way out. Choosing the date of the second anniversary of the Manchurian Incident, it will expand its scope of activities. The specific measures are as follows: (1) Expand the South Manchuria Railway offices in Beiping and Shanghai, increase personnel, and develop new businesses; (2) Increase the number of South Manchuria Railway employees stationed in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, and expand their scope of work; (3) The Japan-Manchu Economic Alliance cannot solve the Japanese economic crisis, and it will also cause the Manchurian economy to fall into unrest. Therefore, the directors should take turns going to Tianjin, Beiping, Shanghai and Nanjing to seek ways to approach Chinese capitalists and seek to save the economic crisis of Japan and Manchuria. It is reported that Director Sogo will be sent to Shanghai on orders. (China Union Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Great Navy Advocates Equal U.S.-British Navies</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Navy League, which usually advocates for a large navy and holds power in political circles, is now re-launching a movement to achieve complete equality between the U.S. and British navies and to determine naval plans. Its chairman, Herbert, stated today that although the government has finally decided that arms reduction has become impossible in practice, a strong navy is a guarantee of peace. However, there has never been an overall plan for shipbuilding. Currently, many parties point out that the United States has begun a shipbuilding competition, which is completely unfounded. Because even the ships built by the United States this time are still insufficient compared to other countries that have already completed the shipbuilding process. He and his colleagues all believe that the United States should urgently develop a program for many years after the expiration of the Washington and London Treaties. Without a concrete plan, the U.S. Navy will be relegated to third place. It is ridiculous to say that the United States has begun a shipbuilding competition, because since the European War, the United States has only built or started building 42 warships. In contrast, the United Kingdom has 84 ships, France 149 ships, Italy 126 ships, and Japan 175 ships. The United States is currently still 121 ships short of what is stipulated by the London Treaty. Of course, the aforementioned numbers include many small ships, but the United States is still behind in shipbuilding. Mr. Herbert also discussed the suspicion of Japanese officials that the United States has begun a naval competition, saying that Japan is currently only 7 ships short of what is stipulated by the London Treaty.

<p>British-French Arms Reduction Talks Begin</p>
<p>Aims to Establish a Foundation for a Common Policy</p>
<p>Davis Travels Between England and France</p>
<p>After Listening to the German Foreign Minister's Remarks</p>
<p>French Public Opinion Becomes Increasingly Strong</p>
<p>(Paris) British Deputy Foreign Secretary Eden hopes to use a secret document related to Germany's rearmament, as pointed out by France, to establish a foundation for a common arms reduction policy before going to Geneva. Therefore, he met with French Prime Minister Daladier at the French Foreign Ministry today. It is heard that Eden persuaded the French Prime Minister to slightly reduce armaments to show his attitude towards Germany. It is expected that the British-French talks will last for two days. After that, Eden may go to Rome for similar talks. It is generally believed that Eden's talks with the French Prime Minister are extremely important, because Geneva will either see the success of the arms reduction conference within the next month, or see the resumption of the arms reduction competition. However, what is undeniable is that since German Foreign Minister Neurath made a statement that there is no way to prevent the collapse of the arms reduction conference other than equality in armaments, French public opinion has become increasingly strong. The basic principles of France are (1) Germany must not rearm; (2) France will not reduce armaments for five years to ensure that Germany does not break its promises; (3) Universal international management of armaments. Approximately the only point that France can concede is the trial period for Germany. It is heard that the United Kingdom is now persuading France to allow a reduction in armaments equal to Germany at the end of this trial period. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) American arms reduction representative Davis had a long conversation with Prime Minister MacDonald today. Mr. Davis handed over a letter from President Roosevelt to the British Prime Minister and said that President Roosevelt has always considered economic recovery as a prerequisite, and even if it is necessary to make slight sacrifices when implementing any practical arms reduction measures, the United States is determined to cooperate with all countries. Mr. Davis will also present President Roosevelt's letter to French Prime Minister Daladier, but its content will be very different from the letter to MacDonald. Davis left London at 11:00 AM today. Upon departure, he declared that he had not yet made any preparations for meeting with representatives of the French government, but he may participate in the Paris arms reduction talks when the British-French consultations have made considerable progress. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express claims that British Deputy Foreign Secretary Eden, who is currently in Paris in contact with key figures in the French government regarding arms reduction, was ordered by the British government to warn the French Prime Minister not to publish the French document at the arms reduction conference. Therefore, the British government advised him to be cautious because the United Kingdom is well aware of the danger of this move. The newspaper believes that if the French Prime Minister is willing to listen to Eden's advice, the document will still be placed in the secret safe of the French Foreign Ministry. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Talks between Britain and France on arms reduction issues, especially on the issue of arms monitoring, began at 11:00 AM today at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Representing the British side were Deputy Foreign Secretary Eden, British Ambassador to France Tyrrell, Director of the League of Nations Affairs Bureau of the British Foreign Office Cadogan, and Eden's secretary Enkana. Representing the French side were Foreign Minister Pongou, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Le Roy, and the French permanent representative to the League of Nations Massigli. The talks ended at noon, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted a banquet for Eden. The Hungarian Foreign Minister Gania, who is currently in Paris, was also invited to the banquet, and Prime Minister Daladier accompanied them. The British-French talks will resume in the afternoon, and Prime Minister Daladier will also attend. The talks are expected to last for two days. American arms reduction representative Davis will arrive in Paris today. Therefore, Davis can attend the second day of talks. The main point of the talks is to present various viewpoints on the issue of arms monitoring for mutual reference. If the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, can reach an agreement in principle on the international arms monitoring system, it will be easier to find a solution even if there are slight differences of opinion on the details. This attempt will be continued when the League of Nations Council meets on September 22. There are still several weeks to use before the arms reduction conference reopens on October 16 to resolve this issue. (Havas Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Cuban Provisional President Implements Dictatorial Power</h3>
<p>Orders Protection of American Nationals and Dissolves All Political Parties</p>
<p>Negotiations With Opposition Leaders Fail</p>
<p>Havana Cuba is now ruled by a dictator. President Grau San Martin has dissolved all political parties and refused to meet with opposition leaders. Although the new government has ordered the protection of American nationals and denies a anti-American policy, anti-American sentiment in the country is increasing rapidly, especially among workers. Agitators are telling strikers and those returning to work that if they can express anti-American sentiment, the United States will be concerned and intervention can be avoided. Therefore, in the southern region where American investment is the largest, disturbances are even more intense. Striking workers often surround American factories and demand that foreigners leave the country. Although there has been no public attack on American nationals, the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. The anti-Spanish sentiment seems to have completely disappeared, so American Ambassador Wells is deeply worried. Today, Mr. Wells went to the Presidential Palace and talked with the Cuban President for nearly two hours. The content was not allowed to be disclosed. The Cuban government's order to dissolve political parties was issued after Mr. Wells entered the palace for talks, because the Cuban President still failed to reach an agreement after summoning the leaders of various opposition parties for a meeting on Saturday. Therefore, the action of dissolving the political parties was taken. As for Havana, the capital, the order has always been good since the new president took power. This is also a powerful reason for the new government to demand immediate de facto recognition from the United States. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Havana It is still impossible to know what the trend of Cuban politics will be after the first meeting between the Cuban government and the opposition party. According to some sources, the opposition still demands that President San Martin resign. However, opposition figures only said after the meeting, "(The political crisis will be resolved soon)". It is now heard that the meeting will continue tomorrow. Currently, the government is preparing to dissolve the Liberal Party and the People's Conservative Party, and will grant voting rights to women to gain the support of the women's world. It is heard that American Ambassador Wells has held the first meeting with President San Martin, but both parties have remained silent about the content of the talks. The Cuban government is now also working to quell the strike movement. It is heard that it plans to expel foreign communist instigators and eliminate the party to prevent its propaganda from becoming a dangerous force. The communist side is also preparing to organize a Red Guard in a certain sugar refinery, and a Soviet has been established in the Manchinerinho area, but it has been immediately dissolved. According to reports, the Cuban people do not have communist ideas, but instigators are distributing Marxist leaflets in Cuba to promote communism. (Havas Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>Dublin, 17th (Reuters) - The Blue Shirts paraded in Celse today, commencing the campaign of the Irish Unity Party. General O'Duffy and Cosgrave, MacDermott, and Dillon stood on the platform to review the parade.

<h3>Gran Chaco Becomes a Battlefield</h3>
<p>Paraguay and Bolivia Are Well-Matched</p>
<p>Both Sides Claim Victories</p>
<p>Asunción, 17th (National News Agency) - Although the Paraguayan government issued a statement today expressing its desire for an honorable peace, it also ordered the mobilization of reserve soldiers from 1934 onward, to be mobilized next month to continue the Gran Chaco War. Currently, the Paraguayan Ministry of the Army is busy with the mobilization and transporting ammunition and supplies to the front lines. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still studying the recent ceasefire proposal put forward by the neutral committee composed of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru, and stated that the Paraguayan government's policy regarding peace efforts has not changed. As soon as both sides agree to the peace proposal, the war will be stopped. However, regarding the neutral committee's proposal for an immediate ceasefire, troop withdrawal, and then discussing peace terms, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs personnel only said they are studying it and declined to comment. At this time, on the Gran Chaco front, because both sides want to determine a victor before the rainy season arrives, there is fierce fighting along the entire line. Both sides claim victory. Bolivian news reports that the Bolivian army, under the command of German General Kundt, has repelled the attacking Paraguayan army. Today, the Paraguayan government's war report also claimed to have annihilated four regiments of Bolivian elite troops. In other battles, although they have lasted for years, both sides are evenly matched and have not been able to occupy any area for long. The entire Gran Chaco region has become a battlefield.</p>

<p>Slight Hull Damage and Leakage; Shiratori's Trip to the US Postponed</p>
<p>Yokohama - Chang Hing Company's "Kaho" sent a wireless message yesterday stating that it was returning due to engine damage and has entered the port this morning. It is learned that the ship encountered a gale 500 miles out to sea, which blew off a piece of iron plating, causing significant water leakage into the ship.

After collective discussions of the Guangdong merchants from Hong Kong and Guangdong, they objected, and the monitored rice was released at 3:00 PM on the 18th without being taxed. However, according to the Finance Department, taxing imported rice is inevitable. The entire province will be divided into five tax bureaus in Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Meizhou, Wuyi, Qinzhou, Lianzhou, and Qiongya to collect taxes. The price of rice in Guangdong has increased by about one yuan per dan. (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) - Although the customs authorities have not formally announced the implementation of the special tax on imported rice after the Guangdong authorities announced it, the tax bureau personnel have already been designated, and the grain transported to the province is being monitored by the Finance Department to prevent unloading. Rice merchants in Hong Kong and Guangdong believe that the tax rate of one dollar per dan will have a significant impact on people's livelihoods, because Guangdong Province cannot produce enough rice to meet its own needs and must rely on supplies from Southeast Asia. In addition, there are occasional shortages of local rice, and exports have been banned. At the same time, imported rice is subject to customs duties, resulting in a lack of supply and a sharp increase in rice prices in the interior. The Annam Rice Company in Hong Kong held a large meeting at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss how to resolve the tax crisis. As a result, they first telegraphed the Guangdong authorities to immediately stop collecting the tax, otherwise they will contact rice merchants from Hong Kong and Guangdong to launch a large-scale opposition movement. Currently, the price of rice in Guangdong has suddenly increased by 80 cents per dan, because the rice that has been transported in recent days cannot be unloaded. (Central News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>Northeast Anti-Japanese Army Bloody Battle at Xilin River</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops in Northern Manchuria Restrained by Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Retreat in Battle of Xilin River</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Recently, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army has been actively preparing for war with Japanese and Russian troops in northern Manchuria. The majority of Japanese and puppet troops have been transferred to important locations such as Manzhouli and Hailun, believing that there is an opportunity to take advantage. After occupying Sandangang on the 3rd of this month, the Japanese troops were quite alarmed. At the same time, due to the increasingly serious military situation in northern Manchuria, they did not take an offensive stance against the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army, but only defended. On the 7th of this month, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army convened a meeting of military officers and decided to take the opportunity to advance along the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is also reported that the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army recently purchased five fighter planes from a certain country. The pilots are said to be Russian, and the planes provide cover during combat. Moreover, the organization and training of the troops are more effective than those of the former Northeast Army, and they have greater combat capabilities. The Japanese and puppet troops feel quite uneasy. On the 8th of this month, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army attacked Xilin River Station. They made contact with the Japanese army about 50 miles from the station. Both sides charged and engaged in close combat, fighting fiercely for a day and night. The morale of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army grew stronger. They used heavy artillery to cover the attack. At about 9:00 PM that night, they secretly entered the Japanese army's defenses. The Japanese army's defenses were slightly weaker at night, so they scattered in confusion and were in a very embarrassing situation. As a result, more than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the defense line was completely broken. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese troops retreated to Maqiaohe and urgently telegraphed the Changchun Command for reinforcements. It is reported that the number of troops in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Army has now reached more than 80,000. (Northeast Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Suddenly Fly Over Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Zhao Dengyu's Division Enters Guyuan</p>
<p>Japan Forces Song's Troops to Withdraw from Eastern Chahar</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Zhao Dengyu's division of Song Zheyuan's 29th Army, due to bandit disturbances in the Guyuan area (more than ten li outside Dushikou), causing hardship for the people, and in order to maintain law and order, dispatched troops to the vicinity of Guyuan city on the morning of the 13th. The puppet army of Li Shouxin immediately retreated north. On the 14th, Zhao's troops entered Guyuan. Prior to this, He Yingqin, acting chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, had met with Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, to explain the situation, stating that the Chahar provincial army intended to enter Guyuan to suppress bandits but would not advance further north, requesting their understanding. Shibayama replied that the Chinese government had the right to deal with the bandits in Chahar Province, and he would inform the Kwantung Army of the matter. However, as soon as Zhao's division arrived in Guyuan, Japanese planes flew from the southeast to the sky above Zhangjiakou, circling for more than twenty minutes and dropping many leaflets with absurd wording. Among them was a so-called warning letter, the full text of which is as follows: (According to the provisions of the Sino-Japanese Truce Agreement, the extension line of Changping and Yanqing, that is, the area east of Longguan and Zhangbei, is where Chinese troops should not enter without authorization, as this is a clear violation of the agreement. Recently, it has been heard that Song Zheyuan's troops have successively entered the area east of this line without regard for the spirit of the truce agreement. It is hoped that said troops will change their attitude and quickly withdraw their infantry to the west of the Changping-Yanqing-Longguan-Zhangbei line. Otherwise, the Japanese (Manchukuo) armies, in order to maintain the spirit of the truce agreement, will inevitably take decisive measures, not only attacking said troops, but also bombing Zhangjiakou, the source of their strategy. Should other important relations arise as a result, the responsibility for this will rest entirely with Song Zheyuan's army. This needs no further explanation. This is a special declaration and warning, Kwantung Army Resident Officer in Chengde, Matsumuro Takayoshi.) The Japanese planes then flew towards Chengde. Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Chahar provincial government, went to Tianjin to visit his family a few days ago. After receiving a report from the Chahar provincial government, he took the Beining train to Beiping on the evening of the 15th. According to Song, he went to Tianjin to visit his family and was not very familiar with the Japanese planes reconnaissance of Zhangjiakou. The bandit army of Li Shouxin in Duolun and Guyuan harassed the local area, and everyone should punish them. Zhao Dengyu's division implemented suppression in order to maintain law and order and purely to pacify the people, with no other intention. He just heard Qin (Dechun), the chief of staff, report that the Japanese planes intended to bomb Zhangjiakou, and this matter should be negotiated with the Japanese side by the government. He himself would visit Chairman He on the 16th and return to Chahar on the 18th. If necessary, he could also depart earlier. After He Yingqin received a report from Yang Zhennan, the secretary-general of the Chahar provincial government, he summoned Qin Dechun, the director of the Chahar Civil Affairs Department, and Xiong Bin, etc., around 4 p.m. on the 15th to discuss the matter. In addition to preparing to lodge a protest with the Japanese side, in order to avoid the situation escalating, he had telegraphed Zhao Dengyu's division to stop in Guyuan and await orders. At the same time, he ordered Yin Tong, a receiving commissioner, to negotiate with Yano Shin, the acting representative of the Japanese Embassy in China, and Lieutenant Colonel Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy. Yin Jing went to the Japanese Embassy to visit Shibayama to inquire about the truth and asked the Kwantung Army to find a way to prevent sending planes to Zhangjiakou again. Shibayama promised to forward our views to the Kwantung Army and Matsumuro. Yano Shin, the Japanese acting representative, also visited Chairman He on the 16th at 11 a.m. at Jurentang, accompanied by Harada Ryuichi, a Chinese counselor, explaining that Japan had no intention of expanding the situation. The reason why Matsumuro sent planes to Zhangjiakou to distribute leaflets was probably to prevent Song's troops from intending to advance east. Chairman He then explained again that our side had already notified them of the bandit suppression in advance, and Yano then withdrew.</p>
<p>At present, in eastern Chahar, Zhao Dengyu's troops have already entered Guyuan, and the local troops of Li Shouxin and Suo Huachen, and more than a thousand miscellaneous troops, have retreated to Duolun. Yao Jingchuan is responsible for guarding Baochang, and Ruan Xuanwu is responsible for guarding Kangbao, to prevent miscellaneous troops and puppet troops from disturbing the west. Song Zheyuan previously believed that the security of the Zhangjiakou area was very important, so he appointed Feng Zhi'an, commander of the 37th Division, as the garrison commander of Zhangjiakou. There are three reasons for the Japanese provocation this time: (1) After the Japanese clique forcibly occupied Rehe, it publicly declared its intention to划師 (劃歸) Chahar Province into the puppet (Manchukuo) state. Our anti-Japanese troops are now going to northern Chahar to take over defense, and the Japanese side will definitely oppose this. (2) In order to achieve its ambition to annex North China, the Japanese clique is buying traitors everywhere in our territory and recruiting bandit troops. The puppet troops and bandits in eastern Hebei and northern Hebei have already refused our country's suppression. The Japanese army will also maintain and protect the puppet troops of Li Shouxin in eastern Chahar, so that they can be used in the future. (3) The Japanese side is afraid that Song's troops will advance north from Guyuan again and recapture Duolun, so it is using this intimidating method. (16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Refuses to Suppress Bandits in Eastern Luan</h3>
<p>Only Allows Us to Increase Security Forces for Vigilance</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Greatly Increased at Various Passes of the Great Wall</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Yu Forcing People to Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>Dispatch from Beiping: Bandits in eastern Luan are rampant. Our side believes that a small number of security forces cannot eliminate them, and has sent personnel to contact Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, and Nakamura, the commander of the Tianjin garrison, to discuss sending troops to suppress them, but to no avail. Therefore, a few days ago, the Receiving Committee sent personnel to Changchun to meet with Hishikari Takashi, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, to discuss the matter and negotiate the return of various passes of the Great Wall. The personnel sent a telegram to Beiping today (16th), stating that the Kwantung Army, under the pretext of the truce agreement, refused our side to send troops to the war zone to suppress bandits and only allowed increasing security forces to engage in vigilance. After receiving the telegram, the authorities immediately ordered the personnel to continue negotiations and stepped up the training of security forces. If sending troops to suppress bandits is completely hopeless, they will decide to increase the deployment of security forces to carry out suppression and maintain local peace, and relieve the people from distress. The Japanese side is using the bandits in the war zone and does not want our side to eliminate them. At the same time, major passes of the Great Wall are guarded by Japanese troops. Before they are returned, bandits can enter from outside each pass in an endless stream. Even if we want to eliminate them, it is difficult to do so in reality. In recent days, in the Jianchangying area within Lengkou, more than 600 Japanese soldiers have arrived from Yu. Saheqiao inside Xifengkou has also increased by 300 to 400 soldiers and built a large-scale airfield there. The Japanese army's various deployments at the passes are preparing to stay for a long time, and it is feared that negotiations for return are impossible. As for Shanhaiguan, after repeated negotiations to restore the pre-war state, the Japanese side has ignored them. Recently, they have intensified their efforts to force the people of Yu and Guan to elect representatives to go to Changchun to petition for劃歸 (劃歸) Yu and Guan to the puppet state. Each elected representative was given 100 yuan for travel expenses. Yesterday (15th), the Japanese held an anniversary celebration of Japan's recognition of the puppet state in Yu and Guan, and sent police to force shops and households in the city and countryside to hang the puppet state's flag and paste absurd slogans everywhere. Under the oppression, the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out. (September 16)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Instruction on the Significance of Blocking Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Blocking Bandit Areas is an Effective Method of Controlling Bandits</p>
<p>Designates Eight Zones and Dispatches Commissioners for Supervision</p>
<p>Dispatch from Nanchang: Chiang Kai-shek believes that blocking bandit areas and cutting off bandit supplies is an effective method of controlling bandits. The general public inevitably complains about various restrictions on the transportation, hoarding, and purchase of goods, showing a lack of understanding of the purpose of implementing the blockade policy. In order to instruct officials and civilians to temporarily endure small pains for the sake of long-term peace, a proclamation is issued to all provinces for their information. The proclamation says: (In recent years, the Red Bandits, like petty villains, have run rampant north and south of the Yangtze River. Although the National Army has repeatedly suppressed them, it has not yet achieved the effect of annihilating them. The reason for this is that the country has many troubles, and military and political affairs have not been able to focus their efforts, leading to a prairie fire. Furthermore, unscrupulous people in various places have either provided material assistance to the bandits or acted as spies to help the bandits, which is the biggest reason for the bandits' rampant activities. The Committee Chairman is ordered to supervise the suppression and clear them out within a time limit. It is believed that rectifying the military ranks and improving politics are the fundamental goals of suppressing bandits, while intensifying the blockade and cutting off supplies are effective methods of controlling bandits. Therefore, in May of this year, the measures for blocking bandit areas were formulated and promulgated for implementation. However, reports have been received from various parties that the general public inevitably complains about various restrictions on the transportation, hoarding, and purchase of goods, showing a lack of understanding of the purpose of implementing the blockade policy. It must be known that the Red Bandits are more venomous than snakes and scorpions, turning every village they pass into ruins and every county they capture into desolation. If they are still allowed to spread, the small result will be that one place will be ravaged, and the large result will be that the entire nation and country will fall into a terrible state of no return. The facts are all there, and who does not gnash their teeth? At this time when the army is encircling and suppressing them, if we do not fortify our walls and clear the fields, so that the bandits have nothing to plunder when they advance and nothing to eat when they retreat, how can we quickly annihilate the evil and secure our people? As the saying goes, "If a poisonous snake bites the hand, a brave man will cut off his wrist." The people of each place have lived off the land for many years and have long had sympathy for loving their homeland and defending the country. Since they earnestly desire governance, they should all promote the strictness of the blockade, quickly pacify the bandit lair, and ascend to peace together. Isn't that very good? After this earnest exhortation, it is deeply hoped that everyone will understand this intention, endure temporary small pains, and plan for long-term peace. If there are unscrupulous officials, or district and baojia heads, who falsely use the name of blockade and public sale to secretly extort money and deceive property, once the people report the facts, the Committee Chairman will severely punish them according to the law and will never tolerate them. Everyone must abide by this and keep it in mind.)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek designated eight zones for blocking bandit areas and appointed Xia Tongshou as the supervisor of the first zone, covering five counties including Shangrao; Ren Jinzhang as the supervisor of the second zone, covering counties including Dongxiang; Shi Guangying as the supervisor of the third zone, covering five counties including Wannian; He Guanglie as the supervisor of the fourth zone, covering five counties including Linchuan; He Kunxiong as the supervisor of the fifth zone, covering five counties including Fengcheng; Zhu Yiming as the supervisor of the sixth zone, covering five counties including Ji'an; Mei E as the supervisor of the seventh zone, covering five counties including Qingjiang; and Hong Lu as the supervisor of the eighth zone, covering five counties including Xiushui, to supervise the counties and strictly block them. In order to understand the true situation of the blockade in each county and examine the work of the supervisors in each county, Chiang Kai-shek specially dispatched Song Canru, a staff member with the rank of colonel in the General Headquarters, to inspect the eastern zone, and Peng Bingchu, a staff member with the rank of colonel, to inspect the western zone. After receiving the orders, each officer went to each county a few days ago to conduct strict assessments and provide instructions on everything. (September 15, Datong News Agency)</p>
<h3>National Army Suppresses Bandits on Three Routes on the Border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Requests the Designation of a Special Zone</p>
<p>He Chengjun Goes to Lushan to Request Instructions on Post-War Affairs</p>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: Since Liu Zhenhua, as supervisor of troops, advanced to suppress remaining bandits on the border of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, there have been more than twenty battles, large and small. Four to five thousand bandits have been captured and beheaded successively. Many weapons such as rifles, machine guns, knives, and spears have been seized. The only Lie Ning No. 1 aircraft was also captured. However, the bandits' pseudo-25th Army and pseudo-Independent Division, which are known as elite, still have more than 10,000 troops and 4,000 to 5,000 guns, with Tangjiahui as their main lair, attempting to counterattack. When Liu Zhenhua heard the report, he sent troops on three routes on the 13th to suppress them. One route was Song Tiancai's division, one route was Hao Mengling's division, and Liu's own 64th division was also responsible for one route, converging and advancing. On the 14th, Song led the two brigades of Shi Guangqin and Lu Tianfu to advance from Sunjiadian towards Wamiaoji, contacting the main force of the bandits. After four hours of fighting, they finally occupied Wamiaoji and successively recovered the key points of Sidaohe, Gaojiachong, and Chenjiashan. Because the National Army directly attacked Tangjiahui's lair, the bandits were deeply afraid of being attacked from both sides and hurriedly fled back to Tangjiahui, while dividing their troops to defend Dafoshan, to resist Song's division. It is reported that the National Army on all routes has established contact and will launch a general suppression on the 15th, with a deadline to recover. If this force is annihilated, other sporadic bandits can be easily solved.</p>
<p>As for the post-war issues in the border area, the first stage is to take in refugees and provide emergency relief. The provincial governments of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have each allocated 20,000 yuan. Hubei sent Lei Bingkun, and Anhui sent Hou Huaiyuan, to depart with the army and handle relief affairs. Henan requested that the Border Area Headquarters distribute the funds on its behalf. Seven refugee shelters have been established one after another, with Henan setting up shelters in Guangshan, Shangcheng, Jingfu, and Zhoujiafan; Hubei setting up shelters in Huang'an and Macheng; and Anhui setting up a shelter in Lihuang. More than 20,000 refugees have now been taken in. However, Liu Zhenhua believed that the relief funds were too small to be distributed, and proposed a discussion at the Huangchuan meeting, which decided that the total amount of post-war reconstruction funds would be 4.9 million yuan, with 1 million yuan continuing to be used for relief and 3.9 million yuan being used for rural reconstruction. He had previously telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, requesting approval and issuance. After receiving the telegram, Chiang decided to forward it to the central government for allocation together with the post-war reconstruction case in Jiangxi, and first remitted 100,000 yuan for Liu to use. As for activating finance, he considered the urgency and asked Liu to write to the Farmers Banks of the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, asking them to establish branches in Lu'an County, Anhui Province, and to the Hubei Provincial Government, ordering the Provincial Bank to establish a branch in Huang'an, as the hub of economic penetration in the area. In addition, what should be noted is the suggestion to Chiang Kai-shek to designate the border area of the three provinces as a special administrative region. On the 15th, He Chengjun went to Lushan upon Chiang's summons to request instructions on post-war measures. Provincial Committee member Li Shucheng accompanied him, bearing the task of reporting to Chiang and requesting the designation of a special administrative region. Li had attended the Huangchuan meeting on behalf of the Hubei Provincial Government and was elected as the representative to Lushan. (September 16)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Flooding in Ningxia</h3>
<p>Tens of Breaches in Jinji, Zhongwei, and Other Counties</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Villages Washed Away, Nearly a Million Starving People</p>
<p>Ningxia is located in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. In past years, floods harmed the lower reaches, and Gansu and Ningxia were spared. This year's flood season was unusually severe in the three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu. Unexpectedly, after autumn, Ningxia experienced mountain torrents, and the Yellow River was also surging and overflowing. The irrigation canals in Ningxia are higher than the flat ground, so once a breach occurs, it cannot be contained. Currently, there are dozens of breaches in the counties along the river, such as Zhongwei, Jinji, Lingwu, and Dengkou. The villages along the river are covered in water, especially in Jinji and Zhongwei. It is estimated that more than a thousand villages have been washed away, and there are nearly a million starving people. The weather in the northern frontier is colder than in the Central Plains, and the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, with no homes to return to. The situation is extremely tragic. It is reported that the Ningxia Province has sent provincial committee member Hai Tao to request relief from the central government.</p>
<h3>Wujiang Tongren Pawnshop Scheduled to Pay Compensation</h3>

The first branch of the Public Security Bureau's seventh resident post urgently telegraphed the Public Security Bureau's fire brigade and the community fire brigade, which dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire. It was extinguished at 2:10 a.m. It is estimated that six houses were burned down at Caishiqiao Street, including Luxingyuan at No. 18, Zhu Shunxing tofu shop at No. 29, Yufenghang grocery store at No. 31, Hair 苍 at No. 46, Huang Chunjie at No. 47, Jinweiji at No. 49 and 50, and Zhang Tangquan at No. 48, a total of 16 houses, with losses of more than 20,000 yuan. Cao Jinlong, a 14-year-old apprentice at the Luxingyuan restaurant, was burned to death in the fire because he could not escape. His head and face were charred, and his limbs were incomplete. His mother rushed to the scene after hearing the news and mourned over his body, which was an extremely tragic sight. The owner of the shop, Xu Xitang, has been detained by the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Lianhua Employee Commits Suicide in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Deng Jiyuan, an employee of the Shanghai Lianhua Film Company, was laid off after the company's former manager died and Wang Yibo took over. He had been unemployed for a long time and was in dire financial straits. He came to Hangzhou from Shanghai a few days ago to visit friends but was unsuccessful. He was staying at No. 7 Xihu Hotel. Last night, he suddenly had a desire to end his life and bought a bottle of ammonia and drank it. He was barely breathing. Fortunately, the tea boy noticed it and reported it to the local police station, and he was rushed to the Municipal Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Murder Occurs in Shangyu's Dupu</h3>
<p>Shao Baiqing, a resident of the Shantang Village in Dupu, about five li from the Xihaoba Town, is the illegitimate son of the late famous doctor Shao Ji'an. Since Ji'an's death, his brothers have divided the property. Due to the issue of status, he had a dispute with his eldest brother, Zuoqing. Baiqing was addicted to drinking and fighting and colluded with a lawyer surnamed Xia in the city, resulting in endless lawsuits for years. Therefore, his relatives and neighbors hated him to the bone. On the evening of the 8th of this month, Baiqing was drinking at a hotel in Hao and walked home. While drunk, he used an iron rod to smash bowls and plates and left the house resentfully. On the way, he suddenly encountered an assailant who launched a sudden attack. Because of the disparity in numbers and while he was drunk, Baiqing was injured in key parts by a firewood iron hairpin and fell to the ground and died. Subsequently, his half-brother Xiang Ahua and sister reported the injury to the county government on the 10th, and the county government sent personnel to verify it. The corpse's relatives identified the murderer as Shao Mengxiang (ie, Ziqing), the son of Shao Zuoqing, the doctor who committed the crime in the swamp. The accompanying forensic police have taken him to the county for detention.</p>
<h3>Deserters Massacre Four Lives in Jiashan</h3>
<p>On the night of August 31, four infantrymen (from Anhui) deserted from a certain battalion of the Infantry Fourth Regiment of the Provincial Security Office. Wei Jiehua, the battalion adjutant, led a team to chase them. They traveled through Jiaxing Xincheng and inquired all the way before learning that the deserters had shot and killed four members of the Gu Fulong family, who were reed hut fishermen in the Sitingzi area of Shengze Township, on the night of the 2nd. There were deep bullet wounds on each of them. Three quick-firing rifle bullets, one bead clip, and two bead shells were found next to the bodies. Wang, the chief of the Shengze Public Security Bureau, and Xing Han, the patrol captain, together with the county forensic officer, went to the countryside for inspection. The body of Gu Fulong has not been found anywhere. After this case occurred, the public security agencies in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces paid unusual attention.</p>
<h3>Jiashang Cables Request to Abolish Agent Tax for Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiashan County Chamber of Commerce previously believed that it was harsh to tax buyers via agent collection so they especially cabled the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce to request a correction. This order has not yet been approved, and the business tax bureau of the third district has already started the investigation and collection. The various agents are in a panic and have come to the Chamber of Commerce to inquire. It is now known that the County Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance on the 17th, asking for immediate correction and to cancel the original plan. It also pushed the chairman of the committee, Shen Xiping, to discuss with the Business Tax Bureau to postpone the investigation and collection.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Gloomy Wind and Bitter Rain: Solemn Second Anniversary of the (September 18th Incident)</h3>
<p>City Flags Flown at Half-Mast and Entertainment Suspended for Mourning</p>
<p>Various Agencies and Organizations Held Commemorative Meetings</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Delivered a Speech Urging People to Work Hard</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the second anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The gloomy wind and bitter rain doubled the sorrow. Throughout the city, flags were flown at half-mast, and entertainment was suspended for mourning. At eleven o'clock in the morning, citizens across the city stopped working and observed five minutes of silence to commemorate the soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country and the compatriots who were killed. The City Party Headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life at nine o'clock yesterday morning to hold a commemorative meeting. During the City Government's memorial week, Mayor Wu delivered a speech on the efforts that our people should make to commemorate the September 18th Incident. His words were extremely somber and tragic. The authorities of the Chinese and French Concessions took temporary special precautions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives from All Walks of Life Attended the Meeting</h3>
<p>At nine o'clock yesterday morning, the commemorative meeting convened by the City Party Headquarters with representatives from all walks of life was held in the auditorium on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. In the center of the venue, a white cloth banner was hung high, reading "Shanghai Representatives from All Walks of Life Hold the (Second Anniversary Commemorative Meeting of the September 18th Incident)." Slogans were posted around the room. The representatives who attended yesterday included Jiang Huaisu, He Yuanming, and Zhou Lianze from the City Party Headquarters; Qiu Yunming and Chen Jixi from the Land Bureau; Li Zemin from the Public Security Bureau; Sheng Yizhang and Zhang Mengling from the Diplomatic Affairs Office; Li Ping and Huang Chongsheng from the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court; Lu Boping from the National Medical Hall; Jiang Guangqian from the University Alliance; Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association; Zhu Xuefan from the General Labor Union; and representatives from over three hundred organizations and schools such as the Copper and Tin, Sixth District Tea, Fourth District Rubber, Southern Goods, Wood, Military Uniform, Water and Electricity, and Ham trade associations, as well as the Huadong, Huiqiao, Cangji, Songchun, Qinyi, Pengnan, and Huixi schools, and the Party Headquarters of various districts. The meeting ceremony included: (1) Opening the meeting, (2) Singing the Party song, (3) Paying the highest respect to the Party, the national flag, and the portrait of the Prime Minister, (4) Respectfully reading the Prime Minister's will, (5) Observing five minutes of silence to mourn the soldiers who died in the September 18th Incident, (6) Chairman's report, (7) Speeches, (8) Shouting slogans, and (9) Adjournment.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report and Speech Recorded</h3>
<p>After the meeting opened and the rituals were performed, Chairman Jiang Huaisu first reported, saying, "Today is the second anniversary of the national humiliation of September 18th. We must know that the remote cause of the September 18th tragedy was entirely due to the Twenty-One Demands, and the immediate cause was the Northeast's construction of the Huludao military port and other issues, which created Japan's attempt to annex North China. I think everyone already understands this. I feel that in this commemoration, we should realize that the occurrence of the September 18th Incident was purely due to the inability of the entire nation to unify its will, which led to numbness, indifference, and a drunken, dreamlike existence, thinking that China is vast and rich in resources, and that no matter who tramples on it, it will not be completely destroyed. The people across the country did not pay much attention to the Wanbaoshan Incident. Although the people of the three northeastern provinces already felt the pain, they did not express any reaction. As for the boycott movement, everyone thought that it would cause unnecessary losses to industry and commerce. It was not until the January 28th Incident that the citizens of Shanghai felt the personal pain of national crisis, and their patriotic emotions became tense. However, the September 18th Incident, because the people across the country failed to resist in unison, resulted in the sacrifice of the four northeastern provinces. We must have the spirit of sacrifice to save the country, and we must have the tools to save the country to save it from danger. As for the tools to save the country, (1) promote knowledge internally, and (2) strengthen military force externally. In the past, people generally despised soldiers. There was a saying that 'good men don't become soldiers.' Now, this concept has been completely broken. We must implement benevolent rule (that is, realize the Three Principles of the People), support small and weak nations, and not rely on the strong to bully the weak. In the January 28th Shanghai Battle, our country used up one-fourth of its bullets, but the war zone was only thirty Chinese miles, which was enough to make the entire nation change color at the mention of it and break their hearts. However, compared with the European War, it was insignificant. This is purely because the people lack military education. From now on, everyone must take this responsibility. There is no need to cry bitterly. We should use our intelligence and work together to save the country. Starting from today, within three years or five years, we will wash away this shame and let the countries of the world know that we are capable and comfort the dead martyrs. Ten years later, we will hold a grand celebration." Next, Cao Peizi from the University Alliance gave a speech, saying, "Just now, the chairman reported that the problem with the people across the country is numbness and indifference. However, Mr. Wang Yunwu once said that the success of education is also a failure, because those who have received higher education cannot do hard labor, which harms the country and the people. I hope that the so-called intellectual class will engage in production and not only seek to be promoted and make a fortune, in order to save the decline." Zhu Xuefan briefly said, "After September 18th, the three northeastern provinces and Rehe fell one after another. The people did not have a unified will, which made it impossible for the government to respond. From now on, we should cooperate with the government to determine the direction and respond to the national crisis. Only then can we live up to the true meaning of commemorating the national crisis."</p>
<h3>Slogans and Calls to Defend the Country and Resist Insults</h3>
<p>The slogans shouted at the end of the meeting were: (1) September 18th is the greatest day of national humiliation, (2) Continue the spirit of the anti-Japanese martyrs, (3) Save the northeastern disaster victims, (4) Strive to suppress bandits, (5) Develop civil power and strengthen national power, (6) Recover the lost territories in the Northeast, (7) Down with Japanese imperialism, (8) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang, (9) Long live the Republic of China. There were also many slogans on the walls, excerpts from which are as follows: (1) Seek to wipe out the shame and avenge through developing production and strengthening national power, (2) Abandon civil wars, unify will, and work together to appease the country and resist foreign aggression, (3) Suppressing the Red bandits is an essential task for appeasing the country and resisting foreign aggression, (4) Commemorating the national crisis of September 18th, we should strive to develop the Northwest and consolidate the national borders, (5) The September 18th Incident is the greatest day of national humiliation when the Japanese pirates occupied the Northeast, (6) Inherit the spirit of sacrifice of the anti-Japanese martyrs in defending the country and resisting insults.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Speech Was Somber and Tragic</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government held a joint commemoration of the September 18th Incident during the Prime Minister's Memorial Week yesterday morning. Mayor Wu led the heads of various bureaus and all colleagues of the Municipal Government to stand and observe five minutes of silence to express their deep condolences to the soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country in the battles of the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Luandong, and the Great Wall. Mayor Wu also delivered a speech entitled "The Efforts That the People Should Make to Commemorate the September 18th Incident" to inspire the people. The text of Mayor Wu's speech is recorded as follows: "Comrades, today is the Prime Minister's Memorial Week, and it coincides with the commemoration of September 18th. Today, the people of Shanghai should feel particularly sad about commemorating September 18th compared to the people in other places, because during the January 28th Incident, they all experienced it firsthand and deeply felt the pain of the national crisis. They recognized the danger of the national crisis. Therefore, today, when commemorating September 18th, their sorrowful emotions are of course even greater than those of people in other places. However, have the people across the country been commemorating September 18th year after year by holding a commemorative meeting, saying a few sad words, or writing a few articles to publish in the newspaper, and thinking that they have done their best to commemorate it? I remember Mr. Wu Zhihui once said that during the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the people across the country were all shouting and crying for saving the country. Shouting and crying for saving the country is, of course, a sincere and enthusiastic expression of the patriotic emotions of the people across the country, but from the year of Jiawu to now, decades have passed. During these decades, because the people across the country only shouted and cried but did not work hard to engage in the movement to save the country and the actual work of saving the country, the country has not only not been saved today but has instead added several layers of national crisis, and the national situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Also, according to a friend, Mr. Ma Xiangbo once said that he fled the country on the day he was born, and he is still fleeing today. Mr. Ma is now ninety-four years old. The time he was born was just the time of the Opium War. It has been nearly a century since then. It can be seen that the national crisis of our China has had such a long history. This is not because the people across the country do not know how to save the country, but they do not know how to do the work of saving the country from a practical point of view. Therefore, from decades ago until now, they are still only shouting and crying. But we must know that this kind of erroneous national psychology is even more dangerous than knocking on the door and pressing the territory. If we do not correct it in time, our country and nation will inevitably send him his final resting place in the near future. Therefore, today, when commemorating September 18th, we should not just hold a commemorative meeting to talk about a few words or write a few articles to publish and think that it is over. Instead, the people across the country must make a great determination and do it practically. I believe that if we do the work of saving the country in this way, we will definitely have considerable room for improvement. The Prime Minister said that the biggest problem with the Chinese people is relying on heaven for food. Our country has become weak to this point today because of this problem of relying on heaven for food. Of course, the nations of the world have all gone through the theocratic era. In the heyday of theocracy, all countries, like China, entrusted their own destiny to the unknown (number) by seeking gods and divination and completely wiped out all their own abilities. However, the period of time that we Chinese people have relied on heaven for food is particularly long compared to all the countries in the world. Even today, we are still relying on heaven for food. Therefore, like last year's military disasters and man-made disasters in the Yangtze River, the serious national disasters that were intertwined and overwhelmed were all attributed to numbers, thinking that they were not something that human power could resist, and not admitting that they had the ability and knowledge to save the current national crisis.</p>
<h3>National Revival Through Hardship and Struggle</h3>
<p>However, we do not know that the current national crisis is not a (number) entirely caused by our people, and that everything should be attributed to people. All current difficulties and any problems can be saved and resolved from our personnel affairs. Therefore, during this period of national crisis, the people across the country should understand the reasons for causing the national crisis, and at the same time, they must recognize how we can save the country so that the country can be saved, and how we can save the country so that the national crisis can be resolved. If we recognize the great way to save the country, the people across the country must make a great determination and always remember that if we do not work hard, the country will perish, and if we do not work hard, we will have nothing to eat. We must work hard towards this great way. The ancients said, "(National revival through hardship)" and "(A country that has no enemies abroad will always perish)." Now is the most difficult time for China. The people across the country should wake up together and correct all the past erroneous psychologies in order to save the country from its current crisis. We see that in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, whether it is a country or an individual, the success of their careers has always come from the most difficult and arduous circumstances. Our Chinese nation has reached the most difficult and arduous period in its history today, the twenty-second year of the Republic of China. From now on, the people across the country should unite and engage in the main plan for saving the country at present, namely national defense construction and economic construction. National defense construction is used to resist foreign aggression and save the country from danger. Economic construction is used to revive the bankrupt rural areas and relieve the hunger of the people. National defense construction and economic construction must also go hand in hand. If you want to achieve success in national defense construction, you must implement economic construction. If you want to achieve success in economic construction, you must also implement national defense construction. If the people across the country can base themselves on this plan to save the country and work hard from a practical point of view, China will definitely be able to achieve the ultimate success of adversity turning into prosperity in the future. Today, I would like to encourage my compatriots across the country with this idea, and I also encourage myself."</p>

All citizens should take on a responsibility to try to wash away the shame. The most important methods are: 1. Resolutely resist inferior goods, 2. Break off economic relations with them, 3. Under the unified command of the central government, strive to reproduce and teach lessons, so as to strengthen national power. Only in this way can there be hope of washing away the shame.

<p>The Second Hurricane Hit Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>The Wind Was More Violent Than the Last Time</p>
<p>North-South Ocean and Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Were All Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>Tidal Inversion Caused Flooding of Low-Lying Roads</p>
<p>The second hurricane, in two phases, with one currently moving slowly north from the southeast of Taiwan, and the other having reached the sea off the Zhoushan Islands at 9:00 p.m. last night, entering Hangzhou Bay, hit Shanghai last night. The Customs House has notified all ships to postpone their departure to avoid accidents. The weather was dark yesterday, with strong winds and heavy rain, continuing throughout the day, and even worse in the afternoon. In the evening, the tide of the Huangpu River was agitated by the hurricane and flowed backwards, causing flooding of low-lying roads in the concession, with water depths reaching the shins or knees, a very serious situation. As of 3:00 a.m. this morning, the water began to recede. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Passed Hangzhou Bay Yesterday</h3>
<p>The local observatory issued its first report at 11:00 a.m. yesterday, stating that the hurricane was sailing in the East China Sea, having reached 27 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude at 10:00 a.m., moving northwest towards the coast of Zhejiang and tilting further north, possibly passing over Shanghai at night. At the same time, Shanghai would experience a flood at midnight. Later, at 5:00 p.m., a second report was issued, stating that the hurricane had reached the coast between Wenzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang, moving northwest by north, at 28 and a half degrees north latitude and 121 and a half degrees east longitude at 2:00 p.m. (according to which the location is on the coast of Wenzhou Bay). The center of the hurricane was 60 miles away. The wind would tilt further north-northwest and would pass over western Shanghai at night, with strong winds and rain and a lighter sea tide. At 9:30 p.m., the New Sound Society reporter obtained the observatory's final report, learning that the wind had changed direction at 9:00 p.m. last night, reaching 30 miles east of Ningbo, at 30 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, when the Hangzhou Bay and Zhoushan Islands area was only 90 miles away from Shanghai. The wind was very violent and is now turning directly north. From the current situation, it will pass over Shanghai at around 1:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3>A Study of the Hurricane's Course</h3>
<p>The course of this hurricane is quite strange. When it departed from the ocean west-northwest of Guam, an American territory, at 16 degrees north latitude and 136 degrees east longitude on the 11th of this month, it was heading directly for the East China Sea. On the 12th of this month, it suddenly changed direction and circled in a circle between 18 and 21 degrees latitude and 126 and 128 and a half degrees longitude from the 13th to the 15th. On the 16th of this month, it returned to 20 degrees north latitude and 125 and a half degrees east longitude and turned northwest. At 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, it reached the southeast of Wen County, on the ocean at 25 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude. Yesterday morning, it reached a point more than 120 miles east of Wenzhou. At 2:00 p.m., it advanced further to the shore of Wenzhou Bay. However, hurricanes that circle during the journey have only occurred twice last year, and this is the first time this year.</p>
<h3>The Wind Was More Violent Than Before</h3>
<p>According to the Westerners at the observatory, this hurricane was more violent than the last one. When the last hurricane passed through the area north of Huanao Mountain, the wind force in this city was 10. However, Shanghai is only more than 80 miles away from Huanao Mountain. This hurricane reached 27 and a half degrees north latitude, which is 123 degrees east longitude and outside Wenzhou, at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, and already had a wind force of 10. This proves that the wind force was more violent than before. This city had a wind force of 4 yesterday morning, which increased to 6 in the afternoon, and 8 at 9:00 p.m. last night. Huanao Mountain had a wind force of 10.</p>
<h3>The Jianghai Customs Fired a Cannon</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the Customs House received a notice from the observatory that a hurricane was approaching Shanghai and immediately fired a wind warning cannon and hung a large black ball on the roof of the building. A very large black ball was also hung high on the Meteorological Observatory on the Bund of Edward Road to indicate that a hurricane was approaching Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Institute of Research Reports</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report on the 18th stated that the Meteorological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica reported on the 18th that this hurricane was discovered in the ocean northeast of Luzon four or five days ago. It initially moved northwest, passed east of Taiwan on the 17th, and entered the East China Sea at 6:00 a.m. on the 18th. It continued to move northwest and approached the vicinity of Wenzhou at 2:00 p.m., and will likely land at Yong at night. The coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will likely suffer more damage from the storm than the last hurricane.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sea Ships Suspended</h3>
<p>The local Ningbo, Shanghai-Taiwan, Wenzhou, and Ruiping liners were still preparing to depart at 12:00 noon yesterday. Therefore, ships such as the Xinning, Shaoxing, and Xin Beijing still boarded passengers. After receiving the Customs House's warning cannon in the afternoon, it was decided to suspend navigation and refund tickets to all passengers who had boarded the ship, asking them to disembark and leave tomorrow (Wednesday). The Wenzhou and Taiwan ships also stopped sailing. All Shanghai-Zhejiang sea ships were stopped yesterday. At the same time, an urgent telegram was sent to Ningbo, instructing ships such as the Ningxing and Xinjiangtian to also not come. Therefore, no Ningbo ships will arrive today either.</p>
<h3>Exporting Liner Postponement</h3>
<p>This morning, North and South Pacific liners exporting from Shanghai, including the Taikoo's "Suzhou," "Xinjiang," and "Shengjing," Jardine Matheson's "Jiesheng" and "Lisheng," the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Taishun," and the Dalian Steamship Company's "Dalian No. 9," among others, were all prevented from loading cargo due to severe wind and rain yesterday afternoon. At 4:00 PM, a hurricane warning was issued. Therefore, the companies notified the ocean liners to postpone the departure of the aforementioned ships. They will depart after the hurricane passes. Ships en route that are unable to reach Shanghai were also ordered to anchor offshore to avoid the storm and prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Tidal Inversion</h3>
<p>From 8:00 PM last night, fierce winds and torrential rain struck the city, with a force no less than the previous hurricane. The wind strengthened the waves, and the waves amplified the wind's power, creating a scene of ten thousand horses galloping and surging on the Huangpu River. Low-lying areas were flooded. The following is a record of the water situation in various places around midnight last night:</p>
<h3>Songhu Railway Interruption</h3>
<p>Zhanghuabang, located near the coast, along with Paotaiwan, is a town near the mouth of the Wusong River. The embankment there is built with huge stones and is quite sturdy. However, due to years of disrepair, it has eroded considerably. The last time a major typhoon passed through, it almost caused a major disaster. Local authorities are currently working hard to repair it. Unexpectedly, it was hit by wind and waves again last night. There is no report as of the time the reporter is filing this article. However, it is understood that the water level is rising relentlessly. Around 8:00 PM, it was level with the shore. Around 9:00 PM, it surged onto the railway tracks, only a foot or so below the station platform, making the situation very dangerous. Therefore, the Songhu train could not proceed and only went as far as Zhanghuabang Station. Around 12:00 AM, Zhanghuabang Station and the Zhanghuabang Railway Factory were also flooded. Consequently, the Songhu train was blocked again after reaching the Wusong branch station and had to turn back. It is reported that the water level is still rising rapidly, and the situation is very serious. As traffic to Wusong is completely cut off, the true situation is unclear. However, judging from the turbulent waters, the seawall is unlikely to be in good condition.</p>
<h3>Flooded Roads</h3>
<p>In the International Settlement, Nanjing Road (Yinghua Street) and the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Nanjing Road, as well as low-lying roads such as Beijing Road (Guizhou Road), were flooded around 10:00 PM. By 11:00 PM, the water had risen more than a foot. Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Guangdong Road, and the Bund were subsequently flooded, and the flooding gradually expanded. Soon, Henan Road and Shandong Road were also affected. Around 12:00 AM, the water level in front of this newspaper's office had reached more than a foot, and in front of the Central Police Station, it was nearly three feet. Even rickshaws had difficulty passing through, and automobiles were completely disabled, with some breaking down in the middle of the road. By 12:30 AM, all the shops in the Zhoujinli area were flooded. Coupled with the howling wind, the water level continued to rise. There were no pedestrians on the streets, and even rickshaws had disappeared. Occasionally, one or two were waiting for hire on the road, but only for exorbitant prices.</p>
<h3>Suffering of the Poor in Zhabei</h3>
<p>In Zhabei and the Nanshi area, countless shanties of the poor were blown down by the wind. As a result, these poor people were emaciated and sought shelter under the eaves of various lanes or houses. Furthermore, with successive huge waves, they invaded various places, suddenly losing their homes. They ran around to escape, in a very miserable state. Therefore, last night, the entire city of Shanghai was almost entirely in a state of wind and rain, and the situation was very critical.</p>
<h3>Emergency Repair of the Wusong Seawall</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the wind and rain at the mouth of the Wusong River were fierce, and the tide rose sharply. At its highest point, it was only five or six inches from the top of the seawall. Nearby residents were greatly alarmed. However, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works had not yet sent anyone to help. Therefore, Tang Chengzhong, a member of the Wusong Municipal Council, temporarily purchased hundreds of sacks, hired more than eighty workers, and sent them along with staff to the seawall in the Wumufeng area to repair the breaches and prevent any accidents. Committee Member Tang rushed to Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday to urge the Bureau of Public Works. This reporter braved the rain in the afternoon and went to the seawall to investigate the dangerous situation. He saw that the soil inside the stone embankment in the Wumufeng area had also loosened and subsided. Mr. Liu, the supervisor sent by the Municipal Committee Office, told this reporter that this section had been severely damaged and that the project was quite large. At the moment, it is being repeatedly ravaged by wind and rain, so only the breaches can be repaired first, and the major project will be officially repaired by the Bureau of Public Works, and so on. This reporter left Wusong around 4:00 PM and saw several trucks from the Bureau of Public Works coming from Waitan, fully loaded with workers, heading towards Paotaiwan.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Patrols the Embankments</h3>
<p>Jin Qingzhang, Bao Siren, and Wan Kaijia of the Baoshan County Government have strictly ordered the embankment patrolmen to take strict precautions. Zhu Kaichou and Hong Jingping, gentry from Taicang, are also contacting local public organizations.</p>
<h3>Another Hurricane</h3>
<p>According to reports, another hurricane was located in the sea southeast of Taiwan. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it was at 22.5 degrees north latitude and 121.5 degrees east longitude, heading due north. At 2:00 PM, it had moved to 23 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, still heading due north.</p>
<h3>The "Ta Mei Wan Bao" Reports</h3>
<p>Today (the 18th), the strong winds and heavy rains in the city are a precursor to another hurricane strike. This is the twenty-first hurricane of the year. It originated west of Guam on the 11th of this month and initially moved westward. After several hundred miles, it turned northwest, changing its direction in the sea northeast of northern Luzon. It is heading directly towards the Zhejiang coast and is expected to reach the area between Wenzhou and Ningbo this afternoon. After making landfall, it may pass west of Shanghai, sparing the city from a direct hit. However, in any case, the hurricane rains in the city will intensify tonight and tomorrow morning. According to news from Wenzhou, the wind force there is ten units. Furthermore, around 6:00 AM this morning, the wind force at the Daxie Island, outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, had reached six units, and there was a growing trend of intensifying. In addition, there is another hurricane, the twenty-second of the year, originating near Taiwan and heading north, closely following the first hurricane. The wind force is also quite strong, but slightly less than the first hurricane.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspaper Reports National Government Orders Aircraft from the United States</h3>
<p>The "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reports, according to reliable sources, the National Government has signed a contract with an American aircraft company to deliver fifteen new-style Curtiss Hawk II aircraft as soon as possible, with the Hangzhou airfield as the base. Although this news has not been verified by Chinese officials or Mr. Na Maqian, the Far East manager of the company, it was obtained from extremely reliable sources. It is said that the number of aircraft ordered is as many as twenty-five. According to reports, Mr. Na Maqian drove a new Curtiss Hawk II aircraft in Shanghai last Saturday and Sunday to perform amazing aeronautics. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Central Bank, made a special trip by car to Hongqiao Airfield to watch. Mr. Na has also performed many times in Hangzhou, proving that the aircraft is probably the most efficient made in the United States or anywhere else in the world. It can be used for reconnaissance, as well as for bombing with light and heavy bombs, and it can also be specially equipped for attack. The equipment of the new aircraft is unknown. It is said that it will be equipped with wireless telephones and other necessary equipment. It is expected that one that has arrived in Shanghai will be delivered first, and the rest will be shipped by the beginning of next year.</p>
<h3>New Regulations for Export of Merchant Vessels Starting October 1st</h3>
<p>Seafarers Do Not Receive Navigation Bureau Manuals</p>
<p>Customs Implements Ban on Clearance</p>
<p>Navigation Bureau Increases Substantial Revenue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Bureau has been rigorously registering all crew members of ships, and has issued a final notice to the ship companies. If the crew members do not register and pay fees at the bureau to receive manuals, even if they have certificates from the Ministry, it has been agreed with the Customs to ban the ship from clearance and prohibit its export. This matter is of great importance, and the following investigation and report is made:</p>
<h3>Registration Manual</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Bureau stipulates that all deck and engine crew members on ships, even if they have already received certificates from the Ministry of Transportation, must still register at the Navigation Bureau and receive their crew manuals. A fee must be paid when receiving the manual: 4 yuan for shipowners, 3 yuan for chief and second officers, 3 yuan for chief engineer, and 3 yuan for first and second assistant engineers. Seamen pay 1 yuan each. Unemployed seamen must also register and receive a reduction of 2 yuan. Ships are not allowed to employ anyone who does not register and receive this manual. Because there are not many people going to receive them, a stern notice has been issued, with a deadline of the end of this month. Otherwise, the merchant ships will be detained.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Clearance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in order to rigorously implement the registration of navigation manuals, the Navigation Bureau specially requested and was approved by the Ministry of Transportation to inform the Jianghai Customs that the Navigation Bureau had newly created a single form for the export of merchant vessels. From October 1st, ships will not be allowed to depart without this export form. The names, native places, and Ministry certificate numbers of the crew members must be clearly filled in on this export form, along with the registration numbers from the Navigation Bureau manual. The form must be submitted to the Customs for inspection when the ship departs, and clearance will be granted based on this form. If there is no export form, or if the crew members on the form have not received the Navigation Bureau manual, clearance will be strictly prohibited, starting October 1st.</p>
<h3>Shipping Bureaus Urge Action</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the shipping bureaus received notice of this export form. Since the export of ships cannot be delayed, if any crew members have not gone to the Navigation Bureau to pay the fee and obtain the certificate, then the merchant ship will suffer a significant loss when it is banned from clearance at the time. Therefore, yesterday, the shipping bureaus notified the shipowners, chief officers, second officers, chief engineers, and first and second assistant engineers of all merchant ships, ordering them to quickly go to the Navigation Bureau to pay the fee and buy the manual by September 30th, when the ship arrives in Shanghai. Otherwise, in order to protect the ship's operations and avoid being banned from clearance, the shipping company will have to replace the unregistered crew members with crew members who have the manual.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, Imamura, Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" reported that the newly appointed commander of the Third Fleet, Lieutenant General Imamura, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 PM tomorrow aboard his flagship Izumo. Naval officers in Shanghai will visit the ship at 4:00 PM. A ferry will be provided at the Customs wharf to facilitate visits from various representatives. A welcome reception will be held at the Japanese Club at 2:30 PM on the 20th.</p>
<h3>The Swedish Prince is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Hosts Farewell Banquet on the 22nd</p>
<p>After Prince Carl of Sweden returned to Shanghai from his tour of Mount Tai and Qufu, he stayed in Shanghai for a short time for a rest. He plans to visit the city's major factories and the downtown area in the next few days. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 26th aboard the Japanese Empress of the Changxing Company and travel to Hong Kong, then Guangzhou. He is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong on the 2nd of next month to return to his country. Mayor Wu is scheduled to host a farewell banquet at the Municipal Government Reception House on Xiafei Road on the evening of the 22nd. Prince Carl is also scheduled to meet with reporters today to discuss his impressions of his trip to China.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Wenzhou, Forced to Return Home, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Receives Lin Xianting and Eight Others</p>
<p>Temporarily Residing in Hotels, to be Sent Back Home as Soon as Ships Arrive</p>
<p>Eighteen overseas Chinese from Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, were recently forced by the Japanese in Busan and were trapped in a foreign country. It was very difficult. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs remitted funds to send them back home. It is known that Consul Chen Zukan in Busan telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and forwarded it to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating that eight overseas Chinese, including Ruan Jinxing, departed for Shanghai on the Qing'an No. 9 on the 15th of this month and are expected to arrive in port on the morning of the 18th. The Shanghai Municipal Government immediately ordered Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to instruct Yin Guansan, Director of the Relief Section of the Second Division of the Bureau, to rush to the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu, Hongkou, at 9:00 AM yesterday morning to receive the returned overseas Chinese from Wenzhou. According to a reporter from the Guomin News Agency, the names of those who returned to China are as follows: (1) Lin Xianting (41 years old), (2) Yang Zhengren (38 years old), (3) Chen Nanhong (33 years old), (4) Yang Guoqing (31 years old), (5) Zhou Zhongdian (31 years old), (6) Yang Bingxi (20 years old), (7) Xu Baokang (30 years old), (8) Ruan Jinxing (24 years old), and a party of eight people. After arriving at the port, they were taken by car to Xiaodongmen and temporarily resided in Room 47 of the Dongfang Hotel, waiting for the Wenzhou ship to arrive in Shanghai, and will then be sent back to their hometown.</p>

<h3>Robbery Case on Rue Paul Beau: Car Still Not Found</h3>
<p>Victim Shen Yangsheng's Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Suspect Arrested and Interrogated</p>
<p>Zhao Liansheng, also known as Xiao Liansheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 10 Pubo Lane on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, accompanied his wife, Cao, and friend, Shen Yangsheng, to the Jia family in Sande Lane across the street at 8:45 AM the day before yesterday to pay respects. The three walked together to the intersection of Rue Paul Beau and Rue Luban and boarded their private car. As they approached the car, they encountered bandits who attempted to kidnap them. Zhao cleverly drew his self-defense pistol and fired to defend himself, managing to escape. However, his friend, Shen Yangsheng, was forced into the car, and the driver, Zhu Wenyu, was ordered to drive away. The police arrived at the scene, arrested one bandit, Gu Junshan, confiscated a pistol and eleven bullets, and took him to the police station for investigation. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday at noon, the police sent the arrested bandit Gu Jinshan, along with the pistol and bullets, to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District, where Judge Li Changnian interrogated him. Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendant, along with several accomplices, attempted to kidnap Zhao Liansheng on Rue Paul Beau yesterday but failed. The police chased and arrested the defendant, but the victim's friend, surnamed Shen, and the driver and car have been taken away and their whereabouts are still unknown. As the police have not yet investigated the case, he requested that the defendant be detained and the hearing postponed for two weeks for a detailed investigation and the arrest of accomplices. He also presented the pistol and bullets as evidence. The defendant, Gu Junshan, 27 years old, from Funing, said that he used to be a rickshaw puller and had been a soldier, but now he is unemployed and has no residence, borrowing a place to stay with relatives near the Longhua headquarters. He said that the pistol in the case was his, but he had not fired it. The court verified the statement and ordered the hearing to be postponed to October 5th, and the defendant was taken back into custody.</p>
<p>It is further reported that since the incident occurred, the French police have been doing their best to investigate and have also notified the police stations in the Public Concession and the districts of Nanshi and Zhabei under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Public Security Bureau to pay attention to intercepting Zhao's stolen car and Zhao's kidnapped friend, Shen Yangsheng, and the driver, Wei Wenyu. However, as of last night, Zhao's car had not been found. The French police believe that no matter how late, Zhao's car would definitely be found by this morning at the latest. Unexpectedly, as of last night, the car had still not been found, which is unprecedented in the history of robbery cases. In the past, whenever a robbery case occurred in Shanghai, the car stolen by the robbers would be found within a few hours at most. This time, the car has been missing for nearly two days and one night, and there is still no trace of it, so the police are deeply surprised. However, the French police predict that if there is still no new development by today, the robbers will definitely drive the car out of Shanghai, or drive to Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. It is also possible that the robbers are cunning and may have destroyed the evidence, or even sunk the car in the ocean or the Huangpu River, which is also a possibility. As for the robbers temporarily hiding the car to wait for the future, even if the robbers are stupid, they would probably not be so foolish.</p>
<h3>Fee Schedule for Building Plans Set by the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council of Shanghai has stipulated the fee schedule for the map fees for building permits requested by various construction companies, so that the builders can attach the map to the application form for the building permit. The rules are as follows: (A) Land that has already been surveyed: (1) For land under six mu, contained in one land register number, the fee is five taels of silver per map. (2) For land above six mu, contained in one land register number, the fee is ten taels of silver per map. (3) For land with multiple land register numbers, the fee will be doubled according to the previous item. (B) Land that has not been surveyed: (1) Land under two mu, the fee is ten taels of silver per map. (2) Land under two mu, the fee is fifteen taels of silver per map. (3) Land under five mu, the fee is twenty taels of silver per map. (4) For land above five mu, for each additional mu, the fee will increase by two taels of silver per map. The above fee schedule is only applicable to building permit applications. All measurement fees and land register map fees determined by the Board of Directors on December 17, 1931, will still be implemented as before. (C) However, in order to allow builders to store the building map and the building attachments for record purposes, the Bureau may, at the time of applying for the building permit, approve the application of the relevant person and issue additional maps according to the following prices: (1) For land of six mu or less, one tael of silver per attached map. (2) For land above six mu, two taels of silver per map.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Chinese Company Monthly Shooting Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps Chinese Company held the July and August monthly cup shooting competition at the Hongkou shooting range yesterday morning. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and the team members shot in the rain. The competition was for two and three hundred yard Bisley small targets, so the results were inevitably diminished. As a result, Wang Shiting of Class B had the highest score of twenty-three points, winning the July monthly cup. Xie Hong of the same class came in second with twenty-two points, also winning the August championship. The top three shooting scores of each class are listed below for comparison. July Special Class: Chen Shixia 19 points, Xu Shaomei 16 points, Li Yushu 15 points. Class A: Wang Zhexiang 20 points, He Bingcheng 19 points, Zhang Songyuan 17 points.

<h3>New Evidence Discovered in the Renhe Ship Disaster</h3>
<p>Submission from the Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi Five-County Association</p>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Association of Natives of Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Haian, and Qidong Counties to this newspaper states: "Regarding the case of the New Renhe steamer drowning and the theft of Ma Koubao and others, the news published in major newspapers at that time was based on information revealed by those claiming to be family members of the deceased. This association has received a report from Gu Jianan, the main witness in the case, sent by registered mail, along with two photos (showing the reward agreement signed by the family members of the deceased with him). After examining the contents, he deeply regrets being fooled by others and expresses his regret. The facts stated seem to be inconsistent with the news reported in various newspapers. We have also received multiple copies of printed lead type, with the same details as the original report and photos. In addition to keeping the original report on file, we are specially sending the printed report and two copies of the photos with this letter, requesting your newspaper to publish them in the news section so that the public can understand the truth and reveal the facts. We would be grateful for your cooperation."</p>
<p>Gu Jianan's Report: "To Whom It May Concern, in April of this year, the case of the New Renhe steamer murdering hawkers was reported in the newspapers for several days, causing a sensation in society for a time. Everyone believed that the reports in the newspapers were beyond doubt, and the court's conviction of the defendants only confirmed that the punishment was deserved. This matter has become a thing of the past. However, I never knew that human hearts are not what they used to be and that right and wrong are difficult to distinguish. The content is greatly different from what was reported in the newspapers. Jianan is a key witness in this case, and the conviction of the defendants was largely based on Jianan's testimony. In retrospect, I deeply regret my momentary foolishness in being instructed by others. Now, I can only announce the real situation so that the world can understand the truth and reduce my sins. On the evening of April 11th, members of the Yangtze River gang stole silver dollars from passengers. When they were discovered, they knocked out a passenger's front teeth. The next day, passengers were beaten by members of the Yangtze River gang. The sailors on the ship tried to mediate, but were stabbed with knives. This aroused the anger of the passengers, causing an uproar and chaos. It was heard that someone shouted that the perpetrators should be tied up. Jianan was on the ship selling beef for Zhang in the kitchen, so he was on the ship (there were no other hawkers on the ship) and learned of the above-mentioned disturbances. As for whether the perpetrators were tied up, I did not see it. On the 13th, the ship arrived in Shanghai, and Jianan immediately landed. The ship sailed away from Shanghai that day, and I did not go with the ship. On the 15th, Yu Shisheng, nicknamed Little Lion, the leader of the Yangtze River gang (this is the person who was arrested by the Water Police reported in the Shen Bao on September 2nd), came to my house two or three times, saying that there was a murder on the New Renhe ship, and accused me of being an accomplice. I told him that there was a fight on the ship at the time, but I did not hear of any murder, so how could I be an accomplice? He then said, 'What's the use of denying it? If you follow instructions, you will avoid being implicated and can make money.' I immediately refused and he left. The next day, Yu and Yang Chunting from the Water Police came with a pistol. Yang said, 'You didn't follow what Yu said yesterday, so I will arrest you and take you to the team to face charges. If you follow the instructions, we will organize an association of family members (the New Renhe disaster relief association reported in the newspapers), and each family will write a statement agreeing to give you one yuan a day, and in the future, we will take 20% of the compensation fee. We two will sign as guarantors,' and so on. At that time, I was threatened and lured with profit, and I was in a dilemma. If I did not agree, I would be immediately arrested and charged, and I could not predict the outcome. I asked Yang and Yu why they wanted to harm people for no reason. They replied, 'We don't want to put anyone to death for no reason. We're just using this to benefit everyone. Besides, when the money is in hand, we can settle the matter and not harm anyone. Why wouldn't you want to do it?' I asked how much the compensation fee would be. They said, 'You don't have to worry about this. We will find people to organize it. The more family members there are, the more compensation there will be.' Jianan believed them to be true at the time and agreed to do so. On the 18th, Yang brought Zhou Mengshi and others, saying that they had organized five family members, and each person could get at least 10,000 yuan in compensation, totaling 50,000 yuan. You have the hope of getting 10,000 yuan.' Yang Chunting took out a piece of paper from his sleeve, wrote a statement, and told me to keep it safe. He then ordered me to go to the Water Patrol Team to report the case and asked me to clearly recognize the faces of Zhou Mengshi and the other five people. In the evening, the Water Patrol Team set off to the New Renhe ship to Shanghai and arrested the people on board. When the entire staff was arrested and interrogated, Yang ordered me to listen to the interrogation and identify each person to ensure that I would not make a mistake when testifying in court. When I saw the crew members being tied up one by one and forced to confess, I felt like I was dreaming. There was no sign of the so-called money settlement, and many people were harmed. This was not what I originally expected. When my father found out about it, he severely reprimanded me. I reflected on it in the quiet of the night and regretted it too late. But the matter has come to this point, and there is nothing I can do. Now, I am stating the facts as they are. In addition to having already filed a statement with the court, I am attaching two photos of the statement made by Zhou Mengshi and others. I sincerely request your association to publish the above information in the newspapers so that the public can understand the truth and perhaps reduce my sins in the slightest. I hope for your public review. Respectfully submitted to the President of the Tong, Ru, Chong, Hai, and Qi Five-County Association, Gu Jianan (fingerprint), father writing on behalf of."</p>
<p>Statement by Zhou Mengshi and others: "Because our husbands and others were brutally murdered, please ask the authorities to redress the injustice. We request that Gu Jianan, an eyewitness, provide evidence. Fearing that it will hinder daily business, we are willing to pay back one yuan per day for the loss. If we receive compensation in the future, we are willing to offer 20% of the total amount as a reward. Fearing that words are not enough to rely on, we are making this statement as evidence. Late evening of April 18, 22nd year of the Republic of China.

<h3>Inauguration of Four Major Distribution Centers Including the Home Industry Cooperative Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech (崇實 Save the Nation)</p>
<p>The four major distribution centers of the Home Industry Cooperative, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, China Yapoer Electric Appliance Factory, and China Pottery Company were inaugurated yesterday afternoon amidst the sound waves of the radio broadcasting emcee. Despite the violent wind and rain on that day, the venue for each factory's distribution center was still extremely crowded. The entrance of the Home Industry Cooperative was particularly packed with people. Mr. Wang Xiaoying, a member of the Legislative Yuan, held the opening ceremony. After visiting the four distribution centers, Mayor Wu, together with Director Pan Gongzhan, Commissioners Wang Yansong and Wang Xiaolai, were invited by Qin Runqing, Wang Boyuan, Chen Xiaodie, Hu Xizhi, Hu Zu'an, Cheng Nianpeng to attend the "September 18th National Humiliation Commemorative Speech" at Fuxing Broadcasting. Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, roughly stating that two years have passed since September 18th, but as the old saying goes, "A gentleman takes three years to avenge a wrong." As long as everyone works together to save the nation through industry, the revenge will surely be achieved in less than three years. Mayor Wu delivered a speech on "崇實 Saving the Nation." Mr. Wang Yansong gave a particularly clear speech on the history of the four factories. The final program was the poignant and moving drama "Blood and Tears of Eternal Spring" by Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, which stirred the audience. Mayor Wu's speech is as follows, entitled "崇實 Saving the Nation": Gentlemen, today, at the invitation of the Home Industry Cooperative, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, China Yapoer Electric Appliance Factory, and China Pottery Company, I am here to give a national humiliation commemorative speech. I feel deeply grieved. The Home Industry Cooperative, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, China Yapoer Electric Appliance Factory, and China Pottery Company are usually down-to-earth, working hard in industry. They have made many practical contributions to the nation and society. This spirit of seeking truth from facts and saving the nation with 崇實 is truly worthy of admiration from the people of the whole country. Therefore,</p>
<h3>Strange News of a Poor Man Selling Himself</h3>
<p>A Husband Can Be Obtained for £60</p>
<p>New Jersey, Camden, USA. It is common for women to sell themselves to find husbands due to poverty, but it has never been heard of for men to sell themselves to find wives due to poverty. A local newspaper here recently carried an advertisement that reads: "Unemployed man Mr. Haines, 25 years old, widowed, with a son of just three years old, who is very lovable. Now, due to maternal hardship, if any decent and honest person can offer £60 to help him, he is willing to devote himself to them and guarantees to be a good partner." (Reuters) Brothers, I will take the meaning of 崇實 Saving the Nation as the topic of today's speech. I hope that all the people of the country will commemorate this serious national crisis with the spirit of 崇實 and save our precarious national destiny. Regarding the meaning of 崇實, since the national crisis, whether I am giving a speech anywhere or writing articles for any newspaper, I have almost always directly or indirectly paid attention to this point. I remember that when I gave a radio broadcast speech this spring, I said something like this: The greatest danger in China now lies in the fact that the general public still does not know the true meaning of the national crisis, nor the reasons for the national crisis. Those who lead the public to save the nation only engage in superficial excitement and do not make practical efforts. Therefore, although there has been a national salvation movement after every national crisis in the past century, every national salvation movement has ultimately failed to save China. Our enlightened people should learn from the pain, and from now on, thoroughly understand the meaning of the national crisis, reflect on the causes of the national crisis, be down-to-earth, and make a firm and courageous determination to fight and save the nation. We must encourage ourselves with perseverance and make practical efforts in terms of culture, education, the duties of our respective professions, and our usual lifestyles, so as to enrich the content of national life and consolidate the foundation for national development. Every bit of effort we make is a bit of salvation for the country, and the sum of the efforts of the people of the whole country is the final success of the nation's efforts to wipe out its humiliation and become strong. Our Chinese nation was originally one of the first nations in the world to create culture. The reason why the Chinese nation was able to create culture first was because our ancestors worked hard and devoted themselves to improving their lives or the environment. Unfortunately, this spirit of creating culture, 崇實, and striving gradually disappeared after the Han Dynasty. By the time of the Jin, Wei, and Six Dynasties, the fatuous emperors, treacherous ministers, aristocratic rich, defeated generals, remnants of soldiers, palace women, official prostitutes, and men of letters abandoned the inherent spirit of creating culture of our nation, indulged in debauchery, and were obsessed with money and pleasure. They were completely unable to recognize their responsibilities to the country and society, and even had no purpose in their personal lives. For thousands of years, the spirit of education has been to cultivate emotions, and the only desire of the intellectual class is to prepare for laziness. The so-called "ten years of hard study" is nothing more than a plan for lifelong comfort. Although education has been reformed in recent years, a boatload of Confucian scholars still dream of Western-style houses, cars, beautiful clothes, and abundant food, all kinds of tools and equipment for laziness and comfort. As for the practical problems of the general public's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, how they should be improved and how they should be solved, they are completely ignored and completely irresponsible, and their own needs in life must be relied upon by others. Because of the laziness, vanity, and parasitism of the scholar-officials, Chinese society has caused national education to be unrelated to the people's lives and the survival of the nation, and has no benefit whatsoever. The whole country, from top to bottom, is moving towards this dead end of selfishness, greed, laziness, and indulgence. No one is willing to fulfill their practical responsibility of labor and production for the nation and the country. There are few who produce and many who consume, so how can the people's livelihood not be tight, the country not be poor, and the nation not be weak? Therefore, the only urgent task for us to save the country today is to restore the inherent spirit of creating culture of our nation, be down-to-earth, and work hard to increase national production and improve the lives of the people. If a nation cannot be independent culturally or economically and must rely on foreigners in everything, it is the greatest danger and the greatest shame for a nation. Therefore, since ancient times, the principle of national rejuvenation has always been to focus on 生聚 and 教訓. In ancient times when science and culture were immature, it still required ten years of 生聚 and ten years of 教訓 in order to seek rejuvenation. Today, when science and culture are advancing by leaps and bounds, if we do not fundamentally restore the ability of our nation to create culture, and do not work hard and encourage ourselves with perseverance and practical efforts to enrich the content of national survival and consolidate the foundation for national development, but only talk about resisting the enemy and empty talk about saving the nation, then it only shows the immaturity and vanity of the national psychology, and the effort to save the nation and become strong will never have the slightest practical effect.

<h3>Soviet Russian Aid Association Manager Accused</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Sues for Illegal Infringement of Freedom and Other Crimes</p>
<p>The Second Trial Was Held Yesterday, and the Defendants Were Released on Bail</p>
<p>Mikev, a Russian manager of the Soviet Russian Aid Association at No. 2 Beijing Road, previously filed a case in the First Special District Court against a Russian named Morrison for embezzlement. Judge Qian has already ruled that Morrison is not guilty. Now, Morrison has also hired lawyer Qiu Fenling to sue Mikev, the manager of the Soviet Union Aid Association, Russian deputy manager Bobiqu, bookkeeper Kraslafsky, staff Yazimengaou, female secretary Maoxifa, and Russian woman Biegaofa, and six other people, at the First Special District Court, for illegally arresting, detaining, robbing property, and fabricating false accusations. The reasons for the prosecution are roughly as follows: The plaintiff, Morrison, used to be an employee of the first defendant, Mikev's company, for many years and has never made any mistakes. In May of this year, Mikev, because the plaintiff was unwilling to help him with political work, wanted to send Mao back to Soviet Russia for punishment. Mao, fearing misfortune, had no choice but to avoid Hankou. Mikev, angered out of shame, falsely accused him of embezzlement and filed a criminal lawsuit. At the same time, the fourth, fifth, sixth, and third defendants were sent to break into Morrison's residence at No. 374 Jiangxi Road with weapons, imprisoning Mao's wife in the bathroom, ransacking boxes and cabinets, and robbing him of 11,177 US dollars in cash, 722 British pounds, a bank passbook, and a check. Defendants two and three issued receipts. Afterwards, Mao returned to Shanghai to respond to the lawsuit and was declared not guilty. Although Mao only asked Mikev to return the lost items, he admitted that he had handed over the bank passbook and check to the Far East Bank, but completely denied the huge amount of cash. Since Mikev has already admitted that the passbook and other items were handed over to the Far East Bank, it is undeniable that they were robbed from the plaintiff. It is found that Mikev first fabricated false accusations and illegally infringed on the freedom of others, and then robbed others of their property. He has committed crimes under Articles 180, 316, and 341 of the Criminal Law. The actions of the other defendants in jointly carrying out the crime have also constituted a crime and should be investigated and punished according to the law, and ordered to pay compensation, etc. The court, according to the complaint, summoned the defendants on September 7th and ordered the case to be retried at 11:00 a.m. on the 18th. If a certain defendant did not appear, lawyer Wei would be responsible, and the deposit of 5,000 yuan would be confiscated according to law. The defendant must also be taken into custody for interrogation. Yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., the date for the trial of this case had arrived. Judge Xue Lanru presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Because this case was of great importance, many Russian men and women and reporters from various Western newspapers came to court to listen. All six defendants also appeared in court and hired lawyers Chen Yingzhang, Shi Zhao, Zou Lianfeng, Li Zuyu, and Wei to defend them. Judge Xue first interrogated the plaintiff, Morrison, and after he made his statement, he interrogated each defendant one by one until 2:00 p.m., when the interrogation was still not completed. The official then ordered the case to be retried next Thursday, and the defendants were still released on bail after paying the original bail.</p>

<h3>Closing Arguments in the Suspected Murder of Wife Case</h3>
<p>丨Sentencing Scheduled for the 25th丨</p>
<p>A case of suspected murder of a wife occurred in the Bu family's house in Caijia Lane, Yangjing, Pudong, causing a sensation in the surrounding area. The husband's aunt, Jiang Gu Shi, and the husband, Jiang A'gen, have been prosecuted by the local court. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., Judge Yang Qianchang continued the trial. The defendant hired lawyer Xue Jiesheng to defend him. The official asked Jiang Gu Shi, who stated that she was 41 years old, a native of Shanghai, and lived at No. 26 Duanjia Lane, Yangjing, Pudong. Jiang A'gen is my son. I gave birth to him when I was 19 years old. My husband's name is Jiang Sihai, and he is dead. Jiang Zhu Shi is my daughter-in-law. Q: When did you marry her? A: On the second day of the tenth month of the year before last. Q: Are you and your daughter-in-law usually on good terms? A: Yes. Q: Do you live with your son and daughter-in-law? A: Yes, we lived together. Later, we moved out on October 24th. Q: Did you move to a new house? A: Yes, my daughter-in-law and son moved to the old house. Q: Did your daughter-in-law and son quarrel on April 9th this year? A: No. Q: How did your daughter-in-law die? A: She went out to pick vegetables and I don't know how she died in the river. Q: There are injuries on her head, which were found to have been caused by a hoe. Where did they come from? A: I don't know. Q: Blood stains and a bloody vegetable were found in the vegetable garden of your new house. The test results show that it is the same as your daughter-in-law's blood. A: This was because her mother's family destroyed my house. The children were watching the fun and broke the glass, and the blood dripped on the ground. Q: There are stab wounds on the top of your daughter-in-law's head. A: When my son went to see the body, there were no injuries. Q: After your son fought with your daughter-in-law, maybe she committed suicide. A: There have never been any quarrels. Q: The prosecutor's indictment states that your son injured her and she died in the river. A: It's a false accusation. At this point, the official asked Jiang A'gen, who stated that he was 23 years old, a native of Shanghai. Jiang Gu Shi is my mother, and Jiang Zhu Shi is my wife, whom I married in October of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Q: Are your wife and mother on good terms? A: We have always been on good terms. Q: Why did you separate? A: Because she didn't wash the clothes cleanly, I slightly admonished her and she asked to separate. Q: Did you fight with your wife on April 9th? A: We never quarrel. Q: There are injuries on her head and waist. A: When I went to see the body, there were no injuries at all. Later, I went to call my mother out, and they beat me. I don't know how the injuries happened afterwards. He then cried loudly. The official asked the plaintiff, Zhu Zhao Shi, who stated that she was 58 years old, a native of Shanghai, and lived in Yangjing. The deceased, Jiang Zhu Shi, is my daughter, and Jiang A'gen is my son-in-law. My daughter is 24 years old this year and married at the age of 22. They often fight and cry when they come back. We always send her back and say good things to them. This time, she was brutally murdered by them, which is the truth, but I did not witness it. Her son, Zhu Guisheng, stated that he was 36 years old, the deceased was his younger sister, and his words were the same as his mother's. The official said that it is possible for husband and wife to fight and injure each other, but it is unlikely that she would be thrown into the river. Perhaps she committed suicide out of anger. He then asked the witness, Zhu Minghai, who stated that he was 27 years old, lived in the same house as Zhu Guisheng, and did not know about everything about this case because he was working in Puxi. At this point, Prosecutor Li presented his opinion, and then lawyer Xue Jiesheng stood up to defend, saying that the crime in this case is called murder, which is very broad in criminal law. There must be all kinds of acts of murder, and there must be concrete acts of murder. The court must protect human rights and seek justice for the victims, which is the duty of national law. However, the defendants are the victim's mother-in-law, husband and wife, and close relatives. Now, only relying on the statements of Zhu Zhao Shi and others is just empty talk. The examination has raised doubts. At the same time, the atmosphere in the market villages is not open. After this incident, rumors spread, causing a sensation in the city, and it was assumed that someone had committed the crime of murder. However, the act and the result of the law must have material evidence, oral evidence, and circumstantial evidence, which are completely lacking now, and it is inevitable that the facts are fabricated. Seeing that the plaintiff destroyed the house, he knew that he could not determine that his daughter was murdered. As for the blood on the vegetables, it is said to be the same. However, Shanghai doctors must choose the same blood type when transfusing blood, so the blood type cannot constitute evidence of a crime. Moreover, a man in the countryside spends thousands of gold to marry a woman, would he be willing to put her to death for no reason, not fearing that it would hinder the ancestral rites? Therefore, this case, based on the analysis of no evidence, should be found not guilty. At this point, the official announced the end of the arguments and announced that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 25th. The defendant was sent back to custody.</p>
<h3>Foreign Soldier Forcibly Drove a Car Causing an Accident</h3>
<p>Beating a Chauffeur and Killing Xu Shui Jin</p>
<p>Fled Without a Trace Afterwards, Police Investigating Strictly</p>
<p>Yesterday's Autopsy, the Foreign Soldier Still Not Apprehended</p>
<p>A foreign national wearing a military uniform of a certain country suddenly came to the Hua'an Automobile Company at No. 27 Tiantong Road on the morning before yesterday and rented a car with the number 17838, saying that he wanted to go to Zhao Feng Park. At that time, the fare was agreed upon as $1.50, and the chauffeur Li Mao Di was driving. Unexpectedly, when the car drove to the west of Hart Road, the foreign national forcibly seized the chauffeur's position and drove the car himself. Li refused, and was beaten by the foreign national with fists and feet. He was eventually overpowered. When the car had barely reached Yu Yuan Road, near Di Feng Road, it carelessly knocked down a local resident, Xu Shui Jin, 27 years old, and the rickshaw he was riding, with both man and vehicle falling to the ground. Xu was severely injured by the car running over him. Seeing that he had caused an accident, the foreign national quickly jumped out of the car and fled westward. Li was extremely shocked at this sight, and immediately gave chase behind the car, but it was too late and the foreign national escaped. Afterwards, a Chinese constable No. 1569 happened to see this and immediately notified the Jing'an Temple Police Station by telephone, ordering detective Qian Xianzhang to go to investigate. He then sent the injured person to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly thereafter. The body was taken to the autopsy station on Bian Lun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei to the station to examine the body. The case was opened and Li Mao Di testified that the foreign national came to rent a car that day, and his accent was like English. He was wearing a military uniform. The company assigned me as the driver, but unexpectedly, when we got to Hart Road, he wanted to drive himself. Because my duties were at stake, I firmly refused. He then used violent means to beat me, causing injuries to my head. I was weak and unable to resist, and he was eventually overpowered and drove away. Not long after driving, this accident happened. Chinese constable No. 1569 also testified that at the time the car knocked down the person, he didn't witness it. He only saw a foreign soldier running madly westward, and the chauffeur was chasing after him. He also saw the deceased being crushed by the car and falling to the ground, unconscious. I then reported it to the police station. After obtaining the statements, Mr. Guo ordered that Xu Shui Jin, the deceased, was indeed crushed and killed by car number 17838 before his death. The foreign national who caused the accident is being strictly investigated by the police station according to the law. The body was handed over to his wife, Xu Wu Shi, after she made a statement, to be returned for burial.</p>
<h3>Change of Address for Bidding on Food for the French Defense Forces</h3>

<h3>Liu Ruiheng and Others Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>To Attend the Standing Committee Meeting of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, in order to investigate the actual situation in the disaster area, sent the committee's Director of the Health Group Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Emergency Relief Group Xi Dejiong, Director of the Work Relief Group Zhou Xiangxian and others to fly to the disaster area to inspect the situation by special plane. They have already completed their work and returned to Shanghai and will report the inspection situation to Chairman Song. Because the disaster victims are crying out for relief, the committee has decided to convene a standing committee meeting in Beijing today to discuss relief matters. Directors Liu, Xi, and Zhou have already left for Beijing by night train last night. The Central News Agency reporter visited Director Zhou at the committee yesterday morning and asked about the work relief methods. According to him, this Yellow River breach has a total of more than 30 breaches in Changyuan, Kaocheng, and Heze, totaling more than 100 li in length, so the affected area is wider than in the past. Emergency relief is of course imminent, but the repair of the breaches and the reinforcement of the embankments are also important. The work relief fund has already been decided to be 1.5 million yuan. This small amount of money can only be used for temporary rescue. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission should handle the consolidation of the embankments. The Work Relief Group of the committee has already sent work relief experts from Hankou this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to Kaifeng, Jinan, and other places to jointly plan and carry out work relief with the Henan and Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureaus. It will soon be hiring workers to build. It is also learned that in order to facilitate the implementation of relief, the committee will first set up disaster investigation offices in Jinan and Kaifeng to investigate the severity of the disaster in each area and then provide relief. As for the establishment of branches of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee in Jinan and Kaifeng, they will also be established one by one in the near future.</p>
<h3>Ten Benevolence Associations Meeting on Relief Work in Western Shandong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Jiesheng Association invited the nine benevolence associations in Shanghai to hold a meeting at the association. More than 20 people including Huang Hanzhi, Xu Qianlin, Zhang Lanping, Weng Yinchu, Huang Jing'an, and Zheng Zhongshan attended. Xu Qianlin was elected as chairman. Director Li Changwei reported on the emergency relief situation and said that in the face of the current great catastrophe, we should do our best to appeal for the miserable disaster victims who have no clothes or food. It was decided to raise several million yuan for relief funds. The Jiesheng Association was elected to handle the disaster in western Shandong. The association deliberated and decided to appoint Li Junyunmen as the director, and the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Emergency Relief of the Yellow River Flood will add 30,000 yuan to the association for joint operation. Director Li decided to depart from Shanghai on September 21 with relief workers and medicines to provide relief to Heze County in western Shandong, selecting the most needy for distribution. However, according to the representative's report, there are more than 300,000 disaster victims in the county. Tens of thousands of dollars is a drop in the bucket and will not help. It was also heard that a certain great philanthropist donated 30,000 yuan alone and asked the Red Cross Society to handle a county in western Shandong alone, which is very gratifying. In these times of widespread sorrow, with the autumn wind about to pass and the north wind about to come, how can there be thousands of great philanthropists, donating huge sums of money alone, each handling a county, to save these dying disaster victims, so that they can have hope of being revived? This is what our heartfelt incense, with nine kowtows, prays for.</p>
<h3>National Government Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Establishes Audit Committee</h3>
<p>Inviting Pan Xulun as Chairman, Qin Fenwen Also Likely to Be a Member</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee of the National Government, believes that the expenditure of the committee's relief funds is very large, and there must be an audit organization for the accounting and reimbursement aspects. Therefore, a special audit committee was established to take charge of this matter. Pan Xulun, a practicing accountant at the Lixin Certified Public Accountants Office, Qin Fenwen, Director of the Accounting Bureau of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and Wen Yiyou, Director of the Second Department of the Audit Department, were invited to be members of the audit committee, and Pan Xulun was designated as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<h3>Chuansha Flood - Method Agreed Upon by Donation Team Leaders</h3>
<p>The situation of the flood in Chuansha County has been reported previously. It is now learned that the county's Relief Committee recently hosted a banquet for the donation team leaders at the Daguanlou Restaurant to discuss fundraising methods. It was tentatively decided to raise 45,000 yuan, divided into 30 teams, with each team raising at least 1,500 yuan, and as much more as possible. Apart from the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association committing to five teams, and the donations from the Chinese Jisheng Society and the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee forming four teams, the remaining team leaders include Huang Renzhi (月 team), Zhang Bochou (盈 team), Lu Bohong (昃 team), Gu Bowei (晨 team), Zhao Zengtao (宿 team), Tao Qing (列 team), Ding Jiaying (張 team), Ding Gengyao (寒 team), Shen Defu and Chen Sanlin (來 team, combined), Ling Yunzhou (暑 team), Huang Zhaolu (往 team), Zhang Zhuxi and Xue Meiquan (秋 team, combined), Song Shuxiao and his brothers (收 team), Lu Wenmei (冬 team), Zhen Jiuyu (藏 team), Chen Yanzhou (閨 team), Zhang Yixin (餘 team), Cai Boliang (成 team), Lian Wenbin, Ling Xiufeng, and Xi Baisheng (歳 team, combined), Li Leng, Yang Wenyong, Ji Tifan, Wu Shangzhen, and Lu Rongan (吕 team, combined), and Lu Zhongchao, Zhang Gengyu, Tang Shang'an, Zhang Liaohong, Fu Jieqing, Zhu Shanyuan, and Xu Minbo (律 team, combined). Each team was allocated four donation books and was responsible for signing for and collecting them. The Shanghai Pudong Bank was entrusted to collect the donations, starting from September 11th and ending on October 10th, with the aim of raising the full amount within one month.</p>
<h3>Road Administration Inspection Team's Report on the Inspection of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Points out areas for improvement in train operation and stations.</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau ordered relevant departments to implement accordingly.</p>
<p>The Road Administration Inspection Team of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, led by Director Huang Boqiao, inspected the model stations along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway for the first time on the 6th of this month and has already returned to Shanghai. The inspection process and opinions have been reported, and after research by the Railway Bureau, instructions have been issued to the relevant departments to implement them separately. The report is as follows:</p>
<h3>Train Operation</h3>
<p>The trains were generally in good condition, but the following points should still be noted: (1) If passengers take up multiple seats with their luggage or obstruct other passengers' seats, the passenger transport inspectors and ticket collectors should inform them politely. If necessary, they can arrange for someone to help place the luggage on the luggage rack. (2) All old glass mirrors, old regulations, and other dirty door fittings on the train should be removed. (3) Absolutely prohibit fare evasion. (4) If any unusual or abnormal conditions are found during train operation, the train personnel should immediately notify the driver to pay attention. (5) The practice of using a side track for train exchange at the Benniu Station is inappropriate and should be investigated and reported.</p>
<h3>Major Stations</h3>
<p>(1) Suzhou Station: (a) The space is small, crowded, and disorderly, and the food sold is also unhygienic and should be strictly prohibited. (b) The interior and exterior of the station and the kitchen of the dining hall are unclean and should be rectified within a time limit. (c) The wiring throughout the station is messy and should be rectified immediately. (d) Rickshaw pullers outside the station shout and push when trains arrive and passengers exit the station, obstructing passengers. The local public security bureau should be consulted to find a way to quickly ban this. (2) Wuxi Station: (a) The information desk should be improved immediately. It should not be located inside the platform but in the station hall. (b) Notice boards should be placed in appropriate locations so that passengers can easily read them. (c) The noise from vehicles outside the station is the same as in Suzhou. (3) Changzhou Station: (a) The interior and exterior of the station are unusually messy, and the walls of the waiting room and station building are particularly unclean. (b) The information desk is the same as in Wuxi and should be improved immediately. (4) Zhenjiang Station: The overall order of the station is well-maintained and relatively clean and should be commended.</p>
<h3>Welcoming the Anti-Japanese Heroes' Association Delegation to Suzhou to Present a Banner to Su Bingwen</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Organizations' Welcoming Committee for Anti-Japanese Hero General Ma Su's Return to China previously selected Ye Jiaxing, Sun Mingqi, Wang Honghui, Chen Binghui, Wang Hesong, and others as representatives to present a banner. Sun Mingqi and others departed for Suzhou yesterday and agreed with General Su Bingwen to hold the banner presentation ceremony at 12:00 noon on the 19th at the auditorium of the Suzhou Garden Hotel. After Ye Jiaxing received a telegram from Sun in Suzhou, he took the night train to Suzhou last night to represent the presentation of the banner. The Shanghai community will present General Su with a satin banner and a gold medal. Representatives from various organizations such as the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce and the County Party Headquarters will participate in the ceremony, which will be very grand.</p>
<h3>Housing for Troops of Wang and Li - Postal Savings Bureau Approves a 10% Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Reply has been sent to charitable organizations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees previously housed over 130 family members of the anti-Japanese generals Wang Delin and Li Du's troops. The Association leased four buildings, numbers 16, 17, 18, and 25, in the Laishou Lane on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession from the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Business Department, at a total monthly rent of 426 yuan. The Association requested the Bureau to reduce the monthly rent to save expenses, as raising funds was difficult and the refugees could not be sent back for the time being. It is now learned that the Association has received a reply, temporarily approving a 10% rent reduction.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Requesting Restoration of the Old System of Taxing Pawnshops</h3>
<p>Businesses are slow and unable to bear heavy taxes.</p>
<p>Hope that the Municipal Council does not kill the goose that lays the golden egg in order to maintain tax revenue.</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that the pawnbroking industry is heavily taxed and unable to bear the burden, requesting the restoration of the old tax rate. The letter stated: "Regarding the case of the pawnbroking industry requesting the restoration of the old system of taxing 2/1000 of the pawned amount, we sent a letter to your bureau on July 15th along with a survey form, but have not yet received a reply. Now, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Association, stating that members in the Public Concession are suffering from declining business and request the Municipal Council to continue taxing 2/1000 of the pawned amount in accordance with the original regulations to maintain their businesses. The Association had previously compared the actual business volume of each firm over the past three years with the current tax payments and prepared a survey form to be forwarded to the Municipal Council as proof. It is now reported that all members within the Concession have stated that business has become increasingly slow and they are unable to pay the huge taxes. Therefore, they unanimously request that starting from this winter, the Municipal Council should offset the overpaid tax of 9,348 yuan from the previous three years and the overpaid tax of 1,442 yuan from this summer. If this is not done, they fear they will be unable to maintain their businesses and will follow in the footsteps of Yuan Tianchang Hongsheng and other pawnshops by suspending operations. They also reported the pawned amount and tax paid for this summer, requesting that we prepare a form and send it to the Municipal Council for verification. After investigation, the above statements are true and accurate. Therefore, we are sending the newly prepared survey form in duplicate to your bureau for review and request that you also forward the plea of our members to the Municipal Council for approval. We hope that you will consider restoring the good system as soon as possible to avoid killing the goose that lays the golden egg and to maintain tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Public Association Continues to Request Suspension of Land Survey and Mapping Fees</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Public Association continues to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting the immediate suspension of land survey and mapping fees. To Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: In our previous telegram, we requested changes to the land survey methods and a reduction in expenses. We received a reply stating that the request had been forwarded to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance for consideration. We are grateful for your consideration. Large-scale surveys are costly. The survey in Hangzhou County has been ongoing for four or five years, costing over 2 million yuan, and has not yet been completed. Based on this, the land survey expenses for the entire province of 75 counties, large and small, will be over 50 or 60 million yuan. In this time of poverty and economic collapse, where will such a large amount of funds come from? Even with forced extortion, collecting a fee of 5 jiao per mu will likely fall far short of this amount, and it will be difficult to avoid abandonment halfway. After our telegram was published in newspapers, people from all walks of life sent letters suggesting triangulation or plane table surveying. They all agreed that the cost was too high and the people could not afford it. We plan to collect opinions from people throughout the province in the shortest possible time, concentrate on a suitable method, and submit it to your office for consideration by the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance. Before the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance submit their reply, we request that you order Haining, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Pinghu, Wuxing, Changxing, Qianshan, and Yuyao counties to immediately suspend the collection of survey and mapping fees to avoid waste and to relieve the burden on the people. Land consolidation is a necessary procedure for realizing land policy, and the people are eager for its implementation. However, we fear that it will be suspended due to financial constraints, repeating the mistakes of Hangzhou County and Shangshan Dongxiang. The people will bear the cost of the land survey but will not receive the benefits. This is not your original intention to govern with diligence. This matter concerns the interests of the entire province, and we dare not hesitate to appeal again and again.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Workers' Strike in the Yinxiang District - Strike Started Yesterday Morning and Resumed in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cleaning workers in the Yinxiang District demanded improved treatment and made conditions, which were rejected by the cleaning company. All workers went on strike yesterday morning, stopping the emptying of garbage buckets, which caused inconvenience to residents. Fortunately, after the mediation of Party and government organs, a resolution was reached, and work resumed completely at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Cleaning Industry Union of the Seventh District, at the request of its members, presented conditions for improved treatment to the cleaning company contracted in the Yinxiang District. Because the cleaning company had no sincerity in accepting, the mediation of the Fourth District Party Headquarters was ineffective. The union members, at a general meeting, resolved to organize a strike committee and scheduled the strike for the 17th. The strike was temporarily postponed after the advice of Party and government organs. However, the cleaning company insisted on not accepting the conditions. Therefore, all workers went on strike at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, stopping pushing carts and emptying garbage buckets. Residents in the Hongkou area felt quite inconvenienced. After the Fifth Precinct of the Public Security Bureau received the report, it immediately dispatched police to prevent incidents. All the striking workers lived at home. Fortunately, no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Advice</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, considering that the cleaning workers' strike concerned public health, sent Lu Yinchu and Zhu Jintao to advise and mediate. They summoned Tang Jingshou of the cleaning company, Wang Asan of the Cleaning Industry Union of the Seventh District, Shen Ding of the Fourth District Party Headquarters, and Zhang Peishen, a gentleman from the Yinxiang District, to conduct mediation. Around 2:00 p.m., the cleaning company and the Shanghai Cleaning Workers' Union agreed to a resolution. All workers accepted the union's order to resume work at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Resolution</h3>
<p>The resolution reached through mediation is as follows: (1) Wages will be increased by 25% across the board, starting from September 21st. (2) The cents in wages should be paid in silver dollars. (3) The cleaning company will subsidize each worker with 1 jiao and 5 fen silver dollars per day during rainy hours. (4) The cleaning company will issue 2 silver dollars per year to each worker for the purchase of cleaning equipment. (5) The cleaning company will subsidize the union's operational expenses with 40 silver dollars per month. (6) When hiring new workers in the future, union members should be given priority. (7) These conditions are valid until June of the 23rd year of the Republic.</p>
<h3>Feng Laosi Released Yesterday</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Declares No Further Detention</p>
<p>Feng Laosi, a native of Shandong, was previously detained by Inspector Jiang Feng of the Huizi Police Station on suspicion of selling opium and handed over to the First Special District Local Court, requesting permission for continued detention. The court ordered Feng to provide a guarantor and leave the courtroom to await further questioning. Subsequently, the police station found that Feng was not involved, so Judge Wu ordered the cancellation of Feng's guarantee. Later, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters discovered that Feng Laosi was suspected of committing murder in the interior and sent personnel to request his transfer. Feng was therefore detained, pending the Garrison Headquarters presenting sufficient evidence for verification. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing of this case. Judge Xue Lanru ascended to the bench in the Eighth Criminal Court. The Garrison Headquarters also sent an official letter stating that Feng Laosi was not involved in the murder and declared no intention to transfer him. Lawyer Feng Yanfan argued in court that since Feng was not involved in the murder case, he should be released immediately. Judge Xue then ordered Feng Laosi's release.</p>
<h3>New Ruiping Steamer Robbed</h3>
<p>Robbers disguised as Coolies boarded as Passengers</p>
<p>Searching and Robbing Money and Clothes</p>
<p>Since the Yu Gu steamer robbery, there is still a group of pirates hiding in the Shanghai area, plotting to rob merchant ships. Various shipping companies in Shanghai were notified in advance and have been taking strict precautions. Passengers without guarantees are not allowed to board. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. The pirates, seeing the shipping companies taking such strict precautions, were unable to strike. Unexpectedly, they sneaked into Wenzhou inland and robbed merchant ships along the Zhejiang coast, making the shipping companies unable to defend themselves. The New Ruiping, a regular ship on the Ruian-Pingyang route in Wenzhou, belongs to the Shanghai Huxing Company. It operates between Shanghai and Ruiping and has excellent business. There are four ships operating on the same route. The New Ruiping left Ruian on Monday, stopping at various small ports along the way to Shanghai. On Tuesday morning, the ship arrived at Chumen and stopped to load cargo and passengers as usual. Unexpectedly, nine pirates, each carrying a handgun, disguised as coolies and boarded the ship. There were no inspecting soldiers or police in the area, so the pirates were able to board the ship safely. Not long after the New Ruiping set sail, at around 8:40 a.m., the pirates on board split into groups and started robbing. It was said that when the pirates started robbing, they first pretended to fight. Then, two of the pirates, armed with guns, coerced and monitored the captain, driver, and accountant. The remaining pirates searched the passengers' cabins, first robbing money, then clothes, and then miscellaneous items. Even silver coins and copper coins were robbed. For twelve hours, the New Ruiping was controlled by the pirates and had to listen to their commands. It was not until 9:00 p.m., when the ship arrived near Haimen, that the pirates released a sampan into the sea and forced two fishing boats nearby to transport the stolen goods ashore before escaping. The total loss is estimated to be nearly 10,000 yuan. Some passengers who resisted the pirates were shot and injured, but their lives are not in danger. When the pirates were robbing, several barges at the Chumen pier heard gunshots and then cries coming from the New Ruiping. The boatmen on the barges reported this to the branch office, but because the ship had no radio and no marine police, there was no way to help. After the pirates had finished looting and escaped, the ship returned to Shanghai. The Huxing Company gave each of the affected passengers a relief fund of 15 yuan. The company has now reported the incident to the military and police authorities in Ruiping, requesting them to quickly arrest the pirates. They are also discussing anti-theft and safe navigation measures with other shipping companies on the same route.</p>
<h3>Monks Not Following Religious Rules</h3>
<p>Men and Women Gathering to Gamble - Arrested and Sent for Interrogation</p>
<p>Gu Junyan, the Chinese head constable of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Chinese detective Hua Shuxun, broke up a gambling den at No. 258 Wuzhou Road in Hongkou at around 7:00 a.m. yesterday. They arrested the hostess, Li Chen, Wang Zhang, along with twelve gamblers playing pai gow who were monks with the dharma names Yingyue, Zengyuan, Xinke, Jihang, Nengzheng, Ruicheng, Xin'an, Ruixiang, Rongshi, etc., and seized gambling equipment, mahjong tiles, and dozens of silver dollars. After interrogation, the head constable scolded them for being monks and daring to gamble in mixed company of men and women, violating religious rules, and ordered them to be detained and sent to court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Melon Seed King Lawsuit Rescheduled for Retrial</h3>
<p>The Haichilai Company, the originator of the Melon Seed King, sued the Fulushou Company for illegally using the company's registered trademark. The First Special District Court has held several hearings. The court sent the paper bag designs of both parties to the Trademark Bureau for identification. The Trademark Bureau replied that the Fulushou Melon Seed Factory had previously applied for registration and had been rejected according to law. At 2:00 p.m. on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court reopened the case. The result was that the two defendants, Rong Xingcheng and Du Chuqing, were each ordered to pay a 1,000 yuan store guarantee, and the retrial was rescheduled for the afternoon of the 21st. The two defendants were also ordered to present the Trademark Bureau's rejection letter to the court at the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Da Hu Bank to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Da Hu Bank, organized by Sun Honggao, Wang Yansong, Yu Guozhen, Ma Shaoquan, and others in the local financial community, has built its own bank building at Huajin Lane on Sanma Road.

It is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>

(4) Regarding commemorating former General Secretary Wu, it was resolved that the Executive Committee would send commemorative items to express their continued gratitude. The meeting adjourned at 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Sun Yushun, who has stated that he read a news item in your newspaper's news column about Sun Yushun's son being kidnapped.

<h3>His Talent Is Not As Good As You, Your Life Is Not As Good As Him</h3>
<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>Zhu Yuanzhang, while at the Huangjue Temple, suddenly had worldly desires and was unwilling to continue accompanying the green lamp and ancient Buddha. He took up his spear and broadsword, and fought his way out of Haozhou. When he established his capital in Nanjing, he was overjoyed and said to his subordinates, "Unexpectedly, what started as a game has become reality!" One can imagine his elated state. Because he was too eager to govern, he often gave excessive rewards and punishments, which led to the following story circulating among the people.</p>
<p>It is said that once, after drinking a bit too much wine, he woke up from a nap and wanted some tea. Coincidentally, a eunuch who was neither fully male nor fully female, brought him a bowl of strong tea. He was extremely pleased and bestowed countless rewards. A poor scholar learned of this and wrote two lines of poetry: "Ten years under a cold window, how does it compare to a cup of tea?" As he repeatedly recited the poem, Zhu Taizu happened to be passing by incognito. He knew it was a satire of him, so he continued the verse from outside: "His talent is not as good as you, your life is not as good as him!"</p>
<p>Wonderful! The philosophies of serving as an official and becoming wealthy, and the emperor's strategies for employing and administering people for thousands of years in China were revealed by these two lines of poetry. In reality, being an official does not necessarily require great talent, as long as one has good fortune, even without talent it is possible; having talent does not guarantee a high position, if one has a hard life, even great talent is useless. Officialdom and fate are interdependent, but have nothing to do with talent.</p>
<p>However, although Zhu Taizu valued fate over talent, he still employed grand masters to examine the scholar's eight-legged essay, rather than employing fortune tellers to arrange the scholar's birth chart. This can be considered as distinguishing true talent and dispelling superstition. In reality, it was still deception. This is called entrusting fate to talent, because those with good fate can succeed in all three imperial examinations even without talent, while those with bad fate will still have a miserable life. Acceptance or rejection still depends on fate and not on talent. Someone asked me, "Does China still value fate or talent more now?" I cannot answer. But among the gentlemen not in office, if they consider themselves to have great talent, then it is valuing fate; if they consider themselves useless, then it is valuing talent.</p>
<p>There is a way to remedy everything in the world. If talent is lacking, then put in ten years of effort under a cold window; if that is not enough, twenty years of effort; if that is still not enough, thirty years of effort will eventually do the trick. Only fate, once destined, cannot be changed. This humble one has spent days and nights racking my brains to come up with a half-baked solution that everyone might as well try.</p>
<p>This method is to ask men and women from all walks of life to first find a lucky day and time before starting to work at the grassroots level. This will align with the auspicious couplet: "Erecting pillars on an auspicious day; the beam raising meets the Purple Star." The offspring will surely be wealthy and noble. This can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Locks and Keys</h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>I recently installed a door lock, which inevitably led me to think about keys.</p>
<p>The Chinese do not pay much attention to locks. Is it because the Chinese have the virtues of not closing their doors at night and not picking up lost items on the road, or is it because bandits are rampant and locks are useless? Therefore, they casually put a lock on the door that can be opened with a piece of lead wire, and casually install a lock on the silver cabinet that can be opened with a lighter flint.</p>
<p>However, foreigners are different. They pay special attention to locks. Even if it is the same brand of lock, each one has its own unique structure. Therefore, each lock has a different key. Not to mention that a key from one brand cannot open a lock from another brand. Even a key for number 100 of a lock cannot open number 101 of the same lock.</p>
<p>Because of the relationship between locks and keys, I thought of the division in Chinese and Western academia.</p>
<p>Chinese people, after mastering the Four Books and Five Classics, and writing successful examination essays, can do anything after being placed on the gold list. Legislation, judiciary, administration, everything can be done. Moreover, after serving as a governor, they can then manage river works. If barbarians happen to revolt, they can immediately be appointed as commander-in-chief to suppress them. After serving as an imperial censor, they can be transferred to the Ministry of Revenue. If they are in the mood, they can even serve as a governor-general or train an army. This symbolizes that the keys to Chinese locks can open any lock.</p>
<p>If foreigners study a certain field, they cannot change careers for life. Their doctors cannot practice medicine if they do not come from medical school, unlike us who have scholar-physicians. They must have a law degree to practice law, unlike us who have Shaoxing legal secretaries. This symbolizes that locks have their own keys. Moreover, even if they are from the same engineering field, those who study electrical engineering will work in electrical engineering for life, and those who study railways will work in railways for life. This is the reason why a key for number 100 cannot open a lock for number 101.</p>
<p>In recent years, China has sent many students to study abroad, hoping to transform the old Chinese locks and keys into Western-style ones. However, to their surprise, those who studied literature, law, or agriculture can become police chiefs, water conservancy bureau chiefs, or county magistrates upon their return. There are many such examples. I have no name for these talents and can only call them Chinese-style Western locks.</p>
<h3>The Art of Begging</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhuyu</p>
<p>At the foot of the Xin Zha Bridge, a Russian was speaking to a Chinese beggar as if giving a lecture: "When you beg for money, you always hunch over with your head down and your back bent, without any spirited performance. Look at how we Russians beg for coins. We always stick our bellies out high and act respectfully and politely, first performing a full salute, and then opening our mouths to speak. Although our transaction is small, it should have some artistry. Otherwise, wouldn't the donor's money be wasted? Friends, remember! Times have evolved, and everything must have artistry. Begging is no exception, otherwise, you will fall behind!" Alas! In this day and age, begging really requires artistry.</p>
<h3>Four Battalion Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Guests Depart with Bashful Affection and Gentle Smiles, Visitors Arrive with Old Hatreds and Letters of Sorrow</p>
<p>Now hearing the direction of Mother Liu's words was entirely in favor of the Gan family, the more she spoke, the more angry she became, and she blushed as she said, "Mother Liu, you think people giving you things is a great favor, but in fact, it's just that rich people don't want to throw things into the filthy dirt, and are just using poor people's stomachs to store them. I say, we poor people must fight for this bit of dignity, rather die of hunger than eat other people's leftovers." Jiang Clan glared at her, looking at her and saying, "Our old girl, that's just her temperament, quick-mouthed and quick-tongued, no matter if these words can be said or not, she has to say them. For example, people are kind enough to give you something to eat, whether you want it or not, you have to temporarily accept it on the surface. You can't possibly let Mother Gan give you something and you throw it on the ground." Mother Liu was originally a little embarrassed by Gui Zhi's bold and unreserved words. Now that Jiang Clan rushed to explain it to her, this was considered to have room for maneuver. So she laughed and said, "It's still our old sister-in-law who speaks the truth. You think we poor people can afford not to look at the faces of rich people at all, how can that be possible?" Jiang Clan said, "To speak frankly, their old man might have a little bit of official airs. As for their Mrs. Gan, she's the same as us, just people in the bedroom, relying on people to prosper, following people to suffer, what else is there to say?" Saying it like this gave Mother Liu even more room to maneuver, and she thought that since Ji Zhi often came here, his mother and daughter might have a good relationship with Gan Ji Zhi, so she said, "That Second Master Gan is very good." Jiang Clan knew that her daughter was most deeply stimulated by Ji Zhi, and these words would take her life, so she absolutely dared not bring up those relationship-related words, and just snorted. However, Mother Liu was completely unaware of these reasons, and she became excited and continued to say these words. (191)</p>
<h3>Imitating Others</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I saw this lesson in a textbook: "There was a merchant selling hats, carrying a load of hats of all sizes, and stopped at the foot of a mountain to rest. At the foot of the mountain there was a big tree, but there were many monkeys on that big tree. Seeing the merchant selling hats wearing a hat on his head, they felt it was novel, so they came down from the tree together and robbed the load of hats, putting them all on their heads and escaping up the tree. Later, the merchant selling hats, in desperation, quickly took off the hat he was wearing on his head and threw it on the ground, so the monkeys on the tree, seeing it, also threw down the hats they had robbed and were wearing on their heads!" This is "imitating others."</p>
<p>Originally, monkeys are most fond of imitating others, which is not surprising. What is strange is that those knowledgeable "people" often imitate others in many ways. Now, for example: Westerners and Westerners, when they meet each other, of course, love to speak English, jibber-jabber. However, there are many people who are clearly Chinese and Chinese, and when they meet and talk, instead of speaking the very good "Mandarin," they must speak that jibber-jabbering "foreign language!" This is also "imitating others."</p>
<p>Then there is "dancing," "kissing," "eating Western food," "using foreign goods," and there is no end to these things. In short, whether it is customs, human feelings, clothing, eating and drinking, and all kinds of enjoyment; everything that is stained with Western colors is considered "Europeanization" by the fashionable people, but if you take off the Western lens, what is not "imitating others"? The so-called "Europeanization" is just a nice word.</p>
<p>Although we know that Japan's Meiji Restoration also looked at Europe and the United States as examples, and learned from Europe and the United States as models, and now only a few decades have passed, it has suddenly jumped into the ranks of the world's great powers. Looking at it this way, "imitating others" is not necessarily undesirable. However, it depends on what kind of example you are looking at and what kind of model you are learning. If you look at other people's bad examples and learn other people's superficialities, then what is the difference from the monkeys' "imitating others"?</p>
<h3>Short Message</h3>

<h3>About Bees</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>One spring, I unfortunately suffered from a very dangerous illness. After the illness, the doctor repeatedly told me that I must recuperate in another place to prevent a relapse. So, for fear of death, I hid myself in a small town near Kunshan. The town's residents, including the public security bureau's police station and several small temples, numbered less than fifty families. After 7 p.m. or on rainy days, you could not hear a single human voice. Life was certainly very difficult. Fortunately, next door to the house I lived in, a Mr. Su was raising several boxes of bees, as if it were a recreation arranged especially for me in advance. Every morning, I would rush over to watch, and I would continue to watch after eating, and I would not go back until it was dark and there were no bees to watch. After watching like this for dozens of days, I began to understand the greatness of bees.</p>
<p>In short, bees are really the most diligent and orderly animals. In their group, except for the larvae, no one can survive without working. They all have a queen, and everyone loyally and carefully supports it. Every year, before setting out to collect honey, all the worker bees line up in rows outside the hive, facing the hive, waiting for the queen's inspection. After the inspection, those who should collect honey go to collect honey, those who should return to the hive to protect the larvae return to the hive, and those who should take on the guard duty outside the hive stay outside without leaving for a moment, and none of them will wander around. What is even more strange is that every bee must greet the guard bee when entering and exiting the hole, and it seems that there is a fixed time. Once the fixed time has passed, no one is allowed to enter or exit. Once, in order to show me the strict discipline of the bees, Mr. Su specially caught a bee, put him in a small box, and after a night, put a dot on him with a vermilion pen, and then released him back. An hour later, when we went to the front of each hive to look, we found that the bee with the vermilion dot was lying dead on the ground in front of a certain hive, of course, because he did not return overnight, so he was stung to death by the guard bee. Our experiment was successful, but unfortunately, this bee was killed by us.</p>
<p>Whenever a new queen is born, the old queen (i.e., the mother of the new queen) must take all the new worker bees away from the hive the next day, and let the old worker bees serve the new queen. The night before, the hive must be restless all night, buzzing as if they were saying goodbye. Therefore, when beekeepers encounter this situation, they must prepare a new hive the next morning to allow the old queen to settle down, otherwise this group of bees will never return. Two different groups of bees will inevitably start a fierce battle when they meet. But after the end of the war, the victorious bees will automatically take on the burial work. They use their feet to hook some dead bees from the ground, all the way to the cracks in the tiles paved on the surface, and carefully hide them; one by one, they will not let go until all the bee corpses are hidden.</p>
<p>Most insects respect the female, and bees are of course the same. The queen bee and the worker bees are all female, but the worker bees have a stinger on their tail, so they cannot mate. After the queen bee is born, she only mates once, and once she has mated, she can never mate again, but she can give birth endlessly. The mating situation is also very special. First, a virgin queen bee flies back and forth alone in the air, and soon many drones swarm over to pursue her. The word "pursue" is really the most appropriate. Because as soon as the queen bee sees the drones coming, she immediately runs away, and the drones naturally chase after her desperately. Whoever catches her first, the victory belongs to whoever. But extreme joy leads to sorrow. When the mating is over, his reproductive organs get stuck in the queen bee's tail and can no longer be pulled out. As a result, the queen bee takes his reproductive organs away, and this bee becomes a romantic ghost who dies under a peony flower. However, after this mating, the queen bee can never mate again.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province's Education Budget for the 22nd Year: Regular and Temporary Expenses Increased Compared to the Previous Year</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province's education expenditure budget for the 21st year, including the three special funds of field tax, slaughter tax, and broker tax, totaled 3.8 million yuan. Combined with 200,000 yuan from administrative income and 300,000 yuan in subsidies from the provincial treasury, the total was 4.3 million yuan. In the 22nd year, the field tax will be increased by 80,000 yuan to 2.52 million yuan, the slaughter tax will be increased by 50,000 yuan to 650,000 yuan, and the broker tax will be increased by 20,000 yuan to 630,000 yuan, totaling 3.95 million yuan (an increase of 150,000 yuan from field tax, slaughter tax, and broker tax). Combined with 200,000 yuan from administrative income and 300,000 yuan in subsidies from the provincial treasury, the total budget for this year is set at:</p>
<p>Revenue side: 4.45 million yuan.</p>
<p>Expenditure side: (Regular expenses) amounted to 3,558,340 yuan, categorized as follows: (1) Higher education expenses: 279,902 yuan (including expenses for specialized normal schools, fisheries schools, the National Studies Library, subsidies for the Science Society of China, and study abroad expenses); (2) General education expenses: 2,543,536 yuan (divided into four items: 1. Secondary schools: 2,096,407 yuan; 2. Primary schools and compulsory education expenses: 383,520 yuan; 3. Subsidies for Nanching Middle School and other middle schools, normal schools, vocational schools for boys and girls, and kindergartens: 35,992 yuan; 4. Special projects for primary and secondary schools, such as study tours, participation in sports meets, scouting inspections, and travel expenses for other meetings convened by the department, tuition fees for children of revolutionary martyrs, and other special projects: 27,617 yuan); (3) Social education expenses: 624,212 yuan (divided into: 1. Social education institutions: 577,400 yuan; 2. Social education projects: 22,200 yuan; 3. Subsidy expenses: 24,612 yuan); (4) Other institutions and administrative projects: 110,784 yuan. (Temporary expenses) amounted to 891,566 yuan (including 453,000 yuan for offsetting accumulated deficits and reserve funds for actual temporary items), categorized as follows: ) General education temporary expenses: 393,000 yuan; (2) Social education temporary expenses: 60,000 yuan; (3) Offsetting accumulated deficits from previous years: 140,000 yuan; (4) Reserve funds: 298,566 yuan (the reserve fund listed in the previous year was 298,248 yuan).</p>
<p>Comparison of two years: Last year's field tax, slaughter tax, broker tax, administrative income, and provincial subsidies totaled 4.3 million yuan. This year, the three items of field tax, slaughter tax, and broker tax increased by 150,000 yuan, with total revenue of 4.45 million yuan. On the expenditure side, except for the repayment of old debts, which was listed at over 400,000 yuan last year and 140,000 yuan this year, which is less, the regular expenses for each item have increased due to the expansion of projects in the 22nd year. For example, the implementation of the integration of training and education in primary and secondary schools requires an increase of 100,000 yuan to revise the budget standards, 60,000 yuan for the additional grades of primary and secondary schools, 20,000 yuan for establishing rural normal schools, increasing promotion fees for provincial primary schools, preparing experimental areas for compulsory education, adding experimental areas for mass education, transforming the pottery engineering department of Yixing Vocational School into a junior ceramic vocational school, the Jingjiang Mass Education Center, recovering the Yu Tang Mass Education Center, and various social education special projects and administrative projects. The total increase in regular expenses compared to the previous year is estimated to be over 380,000 yuan. The temporary expense budget, in addition to the originally listed repair and equipment fees for primary and secondary schools, the expansion equipment fees for vocational schools and vocational departments of middle schools, and the temporary expenses for social education, which still need to be listed in the 22nd year (the originally listed establishment fees for specialized normal schools and the establishment fees for Suzhou Industrial School will no longer be listed, except for a portion that will still be listed for Suzhou Industrial School), the added expenses include the equipment fees for the weaving machines in the dyeing and weaving factory of Suzhou Industrial School, the purchase of fishing vessels for the fisheries school, and the repayment of the loan for the silk reeling equipment of the Women's Sericulture School. The increase in temporary expenses compared to the previous year is estimated to be about 88,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Provincial Department Relief: After the Education Department of Jiangsu Province decided on the above budget at the Jiangsu Education Expenditure Committee meeting, it immediately notified the Education Expenditure Management Office. Considering the accumulated deficits over the years and the practice of spending future income, it feared that income would not cover expenses. Therefore, it proposed 350,000 yuan from the temporary expense portion and 50,000 yuan from the regular expense portion to be designated for offsetting accumulated deficits, noting that the allocation should be temporarily suspended to leave room for flexibility. This matter will be submitted by the Education Department to the next Education Expenditure Committee meeting for discussion and decision, and to seek a comprehensive plan for other revenue sources and relief. Before the submission for discussion, the Education Department has the authority to allocate the province's education budget, so there is not much of a problem.</p>
<p>School Difficulties: This year's temporary expenses are only 453,000 yuan, of which 350,000 yuan has been temporarily proposed, leaving 103,000 yuan. Each school and social education institution has projects that urgently need to be carried out and equipment that needs to be repaired. It is heard that the principals of provincial schools held a meeting on the 15th and discussed ways to increase funding and will make suggestions. If a complete solution is to be found, a temporary meeting of the Education Expenditure Committee must be convened, as the committee is required to meet every few months according to regulations, which would be too slow to address the urgent need.</p>

<p>Shanghai City Games Ball Games</p>
<p>Women's Volleyball Finals: Wuben Defeats Haixing</p>
<p>But the championship is still a pending case, awaiting review and resolution by the organizing committee. Men's Volleyball: Although Xiaguang Defeated Dongya, It is Still Considered a Forfeit.</p>
<p>31 Participants in Men's Singles Tennis, Starting Tomorrow. Numbers for Track and Field and National Arts to be Issued Starting This Afternoon.</p>
<p>The ball game competition of the 3rd Shanghai City Games was held yesterday, the third day. Affected by the strong winds and rain, the outdoor competitions, such as soccer, tennis, and softball, were all suspended. The volleyball competition was moved to the indoor venue of the China Basketball Hall. In both competitions, the issue of player eligibility arose. The Xiaguang team used unregistered players such as Xu Heng and Gu Shangxiang to compete. As a result, although they defeated Dongya, it was still considered a forfeit, and Dongya regained the qualification for the semi-finals. In the women's volleyball final between Haixing and Wuben, it was claimed that Guo Xiaoping of the Haixing team was a physical education teacher from a certain school, which violated the amateur regulations. The Minli team filed a protest. This matter has not yet been resolved and needs to be reviewed by the review committee at a meeting. Before the issue is resolved, the matter will be explained to both Haixing and Wuben teams, and the competition will proceed as usual. If it is confirmed that Guo Xiaoping's qualifications do violate the amateur rules, then the match between Haixing and Minli should be considered a forfeit by Haixing, and Minli and Wuben will compete in the final. The result of yesterday's match was that Wuben won 3-1 and won the city championship. If Guo's qualification is not a problem, the championship will still belong to Wuben; otherwise, the championship cannot be resolved and must be determined by the final between Minli and Wuben.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the semi-finals of the men's volleyball will be held, and there will be matches in soccer and women's tennis singles and doubles. However, if the weather does not cooperate, it may be difficult to hold them on time. The women's softball final will be held in the China Basketball Hall. In addition, there are as many as 31 participants in the men's tennis singles, which is an unprecedented event in Chinese tennis. The schedule has been announced and will start tomorrow (20th). The numbers for track and field and national arts athletes will be issued starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Athletes are requested to collect them from the Education Bureau. Details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Dongya Benefits from Misfortune</h3>
<p>Xu Heng of Jinan is a Famous General</p>
<p>His Skills on the Net are a Sight to Behold</p>
<p>In the men's group, Xiaguang played against Dongya first. In the first set, Xiaguang used all Daxia players, who were heavily pressured by Dongya and lost 8-21. The entire team's formation was scattered and unable to respond. Iron-armed hero Wei Dingyi had no partner to use his skills. Starting from the second set, several players from Jinan, such as Xu Heng, Gu Shangxiang, and Hong [blank], were brought in, and the team's formation was renewed. Xu Heng's work on the net, feinting to the east and attacking to the west, and his smashes were like lightning, unpredictable. At the same time, Wei Dingyi, with Xu Heng's assistance, unleashed his high-pressure skills. Dongya turned pale with fear and suffered pressure, losing three sets in a row. Xiaguang reversed the defeat and won. However, because Xu Heng and others were not registered, Xiaguang was immediately ruled to forfeit, and Dongya benefited from misfortune and won the victory. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Xiaguang</p>
<p>8-21 21-15 21-7 21-7</p>
<p>Dongya</p>
<p>Although Dongya has no special strengths, the team's talents are average and the coordination is good. The Xiaguang team is disorganized and appears to rely entirely on talent without training. In the first set, Dongya had smooth sailing and won 21-8. In the second set, Xiaguang switched sides with an 11-8 lead. At 13-11, Xu Heng and others from Jinan were brought in, and the team's military appearance suddenly became strong. Wei Dingyi, who had been frustrated, got Xu Heng's help and was like a fish in water, able to display his skills. His smashes were like cannonballs, and each one achieved miraculous results. From then on, it was smooth sailing, and they won 21-15. In the third and fourth sets, Xiaguang became more and more successful, and Dongya's vigor was frustrated and declined, failing 7-21 in a row. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Xiaguang</p>
<p>Huang Jianfei Gu Shangxiang Xu Heng Huang Jinfa Chen Baohua</p>
<p>Wei Dingyi Mei Hong Zhong Guoneng Wang Deyuan</p>

<p>Wuben Defeats Haixing</p>
<p>Guan Liuzhu of Haixing Shows Her Skills, Wuben is Known for its Familiar Coordination</p>
<p>Haiben and Haixing are about the same strength. The performances of the two teams were not very brilliant. Miss Guan Liuzhu of Haixing worked hard and her smashes were excellent. Guan made a great contribution to Haixing's score and was the most outstanding talent in both teams. Wang Chunruo's technique is flexible, skilled, and delicate. Miss Guan was able to do what she wanted, thanks to Wang. The two worked together seamlessly and were well-received by the audience. However, the whole team could not respond to each other and was often flustered, resulting in a miserable defeat. Wuben is known for its average talent and skilled coordination, without any special outstanding features. The results of the match are as follows:</p>
<p>Wuben</p>
<p>22-20 15-21 21-17 21-17</p>
<p>Haixing</p>
<h3>The First Set is Tense</h3>
<p>Guan Yanjiao of Haixing serves first and scores one point. Wuben scores four points in a row. Haixing catches up and ties the score. Wuben takes the lead again, and Haixing ties again. Wuben wins 11-8 after switching sides. After that, Wuben repeatedly took the lead, and Haixing followed closely behind, with gains and losses for each other. It was difficult to tell who was better. Finally, it became 20-20. Wuben won 22-20.</p>
<h3>Haixing Wins the Second Set</h3>
<p>Chen Yingrui of Haixing serves at the beginning of the second set. They took turns taking the lead. After 7-7, Haixing suddenly took the initiative and took an 11-7 lead in the first half. Wuben caught up to 11-1. Wang Chunruo of Haixing served with force, scoring five points in a row. Then, Guan Liuzhu stood upside down and smashed the ball bravely, scoring points frequently. Wuben suffered this setback, and its spirit was dimmed and helpless. Haixing won 21-15.</p>
<h3>Haixing Suffers a Miserable Defeat in the Last Two Sets</h3>
<p>The first half of the third and fourth sets were very even. In the second half, Haixing was often careless, while Wuben was consistent and worked closely together, often saving the ball from danger. This is what Haixing lacks. Wuben won the first half of the third set 11-10. After switching sides, Haixing once took a 14-12 lead, but it was a flash in the pan. Wuben suddenly took the lead 17-14 and finally won the set 21-17. In the fourth set, Haixing won the first half 11-9. After that, Wuben surpassed. Ms. Zhang Biru served very well, often achieving success. Wang Xuehua often lost points due to touching the net, but she also scored a lot of points with her serves. As a result of this set, Wuben won again 21-17. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<p>Men's and Women's Track and Field Competitions and Ball Games All Begin Today</p>
<p>Districts 2 and 3 Have the Strongest Strength and Are Most Likely to Win the Men's and Women's Championship</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang, 18th Dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Games are scheduled to open in the province today (the 19th). Participating units include all 13 administrative districts of the province, with a total of 685 male and female athletes. All participants have reported and are residing in the Land Surveying Personnel Training Institute and the Provincial People's Education Hall Clubhouse. The games will last for four days, concluding on the 22nd. This is the third provincial games of Jiangsu Province, serving as a preliminary selection for this year's National Games. Athletes from all districts are the elite of their respective regions, and a competition is sure to bring about excellent performances.</p>
<p>Competing Units</p>
<p>The competition is organized by administrative inspectorate districts, with the counties under each unit as follows: District 1, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jurong, Jintan, Yangzhong, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangning; District 2, Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Jiangyin, Liyang; District 3, Wuxian, Changshu, Kunshan, Wujiang; District 4, Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Fengxian; District 5, Shanghai, Nanhui, Chuansha; District 6, Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan; District 7, Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Chongming, Qidong; District 8, Taixian, Dongtai, Taixing, Jingjiang; District 9, Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yizheng, Liuhe, Jiangpu; District 10, Yancheng, Funing, Xinghua; District 11, Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Siyang, Suqian; District 12, Tongshan, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Pixian, Suining; District 13, Donghai, Guanyun, Shuyang, Ganyu.</p>
<h3>Championship Categories</h3>
<p>The tournament championships are divided into male and female sections. The men's group includes seven categories: field events, track events, all-around, soccer, basketball, tennis, and volleyball. The women's group includes five categories: track and field, basketball, tennis, volleyball, and softball. The gender divisions with the most championship wins will each be awarded the overall championship. Chinese martial arts is a separate championship.</p>
<h3>District Strengths</h3>
<p>Comparing the past competition results of each district, the second and third districts have the strongest strength, followed by the first and sixth districts. Districts two and three are full of talented individuals, and many of them are outstanding. It is generally recognized that the overall championship will be contended for by these districts. The second district has a stronger hold on track and field all-around events, while the third district is slightly better in ball games. The first district has very few talented people, so its hopes are slim, but it may be able to get third place. The other districts have average results, making it difficult to distinguish between them. As for the individuals, there are notables such as Lu Yaxiong from the sixth district, Wang Wenjin from the second district in the sprint, long jump, Jin Zhongkang from the second district in long-distance running, Zhang Jia from the second district in the triple jump, Gui Zhongfei from the third district in the pole vault, and Zhu Mengchang from the third district in the triathlon.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>(Roar, China!) Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>The original author, S. Tretyakov, said: (These are all facts; I have not changed anything. Moreover, the case itself is a characteristic!)</p>
<p>Yes, these are facts, these are the facts that we are accustomed to seeing: this is a characteristic, but this is a characteristic that we have overlooked.</p>
<p>This familiarity with the facts and neglect of the characteristics can explain why the author of such a drama is Russian and not Chinese. Precisely because we are accustomed to the tyranny (of the white imperialists), it has become commonplace, and our writers have neglected it and do not see any characteristics. But to outsiders, especially Russians, it is naturally clear.</p>
<p>We do have (revolutionary literature) and (national literature). But what this literature always tells us is that certain (revolutionaries) and (national heroes) are leading and commanding, so the revolution has risen, and the national movement has risen. And then? We only see the joys and sorrows of the revolutionaries and national heroes, mostly interspersed with romance. As for the revolution and the national movement, it is always (in a place where the clouds are deep and one cannot tell).</p>
<p>This drama tells us the truth about (who is roaring?) (how did they start roaring?).</p>
<p>But I think the most useful lesson for us is the author's words: (Cities repeatedly saved from foreign cannons were finally destroyed by them in 1926.) If we want to preserve everything, we will ultimately fail, so we might as well break like jade. Therefore, the author loudly appeals (Roar, China!)</p>
<p>Regarding the public performance by the Drama Cooperative, I also want to say a few words. Namely, such a public performance is still far from the goal of (being demanded by the public). In China, such a ticket price can only be performed in the cities, and therefore can only be used as a momentary stimulant for the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>However, I do not intend to disrespect the current drama movement. I greatly admire the goal and the efforts. I only hope that those engaged in this movement will work harder to approach that goal.</p>
<h3>Fan Chengda and Liu Dabai</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Flipping through the Stone Lake Poetry Collection by chance, I feel that the (Grand Chancellor) Fan Chengda, who was (highly respected by all officials and famous throughout the world), is like Liu Dabai. Although he was an official, he was quite sympathetic to farmers, peddlers, beggars, and artisans. However, Liu Dabai was born in modern times, and his poems slightly add a bit of social thought, as if he is learning the latest fashion. Moreover, after becoming an official, he was unwilling to write poems like "Peddling Cloth Ballad," what he was willing to write about was how to improve official documents written in Mandarin. His beautiful old dream was shattered by the vulgar official language.</p>
<p>Speaking of Liu Dabai's old dreams, these are the same as those of many modern talented men and beautiful women, nothing more than things like love and revolution, commonplaces of new life that people repeat from others. It is not necessary to say that this is an old saying. He became the Vice Minister of Education, and the revolution can be considered a success, but he never compared the ancient version to what he longed for in the world. Although love has poetry as proof, I have not seen the sequel. Naturally, living in today's world, taking a concubine while being an official is something that should be in the "Official's Guide." Why bother with love in such a twisted manner?</p>
<p>Fan Chengda was also a refined official. When we read his Stone Lake lyrics, we can roughly see his enjoyment of life as a (young libertine) who (fears feeling old as flowers age). Because we already know that something called (lyrics) is precisely the living literature that was popular in that era, like the tunes of today's (light drizzle), which should be listed in the art of the leisure class. Without the fortune to enjoy the life of fine wine, beautiful women, and singing, one is out of touch with this type of art. Liu Dabai, who was born in modern times, refused to follow the poets of the light drizzle school, but wanted to fill in a few vernacular lyrics and become a pioneer of (the liberation of lyrics), which can be said to have misled others. Who has seen the sound of a piano in a modern dance hall singing lyrics of liberation?</p>
<p>It is said that Liu Dabai was impoverished after his death and almost had no way to arrange a funeral. If this is true, then it is something we should deeply lament. There seem to be few (disaster officials) who have become high officials and still have no money to buy a coffin after death. Although the Ministry of Education is a relatively clean government office, the minister and vice minister should not be so poor. Fan Chengda naturally became extremely wealthy when he became an official like a prime minister. He had a villa called Stone Lake, which was inscribed by the emperor, and he called himself the Stone Lake Recluse. His friend Yang Wanli said: (The scenery of Stone Lake is the most beautiful in the southeast.) So he was a big landlord. But I don't know if Liu Dabai, living in Hangzhou, had a villa on West Lake?</p>
<p>Liu Dabai's opposition to ghost-writing and writing vernacular poetry is not surprising after the May Fourth Movement. Fan Chengda happened to be born in an era when Taoist scholars and corrupt Confucianists were gradually rising, vernacular quotations came out, and Taoist poems close to the vernacular came out. Even the Jianghu poetry school, which used current events as allusions, also appeared. His poetry wanted to use simple and natural words, which is also nothing unusual. However, he liked to sing about pastoral landscapes and did not raise the bones of holy scriptures and virtuous traditions to scare living people, which is where he was a little more brilliant than those Confucian poets of his time.</p>
<p>I believe that Fan Chengda's pastoral poems can very well represent the feudal landlord class's appreciation, praise, longing for, and sorrow for the beauty of the countryside and nature. To use an analogy, it is like a wealthy person who is tired of eating chicken, duck, and fish and envies the vegetables and tofu eaten by the poor. However, from a small part of his poems, it can still be seen that he cares about the farmers who are trapped in difficulties and groaning at the bottom of the darkness. Opening granaries to provide disaster relief and ordering the elimination of locusts, although there are poems as proof, are ultimately official articles written as an official. "Urging the Rent Collection" writes about the corvée imposed by the village chiefs (grass sandal fee), and "Following Urging the Rent Collection" writes about the disaster victims being unable to pay taxes and even selling their clothes and daughters. These are all considered poems calling for the poor farmers. Also, the miserable cries of peddlers often made him sad, and he could not help but compose a poem. He said: (The medicine seller outside the wall has not missed a single day in nine years. His singing voice is very suitable. I asked him in the snow, and he has ten mouths in his family. If he does not go out for a day, he will be hungry and cold.) His poem is:</p>
<p>Ten mouths cry and blame deeply, how can they sit peacefully with felt needles. Loudly singing and yelling to deceive the wind and snow, it is not willing but bitter.</p>
<p>This seems to be much more brilliant than artists like Mr. Feng Zikai, who appreciate old and sick beggars like Millet's famous paintings (see "Random Notes from the Edge Hall"). Let me record two short poems by Stone Lake:</p>
<p>Driven out by hungry bellies, daring not to be idle? Snow legs and icy whiskers, accustomed to enduring the cold. It's not that they can't sit behind closed doors, enduring the cold is still bearable, but enduring hunger is difficult.</p>
<p>Crying and begging for a small amount is worth a thousand gold, frozen sparrows and hungry crows share the same sound. Laboring you to this point in life, what is the heart of the vast universe!</p>
<p>This was written when he heard the cries of those selling fish and vegetables outside the wall in the snow, who were struggling greatly to make a sale, and he was moved to write it. If he really attributed this social phenomenon of labor and poverty to the fortune of heaven, it would make modern revolutionaries laugh. Let me record another poem by him, "Singers on the River Market":</p>
<p>How can they be leisurely singing the "Weicheng Song"? There must be injustice in it. Pitying their hungry faces at dusk, they strongly pretend to be in the depths of spring, seeking friends' voices.</p>
<p>Fan Shihu also knew that the poor class had their cries of injustice. Therefore, I always feel that the speculative revolutionary poems of modern people like Liu Dabai, from "Peddling Cloth Ballad" onwards, have nothing remarkable. At most, it can only be said that their thoughts are a little more progressive than those of Bai Juyi and Fan Shihu, and they still have to thank the lessons of the times.</p>
<h3>Two Occasional Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>(1) Biographical Literature</p>
<p>I felt something after reading Mr. Yu Dafu's biographical literature a few days ago. I am writing it to ask for advice from several experts who write autobiographies and critical biographies.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu seems to regret that there is no better biography in the current literary world. In fact, this is only natural. What a biography needs is a thorough account of all the events and a calm, detached mind, so it is especially suitable to be written after death.</p>
<p>New literature has been popular for only a little over ten years at most. Most of the pioneering scholars are still alive, and some are in the process of transformation, starting anew (?). They used to ridicule and point fingers, but now they sing praises and support them. They used to abandon the main road, but now they have embarked on the broad road, from heretics to orthodoxy. Whether there will be further changes in the future, even Liu Bowen would find it difficult to predict. If one were to write a biography or account for them at this time, obliterating the causes and consequences, it would make people uneasy!</p>
<p>As for the popular ones on the market recently, they are mostly about where the person is from, how many brothers they have, how many bowls of rice they eat per meal, whether the nose is between the eyes, and so on. Other than that, there is no vitality at all, as if entering the mountain gate and looking up, everyone has the face of a Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>Originally, getting a few friends to praise each other, or praising famous people higher to advance oneself, is the origin of critical biographies. If no one writes a critical biography, or if what is said in the critical biography is not conducive to oneself, then one takes up the pen and blows oneself up in a majestic manner, which is said to be an autobiography.</p>
<p>Friends are afraid of hurting friendships, unknown writers want to take this opportunity to advance themselves, and people want to take the opportunity to promote themselves, all because of being alive.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we say that the yellow race is not inferior to the white race, then to have good biographies, one only needs to hope that those fickle famous people die sooner.</p>
<p>(2) Morality is Lost</p>
<p>It is said that starting from October 1st, the official documents of the provincial and municipal governments will use new punctuation marks. At the same time, lawyers' pleadings and court judgments will also be rewritten in the vernacular. As a result, those who care about the world will inevitably have more articles of lament on their pens.</p>
<p>This is really helpless. (Heaven is about to destroy culture), this is really helpless!</p>
<p>From the May Fourth Movement to the present, domestic traditional writing has been stumbling along, closely following the new literature, already exhausted. But this year is, after all, a memorable year. (Six or seven sage rulers appeared), some people advocate reading the classics, and others advocate restoration. In their spare time from politics, they form societies to compose poems. In this prosperous era of cultural governance, the descendants of Confucianism are all rejoicing, believing that the sage's doctrines will be seen again today.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, not long after, the (what-is-it-then) new literature was actually selected. This somersault has caused cries of suffering.</p>
<p>Therefore: (Alas, culture is lost!)</p>
<h3>Talk of a Bibliophile</h3>

<p>Ten years ago, I bought a copy of (Shi's Commentary on Du Fu's Poetry) with the handwriting of the Zha family of Jingxian County, a book collection, read by Zimu, and chapters by Zha Rihua, etc. When I returned home and flipped through it, I was overjoyed to find that it actually contained a business card of Mei Zengliang and a short note in Mei Zengliang's own handwriting. The short note read:</p>
<p>I am now packing my books, and there are quite a few that are too heavy. The Su Poetry that I bought for eight copper coins, if you need it, brother, I can let you have it, and I don't even need the original price. If you have already bought it, please let me know. I wish you a good day. Yours sincerely, Mei Zengliang.</p>
<p>At that time, I lent this note to the Commercial Press to be published in (Novel World) Volume 13. The business card was of course the old Chinese style, printed with the three characters (Mei Zengliang) in woodcut, on vermilion paper, with a few words added, which were for sending lotus root powder to Zha Zimu. From this, I knew that the (Su Poetry) I bought was actually from Mei Zengliang's collection. Famous people selling books, in this short note, can be said to have gained another interest.</p>
<h3>Shallow Lake (9)</h3>
<p>— Written by Joseph Conrad of England, Translated by Shi Hang</p>
<p>In this deep silence, Asad's voice vibrated high.</p>
<p>(I got her! I got her! To get her, I dare to face all mankind. But I got her! Then --</p>
<p>His words echoed towards the empty distance. He stopped, as if quietly listening to the sound disappearing into the distant distance -- there was no way to call it back. Then he said quietly --</p>
<p>(Tuan, I love my brother.)</p>
<p>A gust of wind made me shiver. Above his head, on the quiet sea of clouds, the palm leaves rubbed together, making a mournful and desperate sound. The white man spread his legs. His chin rested on his chest, and then he did not raise his head and muttered sadly --</p>
<p>(We all love our brothers.)</p>
<p>Asad shouted in a low but excited tone --</p>
<p>(What do I care about the death of others? What I want is peace in my own heart.)</p>
<p>He seemed to hear a sound in the house, listened quietly, and quietly walked in. The white man stood up. A gust of wind blew past with excitement. The stars flickered more dimly, as if they had retreated into the solidified depths of vast space. After a cold wind blew past, half the sky was completely silent and absolutely quiet. After that, behind the dark and winding lines of the forest, a pillar of golden light radiated from the heavens and spread into a semicircle on the eastern horizon. The sun rose. The clouds also cleared, forming floating fragments, and disappearing into thin flying breaths. At this time, the shallow lake was uncovered, and under the roots of the trees, in the thick shadows, it was dark and glowing. A white eagle, tilting upwards, flew into the clear intestinal light, showing a dazzling brilliance for a moment, and then flew higher, before it disappeared into the azure blue, becoming a thick black and static spot, as if it had left the world forever. The white man, standing in front of the door, stared at the world, and heard intermittent and chaotic murmurs in the hut, and finally a painful groan. Suddenly, Asad, with his hands outstretched, staggered out, trembling all over, his eyes fixed and standing still for a while. Then he said --</p>
<p>(She no longer has a fever.)</p>

<h3>Finance: The Plunge in Specie Continues Fiercely</h3>
<p>American Silver Exchange Stocks Soar Again; Guangdong Bankers' Liquidation Causes a Drop of Seventeen Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market has been in a continuous state of sharp decline. Yesterday, it remained unstable, mainly because the overseas silver market saw a decrease in British prices and an increase in American prices. Exchange rates saw the British pound rise 2.625 points against the US dollar, the US dollar rise 5.5 points against the British pound, the British pound fall 0.34 points against the French franc, and the US dollar rise 0.525 points against the French franc. On the Five Metals Exchange, forward silver prices rose from 0.8 to 1.1 points, stocks rose 2.69 yuan, American wheat rose 3.625 points, American cotton rose by a significant 14 basis points, and London raw gold remained unchanged. The opening price for raw gold immediately retreated to within 80 yuan. After the opening, it initially fell and then rose, but it was difficult to sustain. The Guangdong bankers' unloading further exacerbated the decline, but there was still some price support. Finally, news spread in the market that the Netherlands would begin discussing the gold standard issue on Tuesday. Although there was no actual connection, the exchange market suddenly became loose and weak at noon. The market broke through the 70 yuan mark in the afternoon, and the trend was quite dangerous. Banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, leveling the prices. While prices were fluctuating, fellow traders learned that the American evening newspapers reported favorable news, such as the US delaying its expansionary policy for three months and American gold exports. Banks took heart and selling interest waned. Eager to cover short positions, the gold price then began to rise. The current swap spread was adjusted to 300 yuan, from 8.2 yuan to 8.4 yuan. The market situation of the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 776.2 yuan, down 15.1 yuan from the previous Saturday's noon closing. Goods opened at 6.3 yuan.

Dadecheng, Zhifengyonghengyu sold, and the price retreated to within 5 yuan. Shenglai Hengxing also sold, but because the banks' appetite was quite good, although the price fell to 3.2 yuan, it still rebounded to outside 5 yuan, which was due to Yuanmao Yong and others buying. During the fluctuations, goods were sold heavily, and Hengyu, Fuyu, Zhengchang, Yuanchun, Zhifengyong sold one after another. January American gold at 0.5 yuan and 0.5625 were sold together, and the price dropped to 0.05 yuan. Qianchangxiang, Yuanxingyong took advantage of the low prices to buy strips, returning to 2.5 yuan. Hua Bi bought January American gold at 0.5625. Soon there were still few buyers at this price.

Yifengyong, Yuanshengyong, Hengyiyuanyangfengyong, Fushun goods, Fuyu and others bought strips together, and the price rebounded to 73.6 yuan. Banks all wanted December American gold at 0.375. The Da Mei Evening News had news of postponed inflation. Qingfayong sold slightly, falling 1.3 yuan, but because people's hearts turned firm, Zhengchang Zhifengyong still bought, scattered investors vigorously raised the price, and it rose to 5 yuan.

Compared to the previous Saturday, there was not much difference. The quoted price was increased by 300 yuan. Trading in the market was still active.

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market Is Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>The Lowest Record for Transaction Volume This Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was as dull as ever throughout the day. Trading became even more sparse, and the number of people gathering in the market was even smaller due to the bad weather. Because market prices did not move, both buyers and sellers had almost no place to start. Not only were people watching, but they didn't even bother to ask. The market was unbearably quiet. In the morning, the first round of trading showed a slight increase of only 5 fen or 1 jiao, which was consistent. In the second round, prices were mixed, but more rose than fell. In the afternoon, the market was even more chaotic and stagnant. Most market prices did not move at all, and often only one price was listed, with the difference between high and low prices being only 5 fen. The closing trading was especially light, with prices generally falling back by a small 5 fen or 1 jiao. Throughout the day, only the "Disarmament" forward contract saw some buying interest despite the low volume of transactions, raising the price by 3 jiao. The high market price was the highest of the day. Otherwise, recent contracts were slightly better by 5 fen, and forward contracts were slightly better by 1 jiao.

<h3>New York Stock Market Looks Up</h3>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 16th that the New York stock market was quite weak at the opening, but then became very active, led by gold mining stocks, after the Treasury Department announced that gold prices had reached a new high of 31.49 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,001,000 shares, indicating that the market could continue to look good next week. There were many transactions in silver, automobile, and oil stocks. The news on wheat was all positive from the buyers' side, but there were limited sellers, and the market was very crowded. There was strong demand for spot wheat, and the market was looking up due to talk of currency inflation. Cotton initially fell due to southern hedging and large sales of October futures, but rebounded and closed higher due to the strong stock market and exchange rates. Silver closed strong due to the prevalence of currency inflation talk. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 105.32 Up 2.69</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 50.38 Up 1.10</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 28.38 Up 0.53</p>
<p>40 Bonds 86.85 Down 0.12</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Flowers Ravaged by Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>丨Active Buyers Push Yarn and Cotton Flowers to Rise Together丨</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward and the situation is firmer. It is said that the mills are strongly maintaining their prices, leading to active buyers. In addition, excessive rain has led to a rise in the cotton market, which has stimulated the yarn market. As a result, sellers have decreased, but the surrounding environment is not good, and sellers still have no intention of making up for short positions. The future situation is highly uncertain.</p>
<h3>The Manpower Market Advances Lightly and Quickly</h3>
<p>The manpower market opened in the morning with a fairly flat mood. Bids for distant months were firm, with each month rising 7-8 jiao to 1.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market mood remained firm, with each month rising another 6, 7, or 8 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 40,700 bales. Yuan Da sold 1,150 bales, Ren Feng 1,000 bales, Yi Yu 900 bales, and Da Ji 800 bales. Huai Yi Cheng bought 1,150 bales, Zhen Da 1,000 bales, Yuan Da 1,800 bales, Da Chang 1,000 bales, and Xin Cheng 2,250 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Manpower Market Closing Prices and Changes Account Balance December 1846 Up 1.7 59,200</p>
<p>September 1807 Up 1.7 34,850 January 1855 Up 1.5 69,900</p>
<p>October 1820 Up 1.5 62,050 February 1861 Up 1.3 28,000</p>
<p>November 1835 Up 1.9 70,850 Total 324,850</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Reach 970 Bales</h3>
<p>More spot yarn was cleared than yesterday. Statistics show that all buyers bought a total of 970 bales, and the market price rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi 10 Shantou 45 Guangdong 225 Inland 265 Luzhou 70</p>
<p>North Group 10 Sichuan 200 Fujian 5 Peers 100 Zhenjiang 40</p>
<p>The cotton market is facing poor weather conditions, with frequent wind and rain. Most people believe that the cotton trees are currently flowering and that this wind and rain will inevitably reduce the harvest. As a result, buyers have become very active. Although US cotton has risen, the exchange rate has risen sharply, and the calculated silver prices have fallen. Therefore, some are inclined to sell and remain bearish. It is reported that goods are arriving daily in large quantities, and prices in the producing areas are slightly softer than before. If the wind and rain continue for a long time, the cotton market will be difficult to remain bearish.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard (Cotton) Rises Together by 6.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard (Cotton) market opened in the morning with a lack of sellers, and each month rose by 5 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the wind and rain were severe, and there were still many buyers, with each month rising by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 163,800 dan. Yuan Da sold 5,400 dan, Da Fu 6,900 dan, Tai Xing 4,800 dan, Tong Xing 8,500 dan, and Chang Feng 3,600 dan. Yuan Da bought 5,300 dan, Chang Feng 2,700 dan, Yu Chang 7,600 dan, Xin Cheng 4,300 dan, Yuan De 6,000 dan, Chun Ji 3,700 dan, and Tong He 2,100 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Prices and Changes Account Balance January 4045 Up 0.65 184,600</p>
<p>October 4065 Up 0.85 204,100 February 4050 Up 0.65 122,800</p>
<p>November 4040 Up 0.65 201,800 Total 936,700</p>
<p>December 4040 Up 0.75 198,500</p>
<h3>Factory Demand is Stagnant</h3>

<p>Shaanxi Cotton 41.50 Baoxing Factory purchased 106 pieces Spot delivery</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Transportation to Europe Shows Slight Progress</h3>
<p>Market activity was good last week. At the beginning of the week, speculators hoped for progress in overseas conditions and did not follow the decline in foreign cotton. As a result, the price difference between Bombay and Liverpool widened. Afterwards, US cotton rebounded, and Liverpool followed, closing the gap again. The spot market was generally quiet. Inquiries about transportation to Europe showed slight progress. Local factories are reselling various types of raw cotton. Weather reports indicate that recent heavy rains have slightly damaged the new cotton crop. The appendix below shows the statistics for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1932 1933</p>

<h3>Grains: Rumors of Increased Taxes on Foreign Rice and Wheat; Futures Flour and Wheat Accelerate Rapidly</h3>
<p>In the flour market, both the morning and afternoon openings showed a consistent and sharp rise, with foreign wheat prices rebounding by 1.1 yuan in Chicago and around 0.4 yuan in Canada. Therefore, the market mood had already stabilized at the opening. Then, rumors spread that the government would implement increased taxes on foreign rice and wheat, so outsiders were also encouraged, leading to exploitation. Prices for each month were better by over 1 fen. By the afternoon, the buying interest in each month was even more active. It was said that miscellaneous grain merchants from both local and foreign ports were buying particularly aggressively, causing near and far-term prices to soar step by step. On the mill side, it was heard that Fuxin had released a small amount, while others remained inactive. Tianjin quoted a small 0.2 fen, opening at 2.28 yuan. It was reported that Qinhuangdao had fallen by 0.4 fen. According to the actual sales locations, the market remained weak. Therefore, this increase is still likely due to market sentiment. As a result, the current month was up 2.5 fen compared to the previous week, October was up 3.25 fen, November/December were up 3.375 fen, January was up 3.25 fen, and February was up 4 fen.</p>
<p>In the wheat market, the morning and afternoon openings showed an initial stabilization followed by a sharp rise, with foreign wheat prices rebounding by 0.4 yuan to 1.1 yuan. Therefore, the market sentiment had already stabilized at the opening. Then, rumors spread that foreign rice and wheat would be subject to increased taxes, with a proposed increase of 1.5 yuan per dan of rice. Grain traders from both local and foreign ports paid attention to this situation, and buying in each month also turned smooth, causing market prices to soar step by step. Although flour sales remained sluggish, speculators did not consider whether this kind of relief would be needed in the future. As a result, the current month rose by 8 fen, and October to January rose by 9 fen. The spot wheat market has entered a stable state, with continuous arrivals and active mill demand. Wuhua wheat opened at 3.93 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 3.89 yuan, Dongtai wheat at 3.78 yuan, Tong wheat at 3.78 yuan, second grade at 3.73 yuan, Huangqiao wheat at 3.83 yuan, Liuhe wheat at 3.63 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.63 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.73 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 3.57 yuan, Puzhen wheat at 3.6 yuan, and Wuhu wheat at 3.5 yuan. Fuxin released 5,000 bales, Shenda released 5,000 bales, and Xinda took 1,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Turns Around and Rises by Over a Jiao</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources. The rain made people more firm, so the long-tired trend suddenly showed vitality. Other wholesalers were quite active, with a total of over 2,000 bales purchased. The sellers also immediately shouted up the prices, so all thick and thin japonica rice, as well as Du Yangjian and new Jian rice, rose by 1-2 jiao, and the trend is still expected to continue to rise. Changing from cloudy weather can raise the price by a jiao. Heshang new japonica rice is also good for a jiao. The factory's new Dongtian rice rose by 2 jiao, opening at 7 yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) There were about 22-23 sources from Heshang. The market was lively and the market price was higher for white rice. Higher-quality rice was nearly a foot high. The price for early thin rice, Chen Du sheep, and guest rice did not change much. The price for Dongguan new japonica rice and Baiyuan Xinyan rice added 1-2 jiao. Tujian Xin, Yangjian Chen, and Bujian Lingri rice prices followed, adding almost a foot.</p>
<h3>New Machine Xian (Rice) Suddenly Rises by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>丨Shantou Merchants Smoothly Handle Railway Xian...Ningbo Merchants Rush to Load Chen Xiaojiao丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian (rice) market price rose immediately due to the impact of the rumor of increased dumping tax on foreign rice. Demand was also strong, and sentiment was upward. The implementation of the dumping tax has already been reported, but it has not yet been agreed upon. Now, the authorities are actively proceeding with it because the domestic flour price is falling and the rural areas are in danger. Yesterday, according to news from the Guangzhou Chaozhou Shantou merchants, Guangdong Province first implemented the opening of a small tax, collecting a dumping tax of one yuan per 100 catties of foreign rice. Calculating at 150 catties per stone, it would be necessary to add 1.5 yuan. Future sources would inevitably be cut off, and with the foreign rice route cut off, they would only seek the output of the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan in the country's producing areas. The Chaozhou merchants were smoothly processing the Wuhu, and yesterday, the Wuhu prices soared by more than half a yuan. It is said that the Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi provinces are contacting Hunan Province to directly handle the loading, so the producing areas are all reporting price increases. The rice in Shanghai is especially noted by the Southern merchants. The new Heshang rice has already been inquired about by Guangdong and Fujian. Customers Xian bought 1,000 bales of Nanjing railway Xian by the Shantou merchants yesterday, with the price at 7.1 to 7.02 yuan. The Shantou merchants were still in the initial trial stage. The Fujian merchants were processing 1,000 bales of Kunshan sheep at a price of 7.3 to 7.18 yuan. 115 bales of Hunan machine Jing were purchased at a price of 7 yuan, and 109 bales of brown rice were purchased at a price of 5 yuan jiao ban. Chen Xiaojiao, who had long been abandoned by the customers, was rushed to be processed by the Ningbo merchants yesterday at a price that had returned to 6.75 yuan, which was 7 fen higher than last week. It is said that the Xiang Jing machine Xian suddenly rose by more than half a yuan.</p>
<h3>New Yellow Beans are Scarce and the Market is Stable</h3>
<p>New yellow beans were previously sluggish due to the surge of goods, but recently, not many have arrived, and the inventory has been thin. Sales have also been sluggish. Yesterday, the total market turnover was over 300 bales of Jiujiang beans, 600 bales of Hankou beans, one vehicle of Changzhou beans, and 400 bales of Jiangbei beans. Therefore, the market cannot improve, only slightly better by 2-3 fen compared to before.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Camphor Oil Market Depressed</h3>
<p>Camphor oil is usually in high demand during the autumn harvesting season, so the market is typically active after autumn. Traders anticipate that autumn sales will boost the market and prices will rise. However, contrary to expectations, sales have remained sluggish even after autumn. Although the supply from Wuhan is limited, the total inventory exceeds 30,000 dan (a unit of weight). Compared to past Wuhan market trends, this is not a large amount, but the slow sales are unprecedented. Those with inventory are understandably anxious. According to yesterday's information from Wuhan, premium camphor oil has dropped by about 22 yuan, while standard camphor oil is slightly above 21 yuan, and Macheng camphor oil is at 20.07-0.08 yuan, a decrease of about one yuan compared to last week. Shanghai merchants, anticipating autumn sales, have maintained substantial inventories. However, due to sluggish sales and widespread reports of weakness in various regions, selling prices have been continuously reduced. Although the trade association has set a fixed price, it is treated as a mere formality, and the market prices are in complete disarray.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Yellow and White Filature Supplementing French Orders</h3>
<p>(Abundant Autumn Cocoon Shipments to Shanghai from Zhejiang) The autumn cocoon markets in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang province are gradually closing. The fresh cocoons collected by various cocoon merchants are being dried and actively transported to Shanghai by both land and water routes. Recently, the section of the Suzhou Creek near the Laopo Bridge has been filled with barges loaded with autumn cocoons, and the warehouses at the South Railway Station are also packed with cocoon bales. The transportation situation is no less bustling than during the spring cocoon season. (Eri Silk Thread Costs are Not Low) Xunzhen (Nanxun and Zhenze) and other places are major producers of Eri silk thread. This year, the price of local silk is high, and silk production is not strong. In the past few months, only 758 bales of dried Eri silk thread have been shipped to Shanghai. The cost of new silk this season is over 700 yuan per bale.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Can Be Considered Good) Due to foreign exchange constraints, the price of artificial silk continues to decline. However, sales are still reasonably strong. Yesterday, Jin Qilin (Golden Kirin), Black Beauty, First Grade Red Fish, and other brands were imported from Tianjin with 40 cases of forward goods at a price range of 179.75 to 178.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Filature Sales to France Slightly Active) Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign merchants' silk market saw slight activity in sales to France due to continued strong price increases in overseas silk markets, with French firms replenishing their stocks of yellow and white filature silk. New York silk telegraphs were not transmitted, and American firms were waiting for the right time to act. Yesterday, Sincere &amp; Co. and others imported 40 bales of white filature silk and 20 bales of Shandong filature silk at firm prices.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants' Tea Market Turning Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign merchants' tea market turned quiet. British and French merchants have not received responses to the large number of telegrams they sent last week. In addition, yesterday's severe storms and dark skies made it difficult to evaluate various teas. As a result, the standard market became increasingly deserted. Only Tongfu, Yongxing, and other firms, as well as the Russian tea cooperative, purchased a total of over 800 chests of Zhen Mei (Precious Eyebrow) and Gong Xi (Tribute Happiness) teas, with little change in prices.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sudden Rise in the Price of Melton Cloth</h3>
<p>Melton cloth is most popular in the autumn sales season. Tailors in this district must rush to meet demand until early winter. In addition to the Sichuan merchants, other merchants are currently selecting goods. Melton cloth comes in two colors, Yuan (black) and Chang (navy blue). The inland and local markets mostly sell navy blue, while Sichuan merchants specialize in Yuan (black). The import cost of new goods is quite high, and current selling prices are mostly for old stock. Anyone selling new stock would inevitably incur losses. Due to the abundance of existing inventory, it has been difficult to raise prices. Most merchants who have placed orders have untold grievances. However, the market showed a turnaround yesterday, especially for those holding large stocks of Yuan (black) Melton cloth, who raised prices externally. The sudden rise is attributed to purchases by merchants from Beiping (Beijing). It is said that merchants from Beiping need a large number of Yuan (black) Melton cloth for uniforms, requiring approximately 3,000 to 4,000 yards, and several firms are sourcing it. This has led those holding inventory to become active and collectively raise prices.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Recent Import and Export Report</h3>
<p>Silk and Tea Exports</p>
<p>(Yangtze River) Imports: In the past two days, approximately 800 pieces of tobacco leaves from Hankou, over 400 pieces of machine-spun cotton, and a total of over 500 barrels of tung oil and tea oil have arrived. Huangdou (soybeans) (400+ bags) and green beans (100+ bags) and eggs (300+ baskets) came from Jiujiang and Wuhu. In addition, there are over 1,000 pieces of tea leaves, which will be shipped to Yingkou and then to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>(Overseas) Approximately 3,000+ pieces of machine oil, iron bars, hardware, and paper arrived from Europe. Exports yesterday included 390 bales of Huzhou silk, 79 pieces of silk waste, 28 pieces of silk fabrics, 16 pieces of sheep intestines, 82 pieces of egg yolks, over 10 pieces of human hair, 85 pieces of cotton yarn waste, 2,375 pieces of tea leaves, and 170 bags of stone powder. 80 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to South America.

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Sick</h3>
<p>Dry Preface</p>
<p>The weather these past few days has been especially hot, and then the cold suddenly comes very quickly. Now the wind is blowing, now there are a few raindrops. Yu, who has always been physically weak and rushes about the streets all day, could not help but catch a cold and get sick. Sick, really sick!</p>
<p>In order to live, in order to earn bread, although he suffers from stomach problems, he cannot rest like wealthy people who are used to being pampered; nor is he fortunate enough to be admitted to a hospital; he cannot even raise the money to buy medicine. He only (drags), no mistake, (dragging) is a poor person's helpless but wonderful way of dealing with (sickness)!</p>
<p>However, now he has failed, (dragging) can no longer be effective against the disease demon; even if he wants to live, to earn bread, the evil disease is no longer allowing him to. Although he is very anxious, it is no use, he can only sleep in bed, in a small room of less than ten feet around, with a window hole as small as a dog's kennel, stifling so that he can't breathe!</p>
<p>At this moment, he stared at the ceiling, a slow, slight pain brewing in his stomach, his body running a high fever, his heart longing for the life to come. Poverty and disease intertwined to form a tight net, deeply enveloping him. The raindrops outside the window were still tapping on the window panes, and the ruthless wind continued to blow fiercely.</p>
<p>He has no friends, let alone relatives. He is alone in Shanghai. If he does not work for a day, he will go hungry, so he has no savings. He did not anticipate this sudden illness. Therefore, he has no money to hire a doctor, let alone a way to ward off the disease demon. He can only wait for the natural evolution of the disease!</p>
<p>When he is awake, everything in front of him is very quiet. There are no smiling faces, no hypocritical expressions, no red-headed foreign devils, let alone women's legs; what his eyes come into contact with is only the ceiling, the airtight window panes, and simple utensils. But his ears are busy: the music from the radio, the hawkers' shouts, the urgent sound of ambulance bells, the sound of wind and rain hitting the poor... all of it pounding his eardrums, making him annoyed and impatient! But there is no way out.</p>
<p>He also has moments of confusion, and dreamlike emotions run up his mind: he thinks of his hometown, he thinks of his deceased parents, and even more of his wandering brothers. He seems to have slipped and fallen into a deep abyss, startling him into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>This 丨sweat丨 seems not to be without benefit to him, or perhaps it is because he has been resting for several days, the cold has gradually subsided, the fever has gradually subsided, although his body is still pitifully weak, but for the sake of earning bread, the lonely and unrecovered he, had to drag his weak body again and embark on the journey of struggle.</p>
<h3>Customs of Fuzhou: Marriage</h3>
<p>Chen Yu</p>
<p>The day before or two days before a woman gets married, she must, as a rule, perform the trick of "abstaining from grains." The purpose of this is nothing more than to prevent her from urinating or defecating in the sedan chair or at the groom's house. If such a thing unfortunately happens, it will not only be impossible to solve, but the groom's family will also consider it an ominous sign; or as a result, their relationship will be discordant and a tragedy will occur. It is truly (unfortunate to be born a daughter)!</p>
<p>The night before the wedding, the daughter and mother both cry (with great joy)! The way of crying is not the way we usually wail loudly when stimulated; nor is it the sobbing and weeping of (shedding tears in secret). It is a small song of (question and answer) that is both crying and not crying: the mother often sings: "Sister, oh sister, when you go to someone else's house, you must listen to the (tangbu)'s mouth, oh sister!" "Listening to the tangbu's mouth means obeying the husband's words." "Mother, oh mother, the daughter is young and does not know etiquette, oh mother!" (In Fuzhou, the mother is usually called (mother). The daughter answers in this way as a rule. If you don't know this custom, listening to this little song is really baffling! When she is about to get married, the mother must first take care of the two procedures of washing her hair and shaving her face for her daughter, and then push her out of the main hall. At this time, the parents sit upright in the hall, and the daughter kneels down on both knees to express her gratitude for the kindness of raising her. At the same time, the two elders must put on her the (veil) (a kind of hat worn by women when they get married), and then she officially gets into the sedan chair. But when she is about to get into the sedan chair, the daughter often acts as if she does not want to go, and is pushed by her family members again and again, as if she is very reluctant to get into the sedan chair.</p>
<p>When the sedan chair starts to move, the family members all see her off with tearful eyes. Only the mother and her daughter in the sedan chair repeat their old tune of last night. At the same time, the mother also holds a lot of melon seeds or wheat and throws them randomly at the top of the sedan chair. This action has two meanings, one (melon seeds) is to express that after the daughter gets married, she will have sons and daughters and her descendants will be numerous; one (wheat) is to express that the daughter will not starve in the future. But at this time, there is a contradictory behavior, that is, as soon as the sedan chair leaves the door, they must block the door, as if if they are a little slower, the so-called (feng shui) will definitely be sucked away by her. Such superstition is really rare.</p>
<p>When the bridal sedan chair is about to arrive at the groom's house, the groom and his father must avoid it. It is said that when the bridal sedan chair enters the door, there is a kind of (killing energy) that specializes in killing them. If they do not avoid it and are hit by it, even if they do not die, they will at least be half dead from illness.</p>
<p>The sedan chair is placed in the hall. At this time, the groom's family must call a child of about seven or eight years old to stand in front of the sedan door and ask her to get out of the sedan chair. With obligation comes natural right, and the bridesmaid (the bride's companion) will give him a package of gifts (usually money) prepared by her in the bride's house to express her gratitude. At this time, the groom has come out, and the so-called grand ceremony of four bows and eight prostrations is carried out at this time. However, the groom must know a little when bowing, that is, do not kneel down on the seventh bow or the last bow to show the meaning of (male superiority to female inferiority). If not, it will inevitably be ridiculed by the guests.</p>
<p>Then the so-called (sitting on the bed) is carried out. What is called (sitting on the bed)? It is the way they point (male left and female right), sitting silently by the bed. At this time, there is a very interesting thing, whether male or female, they all want to pull the other's lapel to sit under their own buttocks. The intention is that in this way, the other party will definitely obey him or her in the future. I remember not long ago, I had a relative whose head was not very clear. When he got married, his friends coaxed him and said (if the bride pulls your lapel to sit on, you must stand up to show your disapproval). He actually did it as he was told, and as a result, the lapel was torn by half a foot.</p>
<p>Modern Celebrity Paintings and Calligraphy</p>
<p>Mr. Diao Qiusheng (Brief History)</p>
<p>Shi Lin, style name Sheng, also known as Changlu, is currently working at the No. 2 New Spinning Factory in Shanghai West. The time spent sitting on the bed is very short, at most about a quarter of an hour. At this time, the bridesmaid calls the groom (to lift the crown) (to pull down the bride's crown), and at the same time calls many guests to appreciate the true colors of the newlyweds. Then the bride changes her clothes, and after changing her clothes, they walk out of the hall and carry out the trick of (knocking on the bamboo pole). The so-called (knocking on the bamboo pole) is that the groom desperately pulls family members or guests and wants them to sit upright in the hall and accept his and her bow. After the bow, they must give a gift. At this time, the guests and family members run east and west (except for parents or grandmother), which is very interesting!</p>
<p>After (knocking on the bamboo pole), they both go to the kitchen to worship the (God of the Kitchen). At this time, no matter how delicate you are, the bride must go to the well or the river to fetch two buckets of water to show that she can take on the responsibility of running the household.</p>
<p>In the evening, the wedding night party starts as usual. The procedure for the party is that the guests stand by the door, knock on the door with their hands, and sing the so-called (wedding door poem). When they sing to a certain extent, the bridesmaid will open the door and let them in. If you can't sing, then don't even think about making a fuss. The ways of making a fuss are probably all about ordering plays, such as (Li Taibai taking off his boots), (Guanyin dripping dew), and so on. If they do not follow the words of the guests at this time, it is to (shame) them and call them to (take back the cage arm) ( (shame) and (take back the cage arm) both mean to lose face), this kind of (shame) and (take back the cage arm) is no small matter, and often as a result, relatives lose their feelings. Therefore, the groom and bride must implement it no matter what. I remember that a friend of mine in the past, when he got married, his relatives wanted to see the bride's navel. The bride was certainly unwilling, but she was afraid that the relationship with her relatives would break down, so she had to cut a hole in the middle of a whole set of new clothes with scissors towards the navel. The guests were of course very happy, but the next day the bride hanged herself. In the 20th century, this kind of bad habit is still left over, which is really (outrageous)?</p>
<p>The wedding night party must last until one or two o'clock in the evening before it can end. After the end, they naturally prepare to sleep. But at this time, the bridesmaid comes out and knocks on the groom's bamboo pole. She takes a square piece of red cloth (called (number one scholar bag) in Fuzhou dialect, used for intercourse that night) and gives it to him, asking him to reward her. No matter what, she refuses to leave, intentionally delaying your precious night. There is also a strange example, that is, at this time, if there is money in the groom's pocket, no matter how much, it will be searched and taken away by her, and he cannot resist.</p>
<p>The next day, the bride's family, as a rule, will send someone to invite them to a (double trip) (inviting a double trip means inviting them to go to the bride's house together), but it cannot be overnight, no matter how far the journey is. They all have to come back. After that, there are still (inviting for three days), (inviting for ten days), (inviting for a full month), etc., inviting them with great joy! However, most of the invitations are for single trips, and the groom usually does not participate, so they are both unwilling, but the custom is like this, and they have to do it. It is really pitiful!</p>
<h3>Resignation</h3>
<p>Wei Fan has decided to leave. In the small room where he lived, there was only a table, a chair, and a bed facing the door. Today, everything in the room has been tidied up by him. The setting sun reflects back from the opposite wall, making it even more refreshing. There is nothing on the table, and it is very clean. Two boxes and a well-tied bedding are placed flat in front of the bed. There is only a tattered empty tent left on the bed. He sits leaning on the chair, his eyes staring straight at the luggage that is already prepared and placed in front of the bed, motionless, envisioning the fate and situation he will encounter after leaving his job. Suddenly, he stands up, his feelings seem to be more determined, stomps his foot, and mumbles:</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Yes, Wei Fan's profession has made him too unsatisfied. He has been working at the T Factory in C Port for a full four years. He was not very satisfied when he first came with a monthly salary of eight yuan, and it has not increased at all until now. Moreover, recently the manager of T Factory, on the pretext of poor business, issued a notice of (paying wages at 80% off). How could he bear it? After a long period of deliberation, Wei Fan decided not to continue his current job.</p>
<p>(What am I doing? Am I spacing out? I ran out from thousands of miles away for a job with no hope for the future and a monthly salary of a few dollars? ... I'm not doing it! Resign! To hell with it!) He wrote a letter to his uncle in Shanghai, who had introduced him before, explaining his distress that he had to resign, and asked him to find another way for him as much as possible, but he did not dare to resign, so he asked the manager for four weeks' leave, preparing to see his uncle.</p>
<p>Now he is all prepared. He will rest in the room for a while, and wait for the boat to Shanghai tonight to leave the place where he has been for less than four years.</p>
<p>The journey was very peaceful. On the evening of the second day, Wei Fan found himself in the living room of his uncle's house. He met his uncle. He reiterated his previous intention in a tactful manner, with dry lips and tongue, and explained in detail the reasons why he had to resign and the hopeless situation for the future. As a result, his uncle, in addition to telling him that industry and commerce were declining and there was a surplus of people with no other way to think about, also told him decisively to return to the factory when his leave was over.</p>
<p>(Yes, there is no way! Industry and commerce are declining, and there is a surplus of people. What way can I think about?) Wei Fan carefully tasted his uncle's threatening words, and at the same time thought: (Unless I go home and eat old rice, but what about the criticisms of relatives and the situation of the family? What should I do?)</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>One evening four weeks later, Wei Fan's slender shadow was repeatedly reflected on the wall of his small room in the T Factory.</p>

<p>Confidential Secretary, around 20 years old.</p>
<p>University President, around 40 years old.</p>
<p>Peace Delegate, under 35 years old.</p>
<p>Maid, around 19 years old.</p>
<p>Setting: A section of a large Western-style house. The stage is about two and a half, with a large, ornate living room on the right. A staircase at the back leads to the upstairs bedrooms. Next to the staircase hangs a velvet curtain, leading to the inner living room. A door on the right wall leads to the corridor. There is also a door on the left wall, leading to other rooms in the house. The left is a protruding part. Vines climb the walls. There is a window on the far left. Above is a balcony on the second floor.</p>
<p>When the curtain opens, the stage is empty. The entire stage is diffused with a soft glow. The room is filled with an atmosphere of peace.</p>
<p>The balcony and walls on the left still reflect intense sunlight. Soon, the Military Authority pulls aside the velvet curtain and comes out of the living room, walking towards the stairs. Behind him follows the young Confidential Secretary, carrying a briefcase, as he is about to go out on important business.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Go take a trip. The main thing is to find out what his opinion is.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: Yes. (Goes straight to the door on the right of the stage and exits. The Military Authority also slowly walks up the stairs. The intoxicating sound of a record playing can be heard. Soon after, the Maid exits from the door next to the staircase on the left wall, clearing away teacups and fruit platters. She is followed by the Stable Boy, cracking melon seeds.)</p>
<p>Maid: How about it? Young Master! Call me "Big Sister" and I'll give you an American orange to eat.</p>
<p>Stable Boy: Big Sister!</p>
<p>Maid: Oh! What a good little brother. (Throws him an orange.) You have to be more obedient in the future!</p>
<p>Stable Boy: Oh! Look! You're really putting on airs now. When have I ever not listened to you? Is there even a need to say it?</p>
<p>Maid: Hmph, still arguing. Last night I told you not to run to my room, but why did you sneak in again? Is that what you call listening?</p>
<p>Stable Boy: Now that I've eaten an orange, I'll be obedient.</p>
<p>Maid: Stop talking nonsense. I'm asking you, if the Japanese soldiers really invade, what do you plan to do? Our Madam is really anxious.</p>
<p>Stable Boy: What's so hard about that? I'm only afraid they won't invade.</p>
<p>Maid: Why?</p>
<p>Stable Boy: Isn't it obvious? If they really invade, then everyone will flee. The Master and Madam will flee, and we will flee too. If they're not careful, we can slip away privately and live a good life. Don't you think that's great?</p>
<p>Maid: Oh my, you make it sound so good. There isn't a single man we can rely on.</p>
<p>Stable Boy: Can't you rely on me? You just watch. If I, Little Wang, say it, I'll do it. I'm just afraid the Japanese soldiers won't invade, then there's no way to do it.</p>
<p>Maid: Yes, it seems you're just a coward. It looks like we have to make a vow before the Bodhisattva, hoping the Japanese soldiers will come so we can run, otherwise we'll be stuck being servants here for life. Is that it?</p>

<h3>Clark Gable Seriously Ill</h3>
<p>— Hel</p>
<p>Exposure to Cold and Dampness While Hunting Causes Lung Problems - Return to Hollywood, Appendicitis Flare-Up</p>
<p>Clark Gable, once celebrated as the epitome of masculinity, is now seriously ill. American film magazines are full of reports of his condition. One magazine said, "While we cannot say that Clark Gable will never return to the screen, we have investigated and determined that if he is to return, it will be at least several months, certainly not a few weeks, before he can be expected to recover. The studio is very anxious for him to recover quickly and is promoting the story that he refused to co-star with Joan Crawford in 'No Woman Wanted' because he didn't like the script, using his illness as an excuse. In reality, Clark Gable's illness is not an excuse, but a genuine illness, and a very serious one at that."</p>
<p>Clark Gable's illness was caused by his recent hunting trip. He is extremely fond of outdoor sports. Whenever he had a vacation or a break from filming, he would invite many friends to go hunting or fishing in the mountains. However, in the past, many people would go with him, including both men and women, and Clark's wife would always participate. Because his wife and other women were with him, Clark always felt that he wasn't having as much fun. He said, "One day, I'll take a good friend and go hunting, and really enjoy myself. I hate it when women follow behind and tell men 'Be careful!' 'That gully is too dangerous, don't go!' or 'That peak is too steep, don't go!' 'Don't get your shoes wet!' as if men were three-year-old children." So this time, Clark Gable only invited Dr. Dolph to go with him.</p>
<p>They had a great time for the first few days. No one told them not to do this or not to do that, and no one was watching them. They really went where they wanted to go and did what they wanted to do, completely uninhibited. Sometimes, they weren't ready to return to their tents until late at night, their hunting enthusiasm still unspent. As for whether their socks were wet or not, and all the other nagging they usually heard, they would think about it and laugh.</p>
<p>One day, they returned extremely exhausted. They had suffered so much hardship and encountered so much danger in one day, and they had also waded through several rivers. They returned to their tent soaked in water and sweat, wanting to change clothes. But they were too tired, so they lay down on the bed and fell asleep. They slept for several hours. When they woke up, it was late at night, and the weather was cold. They felt cold and damp all over. Of course, they didn't care about a little cold or a little cough. But the little cold and little cough got deeper and deeper, and it was clear that the cold air had entered their lungs. By the time morning came, they couldn't continue hunting. So they decided to return to Hollywood, get their bodies healthy, and then continue their fun.</p>
<p>The doctor was fine, but when Clark Gable arrived in Hollywood, he had several sore spots on his back. He lay in bed, and the pain gradually moved downwards. By the next day, both of his feet were so painful that he couldn't move them. The studio didn't know about his condition and sent someone to ask him to continue filming the almost-completed "Hold Your Man." Clark Gable immediately put the public interest first, gritted his teeth, and endured the pain to film the few remaining scenes in one go. The camera was rolling, and Clark was struggling. When the filming was over, he collapsed. He was taken home in an ambulance.</p>
<p>So they quickly called in specialists and used X-rays to examine all parts of his body. The result was that he was diagnosed with typhoid fever and other ailments, as well as a sudden attack of appendicitis. But with his condition like this, they couldn't possibly operate on him again. Since news of his condition spread, the entire Hollywood community has been shaken. Many people are praying for him to recover quickly. But this is not an illness from which he can recover in a few weeks. It will be at least several months or half a year before he can return to the film set.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "The Penguin Pool Murder"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Almost every detective film is the same. The main thing is to use the trick of adults deceiving children, interweaving the plot in a bizarre and tortuous way, filled with doubt, so that the audience watches with bated breath to find out who the murderer is.</p>
<p>This RKO Pictures production, "The Penguin Pool Murder," is the same. First, it raises suspicions of rape and murder, then a corpse is discovered, and then the police arrest several suspects. Then, thanks to the clever research of a detective and a female teacher, clues are slowly found. Unfortunately, just when the case is about to be solved, the witness is brutally murdered. In the end, thanks to the female teacher's clever plan, the truth is revealed: the murderer is the lawyer defending the accused.</p>
<p>I remember Paramount's "The Benson Murder Case" was largely the same, with the detective as the murderer, using his talent and eloquence to incriminate the innocent. The similarity is that the lawyer or detective, who is supposed to protect civil rights, is actually the murderer.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is a manifestation of the contradictions of modern society. If the author's intention is to expose this, then it is undoubtedly worthy of praise. However, we believe that the author wrote the script in this way simply to make the plot more bizarre and novel, in an attempt to win the audience's applause. Because of this, the detective and the lawyer are inevitably used as sources of ridicule.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, perhaps the author wanted to use this play to offer sincere advice to those responsible for society, hoping to improve this contradictory phenomenon. However, in "The Penguin Pool Murder," the point of earnest advice is not emphasized, which can be said to be very weak. Moreover, this is a fundamental contradiction in modern society and cannot be eliminated with a few soft words. Therefore, the author's efforts are ultimately unrewarding.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this film is quite well-equipped with the main conditions for a detective film. But overall, the director's handling of the plot is really not powerful. So much dialogue, that to American audiences it would allow them to close their eyes and listen as if it was Radio, but to Chinese audiences, they can only doze off in the theater. In addition, the so-called tension, apart from the strange bird sounds at night and the moment in court, is all very forced and loses the effect of tension.</p>
<p>The author used Edna May Oliver and James Gleason as the protagonists, naturally wanting to use their awkward faces to make the plot lively. But unfortunately, due to the script's decision, they couldn't enliven it. We believe that none of the characters here is worthy of special praise, and the director's technique is just as mediocre overall.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to talk about the social basis for producing detective films.</p>
<p>Since modern society is so corrupt, it is an undeniable fact. There is no possibility of boasting and embellishment, and it is unbearable to expose ugliness. So, on the one hand, there are some farmer-consciousness martial arts works, and at the same time, the so-called detective films can allow the audience to unconsciously spend some extra time. If this is used to show the progress of science and use science to solve bizarre cases, then science is just used as an ornament on the screen.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Seeing "Man Jiang Hong"</h3>
<p>— Qiran</p>
<p>Forcing a very long classical novel into a film script, naturally, there is danger of failure everywhere. However, this adaptation of "Man Jiang Hong," though still inevitably a bit stiff and forced in places, unexpectedly achieved considerable success. This, I think, is perhaps the result of the efforts of the script editors and directors.</p>
<p>We all know that the lifeline of old novels largely depends on the word "fate" in "(those who are destined will meet even from a thousand miles away)". Since ancient times, the meeting of talented scholars and beautiful women has been because their "fate" contains "fate". After meeting, they are bound to fall in love at first sight. This "Man Jiang Hong" is a classical novel, so it cannot be an exception to this point. Like the relationship between Shui Cun and Tao Zhi, there is "fate" at play everywhere. Because there is too much "fate", it becomes coincidence. Too many coincidences cause a loss of truthfulness, and the power of a work that loses truthfulness becomes weak.</p>
<p>What era is this! In this era, everyone is shouting that movies should enlighten the way out for those who have gone astray. To what extent does "Man Jiang Hong" achieve this? Does it enlighten the way out for those who have gone astray? No, it only depicts the laziness, idleness, weakness, and fear of the petty bourgeoisie. Although it intentionally and reluctantly makes Shui Cun realize at the end, in the end he still cannot help but drown in anguish and die!</p>
<p>Cheng Bugao is much more progressive here than in "Raging Torrent." That kind of cheerful and gentle tone added a lot of interest to the audience. The fact that he can keep the audience sitting for two hours without getting bored is indeed a rare thing.</p>
<h3>The Adaptation of "Man Jiang Hong"</h3>
<p>— Lin Ding</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Here I would like to talk about some issues of adapting the original book with Mr. Wang Qianbai, the adapter of the screenplay. It is undeniable that if an audience member read the original novel, will almost suspect that the Man Jiang Hong seen on the silver screen is another similar story. Of course, trying to move four thick volumes of a novel to a few thousand feet of film is indeed a difficult task. However, since we already know the difficulty, we should not ignore the essence of the original book. For example: the name of the original book is "Man Jiang Hong," and the main point is the "Man Jiang Hong" performed in the dance troupe, leading to the ending of the ship fire, in order to take care of the original meaning of the book's title. But in the Man Jiang Hong on the silver screen, it almost makes people feel that it is somewhat off-topic. I believe that the editor should have inserted this, even if it meant shortening some of the interactions between Wan Youguang and Tao Zhi. Because the capitalists' playing with women can be clearly understood by the audience from the positions of Wan Youguang and Tao Zhi, and since this is for the sake of economy on the film, it would be more appropriate to sacrifice this. There was no consciousness at all in the original book, but the adapter could not bear to give up the original subject matter and also wanted to infuse some new consciousness, resulting in the entire "Man Jiang Hong" play being scattered and unbearable. For example, Tao Zhi on the silver screen struggled out of the hands of the capitalists, and died in the arms of her lover. Although this is more powerful than Tao Zhi's drowning and death in the original book, it also tells a person that when there is no way to deal with reality, there is only confused sinking, and it also implies that the power of the capitalists is impossible to deal with! The original "Man Jiang Hong" could only be supplied for entertainment, and there was no possibility of adapting it into a screenplay. Here we can understand how difficult it is to adapt a screenplay, especially when you want to change an old subject matter and give it a new consciousness. It is unrewarding and easy to make mistakes. I wonder if Mr. Wang also feels sympathy for this?</p>
<h3>Talking About "Flying Catkins"</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Qun</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Strictly speaking: the biggest regret in the performance of "Flying Catkins" is because it is restricted by the script and lacks dramatic "force". After watching this film, the impression is like reading a poem. Fortunately, the director worked very hard here and arranged such a story very meticulously. Moreover, the performance skills of each part also show the director's experience and familiarity from time to time. However, the entire plot is loose, and I always feel that it cannot tightly grasp the heartstrings of the audience. Instead, the subtitles gave a lot of help to the whole drama. There are several joints where the dramatic power is insufficient, and all of them rely on powerful explanations to weave and arrange them. So, in terms of the formation of the whole film, it is not too annoying.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Yuan Meiyun is still the most successful one. The innocence and activity of the cattle-herding period; the abuse suffered during the servant period and the adoptive daughter-in-law period, and the cruelty given by the world, each performance is deeply moving and can arouse the sympathy of the audience. Wang Huijuan plays a gentle and incompetent woman, and her performance has improved compared to "Little Actress". Bao Zhichao's acting is too stiff. The rest, such as Tian Fang, Wu Yixiao, Chen Qixia, and Cang Yinqiu, are all mediocre. The scenery is still realistic, and the lighting in some places in the photography is too dark, but there is no major problem. To sum up in one sentence: the performance of "Flying Catkins" seems to lack dramatic (ness), but because (work) has considerable success, it is (worth seeing).</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Trinkets (7)</h3>
<p>— Cong Mei</p>
<p>Yuan Pu stood up to say goodbye. Auntie Ye helped him straighten his tie and took him to the door. He said, "I might not see you again for seven or eight years. The last thing I want to say is... because I am a person, I should fulfill my obligations to the country... But, at the same time, because I have a heart, I will always love you!"</p>
<p>Auntie Ye stood still in a daze, smiling, but tears were surging in her eyes. Yuan Pu was gone; he had left bravely. She leaned against the door, tears streaming down her face, all alone, even more desolate!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Auntie Ye was stimulated. She retreated into the house, her steps light and weak, her spirit drooping. As she sat down, the bitter tears in her eyes rolled out like pearls. "Why does everyone have to have a heart?" she asked miserably, pointing to her own heart.</p>
<p>Zhu'er came in and saw her mother crying, so she threw herself into her arms and told her not to cry. "Mom!... Only silly people cry!" Zhu'er used her little finger to catch her mother's tears and flicked them towards the mud monk, and then they both laughed.</p>
<p>◆◆◆◆</p>
<p>In the vast darkness of night, a train was traveling in the distance. Yuan Pu was rushing from the darkness to his bright future! At this time, in a dilapidated house where the last lamp had not yet been extinguished, there was silence. Old Ye was snoring like a dead pig. Yu'er was smiling in her sleep. Zhu'er clung tightly to her mother's embrace. As for Auntie Ye? She had her eyes wide open, unable to sleep in the middle of the night. She stared at the ceiling in a daze, as if she heard the sound of the rumbling wheels; as if she saw Yuan Pu's shadow. Her heart was disturbed. She could only secretly shed tears in the silent air!</p>
<p>Spring came again, another year. At that moment of dawn, the lake and mountains were still so beautiful. But the warm spring breeze could not reach the home of Old Ye, who was becoming increasingly impoverished. Everything had changed! Old Ye was wearing ragged clothes, and he was also sick, coughing and panting, looking even more pitiful!</p>
<p>"Zhu'er's father! Was that you coughing just now?... Auntie Ye asked when she heard the coughing, concerned that his illness had flared up again.</p>
<p>"No!... I've been much better lately!" he said, putting on a smile. Auntie Ye was drowsy; but her soul was being invaded by grief! (To be continued)</p>
