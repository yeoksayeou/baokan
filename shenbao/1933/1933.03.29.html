<p>國聨將以更迅速有效方法處理中日問題</p>
<p>彼黷武横行之侵略者必受其應得之果報</p>
<p>（南京）　外交部羅部長今日發表關於日本宣告退出國聨宣言、云日本政府不顧國際條約之尊嚴、國際聨合會之决議、實行以武力佔據東三省、進攻上海、並侵入熱河、今復更進一步正式宣告退出以促進國際合作確保國際和平與安全爲職志之國際組織、當茲國聨積極努力解决中日問題之時、日本政府採取此項步驟、不啻故意設法損害大戰後維持世界和平之組織、且無異明白宣言拒絶以和平方法解决此極重大之國際爭執、並强迫中國接受日本欲提出之任何條件、日本政府所陳述之脫離國聨之理由、現無再行申辨之必要、良以此種謬論、屢經中國政府及國聨之迭次决議與大會報告書予以澈底之駁訴也、惟有必須指明者、即日本退出國聨之宣告、并未免除其實際脫離國聨前所必須履行之種種義務查國聨盟約第一條第二項明白規定、凡聨合會會員經兩年前預先通告後得退出聨合會、但須於退出之時將其所有國際義務及爲本盟約所負之一切義務履行完竣、今試將此項規定適用於日本之宣告退出、其意義顯謂自國聨受理中日爭議以來、所有行政院及大會所通過之决議案、對於日本均有仍效、並在日本之退出、能視爲法律上之事實以前所有國聨方面關於此案所可採用通過之一切决定或决議、亦將對於日本同等有效、不僅如是、凡各項國際條約、經國聨宣告爲解决本爭議之原則者、其規定之義務、在日本尙未完全履行之、則日本亦不能享有退出之權利、簡言之、即日本如欲享有退出國聨之權利、更須在通告退出後之兩年、期間内、實行非戰公約九國條約及國聨盟約所規定之一切義務、否則日本將仍爲國聨之一員、且將與其他之國聨會員國、同等受國聨之管轄、以此種種、中日爭議在國際聨盟下之公允處置、毫不因日本現所採取之步驟、而受有任何不良之影響、自他方面言之、日本宣告退出國聨、不僅不足以損及國聨之威信、如日本私心所希冀者且適足以促使國聨、以更迅速有效之方法、處理中日問題、蓋日本出席國聨之代表、曾一再以退出國聨相恫嚇、而國聨毅然不顧、以一致之决議、通過大會報告書、足見其欲以國聨之原則、解愴　日問題、早具决心、唯其如是、故彼一意孤行、屢違國聨盟約及國聨决議之日本、一旦宣告脫離、反足减少國聨執行其艱鉅任務時之牽制、中國政府深信國聨地位、必將益形鞏固、且將採取緊急有效之方法、以應付日本宣告退出國聨後之新局勢、日本宣告退出國聨之後、勢將招致全世界一致之反對、蓋世界各國、固均熱烈擁護國聨盟約及和平正義者也、中國政府深信國聨所代表之原則、終必戰勝、中日問題終必得公平之解决、而彼黷武横行之侵略者、終必受其應得之果報也、（二十八日專電）</p>
<p>日本脫離國聨後</p>
<h3 id="c1">國聨與各國反響 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>國聨顧問委員會昨開會</p>
<p>日本理事遺席引起逐鹿</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　日本退出國聨會之通告、已於本日下午三時十分電達國聨秘書長德魯蒙、秘書廳當即答復日本外相、並立將日本來電連同國聨會復文、抄送國聨會各會員國、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日本之退出國聨、須俟兩年後始有效力、但數國總揆現已有俟日本退出行政院永遠理事席後、即改組行政院之意、小國對於行政院之操縱、尤其是處理中日爭議事及軍縮會議、現漸有怨言、近來此種不祥之聲浪、頗有煽成公然叛變之勢、故政治觀察家對於改造行政院或改變選舉制度之運動、並不視爲怪事、今日晚旗報預料國聨將發生内部風潮、與一九二六年德國加入國聨以前相同、該報以爲三小協約國久巳自命爲大國、終必提出代有日本遺席之要求、而法國與波蘭及若干小國必爲其後援、但意德及他國之反對法國派者、亦必同樣抵抗之、是以國聨行政院不久或將成全歐互相抵觸的恐慌與野心之焦點云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　大國與若干小國之代表、對於在目前情勢下召集二十一人顧問委員會會議、是否有益一層、彼此意見稍有差異、在大國觀之、該委員會對於日本退出國聨事、可否發何議論、而美代表之出席此次會議、得無使此點之討論越出權力範圍之外、此皆爲甚可疑問之點、但顧問委員會主席藍格則决定在各代表因耶蘇復活節假期出外以前、宜照前例有所舉動、故定今日午後五時半開會、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c2">代管島問題 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>（倫敦）　今日下院中保守黨議員包士特詢問、若有一國聨會員國退出國聨後、其所受理之委任統治地、應如何辦法、外次艾登答稱、英政府正在考慮此問題、但因各大國尙未討論此事、故英國政府現時不能有所表示云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　國務院以爲日本退出國聨會一舉、早在意料之中、美國對日本及對國聨會所採政策、决不因此變更、美國政府志在維護世界和平、對國聨會仍將密切合作、而以獨立精神解决遠東問題、美國代表當一本三月十三日國務院致國聨會覆文所云、參加國聨會爲注視遠東問題而組織之顧問委員會、美國當局對於太平洋中日本代管島嶼問題、極端關心、尤以海軍界爲甚、因日本一旦與美國發生衝突、此項海島在戰略上地位極關重要也、美國報紙迭次斥責日本、謂其在加羅林納羣島設置防禦工事、本年一月間國務院遠東司司長曾謂委任統治制度係由歐戰而來、美國雖非國聨會會員國、然爲參戰份子、對於有關委任統治地方之一切見解及决定、美國仍有參加之權利云云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　頃日本報紙載、日本與德國雙方政府、對於日本退出國聨之後、仍繼續保持太平洋上舊德屬殖民地統治權事件、已於本月四日開始磋商一節、柏林政府當局今日聲明並無其事、故日本方面宣傳之德國種種意見、及與此問題有關之一切行動、俱屬無稽之造作、再則德國對於此問題之見解、仍如數日前之所宣佈者、毫無變更云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　日本各報所載關於加羅林羣島統治權之消息、謂係國家社會黨議員羅森培向日訪員所述、茲據國社黨機關報載稱羅森培並未接見任何日本訪員云、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>每日電聞稱、國聨因遠東最强國之脫會、將愈覺肢體不完、以法理言、日本已破壞國聨規程矣、日内瓦對於日本脫會、現漸有種種建議惟、經濟抵制、及軍火禁運、或南洋島嶼代管權收回之空談、無補於事、徒增無謂之仇恨而已、俟此問題正式提出時、國聨再討論之、未爲晚也云、</p>

<h3 id="c81">日退出國聨後之影響 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>二年内仍須履行一切義務</p>
<p>英美德爲統治島將起衝突</p>
<p>中央社云、日本業於前日正式通告退出國際聨盟會、中央社記者今晨特往訪外交家伍朝樞氏、詢以日本通告退出國聨後、國際間將發生何種影響、當承延見、詳爲答復如下、</p>
<p>瘋狂心理之表現　據伍氏談、日本雖於前日通告退出國聨、但依國聨盟約、須至一九三五年三月二十七日、始能實行退出、在此兩年之中、日本仍須履行一切國聨會員國之義務、此如上海之租屋、須在一月之前通告退租、通告一月之後、始可實行退租、日本因國聨主持公道、憤而退出、欲使國聨受細微之打擊、然在此兩年之内、日本仍須受國際盟約之拘束、履行其會員國之義務、是故日本之退出國聨、實有害無利、但日本明知有害無利、而仍通告退出、以洩一時之憤、於此亦可見日人瘋狂心理之一斑矣、至於日本退出國聨之後、其首先發生之影響、厥爲增强世界不直日本之輿論、其次則爲因委任統治島而起之衝突、</p>
<p>英美德日之衝突　日本通告退出國聨、但仍欲保留南洋委任統治諸島、勢必與國聨發生衝突、且日本若欲保留南洋委任統治諸島、英美德三國、均有與日本發生直接衝突之可能、蓋英屬之澳洲、隣接南洋委任統治諸島、英國固不願野心勃勃之日本、統治南洋諸島也、美國因軍事及商業上之種種關係、亦將强硬反對日本保留南洋委任統治諸島、德國乃南洋諸島昔日之主人、此時必將聲請歸還、取消日本这代管權、是故南洋委任統治島問題、非特將引起日本與國聨間之衝突、且英美德三國、均有與日本發生直接衝突之可能、此有關全世界之軒然大波、將因此而掀動矣、</p>
<p>蔣公使暫不返任　關於東北問題、目前中日絶無直兿交涉之可能、至於國聨能否制裁日本、仍須視英美法諸國有無此决心爲斷、目前中日兩國之外交重心、在日内瓦、軍事重心、在長城一帶、駐日公使實有無事可辦之感、是故蔣公使决定目前暫不返任云、</p>

<p>據王德林司令之駐滬代表梁德堂談、敝部眷屬等來滬後、蒙各界團體加惠食宿之所、並殷勤招待、代付膳宿費用、照拂之周至、自令人銘感無似、惟余等以爲、每日支付滬海旅社膳宿費在百元左右、殊非久計、且嗣後東北抗日各軍、如馬占山·蘇炳文·李杜·馮占海、等各部、不免有以屏絶後顧之憂起見、或將繼續遣眷屬來滬、故爲謀一勞永逸起見、似應覓一較爲寬敞之地點、俾各抗日將士之眷屬得所安身、則各抗日將士無家室之累、更得專心努力爲國殺敵、本日赴各機關團體拜謝時、曾以此意向各界陳述、</p>

<p>丨丨蘇州屈藻琪君來信丨丨</p>
<p>主筆先生：我是一個年已及冠　靑年。每次閱讀貴報時，輒先以讀者顧問竟讀之爲快。得見先生之高見，與靑年以正當之途徑。今以個人所遭遇情事，實告先生，希先生與以完美的答覆。我在十五歲時，小學方纔畢業的時　，多事的父母，替我比我大三歲的一個素不相識的女子結婚了。可憐我那時根本不知道婚姻爲何物，釀成了今日的大錯！結婚後，因我的家境尙過得去，仍繼續我的求學；不到半載，家父因病逝世，此時我方十六歲，一切家政，操之母手。但家母素性游閒，一旦推政，儘量消耗，始則出入於賭博塲中，旣而吞雲吐霧，終日與　君子爲伴。加以家父棄養後　　父爭産，發生訟事，於是家庭陷於破産，家父遺産，迄今殆無。我雖勉强掙扎要求繼續求學，今雖人省立某職業學校，離開畢業時期，尙有二年餘。在此數年中預備得到　獨　生活的技能，脫離此黑暗的家庭，無奈墮落的家母，一己消耗，尙覺不足，在一年前，又姘識了一同志，共同過那非人的生活。雖經我數次的勸戒，仍置若無聞。知己無望，乃轉注重於妻，祈望與以種種安慰，互相勸勉，奮力前程。奈禍不單行，家母旣已墮落，妻子又步後塵。此次寒假回里，身染淋病，致我體軀，更形孱弱。依醫理斷定，足證她（指妻）已負我。她雖是一個目不識丁的村女，兩人程度懸殊，然同我已有五六年的歷史，有了相當的友情，且已生育了一子一女。我也没有什麽奢求，但很希望她能做我一個終身的良伴。現在她又這樣，有什麽方法可對付呢？我因精神與肉體　覺痛苦了些，學業身體各方面，不免受了相當的影響。先生見聞已多，我的家庭狀况，孰有甚於此者乎？今我抱定宗旨，唯有努力學業，俾可儘量供獻社會，置一切於不顧。惟在此數年中，能否繼續求學？畢業後有無正當的出路？却是重要問題。今我以家庭黑幕赤裸裸地公布出來，希望先生有無别的良法，與我以詳細的答覆！</p>
<p>答：家庭到了如此地步。只有斬金截鐵地與　一刀兩斷，即使因此廢學，到外邊做個流浪人（這自然不是好辦法，能做工最好），也比在那種爛汚的家庭中討知活好。至於足下的夫人，你如有法而且願意與之賡續舊好，自然是好，然而這未一來，你仍然是跳不出舊家庭的圈子丨這可就難了！最後我還有一句話勸告你，你旣然得了淋症，要儘可能地減少性交，少吃刺激性的東西，趕緊醫治，打針更好，不然，這個毛病眞比什麽都要慘酷！</p>

<p>中葡實力比較　兩國間之實力、至爲强勁、中華隊擁有西聨甲組錦標之東華及優游曁南三隊、良將如雲、英材濟濟、葡萄牙曾於一九二九年奪得上海萬國足球錦標、其威名夙著、稍識海上足球歷史者、殆無不知之、近兩年來似有消失衰落氣象、惟健將依舊散布於西聨各强隊中、如法商會、戰力强勁、成績卓著、考其球員大半屬於葡萄牙籍、如馬賽爾、如雷米狄、如法凡却等等、均一時名將、一旦中葡興兵、勝負難卜、其盛况可以預期焉、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c174">說抵抗能力達伍 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>談到抗日救國，最好的方法自然是「長期抵抗」。而長期抵抗，却也並非易易止囝不但要有抵抗的决心，并且要還有抵抗的能力」。「决心」當然我們者早已經有了：中央旣曾三番四次地表示「已有决心」，而將領們函電之中，也無不義憤塡膺的說，「爲國而死，雖死猶生」，顯見「决心」我們是早已有了，如今所缺的只是「抵抗的能力」。</p>
<p>「救國不以其道，奮鬭不得其方」，大家只知盲目救國，浮囂奮鬭，那「抵抗的結果」，是「無傷於敵人的毫末」的。所以抵抗必先要有抵抗能力，否則，「一樣的會亡國」，倒不如不抵抗主義爲上。</p>
<p>什麽是「抵抗能力」呢？曰：</p>
<p>第一，是「曾受國民敎育，有國民革命軍的精神的」。「我們儘見物質不如别人而精神過之者得到勝利一。（達按：如阿Ａ之流）。</p>
<p>第二，是「充實國民的生産能力，（達按：如種××等等）然後再想種種方法（方法詳後）使國民的生産能力能應用如武力」。（達按：如××公賣等等）。</p>
<p>第一項是「精神敎育」，最利於長期抵抗，「十年敎訓」，即此之謂。任何人一看便可了然。第二項不但是軍事問題，并且還牽涉到政治社會等等問題，似乎比較難以瞭解。前旣已明說充實國民生産能力：而物質不如精神，亦已爲定律，那末，這裏所要生産的大槪而且當然是「精神生産」了，精神生産是什麽？自仍不外乎長期抵抗的「决心」，與死後得上昇天堂的「信心」。至於所謂種種方法，則又要不外於發行救國公債，抽收救國捐，由民間發起航空救國運動，等等，等等。</p>
<p>救國公債云者，是由政府發行，救國捐云者，各省不妨分途而進，至於航空救國，是額外輸將，不論貧富，自然都有「出錢」的義務。如此則抵抗的决心有了，抵抗的能力也有了，今而後庶幾無亡國之憂。至於「體力亦弱，血壓仍高」，那并不在乎；因爲精神終於是勝過物質。</p>
<h3 id="c175">江堤上李輝英 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>一個人，悄悄地走到江堤上，茫然站住了。</p>
<p>算一算罷，啊，我離别這裏，一幌就有十三個多月了。久别重逢，我眞不知有多少說不出的高興！尤其是，暖洋洋的春天的太陽，晒的人懶懶的，還不時有微風，從海面上，從田野中陣陣吹來，簡直使人沉醉。</p>
<p>我放開那雙被都市足足束縛了十三個月的眼睛，照着十三個月以前的慣例，先看對面的江邊。没有什麽變更呵，對面的江邊！依然有綠樹，依然有碧野，依然在江邊伏現着一抹的沙灘，而且依然存留着一般人以爲有失雅觀的茅棚和茅棚裏不斷冒出來的炊烟，後面遠處地方，依然襯出一片籃天。</p>
<p>再往海面上一望，也正如往日一般，一大片白亮亮，黑亮亮的水，天連水，水連天，緊緊的接連着，帆船，輪船，皇后號，往來不斷，連掠水飛翔的海鳥，也還顯露着昔日甜美的微笑。</p>
<p>經過十三個月的别離，我四年常游的江堤，並没有什麽不同呵。</p>
<p>眞的没有什麽不同嗎？不，到底是有些不同的。我一看到脚下江堤的大缺口，就想起確實不同了，這毫無疑義地，是受到了日本帝國主義的砲火的轟炸。这百一個巨大的創痕，可是，十三個月過後的今天，這創口上居然生出了靑靑的小草，也許，再過些時，創口會完全變樣，引不起任何人的注意。不過，我是無論如何也不能忘記！</p>
<p>再轉身看看身後一帶地方，不同的地方可就多了：遠處，吳淞鎭呈現着一片瓦礫，大學堂的紅磚樓房還留着炸燬後的牆壁，無線電台只剩了一隻鐵桿；近處，破敗了的車站，焚燬凈了的茅屋！丨而今只剩一片平地，那失蹤的海濱旅館和精緻的小洋房，還有，那很多舊日相熟的面孔，學生，鄉人們，頑皮孩子們，站員，警丁，甚至於幾只認識的村犬都没有了，見不到了，這怎能說同往日是一樣的呢？</p>
<p>這一切不都是受了「一二八」的恩賜嗎？十三個月以前，這地方不正是每天在演着日本帝國主義侵略的戰爭麽？飛機，炸彈，大砲，機關槍，飛着，響着，炸着，就把這江濱一帶地方，房舍呀，人畜呀，都弄光了。</p>
<p>但這究竟還是可以用眼睛看得到的殘跡，至於那些爲民族爭生存的反帝的武士們，他們犧牲了的生命，他們流出來的赤血，現在不是一點痕跡也尋不到了嗎？又有誰，會想到這些事情呢，不是連一幅斷壁頽垣的畫迹都没有留存下來麽？</p>
<p>「没有關係呀」我就這麽想了，「他們當兵的人，遲早是免不了一死的，而且他們又是死於反帝戰爭，不是很光榮的麽？還有」，我又一轉念，「不是由於他們的能夠不怕死，才給我們大中華民國造出了幾具民族英雄麽丨以中國這次殖民地的國家竟然會添出幾個民族英雄，那不是什麽事情都好辦了麽，不是在國際上也增光了麽！」</p>
<p>唉，我眞不知這些死去的武士們，他們的靈魂（如其眞有靈魂的話）流落到什麽地方去了，也許，他們在呌寃罷，後悔這次的死亡罷，……</p>
<p>算了，不要再看了，也不要再想了，一個人，悄悄的走下江堤，走向歸途。這時在我的心裏，眞伏有說不出的一種創痛。</p>
<h3 id="c176">道素王婉容 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>道素死了，從此貞節庵中再也聽不到夜鶯的低唱，嗅不到白蓮花的芳香了！</p>
<p>我認識道素，是四年前的暮春時分。</p>
<p>貞節庵在琴山之麓，雖然已是暮春，但那裏還没有呢喃的鳥語，馥郁的花香；只有明亮的，珠簾似的瀑布從琴山上墜雲奔絮地向下直淌，淌落地後，恰巧在庵前流過，庵的兩側，有參天的古木，古木中間的一座墳墓裏躺着一個已故的老尼姑。我們站在貞節庵的大殿上，便能聽見潺涓的泉韻和澎湃的松濤。所以庵裏的尼姑們是並不十分寂寞的，這兒並不和其他的尼庵一樣陰沉沉的像一座古墓。</p>
<p>道素是一個清瘦的小尼姑，没有人知道她的身世，也没有人知道她是幾時出家的。她善於闔着眼，聳起眉尖長嘆。那潔白的顔面，那嬌弱的身軀，令人一見便聨想到清水中的白蓮花：而當她盤膝坐在神像前，從黑的寬大的袈裟中伸出手來輕輕地敲着木魚，曼聲誦經的時候，那閒靜的態度，那清脆的聲音，又令人聨想到一隻月下的夜鶯的低唱。誰說貞節庵寂寞呢？那裏有潺涓的泉韻，有澎湃的松濤。誰說貞節庵中永遠是冬天呢？冬天那來一聲聲的夜鶯的低唱，一陣陣的白蓮花的幽香？</p>
<p>如今兩年，潺涓的泉韻還在，澎湃的松濤依然，只是再也聽不到那夜鶯的低唱，嗅不到那白蓮花的幽香了！</p>
<p>道素！如果你也有靈魂在另一個世界存在的話，我但願那裏也有松濤，溪流，清風，明月，你仍舊可以在飛裏像夜鶯一樣歌唱，像白蓮花一樣搖曳！</p>
<h3 id="c177">處世哲學楊柳岸 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>研究哲學的人，幾乎常是被人說是瘋子的，因爲這些都與柴米油鹽無關。但是，「處世哲學」却非　不可！</p>
<p>有些博士學者之流，起初倒眞的獃頭獃腦去研究甚麽「大綱」，甚麽「史」，但懂得「處世哲學」之後，隨即就會把這些撈什子抛開了。爲的是這類東西祇好供人如厠，和「處世哲學」第一章「升官發財ＡＢＣ」上所載不大切合。升官發財，中在終南捷徑在。</p>
<p>捷徑爲何？無他·「拍馬」「吹牛」而已。「拍」「吹」人人會做，可是巧妙各有不同。例如：國聨調查團報告書，爲洋大人之所寫，爲土政府之所喜，便須得拿出「獨立」的精神，連聲說：「好極好極！正義所歸，公理斯張丨」這是正面的拍法。（擇洋馬而拍，手段更屬高强，）又例如：有些人要爭取民權保障，而你是要討好政府的，於是便說「民權繫於法律，憲法成功，民權自可保障，你們不能站在政治上着想，須得站在法律上要求。（政府不是明明在起草憲法了嗎！！但此句不可明言）」這是仚頉的拍法。</p>
<p>至於「吹牛，」例如：你可以隨便說那一本舊小說好。在那小說上做一篇序，說得天花亂墜，於是「好奇」的人便會墜入你的彀中，於是你便可以從書買的手縫裏討得一注筆潤。又例如：你把自己「吹」成世界學者，一等名流，便有人請你去演講，於是你又亂吹一陣，每次便可得着大洋五千元的「旅費」。</p>
<p>這不過是隨便舉兩個例而已，實際上還有許多方法的。伹總而言之，「拍馬」「吹牛」均須具備一種條件，便是老着臉皮。而且你還要能「忍」，譬如給你一個敎育部長之類，你最好還是不要幹，因爲更有比那個好的，你不妨等着。</p>
<p>有此諸般法，「處世哲學」之能事畢矣，率成一「偈」曰：</p>
<p>處世哲學，名利是求。求名求利，拍馬吹牛。臉兒要厚，心兒要柔。「獨立」「吹」「拍」，逈異凡儔。如是我觀：適哉，適哉，胡爲乎而不適哉！</p>

<p>「你支那裏去來？怎麽不守時刻？」</p>
<p>唐耀星一接着他，便半笑半惱地　長他的嘴唇向他質問。</p>
<p>「看電影去了的。」</p>
<p>海泉一面笑着回答，一面看見還有兩個他所不認識的靑年坐在唐耀星的房裏。</p>
<p>「你眞是小布　喬亞，有閒階級！」</p>
<p>耀星笑着駡他。但海泉只是笑。踏進了房裏，他便向坐在那兒的兩個靑年請敎姓名。</p>
<p>「我來介紹一下。…」</p>
<p>唐耀星未說先笑了。</p>
<p>「……這位鄭家騏君，是浙江的封建遺孽·這位柳松新君，是山西土豪。…這位是…是廣東的買辦階級，小白臉，林海泉君。…」</p>
<p>「瞎說！我怎麽是買辦階級呢？」</p>
<p>於是四個人都大笑起來了。</p>
<p>「今晚上有好消息喲。……快走，我們呌一輛汽車坐着去快一點。」</p>
<p>「有什麽好消息？」</p>
<p>「到那邊去了後，陳先生會給我們報告的。」</p>
<p>他們都不做聲了，一同走出來。唐耀星到一家汽車行裏呌汽車行裏呌汽車去了。他們三個只是立在弄堂口等他。</p>
<p>「到什麽地方去？」</p>
<p>海泉問他倆。</p>
<p>「我也不知道。」</p>
<p>鄭家騏笑着回答。</p>
<p>「聽說是到一家外國酒店裏去。」</p>
<p>過後，便沉寂下去了。不一刻，唐耀星坐着的汽車駛前來了。他們三個都上了車。</p>
<p>「到什麽地方？」</p>
<p>聽見車夫在問耀星。耀星聲音很低小的回答了車夫。海泉聽不清楚他是說到什麽地方去。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>望重全球　的意相墨索里尼，爲着瑞士國兒童寫信來詰責：丨爲什麽匯欵向意國某廠購買的手琴至今信息杳然？墨氏不惜自降身分寫一封親筆道歉書，聲明：丨該廠業已破産，致勞小友盼望；今特由本人寄奉手琴一具，請小友諒其　遲云云。瑞士國小友倒會淘氣，買不到手琴，不向廠主浆涉，而詰問起總攬全國的首相來。若照東方的官塲習氣而論，早已置諸不理；不然，批一句：毋庸煩凟。再不然，批一句：着該童等自向廠家交涉。以下不是此批，定是此諭，不是寫上粉牌，定是實貼照牆，若要敎他向小朋友在書面道罪，這便是鼻子上掛　魚，休想休想休休想。</p>
<p>氏肯向小友道歉，畢竟是一位「休休有容」的首相，但，在墨氏自已做小朋友時期，也是慣會淘氣的孩子。他幼時身軀矮小，兩目中飽含英銳之氣；在十二三齡奉了父命上省城的時候，有小同學侮辱了他，他拔出小袋刀來刺傷他第一個敵人。墨氏幼年時對付小朋友這般的嚴厲，做了首相時對付小朋友又是那般謙和；這是一個很可討論的問麗。</p>
<p>在一九一九年意國選舉塲中社會黨抬頭，墨氏領導的法西斯蒂歸於失敗；社會黨凱　過市，在那旗幛飛揚之下高呼着：「該死的墨索里尼」。坐在民衆日報館中的墨氏，指着案頭手槍向編輯員說：「他們旗幛下的不是一輩盲目暴徒麽？若到這裏來，我必擊殺此獠，只怕他們没有這勇氣吧。」墨氏在失意中不肯示弱於社會黨的呐喊，墨氏在得意中卻肯服罪於小朋友的責言；這又是一個很可討論的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c205">戚將軍練膽的精義 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>前天偶然翻閱戚繼光「練兵實紀」一書，中有「一練兵法，二練膽氣，三練耳目，四練手足，五練營陣，六練將，」這六個練法，照現在的敵人兵强器銳，當然是不合了。但說「練膽」，吾以爲古今一樣，值得提出來，供那手握兵符領導抗日之主帥采擇，也是一篇狠好的條陳。</p>
<p>什麽要「練膽」，從前的軍備，只有弓矢干戈劍戟斧鉅幾種，到了現在，槍砲以外，全用飛機來轟射，當那軋軋的聲響臨頭，站在陣綫上的士兵們，碰見了飛彈如雨，烈燄如雲般來侵襲，頃刻間，雖躱在深溝高壘中，也立成爲一片炸墟。試問擋頭陣的生死，不是在一刹那兒就可以分明麽？所以這個時候，還要他去拚命的衝鋒，像一毅然不懼，履險如夷」，不至於「不寒而慄，不戰而潰」，如何幹得到，者番湯玉麟的棄城而逃，就是一個最切近的例證。别人說他是得賄賣國，以致喪師失地，其實憑藉孤城，雖有天然的險要，他也没有「膽力」可扼守。聽得他的軍隊，最後逃亡的，還被敵兵擊斃，槍珠都從背後穿入，豈不是卑怯退縮的證據麽？</p>
<p>故我說戚繼光的「練兵實紀」，確是一部有價值的兵書，不過練兵，當然一練膽」爲第一要着，再進一步請，兵的膽已壯，而將的膽未經練就，仍然没用，什麽緣故，統兵的大將，要到前線去指揮，倘和敵人交綏的當兒，一聽槍砲之聲，烈於雷霆，就掩耳而逃，就算挺進，看見砲火所及，已成了一條血路，也必返身以避，恐神色一變，舉止不免倉皇，到這地步，將帥這樣，士卒尙能拚死，同那敵人决個雌雄麽？是練兵要「練膽」，練將也要「練膽」，當明朝時戚繼光的能抗日本，不敢入犯我中原，稱戚家軍與岳家軍先後輝映，就在這一點，我望現在主持軍政的，也採取此精義以振那頽靡的士氣。</p>

<p>— 火明</p>
<p>歐陽懈詠燕詩，有兩句道：「長向春秋社前後，爲誰歸去爲誰來。」現在春風晴暖，碧郊花放，已是寒食季節，燕子從暖地啓程，飛到江南來的時候了。</p>
<p>我們一年相見一度，雖然聽不懂它們呢喃着的是什麽意思，但總覺得這聲音習熟得很，美麗得很。幼年住在東海灘頭的小邨落裏，一所瓦屋的樑上排列着三五個燕巢，從秋風起，燕子回到南方去，我就覺得寂寞，直要在江南的桃花將放，菜花開滿田畦的仲春，它們才照例成羣的飛來，和我們住在一起。每天早晨，它們高興地鼓噪，打醒了我底夢，馬上起身，站在太陽光裏看它們飛，聽它們細語。中午臨着河濱，又鑑賞它們在藍的波影裏梭一般的忙，兩片春花落在它們黑色的剪翼上，只要翻一個雪卵似的肚皮，像魔術那樣；落花飛開，它們又掠着水波穿進楊柳裏去了。晚間瞧老了的燕子，帶着東西回來，曾經寫過一首小詩：</p>
<p>「屋簷　　自盤桓，飛近巢時又折回。誘得衆雛各探首，遙瞻覓食母歸來。」這村居的情調，現在是不可復得了的。我好像坐在這上海的廢城裏，不見桃花，不見燕子。</p>
<p>然而市塲上的燕　，已從故鄉的農　上販賣來上海　了。我淡淡地掀動着懷鄉的愁思，我更憐惜着自己靑春的死滅。丨燕！正和你一樣匆忙地在生活的漩渦裏飛來飛去·也一樣消磨了夢一般的希望，然而有什麽意義呢？和你一樣已没有了家呀！</p>

<p>於是毫不考慮的，一直就向楊家走來。走到外面屋子裏，先笑着呌了一聲老太太。他每次來都是這樣子呌的。這一聲老太太，不算是恭敬之辭，只是個老姑娘打一個電報，告訴他我來了而已。在每回如此招呼之後，桂枝必定不聲不響的走了出來，點頭一笑。不說歡迎，那歡迎的盛意，自然是充分表示出來無遺。可是今天在這一聲老太太呌過这後，情形爲之大變，那屋子裏面，很嚴厲的有人問了一個字，誰？這個誰字，是桂枝喊出來的，以自己和桂枝感情如此之好，桂枝會不識自己的聲音嗎？而且這一個誰字，問得非常之重，决不是平常問話的情形。這倒有些奇怪，爲什麽如此？這是自相知以來從未曾有的表示呀！正這樣疑惑着，裏面江氏，就揷嘴道：是甘二爺嗎？請進來罷。積之答應着，走了進去，只見老姑娘低了頭坐在坑上，眼圈兒紅紅的，江氏起身迎着他笑道；二爺，我們丫頭什麽事得罪了府上的人嗎？積之一聽這話，便知道出了什麽事體，臉上也就跟着一紅，却故意鎭靜着，裝了不知道的情形，問道：這話從何而起？江氏道：今天…………桂枝裝着臉，連連扯了他母親的衣服幾下，撅了嘴道：你多什麽事，别說了，别說了！江氏道　二爺也没有得罪了你，幹嗎不說呢？就是二爺得罪了你，咱們也得把這話問個靑紅皂白。桂枝聽到母親如此解釋着，才低了頭不作聲。江氏笑道；二爺也别多心，我們這窮人，又是孤兒寡婦，還敢和人論個什麽長短嗎？可是我們得分辨一聲，我們窮是窮，可是個清白人家，雖然和府上做些衣服過活，這也是本分事情，府上若說我娘兒倆作得不好，以後不讓我們作也就完了。可是我們並没有幹什麽爲非作歹的事情，今天我這丫頭到府上去，打算問一問太太，二爺這件衣服，作得合身不合身，這也是他巴結過分了。（二六）</p>

<h3 id="c210">莘墅往返小小紀 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 柯定</p>
<p>（上）</p>
<p>莘墅，是新市的别署，還有一個名兒呌做：「仙潭」。在新市鎭誌上，關於神話式的傳說，有着不少的紀載。現在題不及此，暫且不談。新市是浙江省屬德清縣治下的第一大鎭，風土人物，都有極好的模楷。有清一代的名畫家沈銓氏南蘋，也是新市人呢！</p>
<p>我到新市的時候，是在三歲那年，所以新市，也就是我的第二故鄉，和我關係是很密切的。我對於新市所不能忘懷的，是南柵外果山丨丨俗名假山丨丨的獅子峰，美人石，桃源　。以及鎭的中心點覺海寺的二大金剛。丨詳見下說。</p>
<p>果山的獅子峰，是一個石頭生成的獅子形，昂首向東，張口努目，在早晨去看它，好似要把那鮮紅的大日一口吞下去·它的姿勢是雄偉的，它的精神是振作的，但是一般漠然無關的有閒階級，當然不會去想到這些。美人石，也差不多在那裏，風度婉然，彷彿有西子姗姗而來之狀。桃源洞，稍微還要過去幾步，是一個八尺來寬的石洞，上面有平鋪的石板，四周有柔軟的綠茵。不過傳說下面有鬼，所以下去冒險的人，究竟到現在還没有過。覺海寺的二大金剛，是出於新市附近某醫李某之手。他也是高興，和江西名匠丨江西有著名的雕塑家，當時新市造覺海寺的時候，去請了幾位來雕塑四大金剛丨開玩笑。雕塑的時候，雙方各守秘密，圍着密密的竹籬，不使任何人看見。到了大功造成之日，拆開竹籬，大家鑒賞，那裏知道平日新市人崇拜的江西名手，竟大坍其台；而不出名的李某，倒受着大衆讚美。原來他所雕塑的，精神飽滿，栩栩如生；那江西人雕塑的，却平淡無奇，靡靡欲睡。所以這幾件物事，很能佔據在我的腦海裏。</p>
<p>（下）</p>
<p>第二故鄉，在費了三元不到的代價，已呈現在我眼前，高高的步雲橋，依然無恙。但是其他的一切，是顯露了非常的悲像。去年的農民們，都是五榖豐登，他們的心花是如何的開放，家庭是如何的愉快。那裏知道各處都是五轂豐登，大家都賣不起價錢。所以造成了一個新名詞；「賤榖傷農」。新市也就是爲了；「賤榖傷農」而感受到市况蕭條。平日鎭上人咒詛鄉下人，現在却要咒詛也無所由了。據說：</p>
<p>「南貨店二家，綢緞局二家，點心店一家，茶樓一家………都宣告停止營業了！」</p>
<p>假如你在街上走，會感到和「死市」差不多，然而我深深地知道，這是一個普遍的現象，不單獨是新市。</p>
<p>果山前的獅子峯，依然昂頭吞日，美人石不减態度苗條，桃源洞還是老樣；不過那覺海寺的二大金剛，多了些剝蝕的痕跡，好似我國東北的鱗傷。</p>
<p>新市人愛國不肯後人，在日内將有：「航空救國」的演劇籌欵。聽說要過了古歴三月初頭的例戲，纔能正式實行。「航空救國」是一個救國的最高方法，想來新市人解囊前去的，當然不在少數吧！</p>
<p>二十二晚上，由杭州開新的小輪，說是被刦，選傷了一個乘客，這也是研究社會問題者的一個亟街研究的重要問題。</p>
<p>右手的傷，　，痛，不能動，氷冷，友人顧君的一針兩針，漸漸的見鬆。眞不過三天吧！已能够稍稍執　。於是趕忙地到上海來。</p>

<p>中日關稅協定期滿廢止</p>
<p>統一幣制整理各種稅收</p>
<p>行政院副院長宋子文、於昨晚乘夜夜快車離京、今晨八時許返滬、各報社記者今晨謁宋氏於私邸、據氏發表談話、汪精衛回任行政院長問題、今晨中政會决定後、即可正式復職、茲分誌宋氏談話如後、</p>
<h3 id="c256">汪即復職 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>宋氏表示、汪氏回任行政院院長、已絶對無問題、將俟今晨中央政治會議議决後、即可實行復職、負此後政治之全責、本人則專辦財政、故余目下所可與諸君談述者、亦限於財政方面之事項、余雖仍兼任行政院副院長、但副院長並無發表與行政院有關之談話之權也、</p>

<p>中日關稅協定、至五月十六日以後、即告期滿失效、無所謂續訂與否、因該項協定、只規定某種貨物諆　入口稅之維持一年及三年耳、初因我國與各國訂立關稅自主之協定、日本自亦不能例外、故維持其最低期限之稅率、故有此項規定、</p>

<p>關於整理稅收一項、華北方面、旣歸中央、華南方面、亦無問題、宋解釋稅收之統「、非完全由中央派人所辦理稅收、始謂之統一、蓋凡能依照中央之方法辦理、亦即統一之謂也、故中央對整理稅收一層、務求其成爲簡單化、至整理鹽稅、此時亦較以前爲佳、</p>

<p>日前各報載王茂盛君，初由瀋陽潛逃來滬，居然敢學要人嘴舌，發表談話一則，大致說我東北三千萬同胞，日逆所施以姦淫擄殺，没收財産之種種慘酷刑罰，己足使天地爲之黑暗丨乃對付我被擒之義勇軍，更施以什麽「五馬分屍」，以及從未見聞過的「倒吊樹梢，使其心血下流而死」之慢性殺人的毒刑，天壤間慘無人道，汚辱人類歷史之事，寗復尙有甚於此者，</p>

<p>— 葭祥</p>
<p>都知道的，要使木器美觀，祇需在木器上，塗上一種「吧唎　油」ＷoodVarnish，它就能使木器發光生亮。普通的吧　　油，僅以「洋乾漆」溶解在酒精中，或竟在洋乾漆中攙入一部份松脂，這種質地不純粹的吧唎　油，塗在木器上，它能保存光亮的時期很短。若照下面的方法，配製而成的吧唎　油，它能使光亮耐久，並且很易乾燥。可以供上等木器的應用：</p>
<p>原料名稱　配合分量</p>
<p>洋乾漆（Ｓhellac）…………４盎司Ｏunce</p>
<p>樟腦精（Refined　Campboi）１.43盎司</p>
<p>芸香（Sandarach）…………４盎司</p>
<p>松節油（Venice　Turpentine）……１／２盎司</p>
<p>凡内司凈松節油（）</p>
<p>１盎司</p>
<p>木棉酒（Methylated　Spirit）２０盎司（註）</p>
<p>乳香（Mastic）…………１／２盎司</p>
<p>製法：把右面各物，混合在一個洋磁鍋中，再加熱·等到各種東西完全溶解在木棉酒中，變成流體後，再取細紗布，把牠隔濾過，除去滓渣，裝入瓶中，吧唎　油就成了。</p>
<p>用法：吧唎　油裝在瓶中時，須要瓶塞密封，不要使牠漏氣。用的時候，把軟毛刷或布裏棉花，蘸些吧唎　　·輕塗在木器上，塗的時候，須要快而有次序，並且要均匀平滑。如要翻新曾塗過吧唎　油的舊木器，那麽也祇須直接塗上。要是想把新木器變成任何顔色，也祗須把任何「阿尼林」（Ａniline）顔料，溶解在沸水中，先塗在木上，等到乾透後，再塗上吧唎　油。假若想變做常見的橙黃色，那麽祇須用Bismarck　　rown攙入吧唎　油中，就可以直接塗在新木器上。</p>
<p>註，如木棉酒没有地方買，可以用純酒精代替。</p>

<h3 id="c275">太難爲了女兒呀 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>前次寄上一封「如此父母」的信，承蒙你在本月二十日的報上替我登載了。我見了那答復的信，便念着骨肉之情，立刻赴銀行將我半年之間在家用内節省下來的三百元，提了出來，去津貼娘家。那知他們得了此三百塊錢之後，替三個弟弟和兩個妹妹各人去買了一件三十元以上的大衣，各人又買了十幾元一雙的皮鞋，况且又到外國理髮店燙髮及洗髮；把我半年之間辛辛苦苦省下來之家用，一齊化在裝飾上，是多麽心痛呀！昨日母親又要求我再給他們一百元，我因爲他們並不愛惜我的錢，所以不答應她的要求，她便駡我守財奴，一些都没有姊妹的感情。先生請你告訴我，應該如何對待此種偏心的母親呢。即請撰安　蔣石梅影謹上</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>編者按：讀了蔣夫人這次的來信，我們才知道他的父母，確乎是太没有出息了：怪不得做女兒的不肯津貼他們呀！我們不敢再勸蔣夫人，將她丈夫以汗血換來的金錢，這樣糊裏糊塗的去使。因爲這可以使她的父母，一天一天的更墜落下去；而且還可以使她的弟妹，變成「但知揮霍，不知物力」的流浪者。</p>
<p>不道骨肉還有骨肉，蔣夫人不免要再用些精神；你的父母，年紀大了，倒也不成問題。可是你的弟妹，年紀尙輕，你非但不能看他們餓死不救，你應該積極的負赽了們的敎育責任。將來他們有出息，也是你的面子；而且還替中國造就幾個人才，至少也可以替國家减少幾個分利者。</p>
<p>所以我們主張，此後蔣夫人黨然不必無條件的將錢去津貼娘家；你應當擔任你弟妹的敎育費，不妨直接繳付校内，並且還要隨時去考查他們的功課。至於日常的東西，看他們正眞需要的時候，買些去送給他們。講到你母親的惡言相向，你也不必掛在胸中，好在誰是誰非，旁邊人都看得很清的呀！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「没有！一定没有！我可以發誓的說没有！」伍逸把一柄刷衣服的衣刷，在那安着沙濾水瓶的一個木架子上，用力的敲着。「如非你說國民黨就是中華民國，那末他們的黨歌，當然便是國歌了！但是我第一個就不承認」！</p>
<p>「老咆且慢生氣，商量正事要緊」！馬利國忙把談鋒移到主文上來。「因爲方才船主跟我商量：他說船過檀香山，上來了一位貴客，那便是我們國民政府派往美國去的全權公使劉博士　他們爲表示聨絡中美兩國人士的感情起見，打算在今天晚餐的時候，敎他們的樂隊吹打一支中國的國歌。但是他們那裏却没有譜，便要求我給他們寫出來。假使，……假使你的話是眞的，這事情不就糟了嗎？我們怎能說中國是没有國歌的」！</p>
<p>「啊！……哈哈！原來是這樣的一會事。可是我們中國眞没有國歌，這便怎麽處呢」？伍逸又氣又好笑的答復着。</p>
<p>「奈道眞没有嗎」？馬利國還是不能完全相信。</p>
<p>「眞没有！大槪也是政府方面，因爲國庫空虚，所以無力撰製了」！除了這一個「曲解」之外，就是把善于辭令的晏平仲老夫子，打棺材裏扶起來，怕也不能有别的充分的理由，給人家解釋大中華民國之所以没有國歌的緣故了！</p>
<p>「那末，你老兄是著作大家，就請你臨時做一支出來吧」！馬利國眞不愧爲中國要人的兒子。對于中國政治舞台上歷次起了什麽變化，隨便濫拉同黨中人，充任各部部長的一套把戲，看得極熟悉；以爲只要是稍具一技之長的脚色，便是無所不能的寳貨了：當過軍長的，儘可兼任外交；當過大學校長的，何妨改署交通。因此，他也以爲伍逸旣是一位著作家，當然必能塡製歌譜的了！</p>
<p>「這不是笑話嗎！休說我不懂音樂，不能塡，就是能塡，國歌也不是隨便可以杜造的！記得以前國民黨没有執政，東三省没有失陷之前，我們倒有一支很雄壯的國歌，就是那「卿云綢兮……」的一支；但是現在，可要不得，你要如再唱一句，便逃不走反革命的罪名，也許就有槍斃的希望！……哈哈！……一伍逸極沉痛地調笑着。「不過，他們如其眞要演奏的話，你大可直接去請敎劉公使自己。看他怎樣吩咐」？</p>
<p>「不錯！不錯！」馬利國深喜借此可和劉公使接近，便眞的去了。</p>
<p>他這一去，足足去了四十分鐘才回來，態度很興奮，手裏端端整整的捧着一個信封。「你的話眞對！劉公使也說，我們的國歌還不曾産生；但是他已想了一個折中的辦法，他親自寫了這封信，敎我轉交給船長。你看吧」！</p>
<p>伍逸果然打那信封裏抽出了兩頁信紙來。一瞧，第一頁是一封極漂亮的英文信。大意是說：「中國國歌，譜極複雜，一時實難繕出；但旣蒙諸君盛情，擬奏敝國國樂，以示歡迎鄙人之意，則亦未敢過使諸君失望。用特錄奉敝國古曲一支，乃當時描寫使臣出使異邦，至死不屈之精神者。………」第二頁，便是蘇武牧羊曲」的樂譜。</p>
<p>「好一個折中辦法！眞不愧爲一位老外交家」！伍逸很滿意地讚頌着：「要不然，没有國歌的中國人，眞不知道怎樣才好遮羞咧」！</p>

<p>— 馨甫</p>
<p>在烏發攝影探險隊隊長烏利克叔爾次博士Ｄr·Ulrich　K·T·Ｓchulz從北歐回到柏林的第三天，有一位記者到烏發公司去訪問他·一脚跨進了博士的辦事室，看上去，就很像一間科學家或是探險家的研究室·他們就在這樣一個地方，毫不客氣的開談起來：</p>
<p>「你要看我嗎？好，那末就請你把要問我的話說出來吧！」</p>
<p>「請你告訴我，在我進來以前，你正在想着什麽？」</p>
<p>「你想！一個離開柏林五個月，剛從北歐工作回來的我：除掉那在北歐所拍的片子和那些地方的人情風俗外我還會想着什麽别的事情呢？相信我，那北方的物物事事，都和這裏不同的，我早就有「到北歐去」的心思了，却被那北歐的嚴寒天氣，屢次挫折了我的勇氣，但是現在終於被我達到目的了·這次多謝那精良的器械，使得我們拍了許多很有價值的影片·我們不僅在水面上和水底下去攝取景物：並且還駕着飛機到空中去攝取。一萬五千尺高，是算不了一回事的·那挪威峽江的海口，横互大陸二百六十英里·我們除坐着飛機渡過外，還曾坐着帆船，在斷巖絶壁的夾岸中，來來往往·</p>
<p>取魚羣在靜水中産卵的情形·」</p>
<p>「你願把這一次最富有興趣的經歷告訴我嗎？」</p>
<p>「十分願意，在峽江的靠岸上，樹着許多花兒開得正盛的樹木·你想這樣美麗的樹木，在它的背面，是懸崖斷壁和白雪，在它的前面，是一片汪洋大海·這是多麽有趣的天然美景呢！所以，我們在飛渡峽江的時候，曾用反光攝影法去攝取了很多的奇景·」</p>
<p>「什麽呌反光攝影法，可否解釋給我聽嗎？」</p>
<p>「平常的攝影。是和太陽光相對的·這樣好呌那目的物，受着陽光，而反射出光線來；但是我們攝影，是反對着太陽光的·這種方法·發明未久，不但便利，且以前不能攝取的奇景，現在都能夠攝取了：像我們這次所攝取的急流瀑布的美景，都是採用這種法子的·（未完）</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c278">關於「都會的早晨」的幾篇來稿 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<h3 id="c279">（一）牠是偉大的成功 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴繼陵</p>
<p>在意識方面，它也獲得了偉大成功。它並没有小資産階級幻滅的空想，它指示了大衆光明的前途。它告訴了勞苦的大衆：什麽都不要怕，也不要受富人虚僞的憐憫，也不要貪圖一己的亨受：只有在艱苦壓迫的生活之下，奮力的爭扎，男敢的給予壓迫者以無情的，殘酷的捶擊，才是勞苦大衆的出路。</p>
<p>表演方面，高占非和王人美都非常有力。袁叢美的反派，確是老手。唐槐秋在初出現的時候，太覺呆板，以後還不差。其餘如王桂林，劉繼羣都很可以。扮幼年許蘭光的嚴朶匀，很有表演的天才，是一個可造的孩子。</p>
<h3 id="c280">（二）他亦說劇情偉大 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 馮瑛</p>
<p>劇本的眞諦，我們是值得欽佩的，他處處顯示出勞工的神聖，高尙，但在畸形社會下的中國，非但貧富的階級懸殊，而且社會的經濟，也分配太不均衡，以致造成神聖，高尙的勞工們，每天勞働所得的酬報，僅能勉强地維持個人的生活，而那些不事生産的資本家，很安舒地過着不勞而獲的生活，都會的早晨一片，是爲大衆的神聖，高尙的勞工們作有力的呐喊，同時在另一方面，無疑地，給時代的人們以偉大的啓示。</p>
<p>至於演員方面，高占非那樣的剛毅堅强的深刻表演，使吾感發無限的同情，王人美的天眞漫爛，祗覺得她可愛極了，王桂林的慈父愛子，看了簡直　人淚下。</p>
<p>總之，該片在表演，意義的種種方面，已獲得極大的成功，可是在情節方面，似乎有點覺得不大緊凑。</p>
<p>「萬花獻媚」是一部熱的歌舞鉅片由埃第康泰主演今日開映於光陸蘭心大戲院。</p>
<h3 id="c281">（三）但有矛盾欠缺之處 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 椀</p>
<p>沉浸在黑暗都市裏頭的人們，苦悶極了！誰不憬幢着有一線晨光之到來，照我們走上光明之路呢？因此「都市的早晨」就應着時代的要求，而出映了。牠和「城市之夜」正是銜接一氣的片子；劇情，表演，攝影，一切的一切，都有異曲同工之妙。不過「城市之夜」的力量，比較還要深刻一點！這張片子也算是聨華的成功作。不過細看起來，裏頭還有不少的漏洞</p>
<p>第一，是許多演員，不會走路。動步太快，顯出太怱遽的樣子。</p>
<p>第二，是工人拉車子的時候，完全不用力，顯著是在拍戲。</p>
<p>第三，農村裏頭的小三子，打諢的地方，嫌多一點。</p>
<p>這些是表演的缺點；還有劇情方面，亦有矛盾糢糊之處。</p>

<p>— 趙鵬</p>
<p>洪深田漢建議</p>
<p>聨華公司採用</p>
<p>斯文學作家沈從文（茅盾）近作的長篇小說「子夜一，描寫深刻，寓意精深，極得社會人士之熱烈歡迎，電影戲劇界鉅子洪深田漢等，特向聨華公司建議，主張將沈氏的長篇小說「子夜」改編爲電影劇本，業已得聨華公司導演蔡楚生同意，惟沈氏欲求保持其作品眞面目起見，特要求當局，編成劇本不能改變作者的本旨，主角演員，須對戲劇文藝有修養者擔任；關於心理描寫之處，由作者親自導演，俾體貼入微，公司當局，深韙其意，刻正在計劃一切，一俟就緒，即將拍攝云。</p>
<h3 id="c283">（四）推崇高袁的幾句話 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>高占非主演的片子，總算我領敎了不少了。然而能夠差强人意的，就不多見。「粉紅色的夢」和開映未久的「天明」，在一部份的人或者認爲是他的成功；我却以爲那還祗登堂而未入室，「都會的早晨」公映了以後，才算告訴了我們他已經升進藝術之階，得窺堂奥了。在這裏他是無暇可擊。不過我同時發現了他這次的成功，劇本却給了他不少的助力。否則繼有表演的天才，也就等於「英雄無用武之地」。</p>
<p>袁叢美我可以不必說了，祇要把蔡楚生的話借用一次就行；「……在他的純潔的生活中，罪惡是無從闖入的，但由於他的想像和創造，事實上已造成他在銀幕上唯一的反派明星的地位。……並且要感謝他在「都會的早晨」：在反面上增加了不少的力量。」誠然，想像和創造，這在每個明星的成功上是不可少的要素，不僅袁叢美個人就應當如此。</p>
<h3 id="c284">（五）年號應加注意 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>全劇的取材，完全以暗示着人們以遺産的流毒和勞工的神聖使銀幕下的觀衆，得以認識那人生的眞義，和無的放矢，一意胡閙的劇本當然有不同樣的結果，和不同樣的功效。我們自然不能不說這劇本的成功！</p>
<p>演員方面，人材是很平均謬疵的地方很少而尤其使得我們贊美的便是王人美的蘭兒，她一種活潑天眞的情狀演來恰恰是適合於一個村姑的身分，我們很希望聨華的導演們能抓住她的個性，使她能發展她的演劇天才。</p>
<p>不過從我的主觀上說來，都會的早晨呢，全劇的序幕，覺得還有些疏鬆而不能到達十分緊張的境地，至於表示時間的前進的年期我覺得中國的影片，應當用民國×年而不必去用一九一九丨丨一九三三等字幕來表示，因爲我們中國也自有固有的年號，又何必去借用西曆呢？不知讀者以爲何如？</p>

<p>— 雲君</p>
<p>最近在好萊塢老鄉村中發生一宗新奇的事件，就是行將六十五歲的英籍老明星喬治亞立斯的「五里計劃」，就是每天早上他要走五英里路。</p>
<p>在卡休恩加（Cahueng）道上，老當益壯的亞立斯先生一步一步的向前踱着。他的汽車和他的汽車夫在後面跟著。</p>
<p>當亞立斯先生覺得有一點兒步履維艱的時候，他就自動他走向汽車，躍進車中。結果所謂五英里的步行只走了五分之一，其餘的四英里是由亞立斯的汽車載着走的。心有餘而力不足，因此轟動一時的「五里計劃」宣告失敗了。</p>
<h3 id="c287">“Ｃavalcade”（忠魂錄）攝製經過記 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 凛</p>
<p>美國福斯公司新攝鉅片名Ｃavalcade者，原書出諸英國名小說作家諾爾老華德氏Ｎoel　Coward手筆，英倫三島，傳誦一時，視爲國家光榮之傑構。美國福斯公司以鉅欵向作者購得影片攝製權，加以　珞之攝製。英國全國輿論爲之譁然，指老華德此舉爲辱國之行爲。今福斯公司已費數百萬金錢將此片攝製完成。大西洋兩岸，俱爲之轟動，價值之偉，可想而知矣。茲擬將此劇本事，節譯充實申報電影刋。惟此片攝製之先，遺自逸事，未經人道者尚夥，茲特掇要述之，以作譯文之先導焉。</p>
<p>此書之大旨，歷述二十世紀初葉以來，英國所受戰禍之慘烈，與夫某巨宦（書中之主人翁）家室蕩析流離之苦，而以十九世紀末葉維多利亞后時代之承平景象爲對照，其中頗多情感動人之處。作者之以攝影權售諸好萊塢，原非圖博厚利。今福斯公司片成，作者之心，庶可告無愧於英倫之國人，蓋此種偉大之財力，爲攝製此片，幾將一九零零年全倫敦一切名勝遷植好萊塢，使當年遺老游其地者，幾疑疑三十年前之故都，往往有爲之感泣不成聲者，可知佈置之精偉矣。</p>

<p>League of Nations Advisory Committee Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Council Seat Vacancy Sparks Competition</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations has been transmitted by telegraph to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond at 3:10 PM today. The Secretariat immediately replied to the Japanese Foreign Minister and promptly forwarded the Japanese telegram along with the League of Nations' reply to all member states of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will only become effective after two years. However, several national leaders are already considering reorganizing the Administrative Council after Japan's withdrawal from its permanent seat. Smaller nations are increasingly resentful of the Administrative Council's control, especially in handling the Sino-Japanese dispute and the disarmament conference. Recently, such ominous sentiments have shown signs of escalating into open rebellion. Therefore, political observers do not consider the movement to reform the Administrative Council or change the election system to be strange. Today, the Evening Standard anticipates internal turmoil within the League of Nations, similar to what happened before Germany joined the League in 1926. The newspaper believes that the Little Entente countries have long considered themselves great powers and will eventually demand to fill the seat vacated by Japan. France, Poland, and some smaller nations will undoubtedly support them, but Italy, Germany, and other countries opposed to the French faction will resist this as well. Therefore, the League of Nations Administrative Council may soon become the focus of conflicting European fears and ambitions. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of major powers and some smaller nations have slightly differing opinions on whether it is beneficial to convene a 21-member Advisory Committee meeting under the current circumstances. From the perspective of major powers, it is questionable whether the committee can discuss Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and whether the US representative's attendance at this meeting will exceed the scope of authority. However, Advisory Committee Chairman Lange decided to take action as before before the representatives leave for the Easter holiday. Therefore, a meeting was scheduled for 5:30 PM today.

<h3 id="e2">Mandated Islands Issue <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) In the House of Commons today, Conservative Party member Baxter inquired about the proper handling of mandated territories under the control of a League of Nations member that withdraws from the League. Under-Secretary Eden replied that the British government is considering the issue, but because major powers have not yet discussed it, the British government cannot express its position at this time. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) The State Department believes that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations was expected. The United States will not change its policies towards Japan and the League of Nations as a result. The US government is committed to maintaining world peace and will continue to cooperate closely with the League of Nations while independently resolving the Far Eastern issue. The US representative will follow the State Department's reply to the League of Nations on March 13, participating in the Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations to monitor the Far Eastern issue. The US authorities are extremely concerned about the issue of Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific, especially within naval circles, because if Japan and the United States come into conflict, these islands will be of great strategic importance. American newspapers have repeatedly criticized Japan for building fortifications in the Caroline Islands. In January of this year, the Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department stated that the mandate system originated from the European War. Although the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, it was a participating party in the war, and therefore has the right to participate in all views and decisions regarding the mandate territories. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, Japanese newspapers reported that the Japanese and German governments began consultations on the 4th of this month regarding the continuation of the administration of the former German colonies in the Pacific after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The Berlin government authority stated today that this is not the case. Therefore, all German opinions and actions related to this issue propagated by the Japanese side are unfounded fabrications. Furthermore, Germany's view on this issue remains the same as announced a few days ago, without any changes. (National Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The news reported in Japanese newspapers regarding the administration of the Caroline Islands, claiming it was stated to a Japanese interviewer by National Socialist Party member Rosenberg, is now refuted by the National Socialist Party's official newspaper, which states that Rosenberg has not met with any Japanese interviewers.

Subsequently, a certain regiment took the opportunity to launch an attack, and the other units, hearing the news, rose up and leaped out of the trenches to launch a counterattack. The enemy suffered a major defeat, fleeing in disarray. Our troops pursued for five or six li, but withdrew to their original positions to defend them as it was getting late. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army failed to attack Xifengkou and Luowenyu, they are deploying the 14th Division for reinforcements, preparing for the second phase of operations. Commander of the Kwantung Army, Muto Nobuyoshi, is currently planning everything in Chengde. Currently, the focus of the war has shifted to the Shihe and Gubeikou lines.

<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, a little after 5:00 PM, three enemy aircraft reconnoitered and bombed the area of Jiumentou, Shimenzhai, Hanzhuang, and Haiyang Town. The extent of the damage is unknown. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Battle Situation on the Qing Shankou Front <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Due to transportation obstructions in the Qing Shankou area for days, news of the war has been quiet. Today, a senior officer of Wan Biao Miao's division arrived in Ping and said that on the 16th, more than 300 enemies bypassed to Guo Jiazhangziling Zhuang. A certain regiment of our army was bombed to death by enemy aircraft. Fortunately, a certain regiment reinforced and fought hard, regaining the original position, killing more than 200 enemies. However, a certain regiment only had five companies left. Both sides suffered heavy losses. On the morning of the 23rd, more than 500 enemy infantry attacked Jielingkou and were repelled. Immediately after, they launched a joint infantry and artillery attack on a certain regiment position of our Miao Division. After resisting with all their might for two days and nights, the enemy failed and retreated. Because the enemy reinforced several times, our army transferred a certain regiment of Sun Division to reinforce. From the early morning to noon of the 24th, the enemy, with more than 20 aircraft in formation, more than 10 artillery pieces, and more than 1,000 infantry, jointly attacked our facing position. Division Commander Miao retreated to defend the Ma Fang line because the ratio of soldiers was too different. On the evening of the 24th, a certain regimental commander of the Sun Division led a certain battalion to detour to the right flank to assist the Miao Division, restoring the original position, killing hundreds of enemies and capturing a lot of enemy guns and baggage. At noon on the 25th, a certain regiment of the Sun Division, which detoured behind the enemy, encountered more than 100 enemy ammunition and supply vehicles and more than 100 puppet Japanese enemy soldiers at Caojiadian. They were surrounded by our army and wiped out. (Special dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Island telegram states that Qin Island and Shihe are both safe and Shimenzhai is undamaged, firmly defended by Jin Tuan. A few days ago, Yuguan increased Japanese soldiers by more than 200, and more than 100 puppet troops came from Suizhong, with three mountain cannons, stationed near Dongluocheng. The enemy often reconnoiters our Shihe position, and communicates with lights on the Yuguan city wall at night. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the Luowenyu front, there have only been small clashes recently. The enemy's newly arrived troops, after being defeated at Banbishan, have now retreated to the Shouwangmu area, about seventy or eighty li from Luowenyu. Our cavalry is tracking, scouting, and pursuing them. The enemy is extremely brutal in harassing the villagers in the rear, forcibly pulling civilians every day to carry the wounded. Those who disobey are killed. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At about 4:00 PM on the 27th, the enemy used 400-500 plainclothes troops to sneak attack our Xifengkou area. After our army discovered them, the garrison soldiers did not fire their guns, waiting for them to get closer, and then attacked them fiercely with grenades, followed by slashing with knives. More than 200 enemies were killed, with corpses everywhere. The enemies who continued to advance, seeing the ferocity of our broadsword fighters and grenades, fled in panic. Our side only had 14 soldiers injured. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua telegram states that on the Xifengkou front, the enemy has withdrawn from Mengziling towards Kuancheng. For days, no enemy aircraft have attacked Xifengkou and Zunhua. It is rumored that when Shao Benliang defected, he burned more than 100 enemy aircraft. The enemy on the Luowenyu front was forced to withdraw to Liuhe after our Liu Ruming Division occupied Banbishan. Our cavalry tracked and pursued them. There was fierce fighting near Liuhe yesterday. The Rehe militia could not bear the enemy's slaughter and often launched night attacks on the enemy camps with broadsword teams on the 23rd. The enemy is extremely afraid of them. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told Quan Shaowu, a representative of the support association, that according to reports from the front, the Japanese army at Luowenyu retreated from Banbishan on the 25th and has now retreated to a place ninety li away from Luowenyu. The Japanese army at Xifengkou retreated to Mengziling on the 25th and is constructing fortifications. They retreated again on the 26th and have passed Kuancheng. As for the reasons for the retreat, one is that the Japanese army's military discipline is too bad, harassing everywhere, and the people often come out to attack at night, and the other is that our army is putting great pressure on them. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Jinzhou) [Unclear characters] Brigade on the Lengkou front has received reinforcements, preventing the Japanese army from advancing. The Japanese [unclear characters] flying team, led by the team leader from Qian Dao, departed from the [unclear characters] airfield at 9:00 AM yesterday, and started fierce bombing from the point where it flew over the Chinese military position. The sound of artillery fire has been deafening yesterday, suppressing the Great Wall of China, and a large fierce battle that has never been seen before has unfolded. (Dentsu telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>To Disrupt Our Army's Rear</p>
<p>Establishing Secret Organizations in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the Japanese side has been repeatedly unsuccessful in attacking, they are using money to buy off bandits, giving them two yuan per day, specifically to disrupt our army's rear. They have established secret organizations in Tianjin and have also established a machine in Hankou to supply the communist army with weapons upstream of the Yangtze River. The weapons are transported by Japanese warships to Hankou, Daye, and other places, secretly hidden in Japanese residences, and then secretly transported by small boats on both sides of the Yangtze River. Also, the Japanese army uniforms outside the Great Wall are yellow wool on the outside and gray cloth on the inside. When the two armies are close, they can switch the inside to the outside, attempting to confuse our line of sight. This trick has been seen through by us. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Importance of Duolun and Zhangjiakou's Strategic Location <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Before invading Rehe, Japan claimed that they would only attack Rehe and would not cross the Great Wall in order to ease international criticism and facilitate military operations. Now, Shanhaiguan has already fallen into enemy hands, and all the key passes along the Great Wall, from Gubeikou, Panjiakou, Xifengkou, and Jielingkou to Lengkou and Shimen, are filled with smoke and the sounds of cannons. Even if the outcome is still unknown, the continuous advance of the Japanese army is an obvious and undeniable fact. Furthermore, enemy aircraft frequently fly over the airspace of Zunhua and Miyun to reconnoiter, drop bombs, and wantonly threaten, indicating that the war has extended to the territory of Hebei Province. "Rehe's fall" shows that we did not make full efforts to defend it, which has opened the door for the enemy to covet more. With the repeated loss of natural barriers, it will be even more difficult to resist the enemy in the future. Some believe that the international relations in the Ping [Beiping] and Tianjin areas are complex, and even though Japan is barbaric, it is still aware of its capabilities and dares not act rashly, putting itself in a difficult situation and taking great military risks. Because of this, our country may be able to enjoy a temporary respite. However, we must realize that the situation is evolving and does not allow us to rest for a moment. Yuguan and Rehe are the most serious lessons for our people.</p>
<p>Even worse, now that Japan has seized Rehe, it will be very easy for them to invade North China, and their plot to incite Mongolia has been brewing for a long time. Previously, when Rehe was in our hands, we could indirectly provide supplies to the righteous army, take back Tongliao by taking advantage of the slope of the Shun Qilao Tu mountain range, seize the Siping-Taonan Railway, and take the opportunity to restore the Northeast. Now, the geographical advantage has been shared with the enemy, and they can look down on Northeast China from a high position and spy on Pingjin, while we have become guests and are easily restricted. However, they still have some concerns because Duolun is to their north and Zhangjiakou is around their waist. If our country is determined to get rid of years of bad habits and mobilize the whole country to resist the war, it would not be difficult to recover Rehe. Therefore, the enemy also has the intention of invading Duolun first and then spying on Zhangjiakou. Although this still needs to be proven by facts, judging from Japan's recent actions, it is likely true.</p>
<p>First, Japanese imperialists have been deliberately invading Mongolia for more than a day. Many princes and nobles of various Inner Mongolian leagues have been seduced by them. Now, they are using the name of the puppet state to lure them, and they will certainly be more reckless and expand their invasion area.</p>
<p>Second, Inner and Outer Mongolia are adjacent to each other, and Zhangjiakou and Kulun are important passages to the Soviet Union. Recently, the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union has become a reality. Even if a military alliance is not yet the time, it will not be difficult for China and the Soviet Union to reach further understanding if there is a war between Japan and the two countries. However, since Japan is bound to dominate maritime transport in the Western Pacific, the safety of maritime traffic between China and the Soviet Union cannot be guaranteed. The most important route is the Zhang-Ku passage. Therefore, Japan is eager to attack Zhangjiakou to cut off the land connection between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Third, the Northwest has a vast land with sparse population, rich products, simple customs, and abundant resources that are no less than those of the Northeast. The Wuyuan granary is the source of life for the provinces of Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Shanxi. Japanese nationalists have long wanted to seize the life of our country's northern region. Therefore, they will extend their clutches and sweep Inner Mongolia to fulfill their dream of a Greater East Asia Monroe Doctrine.</p>
<p>These three points are enough to determine that Japan has long been determined to invade Zhangjiakou. Moreover, Zhangjiakou is the most important support point of the Ping-Sui Railway and is also related to Rehe. If our country truly wants to resist Japan, we must regard Zhangjiakou as the northern center and complete the railway from Datong to Shaanzhou as quickly as possible so that our arteries can be connected and we can use them conveniently, take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses, and use our strengths to deal with the enemy, and be able to defend the key points and not be taken advantage of by the enemy again. Then we can establish a foothold and plan an active counterattack. Therefore, today, whether we adopt a temporary defensive posture or an active counterattack, we cannot retreat any further in the territory of Hebei, and Duolun is the northern gateway lock, and Zhangjiakou is the support point of Ping Sui. We must do our best to maintain them. On the one hand, we should give full supplies to Sun Dianying's troops and others fighting on the front line so that they can do their best to fight guerrilla warfare to contain the enemy's forces. On the other hand, we should launch a large army to rectify the anti-Japanese steps, not only making the area between Duolun and Zhangjiakou a golden city for thousands of miles, but also build fortresses along the Shangdu River to Fengning, relying on the Wuling Mountains, to form mutually supporting positions with the Gubeikou garrison. If it is convenient, we can advance and take Le Ping to recover Chengde. Otherwise, we should defend ourselves firmly as a preparation for an active counterattack. Then there is still hope for salvation.</p>

A fierce battle ensued with our defending troops. We urgently dispatched a certain regiment for reinforcement and surrounded the enemy. Subsequently, over a hundred Mongol cavalrymen outflanked our left flank at Simatai, and fierce fighting ensued.

<p>Rumors of Japanese Plans to Create Puppet Mongolian State</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military authorities received a telegram from Duolun stating that the situation in Eastern Chahar has recently become tense again. Japanese troops east of Chuizishan are attempting to infiltrate Chahar through mountain paths and are planning to create a puppet Mongolian state, with the three special districts of Suiyuan, Chahar, and Ningxia, which lie outside the Great Wall, as the territory of the puppet Mongolian state. They are adopting the same means as they used to create the puppet Manchurian state: after a military invasion, they will use traitors as puppets to call upon and incite the Mongols. Currently, our forces in the vicinity of Duolun and the western Chuizishan line are fully prepared. We will strike if the enemy comes, and there will be no problem in defending the Chahar territory. However, the Japanese bandits are getting more and more bold, so we must work together to find a way to resist them and maintain our territory. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Shang Zhen Reports on the Recent Military Situation</p>
<p>Our Military Positions Are Solid and Well-Organized</p>
<p>Fierce Battles Expected in a Week</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A reporter accompanied Shao Yuanchong, Lu Dangping, and others to inspect the front lines. They arrived in Kaiping at 2:30 PM on the 27th. Shang Zhen, the general commander of the Second Army Corps, welcomed them at the station and hosted a dinner. Shang reported on the anti-Japanese efforts at Lengkou. Shao immediately expressed his condolences and said that sacrificing for the nation and the country was a great honor. He quoted the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, saying, "Even if we cannot succeed, we should still strive for benevolence." He stated that resisting Japan was the best opportunity for armed comrades to achieve benevolence and would surely receive enthusiastic support from the entire nation. Shang told the reporter that after the loss of Chengde, the Northeast Army's morale was low, and they feared being surrounded, so they retreated in different directions. The Miyama detachment of the Nakamura unit of the enemy's 32nd Regiment, consisting of over 2,000 men, advanced in over a hundred tanks, armored vehicles, and trucks from the Lingyuan-Nanling area, charging wildly as if entering an uninhabited land. They then drove south from Dazhangzi and occupied Lengkou on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. Our army received orders to advance on the 5th and immediately dispatched the Huang Guanghua division, which marched urgently through the night. They recaptured Lengkou on the 6th and pursued the enemy twenty li, occupying the Madaogou position. Miyama then led his troops to attack Xifengkou and Gubeikou and later led his troops to attack Lengkou again, suffering heavy losses from our army's repeated night attacks. In the last five or six days, they have not dared to attack, only sending aircraft to harass us every morning, with the first reconnaissance, and two, three or four bombardments, each time with four aircraft dropping twenty to thirty bombs. There was a strong wind and rain on the 26th and 25th, and the front line was very quiet. The military telephone lines were broken and repaired on the night of the 27th. At 8 PM, Shang accompanied Shao and Lu in a special train to Luozhou, where they transferred to cars and went to the front line via Qian'an. At 2 AM on the 28th, they met with division commanders Huang Guanghua and Gao Hongwen, who both expressed their determination to sacrifice for the country. Huang told the reporter that the enemy planes were old-fashioned, and the villages in the area had been bombed miserably, with many casualties among the people, who had now all been evacuated. Our army suffered few casualties. We had anti-aircraft machine guns, which the enemy feared, flying at altitudes above 2,000 meters. On the morning of the 27th, using binoculars to observe the enemy planes, they were single-wing Junkers type, with machine guns in the front; this was the first time this was observed. A total of sixty bombs were dropped in Yaozhuangzi, Jianchangying, Tangzhangzi, and other places, each bomb weighing over 200 pounds, creating craters over ten feet deep upon impact. The enemy had about twenty cannons, which they fired at our side from time to time. According to intelligence, the enemy has requested reinforcements and heavy artillery from the rear, predicting that there will be fierce battles in a week. Shao delivered words of consolation, as before. Lu said that the Beijing Local Autonomy Guidance Committee had raised a lot of funds and asked what the front lines needed to purchase. Huang said they needed shoes, socks, broadswords, cars, and hospital beds, and Lu promised to take care of it upon returning to Beijing. At 4 AM, they arrived at Lengkou by car and then walked six or seven li outside the pass to inspect the positions, which were exceptionally solid and well-organized. At dawn, the rumbling sound of cannons entered their ears, and they learned that the enemy was firing from Xiaojiadian, but our side did not respond. At 6:30 AM, they returned to Lengkou by car and returned to Luozhou. At 10 AM, they arrived in Kaiping. At noon, Shang requested Shao to give instructions and encouragement to the officers and generals under his command on the value of sacrificing for the country. At 7 PM, they arrived in Tianjin, and Shao scheduled to go to Beijing on the morning of the 29th to give lectures at various universities before returning to Nanjing.

<p>Wang Jingwei Has Agreed to Resume His Post</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Premier Wang and Chairman Jiang met and conferred in Nanjing, Wang's resumption of his post as Premier of the Executive Yuan has become a non-issue. Neither Wang nor Song attended the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th because Wang has not yet resumed his post, and Song has already resigned. The matter of resumption of the post will be decided by the Central Political Council on the 29th, or some say it will be decided by the Central Standing Committee on the 30th. Jiang visited Wang again at 6 PM on the 28th for further talks. In short, the matter will be resolved within days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo told reporters on the morning of the 28th that Wang has agreed to resume his post, pending a decision by the Central Standing Committee on the 30th. Chu Minyi said that Premier Wang, seeing the increasingly dangerous national situation and after repeated urging from various parties, has no reason to decline the resumption of his post. According to another person close to Wang, Wang has been consulting with the Central Government for days, focusing on rectifying domestic affairs and foreign policy, and is no longer insistent on resigning. However, when Wang left the country, the Central Government only approved a leave of absence. If he returns to work after the leave, only a report will be submitted to the Central Political Council or the Central Standing Committee. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>League of Nations Secretary-General's Reply Arrives in Tokyo</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond sent the following reply to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations sent by the Imperial Government yesterday. The reply especially quoted the full text of Article 1, Paragraph 3, of the Covenant, so it is worth noting whether there are any underlying implications. (Reply) To His Excellency Foreign Minister Uchida: This Secretary-General has received the telegram from your Excellency of the 27th. In the conclusion of your telegram, the Japanese Government, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 3, of the Covenant, notifies the intention of Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. Article 1, Paragraph 3, states that "A Member of the League may, after two years’ notice of its intention so to do, withdraw from the League, provided that all its international obligations and all its obligations under this Covenant shall have been fulfilled at the time of its withdrawal." This Secretary-General will immediately transmit this reply and your telegram to the member states. Drummond. (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since receiving Japan's official notification of withdrawal, the League of Nations has convened an advisory committee, apparently to decide on a course of action. The naval high command generally holds the following observations: Although the League of Nations is not familiar with the situation in the Far East, it will not be swayed by the instigation of small countries to impose an economic blockade under Article 16 of the Covenant. However, the possibility of economic pressure under Article 10 or 11 of the Covenant cannot be ruled out. The most important thing to pay attention to is the embargo on weapons to both China and Japan, which is a possibility. If it is a narrow embargo on weapons, Japan currently imports only about 2 million in gold from Germany, the UK, and Belgium, while China imports 15 million in gold from the UK, the US, and France. Therefore, the countries that will find it difficult are the UK, the US, and France, which trade with China, while it will be irrelevant to Japan. However, the most important thing to be wary of is the embargo on weapons interpreted in a broad sense. If cotton and other military supplies are included, it will be a disguised form of economic pressure, which is essentially the same as the economic sanctions under Article 16. Therefore, depending on how things develop, it may provoke a dispute, and this is the most important point to be wary of. (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(London) The Times said in an editorial today, "The impact of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations will only be felt gradually in the future, as Japan's withdrawal will not take effect for two years under the law. However, the League's power in the Far East will be weakened as a result. Japan's cooperation seems to cease whenever there is a possibility that its country may suffer temporary disadvantage. Japan has already notified the League that it intends to increase its military equipment rather than reduce it, and that it wants to have a freer hand in China. Even if Japan's claim that China is not an organized country and therefore Japan cannot maintain normal relations with China is not fabricated, it is for this reason that the powers concerned must not interfere in China for their own benefit. In the future, the mutual trust between Japan and other countries that have signed the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact will naturally be interrupted, and the nature of the League will become more European as an indirect result of Japan's withdrawal."</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph said, "The League of Nations will feel increasingly incomplete due to the withdrawal of the strongest country in the Far East. In legal terms, Japan has violated the League's rules. There are now various suggestions in Geneva regarding Japan's withdrawal, but economic resistance and arms embargoes, or empty talk of reclaiming the trusteeship of the South Pacific islands, will not help and will only increase unnecessary hatred. It is not too late for the League of Nations to discuss this issue again when it is formally raised."</p>
<p>The Daily Express said, "Japan cannot make its illegal actions legal by sending a telegram to Geneva, and the League of Nations cannot reduce its responsibility to China because of a telegram from Japan."</p>
<p>The News Chronicle said, "Past experience makes it unnecessary to attach importance to Japan's self-proclaimed efforts for peace. The League of Nations, with the close cooperation of the US and Russia, must find a way to maintain peace in Liaodong." (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Journal of Paris commented on Japan's withdrawal today, saying that the League of Nations is now suffering from immature universalism, but the forced withdrawal of the only major Asian country that has adopted Western customs and methods is a strange way to remedy a defect. It also said that what has been lost due to past events is not Japan. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, German semi-official sources believe that the League of Nations should not be disappointed by this, saying that although Japan has announced its withdrawal, it must continue to bear the obligations of a member state for two years. During this period, the dispute between the League of Nations and Japan is certainly not absolutely impossible to resolve. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the adjournment of yesterday's emergency cabinet meeting regarding the withdrawal from the League, Prime Minister Saito spoke of his feelings, saying, "I am filled with fear upon receiving the imperial rescript regarding the withdrawal. From now on, the government and the people must work together to ensure that the diplomatic policy after the withdrawal is based on world peace and the happiness of the people. However, concrete measures cannot be clearly stated today, as the international political situation is subtle. I urge the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seek comprehensive measures. The day before yesterday, I met with Finance Minister Takahashi to discuss matters related to the closing of the Diet. I still intend to take charge of the current situation and have no intention of resigning. I also intend to visit Prince Saionji as soon as possible to report in detail on the political situation up to today. The theory of the return to constitutional rule is recently rampant among political parties, which is what I hope for. However, in order to achieve this, the political parties must first revitalize themselves and gain the trust of the people." (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is generally believed that the current cabinet will collapse after the end of the Diet, but Prime Minister Saito believes that the extraordinary situation has not yet been resolved, and he seems to have decided to continue in office. He will disclose this decision when he visits Prince Saionji at the beginning of next month and at the local officials' conference. Therefore, the political situation may temporarily remain as it is.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida told reporters today regarding Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations that other powers should understand that Japan had no choice but to do so, and that Japan's legitimate attitude towards China and Manchuria should be understood, otherwise unfortunate events would occur and hinder world peace. All political party leaders now support the government's actions. Seiyukai President Suzuki said that after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, it must pursue an active diplomatic policy that asserts its own claims. Minseito President Wakatsuki said that the whole country should unite to fulfill its mission. Adachi, chairman of the Kokumin Domeikai, said that Japan should organize a League of Asia. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After sending the notification of withdrawal from the League of Nations, Foreign Minister Uchida made a statement to the press, saying that the process of the Japanese government's withdrawal from the League of Nations is now clear, and that any person in charge would have done the same. However, the situation from now on will not be so simple. First, the major issue of China is imminent, and its future cannot proceed as usual. We must have the cooperation of the entire nation, especially the support of the press. (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding Japan's position vis-à-vis the League of Nations after the withdrawal, League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond interpreted the text of Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, and sent a reply that gave the impression that Japan would retain its rights and obligations for the next two years. However, the view of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is that the notification of withdrawal is a matter of substance rather than theory. Therefore, the effect of the withdrawal will occur immediately. However, the notification of withdrawal means political disengagement from the League of Nations. Therefore, Japan will only fulfill the formal obligation of contributing to expenses and will not comply with other obligations, but the obligation to comply with the Kellogg-Briand Pact remains unchanged. Therefore, Japan will not participate in the League Council but will only cooperate in peaceful endeavors that do not violate the above policy. (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi, who completed the Diet battle and signed the imperial rescript on withdrawal from the League of Nations, met with a Dentsu reporter with great urgency, first denying rumors of his resignation, and then speaking freely about the current situation, saying that the economic blockade theory is absolutely out of the question. He said in essence, "Although there are widespread rumors that I will resign, I do not care. I am carefully considering the reorganization of the tax system and finances for the future. However, it is difficult to raise taxes after all. The only thing that may be raised in 1934 is the postal rate. Some say that since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, other countries of the League of Nations will impose an economic blockade on Japan, but the world situation is not so easy. Even if there is an economic blockade, the one who will suffer will not be Japan, but foreign countries. Although the Diet is over, there are still many important tasks to be done, and I cannot go to Hayama for rest. This is a time when the whole country must unite and work hard."

<p>(Washington) In view of the statement issued today by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the resumption of US-Soviet relations may be delayed. Pittman stated that he believes that the Russian debt issue should be settled before recognition. He also said that he believes that recognition of Soviet Russia should be based on a trade agreement. A trade agreement must be concluded before diplomatic relations can be restored. He meant that it would be too hasty for the President to simply appoint an ambassador and have the Senate approve it. An understanding must be reached on the main points of the existing issues before diplomatic relations can be restored. It is now reported that President Roosevelt has completed his study of the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia and will probably submit a formal special message to Congress after the rural relief bill and the unemployment relief bill are passed.

<p>Japan Is Not Yet Qualified to Wage War Against the United States</p>
<p>And Uses the Purchase of American Goods to Win Over the United States</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Hull Receive Matsuoka on Friday</p>
<p>(New York) After the local World Telegram asked Japanese representative to the League of Nations Matsuoka Yosuke to frankly express his views on the interests of the United States and Japan in the Far East, Matsuoka published an article in that newspaper today, declaring that Japan's concern about the threat of the United States in the Far East is the same as the United States' concern about the Yellow Peril. However, Japan currently has no territory or fortresses in the American oceans, while the United States has territory in the Far Eastern oceans. Japan has never been a threat to American interests. Western people have always known that Japan is not yet qualified to wage war against the richest and safest country in the world. Matsuoka then made it clear that the Japanese were unable to believe that the United States had the other-regardingness that it often claimed in its Far Eastern interests, and that, on the whole, the Japanese were unable to agree that the United States' Far Eastern interests were based on maintaining the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. The purchasing power of the 450 million Chinese people envisioned by the Americans is a dream. Most of the Chinese people are poor and how can they buy huge amounts of American goods? On the contrary, Japan buys more American goods than all the other places in the Far East combined. He greatly denigrated China's ability, and again discussed the dignity of treaties and the attitude of the United States towards Japan's military actions in Manchuria, and again argued that it was extremely difficult for the Japanese to understand why the Americans attached so much importance to Japan's adherence to the letter of the treaties, while the Europeans could be relaxed. It is also difficult to understand why the Americans pay so much attention to the morality of Manchuria, even more than to Chicago. (Kuomin News Agency dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The local newspaper published a telegram received by Voroshilov from the Great Uli Red Army, in which the telegram declared the recent rumors of the rebellion of the Great Uli Red Army. According to reports, we learned that foreign newspapers published a message from a Japanese stating that the 55th Regiment of the Red Army in Great Uli had rebelled. There is no 55th Regiment here. The message is malicious incitement and rumor. Please convey to the person who created this message that we know the intention of this rumor, which is to deceive the people of the capitalist countries and say that the Soviet Union is weak, and its people are dissatisfied, so that it will be easier to prepare to attack the Soviet Union. There was a similar rumor in the Central East Road area in 1929, but the result was a failure. We are now even stronger, and they should remember that since the overthrow of the Tsar in 1917, we have been prepared to fight to the last drop of blood, so all rumors are useless.

<p>Testimony from Righteous Army Commander Zhao Dianliang</p>
<p>(Beiping) Righteous Army Commander Zhao Dianliang came to Beiping and spoke of the extreme cruelty of the Japanese in Shenyang since the outbreak of the Rehe War. They forcibly seize carts and conscript laborers. In every village in the countryside, they demand ten carts. Before the conscripted civilians and carts even set out, two men are handcuffed together. After departure, they are chained to the carts to prevent escape. The carts are filled with sandbags to shield the Japanese soldiers as they drive them to the front lines, resulting in a great number of carters dying. Their bodies are continuously transported to the South Manchurian Railway station in Shenyang, three corpses tied together, and notices are posted for families to claim them. There are very few Japanese troops in the city, only around 800. Fearing unrest in the rear, they display their strength with tanks. Police substations have each been reduced by eighty officers. Civilian firearms in Fushun, Tieling, Faku, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Liaoyang, and other counties have all been ordered to be surrendered. To protect their weapons, many people have joined the Righteous Army. Therefore, the authorities have recently become less strict about confiscating arms. Many members of the Jing'an Guerrilla Force have been deployed to the Rehe front lines, with over six hundred deserting en route. Furthermore, the Japanese army has been recruiting bandits from various regions and arresting loiterers in theaters and brothels. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fang Benren and Shao Hongji arrived in Tianjin this morning, and Fang arrived in Beiping this evening. Shao is scheduled to arrive in Beiping tomorrow. Fang stated that he has been ordered to go north with Supervisory Committee member Shao Hongji to investigate the case of Chairman Tang of Rehe abandoning his post and fleeing. Their mission is solely to investigate Tang's personal conduct, and nothing else. The investigation procedures will be discussed and implemented jointly with Shao after meeting with He Yingqin.

<p>(Nanjing) Deng Zhexi, representative of Feng Yuxiang, passed through Nanjing on his way north. According to him, Feng has always advocated resistance against Japan. Since the fall of Rehe, Zhangjiakou has been at the forefront of the resistance, and he is unwilling to leave Zhangjiakou at this time. Rumors that he will come to Nanjing soon are likely premature. Feng cabled Li Liejun, urging him to go north. Li replied on the 28th, saying that after meeting with the central authorities in Nanjing and discussing everything, a decision has been made and will be implemented in stages. He urged Feng to come to Nanjing immediately to discuss national affairs and salvage the critical situation. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi said that Commissioner Li Liejun's proposal in the Central Committee for political opening up is indeed a preliminary step towards promoting civil rights. It is in line with the spirit of developing a democracy and should be implemented during this democratic political process. The constitutional era is fast approaching, and it is necessary to transfer the entire national political power to the people, allowing them to enjoy the right to participate in government. The political opening up should coincide with the start of the constitutional era. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yang Yongtai, Wang Faqin, Wu Tiecheng, and others arrived in Nanjing on the 28th to pay their respects to Chiang. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Yongtai said that Chiang, upon returning to Nanjing from Baoding, had previously telegraphed Feng Yuxiang to meet in Nanjing to discuss national affairs. However, it is not yet certain whether Feng will come. Although there has been widespread support for Chiang to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Central Committee has not yet formally discussed the proposal. Regarding the issue of military unification, although Sun and Yu, two members of the committee, have proposed it, the Central Committee has not yet made a concrete decision. Military unification is an important issue during this period of resistance against Japan. However, it involves changes to the military system and is of great importance, requiring careful consideration and a decision by the Central Committee before it can be implemented. Chiang's trip to Baoding has been postponed as key matters in Nanjing have yet to be resolved. When I left Beiping on Sunday, the situation at the key passes of the Great Wall was tense, with a significant increase in enemy troops in the Gubeikou area, suggesting a possible invasion. The enemy is also pressing closer at Lengkou, but our forces are on high alert and will retaliate if attacked. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Central Committee member Wang Faqin passed through Xuzhou from Xinxiang on the evening of the 27th on his way to Nanjing. He told reporters that during this time of national crisis, the government and the people should cooperate and unite to resist the invasion. The Japanese寇 are pressing us harder, and there is no way out but resistance. The North China Office feels that Xinxiang is inconvenient and has decided to move north, choosing between Zhengding, Baoding, and Beiping. All Central Committee members have been dispatched to various locations to inspect and guide the people's anti-Japanese movement. He is going south to urge President Wang to return to his post soon and preside over the central government, so that resistance can have a sound government to plan major strategies. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Fang Juehui passed through Xuzhou from Jinan on the evening of the 27th on his way back to Nanjing. He said that Shen Honglie, commander of the Northeast Navy, had submitted his resignation, and he was specially dispatched by the Central Committee to Qingdao to persuade him to stay. Shen's resignation has now been withdrawn, and he is continuing to serve. Shandong Province, with half of its area bordering the sea and numerous ports, is of utmost importance for national defense during this period of Japanese invasion. Han Fuqu's troops and the naval squadrons are on high alert and heavily guarded, giving the Japanese no opportunity to cause trouble. Even the privately run drug stores operated by the Japanese in Jinan and Qingdao have been indirectly cracked down on by Chairman Han, making it impossible for them to continue operating. As a result, many Japanese expatriates have returned to their country. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the incident of the British Malayan Peninsula promulgating harsh regulations restricting the freedom of overseas Chinese to land, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission drafted an opinion last week, stating that the Malayan Peninsula was originally a free port and had not previously restricted the entry of overseas Chinese. Recently, the British Governor of Singapore suddenly promulgated harsh regulations, which, although nominally aimed at restricting expatriates of all countries, in reality affect the majority of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, causing various inconveniences to them. The Commission has drafted four measures to request the Foreign Ministry to negotiate with the British Ambassador. (28th Dispatch)</p>

He received a telegram from Nanjing yesterday stating that Wang's return to his post is no longer an issue, and Chiang will return to the north to oversee the situation after Wang returns to his post. Li Fuying said that he came to Beiping to report on defense matters to He, and now that it is done, he is returning to his defense area. If the Japanese puppet army invades again, our army will fight them to the death. Xiong Bin said that he came north to report on departmental affairs to He.

<p>Palace Museum Staff Question Yi Peiji</p>
<p>(Beiping) The third batch of Palace Museum antiquities began to be transported to the train station at 8:00 PM tonight. All Palace Museum staff had previously jointly questioned Director Yi Peiji on two points: (1) The Director previously said that only 3,000 boxes of Palace Museum antiquities would be moved, but the transportation continues. (2) The Director previously said that the livelihoods of all Palace Museum staff would not be affected. However, after all the antiquities are moved south, will the Palace Museum staff still have adequate job security? Yi Peiji specially convened a meeting of all staff and gave a speech, the gist of which was: It was originally decided to move 3,000 boxes of Palace Museum antiquities south. It was agreed with the foreign members of the Custodial Committee that the rest would be stored in Jiaominxiang. However, because Jiaominxiang is under Japanese control, it cannot be used for storage. Therefore, it has been decided to continue the move south. After the move, there will still be much work to be done at the Palace Museum, requiring many staff. In addition, staff will also be needed in the south after the antiquities are moved, approximately half. Most of you are from Beiping, so you will rotate to serve in the south every six months. The livelihoods of the staff will remain as before and will not be affected. (28th Dispatch)</p>

He is here to visit He and is determined to do what is beneficial to the country. During this period of severe national crisis, he will not fall into the enemy's trap. The previous gunfire in Tianjin was not in the concession, but was caused by the Japanese using foreign oil drums filled with explosives to blow up in the suburbs in an attempt to disrupt transportation. The Japanese are full of tricks, and we must be on high alert. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Changes to County Magistrates in Various Counties</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that Jiangsu, bordering the sea and the Yangtze River, is strategically important.

The province has been divided into thirteen districts, and administrative inspectorates will be provisionally established, each with a commissioner who will concurrently serve as the county magistrate of the county in which they are stationed.

<p>Soviet Representative Criticizes</p>
<h3 id="e53">British Disarmament Plan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Military Figures Only Reflect Europe</p>
<p>The Number of Japanese Standing Army Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>Russia’s Neighboring Countries Would Increase Military Strength</p>
<p>TASS, Geneva, 27th: Soviet representative Dovgalevsky delivered a lengthy speech in the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference today, sharply criticizing the disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. MacDonald believes that one of the characteristics of the British disarmament plan is that it contains specific figures for disarmament. On this point, Dovgalevsky pointed out that the Soviet Union had already listed specific and accurate figures in its first proposal for complete and universal disarmament and its second proposal for gradual proportional disarmament. Dovgalevsky believes that the British plan has two shortcomings: (1) More than fifty countries attended the Disarmament Conference, but the military figures cited by Britain only reflect European countries, and only a part of European countries. (2) The British Prime Minister did not explain the basis of the standard for his figures. Dovgalevsky said that the Soviet delegation should first declare that the Soviet Union is very willing to reduce the number of its standing army to below the level of the British plan, but it always requires that this proportion must be applied to all countries, without exception, whether in Europe or outside Europe. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also willing to make a large reduction in the quality of armaments according to the British plan. The Soviet Union believes that Britain should explain the basis of the standard for the disarmament figures it has set, and this standard should be used to stipulate the disarmament figures for countries not included in the plan. Regarding the number of standing troops of the Soviet Union’s Asian neighbors, such as Japan, the Soviet representative believes that it cannot be ignored, and the territory that can be armed by the country on the border should also be considered. In addition, the British plan stipulates that Norway’s standing army should be 50,000, but according to the Norwegian representative, this number exceeds the country’s existing military strength. Then the question is whether the Soviet Union’s western neighbors, that is, what the plan calls “all other European countries,” should be allowed to increase their armaments because of the British plan. Dovgalevsky also declared that the Soviet Union supports the principle of drastically reducing the length of military service, but believes that the implementation of this reduction should include all countries, including all colonies. Regarding the part on air force reduction, Dovgalevsky declared that the Soviet representative wants to know the basis of the calculations made in the British plan. The Soviet Union believes that air force reduction should be universal to all countries participating in the conference, which is an absolute necessity, especially since the Soviet Union’s neighbors, such as Japan’s air force, have recently established military aviation teams outside its borders. Dovgalevsky also criticized the part of the British plan that retains the allowance for air force bombing, believing that it must be changed to a complete abolition of bombing from the sky. Finally, regarding naval disarmament, Dovgalevsky explained that the Soviet Union did not participate in the Washington and London Naval Treaties, so it cannot be required to unconditionally obey such regulations. As for the principle of naval reduction proposed in the British plan, the Soviet Union believes that what should be considered is that it divides all countries into two levels, one that should maintain the current state of the navy, and one that should be allowed to increase it.</p>

<p>National Geneva Dispatch, 27th: The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference has now adjourned until April 27. Many representatives expressed the hope that the four major European powers will be able to reach some special understanding during this period based on the proposal made by British Prime Minister MacDonald. Before the adjournment, the General Committee had a resolution specifying that after Easter, the British proposal would be used as the basis for discussion. This proposal was made by British Foreign Secretary Simon, who stated that representatives should retain the right to propose modifications and additions. Also, before the representatives boarded their cars to return home, a majority of representatives stated that they hoped that Britain, France, Italy, and Germany could reach some understanding during the recess. If no understanding can be reached, some representatives advocate an indefinite recess, frankly admitting that the General Committee has failed. However, these people believe that the British proposal can be the basis for direct negotiations between the four countries and can achieve some agreement.</p>

<p>Organization Dissolved, Over a Thousand Arrested</p>
<p>National News, Brunswick, 28th - Last night, the Brunswick Steel Helmet League organization was forcibly dissolved, members disarmed, and 1,350 people arrested, causing great shock among the populace. According to a public statement by Class, National Socialist member and Brunswick State Interior Minister, in recent days, a significant number of Social Democrats and Communists had joined the Steel Helmet League. Moega, leader of the Brunswick Steel Helmet League, acknowledged that members of the disbanded Republican Flag League and other Republican groups had been flocking to the Steel Helmet League headquarters to register, and armed Steel Helmet League members, belonging to the auxiliary police, were providing protection along the way, shouting their unit's battle cry. Last night, regular police, acting on orders from the Brunswick State government and assisted by National Socialist stormtroopers, searched for Steel Helmet League members who had joined the auxiliary police and surrounded the Steel Helmet League's office where a meeting was in progress, arresting 200 Steel Helmet League members and 1,150 Social Democrats and Communists inside, including several leaders of the Steel Helmet League and the Republican Flag League. During the encirclement, several auxiliary police members belonging to the Steel Helmet League reportedly destroyed their rifles.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 28th - Labor Minister and Steel Helmet League leader Serld has begun a thorough investigation of the Brunswick State government's handling of the Steel Helmet League case. Today, Seton met with National Socialist cabinet member Goering for a long discussion and also met with Interior Minister Dr. Frick. It is rumored that Steel Helmet League leaders will issue a statement today, which, according to key figures in the League, will differ greatly from the Brunswick State Interior Minister's account. The Brunswick State government is now in a difficult position, as it is unsure how to handle such a large number of arrestees, as individual trials would take a very long time.</p>

<p>Offers Five Suggestions for Resisting Japan</p>
<p>After Feng Yuxiang retired to Zhangjiakou, Chairman Chiang sent Ma Boyuan to Zhang to discuss everything and urged Feng to come to Nanjing. Feng expressed his willingness and replied to Chiang with a letter offering five suggestions for resisting Japan. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Elder Brother Kai-shek, Upon receiving your telegram and Ma Boyuan's visit to Zhang, I am deeply moved by your kindness. The country is in peril, and only sincere unity and concerted efforts to seek solutions can save us. I, Xiang, share weal and woe, life and death with you, my brother, to complete the Northern Expedition. Our personal friendship remains as it was. Even if our opinions sometimes differ, they arise from a desire to create a new nation. Now, the national crisis deepens daily, and the enemy continues to advance. This is truly a time of greatest danger. We must strive to defend ourselves and resist desperately to avert destruction. I have several points to present to you: (1) Rumors of compromise are widespread at home and abroad. These are certainly created by the enemy. However, our way to dispel these rumors must be through factual counter-evidence, then the rumors will cease naturally. Please pay attention to this. (2) Quickly dispatch elite troops from all sides, so that resistance is not limited to one corner. I especially hope that you, my brother, will personally lead one hundred thousand troops to recover lost territory. I will do my utmost to assist. (3) The troops fighting hard against the enemy at the front are extremely short of supplies and ammunition. Please find a way to replenish them. (4) The anti-Japanese armies and militias have suffered heavy casualties. Please find a way to provide relief and replenishment. (5) Politics is the foundation of everything. I especially hope that the government will reform and start anew with the people. The above five points are my humble suggestions. I hope you will adopt them. For anything unsaid, please ask Comrade Xiwen to convey it in person. Sincerely, Younger Brother Feng Yuxiang."</p>

<p>Completed Troop Rotation with a Certain Unit</p>
<p>His Troops Still on the Front Line</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: He Zhuguo, who commands troops stationed in Ledong, received an order from the Military Council on the 17th to rotate troops with the XX unit. He's unit had gradually concentrated by the previous day (24th). Chairman Chiang and Minister He, in order to understand the recent situation in Ledong, specially telegraphed and summoned He to Ping. General He left Lixian by special train at 6 PM the previous night, passed through Tianjin that night, and met with Chairman Yu Xuezhong to discuss matters of joint defense. He arrived in Ping at 8 AM yesterday (25th) and went to Jurentang at 7 PM that evening to meet with Minister He to report on the troop rotation in Ledong. Originally intending to visit Chiang in Baoding, he found Chiang had already left, so he scheduled to return to his defense zone at 6 PM today (26th). According to a statement made by He:</p>
<h3 id="e59">Strategic Relations <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jehol Incident, the Japanese army has been using threatening tactics against various parts of Ledong. On one hand, they increased troops in Yuguan and attacked nearby ports, and on the other hand, they deployed a large number of warships and anchored in Qinhuangdao to exert pressure by land and sea. The highest military authorities, considering that our army's garrison in Linyu had become a militarily exposed situation, ordered a troop rotation on the 17th of this month for strategic reasons, to be filled by troops stationed in a certain unit's position. Extremely solid trenches have been built on the Shi River and nearby front lines. The troops currently rotating have also arrived. There has been much speculation about our unit from the outside, but it is all talk without knowing the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Still on the Front Line <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Yuguan has been under the enemy's covetous eyes, with danger at every turn. I have been stationed in Yuguan for a year and three months. During this period, the Japanese army's conspiracies and attempts to invade have been more than one or two days. On January 1st, the enemy launched a large-scale land, sea, and air offensive, and our army retreated to the west bank of the Shi River. In these several months, we resisted the enemy, deeply desiring to sacrifice everything, but lacking orders. Since then, although our troops have been in Lixian, they are still on the front line. If the enemy invades, we swear to fight with the entire army.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Attack Six Ports <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army invading Jehol, according to investigations, totals over 50,000, including a mixed force of Zhang Haipeng and other puppet troops, totaling about 100,000. In addition, the Yiyuan Kou and Jiumen Kou areas have the puppet "National Anti-Japanese Salvation Army" organized by Ding Qiang. The Japanese army's plan is to attack our six ports, namely Shanhaiguan, Jiumenkou, Jielingkou, Xifengkou, and Gubeikou. Currently, some have already been occupied by the Japanese army, and some are facing off. The Japanese steps to invade us are: (1) Shanhaiguan uses the Boxer Protocol as an excuse, but destroys the treaty and forcibly occupies our Yuguan land. (2) For Jehol, it occupies our Jehol province based on the unilaterally signed Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. (3) It uses the "Anti-Japanese Salvation Army" organized by puppet troops to harass our Yiyuan Kou, attempting to disrupt the interior. Currently, the Japanese army is not actively preparing for a military offensive on Ledong because the Japanese warships previously in the Qinhuangdao sea have gradually left, and there are only 300-400 garrison troops in Yuguan city.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Front Line Situation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Fangling Kou and Jieling Kou definitely had fierce battles yesterday. Commander Shang has personally gone to the front to supervise the battle. The enemy troops attacking Leng Kou are the 10th Division and part of the 14th Division's Hiraga Brigade, totaling about 3,000. Yesterday, they used extremely fierce artillery fire to press against us, but were all repelled by Huang's troops. There were also battles at Jieling Kou, where Miao's entire division is responsible for that line. The battle on the Yiyuan Kou side seems to have passed. Recently, the enemy army transferred the puppet troops of Zhang Haipeng and Yu Zhishan to the Daling River Bridge, where they were suddenly disarmed by the Japanese army. The Japanese army has always considered the various puppet troops to be unreliable, and the puppet army generals, suffering this unexpected blow, all plan to hang the Blue Sky White Sun flag and are unwilling to submit to the Japanese army.

<h3 id="e63">Iron Army Requests to Fight Against Japan <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Sends Special Telegram to Nanjing Vowing to Sacrifice Lives to Repay the Country</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Present Flags and Swords as Encouragement</p>
<p>Beijing News: Wu Qiwai, commander of the Army's Fourth Army, has recently led his troops in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi and has repeatedly achieved remarkable feats. The army is known as the Iron Army for its loyalty, bravery, and skill in battle. At this time of growing national crisis and rising calls for resistance, the army's situation is of great concern to the people. When the wind is strong, one thinks of brave warriors. It is the fervent desire of the people that this Iron Army, a powerful force, will be seen on the battlefields of the north and south fighting the enemy bravely and venting the anger of the nation. Since General Zhang Fakui went abroad for inspection, Wu Qiwai has taken over as commander. Although the unit has been through many battles and suffered many casualties, its strict training and strong combat capabilities remain the same. The Central Government previously transferred the army to Jiangxi to suppress bandits. From the end of last year to January of this year, the army fought fiercely with the main force of Zhu Mao and other bandits in the Le'an area for ten days, especially in the battle of Fengshanpu, which was the most intense. In the end, the bandits were defeated, and the army was approved by the Central Government to accept the surrender of a division of communist bandits led by Guo, which was a great achievement. Chairman Chiang once sent a commendation. Recently, Wu was appointed as commander of the Second Column, commanding the XX Division, XX Division, XX Division, and XXXX Division, and captured Guangchang County earlier this month, and is now advancing south, directly attacking the bandit army's nest. It is recently heard that all officers and soldiers of the army, in response to the loss of Yu and Rehe, telegraphed to request to go north to participate in the war against Japan and vow to sacrifice their lives to repay the country. It is unknown whether this request will be approved. Furthermore, overseas Chinese have always admired the army. The Boston branch of the KMT in the United States sent a letter of encouragement and presented General Wu with a command sword and a large flag. The original letter is recorded below: "To Iron Army Commander Comrade Qiwai, commanders of divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, companies, platoons, and all soldiers, Greetings! For the past ten years, your army has traveled throughout the Central Plains to protect the Party and save the country, enduring hardship and danger. Your heroic deeds have been admired. Even last year's request to go to Shanghai to fight against Japan, although unrealized, we believe the people understand the bitterness of not being able to reach the front lines. We, overseas, wholeheartedly support your army's efforts and greatly value your efforts to save the country and protect the party. Therefore, to do our part, we have purchased 5,000 steel helmets and distributed them to the soldiers of your army. Now, we present a command sword and a large flag, and entrusted Comrade Yu Junxia, former standing committee member of our branch, to personally bring them back and present them to your army. The command sword is presented to your commander for use in directing the killing of enemies, and the large flag is left as a memento for your army. We still hope that you will continue to work hard with the spirit of the past, unite against foreign enemies, and fight to the end. We must recover lost territory, restore our sovereignty, rescue the people from misery, and bring wealth and strength to the country. These are the heartfelt wishes of our branch. Sincerely wishing you victory, The Chinese Nationalist Party's Boston Branch in the United States, Standing Committee Member Huang Qike, Chen Dunhong, Chicken Building Manager Yu Xue Li, Manager Yu Li Kun, February 14"</p>

<p>Last night (27th) at around 12:00 AM, seven or eight robbers speaking a local dialect suddenly came to Shi Xiunan's home in Dong Yaojia Bang, 43 Bao, 6 Xuan, north of Xiuye Bridge in the western suburbs. They were armed with pistols and daggers and forced the owner to reveal the location of his silver. Shi said he was poor and had nothing to give, so the robbers stabbed Shi Shaolan in the right hand and Shao Liang in the back of the right hand, robbed cotton quilts, clothes, and 2,000 cash. Afterwards, they went to the nearby home of Shi Shaoshan and robbed them of cotton quilts, clothes, and a pair of gold earrings, and stabbed Shi Shaochang in the right foot before leaving with a whoop.</p>

<p>Wang Xifang, the younger brother of Wang Xijin, manager of the Beitang Gongji Yarn Company, seduced Zhao Yunyu, a young girl, in mid-August of last year and incited her to flee to Shanghai. However, Yunyu was only eighteen years old, which led to her illness due to the seduction. Moreover, being together in a foreign land was not a long-term solution, so they secretly returned to Wuxi together. The girl's sister arrested Wang Xifang and transferred him to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and detention. As a result, Wang Xifang was prosecuted for indecent assault of a girl under the age of sixteen. Judge Wang held several hearings, and after the debate, the verdict was announced yesterday: Wang Xifang was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and ordered to compensate the plaintiff's private claim of thirty yuan.</p>

<p>A male corpse with numerous knife wounds to the head was recently discovered by the roadside near the east gate of Shaoxing. It appeared to be a case of murder. It was reported to the third public security sub-bureau, which sent personnel to investigate. It was learned that the case was actually an act of adultery between an uncle and his sister-in-law to murder her husband. Xu Ayou, a resident of the area, committed adultery with his sister-in-law, Xu Zhang, which was discovered by his brother, Xu Zhengfa. Fearing retaliation, he took the initiative and murdered him, moving the body to the wilderness, claiming that he was killed by bandits to conceal the truth from outsiders. Later, the public security bureau searched his home and found blood-stained cotton quilts and other evidence. The case was revealed, and the adulterer and adulteress have been transferred to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Temporary General Assembly of the Local Association</p>
<p>Driven by Conscience, Not to Show Off Merit</p>
<p>Battling Hunger and Cold, Not Disgracing the Mission</p>
<p>| I Hope So, Everyone Hopes So |</p>
<p>Shanghai Shishi Telegraph Agency Local News: Zhu Ziqiao was commissioned by the Local Association last year to lead various volunteer forces in the war of resistance against Japan. However, most of his troops lacked clothing and food, and fought in hunger and cold, so he withdrew to Shanghai to report to the association and seek relief. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, the association convened a special temporary meeting, inviting Zhu to report on his combat experiences. The circumstances at that time are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e71">Attendees <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, members of the association arrived continuously. Attendees included Zhu Ziqiao, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiluo, Wen Lantao, Kui Yanfang, Huang Renzhi and more than fifty other people.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Agenda <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>At 6:30 PM, the meeting was convened with the ringing of a bell, chaired by Shi Liangcai. The agenda was as follows: (1) Report of Zhu Ziqiao relaying a telegram from Commander Song Zheyuan, thanking the association for their condolences. (2) Report of a telegram from Commander Sun Dianying, thanking the association for their condolences. (3) Report of letters from the North, detailing recent conditions. (4) Zhu Ziqiao, together with Cha Mianzhong, came to the meeting from Beiping to report on the latest combat situation in the North and the handling of relief efforts. (5) Li Liejun's telegram requesting all efforts to assist anti-Japanese soldiers. (6) Report of a letter from Sun Zheyuan's representative, Sun Longqing, requesting that future donations be sent directly to the Bank of China and the Jin Cheng Bank for collection and remittance, and that the current needs are heavy-duty vehicles and cotton overcoats. (7) Discussion of methods to deal with the relief problem in the North. (8) Report of Li Du's representative Liu Piguang, Ma Zhanshan's representative Wu Huanzhang, and five representatives of returning soldiers from Jilin and Heilongjiang, Song Yunzhang, Liang Detang, Zhao Zhuohua, Zhao Shenyuan, and Zhang Chuyu, who came to the meeting to thank the association, request to be rapidly established a solution. (9) The Shanghai Charity Group's United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees wrote that 158 women and children from Wang Delin's troops have returned to Shanghai, but only 8 have homes to live in, and the rest will have to stay in Shanghai for a long time, requesting a meeting of various groups to discuss solutions. (10) The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association sent a letter requesting the citizens to encourage and establish a wartime organization (resolved to be turned over to the board of directors for discussion). (11) The Merchant National Salvation Association sent a letter describing the visit of representatives to Yuguan for condolences, and requesting assistance in providing materials for building defensive positions, with an attached list of soldiers killed and wounded (resolved to be included in the relief case).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Combat Experience <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>General Zhu Ziqiao reported on his combat experience, saying that in March of last year, from the standpoint of the people and under the mandate of the association, he automatically went north to work. He is now reporting in order to make the patriotic compatriots of the whole country strive to save the loss of the Northeast and to understand the importance of the Northeast. The local people in the Northeast were extremely delighted to see our group going to help. Especially the various groups in Shanghai, which have transferred their spirit of assisting the Nineteenth Route Army in combat to assisting the Northeast, were especially delightful. If the rear can provide further assistance, the volunteer army, which automatically fights for the survival of the country, will surely show even more fighting spirit. The important tasks of the volunteer army in the past, apart from bloody hand-to-hand combat, are to destroy railways to cut off their supplies, and to cut down utility poles to block their news. In the past year, we have made them suffer countless losses. Although the Japanese army's equipment is sophisticated, if we can persevere, victory will surely belong to us. Our stance is to hold on to the determination that we cannot be puppets, and we cannot be slaves to a fallen nation, and we must resist to the end no matter what. However, those fighting on the front lines have no food, no clothing, and face difficulties in transportation. As a result, the troops fighting on the front lines often go without a full meal for one or two days, and some have not changed their underwear for three months. The dire circumstances cannot be described in full. At the same time, on the relief front, the front lines are very far from the rear. The nearest is also seventy or eighty miles away. Rescuers lack automobiles, so they all use manpower, and it takes five or six people to carry one wounded soldier to the rear. Even if there are cars, there is no gasoline. Wood and hospital beds are also extremely scarce. Cotton quilts and clothing are transported day and night, and those who arrive later sleep on the ground. All kinds of tragic scenes are hard to describe. In short, the relief effort is urgently needed, and I hope that the compatriots in the rear will quickly find a way to avoid leaving wounded soldiers from the front without help. My reason for doing this is purely driven by conscience. Today's report has no purpose of showing off merit. If I am like this, I hope that everyone can be like this, then China's future will have hope.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Relief Measures <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Shi Liangcai reported that the previously raised 500,000 yuan had generally achieved its purpose, but the silver industry had only raised one-quarter (50,000 yuan), and requested that those present do their best to find a way. He also said that what the front lines lack most is thermos bottles, which should be procured in large numbers. At the same time, two methods were proposed: (1) encourage Zhang Xueliang to donate some, (2) the football community is very enthusiastic about national affairs, so please initiate a charity match. The first point was resolved to be delayed for the time being, and the second point was immediately prepared by the Progressive Association. Regarding the ninth item on the agenda, it was resolved to reply to the Shanghai Charity Group's United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees that they could find a way to borrow houses, but for finances, please seek to raise funds separately. The meeting was adjourned at over 8 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Impact of Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Must Still Fulfill All Obligations for Two Years</p>
<p>Conflicts May Arise Among Britain, America, and Germany Over the Governing of Islands</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Japan formally announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations the day before yesterday. A Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to diplomat Wu Chao-shu this morning to inquire about the international impact of Japan's withdrawal. Mr. Wu graciously received the reporter and provided a detailed response as follows:</p>
<p>Manifestation of a Mad Psychology According to Mr. Wu, although Japan announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations the day before yesterday, it cannot officially withdraw until March 27, 1935, according to the League of Nations Covenant. During these two years, Japan must still fulfill all the obligations of a member state of the League of Nations. This is like renting a house in Shanghai, where one must give a month's notice before terminating the lease. Only after a month has passed can the lease be terminated. Japan, angered by the League of Nations' upholding of justice, has withdrawn in an attempt to inflict a minor blow on the League. However, during these two years, Japan will still be bound by international covenants and must fulfill its obligations as a member state. Therefore, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations is actually harmful and not beneficial. However, Japan, knowing that it is harmful and not beneficial, still announced its withdrawal to vent its momentary anger. From this, we can also see a glimpse of the Japanese people's mad psychology. As for the first impact of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, it will be to strengthen the world's opinion that is unfavorable to Japan. The second impact will be the conflict arising from the mandated islands.</p>
<p>Conflict Among Britain, America, Germany, and Japan Japan announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations but still wants to retain the South Pacific mandated islands, which is bound to cause conflict with the League of Nations. Moreover, if Japan wants to retain the South Pacific mandated islands, Britain, America, and Germany all have the possibility of direct conflict with Japan. This is because British Australia is adjacent to the South Pacific mandated islands, and Britain is unwilling to have ambitious Japan govern the South Pacific islands. The United States, due to various military and commercial reasons, will also strongly oppose Japan retaining the South Pacific mandated islands. Germany is the former owner of the South Pacific islands and will certainly request their return, canceling Japan's trusteeship. Therefore, the South Pacific mandated island issue will not only cause conflict between Japan and the League of Nations, but Britain, America, and Germany all have the possibility of direct conflict with Japan. This great global upheaval will be triggered by this.</p>
<p>Ambassador Chiang Will Not Return to His Post Temporarily Regarding the Northeast issue, there is currently no possibility of direct negotiations between China and Japan. As for whether the League of Nations can sanction Japan, it still depends on whether Britain, America, and France have the determination to do so. Currently, the diplomatic focus of China and Japan is in Geneva, and the military focus is along the Great Wall. The ambassador to Japan feels that there is nothing to do, so Ambassador Chiang has decided not to return to his post temporarily.</p>

<p>Today's Commemoration</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>City Party Headquarters Holds Grand Meeting</p>
<p>Half-Mast Flags and Suspension of Entertainment</p>
<p>All Agencies Operate as Usual</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound. The City Party Headquarters is convening a meeting of all sectors to commemorate the event. The entire city will fly flags at half-mast and suspend entertainment. All agencies will operate as usual.</p>
<p>Commemoration Meeting The City Party Headquarters has scheduled a grand meeting of representatives from all sectors to commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound at 10:00 AM today in the grand auditorium on the third floor of the Party Headquarters on Lin Yin Road, West Gate. Standing Committee member Zhang Xingbai has been designated as the chairman of the meeting. All arrangements were completed last night, and a public announcement has been issued. (Omitted)</p>
<p>Agencies to Operate The City Party Headquarters issued a notice yesterday that all theaters and entertainment venues in the city should suspend entertainment, and all shops, companies, factories, and agencies should fly flags at half-mast to express condolences. All agencies under the City Government, as well as the Garrison Headquarters, Shanghai County Government, Seamen's Special Party Headquarters, and the Two-Roads Administration, have been ordered to operate as usual during this time of serious national crisis. However, the Local Court, through a public announcement by President Shen Xiqing and Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying yesterday, will be closed for one day today.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Statement Regarding Recent Activities <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Madam Soong Ching-ling issued a statement yesterday, saying that recently, various Chinese and Western newspapers have contained inaccurate reports about her personal activities. Madam Soong hereby lodges a solemn protest. One newspaper claimed that Madam Soong recently traveled to Hangzhou, which is completely false. The widespread report that Madam Soong went to Nanjing and resided in a self-owned villa is even more absurd. Madam Soong has not been to Beijing recently, nor has she owned a villa or any property in Beijing. Such reports may be spread by reactionaries. In fact, Madam Soong has been in Shanghai all along, handling the affairs of the China League for Civil Rights every day. Madam Soong wishes to state that any journalists who wish to know about her activities and work in Shanghai can write to her residence or inquire at the China League for Civil Rights. Spreading unfounded news seems unnecessary.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Re-Inspection of Inferior Goods Tomorrow <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Results to be Published in Newspapers</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association and the First District Branch of Citizens, considering that the area under their jurisdiction is the bustling center of Shanghai, should be particularly strict in automatically resisting inferior goods in order to maintain appearances and set an example. Therefore, they have organized an Inferior Goods Inspection Committee to conduct impartial inspections. Those who have truly been cleaned up have been issued joint certification plaques to ensure protection. However, the Association recently felt that the situation in North China was precarious. In addition to striving to solicit donations for national salvation and supporting the front lines, they believed that the fundamental way for merchants and residents to save the country was to resolutely engage in economic severance, which was the most important and effective measure. They were deeply concerned that unscrupulous merchants might still be mixed in with the Association's area, secretly selling inferior goods. Therefore, they decided at a meeting yesterday afternoon to convene the former inspectors again, starting at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 30th), to set off in groups to conduct inspections. Regardless of whether they have received a plaque or are members, they must be inspected one by one, and the results will be published in advertisements in major Shanghai daily newspapers in order to reward or punish them in terms of reputation and to make it easier for patriotic compatriots to know what to choose when purchasing goods.</p>
<p>Representatives of Wang Delin's Family Members</p>
<h3 id="e86">Thanked Various Agencies Yesterday <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Hoping to Find Ways to Accommodate Family Members of Various Units</p>
<p>Newborn Child Named "Wu Yang," Containing a Double Meaning</p>
<p>Rosters Created to Await Discussion of Methods by All Sectors</p>
<p>After the family members of General Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin National Salvation Army, and others arrived in Shanghai, they temporarily stayed at the Shanghai Grand Hotel. Wu Huanzhang and other representatives of the Northeast Armies specifically sought assistance from all sectors yesterday and have created rosters to send to various organizations. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Expressing Gratitude to All Sectors <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Song Yunzhang, Zhao Shenyuan, Liang Detang, Zhang Chuyu, and other representatives of the unit, together with personnel from the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies, such as Wu Huanzhang, representative of Ma Zhanshan, Liu Piguang, representative of Li Du, Zhao Zhuohua, representative of Feng Zhanhai, and other seven people, visited the Municipal Government, Municipal Public Security Bureau, Local Association, Northeast Association, Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, various charitable organizations, the United Association for Relief of Northeast Refugees, the Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeast Compatriots, and other organizations yesterday to express their gratitude for the enthusiasm of all sectors in caring for the unit's arrival in Shanghai. Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen, Local Promotion Association President Shi Liangcai, and others personally received them and expressed their willingness to do their best to help with the aftermath of the unit's family members.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Long-Term Plans Should Be Considered <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to Liang Detang, the Shanghai representative of Commander Wang Delin, after the family members of our unit came to Shanghai, they were given food and lodging by various organizations and were warmly received, and the cost of meals and accommodation was paid on their behalf. We are deeply grateful for the thoughtful care. However, we believe that paying around 100 yuan per day for meals and accommodation at a Shanghai hotel is not a long-term plan. In the future, other Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies, such as those of Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Li Du, and Feng Zhanhai, may continue to send their family members to Shanghai in order to eliminate any worries about the rear. Therefore, in order to seek a once-and-for-all solution, it seems that a more spacious location should be found so that the family members of the anti-Japanese soldiers can have a place to settle down. Then the anti-Japanese soldiers will have no family burden and can concentrate on fighting the enemy for the country. When we went to various agencies and organizations to express our gratitude today, we expressed this intention to all sectors.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Petitioning the Central Government <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>As for this once-and-for-all plan, it seems that it should be organized and handled by the government authorities and supported by local organizations. The care given to the family members of our unit by various sectors this time has already cost a lot, and the mutual assistance between the people has reached its limit. If the Central Government can accommodate the family members of the anti-Japanese soldiers as much as possible, then the soldiers will be able to serve with peace of mind, which is tantamount to encouraging the soldiers, and its effect is equal to providing relief. Therefore, we may unite the representatives of various units stationed in Shanghai and go to Beijing to petition the Central Government.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Child Named Wu Yang <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Liang also said that after the family members of the unit arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, the boy born to the wife of Adjutant Wang Wujiang within half an hour was named "Wu Yang" after mutual consultation by all the family members. This contains a double meaning: one is to express the safe birth after arriving in Shanghai on the Wu Yang Wheel, and the other is to hope that our four northeastern provinces can return safely and be restored to our country's territory.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Detailed Rosters <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Detailed rosters of the unit's family members, which were previously requested by the United Association of Charitable Organizations, were created yesterday and sent to the United Association of Organizations for transcription and forwarding to the Local Association to discuss specific methods for settling the unit's family members.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Letter Requesting Discussion <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The United Association of Charitable Organizations of this city sent a letter to the Local Association yesterday, saying: "Respectfully, we received a previous letter stating that according to the telegram from Liang Yuanshanqiao, representative of Wang Delin, Commander of the National Salvation Army, Wang's unit's military women and children entered Russia and returned to China, and the remaining 158 family members went directly to Shanghai, requesting assistance. Now, the family members have arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and are staying at the Shanghai Tai Hotel in Baoyu Lane, French Concession. According to reports from Chen Wenkui and Ge Yunxun, the staff members sent by our association to receive them, only eight of these family members have homes to return to, and the rest are all from the three northeastern provinces. Their husbands are all on the front lines and must stay in Shanghai for a long time. The daily expenses are huge and difficult to sustain. Accordingly, we are writing to your association to convene a meeting of various organizations to discuss a long-term maintenance plan. We are very hopeful. Sincerely, to the Shanghai Local Association."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Women's Condolences <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>In addition to sending representatives to welcome them at the port, the Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Northeast Compatriots also sent representatives Huang Shaoxiong's wife Cai Fengzhen, Wu Tiecheng's wife Shen Huiru, Ma Chaojun's wife Shen Huilian, Gan Naiguang's wife Chen Xingrong, He Xiangning's representative Zhang Qiong, and Ms. Wei Qiongying and Liang Deyi to express their condolences. The association had originally prepared to provide relief in the form of money and goods, but Madam Wang indicated that those who came to Shanghai this time were only the family members of Wang's unit. During this time of national crisis, they only hoped to be able to live. What they most hoped for was to provide the front lines with shells and food so that they could destroy the enemy. They also said that General Wang would also arrive in Shanghai next month. The meeting decided to provide them with concrete assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Initiating a Tuberculosis Prevention Association <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Supports and Promotes</p>
<p>The health authorities of this city have recently launched a movement to initiate the organization of a Tuberculosis Prevention Association. It is heard that the motivation for this movement came from Dr. Bu Mei, a Cantonese and director of the Department of Cardiology and Pulmonary Medicine at the Red Cross Hospital last year. He noted that the number of citizens in this city suffering from tuberculosis has been increasing year by year, and tuberculosis is easy to spread, and those who suffer from this disease will suffer health damage at minimum and loss of life at worst. The movement was launched so that we must urgently seek preventive measures. Therefore, there was a discussion about organizing a Tuberculosis Prevention Association. Dr. Bu Mei had repeated consultations with Mr. Li Tingan, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, and Mr. Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Epidemic Prevention Office. Recently, the draft of the opinion letter has been completed. The content of the opinion letter is divided and described below.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Feng Yuxiang's Letter to Ninety-Four Elder <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Agrees with the Intolerable Association</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang, who is rumored to be going to Beijing to jointly face the national crisis, sent a letter to Ninety-Four Elder Ma Xiangbo yesterday, saying: "Elder Ma, I am honored to hear of your well-being. This time, the Japanese army is invading Rehe and planning to disturb North China. If our country does not strive to save itself, the danger of partition and joint administration may come sooner than we expect. Therefore, the way to save the country should be to seek it from the people as the most urgent task at present. The elder initiated the Intolerable Association to advocate for the world, and it will surely awaken the deaf and inspire the foolish, making the cowardly stand up and the timid be brave, restoring the national spirit and a lasting struggle with the Japanese bandits. I am far away in the northern border and cannot help but offer my advance congratulations. I am very impressed that Father Lebbe, as a foreigner, is so enthusiastic and righteous. The front line is tense these days, and rescue work is very important. I will try to do what you and the other gentlemen have hoped for. I am concerned about your health, so I am writing to inform you first. Sincerely, I respectfully wish you blessings and peace. Your student Feng Yuxiang bows."</p>
<p>Promotion Method Before the establishment of the association, it will first publicly solicit members who support this work. People of all nationalities and genders can join the association to promote it universally. The association plans to unite the Shanghai Chinese Medical Association, the Public Health Committee, the Shanghai Public Health Association, and other medical groups to jointly develop epidemic prevention affairs, and to invite well-known groups in this city, such as the Young Men's and Women's Christian Associations, the Orphanage, the Shanghai Race Club, the Youth Society, the Red Cross Society, the Rotary Club, the Health Department of the International League of Nations, and various university clubs, to participate and share the responsibility of prevention.</p>
<p>Soliciting Members In the future, for the matter of soliciting members, it is planned to first appoint Mayor Wu Tiecheng, major philanthropists, leaders of various organizations, famous ladies, and celebrities in the medical field to serve as sponsors and promoters, and then separately solicit members. Members are divided into four groups: (1) Supporting members, who pay an annual membership fee of 100 yuan; (2) Maintaining members, who pay an annual membership fee of 25 yuan; (3) Ordinary members, who pay an annual membership fee of 5 yuan; (4) Junior members, who pay an annual membership fee of 1 yuan.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Association Organization After the association is established, there will be one president, who will be Mayor Wu, four vice presidents (two men and two women), one honorary treasurer, and two honorary secretaries (one Chinese and one foreign). Various committees are also planned to be organized: (1) Standing Committee (organized by 30 members); (2) Finance Committee (organized by 10 members); (3) Soliciting Committee (organized by 5 members); (4) Medical Committee (organized by 5 members); (5) Executive Committee (organized by 5 people jointly recommended by the Finance and Medical Committees). The association should have one responsible director and several assistants to carry out the work.</p>
<p>Business Outline The association plans to set up (1) a clinic, (2) a tuberculosis hospital, and (3) a tuberculosis sanatorium, and pay attention to publicity. As for the organization of the various hospitals and sanatoriums, it is still under discussion.</p>
<p>All Sectors</p>
<h3 id="e96">National Aviation Salvation Movement <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association began soliciting, all sectors have enthusiastically participated and been very active. In terms of children, since Tang Mingyue and others initiated the organization of a fund-raising national salvation team, there have been frequent reports of saving candy money for aviation. In order to encourage this, the association is currently drafting organizational plans for the Children's Solicitation Team for National Aviation Salvation. In order to increase the public's awareness of aviation, aircraft performances and displays will be held. As for factories, they are also not lagging behind. For example, the workers of the Zhabei New Power Plant have donated their hard-earned wages to air defense, which is particularly commendable. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Children's Solicitation The children of Shanghai are very active in donating to national aviation salvation. Previously, eleven children, including Tang Mingyue, voluntarily organized a fund-raising national salvation team, drafted a declaration and regulations, and sent a letter to the Aviation Association for verification. Now, the Aviation Association, due to its responsibility, does not want to disappoint patriotic children, so it is drafting organizational plans and sending letters to the Education Bureau, ordering the principals of various primary and secondary schools to cooperate in handling the matter. The name is roughly the Children's Solicitation Team for National Aviation Salvation, and child members are limited to those aged ten to fifteen.</p>
<p>Aircraft Performance Huang Zaoxiong of the Shanghai Municipal Education Association and others will perform in Shanghai from today until the 8th, and will display them at Longhua Airport for public viewing. It is hoped that elementary school students throughout the city can visit to instill aviation knowledge and generate interest in the aviation industry. After receiving the letter, the Aviation Association has forwarded it to the Aviation Department for approval.</p>
<p>Factory Enthusiasm As for factories, they are also very enthusiastic. For example, the workers of the Zhabei Power Plant, after being informed of the great righteousness by the factory leaders Shao Wenqing and Chen, have all joined. Those with higher wages are special members or ordinary members, and those with lower wages also pool their resources and join as group members, with membership fees reaching 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Boy Scout Plane The Shanghai Boy Scout Council is in charge of soliciting donations for the Shanghai Boy Scout Plane project, which is currently in full swing. All boy scout troops in the city are actively participating in the solicitation, and the results are very good. In order to facilitate the payment of funds by various branch teams, Tong Xingbai, the captain of the solicitation committee, has negotiated with the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and all branches of the bank in the city have the authority to collect funds.</p>
<p>County Government Meeting The Shanghai County Government held a meeting yesterday to discuss methods for soliciting donations for aircraft and immediately established a collection and management committee and resolved the following: (1) Collection location: County Government; (2) Temporary deposit bank: Pu Hai Bank, to be withdrawn with the signatures of three committee members; (3) Deduction of salary donations from officials of various agencies to be submitted to this committee for remittance; (4) Organizing the Shanghai County Aircraft Donation Solicitation Team, appointing Yan Shenyu as the captain, Zhang Zuiling as the deputy captain, and Peng Liren as the chief of staff; (5) Organizing six sub-teams, appointing Wu Shifang as the captain of the first sub-team, Zhang Boliang as the deputy captain, Peng Zhaotang as the captain of the second sub-team, Kang Yongnian as the deputy captain, Sun Siben as the captain of the third sub-team, Zhang Yi as the deputy captain, Fu Dianying as the captain of the fourth sub-team, Huo Guiliang as the deputy captain, Xing Zhiyuan as the captain of the fifth sub-team, Ding Xiuming as the deputy captain, Wang Chengjing as the captain of the sixth sub-team, Yang Shunfan as the deputy captain. Yun Shu, Yu Yixin, Ding Renke, Shi Jinwang Huazhen, Jiang Shijie, Sun Shengzeng, Tang Zichun, Wang Guanyu, Li Jinhou, and Yin Shisheng are appointed as special team captains. The solicitation will begin on April 1st, with reports every half month.</p>
<p>Muslim Donations Team No. 114 of the National Aviation Salvation Solicitation Team undertaken by local Muslim organizations is progressing smoothly in its solicitation work. Recently, the organization has successfully contacted General Ma Liang, the upper general of the National Government Military Committee. Those who are willing to join as special members or supporting members, with a special membership fee of ten yuan and a supporting membership fee of fifty yuan, can receive a personally written calligraphy or horizontal inscription or couplet or a single character of longevity from General Ma. During the contact, one can go to Zheng Jingwu at No. 222 Qinglian Street, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, or Ma Xingdong at No. 2 Continental Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, or lawyer Ma Zhongnan at No. 301 Avenue Joffre. It is also heard that Muslim donations have now reached more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Merchant Plane Zheng Zenan, an executive committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying: "Respectfully, our association plans to donate to purchase Shanghai Merchant No. 1 aircraft and entrust the solicitation of donations. I have already solicited 5,060 yuan. I am now submitting the amount, along with a list of the donor's names. I hope you will receive it." It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has verified and issued a receipt.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Zhu Jiqing's Telegram <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for the Fall of Rehe</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, the Director-General of the Northeast National Salvation Army, sent a telegram to a certain Central Committee member in Nanjing from the front line on the 23rd of this month, the original text of which is as follows: (Omitted above) (2) This time, the Japanese army invaded Rehe. The troops in Chaoyang were less than 2,000, and those in Kairu on the left wing and Lingnan on the right wing were also less than 1,000. Even with the puppet army, the total number was less than 20,000. We had hundreds of thousands of troops, but we were defeated in one battle. Rehe was lost in less than ten days. Moreover, the enemy had a thorough understanding of our military situation, but we knew nothing about the enemy's movements. Our actions were slow and our responses were ineffective, while the enemy tried to be swift and took us by surprise. They knew that the people of Rehe had a deep hatred for Tang [Yulin] and used guides. They knew that Shao Benliang had a grudge against the Dong brigade and sought to use them as vanguards. They also used news to exaggerate their propaganda and collected more than 3,000 large vehicles loaded with sandbags and a small number of Japanese troops to bolster their momentum and cover up their intentions. Our army did not notice and was demoralized before the battle. (3) Many officers lacked national consciousness and a sense of the country. In this kind of national war, they still focused on preserving their strength and were accustomed to leisure. Not only did they have no combat plans, but they did not pay attention to the war. For example, when the enemy reached Lingyuan, [name omitted] was still eating peacefully. The 19th Brigade was ordered to change defenses, but before the 1st Brigade that was supposed to take over arrived at the position, they retreated first. The enemy took the opportunity to attack and lost Lingnan. Chaoyang, as the gateway to Rehe, was entrusted to the Rehe army, which was unable to withstand a single blow. (4) In the past, the authorities imposed harsh policies and abused the people, causing widespread resentment. The ignorant people took the opportunity to complain and were willing to be accomplices to the enemy. (5) In peacetime, the army was not paid, and in wartime, the generals did not go to the front. The soldiers had no will to fight, and some even turned against each other. For example, Shao Benliang's attack on Chaoyang was a current fact. (6) All the armies were stationed more than 200 li away from the enemy, abandoning the natural defenses and not defending them, as if there was a predetermined plan to abandon Rehe. I do not know what their hearts and livers are made of. (7) All the armies that resisted the enemy adopted a strategy of only defending and not attacking, leading to a decline in morale. They also did not coordinate and fought separately, causing the enemy to break them individually. The above are the main reasons for the loss of Rehe. The number of invading Japanese troops was not large, and they have been fighting for more than a month, so their casualties should also be considerable. To this day, we have not seen a large number of reinforcements. The enemy's current strength in Rehe is very weak, and the river channels on all roads are about to thaw, and the armored vehicles on which the enemy relies have lost their power. If elite troops with combat experience can be selected, (omitted) then they can be wiped out in one fell swoop. I hope you will consider this carefully. (Omitted below) Zhu Jiqing kowtows.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Three Million Overseas Chinese in Thailand Will Forget Their Ancestral Country <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Siamese Government Implements Assimilation Policy</p>
<p>Forcing Chinese Children to Study Siamese</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Thailand Telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Negotiate</p>
<p>Recently, due to the weak means of the diplomatic authorities of the motherland, our overseas Chinese compatriots have been subjected to heavy oppression by the local governments of various countries. Japan refuses Chinese people from landing, the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia increase various taxes, and recently the Siamese government, in order to naturalize the three million overseas Chinese in Thailand as Siamese citizens, has formulated various acculturation policies, strictly implemented them, and revised immigration regulations and increased import and export taxes to show restrictions. The overseas Chinese in Thailand have telegraphed the diplomatic authorities, requesting negotiations to stop these measures. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Changing to Siamese Bookkeeping <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Our compatriots residing in Siam, according to official statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, number over three million. They mostly run food stalls and small businesses in various parts of Siam. Because the Siamese government levies extremely heavy taxes, their lives are quite difficult. All the accounting books for incoming and outgoing goods, as well as daily records of business income, must bear stamps issued by the Siamese government. However, the use of Chinese bookkeeping was permitted, and the Siamese government did not restrict it. Recently, however, in order to implement its assimilation plan, the Siamese government has strictly ordered Chinese shops in all locations to uniformly adopt Siamese bookkeeping for their accounts from now on. On the surface, this is said to facilitate inspection, but in reality, it is intended to gradually make overseas Chinese forget the writing of their motherland and to become naturalized Siamese citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Increasing Import and Export Taxes <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In addition to implementing the above-mentioned insidious plan, the Siamese government has also revised immigration conditions and increased the import tax on Chinese people to show restriction. The import tax for Chinese entering Siam used to be 40 baht, but it has now been increased to 100 baht (approximately equivalent to more than 160 Chinese yuan). Restrictions on Chinese children leaving the country are even stricter. In addition to paying a deposit of 500 baht, they must also submit a Siamese diploma; otherwise, they will not be allowed to leave the country. For adults, the export tax has also increased from 5 baht to 20 baht.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Strictly Ordering the Teaching of Siamese <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>As for schools founded by overseas Chinese in Siam, the position of principal must be filled by a Siamese person appointed by the Siamese government. All subjects are also standardized according to the educational regulations promulgated by the Siamese government, with Siamese as the basic course. Therefore, Siamese must be taught for at least 25 hours per week, while Chinese is only taught for one hour per day. Other languages such as English and Japanese are also considered more important than Chinese. The purpose is none other than to make Chinese children, when they grow up, only know Siamese and not Chinese. The viciousness of its assimilation policy is truly chilling. Overseas Chinese, being in a foreign land, have no way to resist and can only be slaughtered. I fear that in twenty years, these millions of overseas Chinese will no longer be part of our Chinese nation. I deeply hope that the government authorities will immediately find a way to lodge a strong protest with the Siamese government in order to open a lifeline for our overseas Chinese in Siam.</p>

<p>Mr. Liang Xiaochu, acting director-general of the Youth Association, went north the week before last to investigate the progress of the war and to solicit opinions from military and political authorities on the Youth Association's wartime service work. Mr. Liang has now returned to Shanghai on the 27th (Monday). According to his report, the front-line war situation is extremely tight, and military and political authorities have expressed an urgent need for the Youth Association to engage in educational, recreational, transportation, propaganda, and other war service activities. The Youth Association has now invited Mr. Quan Shaowen to be the director of the North China War Zone Service Department of the Youth Association, and last week sent Mr. Zhang Mingyong, Mr. Huo Bingheng, Mr. Qi Xinge, and Mr. Song Ruhai to the front line to establish two reception centers for lightly wounded soldiers. The Shanghai Youth Association has purchased six large balloons and other entertainment items to send to the front. It is said that the most needed items at the front are undershirts, dirty pants, socks, and towels for clothing, and preserved plums and beef jerky for food.</p>

All agencies sent representatives to meet them and promised to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Nanyang Tobacco Factory Dispute Tried Yesterday <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Confer</p>
<p>Special District Court Opens Trial</p>
<p>Trade Union Makes Some Clarifications</p>
<p>In the case of the labor-management dispute at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, the situation has become serious again because Wu Linkun, the legal counsel of the factory, arrested workers. Yesterday, party and government agencies conferred on the steps to mediate, the court tried the detained workers, and the trade union council made important remarks on the Nanyang Tobacco Factory's statement. Details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Party and Government Conference The party and government agencies believe that the internal investigation company refuses to withdraw, and even claims that the patrol room automatically sent the arrested workers, and the arrested workers have not been released. In order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Wang Xianqing, director of the mediation section, and the Party Department sent Zhang Sheng, a cadre of the civil training section, to the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss mediation steps.</p>
<p>Court Opens Trial In the labor unrest dispute at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, Zhang Desheng, the foreman of the tobacco leaf room, took the opportunity to use violent means, carrying weapons and inviting many people to arbitrarily destroy objects in the tin packaging department, and severely beat the staff members Li Zhitang, Li Chengyao, and Chen Ronggui, who worked in the engineering department, and sent them to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road, the Blue Cross Society on Haining Road, and other hospitals for treatment. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Patrol Room have successively arrested the culprit Zhang Desheng and the accomplices Wu Shiyuan, Li Ajin, Li Gui, and Li Xinfa and others, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the patrol room sent Zhang and other five people to the Third Criminal Court. The trial judge Xiao Xiefen and the chief prosecutor Wang Zuze attended the trial. The patrol room's lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the victims Li Zhitang and Li Chengyao in this case are seriously injured in Baolong Hospital on Baker Road. Wu Linkun, the legal counsel of the company, said that Li Zhitang's condition is critical, his brain is injured, thick blood is flowing out, or it will worsen, and his life is at stake. Therefore, he requested the court to go to the hospital with the prosecutor and the forensic doctor to examine his condition in order to clarify the truth. There are two other victims in this case, one is Zhou Gengsheng, and the other is Xu Shunqing, who are also workers in the factory. They were also affected at the time and were sent to Yueming Guangdong Hospital at No. 469 North Sichuan Road. The injuries are also severe. The patrol room sent people to investigate the hospital. According to the doctor, they need to be treated for two weeks before they can be discharged from the hospital. It is hoped that the court will also send a forensic doctor to examine the injuries of the two people. Because the crowd was chaotic at the time, it was impossible to find out. There are a total of four victims in the hospital in this case. Now only Chen Ronggui, who has recovered, is in court. This case cannot proceed, so please postpone it until all the victims have recovered. Then, lawyer Wu Linkun immediately stated the main points of the victims' injuries, saying that Li Zhitang's right skull was damaged, causing thick blood to flow out, and he was the most severely injured. Li Chengyao suffered head injuries and was in a coma. Zhou Gengsheng's head was swollen and his nose was also injured. Xu Shunqing's brain was injured. All of them were consulted by doctors. The rest of the requests were the same as those of lawyer Zhang from the patrol room. According to Chen Ronggui's testimony, his back and chest injuries have improved slightly, and he is helping in the company's engineering department, but not for long. He could not identify the faces of the defendants, and at that time, everyone was hitting each other with iron wooden sticks, etc. According to Zhang Sheng, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, Wu Shiyuan did come to report at 10:10 a.m. and went to the company with representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau and the General Labor Union to mediate and discuss solutions with lawyer Wu Linkun. When questioned, the defendants all denied participating in the beating of the staff, and hired lawyers Wu Shou Gong, Fan Gang, and Ling Qigan to request bail for trial. Judge Xiao ordered the two defendants Wu Shiyuan and Li Xinfa to pay a bail of 500 yuan each, and the rest were detained and re-examined on another day.</p>
<p>Trade Union's Statement Yesterday, Zhou Xuexiang, the executive director of the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Trade Union, told the reporter of the New Voice News Agency about the company's statement the day before yesterday that many of the contents of the statement published in the newspapers yesterday did not match the facts. He made the following clarifications: (1) The so-called statements made by the labor representatives are not the true intentions of all the workers. Only a very small number of bad elements collude with private individuals, engage in private fraud, fabricate all kinds of rumors, and accuse the company of oppressing workers. The office has submitted the application to the party and government agencies. It is a pure organization of all factory employees. The starting point for making statements is naturally in the name of the office, which is expected by the public. What is the so-called small number of bad elements fabricating rumors? As for the company oppressing workers, secretly reporting to the patrol room to arrest workers, and deploying investigators in the factory, the facts are all there, so there is no need to fabricate them. (2) Whether the company's losses are due to high wages or oppression by the trade union, the company's profits last year were not earned by the Shanghai factory alone, and the profits were due to the joint efforts of all employees. It goes without saying that the previous factory closure was due to the pressure of the trade union and wages. Now that the office has been established, it is feared that it will be detrimental to itself, so it deliberately sabotages it. As for the company's profits last year, it has been explained in the statement that it was the joint effort of all employees, and it cannot be achieved by one person. (3) Now the company has expelled the former chief engineer for embezzling the bonus of all workers after investigation, but the so-called worker representatives demand that the former chief engineer be reinstated. It is not necessary for the workers to advise the company on the appointment and dismissal of staff. Since the former chief engineer has been in office, he has been trying to reorganize the factory and has made outstanding achievements. The company dismissed him because he had not been to the factory for a long time, which is not appropriate. Therefore, it sent a letter to the company requesting it to be recorded. This is an expression of intention. As for the embezzlement of workers' bonuses, it is not known what the intention is. (4) During the strike a few days ago, workers and staff clashed. The patrol room arrested the troublemakers on the spot and sent them to the court for punishment. The witnesses on the scene testified in court to exercise their due rights. After the establishment of the office, it put forward preconditions and requested the company to recognize it. Not only did the company ignore it, but it also secretly instigated traitors to use salary increases and promotions as a slogan to implement means of alienation and sabotage of the workers' organization, which aroused the indignation of all workers and caused a voluntary strike. The director Zhang Desheng advised the workers on the spot to maintain order, and was arrested as a result. The false witnesses in court even falsely accused the director Wu Shiyuan of being one of the murderers. At the time of the strike, Wu Shiyuan was in the Municipal Party Department to discuss important matters. How could he have committed the murder? Whether the witnesses were hired and whether they were true or false can be proven by the Municipal Party Department. (5) The company has never prevented honest workers from joining the trade union, and has given detailed consideration and peaceful answers to the preconditions put forward. The company has never expressed its recognition of the office, that is, it does not prevent workers from joining the trade union, gives detailed consideration to the preconditions, and gives peaceful answers. This is a hypocritical high-sounding statement. (6) The legitimacy of the organization of the office must be inquired first. The office has submitted the application to the party and government agencies for organization and establishment, and the party and government authorities have recognized it as a legitimate organization. There is no need for the company to review whether it is legal or not. (7) It is said that since there was no consultation on the dismissal of the chief engineer by the factory, how could the office be hastily declared established the second day after the dismissal? The establishment of the office was reported to the party and government agencies in advance to send personnel to supervise the election. At this time, how could we know the company's conspiracy to dismiss the chief engineer? The claim that it was intentionally hastily established is self-defeating. As for their request to release the detained workers after the riot, it is also said that the company cannot do anything about it. Since there was no reason to stop the riot on the morning of the 19th, and many people were beaten and objects were destroyed, it should be dealt with according to law. After the strike, the party and government agencies sent people to persuade the workers to resume work. Wu Linkun, the representative of the factory, admitted that the company was responsible and released the innocent people that night. The arrested director Zhang Desheng is now claiming that the company cannot do anything about it. The intention of this kind of insidious deception can be known. The above-mentioned points are the true situation of the process, and the company conceals the facts, spreads fallacies, and confuses the public, which is very unfortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Promote the Meaning of Thrift <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Executive Committee has designated yesterday to the 3rd of next month as the Thrift Promotion Week, sending personnel to various districts every day to conduct expanded publicity, and issuing a letter to the public, outlining the important significance of the National Thrift Movement as follows: (1) Thrift is purely a kind of economic salvation movement with positive and striving functions, and it is by no means a passive act of stinginess, but rather actual hoarding. Its purpose is to save extravagance in the economic field, and to value time in the work field, strive to increase production, enrich national strength, and expand the power to resist insults. (3) Our front-line soldiers are currently fighting hard against Japan. The compatriots who live in the rear cannot only express gratitude and respect, but must also fulfill their responsibilities. We must know that we can still live and work in peace today, and avoid the trampling of Japanese bandits, thanks to the soldiers on the front line who endure hunger and hardship. Since we in the rear cannot all go to the front line to help resist the enemy, we should, in addition to being well-fed and clothed, consider the plight of the soldiers on the front line, save all expenses, and continuously provide relief to the hard-fought soldiers who are resisting the enemy, and relieve the compatriots who have suffered in the war zone, in order to express the spirit of sharing the same hatred and fulfilling the responsibility of mutual assistance among compatriots. (3) Thrift can not only save waste, but is also the only effective method of economic severance with Japan. All Japanese goods should be rejected and not purchased. All daily necessities that can be saved should also be saved as much as possible. If there are domestic goods that can be substituted, domestic goods must be used. In this way, the sales of Japanese goods in our country will be cut off, and there will be economic panic in Japan. There is no need to cross the sea to the east to conquer, which is enough to kill Japanese imperialism.</p>

<p>Zhenxin Paper and Tobacco Sundries Store, located at No. 313 Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, was opened by Gao Zhengbang, a native of Yangzhou. Gao is 34 years old and married a woman from his hometown, Zhou, who is 31 years old. At about 8 o'clock last night, when the store was about to close, three bandits with Jiangbei accents wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers suddenly came. Two bandits were guarding the door, and one entered the store with a handgun and began to overturn the money counter, hoping to rob the store. Zhou saw the opportunity and took the opportunity to escape from the store and ran into the road, shouting for help to catch the robbers. The robber in the house also rushed out of the store. Because Zhou continued to shout, the robber became anxious and fired three shots. One shot hit Zhou in the waist from behind, and Zhou fell to the ground in response. Neighbors and others rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm, but the robbers had already escaped without a trace. They rushed to search for them. Zhou's husband, Gao Zhengbang, returned home and reported to the Yangshupu Patrol Room. The patrol room immediately sent detectives to the scene to investigate and search everywhere. However, Zhou died on the spot because she was shot in a vital part. The patrol room sent the corpse to the mortuary for examination and reported to the court for an autopsy this morning.</p>

<p>Identified and Arrested by Two Detectives from the Zhejiang Provincial Government</p>
<p>Currently Investigating the Case and Detaining Him for Trial</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, two detectives from the Security Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Ying Zhiqiao and Liu Ruibiao, reported to the Laozha Patrol Room that Chen Jixue, a native of Shaoxing, had committed a major crime in Shaoxing City and Yuyao, including kidnapping Cao Zikun's son A Yu and Zhao Yinsheng's son, extorting 70,000 yuan, and killing the family members of Shen Yingxiang, the former manager of the Zhihe Qianzhuang. He is currently hiding in Room 527 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road. They requested assistance in arresting him. The chief patrol officer ordered Chinese detective Chen Yonggui and others to go to the address and arrest him. After the arrest, the police immediately reported to the First Special District Court. The criminal court of the court, Qian Hongye, interrogated him. The patrol room's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the case was serious and the patrol room was conducting a thorough investigation. Therefore, he requested that the request of the Zhejiang Security Department to transfer the case be postponed. He only requested that Chen be detained temporarily. Chen immediately claimed that the two detectives from Zhejiang Province were related to the kidnapping of the vice president of the China-South Bank and Xu Chongzhi's son, and hired lawyer Du Jimei to defend him. Judge Qian said that the patrol room only requested detention for investigation, and the details of the case had not yet been investigated. Therefore, it was not necessary to state the case. He ordered Chen Jixue to be detained for a week for further interrogation.</p>

<p>City Chamber of Commerce's Letter to the French Municipal Council</p>
<h3 id="e117">Prohibiting Police from Wantonly Prying Off Vehicle Licenses <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, which reads: "Respectfully, on the 27th of this month, the City Rickshaw Trade Association reported that member rickshaw dealers have been reporting in recent days that French Concession police officers, regardless of whether the rickshaw licenses are Chinese or French, are wantonly prying them off. Moreover, many police stations have set up counters for rickshaw pullers to pay fines, which resembles a business transaction. Upon investigation, the Municipal Council of the said concession has already issued licenses, and these licenses should be valid for passage in the Chinese areas. If rickshaw pullers violate police regulations, they would willingly accept the consequences. However, the use of brute force is unfair. Furthermore, rickshaw pullers live in extreme hardship. If they are subjected to unwarranted searches, wouldn't they be placed in a desperate situation? Therefore, we hereby petition your council to consider their plight and forward this to the French Concession Municipal Council, instructing the Municipal Council to prohibit acts of violence in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants and save the suffering of laborers." According to this, the police officers in the concession wantonly prying off rickshaw licenses is indeed a common occurrence. However, if rickshaw pullers occasionally violate police regulations, there should be proper procedures for punishment. If they pry off licenses without investigating whether there was a violation, rickshaw pullers will not be able to work and will have to painfully scrape together money to pay the fine. This is contrary to the original intention of issuing licenses. We hereby respectfully request that your esteemed council investigate and instruct the relevant authorities to prohibit such actions, so as to maintain the livelihoods of the laborers. We earnestly hope for your consideration."</p>

<p>Inviting Visitors After Establishment</p>
<p>Judge Liang Renjie of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, recognizing the overcrowding of drug offenders in the Second Special District Prison on Rue Massenet, invited philanthropists such as Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin last winter to find ways to donate funds. At the same time, he commissioned Warden Xie Fuzi of the Second Special District Prison to actively plan the establishment of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Temporary Drug Addiction Rehabilitation Center for Criminals in Ladu Lane, Ladu Fang, using medical methods to rehabilitate drug offenders on-site, so as to relieve the suffering of general criminals from their "blacklisted" pain. Xie Bihua managed the center, which was completed and established on February 1st of this year. The High Court Third Branch also commissioned Xie as the director of the center. It is now known that the center has been established for over a month and has achieved remarkable results. The internal facilities are also ready.

<p>Starting from April 1st</p>

The bureau has ordered the Finance, Public Security, and Social Affairs Bureaus to jointly discuss the inspection methods. These bureaus held a joint discussion on March 13th, with representatives from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau in attendance. It was decided that the inspection will be implemented starting from April 1st. In consideration of the merchants' difficulties, the inspection fee of 50 cents per 100 catties will be reduced to 30 cents. The Municipal Government has approved the proposal for the record, it is said.</p>
<p>Heartless Mother Driven Mad</p>

<p>Two Daughters File Suit with Uncle and Grandmother</p>
<p>Requesting Approval to Sever Guardianship</p>
<p>Yang Lindi (18 years old) and Yang Jinzhu (16 years old), two sisters residing at No. 11 Xidalu Family House, Yangjing Town, Pudong, together with their uncle Yang Liusheng and grandmother Yang Zhang Shi, have jointly engaged lawyer Qu Yue to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the Second Special District Court against their biological mother Yang Bu Shi (47 years old), who resides at No. 1, Zhicheng Fang, Lan Wei Ai Road, requesting separation and severance of guardianship, etc. The gist of their lawsuit is roughly as follows: "Mediation failed, so we respectfully file a lawsuit, requesting a judgment to prevent degradation and uphold human rights. The First and Second Plaintiffs are the daughters of the Defendant Yang Bu Shi. The bond of kinship will never be forgotten. However, since our late father passed away five years ago and the Defendant has faced difficulties in raising us, the Two Plaintiffs have been working outside to provide some financial support. Recently, the Defendant was misled by others and actually sold the Second Plaintiff to Hailin, a man from Pudong, and a woman named Alin from Ningbo, whose surname is unknown, on the fourth floor of No. 120, Hongyun Fang, Huage Nie Road. It is understood that Alin's mother, a certain old woman, intends to resell the Second Plaintiff into a secret prostitution ring. Once she enters that trap, there is no way to escape. The First Plaintiff overheard the Defendant's plan to take out the Second Plaintiff and then target her as well. She then found out the location of the Second Plaintiff. Initially, she could not find an opportunity, so she returned home. The next day, she went again. Since there were no elders present, they discussed and escaped together, returning to their hometown in Pudong. They tearfully told the Second and Fourth Plaintiffs. They felt that the Defendant's behavior had disgraced the Yang family. Once the First and Second Plaintiffs lost their footing, the regret would last forever. Since we can't avoid things, we requested mediation, hoping for a temporary separation, so that the mother and daughters could return to their original state. The Defendant indicated in court that she would agree. However, after the Defendant agreed, she demanded that a public apology be issued stating that there was no sale. In a family, obedience to elders is paramount. However, in a courtroom, with facts and truth, it is wrong to reverse the situation. Once the report is published, there is a risk of false accusations. The Plaintiffs did not dare to comply, but were willing to publish the mediation record. The Defendant insisted otherwise, resulting in the failure of the mediation, which is a great pity. The court advised us to file another lawsuit to seek legal relief. The Plaintiffs believe that separation and severance of guardianship would not cause any loss to the Defendant. It is better to obey and fall into injustice. Separation is to protect the freedom we were born with. The ancients would accept a small beating, but run away from a big one, so as not to put their parents in an unjust position. The Plaintiffs' humble intentions are also here. Furthermore, on the 9th of this month, the Plaintiffs invited relatives Bu Yunlin, Bu Zhao Gen, Yang Yunbiao, etc., to hold a family meeting. It was resolved to recognize their uncle Yang Liusheng as the guardian of the two of them, in order to take into account both law and emotions, and not to be unfilial. With this unfortunate event, we have found a better way. The Plaintiffs are protected, and the Defendant suffers no loss. Therefore, we request Your Honor to quickly schedule a trial and confirm that the First and Second Plaintiffs are under the guardianship of the Third Plaintiff Yang Liusheng, and to approve the severance of the Defendant's guardianship. The litigation costs should be borne by the Defendant." The Defendant failed to appear at the summons on the afternoon before yesterday. The First, Second, and Third Plaintiffs arrived at court with their lawyer. After Li Liang from the Fourth Division conducted a detailed examination, he scheduled the verdict to be announced on the afternoon of the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>One Detective Also Captures Two Robbers Alive</p>
<p>At 9:45 PM last night, the Huishi Police Station on Haining Road suddenly received a secret report stating that several robbers, who had repeatedly committed robbery cases in the police station's jurisdiction and were on the run, were hiding in a shack at the end of Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. After receiving the report, the police station immediately sent Deputy Detective Li Licheng to lead four detectives to secretly arrest them. However, when the detectives arrived at the destination, the robbers had already been alerted and were prepared. When the detectives surrounded the shack from different directions, the robbers opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives also returned fire, and about ten shots were fired in total. Deputy Detective Ji Licheng bravely pursued the robbers amidst the flying bullets and was shot, the bullet entering from below his right neck, causing him to fall to the ground immediately. The remaining detectives continued to press forward. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers were about to abandon their guns and flee when two of them were captured alive by the detectives. The rest scattered and fled. The detectives urgently reported to the police station, dispatched a car to take Ji Licheng to the hospital for treatment, and took the two captured robbers back to the police station for detention. They will wait to capture the accomplices before sending them to the court for trial. It is learned that Ji had served as a detective in various police stations. After being promoted to detective captain, he was transferred to the Huishi Police Station. He is a very loyal person and is deeply valued by the authorities. This time, he was injured in the line of duty, and his injuries are quite serious. His life is in danger.</p>

<p>Zhang Taijie, the general manager of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway, was sentenced to three years in prison by the Shanghai District Court for embezzling 30,000 yuan of railway funds three years ago.

He soon died in prison due to illness, and the case was closed. Unexpectedly, there was also a Sichuanese man named Liu Yajue, who was also accused of being an accomplice at the time.

<p>Dear Sir, Your newspaper's fourteenth page on the twenty-sixth of this month published a news item titled "Bureau of Public Works Approves Price Increase for Chinese Electric Cars," which stated that "the Bureau of Public Works has approved the company to increase the copper round price by two cents uniformly for the first class starting from the next month." After investigation, the Chinese Electric Company has repeatedly submitted applications to increase the price of electric car tickets, all of which have been rejected by this bureau. Recently, the company has requested a reasonable increase in ticket prices on the grounds that the price of copper rounds is depreciating daily and expenses are increasing. The bureau is discussing this matter with the Finance and Public Works Bureau and has not yet approved it. The statement in your newspaper that it has been approved is completely inconsistent with the facts. Please investigate and correct this to avoid confusion. Thank you very much. First Section, Bureau of Public Works, Shanghai Municipality, March 28th, Republic of China, Chen Bao Newspaper Office.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Degenerate Family <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Qu Zaoqi, Suzhou 丨丨</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief: I am a young man who has just turned twenty. Every time I read your newspaper, I always read the Reader's Consultant first. I am happy to see your insightful opinions and guide young people on the right path. Now I will truthfully tell you about my personal experiences and hope that you can give me a perfect answer. When I was fifteen years old, just after graduating from elementary school, my meddling parents married me to a woman three years older than me who I had never met before. It's a pity that I didn't know what marriage was at that time, which led to today's big mistake! After marriage, because my family situation was still acceptable, I continued my studies. Less than half a year later, my father passed away due to illness. At this time, I was only sixteen years old, and all the family affairs were in my mother's hands. However, my mother was usually idle, and once she took power, she consumed as much as possible. At first, she went in and out of gambling places, then she indulged in opium smoking and spent all day with gentlemen. In addition, after my father passed away, my uncles fought for the property, and lawsuits occurred, so the family fell into bankruptcy. My father's inheritance has almost disappeared so far. Although I struggled to continue my studies, I am now in a provincial vocational school, and there are still more than two years before graduation. During these years, I am preparing to acquire the skills to live independently and get rid of this dark family. Unfortunately, my degenerate mother still feels that her own consumption is not enough. A year ago, she hooked up with a comrade and lived an inhuman life together. Although I have advised her several times, she turned a deaf ear. Knowing that there is no hope, I turned to focus on my wife, hoping to give her all kinds of comfort and encourage each other to strive for the future. However, misfortunes never come singly. My mother has already degenerated, and my wife has followed in her footsteps. This time, when I returned to my hometown during the winter vacation, I contracted gonorrhea, which made my body even weaker. According to medical principles, it is enough to prove that she (referring to my wife) has betrayed me. Although she is an illiterate village girl and the difference in education between us is huge, we have had a history of five or six years together and have a considerable friendship, and she has already given birth to a son and a daughter. I don't have any extravagant expectations, but I really hope that she can be my lifelong companion. Now that she is like this again, what can I do? Because of the mental and physical suffering, my studies and health have been greatly affected. Mr. has seen and heard a lot, is there anyone whose family situation is worse than mine? Now I am determined to study hard so that I can contribute as much as possible to society and ignore everything else. However, can I continue my studies in these few years? Is there a proper way out after graduation? These are important questions. Now I am exposing the dark secrets of my family nakedly, hoping that Mr. has any other good methods and can give me a detailed answer!</p>
<p>Answer: When a family reaches this point, the only thing to do is to sever ties with them decisively. Even if this leads to dropping out of school and becoming a wanderer outside (this is naturally not a good solution, it is best to find a job), it is better than living in that kind of rotten family. As for your wife, if you have a way and are willing to continue your old relationship with her, that would naturally be good, but if this does not happen, you will still not be able to escape the circle of the old family 丨 this would be difficult! Finally, I have one more word of advice for you. Since you have contracted gonorrhea, you should reduce sexual intercourse as much as possible, eat less stimulating foods, and get treatment quickly. It is better to get injections, otherwise, this problem will be more cruel than anything else!</p>

Members of the Ping Branch, Zhang Yihui, 　Jici, Feng Zuxun, and others went south tonight and decided on four proposals: 1. Proposal for the Review of Physical Terms; 2. Proposal for Curriculum Standards for Middle School Physics Textbooks and Reference Books; 3. Proposal for Minimum Standards for Middle School Physics Equipment; 4. Proposal for National Defense Research Issues.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department Formulated</p>
<h3 id="e140">Standards for Music Teaching Materials <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education previously issued a general order to all subordinate departments to submit music teaching materials for review. Recently, at a department affairs meeting, it formulated a standard for music teaching materials, the main purpose of which is to promote nationalistic songs. It ordered all schools to comply with it uniformly. From now on, throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, only generous and passionate sounds will be heard, and the previously decadent and vulgar songs will be completely eliminated. This is truly a grand event in the education industry. The original standards are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Standards for Music Teaching Materials for Schools at All Levels in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>A. Music Teaching Materials That Should Be Actively Promoted</p>
<p>(1) Those that promote national spirits such as benevolence, love, peace, bravery, and heroism;</p>
<p>(2) Those that encourage national thoughts such as patriotism, saving the country, and building the country;</p>
<p>(3) Those that cultivate national characteristics such as passion, generosity, endeavor, and progress.</p>

<p>(1) Those that cultivate feelings of harmony, beauty, strength, and composure;</p>
<p>(2) Those that model pure and upright character, noble, independent, and free character;</p>
<p>(3) Pure artistic music with upright style.</p>
<p>C. Music Teaching Materials That Must Be Absolutely Prohibited</p>
<p>(1) Those with romantic, decadent, weak, or vulgar colors;</p>
<p>(2) Those with superstitious, reactionary, or other unreasonable thoughts;</p>
<p>(3) Other music teaching materials that are not suitable for the character and learning ability of young students.</p>
<p>D. Other Points to Note</p>
<p>(1) Chinese songs should be the main focus, and it is not appropriate to sing too many foreign songs, especially foreign songs;</p>
<p>(2) The correct score should be the main focus, Chinese musical instruments should be used as much as possible, and Beijing opera and Kunqu opera should not be used as teaching materials;</p>
<p>(3) Simple classical Chinese or vernacular Chinese should be the main focus, and stiff, archaic, or other difficult words and phrases should be avoided.</p>

<p>The recent political encirclement journals of the Ministry of Education are as follows: (1) The Anhui Education Department presented an inquiry as to whether the senior high school normal school department should set separate examination subjects and hold them uniformly with the ordinary department, or whether the department should propose strict examination methods.

(2) The Ministry of Education has announced the appointment of Guo Youshou and Yang Lian as education design specialists. (3) The Ministry responded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the revision of the draft agreement on international circulation of educational films, stating that our country can express its approval, but must reserve the right of inspection to prevent abuses.

<p>Should Be Posted in Classrooms of All Levels</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued instructions to the municipal primary and secondary schools in Huhnan, Zhabei, and Pengpu, stating that after the Municipal Health Bureau and the Education Bureau sent personnel to inspect the physical condition of the students in each school, the results are detailed in the health record films. In addition to keeping the record films in the school for future reference, two copies of the student's physical defect and correction record table will be printed and filled out by the school, with one copy submitted to the bureau and the other posted in the classrooms of each level of the school. The purpose is to enable the students themselves and the faculty and staff to pay attention to the correction of students' physical defects and the progress of their health at all times. Schools that have already inspected the physical condition of all students before the New Year can copy the defects of each student into the defect and correction record table according to the existing records and post them in the classrooms separately. As for the re-examination of the physical condition of old students, it will be implemented after the number of school health workers is slightly increased.

<p>April 9th and 15th</p>
<p>The rumor of the resumption of the China-Portugal Cup football match has been reported in the previous newspapers. Now, the sports authorities of China and Portugal are making every effort to promote this matter. It was originally planned to be held at present, but the continuous spring rain has prevented the Western League and the Chinese Football Association from finishing on schedule. Therefore, the competition has to be postponed slightly. According to the notification from the Chinese Sports Association yesterday, it has been decided to hold it on April 9th (Sunday) and April 15th (Saturday) at the China National Amateur Athletic Federation's athletic field on Route Pere Robert. During this bright spring season for sports, the focus will shift accordingly. The football season is coming to an end, but unexpectedly there will be a grand football match to reward the fans, which is a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>A Brief History of the China-Portugal Cup: As for the history of the China-Portugal Cup, it has been reported in this newspaper. The cup was donated by the Portuguese Sports Association of Shanghai, worth more than 300 gold pieces, for three matches and two wins, in order to promote the friendship between the two countries in sports and to learn from each other. Each year, a three-match, two-win system is adopted to determine the annual winner. If a team wins consecutively for three years, it will be honored to permanently preserve the cup. In the past, the two countries have each won one year. This year is the final key to the cup's gain or loss, and both sides will compete with all their strength.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Strengths of China and Portugal: The strength between the two countries is very strong. The Chinese team has the Donghua and Youyou Jinan teams, which won the Western League Group A championship, with many good generals and talents. Portugal won the Shanghai International Football Championship in 1929, and its reputation has long been established. Almost everyone who knows the history of football in Shanghai knows this. In recent years, it seems to have faded and declined, but the veterans are still scattered among the strong teams of the Western League, such as the French Business Association, which has strong combat effectiveness and outstanding results. Most of its players are Portuguese, such as Marcel, Remydi, and Favanque, all of whom are famous generals. Once China and Portugal go to war, the outcome is unpredictable, and the grand occasion can be expected.</p>

<p>China-England International Shooting Competition</p>
<p>The Situation Between the Two Sides is Gradually Tense</p>
<p>Today, Zhang Yingda Faces Niemann</p>
<p>A Pair of Veteran Soldiers on the Battlefield... Striving for Victory</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results: Chinese Liu Zongfu Disappointed, British Packer Particularly Good</p>
<p>1000 Points to 711 Points, a Defeat of 289 Points</p>
<p>The Total Number of Points for the Two Days Shows That China Still Leads by 104 Points</p>
<p>In the China-England International Shooting Competition, today is the third day, and the situation between the two sides is gradually tense. Today, the Chinese and English representatives Zhang Yingda and Niemann are both veterans of the battlefield, and each will strive for victory for their country. On the first day, Xu Shizhang won 393 points for China. Yesterday, Liu changed his usual state and suffered at the hands of the enemy, losing 289 points. The total number of points for the two days shows that China still leads by 104 points.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Packer's Performance Was Particularly Good <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>All those watching from the sidelines unanimously praised the performance of British Packer. The second half was particularly good. Before the last shot to reach the goal was finished, there were already as many as 95 points. Therefore, Liu Zongfu's failure was not simply due to bad luck. Packer's huge scores that day, such as 32, 61, 32, 81, 77, and 95, were on average more impressive than in the past. His maturity and steadiness were well-deserved. Within the first ten shots of the first half, he had not yet gained momentum. Around twenty shots, he began to advance fiercely and took the lead with 293 to 144. He suddenly suffered a blow and fell behind again. Near the end, he won another 23 points (500 to 477), and in the second half he continued to add points, gaining 81 points and seizing the superior position. From then on, he had smooth sailing, and by the end, before the last shot was finished, he had already won by 289 points.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Liu Zongfu Changed His Usual State <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zongfu's usual performance is superior to that of his opponent. Generally, people thought that Liu's chances of victory were greater. Even Packer regarded him as a strong opponent and was unwilling to let him go easily. However, Liu suddenly changed his usual state and suffered setbacks one after another. The reason was also that he was competing for the first time in a formal competition, and he was inevitably flustered in the face of the battle. Observing him not long after the start of the match, the gun and bullets failed to cooperate, and he wandered on a divergent path, not knowing where to go. He continued to lose as much as 150 points. Fortunately, he turned back in time, calmed his will, first firmly defended, repelling the enemy from thousands of miles away, and then, when there was an opportunity, he attacked, increasing his score. In the third set of three-five, two-three, and four-six, he suddenly took the lead, gaining fifty points. The good times did not last, and Liu fell into a state of confusion again, leading to a complete downfall. In the second half, Liu tried to remain calm, but it was difficult to do as he wished. He sighed and returned in disappointment. There are many days to come, and Liu should make redoubled efforts to avenge his previous shame.</p>
<p>Municipal Education Bureau Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e165">Held a Sports Lecture <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Invited Mr. Shen Siliang to Speak</p>
<p>And Held a Certificate and Award Ceremony</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau held a sports lecture and awarded certificates of qualification to the health personnel training class and prizes to the winners of the health speech contest yesterday afternoon from 2:30 PM in the auditorium of Wuben Girls' Middle School. Li Ting'an, director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Zhou Feicheng, section chief of the Municipal Education Bureau, Ma Chonggan, Zhou Shang, Lu Bingyun, Li Wanyu, Wang Keyong, and other standing committee members of the health education committee sports group, as well as principals and physical education teachers of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, graduates of the health personnel training class, and winners of the health speech contest, totaling more than 500 people, attended. The details are divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Situation of Awarding Prizes: After Chairman Zhou Feicheng performed the ceremony, the chairman first reported on the process of running the health training class and the health speech contest. Then, Director Li Ting'an of the Health Bureau delivered a training speech, roughly stating that health is closely related to the survival of individuals, society, and the nation. There are many reasons for China's current national crisis, but the unhealthy psychology and unhealthy bodies of the Chinese people are a major reason. Because of unhealthy psychology, phenomena such as irresponsibility and selfishness occur. Because of unhealthy bodies, there is a lack of vigor and spirit in doing things, and phenomena such as fear and contentment in the face of things occur. The health training class and speech contest held by the Education and Health Bureaus are not effective enough to be universal, so I hope that everyone will study without being confined to their location and spread and develop it from the sea to the whole country in order to achieve great results. Finally, Chairman Zhou Feicheng issued certificates of qualification for the health class, certificates of merit for the first place in the examination of the health class in each district, and certificates of merit and medals for the winners of the speech contest. Then, the meeting was photographed and dismissed.</p>
<p>Shen Siliang's Lecture: After the awarding of prizes, Dr. Shen Siliang spoke on the theory and practice of physical education for young people and children, roughly stating that life is divided into four major periods: infancy, childhood, adulthood, and old age. The so-called young people and children are between the ages of one and twenty, accounting for one-third of their lives. If young people cannot be properly educated, it will be enough to affect their whole lives, and physical education is the movement of life, which is related whether in the reading era or the old age. Our daily movements and habits are customary and unconscious, which are habits formed from childhood. If good habits are not formed in childhood, they will not be easily changed in the future, so everyone should first pay attention to cultivating good habits in children. Chinese physical education has always paid attention to the abnormal development of championship teams, etc., which is especially inappropriate for children. Therefore, primary school teachers must provide comprehensive training for children's physical education, using their playful nature to guide them, and should have a good sports environment, comparison of group sports, encouragement of prizes, etc., in order to arouse children's interest in physical education.</p>
<p>Questions for Discussion: For example, primary schools suggest: (1) What are the minimum number of sports equipment that should be used in primary schools? (2) What is appropriate for boarding students in rural schools to do morning exercises and interval exercises? (3) What kind of games are appropriate for boys and girls to exercise together? Mr. Shen answered: (1) It should be based on the amount of school funding and the number of students. It is best to use 10% to 15% of the school's funding for sports equipment. (2) If there are no morning exercises or interval exercises, it is also appropriate. (3) Students over the age of ten should exercise separately because of the different natures of boys and girls. Finally, Shao Rugan of the Education Bureau explained the teaching materials for the assembly exercise and discussed various issues of the second sports games, and then dismissed the meeting.</p>

<p>There were originally four matches in the Middle School Basketball League yesterday. Unexpectedly, in the third match between Nanyang Business School and Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, a fight broke out. The match was terminated. The situation at the time is briefly described below. After the start of the match, Nanyang took the lead throughout. The result of the first half was 11 to 5. In the second half, the two sides held each other until the last two minutes, when the players on both sides resorted to violence. Before the referee could announce the result, the players and cheerleaders rushed into the court, creating an unprecedented bad phenomenon. Therefore, the match could not be completed. The Middle School Sports Federation will hold an emergency meeting at 10 AM this Friday (the 31st) to discuss and resolve the matter. The results of the other two matches are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e174">On Achieving Resistance Capability <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of resisting Japan and saving the nation, the best method is naturally "long-term resistance." However, long-term resistance is not easy. It requires not only the determination to resist, but also the "capability to resist." We have certainly had the "determination" for a long time. The central government has repeatedly stated that it "already has the determination," and in the letters and telegrams of the generals, all righteously and indignantly stated, "To die for the country is to live forever, even in death," showing that we have long possessed "determination." What we lack now is only the "capability to resist."</p>
<p>"Saving the nation without following the right path, struggling without proper methods," everyone only knows to blindly save the nation, and engage in clamorous struggles. The "result of resistance" is that it "does not harm the enemy's slightest hair." Therefore, resistance must first have the capability to resist; otherwise, "the country will still be destroyed." It would be better to adopt non-resistance.</p>
<p>What is "resistance capability"? It is:</p>
<p>First, it is "having received national education and possessing the spirit of the National Revolutionary Army." "We often see those whose material resources are inferior to others but whose spirit surpasses them achieving victory." (Note by Da: like the A-Q type).</p>
<p>Second, it is "enriching the nation's production capacity (Note by Da: such as planting ××, etc.), and then thinking of various methods (methods detailed later) to make the nation's production capacity applicable as military force." (Note by Da: such as ×× public sales, etc.).</p>
<p>The first item is "spiritual education," which is most beneficial for long-term resistance. "Ten years of training," that's what it means. Anyone can understand it at a glance. The second item is not only a military issue, but also involves political, social, and other issues, which seems more difficult to understand. Since it has already been clearly stated to enrich the nation's production capacity, and that material is inferior to spirit has also been established as a law, then what is to be produced here is probably and certainly "spiritual production." What is spiritual production? It is still nothing more than the "determination" for long-term resistance and the "confidence" of ascending to heaven after death. As for the so-called various methods, they are nothing more than issuing national salvation bonds, collecting national salvation donations, and launching the aviation national salvation movement initiated by the people, etc., etc.</p>
<p>National salvation bonds are issued by the government, and national salvation donations can be advanced by each province in different ways. As for aviation national salvation, it is an extra contribution, and regardless of wealth or poverty, everyone naturally has the obligation to "contribute money." In this way, the determination to resist exists, and the capability to resist also exists. From now on, we should have no worries about the country's destruction. As for "weak physical strength and high blood pressure," that doesn't matter, because spirit ultimately prevails over matter.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Li Huiying on the Riverbank <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>A person quietly walked to the riverbank and stood there blankly.</p>
<p>Let me count it. Ah, it's been more than thirteen months since I left this place. After a long absence, I really don't know how happy I am! Especially the warm spring sun, which makes people feel lazy, and from time to time there is a breeze blowing from the sea and from the fields, which simply intoxicates people.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes, which had been restricted by the city for thirteen months, and looked at the opposite riverbank as I had done thirteen months ago. Nothing has changed, the opposite riverbank! There are still green trees, still green fields, still a patch of beach emerging on the riverbank, and there are still the thatched sheds that some people consider unsightly and the smoke constantly rising from the thatched sheds, with a blue sky setting off the distant places behind.</p>
<p>Looking out at the sea, it is just as it used to be, a large expanse of bright white and dark water, with the sky and water tightly connected, sailboats, steamers, and the Empress constantly coming and going, and even the seabirds skimming the water still show their sweet smiles of the past.</p>
<p>After thirteen months of separation, my riverbank, where I used to swim for four years, has not changed much.</p>
<p>Really, nothing has changed? No, there are some differences after all. As soon as I saw the large gap in the riverbank at my feet, I remembered that it was indeed different. There is no doubt that it was bombarded by the artillery fire of Japanese imperialism. This huge scar, however, has grown green grass after thirteen months. Perhaps, after some time, the scar will completely change and not attract anyone's attention. However, I can never forget it!</p>
<p>Turning around to look at the area behind me, there are many more different places: in the distance, Wusong Town presents a scene of rubble, the red brick buildings of the university hall still have the walls after the bombing, and the radio station has only one iron pole left; nearby, the dilapidated station and the completely burned thatched houses! Now only a flat ground remains, the missing seaside hotel and exquisite bungalows, and the many familiar faces of the past, students, villagers, playful children, station staff, policemen, and even a few familiar village dogs are gone, not to be seen. How can it be said that it is the same as before?</p>
<p>Isn't all of this a gift from the "January 28th Incident"? Thirteen months ago, wasn't this place the scene of the Japanese imperialist war of aggression every day? Airplanes, bombs, artillery, and machine guns flew, roared, and bombed, turning the area along the riverbank, houses, livestock, and people into ruins.</p>
<p>But these are still visible traces. As for those anti-imperialist warriors who fought for national survival, their sacrificed lives and their shed red blood, are there no traces of them now? And who would think of these things? Hasn't even a painting of broken walls and ruins been left behind?</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," I thought. "Soldiers are bound to die sooner or later, and they died in the anti-imperialist war, which is very glorious, isn't it? And," I changed my mind again, "isn't it because they were not afraid of death that they created a few national heroes for our Republic of China? That China, a colonized country, would produce a few national heroes. Wouldn't that make everything easier? Wouldn't that bring glory to the international community as well!"</p>
<p>Alas, I really don't know where the souls of these dead warriors (if they really have souls) have gone. Perhaps they are complaining and regretting their deaths...</p>
<p>Forget it, don't look anymore, don't think anymore. A person quietly walked down the riverbank and headed home. At this moment, in my heart, there was a kind of indescribable pain.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Wang Wanrong, the Nun Daosu <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Daosu is dead. From now on, the nightingale's singing will no longer be heard in the Nunnery of Chastity, and the fragrance of white lotuses will no longer be smelled!</p>
<p>I met Daosu in the late spring four years ago.</p>
<p>The Nunnery of Chastity is at the foot of Qin Mountain. Although it was late spring, there was still no murmur of birds or fragrant flowers. Only a bright, beaded waterfall flowed straight down from Qin Mountain like falling clouds and scattered cotton. After falling to the ground, it flowed right in front of the nunnery. On both sides of the nunnery, there were towering ancient trees, and in a tomb among the ancient trees lay a deceased old nun. Standing in the main hall of the Nunnery of Chastity, we could hear the gurgling of the spring and the surging of the pine waves. Therefore, the nuns in the nunnery were not very lonely. This place was not as gloomy as other nunneries, like an ancient tomb.</p>
<p>Daosu was a thin little nun. No one knew her background, and no one knew when she became a nun. She was good at closing her eyes and sighing with her eyebrows raised. Her pure white face and delicate body made one think of a white lotus in clear water at first sight. And when she sat cross-legged in front of the idol, reaching out from the black, wide cassock and gently tapping the wooden fish, chanting scriptures in a melodious voice, her leisurely demeanor and clear voice made one think of the low singing of a nightingale under the moon. Who says the Nunnery of Chastity is lonely? There is the gurgling of the spring and the surging of the pine waves. Who says it is always winter in the Nunnery of Chastity? Where does the low singing of the nightingale and the faint fragrance of the white lotus come from in winter?</p>
<p>Now, two years have passed. The gurgling of the spring is still there, and the surging of the pine waves remains. But the singing of the nightingale can no longer be heard, and the fragrance of the white lotus can no longer be smelled!</p>
<p>Daosu! If you also have a soul that exists in another world, I hope there are also pine waves, streams, clear breezes, and bright moons there, and you can still sing like a nightingale and sway like a white lotus!</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Philosophy of Life by Yang Liuan <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Those who study philosophy are almost always said to be crazy because these things have nothing to do with firewood, rice, oil, and salt. However, the "philosophy of life" is indispensable!</p>
<p>Some doctors and scholars initially really went to study some "outlines" and some "histories" in a dull-headed way, but after understanding the "philosophy of life," they immediately threw these things aside. This is because these things are only good for people to use as toilet paper and do not quite coincide with the first chapter of "The ABCs of Getting Promoted and Making a Fortune" in the "philosophy of life." Getting promoted and making a fortune, the shortcut lies in Zhongnan Mountain.</p>
<p>What is the shortcut? Nothing else, "flattery" and "bragging." Everyone can do "flattery" and "bragging," but the skills are different. For example, the League of Nations investigation report, written for foreign dignitaries and pleasing to the local government, must show the spirit of "independence" and say repeatedly, "Excellent, excellent! Justice prevails, and reason is upheld!" This is the positive way of flattering. (Choosing foreign horses to flatter is an even more powerful method.) For example, some people want to fight for the protection of civil rights, and you want to please the government, so you say, "Civil rights are tied to the law. Once the constitution is successful, civil rights will naturally be protected. You cannot think from a political standpoint, but must demand from a legal standpoint. (Isn't the government clearly drafting a constitution?! But this sentence cannot be explicitly stated.)" This is the way of implying flattery.</p>
<p>As for "bragging," for example, you can say that any old novel is good. Write a preface to that novel, describing it in a dazzling way, and then "curious" people will fall into your trap, and then you can get a sum of writing fees from the cracks in the book buying. For example, if you "brag" yourself into a world scholar, a first-class celebrity, someone will invite you to give a lecture, and then you can brag again, and each time you can get a "travel expense" of 5,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>These are just two examples. In fact, there are many other methods. But in short, both "flattery" and "bragging" must have one condition: a thick face. And you also have to be able to "endure." For example, if you are given a position like Minister of Education, it is best not to do it, because there are better things than that. You might as well wait.</p>
<p>With all these methods, the "philosophy of life" is accomplished. A "verse" is composed:</p>
<p>The philosophy of life is to seek fame and profit. To seek fame and profit, flatter and brag. Your face must be thick, and your heart must be soft. "Independent," "bragging," and "flattering" are different from ordinary people. This is how I see it: How fitting, how fitting! Why is it not fitting?</p>

<p>"Where did you go in China? Why don't you keep to the time?"</p>
<p>As soon as Tang Yaoxing picked him up, he asked him with a half-smiling, half-annoyed pinching of his lips.</p>
<p>"I went to see a movie."</p>
<p>Haiquan replied with a smile, and saw that there were two young men he did not know sitting in Tang Yaoxing's room.</p>
<p>"You are really a little bourgeois, a leisure class!"</p>
<p>Yaoxing scolded him with a smile. But Haiquan just smiled. Stepping into the room, he asked the two young men sitting there for their names.</p>
<p>"Let me introduce you..."</p>
<p>Tang Yaoxing laughed before he spoke.</p>
<p>"...This Mr. Zheng Jiaqi is a feudal remnant from Zhejiang. This Mr. Liu Songxin is a local tyrant from Shanxi... This is... is a compradore class, a pretty boy from Guangdong, Mr. Lin Haiquan..."</p>
<p>"Nonsense! How am I a compradore class?"</p>
<p>So the four of them burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"There's good news tonight... Let's go quickly, let's call a car to go faster."</p>
<p>"What's the good news?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen will report to us after we get there."</p>
<p>They all fell silent and walked out together. Tang Yaoxing went to a car dealership to call a car. The three of them just stood at the entrance of the alley and waited for him.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked them.</p>
<p>"I don't know either."</p>
<p>Zheng Jiaqi replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"I heard we're going to a foreign hotel."</p>
<p>After that, there was silence. In a moment, the car that Tang Yaoxing was sitting in drove up. The three of them got into the car.</p>
<p>"Where to?"</p>
<p>Haiquan heard the driver asking Yaoxing. Yaoxing answered the driver in a very low voice. Haiquan couldn't hear clearly where he said to go.</p>

<p>Struggling Within Ninety Yuan</p>
<p>New High Price Appeared in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Ending Still Up Five Yuan and Four Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday the gold market continued to rise, reaching a new high price of 1,091 yuan, but people's hearts were not very stable, so although the foreign exchange market was tight, there were struggles from time to time. The spot arrivals were overwhelming, and the swap discount had been reduced to 234 yuan. Spot accounts were actively swapped out. Early in the morning, the London major wire quoted a near-far term spread of minus 0.0625, British-American exchange rate of minus 0.875, American-British down 75, New York silver price down 0.125. Although the forward silver price for the three-month term was up by 3 dimes, the October and December terms were both down by 1%. In addition, the bank's private wire quoted a high of minus 0.0625, and American cotton was down 19 pound notes. Initially, the raw board was called at 87.8 yuan, but because the private wire reported a high of minus 0.0625 at this time, Dadaicheng and others sold off, so the opening price was reduced to 1,083 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened flat, then fell from 4 yuan to 1,080 yuan and 5 jiao. Huabi and Mitsui both bid for July US dollars at 30 yuan, and then it was pulled up. The banks had a very good appetite, and the market became tighter and tighter. Although the gold market turned back, the process was very small. The HSBC listing revealed that the shilling was unchanged and the US dollar was down 0.125. Afterwards, it was even better. The July US dollar at 29.875 yuan could not be settled in and broke through 90 yuan, once rallying to 91 yuan before leveling off, so the noon close was 1,088 yuan. The afternoon opened at 1,089 yuan and 3 jiao. Initially, due to brokers offering July US dollars at 875, it fell back to 87.2 jiao, but afterwards, because 8125 was still difficult to settle, and the Mumbai price was down 2 annas, it rose to 1,092 yuan, but because there were many sellers of July 75, it could not rise further and gradually fell back. The June US dollar at 99.5 jiao was blocked by the banks and fell back to 87.8 jiao. Mumbai reported a second decline of minus 9 annas and recovered 2 yuan in value, but eventually closed flat at 1,087 yuan and 9 jiao. Xia Chi added 38 yuan and 36 yuan, and the guest gang sold off. The daily market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 1,083 yuan, slightly up half a yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 3 yuan and 3 jiao. The foreign exchange market opened flat. Recent quotes showed British exchange at 1 shilling 8 pence 4375 and US exchange at 99 yuan and 0625. Yifengyong sold off, gradually falling from 4 yuan to within 1 yuan. Dadaicheng took in notes, pulling up more than 1 yuan. Fuchang also sold off, falling to 1,080 yuan and 5 jiao. Huabi first bid for July US dollars at 30 yuan. Zhaofengchang came up to buy in at 1 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengyu further advanced to 2 yuan. Korea also took in July US dollars at 30 yuan. Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, and Dadaicheng scrambled to buy, rising to over 3 yuan. Goods also came to swap. Dadaicheng's buying interest was still strong, rising to around 4 yuan. Mitsui also took in July US dollars at only 99 yuan and 9375. Yuanshengyong, Chunyuanyong, and Hengyu came in, rallying to 35 and a half yuan. Although there was a retreat of 1 yuan, the trend was still rising. Hengyu and Fuyu came in to buy again. Macalister bid for July US exchange at 99 yuan and 875. Dadaicheng bought up to 8 yuan and a half, because Citibank also ate March US dollars at 125. Zhaofengchang disposed of its holdings, slightly declining. Yuankangxiang and Qianchangxiang bought notes, still outside 8 yuan. Mitsui blocked out April gold at 6875. Dadaicheng disposed of its holdings, falling back 2 yuan to 6 yuan and a half. HSBC's listing revealed that the shilling was unchanged and the US dollar was down 0.125. People's hearts were revived. Yuanchun and Yuankangxiang came to buy again, so the foreign exchange market was very good, up to outside 9 yuan. Daxingyong and others limited their holdings and disposed of them, struggling slightly. However, the domestic board was very tight, and July US dollars at 875 were difficult to settle. Fuyu bought up to 90 yuan. Macalister settled in July US dollars at 8125, rising to 1,091 yuan. Many people disposed of their holdings. Hengxing came in and then went out, and the gold price fell further to 88 yuan. Wanxing went to the market to buy in, pulling it up to 9 yuan and a half. Zhejiang sold to Zhongfu and Shanghai June US dollars at 5625, so it hovered around 8 yuan for a long time. Datong bid for July US dollars at 875. Although it rose slightly, because Daxingyong and Yuanmaoyong both came to sell, although it declined, it was still able to hold on. And when Jinliansai blocked June US dollars at 625 and July US dollars at 8125, Fuchang sold off and fell to 86 yuan and a half. Yingfengheng, Yuankangxiang all took in, up to outside 8 yuan. Qianchangxiang and Dadaicheng then went to yuan. Hengxing came to buy again, breaking through to 91 yuan, but because Zhifengyong sold hard, it could not rise further and returned downstream, falling to within 88 yuan. After hovering, the noon close was 1,088 yuan. After the close, Hengxing dumped, up to over 90 yuan, so the goods were relatively high, bidding at 9 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 1,089 yuan and 3 jiao. Goods opened at 9 yuan. Ruikang first took in, rising from 9 yuan to 9 yuan and a half. Brokers offered July US dollars at 99 yuan and 875. Fuyu sold to within 8 yuan to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. At this time, there were few transactions, so after being slightly taken in by retail investors, it rose to around 8 yuan. And when Hengxing went to the market to buy in, the market situation showed its brilliance. Huabi took in July US dollars at 8125 and improved to outside 8 yuan. Before long, this price was difficult to settle. Yuankangxiang further advanced to 9 yuan and 1 jiao. Zhaofengchang disposed of its holdings and fell to 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengxing still came to buy, and the trend was stable, gradually rising. Dadaicheng came to buy vigorously, breaking through to outside 90 yuan. The foreign exchange market was slightly tight. Fuyu took advantage of the situation to buy and reached 91 yuan. Mumbai telegraphed a drop of 2 annas. Hengyu advanced further, adding to 1,092 yuan, which was a new high price. Zhifengyong Xian came out, and the rising path was blocked, and a reversal was seen. Macalister blocked out July US dollars at 99 yuan and 75. Zhaofengchang still came to dispose of its holdings, falling back to within 90 yuan to 89 yuan and 3 jiao. Goods made a header to enter the note, pulling up about 2 yuan. At this time, it hovered around 90 yuan. Erjing then blocked July US dollars at 99 yuan and 75. Zhaofengchang still remained on the selling side, and the gold price hovered and fell. And because June US dollars at 99 yuan and a half could be settled, Yuankangxiang sold to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. Mumbai telegraphed another drop of 9 annas. Hengyu advanced to 9 yuan and 6 jiao. HSBC disposed of May US dollars at 99 yuan and 25, still unable to support it. Hengxing, on behalf of its clients, suddenly came to continuously dispose of its holdings, falling back to within 8 yuan. Dadaicheng also sold to 7 yuan and 4 jiao. After this, the situation was peaceful, with only a few jiao of struggle. Extending to the close, it was 1,087 yuan and 9 jiao. There was not much rise and fall after the close, but the trend was slightly down, because Hengxing limited its holdings and disposed of them, so the goods were slightly suppressed, bidding at 7 yuan and a half. The lowest price for the day was 1,080 yuan and a half, and the highest price was 1,092 yuan, with a rise and fall of 11 yuan and 5 jiao. As a result, it continued to rise by 5 yuan and 4 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The revealed price was 98 yuan and 625 jiao because the HSBC bank listed the US exchange at 0.125, and the alloy price was 1,164 yuan, which was about 76 yuan based on the closing price. The difference compared to the previous close was extremely small. The accounting price for April was 1,117 yuan, the accounting for May was 1,088 yuan, and the supplementary water was 1,112 yuan.</p>
<p>The in-market transactions were mediocre. In summary, Hengxing, Dadaicheng, Yuankangxiang, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Yuanchun, Fuyu, Wanxing, Chunyuanyong, and others were all buyers. Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Daxingyong, Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Tongyi, and others were all sellers. The Dalian gang slightly took in. The Guang gang Hengxing traded not much in the front and back markets, rolling in two or three hundred notes. Fuyu, Zhifengyong, Dadaicheng, Hengxing, etc., advanced first and then came out. In addition, there were very few whole numbers.</p>
<p>Xia Chi's market was slightly cheaper yesterday, calculated with an addition of 38 yuan. Tongfengyong bought in from the market, and the guest gang sold, completing 70 taels. Later, it was done at 367 yuan, which was taken in by Yingfengheng and sold out by the guest gang. The market conditions were still flat.</p>
<p>The swap was very cheap. The empty side immediately offered 4 yuan on the market. Fuchang gave 140 notes to Dafengheng, and Jinfu gave 14 notes to Yingfengheng, all for 4 yuan. Shenkang gave a total of 210 notes to Yingfengheng, 3 yuan and 7 jiao, and 140 notes, 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Zhifengyong gave 70 notes to Runchangyong, only 3 yuan and a half. Hengxing transferred 210 notes of April transactions to Yingfengheng at a price of 1,112 yuan. In the after-market, Fuchang gave 140 notes to Yingfengheng at a price of 3 yuan and 2 jiao. Shenkang gave 175 notes to Yingfengheng, also for 3 yuan and 2 jiao. There were a total of 889 notes traded today, and the spot account Yingfengheng accounted for the majority, swapping out a total of 679 notes. There were still several hundred notes swapped out in the after-market the day before yesterday. A certain gang's spot arrival can be imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Foreign Exchange British Flat American Tight <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>

The American exchange opened at 99 yuan and 0625, slightly tighter by 0.0625 compared to the previous close. After opening, the situation was calm, and transactions were not strong. When the gold price was low and then recovered, Huabi and Korea both bid for November US dollars at 30 yuan, gradually tightening after entering the market. HSBC's listing revealed that the shilling was unchanged and the US dollar was down 0.125. At this time, it was still flat, and when the July US dollars at 99 yuan and 875 were difficult to settle, 8125 became the price for bank entry and exit. When the noon close was recently quoted, the British exchange was 1 shilling 8 pence 375, and the American exchange was 98 yuan and 9375. The after-market was initially flat and then tight. When the market opened, brokers sold July US dollars at 99 yuan and 875 to the gold industry, but after entering the market, buying and selling were both at 8125. Mumbai initially reported a drop of 2.4 annas, and this price was difficult to settle. It then went to 75, which was sold by the bank, so it loosened to 8125. The second time Mumbai telegraphed a small drop of 9, 10, and 12 annas. Although there was no better transaction, the banks all bid for July US dollars at 8125. When the market closed, the recently quoted British exchange was 1 shilling 8 pence 375, slightly tighter by 0.0625 compared to the previous close.

<p>Demand Exceeds Supply, Market Prices Rise</p>
<p>Various Bonds Reach New High Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, March futures had ceased trading, with only April and January being traded. Transactions were still active. Demand from the Northern Syndicate and retail investors remained strong, leading to gradual increases in prices. During the initial opening in the morning, "Demobilization &amp; Troop Reduction" and "19 Customs" were flat and slightly weak. "19 Charity" rose due to purchases by the Northern Syndicate. Most syndicates and retail investors were net buyers, causing market prices to gradually increase, with most rising by about half a yuan. In the second round, the supply and demand remained imbalanced, with "Troop Reduction" surging by 6 jiao and 5 fen, and the rest continuing to rise by 2 jiao and 5 fen. At the afternoon opening, both "No. 1" and "No. 16" saw demand, leading to another increase of half a yuan. At the closing, due to profit-taking by many bulls, "Demobilization", "Troop Reduction" and "19 Customs" remained unchanged, while the entering [price?] decreased slightly, but only by 1 or 2 jiao. The trend remained steady, mainly due to abundant loose money and the lack of further expansion of the war, which boosted market confidence. As a result of yesterday's market prices, prices increased by 3-4 jiao to 8-9 jiao, with most reaching new high prices. The total transaction volume was 4,800,004 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot goods and 1.23 million in one-month salt tax futures, 850,000 in consolidated tax, 750,000 in troop reduction, and the rest ranging from over 100,000 to 3-400,000. The total for all six was only 88,000, and 18 Customs was only 11,000. Starting today, trading in May futures will be added, it is said.</p>

<p>New China Foreign Firm reports that on Monday (the 27th), the New York stock market became increasingly sluggish, with trading volume at its lowest level this year. Total trading volume for the day was 490,000 shares. Initially, Southern New England Telephone Company reduced its dividend from $8 to $6, leading to widespread belief that American Telephone and Telegraph Company would also reduce its dividend, resulting in its stock price falling to a new low of $90 this year. The entire market was affected. Before the closing, prices recovered slightly due to strong wheat prices. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market remains weak, but the decline has slowed slightly. Due to several days of consecutive declines, profit-takers are covering their positions, and there are fewer new sellers. Therefore, the market may stabilize somewhat, but actual demand is extremely sluggish. All syndicates lack vitality. It is reported that only 250 bales were bought by all parties throughout the day. This situation indicates that the yarn market is still unlikely to improve.</p>

<p>The opening of the Renbiao [market] this morning was still weak, and the drop in U.S. cotton by 20 points per pound made it even more difficult for scattered short sellers to remain calm. Prices for all months dropped by 2, 3, and 5 qian. The afternoon saw an even weaker market due to the large drop in raw cotton. This month, being the last day, saw a drop of 7 qian alone, with distant months dropping 2 to 5 qian. The final price for this month was 32 taels and 9 qian, 5 taels and 2 qian lower than February. The total trading volume for the day was 51,200 bales. It was found that Yiyi sold 1,450 bales, Dafeng 2,050 bales, Mingde 1,050 bales, Yuande 1,450 bales, Renfeng 1,250 bales, Changfeng 2,450 bales, and Xiesheng 1,250 bales.

<p>The cotton market is experiencing an intensifying downward trend due to the sudden drop in U.S. and Indian cotton prices. There is concern that the downward trend will continue. Indian cotton is being aggressively sold in the market at particularly low prices. It is rumored that Shenxin Factory has imported 6-7,000 pieces (each piece containing 588 catties). This has caused agitation in the market, and scattered short sellers are showing signs of panic. Furthermore, several large traders have unwound their positions. However, buyers remain hesitant, and the amount being absorbed is not yet sufficient to cause extreme panic in the market. Nevertheless, based on global trends, a sharp drop in cotton prices is inevitable.</p>

<p>The opening of the Zheng Biao [market] this morning was weak due to the drop in U.S. cotton prices. Prices for all months dropped by 2 and 4 qian. In the afternoon, there were reports of large-scale Indian cotton sales, causing prices for all months to drop by another 2.5 to 1 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 129,200 dan.

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, only shipments numbered 10-20 arrived. City and rural shops have a small amount in stock. Due to the scarcity of arrivals, the market suddenly saw improvement. Sutung and Nangang rice prices were higher by 1 jiao. Wholesale purchases amounted to 7-800 stones. With strict [?] purchases, although Qingjiao and Songjiang rice arrivals were scarce, the market remained stable. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan prices were slightly 3-5 fen higher. [?] prices too.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over 30 shipments arrived from the River Down region. White kernel rice was selling well, high-grade material was stable, and mid-to-low grade was moving. Market conditions also saw high-grade material stable, while mid-to-low grade tightened recently. Poor quality early rice was not favored, and prices were slightly less than 1 jiao. Early rice showed slight weakness. Sheep Du Bu and Ke Jian remained soft. Yin Yuan was stable and fair, while white Yuan was slightly 1 jiao lower.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice, after brisk sales of Fujian rice the previous day, saw the market stabilize. Furthermore, Fujian buyers were very eager and needed to continue purchasing. Therefore, despite the decline in various River Down rice prices, Ke Xian market prices were able to hold up. Yesterday, shipments were cut off, and Fujian sales remained active, with prices even rebounding 3-5 fen. It is reported that 600 bags of Hunan mechanical red rice were offered, priced at $8.15 to $7.10. No spot foreign rice was offered. For futures, both near-term and immediate loading saw foreign merchants soliciting, with Fuka Taihe and other foreign firms being very active. However, local Ke Xian and River Down Jjian rice merchants were still observing due to the influx of Ke Xian and River Down rice.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Dumping</p>
<h3 id="e198">Wheat Flour Futures Report Declines for Days <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months declined uniformly. Foreign wheat quotations decreased by a small 2-3 jiao. Furthermore, current wheat arrivals are exceptionally abundant. Merchants have already transferred most of their imports to warehouses, and factories have a steady supply, with no fear of shortages. Spot foreign wheat prices are also becoming increasingly lenient. Activity is low at both the Canada and Australia locations. Argentina and New Zealand have also begun dumping, so the future outcome is increasingly pessimistic. April decreased by 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon. May and June were not traded. July decreased by 3 fen. August saw an even more pronounced decline, falling 5 fen. However, Hankou merchants were engaged in covering their positions. Spot wheat is arriving in small amounts. It is reported that 400 bags of Shaoxing wheat arrived, priced at 3 taels, 1 mace, and 9 fen, and were purchased by Huafeng, it is said.</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, market conditions for all months were generally flat and weak. Foreign wheat quotations decreased by around 2-3 jiao. There are still quite a few floating chips on the exchange. Given this environment, everyone is gradually selling off their holdings. (However, the standards for military vessel [flour] have been settled, and spot goods opened at 1 tael, 7 mace, and 3 fen.) There is certainly a reason why confidence is difficult to restore. By the time the afternoon market opened, market conditions for all months were again unfavorable, especially for near-term months, which were even softer. Due to the approaching delivery date for this month, outside short sellers were selling off their holdings, coupled with sluggish actual sales, making the situation particularly unfavorable. As for distant months, the bidding prices for spot foreign wheat are becoming increasingly lenient. Argentine No. 3 is only quoted at 3 taels and 1 qian, and New Zealand wheat is quoted at 3 taels, 2 mace, and 9.5 fen. Therefore, confidence is becoming increasingly fragile. As a result, this month fell by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, April and May fell by 7 li and 5 hao, June and July fell by 6 fen, and August fell by 7 li and 5 hao, it is said.</p>

<p>(Soybean Oil) Yesterday, the market in Dalian declined, causing confidence to weaken. Buyers became more active in their thinking. 2,000 pieces of Dalian oil were sold, priced at 10 taels and 5 qian. Qidou oil initially opened at 10 taels and 3 qian for 400 pieces, but due to insufficient allocation, another 500 pieces were sold, with the price rising slightly by 5 fen. Factory soybean oil traded 150 pieces at [?] 13 taels and 5 fen, a [?] compared to the previous market, [?] both down 4 qian [?]. [Soybean [?]] Shape slightly soft. Dalian cake was slightly lower by 1 fen compared to the previous market. There were few actual sales. Inland [buyers] purchased 2,000 pieces of [?] cake, priced at 1 tael, 3 mace, and 6 [?], while exporters remained cautious.</p>
<p>(Vehicular Beans) High grade was stable and low grade was weak. Factory sales saw some transactions. Dudou and Sha Huang [?] were selling continuously, but the market was declining.</p>
<p>(Mung Beans) Temporarily stable. Reduced purchases were made because of the small market in Guangdong. The market took over 400 bags of Jiangbei flour mung beans from Yantai at a price of 3 taels and 3 fen. The market price for high and medium grades was still stable, while small grades remained stagnant and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively stable as there was no change in the target gold exchange rate.

However, the market for domestic Qing Red and White sugar was tight. Guangdong trading houses offered over 1,000 bags of Hainan Red, priced at 10 taels and 2 qian, 2 qian higher than the previous day. They also offered 3-400 bags of Haibei Japanese sugar at 13 taels and 9 qian. Zhu Qing also offered a small amount, priced at 8 taels and 1 qian, which later tightened to 8 taels and half a qian. Judging from the market outlook, further increases are expected today.</p>

<p>Quanzhou bubble circles [sea snails], due to a slight increase in recent arrivals by ship and a decrease in sales, have seen stagnant inventory and slightly loosened quotations. Medium and lower grade goods have seen some transactions in recent days, with prices decreasing by several qian compared to before.

<h3 id="e204">Mussolini Apologizes to a Young Friend <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The world-renowned Italian Premier Mussolini, wrote a letter to a Swiss child scolding him: Why has there been no news to this day about the hand organ purchased from a certain Italian factory? Mr. Mussolini did not hesitate to humble himself and write a personal letter of apology, stating that the factory had gone bankrupt, causing the young friend to hope; he specially sent a hand organ as a token of apology and asked the young friend to forgive the delay, and so on. The Swiss child would be mischievous and did not complain to the factory owner for failing to buy the hand organ, but asked the prime minister about it. If according to the officialdom customs of the East, it would have been ignored long ago; or, write a sentence: No need to bother. Or, write a sentence: Let the children negotiate with the factory themselves. Below this is not this comment, it must be this decree, if it is not written on a pink card, it must be pasted on the front wall. If you want to teach him to apologize to the children in writing, it is like hanging a fish on his nose, forget about it.</p>
<p>Mr. [Mussolini] is willing to apologize to a young friend, after all, he is a premier with "tolerance." But, when Mr. Mussolini was a child himself, he was also a mischievous child. He was short in stature as a child, and his eyes were full of sharp energy. When he was twelve or thirteen years old and was ordered by his father to go to the provincial capital, a classmate insulted him, and he pulled out his small pocket knife to stab his first enemy. Mr. Mussolini was so strict with children in his childhood, but so humble with children as premier. This is a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>In the 1919 Italian election, the Socialist Party rose to prominence, and Mussolini's Fascists were defeated. The Socialist Party triumphantly paraded through the city, shouting "Death to Mussolini" under the banners flying. Mussolini, sitting in the offices of the People's Daily, pointed to the pistol on the desk and said to the editor, "Aren't they just a bunch of blind thugs under their banners? If they come here, I will kill them, I'm just afraid they don't have the courage." Mussolini refused to show weakness to the shouts of the Socialist Party in his disappointment, but Mussolini was willing to plead guilty to the accusations of children in his success. This is another question worth discussing.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Essence of General Qi's Courage Training <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The other day, I happened to flip through Qi Jiguang's book "Record of Practical Training of Soldiers", which contained "First, train soldiers; second, train courage; third, train ears and eyes; fourth, train hands and feet; fifth, train camps and formations; sixth, train generals." These six training methods are certainly not suitable for the current enemy's strong army and sophisticated equipment. But speaking of "training courage", I think it is the same from ancient times to the present, and it is worth putting forward for the main leaders who hold military power and lead the war of resistance against Japan to choose from. It is also a very good commentary.</p>
<p>What is "training courage" for? In the past, military equipment only included bows, arrows, shields, spears, halberds, axes, and huge swords. Now, in addition to guns and cannons, airplanes are used for bombing. When the rumbling sound is overhead and the soldiers standing on the front line encounter missiles raining down and flames clouding over, they will instantly become a pile of ruins, even if they are hiding in deep trenches and high fortresses. May I ask if the life and death of the front-line troops can be determined in an instant? Therefore, at this time, they must still be ordered to charge desperately, like an "resolutely fearless, as safe as walking on flat ground", so that they will not "shudder without being cold and collapse without fighting". How can they do it? Tang Yulin's abandonment of the city and escape is the most recent example. Others say that he sold out the country after receiving bribes, resulting in the loss of the army and the loss of territory. In fact, relying on an isolated city, even with natural dangers, he did not have the "courage" to defend it. It is heard that his troops, who were the last to escape, were also killed by enemy soldiers, and the bullets entered from behind. Isn't this evidence of cowardice and retreat?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that Qi Jiguang's "Record of Practical Training of Soldiers" is indeed a valuable military book, but training soldiers, of course, should take "training courage" as the first priority. Furthermore, if the soldiers' courage has been strengthened, but the generals' courage has not been trained, it is still useless. Why? The general in command of the army must go to the front line to command. If, when fighting with the enemy, he hears the sound of guns and cannons, which is louder than thunder, he will cover his ears and flee. Even if he advances, he will turn around and avoid it when he sees that the place reached by the artillery fire has become a bloody road. I am afraid that his expression will change and his behavior will inevitably be in a panic. At this point, the generals are like this, can the soldiers still fight to the death and fight the enemy to the death? Training soldiers requires "training courage", and training generals also requires "training courage". When Qi Jiguang of the Ming Dynasty was able to resist Japan and dare not invade our Central Plains, and the Qi family army and the Yue family army shone in succession, it was precisely because of this. I hope that those in charge of military administration now also adopt this essence to revitalize the declining morale.</p>
<h3 id="e206">When the Swallows Fly to Jiangnan <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Ming</p>
<p>Ou Yangxieu's swallow poem has two lines: "Always towards spring and autumn club before and after, for whom to return and for whom to come." Now that the spring breeze is clear and warm, and the countryside is full of flowers, it is already the Cold Food Festival, when the swallows start from the warm land and fly to Jiangnan.</p>
<p>We see each other only once a year. Although we don't understand what they are murmuring, we always feel that this sound is very familiar and very beautiful. When I was a child, I lived in a small village on the coast of the East China Sea. Three or five swallow nests were arranged on the beams of a tile house. From the time the autumn wind rises and the swallows return to the south, I feel lonely, until in mid-spring, when the peach blossoms in Jiangnan are about to bloom and the rape flowers are in full bloom, they will fly in groups as usual and live with us. Every morning, they chirp happily, waking me up from my dream, and I immediately get up, stand in the sunlight to watch them fly, and listen to their whispers. At noon, facing the river, I also appreciate them busily weaving in the blue water shadow like shuttles. Two spring petals fall on their black scissor wings. As long as they turn over their snow-egg-like belly, like magic, the fallen flowers fly open, and they slip across the water and disappear into the willows. In the evening, watching the old swallows bring things back, I once wrote a short poem:</p>
<p>"Eaves hovering, flying near the nest then turning back. Inducing all the chicks to stick out their heads, remotely gazing at their foraging mother returning." This mood of village life cannot be recovered now. I seem to be sitting in this ruined city of Shanghai, without seeing peach blossoms or swallows.</p>
<p>However, the swallow nests in the market have been trafficked from the villages of my hometown to Shanghai [?] I am stirring up my homesickness with a pale heart, and I cherish the death of my youth even more. Ah, swallow! Just like you, I am flying back and forth in the whirlpool of life in a hurry, and I am also wasting my dreamlike hopes. But what is the point? Like you, I no longer have a home!</p>

<p>— Zhou Jingzhi</p>
<p>This is how Bai Wei and Ms. Qin Xiang started their acquaintance: One morning, bathed in the allure of spring, Bai Wei, having no classes at school, planned to visit his close friend, Lao Chen, at Xiushan Park. When he stepped into Lao Chen's room, he found two young and beautiful ladies. One was Lao Chen's wife, Ms. C, whom he had known for a long time. The other, however, was someone he had never met. "Is Lao Chen not at home?"</p>
<p>"He hasn't returned since last night. Ah, let me introduce you. This is Comrade Bai Wei, a person of great renown in literary circles. This is Ms. Qin Xiang, a highly celebrated socialite, the 'Empress of Shanghai.'"</p>
<p>"I have long admired you, your name precedes you like thunder." And with that, they understood each other tacitly.</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>A week later, their footprints were already on the dance floor, they were seen wandering in the park day and night, their emotions were blazing, and they were busy renting a house and buying furniture, hastily building a small family to live out their monotonous lives.</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>Another week later, their emotions cooled, because their personalities clashed, leading to frequent disagreements, making it difficult to continue living together. Eventually, they hired a lawyer and declared bankruptcy and divorce. This young couple, from meeting to divorce, took only a month. In this great China, where everyone is chanting "Crash Course ××" and "Crash Course ××," they can be considered to have deeply understood the essence of it all, the elite of the crash course.</p>
<p>A Long Novel</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Finally Bearing the Heart to Untie the Bell, He Enters the Door; Mistakenly Pities the Maiden and Wishes to Share Her Food</p>
<p>Therefore, without hesitation, he went straight to the Yang family. Reaching the outer room, he first called out with a smile, "Old Madame!" He always greeted her this way. This call of "Old Madame" was not a respectful address, but merely a telegram from an old maid, telling her, "I have arrived." After each such greeting, Gui Zhi would invariably come out silently, nodding and smiling. Without saying "Welcome," the full extent of her warm welcome was naturally expressed without any reservation. But today, after this call of "Old Madame," the situation changed drastically. From inside the room, someone asked sternly, "Who is it?" This "Who?" was called out by Gui Zhi. Given how well he and Gui Zhi knew each other, would Gui Zhi not recognize his voice? Moreover, this "Who?" was asked with great emphasis, not at all like a casual inquiry. This was quite strange, why was it so? This was a representation never before seen since they knew each other! Just as he was puzzling over this, Jiang said from inside, "Is it Second Master Gan? Please come in." Ji Zhi responded and walked in, only to see the old maid sitting on the kang with her head lowered, her eyes red. Jiang stood up to greet him, smiling, "Second Master, did our girl offend someone in your household?" Upon hearing this, Ji Zhi knew that something had happened, and his face reddened as well, but he deliberately calmed himself and feigned ignorance, asking, "What makes you say that?" Jiang said, "Today…" Gui Zhi, looking upset, repeatedly tugged at her mother's clothes, pouting, "Why are you saying so much? Don't say it, don't say it!" Jiang said, "Second Master hasn't offended you, why can't we say it? Even if Second Master has offended you, we still have to ask for a clear explanation." Hearing her mother explain it this way, Gui Zhi lowered her head and remained silent. Jiang smiled, "Second Master, don't take it to heart. We are poor people, and orphans and widows at that, how dare we argue with anyone? But we have to make things clear. We may be poor, but we are an honest family. Although we make some clothes for your household to make a living, that is our duty. If your household says that my daughter and I don't do a good job, then you can just stop having us make clothes. But we haven't done anything wrong. Today, my girl went to your household, intending to ask the Madam if the clothes made by Second Master fit well or not. This is just her being overly attentive."

<p>Whereabouts</p>
<h3 id="e210">A Small Record of Travels To and From Xinshu <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding</p>
<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>Xinshu is another name for Xinshi, and it also has a name called "Xiantan" (Fairy Pool). In the Xinshi Town Gazetteer, there are many records of mythological legends. I will not mention it now and leave it for another time. Xinshi is the largest town under the jurisdiction of Deqing County in Zhejiang Province, and its customs and people are excellent models. The famous painter Shen Quan, also known as Nanping, of the Qing Dynasty, was also from Xinshi!</p>
<p>I went to Xinshi when I was three years old, so Xinshi is also my second hometown, and my relationship with it is very close. What I can't forget about Xinshi is the Lion Peak on Guoshan outside Nan Zha, also known as Jiashan (Fake Mountain), the Beauty Stone, and Taoyuan (Peach Blossom Spring). And the two Great Vajras of Juehai Temple in the center of the town. (See details below.)</p>
<p>The Lion Peak of Guoshan is a lion-shaped rock, with its head raised towards the east, mouth open and eyes glaring. When you look at it in the morning, it seems as if it wants to swallow the bright red sun in one gulp. Its posture is majestic and its spirit is uplifting, but the idle class who are generally indifferent will certainly not think of these things. The Beauty Stone is also almost there, with a graceful demeanor, as if Xishi (a famous beauty in ancient China) is slowly coming. Taoyuan Cave is a few steps further, and it is a stone cave about eight feet wide, with a flat stone slab on top and soft green grass around it. However, it is said that there are ghosts below, so no one has ever ventured down to this day. The two Great Vajras of Juehai Temple were made by a certain doctor Li near Xinshi. He was also in high spirits and joked with the famous craftsmen from Jiangxi (Jiangxi has famous sculptors. When Xinshi was building Juehai Temple, they went to invite several to sculpt the Four Great Vajras). During the sculpting process, both sides kept secrets, surrounding the area with dense bamboo fences to prevent anyone from seeing it. On the day the great work was completed, the bamboo fences were removed, and everyone admired it. Who knew that the Jiangxi masters, whom the people of Xinshi usually worshiped, had completely collapsed, while the unknown Li was praised by the public. It turned out that what he sculpted was full of spirit and lifelike, while what the Jiangxi people sculpted was ordinary and sleepy. So these few things can occupy my mind.</p>
<p>(Part 2)</p>
<p>My second hometown, for a cost of less than three yuan, is now before my eyes, and the tall Buyun Bridge is still intact. But everything else shows a very sad image. Last year, the farmers had a bumper harvest of all grains, and their hearts were so open and their families were so happy. Who knew that all places had bumper harvests, and everyone couldn't sell their crops for a good price. So a new term was created: "Cheap grain hurts farmers." Xinshi also felt the economic downturn due to "cheap grain hurting farmers." Usually, the people in the town cursed the people in the countryside, but now they have no reason to curse. It is said that:</p>
<p>"Two South Goods stores, two silk stores, one dim sum shop, and one teahouse... have all announced the cessation of business!"</p>
<p>If you walk on the street, you will feel like you are in a "dead city," but I know deeply that this is a universal phenomenon, not just Xinshi.</p>
<p>The Lion Peak in front of Guoshan is still raising its head to swallow the sun, the Beauty Stone is still slender in attitude, and Taoyuan Cave is still the same; but the two Great Vajras of Juehai Temple have more traces of peeling, like the scars of our Northeast.</p>
<p>The people of Xinshi are patriotic and do not want to lag behind. In a few days, there will be a drama to raise funds for "National Salvation Through Aviation." It is said that it will not be officially implemented until after the traditional opera performance at the beginning of the third lunar month. "National Salvation Through Aviation" is the highest method of saving the country. It is expected that many people in Xinshi will open their wallets to go there!</p>
<p>On the evening of the 22nd, it was said that the small steamer from Hangzhou to Xin was robbed, and one passenger was injured. This is also an important issue that researchers of social problems need to study urgently.</p>
<p>The injury on my right hand, , hurts, cannot move, and is ice-cold. Thanks to my friend Mr. Gu's one or two injections, it gradually loosened. It was really only three days! I was able to hold a pen a little. So I hurried to Shanghai.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Before the Central Political Conference on the morning of the 29th, central figures unanimously urged Wang to return to his post.

<p>(Nanjing) After the Central Political Conference on the morning of the 29th, central figures held important meetings in the political conference one after another. Over thirty people attended, including Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Chen Gongbo, Gu Tingyu, Luo Wengan, Chen Shaokuan, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Shuren, and He Yaozu, discussing important issues such as military affairs and diplomacy. Foreign Minister Luo also reported on the diplomatic situation, and the meeting adjourned at noon. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference held its 350th meeting on the 29th, attended by Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Zhaoming, Lin Sen, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Gu Mengyu, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Li Liejun, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, Zhu Peide, Kong Xiangxi, Zhang Qun, Ma Chaojun, Gu Zhutong, Chen Bulei, Jing Hengyi, Shi Ying, Shi Qingyang, Chen Ce, Tang Shengzhi, He Yaozu, Wu Tiecheng, Jiang Zuobin, Zhou FoHai, Zeng Zhongming, Duan Xipeng, Huang Fusheng, Liang Hancao, Shao Lizi, Jiao Yitang, Li Ciwen, Huang Jichen, Zhou Qigang, Chen Zhaoying, Chen Shuren, Ding Chaowu, Wang Qi, Zhang Daofan, Mao Zuquan, Yu Jingtang, Tang Youren, Wang Luyi, Xiao Jishan, Gu Zhenggang, Bai Yunti, Hong Ludong, Deng Jiayan and other fifty plus people, chaired by Ye Chu Cang.

(3) The proposal to temporarily terminate the Capital Construction Committee and transfer its operating expenses to fund the construction of elementary schools in the capital was approved. The meeting adjourned at 9:45 a.m. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Conference had a lengthy discussion on the military unification plan proposed by Yu Youren and Sun Ke and reached a substantial decision. Its principles cannot be released due to military relations. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei said that the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan was brought up for discussion at today's Central Political Conference. The members all recommended that he return to his post. Although he declined repeatedly, he could not insist because the members were determined to refuse. He agreed to continue to maintain his position and will go to the Yuan to cancel his leave and take up his duties after the Standing Committee passes it on the 30th. He originally planned to go north to visit the troops after returning to China, but because he was not fully recovered from his illness, and because of the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan, all parties wanted him to return to his post, so he could not make the trip in the near future. After he is slightly recovered from his illness and has slightly sorted out the affairs of the Yuan, he will make the trip. In recent days, he has repeatedly received telegrams from Minister He and others, stating that our army has repeatedly defeated the enemy's vanguard in the anti-Japanese war, so he is very pleased even though he is not going. However, in external operations, the military and the entire country must be united to rise up and seek meritorious service in order to achieve the most victorious goal. As for the military expenses of the North China armies, he plans to discuss the organization method with Chairman Chiang to ensure that the military's heart is set and that the people are not harmed in the slightest, so that military-civilian cooperation can achieve great benefits. The committee unanimously decided to submit Commissioner Li Liejun's proposal to open up the government to the Central Standing Committee for discussion on the 30th. The principles of this case are the same as those of the National Political Participation Council, that is, to implement Sun Yat-sen's doctrine of people's rights, so that the people of the whole country can participate in politics as a precursor to promoting constitutionalism and a foundation for implementing democratic politics, so all the members of the Central Committee are quite supportive. There will be a great discussion at tomorrow's Central Standing Committee. In order to concentrate anti-Japanese forces, the Central Committee asked Comrade Feng Huanzhang to come to Beijing to discuss major plans, but according to his telegram, it is inconvenient to leave Zhangjiakou for the time being, so the date of his trip south has not yet been determined.

<h3 id="e219">The League of Nations Advisory Committee Met Yesterday <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The American Representative From 21 Countries in Attendance Remained Silent Throughout</p>
<p>It Was Resolved That It Was Not Necessary to Respond to Japan's Withdrawal From the League</p>
<p>The Report on the Non-Recognition of the Puppet State Was Submitted to the Subcommittee for Study</p>
<p>The Opinions of Various Countries on the Arms Embargo Were Not Entirely Consistent</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee Adjourned Until After Easter</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee of the League of Nations, organized to monitor the Sino-Japanese dispute, has now read Japan's notice of withdrawal from the League of Nations and Secretary-General Drummond's reply. The Advisory Committee has not yet decided to issue a new statement criticizing Japan's views in the Japanese notification. However, the Committee intends to quickly study the various issues arising from the non-recognition of "Manchukuo." In addition, the representatives of the various countries in the Committee will also seek the opinions of their respective governments on the layer of prohibiting arms shipments to belligerent countries. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>The various issues arising from the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" include "Manchukuo's" request to join the International Postal and Telegraph Union, and the status of local officials to consuls stationed in Manchuria.</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Advisory Committee met at 5:30 PM tonight and adjourned at 7:15 PM. At the time of adjournment, the date of the next meeting had not been decided. However, it is unlikely that it will meet again before Easter. The Advisory Committee discussed the general situation arising from Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, but decided that no reply was necessary. Irish Representative Lester first raised the issue of Japan's withdrawal, saying that he knew this matter was only indirectly related to the Advisory Committee, but he felt that the Advisory Committee might as well take a stand and respond to Japan's notice of withdrawal. The reply should point out that Japan has the right to know how to interpret international treaties regarding Japan's relations with other countries and should reject it. There was some discussion on this point among the members, but it was finally decided that since the Secretariat had already replied to the various sections in the Japanese document, the Advisory Committee did not need to reply. The Advisory Committee then listened to a report by the Deputy Secretary of the League of Nations, Mr. Pirrotti, on the issue of non-recognition of "Manchukuo." The report stated what actions should be taken regarding "Manchukuo's" request to join the Postal and Telegraph Alliance, and how the "Manchukuo" stamps, coins, passports, and other items should be treated. This report is not yet complete and will be submitted to the Subcommittee on the Non-Recognition of "Manchukuo." This committee will be convened after Easter. The Advisory Committee then discussed the issue of an arms embargo in order to prepare the agenda for the Arms Embargo Committee. However, the general opinion was that the attitude of a certain great power towards this matter was still uncertain, so there was nothing that could be done about it at present. It was felt that it would be better to wait and see the results of the proposed arms embargo related to the dispute with the two South American countries. Czech Representative Gisesti (Czech Minister to Switzerland) made a very clear statement, asking about the attitude of the United States towards this matter, but U.S. Representative Wilson was present as an observer and remained silent throughout, neither participating in the discussion nor expressing the views of his government, so the date of the Arms Embargo Committee meeting has not been set, but it will probably have to wait until after Easter. Only twenty-one countries, including the United States, attended today's meeting. The Turkish representative was not present. The British representative was External Secretary Kerr, France was represented by Massigli, and Germany was represented by Kenna. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e220">Territories Under Japanese Mandate <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on the 26th that, regarding the issue of the South Pacific mandated islands after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the United States is extremely concerned due to their location and significant relationship to American naval operations in the Pacific. According to sources from Washington officials, the top leaders of the US government believe that Japan, having already withdrawn from the League of Nations, should not demand sovereignty over the mandated territories. If Japan stubbornly insists on its views, a serious protest will be lodged. The American position is that the mandated territories should be returned to the League of Nations. The territories acquired by the United States through the victory of the Allied Powers over the past decade or more were not individually ceded to the victorious nations but to the Allied Powers as a whole, and the United States naturally has a portion of the rights. Furthermore, the Secretary of State during President Wilson's era had already stated that the United States, as one of the main Allied nations, has the same concerns and inseparable interests in Germany's former overseas territories as other Allied nations. Therefore, other Allied nations also have an equal right to speak, and any disposal without the consent of the United States will be deemed invalid.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reported that Germany will begin negotiations with Japanese Ambassador to Germany Nagai regarding the South Pacific mandated territories. The preliminary talks already took place at 8:00 PM on the 24th at a certain location in Berlin. Approximately twenty figures, including Nazi Party leader and Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department Frank, Acting Foreign Minister Rosenberg, and individuals involved in German foreign relations, secretly conferred with Acting Japanese Ambassador Fujii and others. As a result, the opinion put forward by the German side stated that Germany considers the South Pacific islands to have no current economic colonial value. However, fearing that the National Socialist Party might insist on reclaiming old colonies from the past, Germany recognizes that the South Pacific islands have important military significance for Japan. Therefore, Japan can practically utilize them militarily, but formally, they can be placed under German administration.</p>

<p>The Realization of East Asian Monroe Doctrine is Not Far Off</p>
<p>(Berlin) The nationalist "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" commented on the issue of Japan and the League of Nations, believing that the League of Nations and the great powers are incapable in the Far East. Therefore, in the near future, Japan's attitude will not change in any way. The newspaper stated, "Japan's attitude will not change in any way. The newspaper stated that Japan has now withdrawn from the League of Nations, which shows that the League of Nations has no ability to maintain world peace, and Japan is unwilling to participate in the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles again. Since 1918, the Sino-Japanese issue has been the biggest dispute internationally. Since the League of Nations has no ability to resolve it, it will be impossible to make people value this kind of international organization and achieve the expected results in the future. Therefore, if the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles truly collapses and becomes a reality, we should regard Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations as the starting point of the League of Nations' bankruptcy." The newspaper also said, "The separation of Asia from Europe and the United States has long been a concern for the general public. Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, this separation has been realized. In the future, Japan will declare the Far East as its own sphere of interest and will not allow interference from other countries. This policy will definitely be realized, the only unknown thing is when. Looking at Japan's attitude towards the former German islands in the Pacific, it can be seen that the time for Japan to adopt this policy may not be far away." The newspaper also believes that, apart from the United States, no other country can prevent Japan's progress. The newspaper concluded, "From our point of view, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations can prove the League of Nations' incompetence on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can prove that only strong and resolute countries can defend themselves and survive in the daily struggles in the international arena. This is the greatest significance of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations." (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Strict Restrictions on Jewish Occupations</p>
<p>Jewish Shops Have Few Customers</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th - The government today announced a widespread boycott of Jewish occupations, as retaliation for overseas Jewish plots against Germany. The German boycott is scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM on April 1st and will be rigorously implemented by boycott committees across the country. These committees will be responsible for monitoring and punishing offenders and for protecting the personal freedom of foreigners, regardless of their race or nationality. The boycott will be publicized to the public, and German families will not subscribe to newspapers that do not join the boycott. German stores are not allowed to advertise in these newspapers. The anti-Jewish boycott committee must also be responsible for investigating Germans who have deposits abroad and should use these funds to promote the truth that Germany is currently very peaceful domestically. The committee must strictly limit the number of Jews entering universities or holding medical and legal positions, so that their total number has a certain proportion to the total German population. The declaration states that the boycott should be implemented in a normal and peaceful manner and should not harm a hair on any Jew's head. The declaration fiercely criticizes the Jews, accusing them of believing in Marxism and blaming Germany for not banning immigrants in the past fifteen years, which led to a small number of Jewish writers, university professors, and businessmen repaying kindness with hatred and inciting the world against the Germans. Some towns in Germany have already started boycotting Jewish businesses. Stormtroopers from the National Defense Party have come out to order Jewish stores to close. Jewish lawyers and doctors in the Glöglau area have been forced to stop working. Customers are being prevented from entering Jewish-owned stores in the town of Gleiwitz in Upper Silesia, so although the stores are open, there is no business all day long.</p>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese government bought 1,200 kan of gold bars, worth 11.2 million yen at market prices. The Kawasaki liner Ryoyo Maru, which departed from Kobe yesterday, is transporting them to San Francisco. This is the first shipment of gold bars this year to be sent to exchange banks to pay for overseas cash transfers without using bills of exchange. On the one hand, it aims to save overseas payments, and on the other hand, it encourages the gold production industry. However, as a result, there is a risk of increasing imports. At this time when the Exchange Control Law is in effect, it is extremely important to pay attention. According to observations from financial industry insiders, the government's transportation of cash is to prevent the exchange rate from falling and to gradually increase the US exchange rate to US$25, and then decisively implement a low parity.</p>

<p>Reuters Hollywood - A salary reduction movement for movie stars is currently underway, and the usually favorable contracts will also be revised. Stars who earn £1,600 per week and £50,000 per film, such as Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Myrna Loy, Swanson, the Marx Brothers, Ann Harding, William Powell, and George Arliss, will be greatly affected. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of the new contract discussions, as some stars who were famous on stage before are said to be considering other options. Ann Harding may appear on the British stage. Norma Shearer plans to make one film each in England and France every autumn. Her contract stipulates that she will shoot four new films in two years, two films each year, and guarantees that her salary of £200 per day will not be affected in any way. It is quite difficult to know what Garbo's plans are. Arliss will return to England for recuperation, or will reappear on the stage, is yet to be decided. Colman plans to return to England to live his bachelor life, but his contract stipulates that he must return to the United States within one year, or notify in advance, otherwise the contract will be cancelled. Swanson may organize her own independent film company or sign a contract with two or three major film companies. William Powell and Claudette Colbert will continue their screen careers, but they firmly oppose salary cuts. After the salary cuts, Powell's weekly income will be reduced to £1,600, and Colbert's will be reduced to £1,500.</p>

We feel stimulated in spirit, especially at this time of serious national crisis. The country's territory has been taken away, and the country's position is extremely precarious. We should commemorate the glorious deeds of the revolutionary martyrs of the past, continue to implement the unfinished will of the martyrs, recover the lost territories in the Northeast externally, and eliminate the communist bandits internally. With the spirit of struggle and sacrifice of the martyrs, and the determination to resist for a long time, the violent Japanese will eventually be subdued. (1) Recognize that the martyrs were young patriots and pillars of the country, which is the country's greatest loss. (2) Recognize that the martyrs' revolutionary actions were the inspiration of the Three Principles of the People, which generated national spirit and created glorious deeds. (3) Recognize that the success of the Xinhai Revolution was due to the determination of the past ten revolutions, unity, and common commitment to national crisis. Then, our Northeast will be recovered one day, and the national humiliation can be avenged." The meeting did not end until 12:00 noon.</p>

<p>Song Ziwen Returns to Shanghai This Morning</p>
<h3 id="e255">It is Not a Problem for Dean Wang to Resume Office <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement Expires and is Abolished</p>
<p>Unification of Currency and Reorganization of Various Taxes</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, left Nanjing on the overnight express train last night and returned to Shanghai at approximately 8:00 AM this morning. Reporters from various newspapers called on Mr. Song at his private residence this morning. According to Mr. Song's statement, the issue of Wang Jingwei's return to the position of President of the Executive Yuan can be formally resumed after a decision is made by the Central Political Council this morning. The following is a record of Mr. Song's remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e256">Wang Will Immediately Resume Office <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song stated that there is absolutely no problem with Mr. Wang's return to the position of President of the Executive Yuan. He will formally resume his position after the Central Political Council resolves this issue this morning and will be fully responsible for politics thereafter. He himself will focus on finance. Therefore, what I can discuss with you gentlemen is limited to financial matters. Although I still hold the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan, the Vice President does not have the authority to make statements related to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Jiang to Come to Shanghai News <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired whether the news that Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, was about to come to Shanghai was accurate. Mr. Song did not give a definite answer, only saying that he had seen this item recorded in the newspapers, but he did not deny it either. It is said that Chiang will come to Shanghai within a day or two after attending today's Central Political Council meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Unify Subsidiary Currency <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Song also stated that various commercial organizations have requested the unification of subsidiary currency, and this matter can be done. In addition to copper and silver subsidiary currencies, our country currently does not have nickel coins. Nickel coins are more difficult to imitate. Most countries often use these nickel coins to transform armaments, such as bullet heads, etc., during emergencies, and the supply of raw materials is difficult. As for implementing the gold standard, it is also difficult because countries that implement the gold standard buy silver with gold, which is cheaper, while countries that do not use the gold standard find it extremely difficult to buy gold with silver. Whether the World Economic Conference will be held in May has not yet been decided, so it is not yet possible to predict whether I will go to Europe to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Tariff Agreement <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese tariff agreement will expire and become invalid after May 16. There is no question of whether it will be renewed, because the agreement only stipulates that the import tax on certain goods will be maintained for one and three years. Initially, because our country signed an agreement on tariff autonomy with various countries, Japan could not be an exception, so it maintained its minimum tariff rate, hence this provision.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Reorganize Tax Revenue <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of tax revenue, there is no problem in North China since it belongs to the central government, and there is also no problem in South China. Song explained that the "unification" of tax revenue does not mean that it is considered unified only if the central government sends people to handle tax collection. In general, anything that can be handled according to the methods of the central government is also called unified. Therefore, the central government strives to simplify the reorganization of tax revenue as much as possible. As for the reorganization of salt tax, the situation is also better now than before.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Liao Chengzhi Arrested Yesterday <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Confessed to being the Son of Martyr Zhongkai</p>
<p>He Xiangning Cables for Rescue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau’s Inspectorate arrested Wang Qiliang, a native of Shaoxing and Secretary-General of the Communist Party's National Federation of Trade Unions, on Gonghe Road in Zhabei yesterday morning. According to Wang, a meeting was to be held at 2:00 PM that afternoon at No. 9 Wufu Lane, Shanxi Road, in the Public Concession. The Inspectorate then ordered a number of detectives to escort Wang to the Laozao Police Station to request assistance. The head of the station ordered Chinese detectives Gao Yuke and others to go to the address, where they arrested Luo Dengxian (also known as He Yongzhu) from Fujian, Yu Wenhua from Henan, and Liao Chengzhi from Guangdong in the eastern temple room of the house. At the same time, the detectives found that the middle floor of the house was an opium den, so they brought back Yuan Jingeng from Changzhou, who ran the opium den, as well as opium smokers Kai Ronggui, Ni Yaoxian, Zhou Haishan, Li Wansan, Zong Dongfa, Jiang Yongqiao, Fan Zhensheng, the woman You Qiusheng, Yao Yinsheng, and others to the police station. According to Liao Chengzhi, his father was the martyr Liao Zhongkai, and his mother is the current Central Committee member He Xiangning. He denied joining the Communist Party or holding any position. This morning, the police station sent the opium case criminals to the First Special District Court for separate penalties, and sent Luo, Yu, and Liao to the Second High Branch Court, where Judge Yu convened a collegiate panel for interrogation. The defendants all denied the charges, and the Public Security Bureau brought Wang Qiliang to the case to prove that Luo Dengxian was the Secretary of the National Federation of Trade Unions of his party, Yu Wenhua was the secretary, and Liao Chengzhi was the secretary of the Seamen’s Union. The police station's lawyer, Gan Jingxian, requested a postponement because the police station still needed to investigate whether the three defendants had committed any crimes and requested that the defendants be temporarily detained. Judge Yu approved this and ordered that the hearing be postponed to the afternoon of the 31st.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that Liao Chengzhi, the son of Kuomintang elder Liao Zhongkai, is 26 years old, studied economics in Germany for 17 years, and returned to Shanghai two weeks ago. He was suddenly arrested by the Laozao Police Station at No. 8 Wufu Lane, Shanxi Road, yesterday. The reporter visited Liao's mother, Ms. He Xiangning, this morning to inquire about the details. According to her, her son Chengzhi suddenly returned to the country two weeks ago. I asked him why he returned, and he replied that the country's affairs are like this, and studying is also useless. He went out yesterday and did not know why he was arrested. I didn't know about the arrest until 11 o'clock last night, when my son was escorted by five foreign constables and two Chinese police to my house and left. As for the reason for the arrest, I still don't know. But I won't post bail and will see how it goes. He cried sadly, his concern for his son was truly infinitely painful. Now that the police station has transferred the case to the court, he intends to hire lawyer Wu Kaisheng to defend him. On one hand, He's secretary has drafted a telegram and sent it to various important figures in the central government. The telegram reads: "To all national political and military leaders, my son Chengzhi was arrested by the foreign police in Shanghai last night, but I don't know where he is being held. I am willing to stay in prison with my son, but I do not want to stay in a foreign prison. I request that he be sent to the Chinese territory, even if it means death, I would be willing. In Chinese territory, not in the concession, please investigate and reply."</p>

<p>Currently Verifying Postage Standards with the Post Office</p>
<p>The Lorraine-style amphibious aircraft newly purchased by China Aviation Corporation was shipped to Shanghai on the President Pierce mail ship a few days ago. The company immediately retrieved it from the customs and temporarily placed it in the warehouse at the Dalai Wharf. This morning, the company's aviation department sent technician Huerke to assemble the fuselage and hired a steamer to tow it to Longhua Airport for the installation of the engine and parts and test flights at the airfield. Its designation has not yet been determined. In addition, in order to verify postage standards, the company has been sending staff member Cai Guangmo to the post office since the 13th of this month to jointly count the total number of daily mail items, with the average number for two weeks serving as the standard. It is now known that the results of the inspection show that the previously determined standard of 21 yuan per kilogram for the first zone and 41 yuan per kilogram for the second zone paid by the post office is still fair. Whether it will be revised again will require consultations between the two parties. As for the average number of mail items, the first postal zone is 1,681 items, with a postal income of 420 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen, with the most being sent to Hankou. The second postal zone is 535 items, with a postal income of 267 yuan and 5 jiao, with the most being sent to Chongqing. The average daily postal income for the two zones is about 700 yuan. Although it is not enough to cover expenses, a surplus can be expected if passenger traffic increases.</p>

According to him, the unrest in Xinjiang Province was only received by telegram, and it is now heard that the situation there is not as serious as the telegrams indicated. Therefore, it is scheduled to fly to inspect the truth next Tuesday (April 4).</p>
<p>Sino-German Joint Steel Plant</p>
<h3 id="e266">Loan Contract Signature Pending <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>RMB 100 Million Guarantee Undetermined</p>
<p>Decided to Conduct Exploration of Mineral Resources First</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and the German Hope Company are conducting a Sino-German joint venture steel plant, with the German side borrowing funds to serve as the plant's capital. It is said that the draft contract has been signed by Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, and the German representative. The reporter from Xinsheng News Agency has learned the following details:</p>
<p>Borrowing RMB 100 Million It is said that the contract content is that the Sino-German joint venture steel plant will borrow a huge amount of US$25 million (one saying US$26 million) from Germany, calculated at 4 yuan per US dollar, reaching RMB 100 million, which is one of the largest amounts of foreign loans ever made by the government. In addition to China supplying its own raw materials, the rest will be supplied by Germany, and the purchase price will be converted into loans. However, the German side is now asking us for a guarantee, and the Ministry is currently requesting instructions from the government. The draft was signed two weeks ago, and it was decided to carry out mineral exploration work within three months of signing. If the coal mine resources are abundant and can be used for smelting, the contract can be signed. Otherwise, another method will be found to supply coal for fuel, and the signature will be made after proper arrangements.</p>
<p>Decided to Conduct Mineral Exploration First China and Germany have now decided to conduct mineral exploration work first to test whether the Lei Jiagou mineral resources in Anhui are abundant and can be used. This cost will be 100,000 yuan, which will be borne by the Hope Company, and our side will give five promissory notes worth 20,000 yuan each. If the Lei Jiagou coal mine is not suitable, another site will be found for the plant. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance are determined, but the complete establishment of the plant will take five or six years.</p>

<p>Unemployed Workers Petition Party and Government Agencies</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that the reeling room of the Jardine Matheson Spinning Mill, a British-owned company in Yangshupu, employs more than 340 male and female workers. It normally operates day and night shifts. Over the years, the workers have taken the overall situation into consideration and have not bothered to argue with the factory. The factory suddenly shut down the entire department the day before yesterday (the 27th). The workers demanded that only the day shift be opened to maintain the workers' livelihoods, but the factory manager ignored them. This morning at 9:00 AM, the workers sent representatives Ji Jiaan, Zhao Qingyun, Liu Jianhou, Zhao Qizi, and 15 others to party and government agencies to petition, requesting that they be stopped. The Municipal Party Department was received by Zhang Sheng, the chief of the Civil Training Section, who agreed to handle the matter jointly with the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau was received by Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Section, who agreed to investigate after asking for instructions, and then convene a mediation meeting.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Protest</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the British Malaya Peninsula has always been free to land, so overseas Chinese who want to go to the island to engage in business can land freely without being bound by any conditions. However, recently, the British government authorities, in view of the fact that overseas Chinese residing in various places in Siam in Southeast Asia are unable to withstand the severe oppression of the governments of those places and have gone to the Malay Peninsula one after another to seek a living, which has greatly affected the power of British merchants in the area, recently promulgated twelve extremely harsh rules for overseas Chinese landing. All Chinese who wish to go to the island in the future must first fulfill the above-mentioned treaties, otherwise they will be forcibly sent back to their country of origin, and they will not be allowed to land freely. It is now known that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the British government's move is completely unreasonable, so it has lodged a protest with the British government, demanding that it immediately revoke the order restricting overseas Chinese from freely landing on the Malay Peninsula in order to enhance the friendship between the two countries.</p>

<p>Two Robbers' Hearing Postponed for Seven Days</p>
<p>Ji Liren, Deputy Inspector of the Huishi Police Station, learned that there were robbers hiding in a thatched shed on Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. At 9:30 PM last night, he led Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them. Shandong native Liu Defa and Anhui native Bao Wengui were arrested on the spot. Another person surnamed Zhu escaped. Fearing that he would escape, Inspector Ji immediately fired a warning shot. Unexpectedly, the robber also had a weapon hidden on his body, so he opened fire to resist arrest, causing Inspector Ji to be shot in the neck, causing him to bleed and fall to the ground. The other detectives rescued him and sent him to the hospital for treatment. It is now heard that the progress is still good. Although the injury is not minor, it does not seem to be in great danger. Liu and Bao, who were arrested, were sent to the First Special District Court this morning along with an iron axe and two long and short bayonets found in the thatched shed. Judge Qian Wenji conducted the interrogation. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, described the case. Later, because the case involving Liu and Bao was still under investigation, he requested a postponement of one week and that the two be sent to prison pending investigation and prosecution. Judge Qian asked Liu and others a few words and then approved the police station's request to postpone the hearing for seven days. Liu and Bao were taken back to the police station for detention.

<p>Wang Heshang, a local who plays a supporting role in the Xianshi Lewei Grand Theater, specializes in luring young boys to vent his sexual desires. There are already quite a few people who have been abused by him over the years. On the 21st of this month, a 17-year-old boy named Yang Dayu from Zhenjiang came to Shanghai to look for his brother. He was met by Wang Heshang on the way. Because the boy was young and unfamiliar with the place, he could be easily fooled. So he used his eloquent tongue to lure him in every possible way, saying that since he didn't know where to find his brother, he would inevitably be homeless after a long time, and that he would find a way to recommend a job for him to avoid drifting in a foreign land. The boy was indeed deceived by him and followed him to a small inn, where he served as his apprentice during the day and indulged in fornication at night. For several days, his anus was repeatedly violated. It was not until yesterday that detectives Geng Debiao and Ma Mouxiang from the Laozao Police Station learned that Wang Heshang's actions were extremely illegal, so they immediately arrested him. According to Yang's complaint, he was deceived, and another 16-year-old boy named Sun Yunqing from Suzhou was also repeatedly sodomized by Wang. This morning, the two boys were summoned and Wang was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated him and ordered the defendant to be detained and the hearing postponed for seven days for further details. The details will be continued in tomorrow's newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e272">One Pass, Separated by Bitterness and Joy <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Shan</p>
<p>Some days ago, newspapers reported that Mr. Wang Maosheng had secretly escaped from Shenyang to Shanghai. He actually dared to imitate the tongue of important people and published a piece of news, roughly saying that the Japanese rebels subjected the 30 million compatriots in Northeast China to various cruel punishments such as rape, looting, and murder, and confiscation of property, which was enough to darken the sky and the earth. However, they treated the captured soldiers of the Volunteer Army with even more "dismemberment by five horses" and the unheard-of "hanging upside down on treetops, causing their heart blood to flow downwards until death," a slow and torturous method of killing. In the world, there are no more inhumane things that defile the history of mankind than this.</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy army's severe and cruel punishments for our Northeast compatriots and the Volunteer Army, with their barbaric bestiality, are unimaginable. There must be more than just what Mr. Wang saw and heard and dictated. Perhaps there are even more severe and cruel things than what Mr. Wang dictated. I don't know how many. However, even with the particularly cruel torture of "hanging upside down on treetops," it is enough for us to make our hair stand on end, our eyes crack, and our hearts ache. Why do I say this? When we bravely fight for national personality and national freedom, we "cut with knives" instead of "shooting," nor do we use "burning" or "burying alive," but endure the slow and poisonous torture of hanging upside down on treetops, exposing them to the summer sun or autumn sun until their skin is scorched, or drifting in the wind and snow until their hearts are frozen. Yet their eyes are still shining, and their breath is still faint, unable to live and unable to die. The Japanese rebels standing under the tree and looking up are still clapping their hands and laughing. Alas, the cruelest things in the world can be said to end here!</p>
<p>The rich old men and young ladies who sing and dance and enjoy the southern scenery, the frontier drums have moved the earth. Please, when the singing and dancing stop, think about the soldiers of the Volunteer Army who are hanging upside down on treetops, put yourselves in their shoes. If you are not touched and do not think of any way to act spontaneously, then you are truly numb, living corpses whose hearts have already died!</p>
<p>Although, the country has reached today, and there are still such peaceful scenes to embellish it, it cannot be said that it is an intentional or unintentional revelation from those above. Please see, our respected gentlemen, are still leisurely and leisurely about the long-vacant central positions, and follow the way of the former kings, and give way to the country. You push me and I push you, and you are very polite! It is almost more than Yao and Shun giving way, and Chao and Xu avoiding far away. If it were not that they had truly planned a unified plan that was enough to win thousands of miles away on diplomacy, people were not made of wood and stone, and they were party and state dignitaries who were admired by tens of thousands of people, how could they be so well-prepared? Mr. Wang Maosheng, an ignorant refugee, has come to Shanghai. Why don't you be honest and have to learn to publish news? Don't be surprised that this kind of news material will offend those above. Even I, who am below, feel a deep unease when I hear it: the contradiction between the bitterness and joy of people, especially people of the same country, is becoming increasingly acute, which is not a good thing!</p>

Ordinary varnish is only made by dissolving "shellac" in alcohol, or even mixing a part of rosin in shellac. This kind of impure varnish can only keep the shine for a short period of time when applied to woodenware. If varnish is prepared according to the following method, it can make the shine lasting and is very easy to dry. It can be used for high-end woodenware:</p>
<p>Raw Material Name　Mixing Amount</p>
<p>Shellac........................................4 ounces</p>
<p>Refined Camphor..........................1.43 ounces</p>
<p>Sandarach....................................4 ounces</p>
<p>Venice Turpentine.....................................1/2 ounce</p>
<p>(Venice Turpentine)</p>
<p>1 ounce</p>
<p>Methylated Spirit (Note).........................20 ounces</p>
<p>Mastic........................................1/2 ounce</p>
<p>Production method: Mix all the items on the right in a porcelain pot, then heat them until all kinds of things are completely dissolved in the methylated spirit and become liquid. Then take a fine gauze cloth, filter it, remove the dregs, and put it into a bottle, and the varnish is complete.</p>
<p>How to use: When varnish is stored in a bottle, the bottle stopper must be sealed to prevent air leakage. When using it, dip a soft brush or cotton cloth in the varnish and gently apply it on the woodenware. When applying it, it must be fast and orderly, and it must be even and smooth. If you want to renovate old woodenware that has been coated with varnish, then you only need to apply it directly. If you want to change the new woodenware to any color, you only need to dissolve any "aniline" dye in boiling water, first apply it on the wood, and then apply varnish after it dries. If you want to change it to the common orange-yellow color, then you only need to mix Bismarck brown into the varnish, and you can directly apply it on new woodenware.</p>
<p>Note: If methylated spirit is not available, pure alcohol can be used instead.</p>

<p>Reading only reveals delicate beauties in books. Ten years under the window is truly in vain.</p>
<p>Old horses with blind eyes laugh at you all. Singing a wild song, pouring out fragrant wine.</p>

<p>Dove in snow, seeking sugary dregs. Guzzling, unable to fly.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Too Hard on My Daughter! <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I sent you a letter entitled "Such Parents" last time, and I am grateful that you published it in the newspaper on the 20th of this month. When I saw the response letter, thinking of the blood ties, I immediately went to the bank and withdrew the three hundred yuan I had saved from household expenses over the past six months to subsidize my family. Who knew that after receiving this three hundred yuan, they bought a large coat for each of my three younger brothers and two younger sisters, each costing over thirty yuan, and also bought leather shoes for over ten yuan a pair. Furthermore, they went to foreign barbershops to perm and wash their hair. It pains me so much that the household expenses I had painstakingly saved over half a year were all spent on decoration! Yesterday, my mother asked me to give them another one hundred yuan. Because they do not cherish my money, I refused her request, and she scolded me for being a miser and having no sisterly feelings at all. Sir, please tell me how should I treat this kind of biased mother? With respect, Jiang Shimeiying</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Mrs. Jiang's latest letter, we now know that her parents are indeed too hopeless: no wonder their daughter is unwilling to subsidize them! We dare not advise Mrs. Jiang to spend her husband's hard-earned money so carelessly. Because this could cause her parents to fall further and further down; and it could also turn her younger siblings into vagrants who "only know how to squander and do not know the cost of things."</p>
<p>Blood ties still exist; Mrs. Jiang must put in more effort. Your parents are getting older, so that is not a problem. But your younger siblings are still young, and you must not only refrain from watching them starve to death without helping, but you should also actively take responsibility for their education. In the future, if they succeed, it will also be to your credit; and it will also create some talents for China, or at least reduce the number of free riders for the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate that Mrs. Jiang should not unconditionally subsidize her family in the future; you should be responsible for your younger siblings' education expenses, and you may directly pay the school fees. You should also check their schoolwork at any time. As for daily necessities, buy some to give to them when they are truly needed. As for your mother's harsh words, you do not need to take them to heart, as everyone around you can see who is right and who is wrong!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"No! Absolutely not! I can swear there isn't!" Wu Yi vigorously knocked a clothes brush on a wooden frame holding a sand water filter. "If you say the Kuomintang is the Republic of China, then their party anthem is of course the national anthem! But I'm the first not to acknowledge it!"</p>
<p>"Old Roar, calm down, discussing the main matter is important!" Ma Liguo hurriedly shifted the conversation to the main topic. "Because just now the ship owner discussed with me: he said that a distinguished guest came aboard after passing Honolulu, that is our National Government's plenipotentiary minister to the United States, Dr. Liu. In order to show the emotional bond between Chinese and American people, they plan to have their band play a Chinese national anthem during dinner tonight. But they don't have the score there, so they asked me to write it out for them. Suppose, ... suppose your words are true, wouldn't this be terrible? How can we say that China has no national anthem!"</p>
<p>"Ah! ... Haha! So that's what it's all about. But what if China really doesn't have a national anthem?" Wu Yi replied, both angry and amused.</p>
<p>"Really doesn't have one?" Ma Liguo still couldn't fully believe it.</p>
<p>"Really doesn't have one! Most likely, the government, because the national treasury is empty, so it has no power to write one!" Apart from this "misinterpretation", even if you brought old Master Yan Pingzhong, who was good with words, out of his coffin, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to find another sufficient reason to explain why the Great Republic of China has no national anthem!</p>
<p>"In that case, you, my old friend, are a great author, so please make one temporarily!" Ma Liguo truly deserves to be the son of an important Chinese figure. He is extremely familiar with the set of tricks in Chinese politics, where every time there is a change, people are randomly pulled from within the party to serve as ministers in various departments. He thought that as long as someone had a slight skill, they would be an omnipotent treasure: someone who had been a military commander could concurrently serve as a diplomat; someone who had been a university president might as well be transferred to head the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, he also thought that since Wu Yi was an author, he would certainly be able to fill in a song score!</p>
<p>"Isn't this a joke! Not to mention that I don't understand music and can't fill it in, even if I could, a national anthem can't be fabricated casually! I remember that before the Kuomintang came into power and before the three northeastern provinces were lost, we did have a very magnificent national anthem, the one that goes 'Qing Yun Chou Xi...' But now, it's not allowed, if you sing another sentence, you can't escape the crime of being a counter-revolutionary, and maybe there's even hope of being shot! ... Haha! ... "Wu Yi ridiculed in an extremely painful tone. "However, if they really want to play it, you can directly ask Minister Liu himself. See what he orders?"</p>
<p>"That's right! That's right!" Ma Liguo was overjoyed to be able to approach Minister Liu through this, and he really went.</p>
<p>He was gone for a full forty minutes before he returned, his attitude very excited, holding a letter in his hand neatly. "Your words are true! Minister Liu also said that our national anthem has not yet been produced; but he has already thought of a compromise, he personally wrote this letter, teaching me to hand it over to the captain. Look!"</p>
<p>Wu Yi indeed pulled out two pages of letter paper from the envelope. Looking at it, the first page was a very beautiful English letter. The general idea was: "The score of the Chinese national anthem is extremely complicated, and it is really difficult to copy out temporarily; but since you have shown great hospitality and plan to play our national music to show your welcome to my humble person, then I dare not disappoint you too much. I am specially recording an ancient song of our country, which at that time described the spirit of envoys going abroad to foreign countries and never surrendering until death..." The second page was the sheet music for "Su Wu Herding Sheep."</p>
<p>"What a good compromise! Truly worthy of being an old diplomat!" Wu Yi praised with great satisfaction, "Otherwise, Chinese people without a national anthem really wouldn't know how to cover their shame!"</p>

<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>On the third day after Dr. Ulrich K.T. Schulz, the leader of the Wufa Photographic Expedition, returned to Berlin from Northern Europe, a reporter went to the Wufa Company to interview him. Stepping into the doctor's office, it looked very much like a scientist's or explorer's laboratory. They started talking unceremoniously in such a place:</p>
<p>"You want to see me? Good, then please tell me what you want to ask!"</p>
<p>"Please tell me, what were you thinking about before I came in?"</p>
<p>"Think! I, who left Berlin for five months and just returned from working in Northern Europe: apart from the films taken in Northern Europe and the local customs, what else would I be thinking about? Believe me, the things in the North are all different from here. I had the idea of "going to Northern Europe" a long time ago, but my courage was repeatedly thwarted by the severe cold weather in Northern Europe, but now I have finally achieved my goal. This time, thanks to the excellent equipment, we took many valuable films. We not only captured scenes on and under the water: but also drove airplanes to capture them in the air. Ten thousand five thousand feet high is not a matter. The mouth of the Norwegian fjord is two hundred and sixty miles across the continent. In addition to flying across, we also sat on sailboats, back and forth among the cliffs.</p>
<p>Taking the scene of fish schools spawning in still water."</p>
<p>"Would you like to tell me about your most interesting experience this time?"</p>
<p>"I'm very willing. On the shore of the fjord, there are many trees with flowers in full bloom. Imagine such beautiful trees, with cliffs and white snow on their backs, and a vast ocean in front of them. What an interesting natural beauty! Therefore, when we flew across the fjord, we used reflective photography to capture many wonders."</p>
<p>"What is reflective photography? Could you explain it to me?"</p>
<p>"Ordinary photography is opposite to sunlight. This is a good way to let the object receive sunlight and reflect light; but our photography is against sunlight. This method has not been invented for long, it is not only convenient, and the wonders that could not be captured before can now be captured: the beautiful scenery of the rapids and waterfalls that we captured this time are all using this method.

<h3 id="e278">Several Submissions Regarding "Morning in the Metropolis" <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<h3 id="e279">(1) It is a Great Success <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Jiling</p>
<p>In terms of consciousness, it also achieved great success. It does not have the petty bourgeois illusion of disillusionment, it indicates a bright future for the masses. It tells the suffering masses: don't be afraid of anything, don't accept the hypocritical pity of the rich, and don't covet personal enjoyment: only by struggling hard under the life of hardship and oppression, daring to give the oppressors a merciless and cruel beating, is the way out for the suffering masses.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Gao Zhanfei and Wang Renmei are both very powerful. Yuan Congmei's villain is indeed an old hand. Tang Huaiqiu was too rigid when he first appeared, but later he was not bad. The rest, such as Wang Guilin and Liu Jiqun, are all very good. Yan Duoyun, who plays the young Xu Languang, has a lot of performing talent and is a promising child.</p>
<h3 id="e280">(2) He Also Says the Plot is Great <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Ying</p>
<p>The true meaning of the script is worthy of our admiration. It shows the sacredness and nobility of labor everywhere. However, in a deformed society like China, not only is the class gap between rich and poor huge, but the social economy is also too unevenly distributed, resulting in the sacred and noble workers earning only enough to barely maintain their personal lives each day, while those capitalists who do not engage in production live a comfortable life without working. "Morning in the Metropolis" is a powerful cry for the sacred and noble workers of the masses, and at the same time, it undoubtedly gives the people of the times a great inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Gao Zhanfei's tough and profound performance made me feel infinite sympathy. Wang Renmei's innocence and brilliance made me feel that she was extremely lovable. Wang Guilin's loving father and son simply brought people to tears.</p>
<p>In short, this film has achieved great success in terms of performance and significance. However, in terms of plot, it seems a bit lacking in compactness.</p>
<p>"Ten Thousand Flowers Offering Charm" is a hot song and dance blockbuster starring Eddie Conte, which will premiere today at the Guanglu Lanxin Theater.</p>
<h3 id="e281">(3) But There Are Contradictions and Shortcomings <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>The people immersed in the dark city are extremely depressed! Who doesn't dream of a ray of dawn coming to light our way to the light? Therefore, "Morning in the Metropolis" appeared in response to the needs of the times. It and "City Night" are films that are connected in one breath; the plot, performance, photography, everything, has the same tune played in different ways. However, the power of "City Night" is still a bit deeper! This film can also be regarded as a successful work by Lianhua. But looking closely, there are still many loopholes inside.</p>
<p>First, many actors don't know how to walk. Moving too fast shows that they are too hurried.</p>
<p>Second, when the workers pull the carts, they don't use any force at all, which clearly shows that they are filming a play.</p>
<p>Third, the part where the little Sanzi in the countryside is joking is a bit too much.</p>
<p>These are the shortcomings of the performance; there are also contradictions and ambiguities in the plot.</p>

<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>Hong Shen and Tian Han Suggest</p>
<p>Lianhua Company Adopts</p>
<p>The recent long novel "Midnight I" by the literary writer Shen Congwen (Mao Dun) depicts deeply and has profound implications, which has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. Giants in the film and theater industry, Hong Shen, Tian Han, etc., specially suggested to Lianhua Company, advocating that Shen's long novel "Midnight" be adapted into a movie script, which has already been agreed by Cai Chusheng, the director of Lianhua Company. However, in order to maintain the true face of his work, Shen specially requested the authorities that the compilation of the script should not change the author's original intention, and the leading actors must be those who have cultivated in drama and literature; the author will personally direct the psychological descriptions so as to be meticulous. The company authorities deeply appreciated his intention and are now planning everything. As soon as everything is ready, filming will begin.</p>
<h3 id="e283">(4) A Few Words of Praise for Gao and Yuan <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>I have learned a lot about the films starring Gao Zhanfei. However, there are not many that are satisfactory. "Pink Dreams" and "Dawn", which premiered not long ago, are considered by some people to be his success; but I think that he has only just entered the hall and has not yet entered the room. After "Morning in the Metropolis" was released, it told us that he has risen to the level of art and has seen the hall. Here he is impeccable. However, at the same time, I discovered that the script gave him a lot of help in this success. Otherwise, even if he has the talent for performance, it would be like "a hero with no place to use his strength."</p>
<p>I don't need to talk about Yuan Congmei, just borrow Cai Chusheng's words once; "...In his pure life, sin is impossible to break into, but due to his imagination and creation, he has in fact created his unique villain star status on the screen. ...And thank him for adding a lot of strength to "Morning in the Metropolis" in the opposite direction." Indeed, imagination and creation are indispensable elements for the success of every star, not only Yuan Congmei personally should do so.</p>
<h3 id="e284">(5) The Year Should Be Noted <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The material of the whole play is completely implying the toxicity of inheritance to people, and the sacredness of labor makes the audience under the screen realize the true meaning of life. Of course, the result and effect are different from those scripts that are aimless and deliberately mischievous. We naturally have to say that this script is a success!</p>
<p>In terms of actors, the talents are very average, and there are few mistakes. What we especially admire is Wang Renmei's Lan'er. Her lively and innocent situation is just right for a village girl's identity. We hope that the directors of Lianhua can grasp her personality so that she can develop her acting talent.</p>
<p>However, from my subjective point of view, in "Morning in the Metropolis", the prologue of the whole play feels a little loose and cannot reach a very tense situation. As for the year indicating the progress of time, I think Chinese films should use the Republic of China × year instead of using subtitles such as 1919 丨 丨 1933, because we China also has its own inherent year number, so why borrow the Western calendar? I wonder what the readers think?</p>

<p>Huang Naishuang, who plays the female lead in the happy film company's second production "Desperate", originally served as a basic actor in the Jinan Company. Huang also plays the lead role in the recent production "Striving for National Glory". Now that both films are about to be completed, I want to found a song and dance troupe in my spare time. Now I hear that I am already recruiting group members and have named it the Naishuang Song and Dance Research Group.

<p>— Yun Jun</p>
<p>Recently, a strange event occurred in Old Hollywood Country, that is, the "Five-Mile Plan" of George Arliss, an English veteran star who is about to turn 65, that is, he has to walk five miles every morning.</p>
<p>On Cahuenga Road, the old and strong Mr. Arliss strode forward step by step. His car and his chauffeur followed behind.</p>
<p>When Mr. Arliss felt a little struggling to walk, he automatically walked to the car and jumped into the car. As a result, the so-called five-mile walk only walked one-fifth of the way, and the remaining four miles were carried by Arliss' car. The heart is more than enough but the strength is not enough, so the sensational "Five-Mile Plan" was declared a failure.</p>
<h3 id="e287">A Record of the Production Process of "Cavalcade" <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The American Fox Company's new mega-film named Cavalcade, the original book is written by the famous British novelist Noel Coward. The British Isles have been recited for a while and regarded as a masterpiece of national glory. The American Fox Company purchased the film production rights from the author for a huge sum of money and added a lot of energy to the production. British national public opinion was in an uproar, pointing out that Old Howard's move was a humiliation to the country. Now the Fox Company has spent millions of dollars to complete the filming of this film. Both sides of the Atlantic are sensationalized by it, and the greatness of its value can be imagined. It is planned to excerpt and enrich the film publication of this drama's story. However, there are still many anecdotes left behind before the filming of this film, which have not been told, so I will focus on describing them here as a guide to the translation.</p>
<p>The general idea of this book is to describe the tragic war suffered by Britain since the beginning of the 20th century and the pain of the disintegration and separation of a giant official's (the protagonist in the book) family, and to compare it with the peaceful scene of the Victorian era at the end of the 19th century, in which there are many emotionally moving places. The author sold the photography rights to Hollywood not to seek a large profit. Now that Fox Company has made the film, the author's heart can be reported to the British people without shame. The great financial resources used to produce this film almost relocated all the famous attractions of London in 1900 to Hollywood, so that the veterans who traveled there were almost suspicious of the former capital 30 years ago, and often felt grief and could not make a sound, which shows the precision and greatness of the arrangement.</p>
<p>After the photography rights of this book were sold to Hollywood by Coward and aroused the reaction of the British people, the Fox Company decided to use all British actors in the whole play in order to please the British and not lose the British nature. All those who were not born in London and educated in London were not allowed to be actors. Even directors, photographers, lighting engineers, etc. are all staffed by British people. Because of this, Fox heroines such as Ann Harding, Irene Dunne, and Irene Sheridan were not selected, and Diana Wynyard, who had just come to the United States from England, was used instead. Fox's famous director Paul Tschi can only participate in the work of preparation and production, and the real director is Frank Lloyd, a clever Englishman. Reginald Berkoy, a member of the British House of Commons, was also appointed as the film script editor.</p>
<p>Since the entire staff for the production and performance must be staffed by British people, the Fox Company felt the lack of British talent in the United States. Therefore, they had no choice but to send a special envoy to London to look for actors among the dancers and actors of the play. After several careful selections, they obtained several male and female actors. However, there were also difficulties in the middle, which were unexpected by the company. For example, the child actors in the play had already obtained considerable talents, and the contract had also been signed. Unexpectedly, when boarding the ship to the United States, they were suddenly banned by the British immigration authorities, because according to British law, there is a clause that "children under the age of fourteen shall not go abroad to perform for profit." The company was hindered by this, so they had to change their plans and look for roles in British families in the United States. (To be continued)</p>
