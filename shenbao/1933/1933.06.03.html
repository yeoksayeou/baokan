<p>監察軍備制度起爭辯</p>
<p>法修正案日獨持異議</p>
<p>國民社一日巴黎電軍縮交涉之中心點、現顯已移至法都巴黎、因法外長彭古及美代表台維斯、俱已於今日深晚由日内瓦赴巴黎、聞在該處將與英外相西門氏相會　再從事於陸地軍備减縮問題之討論、</p>
<p>國民一日日内瓦電今日軍縮會議總委員會已將英國提出之軍縮公約草案第一讀完畢、事先對於草約之末節、關於建立永久管理委員會監督各國軍縮之進行一節、各國曾有爭辯、而法國代表前此對於各種軍備之減縮素抱保持之態度者今日忽提許多減縮案、並有波蘭及小協約諸國加以踴躍之贊助、惟他國代表均未加以表决、以靜待詳細之審查、故結果如何、尙須待第二讀時始可明瞭也、惟德代表那杜爾尼氏曾聲明、無論何種管理方法、凡能爲他國所贊成者、德國亦無不接受之後、由主席漢德森動議會議延會至星期二日、届時再將第一讀投票表决、</p>
<p>國民一日日内瓦電軍縮會議主幹委員會昨晚忽以高壓手段、决定將總委員會宣告延會至六月二十七日、而以自身代替總委員進行英國軍縮協定草案之第二讀、致今日總委員中發生極興奮之討論、參加者有二十餘代表、經長久辯論後、决定接受主幹委員會之决議、惟附以保留案數條、一爲總委員會之重開、至遲不得過七月三日、二爲各國政府間所將開始之接洽、應由主席漢德森負責辦理、三爲英國提案是否非但爲此後討論之張本並將爲軍縮公約之張本一問題、應於第一讀之末次會議解决之、</p>
<p>國民社日内瓦電今日軍縮會議總委員會内、各國代表除日本外、均已接受法國有效能的連續監察軍備提議、法代表在會力主唯有施行連續的檢查與監察、始能使軍備不超越國際公約規定數量、美國台維斯接受此議宣稱、美國樂於見有檢查機關之運用、其唯一保留祇有勿强迫美國對於違約國施行軍事制裁耳、日本則對於監察提議提出總保留、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社一日日内瓦電軍縮會議總委員會、審查英國提案中關於監察問題之一章、法國代表巴德望陳述法國之修正案、其主旨在使監察制度就地施行、定期施行、自動施行、並爲常設性質、遇破壞軍縮公約時、凡以善意揭發者、宜保障其人之安全、挪威代表蘭奇·美國代表台維斯·瑞士代表摩逹·以及捷克·波蘭·芬蘭等國代表、均贊成法國所提之修正案、捷克代表係以小協商各國之名義發言、英國代表擬俟第二讀會時、再行表示意見、德國代表那多尼亦然荷蘭代表及蘇俄代表李維諾夫均贊成法國修正案、法國代表見如許國家均贊成法國之主張、特起立致謝、謂數年以來、國際上監察軍備思想之有進步、於此可見、彭古又以英國計畫中列入監察之組織、特對英國稱謝彭古以爲就各代表演說觀之、可見軍縮會議對於就地施行、自動施行、及常設性質之監察制度、將予以接受、惟爲全部條文前後貫澈起見、自不能不作若干保留耳、監察制度一經實行、則各國間之猜疑及嫌惡將减至極小限度、而平等權利由此可見諸實行、蓋各國對於鄰國之所作所爲、均可加以監視也、此於台維斯之演說中、尤可見之、日本意大利及匈牙利代表宣言、各該國對法國提案將注意研究云、</p>

<p>德國提出有礙軍縮會條件</p>
<p>俄報揭破英反蘇聯新計畫</p>
<p>哈瓦斯一日日内瓦電德國對於四强條約之接受、提出數種有礙於軍縮會議之條件、易詞言之、即此種條件與法國在日内瓦始終主張之見地、不相符合是也、因此四强條約尙須若干時間、始能簽訂、又自英外相西門及意大利代表阿樂亞西離日内瓦之後、彭古對於四强條約、未嘗進行任何談判、羅馬最後所提之條文、巴黎方面、於最近四十八小時始行接到、路透一日倫敦電英外相西門今日在下院稱、關於四强公約之文件、詳述其原委者、將印成白皮書公佈之、至於此種文件之切實形式、尙未十分决定云、</p>
<p>塔斯社一日莫斯科電此間眞理報謂、四强公約之第二次草案、雖與原案逈異、但英國之干涉政策曾未稍變、該報續稱、英國保守主義者用其全力以掌握全歐之命運、並利用凡爾賽和約矛盾之加深、以遂其私慾第一、彼等希圖諸帝國主義國家在凡爾賽和約問題上之戰爭、在今日得以避免第二、彼等企圖對於法國及其同盟國與德國間之關係、執行其公正裁判者之任務、第三、彼等願爲德國法西斯主義關一東路、並指示其活動、循此方向進行、眞理報在其結論中、謂倫敦之救世主、已無再行利用國聯之希望、彼等已準備放棄國聯、另造一機關以替代之、此種新機關對於英國實現其外交政策、特别實施其對蘇聯之干涉政策時將更爲適宜、唯反蘇聯之新計劃是否成功、不能單憑英國之進出决定云、</p>

<p>││武進趙煜君來信││</p>
<p>天天瞧着先生們爲讀者解决疑難問題，而現在輪到我││其實是大部份商界，目前受營業稅局。壓迫得走頭無路的問題。現在所討論的，明知是無濟於大局。但這是大衆的呻吟，値得討論罷！</p>
<p>今年常州城襄二十七家錢莊，已倒去二十一家，剩餘的六家，也無日不在風雨飄搖中，其他各業，亦有閉無開，商界衰落之景象，可想而知！而失業靑年之激增，平民生活之艱苦，號稱公僕之官廳，又何嘗一顧？近更大施榨壓，例如最近之營業稅：甲號物品抽稅千份之五，售與乙號，則乙號又須抽稅千份之五；設乙號再轉售於丙號，則丙號又再須抽稅千份之五；輾轉　售，層層抽稅；並不分淸奢侈品，與平民日用品，而已完國稅者亦在徵稅之列，嗚呼！國家捐稅之本意，豈如是乎？</p>
<p>［苛政猛於虎，惡吏毒於蛇；］我想現在是中華民國，政府决不是猛虎？官吏並不是毒蛇？他們是我輩的公僕。公僕做錯了事，做主人翁的，應該出來糾正。善乎否乎？敬詢於│高明的│編　先生：（一）反對苛稅，是否係危害民國？（二）已完國稅之物品，是否有納營業稅之義務？（三）萬一［毒蛇］噬人，我們用何法消滅之？</p>
<p>答：來信所叙述的社會現象是中國現在普遍的破產的一幅畢眞畫圖，不但常州如是，鎭江也復如是：鎭江的錢莊三數十家，而今年上市的僅六七家：至於銀行依然如故，還添了一兩家。這其間，我們至少可以看出：㈠中國的高利貸資本與商業資本被呑没於銀行資本的趨勢：㈡農村破產，農民借債無力，蘇杭常一帶的絲綢業紗業破產，現金大部從内地流出來，歸到上海，内地錢莊周轉不靈，十九閉歇。不但鎭·常如此·即其他大都市如杭州·漢口·南京·上海亦復如此。『政府决不是猛虎？官吏决不是毒蛇？』這種問題的决定，不應當由牠的名義││所謂『公僕』││應當由牠的事實；不應當由牠的文告。而應當由牠的施政。其餘三問一并答復如下：㈠反對苛稅决不是『危害民國』；不但不危害牠並且是維護牠。因爲眞正的民國絕對不容　有苛捐雜稅，而容納苛捐雜稅。甚至『上下交征利』地獎勵苛稅，絕對不是民國而是民國之敵。㈡已完納國稅的物品，論理是不應征收任何捐稅，縱不得已而　征稅之必要，也必得人民自己瞭解，信任並承諾這種捐稅是爲國爲民的：若人民祗有納稅的義務而無從瞭解，末由信任更是没有承諾或否决這種捐稅的權利與機會，那人民對於這種捐稅，照法律講根本就没有必須繳納苛稅的義務。㈢若果眞是毒蛇，一定會噬人，我們便應當消滅牠。中國古人有一句格言，『打蛇要打七寸』│這句話在現在自然還不失其相當的意義。然而要曉得。現在的毒蛇不是一條，而是一羣，那末現在打蛇的方法也就不能再從個人行動着想，就是說，不再是個人的力量可以消滅的，祗有大家結合起來才可以消滅這種蛇羣·</p>

<p>襄</p>
<p>眞空管無論用作高週率或低週率放大時，栅極上必須有適當的負電壓，這負電壓的來源有二種：第一種是用一組Ｃ電池接在栅電路裹供給之；第二種是用一電阻器接在栅路裹，利用屏電流經過這電阻時所產生的電壓降來供給之。市上的交流收音機，都是利用第二法的。這電阻的數値，關係很大，必須準確，否則眞空管的效用全失。算法如下：</p>
<h3 id="c195">栅電阻 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>㈠電阻數値的算法</p>
<p>先在各式眞空管特性表上（此表購買眞空管時内附之說明書及無綫電書籍上均有之）查明該號眞空管所需之栅電壓及其屏電流數値，依照歐姆定律，以屏電流除栅電壓，求得的商數，就是這栅位電阻應有的數値。如係簾栅眞空管，則簾栅電流亦須併入屏電流計之。例如２４７號眞空管栅極負電壓應有１６·５伏脫，屏電流爲３１千分安培·簾栅電流爲６千分安培·則栅電位電阻應爲１６·５○（·０３１＋·００６）＝４４５歐姆。</p>
<p>㈡電阻電力大小的算法</p>
<p>購買電阻器時除數値外，還要注意其能負電力之大小。電力的單位是瓦特·算法也很簡單·祗要把電流自乘後再乘以電阻的數値，其積就是電力之大小。譬如前例的電阻，其電力應爲·０３７２ｘ４４５＝·６瓦特。實際應用時，爲安全起見，須用三倍於這電力的電阻最適宜，所以這電阻標明的電力限度，應擇二瓦特的方可。</p>
<h3 id="c196">高電阻的自装 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>琦</p>
<p>無線電機中所用的另件，粗看是很複雜，不過歸納起來，除眞空管外，多是容器，綫圈，電阻·三件東西，在線路中接來接去，變化無窮罷了。</p>
<p>現在對於電容器·線圈的做法，書籍雜誌上發表不少。而對於電阻一物，尙鮮自製。原因（一）在於不易測得其阻力，（二）不耐熱度（即電力Ｗａｔｔ不大），但照我實騐下來·在普通收音機裹，（大多指交流者）所用的高電阻，均不到一瓦特。譬如在一座三管機中，檢波管電所用之降壓電阻·大約在四萬歐姆左右·而所通過之電流，至多也不過五千分安培（５ＭＡ）如２７眞空管·檢波時·不到三千分安培·則上述之電阻固有的瓦特，是１２ＸＲ（０·００３）２Ｘ４０·０００＝０·３６Ｗａｔｔ·照上述之公式可知電阻之耐熱量·在等電流時·與其電阻Ｂ成正比。</p>
<p>現在再講做法·說到固定的·所要的材料·不過是幾根良好的火柴（照實騐所知·國貨是美麗牌的頂好），濃墨汁·６Ｂ或軟鉛筆一枝·薄銅片一小方，製法先將火柴浸在墨汁中·使其浸透待乾·倘阻力要很大如２Ｍｅｇ或１／２Ｍｅｇ·時，則不必再塗鉛，但有時亦須少許，如在四萬歐姆則須塗滿·再將薄銅皮剪成凸形·捲在火柴上就成了（圖一）。照上面的做法，也可說是半可變的，祇將銅套移動，變其距離，愈近則阻力愈小或反之。實騐經過當火柴塗滿黑鉛，在四萬歐姆時，約相距一生的（ｃｍ·），而在一千歐姆左右（當作代Ｃ電用）則兩者愈近愈好，但阻力與其距離，並無一定之比例，因鉛的多少大有出入，須由實騐而定；若要完美些可將此電阻藏於細玻璃管中，兩端用火漆封好。</p>
<p>有時我們要用到可變的，如控制音量用，（在ｒｏ，ｏｏｏ｜Ｉｏｏ｀ｏｏｏ歐姆左右）控制推盪用及電位器等等，則可照第二圖去做，材料也很節省，盤用硬橡皮製成。約一四厚已夠。中穿一孔：或將舊的可變電阻將阻力線拆去也行，各種做法看了第二圖，一定很明瞭，他的作用是把銅皮在吸水紙上移動，間接的將其距離變更，塗鉛與否同固定的一樣，須自已實騐。因篇幅關係不能多述，對於高阻力的量法，當另爲文詳述之。</p>

<p>現在天氣漸熱，雷是常常會發生的。凡置有天線者當備一個避雷器以防之。現在來介紹一個費用極省的避雷器，成績同市上所售者無異。諸位不妨一試。製法如左：</p>
<p>備長三寸闊二寸紥銅片一塊·木板一方；和螺絲二只。先用剪刀把銅片剪成很尖的犬牙形·把照樣剪二塊銅片一端用螺絲旋在木板上。二者尖齒，愈貼近愈佳。但不可相觸，以成短路。照上法製就。這避雷器就可告成功了。其接綫如左圖。</p>

<p>程權</p>
<p>玩交流收音機最使人不快的，就是收音機發生了各種故障，或交流聲震耳，或劈拍之聲不斷，或竟聲息全無。遇到了這種情狀，不得不自己下手修理。但是動手雖然不難，然而要查出弊病出在那裹。却不十分容易。往往一種病狀，原因却有十幾種。而且收音機内部線路複雜，接線紊亂，更易使人見之束手。作者現在來介紹一種檢查法·依法檢查，則雖極細之處，亦極易察出。只須備直流電壓表一只。此表須能量零至六弗及零至二百弗者。及接線二根。爲講述簡便起見，以一普通交流收音機之末級爲例·分别說明之。</p>
<p>圖爲一末級放大及電源部，Ｔ爲末級低週波變壓器·Ｖｉ爲放大管·Ｖ２爲整流管·Ｐ·Ｔ·爲電源變壓器，ＡＦＣ爲扼制圈·Ｃ１Ｃ２爲濾波電容器·Ｒ２爲代Ｃ電阻，Ｃ３爲傍路電容器·Ｒ１爲中心電阻，（亦有因電源變壓器内已有中心分線而不用中心電阻者。）檢查者先將收音機點亮·再分别檢查其屏極絲三回路。</p>
<h3 id="c201">屏回路 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>將電壓表之負極接一線至Ｒ１之１１處·再將高壓一端（即電壓表零至二百弗至一段）之正極，接一線至圖中２處。此時喇叭未接，故表上指針不動。如將喇叭接上而表針仍不動·可將正極接線改接至３處，如指針動·則喇叭綫圈斷綫。如指針仍不動·乃改接至５處，如表針動·則Ａ·Ｆ·Ｃ斷綫。如指針仍不動·再改接至６處·如指針動·則６至５一段接綫有斷。如指針仍不動·則整流管已壞·換一新者試之。如指針仍不動，則電源變壓器高壓綫有損·或Ｃ１Ｃ２短路。此時或將電壓表之負極·改接至地綫上·如表針動·則Ｒ１已損壞矣。</p>
<h3 id="c202">槅回路 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>將電壓表改用低壓一段者（即零至六弗）之負極·接至圖中Ｇ處·將正極接至Ⅱ處·可量得有二弗左右之電壓·則槅回路無損·如表針不動·則必Ｃ３短路咸Ｒ２斷綫矣。</p>
<h3 id="c203">絲回路 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>交流收音機之絲回路爲交流電，故不能用直流電壓表量得正確之電壓數。但普通可看燈絲明亮的種度而定。如眞空管不乏亮·則可另換一只新者試之，（或用手電筒内之電球代亦可。）如果仍不亮·那麽電源變壓器或接線斷了。</p>
<p>以上所說皆就末級而言·但是初級次級都同·皆可依照所述之步序而校騐。至於檢查三回路的先後·則要照病狀而定。如果燈不亮，就先查絲回路·亮而無聲·則先查屏回路·如有聲而不淸·或有雜聲·則要先查槅回路。末了有幾句話要請注意。</p>
<p>㈠收音機有病狀發生時，須先查天地線及避雷器。</p>
<p>㈡查出了一種弊病。須再查有否其他弊病。</p>
<p>㈢每次須記錄作下次之參考。</p>

<p>李元慶</p>
<p>自己試騐交流收音機·時常容易發生許多怪呌的聲音，下面所說的是最普通的幾種：</p>
<p>（一）再生式收音機在將起振盪時，接收外來播音，最爲靈敏。但是，在這時候，常會發生一種［潑脫］［潑脫］類似汽油船放氣時的聲音，（Ｍｏｔｏｒｂｏａｔｉｎｇ）擾亂正音，十分可厭。補救的方法，先減低檢波的Ｂ電，如無效·再將檢波Ｂ電的傍路電容器換２ｍｆ·者即可（見第一圖）（二）收音機在將起振盪時，除掉發生上面所說的一種聲音外，有時還會發生一種長嘯聲（Ｆｒｉｎｋｈｏｗ）（大槪是在波長較短的地位上）如果在第一級低週率放大變壓器的次級線圈上，並接一個０·１｀２Ｍｅｇ歐姆的電阻，便可避免。直流收音機發生此種呌聲時，也可照樣避免。（見第二圖）</p>
<p>（三）有時收音機在起初開放時·發生一種呌聲·待到燈絲燃熱後·便又回復原狀·此種特殊現象，雖無妨碍，終屬可厭。補救的方法，同第二條。</p>
<p>（四）收音機不振盪時，發生一種呌聲振盪時則否。避免的方法，在箱底舖上一塊銅皮，再把銅皮接通地線便可。</p>
<p>還有栅極線路靠近屏電路，檢波管不用隔離罩，栅漏數値太小······也會發生各種呌聲。這裹爲篇幅所限，不再詳述。</p>

<p>自内政會議有變更縣組織法、提高縣長職權、改各科之議後各省聞風興起、逕已實行者實繁有徒、</p>
<p>改局爲科、是否較專設各局爲善、此姑諸置不論但以改教育局爲縣政府之一科言、就理論·歷史、事實·國情·數方面分析觀實覺未有一當、</p>
<p>就理論言、教育爲專門事業、非其他普通政事可比、教育行政、必須素習教育者主持之、方能熱心從事、勝任愉快、縣長爲普通官吏、教育非所素習、一旦責以教育行政、不恃觀念不同、易被忽視、卽或不被忽視、亦屬情形隔膜、措置難免乖方、</p>
<p>就歷史言、我國自興學以來除少數省分外、各縣教育行政、向係設局專管、相沿迄今、垂數十年、卽在昔科舉時代各縣亦均設有教諭、訓導等官、專管教育事宜、素與普通行政、不相混淆、│歐美各國、情形亦復如是、地方教育行政、往往設局等管、與普通行政晝然分列、即上海特區·現亦設有所謂［華人教育處］、管理學校、未將所謂［華人教育］、委之於普通官員、就事實言、我國少數省分、各縣教育行政、亦有未專設教育局者、但其學校之設置、遠不若設局省分爲多、教育成績亦遠不若設局省分爲優、據調查所知、今某省有若干縣、已改局爲科、而縣長或行政專員、挪移教育經費者有之、不顧教育法令而擯行己意者有之、卽縣長稍明教育者、亦苦於與校長接洽校務、日不暇給、絕不能更有關於教育之計畫可言、事實俱在、未可誣也、</p>
<p>就國情言、我國教育、方在萌芽設局專管猶慮爲普通行政所牽掣、不能專心致志、以使教育發</p>
<p>榮滋長、長足進步、故國聯教育考察圑、來華考察教育之後、有［教育行政應更不受普通行政干涉］之建議、並主張［各縣教育局長、應由教育廳委任之］、蓋炯知我國國情、不特主張設局專管教育行政、且進一步欲其完全脫離縣長之過問焉、</p>
<p>或謂、［改局爲科、在經費方面、可較節省、當此地方政府空虚之時、是亦不得已之辦法一、然設局有局長·督學·科員·書記等職員改科仍有科長·督學·科員·書記等職員其人數及待遇、實無大出人也、且經費不多、範圍可小、設局與、科會何以異、</p>
<p>或又謂、［改局爲科後、科長可由教育廳直接委任、不受縣長完全支配、仍與設局相等］、但在同一機關辦事、科長究爲屬員、倘與縣長主張不同、違之則有跋扈之嫌、從之則又心所不安、去從之間、窒礙叢生矣且改局爲科、卽無窒礙而仍與設局相等、則制度旣未有異、何必多此一舉乎、基於上述種理由、故主張現有之縣教育局、其已改科者、在可能範圍、應卽恢復、本未設局者、在相當相期、亦應酌量設置、並應由政府明定縣教育行政、以設局專管爲原則、縣組織法無論若何改變、此原則則應保存勿替、以重教育而專責成、</p>

<p>＝十九路前鋒驃悍表演極佳＝</p>
<p>＝復旦隊後衛穩健實力平衡＝</p>
<p>十九路軍足球隊昨日下午四時半、與復旦足球隊相見於中華棒球塲、是役也、雙方表演優美之技藝、在大無畏精神之下、奮門七十分鐘、、殺得灰塵大起、人球不分、結果、零對零和局</p>
<h3 id="c231">十九路聲色俱厲 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>十九路軍足球隊人壯馬强、加以江美敬鍾勇森二將、益覧錦上添花、全局十之七八、全在攻取包圍中、所認爲憾事者、臨門一脚、未能如願以償耳、兩翼頗有貢獻、中部亦精銳可取、中衛線及内衛、進退步驟井然、將來馮景祥、譚江柏·李天生·朱國倫等加入後、實力頑强、當非吾人意料所能及、</p>
<h3 id="c232">復旦隊力抗强敵 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>復旦隊中華會錦標、昨日首遭勁敵、恍如一葉孤舟、掙扎於狂風暴雨中、幸賴全軍用命、始得安逹彼岸、和平了結、當兩軍接觸之初、三度進窺、亦曾勢盛一時、顧不久實力高下漸分、乃退扼要隘、作防守計、十一人莫不盡力、守門楊銘金尤具奇債、然一次城門大開、彈中木柱、一次臨門咫尺、仰射雲霄、又復三度罰球、逢凶化吉、此則不無僥幸也、</p>
<h3 id="c233">往來良久無勝負 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>裁判沈回春銀笛一聲、戰雲四起、復旦以逸待勞、便宜不少、五分鐘後、前鋒三度進窺、祗以聯絡未熟、失機頻頻、周紹文·余順章·馮念漢輩虎虎可畏、江善敬大刀闊斧、氣可呑牛、十九路後防、有此柱石、雖屢見烽火、絕米燎原、未幾、復旦中堅王樹森在開球輸送軍火、爲許耀光、半路刧住、短交楊本漢、東郊起義、窘於安樂、生不得已一脚長請離門不遠、黃美順、不能當機立斷、遂取坐失良機、</p>
<h3 id="c234">余順章兩番失着 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>復旦戰士齊吃一驚、黑面將張客一聲怒吼、球出重圍、黃順躍攻不得、余順章鴻念漢互相提携連環進迫、頃刻間入重圍、江善敬與周逹雲糾纒、余順章立於最佳地位、得球而不能射門、曷勝浩漢、二分鐘後、鴻念漢可送一球、至十九路門前、余順章來暹一步、材大成軍以老拳球乃出險、</p>
<h3 id="c235">十九路奮攻不得 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>易地再戰、十九路前鋒、光芒逼人、復旦禁地中、砲火驚天、險象環見、王樹森忙將趙安二將、調回協力防守、余順章馮念漢兩騎、亦乘時趕至後防、帮助堵禦開球線内障碍重重、鍾勇森鄭少康十進十出、萬難建功、黃美順在王樹森嚴厲監視之下、竟覺寸步、難以厮殺一場、始終未能打開彊局、遂以○對○告終、</p>

<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>國是擴大的家庭，家醜不可外揚，國醜尤其不可外揚了。</p>
<p>我見西人所著的中國遊記，往往有侮辱我國的掃圖；或者，攝一幅鬆去足纏布的婦人纏足圖；或者，攝一幅鴉片烟鬼捧着烟槍吸烟圖；還有，其他種種不堪入目的惡劣現象，都是栩栩欲活的列入揷圖裏面，眞個坍盡了中土十七八層的盡了。近來，電影盛行，外國電影塲中時時放映侮辱我國的電影，專把中國黑暗社會盡量的獻曝。愛國者見了，當然要心痛氣結。但這些怪現象是從何處攝來的呢？這便要歸咎於一般不愛國的華人帶街的了。</p>
<p>廣州市社會局，近來取締一般專做帶街的人。鑒於各國人十到本市遊覧，每用熟諳路徑之人引導，名曰帶街。此輩帶街，問有導引外人專赴妓院賭窟，以及種種下流塲所，任意攝影，以致携歸海外，在公共塲所陳列放映，實屬大辱國體。社會局取締辦法，約分四種：㈠華人帶街，須先登記，方准執業。㈡領帶外僑遊覧，須先到局報明是日所遊地點，取得許可證，方可遊覧。㈢本局得隨時檢查帶街執照及許可證。㈣違此者不得帶街。</p>
<p>帶街，果有取締的必要，但，一紙官樣文章，果能掃除以前的積弊麽？再者，做帶街的便依了社會局的規定，領有登記執照及許可證；但，領得以後，仍舊引導外人到那黑暗社會中去參觀，試問社會局又用甚麽方法去干涉呢？</p>
<p>金錢引誘之下，可以喪失人們羞惡之心；卽就帶街而論，已可見得人格教育的缺乏。唉！這是一個根本問題。</p>
<h3 id="c254">窗口風味 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>這窗口簡直小得像洞口一般。凡是車站·戲院·公司·機關·銀錢票據授受的所在，總是這小小的窗口。每天有成千成萬的人來，嘗這窗口的風味。</p>
<p>我呢，每月要錢用：逢閒也愛瞧熱閙，有時也出門旅行，所以這窗口的風味，倒也大嘗而特嘗。人家詢我滋味怎樣？我說：甜酸苦辣，式式俱全。</p>
<p>銀行的窗口，最是難嘗；尤其是對於我們這般無產階級的人們。幾位職員大人，因爲他們成日和錢接觸，錢能通神，所以尊他一聲爲大人。朝奉般的面孔：冰箱般的語氣，呌人受不得。近年我更大受其累，因爲我辦事的所在，每月總是一張外國銀行支票，代替現銀。那不但是麻煩：種種不平等的情形，呌你肚子脹破。因爲穿中國衣服的人，另有一個窗口。支票授進去·像問口供般問一遍·然後給你一塊銅牌，呌你候着。候上半個和一個鐘點，不算一回事，錢到了·再覆審一次·然後交給你手裏。西人和穿西装的，那在另一窗口。他們把支票授進去，職員瞧一瞧，把錢拿出來。自始至終，不滿幾分鐘功夫。外國銀行到底牌子硬，充滿了這不平等的氣味。</p>
<p>影戲院和游藝塲的窗口，雖是化了錢，多少有些甜味。因爲你得了一張票子，便有許多熱閙給你瞧，不過有時生意太好了，也要呌你難受。我們貴國的人民，素來不大講究小的禮讓，先下手爲强，你擠我軋，有時竟給他們擠得上氣不接下氣。衣服擠破了：鞋子踏落了，竟是常見的事情。</p>
<p>車站的窗口，充滿了愉快和安慰；而有時也有些酸楚。因爲旅行的人，在窗口拿了一張票子，便可一日千里，遊山玩水，這是愉快的。歸家的人·拿了一張票子，送你迅速的回到故鄉，和家人戚友話舊，豈不是可慰的嗎！不過有些人謀食他鄉，父母送其子女：嬌妻送其丈夫，竟似陽關話别，免不得黯然淚下票子，竟似陽關話别，免不得黯然淚下咧丨</p>
<p>末了，還要說到本報會計處的窗口了。每逢結算稿資的日子，窗口外站着不少的筆尖同志，你也一張字據，我也成疊憑條。這區區數目·雖說是喝酒不醉，吃飯不飽。│特約的除外·這是指我們一般零星投稿的。│可是心血的結晶，也値得可貴。其次是兩位會計先生：一位年少的翻着賬簿，核對印鑑：一位年老的撥着算盤，計算酬資。倒也和和氣氣·誠誠懇懇。絕無朝奉般的面孔，銀行職員們的架子，那也値得我們感謝的一回事</p>

<p>日本私人辦的男女介紹所·已有好幾家，六月一日，東京市當局經辦的［結婚商量所］·也正式開　了。　　曠男怨女·一有　　　　，不　　　·祇須到［結優商景　］去商量一下，便可屐下紅絲一線牽·各得其所·而努力於製造小國民，不亦妙哉。</p>
<p>咱貴中國人，是再也聰明不過的，關於男女兩性問題的勾當，更是一學便會。你瞧·［自由戀愛］·多麽有勁？到法庭上去離婚·更是摩登。先行交易，擇吉開張的［試騐婚姻］，近來也有日臻具體化的趨勢，所以據咱的預料·在×年×月×日，咱中國的［婚姻介紹所］，必已籌備就緒，而將在各報封面上·登着大幅廣告·敬備着喜糕茶點，邀請花花公子，閨閣名媛，連袂光臨，共襄盛舉。</p>
<p>外國的情形怎樣，咱不敢胡吹，在咱貴中國·咱可看得瞭如指掌，一目了然。在男的方面，［有相當之職業，月入頗豐，徵求終身伴侶］的廣告不很靠得住。冒冒失失地找到了對手，又要吃［未滿十六歲，以强姦論］的官司。在女的方面，高不配·低不就，蹉跎成爲老小姐，心事躭足。把庚帖八字，望人衣袖裏亂塞，究也嫌不成體統。若胡亂對一頭親，又怕［家中已有大婦］。左也是難，右也是不妥，所以這個［婚姻介紹所］的舉辦，確是目前當務之急，而且是不容或緩的。</p>
<p>這個理想中的介紹所，最好是開在法院的貼鄰，那麽，男女一經離婚，就可馬上到介紹所來掛號，這倒是一種很好的買賣。但是說話到了中國人嘴裏·據說，是會得變壞的。若把這種介紹所，呌作了［皮條公司］，那就糟了。</p>

<p>競說爭看海市去。忽已暨樓不知處。亭臺宮闕最上層。恍在浛溟無雲路。水中草木不知何世界。往來船舶帆張風砲若能數。我欲實地一尋此異景。頓然舉目隱没失依據。豈眞弱水沈舟羽毛不可渡。乃是直上扶搖獨少倦客馭。縱有帝予超塵八萬刦。驚車鳳駕轆轆難停駐。何况人間枉勞跋踄待喧諱。笑煞一般遙看詫怪浮遮。要知瓊樓玉宇天上幾百座。玉嬰太眞奄忽到底此去落誰家。卽使脚踏十洲三島徧搜覔。雲斤月斧何處有消息。若問那個住向九霄穹蒼外。金碧樓臺隱隱聽得吹玉笛。琉璃宫殿雲時見萬層。回頭瞬息蒼狗已消滅。噫吁唏。莫道大地徒紛然。靑島光景也催遷。試看暨氣來相映。恐後爭先若醉頭。</p>

<p>第八回僨語激靑年辭官遁去</p>
<p>熱心憐少女挾纊親來</p>
<p>積之道：上次我們在乳茶舖裏談話，我已經把許多話都告訴你了，現在你還不明白嗎？桂枝道：我明白，你是怕得罪哥哥，得罪了哥哥事情，就靠不住。不是我說一句藐視二爺的話，像你這樣一定靠着哥哥吃飯，一點事情也不敢作主，那倒不如乾乾脆脆和我斷絕丁關係的好。因爲你没有哥哥，就没有飯吃，别的事情那裏談得上呢。你别以爲你是個二老爺，比我們身分高了多少。可是我們雖然不成，自己還憑着目己十個指頭吃飯，若是像你那樣靠定了一個人們未必靠不着，而且老早的就發財了。哼│你瞧不起我，我才瞧不起你呢。這一陣冷嘲熱諷，把積之臊得滿臉通紅，對人是一句話也說不出來。桂枝冷笑道：你也没有什麽話可說了。你說的等你三年那句廢話，留着去騙别人罷，我不愛聽了。我今天是特意來找着你，回你一個信。說畢桂枝並不等他的回答，就這樣走了。積之站在路中間，望了桂枝背轉去的後影，覺得他後腦勺子都僵直起來，那是氣極了的表示。心裏這就想着，自從認識他以來，向没有聽到他說這種嚴重的言語·今天用這種話來指責，當然是他氣極了。然而他說的話，並不算過分自己實實在在是靠着哥哥過日子，是哥哥身上一個寄生蟲，他藐視我那是應該的。這話又說回來了，他是一個看得起我的人，都是這樣藐視我，此外的人·對我的議論，那是可想而知。我决不能就坦然受之的，讓人家去這樣藐視。我一定得齋鬥一下，做些成績給人看看。他這樣一路的思索着走到衙門裏來，辦事自然没不精神。厚之看到了，却把他呌到局長室裏去，當面教訓着道：這是衙門裏，不是家裏，在這裏拿薪水的人，都要打起精神來做事，若是每天寫個到，在這裏兒混一陣了事的人，我用他不着。誰要是這樣辦，誰就跟我滚出去。（八八）</p>

<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在過去俄羅斯的文學作家中，我非常喜歡榮霍甫·因爲從他的筆下，給我們留下了無數的當時俄國的知識階級的麥影·丨那些離心的，麻痒的，神經質的，虚無的。在各種塲合發着妙論的知識階級的形態丨</p>
<p>在現今的中國是比澲案甫時代的俄羅斯存在着更多的這樣知識階級的份子，然而我們没有像柴寗甫那樣的作家，所以没有人給我們留下這些秀識階級的肖像</p>
<p>現在讓我來舉一個例吧：前些天某跳舞塲開了一個××救國兼慶祝電影皇后的大會，這自然要有許多名人來號召或捧塲的，但所謂名人呢，不是官僚的知識階級，便是資本家的知識階級。於是有一個圓頭圓腦的先生出來講演了，其演講的大意是：［今天開這次盛大的××跳舞救國大會，一則爲的是慶祝××女士的當選電影皇后，二則是宣傳××救國的思想······］（其次是講了一大套××救國的理論）</p>
<p>但跳舞怎能救國呢？丨這位雄辯的先生便以身作則地繼續講起來：［諸君在各跳舞塲裏，時常可以看到我（筆者按：據有跳舞經䧔的人說，這位先生是每夜要輪流逛幾個跳舞塲的），殊不知我是另有一番苦心，近來一般靑年；醉心歐化·喜穿洋服，但我就到跳舞塲，也是穿中國貨的長袍·所以我的跳舞不是爲的娛樂，是想在這種最時髦的地方，宣傳長袍主義的愛國思想········］</p>
<p>［諸君，］我想接着這位先生講下去了；［你們覺得這演辭滑稽麽？可是類似這位先生的現今的中國的知識階級，是有着無數的呢，他們到處都在發着妙論。他們的行爲和言談，不是値行記錄下來留給我們的子孫看一看的麽？所以，我們應當怎樣期待看我們早日產生像柴霍甫那樣的一個作家，給我們來作這種工作呢丨］</p>

<p>假定第一種人是左，第二種人是右，第三種人是不左也不右，（第三種人的意議·其實是含有某程度的左傾的·但他和［同路人］還隔有相當距離。）則還有第四種人，這第四種人是又左也又右·可左也可右。</p>
<p>若問現在文壇裏究竟有没有這種又左又右的人存在呢？答曰有之·而且數量不少。</p>
<p>第四種人自然比第三種人高明得多。第三種人其實是儴子·第四種人却的的確確是聰明人。他們具有一關本領，見人說人話，見鬼說鬼話，有人戳穿他的時候·他可以說：[你不知道·這是策略·這是爲某種必要。］因此就無從對證·兩面都當他是自已人。</p>
<p>第四種人是時代之驕子，因爲現在這時代就不允許你單站在一方面。能左能右·可左可右，又左又右，因之你也拉他，我也拉他，而他在其間從容建築自己的地位，收獲雙倍的利益。</p>
<p>若把［騎牆派］的頭銜贈給第三種人，則我們可把［陰陽面］的徽號送給第四種人。兩者一比較，就可知道優勝劣敗的必然，騎在牆上的人顯然有使雙方不討好的危險，陰對陰陽對陽的人却可各投其所好·祇要當心不把陰陽面纏夾。</p>
<p>據說鏳四種人永遠是勝利的，我却還有一種大願·希望他們來領袖中國·又白又赤，别國猜不透我們的奥妙·大家當做同道·中國自然萬古永存了。</p>
<p>有人說這第四種人并不新奇。他們是拜官僚主義做老頭子的，而是眞正老牌的目前主義者，確否待考。</p>

<p>太太今天眞的生了氣，第一次把她那唯一的女兒駕了幾句。</p>
<p>但她駕的那幾句話没有打動女兒的心，却把自己累哭了。女兒長大到現在十九歲，從没斥責過一句，此刻說過了·倒好像有什麽對不起女兒似的，而且她自己覺得太傷心·這樣·她就哭了。</p>
<p>女兒到上海只讀了幾個月書，便變得這樣快。太太也見過許多世面的·上海這地方雖然繁華，好些人家把兒女送去，雖然有的變壞了，可是好的也多，像她表妹的兩個兒子多麽好·一個回來做律師，一個回來做醫生·一點没有學壞。壞的也有，太太總說是本性就壞的·没有怪過上海這地方太繁華。如今·上海眞的把她女兒變壞了，她才疑惑起來，這地方眞會累人的。</p>
<p>女兒穿得那麽漂亮·一點也看不出是學生，以前天眞的模樣，完全没有了。說話也没有心緒，老是想着什麽。一雙眼珠·失去了什麽東西似的·像夢遊病者一樣了。</p>
<p>去年榴花開的時候·大　計劃着到上海去讀書·說過許多偉大的話，太太覺得女兒會成功一個女政治家，女律師，或者是什麽文學家。今年假山脚下的榴花又開了，太太可失望啦，女兒是一步一步的離開了自己·走向一個黑的深淵去了。年輕的姑娘穿了那麽奇怪的衣裳，使用那麽多的化装東西，那裏再有餘裕幹正經的事呢。</p>
<p>『媽，你們是過時的人了，年靑人總歡喜這樣的』。</p>
<p>這句話眞使太太生氣了·雖然平時疼愛，到底忍不住駕了幾句。</p>

<p>— 江太蔚</p>
<p>［圭！我没有棉被像這樣的冷天，衣裏眞不好受。我看你底牀上有兩條，請你借給我一條，暫時使用好不好。一</p>
<p>是的，我本有兩條棉被。但自從接到文底信後，我底床上便少了一條了。我不是鄙吝的人，什麽都願意和册友共的；但道夫我把一條棉被给文拿走後，却感着深深的恨惘。</p>
<p>我時時想到那條棉被。牠和我的關係，實在太密切了。雖說是一條很壞的棉被，但是，我看到牠，便很興奮的記憶起許多不能志的往事。</p>
<p>自從十六歲陳開故鄰，在外間流浪的時候起，這棉被便是我最親密的月友，不諞是在檅濕陰暗的半獄襄，或是她寒交追的旅途中，我是水遠把牠放在身邊的。</p>
<p>記得當我離絲那年，母親在棉絮上加上許多線，一面縫着，一面對我說道··</p>
<p>［圭！你這次到外邊去，凡事要當心，乾脆讀幾句書吧，什麽事我也不想你去梓，你别再聞島什麽精來，旺親爲你會急得·····］母親說，你是聰明人，什麽也知道的呵！</p>
<p>現在母親在家里受苦，我半點都　　等　她，　　是每天天不亮的時候，便起來勞動的。而我呢，我還是東西南北的飄泊，便母親爲我操心！</p>
<p>我只是看到棉被，便馬上想起在家裏受苦的母親。</p>
<p>我爲什麽要把這條棉被給文拿去呢？那裏有我母親給我最好的教訓，戲着母親對我的愛愁與希冀！我眞痛恨自己！</p>
<p>前天，一個朋友走來，看着我底床上，笑着問我：</p>
<p>［那條棉被呢？］</p>
<p>［······］我底心刺痛着，没有什麽話回答。</p>
<p>。大約　　爲我的脸色　　　的　故事，朋友　立　　　着說訓創約　止　了。</p>
<p>·那天上午，那路又來［就價，着槍對，便知道又是文寫的，打開一看，這樣看着：</p>
<p>［圭！眞對不起你，你借給我的那條棉被，我把牠實去了，一共是二元，至少可以救濟我幾天困難，實在是無法，我才這麽做，你該不會埋怨我吧！到說你有兩條棉被，我帮你不着還有一條絨毯麽？我還希望你······］</p>
<p>他還希望我什麽？我把信一丢，躺在床上，心裏十分氣債。</p>

<p>— Jules　Kenaro作　　林取譯</p>
<p>這個會經輪流着養過鷄，兎子，猪的小屋子，現在己經空着，成爲紅蘿蔔鬚假期中獨有的產業了。這小屋子已經没有了門，他可以很方便地竄進去。門口長着一些脆弱的弊麻，紅蘿蔔鬚伏在地上瞧着，就像一座森林一樣。地上蓋着一層灰塵。四壁的磚石因爲潮濕，現得發亮的樣子。紅蘿蔔鬚把頭髮揩擦着屋頂。他在那裏就像在他自己的房子裏一樣，怡然自得。他對於許多玩具都不屑一顧，却盡力幻想着。他的主要的遊戲便是用臀部在小屋子裏的每一個角落掘下一個窝巢。他用着他的手掌像鐰一樣把灰塵集成一個圓圈，又把宅弄平。</p>
<p>背靠着光滑的牆壁，兩腿折疊着，雙手又放在膝上，樓身在那裏，他覺得很舒服。眞的，他不能把自己所佔的地方縮得再小了。他忘記了一切，他再不害怕什麽了。祗有一個晴天的　應才能把他驚擾起來。</p>
<p>廚房裏的洸碗水，由石槽的洞口放出，在離他不遠的地方流過，有時候滔滔地奔去，有時候一點一點地潘着，給他送來了一陣陣的熱氣。</p>
<p>突然，他接到一聲警報。</p>
<p>喊聲漸漸近了，速脚聲也聽到了。</p>
<p>［紅蘿蔔鬚？紅蘿蔔鬚？］</p>
<p>一個頭低下來了，於是紅蘿蔔鬚縮做圑，緊靠着牆土，屏息，張大了口，連目光都呆了，他覺得有兩顆眼睛在陰影中搜索着。</p>
<p>［紅蘿蔔鬚，你在這裏嗎？］</p>
<p>兩邊的太陽穴脹得高高的，他拚命忍住。他快要放出慘痛的呼放了。［他没有在這裏，這小畜生。這東西究竟到那裏去了？］尋的人走還了，於是紅蘿蔔鬚的身子稍爲鬆了一鬆，又怡然自得了。</p>
<p>他的思想又在沉默中邀遊了許久。</p>
<p>但他的兩耳突然充滿了一種喧噪。一雙注蒼蠅被屋頂上的一個蜘蛛網信了，鼓着翼在掙扎。蜘蛛沿着一根絲溜下來。它的肚子現着麵包屑似的黃白色。它在半空中停了一會，躊躍着，一任自己啣着的那條蛛絲在空中旋轉。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把臀部頂起，集急地窺視着，當那可怕的蜘蛛躍向敵人，用小脚把蛛縐封鎖了，把那捕獲着的食物抓住了的時候，紅蘿蔔鬚興奮地站了起來，就像要分取一杯　似的。可是並没有進一步的行動。</p>
<p>蜘蛛又跑上去了。紅蘿蔔鬚又坐了下來，他又凝神靜氣，從事默想。一會兒，他的空想正像一線被砂子濾過來的水一樣，因爲没有地　洩，便停下來，形成一圑澆水，澆住不動了。</p>
<p>黏</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚聽見人家說·做釣鯉子的餌食，再没有什麽比得上貓肉綁樣好的，不讑是鷄羅或豬牛的零件都没有那樣好。</p>
<p>他當好認讓一匹猫，因爲老且病，到處脫着毛。受人横惡。紅蘿蔔鬚便把牠邀到他家裏，邀到那小屋子裏去吃一杯牛乳。在那裏是不會有第三者來參與的。或者會有一雙老鼠跑出牆來也說不定，可是紅蘿蔔議　等應給牠一杯牛乳。他把那杯牛乳旗在一個角上。他把貓送到角上說道：</p>
<p>［儘量吃罷。］</p>
<p>他撫摸着牠的脊骨，給牠種種温柔的名稱，注說着牠那樣敏捷地用舌子舐吃着牛乳，隐較他竟感動起來了：</p>
<p>［司憐的老晉生啊，把剩下的通通吃光罷。］</p>
<p>貓把牛乳全吃完了，用舌子掃着杯底，措着杯邊，隨後便祇剩下牠那具有甜味的嘴唇了。［司憐的老畜生啊，把剩下的通通吃光罷。］</p>
<p>貓把牛乳全吃完了，用舌子掃着杯底，指着杯邊，隨後便祇剩下牠那具有甜味的嘴唇了。［你吃完了嗎，通通完了嗎？］紅蘿蔔鬚問，照舊撫摸牠。［當然啦，你一定很高興再喝一杯的；可是我没有能够偷到第一杯。並且。不論運或早······說到這裏，他便把獵槍的槍口擱在貓的額角上，開了一槍。（未完）</p>

<p>我見了這個電報·忽然發生一種感想，我本來反對迷信·反對吃素念佛，非但反對，并且一看吃素念佛等種種迷信舉勸，便要破口大駡，駡他無意識，駡他阿木林·但是翻轉來想想·到底不差，故現在湯薌銘等虔誠念佛·我非但不反對，而且極端贊成。</p>
<p>我佛慈悲·救苦救難，但是佛到底是出世主義的，而不是入世主義的，所以只能救後世的苦難，而不能救目前的苦難，一個人住在世界上，若感覺得没有味道，并且得了許多說不出的種種痛苦，就覺得做人無謂，便要想到一佛出世·二佛湼縏，今生不好，便要修來世好，今世不寫意，便想修來世冩意，我輩做人做到現在，也算無味極了，坍臺極了，今世無望，只有修來世，眞是［阿彌陀佛］。</p>
<p>但是要修，非先定一個目標不可，這個問題·不免使我考慮了幾天·定下列的幾個原則，第一個困難問題，就是後世去做人的好呢，還是不做人的好，如其做人，當做怎樣的人，如其不做人，當做怎樣動物，以下幾點，就是我要修行而假定的幾個標準。</p>
<p>我第一要修，做一個有財有勢的人，假使一旦失勢，弄到内地不能住，便住租界做個庽公，亭子間不住天然要住洋房，狗頭車不坐，天然要坐黑牌汽車，假定租界住不得，便跑到外國去，做外國庽公，做人做到如此，總算寫意·所以我起初要修這樣的人，但是仔細想來，總不大妥當·到底面子上不大好看·因此作罷·絕對不修。</p>
<p>我第二·要修做一個外國人·但是埃及印度等外人不要做，我立志要做英美德法等强國的國民·可以一吐我胸中一肚皮烏氣，但是弱國的人，有弱國的困難，强國的人，亦有强國的尷𠆷，往往勾心鬥角·你猜我忌，在這縱横椑闔的當兒，亦有幾許難言之隱，做外國人也未必怎樣一定開心，所以我也拒絕不修。</p>
<p>我第三要修不要做人，因爲做人，總是有腦筋的·有知覺的，有了腦筋，有了知覺·總有感覺不寫意的地方，所以我决計後世不去做人·只去做隻狗·</p>
<p>并且不要做中國的拘，一定要做外國的狗，因爲做中國人不寫意，做中國的狗天然更不寫意，不願去做，若做外國的狗·天天蹲在洋大人洋太太身邊，搖頭龐尾，威風凛凛，何等開心呢·所以我决計後世修做一只外國狗。</p>

<p>丨淸道夫的回憶丨</p>
<p>［由那樣一種興奮的生活，轉變成這樣淸道的苦役·一半是要歸咎於東洋兵·一半却只好說。自己的命實在太苦了，而且年事也不行了。但，與其迷迷的在］謎］中老混，倒不如乾脆點自苦自吃呵丨］</p>
<p>一個五十來歲了的淸道夫，傴僂着身體，花白的頭髮，在街邊一面慢慢的掃地，一面不停的抹拭額角上的汗點。若是回轉去十年，汗是不大出的，就是出，也往往任他一顆一顆的溜到鼻樑，溜進唇口，用舌頭一舐，只感到喝鹽水似的一種鹹味。現在却不知怎樣鹹味中平添了苦性，所以他要一把一把的把他抹拭掉。</p>
<p>十字路口的紅路燈一開，螞蟻似的汽車嗚嗚地馳來街心的人便向兩面擠開，他也就偷懶把掃帚一摔，蹲下路的背灣角裊，吐掉幾口白沫，喘着氣休息，在這片刻的休息裏，他每每回憶到許多的往事：</p>
<p>［三十五歲那年，從一將機器店裏轉進兵工廠，被派進機關槍廠，專門做機關槍的開手，雖然做手不多，每日也可做好五架，做好了，試放一過，便連同他項槍枝，運上小火車，開到南站，再轉運到京師，一天天的做，一批批的的用塲到底怎樣？</p>
<p>每當國家起了亂子，南兵要打北兵了，或是北兵打向南方來了，各界都不免恐慌，紗廠要減工，商店要出淸存貨。而我們的和生活，却反而增優，日夜雙班，只要性命熬得住，日夜二十四小時你都可以不停的做，趕急的做，趕急的運。這時我才稍稍秀過機關槍原是戰時掃射的利器，而且知道是運去掃射北兵或南兵去了。</p>
<p>有一次亂子來得更凶·上峯傳下命令·說是在十天之内，無論是星期·夜間，都不准停機。若是熬不住，儘可自由找帮手，工錢由廠裏負担。原是所向無敵的革命軍打來的，需要多量的槍彈去堵戰。到了第五天，忽然盒子槍廠停工了，並且全廠發現了什麽宣言傳單，大家哄然，說是解除民衆痛苦的革命軍到了，我們還製造槍械去堵戰麽？只有罷工歡迎的道理。</p>
<p>經過這一個哄動時期，革命軍果然到了於是我們的廠裏平添了一個工會，於是大家又依舊過着先前的生活，一天天的做，一批批的運，運到何處去了？作何用塲？一如往昔般的茫然。其後又經過幾次緊張的緊工時期，却又不見有什麽新的革命軍打來。</p>
<p>自東洋兵佔去了瀋陽·說是那面的兵工廠被燒掉了·成批的機匠都向上少海逃，都向我們的廠裏來請願，要求收容。不知怎樣，當時我們的廠裏，却取緊縮政策，雖然我們自家的生活，還没有恐慌的消息傳來，夜工當然是不用做了。臨到東洋兵向閘北燒殺起來了，却是我們的刦數到了，一道命令下來是减工，二道命令下來是停工，等到第三道命令下來後，便是我們的生活完結，工廠關門。</p>
<p>當我離開機廠時，仰看天空的東洋飛機，拚命用機關槍向下　掃，更使我强烈的感到機關槍原是戰時的利器。但我們的工廠却關了門·好像到了抗日反帝的時候，倒不需要什麽機關槍了似的，這是一個多大的［謎］呵。］</p>
<p>［謎］永遠是一個［謎］，他理解不透，當嗚嗚的汽車馳過了，街邊的人散開了，他又自吃自苦的拿着掃帚慢慢地淸道去了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>前次的信·蒙你指示我丨也可以說指示靑年們丨至少在我個人·是非常感謝的。現在又來麻煩你了·想必不至於拒絕吧？昨天和廠中一位機匠閒談，無意中談到宗教方面去；不料他竟竭力向我宣傳［耶穌的道理］了丨原來他是一個基督教徒，自然　，基督教在鄙人勢力之下，是日益擴大，蔓延到中國内地了，在　　　傳　中·時常會有一二個傳教徒·他們壁上帝耶穌］·深深地印入了天眞的孩子們的腦中·這是多麽深則的用意啊丨在上海呢？基督教又是多麽風行呵！好像入基督教是新時代人們應有的表現·基督教是多麽摩登化？不如此·你就好像是落伍了·誰甘落伍呢？入基督教才是識時務而緊跟着時代前進啊！</p>
<p>他丨機匠丨對我說：他如何信耶穌教丨耶穌就是基督，基督如何醫好他多年的癆病，並戒了他的賭·和吸烟············還舉了許多證據·好像萬能的基督·就在目前一般！一方面呢？却說佛教是［迷信］的·是愚笨的，只有入基督教，才能登［天堂］·不會入［地獄］受苦了！···········他的話，滔滔不絕，總之他是基督教徒，當然是替基督教宣傳了。可是我以爲，他的話是絕端的矛盾！因爲基督教有［天國］，難道就不許佛教有［天堂］嗎？基督是萬能的上帝，釋迦牟尼就不能說是萬能的菩薩了嗎？信佛是迷信，然而信耶教，未嘗不是迷信。他們念經跪拜·你們禱告禮拜，不也樣嗎？一樣的迷信，又有什麽誰是迷信，誰不是迷信？不過我想信，無論什麽教，至少他的宗旨是可取的。耶穌呌人走正路，做好人；佛教不也是呌人爲善嗎？在當初這主旨是多麽純正啊丨可是後來的信教者，只知其然，而不知其所以然，盲目地念着經，或禱告着；他們又那裏知道，這正是恐怕後人不信服，才寄言什麽上帝菩薩，賴着虚無漂渺的大自然，來使你信服，使你不再作惡。現在以毫釐之差，竟會有人盲目地只是迷信着登［天堂］去！這又豈是創始者的初意呢？至於外人的傳教。究抱什麽主義，那我可不得而知·大槪不會有好意吧。話太多了，恐怕已越出了通信的範圍之外了吧？先生！你以爲如何，請你不吝指教爲荷。最後，我要聲明，我不信什麽教，這純以勞觀者的立塲來說話。並不是有意指摘基督教或和佛教呀丨請不在誤會丨祝你撲安會仲星謹上</p>

<p>編者按：宗教爲時代上過去的東西我們知道·自有人類以來，除在有史以前的洪荒時代·我們無從考證外；降及上古及中古時代·其時人類尙少·謀生較易，人類對於生活上必需的物質·比較容易滿足。但是社會的進化·全靠人類的［不滿］一念·爲其推進的原動力。於是當時的一班先知先覺者，創爲第二世界之說·裨人類的努力，可有其目標。各種宗教就是這種產物；所以耶教有天堂地獄之說，佛教也有天堂地獄之說，推而至於其他一切宗教，莫非也是使人類在爲其一生的衣食而努力之外，更爲了這虚無漂渺的第二世界而努力。這就是所謂唯心時代。</p>
<p>但是到了近世，生齒日繁，生存競爭，日趨尖銳化。人類對於生活上必需的物質，即使竭其一生努力·尙有無法滿足之苦。爲了飢寒所迫，不得不彼此略奪，雖有嚴刑峻法·尙不足使其有畏懼之心，何况這種虚無漂渺的第二世界的懲罰呢？那當然完全失其效用了。到此時代·［唯心論］已爲［唯物論］所戰敗；一切宗教，也就成爲强弩之末了。明乎這個道理，我們就可以知道，一切的宗教，到了現在，均已無存在的餘地。那末現在的教會·爲什麽又在那裏風行呢？我們應當知道·現在的宗教·已經失却了牠的眞面目，而成爲帝國主義者，用以麻醉人羣·而實行其侵略的工具了。你不看見·一樣有價値的宗教，因爲没有人利用的綠故，就日漸式㣲了嗎！</p>
<p>我們現在應該看透一切宗教的虚僞，打倒一切唯心史觀的產物；惟有唯物論才能解决我們的生活，才能指示我們的出路！</p>

<p>— 凌編</p>
<p>二十·新生活的開始</p>
<p>這對於她的確又是一種新的嘗試，事實上她又換了新的主人了。然而最使她覺得高興的便是有夠經常的和張文彬在一道，衹要蘇部長没有空時間守住她的時候·她便將張文彬藏到自己的房裏去，儼然是新婚夫婦似的·擁抱一通又笑謔一回，到也淸閒自在。</p>
<p>由於這幾天的日夜相處·關於張文彬的一切：現在她算懂得更多了。加之他也更加放縱起來，簡直是無所不談，於是她知道他是北京大學畢業不久的大學生，所以他的出身也很不俗。現在是外交部的一等科員，假如比較起前淸的官銜，至少是在五品以上。年靑靑的·居然如此發逹·當然很不容易。還有一點最値得·五夫人高興的，便是他直到現在還没有正式夫人·雖然從前也有過一個黃臉老婆，但是不久便死了；這樣看來，假如自己能夠好好的待他，不成問題，他是很可以一心一意的跟着自己一世的。至於說到他的才能，那是更不消說得，即在學生時代，也曾轟轟烈烈的幹過一下，那年北京打曹汝霖章宗祥，他就是其中最激烈的一個。固然不一定因爲這樣一來便成了歷史上的人物，可是一提起過去的功勛，他到也興高彩烈的滿身是勁的哩。正因爲如此·五夫人才覺得現在是幸福的開始：他是如此年輕，而且又如此熱情，像這樣的男人，在她的生活中當然增加了不少生氣·於是她以爲現在才是有意義的人生了。</p>
<p>一想到這裏，不由的十分興奮，甚至於滿身發熱起來，於是走到床邊，凝望着他那健康的睡容，情不自禁的俯下身去緊緊的抱着他的頭，重重的吻着他的嘴唇·一股濃厚的熱情，使她心頭感受着極大壓力的麻痺。她自己知道得非常淸楚·在任何男性的體温中，她從來没有激發起如此濃重的快感。一陣秋風吹動了窗前的簾慢。</p>
<p>當她抬起頭來的時候·張文彬自然是給她吻醒了。他半張着眼皮，望着她甜密的微笑·可是翻了一個身·又朝裏面沉沉的睡去了。這時候五夫人不免有點傷心·她知道這這是近幾天來太不知道節慾的原故。</p>
<p>於是她立刻喊着荷香說：</p>
<p>［家裏不是還有多着的燕窝嗎？你好好給我燉一碗·要乾凈。］［誰吃？］荷香又在故意俏皮了。［你管不着！］她也笑笑的似乎要生氣了</p>
<p>［我當然管不着囉·可是回頭老爺問起來·［給誰吃？］我將怎麽回話呢？］五夫人正預備睜着眼睛駡她幾句，只見武貴滿頭是汗的跑來說：［快丨快丨老爺來了。］於是五夫人一翻足馬上跑進房門，荷香史是不是二七二十一的將嚴文彬扶將起來，連拉帶扯的將他幾回他是的　房裏去更正一五姬的量零小說。昨天所○○節應載在（今申）二十節之後因爲誤排·恃此更正。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Xiong Bin and Six Other Representatives Arrive in Tianjin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the signing of the truce agreement, our troops have completed their withdrawal. Regarding the disposition of the puppet troops in eastern Luan, our representatives raised the issue at the Tanggu conference, but a detailed decision was not reached. Further consultations between the two sides are pending. Our representatives Xiong Bin, Xu Yanmou, Lei Shourong, Zhang Xiyuan, Li Zeyi, and five others departed for Tianjin this morning. Qian Zongze went yesterday. The six representatives will immediately hold earnest consultations with the Japanese military in Tianjin to seek a quick resolution. In addition to handling the puppet troops, this consultation will also address restoring traffic between Ping and Yu, and receiving the various localities within the withdrawn troop areas. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a certain important person, the Japanese army has not yet withdrawn. Judging by their intentions, they seem to be adopting a rapid withdrawal method to throw the local area into chaos, increasing the difficulty of our reception. As for how to deal with the troops of Li Jichun, Zhao Lei, and others, the Japanese side has not yet expressed a definite stance. If this matter is not resolved, even if the Japanese army withdraws, it will be difficult for us to take over. The circumstances of this truce agreement are different from those of the Shanghai truce agreement. There is no need to organize a reception committee. In the future, the provincial government will select county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs to thoroughly investigate and rectify the situation. The previous police force was too corrupt, and it is now planned to disband them all and form a new security police force specifically responsible for suppressing bandits. Each county will only need one hundred to three hundred officers. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiong Bin arrived in Tianjin from Ping by special train on the afternoon of the second. It is said to be to negotiate with the Japanese side on measures to stop the activities of Chinese traitors. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiong Bin and five other representatives went to Tianjin. This trip is to discuss with Japanese representatives on how to deal with the puppet troops in the Luandong area. According to the Japanese side, these troops do not belong to (Manchukuo). (Second Reuters Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the recovery of lost territories within the Guan, there are reports that it will be jointly organized by the Military Affairs Commission, the provincial government, and the Political Readjustment Committee. According to relevant sources, the committee has not yet been organized, and the establishment of a reception committee is still out of the question. Moreover, it is a local matter and can be handled by local authorities. This morning, He Yingqin has dispatched Xiong Bin, Xu Zuyi, Zhang Xiguang, and others to Tianjin to visit Yu Xuezhong to discuss measures for receiving the lost territories, so as to prepare for completion as soon as possible. Once the Japanese army begins to withdraw, we will gradually take over. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Government yesterday instructed the county magistrates of Yutian, Fengrun, Zunhua, Changli, Jianping, Qian'an, Lulong, Baodi, Jixian, Sanhe, and other counties to await orders in the provincial capital, so that they can be dispatched to their respective counties at any time for reception. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three important members of the Japanese Embassy who participated in the conference accompanied Xiong Bin and others to Tianjin today. After Xiong and others arrive in Tianjin, they will contact Yu Xuezhong and Japanese military commander Nakamura. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army withdraws from the Great Wall, it will cease reconnaissance flights. The truce agreement will be abolished after formal Sino-Japanese negotiations. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>=Japanese Warship Escorts Traitors to Tianjin=</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese transport ship Yi Ping Maru escorted Ma Tingfu and An Fukui to Tianjin from Tanggu on the first. On the morning of the second, it also transported two or thirty plainclothes troops from the Japanese concession to Tanggu. Shi Yousan is recruiting many unemployed workers from the railway and mines in Taiping Island, who are undergoing unarmed training and do not yet have firearms. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>=Traitors Have Not Ceased Activities=</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The plainclothes unit in the Japanese concession, a force directly commanded by the Japanese, has been given severance pay and disbanded. However, many firearms have not been recovered. The Japanese police station is sincerely afraid of disturbing the peace and has been conducting strict searches. Ordinary traitors have not ceased their activities, but they have changed from public enemies to private enemies. As long as they do not hinder the Japanese's aggressive interests, the Japanese side will still secretly assist them. Therefore, the local authorities' vigilance has not dared to be relaxed in the slightest. (Second Daily Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Statement of the Course of the War of Resistance in North China</p>
<h3 id="e2">And the Heartfelt Reason for Having to Sign the Truce Agreement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the signing of the North China Truce Agreement, it was originally scheduled for the National Government to issue a declaration on the second. Later, according to the current government organizational law, the Executive Yuan is a responsible cabinet system, so the Central Committee decided to change it to a circular telegram to the whole country in the name of Wang Zhaoming, the head of the Executive Yuan, stating the course of the War of Resistance in North China and the heartfelt reasons for having to sign the Truce Agreement. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will translate the full text into English and send it to various countries. The full text is scheduled to be released at 9:00 PM on the second. (Second Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Premier Wang's circular telegram on the second regarding the truce stated the following: "To the chairmen of the provincial governments, mayors, and directors of pacification offices: Since the loss of Rehe, our army has fought against the Japanese army in the Great Wall area to defend and recover lost territories. Relying on the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers and the people's exhaustion of their resources, we have fought hard for three months without the slightest slackening. During this period, the Miao Chengliu division in the Battle of Lamadong and the Song Zheyuan army in the Battle of Xifengkou were able to sacrifice heroically, unafraid of a powerful enemy. And the recent Battle of Nantianmen, in which the Central Committee dispatched various divisions, resulting in more than half of the casualties, was especially tragic. It was only because the Japanese army held superior offensive weapons, such as heavy artillery, tanks, and bombing planes, and inflicted them on our soldiers fighting with flesh and blood, that they were forced to retreat strategically after the positions were destroyed. Moreover, aerial bombing was not only carried out on the positions but also extended to non-combatant civilians, resulting in the destruction of lives and the destruction of homes. On May 22nd and 23rd, the Japanese army approached Pingjin, where the population is dense and foreigners are mixed, and people were shocked several times a night by such brutal actions, and refugees flooded the roads, eagerly hoping for a mitigation measure to avoid disaster. While the government encouraged the soldiers to continue their efforts and do their best to defend, it also established a minimum limit for the truce movement, allowing for a partial truce if it does not harm China's territorial sovereignty and various conventions concerning world peace. The North China truce negotiations have now been signed by the military representatives in the front. Examining the text, the hidden pain is deep, but it is only military and does not involve politics, and it does not affect the government's long-held fundamental policy. At this time of crisis of survival, the government can only strengthen itself, supervise the military and civilians, and make various efforts in diplomacy and national defense according to the established policy, in order to obtain a just solution. I respectfully submit this summary for your consideration. Wang Zhaoming, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Winter." (Second Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The Chahar Problem <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Zi</p>
<p>After the signing of the North China Truce Agreement, the situation in Pingjin was able to be temporarily stabilized at the cost of a demilitarized zone of 5,000 square miles west of the Yanqing-Lutai line. Thereafter, the focus of the situation shifted to the Chahar problem. The creators of the Chahar problem are: first, Feng Yuxiang's telegram on the 26th of last month in the provincial capital of Chahar, Wanquan County (Zhangjiakou), assuming the post of commander-in-chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, declaring martial law to protect Chahar Province and then recover lost territories. Leaving aside the domestic impact of this incident, its military relationship with the Japanese army shows, on the one hand, that Chahar Province is not within the scope of the truce and bears the sole responsibility for continuing the war of resistance and recovering lost territories; on the other hand, it gives the Japanese army another target for combat to actively carry out its military advance south from Dolon. Under this form, if Feng does not have the strength to develop, then the seriousness of the Zhangjiakou problem is feared to be no less than the Pingjin problem before the signing of the truce agreement. The second is that the truce agreement did not involve the military affairs between Dolon and Guyuan. The general statement of the truce agreement issued by the Central News Agency, "The truce and withdrawal of troops northwest begins at Yanqing County in the southeast corner of Chahar Province," is because of the relationship between Yanqing and the Japanese army attacking westward from Gubeikou. However, the agreement did not mention a single word about the Dolon-Guyuan line north of Yanqing. What is the intention? We cannot speculate. In the future, under the so-called North China Truce Agreement, the Japanese army can capture Guyuan and approach Zhangjiakou, as the truce agreement has nothing to do with the war on this route.</p>
<p>The above is not our paranoid observation. The Reuters Tianjin telegram on June 1st already stated that "The signing of the truce agreement can free up a large part of the Japanese army... for the purpose of capturing the Zhangjiakou area." Today, there is also news that the Japanese army is preparing to advance into Guyuan. Since gaining Jehol, the Japanese army has advanced in two directions. It goes without saying that the line of the Great Wall has completed its military role. Moreover, the Japanese military's desire to occupy Chahar Province and acquire Zhangjiakou has already been clearly stated by its military personnel.</p>
<p>The creation of the Chahar problem has become quite mature. What we want to show today is whether the handling of this aspect in the future will be solely borne by Feng, who is revealing his armed protection of Chahar Province, or whether the military leaders in North China, who signed the truce agreement, will provide assistance. The highway from Dolon to Zhangjiakou is 277 kilometers long. Now half of it is in the hands of the Japanese army. If the Japanese army advances for two more days, it will reach Zhangyuan. At that time, will Beiping, about 200 kilometers away from Zhangyuan, be exempted from any impact by the role of the truce agreement? Or will it still be invaded by an atmosphere of unease because the Japanese army controls its northern side?</p>

<p>Yokotake Commercial Officer Has Been Ordered to Quickly Take Office in Shanghai</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the 918 Incident, Sino-Japanese relations have been in turmoil, followed by turmoil. The establishment of this truce agreement has gradually led to the development of the situation. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida intends to take this opportunity to abandon the policy of non-involvement that has been adopted towards China, and switch to an active pro-China policy. He has ordered the foreign ministry leadership, centered on Vice Minister Chongguang, to draft a new policy toward China. As soon as the draft is completed in the coming days, he will issue an important telegram to Ambassador Arigio, ordering him to go north to implement the new policy. (Second Electrical Communication Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Because a truce agreement has been established between China and Japan, Chinese sentiment toward Japan is gradually easing, and trade is gradually picking up. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to take this opportunity to reopen commerce between the two countries, and has ordered Yokotake, the commercial officer who is currently returning to the country, to return to his post as soon as possible and take charge of commercial affairs. Yokotake has taken the plan to increase staff in the Shanghai office, and yesterday left Kobe by convenient wheel to return to Shanghai to take office.

It intends to request the government to increase subsidies in the next fiscal year.

<p>(Geneva) The subcommittee organized by the League of Nations to deal with the issue of not recognizing [Manchukuo] met this morning to discuss the secretariat's report on the plan not to recognize [Manchukuo]. The subcommittee passed the plan, with slight modifications. Some discussions arose regarding the issue of not allowing [Manchukuo] to join the Olympic Games and the Davis Cup tennis competition, but the proposal to exclude [Manchukuo] was ultimately rejected because it was too naive, and because the organization of the Olympic Games is purely a private matter. The report will be submitted to the plenary session of the League of Nations Advisory Committee next Wednesday for discussion and will now be distributed to various governments in the form of a notice for review. (Second Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The British Industry Association's special investigation committee submitted a report to the Ministry of Commerce today, stating that the increasingly turbulent situation caused by Japanese competition in the world market estimates that the Japanese population will increase by 15 million to 20 million in the next two or three decades.

Japan is now using all the methods it can to dump its goods and defeat its competitors. At present, the affected British goods are not only rayon and cotton fabrics, but also heavy chemicals, electric lights, bicycles, buttons, cement, rubber shoes, etc. The Japanese competition is also gradually increasing.

<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun of May 24th, Japan, internationally isolated after withdrawing from the League [of Nations], is subject to various reconnaissance networks deployed by various countries. Japan is mobilizing both within and outside its national defense lines in preparation for emergencies. Starting in early February, Mr. and Mrs. Crowe, secretaries at the British Embassy in Japan, were found photographing in the Yokosuka fortress area. After being discovered by the chauffeur, Kumazawa, they were reprimanded and released by the Tokyo Bay Fortress Command. On March 19th, the secretary and his wife again trespassed into the Misaki fortress area's watch post and engaged in some unlawful activity. Fortunately, they were discovered by the military police. Due to their diplomatic status, they were immediately released. On April 30th, they again entered an important area of the Arasaki coast in Nagai Town and were driven out by the artillery battery guards. Unexpectedly, on May 13th, they went to a certain area of Arasaki for reconnaissance and were seen by a vigilant naval officer. It was discovered that this couple repeatedly trespassed into the fortress area, acting secretively and moving about unpredictably. Therefore, the military police are very angry about their various actions, and the Foreign Ministry has lodged a serious protest with the British Ambassador.</p>

<p>(Chengdu) All officers and soldiers of the 28th Army issued a joint telegram on the 1st, stating that the Sichuan war has been going on for nearly a month, and Liu Wenhui is truly the instigator of the rebellion, as is known by everyone in the country. Liu Wenhui took advantage of the Sichuan army's suppression of the Communists to disrupt the rear of the anti-Communist army without justification. He was cursed by all, and he is trying to conceal his crime of initiating the chaos by confusing the truth. The telegram falsely accused Huang's division of having hidden dissenting sentiments. After investigation, the division and brigade commanders and all the officers and soldiers of Huang's unit are all loyal and have not been heard to have any adverse influences for several years. Liu Wenhui, having exhausted his reasons and arguments, hastily made irresponsible statements, reversing black and white, in order to deceive the Central Government and mislead the public. However, ten eyes and ten hands cannot cover up the truth, and it is not enough to block the mouths that can melt gold and dissolve bones. Now he has ordered a general offensive against our army on all fronts, while superficially singing the praises of peace. He outwardly complies with Chairman Chiang's order to cease fire and return to defense, but in reality, he disobeys it, which shows that his treacherous ambition has not yet waned. The facts are obvious, and there is no need to argue. However, for the sake of clarity, we hereby make it public to the people of the country, etc. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>

In order to provide relief, the government has ordered the Hankou Banking Association and the Chamber of Commerce to discuss solutions with tea merchants' organizations. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Dispute over the Military Supervision System</p>
<p>France's Amendment Meets with Sole Objection from Japan</p>
<p>The National News Agency in Paris, 1st - The focus of the military disarmament negotiations has now clearly shifted to the French capital, Paris, as French Foreign Minister Peng Gu and US representative Davis both departed Geneva for Paris late tonight. It is rumored that they will meet with British Foreign Secretary Simon there to further discuss the reduction of land armaments.</p>
<p>The National News Agency in Geneva, 1st - Today, the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference completed the first reading of the British draft disarmament convention. Prior to this, there was debate among the nations on the minor details of the draft, specifically regarding the establishment of a permanent administrative committee to supervise the disarmament progress of each country. The French representative, who previously held a conservative attitude towards the reduction of various armaments, suddenly proposed many reduction proposals today, and Poland and the countries of the Little Entente enthusiastically supported them. However, representatives from other countries did not vote on them, awaiting detailed examination, so the outcome will only be clear after the second reading. However, German representative Nadolny stated that Germany would accept any administrative method approved by other countries. Following this, Chairman Henderson moved to adjourn the meeting until Tuesday, at which time the first reading will be voted on.</p>
<p>The National News Agency in Geneva, 1st - The Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference suddenly decided last night to adjourn the General Committee until June 27th and replace the General Committee in conducting the second reading of the British draft disarmament agreement, causing a highly excited discussion among the members of the General Committee today. More than 20 representatives participated. After a long debate, it was decided to accept the decision of the Steering Committee, but with several reservations: 1. The General Committee should reopen no later than July 3rd. 2. Chairman Henderson should be responsible for the negotiations between the governments of various countries that will begin. 3. Whether the British proposal is not only the basis for future discussions but also the basis for the disarmament convention should be resolved at the final meeting of the first reading.</p>
<p>The National News Agency in Geneva - Today, representatives of all countries in the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, except Japan, accepted France's proposal for effective and continuous supervision of armaments. The French representative strongly advocated that only the implementation of continuous inspection and supervision can ensure that armaments do not exceed the quantities stipulated in international conventions. US representative Davis accepted this proposal, declaring that the United States was happy to see the operation of an inspection mechanism, with its only reservation being not to force the United States to impose military sanctions on treaty violators. Japan raised a general reservation regarding the supervision proposal.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, 1st, Geneva - The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, examining the chapter on supervision in the British proposal, French representative Paul-Boncour presented France's amendment, the main purpose of which is to make the supervision system implemented on the spot, regularly, automatically, and permanent in nature. When a violation of the disarmament convention occurs, the safety of anyone who exposes it in good faith should be guaranteed. Representatives from Norway (Lange), the United States (Davis), Switzerland (Motta), and the Czech Republic, Poland, Finland, and other countries all supported the French amendment. The Czech representative spoke on behalf of the Little Entente countries. The British representative intended to express his opinion at the second reading. The German representative, Nadolny, did the same. The Dutch representative and Soviet Russian representative Litvinov both supported the French amendment. The French representative, seeing that so many countries supported France's proposal, stood up to thank them, saying that the progress of the international idea of supervising armaments can be seen here over the years. Paul-Boncour thanked the UK in particular for including the supervisory organization in the British plan, believing that from the speeches of the representatives, it can be seen that the Disarmament Conference will accept a supervision system that is implemented on the spot, automatically, and permanent in nature. However, in order to ensure the consistency of the entire text, some reservations must be made. Once the supervision system is implemented, the suspicion and antipathy between countries will be reduced to a minimum, and equal rights will be seen in practice, as each country can monitor what its neighbors are doing. This can be seen especially in Davis's speech. Representatives from Japan, Italy, and Hungary declared that their countries would pay attention to the study of the French proposal.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Four-Power Pact: A Long and Uncertain Dream <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Germany Proposes Conditions Detrimental to the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Russian Newspaper Reveals New British Anti-Soviet Plan</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 1st - Germany has proposed several conditions for accepting the Four-Power Pact that are detrimental to the Disarmament Conference. In other words, these conditions are inconsistent with the views that France has consistently advocated in Geneva. Therefore, it will take some time before the Four-Power Pact can be signed. Furthermore, since British Foreign Secretary Simon and Italian representative Aloisi left Geneva, Paul-Boncour has not conducted any negotiations on the Four-Power Pact. The latest text proposed by Rome was only received in Paris in the last 48 hours. Reuters, London, 1st - British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons today that documents concerning the Four-Power Pact, detailing its origins, will be published as a white paper. However, the exact form of these documents has not yet been fully decided.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 1st - The Pravda newspaper here stated that although the second draft of the Four-Power Pact is vastly different from the original draft, Britain's policy of intervention has not changed in the slightest. The newspaper continued that British conservatives are using all their power to control the fate of all of Europe and are exploiting the deepening contradictions of the Treaty of Versailles to pursue their selfish desires. First, they hope that the war between the imperialist countries on the issue of the Treaty of Versailles can be avoided today. Second, they attempt to perform their duties as impartial judges of the relationship between France and its allies and Germany. Third, they are willing to close the eastern road to German fascism and point out its activities to proceed in this direction. Pravda concluded that the saviors of London no longer have hope of using the League of Nations. They are prepared to abandon the League of Nations and create another institution to replace it. This new institution will be more suitable for Britain to implement its diplomatic policies, especially its policy of intervention against the Soviet Union. However, whether the new anti-Soviet plan will succeed cannot be determined solely by Britain's advances and retreats.</p>

<p>A Havas dispatch from Prague reports that after the third (and final) meeting of the Permanent Political Council of the Little Entente nations, a communiqué was issued focusing on the establishment of a tripartite economic conference. This conference will establish a branch in each nation, totaling three branches. Each branch will have five members, assisted by a considerable number of experts. Each branch can also be divided into several committees based on specific issues, such as commercial policy, agricultural issues, industrial issues, financial issues, and transportation issues, with committee members appointed to each. Each national branch should prepare specific proposals. The three branches should jointly convene at least four times a year, rotating among the capitals of the three nations, to organize the independent work of each branch and submit joint recommendations to the Permanent Political Council. According to the Little Entente nations, international politics have been unified since the treaties were signed in Geneva. The proposed economic conference aims to seek economic solidarity among the three nations beyond political unity.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Morgan Bank Case <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>A Startling Development</p>
<p>Secrets of Partnership Agreement Disclosed</p>
<p>Arguments Over Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 1st reports a startling development in the investigation of the Morgan Bank. A man claiming to be a former Deputy Police Commissioner of New York City, Mr. Hackett, today accused Mr. Pecora, the legal counsel of the Senate Banking Committee, of handing over a small book detailing Mr. Pecora's improper handling of the Jin murder case when he was a District Attorney in 1923. Upon hearing this accusation, Mr. Pecora stated that he was willing to thoroughly investigate the case. This afternoon, the Morgan Company's partnership agreement was released. This agreement was drafted on March 31, 1916, after the death of the founder of the Morgan Company, the elder Morgan. It stipulates that if conflicts arise among shareholders, they must abide by the decision of the major shareholder, Morgan. Morgan can force any shareholder to withdraw their shares immediately, and the dividends they should receive will be determined by Morgan. Businesses opposed by shareholders cannot be operated. Shareholders are not allowed to speculate, except when using their own funds for gambling. Shareholders are also not allowed to engage in any other business. If Morgan passes away in the future, the partnership must be dissolved. However, if shareholders representing a majority notify Morgan's executor, declaring their willingness to extend the partnership for three years, the partnership may not be dissolved. The above is the content of the secret agreement. The names of the shareholders have not been announced, but a Senate committee member claimed that there are no secret shareholders. During the hearing this morning, Morgan Company shareholder Whitney and Pecora questioned each other, each defending their own positions. The point of contention was that the Morgan Company transferred certain securities at cost to favored customers when the market price was at its highest, without taking millions of dollars in profit. Morgan's lawyer, John Davis, later revealed that Morgan Company shareholders paid a total of 40 million dollars in income tax from 1917 to 1929. Today, Pecora stated that he still has a list of favored customers, which he will present. Before the hearing this morning, an amusing incident occurred. A news photographer, for the sake of a good story, brought in a female dwarf. The female dwarf then jumped onto Morgan's lap, causing laughter in the courtroom, and the photographer took pictures. Morgan was not offended, but the committee warned the photographer not to disclose the picture, otherwise they would not be allowed to attend future hearings.</p>

Also, at 1:30 PM, Tokonami visited advisor Mochizuki to inquire about the content of the meeting with Suzuki.</p>

The remaining 190 will take other civilian positions and will not be recalled for naval service unless it is an emergency. Today, when President Roosevelt personally presented the diplomas, he encouraged the graduates to break down the traditional social barriers in the naval community and with the so-called [professional class], saying that such habits are no longer in line with the times. He advised the graduates to adopt a new approach, to be united with the country and the entire nation, and to eliminate the view of taking cities by force.</p>

In response to questions from reporters, the US delegation stated that their hope for the economic conference was not for special treaties, but for broad agreements. They also hoped for a gentleman's agreement on the preservation of gold and the consistency of internal policies among major countries. The US delegation also mentioned the possibility of increased gold supply after central banks in various countries reduce reserve ratios and increase the use of silver.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Prelude to Debt Moratorium <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 1st reports that the Senate today discussed the war debt issue, focusing on practical aspects. Democratic Senator Tydings proposed paying off the war debt with a lump sum, saying that Britain only has 75 million US dollars worth of gold, and if the United States does not accept goods, how can Britain repay 40 billion in debt? Even the wisest people would be powerless. Democratic leader Robinson said that President Roosevelt is well aware of the difficulty of collecting debts owed to the United States, but based on various phenomena, the President is now implementing the congressional bill previously passed against the cancellation or modification of war debts to the best of his ability. At the same time, Democrat Rini stated in the House of Representatives that the proposed tax bill would give the President the power to conclude reciprocal tariff agreements, and that these agreements could be implemented once announced, without allowing the Senate to veto them. Rini's words can be seen as a prelude to the London war debt negotiations and possible moratorium measures.</p>

The teeth are carved from ivory and joined with gold brackets, hinges, and springs, representing a relic from before the profession of dentistry became specialized. Washington repeatedly mentioned his teeth in his diaries and correspondence. This material is helpful to historians, artists, and anecdote writers. Modern people often discuss Washington's mouth shape, which was strained by his false teeth, and there are various ridiculous legends about Washington's false teeth, all of which have been denied by historians studying this issue.</p>
<p>Progress of Ceasefire Agreement Signing (Reached)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Both Armies Have Been Ordered to Withdraw <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Acceptance of Military Zones Following Shanghai Method</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping reports that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement was formally signed at Tanggu yesterday (31st) at 11:10 AM. The Great Wall conflict, which had lasted for more than two months, has completely ended, and the peace movement, which had been running for many days, has declared its success. The details of the process and subsequent arrangements are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e86">Initial Contact <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese peace movement began with Yoshizawa's visit to China. Although there were several twists and turns, it gradually became concrete due to various efforts. All solutions were discussed in Shanghai before, and the opinions of both parties were quite close. Later, the situation in which the Japanese army threatened the situation in Tianjin deteriorated, and on the 22nd of last month, Japanese acting ambassador Nakayama was ordered to contact us to discuss four principles. The peace talks, which were on the verge of a stalemate, took a sharp turn for the better. Afterwards, both parties continued to proceed according to the four principles, and a solution was agreed upon in Miyun to implement a ceasefire. Then, formal representatives were sent to Tanggu to hold a formal meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e87">List of Representatives <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The list of representatives from both sides is as follows: The chief representative on the Chinese side was Lieutenant General Xiong Bin, chief advisor of the Military Branch; the staff included Major General Qian Zongze, advisor of the Military Branch; advisor Lei Shourong; Colonel Staff Officer Xu Yanmou (i.e., Xu Zuyi); councilors Yin Rugeng and Li Zeyi; and Colonel Zhang Xiguang, chief of staff of the First Army Corps.

The participating members included Staff Officer Major Ohashi Kumawo of the North China Garrison Army; Naval Attaché Lieutenant Sato Haru Kiyoichi of the Embassy; and Secretary Nakayama Shoichi of the Embassy.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Tanggu Meeting <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting location and representatives were determined, representatives from both sides gathered in Tanggu on May 30. The Chinese representatives departed from Beiping by special train at 7:55 AM that morning, with extremely strict security along the way. They paused briefly when passing through Tianjin to meet with Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese Tianjin Garrison. They arrived in Tanggu at 2:40 PM in the afternoon. The Japanese representatives, including Okamura, arrived on a Japanese warship on the evening of the 29th, while staff members such as Nakayama traveled on the special train with our representatives on the 30th. The Chinese representatives stayed at the Yongli Alkali Plant and on the special train, while the Japanese representatives stayed in the Japanese barracks and the Osaka Shosen Company. Tanggu Station was heavily guarded, and the city was also under special security. A curfew was imposed at 8:00 PM. The Chinese representatives went to the Jiuda Fine Salt Company for lunch at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and the Japanese representatives were also invited to the banquet. At around 4:00 PM, representatives and all personnel from both China and Japan went to the Osaka Shosen Company to hold the first meeting. They first met each other for ordinary socializing and then immediately convened a meeting that lasted for four hours. All issues were completely agreed upon, and it was decided that the Japanese side would draft the articles of agreement for further discussion the next day. At 9:00 AM on the 31st, the second meeting was held again at the Osaka Shosen Company. First, Japanese representative Okamura presented the terms of the armistice agreement to our representatives, including Xiong Bin, for inspection. After inspecting, our representatives retreated to another room in the conference hall to discuss the terms of the agreement in detail and made slight revisions. They then re-entered the conference hall at 11:00 AM to meet with the Japanese representatives. The Japanese side accepted all the revisions proposed by our side.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Representatives Sign <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>At 11:10 AM, the completed original was written in both Chinese and Japanese, two copies each, and signed by the chief representatives of both sides. The armistice agreement that all parties were watching was thus established. In this meeting, all important issues had been discussed in advance, so no major disputes arose from the beginning of the meeting to the signing, and it was announced to be established in the shortest period of time and in the most favorable circumstances. After the agreement was signed, representatives from both sides held a diplomatic toast ceremony and dispersed. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese representatives invited our representatives to an informal discussion, in which they discussed the handling of the rebel army and the security of the demilitarized zone. They dispersed at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Full Text of the Agreement <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Only five articles of the agreement signed by both parties have been made public by both sides. The rest and the appendices are kept secret. The five articles of the agreement that have been published are as follows: (1) The Chinese army shall withdraw to the area west and south of the line connecting Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Lintingzhen, Ninghe, and Lutai and shall not advance further or engage in any provocative or disruptive actions. (2) The Japanese army may use aircraft or other means to conduct inspections in order to ensure the implementation of the first item. The Chinese side shall provide protection and facilitation. (3) The Japanese army confirms that when the Chinese army has withdrawn to the line agreed upon in the first item, it will not cross the line and continue to pursue, and will automatically return to the line of the Great Wall. (4) The maintenance of security in the area south of the Great Wall line and north and east of the line agreed upon in the first item shall be the responsibility of the Chinese police. (5) This agreement shall take effect immediately after signing.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Demilitarized Zone <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>This agreement is tantamount to an agreement under duress, which cannot be denied. The scope of the demilitarized zone is extremely wide, stretching from Shanhaiguan in the east to Yanqing in the Chahar territory in the west, and as far south as the vicinity of Beiping and Tianjin. The places listed in the agreement, Yanqing is outside the Great Wall, belongs to Chahar, and is about 200 li northwest of Beiping; Changping is 75 li northwest of Beiping, and the PingSui Railway passes through it; Gaoliying is 45 li north of Beiping; Shunyi is 70 li northeast of Beiping; Tongzhou is 45 li east of Beiping; Xianghe is more than 100 li southeast of Beiping, 60 li from Tongzhou; Baodi is 170 li southeast of Beiping, 60 li from Xianghe; Lintingzhen is 50 li southeast of Baodi; Ninghe is 300 li southeast of Beiping; Lutai is more than 100 li east of Tianjin, through which the BeiNing Railway passes, and is 57 li west of Tanggu. From the above, the closest point of the demilitarized zone is only 30 to 40 li away from Beiping. Although the police administration in the zone nominally belongs entirely to our country, the army cannot cross the line a step, and the loss of sovereignty is self-evident. The scope of the Great Wall line was originally very broad, but in the agreement, the range west of Yanqing is marked with numbers, subtly defining the scope of the Great Wall line. The wording is quite clever and must have taken a lot of consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Implementation by Both Sides <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The agreement took effect after signing. After signing yesterday, representatives from both sides reported to their respective authorities. Starting today (1st), both sides will comply with the agreement and begin implementation simultaneously. Our army will begin to return to Jianchang, and some troops will be transferred to bandit areas to suppress bandits. The remaining troops will be assigned to other defense areas and gradually relocated. The Japanese army will also begin withdrawing from the Great Wall line today.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Acceptance Methods <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The area currently occupied by the Japanese army will become a demilitarized zone after the withdrawal of troops, and personnel will be dispatched by the Chinese side in the future. Local security will be maintained by the police. All acceptance methods will be carried out in accordance with the Shanghai and Qingdao methods, or a committee will be organized to handle everything. The police in the demilitarized zone will be similar to those in Songhu and will be organized into special police. The number of people will be determined according to the local situation and there will be no restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Handling of the Rebel Army <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied various places in Guannei, the rebel army led by Li Jichun and others was very active. Shi Yousan even openly recruited soldiers in Qinhuangdao. Resolving this matter is particularly difficult. The Japanese side claims on the surface that it is voluntary and has nothing to do with their imperial army, and that they cannot take active actions. At the same time, our army is limited by the agreement and cannot use force to suppress them. How to resolve this is a major problem. Representatives from China and Japan mentioned it yesterday, and the Japanese side verbally stated that they would wait for both parties to find a way to handle it in Ping in the future. The Japanese side's temporary goal is only to secure the Great Wall line. It is also possible that the rebel army will be resolved smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Representatives Return to Ping <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>After the representatives from both sides completed the signing, they left Tanggu separately to report back to their respective authorities. The Chinese representatives, including Xiong Bin, arrived in Ping by special train at 11:30 PM last night. After getting off the train, they went to Jurentang to meet with He and Huang to report on the progress and to consult on various issues after the signing. They dispersed this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Military Conference <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Because of the signing of the agreement, He Yingqin specially convened a temporary military conference at Jurentang at 11:00 AM this morning, attended by more than 20 generals including Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Lu Bingxun, Wan Fulin, Xu Tingyao, and Xiao Zhichu. In addition to He Yingqin, Huang Fu and Xiong Bin also attended. In addition to reporting on the progress of the signing of the agreement, there were detailed discussions on issues such as the withdrawal of troops and defense zones. They dispersed until around 1:00 PM in the afternoon (June 1st).</p>
<p>Jilin National Salvation Army</p>
<h3 id="e97">Tian Lin's Troops Capture Fuxin and Kangping <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Members of the Faku County Militia Join</p>
<p>Tian's Representative Asks He Yingqin for Instructions</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping reports that after Jehol fell for a long time and Fuxin and Kangping were occupied by the Japanese army, Tian Lin, the commander of the Second Route Army of the Jilin National Salvation Army, recently broke through Fuxin and Kangping again. Tian Yingqiu, a representative of Tian's forces, came to Ping to meet with He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Military Branch, to ask for instructions. Our reporter specifically visited Mr. Tian to inquire about the process of breaking through Fuxin and Kangping. The account is as follows: Tian Lin, commander of the Second Route Army of the Jilin National Salvation Army, and Deputy Commander Yu Ruoyu, led more than 3,000 troops in February, departing from the Jiangjiapi Gulch base in Huadian County, Jilin, intending to go to the border of Jehol to request military supplies from the authorities and resist Japan for a long time. After more than a month of fighting, they arrived at the border of Jehol on April 1. Unexpectedly, Jehol fell, and the passes of the Great Wall fell one after another. The isolated army was in a desperate situation, surrounded on all sides. In this desperate situation, the only way to survive was to fight to the death. They joined forces with the volunteer army of the Liaoning Incident led by Jia Bingyi and Wang Hanpeng, and conquered Fuxin on April 5, killing many enemies and seizing more than 100 guns and more than 50,000 rounds of ammunition, and two cannon mortars. Later, after several westward advances, they were unable to defend the heavy siege and had to return east. On April 25, they arrived at Yangjiagou in Faku County, where the head of the local militia, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, led more than 1,200 cavalry to join them. On May 1, they joined forces with Jia Bingyi's 2,000 troops to besiege Kangping. After a fierce battle of five hours, the city fell. The Japanese councilor Shimada and instructor Hirata in the county office were shot and killed, and a pseudo-county chief named Liu was captured. They seized a mortar, more than 200 rifles, and the military prestige was greatly shaken. The Japanese side was frightened and began to mobilize more than 400 Japanese garrison troops and more than 100 pseudo-security forces from Changtu, Tieling, and Kaiyuan, approaching the Tian'e River and Wujianfang area under Kangping County, falling into the ambush of our army. After a full day of fierce fighting, in addition to eight escaped Japanese soldiers and 32 pseudo-soldiers, all the rest were annihilated. They seized more than 500 rifles, six steel cannons, six heavy machine guns, four light machine guns, more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition, and more than a dozen vehicles of supplies. After this battle, the military prestige became even more impressive, and more than 300 more people came from all directions. Currently, more than 4,000 people are gathered, occupying strategic areas in Kangping, Faku, and Zhangwu counties, rectifying the army and waiting for the opportunity to fight to the death with the enemy. The person was sent to Ping to negotiate and ask the Military Branch and the National Salvation Association for orders. (May 30)</p>

<p>Beijing News, in order to develop the coal industry, increase production, and facilitate transportation, the Ministry of Industry borrowed 1,000 locomotives and freight cars from the BeiNing Railway, and planned to borrow money from Jin Cheng and other banks to repair them. The conference convened coal merchants and railway representatives to Beijing to hold a coal transportation conference to discuss the entire plan. The opening ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Industry at 9:00 AM on the 1st. The meeting continued in the afternoon, and nine measures for repairing locomotives and vehicles were passed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e100">Attendance <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>

<p>At the opening ceremony at 9:00 AM, Baochang Chen Gongbo presided, and Wang Zhong recorded. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, Mr. Chen gave an opening speech, the gist of which was that in recent years, China's coal mines have been affected by the dumping of cheap foreign coal, which has led to a slump. It is not enough to make up for it without overall planning, so this ministry has convened this meeting. I am very pleased and honored that you have traveled from afar to attend the meeting. The main purpose of this meeting is to (1) find ways to organize coal transportation vehicles to facilitate transportation, so as to avoid the stagnation of coal; (2) plan to borrow money from banks to pay for vehicle repair costs. If this loan is successful, it will be of great help to the economic adjustment of the coal industry in the future. I hope that everyone will express their opinions as much as possible, exchange ideas with each other, and make corresponding decisions to maintain the coal industry. After Mr. Chen finished speaking, he left to attend the Central Standing Committee and was replaced by Huang Jintao, director of the Mining Department, who presided over the meeting and began the discussion until it adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Passed Proposals <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>At 2 PM, the formal meeting continued, still chaired by Huang Jintao. Discussions lasted until 5:45 PM before adjournment. Nine principles for the repair of locomotives and rolling stock were passed on the spot. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Railway Bureau is responsible for repairing the locomotives (with missing characters) rolling stock (with missing characters) 50 trains (each with 500 tons) to good working order, specifically for transporting coal for export by mining companies.</p>
<p>Article 2: The repair cost for each locomotive is approximately 30,000 yuan, and each carriage is approximately 10,000 yuan, totaling approximately 2 million yuan. This requires guarantees from both the Railway Bureau and the mining companies. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will borrow from the bank on their behalf. All withdrawals of this loan must be signed by representatives of both the Railway Bureau and the mining companies.</p>
<p>Article 3: Regarding this matter, the Railway Bureau and the mining companies must jointly organize an entity to be responsible for the handling.</p>
<p>Article 4: The repayment of this loan shall be made by the Railway Bureau by allocating half of the freight revenue from the coal transported by these vehicles to the bank until the principal and interest are fully repaid.</p>
<p>Article 5: The locomotives and rolling stock specified in Article 1 must be repaired and inspected within six to ten months. After acceptance, they will be specifically used for coal transportation. Thereafter, all ordinary and accidental repair costs for the vehicles shall be borne entirely by the Railway Bureau. During this repair period, the Railway Bureau should allocate other vehicles for supplementation.</p>
<p>Article 6: The ownership and custody of these locomotives and rolling stock shall remain with the Railway Bureau, but the power of disposition shall belong to the entity jointly formed by the Railway Bureau and the mining companies.</p>
<p>Article 7: Whether the coal is transported to Qingdao, Tianjin, Hankou, or Pukou, and from which mine it originates, the (missing characters) tonnage that each train should transport shall not be exceeded and should be determined by the entity jointly formed by the Railway Bureau and the mining companies. If the coal is transported along the railway lines, this tonnage shall also be the limit. However, in the event of special circumstances such as traffic obstruction, where vehicles cannot directly reach Qingdao, Dagu, Hankou, or Pukou, and the mining companies are forced to use these trains along the line, two tons can be calculated as one ton of exported coal.</p>
<p>Article 8: All freight charges and taxes payable on these coal cars shall be levied in accordance with regulations. If these railway vehicles operate on other railways, the freight charges shall be allocated to them accordingly.</p>
<p>Article 9: All railway regulations that must be followed during the coal transportation period, as well as the use of returning empty cars, etc., shall be the responsibility of the Railway Bureau's Traffic Department, but shall not interfere with coal transportation. (Riri News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Rebellion of Troops in Western Hunan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Chen Wo Agitates Various Units in Western Hunan for Rebellion</p>
<p>Occupies Qianyang, Zhijiang, and Huangxian Counties</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Chen Wo, the brigade commander of the former 62nd Division, commanded by Tao Guang, was a hero of the Green Forest in Western Hunan. He was stationed in Hengzhou the previous year and was instigated to plot something. When Commander Tao discovered this, Chen immediately fled. His troops were led back to their old nest in Zhijiang and Huangxian in Western Hunan by He Jingcheng and Chen Changyou, where they resumed their bandit lifestyle. Last year, He Jian sent personnel to incorporate them, and they were reorganized into two regiments. He was appointed as the commander of the 1st Regiment for Suppressing Bandits in Hunan, and Chen (Changyou) was appointed as the commander of the 2nd Regiment for Suppressing Bandits in Western Hunan, stationed in the seven counties of the upper reaches of Western Hunan, responsible for suppression. There has been peace in recent years.</p>
<p>In early May, the provincial government decided to divide the province into six districts, with two provincial committee members assigned to each district to inspect county administration and reduce surcharges. The seven counties in the upper reaches of Western Hunan were inspected by Li Jue, the commander of the 10th Division, and Huang Jiasheng, commissioned by the provincial government. On the 24th, Li and Huang led six staff members and arrived at Zhijiang County. The garrison was Chen Changyou’s regiment. Unexpectedly, Chen Wo, the former brigade commander of the 62nd Division who had been on the run, had returned to Hunan from Beijing and colluded with various units in Western Hunan and local bandits to plot rebellion, intending to capture and kill Commander Li and Committee Member Huang in Zhijiang, and then start an uprising and plot misconduct.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Chen Changyou and Chen Wo were originally cousins. All the soldiers in the regiment were former subordinates of Chen Wo, so they had long been agitated by Chen Wo and decided to make a move during a banquet to welcome Commander Li. However, Chen Changyou, understanding the greater good, refused to endorse it. However, his troops had all been won over by Wo and could not be stopped, so he informed Commander Li Jue and advised him to flee quickly.</p>
<p>At that time, Commander Li and Committee Member Huang were holding a meeting in the Zhijiang County government office to discuss reducing land taxes. Upon receiving the report, they immediately excused themselves and left the meeting, disguised themselves, and fled the city, abandoning all their luggage. The staff members also scattered and fled. Only a little more than ten miles outside the city, Chen Wo had already received the report and sent troops to pursue them. Just as they were in a critical situation, Chen Changyou also arrived, intercepted the pursuing troops, and told Commander Li et al. that Chen Wo’s troops were already stationed in Qianyang County, and they must bypass Qianyang overnight and flee back to Hongjiang to escape danger. After speaking, Chen Changyou led the pursuing troops back to Zhijiang and reported to Chen Wo that he had failed to capture them.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Chen Wo had already realized that Chen Changyou had secretly informed Li and let them go afterwards, so he immediately shot Chen Changyou to death with a barrage of gunfire, and then occupied Zhijiang County, proclaiming himself the Commander of the Hunan Anti-Japanese Bandit Suppression Army. The units of He Jingcheng, Yao Jiyu, etc., stationed in the upper reaches of Western Hunan, rose up in response, and have now occupied Qianyang, Zhijiang, and Huangxian counties. The Qian Army's Che Mingyi Division is also cooperating, and their momentum is enormous. Commander Li, Committee Member Huang, Zhijiang County Magistrate Wen Yizhi, Qianyang County Magistrate Chen Jishi, and Huangxian County Magistrate Tan Ming have all fled to Hongjiang one after another, fortunately escaping danger. Li and Huang rushed back to the provincial capital on the 26th to report the mutiny to He Jian.</p>
<p>It is reported that Chen Wo also plans to lead troops to attack Hongjiang. The counties in the upper reaches of Western Hunan are in a state of chaos because the province has no garrison and the troops have mostly been persuaded by Chen Wo. He Jian, due to traffic congestion and being unable to reach them, has no concrete measures to take for the time being, but has telegraphed Wang Jialie, the chairman of Guizhou Province, to discuss joint suppression measures, and will decide on a suppression plan after receiving a reply. As for Regiment Commander Chen Changyou, who refused to join the rebellion and was brutally killed, a request will be submitted to the central government for preferential treatment to comfort his loyal spirit.

<p>The highest commander of the Japanese Navy stationed in Hankou is Banno Tsuneshige, the commander of the 1st Overseas Dispatch Fleet, who has now been ordered to be transferred to the commander of the 7th Squadron. All naval forces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will be replaced by Vice Admiral Minnei, the commander of the 3rd Overseas Dispatch Fleet. Minnei telegraphed the Japanese consulate on the 30th, saying that he would arrive in Hankou on the flagship "Izumo" within a few days. Banno will go to Shanghai after Minnei arrives.</p>
<p>At the time when a large number of Japanese ships are gathering in Hankou and the new and old naval authorities are rotating, Japanese merchant ships have also become active. They were originally divided into six routes in the Yangtze River: one is the Shanghai-Hankou route, with the "Zuiyo," "Daisada," "Daifuku," "Dairi," "Yueyang," "Fengyang," "Luoyang," "Nanyang," and "Xiangyang" nine ships; the second is the Hankou-Yichang route, with the "Xinyang," "Daiho," and "Tangyang" three ships; the third is the Hankou-Changde route, with the "Xiangjiang" one ship; the fourth is the Hankou-Xiangtan route, with the "Wuling" and "Yuanjiang" two ships; the fifth is the Shanghai-Yichang route, with the "Daikichi" one ship; and the sixth is the Yichang-Chongqing route, with the "Changyang," "Jialing," "Fuling," "Yiyang," and "Chongyang" five ships.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the business of Japanese ships was greatly reduced. Five of the six routes were suspended. Only four ships, including the "Xiangyang" on the Shanghai-Hankou route, were operating. In the past two months, Japanese goods have gradually been transported westward, mostly carried by Japanese ships. Japanese shipping companies are trying to take the opportunity to resume operations in order to restore the original position of the Yangtze River route. After consultation among various companies, it was decided that from June 1st, all six Yangtze River routes would resume operations, and all passenger ticket fares would be specially reduced. Passenger tickets from Shanghai to Hankou were originally six yuan and fifty cents, but now they have been reduced to three yuan, and freight charges have been reduced to 70% to attract customers.

<p>Fei Kunjiang's rice mill outside the South Gate near Daqian Bridge employed several workers from Jiangbei, including Chen Zhongchao, Ji Jinghua, and Bian Hongkui. They often gambled in their spare time. On April 25th, Chen demanded gambling debts from Ji, Bian, etc., and they quarreled and fought each other. As a result, Chen Zhongchao fell ill the next day and died on May 1st. The factory owner bought a coffin and prepared the body. Liu Jingshou, a fellow villager, told his younger brother Chen Zhongjie that his brother had died from injuries, and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the court prosecutor's office.</p>
<p>This morning (2nd), relevant witnesses were summoned for interrogation. According to Liu Jingshou's statement, he only saw a scratch mark behind the deceased's ear, and nothing else. The factory owner said that he had hired a doctor to treat the illness, and had a prescription as proof, and it was not caused by assault. Ji Jinghua denied the assault. The prosecutor then instructed factory owner Fei Kunjiang and the deceased's younger brother Chen Zhongjie to be released. Liu Jingshou and Ji Jinghua were released on bail, and it was decided that the prosecutor would personally go to the countryside on the morning of the 3rd to open the coffin for an autopsy to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Exchange has connected seven pairs of rural telephone lines with the Wuxi Telephone Company. Last year, it continued to connect with provincial long-distance telephone lines and installed long-distance and rural terminal gateways mechanically. Recently, the Wuxi Telephone Company learned that the exchange operators had embezzled handling fees and were negligent in management. They immediately submitted evidence and accused the operators of being frivolous and immoral to the Construction Department. The Construction Department, based on the report, immediately sent Li Zhen, a technician from the department, to Wuxi to investigate and secretly collect evidence from various agencies.</p>

<p>As new indigo is now on the market and the rural economy is slightly recovering, the bandit atmosphere in urban and rural areas is rampant again. Yesterday, two cases of land and water robbery occurred. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A ship traveling between Wuxi and Caoqiao in Yixing was loaded with goods from Caoqiao to Wuxi yesterday. When passing the Kaiyuan Shaotang camp area, three robbers suddenly emerged from the cabin pretending to be passengers, took out pistols, and threatened them not to make a sound. Then they searched the entire ship, and after an hour, they took the loot and landed.</p>
<p>(2) At the home of Zhou Heqing, a farmer in Furong Mountain, the 6th district of the county, more than ten robbers suddenly came yesterday morning, broke into the house, and robbed them of silver dollars, clothing, leather bags, etc., causing huge losses. They also injured Zhou Heqing with a stick, and Zhou Heqing fainted to the ground. His two sons, Bu Gen and Shou Zuoyou, resisted, and the robbers shot Bu Gen in the chest and Gen Shou in both feet. They were rushed to the city for treatment at Puren Hospital. Bu Gen was seriously injured in the heart and was bleeding heavily, and his life may be in danger.</p>
<p>Both cases have been reported to the county for arrest.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Fish and Dried Fish Industry Opposes Fisheries Construction Fee <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce recently received letters from the Fresh and Dried Goods Industry Association of Jiaxing and eight other counties, and the Ham and Salted Fish and Dried Fish Industry Association of Hangzhou City, stating that it was difficult to pay the fisheries construction fee within the specified time and that the public was anxious, requesting that they make efforts to argue for them. After discussion at the meeting, it was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Industry for cancellation, and to inform fish and dried fish merchants in various places to temporarily suspend collecting on their behalf before the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Hangzhou City Fish and Dried Fish Industry actively opposed this fisheries construction fee and issued an express mail telegram the other day, which stated: "All city, county, and town chambers of commerce, fish and dried fish industry associations, fisheries organizations, and fishery merchant associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are aware that since the sudden establishment of the Fisheries Construction Committee of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region and the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Shaoxing branch office, notices have been posted everywhere and inland tax collectors have been dispatched to verify and collect taxes, arbitrarily harassing merchants and people. This association speculates that the intention is nothing more than for unscrupulous people to use this as a pretext to collect money from the people under the guise of public opinion. As the name implies, it is to take from the fishermen and use for the fishermen, and it is acceptable to collect fees from fishermen and fishing households, but it is completely irrelevant to traders and merchants. Now the branch office is acting perversely and using coercive measures to force our merchants to pay, which is akin to the revival of likin. This association has discussed and cannot approve it. In addition to publishing a statement of denial in the newspaper, we have jointly petitioned various party and government agencies and have been accepted and understood, and have been allowed to forward the request to the central government for cancellation. All member firms and shops have been notified. Before the government explicitly orders compliance, any fees, whether collected or collected on behalf, will be denied. This matter is related to vital interests, and it is hoped that your organization will make the same appeal and help our industry. Thank you very much."</p>

Furthermore, the County Education Fund Audit Committee discovered that the Education Bureau's accounts had overstated expenditures and that the cash was stored outside the safe by the accountant. The committee members immediately asked the County Government for instructions, and it was reported that the county would temporarily seal the accounts and cash together, pending the arrival of the director and accountant in the city to unseal them.</p>

<p>On May 28th, the road workers on the Jia-Ping Highway's East Gate section used weapons to beat the water and land patrol officers, causing the East Gate shops to close in unison. Subsequently, the County Public Security Bureau dispatched a car patrol team and a patrol brigade to arrest ten workers, including Yan Zhiwen, who caused the trouble, and the situation was calmed. The case has now been transferred to the court, which has scheduled a hearing on the 5th of this month to summon the two patrol officers, He Xiang, who were beaten, and Sun Xinsheng, a local notable, to testify, so as to investigate.</p>
<p>Before the case was concluded, a dozen road workers from the same section gathered at Shu Temple one morning, extorting money from the abbot monk Fuquan and beating him severely with weapons, causing Fuquan to be seriously injured. When the patrol brigade received the news and went to the scene, the road workers had dispersed. After accompanying the monk to the workers' location for identification, Hong Daxing, Zhang Xiaoxiang, Xie Chaohe, and others were identified as the extortionists at the scene. They were taken to the bureau together with the foreman Wang Zhenghe for disposition.</p>

<p>The police officer reported the incident to Liao Chuliang, the director of the First Public Security Sub-Bureau, who rushed to the scene for investigation, but found no traces. According to Yi Yiyun, the silver room officer of the shop, at around 5:00 a.m., a robber wearing a felt hat and a black jacket suddenly entered the silver room with a gun, threatening them not to make a sound and forcing them to hand over the key to the iron cabinet. He opened the cabinet and took 200 silver dollars, 755 yuan and 8 jiao in banknotes, and 3 yuan and 6 jiao in small coins, then took off the felt hat and jacket, and left calmly.</p>

<p>Baima Town in the 4th district of the county was suddenly attacked by twenty or thirty bandits speaking with a Yancheng-Funing accent at around 8:00 p.m. the other night. They were armed with long and short guns and searched house by house, sparing no one in the town. Before leaving, they also took away the耕牛 of Zhao Xuekui, a villager, and ordered him to prepare 100 yuan to redeem it in Wuying Town in the 5th district. The bandits escaped with their loot until dawn the next morning. The losses are said to be huge.</p>

<p>Li Zufan, the commander of the 10th district of the county, and Tan Shuren, the chief of the police substation stationed in Linze Town, went to various villages for patrol the other day.

<p>All counties and cities in Anhui Province are actively proceeding with the Central Government's convocation of a provisional national congress, and the initial elections have now begun. Wuhu is located in a strategic location with a large population, making it the premier district in Anhui Province. The initial election is therefore of greater importance than others, and it is also attracting attention from candidates.</p>
<p>Since the Wuhu Party Headquarters was ordered to suspend all committee members, only Liu Yiqing, the clerk, and Tong Daosheng, the secretary, were responsible for handling all party affairs. The initial election for the provisional congress was originally scheduled to be held on the 28th of last month at the Private Secondary Business School of the Chamber of Commerce. After Liu and others made preparations, Zhang Xiugao was specially sent by the province to Wuhu to supervise the election. Candidates lobbied and made every effort in advance.</p>
<p>When voting began on the morning of that day, Wang Zuhua declared that he had discovered that a Li Mou was impersonating the party member Hu Wencheng to vote at the scene. Party members have their own party membership card with a photo as proof, but those in charge did not pay attention to this, indicating that there was obvious cheating. As a result, the ballot box was destroyed and the ballots cast were also torn up. At the same time, there was shouting, beatings, and a general uproar. Several people were injured, and several others were chased, caught, and sent to the Public Security Bureau, but they were all released shortly afterward. The meeting broke up in a panic.</p>
<p>The circumstances were reported to the higher authorities for verification and instructions. Liu Yiqing, the clerk in charge of the Wuhu Party Headquarters, stated that since being ordered to handle the election, he had tried his best to accommodate the requests of all candidates as long as they were within the scope of the law. Unexpectedly, this unfortunate incident occurred, and the ballot box was destroyed, making it impossible to continue the election. He has now jointly submitted a request to the higher party headquarters for instructions and resolution with the provincial election supervisor. Before receiving a reply, the election will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>It is also reported that similar disputes occurred in the initial elections for the provisional congress in Dangtu and Nanling counties.</p>

<p>The Cocoon Industry Association held a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday (1st) at 2:00 p.m. 26 cocoon merchants registered (there are a total of 47 cocoon merchants in the county, and about 30 registered this year). Miao Shaoqing was elected as the chairman. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) The market will open today (2nd). Latecomers will have to make do.</p>
<p>(2) The price of cocoons is 40 yuan per dan for improved varieties and 30 yuan per dan for local varieties. Those who cheat on weighing scales or manipulate prices will have their business licenses revoked.</p>
<p>(3) All surcharges: The government has already canceled all kinds of extortionate taxes and levies last year, so they will be ignored. The public office donation is 0.3 yuan per dan of dried cocoons.</p>
<p>(4) Business tax: The provincial government sympathizes with the cocoon merchants and levies 0.2%. The public office will collect it together with the tax bureau.</p>
<p>(5) Stamp tax: It will be handled according to the established case and recognized as 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) It is too late to rush and install the new system. It must be done next year. For now, we should follow the example of Wuxi and other neighboring counties.</p>
<p>Next, the election of the executive and supervisory committee members of the Cocoon Industry Association, who have long been in office, and the liquidation of the association's accounts were discussed.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Memorial Declaration of June 3rd <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association, taking this day as the 94th anniversary of Commissioner Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen, has received reports from anti-narcotics associations across the country, all preparing to hold enthusiastic commemorations, and hereby issues the following declaration:</p>
<p>Memorial Declaration of the 94th June 3rd Anniversary: Ninety-four years have passed since Commissioner Lin Zexu burned opium at Humen. During these nearly one hundred years, the enforcement of prohibition has weakened, deteriorating with each passing day. The tide of narcotics and the scourge of opium have continued to grow and increase. If Commissioner Lin were to rise from the grave, one wonders how heartbroken he would be, perhaps uttering a lament about the mainland sinking into utter ruin. Let us take a general look at the scourge of opium over the past year. Who would not feel a sense of national despair and a nation on the brink of destruction? In provinces along the Yangtze River, opium has openly become a public commodity, implemented despite opposition. Along the Yangtze River, steamboats transporting opium have become commonplace, and the practice is escalating, defying prevention. In Yichang, Chongqing, and provinces like Henan and Hebei, illicit drug manufacturing facilities are rampant, with authorities turning a blind eye, and passersby casting sidelong glances. The poison of red pills spreads throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River, like a flood, with few escaping its reach. As for the Chairman of Rehe, he abandons the province to protect opium cultivation, and officials entering and exiting North China cannot do so without undergoing thorough searches. This represents a complete absence of discipline, bringing shame upon the international community. Commissioner Lin Zexu, ninety-four years ago, already lamented the proliferation of evils in his era, causing him great sorrow. However, he surely never imagined that the strange phenomena of today would reach such an extent. What is somewhat encouraging is that the prohibition policies of Shandong and Zhejiang have not yet gone astray, and the Fujian authorities have already taken measures to eradicate opium seedlings. However, the scourge of drug pills in Zhejiang Province remains severe in secret, and many residents of Fujian Province openly engage in the opium trade. Whether opium prohibition will succeed still depends on the authorities' unwavering determination and effective measures to make a definitive judgment. Our association upholds Commissioner Lin Zexu's spirit of eradicating narcotics thoroughly, and follows the late Premier's instruction to never compromise. It is our duty to move forward bravely. As long as there is breath in us, our resolve will not waver. Even in today's circumstances, amidst thorns and surrounded by demons, when the anti-narcotics movement is restricted and freedom of speech and propaganda is suppressed, we are determined to sacrifice and persevere, vowing to unite the strength of the people to eradicate the source of narcotics. We dare to declare to our compatriots that even during this period of national crisis, we must not forget the importance of anti-narcotics efforts. Although enemy guns and bombs can inflict damage, they are not as terrifying as the chronic destruction caused by narcotics. Armed aggression can still be resisted, but the devastation wrought by narcotics leaves no possibility of escape. It is our hope that compatriots throughout the country will no longer disregard the fact that anti-narcotics efforts are essential to saving the nation, and that saving the nation must begin with anti-narcotics efforts. Let us work together to achieve the goal of cleansing and stabilizing the nation, so that we may comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven and not fail the meaning of this day of commemoration. The Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association, with this declaration.</p>

<p>Investor Association Urges Sino-British Corporation</p>
<p>To Lodge a Serious Inquiry with the Chinese Government</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Investor Association held a meeting on Thursday at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd. at No. 2 Guangdong Road. Mr. Retinil was elected as chairman, followed by the election of Mr. Retinil, Mr. Haygate, and Mr. Morgan to the executive committee, who will visit Mr. Pusubique, the Shanghai representative of the Sino-British Corporation, to seek ways to protect the interests of the road's investors. Before the election of the executive committee, the temporary honorary secretary, Mr. Gu Pei, stated the opinions of several bondholders, saying that they wished to consolidate the strength of the Sino-British Corporation and draw public attention to the road's operations and shortfalls. The principal and interest of the bonds issued during the construction of the road are unconditionally guaranteed by the Chinese government and secured by the entire property of the road. Now, the semi-annual bond interest has been unpaid for three periods, and the net profit bonds have not been paid a penny since 1929. Therefore, it is now appropriate to ask the Sino-British Corporation, as the custodian of the bondholders, to lodge a serious inquiry with the Chinese government and request the fulfillment of its obligations. Subsequently, Mr. Anderson described the initial operation of the road, stating that the road could have been profitable, but due to interference from the military and waste by the Railway Bureau, it has not been able to achieve profitability. Chinese pledges are not worth the paper they are written on and are now worthless.</p>

With the brutal Japanese invasion and the impending loss of our nation, every person with blood in their veins feels pain. As a soldier, I have an inescapable duty to resist Japan and save the country. I am deeply grateful for your earnest encouragement and generous financial assistance, which has warmed the hearts of the three armies and strengthened the soldiers' shared hatred of the enemy. They are elated, inspired, and will bravely advance to sweep away the enemy forces to repay your kindness. Sincerely, Fang Zhenwu, respectfully.</p>
<p>After the Naming of the "Shanghai City" Aircraft</p>
<p>A Telegram from the Aviation Association</p>
<p>Hoping for Enthusiastic Participation from All Sectors</p>
<p>The Aviation Association sends a telegram: To all newspaper offices: Air force is the main force in modern warfare and the center of national defense planning. All countries are striving to strengthen and promote it in various ways. Our country's military is backward, national defense is weak, and the air force is even more infantile. As a result, the Northeast was seized, and the borders were destroyed. Recently, enemy spies have infiltrated, and Hebei is in imminent danger. The lives of the nation's people are hanging by a thread. Leaders from all sectors of the city and citizens throughout the city, out of pain and anger, and eager to help, are anxious to save the nation. Therefore, the Chinese Aviation Association was organized, and it actively seeks members and raises large sums of money, in order to gather popular strength, assist the government, expand the air force, build air defense, and proceed with operations. Thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the citizens and their active donations, it has achieved results, reaching over one million, and has ordered eighteen warplanes. Now, the first one (named the "Shanghai City Government") has already arrived. On June 1st, at 2 p.m., a naming ceremony will be held at the Jiangwan Racecourse, along with a public performance. All my compatriots, aware of the impending crisis and the coming of air disasters, should be united in resisting aggression and seeking survival. Understand that there is sympathy for this. All sectors should strive to rise up, enthusiastically join the Chinese Aviation Association, and work hard to donate to the Aviation Salvation Fund, and jointly undertake the great cause of Aviation Salvation. The survival of the nation is deeply dependent on this. Time is fleeting; let us rise up and come together. In anticipation, we are most excited. The Chinese Aviation Association respectfully.

<p>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to Meet Today</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Day After Tomorrow's General Meeting <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) returned to state operation, it plans to expand its shipping business and intends to borrow 360,000 (rumors say 400,000, which is inaccurate) gold pounds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to purchase six coastal and Yangtze River ships. This has been approved by the Central Political Council. The Boxer Indemnity Committee is scheduled to convene a Finance Committee meeting today at 4 p.m. and a board meeting the day after tomorrow to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Proposed Loan <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The board of directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to borrow funds from the Boxer Indemnity to expand its shipping business. Executive directors Zhang Shouyong and Liu Hongsheng, along with Minister of Communications Zhu Jia骅, negotiated with Zhu Jia骅, Wang Jingwei, Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, Chen Guofu, Zhang Daofan, and others, who jointly proposed to the Central Political Council to borrow 360,000 gold pounds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to purchase six coastal and Yangtze River ships. This has been approved by the Central Political Council. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has submitted a detailed plan to the Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors.</p>
<h3 id="e128">One of the Boxer Indemnity Funds <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The British-returned Boxer Indemnity funds, deposited in London, amount to approximately 2 million gold pounds, with an annual interest rate of 2%. The distribution criteria are two-thirds for railways and one-third for water conservancy. The stipulation is that goods or materials must be purchased from Britain, and no cash can be received. As for water conservancy projects, there is no need to purchase materials from Britain. Therefore, 800,000 gold pounds under the name of water conservancy cannot be used. It must be re-loaned to domestic enterprises that need British materials in order to be converted into cash. It is appropriate to re-loan it to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to purchase new ships, and the company will repay the cash in the future, which can then be used for water conservancy projects.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Revenue Guarantee <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company re-loans the Boxer Indemnity funds, the water conservancy portion of the funds, excluding the Huai River diversion project, 360,000 pounds, calculated at 16 Chinese currency yuan per pound, totaling 5.76 million Chinese currency yuan, with a weekly interest rate of 5%. The revenue from the six newly purchased coastal and Yangtze River ships will be used as collateral. Once approved by today's Boxer Indemnity Committee meeting, it can be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Six New Ships <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Borrowing the Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase four coastal ships, including three of 3,500 tons each and one of 3,000 tons, and two Yangtze River ships of 3,500 tons each. In the future, the coastal ships will be dedicated to the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) route, and the Yangtze River ships will be dedicated to the Shanghai-Hankou line. All materials will be purchased from Britain. The coastal ships will be manufactured in Britain, and the Yangtze River ships will be manufactured at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai. The total cost is approximately 6-7 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Tax Exemption on Materials <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Once approved, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will immediately proceed, and plans to send personnel to Britain for negotiations. It will take approximately one year to complete the construction. As for the import of materials for the new ships, it is also planned to request the Ministry of Finance to follow the example of tax exemptions for materials for state-owned railways to provide incentives.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Today's Finance Meeting <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee is scheduled to convene a Finance Committee meeting today at approximately 4 p.m. to discuss the loan issue and review the loan proposal submitted by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, so that the committee can formulate a recommendation to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the Board of Directors for formal discussion. Then, after a substantial resolution is made, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be notified in writing. It is now known that members of the Finance Committee have received notifications, and Director-General Hang Liwu is scheduled to come to Shanghai today to participate. It is also rumored that if necessary, representatives from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be invited to the meeting to explain everything.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Day After Tomorrow's General Meeting <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After today's meeting, the committee will have a day of rest on Saturday. The day after tomorrow, Monday, the Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors General Meeting will be held. The main issues to be discussed at that time are the railway ministry's 4.52 million-pound loan contract and the Finance Committee's recommendation on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company loan proposal. The railway ministry's loan contract has already been drafted by the previous meeting. If it can be fully approved on that day, the contract can be signed in Nanjing soon.</p>
<h3 id="e134">General Meeting Proposals <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The important proposals for the 5th's General Meeting are two: (A) The Ministry of Railways' borrowing of 4.5 million pounds in British currency from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to complete the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, including ① a previously borrowed zero amount of 500,000 pounds, ② current installments of 740,000 pounds due from 1933 to 1937, ③ 1.6 million pounds for material purchases, and ④ 1.2 million pounds in railway bonds issued by the Railway Ministry, plus 100,000 pounds in interest. These four types of loans, totaling 4.5 million pounds, have been discussed by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Finance Committee for several months. On the 22nd of last month, the Finance Committee also finalized a general contract, resolving to submit it to the Board of Directors for review. Therefore, at the 5th's General Meeting, this case will be at its final critical stage. (B) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's case of borrowing 360,000 pounds to expand its shipping business, in preparation for purchasing ships, is also scheduled to be discussed at the 5th's General Meeting to determine whether to grant the loan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Anti-War Association sent a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission</p>
<h3 id="e135">Requesting a Ban on Arms Imports into Sichuan Province <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>As a Fundamental Measure to Curb the Source of Chaos</p>
<p>The General Association of the All-China Anti-Civil War League believes that in order to completely resolve the Sichuan war, a fundamental approach should be taken. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission requesting a ban on arms into Sichuan. The following is a transcription of the original telegram: To the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Administration of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of Nanjing: Having read the three resolutions of the 106th meeting of the Executive Yuan regarding the measures for reorganizing Sichuan's military and political affairs, we see the government's sincerity in thoroughly resolving the Sichuan situation. However, once the principles are established, the emphasis is on implementation. To put it on the right track, we must rely on authority. We urge you to implement it swiftly in accordance with the principles. If there is any disobedience, they should be punished according to national law. The fundamental way to eliminate civil war is to ban the import of weapons. We implore the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Military Administration to issue a strict ban, so that no party in Sichuan may import arms again, in order to curb the source of chaos and relieve the suffering of Sichuan. We are filled with anticipation. The General Association of the All-China Anti-Civil War League, respectfully. Winter.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Japanese Merchants Plan to Resume Yangtze River Shipping <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Following the recent signing of the Sino-Japanese agreement, the Japanese Post Office in this city has increased its number of ships by eight, dedicated to transporting Japanese goods to China. A ship arrives every two days, and each time, it imports 18,000 to 19,000 pieces of Japanese goods. The number of inferior goods imported into Shanghai each week is at least 60,000 pieces. Many are transferred to the Yangtze River. Therefore, from this month onwards, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (日淸汽船會社) has begun to reorganize its ships in preparation for resuming operations. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Dispatching Large Ships <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the number of Japanese goods transshipped from Shanghai to Hankou, Changsha, Yichang, and other ports has been increasing. Each time a Nisshin Kisen Kaisha Yangtze River ship exports, it transports approximately 500 to 600 tons. Although Nisshin currently only has four ships on the Shanghai-Hankou line, they have all been replaced with the largest Yangtze River ships, such as the Luoyang Maru, Fengyang Maru, Nanyang Maru, and Xiangyang Maru, operating three times a month. The import of goods is even better than the export of goods because Mitsui and others package rapeseed and miscellaneous grains for transfer to Japan. The operation of Japanese ships on the Yangtze River is gradually developing invisibly.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Selling Old Ships <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity to reorganize its Yangtze River ships, the company has decided to eliminate four old ships of the Dai (大) class that are over thirty years old and send them to Japan for sale. Among them, the Daifuku Maru, Daitori Maru, and Daitei Maru are docked in the river in front of the Meifu Wharf. The cabins have been dismantled, and wave-resistant bulkheads have been added to the cargo holds, as Yangtze River ships are not suitable for ocean voyages and must be modified with wave-resistant bulkheads. The Daijou Maru will also be modified. After these four ships are sold in Japan, four more ships will be sent.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Dismissing Seamen <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Among the Yangtze River ships being prepared to be sold in Japan, there are still a group of stokers and sailors, all of whom are Chinese. This group of seamen will all be dismissed after the ships are sold. However, they must sail to Japan, unload the ships, and then return to Shanghai to leave their jobs. Because the sailing date of each ship is approaching, Nisshin has already prepaid all the salaries of these workers in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Building New Ships <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Japanese merchants have no intention of abandoning or shrinking their Yangtze River shipping business. The company suffered huge losses during the more than one year of suspension of operations since the January 28th Incident. However, it has been able to survive with subsidies from the Japanese government. Now, it is planning to take advantage of the opportunity to resume operations as a plan to make a comeback. Therefore, the head office in Japan is selling old ships on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has been planning to build four to eight new Yangtze River ships to compensate for the tonnage and frequency of the eliminated ships.

<h3 id="e141">China Has Not Promulgated a Patent Law <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>On the 31st, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency saw Reuters reports in various newspapers stating that the British House of Commons was discussing trademark registration in China. British merchants complained that the registration regulations were ineffective and that the procedures were cumbersome. The British Trade Department spokesperson stated that as far as he knew, the registration had not yet taken effect. The reporter went to the Trademark Bureau to inquire about the truth. According to Director Ho Cheuk-yin, he also read Reuters' report in the local mainland newspapers in Shanghai, but the Reuters report in *The Times* stated that the British House of Commons was discussing patent law, not trademark law. Which of the two Reuters reports is accurate, he would not presume to say. Regarding patent law, our country has not yet promulgated any laws, nor is it convenient to express opinions. However, regarding trademarks, the bureau treats applications for registration from people of any nationality fairly and impartially in accordance with the law, except for the Soviet Union, where no trade agreement has been reached. The bureau's judgments on various cases are also based on the law, and there is absolutely no favoritism towards any nationality. Furthermore, the bureau does its best to protect the exclusive rights of registered trademarks in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>Song Zheyuan Sends Letter of Thanks</p>
<p>During the recent North China war, the Red Swastika Society's relief team, amidst intense artillery fire at key locations such as Xifengkou and Luowenyu, carried out burial work extremely well. They also calmly purchased trees and built houses to console the loyal soldiers. Yesterday, the society received a letter of thanks from Military Commander Song Zheyuan. The original letter is transcribed below for your information:</p>
<p>To the venerable gentlemen of the Red Swastika Society, during the battles at Xifengkou County and Wenyu waged by the enemy army, your esteemed society sent compassionate gentlemen such as Xiong and Xu to provide frontline relief. All the officers and soldiers who died in action were purchased land, prepared materials, gathered and buried in mounds, and trees were planted and houses built in front of the tombs to facilitate spring and autumn sacrifices, and to forever mark the great loyalty of the fallen. It is not only the deceased who were grateful, but also the living who were deeply moved. I, Zheyuan, have failed to serve the country, but I have received such great kindness. Remembering the hardships, I am deeply grateful for your kindness. I hereby respectfully send this letter to express my gratitude. Sincerely, Song Zheyuan, May 27.</p>

<p>There has been no regulation of Yangtze River pilots, which has left the gateways to key inland fortresses wide open. At this time of serious foreign aggression, the government, recognizing the deep and significant connection between this and wartime operations and national defense, has ordered that all practicing pilots must obtain a practicing certificate, and has ordered the Jianghai and Jianghan Customs, as well as the customs along the Yangtze River, to strictly inspect the pilot's licenses when ships arrive at their respective ports.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Overview of Relief Work for Women and Children <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association previously dispatched Deputy Director-General Chen Tiesheng to the northern war zone to work with all sectors to carry out relief work for women and children, as reported previously. It is now learned that Mr. Chen has safely arrived in the north and is working hard on the project. There are now more than 50,000 refugees in Beiping, with women and children accounting for 80 to 90 percent of them. Apart from a small number of middle-class families who are staying in hotels (some are staying with relatives), the majority are living in the open air, exposed to the wind and rain, in a very pitiful situation. Through the efforts of Mr. Wang Xizhi, director of the Child Welfare Group of the Beiping Church Federation, eight shelters have been established one after another. The funds are mostly provided by Mr. Qu Wenliu and Mr. Feng Yangshan, representatives of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. Mr. Zhang Yuanshan has also opened two shelters, which can accommodate thousands of people. In Tianjin, the Christian Relief Association has been organized and has sheltered more than 36,000 refugees, including more than 10,000 children. In Tongzhou, there are more than 20,000 women and children seeking refuge, with more than 12,000 being sheltered in the Luhe Middle School and more than 6,000 being sheltered in Catholic churches, Red Swastika Society shelters, mosques, etc. In addition, the Christian Girls' School and the Xuedaoyuan Church are also sheltering more than 1,700 people. Mr. Feng Yangshan has allocated 32,000 jin of rice to be transported to Tongzhou to provide relief to the refugees. Mr. Chen Tiesheng, on behalf of the Child Welfare Association, has also donated 500 yuan to purchase various types of infant food for approximately 3,600 boys and girls aged one to five, which is being distributed in various shelters.</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Interpretation</p>
<h3 id="e147">Doubts About the Statute of Limitations for Accounts <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a petition to the Judicial Yuan yesterday, stating that it was a petition for an issue. According to a letter from the Silk and Satin Trade Association, and in turn, a letter from the Xulun Store Group, the letter states that the amount of credit accounts issued by the group's members has been very large over the years. Traditionally, accounts have been settled three times a year. However, some customers may be staying in other cities or have gone overseas, and due to various special circumstances, they may only settle their accounts after three or five years. According to commercial practice, customer credit, and mutual understanding, this has been the case for a long time. Recently, however, a few customers who owe debts cite the</p>
<p>Two-Year Statute of Limitations to Resist Merchants' Claims for Payment. Such fraud and breach of faith, if this precedent is set, it is feared that the victims in the business world will be countless. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to quickly forward a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Judicial Yuan to interpret Article 127, Item 8 of the Civil Code, as to whether the two-year statute of limitations applies to the loans taken by customers from merchants in the silk and satin industry, and whether there are other remedies available to protect the legal interests of merchants, in case debtors insist on relying on this provision to avoid payment, and set a precedent that would not only cause great harm to the silk and satin industry, but would also affect the entire national economy. We earnestly beseech your assistance in forwarding this request for interpretation, and we will be deeply grateful. In view of this, the Chamber of Commerce believes that merchants rely entirely on credit when extending credit, and that if this precedent is set, creditors will lose their protection, while debtors will have a basis for evasion. If this continues, what business can be done? According to the circumstances described in the letter, we must urgently send a letter to your esteemed association, requesting you to quickly forward it to the Judicial Yuan to request an interpretation of the meaning and scope of Article 127, Item 8 of the General Principles of the Civil Code, so that there will be something to follow and to protect the legal interests of merchants. We will be publicly grateful. When the association was instructed to supplement the situation of whether a notice of account has been sent, regarding the so-called "excuse", whether it means that they are unable to repay and are requesting an extension to the next installment, if that is the case, it is considered an admission under Article 129, Item 2 of the same law, the statute of limitations is of course interrupted, and they should supplement their statements layer by layer, so as to forward the request for interpretation. Now, the trade association has replied, stating that member stores invariably sent billing notices to their credit customers at set intervals, without interruption. However, sending billing notices at these intervals is customary for all stores in the country, and there is no receipt or evidence of this. As for customers who have not settled their accounts, they not only send billing notices at set intervals, but also send personnel to collect the debts on a monthly basis. That is, they have never given up on exercising their right to claim. However, debtors often delay and postpone payment arbitrarily, or make excuses and go elsewhere to avoid meeting them, not indicating an inability to repay. We believe that shops are reluctant to initiate litigation lightly until repeated demands have failed and have become unbearable. If they are sued in court, it is argued that the statute of limitations of two years has expired, regardless of whether the article applies to accounts owed directly to users by retail stores. It is far-fetched and treated as the right thing, then how are the legal interests of the store protected? This is why we have to request a clear explanation so that we can follow the law. The Chamber of Commerce believes that, according to the above circumstances, merchants have not given up their right to claim, and there are facts to prove that the statute of limitations is interrupted, which seems to be the natural interpretation. According to the circumstances described in the letter, we hereby prepare a document to be submitted to the esteemed court for interpretation, which would be convenient for the public.</p>
<p>Family of Lin Huiyuan</p>
<h3 id="e148">Yesterday's Reception for the Press in Shanghai <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei and others, for the case of requesting the redress of injustice for the 19th Route Army regiment commander Li Jinduo's shooting of Longxi People's Education Center Director and Longxi Anti-Japanese Association Standing Committee Member Lin Huiyuan, now his family members Meng Yuan, etc., on the grounds that Huiyuan was wrongfully executed by Li Jinduo, with completely unfounded charges, abruptly silenced in the general public, specially came to Shanghai to appeal, so that the injustice would be made clear. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, at the Hua'an Building, they hosted members of the local press and the Civil Rights Protection Association, with more than 20 people attending. During the event, reports and speeches were given by the deceased Lin Huiyuan's descendants and Lin Mengwen, his father Lin Mengyuan, Lin Yutang, and others. Most of them said that the 19th Route Army, famous for its anti-Japanese stance, was transferred to Fujian to suppress bandits. At first, the people of Fujian all welcomed them, hoping they would come and take charge and relieve the people of Fujian from suffering. Unexpectedly, recently, their lower-level military officers have repeatedly engaged in the wrongful killing of innocent people, and Lin Huiyuan is just one of them, and so on. As for the cause of Lin's death, it was entirely because Lin severely punished the Taiwanese merchant Jian Mengchang, a doctor who purchased enemy goods, on May 5th, parading him in the streets and confiscating the property of his Gongji Hospital, leading to false accusations of collusion with bandits, resulting in his execution. The president of the local Civil Rights Protection Association, Song Qingling, had previously telegraphed Jiang Guangding, Cai Tingkai, and Chen Mingshu to intercede on his behalf. At the same time, about 20 people from the Shanghai literary and art circles, such as Cai Yuanpei, Liu Yazi, Lu Xun, and Yu Dafu, also issued a declaration, expressing the deep injustice of Lin's plight this time. The meeting adjourned after 5 o'clock. The telegrams and letters from Cai Yuanpei and others are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Liu Yazi, Yang Xingfo, Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Fu Sinian, Xia Gaizun, Ye Shengtao, Zhu Shaoping, Pan Guangdan, Sun Fuxi, Quan Zenggu, Li Qingya, Shao Xunmei, Yang Sao, Bai Wei, Zhang Yiping, Wu Shutian, Li Xiaofeng, Zhao Jingshen, and others' declaration for redressing the injustice of the Lin Huiyuan tragedy states: Recently, we saw in the newspapers that Lin Huiyuan, a standing committee member of the Longxi Anti-Japanese Association, was arrested on the 19th of last month on suspicion of colluding with bandits and executed by firing squad two hours later without any trial. We believe that Zhangzhou is not currently under martial law, so why was such a hasty disposition made? The news has caused a stir in southern Fujian, and it is rumored to be a suspicious case. When Huiyuan was in Shanghai, we all knew that he was straightforward in nature, and it was expected that he might offend local tyrants and be framed. Now, according to the report from his father Lin Mengwen, the concise case declaration from the Zhangzhou Anti-Japanese Association, and what was published in the Zhangzhou newspapers, we learned that there was a Taiwanese merchant named Jian Mengchang who, under the guise of local authority, purchased a large amount of enemy goods. Huiyuan, as a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese Association, advocated strict punishment and expulsion from the country, even arguing to the point of resignation, and eventually paraded Jian in the streets. This was on May 5th. As for Huiyuan's execution, it was on May 19th. Jian Mengchang, a Taiwanese national, was not only not expelled from the country, but was instead protected, a complete reversal of justice. Moreover, Huiyuan's death was neither handed over to any court nor subjected to any trial, but was summarily executed by firing squad in the camp upon the written request of the special service regiment commander Li Jinbo. When escorted to the execution ground, his mouth was clamped with a wooden stick to prevent him from crying out his injustice. As for the accusation of collusion with the communists, there was no evidence other than the so-called confession of Gao Cun, and Gao Cun was also executed by firing squad on the same day with his mouth clamped with a wooden stick to silence him. The slightest clue is not difficult to find. At a time when the country is facing many difficulties, the result for those who sincerely resist Japan is like this. It is not only the misfortune of the deceased's family, but also the misfortune of our country. Therefore, we specially seek redress so that the outside world can understand the truth.</p>
<p>Song Qingling's telegram to Jiang, Cai, and Chen, seeking redress for Lin Huiyuan, states: To Chairman Jiang of the Fujian Provincial Government, and forwarded to Commander-in-Chief Cai and Mr. Chen Zhenru, Longxi Anti-Japanese Association Standing Committee Member Lin Huiyuan severely punished the Taiwanese traitor Jian Mengchang, who purchased a large amount of enemy goods, on May 5th, parading him in the streets. He was then executed by firing squad on the 19th by Regiment Commander Li on suspicion of colluding with bandits. He was neither handed over to any court for trial, nor was Gao Cun, who allegedly implicated him, executed at the same time with his mouth clamped with a wooden stick to silence him. The injustice is deep and cannot be cleared. We hope that you, gentlemen, upholding your consistent anti-Japanese aspiration, will thoroughly investigate and redress the injustice, so as to preserve your reputation and reassure the people. Song Qingling.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei's telegram to Jiang, Cai, and Chen, seeking redress for Lin Huiyuan, states: To Chairman Jiang of the Fujian Provincial Government, and forwarded to Commander-in-Chief Cai and Mr. Chen Zhenru, I previously read in the newspapers that Lin Huiyuan of Longxi was executed by firing squad for colluding with bandits. His father is also a loyal party member, and I have known his younger brother for many years. I cannot believe this and am greatly surprised. Recently, after consulting the newspapers and news from his family, I learned that the Taiwanese Jian Mengchang, under the guise of local authority, purchased a large amount of Japanese medicine. The Anti-Japanese Association decided to confiscate it and expel Jian from the country. Huiyuan, as a standing committee member, was framed by villains. Without any trial, he was unjustly killed with his mouth clamped, causing a sensation far and wide. It cannot but tarnish the glorious anti-Japanese reputation of your army. Could you thoroughly investigate and seek redress, so as to show fairness and encourage those who come after? This would be a great fortune for the Party and the country. Cai Yuanpei.</p>
<p>Association for the Cooperation of National Goods Production and Sales</p>
<h3 id="e149">Supporting the Implementation of New Tax Rates <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association sent a quick mail telegram to various departments of the government yesterday to support the implementation of the new customs tariff, stating: To the Nanjing Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry: Customs autonomy is a common practice in all countries around the world. The level of customs tariffs is the linchpin of the rise and fall of industries. The government authorities, in order to maintain the country's sovereignty and seek the welfare of the people, should increase import taxes to limit the influx of foreign goods, and reduce export taxes to encourage the export of domestic products. Policies should come from our own decisions, and powers should be controlled by ourselves. In an independent and sovereign country, how can foreign interference be allowed? Since the opening of our country to foreign trade, customs tariffs have been low, and sovereignty has not belonged to us. As a result, foreign goods have been imported at very low tax rates, with low costs and prices, flooding the markets. The Chinese people, limited by short-term gains, often enjoy using them. On the other hand, export tax rates have not been reduced, and the output of domestic products is burdened heavily. Not only are natural products affected, but also manufactured goods, because most of the raw materials are imported from foreign countries, bear a double burden of taxation, directly and indirectly, increasing costs and making exports difficult. It is even more difficult to compete with foreign goods. This is why it is difficult for our country's industries to flourish, and why strong neighbors are able to carry out their economic aggression. Since the National Government regained customs autonomy, it has been able to exert its own strength in eliminating obstacles and supporting industries. Although the new customs tariff has slightly increased import tax rates, it is still not up to par compared to other countries in the world. However, according to reports, various Japanese trade associations in this city have convened a general meeting and submitted a petition to Minister Arima, requesting him to forward it to our authorities, obstructing and hindering us. Upon hearing this, we are shocked and astonished. Customs autonomy is a common practice in all countries, and the promulgation of tariffs is a matter within the scope of internal affairs. How can foreign countries be allowed to interfere? Our people have been subjected to restrictions for decades, and once we want to liberate ourselves, the Japanese recklessly disregard justice, rely on force to threaten us, and attempt to continue to control our destiny. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our people, in order to fight for our own survival and for the country's sovereignty, can only unite and implore the government to firmly reject and severely condemn them in accordance with reason, so as to maintain sovereignty and cultivate the foundation of the country. We are willing to make any sacrifice and vow to be the backing of the authorities, so as to ensure thorough implementation without any retreat. We earnestly state our case and hope for your consideration. Respectfully, China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Maritime Patrol Team directly under the Yangtze River Provincial Water Police Headquarters, on the pretext of issuing flag licenses and inspecting bandits in the waters where it is stationed, extorted flag license fees from fishing boats ranging from 30 to 50 yuan. Fishermen who were unable to pay were subjected to beatings. Fishermen and merchants had repeatedly telegraphed the Shanghai City Fishermen's Association and the Central Military Affairs Commission's Ministry of Industry requesting a telegram order to stop the practice. This has been reported in previous newspapers. After receiving the complaints from fishermen and merchants, the Shanghai City Fishermen's Association immediately sent an urgent telegram to the Yangtze River Provincial Water Police Headquarters and the Military Affairs Commission's Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry. A telegram from the Central Military Affairs Commission has now been received, stating: "The Shanghai City Fishermen's Association's telegram is received. Regarding Zhu Songzhou's abuse of power in issuing fishing boat flag licenses, the Director-General of the Water Police, Jiang, has been instructed by telegram to investigate and deal with the matter."

<p>Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated a dispute involving over sixty hat manufacturers in this city, including Dong Huasheng, Xu Yiyuan, and Xu Weiji. Due to the impact of the current situation, they changed the originally agreed-upon wages by offering discounts, which aroused opposition from the workers in various factories.

Wang Yuxiang and Li Xinfu represented the labor side's hat-making union, while Xu Senlin and Dong Guohua represented the management side's trade association. Tan Peiyan, a section member of the Social Affairs Bureau's Third Section, presided over the meeting. As a result, five measures were agreed upon: (1) For new-style straw edges, wages per dozen less than 60 cents will be calculated with a 20% increase, and those above 60 cents will be calculated with a 15% increase. (2) Wages that have already been settled, and those who are paid on a monthly basis or by piecework, are not subject to this rule. (3) If the labor is monthly and the term has been agreed upon by both parties, but the work has not yet expired, it will be calculated according to the following method: (A) If work is stopped after two months, one month's wages will be added (calculated as three months). (B) If work is stopped after three months, one month's wages will be added (calculated as four months). (C) If work is stopped after three and a half months, half a month's wages will not be added (calculated as four months). (D) If work is done for four months, no wages will be added (If five months have been specified, it will be calculated as five months. Temporary short-term labor is not subject to this rule.) (4) Apprentices will be calculated at 50% of the wages in the first year and 70% in the second year. (5) The various prices stipulated in the original contract for raw straw, coarse straw, and the original contract shall be calculated at 80% of the original contract.

<p>Guanghua Petroleum Company</p>
<h3 id="e160">Will Sue the Municipal Council <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>=Regarding the Installation of Gasoline Pumps=</p>
<p>=Disagreement with the Municipal Council's View=</p>
<p>The "Da Mei Wan Bao" reported that, according to a letter from William, the lawyer representing Guanghua Petroleum Company, to the Municipal Council, the company is planning to sue the Consular Court, hoping to force the Municipal Council to allow the company to install gasoline pumps within the prohibited area of the International Settlement. The so-called prohibited area was established several years ago, stipulating that within the International Settlement, from the Bund westward to a straight line drawn along the racecourse's Avenue Edward Ezra, the installation of gasoline pumps and oil tanks under the sidewalks is prohibited, but the installation on private property is not subject to the ban. Mr. Chung Sze of the Municipal Council sent a letter to William, the representative lawyer of Guanghua, on April 25, stating that the Municipal Council has extensive powers over the city-owned property within the Settlement and has the power to manage roads within the Settlement and formulate traffic regulations in accordance with the bylaws. William then replied that he could not agree with the Municipal Council's view, believing that imposing a restriction on the installation of gasoline pumps within a certain distance, especially outside this distance, would effectively create a monopoly for certain oil companies and deny the same rights to other taxpayers. If the Municipal Council is unwilling to negotiate in order to ease the existing restrictions, it will appeal to the Consular Court and ask the Municipal Council to indicate its views on this matter.</p>

<p>│Prosecuted by Clan Chief Qiu Hengzhi│</p>
<p>=Accused of Embezzling Public Property and Falsifying Clan Genealogy=</p>
<p>=Authentic and Fake Genealogies and Obituary Serve as Evidence=</p>
<p>After the death of the giant dye merchant Qiu Weiqing, he left behind millions in property, currently managed by his adopted son Qiu Changsheng and his biological son Qiu Changyin. As a result, lawsuits have repeatedly arisen. Recently, Qiu Hengzhi, the Qiu clan chief, over sixty years old, stated that Qiu Weiqing had said before his death that he would use 100,000 yuan for clan charities, and 200,000 yuan would be given to the clan to be incorporated into the ancestral hall, to purchase charitable fields, charitable estates, and charitable schools, and that over 120 mu of Bazhou rake tree fields would be allocated to the ancestral hall. However, since Weiqing's death, all these funds have been embezzled by Qiu Changsheng alone and taken as his own. Furthermore, because he is an adopted son, fearing disapproval from the entire clan, since the clan genealogy once contained the adoption wording, he spent money to buy up the clan genealogy and fabricate a new genealogy. Qiu Changsheng's actions are illegal. Therefore, he hired lawyers Zheng Wenkai and others to submit a petition to the First Special Court, accusing Qiu Changsheng of embezzling public property and falsifying the clan genealogy, requesting that he be punished according to Articles 356 and 224 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Wenji opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. First, the plaintiff Qiu Hengzhi explained the background, then lawyer Zheng further explained, and presented the authentic and fake genealogies, and Qiu Weiqing's obituary (containing wording about purchasing charitable fields, etc.) as evidence. When the defendant was questioned, he denied everything, saying that his father did not give any instructions regarding family matters when he passed away, so how could there be any mention of 300,000 yuan for charitable causes? He also hired lawyer Tao Jiachun for defense. The court stated that the case still required investigation and evidence, and ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

Mr. Fessenden requested that the representatives submit a written statement detailing the actual situation of wireless broadcasts, paying particular attention to avoiding technical difficulties in obstructing existing wavelengths, along with feasible solutions. He also expressed his willingness to present the matter to the Public Works Department's board meeting. However, it would be best to reach a friendly agreement to avoid mutual interference during broadcasts. He also stated that for the benefit of the public, the local authorities should discuss the matter to reach a mutual agreement and decision. In conclusion, to achieve a satisfactory solution, any measures should be implemented jointly with the Shanghai French Concession and the authorities.</p>

<p>This Year's Tea Inspection</p>
<h3 id="e165">New Standards Scheduled for Implementation <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Implementation Starts on June 20th</p>
<p>Colored Tea Will Be Banned Simultaneously</p>
<p>The standards for the 22nd year of tea inspection and the measures for banning colored tea, after being resolved by the Commodity Inspection Technical Conference, have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and approved for promulgation. The minimum inspection standards are similar to those of last year, but green tea has been changed to the No. 2 tea "Ben Hao Pearl Tea." The purpose of banning colored tea is to prohibit overly concentrated coloring and tea leaves containing toxic colorants. Because green tea for export, except for those shipped to America, is invariably colored, it not only hinders quality but is also harmful to health. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, in order to maintain the long-standing reputation of Chinese tea and promote international trade, has specially complied with the order to implement new standards and measures for banning colored tea starting on June 20th of this year. It has already formulated three types of colored tea standards that should be banned, and one minimum standard for black tea, along with the new standards and measures.</p>

<p>Four Kidnappers First Arrested in Shangxi Hotel</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued from Lane on Meixi Road Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Shen Sibao's son, Changsheng, a resident of Beicaozhen, Wujiang County, just fifteen years old, was suddenly kidnapped by kidnappers on the 10th of last month. They then sent a letter to his family, demanding 2,000 yuan for ransom. Shen initially requested a reduction, but the kidnappers refused, so the ransom was gradually increased to 1,900 yuan, which the kidnappers then accepted. The handover location was arranged in this city. On the evening before last, detectives Pang Yutang and Li Shugui of the Zhabei Police Station learned that the kidnappers were hiding in Room 3 of the Shangxi Hotel on Fuzhou Road. They rushed to investigate and arrest them at 10:00 PM that night, and arrested four men and women on the spot: Zhang Laozhang (also known as Zhang Bao) from Suzhou, Jin A'er, Fei Jinbao, and a woman from Changzhou, Lu Zhaizhen. Under questioning back at the police station, the kidnappers confessed that the hostage Shen Changsheng was currently being held at No. 3, Lane 74, Meixi Road in the city. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, Chinese and foreign detectives went to the location with the police district in charge, rescued the hostage, and arrested additional suspects, including Zhu Shuliang, Lin Hongchang, Zhou Shulin (i.e., Zhu Shulin), Shu Xiaodi, Shu Zhangshi, and several other men and women. They were temporarily detained at the police station. Zhang Laozhang and others were first escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi appeared in court, recounted the process of solving the case, and requested that Zhang and others be temporarily detained, and requested that the Municipal Public Security Bureau be asked to transfer the remaining suspects so that the case could be investigated and prosecuted together. Judge Qian approved the request, briefly questioned Zhang and others, and ordered them to remain in custody pending the arrest of the remaining criminals for a scheduled hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Improved National Product: French Gauze <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Cotton cloth is a good material for making clothes. This kind of fabric was made by hand in the past, so the quality is inevitably rough and the color is also dull and dull. However, in the past, there was no new competition from imported goods, and the aesthetic psychology of the general public was not as developed as it is now. Therefore, seeing that cotton cloth is lighter and smoother than native cloth, everyone is happy to use it. Nowadays, machine-woven clothing is novel, beautiful, and dazzling, and it is full of the market. This kind of hand-made cotton cloth is difficult to stand on its feet. The Zhenxing Textile Factory, in view of this, deeply regrets the decline of domestic products, and thinks of ways to save it. The factory's textile technicians and chemical engineers carefully studied and adopted the latest German machines, and through careful chemical engineering, produced a new type of cotton cloth, which is light, soft, and smooth in texture, and the color is simple, elegant, and pleasant. It is called "French Gauze." The price is very cheap, which is very suitable for the economy of today's society. Therefore, since its production, simple and aesthetic female comrades have been vying to buy and use it, and they have praised it. It is a new contribution to the national products industry. The factory has a store in the Penglai Market, Xiaoximen. It is very convenient for local women who love national products to visit.</p>

Subsequently, the Zhejiang authorities conducted several interrogations and investigated the actual situation, knowing that although He had sold sugar goods at Mitsui &amp; Co. before, he had completely cut off relations after September 18th.

<h3 id="e174">Police Officer Committed Suicide Out of Grief for National Affairs <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yongming Asked for Leave and Disappeared</p>
<p>The Life-Saving Bureau Retrieved the Body for Claim</p>
<p>Tang Yongming, a native of Beiping, 25 years old, was previously a police officer in the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau. Since the Shanghai War, Tang followed the team to Shanghai. Then, in May of last year, he was ordered to be transferred to the First District, First Precinct of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau as a third-class police officer. The police officer was very diligent in handling affairs on weekdays, and he was taciturn and rarely smiled, so he was highly valued by his superiors. However, recently, the military situation in Beiping was urgent, and Tang's family members lived in Beiping, so Tang was very worried, and often frowned and sighed repeatedly, and said to his colleagues that the national crisis was imminent, and the Japanese army was so barbaric, how would we live in the future? His colleagues did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 PM on the 29th of last month, Tang suddenly asked his superior for leave to go out for a bath, and never returned. The precinct reported the situation to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for approval. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 PM the night before last, the patrol boat of the Tongren Fuyuantang Life-Saving Bureau at Nanmatou suddenly retrieved a male corpse from the nearby water, about twenty years old, wearing a white cloth short shirt, black pants, black thread socks on his feet, and colored shoes. He was brought back to the bureau for identification. It was then learned by the precinct, so they sent the police to inspect it. The deceased was the police officer Tang Yongming who had been missing for two days, who had committed suicide by throwing himself into the river. He immediately reported to the chief of the precinct, assigned a local headman, and reported to the Shanghai Local Court to ask for an autopsy, prepared a coffin for burial, and telegraphed his family to come to Shanghai to claim the body.</p>

<p>│A Handgun Without a License is Suspicious│</p>
<p>At 4:50 AM yesterday morning, inside the Dahua Dance Hall on Dongqiujiang Road, Zhabei, when the dancers were dancing happily, a beauty named Gao Bāluóbāsī suddenly had a conflict with a Russian named Aìbǐ Luósè because they disagreed. Gao punched Ai in the face, causing Ai's left eye to swell up immediately. At the same time, Ai took out a handgun from his pocket and tried to fire at Gao. Gao, upon seeing this, had nowhere to escape, so he shouted for help. The police officer on duty at Post No. 5 of the First Precinct of the Fifth District heard this, and rushed in to see the situation. He bravely stepped forward and snatched the handgun from Ai. He saw that it contained seven bullets. He searched his body again and found four more bullets. He asked if he had a gun license, but he hesitated. He was taken to the First Precinct and reported. Liang Fuchu, the director of the precinct, personally interrogated him, but the Russian never handed over a gun license. At the same time, there were four more bullets hidden in his pocket, which was suspicious. He was first sent to the nearby Fumin Hospital to examine his injuries, and then, at about 1:00 PM, he, along with the guns and bullets, was transferred to the Third Section of the General Bureau for questioning. The beauty Gao Bāluóbāsī was also sent to the Diswei Road Police Station for processing at the same time.</p>

<p>│Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment with Probation│</p>
<p>Chai Bingsheng, a wealthy merchant from Huzhou, had accumulated a great deal of wealth during his lifetime, especially jewelry. When he and his wife died one after another, his son Yanxu was still young, so he entrusted his close relatives Pan Xiangsheng and Ji Zhongren to take care of him. All the deeds and jewelry were stored in the Xingye Bank for safekeeping by Pan and others. Pan was Yanxu's uncle and Ji was his cousin, so they could not refuse. Ten years ago, Pan and Ji thought that Chai Yanxu had grown up and that they could unload their responsibility for safekeeping, so they returned all the items clearly. Unexpectedly, recently, Chai Yanxu hired lawyers Qin Liankui and Chang Zhihao to file a criminal lawsuit against Pan and Ji, saying that they had embezzled property. Pan and others said that the ornaments they were in charge of had already been returned, but Chai actually repaid kindness with hatred, which was intolerable. They also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to not only clarify the facts, but also filed a counterclaim against Chai Yanxu, asking for him to be punished for false accusations. After several times of summoning both parties and witnesses by the First Special District Local Court for investigation, the judge persuaded them to reconcile because the two sides were close relatives. However, Pan and others believed that Chai's actions were not only fabricated and falsely accused, but also intentionally damaged their reputation, and finally it was impossible to settle peacefully. Now the case has been tried and concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the presiding judge opened the court and announced the verdict. Pan and Ji were both innocent. Chai Yanxu's false accusation was true. He was sentenced to two months in prison to warn him, but he was given probation for two years because it was his first time.</p>

<p>││Letter from Zhao Yujun of Wujin││</p>
<p>Every day I see you gentlemen solving difficult problems for readers, and now it's my turn ││ Actually, it's a problem faced by most of the business community, currently oppressed by the Business Tax Bureau to the point of having no way out. I know that discussing this now will not help the overall situation. But this is the groan of the masses, and it is worth discussing!</p>
<p>This year, twenty-one of the twenty-seven money houses in Changzhou City have already collapsed, and the remaining six are in constant turmoil. Other industries are also closing down more than opening, and the decline of the business community can be imagined! The sharp increase in unemployed youth and the hardship of ordinary people's lives are not even considered by the so-called public servant officials? Recently, the squeezing has become even more severe. For example, the recent business tax: goods of category A are taxed at 5 per thousand, and if sold to category B, category B must also be taxed at 5 per thousand; if category B resells to category C, category C must be taxed at 5 per thousand again; sold repeatedly, taxed layer by layer; regardless of whether they are luxury goods or daily necessities for ordinary people, and those who have already paid national tax are also subject to tax, alas! Is the original intention of national taxation like this?</p>
<p>[Oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger, and corrupt officials are more poisonous than snakes;] I think now it is the Republic of China, and the government is definitely not a tiger? Officials are not poisonous snakes? They are our public servants. If public servants do something wrong, the masters should come out to correct them. Is that good or not? Respectfully ask the │talented│ editor: (1) Is opposing harsh taxes endangering the Republic of China? (2) Are goods that have already paid national tax obligated to pay business tax? (3) If [poisonous snakes] bite people, what method should we use to eliminate them?</p>
<p>Answer: The social phenomenon described in the letter is a realistic picture of the widespread bankruptcy in China today. Not only is Changzhou like this, but Zhenjiang is also like this. There are several dozen money houses in Zhenjiang, but only six or seven are listed this year. As for the banks, they are still the same, and even added one or two. From this, we can at least see: ㈠ The trend of China's usurious capital and commercial capital being swallowed up by banking capital: ㈡ Rural bankruptcy, farmers unable to repay debts, the silk and yarn industries in the Suhangchang area went bankrupt, and most of the cash flowed out from the inland, returning to Shanghai. The inland money houses are unable to circulate, and nineteen out of ten are closing down. Not only are Zhen and Chang like this, but other major cities such as Hangzhou, Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai are also like this. "The government is definitely not a tiger? Officials are definitely not poisonous snakes?" The decision of this kind of question should not be based on its name ││ the so-called "public servant" ││ but should be based on its facts; it should not be based on its announcements, but should be based on its administration. The remaining three questions are answered together as follows: ㈠ Opposing harsh taxes is definitely not "endangering the Republic of China"; not only does it not endanger it, but it also maintains it. Because a true republic absolutely does not allow harsh taxes, and tolerating harsh taxes, even rewarding harsh taxes with "officials competing for profit from top to bottom," is definitely not a republic but an enemy of the republic. ㈡ In theory, goods that have already paid national tax should not be subject to any taxes. Even if there is a need to levy tax out of necessity, the people must understand, trust, and promise that this tax is for the country and for the people. If the people only have the obligation to pay taxes but have no way to understand, let alone trust, and even have no right and opportunity to promise or reject this tax, then the people, according to the law, have no obligation to pay harsh taxes at all. ㈢ If it is really a poisonous snake, it will definitely bite people, and we should eliminate it. The ancient Chinese had a saying, "To kill a snake, strike at its seven inches" │ this saying still has considerable significance today. However, we must know that the poisonous snakes today are not one, but a group. Then, the method of killing snakes today can no longer be thought of as an individual action, that is to say, it can no longer be eliminated by individual strength. Only by uniting can we eliminate this group of snakes.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Calculation of Grid Bias Resistor <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Xiang</p>
<p>Whether a vacuum tube is used for high-frequency or low-frequency amplification, there must be a proper negative voltage on the grid. There are two sources of this negative voltage: the first is to use a set of C batteries connected in the grid circuit to supply it; the second is to use a resistor connected in the grid circuit, using the voltage drop generated when the plate current passes through this resistor to supply it. AC radios on the market all use the second method. The resistance value of this resistor is very important and must be accurate, otherwise the effectiveness of the vacuum tube will be completely lost. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e195">Grid Resistor <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>㈠ Calculation Method of Resistance Value</p>
<p>First, check the required grid voltage and plate current values of the vacuum tube on the specification sheet of various vacuum tubes (this sheet is included in the instruction manual when purchasing the vacuum tube and in radio books). According to Ohm's law, divide the grid voltage by the plate current. The quotient obtained is the resistance value that this grid bias resistor should have. If it is a screen-grid vacuum tube, the screen-grid current must also be included in the plate current calculation. For example, for a 247 vacuum tube, the grid negative voltage should be 16.5 volts, the plate current is 31 milliamperes, and the screen-grid current is 6 milliamperes, then the grid bias resistor should be 16.5/(0.031 + 0.006) = 445 ohms.</p>
<p>㈡ Calculation Method of Resistor Power Size</p>
<p>When purchasing a resistor, in addition to the resistance value, you should also pay attention to the power it can withstand. The unit of power is watts. The calculation method is also very simple. Just multiply the current by itself and then multiply by the resistance value. The product is the size of the power. For example, the power of the resistor in the previous example should be 0.0372 x 445 = 0.6 watts. In actual application, for safety, it is best to use a resistor three times the power, so the power limit marked on this resistor should be two watts.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Self-Made High Resistance <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Qi</p>
<p>The components used in radio equipment seem very complicated at first glance, but when summarized, in addition to vacuum tubes, most of them are capacitors, coils, and resistors, connected in circuits, with endless changes.</p>
<p>There are many publications in books and magazines about the making of capacitors and coils. However, there is still little self-made information about resistors. The reasons are (1) it is not easy to measure its resistance, (2) it is not heat-resistant (that is, the power in watts is not large), but according to my experiments, the high resistance used in ordinary radios (mostly AC ones) is less than one watt. For example, in a three-tube radio, the step-down resistor used in the detector tube is about 40,000 ohms, and the current passing through it is at most 5 milliamperes (5MA). If it is a 27 vacuum tube, the current during detection is less than 3 milliamperes, then the inherent watts of the above resistor is 12 x R (0.003) 2 x 40,000 = 0.36W. According to the above formula, it can be known that the heat resistance of the resistor is directly proportional to its resistance B at equal current.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the making method. Speaking of fixed ones, the materials needed are just a few good matches (according to the experiment, the domestic product "Meili" brand is the best), thick ink, a 6B or soft pencil, and a small square of thin copper sheet. For the making method, first soak the match in ink so that it is completely soaked and dried. If the resistance needs to be very large, such as 2Meg or 1/2Meg, then there is no need to apply lead again, but sometimes a little is also needed. If it is 40,000 ohms, then it must be fully coated. Then cut the thin copper skin into a convex shape and wrap it on the match (Figure 1). According to the above method, it can also be said to be semi-variable. Just move the copper sleeve to change its distance. The closer it is, the smaller the resistance, or vice versa. The experiment has shown that when the match is fully coated with black lead, at 40,000 ohms, it is about one centimeter (cm) apart, and at about 1,000 ohms (used as a substitute C battery), the closer the two are, the better. However, there is no fixed ratio between the resistance and its distance, because the amount of lead varies greatly and must be determined by experiment. If you want it to be more perfect, you can hide this resistor in a thin glass tube and seal both ends with sealing wax.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to use variable ones, such as for volume control (around ro, ooo｜Ioo｀ooo ohms), for push-pull control, and potentiometers, etc., then you can follow the second diagram to do it. The materials are also very economical. The disc is made of hard rubber. About one-fourth thick is enough. Punch a hole in the middle: or remove the resistance wire from the old variable resistor. Various making methods will be very clear after looking at the second diagram. Its function is to move the copper skin on the absorbent paper, indirectly changing its distance. Whether to apply lead or not is the same as the fixed one and must be experimented with yourself. Due to space limitations, I cannot elaborate more. The method of measuring high resistance will be described in detail in another article.</p>

<p>If tin foil is sandwiched between the copper skin and the match, it will be easier to conduct electricity and more heat-resistant.</p>

<p>Now that the weather is getting hotter, lightning often occurs. Anyone with an antenna should have a lightning arrester to prevent it. Now I will introduce a lightning arrester that costs very little and has the same effect as those sold on the market. You might as well give it a try. The making method is as follows:</p>
<p>Prepare a piece of copper sheet three inches long and two inches wide, a piece of wood, and two screws. First, use scissors to cut the copper sheet into very sharp canine teeth. Cut two pieces of copper sheet in the same way and screw one end onto the wood with screws. The pointed teeth should be as close as possible, but not touching, to form a short circuit. Once made according to the above method, the lightning arrester is successful. Its wiring is shown in the left figure.</p>

<p>The above describes the phenomena, causes, and treatment methods of five kinds of radio defects. Although there are only a few tables, I think the explanation of the table is clearer and more powerful than the description in words. The reader can find various defects and how to deal with them by following the diagram. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e200">AC Radio Inspection Method <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Quan</p>
<p>What makes people most unhappy when playing with AC radios is that the radio has various faults, such as AC hum, constant crackling, or even no sound at all. When you encounter this situation, you have to repair it yourself. But although it is not difficult to start, it is not very easy to find out where the defect is. Often, one symptom has more than a dozen causes. Moreover, the internal circuit of the radio is complex and the wiring is chaotic, which makes people more easily at a loss. The author will now introduce an inspection method. If you check according to the method, even the most subtle places can be easily detected. You only need to prepare a DC voltmeter. This meter must be able to measure zero to six volts and zero to two hundred volts. And two connecting wires. For the sake of simple explanation, take the final stage of an ordinary AC radio as an example and explain it separately.</p>
<p>The figure shows the final stage amplification and power supply section. T is the final stage low-frequency transformer, Vi is the amplifier tube, V2 is the rectifier tube, P.T. is the power transformer, AFC is the choke coil, C1C2 are the filter capacitors, R2 is the substitute C resistor, C3 is the bypass capacitor, and R1 is the center resistor (some do not use the center resistor because the power transformer already has a center tap). The inspector should first turn on the radio and then check its plate, grid, and filament circuits separately.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Plate Circuit <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Connect the negative pole of the voltmeter to point 11 of R1, and connect the positive pole of the high-voltage end (that is, the zero to two hundred volt section of the voltmeter) to point 2 in the figure. At this time, the speaker is not connected, so the pointer on the meter does not move. If the speaker is connected and the meter pointer still does not move, you can change the positive wire to point 3. If the pointer moves, the speaker coil is broken. If the pointer still does not move, change to point 5. If the meter pointer moves, the AFC is broken. If the pointer still does not move, then change to point 6. If the pointer moves, there is a break in the connection between 6 and 5. If the pointer still does not move, the rectifier tube is broken. Try replacing it with a new one. If the pointer still does not move, the high-voltage wire of the power transformer is damaged or C1C2 is short-circuited. At this time, or change the negative pole of the voltmeter to the ground wire. If the meter pointer moves, R1 is damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Grid Circuit <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Change the voltmeter to the low-voltage section (that is, zero to six volts). Connect the negative pole to point G in the figure and connect the positive pole to point Ⅱ. You can measure a voltage of about two volts. Then the grid circuit is undamaged. If the meter pointer does not move, C3 must be short-circuited or R2 must be broken.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Filament Circuit <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The filament circuit of an AC radio is alternating current, so a DC voltmeter cannot be used to measure the correct voltage value. However, you can usually determine it by looking at the brightness of the filament. If the vacuum tube is not bright, you can replace it with a new one (or use the light bulb in a flashlight as a substitute). If it is still not bright, then the power transformer or the wiring is broken.</p>
<p>The above is all about the final stage, but the primary and secondary stages are the same. You can check them according to the steps described above. As for the order of checking the three circuits, it depends on the symptoms. If the light is not on, check the filament circuit first. If it is bright but there is no sound, check the plate circuit first. If there is sound but it is not clear, or there is noise, check the grid circuit first. Finally, there are a few words to pay attention to.</p>
<p>㈠ When a radio has symptoms, you must first check the antenna, ground, and lightning arrester.</p>
<p>㈡ After checking out one defect, you must check whether there are other defects.</p>
<p>㈢ Each time, record it for future reference.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Method to Avoid Strange Noises <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>When experimenting with AC radios yourself, it is often easy to generate many strange noises. The following are the most common types:</p>
<p>(1) Regenerative radios are most sensitive to receiving external broadcasts when they are about to oscillate. However, at this time, a kind of "pat-pat" sound similar to the sound of a gasoline boat releasing air (Motorboating) often occurs, disturbing the correct sound and is very annoying. The remedy is to first reduce the detector's B voltage. If it is ineffective, replace the bypass capacitor of the detector B voltage with a 2mf one (see Figure 1). (2) When the radio is about to oscillate, in addition to the above-mentioned sound, sometimes a long whistling sound (Frinkhow) (roughly in the shorter wavelength range) will also occur. If a 0.1｀2Meg ohm resistor is connected in parallel on the secondary coil of the first-stage low-frequency amplifier transformer, it can be avoided. This kind of noise can also be avoided in the same way when it occurs in DC radios (see Figure 2).</p>
<p>(3) Sometimes a noise occurs when the radio is first turned on, and it returns to its original state after the filament heats up. Although this special phenomenon is harmless, it is still annoying. The remedy is the same as in item 2.</p>
<p>(4) When the radio does not oscillate, a noise occurs, but not when it oscillates. The method to avoid it is to lay a piece of copper skin on the bottom of the box and connect the copper skin to the ground wire.</p>
<p>In addition, if the grid circuit is close to the plate circuit, the detector tube does not use a shield, and the grid leak value is too small... various noises can also occur. Due to space limitations, I will not elaborate on them here.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Sketch of the Examination Venue <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The examination venue is located in the old site of the Police Academy inside Nanweimen, divided into seven examination halls. Senior high school occupies one examination hall exclusively, with mixed male and female students. Junior high school boys occupy five examination halls in total, and girls occupy one examination hall exclusively. Each examination table has a seat number posted on it. Male and female restrooms and cafeterias are all divided. Starting at 5:00 AM, the students taking the examination arrived at the venue one after another. Three years of hard work are at stake here, so they are all extremely serious. The boys are either wearing uniforms or casual clothes, while the girls are all in casual clothes, either ethnic robes or blue jackets and green skirts, with different shapes and colors. Each student wears a temporary entry and exit pass on their chest. The chief examiner, He Siyuan, Director of the Department of Education, arrived early. The supervisors were Hu Jiji, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, representing Prosecutor Li Qinhe, and Zhou Chenglie, Mayor of Jinan, representing Director of the Education Bureau Zhang Hongjian. Other assistant examiners, secretaries and section chiefs of the Department of Education, all arrived. At 6:30, the chief examiner, He Siyuan, together with the assistant examiners, distributed the names in seven places and entered the hall in an orderly manner. The examination began at 7:00.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Strict Security Measures <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Education regards the joint examination as a grand ceremony for selecting talents, so the security measures are extremely strict. The examination papers are all sealed, and the examination papers and questions are locked in a safe. After the students shake the bell and enter the examination hall, the assistant examiners and supervisors open the safe to take out the examination questions and papers and distribute them to the hall. Whether it is the chief examiner, assistant examiner, supervisor, examinee, or worker in the hall, they all wear symbols. Those without symbols are not allowed to enter. There are recent photos of each student on the name list. It is necessary to match the person with the photo before they can enter the hall to take the examination. In addition to the two supervisors, Li Qinhe and Ye Hongjian, taking turns to go to each hall for supervision, there are three other supervisors in each examination hall to supervise internally.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 3 p.m., Dr. Zhu Jiqing from the Department of Health gave a lecture entitled [Health Education from a Behavioral Perspective]. The main idea was that the period from four months to four years old is the most important time to develop good hygiene habits for infants. Teachers should use good methods to guide them, such as (1) placing normal children with abnormal children and using good caregivers for guidance, and (2) using student leaders as role models. He then talked about sex education, stating that to prevent venereal diseases, it is necessary to start with children aged three or four, so that they understand correct sexual knowledge. The lecture was detailed and moving. Today from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., Dr. Yang Suzhen, a female medical doctor, will give a lecture entitled [How to Develop Healthy Habits for Children].</p>

<h3 id="e220">Opinions on What Provincial and County Education Bureaus Should Preserve <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Since the internal affairs conference proposed changing the county organization law, increasing the authority of county magistrates, and changing the various sections, various provinces have followed suit, and many have already implemented it.</p>
<p>Whether changing bureaus to sections is better than establishing separate bureaus is not discussed here. But taking the change of the education bureau to a section of the county government as an example, analyzing it from the aspects of theory, history, facts, national conditions, and numbers, it is really not appropriate.</p>
<p>In theory, education is a specialized undertaking, not comparable to other ordinary political affairs. Educational administration must be presided over by someone familiar with education in order to be enthusiastic and competent. The county magistrate is an ordinary official, not familiar with education. Once charged with educational administration, it is easy to be neglected due to different concepts, or even if it is not neglected, the situation is still unfamiliar, and the measures are inevitably inappropriate.</p>
<p>Historically, since the establishment of schools in China, except for a few provinces, the educational administration of various counties has been managed by separate bureaus. This has been the case for decades. Even in the old imperial examination era, each county had educational officials such as instructors and guides to manage educational affairs, which were always separate from ordinary administration. The situation in European and American countries is also the same. Local educational administration is often set up in bureaus or other similar bodies, clearly separated from ordinary administration. Even the Shanghai Special District now has a so-called [Chinese Education Department] to manage schools, without entrusting the so-called [Chinese education] to ordinary officials. In fact, in a few provinces in China, the educational administration of various counties does not have a separate education bureau, but the establishment of schools is far less than in provinces with bureaus, and the educational achievements are also far less than in provinces with bureaus. According to investigations, in a certain province, some counties have changed bureaus to sections, and some county magistrates or administrative commissioners have misappropriated education funds, and some have disregarded education laws and insisted on their own ideas. Even county magistrates who are somewhat knowledgeable about education are struggling to discuss school affairs with principals and are too busy to have any plans for education. The facts are all there and cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Regarding national conditions, education in China is still in its infancy. Having a separate bureau is still worried about being constrained by ordinary administration, unable to concentrate on developing education and making long-term progress. Therefore, after the League of Nations Education Inspection Group came to China to inspect education, they suggested [educational administration should be further free from interference from ordinary administration] and advocated that [the heads of county education bureaus should be appointed by the provincial education department]. This shows a deep understanding of China's national conditions, not only advocating the establishment of bureaus to manage educational administration, but also wanting it to be completely free from the interference of county magistrates.</p>
<p>Some say, [Changing bureaus to sections can save more money in terms of expenses. This is a last resort when local governments are empty.] However, setting up a bureau has a director, supervisors, staff, and secretaries, while changing to a section still has a section chief, supervisors, staff, and secretaries. There is no significant difference in the number of people and their treatment. Moreover, if the funds are small, the scope can be small. What is the difference between setting up a bureau and a section?</p>
<p>Some also say, [After changing bureaus to sections, the section chief can be directly appointed by the provincial education department, without being completely controlled by the county magistrate, which is still equivalent to setting up a bureau.] However, working in the same organization, the section chief is ultimately a subordinate. If their views differ from the county magistrate, opposing them would be considered insubordinate, while following them would be uneasy. Between going and staying, there are many obstacles. Moreover, if changing bureaus to sections does not create any obstacles and is still equivalent to setting up a bureau, then why bother with this unnecessary move? Based on the above reasons, it is advocated that the existing county education bureaus that have been changed to sections should be restored as soon as possible within a possible scope. Those that have not yet established bureaus should also consider establishing them at an appropriate time. The government should clearly stipulate that the principle of county educational administration should be to establish bureaus to manage it, and no matter how the county organization law changes, this principle should be preserved and not replaced, in order to emphasize education and assign responsibilities.</p>

<p>University Joint Petition to the General Training Headquarters</p>
<h3 id="e223">Strictly Order All Schools to Implement Military Training <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai University Student Union has paid great attention to military training in various schools. Yesterday, in order to strictly implement summer military training, it submitted a special petition to the Ministry of Education and the General Training Headquarters, requesting a strict order to all universities in Shanghai to earnestly implement summer military training. The petition stated that the Japanese imperialists are using violence to oppress us, placing our country on the line of life and death. At this critical moment, all our citizens should mobilize together and urgently prepare for self-defense. Our young students should especially rise up together and be the pioneers of mobilizing the people. The only way to achieve effective self-defense mobilization is through military training. According to reports, your ministry has issued instructions to all schools across the country to strictly implement summer military training, which demonstrates your foresight and knowledge of what is most important. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, most of the authorities of universities in Shanghai are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and have not made any preparations. The union is deeply concerned that this situation will not only betray the desire of young students to take up arms to defend the country, but also fail to live up to your ministry's active advocacy. In addition to organizing a military training committee to actively plan and intensify training methods, and urging the authorities of various schools to implement it nearby, the union dares to submit this petition, hoping that you will examine and approve it, and strictly order the authorities of all schools in Shanghai to earnestly implement the summer military training measures set by your ministry, as it is in the public interest.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has always paid attention to promoting sports. The staff of the bureau usually engage in business processing and have few opportunities for actual practice. In order to exercise their physical fitness, they have first organized volleyball, tennis, and basketball teams, which are divided into groups to practice after work. Once the practice is mature, they plan to invite outsiders to observe their skills. It is heard that the bureau director, section chiefs, supervisors, and most of the staff have jointly launched preparations.</p>
<p>19th Route Army Football Team</p>
<h3 id="e230">First Match Drawn with Fudan <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>=The 19th Route Army forwards are brave and their performance is excellent=</p>
<p>=The Fudan team's defense is solid and their strength is balanced=</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army football team met the Fudan football team at the China Baseball Field yesterday afternoon at 4:30 p.m. In this match, both sides showed beautiful skills. With a spirit of fearlessness, they fought hard for seventy minutes, stirring up dust and making it difficult to distinguish between people and the ball. As a result, the match ended in a 0-0 draw.</p>
<h3 id="e231">The 19th Route Army is Imposing <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army football team is strong and well-equipped. With the addition of Jiang Meijing and Zhong Yongsen, they are even more impressive. Seventy to eighty percent of the game was spent attacking and surrounding. The only regret is that they could not score the final goal as they wished. The wings contributed greatly, and the center was also excellent. The center back line and inner defense advanced and retreated in an orderly manner. In the future, with the addition of Feng Jingxiang, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, and Zhu Guolun, their strength will be so tenacious that it will be beyond our expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Fudan Team Resists a Strong Enemy <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The Fudan team, the champion of the China Football League, encountered a strong enemy for the first time yesterday, like a lone boat struggling in a storm. Fortunately, the entire army gave their all, and they were able to reach the other shore safely and end the match in a draw. At the beginning of the contact between the two armies, they attacked three times and were once very powerful. However, before long, the difference in strength gradually became clear, so they retreated to strategic passes and adopted a defensive strategy. All eleven people did their best, especially goalkeeper Yang Mingjin, who had extraordinary skills. However, once the city gate was wide open and the ball hit the wooden post, and once it was only a foot away from the goal, but the ball was shot high into the sky. Furthermore, there were three penalty kicks, but they turned bad luck into good fortune. This was not without good fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e233">The Back-and-Forth Lasted a Long Time Without a Winner <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Referee Shen Huichun blew his silver whistle, and the clouds of war rose. The Fudan team waited at their ease and had many advantages. Five minutes later, the forwards attacked three times, but failed repeatedly due to lack of coordination. Zhou Shaowen, Yu Shunzhang, and Feng Nianhan were all formidable. Jiang Shanjing was bold and powerful. The 19th Route Army's defense had this pillar, so although there were many alarms, the fire did not spread. Before long, Fudan midfielder Wang Shusen was transporting military supplies during the kickoff when he was intercepted by Xu Yaoguang, who passed it to Yang Benhan. This led to an uprising in the eastern suburbs, which was difficult to quell, so he had no choice but to kick the ball far away. Huang Meishun failed to make a decisive decision and missed the opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Yu Shunzhang Misses Twice <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The Fudan soldiers were all shocked. Black-faced General Zhang Ke roared angrily, and the ball broke through the encirclement. Huang Shunyue failed to attack, and Yu Shunzhang and Hong Nianhan supported each other and advanced in a linked manner, entering the encirclement in an instant. Jiang Shanjing and Zhou Dayun were entangled, and Yu Shunzhang was in the best position, but he could not shoot. How frustrating! Two minutes later, Hong Nianhan could have sent a ball to the 19th Route Army's goal, but Yu Shunzhang was one step slower, and the military was formed with old fists, and the ball was released dangerously.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The 19th Route Army Attacks Fervently But Fails <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The sides switched again, and the 19th Route Army's forwards were radiant. In the Fudan penalty area, the artillery fire was earth-shattering, and the situation was full of dangers. Wang Shusen hurriedly transferred Zhao An and the other two generals back to help defend. Yu Shunzhang and Feng Nianhan also took the opportunity to rush to the rear defense to help block. There were many obstacles in the kickoff line. Zhong Yongsen and Zheng Shaokang went in and out ten times, but it was difficult to achieve success. Huang Meishun was under the strict surveillance of Wang Shusen and found it difficult to fight. In the end, they could not open the deadlock, and the match ended 0-0.</p>

<p>│Reception for the 19th Route Army Football Team│</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army Youth Service Corps held a reception last night at the Da Jiali Hotel for the Shanghai press and sports circles. Wang Xiaolai, Hu Fengxiang, Yang Pufu, and Zhou Fuzhang, the senior advisors of the corps, Jin Huating, the representative of the Journalists Association, Chen Bingde, the director of sports at Fudan, Yu Hengzhi, the director of sports at Jinan, reporters from Shen Bao, Shi Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shishi Xinbao, and Chen Bao, and players from Jinan and Fudan, a total of more than 80 people, gathered together in a lively atmosphere. After several rounds of drinks, Jin Yiting, the head of the corps, gave a welcome speech. Then, Secretary Wu Qinyao stood up to report on the organization of the corps and the mission of the football team in Shanghai. He said that this time, the 19th Route Army vanguard team volunteered to resist Japan. The head of our corps, Jin Yiting, and the youth of Guangdong Province sacrificed their original positions in order to fulfill their national responsibilities and followed the troops to participate in the work in the war zone. Their biggest goal is to save the country and the nation. The corps is divided into five sections (propaganda, transportation, medical care, general affairs, and sports) to cooperate and work together. The first batch of corps members has already departed from Guangdong with the first column commander Zhang Yan and has reached Chenzhou, Hunan Province. The second batch of corps members includes many famous football players from Nanhua, led by Shan Jingyuan, the head of the sports section, to Shanghai to prepare for competitions along the way. On the one hand, they will use this to arouse the public to participate in the anti-Japanese work together, and on the other hand, they will raise funds through competitions to help war refugees and purchase medical supplies. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. When the football team arrived in Shanghai, there were no opponents. Our corps always thought that the China National Sports Association was the highest sports organization in the country. When the football team arrived in Shanghai, they immediately visited Mr. Shen Siliang, the main person in charge, hoping that the association would help. Our corps came to Shanghai for the first time and did not understand the situation here. After several negotiations, the association was afraid that there would be political implications, which caused obstacles. Secondly, because the football season has ended, they could not gather the team to help. Fortunately, the two friendly teams of Jinan and Fudan could not bear to see our team make an empty trip and agreed to play a friendly match. The others who wanted to compete with our team were disappointed because there was no venue. The second batch of warriors of our team will arrive in Shanghai during the day. We don't know if Donghua, who is returning to the country, will have a good opportunity to meet with them. Our corps has a major mission and needs the guidance of all comrades in many places. We sincerely hope that you will use your patriotic enthusiasm to give us guidance so that we can prepare. This time, the football team came to Shanghai, and we are grateful to our corps advisor Mr. Wang Xiaolai and all the comrades in the press for their help. We would like to express our sincere gratitude.</p>

<p>Starting Problem</p>
<h3 id="e246">Should Not Accommodate Foreigners <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>There are two starters for this competition, one is the American Hall and the other is our Chinese Jiang Xiangqing. All participating countries requested that the starting commands be given according to the rules of the United States and Britain, that is, the gun is fired immediately after the ready command, without the commands of "On your marks," "Set," and a two-second delay before firing. Shen Siliang, the general secretary of the Athletic Association, has agreed to use the rules of the United States and Britain, otherwise, foreigners will suffer too much. However, if the rules of the United States and Britain are used, our Chinese athletes will inevitably be greatly restricted. Shen Siliang specifically instructed Jiang Xiangqing to contact Hall to discuss how the two should cooperate. However, Mr. Jiang has not yet met Hall and needs to discuss it further after arriving at the venue today. According to the international rules of track and field, the starting commands should be given in the language of the country where the games are held. At the previous Far Eastern Games held in Japan, all starting commands were given in Japanese. Therefore, according to international rules, the starting commands at the Shanghai All Nations Games should be given in our Chinese language. It is even more inappropriate to adopt the rules of the United States and Britain. Now that English is already being used, it is already a great accommodation. If we have to use the rules of the United States and Britain again, it would be too much of an accommodation to foreigners and a lack of self-respect. According to Jiang Xiangqing, there may be some disputes over the starting rules. If it is decided that the rules of the United States and Britain must be used, then Mr. Jiang will voluntarily give up and is unwilling to serve as the starter. It is hoped that our Chinese athletes will pay special attention.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Hopes of Various Countries <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The situation and hopes of the nine countries can be described as follows based on pre-event observations: (1) China: China's greatest advantage is the average talent level. Even if there is little hope of winning first place in each event, its position will definitely be higher than other countries. This year, there are many good players from various countries, and their strength will be dispersed. China has a better chance. There will definitely be positions in the short and long-distance races. The good players in the hurdles from the United States and Britain have already left Shanghai, so we can win steadily. In the two throws, there are Guan Wanyu and Leng Peigen. In the jumping events, Chen Ling, Gu Huo, and Wu Jinqi will not be disappointed.</p>
<p>(2) Britain: Britain's championship last year relied entirely on track events. Now, these good players have been transferred elsewhere. They were selected from Argar and Lancashire. In the short-distance races, Sheppard and Gregg are recommended. In the long-distance races, Kennatai is indeed a good player.</p>
<p>(3) America: America is China's greatest rival, but it is not at its peak this year. The good players are not improving, and the veterans are getting old. The most promising are: (1) Servis, who is a student at Oberlin College in the United States. His 800-meter record is exactly two minutes. He is participating in the 800-meter and 1500-meter races. (2) Yelashe, who is very good at short-distance running. (3) Laores, also a short-distance runner. (4) Hertesheng, a good javelin thrower, holds the meet record of 47.65 meters.</p>
<p>(4) Russia: There are many good players, but not many in number, and only one or two in the hurdles and short-distance races. There is little hope for championships, but the positions should be in the top three or four. Noteworthy are: (1) Tomoshevsky, 100 meters in 11.5 seconds, (2) Motovkin, steady first in the shot put, 12.72 meters, (3) Minolov in the discus throw, (4) Lotrenkov in the middle distance, and (5) Tatariev in the 10,000 meters.</p>
<p>(5) Germany: Not many in number, but the football star of West, Pike, is the leader. Pike was selected as a German Olympic representative but did not attend. He is particularly good at the shot put. There is also Krammer's discus, which will definitely have a position.</p>
<p>(6) The Japanese are not many, but they are all ruthless generals. Mr. Oka is the leader. He attended the Far Eastern Games this time. His highest record in the 100 meters is 10.8 seconds, which is worthy of attention. The next is Komatsu's triple jump, Furukawa's high jump and javelin. It is said that there are also good players in the hurdles. Let's wait and see.</p>
<p>(7) The French, Jewish, and Latvian representatives are all from the stationed troops in Shanghai. Their results are unknown. Jewish and Latvia each have only one person and are not very important. (8) The women's championship is likely to be won by Britain and America, with America having a higher chance. Bernat's high jump of 1.39 meters is unmatched. Her four-meter loss to Zhuang Mingzhen. Britain's Thompson will definitely win two short-distance events. Her 13.2-second 100 meters is unmatched by China. It is hoped that the heroines of China will work hard to excel.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Scoring Method <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The team scores include men's and women's championships. In each event, the top four are recorded. The scoring method uses a 5-3-2-1 system. The relay is doubled. The team with the most points wins the overall championship. Track and field events are not separated. Individual scores are not counted.</p>
<p>The executive committee of the congress previously decided that the first place will be awarded a silver cup, with a value not exceeding 20 yuan. The second, third, and fourth places will be awarded commemorative medals. It has now been decided that, to encourage participation, the second place will also be awarded a small silver cup.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Conference News <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Releasing Pigeons: This time, the News Daily will release more than 60 pigeons with colored ribbons tied to their feet during the opening ceremony to create a grand spectacle and express the meaning of peace. This is often an innovation in our country and adds color to the conference.</p>
<p>Military Music Broadcast: The conference site's announcements will be broadcast by the [Standard] and [Wheeler] companies' broadcasting machines, and the US military Mack Lin's military band will come to the site to play, adding interest. The order of the conference site will be maintained by the Guanghua Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Notice to Team Members: Members of the Chinese team must gather in the basketball room at 11:00 AM to distribute number cloths and uniforms. All conference staff and athletes are requested to arrive at the site at 1:15 PM to prepare to participate in the opening ceremony and parade (scheduled to be held at 1:30 PM). To ensure uniformity in the venue, all staff should preferably wear dark-colored tops and white trousers.</p>
<p>Visiting Routes: Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and six jiao. One-yuan tickets enter the venue from the Zhaobang Road entrance, and six-jiao tickets enter the venue from the west side of the basketball room at the Maron Road entrance.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Banning Street Guiding <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>A country is an enlarged family, and family scandals should not be publicized, let alone national scandals.</p>
<p>I have seen travelogues about China written by Westerners, which often contain insulting portrayals of our country; or, a photograph of a woman with unbound feet; or, a photograph of an opium smoker holding a pipe; and other unsightly phenomena are vividly depicted in the illustrations, truly ruining China's reputation. Recently, movies have become popular, and foreign film studios often screen movies that insult our country, exposing as much of China's dark society as possible. Patriots naturally feel heartbroken and angry when they see this. But where do these strange phenomena come from? It is due to the unpatriotic Chinese who guide foreigners around the streets.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has recently banned people who specialize in street guiding. Because foreigners come to this city for sightseeing, they often use people familiar with the routes as guides, called "street guides." These street guides lead foreigners to brothels, gambling dens, and various other low-class places, allowing them to take photos at will, which are then taken overseas and displayed and screened in public places, greatly insulting the national image. The Social Affairs Bureau's ban measures are divided into four types: (1) Chinese street guides must register before being allowed to practice. (2) When guiding foreigners on tours, they must first report the locations they will be visiting that day to the bureau and obtain a permit before touring. (3) The bureau may inspect street guide licenses and permits at any time. (4) Those who violate this will not be allowed to guide foreigners.</p>
<p>Street guiding does need to be banned, but can a mere official document eliminate the accumulated malpractices of the past? Furthermore, if street guides comply with the Social Affairs Bureau's regulations and obtain registration licenses and permits, but still lead foreigners to visit the dark underbelly of society, what methods will the Social Affairs Bureau use to intervene?</p>
<p>The lure of money can cause people to lose their sense of shame; street guiding alone shows the lack of moral education. Alas! This is a fundamental problem.</p>
<h3 id="e254">The Flavor of the Window <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>These windows are simply as small as a hole. Wherever stations, theaters, companies, institutions, and money exchanges exist, there's always such a small window. Every day, thousands and millions of people come to savor the flavor of these windows.</p>
<p>As for me, I need money every month: I like to watch the hustle and bustle in my leisure time, and I sometimes go out for travel, so I've savored the flavor of these windows quite a bit. When people ask me how it tastes, I say: Sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, every flavor is present.</p>
<p>The bank's window is the most difficult to taste; especially for us proletariat. Several staff members, because they are in contact with money all day long, and money can communicate with the gods, we respectfully call them "sir." The face of a pawnshop employee: the tone of a refrigerator, which is unbearable. In recent years, I have suffered even more, because the place where I work always uses a foreign bank check to replace cash every month. That is not only troublesome: all kinds of inequalities make your stomach burst. Because people wearing Chinese clothes have another window. The check is handed in, you are questioned as if you are being interrogated, then you are given a copper plate and told to wait. Waiting for half an hour or an hour is not a big deal. When the money arrives, it is reviewed again, and then handed to you. Westerners and those wearing Western clothes are at another window. They hand in the check, the staff looks at it, and takes out the money. From beginning to end, it takes only a few minutes. Foreign banks ultimately have a hard brand, full of this unequal atmosphere.</p>
<p>The windows of movie theaters and amusement parks, although they cost money, are somewhat sweet. Because you get a ticket, and there is a lot of excitement for you to watch, but sometimes business is too good, and it will also make you uncomfortable. Our people in this country have never been particular about small courtesies, and they are strong when they start first, you squeeze me, and sometimes they are squeezed so hard that they can't breathe. Clothes are torn: shoes are trampled off, which is a common thing.</p>
<p>The window of the station is full of joy and comfort; and sometimes there is some sourness. Because the traveler takes a ticket at the window, he can travel thousands of miles a day, travel and enjoy the scenery, which is pleasant. The person returning home takes a ticket and sends you quickly back to your hometown to talk about the past with family and relatives, isn't it comforting! However, some people seek food in other places, parents send their children: a delicate wife sends her husband, it's like saying goodbye at Yangguan, and inevitably shed tears!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the window of the accounting office of this newspaper. Every time the manuscript fees are settled, many pen-wielding comrades stand outside the window. You have a note, and I have stacks of receipts. This small amount, although it is said that drinking does not get you drunk, and eating does not fill you up. | Except for those with special contracts, this refers to our general sporadic contributors. | But the crystallization of hard work is also worth cherishing. The second is the two accounting gentlemen: one young man is flipping through the books, checking the seals: one old man is dialing the abacus, calculating the remuneration. They are also very harmonious and sincere. There is absolutely no face like a pawnshop employee, or the airs of bank employees, which is also something we should be grateful for.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Marriage Agency <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Flower Bell</p>
<p>There are already several Japanese private male and female matchmaking agencies. On June 1, the Tokyo Municipal Government's [Marriage Consultation Center] also officially opened. Lonely men and women, if there is a need, just go to the [Marriage Consultation Center] to consult, and then a red thread can be tied under their feet, each getting what they want, and working hard to produce small citizens, isn't that wonderful.</p>
<p>We Chinese are the smartest, and we will learn the tricks of male and female affairs as soon as we learn them. Look, [free love] is so energetic? Going to court for divorce is even more modern. [Trial marriages], which are transactions first and then auspicious openings, have also become more concrete recently. So according to our prediction, on × year × month × day, our Chinese [marriage agency] will definitely be ready, and will be on the covers of various newspapers, with large advertisements, respectfully preparing happy cakes and tea, inviting playboys and famous ladies to come together and celebrate.</p>
<p>We dare not brag about the situation in foreign countries. In our China, we can see it clearly at a glance. On the male side, the ads of [having a considerable occupation, with a good monthly income, seeking a lifelong companion] are not very reliable. If you find the opponent rashly, you will have to eat the lawsuit of [under the age of sixteen, treated as rape]. On the female side, neither high nor low matches, and they become old maids in vain, and their minds are on their feet. It is also improper to stuff the horoscope in people's sleeves. If you randomly arrange a marriage, you are afraid that [there is already a first wife at home]. Left is difficult, right is also inappropriate, so the holding of this [marriage agency] is indeed an urgent task at present, and it cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>This ideal agency is best opened next door to the court. Then, once men and women divorce, they can immediately register at the agency, which is a very good business. But when speaking into the mouth of a Chinese, it is said that it will become bad. If this kind of agency is called a [pimping company], it will be terrible.</p>

<p>— Qing Rang</p>
<p>Competing to say to see the mirage. Suddenly in the tower, nowhere to be found. Pavilions and palaces at the highest level. As if in the vast, cloudless road. What world are the aquatic plants in the water? Coming and going ships, sails open, wind cannons, if you can count. I want to actually find this strange scene. Suddenly, when I raise my eyes, it disappears. Could it be the weak water that sinks the boat, and feathers cannot cross? It is a direct ascent to the sky, only lacking a tired traveler to ride. Even if the Emperor has transcended the dust for eighty thousand kalpas. The startled car and phoenix carriage are difficult to stop. Not to mention that the human world toils in vain to wait for noise and avoidance. Laughing at the general distant look, wondering, strangely floating and obscuring. You must know that there are hundreds of Qionglou Jade Palaces in the sky. Where does the Jade Infant and Taizhen suddenly fall at the end? Even if you step on ten continents and three islands to search everywhere. Where can you find the cloud axes and moon chisels? If you ask who lives outside the nine heavens. In the hidden gold and green buildings, you can hear the jade flutes. The glazed palace sees ten thousand layers in the clouds. Turning around in an instant, the white dog has disappeared. Alas! Do not say that the earth is in vain. The Qingdao scenery also urges change. Try to see Jiqi coming to reflect each other. Fearing to be late, scrambling, as if drunk.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Frustrated words spur a young man to resign and retreat</p>
<p>A warm heart pities a young girl, bringing floss in person</p>
<p>Ji Zhi said: Last time we talked in the milk tea shop, I already told you a lot. Do you still not understand? Gui Zhi said: I understand, you're afraid of offending your brother. If you offend your brother, things won't be reliable. It's not that I'm looking down on Second Master, but if you're always relying on your brother for food like this, afraid to make any decisions yourself, then you might as well just break off all relations with me. Because if you didn't have your brother, you wouldn't have food to eat, so how could you talk about anything else? Don't think that just because you're a Second Master, you're so much higher in status than us. Even though we're not successful, we still rely on our own ten fingers to make a living. If we were like you, depending on one person, it's not certain that we wouldn't be able to rely on them, and we would have gotten rich a long time ago. Hmph, you look down on me, but I look down on you even more! This barrage of sarcasm made Ji Zhi's face turn red with shame, and he couldn't say a word. Gui Zhi sneered: You don't have anything to say, do you? You can save that nonsense about waiting three years for me to deceive others. I don't want to hear it. I specifically came to find you today to give you a reply. Having said that, Gui Zhi didn't wait for his answer and left. Ji Zhi stood in the middle of the road, staring at Gui Zhi's retreating figure, feeling that the back of his head had stiffened, which was an expression of extreme anger. He thought to himself that since he had met her, he had never heard her speak so severely. Today, to use such words to criticize him, she was definitely extremely angry. However, what she said wasn't too much; he was indeed relying on his brother to live, a parasite on his brother. It was right for her to look down on him. But then again, if someone who thought highly of him still looked down on him like this, then the opinions of others about him were imaginable. He absolutely could not accept it calmly and let people look down on him like that. He must exert himself and achieve something for people to see. He thought like this all the way to the yamen, and naturally, he was full of spirit when handling affairs. Hou Zhi saw this, but called him to the bureau chief's office and taught him a lesson to his face, saying: This is the yamen, not home. Those who draw a salary here must be spirited and do their work. If there are people who just write their attendance and loaf around here, I have no use for them. Whoever does that, get out of here.

<h3 id="e258">Financial Gold Standard Fluctuates Extremely Rapidly <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>– Initially Fell Due to Negative Overseas News –</p>
<p>– Subsequently Rose Again Due to Tightening Exchange Market and Intense Short Covering –</p>
<p>Although the gold market yesterday did not see fire-like volatility, the situation was extremely confusing and the changes were extremely rapid. In the early morning, due to the simultaneous decline in overseas silver markets, the forward silver price on the Gold and Silver Exchange rose by more than one point. Stocks had already rebounded by nearly one yuan. In addition, Reuters reported that the US representative in the economic conference had spoken on the ship about reducing cash reserves and increasing the use of silver. The market fell immediately after opening. Later, due to banks buying more than selling, the situation stabilized and rose slightly. When it was learned in advance that HSBC's listed British pound rose by 0.25 and the US dollar rose by 0.375, the downward trend was stronger. Later, it rose and fell with the exchange market and public sentiment, drifting uncertainly. Near the midday close, there was a big wave. First, it fell because the exchange market seemed to be hardening, but it failed to break the 30-yuan mark. At this time, the Guangdong banking group slightly bought US dollars, and many took the opportunity to hedge. For a time, rumors spread that the Guangdong banking group was aggressively buying and short sellers were disturbing themselves, striving to cover their positions, causing a rebound of more than ten yuan. The market was calm afterwards. The Bombay market initially rose by three annas and then fell by one anna. The activity of hot money going out increased the price to 62.3 yuan. The swap spread for June/July was from 12.7 yuan to 13 yuan. The market situation for today is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 933.8 yuan, a drop of 9.3 yuan compared to the previous close. The premium opening was 3.5 yuan. The exchange market also opened loose, with the recent selling price being 1 shilling 3 pence 0.125 for British pounds and 25.25 yuan for US dollars. The news was unfavorable, and public sentiment seemed to be weakening. However, because Banque Belge and others were all buying September US dollars at 26 yuan, Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Xing, Yi Feng Yong, and Da De Cheng all bought, so it rose from 3 yuan to 6.5 yuan. When it was learned in advance that HSBC's listed British pound rose by 0.25 and the US dollar rose by 0.375, the sellers were excited. Zhao Feng Chang, Fu Yu, and Heng Yu vigorously sold, so it fell to 0.5 yuan. Yuan Mao and Ri Chang advanced aggressively and were pulled up. Zheng Chang, Fu Chang, Yi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Fu, and Zhao Feng Chang jointly submitted bids. September US dollars at 26 yuan were difficult to settle, so it reached 7.2 yuan. Although the listing was long, it was not taken to heart. Banks were buying more actively, and the spot price fell with the bids. HSBC bought September 26 yuan, and Fu Chang and Zhi Feng Yong came to bid, so it still rose. After entering, it was once loose and excessive. September US dollars at 26 yuan were difficult to sell. Yuan Mao continuously unloaded, and Heng Yu also sold, retreating to within 4 yuan. Hong Li and Tian Feng Yong entered bids and stabilized slightly. When there were still no sellers at 0.0625 for September, Fu Yu, Da Xing Yong, Rui Kang, and Zhao Feng all offered, Cheng Feng Yong wanted 0.0625 for September US dollars and 0.08125 for August but did not get it, so it fell to 30.02 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the last ten minutes, a surprise force emerged. Banque Belge initially submitted a bid of 0.0125 for September, and the Guangzhou banking group bought 0.0625 for July. Tian Feng Yong and Yuan Heng advanced to outside 3 yuan. Da Tong and HSBC bought back 0.0125 for September US dollars. MacKay even submitted a bid of 0.0625 for the same month. The Guangzhou banking group aggressively bought, and public sentiment turned firm. Tong Yi, Heng Xing, and Heng Yu came to buy bids, so it leaped to rise, and since it was difficult to settle half a yuan for July US dollars, the midday close was 939 yuan. After the close, Yong Feng, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Sheng Yong, and Tian Feng Yong and others frantically bought, and it rose to 43-44 yuan, so the spot price was auctioned at 44 yuan. Also, because HSBC squeezed out 0.0875 for September US dollars, it retreated to around 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 943.5 yuan, and the spot opened at the same price. The Bank of East Asia squeezed out 0.0875 for September US dollars, and Fu Yu sold bids, so it retreated from 3.8 yuan to within 2 yuan. Banque Belge even offered 0.06875 for August US dollars. Heng Xing sold to 0.05 yuan. Fu Chang and others slightly bid, but because banks were doing business for the current month at 0.03125 US dollars, Pan Gen squeezed out 0.09375 for September, Qing Fa Yong sold bids, and it still dropped from 2.4 yuan to 40 yuan. Bing Xing, Da Xing Yong, and Heng Yu only bought, and it continued to rise. Before long, Bombay telegraphed that it fell three annas and rose to 3 yuan. Heng Xing sold bids and Zhong Fu also offered 0.06875 for August US dollars, retreating to 1.2 yuan. Public sentiment was still stable and could still support it, because MacKay would bid 0.0875 for September US dollars. When the silver company sold 0.09375 for September US dollars, Bombay rebounded one anna, Yuan Kang Xiang, Yuan Mao, and others all unloaded, and for a time retail investors acted fiercely, and it fell to 39 yuan. Heng Xing and Bing Xing still entered, and the closing was 940.8 yuan, and the spot was auctioned at the same price. It was found that the highest price of the day was 943.8 yuan and the lowest was 930.02 yuan, with a fluctuation of 13.6 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 2.3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The revealed price was 24.875 yuan because HSBC's US dollar listing rose by 0.375. The alloy price was 964.82 yuan, which, according to the closing price, was about 24 yuan, a decrease of more than 12 yuan compared to the previous close. The account price for the current month was 952 yuan, and for July was 939 yuan. The water replenishment was 952 yuan in the morning and 954 yuan in the afternoon. The hot money price was 62 yuan, slightly more expensive than the previous day. Transactions were rare because the inventory of each spot firm had been absorbed by small money houses, and the activity of hot money going out increased the price. The swap price for June/July was 13 yuan, with Qian Chang Xiang offering 105 bids to Heng Tai, and Da Feng Heng offering 35 bids to Heng Tai, Qian Chang Xiang offering 91 bids to Hui Xiang, all at 12.7 yuan. Heng Xing transferred 14 June bids to Tong Feng Heng at a price of 50 yuan. There were still 5,075 June bids remaining.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was not active, and the situation was uncertain. In summary, Heng Xing, Tai De Cheng, Ri Chang, Yi Feng Yong, Tian Feng Yong, Hong Li, Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Tong Yi, Yong Feng, Yuan Sheng Yong, Shun Li, Bing Xing, etc. all advanced. Yuan Mao, Wan Xing, Da Xing Yong, Rui Kang, Fu Yu, Yuan Kang Xiang, Yuan Chun, etc. all sold. Heng Yu and Ri Chang, etc. sold first and then advanced. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Heng, etc. advanced first and then sold. The Dalian gang Shun Li squeezed in, while Wan Xing sold out. The Guangzhou gang Heng Xing advanced by about 400-500 bids, including 24,808 July chips transferred by Shen Kang.</p>

<p>The Market Mostly Slightly Weaker After Closing</p>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange market, because the Sino-Japanese ceasefire was no longer a problem, the withdrawal of Japanese troops had also been realized, and all parties could understand each other. However, the price had risen for three consecutive days, and the arrival of a reversal had to be carefully considered. Although the market continued to rise yesterday, from 0.1-0.2 to 0.5 yuan, its trend was already showing weakness. In the morning's first session, each group bought in, and number 38 slightly covered shorts, and the price was slightly better by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The second session was quite sluggish, with gains and losses of only 0.1-0.2 yuan. In the afternoon's opening, number 50 covered shorts, and the northern group also had needs, and it continued to rise by 0.2-0.3 yuan. At the close, each bond market was slightly weak, slightly smaller by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Only the forward salt tax rose by 0.2 yuan because number 50 continued to buy. As a result, it was estimated to have risen by 0.3-0.5 yuan, which was not as strong as the previous day. Whether the future of the current situation is still changing is difficult to grasp. It's just that the market price is already high, and it is inevitable to attract large-scale selling from major players. For example, the disarmament bond of 58 yuan discovered a new high price this year, but the salt tax has not yet broken through the highest price of 45 yuan. The hearts of the people are revealed here. Yesterday's total transaction volume was estimated at 9,161,000 yuan, of which 6,000 yuan was spot, and the futures unified salt tax accounted for 3,440,000, the disarmament bond accounted for 1,370,000, the 1921 Customs Tax accounted for 1,035,000, the 2022 Customs Tax accounted for 1,935,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 3-400,000.</p>

<p>＝More Bullish Sentiment Prevalent＝</p>
<p>The yarn market turned to a rising trend again, and the situation was relatively firm. However, the actual demand was flat. However, because the raw cotton inventory was low and thin, the market sentiment was relatively high, which caused the yarn market, which was dependent on it, to rise as well. Moreover, there were speculators buying in, so the market price was slightly higher, and buyers flocked in. The future situation was difficult to grasp.</p>

<p>The rising trend in the cotton market is becoming more intense. Foreign cotton has fallen slightly, and the gold price has rebounded, causing the sentiment of buyers to be active, and the situation is very tight. Moreover, general speculators believe that their inventory is scarce, and the foreign cotton exploration silver market is expensive, so it is not feasible to come to Shanghai. Therefore, they are very bullish, so the rising trend is more intense than the second market.</p>

<p>(Shaoxing Cocoon Merchants Preparing to Cease Purchases) New cocoons from the four rural districts have been on the market for many days. Cocoon merchants have been weighing purchases for two weeks. This year's cocoon production is not abundant, and it is difficult for each merchant to reach their full quota. Recently, the amount of goods arriving on the market has gradually decreased, and preparations are being made to cease purchases. Cocoon prices have been as high as forty-nine yuan and as low as twenty-five or twenty-six yuan. (Anji Cocoon Production Only Reaches 20%) This spring, farmers have been limited in the amount of silkworms they raise due to economic hardship. The cocoon production of the entire county only reaches 20%. Cocoon merchants have been weighing purchases for many days, with dwindling numbers. Cocoon prices have been as high as thirty-five or thirty-six yuan, and native cocoons at twenty-four or twenty-five yuan.</p>
<p>(Haiyan Cocoon Merchants Insufficient Purchases) New cocoons have been on the market for many days. This year, silkworm farmers' feeding quotas are not strong. Cocoon production is only 30% of a normal year. Silkworm rearing costs are not cheap, and cocoon prices are not high, so many silkworm farmers are reeling their own local silk. Each merchant's purchases are insufficient. Improved varieties of cocoons are priced as high as thirty-seven or thirty-eight yuan to forty-four or forty-five yuan, and native varieties are as high as twenty-seven or twenty-eight yuan to thirty-two or thirty-three yuan.</p>
<p>(Yixing Premium Cocoons Open at High Prices) Cocoon production in various towns and villages this year is still good. Improved varieties are considered superior. Cocoon merchants have been weighing purchases for four or five days, and each merchant is competing to purchase cocoons. Premium cocoons of improved varieties have surged to forty-four yuan to fifty-five yuan, and native cocoons are at twenty-seven or twenty-eight yuan to thirty-four or thirty-five yuan.</p>
<p>(Wuxi New Cocoon Production Abundant, Quality Excellent) This year, those raising improved varieties in the four rural districts account for 80%, and there are instructors assisting in the process. The harvest is relatively good, and the cocoon quality is also excellent. Therefore, a small number of cocoon merchants violated the public agreement and started weighing purchases two or three days early, indiscriminately raising cocoon prices and competing to purchase premium cocoons. After the local Public Security Bureau ordered them to cease purchases, all resumed weighing purchases on June 1st. The initial cocoon price for improved varieties was thirty-four or thirty-five yuan, but yesterday it had already risen to fifty-four or fifty-five yuan. Native cocoons are at twenty-five or twenty-six yuan to twenty-eight or twenty-nine yuan. (Zhejiang Dried Cocoons Trial Reeling Results in Losses) Due to the cold spring and frequent rains in various silkworm areas of Zhejiang Province this spring, early-season native varieties have been greatly affected. Late-season improved varieties are the best. New dried cocoons are continuously being transported to Shanghai. According to the results of trial reeling at various factories, approximately 500 catties of improved variety cocoons yield 100 catties of silk, while 670-680 catties of native variety cocoons are required. Cocoon costs are not cheap, and based on current silk prices, factories are incurring losses.</p>
<p>(Japanese Silk Prices Drop, Silk Sales Also Clear) With the prospect of the United States abolishing the gold standard and the loosening of foreign exchange, Japanese silk prices have risen. European and American firms in Shanghai have been making up for short positions and stockpiling yellow and white factory silk. The day before yesterday, silk price transactions surged, and prices also tended to rise. Yesterday, Yokohama Japanese silk only opened at 840 yen, a decrease of 20 yen. As a result, New York and Lyon silk prices also weakened. Silk telegrams were not forwarded, and the market cleared. Yesterday, only 130 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, 153 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, 30 bales of Shandong factory silk, and 2 bales of yellow coarse silk were traded. Prices were generally flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Wenzhou Needle-Eyebrow Tea Sales to Europe Still Smooth <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wenzhou-sourced needle-eyebrow green tea saw intense interest from British merchant Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., with the entire city trading over 700 boxes. Remaining stocks are almost completely sold out, mainly due to low prices that suit the market. There were also sporadic transactions in needle-eyebrow pearl tea from Sui'an and Pingshui. However, precious-eyebrow green tea from Tunxi, Sui'an, Qianxian, and Wudong, as well as Qifu and Ningzhou black tea, all remained stagnant, with prices likely to fall rather than rise. Donggongxi green tea from Wuyuan opened yesterday at 107 yuan per head pan by the Baito firm Yu Long, but calculated in last year's silver currency, that is still down fourteen or fifteen yuan. As a result, Chinese tea merchants have sent out a large number of telegrams and are taking a more conservative approach to purchasing goods from the interior.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Tea Merchants Prevent Further Decline in Black Tea Prices <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>This year's Qimen, Fuliang, and other black teas came on the market with an initial opening price that was already one-third lower than last year. Unexpectedly, British firms' sales appetite was not strong, and Chinese tea merchants competed to sell at low prices, leading to repeated and unlimited price drops. Based on the current market estimates, prices have fallen another 30% since the opening, resulting in losses of no less than sixty or seventy yuan per dan for the hao firms. Given this situation and the potentially dire future prospects, the foreign firms' Tea Industry Association held a joint meeting of warehouse firms and hao firms the other day to discuss ways to prevent further price declines. It was agreed that prices should not fall below a certain minimum: Qimen tea, first batch 120 yuan, second batch 85 yuan, third batch 70 yuan; Fuliang tea, first batch 100 yuan, second batch 80 yuan, third batch 65 yuan; Qiupu tea, first batch 85 yuan, second batch 75 yuan, third batch 60 yuan. The above proposals have already been notified to all tea warehouses for compliance in order to maintain the foundation of the tea industry.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Rice Market Stabilized <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of twenty or thirty small-scale rice merchants were still healthy, but the eating market was very tight, resulting in a stable situation. Out-of-town merchants from Tianjin and Weihaiwei purchased 1,000-odd bags of Bo rice, and the market stabilized. Prices of Su, Tong, and South Port, Songjiang, and Qingpu rice were neither rising nor falling. Du Yang pointed rice also stabilized, with no change in the shadow price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of twenty-one or twenty-two rice from various areas downstream were weak. White Jing rice sales were light, and the market situation was flat and weak. Medium-grade and lower-grade rice were selling in small quantities nearby. Bo rice arrivals were few, sales were flat, and prices were slightly soft. Yang Du and Bu pointed rice arrivals were not strong, and scattered sales were transacted, with a steady market situation. Out-of-town pointed rice prices were neither rising nor falling. Early rice prices were high, with medium-grade and lower-grade rice appearing weak. White Yuan rice prices were flat.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Forward Flour Prices Increasingly Strong <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>│Tianjin and Shandong Merchants Both Absorbing│</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed initial flatness followed by increasing strength in the morning session. With wheat prices from overseas down slightly by one or two jiao, the market sentiment was initially not good. However, factories showed little willingness to sell, as the prospects for new wheat are still uncertain. Recently, imported wheat has also not been cost-effective, so in each market, the forward trend gradually improved. By the afternoon session, the forward market sentiment was even stronger, as the difference between near-term and forward prices was very large, and spread trades were active. At the same time, merchants from Tianjin and Shandong frequently bought forward contracts, leading to a gradual rise in forward prices. This situation is quite justified in the absence of competition from imported wheat. Whether there will be changes after the new wheat arrives will depend on the factories' sales. As a result, the current month was up five li compared to the previous day, July was up one and a half fen, August and September were up one and seven and a half li, October was up one and two and a half li, and November was up one and seven and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e277">New Wheat Enters the Market, Futures Prices Fall Slightly <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market presented a flat and weak picture. With foreign wheat prices down one or two jiao and the weather turning sunny and smooth, harvesting has already begun in several places in the Jiangnan region. In the Jiangbei region, it will also be available in about a week. Given this favorable weather, the market sentiment suddenly weakened, and the selling pressure from inland merchants increased. The estimated price for new wheat for delivery in Jiangnan is around four yuan (per shi), and the estimated price in Wuxi is four yuan and five jiao. With both new supplies and arrivals strong, there may be discrepancies when factory demand is weak. As a result, July fell two fen compared to the previous day, August fell one fen, September fell two fen, and October initially fell slightly by three fen, but later recovered by three fen.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Ningbo New Broad Beans Open at 5.8 Yuan <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>New broad beans have already come on the market in various producing areas. The reason for their lackluster sales is that the outgoing route is ordinary, leading to a general apathy among merchants. Purchases may only be triggered when goods flood the market and prices are low. Yesterday, 50 bags of Ningbo-broken broad beans, whose quality was quite good, were transported to the market. The Tianjin merchants opened the bidding price at 5.8 yuan. There are 1,600-odd bags of Wenzhou broad beans arriving today, and it is feared that their prices will be difficult to reach the original levels.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e279">Coarse and White Sugar Markets Appear Weak <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in the auction price, while the Dutch exchange rate rose, leading to flat and weak sentiment among brokers. The association's benchmark price for #24 coarse white sugar of ordinary quality for delivery was 20.35 yuan, but incoming bids were only 2.25 jiao higher, resulting in no transactions. Neither #20 medium white sugar nor #8 and #9 Dutch red sugar were benchmarked. Changxing Firm benchmarked Guanghua Factory's Lu brand at 20.07 yuan, Shou brand at 20.01 yuan, ground sugar plus Guangbao at 20.085 yuan, RA cotton Dutch white at 21.6 yuan, and Dagu Che brand white B mark at 21.75 yuan. Zhenji #1 cotton white bid at 19.9 yuan. The hao pan only had Chaoshan belt, with 200-odd packages, priced at 12.5 to 12.2 jiao. Zhangdiao Qinghao inventory is already scarce, and subsequent arrivals are lacking. Yesterday, market firms still bid no higher than 12 yuan, and because the customer did not agree, they still planned to wait for a good price.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e280">White Habit and Straight Tribute Both Selling Well <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>(White Habit) The #1, #2, and #3 goods are all selling well. They are used for Western-style suits and women's overcoats. The Yi Ji Dao Xiancao brand is the most popular. The open wholesale price is 5.05 to 6 yuan. Thick white habit sales are also strong. Tailors in Shanghai have been settling on cloth for days. (White Straight Tribute) Sales are stronger than willow pattern. Because willow pattern straight tribute is only used for trouser material, pure white and plain blue tribute wool are arriving in larger quantities than willow pattern. Yesterday, good Hua white straight tribute wool was offered for sale at 7 yuan, Lin Nan at 6.1 yuan, and Han Ping at 4.75 yuan.</p>

<p>According to a New York telegram from the 2nd, Canadian pig lead is selling at US$52 per ton, up another $2 from the previous day. The standard in the local market has also increased by 0.2 jiao, and each dan can be sold for as high as 15.8 yuan. There are also many in the industry bidding at 16 yuan. Aside from a few transactions from factories, there were no large-scale transactions, making the market picture very lonely.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Tianjin Merchants Begin Purchasing Hardware <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Since the cessation of hostilities in the north, the Tianjin market has become more active. Local Tianjin merchants have also been receiving telegrams from head offices to purchase hardware. Therefore, there were many negotiations in the market yesterday. Although the number of transactions was not high, there is still optimism about the future. In total, several dozen types of goods were purchased, including white oak leather, galvanized iron sheets, tinplate, new lead wire, green iron wire mesh, English iron plates, pig lead, new foreign coins, two-skin iron, and bamboo-joint steel. Because there were no green onions for contract orders, the opening market was slightly up and down. As for business in Beiping and Zhangjiakou, it is still at a standstill, while business in Qingdao, Yantai, and Jinan remains ordinary.</p>

<h3 id="e283">We Need a Chekhov <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>Among the literary writers of past Russia, I greatly admired Chekhov. Because from his pen, he left us countless silhouettes of the intellectual class of Russia at that time—those alienated, numb, neurotic, and nihilistic intellectuals spouting brilliant theories in various settings.</p>
<p>There are more such intellectuals in present-day China than in Chekhov's Russia. However, we do not have a writer like Chekhov, so no one is leaving us portraits of these intellectuals.</p>
<p>Let me give an example now: The other day, a certain dance hall held a ×× Save the Nation cum Celebrate the Movie Queen convention. Naturally, there had to be many celebrities to call for or support the event. But the so-called celebrities were either bureaucratic intellectuals or capitalist intellectuals. Then, a round-headed gentleman came out to give a speech. The gist of his speech was: [Today we are holding this grand ×× Dance to Save the Nation convention. One reason is to celebrate the election of Ms. ×× as Movie Queen, and the second is to promote the ideology of ×× saving the nation...] (Next, he spoke a great deal about the theory of ×× saving the nation.)</p>
<p>But how can dancing save the nation? This eloquent gentleman then gave a personal example and continued to speak: [Gentlemen, in various dance halls, you can often see me (According to those with dancing experience, this gentleman goes to several dance halls every night in rotation). But you don't know that I have another intention. Recently, young people in general are obsessed with Westernization and like to wear Western clothes. But when I go to dance halls, I wear a Chinese-made long gown. So my dancing is not for entertainment. I want to promote patriotism with the long-gown ideology in this most fashionable place...]</p>
<p>[Gentlemen,] I would like to continue what this gentleman said: [Do you think this speech is ridiculous? But there are countless members of the Chinese intellectual class similar to this gentleman. They are spouting brilliant theories everywhere. Are their actions and words not worth recording and leaving for our descendants to see? Therefore, how should we expect to see a writer like Chekhov emerge soon to do this work for us!]</p>
<h3 id="e284">The Fourth Type of Person <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Suppose the first type of person is left, the second type of person is right, and the third type of person is neither left nor right (the meaning of the third type of person actually contains a certain degree of left-leaning, but he is still a considerable distance away from "fellow travelers"). Then there is also a fourth type of person. This fourth type of person is both left and right, and can be left or right.</p>
<p>If you ask whether there are currently such people in the literary world who are both left and right, the answer is yes, and in considerable numbers.</p>
<p>The fourth type of person is naturally much more intelligent than the third type of person. The third type of person is actually a fool. The fourth type of person is truly intelligent. They have a skill: they speak human language to humans and ghost language to ghosts. When someone exposes them, they can say: [You don't know. This is strategy. This is for some necessity.] Therefore, there is no way to verify, and both sides consider him one of their own.</p>
<p>The fourth type of person is the pride of the times, because the current era does not allow you to stand on one side alone. Being able to be left and right, able to be left or right, and both left and right, means that both you and I pull him in, and in the meantime, he calmly builds his position and reaps double the benefits.</p>
<p>If we bestow the title of [fence-sitter] on the third type of person, then we can give the fourth type of person the badge of [two-facedness]. Comparing the two, we can know the inevitability of the superior defeating the inferior. A person sitting on the fence obviously has the danger of displeasing both sides. A person who is yin to yin and yang to yang can cater to each side's preferences, as long as they are careful not to mix up the yin and yang sides.</p>
<p>It is said that the fourth type of person is always victorious. I still have a great wish: I hope they will lead China, being both white and red, so that other countries cannot figure out our mysteries. With everyone treating us as comrades, China will naturally exist forever.</p>
<p>Some say that this fourth type of person is not new. They are worshiping bureaucracy as their elder, and are true old-brand opportunists. Whether this is true remains to be examined.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Mother <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Madam was really angry today, scolding her only daughter for the first time.</p>
<p>But the few words she scolded did not move her daughter's heart, but made herself cry. Her daughter is now nineteen years old. She had never scolded her before. Now that she had spoken, it was as if she had done something wrong to her daughter, and she felt so sad. So she cried.</p>
<p>Her daughter had only studied in Shanghai for a few months, and she had changed so quickly. Madam had seen a lot of the world. Although Shanghai is prosperous, many families send their children there. Although some become bad, there are also many who become good, like her cousin's two sons who are so good. One came back to be a lawyer and the other came back to be a doctor, and they did not learn anything bad. There are also bad ones, but Madam always said that they were bad by nature and had never blamed Shanghai for being too prosperous. Now, Shanghai had really spoiled her daughter, and she began to suspect that this place could really ruin people.</p>
<p>Her daughter dressed so beautifully that she did not look like a student at all. Her former innocent appearance was completely gone. She spoke without thinking and was always thinking about something. Her eyes seemed to have lost something, like a sleepwalker.</p>
<p>Last year, when the pomegranate flowers bloomed, everyone planned to go to Shanghai to study and said many great things. Madam thought that her daughter would become a successful female politician, female lawyer, or some kind of writer. This year, the pomegranate flowers at the foot of the rockery are blooming again, and Madam is very disappointed. Her daughter is gradually leaving herself and heading towards a dark abyss. The young girl is wearing such strange clothes and using so much makeup. Where is there any time left to do serious things?</p>
<p>[Mom, you are outdated. Young people always like this.]</p>
<p>These words really made Madam angry. Although she usually loved her, she could not help but scold her a few words.</p>
<p>But her daughter just smiled at her stubbornly. It was as if she did not see the tears flowing from Madam's eyes, and she hurriedly walked outside again.</p>
<h3 id="e286">A Quilt <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Taiwei</p>
<p>[Gui! I don't have a quilt. It's so cold. It's really uncomfortable under my clothes. I see you have two quilts on your bed. Could you lend me one to use temporarily?]</p>
<p>Yes, I originally had two quilts. But since receiving Wen's letter, there has been one less quilt on my bed. I am not a stingy person, and I am willing to share everything with my friends. But after I let Wen take a quilt, I felt a deep sense of regret.</p>
<p>I often think about that quilt. Its relationship with me is really too close. Although it is a very bad quilt, when I see it, I excitedly remember many unforgettable past events.</p>
<p>Since I left my hometown at the age of sixteen and wandered around, this quilt has been my closest friend. Whether it was in a humid and dark shack or on a chilly journey, I always kept it by my side.</p>
<p>I remember when I left home that year, my mother added many threads to the cotton wadding. While sewing, she said to me:</p>
<p>[Gui! Be careful in everything this time you go out. Just study hard. I don't want you to do anything else. Don't get involved in anything reckless. Your parents will be worried...] My mother said, you are a smart person, you know everything!</p>
<p>Now my mother is suffering at home, and I don't care about her at all. She gets up to work before dawn every day. And me? I am still wandering around from east to west and north to south, making my mother worry about me!</p>
<p>I only need to see the quilt, and I immediately think of my mother suffering at home.</p>
<p>Why did I let Wen take this quilt? It contains my mother's best teachings to me, embodying my mother's love, sorrow, and hope for me! I really hate myself!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a friend came over, looked at my bed, and asked me with a smile:</p>
<p>[Where's that quilt?]</p>
<p>[...] My heart was pierced, and I had nothing to say.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of my pale face and sad expression, my friend stopped talking about it.</p>
<p>That morning, that rascal came again. [Gui, I'm sorry, but I pawned the quilt you lent me. It was worth two yuan, which can at least help me through a few difficult days. I really had no choice but to do this. You shouldn't blame me, right! I heard you have two quilts. Can't I get one from you? You still have a blanket, right? I still hope you...]</p>
<p>What else does he hope I'll do? I threw the letter away, lay on the bed, and felt very angry.</p>
<p>[You have already taken away many of my precious memories. What else do you want? Do you want to take away even my soul?]</p>
<h3 id="e287">Carrot Top <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Jules Kenaro, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>This little house, which had been used in turn to raise chickens, rabbits, and pigs, was now empty and became Carrot Top's exclusive property during his holidays. The little house no longer had a door, so he could easily slip in. Some fragile weeds grew at the entrance, and Carrot Top lay on the ground looking at them as if they were a forest. The ground was covered with a layer of dust. The bricks on the four walls looked shiny because of the dampness. Carrot Top rubbed his hair on the roof. He felt as comfortable and at home there as in his own house. He disdained many toys, but he tried his best to fantasize. His main game was to dig a nest in every corner of the little house with his buttocks. He used his palms like a trowel to gather the dust into a circle and then flatten the ground.</p>
<p>With his back against the smooth wall, his legs folded, and his hands on his knees, Carrot Top felt very comfortable there. Indeed, he could not shrink the space he occupied any smaller. He forgot everything, and he was no longer afraid of anything. Only a sunny day would disturb him.</p>
<p>The water in the kitchen sink, released from the hole in the stone trough, flowed not far from him, sometimes rushing turbulently and sometimes trickling slowly, sending him waves of heat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he received an alarm.</p>
<p>The shouts gradually approached, and the sound of hurried footsteps could be heard.</p>
<p>[Carrot Top? Carrot Top?]</p>
<p>A head lowered, and Carrot Top curled up, pressed tightly against the earthen wall, held his breath, opened his mouth wide, and even his eyes went blank. He felt two eyes searching in the shadows.</p>
<p>[Carrot Top, are you in here?]</p>
<p>His temples swelled high, and he desperately held back. He was about to let out a painful cry. [He's not here, the little beast. Where on earth did that thing go?] The searcher walked away, and Carrot Top's body relaxed slightly, and he felt comfortable again.</p>
<p>His thoughts wandered in silence for a long time.</p>
<p>But suddenly, his ears were filled with a hubbub. A pair of bluebottle flies were trapped by a spider web on the roof, struggling with their wings. The spider slid down a thread. Its belly showed a yellowish-white color like breadcrumbs. It paused in mid-air, hesitant, letting the strand of silk it held rotate in the air.</p>
<p>Carrot Top raised his buttocks and peered anxiously. When the terrible spider leaped towards the enemy, sealed the web with its small feet, and grabbed the captured food, Carrot Top stood up excitedly, as if he wanted to share a cup of soup. But there was no further action.</p>
<p>The spider ran up again. Carrot Top sat down again, and he concentrated and calmed down, engaging in contemplation. After a while, his fantasy, like a stream of water filtered through sand, stopped and formed a pool of water, still and motionless, because there was no place for it to leak.</p>
<p>Glue</p>
<p>Carrot Top heard people say that for bait for carp, nothing is better than cat meat, not chicken, duck, or pig parts.</p>
<p>He knew a cat because it was old and sick, shedding hair everywhere. It was treated badly. Carrot Top invited it to his house, to the little house, to drink a cup of milk. There, no third party would participate. Or maybe a pair of mice would run out of the wall, but Carrot Top should give it a cup of milk. He put the cup of milk in a corner. He sent the cat to the corner and said:</p>
<p>[Eat as much as you want.]</p>
<p>He stroked its spine, giving it all kinds of gentle names, watching it lick the milk so deftly with its tongue, that he was moved:</p>
<p>[Poor old thing, eat up the rest.]</p>
<p>The cat finished all the milk, sweeping the bottom of the cup with its tongue, pointing at the edge of the cup, and then only its sweet-tasting lips remained. [Poor old beast, eat up the rest.]</p>
<p>The cat finished all the milk, sweeping the bottom of the cup with its tongue, pointing at the edge of the cup, and then only its sweet-tasting lips remained. [Are you done eating, all done?] Carrot Top asked, stroking it as before. [Of course, you must be very happy to have another cup; but I couldn't steal the first cup. And, whether sooner or later...] Saying this, he put the muzzle of the shotgun against the cat's forehead and fired. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e288">Tang Xiangming and Others Piously Recite Sutras <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a report in the newspaper that Tang Xiangming, Qu Yingguang, Fang Shengtao, Yang Shuzhuang, and others in Tianjin jointly invited a lama to recite sutras every morning from 5:00 AM to 7:00 or 8:00 AM, and kowtowed and knelt before the lama.</p>
<p>When I saw this telegram, a feeling suddenly arose in me. I originally opposed superstition and opposed vegetarianism and reciting Buddhist scriptures. Not only did I oppose them, but whenever I saw various superstitious actions such as vegetarianism and reciting Buddhist scriptures, I would scold them mercilessly, scolding them for being unconscious and for being "A-mu-lin." But thinking about it the other way around, it's not bad after all, so now that Tang Xiangming and others piously recite Buddhist scriptures, not only do I not oppose it, but I extremely support it.</p>
<p>Our Buddha is merciful and saves people from suffering, but the Buddha is ultimately otherworldly, not worldly, so he can only save the suffering of the afterlife, not the suffering of the present. If a person lives in the world and feels that it is tasteless and suffers many unspeakable kinds of pain, he feels that being human is meaningless, and he will think of "one Buddha appearing in the world, two Buddhas entering Nirvana." If this life is not good, he will cultivate a good afterlife; if this life is not comfortable, he will think of cultivating a comfortable afterlife. We have lived our lives to this point and can be considered extremely tasteless and extremely collapsed. There is no hope in this life, so we can only cultivate the afterlife. Truly [Amitabha].</p>
<p>But to cultivate, one must first set a goal. This question cannot help but make me consider it for a few days and set down the following principles. The first difficult question is whether it is better to be a human in the afterlife or not to be a human. If one is to be a human, what kind of person should one be? If one is not to be a human, what kind of animal should one be? The following points are the few standards I will assume for cultivation.</p>
<p>First, I want to cultivate to be a person with wealth and power. If I lose power and cannot live in the mainland, I will live in the concession as a comprador. If I don't live in a small apartment, I must live in a Western-style house. If I don't ride in a rickshaw, I must ride in a black-plated car. Assuming I can't live in the concession, I will run abroad and be a foreign comprador. If I can be such a person, it can be considered comfortable. So, I initially wanted to cultivate such a person, but after thinking about it carefully, it's not very appropriate after all; it doesn't look good on the surface. Therefore, I gave up and absolutely will not cultivate it.</p>
<p>Second, I want to cultivate to be a foreigner. But I don't want to be a foreigner from Egypt or India. I am determined to be a citizen of powerful countries such as England, the United States, Germany, and France. I can vent all the anger in my chest, but the people of weak countries have the difficulties of weak countries, and the people of strong countries also have the embarrassment of strong countries. There is often infighting, and you suspect and are jealous of me. In this situation of maneuvering and conspiring, there are also some unspeakable secrets. Being a foreigner may not necessarily be happy, so I also refuse to cultivate it.</p>
<p>Third, I don't want to cultivate to be a human, because being a human always has a brain and has consciousness. If you have a brain and have consciousness, there are always places where you don't feel comfortable, so I am determined not to be a human in the afterlife, just to be a dog.</p>
<p>And I don't want to be a Chinese dog; I must be a foreign dog, because being a Chinese is not comfortable, and being a Chinese dog is naturally even more uncomfortable. I don't want to do it. If I am a foreign dog, squatting by the side of foreign masters and foreign ladies every day, wagging my tail and looking mighty, how happy would that be! So, I am determined to cultivate to be a foreign dog in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Namo Amitabha...</p>

<p>[To transform from such an exciting life into this miserable street-sweeping labor, half of it can be attributed to the Japanese soldiers, but the other half can only be said that one's own fate is really too bitter, and also that one is getting old. But, rather than muddling along vaguely in a [riddle], it's better to simply suffer and eat bitterness! |]</p>
<p>A street sweeper in his fifties, hunched over, with gray hair, slowly swept the street while constantly wiping the sweat from his forehead. If he went back ten years, he wouldn't sweat much. Even if he did, he would often let the drops slide down his nose and into his mouth, and a lick with his tongue would only give him a salty taste like drinking salt water. Now, however, he didn't know why bitterness had been added to the saltiness, so he had to wipe it off handful by handful.</p>
<p>As soon as the red light at the intersection turned on, ant-like cars roared into the street, and people on the street squeezed to both sides. He also became lazy and threw down his broom, squatted down at the back corner of the road, spat out a few mouthfuls of white foam, and rested, panting. During this moment of rest, he often recalled many past events:</p>
<p>[At the age of thirty-five, I transferred from a machinery shop to a munitions factory and was assigned to the machine gun factory, specializing in making machine gun triggers. Although I didn't make many triggers, I could make five frames a day. After they were made, they were tested once, and then, along with other guns, they were transported on a small train to the South Station, and then transferred to the capital. Day after day, batch after batch, what was the end use?</p>
<p>Whenever the country was in turmoil, the southern soldiers were going to fight the northern soldiers, or the northern soldiers were fighting towards the south, all sectors of society were inevitably panicked. Cotton mills had to reduce work, and shops had to clear out their inventory. But our lives actually improved, with double shifts day and night. As long as you could endure it, you could work non-stop for twenty-four hours a day, urgently making them, urgently transporting them. At this time, I only vaguely saw that machine guns were a powerful weapon for sweeping fire in wartime, and I knew that they were being transported to sweep fire at the northern or southern soldiers.</p>
<p>Once, the turmoil came even more fiercely. The higher-ups issued an order saying that within ten days, whether it was Sunday or night, the machines were not allowed to stop. If you couldn't endure it, you could freely find helpers, and the factory would bear the wages. It turned out that the invincible Revolutionary Army was attacking, and a large number of guns and bullets were needed to block the battle. On the fifth day, suddenly the pistol factory stopped working, and the whole factory discovered some declarations and leaflets. Everyone was in an uproar, saying that the Revolutionary Army, which relieved the suffering of the people, had arrived. Were we still manufacturing weapons to block the battle? There was only the reason to strike and welcome them.</p>
<p>After this tumultuous period, the Revolutionary Army did arrive. So, a labor union was added to our factory, and everyone continued to live as before, day after day, making them, batch after batch, transporting them to where? For what use? As vague as ever. After that, there were several more tense periods of urgent work, but no new Revolutionary Army came to attack.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese soldiers occupied Shenyang, it was said that the munitions factory there had been burned down, and batches of machinists fled to Shanghai and petitioned our factory, requesting to be taken in. I don't know why, but at that time, our factory adopted a tight policy. Although no news of panic had come about our own lives, night work was of course not needed. When the Japanese soldiers burned and killed in Zhabei, it was our time to be robbed. An order came down to reduce work, and a second order came down to stop work. When the third order came down, it was the end of our lives, and the factory closed.</p>
<p>When I left the machine factory, looking up at the Japanese planes in the sky, desperately using machine guns to sweep downward, I strongly felt that machine guns were originally powerful weapons in wartime. But our factory closed its doors. It seemed that when it came to resisting Japan and opposing imperialism, machine guns were not needed. What a big [riddle] it is. |]</p>
<p>[The riddle] is always a [riddle]. He couldn't understand it. When the roaring cars had passed and the people on the street had dispersed, he self-consciously and bitterly picked up his broom and slowly swept the street.</p>

<p>— Huan Yi</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received a letter from a friend, which contained a passage: […What I hate most when running on the road are the outstretched hands of the "Begging Generals" shrinking by the roadside. But</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>now? I really admire their perseverance. The art of making people take money out of their own pockets. For the big theme of saving the country through aviation, I did the job of begging for money for three days... I received I don’t know how many lessons, and saw I don’t know how many kinds of faces... Today I know that money is so mysterious and so great...] Originally, bookworms who make a living in books are as arrogant as frogs in a well, how do they know how big the sky is? This is not that I intentionally insult general reading friends, it is really a conclusion of the experience I got after stepping out of the school gate and climbing into this society. What's more, he is a little brother of seventeen or eighteen years old who has not yet left the middle school gate?</p>
<p>I remember that in the reply I gave him, I wrote a few sentences like this: […In the eyes of money, everything in the world can be seen. If you want to know: what color is the world? What does society look like? What is the original shape of people? You only need to look through the eyes of money, and you probably won't be wrong... A coin is held in your hand, although it doesn't weigh much, but if you weigh everything it sees in its eyes, ah! [I really know your hard work and seriousness.] A trace of a smile suddenly appeared on the gloomy, thin, and dark boss's face.</p>
<p>[Oh! The boss knows everything.]</p>
<p>Clearly, this is a seductive and mysterious tone. Of course! The boss knows everything. In a few months, there is hope of adding a little money. The young man's labor is all sold, and the young man's soul is also hooked away. Cough! Some blood is mixed in with the white phlegm. Ah! Work hard, and in a few months, there is hope of adding a little money. The boss knows very well, knows it.]</p>
<p>Cough! Cough! The mouth is full of blood, and some red floats on the pale yellow face, but it fades away in an instant and turns gray and white. The eyeballs have sunk. The body has also fallen down. There is shaking in the ears, I really know it.]</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>[Granny: Please lend me a month's salary, I won't dare to bother you again next time.] Aunt Wang stood there respectfully, trembling, and said to the granny sleeping on the bed because she wanted to borrow four yuan to send her son to school to learn a few words.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the young master who was sleeping facing the inside was awakened, and with a flip of his body and a pull of his arm, he covered the granny's face with the quilt, muttering: Let's sleep for a while longer, tell her to go call us later.</p>
<h3 id="e291">[Qualification] and [Diploma] <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>In the past, during the imperial examination era, a poor boy, as long as he had aspirations and worked hard for ten years in a cold window, had the hope of soaring to prominence. But what about now? The imperial examination was abolished long ago, and schools are increasingly money-oriented, so poor boys can no longer think about such cheap things. Not spend a lot of money, but have great hope?</p>
<p>However, talking again, in today's society, to emphasize studying, it is difficult for poor boys, and it is not easy for rich young masters, because in today's studies, other things can be ignored, but diplomas are important. Without a diploma, even if you have money, it is useless! Not only is it not welcome in society, but it is also not wanted in schools. But saying that a piece of paper is a diploma, cannot be eaten when hungry, and cannot be worn when cold, but it is so precious! No wonder there are people who, without a diploma, want to post advertisements to seek one.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 19th), I read this newspaper and saw this text in the important classified advertisement column [Seeking a Diploma in Law and Politics], which said: [The Wu surname wants to transfer to study abroad and use a Jiangsu Wuxian registered residence as the best. If there are any who want to transfer it, please send a detailed letter with the minimum conditions to No. 14 Zhaoxing Lane, Bao'an Road, Deswei Road. If it suits, we will make an appointment to meet and talk] and so on. After reading this paragraph of soliciting text, I realized that the diploma that is valued by the public can be solicited with money! So, I have always envied people who have [Doctorate], [Master's], [Bachelor's] and other qualifications. Logically, it can naturally also be solicited by posting an advertisement. But alas, I don’t have this spare money, so I can only sigh at other people’s [qualifications] and [diplomas]. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e292">Correspondence from a Shop Assistant <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am very grateful for your instructions in the previous letter—that is, instructions to the youth—at least to me personally. Now I am here to trouble you again, and I hope you won't refuse? Yesterday, I was chatting with a mechanic in the factory and inadvertently talked about religion; unexpectedly, he tried his best to preach [the doctrine of Jesus] to me! It turned out that he was a Christian. Naturally, Christianity is expanding day by day under our influence, spreading to the Chinese mainland. In the sermons, there are often one or two missionaries who deeply imprint [God Jesus] into the minds of innocent children. What a profound intention this is! In Shanghai? Christianity is so popular! It seems that joining Christianity is the expression that people in the new era should have. Is Christianity so modernized? If not, you seem to be lagging behind. Who would be willing to lag behind? Joining Christianity is being aware of the times and keeping up with the times!</p>
<p>He—the mechanic—told me how he believed in Christianity, that Jesus is the Christ, and how Christ healed his years of tuberculosis and got rid of his gambling and smoking... He also cited many evidences, as if the omnipotent Christ was right in front of him! On the one hand? He said that Buddhism is [superstitious] and stupid, and that only by joining Christianity can one ascend to [heaven] and not suffer in [hell]! His words were incessant, in short, he was a Christian and of course he was promoting Christianity. But I think his words are extremely contradictory! Because Christianity has [the Kingdom of Heaven], shouldn't Buddhism be allowed to have [Paradise]? Christ is the omnipotent God, can't Sakyamuni be said to be the omnipotent Bodhisattva? Believing in Buddhism is superstition, but believing in Christianity is not superstition. They recite scriptures and kowtow, you pray and worship, aren't they the same? The same superstition, so who is superstitious and who is not superstitious? However, I think that no matter what religion, at least its purpose is commendable. Jesus called on people to walk the right path and be good people; isn't Buddhism also calling on people to do good? In the beginning, this main purpose was so pure! But the later believers only knew the what, but not the why, blindly chanting scriptures or praying; how would they know that this is precisely because they feared that future generations would not believe, so they used the words of God and Bodhisattva, relying on the ethereal nature to make you believe and stop you from doing evil. Now, with the slightest difference, some people blindly believe that they are going to [heaven]! How could this be the original intention of the founder? As for the missionaries from abroad, I don't know what doctrine they hold. I guess they don't have good intentions. There are too many words, I am afraid it has gone beyond the scope of correspondence? Sir! What do you think, please do not hesitate to give me your advice. Finally, I want to declare that I do not believe in any religion, this is purely to speak from the perspective of an onlooker. It is not intended to criticize Christianity or Buddhism! Please do not misunderstand! Wishing you peace Zhong Xing, respectfully</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Religion is something of the past in this era, we know that since the existence of mankind, except for the prehistoric era before recorded history, which we have no way to verify; descending to ancient and medieval times, at that time there were few human beings and it was easier to make a living, and human beings were relatively easy to satisfy with the material necessities of life. However, the evolution of society depends entirely on the human [dissatisfaction] as the driving force for its advancement. Therefore, the prophets and seers of that time created the theory of the second world, so that human efforts could have their goals. Various religions are the product of this; so Christianity has the theory of heaven and hell, and Buddhism also has the theory of heaven and hell. Extending this to all other religions, all are intended to make human beings, in addition to working hard for food and clothing in their lives, work even harder for this ethereal second world. This is the so-called idealistic era.</p>
<p>But in modern times, the population has increased day by day, and the competition for survival has become increasingly acute. Even if human beings exhaust their life's efforts for the material necessities of life, there is still the suffering of being unable to satisfy them. Driven by hunger and cold, they have no choice but to plunder each other, and even with strict laws, it is not enough to make them fearful, let alone the punishment of this ethereal second world? That is, of course, completely ineffective. In this era, [idealism] has been defeated by [materialism]; all religions have become arrows at the end of their flight. Understanding this principle, we can know that all religions have no room for existence now. Then why are churches still popular there now? We should know that modern religion has lost its true face and has become a tool used by imperialists to anesthetize the population and implement their aggression. Don't you see that religion with the same value is gradually declining because no one is using it!</p>
<p>We should now see through the hypocrisy of all religions, overthrow all products of the idealistic view of history; only materialism can solve our lives and point out our way out!</p>

<p>— Edited by Ling</p>
<p>20. The Beginning of a New Life</p>
<p>This was indeed a new experience for her, in fact, she had changed to a new master. However, what made her happiest was being able to be with Zhang Wenbin often. Whenever Minister Su did not have time to watch her, she would hide Zhang Wenbin in her room, just like a newly married couple, hugging and joking around, which was quite leisurely and comfortable.</p>
<p>Due to these days and nights spent together, she now understood everything about Zhang Wenbin even more. In addition, he became even more unrestrained, talking about everything without reservation. Thus, she learned that he was a recent graduate of Peking University, so his background was also quite remarkable. Now he was a First-Class Clerk in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which, compared to the official titles of the former Qing Dynasty, was at least above the fifth rank. Being so young and so successful was certainly not easy. Another thing that made the Fifth Concubine most happy was that he still did not have a formal wife. Although he had had a sallow-faced wife before, she had died soon after. From this, she thought that if she could treat him well, it would not be a problem, and he could follow her wholeheartedly for the rest of her life. As for his talent, it goes without saying that even during his student days, he had done something earth-shattering. That year, when Beijing attacked Cao Rulin and Zhang Zongxiang, he was one of the most radical. Although it was not necessarily because of this that he became a historical figure, he was full of energy and excitement when mentioning his past achievements. It was precisely because of this that the Fifth Concubine felt that now was the beginning of happiness: he was so young and so passionate, and such a man naturally added a lot of vitality to her life. Thus, she believed that now was a meaningful life.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, she couldn't help but feel very excited, even feeling hot all over. So she walked to the bedside, gazed at his healthy sleeping face, and couldn't help but lean down and tightly hug his head, kissing his lips heavily. A strong passion made her feel an extremely pressured numbness in her heart. She knew very clearly that in the body temperature of any man, she had never aroused such a strong pleasure. A gust of autumn wind moved the curtain in front of the window slowly.</p>
<p>When she looked up, Zhang Wenbin was naturally awakened by her kiss. He half-opened his eyelids, looked at her sweet smile, but turned over and went back to sleep soundly. At this time, the Fifth Concubine could not help but feel a little sad. She knew that this was because she had been indulging in sex too much in recent days.</p>
<p>So she immediately shouted to He Xiang:</p>
<p>[Isn't there more bird's nest at home? Stew a bowl for me properly, and make sure it's clean.] [Who's it for?] He Xiang was being deliberately playful again. [It's none of your business!] She also smiled, seemingly about to get angry.</p>
<p>[Of course it's none of my business, but if the master asks later, [Who's it for?] how am I going to answer?] The Fifth Concubine was about to open her eyes and scold her when she saw Wu Gui running in, covered in sweat, saying: [Quick! Quick! The master is here.] So the Fifth Concubine immediately ran into the room. He Xiang, regardless of the consequences, helped Yan Wenbin up, dragging and pulling him back to his room. Correcting the serial novel of the Fifth Concubine. Yesterday's section ○○ should be placed after section 20 (this issue) because of mis-arrangement. We hereby correct it.</p>
