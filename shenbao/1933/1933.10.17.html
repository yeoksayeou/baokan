<p>當軍縮會議重開之初。各國利害衝突。已甚劇烈。特别是德法間之軍備平等問題。更爲嚴重。德國國社黨爲貫澈其對外政策。堅决主張軍備平等。於是不僅惹起凡爾賽條約之先導者法蘭西極度反感。即精神上寄與德意志以若干同情之意大利。亦甚懷不安。德國在此環境中。見軍備平等之要求。難以貫澈。乃遂决計投一巨彈。於本月十四正式聲明退出軍缩會議以目前世界一般政治經濟情勢而論。政治則互相對立。危機四伏。經濟則盛倡聯盟。恐慌日甚德國忽然有此退出軍缩會議與國際聯盟之舉。當然爲世界所驚駭加緊法蘭西軍事方面之急切凖備。鼓動意大利法西斯主義之猛烈進行。搖動英吉利利用兩强對立之傳統政策。激起蘇聯在外交上之硬化此爲勢所必然者。吾人如單就一般形勢以曲直論。德國軍備平等之要求。爲凖備自衛。原無不當。且亦適合於日爾曼民族之傳統習慣。然從另一方面觀察法國恐德之心理未除。故主張維持凡爾賽和約。堅持其所謂安全保障。亦自有其適當之解脫。英國之對德同情。僅此於制限法國之過度强大。其不願德意志之突飛猛進。亦甚顯著。觀近數月英國左袒法國外交。即足爲證。至於意大利。雖同爲法西斯主義國家。又復同情於修改凡爾賽和約者。不過法西斯主義。原以國家至上爲極則。在勢在理。皆不能與其他一國相恊調。况意大利修改和約之意。與德國大相懸殊。故其同情於德國運動。自有一定之界限。逾此界限。即不免變友爲仇。蘇聯原爲另一範疇。立於中歐諸國紛爭以外。德國原不難運用外交手腕。借蘇聯以制英法。且蘇聯五年計劃中之機械及其他製造品。多由德國輸入。但自國社黨之所謂國策推行以來。蘇聯商務購買已轉而之他。在蘇德籍人員。近亦被辭。退德蘇之間。政治上發生顯明之裂痕。經濟上亦難維持從前之在善。而同時法蘇與意蘇間愈趨接近。可見德國已處於孤立之境地矣。</p>
<p>夫德國之窮。世所知也。當國社黨秉政之初。其對内經經濟政策仍蹈襲巴本舊路。傾向於國家資本主義。是爲一般所共知之事實。其窒礙難行。不能脫離金融資本之掌握。固在意中。自胡根堡落職。人壽保險公司總理席米德繼任經濟農業部長而後。即公言德國經濟與前無異。而國社黨本部。亦發佈通告放棄百貨商店之國有政策。且禁止其黨員對百貨店之暴行。由此可知德國國社黨於其國内經濟政策。漸已不能見諸實施。而一般社會激昂之情緒又無法平定。故第一步乃借打擊猶太人以洩憤。繼以脫退國際聯盟與軍縮會議。以激起國民一時之興奮。而在國際關係間則受空前之激刺。因此種興奮與激刺之結果。隧使奄奄一息之軍缩會議。或竟促起另一種有力之聯合。轉幾一種新局面。亦未可知歟。</p>
<p>德國退出國聯軍缩後。在精神上固表示要求軍備平等之决心。事實上則提倡軍事工業。用渡經濟上之危難。是其擴張軍備之嫌。萬不能避法國對此情狀。勢必亟起設法以鞏固其在歐洲大陸之領導霸權。鞏固霸權之道。對中歐諸小國。以經濟爲主力。對德問題。則必借口安全保障。擴張軍備。同時運用外交。使奥匈入其掌握。與蘇聯取得諒解。意大利至少取中立態度。英國於此亦將對法友善。德國際此緊急時期。愛國之情火。必將猛烈燃燒。列國暗中擴充軍備之舉。一變而爲明爭。是等於火上添油。最終結果。不免於一塲惡戰。固意中事也。</p>

<p>該會主任委員陳光甫就職演說詞、略謂、今日棉業統制委員會開成立會、光甫奉命做主任委員、適間宋部長訓話、要我們全體委員、來努力任此救國救民工作、爲國家社會服務、光甫何敢畏難、光甫對於棉業、未有深切研究今日要用統制　段、來對付棉業、也許有不少人發生誤會、此統制兩字、當然是一種國家　權的、有計劃的、去管理某種事業、不過就光甫所知、此次中央統制棉業、决不是要將棉業收歸國營、也不是不容自由資本存在、不過想用政治方量、來</p>
<p>帮助事業界向前進取、事業界本身力有不及者、都由統制委員會負責去做、統制委員會之設、不過想集合事業界多數有思想有作爲者、併成一個單位、更用政府力量作後盾、來爲國家社會盡義務、這是我可負責說明的、棉業範圍自然甚大、從鄉下人種棉花起、中間有販運的棉商、有製造的紗廠布廠和漂染整理廠、再由販運紗布商人、銷賣到最後的消費者、以及間接關係的附屬事業、都是屬於棉業範圍、不過紗廠爲棉業中的靈魂、没有紗廠的國家、便不好算爲有棉業、有了紗廠而大家都無法維持、也是等於無棉業、近來紗廠業情形之壞、各方面所受影響、也就夠嚴重了、他的原因複雜、不暇細說、天災人禍、内憂外患、都是他的病案、而世界經濟恐慌的對象、使中國更暴露出生產落後國家的弱點、過去多少次的維持救濟、终至一無結果、尤其足以証明這個問題、已絶對非局部的方法可以收效、非有大規模、大手腕的辦法、來做整個的澈底的佈置不可、於是棉業統制委員會、乃應時而生、不是偶然之故、但是這棉業统制委員會、將來究竟要做點什麽工作呢、這個工作、我們必須等全體委員來詳細討論、方能决定方案、不過社會上已有許多人注意於此、我覺得在可能範圍内、有先來說一個大綱的必要、第一、我們的根本工作、先須從原料上做起、一方面來推廣產量、一方面來改良品質、這是棉業專家本有相當計劃的、我們現在要充實人才組織、積極進行、希望在相當時間内、得到最大效果、不過植棉之外、我們還要從運銷上、檢騐上、加以組織、譬如接濟棉農金融、制定棉花等級、剷除棉花攙水積弊、諸如此類、都要積極舉辦、使紗廠原料可以自給自足、這是關於原料方面的、第二、關於製造方面者、要辦的事、比較更多、我們先要聘請專家、分别研究、才可以定辦法出來、一面再調查事業界實際狀况、編制統計、以作研究資料、大槪工廠設備、工攻效率、製品標凖、會計制度、勞工問題、等等、都應該有相當辦法來整理、要使辦紡織工廠者、大家都可以跟了去做、達到一種經濟營合理化的領域、這是我們要用全副精神去做的、同時我們還要從各種側面、來促進事業的向上、好像培植人才的技術敎育、輔助技術研究的各種設備、自製紡織機械的鐵工廠、和供給紡織廠用品的附屬事業、也要分别去推設、這是第二步工作、第三、對於紗布的運銷方面、我們也要有相當辦法去應付、尤其在目前紗廠情勢困艱的當中、救濟自屬不容稍緩、譬如滞貨的疏通、市價的穏定、金融的接濟、稅制的改革、我們都想設法來辦、不過收效是否可以滿足事業界希望、我們暫時尙不敢多說、不過總要竭力地去做、這是治標的工作、這三個階段連起來講、便是我們整個統制棉業的工作、從農村輸出原料到工廠、再從工廠輸入製品到農村去、其間組織經過、都要有一種最優良、最適當的聯絡、使其循環貫通、毫無阻滞、全國經濟血脈、自然可以流通、社會民生、也自然趨於安定了、不過這個流通的程度、還是　要看我們大家努力的程度怎樣、要看全國人民合作的精神怎樣、努力程度合作精神、有一分不到、那我們工作的效果、也須减色一分、所以我們的工作、還是要請全國人民共同恊助才好、最後還有一言、方才宋部長說、祇要我們有辦法、有計劃、對於經費一層、政府方面可以完全擔承、這句話、自然可以使我們增加不少　勇氣、將來統制委員會製定方案、提出計劃、我們當然要經過極愼重之研究和審查、我今天可預先向部長聲明、不是切實有效的方案、我們不向政府提呈、旣經提出方案、務必要請政府核准、同時更希望政府、從各方面給予便利和力量、</p>

<p>男子網球、今晨九時起、開始複賽、上海邱飛海將與吧之許承基一較身手、作滬吧之第一單打賽、二人技藝超羣、必有精美表演、雙打吧僑棄權、故第二單打之勝負、關係甚巨、滬之代表、諒屬王文正、王氏果出塲、須沉著應戰、蓋吧僑林續音亦係第一流將才也、川對冀、勝利十九歸川、因川擁有名將林寳華錢耀彬也、</p>

<p>巴城二十歲少年網球家許承基、確實後生可畏、銳利非凡、砲彈式之發球、較林寳華尤勝攔網之隠健、邱飛海亦不及、抽球銳急、惜反手則較弱耳、部位與脚步工作、均臻上乘、惟經騐似猶未足、每有失之交臂之憾、平高惠民爲華北名手、國人盡知、近來球藝益有進步、發球上網、均有功夫、觀第三盤之得勝、第四盤之劇戰、鋒芒極顯、洵非偶然、而許始终未去其絨衫、其實太陽驕炎非常、</p>
<h3 id="c178">馬到成功 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>開始比賽、高惠民發球、互相上網、高取首局、許發球、滑四全勝、高再得發球局後、許一路順風、聲東擊西、無往不利、高失誤時出、控制失策、一籌莫展、許乃以六比一勝首盤、第二盤開始、高發球全勝、許於一比三之局勢、下四記有力發球、扳回發球局、從此得一而再、迭以上網制勝、穏健機警、高之抽擊及高級、均被殺退、一無生路、又以一比六敗、</p>
<h3 id="c179">形勢突變 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>高連失兩盤後、力謀報復、第三盤開始、聲勢忽然一振、以猛銳峻急之抽球、攻破許之攔網、而許亦時出失誤、發球亦每多失分、高得以四比二局佔優、許以發球局全勝、高又成五比三、許亦加一局、成五比四、高發球、雙方有劇戰、最許後以一觸網球而失利、高乃以六比四扳回一盤、</p>

<p>第四盤高仍有良好表演、使許承基不敢造次、得勝首局後、高用念球向邊界進攻、許上網無效、乃成各一、以後各勝發球局、屢成平手、軒輊難分、但許得利於發球之優先權、故每佔先着、四比四後、許再取發球局、而高則於二次上網失手、而失去發球局、許遂以六比四再勝、</p>

<p>力滬大將邱飛海、業已到京、但十六晨滬粤第一單打、滬仍由王文正出陣、蓋邱養精蓄銳、預備與巴城許承基、在複賽中大戰故也、然粤徐惠培、少年有爲、藝與王文正相若、實未可輕視今晨比賽、王文正幾乎失敗、劇戰五盤、王始以三比二盤獲勝、亦云險矣、</p>

<p>徐連下二局、王則屈居下風、繼王取得發球局、於是局勢大轉、王鋒芒大露、連得四局、以五比二後來居上、第八局徐發球以四十對零分佔絶對優勢、但王鎭定應付、反勝此局、乃王以六比二取得首盤、</p>

<p>第二盤始雙方競爭甚烈、初則王徐各得發球局、繼則又各失發球局、至五五平手、王以滑四取得球局、以六比五局佔先後、徐發球王極有者勝可能、但因過分大意、遂失是局、造成六六和局、而後王反失發球局、卒王以六比八敗北、</p>
<h3 id="c184">後來居上 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>第三盤徐努力進攻、先得二局、王急起直追、扳回一局、於是王用聲東擊西之法、使徐來往奔走、但徐奔跑迅速、應竹裕如、王計不得售、又以四比六再敗、乃徐反以二比一盤後來居上、</p>

<p>休息片刻、再戰聲起、第四盤初雙方亦各勝發球局、至三三平手後、王發球因雙失誤送掉、徐則連得發球局、而以五比三局領前、是時滬千鈞一髮、危險萬分、幸王振作精神、沈着應付、連奪四局、反以七比五勝第四盤、底定大局、第五盤王一帆風順、聲勢洶洶、徐則失誤頻頻、奔跑遲緩、與前判若兩人、開賽之初、王卽控制一切、卒以六比一勝、總計王以三比二盤克徐、</p>

<p>結果三比零</p>
<p>（南京十六日電）男排球第一場、上海對北平、裁判員高錫威、上海排球按兵已久、借以初次輪空、大會觀衆望眼欲穿、二時許、小小看台、已有人滿之患、</p>

<p>比二雄蒞塲、滬隊先開戰端、平將前後呼應、關門傳殺、各有專責、滬將煆鍊有素、不論來得善惡、终是小心應戰、但見球出迅速、旋盤空中、滬將徐亨曹式贊、横蠻無禮、於平隊謙讓之餘、猶作大刀殺敵、初二兩局、上海二次皆旋、</p>
<h3 id="c214">最後奮鬥力盡而敗 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>（南京十六日電）第一場香港對福建、以香港歷次戰績、輕取福建、自爲必然、但是日福建隊伍、異常頑强、福建李賡桓發球竟連得七分、香港輕敵、險出毛病、極力扳轉、已讓福建以十一對六佔先、換場方向旣掉、奇特戰迹、亦隨同轉變、但見香港前排沿網飛蹝、而中排之托球及兩翼容迺焯胡耀東之壓球、尤其神出鬼没、聲東擊西、滿場呌彩、如此三番四復、居然港隊以平等分數、而超越前進、第一局以念一比十七勝、</p>

<p>第二局港隊活動更烈、福建雖嚴肅陣容、冷靜抵檔、但中排失誤甚多、又以十二比念一敗於香港、第三局港軍威風依舊福建亦不甘示弱、前排林長槍曾有極妙玲瓏之壓球表演、但勢頭不對、直到裁判員高錫威鳴警收兵、仍以十一比念一敗於香港、轉結果爲三對零、</p>

<p>（南京十六日電）上海對北平之女疊球賽、頗爲此項之關鍵、蓋滬平粤三隊均爲此次之個中能手、尤以平隊曾連獲二次華北錦標、滬隊僅經月餘之短期訓練、故聞之而生畏、</p>
<h3 id="c219">先發制人立還顏色 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>比賽之初、平隊先發制人、首由劉孝洞姚襄立跑回兩分、滬隊反攻甚烈、平隊因屢生錯誤遂得先後跑回三分、任淑孟健麗曹惠瓊三人各樹一動、第二局開始時、平隊鍾漢蓀跑回得一分、滬隊陸璞珍亦跑回一分</p>
<h3 id="c220">猛襲之下危在旦夕　第三局時平隊連殺死滬隊三 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>人、滬隊亦連殺死平隊三人第三局中無建樹而終、第四局開始時、平隊猛攻不已、鄭炳華先跑回一分、趙晋漢再擊成本壘打、鍾漢蓀·信安中、又先後生還、總計此局之中、平一舉得四分、此時形勢七比四平勝一瀉千里、滬隊危在旦夕、</p>
<h3 id="c221">意外收獲滿載而歸 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>不料滬隊反攻之時、意外順利、李實蕙向張榮孟麗曾惠瓊湯月英、孫璋鄒善德徐文英陸璞珍各得跑回一分、一舉而得九分平隊第五局反攻時、僅進一分、於是滬以十三比八獲勝、得决賽權、</p>

<p>全國精銳會聚一場</p>
<p>奪標大戰卽在目前</p>
<p>（南京十六日電）各項球類比賽、均至複賽週中、集中全國精銳、作最後之努力、精彩劇烈之競爭、滬上球迷尙有無機得飽眼福爲憾、記者特將各類形勢、叙述如下、俾不能親臨覩戰之能聊以解渴耳</p>
<h3 id="c229">（一）足球 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>滬港粤冀四巨頭、叙會十七複賽、冀粤於二時起、滬港於四時起、均改在田徑場内舉行、作戰之劇烈、在意料中、以實力而論滬港之戰、滬希望較大、莫隊卽天津中華隊、有孫恩敬等、實力不凡、足與粤力鬥、形勢必甚甚張、然勝利則以粤較穏、</p>
<h3 id="c230">（二）男子網球 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>網球好手、无遇於右部、左部俱屬庸俗之流、十六半複賽滬王文正對粤徐惠培、平高惠民巴許承基、及滬余田光對粤黎廣駿、均屬名貴之作、十七複賽滬遇巴城極饒興趣、許承基對邱飛海之戰、必轟動一時、據林寳華談、邱可以三比一盤勝、查許與高惠民之戰、殊少精彩表演、但許發球佳攔網佳、邱均不及、面許亦以發球及攔網見長、邱則反之、然則邱許之戰、猶難測定誰勝、以全體而論、無論邱獲勝負、王文正可穏勝林續音、而雙打巴無選手、格於會章、只能棄權、故上海必勝無疑、</p>
<h3 id="c231">（三）男子籃球 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>籃球各地均甚晋及、除冀魯滬粤菲僑等外、南京崛起、不可小視、其他各地、亦甚强勁、前途可喜、菲隊不遠萬里而來、僅作二戰卽受淘汰、可惜之至、今後複賽權者、爲滬對粤、湘對京、查滬粤兩隊均較冀京減色、今冀京先行火併、殊爲不幸、冀有唐寳堃沈秉聿于敬孫等、名開全國、京隊咸元懐魏海青姜十選等、亦精銳非凡、兩雄火併、勝負難卜、滬粤之戰、滬善智取、粤線覃　英雄、滬希望較大、</p>
<h3 id="c232">（四）男子排球 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>排球得複賽權者、爲粤對浙、港對滬、浙雖係後起、决非粤敵、粤之邱廣爕盧康元死併滬隊、但實力依舊不減、煞是利害、港非滬敵、滬勝北平、易如反掌、平亦不弱、滬竟能輕描淡寫以勝之、可見滬隊實力非小、可定爲粤之大敵、我國排球多於南國最强、然此番滬隊大有喧賓奪主之勢、</p>
<h3 id="c233">（五）棒球 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>棒球爲平冀滬港湘五隊挑戰湘不足取、滬已落伍、今番雖有不少新進、兼用梁氏昆仲之海外威風、卒無建樹、爲冀隊淘汰、港旣勝平、競奪該項錦標者、爲冀港兩隊、港歷史最久本年並獲全港公開冠軍、技術可觀、冀雖後進、不可忽視、但錦標港穏取無疑、</p>
<h3 id="c234">（六）女子籃球 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>女子部、籃球滬閩奪標、呼聲最高、不幸過於次賽、滬於危險萬分中、打出生路、以一分而勝、可謂徼倖之至、平心而論、閩之技藝確在滬上、滬旣渡此難關、前途頗可樂觀、平粤亦不弱、兩隊複賽、粤可操勝券、冀不足取、滬可穏勝、滬粤决賽、必有劇戰、滬之希望較厚、惟猶須謹愼從事、不可造次、觀各隊球藝、均甚滿意、男女籃球之普及、令人十分欣慰、</p>
<h3 id="c235">（七）女子排球 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>排球各隊實力相彷、女子體育之進步、誠如青雲之直上滬粤港三隊雞羣鶴立皆係不凡、與男子排球之形勢、如出一轍、一旦决賽、勢必閙翻排球塲、複賽滬對粤、港對平、於十八舉行、港可必勝、滬粤火併、令人擔憂、</p>
<h3 id="c236">（八）女子網球 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>

<h3 id="c237">（九）女子壘球 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>壘球滬隊歷史短、遠遜冀平粤、然進步之速、出於意料、切戰勝豫、再戰克平、果然奪得决賽權、而與華北冠軍、北平一戰、預料必敗、良以平隊服裝、紮管馬褲、與男子之裝束同一、望而知爲勁旅、然滬隊竟能以十三比八戰勝、誠令人驚喜交集、决賽之對手爲粤京之優勝者、京以佈局嚴固勝、粤以打擊猛烈勝、比較言之、粤可以勝、日後滬粤决賽、大有可觀、滬隊能否得勝、全持外場員之投接功夫而定、</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>在我國舊式社會裏，誰都知道職業中最高貴的，要算讀書和種田，最爲寫意，（一耕二讀），天下人再没有讀書的人來得清高，種田的人來得神聖。</p>
<p>三十六行行行出狀元，顯現實的人說起來，凡是一種職業，都有一種職業的快樂，最苦的是失業游民，他們終日無所事，麵包問題，没有着落，根本上却不崇拜（一耕二讀）的主義，職業，在他們只要博得到（一耕二讀））</p>
<p>，他們是絶對不放在心上。</p>
<p>水行倒盡頭，會得倒回來，（一耕二讀），國體改革以來，本已打破階級觀念，但是復古運重的輪盤，又旋轉到眼前，（嚴格會者），（復興農村），畢竟數千年我們崇拜的耕讀主義，還是被人們敎仰重視。</p>
<p>近代的社會，在環呈不景氣的氛圍璄，耕讀的本身，已呈破壞，萎靡，的現象，我們絶對表示着十二分哀弔，尚何能談到崇拜，水災，旱災，殼賤傷農，農人肚子，不但實行緊缩政策，還要撑着身體，向田裏去工作，讀書人比較格外不得勁，洋鈿，鈔票，用了成千成百，眼巴巴的望着升事，畢業，末了畢業儘可畢業，出路仍然没得。</p>
<p>在這國内耕讀兩大問題，已成强弩之末的情形下，（嚴格會考），（復興農村），雖然是一方面設法救濟，一方面從嚴拔取人材，但是就耕讀本身的人們看起來，自已勞心勞力所得，遠不及大都市裡電影院裏賣票員和跳舞場上舞女的生活，來得舒適，寫意，因此人們對於（一耕二讀）的信仰，也像做投機事業一樣，僥倖與失敗的觀念，永遠存在胸中交戰着不得開交。</p>
<h3 id="c274">照例 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>照例的事，世界上實是舉不勝舉。照例起身，照例睡覺··照例吃喝，照例排泄；照例發洩性慾，照例生男育女。這是全人類共同的照例。</p>
<p>照例通信，照例會面，照例追求，照例結合，照例分離。這是我國一輩青年男女最摩登的照例。</p>
<p>照例讀書，以前可以照例畢業。可是行了會考制度，這個（畢業），似乎有些不能（照例）了。然而聽說會考可加（底分），則（畢業）依舊是個（照例）。</p>
<p>照例抵制日貨，照例私進日貨；照例大廉價，照例暗加底碼。這個（照例）已成爲（照例）的照例。</p>
<p>照例投狀進呈，照例（仰候核辦），照例（礙難照准），照例（毋得再凟干咎）。這是官廳方面的一種通用的照例。</p>
<p>照例開會如儀，照例討論章則，照例提出議案，照例議决否决或保留，照例通令所屬一體遵守，照例手續已了。這也是一個照例。</p>
<p>照例是紀念日，我國特别多。遇着了，總是照例開會紀念，照例報告演說，照例丢腦後。這也是一個照例。</p>
<p>照例辭職，照例挽留，照例復職。據說這個（照例），非深明照例的人，决不可貿然（照例）。</p>
<p>照例國聯開會，照例各國代表到會，照例也有提議决議，照例各報也重視這一類的新聞。這是一年一度應有的照例。照例不屈，照例軟化；照例向人訴苦，照例旁人掉頭睬；照例要想報復，</p>
<p>照例且慢想法。這個（照例），只要睜眼一看，弱小者受了仇家的欺侮，是不是有這樣一個（照例）？</p>
<p>照例！照例！除了上述全人類共同的照例，自不能不照例外；其餘的（照例），不知要照例到何時，纔没有這種（照例），纔没有這種可詫可歎的（照例）！</p>
<h3 id="c275">對校長聯歡會的感想 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 關關</p>
<p>十只黄狗九只雄，十個敎員九個窮，辦敎育事業的同志，在八九年前，被某名人算定了終身，所以一直到現在，各自肚裏曉得，個個在閙着經濟聓慌。（不景氣），在現代社會中，雖說是普遍的現象，但尤其是敎育罷，長衫要穿的，老師的架子要擺的，最低的慾望，一切的開支，那一件能免，那一件可省！唉！說也可憐，終日忙忙，始得一飽，這樣環境之下，别說没有閑錢，能支配在娱樂項下，就是連閑工夫也没有呀！可是事實往往會出於一般人的理想之外的，在這各業閙着恐慌的上海，新近却有校長聯歡會的組織，大家摸出一塊錢來，每月舉行一次，而加入的會員，幾近二百餘校，這出乎意料之外的情形，很明顯的表現着，幹清寒生活的同志，已有了新的覺悟，他們已感着欲改良現狀欲在困苦中謀出路，須共同團結，相互研討的必要了。</p>
<p>這是前天晚上，在青年會門口，標着中小學校長聯歡會的紙條，我就走上樓去，簽字名，付了費，入得門來，只見大禮堂中，坐滿了態度嚴肅，道貎可掬的校長先生，大家靜悄悄的正着身子，在注神靜聽；再回頭向講臺望去，原來頂頭上司潘局長，在那裏演講。俗語說··（不怕官，只怕管），現在學校校長對着敎育局長的演辭，自然悚然危坐，鴉雀無聲的成了模範的聽衆了。</p>
<p>那是第二次的集會，有飯吃，有酒喝，還有敎育影片看，各校長俱樂得笑逐顏開，興會不淺。不過在我認爲不足的，是雍雍穆穆的校長先生，在進濟濟蹌蹌的聚會中，依舊隨便便，缺少朝氣勃勃的眞正的團結精神，譬如說到選舉職員，票子散漫得非常，當時除了有位嗎一先之外，其餘都是一票二票，有了十餘票，就可當選，當然馮君是位　心朋友，爲各人所信仰，但此外熱心而爲衆所周知的，也不在少數，但是却都喜歡，各舉各的，充分表現着法國政治家的態度！</p>
<p>偷得半日閑，化費一塊錢，在被　定工窮酸命的我們，覺得不是一回容易的事，所以還希望此後能利用這機會，來該行眞眞的團結，在這黑暗的社會中，去謀打開一條光明的道路。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十七回</p>
<p>孰能無情家思灰士氣兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>大凡個軍人，無論性情是如何倔强，他總富於服從性。這並不是服從性三個與軍人兩個字，有什麽天生的連带關係。但是軍營中講的第一件大事，便是服從性。軍隊越訓練的好，軍中的人，服從性越大，指揮兵的官長，由總司令到排班長，都是兢兢業業，怕下面的人失去了服從性。因爲貪生怕死，是人的本性，要訓練得整千整萬的人，聽一道命令，視死如歸，這要不訓練出服從性來，怎能辦到。所以當軍人很　的人，不知不覺之間，也就自然會造成了一種服從性。這個時候，趙自强悄然的經過曠野，眞是萬感在心曲。忽然聽到一種軍號聲，他猛然止住了脚步，想道，我走不得。看這回出發情形，有些不同不定什麽時候，會有命令傳下來。我雖然規定兩小時就回營來，設若在兩小時以内，偏偏有了事情，那怎麽辦？我這連内，走了兩個排長，又走了一個連長，一連的事，都交給一個排長嗎？設若這個排長也走了，那又怎麽辦？他不知此想時，就也糊裏糊塗的回海甸去了。經過一番考慮之後，他覺的這事，太不穏當，他越想越害怕，索興走回營裏來了，當他快走到連部的時候，對面就遇到了田青，他緊緊的皺了兩個眉頭，紅着臉走近前來。趙自强遠遠的向他笑着，還没有開口呢，他就笑着先說了。點頭道··老趙，在海甸來嗎？這件事眞是不凑巧呵！說着，手握了趙自强的手，一拍了他的肩膀，這就笑道··我們是同病相憐。說一句文罷，就是英雄氣短，兒女情長。（二一四）</p>

<h3 id="c278">頭髮處理 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>假使你的頭髮失去了本來的美觀，假使你的頭髮，是稀少疎淡，乾枯乏力，幽晦無光澤，衰弱無生氣，那麽毫無疑惑的，致此之因和困難之點，全生於頭垢；有了頭垢，以致頭髮和頭髮根，都變成一種缺少營養的狀態。生頭垢當然有許多原因，其中最普通最重要的一個原因，是缺少適當的梳刷。頭髮好比身體，同樣的需要運動，頭髮的運動，就是頭皮刺戟，這種適當的運動，對於健全的頭髮，非常適宜，非常需要的。刺戟頭皮的方法，除了一朝一晚把頭髮用力地通徹地梳刷兩回之外，别無最好的方法了。但是你要恢復你頭髮的美觀，非選定一種良好的頭髮靈壯劑不可。良好的頭髮强壯劑，須含有一種有效力的成分，能夠殺除滅絶你頭皮上所有頭垢的細菌，以及可以振起你衰弱無力，滋養你乾枯無光的頭髮。你有了這種頭髮强壯劑來擦洗你的頭髮，再加一朝一晚的用力地通徹地梳刷，你頭髮的本來美觀，一定容易恢復，就是其他困難之點，如稀少疎淡，乾枯乏力，幽晦無光澤，衰弱無生氣等等，都可免除。</p>
<h3 id="c279">香水選擇 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>我們應該用那一種香水？這個問題，却是値得討論的。我們天天所拍的粉，總是選擇適合我們的皮膚而購用的，我們去剪頭髮，一定要揀合意的式樣，敎理髮師剪；我們去買一雙皮鞋，總是要揀式樣美觀，尺寸適合的；那麽選擇香水也要如此，非適合我們的個性不可，使我們用了這種香水，可以代表我們一部份的美。有無誘惑性吸引力，那是不必顧及的。有許多女性，十分愛好香氣很濃甜的香水，作爲家用香水；例如鈴蘭，紫羅蘭，紫丁香花，向日葵，玫瑰等等香水。上述的幾種香水，不過是一個大槪，市上所出售的香水，種類當然還要多，我們不妨去選擇一種適合我們個性的，作爲常用的香水。一個考究美容，擅長修飾的人，若能巧妙地應用香水，香水便爲唯一令人愉快的補助物了。切勿多灑，不可灑得過分顯著，那是應用香水最要緊的秘訣。假使你選定了一種適合你自已個性的香水了，那麽你購用的服皂，香粉，潤膚膏等，最好要揀和香水的香味相同的。在目下一切都是考究摩登的時代，美容品，裝飾補助物，多得觸目皆是，要選何種價目，何種品質，香味相同的美容品，定是十分容易的。</p>
<h3 id="c280">皮鞋修補 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>處理皮鞋，妄用了處理衣服的方法，足以造成該用一年之久的皮鞋，現在僅用半年已經破舊的不良結果。所以處理皮鞋，不可大意，施用的方法，不可不謹愼。在選購皮鞋的時候，對於正確適合的尺寸，不可不再三注意，假使皮鞋太小了，在穿上脫下的時候，便要受到一種過度而不正當的伸張，不久就要破裂；假使皮鞋太大了。穿了不多時，就容易皺皮變舊。不大不小，穿着舒服，才稱合式，用起來，也可長久些。假使皮鞋着了潮，霑了濕，放在火上去烘乾，那是最錯誤最愚笨的了，要知道火的熱力，足以使皮破裂的。最好的除潮去濕方法，是用洋紗來做成兩隻小袋，袋裏裝滿糠，麩或燕麥，塞在皮鞋内，一隻皮鞋塞一隻小袋。隔了一小時許，就可發見皮鞋上的潮濕浌都被小袋中物，吸收殆盡；皮鞋乾後，把袋取出。野羔皮製的黑皮鞋，在初次　見皺皮變舊的時候，趕快補救，便可恢復原狀。補救的方法，是把一份的阿列布油Ｓｗｅｅｔｏｉｌ，和兩份的黑墨水，混合起來，用一塊海绵，吸收了這種混合物，塗在皮鞋上，隔了幾小時後，照平常的方法來擦，擦後，皮鞋就煥然一新了。欲使黑皮鞋光澤明亮，祇要在鼓皮鞋油中，加少許牛乳，一同揩擦，非但可使黑皮光彩鮮明，而且可使皮不易破裂，還可以使黑色保持長久咧。假使皮鞋上有了汚點，在除去的時候，要先從汚點的外圈除起，然後向中心轉圍圈地揩除；否則皮鞋上難免永遠留着一個白色的汚圈兒，是很不雅觀的。</p>

<p>— 記高明</p>
<p>（怒吼吧，中國！）這齣觀，目前在上海正流行着。至於我看這齣戲，則是四五年前的某夜在日本東京（本鄉）劇塲。</p>
<p>那夜共演兩齣戲，一齣是江口渙的（鴉片戰爭），一齣便是（怒吼吧，中國！）。演出者是　地劇團；那時這有名的劇團正當内部分裂以後，所以這一夜的表演，確實足稱（力演）而無愧。</p>
<p>觀衆很多，差不多賣了滿痤。因爲是新興劇團演新戲劇，所以制服和便衣的警察來了不少。</p>
<p>幕被觀衆的熱烈的情緒所衝開，（鴉片戰爭）開始被展演於我們面前。這齣戲，後來改名（最初的歐羅巴之旗），是已由某君譯成中文了的。演員的說白說得太快，也許是過於努力了吧，以致一般人很難聽懂。觀衆不斷地狂呼··（說清楚些！）（不能說清楚些嗎？）到後來，才總算安靜了。這部灰色的沉悶的戲劇很順當地在没有特色之中在無臺上展開，在没有特色之中閉幕。</p>
<p>休息。</p>
<p>幕第一次開了。（怒吼吧，中國！豋場了。觀衆重新抖起精神，把視繳集注於無臺。外國兵艦，碼頭｀｀｀｀。隨着戲劇在無臺上一幕幕地進行，觀衆的情緒漸漸變得活潑起來。看起來，這些觀衆像是都關心！或者甚至同情！着中國。戲臺上演到帝國主義者壓迫或侮辱中國工人處，警察們便拍起手來，而一些觀衆便報以（混蛋！）的呵叱。的確，卽使在這裏，鬭爭也在我們面前被續行着。演到碼頭上槍斃中國工人的地方，那些嗜血的警察們重新拍起手來，而觀衆又毫不躊躇地報以（畜生！）的激情的毒駡。而在這當兒，我看見坐在我右邊的一位中產階級模樣的日本姑娘低下頭來，用手掩住了眼睛。哦，心地純良的可敬愛的隣邦姑娘喲，你可注意到一個支那少年在燈光（黑的當兒暗暗擦了感激的涙？</p>
<p>總之在這一夜，我除了看舞臺上的戲之外，還看到了更眞切更有意義的舞臺下的戲。在最後一個（幕合），坐在我左邊的一個日本學生同我攀談，我問他對於今夜的戲的感想？，他說··（比起（鴉片戰爭）來，（怒吼吧，中國！裏的中國當然有希望得多了。你以爲呢？我說··（但是卽使是（怒吼吧，中國！），也不過是表現了曙光期的新興中國而已。眼前的中國，是站在更前進了的階段上。你以爲怎樣？</p>
<h3 id="c306">烟草與鴉片 <a href="#c306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>鴉片自何時何地輸入中國，至何時流毒始盛，吾人旣知之矣。惟烟草是否中國原產，抑由他國輸入，又何時始成國人嗜好，亦吾人所欲知之事也。</p>
<p>按烟草與鴉片在歷史上原有結合之關係。當滿清政府第一次禁止吸販鴉片，時在雍正七年。禁令旣布，福建巡撫劉世明奏稱；漳州府知府李國治，拿得行户陳遠私販鴉片三十四斤，業經擬以軍罪。及臣提案親訊，則據陳遠供稱鴉片原係藥材，與害人之鴉片烟並非同物。當傳藥商認騐，僉稱此係藥材，爲治痢必需之品，並不能害人。惟加入烟草同熬，始成鴉片烟，李國治妄以鴉片爲鴉片烟，其屬乖謬，應照故入人罪例，具本題參。吾人生於今時，聞鴉片與鴉片烟並非同物，不免發笑，其在晝日，容有此異同。所謂加入烟草同熬，始成鴉片烟，諒係事實也。</p>
<p>頃從聚仁先生借得國學論業，中有鄭宗棨先生（鴉片之源流）一文，考證精𧸸。其述及烟草與鴉片之關係，亦殊有趣。略謂烟草原產於美州西印度地方，經西班牙人手而傳諸斐力賓羣鳥，明末，復由該羣島傳入福建地方。此物一入中國，忽流行士女老幼間，崇禎十二年嚴禁之而竟不止。不啻中國本部也，即當時滿洲，吸烟之風亦甚盛。崇德三年（崇禎十一年）已嚴頒（出境貨買烟草禁條。）同六年，更嚴令禁烟，然滿人亦復不能自休。事有凑巧，英國Ｊａｍｅｓ第一嘗勸誘民衆戒烟而未果，蓋亦當明末時期也。要之，自明末，即當西歷十七世紀之初，吸烟之風已披靡中國。同世紀晚年，旅行波斯南洋羣島，日本等處之Ｋａｅｍｆｅｒ言；波斯人因感烟草之毒質，及不快性，故創水管吸烟法，波斯人以此法傳於牽得斯丹之阿刺伯人，牽得人傳播之於印度洋及南洋羣島土人間，由是爪哇之巴達維亞Ｂａｔａｖｉａ亦盛行水管吸烟之風。尋微放烟片於水中，俾調溶而吸烟，遂開鴉片與烟草混吸之惡習焉。然明末清初時，爪哇臺灣之間，常常往來貿易，而此等吸烟風習漸次傳入臺灣。當時正鄭成功占領臺灣之前後，國人不乏往來臺灣者，以竹管或金屬管通過鴉片水中吸烟法，大抵傳自爪哇臺灣，溯其源流，實創自波斯人也。</p>

<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>中國人的國民性，似乎特别喜歡抄捷徑。明明有一條寛闊的大路擺在他面前，他却不肯走，一定要去探訪一下，有没有另外一條偏僻快捷的小路，可以早一些抄到目的地。要是有的話，那麽，縱使攀籘附葛，翻山越嶺，也一無懊悔。</p>
<p>爲上貪圖這一些兒簡捷，情願使身體上受足了痛苦，中國人這一種出世精神，是很足佩服的。</p>
<p>這證之歷史上，也是（自古已然）。兵家相爭，操勝利之權者，常是那些能從小路抄到敵人後面，迅雷不及掩耳，使敵人措手不及，殺得個大敗虧輸的人。所以陳倉暗渡，終立漢家四百年之基業：而陰平偷縋，亦建鄧艾滅蜀之殊勳。鳴乎！抄捷徑之功，豈不偉哉！</p>
<p>降至今日，中國人抄捷徑的愈多，而功夫也愈臻上乘，簡直已經達到爐火純青之候了。讀書人不肯安分守已的弄筆頭，一定要拍賣人格，把頭皮削尖了去鑽個官做。無他，抄捷徑也。經商人不肯安分守已的做生意，一定要買空賣空，到金業交易所裏去做他幾百兩標金。無他，亦抄捷徑也。</p>
<p>雖然抄捷徑大有成功之望，然而這捷徑却是很難走的。正如攀籘附葛翻山越嶺一樣，只要足下偶不留心，便立刻會一個公栽葱，從千仭高山顚躓入萬丈深淵。讀書人抄捷徑去鑽營做官，一旦政局變遷，樹倒猢猻散，便要弄得文不能測字，武不能當兵。經商人抄捷徑去做標金，一旦美國廢止金本位，金價暴跌，便不免要呑鴉片，投黄浦。</p>
<p>但是，時時瞧見有人從捷徑上顚躓下來，却又時時瞧見有人在抄捷徑。而且，舊的抄捷徑的人顚躓了，新的抄捷徑的人更多。甚矣！中國人抄捷徑的精神之可佩也！</p>

<p>— 程雲萍</p>
<p>他人都在那裏升官發財，自已却一輩子窮愁潦倒，心裏自然不免有點感慨。　　　　　　　　　的，憤懣上不憤懣，而貧困就彷佛是你註定了的運命。於是，有些人　果然相信了命定論。旣然功名富貴，都是前生定的，自身貧困，不必憂愁，他人威風，也就不用眼熱。而另一方面，還可以表示他人地位超於我，並非我的本領不如人。因這都是運命註定的。</p>
<p>但是，爲什麽我就偏有這苦命？這似乎又有點有失體面了。然而聰明人馬上又想出方法來說··窮苦無妨，要這樣纔是清高！這實在有點舉世汚濁，惟我獨清的超階級的樣子。也就是貧困的人第二個自慰的方法。我曾做了五年鄉村小學敎師，現在仍操着這種職業。我覺得這種職業雖不怎樣卑汚，却也不見得如何高尙，但每逢同樣相談，感嘆着這職業的因苦時，人總是說··除了清高兩字以外，這職業眞没有可以使人貪圖的地方。我不懂每天敎孩子認點字，拿人家十幾塊錢一個月的這種職業，爲什麽就特别清高？　　清高任你貪圖，而事實上你仍然是貧困，要借點錢時，還許你清不得，高不成。於是有人又引用了孟夫子的話··天之將降大任於斯人也，必先勞期筋骨，餓其體膚｀｀｀｀｀（慚愧我枉讀聖人書，這句話不知寫錯了没有？彷佛現在貧困，正是將來幸福的必經過程，遙想未來，悠哉悠哉。豈只足以自慰？還不妨可以自豪！</p>
<p>這便是窮人自已的精神安慰法。無數的窮人大這裏生長，享樂，死亡。</p>
<p>其實，命定論者只不過是顯示了自已可鄙的怯弱··自謚清高的也是愚笨得可笑可憐。至於第三者，引用的是聖賢之言，似乎不能說他無理。但終日勞動，餓着肚子的人有成千成萬，爲什麽過去不少的奴隸就在鞭笞下終結了一生？能明白將降的是什麽大任，如何去切實負起這將降的大任，人纔有把自已從貧困的境地裏救出來的希望！</p>
<h3 id="c309">老祖母 <a href="#c309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>在所有的最近的青年小說家中，徐轉蓬先生是我最喜歡的一個，雖然他發表的作品並不多，而似乎也還没有出過風頭。在本月份的（大陸）雜誌上，又豋了他這篇新作（老祖母）。這是一篇只有四千多字的短篇小說，但它是藝術的東西。題材也很簡單，是這樣的··一個鄉間的並不富有的家庭，有着一個老祖母，據說快活到一百歲了。可是她的食量，在媳婦的眼裏，是比一個壯漢還吃得多。於是媳婦駡這個老東西，是直腸的，餓着她。老祖母，哭着，閙着，咒駡着，就是兒子聽到了也覺得（老年人的哭是多餘的）。兒子和媳婦到由地裏去作工，留下孫女看家，把一切可吃的東西，或是（藏在鬼也找不到的地方），或是（高高地掛在鈎子上）。老祖母央告孫女，孫女怎麽也不講，這是那父母的敎育的成功。一天，老祖母餓急了，要到縣裏告這對忤逆的兒子和媳婦，於是她（用着蝸牛爬行的速度，在村外松林中的小路上走），可是在路上，有人告訴她··（如今世界變了，縣官不管這類事了，人們也看不起老太婆了｀｀｀｀｀）</p>
<p>（那末，她立刻嚎啕大哭，她咀咒世界，也咀咒縣官｀｀｀｀｀她在路旁坐下來了··不到縣裏去，也不回家，她哭泣着，咀咒着，過路的人勸她也不管，天響雷也不管，大滴的陣頭雨打着，她還坐在路旁｀｀｀｀｀）直到第二天的傍晚，這個老祖母還是没有動地方，但終歸是被人送回家裏來，病倒在床上了。當老祖母已經斷了氣的時候，一兒子和媳婦偷偷的走到老祖母房外探聽，毫無聲響。然後，特地呌孫女到老祖母的床前，掀開帳子探望）。</p>
<p>據（受以極度驚惶孫女）的口吃的報告··（祖母没有死，没有死！那怕人的眼睛｀｀｀｀｀｀）這時媳婦正在廚下切菜，菜刀鏗鏘的落到木凳上。（我猜中了，她一時不會死的！她要活到一百歲｀｀｀｀｀）</p>
<p>就這樣結尾了這篇小說。在其中我最初看到了精美的藝術，如柴霍甫和莫泊桑那樣才幹家製作短篇小說的藝術。他的簡潔的文章風格，他的精練的技巧，他的人物對話的適當，他的人物的眞實，都完全像是出自一個藝術大家的手筆。就是在這樣只有完全同情於那老祖母的題材裏，我們的作者都没有陷於傷感的或羅曼蒂克的同。情他以着非常節省的幾筆，就充份地顯示出一個老人的嘮叨和麻煩。那個媳婦好像是一個純粹的惡婆娘，但我們也不覺得她是誇張的。當隣居的老太婆以老祖母就快死了的理由勸她好好地服侍她的時候，作者使這個媳婦說··（不，她要活到一百歲，她的食量和青年人一樣｀｀｀｀｀她如果生在有錢的人家，她有福了。就有許多親戚朋友，替她拜壽｀｀｀｀｀但是，我家裏大窮了，小孩子也整天挨餓啦｀｀｀｀｀｀）　　這話顯然是這位媳婦的惡行的理由，或社會的根據，但這話也同樣是欺騙的藉口。第一我們要知道，這故事，這人物，只有在如中國這樣殘存的　　的社會裏，才有可能的事實。這個老祖母，這個媳婦，以及其整個的家族，完全是封建社會的產物，例如這媳婦，不只是普通的自私，而更是很毒了，但這種很毒是的封建社會受着經濟壓迫的特殊的現象。</p>
<p>生長在中國封建社會裏的人，像（媳婦）的這種人形，時常會看得到的，就是當她們的生活並不感到經濟壓迫的時候，她們對於她們的眼中釘的很毒也同樣要表現着，容或那表現的方式是不同的。我曾經親眼看見過資本家的家族的媳婦，對於一個九十五歲的（老祖母）演着類似這故事的很毒的事。</p>
<p>我們的社會，極大部份還是存着濃厚的封建的勢力，生長在其中的人物的面像，如果時代一過，他們也許就不會使人相信了。但，無論如何，他們也是時代和社會的構成的份子，我們需要把他們紀錄下來，這工作，在文學上，並不見得不重要。所以，我特地在這裏祈福這位（老祖母）的青年作家！</p>

<h3 id="c310">也來談文憑 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>近來本刊上關於（文憑）的話，實在是談得夠起勁了。我在旁邊看着熱閙，今天覺得喉頭癢癢地也想來參加說幾句話··</p>
<p>文憑委實有最大的魔力，据說它能解决人的生活問題，（求學與職業的問題，甚至於戀愛問題也有因它而得圓滿解决的）那末可想它眞是一件偉大的東西了。</p>
<p>聽說近幾年學校裏對於（文憑）是很嚴格地檢查着。近來看見Ｘ大學的簡章上，這樣的寫着··（凡投考本校各學院各科各年級新生，繳來之文憑本校均於錄取後向原校調查如有僞造頂替塗改情弊，一經查出，立予退學處分······）這樣一來·對於（文憑）的價格更提高了，以重價去出賣或收買的，當不不乏其人了。而小資產階級的子弟，甘心在大學裏去混過四年，目的也就是爲着去買一張萬能的（文憑）。我們翻開Ｘ報的聘請樣裏，很觸目的也可以看見··（本公司欲請ＸＸ員一位，需大學畢業，薪金從豐，請隨带畢業證書來ＸＸ接洽）。</p>
<p>因素有入大學念書的志願，可是高中不曾正式畢過業，高中的文憑無從撈獲，因此随你自已孜孜不倦地自修着，預備去嘗嘗大學生的滋味，可是事實上，是被列於擯棄之伍；所以注重文憑的結果，使無限的好學而未曾得到畢業文憑，而欲完全最後學程的青年，祇有擯棄在大學校門之外，只有感覺望洋興嘆了。</p>
<p>啊！社會的人士，最這樣的注重（文憑），學校當局，又是這樣重視（文憑），那更何况其餘的人呢？然而這究竟是一個不可解的謎呀！</p>
<p>在一册小說裏，我曾經讀過這樣幾句話··（｀｀｀｀｀｀爲了一張文憑，而文憑便是資格，便是證明你已經化過多少資本，已經買來多少知識··證明你有某種的辦事能力。可是我們這社會郤又矛盾得利害。一方面要求資格，另一方面，有飯吃的人們大都没有文憑，没有和那文憑相副的辦事能力｀｀｀｀｀）因此，我也時常想··文憑不過是一張紙兒，是否貨眞價實，總不會是無理由的重視和固執的信仰所能夠决定的。</p>
<h3 id="c311">秋 <a href="#c311" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e311" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">311</a></h3>
<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>大陽跌在西山邊，那樣地昏黄而無力，把那西山上的樹木模糊得使人看不清楚，一陣陣的風吹着，更把那樹木吹得飄搖不定，寥遠的天空，已慢慢的暗合攏來，在打麥塲上，亦不見農家的晚餐，這是肅煞的一年的秋季，也是農夫唯一希望所在的秋季。</p>
<p>阿狗，在這西山鎭上，也可算是個殷實的農夫，他種着陸田主的近百畝田，有二條牛，家裏僱着長工，阿狗在西山鎭是被稱爲田財主的。但是去年的新穀上市，穀價特别的低賤，在一般普通農夫忍痛將一年的血汗賤賣出去的時候，阿狗仗着自已的根底堅固，而且經騐告訴他新穀上市的時候總不及來春的上價，即使借貸上當來償還倉租，一兩個月的利息，一定可以在下一年春初上價的時候獲利而有餘。阿狗依照年常舊規，將自已的新穀囤積起來，出了二分錢的利息借來七百塊錢，在頭限（鄉間田主開倉收租後，以十日爲一限，逾限加五升。如八成還租的，在頭限之内，每石歸租八斗，逾限即爲八斗五升，以此類推。）之内歸清了倉間，他就優遊的做他的好夢。每日拖了他的旱煙袋上鎭上的小茶館打聽穀價，年底漸漸的逼近，穀價確比上市時漲了五角，阿狗計算着開春能漲上一塊錢，他就能有七八十元的進欵，他計算着還是每天上茶館，當爐子的伙計得尊他一聲阿狗爹，也可見阿狗在西山鎭上的顯赫一時了。</p>
<p>爆竹一聲除舊，桃符萬象更新，人家走過阿狗爹門口的時，他已凝上陸秀才寫的春聯，這是他每年的常例，過一個年總是像像樣樣的，化這末十頭二十塊錢；然而他的好夢末圓，厄運却來叩他貼着春聯的門了。</p>
<p>大年初四阿狗爹就拖着他的旱煙袋上茶館去，當爐子的小伙計向他喊恭喜發財，阿狗爹皺着多紋的臉說··（小伙計，你發財！償了一個紅封的紙包，一塊雪一般的大洋錢，從此就不見阿狗爹的笑臉，穀價也是一天一天的低賤，跌進了去年新穀上市的價格。到桃花怒放的清明時節，各方催債的漸漸逼緊，阿狗爹囤積着的百多擔穀賣出去後，他的牛欄裏同時走失了兩條牛。阿狗爹的尊稱在西山鎭雖然還是存在着，但是漸漸地含着諷刺的意義了··至少，在阿狗自已聽來。</p>
<p>人類的希望是永遠没有完盡的時候，自然，阿狗爹的希望也永遠無盡期。兩條牛，一個豐收，就乖乖地牽回牛欄來了，雖然他的多紋的臉上不再展露着笑容，可是他更努力耕種了。他的全部希望他額上的汗滴中掛下來。</p>
<p>黄鶯在樹上頭呌着的春天，阿狗爹的手臂代替着牛的腿翻鬆田土；蟬聲聒噪着的夏天，阿狗爹的兩條腿浸在毒熱的田水中耘稻。他自朝至暮，全部的生命力交託了陸田主的近百畝田，就是他的全部希望變成了汗滴從額上掛下來。　　天旱，他打着水車，像去年時候的兩條牛一樣，接連下了幾天雨，他放水，像去年時候的兩條牛一樣；可是他的希望终於全部破產，颶風連着的來，稻，被全根掘去的也有，折腰的也有，就是傾斜着苟延殘喘的，也不及半數了。</p>
<p>氣候已到也秋天，正是秋收的時候。西山鎭上不及阿狗爹的佃農，已像没有靈魂的木偶一樣。（到農村去）你們喊着的時候曾否想到農村的境况而患一加援手？</p>

<p>啊！眞的，秋深了，摩登的（少爺）除了西裝革履以外，多加了一件夾大衣，同樣的時代化的摩登（小姐）也穿上嶄新的一九三四年代的夾大衣，其實光加上了這輕薄的一件有什麽意思呀！點綴着秋之來臨，迎合着時代的浪化吧！</p>

<p>行將出閣的小姐陡然病了，而且說病得很重··最顯著的是整日價躺着不下床，其次呢，便是食量大減，飯，簡直有兩整日不曾吃了。</p>
<p>娘着手慌中一面趕急倩人去通報　家，一面自已就親上觀音廟去。</p>
<p>躺在床上的小姐，暗喜不勝！憑良心說··病是假的，是裝做的，爲的是夫　家催娶得那麽厲害，娘也掉面扮嘴，閒話多着，伊打量又打量，眞苦於找不着適宜的對策，所以只好裝病。病旣裝成了，若是娘馬上就去呌醫生，或通報在Ｘ埠的爹，爹也就會跟醫生一道同來。這，葫蘆是否有藥，藥又屬於何種，是不難給那些鬼醫生一語破謎。</p>
<p>果然娘問了神轉來，說是有菩蕯作怪，務要請法師設壇祈禱，必要時，還不免要許願打醮，娘嘟着嘴說··（請法師，許愿打醮，都可以的！只是這屋宇怎麽這樣住不興人，四向的風水也好，朝對也好，房子也就用。｜｜先是爹總不交運，謀不到差事，去年小毛出一天花）原是那麽平平的傷風，也竟就	｀｀｀｀｀唉！現在你又病了，這怎麽得了？）言下似不勝感傷，最是小毛之死，死得娘有些心悸。</p>
<p>小姐聽了，蕴着在心底笑，面孔却表現得氣急氣呆的，娘也就去凖備信神的一套了。</p>
<p>壻家呢，自這消息傳過去，只說病要認眞的診，小姐想··不診怎麽樣，該不會我　在床上，也會拿彩轎來迎接吧！側着耳，聽見娘在門外與間壁的徐媽在細談什麽，模模糊糊，彷佛是這麽套調兒··</p>
<p>（眞不得了，外面的閒言日看日多起來了，自已不害羞，我倒難爲情煞了！擇定日子　，却又害起病來，簡直是寃氣！）是娘的聲音。</p>

<p>（是的！謝謝你的關顧！｜｜唉，偏偏病了，還得趕快爲她信神啦！）</p>
<p>（哽，哽，哽，）小姐在床上有意的作着乾咳聲，意思是說伊已聽着了她們的話。</p>
<p>小姐的病。畢竟被在Ｘ埠的爹知道了，兼程走了回來，給伊請來位名醫診斷，名醫看了没有說什麽，顯然是没有看出病的究竟，醫方是隨便一個兒，藥煎好，供上小姐的榻前，小姐背着人家的眼，便把牠倒在榻下，小姐的病，畢竟醫藥是無效，娘嘟着嘴，爹也没有辦法，就隨娘去信神許愿。</p>
<p>壻家聽得小姐病得更嚴重了的消息，說要接過去診，小姐只在被窩裏蹬榻板，爹也說這究竟不便，不能答允。</p>
<p>結果是壻家來訊··迎娶展期，娘也　請法師做過了祈禱，打了醮，還在觀帝老爺的神像前許了逢月初一十五奉點油燈三年，小姐的病便了旦霍然了，娘在爹前誇着偉功，小姐在房裏看着老媽子從學校裏取回的一厚疊的桃紅色祇的信</p>

<p>Demanding Overseas Travel Expenses and Status</p>
<p>Personally Arrived at Li Xingcun's Division Headquarters in Fengjia Camp Yesterday</p>
<p>Met with Shang Zhen, Xu Tingyao, and Guan Linzheng</p>
<p>Terms Agreed Upon, Immediately Took a Car to Tianjin</p>
<p>Remnants of the Troops Near Shunyi Awaiting Reorganization</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji, due to the persuasion of representatives from the Ping Charity Organizations and Shang Zhen, Tu Zhongfu, and a final warning issued daily, was given a deadline of 3 PM on the 16th to withdraw from the war zone. At 2:30 PM, he led over ten staff members to Li Xingcun's Division Headquarters in Fengjia Camp to meet with Shang Zhen, Xu Tingyao, Guan Linzheng, and others. Fang Ji proposed (1) a request for generous severance pay for his 200+ guards to be discharged, (2) a request for the state to reorganize his troops, (3) a hope that the government would provide him with a status and travel expenses to leave the army and travel overseas. Shang Zhen immediately consulted He through telephone. The results: (1) Fang Ji's guards were immediately given 5,000 yuan to purchase plain clothes and be discharged, (2) Fang Ji's entire army was temporarily led by his army commander, Li Dexin, to await reorganization in Dulinzhuang, (3) Fang Ji's safety would be guaranteed after leaving the army, and the issue of travel expenses and status would be answered after consulting with the central government. Before a reply was received, Shang Zhen and representatives from the charity organizations would provide guarantees. At 4:30 PM, Fang Ji, accompanied by over ten staff members, took a car to Tianjin and resided at his residence in the French Concession. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin discussed the aftermath of Fang Ji's troops with Xu Shang and others at midnight on the 16th. According to Fang Ji, whom reporters met in Fengjia Camp, "I am useless and cannot do anything for the country, I am sorry to the people. My over ten thousand troops are awaiting reorganization." He appeared quite uneasy. Fang Ji's attitude was natural. According to him, "I intend to go with Fang and plan to go to Cuba and the United States for investigation in the future. I have already notified the Japanese side to stop bombing Fang Ji." (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin's telegram roughly stated: "Fang Ji's disturbance was suppressed by the national army, and he was exhausted and surrendered at the front. The troops are being relocated. This chairman upholds the central government's intention of leniency and allows him to leave. The measures for dealing with Fang Ji's troops were agreed upon by Shang Xu and others at midnight: (1) Fang Ji's troops will pass through Ping unarmed for training in Bao; (2) Each person who turns in a gun and a horse will be given five yuan; (3) Those willing to serve in the national army will be allowed to do so; (4) Guns will be issued after training in Bao is completed. Procedures will begin on the 17th." (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji's troops are currently concentrated in the vicinity of Shunyi, including Dongzhuang, Luogezhuang, Qianhoushayu, Matouzhuang, and Donggezhuang, with Mi Wenhe responsible for contacting them for reorganization. Fang Zhenwu telegraphed his resignation on the evening of the 16th and requested Xu Tingyao to telegraph Chiang Kai-shek not to hold him accountable for the past. He Yingqin also issued a telegram at midnight, reporting the resolution of the Fang Ji issue. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu, due to exhaustion and diminishing strength, decided to leave the army. He departed from Dulinzhuang for Beiping this morning and is expected to arrive at a certain place outside Dongzhimen tonight. Shang Zhen left the city by car at 5 PM this evening to bring Fang Ji into the city. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen, accompanied by his staff adjutant and entourage, departed by several cars at 2:10 PM this afternoon for a certain place on the front line in Shunyi, intending to invite Fang Ji to meet. If Fang Ji wishes to leave the army, he can come to Beiping with Shang Zhen. As of 8 PM tonight, Shang Zhen had not yet returned to the city. After Fang Ji was captured, it was rumored that he had escaped again. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Beiping, Major Tanimoto of the Guqi detachment, stationed near Sunjia Town in Shunyi, reported that Fang Zhenwu led approximately 20 staff members to the headquarters of the 142nd Division of the Central Army in Fengjia Camp at 2 PM this afternoon, expressing unconditional surrender. Shang Zhen and the commanders of the 142nd and 25th Divisions met with Fang Zhenwu in Sunjia Town to discuss the aftermath. Thus, the Fang Zhenwu issue is completely resolved. It is also rumored that Ji Hongchang, due to the annihilation of his subordinates, escaped in a car from the vicinity of Shunyi to the north and will also surrender as a result.

<p>(Beiping) To drive Fang Ji out of the war zone, the Japanese army resumed shelling Fang's positions with over twenty shells this afternoon. After being suppressed, over 400 men from Fang's troops fled to the front of our military defense line, requesting to surrender. Procedures for disarming are currently underway. Moreover, after Fang Ji's remnants entrenched themselves in Dong and Xi Dulinzhuang, Dong and Xi Haihong, Beifaxin, and Jiaojiazhuang, Dajiangzhuang area, the national army immediately set up a tight defense in the vicinity of Shunyi, Shimen Village, and Liujiahe to prevent them from fleeing south and to block them head-on. It was also reported that the Japanese army had transferred a part of its infantry and artillery from outside Gubeikou and deployed them in the Yamen Village and Nihe areas to prevent them from fleeing east. Until the 16th, Fang Ji, seeing that the situation was hopeless and there was no way to advance, secretly escaped. When he passed through the national army's defense line, he was captured by a sentry. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The remnants of Fang Ji's troops once attacked Shunyi County to the west, but failed due to the effective defense of the garrison troops and retreated to Dulinzhuang. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Manziying telephoned at 10:30 AM today that Fang Ji's remnants launched an attack on Shunyi County at 1 AM last night.

<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Fang Ji convened a military conference in Baixiangyang Village yesterday, deciding on four points: (1) not to leave the army after surrendering, (2) to negotiate surrender, but if there are no results, to attack Shunyi County, (3) not to force subordinates who have divided loyalties to stay, (4) to send personnel to Tianjin to meet with Shi Yousan. Fang sent his chief of staff, Zhang, to Ping with a personal letter, intending to forward it to Tianjin, but he was captured by the national army yesterday.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Seeing that the subordinates have fled almost completely and the situation is hopeless, Fang's troops specially sent their false division commanders Zhu Wenhe, Wang Xinde, and Wang Ying to contact our army to surrender, claiming that as long as Fang Ji's life can be preserved, Fang Ji can also personally come to negotiate, etc. Negotiations are currently underway. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a public telegram from the Beiping military attaché's office to the Ministry of the Army, the Saeda unit of the Kwantung Army, which was pursuing Fang Ji's allied forces and advancing south, has reached the villages of Yamen Village and Zhujiapu, the southernmost end of the agreed-upon line. They have been launching fierce attacks from land and air for days on Fang Ji's army, which is trapped in the area of the East and West Sea Bins and Dulinzhuang, eleven to three kilometers south of them. Furthermore, Shang Zhen's army is surrounding Fang Ji's army to the south, and Fang Ji's army is like a rat in a bag. It is only a matter of days before they are completely wiped out. Moreover, many of Fang Ji's troops are fleeing towards Shunyi and the Western Hills of Beiping. (16th Electric Communiqué)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: According to the people and Fang's deserters who escaped from the front, Fang, seeing that he was surrounded on all sides and there was no gap to take advantage of, and that supplies and equipment were lacking and the soldiers' hearts were scattered, knew that the situation was hopeless. This morning, he summoned his subordinates and gave a speech, roughly saying, "Everyone has followed me for many days and experienced many hardships. The current environment is harsh, and we are in a dilemma. The future outcome is difficult to predict. Those who want to stay can continue to follow me, and those who do not want to stay can hand in their guns and find their own way. I will never force anyone." It is said that since Fang gave this speech, most of his troops have dispersed. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This evening's communiqué stated that Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang clearly knew that the situation was hopeless, so they disguised themselves this morning and left their troops in the non-war zone, hoping to cross the government army's front line, but they were captured by a patrol team and were taken to outside Beiping City tonight. It is said that their personal safety will be guaranteed and they will be taken into the city tomorrow. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Current Commentary: International Trends After Germany's Withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Germany's demand for equality in armaments has long been a reef in European politics. Today, with a sudden thunderclap, it has announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. From now on, not only will the disputes between Germany and France become more incomprehensible, but the Second World War is already imminent.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the resumption of the Disarmament Conference, the conflicting interests of various countries were already very intense. In particular, the issue of equality in armaments between Germany and France was even more serious. In order to implement its foreign policy, the German National Socialist Party firmly advocated equality in armaments. This not only aroused extreme resentment from France, the pioneer of the Treaty of Versailles, but also made Italy, which spiritually gave Germany some sympathy, very uneasy. In this environment, Germany saw that its demand for equality in armaments was difficult to implement, so it decided to throw a huge bomb and formally declared its withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference on the 14th of this month. In terms of the general political and economic situation in the world today, politics are mutually opposed and crises are lurking everywhere, while the economy is advocating alliances and panic is increasing day by day. Germany's sudden move to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations is of course shocking to the world. The urgent preparations to strengthen France's military aspects, the vigorous promotion of Italian fascism, and the shaking of Britain's traditional policy of using the opposition between the two powers are inevitable. If we only look at the general situation to judge right and wrong, Germany's demand for equality in armaments is for the purpose of self-defense, which is not inappropriate. It is also in line with the traditional habits of the Germanic nation. However, from another perspective, France's fear of Germany has not been eliminated, so its advocacy of maintaining the Treaty of Versailles and insisting on its so-called security guarantees also has its own appropriate explanation. Britain's sympathy for Germany is only to limit France's excessive power, and its unwillingness to see Germany's rapid progress is also very obvious. The fact that Britain has sided with French diplomacy in recent months is sufficient evidence. As for Italy, although it is also a fascist country and sympathizes with revising the Treaty of Versailles, fascism originally takes national supremacy as its ultimate goal. In terms of situation and reason, it cannot be coordinated with any other country. Moreover, Italy's intention to revise the treaty is very different from Germany's, so its sympathy for the German movement has a certain limit. If this limit is exceeded, it will inevitably turn from friend to enemy. The Soviet Union was originally in another category, standing outside the disputes of Central European countries. It would not have been difficult for Germany to use diplomatic means to restrain Britain and France with the help of the Soviet Union. Moreover, most of the machinery and other manufactured goods in the Soviet Union's five-year plan were imported from Germany. However, since the implementation of the National Socialist Party's so-called national policy, Soviet commercial purchases have turned to others. Soviet personnel in Germany have also been dismissed recently. A clear rift has emerged between Germany and the Soviet Union politically, and it is also difficult to maintain the previous good relations economically. At the same time, France and the Soviet Union and Italy and the Soviet Union are becoming closer, which shows that Germany is in a state of isolation.</p>
<p>Germany's poverty is known to the world. At the beginning of the National Socialist Party's rule, its domestic economic policy still followed the old path of Papen, leaning towards state capitalism. This is a fact that is generally known. It is in the cards that it is difficult to implement and cannot escape the control of financial capital. Since Hugenberg's resignation and the appointment of Schmidt, the president of the life insurance company, as Minister of Economy and Agriculture, he has publicly stated that the German economy is no different from before. The National Socialist Party headquarters has also issued a notice to abandon the nationalization policy of department stores and prohibit its members from violent acts against department stores. From this, it can be seen that the German National Socialist Party is gradually unable to implement its domestic economic policy, and the emotional state of the general public cannot be calmed down. Therefore, the first step is to vent its anger by attacking the Jews, followed by withdrawing from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference to arouse the temporary excitement of the people. In international relations, it has received unprecedented stimulation. As a result of this kind of excitement and stimulation, the dying Disarmament Conference may even promote another kind of powerful alliance, which may turn into a new situation.</p>
<p>After Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, it showed its determination to demand equality in armaments in spirit. In fact, it promoted the military industry to overcome economic difficulties. Its suspicion of expanding armaments cannot be avoided. In this situation, France will inevitably urgently seek to consolidate its leading hegemony in continental Europe. The way to consolidate hegemony is to use the economy as the main force for the small countries of Central Europe. For the German problem, it must expand its armaments under the pretext of security guarantees. At the same time, it will use diplomacy to bring Austria-Hungary under its control, reach an understanding with the Soviet Union, and at least maintain a neutral attitude from Italy. Britain will also be friendly to France in this case. In this emergency period, the patriotic feelings of the Germans will inevitably burn fiercely. The actions of various countries to secretly expand armaments will change into open competition. This is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire. The final result is inevitably a bad war, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Japan has never established naval air squadrons in various key ports. This time, the military command ordered that air units should not be temporarily established in Maizuru, Jinhae, and Magong, but that they should be added to Minato (Aomori Prefecture) and Lushun. It was decided to implement this starting November 1. Yoshihara Shunichi, a naval commander, was also appointed as the air commander of the two ports. It is also said that an air squadron will also be added to Saeki County in Oita Prefecture. (16th Japan United Electric)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Japanese Army Ministry Announces Soviet Russia's Military Strength: Hundreds of Aircraft Can Bomb Tokyo Directly; The Purpose of This Propaganda is to Realize the Ambition of Expanding Armaments; And Says That Once War Breaks Out Against Russia, Japan Has Gained US Understanding <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry recently announced the strength of Soviet Russia's military, pointing out that it is a major threat to Japan. It is claimed that Soviet Russia's peacetime military has 1.29 million soldiers with sophisticated machinery and ample supplies, forming a total of 75 infantry divisions and 13 cavalry divisions, with 2,500 aircraft, 1,500 tanks, countless armored vehicles, and one large chemical warfare unit. Due to the development of Soviet Russia's heavy industry in recent years, the quality and quantity of its armaments are more sophisticated than in the Tsarist era. The Soviet Russia's military strength in the Far East has increased even more. Currently, there are 10 divisions of large armies, 300 tanks, and hundreds of large bombers and other types of aircraft stationed east of Lake Baikal. If Japan and Russia were to declare war, these aircraft could immediately fly to Tokyo and bomb it, etc. As for Soviet Russia's military strength in the Far East, according to the Japanese newspaper, there are four divisions of Soviet Russia's infantry and one brigade of cavalry stationed in the Vladivostok, Shuangchengzi, and Ussuri River (Manchukuo) eastern border areas. Three infantry divisions and the remaining army and one cavalry division are stationed between Boli and Hailanpao. It is heard that each division has about 300 tanks and 350 aircraft, including 40 large bombers, which are stationed in Vladivostok and Shuangchengzi, which are closest to Japan and Korea. It is also rumored that Vladivostok currently has six of Soviet Russia's latest submarines engaged in secret activities, and six more are being installed. The Japanese Army Ministry pays even more attention to Soviet Russia's chemical warfare unit, as it believes that if Japan and Russia were to go to war, Russia, due to the inconvenience of the Siberian transportation, must devote itself to chemical warfare and aerial warfare in order to win. Therefore, if a war were to break out between Japan and Russia, chemical warfare and aerial warfare may have surprising developments, because both sides have made significant progress in this area. As for the Japanese Army Ministry's statement, it seems to be only directed at the domestic audience, attempting to reduce the opposition to the budget bill. At the same time, it can also express Japan's deep concern about the development of Soviet Russia's military. Japan has now indeed obtained the friendship and understanding of the United States, because Japan deeply fears that the United States' recognition of Soviet Russia will further consolidate Soviet Russia's position.

<h3 id="e15">The London Naval Treaty: Wakatsuki Aborts Speech <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) President Wakatsuki of the Minseito Party had originally scheduled a luncheon meeting with party members today at Fan Zhi Nei Hall to reiterate his beliefs regarding the London Treaty and the issue of supreme command. However, since the London Treaty matter had been fully addressed in his Nagoya speech, there was no need for further reiteration. He only intended to briefly address the public's criticism of the Second Naval Replenishment Plan, which they considered an improper outcome of the London Treaty's failure. It is said that Wakatsuki's speech in Nagoya stirred unexpected reactions, greatly surprising Naval Minister Osumi. To maintain control within the ministry, he consulted with Prime Minister Saito and requested Wakatsuki to cancel today's speech. The Railway Minister subsequently advised Secretary-General Matsuda of the Minseito to urge cancellation. However, the president's determination was quite firm. Colonial Minister Nagai then visited President Wakatsuki again, urging him to cancel, stating that another speech on the London Treaty would have a significant impact on naval control, causing great concern to Naval Minister Osumi, and possibly affecting the cabinet. Wakatsuki replied that he believed the treaty was necessary for the sake of the nation at the time of its signing, and that leaving behind misunderstandings for posterity was disheartening. He had long been prepared for criticism and resolved to sacrifice himself for the country. However, at this critical juncture, he did not want to burden the cabinet or cause misfortune to the nation. Therefore, despite the</p>
<p>significance, he would endure the unbearable for the sake of the country. Consequently, he cancelled the speech on the London Treaty. However, the younger members of the party expressed dissatisfaction and may raise questions or opinions at today's luncheon meeting. (Sixteenth Dispatch from Electric Communication) President of the Minseito Party's speech on the tenth of this month in Nagoya has intensified the struggle between political parties and between political parties and warlords. Senior statesmen are greatly concerned about this new situation, advising Wakatsuki not to argue right and wrong with the warlords again, and to strive for stability in the political situation. The content of Wakatsuki's speech is as follows: Recently, President Suzuki of the Seiyukai Party criticized the London Naval Treaty at its Tokai Congress, which not only concerned myself personally but also affected the prestige of our party, so I had to respond in kind. Politicians must shoulder the fate of the nation, risking their lives to handle the interests and welfare of the people, and should not flatter current trends, deceive for a moment, and seek temporary ease. As the president of a party, one becomes the prime minister when the time comes, responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, and should not lightly judge the merits and demerits of competitive shipbuilding. Suzuki's words and actions are regrettable for the future of the country and cause immense anxiety for the nation and the people. In the London Conference, Japan advocated for three points: (1) Maintaining 70% of the total tonnage of auxiliary vessels compared to the United States; (2) Maintaining 70% of large cruisers compared to the United States; (3) Maintaining 77,800 tons of submarines. The United States argued for a 10:6 ratio on the first point and also a 10:6 ratio on the second point. On the third point, the United States advocated for complete abolition. Both sides argued for their own proposals, and the naval treaty was concluded after many twists and turns. The treaty clearly stipulated that after 1936, each country could freely assert its conditions. Moreover, I made it clear that Japan was not satisfied with this treaty because the period was very short, so we accepted it. When the meeting is reopened in 1935, Japan should stand on a free position and assert Japan's demands based on its actual situation. However, as a result of the London Naval Treaty, Japan maintains 367,050 tons of auxiliary vessels, while the United States maintains 526,200 tons (a ratio of 69.9%). Regarding large cruisers, Japan has twelve ships, totaling 108,400 tons, while the United States has eighteen ships, totaling 180,000 tons. Among them, fifteen ships will be completed by 1936, and three ships cannot be completed, so one ship each will be started in 1934, 1935, and 1936. Therefore, the contrast in the amount of US and Japanese holdings by 1936 is fifteen ships of 150,000 tons for the US and twelve ships of 108,400 tons for Japan (more than 70% against the US, approximately 80%). Regarding small cruisers, Japan has 100,450 tons, while the United States has 143,500 tons (a ratio of 10:7). Regarding destroyers, Japan has 105,200 tons, while the United States has 150,000 tons (a ratio of 10:7). Regarding submarines, Japan has 52,700 tons, and the United States has 52,700 tons. Thus, regarding auxiliary vessels, large and small cruisers, and destroyers, Japan roughly achieved its claims, only failing to implement the planned principle of 77,800 tons for submarines. However, looking at the overall situation, Japan roughly realized its three claims. So the problem lies in the tonnage of submarines, which was reduced by 35,000 tons from the original plan, while the tonnage of cruisers and destroyers was increased by 25,000 tons. Which is more beneficial? The difference is very small. The goal of the London Naval Treaty was to coordinate auxiliary vessels as the main priority. There were other issues as well. The Washington Treaty resolved not to build replacements for battleships until 1931. The London Naval Treaty stipulated not to build replacements until 1936. The construction cost of one ton of battleship requires 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and the construction cost of one ship requires more than 100 million yuan. Therefore, the London Naval Treaty allows Japan to save 360 million yuan. Also, if the London Conference had broken down, international relations would have become extremely tense. For the sake of national planning, we strived to ease relations between Japan and the United States and reduce the burden on the people. Even though we were dissatisfied, signing this treaty was beneficial. I decided to report these conditions to the government and request instructions. Regarding this request, I still believe that I did this for the country and the people and have not changed my original intention. The posthumous works of Prime Minister Hamaguchi recorded my request, stating that when the Minister of the Navy went to Britain, he convened several investigative meetings with the Vice-Minister, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, and the military staff officers, and when they made their decision, they said that they had decided according to the request. Since the Navy agreed, they should do the appropriate thing, which shows that there was absolutely no infringement on the supreme command. Some say that between 1936 and 1937, Japan's holdings were less than 70% of the US, but by 1935, the year before the treaty expired, a conference had to be reopened in accordance with the treaty, at which time Japan's demands could be asserted anew. The reason for Japan's reservation lies in this. Although we want to compete equally with the US, I fear that Japan's own economic strength is insufficient. It is still unknown whether tens of millions of expenses are required. I am deeply concerned about this. By 1936, the people could reduce their burden by 400 million yuan. That is, the London Naval Treaty only reduces the burden on the people by 6 years. Suzuki believes that as a result of the London Naval Treaty, the Navy had to plan a second replenishment. However, the Navy's second replenishment plan was implemented within the scope of the naval treaty, which proves that it was not restricted by the London Naval Treaty. The reason for the replenishment plan lies not in the naval treaty but in the changes in the national situation. Today's crisis in Japan is by no means the result of the London Naval Treaty, but rather has arisen from aspects unrelated to the naval treaty. There is no need to negotiate with those who speak irresponsibly. Suzuki, who is in the position of President of the Seiyukai Party, made remarks in a public setting, and not a few believed them to be true, which can be described as extremely dangerous.

<p>(Geneva) The Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference today voted to recommend to the General Commission that the Disarmament Conference be adjourned until October 26th. It also decided to recommend that the Steering Committee reconvene on October 25th. Subsequently, it passed the draft response to Germany's note prepared by Henderson, which pointed out that Germany's withdrawal from the conference occurred precisely when the Steering Committee decided to submit a concrete plan to the General Commission, stipulating the allowance of Germany's equality proposal, and added severe criticism, stating (Your government has made this serious decision for reasons that I cannot accept as valid, which is truly regrettable). (Sixteenth Dispatch from the People's National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the major countries in the Disarmament General Commission have quickly sought to calmly consider the crisis caused by Germany's notification of withdrawal from disarmament and the League of Nations. The fact that politicians from various countries have not made any激烈 (jīliè) comments is enough to give rise to the hope that disarmament can ultimately find some kind of solution. Even the disarmament representatives showed joy at the fact that the Germans had not burned all bridges and made warlike remarks. Some politicians even believed that this move by the Germans was enough to strengthen the world's desire to maintain peace. In any case, the Disarmament Conference cannot be permanently suspended. Therefore, today's actions in Geneva include:</p>
<p>(1) Deciding that the Disarmament Conference should not be adjourned indefinitely;</p>
<p>(2) Recommending that the General Commission adjourn for a week or ten days to allow representatives time to consult with their governments and for various countries to coordinate;</p>
<p>(3) The Chairman of Disarmament, Henderson, will draft a reply to Germany's note of withdrawal, using gentle but firm language to</p>
<p>refute the German claim that various countries have a desire to humiliate Germany.</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet Union's claim that it is prepared to cooperate with any genuine disarmament effort is enough to inspire enthusiasm among the representatives. After Cecile inquired about the opinions of the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Molotov, on the current situation, Molotov replied today (When the four neighbors of the Soviet Union have not fully followed a genuine policy of peace, the Soviet government has maintained its position of peace and disarmament. Today, as all the nations of the world can truly see the threat that powerful armaments pose to peace, the Soviet Union believes that complete or at least the maximum possible disarmament is essential to eliminate this threat). Although many parties firmly believe that Germany is willing to participate in any meeting held outside of Geneva, the proposal for the disarmament representatives to go to Rome does not seem to be favored by all parties.

<h3 id="e17">Disarmament Continues; The General Commission Extends Meeting for a Short Period <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament General Commission decided to meet on Monday to discuss the draft reply prepared by Henderson and then send it to the German Foreign Ministry. It is heard that the wording of the reply will be gentle but firm. It is also heard that during the meeting of the British, Italian, French, and American representatives today, the initially drafted reply was considered too harsh, and it was decided to draft a more conciliatory one. This is because Hitler's radio broadcast speech did not contain any warlike words, so the attitude also changed accordingly. The representatives of the major countries are continuing to hold private talks. The general opinion is that the Disarmament Conference will continue until all issues can be resolved. (Fifteenth Dispatch from the People's National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) As a result of the meeting held here tonight by the representatives of Britain, France, the United States, Czechoslovakia, and Greece, Henderson will be requested tomorrow to have the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference hold a short-term extension of the meeting, approximately for one week, so that the governments of various countries can study the situation caused by Germany's withdrawal. However, since most of the major representatives will leave here after the meeting on Monday, it is still doubtful whether a serious meeting can be held after one week. Tonight's decision is a kind of compromise, because everyone knows that if an indefinite extension is applied for, it will certainly cause serious opposition. Italy openly advocated for an extension, and the United States supported it. However, the representative of the Czech Republic, Pinis, and other small countries strongly opposed it. German Foreign Minister Neurath sent a telegram to the Disarmament Conference, accusing the great powers of not fulfilling their promise to disarm. A reply from the great powers was drafted at the meeting tonight. It is heard that the letter strongly refutes Neurath's accusations. The letter will be issued after being reviewed and approved by the General Commission on Monday. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) US government officials expressed agreement with the resolution to advocate for the extension of the General Commission of Disarmament, but firmly opposed closing the meeting. The State Department stated today that the US representative, Davis, has the right to support the proposal for the General Commission to extend the meeting, without the need to consult with Washington. US officials believe that Germany will not be able to rejoin the Disarmament Conference, at least temporarily, and the conference should try to preserve itself, so as not to disintegrate and cause a major international arms race. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, made candid remarks today when accepting the resolution of the peace delegation, saying that a government that disregards the collectively recognized peace system of the world cannot be trusted to be consistently loyal to peace. The current situation is more serious than at any time since the Disarmament Conference first convened. Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference makes it necessary for us to ask ourselves what we intend to do in Geneva today. The huge armaments of various countries today are caused by fear. If this continues, there will be a day when world peace will be broken. Therefore, the need for a disarmament convention is now more urgent than before. (Sixteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Germany Has Not Abandoned Reconciliation; It Can Participate in Meetings Outside of Geneva <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German officials claimed that if Germany is allowed to cooperate with each other in a way that does not harm the country's honor, then Germany is extremely willing to do its best to jointly maintain peace in Europe. According to current reports, the German government is quietly awaiting developments in Geneva on Monday, hoping that Germany's position can be correctly explained. According to people in the official circles, the main point of Prime Minister Hitler's radio broadcast speech is to express that Germany has not abandoned hope for a peaceful resolution to all issues in the future. This can be confirmed by the speech given by Propaganda Minister Goebbels near Koblenz to veterans who participated in the struggle in 1923, stating that Germany's recent actions are not to disrupt peace but to maintain peace, and that Germany withdrew from the Disarmament Conference only because it did not want to be treated as a second-class country.</p>
<p>The general opinion here now believes that there will be more and more discussions regarding disarmament or European peace held outside of Geneva. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has suggested changing the venue to Rome for discussions. Although the former Allied powers have expressed opposition, it is heard that the German official attitude is that it can agree to the proposal to go to Rome or another place outside of Geneva for negotiations.</p>
<p>However, foreign diplomats here do not believe that making concessions to Germany on the issue of armaments is enough to make the Germans change their minds and reconsider their decision to withdraw from the conference and the League of Nations. The problem is not just this. The first thing that must be done now is to eliminate the perspective of viewing Germany as a</p>

<p>(Berlin) The German election on November 12 may result in the abolition of the German presidential office. Judging from many phenomena, after the majority of the people support Hitler's policies, German President Hindenburg will decide to step down and make the National Socialist Party the ruler of Germany. There is no doubt that President Hindenburg is willing to resign and cede the throne to the deposed emperor. The former crown prince recently went to Nutec to meet with President Hindenburg, which has caused much discussion in political circles. However, the National Socialist Party may not truly welcome the imperial system. The leaders of the National Socialist Party have recently been discussing the issue of abolishing the presidential system and establishing a ruling office after Hindenburg resigns. During the election on November 12, voters only need to draw a cross on their ballots to show agreement, otherwise they do not fill in a single word to indicate that they do not approve of the government's policies.

<p>Munich Today, German Prime Minister Hitler held a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Art Academy here, with many celebrities present, including all the foreign consuls. At that time, the Bavarian Minister of the Interior presented Hitler with a beautiful silver hammer to use for the ceremony. This hammer is a symbol of the National Socialist Party movement, and it is hoped that it will be used for all major ceremonies in the future. After Hitler received the hammer, he gently struck the cornerstone, but unexpectedly, the hammer suddenly broke. Everyone looked at each other in dismay, and Hitler was also greatly disappointed. He immediately sat down and did not say a word. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>There is little comment here on Hitler's claim that Germany only wants the Saar region. The main reason is that the Germans have always regarded the Saar as a part of German territory and firmly believe that the results of future residents' votes will definitely be returned to Germany.</p>
<p>German government officials have now clearly stated that if a disarmament convention is to be drafted without Germany's participation and then submitted to Germany for ratification after its establishment, the Germans will regard this as an act of provocation. (Fifteenth Dispatch from the People's National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is currently handling the situation extremely calmly, with absolutely no demonstrations. The idea that Germany has been treated unfairly and regarded as a second-class country has long been instilled in the minds of ordinary Germans by newspapers and radio, so the Germans are convinced that Hitler, as a powerful figure, will definitely restore Germany to a strong country. Hitler has now received thousands upon thousands of telegrams, all agreeing to support him until death. There is no mention of rearmament anywhere. On the surface, the German government does not want to violate existing treaties but will watch its actions and their impact on countries around the world, especially France, and then decide on the next steps. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The memorial to the war dead in the small town of Helauf in the Rhineland was unveiled today. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels gave a speech, detailing the seriousness of the current situation, roughly saying (Our attitude is not an expression against peace, but our goal is to maintain peace. If Germany's interior is consolidated, it will be better able to maintain peace. On the contrary, if Germany declines day by day, then a neighboring country will see this and become envious. We have already decided to abide by the various treaties that we have signed, so countries cannot ask us to sign treaties that Germany cannot fulfill. The German government is led by people who care about honor, and the world should know this. If all countries can truly disarm, then Germany will be able to do the same, and even the last machine gun will not be retained. As far as Germany's current military equipment is concerned, it is not only unable to wage an offensive war, but it is also not enough for a defensive war. Universal disarmament is a promise contained in the Treaty of Versailles, and all countries in the world can demand its fulfillment. This demand is the smallest possible right that the Treaty of Versailles grants to us, and this is all we are asking for. Our intention is to prevent the German people from experiencing the pain of war again. The new House of Representatives will hold elections on November 12. From now on, the German government and people will be united and inseparable, and people from various countries can no longer say that Germany is practicing a reign of terror), etc. (Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German congressional election has been set for November 12. New methods will be used for this election. Each voter will be given a list of candidates and asked to sign a (yes) or (no) on it, because there are no other parties in Germany except the National Socialist Party. On the day of the election, a general assembly of citizens will be held to vote on whether to approve Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, and this method will also be used. According to the old German law, any party not represented in Congress only needed to provide proof that its candidate had 60,000 signatures of support in order to be included on the official candidate list. This law was abolished by the law prohibiting the organization of political parties on July 14 of this year. (Fifteenth Dispatch from the People's National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Paris) Officials are not expressing any opinions on the situation caused by Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations. France's attitude toward this matter has probably not yet been decided, because this matter and its results are extremely serious and must be considered carefully. In addition, Paris is well aware that the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva, Henderson, and the representatives of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, are holding important talks, and the results of these talks will have a major impact on the attitude that the countries concerned will take. Therefore, Paris believes that it should deal with it with a cautious attitude. The general public also believes that the current situation is very clear, and the government will not make a decision lightly on this matter. Although it is not known what the true intentions of the French government are, according to the opinions of members of Congress belonging to the government faction, the work of the Disarmament Conference should continue. They believe that the Disarmament Conference concerns all countries, and that among them are several countries, such as Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, whose armaments are restricted by peace treaties, as well as Germany. These countries may hope to conclude a general disarmament convention so that they can return to normalcy, and such a convention must be universal and enforceable in order to take effect. The majority party in Congress that supports the government also believes that the negotiations on the issue of disarmament should be conducted in such a way that countries that are not members of the League of Nations and have not signed partial treaties (such as the Four-Power Pact), such as the United States, Soviet Russia, and Japan, can also continue to participate in the disarmament effort. If this can be done, then a disarmament convention may be signed, and after it is signed, Germany can still be ordered to add to it, and it will take effect after Germany signs it.

However, under this situation, all parties should carefully consider the current situation in order to discover the path to a final understanding.

<p>(Washington) The State Department today instructed the US representative in Geneva, Davis, to conduct informal discussions in order to establish a compromise on future actions that can maintain peace, because the United States is extremely attentive to future disarmament efforts. At the same time, the New York Times criticized the State Department, ridiculing its turn to the false and difficult position that the Versailles system is now going through. The newspaper said that the attitude that the United States wishes to hold in the face of all the new possibilities must now be prescribed effectively. The reason why the United States did not join the League of Nations before was because the United States was unwilling to guarantee the peace of Europe as it does today.

<h3 id="e25">Japan Watches the Fire from Across the Shore, Taking Satisfaction in the Repeated Blows to the League of Nations <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a formal report from Mr. Nagai, the Japanese envoy stationed in Germany, stating that the German government has announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. Regarding the attitude of the Japanese government, a formal statement will be released today as follows: (This time, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has caused considerable surprise to the representatives of the League of Nations gathered in Geneva and the small European countries. However, considering the relationship between Germany and France at the recent Disarmament Conference, it is natural for Germany to take any resolute action. This is one aspect of the observation. However, Japan's fundamental foreign policy has been based on the guidelines indicated in the imperial rescript issued in March of this year, which has been repeatedly declared and implemented by successive foreign ministers. Furthermore, this case is a European dispute, and Japan's attitude will not be fundamentally affected by any changes. The League of Nations suffered a considerable blow when Japan withdrew. Today, Germany, which is holding Europe's lifeline, has also announced its withdrawal. The blow it will receive will be profound. However, Japan has no direct reason to change its attitude towards the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. It is now only paying close attention to its changes and seriously watching its development. As for the rumors spread by a few European newspapers, which often say that Japan and Germany had an understanding beforehand, these are just groundless rumors and not worth denying. This is specially pointed out and declared.) (United Press, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) It is too early to determine what methods the major powers will adopt in the future to implement the disarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. However, responsible parties in London stated today that rumors circulating outside that the major powers will implement countermeasures, such as occupying the Ruhr River and the left bank of the Rhine River, are completely unfounded. The German government knows that there will be no occupation of German territory, otherwise it would not have taken this action of withdrawing from the Disarmament Conference on Saturday. The occupation of German territory would definitely overturn the Hitler regime. According to reliable sources, this move by Germany is aimed at domestic affairs, because in the past few months, there has been a current of grievances throughout Germany due to the Hitler government's failure to fulfill its expectations. It is heard that the Reichstag fire case is also related to this move by Germany, because the propaganda about the arson case was not as the German government had expected. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">British Newspapers Comment, Acknowledging the League of Nations Suffered a Blow <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(London) This morning, British newspapers all commented on Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, acknowledging that the League of Nations suffered a major blow, but did not echo alarmist claims. Instead, they advocated a calm and collected understanding of the truth of the situation. The Daily Telegraph stated that under the command of the National Socialist Party, Germany's recent and most astonishing spirit may cause concern that it endangers peace, but this is unfounded. The temperament of Hitler's faction and aggressive nationalism have already created an unfavorable situation in the disarmament atmosphere and international detente. Today's situation is not necessarily more dangerous than before. The possibility of improving the overall situation still exists. The terms of the Four-Power Pact signed by Germany can still be used as a tool for Germany to request the reopening of negotiations. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always believed that it is easier to find a solution using this tool than using any tool in Geneva. The Italian Prime Minister has long foreseen this. In the future, facts will prove his vision. The Morning Post stated that this is not a time for panic. It is appropriate to accept Hitler's proposal to negotiate and resolve issues with various countries in order to test the claim that the German government and the public are unanimously adopting a policy of peaceful mediation and understanding. The Times advised the public not to lightly issue alarming words about the outbreak of war and requested the government to announce to the world the solutions that are about to be completed but rejected by Germany. The first responsibility of various governments is to show Hitler that the methods he has adopted are too rash and will ultimately be difficult to succeed in diplomacy. It is imperative to make the Germans understand that the greatest obstacle to the success of the disarmament convention is the intentional excessive militarization of the German people and that the greatest need for peace in Europe is the spiritual disarmament of the Germans themselves. The Westminster Gazette stated that the disarmament convention must still be thoroughly carried out, hoping that Hitler's declaration of being committed to peace contains the meaning that the door to peace has not been completely closed. The Daily Mail stated that if Germany's decision is implemented, the League of Nations will be in a shattered state. The current crisis is the possibility that Hitler's actions may cause other countries to implement countermeasures. If so, the consequences will be even more serious. The duty of the British government is to prevent the British Empire from being drawn into this kind of conflict. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The formal note of Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has not yet been delivered here. Therefore, the general public holds some hope that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is currently privately persuading Hitler to be more moderate. It is said that today, disarmament alone is not enough to guarantee peace. It is necessary to eliminate suspicion and the spirit of aggression first. Therefore, Hitler's declaration, advocating negotiations to resolve various disputes, is aimed at eliminating the psychology of war so that countries can sincerely be friendly. His words are worthy of respect. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Soviet Newspapers Comment That the Rule of the Fascist Party is Shaking <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" reported that the result of Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference has completely disintegrated the League of Nations, shamefully failed the Disarmament Conference, and seriously threatened the Four-Power Pact. Together, these factors have promoted the collapse of the entire system of relations between capitalist powers. The newspaper stated that (this move has become a very important symbol in the increasingly acute process of imperialist conflict. The newspaper pointed out that the leading imperialist powers in Geneva did not make any unexpected demands on Germany. The fascist regime relies on the conflict between Britain and France and places its special hopes on Italy. However, Germany's hope that France would become isolated in Geneva is not correct. Fascist Germany is facing a united front of Britain, Italy, the United States, and France. Germany is impatient with the continued development of its international position and domestic situation. It wants to express its strength by withdrawing from the League of Nations. However, in reality, it only shows its political weakness and isolation. The rulers of Germany, even to the Soviet Union, which has never been hostile to Germany, do not hesitate to seriously worsen their relations.) The newspaper mentioned the difficulties of this winter, which will make it more difficult for Germany. (The failure of Germany's foreign policy and the shaking of its internal affairs have caused the fascist camp to split. The Reichstag fire case has clearly shown the true face of the Fascist Party's rule to the German people and the world. The Fascist Party government believes that its withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference will be able to stir up a new wave of patriotic warlord agitation. In the clamor for re-elections of the parliament, they hope to suppress the voices of domestic discontent. In this situation, the threat of peace is becoming increasingly serious. Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations indicates the total collapse of the League of Nations. Germany's rejection of the disarmament conference is a threat to the conference of a shameful failure. This result is also inevitable because most of the members attending the conference are unwilling to step into the path clearly indicated by the Soviet Union's proposal in Geneva. German Fascism has announced to the world that it has embarked on the path of preparing for war, and the expansion of armaments is a necessary condition for this preparation. The Four-Power Pact has also been severely threatened. The entire system of relations between capitalist countries has declared its bankruptcy. Facing the facts of internal failure and international isolation, Fascist Germany is acting even more dangerously and threatening peace. All those whose duty it is to strive to maintain international peaceful relations should consider this danger.) (TASS, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has begun a charity movement, calling it (Mobilizing for Human Needs), which will last for four weeks. President Roosevelt gave a speech, saying that no one will be allowed to starve to death this winter. All individuals, cities, towns, and states should also do their part to save the poor. The President also said that recently some people have written to me, claiming that they are not bound by charitable obligations. This view is wrong. Although American culture is based on (individual responsibility), it is a big mistake to say that it is not bound by charitable obligations or to help each other. (Havas, 15th)</p>

The special office of the Financial Rehabilitation Bureau will allocate funds based on the assets of banks that have closed since January 1 of this year, up to a maximum of half of the total deposit amount, and the funds already allocated will be within this amount.

<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan visited He Yingqin at 8:00 this morning, accompanied by Qin Decun, to report on the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province and the summoning of the Mongolian Autonomous Conference by Prince Wang. The discussion lasted about three hours. The miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province were reorganized into eight regiments, with four infantry regiments and four cavalry regiments, under the command of Zhao Dengyu and Zhang Yunrong. Military pay has been barely paid. Liu Guitang, Tang Yulin, and Fang Ji are indeed in contact. Now, because Fang Ji's power has waned, they are waiting and watching. Liu has representatives active in all parties, but when he is not in action, the Chahar authorities should continue to pay the military pay and clothing expenses as before. Tian Gangyi, Liu's representative in Ping, and Wu Jiabin, Tang's representative, will visit Yingqin in the coming days to report on everything. The authorities still hope that Tang Yulin can leave the army and handle the issue himself. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Conference has an obvious background of manipulation by a certain country. The princes attending, such as Prince Zhuo, Prince Suo, and Prince Yang, expressed their opposition. More than fifty Beizi and Beile had different opinions, so it broke up without result. Song Hou Shao Xiong, Zhao Bu Lian, and others went north to Inner Mongolia to express condolences. It is undecided whether Song will go with them. Wang Jingwei telegraphed Song Zheyuan, saying that Huang Zhao Ding will depart for Zhangjiakou on the 22nd. After the Japanese Consul Hashimoto returned to his post, he has been busy with social engagements. He has not discussed diplomacy with the Chahar authorities. There have been no traces of Japanese aircraft in the Duolun area. (Special Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou said that after Song Zheyuan went to Ping, the provincial government affairs were handled by Wei Lantian, and the military affairs were handled by Zhang Weifan as acting. Zhao Dengyu came to Chahar on the 14th to visit Song and report on the situation of suppressing bandits in Zhangbei. He returned to Zhangbei for defense on the afternoon of the 15th. Xiao Zhenying is scheduled to go south with members of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 19th to visit Wang in Beijing and then transfer to Jiangxi to visit Jiang separately to report on the military and political affairs of Chahar Province.

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou said that Lan Lixun, the Wu Guomusi who participated in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Conference in Bailingmiao, came to Chahar from Pangjiang on the 14th to talk. Three Mongolian princes attended the conference convened by Prince De, as well as more than 30 Zasaks and others. Two people from a certain country were also present. When the meeting was opened, Prince De did not allow the people of a certain country to attend the meeting. He announced the significance of the meeting, saying that the oppression of Japan and Russia is becoming more and more intense. Establishing Inner Mongolia's autonomy is a need of the times to save the country and strengthen national defense, not to disturb the country or resist the central government. There were also two memorial papers for circulation, but none of the princes present expressed their opinions. Prince De had a bad impression of this meeting and his desire to be close is becoming more passive. (Special Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The War Zone Relief Committee previously sent personnel to various counties to distribute emergency relief, which has been mostly completed. However, the three counties of Changping, Miyun, and Huairou in northern Ping and the two counties of Linyu and Funing in eastern Luan were unable to provide relief due to the Fang Ji issue and bandit disturbances.

Yesterday, the Relief Committee ordered them to distribute it nearby in Changli. At present, the total amount of funds released is about 300,000 yuan. Because emergency relief is only given to the extremely poor, everything is ready for the agricultural relief part. Before the public debt is carried out, all the counties and villages in the war zone have organized farmers' mutual aid societies.

<p>(Nanjing) At 8:00 AM on the 16th, the Central Government held its 100th Commemoration Week. Attendees included Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Dai Chuanxian, Li Ciwen, Chu Minyi, Chen Lifu, Li Zonghuang, Zheng Zhannan, Zhang Zhen, Yang Hu, Wang Qi, Kexinge, Zuo Min, and staff, totaling over 300 people. Chairman Ye Chucang presided, and Dai Chuanxian reported on the construction of the examination system, stating, "The current examination system, after three or four years of preparation by the Examination Yuan, is still far from what the Premier [Sun Yat-sen] hoped for. This is because the September 18th Incident disrupted all government construction. Our country has historically valued rule by men, hence the saying, 'When the man exists, the government thrives; when the man dies, the government ceases.' Western countries value the rule of law, which is completely different. If our country values rule by men, then the way to promote the virtuous and select the capable is through examinations. The examination system of the Qing Dynasty can only be taken in spirit, not in method. The abolition of the Qing Dynasty's scientific examinations was not because the examination system itself was bad, but because the foundation of the examination, the school system, was not sound. We should pay attention to several points when promoting examinations: (1) First, reorganize the school examination system to bring it under the authority of the national examination system. (2) Implement a performance evaluation method to ensure that virtuous and capable officials are protected, and that incompetent officials are motivated to improve. The independence of the national examination authority is now very necessary, and time is running out. It is hoped that all comrades will study the examination system and find a good direction."

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Commemoration Week at 9:00 AM on the 16th. Attendees included Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Niu Yongjian, Shao Yuanchong, Tan Zhen, Chen Lifu, Zhang Ji, Huang Fusheng, Wang Shijie, He Yaozu, Wang Yongbin, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and over 400 National Government staff. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Tan Zhen gave a report titled (Relief for Rural Areas and Controlled Economy), stating that recently, a National Economic Committee was organized to control national agriculture, food, minerals, cotton yarn, etc. Therefore, the general public attaches great importance to this issue. China is founded on agriculture. When discussing the economy, agriculture is naturally the basic unit. Therefore, relief for rural areas and a controlled economy cannot be separated. Currently, the economic situation of various countries is gradually progressing from a free individual economy to a national economic organization. China's social economy is fragile, and it is even more difficult to talk about a national economy. To implement economic control, there must be two prerequisites. First, we must investigate the reasons for the decline of rural areas. In recent years, China has been plagued by frequent internal wars, and there have been many exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, so that farmers' hard work throughout the year is not enough to pay taxes. To revive rural areas, we must abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. Second, the people must cooperate with the government, that is, social economy and government finance must be mutually circulated. If we want to stabilize finance and regulate prices, we must stop speculative business in various exchanges. Second, we must recognize the basic principles of the economy, that is, we must gather technical talents. If we do not have technical talents, we may borrow talents from other countries. Furthermore, we must strive for the development of national transportation. If goods and finance cannot circulate rapidly in various places, economic control will still be impossible.

<h3 id="e50">Reasons for Germany's Withdrawal from the League of Nations: A Diplomatic Official's Comments <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan disregards the League of Nations and uses force to invade China, ignoring all international conventions. All countries believe that the foundation of the League of Nations has been fundamentally shaken. Therefore, they have expanded their military preparations. After Japan, Germany suddenly announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, which has attracted worldwide attention. According to a diplomatic official, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations has been brewing for a long time. After Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it had this motive. Recently, it failed to compete with other countries for equal military preparations, so it resolutely withdrew from the League of Nations, which proves that there was considerable preparation beforehand. Regarding whether Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations is appropriate, our government has not yet reached the time to express its opinion. My personal observations are no more than two points: (1) Germany believes that the current international security crisis is no less dangerous than before the outbreak of the European War in 1914. Observing the competition among countries to expand their military preparations and compete with each other, it feels that its national defense is weak and is restricted by the League of Nations. (2) The German authorities, considering the increasingly close relationship between Russia and France, have made plans for the future and secretly combined with a certain country. There is factual evidence of this. Our country cannot but pay special attention to this as the main reason for their announcement of withdrawal from the League of Nations. After Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the prestige of the League of Nations will inevitably suffer a great loss invisibly, and there is no prospect for world peace. This is not only related to the interests of our country, but also to the entire safety of the world. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

The National Salvation Association immediately resolved to confiscate and auction off his family property for public use, and offered a reward of 500 yuan for Lin's arrest. Lin has connections with Taiwanese people and is currently in a building above a foreign firm on Chao'an Street. The Japanese Consul in Shantou sent a special letter to the municipal government protesting, relying on the Sino-Japanese Trade Treaty to strongly argue, warning the authorities not to arbitrarily arrest those employed by its nationals without cause in the future, and to allow Japanese ships to dock in Shantou, permitting them to employ small boats to load and unload passengers and cargo, without causing various difficulties. After receiving the letter, the municipal government forwarded it to the municipal party headquarters for investigation and reply. The party headquarters then instructed the National Salvation Association to handle the matter. The National Salvation Association, believing that the Taiwanese were using the name of a Chinese company to undermine the national salvation movement, replied based on the facts, stating that the company had not declared itself as a foreign capital or registered with the government, and that Lin had connections with a certain alcohol tax bureau and a certain monopoly bureau, sufficient to prove that he was Chinese. However, the attitude of the Japanese Consul in Shantou was exceptionally strong. Furthermore, at 2:00 PM on the 7th, four investigators from the National Salvation Association, including Zhang Cheng, were patrolling near the Huilan Bridge riverside when they saw a black olive boat sailing in the middle of the river, its appearance suspicious. They ordered it to stop. Upon searching, eight large packages of shark fins were suddenly found under the black olives. The investigators took the carrier, Chen, and the shark fins back to the National Salvation Association. Ma Zonghan, the committee member on duty, interrogated Chen, who confessed to being from Doutou Village in Chenghai, aged 29. He claimed that the goods were entrusted to him by someone else. The National Salvation Association, suspecting that Chen was connected to a certain merchant on Tongjin Street and that he was undoubtedly smuggling, immediately detained Chen in prison and stored the shark fins in the storage warehouse. A short time later, a certain company opened by Taiwanese people on Tongjin Street, upon hearing that the goods had been intercepted, immediately sent two Japanese to the National Salvation Association to retrieve them, but were unsuccessful. At 4:30 PM, over twenty Taiwanese, armed with short guns, suddenly stormed into the National Salvation Association, closing the inner and outer doors, and sending people to guard the entrance and monitor the telephone. Committee members Ma Zonghan, Wu Qiupu, and other staff members, caught off guard, fled into small rooms in the adjacent alleys. The objects in the hall were destroyed. They demanded that the association release Chen and the shark fins, and cursed the National Salvation Association in various languages. No one in the association responded or resisted. The Taiwanese then went downstairs, broke open the locks of the detention center, and released seven people who had been imprisoned: Chen, Huang Yashi, Lin Xing, Li Tiequan, Lin Yuchun, Lin Yazhong, and Chen Xuwen. All of the above were identified by the National Salvation Association as being involved in smuggling Japanese goods and having connections with the Taiwanese. The eight packages of shark fins were also taken away. When they left, they calmly marched out in formation. The police in the area, not having received orders from the Public Security Bureau, did not intervene. Afterward, the municipal government, upon receiving the report, sent Liang Shunan, the head of the social affairs section, to investigate. The Japanese Consul also sent a secretary to investigate. The National Salvation Association telegraphed the authorities about the incident, requesting instructions on how to proceed. If there were no concrete measures, the committee members would resign en masse. Mayor Zhai Zongxin also personally went to the National Salvation Association to inquire and, together with Liang Shunan and Xu Dingguang (an important member of the National Salvation Association), went to the Japanese Consulate to negotiate. The Japanese Consul claimed to have had no prior knowledge of the Taiwanese's attack on the National Salvation Association. On the evening of the 7th, the National Salvation Association held an emergency meeting and resolved to submit a detailed report of the incident to the municipal party headquarters, which would then forward it to the municipal government to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Consul, demanding (A) an apology, (B) punishment of the perpetrators, (C) compensation for losses, and (D) a guarantee that such behavior would not occur again in the future. The outcome will be reported in the next issue. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Establishment of a Special Administrative Office; Chen Jitang Appoints Zhang Chi as Commissioner; Jurisdiction Includes More Than Ten Counties Recovered by the Guangdong Army <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the Guangdong Army entered southern Jiangxi last year to suppress the Communists, it has successively recovered more than ten counties, including Ganzhou, Daxi, Nankang, Shangyou, Chongyi, Qiannan, Dingnan, Longnan, Xinfeng, Anyuan, and Xunwu. Previously, after the recovery of various places, it was still necessary to search and suppress the remaining bandits and handle post-war matters. Regarding the administrative affairs of each county, only the Political Affairs Office newly established by the First Army Headquarters was responsible for handling them; no independent agency commissioner had ever been established. However, recently, the people of various counties in southern Jiangxi jointly submitted a petition to the Central Government and the Nanchang Headquarters, requesting that southern Jiangxi be designated as a special zone and that a high-ranking official be appointed to take sole charge of reorganizing the politics of southern Jiangxi. At that time, Chairman Chiang believed that southern Jiangxi urgently needed to be designated as a special zone and that a commissioner be appointed to reorganize politics. Therefore, he telegraphed Chen Jitang to seek his consent and requested that Chen appoint important officials as the administrative head of the special zone. Thus, Chen specially established the Southern Jiangxi Political Affairs Special Office in Ganzhou, appointing the current Administrative Inspector of the Thirteenth District of Southern Jiangxi, Zhang Chi, as commissioner, and Fang Dehua as deputy. The internal organization of the Special Office is divided into two departments, one internally divided into finance, civil affairs, judicial affairs, and education, four sections; one department is responsible for construction. After the establishment of the Special Office, the original Southern Jiangxi Political Affairs Office is not planned to be abolished, because the original Southern Jiangxi Political Affairs Office is under the jurisdiction of the First Army, belonging to the pacification nature, such as the Guangdong Pacification Office, and the administration of the provincial government, there is no conflict. Although the organization of the office has been largely determined, the Special Office is temporary in nature. Once the Communists in Jiangxi Province are suppressed, the politics of Southern Jiangxi will be handed back to the Jiangxi Provincial Government. Therefore, the name "Special Office" is a temporary name. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Discovery of Antiquities in Zhujiaji, Shouxian County; The Discovery Site is Suspected to be the Weapon Depot of the State of Chu; The Tripods are All Engraved with the Words "King of Chu" <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: In Zhujiaji, Shouxian County, northern Anhui, an ancient underground vault was discovered, yielding a large collection of antiquities. The provincial library has dispatched personnel to join the county in inspecting and examining the artifacts, sealing and handing over 787 extant artifacts to the county government for safekeeping. According to someone familiar with the situation, Shouxian was formerly known as Shouchun, the old territory of the State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period. Antiquities discovered over the years have all been objects from the Qin and Han dynasties, but none have been as numerous as the treasures discovered this time in Zhujiaji. This spring, a geomancer skilled in locating tombs passed through Zhujiaji and saw a high mound (locally called Li San Gu Dui) with five-colored soil patterns. He determined that there must be gold and bronze objects underneath. The locals gathered and discussed excavating it, employing more than one hundred and sixty workers, digging through five or six zhang of mud, which was about two zhang long. They indeed found various kinds of ancient bronzes. The surroundings were all framed with large timbers. The timber was firm and arranged in several layers, about seven or eight rooms in size, resembling an armory rather than a tomb. Among them, the most valuable are a large tripod weighing over 700 jin (with tadpole-like inscriptions on the waist, similar to Xia and Shang characters), a medium-sized tripod weighing 100 jin, and smaller ones weighing 70 or 80 jin each. All the tripod covers are engraved with characters and have extremely ancient patterns. There are also large and small bronze pots, like woks, tripod pans, or pots, with different shapes, as well as trays, goblets, zuns, tables, tun, pots, ancient bowls, agricultural implements, and so on, complete with everything. Jade objects include square gui, round bi, jade rings, jade jue, jadeite balls, and beautiful jade pieces, mottled and dazzling, captivating the eyes. Weapons include swords, spears, halberds, helmets, arrowheads, and hidden arrows. Stone objects include dragon-shaped coiled dragons, square, long, and patterned in various styles, as well as eight stone oxen, intricately carved. In addition, there are various miscellaneous objects, such as sacrificial offerings from the ancestral halls of the Three Dynasties, the names of which are unknown, all rare in this era. However, all the tripods and pots have the words "King of Chu" engraved on them, half of them belonging to the Zhou family, so many people judge them to be objects from the Spring and Autumn period (previous reports from the Yin and Shang dynasties seem to differ slightly). According to historical records, King Kaolie of Chu moved the capital to Shouchun in the year of Gengshen, and all the state treasures were present. It is only unknown in what year they were hidden here. The tomb of King Zhuang of Chu is located at Zhuangmu Bridge in Shouxian, and the tomb of King Kaolie of Chu is located at Chaanji, both far from Zhujiaji. This discovery should be a storage vault, not a burial tomb. It is a pity that the locals do not know its value and have privately sold about fifty-one items at reduced prices. If they are spread overseas in the future, would it not be a loss of national essence? In total, more than eight hundred ancient artifacts were excavated this time, surpassing the products unearthed from the tomb of Zheng Zhuang Gong in Xinzheng County, Henan Province. Therefore, the Anhui Provincial Government has repeatedly ordered the county to transport them to the province for preservation. (October 15th)</p>

<p>The home of Cai Peida, a gentry in Xihutang, was robbed, resulting in the loss of a huge sum of cash and valuables, amounting to tens of thousands. The case has been investigated for several months, but no clues have been found. A few days ago, Fei Gongxia, a patrol officer of the county's water patrol team, received a report that Deng Xiaofu, a villager from Caohao Township, was highly suspected of being involved in the case. Officer Fei proceeded quietly to Caohao, arrested Deng at his address, and interrogated him. Deng confessed to receiving over two hundred yuan of the stolen money. On the 17th, he was sent back to the headquarters for investigation. Also, at the end of last month, in the case of robbery and injury at the home of wealthy gentry Wu Youlan and Wu Youzhu in Zhujiaxing, it was reported that a certain agency had apprehended a suspect in each of the Hu family's two residences in Ganxiang on the evening of the 16th. However, they have not yet been sent to Songjiang.</p>

<p>Shen Zhuying, a blind man from Haimen, lives in Dongtai. Because his sister eloped before her wedding, the groom's family insisted on demanding a return of the betrothal gifts. Shen had no words to reply and was extremely anxious. Hearing that his sister was hiding in Shanghai, he scraped together fifteen yuan, took a boat to Shanghai, and asked a fellow villager to help him find her. Unfortunately, the remaining nine yuan was stolen. Unable to stay in Shanghai for long, he pawned his clothes. Yesterday, he arrived in Songjiang, his situation miserable. Overwhelmed by his circumstances, he felt pessimistic and attempted suicide by hanging himself with his belt at the East Gate. Wang Wenzhong, a police officer from the town, noticed him, rushed to save him, and took him to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. After learning the whole story, the bureau gave him two yuan for travel expenses and escorted him onto a car to Shanghai. The plight of the blind is truly pitiful.</p>

<p>During the tense situation in the Suzhou area after the Songhu Battle, villagers from Chexie, Xiangcheng, Yin, and Guo in Suzhou Township voluntarily assisted the stationed troops in digging trenches, achieving remarkable results. Now, the farmers have heard that the authorities were paying daily wages for all the trench digging and are surprised. They have requested the county farmers' association to inquire with the county government about whether this is true. Yesterday (the 16th), the county government instructed the association to investigate this matter. Except for the Fourteenth District (Yin and Guo), which stated at the time that the farmers were willing to volunteer and waive payment, the former Finance Bureau paid five cents per day for Weiting, Chexie, and Xiangcheng, all of which were handed over to the respective districts for distribution.</p>

<p>Hua Dazhang, the owner of the Huatai Clothing Store in Jingqiao, outside the South Gate, is addicted to opium. Recently, he was reported to the Public Security Third Sub-bureau by Bao Chenggong, who requested an investigation and arrest. The sub-bureau chief, Mao Yijun, dispatched police officers and arrested both the person and the witness and brought them to the bureau. After entering the bureau, Hua was extremely anxious and immediately asked the landlord Zhu Yaoting and a certain Yuan to find a way. Hua paid 400 yuan, sending 100 yuan to Mao Yijun and 150 yuan to the head office, so that Hua was charged only as a suspect, then released on bail by the court. Unexpectedly, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu learned of the incident and believed that the matter concerned police officers accepting bribes and releasing opium offenders, and that the truth should be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, yesterday he specially sent an investigator to conduct a secret investigation for verification.</p>

The court is planning to build two teaching halls on the west side of the Detention Center. This expenditure is estimated to require 700 yuan, which has been agreed to be donated by Rong Desheng and Lu Bohong. Once the drawings are completed, construction can begin. The prison buildings have been in disrepair for many years and are in danger of collapsing, so Mr. Lu and others are also willing to donate money for repairs.

<p>The dispute over the business of the Dasheng Silk and Satin Bureau, which is opposed by six industries including silk cloth, clothing, Western clothing, and embroidery, in Yangzhou City has lasted for four days. Yesterday (the 15th), the party and government organs convened a mediation meeting and summoned representatives of the six industries and representatives of Dasheng, repeatedly persuading them and allowing all parties to express their opinions. Finally, the solution was determined to supervise Dasheng to join the trade association, abide by the trade association's constitution, and operate the business. The silk and cloth six industries and the Dasheng Silk Bureau immediately stopped distributing flyers, and the Dasheng Satin Bureau immediately removed the "Half Sale, Half Gift" banner hanging in front of the store. The silk and cloth six industries and the Dasheng Silk Bureau in this city should all be operating at the same time on the 16th, and the shop assistants of the six industries should all resume work. It was decided that both parties should abide by it, but the silk industry is still opposing it. The capital side intends to permanently close down the business, and the labor side is determined not to resume work and announced a hunger strike. The labor sides of the other five industries also expressed sympathy, and the shop assistants of each shop knelt three times before Chairman Wang of the Chamber of Commerce, expressing their protest against the mediation meeting's solution and pleading for assistance to achieve the minimum goal of Dasheng selling whole pieces and not retail.</p>

<p>Farmers Wei Dehua and others of Yu Fu Township in the eighth district of the county accused Xiang Chief Wei Dexiu Jia Chief Pu Youding, Supervisory Committee Member Li Maohua, and others of exploiting the villagers and privately collecting a mu tax of five points per mu.

Because the attempt was unsuccessful, they ordered Tuanxi to hang Wei on the Mapidun in the west suburb and beat him until he was injured. The villagers could not sleep peacefully, so last night (the 12th) they came to the city and jointly filed a criminal complaint with the county government, requesting the police to arrest Wei and others and bring them to justice for strict punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, the chairman, gave a speech, which stated: "Today, I represent the National Economic Committee to say a few words. The central government deeply knows that the current world is full of disputes and contention, vying for dominance. It all comes down to economic problems. China's weakness and humiliation today, unable to recover, are also economic problems. The country can survive, and the nation can become self-reliant, only if we first develop the country's economic strength. Therefore, the government has established the National Economic Committee. In the future, we will devote all our energy to this. I hope that the people of the whole country will be energized and work together. This is the great cause of saving the country and saving the people. The Economic Committee plans to set up various control committees to use the power of the state to help various important industries move forward. Today, the Cotton Industry Control Committee is the first to be established. This is something that is worth taking as a most pleasing event. Why should the cotton industry be controlled? The National Economic Committee has already issued a declaration to the people, explaining the intention. The cotton industry has a particularly important relationship in the national economic status. But what is the current situation, and what is the future situation? The manufacturing of foreign factories can be seen to be progressing, but Chinese factories cannot follow because of various reasons, so that the distance between the two is getting farther and farther. Countries that are originally backward in production have a phenomenon of oversupply. This phenomenon, on the one hand, is a social pathology, and on the other hand, it is also the imperfection of the business community itself. If this situation continues, the future is really extremely dangerous. But who is responsible for the past mistakes? Today, we have no time to investigate. We only need to be aware of this, and from now on, use all the strength of the country and the people to become a total force and try to save it. There is still hope in the future. This is the meaning of the government using control measures to revive the economic industry. What I hope from you today, on the one hand, is to try to find out the mistakes of the past and correct them one by one. On the other hand, we must also hurry up to build a grand road to the future, so that people in the cotton industry can have a way to move towards a bright future. What kind of direction should this road take, and how should it be built? This whole plan, as well as the distribution and implementation plan, is the work that the Control Committee should do. As long as the plan is formulated, and the majority of the committee members of the Control Committee agree that this road is successful and can indeed reach a bright path, then the government can fully bear this expenditure. This is the determination of the central government. In the future, if any resistance is encountered in the implementation of the plan, the government will also do its best to maintain it in order to seek thoroughness. As for today's problems, the first hope is that all committee members will work together to do this work of saving the country and saving the people. The second hope is that all yarn factories in the country and the people of the country will also unite to work together and do this work as a backing for the country's economic development. Today, your committee is established. I, on behalf of the National Economic Committee, wish its future success."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Mr. Chen's Speech <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The speech of Chen Guangfu, the Chairman of the Association, at his inauguration, was as follows: Today, the Cotton Industry Control Committee is holding its inaugural meeting. I, Guangfu, am honored to be appointed as the Chairman. Minister Song's instructions to us just now asked all committee members to work hard and take on this task of saving the country and the people, serving the nation and society. How dare I, Guangfu, shrink from the difficulty? I don't have in-depth research on the cotton industry. Now using the control method to deal with the cotton industry may cause misunderstanding for many people. This word "control" is naturally a kind of national power, a planned way to manage a certain industry. However, as far as I know, this time the central government's control of the cotton industry is definitely not to nationalize the cotton industry, nor is it to disallow the existence of free capital. It just wants to use political means to</p>
<p>help the business community move forward. If the business community itself lacks strength, the Control Committee will be responsible for doing it. The establishment of the Control Committee is only intended to bring together a majority of thoughtful and active people in the business community, combine them into one unit, and use the power of the government as a backing to fulfill their obligations to the country and society. This is what I can responsibly explain. The scope of the cotton industry is naturally very large, from farmers planting cotton in the countryside, to cotton merchants who transport it, to yarn and cloth factories and dyeing and finishing factories that manufacture it, and then to yarn and cloth merchants who sell it to the final consumers, as well as indirectly related subsidiary businesses, all belong to the cotton industry. However, yarn factories are the soul of the cotton industry. A country without yarn factories cannot be considered to have a cotton industry. If everyone cannot maintain a yarn factory, it is equivalent to having no cotton industry. Recently, the bad situation of the yarn factory industry and the impact on all aspects have been serious enough. The reasons for this are complicated and cannot be described in detail. Natural disasters and man-made disasters, internal troubles and external aggressions are all its illnesses. The target of the global economic panic makes China even more exposed to the weakness of a backward producing country. How many times in the past have maintenance and relief efforts ended in nothing, which is enough to prove that this problem can absolutely not be effectively solved by local methods. A large-scale and bold approach is needed to make a thorough and complete arrangement for the whole thing. Therefore, the Cotton Industry Control Committee came into being at the right time, not by accident. But what exactly will this Cotton Industry Control Committee do in the future? We must wait for all the committee members to discuss it in detail before we can decide on a plan. However, many people in society have already paid attention to this. I feel that it is necessary to first give a general outline within the possible scope. First, our fundamental work must start from the raw materials. On the one hand, we must promote production, and on the other hand, we must improve quality. Cotton industry experts already have considerable plans for this. We now need to enrich the talent organization and actively carry it out, hoping to achieve the greatest effect in a considerable amount of time. However, in addition to planting cotton, we also need to organize transportation, sales, and inspection. For example, providing financial assistance to cotton farmers, formulating cotton grades, and eliminating the malpractices of adding water to cotton must all be actively carried out so that yarn factories can be self-sufficient in raw materials. This is regarding the raw material aspect. Second, regarding the manufacturing aspect, there are more things to do. We must first hire experts to study them separately before we can determine the methods. At the same time, we will investigate the actual situation of the business community and compile statistics to serve as research data. Generally, factory equipment, work efficiency, product standards, accounting systems, labor issues, etc., should all have corresponding methods to be sorted out. We must enable those who run textile factories to follow suit and reach an area of economic and rational management. This is what we must do with all our energy. At the same time, we must also promote the upward development of the business from various aspects, such as technical education to cultivate talents, various equipment to assist technical research, iron factories that manufacture textile machinery, and subsidiary businesses that supply textile factory supplies. These must also be promoted separately. This is the second step of work. Third, we must also have appropriate measures to deal with the transportation and sales of yarn and cloth, especially in the current difficult situation of yarn factories. Relief is undoubtedly urgent. For example, we want to find ways to deal with the unblocking of stagnant goods, the stability of market prices, financial assistance, and tax system reform. However, we dare not say more for the time being whether the effect can satisfy the hopes of the business community, but we must always do our best. This is a symptomatic treatment. These three stages, when put together, constitute the entire work of our controlled cotton industry. From the output of raw materials from the countryside to the factory, and then from the input of products from the factory to the countryside, there must be an optimal and appropriate connection between the organizations in between to make it circulate smoothly without any hindrance. The economic blood vessels of the whole country can naturally flow, and the social livelihood can naturally tend to be stable. However, the degree of this circulation still depends on how hard we all work and how the spirit of cooperation of the people of the whole country is. If the degree of hard work and the spirit of cooperation are less than one point, then the effect of our work must also be reduced by one point. Therefore, we still need the joint assistance of the people of the whole country for our work. Finally, one more word. Just now, Minister Song said that as long as we have methods and plans, the government can fully undertake the financial aspect. This sentence can naturally give us a lot of courage. In the future, the Control Committee will formulate plans and propose plans. We must of course go through extremely careful research and review. Today, I can declare to the Minister in advance that we will not submit plans to the government that are not effective and practical. Once the plan is submitted, we must ask the government to approve it, and at the same time, we hope that the government will provide convenience and strength from all aspects.</p>

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to Zhong Siyun, Director-General of the Public Works Department, stating: Respected Sir, The Shanghai Citizens' United Association First District Branch and the Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Community United Association jointly sent a letter stating:</p>
<h3 id="e102">Disregarding Taxpayers' Interests <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Shanghai newspapers published news that the Shanghai Telephone Company intends to increase its rates again. It is said that once the Public Works Department of the Public Concession approves it, the measures will be announced. It should be noted that telephones are a transportation business, and rates should be extremely low to benefit citizens. Last year, the Shanghai Telephone Company, based on the Anderson Report, which was not suitable for Shanghai's social and economic conditions, and after being rashly approved by the Public Works Department, retroactively increased prices from March 27 of the same year, which aroused opposition from users. Because the authorities brazenly ignored it, users had to pay under protest. It is still a pending case. However, the company recklessly speculated that users have already compromised, and before long, it will increase prices again, and it is unwilling to announce the measures in advance, doing whatever it wants. This is not the method that a public utility operator should take. Your association is the highest authority for taxpayers in the concession, and you must have been prepared long ago. The failure of taxpayers to oppose the telephone rate hike last time was due to the fact that various industries with the largest number of users watched the success, hoping to reap the benefits of the fishermen. However, your association's attitude was too peaceful, and it cannot avoid the criticism of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Looking at Shanghai's business, it is threatened by the violence of the Japanese due to the peace of the Pacific Ocean, causing unease among the people, and the rural areas in the interior are declining, lacking purchasing power. Over the years, there has only been decline, and no revival. However, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, as decided at the taxpayers' meeting, will increase all license fees as much as possible under the condition that no donations will be added this year. Although the land and house donation rates remain unchanged, their value will be overestimated to implement the donation increase. However, this can still be expected to be used for taxpayers. It is only inconsistent with the financial principles. As for public utilities, how should the Public Works Department protect taxpayers so that they can use them at low prices? In fact, it does not meet this purpose. For tap water, it agreed to the water company's amendment to the contract, allowing it to increase prices arbitrarily, causing taxpayers to pay a lot of money. For electricity, it allowed price increases due to coal prices, but it did not order price reductions when coal prices fell. The same is true for trams and public buses. It is well known that the authorities have no regard for taxpayers. The Shanghai Telephone Company, taking advantage of this weakness, naturally dares to keep adding prices and try again and again. The contract can be ignored, and the written agreement of the 30th year of the Republic of China can be ignored. In short, all provisions in the contract that are beneficial to taxpayers are disregarded or allowed to be changed by the Public Works Department, and the provisions that are beneficial to public utility companies are vigorously defended by the Public Works Department. Public opinion is ignored. If we don't fight for this, how can we become a city? We are especially compelled to state this directly, hoping that you will investigate and seriously negotiate, and not repeat the mistakes. We are truly grateful for your friendship. Also, the Shanghai Citizens' United Association 20th District Branch and the Shanghai Sima Road Business Community United Association jointly sent a letter stating:</p>

<h3 id="e103">Heavy Rent and Fees Are Unbearable <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to change to an automatic machine, wants to increase the rent and fees for users again, and has submitted a request to the Public Works Department for review. Since the Shanghai Telephone Company increased prices once last year after the Public Works Department approved it according to the Anderson Report, it has not been a year since then, and there is news of another price increase. Since Shanghai was ravaged by the violent Japanese, our special zone's commerce has fallen by thousands of feet. The market is currently sluggish, and all industries are declining. It is difficult to maintain the status quo. If we increase unexpected expenses, it will be difficult to maintain. Moreover, the authorities of the Chinese telephone company, in order to revitalize the market, first canceled the telephone fees in the Chinese Concession. However, although the Concession telephone company has been repeatedly negotiated by your association, it has still not achieved satisfactory results. Now, this company not only does not cancel the call fees, but also intensifies its efforts, wanting to use the excuse of retrofitting automatic machines to deceive the Public Works Department, hoping to pass the board of directors, increase the burden on users, and satisfy the private pockets of shareholders. Is there any reason for this? In this autumn of commercial depression, if we increase the telephone fees for users again, it will be unbearable. We should ask your association to negotiate with reason. It is about the interests of the future of citizens and commerce. We beg you to make a strong fight, and please pay attention to the Chinese directors and committee members. This is of utmost importance. If it is approved, commerce will be fortunate. Also, the Shanghai Citizens' United Association 26th District Branch sent a letter stating:</p>
<h3 id="e104">We Have No Choice But to Rise Up and Oppose <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Telephone is one of the public transportation businesses. Therefore, all facilities should be announced in advance and made public to save expenses, reduce interest rates, and increase users to facilitate the needs of society. This business, in the Concession, should be run by the Public Works Department to be a municipal business. Now, the company freely proposes to increase prices without considering the prosperity or decline of the market. The previous price increase negotiation is still in protest. Today, reading the newspaper, the telephone company has proposed to continue to increase prices and requested the Public Works Department to review it. Reading it is extremely surprising. At this time, Shanghai's commerce has not recovered since the war, and there is a chance that it will not be guaranteed in the evening. If we want to seek a turnaround in the market, we must reduce the cost of materials so that it can gradually recover. This association, appreciating the personal suffering of merchants, has no choice but to shout out and rise up in opposition. We have always admired your association as a group of taxpayers. We should ask the Public Works Department to file a serious protest and cancel the company's proposal to increase prices in order to comfort the public and relieve the difficulties of merchants. We are deeply grateful. Various reasons, this association immediately reopened</p>
<h3 id="e105">Violation of the Public Works Department's Contract <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that the Shanghai Telephone Company intends to increase prices again. This association has long known this and is studying the content and quietly observing public opinion and the measures of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession in order to seek proposals that are suitable for social and economic conditions. It is said that the number of increases currently proposed by the company is one-fifth to one-fourth of the current price. If implemented, the residential telephone, which was 52 taels per year when it was not increased last year, will be 81 taels and 2.5 cents per year (assuming another one-fourth increase). The business telephone, which was 78 taels per year when it was not increased last year, will be 131 taels and 2.5 cents per year. The former will increase by a total of 28 taels and 2.5 cents, and the latter will increase by a total of 53 taels and 2.5 cents. Users are naturally unable to bear this in the current declining market. Their expression of opposition is a matter of course. From the perspective of this association, the Shanghai Telephone Company's business situation is really in a loss-making situation every year. It is understandable that it spares no effort to repeatedly request price increases. However, this is a miscalculation on its own. First, the equipment is too wide. Second, the capital is too small. Third, the price increase is too abrupt. Fourth, it does not know the social and economic situation. Fifth, it is not familiar with our national character. The telephone lines equipped by the Shanghai Telephone Company are said to have 100,000 branches, but only more than 40,000 are actually used. Anyone with commercial knowledge knows that it is not enough to avoid losses. This is one reason. Second, with a business of more than 20 million taels, the capital is only 5.75 million taels. The rest is taken from the company's bonds of 5 million taels and other loans for activities. If there are more users and the number of lines set up is not far away, there will be room for maneuver. Now, on the one hand, the income cannot naturally increase, and on the other hand, the interest on debts that cannot be stopped must be paid, so it is difficult not to seek artificial price increase methods to make up for the shortfall. This is the second reason. If the automatic machine is fully installed and prices are not increased immediately, then with the convenience of calls, the number of installations will inevitably increase. If the number of residential users increases by 10,000, the company will have an additional income of 520,000 taels per year. If the number of business users increases by 10,000, the company will have an additional income of 780,000 taels per year. Although there are more users, the branch fields should increase, but the two are offset, and there must be a surplus without shortage. Unexpectedly, the company did not see this and increased prices after the Japanese disturbed Shanghai. Those who wanted to install it were even more hesitant. This is the third reason. The social economy of Shanghai can be ranked first among other cities in our country, but it is still far behind compared to London and New York. However, the person who made the report was British, and the person who runs the telephone company is American. Their observations are naturally unavoidable. This is the fourth reason. Moreover, the American mentality is fast, and the Chinese national character is still calm. The degree of need for the use of telephones is very different in comparison. Americans use their own mentality to measure the Chinese national character. Naturally, they are incompatible. This is the fifth reason. If the company's understanding makes another mistake, and the Public Works Department forgets its position and approves it due to insufficient understanding, and increases prices again, then users will inevitably take the action of not using or reducing the use of telephones because the needs and expenses are not commensurate. Moreover, with the five-cent call fee of the two telephone companies, they are unwilling to cancel it like the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, using the contract as resistance. Its users are already in an angry state. Once triggered by another huge price increase, the company's gain will be more than its loss, which is inevitable. From a legal point of view, according to the contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Public Works Department in 1930, there are the following four points: (1) During the retrofit period, the usage fee will be charged according to the old price of the China-Foreign German Telephone Company; (2) After the completion of the retrofit of the automatic machine, the number will be increased according to the number in the Anderson report; (3) No price increase will be allowed within three years after the increase; (4) After the three-year period expires, it can be increased as appropriate, to the extent that the income is sufficient to amortize 8% of dividends and 2% of public accumulation. From this point of view, the Public Works Department can immediately reject the company's request for a price increase with the four words "(no need to discuss)" based on the third point above. However, the Public Works Department allowed the company to damage the (law does not retroactively) universally recognized principle by giving the company the exception to the deadline for retrofitting the cross-border telephone and retroactively increasing prices to March 27 of last year. It is inevitable that the public will have doubts and panic about the Public Works Department's attitude towards the telephone company's request for a price increase this time. In fact, although telephones are a convenient means of transportation, they are different from water. It is said that the telephone company wants to be treated the same as tap water, etc., and regards it as a powerful precedent for price increases. This association really believes that it is very unwise.), etc. Also, the Shanghai Municipal Bicycle Industry Association sent a letter stating:</p>

<p>(It is heard that the Shanghai Telephone Company is retrofitting automatic machines and wants to increase the fees for renters again. The news came as a surprise. The telephone price increase has not been a year since the last one, and users already feel overwhelmed. Now there is another price increase. The company does not follow the commercial situation or observe the burden on citizens, and arbitrarily advocates taking the shareholders' private pockets as its goal. Nothing is more disturbing to business and harmful to the people than this. If we do not rise up to resist immediately, we citizens will have no one to rely on. We hereby send a special letter to your association to forward it to the Public Works Department and the Shanghai Telephone Company to file a serious protest and achieve the cancellation of the price increase proposal. If it is not followed, our association will lead all the industries to be the backing for reasonable demands), and the Shanghai Municipal Paint and Dye Industry Association also sent a letter stating:</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Company's Planning Has Many Shortcomings <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Recently, newspapers reported that the Shanghai Telephone Company intends to increase its prices again. Once the Public Works Department of the Public Concession approves it, the measures will be announced. The public is panic-stricken. It should be noted that telephones are a public utility for citizens' transportation, and price increase measures should be deeply aware of social and economic trends. Since Shanghai has changed, the market has been depressed and it is difficult to revive. The industrial and commercial enemies have reached their extreme. In the Concession, business firms have gone bankrupt and closed down one after another due to business losses. This is all a phenomenon of the market depression, which is understandable by the Concession authorities. The telephone company, even if there are business losses, is mostly due to the poor local planning and cannot dig the lean meat to make up for the fat sores. Even if users are burdened with price increases, the contract between the company and the Public Works Department originally had restrictions that no price increase could be made within two years after the retrofit of the automatic machine was completed and the number was increased according to the Anxiang Report. We hope that your association will be the voice of the citizens and safeguard the interests of the public. We hope that you will forward the letter to the Public Works Department to protest and disapprove in accordance with the third point of the contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Public Works Department in 1930 (no price increase shall be made within three years after the increase). We are extremely grateful for the protection of the interests of the citizens and the public. This association believes that although the letters from the above-mentioned groups may be the opinions of taxpayers in the prosperous areas of Nanjing Road and Fuzhou Road, it is intended to observe the situation quietly for a while. On October 3, we received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating</p>
<h3 id="e108">Official Response from the Authorities Agreeing to Pay Attention <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>(After the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase news spread, this association sent a letter to the Public Works Department, forwarding advice stating the various reasons why the price should not be increased. Yesterday, we received a reply stating that the department is considering the telephone company's request and will give due attention to the points raised in our letter, etc., all of which are on file. We hope that efforts will be made to resist and achieve the goal of canceling the price increase, etc. Therefore, this association must express its earnest opinion to your department. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated trade associations, such as banks, money houses, exchanges, and shipping companies, which use telephones the most, are all included, and their opinions are particularly worthy of attention. As for this association's opinion on the matter, in addition to what is stated in the above reply, it is as follows: (1) The Shanghai Telephone Company's miscalculation in its equipment has fundamentally become a situation that is difficult to reverse. (2) This type of equipment is prone to danger even in times of economic prosperity, let alone in the current period of gradual decline. (3) With capital only accounting for about one-fifth, there are no funds to pay for the purchase of American goods, and borrowing American funds incurs an annual interest rate of six percent, which, calculated in silver, is close to eleven percent per annum. (4) It is stated that the number of telephones in use, compared to Anson's estimate of 37,668 lines, is as high as 42,276 lines, indicating that the number of users is still on the rise. (5) It is stated that the capital is 5,757,000 taels of silver, and the borrowed funds are 21,137,000 taels of silver. An investment of 26,894,000, with only about one-fifth of the capital, is unacceptable to entrepreneurs. Moreover, these borrowings are actually in US dollars, so the interest, when converted to silver, will naturally double, such as six percent becoming twelve percent. (6) It is inappropriate for the company to blame Anson's estimate for failing to anticipate future circumstances for its own miscalculation in equipment. Anson's estimate of the number of telephones was only 37,668 lines, not 100,000 lines. (The number of lines installed by the company has not been formally reported, and the statement regarding the installation of 100,000 lines has not been corrected, which is presumed to be true.) (7) In addition to the miscalculation in equipment, the company's fatal wound is the exchange loss suffered by all industries, which is beyond control. (8) If the company wants to break free from difficulties and seek survival, it should not seek compensation from users again. It should sincerely cooperate with users and seek to promote public use of telephones to increase the number of users and increase revenue. Otherwise, from the perspective of public interest, it will be difficult to drastically increase the number of telephone users. If emotional considerations are involved again, the result will not be as peaceful as last year's price increase turmoil. This association should request your department to consider the public interest and the interest of the Shanghai Telephone Company, and to reject its request in accordance with the law, the provisions of the contract, and the company's letter regarding the price increase (August 15, 1920). According to the commercial situation and management theory, the request should also be rejected to prevent the company from becoming even more difficult to manage. As for the company's statement that there will be no further price increase this time, but a 41% increase in 1935, the 1929 budget was already a miscalculation, and the situation in 1935 cannot be foreseen in light of various circumstances. It should be considered again at that time. We hereby send this letter for your review and careful consideration. Addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened its eleventh executive committee meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday to discuss remedies for the Qianyuan Bank's liquidation issue. Wang Xiaolai, Lu Wenshao, Ye Jiaxing, Ma Jiliang, Bei Songsun, Chen Zheqing, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Zenan, Ma Shaoquan, Pan Xusheng, Zhu Wenqi, Jiang Zhigang, Fang Jiaobo, Pei Yunqing, Wen Lanting, and others, totaling fifteen people, attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai, with Secretary Yan E'sheng recording, proceeded with the ceremony as usual. First, the secretary reported that after Qianyuan Bank ran aground, in addition to preparing a certificate of rejection at the request of the bill holders in accordance with the contract law, the Chamber also received a letter from the Silk and Satin Trade Association stating that according to the money trade's operating rules, the bills should be returned to the original issuer. However, the original issuer refused to accept them based on the bill law. The Chamber requested an explanation on how to handle this issue. The Commerce Section then convened representatives from the Silver, Money, and Silk industries to discuss the matter, and the results of the discussion were submitted to the fifty-first standing committee meeting. As the matter involved legal regulations and bill customs, it was resolved to hire lawyers Chen Tingrui and Li Zuyu to conduct research, and their research reports were submitted to today's meeting for discussion. Next, Pei Yunqing, a representative from the Tram Trade Association, expressed his views and reported on the process of Qianyuan Bank's declaration of liquidation. Fang Jiaobo, Luo Qinghua, Bei Songsun, and others also expressed their opinions. As a result, it was resolved that (1) Luo Qinghua, Director of the Commerce Section, should be appointed to supervise Qianyuan Bank, a member of the Money Trade Association, to quickly carry out the liquidation in accordance with the association's regulations; (2) The opinion letters from lawyers Li and Chen, as well as the full text of the Money Trade Association's operating rules, should be copied and sent to the Silk and Satin, Banking, and Timber Trade Associations. The original letter from the Silk and Satin Trade Association and the opinion letters are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Letter from the Silk and Satin Trade <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the payment of goods from Guangbang Tongyongtai to our firm, Qian Yuan Bank, No. 7715, dated September 30th, for 728 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen, one bank note, and the payment of goods from Guang Yulun, Qian Yuan Bank, No. 7597, dated September 30th, for 323 yuan and 7 jiao, and No. 7596, for 3077 yuan, two bank notes, our firm transferred them to Tong Qing Shen Yuan Heng Tong Banks for collection. Unexpectedly, Qian Yuan Bank suddenly ran aground on the evening of September 30th, and all the issued notes were cancelled and not settled. Our firm was still pursued to hand them over. Our firm said that according to the money trade regulations, our firm could only accept them and return them to Tong Yongtai and Guang Yulun. Unexpectedly, those two firms refused to accept them, citing the cancellation of the notes. Also, a Guangbang customer, Tong Yongtai, paid Qian Yuan Bank on September 30th with bank note No. 7857 for 3000 yuan, and immediately gave it to Tong He Bank, which exchanged it. Unexpectedly, Qian Yuan Bank closed on September 30th. On October 1st, Tong He Bank stated that the issuer had already closed down. The bank note for 3000 yuan, although the face has been crossed out, the money has not been paid. According to Article 13 of the Money Trade Association's operating rules, the note should be returned to the original owner. Because the member contacted the original customer number, Tong Yongtai, that firm said that the note has been cancelled and it is difficult to accept the return, so the member also refused to return the note to Tong He. Now, a letter has been received from lawyer Qin Zemin, representing Tong He Bank, insisting that the member take back the note, which has made the member feel difficult and at a loss. In commercial transactions, everything depends on credit. Shanghai money trade bank notes are a medium of trade and are trusted by Chinese and foreign business circles as cash. Now, Qian Yuan has closed down, and the money trade has not shown any responsibility to pay the bank notes in full. As a result, everyone is confused and only wants to shirk the responsibility of the note holder. If this is not remedied, the good credit of the money trade bank notes for decades will be swept away, and the exchange of goods will lose an absolutely reliable object of faith. Is it only the responsibility of holding the above-mentioned 3000 yuan bank note that is the problem? Also, Guangbang Tong Yongtai paid Qian Yuan Bank with bank note No. 7871 dated September 30 for 3000 yuan, and immediately gave it to Yi Chang for exchange. Unexpectedly, Qian Yuan Bank suddenly closed down on the evening of September 30th. On October 1st, Yi Chang Bank returned the cancelled and unsettled note. The member immediately returned the note, and Tong Yongtai refused to accept it. The member is in a dilemma. The only way is to ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to quickly convene the silver, money, and related trade associations to find a proper solution to avoid disputes, etc. According to this, we hereby send a letter to your association, requesting permission to convene and make proper arrangements, and waiting for instructions to comply with.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Li Zuyu's Opinion <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In reply, I received your association's letter No. 3749 regarding the customary practice of returning Zhuang Piao to the root, requesting research and reporting, etc. According to the provisions of the bill law, when a bill is not paid, a certificate of refusal should be made. Unless the making of the certificate is expressly exempted, if the certificate is not made within the time limit, the holder of the bill loses the right of recourse against the previous holder (i.e., the original root) (Article 101 of the Bill Law). However, in Shanghai Zhuang Piao, if payment is not obtained, the certificate of refusal is generally not made, then according to the law, the right of recourse against the previous holder (i.e., the original root) is lost. Therefore, even if the bill is not cancelled, the claim for returning the bill to the original root cannot be made. On the contrary, if a certificate of refusal has been made, then even if the face of the bill is cancelled, there is still clear evidence that it has not been paid, and the previous holder cannot shirk responsibility. Therefore, as a remedy, it seems appropriate to uniformly indicate the words "exemption from making a certificate of refusal" in the Zhuang Piao in order to be consistent with the custom. Furthermore, Article 29 of the Bill Law states that a bill with a blank endorsement can only be transferred by delivery of the bill, and Article 35 also states that if the holder cancels the endorsement, the endorser who is cancelled and the person who is later in the list are exempt from liability. Then it can be seen that the bill debtor who is liable to the holder of the bill under Article 93 of the Bill Law does not include those who have only transferred it in the middle and have not endorsed it. Now, Shanghai's custom of returning the bill to the original holder makes the original root liable regardless of whether it is endorsed or not, which also causes disputes. Therefore, as a remedy, it seems appropriate to require the previous holder to endorse the Zhuang Piao uniformly when delivering it. If the endorsement is not made, and the bill is willingly accepted, it will be regarded as exempting the previous holder from responsibility, so as to be clear. My humble opinion is as follows, whether it is appropriate or not, please consider it carefully.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Chen Tingrui's Opinion <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>In reply, I was entrusted to provide legal reasoning regarding the customary practice of returning Zhuang Piao to the root. I hereby offer my humble opinion for your consideration. The Chinese Bill Law was only promulgated and implemented in 1929. Many of its provisions are based on foreign laws, so they often cannot be integrated with China's inherent commercial customs. For example, the procedures for making a so-called certificate of refusal and endorsing the transfer are not only not done by ordinary merchants, but they have never even dreamed of it. However, the function of money shop bank notes in Shanghai society has not diminished over the years. The reason is that the money shop's credit for bank notes is responsible for exchange even after the shop closes down. However, in recent years, this good custom has been slightly replaced, and the victims are the bona fide holders of the notes. Since the previous holder did not endorse when transferring the note, he cannot be called an endorser, and he cannot exercise the right of recourse against him according to Article 93 of the Bill Law. The money shop that issued the note is determined to close down and has long placed its credit aside. The credit of the so-called No. 1 Datong Bank is almost equal to zero. This is the fundamental problem of Shanghai's money industry. The Money Trade Association cannot sit idly by. The above is about the actual situation. As for the legal principle, in my humble opinion, the holder of the bill has no other way but to seek recourse from the issuer. Although the Money Trade Association's regulations stipulate that the bill should be returned to the original root, it is doubtful whether the previous holder is also included. I am afraid that such an interpretation cannot be made in law. A foolish opinion, I dare to dedicate it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai silk factory industry, due to the sharp drop in the silk market, has resolved through the association to request a reduction in wages, the abolition of the application for work, silkworm moth worship awards, and the strike by workers at the Fulunheng and Shuanggong silk factories. The Social Bureau conducted mediation on all these issues at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Further Mediation on Wages <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>

<h3 id="e117">The Silk Factory Industry Trade Association Convened a Meeting to Discuss Relief for the Sharp Drop in Silk Prices, and Invited Miao Zhongxiu to Speak About His Trip to Europe <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the sluggish silk sales in Europe and the United States and the sharp drop in silk prices, the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Trade Association convened a meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss relief measures and invited Miao Zhongxiu to speak about his trip to Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e118">List of Attendees <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (represented by Shen Huachen), Miao Zhongxiu, Chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Trade Association, Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng of the Jiangzhe Silk Industry Trade Association, Qian Sheng Cheng Bingruo Zhenyi Du Fengbiao, Hong Yu Gu Zhengang, Yun Cheng Zhou Shuyin, Qian Yuan Hu Juqing, Zhenxing Shen Dingsheng, Fei Danru, Tiansheng Mo Yongqing, Fuchang Xu Zuchun, Lin Zhipei, Cheng Ruiting, Honglun Song Zhenyang, Jiatai Zhang Chucai, Guangyuan Mo Jinqing, Yuanji Zhu Fangxing, Meifeng Wang Shunan, Xiangcheng Zhang Peishen, Fuyuan Zu Jinrong, Yifeng Sheng Sun Qinghe, Yuanchun Zhihe Zhu Jing'an, Zhengfang Zha Jianshi, Yuanheng Yuan Bingzhang, Yuanhe Zhao Hongmao, Wang Maochun, Jiufeng Cheng Yuqing, Fuxing Sun Chuanfang, Xinchang Dr. Shi, Mao Feng Hu Qianming, Fengtai Sun Xiangchang, Gongda Sun Longji, Changfeng Yu Zhaijun, Yutai Zhang Chunxu, and others, totaling over forty people.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Mr. Miao's Speech <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Shen Hua presented the purpose and introduced Miao Zhongxiu to speak about his trip to the United States. Mr. Miao stated that the United States imports approximately 550,000 bales of raw silk each year, worth over 430 million yuan, but most of it comes from Japan because China's production has four drawbacks: (1) Unsustainable marketing organizations and lack of marketers; (2) No spot goods; (3) Prices cannot compete and are manipulated by intermediaries; (4) Lack of credit for weaving work. Due to these four major reasons, sales have declined year by year. Currently, China only supplies 15 million yuan of the silk imported by the United States, while Japan accounts for 410 million yuan. If Chinese people can pay attention to this in the future, European and American sales can reach a considerable position. Next, Chu Huiseng reported on the general situation of the Jiangzhe silk industry. The words are long and omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Resolution Method <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The discussion then began, and it was generally agreed that to achieve smooth sales, one must start with oneself. In the current situation, the market should be maintained first in order to achieve smooth sales. After public discussion, it was resolved that: (1) A request should be submitted to the Silk Industry Control Committee to establish a sales organization in advance to maintain silk sales and save the crisis; (2) An official letter should be sent to Dr. Marie, requesting attention to the problem of improving silkworm seeds, improving China's original excellent seeds, so as to preserve the original advantages of Chinese silk.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Representatives from the Silk Weaving Trade Unions in the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts, Yang Shumei, Chen Xiupu, Yang Gengdi, Yuan Yunlong, etc., were chaired by Wang Gang, a mediator from the Social Bureau, with Jiang Baofu recording. First, the employers stated that the European and American silk markets had slightly improved in early July this year, with Chinese silk costing about 900 yuan per load. Now that the silk market has plummeted, Chinese silk costs about 600 yuan per load, a difference of one-third between the high and low prices. All silk factories cannot maintain operations, and the number of factories that have stopped work has increased sharply. In order to maintain the status quo, in addition to canceling the female workers' application for work, worship awards, and silkworm moths, wages will be reduced by eight percent, to 4 jiao and 2 fen. The workers stated that although the silk market is lower than before, the workers agreed to temporarily cancel the worship awards and the silkworm moths for application for work. As for the wages, the mediation record has not been signed for a full year, and it is requested to maintain it. The chairman then announced that the wage issue will be formally convened for mediation by the Mediation Committee next Monday. <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<h3 id="e122">The Fulunheng Case Decided <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from the Silk Weaving Trade Union in the Fourth District, Le Xiaorong and Chen Xiupu, as well as twelve worker representatives, and Fulunheng representatives Shen Zupei and Zhu Weixuan, arrived at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Social Bureau, with Wang Zhiqin recording. First, the workers stated that Shen Rongqing, the Fulunheng administrator, often used bamboo sticks to whip the workers, which caused all the workers to go on strike on the afternoon of April 6th. The trade union sent personnel to persuade them, but because the workers insisted that the administrator be transferred, they refused to resume work, which was ineffective. The employers stated that the administrator never beat the workers, etc. After the strike, when the workers were asked, they did not know the reason for the strike. It was not until several days later that they said they were striking to oppose the administrator. After persuasion by the chairman, the workers' strike was deemed inappropriate. As for the administrator's beating of the workers, it was also prohibited by law. It was decided that: (1) In the future, the factory will be responsible for ensuring that the administrator does not beat the workers; (2) All workers will return to the factory to resume work on the 18th.</p>

<p>Dagon Society said that the workers of the old and new factories of Shanghai Electric Power Company, because of opposing the company's dismissal of workers and withholding pension funds, have repeatedly negotiated to no avail. On the 29th of last month and the 2nd of this month, they successively declared a strike, which has lasted for eighteen days. Although party and government agencies have sent people to mediate, and the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Zhong Si, has made well-intentioned mediation, there has been no result. Most of the Chinese employees have resumed work, but the workers are still determined to strike, and the situation is still serious. Also, the lights in the Hongkou district went out once the night before. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">[P Convocation of Heads Meeting <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Since the labor unrest occurred, although the workers have shown signs of compromise, the company's attitude has remained tough, which has led to a prolonged delay in resolution. The two sides are still at a standstill. The Strike Committee, in order to discuss the final response measures, convened a meeting of all staff on the morning of the day before yesterday to report on the labor unrest and resolved several important cases (the contents are temporarily confidential). The Strike Committee also scheduled an emergency meeting of all heads of the old and new factories at the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions hall at 10:00 a.m. today to discuss the final action.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Most of the Staff Resumed Work <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Electric Power Company Staff Union, in order to support the workers of the old and new factories, convened a general meeting and decided to organize a strike committee to determine that all members would participate in the strike, indicating unanimous action. The company was quite uneasy and urged senior Chinese employees to return to work. On the one hand, it intimidated the striking Chinese employees, causing some weak-willed employees to resume work one after another from the 14th. Yesterday, many more Chinese workers entered the factory to resume work. There are still more than 30 Chinese employees with firm will who have not resumed work, indicating that in order to fight for the dignity of Chinese employees, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and will always take consistent action with the workers. As for the workers, they are still determined to strike, and their steps are very neat.</p>

<p>At 7:00 p.m. the night before last, the lights on Fei Lun Road and Han Bi Li Road in Hongkou and in the vegetable market in the triangular area suddenly went out, and the area was plunged into darkness. Citizens panicked, and stores closed one after another, stopping business. It was not until 7:45 p.m. that the lights were restored. Afterwards, according to a Dagon Society reporter's investigation, the reason for the power outage was that the lead wire in the old factory's shed of the Electric Power Company exploded. Because the workers in the factory had all gone on strike, no one was there to repair it for a while. Later, Western employees tried to repair it in many ways before it was fixed.</p>

The original grain and funds stored in warehouses must not be diverted. Those who have diverted grain shall be strictly ordered to return it. There must be no further collection of illegal taxes on rice and grain, and provinces in rice-producing and rice-consuming areas should cooperate in setting up a marketing organization to seek regulation. If necessary, the central government may be requested to send personnel to guide and assist. In addition to reporting to the court, the original telegram and review records are copied and issued for compliance. This order should be forwarded to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Bureau of Social Affairs Convened a Meeting of Farmers from Various Districts Yesterday to Improve Cotton Production, Employing Scientific Methods to Increase Production; Farmers Lacking Capital Can Apply for Loans from the Bureau <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Three years ago, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs ordered municipal commissioners and farmers' associations in various districts to select six to twelve exemplary farm households within their respective jurisdictions to trial-plant five mu of cotton each. The Bureau subsidized each mu with three yuan, and all planting matters were to be carried out according to the scientific methods stipulated by the Bureau. Fifteen districts and ninety-six locations have now completed the trials. Each district has a senior agricultural expert selected by the municipal committee and the farmers' association as a guidance instructor. The Bureau also sends personnel to inspect at any time to supervise the process. Since the pilot project began three years ago, the results have been excellent, and production has increased invisibly. However, the Bureau also intends to enhance farmers' scientific knowledge to improve cotton production. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., at the library of the Municipal Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road, municipal commissioners and guidance instructors from various districts, including Ji Langqing, Xu Renjie, Zhu Wenyang, and Wu Xirui, and more than thirty other people, were convened for the first meeting. Agricultural expert Ye Yuanding and fertilizer expert Xu Zhengkeng were invited to speak. Wu Huanru, the section chief of the second section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, chaired the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that China is a country based on agriculture, but due to ingrained habits and a lack of improvement, cotton production has decreased in quantity and quality, which has a significant impact on farmers' economy. The Bureau, in view of this, strongly advises farmers in this city to adopt scientific methods of cultivation, but fearing that farmers would not believe it, it subsidized each mu with an additional three yuan to subsidize. Since the trial implementation, the effect has been significant, and production has increased invisibly. Today, everyone is specially invited to come here, and Experts Ye and Xu are invited to give lectures. Please combine your own experiences with the lectures of the two gentlemen and conduct a deeper study. Afterwards, agricultural expert Ye Yuanding gave a lecture on: (A) the uses of cotton for clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, and entertainment; (B) the history of cotton's introduction to China; (C) the cotton farmer's attention to planting methods: (1) good seeds, (2) wide row and plant spacing, (3) intercropping is not advisable, (4) crop rotation is necessary, (5) appropriate fertilizer, more bone meal (6) in terms of agricultural tools, middle tillers and seeders can be used, (7) eliminate diseases and insect pests, (8) cotton picking should be done in batches and stored separately, (9) eliminate malpractices, do not mix water and other substances, (10) select seeds yourself; (D) trial verification on the attention to the promotion of cotton planting: (1) on-site guidance and cooperation with cotton farmers, (2) organize combined cooperatives, (3) do your best to breed cotton seeds, (4) promote ginning factories and grading methods. Next, fertilizer expert Xu Zhengkeng gave a lecture, stating that fertilizer is to plants as food is to humans. All that plants need are the elements of fertilizer, such as nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, etc., and what plants need most and what the soil lacks most are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, so they are called the three elements. These three elements are all found in organic and inorganic fertilizers. The function of nitrogen is to delay maturity, phosphorus can make cotton mature early and harvest more, and potassium can make cotton avoid or reduce the functions of wilt disease and rust disease. The combination of nitrogen and phosphorus can make cotton crops abundant and grow vigorously, avoiding various diseases and other effects. In European and American countries, in cotton planting, phosphorus fertilizer is the most important, and nitrogen and potassium are second. However, in all cotton-producing areas of our country, none are used. Is this why our country's cotton production is not abundant? Shanghai China Fertilizer Co., Ltd. is jointly operated by the eight major oil factories in Shanghai and is willing to do its utmost to help farmers in various places and has specialized personnel to prepare various organic complete fertilizers and cotton fertilizers. Its guaranteed ingredients are 3% nitrogen, 6% phosphorus, and 3% potassium. This kind of preparation is the most suitable for cotton-growing farmers to try. Next, Wang Shuji, agricultural technician of the Bureau of Social Affairs, gave a speech, stating that good cotton seeds must be retained and must not be easily mixed with ordinary cotton for sale. Now the Bureau is negotiating with various factories to increase the price and purchase the cotton produced in this cooperative trial area. The Luhang District has now implemented this measure. It is hoped that the municipal commissioners and the heads of the farmers' associations will assist in the process. If farmers lack capital, they can apply for loans from the Bureau of Farmers. The loans will be repaid, so that the cotton area can be promoted. Guidance instructors Zhu Wenxiang, Wu Xirui, and Wei Langqing then spoke in succession. After the meeting, photos were taken to commemorate the event.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Tax Affairs Administration Replied to the Cotton Cloth Association, Allowing Flexible Transshipment Methods, But Only Limited to the Original Batch Transshipment; Re-packing and Distributing Still Requires a Waybill <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Association previously stated that if cotton cloth transported from Hankou, Nantong, Wuxi, and other places to Shanghai and then transshipped to other ports needs to apply for transshipment according to the regulations, the procedures are too cumbersome. It has sent a letter to the Tax Affairs Administration to change the methods to facilitate transportation and sales. Now it has received a reply from the Tax Affairs Administration approving the matter. The original letter is as follows: Those who reply directly should read the letter. If the yarn and cloth are sold within the scope of the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan, the words "other ports" are filled in on the waybill, which can be used for passage. After handling the case, it is now receiving cotton cloth transported from Shanghai to various places. Because the transshipment order is not collected, there is a situation of deducting orders and penalties. The difficulties are listed in three points, and a request is made for a change in methods. After investigation, the goods transported between the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the words "other ports" are filled in on the waybill, which refers to any port in other ports. Once the goods are transported away from the place of production and reach the destination, (that is, any port in the seven provinces), the original waybill is stamped by the customs or the consolidated tax inspection agency, the effect of the words "other ports" disappears. If it is transported from the place to another place, a transshipment order should be re-issued. This method has been implemented for a long time. Why does your industry feel inconvenienced? The three difficulties stated in the letter are factual matters. The request to mark "Shanghai Transshipment to Other Ports" on the original waybill when cotton cloth is shipped from Hankou, Nantong, Wuxi, and other places to Shanghai and then transshipped to other ports, so as to avoid applying for transshipment again after arriving in Shanghai, is considered feasible. It is hereby approved to handle the matter in a special and flexible manner, but when transshipping from Shanghai to other ports, it can only be transported to any port in other ports, and it is limited to the original batch transshipment. Those who repack and distribute in Shanghai should still apply for a waybill to strictly restrict and prevent abuses. According to the letter, it should be replied accordingly, and it is hoped that it will be checked.</p>

<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, 3,000 workers in the third factory of the British American Tobacco Company on Taopeng Road went on strike on the 13th because the factory refused to recognize the trade union. The Bureau of Social Affairs criticized and disapproved of it. After the Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union sent personnel to persuade them without success, the General Labor Union recommended Zhou Xuexiang, a member of the Standing Committee, to persuade them to resume work today. The workers agreed to return to work, but were rejected by the capitalists, resulting in the failure to resume work. The Fourth District Cigarette Workers' Union reported to the party and government organs for verification. The British American Tobacco Company's branch office also held a meeting to discuss how to deal with it. The party and government organs scheduled a meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow to conduct mediation.</p>

<p>Recently, Chinese spectators discovered a Bengal tiger with a very clear "King" character between its eyes on its forehead in the Haikingbo Circus. For a time, the audience was in an uproar, marveling at the spectacle, and Westerners who knew Chinese characters were also surprised. According to the investigation, many of these "King" characters are composed of black lines, and there is no forgery. Recently, Chinese spectators who visit the zoo are requested to stand near the fence to examine it in detail and witness it with their own eyes. This tiger is named Muxue, the one who fought with his son during the performance the day before yesterday. The beast is a star during the performance and is most noteworthy in the zoo. The circus recently decided that various tickets can be pre-purchased at Muteli Foreign Company. Currently, first, second, and third-class seats are not fixed, and are sold by the company to avoid the audience waiting for a long time in the circus. Boxes and special first-class seats can also be pre-purchased at the circus office on Gedeng Road, Jing'an Temple Road. The group feels that the first-class seats without fixed seats are only sold for three yuan, the location is excellent, the position is high, there is no dust harassment, and the entire venue can be seen from a high position.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing in the zoo is feeding the animals at 11:00 every morning. When fresh beef is thrown in, the beasts such as lions, tigers, and leopards jump and roar and devour it, which is quite spectacular.</p>

Later, the author gave various reasons to prove that the book was not to encourage murder, and its ban was lifted. The brilliance of the content can be seen from this. It has now been translated into Chinese by the famous novelist Qin Shouou and sold by Dadong Bookstore and China Travel Service in Shanghai. The actual price of each book is 1 yuan and 40 cents.

<h3 id="e139">Continued Report on the Fierce Bandit Who Refused to Be Arrested and Shot and Killed Chinese and Western Detectives; After Two Bloody Battles, the Fierce Bandit Was Finally Arrested; Detective Gong Was Supposed to Get Married Soon, But Unfortunately Died Tragically; The Tragic Scene of Blood Staining the Stairs Was Unbearable to Witness <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>At about 2:00 a.m. yesterday, our newspaper's reporter received an emergency report that many Chinese and Western detectives were killed and injured in a fierce battle with bandits at Hengqing Lane, Belle Road, French Concession. Because it was too late, the entire interviewing department was mobilized and interviewed separately. However, because it was too late and urgently needed to be printed, it had to be recorded briefly, so it was the first to be disclosed independently. Now, the detailed situation of the case is continued below.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Robbery Begins <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Hongda Meat Shop at No. 881 Jisi Phil Road, West Shanghai, is opened by a local Dai Pengxi. Because Dai is a member of the Caobao Land Defence Corps, his shop has a No. 3438 handgun issued by the corps. On the evening of the 4th of this month, (that is, the Mid-Autumn Festival in the old calendar) at about 9:00 p.m., when Dai and the shop assistants were drinking festival wine in the shop, four bandits suddenly came in, each with a handgun, forbidding any noise. They robbed the relief fund of 1,200 yuan in the safe and a No. 3438 handgun, containing six bullets, and fled out of the door. They were heard by Gong Shaofu, the seventh guard of the place, and others, and immediately rushed to arrest them. When the bandits saw this, they opened fire and shot, resisting arrest. The police also drew their guns and returned fire. For a time, the sound of gunfire was as dense as a continuous string of pearls. Pedestrians on the road ran away in all directions. The bandits were able to take the opportunity to escape into the crowd without a trace. Afterwards, the carrier reported the situation to the Sixth District General Office and requested a pursuit. Our newspaper had a detailed report on the next day.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Mastermind is Detected <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>After the case occurred, Director Wen Hongen, in view of the serious nature of the bandits' firing and resisting arrest, in addition to ordering the Chief of the Sixth District to do his best to investigate, also instructed Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team, to be responsible for handling the case, in the hope of solving the case in the near future. Therefore, Captain Lu turned to inform all the detectives of his team and the Sixth District to solve the case within a limited time. After various efforts by the officers, it was learned that the case was actually instigated by Meng Linhai, a Changzhou native (22 years old), who had been in charge of the relief house in the village in June of this year. Therefore, detectives were dispatched to arrest Meng at No. 902 Hengtai Meat Shop across from the meat shop at about 9:00 p.m. on the 8th of this month. During the preliminary interrogation in the district, the suspect confessed that he had instigated his accomplices to rob the meat shop. The officers then dispatched personnel to Meng's house at No. 85 Xinkang Lane, Kangnaot Road, and recovered 50 yuan of stolen money, and brought them to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Two More Bandits are Captured <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>After the mastermind Meng Linhai was sent to the General Bureau, Director Wen transferred the case to the detective team to investigate the accomplices. Meng confessed that an accomplice named Wang Guoliang was hiding in Room 26 of Chang Hotel on Wuma Road. Captain Lu then ordered squad leader Liu Changrui to lead detectives Chen Liangfu and others to the hotel at about 9:00 p.m. the night before, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the British Concession Police Station, and arrested the bandit Wang Guoliang and brought him back to the team. During the preliminary interrogation by the captain, he confessed that he was 25 years old, a local, and had previously opened a meat shop. Later, due to poor business, the shop was closed. The case of the robbery of the Hongda Meat Shop was indeed initiated by Meng Linhai, who had been in charge of the relief house in the shop, and was instigated by a certain Shi, who invited me and the fugitives Yan Genxiang, Lu Ziyun, and Zhang Ding to carry out the robbery. The handgun used at the time was issued by his accomplice Chen Bingsheng. Chen's bandit is now hiding in Room 220 of the Sutai Hotel on Sima Road, British Concession. After the interrogation, Liu's squad leader and others, at about 11:00 p.m. that night, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the British Concession Police Station, went to Suzao and arrested Chen's bandit. During the preliminary interrogation by the team, the bandit Chen Bingsheng confessed that he was 38 years old, from Shanghai. He also confessed that he had issued handguns and other items to Wang Guoliang and others to rob the Hongda Meat Shop, and also confessed that all the handguns were now hidden in the pavilion of the house at No. 12 Hengqing Lane, Belle Road, French Concession, in the house of his accomplice.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Double Arrest and Resistance <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>After Chen's bandit finished his confession, Captain Lu did not stay because the bandit had confessed the location of the weapons. He immediately ordered squad leader Liu Changrui to take detectives Chen Liangfu, Gong Hexiang, Ni Ziyu, and others to escort the bandit Chen Bingsheng to the French Concession General Patrol Room and requested to dispatch personnel to assist in the arrest. The head of the patrol assigned Russian detective Mao Zhulaofu (52 years old) and Chinese detective Zixiang No. 20 to go straight to No. 12 Hengqing Lane and knock on the door to enter. When they reached the side of the stairs, they suddenly saw the light in the pavilion go out. Not long after, it was bright again. The Chinese and Western detectives then walked up the stairs and pushed open the door of the pavilion. They saw a man and a woman lying in the room, but the man was lying on the bed with his hands behind his back. The Chinese and Western detectives did not pay attention to this and entered the pavilion one after another. First, they arrested the woman, and then questioned the man lying on the bed about his background. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly jumped up from the bed, each hand holding a gun, and suddenly opened fire on the detectives. For a time, the sound of ping pong was as dense as a string of pearls. The detectives were caught off guard and fell to the ground one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Two Dead and Three Injured <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>When the light in the pavilion went out, the violent bandit had already discovered that the detectives were coming to arrest him. Therefore, after turning off the light first, he took out a shell gun and a Browning handgun from the bed, held the guns in both hands, and put them behind his back. Then he turned on the light and saw the detectives entering the room, so he opened fire and resisted arrest. At that time, Russian detective Mao Zhulaofu was first shot multiple times in the chest by the bandit, and the left chest of the detective Gong Hexiang was also shot once. Both of them fell to the ground and died. Squad leader Liu Changrui was shot once under his left neck and once in his left abdomen, and fell to the ground in pain. Detective Chen Liangfu had his right middle finger broken by a bullet and his right abdomen grazed by a bullet. Chinese detective Zixiang had his chest grazed by a bullet. Only Ni Ziyu was not shot because he was standing outside the door of the pavilion. At that time, the bandit Chen Bingsheng, who was being escorted to be captured, and the woman who had been captured, took the opportunity to escape. However, Chen's bandit ran up to the drying platform and climbed the roof of the three-story building, and fled away. However, because both hands were handcuffed, his actions were inconvenient, so he did not escape a few steps. Accidentally, he lost his footing and fell from the roof, breaking his head and forehead and shattering his brain. He was unconscious.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Second Fierce Battle <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The violent bandit who opened fire and resisted arrest in the pavilion saw that the detectives were either dead or injured, and took the opportunity to rush out of the pavilion, run to the drying platform, jump onto the roof, and escape to the road from the adjacent Xinling Village. He saw a rickshaw with French Concession Permit No. 3648 and Chinese Concession Permit No. 14811 parked on the side of the road, so he jumped on and ordered the rickshaw puller Cao Wenrong (from Jiangbei) to quickly pull him to Malishi. Cao replied that he did not have a British permit. The bandit ordered him to pull him to the end of Belle Road and agreed on a fare of 400 wen. Cao then flew away. When the rickshaw reached the intersection of Laushenfu Road, a patrol team from the French Concession Police Station came face to face, consisting of one Chinese police and two Russian police. Seeing that the bandit looked flustered, they ordered him to stop for inspection. When the bandit saw this, he pulled out a box gun and opened fire, and at the same time jumped out of the car and hid in the Wufeng Lane on the side of the road, resisting stubbornly. The police also opened fire and returned fire. For a time, the sound of gunfire and police sirens were mixed together.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Violent Bandit is Captured <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>As the second fierce battle began, the bandit's box cannon bullets were not enough to load, so he reached into his pocket and took out a Browning handgun and continued to resist arrest. At this time, the bandit had been shot several times. As a result, Chinese police officer Li Tiqing No. 19 bravely stepped forward and hugged the bandit around the waist, snatching the handgun and capturing him. At this time, inspectors Jin Jiulin, Zhang Ziying, and Lu Zhulin of the French Concession Police Station also heard the alarm and rushed to the scene of the incident. They snatched a box gun and 39 bullets, and 22 handgun bullets from the wounded bandit. At this time, the ambulance also arrived and sent the bandit to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. After the bandit was captured, the police specially summoned the second landlord Du Tangshi for questioning. On the one hand, Inspector Jin Jiulin and others tried their best to investigate and learned that the bandit's name was Chen Weicheng (also known as Hong Yao), from Shaoxing, 34 years old, and had rented the house for only four days.</p>
<h3 id="e147">A Tragic Scene <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>As the tragedy was about to end, Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, had received the news and immediately led squad leader Chen Caifu, detectives Wu Songshan Zhao Deren, Gao Quchuan, and others to Hengqing Lane. They saw Western detective Mao Zhulaofu lying in the pavilion, Gong Hexiang falling on the frame of the pavilion, and Liu Changrui falling on the stairs. Fresh red blood flowed all over the pavilion and the stairs. Together with the personnel of the French Concession Police Station, they sent the injured detectives to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, Mao Zhulaofu and Gong Hexiang had already died. They were immediately transferred to the Tongren Fuyuantang Coffin Shop. The bandit Chen Bingsheng, who fell from the roof, was also sent to the hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital without being treated.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Injured are Generally the Same <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>After the doctors of the hospital diagnosed the injured detectives, Liu Changrui's abdomen was shot through the large intestine and broke five places. Therefore, an operation was performed at about 1:00 a.m. today to try to clamp out the bullets in his intestine and under his neck, and cut off his broken large intestine. However, due to the severity of his injuries, his life was still in danger. Also, detective Chen Liangfu had his right middle finger broken by a bullet. After the doctor bandaged it, he was kept in the hospital for treatment. The violent bandit Chen Weicheng, who was captured, was seriously injured and his life was also in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Court Examination of Corpses <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The corpse of the Russian detective who died on the spot was transported by the patrol wagon to the mortuary of the Public Works Department hospital on Thälmann Road. The corpses of Detective Gong and the thief Chen, were sent to the examination hall of the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor. Immediately reported to the Second Special District Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Wang Ren, forensic doctors, clerks, etc., to first arrive at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall at 10:30 AM to examine the bodies. Prosecutor ascended to the courtroom. Patrolman Wang Licheng reported the preceding events. Subsequently, witness Ni Ziyu, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, provided an account of the situation at the time. The official announcement stated that Gong Yongxiang died from a gunshot wound sustained during his lifetime. As his family had not arrived, his colleague Ni Ziyu provided a guarantee to claim the body for burial. It was further announced that the bandit Chen Bingsheng died from injuries sustained from jumping. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. After the examination, they proceeded to Thälmann Road to examine the Russian detective's corpse again. The body was instructed to be taken care of by the Public Works Department. The prosecutor returned to the court after the examination, which was already 1 PM.</p>

<p>As for Detective Gong's body, team leader Lu Ying筹 prepared a high-quality coffin and burial clothing. The body was prepared for burial yesterday afternoon, and the funeral is scheduled for 2 PM today. It is reported that Gong was not yet married and was twenty-nine years old this year. The wedding was scheduled for the middle of next month. He had only been a detective for three months before he suddenly met his unfortunate demise. Moreover, he has elderly parents at home, and the deceased was their only son. Therefore, after Team Leader Lu reported to the bureau chief, Bureau Chief Wen expressed great regret. In addition to ordering a grand burial, he also issued 200 yuan to the family in advance. After the case is concluded, he will find ways to provide relief to console the loyal soul and set an example for the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cage Bird Association held a bird competition for its members at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road the day before yesterday. Approximately several hundred birds were brought by members to participate, with hibiscus birds being the most numerous. There were Chinese, English, Dutch, German, and other varieties. The remaining birds were divided into two categories: Chinese and Western insect-eating birds and grain-eating birds. Some were known for their singing, while others were known for their color. Judges classified and evaluated the birds, and prizes were awarded to the winners. Chinese and Westerners visited from morning to night in an endless stream. The association was established in the autumn of last year and currently has dozens of members, with Westerners accounting for about sixty percent. Last year, they were invited by the Gardening Association to display and compete at the racecourse, which was well received by the audience.

<h3 id="e152">British Merchant in Liverpool Willing to Promote Chinese Fruit Consul stationed in Liverpool reports on the fruit situation there Attention should be paid to the selection and shipping of the first batch <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Since the International Trade Bureau promoted the export of Chinese fruit, domestic merchants have paid close attention. Yesterday, the International Trade Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, which were forwarded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the report of Tao Yin, the vice-consul stationed in Liverpool, on the fruit industry there. It is valuable to the mirror of Chinese fruit merchants. The original presentation says, "Regarding the matter of requesting a report, I have already reported the matter of promoting Chinese fruit on March 20. Now, according to a Reuters report in Shanghai, the International Trade Bureau is shipping a batch of fruit to Liverpool. Various merchants have inquired at this consulate for confirmation. I have already sent a report requesting your ministry to inquire. Since this news was published, this consulate has gone to the local fruit exchange, intending to have British merchants directly contact our merchants. However, most merchants are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Because Chinese fruit has never been shipped to England, the future market is difficult to determine. In addition, the tariff difference and competition are fierce, so they dare not purchase rashly, fearing losses. If the first batch of our goods to England is poorly selected or improperly shipped, once it fails, it will be difficult to develop in the future. We must be cautious. This consulate will conduct a detailed investigation of the fruit market and list it in detail so that it can be communicated to Chinese merchants. (1) In addition to wholesale and retail, the fruit trade in this city also has an exchange, which is held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM. (2) Packing boxes: The dimensions of the goods from various places are uniform: box length 26 inches, height 11 1/2 inches, width 11 1/2 inches, wood board thickness 1/2 inch. Two wooden strips, each 26 inches long, 5 1/2 inches wide, and 1/4 inch thick, are nailed to each side. Wooden strips are also nailed to the bottom and lid of the wooden box. (3) The weight of each box of fruit ranges from 68 pounds to 76 pounds. (4) Market price: According to the exchange price list on August 23, oranges are priced from 10 shillings 6 pence to 18 shillings 6 pence per box, and pears are priced from 15 shillings 6 pence to 19 shillings per box. However, the price fluctuates from time to time and is difficult to standardize. (5) Tariffs: Oranges from British territories are exempt from tax from April 1 to November 30. Oranges from other places are taxed at 3 shillings 6 pence per 112 pounds net weight. From December 1 to March 31, a tax of 10% of the value is levied. Pears from British territories are tax-free. Pears from other places are taxed at 4 shillings 6 pence per 112 pounds net weight. Therefore, our goods have the same tariffs as those from the United States, Italy, Spain, and Brazil, and there are differences with Australia, South Africa, and Canada. (6) Transportation: There are two direct shipping companies between China and England: the British Company and the Blue Funnel Company. However, the journey is long and requires refrigerated storage, so the freight is more expensive than those from Europe and the United States. It is difficult to obtain a standard freight rate here. The freight rate depends entirely on the degree of negotiation between merchants. In short, if Chinese merchants want to operate, they can write directly to this consulate, or J.C. Houghton &amp; Co., I. Temple Court, Liverpool, telegraph registration No. Noughton Liverpool, or G.H. Cooper Horden &amp; Co., 35 Victoria St., Liverpool, telegraph registration Copper Liverpod, because these two businesses have expressed their willingness to try Chinese goods. All the investigations on the fruit business are listed here for your review and processing, and I pray for instructions to follow. Sincerely presented by Tao Yin, Vice Consul stationed in Liverpool.</p>

<p>The Railway Bureau wrote to us stating: "Since the Jinghu and Huhangyong Railways have taken back the catering services on passenger trains, they have given priority to using domestic products for various food and beverage raw materials. The tea and fruits used on the tide-watching special train this time are Qimen black tea, which is of course a domestic product. The Western-style snacks are also entrusted to Ruichang Food Store to provide, and are not purchased from foreigners. Even when the dining car was contracted by the dining car contractor in previous years, it did not require Longjing tea or West Lake lotus root flour, let alone prohibit the sale. This special train is entirely for sightseeing purposes, and is not attached to third-class passenger cars due to engine traction considerations, so it is not a matter of discrimination against the general public. As for other allegations such as prohibiting the sale of domestic food and beverages and limiting the sale of foreign goods, treating domestic goods as enemies, they are far from the truth and not worth the smile of knowledgeable people."</p>

<p>The Female Voice Society of this city, in order to hold a one-week anniversary, in addition to publishing a special issue on the 25th of this month and soliciting 10,000 new subscribers, has also purchased many prizes such as silver cups, silver shields, and award flags to hold an election for "Female Great People," with a quota of ten people, five from history and five from modern times. It is reported that the society has drafted eight articles of election instructions and organized a committee to be responsible for the process. Here are the important points of its explanation: (1) "Female Voice" is the only publication for modern women, aiming to awaken women's self-consciousness and promote the success of the Chinese women's movement. (2) "Female Voice" has been published for exactly one year since its release. In order to celebrate the past and encourage young women to work hard for their families, countries, and society, and to test the Chinese people's views on "Female Great People," the top three winners from history will be asked to have their closest relatives or friends receive the awards on their behalf. (3) Those who are concubines, have incomplete private morals, or smoke opium will not be selected. (4) Female Great People include politicians, educators, medical scientists, social reformers, artists, and others who focus on the happiness of the people. All of the above are eligible to be selected. (5) The results of the Female Great People competition will be announced in newspapers on New Year's Day in 1934, and the history and life of the selected people will be published in "Female Voice." (6) All voters must be citizens of the Republic of China and must indicate their name and address on the ballot and mail the ballot to the Female Great People Election Committee of the Female Voice Society, No. 508, No. 23 Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai before November 30. (7) The Female Great People competition has a quota of ten people, five from history and five from modern times. (8) The ballots received will be sealed and kept by the committee.

<p>A few days ago, Jones, the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau, on behalf of the board of directors of the bureau, sent a letter to Accountant Pan Xulun, director of the Lixin Accounting Firm, inviting him to serve as the permanent auditor of the bureau and its various departments. The term of office will begin on October 1 of this year, and he is requested to consult with Ford, the director of the bureau's finance department, and Tomson, the Western auditor, to discuss specific auditing methods. It is reported that Accountant Pan has agreed to accept this position and has already made contact with Director Ford of the bureau's finance department. He will start work soon. It is also heard that this auditing work is of a continuous inspection nature. Because the Public Works Bureau has many agencies and a large amount of revenue and expenditure, Accountant Pan must bring along assistant accountants to the bureau for auditing on a regular basis. The revenue and expenditure accounts of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau were originally audited annually by the British accounting firm Tomson &amp; Co. The proposal to hire a Chinese accountant to serve as an auditor was initiated by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association last year. Most of the tax revenue in the Public Concession is borne by the Chinese, so there should be an accountant who can represent the Chinese to audit the revenue and expenditure accounts in order to gain the trust of the Chinese community. This matter was decided by the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau this summer. Later, the Chinese and Western directors carefully considered the issue of candidates, and it was only recently that they decided to hire Accountant Pan.</p>

<p>At around 4 PM the day before yesterday, Dong Mingde, squad leader of the First District General Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Deputy squad leader Han Ruisheng, along with detectives Yu Maojiang, Zhang Zhongliang, Yang Shilin, Guo Shiqing, etc., were patrolling their jurisdiction when they saw a man wearing a black short shirt and pants walking north from outside the Xiaonanmen Hugujun camp. When he caught sight of the detectives, he immediately appeared flustered. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest him and brought him back to the district. Under strict interrogation by District Chief Guan Gong, he confessed his name as Lü Xiaoqing, also known as Zan Erdi, 30 years old this year, from Yancheng. On the 29th of last month, he and his accomplices Ding Yousan, Yang Wanquan, Qi Yuebin, etc., carrying handguns, went to the Deda silk thread store outside the Xiaonanmen Wangjia Mouth to rob several tens of yuan in banknotes and foreign currency, which they divided and spent. Later, at around 6 PM on the 8th of this month, he and Ding Yousan again went to the Bin He Shen coal store to rob 225 jiao in small foreign currency. At that time, the manager of the store followed and shouted for the police. In a moment of panic, he opened fire and shot him dead. He said that the handgun was hidden by him under a cabinet in the front building of No. 9 Jiakangli, Gaochang Temple, and that he had originally agreed with Ding Yousan, etc., to meet at a small teahouse near the Hugujun camp at 5 PM today to discuss further "business." After District Chief heard the confession, he immediately dispatched squad leader Dong Mingde, etc., to escort the suspect to wait at a small teahouse near the Hugujun camp. At around 6 PM, Ding and Yang thieves swaggered over, and they rushed forward and arrested the two thieves and brought them back to the district. During the preliminary interrogation, Ding Yousan confessed that he was 28 years old, from Yancheng, and did not deny the robbery of the Deda Silk Thread Store and the Bao He Shen record. Yang Wanquan confessed that he was 25 years old, from Yancheng, and that he went to the Deda Silk Thread Store with Lü Xiaoqing, Ding Yousan, etc., but that he did not go with them to the Bao He Shen record because he had other important matters. Subsequently, Dong Mingde, etc., found out that Qi Yuebin, an accomplice of Lü, etc., often bathed in the Weiquan Garden Bathhouse in Lujiabang, so they went to the address and arrested Qi and brought him back to the district. During questioning by the district chief, he confessed that he often extorted people with hooligans, but that he had not partnered with Lu, etc., to rob. Immediately after, squad leader Dong, etc., were dispatched to search Qi's home at No. 7, Alley 18, Hainan West Lane, Chaozisi Road, where they found four iron bars and one axe. They then went with Zhou Zhicheng, a patrolman from the Second District, to search under a cabinet in the front building of No. 9 Jiakangli, Gaochang Temple, where they found an eight-inch Browning handgun and one bullet. After bringing them back to the district, they summoned Qian Dechang, the accountant of the Bao He Shen Coal Store, and Shen Zenghai, an apprentice, to the district to identify the thief Lü Xiaoqing as the one who was present at the scene of the robbery and shot and killed manager Xie Jiuxiang. A document was immediately prepared and the witnesses were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Shen Yongjun, a student at Jiangnan College, is 24 years old. His ancestral home is Chongde, Zhejiang. His father ran Tianyi Silk Shop and Dayouheng Rice Shop, Dayouben Bank, and Daxingheng Department Store at 19 Xiangfen Lane, and his assets was tens of thousands, all of which was inherited by Shen. He had a habit of wasting money, and he often visited dance halls and theaters after class. In February of this year, he was introduced to Wang Meizhen, a dancer at the Dadong Dance Hall, by his fellow villager Sun Hanying. Wang is also from Chongde, and the two were unusually intimate. Meizhen is twenty-one years old. Her father, Wenfu, ran a grocery store in Chongyi, which was still enough to make ends meet. Three years ago, he died of an epidemic, leaving behind沈氏 and two daughters. Meizhen is the eldest. Because no one was taking care of the store, it was closed down. From then on, the family's finances declined and gradually became unable to survive. Meizhen attended Chongde Elementary School as a child. Last year, she saw an advertisement in the newspaper for a film company recruiting actors, so she came to Shanghai with her mother and sister. However, due to problems, she was unable to become a movie star, so she became a dance star. After getting to know Yongjun, they became intimate friends, inseparable. Her mother, Shen, initially did not think much of it, but after learning that Yongjun was willing to spend his life with her daughter, she asked Sun XX Yingwang Chenglong to be matchmakers. After the engagement, the family's livelihood was entirely dependent on Yongjun, who gave them 150 yuan a month. In March, taking advantage of Shen's absence, Yongjun went to Meizhen's home at No. 17 in the Yongnian Black Seventeenth on Baker Road and stayed with Meizhen. But once Yongjun achieved his goal, he suddenly changed his mind. Not only did he postpone the marriage, but his feelings also became more and more distant, and he eventually stopped going to the woman's house. Even when they met, it was as if they did not know each other, causing Meizhen to be filled with shame and anger. She has now hired lawyer Pan Xi to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Local Court against Shen Yongjun for seduction and abandonment, requesting punishment according to the law and compensation of 50,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the court to summon him for questioning. The defendant failed to appear, and Wang Meizhen recounted in detail the circumstances of her relationship with Shen. The court ruled that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

They tricked the door open, entered the room, and brandished handguns, threatening and intimidating the entire family, including the owner and servants. They were imprisoned in the厢房. One thief held a gun to guard them, while the remaining thieves went upstairs, ransacking boxes and cabinets. They robbed more than 700 yuan in banknotes and foreign currency, a diamond ring, a treasure ring, pearl hairpins, and gold bracelets, with an estimated value of more than 1,000 yuan. After obtaining the stolen goods, the thieves left swaggeringly. Afterwards, the owner prepared a list of losses and reported it to the Second Branch Office of the First District Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Xie Changshun, 22 years old, from Baoying, lives in a straw shed north of the Yongyu Yarn Factory on Xiaoshadu Creek. He works as a bricklayer under the foreman Guo Renjie, who lives nearby. He married a woman named Lü, 24 years old this year, who is slightly attractive. Guo Renmao, Guo Renjie's younger brother, also lives nearby and is very lustful. He seduced the woman into an affair. At midnight on the 11th of this month, Xie returned home and saw Guo Renmao having a secret meeting with the woman. When Guo saw Xie return, he fled naked. Xie grabbed him. Guo Renjie learned of the matter and arrived with his brother-in-law Xia Youcai to mediate. Guo Renmao was handed over to Guo Renjie, and the woman was handed over to Xia Youcai, so that they could resolve the matter the next day. But the next day, both Guo Renmao and the woman were reported missing. Xie then accused Guo Renjie and Xia Youcai of obstructing marriage and reported them to the police, who transferred them to the local court for detention. Unexpectedly, after Xie returned home, he found his wife's body in the creek of the Dafeng Yarn Factory and had already been sent to the Rescue Bureau by the water patrol police for examination. He thought that the woman must have committed suicide by drowning because she was ashamed to face people, and that Guo Renmao must have fled to avoid punishment. However, Xie believed that his family's ruin was due to the harm of these people, so he filed a complaint with the local court yesterday, requesting a report.</p>

<p>Recently, the Meilin Canned Food Company has observed that the import of canned food, although a small item, results in tens of millions of dollars flowing out of the country annually in customs duties. Therefore, in 1931, the owner of the factory gathered experienced talents in the industry to form an organization with initial capital of only 6,000 yuan. The chili sauce and tomato juice produced were sold in the market and were greatly praised, with demand exceeding supply. This led to discussions on expanding the organization, and in September 1932, the capital was increased from 6,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan. A factory was built on Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai, and foreign experts were hired to process and manufacture products, striving to compete with imported goods. It was recently reported that after the establishment of the new factory, various products such as French-style green beans, American-style sweet green beans, fresh pearls, fresh tomatoes, pears, apples, apricots, and peaches all have natural fresh flavors. There are also sour pickles, tomato juice, and baking powder, all made from high-quality raw materials, so the color, aroma, and taste are excellent, and the appearance and decoration are comparable to imported products. All colleagues in the industry are willing to promote the products, which is good news during this period of rural bankruptcy.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency) The National Games' men's and women's swimming competition began this morning at the swimming pool. Chief Referee Wang Zhengting presided over the event in person. Due to the limited space in the swimming pool, the organizing committee restricted access in advance. Only swimming officials and reporters were allowed in, and other officials and guests had to purchase tickets for five jiao. Therefore, the order was well maintained.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Preliminary Predictions for Men's and Women's Swimming <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th) On the first day of swimming, two national records were broken in the morning and one in the afternoon. The National Games swimming championship will be held at 8:00 AM on the 16th. To maintain order, the organizing committee raised the ticket price to five jiao per ticket and deployed Boy Scouts and guards, resulting in exceptionally strict security and good order. Only a thousand spectators were present. As 8:00 AM approached, the report was called, and the athletes emerged in an orderly fashion. The first event was the men's 50m freestyle, with a total of 47 participants, divided into seven groups. Chen Zhenxing and Chen Qisong of Guangdong, who have beautiful posture and strong wrists, are the most promising in this category. Yang Xiuqiong of Hong Kong is the best in the women's 50m freestyle, which has long been well-known. Her result of 39 seconds is indeed remarkable. According to her coach, her result in Hong Kong was only 32 seconds, and it is predicted that she will definitely win the women's individual championship in this competition. In the 400m freestyle, the younger brother of the Shi family, Xingzhi, is also expected to win the championship. It is said that Shi practices for four hours every day from morning to night. Although his posture is not perfect, his strength is unmatched in the country. Breaking the national record is the result of his hard work. In the final race, Chen Qisong is the only one with the qualifications to win the championship. Guo Zhenheng has a reputation as a great swimmer in Hong Kong. In this event, Guo swims 100m freestyle and 200m breaststroke intermittently. However, breaststroke is inherently a slow swimming style and cannot compete with freestyle. His current result is not bad, and he may have a chance to come in third in the final. In the 100m backstroke, Shi Jinpei, Chen Zhenxing, and Liu Baoxi all use a single-arm stroke. Yang Henghua once broke the national record with a time of 1:29, which is only a foot away from the national record. The winner of this final will be one of these four. In the women's 100m backstroke, Yang Xiuqiong will definitely win the championship in the final.</p>

<p>The men's tennis semi-finals will begin at 9:00 AM this morning. Shanghai's Qiu Feihai will compete against Overseas Chinese's Xu Chengji, representing the first singles match between Shanghai and Overseas Chinese. Both players have superb skills and are sure to put on an excellent performance. The Overseas Chinese team has forfeited the doubles match, so the outcome of the second singles match is crucial. Shanghai's representative is expected to be Wang Wenzheng. If Mr. Wang does appear, he must remain calm and composed, as the Overseas Chinese team's Lin Xuyin is also a first-class talent. Sichuan is likely to win against Hebei, as Sichuan has famous players Lin Baohua and Qian Yaobin.</p>
<h3 id="e208">First Singles <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th) The four men's tennis matches on the morning of the 16th were all the first singles. The match between Xu Chengji of the Overseas Chinese team and Gao Huimin of Beiping attracted attention this morning. The match between Wang Wenzheng of Shanghai and Xu Huipei of Guangdong was extremely tense. The strength of Jin Huisheng of Hebei and Sun Changquan of Rehe was equal. The match between Lin Baohua of Sichuan and Ma Shaobo of Beijing was one-sided. The results were as follows: Lin Baohua of Sichuan defeated Ma Shaobo of Beijing 6-3, 6-0, 6-0. Xu Chengji of the Overseas Chinese team defeated Gao Huimin of Beiping 6-2, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4. Jin Huisheng of Hebei defeated Sun Changquan of Rehe 2-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4.

<h3 id="e209">Xu Chengji is After All a Formidable Opponent; Wins Against Gao Huimin of Beiping 3-1; Talent Fully Displayed <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Xu Chengji, the 20-year-old tennis player from the Overseas Chinese team, is truly a force to be reckoned with. His cannonball serves are even better than Lin Baohua, and his volleying is more agile than Qiu Feihai. His sharp shots are excellent, but his backhand is weaker. His positioning and footwork are top-notch, but he seems to lack experience and often misses opportunities. Gao Huimin of Beiping is a famous player in North China, known to all. His tennis skills have improved recently. His serves and volleys are skillful. The third set was a victory and the fourth was a fierce battle. His talent is fully displayed and is by no means accidental, but Xu never took off his sweatshirt, even though the sun was scorching.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Instant Success <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>At the start of the match, Gao Huimin served, and both players volleyed. Gao took the first game. Xu served and won four consecutive points. After Gao won the service game again, Xu went on a smooth run, attacking from all directions and achieving success everywhere. Gao made mistakes from time to time and lost control, unable to find a solution. Xu then won the first set 6-1. At the start of the second set, Gao won all his serves. In a 1-3 game, Xu won four powerful serves to tie the service game. From then on, he gained momentum and repeatedly won with volleys, remaining stable and alert. Gao's shots and advanced skills were all repelled, leaving him with no way out. He lost again 1-6.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Sudden Change in Situation <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>After losing two consecutive sets, Gao tried to retaliate. At the start of the third set, his momentum suddenly surged, using sharp and rapid shots to break through Xu's volleys, and Xu also made mistakes from time to time, with his serves often losing points. Gao managed to take the lead with a score of 4-2. Xu won all his serves, and Gao then made it 5-3. Xu also added a game, making it 5-4. Gao served, and there was a fierce battle between the two sides, but Xu lost due to a net ball. Gao then won a set 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Solidifying Victory <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Gao continued to perform well in the fourth set, preventing Xu Chengji from being too casual. After winning the first game, Gao used the concept ball to attack towards the boundary, but Xu's volleying was ineffective, resulting in a tie. After that, each won their serves, repeatedly resulting in a tie, and it was difficult to tell who was superior. However, Xu benefited from the priority of serving, so he always took the lead. After 4-4, Xu won the service game again, while Gao lost his service game due to two failed volleys. Xu then won again with a score of 6-4.</p>

<p>Qiu Feihai, a great general from Shanghai, has already arrived in Nanjing. However, in the first singles match between Shanghai and Guangdong on the 16th morning, Shanghai still sent Wang Wenzheng into the fray. This was because Qiu was conserving his energy, preparing for a major battle with Xu Chengji from Batavia in the semi-finals. However, Xu Huipeng from Guangdong, a promising young talent whose skills were similar to Wang Wenzheng's, was not to be underestimated. In this morning's match, Wang Wenzheng almost lost. After a fierce battle of five sets, Wang finally won three sets to two, a victory that can be said to have been achieved at great risk.</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Beginning of the Match <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>

Wang's brilliance was fully revealed, winning four games in a row and taking the lead with a score of 5-2. In the eighth game, Xu served and held an absolute advantage with a score of 40-0. However, Wang remained calm and dealt with the situation, winning the game and securing the first set with a score of 6-2.</p>

Wang took the game with a clever four, taking the lead with a score of 6-5. When Xu served, Wang had a great chance to win. However, due to excessive carelessness, he lost the game, resulting in a 6-6 tie. Afterwards, Wang lost his service game, and ultimately Wang lost with a score of 6-8.</p>

<p>In the third set, Xu worked hard to attack, winning the first two games. Wang quickly caught up, pulling back one game. Then Wang used a diversionary tactic, making Xu run back and forth. However, Xu ran quickly and responded with ease, and Wang's plan failed. He lost again with a score of 4-6. Thus, Xu came from behind with a score of two sets to one.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Rapidly Changing Situation <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>

Fortunately, Wang rallied his spirits and dealt with the situation calmly, winning four games in a row and winning the fourth set with a score of 7-5, stabilizing the overall situation. In the fifth set, Wang had smooth sailing, with overwhelming momentum. Xu made frequent mistakes and ran slowly, completely different from before. From the beginning of the match, Wang controlled everything, and ultimately won with a score of 6-1. In total, Wang defeated Xu with a score of three sets to two.</p>

<p>The first singles match between Lin Baohua from Sichuan, who is always victorious, and Ma Shaobo from Nanjing was a one-sided affair. Ma showed courage at the beginning, in the first set.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the following two sets, he ran back and forth, exhausted from responding. Lin Baohua managed everything with ease, like mercury flowing down, entering every gap. He won twelve games in a row, without appearing to exert any effort. As a result of the three sets, Lin only lost three games.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Yu Tianguang's Loss is a Pity, Losing to Li Guangjun by Two Sets to Three <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Li Guangjun, a veteran from the South, showed his power from the start. His tennis skills are even better than when he was in Shanghai a few years ago. He is brave and good at fighting, and heroic. Yu Tianguang is a famous young player from Shanghai, with profound skills. The two players put on a wonderful performance, which was praised by the audience. Yu took the lead with one effort, unstoppable. Although Li was brave, he had to admit defeat. Yu won two consecutive sets with a score of 6-4 and 6-1. Although the situation was extremely fierce, Yu's victory seemed quite easy.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Losing Three Games in a Row <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>In the third set, Yu's vigor was still strong, with powerful groundstrokes and fast serves. He once led with a score of 4-1, thinking that he could win in three straight sets. At this time, Li Guangjun suddenly emerged, making miraculous achievements and achieving a tie at 4-4. However, Yu did not show any weakness, proceeding cautiously, and always taking advantage of the priority of serving. Li followed closely, but Yu failed to complete this set by winning two consecutive games. Instead, Li won with a score of 10-8. Afterwards, Yu's energy was exhausted, and he made frequent mistakes. In addition, the referee Zhao Minheng made a series of mistakes, and unfortunately, they all went against Yu. Yu was unable to recover, and lost the fourth set with a score of 2-6. In the final deciding set, Li took an extreme advantage with a score of 5-1. Yu Tianguang made a comeback, catching up with two games before losing. Li then won with a score of 3-2. Fortunately, Shanghai had already eliminated Guangdong with a score of 2-0, so the outcome of this group was not significant.</p>

<p>Having exhausted all his anger, after Xu Chengji from Batavia defeated Ping Gaohuimin in the morning, whether to advance or retreat depended on the second singles match between Lin Xuyin and He Yuqing from Ping. Because Batavia had no doubles players, they had to forfeit. Lin and He faced each other at 3 p.m. Both players had no anger in their tennis skills, but they were a pair of chewing gums. Xu specialized in slicing the ball and going to the net, getting what he wanted from left and right, and won two consecutive games with scores of 6-1 and 6-3 without much effort. However, He showed great courage in the third set, with few mistakes, while Lin showed signs of fatigue. He pulled back with a score of 6-3. In the fourth set, Lin showed his brilliance again, winning again with a score of 6-2. In total, Batavia eliminated Peiping with a score of 2-1. Xu Chengji meeting Qiu Feihai on the 17th will be a major match rarely seen in recent years, competing for the final spot.</p>

<p>One Level Higher. The second singles match between Qian Yaobin from Sichuan and Li Pizu from Peiping began at 3 p.m. Li Pizu's skills were still considerable, but Qian Yaobin's groundstrokes were powerful, and he pressed hard from the beginning, which can be said to be one level higher.

<p>A Bland Performance. The Guangdong doubles match started at 2 p.m. Shanghai sent the great generals Qiu Feihai and Zheng Zhaojia to fight, facing Chen Zhiqiang and Liu Fuling from Guangdong.

<p>(Nanjing, 16th) In the women's volleyball semi-final, Guangdong vs. Hebei, held at 9 a.m. on the 16th, both teams had strong strength. In terms of individual skills, Hebei's front row could kill but was not good at defending, which was a shortcoming. The middle and back row had great mobility. Guangdong's talents were relatively average, and their setting and passing had their own characteristics. Xiao Huiling was a celestial killer, attacking in the front and defending in the back, which can be described as a core and complete material.</p>

<p>After the start of the match, Wang Hengyun from Hebei served and committed suicide. Bao Yizheng from Guangdong quickly showed her abilities, going left and right, front and back, with no fixed ball direction. Although Guangdong was active and pleasing, Hebei's brute force was superior, which was not to be underestimated. In the first game, Guangdong won by only five points, with a score of 21-18.</p>

<p>In the second game, Guangdong served good balls in a row, often with the ball landing in the middle area. It was difficult for Hebei generals to save it by killing to the back sideline. Therefore, Hebei was able to save a tie with a score of 21-17.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Suddenly Rising <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>In the third game, Hebei's momentum remained strong. In the first half, they were still ahead with a score of 11-9. Turning around, the sunlight was strong, and facing the strong sun, the ball was often unpredictable. Guangdong then suddenly rose at the same time with the same score of 12, surpassing the Hebei team. As a result, they won the third game again with a score of 21-17.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Heart-Stirring and Panic-Stricken <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth game, Guangdong took advantage of the victory to pursue and tighten the pressure. Sun Xian served and scored six points. Hebei spectators cherished the national spirit, and when seeing the Guangdong army arrogant, they could not help but cheer from the sidelines, but seeking victory too eagerly made the soldiers heart-stirring and panic-stricken. Therefore, they suffered a big defeat in the first half with a difference of 1-11. After changing sides, the sunlight reflected, and the Guangdong army suffered greatly, losing eight points in a row. At this time, the situation was very tense. After all, the athletes in the South were as calm as ever, and began to turn the tide with a score of 21-8 and win the semi-final spot. The overall result was 3-1. The referee was Li Yunfei.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 16th) In the women's volleyball semi-final Shanghai vs. Fujian, as soon as the battle curtain was opened, Xiao Xiaogu from Shanghai first raised her jade arm, and the ball came out with a sound, falling quickly in Fujian's back row. Chen Jinxiang came quickly, squatted and passed it out, but before reaching the opposite area, the front row was busy defending the net, and fouled, losing a point first. The whole team silently believed that it was unfavorable to send troops. Shanghai then attacked again, with excellent landing points. Fujian was unable to cope, watching Xiao Yingjie show her formidable female power alone. Like this, Shanghai had already scored 11 points, while Fujian only had 3 points. After changing sides, the Fujian captain Chen Rongtang greeted the soldiers to defend the land with peace of mind, and personally blocked the net, but because of their small size and weak strength, each serve was slow and high, often taken advantage of by the enemy. The first game was lightly sketched, and the result was 21-7.</p>

<p>In the second game, the Fujian back row did not know what to say. Wang Chunshi, a blonde girl from Shanghai, did not let Xiao Yingjie and Wang Jinfeng show off alone, and served hard. A string of pearls actually built five points alone. Fujian struggled bitterly, scoring only three points in the first half and four points in the second half. Shanghai then won another game with a score of 21.</p>
<h3 id="e242">The Overall Situation is Already Set <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>In the third game, Zhang Biru from Shanghai made two serving errors. The Fujian ladies secretly comforted themselves, but knowing that it would not be long before Shanghai's mortars would come again, waiting to fight back one by one, and the Shanghai front row closed the door tightly, unwilling to let go lightly. Then Fujian understood that the overall situation was already set and no longer wasted energy. The final score of this battle was 21-3. The Shanghai team won the semi-final spot with a score of three to zero. The referee was Qiu Jixiang.</p>

<p>In the women's volleyball semi-final, the Peiping and Hong Kong teams passed the difficult situation at the same time. At 9 a.m. on the 16th, Shanghai vs. Fujian, Guangdong vs. Hebei, one battle, and Shanghai and Guangdong returned at the same time. The semi-final ended here. Returning to the semi-final on the 18th, Shanghai will be matched against Guangdong, and Hong Kong will be against Peiping. The fate of the championship is becoming shorter and shorter.

<p>Result: Three to Zero</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th) In the first men's volleyball match, Shanghai vs. Peiping, the referee was Gao Xiwei. Shanghai's volleyball team had been dormant for a long time, using the first bye to their advantage. The audience at the conference was looking forward to it. At 2 p.m., the small grandstand was already overcrowded.</p>

<p>The two heroes came to the stage. The Shanghai team started the battle first. The Peiping generals echoed each other before and after, closing the door to pass and kill, each with their own responsibilities. The Shanghai generals had been well-trained. No matter how good or bad they came, they were careful to deal with it. But seeing the ball coming out quickly, spinning in the air, the Shanghai generals Xu Heng and Cao Shizan were rude, and while the Peiping team was humble, they still used a big knife to kill the enemy. In the first two games, Shanghai won twice.</p>

<p>Starting from the third game, Peiping decided to block the soldiers and generals. Since the relationship had already been sold, they had to cheer up, or they would be eliminated. So, during the break, they decided on a strategy. When they took the stage in the third game, they immediately showed their colors. Shi Jialiang came to kill two balls first, which was really remarkable. Seeing that the front net of the Shanghai team could not hold, they desperately closed the door, which also proved effective. The result of the first half was 11-8. Although Peiping was still at a disadvantage, the score was gradually approaching. They hoped to deal with it with strength in the second half and reverse the disaster. Unexpectedly, the lucky loser repeatedly blocked the net, all of which were pushed into their own area by the Shanghai team. Then the score was like mercury pouring down, leaving no gap. When the referee sounded the horn, Shanghai had killed the Peiping generals by three to zero.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 16th) In the first match, Hong Kong vs. Fujian, it was inevitable that Hong Kong would take Fujian lightly based on Hong Kong's past record. However, the Fujian team was exceptionally tenacious on this day. Li Genhuan from Fujian served and scored seven consecutive points. Hong Kong underestimated the enemy and almost had problems. They tried their best to turn it around, but had already allowed Fujian to take the lead with a score of 11-6. Once the direction of the change was lost, the strange battle traces also changed along with it. But seeing the Hong Kong front row flying along the net, and the mid-row's setting and the pressure balls of Rong Naichao and Hu Yaodong on both wings, especially appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and making sounds to the east and attacking to the west, the whole field cheered. After so many repetitions, the Hong Kong team actually surpassed and advanced with an equal score. They won the first game with a score of 21-17.</p>

<p>In the second game, the Hong Kong team was even more active. Although Fujian had a serious lineup and calmly resisted, there were many mistakes in the mid-row, and they lost to Hong Kong with a score of 12-21. In the third game, the Hong Kong army's prestige remained. Fujian was not willing to show weakness. Lin Changyuan in the front row had a very wonderful and exquisite pressure ball performance, but the momentum was wrong. Until the referee Gao Xiwei sounded the alarm and closed the troops, they still lost to Hong Kong with a score of 11-21. The result turned into a score of three to zero.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 16th) The women's softball game between Shanghai and Peiping is quite the key to this competition. The Shanghai-Peiping-Guangdong teams are all experts in this area. Peiping, in particular, has won the North China Championship twice in a row, and Shanghai has only undergone short-term training for more than a month, so they are in awe when they hear about it.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Taking the Initiative to Return the Colors <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the Peiping team took the initiative, and Liu Xiaodong and Yao Xiangli ran back two points first. The Shanghai team counterattacked fiercely. The Peiping team made repeated mistakes, and then ran back three points one after another. Ren Shumei, Jian Li, and Cao Huiqiong each set up a move. At the beginning of the second game, Zhong Hansun from the Peiping team ran back and scored one point. Lu Puzhen from the Shanghai team also ran back one point.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Team Also Killed Three Peiping Team Members in a Row. The Third Game Ended Without Any Achievements. At the Beginning of the Fourth Game, the Peiping Team Attacked Violently. Zheng Binghua Ran Back and Scored One Point First. Zhao Jinhan Then Hit a Home Run. Zhong Hansun and Xin Anzhong Also Returned to Home Plate One After Another. In Total, the Peiping Team Scored Four Points in This Game. At This Time, the Situation Was 7 to 4, and Peiping's Victory Went Downhill. The Shanghai Team Was in Imminent Danger.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, when the Shanghai team counterattacked, it went smoothly. Li Shihui ran back one point each to Zhang Rong, Meng Li, Zeng Huiqiong, Tang Yueying, Sun Zhang, Zou Shande, Xu Wenying, and Lu Puzhen. In one fell swoop, the Shanghai team gained nine points. In the fifth game, the Peiping team's counterattack only scored one point. Then the Shanghai team won with a score of 13 to 8 and won the final spot.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Although the Skills are Excellent, a Bad Step is Hateful <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>The Peiping team's skills seem to be better than the Shanghai team. The Shanghai team's victory over the Peiping team benefited from the big score in the fourth game. The Peiping team lost its footing in that game, so there was no way to recover it.</p>

<p>National Elite Gather for a Single Event</p>
<p>Championship Battle Imminent</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th) Various ball game competitions have reached the midpoint of the semifinals, with national elites gathering to make their final efforts. Shanghai fans regret the lack of opportunity to feast their eyes on the exciting and intense competition. This reporter will describe the situation in each category as follows, so that those unable to witness the battles in person can at least satisfy their curiosity.</p>
<h3 id="e262">(1) Soccer <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>The four giants of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Hebei will meet in the semifinals on the 17th. Hebei vs. Guangdong will start at 2 PM, and Shanghai vs. Hong Kong will start at 4 PM, both moved to the track and field stadium. Intense battles are expected. Based on strength, Shanghai has a better chance in the Shanghai vs. Hong Kong match. The Mo team, which is the Tianjin Zhonghua team, has Sun Enjing and others and is quite strong, capable of battling Guangdong. The situation is sure to be tense, but Guangdong is more likely to win.</p>
<h3 id="e263">(2) Men's Tennis <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Tennis experts are on the right side, while the left side is full of mediocrities. The semifinals on the 16th, Shanghai's Wang Wenzheng vs. Guangdong's Xu Huipei, Ping Gao Huimin vs. Ba Xu Chengji, and Shanghai's Yu Tianguang vs. Guangdong's Li Guangjun, are all remarkable matches. The semifinals on the 17th, Shanghai vs. Ba Cheng, are extremely interesting. Xu Chengji vs. Qiu Feihai is sure to be a sensation. According to Lin Baohua, Qiu can win three sets to one. However, Xu and Gao Huimin's match lacked exciting performances, but Xu has good serving and net play, which Qiu lacks. Xu is also known for serving and net play, while Qiu is the opposite. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who will win the Qiu vs. Xu match. Overall, regardless of whether Qiu wins or loses, Wang Wenzheng can confidently beat Lin Xuyin, and since Ba has no players for doubles, they can only forfeit according to the association's rules. Therefore, Shanghai will undoubtedly win.</p>
<h3 id="e264">(3) Men's Basketball <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Basketball is progressing rapidly everywhere. In addition to Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Guangdong, and the Philippine overseas Chinese, Nanjing's rise cannot be underestimated. Other regions are also very strong, making the future promising. It is a pity that the Philippine team came from afar only to be eliminated after two matches. In the future, the semifinalists are Shanghai vs. Guangdong and Hunan vs. Beijing. Shanghai and Guangdong are both less impressive than Hebei and Beijing, making it unfortunate that Hebei and Beijing will fight each other first. Hebei has Tang Baokun, Shen Bingyu, Yu Jingsun, and others, who are nationally renowned. The Beijing team, including Xian Yuanhuai, Wei Haiqing, and Jiang Shixuan, are also extremely elite. The battle between these two powerhouses is difficult to predict. In the Shanghai vs. Guangdong match, Shanghai is good at outsmarting, while Guangdong relies on Xiong's fierce line. Shanghai has a better chance of winning.</p>
<h3 id="e265">(4) Men's Volleyball <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The semifinalists in volleyball are Guangdong vs. Zhejiang and Hong Kong vs. Shanghai. Although Zhejiang is a latecomer, it is no match for Guangdong. Guangdong's Qiu Guangxie and Lu Kangyuan desperately merged with the Shanghai team, but their strength remains undiminished, making them extremely formidable. Hong Kong is no match for Shanghai. Shanghai's victory over Peiping was easy, indicating that the Shanghai team's strength is not to be underestimated and can be considered Guangdong's greatest enemy. Volleyball in our country is strongest in the South, but this time the Shanghai team has the potential to steal the show.</p>

<p>Baseball involves the five teams of Peiping, Hebei, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Hunan. Hunan is not worth mentioning, and Shanghai is outdated. Although there are many newcomers this time, and the Liang brothers' overseas fame is being used, there is no real achievement. They were eliminated by the Hebei team. Hong Kong has already defeated Peiping, and the two teams competing for the championship are Hebei and Hong Kong. Hong Kong has the longest history and won the Hong Kong Open Championship this year, demonstrating considerable skill. Although Hebei is a latecomer, it cannot be ignored, but Hong Kong is likely to win the championship.</p>

<p>In women's basketball, Shanghai and Fujian have the highest hopes of winning the championship. Unfortunately, in the second round, Shanghai narrowly escaped with a one-point victory, which can be considered extremely lucky. Objectively speaking, Fujian's skills are indeed above Shanghai's. Now that Shanghai has overcome this difficult hurdle, the future is quite promising. Peiping and Guangdong are also strong, and Guangdong can be expected to win in the semifinals. Hebei is not worth mentioning, and Shanghai can confidently win. The Shanghai vs. Guangdong final will surely be an intense battle, with Shanghai having a slightly better chance, but they must proceed cautiously and not act rashly. The skill of each team is very satisfying, and the popularity of men's and women's basketball is very gratifying.</p>

<p>The strength of each volleyball team is similar. The progress of women's sports is truly like a rapid rise. The Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong teams stand out from the crowd and are all extraordinary, similar to the situation in men's volleyball. Once the finals arrive, they are bound to cause a sensation on the volleyball court. The semifinals, Shanghai vs. Guangdong and Hong Kong vs. Peiping, will be held on the 18th. Hong Kong is sure to win, while the Shanghai vs. Guangdong clash is worrying.</p>

<p>There are no outstanding talents in tennis in various regions. The Wang sisters of Shanxi, Chunqing and Puwei, have skillful techniques and great promise. Huang Shuyi and Gao Yueying of Peiping are also very experienced. The Shanghai team is average. Shanxi's victory over Guangdong is evident. The Wang sisters are a formidable force. The Shanghai vs. Sichuan and Shanxi vs. Peiping matches are evenly matched. It is impossible to predict who will win. Let's see the results of the semifinals first and then decide.</p>

<p>The Shanghai softball team has a short history and is far inferior to Hebei, Peiping, and Guangdong. However, its progress has been surprisingly rapid. It defeated Henan in the first match and then defeated Peiping, successfully securing a spot in the finals. The match against Peiping, the North China champion, was expected to be a loss, mainly because the Peiping team's uniforms, tight-legged jodhpurs, were the same as the men's, indicating a strong team. However, the Shanghai team managed to win 13-8, which was truly surprising. The opponent in the finals will be the winner between Guangdong and Beijing. Beijing wins with a solid formation, while Guangdong wins with fierce hitting. Relatively speaking, Guangdong is likely to win. The Shanghai vs. Guangdong final will be very interesting to watch. Whether the Shanghai team can win depends entirely on the fielding skills of the outfielders.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 16th) Head Referee Wang Zhengting stated that the controversies caused by this conference will be handled impartially in order to set an example of sportsmanship and avoid creating bad precedents in the future. Therefore, even if there are inquiries or suggestions from the outside, they will still be handled according to this principle. Currently, the two disputes have been completely resolved and are no longer a problem. Regarding the location of the Chinese Sports Association, some people previously suggested moving it to the Central Sports Stadium, but for the convenience of dealing with the East Asian Games, it is still better to stay in Shanghai. Moreover, it is also more convenient for the association, which is a public organization, to raise funds in Shanghai. It has now been decided not to move.</p>

<p>(Central Telegram from Nanjing, 16th) The All-China Games Referee Committee held its second meeting on the afternoon of the 16th, chaired by Zhang Boling, to discuss the following matters: (1) Regarding the Jiangsu team's proposal to hold another performance of the 10,000-meter race to clarify the results, it was resolved that the conference would seek the consent of the first to fourth-place athletes. If consent is obtained, the performance will be held at 2 PM on the 19th. (2) Regarding the dispute between the Liaoning and Shanghai soccer teams, it was resolved that according to the report of referee Zhou Jiaqi, some of the athletes participating in the competition from Liaoning were not registered, violating the competition rules and should be considered to have forfeited.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 15th) After the conclusion of the 10,000-meter dispute, the leader of the Jiangsu team again wrote to the two competition and referee committees on the 15th, stating, "I have received your letter and fully understand the situation. Unfortunately, an error occurred in this 10,000-meter final. The responsibility for the error is a matter of public opinion. In order to consider the overall situation, our unit will abide by all orders of the conference. However, this matter is not only related to the referee's technical skills and experience but also involves the referee's ethics. The timekeeper's recorded result was indeed Jin Zhongkang's. If Kang's first-place decision is now overturned, then there will be no record for the 10,000-meter race, which is a great regret for the conference. In order to seek the truth, we respectfully request the conference to announce a date to summon Jin Zhongkang, Gu Desheng, Wang Zhenglin, and five others to hold another race as a performance. It is also possible to use this to determine an official record. We will abide by the conference's decision and have no objections. This letter is respectfully submitted, and we respectfully request your approval."</p>

<h3 id="e283">The Aim of Reviving the Nation Through Sports, by Cheng Dengke <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>Judging from the results of the National Sports Conference held last August 15th and the National Games that opened on October 10th this year, Chinese sports have indeed made considerable progress due to the government's enthusiastic promotion and the efforts of comrades. The path for Chinese sports in the future has been clearly indicated, and clear signposts have been erected for the past confusions. As for the various points discussed, they are profound in theory, perfect in organization, and thorough in consideration. I, Dengke, dare not comment on them. However, since returning to the country, I have always hoped to gather sports comrades from all over the country to continue to work hard and cooperate, hoping to implement them item by item as soon as possible, so that Chinese sports can be put on the right track and avoid the malpractice of making decisions without implementing them, giving people a handle and hindering the progress of sports. Fortunately, the ruling officials and education authorities have repeatedly and strongly ordered the implementation since the decision, but the results are only about 90%. Natural, economic, political, and human resources are all related, but the unity of spirit, the degree of effort, and all implementation methods, advancement steps, and the objects receiving sports are all greatly influenced by the sports comrades themselves. Because Chinese sports in the last two or three decades have focused on schools, the goals have been narrow, there is no overall organization, no perfect system, and a few sports comrades hold their own views and are unwilling to sacrifice and work together. Therefore, for decades, they have been unable to escape the abnormal development and mutual slander. In today's situation of foreign troubles and being bullied, the purpose of Chinese sports should be to expand the objects receiving sports training, and it should also be popularized to the whole people in order to (revive the nation) and (eliminate the criticism of the sick man of East Asia). Select the easiest to popularize and practical sports such as swimming, weightlifting, hiking, gymnastics, national arts, etc., and promptly promote them, detailing the rules and regulations, so that sports can be sports-oriented, nationalized, group-oriented, and militarized in the future, aiming to cultivate (healthy citizens who are united in resisting enemies and defending against insults). As for sports itself, avoid aristocracy and Westernization, and hope to integrate national arts and military affairs to create the newest, most practical, and national-reviving (Chinese sports system). The realization of this depends entirely on the enthusiasm of the ruling officials and the efforts of comrades who take (reviving the nation and avenging national shame) as the purpose of sports.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the world's understanding of sports has become particularly clear, and at the same time, its purpose has changed greatly. The organization and management are mostly military and political figures or commissioners, and the teaching materials and methods are mostly aimed at stirring up national struggle. However, the actual purpose, in addition to strengthening the physical and mental health of young people and the masses, there is a great, unfathomable, and unannounced purpose: to integrate soldiers into sports). I ask, as we are on the eve of the Second World War, and with greedy neighbors and the insatiable aggression of imperialism, can the narrow sports goals we had in the past adapt to the current environment and national conditions, and are they in line with the world's trends? I think the ruling officials, education authorities, and sports comrades have already understood this. In order to consolidate the foundation of sports in the future, to enhance national strength, to revive the nation, and to conform to the world's trends, Chinese sports must be under the same leadership and combine the spirit of unity, loyal efforts, and the sports comrades who do more and talk less, and implement (Ten Sports Goals). I am not talented, but I would like to present my views on the Ten Sports Goals to the people of the country during this conference, hoping to draw out better ideas, and I especially hope that the ruling officials, education authorities, and sports comrades will not be polite and correct them, so that the future of our country's sports will be bright, and I will be greatly benefited. The Ten Sports Goals are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Education-oriented: Train personality (2) Revolution-oriented: Revive the nation</p>
<p>(3) Military-oriented: Avenge national shame</p>
<p>(4) Chinese-oriented: Promote national arts</p>
<p>(5) Discipline-oriented: Abide by laws and obey orders</p>
<p>(6) Mass-oriented: Popularize throughout the country</p>
<p>(7) Health-oriented: Strive for health and beauty</p>
<p>(8) Hygiene-oriented: Eliminate addictions</p>
<p>(9) Art-oriented: Cultivate the body and mind</p>
<p>(10) World-oriented: All nations come to pay tribute</p>
<p>The above ten sports goals are the path to revive the Chinese nation. I am serving the conference and have no time to explain them item by item in detail. Please forgive me. If you have any instructions, please send them to the Central University Gymnasium.</p>

The female athletes' performance of "Silang Visits His Mother" was especially praised by the audience. The reporter happened to be at the conference and asked Zhao about his thoughts on the 10,000-meter controversy. Zhao said that your newspaper's report advocates fairness, and what I wanted to say has already been said by your newspaper. If the conference wants to re-run the 10,000 meters, I am also willing. Now that it has been decided to have a performance with the Jiangsu team, then of course, I am happy, and so on. Gu Desheng was also present at the time, dressed in black student attire and remained silent. The reporter first expressed sympathy to Gu for performing the 10,000-meter race, but Gu said that he did not know what the general team leader's opinion was.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 16th) The telegrams sent by various newspapers and the public during this National Games were much faster than usual. This is due to two reasons: first, direct express lines; second, no censorship. This can be considered progress in transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Qiu Feihai Should Strive; Listen to the Guidance of the Shanghai Municipality <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th) Of the nine men's championships in the National Games, apart from basketball, where Nanjing and Hebei have some hope, the remaining eight championships are the exclusive property of the three regions of Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong. The overall championship is bound to be contested by these three regions. Shanghai relies on the efforts of track and field athletes and has already won the track and field and all-around championships. If it can win any one more ball game championship, it can win the overall championship of the Games. However, among ball games, only tennis is relatively certain; other ball games are evenly matched with Guangdong and Hong Kong, with no certainty.</p>
<p>As for tennis, against Guangdong, according to the lineup planned by coach Zhang Zizhen and team leader Shen Siliang, Qiu Feihai was supposed to be the first singles player, Wang Wenzheng the second singles player, and Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang the doubles team. Unexpectedly, Qiu refused to play singles in order to prepare for the semi-final match with Xu Chengji, a renowned young player from Batavia (Jakarta), on the 17th. Wang Wenzheng was changed to the first singles player, and Yu Tianguang or Zheng Zhaojia to the second singles player. Wang's match with Xu Huipei was a difficult one, and Wang barely won. Generally, Shanghai can hope to eliminate Guangdong. However, if Wang loses to Guangdong's Xu in the semi-final on the 17th, thus losing the qualification for the final, then not only will the tennis championship be hopeless, but the overall championship will also be uncertain. The gain or loss of championships is secondary, but Qiu Feihai's disregard for the overall situation, ignoring the advice of the coach and team leader, focusing solely on the victory or defeat against Xu Chengji, seems inappropriate. Tennis coach Zhang Zizhen expressed deep dissatisfaction with Qiu's attitude.</p>

First, a large pile of wood was doused with kerosene and set on fire, then sprayed with chemical foam, which immediately extinguished the fire. The audience was particularly large because it was during a break in the various events.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to all levels of schools in the city, stating:</p>
<p>"According to the instruction No. 9857 of the Ministry of Education, it was previously reported by the Guangdong Provincial Education Department and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau for clarification on the criminal penalties for students forging diplomas or graduation certificates. The Judicial Yuan was consulted and a unified interpretation of laws meeting was held and a reply was sent to inform. Recently, in the reports of new students submitted by various schools, inquiries from various agencies regarding students' graduation qualifications, and applications for study abroad certificates, there have been instances of forging certificates in an attempt to deceive. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated: in addition to expelling students who forge certificates while still in school, those who forge official seals, whether or not they have graduated, should be reported immediately upon discovery or sent by the competent educational administrative agency to the court for investigation and prosecution according to law. In addition to distributing this to the lower levels, the bureau is ordered to comply and instruct all public and registered private schools at all levels to comply."</p>

<p>Cheng Shihui, Director of the Jiangxi Department of Education, considers the literacy movement to be one of the seven movements stipulated by the central government. In the province, at the time of cooperation in bandit suppression, silent transformation makes this literacy work even more important. In order to set an example for each county, it will start with the provincial capital. A draft plan for popularizing literacy education in the provincial capital has been prepared and submitted to the educational administrative conference held by the department last month for discussion, and it has been approved by the conference. Now that the case has been decided, it should be implemented as soon as possible to avoid the problem of discussion without action. Therefore, the resolution was immediately submitted for discussion at the staff meeting in order to implement it on schedule, and a literacy movement item was set to be held before implementation to spread propaganda. The total budget for this is more than 10,000 yuan, and the number of people educated can reach more than 125,000. The cost per person is only for public use.</p>

<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>In China's old-fashioned society, everyone knows that the noblest occupations are reading and farming. Nothing is more carefree. With "First Farming, Second Reading," no one is more noble than a reader, and no one is more sacred than a farmer.</p>
<p>"Every trade has its master" (三十六行行行出狀元). Practical people say that every occupation has its own joy, but the most miserable are the unemployed vagrants. They have nothing to do all day long, and their bread and butter is unsettled. They fundamentally do not worship the "First Farming, Second Reading" doctrine. Occupations, for them, are just to earn a living. As long as they can achieve "First Farming, Second Reading," they absolutely don't care.</p>
<p>"When the tide ebbs to its lowest, it will turn back." (水行倒盡頭，會得倒回來。) Since the reform of the national system, the concept of class has been broken, but the wheel of the restoration movement is turning back before our eyes. Even with "strict examinations" and "rural revitalization," after all, our thousands of years of worship of farming and reading is still being taught and valued by people.</p>
<p>In modern society, in an atmosphere of economic recession, farming and reading themselves have become damaged and withered. We express our deepest condolences and cannot even talk about worship. Floods, droughts, and cheap grain hurt farmers. Farmers not only implement austerity policies but also brace their bodies to work in the fields. Scholars are particularly struggling. Thousands and hundreds of dollars are spent, and they eagerly await promotion and graduation. In the end, they may graduate, but there is still no way out.</p>
<p>In this situation where the two major issues of farming and reading in the country have reached the end of their rope, although "strict examinations" and "rural revitalization" are a way to provide relief on the one hand and strictly select talents on the other, from the perspective of those who are engaged in farming and reading, their own hard work and effort is far less comfortable than the life of a ticket seller in a movie theater or a dancer in a dance hall in a large city. Therefore, people's faith in "First Farming, Second Reading" is like engaging in speculative business, with the concepts of luck and failure forever battling in their hearts without being resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e308">Thoughts on the Headmasters' Social Gathering <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Guanguan</p>
<p>"Ten yellow dogs, nine males; ten teachers, nine poor." Comrades who are engaged in education were destined for life by a certain celebrity eight or nine years ago, so until now, everyone knows in their hearts that they are all facing economic panic. (Recession), in modern society, although it is a common phenomenon, it is especially true for education. Long gowns must be worn, teachers' dignity must be maintained, the lowest desires, and all expenses—which one can be avoided, which one can be saved! Alas! It is pitiful to say, being busy all day long, only to be able to fill their stomachs. In this environment, not to mention not having spare money to spend on entertainment, they don't even have any free time! However, the facts often go beyond the ideals of ordinary people. In Shanghai, where all industries are experiencing panic, a headmasters' social gathering organization has recently been formed. Everyone contributes one dollar and holds a meeting once a month, and nearly two hundred schools have joined the membership. This unexpected situation clearly shows that comrades who are living a hard life have had a new awakening. They have realized that in order to improve the status quo and find a way out of hardship, it is necessary to unite together and discuss with each other.</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, at the entrance of the YMCA, there was a piece of paper labeled "Headmasters' Social Gathering of Primary and Secondary Schools." I walked upstairs, signed my name, paid the fee, and entered the door. I saw the auditorium was filled with headmasters who were serious and dignified. Everyone was sitting quietly, listening attentively; looking back at the stage, it turned out that the top boss, Director Pan, was giving a speech. As the saying goes, "Don't be afraid of officials, be afraid of those in charge." Now, the school headmasters were naturally sitting upright and solemnly, becoming exemplary listeners to the education bureau director's speech.</p>
<p>That was the second gathering. There was food, wine, and educational films to watch. The headmasters were all smiling and happy, and the excitement was not shallow. However, what I think is insufficient is that the dignified headmasters, in a crowded gathering, are still casual and lack the true spirit of unity full of vigor. For example, when it comes to electing staff, the votes are scattered very much. At that time, except for Mr. Ma Yixian, the rest all had one or two votes. If there were more than ten votes, they could be elected. Of course, Mr. Feng is a sincere friend and is trusted by everyone, but there are also not a few others who are enthusiastic and well-known, but they all like to elect their own, fully demonstrating the attitude of French politicians!</p>
<p>Stealing half a day of leisure and spending one dollar is not an easy thing for us who are destined to be poor, so I still hope that we can use this opportunity to carry out true unity and find a bright path in this dark society.</p>

<p>Horse racing. The racecourse earns at least 50,000 yuan in commission each time.</p>
<p>There are 500,000 unemployed people in society, with Shanghai alone having 500,000. It wouldn't matter if 100,000 could have enough to eat, but 400,000 are living on empty stomachs.</p>
<p>According to a field survey, there are more women than men in China.</p>
<p>There are 100 million yuan worth of gold in China. 900 million is in the United States, 50 million is in Japan, and the remaining 50 million is circulating in China.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen</p>
<p>Who Can Be Without Feeling When Family is Missed? High Morale! Soldiers Despise Deceit! A Bold Declaration Boosts Army Morale!</p>
<p>Generally, a soldier, no matter how stubborn his personality, is always full of obedience. This isn't because the three words "obedience" and the two words "soldier" have some kind of innate connection. However, the first important thing emphasized in the military camp is obedience. The better the army is trained, the greater the obedience of the people in the army. The officers commanding the soldiers, from the commander-in-chief to the squad leader, are all conscientious, fearing that the people below them will lose their obedience. Because it is human nature to be greedy for life and afraid of death, to train thousands upon thousands of people to listen to an order and regard death as returning home, how can this be achieved without training obedience? Therefore, those who are very used to being soldiers unconsciously develop a kind of obedience. At this time, Zhao Ziqiang quietly passed through the wilderness, truly with myriad feelings in his heart. Suddenly hearing a military bugle call, he abruptly stopped his steps, thinking, "I can't leave." Judging from the situation of this departure, something is different. Maybe an order will be issued at any time. Although I stipulated that I would return to the camp in two hours, what if something happened within two hours? In my company, two platoon leaders have left, and one company commander has also left. Are all the affairs of the company to be handed over to one platoon leader? What if this platoon leader also leaves? While he was thinking this, he returned to Haitian in a daze. After some consideration, he felt that this matter was too insecure. The more he thought about it, the more afraid he became, so he simply walked back to the camp. As he was about to reach the company headquarters, he met Tian Qing. He frowned tightly, his face red, and walked closer. Zhao Ziqiang smiled at him from afar, and before he could open his mouth, he smiled and spoke first. Nodding, he said, "Old Zhao, are you coming from Haitian? This matter is really unfortunate!" Saying that, he grasped Zhao Ziqiang's hand and patted him on the shoulder, and then laughed, "We are in the same boat." To put it elegantly, it's "heroes are short of breath, and affections for their children are long." (214)</p>

<p>If your hair has lost its original beauty, if your hair is sparse, dry, weak, dull, and lifeless, then without a doubt, the cause of this and the difficulty lie entirely in scalp grime. With scalp grime, the hair and hair roots become a state of lacking nutrition. There are naturally many reasons for scalp grime, among which the most common and important is a lack of proper brushing. Hair is like the body, equally in need of exercise. The exercise of the hair is scalp stimulation. This kind of appropriate exercise is very suitable and very necessary for healthy hair. The best way to stimulate the scalp is to vigorously and thoroughly brush the hair twice, morning and evening, and there is no other better method.

If you have this kind of hair tonic to wash your hair, plus vigorous and thorough brushing morning and evening, the original beauty of your hair will surely be easily restored, and other difficulties, such as sparseness, dryness, weakness, dullness, lifelessness, etc., can be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e312">Perfume Selection <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>Which kind of perfume should we use? This question is worth discussing. We always choose powders that are suitable for our skin and buy them every day. When we go to get our hair cut, we must choose a style that we like and tell the barber to cut it. When we go to buy a pair of leather shoes, we always choose a style that is beautiful and a size that fits. So, choosing perfume should also be like this, and it must suit our personality, so that when we use this perfume, it can represent a part of our beauty. Whether it has seductive appeal is not something we need to consider. Many women are very fond of perfumes with a strong and sweet fragrance as household perfumes; such as lily of the valley, violet, lilac, sunflower, rose, and so on. The above-mentioned types of perfume are just a general overview. There are certainly more types of perfume sold on the market, and we may want to choose one that suits our personality as a frequently used perfume. A person who is meticulous about beauty and skilled at grooming, if able to skillfully apply perfume, perfume will be the only pleasant supplement. Do not spray too much, and do not spray so much that it is too noticeable. That is the most important secret to applying perfume. If you have chosen a perfume that suits your own personality, then the toilet soap, fragrant powder, moisturizer, etc. that you buy should preferably be the same fragrance as the perfume. In today's era where everything is meticulous and modern, there are countless beauty products and decorative supplements. It must be very easy to choose beauty products of the same price, quality, and fragrance.</p>
<h3 id="e313">Leather Shoe Repair <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Handling leather shoes by wrongly using methods for handling clothes can result in leather shoes that should last a year becoming worn out in just half a year. Therefore, the handling of leather shoes should not be taken lightly, and the methods applied should be carefully considered. When choosing leather shoes, you must pay attention again and again to the correct and suitable size. If the leather shoes are too small, they will be subjected to excessive and improper stretching when putting them on and taking them off, and they will soon break. If the leather shoes are too big, they will easily wrinkle and become old after wearing them for a short time. Not too big, not too small, comfortable to wear, is the right fit, and they can be used for a longer time. If leather shoes get damp or wet and are placed on a fire to dry, that is the most wrong and foolish thing to do. You must know that the heat of the fire is enough to cause the leather to crack. The best way to remove moisture is to use gauze to make two small bags, fill the bags with bran, wheat bran, or oats, and stuff them into the leather shoes, one bag per shoe. After about an hour, you can find that the moisture on the leather shoes has been absorbed by the contents of the small bags. After the leather shoes are dry, take out the bags. Black leather shoes made of wild lambskin can be restored to their original state if you quickly remedy them when they first show wrinkles and become old. The way to remedy them is to mix one part of olive oil (Sweet oil) with two parts of black ink, use a sponge to absorb this mixture, apply it to the leather shoes, and after a few hours, wipe them in the usual way. After wiping, the leather shoes will be brand new. To make black leather shoes bright and shiny, just add a little milk to the shoe polish and wipe them together. Not only will it make the black leather bright and colorful, but it will also make the leather less prone to cracking, and it can also make the black color last longer. If there are stains on the leather shoes, when removing them, you should first remove them from the outer circle of the stain, and then wipe towards the center in a circular motion; otherwise, a white stain ring will inevitably remain on the leather shoes forever, which is very unsightly.</p>

The wool market opened flat and brought fatigue, with European and Far Eastern winds and clouds being urgent. After opening, supply exceeded demand, and a Reuters dispatch brought news that the US had not yet raised prices to a satisfactory level, and so it was still difficult to agree to stabilize the gold standard. Major firms were aggressively selling off their holdings, and banks were still buying cheaply, gradually rebounding. The forward market was even better. In general, the psychological outlook for Germany was that even if war broke out, the price of gold might rise, as the American gold in Germany would inevitably be transported back, and the exchange rate might see a contraction.

<p>There is a Sense of Being Surrounded by Selling Firms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange, because Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and military contraction, people's hearts were already shaken, coupled with the sharp reduction in tariff revenue, people's morale felt even more sluggish. Major firms in the market had quite a few sales, and the situation felt quite discouraged. Bullish positions also had quite a few exits. At the same time, although there were many advancing firms, their buying volume was poor, so the market price did not show any signs of recovery throughout the day. The market opened in the morning, slightly tired by one or two jiao, but still feeling flat. After the thirty-third and fifty-fourth numbers traded, there were sales, and although the forty-seventh number had a slight advance, it took advantage of the situation to raise prices, so it continued to fall by two or three jiao. The market opened in the afternoon, still surrounded by sales from the thirty-third and fifty-fourth numbers, and although the eleventh and sixteenth numbers had buying, supply still exceeded demand, and the market was still tired and unable to recover. Each session was down by two or three jiao or four or five jiao. Judging by the trend, from morning to evening, because selling firms were surging, there was no stop, but the unified salt tax at the close seemed relatively stable. In the future, once the selling firms stop, there will be a resurgence, because there are ultimately no major changes in the environment. The result of the full day's market price was that it fell by four or five jiao to over one yuan, the total number of transactions being 10,016,000 yuan, including 5,000 yuan in spot goods, and 4,290,000 yuan in unified salt tax futures, 970,000 yuan in military downsizing, 1,405,000 yuan in 1929 Customs Tariff, 1,770,000 yuan in 2022, 950,000 yuan in Zhengzheng 696, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to 350,000.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on the 15th, the New York stock market, when opening, sold off in competition due to a general belief that the government would implement a firm monetary policy, and the market fell. When closing, short-sellers entered, and it rebounded again. Germany's withdrawal and military contraction had little impact on the market, but public sales of various items fell sharply, especially in Germany and France in the morning. American public bonds were still stable. Since the stock market lacks pressure and has a more stable potential trend, it may be promising soon, and it is quite suitable to maintain a position to await the recovery of the market. The number of full-day transactions was 802,500 shares (wheat). A serious bull market settlement, the market fell sharply, but attracted a large number of new buyers, and factories bought a lot due to brisk flour sales, so after the bull market settlement, the market rose again, and it is quite profitable to buy (cotton). The excitement of speculation caused by thorough inflation has now vanished, but the sluggish market may have a healthier consideration. Domestic sales in September decreased by 90,000 bales, causing the market to fall, but the market seems to have more short positions, and there may be a reaction (silver). The market closed relatively stable due to speculative buying and short covering. The price of gold at the US Treasury Department was 29.83 yuan per two. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation is relatively stable, with a certain bull absorbing a firm amount and not letting it go. At the same time, a certain cotton industry organization was established, and it is generally said that there are maintenance measures for cotton yarn, so speculators are all holding their hands and watching. Therefore, transactions have decreased, but in reality it is extremely flat. Various gangs are in extremely difficult economic circumstances, so there are very few new bulls, but the buying pull is very strong, and there is a lack of certainty about the future.</p>

<p>The cotton market is extremely bleak. Overseas cotton markets have mixed gains and losses, resulting in flat morale. However, with the approaching delivery deadline for October, according to a portion of the cotton inspection office's verified goods, there is not yet a sufficient amount of chips, so the bulls are tightening and not letting go, and the market is firm and rising as a result. However, a certain factory is throwing out tens of thousands of loads to be delivered, and in terms of the overall situation, it does not escape a volatile situation.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Nearly 70 sources, mostly new goods. As a result, the market situation for new goods suddenly turned unfavorable. The initial market was still flat, but then prices fell all the way down, like a landslide, unstoppable. This was because the arrival of goods from other places suddenly increased, and people's hearts were disheartened, causing the shopkeepers' interests to become stagnant, and the brokers were still very strict. Because of this, sellers had no way to recover, and the market prices of new rice from various provinces and "Bai Ge" rice in kilns immediately fell by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. Newly pointed rice was reduced by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and new "Yin Yuan" rice also fell by 0.2 yuan. As for broken rice, it was greatly affected and fell by more than one foot.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) More than 30 sources from various roads in Hexia, the market sales were sluggish, and the market price of high-quality broken rice was slightly down a few cents. The price of medium-quality broken rice, western new rice, new Du pointed rice, and Bai Guo rice fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The price of new Yang pointed rice, Bu pointed rice, Bai Yuan kiln rice, and other varieties fell slightly by more than one jiao. Old thin rice was tight by a few cents, and passenger pointed rice was also down by a little over one jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e328">Flour and Wheat Fall to Unsustainable Levels: Flour Down 7.5 Cents, Wheat Down 1.3 Jiao <a href="#e328" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c328" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">328</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month saw an unprecedented sharp decline. As for the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by 1.23 yuan, and Canada fell by about 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. The quoted price of dated futures has already fallen, and the quoted price of spot goods has also been greatly reduced. It was heard that some factories had made transactions of foreign wheat before the end of last week, but the price has always been kept secret. Therefore, after the opening price, the fall was even more serious, and the entire market was in a storm.</p>
<p>A few followed out, and most of the bulls could not avoid being slaughtered. For a time, the selling atmosphere was full, and it seemed possible that flour would be worthless. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the situation was even more serious, and both near-term and distant futures were moving step by step towards the selling side. Because at that time, it was also reported that the quoted price of spot foreign wheat had been lowered to 4.2 yuan, so the major factories sold off their prices again. This month has fallen again and again, and there is even a feeling that it will fall to the 2 yuan mark. Seeing that the trend of foreign wheat is like this, and there is also a feeling of oversupply in the country, I am afraid that the rear step has not yet reached a safe situation. As a result, this month fell sharply by 6.5 cents compared to the closing price at the end of last week, November fell 7.5 cents, December fell 6.75 cents, January fell 6 cents, and February and March fell 4.5 cents.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market prices in each month saw a consistent sharp decline. As for the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell by 1.23 yuan, and Canada fell by about 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, people's hearts have been depressed, but the chip side of the selling households is still not very small, so although the situation is not good, the decline is only 0.3 to 0.5 points. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, due to the madness of the decline in the flour market, and because of the step-by-step slackening of spot foreign wheat, people inside and outside the industry were extremely frightened. For a time, the treasure gas was also unusually smooth, and the stormy waves were not enough to simulate the tragic scene at that time. As a result, this month fell by 1.2 jiao, November fell by 1.3 jiao, December and January each fell by 1 jiao, and March fell by 0.7 jiao. Due to the sharp drop in the standard flour and wheat, both factory and customer parties stopped and did not ask.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the appetite for passenger indica rice was not strong, and the street was also watching. By noon, the passenger merchants all started to do business smoothly, and continued to do business smoothly in the afternoon. The market was lively, high-quality goods were very clear, and medium-quality goods also stood firm. If the passenger merchants are greedy for the market again today and tomorrow, it is necessary to step-build. Although the arrival of goods has been checked recently, but because the price of origin is high, they are unwilling to sell cheaply. Moreover, the appetite of Quanzhou is becoming stronger and stronger. Fuzhou and Guangzhou also have business. There are also Xinghua merchants who come to the market to inquire. After stopping for several days, the street resumed buying yesterday. The city of Xinghua sold 141 bags of Hunan machine-milled Jing, and the street sold 100 bags of Hunan rough rice and 300 bags of Beijing rough rice. Quanzhou merchants sold 4,200 bags of Nanjing factory indica rice, and Fuzhou merchants sold 100 bags of Anqing machine-milled rice. In addition, they cooperated with Guangdong merchants to sell 1,300 bags of Nanjing machine-milled indica rice. The market is similar to last week, but the passenger merchants are lively, and the future is looking good. Yesterday, the Fuzhou band's transaction could have been more prosperous, but one of the bands was affected by the bandit disaster in the township and went bankrupt, so it is inevitable that the transaction was also affected. It is also rumored in the market that a new batch of foreign rice has arrived in port, about 2,500 tons, but foreign merchants deny it, or suspect that it is transferred from Guangdong province after taxation.</p>

<p>The market situation of new raw peanuts is extremely pessimistic due to the weakness of the supporting flowers. The market plate of 20 to 30 bags is still calm, and a few more bags will be cut. Yesterday, a total of 270 bags of Shandong goods arrived in the market.

The arrival of goods in each stall is insufficient for supply and demand, so the market situation in the future is expected to continue to rise.</p>

Shanghai Baichangjing A-grade Jin Shuanglu factory building map and other brands were estimated to be 840 yuan per bag in Chinese currency, and B-grade San Tiaowu and other brands were only 770 yuan (Lyon delivery), which was 30 to 40 yuan lower than last Thursday.

<h3 id="e338">Tokyo Observation (Roar) <a href="#e338" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c338" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">338</a></h3>
<p>—Record of Gao Ming</p>
<p>(Roar, China!) This drama is currently popular in Shanghai. As for me, I watched this drama one night four or five years ago in Tokyo (Hongo) Theater, Japan.</p>
<p>Two dramas were performed that night, one was Eiguchi Kan's (Opium War), and the other was (Roar, China!). The performers were the Local Troupe; at that time, this famous troupe was in the midst of internal division, so this night's performance was indeed worthy of the name (power performance).</p>
<p>There were many audiences, almost sold out. Because it was a new drama performed by a new troupe, many uniformed and plainclothes police officers came.</p>
<p>The curtain was rushed open by the audience's enthusiastic emotions, and (Opium War) began to be shown to us. This drama, later renamed (The First European Flag), has been translated into Chinese by a gentleman. The actors spoke too fast, perhaps they were working too hard, so that it was difficult for the average person to understand. The audience kept shouting... (Speak more clearly!) (Can't speak more clearly?) Until later, it finally calmed down. This gray and dull drama unfolded smoothly on the stage without characteristics, and closed without characteristics.</p>
<p>Rest.</p>
<p>The curtain opened for the first time. (Roar, China!) was staged. The audience regained their spirits and focused their attention on the stage. Foreign warships, docks…… As the drama progressed scene by scene on the stage, the audience's emotions gradually became lively. It seems that these audiences care! Or even sympathize! With China. When the drama on stage reached the point where imperialists oppressed or insulted Chinese workers, the police clapped their hands, and some of the audience responded with (Bastard!) Scolding. Indeed, even here, the struggle is being continued before us. When it came to the place where Chinese workers were shot on the dock, those bloodthirsty policemen clapped their hands again, and the audience again unhesitatingly responded with (Beast!) The emotional curse. And at this moment, I saw a middle-class Japanese girl sitting on my right lowering her head and covering her eyes with her hands. Oh, kind-hearted and respectable neighboring girl, have you noticed a Chinese teenager secretly wiping grateful tears in the darkness (when the lights were black)?</p>
<p>In short, on this night, in addition to watching the drama on the stage, I also saw a more real and meaningful drama off the stage. At the last (curtain call), a Japanese student sitting on my left talked to me, and I asked him what he thought of tonight's drama?, he said... (Compared to (Opium War), the China in (Roar, China!) is of course much more hopeful. What do you think? I said... (But even (Roar, China!) only shows the emerging China in the dawn period. The current China is standing on a more advanced stage. What do you think?</p>
<h3 id="e339">Tobacco and Opium <a href="#e339" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c339" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">339</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>We already know when and where opium was imported into China, and when its toxicity began to prevail. However, we also want to know whether tobacco is native to China or imported from other countries, and when it became a national hobby.</p>
<p>According to historical records, tobacco and opium originally had a combined relationship. When the Manchu Qing government first prohibited the smoking and sale of opium, it was in the seventh year of Yongzheng. After the ban was issued, Liu Shiming, the governor of Fujian,奏称; Li Guozhi, the prefect of Zhangzhou, caught Chen Yuan, a trader who privately sold 34 jin of opium, and had already sentenced him to military crime. And when I submitted the proposal for personal interrogation, Chen Yuan confessed that opium was originally a medicinal material, and it was not the same thing as the harmful opium smoke. When the pharmacist was called to recognize the trial, they all said that this was a medicinal material, a necessary product for the treatment of dysentery, and it could not harm people. However, if it is added to tobacco and boiled together, it will become opium smoke. Li Guozhi falsely regards opium as opium smoke. It is wrong, and should be reported in accordance with the example of deliberately entering a person's crime. We are born in this time, and we can't help but laugh when we hear that opium and opium smoke are not the same thing. There may be this difference in the daytime. The so-called adding tobacco and boiling it together to become opium smoke is probably a fact.</p>
<p>Recently, I borrowed Guoxue Lunye from Mr. Juren, which contains an article by Mr. Zheng Zongqi (The Origin and Development of Opium), which is well researched. His description of the relationship between tobacco and opium is also very interesting. It is said that tobacco originated in the West Indies of the Americas, and was transmitted to the Philippine Islands by Spaniards. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, it was reintroduced to Fujian by the islands. As soon as this thing entered China, it suddenly became popular among men, women, old and young. It was strictly prohibited in the twelfth year of Chongzhen, but it did not stop. Not only the mainland of China, but also Manchuria at that time, the smoking style was also very popular. In the third year of Chongde (the eleventh year of Chongzhen), (the ban on exporting and buying tobacco) had been strictly promulgated. In the sixth year, the ban on smoking was even stricter, but the Manchus could not quit themselves. Coincidentally, James I of England once persuaded the public to quit smoking, but it failed, which was also during the late Ming Dynasty. In short, since the end of the Ming Dynasty, that is, at the beginning of the seventeenth century in the Western calendar, the smoking style has swept through China. In the late same century, Kaempfer, who traveled to Persia, the South Seas Islands, and Japan, said; The Persians, because of the toxic quality and unpleasant nature of tobacco, created the hookah smoking method. The Persians spread this method to the Arabs of Cende Stan, and the Cende people spread it to the indigenous people of the Indian Ocean and the South Seas Islands. From this, Batavia in Java also prevailed in the hookah smoking style. Searching for and slightly putting the tobacco slices in the water, so that they can be dissolved and smoked, then opened the evil habit of mixing opium and tobacco. However, in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, trade between Java and Taiwan was frequent, and this smoking habit gradually spread to Taiwan. At that time, it was before and after Zheng Chenggong occupied Taiwan, and many Chinese people traveled to and from Taiwan. The method of smoking opium water through bamboo pipes or metal pipes was mostly passed down from Java and Taiwan. Tracing its origin, it was actually created by the Persians.</p>
<h3 id="e340">Taking a Shortcut <a href="#e340" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c340" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">340</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The Chinese national character seems to especially like taking shortcuts. There is a wide road in front of him, but he is not willing to take it. He must explore whether there is another remote and quick path that can be copied to the destination earlier. If there is, then even if he climbs vines and clings to branches, climbs mountains and crosses ridges, he will not regret it.</p>
<p>In order to greed for these simple things, and willing to suffer enough physical pain, the Chinese people's spirit of being born into the world is very admirable.</p>
<p>This is also evidenced in history (since ancient times). In the struggle between military strategists, those who seize the power of victory are often those who can take a small road to the back of the enemy, and use thunder to cover their ears, so that the enemy is caught off guard, and they can kill a great defeat. Therefore, Chencang secretly crossed, and finally established the four-hundred-year foundation of the Han family; and Yinping stole the 縋, also built Deng Ai's special merit of destroying Shu. Alas! The merit of taking shortcuts, how can it not be great!</p>
<p>Today, there are more and more Chinese people taking shortcuts, and their skills are becoming more and more sophisticated, and they have simply reached the point where they are pure and pure. The book people are not willing to abide by their duties and get involved in writing. They must auction their personality and sharpen their scalps to drill a government job. Nothing else, just taking a shortcut. The businessman is not willing to abide by his duties and do business. He must buy and sell nothing. He must go to the gold exchange to make him a few hundred liang of gold. Nothing else, also taking a shortcut.</p>
<p>Although taking shortcuts has a great hope of success, this shortcut is very difficult to take. Just like climbing vines and clinging to branches, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, as long as you are not careful under your feet, you will immediately plant a public onion, and fall from a thousand-foot-high mountain into a ten-thousand-foot-deep abyss. The book people take shortcuts to run for government officials, and once the political situation changes, the trees fall and the apes and monkeys scatter, they will not be able to measure words, and the martial arts will not be able to serve as soldiers. The merchants take shortcuts to do standard gold, and once the United States abolishes the gold standard and the price of gold plummets, they will inevitably swallow opium and throw themselves into the Huangpu.</p>
<p>However, I often see people falling from the shortcut, but I often see people taking shortcuts. Moreover, the old shortcut takers have fallen, and there are more new shortcut takers. Alas! The Chinese people's spirit of taking shortcuts is admirable!</p>
<h3 id="e341">Self-Comfort <a href="#e341" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c341" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">341</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>Others are all there to be promoted and get rich, but you are poor and frustrated all your life. Naturally, you can't help but feel a little emotional in your heart. Of course, you are not indignant if you are indignant, and poverty seems to be your destined fate. So, some people really believe in determinism. Since fame and wealth are all determined in the previous life, there is no need to worry about one's own poverty, and there is no need to be envious of others' prestige. On the other hand, it can also show that others' status is superior to me, not because my skills are inferior to others. Because these are all predetermined by fate.</p>
<p>But, why am I just having this hard life? This seems a little disrespectful. However, smart people immediately came up with a way to say... It doesn't matter if you are poor, this is the only way to be noble! This is really a super-class appearance of the world being filthy, and only I am clean. That is also the second way for poor people to comfort themselves. I have been a village elementary school teacher for five years, and I am still engaged in this profession. I think that although this profession is not very despicable, it does not seem to be so noble, but whenever I talk about it in the same way, lamenting the hardship of this profession, people always say... Except for the two words of nobility, this profession really has no place to make people covet. I don't understand why teaching children to recognize a few words every day and taking a dozen or so yuan a month is particularly noble? Of course, you can covet nobility, but in fact you are still poor. When you want to borrow some money, you may not be able to afford it. So, some people quoted Mencius's words... When the heavens are about to bestow a great responsibility on a person, they must first work their muscles and bones, and starve their bodies... (I am ashamed that I have read the books of sages in vain. I don't know if this sentence is written wrongly? It seems that poverty is precisely the inevitable process of future happiness, looking forward to the future, leisurely and leisurely. Not only is it enough to comfort yourself, but you can also be proud!</p>
<p>This is the spiritual comfort method of poor people. Countless poor people grow up, enjoy, and die here.</p>
<p>In fact, determinists only show their despicable cowardice... Those who praise themselves as noble are also ridiculously pitiful. As for the third party, what is quoted is the words of the sages, and it does not seem to be unreasonable. But there are thousands of people who work all day and starve, so why did many slaves in the past end their lives under the whip? Only by understanding what great responsibility is about to be bestowed, and how to earnestly shoulder this great responsibility, can people have the hope of saving themselves from the predicament of poverty!</p>

<p>Among all the recent young novelists, Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng is one of my favorites, although he hasn't published many works and doesn't seem to have become famous yet. In this month's (Continental) magazine, his new work (Grandmother) is published again. This is a short story of only four thousand words, but it is a work of art. The theme is also very simple: A rural, not-so-wealthy family has a grandmother who is said to be almost one hundred years old. However, in the eyes of her daughter-in-law, her appetite is even greater than that of a strong man. So the daughter-in-law scolds the old woman, starves her directly. The grandmother cries, makes a fuss, and curses, but even when her son hears it, he thinks (an old person's crying is superfluous). The son and daughter-in-law go to work in the fields, leaving their granddaughter to watch the house, hiding all the edible things in places (where even ghosts can't find them) or (hanging them high on hooks). The grandmother begs the granddaughter, but the granddaughter won't tell her anything, which is the success of her parents' education. One day, the grandmother is so hungry that she wants to go to the county to sue her unfilial son and daughter-in-law, so she (walks at a snail's pace on the path in the pine forest outside the village), but on the way, someone tells her... (Now the world has changed, county officials don't care about this kind of thing, and people look down on old women ``````)</p>
<p>(Then, she immediately burst into loud cries, she cursed the world, and also cursed the county officials `````` She sat down by the side of the road... not going to the county, nor going home, she cried, cursed, ignored the people who tried to persuade her, ignored the thunder, ignored the heavy rain, she was still sitting by the side of the road ``````) Until the evening of the next day, the grandmother still hadn't moved, but was finally sent home and fell ill in bed. When the grandmother had already breathed her last, the son and daughter-in-law secretly walked to the outside of the grandmother's room to listen, but there was no sound. Then, they specially called the granddaughter to the grandmother's bedside to open the curtain and see).</p>
<p>According to (the stuttering report of the extremely frightened granddaughter)... (Grandmother is not dead, not dead! Those scary eyes ````````) At this time, the daughter-in-law was cutting vegetables in the kitchen, and the cleaver clanged down on the wooden stool. (I guessed right, she won't die for a while! She will live to be a hundred years old ````````)</p>
<p>That's how this novel ends. In it, I first saw exquisite art, like the art of Chekhov and Maupassant in making short stories. His concise writing style, his refined technique, the appropriateness of his characters' dialogues, and the truthfulness of his characters all seem to come from the hand of a great artist. Even in such a theme that is completely sympathetic to the grandmother, our author did not fall into sentimental or romantic sympathy. With very economical strokes, he fully shows the nagging and trouble of an old man. The daughter-in-law seems like a purely evil woman, but we don't feel that she is exaggerated. When the old woman next door advises her to serve her well because the grandmother is about to die, the author makes the daughter-in-law say... (No, she will live to be a hundred years old, her appetite is the same as a young person ```````` If she was born in a wealthy family, she would be blessed. There would be many relatives and friends to celebrate her birthday ```````` But, my family is very poor, and the children are hungry all day long ````````) These words are obviously the reason for the daughter-in-law's evil deeds, or the social basis, but these words are also a deceptive excuse. First of all, we must know that this story, this character, is only possible in a society like China that still retains feudal remnants. This grandmother, this daughter-in-law, and her entire family are completely products of feudal society. For example, this daughter-in-law is not only ordinary selfish, but also very vicious, but this kind of viciousness is a special phenomenon of feudal society being subjected to economic oppression.</p>
<p>People who grow up in Chinese feudal society, like this kind of person (daughter-in-law), can often be seen. Even when their lives don't feel economically oppressed, they still have to show their viciousness towards the thorn in their side, perhaps in a different way. I have personally seen the daughters-in-law of capitalist families acting out similar vicious things to a ninety-five-year-old (grandmother) as in this story.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our society still retains a strong feudal force. The faces of the characters who grow up in it may not be believable if the times pass. But, in any case, they are also components of the era and society, and we need to record them. This work is not necessarily unimportant in literature. Therefore, I specially offer my blessings here to this young writer of (Grandmother)!</p>

<h3 id="e343">Let's Talk About Diplomas Too <a href="#e343" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c343" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">343</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Recently, the discussions about (diplomas) in this publication have been really lively. I've been watching the excitement from the sidelines, and today I feel a bit itchy in my throat and want to join in and say a few words...</p>
<p>Diplomas really have the greatest magic power. It is said that they can solve people's life problems (problems of schooling and career, and even love problems can be satisfactorily solved because of it). Then you can imagine that it is really a great thing.</p>
<p>I heard that in recent years, schools have been very strict in checking (diplomas). Recently, I saw in the prospectus of X University the following written: (All freshmen applying to this school's colleges, departments, grades, who submit diplomas, the school will investigate with the original school after admission, if there are any fraudulent substitutions, alterations, or improper behaviors, once found, they will be immediately expelled...) In this way, the price of (diplomas) has been further increased, and there will certainly be no lack of people who sell or buy them at a high price. And the children of the petty bourgeoisie are willing to spend four years in university to buy an omnipotent (diploma). When we open the recruitment advertisements in the X newspaper, we can very strikingly see... (Our company wants to hire an XX member, who must be a university graduate, with a generous salary, please bring your graduation certificate to XX for negotiation).</p>
<p>Because I originally had the ambition to go to university, but I never formally graduated from high school, and there is no way to get a high school diploma. Therefore, you study diligently by yourself, preparing to taste the life of a university student, but in fact, you are listed among the abandoned; so the result of focusing on diplomas is that countless studious young people who have not obtained a graduation diploma and want to complete the final course of study can only be abandoned outside the university gate, and can only feel a sense of looking at the ocean and sighing.</p>
<p>Ah! The people of society pay so much attention to (diplomas), and the school authorities value (diplomas) so much, then how much more so do the rest of the people? However, this is ultimately an incomprehensible mystery!</p>
<p>In a novel, I once read these few sentences... (``````For a diploma, and a diploma is a qualification, is proof that you have spent so much capital, have bought so much knowledge... proves that you have a certain ability to handle affairs. But our society is so contradictory. On the one hand, it demands qualifications, on the other hand, most of the people who have food to eat do not have diplomas and do not have the ability to handle affairs commensurate with that diploma``````) Therefore, I often think... a diploma is just a piece of paper, whether it is genuine and of good quality can never be determined by unreasonable emphasis and stubborn belief.</p>
<h3 id="e344">Autumn <a href="#e344" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c344" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">344</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The sun sets on the edge of the western mountains, so dim and powerless, blurring the trees on the western mountains so that people can't see them clearly. A gust of wind blows, making the trees sway uncertainly. The distant sky has slowly closed in. On the threshing ground, there is no sign of the farmers' dinner. This is the bleak autumn season, also the autumn season where the farmer's only hope lies.</p>
<p>Agou can be considered a well-to-do farmer in this Xishan Town. He cultivates nearly a hundred mu of land owned by the landlord Lu, has two cows, and employs a long-term worker. Agou is called a "field rich man" in Xishan Town. However, when the new grain was put on the market last year, the grain price was particularly low. While ordinary farmers reluctantly sold their year's worth of sweat and toil at a low price, Agou relied on his solid foundation and experience told him that the price of new grain on the market was always lower than the price in the coming spring. Even if he borrowed money to repay the warehouse rent, the interest for one or two months would definitely be more than compensated for by the higher price in early spring of the following year. Agou, according to the usual annual practice, hoarded his new grain, borrowed seven hundred dollars at an interest rate of two cents, and cleared the warehouse rent within the first deadline (in the countryside, landlords open warehouses to collect rent, with ten days as a deadline, and an additional five sheng is added for each overdue deadline. For example, if 80% of the rent is returned, within the first deadline, each dan of rent is 8 dou, and after the deadline it is 8 dou and 5 sheng, and so on). He leisurely pursued his good dreams. Every day, he dragged his dry tobacco pipe to the small teahouse in town to inquire about the grain price. As the end of the year gradually approached, the grain price did indeed rise by five jiao compared to when it was put on the market. Agou calculated that if it could rise by one yuan in the spring, he would have a profit of seventy or eighty yuan. He calculated that he would still go to the teahouse every day. The waiter at the stove would call him "Agou Dad," which shows Agou's momentary prominence in Xishan Town.</p>
<p>With the sound of firecrackers, the old year is gone, and the Taofu are renewed with myriad sights. When people passed by the door of Agou Dad's house, he had already pasted the spring couplets written by Lu Xiucai, which was his annual practice. Every year, he always spent ten or twenty dollars to make it look like something; however, his good dream was not realized, but misfortune came knocking on his door with spring couplets pasted on it.</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the new year, Agou Dad dragged his dry tobacco pipe to the teahouse. The waiter at the stove shouted "Congratulations on getting rich!" to him. Agou Dad frowned his wrinkled face and said... (Little waiter, you get rich!) After paying a red envelope containing a silver dollar as white as snow, Agou Dad's smiling face disappeared. The grain price also became lower and lower day by day, falling to the price when the new grain was put on the market last year. When the peach blossoms bloomed in the Qingming season, the various creditors gradually pressed him tightly. After Agou Dad sold more than a hundred dan of grain he had hoarded, two cows were lost from his cowshed at the same time. Agou Dad's respectful title still existed in Xishan Town, but it gradually contained a sarcastic meaning... at least, in Agou's own ears.</p>
<p>Human hope is never exhausted. Naturally, Agou Dad's hope is also endless. Two cows and a bumper harvest would obediently lead him back to the cowshed. Although his wrinkled face no longer showed a smile, he worked even harder. His entire hope hung down from the sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>In the spring when the orioles were singing on the trees, Agou Dad's arms replaced the legs of the cows to loosen the soil; in the summer when the cicadas were chirping noisily, Agou Dad's legs were immersed in the poisonous hot paddy water to weed the rice. From morning to night, his entire life force was entrusted to the nearly hundred mu of land of the landlord Lu, that is, his entire hope turned into drops of sweat hanging down from his forehead. During a drought, he operated the waterwheel, just like the two cows last year. After several days of continuous rain, he drained the water, just like the two cows last year; however, his hope finally went completely bankrupt. Hurricanes came one after another. Some rice plants were dug up by the roots, some were broken in the waist, and even the ones that were leaning and struggling to survive were not even half of them.</p>
<p>The climate has already reached autumn, which is the time for the autumn harvest. The tenant farmers in Xishan Town, including Agou Dad, were like soulless wooden puppets. (Go to the countryside) When you shout this, have you ever thought about the situation in the countryside and reached out to help?</p>
<h3 id="e345">Deep Autumn <a href="#e345" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c345" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">345</a></h3>
<p>— Liaoyin</p>
<p>I haven't been out for a long time. Today, I went out for a walk by chance, and unexpectedly, I received many new feelings... I went out early in the morning and passed by a row of new shops, one after another. At the door of the shop, there were red threads and paper hanging, with big characters written (Sacrificing capital in the same industry competition), (Autumn big discount), (Matching code discount), (Buy one foot get two feet) ```````` and other store signs. But the eight folding doors were still tightly closed, but at the door of these three shops, a pile of people were crowded, vying for the closed-door soup, ah... what are they doing! In this year, (money is tight), can't you buy anything? Why are they so silly, standing and crowding early in the morning... The shop assistants are also lazy enough, why don't they come out quickly to welcome these large numbers of customers! After all, I vaguely understood it in my own heart, I need to ask it for a clear explanation! Later, one of the people in the crowd told me this... (Regardless of the newly opened stores or the exceptionally discounted old stores, when they run into the store in the early morning when the store opens the brand door to buy things, let you come out with whatever price value, even if you come out with an extremely low price to buy extremely high-priced goods, he can only reluctantly buy it for you, otherwise he will be (misfortune, at least for the whole day). Ah! What a flavorful report! The shop owner uses all his thoughts, racking his brains, to think of some profit-making and opportunistic speculative behaviors, making unreasonable profit-seeking ideas, and the public is even more making some perverted (extortion) methods. The human heart is a trap, so subtle to the extreme. In fact, they are preparing clothes for late autumn!</p>
<p>Ah! Really, it's late autumn, and the fashionable (young master), in addition to a suit and leather shoes, has added a jacket. The equally modernized fashionable (Miss) is also wearing a brand new 1934s jacket. In fact, what's the point of just adding this thin piece of clothing! Adorning the arrival of autumn, catering to the waves of the times!</p>
<p>(Autumn Big Discount, Two Weeks), major companies, and even small shops, are all fluttering with such red and green paper slips. People who are racing to be first run from this store to that store, and there is no shortage of them. Where should we start talking about the market depression? Seeing people carrying big bags of clothes home, I feel that the clothes on myself are thin and the quilt on the bed is thin.</p>
<p>Ah! It's late autumn, and people need to be very busy and especially busy again.</p>

<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>Written in memory of my Wanqing</p>
<p>The dim sky, the desolate air, envelop this world full of fishy smell, I can't see a bit of light... This kind of scenery makes people lazily produce endless melancholy, and in the depths of the soft heart is hidden the grief of a passion that has reached the extreme of resentment.</p>
<p>Wanqing's death was two years ago on the second day after the Double Tenth, and today is exactly two years! Her image is still vividly and freshly active in my mind from the day she died until now.</p>
<p>She and I were from the same hometown, the same school, and the same class, from elementary school all the way to high school. Her family was very wealthy, her mother was very kind, and her father was a pillar of the gentry team, but her personality was the opposite of her environment, shrewd and capable, daring to act, and under the impetus of the wheel of the times, she stood in the ranks of warriors, advancing as if she had no choice but to move forward, and finally she sacrificed her delicate body for that noble belief, dying in the bloodbath of the dark city of C.</p>
<p>I came to Shanghai four months before she died. Originally, we were going to leave together, escaping to any corner of the world, but she was trapped by her strict father and loving mother and couldn't get away. She informed me in her reply letter like this... (```````I am already impossible, you go first. However, the night before you leave, let the two of us be happy together, I want to commemorate this departure, in the past ten years, we have never had such a distant separation``````.)</p>
<p>When we parted, she cried, teaching me to be vigilant, teaching me not to miss her, and that's how I hurriedly left her in the midst of a symphony of voices and flutes! However, it was also in this way that I forever parted with her in the midst of a symphony of gunfire and screams!</p>
<p>One year has one National Day, and I have one scar every year. People are celebrating, excitedly, drunk and flushed, but I am shedding tears for a long time, reminiscing about my beloved, dizzy, resentful</p>
<p>In my eyes, the world is dead, blood-stained, terrifying, hideous, miserable... people have also lost the value of civilization, are cruel poisonous snakes, ferocious beasts.</p>
<p>In my heart, there is no hope at all that the world is</p>
<p>a living, peaceful thing, and there is no hope that people can advance and be great, create civilization, and benefit the world.</p>
<p>I only hope and believe that the living world is growing in the dead world, let these terrors, hideousnesses, miserableness, cruelties, ferocities ``````` be completely exposed, let these ugly things self-destruct, and the living world grows in the dead world, then peace, love, beauty and goodness will also grow in this terror, ferocity, and miserableness.</p>
<p>One year has one National Day, and I have one scar every year, until Wanqing is resurrected, and the living world arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e347">Sickness <a href="#e347" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c347" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">347</a></h3>
<p>— Liehuo</p>
<p>The young lady who was about to get married suddenly fell ill, and said that she was very ill... The most obvious thing was that she lay in bed all day long, and secondly, her appetite was greatly reduced. She simply hadn't eaten rice for two whole days.</p>
<p>The mother started to panic, on the one hand, she hurriedly hired someone to inform the husband's family, on the other hand, she personally went to the Guanyin Temple.</p>
<p>The young lady lying in bed was secretly overjoyed! To be honest... the illness was fake, it was pretended, because the husband's family was urging the marriage so fiercely, and the mother was also playing tricks, talking a lot of nonsense. She thought it over and over again, and was really struggling to find a suitable countermeasure, so she had to pretend to be sick. Now that the illness had been pretended, if the mother went to call a doctor immediately, or inform the father in X Port, the father would also come with the doctor. In this way, whether the gourd has medicine, and what kind of medicine it is, it would not be difficult for those ghost doctors to solve the mystery in one word.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the mother came back from asking the gods, saying that it was Bodhisattva making trouble, and she must invite a master to set up an altar to pray. If necessary, she would not be able to avoid making a wish to hold a jiao ceremony. The mother muttered, saying... (Inviting a master and making a wish to hold a jiao ceremony are all okay! It's just that why can't people live in this house, the feng shui in all directions is good, the facing is also good, and the house is also used. || First, the father was always unlucky and couldn't find a job, and last year Xiao Mao had smallpox one day) It was just an ordinary cold, and it actually ``````` Alas! Now you are sick again, what can be done?) The words seemed to be full of sorrow, especially the death of Xiao Mao, which made the mother a little palpitate.</p>
<p>The young lady listened, hiding a smile in her heart, but her face showed that she was out of breath, and the mother went to prepare a set of things to believe in the gods.</p>
<p>The husband's family, since the news was transmitted, only said that the illness should be seriously diagnosed. The young lady thought... what if it's not diagnosed, will you still come to greet me with a colorful sedan chair while I'm on the bed! Pricking up her ears, she heard the mother talking in detail with Xu Ma next door outside the door, vaguely, it seemed to be this set of tunes...</p>
<p>(It's really terrible, the gossip outside is increasing day by day, I'm not ashamed myself, but I'm embarrassed! The date has been set, but she's sick again, it's simply unjust!) It was the mother's voice.</p>
<p>(Originally, the world is very different. But this kind of gossip is not very compatible with our old ears after all! Some people outside say that your young lady is holding the hand of a male student and running on the street. It's not worth it for a woman to study! It's good that she's sick, otherwise it's inevitable that something will go wrong, don't blame Xu Ma for being quick to speak!)</p>
<p>(Yes! Thank you for your concern! || Alas, she's sick, I have to quickly believe in the gods for her!)</p>
<p>(Choking, choking, choking,) The young lady deliberately made a dry cough on the bed, meaning that she had heard their words.</p>
<p>The young lady's illness. After all, it was known to the father in X Port, who came back as soon as possible, and hired a famous doctor to diagnose her. The famous doctor didn't say anything after seeing her, obviously he didn't see the essence of the illness. The medical prescription was casual, and the medicine was decocted and offered in front of the young lady's couch. The young lady, behind people's backs, poured it under the couch. The young lady's illness, after all, medicine was ineffective, the mother muttered, and the father had no way, so he followed the mother to believe in gods and make wishes.</p>
<p>The husband's family heard the news that the young lady was getting more serious, and said that they wanted to take her over for diagnosis. The young lady only stepped on the bed board in the quilt, and the father also said that this was inconvenient after all and could not agree.</p>
<p>The result was that the husband's family sent a message... the wedding was postponed, and the mother also invited a master to pray, made a jiao ceremony, and made a wish in front of the statue of Lord Guan Di to offer oil lamps on the first and fifteenth of every month for three years, and the young lady's illness was cured. The mother boasted about her great achievements in front of the father, and the young lady watched the old woman take back a thick stack of peach-colored letter papers from the school in the room.</p>

<p>— Heren</p>
<p>The panic of unemployment, again and again grabbed my troubled, because bored, then often gathered four university seniors, talking about the way out for university students every day. Talking about this issue is like talking about women, you won't get tired of talking about it for a year. Yes, they will graduate next year, but what about the way out? So everyone is at a loss!</p>
<p>The self-employment introductions in the newspaper were all occupied by women, and there was no share for us men. Someone said... this is the end of men. In fact, I know that this exactly illustrates that it is still a man's world... Precisely because it is a man's world now, there is such a distorted phenomenon. However, in the man's world, we men actually have no way out, then how is that distorted?</p>
<p>After all, we are fellow long-gowns, we can't climb up, and we can't climb down, the times have decided our fate like this. But since we are born into the world, we have to live, just like a person has a mouth and has to eat and speak. But who gives us our life? There is no powerful old man behind us, and in front of us is a vast sky, an ocean without end, next year will only be a year, time passes quickly, we have no guarantee! One of our four senior university students suggested... (Let's be kidnappers.) However, is it easy to be a kidnapper? So we had to look down with our flirtatious</p>
<p>eyes.</p>
<p>Knowing that we can't climb up, and we can't tear our chests and sweat to pull a rickshaw as a proletarian, we can only wait with our hands tied for fate. Alas, the way out for university students! I know that there must be no lack of people who share the same fate with our four university students.</p>

<p>Youth B: How do you know these things?</p>
<p>Youth: How could I not know? The cook in his house told me. ``` But later, I don't know why, the county didn't send anyone to arrest me. Today, he ran to my house again, saying that the county government had official business and wanted to collect this year's taxes. I knew he was deliberately trying to mess with me, so I hid.</p>
<p>Youth B: Right, it's better to hide. He brought two security guards with him, ready to arrest people. He's a complete bastard.</p>
<p>Youth: X his mother, one moment sending soldiers, the next demanding debts, the next collecting taxes, treating us like we're not even human.</p>
<p>Youth B: A few days ago, Li Jichun's soldiers looted Huangjia Village once, and that was his idea. I heard that he and Li's army split the loot three to seven.</p>

<p>Youth D: Then what do we do? Are we just going to stay here and wait for them to kill us all with machine guns? I don't want to die, I'm still so young, why should I be killed by others? I don't want to die, I don't want to die!</p>
<p>Youth B: Have you gone mad? Won't you make things worse by shouting like this?</p>
<p>Youth C: What are we afraid of? As long as we're not the volunteer army, what can they do to us?</p>
<p>Youth: That's not right either. They definitely know we're not the volunteer army, but in order to consolidate their rule in Hebei, we young people will inevitably be slaughtered, because they think that only we young people are unwilling to be</p>
