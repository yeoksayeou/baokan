<p>時評</p>
<h3>對於二次高等考試報考人數之研究梓·</h3>
<p>昨日本報南京電第二次高等考試應試人數。已計就緒。共二千六百三十名。查二十年舉行第一次高等考試時。投考者爲二千一百七十七名今次應考人數。多於第一次四百五十三名。足見國難雖極深重士人求官之興不特未減。且益濃厚也。</p>
<p>此二千六百三十位之高等考試應試者。其經歷如何吾人現在無從知悉。然試檢查第一次應試者資格之統計。則大學畢業者占百分之五十五强專門學校畢業者占百分之二十六弱。軍警學校畢業專考普通行政警察行政者。占百分之六。檢定及格者。僅占百分之二。專門資格審查及格者不及百分之一。曾任官吏取得應考資格者。占百分之九。綜核言之。此熱心於高等考試應試之人出身大學及專門學校者。達百分之八十一。亦可見受高等敎育諸君。除應考求官以外。出路之少與謀生之難矣。</p>
<p>吾人不欲於國家甄拔人才之大政。有所抨議。更不欲對應試諸君尋求出路之舉。有所非難。惟借第一次高等考試報考者作比例。假定此次報考者二千六百三十人。大學專門學生仍爲百分之八十一。則此二千一百三十之大學專門畢業生。不能出其所學以獻身於社會。其事亦大可研究因所受敎育不適於辦理社會畢業乎。則大學敎育改良之問題生焉。因環境關係未能遂其服務社會之願乎。則社會現狀改造之問題起焉。因羨慕作官之榮利而羣趨於此途乎。則士習士風應行糾正之問題生焉。查上次應試二千一百七十七人中。取録者僅一百零一人。其未取之二千零七十六人中此次重行報考者。究有若干。現不能知倘考試院能就此有所宣佈。俾國人得明瞭上次見這諸君兩年來尋求出路之結果。亦大有價值之材料也。</p>
<h3>多瑙河經濟合作問題</h3>
<p>法意商得妥協</p>
<p>（日内瓦）據當局宣稱、意國前提出根據所謂［熟慮的合同］原則、以謀多瑙河經濟合作之建議、兹法意兩國已於此商得友好之妥恊、按小協約國曾反對此項計畫、尤以㨗克爲甚、而波蘭則並無不贊成之意向、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>美總統羅斯福</p>
<p>全力促進復興</p>
<p>另組農村放欵機關</p>
<p>警告勞資共拯國艱</p>
<h3>承認蘇俄最後報告繕就</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統經濟復興戰之新陳線、今日包含一廣大之活動塲地、一方面由總統嚴厲警言頑抗之實業家與囂張之勞工領袖、另一方面組織農村放欵新機關、又一方面則由國務院研究承認蘇俄後、經濟與政治上可能的結果、作成最後報告、</p>
<h3>勞資糾紛必須暫停</h3>
<p>總統之警告、發於勞工領袖剛普士紀念碑揭幕禮演說時、聲稱勞資糾紛、必須暫時擱置、以俟經濟復興戰奏凱之後、目下非求特殊權利與特别利益之時、繼乃論及一般狂妄勞工、認憑藉喧嚷暴行、可獲所欲結果者、聲稱、若輩應加入大多數工人共拯國家於艱危之中、嗣又警告心思專在金錢、而不顧人類生命之實業家、聲稱、大半雇主、皆能知國家所處之危境、但有少數頑梗者、必須加以覊勒、後乃稱譽剛普士之糾合無數勞工組織爲一大團體、勗勵工人、</p>
<h3>赫爾研究承認蘇俄</h3>
<p>至國務院内、則國務卿赫爾偕弼立德·貝彝爾·凱勒諸氏、研究承認蘇俄後所可期望之政治·經濟·與外交的結果、繕製最後報告、據今日呈報美總統者、預測俄國完全可以在美購買三萬五千萬元之貨物、使美國五十萬人獲得工作、又關於兩國樹立外交貿易關係手續之法律點、報告内亦曾論及、惟聞報告内容、全以所搜事實爲限、未附任何建議、</p>
<h3>放欵局先救濟棉麥</h3>
<p>農部方面、現亦集中全力於復興計劃、該部已恊同金融善後公司組織物品放欵局、先事救濟棉花小麥、對於願遵行政府减種計劃之農民、受其貨物、貨以押欵、凡願減少棉産農民、可將棉花每磅押欵一角、此事即歸該社承辦、將來並擬將抵抵押放欵計劃、推行於其他品、該社宗旨、一在平凖物價、樹立最低價格、一在接濟農社或農民之需欵、實施其改良計劃者云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福與鋼業會商</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）煤鋼兩業罷工區域現入於較爲寗靖之狀態中、國人乃移其目光於華盛頓、注視其恢復此兩業和平之新步驟、羅斯福總統現與鋼業領袖會商、擬促成最後解决、同時本塞爾凡尼亞州之罷工礦工糾察隊、雖在官場監視之下、仍悄然維持其糾察活動、國家復興案執行處顧問李芝堡聲稱、渠希望以煤業業現之實施、解决種種困難云、今日李芝堡與礦主礦工代表晤談甚久、據現象察之、如鋼業工人對於羅綣統調處工資爭執之謀、不允讓步、則羅總統將施用其權力、迅速解决之、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>軍縮會議今日重開</p>
<p>美政府嚴重表示</p>
<p>反對德國立卽軍備平等</p>
<p>德表示覆文有磋商餘地</p>
<p>（倫敦）軍縮會主席漢德森今日由倫敦起程前往日内瓦、任自十九個月前開會以來最爲吃緊之會議主席、瀕行時意興甚佳、按軍縮會休會後、漢德森曾在一二要點上主持談判、未獲有可使人確信恊定易於成立之進步、但在今日欲獲促成軍縮公約早日簽定之充分同意、尙非不可能事、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）此間可靠方面探悉、美政府認德國要求立即軍備平等爲遵從軍縮計劃代價一層、乃世界政局一嚴重發展、美代表台維斯所奉政府訓令、雖未發表、但信美國立塲、、將主張德國之回復武裝地位、當出之以漸、不能一蹴而幾、</p>
<p>德代表曾提議軍縮會議重開後、即將麥唐納所提公約一案舉行二讀、以便乘機提出德國立塲但聞法國將反對此議、故星期一之會議、對於進行手續、似將發生劇烈爭辯、一派主張立即進行制定公約、另一派即贊成暫緩公開討論、俾有私人談判機會、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府極重視日内瓦傳來德國要求有權重置軍備之消息、但在未接美代表台維斯正式詳報時、不欲遽有何行動、據今日負責方面消息、當他國一致主張軍縮之時、而有一重要國家竟悍然規畫重置軍備、則美政府定將視爲嚴重事件云、衆覺美國根據一九二一年美德正武停戰之條約、有向德國交涉之充分理由、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法外長彭古今日下午由巴黎抵此凖備出席下星期之軍縮談判、抵此復即與美代表台維斯及意代表阿洛錫等晤談、其後台維斯即赴羅馬晤墨索里尼、目前之情勢似較前爲佳、蓋德方表示彼等所提出之建議、尙有磋商之餘地云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>英主張干涉歐局</h3>
<p>（倫敦）昨日軍縮會議主席漢德森、在國際和平聯合會常年大會演說、對於英國向來奉行之［光榮孤立政策、］極力反對、認爲一種荒謬而不切實際之政策、樞密大臣保守黨首領鮑爾温亦在伯明罕保守黨大會再度聲明、英國對於本國曾經簽字之各項條約、必欲使人尊重之、此間星期日出版各報、對漢鮑兩人此項演說、重行評論、以爲［英國光榮孤立主義、現已根本結束、］例如泰晤士報星期刋、謂［將日内瓦與渥大瓦作爲對待之名詞、實爲不當之論調、蓋在從前無論有理與否、吾英尙可不問歐洲之事、自航空發達以來、吾人對歐洲之治亂、再不能袖手旁觀、因北海一葦之隔、不復能視爲可恃之城垣矣、］至於英國當以如何方式關心歐洲之事一層、則報界以爲唯一可能辦法、在於尊重條約、如［觀察報］云、［當德國侵犯比利時中立、吾英以履行中立條約名義、起而參戰、吾英人士、對於從前英國在保證中立條約簽字時之情形、猶能憶及者、恐無一人凡對英國之忠於羅卡洛條約懷疑者、觀此亦可釋然矣、］至於軍縮會議或將失敗一層、則以報均主張由各國分訂雙方條約以補救之、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）保守黨在白明漢開會、今日陸相海爾珊蒞會演講、其詞甚長、略謂吾人尚未解除軍備至安全之限度、此乃無庸諱言者、日内瓦英代表團已向國聯提出草約、而使軍縮會議復有生氣、此項草約能否見諸實施、現難逆料、如軍縮會不幸失敗、則負責者非爲英國、如失敗之責任不使應負者負之、則亦非英政府之過云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>法不欲危害他國</h3>
<p>法國維希　法總理達拉第今日在此間急進社會黨大會演說、謂吾人已自動依允犧牲軍備、此實歷史上所未前有、吾人並不夢想危害或凌辱任何國、而不問其政體爲何、吾人苟無國際恊定、不願續减軍備、而此國際恊定、必須具有誠懇好意、建設一種統制機關、俾得依序實行軍縮、達氏繼謂預算案必須平衡、數日内將召集國會、財政之改革在國會開會一星期中當可確定、否則須組織另一政府、達氏繼對於張伯倫在英保守黨大會所發英國共負歐洲之責任、並属遵維持歐洲和平之國際恊定之言論、表示滿意、並謂今無作凌辱德國之夢想、德政府旣抗稱其目的爲和平、則德國曷爲徵發國中少壯、又曷爲要求建造巨價戰具之權利、蓋軍縮公約果獲簽定而見諸實施、則其、要求之戰具、即須銷毁也云云、（八日路透電）　法急進黨大會</p>
<p>議决外交政策</p>
<p>對現政府完全信任</p>
<p>取銷戰債裁制侵略</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日極端社會黨大會通過凱塞所擬之議案、稱該黨對於一九三二年五月之後一切極派政府之外交方針、悉表同意、並稱、法國之外交方針、有繼續進行之必要、以期與國聯基本理想之精神相合無間而自由獨立實有保障之必要、尤以奥國爲然云、再則該黨之宣言後倡言廢止一切戰債、並願各國能成立包括下列各點之軍縮條約、（一）廢止私家軍備之製造及私人之軍品營業、（二）各國製造軍火之處應加以監視、（三）航空及化學工業應加以國際化、並應加以改造、以防止其爲侵略者之利用、嗣後如遇有侵略事件發生時、不論世界各國之國際監視、應即加以裁制、此外則試行期滿之後、軍縮計劃之應逐步進行者、應由軍縮約確實訂明、並應依照監視之實力而使生效云、（七日國民電）</p>

<h3>凖備對澳交涉</h3>
<h3>篇與西姆拉會議同樣渺茫</h3>
<p>（東京）澳洲政府之英帝國特惠關稅及實施傾銷稅計畫、經六日向村井駐雪藜總領事詢問結果、謂澳洲政府、自英國禁止金輸出以來、英鎊與澳鎊之間發生上落、即於對日匯兌、日澳問日金一元、爲澳元一先令六辦士、日英間則爲一先令二辦士、故根據一九二一年保護産業法之規定、俄然改訂關稅、成立對日貨得課以差别的關稅之規定、然其實施、必須向關稅委員會諮詢、至其是否立即實行、今尚未定云云、然澳改府之所以出此態度者、因日澳通商條約之交涉、將自今秋開始、故先期整飭準備、廣田外相昨電訓村井總領事、囑向澳政府抗議、一面對於締結通商條約、又命令凖備交涉、（電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）日對西姆拉會議對策、帶有重大之政治意義、在當面之目的、則謀解决通商問題、求日貨之銷路、在裏面則藉抵制印棉之方法、促成印度人之反英、削减大英帝國之反日之力量、英國明知裏面之事情、故特别拉攏印度取共同戰線、印度産業仍握在英資本家手中、雖英印資本家手中有因利害相反而對立、但由大局看來、其對印度農民之利害則一致、最近英印一致對日之原因在此、日方對英印之外交手段、僅有煽動印度農民而已、然而對於印農之對策、除取加緊抵制印棉、使農民蜂起以外、别無辦法、日印會議前途、甚感悲觀、聞日外部萬分焦急、如果西姆拉會果然失敗、則年底之日經濟界更不堪設想、廣田外相極力謀打開對華外交、欲以回復對華市塲之幻想、安定國内之人心、挽回經濟界之沉悶、（八日華聯電）</p>

<h3>殺</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>暗殺風氣，也並不是二十世紀的新發明，在耶穌降生以前，我們中國已玩着［魚藏劍］的把戲，猶如姑娘們不着袴子，在原人時代，已風行一時，不過到了這頭兒才發揚而光大之罷了。</p>
<p>上天有好生之德，所以造了人，順便再造了一座五臟廟，使愛生惡死的人們，會得吃飯，消化，登坑，或是說得紳士式些，如厠，以延續着生命，享受世界的繁華，嗜遍人間的痛苦。據說，人是有［活到壽終正寢］的義務的，所以暗殺没有［命盡禄絶］的人，法律是不容許的，非［緝兇歸案究辦］不可，而自殺，也是有背法律的，如前年的衞延殘，聽說也判了一個罪。</p>
<p>［殺人抵命］，一命抵一命，同時可省了世界上二個人的吃喝，是再合理化不過的了，但是劊子手也是幹白刀進，紅刀出的勾當的，却從未瞧見劊子手抵命的勾當。我於是乎知道法律超乎天理，上帝不及他所造的人聽明，因爲他雖然有好生之德，賦與每一個人以［壽終正寢］的義務與權利，可是人却會得造出殺人不抵命的劊子手來。</p>
<p>暗殺果然不可，自殺亦所不許，於是要有［性命出入］，除了坐待［壽終正寢］之外，惟有求敎於劊子手。但是我以爲除了劊子手之外，還有超乎劊子手者，呌做［有槍階級］。［有槍階級］儘可爲正義而戰，爲正義而［殺敵］。正義自然總不悖乎天理，所以劊子手只能以法律爲護符，而殺幾個　包的犯人，惟有兵士才可［上順天心］而殺死上百上千上萬鮮靈活跳，敢作敢爲的［敵人］。這才是合乎天理，而且是再也價值不過的［殺］。</p>
<p>但是在這年頭兒，一有外侮，軍士都不忍殺而向後走。犯人被判了死刑，上訴到改判爲無期徒刑才止，於是劊子手間得無人可殺。惟有自殺，最是流行，而暗殺也日形發達。我眞識不透兜竟這是一個甚歷世界。</p>
<h3>餓的經騐</h3>
<p>— 金子</p>
<p>在中國，打一兩歲的少孩子起，一直到裝着滿口假牙齒的老公公老太婆爲止，可說没有一個人不在那裏䖍誠恭敬地奉行着飽食主義，不惜害胃病，害腹瀉病的儘量吃喝着，非至吃到捧着肚子站不起來不止。所以，從前有位外國人說，十個中國人每天所排洩的糞，是抵十五個外國人兩天排洩的糞而有餘，實在不是假話。因此我常常在想，如果有人出個題目，要大家做一叚形容餓的文章，結果一定會收到九十九份白卷，其中一份非白卷必然是那些漸有變胖趨勢的摩登女郎們底手筆。這一層幻想便促成了我自已的試騐，某一日的上午起，我就下了絶大的决心，開始實行爲寫文章而絶食的絶食。</p>
<p>當天上午十二時前，居無毫無變化，肚子裏雖然微微地在作響，可是一經澆</p>
<h3>名言録</h3>
<p>有歷史意義的世界經濟會議，聚各國之俊傑於一堂，唇劍舌鋒，各逞雄辯，其中頗多警惕之詞，爰于讀報之餘，集爲名言。</p>
<p>余願對於英屬自治地與印度之代表，予以特殊之歡迎。（英皇）</p>
<p>世界失業人數，竟達三千萬之多，（英相麥唐納）</p>
<p>欲使他國貧之，適使自已貧乏，（同前）</p>
<p>宜提倡大規模公共工程，以吸收失業（法總理達拉第）</p>
<p>宜成立每週四十工時制，致力於勞工之整理（同前）</p>
<p>政治之糾紛不解决世界危機不去（德外長牛賴資）</p>
<p>黄金苟不能自由流通，則金幣將毫無意義（同前）</p>
<p>相互有益之市塲，僅能以商業政策之解放得之（美國務卿赫爾）</p>
<p>近來舉行之國際會議，往往開會時均有相當之誠意，但其終結時，不但相反，且引起不幸之結果；（蘇聯外交人民委員長李維諾夫）</p>
<p>今日世界之病，非由於生産過剩，而實由於購置力之低减（德代表胡根培）　中國僅有鐵路七千哩而美國則有二十七萬五千哩，中國有汽車大道二萬哩，而美國則有三百萬哩（中國財長宋子文）（靜子）</p>
<p>，不讓我的腦神筋想到吃飯的兩個字上去。這樣枯坐了一個鐘頭，精神漸漸地疲倦了，不能自主的呵欠，也一次兩次的打出來了，口腔裏的唾液，似乎比尋常多了許多，而且甜膩得很，吐去了一滿口，不到五分鐘又滿了，那情形完全和暑天裏將起霍亂吐瀉病前一般無二，但是我竭力忍耐着，勉强又坐了半個鐘頭，才慢慢地走出園去。可是這時候的腿，却和進園時的腿有些不同了，每走兩步路，祇抵得尋常的一步路，而移動時的速度，也漸漸地減低了。當我走過一家小飯館時，櫃台上所安着的幾盆黄荳芽，猪脚肉之流，齊像金鋼鑽似的發出了萬丈光芒，在我的眼前炫耀着。　和碗的相撞聲，掩過了電車的鈴聲，汽車上的喇叭聲而直剌入我的耳膜，使我幾次三番的把我的頭頸旋過去。好容易挨進了寫宇間，一杯白開水便像仙露似的吞了進去，然而不停的呵欠，和滿口以半杯白開水，便寂然不聞矣。吃飯的時候，我因爲惟恐看見了人家吃飯要熬不住，特地溜到外灘公園去靜坐，而且還全神貫注地看着黄浦江裏來往的船隻的唾液却已把我累得不能再工作了。就在似睡非睡，似病非病的狀熊中，耐坐到了五點鐘，一出公事房門口，第一個慾望就是想找一家飯館，偏是最先遇到的乃是一家大餅店，其時的大餅，在我看來眞有金子一樣的可愛，芝蘭花一樣的馥郁芬芳了。結果就在人行道上，結束了我的十小時的絶食。</p>
<h3>成都歸客談</h3>
<p>— 王指邨</p>
<p>中華新藥學會，此次派常務委員，葉善定君，赴長江各埠，接洽會務，兹已事畢畢返滬，承告成都聞見，彌饒興趣，記憶所及，濡筆誌之</p>
<p>▲烟館多於飯館　成都鴉片盛行，售價特廉，大銅元一枚，（值二百文）即可飽吸一頓。市民十九嗜此，故烟館隨處皆有，飯館反不多見。往往饑腸轆轆，無處可以果腹，而癮君子，反得隨時吞雲吐霧也。</p>
<p>▲蜀人不喜吃榨菜　滬上盛銷之四川榨菜，蜀人都不喜食，菜餚中，鮮有用榨菜者。</p>
<p>▲峨嵋山無高僧　裨史說部，每稱峨嵋山多高僧，我人雖不信其具有佛法，總以爲必多高齡厚道者。實則絶然相反，所謂峨嵋山高僧，都係形消骨立之癮君子耳。</p>
<p>▲理胡與香蕉　該地生活程度極低，</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>往日也開拔着上火線去過，但是事前多少有點消息。二來造　表册上去，也還免不了三天五天的躭擱。何以這次如此的急促，也就可怪了？只是團長召集會議，這是隔了一個階級的長官，當然違抗不得，只有早早的趕了去，免得誤卯。他如此想着不敢有五分鐘的猶豫，也就到了團部裏了。一張大餐桌子，正中坐了團長，三個營長，左一右二，換了團長坐下。連長們究竟有些胆怯怯的，遠遠的，坐在大餐桌子這邊半截地方。團長先將目光將大家看了一下，然後正着顔色，站了起來道今天上午六時，我接到旅長的命令，我們的軍隊，馬上就要開拔，現在限定各營在四十八小時以内，把開拔的手續，一切都要凖備好了。他說這一套話時，臉色都是很莊重的。說完了，他臉上似乎帶有一些笑容，就對大家放大了一點聲音道關於給養一層，當然不能照平時給養給我們師旅長已經會和我們去呈請。以後每連可以按月報民夫十八名，馬十六匹，給養是照給。九個連長坐在那裏，聽了給養照給四個字，心裏似乎各得了一種安慰，互相的看了一眼。團長道開拔費也大致規定了每連可以在團部裏暫借二十元。這一句話把在座的一批連長們，都驚得呆了，不敢向團長望着，只好向營長望着。都心想，這次開拔，當然是負着很重大的責任，現在說是開拔前方每連只給二十元，二十元一百多人分，請問一個人攤了多少，就說弟兄們分文不給，拿來作雜費，可是三個排長，一人開口借五塊錢的話，在這種時候，似乎也不能不給。此外上士司務長，誰能說不借一塊兩塊的完當連長的人，只有白瞪眼，那裏還有錢？當兵的人，駐防得久了，都希望開拔，找幾文開拔費，可是像這個樣子，那就希望毫無了。（二○九）</p>
<p>即以酒席一項而論，在上海須十一二元一席者，成都不過售三四元。惟理髮與香舊特昻，至中等理髮室理髮一次，價須七角五分，香蕉每隻約售大洋一角一二分。</p>
<p>▲市民拒用升水鈔票　滬票市上不　通行，須先至兌換處換取蜀票，每百元可升十餘元，惟須整百兌換。照理此項滬票，旣有水可升，當受市民歡迎，不意反遭拒用，此中原因，實難索解。</p>
<p>▲乾隆之羅漢身　峨嵋山塑有羅漢五百尊，容貌神情，各各不同，中一尊係清帝乾隆像，聞山僧言，其於南下時，曾自比羅漢，戲而塑此。</p>
<p>▲猴羣奇觀　各山多猴，尤以峨嵋爲最。余向寺僧購荳一握，散於寺前，寺僧高呼［兒啊］，即見巨猴一頭，奔躪而出，對客略一審視，乃長嘯一聲，羣猴聞聲咸出，數難確計，聳步攀枝，爲狀殊趣。</p>
<p>▲銀耳價昻　四川爲銀耳出産地，而價格反較外省爲昻，劣者每兩售三四元，佳者須十元一兩。</p>
<h3>花瓶與花瓶架子的檢討</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>前天在本埠增刋上看見一篇華女士的［花瓶歟花瓶架子歟］之後，覺得有些不自然。</p>
<p>近年來，［花瓶］成爲一般有職　的女士的通稱了。這奇特的名詞究竟起於何人何時，我没有這工夫來作一度的考據，大約總是在最近幾年所發見的新名詞吧？！［花瓶］這名詞到底是什麽意義，也很使人費心思。如果說女士們在公司或機關中好像是一座美麗的陳設品，因而稱爲［花瓶］，那末，我以爲花瓶是挿花的，没有花也顯不出花瓶。花瓶有了，但是花又是誰呢！？</p>
<p>現在，又來了一位華女士提倡一個［花瓶架子］的美稱。華女士爲了受不了［花瓶］之稱而以架子爲抵抗的名詞，我以爲是十二分的不妥。花瓶擺在架了上，這無異是說女士被男士提高着。說得難聽些，是女士必需依賴男士方才可以增高女士的一切。再換句話說，女士的一切都是男士所養成的；更進一步說，女士還要依賴着男士，不能自顯其才能。爲什麽呢？試想花瓶如無花瓶架子就不顯得美觀，有了花瓶架子才顯出花瓶的美麗啊！</p>
<p>所以我說［花瓶架子］之稱是不妥當的。那不是對［花瓶］的報復，那簡直是對［花瓶］的稱呼更多一層的承認！</p>
<p>可是，我並不是說［花瓶架子］之稱不妥，要請女士們更想一個别的名字來挖苦男士。花瓶的稱呼中包含着不少的侮辱成分。想出這個名詞的人徒然自覺難堪，自卑自賤而已，這對於别人是毫無關係的。眞金不怕火來燒，那些閒言是一些妨礙都没有的。做人是做自已的人啊！</p>
<p>有自尊心的决不會將這些名詞加於他人之身的。無論如何，社會是需要互助的，决不是男士或女士片面所能成立的，又何必投桃報李，一個花瓶一個架子的，向那些不堪的傢伙作無謂的報復呢？</p>

<p>（尚有北平華北醫報。今已停版。慈幼拒毒等刋與醫藥有關。兹不贅入）看了以上的表格。可以知道不下幾點。（一）全國各埠各種刋物總數。僅如上海一埠。新醫在内地的不發。可想而知。（二）各地二十二種刋物中。除了專門八種。民衆通俗的二種以外。普通體裁相同者。又是十二種之多。（三）一地而有數種刋物的。是杭州·廣州·南京·三處。此外六省中。只有九種刋物。（四）湖北·湖南·河南·雲南·貴州·江西·廿肅·安徽·山西·四川·青海·新疆·西藏·十三省。恐怕簡直没有醫刋。</p>
<p>總括以上兩張表格。以及所提出之各點。覺得有幾項結語可說。（一）上海醫藥刋物之多。多得可怕。恐各國大埠。無此熱鬧。（二）新醫不發的區域。索性没有刋物。而較發達的區域。就一地有許多刋物。各自爲政。各刋其刋。在交通不便的中國。固然有各地分出刋物的必要。然而在一條寗滬杭的路線上。就有三十種之多。也未免過火。倘使有人說中國人不合作。實在無可圖答。（三）各種刋物的定期。因材料關係。分爲旬刋。半月刋。月刋。季刋等等。質量輕重不一。經濟偏倚不匀。雖說出版自由。究竟容易失敗。决非恃久之道。（四）四十幾·種刋物。大都僅拿［新·醫·藥·衛生·大衆·民衆·科學·］幾個字顚來倒去。定爲名稱。使讀者覺得名稱混淆得頭痛。</p>
<p>凡此種種。都是醫藥出版界。偏重主觀方面［傾吐爲快］。而没有注意到客觀方面［接受興趣］的毛病而已。</p>

<p>按此種藥商刋物在各國。近年本來狠通行。牠的内容。無非將本廠出品原來必需報告的藥理作用。生理作用等說明書。彙集攏來。再加上各大醫院各名醫。對於該藥採用之經騐。又從各醫學雜誌中。摘録各醫院各名醫對於某病等之新療法。於本廠出品有關者。加在裏面。編輯成册。按期出版。所聘編輯人員。也狠有醫界上飽學之士。如今上海各洋行所出。無非是這種［新療法報告］的摘譯本。他的内容。不免有偏重宣傳的意義。而最大缺點。就是譯本中材料。不能證明該藥在中國醫療上的立塲。究竟如何？。所以醫界有根柢的人。拿來作一參考的固無不可。而一般醫家。竟拿他當作敎科書讀。而貿然賞用其出品。那簡直［只讀治療學而如法泡製的］醫術。就不免有些小小不妥了。</p>
<p>（勘誤）上期本文中［新聞報新醫藥刋］爲［民衆醫學］之誤植合亟更正</p>
<h3>焦易堂爲採行國醫條例告國人書之商榷（續）</h3>
<p>— 余·雲·岫·</p>
<p>披氏所舉的一例，輕瘥是輕瘥了，但尿中的結核菌和白血球，依然還可以證明，算不得到達治愈的境域。我却有一例，比他來得明顯··九年前，我有一個同僚，害了隱尿症，把他的膜尿施行動物試騐，結果，證明是僱側的腎藏結核，然而這位同僚，至今還是健康地生存着，執行業務，全無障碍，尿也澄清了，細菌亦絶跡了，這是未曾加以手術而治愈的實例。雖然如此，······我觀察到多數症例，凡拒絶手術，和因别種事故，行不得手衞的人們，結果大都不好。上文所述我的同僚，乃是自然治愈。······現在且把想像的空論擱去了，就事實上考覈起來··把我的同僚自然治愈的一例，和稍稍有點疑問的披氏一例，做個一方面的事實；和這事實相對照的，却有我們許多手術的赫赫功績。我用手術把結核性賢藏摘去的事，計有六十七回，就中手術死的有六人，就是死亡率占到百分之八點九，丨八·九％丨就是有九十一分以上可以靠得住，其餘，因了其他藏府結核病進行而死的有三人，其餘被手術的，都是恢復健康，把劇甚難堪的病苦，都能消散了，體重增加自十磅至四十磅。······就統計上覈起來，手術成績的良好程度，還一在年一年地增加着。最近作所施行腎藏摘出手術的四十三人裏面，死亡的只有二名，僅僅占到百分率四點六，丨四·六　丨了]。</p>
<p>焦先生吓！國人吓！請把這段論文仔細想一想！卡氏雖然有了自已同僚的實例，他認爲是自然治療··根據他的實騐，一方面不行手術的大多數症例，都是結果不好；一方面，手術的成績，却有百分之九十五是靠得住的；他完全從醫事統計學上立脚，還是主張手術。他的議論的確實性，恐怕比較焦先生所舉零零碎碎偶發的症例，要確實得許多呢。但是腎藏結核，是有用保守療法可以治愈的事，根據何君，和吳子琴先生外孫，以及卡司湃爾同僚的事實看起來，是可以無欵的了。</p>
<p>我看胡君適之這個人斯斯文文的，我疑心他身體上有潛伏性的結核，他從前所害的，我也疑心是腎藏結核。那末，他的治愈，和卡司湃爾的同僚一樣，也是自然治愈，在表面上看起來，似乎是主張姑息療法的人們占勝利，從學術上探討起來，當然還是主張割除的人們爲是。陸仲安不過在自然治愈的發財票裏面，得了彩就是了，在學術上值得什麽？一班大驚小怪的人們，都是不從學理探討。試看胡君自已，他很，做文章，他是近代白話文的祖師，他艱道不會說幾句介紹文，介紹治好他痼疾的恩醫，告告國人，傳傳後世？何以他只有口頭贊揚，一字也不肯輕易落筆呢？這就是胡君的苦衰，胡君的識力，胡君的學問，胡君的價值，焦先生對之，能無慚愧？</p>
<p>所以從學理上探討起來，焦先生所舉的幾個例，也只好歸到［幸中偶合］四個大字範圍裏面去，此外，有什麽　詞可以贊呢？老實對焦先生說，因爲我素來研究中國醫書，於是社會上的人們，碰着貴國醫所看不好的病，帶了一大疊貴國醫的處方，到我這兒來，要求我診治，要求我批評的，一日之中，總有數起。就中診斷錯誤，用藥診妄，狠可發笑的，固然不少。就是陸仲安看不好的病人，我也治過許多，他的處方，我也拜見過許多了。但是我從來不肯在文字上批評某某醫生活療實例的好醜，我以爲成敗論人，固然不是批評的上法，而且大有業務上排擠的痕迹，所以不願意做。今天陸仲安的話，是焦先生引起來的，不能不發表點竟見。</p>
<p>焦先生說··一他們因爲不肯承認自已有欠缺，所以不主張有他們西醫行外，更有國醫的存在，他們非但不肯接受國醫的是處，來參加提倡，他們還認處於國醫之對敵的地位而倡議</p>
<p>廢止。·········退一萬步說··西醫的文明，是逐日在進展，前面所舉的諸種症候，現在已都有了辦法，總括一句，學術上不成問題了，我們又要問，西醫現經登記得的，全國不過二千餘，人應付於全國四萬萬人口，是否分配得夠？我先要問焦先生，從學理上探討起來，貴國醫還有存在的可能麽？對於學術上稍有頭腦的人，稍有良心的人，在今日時候，誰都承認貴國醫的學理是完全靠不住，是要消滅的。換一句說··就是完全可以廢止。所以廢止舊醫的原則，誰都不能摇動。國人若是有毅力，有秩序，曉得世界潮流，和學術的沿革，從這個原則上討論辦法就是了，焦先生所提出的人口分配問題，當然也應該討論的。在民國十八年，我在中央衞生委員席上，提出了廢止舊醫議案，我就擬了妥善的辦法··我是說以十九年底爲止，把舊醫的徒子徒孫，只要滿二十歲以上的，都　起無條件的登記，給他個終身營業的權利，但是此後不許再産生了。國人請想一想，從二十歲開業起，平均計算，開到六十歲爲止，足足有四十年期限，就是，等到舊醫完全廢止</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>的時期，足足要在四十年之後。用科學醫替代舊醫分配人口的事，也足足要有四十年的工夫，方才可告完成。這四十年中，舊醫當然陋舊開業，照舊分配人口，怕什麽不鉤分配？若是過了四十年，我們貴中國還是不長進，還是和現在一樣，我恐拍已經亡國許久了，有不着我們來分配哩。我的提案，我的辦法，是四面八方照顧周到的。當時舊醫，對於自已的學理，完全没有覺悟，連用科學方法整理的話，還没一個人肯承認，說聲廢止，當然立刻就氣衝萬丈，那裏肯把我的提案平心靜氣去研究，就以爲立刻要廢止，立刻就没飯喫，人民立刻没有醫生，藥店立刻没有生意，風起雲湧，起了一個大風潮，政府也就糊裏糊塗，把這件議决案擱起來了。這一回事，是完全用虛僞的宣傳，來煽動國人，蠱惑政府，何曾和我的提案相符呢？到了今日，焦先生還要持這種論調，用這種手叚，可笑不可笑呢？</p>
<p>焦先生說［再從國民經濟說，近年相信西醫，服用西藥的，只不過資産階級之極小部份人數，但已作成西藥人口年銷一萬萬元，比之國藥出口年銷約四千餘萬元者，已須損失約六千餘萬元之巨，假令國醫廢止，全國平民大衆都來服用西藥，那麽每年西藥人銷價額，又不知增加幾許萬萬元。］這種議論，從表面看來，是很動聽，所以近年來，當做國醫們苟延殘喘的口實。其實是幼稚得極，是閉關時代的議論，不是根本救國的正法。請看絲茶兩項，從來是我們中國獨占貿易品，近來衰落得不得了，不但出口减少，而用大宗進口來，這不是有西絲學家，西茶學家，在國内提倡見國貨，是科學不發達，優勝劣敗的天演公例，當然結果。國藥西藥，也是一樣，如果開倒車下去，揤使國内　有西醫，總會得一天一天地衰落下去，這是不可逃避的因果律。現在趕快迎頭上去，還有達到自已製造的一日，若是逆着世界潮流，要想把國醫抵制科學醫，把天然産物的草根樹皮抵制科學藥，休要夢想！絲茶兩項，是前車覆轍，應該猛醒！焦先生還在這裡睡覺麽？再看軍事，交通，敎育，工商等等，那一事不需要外國貨，難道都不曉得漏巵兩個字麽？過渡時代，欲罷不能，只有拚命追趕上去，達到自造目用的地點，是一條生路，閉關主義，是誤國的政策吓！小不認則亂大謀！唉！焦先生吓！自從前清道光以來，閉關主義的失敗史，歷歷可按，這條亡國路，是不可以再走的吓！請眼光放遠一點，計劃宏大一點，總理科學救國的遺訓，是千不錯，萬不錯的，放着膽，照着總理指導一直走去，還有出頭的日子，不要三心兩意！進化的潮流斷斷是抑遏不信的，開駛倒車，前途只有失敗滅亡四個字恭候着！</p>
<p>焦先生說［另一方面，國内的醫生藥業工人以下，直接間接從事於藥業勞動的農民，總共亦不下數千萬人，這數千萬人，一旦陷於失業，國家將如何給予救濟，國際貿易之入銷的價額，及國内失業的人口，同時激增，引起國民經濟之全盤的摇動，是應該誰負責任？我們從醫學成績看，從醫生分配看，從國民經濟看，廢止國醫，顯然是不可能的事情。］焦先生這種論調，這種思想，眞是不可理解。照我的計劃，並不是一兩日内，要把舊醫勦滅凈盡，至短還有四十年的期限，焦先生偏會說數千萬人一旦失業，一旦兩個字是揑造的。用西藥的醫師，也不是像齊天大聖拔一撮毛，一刹時可以變成功的，至少也要四十年期限，焦先生偏會說同時激增，引起國民經濟的全般摇動，同時激增四個字，是深文周内。這種言論，不但是錯誤，不但是杞人憂天，似乎近於謡諑誣罔了。（未完）</p>
<h3>中藥西用（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>▲（十四）丁香Ｃaryopbyllus</p>
<p>本原</p>
<p>本品爲桃金孃科（Ｍyataccae）植物丁香（ＥngeniaＣaryophyllataＷilld）之乾燥花蕾也，採摘或繫落烟薰日晒，使成褐色，用以入藥，</p>
<p>性狀</p>
<p>本品現暗棕色，或棕黑色，子房爲鈍四稜性之長圓柱形，上部分爲兩室，存有種子，共約二十個，子房之上，爲一四裂之萼，萼之内則爲四片花瓣，花瓣之内，包藏多數彎曲之雄蕊，及一個雌蕊柱頭，臭佳適而强烈，味香而辛，後又有輕微之麻痹感覺。</p>
<p>成分</p>
<p>本品含有揮發油即丁香油，約一五至二○％之多，其油質較水重，投於水則沉降，其所以較水重者，因油是鳥軋拿兒（Ｅngenel）所組成，其香氣亦由烏軋拿兒而生，其他尙含膠質，樹指，鞣酸，蓚酸等。</p>
<h3>試騐</h3>
<p>本品之完全成熟者，其香氣微弱，應採取未開之花蕾，其佳良品，香氣峻烈，香油豐富，壓於紙面上，當留油漬，本品投入水中，應縱直浮游於水面，或沉入水底，其油質抽出者，或陳舊品，因油質消失，横浮水面。</p>
<h3>效用及貯藏法</h3>

<p>丨通俗談話丨</p>
<p>某某先生大鑒，每日於無線電中得聆大論，如親接譬欬於一室之中，良用欣幸，先生本服務社會之精神，作醫學常識之演講，民衆固日增長新知，同道亦獲温其舊習，其爲裨益，寧有量耶，連日所講結核問題，證明斯症之在中國牛乳非傳染之主因，尤見卓識，而推其癓結，歸於隨地吐痰之惡習，苦口婆心，極堪欽佩，惟以弟個人觀察，吐痰雖足以傳播病菌，然究不若共食制度爲害之烈也，蓋痰吐於地上，而菌播於空間，日蒸之而上升，風颺之而四散矣，即有一二病菌，由呼吸器管以侵入人體，亦復爲數甚微，爲害亦不至於過烈也，到於共食之際，杯盤交錯，肴核紛陳，一羹也，羣涎之所匯，一菜也，衆箸之求歸，座客之有肺病與否，不能預知，知之亦無法以避免也，於是一飲一啄之内，而多數之病菌，乃由著勺之傳遞，而展轉深入於肺腑之中矣，故結核症之傳染，共食制度乃其根原，較呼吸傳染爲尤甚焉，以百年來觀察，爲例亦多，往有友人，曾患斯症，所生子女，至四五歲時，均致頸核腫大，呈淋巴腺結核症狀，雖爲害不深，而身體均弱，其後問計於弟，乃勸其分食，自　所生乃絶無以上之現象，Calmette氏爲法國結核專家，曾於結核症傳染之原因，作實地之研究，法以羣鷄豢於二處，一則播癆菌於鷄牢之空間，一則和癆菌於鷄食之器内，其試騐之結果，由飲食以傳染者十之八九，由空氣以傳染者殊寥寥也，此足爲鄙說之一證矣，總上所言，共食之制度不除，癆菌之傳染乃永無杜絶之希望，先生以仁者之心腸，謀民衆之幸福，故敢略陳鄙見，以爲尊說補充，其亦於結核傳染之預防，或有小補也耶，書不盡意，伏惟鑒察，即頒著安，弟宋國賓頓首</p>
<p>[P歐洲之藥學敎育育與藥師資格之養成（三）</p>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>五、腦威藥學校。只有奥斯洛大學之藥科。其藥師資格之養成。爲曾在藥房練習三年之學生。入奥斯洛大學。受藥學之短期敎育三或四個月。乃從正式藥師學習經騐一年。再受大學功課二年。（倘學力優越習一年半者亦有之）。換言之。即腦威之藥齋師資格養成。先後共需六年。丨二年大學課程。四年習地經騐。更有多數藥師爲藥房助手繼續任事甚久者。而近來該大學藥學敎育採取一種新學制。其課程大槪如下。</p>
<p>（一）三學期自然科學。丨化學。物理。植物學。及短期之藥。房習地功課。　　（二）三學期之藥房服務。</p>
<p>（三）習畢藥化學。藥品工業化學。生藥學。細菌學。飲食物化學。及衛生與商業等課目。</p>
<p>腦威藥典當然爲國家所定。且設有永久委員會名DenFarmacopoKimmsson　o在一八九八年所組織者。爲大學醫科敎敎授三人。藥科敎授六人。委員長即大學校長鮑爾宋博士。一九一三出版之藥典。近已進行修改。而委員會之組織。亦加擴充。</p>
<p>六、伊大利藥學敎育之機關。有羅馬。托里諾。派維亞。旁洛拿。等大學之藥學科。其學制爲四年正科。及三年實習。又有專爲修習藥化學。及其他科學博士學位。而設之五年研究科者。</p>
<p>七、比利時之藥商亦有一定資格。藥典爲國家所規定。藥師須受四年比利時大學課程。及一年藥房實習。其畢業學位爲藥化學師。</p>
<p>藥學敎育之在歐洲。若英。若法。若德。課程之完備。可代表全歐一切國家。而其藥師資格之完成。賦有充分藥房實地經騐。以達藥師執業之最終目的。學理不至空踐。經騐亦有所本。際此建設時代之吾國。在在需材。端賴敎育。環顧全境。正式藥學校不過三兩而已。故整理藥業。無從措手。深盼敎育當局與衞生機關。合力圖之。誠爲當務之急耳。　　（完）</p>

<p>狼吞虎嚥　車甫發動、足球隊諸將首先發難、籃球隊網球隊隨後接應、浩浩蕩蕩奔向餐室、侍者無法維持、鄭兆佳等親自出馬、一時狼吞虎嚥、杯盤狼藉、煞是好看、女選手畢竟客氣、不與男選手爭一日之短長、</p>

<h3>粤港選手昨晚過滬赴京</h3>

<p>▲香港足球將來滬再比賽</p>
<p>爲人注目之廣東香港兩選手圖均於昨日到滬、廣東搭日本皇后號於下香四時抵埠、香港乘渣華芝尼加拿號到此、除香港足球隊下午作友誼比賽一塲外、其餘均毫無動靜、皆匆匆於昨晚搭夜快車入京、</p>
<h3>廣東</h3>
<p>由金曾澄率領、全團男女選手一百七十人、其足球隊前傳四騎士將代表出席、昨來者祇李天生棄北華二人耳馮量祥譚江柏因職務關係、不能請假脫身、陳鎭和亦未來、實力方面、不免損失、除足球外、排球游泳、最具希望、女子組田徑亦甚平均、排籃棒球、均抱極大希望、足球隊之名單如下、黄紀良、盧始賢、胡天寳、葉北華、李金、李天生、劉慶才、朱國倫、李鴻清、楊水益、符家興、黄炳郎、李蘇、區宏恩、蕭殿廉、</p>

<p>爪哇少年網球冠軍</p>
<h3>許承基昨抵滬</h3>
<p>今晚偕林續胤同入京</p>
<p>返滬後將往日本觀摩</p>
<p>最可注意之爪哇兩網球家許承基林讀胤兩君、昨日上午、搭芝尼加拿號自吧城抵此、將於今晚搭夜車赴京、明晨卽出席全運開幕大典、</p>
<h3>氣候塲地關係</h3>
<p>許君謂、此次返國、成績如何、殊難預說、因南洋天氣較熱、來此覺甚寒、故身體方面、頗加注意、且塲地亦有關係、南洋皆水泥硬地球塲、此次南京尙不知爲草地抑硬地、球則常拍使樂人交牌、故萬一不得勝利、只可謂之經騐不足、</p>
<h3>最近在吧戰績</h3>
<p>許君年僅二十一、今年又膺全爪哇之冠軍、决賽以六比二、六比三、擊敗日人藤田、許君於一九二九年卽得中爪哇冠軍、次年得全爪哇錦標、一九三一及三二、則爲爪哇華僑冠軍、今年又重獲全爪哇錦標、許君與林君、合組雙打、今年亦獲爪哇之雙打錦標、林君年已三十二、球亦愈老愈壯云、</p>
<h3>全運比賽觀察</h3>
<p>許君對全運錦標之把握、謂抵此方知全運僅賽三組、二勝者得勝、對上海之複賽、許君大約對邱飛海、君謂在爪哇曾二次擊敗之、此次如仍在爪哇、勝利可有把握、但在南京則難說、因氣候塲地用球、皆有關係也、林續胤對王文正、必甚劇烈、雙打許林對鄭余、亦大可觀也、</p>
<h3>返滬再往日本</h3>
<p>自京回滬後、勾留一星期、作數塲比賽後、卽偕林君往日本、作游覽比賽、藉以觀摩、日本網球、人才不少、卽南洋亦然、日本之山田、皆係許君友好、曾來函邀兩君昨日下午在約翰大學作練習比賽、今日將再在他處練習云、</p>

<h3>香港隊過滬破法商</h3>
<p>全隊迅速異常鄭季良尤佳</p>
<p>結果二對一比法商亦可觀</p>
<p>參加全運會之香港足球隊、昨乘過滬晋京之便、願與申江之著名西人球隊作一度周旋、乃約法商、會戰於中華棒球塲、戰期旣佈、觀者雲集、香港隊賴其清脆脚頭、活潑傳遞、得二對一結果、戰勝强頑之法商際、小試牛刀、果然迎刄而解、前途燦爛、當可預期、該隊已於昨晚乘十一時特别快車晋京、將來滬港粤三雄奪標時、必可動全國之聽聞也、</p>
<h3>鄭季良人才出衆</h3>
<p>連日陰雨、塲地濘滑、行走且不便、况乎奔馳、此跌彼倒、常事耳、不成泥人、安足示其勇武也、球員有善於乾地或濕地者、惟濕地較難見精、如兼而能之方爲全才、是則香港隊選手之能於立脚不隱之塲地、一如其往日之靈巧者、其實力之雄厚可知、全塲最引爲驚奇者乃左翼鄭季良技能出衆、人非高大、而肌力充實、且跳蹤如飛、盤挑齊能、故其行踪所趨、無怪采聲隨之耳　其他十人、各有專長、而而段敏捷、出脚迅速、幾乎人人皆同、敵方防守周密、不然、何致僅此些微之差别耳、</p>
<h3>派克氏表演特佳</h3>
<p>法商人才之衆、大堪驚人、西捕隊名將派克、亦被羅致於其幕下、甲組賽中、頗有雄視之勢、昨日派克居中樞要職内部遂牢如金城鐵壁、進攻不易、守門福禄壽亦頗盡職第　球之失手、在旣觸手指之後、復又碰門柱入網、不無大意之咎、第二球由於雙方短巷相接之際、守者不得已加入單團、遂使龍門大開、而致告陷、此則失其所誤耳、前鋒極爲精銳、但在對方嚴密監視之下、亦難自由行動、大體而言、法商隊誠覺可畏耳、</p>
<p>昨日抵滬之香港足球隊（徐天章攝）</p>
<h3>逢勁敵各一和局</h3>
<p>法商開球、來勢兇猛、中部三將、各顯神通、香港内衛森嚴、守門老練、卒化險爲夷、香港左翼鄭季良快如飛馬、一騎入陣、往往造成恐怖局面、要非派克主持中樞、大局不堪設想、進攻累試不利、改變策略、名聞全國之守門而調充中鋒之包家平、突二十五碼之間、猛然一脚、快人快事、居然人網、首開紀録、顧五分鐘之後、忽生奇變、香港旣占、優勢、内部亦進駐前方、内部空虛、右翼貝傑爾遂乘隙入侵、守門林天爘挺身而起、作困獸門、事與意違、亦告失守、上半時一對一和局、</p>
<h3>出全力二對一勝</h3>
<p>下半時香港右翼伍寳渠不負使命、一球盤至右陲、轉身挑中、梁達榮稍一躊躇、黄金機會、遂如秋風浙去、彼時香港氣勢之盛不可一世、五虎環門、相繼進撲、法商全軍調還、分佈要隘、十决十盪、天地變色、相持十五分鐘、形勢稍緩、鄭季　　爪哇華僑出席全運會網球代表右林續胤左許新荃　　（王開攝）</p>
<p>良左邊一脚、被入腹地、局面又見緊急、二三轉遞梁達榮迎門射人、二對一占先、法商由派充領率、幾番反攻、卒遭閉門羹、不利而退、包家平一度受傷、仍力疾作戰、觀衆鼓掌不已、黄順美勇武過人、衝鋒陷陣、一球攻門、福禄壽得而復失梁達榮追上射進祇以越位作廢、七十分鐘比賽終了、結果、香港二對一勝、</p>

<h3>國術全運國考評裁之異同金·一·明·</h3>
<p>二日首都某報所載、國術表演與考試之我見］一篇、鄙人原願名爲一國術比賽與考試不同之點］、爲該報主編該欄者、將題改爲［國術表演與考試之我見］、使人幾疑演而不比、比而不演、其去題旨與事實也、更遠矣、兹將全運與國考、略有異同之點、分别述之如下、</p>
<p>前閱褚張二公來往二函、對於國術比賽與考試主張之不同、余之看法、曾分爲甲乙二項、</p>
<p>甲項專爲比試設想</p>
<p>（一）搏擊對試（二）摔跤對試（三）散打對試</p>
<p>（四）同悈對試（五）異悈對試（六）徒手敵悈</p>
<p>乙項專爲表演設想如</p>
<p>（一）徒手表演（二）對手表演（三）徒手團體表演</p>
<p>（四）單械表演（五）對悈表演（六）器械團體表演</p>
<p>爲推進現代國術計張公主張不分宗派同來比試、以分勝負、故以濫竽一一面聽爲譬、是以考試細則中、甲項訂定居多、［乙項］略而從簡、所請注重在此而不在彼、</p>
<p>爲整齊現代國術計、褚公主張分門别類、同樣比賽、以分優劣、故以球類同樣比賽爲喻、是以句裏行間、［乙項］爲主、［甲項］不遑不顧及、亦所請注重在此而不在彼、</p>
<p>世人宜先明白二公之立場、一爲政治而兼軍事、一爲政治而兼敎育、主張雖略有輕重長短之分、而其提倡國術則一也、讀者若固執已見、謂請背道面馳、則未免泯没熱忱竭力提倡者之初衷、余之看法、以爲全運之比賽細則、不必與國考全同、國考之考試細則、亦未必與比賽全異、不過評判與裁判上略分輕重耳、現代之國術尙在整理及進行時期、究以何種敎材分别適用於學界或軍界者雖有其人其技、但尙無規定之明文、更雖編定輕久不更之條例、目下排用乙種表演式者、是以能同式拳械比賽者、評判優劣爲宜、兼可採用對試法以分勝負、適用［甲種］之對試法者、固宜集挾衆技之特特者、裁判勝負爲準、兼可用預試表演、以分優劣就事論事、重述鄙忱質之高明以爲如何、</p>

<h3>天才論的愛好者</h3>
<p>— 歐碧</p>
<p>一個天才的被發見終究是一棒比較不容易的事情··運氣好的還會被發見於生前，壞的，也許要被發見於死後，那末，這發見，天才本人就不會看到。要是那天才早就看到他自已是天才，只因爲没有人支發見他，便抱恨以終，那不是大悽慘？</p>
<p>所以要是你知道你自已是天才的話，你還是自已說出來的好；要是不好意思實說，你可應用什麽别的暗示。</p>
<p>比如，你可以說你始終是一個天才論的愛好者。</p>
<p>天才論的愛好者是什麽意思呢？大槪天才論是論天才的怎樣産生以及天才會有怎樣的作爲等等，而你是一個愛好這個論的人。你愛好它，同時你還漸漸地變成了它所論到的人中的一個。</p>
<p>比如，天才的産生是半由於遺傳，半由於敎育，而你的確知道你的父系很卓越，母系也很優秀，是很有産生一個天才的可能性。</p>
<p>至於敎育，不用說，你受的是最完備的敎育，完備得即使你自已不欲成爲一個天才也是不可能的。</p>
<p>而且你還憑吊過莎士比亞的墳墓，或者拜訪過但丁的故鄉。</p>
<p>於是，無疑地，你是一個天才了。</p>
<p>可是人家偏不領悟你是天才又怎麽辦呢？那，正如上面已說過了的，只有你自已來暗示。你寫了天才論的愛好者，再寫論遺傳與敎育之於天才，再寫天才辦，再寫天才······總之，你開口天才，下筆天才；你要那麽講，那麽寫，非講到寫到人家都相信你就是天才，天才就是你不止。</p>
<p>現在，就在别人的眼中，你不但是一個天才論的愛好者，你的確已是天才本身了。</p>
<h3>［庸人自擾之］</h3>
<p>— 追風</p>
<p>丨質錢歌川先生丨</p>
<p>早些日子有位李先生在自由談上發表了一篇［英語在歐洲並不通行］，對於基本英語的宣傳人錢歌川先生的一些無稽的話加以指責，隨後錢先生便在某報上揭出他的覆文［天下本無事］，對於李先生說的話究竟是否說對了一層，没有提及，倒是對於李先生的籍貫，作了一回很詳的研究，綜括那文的意思··李先生是台灣人，而台灣人對於錢先生所鼓吹的基本英語是無權置喙的。撇開一切人身攻擊的問題不談，單是那文章的邏輯已很夠人驚異了。而其中還責駡到台灣人没有骨氣，原文謂··［略謂他（鄭成功）雖一時佔領台灣，終不能保，數經亂戰之後，甲午必亡於異族。但距其時二百七十年後台灣有一志士出，而大下從此多事矣。我（錢川）當時覺得朝鮮爲其獨立運動志士輩出，台灣同受日人虐待，自鄭成功後竟無聞人，這恐怕只是鄭公的一片希望，不見得是可靠的預言。］云云。</p>
<p>看了這樣無緣無故侮辱台灣民衆的話，雖是對於基本英語運動不願問其是非的我，也不能不出來說幾句話了。</p>
<p>聽說錢先生在日本念過幾年書，對於日本的事情當然是很熟悉的，台灣自亦在内，所以錢先生能明明白白斷定··［自鄭成功以後竟無聞人］。不過也許因爲基本英語有高師的東洋先生做靠山，而台灣史則找不出肯說實話的東洋生先，所以錢先生不得不憑一已的聰明來獨斷罷？我現在不願和錢先生說空話，祇指給錢先生一點史實，如果錢先生有懷疑的地方，那麽請到東京日比谷圖書館翻翻幾本中日戰記就行了。</p>
<p>清政府割台灣給日人時，台灣民衆舉唐量崧爲大統領，劉永福爲副大統領，組織台灣共和國，與日人抗爭。以蕞爾小島，二百七十餘萬民衆，抗拒世界新與的國家，殺死近衞團長北白川宫能久親王，使倭人心寒，向北京政府交涉，謂台人反抗，日本不能接受台灣，如清廷不管束台人，則進犯京師。李鴻章嚇得魂不附體，便使清帝電命唐劃云··［台抗京危，束裝返國］。清室爲欲保全其社稷，竟將台灣送與日人。但唐劉夜逃後，台人仍自結隊抗日，李經芳竟不能登岸點交。這段充滿着血與淚的悲壯的史實，我們的博學的錢先生竟可以一筆抺消嗎？此外，再請我們的錢先生看着甲午以後的史實罷··</p>
<p>一八九五年　（林大北案）　一八九六年　（劉德杓案）</p>
<p>一八九八年　（陳發案）　　一九○一年　（詹阿瑞案）</p>
<p>一九○七年　（蔡清淋案）　一九一二年　（劉　乾案）</p>
<p>一九一二年　（黄　朝案）　一九一二年　（陳阿要案）</p>
<p>一九一二年　（羅福星案）　一九一三年　（張火爐案）</p>
<p>一九一三年　（李阿齊案）　一九一三年　（賴　來案）</p>
<p>一九一四年　（羅阿頭案）　一九一五年　（余清芳案）</p>
<p>據日法院統計，自一八九五年起，至一九○六年止，爲獨立運動經法院處死刑者已達三千五百十八人，陣亡及憲兵所殺者不計。單就余清芳案而論，被處死刑者達八百六十六人。（燒殺婦孺不計）自一九二一年至一九三三年九月底止，因獨立運動而下獄者不知多少。對着這樣慘烈的犧牲，和台灣人有着同一的祖先的錢歌川先生，還敢再說··自鄭成功後竟無聞人嗎？照錢歌川先生這樣說，那麽，四十年後，中華書局可以再請錢先生編一部滿洲國記，說是東四省自被日人侵占後，竟無聞人，而將馬占山，丁超，李杜和許許多多的義勇軍的抗日戰史一律抺消啦！這也許是錢先生認爲最有光榮的一大事業吧！末了，我還得請敎錢先生幾樣事情··</p>
<p>（一）台灣人以前是不是中國人？錢歌川先生憑着什麽資格欺笑一時受着異族踴躪的同胞？</p>
<p>（二）爲什在台灣住過的人没有資格批評基本英語？而在東京小石川住過的却有資格介紹？</p>
<h3>黄庭堅與江西詩派</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>黄庭堅作詞不嫌鄙俗，作詩却歡喜用拗句僻典。他的詞不避筆墨勸淫之譏，敎人作詩却說讀經學道。他也和歐陽修一樣，似乎在兩種文學形式裏表現了兩種人格。只是他的詩給後來詩人的影響最大。</p>
<p>南渡之初，呂居仁自以爲得黄庭堅陳師道的衣鉢，作江西宗派圖。列黄陳而下，謝逸謝邁韓駒李彭晁沖之等凡二十五人，號爲江西詩派。元人方回在灜奎律髓裏稱杜甫爲一祖，黄堅庭陳師道陳與義爲三宗，江西詩派更確定了。</p>
<p>不過我的意見，與其說黄庭堅的詩學杜甫，毋寗說他學韓愈，他的父親（黄庶就是作詩學韓愈的。他自已也不諱言學韓，雖然同時他還說到學杜。我以爲韓愈的詩生硬僻澀，是由八代直到盛唐，五七言詩都已達到爛熟而起的一種反動。宋朝詩人除了可以利用詞體作爲新的一種詩體而外，要做詩，總跳不過唐人範圍。要避免唐人爛熟的一條舊路，只好揀生硬的一條路來走。這雖然也是韓愈一派人走過的一條路，究竟没有幾個算得走上了路的成功作家，無異乎還是一條新路。黄庭堅正是把握了這個趨勢而爬上了成功之路的第一個新作家。陳師道跟著黄庭堅走，也算爬上了成功之路。從此要走這生硬一條路的詩人，數典忘祖，只得就近推黄陳做初祖。恰好黄陳都生在江西，就號爲江西詩派了。</p>
<h3>橄浦通信（二）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>○○兄··</p>
<p>如果你要來澉浦看看鹽區，你是必須經遏澉浦城的。所以，在說到鹽區生活之先，對於澉浦鎭是必須有一番交代。就因爲這個原故，在下鄉之前，我在城裏住宿了一天。在上海，當一二八之前，有朋友來玩的時候，我總是勸他去吳淞鎭或者是竇山，去看看那明代的古屋，去看看那些古俠們如何的能飛牆走壁，而今俠祇能望着法界的十三層樓，跑馬廳的二十二層樓而歡氣。以後再有朋友來，我却不想這樣講了，如若他們圓適，我想要他們到澉浦來看看，因爲這兒有比日本帝國主義在上海砲火毁了的古屋更老的房宇，有上海已　看不到的會持桿高跳的人總會跳過來的古城垣，有那典型的古街道，比兆豐公園更古大的鐘，有秦始皇，始皇妃，孫權，王陽明，吳麟徵，和許多仙仙俠俠的遺跡，雖然也不少較近代的建築，以及大次牌美麗牌的香烟。</p>
<p>這個海鹽縣屬的市鎭，［三民主義］所說的東方大港，確是有許多特徵存在着的，其他古城共同具有的一些特徵。這個城鎭面積約一萬畝，離海鹽一六·八八公里。人口總數是三萬四千二百二十一人，男一七七五一，女一六四七○。生活在城裏的，不過六七千人。人民大部分是鹽民。出産，鹽而外，有夏布（祇能做帳的粗夏布），梅桃李筍。米，每年可産七萬担，茶産一百担。在城裏調查的結果，有幾點是令我特加驚異的。第一，就是全區有廟宇四十所，完全小學祇有一個，中學没有，初級及代用的小學據說有十三所，而機關是十個。比例的看，這地方是有二多的，一是謿宇多，二是機關多。第二，深多遺憾的，是人民的政治信仰甚薄，據政治機關統計，一張表上載的，全區祇有國民黨員五人，另一張却是九男二女十一人。就以後者計，也是三千一百十一人之中有一國民黨員。第三，就是據調查表，已婚的男七四二六，女七三五五，未婚的男八九一八，女六五一○，　寡男一四○七，女二六○五，離婚的根本根有。看了這樣數目字，你究竟作如何的感想呢？</p>
<p>特殊的說說敎育吧。在城裡，學校一共是三的，城南小學，海門小學，和澉浦小學。三校學生，一共二百多人，敎師共六七入，内女敎師一人，女生數十人。這三校，祇城南是兩級，而設備也祇有這裏最完備，建築設備，不亞於上海的公立小學。敎育程度，據統計，學齡兒童就學的，男一一五○，女一一七，學齡兒童失學的男一七五七，女二二四五，十三歲以上不識字的男八八○七，女一一六九三。初小畢業，在私塾讀過五年以上的，男三二七。八女九三，中學以上畢業的，男二四，女一。看了這裏所列的數目字，敎育家門又將作何感想呢？而垷這個數目字還不一定確實。</p>
<p>這裏的市面不大，大小让舖不過百餘家，最大的祇有一家洋貨舖，每年有一二萬元的生意，其他都很小。雖然是在滬松公路的旁邊，一切的情形和交通不便的内地市鎭，是多少有些彷彿的。到處烏雅一樣黑，在這裏調查的結果，封建勢力的壓迫一樣的雄厚，小民一樣的呌苦連天。一天的城中生活，最剌激我們的可說有二點，一是豪紳的包車一路籌叮噹，二是官吏的轎子在街上横衝直撞。不識相的我們，在晚間，竟和一個什麽委的轎夫衝突起來，在澉浦的人民看來，我們的舉動，已經是反了天，若不是佔了上海人的威勢，是非吃生活不可的。然而，我們衝突的，還是什麽委的轎夫。○○兄，這就是我要給你介紹的澉捕岬。阿英八月十六日</p>

<p>她像是並没有注意到她所以誘引安利。戴洛姆到這里來的眞實的理由。在數秒之間，安利，戴洛姆一面在這個女兒身上傾注着他那難以抑制的食慾，一面就站着把他的一隻手放在她的肩上，仔細地觀賞着她，預先嘗着滋味了。可是她露出像什麽都不曉得似的樣子。</p>
<p>據她說，當她在姆蘭市工作的時候，她是有一個更美麗的廚房的。在那里，她是作着法官魯東杜先生家裏的侍女。那間廚房不像現在是磚舖的地，而是用木細工作成的。如果不怕傷風的話，就是光着脚走在上邊都不汚濁。那房子是很講究的，因爲死掉太太，她才辭事不作了。太太病了很久，是腸胃顛倒的病，一吃東西，馬上就落到肚子裡頭去了。因此，没有方法消化。太太是西班牙的美人。</p>
<p>的確的，女人是不像男人；女人不像男人那麽小心眼兒。丨安利·戴洛姆這樣想了。但是在女人的身體裡，是裝了什麽東西，她才這樣地好講話呢？好像在女人們的身體裡是塡充着滿滿的話語，非要吐出來不可似的。什麽魯東杜先生啦，什麽魯東杜夫人啦，什麽死啦，什麽廚房啦，這些話說不說又有什麽關係呢！然而，瑪麗就是這麽繼續不斷地說着。</p>
<p>在姆蘭市的時候，她認識了貝爾特。這個貝爾特，現在在佛瓦爾牧師家裡作着侍女。當時，她們是同住在一條街上·她們還有一個名奥爾坦絲的朋友，她是很老實很好的女兒。就是後來，奥爾坦絲也時常寄給她們兩個盡信片。可是瑪麗發見到，送給貝爾特的　片，總是有光的，而送給自已的，是没有光的，自從發見了這個事實，她就再也不給她回信。</p>
<p>安利，戴洛姆忍耐着聽她講這畫片的事。因爲他的食慾是過份地激動了。所以無論怎樣無味的話，一裝進他的頭裏來，就像落在熱石頭上的水滴似地，發也淡淡的蒸氣·馬上消失了。在這種時候，他是能很快活地咬着，咀嚼着·吃着·而且吞了瑪麗的吧·如果在她的腸子裡還藏着拉丁語的話，那也將一起被消化了的吧。</p>
<p>他用一隻手，在這個女兒的上衣和脖子的皮膚之間，摸滑着。她的肉體的温度眞是使人舒服·那好像在節下吃的肉食似的。肉也吧·女兒也吧，如果不趕快吃了的話·就要冷了。</p>
<p>這種事她也曉得了麽？她說道··</p>
<p>丨丨我怎麽這樣好講話？我再不趕快弄，就要晚了。晚餐的馬鈴薯的皮還要剥呢！</p>
<p>她走到椅子那邊去，一坐下便剥起來了。他也隨着走過去。安利的手是從前面滑下去的，現在又從後面滑上來了。她剥着馬鈴要的皮。她的背和胸是同樣地温暖。但是對於安利，她像是冰冷而且不安似的。他用手掌按住了她，像盡力不使她的温嗟變令了。就是這樣，他還想對着她講··</p>

<h3>過去之金融業及今後之動向王·雨·桐·</h3>
<p>吾人欲覘社會經濟之安定與否，必先覘金融業之組織是否健全爲斷，良以金融事業，爲社會經濟之原動力，社會之一切經濟需求，胥取給於是。我國之金融機關，嚮以票號與錢莊稱巨寗，自有新式銀行以後，金融重心，遂漸移集於銀行，至是人之稱金融界者，皆以銀行爲代表。惟是近年以政局不寗，國家財政，入不敷出，捐稅繁重，社會經濟，已早呈日暮途窮之勢。乃民國二十年入秋以後，沿江各省，水害頻仍，舉國方喘息於空前之天災疫癘之苦，不意曾幾何時，九一八瀋變突發，敵人乘我之危，益復肆意侵略，翌年滬戰亦接踵以起。其時外有强敵壓境，内則鄂贛赤匪騷擾。變禍之多，可謂爲民國以來所僅有。而影響所及，對於社會經濟，打擊尤大，百業停滯，金融方面，首見銀根奇緊，證劵狂落，一時金融機關，皆如處狂風怒濤之孤舟中，摇撼震駭，驚心萬狀。幸金融界尚能早爲綢繆，東北告驚以後，卽互相戒備，勉力維持。旋於一二八事態正急之際，更採共同合作方法，使票據彼此滙劃通用，竭力節省現幣之支付，一方以春節總結帳期適屆，乃公議展緩，同時對於外國銀行，不通漚劃，外國銀行亦表示不乘機收受存欵，於是當前之金融狀况，乃賴以轉穩。旋復有銀行聯合準備庫之組織。錢業方面，亦有財産特别保管委員會之設立。凡此雖皆屬臨時倉卒之設計；要亦可窺見金融界在國難期中，應付環境之苦心也。</p>
<p>今者東北四省！相繼淪陷，國難日深，金融業爲總握一切經濟活動事業，吾人自國家立塲上言之，此後應若何合力共圖金融，事業之安定，扶助社會經濟之發展與穩固，俾减政府内顧之憂，此徵之歐戰時，各國皆已有先例，昭示吾人。惟揆之我國過去時期，金融業對於社會之所貢獻者，除一二有心，且復格於情勢，不易表顯，與社會共見者外，餘子碌碌，吾人實未敢妄進阿諛之詞。就吾人所知，歷年來金融業之發展，均不出於下列之畸形途徑。</p>
<p>（一）公債之投機　近年我國之金融業，以國内之絲茶失敗，及農作歉收，及近年之輪入農産品，侵奪銷路，致所謂金融季節，自民國二十年以後，已早失常，爲之紊亂無餘。如十九年十一月，銀元自上海輸出者，僅二百四十九萬元。二十年五月，僅一百六十萬元。二十一年五月，由輸出轉爲進口九百二十七萬元，此由於我國農村經濟，雖瀕破産，而外貨仍不絶傾銷於内地之故。據最近之調查，上海一埠，所集中之現金數，佔全國流通資金二分之一以上。於是此巨量現金均積滯於都市之金融機關；去路旣阻，遂羣集於公債庫劵之投機經營。總計自民國十六年至二十年，五年之間一政府董行債劵至二十六種之多，發行額之總數，爲十萬零一千二百萬元。以各年份言之，計十六年之發行數，爲七千六百零九萬零七十四元；十七年爲一萬零三百萬元；十八年爲二萬四千三百萬元；十九年爲一萬七千四百萬元；二十年爲四萬一千六百萬元；及本年春間，又發行愛國庫劵一種，計二千萬元；最近又有一萬萬元二十二年關稅庫劵之發行。顧債劵之發行額雖巨，然迄今市價高漲，市塲猶　籌碼缺乏之苦。試以最近之市價，較之一二八滬變前後之市價，相差直不可以道里計。例如一二八發生以前之民國廿一年一月五日，上海債劵市價指數，爲五七·九九；又一月廿五日，爲五一·五七；而最近如本年七月十七日之指數，爲九一·二七，雖云其間有滬戰前後之關係，然相差究屬過巨。此種現象，在今日農村經濟，已瀕危境，都市工商，亦相繼絶滅之我國經濟社會中，實最可危懼。蓋一國之經濟，其發達途徑，恒顯示平均之程度，决無有農工商各業，皆趨衰枮，而金融一業，獨見繁榮之理也。</p>
<p>（二）地産事業之熱中　在過去之數年間上海金融業之熱中於地産事業，殆爲無可諱言之事實。據普益公司發表，自民國十五年至十九年之五年内，上海地産價值之增加，爲二十萬萬兩。一九三○年一年所增，占其半數。同時上海各地産公司股票紅利之增進，亦可知地産事業之發達。如上海英法地産公司股息紅利，民國十六年爲百分之九，民國二十年，增爲百分之十二。普益地産公司，民國十六年，爲百分之七，民國二十年，增至百分之十五。又據上海地産月刋之交易統計；民國十九年之交易總額，爲六千五百萬元，而廿年增爲一萬三千一百萬元。一般外商，因銀價低落，無從滙寄國外，而卽以之投資於地産。更以年來兵匪爲患，戰亂頻仍，内地人民，不得安居，富有者均挾資遷避來滬，於是都市之游資，益形充斥，乃羣於投機標金公債外，復趨於地産買賣。金融機關，更吸收他方面之資金，以投諸地産事業。民國十九年度，爲上海地産事業最稱繁盛之時期。其發達之程度，爲歷年所僅見。地價之增漲，房屋之添造，與夫成交數目之巨大，可謂爲未曾有。上述民國十五年至十九年五年内，上海房地産價值總額，所增加之二十萬萬兩中，十九年一年所增，卽已佔其半數，可謂盛矣。惟地産事業之正當發達，亦須與本國之工商業，保其均衡之勢，必無偏枯畸形進展者也。</p>
<p>處農村經濟破産，工商業衰落之今日，内地資金，旣失留戀迴旋之餘地，於是皆匯集都市，竭全國之財力精華，以造成大都市虛浮之繁榮。譬諸大厦，樑練已傾圯，猶欲粉飾外表，圖壯觀瞻，此實自絶之道也。今幸金融業於麗經驚　駭浪，創巨痛深之餘，乃悟已往種種之非，皆有努力改赴正途之表示，此誠我金融界一綫曙光之所由生。不佞以爲今後金融，果具改革之决心者，則應明乎本身之病態，先從鞏固本身之基礎入手。第一，我國之銀行賣本，普通自二十五萬元，以至數百萬元，最大者中國銀行，爲二千四百七十餘萬元，中央銀行爲二千萬元，實力旣小，一旦遇有國中之大規模投資事業，苟一案獨攬，則力有未逮，欲聯合同業，則復格於情勢，有所不能，結果往往爲洋商捷足攫去。且小資本之銀行，在平日勉力圖存，已感竭蹶之苦，設不幸一旦風潮襲來，則未有不相繼倒閉者，此時於銀行之本身關係猶小，而因此推波助潤，摇惑人心，益足增深恐慌之程度，影響於整個之社會經濟者實大。故爲今之計，應由政府嚴令各小銀行，就旨趣或營業相同者，實行合併，俾集中力量，以樹其自立之基。按銀行之合併，在歐美日本，皆爲習見之事例。第二，銀行應各自確定營業方針，各覓資金之出路，我國金融業目下之最大弊病，卽在爭相模信效尤，因以爭利，年來如銀行之以兼辦儲蓄或信託業務，而博得信譽，或獲致盈利者，則其他銀行，亦羣起紛設儲蓄信託部份，公債地産之因利厚，而引起各銀行之爭相投資，結果徒造成公債地産不合理之漲價；凡此皆爲國人創辦企業所最易招致之病態。昔年之信交風潮，亦何莫由於此類心理所造成者乎？且也資金苟不爲合理之運用，則銀行將失其調劑社會經濟，與暢通全國金融之職能，爲害將不可勝言，此猶臂譬之水流，彼江河之水，苟積滯一隅，不謀宣洩，則汜濫潰决，而不以爲治。必也善爲疏導，俾暢其流；以利農田物産。第三，我國之銀行，自外部觀之，未始非一最新式之金融機關。顧細察其内容；或則組織不健全，粗漏簡單，或則事務不求效率，當局者對於服務人員，臺意希冀以最小之報酬，獲得最大之效果，結果徒使服務人員，日惟徬徨於生活之條件下，工作苟且敷衍，人人懷求去之念，此足使銀行之本身，終日在摇摇不定之處境中。復有組織完備，當局者亦賢睿可法，顧一切事務不得其人而治，此亦足爲銀行前途發展之阻滯。第四，特殊銀行與分業銀行，應使之名實相符。特殊銀行中，如中央銀行之爲國家銀行，中國銀行之爲國際滙兌銀行；交通銀行之爲發展全國實業銀行；固各有其所負之特殊任務，其他分業銀行之如興業·實業·墾業·綢業·監業·實未嘗切實從事其特殊之業務。所達營者，均爲一般之普通商業銀行業務，絶未與其所標示之事業，有若何關聯。馴至今日之銀行；徒知標新炫異以立名，而未有力圖振刷，以另闢新途徑者。</p>
<p>以上各項祗爲個人就數年來服務金融界，感想所及，舉其犖犖大者，願與有心人士共研討之。</p>
<h3>我國信託事業之前途</h3>
<p>朱·斯·煌·</p>
<p>我國信託事業，起源於民國十年，近年以來，日見發達，然與歐美相較，尙覺望塵莫及。國内信託業務之最通行者，莫如信託投資，不動産代理事項，證劵代理事項，保管堆棧，指導等類。至執行遺囑信託，管理遺産信託，監護信託，生前信託，發行公司債信託等，亦有曾經舉曾者，然尙在提倡之中。而一般信託公司，兼辦銀行保險業務，反見銀業之發達，遠過信託本業，彼銀行中之信託部，其主體本爲銀業，固無論矣。然則我國信託事業，所以不能如歐美之發達者，厥故安在？其最大原因，則以中外社會經濟狀况之不同。我國工商落後，經濟幼稚，無可諱言，信託事件之稀少，亦意中事耳。且他代管財産，執行遺囑，每苦我國人民，喜守秘密，而遺産處分，無歐美各國之種種法律手續。又如就團體信託而言，公司組織，本未發達，股票流行，用是稀少，而公司債票，則尤罕見於市塲。蓋外國工商發達，規模宏大，集資募股，靡遠弗屆，買賣轉讓，尤費手續。而信託公司初則代負募股之責，繼復分任過户註册之勞。終至舉債稱貸，動輒百萬千萬，非一二家銀行所能貸付，則由信託公司以公債之方式，銷售於市塲，如政府之發行公債然。及債票已分散於市塲，持有債劵者不能管理其債票之担保財産，而信託公司。又起而任其勞，此卽信託公司辦理公司創立，代理股劵過户註册，辦理發行公司債，及代理一切公司財務事項等團體信託業務之由來也。若論我國，工商業尙在萌芽，小本經營，尤多合夥組織，集資募欵，多限戚友。間有公司股票，買賣移轉，交易不繁，平日舉債，敷額亦小，銀行不難獨家應付。或有　債　較鉅至數萬數十萬者。銀行一家不能應付，連絡他行，共同出借，世所謂轉放欵項，然究無外國公司債欵之鉅，非以公債方式，不便募集。且我國商店，招股募債，喜守秘密，深慮外界聞知，有損名譽，安肯如外國之假手他人，公然勸募。因之此種團體信託事務，亦無振興之機。更就信託投資一項而言之，投資之要，貴有三種原則，（一）本金穩固；（二）利益豐富；（三）買賣便利··能合乎此，始爲最高尙之投資。我國最</p>
<p>普遍之投資品中，如公債一種，以折扣關係，利益誠豐富矣，有交易所專營公債。買賣亦便利矣，而價格高低，隨時局而變動，際此内憂外患，風雨飄摇之秋，債市不定，可想而知，於是最重要之第一原則，殊難適合，焉得視爲最良之投資。至論地産，在歐美各國，素爲投資利器，蓋其國工商進步，人口目繁，地價上漲，經濟之發達使然，絶無暴漲暴落之虞，故本金甚爲穩固。又以市塲利率，低在二三厘左右，而地産收益，恒在五六厘之間，世以借資而經營地産者，還本付息而有餘，利益不爲不豐，於是經營者多。我國地産狀况，表面雖亦發達。論其實際，年來上海地價增高，果有經濟之發達爲其基礎乎？大槪以内地擾攘，農村破産，避難來滬與夫入市謀生者，日見其多，内地游資，亦遂集中於都市。一時人口增多，游資又乏正當用途，於是非公債卽地産，如此推波助濔，地價日漲。然都市經濟，與農村互爲表裏，農村如此，亦難久保其畸形之發達。九一八慘案以來，公債價格，一落千丈。一二八滬戰以後，地産市面，大非昔觀。自内債邇盤整理，債市漸有轉機，面地産業之呆滯如故也。　　　　他産，寗一海市發樓，此擬或有過當，然非全無眞理也。加以市塲利率，高者一分有餘，平均亦常在七厘左右。而地産收益，僅在五六厘之間，若於地産爲眞正之投資，更難得豐富之利益。於是投機買賣，羣趨若狂，以是起家者固不乏人，而不幸傾家蕩産卒以身殉者，亦不罕觀。總之中國之所缺乏者，爲農工商業眞正之投資。爭以公債地産，投機買賣，爲維一生利之方法，豈重謂爲正當投資乎？旣鮮正當投資之工具，信託投資，發展自見不易。　一方固因環境所迫，無可如何；面一方金融工商各界領袖，實少有力之提倡。雖一二種健之銀行及信託公司辦理信託投資，煞費苦心。然社會經濟，長此以往，不特信託業務，難於振興，且足爲全國金融業憂，亦足爲全國經濟前途憂也。</p>
<p>爲今日擴展信託業務計，惟有一面勸導社會，使明瞭信託眞諦，一面自立新猷，爲金融界另團途徑。萬不能隨波逐流，因循生誤。夫製造家之創製新品也，必先着手廣告與宣傳，使人民養成購用新品之嗜好，而後新製産品，始得暢銷。當今我國信託事業，正在萌芽，無異於新創物品。雖非必爲廣告式之宣傳，要當閘明信託眞諦，使人民知信託爲何物，並養成其信託習慣。外國銀行常有發行書籍，分贈各界，内容專叙時事或某種經濟問題，全書中僅註明某銀行出版外，絶無一字自爲矜炫，其贈書目的，一在連絡感情，一在說明問題，著作所播，大足見效於無形。如此作非廣告式之宣傳，其目標高遠，誠屬超人一等，宣傳之外，更不可不於營業上另闢新途，一則奠擴展業務之基礎，一則堅社會眞誠之信仰。按我國信託公司，辦理公司創立，代理股劵過户註册，辦理發行公司債，代理一切公司財務事項等團體信託業務，及辦理信託投資之困難情形，已如上述，兹欲破除困難，厥惟助惟進工商實業正當之投資，庶與信託業務之進展，互相裨益。其道雖多端，而提倡承受公司股票債劵，爲最效之方。卽一新創公司，欲發股劵債票，由信託公司承購一定數量，再行銷售市面。能全數銷脫，則信託公司不自保留，否則由信託公司，自留一部。如信託公司預先承購之價低於分銷之價，則信託公司可以獲利，否則虧損，故信託公司欲爲是類業務，必先預計異日該項股票債劵之銷路，欲增進銷路，不得不有買賣推銷之機關。我國公債庫劵，有交易所爲買賣之機關，而於公司股票債劵之交易，在交易所偶一成交，微不足道，反不如在華外國公司之股票債劵，有洋商經營之衆業公所，交易頻每也，是以我國尙少一眞正之證劵市塲，爲各種公司股票債劵交易之中心。此則金全賴金融業家登高一呼鼎力提倡。近年以來，頗有數大銀行，提倡商業票據市塲者。而證劵市塲，亦見同等重要。蓋前者調劑流動資本，故又名金融市塲。後者調劑固定資本，故又名資本市場。旣有市塲，則推銷自易，且所發行之股票債劵，經信託公司之精密考慮而承受者，必爲上品。一俟先爲承受，假以著名信託公司之信用，聲價益增百倍，推銷更覺不難。工商界藉信託公司之扶助得以繁榮滋長，良好之股票債劵，自可增多。於是信託公司之承受業務，因之愈得發展，而社會資金，亦得流入正當投資之途。買賣轉讓，在在尤需信託公司之代理。故信託公司僅提倡證劵市場及承受業務，已盡辦理公司創立及發行公司債信託之能事，並得連帶擴展其他信託業務，如代理股劵過户註册，代理一切公司財務事項及信託投資等事務，誠一舉而數得也。然此不過舉其一端而言也。信託業家之所應勸導提倡並與他種團體切實合作者，猶千端萬緒，萬事必須放遠眼光，不可斤斤較量於目前之利益。如是循序漸進，自强不息，更能内政清明，時局安定，信託前途，豈有涯涘哉！</p>
<h3>本埠支行設立問題的研究</h3>
<p>初·</p>
<p>邇來上海銀行界，在本埠設立支行，絶爲踴躍，南京路靜安寺路八仙橋北四川路南市等處，都有各銀行之支行設立其間。窮嘗夷考其設立之理由，不外乎下列數端。</p>
<p>（一）存欵之吸收也　存欵者，銀行之生命線也。故吸收存欵，實爲延續銀行生命之唯一方法。挾巨額之存欵，以臨金融社會，自能周轉裕如，左右逢源，而無捉襟見肘，窘態畢露之虞。今據民國二十年度各銀行之營業報告觀之，中交及上海等銀行之存欵，爲數較多，而該數行者，本埠支行，亦較其他各銀行爲多也。　　（二）儲蓄業務之推廣　儲蓄存欵之性質，異於其他商業往來之存欵。商店金融之調劑，必需經銀行（或其他金融機關）之手，爲之周轉其問，始見收便利之效，則商店必有賴於銀行也。惟儲蓄存欵之性質，初不如是，儲户往來，亳無商業之性質，可存可不存，無大關係。儲户存欵之决定，半視銀行之服務，是否便利爲轉移。故銀行之經營儲蓄業務，類多遷就顧客，旣提高存欵之利率，復鞏固其保障，以廣招徠，而儲蓄顧客，多爲零星小户，散居各地，一行之設，不足以包攬無遺，則競設本埠支行，各就其區域之内，力事推廣，吸收存欵，聚腑成裘，積沙成塔，儲蓄業務之推廣，實有賴於本埠支行之設立。試觀民國二十年度，各行之儲蓄存欵，舍四行儲蓄會外，以上海商業儲蓄銀行爲較多，而該行本埠支行之設立，共有六處之多也。</p>
<p>（三）同業之競爭　同業競爭，相沿成習，賢明如今日之銀行家，亦雖倖免。甲設支行於某地，乙丙繼之，不旋踵間，而支行林立，力事競爭；此上海本埠支行設立之多，而造成幾個銀行集中地之一部份理由也。</p>
<p>總之，本埠支行之設立，其唯一之目的，在於推廣銀行本身之業務，吸收存欵，服務社會，調劑本埠之金融，意至善也。然以本埠近日之商業而言，市况凋蔽，景象慘淡，殊無若干銀行爲之服務之必要，以英法兩租界及南北南市之總分支行計之，數約及百。總行與總管理處，另負有指揮全國分支行之職務，固無論矣，而本埠各支行，則莫不顧客寥落，事業清閒。夫一支行之設立，自經理以下之職員，至少五人至七人，其房租薪金開消等費用，月非數千金不辦。其唯一之業務，則爲吸收存欵，而押放欵之經營，律需秉總行之命，弗得自由，存欵之利息坐貼，開銷徒耗，所得殊不足以償所失。卽以吸收存欵之業務而言，亦殊有不可解者。當此之時，經濟凋蔽，商業呆滯，農村金融，至感枯竭，而都市金融，反形膨脹，蓋各地游資，　集滬埠，漸漸流入銀行之庫房，而銀行之有欵，遂月以增加聞矣。同時農村之不景氣，亦未有甚於今日者，救濟之呼聲，早已傳遍朝野，銀行負調劑金融之資，義無容辭，廣事救濟。而見諸實行者，舍中國銀行於定縣設立支行外，殆不多觀。然本埠支行之設立，於本埠金融之調劑，補助極少。而於銀行本身，爲益亦尠。則曷弗移其設立本埠支行之費用，移作設立農村支行之用，庶農村金融，得以調劑，而銀行本身，亦可得一新事業之經營，存欵得一運用之出路，是誠一舉而兩得其利也。</p>
<p>對於上海銀行舉辦</p>
<h3>農村運銷合作社的幾點貢獻</h3>
<p>高·矜·細·</p>
<p>自輪軌交通，五洲互市，中國數千年來自給自足之局面，爲之丕變。至今日農民已不能僅恃其土壞爲生存之要素，抑且有賴於市塲情形之變化；以爲其生活安定與否之判斷。若農民味於市塲情形，一遇農産品過剩與滯銷時，則農民終歲胼手胝足餐風宿露辛苦經營之結果，將無從取得報酬；甚至展轉而犧牲其生産時之資金，復加以經紀人從中剥削，而其損失愈將不貲。往歲榖賤傷農之事實，卽其明證，至今農民之創痛甚深，農村之元氣頗難恢復，誠足爲吾人良好之敎訓也。</p>
<p>上海銀行有鑒及此，爲减輕農民此種痛苦，爲穩定農村經濟，有舉辦農村運銷合作社訉，（十月二日本報華東社消息），刻尙在初步試行，容明年股東會議通過，再作正式實行之計，其與我農民以幸福者實大，此固我農民之所日夕祈望者也。</p>
<p>農村運輸合作社之意義，卽在根據於不取盈利之原則，謀農産品之有組織的運銷，使各個農民均能普遍獲得利益是也。論其具體的效用，則在第一點可以改進生産者論價之地位，第二點可以使消費者所出大部份金錢，均入生産者之手，第三點可以保證繼續供給及有規則的貿易，總此三者，可以使農民的浮耗可以减少，農民的富力可以增進，凡此言合作事業者莫不知之。今上海銀行舉辦農村運銷合作社，其果能使我農民可以安心從事地利，以貿易全權委託於該社執當乎？其果能增進農民富力以謀我農村經濟之穩定乎？其果能减少全部份或大部份之浮耗以改善現行分配制度乎？我將於此覘之矣。</p>
<p>惟世界上運輸合作社之失敗者極多，運銷合作社之經營自有其事實上之困難，縱使運輸合作之理論絶爲健全；然其不能補救事實上之困難處亦正多。今特提出數點與上海銀行共同商榷解决之，兼以告有志於運銷合作之同志，甚願共同注意及之也。</p>
<p>（一）辦理農村運銷合作社者有商業經騐與否？　　　　欲使運輸合作事業之發達，必須辦理該社　　事業者有充分商業經騐，對於市價之漲落，與夫各地之需要情形，均須瞭若指掌。今上海銀行運輸合作社之經理人選，是否在行中任意指出一人，商業經騐是否充足？眼光是否遠大？對於市價之漲落，是否能在事先略有把握？對於商業地理是否能熟悉？對於各地任何農産品之需要，能否大略明瞭并有使其擴大之能力？凡此種種，均宜於人選時，加以攷察。且也該社之目的，在代替經紀人之職務而消滅經紀人的利潤，其間自不免引起經紀人之忌嫉與競爭，經理該社，能否將運輸事業發達到相當可靠程度，以産生售賣機關，以擴充營業，非富有商業經騐者，曷克勝其任而愉快乎？此上海銀行之於選擇該社經理時之宜注意者一也。</p>
<p>（二）社員的忠實與否？　　社員之忠實與否，亦爲運輸合作社成敗之樞鈕。運銷合作社刻刻在與經紀人相奮鬥之中，若社員不忠實，對於該社不能抱有共同的信仰與犧牲的决心，則易受經紀人之高價的誘惑，便可戰獨售賣，結果將使全社蒙其害而至解散者數見不鮮。且中國農民之眼光短淺，團體精神尤爲缺乏，尤易受經紀人挑撥離間之愚弄，採取單獨行動，獲得較好價格，與經紀人私相授受，一個社員退出合作社，則每單位的貿易量减少，兩個社員退出合作社，則每單位之貿易量更少，其於運銷合作事業之打擊，至爲嚴重也。上海銀行將用何道以獲取社員之信仰乎？將用若何精密嚴格之方式以訓練社員之行動乎？此又宜注意者二也。</p>
<p>（三）運輸合作有否中心事業？　　上海銀行運輸合作社是否已有一種中心事業，爲其活動之目標？若能以一種農産品爲根據，則集合農産品於當地運輸之中心，定標準，分等級，加裝包，運輸及發送，囤積及制造，管理，記賬等手續，自可以一律辦理，較爲簡捷。中國之農産品之可以爲運銷的中心事業者，有棉花，茶葉，絲蠶等，若枝枝節節以某地特殊之農産品爲中心事業，又須考慮如何節省手續上的繁雜，以較合於經濟有效之原則，此又宜注意者三也。</p>
<p>上述三者，特其榮榮大者，以爲上海銀行進其區區的愚忱，初無非難之意。不佞對於上海銀行之期望甚切，對於運銷合作事業之希望亦甚大。深望上海銀行辦理該種事業之結果，十分良好，轉以引起其他金融機關之倣傚。故願就管見所慮，陳述其困難之點，以爲實施時之參考也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>我們需要經騐的興趣的敎師</h3>
<p></p>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>一天的忙碌的工作，到了黄昏時份，似乎担子輕鬆了一大半，可是整個身子已經是疲乏得夠飽了。但爲了求智慾的衝動，所以管不得一切，拚了最後一些兒的精力，去求滿足自已的慾望。於是每天午後七點鐘，我放棄了休息和其他一切零碎的任務，而把這疲乏得只尙能動彈的身子拖進了自已以爲滿意的XX補習夜校裏去。</p>
<p>以前，我因爲感覺到死讀書活的刻板乏味，想調劑一下這乏味的生活，所以才毅然離開學校，走上了社會的征途；預備把社會當做學校，以自然做我的老師，求些合乎實際應用的活動的科學。然而丨在我們這樣一個迷亂矛盾的社會裏，這究竟是太理想了，事實上指示，呌我不得不去進夜校。</p>
<p>ＸＸ補習學校，開學的第一天，我懷了滿腔的熱望，聽着我們的副校長的演說··［在這個補習夜校裏，我知道每一個學生的求學動機，都是自動而不是被動的，一定是自已掙錢供自已學費。所以我們開辦這補習夜校，純焠是爲着一般失學而好學青年而設立的，我們没有一些兒賺錢的性質。目下因爲財與力的限制，規模不免謭陋些，以後當力圖擴充，以達到完善的地步······］這些話，現在還很明晰地在我的腦子裏法躍着。但，一學期，現在是快完了，我得了些甚麽呢？這呌我不能不把關於請敎師的話要向我們的夜校提出商榷而請求做一個有效的糾正和改革！</p>
<p>第一件事，我們要應當知道的··一個敎師，不是有了很高的或是相當的學問便是能敎的。因爲［學問］和［敎］，根本就是兩回事。比如說，一個很有高深學問而没有精神及敎授經騐和興趣的敎師，他能把他的高深學問像水般的灌進學生們的肚子裏去嗎？所以，没有經騐和興趣的人來敎書，乾脆地說，他不是［敎書］，只是［混飯吃］！一個僅僅爲着吃飯而去站在講堂上指手畫脚亂喊瞎呌的東西，我們是不情願而且不合稱之爲［先生］的假使說，爲［混飯吃］而［敎］是說得通的，那麽，誰都要吃飯，不是阿猫極狗都可以跑上講堂去［敎嗎］？</p>
<p>然而，在我們的夜校裏，我們的敎師又是屬於那一種呢？事實上·誰也不能否認··最近在我的敎室裏只爲充滿了死的氛圍；全班同學丨其實，一蹋括子也只是零零落落的幾個啊！丨的眼珠都給蒙上了一重昏黄的暗影，所謂［興味］那給每個失望而沮喪的趕跑掉九霄雲外去了！請問··無論幹甚麽事情，一旦失却了［興味］而勉强地幹，還會再有生的氣槪嗎？我相信我們同學并不是在公事完畢後没有地方去消遣，没有地方去閒談或者甚至是没有地方去置身，我們在百忙中抽出閒來［補習］，這自然不是偶然的事情呀！總之··我們的敎師，至少我可以肯定的說，他是一個没有敎書經騐和興趣的人！</p>
<p>最後，我有兩句話向我們的夜校以及其他一切補習學校說的··當眞是［純粹爲着一般失學者好學的青年而設立的］（我們的副校長的話··我們需要有精神的經騐的興趣的敎師！</p>
<h3>星期日</h3>
<p>— 因</p>
<p>一星期一星期的過去，是這樣的迅遠，怎不呌心驚胆寒呢？到了星期日算是一星期最後的一日。</p>
<p>敎會裏的一般人，對這［星期日］是下了這樣的註解；［上帝六日創造天地萬物，到了第七日休息，稱爲安息日］。信基督敎的，當然是上帝，耶蘇忠實的信徒，因此每到星期日，就誠摯地挾了聖經到禮拜堂去做禮拜。</p>
<p>這也是同［知難行易］彷彿的，人民知道去用星期日，然而很多人都是盲目的，就是知道的，也祇以爲做了六日勞苦的工作，第七天應該安間地來休息一日。然而眞的在這日安閒地休息着有幾個呢？</p>
<p>大槪的學校，差不多都有了整整一天半的休息期（敎會學校棄掉了一個星期日的整上午，去做禮拜，最近一般學校棄掉星期六下午二小時的週會）我們的農人，生活已經瀕於破産的農村的農人，他們的星期日，他們的休息期在什麽地方呢？我們的勞工神聖，鎭日十二小時工作的勞苦大衆，他們的星期日又在那裏？就是有的，也是以生活費去代替的，大槪商人是無所謂休息不休息的吧，當然有一部份是例外的。阿！休息是人人需要的　誰是應該不休息的呢？街頭上總是擠滿着人，星期日不期然而然的會在無形中增多行人的數量，這完全是星期日反映的現象吧！啊！她們和他們是空間着而有着錢好去買東西呀··</p>
<p>影戲院星期日換片子，歡迎着休息着的人們。在這天，我們時常可以看［上下客滿］的牌子。高懸着大門的上面。還有ＸＸ跑狗塲，ＸＸ跑馬，回球力······變相的賭博。容納着大量的休息着的人兒。ＸＸ跳舞塲，ＸＸ戲園，ＸＸ世界······同樣有人擁擠着。</p>
<p>啊！我們看看社會的另一角呀！有大量的衆人ＸＸ正鬧着麵飽的恐慌呢？············啊丨社會原來是這樣的矛盾，都在星期日完全盡致地表現出來了！</p>

<h3>朱先生常吃米糟糠</h3>
<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>在普通的酒筵席上，有猜拳行令之餘興，雖則是俗例，但俗不傷雅，以助熱鬧，提起興趣不少··</p>
<p>夏歷的中秋佳節，各商店，照例備節酒宴客，是日在下應老友陳君某號　理之招，理當赴宴，至則高朋滿座，勝友如　　　　　個的酒席，佈置得有條　　　　　　　入席，下了總動　今，一時　頭像雨點般的下着，旨酒向尊口裏喝着，一時狂飲大嚼，秩序大亂，蓋我們商界中人，大都抱定［一根香］主義，非吃得碗底向天，决不肯輕易停筷比較文縐縐的敎書先生們的吃法，絶然不同··吃到酒至半酣，一個個的尊容上面，起了朶朶紅雲，於是酒興大發，大家要行酒令了··但雖則是商　　集團，其中也有一位在政界某機關裏辦事的朋友，那位朋友，出了一個酒令，他的酒令是每人須寫出三字連貫的詞句，而且要與本人職業有關係的，如若交白卷，則罰酒十杯。這個酒令發出之後，加入團體的，連在下其有五人，除政界中的一位朋友外，尙有一位是某米店老板。一位是姓朱的，他做什麽營業，也不明白，大家都喚他朱先生的。一位是該店裏的學徒，年紀不過十四五歲，他的口才，也很伶俐，倒是一個對答如流的好學生呢。臨到十起行式的我，現在總算在綢緞業中混混，也可算吃綢緞飯的一份子？將五位仁兄［在下除外］的略歷介紹清楚之後，正文來了！</p>
<p>第一位是政界朋友發起人先出馬，他寫着官宦家三字，［三個帽子頭］他自以爲官宦家，倒是一個很忠實的同志。第二位臨到在下，我就提起筆來寫上綢緞縐三字。［三個絞　旁］第三位臨到姓朱的朋友，他思索有頃，眉頭一皺，計上心來，他寫了朱先生三字。［三個牛字頭］第四位臨到米店老板，他當然容易得很，不慌不忙地寫了米糟糠三字，［三個米字旁］這三個字，和我的綢緞縐，似有異曲同工的意思，最後臨到那個學徒，他不假思索，寫着對聯式的兩句道，［官宦家穿着綢緞縐，朱先生常吃米糟糠。］語句雖屬戲謔，造句却很工穩，出諸十四五歲學徒之口，實是難能可貴啊？衆朋友們，瞧到了這　句綴成的對聯，都鬨堂大笑起來··惟有朱先生，則大不爲然，徒呼觸霉頭不置。</p>
<h3>課餘隨筆</h3>
<p>— 翔</p>
<p>ＸＸ大學寄宿舍的對面，是一列整齊的洋房，中間隔着一排矮矮的篱笆和一條寬暢的衖子，從樓上的寄宿舍裏望到衖堂裏去，什麽都可看見，毫不會遺留掉的，住在那衖子裏的，有外國人，有中國人，更多的是正當妙齡的中國姑娘！</p>
<p>一般無聯的大學生，守在這寂寞的樓頭，本來覺得生活太枯燥，想尋些什麽來滋潤滋潤，調劑調劑，現在來得正好，於是在課　感一有空閒的時候，大家便伏在窗子上，望着對面尋趣了。</p>
<p>衖堂裏的姑娘，也不是没有意思的。有兩個打扮得姣艶媚人，常常有意無意地把眼光斜呀斜的射過來。色情狂的青年，這時像被她們把心抓去了。飢渴貪婪的眼光，斜牢着她們，從上身到下身，在羨慕着，乞憐着。</p>
<p>［嘿嚕，今天大光明看電影去吧？走，走，］誰呌。</p>
<p>對手不響，那眞氣死人。駡呀，只配駡，不識抬舉的東西。</p>
<p>［媽的，像煞有介事，哼！］聲音是怪響亮的。</p>
<p>究竟回過頭來了，秋波像流星般一閃。阿，得勁，有意思。</p>
<p>［回頭］笑百媚生，衖堂粉黛無顔色。］哈哈！大家笑了。</p>
<p>大學生們在紛紛批評了··面孔誰美，乳部誰凸得出，臀部誰大。說着，又笑了，笑聲像要震倒屋子般的。</p>
<p>［老金，那穿緣旗袍的對你有意思呀！］</p>
<p>老金連忙推辭，［胡說胡說，老張有希望。］</p>
<p>［哈，我昨天走出校門，碰到那　頭髮的傢伙，她見我戴了眼鏡，科我四眼狗，［奶奶的腔，］小婊子！］胖子老吳說着，表面上裝着很憤恨的樣子。</p>
<p>［榮幸，榮幸。］大家誇奬他。</p>
<p>晚上，在路燈的微光閃耀中，這兩位姑娘又出現了。</p>
<p>［阿毛，大馬路去還是四馬路去？有一位尖着嗓子問。</p>
<p>［隨便，你說呀！］另一位回答。</p>
<p>［噲，等一等，我也去啦！宿舍裏歡狂的同聲。</p>
<p>［銅銅銅銅！］一陳樓梯響，一夥人追着去了。</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平（四四）（四幕劇）</h3>
<p>— 凌</p>
<p>第三幕　和平禮讚</p>
<p>金融巨頭··哦······兩位都這樣說，那就眞是拿我們來開玩笑了。老實說，在這年頭，誰還高興來派戰債？可是這也是没辦法的事。無論如何，我們總得　眼光看遠一點。不停戰，市面不安靜，不獨是金融停滯，匯兌不振，生意做不起來，連帶的工廠也得關門，這都是明明白白的事實。而且另一方面，江西方面的赤匪暴動，事實上是我們的心腹之患，假使比患不隊，那末我們的利益，勢必然是根本動摇。所以在這一方面說，我們絶對應當贊成停戰，以免牽制勦匪軍力。這是我們最三要的　　。那末現在停戰旣然發</p>
<p>生了財政上的問題，雖然這顯而易見的是藉此敲榨，但在這幾個大前提之下，總還得像［啞子吃黄連］似的勉任其難。所謂［苦在心頭］說不出又有什　辦法呢？</p>
<p>企業家··這套話誰不會說，可是總要我　　們拿得出來呀。</p>
<p>金融巨頭··旣這麽說，那末好的，我們都採取最後的手段；我們將金融封銷起來，和你們企業家斷絶來往，看你們的股票跌不跌價？</p>
<p>企業家··也好，大家同歸於盡，大家關廠，看你們金融家又到那裏去收回債欵？</p>
<p>商會長··好了好了，　　　　　　都是相依爲命的。不管怎麽的，到關店的時候再說。我們商家担任五百萬。反正停戰以後，日貨總是暢銷無阻的。劉先生方面担任六百萬，其餘的九百萬就讓銀行界承認了罷。事情已是這樣嚴理，你不答應下來就别想留腦袋出門。請問錢要緊還是命要緊？······不過在這裏却給我又多學了不少世故人情；我們没有自已的政府固不必說，就連我們平素所深信的田委員，也不是我們自已的人，而和他們他們打到一夥兒去了。</p>
<p>金融巨頭··這你到别寃枉好人，在這種高壓政策之下，你又有什麽辦法呢？我們被軟禁在這裏，難道他又不是軟禁在樓上嗎？（見機要秘書自絨幕後出）。賀秘書，請你請部長他們下來罷，現在有辦法了。（機要秘書上樓）。</p>
<p>企業家··哎！這眞是天知道！（靜默少頃）。</p>
<p>軍事當局··（偕政治當局，議和代表，秘書下樓）哦！諸位辛苦辛苦（與三人一一握手）賀秘書，敎他們解戒吧　秘書下諸位請坐，今天晚！　　　　　　　　　。　　　　　，我還没有徵求你的同意，我想就派這位余先生去做代表。好嗎？</p>
<p>政治當局··（停少頃）好的好的，部長意見我總贊同。</p>
<p>金融巨頭··請問部長，停戰條件的内容，可不可以宣佈一下。</p>
<p>軍事當局··這當然可以，不過得絶對秘密。是這樣的··日方帮助我國勦匪，我方取締抵貨運動，同時承認滿洲僞國，並且現在作戰區域，中國永遠不得駐兵。</p>
<p>大家同聲··哦······（秘書入）。</p>
<p>軍事當局··可是在外面宣佈的，却是······這不同說，過一二天在報紙上就可看得到的。好罷，來一瓶香檳。······諸位太辛苦了，請隨便坐罷。（馬弁端香檳上）。來，我們來喝杯香檳，爲中國和平慶祝··</p>
<p>中國和平萬歲！</p>
<p>大家同聲··中國和平萬歲！</p>

<h3>英國電影的新動向</h3>
<p>— 黄君如</p>
<p>跟着資本主義没落而没落</p>
<p>一般說來，英國電影是在落後。這不僅是不能與美國影片爭覇於中國市塲，就在歐洲也同樣地不爲觀衆所觀迎。近二年來雖極力改善，以充實品質，多量的注射娱樂的血液以迎合觀衆心理，與德國聯合製作和締結攻守同盟以增厚實力，來對抗美國··但是到處仍是不敵美片的力量。因此，連世人所公認以及他們自已所自傲的··［英片的特長是具有充分的娱樂］，也起了懷疑，而不得不把内容改變了。但是這一轉變運動，不是向着更好的方面，而是跟着日益走上没落之途的美國電影走。這從ＳoundＢityＬtd.公司主席關於英國影片公司前途的意見便可看出。他說··</p>
<p>［我們要知道電影是敏捷而會活動的機關，而成了現時代的藝術品。從前英國所有的影片對　觀衆只有興趣，而没有益處。因爲所放映者都是迷濛而輕脆的獻劇。現在好萊塢的出品，已運入本土，甚至暢銷於全球，牠的影片所以會得到觀衆的歡迎，是因爲牠的影片已經大改前非，由封建式的戲劇改爲現代藝術代的戲劇，由迷濛的默片改爲光亮的聲生，以現時代的有力量的思想來指示大衆，以大衆的生活爲背景，這幾點都是使也獲得藝術重要地位的理由。我希望英嗣電影今後須多着美人的後塵，以影片來爲民衆做宣傳工具，以有藝術化的戲衆，以有力量的思想獻給觀衆，現在我看得心滿意足的是本公司的出品Ｒeunion一片，因爲此片對於上述各點都完全俱備，而對於迷濛封建式的思想則完全廢除了。這樣越使我覺得　國電影的前途很有希望，很可慰丨演員們！快提起忍耐的心，以有價值的表演來喚醒大衆吧！］</p>
<p>難然上述的話，不是英國電影界全部的意見··但從此也就可以看見英國電影動向的一班了。總之，在資本主義支配下的影電，無論今後怎樣轉變，都只有跟着資本主義的没落而日益没落。</p>
<h3>評［春蠶］</h3>
<p>— 何連高原路伽凌鶴摩爾合評</p>
<p>（一）泛論文學作品的改編電影</p>
<p>作爲［敎育影片第一砲］，［生産影片的壓道車］的明星公司聲片［春蠶］，在新光開映了。雖然同日有幾家戲院換映新片，但，［春蠶］是買得滿座，新文壇和電影携手的第一聲，已經在事實上回答了惡意的破壞新文壇和雷影携手的人們！</p>
<p>了因爲分得泛論文學改編電影一的一節，同時，字數又須限制在五百左右，下邊我只能大略說一說。</p>
<p>名小說改編電影，不自［春蠶］始，我們隨處可以找到前例，但是小說改編電影是有幾點困難的。</p>
<p>第一，就是普特扶金所說的一故事太長，膠片上容不下去］，（電影導演論）</p>
<p>第二，就是文學的表現方法，和電影的表現方法不同。所以要把小說攝成電影，是非經過澈底改編一不下可的。例子很明顯··一［鐵騎紅淚一］，已經不同於［靜靜的頓河］，［西線無戰事　也不同於雷馬克的原著。何况文學方面，無論怎樣，要求［形象的表現］但是有些地方到底還可以用演講的方法，或則借人物的口中說出，而電影是完全需要動作和行動來表現，就是蘇聯一部份導演，所提倡的［用文學方法］［作内心描寫］，而這所謂［内心描寫］還不外於藉着動作來表現！</p>
<p>傳奇的故事，英雄的人物，對於羣衆是有興趣的。至於文學方面些作品，（像自由主義派）簡直儘量的把平凡的故事，平凡的人物來寫，電影雖則同樣的注重眞實，但是他也需要高潮！</p>
<p>因爲以上的原因，文學作品改編電影，是相當困難的，不過並不是絶對不可能，而須要高明的改編！（摩爾）</p>
<p>（二）自小說到電影</p>
<p>當然我們一點也不懷疑將素描小說搬上影幕的可能性，假使作家能夠抓緊某一部小說的中心材料，加厚劇的成分，而不成爲小說之俘慮的話。然而在這裏我以爲蔡叔聲先生過於忠於小說了，同樣程步高先生也過於忠於劇本了，以致我們的一春蠶還是盡面的小說，還是聯環圖盛，而不是嶄新的電影。</p>
<p>第　全片没有高潮，只是平平的開展，因此觀衆也同樣注意影片的全部，而没有特别注意影片的某一部份。結果觀衆也只有浮薄的印象而没有極强烈的記憶。</p>
<p>第二表現方式的不夠。好像多多頭把大蒜投在河裏，在文學方面或則是夠，表現多多頭的怨恨了，但是電影上是没有給觀衆明確和緊張的暗示效果。爲了給觀衆的印象的深刻有很多地方是必需誇張的。</p>
<p>第三，電影上的［春蠶］，應當加强悲劇的情調，如老通寳失敗以後，桑桑債欵，逼緊歸還等。關於這一點，我曾經和編劇者商量過，但因忠於小說之故，未便修改作罷。</p>
<p>不過這只是小的缺憾。這對於改編小說爲電影的嘗試，以上是應該指出的吧。（凌鶴）</p>
<p>（三）意識的含意</p>
<p>談到這一影片的意識，我們不能不談到原作者對於這種題材的處理方法，很明顯的，看完了全劇，我們找不到作者的中心意識，究竟在那里。自然，［没有離奇曲折的佈局，没有纒綿悱惻的情節，······］並不會妨害到這一故事的意識的發展，然而，並不是［没有香艶肉感的大腿······］而只是一幅農村的素描畫，就算盡了作者的任務的。</p>
<p>［春蠶］，這是以描寫農村破産爲題材的，究竟農村爲什麽破産呢？破産到什麽程度？農村産的問題，在現在嚴得到什麽樣子？在影片上，完全没有有很充分的告訴觀衆。我知道，馬上會有人提出嚴重的質問，在影片前面，不是有許多字幕，表格，在說明中國蠶絲的没落，日絲的侵奪市場，戰爭影響致於蠶絲市塲不開秤嗎？</p>
<p>無疑的，我不否認字幕表格的需要，但電影不能過份的藉重字幕表格的說明，這是誰都知道的。然而春蠶前面許多重要的地方，可以表現［現象］根源的情節而威迫着故事走向更緊張的階段的，只清閑的用簡單的說明表格來代替了。這樣一來，全劇於是平談的發展下去，没有最高點，也没有使觀衆了解農村破産是怎樣嚴重可怕，誰是農村破産的製造者，我們該怎麽辦。</p>
<p>我們看了一樣蓋術作品，假設使我們想到要幹一樣甚麽，那這一作品是成功的。春蠶，看了以後，只曉得在鄉村裏有一個農民老通寳養蠶失敗了，就止於此而已。是不是這樣，藝術家的任務就算完成了呢？在現階段的中國，農村破産已有使整個舊社會總崩潰而重建新社會的可能和事實，而原作者及編劇者又是目前文壇影壇的職權者·我們的要求不能不很高的。</p>
<p>高利貸，在農村破産中是起着很大的作用的，也是春蠶，全劇進展的一個壓力，但在影片上，是給通寳拾香烟及指着太太小姐穿綢緞而逃避描冩寫了。全篇描寫迷信的無用倒是成功的。在養蠶敎育上無多成就，因爲根本那些都是舊法子，没有在觀衆前通展宗科學化的蠶絲大産業的前途。</p>
<p>（四）導演的功績或缺憾</p>
<p>現在來檢討［春蠶］這一影片的道演手法。</p>
<p>［春蠶］的主旨是在表現農村的破産，它企圖將老通寳一家養蠶的困苦的生活眞眞實實描寫出來。可是我們覺得導演者對於那主旨還没有充分的把握，因爲老通寳一家的養蠶生活，在他們那種受盡種種剥削而貧困到只剩下了惟一的希望（蠶）的破産生活中，是多麽嚴重，緊張。可是畫面上並没有在這方面給觀衆滿足，總使人感到平淡，鬆散。這就是因爲導演者没有從那幾個不同性格的人物的描寫，及他們對蠶所應表現的情緒上去用功夫。其最顯著的例子，如在蠶的頭眼二眼三眼以至大眼的發長中，那一家人的情緒是應明白地逐漸提高的。這樣一來就可以相當地避免那種平淡和鬆散的毛病了。可是導演者在畫在上使我們覺得那家人在蠶而生長的情緒是停在平面上似的，没有什麽的變化。因此那種緊張的氣氛就不能製造出來了。還有對於蠶的那些特寫固然是很必要的，不過導演者要使觀衆單去注意蠶本身，面不把那些人物對於蠶的情緒充分地聯系地表現出，那當然會大大削滅了影片的效果了。如盛蠶來秤時，那家人的喜悅的表情，没有聯帶顯現在畫面上。這滅少很大的效果。導演者後來對於繭的展示把阿多等人聯系在一起，其效果就比前面的繭的單獨展示大多了。前面這個繭的展示實在很可以省去，不但它本身没什麽意義，並且還給予了後面那種展示不好的影響。</p>
<p>此外謂於配音的失當，導演當負責任。然而導演的功績仍有不少，因限篇幅不詳。一般的說，這是程步高先生較以前甚爲進步的作品。（何連）</p>
<p>（五）表演技巧其及他</p>
<p>一般地說來，［春蠶］諸演員的表演，都很可以。自首至尾没有一位演員有苟且的地方。可惜的是就中我們也找不出傑出的所在。比較的是嚴月嫺，鄭小秋和高倩蘋三位。小鄭除了［嫌油腔］一點外，在性格方面是表演得最成功的一個。本來以演慣漂亮人物的諸明星來演農夫田婦，難免有做作或過火之處。所以高小姐這幾步村姑步伐走得這樣，實在太不容易了。蕭英演的老通寳原是有很好的戲做，只可惜未能把這固執和世故的深刻處表演得到家。這對於他的化裝亦有絶大的關係的。蕭英心廣體胖，似不宜飾此名爲通寳而命不亭通也無寳的角色的。其餘如阿土是欠米貧農。也不該由由胖得如油缸師傅的人來演。服裝方面一般地還合身份。只是多多頭終始不曾換過衣服，老通寳老戴一頂毡帽，勞動者在這忙碌中連揩汗都没有工夫，除了癩痢頭，是不會愛這毡帽如命如。收繭以後的收債人，還戴尖頂瓜皮帽，這也是不合事實的。我背後一位談着摩登長·摩登短的觀衆，說開始時候的外景是［雪景］，這不知是他的錯覺呢，還是這片子的取光上眞有問題？内景太暗，除了上場介紹人不清外，這三個家庭令人難辦别。而相反地配音太噪又使觀衆聽着感到不快之感，雨聲是最大的例子。其餘當多多頭看守蠶，荷花來偷的這個塲面，配音簡直一點没有初夏深夜的情調。我想在桑葉已經吃完，老通寳等挑葉歸來後，餓蠶沙沙食葉之聲是很可以配出來的，可是本片中却没有。　　佈景上亦有錯處。此外還有幾個小毛病須要指出的，老通寳借錢的那個胖富人又依舊出現在無錫繭行裏，根生從這樣大雨中肩着桑葉回來，把　衣就脫在竹躺椅上，豈不把家中地上全流濕了嗎？農人的習慣是把濕的簑衣笠子拆在户外蒼下的。這兒我有兩點小意見··爲什麽幾個婦人幾次在溪畔老是洗衣服，換幾次淘米洗菜不更好嗎？（路伽）</p>
<h3>印度的英國影業</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>印度的電影業，現在仍舊是很幼稚的。他們遠不能同英美或别一國家的電影業相提並論，這是當然的。所以他們的電影業完全同没有組織的一樣，被别國占據着電影市塲中全部的地位。</p>
<p>在印度進口最多的景片首推英國。所有印度的影業差不多都是英國占據着。英國每年在印度的營業額達十餘萬鎊，這是印度影業總會的詳細調查。至於印度本國所設立的影片公司所進口的貨物，計原片每年共有一八八·四○○鎊，攝影機二三一，一五○鎊。</p>
<p>印度的影業現在還在默片時代。印度的制片業，共有一·八三五·○○○鎊的資本，演員六百零六人。有聲片演員四百五十一人，默片演員一百五十五人。製片家四十五人，但是所出的影片還不夠在孟買一處所需要的數目呢。</p>
<p>印度市塲上雖盡是英國影業的勢力，但是他們對於中國影片亦有相當的興趣。在南洋中國電影的區域内，有時有中國影片的印度銷塲，雖然中國片在外國的地位是很小的，但是在印度倒頗能佔些地位，印度人歡喜觀看中國影片的緣故不大明白，但是在印度給英國影業的霸占，終於使中國片的銷塲在印度不振。</p>

<h3>Disturbing North Peace in Three Routes</h3>
<p>National troops are on full alert in multiple directions</p>
<p>There was a local battle in Mafang yesterday morning</p>
<p>The defection of Fang is a delaying tactic</p>
<p>Tang's unit has arrived at Taoyukou</p>
<p>There is a rumor that Fang Zhenwu died in battle at Shahe Zhantao</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Fang's Army Positions in the Area of Da Xiao Fu Ren Zhuang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the armistice on the Pingbei front, there has been no contact from last night until this morning. Fang, Ji, Tang, etc. held a meeting in Nieshanying last night and decided to attack Beiping in three routes on the 9th. The central route will be undertaken by Fang's unit, attacking Mafang. The eastern route will be undertaken by Ji's unit, attacking Gaoliying along Da Xiao Dongliu. The western route will be undertaken by Tang's unit, attacking the Shahe line. Currently, Tang's unit has arrived at Taoyukou. Wan Ling's Zhu Hongxun and Zhou Fucheng two divisions are on full alert, and a part of Liu Duoquan's division has been additionally transferred to the front line for joint defense. A part of the 8th Artillery Brigade stationed in Xuanhua and a machine gun company, led by Battalion Commander Wang Feng, have been dispatched to Liangxiang and Fangshan to prevent the remnants of Fang and Ji from fleeing to the southwest. The 2nd Cavalry Division, Huang Xiansheng, is defending in the area of San Sheng Ting Xiao Ying near Shahe. The two divisions of the Central Army, Huang Jie and Guan Linzheng, have also been ordered to be on alert. The situation in Pingbei appears calm on the surface, but is actually extremely tense. Fang's defection is a tactic to buy time and is not genuine. Fang stated to the Japanese side that it was for internal purposes and hoped they would not pursue. Internally, he claimed it was resistance against Japan and requested permission to pass through the territory. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mafang telephone report: From this morning until evening, there were still local battles between the sentries of the two armies north of Mafang Village. At around 5 PM, enemy units of about a hundred people were discovered in Xinren Gou west of Mafang Village. Artillery fire was used to deter their advance. Fang's army was hidden in the large woods. Two regiments of Zhou's division are firmly guarding the northern positions of Mafang, monitoring the activities of Fang's army on the west bank of the Hulu River. Division Commander Zhou Fucheng arrived in Mafang this afternoon for inspection and convened a meeting of officers above battalion commander. The main force of Wan's army arrived at the front-line positions today to prevent Ji's army from launching a fierce attack to the south. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities still hope that Fang will send a responsible representative to Beiping to negotiate, so as to avoid civil war. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Intelligence reports that Tang's unit, consisting of two infantry brigades, one artillery regiment, and one cavalry regiment, totaling over 5,000 men, arrived near Taoyukou yesterday and advanced towards Xiaotangshan. Yesterday, Fang and Ji held a meeting in Nieshanying and decided to launch a general offensive on the 9th. Currently, all units of the national army are on full alert. A certain brigade of the 105th Division was ordered to depart from Xiyuan and Nanyuan towards the Ping-Sui Railway, and has now all arrived at Changping Shahe. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shahe dispatch: The North China Armored Artillery Team opened at Shahe Station tonight to guard the railway line. Fang himself rode to Tangshan from Nieshanying on horseback on the afternoon of the 8th to inspect. Fang and Ji's armies contacted Wang Ying, Zhantao and other units, and launched a general offensive on the morning of the 9th. Shahe was under martial law from 8 PM on the evening of the 8th. Fang sent over ten plainclothes agents, disguised as refugees, to Ping from Da Dongliu and then to Shahe to scout military intelligence, but they were captured by the garrison troops. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Conflict on the Front Since the 7th</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Military news, Gaoliying dispatch: The remnants of Fang and Ji are still surrounded in the area of Da Xiao Fu Ren Zhuang and the Hulu River. Because Fang has shown remorse and intention to surrender, our army has ceased attacking since yesterday. Currently, the front line has entered a state of armistice. At around 10 AM this morning, a Japanese aircraft bombed Fang's army positions in the area of Da Xiao Fu Ren Zhuang with four bombs, and then flew away. The damage is unknown. At 5 AM on the 3rd, Fang's unit attacked Qikongqiao, Yongling, Jingling, Laojuntang, and Xianling, but was repelled by our army. The enemy that attacked Changping on the 4th was the unit of Fang's brigade commander Zu Tingping, totaling over 2,000 men. After a fierce attack by Zhu's division, they retreated immediately. Brigade Commander Zu died on the spot in this battle, and his troops retreated north on the night of the 4th. The cavalry also retreated to the northeast the next morning. On the 5th, Fang's unit failed to attack Changping and retreated to the line of Da Liushu, Hulu River, Zhao Laixin Zhuang, and Xiaotangshan, and stubbornly resisted our army again. They were still in fierce fighting until the 6th. Since dawn on the 7th, both sides have ceased fighting. As of today, there has been no conflict on the front. This time, Fang's army only had about six or seven thousand soldiers. Each brigade had about two thousand men. Currently, apart from those killed and scattered by our army, there are no more than four or five thousand men left. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wan Fulin Did Not Send Anyone to Meet with Fang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin said: My responsibility is to defend the territory and protect the people. I have been ordered to suppress the remnants of Fang and Ji and will never let them flee south. The rumor that Fang sent a representative to visit me to request to be incorporated is not true. My responsibility is only military matters and I will not be involved in other matters. Fang did send a Mr. Wang to Beiping a few days ago, who went directly to the military branch to negotiate. As far as I know, the person who came was not Wang Zhongfu. If Wang himself comes, the problem should be easier to solve, because Wang has more influence in Fang's unit. Fang and Ji currently have limited strength, with no more than three or four thousand guns, and they are mostly of mixed types. The reason why the national army has not immediately resolved them is because they are all fellow countrymen and we cannot bear to kill each other. The authorities hope that Fang and Ji will realize their mistakes and consider the overall situation. Now that they have sent a representative to Beiping, we will see how sincere their expression is and then decide on a course of action. The front-line troops have been ordered to temporarily cease attacking and await further orders. Therefore, since zero hours yesterday morning, there has been no fighting between Fang and Ji in Datangshan. The rumor that I sent my adjutant Mr. Ma to Da Fu Ren Zhuang to meet with Fang to negotiate is absolutely not true, because I do not bear political responsibility and only follow orders. There is no reason for me to send a representative, and I have never met Fang and Ji. Some of their subordinates know me, but although they sent letters before, I did not reply to them. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tang Has Made Contact With Fang and Ji</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News from the front: In the fierce battle between the Ji-Fang allied forces and the 130th Division yesterday, many regimental and brigade commanders on their side were killed. Fang's brigade commander Zhantao was killed in battle. The Fang-Ji allied forces are currently occupying Xiaotangshan and Da Xiao Fu Ren Xin Zhuang. Xiaotangshan streets are covered with slogans, with words such as "Resist Japan and Save the Nation." According to intelligence reports, Feng Yulin's unit has recently made contact with Fang and Ji and plans to launch a large-scale offensive on Changping Nankou in a day or two. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang's Unit Has Withdrawn from Baishe Village</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shahe telephone report: 1. Fang's cavalry, led by Army Commander Li Dexin with over 300 men, fled west from Xiaotangshan to the Baishe Village Lengkeng area on the morning of the 7th. It is reported that there are over 1,000 joint infantry and cavalry troops gathering east of Baishe Village, attempting to disturb Shahe Town. The national army dispatched a cavalry regiment to intercept them, and Fang's army did not dare to advance. This morning, Huo Shouyi's brigade of the 105th Division arrived in Shahe to deploy defenses. This morning, the enemy near Baishe Village retreated towards Xiaotangshan. Ji's Second Army headquarters is located in the Dipi Company on Tangshan Street. Fang claims to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route of the People's Anti-Japanese Alliance Army, and the headquarters is located in Nieshanying. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tangshan is Covered With Reactionary Slogans</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Someone from the front line said: Tangshan fell on the 5th, and the main force of Fang and Ji immediately occupied the area. The area is currently guarded by Liu Zhenda's unit, the commander of the Second Army of the Northern Route of the People's Anti-Japanese Alliance, claiming to have two divisions. Businesses in Tangshan City were forced to open for business on the 7th, and the city is covered with reactionary slogans. Inspections are very strict. Postal vehicles passing through must obtain a pass before they can pass. Fang stipulates that captured national army officers are given five to three yuan in funds, but their freedom is restricted. A certain Fang aircraft dropped leaflets ordering them to retreat south, otherwise they would be bombed. Guan's division of the national army is currently deployed in the Cheshangou Hongshangou Dalingyuan area. Zhou's division is deployed in the Dongxi Pugou area, and Zhu's division is still guarding the line of Baishe Village, Lengkeng, and Guan Niu Fang. (8th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Are Experiencing Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Stopping National Day Celebrations</p>
<p>Singapore: Overseas Chinese public organizations in various major cities of Malaya are currently preparing to celebrate the Double Ten Festival. However, the overseas Chinese in Singapore are very indifferent to the National Day celebration. Only the overseas Chinese schools are making some decorations, but in any case, the lantern parade of previous years will not be seen again this year. Chinese Consul Liu of Penang recently convened a meeting for the National Day event. Although it was decided that a lantern parade would still be held on that day to express the overseas Chinese's concern for the motherland, it was eventually cancelled due to difficulties in raising funds. Since the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the overseas Chinese here have held lantern parades every National Day. This year, it was suspended due to economic constraints, which shows the hardship of the lives of overseas Chinese today. (3rd Reuters correspondence)</p>

<h3>Revitalizing Rural Areas Requires Improving Chicken Breeds</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry Formulates Opinions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Revitalizing rural areas requires improving chicken breeds. In 1931 and 1932, our country's main exports were: first place, head hair (mostly produced in the three northeastern provinces); second place, raw silk (gradually declining); and third place, fresh eggs and egg products, worth approximately 40 to 50 million yuan. Our country's method of raising chickens is sticking to conventions, and the number of eggs produced is decreasing year by year. I am afraid that in a few years, self-sufficiency may be insufficient. To revitalize rural areas, we must pay attention to improving chicken breeds. The domestic ordinary chicken produces an average of 60 eggs per year per chicken. On average, each family raises 10 chickens, and each egg is worth an average of 2 cents, so the annual income is 12 yuan. If the chicken breed is improved, although it is not expected to reach the US production record of 280 to 300 eggs per year, if each chicken produces an average of 150 eggs per year, with each egg worth 1.5 cents, it would be 22 yuan and 5 jiao, which is an increase of 10 yuan and 5 jiao in income per household. Extrapolating this to the whole country, the number is very considerable. The Ministry of Industry recently estimated that there are 388 million chickens in our country. Therefore, the purpose of raising chickens is to increase production. To increase production, there is no other way than to fundamentally improve chicken breeds. Opinions have been drafted and submitted to the Rural Revitalization Committee for reference. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Grain Merchant Tax and Handling Fees</p>
<h3>The Yuan Orders Strict Restrictions</h3>

It is specially ordered that the provincial governments deliberate on the local situation and properly establish fair measures for the grain merchants and brokers to collect tax and handling fees, and submit the handling situation to the Yuan for reference. (8th dispatch)</p>

Upon investigation, during the First Higher Civil Service Examination held in the 20th year, there were 2,177 applicants. This time, the number of applicants exceeds the first by 453, demonstrating that although the national crisis is extremely severe, the enthusiasm of scholars for seeking official positions has not only not diminished, but has also become more intense.</p>
<p>We currently have no way of knowing the experiences of these 2,630 Higher Civil Service Examination applicants. However, an examination of the statistics on the qualifications of the first applicants reveals that university graduates accounted for slightly more than 55%, vocational school graduates accounted for slightly less than 26%, graduates of military and police schools who took special exams for general administration and police administration accounted for 6%, those who passed the certification only accounted for 2%, those who passed the special qualification review accounted for less than 1%, and those who have served as officials and obtained the qualifications to take the exam accounted for 9%. In summary, those who are enthusiastic about taking the Higher Civil Service Examination are from universities and vocational schools, reaching 81%, which also shows that for gentlemen with higher education, there are few outlets and difficulties in making a living other than taking exams for official positions.</p>
<p>We do not intend to criticize the state's major policy of selecting talents, nor do we intend to condemn the actions of the candidates in seeking a way out. However, based on the proportion of those who applied for the first Higher Civil Service Examination, we assume that university and vocational students still account for 81% of the 2,630 applicants this time. Then, these 2,130 university and vocational graduates cannot dedicate their learning to society, which is also a matter worthy of study. Is it because the education they received is not suitable for managing society? Then the problem of university education reform arises. Is it because environmental factors have prevented them from fulfilling their desire to serve society? Then the problem of transforming the current social situation arises. Is it because they admire the honor and benefits of being an official and flock to this path? Then the problem of correcting the customs of scholars should arise. It is found that among the 2,177 examinees in the last examination, only 101 were selected. It is currently unknown how many of the 2,076 who were not selected have re-applied for this examination. If the Examination Yuan can announce this, so that the people can understand the results of the efforts of those gentlemen who failed the last examination to find a way out in the past two years, it will also be valuable material.</p>
<h3>Danube River Economic Cooperation Issue</h3>
<p>France and Italy Reach a Compromise</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to officials, Italy previously proposed a suggestion for Danube River economic cooperation based on the so-called "deliberate contract" principle. France and Italy have now reached a friendly compromise on this. The Little Entente countries had opposed this plan, especially Czechoslovakia, while Poland had no intention of disagreeing.

<p>US President Roosevelt</p>
<p>Fully Promotes Recovery</p>
<p>Establishing a New Rural Lending Institution</p>
<p>Warns Labor and Management to Save the Nation Together</p>
<h3>Final Report on Recognition of Soviet Russia Completed</h3>
<p>(Washington) The new array of the US President's economic recovery battle today contains a vast area of activity. On the one hand, the president severely warns the recalcitrant industrialists and arrogant labor leaders; on the other hand, he organizes a new rural lending institution; and on the other hand, the State Department is studying the possible economic and political consequences of recognizing Soviet Russia and preparing a final report.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes Must Be Suspended</h3>
<p>The President's warning, delivered at the dedication ceremony of Labor Leader Gompers' memorial, stated that labor-management disputes must be temporarily shelved until the economic recovery battle is won. Now is not the time to seek special rights and special interests. He then discussed the general arrogance of some laborers who believe they can achieve their desired results through clamor and violence, declaring that such individuals should join the majority of workers in rescuing the nation from its difficulties. Subsequently, he warned industrialists whose minds are solely focused on money and disregard human life, asserting that most employers are aware of the nation's perilous situation, but a few stubborn ones must be restrained. Finally, he praised Gompers for uniting countless labor organizations into a large group and encouraged the workers.</p>
<h3>Hull Studies Recognition of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Within the State Department, Secretary of State Hull, along with Philip D. Baker and others, are studying the expected political, economic, and diplomatic consequences of recognizing Soviet Russia. The final report, to be submitted to the US President today, predicts that Russia could potentially purchase $350 million worth of goods from the US, providing employment for 500,000 Americans. The report also addresses legal aspects of establishing diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries. However, it is reported that the content of the report is limited to the collected facts and does not include any recommendations.</p>
<h3>Loan Bureau Prioritizes Relief for Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>On the agricultural front, the Department of Agriculture is also focusing its full efforts on the recovery plan. The department has collaborated with the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation to establish a goods loan bureau, prioritizing relief for cotton and wheat. Farmers who are willing to comply with the government's acreage reduction plan can use their goods as collateral for loans. Farmers willing to reduce cotton production can pledge their cotton at one dime per pound. This matter will be handled by the bureau. In the future, it is planned to extend the mortgage loan plan to other commodities. The bureau's purpose is twofold: to stabilize prices and establish minimum prices, and to meet the financial needs of agricultural cooperatives or farmers implementing their improvement plans.

<h3>Roosevelt Consults with Steel Industry</h3>
<p>(Washington) With the coal and steel industry strike areas entering a calmer state, the nation's attention is shifting to Washington, watching for new steps to restore peace to these two industries. President Roosevelt is currently consulting with steel industry leaders, seeking to facilitate a final resolution. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, striking miners' pickets, though under official surveillance, are quietly maintaining their picketing activities. Advisor to the National Recovery Administration, Lee Chee-burg, stated that he hopes to resolve the various difficulties through the current implementation in the coal industry. Today, Lee Chee-burg met with representatives of mine owners and miners for a long time. Judging by the appearances, if steel workers are unwilling to concede to Roosevelt's plan to mediate wage disputes, then President Roosevelt will use his power to resolve the issue quickly.

<p>Disarmament Conference Reopens Today</p>
<p>US Government Expresses Serious Concern</p>
<p>Opposes Germany's Immediate Military Equality</p>
<p>Germany Indicates Room for Negotiation in its Reply</p>
<p>(London) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson departed from London for Geneva today, to preside over the most critical conference since it convened 19 months ago. He was in good spirits as he left. After the Disarmament Conference adjourned, Henderson had presided over negotiations on a few key points, without achieving any progress that would make one confident that an agreement would be easily reached. But today, it is not impossible to obtain full agreement to facilitate the early signing of a disarmament convention. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Reliable sources here have learned that the US government considers Germany's demand for immediate military equality as a price for complying with the disarmament plan, which is a serious development in the world situation. Although the instructions given to US representative Davis by the government have not been released, it is believed that the US position will advocate that Germany's restoration of its armed status should be gradual and not achieved overnight.</p>
<p>The German representative had proposed that the McDonald's proposed convention be read for the second time immediately after the reopening of the Disarmament Conference, so as to take the opportunity to present Germany's position, but it is said that France will oppose this proposal. Therefore, at Monday's meeting, there will likely be intense debate over the procedures, with one faction advocating immediate progress in formulating a convention, and the other faction supporting a postponement of public discussions in order to have opportunities for private negotiations. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government attaches great importance to the news from Geneva that Germany is demanding the right to rearm, but does not want to take any action until it receives a formal detailed report from US representative Davis. According to responsible sources today, when other countries unanimously advocate disarmament, but an important country blatantly plans to rearm, the US government will definitely regard it as a serious event. Many feel that the US has sufficient reason to negotiate with Germany based on the 1921 US-Germany armistice treaty. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Pang Gu arrived here from Paris this afternoon to prepare to attend next week's disarmament talks. Upon arrival, he met with US representative Davis and Italian representative Aloisi, among others. Afterwards, Davis went to Rome to meet with Mussolini. The current situation seems better than before, as the German side indicated that there is room for negotiation on the proposals they have put forward. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>England Advocates Intervention in European Affairs</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson, in a speech at the annual meeting of the International Peace Federation, strongly opposed the [Glorious Isolation Policy] that England has always pursued, considering it an absurd and impractical policy. Privy Councilor and Conservative Party leader Baldwin also stated again at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham that England must ensure that all the treaties it has signed are respected. The Sunday publications here have re-evaluated these speeches by Henderson and Baldwin, believing that [England's glorious isolationism has now fundamentally ended.] For example, the Times Sunday edition said that [it is inappropriate to treat Geneva and Ottawa as equivalent terms. In the past, whether justified or not, England could ignore European affairs. Since the development of aviation, we can no longer stand idly by the governance of Europe, because the narrow strip of the North Sea can no longer be regarded as a reliable defensive wall.] As for how England should care about European affairs, the press believes that the only possible way is to respect treaties. As the [Observer] said, [When Germany violated Belgium's neutrality, England rose up to participate in the war in the name of fulfilling the neutrality treaty. I am afraid that no one can recall the situation when England signed the guarantee of neutrality treaty in the past. Anyone who doubts England's loyalty to the Locarno Treaty can rest assured after seeing this.] As for the possible failure of the Disarmament Conference, the newspapers all advocated that bilateral treaties should be signed by various countries to remedy it. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party held a meeting in Birmingham. Today, Land Secretary Halshan attended the meeting and gave a long speech, briefly stating that we have not yet disarmed to the limit of safety, which is undeniable. The British delegation in Geneva has submitted a draft to the League of Nations, which has revived the Disarmament Conference. It is currently difficult to predict whether this draft can be implemented. If the Disarmament Conference unfortunately fails, then the responsible party is not England. If the responsibility for the failure is not borne by those who should bear it, then it is not the fault of the British government. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>France Does Not Want to Harm Other Countries</h3>
<p>French Vichy French Premier Daladier gave a speech here today at the Radical Socialist Party Congress, saying that we have voluntarily agreed to sacrifice armaments, which is unprecedented in history. We do not dream of harming or insulting any country, regardless of its political system. If we do not have an international agreement, we are unwilling to continue to reduce armaments, and this international agreement must have sincere goodwill and build a control mechanism to implement disarmament in order. Daladier continued to say that the budget must be balanced. The parliament will be convened in a few days. Fiscal reform should be determined within a week of the parliament's opening, otherwise another government must be formed. Daladier went on to express satisfaction with Chamberlain's remarks at the British Conservative Party Congress that Britain shares European responsibility and belongs to the international agreement to maintain European peace, and said that there is no dream of insulting Germany now. Since the German government insists that its purpose is peace, then why is Germany conscripting young men in the country, and why is it asking for the right to build expensive war equipment, because if the disarmament convention is signed and implemented, then the war equipment it requests must be destroyed, and so on. (Reuters, 8th) French Radical Party Congress</p>
<p>Resolves Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Full Trust in the Current Government</p>
<p>Abolish War Debts and Sanction Aggression</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the Extreme Socialist Party Congress passed the proposal drafted by Kaiser, stating that the party fully agrees with the foreign policy of all extreme parties after May 1932, and stating that France's foreign policy needs to continue to proceed, in order to be in line with the spirit of the basic ideals of the League of Nations without any gap, and that freedom and independence must be guaranteed, especially in Austria. Furthermore, the party's declaration later advocated the abolition of all war debts, and hoped that countries could establish a disarmament treaty including the following points: (1) Abolish the manufacture of private armaments and the business of private military products, (2) Monitor the places where countries manufacture military products, (3) Internationalize and transform aviation and chemical industries to prevent their use by aggressors. Subsequently, if an act of aggression occurs, international monitoring of countries around the world should be sanctioned immediately. In addition, the disarmament plan should be implemented gradually after the trial period, and the disarmament agreement should clearly stipulate it, and it should take effect according to the strength of the monitoring.

<h3>Romania's Foreign Minister Formally Visits Poland</h3>
<p>And will Travel to Various Eastern European Countries</p>
<p>Warsaw Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu is scheduled to lead two senior officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here on October 9. Polish political circles believe that this is Titulescu's first official visit to Poland as Foreign Minister. Titulescu is scheduled to travel to various Eastern European countries. After departing, he will first visit Poland, which is a new evidence of the friendship between Romania and Poland. It is also said that when Titulescu comes to Poland, he will also represent the Romanian government in ratifying the [Definition of Aggressor] Convention signed in London on July 3. According to diplomatic documents, it is the first time that the Soviet Union and Romania have jointly signed. Polish political circles believe that Poland has always acted as a mediator between Romania and the Soviet Union. The coordination between Russia and Russia is a definite guarantee of peace in Eastern Europe. Therefore, the ratification of the London Convention is a success for Polish diplomacy. (According to the July 3 Definition of Aggressor Convention, it was co-signed by eight countries: the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia, Poland, and Romania.) (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Preparing to Negotiate with Australia</h3>
<h3>As Vague as the Simla Conference</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Australian government's British Empire preferential tariff and the implementation of the anti-dumping tax plan, after inquiring with Murai, the Consul-General stationed in Sydney, on the 6th, said that since the British government banned gold exports, the pound sterling and the Australian pound have fluctuated, that is, in the exchange rate between Japan and Australia, one yen of Japanese gold is one shilling and six pence of Australian dollars, and between Japan and England it is one shilling and two pence. Therefore, according to the provisions of the 1921 Protection of Industry Law, the tariff has been suddenly revised, and the regulations for imposing differential tariffs on Japanese goods have been established, but its implementation must consult the Tariff Commission. As for whether it will be implemented immediately, it has not yet been determined. However, the reason why the Australian government has taken this attitude is that the negotiation of the Japan-Australia Treaty of Commerce will begin this autumn, so it is preparing to rectify in advance. Foreign Minister Hirota telegraphed Consul-General Murai yesterday, instructing him to protest to the Australian government. On the one hand, for the conclusion of a treaty of commerce, he also ordered preparations for negotiation. (Electric News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The countermeasures of Japan against the Simla Conference have great political significance. The immediate purpose is to solve the trade problem and seek the sales of Japanese goods. On the inside, it is to promote the anti-British sentiments of the Indians by resisting Indian cotton and reduce the anti-Japanese forces of the British Empire. Britain knows the inside story, so it specially co-opts India to take a common front. Indian industry is still in the hands of British capitalists. Although British and Indian capitalists have opposed each other due to conflicting interests, from the overall perspective, their interests are consistent with those of Indian farmers. The reason why Britain and India have recently been consistent with Japan is here. The only diplomatic means for Japan to deal with Britain and India is to incite Indian farmers. However, for the countermeasures against Indian farmers, there is no other way than to intensify the resistance to Indian cotton and make the farmers rise up. The future of the Japan-India Conference is very pessimistic. It is said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very anxious. If the Simla Conference really fails, then the Japanese economic circles at the end of the year will be even more unimaginable. Foreign Minister Hirota is working hard to open up diplomacy with China, trying to restore the illusion of the Chinese market, stabilize the people's hearts in the country, and reverse the depression of the economic circles.

<h3>Regulations on the Issuance of Customs Treasury Bills are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance reports that the regulations on the issuance of customs treasury bills are still being drafted by the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance and will be completed soon. The method of paying for the treasury bills by the banking community will be distributed according to the amount of money deposited by each bank in the past month, offsetting the repayment of old debts, calculated at 80% or 90% of the face value. The rumor that it will be mortgaged at 50% is a misrepresentation. Currently, Song Ziwen and Zou Lin have been in Shanghai for consecutive days to contact the banking community separately, and they have generally agreed. In addition to repaying old debts, the balance will be withdrawn from the banking community in cash after the pre-arranged bills are printed, and given bonds to regulate military and political expenses.

<h3>China's Production of Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An expert from the Rural Reconstruction Association said that China's rice and wheat production is estimated to be more than 900 million dans of rice grain per year and more than 40 million dans of wheat per year (including the Four Eastern Provinces). The reason for the import of foreign rice and wheat over the years is mostly due to floods, droughts, wars, and insect pests, which lead to insufficient production. Rice-producing countries such as India, Annam, and Siam have increased their production year by year, and their export capacity has increased day by day, and they are trying their best to sell to us. The same is true for wheat flour. This is also another major reason for the import of foreign rice and wheat into China. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Adds Another Tax</h3>
<p>Raw Silk Inspection Fee and Silkworm Improvement Fee</p>
<p>Silk Merchants Unanimously Strike and Request Abolition</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong government recently decided to impose a raw silk quality inspection fee of two yuan per bale and a silkworm improvement fee of four yuan per bale, effective October 1st, to be collected by the Construction Department for unified distribution and management. The Raw Silk Inspection Office was ordered to implement the fee on schedule. Silk merchants, citing the sharp decline in Guangdong silk exports and the drastic drop in silk prices, with each bale falling to over 400 yuan, argued that the imposition of additional taxes would jeopardize the future of the silk industry. They immediately convened a meeting of all silk merchants and resolved to send representatives to petition the government, imploring them to consider the merchants' difficulties and postpone the implementation. If unsuccessful, all silk merchants in Guangdong would unanimously cease foreign trade to demonstrate their determination. Any merchant who violated the collective decision and engaged in private transactions would be subject to unanimous sanctions. Simultaneously, in the name of the Guangdong Silk Industry Research Association, the Guangzhou Foreign Firm Silk Trade Association, and all silk merchants, a telegram was sent on September 26th, appealing for the exemption of the improvement fee, stating: "The silk industry has suffered severe losses for years. Since the tax reduction last year, the industry has not recovered. Recently, silk prices have plummeted, and mulberry values have followed suit. Farmers and merchants alike are suffering heavy losses. Adding further burdens is unbearable. The way to salvation should focus on fundamental improvements, but to levy fees on silk again without raising separate funds is akin to quenching thirst with poison and treating a wound by cutting away flesh. We fear that the effects of improvement will not be seen, and the destruction of the silk industry will be immediate. Silk merchants going bankrupt is regrettable, but what about the millions of farmers and workers in Guangdong who will lose their jobs? We dare to appeal to you to consider the decline of the silk industry and the hardship of farmers and workers, and swiftly abolish the attached silkworm improvement fee. Only when the silk industry has truly improved, silk prices have rebounded, and exports have greatly increased, should you consider levying the fee again." However, the government did not grant the request. Subsequently, silk merchants repeatedly sent representatives to petition the authorities, detailing the difficulties of the silk industry in recent years, but their appeals were not heeded. To maintain its authority, the government, on the day of the announcement of the collection of the silkworm improvement fee on the first of this month, rented a store on Xinxing Street in Shaqi as a fee collection office. However, silk merchants also unanimously went on strike from that day onward. Orders for raw silk from various European and American countries were all suspended. Therefore, since the opening of the fee collection office, no silk merchants have come to pay the tax, and the fee collection office has not received any revenue. It is reported that if no solution is found, silk merchants will convene silk merchants and workers from various counties to the provincial capital to stage a large-scale petition movement to achieve the goal of abolishing the fee.

<h3>Chaoshan Opposes Taxing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Because the Rice Production of Various Counties Cannot Meet the Demand</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the provincial government decided to levy taxes on foreign rice, the Chaoshan and Meizhou regions have been greatly shaken. The annual rice production of the 15 counties in Chaoshan and Meizhou and the 20-plus counties on the Fujian-Jiangxi border is only sufficient for three months. The remaining nine months rely entirely on foreign rice. In recent years, due to frequent natural and man-made disasters, the people have already felt extremely distressed in rescuing the dying and supporting the wounded. This year, Raoping and other counties have suffered poor harvests due to drought in both spring and autumn, while farmland in Fengshun and other counties has been severely affected by cattle plague and rodent and insect infestations, resulting in even greater losses. The farmers, already worried and saddened, were suddenly faced with the news of rice taxes, further increasing their fear of food shortages. The municipal chamber of commerce, the North-South Port Grain Trade Association, rice shops, etc., have all sent telegrams to the Southwest Political Committee, the provincial government, and the finance department, requesting revocation, but it is reported that the finance department has replied that the request for revocation cannot be approved. As for the Chaoshan area, the annual collection of foreign rice tax can amount to over 8 million yuan. The finance department has already sent personnel to Shantou to set up a branch office. However, during the period of resistance, all imported foreign rice is first registered upon entering the warehouse, with Xiao Songqin, the Shantou Customs supervisor, guaranteeing that the special tax will be paid in full if required. Rice merchants, in addition to sending telegrams to Siam and Annam to stop processing rice for import, have also sent Wu Sihai and others as representatives to the provincial capital to fight for their case and participate in the request of representatives from the Guangzhou Rice Bran Association. Currently, rice shops in Shantou have not only decided to stop transporting foreign rice to Shantou, but also transported the rice stored in warehouses to the interior for hoarding and sale, with the price of each bag of rice rising by more than one yuan compared to normal, causing the poor to cry out in misery. Furthermore, most of the exporters of rice in the three major rice-producing regions of Siam, Annam, and Rangoon are Chinese merchants, especially people from Guangdong and Chaozhou. The taxation of foreign rice has affected the industrial and commercial sectors of overseas Chinese. Major monopolies in Guangxi and Shantou have sent telegrams to prevent the payment of rice, and most have stopped operating. It is reported that the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and various overseas Chinese organizations in Britain and the Netherlands have also telegraphed Guangdong, requesting the abolition of the rice tax, but the provincial government is determined to implement the tax, so it is difficult to expect results.</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Levies Foreign Rice Tax</h3>
<p>And Abolishes Tea Export Tax</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Rural production in Fujian Province is declining, and the economy is withering. Among them, the decline in tea exports and the increase in foreign rice imports have the greatest impact. In order to revitalize the rural economy, the provincial government specifically passed a resolution on the 4th of this month at the 269th committee meeting to levy an import tax on foreign rice and abolish the export tax on tea to provide relief. This move is of great importance to the economic future of the province. The draft of the provisional regulations for restricting foreign rice imports is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: These regulations are specifically formulated in this province for the purpose of protecting agricultural production and revitalizing the rural economy. Article 2: When grains and rice not produced in this country are transported and sold in this province, import tax shall be levied in accordance with these regulations. Article 3: The import tax on foreign grains and rice shall be assessed by dan, and each dan shall weigh one hundred catties (equivalent to 133 and one-third pounds of Customs pounds). Article 4: The import tax on foreign rice is one silver dollar per dan, and the import tax on foreign grains is 65 cents per dan. Article 5: The import tax on foreign grains and rice shall be collected by a bureau established by the Department of Finance. Article 6: Any merchant who transports and sells foreign grains and rice for import shall fill out a declaration form and request the competent collection agency to inspect, verify, pay taxes, and receive a ticket. If it is transshipped for distribution, a sub-transport license must be applied for. The tax ticket and sub-transport license mentioned above shall be formulated and issued by the Department of Finance. Article 7: When foreign grains and rice that have already paid import tax are transported to various parts of this province for distribution, if they pass through other tax collection agencies, they shall be released after verifying that the documents and photos match, and no further taxes shall be levied. Article 8: Any merchant who transports foreign grains and rice and refuses to declare and pay taxes or refuses to accept inspection shall have all the goods they are transporting detained. If they still fail to deal with it themselves after five days, all the detained goods shall be sold off and confiscated. Article 9: Anyone who transports foreign grains and rice for import and has one of the following behaviors shall, in addition to detaining the goods and paying supplementary taxes in accordance with regulations, also be subject to a fine of one to five times the amount of tax due, depending on the severity of the circumstances. If they still fail to comply after five days of the judgment, the detained goods shall be handled in accordance with the preceding article: (1) Intentionally evading taxes or reporting more than the actual amount; (2) Inconsistent or altered or reused tickets; (3) Forging tickets. Article 10: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of submission to the Provincial Government for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Finance's investigation, the amount of foreign rice imported into this province is approximately one million dan per year in Xiamen and approximately two hundred thousand dan per year in Fuzhou. Therefore, abolishing the tea export tax and changing to levying the foreign rice import tax, based solely on oral collection comparisons, will also result in a surplus. (October 5th)</p>
<h3>Suiyuan National Goods Hall Opens</h3>
<p>Product Competition Held Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Construction Department Actively Promotes National Goods Suiyuan Correspondence: The newly built National Goods Exhibition Hall of the Construction Department of Suiyuan Province held its opening ceremony at 10:00 a.m. on the 1st. The Product Competition organized by the department also began on the same day at the hall, lasting for three days. These two events are both firsts in Suiyuan Province and are extremely lively. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The National Goods Hall is built on the north side of the road inside the West Gate of the New City. In the center of the top of the gate, a national flag is inserted high. A red satin horizontal plaque is hung at the entrance, with large black velvet characters pasted on it, reading "Suiyuan Province Product Competition." Satin couplets are also hung on both sides, with the couplets reading, "National goods promotion, hoping to save the right of benefit and work together; Product competition, promoting the development of industry and planning the border together." On the wall on the left side, the four large characters "Increase Production" are written, and on the left wall, the words "Promote National Goods" are written. The venue is set up on the square platform in front of the National Goods Hall. Around the courtyard walls are temporary markets for various merchants in the city. The halls are divided into product departments of various counties, and national goods from various provinces are displayed inside, with exquisite layouts. In front of the platform are chickens, geese, and other items produced by various counties, and in the southwest corner are sheep produced by various counties. On the morning of the 1st, various circles had already arrived in an endless stream to attend the exhibition. At around 10:00 a.m., Feng Xi, Director of the Construction Department, Yuan Qingzeng, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Shi Huayan, General Manager of Reclamation Affairs, Zhang Xiusheng, Supervisor of the Saibei Customs, Zeng Houzai, Secretary of the Provincial Government, and Dr. Zhang Kezhong, Director of the Applied Chemistry Research Institute of Nankai University and Professor of Chemical Engineering, who arrived in Suiyuan from Tianjin yesterday, successively arrived. At this time, the audience had reached over 3,000. Then, the bell rang to start the meeting. Under the leadership of Feng Xi, the chairman of the conference, they performed a ceremony. First, the chairman reported, first explaining the significance of holding the National Goods Exhibition and Product Competition, then talking about the crisis of commerce in Suiyuan Province and the necessity of promoting national goods, and finally encouraging the people of Suiyuan to emulate the industrial zones of Wuxi, Shanxi, and other places in the future, and strive to increase production and save the right of benefit. Then, Hao Bingrang, a representative of the Suiyuan Provincial Party Department, and Zhang Kezhong and Yuan Yingchang gave speeches. After the speeches, photos were taken and the meeting was dismissed. It was already noon. The conference began to evaluate the products of various counties from the 1st. (October 2nd)</p>
<h3>Academia Sinica Excavates Antiquities in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>Excavations in Zou, Teng, and Yi Counties</p>
<p>Preparations Nearing Completion, Work to Begin at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Jining Correspondence: During the Spring and Autumn Period in ancient Shandong Province, in addition to the two major states of Qi and Lu, there were also the states of Teng, Xue, Zou, Zhu, and others. Therefore, the history is long and there are many antiquities. Earlier, the discovery of Zhou Dynasty bronze tripods and other artifacts in Teng County had already caused a sensation throughout the country. Because of their historical and cultural significance, they are all regarded as rare treasures and have been transported to Jinan for preservation, awaiting research by archaeologists. Recently, even more valuable stone chambers from the Book of Han have been discovered. Unfortunately, many have been destroyed and scattered, making it difficult to see the whole picture. Now, in order to preserve antiquities and study the history and culture of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and subsequent generations, Academia Sinica has specially sent Dong Zuobin and Wang Xiantang of the Shandong Ancient Sites Research Association to be responsible for excavating antiquities in the three counties of Zou, Teng, and Yi. Work will begin soon. Zou County was the state of Zhu during the Spring and Autumn Period, and was renamed Zou during the Warring States Period, which is the birthplace of Mencius. It was first established as a county during the Han Dynasty and still retains its old name today. Sheng County was the site of the small three states of Teng, Xue, and Zhu during the Spring and Autumn Period. It was called Fan County during the Han Dynasty, and was renamed the current name during the Sui Dynasty. It has not been changed since the Ming and Qing dynasties. "Shu Xiu," the son of King Wen of Zhou, was enfeoffed in Teng, and the name of the state first appeared in history. Yi County is named after Mount Yi, also known as Zouyi Mountain, or Zhuyi Mountain, which now stands towering in the southeast of Zou County. After Emperor Qin conquered the six kingdoms, he toured eastward to Mount Yi in the 28th year, inscribing a stone to commemorate his achievements. The stone carvings of Mount Yi, handed down through the generations, are the commemoration stele of Emperor Qin. The state of Kuai during the Spring and Autumn Period is the current Yi County, which was changed to Lanling by Chu. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. During the Jin Dynasty, it was Lanling Prefecture. The reason why the central government's search for antiquities is limited to the three counties is because of the fact that the Education Department of the Shandong Ancient Sites Research Association has presented a request to the Education Department, which in turn requested the provincial government to issue an order to the three counties of Zou, Teng, and Yi to assist in protection. After Dong Zuobin, sent by the Central Research Institute, arrives in Jinan, excavation work can begin at the end of this month. Today, the reporter specially visited Wang Xiantang, the curator of the Provincial Library, and asked about the methods of excavating antiquities and the purpose of excavation. According to him, the purpose of excavation is entirely to investigate ancient history and culture from ancient sites. For ancient tombs that have already been destroyed, they will be investigated, while others that are intact will not be allowed to be excavated and will be effectively protected. The three counties of Zou, Teng, and Yi are adjacent to each other. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, they were the sites of the states of Teng, Xue, Zhu, and Zou. The changes in their ancient national borders and the reforms in modern county boundaries are related in geography and history. Therefore, in order to clarify the ancient history and culture of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the scope of the excavation of antiquities is designated as the three counties of Zou, Teng, and Yi. The Academia Sinica has assigned Dong Zuobin, who will arrive in Jinan soon, and work can begin at the end of the month. (7th)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Establishes an Inspection and Distribution Office in Shandong</h3>
<p>Office Opens First in Jinan</p>
<p>Inspection and Distribution Sub-offices Established in Each Disaster Area</p>
<p>Surveying the Types of Relief Supplies Needed</p>
<p>Mei Yilin Scheduled to Arrive in Shandong on the 10th</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Regarding the flood in western Shandong, the central government has repeatedly sent personnel to conduct thorough inspections. In addition to the dispatch of medical teams to the disaster areas by the health group of the Flood Relief Committee to diagnose and treat diseases for the victims, preparations are now being actively made to distribute relief grain and clothing, as it is now autumn and the weather is getting colder. The central government has allocated 1.5 million yuan in relief funds to the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Although the specific allocation has not yet been clarified, it is reported that a general method has been drafted, with Shandong receiving 500,000 yuan. In addition to the 100,000 yuan that has already been remitted and allocated to the Shandong Provincial Government for emergency relief, there is still 400,000 yuan left, which will be used to purchase relief clothing, relief grain, seeds, and other materials for distribution. (It is planned to prepare 45,000 sets of relief clothing, each set costing 2.9 yuan). In order to carry out investigations of the disaster situation and distribute relief supplies, the Disaster Relief Group has come to</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>(Shen Bao, Page 3)</p>
<p>Shandong to establish the "Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Disaster Relief Group Shandong Inspection and Distribution Office." All personnel arrived in Jinan yesterday. The director, Cheng Jingsheng, has not yet arrived. The deputy director, Yin Chengzhi, and six staff members, after arriving in Jinan, were provided with housing by the Provincial Relief Affairs Association. The address is at Tiegong Temple on the shore of Daming Lake. The office has started working today. According to Yin Chengzhi, the duties of the inspection and distribution office are to investigate the need for and distribute relief supplies, such as relief grain, relief clothing, and seeds. In addition to the establishment of this office in Jinan, sub-offices will be established in the affected counties in order to investigate the severity of the disaster situation and the population of the victims, and to determine the allocation of relief grain and clothing. Counties with severe disaster situations and inconvenient transportation will each have an inspection and distribution sub-office. Counties with convenient transportation, or several counties together, will have one sub-office. All are required to be established by the end of the month. Xi Dejiong, the chairman of the Disaster Relief Group of the Relief Committee, sent a letter today, instructing them to investigate what kind of relief supplies are needed and what kind of wheat seeds are needed. Therefore, it is planned to conduct a nearby investigation in Jinan first and then investigate other counties. In addition to the cotton clothing that is already being manufactured in Beijing, it is planned to purchase relief grain in Shandong in order to save on transportation costs. The water in the disaster area has receded, and it is urgent to plant wheat, so the investigation and distribution of wheat seeds are particularly important for sowing, etc.</p>
<p>Mei Yilin, the Major General Director of the Military Affairs Committee, previously took a plane to inspect the disaster situation in western Shandong and has reported the dire situation of the flood to the central government in detail. Now, the health group of the Flood Relief Committee has sent personnel to Jinan to establish an office and has dispatched four medical teams to the disaster areas of Yuncheng, Jining, Heze, and Fanxian in western Shandong to diagnose and treat the victims. Mei is scheduled to depart from Beijing again on the 10th to inspect the work of the medical teams. Today, he sent a telegram to Zhao Guangyue, the director of the health group's office in Jinan, informing him of his travel date and itinerary. (7th)</p>

<h3>Water Conservancy in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Concern for Farmland Water Conservancy, Repair of Dikes and Gates</p>
<p>Sea Dikes are Repaired in Three Sections, and River Channels are Dredged Separately</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is located on the coast. The vein of the Xianxia Mountain comes northwards in several branches until it reaches the sea. The flow of water also changes accordingly. North of the East-West Tianmu Mountains, all rivers flow into Taihu Lake. East of the Kuocang and Tiantai Mountains, all rivers flow into the sea. The Qiantang River is north of the Xianxia Mountains, east of the Yellow Mountains, and west of the Tiantai and Kuocang Mountains. All rivers converge here. The source is long and the flow is far, and floods occur from time to time. Therefore, the water conservancy authorities regard the construction of sea dikes and the management of riverbeds in the lower reaches of the Tiejiang River as urgent tasks. For three years, in addition to paying attention to the water conservancy of the Qiantang River, the authorities have also repaired and dredged river channels in various counties, built dikes, gates, and weirs, and managed lakes and marshes. The details are described below.</p>
<h3>Construction of Sea Dikes</h3>
<p>The Qiantang River sea dike is on the north bank, starting from Shangsi Township and ending at Dushan, Pinghu, with a length of 201 kilometers, and the Jiang Dike is 42 kilometers long, passing through Hangzhou, Haining, Haiyan, and Pinghu. On the south bank, it starts from Linpu of Puyang River and ends at Cao'e Town of Cao'e River, with a total length of 90 kilometers for the sea dike and the Jiang Dike. This more than 300-kilometer-long Jianghai Dike is divided into three sections: Hanghai, Yanping, and Shaoxiao, each with a construction office in Haining, Haiyan, and Shaoxing, directly under the Water Conservancy Bureau. For three years, the total cost of annual repairs, monthly repairs, and emergency repairs for the three sections has reached 776,391.407 yuan. The Hanghai section accounted for 516,740.697 yuan, including 151,650.282 yuan in the 19th year, 263,065.705 yuan in the 20th year, and 1,020,224.710 yuan in the 21st year, with an average of 172,246.899 yuan per year. The Yanping section accounted for 76,463.062 yuan, including 38,218.300 yuan in the 19th year, 9,192.592 yuan in the 20th year, and 29,052.170 yuan in the 21st year, with an average of 25,487.687 yuan per year. The Shaoxiao section accounted for 183,187.648 yuan, including 103,921.590 yuan in the 19th year, 16,885.518 yuan in the 20th year, and 62,380.540 yuan in the 21st year, with an average of 61,062.249 yuan per year. The annual repair project includes the cost of demolishing and building dangerous dikes and embedding stone dikes, 264,486.399 yuan for the Hanghai section, 108,668.724 yuan for mud filling, 73,004.054 yuan for attaching soil, 9,640.338 yuan for rubble revetment, and 4,350.600 yuan for water carrying, for a total cost of 460,150.015 silver dollars. The Yanping section cost 6,784.930 yuan for demolishing and building dangerous dikes and embedding stone dikes, 15,554.199 yuan for mud filling, 21,468.25 yuan for attaching soil, 25,257.096 yuan for stone dike cement grouting and leak repair, and dike foundation pile driving, and 13,754.057 yuan for stone slope revetment, for a total cost of 82,819.107 silver dollars. The Shaoxiao section cost 23,026.519 yuan for mud filling, 29,186.654 yuan for attaching soil, 58,430.970 yuan for stone gate grouting and grouting machine, 45,011.758 yuan for rubble protection, 32,931.920 yuan for water carrying, and 2,413.072 yuan for culvert, for a total cost of 191,000.893 silver dollars. The total engineering cost of the three sections in the past four years is 733,970.015 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dredging Rivers and Harbors</h3>
<p>The rivers and harbors of various counties are mostly silted up due to years of disrepair. The riverbeds and harbor channels are increasingly blocked, harming both water conservancy and transportation. Over the past three years, the authorities have exerted great efforts to dredge them. The completed projects include: Jiapu Harbor in Changxing, costing over 17,950 yuan; Fuyuan Harbor in Changxing, costing over 14,000 yuan; Luqi Harbor in Changxing, costing over 12,000 yuan; Huaqiao Harbor in Changxing, costing over 10,800 yuan; Meixi Wangjing Bay in Anji, costing over 34,900 yuan; and fifteen sections of the Tang River in Haiyan, costing over 24,900 yuan (all of the above commenced construction in the 19th year). Others include: Daixi Shangxia Shen Irrigation in Wuxing, costing over 28,000 yuan; the Changhu River course, costing over 25,900 yuan (the above two commenced construction in the 20th year); the Chengnan River course in Tongxiang, costing over 28,900 yuan; and the Si’an and other harbors in Haining, costing over 900 yuan (the above two commenced construction in the 21st year). Additionally, there is the Xiguan River in Huangyan, costing over 11,800 yuan, which was surveyed and constructed by the West River Sluice Gate Engineering Office.</p>
<p>The projects still under construction include: Jifang Harbor in Wuxing, which has already cost over 165,000 yuan; Shitang Harbor in Wuchang, which has already cost over 7,300 yuan; and the river course from Wuliqiao to Qingheqiao in Changxing, which has already cost over 13,000 yuan. The project that has been surveyed and is currently being planned is the dredging of the West Tiaoxi River.</p>
<h3>Repairing Dikes and Embankments</h3>
<p>The dikes and embankments of various counties have always been highly valued. In the 20th year, many were breached by floods. The projects that have now been completed include: the West Xian Dike and the Yongtai Township Xian Dike in Hang County (constructed independently by the county); the Longwang Pond in Yuhang and Lin’an, costing over 3,000 yuan; the Tiaoxi Xian Dike in Yuhang, costing over 11,000 yuan; the Wukang Xian Dike, costing over 8,500 yuan; the Shierli Dike in Deqing, costing over 14,700 yuan; the Siru Village Embankment in Anji, costing over 3,100 yuan; and the Dongshan Village Embankment in Xiaofeng, costing over 14,400 yuan (all of the above commenced construction in the 20th year). Others include: the Xujiazhuang Dike in Xiaofeng, costing over 22,900 yuan (commenced construction in the 21st year). The smaller dike projects in various counties are omitted for brevity.</p>
<h3>Sluice Gates and Weirs</h3>
<p>The sluice gates and weirs in various counties are mostly the gateways for water storage and drainage, and are of great importance to farmland irrigation. If they are found to be collapsing, they should be repaired immediately. The projects that the authorities have repaired include: the Sanjiang Sluice Gate in Shaoxing, which commenced construction in October of last year and was completed in April of this year, costing over 31,300 yuan; the construction of the West River Sluice Gate in Huangyan, which commenced construction in October of the 20th year and was completed in June of this year, costing over 80,000 yuan; the construction of the Xinjinqing Sluice Gate in Wenling, which commenced construction in October of last year and has already cost over 273,000 yuan, with completion scheduled for March of next year; and the construction of the Deqing Weir in Hang County, costing over 21,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Managing Lakes and Marshes</h3>
<p>Lakes and marshes are related to farmland irrigation. Those that have been silted up for years should be repaired urgently to benefit cultivation and drainage. However, the villagers have limited knowledge and rely heavily on the leadership of the authorities. Many lakes and marshes in Yuhang are silted up. Beihu, located at the confluence of the North, Central, and South Tiaoxi Rivers, has been silted up for years due to disrepair, forming a flat land. Powerful people have encroached upon it, filling the land to cultivate mulberry and bamboo. The authorities have established a cleanup committee to manage it. Nanhu in Yuhang, which serves as a storage area for the South Tiaoxi River, has been allocated 149,000 yuan in disaster relief bonds, and the county has been instructed to plan its dredging. It is also planned to establish a brick and tile factory to test the production of Western-style bricks to handle the accumulated soil. Renhu, located ten li northeast of Fenghua County, is surrounded by mountains on three sides. A dike was built on the north side during the Song Dynasty for storage and drainage. Due to years of disrepair, it is no longer able to store and drain water. The Construction Department has instructed the Water Conservancy Bureau to investigate and instruct the county to handle it. Dongqian Lake in Yin County is related to the water conservancy of Yin, Feng, and Zhen Counties. The Water Conservancy Bureau has already organized a survey team to measure it. The Construction Department also plans to establish a water conservancy model area in Zhuji Baita Lake to promote it, with a budgeted cost of 139,000 yuan, and the Water Conservancy Bureau has already sent a team to measure it.</p>

<h3>Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Quarrel, Report to the Bureau and Sue Each Other</h3>
<p>Xue Jingxin, a resident of Sijiangjiao, is a student at a certain university in Shanghai. He married Zhang Bolan’s daughter, Shunrong, some years ago. They were quite harmonious when they first got married. Later, it was heard that Jingxin was in Shanghai, using his studies as a pretext, and became acquainted with a woman surnamed *So and So*. Their love was intense. When Shunrong found out, she went to the school to look for him, but could not find him. She returned and told her mother-in-law, Madam Yang, who sided with her son. As a result, a rift developed between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Jingxin did not return home for a long time, and his whereabouts were unknown. When asked, his mother-in-law also knew nothing. Quarrels were inevitable. His mother-in-law, Madam Yang, could not stand her daughter-in-law’s nagging and left home to live with relatives to avoid the trouble. Yesterday, Madam Yang happened to return home, and she and her daughter-in-law first argued and then wrestled with each other. Zhang Shunrong injured her wrist and reported the matter to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. The Bureau, considering that both parties were respectable women and that they were related as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and that it was inappropriate to sue each other, ordered them to return home for reconciliation and restore the family’s natural relationship. It is said that the ill feelings between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are deep, and the key to resolving the problem lies in Jingxin’s explanation, which may be able to settle the dispute.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order Cancels the Two Yuan Additional Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The tax burden in Jiangsu Province is the heaviest in the country. Previously, due to insufficient provincial revenue after the war, starting in the sixteenth year, the tax was limited to five yuan per *shi*, and an additional two yuan per *shi* was levied for grain tax. Orders were issued to the subordinate departments to handle the matter, and various county public associations repeatedly telegraphed the province, requesting the cancellation of the additional grain tax to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. This year, due to the disastrous drop in rice prices, the rural economy has been extremely depressed, and the people are even more unable to bear the burden. The provincial government, in order to show compassion for the people’s difficulties, has ordered the cancellation. After receiving the order, this county has announced it to the public.</p>

<h3>New Appointment of the Chief of the Wujiang Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Zhang Nancun, the chief inspector of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, has been ordered to be transferred to the position of chief of the Wujiang County Public Security Bureau. After receiving the appointment, Zhang went to Wujiang County yesterday to take office. Xu Jiarui has been appointed as the chief inspector of the Wujiang Public Security Bureau. The replacement for Zhang’s vacancy is still being sought.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Forced Donations in the Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>The county government built a vegetable market in Xilikudifang and contracted the vegetable donation to a merchant, who paid 75 yuan per month. Yesterday (the 8th), the Public Security Bureau dispatched police to order all vegetable vendors and stalls in the Daoqian Street and Yangyu Lane area to move to the vegetable market to do business. However, the vegetable vendors complained that the vegetable market levied a large amount of vegetable donation, requiring three yuan per load per month, and requiring payment in advance for three months, so they withdrew one after another. The police precinct tried to dissuade them to no avail, and the enforcement was also ineffective. The shops in the Yangyu Lane area felt that the donation contractor in the vegetable market was oppressing the vendors and felt indignant. They jointly submitted a public letter to the county government, requesting it to stop the practice. If the authorities insisted on their own way, they would close the market to show their determination.</p>

<h3>Change of Trial Officers</h3>
<p>The county’s judicial system handles many civil and criminal lawsuits. The High Court has appointed Huang Jieliang and Liang Xuan as trial officers to handle the cases on a daily basis. However, due to the large number of lawsuits, they could not handle them all, resulting in a backlog of three to four hundred cases in recent years. Therefore, Chen Zonggao was additionally assigned as a trial officer to Changshu last month, specializing in clearing the backlog of cases, so he has been extremely busy these days. However, now that Huang Jie and Chen Zonggao need to go to Beijing to take the higher examinations, they have specially requested a one-month leave from the High Court. It is said that it has been approved, and Guo Weiran has been appointed as a trial officer to Changshu to succeed them.</p>

<h3>Police Robbery of a Pharmacy: A Shocking Incident</h3>
<p>At 11 p.m. on the 4th, four robbers came to the Tianyitang Pharmacy in Shigangmen, pretending to buy medicine to open the door. One person stood guard outside, while three entered the room, brandishing box cannons and pistols, warning the occupants not to make any noise. They searched the store and the bedroom, stealing over one hundred yuan in cash and six pieces of gold jewelry. The robbers then took the loot and headed north. The owner, Yan Jingdong, secretly followed them to the South Gate. The robbers shouted to open the gate to enter the city, but Yan was stopped by the gate guards and could not enter. The next morning, Gao Baozhen, the captain of the county police team, and Ye Zhenglong, a detective, learned that Zhao Yuhuan, a dismissed police officer, was suspected of being involved in the case. After detaining and interrogating him, Zhao confessed that he had committed the crime together with Bao Dexin and Tao Bingqing, current police officers of the County Public Security Bureau. Bao and Tao were on duty outside. The County Public Security Bureau immediately arrested them. After being identified by the victim, Yan Jingdong, they were found to be carrying a fake pistol. Bao and others, unable to deny the charges, confessed that they were instructed by Chen Dingji, a graduate of the Bao'an Tuan training class and a resident of Shigangmen. Chen Dingji and other suspects, Mao Chengrong, a Shigangmen resident, and Zhang Zongquan, a Malu resident, who were also graduates of the Bao'an Tuan training class, were arrested at the Nanxiang Railway Station and taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Three Murder Cases Reported for Investigation</h3>
<p>In the Panjiali area of the second district (Jingyun City) near Zhoujing Port, Pan A’da, a villager, had a quarrel with his rebellious son, Fengxiang, on the first day of this month, which resulted in him being beaten and hitting a vital spot. He died on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival. The rebellious son, Fengxiang, fled after realizing that he had caused trouble. The township head, Hua Lunxiang, considered it a murder case and strictly pursued the murderer. He was captured yesterday and taken to the district office for custody. He also ordered the *tu* head to report the case to the County Court for investigation.</p>
<p>In addition, Gao Tangshi, the wife of Xu A’gen, a villager from Tangxu Lane, 35 *tu*, near Siling in the fifth district, suffered from a severe typhoid fever. She was treated by a female witch, Xu, from Wuxiang, who used spells and tied her hands and feet with hemp ropes, resulting in her death. Her body was found in the Zhangxun Temple. Yesterday, the *tu* head, Pan Shaoji, together with the deceased’s biological mother, Gao Tangshi, and aunt, Xu Zhushi, came to the city to report to the court for investigation. The prosecutor and the coroner Wang went to the village to investigate. They found rope marks on the hands and feet of the deceased, Xu Gaoshi, indicating that she had been killed by the female witch using evil spells after she fell ill. After the investigation, they instructed the family to prepare a coffin and bury the body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Jin A’gen (over fifty years old), a fisherman from Tangkoumen, Xujiabian, Yangming Township, in the third district, was fierce by nature. On the night of the twelfth day of the sixth lunar month of this year, he used ropes to tie up his adopted daughter, Li, and carried her to a pit dug beside the tomb of Wang Jinsan’s ancestors, the deputy township head of Henan, near Tanghu Lake. He buried her alive. Because she cried for help, she had four of her front teeth knocked out, resulting in her tragic death. Recently, someone catching crickets discovered the body. Jin A’gen, realizing that things were going badly for him, immediately used the power of money to settle the matter privately. However, the *tu* head, Su Shifa, of Nian 63 *tu*, concealed the case and did not report it. It is hoped that the judicial authorities will investigate the matter so that the injustice can be redressed.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Deceptive Price Reductions in Various Industries</h3>

Rewards and punishments will be handled in accordance with the regulations on assessing the performance of the chief of the Public Security Bureau in investigating and arresting thieves.</p>
<p>2.  It was found that a number of Western medicine doctors in Xidi had not yet submitted applications for registration to the Health Department. The branch bureaus and offices should investigate and urge them to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations for doctors.</p>
<p>3.  The trend of large-scale price reductions in various industries in the city is very strong, but after investigation, many of them are deceptive. The County Chamber of Commerce should be notified to correct them. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Jiaxing</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Strictly Pursues Old Taxes</h3>
<p>The amount of old taxes owed by the people of Jiaxing is indeed large, but years of famine and the bankruptcy of the rural economy are major reasons. Unexpectedly, the provincial government, without considering the people’s difficulties, specially sent Shen Tai, a member of the committee to collect old taxes, to Jiaxing to supervise the collection and set a deadline for the collection of the proportional amount. At the same time, a member was hired from a certain county to establish an evaluation committee for collecting old taxes. It is now learned that the committee has decided that all those who owe more than one hundred yuan in taxes will be reported by the heads of the Jiaxiu to the finance bureau, along with their clear account holders and real addresses, and the police will be instructed to pursue the collection. If they continue to delay, they will be detained and their property will be confiscated and strictly pursued.</p>

The woman was identified as Hu Nonglin, about the same age as Hu, from Hangzhou, and was also a student in Shanghai. It is said that the reason for their suicide was that Hu had already married a wife at home, but wanted to love Hu in Shanghai. The families on both sides were also very stubborn, and they knew that there was no way to resolve the situation, so they committed suicide by drowning themselves in the sea.</p>

<h3>Baoshan Seawall is in Danger</h3>

<p>The Baoshan seawall protects the lives and property of more than ten counties along the coast, and is of great importance. In the Qing Dynasty, it once collapsed, and the flood rushed to the Suzhou-Wuxi area. Hu Renji, the magistrate of Baoshan County, went bankrupt and donated his salary to build the seawall.

<h3>Customs Treasury Bills Pledge Proceeding</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Finance Minister Song Ziwen previously requested and was approved to issue 100 million yuan of treasury bills to provide relief due to financial difficulties. According to news from banking circles in this city, during the tense military situation in North China, due to the emptiness of the national treasury and huge expenditures, 50 to 60 million yuan was temporarily borrowed from banking circles in this city. This loan was of a temporary advance nature. Therefore, after Cai Song returned to China, he requested the issuance of 100 million yuan of customs treasury bills to repay this debt. The treasury bills can be used as cash collateral. After the 100 million treasury bills were used to deduct the advance from the previous banking circles, there are still 40 to 50 million yuan, which will be borrowed from banking circles without any discount. Although there is no definite indication from banking circles in this city on this matter, it is expected to be decided soon.</p>

<h3>Furlong Silk Factory to Resume Work on the 11th After Strike</h3>
<p>The Furlong Hengji Shuang Gong Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road, Hongkou, has been in a strike since the 6th of this month. Because the workers have not yet announced the reasons for the strike, the trade union and the management have no way to mediate. The day before yesterday, the factory did not resume work because the number of workers was incomplete. Yesterday, very few workers arrived. The factory was afraid that there would still be disputes. Moreover, it was a weekend, so in addition to ordering the general manager to inquire the workers, it has been decided that after the Double Ten National Day, the whistle will be blown to resume work from the 11th.</p>

The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>

They were warmly received by Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Gong Yuting, Long Peiyun, and Shao Xubai of the General Labor Union.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>During the meeting, Zhu Xuefan of the General Labor Union reported, stating: "The General Labor Union invited everyone here today. We are very honored. The electricity labor strike is now becoming increasingly serious. At the beginning of this labor strike, the Party and government, the authorities, and the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, Zhong Si, mediated. However, the company's attitude was firm and could not be resolved. Since the power company took over, it has repeatedly dismissed workers, reaching more than 400 people. Looking back on the era of the Public Works Bureau in the past, there were very few dismissals of workers. Now it is different. Workers are often dismissed by the company. Recently, workers Xue Abao and others have been continuously dismissed, which has led to a slowdown in work. Furthermore, the company's firm attitude has led to today's serious situation. As for the workers, they are willing to make concessions in order to prevent the situation from escalating and avoid harming the public interest. However, the company authorities, with a mentality of despising the Chinese, refused to accept. I hope that the leaders of various groups will provide guidance. The General Labor Union is willing to accept with the utmost sincerity and advise the electricity workers to resolve the dispute as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Expressing Opinions</h3>
<p>Subsequently, representatives expressed their opinions on the electricity labor strike. Excerpts are as follows: (Lin Kanghou) stated: "Since this incident occurred, the Chinese directors, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and the Party and government agencies have repeatedly mediated, but the company has relied on its arrogance and has not resolved it. The country is weak. Do we Chinese have any right to speak? In short, the issue is not whether the workers concede on the conditions, but whether the company has the sincerity to accept negotiations. Because the company insists as before, it may be difficult to make concessions again and may not be effective. I believe that our Chinese shares in the electricity company are very large. The Chinese directors should make a strong representation to urge the company to realize the situation. If it is still ineffective, then the Chinese directors and Chinese shareholders should unanimously withdraw from the electricity company in order to protect the interests of Chinese workers." (Wu Zhihao) stated: "The current world is a matter of strength. Without unity, there is no way to survive. Relying solely on others is unreliable. I hope that all groups will unite and provide strong support for the oppressed Chinese workers." Zhang Zikang, Chu Huiseng, Tao Leqin, Zheng Zhengqiu, and others also gave speeches, expressing their full support for the workers.</p>
<p>Municipal Defense Corps Management Committee</p>
<h3>Inspects the City's Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Held at the New City Hall Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Tingrong Personally Inspected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps Management Committee held an inspection of the city's defense corps at the New City Hall in the city center yesterday morning at 9 am, because Mayor Wu inspected the city's police and defense corps during the opening ceremony of the New City Hall in the city center on Double Ten National Day. The chairman of the committee, Mr. Zhang Tingrong, personally attended the inspection. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Participating Teams</h3>
<p>In addition to the chairman of the management committee, Zhang Tingrong, the chief instructor Zhu Yuanhui, the head of the Pengpu District Corps Hou Weichen, the deputy head of the corps Zhou Bulian, and the Wu Yigeng of the Jiangwan District Corps, the participating inspectors included two teams and two platoons from the Hunan District, two teams from the Zhabei District, one team from the Pengpu District Corps, and one platoon from the Yangjing District Corps. Although Jiangwan and Wusong also sent teams to participate, they were all designated as service teams and did not participate in the inspection.</p>
<h3>Inspection Situation</h3>
<p>After 8 am yesterday morning, teams from various districts first went to the city center to assemble and wait for inspection. At 9 am, the chairman of the management committee, Zhang Tingrong, and the chief instructor Zhu Yuanhui, arrived together. It was originally planned to be held at the large parade ground of the New City Hall, but because the ground was not dry due to rain, they immediately moved to the nearby road. First, the teams from various districts formed up separately, and then the chief instructor Zhu commanded the exercise of various column formations. Chairman Zhang inspected and examined the uniforms and firearms. The members of each team showed energetic action and exercises, and their steps were neat. They dispersed at about 11 am.</p>
<h3>Zhang's Speech</h3>
<p>After the inspection, Zhang gave a speech, stating: "The New City Hall is scheduled to be completed on October 10. Mayor Wu will hold a grand inspection ceremony for the city's police and defense corps. Therefore, this association will gather once today to organize teams from various districts. The results of today's inspection show that Pengpu is the most orderly in terms of clothing, followed by Zhabei and Hunan. I hope that we will pay attention to it at all times in the future. Clothing is the most important condition for military appearance. The defense corps is a self-defense organization for the people. I hope that we will encourage more training on weekdays, possess self-defense capabilities, serve the local area, and seek happiness for ourselves."</p>
<h3>US Destroyer Collides with Flagship</h3>
<p>Both are Safe</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the US destroyer USS Pillsbury, along with fifteen other destroyers, passed Shanghai yesterday afternoon on their way south from Yantai and Qingdao, and entered the Huangpu River. When it was about to turn to moor at the pontoon, due to the swift current and avoiding a small boat, the bow of the ship hit the hull of the flagship USS Houston, which was originally moored in the Huangpu River. The bow of the USS Pillsbury was immediately bent and flooded, but the middle and rear compartments were intact and it still sailed to the pontoon on its own. It will now be docked for repairs. The USS Houston has a thick ironclad, and although it was hit on the hull, it suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Association Requests Flexible Unified Tax Change Transportation Certificate</h3>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Industry Association of this city stated that the Unified Tax Office had previously approved the writing of the words "other ports" on the transportation certificate within the scope of the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan to facilitate merchants. Therefore, all members of the association have never applied for a change of transportation certificate for cotton cloth transported from Hankou, Wuxi, Nantong and other places to various ports within the seven provinces. No incidents have occurred for several years. Recently, the cotton cloth shipped to Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, was suddenly found to be detained for not changing the tax bill and being punished according to regulations. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the Unified Tax Office yesterday, requesting to maintain the established case or a flexible solution to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. The original letter is excerpted as follows: Respectfully, according to letters from colleagues in Ningbo, all cotton cloths transported from Hankou, Wuxi, Nantong and other places to Shanghai, whose unified tax transportation certificate originally wrote "other ports," must be changed to a change of transportation certificate from the Shanghai Unified Tax Bureau if they are to be transported to other ports. Recently, there have been many cases of detaining tax certificates that have not been changed in Ningbo, and they must be punished according to regulations. Your office had previously approved that within the scope of the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Henan, you can write "other ports" on the transportation certificate, and it has been unimpeded for many years. However, the cotton cloth transported to Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, this time suddenly has incidents of detaining certificates and punishing them. Merchants were shocked and did not know what to do because the established case for many years was abolished in one day. Moreover, applying for a change of transportation is indeed more difficult. We respectfully submit the following to your office: (1) The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau is located on Chengdu Road in western Shanghai, far away from various cotton cloth firms. It not only takes time to travel back and forth, but also costs money; (2) It takes at least four hours to change a transportation certificate. Each firm must send someone to guard and pick it up, so they have to hire employees to manage it; (3) Merchants buy and sell based on the market price of the day. If the goods cannot be shipped out on the same day, the price will fall the next day, and they will be returned, resulting in losses. This has happened repeatedly. Moreover, the change of transportation tax certificate is only limited to seven days. If it cannot be sold within seven days, you must apply for a change again, resulting in wasted time and money. Our association's responsibilities are in place, and our knowledge is more accurate, so we do not dare to offend and submit the following situation. We sincerely ask your office to consider the difficulties of merchants and allow the maintenance of the established case. All those within the seven provinces area can still write "other ports" tax certificate and be completely unimpeded. In the event that the regulations do not allow approval, please change the method. All cotton cloths transported from Hankou, Wuxi, Nantong and other places to Shanghai for transportation to other ports can indicate "Shanghai transfer to other ports" at the place of origin, avoiding the change of transportation procedures, so as to benefit merchants and facilitate sales. It will be extremely grateful and waiting for orders.</p>

<h3>Party Departments in the Seventh District Request Tax Exemption for Disaster-Stricken Farmers</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of two hurricanes and continuous rain, the agricultural products in the rural areas of this city have suffered huge losses, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Although the Social Affairs Bureau has provided loans, they are a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. The Party Department of the Seventh District of Jiangwan yesterday specially requested the Municipal Party Department to forward the request to the Municipal Government to order its subordinates to inspect the situation in the countryside and assess the severity of the disaster, and to grant appropriate exemptions from field taxes to maintain the people's livelihood and provide relief.</p>
<p>Song Xishang and Potter</p>
<p>Yesterday Reported on the Inspection of the Huanghe Embankment Breach</p>
<p>Song Talks about the Breach Situation and Blocking Methods</p>
<p>A Water Conservancy Expert Conference is Scheduled to Study the Problem</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangxian, director of the labor relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, previously sent Song Xishang, director of the Public Works Department, and Potter, a water conservancy expert sent by the League of Nations to China under the National Economic Council, to inspect the major breaches of the Yellow River in order to plan blocking them. Mr. Song has completed the inspection and returned to Nanjing by train with Mr. Potter the day before yesterday. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and met with Director Zhou Xiangxian to report everything. Director Zhou will go to Beijing tomorrow night. A reporter from the Daily News visited Mr. Song at the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association on the Bund yesterday to ask about the inspection process and the blocking methods. Mr. Song gave a detailed account. He also learned that a meeting of engineering experts is scheduled for next Monday, and the disaster relief group's procurement and transportation team is scheduled to depart today to purchase disaster relief food. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Inspection of the Breach Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. Song first said, "I and Mr. Potter departed from Beijing a few days ago, first to Kaifeng, Henan, then through Zhengzhou, transferred to Hebei, Changyuan, Puyang, along the embankment to Jinan, Shandong, and then returned to Beijing. There are more than forty large and small breaches in the Huanghe embankment, of which there are more than thirty in Hubei Province. The largest breaches are four: (1) Shitou Village, (2) Xiangting, (3) Pang Village, and (4) Tongwaxiang. Among them, the Shitou Village breach has the most severe water flow, with three-fifths of the Yellow River water entering from this opening. The second is the Xiangting Shao opening, which is the longest, and the water flow is slower. I and Mr. Potter have come to Shanghai to meet with Director Zhou to report on the progress of this trip and the engineering progress."</p>
<h3>The Blocking Plan Must Seek Speed</h3>
<p>The current blocking plan must seek speed to implement. However, blocking requires a large amount of money, and purchasing and transporting materials is not easy. The current first step is to treat the symptoms. The mouth method is to first use "hanging willows" outside the embankments of each breach to reduce the inflow of water, and then excavate "diversion canals" in the breach to divert water out, and then blocking the breach will be easier to start. In addition to the adoption of "hanging willows" in the first step, which has been negotiated by the Hebei River Affairs Bureau to be responsible for handling, it is reported that in the next two or three days, it is planned to invite water conservancy experts to hold a meeting to discuss specific methods, or to set up an engineering expert committee to be responsible for research.</p>
<h3>The Suffering of the Stranded Victims is Tragic</h3>
<p>Mr. Song said at the end, "The houses of the victims in the Yellow River basin have been destroyed by water, and those who have no home to return to are sleeping in the open air. Most of them are sick, with diseases such as [swollen feet] and [abdominal pain], which is tragic. I will visit Mr. Liu Ruiheng, the director of the sanitation group, to inform him of the current situation and ask him to immediately find a way to rescue them, so as to avoid the starvation of the victims and emphasize humanity and benefit the victims."</p>
<h3>Scheduled Call</h3>
<p>The reporter further inquired about the progress of the organization of the Engineering Expert Committee. According to the answer, the Labor Relief Group, in order to facilitate the completion of the project as soon as possible, in addition to setting up an engineering office in each of the three provinces of Lu, Yu, and Ji to handle engineering administration matters, specially organized an Engineering Expert Committee to preside over engineering design matters. All members, such as Stoke, Potter, Blanc, Song Xishang, and Yang Tingyu, are Chinese and foreign engineering experts. It has now been scheduled to hold the first meeting in Beijing next Monday (the 16th) to discuss all engineering plans, such as dredging and blocking the mouth. Director Zhou Xiangxian is scheduled to take the night train with me (that is, last night) to return to Beijing to handle important public affairs of the Yangtze River Rectification Committee.</p>
<h3>Procurement and Transportation Personnel Depart Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The reporter then learned that the head of the procurement and transportation team of the Disaster Relief Group is also the deputy director of the Nanjing Lizhi Society, Gao Daxing. Mr. Gao was responsible for procurement and transportation work during the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China. This time, he took over the position and was familiar with it. Now Mr. Gao has planned the procurement of various relief supplies, and the funds have also been requested from the Ministry of Finance for the first batch of 440,000 yuan to facilitate the purchase. All personnel are scheduled to depart tomorrow and go to major ports in Henan, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Jinan and Jining in Shandong, and Tianjin and Zhangde in Hebei to purchase relief food, seeds, etc. The first batch of 20,000 sets of cotton clothing is scheduled to be shipped to the disaster area in Yu Province on the 15th.</p>
<h3>All Circles in Qinhuangdao Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>Bandit Troubles are Severe and the Refugees are in a Miserable State</p>
<p>The Relief Association's Ping Branch is Investigating and Handling</p>
<p>The United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations in this city for Northeast Refugees received a telegram from the Joint Association of Yongqi Farmers and Businessmen in Qinhuangdao yesterday, requesting relief. The text reads: "To the United Relief Association of Charitable Organizations for Northeast Refugees in the Renji Shantang, Yunnan Road, Shanghai: The bandit troubles in Luandong are severe, and the refugees are extremely miserable. We hope that you will quickly allocate a large amount of money and wire it to your office in Ping for relief. We are grateful. Yongqi Farmers and Businessmen Joint Association Yu Yin." It is reported that in addition to answering the telegram, the Refugees Association will also send two directors, Qu (Liuwen) and Feng (Yangshan), from the Ping office to investigate and handle.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Foreign Righteous Relief Association Sends Relief Rice to Chongming Again</h3>
<p>Chongming has suffered two hurricanes, and sea tides have directly flooded the area, causing extremely severe disasters. The land is full of cries, and food is as precious as rare treasures. The Sino-Foreign Righteous Relief Association has successively loaded more than one thousand eight hundred shih of relief rice to urgently save the lives of disaster victims. However, the number of people is too large, and it is not enough to distribute. It is reported that another batch of relief rice will be loaded by the Tiansi Ship on Tuesday of this week, and it is also planned to purchase a large number of corn cobs nearby for concurrent distribution. Unfortunately, the weather is gradually getting colder, and most of the disaster victims are in the water-surrounded area. Not only is food cut off, but also clothing is completely absent. It is necessary to gather the strength of the group to provide continuous relief. It is truly not enough to save this remnant of survivors.</p>
<p>The Capital People's Education Museum, etc. Plans to Set Up</p>
<h3>A National Goods vs. Enemy Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>Please Invite National Goods Groups in This City</p>
<p>To Solicit Samples from Various Factories</p>
<p>In order to promote national goods, boycott enemy goods, and make it easier for the public to identify them, the Anti-Japanese Association of all circles in the capital and the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing People's Education Museum have specially set up a national goods vs. enemy goods sample comparison exhibition. They have specially asked national goods groups in this city to solicit samples from various factories on their behalf. It is reported that the Machinery Industry Federation has specially notified various member factory introductions yesterday. Respectfully, we recently received a joint letter from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of all circles in the capital and the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing People's Education Museum. It says, "Resisting Japan and defending against insults is the natural duty of the people, and the people's weapon is only to use boycott methods to put the Japanese to death. However, the public is difficult to identify enemy goods and often has a feeling of mixing fish eyes with pearls. As a result, although the advocates are tired and tongue-tied, the sales of enemy goods have not decreased slightly. Our associations and others have seen this and plan to set up a national goods vs. enemy goods sample comparison exhibition hall, and at the same time hold a national goods promotion campaign, so that the general public can easily identify the quality of enemy goods and know that the same national goods can be used as substitutes. It can not only achieve the purpose of resisting goods, but also make a large-scale promotion for national goods. It is truly a win-win situation. However, the collection of national goods samples is贵在detailed. Our associations and others will collect them ourselves, and there will be regrets every month. We specially write to your association and ask you to collect various samples and their descriptions from national goods factories on our behalf and send them before the beginning of October for display and public viewing." We checked that weapons and defense are the national defense of soldiers, and promoting production is the beginning of advocating strength. My country's production is backward, so foreign insults are frequent. In this autumn when national goods and enemy goods are mixed and difficult to distinguish, it is urgent to set a unique banner so that the Chinese people can recognize them. It is the most urgent task now. We should transfer it to your factory for reference and compliance. If there are many items and it is inconvenient to mail them, you can send a letter directly to the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing People's Education Museum (Nanjing Park Road) and ask them to send someone to collect them.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Citizens' Association Investigates Printing and Dyeing Products</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' First District Branch and the Nanjing Road Business Association wanted to know the truth about the products of Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company. They sent letters to the Shanghai Machinery Industry Federation and the National Goods Factory Federation to inquire so as to inform the members. However, the two associations have not yet given a definite reply. It has now been decided by the regular meeting to send another letter for detailed news.</p>
<h3>Change to Postal Inspection System</h3>
<p>The General Directorate intends to submit a proposal to the Ministry for review. The country's postal districts are divided into northern, central, and southern sections.</p>
<p>Our country's postal inspection system originally stipulated that the Deputy Director-General, along with inspectors, would go to various regions for inspection to carry out rectification. Later, with the promulgation of the Postal General Office Organization Law in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the position of Deputy Director-General was abolished due to the lack of such a provision. It was then changed to Postal Inspector General, whose duty was limited to inspecting bureau affairs, not accounting matters. It is now learned that, due to changing circumstances, the Ministry of Communications believes the original system is no longer applicable and ordered the General Directorate of Posts to revise it. The Directorate has drafted five changes to the postal inspection system and submitted them to the Ministry for review. The main points are as follows: (A) The position of Postal Inspector General will remain and the name will not be changed. (B) Under the Inspector General, there will be two to four inspectors appointed by the Postal Director. (C) The Inspector General, under the direction of the Director-General, will be responsible for inspecting and investigating the postal and accounting affairs of all postal district administrations and first-class offices nationwide, investigating important cases, and assigning alternating supervisors to various administrations and first-class offices. (D) Inspectors and Deputy Inspectors will assist the Inspector General in handling the aforementioned matters under the Inspector General's direction. (E) To ensure timely supervision and quick case handling, the country's postal districts will be divided into central, northern, and southern inspection areas. Each inspector may be stationed in important locations on a regular basis, as needed, for convenient handling.</p>
<p>Gauze Exchange Brokers Association</p>
<h3>Strictly Enforce Exchange Regulations</h3>
<p>Retroactive from March 1, 1931</p>
<p>A reward of two thousand taels for reliable reports</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Gauze Exchange Brokers Association, in order to implement the Exchange Law and its implementing regulations, issued another notice to all members yesterday, requiring strict compliance. The original text is excerpted as follows: The association, to facilitate the implementation of the Exchange Law and its implementing regulations, convened a general meeting of all members on December 25th of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), resolving that from January 1st of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), all members (i.e., brokers) must record all transactions in their accounts without any omissions. The notification must be stamped and certified by the Exchange to be valid. The provisions of Article 38 of the Exchange Law and Article 29 of the implementing regulations should uphold the legislative intent of the government and should be strictly followed. Since March 1st of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), if any member of the Association discovers a violation of the foregoing and the client provides conclusive evidence to report to the Association, in addition to the Exchange handling it according to law, the Association will award a reward of two thousand taels, as stipulated in the agreement jointly established by the Exchange, the Association, and all members on February 11th of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), to the first person to report. If there are two or more reporters, the reward will go to the first person to report. If they report at the same time, the reward will go to the one who provides more conclusive evidence. If the evidence submitted is deemed equally conclusive by the Association, the reward will be divided equally among the reporters.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Compatriots Discussed Land Surveying Conference of Eight Counties Yesterday</h3>
<p>Organizing a Land Surveying Research Group</p>
<p>Sending Representatives to Beijing and Hangzhou to Petition</p>
<p>Various Zhejiang organizations in Shanghai held a discussion on land surveying in Jiaxing, Pinghu, Changxing, Yuyao, Haining, Haiyan, Xiaoshan, and Huzhou (eight counties in Zhejiang Province) at the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association on the fourth floor at 3:00 PM yesterday. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>Including Lu Zhinan, Xu Xiajun, and Zheng Wentong from the Shaoxing Fellow-Villagers Association; Sun Jixu from Shangyu County; Wang Shuyu and Fang Sungu from Huangyan County; Chu Huiseng, Mao Zuofeng, and Shen Junru from the Zhejiang Association; Qiu Peihao from the Lake Society; Jiang Zhongquan and Wang Shuxiang from Jiaxing; Zhang Zhangzhai and Yan Shuizhuang Yuqing from Dinghai; Zhang Shenzhi from the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association; Xu Xiajun from the Yuyao Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai; Zheng Yuzhou and Yao Yamei from Shaoxing; Zhu Xufu from Taizhou; Xu Dafu from Wenzhou Ruian; Chen Minggao from the Fenghua Fellow-Villagers Association, and others.</p>
<h3>Reporting Matters</h3>
<p>Zhang Shenzhi of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association was elected as chairman. Chu Huiseng of the Zhejiang Association reported on: (1) A telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government; (2) A letter from the Lake Society recommending Yu Zhongxian and Qiu Peihao as representatives; (3) The Yuyao Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai recommended Xu Xiajun as a representative. Chu Huiseng then gave a supplementary report on the reasons for the meeting and letters from Luo Baoyan, Wang Siyu, Du Shishi, Zha Shuxiang, Zhou Bowei, and others.</p>
<h3>Discussed Proposals</h3>
<p>Chu Huiseng proposed that, to save expenses, if the methods of military triangulation or plane surveying were slightly different, should the financial issues be discussed first, and then the methods? Mao Zuofeng agreed with Du Shihua's proposal that the government should use 2 million yuan to start with one county, and allocate land reporting fees. Xu Xiajun also agreed with this method. Zha Duxiang said that the fees collected should be consolidated. In Jiaxing, with over 1.3 million mu of land, there was an extra levy of over 70,000. Chu Huiseng proposed sending representatives to Beijing and the province to petition for the suspension of land surveying fees in various counties. Sun Jixu advocated plane surveying, using natural rivers as boundaries, and using surveying methods to first oppose large-scale triangulation and oppose the collection of surveying fees, and then send representatives to petition. Shen Hengshan proposed first telegraphing the provincial government to stop collecting surveying fees, which was unanimously approved. Chu Huiseng proposed organizing a research group. Sun Jixu proposed that large-scale triangulation be supervised by central land surveying officials and local gentry, and that surveying be for the purpose of reorganizing taxes and consolidating people's property rights, and that its effect would be the same as the land survey in Tongxiang.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>It was resolved to telegraph the provincial government and recommend Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhuang Songfu, Xu Xiajun, and Chu Huiseng as representatives to petition in Hangzhou. Chen Aishi, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Yongni, Wang Xiaolai, and Chu Huiseng were recommended as representatives to petition in Beijing. Shou Xiaotian and Sun Jixu were appointed to preside over the research of land surveying matters. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<h3>Vast Wasteland in the Lianghuai Salt Area</h3>
<p>Totaling over 13 million mu</p>
<p>Successful cultivation can generate 100 million yuan annually</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen previously noted that the wasteland in the Lianghuai salt area was quite extensive. If it were cultivated, it would benefit both the livelihood of farmers and national tax revenue. He specifically proposed the cultivation of the Lianghuai salt area, which was approved by the Executive Yuan. The proposed plan was transferred to the Ministry of Finance to be handled jointly with the National Economic Council. According to those familiar with the Lianghuai salt area, since the founding of the Republic, many reclamation companies have been established in northern Jiangsu, but due to limited economic resources, they have not achieved significant development. The counties in the Jiangbei reclamation area have approximately 13 million mu of wasteland. If substantial capital were gathered and scientific methods were used for development, it could become cotton fields, generating an annual income of 100 million yuan. At the same time, it could provide a livelihood for 2.5 million farmers. It is truly a great undertaking with two benefits. It is reported that the National Economic Council is currently studying the drafted plan to implement it as soon as possible. (New News Agency)</p>

<p>(Shen Bao Third Edition)</p>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Yesterday Morning</p>
<h3>Uncovered a Red Pill Manufacturing Operation in Liuhe</h3>
<p>Drug Manufacturers Dared to Open Fire and Resist Arrest</p>
<p>Gunfire as Dense as Linked Pearls, Residents Panicked</p>
<p>Eight People Arrested, Along with Morphine and Firearms</p>
<p>It was reported that someone had set up a red pill manufacturing operation in the Qiujia house in the Beishi area of Liuhe Town, Taicang County, and that it had been moved three times. The house was not very large, with only four or five families living there. Behind the house was water. The house rented by someone surnamed Zhang was a five-room bungalow and was currently being used as a drug manufacturing operation. This was learned by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Yesterday morning, a platoon of military police, about thirty people, armed with Mauser pistols, etc., rushed to the town by car. It was about four o'clock in the morning, and most of the residents had not yet gotten up. The troops headed to their destination, but were detected by the sentries of the drug manufacturing operation, who immediately reported it. The group came out to resist, and both sides opened fire. For a while, rifles, Mauser pistols, etc., were exchanged. The residents did not know what was going on and were very frightened. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, the personnel of the drug manufacturing operation, realizing they were no match, all fled into the water behind the house. Eight people were later captured by the military police. The operation contained a large amount of morphine and other raw materials for manufacturing drugs. They were ordered to speed up the manufacturing of the remaining raw materials, and the outside was guarded by military police, preventing anyone from entering. Therefore, the case had not yet been brought to Shanghai by the evening. It was also heard that the military police headquarters had prepared two Chinese moving trucks, one armored vehicle, and several other passenger cars, etc., to load the remaining raw materials after they were made into red pills, along with the machinery and firearms seized in the operation, and transport them to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a letter from Taicang, Wen Jiangang, adjutant of the First Regiment of Military Police of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, led informants and over thirty soldiers in three cars to Liuhe on the morning of the 8th. They uncovered a heroin manufacturing operation in the Qiujia house in Fangjia Weir, seizing approximately three boatloads of heroin and drug manufacturing raw materials, motors, and firearms, and arresting six drug manufacturing technicians. The rest escaped. During the raid, the gunfire was as dense as linked pearls, and the villagers were greatly alarmed. According to Adjutant Wen, the main culprit had escaped and must be apprehended.</p>

<h3>An Anonymous Letter Hurts Others and Hurts Oneself</h3>
<p>Pharmacy Owner Framed a Police Officer Out of Spite</p>
<p>After Investigation, Handed Over to the General Bureau for Review</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau recently received a document mailed by someone using the name Tao Wenbin, accusing Wang Changru, a police officer from the Qichangzhan Police Station in Pudong's Third District, of associating with gangsters, privately transporting opium and morphine, and harassing women. The document requested an investigation. Director Wen, based on the report, considered the matter to involve police reputation and immediately instructed Zhang Mingqin, the District Chief of the Third District, to investigate the matter. District Chief Zhang, upon receiving the order, believed that the police officer had only been on duty for less than a month and would not be so recklessly lawless. Moreover, the original reporter did not have a definite address, so it was suspected that it was a malicious accusation. Therefore, he secretly interrogated the police officer in the district, asking if he had any enemies. After thinking for a long time, Officer Wang said that there was a Wanchuntang pharmacy in Qichangzhan, whose owner was named Han Qinzhou and also practiced medicine. He had stopped him twice from urinating arbitrarily in the street, and this may have caused resentment. The District Chief, seeing that there was no sufficient evidence, did not rush to detain Han for interrogation. He instructed Officer Wu, the original patrol officer of Qichangzhan Police Station, to investigate at an opportune moment. Officer Wu suddenly had an idea. He pretended to be unwell and went to Han's door for treatment. Han did not notice anything and, after a brief examination, ordered his apprentice Cai Rongxiang to write a prescription. Officer Wu remained calm, took the prescription to get medicine, and pretended to return to the station to decoct and drink it. He immediately secretly took out the original report and compared the handwriting with the prescription. Sure enough, there was no error. Therefore, he inferred that the report was drafted by Han and written by the apprentice. He sent police to bring Han Qinzhou and his apprentice Cai Rongxiang to the station separately for strict interrogation. According to Han, he was forty-four years old, from Shanghai, and firmly denied fabricating slander out of spite. According to Cai, he was twenty years old, from Tongzhou, and initially denied it firmly, but was then induced and pressured by Officer Wu and completely confessed that the report was drafted by Han and he was asked to write it. Thus, this suspicious case came to light. Officer Wu immediately confronted the two defendants, but Han still denied it because there was no sufficient physical evidence. The officer became even more enraged and sent police to search Han's bedroom. They found a copy of the original report in the drawer and brought it to the station. However, the name signed below was Zhang Linxu. Officer Wu showed it to Han, who blushed and lowered his head without saying a word. Both defendants were sent to the Third District, where District Chief Zhang re-interrogated them. Han admitted that he initially intended to forge the name Zhang Linxu, and later changed it to Chen Wenbin. He did this because he was interfered with by Officer Wang in public, which damaged his face, so he took this action in retaliation. District Chief Zhang believed that Han dared to falsely accuse the police officer of privately transporting opium and harassing women over a minor matter, which was a very ruthless method. He ordered that a document be prepared and transferred to the General Bureau for trial yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Robbery Resulted in Shooting and Injury of the Victim</h3>
<p>Shot in the Waist, Life in Danger</p>
<p>At the Baohe Coal Company in the Wanju Wharf of Limalu Road in Nanshi, three robbers suddenly arrived at 6:00 PM yesterday (the 8th). One robber kept watch outside, and two robbers broke into the accounting room, drew a pistol, and warned them to remain silent. While they were searching and looting, the manager of the company, Qiang Jiuqiu (from Shangyu, 42 years old), planned to take the opportunity to go outside and report to the police. Unexpectedly, he was noticed by the robbers, who immediately pulled the trigger and shot him in the waist. He fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers no longer searched and looted, only taking a few dozen silver dollars from the counter. After the Maojialong Waitan Municipal Public Security Bureau District One Headquarters received a phone report, they sent police to arrest the robbers. However, it had been a long time, and the robbers had disappeared without a trace. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has telegraphed all districts and stations to strictly cooperate in the arrest and bring them to justice.

<h3>Exhibition of an 108,800-Pound Whale</h3>
<p>Enormous, measuring fifty-five feet in length</p>
<p>Special measures for students and designated groups</p>
<p>Whales resemble fish in appearance but are actually mammals. Large ones can be sixty or seventy fathoms long, with flat, broad heads that take up almost a third of their body. Their skin is smooth and thick, containing much fat. Their forelimbs are entirely fat-like, and their hind limbs are flat. Their nostrils are on top, and they surface to breathe, exhaling air that looks like a spray. They live a long time, possibly for hundreds of years. They mostly live in groups in the Pacific Ocean, always traveling in formations led by the largest whale. They are rarely seen by ordinary people; people only know them from books, but due to not being able to observe them in person, there are many misunderstandings. The following two points are particularly common: (1) Ordinary people generally think that whales have little to do with humans, but this is not true. It should be known that the fat under a whale's skin is a raw material for making soap, candles, perfumed oil, etc. Ambergris is especially necessary for expensive cosmetics, and its price is remarkably high, about seventy-eight dollars an ounce. From this point of view, we have many opportunities to come into contact with whale oil. (2) The Old Book of Tang says, "Small thefts are like those of mice and dogs, large ones like whales swallowing and tigers seizing." We often think that whales can swallow anything with their mouths open, but in fact, the opposite is true. Even a raisin can cause them to choke because a whale's throat is no larger than a human fist, so they rely on small fish for food. When a whale opens its mouth, it can suck in a lot of small fish, which are retained in the baleen in its upper palate. Then, the water is sprayed out, and the fish are gradually swallowed. There is now a giant whale weighing 108,800 pounds on display in the open space next to the Nanjing Grand Theatre. It is said that the transportation cost from the wharf to that location was as high as 1,300 dollars. It is open for viewing from 11:00 AM to midnight, and tickets cost fifty cents. It is heard that in order to treat students favorably, special prices have been set for group visits, which can be arranged by contacting 255 Shandong Road.</p>

<h3>Petty Thugs Rob Elementary School Students of Jewelry</h3>
<p>Two Cases Discovered in Pudong</p>
<p>Recently, some rogue thugs have been using homeless children in their teens, after training them, to specifically rob elementary school students of jewelry. If they are caught, the court does not impose heavy penalties due to their youth, so the number of these small robbers is gradually increasing. It is heard that the organization where these people gather is located in small hotels in the French Concession and moves at any time. The day before yesterday, in the afternoon, Cao Yundi (11 years old), a female student in the first grade of Jingcun Elementary School in Huayuanshi Bridge, Pudong, had her gold earrings snatched by a small thief at the school gate, and her ears were torn, bleeding profusely, and she was frightened and cried. The school teacher learned about it and rushed out to chase the robber, who was caught due to the teacher running faster. He was handed over to the police, who took him to the Third District. After questioning by the district head, he confessed that his name was Xu Qingyao, 15 years old, and that "the boss (the leader who directs the small thieves to rob in various places) sent me to Pudong to rob, but I did not expect to be caught." The district head sentenced him to be sent to court for questioning. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, Wu Liuyu, a male student of the Anglo-American Children's School (only eight years old), was walking in Huayuanshi Bridge with a silver neck ring around his neck, when he was seen by a small thief who lured him to play. Wu was young and ignorant and listened to the small thief, closing his eyes because he thought there was something strange. The small thug saw that the opportunity had come and took off the silver ring and ran away. Wu opened his eyes when he felt the touch and saw him running away with the ring, and he chased after him crying. Fortunately, the police caught the small thief in front. However, the silver ring was nowhere to be found, so they took him to the Third District. After questioning, he confessed that his name was Chen Ayun, 14 years old, from Ningbo, and admitted that the boss was also in a small hotel in the French Concession. He was sentenced to be sent to court for questioning. Director Zhang believes that these kinds of small thugs are discovered from time to time, which is extremely harmful to local public safety, so he instructed all the senior police officers to pay attention to arresting them at any time.</p>
<h3>A Butcher Shop Accountant is a Robber</h3>
<p>The Stolen Goods Were Found at Meng Linhai's Home</p>
<p>On the night of the last Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, the Hongda Fresh Meat Shop, jointly opened by local Dai Pengxi and others at 881 Route des Soeurs in Zhaojiawan, West Shanghai, was robbed of 1,200 dollars in cash and a hand-drawn certificate issued by the Civil Defense Corps with six bullets while returning from collecting accounts. The robbers opened fire and resisted arrest by police officers from the Sixth District. The case was investigated by Lu Ying, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and Tang Bingxiang and Zhou Wenhai, the criminal investigation foremen stationed in the Sixth District. It was discovered that the robbery was orchestrated by Meng Linhai (22 years old), a native of Changzhou and the accountant of the Hongda Fresh Meat Shop, who had been suspended from his job for some reason in June of this year, who gathered accomplices to commit the robbery. It was also learned that the suspect Meng was hiding at 85 Xin Kang Li, Connaught Road. The information was reported to Captain Lu and Tan Baoshou, the district head in charge, who immediately sent criminal investigators Sun Shucheng and others to investigate. Last night at 8:00 PM, while the officers were in the Hengtai Meat Shop (across from Hongda) at 902 Route des Soeurs, Zhaojiawan, they caught Meng talking and laughing nonchalantly. They immediately arrested him and took him to the district for strict interrogation. The suspect confessed, "On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, I and eight other accomplices who are still at large went to the shop with five pistols. After the robbery, we went to Room 12 of the Kai Xingzhou Hotel on Wuma Road in the Public Concession to divide the loot. I got 50 dollars, and I ask for leniency because I was only responsible for keeping watch." After the interrogation, the officers escorted Meng to his home and found 50 dollars of the original stolen money, which they brought back to the district along with the suspect for prosecution. In addition to submitting a document to the General Bureau yesterday morning to be dealt with according to the law, they also ordered the subordinates to arrest the other suspects at large and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Police Officers to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Xiesheng Lumber Company in Nanshi: Two people suddenly came the day before yesterday, both wearing yellow uniforms and yellow military caps, and went to inquire about the planning of the case, saying that they were police officers from the Water Patrol Team. In one section, they said that protecting the wood rafts in the lumber company was not without labor, and their momentum was fierce. The company immediately reported to the Water Patrol Team, who sent police officers to see these two people, who were found to be impersonating police officers. They were immediately arrested, and a badge of the Anhui Tongxiang Association was found. They were immediately escorted to the team, where one, Chang Jingshan, and Xue Yao, both natives of Anhui, confessed to impersonating police officers to extort money. When asked where the uniforms came from, they replied that they were found in a trash can. Considering that the matter involved fraud and impersonation of the police, they were presented to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the local court yesterday for questioning.</p>
<h3>Two Beggars Die from Red Pill Poisoning</h3>
<p>Yipinli, Zhabei, is located on Baoshan Road. During the January 28 Incident, the houses were all destroyed and used for artillery fire. Those who live in the broken walls and ruins are all beggars from humble origins. These beggars mostly smoke red pills. Passing through that place, one often sees three or four beggars huddled in corners, smoking opium. However, the poison of red pills is unparalleled, and the beggars even swallow the ashes to relieve their addiction. Therefore, there are often deaths from poisoning. Yesterday, two more people died, both around 30 years old, with yellow skin all over their bodies, which was a manifestation of poisoning. The police checked and reported to the Fifth District Police Station, which ordered the local guarantee Yan Liugen to report to the local court for examination. Inspector Cao and others came to the scene to investigate and verified the deaths, and the bodies were collected by a charity organization.</p>

<h3>Factories Ship Large Quantities of Products to Beijing to Participate in Railway Exhibition</h3>
<p>In order to develop industry, the Ministry of Railways held the first National Railway Products Exhibition in Shanghai in May of this year.

<h3>Foreign Paper Sells Well in China</h3>
<p>Annual Loss Reaches Thirty to Forty Million Taels</p>
<p>Establishment of Paper Mill May Slightly Recover Losses</p>
<p>In recent years, cultural undertakings have gradually developed, and the use of paper has also increased day by day. All paper mills in China are limited by economic conditions, are small in scale, produce few goods, and stick to old methods, resulting in poor-quality products. Therefore, foreign goods take the opportunity to be imported in large quantities. According to the Jianghai Customs statistics on foreign paper imports for the three months of April, May, and June of this year, April was more than 2.8 million taels, May was more than 3.1 million taels, and June was more than 2.5 million taels. If calculated on an annual basis, the number is thirty to forty million taels. This huge loss is a major blow to the future of the paper business in China. Recently, the Ministry of Industry is actively preparing to open a large-scale paper mill, and various progress are proceeding smoothly. According to the planned schedule, in the initial stage, it can produce 2.31 million yuan worth of paper annually. After the establishment of the factory, it should be able to recover some of the losses.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco Industry Association recently telegraphed to Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance and Director Xie of the Tax Affairs Department, stating: "We have received a letter from the Nanjing Tobacco Industry Association of our members, stating that since the beginning of this year, the Tax Affairs Department promulgated the regulations for the special tax on local tobacco leaves formulated by the Ministry of Finance, which levies a special tax of 4.15 yuan per 200 jin net weight. This is implemented in seven provinces, and no further tax is levied. At that time, tobacco business groups considered the tax rate to be higher than the public sale fee, and it was levied equally regardless of the grade of tobacco leaves. Therefore, for several months, they have been running around and appealing, but have not been granted any consideration by the authorities. The intention is probably that the decree has been promulgated, and the prestige is involved, so it is not convenient to withdraw the decree. However, the suffering of merchants and people should also be considered. If it is not absolutely necessary, why would they groan without being sick? Now that a long time has passed, tobacco merchants are unable to bear the burden, and business is stagnant. This is not just happening in one place, and farmers have difficulty producing and exporting. A glimmer of hope will also be exhausted because of this. Even in terms of national taxes, I am afraid there will not be any bumper harvest. Thinking of the future, hidden worries are growing. We must summarize several key points that should be changed in the special tax on local tobacco and present them to your association: (1) There are different types of tobacco leaves. The most valuable is smoked tobacco, but most of it is purchased by foreign merchants to manufacture cigarettes. The selling price is several times higher than that of local tobacco. Taxing such disparate types with the same tax rate means that the worst tobacco, even if all its selling price is taxed, would still be far from enough. (2) New systems for tobacco and alcohol were promulgated at the same time. The fixed tax on alcohol lists types and grades clearly, but only tobacco is not graded and taxed equally. Not only is the treatment unfair, but the tax rates set at ordinary times are also contradictory to each other. According to the principles of taxation, it should always be collected at a certain percentage of the value, how can it be so arbitrary and heavy? (3) Initially, the inventory was subject to supplementary taxation, and then the deadline was extended for three months, and it had to be sold out. If the tobacco leaves in the inventory have already been taxed with public sale fees, can merchants predict that they will be sold out by the deadline? It is really impossible to have such assurance. Currently, the national political system has not changed, and the law should not investigate the past. Since it is called inventory, there should naturally be no time limit. (4) This revision of the new system, the order from the department said that the old system was easy to be fraudulent and should be changed. However, the department appointed all the previous bureau staff. Since it is clear that there were all kinds of long-standing malpractices, why has no one been punished so far? It is only an ideal discussion, which is used as an excuse for revision. If it is true, it shows that those who govern the law must also govern the people. (5) The Ministry Order stated that this reform strives for simplicity in procedures and always puts merchants first. If it is as said, wouldn't merchants be very willing? Why are they still calling out endlessly, still clinging to the bad old system, and asking for graded punishment? This shows that the burden is unbearable and there is endless suffering. (6) The new weighing system has been implemented in Beijing, but it is feared that it has not been uniformly changed in all provinces and cities. Tobacco is a bulky commodity, plus the wrapping, the weight is even greater. In the previous public sale period, the weight was fixed and a reduction was given. Currently, the production areas of Anhui and Hubei still use the old scales. If the sales areas suddenly tax according to the municipal scales, it is another burden in addition to the taxes that should be paid, how can merchants bear it? (7) The government loudly promotes national goods, and national tobacco and alcohol should be specially maintained. But they are clearly national tobacco and national alcohol, and they are named local tobacco and local alcohol, which not only inspires the people's contempt, but also affects the tobacco and alcohol business, which is close to destruction. We should request a modification of the names. The above statements are like bones stuck in the throat, and we cannot help but pour them out. Moreover, in this time of commercial decline and rural collapse, in this extreme depression, tobacco leaves are purely domestic products and are only remnants. The government is seeking to relieve them, and it seems that they cannot drain the pond to catch all the fish, so that they all perish. In addition to presenting this to the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce and asking them to forward it, we have specifically presented to your association the reasons for the proposed grading of tobacco leaf tax rates, hoping that your association will take note and forward them to the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Affairs Department, asking for an explanation of the above points as soon as possible, and amending the new regulations for the special tax on local tobacco, and grading the tax to relieve merchants' difficulties, which is for the public good, etc. The meeting found that the points stated by the association were indeed in many ways contradictory to the current tax rate, which does not distinguish between grades. The affiliated associations have repeatedly submitted requests in the case. According to the letter, it is reasonable to telegram again. We hope that you will examine and approve it, and add an explanation to the points stated by the association, and cultivate amending the special tax regulations and grading the tax to show fairness. In addition to sending a telegram separately, we hereby telegram, Yu Xunlu, Chairman of the Shanghai-Ningbo-Suzhou Tobacco Industry Association Federation."</p>
<h3>Ganzi Zhang's Robbery</h3>
<p>Ganzi Zhang, a native of Zhenhai, Ningbo, is in his late thirties and works at the Xin Shengchang Customs Brokerage at 41 Jixiang Street in the French Concession. His home is at No. 14 Heng'anfang, Zhaozhou Road, Nanyang Bridge in Nanshi. The house is a two-story stone gate building, and Gan himself is the second landlord. The west wing room upstairs is rented to Li Zhijing, a local who works at the Zhongnan Bank. Gan is thrifty by nature and has some savings. In addition, the furnishings in the house are quite luxurious, which has attracted the attention of bandits. Yesterday morning at about 9:00 AM, Gan and his wife were sleeping in the back wing room downstairs when the coachman Ma Asan was tidying up in the hall. Suddenly, four bandits wearing blue cloth clothes and pants and speaking a mixture of local and northern accents rushed in through the back door. They held pistols and drove Asan and the maid into Gan's bedroom together, then searched separately and forced Gan to hand over the key to the iron box. After a long time, they fled after looting. Upon detailed inspection after the incident, it was discovered that Gan's house had been robbed of a gold lock, a gold bracelet, two diamond rings, a gold watch, a racing watch, an emerald, a fox fur coat, and 120 yuan in cash. Li Zhijing's house upstairs was robbed of a gold bracelet, a gold ring, a treasure ring, a platinum watch, a gold pocket watch, more than 100 yuan in cash, and miscellaneous silverware. The total loss of the two families was about 1,000 yuan. The victims then submitted a detailed list of losses and reported it to the Second District General Bureau, requesting a manhunt.</p>
<h3>Bandits Arrested in Commercial Hotel</h3>
<p>Lu Gencai, Zhao Fuhai, Ding Huaguo, and other Chinese detectives from the New Zhabei Police Station, learned that bandits were hiding in the Commercial Hotel on Avenue Haig and were planning illegal activities. They reported this to the captain and, together with Western detective Pei Naiduo, secretly went to the Commercial Hotel at 2:00 AM the day before yesterday. They arrested four bandits in Room 173: Wang Ajin (also known as Wang Qingyuan), Yu Xiaofu (also known as Zhang Awu), Yuan Zhenrong (also known as Xiaoerduo), and Guan De'an (also known as Guan Sanhai). They found a fake pistol and a flashlight in the bed. They also arrested an accomplice, Mei Shengbao (also known as Xia Baosheng), in Room 145 and brought him to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xue Lanru conducted the preliminary hearing. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, saying that the case had just been arrested yesterday morning, and the investigation procedures had not yet been completed, so he requested a postponement. After Judge Xue briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded to custody separately and rescheduled the investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chen Lindi's Pregnancy Issue</h3>
<p>Said to Belong to Wang Shaoquan</p>
<p>Jin Yaoshi, a woman from Yancheng residing at 12 Haiyuan Road in Zhabei, reported that her 14-year-old daughter Gendi, who worked in a silk factory, suddenly disappeared at 7:00 AM on August 22nd. She reported to the police and asked for an arrest. Later, Chinese detectives Jin Guanya and others from the Hongkou Police Station arrested the abductor Wang Yufu (also known as Shouquan) and his concubine Chen Kongshi in the house at 6 Mahuo Road. They found the girl Jin Gendi and the 16-year-old girl Chen Lindi and the 14-year-old girl Xu Guiying and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention pending investigation. Yesterday, Judge Liu Yugui continued the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, said that the case had been rescheduled. Chen Lindi suddenly claimed that her pregnancy was actually related to Wang Yufu's 16-year-old son Wang Shaoquan. She had been instructed by her mother Chen Kongshi in the previous court to falsely accuse her lover Wang Yufu of rape and pregnancy. However, Wang had confessed at the police station that the girl Xu Guiying was bought by Yang Benye, Kongshi's lover, and planned to be a prostitute. Jin Gendi was abducted by Chen Kongshi in collusion with Zhu Saozi, a woman at large, and planned to be taken to Xiamen to be sold. However, it could not be determined whether the pregnancy of the girl Lindi was related to Wang Yufu or Wang Shaoquan. When questioned, Wang Yufu confessed, "My son Shaoquan is indeed studying radio in Xiamen. The girl Lindi did have a relationship with Shaoquan. Now I am being instructed by my concubine Chen Kongshi to falsely accuse me of raping Lindi. I have been in Xiamen. Recently, I received a letter from Kongshi, claiming that Lindi was about to have a child, so I brought 65 dollars to Shanghai, which led to my arrest." When Chen Kongshi was questioned, she stubbornly denied everything. According to the girl Chen Lindi, what was said in the previous court was actually instructed by her mother. My father's son, named Shaoquan, is the same age as me. Last year, my parents went to Xiamen for something. Shaoquan and I slept together several times, that is the truth. After Judge Liu verified the confessions, he remanded the defendants to custody and scheduled a sentence. Xu Guiying and Chen Lindi were sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association for custody pending collection. Jin Gendi was handed over to her mother Yao to be taken away.</p>

<h3>Kill</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>The atmosphere of assassination is not a new invention of the 20th century. Before the birth of Jesus, we Chinese were already playing the trick of [hiding a sword in a fish]. Just like girls not wearing trousers, it was popular in primitive times, but it has only been carried forward and greatly developed at this time.</p>
<p>Heaven has the virtue of cherishing life, so it created people and conveniently created a five-viscera temple so that people who love life and hate death can eat, digest, and go to the pit, or, to put it more gentlemanly, go to the toilet, to continue life, enjoy the prosperity of the world, and taste the pain of the world. It is said that people have the obligation to [live to a ripe old age and die in their sleep], so assassinating people who have not [exhausted their destiny and run out of luck] is not allowed by law, and [arresting the murderer and bringing them to justice] is a must. Suicide is also against the law. It is said that Wei Yancan was sentenced to a crime the year before last.</p>
<p>[A life for a life], one life for one life, can save two people in the world from eating and drinking at the same time, which is more rationalized than anything else. However, the executioner is also doing the job of white knife in and red knife out, but I have never seen the executioner pay for their life. Therefore, I know that the law is beyond the principles of nature, and God is not as intelligent as the people he created, because although he has the virtue of cherishing life and gives everyone the obligation and right to [die in their sleep], people can create executioners who do not pay for their lives.</p>
<p>Assassination is indeed not allowed, and suicide is also not allowed. Therefore, if there is to be [life in and out], in addition to waiting for [dying in one's sleep], one can only seek guidance from the executioner. However, I think that in addition to the executioner, there is someone who is superior to the executioner, called [the armed class]. [The armed class] can fight for justice and [kill the enemy] for justice. Justice is naturally never contrary to the principles of nature, so the executioner can only use the law as a talisman and kill a few prisoners. Only soldiers can [obey the will of heaven] and kill hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of fresh, lively, and daring [enemies]. This is in line with the principles of nature, and it is also the most valuable [kill].</p>
<p>But in this day and age, as soon as there is foreign aggression, the soldiers cannot bear to kill and retreat. When a prisoner is sentenced to death, they appeal until the sentence is changed to life imprisonment, so the executioner has no one to kill. Only suicide is the most popular, and assassination is also developing daily. I really can't see through what kind of world this is.</p>
<h3>Experience of Hunger</h3>
<p>— Jinzi</p>
<p>In China, from toddlers of one or two years old to old men and women with a mouthful of dentures, it can be said that no one is not piously and respectfully practicing the doctrine of eating their fill, not hesitating to cause stomach ailments or diarrhea to eat and drink as much as possible, until they are so full that they cannot stand up. Therefore, a foreigner once said that the excrement excreted by ten Chinese people every day is more than enough for fifteen foreigners in two days, which is really not a lie. Therefore, I often think that if someone comes up with a topic and asks everyone to write an article describing hunger, the result will definitely be ninety-nine blank papers. The one non-blank paper will inevitably be written by those modern girls who are gradually becoming fat. This fantasy prompted my own experiment. From a certain day in the morning, I made a great determination and began to fast in order to write an article about it.</p>
<p>Before twelve o'clock on that day, there was no change. Although my stomach was slightly rumbling, I tried not to let my brain think about the two words "eat". After sitting there for an hour, my spirit gradually became tired, and I yawned involuntarily once or twice. The saliva in my mouth seemed to be much more than usual, and it was very sweet and greasy. I spat out a mouthful, and in less than five minutes it was full again. The situation was exactly the same as before getting cholera and vomiting in the summer, but I tried my best to endure it, and勉强 sat for another half an hour before slowly walking out of the garden. However, my legs at this time were somewhat different from my legs when I entered the garden. Every two steps I took, I only went as far as one normal step, and the speed of movement gradually decreased. As I walked past a small restaurant, the several pots of yellow soybean sprouts and pork knuckle meat on the counter shone with a dazzling light like diamonds, dazzling in front of my eyes. The sound of bowls colliding with each other drowned out the sound of the streetcar bell and the horn of the car and pierced straight into my eardrums, causing me to turn my head several times. It was not easy to squeeze into the writing room, and a glass of plain water was swallowed like nectar. However, the constant yawning and a mouthful of saliva that filled half a cup of plain water had exhausted me so that I could no longer work. I sat there in a state of being neither asleep nor awake, neither sick nor healthy, until five o'clock. As soon as I left the office door, my first desire was to find a restaurant. However, the first thing I encountered was a pancake shop. At that time, the pancakes seemed as lovely as gold and as fragrant as orchids to me. As a result, I ended my ten-hour fast on the sidewalk.</p>
<h3>Chengdu Visitor's Talk</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhichun</p>
<p>The Chinese New Pharmaceutical Association, this time sent a standing committee member, Mr. Ye Shanding, to various ports along the Yangtze River, to discuss association affairs. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his work. I heard from him about the Chengdu news, which was very interesting. As far as I can remember, I will write it down.</p>
<p>▲More Opium Dens than Restaurants: Opium is prevalent in Chengdu, and the price is very cheap. One large copper coin (worth two hundred cash) can be used to smoke a full portion. Nineteen out of ten citizens are addicted to it, so opium dens are everywhere, and there are not many restaurants. Often, people are hungry and have nowhere to satisfy their hunger, but opium addicts can always blow smoke rings.</p>
<p>▲Sichuanese People Don't Like to Eat Pickled Mustard Tuber: The Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, which is sold well in Shanghai, is not liked by the Sichuanese people. There are rarely any dishes that use pickled mustard tuber.</p>
<p>▲No Eminent Monks on Mount Emei: Unofficial histories and novels often say that there are many eminent monks on Mount Emei. Although we do not believe that they have Buddhist powers, we always thought that there must be many old and kind people. In fact, it is completely the opposite. The so-called eminent monks on Mount Emei are all thin and weak opium addicts.</p>
<p>▲Barbering and Bananas: The cost of living in that place is extremely low.</p>
<h3>Famous Sayings</h3>
<p>The World Economic Conference, which is of historical significance, gathers the talents of various countries in one hall, and each shows his eloquence with words and swords. There are many words of warning among them. After reading the newspaper, I compiled them into famous sayings.</p>
<p>I would like to extend a special welcome to the representatives of the British dominions and India. (The King of England)</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people in the world has reached as many as 30 million. (British Prime Minister MacDonald)</p>
<p>To make other countries poor is to make yourself poor. (Ibid.)</p>
<p>It is advisable to promote large-scale public works to absorb unemployment. (French Prime Minister Daladier)</p>
<p>It is advisable to establish a 40-hour work week and devote ourselves to the organization of labor. (Ibid.)</p>
<p>If political disputes are not resolved, the world crisis will not go away. (German Foreign Minister Neurath)</p>
<p>If gold cannot circulate freely, gold coins will be meaningless. (Ibid.)</p>
<p>International conferences held recently often have considerable sincerity at the beginning, but at the end, they not only have the opposite effect but also cause unfortunate results. (Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov)</p>
<p>The disease of the world today is not due to overproduction, but due to the reduction of purchasing power. (German representative Hugenberg) China has only 7,000 miles of railways, while the United States has 275,000 miles. China has 20,000 miles of motor vehicle roads, while the United States has 3 million miles. (Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen) (Jingzi)</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Heartache and Well Wishes Amidst Hectic Military Life, Covert Troop Movements</p>
<p>They had set off to the front lines before, but there was always some advance notice. Besides, drawing up the manifests always took three to five days. Why was this time so rushed? It was strange. However, the regimental commander had called a meeting. This was a superior officer a rank above, so of course, he couldn't disobey. He could only hurry there to avoid being late. Thinking this, he didn't hesitate for even five minutes and arrived at the regimental headquarters. A large dining table stood in the center. The regimental commander sat at the head, with the three battalion commanders, one on the left and two on the right, flanking him. The company commanders, feeling somewhat timid, sat at the far end of the large dining table. The regimental commander first scanned everyone with his gaze, then stood up with a stern expression and said, "At six o'clock this morning, I received an order from the brigade commander that our troops are to set off immediately. I am now giving each battalion forty-eight hours to prepare all the departure procedures." As he said this, his face was very serious. After finishing, he seemed to have a slight smile on his face, and he raised his voice a little, saying, "Regarding the issue of supplies, of course, we cannot provide them according to the usual standards. Our division and brigade commanders have already gone to petition on our behalf. In the future, each company can report eighteen civilian laborers and sixteen horses per month, and supplies will be provided accordingly." The nine company commanders sat there, and hearing the words "supplies will be provided accordingly," each seemed to find a kind of comfort in their hearts, and they looked at each other. The regimental commander said, "Departure expenses have also been roughly determined. Each company can temporarily borrow twenty yuan from the regimental headquarters." This sentence stunned all the company commanders present. They didn't dare look at the regimental commander, but only at the battalion commanders. They all thought, "This departure is certainly carrying a very important responsibility. Now, they say that each company will only be given twenty yuan for the front. Twenty yuan for over a hundred people. How much does that break down to per person? Even if the brothers aren't given a single cent and it's all used for miscellaneous expenses, if the three platoon leaders each ask to borrow five yuan, it seems impossible not to give it to them at a time like this. In addition, the sergeant and quartermaster... who can say they won't borrow one or two yuan? A company commander can only stare blankly. Where will the money come from? Soldiers who have been stationed for a long time all hope to set off and find a few 'departure fee' coins, but like this, they'd rather nothing happen." (209)</p>
<p>Even in terms of banquets, those costing eleven or twelve yuan in Shanghai only sell for three or four yuan in Chengdu. However, haircuts and incense are especially expensive. A haircut at an average barber shop costs seventy-five cents, and each banana sells for about ten to twelve cents in silver dollars.</p>
<p>▲ Citizens Refuse to Use Inflated Currency</p>
<p>Shanghai currency is not circulating in the Sichuan market, and must first be exchanged for Sichuan currency at exchange offices, where every hundred yuan can be inflated by more than ten yuan, but must be exchanged in whole hundreds. Logically, this Shanghai currency, since it can be inflated, should be welcomed by citizens, but unexpectedly it is rejected. The reason for this is really difficult to fathom.</p>
<p>▲ Qianlong as an Arhat</p>
<p>Mount Emei has five hundred Arhat statues, each with different appearances and expressions. One of them is an image of the Qing Emperor Qianlong. It is said by the monks that when he went south, he compared himself to an Arhat and jokingly had this statue made.</p>
<p>▲ Strange Sight of Monkeys</p>
<p>Monkeys are abundant in all mountains, especially Mount Emei. I bought a handful of beans from a temple monk and scattered them in front of the temple. The monk shouted, "Children!" and immediately a large monkey rushed out, briefly inspected the guests, then let out a long howl. Upon hearing the sound, the monkeys all emerged, their numbers difficult to estimate, leaping and climbing branches, a truly interesting sight.</p>
<p>▲ High Price of Silver Ear Fungus</p>
<p>Sichuan is the producing area of ​​silver ear fungus, but the price is actually higher than in other provinces. Inferior quality sells for three or four yuan per tael, while good quality requires ten yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the Vase and the Vase Stand</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>After reading Ms. Hua's "Vase or Vase Stand?" in the local supplement the other day, I felt a bit uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In recent years, "vase" has become a general term for women with jobs. I don't have the time to do a study on when and who started this peculiar term, but it's probably a new term that has emerged in the last few years, right? What exactly does the term "vase" mean? It really makes people think. If it is said that women in companies or organizations are like beautiful decorations, hence the term "vase," then I think the vase is for holding flowers. Without flowers, the vase cannot be displayed. There is a vase, but where are the flowers!?</p>
<p>Now, here comes Ms. Hua promoting the beautiful term "vase stand." Ms. Hua can't stand the term "vase" and uses "stand" as a term of resistance. I think this is very inappropriate. A vase is placed on a stand. This is tantamount to saying that women are being elevated by men. To put it bluntly, it means that women must rely on men to increase everything about them. In other words, everything about a woman is cultivated by men; further, women must rely on men and cannot display their own talents. Why? Think about it. Without a vase stand, the vase would not look beautiful. With a vase stand, the beauty of the vase can be displayed!</p>
<p>That's why I say the term "vase stand" is inappropriate. It's not a retaliation against "vase," it's simply a further admission of the term "vase"!</p>
<p>However, I'm not saying that the term "vase stand" is inappropriate, but that women should think of another name to ridicule men. The term "vase" contains a lot of insulting elements. The person who came up with this term only feels embarrassed, inferior, and cheapens themselves. It has nothing to do with others. True gold is not afraid of fire. Those idle words are of no hindrance. Being human is about being yourself!</p>
<p>People with self-respect will never apply these terms to others. In any case, society needs mutual assistance. It can never be established unilaterally by men or women. Why bother retaliating like this, a vase for a stand, retaliating against those despicable fellows for nothing?</p>

<p>(There is also the North China Medical Journal of Beiping. It has now been discontinued. Publications such as Ciyou Drug Rehabilitation are related to medicine and pharmacy. They are not included here.) Looking at the above table, several points can be known. (1) The total number of various publications in various ports across the country. Only like Shanghai, new medicine is not published inland. It is conceivable. (2) Among the 22 publications in various places, apart from 8 specialized publications and 2 popular ones for the public, there are 12 more ordinary types with the same format. (3) There are several publications in one place, namely Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. In addition, there are only 9 publications in 6 provinces. (4) Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Gansu, Anhui, Shanxi, Sichuan, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet, these 13 provinces probably have no medical publications at all.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above two tables and the points raised, there are several conclusions that can be drawn. (1) There are so many medical and pharmaceutical publications in Shanghai. It's terrifying. I'm afraid no other major port in the world has this kind of excitement. (2) New medicine is not published in areas where it doesn't exist. More developed areas have many publications in one place, each doing its own thing. In China, where transportation is inconvenient, it is certainly necessary to have publications in various places. However, there are as many as 30 on the Ningbo-Shanghai-Hangzhou line alone, which is a bit excessive. If someone says that the Chinese do not cooperate, there is really no way to answer. (3) The periodicity of various publications, due to material reasons, is divided into ten-day publications, semi-monthly publications, monthly publications, quarterly publications, etc. The quality varies, and the economic bias is uneven. Although freedom of publication is said, it is ultimately easy to fail. It is definitely not a long-term solution. (4) Most of the 40-odd publications just use the words "new," "medicine," "pharmacy," "health," "public," "people," and "science" in different orders to determine the name, which makes readers feel that the names are confusing and headache-inducing.</p>
<p>All of this is just a problem in the medical and pharmaceutical publishing industry, where they focus too much on the subjective aspect ("venting for the sake of venting") and do not pay attention to the objective aspect ("interest in acceptance").</p>
<h3>(C) Periodic Publications Self-Published by Pharmaceutical Merchants (All Published in Shanghai)</h3>
<p>(1) Medicine and Pharmacy Quarterly German Merchant MediGen Foreign Firm</p>

<p>(8) New Medical and Pharmaceutical View Japanese Merchant Takeda Chobei</p>
<p>(9) Sanchang Medical Journal Japanese Merchant Sanchang Foreign Firm (The above three have reduced their activities due to resistance to goods)</p>
<p>According to this type of pharmaceutical merchant publication, it has been very popular in various countries in recent years. Its content is nothing more than a compilation of the originally necessary reports on the pharmacological and physiological effects of the factory's products. In addition, there are the experiences of major hospitals and famous doctors in using the drug, and excerpts from various medical journals of new therapies for certain diseases by various hospitals and famous doctors related to the factory's products. It is edited into a book and published periodically. The editorial staff hired is also very knowledgeable in the medical field. Now, the publications published by various foreign firms in Shanghai are nothing more than excerpts and translations of this type of "new treatment report." Its content inevitably has the meaning of focusing on publicity. The biggest drawback is that the materials in the translation cannot prove the position of the drug in Chinese medical treatment. How is it exactly? Therefore, it is certainly not impossible for those with roots in the medical field to use it as a reference. However, some doctors simply take it as a textbook and rashly use its products. That is simply medical skills of "only reading therapeutics and copying them," which is a bit inappropriate.</p>
<p>(Corrigendum) In the text of the previous issue, "Xinwen Bao New Medical and Pharmaceutical Journal" was incorrectly printed as "Public Medicine." Please correct it immediately.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Jiao Yitang's Letter to the Nation on the Adoption of National Medicine Regulations (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>The example cited by Mr. Pi is mildly relieved, but the tuberculosis bacteria and white blood cells in the urine can still prove that it has not reached the realm of cure. However, I have an example that is more obvious. Nine years ago, I had a colleague who suffered from cryptic hematuria. Animal experiments were performed on his urethral membrane, and the results proved that it was unilateral kidney tuberculosis. However, this colleague is still healthy and alive today, performing his duties without any obstacles. His urine is also clear, and the bacteria have disappeared. This is an example of a cure without surgery. Even so, ... I have observed that in most cases, those who refuse surgery or cannot undergo it due to other reasons usually have bad outcomes. The aforementioned colleague of mine was a natural cure. Now, let's put aside the imagined empty theories and examine the facts. Let's take my colleague's example of natural cure and Mr. Pi's slightly questionable example as one aspect of the facts. In contrast to these facts, we have the brilliant achievements of many surgeries. I have performed 67 kidney removals for tuberculosis, and 6 people died during surgery, which is a mortality rate of 8.9%. That is, more than 91% are reliable. As for the rest, 3 people died due to the progression of tuberculosis in other organs. The rest who underwent surgery recovered their health and were able to eliminate their severe and unbearable pain, gaining weight from 10 to 40 pounds. Statistically speaking, the good results of surgery are increasing year by year. Among the 43 recent kidney removal surgeries, only 2 died, accounting for only 4.6%.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao! Compatriots! Please think carefully about this passage! Although Dr. Caussé had an example of his own colleague, he believed it was a natural cure. Based on his experiments, most cases without surgery had bad results; on the other hand, the results of surgery were 95% reliable; He is completely based on medical statistics and still advocates surgery. The certainty of his argument is probably much more certain than the sporadic and occasional cases cited by Mr. Jiao. However, it is undoubtedly possible to cure kidney tuberculosis with conservative treatment, according to the facts of Mr. He, Mr. Wu Ziqin's grandson, and Dr. Caussé's colleague.</p>
<p>I think Hu Shi is a gentle person, and I suspect that he has latent tuberculosis in his body. I also suspect that what he suffered from before was kidney tuberculosis. Then, his cure, like that of Dr. Caussé's colleague, was also a natural cure. On the surface, it seems that those who advocate palliative treatment have won. From an academic point of view, those who advocate removal are still right. Lu Zhong'an just won the lottery in the natural cure lottery. What is it worth academically? A group of alarmists do not explore from a theoretical perspective. Look at Mr. Hu himself. He is good at writing articles. He is the ancestor of modern vernacular literature. How can he not say a few words of introduction to introduce the benefactor who cured his chronic disease, tell the people of the country, and pass it on to future generations? Why does he only praise verbally and is unwilling to put pen to paper easily? This is Mr. Hu's suffering, Mr. Hu's knowledge, Mr. Hu's learning, Mr. Hu's value. Can Mr. Jiao not feel ashamed of it?</p>
<p>Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, the few examples cited by Mr. Jiao can only be attributed to the scope of the four characters "lucky coincidence." What other words can be used to praise it? To be honest with Mr. Jiao, because I have always studied Chinese medical books, people in society often bring a large stack of prescriptions from your national doctors to me, asking me to diagnose and treat diseases that your national doctors cannot treat, and asking me to criticize them. There are always several cases a day. It is true that there are many cases of misdiagnosis and misprescription that are very laughable. I have also treated many patients that Lu Zhong'an could not treat, and I have also seen many of his prescriptions. However, I have never been willing to criticize the merits and demerits of the living examples of a certain doctor in writing. I believe that judging people by success or failure is certainly not a good way to criticize, and there is also a hint of business exclusion, so I am unwilling to do it. Today, Lu Zhong'an's words were brought up by Mr. Jiao, so I cannot help but express some views.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said, "They refuse to admit that they have shortcomings, so they do not advocate that there is a national doctor in addition to their Western medicine. Not only are they unwilling to accept the strengths of national medicine and participate in promoting it, but they also advocate abolishing it from a position of opposition to national medicine. ... Taking a step back, the civilization of Western medicine is progressing day by day. The various symptoms mentioned above now have solutions. In short, there is no problem academically. We must also ask, there are only over 2,000 registered Western doctors in the country, can they cope with the 400 million population of the country? I must first ask Mr. Jiao, from a theoretical point of view, is there still a possibility for your national medicine to exist? For those who have a little mind and a little conscience academically, everyone admits today that the theory of your national medicine is completely unreliable and must be eliminated. In other words, it can be completely abolished. Therefore, the principle of abolishing old medicine cannot be shaken by anyone. If the people of the country have the perseverance, order, and knowledge of world trends and the evolution of scholarship, they can discuss the method from this principle. The population distribution problem raised by Mr. Jiao should of course also be discussed. In 1929, I proposed a motion to abolish old medicine at the Central Health Committee, and I drafted a proper method: I said that by the end of 1930, all apprentices and grandchildren of old doctors, as long as they are over 20 years old, should be unconditionally registered and given the right to practice for life, but they should not be allowed to reproduce thereafter. People, please think about it, starting from the age of 20, calculating on average, up to the age of 60, there is a full 40-year period, that is, the period until old medicine is completely abolished</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>is a full 40 years later. It will also take 40 years to complete the task of distributing the population with scientific medicine to replace old medicine. During these 40 years, old medicine will of course continue to operate in a crude way and continue to distribute the population. What are we afraid of not being able to distribute? If our precious China is still not making progress after 40 years, if it is still the same as it is now, I am afraid that it has been subjugated for a long time and there is no need for us to distribute it. My proposal, my method, is to take care of all aspects. At that time, old doctors had no awareness of their own theories at all. Not even one person was willing to admit the idea of ​​organizing with scientific methods. When they heard the word abolition, they were immediately furious and unwilling to calmly study my proposal. They thought that it would be abolished immediately, that they would have no food to eat immediately, that the people would have no doctors immediately, and that the pharmacies would have no business immediately. A storm arose, and the government also muddled through and shelved this resolution. This incident was completely used false propaganda to instigate the people of the country and bewitch the government. How could it conform to my proposal? To this day, Mr. Jiao still wants to hold this kind of argument and use this kind of trick. Is it not ridiculous?</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said, "From the perspective of the national economy, only a very small number of the bourgeoisie have believed in Western medicine and taken Western medicine in recent years, but they have already created an annual sales of 100 million yuan for Western medicine, which is about 60 million yuan more than the annual sales of about 40 million yuan for Chinese medicine. If national medicine is abolished and the general public all take Western medicine, then how much more will the annual sales of Western medicine increase? This kind of argument sounds very pleasing on the surface, so in recent years, it has been used as an excuse for national doctors to eke out a living. In fact, it is extremely naive and is an argument from the era of isolation, not a fundamental way to save the country. Please see the silk and tea industries, which have always been our China's exclusive trading products. They have declined so badly in recent years that not only have exports decreased, but large amounts are imported. This is not because there are Western silk scholars and Western tea scholars in the country advocating domestic goods, but because science is not developed. It is the natural principle of survival of the fittest. The result is natural. Chinese medicine and Western medicine are the same. If you go backwards, even if there are Western doctors in the country, they will decline day by day. This is an inevitable law of cause and effect. Now, hurry up and catch up, and there will be a day when you reach your own manufacturing. If you go against the trend of the world and want to resist scientific medicine with national medicine and resist scientific medicine with natural grass roots and bark, stop dreaming! The silk and tea industries are a lesson from the past and should be a wake-up call! Is Mr. Jiao still sleeping here? Look at the military, transportation, education, industry, commerce, etc. Which one does not need foreign goods? Don't you know the word leakage? In the transitional era, you cannot stop, you can only desperately catch up and reach the point of self-manufacturing and use, which is a way out. Isolationism is a policy that harms the country! If you don't recognize the small, you will mess up the big plan! Alas! Mr. Jiao! Since the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, the history of failure of isolationism has been clear. This road to national subjugation cannot be taken again! Please look further afield and plan on a larger scale. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of saving the country through science is absolutely correct. Be bold and go straight according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's guidance, and there will be a day to rise. Don't be indecisive! The tide of evolution cannot be suppressed. There are only the four words "failure and destruction" waiting for you if you drive backwards!</p>
<p>Mr. Jiao said, "On the other hand, the total number of doctors, pharmaceutical workers, and farmers who are directly or indirectly engaged in the pharmaceutical industry in the country is no less than tens of millions. Once these tens of millions of people are unemployed, how will the country provide relief? The value of international trade imports and the unemployed population in the country will increase at the same time, causing a shake-up of the national economy as a whole. Who should be responsible? From the perspective of medical results, from the perspective of doctor distribution, and from the perspective of the national economy, abolishing national medicine is obviously impossible." Mr. Jiao's argument and thinking are really incomprehensible. According to my plan, it is not within a day or two that old medicine will be wiped out, and there is still a period of at least 40 years. Mr. Jiao insists on saying that tens of millions of people will become unemployed at once. The words "at once" are fabricated. Doctors who use Western medicine cannot be transformed like the Monkey King plucking a handful of hair in an instant. It will take at least 40 years. Mr. Jiao insists on saying that they will increase at the same time, causing a shake-up of the national economy as a whole. The four words "increase at the same time" are over-interpreted. This kind of speech is not only wrong, not only alarmist, but seems close to slander and misrepresentation. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Use of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Western Medicine (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>▲(14) Clove Caryopbyllus</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>This product is the dried flower bud of the clove plant (Eugenia Caryophyllata Willd) belonging to the Myrtle family (Myrtaceae). It is picked or collected after falling, then smoked and sun-dried until it turns brown, and used in medicine.</p>
<p>Characteristics</p>
<p>The product is currently dark brown, or brownish-black, with the ovary being a blunt tetragonal long cylindrical shape. The upper part is divided into two chambers, containing seeds, about twenty in total. Above the ovary is a four-lobed calyx, and inside the calyx are four petals. Inside the petals are numerous curved stamens and a pistil stigma. It has a pleasant and strong odor, a fragrant and pungent taste, followed by a slight numbing sensation.</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>This product contains volatile oil, namely clove oil, as much as about 15 to 20%. The oil is heavier than water, sinking when placed in water. The reason it is heavier than water is that the oil is composed of eugenol. The aroma also comes from eugenol. Other components include gums, resins, tannic acid, oxalic acid, etc.</p>
<h3>Test</h3>
<p>The fully mature product has a weak aroma. Unopened flower buds should be collected. A good quality product has a strong aroma and abundant essential oil. When pressed on paper, it should leave an oily stain. When placed in water, the product should float vertically on the surface of the water, or sink to the bottom. Products from which the oil has been extracted, or old products, will float horizontally on the surface of the water because the oil has disappeared.</p>
<h3>Efficacy and Storage Method</h3>
<p>This product is a stomachic and carminative. It is often made into powders or solutions and used in combination with other medicines. Because it contains volatile components, it should be stored in tightly sealed glass containers. Metallic containers may be corroded due to acid.</p>
<p>(Appendix Old Sayings) Pungent and warm, purely Yang, releases the lungs, warms the stomach, greatly cures the kidneys, strengthens Yang, warms the Yin, treats stomach cold, congestion, belching, hiccupping, rushing piglet (abdominal spasm), hypochondriac mass, abdominal pain, bad breath, smallpox, stomach deficiency. Contraindicated in heat conditions. For crab poisoning, decoct cloves and take orally. For toothache caused by caries, mix clove oil with cotton and place in the cavity. Avoid fire. Avoid turmeric.</p>
<h3>Letter Discussing Tuberculosis Transmission with a Friend</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>丨Popular Discourse丨</p>
<p>To Mr. So-and-so,</p>
<p>I am delighted to listen to your great discussions on the radio every day, as if I were hearing your coughs in the same room. Mr. So-and-so, with your spirit of serving society, you are giving lectures on medical common sense, which is enabling the public to grow in new knowledge, and allowing colleagues to warm up their old learning. The benefits are immeasurable. In recent days, you have been discussing the problem of tuberculosis, proving that this disease is not mainly caused by cow's milk in China. This shows your brilliant insights, and your suggestion that the cause lies in the bad habit of spitting everywhere is deeply admirable. However, from my personal observation, while spitting is sufficient to spread germs, it is not as harmful as the practice of eating together. Sputum spat on the ground spreads germs into the air, which rise with the sun and are scattered by the wind. Even if one or two germs enter the human body through the respiratory tract, the number is very small, and the harm is not too severe. However, when eating together, cups and plates are mixed, and dishes are presented in disarray. A single spoonful is where everyone's saliva gathers, and a single dish is what everyone's chopsticks seek. It is impossible to know in advance whether the guests have tuberculosis, and even if you know, there is no way to avoid it. Thus, within a single drink and a single bite, a large number of germs are transmitted by the passing of chopsticks and spoons, and gradually enter the lungs. Therefore, the root cause of tuberculosis transmission is the practice of eating together, which is even worse than transmission through respiration. Observations over the past century provide many examples. A friend of mine once suffered from this disease, and his children, up to the age of four or five, all developed enlarged cervical lymph nodes, showing symptoms of lymphatic tuberculosis. Although the harm was not deep, their bodies were all weak. Later, I asked him for advice and suggested that he eat separately. Since then, the children born have shown none of the above symptoms. Mr. Calmette, a French tuberculosis expert, conducted on-site research on the causes of tuberculosis transmission. He raised groups of chickens in two places, one with tuberculosis germs spread in the chicken coop space, and the other with tuberculosis germs mixed in the chicken feeding utensils. The results of his experiment showed that eight or nine out of ten were infected by eating, while very few were infected by air. This is sufficient to prove my humble opinion. In summary, unless the practice of eating together is eliminated, there will be no hope of permanently preventing the transmission of tuberculosis germs. Mr. So-and-so, with your benevolent heart, you seek the happiness of the public. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinion to supplement your esteemed words, which may be of small help in preventing tuberculosis transmission. Words cannot fully express my meaning. I humbly ask for your review and approval. I wish you good health. Your younger brother, Song Guobin, bows his head.</p>
<p>[P Pharmaceutical Education and Pharmacist Qualification in Europe (3)</p>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>5.  Norwegian Pharmacy Schools. Only the University of Oslo has a pharmacy department. The training for pharmacist qualifications involves students who have practiced in a pharmacy for three years entering the University of Oslo to receive short-term pharmaceutical education for three or four months, then studying under a formal pharmacist for one year of experience, followed by two years of university coursework (some students with superior academic abilities can complete it in one and a half years). In other words, the training for a pharmacist in Norway requires a total of six years: two years of university courses and four years of practical experience. Many pharmacists continue to work as pharmacy assistants for a long time. Recently, the university's pharmaceutical education has adopted a new system. The curriculum is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Three semesters of natural sciences: chemistry, physics, botany, and short-term practical pharmacy coursework. (2) Three semesters of pharmacy service.</p>
<p>(3) Upon completion, students study pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmaceutical industrial chemistry, pharmacognosy, bacteriology, food and drug chemistry, and hygiene and commerce.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Pharmacopoeia is, of course, determined by the state and has a permanent committee called Den FarmacopoKimmsson, organized in 1898. It consists of three university medical professors and six pharmaceutical professors. The chairman is the university president, Dr. Paulson. The pharmacopoeia published in 1913 is currently being revised, and the organization of the committee has also been expanded.</p>
<p>6.  The institutions for pharmaceutical education in Italy include the pharmacy departments of the universities of Rome, Turin, Pavia, Bologna, etc. The academic system is a four-year regular course and a three-year internship. There is also a five-year research course specifically for studying pharmaceutical chemistry and other science doctorates.</p>
<p>7.  Pharmacists in Belgium also have certain qualifications. The pharmacopoeia is regulated by the state. Pharmacists must complete a four-year Belgian university course and a one-year pharmacy internship. Their degree is a pharmaceutical chemist.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical education in Europe, whether in England, France, or Germany, has complete courses that can represent all countries in Europe. The completion of pharmacist qualifications provides ample practical experience in pharmacies to achieve the ultimate goal of pharmacist practice. Theory does not become empty practice, and experience has a basis. Our country in this era of construction needs talent everywhere, which relies entirely on education. Looking at the whole country, there are only three or two formal pharmaceutical schools. Therefore, it is impossible to start organizing the pharmaceutical industry. It is hoped that the education authorities and health agencies will work together to address this issue, as it is a matter of utmost urgency. (End)</p>

Mr. Pan will return to Shanghai after attending the opening ceremony of the National Games.</p>
<h3>Arriving Merrily in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) Shanghai's athletes all departed for Nanjing at 8 AM yesterday. The men's basketball team and men's tennis team are staying at the Central Hotel, while the soccer team is lodging at the Anle Restaurant. The track and field, volleyball, swimming, and all-around athletes are all housed at Central University. Over a hundred athletes, bustling and energetic, are now described in their various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Wolfing Down Food: As soon as the train started, the soccer team took the lead, followed by the basketball and tennis teams, all heading toward the dining room. The waiters couldn't manage the rush, so Zheng Zhaojia and others personally stepped in. For a while, they were wolfing down food, with plates and cups in a mess – quite a sight. The female athletes, however, were more polite and didn't compete with the men for a momentary advantage.</p>
<p>Singing at the Top of Their Lungs: After the meal, the athletes felt a bit bored. The famous soccer player Jiang Shanqing, unable to resist the pressure from those around him, had no choice but to sing at the top of his lungs. His voice was smooth and melodious, truly extraordinary. Li Ning joined in, also earning considerable applause.</p>
<p>Clumsy Imitation: The short-distance runner Cheng Jinguan brought several fans with him, asking the athletes to sign them as souvenirs. The male athletes readily obliged, but a female comrade named Wu Ben insisted that Cheng sing a song as a condition. Surrounded by women, Cheng had no power to resist, so he sang "Misty Rain" once, and the surrounding laughter resounded to the skies.</p>
<p>Discussing the Overall Situation: The basketball team captain, Lu Zhongen, discussed the overall situation. Lu believes that the Tianjin, Beijing, and Nanjing teams are strong rivals. While the Philippine team's technique is commendable, their talent is unevenly distributed. If Beijing gets former military academy players, their strength will be very formidable. Predicting who will win the championship is extremely difficult, he said.</p>
<p>Arrival Scene: The train arrived at Xiaguan at 2:30 PM. The organizing committee's reception was already waiting at the station. The Shanghai Education Bureau had sent Wang Keyong to arrange accommodation. Besides Central University, the Jiangsu athletes are staying at the gymnasium. After the male and female athletes got off the train, they boarded four large prepared vehicles, each flying the flag of the Shanghai delegation, speeding straight towards Zhongshan Road. People along the way stopped to watch and welcomed them with applause.</p>
<p>Colorful Attire: The male and female athletes' clothing was very beautiful. Among the female athletes, the volleyball players were especially fashionable, followed by the basketball team. The tennis player Su Zuqi was the most unassuming, while the track and field athlete Qian Shengfeng was the most lively. Meng Jian wore an all-red outfit, attracting the attention of the Beijing citizens and athletes from other regions.</p>
<p>Hopes for Championships: This time, the strength of Shanghai's representatives in various events is very balanced. They can potentially sweep the four championships in men's and women's track and field and all-around events. The swimming talent is also enough to compete with Hong Kong and Guangdong. All ball sports can reach the semi-finals and finals. Shanghai is very confident in winning the men's overall championship, so the entire team's arrival in Nanjing has attracted great attention from all quarters and mobilized the entire city.</p>
<p>Competition Committee's Second Meeting</p>
<p>Resolutions:</p>
<p>Women's basketball will not extend, the winner is determined by the number of fouls</p>
<p>Men's tennis best of five, women's tennis best of three</p>
<p>Each athlete can participate in a maximum of four events, not including relays</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) Various competition issues urgently needed resolution, so the organizing committee advanced the second meeting of the competition committee to the evening of the 8th at the Central Hotel. Attendees included Zhang Boling, Chu Minyi, Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Lidun, Wu Yunrui, Zhang Xinfu, Wu Bangwei, Xu Yusheng, and Ma John, with Peng Baichuan attending as an observer. Zhang Boling presided. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 AM. It was learned that the key points discussed and resolved were as follows: (1) The previous meeting was considered a discussion due to the small number of attendees. The resolutions from the last meeting were either canceled or ratified. (2) The winner of women's basketball will not be determined by overtime; if there is a tie, the team with fewer personal fouls wins. If the personal fouls are the same, the team with fewer technical fouls wins. If the technical fouls are the same, a rematch will be scheduled. (3) Men's tennis will adopt a best-of-five format, and women's tennis will adopt a best-of-three format. (4) If a referee cannot attend due to circumstances, the replacement should be nominated by the organizing committee. (5) As there is only one registrant for women's Chinese martial arts wrestling, it will be changed to a martial arts performance. (6) All sports equipment for the Games will be reviewed by the review committee for approval. (7) Athletes residing outside the venue should be provided with timely transportation, and the volleyball court at the north end of the track and field should be converted into a rest area for athletes. (8) Other administrative issues will be handled by the organizing committee through its various divisions. (9) A meeting of the organizing committee will be held on the morning of the 9th. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, a joint meeting of all team leaders, referees, organizing committee members, and heads of various divisions will be convened to report on competition-related matters.

<h3>Old and Young Athletes at the Games</h3>
<p>丨Hebei's Chen Changyou is over 40 years old 丨</p>
<p>丨Shanxi team members are even over 50 years old 丨</p>
<p>丨Henan athletes are all 16 or 17 years old 丨</p>
<p>Dong Shouyi Speaks</p>
<p>The Elderly Should Still Exercise, Athletes Should Obey Referees</p>
<p>Zhang Lingjia's Decathlon Should Secure First Place</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th dispatch) Games referee Dong Shouyi said that the Hebei team participated in all championship events. The athletes from Hebei were interested in any competition, and have good results. However, when competing with the best in the country, they can only score points and have no hope of winning championships. The only exception is Zhang Lingjia's decathlon, where he should secure first place. It is a pity that the decathlon general Yan Huatang was injured and cannot attend. Otherwise, the Hebei team would have won the all-around championship. Other track and field and ball games have no special achievements. The most important thing to note at this National Games are two points. He hopes that colleagues in the sports world and various newspapers will unanimously advocate and encourage veteran athletes who are over forty or fifty years old and still enthusiastically participate in the National Games. To his knowledge, Chen Changyou, a member of the Hebei tennis team and current principal of Luhe Middle School in Hebei, is over forty years old. In 1915, he was a representative at the Far Eastern Games. For decades, he has worked tirelessly in sports and set an example. This spirit is a model for all athletes and is admirable. In addition, there is another Shanxi team member who is over fifty years old and is also a veteran athlete, but his name has been forgotten. Second, the ethics of athletes should be highly valued and cherished by all parties. China's problems in getting any cause on track are that people generally lack this moral spirit. He hopes that everyone will obey the referees to show the spirit of national cooperation.</p>
<p>The Henan men and women athletes total 230, including 50 women and 30 staff members. The general leader, Shen Dali, arrived in Pukou on the evening of the 7th, crossed the river, and entered the city. The athletes are all around sixteen or seventeen years old and are very lively. Among them are 66 national martial arts athletes, 62 men and 4 women. According to Shen, the team arrived in Bian on the afternoon of the 6th and traveled from Xuzhou to the Jinpu Railway on the morning of the 7th to Nanjing. They are participating in all events, but the results remain to be seen. Also, according to Chen Panlang, the manager of national martial arts, the Henan national martial arts athletes are very talented and are confident in archery, kicking, and pellet shooting. It is unknown who will win the national martial arts championship in the future.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Talks About the Importance of the National Games</h3>
<p>Participation of All Provinces Represents National Unity</p>
<p>Hopes That Trivial Matters Will Not Be Criticized and Disputes Reduced</p>
<p>Merely Creating New Records Is Not Worth It</p>
<p>The chief referee of the Games, Zhang Boling, and committee members Hao Gengsheng and Yuan Guoli, among others, returned to Nanjing with the Hebei athletes. When asked by reporters about sports refereeing matters, disputes often arise over minor details. How will this be eliminated? What are the hopes for this National Games? Zhang replied that all provinces have representatives participating in this National Games, which represents national unity. Even the lost northeastern provinces have participating representatives, so the significance of this conference is very important. He hopes that all team leaders and athletes will deeply understand this significance and not be critical of trivial matters. He believes that disputes can be eliminated invisibly. He also said that the common diseases of the Chinese people are weakness and selfishness. Since the significance of this conference is very important, he hopes to eradicate bad habits and turn weakness into strength and selfishness into public spirit. Otherwise, spending so much money on the conference to create new records is not worth it.</p>
<h3>Number of Championship Events Participated in by Each Unit</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai and Hebei Participate in All</p>
<p>The number of men's and women's championship events participated in by each unit is: Shanghai 17, Hebei 16, Beijing 16, Guangdong 15, Hunan 15, Jiangsu 14, Sichuan 13, Henan 14, Fujian 12, Hubei 11, Hebei 17, Jiangxi 11, Anhui 10, Zhejiang 10, Shandong 9, Shanxi 8, Liaoning 7, Qingdao 7, Suiyuan 6, Guizhou 6, Xinjiang 4, Ningxia 3, Heilongjiang 3, Yunnan 3, Hong Kong 7, Philippines 2, Gansu 3, Qinghai 2, Jilin 1, Rehe 1, Batavia 1, Harbin 1, Shaanxi 1.

<h3>National Games News Broadcast Nationwide</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) With the opening of the National Games approaching, the vicinity of the Mausoleum is bustling with activity, and preparations are extremely busy. In order to quickly disseminate news, the organizing committee has installed broadcasting equipment in the venue and a shortwave radio station in the northeastern part of the track and field. It was installed on the 8th. The station directly broadcasts to the radio station.</p>
<h3>Selling News</h3>
<p>Guo Lianfeng Resigns and Hands Over to the Organizing Committee</p>
<p>Zhang Xinfu Denies Selling News</p>
<p>Printing House Also Denies Leaking</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) After Guo Lianfeng resigned due to debt, he went to the publicity division this morning to hand over the handover. Out of personal friendship, he entrusted Peng Baichuan to take over temporarily, but Peng was unwilling to accept. Guo left without regard, resulting in no one responsible for liaison in the publicity division. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, after persuasion from all parties, a car was sent to welcome Guo back to the venue, and the resignation issue was handed over to the organizing committee for resolution. According to Zhang Xinfu, a certain newspaper obtained the list of track and field groupings from the Mainland Printing House, which was printing the program, using journalistic means. After hearing about it, he immediately informed the publicity department to pay attention, so he is not responsible for the leak. Guo's remarks insulting him will be discussed by the organizing committee, and he will file a lawsuit in court. He has organized sports events more than once and knows many people in the news industry. He knows his character well and will never sell news. For the sake of national sports, he will not resign to avoid the suspension of meetings. The Mainland Printing House heard the news and signed a contract with the publicity department stipulating a fine of 25,000 yuan for leaking manuscripts. The department must execute the contract. Manager Ge of the printing house rushed to the venue and stated that all proofs and manuscripts were sent to the compilation and distribution division for proofreading, or staff were sent to the store to pick them up. There was no theft, and it is related to the reputation of businessmen and must be investigated according to law to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) After hearing about Guo Lianfeng's resignation on the evening of the 8th, Chu Minyi went to Guo's house to persuade him to stay, but Guo avoided meeting him, expressing his firm determination. The organizing committee colleagues decided to persuade him to come to the meeting to work on the morning of the 9th to avoid affecting the suspension of meetings.</p>

<h3>Sun Guiyun Does Not Run Sprints</h3>
<p>Only Participates in Basketball and Relay</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) Sun Guiyun, a well-known female general who represented Harbin in the last National Games and was famous for sprinting, studied in Beiping after the fall of the Northeast. Recently, she transferred to the Beiping Women's College of Arts and Sciences. On the eighth, she arrived in Nanjing with the team. Because she has not practiced sprinting for a long time, she only participates in basketball and relay.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting Held This Morning</h3>
<p>▲Competition Committee Meeting Held in the Evening</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) The organizing committee has scheduled a joint meeting at 9 AM on the 9th at the Lizhi Society. Letters have been sent to all unit leaders, all referees, all organizing committee members, and heads of all groups and divisions, requiring them to attend to discuss urgent matters to be carried out. The organizing committee has also scheduled a banquet for all competition committee members at the Central Hotel at 6 PM on the 9th, with the second meeting of the competition committee held at the Central Hotel at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Athletes Generally Unsatisfied with the Games' Hospitality</h3>
<p>▲Dormitories Lack Light and Air</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th dispatch) Athletes are generally dissatisfied with the hospitality of the Games because the dormitories lack light and air. In the toilets, water pipes are broken and water flows all over the floor. Athletes also have to transport their luggage themselves, which is worse than this year's North China Games.</p>
<h3>Two Demands from the Zhejiang Athletes</h3>
<p>Move Accommodation to Venue or Provide Transportation</p>
<p>Female Athletes Demand Prompt Improvement of Food</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) On the evening of the 8th, the Zhejiang team held a guidance meeting at the Central Hotel and resolved: (1) The men's athletes live in Zhongda, and the women's athletes live at the venue, which is inconvenient to manage. There are still vacancies in the dormitories at the venue, so why are those who came first not allowed to live in, while those who came later can live in because they registered in advance? This is unfair treatment. Please ask the hospitality division to find a way to move all those who came first to the stadium. If this is not possible, transportation should be provided to take the athletes to the stadium for sightseeing and must be provided every day during the conference period. (2) The women's meals at the venue cost four yuan per table of eight people, but the dishes are stale and inedible. Please improve them quickly to maintain hygiene.</p>
<h3>Whether Athletes Receive Care or Not</h3>
<p>There is a World of Difference</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th dispatch) At 8 AM on the morning of the 8th, male and female athletes from the Northeast, Qingdao, Shandong, and Hebei provinces were practicing track and field and ball sports in the track and field. The instructors diligently instructed them and worked tirelessly, which is admirable. The team leaders, instructors, managers, and team doctors from several provinces lived in the same dormitories as the athletes, taking great care of the athletes' daily lives. However, some opened rooms elsewhere in the city, neglecting the athletes. Comparing the two, there is a world of difference.</p>

<h3>Guangdong and Hong Kong Athletes Passed Through Shanghai Last Night En Route to Beijing</h3>
<p>▲Guangdong's Four Knights Feng, Tan, Chen Coming Down</p>
<p>▲Hong Kong Football Team to Compete Again in Shanghai</p>
<p>The much-anticipated Guangdong and Hong Kong delegations arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Guangdong delegation arrived by the Japanese Empress at 4 p.m. in the afternoon, and the Hong Kong delegation arrived on the Zazala Genera. Except for the Hong Kong football team, which played a friendly match in the afternoon, the rest were quiet and hurried to take the night express train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Guangdong</h3>
<p>Led by Jin Zengcheng, the entire delegation consists of 170 male and female athletes. It was previously reported that the "Four Knights" of the football team would represent Guangdong. Only Li Tiansheng and Qi Beihua arrived yesterday. Feng Liangxiang and Tan Jiangbai could not take leave due to work commitments, and Chen Zhenhe did not come either. The strength of the team has inevitably suffered. In addition to football, volleyball and swimming are the most promising events. The women's track and field team is also very well-rounded. They have high hopes for volleyball, basketball, and baseball. The roster of the football team is as follows: Huang Jiliang, Lu Shixian, Hu Tianbao, Ye Beihua, Li Jin, Li Tiansheng, Liu Qingcai, Zhu Guolun, Li Hongqing, Yang Shuiyi, Fu Jiaxing, Huang Binglang, Li Su, Ou Hongen, and Xiao Dianlian.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Led by Mo Yingyu, the entire delegation consists of 70 male and female athletes. They are most hopeful in football, volleyball, and baseball. After participating in the National Games, they will stay for a week after the closing ceremony. The football team will play one or two more matches. If there are no matches, they will return to Hong Kong in two or three days.</p>

<p>Java Junior Tennis Champion</p>
<h3>Xu Chengji Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Enter Beijing Tonight with Lin Xuyin</p>
<p>Will Go to Japan to Observe After Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>The two most noteworthy tennis players from Java, Xu Chengji and Lin Xuyin, arrived here from Batavia yesterday morning on the Chinara. They will take the night train to Beijing tonight and attend the opening ceremony of the National Games tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Climate and Venue Conditions</h3>
<p>Xu said that it is difficult to predict how he will perform this time because the weather in Nanyang is hotter, and he feels very cold here, so he is paying close attention to his physical condition. In addition, the venue conditions are also a factor. All the courts in Nanyang are hard cement courts. This time in Nanjing, I don't know if it will be grass or hard courts. The balls are often shot so that musicians exchange cards. Therefore, if I don't win, I can only say that I lack experience.</p>
<h3>Recent Results in Batavia</h3>
<p>Xu is only 21 years old and won the All-Java Championship again this year, defeating Japanese player Fujita in the final with scores of 6-2 and 6-3. Xu won the Central Java Championship in 1929, the All-Java Championship the following year, and the Java Overseas Chinese Championship in 1931 and 1932. This year, he won the All-Java Championship again. Xu and Lin teamed up to win the Java Doubles Championship this year. Lin is 32 years old, and his game is getting stronger as he gets older.</p>
<h3>Observations on the National Games Competition</h3>
<p>Regarding his confidence in the National Games championship, Xu said that he only found out after arriving here that the National Games only has three groups of competitions and the best of two wins. Regarding the semi-final against Shanghai, Xu will probably face Qiu Feihai. Xu said that he has defeated Qiu twice in Java. If it were still in Java, he would be confident of victory, but it is difficult to say in Nanjing because the climate, venue, and ball used are all factors. The match between Lin Xuyin and Wang Wenzheng will definitely be very intense. The doubles match between Xu and Lin against Zheng and Yu is also very promising.</p>
<h3>Returning to Shanghai and Then to Japan</h3>
<p>After returning to Shanghai from Beijing, he will stay for a week, play a few matches, and then go to Japan with Lin to travel and compete, in order to observe. There are many talented tennis players in Japan, and the same is true in Nanyang. Yamada of Japan is a friend of Xu's and has sent letters inviting them to play a practice match at St. John's University yesterday afternoon. They will practice elsewhere again today.</p>
<h3>Inviting Chinese and Foreign Guests to Visit the Venue</h3>
<p>▲Separate Group Badges Issued to Each School</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The reception group of the National Games invited Chinese and foreign guests and senior officials from various agencies to visit the venue, and also issued separate group badges at the request of various schools for admission.</p>
<h3>Hunan Athletes Hold Guidance Meeting</h3>
<p>The Hunan Provincial athletes asked Zhang Jing, director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, to come to the venue at 8 a.m. on the 8th to give instructions. The Anhui Provincial athletes scheduled a guidance meeting on the morning of the 8th to discuss ball game strategies and track and field guidance methods. Chen Wenjiao, Yang Jingze, and Wang Guiying were recommended to take an oath during the opening ceremony.</p>
<h3>Content of Banners Displayed at the Games</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The National Games also printed a large number of banners, which were distributed in the stadium area and important streets in the city. The content of the banners includes: (1) Promote national physical education and revitalize the national spirit; (2) A healthy nation requires healthy citizens; (3) Gather national athletes to engage in amateur sports; (4) Strengthen national sports to save the nation from peril.</p>
<h3>Health Group Begins Work</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) As athletes from various regions arrived in Nanjing one after another, the Health Group of the National Games set up its office at the track and field stadium. It has more than ten doctors assigned with various medicines, and formed six ambulance teams, each team with three doctors, health instructors, and nurses, and two ambulance boys. There is also a large ambulance in front of the stadium to meet emergency needs. In addition, the Police Department dispatched 60 policemen starting on the 8th, who are distributed along Zhongshan Gate to the stadium to maintain traffic order.</p>
<h3>Traffic Rules for the National Games</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) A person in charge of the National Games told reporters that traffic is important during the Games. The association has formulated traffic rules and designated parking lots, and hopes that car owners will inform their drivers to strictly abide by them to show caution. From 6 a.m. on the 10th, the route from Jing Tang Road to the stadium, passing through the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and back to Zhongshan Gate, will be a one-way street. It is hoped that various agencies will organize groups to visit to avoid crowding. Drivers who violate signs and police instructions will have their licenses revoked. The association has designated gas stations for refueling. Association staff will operate a car from the Central Hotel to the stadium every 20 minutes from 7 a.m. on the 10th, providing free transportation for staff and reporters. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Preferential Measures for Athletes to Send Telegrams</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) In order to give preferential treatment to athletes from various provinces and cities to send telegrams, the Games has specially calculated preferential measures. Athletes who send domestic telegrams to the temporary telegraph office set up inside the venue to report their whereabouts, daily life, and sports news will be charged according to the domestic social telegram method. The rate is calculated at 20 characters as the minimum per telegram, 2 cents for Chinese characters in the same province, 4 cents for European characters and codes, and double for telegrams to other provinces.

<h3>Hong Kong Team Passed Through Shanghai, Defeating the French Concession Team</h3>
<p>The Whole Team Was Exceptionally Fast, Especially Zheng Jiliang</p>
<p>The Result Was 2 to 1, and the French Concession Team Was Also Impressive</p>
<p>The Hong Kong football team, which is participating in the National Games, took the opportunity to pass through Shanghai on their way to Beijing yesterday and wished to play a match with the famous Western team of Shanghai. They arranged to fight the French Concession team at the China Baseball Field. As soon as the battle was announced, spectators flocked to the venue. The Hong Kong team relied on their crisp footwork and lively passing to win 2-1, defeating the strong French Concession team. It was a small test of their skills, and they were able to solve the problem with ease. The future is bright, and it can be expected. The team took the 11 p.m. special express train to Beijing last night. When the three heroes of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong compete for the championship, it will surely stir up the attention of the entire country.</p>
<h3>Zheng Jiliang Is a Talented Man</h3>
<p>It has been raining continuously for days, and the field is muddy and slippery, making it difficult to walk, let alone run. It is common to see people falling. If one doesn't become a mud figure, how can one show their bravery? Some players are good at playing on dry land or wet land, but it is more difficult to see their skills on wet land. Only those who can do both are truly all-around players. It can be seen that the strength of the Hong Kong team's players, who can maintain their usual agility on unstable ground, is strong. The most amazing player in the whole match was left winger Zheng Jiliang, whose skills were outstanding. He is not tall, but his muscles are strong, and he jumps and runs like a fly. He can dribble and pass with ease. It is no wonder that his every move is followed by cheers. The other ten players each have their own strengths, and they are all quick and agile. The opposing defense was tight; otherwise, how could there be such a small difference in the score?</p>
<h3>Parker's Performance Was Particularly Good</h3>
<p>The talent of the French Concession team is amazing. Parker, a famous player from the West, was also recruited to their team. In the Group A matches, he has shown a strong presence. Yesterday, Parker held a central position, making the interior as solid as a fortress, making it difficult to attack. Goalkeeper Fulushou was also very dutiful. However, the ball was lost after it touched his fingers and then hit the goalpost and went into the net, which was a careless mistake. The second goal was due to the fact that the defenders had to join in a single group at the intersection of short lanes, which left the goal wide open, resulting in the fall. This was a mistake. The forwards are very sharp, but it is difficult to move freely under the strict surveillance of the other side. Overall, the French Concession team is indeed formidable.</p>

<h3>Each Team Tied in the Face of a Strong Opponent</h3>
<p>The French Concession team kicked off with fierce momentum. The three central players showed their magical powers. Hong Kong's inner guards were strict, and the goalkeeper was experienced, so they were able to turn the danger into safety. Hong Kong's left winger Zheng Jiliang was as fast as a flying horse, rushing into the formation and often creating a terrifying situation. If it were not for Parker's central command, the overall situation would have been unimaginable. After repeated unsuccessful attacks, they changed their strategy. Bao Jiaping, a nationally renowned goalkeeper who was transferred to center forward, suddenly kicked the ball from 25 yards away with a quick and decisive move, scoring the first goal. However, five minutes later, a strange change occurred. Hong Kong had already gained the advantage, and the inner guards also moved to the front, leaving the interior empty. Right winger Beige took the opportunity to invade, and goalkeeper Lin Tianchu stood up and made a trapped beast gate. The matter went against the intention, and he was also lost. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<h3>Played to Their Full Strength and Won 2 to 1</h3>
<p>In the second half, Hong Kong's right winger Wu Baoqu did not fail to meet his mission. He dribbled the ball to the right wing, turned around and crossed the ball. Liang Darong hesitated for a moment, and the golden opportunity was lost. At that time, the momentum of the Hong Kong team was unstoppable. Five tigers surrounded the gate, and they attacked one after another. The entire French Concession army was transferred back, and they were distributed at key points. Ten strikes and ten parries caused the world to change color. After a stalemate of 15 minutes, the situation eased slightly.

<p>Liang, made a kick on the left side, which was inserted into the hinterland, and the situation became urgent again. After two or three passes, Liang Darong shot at the goal, taking the lead 2 to 1. The French Concession team was led by Parker and launched several counterattacks, but they were eventually rejected. Bao Jiaping was injured once, but he continued to fight with all his strength, and the audience applauded non-stop. Huang Shunmei was exceptionally brave, charging into battle. He shot at the goal, and Fulushou gained and lost it again. Liang Darong chased up and shot in, but it was invalidated due to offside. After 70 minutes of competition, the result was that Hong Kong won 2 to 1.</p>

<h3>Personnel Determined for National Games Race Walking Performance</h3>
<p>The Chinese Race Walking Association, in order to select talents to participate in the National Games performance, conducted another full-distance practice yesterday. In addition to Zhou Yu Yu, Hou Genren, Zhang Zaojiu, Lu Yutian, and You Zhaoxiang being there to take care of them and correct their posture, the number of registered race walkers reached 60, which was exceptionally enthusiastic. They departed at 7:30 a.m., and over 45 people reached the finish line, which was a good result. However, the number of people sent to perform this time is a total of 45 people (including staff), and the round-trip travel expenses have been handled by the Municipal Education Bureau, so there is no way to add more. Therefore, the association had to leave behind those whose posture was lacking and whose speed was slower. Those who were selected were required to purchase blue short-sleeved shirts and gray trousers from the Laoximen Standard Sports Equipment Company to ensure uniformity. The price for race walkers is low. The names and positions of the participating staff and performers are recorded as follows (if anyone is unable to go, the alternates will replace them):</p>
<p>▲Team Leader, Shi Youhui (replaced by Lu Yutian), Manager Zhou Yu Yu, Instructor Shi Jinsheng, Secretary Wu Rongbai, Ma Jun,</p>
<p>▲Team Members, Zhang Zaojiu (Captain), Lv Chongyi, Cai Zhengyi, Zhou Ruquan, Lv Wenxia, Xu Aichen, Zheng Xingen, Yao Yaying, Zheng Chengshan, Zhang Hongsheng, Li Yamin, Jin Youliang, Sun Shouchao, Zhuang Wenbin, Sun Jinxiang, Du Shangwen, Yang Derun, Zhang Xianlun, Yao Zhenmin, Tang Wenyi, Wang Zhaoxiang, Huang Xiongfu, Cheng Xuan, Qiu Dechang, Zhang Zhihe, Li Li, Lin Qiu, Qian Qiming, Liu Bingren, Liu Lingan, Chen Liwen, Yuan Genshan, Ge Jinwen, Ge Zhonggao, Ding Jin, Xu Yucheng, Zhou Jiahong, Ni Pinshan, Yang Jun, Wang Shizhen.

<h3>Shanghai Bank Sells Admission Tickets on Behalf</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 8th) The National Games admission tickets, both full-period and single-entry types, are entrusted to the Shanghai Bank for sale. The bank has also set up a temporary branch inside the venue, and the deployment has been completed. In order to increase audience interest, it has specially printed 15,000 copies of the National Games booklet to be distributed inside the venue.</p>

<p>Farewell to Staff Member at Diligent Bookstore</p>
<p>Pole Vault King Fu Baolu</p>
<p>Mr. Fu Baolu, a document clerk in the editorial department of the Diligent Bookstore, was the record holder for pole vaulting in the previous National Games. Since joining the editorial department, he has taken advantage of the athletics field of the National Sports Advancement Association to practice pole vaulting and the decathlon with extraordinary effort after work. Currently, he is set to break records in Shanghai and amaze everyone. This time, he is attending the National Games, creating new records, striving for the championship, and bringing honor to Shanghai. It is almost certain he will win. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai army mobilized. At dawn, the North Railway Station was already crowded. At 7:15, four or five cars arrived like lightning. The car doors opened, and the pole vault king Fu Baolu was seen holding a long pole, carrying a leather suitcase, and wearing half-military attire, truly living up to his title. He was immediately surrounded by the staff of the bookstore and escorted into the station. Leading the way was a large banner from the bookstore saying, "Diligent Bookstore bids farewell to staff member pole vault king Fu Baolu, who is going to win the championship." It was particularly lively. Ordinary travelers and athletes alike pointed and admired Fu. Fu greeted his friends and acquaintances with frequent handshakes. When boarding the train, reporters took photos of him with the bookstore staff. It was later learned that the bookstore staff who came to see him off included the sales director Zhang Guangzong, the accounting director Zhou Shubei, the editors Ruan Weicun and Shao Ruhan, the document clerk Wu Qianlu, and staff members Wang Yuqi, Qin Jiaju, Yan Jikuan, Yu Jian, and more than twenty others. When the wheels rumbled at eight o'clock, the pole vault king jumped onto the train, waving his hat to say goodbye to the well-wishers, and headed to Beijing to win the championship.</p>

<h3>YMCA Heated Swimming Pool to Open Regularly</h3>
<p>▲ Starting from the 21st of this month</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has added swimming pool facilities to heat the pool water, making it possible to practice in all seasons.

Those who have registered must pay the fee by the 20th. It is reported that the association has special preferential measures for schools and organizations, reducing membership fees to show its promotion of swimming.</p>
<h3>Differences Between National Martial Arts at the National Games and National Examinations - Jin Yiming</h3>
<p>The article "[My Views on Martial Arts Performances and Examinations]" published in a certain newspaper in the capital on the 2nd should have originally been titled "[Differences Between National Martial Arts Competitions and Examinations]". The editor of the newspaper's column changed the title to "[My Views on Martial Arts Performances and Examinations]", which makes people almost suspect that there is only performance without competition, or only competition without performance. This is far from the topic and the facts. I will now briefly describe the differences between the National Games and the National Examinations.</p>
<p>I previously read the two letters exchanged by Mr. Chu and Mr. Zhang. Regarding their different views on martial arts competitions and examinations, my views are divided into two categories, A and B.</p>
<p>Category A: Designed specifically for competition</p>
<p>(1) Combat trials (2) Wrestling trials (3) Sanda trials</p>
<p>(4) Trials with the same weapons (5) Trials with different weapons (6) Unarmed combat</p>
<p>Category B: Designed specifically for performance, such as</p>
<p>(1) Unarmed performance (2) Partner performance (3) Unarmed group performance</p>
<p>(4) Single weapon performance (5) Partner weapon performance (6) Weapon group performance</p>
<p>For the purpose of promoting modern national martial arts, Mr. Zhang advocated that people of all schools compete together to determine the winner. He used the analogy of letting everyone play the yu to listen. Therefore, the examination details mainly specify Category A, and Category B is brief and simplified. What he emphasizes is this rather than that.</p>
<p>For the purpose of organizing modern national martial arts, Mr. Chu advocated classifying them into different categories and holding the same competitions to determine the best. He used the analogy of the same ball games. Therefore, Category B is the main focus in his words and lines, and Category A is also taken into account. What he emphasizes is this rather than that.</p>
<p>People should first understand the positions of the two gentlemen. One is for politics and military affairs, and the other is for politics and education. Although their advocacy has slight differences in emphasis, they both promote national martial arts. If readers stubbornly insist that their opinions are contrary, they will inevitably ignore the original intention of those who enthusiastically promote them. In my opinion, the competition details of the National Games do not have to be completely the same as the National Examinations, and the examination details of the National Examinations may not be completely different from the competition. However, the emphasis on judges and referees is slightly different. Modern national martial arts is still in the stage of organization and development. Although there are people with skills and techniques who know what kind of teaching materials are applicable to the academic or military circles, there are no clear regulations. Moreover, even if regulations that are rarely changed are drawn up, the current use of the B-type performance is suitable for competitions of the same style of boxing and weapons. Judges should determine the quality and can also adopt trial methods to determine the winner. For those who apply the A-type trial method, it is appropriate to gather the most skilled and unique individuals. Referees should determine the winner and can also use pre-trial performances to determine the quality. I am restating my humble opinion on the matter and asking for your wise judgment.</p>

<h3>Preparatory Committee for the Construction of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Construction of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College held its fourth meeting at the Ministry of Education from 4 PM to 7 PM on the 5th. Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Zhu Jiahua, Shen Pengfei, Jiao Yitang, Xin Zhi, and Wang Shijie (participants) attended. Yu Youren chaired the meeting, and Shen Pengfei took the minutes. (Reported Matters) (1) At the previous meeting, Committee Member Xin Shuzhi was elected as the president of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College. However, Committee Member Xin strongly declined the position, and it was difficult to find a suitable person to fill the position in a short time. The preparatory work for the school could not be delayed, so the two standing committee members, Dai and Yu, decided to temporarily hire Mr. Wang Yutang as the director of the agricultural college's preparation, in order to facilitate the progress. He is currently in Shaanxi with Professor Fen and Professor Ci'er to handle the preparation of the school site and school buildings. (Matters for Discussion) (1) Ratification of the appointment of Mr. Wang Yutang as the director of the agricultural college's preparation. (Resolution) Passed. (2) The director of the agricultural college's preparation requested the issuance of an official seal. (Resolution) The committee will forward the request to the Ministry of Education to issue a seal for the preparatory office. (3) Confirmation of the procedures for receiving and disbursing funds for the preparatory office. (Resolution) The committee will inform the preparatory office to prepare a budget and submit it to the committee for review. Expenditures within the budget will be approved by the standing committee members. Special expenses exceeding the budget should be submitted to the committee for approval. (4) Preparation of the budget for this year. (Resolution) The director of the agricultural college's preparation should be asked to prepare the budget for this year when he returns to Beijing, and submit it to the committee for review and then forward it to the Ministry of Education.

(Resolution) Preparatory staff member Guo Xujing died in the line of duty and was approved to be buried on the school grounds. The burial expenses were approved to be borne by the school on an actual reimbursement basis. (8) Committee Member Li Shizeng proposed that preparatory staff member Guo Xujing participated in the preparatory work of the agricultural college and fell ill due to overwork in Wugong. His family was very poor, and his three children had no funds for education. He proposed that the committee decide to provide assistance. (Resolution) The staff member's monthly salary will be paid until the end of October. In addition, a pension equal to six months' salary will be paid from November. (9) Professor Fen Ci'er requested that the budget for the forest farm's water conservancy and other items be approved, and also requested that Paul Gerk be hired as the director of the Water Conservancy Research Institute. (Resolution) The forest farm budget of 6,500 yuan per month was approved according to the proposal submitted by Professor Fen Ci'er. Regarding the request to hire Paul Gerk as the director of the Water Conservancy Research Institute, it should be requested that the two standing committee members Yu and Dai contact the General Staff and other departments to borrow him while he continues to be paid by his original organization.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Dispatch a Large Number of Inspectors in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>In order to effectively promote and supervise vocational education, normal education, compulsory education, and mass education in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education previously appointed two commissioners, one department director, two counselors, and four inspectors (also one inspector concurrently serving as a section chief), and two section chiefs to go to various provinces and cities for inspection (one person may be assigned to one province and city or more than two provinces, depending on the situation). The names of the provinces and cities to which each person was assigned have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now heard that the Ministry of Education has separately instructed each person. Except for Section Chief Wu Yan, who will depart at the end of the month for inspection, Inspector Zhong Daozan (Zi Zhixiu) in Nanjing, and Department Director Gu Shusen (Zi Yinting) in Shanghai, who can depart at any time due to their proximity, the remaining nine people, including the commissioners, counselors, inspectors, and section chiefs, are generally scheduled to depart for inspection around the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Implements Agricultural Education Measures in Bandit-Controlled Areas</h3>
<p>(Nanjing Correspondence) Cheng Shizui, the director of the Jiangxi Education Department, previously received an order from the provincial government to draft implementation measures for rural education in the recovered bandit-controlled areas. He immediately followed the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and paid attention to the key points, and drafted a draft of the Jiangxi Province's Educational Implementation Measures for the Recovered Bandit-Controlled Areas, which was submitted to the provincial government for review and implementation at the provincial affairs meeting. The measures have approximately two goals: (1) To train the general public and children to thoroughly understand the crimes of the Red bandits and the fallacies of their arguments, so as to firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People and love the country. (2) To train the general public and children to have civic cultivation, self-defense capabilities, and production skills, so as to ensure social stability and people's prosperity. In each recovered county, at least twelve mass schools should be established, divided into children's classes and adult classes. At the same time, mass school teacher training institutes should be established, and mass reading materials and teaching materials should be compiled and printed. The required expenses will be subsidized from public funds in the recovered counties of the bandit-controlled areas. In the recovered counties of the semi-bandit-controlled areas, half of the expenses will be raised locally and half will be subsidized from public funds. Wherever the bandit suppression troops have arrived, schools will be established accordingly, without adhering to rigid rules, with the goal of ensuring that children have access to education and that adult men have the opportunity to receive remedial education.</p>

<p>▲ Currently Investigating the Situation of Autonomous Student Associations in Various Secondary Schools</p>
<p>In order to improve its organization, the Shanghai Municipal Secondary School Student Federation is currently conducting a survey of the autonomous student associations in various secondary schools in the city. According to the federation, some secondary school autonomous student associations have not yet been re-elected, so the federation's re-election congress for this semester is difficult to determine at this time.</p>
<h3>Navy Department Assigns Returned British Students</h3>

<h3>Zhu Kezhen Discusses His Impressions of Visiting the Chicago World's Fair</h3>
<p>▲ A Manchurian Pavilion is Placed Next to the Japanese Pavilion</p>
<p>▲ Even Peiping is Included in the Manchurian Territory</p>
<p>Dr. Zhu Kezhen, during the recent Chinese Science Society meeting, discussed his impressions of visiting the Chicago World's Fair, saying, "This time I attended the Pacific Conference and conveniently visited the Chicago World's Fair. Apart from the science museum's displays, which are very valuable, most of the other displays are more like games. For example, models of ancient organisms from thousands of years ago are made to move and call out, which is very interesting. The Chinese pavilion is well decorated, and the exhibits are also very precious. The Japanese pavilion only focuses on promotion, with silk and tea as the main products. The most hateful thing is that a Manchurian pavilion is placed next to the Japanese pavilion. The map displayed even includes Peiping in the Manchurian territory. The Japanese are trying to mislead international public opinion in every possible way."</p>

<h3>Professor Tan Dreler Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Over the years, President Yan of the National Shanghai Medical College has spared no effort in improving teaching and hiring famous professors. Recently, he submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to invite Dr. Tan Dreler, a full professor of anatomy at the University of Vienna in Austria, to teach at the college. After half a year of correspondence, the University of Vienna, known as the world's most prestigious school of anatomy, and Mr. Tan, who has been teaching there for thirty years and has written numerous works, is recognized as the authority on anatomical science. Professor Bumei of the Shanghai Medical College also studied under him. It is now learned that Mr. Tan arrived in Shanghai yesterday and was accompanied to the college by Professor Bu. He brought with him many anatomical specimens, which he distributed to the professors, lecturers, assistant teachers, technicians, and students of the college's anatomy department for research. With his gray hair and dignified appearance, he is worthy of respect. It is also heard that the college has invited Dr. Bigger, a world-renowned authority on pathology and a full professor of pathology at the University of Berlin in Germany, who will also arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Ping Library Exhibits Rare Books of Maps and Paintings</h3>
<p>Old Maps Have a Significant Relationship to Historical Geography and Archeology</p>
<p>Woodcuts Include a Golden-Inscribed Buddhist Scripture Discovered in Shanxi</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) Libraries often focus on books and neglect maps, but in reality, the importance of maps and illustrations is no less than that of books. In particular, maps are crucial to academic research and political education. The Peiping Library boasts one of the richest collections of maps in the country. In addition to its collection of illustrated books and printed materials, it has established a special Cartography Department to collect and organize various maps, both old and new. Its current holdings include over two thousand types and more than ten thousand copies, making it a rare treasure trove for academic research. However, the library has traditionally held a book exhibition every year on Double Tenth Day, and the exhibits have mostly consisted of books with few maps, and even fewer map exhibitions. Therefore, the library is holding a special map and print exhibition on this year's Double Tenth Day to promote these items and draw public attention. It is reported that the displayed maps are categorized and arranged in roughly chronological order, so that viewers can gain a clear understanding of the nature and evolution of Chinese maps. This can be considered an academic exhibition, different from general exhibitions that focus solely on novelty and innovation. The maps on display include old-style maps of various provinces and regions from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, Qing dynasty latitude and longitude maps, Ming and Qing dynasty border defense, river and water conservancy, and post road maps, Qing dynasty boundary maps, Ming dynasty city and palace maps, and Yuanmingyuan palace maps, all of which have a great relationship with historical geography and archeology. The newer maps include detailed maps newly surveyed and drawn by the army surveying bureaus, water conservancy bureaus, construction departments, and naval hydrographic offices of various provinces, as well as maps surveyed and drawn by foreigners, many of which are rarely seen elsewhere. Ordinary maps made by various domestic geographical societies and individuals are also selectively displayed for comparison. The library's special collection of Ming and Qing dynasty painted maps from the Qing Cabinet Grand Archives, as well as newly purchased rare old maps that are not normally open to public viewing, are also being selected and showcased to the public. This is a rare opportunity. In addition, the History Museum, the Peiping Research Institute, the Geological Survey, and Wang Xiyin, Wang Shenbo, and Zhang Jingsu are also selecting their valuable maps for inclusion in the exhibition. Regarding the printmaking aspect, in addition to prints in novels, dramas, local chronicles, and painting manuals carved in the Ming and Qing dynasties, and copperplate martial arts maps using Western painting techniques from the early Qing Qianlong period, there are also various prints from Buddhist scriptures. Zheng Xidi, Wang Xiaoci, Zhu Guizuo, and others are also adding their rare and valuable illustrated books to the exhibition. Among the exhibits by Zheng, there are more than 130 Buddhist scriptures, mostly prints of Buddhist and Taoist scriptures. Therefore, the library has specially selected one or two copies of various Buddhist and Taoist scriptures carved since the Song Dynasty as samples for comparison and reference. It is reported that there are samples of golden-inscribed Buddhist scriptures newly discovered in Shanxi, which are truly rare treasures. In addition, the library's collection of Ming and Qing paintings is also being exhibited as an adjunct. If the exhibition space is sufficient, various well-printed archeological maps from foreign countries will also be selectively displayed.</p>

<h3>A Lover of Genius Theory</h3>
<p>— Ou Bi</p>
<p>The discovery of a genius is ultimately not an easy thing. If you're lucky, you might be discovered during your lifetime. If you're unlucky, you might be discovered after your death. In that case, the genius himself won't see the discovery. If that genius has long seen that he is a genius, but because no one has discovered him, he dies with regret, isn't that terribly tragic?</p>
<p>So if you know you're a genius, it's best to say it yourself. If you're too embarrassed to say it directly, you can use some other hints.</p>
<p>For example, you can say that you've always been a lover of genius theory.</p>
<p>What does it mean to be a lover of genius theory? Probably genius theory discusses how geniuses are produced and what geniuses will do, and you are a person who loves this theory. You love it, and at the same time, you are gradually becoming one of the people it discusses.</p>
<p>For example, the production of genius is half due to heredity and half due to education, and you certainly know that your paternal line is outstanding and your maternal line is also excellent, and there is a great possibility of producing a genius.</p>
<p>As for education, needless to say, you have received the most complete education, so complete that it is impossible for you not to become a genius, even if you don't want to.</p>
<p>And you have also paid tribute to Shakespeare's grave or visited Dante's hometown.</p>
<p>So, undoubtedly, you are a genius.</p>
<p>But what if people just don't realize you're a genius? Well, as I said above, you can only hint at it yourself. You write "A Lover of Genius Theory," then you write about heredity and education in relation to genius, then you write "Genius Office," then you write "Genius"... In short, you start with genius and end with genius. You have to talk and write in such a way that people will believe that you are a genius and that genius is you.</p>
<p>Now, in the eyes of others, you are not only a lover of genius theory, you are indeed genius itself.</p>
<h3>[Worries of a Common Man]</h3>
<p>— Zhui Feng</p>
<p>| To Mr. Qian Gechuan |</p>
<p>Some time ago, a Mr. Li published an article in Free Talk entitled [English Is Not Common in Europe], criticizing some of the absurd words of Mr. Qian Gechuan, a promoter of Basic English. Subsequently, Mr. Qian published his reply [There Is Nothing to Worry About] in a certain newspaper. He did not mention whether Mr. Li's words were correct, but instead conducted a very detailed study of Mr. Li's place of origin. To sum up the meaning of the article, Mr. Li is from Taiwan, and Taiwanese people have no right to comment on the Basic English advocated by Mr. Qian. Leaving aside all personal attacks, the logic of that article alone is enough to amaze people. And it also scolds the Taiwanese people for having no backbone. The original text said: [roughly saying that although he (Zheng Chenggong) occupied Taiwan for a while, he could not keep it. After several wars, it would inevitably perish to a foreign race in the Sino-Japanese War. But 270 years after that, a patriot appeared in Taiwan, and the world has been full of troubles ever since. I (Qian Gechuan) felt at the time that Korea was full of patriots for its independence movement. Taiwan suffered the same abuse from the Japanese, but there was no famous person after Zheng Chenggong. This is probably just Zheng Gong's hope, and it is not necessarily a reliable prediction.] and so on.</p>
<p>After reading such unwarranted insults to the Taiwanese people, even I, who am unwilling to ask about the rights and wrongs of the Basic English movement, cannot but come out and say a few words.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Qian studied in Japan for a few years and is naturally very familiar with Japanese affairs. Taiwan is also included, so Mr. Qian can clearly determine that [there have been no famous people since Zheng Chenggong]. However, perhaps because Basic English has a teacher from the higher normal school as its backing, and Taiwanese history cannot find a teacher from the Orient who is willing to tell the truth, Mr. Qian has no choice but to rely on his own intelligence to make a unique judgment? I don't want to talk nonsense with Mr. Qian now, I will just point out some historical facts to Mr. Qian. If Mr. Qian has any doubts, then please go to the Tokyo Hibiya Library and look up a few books on Sino-Japanese war records.</p>
<p>When the Qing government ceded Taiwan to the Japanese, the Taiwanese people elected Tang Jingsong as the president and Liu Yongfu as the vice president to organize the Republic of Taiwan and fight against the Japanese. With a small island and more than 2.7 million people, they resisted the world's newest country, killed Prince Yoshihisa Kitashirakawa, the commander of the Konoe Division, and made the Japanese feel cold. They negotiated with the Beijing government, saying that the Taiwanese were resisting, and Japan could not accept Taiwan. If the Qing court did not control the Taiwanese, they would invade Beijing. Li Hongzhang was so frightened that he ordered Tang Jingsong by telegram: [Taiwan is resisting and Beijing is in danger, pack up and return to the country]. In order to protect its country, the Qing court sent Taiwan to the Japanese. However, after Tang and Liu fled at night, the Taiwanese people still formed teams to resist the Japanese, and Li Jingfang could not land to hand over the territory. Can our learned Mr. Qian erase this tragic historical fact full of blood and tears with one stroke? In addition, please ask our Mr. Qian to look at the historical facts after the Sino-Japanese War...</p>
<p>1895 (Lin Daobei case) 1896 (Liu Deshuo case)</p>
<p>1898 (Chen Fa case) 1901 (Zhan Arui case)</p>
<p>1907 (Cai Qinlin case) 1912 (Liu Qian case)</p>
<p>1912 (Huang Chao case) 1912 (Chen Ayao case)</p>
<p>1912 (Luo Fuxing case) 1913 (Zhang Huelu case)</p>
<p>1913 (Li Aqi case) 1913 (Lai Lai case)</p>
<p>1914 (Luo Atou case) 1915 (Yu Qingfang case)</p>
<p>According to Japanese court statistics, from 1895 to 1906, the number of people executed by the court for independence movements reached 3,518, not counting those killed in battle or by military police. In the Yu Qingfang case alone, 866 people were executed. (Not counting the burning and killing of women and children) From 1921 to the end of September 1933, I don't know how many people were imprisoned for independence movements. Facing such tragic sacrifices, does Mr. Qian Gechuan, who has the same ancestors as the Taiwanese, dare to say again that [there have been no famous people since Zheng Chenggong]? According to Mr. Qian Gechuan's statement, then, forty years later, the Zhonghua Book Company can ask Mr. Qian to compile a record of Manchuria again, saying that there have been no famous people in the four eastern provinces since they were occupied by the Japanese, and that the anti-Japanese war history of Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, and many other volunteer armies should be erased! This may be the greatest glorious career that Mr. Qian thinks is! Finally, I have to ask Mr. Qian a few things...</p>
<p>(1) Were Taiwanese people Chinese before? By what qualifications does Mr. Qian laugh at compatriots who are suffering from foreign trampling?</p>
<p>(2) Why are people who have lived in Taiwan not qualified to criticize Basic English? But those who have lived in Koishikawa, Tokyo, are qualified to introduce it?</p>
<h3>Huang Tingjian and the Jiangxi Poetry School</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Huang Tingjian did not dislike vulgarity when writing lyrics, but he liked to use awkward sentences and obscure allusions when writing poetry. His lyrics did not avoid accusations of encouraging lewdness, but when teaching people how to write poetry, he said to read scriptures and study Taoism. Like Ouyang Xiu, he seemed to express two personalities in two literary forms. However, his poems had the greatest influence on later poets.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty, Lü Juren thought that he had obtained the mantle of Huang Tingjian and Chen Shidao, and created a Jiangxi School Genealogy. He listed Huang and Chen below, Xie Yi, Xie Mai, Han Ju, Li Peng, Chao Chongzhi, etc., a total of twenty-five people, and called them the Jiangxi Poetry School. Fang Hui of the Yuan Dynasty called Du Fu as the one ancestor, Huang Tingjian, Chen Shidao, and Chen Yuyi as the three founders in Yingkui Luicui, and the Jiangxi Poetry School was further established.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, rather than saying that Huang Tingjian's poems imitated Du Fu, it is better to say that he imitated Han Yu. His father (Huang Shu) wrote poems imitating Han Yu. He himself did not shy away from learning from Han, although he also mentioned learning from Du at the same time. I think Han Yu's poems are stiff and obscure, which is a reaction from the Eight Dynasties to the High Tang Dynasty, when the five-character and seven-character poems had reached a ripe stage. Song Dynasty poets, in addition to using lyrics as a new poetic form, had to avoid the scope of the Tang people if they wanted to write poetry. To avoid the ripe old path of the Tang people, they had to choose a stiff path to take. Although this was also a path taken by the Han Yu school, there were few successful writers who could be considered to have taken the path, which was no different from a new path. Huang Tingjian grasped this trend and climbed to become the first new writer on the road to success. Chen Shidao followed Huang Tingjian and also climbed the road to success. From then on, poets who wanted to take this stiff path had to forget their ancestors and just push Huang and Chen as the first ancestors. It just so happened that Huang and Chen were both born in Jiangxi, so they were called the Jiangxi Poetry School.</p>
<h3>Ganpu Correspondence (2)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Brother ○○...</p>
<p>If you want to come to Ganpu to see the salt area, you must pass through Ganpu City. Therefore, before talking about life in the salt area, a description of Ganpu Town is necessary. Because of this reason, I stayed in the city for a day before going to the countryside. In Shanghai, before the January 28th Incident, when friends came to visit, I always advised them to go to Wusong Town or Doushan to see the ancient houses of the Ming Dynasty and to see how the ancient heroes could fly over walls. Now the heroes can only look at the thirteen-story buildings of the French Concession and the twenty-two-story buildings of the Racecourse and sigh. I don't want to say this anymore when friends come again. If they're free, I want them to come to Ganpu to see it, because there are older houses here than the ancient houses destroyed by the Japanese imperialist artillery fire in Shanghai, ancient city walls that you can't see in Shanghai, where people who hold poles high can always jump over, typical ancient streets, clocks that are more ancient than Zhaofeng Park, and the relics of Qin Shihuang, the concubines of Shihuang, Sun Quan, Wang Yangming, Wu Linzheng, and many immortals and heroes, although there are also many more modern buildings, as well as "Da Ci" and "Meili" brand cigarettes.</p>
<p>This market town belonging to Haiyan County, the eastern port mentioned in the [Three Principles of the People], does have many characteristics in common with other ancient cities. The area of this town is about 10,000 mu, 16.88 kilometers away from Haiyan. The total population is 34,221, 17,751 males and 16,470 females. Only six or seven thousand people live in the city. Most of the people are salt workers. In addition to salt, the products include ramie cloth (coarse ramie cloth that can only be used to make curtains), plums, peaches, and bamboo shoots. Rice can produce 70,000 dan per year, and tea can produce 100 dan. As a result of investigations in the city, there are several points that particularly surprised me. First, there are 40 temples in the entire area, only one complete primary school, no middle schools, and it is said that there are 13 elementary and substitute elementary schools, and 10 institutions. Proportionally, there are two too many things in this place, one is that there are too many temples, and the other is that there are too many institutions. Second, it is very regrettable that the people's political beliefs are very weak. According to the statistics of political institutions, one form records that there are only five Kuomintang members in the entire area, while another form records nine men and two women, a total of eleven people. According to the latter calculation, there is one Kuomintang member out of every 3,111 people. Third, according to the survey form, there are 7,426 married men and 7,355 married women, 8,918 unmarried men and 6,510 unmarried women, 1,407 widowers and 2,605 widows, and absolutely no divorces. What do you think about these numbers?</p>
<p>Let's talk about education in particular. In the city, there are three schools in total: Chengnan Elementary School, Haimen Elementary School, and Ganpu Elementary School. There are a total of more than 200 students in the three schools, and a total of six or seven teachers, including one female teacher and dozens of female students. Of these three schools, only Chengnan has two grades, and the equipment is the most complete here. The buildings and equipment are no less than those of public elementary schools in Shanghai. According to statistics, among school-age children, 1,150 males and 117 females are enrolled. Among school-age children, 1,757 males and 2,245 females are not enrolled. Among those over 13 years old, 8,807 males and 11,693 females are illiterate. There are 327 men and 93 women who graduated from elementary school and studied in private schools for more than five years. There are 24 men and 1 woman who graduated from middle school or above. What do educators think about these numbers listed here? And the current number is not necessarily accurate.</p>
<p>The market here is not big, with only about a hundred shops, the largest of which is only one foreign goods shop, with an annual business of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and the others are very small. Although it is next to the Hu-Song Highway, everything is somewhat similar to inland towns with inconvenient transportation. It is as black as crows everywhere. According to the results of investigations here, the oppression of feudal forces is equally strong, and the common people are crying out in pain. The two points that most stimulated us in a day of city life are the ringing of the horns of the gentry's chartered cars and the officials' sedan chairs rushing around in the streets. Not knowing what's good for us, we even clashed with a sedan carrier of some kind of committee in the evening. In the eyes of the people of Ganpu, our actions were already against the heavens. If we didn't have the prestige of Shanghai people, we would have suffered for it. However, the one we clashed with was still the sedan carrier of some kind of committee. Brother ○○, this is Ganpu Cape that I want to introduce to you. A Ying, August 16th</p>
<h3>One Page of Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— French Philip Translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>She seemed not to notice the real reason she had lured Henri Delhomme here. In the space of a few seconds, Henri Delhomme, while pouring his uncontrollable appetite on this girl, stood with one hand on her shoulder, carefully admiring her, tasting her in advance. But she looked like she didn't know anything.</p>
<p>According to her, when she was working in Meulan, she had a more beautiful kitchen. There, she was working as a maid in the house of Judge Ludondu. That kitchen was not paved with bricks like it is now, but was made of wood. If you weren't afraid of catching a cold, you could walk barefoot on it without getting dirty. The house was very fancy. She only quit because the wife died. The wife had been sick for a long time. She had a disease where her stomach was upside down. As soon as she ate something, it would fall into her stomach immediately. Therefore, there was no way to digest it. The wife was a Spanish beauty.</p>
<p>Indeed, women are not like men; women are not as narrow-minded as men. Henri Delhomme thought. But what is it inside women that makes them so talkative? It seems that women's bodies are filled with words that must be spoken. What difference does it make whether they talk about Mr. Ludondu, Mrs. Ludondu, death, or the kitchen! However, Marie kept talking like this.</p>
<p>When she was in Meulan, she met Berthe. This Berthe is now working as a maid in the house of Pastor Val. At that time, they lived on the same street. They also had a friend named Hortense, who was a very honest and good girl. Even later, Hortense often sent them postcards. But Marie discovered that the postcards sent to Berthe always had light, while those sent to herself did not have light. Since discovering this fact, she never replied to her again.</p>
<p>Henri Delhomme patiently listened to her talk about the postcards. Because his appetite was excessively excited. So no matter how tasteless the words were, once they entered his head, they were like drops of water falling on a hot stone, and they would evaporate dimly and disappear immediately. At this time, he could happily bite, chew, eat, and swallow Marie. If there were Latin words hidden in her intestines, they would be digested together.</p>
<p>He stroked between the girl's shirt and the skin of her neck with one hand. The temperature of her flesh was truly comfortable. It was like the meat eaten during a festival. Meat or girl, if you don't eat it quickly, it will get cold.</p>
<p>Did she know this too? She said...</p>

<p>She walked over to the chair, sat down, and began to peel them. He followed her over. Henri's hand slipped down from the front and now slipped up from the back. She was peeling potatoes. Her back and chest were equally warm. But to Henri, she seemed cold and uneasy. He pressed her with his palm, trying not to let her warmth turn cold. Even so, he still wanted to say to her...</p>

<h3>The Past of the Financial Industry and Future Trends by Wang Yu-tong</h3>
<p>If we want to ascertain whether a society's economy is stable, we must first determine whether the financial industry's structure is sound. This is because the financial business is the driving force of the social economy, and all economic needs of society are met by it. In the past, China's financial institutions were mainly the "piaohao" (traditional Chinese draft banks) and "qianzhuang" (money shops). After the emergence of modern banks, the center of financial gravity gradually shifted to the banks. Since then, when people refer to the financial world, they are represented by banks. However, in recent years, due to political instability and the country's financial difficulties, with expenditures exceeding income, heavy taxes, and the social economy already showing signs of decline. After the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), various provinces along the Yangtze River suffered frequent floods. The whole country was gasping for breath under the unprecedented suffering of natural disasters and epidemics. Unexpectedly, not long after, the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident) suddenly broke out. The enemy took advantage of our difficulties and intensified their aggression. The following year, the Shanghai War (January 28th Incident) also followed. At that time, there were strong enemies pressing the border, and internal disturbances from the Red bandits in Hubei and Jiangxi. The number of disasters was unprecedented since the founding of the Republic. The impact on the social economy was even greater, with all industries stagnating. In the financial sector, the first signs were unusually tight credit and a sharp drop in securities prices. For a time, all financial institutions were like isolated boats in a storm, shaking and trembling, filled with fear. Fortunately, the financial sector was able to plan ahead and began to be vigilant after the alarm from the Northeast, trying to maintain stability. Then, when the January 28th Incident was at its peak, they adopted a cooperative approach, making bills of exchange mutually transferable and usable, and making every effort to save cash payments. On the one hand, as the Spring Festival accounting period approached, they publicly discussed and postponed it. At the same time, they did not clear checks with foreign banks, and foreign banks also indicated that they would not take the opportunity to accept deposits. Therefore, the current financial situation was stabilized as a result. Subsequently, the organization of a joint bank reserve pool was restored. In the money shop sector, a special property custody committee was also established. Although all of these were temporary and hasty designs, they also showed the financial sector's painstaking efforts to cope with the environment during the national crisis.</p>
<p>Now, the four northeastern provinces have successively fallen, and the national crisis is deepening. The financial industry is in overall control of all economic activities. From the standpoint of the nation, we should consider how to jointly plan for the stability of the financial business and promote the development and consolidation of the social economy, so as to reduce the government's internal worries. During the European war, all countries had precedents that show us the way. However, judging from the past period in our country, the financial industry's contributions to society, except for a few who were sincere but constrained by circumstances and unable to express themselves and be seen by society, the rest were mediocre. We dare not offer flattering words. As far as we know, the development of the financial industry over the years has not gone beyond the following abnormal paths.</p>
<p>(1) Speculation in Government Bonds: In recent years, China's financial industry has been affected by the failure of domestic silk and tea, poor harvests, and the influx of imported agricultural products, which have eroded sales. As a result, the so-called financial season has been abnormal and chaotic since the 20th year of the Republic (1931). For example, in November of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), only 2.49 million silver dollars were exported from Shanghai. In May of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), only 1.6 million silver dollars were exported. In May of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), exports turned into imports of 9.27 million silver dollars. This is because, although China's rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, foreign goods continue to be dumped in the interior. According to a recent survey, the amount of cash concentrated in Shanghai accounts for more than one-half of the circulating funds in the country. As a result, this huge amount of cash is accumulated in urban financial institutions. With the way out blocked, they flock to the speculative operation of government bonds and treasury bills. In total, from the 16th year of the Republic (1927) to the 20th year of the Republic (1931), there were as many as 26 types of government-issued bonds and treasury bills in a five-year period, with a total issue amount of 100,120,000 yuan. In terms of each year, the number of issues in the 16th year was 76,090,074 yuan; 17th year was 10,300,000 yuan; 18th year was 24,300,000 yuan; 19th year was 17,400,000 yuan; 20th year was 41,600,000 yuan; and this spring, another patriotic treasury bill was issued, totaling 20,000,000 yuan; recently, there was another issue of 100,000,000 yuan in 22nd year Customs Treasury Bills. Although the issue amount of bonds and treasury bills is huge, the market price has risen sharply to this day, and the market still suffers from a shortage of chips. Taking the recent market price as an example, the difference between the market price before and after the January 28th Shanghai Incident is simply immeasurable. For example, on January 5th of the 21st year of the Republic (1932) before the January 28th Incident, the Shanghai bond market price index was 57.99; on January 25th, it was 51.57; and recently, on July 17th of this year, the index was 91.27. Although it can be said that there is a relationship between before and after the Shanghai War, the difference is too great. This phenomenon is most alarming in today's economic society in our country, where the rural economy is on the verge of danger, and urban industry and commerce are also dying out one after another. The path of economic development in a country always shows an average level. There is absolutely no reason for agriculture, industry, and commerce to decline, while the financial industry alone thrives.</p>
<p>(2) Enthusiasm for the Real Estate Business: In the past few years, the enthusiasm of Shanghai's financial industry for the real estate business has been an undeniable fact. According to the Puyi Company, the increase in Shanghai's real estate value in the five years from the 15th year of the Republic (1926) to the 19th year of the Republic (1930) was 200 million taels of silver. The increase in 1930 alone accounted for half of it. At the same time, the increase in dividends from Shanghai's various real estate company stocks also shows the development of the real estate business. For example, the dividend of Shanghai English-French Real Estate Company was 9 percent in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) and increased to 12 percent in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). Puyi Real Estate Company was 7 percent in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) and increased to 15 percent in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). According to the trading statistics of the Shanghai Real Estate Monthly, the total transaction amount in the 19th year of the Republic (1930) was 65 million yuan, and it increased to 131 million yuan in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). Because the silver price was low, foreign businessmen could not remit money abroad, so they invested it in real estate. In addition, in recent years, the country has been plagued by soldiers and bandits, and wars have been frequent. People in the interior cannot live in peace, and the wealthy have moved to Shanghai with their funds. As a result, the floating capital in the city has become more abundant. In addition to speculation in standard gold bonds, they have turned to real estate trading. Financial institutions have absorbed funds from other sources to invest in the real estate business. The 19th year of the Republic (1930) was the most prosperous period for Shanghai's real estate business. The degree of development was unprecedented in previous years. The increase in land prices, the addition of houses, and the large number of transactions can be described as unprecedented. Of the 200 million taels of silver increased in the total value of Shanghai real estate in the five years from the 15th year of the Republic (1926) to the 19th year of the Republic (1930) mentioned above, the increase in the 19th year alone accounted for half of it, which can be described as prosperous. However, the proper development of the real estate business must also maintain a balanced trend with the country's industry and commerce. There must be no one-sided, withered, or abnormal development.</p>
<p>In today's situation, where the rural economy is bankrupt and industry and commerce are declining, domestic funds have lost the room to stay and circulate. As a result, they all converge in the city, exhausting the country's financial resources and essence to create a floating prosperity in the big city. It is like a building whose beams and pillars have been tilted and collapsed, but still wants to decorate the exterior to create a magnificent appearance. This is really a way to self-destruction. Fortunately, after experiencing the shocks and great pain, the financial industry has realized the mistakes of the past and has expressed its determination to change and embark on the right path. This is truly where a ray of dawn comes from in our financial world. In my opinion, if the financial industry is determined to reform in the future, it should understand its own pathological state and start by consolidating its own foundation. First, the capital of banks in our country is generally from 250,000 yuan to several million yuan. The largest, the Bank of China, has more than 24.7 million yuan, and the Central Bank has 20 million yuan. With such small strength, once there is a large-scale investment project in the country, if one case is taken on exclusively, the strength will be insufficient. If one wants to unite with colleagues, they are constrained by the situation and cannot do it. As a result, foreign businessmen often preemptively seize it. Moreover, small-capital banks are already struggling to survive in normal times. If unfortunately a storm strikes, they will inevitably fail one after another. At this time, the relationship with the bank itself is still small, but the wave of repercussions, shaking the hearts of the people, will further deepen the degree of panic, and the impact on the entire social economy is significant. Therefore, the current plan should be for the government to strictly order all small banks to merge those with similar purposes or businesses, so as to concentrate their strength and establish a foundation for self-reliance. The merger of banks is a common practice in Europe, America, and Japan. Second, banks should each determine their business direction and find outlets for funds. The biggest drawback of China's financial industry at present is the competition to imitate and emulate, thereby competing for profits. In recent years, if a bank gains credit or profits by running savings or trust businesses, other banks will also set up savings and trust departments one after another. The high profits of public bonds and real estate have caused various banks to compete for investment, and the result is simply an unreasonable price increase in public bonds and real estate. All of these are the most common diseases that Chinese people are prone to incur when starting a business. In the past, the credit turmoil was also caused by this kind of mentality. Moreover, if funds are not used rationally, the bank will lose its function of regulating the social economy and facilitating national finance, and the harm will be incalculable. This is like the flow of water. If the water in the river is stagnant in one place and does not seek to discharge it, it will overflow and collapse, and it will not be considered governance. It is necessary to dredge it well so that it can flow smoothly and benefit farmland and produce. Third, from the outside, China's banks are indeed the most modern financial institutions. However, upon closer inspection of its content, either the organization is unsound, crude, and simple, or the affairs are not efficient. The authorities hope to obtain the maximum effect with the minimum remuneration for the service personnel. As a result, the service personnel are only struggling for the conditions of life, and the work is perfunctory. Everyone has the intention of leaving. This is enough to make the bank itself in a shaky situation all day long. There are also complete organizations, and the authorities are also virtuous and exemplary, but all affairs are not governed by the right people, which is also enough to hinder the future development of the bank. Fourth, special banks and industry-specific banks should be made to match their names with their realities. Among the special banks, such as the Central Bank as a national bank, the Bank of China as an international exchange bank, and the Bank of Communications as a bank for developing national industries, each has its own special tasks. Other industry-specific banks, such as industrial development, real estate, reclamation, silk, and salt, have never actually engaged in their special businesses. What they are engaged in are general commercial banking businesses, and there is absolutely no connection with the businesses they have labeled. Up to today's banks, they only know how to create new and dazzling names, but they have not made efforts to revitalize and open up new paths.</p>
<p>The above items are only personal feelings about serving in the financial sector for several years, and I would like to discuss them with interested people.</p>
<h3>The Future of Trust Business in China</h3>
<p>By Zhu Si-huang</p>
<p>The trust business in China originated in the tenth year of the Republic (1921). In recent years, it has become increasingly developed, but compared with Europe and the United States, it still feels far behind. The most common trust businesses in China are trust investment, real estate agency matters, securities agency matters, warehousing and stacking, guidance, etc. As for the execution of will trusts, management of inheritance trusts, guardianship trusts, living trusts, issuance of corporate bond trusts, etc., there have also been instances, but they are still being promoted. However, the general trust companies also handle banking and insurance businesses. On the contrary, the development of the banking industry is far more advanced than the trust business itself. The trust department in the bank is mainly the banking industry, so it goes without saying. So, what is the reason why the trust business in China cannot be as developed as in Europe and the United States? The biggest reason is the difference in social and economic conditions between China and foreign countries. It is undeniable that China's industry and commerce are backward and its economy is immature. The scarcity of trust events is also expected. Moreover, the administration of property and the execution of wills are often hindered by the fact that the Chinese people like to keep secrets, and the disposal of inheritance does not have the various legal procedures of European and American countries. As for group trusts, company organizations have not yet developed, and stock circulation is rare. Corporate bonds are even rarer in the market. In foreign countries, industry and commerce are developed on a large scale, and raising capital by issuing shares is far-reaching. The buying and selling of transfers is even more cumbersome. Initially, trust companies are responsible for raising capital by issuing shares, and then they take on the labor of transfer and registration. Eventually, when it comes to raising debts, it is often millions or tens of millions, which cannot be lent by one or two banks. Then, the trust company sells it to the market in the form of public bonds, just like the government's issuance of public bonds. When the bond tickets have been distributed to the market, the bondholders cannot manage the collateral property of the bond tickets, and the trust company rises up to take on the work. This is the origin of the group trust business of trust companies handling company establishment, acting as agent for stock transfer and registration, handling the issuance of corporate bonds, and acting as agents for all company financial matters. If we talk about China, industry and commerce are still in their infancy, small-scale operations, and partnership organizations are more common. Raising capital and funds is mostly limited to relatives and friends. Occasionally, there are company stocks, buying and selling transfers, the transaction is not complicated, and the amount of debt raised on weekdays is also small, so it is not difficult for banks to cope alone. Or there are debts that are relatively large, up to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands. If one bank cannot cope, they contact other banks to jointly lend money. This is what the world calls transfer of loan funds, but after all, it is not as huge as foreign corporate bonds, and it is not convenient to raise funds in the form of public bonds. Moreover, Chinese shops like to keep secrets when they raise shares and debts, and they are deeply worried that outsiders will hear about it, which will damage their reputation. How can they be as willing as foreigners to rely on others to openly solicit funds. Therefore, this kind of group trust affairs also has no chance to revive. Furthermore, in terms of trust investment, the key to investment is to have three principles: (1) stable principal; (2) abundant profit; (3) convenient trading. Only those that meet these can be regarded as the most noble investment. Among the most</p>
<p>common investment products in China, such as public bonds, the profit is indeed abundant due to the discount relationship. The exchange specializes in public bonds, and the buying and selling are also convenient, but the price is high or low, and it changes with the times. At this time of internal and external troubles, in the autumn of wind and rain, the bond market is uncertain, which can be imagined. As a result, the most important first principle is difficult to meet, so how can it be regarded as the best investment. As for real estate, in European and American countries, it has always been a tool for investment. In its country, industry and commerce are advancing, the population is numerous, the land price is rising, and the economic development makes it so. There is absolutely no worry about a sudden rise or fall, so the principal is very stable. Moreover, the market interest rate is low at about 2 or 3 percent, while the income from real estate is always between 5 and 6 percent, so the world uses borrowing to operate real estate, and there is surplus after paying back the principal and interest, so the profit is not abundant. As a result, there are many operators. The real estate situation in our country is also developed on the surface. In fact, has the increase in Shanghai's land price in recent years been based on economic development? Generally speaking, the interior is in turmoil, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the number of people coming to Shanghai to seek refuge and those entering the city to make a living is increasing day by day. The floating capital in the interior is also concentrated in the city. For a time, the population increased, and the floating capital lacked a proper use. Therefore, it is either public bonds or real estate. In this way, the land price rises day by day. However, the urban economy and the rural economy are mutually dependent. If the rural areas are like this, it will be difficult to maintain their abnormal development for a long time. Since the September 18th Incident, the price of public bonds has plummeted. After the January 28th Shanghai War, the real estate market was very different from the past. Since the consolidation of domestic debt, the bond market has gradually turned around, and the stagnation of the real estate industry is the same as before. Other industries, Ning Yihai city issued a building, this is considered or there is over, but not entirely without truth. In addition, the market interest rate is more than one point higher, and the average is often around 7 percent. The income from real estate is only between 5 and 6 percent. If real estate is a true investment, it is even more difficult to obtain abundant profits. As a result, speculative buying and selling are rampant. There is no lack of people who start a family with this, but unfortunately, it is not uncommon to see people who are ruined and die as a result. In short, what China lacks is a true investment in agriculture, industry, and commerce. Why should we regard speculative buying and selling of public bonds and real estate as a way to maintain a livelihood? How can it be regarded as a proper investment? Since there is a lack of tools for proper investment, the development of trust investment will naturally be difficult. On the one hand, it is due to the compulsion of the environment, and there is no way to do it. On the other hand, there are few influential promoters among the leaders of the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors. Although one or two sound banks and trust companies handle trust investment with great care, if the social economy continues in this way, it will not only be difficult to revitalize the trust business, but it will also be a concern for the entire national financial industry and for the future of the national economy.</p>
<p>For the sake of expanding the trust business today, we can only guide the society on the one hand to make them understand the true meaning of trust, and on the other hand, establish new methods and open up another way for the financial world. It is absolutely impossible to follow the crowd and make mistakes by following the old ways. When a manufacturer creates new products, he must first start with advertising and publicity to make people develop a habit of buying and using new products. Only then can new products be sold well. At present, the trust business in our country is in its infancy, which is no different from newly created items. Although it is not necessarily a publicity-style promotion, it is important to clarify the true meaning of trust, so that people know what a trust is and develop the habit of trusting. Foreign banks often issue books and distribute them to all sectors of society. The content is dedicated to current affairs or a certain economic issue. The only note in the whole book is that a certain bank published it. There is absolutely no word to boast about itself. The purpose of giving away books is to connect feelings and to explain problems. The works are broadcast, and they are very effective invisibly. Such non-advertising-style publicity has lofty goals and is truly superior. In addition to publicity, we must also open up new paths in business, so as to lay the foundation for expanding business and strengthen the society's sincere faith. According to the difficulties of trust companies in our country in handling company establishment, acting as agent for stock transfer and registration, handling the issuance of corporate bonds, and acting as agents for all company financial matters, as well as handling trust investment, it has been described above. Now, if we want to overcome the difficulties, we can only help to promote the proper investment of industrial and commercial industries, so that the progress of the trust business can benefit each other. There are many ways to do this, and promoting the acceptance of company stocks and bonds is the most effective way. That is, if a new company wants to issue stocks and bonds, the trust company will purchase a certain amount and then sell it on the market. If all of them can be sold, the trust company will not keep them for itself. Otherwise, the trust company will keep some for itself. If the price at which the trust company pre-purchased is lower than the price at which it distributes, then the trust company can make a profit, otherwise it will lose money. Therefore, if the trust company wants to do this kind of business, it must first estimate the sales of the stocks and bonds in the future. If it wants to increase sales, it has to have a mechanism for buying and selling and promotion. Our country's public bonds and treasury bills have exchanges as a mechanism for buying and selling, and the transaction of company stocks and bonds is insignificant at the exchange. On the contrary, the stocks and bonds of foreign companies in China have the General Assembly Hall operated by foreign merchants, and the transactions are frequent. Therefore, our country still lacks a real securities market, which is the center for trading various company stocks and bonds. This depends entirely on the financial industry leaders calling out and vigorously promoting it. In recent years, there have been several large banks that have promoted the commercial bill market. The securities market is also seen as equally important. The former regulates the flow of capital, so it is also called the financial market. The latter regulates fixed capital, so it is also called the capital market. Since there is a market, promotion will be easy, and the stocks and bonds issued are carefully considered by the trust company and accepted, so they must be top-notch. Once they are accepted first, and given the credit of a well-known trust company, the reputation will increase a hundredfold, and promotion will be even easier. With the help of trust companies, industry and commerce can prosper and grow, and good stocks and bonds will naturally increase. Therefore, the acceptance business of trust companies will be developed more and more, and social funds will also flow into proper investment. The trust company is needed everywhere for buying and selling transfers. Therefore, the trust company only promotes the securities market and the acceptance business, which has done its best to handle company establishment and issue corporate bond trusts, and can also expand other trust businesses, such as acting as agent for stock transfer and registration, acting as agent for all company financial matters, and trust investment, which is truly killing many birds with one stone. However, this is just one example. There are still thousands of things that trust industry leaders should encourage and promote and cooperate with other groups. Everything must be seen with a long-term perspective, and we must not haggle over the current interests. If we proceed step by step, constantly strive for self-improvement, and can further improve internal affairs and stabilize the situation, then the future of trust will have no end!</p>
<h3>Research on the Establishment of Local Branch Banks</h3>
<p>Initial Draft</p>
<p>Recently, the banking sector in Shanghai has been enthusiastically establishing branch banks in the local area. Branches of various banks have been set up in places like Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Ba Xian Qiao, North Sichuan Road, and the South City. I have carefully examined the reasons for establishing these branches, which mainly fall into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Absorption of Deposits: Deposits are the lifeline of a bank. Therefore, absorbing deposits is the only way to sustain a bank's life. Having a large amount of deposits allows for easy financial maneuvering in the financial society, providing access to resources from all directions. This eliminates the risk of being caught short and revealing a state of financial distress. According to the business reports of various banks for the year 1931, the deposits of banks such as the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and the Shanghai Bank are relatively high, and these banks also have more local branch banks than other banks. (2) Promotion of Savings Business: The nature of savings deposits is different from other commercial transaction deposits. The adjustment of store finances must go through the hands of banks (or other financial institutions) to facilitate their turnover to be effective. In this case, stores rely on banks. The nature of savings deposits is not like this; customers have no commercial interest with the bank and they may choose to save or not save without much consequence. The customer's decision to deposit is half dependent on the convenience of the bank's service. Therefore, banks operating in the savings business tend to accommodate customers by raising the interest rate on deposits and solidifying their security to attract customers. Most savings customers are scattered small accounts, spread throughout the region. One branch is not enough to cover everything, so the various local branch banks set up and strive to promote within their respective areas, absorbing deposits, gathering small amounts to form large amounts, and accumulating sand to form a tower. The promotion of savings business depends on the establishment of local branch banks. Looking at the savings deposits of various banks in 1931, apart from the Four Banks Savings Association, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has the most, and that bank has six local branch banks established.</p>
<p>(3) Competition Among Peers: Competition among peers has become a customary practice, even among enlightened bankers today. If one bank establishes a branch in a certain area, others will follow suit. Before long, there will be many branch banks striving to compete; this is one of the reasons why there are so many local branch banks in Shanghai, creating several concentrated areas of banks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the sole purpose of establishing local branch banks is to promote the bank's own business, absorb deposits, serve society, and adjust the local financial situation. The intention is good. However, given the current state of commerce in Shanghai, the market is bleak and the situation is dire, so many banks are unnecessary. Counting the total number of branches and sub-branches in the British and French Concessions and the North and South Cities, the number is about one hundred. The head office and head management office are responsible for directing the branches throughout the country, so we can ignore this. However, the branch banks in the area are all short of customers and have little to do. The establishment of a branch bank, from the manager to the staff, requires at least five to seven people. The expenses for rent, salaries, and other costs are no less than several thousand gold per month. The only business they conduct is absorbing deposits, but the operation of lending money must follow the orders of the head office and cannot be done freely. The interest on deposits is paid, and expenses are wasted, so the income cannot make up for the losses. Even in terms of the business of absorbing deposits, there are also many incomprehensible aspects. At this time, the economy is declining, commerce is stagnant, and rural finance is extremely depleted. However, urban finance is expanding, and funds from various places are gathering in Shanghai, gradually flowing into the bank's vaults, and the bank's funds are said to be increasing month by month. At the same time, the economic slump in the countryside has never been worse than it is today. Calls for relief have long been heard throughout the government and the public. Banks have a responsibility to adjust finances and cannot shirk their duty to provide relief. However, apart from the Bank of China establishing a branch in Ding County, there are few examples of this being put into practice. However, the establishment of local branch banks does little to adjust the local financial situation and contributes little to the bank itself. Therefore, why not transfer the expenses of establishing local branch banks to establishing rural branch banks, so that rural finance can be adjusted, and the bank itself can also start a new business and find an outlet for the use of deposits? This is truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>On Shanghai Banks Launching</p>
<h3>Several Contributions of Rural Marketing Cooperatives</h3>
<p>Gao, Jin, Xi</p>
<p>Since the advent of railways, land transportation, and global trade, the self-sufficient state of China for thousands of years has undergone a great change. Today, farmers can no longer rely solely on their land as a means of survival, but also depend on changes in market conditions to determine whether their lives are stable. If farmers are ignorant of market conditions, and encounter oversupply and sluggish sales of agricultural products, then the results of the farmers' year-long toil and labor will not be rewarded; they may even sacrifice the funds they invested in production. Furthermore, the exploitation of intermediaries will only make their losses worse. The fact that cheap grain hurts farmers in the past is a clear example. To this day, farmers' wounds are deep, and the vitality of rural areas is difficult to restore, which is enough to be a good lesson for us.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank, in view of this situation, in order to alleviate the suffering of farmers and stabilize the rural economy, has plans to establish rural marketing cooperatives. (October 2, this newspaper, East China News). It is still in the initial trial stage, and will be formally implemented after the shareholders' meeting next year. Its benefits to our farmers are great. This is what our farmers have been praying for day and night.</p>
<p>The significance of rural transportation cooperatives lies in seeking the organized marketing of agricultural products based on the principle of not seeking profit, so that individual farmers can generally benefit. In terms of concrete effects, the first is that it can improve the producer's pricing position, the second is that it can ensure that most of the money spent by consumers goes into the hands of producers, and the third is that it can guarantee continuous supply and regular trade. All three of these can reduce farmers' wastage and increase farmers' wealth. Everyone involved in cooperation knows this. Now, the Shanghai Bank is launching rural marketing cooperatives. Can it truly enable our farmers to work the land with peace of mind, and entrust the full authority of trade to the cooperative? Can it truly increase farmers' wealth to stabilize our rural economy? Can it truly reduce all or most of the floating losses to improve the current distribution system? I will see it here.</p>
<p>However, there are many failures of transportation cooperatives in the world. The operation of transportation cooperatives has its own practical difficulties. Even if the theory of transportation cooperation is absolutely sound, it cannot make up for the many difficulties in practice. Now, I would like to raise a few points for discussion and resolution with the Shanghai Bank, and also to tell comrades who are interested in marketing cooperation. I sincerely hope that everyone will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>(1) Do those who run rural marketing cooperatives have commercial experience? To develop the transportation cooperation business, the people who run the cooperative must have sufficient commercial experience, and they must have a thorough understanding of the rise and fall of market prices and the needs of various places. Is the selection of the manager of the Shanghai Bank Transportation Cooperative arbitrarily selected by someone in the bank? Is the commercial experience sufficient? Is the vision broad? Can they have a slight grasp of the rise and fall of market prices in advance? Are they familiar with commercial geography? Can they roughly understand the needs of any agricultural products in various places and have the ability to expand them? All of these should be examined when selecting personnel. Moreover, the purpose of the cooperative is to replace the functions of brokers and eliminate brokers' profits, which will inevitably arouse the jealousy and competition of brokers. Can the manager of the cooperative develop the transportation business to a sufficiently reliable extent to generate sales agencies and expand operations? Only those with rich commercial experience can be competent and happy in their work. This is the first point that the Shanghai Bank should pay attention to when selecting the manager of the cooperative.</p>
<p>(2) Are the members loyal? The loyalty of the members is also the key to the success or failure of transportation cooperatives. Marketing cooperatives are constantly struggling with brokers. If the members are not loyal and cannot have a common belief and determination to sacrifice for the cooperative, they will easily be tempted by the brokers' high prices and sell independently, which will result in the entire cooperative suffering and even disbanding. This is a common occurrence. Furthermore, Chinese farmers have short-sighted views and lack a spirit of teamwork. They are easily manipulated by brokers' provocations and take independent action to obtain better prices and privately deal with brokers. If one member withdraws from the cooperative, the trading volume per unit will decrease. If two members withdraw from the cooperative, the trading volume per unit will decrease even further. This is a very serious blow to the transportation cooperative business. What methods will the Shanghai Bank use to gain the trust of its members? What precise and strict methods will it use to train the members' actions? This is the second point to pay attention to.</p>
<p>(3) Does transportation cooperation have a central business? Does the Shanghai Bank Transportation Cooperative have a central business as the goal of its activities? If it can be based on one type of agricultural product, then the procedures for collecting agricultural products in the local transportation center, setting standards, grading, packaging, transportation and delivery, hoarding and manufacturing, management, and accounting can all be handled uniformly, which is simpler and easier. The agricultural products in China that can be the central business of transportation and sales include cotton, tea, and silk. If the central business is a special agricultural product in a certain place, it is necessary to consider how to save complicated procedures to be more in line with the principles of economic efficiency. This is the third point to pay attention to.</p>
<p>The above three points are just some of the more important ones. I would like to offer my humble opinion to the Shanghai Bank, with no intention of criticism. I have high expectations for the Shanghai Bank and also high hopes for the transportation cooperation business. I sincerely hope that the Shanghai Bank's operation of this business will be very successful, and that it will inspire other financial institutions to follow suit. Therefore, I would like to present the difficulties I have considered from my own limited perspective as a reference for implementation.</p>

<h3>Last Week's Government Bonds Rose Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>|Still a Risk of a Short Squeeze|</p>
<p>From October 2nd to 7th last week, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw a significant rebound in the market. The political turmoil of the previous week has passed. It is rumored that Wang and Huang will return to Beijing or go north, which has stabilized public sentiment. Although the new government bonds have been issued, the amount is actually 100 million, instead of the rumored 50 million. However, they will not be circulated in the market for the time being, and will not conflict with the existing bonds on the market. Therefore, there were more short covering transactions on the market, which led to a rebound in prices. Based on this observation of the future, if there are no special changes in the political situation, there may still be a larger short squeeze. On Monday, because Wang returned to Beijing and Huang went north, the political situation was stable, and the financial situation had improved. Numbers 50 and 47 were bought, and the market price rose by 60-70 jiao. On Tuesday, the market was slightly chaotic due to rumors that 50 million new government bonds would be issued, and public sentiment was somewhat uncertain. The market price fluctuated slightly. The market was closed on Wednesday for the Mid-Autumn Festival. On Thursday, the actual amount of new government bonds issued was 100 million, and Minister Song explained that they would be used to repay old debts to banks and would not be circulated in the market. This increased the financial industry's income, and the market did not feel the harm of an oversupply of cash. Financial institutions such as numbers 38 and 47 were buying, and number 31 heavily covered their short positions. The market price rose by 50-60 jiao, which was beyond the expectations of most short sellers. On Friday, both sides exchanged their positions, and trading became quieter. The market was stable. On Saturday morning, the market was extremely sluggish, but in the afternoon, the market rebounded due to buying and short covering. Therefore, it rose by 30-40 jiao. Overall, the market price rose by several jiao to about 1.23 yuan last week. The total transaction volume was 37,961,500 yuan, including 31,500 yuan in cash, 15,225,000 yuan in salt tax futures, 5,440,000 yuan in disarmament bonds, 3,420,000 yuan in the 1929 customs bonds, 8,070,000 yuan in the 1931 20/20 customs bonds, 2,970,000 yuan in the reorganization bonds, 1,770,000 yuan in the 96 bonds, and less than 500,000 yuan in gold shorts.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Bullish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially firm and active due to positive political news for the bulls, but then weakened due to southern hedging. As a result, spot prices were unchanged, while futures prices rose by 1 to 5 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 6 points and futures prices rose by 7-8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 3 points. Indian cotton rose due to short covering and speculative buying. As a result, Pingar rose by 1.5 rupees, Omra rose by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas, and Baraoxi rose by 7.5 annas. Original telegram from (7th).</p>

<h3>We Need Experienced and Interested Teachers</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>After a busy day of work, the burden seems to lighten considerably by evening, but the whole body is already exhausted. However, driven by the desire for knowledge, I disregard everything and use the last of my energy to satisfy my desires. So, every day after 7 pm, I give up rest and all other trivial tasks, and drag this tired body into what I think is a satisfactory XX Cram School for Evening Studies.</p>
<p>In the past, I felt that rote learning was rigid and boring, and I wanted to adjust this boring life, so I resolutely left school and embarked on the journey of society; preparing to take society as my school and nature as my teacher, seeking some practical and applicable activities. However, in our chaotic and contradictory society, this is too ideal. In fact, it tells me that I have to go to evening school.</p>
<p>XX Cram School for Evening Studies, on the first day of school, I listened with full enthusiasm to the speech of our vice-principal... "In this cram school for evening studies, I know that every student's motivation for learning is active rather than passive. They must earn their own tuition fees. So, we are running this cram school for evening studies purely for the sake of young people who have dropped out of school but are eager to learn. We don't have any profit-making motives. At present, due to financial and material limitations, the scale is inevitably simple, but we will try to expand it in the future to achieve perfection..." These words are still clearly flashing in my mind. But, a semester, now it is almost over, what have I gained? This calls on me to discuss the issue of teachers with our night school and request an effective correction and reform!</p>
<p>The first thing we should know... a teacher is not able to teach simply because they have high or considerable knowledge. Because "knowledge" and "teaching" are fundamentally two different things. For example, can a teacher with profound knowledge but no energy, teaching experience, or interest pour their profound knowledge into the students' stomachs like water? So, people without experience and interest who come to teach are, bluntly speaking, not "teaching" but simply "making a living"! We are unwilling and unfit to call someone who merely stands on the podium, gesticulates, shouts, and babbles for the sake of "making a living" a "teacher." If it is said that "teaching" for "making a living" is acceptable, then who doesn't need to eat? Can any Tom, Dick, or Harry run to the podium and "teach"?</p>
<p>However, in our night school, what kind of teachers do we have? In fact, no one can deny that recently my classroom has been filled with a dead atmosphere; the eyes of all the students - in fact, there are only a few scattered ones! - have been covered with a layer of dim shadows, and so-called "interest" has been chased away to the ends of the earth by everyone who is disappointed and frustrated! Please tell me, no matter what you do, if you lose "interest" and force yourself to do it, will there still be any vitality? I believe that our students are not without places to relax, without places to chat, or even without places to be after finishing their work. We take time out of our busy schedules to "cram," which is naturally not accidental! In short, our teacher, at least I can say with certainty, is someone who has no teaching experience and interest!</p>
<p>Finally, I have two sentences to say to our night school and all other cram schools... if it is really "purely for the sake of young people who have dropped out of school but are eager to learn" (the words of our vice-principal), we need energetic, experienced, and interested teachers!</p>
<h3>Sunday</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Weeks and weeks pass by, so quickly, how can one not be frightened? Sunday is the last day of the week.</p>
<p>The general people of the church have made this annotation to "Sunday": "God created all things in heaven and earth in six days, and rested on the seventh day, called the Sabbath." Those who believe in Christianity are of course the faithful followers of God and Jesus, so every Sunday, they sincerely carry the Bible to church to worship.</p>
<p>This is similar to "knowing is difficult, doing is easy." People know how to use Sunday, but many people are blind, that is, they know that they should rest one day after working hard for six days. But how many people are really resting peacefully on this day?</p>
<p>Most schools have a full day and a half of vacation (church schools abandon the entire Sunday morning to worship, and recently, most schools have abandoned the two hours of weekly meetings on Saturday afternoons). Our farmers, the farmers in rural areas whose lives are already on the verge of bankruptcy, where are their Sundays, their vacations? Our sacred workers, the working masses who work twelve hours a day, where are their Sundays? Even if they have them, they are replaced by living expenses. Merchants probably don't care about resting or not, but of course, there are some exceptions. Ah! Everyone needs rest. Who should not rest? The streets are always crowded with people. Unsurprisingly, the number of pedestrians increases invisibly on Sundays. This is entirely a reflection of Sunday! Ah! They have the space and money to buy things...</p>
<p>Movie theaters change their films on Sundays, welcoming people who are resting. On this day, we can often see the sign "House Full" hanging above the door. There are also XX dog racing tracks, XX horse racing, and ______... disguised gambling. Accommodating a large number of people who are resting. XX dance halls, XX theaters, XX Worlds... are also crowded with people.</p>
<p>Ah! Let's look at another corner of society! A large number of people are experiencing a bread panic? ....................Ah! Society is so contradictory, and all of this is fully expressed on Sundays!</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhu Often Eats Rice Bran</h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>At ordinary banquets, there is the entertainment of finger-guessing games and drinking orders. Although it is a common custom, it is not unrefined, and it adds to the liveliness and raises a lot of interest...</p>
<p>During the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, shops all prepare festive banquets for guests as usual. That day, I was invited by my old friend Mr. Chen of a certain company to attend a banquet, as was proper. Upon arrival, I found many distinguished guests and friends gathered. The banquet, capable of seating several people, was arranged in an orderly fashion. After taking our seats, we began toasting and drinking. For a time, the wine flowed like raindrops. Some drank and ate heartily, causing great disorder. Most of us in the business world adhere to the "one incense stick" principle, determined not to stop eating until the bottom of the bowl is facing the sky, which is completely different from the refined eating habits of schoolteachers... After drinking until halfway through the banquet, the faces of everyone turned red. Then, they were filled with enthusiasm and decided to play drinking games. Although this was a business gathering, there was also a friend who worked in a government agency. That friend came up with a drinking game: everyone had to write a three-character phrase that was related to their profession. If someone failed to provide an answer, they would be penalized with ten cups of wine. After the game was announced, there were five people in the group, including myself. Besides the friend in government, there was also a rice store owner, a Mr. Zhu, whose business was unclear, so everyone called him Mr. Zhu, and an apprentice from the store, who was only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was very eloquent and a good student who could answer fluently. When it came to me, who was in the silk business, I could be considered someone who made a living from silk. After a brief introduction of the five gentlemen (excluding myself), here's the main event!</p>
<p>The first to go was the friend in government, the initiator of the game. He wrote the three characters 官宦家 (guānhuàn jiā), meaning "official's family" (three "hat" radicals). He considered himself an official's family, a very loyal comrade. The second to go was me. I picked up the brush and wrote 綢緞縐 (chóuduàn zhòu), meaning "silk crepe" (three "silk" radicals). The third to go was Mr. Zhu. After thinking for a while, he frowned and came up with an idea. He wrote 朱先生 (Zhū xiānsheng), meaning "Mr. Zhu" (three "cow" radicals). The fourth to go was the rice store owner. Naturally, it was very easy for him. Without rushing, he wrote 米糟糠 (mǐ zāo kāng), meaning "rice dregs and bran" (three "rice" radicals). These three characters seemed to have the same ingenuity as my silk crepe. Finally, it was the apprentice's turn. Without hesitation, he wrote two lines in the style of a couplet: 官宦家穿着綢緞縐，朱先生常吃米糟糠 (Guānhuàn jiā chuānzhuó chóuduàn zhòu, Zhū xiānsheng cháng chī mǐ zāo kāng), meaning "Officials wear silk crepe, Mr. Zhu often eats rice dregs and bran." Although the words were playful, the sentence structure was very well-formed. Coming from the mouth of a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old apprentice, it was truly commendable. When everyone saw this couplet, they burst into laughter. Only Mr. Zhu was very displeased, constantly complaining about bad luck.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Jottings</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Across from the dormitory of XX University is a row of neat Western-style houses, separated by a low fence and a wide alley. From the dormitory upstairs, everything in the alley can be seen without missing a thing. Living in that alley are foreigners, Chinese, and even more so, Chinese girls in the prime of their youth!</p>
<p>Ordinary unmarried college students, staying in this lonely building, originally felt that life was too monotonous and wanted to find something to nourish and regulate their lives. Now, this came at just the right time. So, whenever they had free time from classes, they would lie by the window, looking at the opposite side for amusement.</p>
<p>The girls in the alley were not without intentions either. Two of them, dressed beautifully and charmingly, would often intentionally or unintentionally cast their eyes sideways. At this moment, the hearts of lustful young men were as if grabbed by them. Hungry and greedy eyes stared at them, from top to bottom, admiring and begging for pity.</p>
<p>"Hey, let's go see a movie at the Great Light today? Let's go, let's go," someone shouted.</p>
<p>The other party didn't respond, which was really infuriating. Scold them, they only deserve to be scolded, unappreciative things.</p>
<p>"Damn, acting like it's a big deal, huh!" The voice was quite loud.</p>
<p>Finally, she turned her head, and her beautiful eyes flashed like a shooting star. Ah, satisfying, interesting.</p>
<p>"[A turn of the head] brings forth a hundred charms, making the beauty of the alley fade in comparison." Haha! Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>The university students were criticizing and commenting... who had the prettiest face, whose breasts protruded the most, whose buttocks were the biggest. As they talked, they laughed again, their laughter almost shaking the house.</p>
<p>"Lao Jin, that girl wearing the green cheongsam has feelings for you!"</p>
<p>Lao Jin quickly declined, "Nonsense, nonsense, Lao Zhang has a chance."</p>
<p>"Ha, yesterday I walked out of the school gate and ran into that curly-haired guy. When she saw me wearing glasses, she called me 'four-eyed dog' [with a nanny's accent], little bitch!" Fatty Lao Wu said, pretending to be very angry on the surface.</p>
<p>"Honored, honored," everyone praised him.</p>
<p>In the evening, in the faint light of the street lamps, these two girls appeared again.</p>
<p>"Amao, shall we go to the Great Road or the Fourth Road?" One of them asked in a sharp voice.</p>
<p>"Whatever, you decide!" The other replied.</p>
<p>"Wait, I'm going too!" A chorus of joyful voices came from the dormitory.</p>
<p>"Dong, dong, dong, dong!" A rush of footsteps down the stairs, a group of people chasing after them.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (44) (A Four-Act Play)</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Act Three: Ode to Peace</p>
<p>Financial Tycoon: Oh... if both of you say so, then you are really making fun of us. Frankly speaking, who is happy to issue war bonds these days? But there is no other way. In any case, we must look at the situation with a broader perspective. If the war doesn't stop, the market will not be calm, and not only will finance stagnate and exchange rates be weak, but business cannot be done, and factories will have to close down. These are all obvious facts. Moreover, the Red Bandit uprising in Jiangxi is actually a hidden danger for us. If we can't get rid of them, then our interests will inevitably be fundamentally shaken. So, in this respect, we absolutely should support a ceasefire, so as not to hinder the military forces suppressing the bandits. This is our most important consideration. Now that a ceasefire has created financial problems, even though it is obviously a way to extort us, under these major premises, we must still endure it like [a mute eating Coptis chinensis (bitter herbs)]. What other way is there than to say [the bitterness is in my heart]?</p>
<p>Entrepreneur: Anyone can say these words, but we have to be able to come up with the money.</p>
<p>Financial Tycoon: Since you say so, then fine, we will take the last resort: we will block financing and cut off ties with you entrepreneurs, let's see if your stock prices will fall.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur: Fine, let's all perish together, everyone close their factories, let's see where you financiers will go to recover your debts?</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce President: Come on, come on, we are all interdependent. No matter what, let's talk about it when we close shop. Our merchants will contribute five million. Anyway, after the ceasefire, Japanese goods will always sell without hindrance. Mr. Liu will contribute six million, and the remaining nine million will be acknowledged by the banking community. The situation is already so serious, if you don't agree, don't even think about leaving here with your head on your shoulders. Which is more important, money or your life? ... But here I have learned a lot more about the ways of the world; it goes without saying that we don't have our own government, and even Director Tian, whom we usually trust so much, is not one of us, but has joined forces with them.</p>
<p>Financial Tycoon: You are wronging him, under this high-pressure policy, what can he do? We are being held here under house arrest, isn't he also being held upstairs? (Seeing the Confidential Secretary coming out from behind the velvet curtain). Secretary He, please ask the Minister and others to come down, we have a solution now. (Confidential Secretary goes upstairs).</p>
<p>Entrepreneur: Alas! God only knows! (Silence for a while).</p>
<p>Military Authority: (Accompanied by Political Authority, Peace Negotiator, Secretary descending the stairs) Oh! Everyone, you've worked hard (shakes hands with the three one by one). Secretary He, tell them to lift the state of alert. (Secretary goes down) Everyone, please sit down, today... I haven't asked for your consent yet, I would like to appoint Mr. Yu as the representative. Is that okay?</p>
<p>Political Authority: (Pauses for a moment) Good, good, I always agree with the Minister's opinions.</p>
<p>Financial Tycoon: May I ask, Minister, can the contents of the ceasefire terms be announced?</p>
<p>Military Authority: Of course, but it must be absolutely secret. It's like this... The Japanese side will help our country suppress the bandits, our side will ban the boycott movement against Japanese goods, and at the same time recognize the puppet state of Manchuria, and in the current war zone, China shall never station troops.</p>
<p>Everyone in unison: Oh... (Secretary enters).</p>
<p>Military Authority: But what will be announced to the outside world is... No need to say, it will be visible in the newspapers in a day or two. Alright, bring a bottle of champagne. ... Everyone has worked too hard, please sit down. (Orderly brings champagne up). Come, let's have a glass of champagne to celebrate the peace of China...</p>
<p>Everyone in unison: Long live Chinese peace!</p>
<p>Military Authority: Long live Sino-Japanese friendship!</p>

<h3>New Trends in British Films</h3>
<p>— Huang Junru</p>
<p>Declining Along with the Decline of Capitalism</p>
<p>Generally speaking, British films are lagging behind. This is not only because they cannot compete with American films in the Chinese market, but also because they are not welcomed by audiences in Europe. In the past two years, they have tried hard to improve, to enrich the quality, to inject a large amount of entertainment blood to cater to the audience's psychology, and to form joint productions and alliances with Germany to increase their strength in order to resist the United States... but everywhere they are still unable to match the power of American films. Therefore, even what the world recognizes and what they pride themselves on, "British films are characterized by ample entertainment," has been doubted, and they have had to change the content. But this transformation movement is not towards a better direction, but rather follows the increasingly declining path of American films. This can be seen from the opinion of the chairman of Sound City Ltd. regarding the future of British film companies. He said...</p>
<p>"We must know that film is an agile and active mechanism, and has become a work of art of the present era. In the past, all British films only interested audiences, but were of no benefit. Because what was shown were hazy and flimsy stage plays. Now, Hollywood's productions have been transported to the mainland, and even sell well throughout the world. The reason why their films are welcomed by audiences is because their films have greatly changed their past mistakes, from feudal-style dramas to modern art-style dramas, from hazy silent films to bright sound films, using the powerful thinking of the present era to instruct the masses, with the lives of the masses as the background. These are all reasons why they have gained an important artistic position. I hope that British films in the future must follow in the footsteps of American films, using films as a propaganda tool for the people, presenting artful dramas to the masses, and offering powerful ideas to the audience. Now I am satisfied to see that my company's production Reunion is fully equipped with all of the above points, and completely abandons hazy feudal-style thinking. This makes me feel that the future of British films is very promising, and very gratifying! Actors! Quickly muster your patience and awaken the masses with valuable performances!"</p>
<p>Of course, the above words are not the opinion of the entire British film industry... but from this we can also see a glimpse of the direction of British films. In short, films dominated by capitalism, no matter how they change in the future, will only decline more and more along with the decline of capitalism.</p>
<h3>Review of "Spring Silkworms"</h3>
<p>— Co-reviewed by He Lian, Gaoyuan, Lu Jia, Ling He, Gao Mo’er</p>
<p>(1) On the Adaptation of Literary Works into Films</p>
<p>As the “First Shot of Educational Films” and the “Pioneer of Film Production,” the Star Company's sound film "Spring Silkworms" premiered at the New Light Theater. Although several theaters were showing new films on the same day, "Spring Silkworms" was sold out. The first collaboration between the new literary world and cinema has, in fact, answered those who maliciously try to undermine the alliance between the new literary world and film!</p>
<p>Because I am tasked with discussing the adaptation of literary works into film, and because the word count must be limited to around 500, I can only speak roughly below.</p>
<p>Adapting famous novels into films did not begin with "Spring Silkworms." We can find precedents everywhere. However, there are several difficulties in adapting novels into films.</p>
<p>First, as Pudovkin said, "a story is too long to fit on film" (from "Film Directing").</p>
<p>Second, the methods of expression in literature and film are different. Therefore, to adapt a novel into a film, it must undergo thorough adaptation. Obvious examples include "The Iron Flood," which is different from "And Quiet Flows the Don," and "All Quiet on the Western Front," which is different from Remarque's original work. Furthermore, in literature, no matter what, "image-based expression" is required. However, some parts can still be expressed through lectures or spoken through characters. In contrast, film completely requires action and movement for expression. Even some Soviet directors who advocate "using literary methods" for "inner characterization" still express this "inner characterization" through actions!</p>
<p>Legendary stories and heroic characters interest the masses. As for literary works (like those of the liberal school), they tend to write about ordinary stories and ordinary characters. While film also emphasizes realism, it also needs climaxes!</p>
<p>For the above reasons, adapting literary works into films is quite difficult, but not absolutely impossible. It requires skillful adaptation! (Mo'er)</p>
<p>(2) From Novel to Film</p>
<p>Of course, we do not doubt the possibility of bringing sketch-like novels to the screen, provided that the writer can grasp the central material of a novel, strengthen the dramatic elements, and not become a prisoner of the novel. However, here I believe that Mr. Cai Shusheng was too faithful to the novel, and Mr. Cheng Bugao was also too faithful to the script, so that our "Spring Silkworms" is still mainly a novel, still a series of illustrations, and not a brand-new film.</p>
<p>First, the whole film lacks a climax; it just unfolds evenly. Therefore, the audience pays equal attention to the entire film without particularly noticing any part of it. As a result, the audience only has a superficial impression and no strong memory.</p>
<p>Second, the mode of expression is insufficient. For example, when Duoduo Tou throws garlic into the river, it may be enough to express Duoduo Tou's resentment in literature, but the film does not give the audience a clear and tense suggestive effect. To deepen the audience's impression, exaggeration is necessary in many places.</p>
<p>Third, the film "Spring Silkworms" should strengthen the tragic mood, such as Lao Tongbao's failure and the pressing for repayment of mulberry debts. I had discussed this with the screenwriter, but due to faithfulness to the novel, modifications were not made.</p>
<p>However, these are only minor shortcomings. These points should be noted regarding the attempt to adapt a novel into a film. (Ling He)</p>
<p>(3) The Meaning of Ideology</p>
<p>Speaking of the ideology of this film, we cannot but talk about the original author's handling of this subject matter. Obviously, after watching the entire film, we cannot find the author's central ideology. Naturally, "the lack of bizarre and tortuous plots, the lack of lingering and sentimental love stories..." will not hinder the development of the story's ideology. However, it is not enough for the author to simply present "no glamorous and sensual thighs..." and just a sketch of rural life.</p>
<p>"Spring Silkworms" is based on the theme of rural bankruptcy. Why exactly are the villages bankrupt? To what extent is the bankruptcy? What is the current state of the rural problem? The film does not fully inform the audience. I know that someone will immediately raise a serious question: aren't there many subtitles and tables at the beginning of the film explaining the decline of Chinese silk, the encroachment of Japanese silk on the market, and the impact of the war on the silk market's inability to open?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, I do not deny the need for subtitles and tables, but it is well known that films should not rely excessively on the explanation of subtitles and tables. However, in many important places in the beginning of "Spring Silkworms," where scenes that could express the "phenomena" and the roots of the problem could force the story towards a more tense stage, simple explanatory tables were leisurely used instead. As a result, the whole play develops blandly, without a high point, and without letting the audience understand how serious and terrible rural bankruptcy is, who the creators of rural bankruptcy are, and what we should do.</p>
<p>When we see a work of art, if it makes us think about doing something, then that work is successful. After watching "Spring Silkworms," we only know that there is a farmer, Lao Tongbao, in the countryside who failed to raise silkworms, and that's all. Is this the completion of the artist's task? In the current stage of China, rural bankruptcy has the possibility and the fact of causing the entire old society to collapse and rebuild a new society, and the original author and screenwriter are the incumbents of the literary and film circles. Our requirements cannot but be very high.</p>
<p>Usury plays a large role in rural bankruptcy and is also a pressure in the development of the whole play of "Spring Silkworms," but in the film, Tongbao picking up cigarette butts and pointing at ladies wearing silk to avoid description are written about. The description of the futility of superstition is successful. There is not much achievement in silkworm education, because basically those are old methods, and the prospect of a scientific and large-scale silkworm industry is not shown to the audience.</p>
<p>(4) The Director's Achievements or Shortcomings</p>
<p>Now let's examine the directorial techniques of the film "Spring Silkworms."</p>
<p>The main theme of "Spring Silkworms" is to express rural bankruptcy. It attempts to realistically depict the difficult life of Lao Tongbao's family raising silkworms. However, we feel that the director has not fully grasped the main theme, because the silkworm raising life of Lao Tongbao's family, in their bankruptcy life where they have been exploited in every possible way and are so poor that they only have the only hope (silkworms), is so serious and tense. However, the screen does not give the audience satisfaction in this regard, always making people feel bland and loose. This is because the director did not put effort into the depiction of those characters with different personalities and the emotions they should express towards the silkworms. The most obvious example is that during the development of the silkworm's one eye, two eyes, three eyes, and even big eyes, the family's emotions should obviously gradually increase. In this way, it is possible to avoid the problems of blandness and looseness to a considerable extent. However, the director makes us feel that the family's emotions about the silkworm's growth are stuck on a plane, without any change. Therefore, that kind of tense atmosphere cannot be created. Also, those close-ups of silkworms are certainly very necessary, but if the director wants the audience to only pay attention to the silkworms themselves, but does not fully connect the characters' emotions about the silkworms, it will certainly greatly weaken the effect of the film. For example, when the silkworms are brought to be weighed, the family's joyous expression is not shown on the screen in conjunction. This reduces the effect greatly. The director later connected A Duo and others in the display of the cocoons, and the effect was much greater than the previous individual display of the cocoons. The display of cocoons in the front can actually be omitted, not only does it have no meaning in itself, but it also gives a bad influence on the subsequent display.</p>
<p>In addition, the director should be responsible for the improper dubbing. However, the director still has many achievements. Due to space limitations, I will not go into detail. In general, this is a much more progressive work by Mr. Cheng Bugao than before. (He Lian)</p>
<p>(5) Acting Skills and Others</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the performances of the actors in "Spring Silkworms" are all very good. From beginning to end, no actor is perfunctory. Unfortunately, we can't find any outstanding spots among them. Comparatively, the three actresses Yan Yuexian, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and Gao Qianping perform well. Apart from being a bit "greasy," Little Zheng's performance is the most successful in terms of personality. Originally, it is inevitable that there will be affectation or exaggeration for the stars who are used to playing beautiful characters to play farmers and peasants. Therefore, it is really not easy for Miss Gao to walk these few steps of a village girl like this. Xiao Ying's Lao Tongbao originally had a good play to do, but unfortunately he failed to perform the deepness of this stubbornness and sophistication to the home. This has a great relationship with his makeup. Xiao Ying is big-hearted and fat, and it seems that he is not suitable to play this role called Tongbao (treasure) but his fate is not smooth and there is no treasure. As for the rest, such as A Tu, who is a poor peasant who owes rice, should not be played by someone who is as fat as an oil vat master. In terms of clothing, it is generally appropriate. However, Duoduo Tou never changed his clothes from beginning to end, and Lao Tongbao always wears a felt hat. Laborers do not even have time to wipe their sweat in this busy schedule. Except for the scabby head, they will not love this felt hat as life. The debt collector after receiving the cocoons also wears a pointed melon rind hat, which is also not in line with the facts. A audience member behind me who was talking about modern long and modern short said that the exterior scene at the beginning was a "snow scene." I don't know if it was his illusion or if there was a real problem with the lighting of this film? The interior scene is too dark. Except for the introducer on the stage being unclear, these three families are difficult to distinguish. On the contrary, the dubbing is too noisy, which makes the audience feel uncomfortable. The sound of rain is the biggest example. As for the rest, when Duoduo Tou is guarding the silkworms and Hehua comes to steal them, the dubbing simply does not have the mood of a late spring night. I think that after the mulberry leaves have been eaten up and Lao Tongbao and others come back from picking leaves, the sound of hungry silkworms eating leaves can be dubbed out, but it is not in this film. There are also mistakes in the set. In addition, there are a few small problems that need to be pointed out. The fat rich man who Lao Tongbao borrowed money from still appears in the Wuxi Cocoon Bank. Gen Sheng comes back from such a heavy rain carrying mulberry leaves on his shoulders, and he takes off his clothes on the bamboo recliner, wouldn't the whole floor of the house be wet? The habit of farmers is to remove wet straw raincoats and hats outdoors under the eaves. Here I have two small opinions: Why do several women always wash clothes by the creek several times, wouldn't it be better to change to washing rice and vegetables a few times? (Lu Jia)</p>
<h3>British Film Industry in India</h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>The film industry in India is still very young. They are far from being comparable to the film industries of the United Kingdom, the United States, or any other country, which is to be expected. Therefore, their film industry is completely unorganized and the film market is completely occupied by other countries.</p>
<p>The UK imports the most films into India. Almost all of India's film industry is occupied by the UK. The UK's annual turnover in India reaches more than 100,000 pounds, according to a detailed survey by the Indian Film Industry Association. As for the goods imported by film companies established in India, the total value of raw films is 188,400 pounds per year, and cameras are 231,150 pounds.</p>
<p>The Indian film industry is still in the silent film era. The Indian production industry has a total capital of 1,835,000 pounds, with 606 actors. There are 451 sound film actors and 155 silent film actors. There are 45 producers, but the films produced are not enough to meet the needs of Mumbai alone.</p>
<p>Although the British film industry dominates the Indian market, they also have considerable interest in Chinese films. Within the Chinese film region of Southeast Asia, there are sometimes Indian sales venues for Chinese films. Although the status of Chinese films abroad is very small, they can still occupy some position in India. The reason why Indians like to watch Chinese films is not clear, but the British film industry's domination in India has ultimately made the sales venues of Chinese films in India decline.</p>
