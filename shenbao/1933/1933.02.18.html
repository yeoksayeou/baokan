<p>但又來電聲明更正</p>
<p>（東京）日政府本日午后四時開臨時閣議、協議對國聯策之結果、正式决定退出國聯、（十七日電通社電）</p>
<p>日本電通社更正　逕啟者、前電係屬誤傳、因退出國聯事、尙須經明日閣議討論、特此奉告、</p>
<p>（東京）日臨時緊急閣議今日下午四時四十五分在緊張空氣之下開會、齋藤首相·内田外長荒木陸長·大角海長高橋財長外各閣僚全部出席、首先由内田外長分佈國聯十九國委員會勸告文、一部至四部之印刷刋物、並詳細報告國聯經過、與各國政府之對國聯態度、其次進入審議、其間經過大角海相·鳩山文相·中島商相·對外交上之詳細責問、最後荒木陸相具體說明熱河軍事形勢與日本應取方策、審議經二小時十五分、下午七時散會、因事態關係重大、明日繼續開開、預定正式决定後、另開重臣會議愼重討議後發表云、</p>

<p>（東京）日政府斷念國聯之態度、卒决心退出者、其根本理由如下、㈠不過在各國家間爲單純組合之現在國聯、儼然採超國家的裁判機關之態度、乃完全變質的、不能容許、㈠國聯爲威爾遜相互保障之原及克理滿梭勢力均衡之原則兩者之混合物、以不公正之領土分配爲基礎、蔑視人種平等之原則而成立者、成立當初已有歐洲國聯化之觀、日本不過從尊重和平之精神參加而已、㈠國聯之政治能力範圍、僅及於歐洲局部的事情、還元於歐洲國聯、乃爲當然、㈠因遠東問題與日本有密接關係之美俄兩國、旣未加入、僅日本參加、絶無效果、㈠國聯規約不備且不撤底、關於自衛權行使與排貨旣無明確規定、又對於與美國同樣有特殊事情之遠東、又不規定適用門羅主義、日本認爲無再留在國聯之必要、（十七日電通社電）</p>

<h3>日内瓦面面觀</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）日本退出國聯之形勢、現似日臻顯著、此固爲一般人所太息、但各國對於中日爭議中此種結果之態度、頗不一致、</p>
<h3>日本退出小國欣幸</h3>
<p>各小國一致齊唱積極適用國聯盟約條文之高調、今對於日本之出會、當然視爲大勝利、各小國抱此態度、非爲對日仇意或對華友誼所激成、但其主要志願、在使國聯盟約成爲强制解决爭議之眞正工具耳、南美諸國在此遠東爭議下未有直接關係、但彼等欲國聯具有强令嗜戰國家接受其裁判之權力、</p>
<h3>公正觀念大壯聲威</h3>
<p>愛爾蘭之行動亦屬一乘至公、絶無私念存乎其中、雖有數方面以爲南愛自由邦代表勒斯特肆其個人活動、實則現有理由可信渠所受之訓令、較其所已行者更進一步也、捷克代表皮尼士·瑞士代表摩太·西班牙代表瑪達利加·瑞典代表恩登等、皆欲見國聯在國際政治中具眞正力量、而爲小國之保障、以拒强鄰之侵略、此彼等之所以奮其全力、以期對於派兵佔據中國土地之日本下一判斷也、彼等所慮者、將來歐洲或發生同樣情形、今故努力以推翻此前例、</p>
<h3>法國政策擁護盟約</h3>
<p>法國政策近已大變、其所以然者、因欲共固國聯盟約、并覺在此種變更中於已有利也、雖法國未必贊成制裁、但其態度將傾向於擁護國聯盟約之政策、</p>
<h3>波蘭旁觀俄持嚴正</h3>
<p>波蘭在遠東無重大利益、始終維持旁觀態度、但最足使人驚異者、爲蘇俄之態度、蘇俄已藉機會斥責日本在滿之政策、此乃觀於軍縮會開會時俄外交委員長李雜諾夫所宣佈侵略國之定義而可見者也、德國表示挾犬逐兎之趨勢、但其國内現狀糾紛不寗、故無論此後時局如何變化、德國未必有得重要海動也、</p>
<h3>美入國聯終必實現</h3>
<p>尙有一事、使許多國聯會員國對於日本之退出國聯、不抱多大惶慮者、蓋覺現有更大之可能性、美國將被曳入國聯範圍也、有若干方面預料在一九三五年以前、美國當已加入國聯矣、</p>
<h3>日縱脫退仍受拘束</h3>
<p>雖照目前現象察之、日本在下星期之杪將脫離日内瓦、但在盟約第一條下日本非預有兩年之通告、不能退出國聯、故至少在今後兩年中、無論如何日本將仍爲國聯之會員、且爲行政院之理事、百以日代表松岡之離此、雖爲驚人的示威行動之性質、然在實際上不能變更最近將來之局勢也、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>荒木再肆咆哮</h3>
<p>侵熱預定政策</p>
<p>排斥外力干涉</p>
<p>軍部對國聯力主强硬</p>
<p>（東京）荒木陸長因連日來全國謠諑蠭起、股市狂跌、財界混亂、爲安頓人心、今晨對記者界發表談話、謂自從十九國委員會勸告文發表後、國民對國家前途似有所顧慮、其實不過國民之杞憂耳、我日本政府堅决執行旣定方針、任何勢力都不足以干涉我國策、對侵熱軍事、已是旦夕問題、軍部與「滿洲國」已恊力在近日中實行、對國聯退出問題、無須再行考慮、不論何時都可以隨意退出、至於退出後之應付、早已充分準備、以待任何勢力之干涉或侵犯云、（十七日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）今晨各報皆登載陸相荒木昨夜對新聞記者所發關於熱河與國聯建議案之談片、據謂日本政府尙未有最後决定、但日本必將不得已退出國聯、因建議案完全與日本所已定承認「滿洲國」·中日直接談判·及駐兵滿洲之政策相反也、至於日本對熱之立塲、則認定熱河爲「滿洲國」内部問題、與國聯或任何他人無涉、對熱之軍事行動、在最近將來中或將發作云、朝日新聞今晨載長春消息、謂「滿洲國」不日將發表一文、聲明不欲將熱河戰事擴至長城之南、除非中國迫令其有此舉動耳、如屬必要、戰區擴大、則負責者應爲中國云、今晨各報載稱、今日舉行内閣會議以考慮國聯建議案、據讀賣新聞消息、内閣將開會兩日、今日討論退出國聯問題、明日則决定熱河問題、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍省參謀本部等之高級官員、全部集合於陸軍省、討論國聯對策、聽取歐洲通之本間大佐之意見、謂退出國聯後第十六條之適用、即武力壓迫及經濟封鎖、但言之甚易而行之甚艱、即使實行、亦僅金融業因匯兌低落而呈衰象、可不作憂也、又南洋委任統治之諸島、實際上法理上皆應歸日本管理也云云、全體意見亦經一致、然退出之當然結果、軍縮全權是否撤回抑或縮小、亦經討論、有謂全部撤回、恐爲國聯所乘、故經愼重討論後、决定軍縮全權暫不撤回、待機而定、（十七日電通社電）</p>

<h3>美官塲憂慮遠東醖釀大戰</h3>
<p>倘如十九軍之抗日精神</p>
<p>中日戰事必擴大至華北</p>
<p>日本有封鎖中國可能</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據官塲之觀察、目前遠東之情形、實爲九一八事變後最嚴重之時期、今日據海陸軍研究之結果、認爲因熱河之形勢、致促成日軍封鎖中國海岸、實非不可能之事、如熱河之華軍能如十九路軍在滬之努力抗日、則戰事必將延及長城以南之地帶、於是中日間之正式宣戰、或將難免、若事實之演進、竟至宣戰之程度、則日軍封閉中國之海口、爲第二步驟云、此種意見、雖爲專門注意遠東形勢發展人等之推測、但於此足徴美國人士對於遠東形勢之嚴重關切矣、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日與國聯正面衝突中美國對日政策之觀察</h3>
<p>華盛頓訊、美國朝野對於日内瓦之中日問題發展、異常興　、咸注目於國聯之如何最後對付日本、一般輿論覺滿洲問題一經離開國聯之手、則將立即展成爲一種嚴重之美日間問題、故咸猜測下屆總統羅斯福之政策、但羅氏目下似亦未有一種决定的政策、須視時局之發展爲轉移、對於美國態度之一般觀察、以爲無論美國是否圖經由日本而發展其在東方之市塲、或圖不惜一戰壓倒日本、而實現其東方政策、總須首先决定其政策之根本原則、下屆總統羅斯福將如何决定其原則、乃一大問題、但將依於美國之經濟情形而决定之、則無疑義、假使一九三三年美國能得到如一九二二年華府會議時之繁榮狀况、則可預料美國之外交及軍備、將成爲日本遠東政策之一大脅害、由此點以觀、可知美國之對日政策、繫於羅斯福政府之行政能力、而一般人對此新政府、咸期其具有調整經濟不振、致成所想望之繁榮之能力云、（世界社）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國攻變所給與東方問題之影響晦</h3>
<p>（一）　一九三三年初頭之世界</p>
<p>過去一年中世界經濟仍處於恐慌狀態之中。在去年夏季一般物價與股票證券價格。尤見低落七月似有轉機。十月以後。又轉而傾於緩慢跌落之動向或可謂爲停止狀態。是以此種情形。樂觀者每以爲世界經濟恐慌。已達極底。公債私債之信用不安。已漸趨緩和。此後將次上昇。堆棧積蓄。日漸减少。市塲交易漸次活潑。今後市面。必日趨良好。至少目前已轉換沈衰之方向。而爲新市面之象徴。</p>
<p>不過此種新市面之轉機。第一須投資活動重新擴大資本利得尤須較前增高。第二須物品消售市塲再度擴張。其吸收能力。更當在今日所有生產能力之上。然而以當前情勢而論。投資範圍勢難再行擴張資本利得尤缺增高之希望。則是第一種投資活動之條件。即同夢幻。而物品消售市塲。并非近年始發生之新問題歐洲大戰之起因。爭奪市塲。即屬其一。分割殖民地爲其主要因素。時至今日。（世界）滄海桑田之變化。决不能滿足目下慾望於萬一。又絶無第二新大陸足資排洩過剩生產物。城市與農村之購買能力。未有絲毫增加。一般市場又安能擴大。則是第二種消售市場之擴張。亦屬絶望矣。</p>
<p>是故資本主義各國自身之對立競爭。非常激烈。開疆拓土之企圖。蓋勝於任何理論上主義上之爭鬥。而蘇聯以後起國家。獨自另創新制。向社會主義前途邁進。於現世各國不無精神的妨碍。而「聯合進攻蘇聯」之說。又未免爲平面觀察。亦忽視各國間自已利害衝突之嚴重性也。不過防備「赤化。」則資本主義各國同具此心理。故德國當經濟瀕於破產。政治極度動搖之際。英法對德要求賠欵。不能不設法減低。以至完全停付。軍備制限。亦不得不略爲顧全德意志之要求。而承認原則上之平等。</p>
<p>德意志於極頽廢失望之餘。國家社會黨乃挾其中層羣衆。懷未來希望。一躍而登政治舞臺。以從事於救援德意志。另換一世界新局面。取消凡爾賽和約。打破一切束縛以復興德國。是乃希脫拉之政治前題。及至今日其實行力究竟何如。恐仍將與英法金融資本家暗中携手。政治則暫維現狀。壓抑共產黨活動。爲其急務。對威瑪爾憲法。依依然表示遵從。至於法蘭西更換内閣。殆爲一種週期的政變。於世界關係。殊甚細微。</p>
<h3>㈡列强對日本侵華之觀念</h3>
<p>德國政權旣由中央黨而歸入極右派之手。論理英法將表示驚慌。即爲戒備。而竟不驚慌不戒備者何哉。蓋希脫拉組閣。并未根本否認凡爾賽和約。於現制度尤未取任何攻擊態度。故英法正可利用以抵制蘇聯之西侵。而圖資本主義之新平衡也。</p>
<p>然而於國聯威信。則不能不加緊扶持。使之足以鎭服歐洲各國。足爲世界列國所共同信服。方足平德國之不平。防蘇聯之鼓動。維持列强之均勢。殊不料日本竟力主獨占。不顧一切。倚恃武力。由兼併東北三省進而公然宣言用兵熱河。直視國聯如無物。等我國主權於虛設矣。其所以如此猖獗。敢於冒世界之不韙爲人所不能爲者。以世界經濟恐慌未已。今後轉機何如。猶爲疑問耳。去年一年間世界生產總指數。（蘇聯除外）較之一九二八年。乃跌落百分之三十三。而英美法德主要各國。并皆低落自百分之十一至於百分之四十三。此種形勢。即明白表現各國國力。疲弊已達極點。而今日國際關係。複雜綜錯。國際戰爭。尤須舉其國力以從事。乃可應付。際此各國皆陷於萬分困疲之中。豈能妄啓戰端。又豈敢輕啓戰端。</p>
<p>是以日本明知併呑東北。即爲打破國際均勢之起步。進攻熱河擾亂平津。乃爲破壞世界和平之鐵手。列國豈能容忍。然彼皆須顧及其國民經濟之衰退。力謀復興。對日本之武力侵略。不能不暫時放鬆。此瀋陽事變一年又五個月以還。列强所以因循輾轉者也。</p>
<p>德國政變旣起。西歐形勢。陡然一轉。而蘇聯聲勢日張。尤不可不慮。如國聯威信。盡喪於日本帝國主義侵略東北三省鐵蹄之下。則匪特歐洲各國。難得均衡偶。有爭端。無法解决。而負世界一時盛望。爲資本主義市塲問題最後生機之中國市塲。設爲日本所獨占。則世界經濟前途。更多險阻列國之經濟危機。更難解决。於是乎國聯十九人委員會。乃有抑制日本。主張否認僞國之提議雖然。我國如不能發揮其自身有效之實力。縱令國聯大會决議取消僞國。最多不過等於國聯主要强國對付日本之一種政治的示威而已。</p>

<h3>戒備森嚴羅斯福乘專車回紐約</h3>
<p>芝加谷市長等傷勢無變化</p>
<p>兇手以謀殺罪在法庭起訴</p>
<p>國民十六日紐約電　羅斯福專車將於明日抵此、當局擬派幹練警察一千名守衛車站及附近地方、另派大隊警察警備羅氏汽車所過各路、戒備之嚴、將爲向來而未見、蓋慮或有犯神經病者爲桑茄拉暗殺舉動所激動、再有意外行動云、</p>
<p>路透十六日紐約電、當選總統羅斯福之受警驚、與密芝根州銀行之停業、已牽動證券市面、今日垣街售出者奇旺、大都損失自一磅音至四磅音不等、收盤價漸回、成交數一百萬股、</p>
<p>路透社十七日紐約電　英皇發來一電、由英使署送交羅斯福、賀其脫險、英相麥唐納已有電到美慰問、</p>
<h3>羅斯福車中談出事經過</h3>
<p>國民十六日米亞米電　美國當選總統羅斯福今日再赴醫院慰問受傷諸春後、即乘專車返紐約、據其在車中談話、稱昨日初聞槍聲時、余亦與大衆同樣驚疑、猶以爲爆竹之聲、其時演說甫畢、返坐與塞麥克市長談話、適有人持電報來、報告内容、余離座而前、傾聽其語、即於此際槍聲突作、繼以迅速連續數響、車夫機警、立即開動車輪、余見塞麥克市長墮於車下、而數碼外又有吉爾夫人倒地、乃囑車夫停車、其時適有一暗探大呼車夫速離開羣衆、車又開駛、余第二次命其停車時、已有人舁塞麥克而去、乃囑其舁至車上、余撫其腕際、覺脈息已停、深恐其在抵醫院前不能復活、幸一分鐘後、即行蘇醒、余目下殊以其痊愈爲念云云、</p>
<h3>傷勢經過皆良好</h3>
<p>至塞氏傷勢、當今晨羅氏訪問時、睡臥較安貼、醫生謂已有幾分痊愈希望、吉爾夫人孫諾德與克魯士夫人傷勢雖重、均可望痊、輕傷之喀德偉爾昨訛傳爲五齡童子、今悉乃二十二歲之靑年、此外受傷者、頃悉尙有一暗探克拉克、此君實係第一人受傷、子彈先中其手、然後再貫芝加谷市長之胸、渠見羅未傷、恐兇手目標在市長、立躍至塞氏前、冀可代受子彈、旣見塞氏重傷、遂暫守其旁、嗣乃繼續保護羅斯福、不復提及所受之傷、據云、當時雖極疼痛、但傷勢不重、其人亦可謂忠於職務者矣、</p>
<h3>桑茄拉行兇好殺係天性</h3>
<p>至於兇手桑茄拉經徹夜詰問後、所供仍如前、謂渠生於意大利喀勒白利亞地方、年三十三、諒呱呱墮地時、即挾仇恨之心以俱來、故幼年在學校、見同學之勝於彼者、輙深爲嫉恨、十六歲乃作工、常與諸少年相鬥、尤恨官長、常欲殺之而後快、尤决意欲盡殺世間之富人與有權勢者、羅斯福即爲此中之一、渠心境常煩亂、自患胃痛後、殺心益熾、渠不屬任何黨派、此舉純係個人意志、生平好讀激烈文學、尤嗜論述無政府主義者直接行動之著作、至何以未嘗企圖暗殺美國其他官長、則桑氏祗諉稱未有好機會而已、桑茄拉雖侃侃直陳、問無不答、但警察對其供辭、仍不能滿意、深疑此種人、未有不求結識同志者、因此刻正細查各激烈機關、逆料偵查之後、或將發見其人屬於某種危險團體、尙有同謀者在也、</p>
<p>路透十六日米亞米電　桑茄拉今日由羅斯福之經濟顧問摩萊敎授研詢、據供、渠於共產主義、並無興趣、且不了解無政府主義之學說云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十七日華盛頓電、美國偵緝隊長摩根、認爲行剌羅斯福總統之兇手桑茄拉、係無政府黨人、與一九零一年行剌麥荆萊總統之兇手柯爾谷綏士相同、</p>
<h3>暗殺案法庭今日即開審</h3>
<p>國民電又稱、至羅斯福態度、據聞對於兇手並不憤怒、第覺國人中竟有懷戕害官吏之志願者、不無可憂耳、羅氏友人則欲信兇手定有神經病、此舉當與激烈派運動無關、現聞當局將控以意圖殺人之罪、並據美京總檢察長查聯邦法律、雖有誹謗總統之律、並無狙擊總統或當選總統條文、故此案將以本州地方法律起訴、又此間移民官吏初欲將兇手遞解出境、嗣向華盛頓調查、兇手已入籍美國、因此無從遞解出境、將於明日在此間法庭審問云、</p>
<p>路透十六日米亞米電　桑茄拉今日在刑事法庭正式被控謀殺當選總統羅斯福及其餘三人、每一罪案至大刑罰爲徒刑二十年、被告向法官狂呼曰、「余不欲任何人援手、爾爲法官、儘可任所欲爲、當經展期明日續審、且將指定最佳之律師爲其辯護、至芝加谷市長塞瑪克與佛洛里達州電氣公司總董吉爾之夫人被創、未加八訴狀、蓋如二人之一、不幸殞生則須控以一等謀殺罪、而有處死刑之可能也、</p>
<h3>羅夫人不欲密探護其夫</h3>
<p>路透十七日伊太加電　當選總統羅斯福之夫人來此演講、今日語路透訪員、渠不信宜以任何必要之戒備勸告其夫君、此次案件、决不能使其夫君擾亂、不過對於受傷者當然不能無動於中耳、渠不以爲其夫君常處於死神或將蒞臨之恐慌中云、</p>
<p>路透十六日紐約電　今日全國民衆對於陰謀暗殺羅斯福之企圖、一律表示憤慨、現當局對於羅之安全、已加以嚴重之注意、此後政將派警探八百人、暗隨羅氏左右、密爲保護、同時在最近期間對於其他各要人、均一律嚴加保衛云、但羅斯福夫人今日表示不願有密探保護彼個人及家庭之安全、彼稱、若暗殺之徒困欲殺汝、彼等終可達到目的、反不若行若無事、不加注意之爲愈云云、至於羅斯福本人、亦不願改變彼之日常工作、有人請彼减少慶祝會次數、及免去若干酬酢、羅竟表示託異云、</p>
<p>日英貿易競爭引起</p>
<h3>商約存廢問題</h3>
<p>英政府愼重考慮</p>
<p>路透社十六日倫敦電　今日當下議院開會時、斯旗璞城保社黨議員漢墨斯萊提議、因日本海外貿易對英競爭之劇烈、英日商約應即取消、漢氏謂除非英國能對日商品予以歧異之待遇、對日方之競爭、實難爲有效之制止、商部代表克爾維答稱、英國政府之政策、絶不主張對任何國家取消商約、但若取消後之利益較商約存在爲大時、則不在此限、至於受日商競爭影響之各英殖民地均得自由單獨對日取消英日商約、故無庸予以整個之取消、惟是次通知書必須於實行取消之一年以前發出云、克爾維末稱、此事已在政府之愼重考慮中云、</p>
<h3>法俄不侵犯條約批准</h3>
<p>塔斯十六日莫斯科電　此間今日發表、法蘇不侵犯條約、於去年十一日由蘇聯駐法大使杜夫加里夫斯基與法總理赫里歐在巴黎簽訂者、已於二月十一日經法總統里勃侖批准、該約又於二月十五日經蘇聯政府中執委會常務委員會批准、十五日由蘇聯外交副委員長克里斯丁斯基及法國駐蘇大使特琪恩在外交委員會交換雙方之批准文後、即宣布該約生效云、</p>

<p>中國代表對日又一聲明</p>
<h3>樸資茅條約之精神</h3>
<p>日内瓦通信、我國出席國際聯盟行政院代表顧維鈞氏、爲日本代表所發表十一月二十八日之備忘錄、與十二月六日及八日之在特别大會中演說、不但侮辱中國、且與事實不符、恐世人爲片面之詞所惑、爰再詳述眞相、特别注意中俄密約濟南慘案共產黨及東北懸　諸點、於十二月二十七日送達國聯秘書長、分交各會員國參考、原文係英文、茲照譯如下、</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>十一月二十一日、中國代表在行政院席上發言後、日本代表即於同月二十八日提出備忘錄、中國代表團亦旋於十二月三日致函於國聯秘書長、對日本代表團該備忘錄中所陳各點加以批駁、又日本代表在十二月六日及八日兩次特别大會席上之所表示、中國代表亦曾於八日下午會議時提出駁議、惟日本方面之備忌錄及聲明書中、尙有其他牽强奪理之點、爲中國方面所不能緘默者、茲再逐一指出其謬誤如下、</p>
<p>中國代表於十一月二十一日行政院席上、曾提出後藤新平男所著「在滿蒙日本軍隊及日本人之行動」一書、該書内容、述日本政府騷亂華士以阻撓中國統一之種種計畫、極爲詳盡、而日本代表在其備忘錄中、則辯稱後藤著是書時、已是在野之身、且其目的、亦僅爲内政的、不知著者書中資料、均係其本人在滿洲考察或在日本政府正式文卷中搜集所得、其所說種種、日本代表亦未否認、此點極可注意、日本代表又稱、中華民國成立之初、有一日本大佐在滿洲計劃復辟運動、日本政府得悉後、即設法阻止之、中國代表對於此事、並未提出、表示遺憾、不知日本政府之所以阻止此項運動者、其原因已詳見於後藤男之小册中矣、後藤之言曰、　「皇家政府與土井大佐對於滿洲之眞實情形、旣未甚熟悉、同時與專事擾亂中國治安之日本浪人之關係、亦未甚密切、故日本當局之在滿洲圖謀起事之計劃、完全失敗、惟一九一六年春間、仍能在大連集合二千餘衆、組成勤王軍、所惜日本雖耗鉅額金錢、而此等盜匪及苦力之輩、猶未能盡爲我用耳、」又關於田中奏摺一節、中國代表言之已詳、茲謹須指出一點、日本代表聲言前國民政府外長王正廷博士曾允許日本設法阻止該項文件之流通、王博士於十一月二十五日對中央通訊社記者談話時、已作有力的否認、此項消息、已遍載歐洲各報、尤有進者、夫允許阻止此項文件之流通、固絶不能即認爲接受日本對該文件眞實性之否認也、</p>
<p>日代表聲明書中、稱一九二七年日本政府將撤退駐在山東省省城濟南之日軍時、「曾接到蔣將軍政府之請求在該政府妥謀山東省安全之前、請日軍繼續駐留該處」、此項請求全屬虛構、中國政府固絶未出此也、</p>
<p>此外又有同樣重要之一事應注意者、即日代表已承認一九二八年間日本林權助男爵·林久次郎總領事·及佐藤安之助中將、曾力勸張學良將軍勿與南京中央政府携手、日本對此項阻撓中國政治統一之嘗試之解釋、則諉稱係出於張學良將軍之自願、中國代表曾以上電詢張將軍、茲已得復電、内稱「日本對余之願望果能如此盡心、則試問何以對於其他事件、竟完全反余之意而行乎、當時日本之干涉事實、中外官塲均熟知之、無待多贅、如須提出證據、則尙有許多書面文件可爲證、余當時如不願樹靑天白日旗、則靑白旗何竟飛揚於東北各處耶」、</p>
<p>日本代表團於誣稱中國未能履行條約義務之外、又稱國民政府公然堅持採取排外政策、中國代表團於此固已屢次發表宣言及聲明、說明日方此說之爲謬矣、</p>
<p>茲姑提出一例爲證、一九三二年六月一日、中國海關雇用人員、計共八千八百三十二人、其中九百二十四人爲外籍人員、日本籍者括一百九十九人、滿洲各關日員、亦包括在内、渠等現幾全數放棄其效忠清神、而加入「滿洲國」之服務、然中國政府對此等日員、除大連稅務司福本順太郎以抗命被撤職外、均未予以停職處分、現在職位僅次於總稅務司之秘書長亦爲日籍、試問中國之絶無排外政策、尙有較此更爲顯著之證明乎、</p>
<p>日代表宣言中又稱、</p>
<p>「中國代表指出政府機關中外籍人員之數額、以爲中國並無排外情感之證明一節、實不足憑、蓋中國政府之接受此等外員、僅以條約及協定上明白規定、不得不然耳、」</p>
<p>日代表此言、不特不能證明中國政府有所謂排外思想、仰且可見日本誣指中國之不能履得條約義務一節、已爲其自已之發言所反證、蓋日本雖極盡挑撥、甚至侵入中國國土之東三省、而中國則仍尊重其條約之義務、然以中日兩國之交誼言、以在中國海關服務之多數日員之不忠而加入僞國服務之事實言、中國即將所有日員、全數撤職、亦自有充分之理由也、</p>
<p>日代表宣言書中、又稱在中國鹽務及若干鐵路服務之外籍人員、已多數被逐、此說亦屬不確、中國政府爲節省開支增進效率、並顧全公衆利益起見、因曾有革興諸端、對人員亦有更動之事、然其更動結果、則不特無所謂「大不幸之影響」、且實有極顯著之進步、即就鹽務稽核所而言、一九二八年九月二十六日國民政府明令將該所正式劃歸財政部、同時並規定全國各稽核處一律恢復、其稅收有不能全數撥歸中央者、至少應將一部分撥匯國庫、以爲歸償國債之需、實行後、效率大著、財政部長宋子文氏於本年八月間發表其中國財政進展報告、内稱至一九二九年九月間、該項計劃、已極多成就、財部不僅可以每年如數撥付欠欵、即過去未清舊欠、亦可逐步清償、一九三零年終、英法及克利斯浦借欵之積欠利息、悉已清償、所有積欠本金、亦開始償付、其應由鹽稅項下撥付之、湖廣借欵欠欵部分、亦於一九三一年完全清償、（未完）</p>
<h3>劉文輝回成都後策略</h3>
<p>文取成都武取潼綿</p>
<p>壓抑田鄧擴大地盤</p>
<p>成都通信、川戰停止後、劉文輝以前方旣無重兵壓境、當然回師成都、并决定採用「文取成都武取潼綿」的戰略、而佔據成都的田頌堯、因後方爲共匪襲擊、劉湘又以白眼相待、故祇有屈服於劉文輝威脅之下、於是劉文輝不費一兵一卒之力、收復成都、但劉文輝的希望、不僅要收復成３</p>
<p>都、並且以整個軍事力量、抑壓田頌堯鄧錫侯、使完全屈服、其對田的策略、㈠要求田割讓十縣防地、作二十四軍的供養、㈡成都兵工廠、應歸二十四軍所有、以便供給械彈、以充實西康邊防、對鄧的策略、㈠退還前次所讓之華陽·簡陽·資陽三縣、㈡解决參加作戰的黃隱師和陳書農師、㈢二十八軍統治下之成都市政府、應歸二十四軍所有、否則即從事軍事解决、田鄧當以爲自已的力量、没有二十四軍充實、萬難抵抗、祇有以和平手段向劉要好、但劉文輝態度的崛强、决非和平手段所可解决結果、田允剿匪軍事告一段落後、割讓五縣予二十四軍、要求在剿匪時期中、不要以重兵侵犯、聞劉已有相當的允諾、因此田頌堯帶着滿腹的憂憤而回潼川、計劃剿匪、至於鄧錫侯對劉、一面將駐成都之陳書農部完全調赴資陽、避免與二十四軍直接發生衝突、一面派參謀長牛範九遊說劉文輝及二下四軍之保定系將領、說明二十八軍目前所處的困境、請求讓步、鄧并向劉表示、㈠交出成都市政府、㈡退還華陽·簡陽·兩縣防地、至於黃隱師之解决、恐無辦法、因此郫縣灌縣崇寗等縣之黃師防地、已開始高掘戰壕、防範二十四軍進攻、但黃隱亦親到成都奔走、冀謀緩頰、要之、最近的形勢、異常緊張、不過劉文輝因所部將領中之保定系同學關係、多不願壓迫二十八軍、亦表示對鄧本人諒解、惟對黃隱、非給以創傷不可、現在鄧正向劉商洽處置黃師問題、鄧在此壓迫之下、旣未因親善劉湘而得到多少利益、反而與劉文輝交惡、當亦深悔不值矣、且二十四軍已於二月二三兩日、正式接收華陽簡陽兩縣數日後將再接收成都市政府、此刻二十四軍在成都地位、實高於鄧田、尤其是鄧氏更有難堪的情景、據軍事當局傳出消息、謂黃隱師處置問題、現尙未得到相當的解决、目前黃隱的生死權、似已全在劉文輝把握之下、故鄧錫侯態度、異當消極、想更非鄧氏初料所及也、</p>

<h3>歡迎與標語</h3>
<p>昨日清晨、絡續赴碼頭歡迎者、有中國電影文化會代表上海劇團聯合會代表洪深·戲劇協會代表應雲衛·上海各學生劇社援助義軍游藝大會代表團·及崇拜蕭氏之靑年男女四百餘人、各執歡迎旗幟、高張歡迎蕭氏標語、亟盼一覩蕭氏豐采、並致誠悃、民權保障同盟會林語堂·邵洵美·中外新聞記者二十餘人、亦鵠候蕭氏蒞臨訪問、自晨六時至逾午十二時許、興采並不稍衰、熱烈情形、爲歷來少見、上海學生劇社援助義軍遊藝大會、並發表宣言、歡迎蕭氏來滬、最後之口號如下、歡迎革命藝術家蕭伯訥、歡迎戲劇家蕭伯訥、歡迎和平之神蕭伯訥、歡迎同情中國土地完整的　歡迎同情中國獨立解放的蕭、歡迎反帝國主義的先鋒蕭、歡迎蕭要打倒帝國主義、歡迎蕭要反對日本進攻華北、、歡迎蕭反對第二次世界大戰、歡迎蕭不要做時代的落伍者、</p>

<h3>梅蘭芳列席</h3>
<p>蕭氏等抵世界學社時、座中先到有梅蘭芳·董恭綽·張歆海·及其夫人·邵間美·唐瑛女士·等、由張歆海一一介紹、與蕭握手爲禮、當介紹梅蘭芳時、蕭氏與之立談頗久、由張歆海氏　譯、蕭氏謂英國戲劇演時無鐵鼓等聲音、董演劇時一有雜聲、即損害觀衆注意力、而中國演劇時、頗學遇鬧、梅答稱、中國戲劇有兩種、如崑曲即爲不鬧之一、慕恭綽氏當即謂梅君之演劇、並無鬧聲、有之亦爲音樂之相助而已、梅君繼即致景慕之詞、並言余舞台生活、已有三十年、平素知愛爾蘭人富於忠實友誼、今後甚願與蕭氏認識、儿一朋友、蕭碈聞梅君已有三十年之舞台生活、而注視其面容曰、君誠有駐顏術哉、蕭柢與梅君談後、即起立作幽默之演說、大要如下、此刻演說不必要、因在座諸君均爲著作家、我誠爲班門弄斧、普通人均視作家爲神秘偉大之人物、今諸君皆盡知内容多言何益、况作家實亦勞工、不過其工資較之勞工更少耳、此時林語堂向蕭氏言、先生自已未必盡然、（蓋蕭氏所著各書、在英國版稅所抽獨重、）蕭氏答以我之作品、非均有收入者、（按蕭氏之凡關於社會問題之小册子成演說等、例不收費、）且我之戲劇賺錢、皆爲演戲者所贈我、在座梅君、可證明此言不虛也、繼蕭氏又謂、我在此正如一動物院中之陳列品、諸君已看過、我亦不必多言矣、演講後、葉恭綽問蕭氏不吃肉之原因、蕭氏云、余所需要並無原因、余不喜吃肉、即不吃肉、後由筆會將北平東安市塲泥製之戲裝鬼臉、裝一錦盒、連同古繡衣一件、相贈蕭氏、賞鑑之下、喟然曰、戲中有戰士·老生·小生·花旦·惡魔·之不同、均能於面貌上鑒别之、惟吾人面目、大都相同、而内性則未必相似也、其語意甚幽默、令人耐味、</p>
<p>蕭翁出世界社時攝影（李尊庸攝）</p>
<h3>對中國印象</h3>
<p>蕭氏於下午三時許、離世界社返莫利愛路孫宅、即在孫宅園内接見中外各報社記者、記者首先叩問蕭氏此行對中國印象、蕭柢聳肩笑答、表示此問之答復、實非一二短語所能盡述、蓋猶如一著作家寫游二十卷多帙之巨著、非一時之能怱怱作完者然、蕭氏曰、余今年已七十有七、當余行抵世界各地、凡遇新聞記者時、必以此語叩余、無論在寒地熱帶、其實世界之現象、總是如此、且余抵中國爲期尙暫、故目下無整個印象、足以說述、</p>
<h3>無文化可言</h3>
<p>其次蕭氏又批評及於中國文化之缺點、渠稱中國與東方、苦無文化之可言、蓋文化一義、如照科學解釋、即爲凡一切人類行爲之可以增進人類幸福者、尤其對於大自然之控制、在中國除田鄉聞尙可尋求其少許文化外、此外殊無文化可言、中國今日乃向西歐搬取許多已經失有效用遺害大衆之所謂「文化」、譬如議會之起、人民不欲有政府、英國人民利用議會、首則推倒帝王之統治、次又推翻敎堂之威權、但最後却不曾推倒資本之勢力、因其源資本所操者也、又如英國之大學、幾乎將個人之自由意志、摧殘凈盡、而取陳腐無用之老古董、灌入學生之頭腦、使成爲有一定格式之人物、到某時何事、某境有何反應、董可預料而定者、似此種所謂西方文化、中國搬之何益、</p>
<h3>被壓迫民族</h3>
<p>記者旋詢蕭氏東方被壓迫民族、如何始能謀得出路、蕭氏沈思後答釋、上項問題、殊難作覆、不如俟余離開上海後、再作答覆、因爲在此地說話、似乎不甚安全也、時另一記者質詢蕭氏謂、此種答覆、對於中國、殊少帮助、蕭氏至時乃詳爲解釋、亦曾言及資本主義之崩潰、馬克斯主義之精神、及蘇維埃俄羅斯革命之方法等、暢談不已、</p>
<h3>述革命方法</h3>
<p>蕭氏對一問題、旣經開始、即暢論不已、故由上述弱小民族之出路問題、乃不覺談及革命方法問題、蕭碈曰、余過香港時、曾囑學生革命、但請勿誤會、余非勸令學生至街上毆打警察、當警察持提到塲鎭壓時、其最妥善之方法、即爲奔逃、且須儘速奔逃、以免頭破血流、切不必與警察對峙、蓋警察似强盜手中之手槍、吾你遇盜時、决不願與手槍對抗、但欲打倒彼持槍之人、此須用組織計劃而不可蠻挺也、即筘工人爲要求待遇而罷工、其結果亦必凍餓、余以社會主義之立塲、反對罷工、惟在今日之環境中、此項手段、有時亦不得不採取耳、</p>
<h3>頗揄揚蘇俄</h3>
<p>繼稱、蘇俄年來内部之現象、無論精神上與物質上、均有良好與充分之表現、然此種有規模之進步、不僅蘇俄自身能得極好之利益、獲取美滿之成功、在其他各國、亦足資借鏡、取彼所長、摹仿而實行之、蕭氏並堅决表示觀察云、彼信社會主義、早晚必得普遍實行於世界各國、雖革命之手段和步驟、各個國家、其所採取之方式、容或不同、但殊途同歸、至最後之終點、必仍趨於一途、而成爲一水平線、至於蘇俄革命之成功、亦可謂由於俄國帝制時代對於政治犯之待遇太苛所養成、驅諸有異樣政治思想之人於西比利亞、適結一般革命情緒堅决之人、以讀書深思研究組織之機會云云、時有俄報記者在旁、突語蕭氏云、彼於離國境時、所見俄國境内之情狀、但見紛亂不堪、並未如所譽之棊甚、於是蕭氏又斷然告之曰、君所語者、實係若離俄時一九二二年之所見、非最近蘇俄之情况也、倘君於此時返國一觀察、（假如今日君返國之後而仍能逃走者）必知今日情形之甚佳矣、僅憑過去之觀察、以衡現在之蘇俄、當然不能知最近蘇俄進步之速也、</p>
<h3>英對華政策</h3>
<p>記者又詢以英國對華政策如何、蕭氏微笑答稱、英國人士可謂無一人認識中國、故根本談不到政策、又謂、李頓報告書可稱公平、然以篇幅過長、恐無人能全部予以熟讀耳、蕭氏談至此、稍頓、繼謂今日英國本身問題、急待解决者至多、决無餘暇再過問中國之事也、</p>
<h3>需要爲實際</h3>
<p>氏又謂、中國今日所需要者爲良好政府、要知好政府及好官吏、絶非一般民衆所歡迎、中國爲政、每苦言論過多、殊無實在效果、故最需要者莫若實際之工作云、</p>
<h3>上海甚惡劣</h3>
<p>最后、記者叩以君對上海興趣若何、碈謂上海至爲惡劣、又問君對世界二次大戰作何感想、據答、二次大戰、吾人俟其到臨可也、毌庸今日鰓鰓之過慮云云、談約四十五分鐘之久、記者以蕭翁已微露倦容、遂相率告辭、蕭氏復與宋等略談、至四時半仍由孫夫人楊杏佛等、伴往碼頭、乘渡輪送至吳淞、登英國皇后輪、孫夫人等直至八時許、始返宅、蕭氏、婦乘輪亦於當晚十一時啓椗、駛赴秦皇島、</p>
<h3>翁照垣函蕭</h3>
<p>英國當代大文豪蕭伯納來滬、並參觀淞滬戰地、抗日名將翁照垣將軍、特請殷芝齡代表歡迎、持贈英文淞滬血戰回憶錄一册、並致蕭氏函云、蕭伯納先生鑒、欣承先生來華、並視察一二八淞滬戰役之遺址、照坦以事離滬、不能陪駕、殊抱歉仄、茲謹贈拙著英文淞滬血戰回憶錄一册、爲先生來華之紀念、且使先生親見强暴者砲火餘燼之後、更披閱是册、可知當時被壓迫民族浴血苦戰、可泣可歌之情况、更仰先生爲當代文豪、平日嘔出心血、寫盡人類喜生惡死之哲學、領導羣倫、踏進和平大道、庸詎知際此泰東西競尙文明之世、我遠東尙有此狺狺者、日施其猙獰面貌、殘酷手腕、而視人類和平於弁髦耶、然則先生旣臨此境、復悉此情、對此人類、又不識灑幾許慈愛淚也、伏希珍重、翁照垣謹上、</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>武、將山東婦人擊傷頭腰兩部甚重、當經在旁者嗚捕到來、將行兇者拘獲、一面將受傷者車送醫院求治、聞傷勢極重、頗有生命之憂、㈡滬西憶定盤路第六十二號半某姓家、昨晨因自來水公司停供用水、事前並不知悉、致所生之水汀汽管、突然爆裂、當塲死去傭婦一名、亦云慘矣、</p>

<h3>工部局再考慮</h3>

<h3>怎樣奮鬥？</h3>
<p>丨陳君來信丨</p>
<p>前日看了先生答復任月望君的信（殺問題）後，我還有不明白之處，敢請先再指示一下因我也是時時懷着「自殺」這個念頭的。</p>
<p>我是一個商店中的學徒，終日過着妈隷的生活，（這種痛苦的情形，我不知道要如何寫法纔好，總之是非常痛苦的！）除了「自殺」還有什麽辦法呢？（我也知道奮鬥，但不知如何奮鬥纔是，一旦我和黑暗勢力戰爭，我馬上有失業的危險，就是饑寒的危險。）</p>
<p>先生旣說：「自殺」是懦者可恥的心理，應該和黑暗社會奮鬥戰爭，但不知先生能告訴我們一個「怎樣鬥爭的法子否。」</p>
<p>答：你的信雖然說行很簡單，然而問的話却是極有道理，先就一般的情形答復如下：㈠學徒要想改良生活（一切職工都是如此，）必須要祛除一個舊觀念，即只從個人或本身着想的舊觀念。現在的社會是常有這一人羣與那一人羣對立的狀態。店東之所以敢於虐待學徒，也就是上述那種狀態表現之一端。爲今之計，做學徒的一方面團結大家的力量爲社會全般平民謀幸福，一方爲店員或學徒本身謀生活的改良，對於店方作各種合理的要求。我們曉得靑年店員，人人不但感受物質生活的困苦，並且感覺得精神生活，文化生活，那知識慾望的滿足之迫切的需要。學徒們應設法自已進行這一敎育工作　。此點若果辦到，然後才有其牠奮鬥可言。若大家只從個人着想，或許你也會有機會可以脫除店員或學徒的地位爬到店主人的地位，此則另一問題，非記者之所願聞，亦非記者之所敢知矣。</p>

<p>春秋關於蕭伯訥  廢名　　丨以流淚的歡笑來戲給這位大文豪啊丨　　在國人熟知的譯成中國姓名的世界大文豪中，恐怕要臬高爾基和蕭伯訥兩位老先生最享盛名吧。　　BernarShaw不譯成「伯訥蕭」，而譯作「蕭伯訥」，有人以爲是由於譯名者百家姓讀得太熟的綠故，其實這倒不如說是譯名者的一番苦心，因爲第一·「蕭伯訥」讀起來比「伯訥蕭」來得順品，第二，這位大文豪是一個帶着濃厚的中國風味的諷剌大家，除了口音與服裝飲食之外，他的一言一行都不類乎機械化的歐洲人，而倒酷肖滑稽化的東方人。「蕭伯訥」的譯名正是這位老先生的生活與個性接近東方風味的象徴。　　現在我們景仰的大文豪不遠萬里而來到中國了，他帶來的，不是毒殺我們的鴉片槍砲，而是深沉的反抗現杨黑暗的幽默情調。貧乏的我們應當用什麽獻給他老先生呢？我想没有别的，只有環繞着他的無邊的流淚的歡笑吧！　　是的，蕭伯訥是一位幽默的社會主義家。他爲了要猜一猜社會主義的神秘之謎，曾經不顧一切地訪問過蘇聯，他的親友唯恐他給「赤色的惡魔。餓死凍死了，替他預備了大量的麫包和行帳、但他拒絶了這些餽贈、終於由恐慌的洪水世界進到了另外一個新的天地。在盛大的歡迎聲中，這位大文豪目擊耳聞了一切，才恍然悟到無聊的誣蔑造謠是足以蔽塞世人的聰明的。於是在他回國後，他將在蘇聯所得的印象照實寫出來了。　　中國是一向在侵略的强盜們的肆意侮辱誣謗中過日子的一個可憐民族。「野蠻民族」「未開化的國家」是一切帝國主義者加給我們的惡名。現在我們的大文豪出要不顧一切地來訪問一下中國，看看中國究竟是怎樣的一個民族，看看所謂「文明人」在中國幹的一些什麽勾當。　　可惜蕭伯訥先生和他的夫人來上海的時候，正是冬寒乍退的初春，如果是在萬樹落葉的秋天，我們倒可以用一句唐詩來歡迎他們了：　　無邊落葉蕭蕭下，不盡長江滾滾來！（註）註：在那深秋萬樹落葉無邊的當兒，我們的蕭先生和蕭夫人，笑［容可掬地下了英后輪船，踏上了中國的境地，而滾滾的長江在與歡迎者盛大的歡笑聲相應和？飛游長城  慧珠　　「飛游長城」，是一種多麽壯的快事！　　蕭伯訥在離開英國以前曾經說過：「赴華後，將飛游長城。」　　但是爲預料所不及！一月三日榆關失守，關山淪陷！渴望的東方歷史文化上偉大壯觀的天下第一關，第一關的匾額，却已經送到東京去陳列！　　「事與願違！」失望之至！不敢再作豪想！　　事實逈乎在逆料之外！一夜間瀋陽陷落，一月間敗退錦州：榆關失守，平津已朝不保夕！或者因「戰略關係」會退守到黃河以南！　　但是旣到了東方，多少總有一線希望，「不願華北戰事阻我行也，」姑且游一趟北平，瞻仰瞻仰東方的文化城！　　公宴歡迎，似乎都是請他演說的交換條件。　　「以導游長城爲報。」聰敏之至，到是投其所好的。祗惜這話說得不是時候。日本人已明明佔據了山海關！九門口還烛一部份忠甬將士効死的彊塲！雖則說長城旣稱爲萬里，正不必計較着榆關的一隅！章遏雲的成功  梅花館主　　丨從立志堅决四字得來丨　　章遏雲是個與舊劇不緣的人，自從十一二歲到現在差不多没一天不沉醉於歌臺舞榭檀板管絃之中，一方面研侒人家的戰和做，一方面還在家　請了先生不斷地用功夫，迷戲迷到像這位女士，亦總算是難得的了。伊在這過程之中，曾經做過一次關闊人家的姨太太，雖然生活很舒服，但是因爲不能天天學戲唱戲的原故，深覺不合意趣。結果情願離開了錦衣玉食的闊家庭，依然去幹伊飄泊無定的優伶生活，像伊這種毅力和决心，誠然使人傾服。章遏雲屢屢對人說：「我迷戲迷了十幾年，如果不在上海登過一次臺，决不終止我的努力和奮鬥。」現在伊居然　到目的了，而且所得到的口碑又是很好，古人有「有志竟成」之語，像章遏雲的成功，確然從「立志堅决」四字得來。可知一個人做事，不論大小貴賤，只要肯抱定宗旨，下决心去做，决没有不成功的道理。小說靑春之火  顧明道　　有一個黃昏凱君和他的母親方纔入睡，忽聽得嚶嚶啜泣之聲，斷斷續續的送來。凱君聽着如聞午夜鵑啼，心中陡然起了一種不可思議的感觸。他母親歎道：「這是菊韵的聲音啊！莫不是伊想起了亡夫，又在那裏悲泣了！」他們的房間和伊的較近，所以聽得甚爲清晰，二人便覺得睡不成眼了。母子二人便隔牀談起伊可憐的情景，幸而不久這啜泣聲就停止了。　　明天凱君的母親見了伊，就向伊詢問，是什麽一回事。伊眼圈兒一紅，便將這事的原由告訴我們知曉：原來伊很愛裝飾，雖是做了獨身的孀婦，衣服仍穿得入時，臉上時常敷脂粉，有時出去將一頭雲髮燙得蜷曲，身上洒着一種甜香的香水，所以伊的家人背後竊竊議論伊的不是，說伊不該如此妝飾得花一般的，去向誰送媚呢？頭上若不挿一白花，誰知道伊有孝服在身？誰知道伊是一個不祥的孀婦呢？伊的婆婆又說伊脚氣不好，進門不到三年，便把丈夫害·害字還是個疑問丨死了。他聽得這種不入耳之言，便和伊的小姑發生一番衝突，回到房裏，想想愈覺悲傷，止不住哭了。凱君母子聽了伊一番的訴說，也不由非常慨嘆。　　這樣外面漸漸有些流言了，凱君的母親和凱君談起了伊，也似乎以爲伊旣做了未亡人，是不該瑞像這樣的妝飾靚麗了。雖然流言不可盡信，然而也是咎由自取。凱君暗想女子的貞操問題果眞和裝飾有關麽？這也未可一筆抺煞。本來像伊如此年輕，所處的環境又是十分可憐，若必欲强迫伊吟那柏舟之詩，古井不波的過伊一生，也是一件靠不住的事情。不過伊的前途固是可慮，而伊的自處和所抱的宗旨，伊自已却不可不審愼的。有一天，凱君正坐在寫字檯前，寫一篇關於時事的短評，凱君的母親也坐在一旁做針線；這個時候，菊韵走了進來。伊穿着一件淡綠色布白邊滾的旗袍，踏着一雙漆皮革履，雖是縞素，而很入時。（二）　　事實成了幻想，遺憾與失望能使蕭伯訥氏多添一種新感想：「長城於中國有何用乎？」刦灰中之  林琴南遺譯鄭遵梅　　丨一百　萬言之大犧牲丨　　走過棋盤街商務印書館，就瞧見櫥窗裏陳列着東方圖書館的　型。一個日兵擎着槍桿，惡很很的肆其摧殘、手段。那　多麽驚心觸目啊！　　東方圖書館的被燃，確是一種非金錢所可勝計的文化損失。館中所藏的書，凡三十餘萬册·圖表照片五千餘種。更名貴的·如宋元明善本的各省府廳州縣志，并公元十五世紀前所印的西洋書籍Incunadala若干卷，遠東唯一孤本德國李比希化學雜誌初版全套，香港久已絶版的中國彙報，羅馬敎皇凡的康宮所藏明末唐王的太后王后王太子及其司禮監术監　依天主敎上敎皇書的影片等，完全在犧牲之中。琴南翁晚年因新舊之爭，他老人家憤而辭去大學敎授不幹，一意的　譯西洋說部。一編脫稿，即郵寄商務印書館，除把潤資自給外，且以周䘏那些貧困的族人。商務印書館先後刋印，有林譯說部叢書之目。琴南翁歸道山，積稿未及鉛槧的，統通存庋在涵芬樓中。涵芬樓歸併東方圖書館，正擬整理刋佈，不料那日宼的琉璜彈，竟把他老人家的心血結晶，成爲一堆灰燼。想老人家九京有知，定必爲之太息痛哭哩！　　據聞被燬的遺譯，計一十六種，共九十册，約一百二十萬言。茲將書名披露在下：孝女履霜記，五丁開山記，雨血風毛錄，黃金鑄美錄，囗囗，（未定名哈葛德原著陳家麟合譯）洞冥記續編，情橋恨水錄，神窩，奴星叙傳，（又續編）金縷衣，軍前瑣話，情幻，學生風月鑑，眇郎喋血錄，夏馬城炸鬼，鳳藻皇后小記。　　唉！這是我們小說界所受的大打擊。寫出來，告訴一班愛讀林譯小說的朋友們。上海夜話  張若夻古希臘酒屋　　白天做完了八小時的工作，在黃昏時分，和兩個同伴，在霞飛路上優間地散步，從勞苦忙碌中抽出一部分時間，使身體和心神方面得到一種户外的運動，這是爲在都會中過着漩渦般高速度生活的人們，所應當享受的一種權利。　　散步感到疲倦的時候，我們三個靠賣文爲生的同伴，已經走到杜美路相近。在路旁一座像汽車間式的矮屋前，我們給一塊寫着土耳其式飯店君士坦丁一的招牌吸引住了，三個人一同走到衷而，小夎片刻，喝了三杯濃烈黑色的土耳其咖啡。　　半小時後，我們在隔壁一家「金魚」飯店中，檯子，吃俄國沙皇御用的小牛肉，和世界有名的鮑爾血菜湯，幾方黑麵包片，已經把我們容量有限的胃口塞滿了。　　小小的櫃橡麥面，站着一個丰韻猶存的俄國少婦，身體包在一幅厚呢的披巾裏，眼睛常望着玻璃門外的行人道；旁邊是一個面容蒼白的少女，像歌劇婆漢迷中賢花女迷迷典型的姑娘，身體孱弱，有肺病第二期的現象。　　彼此言語不通，祇好相視默默無語。　　一隻小爐裏，發出燒紅的火光，映在少女蒼白的臉上，覺得有一層温暖的春意。　　走出「金魚缸」的時候，雨雪紛飛，同伴中的一人，看見了路上的雪，他回憶着那歐羅巴洲天花園的瑞士白山，又想到茵夢湖畔一個愛嬌的日内瓦村姑來了。他不禁輕輕嘆了一口氣，滾露出一種淡淡的感傷神情。　　「我們去喝杯酒，借一點酒情的力量，增加我們的勇氣吧，」　　聖母院路有一家東方酒屋，這是專門招待獨身漢的一家酒屋。在一間狹溢的屋子裏，放了六七隻只可坐三人的小方檯子，四壁是不生翅膀的小天使；靠屋頂天花板的壁篬上，畫着古希臘風味的圖案裝飾畫，一個大肚皮的老闆，立在陳列着各色各樣玻璃酒瓶的櫃檯裏。　　一推進門，大肚皮老闆滿面笑容，過來和我们握手道晚安，他是我的一個友人之妻的舊房東，我認識他，他也還認識我，這是一個流亡東方多年的羅馬尼亞國人，他是最合宜於開設酒屋的商人，因爲他的姓名便呌做「酒花園」吓　老闆娘娘和老闆同樣地以胖，伊會說五國的言語，他們有一個女兒，本年不見，已經是亭亭玉立的少女了。女兒容貌生得還差强人意，可惜伊是一圙聰敏面孔笨肚腸的女人，體格很壯健，不過伊一雙大眼睛看起人來，常帶着遲鈍的表情。　　我們面前，放了三杯碧綠的檸伏特加，老闆表示熱誠的招待，送了一盞中國的土產花生米，當做下酒物，我們都是不善飲酒的人，但經不住那老闆慇勤的招待，我們豪興勃發，當我們喝着這種俄國船夫嗜飲的伏特加白乾燒的時候，我們覺得全身起了一種温暖的熱氣。我们並不作鯨魚般的狂飲，只是一口口啜飲，全身的神經都起了緊張的作用，我們興奮極了。　　鋼琴上面放着一府無線電收音機，送出一陣陣優美的音樂。左右鄰座，都是穿着制服的獨身軍人：有靑黃呢的英國陸軍，有打領結的美國小爺兵，有戴紅絨結白布帽的法國水手，有穿花襪短裙的蘇格蘭軍人，笑語一屋，是一個國際軍人的俱樂部！　　我們醉了，彷彿置身於古希臘的酒神之國。放量痛飲的伙伴。我們只要求人類與人類的親善和友愛，頭上飛來了無情的炸彈，脚下發生了大地的震動，我們全都不害怕，我們只怕我們懦怯的敵人躱在黑暗的角裏偷放毒藥的冷箭</p>

<p>自由談	蕭伯訥專號（下）</p>
<h3>關於蕭伯訥</h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>蕭伯訥在“QuintessenceofIbsenism”一文中論易卜生道：人們盲目地堅持着一些不正確的觀念，（關於宗敎的，政治的，兩性關係的，）並且讓這些觀念左右他們的行動，雖則他們心裏不願；而易卜生的諷剌就是針對了此種矛盾狀態。</p>
<p>我們以爲蕭伯訥也就和易卜生相像。蕭的重要著作都是揭發人們傳統觀念的錯誤，（而這些錯誤的觀念又是統治者用種種手段來維持的，）可是蕭比易卜生更深刻。例如對於傳統的錯誤的「義務」觀念，蕭說道：文明人常用義務這一名詞來掩飾他的行爲的眞正面目。在“ＴhiManofDestiny”一劇中，蕭借了拿破崙的嘴說：「英國人做事總要說出一番大道理來。他心裏要什麽東西了，嘴裏决不肯說他要。······當他要替曼郤斯脫的工業製造品找一個新市塲的時候，他先派些牧師出去宣揚和平的福音。然而土人們傷害了牧師了，於是英國人立刻跳起來拿槍保護基督敎；爲基督敎而戰爭，而征略，而且謝謝天賜，佔領了那新市塲。」在”Ｃandida“和‘Widower’sHouses”等劇中，蕭嘲笑那些嘴上掛著「盡義務」的招牌，而無往不想自私自利的僞善者，眞是一字一鞭。</p>
<p>在以拿破崙爲主角的“TheManofDestiny”一劇，以羅馬大將凱撒爲主角的“CaesarsndCleoptra”一劇中蕭嘲笑着世人的的「英雄崇拜。」在蕭的筆下，「英雄」這東西是非常愗笨的自私自利者。</p>
<p>同時這兩篇歷史劇又是「非戰的。」可是蕭的「非戰」劇本還當以”ArmsandtheMan“及”MajorBarbara“爲最主要。前者揭發商國主義國家的兵士對於戰爭的心理：「這是怕死，所以厮殺！」後者揭發不但飙民機關槍魚雷等等是殺人的利器，而「愛國」「宗敎，」「公道，」「義務，」等等好聽的名詞也是殺人的利器。</p>
<p>許多人認爲“ManandSuperman”一劇中間有蕭的「哲學，」故其價値，乃在其他諸劇之上。誠然。「人及超人」除嘲笑世人的戀愛觀而外，又提出了「哲學「；」丨丨我們人不過是一種實騐品，是介於獸和超人之間的一個環，而戀愛呢，則爲大自然達到目的（到超人）的一種手段罷了。戀愛是一種偉大的「宇宙力CosmicForceo蕭在「人及超人」的前面寫了數萬言的長序，以說明他這哲學。喜歡拿戀愛來當作「哲學」研究的人們很可以讀那劇本和那長序。但是也不要太高興。因爲你若把「人及超人」讀了兩遍，你又要學到蕭老先生或者在那裏嘲笑那些「戀愛哲學家。」</p>
<p>從「五四」以來，我們文壇上常常提到蕭的大名。蕭的著作，也很有幾本譯成中文了。然而對於蕭的研究，還是很少。趁現在這當兒，如果認眞把蕭來研究，未始不是一件好事罷？</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（四）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作宜閑譯</p>
<p>「好呵！」那神說。「這正是我要你問我的事呵。你是聰明的智識女子。我從前有一個名呌約伯的僕人相辯論；然而他眞老它眞愚笨，我得將最可怕的災難淋在他身上，纔能夠激得他訴苦。他的妻敎他咀咒了我然後死；我不怪那可憐的女人；因爲我究竟給了他可怕的　光，雖然我後來也給他完全補償了。當我終於使得他辯論的時候，他自命不凡。然而我却立卽將他的眞相揭穿了。他承認我是勝過他。我巧妙地將他折服了，我老實對你說。」「我不要辯論，」黑女孩子說。「我要知道：如果這世界眞是你造的，那你爲什麽造的這樣壞。」</p>
<p>「壞麽」那能手說。「哦！你挺起身來敎我說明麽！請問你是誰！你可以批評我？難道你自已能夠造更好的世界麽？試試看：就是了。試將牠的小小的一點兒造造看。例如，做一條鯨魚看。你做成了，給牠鼻子上挿一隻鐵鈎，帶到我這裏來。你這可笑的小蟲兒呵，你可明白：我不但造了鯨魚，還造了給他游泳的海洋呢，，那海洋，往下到那無底的深處，往上到天空的頂。你以爲這是容易的，我想。你以爲你自已能夠將這做得更好罷。少女呵，你聽我說；你得將你的自負除掉了纔好。你是連一隻老鼠也造不成的，倒挺起身子來反對造大懶獸的我了。你是連一個池塘也造不成的，倒敢和我這七大洋的創造者談天了。你在五十年裏就要變醜變老而至於死的，至於我的威嚴却要永久繼續下去；現在你彷彿是我的姑母似的責備着我。你以爲你是比神還好罷，可不是麽？你對於這番辯論有什麽話要說呢？」</p>
<h3>紳士階級的蜜蜂</h3>
<p>— 許傑</p>
<p>蕭伯訥是英國紳士社會的一隻蜜蜂，他有剌，他也會釀蜜；不過，他所釀的蜜，却是甜中帶酸的。</p>
<p>英國的紳士是不只一個的；因此，當這個蜜蜂無情的去叮這一個紳士時，另外的紳士們，以爲這並没有叮到他們，於是乎，他們笑了；同時，被他人笑爲被蜜蜂叮了的紳士，也發現那幾位笑他的紳士被這討厭的蜜蜂叮了一口了，於是他也笑了。</p>
<p>但英國的社會，除了一大批的紳士以外，還有許許多多的人們，是没有被列入紳士之林的資格的。在他們的眼中看來，這一批紳士們，好像都患有潔癖一樣，禮服穿得筆挺的，領口，袖口，胸口，都是燙得筆挺的白色的硬領，白色的袖口，白色的襯衫。有一點骯髒的東西，他們連豎起兩個指頭去撮一撮都不高興的。這是何等看不過去的事！現在，他們却親眼看見，這一個蜜蜂，嗡嗡的鑽入紳士們的領口，袖口，以及胸口裏去放剌，使得這一批紳士們没有辦法，使得他們演了許多引人發笑的怪劇；於是乎，這一批非紳士階級的人們，也看得笑了。</p>
<p>這大槪便是蕭伯訥之所以爲蕭伯訥吧。</p>
<h3>蕭伯納的戲劇</h3>
<p>— 趙　量　深　譯</p>
<p>Manly　and　Rickert</p>
<p>英國戲劇的改變無疑的是由於易卜生。易卜生在很早的七十年代就由戈斯(Edmund　Gosse）介紹了進來。在一八七二到一八八○年間，阿齊爾(Wiuiam　Archer)和别的一些人譯過他的一部分戲劇；一八八○年他的戲劇卽已上演他的傀儡家庭的譯本或節本在一八八○到一八九○年間曾經在舞台上每星期常開演兩次。在一八九○和一八九一兩年他的戲劇有五種常川開演。這五種戲劇中最顯著的是羣鬼，因爲這是獨立劇院落成典禮的開塲戲。（時爲一八九一年三月十三日）這劇院六年間都爲了拿新的戲劇形式戲給大衆這唯一的目的而奮鬭。這劇院全靠一個荷蘭人葛雷殷(J·T·Grein）的企圖和勇敢方得發達。</p>
<p>蕭伯納起初是易卜生的崇拜者，他是英國用挪威方法來作爲英國新劇起點的第一人。他的陋巷（一八九二）的上演是新運動有力的開始。要想明白陋巷完全除去了舊的材料與技巧，必須知道下列的提要：</p>
<p>㈠劇中人物都是中等階級。</p>
<p>㈡戀愛是不重要的；問題是地主主義的罪惡。</p>
<p>㈢結構與任何已知的計畫不相合。</p>
<p>㈣討論替代了機械的結構。</p>
<p>㈤不辨别結構和人物的平匀。</p>
<p>㈥人物不是傳統的代表人物，只是蕭伯納先生對於經濟問題觀念的代言者。</p>
<p>㈦堆佈京室和小幕顯然是没有的。</p>
<p>㈧傳統的舞台事業顯然是没有的。</p>
<p>㈨激動情緒的口才以辯論來替代。</p>
<p>㈩石灰光的裝置代以普通人在常態生活中的尋常裝置</p>
<p>篵這開始，蕭伯納就多少作有系統的攻擊，以戲劇爲武器，攻擊同時代的許多大思想家，還多少爲他自已作有系統的宣傳。他熟思的選擇他的攻擊。時常更換，以避重複。按年來讀他的一切戲劇，可以重組他所發展的社會哲學和他對於社會改造的宣傳。</p>
<p>講到文學，蕭伯納的戲劇，除了打破早年戲劇傳統以外，還有别的；這些戲劇的組織有下列四點：</p>
<p>㈠關於這些戲劇的社會目的，不僅應該上演，還應該閱讀；不僅閱讀，還要懂得。因此須洋意有名的蕭伯納的序，有幾種的確序比戲劇本身還長，仍是一樣的有趣。</p>
<p>㈡因爲這些戲劇是供閱讀的，所以舞台指示應該發展到可以剌激讀者的想像，自已構造他的眼睛所不能看見的東西；因此盡量用舞台指示的叙述和描寫，推進到成爲文學新體的地步丨丨「室内」（Ｃloset）戲劇。</p>
<p>㈢不用昔日情緒的自訴和最高點，也不用昔日的分幕法；戲劇可以分爲無論多少幕，只要不太長，不致使觀衆的注意力疲倦。</p>
<p>㈣爲使舞台上的生理動作减少，應該除了盡人皆知，永遠老套的會客室和園景以外，還有視線的焦點。因此，新的甚至奇怪的佈景和道具都發明出來了丨丨例如一九○一年人與超人劇中所用的汽車，你决不能說劇中所用的牙醫生的診室。</p>
<p>蕭伯納作品的當前效果是㈠在材料和方法上，展開一切的可能；㈡鼓勵一羣年輕人學他的樣，打破舊的傳統。</p>
<h3>Ｈallo　Ｓhaw</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>Ｄear　Ｓhaw，你來到上海是爲了甚麽的？</p>
<p>是來記問咱們這次殖民地的奴隷？</p>
<p>是來敬禮黃浦江上你們的大英旗？</p>
<p>是來聽日人殺人的砲聲？</p>
<p>是來贊揚咱們的不抵抗主義？</p>
<p>可是我得告訴你：</p>
<p>上海不是倫敦紐約或巴黎，</p>
<p>更不是列寗格勒赤色的都市，</p>
<p>英美日法各國的旗在天空驕傲地飛，</p>
<p>明白地說出中國只是殖民地，</p>
<p>黃浦江裏的軍艦騰着漆黑的烟，</p>
<p>黃浦江岸的苦力喘着急促的氣，</p>
<p>弱者的血肉支持强者的權威，</p>
<p>上海便是這樣一個次殖民地的都市，</p>
<p>你是否感到這是一齣「Unhappy的戲劇」？</p>
<p>咱再告訴你：</p>
<p>你在香港說的話可眞豈有此理！</p>
<p>靑年人聽了伸舌頭，</p>
<p>老年人聽了說「放屁」，</p>
<p>也許還有人打算對你不客氣。</p>
<p>到了上海你可再不要說慢話，</p>
<p>因爲咱們不不懂幽默的，</p>
<p>而且說話也是不准隨便的，</p>
<p>咱勸你到此就緊閉住嘴，</p>
<p>其實，廢話又何必多說呢？</p>
<p>但，當你回去時，</p>
<p>你得帶回一個好消息！</p>
<p>你只說：</p>
<p>中國是不會無救的，</p>
<p>黃浦江水總有一天會湧起，</p>
<p>洗盡大地的黑暗和權威！</p>
<h3>談蕭伯納（續）</h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>二、蕭伯納的法螺</p>
<p>赫傳態度之長處，可由以下數叚證明。赫理斯挖苦蕭伯納，說蕭一面表示痛恨美國，一面却全盤抄襲美國的廣告宣傳法。</p>
<p>「蕭伯納最初的宣傳也不過是通常的方法。從頭他就喊着，「給我大車與喇叺」，現在大車與喇叺不通行了，他又喊着「給我無線電與銀幕。」在他少時與人辯論時，他懂得附庸風雅，使大家心目中將他與某名人之名聯絡起來。我記得一次在他與海恩門辯論時，他站起來說，「馬克斯主義已經死像羊肉了。」殺死他的是我蕭伯納。」』</p>
<p>於是赫理斯便有以下一叚挖苦的妙文：『他（蕭）最先認識有聲電影的宣傳用途······在這一點，他一生演講的訓練，使他極佔便宜。他模擬莫梭利尼（譯者按：這電影我親眼看過）甚至模擬蕭伯納自身，從此可證明他是極偉大的表演家，就是假冒的極端；然而似乎在他中年作戲劇時所搖旗呐喊反抗的就是假冒。他甚至能批評他扮演手叚的高下，而從有聲電影看見他年已將老了，嘴勢也已漸不像樣了。從此他便改用無線電，這無線電可將他的聲音遠播全球而不引起他個人曲線美的問題。』</p>
<p>讀過英雄與美人（Caesar　and　Cleopatra）一劇的序言的人，都記得蕭伯納曾提出一問題：Beher　then　Shakespeari?（蕭伯納是否比莎士比亞好？）在一八九六年，蕭氏寫一篇莎士、</p>
<p>比亞的劇評（那時倫敦Lyceum戲院正在扮演Cymbiline），他說：「除了荷馬以外，古來没有一個有名的作家，連司各脫在内，像莎士比亞被我這樣看不起，當我以自已的頭腦與他的頭腦比較一下之時。我對於他不耐煩的程度，有時使我覺得不如爽性挖起他的屍身對他投石，因爲我明白知道莎士比亞及崇拜他的一班人所能懂得的，只有這一類的看得的侮辱。」</p>
<p>但是記得蕭伯納又在那裏說過「他是，世界上最没有得充分登廣告的人。」這便是蕭氏法螺之一斑。（未完）</p>

<h3>個人的八大宏願</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>現在中國已到了大家賭咒的時候，不僅在會塲上必賭咒，就是個人也似乎　賭咒一番。咒之大小大拘，只求其發之誠心，因爲心誠則靈故也</p>
<p>的確，目下正是兵慌馬亂，上下驚惶，而眞命天子一時又不得出世，剛剛有了天地人三皇造好了神牛鑾駕，却又不幸給不順天時的韓主席一網打盡而又「一笑釋之」像這樣下去，當然不是了局，所以天下興亡，匹夫有責，罪業深重的我輩衆生，不趁此時發願賭咒，更待何時？於是我就有了八大宏願。　　（一）願將學校都改爲舞塲，旣然有了義勇軍，也就不得不設法募捐援助，而募捐之法，又只有跳舞才有奇效，眼見原有舞塲不敷應用，所以願將學校改築，因爲讀盡救國，到現在並不曾顯出意想不到之效力。</p>
<p>（二）願國人皆成藝術家，然而藝術救國，其功效亦不在跳舞之下，可惜中國的藝術家還嫌太少，最好國人皆是藝術家，作者，鑑賞者，比比皆是，於是中國自然也就得救了。</p>
<p>（三）願衆生皆得着般若波羅密　不過也有好些大師說，中國之將亡，確是由於衆生之罪業深重無疑，所以應當多有幾次功德道塲，讓衆生最後得到般若波羅密。</p>
<p>（四）願國人都有良心　當然良心救國，其效最大，假如國人都有良心，那末國貨市塲，也有利市三倍了。國不救而自得救。</p>
<p>（五）願中國小麥不敷應用　據說，因華麥確是不敷應用，而爲了調濟民食起見，自不能不運澳麥以代之。而且澳麥又價廉物美，所以華麥應當年年荒收。</p>
<p>（六）願年年水災　因爲今年並不修堤，所以美麥也就不肯賒欠，爲了賑濟災民起見，所以應當年年水災，</p>
<p>（七）願稻田皆種嬰粟　旣豐收，反成災，那末。爲了却災起見，應當改種嬰粟，以裕國富財源。</p>
<p>（八）願大學生皆有飛機　有人說，北平大學生所以要「逃考」與「提前放假」，因爲不能每人有一架飛機，善哉斯言，所以我願大學生都不飛機，臨危而後走散，以免被人駡爲「遺臭萬年」。</p>
<p>以上是我的八大宏願，皇天后土，實鑒斯言。</p>

<h3>毒瓦斯（續）</h3>
<p>— 孟復</p>
<p>（二）萊維捷脫　萊維捷脫？（Ｌewisit）亦係芥嗅毒氣的一種，性質亦類似芥嗅毒氣，爲帶暗色的油狀液體，具窒息狀的剌戟嗅味，爲大戰末斯一美國化學家所發明，又名「死露」·</p>
<p>（Ｃ）催淚性及剌激喉鼻性毒物</p>
<p>㈠氣化批克林（Ｃhlorpikrin」此毒物爲一無色之液體，氣化後比定氣重五倍半，年固性甚强，除催淚外尙能致人嘔吐以及剌激鼻與喉之黏膜，</p>
<p>㈡一㷍氯乙酮（Chloreacetphenon）此毒物在常温時呈結昌之固體，能剌激眼部而流淚，然受剌激之眼部，僅須受數分鐘新鮮空氣吹過，即復原狀，警察用之最適宜。</p>
<p>㈢一嗅二甲㷍　此爲無色油狀之液體·氣化後比空氣重六倍，毒性微弱，僅以剌激眼之黏膜而出淚，和上者相似。　　剌激喉鼻性毒物大率多爲固體的砒素化合物，塡充於開花彈中，隨開花彈爆發。能分爲極精細之霧狀，其特徴可使透過不甚完備的防毒面具，令敵人因受剌激不得不除去面具，今略述事下；</p>
<p>㈠二㷍基氣化砷　此毒物常温時爲固體。帶有菲之臭味，空氣中有一萬七千分之一的温度時，一分鐘立即被殺死，雖在一千萬分之一的濃度時，尙能剌激喉鼻之黏膜，類如火燒，令人不得不去成具，并且亦能使人嘔吐。</p>
<p>㈡二㷍基𩇛化砷　毒性略同前者，惟性質更强烈。</p>
<p>㈢二㷍基硇氣化砷　此毒物美國軍隊中稱爲「阿達姆捷脫」(Adamsit），毒性介乎前二者之中間，其餘性狀皆類似。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）中毒性毒物</p>
<p>㈠靑酸（即𩇛）　無色透明而帶有苦扁桃油嗅味的液體，能侵害神經中樞，空氣一立方米突中如有Ｏ·六克此毒氣，亦即於空氣容積中　二千分之一的濃度時，呼吸一分鐘立即死亡，</p>
<p>㈡一氧化炭　吾人時聞的冬天煤暈，即爲此氣體作祟，一氧化炭爲一種無色之氣體，空氣中濃度事　到十分之一，一分鐘亦足以殺人，施庝戰事中，因質地太輕，容易揮發而消失，故不甚重要。</p>
<p>以上種種毒物，有呈即效性，有爲遲效性，即效性例如光生氣及氯化批克林等，遲效性則如芥嗅毒氣等，最利害之毒物，當推光生氣，二光生氣以及芥嗅毒氣。（完）</p>

<p>「女士芳名倒要領敎？」</p>
<p>「咦！不是對儂說過，時機成熟，自然儂會知道。」接着呵了一個欠。</p>

<h3>職業的失業者</h3>
<p>— 玉侖</p>
<p>誰說陸緒綸不是一個典型的大學生？</p>
<p>一百二十四元的學費雜費，他付清了；一張柚木小書桌，一張藤椅，幾件行李，他已運到ＸＸ大學宿舍了。半新不舊的西裝，他也穿上了。眞的，他是大學裏一位新人。</p>
<p>讀書豈不是一種職業？而况大學生又被認爲社會的上流人物？所以大學生豈是一個失業者？</p>
<p>然而陸緒綸是一個失業者。他所以爲大學生，就是因爲失業。</p>
<p>一百二十四元，在某一種大學生的家長看來，簡直不算什麽，只不過要動一動手在支票薄上簽一個字就完了。</p>
<p>「討厭！這樣零碎的數目。替我索性塡上二百元罷！多餘的你拿去用」。</p>
<p>也許那些家長這樣說。</p>
<p>但一百二十四元在陸緒綸的父親是經過三四夜的思量才决定的。</p>
<p>『阿緒的位置很難找了；戰後百業凋零，處處機關都鬧着裁員。没有事情做，天天在家裏，他不是事。化上一百數十元，呌他先讀半年大學罷！也許可以得多些智識。横豎不是要訂合同·一定要讀滿四年的。半年之内，也許可以找到相當的職業。那時，履歷上除塡中學畢業之外，還可增上曾在ＸＸ大學肄業。』</p>
<p>經過這樣透澈的思理後，他便向銀行預支了下月的薪水，替緒綸繳了學費，又復叮嚀的囑咐道：</p>
<p>「我不是想你帶四方帽，不過你現時没有職業，天天閒着，恐怕發生不正當的行爲來。所以暫時使你嘗試大學生的滋味。也許兩個月後，你就要做事情去，丨然而不會的，最早也須半年」。</p>
<p>明知讀半年大學是無益的，所以緒綸並不想去，然而自已又失業，又没這樣大的本領把人家的飯碗奪過來。</p>
<p>「不願意也要願意了」他這樣想着，定了二月六日，就任職業的失業者。</p>

<h3>欠債者應有的態度</h3>
<p>編輯先生；</p>
<p>我是一個小學還未畢過業的人；去年蒙親友薦至一爿五金店内做學徒，今年僥倖的升了賬房之職；自身暫時總算結束了，但是家庭呢！唉！父親的航業一蹶不振，較前更爲惡劣，以致虧空許多；近來又爲了貨欵之事，第一次，原告聲請調解，適父親尙在外埠，故未能到庭，但是近來竟一造判决了，其主文謂「被告應即向原告清償貨觺；假執行之聲請駁回，訴訟費用由被告負擔」等語，又上訴期間在二十日以内，判决書送到家後，但是父親之船又在外埠，我對於法律又是門外漢，所以祇有來請敎　　先和了。</p>
<p>㈠上訴期間過後，無力償清貨欵，依法律將要如何。</p>
<p>㈡假執行之聲請是何意思。</p>
<p>㈢我今年是十九歲。能否有代理父親之權。</p>
<p>以上數條請費神答覆爲感頌撰安　　　　　晚楊諤卿敬上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按；</p>
<p>查商場失敗，事本尋常；不過欠債還錢，旣已虧空，當然負責了理。即使一時拿不出來，也當挺身而出，將全部資產，公開攤還：不足，則　定一個切實可行的整理辦法。求人諒解。語云「捉清茅柴好走路」，庶前途仍有重　旗鼓的餘地。如其一味規避，債主當然着急，結果訴諸於法，終不能容你卸責。而且信譽掃地之後。前途更是一無希望了。令尊的事，在原告申請調解之後，當時雖不在上海，那末應當聲明理由，請求展期。即使不明瞭這種手續，也應當於返申之後，前往商議和解手續。照普通法院成例，受理這種案件，由申請調解，宣告調解不成，正式起訴以至缺席判决，至少要經過四個月以上的時間。那末很有餘地，進行和解。爲何計不出此，一味延宕，以至缺席判决呢？現在案已判决，如其不服，祗可上訴；至上訴其限，雖則規定二十天，但也可聲明理由，請求展期。不過事歸實在，要是自問確是欠人債務的話，那末上訴的結果，不過增加些訟費的負擔而已。還不如放棄上訴，爲償債的準備爲上。至上訴期滿，無力清償：那末原告當然提起請求執行之訴；法院可以立即批准，查封財產。</p>
<p>至「假執行」爲一種法律名詞，意思在案子没有判决之前，原告因爲恐怕被告有藏匿或破壞財產之舉，要求對於被告財產，暫時發封。其所異於執行者，因爲在案子没有判决的時候，日後原案不能成立，當然仍可啓封；而且被告還可要求賠償因此而受到的損失。所以請求假執行時，申請人須提出相當保證金額。至楊君對於他父親經手的事情，當然是「夾手賬」，所以代理一層，實在不妥：不過代進一張申明狀，請求將上訴期展長，是有利的。</p>

<p>黛秋吁了一口長氣道：『我早就同娘說過了，以後訂婚的事不必再來求我的同意，我是什麽人都願意嫁了丨丨無論窮得同呌化子一樣，醜得像活鬼一樣，老得像壽星一樣，我都願意嫁。嫁出去總比在此地好些。』</p>
<p>幼中笑道：『這是賭氣的話，你恨不得早些離開你娘嗎？』</p>
<p>『人那裏捨得離開我娘？如果我娘一輩子守寡，我願意終身不嫁，陪着她終老。』</p>
<p>『那末，你是恨我了！怎麽我才能夠消除你心裏的恨呢？』</p>
<p>黛科苦笑着說：『你與我有什麽相干？你也輪不到我來恨呵』！她說到這裏，聲音已被咽住了。幼中再想說話，若華已外面喊他的名字了。</p>
<p>明天，是夏二房大喜的日子，懸燈結綵，甚是熱鬧，桑阿强特地放工一天，騰出墻門間來，好讓夏府排場。趙家送過聘禮來，珠鑽首飾，應有盡有，親友看了，個個滿意。下午，煤人引着一位西裝美少年來拜見岳母，親友又都嘖嘖稱讚。若華對女壻仔細端詳，更是越看越有趣。</p>
<p>㈩㈡　　你是一個殺人的兇手！</p>
<p>今日的夏府，比仲南辦喪事熱鬧得多！有關係的親屬都到了，只有夏太太的姪兒鄭濟平一人缺席。他心裏有說不出的難過，當然不忍來喝夏小姐的喜酒，若華因上次的事，很不滿意，也不去惦記着他了。</p>
<p>幼中很高興的招待新女壻，並介紹他與黛秋小姐見面。黛秋見了未婚夫，被來賓打趣，窘得她哭了出來。夏大老爺伯東看她這樣羞人答答的姿態，不禁掀髯大笑。</p>
<p>夜宴已罷，新壻欲起身告辭，幼中爲了要聯絡新親的感情起見，堅留着女壻打牌，八圈打罷，來賓早已散盡，祇剩兩個媒人在傍打盹守候。若華又留女壻吃了夜點，才入他回去，新女壻辭别出門，幼中直送到大門口，路上黑暗如漆，媒人陪了新女壻出巷口去上馬車，纔走了十幾步，忽聽得砰的一響槍聲，一個人應聲而倒。霎時人聲擾亂，巷口的車夫取了燈火進來一照，大家都吃了一驚，原來中槍的正是那位新女壻！</p>
<p>兩個媒人：初聞槍聲，回頭就逃；聽得放槍人奔過，嚇得縮作一團，不敢仰視：聽見别人驚呼，走過去一看，在暗淡的燈光裏但見新姑爺倒臥在血泊中，便又嚇得渾身戰抖。四肢無力了。也不知是誰吹了一陣警笛，召了一個剛睡醒的警察進巷來，見出了人命，把他的睡魔也嚇逃了。又是一陣警笛聲，召集三五個巡警帮手來。將黑巷裏的人都看管住了，問明白了情由，再去敲夏府的大門。裁縫司務問清楚了，才敢開門。陪他們進去敲二重門。等幼中趕到外面，新女壻的塊魂兒早出了鬼門關，喝過孟婆湯了。幼中仍命馬車夫將屍首送往醫院，一成派急足到趙家去報信，雨個媒人却被警察看管起來，說他們犯着殺人嫌疑。</p>

About sixty soldiers from the Ninth Division of the Japanese Army and more than two thousand men from the puppet National Salvation Army have been dispatched from Dahu Mountain Jin County and are about to enter Rehe.

<h3>Tang Yulin Telegraphed to Zhu Jiqing's Unit to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Chengde: Tang Yulin's circular telegram reads, "To all newspaper offices, since the fall of the Northeast, patriotic people have considered Rehe as a base to resist Japan. Committee Member Zhu Jiqing also came to the border of Rehe early to advocate national salvation. In recent months, according to reports from the front, Committee Member Zhu Jiqing is currently stationed in Xiaojia Dian, Rehe, with only over a hundred men under his command. Zhu personally trains them, preparing to resist Japan. There is currently no action. Because the relationship with the local people is not good, it is feared that it may cause inconvenience. The provincial government has already telegraphed its subordinates to provide proper protection in order to respect patriotic people. However, Committee Member Zhu's actions in Rehe may be far from the truth, so this telegram is issued to inform the people of the country, hoping that it will be published in newspapers to clarify the truth. Tang Yulin." (15th) Printed, (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Garrison in Qinhuangdao Investigates Missing Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Linyu: The Japanese garrison in Qinhuangdao sent a letter to our army stating that two Japanese residents living north of the railway in Qinhuangdao have been missing since the Yuguan Incident and requested a responsible investigation. After our thorough investigation, there was no such incident. We have replied firmly. It has been verified that before the incident on the night of January 2, Japanese residents north of the railway in Qinhuangdao were ordered by the Japanese side to retreat south of the railway and receive protection from the Japanese barracks. The situation in the north has not been restored to this day. What the Japanese side is claiming today is truly beyond reason. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Publishes Letter to Soldiers at the Front</h3>
<p>Financial Arrangements for North China Largely Agreed Upon</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Ziwen is encouraging the soldiers at the front and plans to publish the full text of a letter to the soldiers at the front within a few days, which is currently being printed. The main idea is to wash away the humiliation of the three words "Manchukuo" with hot blood, fight for freedom and courage, inspire weak nations, rise up together, and resist the powerful. All sacrifices have the entire nation as a backing. Our entire nation is a whole, sharing life and death. Do not believe the enemy's deceitful alienation, etc. (17th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Overview of Japanese Military Deployment in Jilin Province</h3>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Outside Jiukoukou the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Japanese Cavalry and Infantry Attacked Changlingzi</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Attacked the Enemy's Rear from Baimaoshan</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting for Six Hours, the Enemy Retreated to Lijia Fort</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qindao Telegram: At 10 PM last night, the Japanese mobilized about 300 cavalry and five tanks from Wanjia Tun, covering their infantry of about 500, and attacked Changlingzi east of Jiukoukou. The fighting was very fierce. A certain unit of ours bravely resisted. At the same time, the volunteer army attacked the rear of the Japanese army from Baimaoshan. The two sides fought fiercely for about six hours. Until 4 AM this morning, the Japanese army retreated and is currently awaiting reinforcements in Lijia Fort.

Japanese aircraft flew to our rear yesterday to scout. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 16th, the Miyake unit of the enemy army at Jiukoukou, with cavalry and artillery, launched an attack on our position from places such as Lijia Fort. The volunteer army led by Zheng Guilin engaged them. At midnight, Han Yunpei's volunteer army also arrived from Lingyuan with over a thousand men and joined the battle. A part of the troops circled to the rear of the enemy army and launched a pincer attack. The enemy army was in great disarray, suffering over a hundred casualties. The volunteer army took advantage of the victory to pursue and fought fiercely all night near Jiukoukou. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Bi, the company commander who was wounded in the previous battle of Yuguan, was treated in the garrison hospital. He was promoted to battalion commander by the Military Affairs Commission. Now that he has recovered from his injuries, he led over a hundred officers and soldiers out of the hospital this morning to continue fighting the enemy at the front. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's Emergency Cabinet Meeting Decides to Reject League of Nations Recommendations</h3>
<p>A statement will be issued at the General Assembly to cast a dissenting vote. Matsuoka will temporarily stay in Europe to await the situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese News Agency Releases Air of Withdrawal from the League of Nations, Then Retracts It</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the report of the Committee of Nineteen will likely be passed at the League of Nations General Assembly next week. It is heard that the Japanese side strongly opposes the report and will first withdraw the delegation attending the League of Nations meeting. After Matsuoka and his party return home, they will consider the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations. According to observations from diplomatic circles, Japan's publicized issue of withdrawal still contains a threatening effect. Even if the Japanese side does declare withdrawal, the report of the Committee of Nineteen will still be valid after being passed by the General Assembly. This is because, according to the League of Nations Covenant, member states wishing to withdraw from the League of Nations must notify the League of Nations in advance. Within the two years of declaring withdrawal, they must still fulfill their international obligations and the duties under the Covenant. Moreover, the current report stipulates that it can take effect without the consent of the parties involved. Therefore, if Japan truly withdraws from the League of Nations, it cannot prevent the implementation of the report. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, the Japanese Cabinet held an emergency meeting. It is heard that the following resolutions have been made regarding the League of Nations' recommendations and report: (1) Reject the League of Nations' recommendations. (2) Maintain Japan's attitude adopted in the written opinion on the Lytton Report, especially not abandoning the two points of recognizing "Manchukuo" and direct negotiations with China without external interference. (3) If the League of Nations General Assembly passes the recommendations, Japan will issue a response based on Section 5 of Article 15 of the Covenant. (4) The Japanese representatives will vote against the report. If the League of Nations General Assembly passes this report, Japanese representative Matsuoka will withdraw to London or Paris and await future developments. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Report Was Published Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Negotiation Committee Will Be Formed After the General Assembly Passes It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations report was officially published at 5 PM on the 17th and broadcast to the world. We are now waiting for the General Assembly to open on the 21st, which will formally declare the failure of mediation, and the report will be passed at the meeting on the 24th. The government is generally satisfied with the report, but there are still a few points that have been instructed the delegation to propose amendments, but they are not very important. After the General Assembly passes the report, it will proceed to form a negotiation committee to report the progress of the negotiations to the General Assembly within three months. (17th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The 19-member Special Committee report, 15,000 words long, will be broadcast at 2 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) today on the League of Nations radio station in two transmissions, one at 75 words per minute and one at 25 words per minute. (7th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Committee of Nineteen's report was released at 3 PM this afternoon. The report is in book form, with very dense text, totaling 27 pages. Each page contains statements that directly or indirectly criticize Japan's actions since September 18th. This report can be seen as proof of the victory of the Lytton Report, as the first paragraph of this report has already included the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report in writing and cited the ten principles of Chapter Nine of the Lytton Report as a compass for the negotiation committee. The concluding remarks and recommendations have been telegraphed in detail. The historical part describes past events and the efforts of the League of Nations in great detail, with citations of resolutions and provisions of the three major conventions as necessary bases for resolving disputes. Finally, it describes the Secretary-General Drummond's contact with China and Japan and reiterates the resolution of December. The Secretary-General's letter to Japan on February 14th has also been included in the report. This letter rejects Japan's attitude towards "Manchukuo" and attaches a warning that if the current situation becomes more serious, it will make new efforts at mediation even more difficult to initiate.

<p>Tokyo Translation Released</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has scheduled to release the translated version of the League of Nations' proposed solution to the Manchuria issue tonight. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations General Assembly Will Convene on the 21st</h3>
<p>Notification Has Been Issued</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open at 3:30 PM on the 21st (10:30 PM Shanghai time). It is heard that Xi Meng is scheduled to arrive in Geneva on the 19th. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat decided to hold the General Assembly at 3:30 PM on the 21st to review the report adopted by the Committee of Nineteen. The Secretariat notified the delegations of various countries on the evening of the 16th. (17th Japan United News Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The agenda for the League of Nations General Assembly meeting on Tuesday includes the Sino-Japanese conflict as the first item and the resignation of Director Huber of the Nansen International Refugee Relief Bureau and the election of a successor as the second item. The second item takes very little time and will likely be handled first during the meeting, so that the audience can concentrate on the Far East issue. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Carefully Considers Measures to Cope with League of Nations Countermeasures, According to Japanese News Agency</h3>
<p>Prematurely Releasing Atmosphere of Deciding to Withdraw</p>
<p>But Another Telegram Declares Correction</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government held a temporary Cabinet meeting at 4 PM today to discuss countermeasures against the League of Nations. As a result, it was formally decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. (17th Electric Communication Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Japanese Electric Communication Agency Correction: To whom it may concern, the previous telegram was a false report. The matter of withdrawing from the League of Nations still needs to be discussed at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting. This is to inform you.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese temporary emergency Cabinet meeting was held today at 4:45 PM under tense atmosphere. Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Uchida, Army Minister Araki, Navy Minister Osumi, Finance Minister Takahashi, and all other cabinet members attended. First, Foreign Minister Uchida distributed printed publications from Part One to Part Four of the Committee of Nineteen's Recommendation and reported in detail on the League of Nations' proceedings and the attitudes of various countries' governments towards the League of Nations. Then, they entered into deliberations, during which Navy Minister Osumi, Education Minister Hatoyama, and Commerce Minister Nakajima raised detailed questions regarding diplomacy. Finally, Army Minister Araki specifically explained the military situation in Rehe and the strategies that Japan should adopt. The deliberation lasted for two hours and fifteen minutes, and the meeting adjourned at 7 PM. Because of the seriousness of the situation, it will continue tomorrow. It is expected that after a formal decision is made, a meeting of senior statesmen will be held separately for careful discussion before an announcement is made.</p>
<p>Another report states that after the temporary Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Saito, Navy Minister Osumi, and Foreign Minister Uchida continued to stay at the Prime Minister's official residence to discuss all strategies after withdrawing from the League of Nations and whether to withdraw the disarmament representatives at the same time. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fundamental reasons why the Japanese government has abandoned the League of Nations and finally decided to withdraw are as follows: (1) The current League of Nations, which is merely a simple organization between countries, has taken on the attitude of a supranational arbitration institution, which is a complete distortion and cannot be tolerated. (2) The League of Nations is a mixture of Wilson's original mutual guarantee and Clemenceau's principle of balance of power, based on an unjust distribution of territory and ignoring the principle of racial equality. From the beginning, it had the view of European League of Nations. Japan only participated out of respect for the spirit of peace. (3) The scope of the League of Nations' political capabilities is limited to local European affairs. It is natural to return it to the European League of Nations. (4) Because the United States and Russia, which have close ties to the Far East issue with Japan, have not joined, Japan's participation alone is ineffective. (5) The League of Nations Covenant is incomplete and not thorough. There are no clear provisions regarding the exercise of the right of self-defense and boycotts. There are no provisions for applying the Monroe Doctrine to the Far East, which has special circumstances similar to the United States. Japan believes that there is no need to remain in the League of Nations. (17th Electric Communication Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Geneva Scenes</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The situation of Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations now seems to be increasingly obvious. This is naturally lamented by the general public, but the attitudes of various countries towards this outcome in the Sino-Japanese dispute are quite inconsistent.</p>
<h3>Small Countries Rejoice at Japan's Withdrawal</h3>
<p>All the small countries unanimously chant the high-sounding tune of actively applying the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. Now, regarding Japan's withdrawal, they naturally regard it as a great victory. The small countries hold this attitude not because they are motivated by hostility towards Japan or friendship towards China, but their main desire is to make the League of Nations Covenant a true tool for mandatory resolution of disputes. The South American countries have no direct involvement in this Far East dispute, but they want the League of Nations to have the power to force belligerent countries to accept its judgment.</p>
<h3>The Concept of Justice Greatly Enhances Reputation</h3>
<p>Ireland's actions are also fair and selfless, with no personal interests involved. Although some parties believe that Representative Lester of the South Irish Free State is engaging in personal activities, there is now reason to believe that the instructions he has received are more advanced than what he has already done. Representatives Pinnis of Czechoslovakia, Motta of Switzerland, Madariaga of Spain, and Unden of Sweden all want to see the League of Nations have real power in international politics and be a guarantee for small countries to resist the aggression of powerful neighbors. This is why they are doing their best to issue a judgment on Japan for sending troops to occupy Chinese territory. What they are worried about is that the same situation may occur in Europe in the future, so they are now working hard to overturn this precedent.</p>
<h3>French Policy Upholds the Covenant</h3>
<p>French policy has recently changed greatly, and the reason for this is that it wants to consolidate the League of Nations Covenant and feels that this change is beneficial to itself. Although France may not approve of sanctions, its attitude will tend towards the policy of upholding the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<h3>Poland Observes from the Sidelines, Russia Takes a Strict Stance</h3>
<p>Poland has no major interests in the Far East and has always maintained a spectator attitude. But the most surprising thing is the attitude of Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia has taken the opportunity to criticize Japan's policy in Manchuria. This can be seen in the definition of aggressor announced by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov at the Disarmament Conference. Germany has shown a tendency to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, but its internal situation is currently chaotic and unstable, so no matter how the situation changes in the future, Germany may not have any important actions.</p>
<h3>US Entry into the League of Nations Will Eventually Be Realized</h3>
<p>There is one more thing that makes many League of Nations member states not feel too worried about Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, because they feel that there is now a greater possibility that the United States will be drawn into the League of Nations' scope. Some parties predict that the United States will have joined the League of Nations before 1935.</p>
<h3>Even if Japan Withdraws, It Will Still Be Restrained</h3>
<p>Although, judging from the current phenomenon, Japan will leave Geneva at the end of next week, Japan cannot withdraw from the League of Nations without giving two years' notice in advance under Article 1 of the Covenant. Therefore, for at least the next two years, Japan will still be a member of the League of Nations and a director of the Executive Council. Although Representative Matsuoka's departure is a shocking demonstration, it cannot actually change the situation in the near future. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Araki Rants Again</h3>
<p>Premeditated Policy to Invade Rehe</p>
<p>Rejecting External Interference</p>
<p>The Military Strongly Advocates a Hardline Stance Towards the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Araki, because of the rampant rumors across the country in recent days, the stock market plummeting, and financial circles in turmoil, gave a talk to the press this morning to reassure the public, saying that since the Committee of Nineteen's recommendation was published, the people seem to be worried about the country's future. In fact, this is just unnecessary anxiety. Our Japanese government is determined to implement its established policy, and no force can interfere with our national policy. The military invasion of Rehe is an imminent issue, and the military and "Manchukuo" have coordinated to implement it in the near future. There is no need to reconsider the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations. We can withdraw at any time. As for how to deal with the situation after withdrawal, we have made full preparations to deal with any interference or infringement. (17th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, all the newspapers published Army Minister Araki's remarks to the press last night regarding Rehe and the League of Nations' recommendations. It is said that the Japanese government has not yet made a final decision, but Japan will inevitably have to withdraw from the League of Nations because the recommendations are completely contrary to Japan's established policies of recognizing "Manchukuo," direct negotiations with China, and stationing troops in Manchuria. As for Japan's position on Rehe, it is recognized that Rehe is an internal matter of "Manchukuo" and has nothing to do with the League of Nations or anyone else. Military action against Rehe may break out in the near future. The Asahi Shimbun carried a report from Changchun this morning stating that "Manchukuo" will soon publish an article stating that it does not want to extend the war in Rehe south of the Great Wall unless China forces it to do so. If necessary, the war zone is expanded, the responsible party should be China. It was reported in the newspapers this morning that a Cabinet meeting would be held today to consider the League of Nations' recommendations. According to a report in the Yomiuri Shimbun, the Cabinet will hold a two-day meeting, discussing the issue of withdrawing from the League of Nations today and deciding on the Rehe issue tomorrow.

<p>(Tokyo) Senior officials from the Army Ministry's General Staff Headquarters and other departments gathered at the Army Ministry to discuss countermeasures against the League of Nations and listened to the opinions of Colonel Honma, an expert on Europe, who said that the application of Article 16 after withdrawing from the League of Nations, i.e., military pressure and economic blockade, is easy to say but difficult to implement. Even if it is implemented, only the financial industry may show signs of decline due to the depreciation of exchange rates, so there is no need to worry. Also, the islands under the South Pacific Mandate should actually and legally be managed by Japan. The opinions of all were also consistent. However, whether the full powers of disarmament should be withdrawn or reduced as a natural consequence of withdrawal was also discussed. Some said that if all of them were withdrawn, the League of Nations might take advantage of it. Therefore, after careful discussion, it was decided that the full powers of disarmament would not be withdrawn for the time being, but would be determined as the opportunity arises.

<h3>U.S. Officials Worried About War Brewing in the Far East</h3>
<p>If the 19th Route Army's Spirit of Resistance is Emulated</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War is Bound to Expand to North China</p>
<p>Japan Might Blockade China</p>
<p>(Washington) According to observations from official circles, the current situation in the Far East is the most serious since the September 18th Incident. The results of studies by the Army and Navy today suggest that the situation in Jehol could prompt the Japanese military to blockade the Chinese coast, which is not impossible. If the Chinese troops in Jehol can emulate the efforts of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai to resist Japan, the war will inevitably extend to areas south of the Great Wall. Formal declaration of war between China and Japan will then be unavoidable. If events evolve to the point of a declaration of war, the Japanese military will blockade Chinese ports as a second step. These opinions, though speculations from those closely monitoring the development of the Far Eastern situation, sufficiently demonstrate the serious concern of American figures regarding the situation in the Far East. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Observing the United States' Policy Toward Japan During the Direct Conflict Between Japan and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Washington - The American government and public are extraordinarily interested in the development of the Sino-Japanese issue in Geneva, paying close attention to how the League of Nations will ultimately deal with Japan. General opinion believes that once the Manchurian issue leaves the hands of the League of Nations, it will immediately develop into a serious issue between the United States and Japan. Therefore, there is much speculation about the policy of the next president, Roosevelt. However, Roosevelt does not seem to have a definite policy at present and will need to shift depending on the development of the situation. A common observation about the American attitude is that, whether the United States attempts to develop its market in the East through Japan or attempts to overwhelm Japan at the cost of war to realize its Eastern policy, it must first determine the fundamental principles of its policy. How the next President Roosevelt will determine these principles is a major question, but it will undoubtedly depend on the economic situation of the United States. If the United States in 1933 can achieve the prosperity it had during the Washington Conference in 1922, it can be predicted that American diplomacy and military preparations will become a major threat to Japan's Far Eastern policy. From this point of view, it can be seen that the United States' policy toward Japan depends on the administrative ability of the Roosevelt government, and people generally hope that this new government will have the ability to adjust the economic downturn and achieve the desired prosperity.

<h3>Simon Claims the Door to Mediation is Not Closed</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons today that the possibility of mediation still exists before the League of Nations Assembly passes the report of the Committee of Nineteen. He knows the draft report will be published tomorrow, and the League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to meet on Tuesday, February 21, to consider this report. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) News from Peiping that Japan will send an ultimatum to China is a matter of inquiry in official and public circles today. Liberal Party MP Mr. Maben asked whether it was accurate that Japan had issued an ultimatum to China over the Jehol affair. The British Foreign Secretary responded that he had not seen a report that an ultimatum had been issued, but he heard that the secretary of the Japanese embassy in Peiping had told reporters on Tuesday that Japan intended to issue an ultimatum. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Our Delegation Issues a Jehol Crisis Communiqué</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations issued a communiqué stating that Japan is rapidly preparing to attack Jehol, and its troops are building solid defensive lines in the Shanhaiguan and Jiukou areas. The Japanese troops stationed there have not withdrawn. All information transmitted by the Japanese side is false. The spokesperson for the Chinese delegation said that British Foreign Secretary Simon's declaration in the House of Commons on February 13 that the situation was calm and that part of the Japanese troops had withdrawn was a result of mistakenly listening to Japanese rumors.

<h3>Su Bingwen's Troops in Russia Begin Returning Home</h3>
<p>Via Xinjiang</p>
<p>(Moscow) The anti-Japanese troops who retreated into Russia with General Su Bingwen two months ago, after being accommodated by the Russian authorities in Tomsk, are now, after consultations between the Chinese and Russian governments, starting to be transported back to China today. The soldiers will depart first, transported by the Siberian Railway to Kyakhta, and then enter Xinjiang. General Su and other officers and their families, because this route is dangerous, will wait until the affairs of the soldiers' return are completed, and then return to China via Europe. It is currently believed here that General Su will likely stay for another three weeks according to the accommodation agreement, and then leave Russia. As for all accommodation and transportation costs, they will be paid by the Chinese government, and Russian officials are currently calculating them. (National News, 17th)</p>

<h3>Northeast Jehol Support Association Established</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen and Others Give Speeches</p>
<p>Ding Wenjiang and Others Elected as Directors</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Northeast Jehol Support Association held its inaugural meeting at the Foreign Affairs Building at 4 p.m. on February 16. Over a hundred people attended, including Song Ziwen, Zhang Xueliang, Zhu Qinglan, Zhang Boling, Jiang Menglin, Zhou Zuomin, leaders from all sectors of Peiping and Tianjin, representatives from the Shanghai local association, and representatives from the volunteer army. Zhang Boling presided over the meeting. Huang Yanpei first reported on the preparations, followed by a speech by Song Ziwen, who stated that Japan has occupied the three eastern provinces and is now invading Jehol. Jehol is a barrier to North China and to the entire country, so its position is extremely important. He came to Peiping this time, and Zhang expressed his determination to fight to the death, but resistance to Japan requires great sacrifice, so national unity is essential to succeed. China has already won a moral victory in the League of Nations, and if it can improve itself, ultimate victory will belong to China. Zhang Xueliang then gave a speech, stating that at this critical moment for the country, revival or destruction hinges on this moment. If we can unite against the enemy, it will be an excellent opportunity for revival. If we cannot unite against the enemy, it will be a critical moment for national destruction. Japan's revival was also forced by foreign threats. Today, we should all take responsibility to strengthen ourselves. But self-strengthening is not the responsibility of a few, but the responsibility of the entire nation. He hopes that the people of the country will do three things: (1) stand on the same front, (2) save useful money to support resistance to the enemy, and (3) concentrate individual strength to pursue a consistent goal. Therefore, at this moment, we must first encourage ourselves and then encourage others. As for resisting the enemy, it is everyone's personal responsibility. Zhang Boling then gave a speech, stating that northerners are big but slow, and the same is true of their patriotism. The words of Huang, Song, and Zhang are like giving northerners a shot in the arm. He hopes that even though northerners are slow to act, their spirit should be enduring. Since the government has expressed its determination, the people should make special efforts to overcome national difficulties together. Following this, Mrs. Wang Ziwen and Zhou Zuomin gave speeches, both expressing that the government and the people should work together to resist foreign aggression. Then, the regulations were passed, and Ding Wenjiang, Wang Kemin, Wang Shuhan, Hu Shi, Zhou Qiqian, Zhu Qinglan, Jiang Menglin, Yu Fengzhi, Zhu Chunlin, Zhou Zuomin, Xiong Xiling, Hu Zhengzhi, and 33 others were elected as directors.</p>
<p>They were divided into eight groups for general affairs, finance, special affairs, relief, supplies, transportation, medical affairs, and publicity, and sent telegrams to the government and all sectors of the country, ordering them to resist Japan. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Seeks to Aid Refugees from Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The people of Outer Mongolia who do not adhere to communism fled to Inner Mongolia last winter, gathering in the Ulanqab League, Xilingol League, Ujumchin Banner, and other places, pleading for relief. The Mongolian Affairs Commission sent Li Fenggang with funds to provide relief, and he has arrived at the area, distributing aid separately. In addition, a large number of refugees who recently fled back from Outer Mongolia have arrived in the Mazong Mountain area on the border of Xinjiang and Gansu, numbering about 18,000 to 19,000, each carrying cattle, sheep, tents, and hunting rifles, in a state of extreme distress. Local officials were unable to accommodate them, so the refugees formed teams to rob merchant caravans along transportation routes for a living, causing great disruption to order. Yesterday, the Suiyuan Provincial Government sent a telegram reporting that, according to a telegram from the Xinjiang Provincial Government, the number of refugees was too large, and if relief was not sought urgently, it was feared that transportation in Xinjiang and Gansu and local security would be affected. It is heard that the government is paying close attention to this and has sent Diliwa Hutuktu, who recently fled back from Outer Mongolia, to appease and provide relief. However, because relief funds have not yet been remitted, the officials are staying in Peiping awaiting orders. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Influence of the German Coup on the Eastern Question Is Ominous</h3>
<p>(1) The World at the Beginning of 1933</p>
<p>The world economy remained in a state of panic throughout the past year. General prices and stock and securities prices were particularly low in the summer of last year. There seemed to be a turning point in July. After October, the trend shifted to a slow decline or could be said to be at a standstill. Therefore, optimists believe that the world economic panic has reached its bottom. Credit anxieties about public and private debts have gradually eased. Afterwards, they will rise again. Stockpiles are gradually decreasing. Market transactions are gradually becoming active. The market will inevitably improve day by day. At least, the direction of decline has been reversed and is a symbol of a new market.</p>
<p>However, for this turning point of the new market, first, investment activities must be re-expanded, and capital gains must be higher than before. Second, the market for the sale of goods must be expanded again, and its absorption capacity must be higher than today's production capacity. However, given the current situation, it is difficult to further expand the scope of investment, and there is a lack of hope for increasing capital gains. The first condition for investment activity is a mere dream. The market for the sale of goods is not a new problem that has arisen in recent years. The cause of the European War was the struggle for the market. Dividing colonies was its main factor. Today, the changes in the world can by no means satisfy even one ten-thousandth of current desires. There is absolutely no second New World to discharge surplus products. The purchasing power of cities and villages has not increased in the slightest. How can the general market be expanded? The second expansion of the sales market is also hopeless.</p>
<p>Therefore, the internal competitive antagonism among capitalist countries is extremely fierce. The attempt to expand territory surpasses any theoretical or ideological struggle. The Soviet Union, as a rising nation, has independently created a new system and is moving towards a socialist future, which is a spiritual hindrance to the countries of the world. The saying "Joint Offensive Against the Soviet Union" is also a superficial observation and ignores the seriousness of the conflict of interests among the countries themselves. However, all capitalist countries share the psychology of preventing "communization." Therefore, when Germany's economy was on the verge of bankruptcy and its politics were extremely volatile, Britain and France could not but find ways to reduce, and even completely stop, demanding reparations from Germany. Restrictions on armaments also had to take into consideration Germany's demands to some extent and acknowledge the principle of equality.</p>
<p>After Germany was extremely disillusioned, the National Socialist Party seized the middle class, held future hopes, and jumped onto the political stage to rescue Germany and create a new world order. To abolish the Treaty of Versailles and break all shackles to revive Germany is Hitler's political premise. As for the extent of its practical force today, it is feared that it will still join hands with British and French financial capitalists in secret. Politics will temporarily maintain the status quo. Suppressing communist activities is its urgent task. As for the Weimar Constitution, it still expresses its compliance. As for the change of cabinet in France, it is almost a periodic coup and is very minor in world relations.</p>
<h3>(2) The Concept of the Powers on Japan's Invasion of China</h3>
<p>Since the German regime has passed from the Central Party to the hands of the extreme right, logically Britain and France should express panic and take precautions. Why are they not panicked and not taking precautions? This is because Hitler's cabinet has not fundamentally denied the Treaty of Versailles and has not taken any attacking attitude towards the current system. Therefore, Britain and France can use it to resist the westward advance of the Soviet Union and seek a new balance of capitalism.</p>
<p>However, the credibility of the League of Nations must be strengthened to be able to subdue European countries and be jointly trusted by the world's powers. Only in this way can Germany's grievances be smoothed, the Soviet Union's agitation be prevented, and the balance of power among the great powers be maintained. Unexpectedly, Japan is forcefully advocating monopoly, regardless of everything, relying on military force, from annexing the three northeastern provinces to openly declaring military action in Jehol, directly regarding the League of Nations as nothing and our country's sovereignty as a mere formality. The reason why it is so rampant and dares to risk the disapproval of the world is that the world economic panic has not ended, and how the future will turn is still a question. The world's total production index in the past year (excluding the Soviet Union) fell by 33% compared to 1928. The major countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Germany have all fallen from 11% to 43%. This situation clearly shows that the national strength of various countries has reached its extreme exhaustion. Today's international relations are complex and intricate. International wars must be undertaken with the country's strength to cope with them. At this time, all countries are caught in extreme exhaustion. How can they recklessly start wars? And how dare they lightly start wars?</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan clearly knows that annexing the Northeast is the first step in breaking the international balance of power, and attacking Jehol and disturbing Peiping and Tianjin is an iron hand in destroying world peace. How can the countries tolerate this? However, they must all take into account the decline of their national economies and strive for recovery. They cannot but temporarily relax their stance on Japan's military aggression. This is why the powers have delayed and procrastinated since the Shenyang Incident one year and five months ago.</p>
<p>Since the German coup, the situation in Western Europe has taken a sudden turn, and the Soviet Union's momentum is growing day by day, which cannot but be worried about. If the credibility of the League of Nations is completely lost under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism's invasion of the three northeastern provinces, not only will it be difficult for European countries to achieve a balance and any disputes will be unable to be resolved, but also the Chinese market, which bears the world's temporary hope and is the last opportunity for the capitalist market problem, if it is monopolized by Japan, the future of the world economy will be even more dangerous and the economic crisis of the countries will be even more difficult to resolve. Therefore, the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen has a proposal to restrain Japan and advocate the denial of the puppet state. Even so, if our country cannot exert its own effective strength, even if the League of Nations Assembly resolves to abolish the puppet state, it will at most be equal to a kind of political demonstration by the major powers of the League of Nations against Japan.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement Approaching Expiration</h3>
<p>Our Government Believes There Is No Need to Renew It</p>
<p>Beijing Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting Announcement of Termination</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement signed on May 6 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, with its attached table divided into two parts, Part A containing four clauses, that is, the Chinese government will maintain the tax rates to be levied on Clauses 1 to 3 of Part A within a three-year period from the date the agreement becomes effective, and maintain the tax rates to be levied on Clause 4 of Part A within a one-year period. It is now learned that the special treatment regarding Clause 4 of Part A has long expired and been cancelled, and the provisions for taxation of Clauses 1 to 3 of Part A will also expire on May 16 of this year. It is heard that the government has no intention of renewing the reciprocal provisions. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3>Two Iron Ore Companies in Ma'anshan Sell Iron Sand to Japan</h3>
<p>Limin Company Punished</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports from all sectors of the anti-Japanese association, Limin, Baoxing, and other iron ore companies in Cihu Town, Dangtu County, Anhui Province, have repeatedly collected large quantities of iron sand and supplied them to the enemy for the production of guns and cannons, which are used to kill our compatriots. According to confidential reports, enemy ships have recently gone to the area to load the iron sand. The association requests that measures be taken to stop this. The association has sent letters to the Executive Yuan and the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters to strictly prohibit this. It has also dispatched Ni Guanghe, a member of the standing committee of the association, and Luo Tajing, Ni Huanran, and other staff members to Dangtu to discuss with the Cihu Town Anti-Japanese Association on how to stop this. After arriving at the port, they, together with Zhao Jingxuan, Chen Changming, Tang Chang, Chen Changxiang, Cha Rixian, Song Peiji, Wen Jinsheng, Li Shantong, and other representatives from the Cihu Town Anti-Japanese Association Committee, seriously negotiated with the Limin Company. Unexpectedly, the enemy ship had already left at 8 a.m. They then met with Liu Jietang, the manager of the company, and issued a warning to him, ordering him to guarantee that he would never supply iron sand to the enemy again, and fining him 20,000 ocean dollars, requiring him to remit the funds to the Nanjing Central Bank within one week for the purpose of donating to purchase patriotic aircraft. They also gave him one week to reply. It is reported that the manager of the company has submitted two guarantees on the spot, one to the Capital Anti-Japanese Salvation Association and one to the Cihu Town Anti-Japanese Salvation Association for record-keeping. He has also rushed to Shanghai to ask the board of directors of the company for instructions on how to handle this. The above is the process of negotiation with the Limin Company. As for the Baoxing Company, the representative also went to inquire, but the company has now been closed and there is no one in charge, so there was no way to negotiate. (Special Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Zhang Zongchang's Eldest Son, Zhang Jile, Betrays the Country</h3>
<p>Belonging to the Rebel Army of Cheng Guorui</p>
<p>His Grandmother Sends a Letter Condemning Him</p>
<p>(Peiping) It is heard that Zhang Zongchang's eldest son, Zhang Jile, after going to Dalian with his mother, Madam Yuan, suddenly went to Changchun in January of this year to surrender to the puppet state. Recently, he was appointed by the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Muto Nobuyoshi, to the rebel army of Cheng Guorui as the commander of the 19th detachment, and will soon be transferred to Dahushan to assist the rebels in attacking Jehol. Zhang Zongchang's old mother burst into tears upon hearing this. She has already sent a long letter to her grandson, Jile, condemning him for being unwise and unfilial, destroying his father's ambitions, and ordering him to return to Dalian immediately, study peacefully, and pull back from the brink while it is still not too late. Zhang Jile is only 26 years old. He used to frequent brothels in Peiping and associate with actors Li Wanchun and Zou Jianpei. He is a纨绔子弟 (纨绔子弟 is someone born in luxury and only knows how to indulge himself). This time, he was used by Cheng Guorui to call on the scattered personnel of the old Zhili-Shandong Allied Army.

<h3>The Elite of the Red Bandits Are Nearly Exhausted</h3>
<p>Rumor of Peng Dehuai's Death in Battle</p>
<p>(Nanchang) According to captured bandit reports, the bandits are focusing their efforts on one point, fiercely attacking one of our units. Zhu De and Mao Zedong personally supervised the pseudo 1st, 3rd, and 5th Army Corps, the pseudo 22nd and 10th Armies, besieging Yongfeng from the 10th to the 14th. On the 12th night, Peng Dehuai commanded the 53rd and 2nd Armies on the front lines, charging to seize the city, fighting hand-to-hand. The elite of the bandits were nearly exhausted. Peng was hit by several bullets and died of his injuries after being treated at a pseudo rear hospital. Zhu and Mao, unable to fight any further, retreated in the direction of Xiaoshi, Shigou, and Fenglin City Mountain. The bandits are using Kangdu, on the border of Jianning, Ninghua, Lichuan, Guangchang, and Nanfeng, as their main base. They are transporting wounded bandits and stolen goods through Lichuan, causing congestion on the roads to Guangchang and the northwest of Fujian. The pseudo 21st Army has gathered on the east bank of the Gan River. Several thousand bandits attacked Yongfeng but were repelled by Liu Shaoxian, who relied on city defense fortifications.

The authorities plan to deploy 1,000 experienced police officers to guard the station and surrounding areas, and another large contingent of police to patrol the roads along Roosevelt's motorcade route. The security will be unprecedented, fearing that mentally ill individuals may be incited by Sanggala's assassination attempt to take further unexpected actions.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Talks About the Incident in the Train</h3>
<p>National Telegram, Miami, 16th: US President-elect Roosevelt visited the injured in the hospital again today, and then returned to New York by special train. According to his remarks in the train, "When I first heard the gunshots yesterday, I was as surprised and doubtful as the public, thinking it was firecrackers. At that time, the speech had just ended, and I returned to my seat to talk with Mayor Cermak. Someone happened to bring a telegram to report its contents. I got up and leaned forward, listening to him, when the gunshots suddenly erupted, followed by a rapid succession of shots. The driver was alert and immediately started the car. I saw Mayor Cermak fall under the car, and Mrs. Gill fall a few yards away. I ordered the driver to stop the car. At that time, a detective shouted to the driver to leave the crowd quickly, and the car started again. When I ordered him to stop for the second time, someone had already carried Cermak away. I felt his wrist and realized his pulse had stopped. I was deeply afraid that he would not recover before reaching the hospital. Fortunately, he woke up after a minute. I am now especially concerned about his recovery."</p>
<h3>Condition of the Injured is Good</h3>
<p>Regarding Cermak's condition, he was sleeping more peacefully when Roosevelt visited this morning. The doctor said there was some hope of recovery. Although the injuries to Mrs. Gill, Sonnend, and Mrs. Cruz are severe, they are all expected to recover. The lightly injured Cadwell was mistakenly reported yesterday as a five-year-old child. Now it is known that he is a 22-year-old young man. In addition, it has been learned that there is also a detective, Clark, who was injured. This gentleman was actually the first person injured. The bullet first hit his hand and then penetrated the Chicago Mayor's chest. Seeing that Roosevelt was not injured, and fearing that the target of the assailant was the Mayor, he immediately jumped in front of Cermak, hoping to take the bullet for him. Seeing Cermak seriously injured, he temporarily stayed by his side and continued to protect Roosevelt, not mentioning his own injuries. It is said that although he was in great pain at the time, the injury was not serious. He can be described as loyal to his duty.</p>
<h3>Sangala's Tendency to Kill is Inherent</h3>
<p>As for the assailant Sangala, after being interrogated throughout the night, his statements remain the same. He said he was born in Calabria, Italy, is 33 years old, and apparently brought hatred with him from birth. Therefore, in school, he deeply envied classmates who were better than him. At the age of sixteen, he worked and often fought with the other boys, especially hating officials, always wanting to kill them. He was especially determined to kill all the rich and powerful people in the world, and Roosevelt was one of them. His mood was often troubled, and his desire to kill became even stronger after suffering from stomach pain. He does not belong to any party, and his actions are purely his own will. He likes to read radical literature, especially writings discussing the direct actions of anarchists. As for why he never attempted to assassinate other American officials, Sangala simply claimed that he did not have a good opportunity. Although Sangala spoke frankly and answered all questions, the police are still not satisfied with his confession and deeply suspect that such people would not seek to make acquaintances with comrades. Therefore, they are currently carefully investigating various radical organizations, anticipating that after investigation, they may find that he belongs to some dangerous group, and there are also accomplices.</p>
<p>Reuters, Miami, 16th: Sangala was questioned today by Professor Moray, Roosevelt's economic advisor. He said he has no interest in communism and does not understand the doctrine of anarchism.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 17th: Morgan, the captain of the American detective team, believes that Sangala, the assailant of President Roosevelt, is an anarchist, the same as Korgosweiz, the assailant of President McKinley in 1901.</p>
<h3>The Assassination Case Court Will Open Today</h3>
<p>National Telegrams also stated that, as for Roosevelt's attitude, it is said that he is not angry with the assailant, but is worried that there are people in the country who harbor the desire to harm officials. Roosevelt's friends want to believe that the assailant is definitely mentally ill and that his actions have nothing to do with radical movements. It is now heard that the authorities will charge him with attempted murder and, according to the US Attorney General, while there is a law against defaming the President, there is no article against assassinating the President or President-elect. Therefore, this case will be prosecuted under state law. Also, immigration officials here initially wanted to deport the assailant, but after investigating Washington, it was found that the assailant had already become a US citizen, so it is impossible to deport him. He will be questioned in court here tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Miami, 16th: Sangala was formally charged today in criminal court with the murder of President-elect Roosevelt and three others. The maximum penalty for each count is 20 years in prison. The defendant shouted wildly at the judge, "I don't want anyone's help. You are the judge, do what you want." After a postponement, the trial will resume tomorrow, and the best lawyer will be appointed to defend him. As for the injuries to Chicago Mayor Cermak and Mrs. Gill, the director of the Florida Electric Company, the eight lawsuits have not been added, because if one of the two, unfortunately, dies, they must be charged with first-degree murder, which could result in the death penalty.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Does Not Want Bodyguards to Protect Her Husband</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ithaca, 17th: Mrs. Roosevelt, President-elect Roosevelt's wife, came here to give a lecture. Today, she told a Reuters reporter that she did not believe it was necessary to advise her husband to take any precautions. This incident will definitely not disturb her husband, but of course, she cannot be indifferent to the injured. She does not think her husband is constantly in fear of death or imminent danger.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th: Today, the entire nation expressed outrage at the conspiracy to assassinate Roosevelt. The authorities are now paying serious attention to Roosevelt's safety. In the future, eight hundred detectives will be assigned to secretly follow Roosevelt to protect him. At the same time, other dignitaries will be strictly protected in the near future. However, Mrs. Roosevelt said today that she does not want bodyguards to protect the safety of her individual and her family. She said, "If assassins are determined to kill you, they will eventually achieve their purpose. It is better to act as if nothing has happened and not pay attention." As for Roosevelt himself, he is also unwilling to change his daily work. When someone asked him to reduce the number of celebrations and cancel some social engagements, Roosevelt refused, giving various reasons.</p>
<p>British-Japanese Trade Competition Causes</p>
<h3>Problems with Commercial Treaty's Existence</h3>
<p>British Government Considers Carefully</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: At the House of Commons meeting today, Hanmersley, the Labor Party member of parliament from Stockport, proposed that the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty should be abolished due to the intense competition from Japanese foreign trade to England. Hanmersley said that unless Britain can give Japanese goods discriminatory treatment, it will be difficult to effectively curb Japanese competition. Keerwei, the representative of the Department of Commerce, replied that the British government's policy is absolutely not to abolish commercial treaties with any country. However, if the benefits of abolishing a commercial treaty are greater than the benefits of its existence, then this is not the case. All British colonies affected by Japanese commercial competition are free to unilaterally abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, so there is no need to abolish it as a whole. However, the notice must be issued one year before the cancellation takes effect. Keerwei stated at the end that the matter is under careful consideration by the government.</p>
<h3>Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty Ratified</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 16th: It was announced here today that the Franco-Soviet non-aggression treaty, signed on November 11th last year in Paris by the Soviet ambassador to France, Duvgalifsky, and the French Prime Minister Herriot, was ratified by French President Lebrun on February 11th. The treaty was also ratified by the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on February 15th. After the exchange of ratification documents by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Christianeski and the French ambassador to the Soviet Union, Techien, at the Foreign Affairs Committee on the 15th, it was announced that the treaty was in effect.</p>
<h3>The Situation of a Strike in France</h3>
<p>Paris, 16th (Havas Dispatch) - The various trade associations of France had originally scheduled a strike of shops in Paris and nationwide this afternoon to protest the government's newly established tax regulations.  Shops in Paris were unable to comply uniformly. The strike was fully effective in the central areas of the city, but its effect waned in the more remote areas. On the most prosperous Boulevard de l'Opéra, all luxury goods stores and barbershops were closed.  All clothing stores on Rue de la Paix were also closed. The street scene was no different from a Sunday rest. On other major streets, all shops except department stores, hotels, grocery stores, and butcher shops were closed.  Often, closed shops stood side-by-side with shops that remained open. As a result, those that did not strike were able to take the opportunity to profit. In the Montparnasse and Montmartre districts, where there are the most cafes and dance halls, only one-tenth of the shops closed.  Generally speaking, the overall scene in the city was only slightly different from usual. The number of police officers on the streets was slightly increased to prevent unforeseen events. By evening, the majority of merchants who had not struck also closed their doors one after another, because those who supported the strike sometimes forced neighboring shops to participate, even against their will. For example, when striking merchants saw a shop open for business, they would gather a crowd of people, swarm in, and occupy the premises, preventing it from operating until the shop owner agreed to close.  This was often the tactic used. However, cafes and food shops remained open until the end. In the evening, most of the lights in the bustling city shops were extinguished. Paris, which is usually a city that never sleeps, could not help but reveal a touch of desolation this time. Shops in various provinces across the country also held strikes, but daily life was not disrupted, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Resurgence of Former German Military Officers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Reuters) - The "Vorwärts" newspaper was previously ordered to suspend publication for several days by the Berlin Police Commissioner for publishing a Socialist Party election manifesto, which was deemed to incite violence and treason. Recently, the newspaper published an article questioning the authorities' report on the conflict between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party in the Eslippin area last week, and was again banned from publication. The newspaper appealed to the Leipzig Supreme Court, which today ruled that the first order to suspend publication was illegal. Therefore, the newspaper can now demand compensation for losses from the State of Prussia. The police chiefs of the State of Prussia are now all National Socialist Party members, replacing Socialists.  Almost all of these people are former officers of the Imperial Army who can boast of their wartime achievements. For example, Hamburg Police Chief Captain Christiansen, during the European War, drove a steamship carrying food through the blockade to German East Africa to relieve the German army there. When returning to Germany, he was detained in South Africa as a spy, but was later released and allowed to return to Germany.</p>
<h3>Japan to Hold Large-Scale Air Defense Drill</h3>

Participants will include the army, the air force, and the 8th Division, commanded by Lieutenant General Kihara, commander of the Tokyo Defense Force.</p>
<p>Another Statement by the Chinese Representative to Japan</p>
<h3>The Spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth</h3>
<p>Geneva Correspondence - Mr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the Council of the League of Nations, believes that the memorandum issued by the Japanese representative on November 28, and the speeches given on December 6 and 8 at the special assembly, not only insult China but also do not conform to the facts. Fearing that the world would be misled by one-sided statements, he again described the true situation in detail, paying special attention to the secret Sino-Russian agreement, the Jinan Incident, the Communist Party, and the Manchurian issue. On December 27, he sent it to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations for reference by the member states. The original text is in English, and now the translation is as follows:</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>After the Chinese representative spoke at the Council of the League of Nations on November 21, the Japanese representative submitted a memorandum on November 28. The Chinese delegation also sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on December 3 to refute the points made in the Japanese delegation's memorandum. The Chinese representative also raised objections to the statements made by the Japanese representative at the two special assemblies on December 6 and 8 at the afternoon meeting on December 8. However, there are other far-fetched points in the Japanese side's memorandum and statement that China cannot remain silent about. Now, their fallacies will be pointed out one by one as follows:</p>
<p>On November 21, at the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, the Chinese representative presented a book written by Mr. Goto Shimpei, "The Actions of the Japanese Army and Japanese in Manchuria and Mongolia". The book details the Japanese government's various plans to disturb the Chinese people to obstruct China's unification. In its memorandum, the Japanese representative argued that Goto was out of office when he wrote the book, and that his purpose was only domestic. However, the materials in the author's book were all collected by him during his own inspections in Manchuria or from official Japanese government documents, and the Japanese representative did not deny any of what he said. This point is extremely noteworthy. The Japanese representative also stated that at the beginning of the Republic of China, a Japanese colonel planned a restoration movement in Manchuria, and the Japanese government, after learning about it, tried to stop it. The Chinese representative did not raise this matter and expressed regret. However, the reason why the Japanese government stopped this movement is detailed in Mr. Goto's booklet. Goto said, "The royal government and Colonel Doi were not very familiar with the true situation in Manchuria, and their relationship with the Japanese rogues who specialized in disturbing China's security was not very close. Therefore, the Japanese authorities' plan to start an incident in Manchuria completely failed. However, in the spring of 1916, they were still able to gather more than 2,000 people in Dalian to form a royalist army. Unfortunately, although Japan spent a huge amount of money, these bandits and coolies could not be fully used by us." Regarding the Tanaka Memorial, the Chinese representative has spoken in detail. Now, only one point needs to be pointed out. The Japanese representative stated that former Foreign Minister of the National Government, Dr. Wang Zhengting, had allowed Japan to find a way to prevent the circulation of the document. Dr. Wang made a strong denial in a conversation with reporters from the Central News Agency on November 25. This news has been published in newspapers all over Europe. Furthermore, allowing the prevention of the circulation of this document cannot be immediately regarded as accepting Japan's denial of the document's authenticity.</p>
<p>In its statement, the Japanese representative stated that when the Japanese government withdrew its troops stationed in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, in 1927, "it received a request from General Chiang's government asking the Japanese army to continue to stay there until the government could properly ensure the safety of Shandong Province." This request is completely fictitious, and the Chinese government has never made such a request.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one other matter of equal importance that should be noted. The Japanese representative has admitted that in 1928, Baron Hayashi Gonsuke, Consul General Hayashi Kyujiro, and Lieutenant General Sato Yasunosuke strongly advised General Zhang Xueliang not to join forces with the Nanjing Central Government. The Japanese explanation for this attempt to obstruct China's political unification is that it was out of General Zhang Xueliang's own free will. The Chinese representative has sent a telegram to General Zhang to inquire, and has now received a reply stating, "If Japan could be so concerned about my wishes, then why would it act completely against my wishes in other matters? The fact of Japanese interference at that time is well known in Chinese and foreign official circles, and there is no need to elaborate further. If evidence is needed, there are still many written documents that can be used as proof. If I was unwilling to raise the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, then how could the blue and white flag be flying everywhere in the Northeast?"</p>
<p>In addition to falsely claiming that China has failed to fulfill its treaty obligations, the Japanese representative also stated that the National Government openly insists on adopting an anti-foreign policy. The Chinese delegation has repeatedly issued declarations and statements to explain the fallacy of the Japanese side's statement.</p>
<p>Now, let's present one example as proof. As of June 1, 1932, the total number of employees hired by the Chinese Customs was 8,832, of which 924 were foreign nationals, including 199 Japanese nationals. Japanese officials in Manchurian customs are also included, and almost all of them have now abandoned their allegiance to the Qing Dynasty and joined the service of "Manchukuo". However, the Chinese government has not suspended any of these Japanese officials, except for Fukuoto Juntaro, the Customs Commissioner of Dalian, who was dismissed for insubordination. The Secretary-General, whose position is currently second only to the Inspector General of Customs, is also Japanese. Is there any more obvious proof that China has absolutely no anti-foreign policy?</p>
<p>In its statement, the Japanese representative also stated,</p>
<p>"The Chinese representative pointed out the number of foreign personnel in government agencies as proof that China has no anti-foreign sentiments, which is not enough to prove anything. The Chinese government accepts these foreign personnel only because it is clearly stipulated in treaties and agreements and cannot do otherwise."</p>
<p>This statement by the Japanese representative not only fails to prove that the Chinese government has any so-called anti-foreign ideology, but also shows that Japan's false accusation that China cannot fulfill its treaty obligations has been refuted by its own statements. Although Japan has done its utmost to provoke trouble, even invading China's three eastern provinces, China still respects its treaty obligations. However, in terms of the friendship between China and Japan, and in terms of the disloyal fact that the majority of Japanese officials serving in the Chinese Customs have joined the service of the puppet state, China would have sufficient reason to dismiss all Japanese officials.</p>
<p>In its statement, the Japanese representative also stated that the majority of foreign personnel serving in the Chinese salt administration and certain railways have been expelled. This statement is also inaccurate. In order to save expenses, improve efficiency, and take into account the public interest, the Chinese government has made changes to personnel due to various reforms. However, the result of these changes is not only without any so-called "great unfortunate impact," but in fact has significant progress. Taking the Salt Revenue Audit Office as an example, on September 26, 1928, the National Government officially ordered that the office be formally placed under the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, it was stipulated that all audit offices across the country should be restored, and that if the tax revenue could not be fully allocated to the central government, at least a portion should be remitted to the national treasury for the repayment of national debt. After implementation, efficiency has been greatly improved. Finance Minister Song Ziwen issued a report on the progress of China's finances in August of this year, stating that by September 1929, the plan had achieved a great deal. The Ministry of Finance could not only pay the arrears in full each year, but also gradually repay the outstanding old debts. By the end of 1930, the accumulated interest on the British, French, and Crisp loans had been fully paid off, and the repayment of the accumulated principal had also begun. The portion of the arrears of the Hukuang loan that should be allocated from the salt tax was also fully paid off in 1931. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui's Strategies After Returning to Chengdu</h3>
<p>"Take Chengdu by Negotiation, Take Tong and Mian by Force"</p>
<p>Suppress Tian and Deng, Expand Territory</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence - After the cessation of the Sichuan War, Liu Wenhui, with no major forces pressing on the front, naturally returned to Chengdu and decided to adopt the strategy of "taking Chengdu by negotiation and taking Tong and Mian by force." Tian Songyao, who occupied Chengdu, was attacked by the Communist bandits in the rear, and Liu Xiang treated him with disdain, so he had to submit to Liu Wenhui's threat. As a result, Liu Wenhui recovered Chengdu without using a single soldier. However, Liu Wenhui's hope was not only to recover Chengdu, but also to use his entire military force to suppress Tian Songyao and Deng Xihou, forcing them to submit completely. His strategies toward Tian were: (1) to demand that Tian cede ten counties of defense area to support the 24th Army; (2) the Chengdu Arsenal should belong to the 24th Army, so as to supply machinery and ammunition to strengthen the defense of western Sichuan. His strategies toward Deng were: (1) to return the three counties of Huayang, Jianyang, and Ziyang that had been ceded previously; (2) to resolve the Huang Yin Division and the Chen Shunong Division that participated in the war; (3) the Chengdu Municipal Government under the rule of the 28th Army should belong to the 24th Army, otherwise military solutions would be pursued. Tian and Deng believed that without the support of the 24th Army, it would be difficult to resist. They could only try to make peace with Liu, but Liu Wenhui's strong attitude could not be resolved by peaceful means. As a result, Tian agreed to cede five counties to the 24th Army after the bandit suppression military operations came to an end, and requested that he not invade with heavy troops during the bandit suppression period. It is said that Liu has made considerable promises. Therefore, Tian Songyao returned to Tongchuan with a belly full of worries and anger to plan bandit suppression. As for Deng Xihou, on the one hand, he completely transferred the Chen Shunong Department stationed in Chengdu to Ziyang to avoid direct conflict with the 24th Army. On the other hand, he sent Chief of Staff Niu Fanjiu to persuade Liu Wenhui and the Baoding faction generals of the 24th Army to explain the current predicament of the 28th Army and request concessions. Deng also expressed to Liu: (1) to hand over the Chengdu Municipal Government; (2) to return the defense areas of Huayang and Jianyang counties. As for the resolution of the Huang Yin Division, it is feared that there is no way. Therefore, the Huang Division's defense areas in Pixian, Guanxian, Chongning, and other counties have begun to dig trenches to prevent the 24th Army from attacking. However, Huang Yin also went to Chengdu in person to lobby, hoping to mediate. In short, the recent situation is extremely tense. However, because of the classmates relationship among the generals of Liu Wenhui's department, most of them are unwilling to oppress the 28th Army and have also expressed understanding for Deng himself. However, Huang Yin must be given a beating. Now Deng is negotiating with Liu on the handling of the Huang Division issue. Under this pressure, Deng has not gained much benefit from befriending Liu Xiang, but has turned against Liu Wenhui. He should also deeply regret that it was not worth it. Moreover, the 24th Army has formally taken over Huayang and Jianyang counties on February 2 and 3, and will take over the Chengdu Municipal Government again in a few days. At this moment, the position of the 24th Army in Chengdu is higher than that of Deng and Tian. Especially Deng is in a more embarrassing situation. According to news from the military authorities, the issue of the Huang Yin Division has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. At present, the power of life and death of Huang Yin seems to be entirely in Liu Wenhui's grasp. Therefore, Deng Xihou's attitude is particularly passive, which is probably beyond Deng's initial expectations.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Prepares for National Defense</h3>
<p>The Authorities and the People are Actively Engaged</p>
<p>It is Expected that the Entire Province Will Be Militarized in Five Years</p>
<p>Nanning Correspondence - The Guangxi authorities and people from all walks of life are quite active in preparing for national defense. A brief record of recent developments is given below.</p>
<h3>Intensify the Training of the Militia</h3>
<p>Since the Guangxi authorities decided on the policy of "arming the people through the militia," they have been determined to run the militia and have achieved considerable results. Recently, with the urgency of national difficulties, they have intensified the training of the militia. Regarding the regular troops, in the original six militia districts, each district has twelve regular troops, and every four troops are organized into a large team, so as to be concentrated for training at any time and to be easily deployed in case of emergency. Regarding the training of the reserve troops, it has been decided to organize all three million able-bodied men in the province into reserve troops, divided into ten phases for training (each phase is half a year). Each phase will train 300,000 people. All militia budget and training rules have been compiled and are scheduled to be implemented this year. In addition, it has been decided that all soldiers in each team will be transferred from the trained militia to join the army, so that the militia and the army are integrated to realize the conscription system. It is expected that in five years, the entire province will be militarized.</p>
<h3>Strictly Implement Military Training for Students</h3>
<p>The Guangxi military and political conference in the 20th year resolved to implement military training in schools above the high school level to cultivate talent for officers and cultivate the people's military force. Since its implementation, the results have been good. Recently, in order to enrich the strength of national salvation, the training of the militia has been intensified. The training of the militia cadres cannot but be actively cultivated. Therefore, the government has made every effort to promote military training for students. In the high schools and above, in addition to ordering the school authorities to intensify training, it has also been found that the schools are distributed in various places, and it is difficult to supervise them thoroughly, resulting in varying degrees of progress and unremarkable results. Now, in order to rectify military training and achieve practical results, according to the location of each school, senior military or militia officers are appointed as military training supervisors. Except for the First Senior High School, which is occasionally inspected by the headquarters, Xia Wei is assigned as the military training supervisor for Guangxi University and the Fourth High School, Zhou Zuhuang is assigned as the military training supervisor for the Normal College and the Third High School, Liao Lei is assigned as the military training supervisor for the senior department of the Fourth High School, and Jiang Ruquan is assigned as the military training supervisor for the Second High School and the senior department of the Eighth High School, and they are strictly urged at any time. In the junior high schools, it has also been decided that all students over the age of sixteen will be given youth military training. The training methods have been stipulated, and the training personnel have also been assigned, and it is decided to implement it from this semester. It is found that there are more than 80 provincial and county middle schools in Guangxi Province, with about 20,000 students in total. About 15,000 or more have reached the age of military training. In the future, after the training is completed, there will be no shortage of talent for militia cadres.</p>
<h3>Consolidate the Borderland Customs</h3>
<p>Longzhou is an important fortress for national defense in southern China. The Fourth Group Army Headquarters and the Guangxi Provincial Government have specially appointed Li Pinxian as the Supervising Officer of Customs Affairs in Longzhou. Since the September 18th Incident, Supervising Officer Li, seeing that the three northeastern provinces were lost in no time because they were unprepared, has made every effort to manage national defense work, restoring the nine offices of the Customs Affairs Office and changing the patrol team to the Customs Affairs Police Team to maintain border security. The original fortresses, whose collapses or incomplete artillery parts have been repaired, and the organization of the fortress artillery team, and the construction of bunkers and barracks to strengthen border defense.</p>
<h3>The People Prepare for Air Defense</h3>
<p>For the sake of resisting aggression and defending against the enemy, the people of Guangxi urgently need to make air defense preparations to avoid being attacked by enemy aircraft. Therefore, at the January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese Memorial Conference, it was passed to set up the Guangxi Air Defense Committee, and the Provincial Party Headquarters, the General Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Chamber of Commerce, the Trade Union, the Women's Association, the Student Union, the Military Academy, the Public Security Bureau, the Construction Department, the Yongning County Government, the Nanning Minguo Daily, and the Provincial Anti-Japanese Association were elected as members of the Preparatory Committee to plan all the proceedings. It is planned that each first-class county will purchase one anti-aircraft gun, two second-class counties will jointly purchase one anti-aircraft gun, and each third-class county will purchase one or two anti-aircraft machine guns. As for the detailed methods, they are still being deliberated. It is now found that the Preparatory Committee has drafted the general regulations of the Provincial Air Defense Committee, and will formally organize and establish it after it has been approved by the senior party, government, and military agencies.

<h3>Mao Weishou Goes to Northern Fujian to Suppress the Communists</h3>
<p>Because the Jiangxi Bandits Fled to Fujian in Three Routes</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence - The General Headquarters of the 19th Route Army held a military conference in Zhangzhou on February 7. Those who attended were Huang Renhuan, Zhang Zhen, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, Shen Guanghan, Zhang Yan, Tan Qixiu, Zhao Yijian, etc., chaired by Huang Qiang. The meeting opened at 10:00 a.m. and closed at 12:00 p.m. The discussions were mainly about the anti-Japanese and bandit suppression incidents. After the meeting, the division and brigade commanders returned to their original defenses. However, Huang Renhuan, Mao Weishou, and Zhang Yan took the Zhang-Quan-Fu long-distance bus to the province and arrived on the evening of the 11th and stayed at the Pacification Commissioner's Office. It is said that Huang represents Chen Jitang and is in contact with Jiang Guangnai on important matters. He will return to Shanghang to his original defense within four or five days. Mao Weishou and Zhang Yan will go to Shaowu to direct the bandit suppression, because after the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi retreated into northern Fujian, they captured Guangze and coordinated with the Red bandits in Chong'an and Taining. Guangze is the central route, spying on Shaowu, Chong'an is the left route, spying on Jianyang, and Taining is the right route, spying on Jiangle. Fortunately, the defense line of the government army is very solid. Jianyang and Jiangle have been defeated by the 56th Division's Liu Shangzhi and Gui Zhenyuan's two brigades. On the Shaowu route, the bandits are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Ma Hongxing's regiment in Longdou, which borders Guangze. After Mao Weishou arrives in Shao, he decided to immediately command the troops of Zhang Yan, Jiang Yan, and Zhou Zhijun's three brigades to launch a second general offensive and take Guangze within a limited time to cut off the bandits' communication, and then advance into Chong'an and Taining. As for Cai Tingkai, he arrived in Xiamen from Hong Kong on the 10th and went to Zhangzhou. After dealing with the official affairs of the General Headquarters, he will come to the province.

<h3>Large-Scale Afforestation in the Taihang Mountains</h3>
<p>Henan Province Promotes the Afforestation Movement</p>
<p>The Number of Trees Planted Daily Has Reached Thousands</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence - The Taihang Mountains are the only large mountains in North China, spreading across the provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi, with a large area. Because of the indiscriminate felling of trees over the years, the forests have been almost exhausted, resulting in mountain collapses, river breaches, and frequent floods and droughts. Those who know are worried about it. Previously, the Fifth Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of Henan Province promoted the afforestation movement by the people in the Taihang Mountains, which has been going on for two months. More than 20 enlightened rural villages near the mountains have recently gone to the bureau to receive seedlings and plant trees on their own initiative. At present, the number of people who continue to plant trees on the mountains every day often reaches about 1,000. The location is in the Jiushan area in the middle section of the Taihang Mountains, and it is said that it will be promoted from both the north and south sides. It is estimated that the Taihang Mountains are about a thousand miles within the border of Henan Province, and substantial results can be achieved in about three or four years. The general mountain people's hope of restoring the old view and increasing production is full of infinite optimism.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Consul in Shantou Protests to the Chao'an County Government</h3>
<p>Claiming that the Anti-Japanese Association Beat Taiwanese Merchants</p>
<p>Making Four Unreasonable Demands on Us</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - The Chao'an County Government suddenly received a letter from the Japanese Consul in Shantou, stating, "Xie Shidou, a Taiwanese national, aged 49, residing at No. 10 Fuxiang Lane, is a grocery merchant. At 2:00 p.m. on January 28, he was beaten and injured by members of the Chao'an County Anti-Japanese Association while selling wind ball rubber products by the side of the Xima Road in Chaozhou City," etc., and attached requests: (1) Punish the perpetrators of the Anti-Japanese Association; (2) Compensate for the loss of the damaged goods and all losses; (3) Bear the cost of reimbursing all medical expenses; (4) Guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future, and order the military and police to protect the Japanese people residing in Chao'an. The letter was attached with Xie's diagnosis certificate and injury bill. After receiving the letter, the Chao'an County Government immediately informed the county's Anti-Japanese Association to investigate the incident in detail. The Anti-Japanese Association immediately ordered the cadres Li Kaili and Chen Jizhi to investigate and report back. The results of the detailed investigation were submitted to the county government, and the text is as follows: "According to the investigators of the Chao'an Anti-Japanese Association, Yu Ziyi and others, the team went to Fugang on the afternoon of the 28th of last month to seize enemy goods based on reports, and did not stay in Chaozhou City. There is a warrant from the Anti-Japanese Association as proof. We went to the scene of the incident on Xima Road to investigate. According to the shop staff on both sides of the road, no one was seen fighting on the road that day. We also visited the police officer Chen Rongsheng on duty that day, and according to him, the situation was the same as before. It was also found that Xie Shidou went to the Chao'an Branch Court for injury examination on the afternoon of the 28th of last month, and claimed that he was selling children's toys on Xima Road, and that more than ten people whose names he did not know had injured the people with unknown objects. The above items are consistent with the claim in the letter that Xie Shidou was selling rubber wind balls and was severely beaten by members of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association with sticks and short sticks, and that the police at the scene stood by and did not provide protection. All the details are purely fictitious. If it was true that it happened that day, why didn't Xie Shidou, being a national of a civilized country, report to the police on duty at the scene or take advantage of the examination by the doctor in the public hospital, but instead privately went to the hospital of Zheng Yunxiang, a national of the country, to collude and create a diagnosis certificate, which is obviously a deliberate frame-up. Moreover, even if Xie Shidou was beaten, there is no accurate proof of the address of the incident, and he has not been able to provide who injured him. Since he has requested an examination from the government court, he should wait for a legal investigation and verification of what happened, where he was injured, and who injured him. Since he claimed that he did not know who injured him, he falsely claimed that he was beaten by members of the Anti-Japanese Association on Xima Road and slandered the local police. It is difficult to guarantee that he was not injured in other places due to illegal acts, or that he deliberately pretended to be injured and made false accusations to vent his personal anger. The Consulate did not investigate in detail, and only made harsh demands based on the one-sided words of the national, which is somewhat lacking in international etiquette. Before receiving the order, the reason should be to report the real situation of the investigation." The Chao'an County Magistrate Liao has replied to the Japanese Consul in Shantou based on the results of this investigation. (February 11)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Shi Dagong and Wang Renzhao</p>
<p>Arrested and Sent to the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>Shi Dagong and Wang Renzhao, residents of Tinglin Town, District 12, of this county, were previously suspected of a certain crime. The provincial government ordered the local county government to instruct the police to arrest them and detain them in the county government. After several interrogations, the county government received another order from the provincial government yesterday, dispatching police to escort the two suspects, Shi and Wang, to the provincial capital yesterday (the 17th) afternoon for interrogation and verification.</p>
<h3>Request to Reduce the Additional Grain Tax: Provincial Approval</h3>
<p>Li Zuhua, director of the Public Funds and Public Property Management Office of this county, and others previously telegraphed the ministry to appeal for a reduction of the two yuan penalty for late payment of the winter grain tax this year, in order to alleviate the people's hardship, etc. This was previously reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the office received a directive from the Ministry of Finance, No. 2030, which stated, "The gist of the telegram is noted. It is hereby ordered to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to make a thorough correction accordingly."</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Representatives from Various Industries Discuss Business Tax</p>
<p>In order to rectify the business tax in Wuxian County, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance immediately dispatched personnel to work with representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce to come to Suzhou to investigate and fill out the business registration forms of various stores. The Provincial Federation of Commerce has already notified the County Chamber of Commerce. The County Chamber of Commerce specifically convened a meeting of representatives from various industries at 2 p.m. on the 17th, with over eighty attendees. Chairman Shi Yunqing earnestly encouraged the various businesses to fill out the registration forms according to regulations and to promptly pay the outstanding taxes for the autumn and winter seasons of last year. The representatives from various industries expressed their difficulties, citing the sluggish state of their respective businesses. Regarding the filling out of the registration forms, they stated that due to the declining state of commerce, the volume of business this year cannot be compared to previous years. It was decided on the spot that when the representatives from the Provincial Department come to Suzhou, they should be asked to consider the decline in commerce and grant appropriate leniency.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Minutes of the Meeting of the Joint Sericulture Control Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>

After a lengthy discussion, all were passed as is. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>District Defense Training Class</p>
<p>Militiamen Disrupt Theater</p>
<p>The county government of this county previously received an order from the provincial government to organize a district militia training class in order to defend the local area. Over six hundred militiamen from all fifteen districts of the city gathered in the city on the 14th for a grand review. Commissioner Zhao Zhengping was dispatched by the province to Changshu. On that day, after the review was completed, awards were given on the 15th. The provincial commissioner left Changshu immediately. Unexpectedly, that night, over two hundred militiamen from the third, fourth, and seventh districts, all armed, went to leisurely watch a play. Upon arrival, they occupied superior seats upstairs, while the seventh district sat downstairs. The ticket collector went upstairs to sell tickets, but they ignored him. Unexpectedly, at about 10 p.m., while a double act was being performed on stage, one of the armed militiamen in the middle row upstairs, who looked like a drill instructor, first threw a teapot onto the stage and started to curse loudly. The audience was slightly disturbed, but the performers on stage remained calm. However, the armed militiamen upstairs first took away the symbols, then stood up one after another and threw teacups, teapots, and rattan chairs everywhere, causing great chaos. The audience scrambled to escape through the emergency exits, and the performance was halted. Most shockingly, some of the militiamen even threw copper kettles filled with boiling water from the tea stove downstairs, splashing the boiling water everywhere and scalding a child surnamed Mou on the mouth. At that time, due to the extreme congestion in the emergency exit, another child fell to the ground and was seriously injured by being trampled. After receiving the news, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched sixty armed police to suppress the situation. The drill instructor who started the trouble first escaped through the west emergency exit by climbing over the wall. The Public Security Bureau police immediately detained the militiamen from the defense training class, and County Magistrate Tan urgently ordered the district chiefs to restrain and manage them themselves. It was later discovered that the leader was Shen Ziqiao, the drill instructor of the third district. The theater then made three demands: (1) Send the leading drill instructor, Shen Ziqiao, to the judiciary for investigation. (2) The losses of the theater should be clearly defined. (3) How should the unsold tickets and audience losses be handled? Wu, the district chief, agreed to the first item. Furthermore, it was learned that on the afternoon of the 16th, Dai Liangju and others came forward to mediate and agreed to the theater's request to send Shen Ziqiao to the judiciary for investigation. However, Shen had already escaped over the wall and was waiting to be captured and sent to the county. No clear statement was made regarding the remaining conditions. The theater continued to perform on the night of the 16th.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Five Counties in Jiangbei Join Forces to Suppress Mutinous Soldiers</p>
<p>Over two hundred mutinous soldiers from the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Guerrilla Unit recently roamed along the coast, wreaking havoc in the Lv, Feng, and Peng salt fields, causing great harm. The Provincial Security Office specifically ordered the county magistrates of Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Rugao, and Dongtai to lead their respective county police teams and defense corps to join forces with the provincial land and water police corps to suppress them. On the 16th, they set out from Lvsi and Sanjia towns at dawn, with Corps Commander Zhu serving as the commander-in-chief.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Crowd at Competition Smashes Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Residents of Zhenhai traditionally hold lantern competitions during the Lantern Festival after the lunar new year, which are very grand in scale. However, they have been repeatedly banned by the authorities in recent years, so they have not been held for seven or eight years. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 14th), some individuals with good intentions re-initiated the event, planning to hold it for five consecutive days starting on the 14th, with all residents and businesses participating. At about 6 p.m. on the 14th, everyone gathered at the parade ground, preparing to set off on a parade. For a time, viewers gathered, and the road became blocked. The County Public Security Bureau learned of the matter and immediately sent a team to stop it. At this time, it could have been resolved peacefully. Unexpectedly, a group of vagrants incited the crowd, who swarmed to the front of the Public Security Bureau and made a great disturbance. They then carried out a riot, destroying eleven rooms in the bureau chief's office, police dormitory, kitchen, and detention center. Two offenders in the detention center took the opportunity to escape. The bedding, clothes, boxes, and baskets in the chief's office and police dormitory were all destroyed or stolen by hooligans, and nothing remained. Subsequently, the First Garrison Battalion arrived, and the rioters, seeing the unfavorable situation, began to disperse.</p>
<h3>Rioters Rampage on Daishan Island</h3>
<p>The Donghai轮 (Donghai Ship) of the Ningbo Shipping Bureau in Yongbu (Ningbo) departed from Daishan on the morning of the 14th at 8 am, carrying cargo and passengers. At 5 pm in the evening, it arrived at the Gaoting waters more than ten li from Daishan. Suddenly, a small boatman reported that there were seventy to eighty rioters rampaging on Daishan, and the local people were deeply worried. After receiving the news, the ship dared not move forward and immediately returned to Yongbu. In addition, the Xin Sanbei 轮 (New Sanbei Ship) of the Sanbei Company departed from Shenjiamen for Yongbu at 5 am on the 15th. When it passed the Qingyantou port surface, more than eight li away from Zhoushan, seven or eight rioters suddenly came from the left bank, first fired shots to demonstrate, and then ordered the ship to stop. Seeing the bad situation, the shipowner immediately opened the accelerator and fled. The rioters fired shots, and one bullet hit the third-class cabin of the ship at the time, piercing six deck planks and falling into the dining room. Fortunately, no one was injured. In addition, the Dazing small ship, which was sailing between Daishan and Shenjiamen, had been robbed and used by the rioters. On the afternoon of the 14th, after the merchants in Shenjiamen learned of the alarming news from Daishan, people were panicked, and the market closed early. However, it is still impossible to find out where the rioters came from and the extent to which Daishan was ravaged by bandits. However, according to general speculation, the rioters should be part of the mutinous soldiers of Liu Zhennian's division in Taigu County, Wenzhou.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, those who went to the pier to welcome him in succession included representatives from the China Film Culture Association, the Shanghai Theater Troupe Federation, Hong Shen, Ying Yunwei, the Shanghai Student Theater Society Aid Righteous Army Entertainment Conference Delegation, and four hundred young men and women who admired Shaw, each holding welcome flags and raising welcome slogans for Shaw, eagerly hoping to catch a glimpse of Shaw's demeanor and express their sincere intentions. Lin Yutang, Shao Xunmei, and more than twenty Chinese and foreign journalists from the People's Rights Protection League also waited for Shaw to arrive for an interview. From 6 a.m. to over 12 noon, their enthusiasm did not diminish, and the enthusiastic scene was rarely seen in the past. The Shanghai Student Theater Society Aid Righteous Army Entertainment Conference also issued a declaration to welcome Shaw to Shanghai. The final slogans were as follows: Welcome Revolutionary Artist George Bernard Shaw, Welcome Playwright George Bernard Shaw, Welcome God of Peace George Bernard Shaw, Welcome Shaw Who Sympathizes with China's Territorial Integrity, Welcome Shaw Who Sympathizes with China's Independence and Liberation, Welcome Shaw, Vanguard of Anti-Imperialism, Welcome Shaw to Overthrow Imperialism, Welcome Shaw to Oppose Japanese Aggression in North China, Welcome Shaw to Oppose the Second World War, Welcome Shaw Not to Be a Laggard of the Times.</p>
<h3>Soong Ching-ling Welcomed Him</h3>
<p>Madame Soong Ching-ling and Shaw are both honorary chairmen of the World Anti-Imperialist League. Therefore, Madame Sun, accompanied by Yang Xingfo and others, took the Jinghan small ship from Xinkai Pier at 5 o'clock yesterday morning and sailed to Wusongkou to welcome him. The water patrol team dispatched many water police officers to escort the ship. At that time, many news reporters and Hong Shen and others, representatives of the Theater Association, also planned to attach themselves to the ship, but they were all refused, saying that this was a special ship and did not carry other passengers.</p>
<h3>Quietly Landed Together</h3>
<p>Madame Sun arrived at Songkou at 6:45 a.m., boarded the British Queen Ship, visited Mr. Shaw, and was very happy to see him. Mr. Shaw immediately invited Madame Sun to sit opposite him in the dining room and have breakfast together. Mr. Shaw was already seventy-seven years old, but he had a youthful face and white hair, and he was full of energy. Mr. Shaw originally intended not to land due to Madame Sun's illness, but at Madame Sun's strong request, his interest in traveling was renewed. At the time, all parties were waiting to welcome him at the Xinguang Wharf, but Mr. Shaw quietly landed with Madame Soong Ching-ling at the Yangshupu Wharf at 10:30 a.m., hired a streetcar, and went to Sun's residence at 29 Moliere Road to rest. The welcoming staff did not return sadly until they received a telephone report from the water police.</p>

<h3>Visited Cai Yuanpei</h3>
<p>After Mr. Shaw and Madame Sun landed, they first went to the Richard Hotel on the Bund to meet with members of various tourist groups who had also come to Shanghai. After a brief greeting, they went to Albert Road to visit Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica. At twelve o'clock, they went to Sun's residence to attend Madame Sun's lunch, which was Chinese cuisine. Those who accompanied him were Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, Lin Yutang, and Yi Luosheng, etc. At about 2 p.m., this white-haired and silver-bearded literary giant, full of energy, accompanied by Lin Yutang, Cai Yuanpei, and Yang Xingfo, etc., suddenly came out of Sun's residence with smiles on their faces, got into a car, and went to the World Academy to attend a gathering hosted by the literary association.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Attended</h3>
<p>When Mr. Shaw and others arrived at the World Academic Society, Mei Lanfang, Ye Gongchuo, Zhang Xinhai and his wife, Shao Xunmei, and Miss Tang Ying, etc., had already arrived. Zhang Xinhai introduced them one by one and shook hands with Shaw as a courtesy. When introducing Mei Lanfang, Mr. Shaw talked with him for a long time, with Zhang Xinhai translating. Mr. Shaw said that British dramas do not have the sound of iron drums, etc. As soon as there is noise during the performance, it will damage the audience's attention. However, Chinese dramas are quite accustomed to noise. Mei replied that there are two types of Chinese dramas, such as Kunqu, which is not noisy. Mr. Ye Gongchuo immediately said that Mr. Mei's performances do not have noise, and if there is, it is only the assistance of music. Mr. Mei then expressed his admiration and said that he has been living on stage for thirty years and has always known that Irish people are full of loyalty and friendship. In the future, he would like to get to know Mr. Shaw and become a friend. When Shaw heard that Mr. Mei had been living on stage for thirty years, he stared at his face and said, "You truly have the art of staying young." After talking with Mr. Mei, Shaw stood up and made a humorous speech, the main points of which are as follows: "A speech is not necessary at this moment, because everyone here is a writer. I am truly showing off my axe in front of the door. Ordinary people regard writers as mysterious and great figures. Now that you all know the content, what is the point of saying more? Moreover, writers are actually laborers, but their wages are less than those of laborers." At this time, Lin Yutang said to Shaw, "Sir, you may not be entirely right." (Because the royalties drawn from Mr. Shaw's books in the UK are particularly heavy.) Shaw replied that not all of my works have income. (According to Shaw's practice, small books or speeches on social issues are not charged.) Moreover, my plays earn money and are all given to me by the actors. Mr. Mei, who is present, can prove that this statement is true. Shaw then said, "I am here like an exhibit in a zoo. Everyone has seen it, and I don't need to say more." After the speech, Ye Gongchuo asked Shaw why he didn't eat meat. Shaw said, "I don't need a reason. I don't like to eat meat, so I don't eat meat." Later, the literary association gave Shaw a set of theatrical ghost masks made of mud from the Dong'an Market in Beijing, in a brocade box, along with an ancient embroidered robe. After appreciating them, he sighed and said, "There are different roles in the play, such as warriors, old men, young men, actresses, and demons, which can all be distinguished from their faces. However, our faces are mostly the same, but our inner nature may not be similar." His words were very humorous and thought-provoking.</p>

<h3>Impressions of China</h3>
<p>Mr. Shaw left the World Society at about 3 p.m. and returned to Sun's residence on Moliere Road. He then met with reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in the garden of Sun's residence. The reporters first asked Mr. Shaw about his impressions of China on this trip. Shaw shrugged his shoulders, smiled, and said that the answer to this question cannot be fully described in one or two short phrases, just like an author writing a huge work of more than twenty volumes, which cannot be completed in a short time. Shaw said that he is seventy-seven years old this year. Whenever he arrives in various parts of the world and encounters news reporters, he must be asked this question, whether in cold or tropical regions. In fact, the phenomenon of the world is always like this. Moreover, he has only arrived in China for a short time, so he does not have a complete impression to describe.</p>
<h3>No Culture to Speak Of</h3>
<p>Secondly, Shaw also criticized the shortcomings of Chinese culture. He said that China and the East have no culture to speak of. The meaning of culture, as explained by science, is everything human behavior that can increase human happiness, especially the control of nature. In China, apart from the fields and villages, a little culture can be found, but otherwise there is no culture to speak of. Today, China is moving many so-called "cultures" from Western Europe that have lost their effectiveness and harm the public. For example, the rise of parliament is because people do not want a government. The British people used parliament, first to overthrow the rule of the emperor, and then to overthrow the authority of the church, but in the end, they never overthrew the power of capital, because it was controlled by capital. In addition, British universities almost completely destroy the individual's free will and instill outdated and useless antiques into the minds of students, making them into figures with a certain format. What will happen at a certain time, what reaction will there be in a certain situation, can be predicted and determined. What is the benefit of China moving such so-called Western culture?</p>
<h3>Oppressed Nations</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked how the oppressed nations of the East can find a way out. Shaw thought for a while and replied that it is difficult to answer the above question. It is better to wait until he leaves Shanghai before answering, because it does not seem very safe to speak here. At that time, another reporter questioned Shaw, saying that this kind of answer is of little help to China. Shaw then explained in detail, and also mentioned the collapse of capitalism, the spirit of Marxism, and the methods of the Soviet Russian revolution, talking endlessly.</p>
<h3>Describe Revolutionary Methods</h3>
<p>Once Shaw started on a question, he would talk endlessly. Therefore, from the above question of the way out for small and weak nations, he unconsciously talked about the question of revolutionary methods. Shaw said that when he passed through Hong Kong, he had instructed students to revolt, but please do not misunderstand, he did not advise students to beat the police on the street. When the police hold their guns to suppress them, the most appropriate method is to run away, and run away as soon as possible, so as not to have their heads broken and bleed. There is no need to confront the police, because the police are like a pistol in the hands of a robber. We never want to confront the pistol when we encounter a robber, but we want to defeat the person holding the gun. This requires organization and planning, and cannot be done by brute force. That is, if the workers strike to demand treatment, the result will inevitably be freezing and starvation. From the standpoint of socialism, I oppose strikes, but in today's environment, this method sometimes has to be adopted.</p>
<h3>Praised Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>He then said that in recent years, the internal phenomena of Soviet Russia, both spiritually and materially, have shown good and sufficient performance. This kind of large-scale progress not only benefits Soviet Russia itself and achieves complete success, but also serves as a good example for other countries to learn from, imitate, and implement. Shaw also firmly expressed his observation that he believes that socialism will eventually be universally implemented in all countries in the world. Although the means and steps of the revolution may be different in each country, they will eventually converge on the same path and become a horizontal line. As for the success of the Soviet Russian revolution, it can also be said to be due to the fact that the treatment of political prisoners in the era of the Russian imperial system was too harsh, driving those with different political ideas to Siberia, which happened to unite a group of resolute people with revolutionary sentiments and gave them the opportunity to read, think deeply, research, and organize. At that time, a Russian newspaper reporter who was present suddenly said to Shaw that what he saw in Russia when he left the country was nothing but chaos, and it was not as praised as he said. Then Shaw resolutely told him that what you said was what you saw when you left Russia in 1922, not the recent situation in Soviet Russia. If you return to the country to observe at this time (if you can still escape after returning to the country today), you will know that the current situation is very good. Judging the current Soviet Russia based on past observations, of course, you cannot know the speed of recent progress in Soviet Russia.</p>
<h3>British Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>The reporter then asked what Britain's policy towards China was. Shaw smiled and replied that it can be said that no one in Britain knows China, so there is no policy to talk about. He also said that the Lytton Report can be said to be fair, but it is too long and I am afraid that no one can read it all thoroughly. Shaw paused at this point and then said that today Britain itself has so many problems that need to be resolved urgently that it has no time to ask about China again.</p>
<h3>Need is Practical</h3>
<p>He also said that what China needs today is a good government. We must know that good governments and good officials are never welcome by the general public. Chinese politics often suffer from too much talk and no real effect. Therefore, the most needed thing is practical work.</p>
<h3>Shanghai is Very Bad</h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked what he thought of Shanghai. Shaw said that Shanghai is very bad. He also asked what he thought of the Second World War. According to the answer, we can wait for the Second World War to come. There is no need to worry about it today. They talked for about forty-five minutes. The reporter saw that Shaw was showing signs of fatigue, so they said goodbye to each other. Shaw then talked briefly with Song and others, and at 4:30, he was accompanied by Madame Sun and Yang Xingfo to the pier and took a ferry to Wusong to board the British Queen Ship. Madame Sun and others did not return home until about 8 o'clock. Mr. Shaw and his wife also set sail at 11 o'clock that night and sailed to Qinhuangdao.</p>
<h3>Weng Zhao-yuan's Letter to Shaw</h3>
<p>The British contemporary literary giant George Bernard Shaw came to Shanghai and visited the Shanghai battlefield. Weng Zhao-yuan, a famous anti-Japanese general, specially asked Yin Zhiling to represent him in welcoming him and presented him with a copy of the English-language "Memoirs of the Bloody Battle of Shanghai" and sent a letter to Shaw saying, "Dear Mr. Shaw, I am pleased to hear that you have come to China and visited the site of the January 28th Shanghai War. I am sorry that I cannot accompany you because I am away from Shanghai. I would like to present you with a copy of my English-language "Memoirs of the Bloody Battle of Shanghai" as a souvenir of your visit to China. I would also like you to see the remnants of the artillery fire of the strong after seeing them in person, and then read this book, so that you can know the touching and admirable situation of the oppressed people fighting bloody battles at that time. I would also like to ask you to be a contemporary literary giant, who usually vomits his blood and writes out the philosophy of mankind's love of life and hatred of death, and leads the people to embark on the road of peace. How can you know that in this world where the East and the West are competing for civilization, there are still such fierce people in the Far East who show their ferocious faces and cruel methods and regard human peace as worthless? In that case, since you have come to this place and know this situation, how much more compassionate tears will you shed for these human beings? I hope you will take care of yourself. Respectfully, Weng Zhao-yuan."</p>
<h3>The Water Cut-Off Problem is Serious</h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association Decided to Refuse to Pay Water Bills</p>
<p>Tragic Accidents Occurred in Both Pudong and Puxi Due to Water Cut-Offs Yesterday</p>
<p>Representatives of the Real Estate Association Will Petition the Municipal Government Today</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that within the Public Concession, the water company, disregarding everything, has implemented a water cut-off, which has already caused a city-wide storm. Yesterday morning, in Sanxingfang, Tangshan Road, Pudong, a death occurred due to a dispute over water after the water was cut off. In Yidingpan Road, Puxi, tragic incidents such as the explosion of steam boiler water tanks also occurred due to the water cut-off. The Real Estate Association, after a general meeting yesterday, decided to notify its members to refuse to pay water bills from now on in order to deal with the situation. The following is a record of the various situations:</p>
<h3>Representatives Attending</h3>
<p>Those who attended the meeting yesterday included companies such as Yizhongyin Company, Deli, Jingji, Jiuxing, Chengyu, Longzhang, Xingji, Central Trust, Changtai, Taili, Xinghe Business, Fenxing, Hexing, Yuji, Yude, Qinyu, Tongde, Huada, Changfeng, Renxin, Jingji, Haufeng Real Estate, Hekun Trust, Xielong Real Estate, Sanxin, Yongqing, etc., and Shenyutang, Gu Lanji, World Book Company, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Xu Xiangji, Dali Accounting Firm Real Estate Department, Zhou Gengji, Yunji, Shanghai Bank, Continental Bank, and other leasing accounting firms and real estate department representatives, totaling more than two hundred people.</p>
<h3>Important Matters Resolved by the General Meeting</h3>
<p>After the representatives arrived one after another, the meeting was announced to begin promptly at four o'clock. Chairman Kui Yanfang first gave a report, stating roughly: For forty-five years, the water company has been charging at a rate of five percent. In the past two years, they have increased water rates twice, using the high value of gold and low value of silver as a justification for the price increase. We have questioned them as to why they did not reduce water rates when silver was expensive and gold was cheap. The report by the American, Hill, who came to Shanghai to investigate, did not clearly understand the facts, so the results still lacked effective solutions. Now, the water company is using the appalling means of cutting off water, which is truly an act of murder. The mask of their being a civilized nation has been completely torn off. The partiality of the Public Works Department towards the water company is evident, as they have even sent police to protect the water shut-offs. In short, regardless of what happens, if water rates are increased again, landlords and tenants will have no way to survive. We can only strive hard to achieve the goal of abolishing meter installations, and more. Next, he reported on the progress of negotiations with various parties (details omitted). Attendees, including Shen Jixuan, Wu Wenyuan, Ye Shantao, Xiao Zonghan, Chen Chenggang, and others, successively stood up, expressed their opinions, and discussed for over two hours. The chairman summarized the opinions and resolved the following important matters: ㈠ It was decided to appoint Kui Yanfang, Shen Jixuan, Li Bohan, Guo Zusheng, Xiao Zonghan, Wu Wenyuan, Zhao Ziyu, Lu Hanting, and others to go to the municipal government together this afternoon at two o'clock to petition, requesting the Public Concession authorities to stop the Shanghai Water Company's murderous act of cutting off water supply. ㈡ Before the water company resumes supplying the water that has been cut off and sincerely seeks a reasonable and legal solution, all water fees will be withheld and not paid. A notice will be published in the newspaper to inform the real estate industry throughout the city to implement this. Finally, other matters were discussed, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Notice to Suspend Water Fee Payments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association, after a meeting resolution, published the following notice: Urgent Announcement: The Shanghai Water Company in the Public Concession, seeking unilateral benefits, disregards the affordability of the citizens and uses the means of cutting off water to coerce and collect huge and escalating water fees calculated by meter, causing citizens to face the danger of being unable to cook or drink, endangering their lives. The water company has placed the lives of the citizens outside of consideration. To alleviate the danger to the livelihoods of the citizens, this association unanimously resolved at the meeting on the seventeenth of this month that before the Shanghai Water Company resumes supplying the water that has been cut off and sincerely seeks a reasonable and legal solution, all water fees will be withheld and not paid. Because the matter concerns the lives and safety of the citizens, this urgent announcement is hereby issued. We respectfully request everyone's united assistance in implementing this. Your kind attention is appreciated.</p>
<h3>Questioning Armed Water Shutoffs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter yesterday to Zhong Siyun, the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Works Department in the Public Concession. It reads: Dear Sir, According to a letter from our member, Xie Xing Company, the main water pipe in Weishui Fang on Zhejiang Road was cut off by the British-owned Shanghai Water Company at 4:15 PM on February 13th. Four workers, two foreign staff members, and one Chinese and one Western patrolman from the police, (all wearing coats that covered the numbers on their uniforms), provided protection during the operation. Furthermore, a letter from Qin Yu Company states that at 10:00 AM on February 15th, the British-owned Shanghai Water Company dispatched several workers, foreign staff, and numerous Chinese and Western patrolmen to Qin Yu Li on Linqing Road, Yangshupu, where they cut off the water pipe in the neighborhood. Additionally, a letter from Huada Real Estate Company claims that at 12:00 PM on February 14th, the British-owned Shanghai Water Company, along with several foreign staff members and Chinese and Western detectives, cut off the main water pipe at the entrance of Shunzhi Li on Kunming Road. Furthermore, a report from Jing Ji Company states that at 10:00 AM on February 15th, the water company cut off the main water pipe in Sanxing Fang on Tangshan Road. These reports have reached our association. Given that the water issue is currently under discussion by the Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors for a reasonable solution, the water company's continued water shutoffs and refusal to reconnect the water demonstrate a lack of concern for public safety and disregard for your department, which is abundantly clear. Public opinion widely believes that your department is an agency authorized by taxpayers to protect the safety of their lives and property and must step forward to correct the water company's arbitrary behavior to fulfill its due responsibility. In the past, the water company often claimed that the water shutoffs were approved by your department. The public generally regarded this as a pretext for the water company to shirk responsibility. In light of the aforementioned three water shutoffs, where Chinese and Western detectives were present on site, it is clear that the water shutoffs are being implemented jointly by the police, or at least those with the authority to command the patrolmen, and the water company. This situation is causing the public to mistakenly believe that the patrolmen are acting as the water company's police, rather than protecting the safety of taxpayers' lives and property. If this is a misunderstanding of the latter kind, the harm is relatively small, and it would be sufficient for your department to issue a formal statement and investigate the patrolmen involved. However, if it is a misunderstanding of the former kind, it will lead people to suspect that the patrolmen are the water company's police, not those who protect, but rather those who destroy the safety of taxpayers' lives and property. In that case, those responsible for the harm caused by the water shutoffs will include not only the water company but also others. Regarding the information provided in this letter, we hereby request that you, Director-General, provide a clear response to avoid public misunderstanding and prevent the water issue from becoming even more complicated. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<h3>Urging the Director-General to Reflect</h3>
<p>Hou Xing Real Estate Company sent a letter yesterday to the Real Estate Association, stating: Yesterday, we received your instructions and learned that our company's houses in Weishui Fang on Zhejiang Road are paying water fees according to a water-inclusive contract. We have repeatedly requested your association to urge the water company to collect the fees on a monthly basis and stated that the company should be responsible for any delays. Later, we sent the water fees for June to November, calculated according to the signed water-inclusive contract, totaling 1,336.5 taels of silver, to the company, which accepted it and issued a receipt as proof of the contractual arrangement. This is a common practice for both Chinese and foreign parties. However, on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, the Public Works Department sent police to forcibly cut off the main water pipe together with the water company, disregarding the lives of the citizens. Was the Public Works Department established to maintain local security, or is it a profit-making agency for the water company? Director-General Jones's one-sided hearing and defense are baffling. May we ask, who is the Director-General being paid by? Please forward all past correspondence regarding the negotiations, as well as the payment of water fees and the reminders we sent, to the Director-General for his review, so that he can immediately reflect and start thinking about the citizens' welfare.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Fatal Injuries</h3>
<p>Following the water shutoffs by the water company, two cases of fatal injuries occurred yesterday morning in Pudong and Puxi, respectively. The circumstances are as follows: ㈠ In Sanxing Fang on Tangshan Road, Pudong, the entire neighborhood consists of 107 buildings, with a population of over 2,000, mostly working-class residents. Recently, the neighborhood's water supply has been cut off. Residents have been taking water from the public tap to sustain their lives. However, yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, a resident of the neighborhood, Jiao Liang, a woman from Tianjin, suddenly got into an argument with a woman from Shandong over water. The argument escalated into a physical fight, and the woman from Tianjin severely injured the Shandong woman in the head and waist. Onlookers apprehended the attacker and handed her over to the police. The injured woman was taken to the hospital for treatment. Her injuries are said to be severe, and her life is in danger. ㈡ At number 62 and a half on Yidingpan Road in Puxi, a family surnamed Mou experienced a sudden burst in their water heater tube yesterday morning due to the water company's water supply being cut off without prior notice. A maidservant died on the spot. It was a tragic event.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Association's Stance</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: The Shanghai Special District Citizens' United Association sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association, stating: Dear Sirs, Lately, the water fees calculated by meter in the concession are several times higher than the previous rates calculated based on house rent, with some even exceeding the rent. Landlords are unable to afford the increased costs when they are responsible for payment. Similarly, tenants (i.e., users) who pay directly are also unable to afford it. As a result, those who pay insist on paying according to the old system, while those who collect fees insist on collecting according to the new system. The subjective differences in sending and returning fees have made it impossible to resolve the issue. The Public Works Department, as the responsible party, must consider the interests of its constituents and the interests of the water company, seeking a legal, reasonable, practical, and feasible solution. However, the water company is impatient and, together with the police, has cut off the water pipes in Weishui Fang on Zhejiang Road and other areas, causing users to face the danger of being unable to cook or drink, a matter of life and death. If the Public Works Department fails to quickly stop this, it will inevitably raise suspicions of collusion with the water company. If both the payer and the collector of fees go to extremes and do not consider the difficulties faced by the third-party users and the agency responsible for maintaining the safety of residents' lives and property, the serious events that may result will be even worse than those caused by Director-General Lu He's oversight. This association believes that water is fundamentally different from telephones, electric lights, streetcars, tap water, and public buses. A lack of the latter does not lead to death, while a lack of the former makes survival impossible. Therefore, this is not a dispute between the water company and the tenants, but a dispute between those entrusted by the residents and the water company. If those entrusted disregard the interests of the residents and allow the water company to strangle them for money, the problem will become extremely serious. It has already evolved from a simple water fee issue into a highly complex issue of trust. Society will have its own judgment on whether the directors of the Public Works Department have made an effort to address the case. However, it is unwise not to correct the water company's recklessness and to allow it to wait for a resolution. This association believes that municipalizing the water supply would be a fundamental solution, while continuing to pay according to the old system would be a transitional measure. Based on the resolution of this association, we hereby request your association to authorize the Public Works Department to proceed quickly.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Reconsiders</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced that the Public Works Committee held a meeting several days ago to discuss the issue of installing water meters. During the meeting, the Director-General reported that, as a result of repeated consultations between representatives of the water company, Chinese groups, and personnel from the department, the water company had drafted a proposed alternative solution to reduce the burden on poor users under the meter system and eliminate opposition to the universal installation of water meters. After careful consideration by the committee, the report was presented to the Board of Directors on Wednesday of this week. The Board of Directors also discussed the matter in detail. Due to the need for careful study, no decision was made at that time. It was decided to reconsider and decide at the next meeting.</p>

The Living Weekly Society forwarded a total of 50 yuan donated by Jia Yunqu, Jia Jinzhe, Gao Bingheng, Dai Guiqiu, Yang Zishi, Jia Jianyuan, Yang Jinbo, Wang Gefu, Jia Tongfen, Wu Dai, Wang Yemao, Xiong Lisheng, Li Huadi, Chen Yushu, Bu Zhousheng, and Qian Shulan from the Yisheng Company in Hai'an, Taixian County.</p>
<p>Lawyer's Proposal: Lawyers Zhao Ji, Guo Qiming, Gu Gongbing, and eleven others jointly sent a letter to the Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association, stating: Dear Sirs, At the meeting of our Bar Association, many colleagues proposed to donate money to purchase aircraft to resist foreign aggression. However, our Chinese talent for flying aircraft is quite lacking. It is not possible to use them without a long period of practice. Moreover, various groups are actively raising money to purchase aircraft. It would be better to donate the money we raise to purchase anti-aircraft guns, which could immediately resist enemy aircraft. Our opinion is that, for the sake of protecting local security in the rear, we must also raise money to purchase anti-aircraft guns to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Four Postal Workers From the Suifenhe Area Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Subjected to Abuse by the Japanese When Leaving the Northeast</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: Our country's post offices in the three northeastern provinces were occupied by the puppet state. In July of last year, the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal districts were successively closed to show resistance. At that time, the eastern part of Jilin (Suifenhe) and the Daheihe area of Heilongjiang were still occupied by righteous armies led by Ding, Li, Ma Zhanshan, and others, covering an area of over 700 li, with over 100,000 troops. Therefore, to facilitate communication for our righteous armies, our authorities decided to allow the 18 offices in the Suifenhe area and the 6 offices in the Daheihe area to continue operating as usual. The Ministry of Communications allocated several thousand dollars each month to provide assistance. The salaries for these two areas were paid until December of last year. Due to the repeated suppression of the righteous armies by the Japanese army, the postal workers in the two areas suffered greatly. As Ding, Li, Ma, and other units successively retreated to Russian territory, the remaining 24 offices could no longer continue to operate. They obeyed the order to withdraw. Some of the staff members risked taking the Chinese Eastern Railway and arrived in Shanghai one after another. However, the offices along the border, fearing interception by the Japanese, gathered in Vladivostok and took a route back to China. Those who arrived yesterday on the Russian ship "Lofsky" included Wang Zhongquan, the director of the Suifenhe office (with five family members), Zhang Sheng, the director of the Wuyun office (with two family members), Sun Shiyan, the director of the Chikht office, Zhang Chunxiang and Zhang Hengzhi, the assistant directors of the Daheihe office (each with two family members), and two messengers. There were also 13 people from the Suifenhe Customs and 3 staff members from the radio station. They said that they were subjected to abuse by the Japanese when leaving the country and were almost intercepted. Also, the remnants of Ding, Li, and Wang Delin's troops on the Chinese Eastern Railway line are still moving about unpredictably. When the war begins, many righteous armies in the three provinces will take the opportunity to rise up again.</p>
<p>Whether our opinion is appropriate, we ask the public to decide. Yours sincerely, Ge Zhaoqi, Guo Qiming, Gu Gongbing, Zhang Zanrong, Yan Dajue, Huang Yuping, Feng Buqing, Li Yiming, Liang Bohua, Wu Chengyu, Li Junhuan, and others.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gu Zhutong's Transfer to Gansu is Not True</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Will Return Soon</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. In the afternoon, reporters visited Chu at the Sino-French Institute of Technology and inquired about the Executive Yuan's recent affairs and Wang Jingwei's whereabouts. Their conversation went as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Chu said that the Executive Yuan had not yet received Gu Zhutong's second written reply. The rumor that Gu had been transferred to Gansu and that Shao Lizi would be in charge of Jiangsu Province is not true. Mr. Shao is in Nanjing, and I have met with him. Although he has expressed his intention to resign, the central government still hopes that he will abandon this idea and return to his post soon. As for President Song, I called his residence and was told that he had not received a telegram. He will probably return soon. The mission of Mr. Song's trip has been reported in the Tianjin and Peiping newspapers for several days. One is related to finance, and the other is that Song is taking this opportunity to inspect the social conditions in North China. If Mr. Wang has left Lyon, he will likely arrive in Shanghai by the fifth or sixth of the next month. He will definitely take an Italian mail ship, as it is slightly faster than ships from other companies. The Executive Yuan has increased the navy's budget. As for the plan to develop the Northwest that I proposed earlier, the issue has been handed over to the National Economic Council by the Central Political Committee. In the future, we will probably need to convene a meeting of business leaders from the Northwest provinces in Nanjing and then discuss how to proceed. As for the Sino-Japanese issue, the rumor that Japan has issued an ultimatum to China on three fronts is completely false. Moreover, the central government has never received such a document. As for Japan's intention to withdraw from the League of Nations, this is probably just intimidation. However, in my personal opinion, if Japan can rein itself in at this time and end everything, even if it withdraws from the League of Nations, it may not be detrimental to Japan. If it continues to act arbitrarily, even if it does not withdraw, I fear that it will eventually offend the public and only Japan will suffer.</p>
<h3>Chen Xunyong Transferred to Shanghai to Defend</h3>
<p>Chen Jiliang Will Inspect Operations in Jiangyin</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that Chen Xunyong, commander of the naval training fleet, was originally in the capital in charge of defending the river surface. He has now been transferred to Shanghai by order of the ministry. He arrived in port yesterday morning at 11:00 AM on the Tongji warship and docked at the Gaochangmiao Wharf. In the afternoon, Mr. Chen went ashore to the naval headquarters to meet with Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet. They had a long conversation and exchanged views. It is reported that Chen Jiliang will go to Jiangyin soon to command this year's naval spring exercises, while Chen Xunyong will be responsible for the defense of Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Committee to Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers from All Walks of Life previously initiated the formation of a delegation to comfort the troops and decided to attend the comfort activities.

It is also reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to go to the Northeast to comfort the Anti-Japanese soldiers, requires a large number of comfort items. Yesterday, it sent letters to the wheat flour industry, mercerized cotton weaving industry, Chinese soap industry, new medicine industry, cigarette factory industry, knitting industry, rubber manufacturing industry, biscuit candy canning industry, enamel industry, thermos bottle manufacturing industry, and various domestic goods factories, asking them to donate to the best of their ability within their respective business scope. If it is necessary to purchase goods, please give a special discount to facilitate collective action and boost morale.</p>

<h3>Party and Government Organs Mediate Huangpu Steamer Dispute Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Voice Agency reports that the British Taikoo Company's expulsion of Wusong steamer workers has not been resolved. Recently, they intend to continue this method to deal with the Huangpu steamer, which has aroused the indignation of the workers on the steamer. They demanded the Chinese Cabin Public Office to find a way to stop it. Representatives of the Chinese Cabin submitted a petition to the Social Bureau yesterday. Party and government organs immediately sent personnel to mediate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition for Prevention: After receiving the request from the Huangpu steamer workers, the Chinese Cabin Public Office sent five representatives, Zhou Xiaoting, Qian Ziyun, Xu Yingsu, and others, to the Social Bureau at 11 am yesterday to petition for the prevention of disputes on the Huangpu steamer. Tan Peiyan, a mediator from the Third Section, received them and promised to report to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Seamen's Special Party Headquarters to find ways to stop it.</p>
<p>Workers Confer: Representatives of the Chinese Cabin on various steamers of the Taikoo Company's Yangtze River route, and representatives of various cargo handling departments, considering that the Wusong case has not been resolved, and now the company intends to use this method to deal with the Huangpu steamer, then it is expected that this method will be gradually used to deal with other steamers. For the sake of their own interests, a joint discussion on countermeasures was held at the Chinese Cabin Public Office at 26 Jiuxiaochang Road in the city at 10 am yesterday. The result of the discussion was to unite and actively respond.</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation: According to the request of the Chinese Cabin representatives, and because the Huangpu steamer will set sail tonight, the Municipal Party Headquarters dispatched Zhou Lianze, the chief of the Civil Training Section, the Social Bureau dispatched mediator Tan Peiyan, and the Seamen's Special Party Headquarters dispatched Xu Shiqi to mediate at 3 pm yesterday. According to the compradore Du Benchu, the company originally wanted to reduce the number of workers to twenty-three, but after negotiation, it agreed to reduce it to thirty. Party and government representatives then requested him to negotiate further, striving to employ as many workers as possible, and ordered the workers to board the ship and work first, and wait for a solution.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Organizations Hold Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Representatives of Disaster Victims in Zhabei Disaster Area Petition for Relief</h3>
<p>Sun Guixiang, Shen Musan, and other seven representatives of the victims in the Zhabei war zone, carrying petitions, went to the Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao at around 10 am yesterday to see Mayor Wu, requesting him to forward the petition to the War Zone Relief Committee for relief. Section staff Lin Yannan received them, and promised to forward the representatives' appeal and provide relief within the possible scope. The petition reads: "Submitted for the sake of disaster victims who are still displaced and have not had enough to eat, we hereby jointly and tearfully beg for relief. The representatives have petitioned repeatedly, and had no choice but to go to the government seven or eight times, appealing to the difficulties in person. We received three distributions of two or three liters of rice per person from Mr. Wang Binyan during the Lunar New Year, which shows the kindness to the disaster victims, and we benefited a lot. However, considering that each family has two people, how many people can be fed with such a small amount of rice, and how many people can survive? Although there is little porridge and many monks, the disaster victims are all singing praises. However, suffering frequently invades, and the spring is cold and the winter is harsh, and there is a shortage of food. The misery of water and fire is even deeper, and the tragic situation is unbearable to describe. The representatives hereby risk offending and submit this petition again, begging to distribute a small amount of relief money to each household to alleviate the suffering. We will be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee."</p>
<h3>Datongxing Yintai Bank Establishes Special Current Account Department</h3>
<p>Yintai Bank, a member of the Ningbo Road Money Industry Association in this city, has been established for many years and has a good reputation. Recently, it has been observed that since the January 28th Incident, the industrial and commercial circles have suffered heavy losses. To revive the economy, it is necessary for the financial sector to cooperate fully. It is heard that after moving to its new location, the bank has established a special current account department to meet the above needs and changed the old practice of not opening current accounts without a street runner. At the same time, it has added time deposits. Regardless of the industry, anyone can open a current account with the bank without an introduction. The procedures are very simple. At this time of commercial decline, it is indeed good news for the industrial and commercial circles.</p>

<h3>First Soviet Merchant Ship Arrives in Shanghai After Sino-Soviet Resumption of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Flying the Chinese Flag Upon Entry</p>
<p>Carrying 66 Passengers</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's business team has been recovering. Soviet merchant ships will first open the Shanghai-Vladivostok route. Although three chartered ships arrived in Shanghai last month, they were not regular ships of the team. Now, the team has specially dispatched the merchant ship Sharovsky for the first time, which sailed from Vladivostok to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to enter the port on the afternoon of the 16th, but was delayed due to fog and changed to enter the port yesterday morning. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, it was inspected by the authorities as usual. The ship also flew the Chinese flag upon entry and sailed into the Huangpu River, stopping at the 92nd buoy. The ship is 375 feet long and has more than 2,000 tons. There are 66 passengers who came from Vladivostok, and hundreds of tons of cargo were loaded. It is verified that the ship is the first Soviet merchant ship to arrive in China after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Press Figures Hold Farewell Dinner for Luo Fo Yesterday Evening</h3>
<p>Luo Has Served as the Head of TASS in Shanghai for Six Years</p>
<p>His Successor, Cai Nash, Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Luo Fo, the head of the Far East Branch of TASS, has served in China for six years. He has now been transferred back by the agency and will be appointed to an important position. His successor, Cai Nash, has already arrived in Shanghai. Luo Fo is about to leave. Zhang Zhuping, Dong Guangxian, Wang Yingbin, Pan Gongbi, Xiong Shaohao, and others from the Shanghai press hosted a farewell dinner for Luo at the Bank Club last night. Those invited included former Foreign Minister Chen Youren, Markhof, the head of the Russian Commercial Delegation Office who arrived in Shanghai three weeks ago, TASS Grass, Zhang Yunhe from Shen Bao, Wang Boqi and Wang Zhongwei from Xinwen Bao, Tang Liangli from Minzhong Luntan, Li Bingrui from Gonghe Zhoubao, Zeng Xubai from Da Wan Bao, Jiang Guangtang from Tianjin Yong Bao, and Zhang Si, the former Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Xu, etc., raised their glasses, talked and laughed, and the host and guests were extremely happy. Halfway through the banquet, Zhang Zhuping rose and delivered a speech, saying, "It is a great honor to have the distinguished guests here today. This is the first time that the Chinese and Russian press circles have gathered together after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia. We have been wanting to have a good chat with you for a long time, but due to the busy newspaper work, we have neglected social contacts. Now that Mr. Luo Fo is about to return to his country, we have the opportunity to meet with you. We sincerely hope that those present tonight will expand the spirit of the joint celebration, so that the friendship between the two peoples will increase day by day, and we will support each other and develop business." After Zhang finished speaking, Luo Fo stood up and gave a reply in Russian, which was translated into English by Markhof, saying, "It is a great honor to be invited to participate in this grand banquet today. I wish to follow Mr. Zhang's words and congratulate the friendship between China and Russia on becoming closer and the development of business is promising. I also hope that after returning to China this time, I will have the opportunity to come to China again one day to continue the old friendship with everyone."</p>
<h3>National Arts Circles Host Public Banquet for Ma Liang</h3>
<p>Chairman Zhang Zhijiang's Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, Wang Ziping, Yu Zhongnan, Ma Zhongnan, Ma Haishan, and other representatives of the Central Guoshu Institute, totaling more than 70 people, held a public banquet at the Building at 24 Weihaiwei Road at noon yesterday for Ma Liang, the newly appointed General Counselor of the National Government. Tao Jianhua and others invited him to take a seat. Zhang Zhijiang was elected as the chairman and delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Our country is lagging behind others in everything, which has led to a weak country and poor people. Only Guoshu (National Arts) is becoming more and more prosperous. Recalling the end of the Qing Dynasty, all circles unanimously despised martial arts, but General Ma Zizhen, regardless of the opposition from all parties, shouted loudly and vigorously advocated it, which has led to today's achievements. General Ma has foresight and is worthy of admiration. Colleagues should follow General Ma and continue to work hard to popularize it among the 400 million compatriots, which is the foundation for a strong country. There is great hope," Next, Ma Liang gave a reply, saying, "The prevalence of Guoshu in the past ten years should be attributed to the enthusiasm and efforts of Director Zhang Zhijiang. I really dare not take the credit. I am very honored to be invited to this banquet by you all. I have three feelings. ㈠ The Japanese are pressing closer, which is unreasonable. I hope that compatriots will unanimously study Guoshu, every family will prepare a big knife, and everyone will prepare a walking stick to defend themselves, which is easy to do and can also prevent thieves. ㈡ Empty talk about promoting domestic goods cannot make up for the facts. Taking cigarettes as an example, most of the raw materials are foreign goods. The annual consumption is more than 98 million yuan. If this amount of money given to foreigners is used to run agriculture and industry, more than 9.8 million yuan of thieves, beggars, and vagrants can be reduced every year. In less than five years, the country will naturally become rich and strong. Therefore, everyone has the responsibility to save the country. ㈢ There are many Chinese and Western hospitals, pharmacies, and doctors in the country, but hospitals, pharmacies, and doctors for saving injuries are still rare. In this autumn of internal and external troubles, according to the proposal of Comrade Tao Jianhua, I have also had this idea for a long time and plan to actively carry out this matter. I hope that all circles will give guidance." Finally, 20 of Ma's subordinates performed various martial arts and dispersed.</p>

<h3>The Wuhan Branch of the Women's Temperance Association Works</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Women's Temperance Association sent Ms. Cao Fengxiang, the director of the Central China region, to Wuhan last winter to organize a temperance branch, the colleagues of the association have spared no effort in carrying out the association's affairs. In addition to persuading people from all walks of life in Wuhan to abstain from smoking, drinking, gambling, and other bad habits, they have also worked hard on various relief efforts. The association's purpose is pure and has won the trust of people from all walks of life. Recently, it was heard that the chairman of the association and others, in view of the fact that the Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting hard in the frozen and snowy weather, specially donated large sums of money to make silk cotton vests, cotton socks, and straw shoes to send to the soldiers at the front, to fulfill their national duty as citizens.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province's Exhibits for the Chicago Exposition Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry's Preparatory Committee for the Chicago Exposition hired Mr. Dong Kunfan as the special commissioner for soliciting exhibits last September, the Fujian Preparatory Committee for the Chicago Exposition was established and began to solicit exhibits. Up to now, more than 4,000 exhibits have been received, including lacquerware, horn combs, paper umbrellas, tea, paper, porcelain, shiitake mushrooms, tobacco, silk, antiques, carvings, wood, bamboo, and other manufactured products and natural objects. Among the lacquerware, the products of the lacquer workshop of the Huieryuan Orphanage are the most distinctive, divided into three categories: ㈠ Improved daily necessities, that is, daily necessities for eating, drinking, sitting, and sleeping, and stationery, etc. In terms of materials, they are different from ordinary lacquer merchants. ㈡ Fine arts and crafts, such as Guanyin, Shouxian, Ruyi, coral, etc., and can also be lacquer models. ㈢ Among the cultural propaganda products, there are statues of ten famous people in ancient China, including the Yellow Emperor, Leizu, Confucius, Laozi, Wang Yangming, Yue Fei, Qi Jiguang, Lin Zexu, and Sun Yat-sen, all about two feet high. The above-mentioned famous people have made great contributions to the country and mankind. Now, the orphanage can make statues of their relics and promote national glory. This kind of work is truly commendable. It is verified that the orphanage was established in the spring of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922). At that time, the Minyue wars were raging, and natural and man-made disasters continued, and the social economy was completely bankrupt. Poor children were displaced. The founders of the orphanage, Mr. Shen Yonghao and Mr. Dong Kunfan, saw this situation and resolutely rose up to take on the task of saving the declining social economy. They jointly planned to establish educational institutions and began to organize the orphanage, running around and appealing, and operating in a difficult situation. After ten years of struggle and continuous efforts, there are now more than 180 students in the orphanage. The orphanage covers an area of 100 acres, including farms, forests, workshops (including lacquer, rattan, bamboo, sewing, and sericulture departments), classrooms, dormitories, libraries, etc., a total of more than 50 buildings. In addition, there are lacquer sales yards and trade departments. Dozens of students have graduated, and some talented children have been sent to major universities and specialized schools in China, as well as to naval and military academies, and have graduated and served the society. There are also more than 20 students studying outside the orphanage. It is verified that in the early days of the orphanage, the orphanage was narrow and the equipment was extremely simple. All the items in the orphanage were taken from the homes of the two gentlemen. It can be imagined that the two gentlemen worked hard to what extent at that time. This time, Mr. Dong served as the special commissioner for soliciting exhibits in the province. Because the matter concerns international honor, he is extremely enthusiastic. The first batch of items was personally brought to Shanghai by him and two graduates of the orphanage, Wang Hongci and Chen Chengzhang, a few days ago. They are now living in the Chicago Exposition Office, personally arranging the exhibits on the spot, day and night. This kind of enthusiastic and responsible spirit is truly a rare talent. As for the second batch of special products, it is heard that they will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Maritime Palace</h3>
<p>Changxing Company's Civilian Empress of Britain</p>
<p>The First Giant Ship Imported After Shanghai's Opening to Trade</p>
<p>丨The Luxury and Splendor of the Ship Cannot Be Described丨</p>
<p>The world-cruising ship Empress of Britain, which was taken by the great British writer Shaw, arrived at Wusong at 6 am yesterday. The ship is Changxing's new ship and the first giant ship imported since Shanghai's opening to trade. Yesterday, the company invited people from all walks of life to visit the ship. The reporter also went to observe it. Its greatness and magnificence are truly the queen of the ocean. The situation is divided into the following:</p>
<h3>Great Ship Body</h3>
<p>Since Changxing Company built the 36,000-ton Empress of Japan in the Pacific Ocean the year before last, it has added the 42,500-ton net tonnage Empress of Britain in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship cost about 60 million yuan in Chinese currency, and the total displacement of the ship is 63,000 tons. It was launched on April 16 last year. The interior decoration took several months to complete. The machine is the latest style of diesel oil engine. Because of the great speed, it uses 60,000 horsepower and can travel 27 nautical miles per hour. There are three white painted chimneys on the body. There are 20 decks on the cabin, and there is an aircraft platform for adding when the voyage is official. The maiden voyage after completion is to travel the world and come to Shanghai. Because the ship is too large and eats too deep, it has to berth in Sanjiashui.</p>
<h3>Rich Content</h3>
<p>The layout of the ship's content is so rich and beautiful that it cannot be described in words. The great hall, smoking room, secondary room, etc. of the first-class room are in European style, with granite as the pillars, metal carvings, and the most valuable velvet carpets on the floor. The Chinese style is like the Swastika chair, all made of Quan wood and painted with Fuzhou's famous lacquer. There are countless ancient Chinese porcelain antiques, and there are also many famous paintings. The electric lights in each room use various kinds of hidden lamps, but emit light and do not see the lamps. The glass garden and dance hall are even more dazzling. The library, writing room, swimming pool, gym, tennis court, dining hall, etc. are far more luxurious than the major Pacific Ocean ships. People who enter it really have the feeling of being dazzled and brilliant.</p>
<h3>Cordial Reception</h3>
<p>This time, the ship's reception of visitors from all walks of life takes a strict approach. The company issued few invitations. At 2 pm, the Victoria ship was specially released to carry about 100 Chinese and foreign people who visited the ship. At 3:30, they arrived at the ship. The owner of the ship sent personnel to lead them to visit various places. The good management method of the whole ship shows the perfection of the travel settings, so that those who travel long distances have the joy of enjoying the scenery and no feeling of being isolated. At 4:30, the shipowner served tea and snacks to the guests. At 6 o'clock, they left the ship and returned to Shanghai by small steamer. It was already 8 pm when they arrived.</p>
<h3>Tourist Itinerary</h3>
<p>The 240 members of the world tour group who arrived in Shanghai by this ship were divided into Group A and Group B. Group A arrived in Shanghai at 9:30 AM, and Group B arrived at the port at 10:00 AM. Changxing hired 100 cars to guide them around the city. Group A toured the city and the Chinese area in the morning, while Group B visited the City God Temple and other places in the afternoon. By 5:00 PM, they all gathered at the Astor House Hotel. At 6:30 PM and 8:00 PM, they took the "Scott" and "Alexander" ships in two shifts to return to Wusong and board the big ship. However, because Mr. Shaw Desmond was welcomed by our side and time was limited, Changxing was asked to arrange a special small steamer at 10:00 PM at midnight to send Shaw on board. Therefore, the ship changed its departure time to 12:00 PM to leave Shanghai for Qinhuangdao.</p>
<h3>Grand Lecture by Master Yuanying at the World Buddhist Laymen's Association</h3>
<p>At the World Buddhist Laymen's Association on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, Venerable Yuanying, the executive director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was respectfully invited to lecture on the Universal Gate Chapter of the Lotus Sutra Avalokiteśvara every afternoon at 2:00 PM from the 15th of this month, for a total of sixteen days. Although the spring rains were late and lingering, the gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life who went to listen to the lecture were extremely enthusiastic, so much so that there were no empty seats. The director of the association, Wang Yiting, the deputy director Wang Binyan, the directors Guan Jiongzhi, Li Jingwei, and the guests Wang Shaohu, Shen Binlun, and Yu Liaoweng all attended the association to listen respectfully. The master's voice was clear, and his analysis was detailed, and all the listeners were satisfied. It is expected that when the weather clears, the audience will be even more crowded.</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Operation of Sightseeing Buses on Two Routes</h3>
<p>Currently Not Yet Implemented</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that two routes would operate discounted sightseeing buses under the order of the Ministry.</p>
<p>According to news from the transportation sector, the road bureau has repeatedly discussed this matter, but due to various unresolved issues, the realization of the plan will have to wait.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bank Safety Deposit Vault Adds Safety Deposit Boxes</h3>
<p>Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road originally had a safety deposit vault, equipped with more than 4,000 of the latest style safety deposit boxes. The vault is lined with half-hour thick steel plates on all sides, top and bottom, and the outer walls are up to eighteen inches thick. The vault door weighs fifteen tons. The construction is sturdy and unmatched in the country, and the rental fees are extremely low, so it was already fully rented out long ago. Those who came later often regretted being unable to secure a box. Last winter, the bank built a new safety deposit vault, with equipment identical to the original vault. At the same time, it purchased more than 2,000 safety deposit boxes from the United States. They have now been installed and are ready for use. The new boxes come in various sizes, and the rental fees start at four yuan. The number of people renting them has been very high in recent days.</p>
<h3>Star Theater Donates to the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The American-owned Star Theater on Qingdao Road, in view of the brave resistance of our Northeast soldiers against the enemy, showing boundless respect, but facing the isolated army fighting in a remote area, facing a powerful enemy advancing by land and air, with depleted ammunition and food, urgently needing supplies, the Shanghai Chinese movie theaters such as Central, etc. have already begun to voluntarily contribute. In order to take the lead in foreign movie theaters donating to the Northeast, the theater held a charity performance yesterday, donating all the proceeds from yesterday's ticket sales, as well as the shares of the staff, except for the film rental fees, totaling 113 yuan, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, to do its part.</p>
<h3>Reconciliation in Lawsuit of 111-Year-Old Li Fangxiao</h3>
<p>The case of Li Fangxiao, a 111-year-old man, suing Feng Mingzheng, the manager of Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, for infringing on his reputation, was heard in the Fifth Division of the Shanghai Special Court at 2:00 PM on the 17th. The plaintiff's agent, lawyer Wu Kaisheng, and the defendant's agent, lawyer Yuan Jingtang, detailed the process of reconciliation between the plaintiff and defendant after the court's instructions. The judge advised both parties to be courteous, withdraw the lawsuit, and make peace, thus achieving reconciliation. As a result, the rare lawsuit between a 111-year-old man and a young man in his twenties came to an end.</p>
<h3>A Retelling of the Multiple Robberies on Lunar New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>One Robber Arrested and Shot Dead on the Spot</p>
<p>One Robber Injured, Interrogated Only Yesterday</p>
<p>On January 25th of this year, which was Lunar New Year's Eve, all the stores large and small in Shanghai were closing their accounts as usual, so those collecting debts were on the road all night long. A gang of robbers took advantage of this time to commit robberies. On that evening, from 7:30 PM to 8:15 PM, within those forty-five minutes, as many as four robberies occurred in the Beichengdu Road and Datong Road area of the Xinzha district alone. Not to mention other places, here is an exploration of the circumstances of the four robberies: The robber Deng Dahongzi, from Jiangbei, also known as Gao Xiaomao, specialized in forming gangs in Shanghai to commit illegal acts. He had been arrested multiple times but remained unrepentant. Recently, he became acquainted with Wang Zhaodi, a woman also from Jiangbei, and lived with her on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. Last Lunar New Year's Eve, Deng gathered his accomplices Jiang Weili, Shen Laosan, Dai Xiaohuaizi, Damao, and others to secretly plot a robbery. However, because carrying weapons was inconvenient, they entrusted his mistress Wang Zhaodi and Liu Dama to be responsible for transporting the weapons to avoid the attention of patrols. At 7:30 PM in the evening, the seven men and women set out together. When they reached the Chenjiabang vegetable market on Avenue Haig, Wang Zhaodi handed the guns and bullets to the group and waited near the alley entrance. Deng and the others first entered Wan Da Xin Sauce Garden at No. 377 Datong Road, took out their guns, and threatened them to be silent. They robbed eighty yuan in large and small silver coins from the counter and fled with the loot. They then went to the nearby Sen Tai He Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 786-7, robbing 125 yuan in paper money. As they were fleeing, the shop assistant shouted "Catch the thieves!" The group fired three shots in the air to show their power and escaped. However, they were still not satisfied and went to Gu Changsheng Rice Shop at No. 617 Beichengdu Road, robbing 300 silver dollars, and then to the neighboring Tong Ren Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 613, where an unfortunate incident occurred, otherwise, there may have been more than just these four cases. At that time, it was exactly 8:15 PM. There were many customers outside the counter of the store, and the shop assistants were too busy to attend to them. Suddenly, a thief jumped into the shop, took out his gun, and threatened them. He grabbed one hundred silver dollars from the drawer in the counter and jumped out of the counter with the loot, telling his accomplices who were on the lookout to flee south. Shen Zisheng, the shop owner, caught sight of him and quickly followed behind. Seeing the three thieves fleeing to Jing'an Temple Road and turning to Tongfu Road, Shen immediately reported to the Chinese policeman No. 3125 at the station, saying that the three people opposite were thieves and asking him to arrest them. However, the policeman felt that he was alone and afraid of alerting the snake, so he did not dare to take action rashly and also followed them secretly to observe their movements. After walking about 300 yards, a special Western policeman No. 83 happened to pass by. The Chinese policeman immediately informed him and asked him to arrest them together. Unexpectedly, the thieves were extremely alert and secretly noticed that there were police officers following behind. Deng Dahongzi immediately fled south, while the other two thieves fled north. The Chinese and Western policemen also chased after them separately. Chinese policeman No. 3125 closely pursued Deng but was unable to catch him for a while. Seeing that Deng seemed to want to resist arrest, he immediately raised his gun and fired five shots in a row. Deng fell to the ground in response. He was shot in a vital area and died instantly. The special Western policeman No. 83 turned to pursue the other two thieves, who also fired four shots in the air. Before long, the thieves disappeared. The policeman then helped the Chinese policeman to carry the thief's body to the mortuary for examination. When the Western policeman fired his gun, one of the thieves, Jiang Weili, was shot in the leg and fled in pain. That night, he returned to his home at No. 8 Yucheng Lane, Qiwupu Road, Yangshupu. Xu Bohua, who lived with him, telegraphed the Yulin Road police station in charge of the area, which sent detectives to arrest Jiang and transfer him to the Xinzha police station for questioning. Jiang also admitted to the robbery. The police chief, considering that his injuries were quite serious, sent him to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, he sent Chinese detective Ding Huaguo, Bao detective Zhou Jinshan, and Western detective Bai Naituo to investigate the case. On January 31st, Wang Zhaodi, the mistress of the deceased Deng Dahongzi, and Wang Xiaoerzi (i.e., Li Desheng), a suspect, were arrested at the Hongqiao in Xihua Road, Hongkou, and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation pending further questioning after Jiang recovered from his injuries. Jiang's injuries have now healed. Yesterday morning, the police sent Jiang and the two Wangs to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special Court. The police summoned the victims of the robbery to court and presented the above situation in detail through police lawyer Wang Yaotang, stating that Wang Xiaoerzi was not related to the case and should be released first. After the trial, the police still need to request an extension because a robbery case had also occurred in the Yulin Road police station area. At that time, the thieves fired a gun. Afterwards, a shell was found and sent to the Public Works Department's Gun Inspection Office for verification. It was found to be the same as the bullet fired by the robber gang in the Sen Tai He robbery case on Datong Road.</p>
<p>Subsequently, representatives from each of the four victims arrived to testify about the robbery. Jiang Weili was questioned and claimed that he had sent vegetables to Deng's place in the afternoon, wanting to borrow money from him for the New Year. Deng told him to stay and go with him. At 7:00 PM in the evening, he followed the group out, but he did not know that they were going to commit a robbery. Wang Zhaodi testified that she carried three handguns for the thieves, from Route Lafayette to the Xiaocaichang vegetable market to commit the robbery. After the robbery, she still carried the handguns for them. Jiang Weili was indeed an accomplice at the time. After verification of the statements by Judge Qian Wenji, it was ordered that Wang Xiaoerzi be released first. Jiang Weili and Wang Zhaodi were detained pending further questioning on another date.</p>
<h3>Wing On Company Wins Rent Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Last winter, Wing On Company filed a lawsuit against Lang Jingji, a tenant of Minfeng Lane on Jiujiang Road, for prolonged rent arrears. The judgment was handed down, and the company appealed. The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has now ruled that Lang should repay six months of rent, totaling 450 taels of silver. The request for eviction was rejected because a public letter was sent by the Shanghai Municipal Government to the former Provisional Court in March of the 17th year of the Republic of China, stating that lease contracts of foreign merchants that do not specify a term should use the solar calendar. The lease contract between Wing On Company and Lang was established years ago and has always used the lunar calendar to record rent. Both parties should still be bound by it, so the respondent is ordered to pay rent according to the lunar calendar. Therefore, Wing On Company won the lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of Li Yushan's Case</h3>
<p>Yin Geru Can Sue as a Shareholder</p>
<p>Yin Geru, a shareholder of Shashi Textile Co., Ltd., subscribed for 10,000 yuan of shares when the company was founded. He then mortgaged the shares to the Chongming Datong Bank for 3,000 yuan. At the end of last year, Yin decided to sell the shares. Through the introduction of Li Yushan, the general manager of Shashi Co., he sold them to Zhang Yunxuan, a tea merchant in Hankou, for the same price of 10,000 yuan. On the day of the transaction, Yin accompanied a friend to the Shashi Co.'s Shanghai office in Sanhe Lane, Jiangxi Road, to complete the transfer procedures. At that time, his shares had already been sent to the office by Datong Bank. Li ordered the accountant to pay over 3,000 yuan of Yin's mortgage principal and interest to Datong Bank. The remaining 6,000 yuan was given in Shanghai Bank promissory notes. After Yin accepted the promissory notes and handed them to his friend to take away, he suddenly asked Li to issue the dividends and interest for the three years since the yarn factory was established. Li believed that this was creating unnecessary problems and refused the request. Yin also refused to stamp the transfer seal on the shares. A conflict then occurred. Although Yin was reconciled by others and stamped the seal, he hired lawyer Ma Shouhua to file two criminal lawsuits against Li Yushan: (1) accusing Li and Yu Yingle of assault, and (2) accusing Li of embezzlement. The assault case has already been judged by the First Special District Court, sentencing Li and Yu to a fine of 50 yuan each. In the embezzlement case, Yin, as a shareholder, has filed four charges, which have also been heard twice by the First Special Court. Initially, there was hope for reconciliation, so only a brief hearing was held. Now, however, the path to reconciliation is full of thorns and impossible to proceed. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi reopened the trial. The defendant hired lawyers Qin Liankui and Xi Yafu to defend him. Judge Wu first rigorously examined the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's shares had already been sold, that the shareholder's rights had been lost, and that the shareholder's qualifications had naturally disappeared, so he had no right to sue. He then re-examined the facts of the conflict over dividends on the day of the transaction. After the plaintiff Yin Geru and the defendant Li Yushan each stated the situation on that day, Judge Wu believed that the shareholder's transfer procedures on that day had not been fully completed, so the plaintiff could still sue as a shareholder. He then ordered Yin Geru to state each of the four charges one by one. Yin then stated the facts of the first charge, saying that the defendant Li Yushan forged the name of Yan Deji (i.e., Dexiu) and embezzled 43,532 taels, one qian, and four fen from the company, which was obviously false. The defendant then answered this charge, and Li Yushan then stated that Yan Dexiu was also a shareholder of the company and a director. He was originally a shareholder and manager of the Tongxin Money Shop. Because Yan owed my Wanfeng firm over 43,000 taels of silver, and Shashi Co. owed Tongxin over 80,000 taels, Tongxin was affected by the current situation and stopped operating. Yan was unable to repay my debt at once, so I agreed with Du Shaoru, the chairman of Shashi Co., and other directors to transfer the account from Shashi Co. and noted under the name of Yan Deji that I would be responsible for this debt. If it could not be recovered in the future, I would still repay it. When the board of directors met in June last year, I reported it to the board of directors, and it was approved by all. The current board of directors met on February 10 and changed the name of Yan Deji to Li Yu Ji, with a fixed date for repayment. The above process was not only approved by the board of directors, but also ratified by the shareholders' meeting. The plaintiff's accusations are not true. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant embezzled over 40,000 taels of the company's funds. After the matter was discovered and questioned, it was only transferred to Yan Deji's name at the end of February of the 20th year. The board of directors' ratification was on June 22nd of the 21st year. Please pay attention to the timing. At this point, because it was necessary to summon witnesses, the trial was adjourned to February 27 for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Indictment for Policeman Shooting and Killing Someone on False Charge of Robbery</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Believes Policeman Disregarded Human Life</p>
<p>Jiang Boxian, a local from Xingju Lane, Nanhui Hall Road, organized a bidding club. Zhou Ronggui, a small owner of a Qinglong Bridge noodle shop, went to bid and won a round. Jiang thought that this round was paid for by Zhou's wife, so he asked for a guarantor. Zhou then gathered two hoodlums to coerce him and take the money away. Jiang's wife, Jiang Wu, went out and reported it to policeman Liu Sendong of the First District, First Precinct. Without asking the reason, he raised his gun and shot Zhou in the head, killing him. Now, after the review by the District Court Prosecutor's Office, the policeman is considered to have disregarded human life and violated Article 282 of the murder law. Jiang Boxian and Jiang Wu are accused of falsely accusing him of robbery. A public prosecution has been filed requesting a heavy sentence. The Criminal Division is currently reviewing the case.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Thanks British Military Officers</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department believes that Major M.R.C. Penney and Major A. Mason of the British Army stationed in Shanghai have been diligent in protecting the area. Especially during the martial law at the beginning of last year, their cooperation in maintaining order was greatly appreciated. Now that the two officers have been transferred away from Shanghai, the Director-General Zhong Si sent a letter to Major General Fleming, commander of the British Army, and another letter to the two majors, respectfully expressing gratitude.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Bank Announces Regular Recruitment of Trainees</h3>
<p>Those who pass the review will be issued an exam certificate.</p>
<p>Those who do not pass the review will have their documents returned.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, located at No. 64 Hankou Road, is expanding its business and needs more staff than it currently has. Therefore, it plans to recruit trainees to assist in operations. Details have been published in previous newspapers. It is known that more than 250 male and female students have gone to the bank to register according to the registration procedures. They have already been reviewed separately. Those who pass the review will be issued an exam certificate, and those who do not pass will have their photos, diplomas, and other documents returned. The bank has scheduled the examination dates from February 25th to 27th. It is heard that the remuneration after being hired ranges from four to twelve yuan per month. This time, the number of people admitted will be about five or six men and three or four women.</p>
<h3>Wu Chongjing's Boat Was Hit, Killing People. Request for Compensation</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the boat owners in Wu Chongjing, Pudong West, reported that the Ningbo ship and the Taiping ship collided, crushing Wu Chongjing's boat and killing many people on the spot. Yesterday, he sent letters to both companies and the Ship Inspection Department of the Customs, requesting compensation and condolences, stating that my people's boat is stationed in Wu Chongjing, Tangwan Town, Shanghai County, and travels back and forth to Shanghai every day, docking at the guild hall wharf in the southern city. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 AM on the 9th of this month, when the tide was rising, just as it was about to return to the countryside, it was suddenly hit by the Ningbo ship of Taikoo Company and the Taiping ship of Zhongwei Company, causing the boat to be turned sideways and crushed to pieces. Among the more than 20 passengers, some were crushed in the abdomen and drowned, including Sun Guanxi and Zhang Awu. Lu Weisheng was seriously injured, and there were still six or seven people who had not been recovered. Once the bodies and their families are identified, a supplementary report will be made requesting condolences. The people's boat is a boat that provides convenience to the countryside, transporting goods and passengers every day for a living. Now, it has suddenly suffered an accident. Not only were the boat and goods completely destroyed, with losses estimated at over 3,000 yuan, but many people were also injured and killed, leaving their families with no means of livelihood. In addition to waiting for the identification of the families of the victims and requesting to reserve condolences, the water patrol team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has already investigated and recorded the case. A special document is prepared with a list of losses, hoping that the authorities will forward it, order prompt compensation, to benefit the boat owners and care for the lives of the people.</p>
<h3>Northeast Students Staying in Peiping Will Run Out of Food</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation for the Relief of Northeast Refugees received a telegram from the Peiping Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang Relief Association yesterday, stating that the Northeast students staying in Peiping have set up a simple cafeteria. Director Qu had previously telegraphed to request assistance, and we are grateful for the donation of rice and flour, which has allowed the Northeast youth to survive. However, the two Northeast colleges, the Northeast University and the Northeast College, have a total of 1,262 Northeast refugees. Because it was easier to raise funds at that time, no cafeteria was established. However, since the tension in Yuyu, the donations have been few and far between, and the situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable and will soon run out of food. If relief is not considered, they will inevitably be displaced. After repeated negotiations with the simple cafeteria, it has been said that they are unable to cope. Considering the situation, it is necessary to provide relief to the Northeast refugees in the same way to prevent them from having nowhere to turn and becoming starving corpses. It is estimated that about 5,000 yuan of rice and flour expenses are needed per month, calculated for six months, totaling 30,000 yuan. Graduates in the summer vacation will be provided with other arrangements, and further assistance will be sought for those who continue their studies. Current relief efforts cannot be delayed. We dare to state the difficult situation and respectfully ask the comrades of the congress to propose and fully support the cause. We hope that it will not be regarded as an ordinary fund-raising effort, which is what we urgently hope for. We also hope to receive a reply.</p>
<h3>China Aviation Corporation's "Nanjing" Plane Safely Flew to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The "Nanjing" aircraft of the China Aviation Corporation, which operates the Shanghai-Hankou route, took off from Hankou eastward on schedule at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, when it was about to fly to Jiangyin, due to a sudden downpour of rain and fog, it was unable to fly and immediately landed on the river surface there. The pilot, Norris, also stayed overnight on the Yingrui warship. At 7:40 AM yesterday, he still flew the original plane from the Pudong surface of Jiangyin and safely arrived in Shanghai at around 9:00 AM, without any damage and without any passengers, carrying only 150 pounds of mail.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Labor Dispute at Da Jin Silk Factory</h3>
<p>Each person receives a severance payment of 95 yuan.</p>
<p>Injured receive medical expenses of 250 yuan.</p>
<p>After the entire workforce of the Da Jin Silk Factory on Xietu Road, Nanshi, had a dispute over the dismissal of workers, personnel were dispatched by party and government agencies to mediate. Yesterday, labor and management reached a resolution in consultation with the city party headquarters. The agreement is recorded as follows: At 10:00 AM on February 17th, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Hou Xuecheng and other workers of Da Jin Silk Factory resolved the labor dispute with the company in the city party headquarters as follows: (1) Hou Xuecheng, Ma Ruxian, Ma Shanhai, Ma Yaohai, Zhang Nancheng, Zhao Xingen, Xu Zuyuan, Xu Zuyao, Wu Aquan, Ma Fuquan, and other ten people are allowed to be dismissed by the factory, and each person will receive a severance payment of 95 yuan from the factory.

The above three items have been agreed upon by both parties, and the record of settlement has been signed on the spot as above. Witnesses: Zhu Guilin, Zhang Dafu.</p>

<p>Weiting Central Elementary School Initiates the "Wu County Children's Aircraft"</p>
<p>Last year, all teachers and students of Weiting Central Elementary School enthusiastically supported the Northeast Volunteer Army. In total, over four months (starting from October), the children and teachers saved their daily allowances and collected a total of more than forty yuan. The school principal already remitted this amount to the Shanghai Volunteer Army Support Association for transfer to the Northeast. Although this year's winter vacation was short, the children of the school, realizing that the work of national salvation cannot be interrupted, decided to donate all of their Lunar New Year lucky money and candy expenses during the vacation. According to recent statistics, the amount obtained is over twenty-five thousand yuan. After collective discussion, it was decided to temporarily conclude the efforts to aid the Volunteer Army. Starting in February of this year, all children in the school will voluntarily save money daily, and teachers will contribute one percent of their salaries to initiate the fundraising to purchase a "Wu County Children's Aircraft" bomber for national air defense. However, because this is a major decision, a circular will first be sent to all elementary schools in Wu County to proceed uniformly, and a request will be submitted to the Wu County Party Headquarters, Party Government, Education Bureau, and Education Association to request leadership and organization to complete this endeavor as soon as possible under unified command.</p>
<p>Fujian Education Department Improves Middle School Standards</p>
<p>Dividing into Two Methods: Addressing the Root Cause and Treating the Symptoms</p>
<p>Recently, in order to improve the standards of middle school students, the Fujian Education Department divided into two methods, addressing the root cause and treating the symptoms, to actively improve the situation. ⑴ Addressing the root cause: Starting from this semester, urge all middle schools to rectify the academic atmosphere, strictly enforce training, improve teaching, and expand equipment to ensure that middle school education cultivates the backbone of the Chinese nation. ⑵ Treating the symptoms: ⑴ Organize a textbook research committee for primary and secondary schools: In order to improve the efficiency of primary and secondary school teaching, this committee is specially organized to guide the adoption of textbooks in primary and secondary schools in the province based on the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and to investigate and review textbooks and supplementary teaching materials for various subjects. ⑵ Improvement of the unified examination method: According to the unified examination questions in previous years, the standards were based solely on the school graduation course. This method has caused many malpractices. It is now changed to formulate test questions based on the middle school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education and the subjects taught over three years. ⑶ Formulate regulations for unified examinations for normal schools and vocational middle schools: In the past, unified examinations were limited to ordinary middle schools, and normal and vocational schools were not included. Even the Ministry of Education did not set unified examination rules for these types of schools. Director Zheng believes this is also necessary, and it is said that detailed rules are being drafted. ⑷ Plan to set up college preparatory classes: In order to remedy the academic level of previous graduates, college preparatory classes will be held in the provincial capital. It is said that the regulations have been drafted and submitted to the provincial government for approval.</p>

<p>Instructions on Matters Requiring Attention from Various Schools</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued the following instructions yesterday to schools below the secondary level in the city: It is found that all faculty and staff should be responsible for health education in schools. For the sake of convenience, physical education teachers in each school should be responsible for guiding and planning physical education in the entire school.

These orders must be followed. This order.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Requests Early Promulgation of "Children's Day Song"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Education yesterday for the early promulgation of the "Children's Day Song" and a clear order stipulating that schools be closed for one day on Children's Day, stating: In March of last year, this bureau submitted a request to your ministry to create a "Children's Day Song" and issue it to the whole country for singing. We received your ministry's instruction No. 3159, stating that the submission was noted and that the song had been collected by various departments. However, as this year's Children's Day is approaching, it is too late to issue the song, and the Party song can be used temporarily at that time, and we were instructed to comply. We have already complied with these instructions. This year's Children's Day is approaching in a flash. If this song has been created, we request that it be issued as soon as possible so that we can instruct rehearsals. Also, there are no clear regulations regarding whether schools should be closed on Children's Day. According to the facts, it is difficult to have classes on that day. May we request that your ministry inform all primary schools and kindergartens throughout the country to close for one day on Children's Day to hold various activities in order to unify the practice. We have submitted this document for your review and instruction.</p>
<p>Municipal Elementary Schools Increase the Number of Classes</p>

<p>Baoshan Education Funding Granted Exemption from 10% Discount</p>
<p>Since the Baoshan County education funding was affected by the January 28th Shanghai Incident, income has sharply decreased. Therefore, a 10% discount was applied to the funding for bureaus, schools, fields, and museums. Subsequently, Director Feng of the Education Bureau repeatedly explained the difficult situation to the Education Department and requested permission to waive the discount. Now, the Education Department has issued instructions for approval, so the bureau has issued notices to various schools. The original order is recorded as follows: It is found that since the bureau, schools, fields, museums, and other expenses have been issued at a 10% discount, the situation has been extremely difficult. We requested that the discount be waived starting from the second half of the year. Now, we have received the Education Department's instruction No. 720, stating that the submission has been noted. It is verified that the difficulties described are indeed factual. However, there is a need to reduce revenue after the disaster and to make special reductions in expenditures. If we only take care of the present and do not consider the future, the difficulties will be greater than today when unforeseen circumstances arise. Since repeated requests have been made to waive the 10% discount, permission is granted to temporarily waive the discount from the second half of the 21st year, but all temporary expenditures should still be greatly reduced. This order must be complied with. This order.</p>

<p>Sports Today's Western Union Football</p>
<p>3:00 PM at Yiyuan</p>
<p>Donghua vs. Agal</p>
<p>Yuyou vs. Lancashire at the China Baseball Field</p>
<p>"Locomotive" Chen Guangyao Permitted to Play Today</p>
<p>Tomorrow's International Football Match: China vs. Scotland</p>
<p>This week's Western Union football match is an important event and can be said to be the tensest period of this football season. Today (Saturday), Jinghua and Agal will meet at Yiyuan, and Yuyou will play Lancashire at the China Baseball Field. Tomorrow is also the Western Union football semi-final, with China facing Scotland. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Current Status of Western Union Division A Teams</p>
<p>Currently, in the Western Union Division A, the Donghua team has 13 wins and 0 losses in 13 games, and has never been defeated. It is currently the team with the highest voice for winning the championship. As for Agal, it has lost twice in 11 games, and its hopes seem to be less than those of Donghua, but the team's strength is well-known and it is indeed Donghua's only strong opponent. The results of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Played Wins Losses Draws Goals For Goals Against Points</p>
<p>Donghua 13 13 0 0 54 16 26</p>
<p>Agal 11 9 2 0 52 22 18</p>
<p>Western Police 10 6 4 0 38 21 12</p>

<p>Jinan 9 5 4 0 Alkali 4 20 10</p>
<p>British Navy 14 5 9 0 37 53 10</p>
<p>French Chamber of Commerce 12 5 7 0 37 44 10</p>
<p>Lancashire 11 5 6 0 31 48 10</p>
<p>Westerners Association 16 2 12 2 18 51 6</p>
<p>Yuyou Association 11 1 8 2 17 58 4</p>
<p>Today's Donghua vs. Agal</p>
<p>In the first round-robin, Donghua defeated Agal 3-1. Today's game at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM is the second round-robin match. Judging from the strength of the two teams, each has its own strengths. It is impossible to predict who will win. Donghua is eager to win the championship, so it must work harder. However, it is not yet time to rest easy, and there are many worries ahead. Today's game against Agal is one of its difficult hurdles. If it can get through it safely, the future seems to be getting brighter. As for the skills, Donghua is feared for its short passes and solid defense. Agal suffers from a loose inner defense. The forwards and midfielders are quick-footed and can run fast, making the most of their superb skills. If Donghua can prevent the enemy from penetrating easily and can break its midfielder line, then the enemy's defense is not to be feared. It will be just around the corner to defeat the enemy. The lineups of the two teams today are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Association</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Li Ning Tu Kaiyuan Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan</p>
<p>Feng Yunyou Li Yichen</p>

<p>Today's Yuyou vs. Lancashire</p>
<p>After Sun Jinshun and Huang Ruihua, famous generals of Nanhua, came to Shanghai to join the Yuyou football team, its strength has greatly increased. Chen Guangyao, the famous left winger known as the "Locomotive," has also joined the team, so the Yuyou lineup is even more consolidated. Today at 3:00 PM, they will play Lancashire at the China Baseball Field. This Lancashire is not the Lancashire of the past, but the Lancashire that has recently come to Shanghai to transfer defenses, so its strength is unknown. Chen Guangyao's skills are still recognized by the Shanghai football fans at the 8th Far Eastern Games. After several years of parting, now that he has returned, the Shanghai football fans will undoubtedly be eager to see his skills. The Yuyou lineup today is as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Guangyao</p>
<p>Wang Shusen Ye Jinming</p>
<p>Hu Youcheng Liang Guanlian</p>
<p>Huang Ruihua Sun Jinshun</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn on George Bernard Shaw by Fei Ming</p>
<p>{Use the laughter that comes with tears to satirize this great writer}</p>
<p>Among the world’s great writers whose names have been translated into Chinese and are well known to Chinese people, Maxim Gorky and George Bernard Shaw are probably the most famous.</p>
<p>BernarShaw is not translated as “Berna Shaw,” but rather as “George Bernard Shaw.” Some people think it’s because the translator is too familiar with the Chinese surname book, but in fact, it’s better to say that it’s the translator’s painstaking effort. First, “George Bernard Shaw” is smoother to read than “Berna Shaw.” Second, this great writer is a satirist with a strong Chinese flavor. Apart from his accent, clothing, and diet, his words and deeds are not like those of a mechanized European, but rather like a caricatured Oriental. The translation of “George Bernard Shaw” is a symbol of this old gentleman’s life and personality being close to the Oriental flavor.</p>
<p>Now, the great writer we admire has come to China from afar. What he brings is not opium guns and cannons to poison us, but rather a profound sense of humor that resists the darkness of the present. What should we, who are impoverished, offer to him, the old gentleman? I think there is nothing else but the boundless laughter that comes with tears surrounding him!</p>
<p>Yes, George Bernard Shaw is a humorous socialist. In order to guess the mysterious secrets of socialism, he once visited the Soviet Union regardless of everything. His relatives and friends, fearing that he would be starved and frozen to death by the "red demons," prepared a large amount of bread and luggage for him, but he refused these gifts and finally entered another new world from the flood of panic. Amidst the grand welcoming sound, the great writer witnessed everything and suddenly realized that boring slander and rumors were enough to block the wisdom of the world. So after he returned home, he wrote down his impressions of the Soviet Union as they were.</p>
<p>China is a pitiful nation that has been living in the wanton insults and slanders of invading robbers. "Barbarian nation" and "uncivilized country" are the infamous names that all imperialists have given us. Now, our great writer wants to visit China regardless of everything to see what kind of nation China is and what kind of deeds the so-called "civilized people" are doing in China.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when Mr. George Bernard Shaw and his wife came to Shanghai, it was the early spring when the winter cold had just receded. If it were in the autumn when ten thousand trees shed their leaves, we could use a Tang poem to welcome them:</p>
<p>The boundless falling leaves rustle down, the endless Yangtze River rolls on! (Note) Note: In that deep autumn when ten thousand trees shed their leaves without end, our Mr. Shaw and Mrs. Shaw stepped off the English Queen’s ship with smiles and stepped onto the territory of China, while the rolling Yangtze River corresponded with the grand laughter of the welcomers?</p>
<p>Flying Tour of the Great Wall by Hui Zhu</p>
<p>{“Flying Tour of the Great Wall” is such a magnificent and joyful thing!}</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw once said before leaving England: "After arriving in China, I will take a flying tour of the Great Wall."</p>
<p>But it was beyond expectation! On January 3rd, Yuguan fell and the Guanshan Mountains were lost! The world’s first pass, the great and magnificent symbol of Eastern history and culture that I yearned for, and the plaque of the first pass, have already been sent to Tokyo for display!</p>
<p>“Things go contrary to wishes!” So extremely disappointed! I dare not have such extravagant thoughts anymore!</p>
<p>The reality is far beyond expectation! Shenyang fell in one night, and Jinzhou was defeated in one month. Yuguan fell, and Pingjin was already in danger! Or, due to "strategic considerations," they will retreat to the south of the Yellow River!</p>
<p>But since I have arrived in the Orient, there is always a glimmer of hope. "I don’t want the war in North China to stop me from traveling.” Let’s just take a trip to Beiping and admire the cultural city of the East!</p>
<p>The public banquets and welcomes all seem to be the conditions for exchanging speeches.</p>
<p>"I will repay you with a tour of the Great Wall." So extremely clever, they hit his sweet spot. It's just a pity that these words were said at the wrong time. The Japanese have clearly occupied Shanhaiguan! At Jiukou, there is still a part of the loyal Yong soldiers sacrificing their lives! Although it is said that the Great Wall is called the Great Wall of Ten Thousand Miles, there is no need to care about a corner of Yuguan!</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun's Success by Plum Blossom Hall Master</p>
<p>{Comes from the four words "determined ambition"}</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun is a person who is not destined to be with old operas. Since the age of eleven or twelve, she has been immersed in the singing stage and dance pavilion almost every day, and constantly works hard while studying other people's strategies and tactics. It is rare to be so obsessed with opera like this lady. During this process, she once became a concubine of a wealthy family. Although life was very comfortable, she felt that it was not in line with her interests because she could not learn and sing opera every day. As a result, she was willing to leave the wealthy family with rich clothes and fine food and continue her wandering life as an actress. Her perseverance and determination are truly admirable. Zhang Eyun has repeatedly said to people: "I have been obsessed with opera for more than ten years. If I don't perform on stage in Shanghai once, I will never stop my efforts and struggles." Now she has actually achieved her goal, and the reputation she has gained is also very good. The ancients have a saying, "Where there is a will, there is a way." Zhang Eyun's success definitely comes from the four words "determined ambition." It can be seen that when a person does things, no matter how big or small, noble or lowly, as long as they are willing to set a goal and be determined to do it, there is no reason for it not to succeed.</p>

Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results, with a large number of students. Graduates are able to work in the field, which is highly praised by society. For example, the records of each lecture in the "Shen Bao" monthly magazine are taken by shorthand students from the school. Recently, the National Shanghai College of Commerce, in response to requests from various parties, specially established a Department of Journalism, hiring professors who are experts in journalism. The college recognizes shorthand as an essential skill for journalists and has listed it as a required course, inviting the inventor, Yang Bingxun, to serve as a professor. It is reported that the number of applicants from various regions is very large.</p>
<h3>Boy Hong Ronghua Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>Hong Haifu, from Huangyan West Gate, Taizhou, Zhejiang, who has been working as a secretary in the army, recently sent his fourteen-year-old son, Hong Ronghua, from his hometown to Shanghai on the Ningxing Wheel. On the 16th, at 5 o'clock, he arrived at the 16th Pier. Upon disembarking, due to the large crowds, the father and son were separated. Ronghua walked alone to the Zhaoshang Pier in the French Concession and was found by Patrolman No. 138 due to getting lost. He was taken to the police station. Detective Qi Deqing was assigned to investigate the family with the child, but it was difficult to determine the whereabouts of his father. The head of the police ordered the child to be temporarily kept at the police station, awaiting claim by relatives.</p>

The situation of Rehe's key points, as well as the Tianjin area, is clearly visible at a glance. The selling price is only one dime, making it very suitable for the general public to read. Xie Wenyi, of Wangping Street, is the agent for wholesale distribution in this city. There is also a large-scale map of the joint borders of the three provinces of Rehe, Hebei, and Liaoning, priced at six dimes.

The fourth issue of the fourth volume has now been published, featuring twelve solicited articles that are quite worthwhile. The theme of the solicited articles is "Predictions on China's Domestic and Foreign Situation This Year and a Discussion of Methods to Remedy China's Current National Crisis." At this time of severe national crisis and changing international situation, this issue of the publication is truly a good reading material for society.

The reading public generally believes that this has reached the extreme of sacrifice. Therefore, the bookstore's business has been very crowded recently. It is reported that the deadline has been extended to April 10th for readers in other cities.</p>

<h3>How to Strive?</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Chen丨</p>
<p>After reading your reply to Mr. Ren Yuewang the other day (regarding suicide), I still have some questions. I dare to ask for your further guidance, as I also harbor the thought of "suicide" from time to time.</p>
<p>I am an apprentice in a shop, living the life of a slave all day long. (I don't know how to describe this painful situation, but it is extremely painful!) Besides "suicide," what other options are there? (I also know about striving, but I don't know how to strive. Once I wage war against the forces of darkness, I immediately face the risk of unemployment, which means the risk of hunger and cold.)</p>
<p>Since you said that "suicide" is the shameful mentality of a coward, and that one should strive and wage war against the dark society, I wonder if you could tell us "how to fight."</p>
<p>Answer: Although your letter is very simple, the questions you ask are very reasonable. I will answer in general terms as follows: (1) Apprentices who want to improve their lives (as is the case with all workers) must get rid of an old concept, namely, the old concept of thinking only from the perspective of oneself or one's own interests. The current society is often in a state of opposition between one group and another. The reason why shopkeepers dare to mistreat apprentices is one manifestation of this state. For the present, apprentices should unite everyone's strength to seek happiness for the entire common people in society, and at the same time seek to improve the lives of shop assistants or apprentices themselves, and make various reasonable demands on the shopkeepers. We know that young shop assistants not only feel the hardship of material life, but also feel the urgent need to satisfy their spiritual life and cultural life, and their desire for knowledge. Apprentices should find ways to carry out this educational work themselves. If this is achieved, then there is other striving to speak of. If everyone only thinks of themselves, perhaps you will have the opportunity to escape the position of shop assistant or apprentice and climb to the position of shop owner. This is another question, which the reporter does not want to hear, nor dare to know.</p>
<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<h3>The Relocation of Ping Normal University to Xi'an Is Problematic</h3>
<p>Relocating from a Cultural Area to a Remote Area</p>
<p>The Independent Relocation Is In Fact Not Allowed</p>
<p>丨President Li Discusses How Teachers and Students Maintain a Calm Attitude丨</p>
<p>(Beiping, 17th) Since the Ministry of Education's plan to relocate Normal University to Xi'an for a thorough reorganization was announced, the education community has expressed great disapproval. According to Principal Li Zheng, the relocation news was only seen in the newspapers. If it is said that the environment in Beiping is unsuitable, then the environment in Xi'an is even worse. If the highest institution for training normal school talents is moved from a cultural area to a remote area, then food and lodging will become a problem. If the Central Government considers the peace of Tianjin and has an overall plan for education in Tianjin, it can still be done. If the independent relocation of Normal University is in fact not allowed, the teachers and students of this school will maintain a calm attitude.</p>
<h3>Soviet Culture Extended to the Farthest North</h3>

<p>Free Talk Shaw Corner (Continued)</p>
<h3>On Shaw</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>In his essay "Quintessence of Ibsenism," Shaw discusses Ibsen, saying: "People blindly adhere to some incorrect ideas (regarding religion, politics, and gender relations) and allow these ideas to control their actions, even though they are unwilling in their hearts; and Ibsen's satire is aimed at this contradictory state."</p>
<p>We believe that Shaw is similar to Ibsen in this regard. Shaw's important works all expose the errors in people's traditional concepts (and these erroneous concepts are maintained by the rulers through various means). However, Shaw is more profound than Ibsen. For example, regarding the traditional and erroneous concept of "duty," Shaw says: "Civilized people often use the term 'duty' to disguise the true face of their actions." In the play "The Man of Destiny," Shaw uses Napoleon's mouth to say: "The English always have to come up with some grand principle to justify their actions. If he wants something in his heart, he will never say what he wants... When he wants to find a new market for the manufactured goods of Manchester, he first sends out some pastors to preach the gospel of peace. But if the natives harm the pastors, the English immediately jump up and take up arms to protect Christianity; they wage war and conquer for Christianity, and thank God for the gift of occupying that new market." In plays such as "Candida" and "Widower's Houses," Shaw mocks those hypocrites who have "fulfilling obligations" on their lips but are always thinking of their own selfish interests, truly striking with every word.</p>
<p>In "The Man of Destiny," which features Napoleon as the protagonist, and "Caesar and Cleopatra," which features the Roman general Caesar as the protagonist, Shaw mocks the world's "hero worship." In Shaw's pen, the "hero" is a very foolish and selfish person.</p>
<p>At the same time, these two historical plays are also "anti-war." However, Shaw's "anti-war" plays should be primarily "Arms and the Man" and "Major Barbara." The former exposes the psychology of soldiers in commercial countries towards war: "It's fear of death that makes them fight!" The latter exposes that not only are machine guns, torpedoes, and other weapons of destruction lethal weapons, but also fine-sounding terms such as "patriotism," "religion," "justice," and "duty" are also lethal weapons.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the play "Man and Superman" contains Shaw's "philosophy," so its value is above other plays. Indeed, "Man and Superman" not only mocks the world's views on love, but also puts forward a "philosophy": "We humans are just an experimental product, a link between beast and superman, and love is just a means for nature to achieve its purpose (to superman)." Love is a great "Cosmic Force." Shaw wrote tens of thousands of words in the preface to "Man and Superman" to explain his philosophy. People who like to study love as a "philosophy" can read that play and that long preface. But don't be too happy. Because if you read "Man and Superman" twice, you will learn that Shaw may be laughing at those "love philosophers" there.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, Shaw's name has been frequently mentioned in our literary world. Several of Shaw's works have also been translated into Chinese. However, there is still very little research on Shaw. Taking advantage of this moment, if we seriously study Shaw, it may not be a bad thing.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Black Woman Seeking God (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"Good!" said the god. "This is exactly what I want you to ask me. You are a clever and knowledgeable woman. I used to argue with a servant of mine named Job; but he was truly old and truly foolish, and I had to pour the most terrible disasters upon him before I could provoke him to complain. His wife taught him to curse me and then die; I don't blame the poor woman, because I did give him terrible light after all, although I later fully compensated him. When I finally got him to argue, he became presumptuous. However, I immediately exposed his true nature. He admitted that I was superior to him. I skillfully subdued him, I tell you honestly." "I don't want to argue," said the black girl. "I want to know: if you really created this world, why did you make it so bad?"</p>
<p>"Bad?" said the skillful one. "Oh! Are you standing up to teach me to explain myself! May I ask who you are! You can criticize me? Could you create a better world yourself? Try it: that's all there is to it. Try creating a little bit of it. For example, make a whale. Once you've made it, stick an iron hook in its nose and bring it to me. You ridiculous little insect, do you understand: I not only made the whale, but also the ocean for it to swim in, that ocean, down to the bottomless depths, up to the top of the sky. You think it's easy, I guess. You think you could do this better yourself. Girl, listen to me; you have to get rid of your conceit. You can't even make a mouse, yet you stand up against me, the maker of the great sloth. You can't even make a pond, yet you dare to chat with me, the creator of the seven seas. In fifty years you will become ugly, old, and die, while my majesty will continue forever; now you are criticizing me as if you were my aunt. You think you are better than God, don't you? What do you have to say about this debate?"</p>
<h3>The Bees of the Gentleman Class</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>Shaw is a bee in British gentleman society; he has a sting, and he can also make honey; however, the honey he makes is sweet with a touch of sourness.</p>
<p>There is more than one British gentleman; therefore, when this bee relentlessly stings one gentleman, the other gentlemen think that it has not stung them, so they laugh; at the same time, the gentleman who is laughed at by others for being stung by a bee also discovers that the few gentlemen who laughed at him have been stung by this annoying bee, so he also laughs.</p>
<p>But in British society, in addition to a large number of gentlemen, there are also many people who are not qualified to be included in the ranks of gentlemen. In their eyes, these gentlemen all seem to suffer from cleanliness; their formal wear is perfectly tailored, the collar, cuffs, and chest are all ironed perfectly: white collars, white cuffs, white shirts. They are not happy to even use two fingers to pick up a little bit of dirty stuff. What an unbearable thing this is! Now, they are seeing with their own eyes that this bee is buzzing into the gentlemen's collars, cuffs, and chests to sting them, making these gentlemen helpless, making them perform many laughable strange plays; therefore, these people who are not in the gentleman class are also watching and laughing.</p>
<p>This is probably what makes Shaw Shaw.</p>
<h3>Shaw's Drama</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhao Liang Shen</p>
<p>Manly and Rickert</p>
<p>The change in British drama is undoubtedly due to Ibsen. Ibsen was introduced very early in the 1870s by Gosse (Edmund Gosse). Between 1872 and 1880, Archer (William Archer) and others translated some of his plays; in 1880 his play, a translation or adaptation of A Doll's House, was staged and performed twice a week between 1880 and 1890. In 1890 and 1891, five of his plays were regularly performed. The most notable of these five plays was Ghosts, as it was the opening play of the Independent Theatre's inauguration ceremony (on March 13, 1891). For six years, this theatre struggled for the sole purpose of presenting new dramatic forms to the public. This theatre was able to develop entirely thanks to the ambition and courage of a Dutchman, Grein (J. T. Grein).</p>
<p>Shaw was initially an admirer of Ibsen, and he was the first person in England to use the Norwegian method as the starting point for a new British drama. The performance of his Widowers' Houses (1892) was a powerful start to the new movement. To understand that Widowers' Houses completely removed the old materials and techniques, the following summary must be known:</p>
<p>(1) The characters in the play are all middle class.</p>
<p>(2) Love is not important; the problem is the evil of landlordism.</p>
<p>(3) The structure does not conform to any known plan.</p>
<p>(4) Discussion replaces mechanical structure.</p>
<p>(5) No distinction is made between the structure and the evenness of the characters.</p>
<p>(6) The characters are not traditional representatives, but merely spokespersons for Mr. Shaw's views on economic issues.</p>
<p>(7) Elaborate sets and short scenes are obviously absent.</p>
<p>(8) Traditional stagecraft is obviously absent.</p>
<p>(9) Emotionally stirring eloquence is replaced by debate.</p>
<p>(10) Limestone lighting is replaced by ordinary setups in ordinary people's normal lives.</p>
<p>From this beginning, Shaw made somewhat systematic attacks, using drama as a weapon to attack many great thinkers of his time, and also somewhat systematically promoted himself. He deliberately chose his attacks, often changing them to avoid repetition. Reading all of his plays over the years, one can reconstruct his developed social philosophy and his propaganda for social reform.</p>
<p>Speaking of literature, Shaw's dramas, in addition to breaking away from early dramatic traditions, also have other aspects; the organization of these dramas has the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the social purpose of these dramas, they should not only be performed, but also be read; not only read, but also understood. Therefore, attention must be paid to Shaw's famous prefaces, some of which are indeed longer than the plays themselves, and are still just as interesting.</p>
<p>(2) Because these dramas are intended for reading, the stage directions should be developed to stimulate the reader's imagination, constructing for themselves what their eyes cannot see; therefore, the use of narrative and description in stage directions should be promoted to the point of becoming a new literary form: the "Closet" drama.</p>
<p>(3) Without the self-recitation and climaxes of past emotions, nor the old method of dividing into acts; the drama can be divided into as many acts as needed, as long as it is not too long and does not tire the audience's attention.</p>
<p>(4) To reduce physical movement on stage, in addition to the well-known and always clichéd drawing rooms and garden scenes, there should also be a focal point of vision. Therefore, new and even strange sets and props have been invented: for example, the car used in Man and Superman in 1901; you can never say that the dentist's office used in the play is ordinary.</p>
<p>The current effect of Shaw's works is (1) to expand all possibilities in terms of material and method; (2) to encourage a group of young people to imitate him and break away from old traditions.</p>
<h3>Hallo Shaw</h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>Dear Shaw, what have you come to Shanghai for?</p>
<p>Are you here to record our colonial slaves?</p>
<p>Are you here to salute the British flag on the Huangpu River?</p>
<p>Are you here to hear the sound of Japanese guns killing people?</p>
<p>Are you here to praise our policy of non-resistance?</p>
<p>But I have to tell you:</p>
<p>Shanghai is not London, New York, or Paris,</p>
<p>Nor is it the red city of Leningrad,</p>
<p>The flags of Britain, America, Japan, and France fly proudly in the sky,</p>
<p>Clearly stating that China is just a colony,</p>
<p>Warships in the Huangpu River emit black smoke,</p>
<p>Coolies on the banks of the Huangpu River gasp for breath,</p>
<p>The blood and flesh of the weak support the authority of the strong,</p>
<p>Shanghai is such a semi-colonial city,</p>
<p>Do you feel that this is an "Unhappy drama"?</p>
<p>Let me tell you again:</p>
<p>What you said in Hong Kong is really outrageous!</p>
<p>Young people stuck out their tongues after hearing it,</p>
<p>Old people said "bullshit" after hearing it,</p>
<p>Perhaps some people even plan to be impolite to you.</p>
<p>When you arrive in Shanghai, don't talk nonsense again,</p>
<p>Because we don't understand humor,</p>
<p>And we are not allowed to speak casually,</p>
<p>I advise you to keep your mouth shut here,</p>
<p>In fact, why say more nonsense?</p>
<p>But, when you go back,</p>
<p>You have to bring back good news!</p>
<p>Just say:</p>
<p>China is not beyond salvation,</p>
<p>The waters of the Huangpu River will one day surge,</p>
<p>Washing away the darkness and authority of the earth!</p>
<h3>Talking About Shaw (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>2. Shaw's Conch Shell</p>
<p>The merit of his attitude can be proved by the following paragraphs. Herris satirized Shaw, saying that while Shaw expressed hatred for the United States, he completely copied American advertising methods.</p>
<p>"Shaw's initial propaganda was just the usual method. From the beginning, he shouted, 'Give me big carts and bugles,' but now big carts and bugles are no longer popular, so he shouted, 'Give me radio and the screen.'" When he was young and debated with others, he knew how to attach himself to elegance, so that everyone associated him with the name of a certain celebrity. I remember once when he was debating with Heinemann, he stood up and said, "Marxism is as dead as mutton. I, Shaw, killed him.'"</p>
<p>So Herris has the following wonderful satirical passage: "He (Shaw) was the first to recognize the propaganda use of sound films... At this point, his lifetime of training in lecturing gave him a great advantage. He imitated Mussolini (translator's note: I saw this movie with my own eyes) and even imitated Shaw himself, which proves that he is a very great performer, even to the extreme of impersonation; however, it seems that what he was waving the flag and shouting against when he was writing plays in middle age was impersonation. He can even criticize the merits of his acting skills, and from sound films he saw that he was getting old and his mouth was gradually becoming unsightly. From then on, he switched to radio, which could broadcast his voice around the world without raising the issue of his personal curves."</p>
<p>Anyone who has read the preface to the play Caesar and Cleopatra remembers that Shaw raised a question: Beher then Shakespeari? (Is Shaw better than Shakespeare?) In 1896, Shaw wrote a review of Shakespeare's play (when the London Lyceum Theatre was playing Cymbiline), he said: "Except for Homer, no famous writer in ancient times, including Scott, is as despised by me as Shakespeare, when I compare his mind with my own. The degree of impatience I have with him sometimes makes me feel like simply digging up his corpse and throwing stones at him, because I know that Shakespeare and the group of people who worship him can only understand this kind of visible insult."</p>
<p>But remember that Shaw also said somewhere that "he is the most under-advertised person in the world." This is one of Shaw's conch shells. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>My Personal Eight Grand Aspirations</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Now China has reached the time for everyone to swear oaths. Not only must oaths be sworn at meetings, but individuals also seem to swear oaths as well. The size of the oath is not restricted, only that it be made sincerely, because sincerity is the key.</p>
<p>Indeed, at present it is a time of chaos and war, with everyone from top to bottom terrified, and the true emperor is not yet born. Just as the three emperors of heaven, earth, and man have created a divine ox carriage, it was unfortunately all caught by Chairman Han, who does not follow the times, and then "dismissed with a smile." If things continue like this, it will certainly not end well. Therefore, the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual. We, the heavily sinful beings, must take this opportunity to make vows and swear oaths. When else? So I have eight grand aspirations. (1) I wish that all schools would be turned into dance halls. Since there are volunteer soldiers, we must also find ways to raise donations to help them, and the only way to raise donations is through dancing to have miraculous effects. Seeing that the existing dance halls are not enough, I wish to rebuild the schools, because reading to save the country has not shown unexpected effectiveness so far.</p>
<p>(2) I wish that all Chinese people would become artists. However, saving the country through art is no less effective than dancing. Unfortunately, there are still too few artists in China. It would be best if all Chinese people were artists, writers, and appreciators, everywhere. Then China would naturally be saved.</p>
<p>(3) I wish that all beings would obtain Prajna Paramita. However, some masters also say that China's demise is indeed due to the deep sins of all beings, so there should be several more meritorious ceremonies to allow all beings to finally obtain Prajna Paramita.</p>
<p>(4) I wish that all Chinese people would have a conscience. Of course, saving the country with a conscience is the most effective. If all Chinese people had a conscience, then the market for domestic goods would also be three times as profitable. The country would be saved without having to be saved.</p>
<p>(5) I wish that China's wheat would not be enough to meet the demand. It is said that because Chinese wheat is indeed not enough to meet the demand, and in order to regulate the people's food supply, Australian wheat must be transported to replace it. Moreover, Australian wheat is cheap and of good quality, so Chinese wheat should have poor harvests every year.</p>
<p>(6) I wish for floods every year. Because no dikes are being repaired this year, American wheat is not willing to be sold on credit. In order to provide relief to disaster victims, there should be floods every year.</p>
<p>(7) I wish that all rice paddies would be planted with poppies. If there is a good harvest, it will turn into a disaster. In order to prevent disasters, poppies should be planted instead, to enrich the country and increase its financial resources.</p>
<p>(8) I wish that all university students would have airplanes. Some people say that the reason why Peking University students want to "escape exams" and "have early holidays" is because they cannot each have an airplane. Well said! So I wish that university students would not have airplanes, so that they can scatter after danger, so as not to be scolded as "leaving a stink for ten thousand years."</p>
<p>The above are my eight grand aspirations. May heaven and earth truly witness these words.</p>
<p>Literature and Art</p>
<h3>Who Pities</h3>
<p>— Jiao Bu Wu</p>
<p>Silken gowns and official hats all day idle, his determination to endure hardship is different from ordinary people, who pities the days of national destruction and family demise, still taking the iceberg as Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Poison Gas (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Meng Fu</p>
<p>(2) Lewisite: Lewisite is also a type of mustard gas, and its properties are similar to mustard gas. It is a dark-colored oily liquid with a suffocating and irritating odor. It was invented by an American chemist during the late Great War and is also known as "Death Dew."</p>
<p>(C) Lacrimatory and Irritating Throat and Nose Agents</p>
<p>(1) Chloropicrin: This toxic substance is a colorless liquid, which, when vaporized, is five and a half times heavier than air and has very strong persistence. In addition to causing tears, it can also cause vomiting and irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose and throat.</p>
<p>(2) Chloroacetophenone: This toxic substance is a crystalline solid at room temperature. It can irritate the eyes and cause tearing, but the irritated eyes only need to be exposed to fresh air for a few minutes to return to normal. It is most suitable for police use.</p>
<p>(3) Dibromodimethyl ether: This is a colorless oily liquid. After vaporization, it is six times heavier than air and has weak toxicity. It only irritates the mucous membranes of the eyes and causes tears, similar to the above. Irritating throat and nose agents are mostly solid arsenic compounds, filled in explosive shells, which explode with the shells. They can be divided into extremely fine mists. Their characteristic is that they can pass through imperfect gas masks, forcing the enemy to remove the masks because of the irritation. Now, let me briefly describe them below:</p>
<p>(1) Diphenylchlorarsine: This toxic substance is a solid at room temperature. It has a fecal odor. When there is a concentration of 1/17,000 in the air, it can kill people immediately in one minute. Even at a concentration of 1/10,000,000, it can still irritate the mucous membranes of the throat and nose, like a fire, forcing people to remove the mask, and it can also cause vomiting.</p>
<p>(2) Diphenylcyanoarsine: Its toxicity is slightly the same as the former, but its properties are stronger.</p>
<p>(3) Diphenylaminechlorarsine: This toxic substance is called "Adamsite" in the American army. Its toxicity is intermediate between the first two, and its other properties are similar.</p>
<p>(D) Systemic Poisonous Agents</p>
<p>(1) Prussic acid (i.e., hydrocyanic acid): A colorless, transparent liquid with the odor of bitter almond oil. It can damage the central nervous system. If there is 0.6 grams of this toxic gas in one cubic meter of air, that is, at a concentration of 1/2000 in the air volume, breathing for one minute will immediately cause death.</p>
<p>(2) Carbon monoxide: The coal gas poisoning that we often hear about in winter is caused by this gas. Carbon monoxide is a colorless gas. If the concentration in the air reaches 1/10, one minute is enough to kill people. In wartime, it is not very important because it is too light and easily volatilizes and disappears.</p>
<p>The above various toxic substances are either immediate-acting or delayed-acting. Immediate-acting substances include phosgene and chloropicrin, while delayed-acting substances include mustard gas. The most harmful toxic substances are phosgene, diphosgene, and mustard gas. (The End)</p>
<h3>Pleasant Music</h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>Save the country, volunteer to kill the enemy, permanent resistance, save the country, recover lost territory</p>
<h3>A Frightening Adventure</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>The bright spring sunshine has already sent the deathly, gloomy winter god to another world.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding, after eating lunch on Sunday, strolled back and forth in X Park, shaking his "stick." He saw a girl coming towards him, with bright red lips, a tender white face, eyes that sparkled with youthful beauty, and a charming and beautiful outfit—instantly Mr. Ding was softened into white iron, attracted to magnetism, and only followed her. Unexpectedly, the girl also glanced at him from time to time, and finally, without prior agreement, they both sat on a bench under the cypress trees, chatted casually, and then seized the opportunity to move elsewhere.</p>
<p>"You're really bad. You insisted on entangling me here. Is your surname really Shuangmu Lin? Like Ru Fu? Where did you make a fortune?" They had just moved from the park to a magnificent hotel.</p>
<p>"It's really Shuangmu Lin, named Mei Xi, and I'm teaching at an art school now," Mr. Ding fabricated a fake name.</p>
<p>"With your elegant demeanor, I recognized you as a member of the upper class long ago."</p>
<p>"May I ask for the lady's name?"</p>
<p>"Eh! Didn't I tell you, when the time is right, you will naturally know." Then she yawned.</p>
<p>"Madam! Excuse my presumption, I want to ask you for a small favor..." His voice slightly trembled; and he reached out to stroke her pearl-like, jade-white wrists.</p>
<p>"You're too reckless! How can there be such a cheap thing in the world?" The lady suddenly left the sofa like a swift, opened the door, and pretended to escape.</p>
<p>"Ah! You misunderstand my intentions, come in and talk again, so as not to arouse the suspicion of the waiters."</p>
<p>"I said you're really bad, you still don't admit it?" she said, as if she were angry but not really. Then, with a "bang," she closed the door. With a slight smile, she went to the dressing table, pursing her lips and thinking silently, as if something were uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Please forgive me..." He was confused, so he had to accompany her with respect and caution. But "fortune favors the bold," and fortune and romance naturally favor the bold even more. From then on, how Mr. Ding used all his energy to push this "good thing" forward? Only God knows what happened! Returning home with a sense of exhaustion, Mr. Ding answered the phone, but he denied in a pretending manner that there was such a person. It turned out that when they were enjoying the so-called "ripe time" of romance, he suddenly noticed that the girl had a gold chain necklace around her neck, and the jade pendant in the middle had the four words "X Hua Xiuying" engraved on it. Later,</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>after inquiring, he found out that she was the famous Mr. X's fourth concubine. He almost got into a life-threatening disaster, so how could he dare not avoid it as soon as possible?</p>
<h3>The Unemployed Professional</h3>
<p>— Yu Lun</p>
<p>Who says Lu Xulun is not a typical college student?</p>
<p>He has paid the tuition and miscellaneous fees of one hundred and twenty-four yuan; a small teak desk, a rattan chair, and a few pieces of luggage have been transported to the dormitory of XX University. He has also put on a suit that is half new and not too old. Really, he is a newcomer in college.</p>
<p>Isn't reading a kind of profession? Moreover, college students are considered to be the upper class of society? So isn't a college student an unemployed person?</p>
<p>However, Lu Xulun is an unemployed person. The reason why he is a college student is because he is unemployed.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty-four yuan is simply nothing in the eyes of the parents of some college students, just a matter of moving their hand and signing a check.</p>
<p>"Annoying! Such a piecemeal amount. Fill in two hundred yuan for me! You can take the rest for your own use."</p>
<p>Maybe those parents said that.</p>
<p>But one hundred and twenty-four yuan was decided by Lu Xulun's father after three or four nights of thinking.</p>
<p>"A Xu's position is hard to find; after the war, all industries are declining, and agencies everywhere are clamoring to lay off employees. If he has nothing to do and stays at home all day, he won't be doing anything. Spend a hundred and dozens of yuan and let him study in college for half a year! Maybe he can gain more knowledge. Anyway, there is no need to sign a contract and must study for four years. Within half a year, maybe he can find a decent job. At that time, in addition to filling in the middle school graduation on his resume, he can also add that he studied at XX University."</p>
<p>After such thorough thinking, he prepaid his salary for the next month from the bank, paid the tuition for Xulun, and repeatedly instructed:</p>
<p>"I don't want you to wear a mortarboard, but you don't have a job right now, and you are idle every day, I'm afraid that improper behavior will occur. So I'll let you try the taste of being a college student for the time being. Maybe you will have to do something in two months, but it won't happen, the earliest will be half a year."</p>
<p>Knowing that studying in college for half a year is useless, Xulun didn't want to go, but he was unemployed and didn't have the ability to take away other people's jobs.</p>
<p>"If you don't want to, you have to be willing," he thought, and on February 6, he took on the job of unemployed professional.</p>

<h3>The Attitude a Debtor Should Have</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am a person who has not even graduated from elementary school. Last year, I was recommended by relatives and friends to work as an apprentice in a hardware store. This year, I was fortunate enough to be promoted to the position of accounting clerk. My own situation can be considered settled for the time being, but what about my family! Alas! My father's shipping business has suffered a setback and is even worse than before, resulting in many deficits. Recently, due to the matter of payment for goods, the plaintiff applied for mediation for the first time. Since my father was still out of town, he was unable to attend court. However, recently, a default judgment was made, the main text of which stated "The defendant shall immediately pay the plaintiff for the goods; the application for provisional execution is rejected, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant," etc. Furthermore, the appeal period is within twenty days. After the judgment was delivered to my home, but my father's ship was again out of town, and I am a layman in the law, so I can only ask you for advice, sir.</p>
<p>(1) After the appeal period has passed, and I am unable to pay off the debt, what will happen according to the law?</p>
<p>(2) What does the application for provisional execution mean?</p>
<p>(3) I am nineteen years old this year. Can I have the power to represent my father?</p>
<p>Please take the trouble to answer the above questions. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Yang Eqing</p>

<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>Business failure is a common occurrence. However, owing debts requires repayment, and since a deficit has already occurred, responsibility should naturally be taken. Even if the money cannot be produced immediately, one should step forward and publicly allocate all assets for repayment. If it is not enough, then establish a practical and feasible reorganization plan. Seek understanding from others. As the saying goes, "Grasp the clear thatch to walk easily," so that there is still room for re-establishing one's business in the future. If one evades in every possible way, the creditor will naturally be anxious, and the result will be resorting to law, which will ultimately not allow you to shirk responsibility. Moreover, after one's reputation is ruined, there will be no hope for the future. Regarding your father's matter, after the plaintiff applied for mediation, although he was not in Shanghai at the time, he should have stated the reason and requested an extension. Even if he did not understand such procedures, he should have gone to discuss settlement procedures after returning to Shanghai. According to the usual practice of ordinary courts, handling such cases, from applying for mediation to declaring the mediation unsuccessful, formally filing a lawsuit, and finally issuing a default judgment, takes at least four months or more. Therefore, there is plenty of room to conduct settlement negotiations. Why did he not think of this and delayed in every possible way, leading to a default judgment? Now that the case has been judged, if you disagree, you can only appeal; although the time limit for appeal is stipulated to be twenty days, you can also state the reason and request an extension. However, to be realistic, if you ask yourself and are sure that you owe someone debt, then the result of the appeal will only increase the burden of litigation costs. It would be better to give up the appeal and prepare for debt repayment. When the appeal period expires and you are unable to pay off the debt, then the plaintiff will naturally file a lawsuit requesting execution; the court can immediately approve it and seal up the property.</p>
<p>As for "provisional execution," it is a legal term, meaning that before the case is judged, the plaintiff, because he fears that the defendant may hide or destroy property, requests that the defendant's property be temporarily sealed. The difference from execution is that because the case has not been judged, if the original case cannot be established in the future, it can of course still be unsealed; moreover, the defendant can also request compensation for the losses suffered as a result. Therefore, when requesting provisional execution, the applicant must provide a considerable amount of security. As for Mr. Yang's involvement in his father's affairs, it is of course "meddling in accounts," so the matter of representation is really inappropriate; however, submitting a statement requesting an extension of the appeal period is beneficial.</p>

<h3>A Family of Scholars (Continued from XXIII)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>"Did your mother get your consent for this marriage?"</p>
<p>Daiqiu sighed and said, "I told my mother a long time ago that she doesn't need to seek my consent for engagement matters anymore. I am willing to marry anyone. Whether he is as poor as a beggar, as ugly as a living ghost, or as old as a longevity star, I am willing to marry him. Marrying out is better than staying here."</p>
<p>Youzhong smiled and said, "These are words of resentment. Do you hate to leave your mother so early?"</p>
<p>"How can anyone be willing to leave my mother? If my mother remains a widow for the rest of her life, I am willing to remain unmarried for life and stay with her until she dies."</p>
<p>"Then, you hate me! How can I eliminate the hatred in your heart?"</p>
<p>Daiqiu said with a bitter smile, "What does it have to do with you? It's not your turn for me to hate you!" As she said this, her voice was choked. Youzhong wanted to say something more, but Ruohua was already calling his name outside.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the day of great joy for the Xia family's second house. Lamps are hung and decorations are displayed, making it very lively. Sang Aqiang specially took a day off from work and cleared out the wall gate room to allow the Xia family to make arrangements. The Zhao family sent over the betrothal gifts, including pearls, diamonds, and jewelry, everything that was needed. The relatives and friends who saw it were all satisfied. In the afternoon, the coal merchant led a handsome young man in Western clothes to pay respects to the mother-in-law, and the relatives and friends again praised him one after another. Ruohua carefully scrutinized the son-in-law and found him more and more interesting.</p>
<p>(12) You are a murderer!</p>
<p>Today, the Xia family is even more lively than when Zhongnan held the funeral! All the related relatives have arrived, except for Xia Tai Tai's nephew Zheng Jiping. He felt unspeakable sadness in his heart and naturally could not bear to attend Miss Xia's wedding banquet. Ruohua was very dissatisfied with him because of the last incident and did not bother to think about him anymore.</p>
<p>Youzhong happily entertained the new son-in-law and introduced him to Miss Daiqiu. Daiqiu met her fiancé and was teased by the guests, which embarrassed her to the point of tears. Xia Lao Taoye, Bodong, saw her shy and hesitant posture and could not help but stroke his beard and laugh.</p>
<p>The evening banquet was over, and the new son-in-law wanted to get up and leave. Youzhong, in order to connect the feelings of the new in-laws, insisted on keeping the son-in-law to play cards. After eight rounds of cards, the guests had already dispersed, leaving only the two matchmakers dozing off and waiting. Ruohua also asked the son-in-law to have a midnight snack before letting him go back. The new son-in-law bid farewell and went out. Youzhong personally escorted him to the gate. The road was as dark as lacquer. The matchmakers accompanied the new son-in-law to the alley entrance to get on the carriage. After only taking a dozen steps, they suddenly heard a gunshot. A person fell in response to the sound. In an instant, people were in an uproar. The coachman at the alley entrance took a light and came in to illuminate. Everyone was shocked to see that the one who was shot was the new son-in-law!</p>
<p>The two matchmakers: Upon hearing the gunshot, they turned around and fled. Hearing the gunman running over, they were so frightened that they huddled together, daring not to look up. Hearing others exclaim, they walked over to take a look. In the dim light, they saw the new son-in-law lying in a pool of blood and were so frightened that they trembled all over. Their limbs were powerless. Someone blew a police whistle, summoning a newly awakened policeman into the alley. Seeing that a person had died, the sleepiness that had been clouding the cop was frightened away. Another whistle blared, summoning three or five patrol police to help. They took control of the people in the dark alley, asked about the situation, and then went to knock on the Xia family's gate. The tailor-secretary asked clearly before daring to open the door. They accompanied them in to knock on the inner gate. By the time Youzhong rushed outside, the new son-in-law's spirit had already left the ghost gate and drunk Meng Po soup. Youzhong still ordered the coachman to send the corpse to the hospital and sent a messenger to the Zhao family to report the news. The two matchmakers were taken into custody by the police, who said they were suspected of murder.</p>
