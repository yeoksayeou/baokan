<p>時評</p>
<h3>事尚可爲晦</h3>
<p>熱河以五十八萬方里之廣大面積。而十日之間。竟淪亡於兩師圑兵力之敵軍。其爲不戰而退。自某放棄。不言而喻。及至近日。始有孫殿英部與敵激戰於圍塲一帶。且有力圖反攻承德。恢復熱河之傳聞。吾人遠道聞之。誠不勝其欣幸稱美孫軍之勇。然亦早料其以一部分之軍隊。孤懸塞外。赤峯承德。皆屬敵方。烏能曠日持久。自昔驅飢軍作戰。一時激於忠義者固亦有之。然卒皆無補於國家大局。今孫軍果亦以退守多倫聞矣。</p>
<p>是故我國。如自願敗退也則已。設猶欲恢復失土者。允宜急起突擊。乘被迫各軍尚在勉力苦戰。敵方駐足未定之際。迅速發兵馳援。與關外各軍前後夾攻。敵方此時守承德部隊。僅第八師圑之步兵一旅。騎兵一旅。而可以應援者。最多不過第六師圑全部及騎兵第四旅圑而已。即以原有東北軍舊部當之。亦足紛碎敵軍而有餘。故今日奮勇前進。不稍瞻顧。此策之上者也。否則繞道張北。充分接濟現正與敵相持各軍。一方嚴扼古北口。一方令抗戰各軍。集中多倫。隨時進攻。徐圖恢復。用我古拙之長。發揮步兵狙擊最大性能。敵方無交通之便。有被襲之危。如能長久撑持。縱不能規復熱河。至少可以保持平津。鎭定華北。亦尚不失爲中策。若惑於敵方轟炸恫嚇之宣傳。與沿長城劃設中立區之狡計。捨此二者不爲。一旦多倫入於敵手。抗戰各部。又蹈蘇馬覆轍。恐察省勢危。華北更陷險境。眞策之最下者矣。</p>
<p>日本爲完成其軍國主義的侵略起見。不惜露骨公言日本將擴張軍備。揭破日内瓦軍備縮小會議之面具。日本之增加軍備。觀其本年度務算軍費。已可共知。其所以又向國聯通知者。蓋以熱河雖得。防守不易。侵擾平津。猶不能不豫籌地步也。吾人試察熱河形勢。一覽地圖。即知大興安嶺過其東北。而七老圖山脈。由大興安嶺發脈蜿蜓而南。在熱河中部爲最高地。復渡長城。成灤河溪谷。直入渤海。向東傾斜。爲［南滿］平原。向西傾斜。爲冀魯冲積地。據此地形。如我能扼守熱河。鼓行而東。順地勢東行。收回東北。爲勢甚易。不幸而熱河爲敵所有。則彼可順灤河以制灤東。居高俯視。河北危矣。故自熱河失陷之後。攻守易勢。敵方已處於有利地位。然猶幸察哈爾尚在我手。［多倫］猶能制敵方側面。設使我國能及時振作。沿邊設守。集重兵於多倫。於最短期内。解决内外蒙古以往各問題。則側擊熱河。恢復失地。亦非必不可能之事。總之坐失東北。旣誤於前。放棄熱河。復誤於後。現在朝野。皆應痛自反省。萬不宜再蹈前失。亦不必徒責不堪責之人。務須即時奮起抗戰。一切任何犠牲。皆所不辭。方能制止敵人不斷的進攻。而免國家於危亡。今日所得平津各電。似已决定一致抵抗。中國更新之一綫生機。其視此歟。</p>

<p>塔斯九日日内瓦電軍縮會議政治委員會今日再討論英國之軍縮提案、即提議由歐洲國家發一共同宣言、正式廢止以武力解决所有國際爭端者、委員會已决定一包含英國提案之公式、因是蘇聯代表杜夫加里符斯基特乘機重申上月李維諾夫所發表修正英國提案之意見、杜氏先表示贊助波斯代表所主張以該宣言之規定推及於歐洲以外國家之意見、嗣謂蘇聯代表堅决反對將國家分爲歐洲者與非歐洲者之二等級、使前者必須在任何情形下不用武力、而使後者僅須遵守凱洛公約之紙面條文、杜氏云、因此宣言、余恐凱洛公約不僅不能提高其力量、且反贬低、蘇聯代表旣不願加入、亦不能爲此種劃分國家爲二羣之必然悲慘結果負責、蓋蘇聯之意見、以爲此項宣言、必普遍推廣於所有非歐洲國家、始能無害於凱洛公约、而收充分之政治效果云、</p>

<h3>日人目中之美海軍大演習之戰略意義（一續）</h3>
<p>（伊藤正德）</p>
<p>七所謂［大西洋艦隊］</p>
<p>以上所说的不過是考察時局及平時戰略等的大槪、要打算討論將來的戰略方向及戰術意義、自然得向其他方面觀察去、關於第一期的布哇攻守演習的研究、我們得到二個線索、</p>
<p>（Ａ）日本在上海戰略之實施及其對策、</p>
<p>（Ｂ）大西洋艦隊之活用及其宣傳、此外在全部演習裏最顯現的是、</p>
<p>（Ｃ）獲得制空權之一部、</p>
<p>茲先對前兩者（Ａ及Ｂ）加以觀察：</p>
<p>規定布哇羣島被敵人占領、是爲試練將來眞的占領島嶼戰及海陸軍協同作戰的一個前提、參加這個假想戰的攻擊軍、便是向來爲衆人注目的大西洋艦隊、其編制如次：</p>
<p>美國艦隊侦察部隊（俗稱大西洋艦隊）旗艦奥嘉斯太號（一○·○○○噸！八吋砲）航空戰隊四中隊、</p>
<p>Ａ巡洋艦部隊</p>
<p>第二巡洋戰隊丨敏非斯號、摩普耳號、利却蒙號、突靈頓號（以上七千　六吋砲）偵察機八架、</p>
<p>第四巡洋戰隊丨却斯泰號、喏桑浦登號、蘋塞克號、（以上均爲一萬噸大巡洋艦）偵察機十二架、</p>
<p>第五巡洋戰隊丨支加哥號、雷斯威號索爾特號、希却號（以上均爲一萬噸大巡洋艦）偵察機十二架（旗艦支加哥號、修理艦斐斯特號）</p>
<p>Ｂ驅逐艦部隊</p>
<p>旗艦拉雷號、航空戰隊二中隊、第一·第二·第三·第七·第八·第九等各戰隊丨計二十六隻（均爲一千二百噸以上航洋艦）第十九隊豫備隊丨十五艘（中型）</p>
<p>Ｃ航空偵察部隊</p>
<p>旗艦拉特號（九·五五三噸丨二七機）空軍嚮導艦拉蒲英號、桑突白波號、泰耳號（搭載飛機八至十架）戰鬭機十八架（屬旗艦）偵察機九架（同上）索敵機一二架（屬拉蒲英艦）補用六架（此外尚有三十八機歸嚮導艦斯灣號統制）</p>
<p>以上就是所謂大西洋艦隊的總兵力、即由大巡洋艦七隻（一○·○○○噸八吋砲、）七千噸輕巡洋艦四隻、一等驅逐艦二十六隻、二等驅逐艦十五隻、航空母艦及給養艦四隻、航空機八十三架所組成、現在正在建造中的大巡洋艦不久即將完成亦將編入此隊、而將第二巡洋戰隊編入其他隊中、其威勢之大、已可想而知、</p>
<p>八上海事變的試演</p>
<p>此次演習、以蘇拉突嘉號及列新頓號二大航空母艦替代空軍部隊、巡洋艦方面則將輕巡洋艦除掉、將一萬噸艦七隻编入第四第五巡洋戰隊内、艦隊速力達三十節以上、航空軍方面則有美國海軍的精鋭部隊動員、如蘇拉突嘉號母艦、（三萬三千噸三三節）及列新頓號（噸數同上）均各載戰鬭機三八、偵察機十二、爆炸機一八、及其他十架、合計每艦載七十八架、兩艦則共載一百五十六架飛機、其他各巡洋艦各載四架、共廿八架、再加上直屬的給養艦所載的、共計不下二百五十架、這是多麽有力的航空戰隊的大集合、占領了布哇的敵軍應付此項反攻的戰隊、自己的實力怎樣呢、（甲）海陸二軍的航空部隊、（乙）潛水艦、（丙）海陸協同軍、兵力的内容有海軍機一一一架、陸軍機一二零架、陸軍一、師陸戰隊若干及美國潛水艦部隊第四戰隊、即Ｓ級的潛水艦（一○○○噸上下）十九隻、二千噸以上者四隻、（此四艦爲航洋潛水艦）所組成、不知其爲偶然、抑爲故意、布哇攻守戰的規模實和上海的中日戰遥遥相對、如在（甲）以巡洋艦爲主力（乙）使陸戰隊活躍（丙）利用航空機攻擊砲台及爆炸水陸等設備（丁）使陸戰隊協同陸軍作戰諸點、宛然爲上海事變的一個寫實、</p>
<p>所以此次演習、不妨稱做兵力和設備　是高級化的上海事</p>
<p>九空中戰術</p>
<p>在此一計劃中最堪注目者、其攻擊軍竟爲世界無匹之高速度的空襲軍、以下即其現勢之槪要、</p>
<p>噸數砲力丨丨數飛機速力</p>
<p>巡洋戰隊七○·○○○八吋砲丨六五二八三三</p>
<p>航空戰艦六六·○○○八吋砲丨一六一三六三三</p>
<p>水雷戰隊一五·○○○十八吋魚雷一四四三五</p>
<p>艦隊速力達三十二節、再加上百八十餘的航空軍的勢力、戰時或迅速的襲擊敵國、這種獨有的海上戰的作戰法、不能不説是無可比擬的理想的編製、以二大航空母艦爲中心、兩端配以一萬噸巡洋艦七隻、前後護以十二隻驅逐艦、越惡濤、渡險浪、浩浩蕩蕩、奔駛於太平洋上、其壯烈有如斯者就實質而言、像這種實力雄厚的［高速艦隊］在其他任何國家尚屬無聞、所以美國海軍演習的戰術、是美國所獨有的、</p>
<p>高速陸軍ＳpeedyＡrmy和化學戰部隊共爲美國陸軍的二大特徵、現在海軍方面也在積極要使這二種特質實現、欲使艦隊的戰鬭力增高、則唯有改進艦隊在海上的速力、及謀攻擊方面的迅速、因此美海軍决定在攻擊方面利用飛機、所以海上戰略實亦含有空中戰略的意味、</p>
<p>布哇攻擊軍的組織目的、是爲某處領土或屬地被敵軍占領時、不待敵人將防衛佈置完畢、即舉行反攻、或於宣戰之後、在最短時間内攻下某處目標、</p>
<p>在這種戰略下、如果防衛準備尚未完畢的布哇敵軍、遭了反攻軍的爆炸及砲火、一場空中大戰之後、即告屈服、（二月五日）布哇再懸美國國旗時、敵軍艦隊即向太平洋方面開始進攻了、（二月六日）</p>
<p>十潛水艦</p>
<p>此次戰役、攻擊軍的三十六架爆炸機飛翔於奥發島空中襲擊時的壯觀和威力、比轟炸吳淞砲台的我國（日本）空軍不知又要强烈幾倍、布哇防軍正以幾十架戰鬭機飛空襲敵時、攻軍又起戰鬭七十六架逆擊、此時爆炸較輕之偵察機亦行加入、雙方飛機不下二百餘架、樹葉般的飛舞於空際、其壯觀當在想像以外、然而此時潛水艦在防禦上奏了如何的效果呢、布哇備有二十五隻潛水艦、此艦出擊的大目標就是蘇拉突加號及列新頓號二大母艦、防禦軍方面所以恃賴潛水艦者、因用以放射魚雷而擊敵軍之航空母艦也、如能將兩艦擊沉一隻、則敵軍之制空力即將减半、不僅可慰居民對空襲的恐佈、且於近世海戰援助主力砲戰的效果亦大、布哇潛水艦隊能否達到上項的期望、我們祗好待諸日後演習的戰報了、此外尚有一個極堪注目的就是攻擊軍裏没有潛水艦、並且美國海軍主力艦隊的編制裏也没有潛水艦、</p>
<p>試看此次布哇戰的攻軍、對航空母艦羣（ＣarrierGroup）非常重視、而對潛水艦則並無一隻、這便是在攻勢戰上不使用潛水艦的表示、换言之、即潛水艦祇用之於沿岸防禦而不用之於進行攻擊也、日本和美國（及英國）對潛水艦評價之不同、於此即可知之、</p>
<p>更須注目的、是攻擊軍不用潛水艦而於主力作戰上反爲便宜的理由、這種理由有二個意思、一爲魚雷可由空中放射、一爲由空中轟炸敵軍之潛水艦、美國海軍對於空軍的利用爲世界第一流者、而對在空中發見的敵軍潛水艦時轟擊的技術、亦不能降爲世界第二、美國攻軍不用潛水艦的原因就是因爲如果自己也有潛水艦時、則空軍偵察時對水中潛艦、敵我不分、致戰術上感最大困難故也、所以如在空中發現潛艦、必爲敵軍、而可安心投彈轟炸、</p>
<p>此即平時重視潛水艦的海軍國所最注目的一件事、同時、在此次演習裏攻軍之所以不用潛水艦的理由、由此也可以明白了、</p>
<p>十一攻到西海岸</p>
<p>演習的第二期、奪回了布哇的偵察部隊、由大巡洋艦及航空母艦組成的急速戰隊、於布哇戰後即掉反艦首向美國本土開始作侵略戰去、防禦美國本　的是太平洋艦隊、主力戰艦隊、由戰艦十四隻、經巡洋艦四隻、驅逐艦三十五隻、及航空戰隊若干隻所組成、在二月六日至二月十七日内爲應戰急速戰隊的奇襲、及擔任防禦本國沿岸的期間、從美國當局公佈的此次演習目的爲［對美國西海岸防禦能力的最大試騐］一點上看來、這第二期演習、占領根據地演習、在三次演習裏算最重要的了、用主力戰隊充當防禦軍、其目的不僅爲取守勢演習的表示、並且多少有些意思是爲試練并宣傳此次參加攻軍裏的大巡洋艦、並且航空兵力的試練和宣傳、亦爲其附帶的目的、</p>
<p>在這個演習裏第一開展的便是攻防兩軍的海上大戰、第二便是攻軍攻進三藩市、三狄哥、三皮多羅等三處之任何一處、在這裏再演海陸協同戰空中戰等、蘇拉突加及列新頓兩艦的轟炸機實行轟擊美國西海岸的軍用設備、砲臺、根據地、工塲等、守軍的戰鬭機則從事截擊、一方則海陸互相交砲、戰到此時、對於陸上設備的不完全、及水上艦隊的勢力不均、國民們自然可以上目了然了、</p>
<p>十二聯合訓練及化學戰</p>
<p>第三期演習、爲美國艦隊全體演習、（一）聯合戰術運動、（二）砲擊、（三）魚雷射擊之訓練、舉行期間、自三月五日起、約二十日内、三月三十一日舉行、（四）戰技試演、在此期内、［着色水柱］及［遠隔照明］等新式射擊亦行演試、着色水柱是各艦的主砲彈落在敵艦附近的水裏揚起來的水柱、因各艦的不同、而染各種顔色、例如、考羅拉號艦爲赤色、梅麗籃艦爲黃色等、各艦有各艦的分别顔色、以便飛機由空中測量落下彈及敵艦間之距離而報告於發砲本艦、以求目標準確、對三萬碼以外的敵人、發一砲二砲、是不會中彈的、先觀第一彈落於敵人前方幾十碼、第二彈再描準射去、看其落於敵後幾十碼、第三彈再描準向命中環射去、所以同時落下水去的各艦砲彈均能因各艦而分别測出距離、當然要歸功於［着色水柱］、</p>
<p>照明彈雖然没有什麽奇異之處、但由戰艦上巨砲射出、越十五哩炸裂於敵艦之上、可將直徑五百碼之週圍突然照亮、然後再擊之以砲、此種試演、當深有意味、美國海軍於化學戰方面的發展努力如斯、也深值驚異、</p>
<p>魚雷在日本海軍非常重視、而在美國則適得其反、聯合訓練裏戰技的中心就是航空戰隊爲主、如魚雷若從軍艦發射旣苦於方向差誤及速力差誤、難得準確、何况遠隔三萬碼外、其命中率及效果更必低减、所以有人主張今後由飛機投射、即於敵軍戰鬭機不能下降時、及敵艦發砲回數最少之距離内、魚雷即可由飛機投射之、比從軍艦射出來的效力當然大些、最終再寫二個重要的結論、（未完）</p>

<h3>馮占海代表談熱河陷落經過</h3>
<p>東北義勇軍第九軍、最近編爲陸軍第六十三軍之馮占海代表趙濯華、　冠軍兩君、自前日抵滬後、連日紛向各方報告熱河失陷之經過、國聞社記者昨晤之於旅邸、茲紀其所談熱河陷落之經過如下、</p>
<p>後方空虚</p>
<p>由承德至阜新及開魯、均爲一千二百里、開魯原由湯部崔新五旅駐守、朝陽由湯部董福亭旅駐守、介乎開朝之間者、則爲阜新、由敵軍（馮占海部）駐守、自僞聯軍向我進攻後、我後方遥遥一千二百里之途程、中間無防軍、無兵站、無給養、無餱糧、舉凡一槍一彈、均仰給於承德、一飲一食、均須自行四出尋覓、其不便爲何如乎、</p>
<p>湯弟激變</p>
<p>湯玉麟弟頗欲得董旅之某級軍官之位置、以致激動該旅圑之憤、遂爾倒戈附逆、朝陽一失、全局動摇、敝軍本可由阜新退建平、奈以附逆部隊、以引逆軍佔領建平、敝軍乃奉湯命、集中赤峯、遂由下窪子及大新塔拉向赤峯集中、時孫殿英軍亦由圍塲向赤峯增援、竟不幸復生誤會、殊堪扼腕、現敝軍在　　　、孫軍在　　、蘇炳文部由　　南　、已取得聯絡、成　角之勢、惟此一千二百里</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>之長途中、毫無後備援軍、致　日僞軍長驅直進、倍極痛心、</p>
<p>南來任務</p>
<p>此次南來、一方面固爲呼籲後援、一方面則爲解釋誤會、今北方當局將陷落熱河之責任、委諸義勇軍之身、試問一千二百里中無兵站、無援軍、無給養、是否對强隣作戰之所宜、是否轉戰年餘、跋涉千里、毫無給養之義軍所能專尸其咎、</p>
<p>監委彈劾</p>
<p>昨日報載監察委員劉莪青彈劾張湯之原文、中有［孫以孤軍受　旅取退部隊及義勇軍　占海　桂堂　逆之影響］等語、閲之殊深駭　、劉桂堂是否附逆、不得而知、敵軍却受飢寒、跋涉千里、轉戰年餘、爲國犠牲、固百死莫辭、乃不得政府之援助與矜恤、而翻加以附逆之名、歷史上留此污點、雖終有水落石出之時、然其悲憤爲如何乎、不將使愛國志士衛國健兒痛心欲死耶、現已致函京友、请向劉莪青委員處探詢其何所根據而云然矣云云、</p>

<p>中國工商管理協會、昨日中午十二時、在北京路聯華總會開聚餐討論會、同時歡宴新自國外考察實業　國之孔祥熙氏、孔氏爲該會理事長、故該會并請其演講此次考察實業之心得與感想、使本埠工商各界、藉以明瞭國外實業情形、俾資借鏡、到會者計潘序倫、潘仰堯、陳濟成、何德奎、張子廉、陳立廷、吳藴初、黎照寰、曹雪祥、徐永祚、李祖範、穆藉初、劉鴻生、趙晋卿、方液仙、及前實業部長孔祥熙等四十餘人、即席由孔氏演説此次出國考察實業之感想、及此後中國發展實業之意見、講畢、何德奎李公樸等復相繼發問、孔氏一一致答、至二時盡歡而散、茲分誌孔氏演詞及答問於後、</p>
<p>袪弊存利孔氏起立演説、首略述我國今日之國際關係地位、以分頭努力爲　、嗣講此次考察所見及感想、　余此次出國考察實業　當世界經濟恐慌、實業衰落之際、至美國時、有人謂余、君此行適不巧、恐不能見此　　業之盛况、余意正與此相反、蓋吾儕僅見先進國家經濟上全盛時代、則吾人將以正路繁盛國家之制度爲師、而不知其弊害、今　　趨於衰落時期、正足　吾人借鏡、俾今　　國建設、可存其利而袪其弊、如醫生之見病狀後始可處方療治然也</p>
<p>失業嚴重美國全人口爲一萬萬二千萬、而經常失業者達一千四百餘萬、如　失業者之妻子男女計算在内、最少有四千餘萬、達全國人口三分之一、其問題之嚴重可知、一年中銀行之倒閉者數千家、社會經濟恐慌、達於極點、余在紐約時、曾有人導觀某銀行導者　保管庫云、此中纍纍者均爲現幣、蓋　存欵銀行有倒閉之虞、均提出而　藏於保管庫、致社會金融　滯、日陷於恐慌、</p>
<p>享受過奢至歐洲德英等國失業恐慌情形、亦與此略同、推其原因、不外兩種、一爲平時消費過甚、未發生恐慌以前、工人之生活較安定、於享受方面、　事講究、復以大量生産關係、推銷方法、務求　利於顧客、先付十元、卽可得一　　、五元可購一　琴其餘悉由每週所得工資中、逐漸繳付、一且失業、固定之收入旣無、當然無力繳付、往昔孕用之品、悉行追回、卽日用所需之床椅等物、亦　捐以償　、終日　　街　、無家可歸者、在紐約一市、卽不下數十萬人、　　羣趨投機其第二原因、則爲投機、較大之公司、均在其股票出售於市塲、投資者頗多從事於此項買賣、利用其價格之漲落、以　利益、而股票之漲落、　　　於市場之供求、竟無人問及公司　　盛衰、且因生産過　、陷入停　、股票價格、乃大　特跌、竟有　五百元而售價不及五元者、破産斱妆踵相望、羣相牽引、社會經濟、乃益趨恐慌、至　法情形、與此稍有不同、因彼無大工業、而爲小工業之生産、故無上述恐慌之狀、意人嘗謂、吾儕不若美國　富、故亦未遭美國之危機也、</p>
<p>關税壁壘今日歐美各國、最成問題者爲戰債、歐洲各國在戰時欠　債甚多、而近年來各國均陷入經濟恐慌中、無鉅量金錢、可資償付、僅能以貨物抵償、而美國自己生産之貨物、尚不能暢銷、何需其他各國之貨爲抵、於是各國　關税　壘、日益高築、致國際貿易、日益减　縮、而金融之流通亦日狹、世界經濟恐慌、益日陷於危機、而美國方面、復不能放棄戰債、因募集時、取之於民、今人民已在窮乏恐慌之中、政府又何敢斷然豁除、以重增人民負担、</p>
<p>五項意見余　行世界考察之結果、頗多足資吾國今後發展實業之借鏡、爲吾人所應遵循者、簡言之、約有五端、一·政府及重要工商業圑體、對全國實業、應有相當之經濟統制、二·力謀生産量與消費量相適合、三·防止投機事業之過分澎漲、四·力谋勞資雙方之協調、五·提倡並復興農業、俾期我國已崩潰之經濟、得有復蘇之望、並爲工商業發展、樹永固之基礎、</p>
<p>法國情形孔氏演講畢、何德奎詢以法國經濟情形、孔氏答謂比較好、世人　以巴黎代表法國、實則大誤、因巴黎爲國際之遊藝場、其一切設施、均爲招徠他國人士之遊覽起見、而非法國之本色、法人之處綁　者、非常勤懇、而善儲蓄、故國内經濟、比較穏定、其次有人詢以英國對中日爭端之態度孔氏答謂、英人不願作第三者犠牲、竭力避免牽人漩渦也、</p>
<p>社會革命最後李公樸詢以美德英諸國經濟恐慌日甚、在蘇聯經濟建設之對照下、是否卽將爆發社會革命、孔氏答謂、英國經濟、已開始有向上之勢、德國須視希特勒上台後、能否移轉而定、惟恐太事高壓、足引起反響耳、至美國情形最複雜、頗難預斷、惟美人富有自信及負責心、或可努力渡此難關耳、</p>

<p>本市德僑傾向舊國旗</p>
<p>字林報云、德國仍用黑紅金三色旗爲國旗乎、抑改用舊日之黑白紅三色旗乎、此爲德國所將解决之問題、本埠德僑則坦然處之、據德國電傳、國社黨已將黑紅金三色共和旗卸下、而改懸黑白紅三色舊旗、中綴國社黨　字黨徽云、惟上海迄今尚未更改、昨以此事詢諸駐滬德總領事署、據答、黑紅金三色旗、乃共和德國憲法中所規定者、如新國會决議修改憲法中關於國旗之條文、或總統下特别命令、更改國旗則上海將立即更改云、至於本埠德僑對於改用舊旗之情感、昨據某有聲望者語字林報代表、謂本埠德僑對於黑白紅國旗改爲黑紅金三色向以爲憾、第旣爲安分之國民、不得不加遵從、又謂德人覺處於黑白紅三色旗下、頗有意味、因德國昔用此旗之日、爲世界大國、故皆尊重此旗、至德國將來能復爲大國與否雖不可必、然恢復舊日光榮時代之旗、固上海德人所歡迎者也云云、</p>

<h3>魯班路發生政治綁案</h3>
<p>韓革命黨李春山被綁</p>
<p>我軍警界極重視此事</p>
<p>前日下午五時四十五分、南市二區總署轄境魯班路星星里口發生之迷離撲朔綁架案、各情曾誌本報、惟肉票究屬何人、事後經該區調查結果、方知被綁者即係已入我國國籍之韓國革命獨立黨領袖李春山氏、（一名李裕弼）内容完全政治關係、實非普通綁架勒贖之綁票案可比、華界軍警當局異常重視、現已竭力偵查、俾本案得獲早日大白、茲將詳情探錄於後、</p>
<h3>黑牌汽車绝望塵而去</h3>
<p>前日下午五時四十五分、南市二區總署轄境魯班路星星里口、突然發現路人狂呼綁票聲、旋即有人奔告該管麗園路派出所、據稱頃間星星里口預停有黑牌汽車一輛、未幾、有一乘坐黃包車者經過、汽車内即躍出綁匪四五人、將黃包車上之乘客拽下、挾入汽車、該乘客即狂呼綁票、迨附近居民聞聲趕出、祗見汽車绝塵而去、故號碼末由細認云云、</p>
<h3>呢帽一頂外無線索</h3>
<p>本案發生後、該區區長金田、立用電話報告督察處、一面竭力偵查、惟除在肇事地點檢抬被綁者灰色呢帽一頂外、其餘毫無缐索可尋、但結果終至大白、蓋被綁者爲已入我國國籍之韓國獨立黨領袖李春山氏、李現年四十九歳、自幼生於朝鮮平山義郡地方、爲中韓革命同盟會之領袖、</p>
<h3>歸化中華移居滬南</h3>
<p>李於今年一月十九日、領到國民政府内政部、所發洪字十一號國籍許可證、實行改入我國國籍、　家　　法租界　　路寳康里五十四號、但自一二八戰事之後、李鑒於日本偵探曾往法租界非法手叚、私捕韓人、爲預策安全計、乃另　居於華界西門某處、</p>

<h3>赴友人約變起倉卒</h3>
<p>李因韓人、且爲革命袖領、故久爲帝國主義者所重視、每欲得而甘心、卒以李之行踪極秘、迄未得手、李亦自知處境危險、故平時深居簡出、除必要時隻身潛出外、與外界甚鮮往還、詎前日下午六時許、李應友人之約、冒雨乘黃包車、赴盧家灣南魯班路星星里一九○號弄二號韓人金志剛處、會談要事、初不料甫抵弄口、而禍變即來、</p>
<h3>矮小三匪呼救已杳</h3>

<h3>限期破案區長爲難</h3>
<p>同時華界市政當局、聞李氏被綁訊、異常注意、並認爲李氏被綁、决非普通綁架勒贖之綁案可比、内容定含有重大意味、當嚴飭該管二區區長金田、限日破案、旅滬全體韓僑僉以自一二八以後、法租界韓僑遷居華界二區境内者、爲數甚多、並迭次請求該管區署注意保護、今竟在白晝中、綁架革命領袖、韓僑大有人人自危之槪云、</p>

<h3>女子解放與家庭問題</h3>
<p>丨漢口楊腴文女士來信丨</p>
<p>我有一個難解决的問題，請你犠牲一點寳貴時光，給我一個具體的指示，不幸的我，早年喪母，已受盡人間的艱苦，所幸讀了幾年書，獲得了些微知識，不料頑固的父親在我高中只差　年畢業的時候，用强迫的手段，將我嫁給一個素不相識極腐敗的人家去，那時因我久在學校讀書一點也不明了舊家庭的情形，以爲有一千元的嫁　費，结婚後仍可繼續求學，那知婆家非但不允，還説了一些諷剌話，不到一年又生了一女孩，所以讀書一事，暫且作罷，專心撫養我的孩子，使她成爲有用之人，爲國効力，這是我對國家應盡的義務，可是環境不容許我這樣做，倘使牽就環境，則我的精神肉體太受痛苦，一定難盡我的天年，我來婆家，不到半年，已得了氣病，險遭不測！我死不打緊，但是我不願我的孩子再受無母的痛苦，唉，先生；你一定不明了在舊式人家做媳婦的可憐，我這支秃筆也難形容於萬一，總之我這位婆婆是極刁惡兇狠的，一張窮嘴終日放在我的身上人眞是眠食不安，甚或聽了小姑細叔以及奴婢們的刁唆，還要大駡特駡，動武欲打，使我無可奈何，不得已屈膝賠禮始罷休，不管她們怎的虐待，是不許哼一聲，或流一滴涙的，因爲婆婆説，倘使她家有一點不順時，就不得饒我們，先生！人非木石，怎能不憂悶而成病呢！每欲脱離這種黑暗家庭，可是我們夫妻間又無什麽惡感，特别捨不得我那一塊肉！將近半歳的小孩，只得忍氣吞聲，苟延殘喘，啊，天長地久，何日能脱離這人間地　！説句壞良心的話，婆婆年紀輕，等得頭髮白，也難伸頭，説到分居，那是萬做不到的，因她家素主張大家庭制度，不但不能成功，她還要説我離間她母子感情，并且家中經濟也分配不來，特别是我這位丈夫，年紀只十九歳（小我五歳多）又未進過學校，（中文是很好的）乳氣未脱，且很畏　伊母，那能救我離却苦海！弟兄又多，專　一點祖産，終非善策，我的性情，素來梗直，不甘過道非人生活的日子，想及女子所以受　迫的根本原因，無非因經濟不能獨立，我現在急切需要職業了，我又没有特長，到何處去找職業呢，我想一面去入補習學校，另外抽空去人某剌　學校學習縫織，但是我的乳兒交誰照管呢？如何能得彼頑固者的許可呢？假使我這最後一線希望失敗了，若是再受彼等欺凌，我一定要實行脱離或分居辦法，請先生告示我脱離或分居的手續，受不受娘家的干涉，在我這孤苦無信的弱女子，處在娘婆二家的惡勢力範圍之内，在法律上能否佔　勝，我心愛的孩子能否歸我撫養成人！這是最大問題丨熱心濟世的先生，祈你　導迷失了路的羔羊！</p>
<p>答；來書略復如下；（一）女士的家庭痛苦，是中國舊家庭之一般的現象，爲今之計，最好是毅然决然地，抛棄一切，到外邊來謀獨立生活，這種辦法最澈底，最痛快。觀女士的意向，恐怕做不到這一層，那不得就要（二）和你的丈夫商量好了，兩人想法出來謀生活，或先請你的丈夫出來謀生活，或是你先出來謀生活，我看你的文字很通順，字　也很整齊，苦能找得一個書記職務，便有辦法；因爲你們之所以備受家庭痛苦者，就是因爲經濟不能獨立，經濟獨立，問題已經解决一大半。不過你的丈夫旣是個［乳氣未脱］的十九歳的青年，又没有反抗舊家庭的勇氣，那想不出兩全的法子了。（三）還有一個法子就是：先慫恿你的丈人出來求學，使他到大都市來呼吸呼吸工業社會的文明，也許會把他的乳氣慢慢地消化了去。然而這裏也有一個危險，女士不能不慮到。就是他果然吸收了工業的文明空氣，鼓起了他的反抗舊家庭的勇氣，但是他的眼界也必然隨之增高，你旣然大他幾歳，不怕他［見異思遷］［舍其舊而新是謀］嗎？不過暫且可不必太遠慮了。假使他眞那時對不起你，你更可插開身子或是帶着小孩到外邊來自己過自己的，亦俯仰無愧丨在現在，假使一個女子决心要脱　萬惡的家庭，法律是不會有什麽强制服從的。</p>

<h3>濕派與酒桶</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>經過美國四十八州四分之三的同意權而懸爲厲禁的　律，自從一九二十年公布以後直至本年三月羅斯福就任日止，已滿足了十三週年而有餘。</p>
<p>美國人主張禁酒的是乾派，反對禁酒的是濕派共和黨中多乾派，民主黨中多濕派。去年十一月中旬羅氏當選爲大總統，濕派的民主黨抬頭了。本報載最近羅氏就任的光怪儀仗中，有一個酒家拖着酒桶而行，這是濕派的大示威。有了弛放酒禁的羅斯福爲一國元首，一般外國式的，劉伶李太白，合該對於游行的酒桶，大拍其手而狂喊其口號了。</p>
<p>吾以爲酒桶前面，最好有頌揚三酉兒的文章寫上旗幟，那麽，益發可以替濕派張目了。吾國的白香山，是濕派中的巨子，他有一首讚酒的詩，比着劉伶的酒德頌還好；我把來寫在後面，倘有人譯作外國詩，贈與新大陸的濕派同志，倒是一份極好的禮物呢。</p>
<p>湛湛尊中酒，有功不自伐；不伐人不知，吾今代其説：良將臨大敵，前驅千萬卒；一　投河飲，赴死心如一。壯士磨七首，勇憤氣咆勃；一酣忘報　，四體如無骨。東海殺孝婦，天早踰年月，一酌　其　，通宵雨不歇。咸陽秦獄氣，寃痛結爲物；千載不肯散，一沃亦銷失。况茲兒女恨，及彼幽憂疾；快飲無不消，如霜得春日，方知　　靈，萬物無與匹。</p>
<p>酒的　力，酒的權威，無論舊大陸，新大陸，都是不可以一世。</p>
<h3>要人與名人</h3>
<p>— 鵑雲</p>
<p>丨我的幻想丨</p>
<p>忙碌了新聞記者兩條腿，［奔波與訪問，］使我們能常在報紙上讀到深切的偉論，高明的見地。自然在要人與名人的一舉一動，都可以採作新聞的資料，要人與名人，是社會的棟樑柱石。</p>
<p>但是要人與名人却分着兩種性質，在國家有主持國政的要人，市府有主市政的要人，商業上也有商界的要人，也許我以爲拉街車的老王也是要人，因爲他家裏一家七口子都靠他拉車度日。</p>
<p>祗是他在自己家裏算是要人，在人家看來未必是要人，在中國算是要人的，在外國人看來也不一定算他是要人；再或者在以前他算是要人，失勢或死亡以後，已不能再認爲他是要人了。</p>
<p>所以［要人］的名稱，祗適用於當權的時期之内。</p>
<p>名人似乎便不同了，無論過去現在將來我們始終欽仰有加，尊稱一聲ＸＸ名人。</p>
<p>名人是很多很多的，做小説的稱爲小説名家，做詩的稱爲著名大詩家，無論研究哲學，科學，以及政治，法律，經濟，醫術，到處都可以瞻仰得到，大而全世界，小而一縣一鎭都有幾位有聲譽的名人。我生平便有奇性的夢想，夢想我也會成功一個名人。</p>
<p>在上月内看到蕭伯訥在北平游天壇的專電，我很能想起我自己曾經游過三次天壇。實在使我欽崇拜倒，因爲蕭伯訥是一個名人，尤其是一個世界的名人。　　在上海很有不少名人，已做了許多偉大驚人的事蹟，聽見旁人時常講的，報紙上所揭載的，無論是各銀行的董事，公司的發起人，救國籌賑，市政商場，似乎在上海那們許多人之中，熱心的僅僅是幾個上海名人！我常想到倘若我也會僥倖或一個上海名人，自然是談何容易，夢想不能成事實，我還天生了一副可憐的骨頭！至少我也應付不了這些多才多藝而偉大的各種事業，但是我始終這們幻想，也許我會成一個名人。</p>
<p>猪</p>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>丨自己没用丨</p>
<p>上海有一般乞丐，專跟在人的後面，亦步亦趨的揑着一個紙製的漏斗討錢。這一種乞術，名爲趕猪　，他們是把施主當作猪看的。上海有一種盜匪，專躲在冷僻黑暗的所在，專候單身漢子踽踽凉凉的走過，盜匪們　喝一聲，手槍一舉，一個箭步，便動身來剥單身漢子的衣服。這一種刦術，名爲殺猪　，他們也是把被刦者當作猪看的。把錢佈施給乞丐，把衣讓給了盜匪，結果却捐得了一個猪頭銜，在這人心不古的時代，好人眞做不得。</p>
<p>有人説，中國是睡猪。阿呀呀！不敢不敢。横一個協定，　一個條件，這塊啃一些，那邊挖一塊。咱中國是量大福大，做些好事，滿不在乎，你愛檢甚麽，就檢甚麽，要求啦，甚麽啦，怪可鄰兒的。呀，不好了，這樣婆婆媽媽的，他倒趕起猪　來了。這可不行，好人做不得。呀，更不對了，不佈施了，乞丐　爲盜匪，一聲　喝，手槍對着腦袋，不依，就扳，依了，便把衣服剥去，實行殺猪　。可憐得很，中國老是處於被趕被殺的地位，這是從何説起。</p>
<p>被乞丐趕得　煩了，本可喊巡捕來捕捉的。但是巡捕來了，乞丐走開了，你又奈何他不得。被盜匪剥了衣服去，本可報捕捉拿的，但是，待到巡捕來時，盜匪已去得遠了。這種巡捕肯跟着你走去捉丐捕盜，放馬後砲的，據説還算好的咧。有些不負責的巡捕，你儘滿頭大汗的去告訴他，他却似理不理地冷笑着道，猪　，你爲甚麽不把乞丐或强盜捉住？現在已經跑掉了，性急甚麽？</p>
<p>嗚呼，猪，自己没用，有甚麽好説！</p>

<p>日前太倉城内，大閙龍燈，情景之盛，空前未有，我住在最熱閙的中心地叚，坐在樓窗口，憑欄遠看，大飽眼福　　在黃昏過後，全城的人。熱洪洪地集聚在大街兩旁，等待這爭奇鬥勝的龍燈的到臨，不久，有一二聲爆竹聲突破那遠處空間的岑寂，接着大衆歡聲雷動，説：［龍燈到了，龍燈到了，］果然，音樂隊喧　地敲着中國古代的鑼鼓，欵欵走來，霎時間燈火齊明，那接續着的維妙維肖的幾條龍燈，已現在我們的目前，忽然，有一聲聲振屋瓦的爆竹聲，振動我們的耳鼓，那龍燈舞起來了，蜿蜒天矯地舞起來了，龍的身内，燃着五光十色的燈，那兩隻龍眼，是用乾電裝成，光缐閃爍，耀人兩目，遠遠地看去，那幾條龍燈的舞態，誰不説是和眞龍一樣？但仔細看來，那龍燈的腹部，用十幾根短竹棒支撑着，有十幾個人，各執一棒，舞弄這幾可亂眞的龍燈，呵！龍燈龍燈！我當你是自在地舞着，那知你被人執着走動呢？</p>
<p>在東北稱執政的溥河哥，據説他還欲稱孤道寡，在他自己看來，未嘗不是乘時［龍興］；即在一班［從龍］之輩，也未嘗不當他是［龍章鳳姿］的眞命天子，可是在他人目中，這位溥執政，和被人舞弄的龍燈，有什麽分别？你看丨那許多的矮人，正牽着他走動呢？</p>
<p>溥儀呵丨我當你是什麽？原來是一條被人舞弄的龍燈。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張根水</p>
<p>第一回推食殷勤　貧女憶人門慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>趙自强道：老太太，您放心，我雖是個當兵的人，可是不佔人家便宜。常言道：好鐵不打釘，好人不當兵。我就不服這句話，當兵的人，替國家出力，才拿着幾個錢啦？吃的是雜麵窩頭，穿的是破爛片，可都是幹着賣命的玩意。弟兄们自然也有不好的，這可不是人一當兵就不好，也不是好人就不幹當兵的這一件事，只因爲招兵的人，壓根兒就没有招好人來當兵。再説當兵實在也苦，大槪人只要對付着能過去，就不當兵了。您望後瞧，我這個當兵的人，只和别個當兵的有些不同，説着話，他一直向裏院裏走來。江氏也覺得這個人説話，非常之痛快，跟在後面陪話，一路走來裏院來。裏院是三間北屋兩間東西廂房，一個上人，帶着一個下人，在這裏正是是好過，趙自强裏裏外外，在各屋子裏看了一遍，便向江氏道：我知道，您府上人口簡單，就是我們家裏，也没有什麽人。我們老太爺爲人很古道的，請您放心。江氏道：我們有什麽不放心啦，和您這樣的人在一塊兒住家還有什麽不好的嗎？趙自强笑道：老實説，人家總是那樣想着好人不當兵，所以和什麽人混在一處，人家也是不高興。就是説出來賃房子吧，房東首先就怕你不給房錢。江氏笑道：您這是笑話。趙自强正色道：我這是眞話。就是賃這所房子：我還託了好幾個人去和房東説，準没有錯，又先付了三個月的房錢，這才賃下來了。總而言之一句話，我們當兵的人，總是讓人家看不起。説畢歎了一口氣，又道：我總望我們當兵的人，要爭回這一口氣。説着話，又走了出來。江氏覺得這個人説話，十分爽快，心裏也就有幾分歎喜，便疾道：連長，到我們家坐坐，先喝一杯茶去好嗎？趙自强站着想了一想，笑道：好丨我也應當到府上去奉看。於是江氏在前引路，拉開了風門，讓他進去。（八）</p>

<h3>霓虹燈下散步</h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>霓虹燈到處閃出横書的中國字，直書的羅馬字ＣＡＦＥ還有１２３４的亞剌伯數字。巴黎大戲院五時半的一塲散了，出　蓄音機的商店裏，用擴音機放播［　女之心的旋律］，彌陀夜光標準　的短針，指在ＶＩＩ字上面。耳邊廂　　聽見：［大晚夜報····老申報號外］眼前是化妝品店的窗飾：白粉，香水，口紅，和ＫＯＴＥＸ陳列在一起。</p>

<p>歐洲教育調查圑考察之經過（一）</p>
<h3>在歐調查工作</h3>
<p>問、在歐调查工作若何答、國聯中國教育考察圑之來中國調查、係由國際聯盟之國際文化協會主持、中國歐洲教育考查圑、雖由中國政府派遣、其在歐工作、則多與國際文化協進會合作、以中國係該會份子之一、該會職資、亦在促進國際文化之溝通、及交换與互助也、教育考查圑以八月五日由上海放洋、直赴意大利、八月底到日内瓦、與該會職員、及國聯衛生署長素與中國表同情之拉西曼博士會見、彼等在本圑未到歐洲之時、將考查國度、考查日程、及應與各國協作事項、已早爲佈置、並得各國之協助、該項原定計劃、規定考查期間四個月、前三月在波蘭·德國·法國、後一月則在英國、（但英國在彼時尚未十分確定、）該會代定之計劃、確甚週到、惟本圑同人以歐洲諸國教育、各有其特長之處、如不能盡觀重要國家之教育、殊無以副政府派遣之初心、因與該會商量增加意大利·丹麥·奥國·及蘇俄、並由該會商取各該國之同意、同時由本國呈請教育部延長考查期間二月、共爲六個月、後來幸均成功、計劃旣定、本圑遂於九月一日、由日内瓦赴波蘭、於九月三日到達、當日由華司克博士、饒博司客督學主任、曲亨博士等代表波蘭教育部、以預先擬定之參觀計劃與本圑討論、經細商之後、大體認爲妥善、遂於九月六日開始考查、除參觀瓦蕯市、波蘭首都費時數日外、其餘二十日曾參觀百打哥息市、格得里亞市·克拉哥市·喀托維茲市·查歌班市、及鄉村若干處、從大體言、波蘭西部·南部·西北部之教育、皆已略得其　槪、遂於十月一日轉至柏林、與伯克爾·黑克爾·李德滿·及德國外交部普魯士教育部代表等商定在德國考查之日程、十月五日至十日爲德國學校休業期、本　乃利用此閒暇時期、由德國去丹麥考查、當日到哥彭哈京、次日卽與丹麥教育部商定日程、該部派　森開博士、偕同每日赴各處參觀、共一星期、計城市及鄉村教育皆已略得　　、因卽按照　定日程、於十月十一日回德國之　比克市、德人黑克爾博士來迎、卽任翻譯、本圑遂由盧比克、而漢堡、而魯色道夫、而孔恒、而愛森、而司徒格得、而弗蘭克市、而明興、而拙士敦、凡歷十數城市旣鄉村無數、然後回柏林、良以德國教育之成績、夙聞名於世界、且德國並無統一之學制、各邦各自爲政、而各有其特長之處、不得不多費時日與精力也、德國完畢之次日、卽急去法國、當與郎之萬教授、教育部代表巴禮野博士、巴黎大學理學院院長及其他教育界名人等相見、商定在法考查日程、考查時期一月、分在巴黎·郎西·里昂·瑞城·等四大學區及其鄉區參觀、每處由二三日以至十餘日不等、在法完結之後、本圑卽去英國、倫敦有英國國際文化協進會職員波耳博士、教育部代表伍德博士等照料一切、其初數日、多與教育部及教育界名人、開會討論英國教育之制度及思想問題、然後赴牛津大學·劍橋大學·瑞定大學·里子市等處、每處考查數日、然後回倫敦、考查倫敦市之教育、直至十二月底、方始結束、本圑又不得不離英而去意大利矣、蓋在意之考查日程、自一月五日起也、一月五日、同人至意之吉内瓦、有意政府代表龐必安里教授來迎、卽於翌日在該處考查、祇一日而赴米蘭考查三日而至羅馬、由羅馬而拿波里、而旁白、復回羅馬而赴弗落蘭絲、而布郎格勒、而威尼斯、意大利之考查、卽此告終、一月二十一日、到奥國首都維也納、習日在教育部市教育局等處、討論奥國之教育、以後凡一星期有餘、均從事參觀各學校各教育機關、城市鄉村、雙方兼顧、二月三日、離奥入俄、五日到莫斯科、有我國中蘇會議代表處職員、蘇俄政府代表等前來照料一切、當日下午、卽商定參觀程序、次日卽行開始、凡十日而畢、本圑歐洲考查工作、至此完結、此各處考查行程之大槪、至於考查内容、則甚廣大、由幼稚園以至大學、由中央之教育行政、至地方最小單位之教育行政、由教室教學、以至電影教育、電音教育、無不一一留止、因此考查日程特别忙、每自早八九時開始參觀、必至午後六七時始得完畢、夜間則爲唯一整理筆記之時、然各國政府、往往利用此時、邀赴國家戲院觀劇星期日多往鄉間參觀教師休養所、地方教育會議、學生野外旅行、及其他與教育有關之活動、故在此數月之中、本圑同人、無一不感覺時間之不足、外國朋友、則均以本圑工作時間過多爲慮、但同人自審以能力薄弱之人、負此考查重責、不得不勤以補拙也（未完）</p>
<h3>在歐備受優待</h3>
<p>問、各國之招待情形若何、答、本圑在未啟行之先、已由國際聯盟國際文化協進會　有關係各國政府接洽、故各國先皆有準備、因之招待極爲周到、每到一國、卽有政府代表親到車站來接、例如教育部次長、外交司長等親來車站迎接、到意大利時、意政府特派教育部次長來米蘭迎接、到德國時、除政府代表外、前教育部長伯克爾博士亦親自來站、到法國亦大體相同、各國皆以政府名義邀　、每到一市、其市長·市教育局長·或親身來接、或派人招待、無不竭盡地主之誼、請餐、看戲或特開音樂會、　成各處慣例、每到一學校、校長教員均異常歡欣、留飯請題名、送學生成績、攝影紀念、亦幾於處處皆然、各國政府及各學校各教育機關、對於有關教育之材料、多盡量供給、便利同人之參考尤大、良以甲國政府正式派遣之教育考查圑、此爲第一次、和國政府及學校、深願爲代表東方有高深文化歷史之中國教育界合作、便能溝通中西文化、以促進人類之進步、同人等在各國政府及教育界此種高尚心理之下、遂處處受其優待也、</p>
<h3>材料處置辦法</h3>
<p>問、所得參考材料性質若何、將如何處置、答、此次所得材料至多、大部份由各國政府各教育機關所贈送、小部份由本圑選購、均先後於考查一國終了之後、裝木箱寄回、每國至少一大箱、有多至三四木箱者、材料性質、（一）教育法令、（二）教育書報、（三）學生成績品、（四）與教育有關之其他物品、此種材料、大可供教育界之參考、同人等在歐時、曾談及關於此項材料之處置、擬求整理之後、開一展覽會、或陳設於教育部圖書館中、俾教育界人士便於參考、將來究應如何辦理、自須候教育部决定、</p>
<h3>歐洲教育優點</h3>
<p>問、對於歐洲教育之感想若何、答、本圑將來定有攷查報告發表、歐洲教育之情形、及其可供中國教育之建設者何在、在報告書中、必將加以詳細之陳述、此時剛係攷查完結、尚未能加以整理、一未經圑體之决議、故難有正式意見發表、惟攷查數月、個人觀感甚多、固不妨以個人之見地、擇其重要者奉告、</p>
<h3>教育愈趨重視</h3>
<p>（第一）歐洲各國認識教育之重要、比之從前更爲親切、一致以教育爲改進個人·社會、國家、最根本·最有效之工具、故個人·社會、國家、亦一致努力以從事教育、各國個人及國家財政上之困難、比大戰前加甚、然而各級學校之學生數目、都比前加多、各級政府所担任之教育經費數目、亦比前加多、學校之建築、設備、比前良好、此均足爲各國認識教育、努力教育之明證、</p>
<h3>努力全民教育</h3>
<p>（第二）全民教育之重視、在昔吾人嘗聞人言歐洲教育係階級教育、貧賤階級不能享受、其因（一）爲學費昂貴、（二）爲複軌之學制、其實歐洲各國、目今注意全民之教育、義務教育不但無學費之可言、且多有供給學校用品者、許多國家對於幼兒不但給以良好之幼稚園、並給以餐食衣物、毫不取費、幼稚園之教育、在歐洲則爲貧窮人家之救濟事業、至於小學以上之教育、其屬於職業工藝者、收費至廉、貧窮子弟、容易入學、其他限製、亦不嚴厲、其屬於普通中學者、學費較貴、選擇甚嚴、但政府設有免費學額、凡貧寒子弟之聰明而勤奮者、初不慮不得入校肄業也、社會上更有若干通俗教育機關、足以增進一般人之知識與技能、有志求學者、大可利用、故實際上人人均有求學之機會、至於歐洲各國之學制、誠爲複軌、然各校間之互相轉换、其困難不如往昔所傳之甚、故歐洲教育、亦全民之教育也、</p>
<h3>學風極端良好</h3>
<p>第三、學風良好、歐洲各國任何國家、自中學以至大學、不聞學生有閙風潮者、不聞學生有提出意見强求學校採納者、亦不聞學生有違抗學校命令者、更絶無自選校長、驅逐教育之事、卽在蘇聯、亦絶無此種事實發生、蘇聯中等學校之學生自治會、學校教師且有强硬之指導、學生非遵從不可、蓋歐洲人一般見解、以爲自治與服從、確爲構成健全之國家與社會要素、學生在校、必須受此種訓練、然後方能爲良好之公民、至於學校教育之監察、責在政府、政府之監察、責在議會及公民、固不容青年學生自荒本業、越俎代庖、因各校學風良好之故、學生能安心學業、成績良好、教育事業不但足云已上正軌、實足云未嘗出軌、</p>
<h3>嚴格甄别教師</h3>
<p>第四、教師優良、歐洲各國中小學校教師、多半訓練時間較中國爲長、而且極爲認眞、加以嚴格之考試、然後始能入學畢業、畢業之後、必須經過相當時期之實習試用、方得爲正式教員、故其教師實較中國爲優、一經正式任命之後、卽爲永久服務、任何校長教育長官、非因特殊重大之過失、不能輕易免其職、教師之薪水、無論爲中學小學、教足敷一家之用、因無家室之憂、故能安心盡職、吾人於中小學中常見皓首窮年在一校服務三十年之教師者、職此故也、</p>
<h3>注重實用教育</h3>
<p>第五、注重實用科學及體育、在昔吾人亦嘗聞歐洲教育太偏於文化、中學校之拉丁文·希臘文分量過多、應用科學太少、此種見解、亦係僅知其一、歐洲小學爲生活基本之教育、自以生活必須之智識、技能爲主、中學以上有兩類學校、一類爲普通中學、以預升大學爲主、一類爲農·工·商·家·政等職業學校、此類完全注重應用科、普通中學之課程、有仍然保留拉丁希臘者、有已經放棄者、卽英國注重拉丁希臘公立中學、如今亦注重手工、（木工金工）及科學、其在俄國、注重科學手工之趨勢、比任何國家爲甚、拉丁希臘文已不見於課程表中、任何學生不得不入金工塲木工塲、幾於不能工作者不得爲學生也、因爲蘇俄努力於十年之内完成其工業化之國家、又其所需要之公民爲能工作之公民、故其教育不得不特别注重　用科學與手工、其餘各國之手工成績、至可　佩、高級小學及中學、無不有金工木工工塲、其工塲之設備與普通訓練正式工人相差無幾、故學生成績至爲良好、能自行製造學校應用之器具及科學教學上應用之儀器標本、據各學校當局解釋、目今國家經濟困難、學校經費不充、不能如往常之購用各種器具、及理物化學用之儀器、不得已訓　學生自行製造、其所費不過占購買者十之二三也、</p>
<h3>提倡軍事訓練</h3>
<p>又各學校之注重體育、比之大戰前加劇、其操法亦與我國所行之柔軟大有不同、卽籃球·足球·棒球·費用稍多之運動、已不常爲各　所採用、其推行最廣者如吾國鄉村兒童之種種游戲、及蹤·跪·爬·行之法、游泳十分注重、野外長途旅行、在德國及波蘭、亦努力提倡、原此種體育方法、更切實用省費而效鉅也、科學·手工·體育·三者之偏重、不但於教育上有深厚之意義、卽在社會生活與國防上亦有重大關係、因此後社會生活有不能工作卽不能生活之勢、應用科學較之其他學術與一般生活之關係爲密切、故教育上不得不重視之、又現今世界之暗潮、比之大戰以前、有過之無不及、各國不但在軍備上注意、尤其在戰士之準備、現今流行之體育、實爲最有效之軍事訓練、手工亦係軍士必備之技能、以兵士不但須能應用軍械、亦須能建築工　、及作最簡單之修理軍器也、學校教育、社會生活國家防敵、三者必須　　爲一氣、實爲中國切不容緩之圖、甚　政府及同胞再三之注意之、</p>
<h3>即將會草報告</h3>
<p>以上所谈、僅舉其最重要者簡單言之、本圑同人、一齊回國之後、卽將從事起草報告、謂國人指正、同人等能力薄弱、教育範圍太廣、時間太短、致所得結果、不但不能滿足政府及國人之希望、亦不能滿足同人自己之志願、但本所到國之政府及教育界已有相當之關係及深厚之感情、此後如能繼續不斷之聯絡、則彼此得益、當然不少、尤望此後常有專家陸續分往各國作更仔細更專門之考查、敝圑同人當盡其力之所及、爲盡聯絡介紹之責、則收效自更宏大也、（完）</p>

<h3>［飛歌］收音機營業之猛進</h3>
<p>飛歌無綫電收音機公司，創設不久，而營業盛况，竟少有能與比擬者，當一九二八年時，美國無綫電收音機事業，已甚發達，各處製造廠林立，月多已享有盛名，［飛歌］無綫電公司，適於此同業競爭最激烈之年創設，是年美國全國共製造無綫電收音機四百萬具，值價七萬萬金元，而［飛歌］無綫電收音機竟銷售至十萬具，約值七百五十萬金元，實佔全國營業之百分之二又半。</p>
<p>一九二九年，［飛歌］無綫電公司首先發明自動音度節制器，並用銷售方法改良，故得在全國銷售總數五百萬具中，售出五十萬隻，約佔全國營業之百份之十。</p>
<p>一九三○年，即飛歌無綫電公司創辦後之第三年，全國産量爲四百萬隻，每只一百二十五元，共計五萬萬金元，飛歌竟銷八十萬只，則幾佔全國無綫電收音機事業五份之一矣。</p>
<p>一九三一年，美國商塲萎頓，有許多工廠停工收歇，而［飛歌］廠出量反增至一百萬具，值八千六百萬金元，佔全美該業之三分之一，在下半年中竟佔該業百分之四十，去年該公司營業更盛，擴充資本，添置機器，聞每日已能出無綫電收音機一萬二千五百具，今則更從事於電視術之改良（即收影機）及其他關於收音機上之發明，使臻至善云。</p>
<p>該公司在中國設有分公司，寫字間及樣子間均在上海南京路九十六號，電話一七九三○號，歡迎各界參觀試聽。（該公司並經理飛歌牌蓄電池等）</p>
<h3>最新式史德華一○六型收音機之特點</h3>
<p>— 振之</p>
<p>史德華一○六型收音機具有六種特點：</p>
<p>（一）電台間噪音之鎭壓。</p>
<p>（二）［Ｑ］迥路。</p>
<p>（三）延緩自動音量操縱作用。</p>
<p>（四）用最新五九式出力眞空管以减少嗡嗡聲，並增加出力至ＰＺ五極眞空管之十分之二倍。</p>
<p>（五）增廣諧調區域，使能接收五四○基羅之最新週率。</p>
<p>（六）附有最新强力電源變壓器，可防止任何燒毁之可能性。</p>
<p>以上（一）（二）（三）三特點，對於任何收音機的收音上都有重要關係，所以這種特點勢必成爲此後無線電工業之標準。凡是愛好無線電的人，都有明瞭這種特點的作用之必要，這不但使你以善於駕御這種新式的收音機，而得到滿意的結果，並且還可以使你得到選擇良佳的收音機的基礎知識。茲將此種特點　　於下。</p>
<p>電台間噪音鎮壓</p>
<p>自動音量操縱的缺點之一，是當配諧於兩電台間時，時常有噪音襲來。這種缺點在一○六型機中，因有電台間噪音鎭壓和Ｑ回路而得矯正。</p>
<p>電台間噪音鎭壓的根本原理是限止兩電台間的人爲的，或天電的噪音。在這里請注意這［兩電台間］的意義。現在没有一種無缐電回路能夠隔絶已被天線接得之噪音和音號。所以當你説起兩電台間噪音鎭壓的時候，請不要忘記這種事實。</p>
<p>電台間噪音鎭壓的作用可以解釋如下。設空中有許多廣播電台，其所發的信號的音響，對於某一定區域，有各種不同的强度。若畫許多縱缐以其高度分别表出各個進入信號的强度，即成圖一所示的形狀。圖中ＡＢＣＤＥＦ爲六個</p>
<p>電台，各電台的信號强度，各不相同，當收音者轉動指度盤時，此等信號即都被陸續谐入　　又設在此特别時間，空中的天電噪音能以Ｃ台高度之直線表示之·意即此時進入的天電噪音，其響度恰和台所發出的音號相同。因爲天電噪音旣然在諧調指度盤上的各點一律存在，則我們自然可用高度爲Ｃ之Ｈ水平線來表示他。從ＡＢＤＦ各電台傳來的節目，往往混雜着等於Ｈ的天電噪音。然以此種噪音比之ＡＢＤＦ各電台總音量，爲量極微，故可被其掩没。但聽ＡＢ兩電台之音，却能收到極多之噪音。此外還有一個極難解决的問題就是，當收音機配諧於ＣＥ兩電台間時，其自動音量操縱即自動地昇高該機的選擇性至最高度，於是天電噪音即被全部帶入，至達到Ｂ電台爲止。這種噪音當諧調時極不悦耳。</p>
<p>我們若在這座收音機中，賦以一可變的選擇性操縱，我們就可減低其最大選擇性至某定值，設以水平綫Ｋ表之，如是則此機就不再能收受弱電台ＣＥ，或天電Ｈ之音。因此在配諧於ＡＢ間，ＢＤ間或ＤＦ間，收得的雜音一定極少，甚至於完全没有。所以這種選擇性操縱，可認爲一種電台間的噪音鎭壓。然而我們必須記信了，爲了要减弱選擇性，全體電台的音量也要相當地减少。但這音量的减少可以由增進音量操縱而得到調劑。</p>
<p>因爲天電噪音的水平綫，會隨區域和收受情形而不同，所以這種電台間的噪音鎭壓被造成一可變操縱，使其選擇性亦减弱到在那時候不再收到天電噪音爲止。不過我們還得記住，收音機之選擇性减弱後，就不能谐入較弱電台的音，並且能收得的電台的音，必伴着同樣比例的天電噪音，和不减弱一樣，即使將全音量减少，也是無效的。（未完）</p>

<h3>無線電界之好消息</h3>
<p>本埠仁記路二十五號，亞達公司，因滬上各界之置有無線電收音機者，日益衆多，而每遇機件損壞時，苦無完備之修理處所，以得滿意之修理，該公司有鑒於此，特設修理部，聘請前開洛公司，惠勒公司，無線電工程師，徐志方君主持，專代各界修理各種無線電收音機，以及一切附件，聞該公司所修機件，工作迅速，取價低廉，而修理之後，出立保單，務使各界異常滿意云。</p>
<h3>一年來馬爾柯尼無線電公司的成就</h3>
<p>— 丹</p>
<p>一九三二年，爲馬爾柯尼公司最進步最活躍的一年，我們只要一檢該公司重要部分之狀况，就可以知道一年來對於無綫電的研究，及無綫電在陸海空各界應用之增加與發展，是怎樣的重要。　　一、無線電研究方面與其一般的發展狀况</p>
<p>整個的無線電界之中，在一九三二年最爲出色，而在將來又充滿着實現的可能性者，即爲馬爾柯尼所宣示的，應用波長比一米突還短的［微波］，在理論上認爲可以達到很遠的距離。</p>
<p>馬爾柯尼和他的助手，已犠牲了不少的時間，研究此等極短波之應用。他們在羅哥地拍丨羅馬的附近丨與發加利　，沙定尼亞之間，作過距離一六八公哩以上的試騐傳遞。結果，明瞭此等極短的音波，竟能免除，由地球面的屈曲而生的種種阻碍。</p>
<p>其次引起全世界專門家及一般人注目之事，爲馬爾柯尼工程師兩年來對於無線電視之研究。去年八月查姆斯福的馬爾柯尼公司曾英國與約克的聖彼得學院，用無線電傳播電視新聞，將新聞消息印刷於一活動卷帶之上，以資播送，其速度爲一分鐘一二○字，接收者就可在一收報機的玻璃板上，很容易的閲讀。</p>
<p>就上所述，可知馬爾柯尼公司，已完成其特别可靠的無線電視工作。聽説他們將來對於這問題的研究，還要使其發展至能應用於商業上及娱樂上。即應用於廣播無綫電，家庭，露天舞台，及戲院之中。</p>
<p>就一般而論，無線電學近年來有很大的進步。即如電台的數量與電力旣都有增加而在發音方面，管理電波方法已日臻周密，收音方面，收音機的選音方法亦大有進步。因此乃復有對於計算器的要求，如爲改良實用所需要的電磁力强度計算器以及正確而又便於携帶的指示音號强度器，馬爾柯尼公司亦均已研究成就。應用於各種電磁計算上，很着成効：並且還創造了很多的機件於將來發電台的發展極有用處。</p>
<p>新式短波反射天綫，在桑默頓電台試騐，已經得到了很好的結果。這種新式天綫，易於舉辦，其所佔地位比現在巴爾柯尼電台所用的普通天綫爲小，而可得同樣的電波的集注。</p>
<p>在收音方面，感動鋭敏的商業收音機，已很發達，且已爲巴達克郵局所採用，此種用於接收反射電波的短波高等無綫電話收音機，都曾加以改良，最要的一點，則爲防止回音的發明。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>所望於播音臺者</h3>
<p>— 振之</p>
<p>我覺得無線電話播音臺至少負有兩種使命，一是傳遞消息，一是促進文化。對於前者，除了消息要靈通正確以外，並無何種改進可言，惟對於後者，其改進之點頗多，茲就管見所及，略舉一二，以供采擇。</p>
<p>第一，中國推行國語教育，已有十餘年之歷史，然而至今未見有若何之成績。其原因無非是爲了少聽少説之故。國语注音符號的作用，只能使人發準確的音，而不能使人説純熟的，所以每一個小學教師雖能懂得每個字的發音，而結果仍不能説一口純熟的國語。教師所説的旣不是純熟語，那末學生所學到的當然就可想而知了，照這樣地下去，要普及國語於全國，不知在何年何月？我覺得無線電話是推行國語教育的利器，每一個播音臺該負起這個普及國語的責任來。除了學術講演等節目外，其餘如時事報告，廣告，及各個節目的介紹詞等，統統須用國語播音，若能特别多設國語節目，那就更好了。</p>
<p>第二，爲了促進平民的教育計，我希望各大播音臺儘量减少低級趣味之節目，而增加各種通俗講演節目並且每日的講題，送交各報，彚集披露，使聽衆可以自由地選擇他所關心而感得興趣的題目。</p>
<p>第三，日本歐美各國，近來流行一種無線電文藝，就是把各種有意義的小説，故事，科學等，容納在有趣味的對話中，彷彿中國的［隔壁戲］。這種辦法，我們很可彷行，或托人翻譯，或倩人創作。我想，只要各播音臺表示有一種需要，這稿子一定會源源而來的。不過此種播音人材，須要特别造練，若是仍舊呌游藝圑裏的人來播音，結果一定會像白話劇之變成文明戲一樣。</p>
<h3>中國需要無線電（續）</h3>
<p>— 幼雄</p>
<p>無線電分通報與廣播二種。通報專以符號報告消息于遠處在我國有綫電報設備未遍这處，可利用之以補不足，固無得言。至廣播無線電之効果，最主要者約有三端。一曰教育，二曰娱樂，三曰報告。此三者實皆人生所不可缺一者。處今日之世界人民不分老幼，均須有</p>
<h3>無線電常識（二）</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>（二）何謂電波</p>
<p>無缐電旣不藉電綫傳播，那末牠到底是什麽東西呢？在這裏我可以有一個比仿，諸位試用一塊石子投到池水中去，看看情形是怎樣？在石塊落下的一刹那，水面受到了激盪，便見有波浪生起來，一圈一圈的向四面八方傳播開去。漸漸地遠在波頭也漸漸地低起來，直到完全平靜爲止。如果在這個發生波浪的圈内，放一塊浮起的木片，那木片受了激盪，一定也會上上下下的浮動。試想石塊和木片並没有繩子連繫着。牠們所以能夠發生關係，是全靠波浪來傳遞。無線電也是一樣，是藉電波來傳遞。不過水波是可見的，電波是不可見的。水波的發生是原于石塊的動作，而無線電波的發生是原于電氣的動作。傳播水波的是水，而傳播電波的則是目不可見的［以太］（Ｅtbcr）罷了。以太是什麽東西，到現在還没有明瞭，但學者爲解釋便利起見，假定在宇宙中迷漫着這個以太。有如地球上面迷漫着空氣一般。</p>
<p>水波發生的情形，我們細細地觀察，牠是有起伏的。一起一伏，我們把牠做一週。同樣電波的一起一伏，也呌做一週。（Ｃycle）水波週的長度，呌做波長。（ＷaveLenth）電波亦一然，水波的週率是要看石塊投下時的情形，電波的週率也要看電氣振動的快慢。水波密則波長短，疏則波長長，電流振動速，則發生之波長短，缓則波長長。但因爲電波的行進速度和光一樣，一秒間約爲三○○○○○○○○公尺（即三○○○○○基羅米突Ｋilometer）所以只要知道了一秒間的週波數（即週率），便可知道他的波長是多少。因爲只要用週率去除三萬萬公尺的距離就好了，（上圖ＡＢＣＤＥ爲一週。自Ａ至Ｅ或自Ｂ至Ｆ，Ｈ至Ｋ均爲波長）</p>
<p>各個電臺所發電波，波長各各不同，就是他的週率各各不同。一般分電波爲下列數種。現在廣播電臺所用者，大都皆爲中波。即自二○○公尺至三○○○公尺。以下我們要講什麽是電流如何放射電波如何可以接收電波。</p>

<p>豐富之常識。此種常識在幼年可求之于書本，教科書，在智識分子，可求之于新聞雜誌，未感困難。然而内地未受教育之農夫，及終日勤勞之勞工，無此暇也。次爲娱樂，勞苦羣衆，終日繁忙。設無娱樂以致慰藉，則將失人生之樂趣。雖都會中人業餘之暇，電影戲劇，娱樂正多，不足爲慮。然鄉村之農工，又非藉無綫電不可矣。三爲報告。我國人對於國事向少問聞。國家興亡，視爲不關已事。然非眞不欲與聞也，無通聞之道也。今若以無綫電時時報告於大衆，使人民能明瞭國内外之大勢，養成其參與政治之能力，則于國家前途利益又豈可限量哉？</p>
<p>此外無綫電之天氣預報，可使農夫漁家作未雨綢繆。學術講演，可使學者文人多獲益機會。無線電體操及運動界消息之播送又寓體育訓練之旨，文學故事之講談亦復有道德教訓之効果。德育智育體育三者皆有裨益，實吾人所不可忽視者也。</p>
<p>無綫電對於民衆，旣如此其重要。故歐美各國莫不力求利用。東鄰日本更爲急起直追，全國十餘大電台早晚播送各種節目。而自滿洲事變以來，更無日不有政治講演以掩飾其侵略之野心。而使全國人民之思想，完全統一於軍閥意志之下。此種統一國民意志之方法，舍無綫電，無如是其便利矣。</p>
<p>總之無綫電之利益，不僅在于通信，在能兼爲大衆教育之利器，不但爲教育之利器，更能舉統一國論之效果。今我中國幅員如此廣大，教育程度如此低淺，人民之思想又如此散漫。此正利用無綫電之時機也。望國人注意及之。</p>
<h3>自然界中的無綫電接收機</h3>
<p>— 企</p>
<p>某種動物之能發光，發電，和發射氣味，這是比較普通而容易覺察的現象；尚有一種不易覺察的現象，便是某種動物之發射無線電波。</p>
<p>我們知道家鴿被放於遠處，能夠逕自飛回原處。蝙蝠的目力是很衰弱的，可是牠能於夜間捕食小蟲。又據動物學家告訴我們，挪威高山上的旅鼠，在寒季來臨時，常成羣結隊，離開牠們的剿穴而作長途旅行，且常循直線向一定的目的地進發，宛如識途老馬。</p>
<p>這些神秘事象頗不能獲得確切滿意的解釋。據法國無線電專家拉可塞斯基的意見，某種動物確具有發射及接收無綫電波的能力。昆蟲的觸鬚恰似礦石收音機裏的觸針（ＣatsＷhisker），有檢取電磁波的功能，又多數動物的内耳中有一特殊器官，由三段半圓形的管道搆成。據説這器官具有指示方向的能力，動物失掉牠時，便茫茫然不辨方向，如墮五里霧中。最有趣的，上述管道内含有一種極易感應磁力的液質。我們知道無線電播音器能於其四周産生可變磁塲，那麽我們竟可説那半圓形管道便是能夠感應此種磁力變化的無線電收音機！</p>
<p>根據此説，前述的幾種神秘事象可以解釋如左：</p>
<p>（一）家鴿在飛起時以其身體與空氣摩擦而生電，隨即上昇或下降，在牠的身體和地面之間形成一可變電容器，待至達到相當的平衡時，便横空飛。此種天然電容器便是兩地交通的連鎖。</p>
<p>（二）蝙蝠能於夜間捕食昆蟲，乃藉後者所發射的某種電磁波以爲目標。</p>
<p>（三）旅鼠能對準遠隔的目的地前進，是以該處魚類所發射的無線電波爲目標。</p>
<p>此種假説是否可靠，尚有待於無綫電學家與生物學家的合力研究，或能獲得切實的解答。茲姑誌之，聊供飯後茶餘之談助云耳。</p>
<h3>天線之種種</h3>
<p>— 金雲樵</p>
<p>（一）天線對於無線電機之作用</p>
<p>天綫之命名，專指屋外高架導綫而言，至今日無綫電學進步，與發電站相近之處，或具有高週率擴大之收音機，均可運用屋内天綫。（用屋内天綫之收音機，其高週率擴大部份，應較用屋外天線者爲强，級數須酌量增加，否則難獲美滿效果。）或竟舍屋内者亦免除不用之。</p>
<p>天綫西文爲Ａntenna，譯意爲蟲類觸角，其於無綫電機之重要可知，廣播台之音樂言語，經播音機話筒及眞空管等之工作，藉天綫發佈高週率之無綫電波，再以空氣中以太之傳遞，無遠弗届。收音站之天綫，吸受此電波後，傳入收音機，吾人祗須增减收音機中誘導綫圈之誘導率，及電容器之電容量，調節至與廣播站波長相同之點，使生共振作用，復經檢波器，將高週率電流，改爲低週率，入聽筒工擴音器，而即成聲浪天綫旣係相當長度之導綫所構成，故有儲電性及誘導性，其與地綫之相互爲用，不　一大電容器，以中間空氣絶緣。按電容景定例，二個金屬片之距離愈近，電容量愈大，面積小，則電容量亦小，否則反是。是故天綫愈高，則容量愈小，但誘發之電壓加强。天綫愈長，則電容量愈大。無綫電波之調節收受，電容量與誘導率之作用居多，收音機之靈敏與否，均繫於此。（未完）</p>

<h3>鄉村中的無線電</h3>
<p>意大利首相莫索利尼最近開辦了一個很重要的農業展覽會，其最主要的目的，爲勸誘農民於農塲中設備無綫電機。他的意思，以爲有無缐電機在旁，則農民恍各各置身於城市，可藉此以與城市中人討論其産物的價格，並且可以知道如何改良他們所用的器具，他把無線電機，視爲農業器具的一種。</p>

<h3>一只經濟的交流三管機</h3>
<p>— 任鑫雨</p>
<p>在現在收音機傾向交流化的趨勢下，我想有許多的業餘研究者，很想做一只交流機來玩玩。因爲交流機不僅是管理簡便，經常費低廉，而且効力亦比較好些；不過裝置較繁，價值稍貴，因此有許多研究者，就望而却步，不敢領教。我最近做了一只三管機，雖然僅有一級檢波和一級低週率放大，但是音量很大，選擇性亦還好，而且價值很低廉。一般經濟的同志，很值得試一試。現在把我的經過寫些出來，我想也好供儲位的參考吧。眞空管用二二七二隻，二一○Ａ一隻。</p>
<p>線路和另件如附圖</p>
<p>調整缐圈用一時内徑蛛網板，以二四號線繞六十三圈，每九圈分一頭再生綫圈用同號綫繞四十五圈，裝於推拉架上以便進退。</p>
<p>電源變壓器鐵心用一時正方斷面積，初级用三○號繞一千八百圈；供給二只二二七絲極電流用一六號綫二根並行繞二十三圈，十一圈半處抽一中心分綫；供給二○一用二四號綫四十五圈，中間亦抽一分綫：高壓綫圈用三八號綫繞一千六百圈；每層的中間須以蠟紙隔好，初級和每個次级間須多繞幾層蠟纸。扼制綫圈以舊低週率方棚次級二只串接亦可，或用三○Ｈ、的裝品。</p>
<p>機件裝妥後，倘覺得選擇性不滿意，可以把天綫回路中之電容器容量開少一些，雖然音度减輕，不過選擇性增加不少。電源的進綫和絲機的接綫，須用絞合的花綫，否則恐有極大之交流聲；虹</p>
<p>倘外面再套上紫銅軟套而通地，那末交流聲更加减少。電源部的鐵心，亦須通地。以免互相誘導。當我聽了這收音機數大後，覺得長波長一方面，音量很輕，用種種方法來改進，皆無効果。後來在天地綫上加一綫圈，用三吋徑繞五十圈，每五圈出一頭，一端接天綫一端接地綫。再將天綫接至天綫接綫柱，地綫不接。如此一接，不僅長波方面，加響許多，而且短的方面，亦響了許多。但是過了幾天又覺得音質不好，尤其是女聲容易失眞。偶然想到分路電容器的重要，所以在Ｂ＋Ｄet和Ｂ丨間加一ＩＭＦ電容器，果然音質就改進了許多，更在附圖的Ｘ處加一高週率扼制線圈，製法是這樣：預備二塊膠木板，將他銼成圓形，直徑一時，再以毛筆的竹套，約有三四分直徑的，截成三分長，夾在兩小圓板的中間，用螺絲絞緊。好像人力車的輪子一樣，在後用三八號線繞在竹管上約一千七百圈。另用一電容器，一端通至扼制線圈，一端通至地綫。這樣一來，我覺得音量和選擇性都增加了些。現在我對這只收音機的改進，可算告一段落，將來再有所得，再來告訴諸位。這只收音機的材料，除去眞空管和銅絲外，都有國貨可買，無綫電同志，不妨一試。</p>

<h3>論亡國奴之類</h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>熱河失守，一般土大夫之類，據説要預備做亡國奴了。我覺得這未免有些唐詰訶德底勇敢。</p>
<p>唐詰訶德於和風車大决戰以前，是曾經把旅店當作了王城，把旅店主人當作了帝王，受過骑士的册封的。現在，居然有一批土大夫，要把這秋葉般的版圖，當作自己的國家，來受日本木屐兒［亡國奴］底册封。那眞是無獨有偶的唐吉訶德了。</p>
<p>去年一二八戰事起來，在漢口時，曾經聽到過一個高級軍官説過：咱們目前的大患，並不是日本人。咱們情願把漢口讓日本人佔去，但决不願讓ＸＸ軍佔領。這話，在我想來，確是至理名言。固然那位高級軍官，自有他的立塲。明白地説，便是漢口給日本人佔領了，他還可以做他的軍官；張海鵬可不是前例嗎？然而給ＸＸ軍佔領了，這是怎麽一會事呢。很顯然，他是有頭腦搬家的危險。他底階級意識是很正確的。</p>
<p>但從另一方面想，中國已無所謂國家那樣的東西，至少也得把中國放在括弧裏。但自從鴉片戰爭以來，帝國主義早已局部的把中國收作了自己的殖民地。東三省並不是亡自九一八，而是早已亡在九一八以前了。　中國之亡，也不是將從今日始，而是早已亡在各個帝國主義者手裏了。一切統治者之成其爲統治者，都是受過各帝國主義册封的。誰能説明熱河之戰，是咱們民衆不甘做亡國奴的表示呢？誰能指出這不是各個受册封的唐詰訶德之混戰呢？那麽因熱河失守而一般士大夫之類，想受亡國奴底册封，那實在未免落後了一步。而且實際上，已經戴上了［曾祖父傳下來，丢在屋角好久了的，上了銹的一頂鎧帽］的士大夫之類，没有再向木屐兒請領第二次册封的必要。</p>
<p>爲今之計，士大夫們還不如仍舊跟那些像湯玉麟之類的人物，實行搬家，搬到熱河，甚至於遼寗去住爲是。至於别有高見的大人先生們，想把自己房屋打掃乾乾淨淨，不使［小鼠］跳梁，歡迎矮子碧眼兒直脚鬼等類人物來痛飲一次［瓜分宴］。那不過徒然學了唐吉訶德的乖，把風車當作了巨人；而其結果是：［他以　遮身，提槍帶馬，向第一個風車追馳而去，將手中的槍剌入車蓬。風車以猛烈之勢，捲槍而去。瞬息之間，槍桿　　折碎。骑士與馬，隨槍投擲於原野之上，圑圑　轉，而倒於地。］</p>
<p>如斯而已。則那時候，士大夫之類，再搬回家來，向風車之類再受亡國奴底册封，實覺更爲妥當了。</p>
<h3>哀湯玉麟</h3>
<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>熱河畢竟又［失守］了，據某要人説：［報河失守是意料中事，］丨丨自然，誰也知道這是［意料中事，］然而這［意料中事］現在却累得我們的湯玉麟主席成爲一個衆矢所集的箭靶，而且遭受明令［撤職查辦］了。</p>
<p>假如湯玉麟之被撤職查辦是在熱河［失守］以前，而所以撤職查辦是爲了他在熱河舉辦苛捐雜税，是爲了他在熱河勒種鴉片，是爲了他在熱河製販紅丸嗎啡海洛因，是爲了他在熱河敲骨吸　，殘民以逞，我們到免不了會要拍掌稱快。然而這事實却是發生在熱河［失守］以後，原因又不是爲了上述種種，而是爲了熱河失守一［意料中事，］那末，湯玉麟之被免職查辦，是寃枉的，事至可哀！</p>
<p>爲什麽我們説湯玉麟之被撤職查辦是［寃枉］呢？撤職查辦不是爲了他［不抵抗］嗎？不是爲了他［棄城潛逃］嗎？但是遼吉黑三省的陷落是應該誰負責任呢？錦州榆關的陷落又是應該誰負責任呢？我們的少帥一直到現在還不是手握大兵安居北平跳舞聽京戲打哥爾夫嗎？爲什麽我們的湯主席便該撤職查辦呢？</p>
<p>不過，話説回頭，我們的湯主席究竟是有［罪］的，他的罪不在於［不抵抗］與［棄城潛逃，］而是在於不善運用［抵抗的策略，］兩年來的事實竟没曾教乖我們的湯主席，就以這一點而言，湯玉麟也就蠢不容於死了。</p>
<p>我們爲湯主席打算，他的定盤［抵抗計劃］應該是這樣的</p>
<p>第一時期：（日軍有侵熱模樣）通電全國，表示［抵抗决心］：發表談話，表示［誓死守土］，慷慨激昂，務使全國［人民］都絶對的相信。</p>
<p>第二時期：（日軍實行進攻）一面交涉，一面抵抗，即一面對日提出［嚴重抗議，］以［一切責任應由日方負之］的硬話［嚇］日軍一下。如果日軍硬［嚇］不退，便另一面也得抛下烟槍，擺開陣勢，表示［抵抗］即使因此而會犠牲幾個人，但無論如何，决犠牲不到自己的名下。</p>
<p>第三時期：（日軍愈逼愈近）在外交上電訴國聯及華盛頓，請求主持公道：在戰略上，成立新陣地，［誘敵深入，］以一舉而殲滅之；在宣傳上，通電全國，報告我軍斬俘敵逆若干，并報告前方缺少什麽，呼籲［人民］共赴國難，踴躍捐輸。</p>
<p>第四時期：（當然是日軍再逼近）通電乞援，通電［反攻］，再成立新陣地，誘敵深入。······</p>
<p>第五時期：（前方戰况不明）［避免重大犠牲］退守第Ｘ道防線。</p>
<p>第六時期：捆載子女玉帛，退至北平，通電全國，［準備長期抵抗。］</p>
<p>假使按照這樣的［抵抗計劃］去［抵抗，我們的湯主席怕不會馬上成爲［民族英雄］嗎？而且過去許多［民族英雄］的花冠，不就是如此這般作成的嗎？然而他不這樣，偏要乾脆地棄城潛逃，蠢到這樣的地步，其遭受免職查辦不是活該的嗎？</p>
<p>不過湯玉麟究竟是已經［逃］了，而且逃得［不知下落］了，那末讀一個不知下落的湯玉麟來一　担承這一［意料中事一的總賬，究竟是於大家有益的事，否則這一筆賬將算在誰的頭上好呢？</p>
<h3>燕子</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>是黃昏掛到林梢的時候，天邊有一層紫色的薄　，淡淡的，像季節夢似的。慢慢地走着，走到一道小河旁邊，靠着椅欄，我站定了。一陣輕風吹來丨我知道這是初春的風。記憶那麽温柔的風，跟着風飄來的是一兩聲遠處天主教堂的晚鐘。教堂頂上白色的十字架靜靜地合着掌，在廣闊的紫空下祈禱着，像一個白道衣的聖處女似地。</p>
<p>一線夕陽從前面那枝老柳樹的葉子裏漏下來，照到我髮際，我的頭髮是呌風給吹亂了的。便低低地吹着口笛，笑着。那麽靜謚的，愉快的黃昏呀！</p>
<p>忽然我聽見輕悄的絮語，呢呢喃喃地。抬起腦袋來，却見老柳樹的葉子裏站着兩隻紫色的燕子，輕盈地撲着翅膀，在那兒説着他們南國的私語。</p>
<p>我望着這對燕子，我認識牠們的。牠們和玲姑娘一同地存在我的記憶裏邉，玲姑娘已經悄悄地躺到萬國公墓裏一塊寫着，［愛女歐陽玲之墓］的大理石下面，牠們可又回來了。三年前，我也時常看見這對紫燕的。那時也是春天，也是那麽温柔的風，也是那麽靜謚的黃昏，也是那麽聖潔的白十字架，也是那麽幽遠的天主教堂的晚鐘，我和玲姑娘慢慢地散着步，在這郊外的瀝青路上。田野裏有麥的香味，有布穀鳥的雙重的聲音，有松脂的焦香，有平靜的天空，平靜的陽光丨在平靜的天空，平靜的陽光下，爛熟的菓子會平靜地跌下來。我們會坐到草地上，坐到石埠上，坐到落花上，坐到樹根上，我們會靠着橋欄站下來，我也會輕輕地吹着口笛，笑着。那對燕子便站在我們腦袋上面的柳條裏絮絮地訴説着，玲姑娘也會燕子那麽地跟我絮絮地訴説着。她會説燕子的話，呢呢喃喃地，她也懂得南國的私語，因爲她説：</p>
<p>［我也是南國的女兒呢！］</p>
<p>她又説，南方是有着許多許多的紫燕的，時常會站到她的窗口跟她談着家鄉的風景的。她説，有好幾次，她早上起來，去開窗時，會有雛燕撲進來，撲到她身上，哆嗦着。她還説，南方是除了燕子之外，還有紅豆，藍海，青天，白的建築，和菓園的。</p>
<p>她　是在生着懷鄉的病呵！我知道她總有一天會回去的。</p>
<p>那年夏天，她眞的回去了，和一對紫燕一同地。現在紫燕已經回來過兩次了，可是玲姑娘呢？玲姑娘在那兒呢？又是春天了，又是那麽可愛的黃昏呵！　　月亮上來了，在柳梢頭，在紫燕的嘴上。</p>
<p>我想，明天該會下雨的。果然，在那天半晚上，蕭蕭地從窗外飄進三兩聲細雨來，飄到我的愁思裏，飄到我的夢裏。</p>

<h3>黑女求神記（二十四</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>這樣的女神是没有的，］造像的人説。［除了我所造的那些以外，就没有别的什麽神女成神了；我從未造過名呌　　的女神呢。］</p>
<p>［她的的確確存在着，］黑女孩子説：［因爲哪個白小姐是用了尊敬的口吻講起她，説是宇宙的　匙是她的女性的根，這是同數一樣没有形體的，這又是在太初以前，不是在那以後，比如神是在創始以前，這不是　　的性，這自女　　起來幾成爲　　的性。太初一定就是這　的一種東西，當我們回歸牠從中造出我們來　　土去的時候，那還留　着的一定就是這樣　一種東西。我從幼小時候就默想着個個的數，　異着一　　數怎樣到來；因爲另外一切的數都只是多少個一加多少個一　了；可是一是什麽？我却想不出來。現在我從　　，知道一是自身所增殖，而並非結婚的配偶所增殖的東西。那麽你有了一，就知道太初和終末所以没有的緣故了；因爲你少一，再少一，再少一的數下去，决數不到太初，你多一，再多一，再多一的數上去，决數不到終極的，照此，你從數上　找得到永久的。］</p>
<p>［單獨的永久本身是虚無，］亞拉伯人説。［如果我找不到永久的眞理，那麽永久於我有什麽意思呢？］</p>
<p>［只有數的眞理　是永久的，］黑女孩子説。［别的一切眞理同我們幼小時候的幻想一樣，不是過去了，就是成爲錯誤了，然而一加一是二，一加十是十一，却永遠是這樣的。所以我覺得數這里有着一種神樣的什麽東西。］</p>
<p>［你不能吃，不能喝數的，］造像的人説。［你不能和牠結婚的。］</p>
<p>［神備着另外的東西給我們吃，給我們喝呢，我們彼此可以結婚的，］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［哦，你總畫不出牠的形狀來，另外不消説得了。］造像的人説。</p>
<p>［我們亞拉伯人　　的，憑了這記號，我們要征服世界了。你看！］亞拉伯人説。於是他　下身去，在沙上寫了幾個數目字。</p>
<p>［教士説的，神就是三在一　，一在三裏這一種魔術的數，］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［這是簡單的］亞拉伯人説，［我是我父親的兒子，我兒子們的父親連同我自己，三在一裏，一在三裏。人的天性是多方面的，惟有上帝是一。他是一體。他是，照你所説，本身由本身增殖的一種東西。他是　的心，虚空的中心，要是没有這個，那就不會有什麽身體的了。他是不可勝數的星的數，不可　量的氣的量！</p>

<h3>安靜的紗花市面</h3>
<p>紗市平定、形勢尚硬、因美棉無市、多頭吸收之額、始終不鬆、但實需亦靜、各帮受經濟困難、採辦力甚弱、至於賣方逢漲必出、目前有一部份以美國物價有趨高之望、做多心念未絶、不過存底太厚、壓力較重云、</p>
<p>（紗後市稍有做多者）人標前市開盤、美棉繼續停市、人氣平平、聞印棉微跌、各月跌二三錢、二三盤又回漲、結果各月漲跌一二錢、午後有一部份購買做多、各月漲三四六錢、全日成交統計一萬零五百包、查賣出椿記五百五十包、大昌成六百包、　大四百包、仁豐五百包、買進明德一千一百包、昶記八百五十包、大昶六百包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>期麥被標粉牽動</p>
<p>昨期麥上午開盤後、各月份市極清淡、祇三七月份略有交易、餘均空拍、迨至下午開盤、以洋麥報價旣小、上午粉市、亦見大　、因此人心不佳、抛　見暢、此種情形、純爲粉市所帶動、因買户均屬外行、無實在收貨之能力耳、結果本月份較小三分、四月份小一分、七月份小三分、八月份小二分、</p>
<h3>坎麥報小標粉慘落</h3>
<p>丨津帮與廠家紛紛出檔丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份一致呈慘落之象、以坎麥報價、又小三角左右、且自金價暴降以來、似又爲洋麥兜銷之機會、澳麥喊價竟低至三兩三錢八分、而北方局勢、雖已轉危爲安、不過全般局勢、依然未許樂觀、故津帮上下各市、均有出檔、大小廠家、亦因洋麥之鬆動、及尚有餘　籌碼、均陸續暢出、所以人心大虚、紛紛脱手、一般投機浮空、亦儘量出檔、致各月份之跌勢、頗覺可觀、此後觀察、如洋麥　濫、或尚有　鬆之象、結果三四月份較前日跌一分半、五月份跌二分二厘半、六七月份跌二分半、八月份跌二分、</p>

<p>（洋米）交易續見活潑、又由英商祥茂洋行售與糧商新陳小絞一萬包、仍係躉批交易、作客聞仍爲軍需去化、而經手行家與售出方面、則並不宣布其去路、但本街與閩帮胃口當無如此之多、陳小絞計五千包、價仍係七元四角半、新小絞五千包、爲中關貨、價比昨開别去二角、爲七元五角半、</p>
<p>（客秈）到頭昨無　票抵埠、惟銷　轉淡、統市開出不到三千包、行情略見拉小、計開江西機晚一千包、價八元半至八元四角半、湖南機油米七百四十包、價八元五角八分至八元五角半、又機紅米六百包、價八元四角二分、又機靖米四百包、價七元六角四分、機油機靖爲本街辦去、其餘均爲　帮辦裝云、</p>

<h3>婺源茶業蕭索</h3>
<p>婺源茶業，年來因受俄莊貢熙銷路減退、與各路克兢製抽芯影響、致商家大受虧折邇來更因茶棧放欵緊縮、資本薄弱、號家勢難維持、預料本年該路茶號、較去年減少五六十家、且多縮小營業範圍、茶業之蕭索、已可槪見、惟聞婺源帮茶商、一部份認爲婺源茶業欲圖生存、非限期提早採摘不可、現正猛烈進行運動、以期實現云、</p>

<p>路透十日華盛頓電羅斯福總統昨獲勝利後、今再接再厲開始攻擊其經濟議案中退役軍士恩給金之付項、該議案已於今日在參院提出、案中請國會准許立即削減此費、若輩非完全喪失服務能力、而亦有盡可稽云、總統雖未説明詳細辦法、但據半官估計、每年可節省三○○·○○○·○○○元、羅總統又請國會准其削減政府公務員之俸金、至高以百分之十五爲限、綜計每年可因此節省四五萬萬元、查一九三三年財政年度國用之短少、大約將超過一·二○○·○·○○○元、（金融善後社借出之欵不在内、）一九三四年之國用、若不即取行動、則短少之數將在一·○○○·○○○·○○○元左右、且在春季须償還政府短期公債數萬萬元、故改革益急不容緩云、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯十日日内瓦電國社黨衝鋒隊佔據蓋爾營房一事、軍縮會議休息室中、評論甚盛、謂軍事性質之圑體佔據蓋爾營房、系德國政府利用此　圑體之發端、軍額委員會現正討論何種軍事圑體、應計算在兵額之内、此項問題、可於蓋爾事件中得到答復矣、休息室中有人追憶蕯爾地方委員會曾用國聯會名義、禁止衝鋒隊在蕯爾地方演習、又有人提及凡爾賽條約第四十三條之規定、謂萊茵河左岸全部、及右岸由河岸起往東五十公里以内一帶地方、所有德國軍事演習、以及軍隊駐紥或集合、不論久暫槪行禁止云、</p>

<h3>宋子文今晨談話</h3>
<p>全國總動員抵抗到底</p>
<p>莊委員長决定坐鎭華北主持</p>
<p>閻馮西南抗日一致無分畛域</p>
<p>妥協直接交涉均爲日方空氣</p>
<p>兩國戰爭不能以軍械作比例</p>
<p>代理行政院長宋子文、前乘飛機北上、參與保定會議、决定華北軍事財政大計後、昨日下午二時、乘原機返滬、本報記者今晨十一時、特往祁齊路寓邸訪晤、宋氏謂、華北軍事計劃、業已决定、無論如何、决抵抗到底、即或日軍可攻下南京、而抵抗决心、絲毫不變、並力闢外間妥協、直接交涉、中立區等謡傳、謂在此情况之下、絶對無談判之可言、態度異常激昂、茲分紀其談话於次、</p>
<h3>口外戰事劇烈</h3>
<p>記者首詢以華北最近情形何如、宋氏答稱、古北口外戰事異常劇烈、孫殿英軍隊亦正在　塲一帶、與敵　命、孫部軍械軍常窳敗、而又能與敵肉搏、致敵重創、士卒忠勇、誠堪嘉尚、至孫部後方、可由多倫接濟、未被日軍截斷、不至受敵包圍、</p>
<h3>决定軍事計劃</h3>
<p>又詢以保定會議結果如何、據答、余及蔣委員長·張漢卿、在保定會晤、係討論華北軍事財政計劃、已大致决定、至張學良辭職照准事、現中央尚無明令、又問東北軍調後方、中央軍隊調赴前線等之佈置、是否亦在會議中决定、據答、現在抗日、全國軍人一致、根本無所謂東北軍中央軍等之區别、</p>
<h3>閻馮一致抗日</h3>
<p>又問、閻馮態度何如、擬與蔣委員長會見否、宋答、閻代表徐永昌、今次曾在石家莊、與蔣委員長會晤、結果至爲圓滿、馮先生　主　極抵抗、故軍事計劃完全贊同、又問閻馮在張家口組織民圑、擬親赴前線殺敵何如、宋謂尚無所聞、問馮是否出任抗日軍事工作、及用何名義、答謂、本人未詳</p>
<h3>全國軍人殺敵</h3>
<p>問西南出兵抗日能實現否、答、現在全國完全一致對外、各省隊伍、均願開赴前線殺敵、更無分西南中央、軍人在前線殺敵、希望後方民衆、亦當積極進行抗日工作、上下圑結、協力應付此空前之國難、</p>
<h3>英使斡旋不確</h3>
<p>問、路透電傳、英使　溥森又將出任斡旋、日方提出劃榆關至古北口長城一帶、爲中立區、此事有所聞否、答謂、絶對無此事、在現在情况之下、妥協直接交涉等、均爲日方所放出之空氣、緩和國際視聽、我無論如何、抵抗到底、日軍所至、抵抗隨之、即或日軍可攻下南京、而抵抗决心及軍事計劃不變、</p>
<h3>與敵作一死拚</h3>
<p>問、院長前次發表談話中、謂我國軍隊是十七八世紀時、不能與日軍作戰、則今次抵抗、恐又將蹈熱河之覆轍、尊意如何、宋氏毅然答稱、此正余最强硬之表示蓋抵抗之者、不能以勝敗而論、勝回可喜、敗亦繼續作戰、且余所謂十七八世紀軍隊者、　指湯玉麟　部而言、全國優良軍隊正多、不能一槪而論、　當以熱河事爲前車、將我國軍隊之弱點、加以改良、然後可以殺敵致勝、至兩國之戰爭、又絶對不能以軍械之利窳、軍隊之强弱、作精密之觀察、假令德國有六寸徑大砲、較法國多數日門、則法國是否因此而屈服、又如英國戰鬥艦數倍於日本、日本是否即投降、故以軍械軍隊力量作比較、則兩國無戰爭之可言、我國情形正復如此、當以民族之勇氣、一致之圑結、與敵作一死拚、以民族之血肉、打開出路、故今日者、正我國唯一之復興機會、死生存亡、在此一舉也、</p>
<h3>宋氏暫不北上</h3>
<p>宋氏又谓自汪院長出國後、由余代理院務、現汪院長將于十七日返國抵滬、以後一切政治大計、負責有人、余當　致力于籌劃財政矣、故暫不北上、蔣軍事委員會長、擬常駐華北、指揮軍事、至華北之軍費、雖不能十分富裕、然已可應付云、</p>
<h3>懲辦失職將領</h3>
<p>熱河陷落、負責將領之懲辦問題、湯玉麟業經政府負責緝辦、至其他張作相等將領、余因在北方逗留時間甚暫未與蔣張等詳談、未悉如何辦法、總之、中央必有最公平之處置、以明賞罰、維持紀　、振奮士氣也</p>
<h3>收復失地計劃</h3>
<p>記者又詢、中央所謂軍事計劃、是否僅抵抗而止、收復失地如何進行、擬反攻承德否、據答、蔣委員長之抵抗决心已詳在鄭州與新聞記者之談話、至收復失地及反攻承德、須視軍進展如何而定、余非軍事專家、詳細計劃、不得而知、</p>
<h3>張學良來滬訉</h3>
<p>今日盛傳張學良乘飛機來滬説、記者最　舉此相詢、宋謂、今晨尚無電報來滬、又問平津情形、十分緊張、日軍究竟有無　華北模樣、答稱、吾人不問日軍進展如何、日軍所至、即抵抗隨之、中央蓋已抱有萬分之决心矣云云、</p>
<h3>曾仲鳴今晨赴港迎汪</h3>

<h3>軍縮會前途黯澹</h3>
<p>法德見解大相牴牾</p>
<p>英國斡旋極感困難</p>
<p>路透社十日内瓦電軍縮會前途之黑暗、及協定氣象之無望、從未有如今日之甚者、而英相麥唐納乃適將於此時蒞臨日内瓦、軍縮任何重要事件、輒見法德間意見之完全僵局、雙方皆無稍予讓步之表示、德國以爲德國旣已解除武裝、自不負責任、渠所要求者、無論軍備或軍縮、總須平等耳、法國則謂法國軍縮之程度、須爲法國所得安全之程度所支配云、雙方見解之牴觸、在在於大會中任何問題上見之、固不論其所討論者爲兵額·戰具·空軍或廢戰問題也、尤有使英相工作困難者、爲德法意三國負責大員之缺席、德國非俟獲有具體提案、不願遣　總理巴本或外長牛賴特出席、法總理達拉第亦不願冒在日内瓦爲英美意三國聯合包圍之危險、意國雖表示極同情之注意、但並未明白宣佈其贊助德國之决心、不過汎繫黨最高會議之最近决議、曾徵實　國此種立塲耳、同時波蘭與蘇俄　　　意的接近、現已顯著、此事現亦導成法俄間更密切之諒解、其所以有此變化者、則以德總理希特勒之反共行動有以促成之也、統觀上述種種情勢、英相麥唐納欲獲若何形式、或輔以軍備休戰之協定耳、顧即此辦法、德國亦必竭力反對之、是以前途至爲黯淡也、</p>
<h3>英當局離巴黎赴日内瓦</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>也來替湯主席呼寃</h3>
<p>— 小夥子</p>
<p>在三日就全部斷送而我們直到六日才在報紙上讀到的熱河，據説，現在已在太陽光的暴烈映射下懸上了甚麽［幾條顔色］而且［角上有一只甚麽星］的旗幟了。又據説，此次改懸旗幟之如此神速，這功勞全該歸功於我們的湯主席，玉麟將軍丨因爲若不是我們的湯主席在不到十天之内很慷慨乾脆的把熱河送掉，老百姓們不是吃苦受嚇至少要在十天以上嗎？此日此時還能夠再度着這昇平的生活？而且照理説照［觀一塲戲］（註）便失去東北政治樞紐的瀋陽因以丢掉整個東三省而倒做着綏靖主任兼代軍分會委員長的天經地義萬古不磨滅的定理來説，我們的湯主席縱不獲升賞，亦不應該有罪。然而，這次，我們的湯主席却大大的上了老當啊！先是觸怒了張主任兼代委長，駡他畏葸棄職，不抵抗而失承德致貽誤國際之羞，主張通缉拿辦處以槍决！隨後，監察院提出彈劾；行政院也决議嚴辦；八日國府又是明令通緝！新聞界也趁火凑熱閙，口伐筆誅，大打其落水之狗！嗚呼呀丨丨這只狗丨我們的湯主席只輕輕走錯了這一着小棋子，便值得這樣逼迫他感着頭頭不是道嗎？如果逼出人命來，豈不寃哉？那將又怎樣交代呢？·······</p>
<p>不特此也。中國人的特嗜好打落水狗，殊不知外國人也喜歡此道，你看，申報八日天津專電：</p>
<p>湯玉麟在豐寗割鬚毁容，化裝農民，雜入難民隊中，混入古北口，乘汽車到天津郊外，步行入法租界，因風聲緊，又入英租界，寓址已數遷，法工部局將各報所登湯氏照片剪下，送交各旅館各飯店令注意旅客有類似照片者，速向工部局報告並派警往湯弟玉山家查抄搜出烟土一萬數千兩，手槍十餘支，湯弟當塲被捕，手脚帶刑具連同違禁物，一併逮入法工部局，家族四散逃亡，狀極狼狽！</p>
<p>可恨外國人老會尋倒霉的人開心，我們的湯主席這時困苦狼狽的情狀，閉上眼睛，自然心領神會而不宣，那，我們就應該如何跪頭泣血爲我們的湯主席呼寃啊！理由是：（一）熱河之失在缺乏整個防守計劃，中央地方互相依靠，我們的湯主席的屁股只［主］其［席］那裏還管得了這許多？（二）熱河政治太壞，民心早失，我們的湯主席又没有起死回生之術，偷天换日之能，怎能挽回這已去的局面？（三）軍隊系統複雜，而且義勇軍又不肯出力拚命去打頭陣，我們的湯主席只有一雙手，兩條腿，逃起命來都趕不及，那裏能夠塞得了敵人的槍眼兒？（以上根據張主任兼代軍委長的親信所談，丨見九日申報號外丨而體會出來的理由）（四）有些人説，兩個月前不該只配兩圑兵在山海關，致先送去山海關，山海關一丢，熱河不已成爲籠中之鳥，　裏的　了嗎？（五）像湯主席這樣的狗，自全國内不止湯主席一隻，</p>
<p>根據以上五條强有力的理由，我并發現見以下這兩個至眞至理的結論：（一）打落水狗，罪孽深重，（二）打落水狗，不算英雄</p>
<p>（附註）監委高友唐彈劾張學良文中有［當倭軍砲攻北大營時，參謀長榮臻由瀋陽四次電話請示應付方針，張學良方在中和戲園觀劇，直至曲終返寓，瀋陽已陷·····］</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>烟草精Ｎicotine</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>香烟之爲害，幾乎盡人皆知，因其中所含之毒質，足以敗人之潛力，汲人之生氣，鈍人之感覺，死人之心思，舉凡人之壯志，智能，及精深之澈悟，皆可因吸香烟而消解以盡·其爲害之烈，實令人怵目驚心！</p>
<p>查香烟含有十八種毒質，而其中最毒者，莫過於烟草精（即尼哥丁）此物爲尋常食物中所未有，亦不列入生物原形質Ｐrotoplasm中，現將其略述如下：（一）烟草精之所在</p>
<p>烟草精又名菸　，在有機化上，屬於植物鹼類Ａlkalaids中，常與蘋菓酸Ｍalicacid构橼酸Ｃitricacid化合而爲有機鹽，存留於烟茶及其子實中，其含量約○·２８　，普通香烟品質良者約含２　劣者則有　矣。</p>
<p>（二）烟草精之提取</p>
<p>烟葉中之烟草精，可用下法以提取之：將烟葉浸於熱水中，煑之，和以石灰乳Ｍilkoflime入蒸　瓶中運以冷凝器及受器，後將其之蒸餾液，加入草酸Ｏxalicacid使成酸性，再蒸發使濃，加輕養化鉀Ｐotassiumbydcoxide將其分解，即可得游離之烟草精，可用醚Ｅ·rb</p>
<p>er抽出之。</p>
<p>普通實騐室中則用下法以試騐，</p>
<p>取香烟一支，水２５ＣＣ，稀硫酸２ＣＣ，置於小蒸餾瓶中，加熱使沸，十分鐘後，加入過呈之輕養化納Ｓodiumbydrodai</p>
<p>de深液，蒸餾之，後取其蒸餾液再加各種之試騐。</p>
<p>（三）烟草精之性質</p>
<p>烟草精爲赤色油狀液體，熱至２４７</p>
<p>oＣ時沸騰有强烈之剌激味及不快之臭氣，　於空氣中，即變爲黃色及褐色，終爲樹脂樣之液體，毒性甚劇，只須二三滴，在數分鐘内，即能絶人生命，易溶於水，酒精，　液，困液，及石油醚中，着火則大部分解，化爲石炭酸Ｃarbonicacid，水及氣Ｎitrogen</p>
<p>（四）烟草精之害處</p>
<p>烟中有毒已人所共知，而一般人尤爭相吸之，一若香烟即可以代替食品者，此無異自戕其之身心，魯鈍其之智慧，塞窒其之聰明，蓋烟草精一經吸入，即時流於血液，徧布於神經系，如無烟癮者吸之，則頭腦昏眩，此即神經被其麻醉之明證也，吸烟過度者，伸其指必微發　動，足見烟草精之傷壞神經，實少出其右者，尚有所謂［烟心病］Ｔobaccobeart者，犯之則脈跳浮速，究其故全由於烟草精之毒，直中心臟神經節中之神經細包所至，更有甚於此者，名爲［烟盲症］Ｔabacooblinbness，犯之者，眼明衣之某部分，失去受光之感覺，漸次於致於盲，其危險實不言可喻矣，此外烟草精尚有害於聲帶，因吸烟時，其烟之氣質或灰塵者，必經過喉頭兩聲帶</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>間之孔竅，其聲帶外衣之感覺，甚爲敏捷，久受烟氣之剌激，則漸次化爲粗厚，结果便喉音變嚘，演説或歌唱不能宏亮矣！此害尤以吸鴉片者爲甚丨除此以外吸烟者更有幾種不良之現象發生，如面黃而無血色，記憶力衰退，食量减少，夜間失眠，並且指染烟毒，滿口烟臭，耗费有用之金錢，花之於無用之地，實深慨嘆也！</p>
<p>香烟之毒害，已如上述，深望國人注意及之。</p>

<h3>蕭伯納的過慮</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>前天報載愛爾蘭幽默作家蕭伯納在北平招待記者，除申述他東來［並無任務］一文，並發表對於滿案的意見。據語路透訪員以爲［滿洲之千萬華人，必須成爲愛爾蘭式的國民黨，即每一華人須以持來復槍之日兵一人監守之，此事當然爲不能］云。</p>
<p>這個號稱幽默的愛爾蘭人，於此事誠極其洞達，談言微中，很能使人發一些苦笑。但他渡大洋過來時，似忘帶了一付眼鏡，所以對於中國的觀察，未免有點不大准確。他不具論，即如前面所説的話，也就失之樂觀。</p>
<p>咱們中國的虧夠得上稱聲大國，三千五百萬方里的土地，四萬七千四百萬的人口，外國人是常爲我們這一些數字所震驚，但大而無當，像垃圾一樣的堆積，實在是無足誇耀的。一般樂觀先生［中國不亡論］的第一個主要論點，就是［人多，］不料，外來的蕭也中了這毒。要知道在西方一百個愛爾蘭人固然不怕一百個亞洲人，但在東方二萬五千個英國人却可管理三萬五千萬的印度人。記得印度的滅亡，直接的雖是東印度公司，而簡接的却完成於印度人自己之手。倘没有那一班食［皇家］俸祿丨丨印民脂膏的印度［漢奸］丨丨土酋，我想英國人是决不能亡印度，丨丨亡了也管理不下得。我中國呢？人口是號稱四萬萬，倘照一個監一個的話，那末，至少把整個歐洲合併起來，才能對付一個中國。但請放心，事實决不如想像的　，我們多的是待價不必善丨丨而沽的漢奸，有機會，脱下長袍，换上號衣，充英格蘭水兵雖不像　　鼻子欠高，皮膚欠白，而走路也欠威武，但當［ＸＸ皇軍］却有餘，這有我們已有點經騐，蕭的話是過慮。</p>
<p>於此，我們不能不責招待人員的欠週，當蕭踏上中國海岸時，没有給他换上一付［老光］眼鏡。</p>
<h3>笑問客從何處來</h3>
<p>— 爰溪</p>
<p>吳少奶奶向來是不常外出的，因爲家中一切外交事，都由吳老太太全權辦理。</p>
<p>一日，忽的進來一位不速之客，手握竹杖，衣裳　　，形似乞丐，鬚　斑白，落落大方的便坐在客廳上位紅木椅上，嚮嚮的咳了幾聲嗽，就把斜插在領口上的旱烟袋拔出來抽烟。</p>
<p>［喂！老頭子是幹啥呢？還不出去！］少奶奶嚇得手足無措。</p>
<p>［唔！我是來找阿貴的媽媽］。接着又是嚮嚮的咳了幾聲。</p>
<p>［怎麽會找起我的婆婆來了！］少奶奶更弄得一丈二的和尚，摸不着頭腦。［媽！你看這討厭的老頭子，活菩薩樣的突然進來坐起不動！］她對着剛巧走進來的老太婆説。</p>
<p>［你找誰？］老太婆向他上下打量一番。</p>
<p>［我找你！］</p>
<p>［你姓什麽？］老太婆有些生氣。</p>
<p>［你姓什麽，我就是姓什麽，］老頭子還帶微笑。</p>
<p>［唔···］老太婆更莫明其妙的相相他的面孔，突然有所發現似的呌出半句：［這是阿貴的···］復又忍住。少娘娘更只好發呆！</p>
<p>［哈哈！你到此時才曉得是我？］他更搭出老氣横秋的架子。</p>
<p>［我不信！你得先把褂子脱去，讓我認識認識你肩上的斑痣。］看後，他便把他那件重沉沉千補萬衲的襤　褂子，擲在地上，似嗔似喜的説：［你這老東西！抛妻别子的出門三十多年，鴻飛冥冥，以爲你早已不在世了！現在回來，怎麽還是這個樣兒？］</p>
<p>［罪過罪過！你莫看不起它，我平生的血汗，就是它呀！］於是趕緊把襤　褂子拾起來，極珍惜似的緊緊抱住：［自從那年離開家鄉，到了奉天，原想去做種田生活，但又被攬頭約往黑龍江去掏金礦，地窖生活，眞苦極了！猶幸每天可以偷藏點零星金子，用以調劑工資之少，不過就是不容易帶起逃出礦區。］</p>
<p>［爲什麽信息都不有呢？］</p>
<p>［莫説我不會寫信，就會寫也不好帶。年復一年，直到東洋小鬼來佔奪礦山了，才好化裝逃回。可惜我還有大部分藏在土中不及挖出的金葉子，尤其那取之不竭的礦産丨都被東洋小鬼佔去了。唉！］</p>
<p>［金葉子！難道你一點兒都没有帶回嗎？］</p>
<p>［雖然帶回不多，但也夠我們一生一世用之不盡了！］</p>
<p>［呢？拿出眞貨來看！］</p>
<p>［這就是！］老頭子笑眯眯地復把那件重沉沉的　　褂子遞給老太婆，剪開一綹綹的敗絮，都夾着纍纍然的碎金！</p>

<p>編者先生</p>
<p>鄙人現在Ｘ香燭店爲夥，十年來月薪所入，不過可以苦度而已，前日舍親來説，他因另有高就，擬將自己經營之小店一　，讓我接辦。該店共結資本洋二千元，他想拔去一半，由　拚入資本一千元，所有店務出入，歸我一人專主。查該店地位適中，年來頗有盈餘：所以鄙意非常願意，認爲不可多得的機會。惟手中尚缺現欵二三百金，因思得鄉問祖遺基地一畝有零，價賣得欵凑數。但該地昔年由先曾祖租與沈姓使用，沈姓在該地上且搭有店面房屋兩間；並於前七年，轉租於殷姓，殷姓且亦搭有住房數問。現在沈姓年向殷姓取租金三十六元，而鄙人所得，年僅制錢四千文而已；且並無租摺單據。年來屢向加租，沈姓一味延宕迥避，始終不肯觀面一談，近更變本加厲，積欠租金，已達二年以上；鄙人忍無可忍，久想謀一解决，今因上面一件事情的緣故，於是下了决心。想責令沈殷兩姓，將房屋折讓，收回出賣。編者先生，不知道辦法妥不妥？千祈示復爲荷此請</p>

<p>編者按：劉君旣認接辦這　小店，爲不可得的機會，當然不能放過。至於缺少現欵二三百金，擬將鄉間基地出賣，作爲籌欵的辦法，自屬妥當。但據來信所説，該欵雖似乎不致落空，不過要在短時間内辦到，恐不容易，所以我們以爲，劉君一方面當然可以與沈殷兩姓交涉：一方面最好另行調度。想令親旣肯將資本不完全拔還，他必然深信於你，你可以同他商量，盈虧不妨各半享負，請他再息借二三百金，他怕不致於十分拒絶嗎？</p>
<p>至於同沈殷兩姓的租赁交涉，你旣没有租摺租據，不知你所所有權有没有其他證件，這塊地的丁漕，是不是你完的？要是全無憑證，而又不完糧，這交涉的前途，就難説了。要是你有相當證件，那末你的　有權，可以確認。不過你也不可責令他們拆讓。因爲法律規定，除非立有契約，以［成功不毁］爲原則，换言之，他們所造的房屋，你不能呌他折去。但你也不能没收他們，因爲你没有得到這種契約呀！所以即使控诸法庭，你不免要結價買他。這事情可就有出入了。所以，我們以爲，劉君似應請人向沈姓表示，願意將地讓度給他。他如其實在頑而無理，你才去進行诉訟，並且狀子裏最好也要表示願意將地讓度的意思。至於價格，那就可以由你開口，由他還價，到頭來還可由法官公評呢</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（一）醒後的呐喊</p>
<p>大中華民國ＸＸ年Ｘ月Ｘ日，丨ＸＸ節在南京，我們底首都，這是情形最嚴重的一天：如其説得再深切一些，就可以説這一日是中華民國有史以來，所從未碰到過的生死關頭。全國各地，情形是同樣的嚴重，而南京是中央政府的所在地，因此空氣更比别處緊張了。</p>
<p>在往日，南京總像一個矢志柏舟的孤孀一般一幽靜着，沉默着，花牌樓夫子廟一帶的熱閙，祇是她的偶然的，局部的微笑而已。這一日，雖然夫子廟一帶的歌唱，已在時局不寗靜之下，完全停止了，花牌樓一帶的商店，也家家高張着［表示主戰决心，全體停業一天］，的標語，把舖門關得像鐵桶一樣：但是整個的南京，已籠罩在一片緊張而熱烈的空氣之下了。守節的孤孀，一變而爲運動塲上的女選手，街上兩邊，堆起了三四尺厚的［人牆］，從下午一點鐘起，一直到晚上六七點鐘，［人牆］始終没有動摇過；一切的人，男的，女的，老的，少的，齊透着極悲憤而又極興奮的神氣，在守候，在議論。</p>
<p>［馮ＸＸ到京！蔡ＸＸ出兵···］骑脚踏車的，徒步的報販們，每隔一兩點鐘，便夾着一批新的號外，風捲殘雲似的滚過來了，已經喊啞了的噪子，還在拚性捨命的高唱着幾條重要消息的題目；五千份，一萬份，二萬份，不消二十分鐘，便給守候着的人們搶個罄盡了！</p>
<p>血一般紅，拳一般大的紅字，由各報的信差茶房高高地黏到了各馬路口的佈告牌上去，宣示着最後的消息，黏的人還不曾下來，佈告牌已陷入重圍之中了。</p>
<p>新聞記者的汽車，發狂似的在中山路上飛來飛去，白布黑字的［Ｘ報館］［Ｘ通信訊社］的旗幟，跟救火車上的警鈴，發生了同等的功效：旗飄處，一切的車輛，都很謙恭地退到了旁邊去，讓他們開足速率，盡量的去採取關於中執會臨時緊急會議底消息。</p>
<p>中報會臨時緊急會議是爲着Ｘ國送來了哀的美頓　而召集的，就定這天午後，在紫金山下總理陵園内舉行。時辰鐘打過兩下，京裏的要人，京外的要人，已全體翩然光降，準備參與這一個嚴重的集會，决定戰或和的策略。</p>
<p>［噲！幹什麽？］會議開始後不到半句鐘，總理靈前的一片大石坪裏，忽然來了一個衣服極整潔的中年人，很從容地打他自己帶來的一口小籐箱裏檢出了七八條很長很闊，寫着大字，仿彿輓聯似的白布來，逐一舖在地上，這樣就驚動了一個衛士。</p>

<h3>The Situation in North China Suddenly Declares Tensions</h3>
<p>Baoding Conference Decides on Overall Anti-Japanese Plan</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Resignation Approved, Military Affairs Fully Supervised by Chiang</p>
<p>He Yingqin Stationed in Beiping to Coordinate, Xu Tingyao to the Front Lines to Command</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Force Us to Withdraw Troops Stationed at the Great Wall, Threatening Advancement</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Baoding Conference decided to approve Zhang Xueliang's resignation. The Northeast Army, totaling sixteen brigades, has now been reorganized with different unit numbers, brigades at the front line of Yu Pass, brigades at various passes of the Great Wall, brigades in the Tianjin Tanggu area, and brigades in the Beiping Zhangjiakou Baoding area. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang issued a telegram on the evening of the 10th to step down, the telegram containing over four hundred characters, roughly stating his self-blame and resignation, requesting the Central Government to maintain his subordinates. (3 AM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang and Zhang met in Baoding at 8 PM on the 9th, Zhang proposed two solutions: (1) Each route of the Northeast Army would be led by Zhang to recover Chengde, with the Central Government responsible for support; (2) Zhang's resignation would be approved, with the Central Government fully responsible for the anti-Japanese effort. The final decision was to adopt the second solution, approving Zhang's resignation from all his concurrent posts, and he would leave Beiping immediately to facilitate a renewal of the situation and easier command. After the decision, Chiang and Zhang returned separately to Shijiazhuang. Military affairs in front of Beiping would be handled by He Yingqin in Beiping. If necessary, Chiang would come to Beiping, and He would go to the front lines to command. The Central Army has already arrived at Gubeikou, joining the front line operations, is in transit. Xu Tingyao, after Chiang and Zhang's meeting, came to Beiping with He Yingqin and will soon go to the front lines to command. The Central Government's overall anti-Japanese plan seems to have been finalized. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's resignation has been approved, and Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, has full authority over military affairs in North China. Chiang has already dispatched a division of troops to Gubeikou this morning to participate in the war. This is sufficient to demonstrate his command of military affairs. Today's events are like thunder out of a clear sky. Since Chiang has personally taken command and dispatched his direct line of troops to the battlefield, his determination to resist Japan is now clear to all. People here now generally believe that a large-scale war in North China is likely unavoidable. Zhang Xueliang is now a common citizen. According to a certain spokesperson, Zhang will leave Beiping in a few days, probably going to Shanghai first, then overseas. It is learned that during the meeting between Chiang and Zhang yesterday, Zhang proposed two options: (1) Relieve him of all posts and personally lead his sixteen brigades in the theater to recover Chengde to atone for his past mistakes; (2) Resign from all posts, including the commander of the Northeast Army, and entrust all responsibility to the Central Government. Chiang accepted his second proposal. From tonight onwards, this young man who has long borne heavy responsibilities will only have the empty title of former General. Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, now assumes the highest command of the Sino-Japanese war. His headquarters will be located in Shijiazhuang, with Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin as the commander in Beiping, and General Xu Tingyao as the commander of the Gubeikou battlefield. As for the Beiping Military Affairs Branch, with Zhang's resignation, it will naturally be abolished. Although Zhang's sixteen brigades are nominally his personal troops, Zhang considers them to belong to the Central Government, so he has returned command to the Central Government. Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, allows Zhang the freedom to choose where to live, but Zhang wishes to leave Beiping and will go to Shanghai in the coming days, and later travel to Europe. Zhang is busy with handover procedures today. He Yingqin will take office here tomorrow. It is said that Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, plans to come to Beiping personally if necessary, so that He can go to the front lines to supervise the battle. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Legation in Beiping has been ordered to negotiate with the Chinese authorities for the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the vicinity of Gubeikou. Otherwise, the Japanese army may be forced to advance from Yu Pass and seize the pass from the rear. According to responsible sources, if Japanese persuasion is ineffective, they may ask the British Ambassador Lampson to mediate to prevent the war from extending into North China. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that Japan's desire to avoid the war extending into North China is clear, saying that China is well aware of this and is emboldened by the Japanese army's caution in not pursuing beyond the Great Wall, and is now sending several divisions of troops from the south to North China. These troops are concentrated in Miyun and other places, seemingly intending to recover Rehe. The Japanese army currently seems to only occupy the outer defenses of Gubeikou. Gubeikou has a strategic position, and a frontal attack is very difficult. Therefore, Japan believes that if it cannot persuade China to voluntarily withdraw its troops from there, the Japanese army may have to attack from the rear via North China. Once Gubeikou falls into the hands of the Japanese army, the concentration of Chinese troops in North China is not of much concern. However, as long as the Chinese army defends this crucial pass, a large number of Chinese troops stationed in North China could lead to a dangerous situation. According to the situation, Japan will try to negotiate the establishment of a neutral zone along the Great Wall from Yu Pass, with both sides guaranteeing non-aggression. (Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) News from Tokyo says that Japan will negotiate directly with China, demanding that Chinese troops withdraw from Gubeikou. If negotiations fail, Japan will ask the British Ambassador to mediate, and so on. Today, a Reuters reporter asked the British Embassy about this, and learned that the British Embassy was unaware of the matter. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) As of 5 PM today, the Japanese Chargé d'affaires had not yet received instructions from Tokyo to consult with the Chinese authorities on the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Gubeikou, but this morning, Tokyo cabled that the instructions had been issued. (Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese people in the city all went to the public hall at 5 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. For a time, vehicles and horses filled the streets. The content of the meeting is unknown. At 7 PM, plainclothes detectives of the Japanese Concession also went into full swing. Our side has made considerable preparations. Merchants and residents in the Beima Road, Dongma Road, and Nanshi areas all closed their doors at 8 PM. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong went to Beiping by car on the morning of the 10th to meet Zhang and will also go to the Pinghan Railway to meet Chiang to ask for instructions on everything. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping this morning to discuss important matters. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang, Zhang, and others had a secret talk in a special train in Baoding for two hours yesterday afternoon. Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Huang Shaoxiong, and were all present. All important issues in North China were discussed in detail. After the talk, they had dinner in Chiang's special train. At 10 PM, Chiang and Yang Yongtai left Baoding and returned to Shijiazhuang, planning to stay in Shijiazhuang for a while. Zhang and others also returned to Beiping. Zhang returned to Shunchengwang Mansion to rest at 3:40 AM this morning. He Yingqin, Yang Jie, Huang Shaoxiong, and He Jingwu arrived in Beiping at 9 AM this morning. Xu Yongchang arrived in Shijiazhuang on the 9th, representing Yan to meet Chiang, reporting on the anti-Japanese situation in Shanxi. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the Baoding Conference had a complete plan for military affairs in North China. Chiang is particularly concerned about the defenses along the Great Wall. The Central Government will assist with full force. Zhang convened a meeting of his subordinates at the Shunchengwang Mansion tonight, reporting on the visit to Baoding to meet Chiang. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Ministry of the Navy announced that recently, in addition to the regular warships in Qingdao, the entire Second Foreign Dispatch Fleet has been dispatched to the Yuguan and Qindao area for security, and the Third Fleet has been dispatched to the Yangtze River basin. The entire fleet consists of thirty-eight ships with a total of eight thousand personnel. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, the Japanese have been using large sums of money to buy over hooligans and traitors in various ports along the Great Wall, as well as in Tianjin, Beiping, Tanggu, and other places, to restrain our army's rear when necessary. Japanese soldiers stationed in Tianjin have recently set up defenses at the Haiguang Temple barracks, the Sino-Japanese border area, and the east side of the Tanggu wharf, etc. The situation is very chaotic. The number of Japanese soldiers in Tianjin has been secretly increased, and so far, another two thousand five hundred have been added. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Situation Can Still Be Managed</h3>
<p>Rehe, with its vast area of 580,000 square miles, was lost to enemy forces of only two divisions in ten days. It goes without saying that it was a retreat without a fight, a desertion by someone. Only recently has there been news of Sun Dianying's troops engaging the enemy in fierce fighting in the Weichang area, with attempts to counterattack Chengde and restore Rehe. We are sincerely pleased to hear of the bravery of Sun's troops from afar, but we also expected that a part of the army would be isolated outside the border, with Chifeng and Chengde both belonging to the enemy. How could it last for a long time? In the past, driving hungry troops to battle, there were indeed those who were motivated by loyalty and righteousness for a time, but in the end, they did not help the overall situation of the country. Now, Sun's troops have also been reported to have retreated to Duolun.</p>
<p>Therefore, if our country is willing to retreat in defeat, then so be it. But if it still wants to recover lost territory, it should launch a sudden attack, taking advantage of the fact that the forced troops are still struggling to fight hard and the enemy has not yet established a firm foothold. Rapidly dispatch troops to provide assistance and launch a pincer attack with the troops outside the pass. At this time, the enemy troops defending Chengde consist of only one infantry brigade and one cavalry brigade from the Eighth Division, and those who can provide support are at most the entire Sixth Division and the Fourth Cavalry Brigade. Even if the original old troops of the Northeast Army are used, it would be enough to shatter the enemy. Therefore, today's bold advance without hesitation is the best strategy. Otherwise, detour through Zhangbei, fully supply the troops currently confronting the enemy. On the one hand, strictly control Gubeikou, on the other hand, order the anti-Japanese troops to concentrate in Duolun, and attack at any time, gradually recovering the area. Use our strengths to maximize the effectiveness of infantry sniping. The enemy has no convenient transportation and is in danger of being attacked. If we can hold on for a long time, even if we cannot recover Rehe, we can at least maintain Tianjin and Beiping, stabilize North China, which would still be a good strategy. If we are confused by the enemy's propaganda of bombing threats and the cunning plan to establish a neutral zone along the Great Wall, and do not adopt these two strategies, once Duolun falls into the hands of the enemy, the anti-Japanese troops will repeat the mistakes of Suma, and the situation in Chahar will be dangerous, and North China will fall into even greater danger. This is the worst of all strategies.</p>
<p>In order to complete its militaristic aggression, Japan does not hesitate to openly declare that Japan will expand its military, exposing the mask of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Japan's increase in military equipment can be known from its fiscal military expenditure this year. The reason why it notified the League of Nations is that although Rehe has been obtained, it is not easy to defend. Disrupting Tianjin and Beiping still requires planning. If we examine the situation in Rehe and look at the map, we can see that the Greater Khingan Mountains pass through its northeast, and the Qilaotu Mountains originate from the Greater Khingan Mountains and meander south. The central part of Rehe is the highest point, crossing the Great Wall to form the Luan River valley, which flows directly into the Bohai Sea. Sloping to the east is the [South Manchurian] Plain, and sloping to the west is the Hebei-Shandong alluvial land. According to this topography, if we can control Rehe and advance eastward, it would be very easy to follow the terrain to recover the Northeast. Unfortunately, if Rehe is taken by the enemy, they can control Luandong along the Luan River, looking down from a high position, Hebei will be in danger. Therefore, since the fall of Rehe, the offense and defense have been reversed, and the enemy is already in an advantageous position. Fortunately, Chahar is still in our hands, and [Duolun] can still control the enemy's flank. If our country can make timely efforts to set up defenses along the border and gather heavy troops in Duolun, resolving the past issues between Inner and Outer Mongolia in the shortest possible time, then attacking Rehe from the side and recovering lost territory is not necessarily impossible. In short, losing the Northeast was a mistake in the past, and abandoning Rehe was another mistake later. The court and the public should reflect on this and avoid repeating past mistakes. There is no need to blame those who cannot be blamed. We must immediately rise up to resist Japan, and any sacrifice will be made to stop the enemy's continuous attacks and save the country from danger. The Tianjin and Beiping telegrams received today seem to have decided to resist unanimously. The only hope for the renewal of China lies in this.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Plan to Defend Luanping Firmly</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Gubeikou report: Large numbers of our volunteer troops are attacking the enemy in the Lingyuan to Pingquan area, and the fighting is fierce. Both sides have suffered heavy casualties. It is said that the enemy is very concerned about the rear and will defend Luanping firmly in order to clear the volunteer troops in the rear. However, we have decided to launch a strike with the volunteer troops. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Qingshiliang Shoots Down Japanese Aircraft</h3>

One plane was hit and fled. The remaining two planes fled to the Qingshiliang area to bomb our army's positions. Our army shot down one plane with anti-aircraft artillery. The fuselage crashed into the mountain, and the damage was very heavy. The enemy pilot Hirota was crushed in the head by the plane and died immediately. There were also three other crew members, including Sergeant Sasaki, who were all captured and escorted to the rear. The plane was transported to Gubeikou. More than a hundred anti-aircraft artillery pieces and anti-aircraft machine guns were transported to our front and rear positions, greatly boosting morale. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Retreat to Duolun Due to Lack of Supplies</h3>
<p>Telegram from Tianjin Recounts the Counterattack Process</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Front-line telegram: Sun Dianying's troops began to retreat from Weichang to Duolun on the 9th due to the exhaustion of ammunition and supplies and the inability to replenish them. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zheng Xiaoxu to Be Scorned by the Japanese</h3>
<p>Another Person to Be Selected to Replace Him</p>
<p>(Beiping) A confidant of the traitor Zheng Xiaoxu secretly came to Beiping from Changchun. According to him, they all served under Zheng. Recently, all personnel under Zheng have been dismissed by Zheng and left Changchun, because Zheng has recently lost favor with the Japanese. The Japanese often scold him as a senile old fool because of his old-fashioned thinking. Therefore, Zheng often clashed with the Japanese, but the Japanese have great power, and Zheng must eventually submit. The anti-Zheng faction under Puyi took the opportunity to overthrow Zheng, secretly reporting Zheng's actions to the Japanese. The two sides became increasingly hostile. Zheng felt uneasy in his position, so he first dismissed his subordinates and advised them to return to their hometowns. He will also take the opportunity to retire. The Japanese side plans to choose a pro-Japanese person with new knowledge to succeed Zheng. The Japanese consul in Tianjin is already discussing with someone in that port, inviting him to Changchun. That person has not yet agreed. The Japanese side plans to recall the traitor Ding Shiyuan to temporarily replace Zheng if that person does not agree. Therefore, Zheng is now in Changchun, lamenting the "cooked rabbit" phenomenon. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Lord Lytton on Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Cannot Delay Its Actions Because of This</p>
<p>Diplomatic Contacts Should Be Made to Exert Pressure on Japan</p>
<p>(London) Lord Lytton published an article in the "Observer," stating that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations must not be a reason for the League of Nations to delay its actions. If Japan does withdraw from the League of Nations, diplomatic contacts should be made immediately to uphold the League of Nations Covenant, and such contacts must be supplemented by gradually effective means of pressure, such as prohibiting loans to Japan and providing loans. Ultimately, Manchuria should be given an effective government that does not conflict with the Covenant and is acceptable to the people. However, this matter cannot be realized without Japan's support. Therefore, the pressure on Japan to force it to recognize the League of Nations' arbitration must proceed simultaneously with another solution prepared by the League of Nations.

<h3>Ambassador Yan Huiqing Presents Credentials to Russia</h3>

Afterwards, the two had a private conversation. Yan's speech stated: "I am deeply gratified by the restoration of the old friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and I am especially pleased to be able to work for the relations between the two countries. China and the Soviet Union are not only geographically connected, but also have historical and political relations. We have thousands of miles of border. Your country, based on the principles of equality and mutual assistance, signed the important Beijing Agreement of 1924 with the Chinese government. Your country, during the transition and transformation period, has been able to establish a</p>
<h3>Ambassador Yan Huiqing</h3>
<p>an economic plan with great frugality and dedication, put it into practice, and gained multi-faceted admiration. The success of this plan and its implementation will surely be an inspiration to the Chinese government and people who are also engaged in transformation work. Therefore, I will do my best to promote the traditional friendship and friendly relations between our two countries." Kalinin replied, "The Soviet government has always adhered to the basic spirit of the important declarations of 1919 and 1920 and the Beijing Agreement of 1924 in its relations with China. The Soviet Union's policy has never changed. Even in recent years, when diplomatic relations have been suspended due to other reasons, its friendship and sympathy for China have not changed." Finally, Kalinin expressed his deep satisfaction with the resumption of Sino-Soviet relations, and said that Ambassador Yan would surely gain the trust and support of the Soviet government in fulfilling his mission.

<h3>Guo Taiqi's Remarks</h3>
<p>Japan's Ambitions Toward Us Have Not Ended</p>
<p>Further Strengthen China's Determination to Resist Japan</p>
<p>(London) Guo Taiqi, Chinese representative to the League of Nations and Minister to the United Kingdom, returned here from Geneva yesterday. This afternoon, a reporter from this agency visited him. Minister Guo said: "There is no such thing as direct negotiations between China and Japan, because it is contrary to the policy China holds, and Japan has now occupied Rehe and its ambitions have not ended. Its intention is to conquer all of China and dominate Asia. Therefore, direct negotiations at this time are also useless. Chinese public opinion is extremely angry. Although Rehe has been lost, it will surely be recovered. This is predictable. Although there is no official news to confirm the death of Tang Yulin and the resignation of Zhang Xueliang, from now on, the anti-Japanese military affairs will be personally directed by Chiang Kai-shek, and the people of the whole country will be united to support him. Although Guangzhou and Nanjing had slightly different opinions on politics in the past, they have now abandoned their past grievances and are united against foreign enemies. The only thing they disagree on is the method to be adopted in national defense. Therefore, China is being unified by the pressure of foreign aggression. I am personally deeply disappointed by the defeat of the Chinese army, but although the war is temporarily unfavorable, the morale of the people is still available. From now on, the people's sense of self-defense will be even greater than before. Therefore, the loss of Rehe has further strengthened China's determination to resist to the end. The League of Nations' report is very clear about Japan's actions. However, the Japanese government took advantage of the report to invade Rehe Province after it was passed by the General Assembly, and staged further acts of aggression. In this situation, it is even more necessary than before for the international community to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on Japan. And our people have the right to boycott enemy goods so that they will not be dumped on our markets." As Minister Guo was about to finish his speech, he mentioned that the issue of banning arms exports would be discussed in Geneva, saying, "I sincerely hope for the success of the Disarmament Conference, but I personally believe that this conference has little hope. If Japan does not withdraw from Chinese territory for one day, China will not be able to sign the disarmament treaty for one day. The Tokyo government will also refuse to sign. In this situation, how can the naval reductions demanded by the great powers be achieved? I am afraid that the Disarmament Conference will be shelved from now on." A certain British radio company will invite Guo Taiqi and Yosuke Matsuoka to speak on the Sino-Japanese dispute on Saturday. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>

However, the people of the country must first distinguish between right and wrong, and carefully consider success or failure before acting. Zhang Xueliang's anti-Japanese intentions today, and cooperating with him, is not distinguishing between right and wrong.

<h3>Inspector General of Customs Advocates Revising the Yangtze River Trade Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Previously, the Ministry of Finance received a request from Jia Yanlin, Superintendent of the Zhenhai Customs, to add branch customs in Lujing Port and Jiangyin. After investigation by the Inspector General of Customs, the Yangtze River Trade Regulations were formulated by the Qing Dynasty. Now, the regular customs and tax bureaus have been abolished, and there are no inspection agencies below Zhenjiang. If cargo ships are allowed to unload at will downstream of Zhenjiang, it will be impossible to prevent. The Yangtze River Trade Regulations should be revised to prevent ships from freely entering the river for trade. Patrol boats should be used to patrol the river mouth. Any merchant ship entering the Yangtze River should first apply to the Wusong Customs for a permit. Those sailing from the Yangtze River for export should also apply for approval from the Wusong Customs. It is also planned to build three Type B patrol boats, using Wusong as a base, and distribute them in the Yangtze River for patrol, from the coast to Jiangyin and the north and south mouths of the Yangtze River on Chongming Island. Once the trade regulations are revised and the coastal patrol boats are built, it will be enough to prevent ships from directly entering the Yangtze River and privately loading and unloading goods in the interior. Therefore, there is no need to set up separate customs offices in Jiangyin and Lujing Port. The Ministry of Finance yesterday instructed the Zhenhai Customs to inform them that there is no need to set up separate customs offices. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Conference Opens the Way for Disarmament Deadlock</h3>
<p>MacDonald and Simon Arrive in Paris</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 9th – British Prime Minister MacDonald arrives today. He will meet with French and German representatives, whose views on disarmament are completely contradictory. It will be extremely difficult to find common ground for an agreement. What is most troubling is not only the absence of the US representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, but also the absence of any major German officials. During his journey to Geneva, Prime Minister MacDonald spent thirty-six hours in Paris, which has drawn much criticism from the Germans. Today, when Conference President Henderson opened the debate at the General Affairs Committee of the Assembly, he asked all nations to express goodwill towards this important event.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 9th – British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon departed from London at 11:00 this morning and arrived in Paris at 5:40 this afternoon.

Daladier is scheduled to meet with MacDonald and Simon at the State Council at 10:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>TASS, Geneva, 9th – The Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference today resumed discussion of the British disarmament proposal, which suggests that European countries issue a joint declaration formally renouncing the use of force to resolve all international disputes. The committee has decided on a formula that includes the British proposal. The Soviet representative, Dovgalevsky, seized the opportunity to reiterate Litvinov's views expressed last month on revising the British proposal. Dovgalevsky first expressed his support for the Persian representative's proposal to extend the provisions of the declaration to countries outside Europe. He then stated that the Soviet representative firmly opposes dividing countries into two categories, European and non-European, requiring the former not to use force under any circumstances, while the latter only needs to abide by the letter of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Dovgalevsky said, "Therefore, I fear that this declaration will not only fail to enhance the power of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but will also diminish it. The Soviet representative is unwilling to join or be responsible for the inevitable tragic consequences of dividing countries into two groups. The Soviet view is that this declaration must be universally extended to all non-European countries in order to be harmless to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and achieve full political effect."</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 9th – Rumors here suggest that Britain has requested Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to personally come to Geneva to assist British Prime Minister MacDonald in making a final effort to save the Disarmament Conference from failure.

Authorities claim that the Italian representative to Geneva, Count Aloisi, has been ordered to represent Italy at the Five-Power Talks and will support British Prime Minister MacDonald's effective and constructive proposals to save the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 9th – It is rumored that British Prime Minister MacDonald has come to Geneva with a plan to save the Disarmament Conference. British sources here deny this, saying that the Prime Minister is determined to break the deadlock of the conference. As for agreements on establishing air force armaments, military strength, and German equality, concrete proposals will be formulated after meetings in Paris with French cabinet members and in Geneva with representatives from Germany, Italy, and other countries. The Prime Minister is expected to arrive here on Saturday or Sunday and stay for about a week, confident that this trip will be fruitful.</p>
<h3>Collapse of the German Federal System</h3>
<p>Hitler Seizes Power in Bavaria</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th – Hitler's bloodless victory in Bavaria is seen by responsible authorities here as a sign of the collapse of the German federal system. It is now expected that the central government aims to build a unified Germany, with a parliament in Berlin and a central government exercising supreme national authority. The Bavarian government's acceptance of General Epp as administrative commissioner was a painful decision to avoid bloodshed, as the Nazi stormtroopers were armed with pistols and planned to forcibly occupy government offices if the Bavarian government refused. Currently, all government offices, including the parliament, are guarded by armed detachments of Nazi stormtroopers.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th – Today, the central government appointed General Franz Ritter von Epp, a prominent Nazi Party member, as the administrative commissioner of Bavaria, the last of the federal states to yield. With this, the policy of German unification has been completed. Previously, the Nazi Party leader had held extensive discussions with Bavarian Premier Dr. Held. It is said that Dr. Held initially agreed but then stated that he needed to convene parliament to elect a new premier. Therefore, the central government took decisive measures for the sake of public safety. However, Dr. Held is still protesting. Tonight, Nazi stormtroopers occupied Bavarian government offices, newspaper offices, and radio broadcasting stations. General Epp made a brief speech, announcing his determination to maintain order.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 10th – The governments of Saxony and Baden have both resigned today. Central representative General Keeling has taken over the administration of Saxony and appointed Nazi Party members to manage various government departments.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th – The occupation of the Strasbourg city hall by Nazi stormtroopers has caused unease in France, as it is seen as a violation of the demilitarized zone. The Berlin party authorities claim that when the stormtroopers acted in Kehl and Karlsruhe, they temporarily occupied the barracks opposite Strasbourg, but have now withdrawn. They also deny violating the Treaty of Versailles, as the barracks were not garrisoned.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 10th – The famous Berlin Daily News has been ordered by the authorities to cease publication for three days.</p>

<h3>Congress Passes Roosevelt's Emergency Law</h3>
<p>Major Overhaul of the American Banking System</p>
<p>Only Those with Sufficient Funds Allowed to Operate</p>
<p>President Retains Financial Dictatorial Powers</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 9th – The American banking sector will enter a new era starting tomorrow. Only those with [one hundred percent] solvency will be allowed to operate. Today, the Senate passed an emergency banking bill by a vote of 73 to 7, guaranteeing that banks with solid foundations will have access to sufficient currency for normal business needs. The President has the power to refuse operating licenses to those who cannot prove their solvency. In addition, President Roosevelt is granted dictatorial powers to place the banking system on a stable footing. The bill, after being signed by the President, will take effect at 8:00 tonight. Its contents are as follows:</p>
<h3>New Banking Law</h3>
<p>(1) All presidential orders and Treasury Department regulations issued before today remain in effect. (2) Reinstates the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, along with the power to prevent hoarding and manage the US gold reserves. (3) Authorizes the President to manage banks to the extent necessary to protect depositors' interests, and authorizes the President and the Treasury Department to quickly reorganize banks with illiquid funds to ensure a solid foundation for permanent liquidity. (4) Amends the Federal Reserve Act, allowing it to directly lend to corporations and individuals using US national debt as collateral, and grants the Federal Reserve Banks broad powers to lend to member banks with solid assets that are currently difficult to use as collateral. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve System to issue Federal Reserve Bank notes, using its own US national debt and notes from corporations, individuals, and partners secured by US national debt as collateral for issuing notes, and may also use notes secured by member banks' solid assets as collateral for issuing notes.</p>
<h3>National Support</h3>
<p>After the announcement of this bill, there was unanimous support throughout the country. Prominent figures in the financial world explained the significance of the bill, saying that the President will only allow banks with sufficient financial strength to repay debts to reopen. The rest must reduce their assets and reorganize, ensuring that their assets match their actual value before they are allowed to reopen. It is also heard that the President plans to issue a type of operating license, using his newly acquired powers to issue licenses to banks with sufficient solvency. Without a license issued by the federal government, they may not resume normal business. After the bill was passed and signed, it was heard that the New York Clearing House Association would begin clearing checks in preparation for the opening of banks tomorrow. Senator Glass, an expert on finance and banking, also stated that about 64% of the banks under the Federal Reserve System could open on Friday. Senators, cabinet members, and Treasury Department experts all believe that this bill passed by Congress can implement the President's main proposal, which is to allow the issuance of more currency under a plan that does not increase the nation's unsecured debt in the slightest. The gold reserves of the Federal Reserve Banks above the statutory gold reserve ratio, along with</p>
<h3>How Many Seek to Harm Roosevelt?</h3>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 10th) – The Walter Tang Post Office in New York found a package addressed to the White House. Suspecting it, they opened and inspected it, finding a bomb filled with explosives, clearly intended to harm President Roosevelt. An investigation is underway to find the person who sent the package. On February 22nd, the same post office discovered a similar package addressed to Washington, but fortunately, it was inspected and no disaster occurred.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Miami, 9th) – Giuseppe Zangara, the assassin who attempted to assassinate President Roosevelt, was previously sentenced to eighty years in prison. Now, due to the death of Chicago Mayor Cermak from his injuries, the court has re-sentenced him to death.</p>
<p>Other legal collateral, is sufficient to provide collateral for a large issuance of new currency.</p>
<h3>President's Message</h3>
<p>The President's first message to Congress today was only 500 words long, only describing the banking crisis, and can be described as the shortest message on a major crisis. After introducing the current critical situation, the message explicitly told Congress that in order to ensure the stable opening of banks, the President wants broader administrative powers to protect depositors and asks for authorization to stably open banks. As for other banks, once they have achieved a stable foundation, they will be quickly allowed to resume operations. The President believes that this legislation should not only immediately dispel people's unnecessary concerns about very stable banks, but also allow them to start a new relationship between banks and the people. Congress should be deeply aware of the important responsibilities borne by the President and the senators. In this short period of five days, it is impossible to draft a complete plan to avoid the repetition of past mistakes, but the completion of this initial procedure should not be delayed in the slightest. Furthermore, the President will soon ask Congress to formulate two plans, both of which are urgently needed at present. After the implementation of these plans, we can proceed to consider the national recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Suspension Extended</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 9th – Roosevelt, in announcing the extension of the bank holiday today, stated that the emergency situation still exists and that it is necessary to issue another announcement extending the amended bank holiday in order to achieve the purpose of the original ban on exports and gold hoarding. During this holiday, gold is not allowed to be moved domestically or exported abroad, nor may ownership of uncoined gold and silver markers be transferred. Foreign exchange speculation will be completely stopped. The banking regulations issued by the Treasury Department will now apply to all banking operations. According to recent reports of gold flowing out of the United States, according to the report released by the Federal Reserve today, gold outflow was very large in the days before the suspension. In the week ending March 8, the United States actually shipped out 7 million yuan in gold, and lost no less than 93,271,000 yuan due to marking ownership of foreign accounts. However, this is still a small number compared to what depositors withdrew domestically. According to the Treasury Department report, the total amount of withdrawals in January and February was only a few yuan short of a whole number of 100 million yuan. If the president had not ordered a ban on movement, the number of withdrawals would have been unknown. Even silver coins are included in the ban during this indefinite suspension period.</p>
<h3>Havas, Washington, 10th. Treasury Secretary Woodin issued a</h3>
<p>Statement, saying that the purpose of the policy adopted by the Ministry of Finance is to enable sound banks to resume operations immediately whenever possible. After President Roosevelt issued a proclamation on banks, he summoned leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives to a meeting at the White House. During the meeting, the President declared that the procedure adopted by the government was to restore [national life]. After the meeting, a certain important person declared that President Roosevelt intends to issue 50 million gold yuan bonds for afforestation, so as to provide jobs for 50,000 people. Another bill is scheduled to reduce federal government expenditures by 500 million gold yuan, most of which is related to pensions for former war veterans and salaries for civil servants. Roosevelt can submit the budget to the Senate and House of Representatives today.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 10th - The total of the Federal Reserve Banks for the week ending March 8 shows a decrease of 10.1 million gold yuan in cash deposits, while currency in circulation increased by 81.8 million gold yuan. The amount of spot reserves in the twelve reserve banks has fallen to 45.5 percent. The minimum amount of their statutory reserves is 40 percent.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 10th – National hoarders of cash, fearing official punishment, are now sending large amounts of gold coins to banks. The number of deposits yesterday was very large. One person alone paid in 35,000 yuan. It is found that the circulation of gold coins among the people is usually less than 25 million yuan, but during the week before the President ordered the ban on withdrawals, the public scrambled to withdraw cash, resulting in a report from the Federal Reserve Board for the week ending March 8 that the United States' cash reserves decreased by 101,000,000 yuan and the amount of currency in circulation increased by 818,000,000 yuan. Since President Roosevelt issued a warning, hoarders yesterday handed over about 30 million yuan in gold coins in New York alone, for a total of 65 million yuan handed over nationwide.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Currency</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - The exact amount of U.S. bonds held by U.S. banks is not yet known, but according to private Wall Street estimates, it reached 10,000,000,000 yuan as of March 1. The amount of bank drafts and other notes that can be used as a currency base is currently unknown. It is estimated that the amount currently circulating in the market is 7,250,000,000 yuan. The amount of currency flowing into the United States in February increased by 906,000,000 yuan, reaching a total of 6,546,000,000 yuan. The amount of gold coins in circulation has increased from 47.8837 million yuan to 571.338 million yuan. The number of coins circulating per person nationwide has jumped from 45.06 yuan to 52.23 yuan. This is the highest per capita circulation since the end of October 1920, and the total circulation has reached the highest level on record.</p>
<h3>Japanese Influence</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - To prevent the yen from soaring after the U.S. gold embargo, the Japanese Ministry of Finance today ordered all exchange banks to report the number of yen purchases and sales in accordance with the Law on Preventing the Outflow of Funds. Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose again today, with various securities rising by two to nine pounds sterling. It is heard that buying is very brisk here after U.S. inflation. The Yokohama Stock Exchange suspended operations after the U.S. announced a bank holiday. It reopened today and the market was calm.</p>
<h3>U.S. First Lady Does Not Forget Needlework</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 10th) - The wife of the new President Roosevelt sat in the gallery during the House of Representatives' debate on the bank bill, knitting with knitting needles. When the members of Congress saw her, they all stood up to pay their respects.</p>

<h3>The Strategic Significance of the Japanese Navy's Grand Naval Maneuvers in Japanese Eyes (Continuation 1)</h3>
<p>(By Masanori Ito)</p>
<p>Seven, the so-called [Atlantic Fleet]</p>
<p>What has been said above is only a general observation of the current situation and peacetime strategies. If we intend to discuss future strategic directions and tactical significance, we naturally have to observe from other perspectives. Regarding the research on the first phase of the Hawaii offensive and defensive exercises, we have two clues:</p>
<p>(A) Japan's implementation of its strategy in Shanghai and its countermeasures.</p>
<p>(B) The utilization and promotion of the Atlantic Fleet. In addition, what is most evident in the entire exercise is:</p>
<p>(C) Obtaining a portion of air supremacy.</p>
<p>Let us first observe the former two (A and B):</p>
<p>The stipulation that the Hawaiian Islands are occupied by the enemy is a prerequisite for testing future real island occupation battles and joint operations between the army and navy. The attacking force participating in this hypothetical battle is the Atlantic Fleet, which has always attracted much attention. Its composition is as follows:</p>
<p>U.S. Fleet Reconnaissance Force (commonly known as the Atlantic Fleet) flagship Augusta (10,000 tons! 8-inch guns), four squadrons of aviation squadrons,</p>
<p>A. Cruiser Force</p>
<p>Second Cruiser Squadron 丨 Memphis, Milwaukee, Richmond, Trenton (all 7,000 tons, 6-inch guns), eight reconnaissance aircraft,</p>
<p>Fourth Cruiser Squadron 丨 Chester, Northampton, Pensacola (all 10,000-ton heavy cruisers), twelve reconnaissance aircraft,</p>
<p>Fifth Cruiser Squadron 丨 Chicago, Louisville, Salt Lake City, Houston (all 10,000-ton heavy cruisers), twelve reconnaissance aircraft (flagship Chicago, repair ship Vestal)</p>
<p>B. Destroyer Force</p>
<p>Flagship Raleigh, two aviation squadrons, First, Second, Third, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Squadrons 丨 a total of twenty-six ships (all 1,200 tons or more oceangoing ships), Nineteenth Reserve Squadron 丨 fifteen ships (medium-sized)</p>
<p>C. Aerial Reconnaissance Force</p>
<p>Flagship Wright (9,553 tons丨27 aircraft), air force guidance ship Langley, Saratoga, Langley (carrying eight to ten aircraft each), eighteen fighter planes (belonging to the flagship), nine reconnaissance planes (same as above), twelve search planes (belonging to the Langley), six for supplementary use (in addition, there are thirty-eight aircraft under the control of the guidance ship Swan)</p>
<p>The above is the total strength of the so-called Atlantic Fleet, which consists of seven heavy cruisers (10,000 tons, 8-inch guns), four 7,000-ton light cruisers, twenty-six first-class destroyers, fifteen second-class destroyers, four aircraft carriers and supply ships, and eighty-three aircraft. The heavy cruisers currently under construction will soon be completed and will also be incorporated into this fleet, while the Second Cruiser Squadron will be incorporated into other fleets. The fleet's great power can already be imagined.</p>
<p>Eight, Rehearsal of the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>In this exercise, the two major aircraft carriers, Saratoga and Lexington, replaced the air force unit. In terms of cruisers, the light cruisers were removed, and seven 10,000-ton ships were incorporated into the Fourth and Fifth Cruiser Squadrons. The fleet's speed reached more than thirty knots. In terms of the air force, the elite units of the U.S. Navy were mobilized, such as the aircraft carrier Saratoga (33,000 tons, 33 knots) and the Lexington (same tonnage), each carrying thirty-eight fighter planes, twelve reconnaissance planes, eighteen bombers, and ten other aircraft, totaling seventy-eight aircraft per ship. The two ships carried a total of one hundred and fifty-six aircraft. In addition, each cruiser carried four aircraft, totaling twenty-eight aircraft, plus those carried by the directly subordinate supply ships, totaling no less than two hundred and fifty aircraft. This is such a powerful large gathering of aviation squadrons. How about the strength of the enemy forces occupying Hawaii to deal with this counterattack? (A) The air force units of the army and navy, (B) submarines, (C) joint army and navy forces. The force included 111 naval aircraft, 120 army aircraft, one army division, some marines, and the Fourth Squadron of the U.S. submarine force, namely S-class submarines (around 1,000 tons), nineteen ships, and four ships over 2,000 tons (these four ships are oceangoing submarines). Whether by chance or on purpose, the scale of the Hawaii offensive and defensive battle is strikingly similar to the Sino-Japanese war in Shanghai. For example, in (A) using cruisers as the main force, (B) making the marines active, (C) using aircraft to attack fortresses and bombing land and water facilities, etc., (D) having the marines cooperate with the army in combat, are all lifelike depictions of the Shanghai Incident.</p>
<p>Therefore, this exercise can be called a high-level Shanghai Incident in terms of forces and equipment.</p>
<p>Nine, Aerial Tactics</p>
<p>In this plan, what is most noteworthy is that its attacking force is actually the world's unparalleled high-speed air strike force. The following is a summary of its current situation:</p>
<p>Tonnage Cannon Power丨丨Number of Aircraft Speed</p>
<p>Cruiser Squadron 70,000 8-inch guns丨652833</p>
<p>Aviation Battleship 66,000 8-inch guns丨1613633</p>
<p>Torpedo Squadron 15,000 18-inch torpedoes 14435</p>
<p>The fleet's speed reaches thirty-two knots, plus the power of more than 180 air force aircraft. Such a unique naval warfare tactic of quickly attacking enemy countries in wartime can't be said to be an unparalleled ideal organization. With two major aircraft carriers as the center, flanked by seven 10,000-ton cruisers, and protected by twelve destroyers in front and behind, crossing rough seas and dangerous waves, the fleet marches on the Pacific Ocean with magnificence. In essence, such a powerful [high-speed fleet] is unheard of in any other country. Therefore, the tactics of the U.S. naval exercises are unique to the United States.</p>
<p>The high-speed army (Speedy Army) and chemical warfare units are the two major characteristics of the U.S. Army. Now the Navy is also actively trying to realize these two characteristics, and if they want to increase the fleet's combat power, the only way is to improve the fleet's speed at sea and seek rapid attacks. Therefore, the U.S. Navy has decided to use aircraft for attacks, so naval strategy also contains the meaning of air strategy.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Hawaiian attack force's organization is to launch a counterattack when a certain territory or dependency is occupied by the enemy, without waiting for the enemy to complete their defensive arrangements, or to capture a certain target in the shortest possible time after the declaration of war.</p>
<p>Under this strategy, if the enemy forces in Hawaii, whose defensive preparations have not yet been completed, are subjected to the counterattacking forces' bombing and shelling, they will surrender after a major air battle. (February 5) When the U.S. flag is re-hoisted in Hawaii, the enemy fleet will begin its offensive towards the Pacific Ocean. (February 6)</p>
<p>Ten, Submarines</p>
<p>During this battle, the spectacle and power of the thirty-six bombers of the attacking force flying in the air over Oahu Island during the attack was many times stronger than that of our (Japanese) air force bombing the Wusong Fort. When the Hawaiian defense forces were attacking the enemy with dozens of fighter planes in the air, the attacking force launched seventy-six fighter planes in a counterattack. At this time, the lightly armed reconnaissance planes also joined in. There were no less than two hundred aircraft flying in the sky like leaves. The spectacle must have been beyond imagination. However, what effect did submarines have on defense at this time? Hawaii had twenty-five submarines. The big target of these ships' attack was the two major aircraft carriers, Saratoga and Lexington. The defense force relied on submarines to launch torpedoes and attack the enemy's aircraft carriers. If one of the two ships could be sunk, the enemy's air control power would be halved, which would not only comfort the residents' fear of air raids, but also greatly aid the main artillery battle in modern naval warfare. Whether the Hawaiian submarine fleet can achieve the above expectations, we can only wait for the battle reports of future exercises. In addition, one thing that is extremely noteworthy is that there are no submarines in the attacking force, and there are no submarines in the organization of the U.S. Navy's main fleet.</p>
<p>Looking at the attacking force in this Hawaii battle, they attach great importance to the aircraft carrier group (Carrier Group), but they don't have a single submarine. This is an indication that submarines are not used in offensive warfare. In other words, submarines are only used for coastal defense and not for offensive attacks. The difference between Japan and the United States (and Britain) in the evaluation of submarines can be seen from this.</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is the reason why the attacking force does not use submarines, which is instead convenient for main force operations. There are two meanings to this reason: one is that torpedoes can be launched from the air, and the other is that the enemy's submarines can be bombed from the air. The U.S. Navy's use of the air force is the best in the world, and their technology for bombing enemy submarines discovered in the air cannot be ranked second in the world. The reason why the U.S. attacking force does not use submarines is that if they also have submarines, it would be difficult for the air force to distinguish between enemy and friendly submarines during reconnaissance, causing the greatest difficulty in tactics. Therefore, if a submarine is discovered in the air, it must be the enemy and can be safely bombed.</p>
<p>This is one of the things that naval countries that value submarines in peacetime pay the most attention to. At the same time, the reason why the attacking force did not use submarines in this exercise can also be understood from this.</p>
<p>Eleven, Attack on the West Coast</p>
<p>In the second phase of the exercise, the reconnaissance force that recaptured Hawaii, consisting of heavy cruisers and aircraft carriers, immediately turned its bow and began an invasion of the U.S. mainland after the Hawaii battle. Defending the U.S. mainland was the Pacific Fleet, the main battleship fleet, consisting of fourteen battleships, four cruisers, thirty-five destroyers, and several aviation squadrons. During the period from February 6 to February 17, the purpose of this exercise announced by the U.S. authorities was to [maximize the test of the U.S. West Coast's defense capabilities] in response to the rapid attack of the rapid attack force and to defend the national coast. From this point of view, this second phase of the exercise, the occupation of the base exercise, is the most important of the three exercises. Using the main battle force as the defending force is not only an indication of taking a defensive exercise, but also somewhat intended to test and promote the large cruisers participating in this attacking force, and the testing and promotion of aviation power is also its secondary purpose.</p>
<p>The first thing that unfolds in this exercise is the naval battle between the attacking and defending forces. The second is that the attacking force invades any one of the three places: San Francisco, San Diego, and San Pedro. In this place, joint army and navy battles, air battles, etc., are re-enacted. The bombers of the Saratoga and Lexington bombed the U.S. West Coast's military equipment, fortresses, bases, factories, etc. The defending fighter planes engaged in interception. On the one hand, the army and navy exchanged artillery fire. At this time, the incompleteness of land equipment and the uneven strength of the water fleet are naturally clear to the people.</p>
<p>Twelve, Joint Training and Chemical Warfare</p>
<p>The third phase of the exercise is a full-scale exercise of the U.S. fleet, including (1) joint tactical exercises, (2) artillery fire, and (3) torpedo firing training, held from March 5th to approximately twenty days, and (4) combat skills demonstration on March 31st. During this period, new types of shooting such as [colored water columns] and [remote illumination] were also demonstrated. Colored water columns are the water columns raised when the main gun shells of each ship fall into the water near the enemy ship. Because of the different ships, they are dyed various colors. For example, the USS Colorado is red and the USS Maryland is yellow. Each ship has its own distinguishing color, so that the aircraft can measure the distance between the falling shells and the enemy ship from the air and report it to the firing ship to seek accurate aiming. Firing one or two shots at an enemy more than 30,000 yards away will not hit the target. First, observe the first shot falling dozens of yards in front of the enemy, then aim the second shot and fire it, watching it fall dozens of yards behind the enemy, and then aim the third shot and fire it into the bullseye. Therefore, the shells falling into the water at the same time from each ship can be measured for distance due to the different ships, which is of course thanks to the [colored water column].</p>
<p>Although illumination shells are nothing strange, when fired from a battleship's giant guns and explode fifteen miles above the enemy ship, they can suddenly illuminate the surroundings of a diameter of 500 yards, and then attack it with artillery. This kind of demonstration is deeply meaningful. The U.S. Navy's efforts in the development of chemical warfare are also worthy of surprise.</p>
<p>Torpedoes are very important in the Japanese Navy, but the opposite is true in the United States. The center of combat skills in joint training is mainly the aviation squadron. If torpedoes are launched from warships, they suffer from direction errors and speed errors, making them difficult to be accurate. Moreover, at a distance of 30,000 yards, the hit rate and effect must be reduced. Therefore, some people advocate that in the future, they should be launched from aircraft, that is, when the enemy's fighter planes cannot descend and within the distance where the enemy ship fires the least number of times, torpedoes can be launched from the aircraft. The effect is of course greater than being launched from a warship. Finally, write two important conclusions. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships and Japanese Residents Stationed in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Ship Bows Point Directly at Wuhu</p>
<p>Residents Gather at the Consulate</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the Japanese Consul in Wuhu, Shirasaki Hakubo, requested protection for Japanese residents from Gao Tiejun, the administrative commissioner of the Second District and concurrently the county magistrate of Wuhu, the Japanese warships stationed in Wuhu suddenly increased. As of yesterday (the 8th), there were already three ships, Taohaji, Yanagi, and Flying Eagle, stationed on the river surface near the Osaka pier and Taikoo wharf. It is said that there are two more ships parked in the Crab Creek area downstream. The bows of all the ships point directly at Wuhu, and Japanese soldiers and residents are constantly active everywhere, causing the people of Wuhu to have a strange feeling.

<h3>Fuzhou's Movement to Resist Inferior Goods and Buy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Organizing Donation Teams to Raise Funds to Purchase Aircraft</p>
<p>Prohibiting the Enemy from Smuggling Raw Materials to Taiwan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The people of Minyuan had previously initiated the organization of the Minhou Aviation Patriotic Association and elected Sa Zhenbing as the chairman. They originally planned to issue lottery tickets to use the profits earned to purchase aircraft. Later, because the provincial government considered lottery tickets to be a form of gambling, it was not allowed to issue them. Yesterday, the association decided to organize forty-six donation teams to set out to solicit donations separately. The method is to have the thirty-four fire brigades in the city organize thirty-four teams, and the twelve autonomous regions organize twelve teams. The association will send people to assist in the process. At the same time, all members of the association will also organize special teams to solicit donations from party, government, and military agencies in order to realize the purchase of aircraft to save the country as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Provincial Capital People's Patriotic Association has recently suspended its work due to lack of funds, causing unscrupulous merchants to become active again and inferior goods to flood the market, especially the silk, Suzhou and Guangdong goods, hardware, seafood, coal, white sugar, and Western medicine industries. Every time Japanese ships imported from Taiwan and Dalian are fully loaded with goods and carry timber and white rice away. This is hateful to destroy the economy, sever diplomatic relations, and provide raw materials to the enemy. Yesterday, a meeting of all personnel was convened to decide to conduct a general inspection in the coming days. If inferior goods are found again in stores that have previously registered with the Patriotic Association and been cleaned up, they will be confiscated and sold at auction, used as funds for the volunteer army, or used to purchase aircraft. It was also decided to severely punish those who smuggle timber and white rice to Dalian and Taiwan. (March 7)</p>
<h3>Guangxi Province Actively Expands Aviation</h3>
<p>Building a Huge Airfield</p>
<p>Adding Six Fighter Planes</p>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence: Guangxi Province has recently been quite active in developing its aviation industry, carrying out pilot training and increasing the purchase of aircraft separately. The Aviation Office is currently located in Liushi, and the airfield is extremely vast. The hangars are located in underground cellars to protect the storage of aircraft. The area around the hangars is covered with defensive works, and the layout is extremely strict. The entire airfield project is still under construction and is divided into three phases, each phase lasting four months. The entire project will be completed in about one year. The first phase of the project requires 600 workers, so the scale is very large. In terms of training personnel, training classes were initially organized to train individual flight personnel. The first phase recruited 60 students, divided into three teams, with a total of eleven pilots and mechanics in each team. One instructor is responsible for training one team. It has been operating for six months, and 22 students are now familiar with solo flight. The skills of the mechanics have also been quite successful. The instructors are all hired from Guangdong. The current instructors include Zheng Zixiang, Guo Liangbi, and Situ Kai. Bishop Situ Kai died in a flight accident last month, and pilot Chen Youshou from Guangdong was hired to fill the vacancy. Last year, Ning Mingjie, Wu Zihong, Li Yifei and others were re-hired as instructors. The first phase of the training class, with 22 pilots, will soon graduate. They are already familiar with solo flight and squadron flight, so the Aviation Office is now holding the second phase of the training class and increasing the training in attack, pursuit, bombing, and reconnaissance techniques. Guangxi Province currently has 20 fighter planes and several training planes in storage. For the sake of expansion, a large number of aircraft supplies and six fighter planes have been purchased from the Far East Aviation Company in Hong Kong and have been shipped to Hong Kong. Zheng Zixiang, representative of the Guangxi Aviation Office, was sent to Hong Kong to inspect the planes. Ning Mingjie, Wu Zihong, and Li Yifei were sent to Wuzhou to wait for the delivery. Zheng visited Li Zongren in Guangdong at the end of last month and reported everything. On the 2nd of this month, he went to the Far East Company in Hong Kong to carry out the inspection. It is planned to ship four fighter planes back to Wuzhou on the 6th. Four foreign pilots from the Far East Company will take off from the Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon and fly to Wuzhou. The remaining two planes are scheduled to be driven back to Guangxi by Zheng himself and the pilots on the 8th. As for the aircraft supplies, they will be transported back to Wuzhou by water and then transported to Liu by land. (March 5)</p>

Their notice letter states: "Respected Sirs, since the establishment of our association, we have proposed the construction of a clubhouse and organized a fundraising team, originally aiming for 40,000 yuan. However, due to the impact of floods and the invasion of the violent Japanese, the national crisis is imminent, and it is not easy to raise funds. It has been postponed repeatedly. As of the end of February this year, we have received donations of 9,893 yuan, plus 465 yuan under the old management, totaling 10,358 yuan. After deducting 4,073 yuan for the purchase of the base and road construction fees, there is actually a balance of 6,285 yuan. There are also about 3,000 yuan that have been pledged but not yet paid, and more than ten teams that have not yet reported. We are now building the rear five upper and five lower, including the lower rooms, etc., which will cost about 8,500 yuan. We have already paid 5,500 yuan. It is expected to be completed by the end of May. Once completed, we will hold a general meeting of all members at the new clubhouse at a fixed time.

<h3>Heavy Bushel Crisis Resolved</h3>

<p>Flat Bushel Funnel Decided After Inspection</p>
<p>Temporary Strike Joint Association Ends</p>
<p>The Da Gong News reported that the ship merchant heavy bushel strike crisis was resolved yesterday after the second inspection by party and government agencies at Rengu Hall. It was decided to adopt the flat bushel funnel. Before all ship merchants have prepared funnels, a transitional period of one month is tentatively set. The bushel division will still use flat bushels. Ship merchants of all factions will resume shipping unanimously today. The strike joint association will be closed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspection Decision</h3>
<p>Yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs held the second inspection of Jingqi at Rengu Hall on Zhonghua Road. Over sixty representatives from various rice industry organizations and ship merchants attended (representatives from rice shops were absent). The Inspection Office inspected the leaky bushel, zuba, and two-ba bucket three times in succession. The statistics showed that the quantity measured by the flat bushel funnel was accurate, so it was decided to adopt it.</p>
<h3>Joint Notice</h3>
<p>Party and government agencies jointly notified the North and South City Ship Merchant Lianyi Association to inform the ship merchants to resume shipping immediately. The original text stated: "This is a notice regarding the dispute over bushels of rice. The party and government agencies have now determined the standards and implementation methods. Before these standards and methods are implemented, a transitional period of one month is tentatively set. The bushel division will still use flat bushels. In addition to the party and government agencies sending personnel to the North and South Rice Markets at any time to supervise the bushels, the association should inform the rice boats to resume shipping immediately. If disputes arise during the busheling of rice, direct conflict and disturbances are not allowed. This is extremely important. This is especially notified.

<h3>Song Ziwen Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Arriving by Ford Plane</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, went north on official business a few days ago. Now that the matter is completed, he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning by Ford plane from Beiping. He arrived safely at Hongqiao Airport at around 2:00 PM and immediately returned to his residence on Yulin Road by car.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ziqiao is Now in Beiping</h3>
<p>The Volunteer Army Continues to Fight Bitterly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association and the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Zhu Ziqiao in Beiping yesterday, stating: (omitted) "I received the telegram from the two gentlemen of the Shen group this year. I am grateful for the concern of the gentlemen for the situation of the Volunteer Army and Qinglan, as reported in the Shanghai and other newspapers. I specially asked the two gentlemen to come north to express their condolences. I am extremely grateful. The fall of Rehe this time was caused by complex reasons, which is deeply regrettable. However, the Volunteer Army has been fighting bitterly and has not fired a shot. Those who have been in the battlefield can testify to this. Qinglan is still in Ping dealing with resistance and support affairs. Please release your concern and express your gratitude. Zhu Qinglan Geng (8th day)."</p>
<h3>Tang Juwu's Urgent Telegram</h3>
<p>Resolved to Fight to the End While There is Still Breath</p>
<p>Soldiers Curl Up in the Trenches, Chewing Snow</p>
<p>Telegram Urges the Volunteer Army Support Association to Provide Assistance Quickly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received an urgent telegram from Tang Juwu, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army, yesterday, stating: "Since Juwu arrived in Ping, he has received assistance from all parties. After a slight replenishment, he immediately marched towards Liaodong. As soon as the troops arrived in Chosun, they suddenly encountered an invasion by 4,000 Japanese soldiers Suzuki, and puppet Wang Jiaju, etc. At that time, Dong brigade was guarding Chaoyang. Due to lack of supplies, they were attacked by the enemy on both sides. Seeing that they could not hold on, Juwu, upon hearing the news, rushed to reinforce them. He circled around to the rear of the enemy and attacked them fiercely. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. We also suffered several casualties among officers and soldiers. Then, the Japanese army drove up seven tanks and charged horizontally at our position. Five aircraft dropped bombs in the air for cover, coupled with heavy artillery attacks. We fought another bloody battle for four hours and shot down one of their aircraft with anti-aircraft guns before temporarily retreating. It is found that the failure of Rehe this time was mostly due to lack of supplies. National telegrams are still like this. The volunteer army is even more unbearable to ask. The soldiers curled up in the trenches, and some had not eaten for a day or two. Unable to bear the hunger, they chewed snow. Although they were so distressed and difficult, their courage was extremely strong. As long as Juwu still has a breath, he is determined to fight to the end. The corresponding telegram is heard, and it is hoped that frequent assistance will be given so that the thieves can be killed, immeasurably grateful. This please Gongqi. Tang Juwu Kowei."</p>
<h3>Feng Zhanhai's Representative Talks About the Course of Rehe's Fall</h3>
<p>Zhao Zhuohua and Guan Jun, representatives of Feng Zhanhai, whose Ninth Army of the Northeast Volunteer Army was recently reorganized into the 63rd Army of the Army, have been reporting to various parties on the course of Rehe's fall since arriving in Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met them at their hotel yesterday. The following is a record of their talk on the course of Rehe's fall:</p>
<p>Rear is Empty</p>
<p>From Chengde to Fuxin and Kailu, there are 1,200 li. Kailu was originally garrisoned by Cui Xinwu's Brigade of the Tang Department, and Chaoyang was garrisoned by Dong Futing's Brigade of the Tang Department. Fuxin, which is between Kai and Zhao, was garrisoned by the enemy army (Feng Zhanhai's Department). Since the puppet Allied Army attacked us, our rear was a distant 1,200 li, with no defense forces, no military stations, no supplies, and no rations. All guns and bullets were supplied by Chengde, and all food and drink had to be sought out on our own. How inconvenient it was!</p>
<p>Tang's Younger Brother's Revolt</p>
<p>Tang Yulin's younger brother wanted to obtain a certain-level military officer position in Dong's brigade, which incited the anger of the regiment of the brigade, so they rebelled and defected. Once Chaoyang was lost, the entire situation was shaken. Our army could have retreated from Fuxin to Jianping, but the rebel troops led the rebel army to occupy Jianping. Our army then concentrated on Chifeng, and then concentrated on Chifeng from Xiawazi and Daxintala. At that time, Sun Dianying's army also reinforced Chifeng from the hunting ground. Unfortunately, misunderstandings arose again, which is extremely regrettable. Now our army is at , Sun's army is at , Su Bingwen's department is heading south from , and has established contact, forming a angle-like situation, but this 1200 li</p>

<h3>Aviation Association Informs the Nation That Consolidating Air Defense Is the Beginning of Relieving National Crisis</h3>
<p>If We Abandon Ourselves, the Calamity of Chengde Will Spread Throughout the Country</p>
<p>The Nation Relies on Air Defense; the Lessons from the Three Northeastern Provinces and Rehe Are Not Far Off</p>
<p>The Public Should Spontaneously Organize; Every Drop of Contributions Should Be Used</p>
<p>Since the fall of Chengde, some people have expressed despair over national affairs due to indignation, and some have suspected that the movement to save the country through aviation is too slow to remedy the current difficulties. The China Aviation Association specially issued a declaration this morning, stating the importance of air defense, and urging the people of the country to take the fall of Rehe as a warning and work harder. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Letter from the Aviation Association to the People of the Country: Since the establishment of this association, all parties have placed high expectations on it, and the whole country has given assistance. Although the recruitment of members lasted no more than ten days, the results have been remarkable. We are deeply gratified. However, with the fall of Chengde and the danger to North China, a few passionate people, gambling that one or two cowardly divisions and fleeing generals would lightly abandon the country and shame the international community, have tended to fall into the abyss of despair, thinking that national affairs are like this, and they should live in solitude to the end. Alas, filling ourselves with a self-abandoning mentality is enough to erode the nation's vitality, and is it the wish of our patriotic people to be ruined from now on? But how did Rehe fall? It is right to say that it was due to the cowardice of the commander, the lack of preparation, the inconvenience of transportation, and the obstruction of communication. However, if we think calmly, we will know that the enemy's military strength is far superior to ours. We only rely on ancient organizational methods, while the enemy is rich in modern weapons. We only rely on the bravery of the army, while the enemy uses the power of the air force to control the fate of our army. Leaving aside other things, the enemy planes speeding across towering mountains and ridges, scouting our military situation, destroying our positions, slaughtering our compatriots, and demoralizing us, isn't the enemy's rampant destruction enough to make our loyal and brave soldiers toil in vain and end up drinking their hatred? Alas, if our people witness the fall of Chengde and become despondent from now on, no longer eagerly donating to support our aviation national defense, then the calamity of Chengde will follow and spread throughout the country. Thinking of this, how can we not tremble with fear? It is not just a matter of dealing with the temporary national crisis. We are born in this world, and since we cannot be without a country, the country cannot be without defense. And air defense is the latest and most effective weapon of national defense and the most effective means of self-defense. We cannot be without a country for a single day, so we cannot be without air defense for a single day. The lack of organization in air defense in the past has already caused us to lose three provinces and fall into Rehe. If we are still a nation without air resistance today, can our people's lives and our country's vitality be permanently secured from now on? This is a serious question that we hope our compatriots across the country will deeply consider. This association was organized in response to the painful events in Shanghai, and now the recruitment of members coincides with the fall of the Northeast and the fall of Chengde. Thinking of the national crisis, we feel even more inspired. Now that the whole country is filled with grief and indignation, and the army is full of soldiers who can fight, if we can unite as one and save the country through aviation, with everyone joining this association as members, then the day when the foundation of aviation national defense is consolidated will also be the day when the unprecedented national crisis is relieved. Time waits for no one; let us rise up together. Finally, this association has something more to say: This association is a spontaneous organization of the people. Although the government appreciates its aspirations and has appointed directors and supervisors, the association's affairs are conducted independently, and the membership fees collected are issued by the association. After collection, the association's management committee is responsible for the safekeeping, and the management committee is composed of the association's directors and celebrities from all walks of life. In the future, how the association will use the funds, how it will develop its business, and how it will contribute to the government will all be decided by the association based on public opinion. The government has no intention of interfering, and the benefits of every drop of contribution going to the public are beyond doubt. People from all walks of life are requested to take note.</p>
<p>The Director of the Bureau of Public Works Receives the Architectural Community: Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works in this city, was invited by Wu Tiecheng, the leader of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association, to serve as the captain of Team 270. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, he held a tea party at the YMCA for people in the architectural community in this city. The attendees included Fan Wenzhao, Zhao Shen, Li Hongru, Qi Minghe, Tang Wenti, Gu Daosheng, Zheng Hanxi, Yao Changan, Geng Guangzong, Li Keng, Du Ruiji, Li Pan, Lu Qianshou, Lian Jun, Xu Zhitian, Li Zufan, Zhu Shuyi, Jin Tongyin, Wu Zhenying, Su Xiaxuan, Huang Yuanji, Yang Runyu, Huang Ziqiang, Miao Kaibo, Zhou Lexi, Guan Songsheng, and others, totaling twenty-six people. Director Shen delivered a speech on the important significance of saving the country through aviation, and decided to form sub-teams for the convenience of recruitment. As a result, all attendees enthusiastically participated and took on the roles of sub-team leaders to carry out recruitment. The architects who were unable to attend due to other commitments also inquired about the methods by telephone afterwards and expressed their willingness to provide support, which is sufficient to prove the enthusiasm of the community for the aviation national salvation movement.</p>
<p>The Local Court Has Deducted Donations from Salaries: The Central Political Conference resolved to donate funds for saving-the-nation airplanes and ordered all courts and departments to comply accordingly. The Shanghai Local Court has now received an order from the Jiangsu Higher Court, which was forwarded by the Ministry, that all officials, clerks, police officers, and servants should have their salaries deducted according to the standard and remitted. It is reported that the minimum donation must be more than two months' salary. The President, the Chief Prosecutor, and others have already issued orders to all subordinates to comply.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Speaks on the Economic Situation in Europe and America</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Management Association Held a Luncheon Banquet Yesterday</p>
<p>The World's Industry Is Worthy of Our Reference</p>
<p>The Causes of the Economic Panic Are Extravagance and Speculation</p>
<p>Our Country Should Control the Economy, Harmonize Labor and Management, and Revitalize Agriculture</p>
<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held a luncheon discussion meeting at the Lianhua General Assembly on Beijing Road at 12:00 noon yesterday, and at the same time, it held a banquet for Mr. Kong Xiangxi, who had just returned from abroad after inspecting industries. Mr. Kong is the chairman of the association, so the association also invited him to speak on his experience and feelings from this industrial inspection, so that the industrial and commercial circles of this port can understand the industrial situation abroad and learn from it. The attendees included Pan Xulun, Pan Yangyao, Chen Jicheng, He Dekui, Zhang Zilian, Chen Liting, Wu YunChu, Li Zhaohuan, Cao Xuexiang, Xu Yongzuo, Li Zufan, Mu Jiechu, Liu Hongsheng, Zhao Jinqing, Fang Yixian, and former Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, totaling more than 40 people. Mr. Kong gave a speech on his feelings about this overseas industrial inspection and his opinions on the future development of industry in China. After the speech, He Dekui, Li Gongpu, and others asked questions one after another, and Mr. Kong answered them one by one. The meeting ended at 2:00 p.m. The following is a record of Mr. Kong's speech and answers:</p>
<p>Eliminating Evils and Preserving Benefits: Mr. Kong stood up and gave a speech, first briefly describing the international relations and status of our country today, and taking concerted efforts as the key. Then, he spoke about his observations and feelings from this inspection. He said, "I went abroad to inspect industries at a time when the world was experiencing an economic panic and industrial decline. When I arrived in the United States, someone said to me, 'Your trip is not well-timed. I am afraid you will not be able to see the prosperity of this industry.' My intention is exactly the opposite. If we only see the economic prosperity of advanced countries, we will take the system of prosperous countries as our teacher without knowing its drawbacks. Now that it is tending towards decline, it is enough for us to learn from it, so that the construction of our country can preserve its benefits and eliminate its evils, just as a doctor can prescribe a treatment after seeing the symptoms."</p>
<p>Serious Unemployment: The total population of the United States is 120 million, and the number of regularly unemployed people is more than 14 million. If the wives and children of the unemployed are included, there are at least 40 million, accounting for one-third of the country's population. The seriousness of the problem can be seen. Thousands of banks have collapsed in a year, and the social and economic panic has reached its extreme. When I was in New York, someone led me to see the vault of a bank and said, "These are all banknotes." Because depositors feared that banks would collapse, they withdrew their deposits and stored them in vaults, causing social finance to stagnate and fall into panic every day.</p>
<p>Excessive Enjoyment: The situation of unemployment and panic in European countries such as Germany and England is similar. The reasons are nothing more than two: First, excessive consumption during peacetime. Before the panic occurred, workers' lives were relatively stable. They paid attention to enjoyment. Coupled with the relationship of mass production and the method of promotion, they tried to benefit customers. By paying ten yuan first, you can get a car, and five yuan can buy a piano. The rest is gradually paid from the weekly wages. Once unemployed, there is no fixed income, so of course they cannot afford to pay. The items used in the past are all recovered, even the beds and chairs needed for daily use are donated to pay off debts. Tens of thousands of people are wandering the streets all day long without a home to return to in New York City alone. Mass Speculation: The second reason is speculation. Larger companies sell their stocks on the market, and many investors engage in this type of trading, using the rise and fall of prices to seek profits. The rise and fall of stocks depend entirely on the supply and demand of the market, and no one asks about the prosperity or decline of the company. Moreover, due to overproduction, production is suspended, and stock prices plummet. Some stocks are worth 500 yuan, but the selling price is less than 5 yuan. Bankruptcies follow one another, and everyone is implicated, so the social economy becomes more and more panic. The situation in France is slightly different. Because it does not have large industries, but produces small industries, there is no such panic. Italians often say that we are not as rich as the United States, so we have not suffered the crisis of the United States.</p>
<p>Tariff Barriers: Today, the most problematic issue in European and American countries is war debts. European countries owe a lot of debts during the war, and in recent years, all countries have fallen into economic panic. They do not have huge amounts of money to pay off their debts, and can only pay them off with goods. However, the goods produced by the United States themselves cannot be sold well, so why do they need goods from other countries to offset them? Therefore, tariff barriers are becoming higher and higher, causing international trade to shrink day by day, and the flow of finance is also becoming narrower, and the world economic panic is becoming more and more critical. However, the United States cannot abandon war debts, because they were raised from the people at the time of fundraising, and now the people are in poverty and panic, so how dare the government decisively exempt them to increase the burden on the people?</p>
<p>Five Opinions: The results of my trip to the world have provided many lessons for the future development of industry in our country, which should be followed by us. In short, there are about five points: 1. The government and important industrial and commercial groups should have considerable economic control over the national industry. 2. Strive to make the production volume and consumption volume compatible. 3. Prevent excessive expansion of speculative undertakings. 4. Strive for the coordination of labor and management. 5. Promote and revitalize agriculture, so that our country's collapsed economy can have hope of recovery, and lay a solid foundation for the development of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The Situation in France: After Mr. Kong's speech, He Dekui asked about the economic situation in France. Mr. Kong replied that it was relatively good. People always regard Paris as representing France, which is a big mistake, because Paris is an international playground, and all its facilities are designed to attract tourists from other countries, not the true colors of France. The French are very diligent and good at saving, so the domestic economy is relatively stable. Then someone asked about Britain's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute. Mr. Kong replied that the British do not want to be a third-party sacrifice and try to avoid getting involved in the vortex.</p>
<p>Social Revolution: Finally, Li Gongpu asked whether the economic panic in the United States, Germany, and Britain is becoming more and more serious. In contrast to the economic construction in the Soviet Union, is it about to erupt into a social revolution? Mr. Kong replied that the British economy has begun to show an upward trend. Germany must depend on whether Hitler can change his attitude after taking office. He is afraid that too much high pressure will cause repercussions. The situation in the United States is the most complicated and difficult to predict. However, Americans are full of self-confidence and responsibility, and may be able to work hard to overcome this difficulty.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Write to the Chamber of Commerce to Pay Attention to Inferior Goods Being Passed Off as National Goods</h3>
<p>Examine the Production and Sales Volume at Any Time</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens Association jointly wrote to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, asking them to pay attention to inferior goods being passed off as national goods. The original letter stated, "Dear Sirs, according to the discussion at the general meeting of our association members [on how to determine the method of saving the country and earnestly carry it out], the majority of the members present proposed that recently, some national goods manufacturers have been using the certificates of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and national goods organizations to secretly pass off inferior goods and replace trademarks to pass off as national goods, especially dyeing and printing factories and cotton yarn merchants. Therefore, it was resolved [to send letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and national goods organizations to strictly pay attention to whether the production quantity and sales quantity of national goods manufacturers are consistent, and to examine them at any time], etc. This matter is related to the fundamental salvation of the country and should be approved by you. We are sending a copy of the case to you and hope that you will take it into consideration."</p>
<h3>Germany Will Change Its National Flag</h3>
<p>German僑在本市 Inclined to the Old National Flag</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that whether Germany will still use the black, red, and gold tricolor flag as the national flag, or change to the old black, white, and red tricolor flag, is a problem that Germany will solve. The German expatriates in this port are calmly dealing with it. According to German dispatches, the National Socialist Party has taken down the black, red, and gold tricolor republican flag and replaced it with the old black, white, and red tricolor flag, with the National Socialist Party's swastika party emblem in the middle. However, Shanghai has not yet changed it. When asked about this matter at the German Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday, the reply was that the black, red, and gold tricolor flag is stipulated in the constitution of the Republican Germany. If the new parliament resolves to amend the article in the constitution regarding the national flag, or the president issues a special order to change the national flag, then Shanghai will immediately change it. As for the feelings of the German expatriates in this port regarding the change to the old flag, a respected person told the representative of the "North China Daily News" yesterday that the German expatriates in this port have always regretted that the black, white, and red national flag was changed to the black, red, and gold tricolor flag. However, as law-abiding citizens, they had to comply. He also said that the Germans feel that being under the black, white, and red tricolor flag is quite meaningful, because when Germany used this flag in the past, it was a world power, so everyone respected this flag. Although it is not certain whether Germany will be able to become a great power in the future, restoring the flag of the glorious era is what the Germans in Shanghai welcome.</p>
<h3>The First Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Northeast Association</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Northeast Association held its first meeting at the association's headquarters at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The attendees included committee members Wang Zhengting, Chen Binqing, Zhao Jinqing, Li Denghui, Guo Bingwen, Chen Liting, Xia Qifeng, Wu Kaisheng, Fan Guang, and Kuang Xukun, totaling ten people. Zang Qifang, the secretary-general of the association, was present. First, Zang Qifang reported on the association's purpose, which is to study Northeast culture and recover the lost land in the Northeast. Then, Chairman Wang Zhengting reported on the recent international situation and assigned each committee member to study the work of foreign relations. Finally, the committee members exchanged many opinions on foreign affairs.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Introduction Center of the China Production and Sales Association Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi and Other Guests Attended, Numbering Hundreds of People</p>
<p>Hundreds of Kinds of Products Were Displayed, Making It a Feast for the Eyes</p>
<p>The National Goods Introduction Center sponsored by the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association officially opened yesterday. Kong Xiangxi, the former Minister of Industry, Mu Ouchu, the former Vice Minister, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and guests from all walks of life, Xu Xinliu, Sun Zuji, Li Wenjie, Huang Zhuming, Yan Esheng, Xi Yushu, Zhao Bingren, Jia Foru, and others, totaling hundreds of people, attended. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry specially sent Mr. Cao Xiuqing from the International Trade Bureau to attend and provide guidance. Directors Fang Yixian, Xiang Kangyuan, Huang Shoumin, Cai Shengbai, Ren Shigang, Ye Youcai, Fang Jiange, Pan Yangyao, Wang Xingyao, Chen Songyuan, Yan Fang, Secretary Huo Yamin, Wang Zhixin, Gu Bingyuan, Zhu Yangchen, and General Manager Xie Yunting of the Introduction Center warmly welcomed the guests. The following is a detailed report on the opening ceremony:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. to show solemnity. It was originally scheduled to be led by Mr. Zhang Gongquan, the chairman of the association, but Mr. Zhang was unable to attend due to illness. Director Fang Yixian presided over the meeting. After the unveiling, the chairman gave a brief welcome speech, followed by Secretary Zhu Yangchen, who reported on the recent association affairs and future work plans on behalf of Secretary-General Du Chongyuan. Director Chen Songyuan and General Manager Xie Yunting also reported on everything in great detail.</p>
<p>Speeches from All Walks of Life: Mr. Mu Ouchu, a senior in the industrial sector, attended the meeting and gave a speech, saying, "In recent years, national goods have made progress by leaps and bounds. The state of their development is truly beyond expectations. Looking at the products of various factories displayed in today's introduction center, not only are the quality excellent, but also the styles are very beautiful. It can be asserted that without introduction, they will be popular for a while. However, I have a word here. National goods manufacturers must not be complacent about this and neglect the improvement of products. They must strive for perfection and work tirelessly. The increase in quantity is certainly important, but the research on quality must be paid more attention to. Because national goods are not just a matter of one industry or one business, but a matter related to the entire undertaking of the country. We must constantly forget to improve and increase the people's belief in national goods, and strive for this final step for the national foundation and the people's livelihood. This time, the Bank of China can directly invest in the industrial and commercial circles and implement cooperation, which can be said to be a guide to supporting industry and commerce, and is especially admirable." Sun Zuji, Huang Zhuming, Li Wenjie, and others also gave speeches, and their words were full of warnings, which moved the listeners.</p>
<p>An Overview of the Products: The center specially opened three exhibition halls to display national goods products. The products of the members were displayed, with no less than hundreds of kinds, which were dazzling and a feast for the eyes. Among them, the silk products of the Meiya Factory, the cosmetics of the China Chemical Industry Society, the woolen fabrics of the Zhanghua Factory, the towels of the Sanyou Industrial Society, the straw hats of the Huafu Factory, the bricks and tiles of the Taishan Factory, the magnetic bricks of the Xingye Factory, the cotton fabrics of the Wuhe Factory, the velvet of the Tongcheng Factory, the porcelain of the China Kiln Industry Company, the enamel products of the Zhonghua Enamel Factory, various industrial machines of the Zhonghua Iron Factory, the matches of the Da Zhonghua Company, the fountain pens of the Guan Leming Factory, the photographic card paper of the Xiaofang Factory, the children's toys of the Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory, the stationery of the Tianzhang Factory, the electrical appliances of the Huasheng Factory, the light bulbs of the Yapu'er Factory, the toothbrushes of the Yixin Factory, the paint of the Zhenhua Factory, the candies of the Guanshengyuan Factory, the canned food of the Kangyuan Factory, the ink of the Lingsheng Factory, the medicines of the Xinya Factory, the steel furniture of the Dahua Iron Factory, the building hardware of the Cooperative Hardware Society, etc., were all of excellent quality, and the visitors praised them. When visiting, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, also bought a bolt of dragon-patterned silk from the Meiya Factory to show his support.</p>
<h3>Manager Talks</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, Xie Yunting, the manager of the National Goods Introduction Center, told a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency that the purpose of the introduction center is to collect the excellent products of various factories, introduce them to domestic and foreign markets, and serve the society to facilitate selection. The work can be divided into two major parts: one is to promote products, and the other is to promote consumption. The former has been carried out in Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Wuzhou, and has also sent personnel to Jiujiang, Hankou, Changsha, Fuzhou, Shashi, Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Huzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, Nantongzhou, and Singapore, Xiaoluson and other fourteen places in Nanyang to discuss and organize introduction branches. As for foreign countries, there have been considerable contacts in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Jinshan, New Zealand, South Africa, North Africa, London, Marseille, Paris, South America, Seattle, etc., and the second step of actual promotion and introduction work can be carried out in the near future. Regarding the promotion of consumption, the National Goods Consumption Cooperative has been organized in Shanghai, and it is planned to promote the establishment of branches in various places, so that consumers have the opportunity to contribute opinions, and producers know the direction of their efforts and research. Production and sales cooperation can achieve its ultimate goal.</p>

<h3>Political Kidnapping Case Occurs on Luban Road</h3>
<p>Korean Revolutionary Party Leader Li Chunshan Kidnapped</p>
<p>Our Military and Police Circles Highly Value This Matter</p>
<p>The mysterious and confusing kidnapping case that occurred at the entrance of Xingxing Lane, Luban Road, in the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office of the South City at 5:45 PM the day before yesterday was reported in detail in this newspaper. However, the identity of the hostage was only revealed after an investigation by the district, which found that the kidnapped person was Li Chunshan (also known as Li Yubi), the leader of the Korean Revolutionary Independence Party, who had already acquired Chinese nationality. The case is entirely politically related and cannot be compared to ordinary kidnapping for ransom. The military and police authorities in the Chinese Concession attach great importance to it and are currently doing their utmost to investigate, so that the case can be clarified as soon as possible. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Black-Plated Car Drove Away in Despair</h3>
<p>At 5:45 PM the day before yesterday, at the entrance of Xingxing Lane, Luban Road, in the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office of the South City, passers-by were suddenly heard shouting about a kidnapping. Soon after, someone ran to the Liyuan Road Police Station, which has jurisdiction over the area, to report that a black-plated car had been parked near the entrance of Xingxing Lane. Not long after, a person riding in a rickshaw passed by, and four or five kidnappers jumped out of the car, dragged the passenger off the rickshaw, and forced him into the car. The passenger shouted that he was being kidnapped. By the time nearby residents heard the sound and rushed out, they only saw the car speeding away. Therefore, the license plate number could not be clearly identified.</p>
<h3>Only a Fedora Hat, No Other Clues</h3>
<p>After the incident, Jin Tian, the district chief of the district, immediately reported to the Inspectorate by telephone and tried his best to investigate. However, apart from finding a gray fedora hat belonging to the kidnapped person at the scene of the incident, there were no other clues to be found. But the result was eventually revealed: the kidnapped person was Li Chunshan, the leader of the Korean Independence Party, who had acquired Chinese nationality. Li is now 49 years old and was born in Pingshan Yijun, Korea. He is the leader of the Sino-Korean Revolutionary Alliance.</p>
<h3>Naturalized in China, Moved to South Shanghai</h3>
<p>On January 19th of this year, Li received Nationality Permit No. 11 issued by the Ministry of Interior of the National Government, officially changing his nationality to Chinese. His family lived at No. 54 Lubao Kangli, French Concession. However, after the January 28th Incident, Li, in view of the fact that Japanese detectives had illegally arrested Koreans in the French Concession by illegal means, and in order to protect his safety, moved to a certain place in the Chinese Concession west of the city.</p>
<h3>Wife Jin Jingji and Children in Tow</h3>
<p>Li's wife is named Jin Jingji, also Korean, 48 years old, and has eight children. The eldest son is only 17 years old, named Wanrong, and studies at the Sino-French School on Mintini Yin Road. The second daughter, Yingyuan, is 15 years old; the third daughter, Yingji, is 13 years old; and the fourth daughter, Yingde, is 10 years old, all studying at Lehua Girls' School. The fifth daughter, Yingqi, is 9 years old; the sixth son, Huirong, is 7 years old; and the seventh daughter, Yingba, is 5 years old, are all studying at Rencheng Elementary School. The eighth son, Junrong, is only three years old and is still in diapers.</p>
<h3>A Sudden Change of Events on the Way to a Friend's Appointment</h3>
<p>Because Li is Korean and a revolutionary leader, he has long been valued by imperialists, who have always wanted to get their hands on him. However, Li's whereabouts were extremely secret, and they were never successful. Li also knew that his situation was dangerous, so he usually kept a low profile and rarely went out, except when it was necessary to go out alone. He had very little contact with the outside world. Unexpectedly, at around 6 PM the day before yesterday, Li, in response to a friend's invitation, braved the rain in a rickshaw to meet Jin Zhigang, a Korean, at No. 2, Lane 190, Xingxing Lane, Luban Road, Lujiiawan, to discuss important matters. He never expected that disaster would strike as soon as he arrived at the entrance of the lane.</p>
<h3>Three Short Bandits, Screams for Help Already Gone</h3>
<p>As soon as Li's rickshaw arrived at the entrance of the lane, a black-plated car parked by the side of the road suddenly had three short bandits jump out. They forced Li into the car and sped away. By the time nearby residents and Li's friend, Mr. Jin, heard the screams and rushed out, the bandit's car was already gone. Only Li's fedora hat was left on the ground. They immediately ran to the Liyuan Road Police Station of the Second District General Office, which has jurisdiction over the area, and reported the matter to the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>District Chief in Difficulty Over Deadline to Solve Case</h3>
<p>At the same time, the Municipal Authorities of the Chinese Concession, upon hearing of Mr. Li's kidnapping, paid great attention and believed that Mr. Li's kidnapping was by no means comparable to ordinary kidnapping for ransom. It must contain significant meaning. They immediately strictly ordered Jin Tian, the district chief of the Second District, which has jurisdiction over the area, to solve the case within a limited time. All Korean residents in Shanghai believed that since the January 28th Incident, the number of Korean residents in the French Concession who had moved to the Second District of the Chinese Concession was very large, and they had repeatedly requested the district government to pay attention to their protection. Now, a revolutionary leader has been kidnapped in broad daylight, and Korean residents are generally feeling insecure.</p>
<h3>Wu Yue'e Sues Zhou Xiangyun for Abandonment</h3>
<p>You plucked the delicate flower first,</p>
<p>Who would gather the withered leaves and branches?</p>
<p>| The complaint contains many words about the decline of beauty. |</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangyun, a wealthy man from Ningbo in Shanghai, is 56 years old and lives at No. 764 Niuzhuang Road. In 1915, he became acquainted with Wu Yue'e, a woman from Dongting. Recently, because Zhou abandoned Wu and ignored her, Wu hired three lawyers, Wu Kaisheng, Fan Gang, and Huang Xiubo, and filed a criminal complaint against Zhou with the First Special District Local Court for abduction and abandonment. The gist of the prosecution is as follows: the plaintiff was engaged to Mr. Lu through matchmaker Wang Zaichun in 1915, and just as they were about to set a date for the engagement ceremony, a neighbor, Mrs. Sheng (daughter of Sheng Xingsheng), told the plaintiff's mother that Zhou Xiangyun of Shanghai, who possessed great wealth, dressed in fine clothes and behaved elegantly, was young and handsome, and was seeking a divine partnership with Miss Xuanna. The plaintiff's mother politely declined, saying that Luo Fu already had a husband. However, the defendant, seeing that things were not going well, asked Mrs. Sheng to invite the plaintiff to a meeting at Yizhixiang. At the meeting, the defendant's eyes never left the plaintiff, and he was almost unable to control himself. After a whispered conversation, he proposed marriage. The plaintiff replied that she was already engaged to Mr. Lu and that it would be difficult to obtain her mother's consent. The defendant said that Mr. Lu was marrying a second wife and had three or four children from his previous wife. If she married him, she would not be free. If she married him, she would be able to do whatever she wanted and be taken care of in every way, as if she were in heaven. If she was willing to marry him, he would take care of everything. His sweet words and honeyed phrases seduced her, and she obeyed his every word. She took the opportunity to escape, and the defendant rented a room upstairs in a street-front house, which he named Long Yu (taking the meaning of clouds following the dragon), as their love nest. He invited the plaintiff to his garden, selected eight pots of peony flowers, and sent them to the residence through a gardener. He sent invitations to friends and held a grand banquet with eight tables. As a result, the news spread far and wide. The plaintiff's mother disowned the plaintiff as her daughter, and Mr. Lu, upon hearing the news, was ashamed to be associated with the plaintiff and declared that the marriage was off. The defendant, seeing that his scheme had succeeded, immediately closed the affair and moved to No. 100 Qinshouli, Jing'an Temple Road, where he lived with the defendant for two years. He paid her 200 yuan per month. The plaintiff repeatedly urged him to fulfill his promise and marry her. The defendant claimed that it was difficult because the plaintiff had not yet given birth to a child. Therefore, he had adopted a daughter in her name for the plaintiff to raise, named Chongxi. From then on, the monthly allowance was only 150 yuan. The plaintiff often complained about the delay in marriage and the reduction in expenses. The defendant came only once or twice a week, and the monthly allowance was often less than 150 yuan. The plaintiff had to raise the girl, which was very expensive, but the monthly allowance was reduced, making it impossible to maintain. Every time they met, there was an argument. Therefore, since 1929, he had disappeared and had not paid any expenses. When she sent someone to invite him, it was like throwing stones into the sea. When they met by chance, he treated her like a stranger. Helplessly, she took the girl to the defendant's mansion, but the gate was heavily guarded, and she had to return empty-handed many times. However, the mother and daughter were alone, living in poverty for five or six years, pawning and borrowing everything they could, and were about to be overwhelmed by debt. The future was bleak and unbearable. The plaintiff believes that her youth, personality, and reputation have been ruined by the defendant. Now she is almost forty years old, her face is fading, and it is difficult to find another marriage partner. As the saying goes, "You plucked the delicate flower first, who would gather the withered leaves and branches?" Her heart is filled with sorrow, and tears wet her clothes. Over time, she has developed an illness. Although she is still alive, her anger is difficult to quell. In addition to filing a separate civil suit for the debts owed and alimony, she has compiled the above facts and requested your court to summon the defendant Zhou Xiangyun to court and punish him according to Article 315 of the Criminal Law and Paragraph 1 of Article 309 of the same law. Yesterday morning, at 10:30, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court of the First Special Court opened the first criminal court to summon Zhou Xiangyun, who arrived with his agents, the three lawyers He, Li, and Peng. First, Wu Yue'e testified that she was 42 years old, from Dongting Mountain, and currently lived at No. 20, Lane 60, Weihaiwei Road. In 1915, the defendant, because he wanted to marry her but failed, designed to have her hang up a sign as a prostitute, so that the Lu family would withdraw from the marriage. His plan succeeded, and he rented a house with her in Qinshoufang. When she hung up the sign as a prostitute, only the defendant accompanied her in and out, as everyone knew. At first, the defendant paid her monthly expenses, but since 1929, he had stopped paying, so she had no choice but to sue. When Zhou Xiangyun was questioned, he claimed that he had never met the plaintiff before and that they had never met. The claim of cohabitation was even more unfounded. Zhou's lawyer then stated that there was a procedural issue in this case that should be investigated and ruled on first. The abandonment alleged by the plaintiff occurred in 1929, and according to the law, the sentence was also less than one year. Therefore, even if the defendant had committed this act, it would be covered by the amnesty. According to Article 310 of the Criminal Law, he should be exempt from prosecution. Furthermore, even if the abduction was only discovered in 1929, according to the law, the statute of limitations for prosecution is six months. Now that the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit after the statute of limitations has expired, the case should be ruled inadmissible. He requested the court to rule on the above two points first. Judge Feng then ordered that the matter be reviewed and handled. The plaintiff's lawyer, Fan Gang, immediately stated that the defendant in this case was trying to deny everything in court today, even claiming that he had never met the plaintiff. He requested that the defendant be ordered to provide bail within a revised timeframe. Judge Feng granted the request and ordered Zhou to submit a bail bond to the court within three days.</p>
<h3>Ming Garden Lawsuit Dismissed</h3>
<p>| Martin Not Liable for Compensation |</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed by the Dog Racing Association against Martin, the current Assistant Inspector-General of the Public Works Department, and former Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mcnaghten, for damages of $2,500,001 due to the closure of the Ming Garden Dog Racing Track by the Public Works Department, was dismissed in relation to Mcnaghten after a ruling by British Judge Grier. Now, the part of the lawsuit against Martin was also decided by the jury the day before yesterday, stating that there were no damages that could be compensated. It was declared that the activities of the Dog Racing Association in Ming Garden were sufficient to hinder order and good government in the concession and were a public nuisance. Martin believed that his actions were under the command of the Public Works Department in the implementation of the Yangjingbang Regulations and were justified. The Public Works Department also had the right to issue the closure order. Judge Grier then formally ruled to dismiss the lawsuit based on the jury's decision, with court costs borne by the plaintiff. This case of the Dog Racing Association has been involved in litigation repeatedly. After the first ruling by the British Consular Court was dismissed, an appeal was filed. Last year, the appellate court overturned the original verdict and ordered a retrial. Now, it has been retried and ruled by Judge Grier.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Collection of Sampan Boat Donations in Wusong</h3>
<p>Rowing Sampans to Make a Living</p>
<p>Going to the Party Headquarters to Request a Reduction by Half</p>
<p>The Wusong Boat Donation Office of the Shanghai Municipal Finance and Public Utilities Bureau has recently sent personnel to collect registration fees of three yuan for sampan ferries in Cao Bang, as well as monthly donations of six cents per month starting from January 1933, totaling one yuan and eight cents for three months, amounting to four yuan and eight cents. Those sampans that were unable to pay had their oars and oils confiscated, causing their business to be suspended and their livelihoods to be cut off. Forced by desperation, dozens of sampan men, women, old and young gathered and went to the Eighth District Party Headquarters to petition, and submitted a request to the directors of the Municipal Finance and Public Utilities Bureau, requesting a reduction in the levy to maintain their livelihoods. The reasons given were that Wusong's situation was different from Shanghai's, and the prosperity and decline of their businesses were very different. Moreover, they suffered greatly during last year's war, which greatly damaged their vitality. After the war, business declined, and their livelihoods were not enough to make ends meet. Housing in the town was scarce, and rents had increased several times, making it impossible for them to rent a place to live. Most of them lived on their boats and made a living by rowing passengers. They only earned two or three copper coins for each passenger. They endured all kinds of hardships every day, such as bitter cold, wind, frost, rain, and scorching heat. Their miserable situation was probably the worst in the world. Moreover, they often encountered strong winds and rainstorms on the way, when the stars and moon were not visible, making it extremely dangerous. The hardship was beyond description. Wang Chengye, a standing committee member of the Eighth District Party Headquarters, agreed to consult with the Boat Donation Office and handle the matter. The men and women were satisfied and dispersed after being told to wait for a solution.</p>
<h3>Frequent Spring Snowfall, Chilly Spring Weather, Difficult to Quickly Disperse the Poor from the Shelter</h3>
<p>Temporarily Continue to Provide Care</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association's Temporary Shelter in South Shanghai is still providing care for more than 1,000 poor people. It was originally scheduled to close at the end of March, but due to the frequent spring snow and the extremely cold weather, the poor people, hearing that they would be dispersed, felt that they would still have no way to make a living after leaving the shelter, and all cried bitterly. The administrator of the shelter, Mr. Zhang Zixin, in order to save people thoroughly, plans to temporarily continue to provide care for the poor people in the shelter and disperse them only when the weather is warmer. He is not too concerned about the expenses and is trying to save on all items. However, the cost of rice for the poor people is still high. The two philanthropists, Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, members of the association, had previously written to all sectors of society to encourage donations. It has been heard that the donors include China General Edison Company with 500 yuan, Zhang Yuqingtang with 150 yuan, Huang Hanzhi with 100 yuan, and Huaiyu with 30 yuan. It is hoped that all philanthropists will continue to donate so that the shelter can continue to operate.</p>
<h3>Yeyuan Amusement Fair Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Jiangwan Yeyuan, initiated by Shanghai philanthropist Wang Yiting and others, is using the beautiful weather and scenery to launch a charity amusement fair. It has been decided that starting today (11th), it will begin to welcome entries for various innovative and elegant amusement items. The categories have been previously published in this newspaper. It is heard that the entry time is from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM every day, and will be postponed in case of rain. It is also heard that from this day on, China General Omnibus will have many vehicles running directly to the front of the park.</p>
<h3>Garment Industry Association Raises Donations for Aviation to Save the Country</h3>
<p>Shanghai Garment Industry Association Standing Committee Members Wu Zhihao, Cui Jiefu, Lu Qisheng, Hao Haishan, Xi Xiaoyun, etc., in view of the fact that our army's resistance against the enemy often suffers from enemy aircraft attacks if there is no aircraft assistance, Shanghai's various groups have raised donations for aviation to save the country, and the garment industry is also unwilling to fall behind. They held a banquet at Hongyunlou last night, with dozens of people including Chuan Tingfang, Zhang Zikang, and Tang Puming. The chairman Wu Zhihao first stated the reasons for the meeting, saying that now that the country is in trouble, and in addition to the heavy rain today, everyone has worked hard and actively participated, which shows that the people's hearts have not died and that there is still hope for the country. Our army lacks aircraft and air defense equipment to resist the enemy, and it is especially important to purchase them as soon as possible. It is hoped that all those present will donate generously and work together to overcome the national crisis, so that our army and national defense will both benefit. More than 4,000 yuan was raised on the spot, and the list is listed below: Wu Zhihao, Lu Qisheng, Futai, Jinchang, Xingji, Gongyi, Yuxiang Gong, the above seven households each donated 200 yuan. Baocheng, Baotai, Yulong, Detai, Taifeng, Yuanyu, Yuankang, Xiangfeng, Tiantian, Shengji, Hefeng, Puji, Cuifeng, Xinyuan, Yongyuan, Jintai, Deyuan, Zhang Zikang, the above eighteen households each donated 100 yuan. Qiaoyuan, Gantai, Tongtai, Shen Xiehe, Xiepin, Tongtai, Tongfeng, Yuanfeng, Yuanchang, Zhang Fengyuan, Hao Haishan, Ye Xingfang, Zhou Zuoqing, Tang Jinming, the above fourteen households each donated 50 yuan. You Jichen, He Shuxiang, Dingji, the above three households each donated 30 yuan. The rest are still being solicited, and the total will be considerable.</p>
<h3>National Medical Center's Shanghai Branch Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>Reports on the Future Direction of the Center</p>
<p>The Organization Method is Divided into Four Steps</p>
<p>Chinese medicine has a history of more than 4,000 years, with inventions in every generation. However, due to the lack of a unified advocacy organization, and with family learning and apprenticeship, it is inevitably complicated. Therefore, Mr. Tan Yankai, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Jiao Yitang, and other gentlemen suggested to the Central Political Conference that a National Medical Center be established, using scientific methods to organize, improve the treatment of diseases, and methods of making medicine. This was decided in seventy-six National Affairs Conferences, and the Executive Yuan was instructed to prepare for the establishment of the Central National Medical Center and ordered all provinces and cities to establish branches to promote it. The Shanghai branch was established on January 15th of this year. In order to actively organize Chinese medicine and publicize the efficacy of Chinese medicine, the center hosted the press at Yizhixiang last night. More than 80 people, including reporters from various newspapers, famous doctors, and Lu Zhong'an, director of the center, attended. During the meeting, Chairman Cai Jiben reported on the center's future work direction, saying that the current method of organizing Chinese medicine has been divided into four steps: (1) First, investigate the medical situation of the city</p>
<h3>Another Dog Case</h3>
<p>Dispute Over a Sick Dog</p>
<p>The lawsuit of the Ming Garden Dog Racing Track was just concluded the day before yesterday, but yesterday the British Consular Court had another lawsuit regarding damages related to dog racing, as if it were an aftershock. This time, a valuable race dog named John Haig suffered from arthritis in one toe of its left front leg. The plaintiff, Fudge, accused the defendant, Guo Date, of negligence of duty, resulting in the injury, and demanded compensation for damages. The defendant denied negligence of duty and responsibility for the dog's injury. The case is currently being tried by a Justice Shi of the court.</p>
<p>Situation and prepare statistics for organization. When performing duties, local authorities must be asked for assistance when necessary; (2) Establish an Academic Research Committee, with seventeen to twenty-nine members, and organize them into departments; (3) Establish an Academic Guidance Committee. To promote open academic research, eminent Chinese and Western medical experts will be invited to be members; (4) Allocate regular expenses. The board of directors has decided that for every prescription written by a doctor in the city, a center fee of one cent will be attached. Each doctor will first send the prescription to the center to pay the fee and stamp it, and a receipt will be issued at any time. Pharmacies will recognize this stamp as proof of a legitimate doctor and sell medicine accordingly. Prescriptions for diagnosis and treatment in Shantang Hospital and prescriptions for self-medication by patients may be exempted as appropriate. The organization of the center, in addition to establishing various academic research committees, has two vice-directors and thirty-seven directors. All matters related to the organization of Chinese medical academics and business, the improvement of Chinese medicine, and the management, supervision, and other matters are within the scope of the center's responsibility.</p>
<h3>Record of People's Movements</h3>

<h3>Opening and Dredging of the Puhui Pond Determined</h3>
<p>Municipal Councilors Request Additional Budget</p>
<p>The opening and dredging of the Puhui Pond in West Shanghai was initiated by Ma Xiangbo, an elderly man of ninety-four years. It was later diverted and dredged to Songjiang and Qingpu counties, and construction has begun. It is learned that the Shanghai section has been divided into six sections by the Public Works Bureau for bidding. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, the bids were opened publicly in the Public Works Bureau. Huang Rixin, the audit director of the Third Section of the Municipal Government, was sent by the Municipal Government to supervise, and Wu Hengzhong, secretary of the Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government, and Municipal Councilors also attended the ceremony. As a result of the bidding, Shen Rongji won the first, fourth, and fifth sections, Lu Yuelou won the second section, Zhang Zhensheng won the third section, and Wang Lianji won the sixth section, with a total bid price of 111,006 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, and 8 li. However, the city's budget is only 100,000 yuan. According to the budget, the amount of earthwork must be reduced. Yang Xinzheng, Chen Yaofu, and others have requested Director Shen to submit the request to the Municipal Government to add to the budget, because the councilors have a close relationship with the river, which has been blocked for a long time. According to the bureau's calculations, the amount of earthwork cannot be reduced any further. Director Shen has agreed to submit the request.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Relief for Disaster Areas in Northeast China</h3>

Please raise funds for relief so that I can take them with me for relief. We will meet soon. I will not go into details. I wish you well."</p>
<p>Philippine Overseas Chinese Remit Donations The association also received a letter from the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Legazpi, Philippines, yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir, since the eastern neighbor invaded, it has been more than a year, and our compatriots have been groaning under the iron hooves of the tyrannical Japanese every moment. We, as nationals, although far away overseas, if we are not made of wood or stone, how can we not be moved? The Chinese Consul General in the Philippines (Xu Kun) has allocated two donation books to your association. We have raised 163 Philippine pesos, which were remitted to your association by the Consul General stationed in Manila on the 24th of this month. We hope you will take note and remit the funds to the disaster areas in Northeast China to help the refugees, doing our duty as citizens."</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Man and Woman Cleverly Abduct Songjiang Girl</h3>
<p>Passengers Had Different Tickets</p>
<p>Accents and Circumstances Differed</p>
<p>At the Fanwangdu Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, at around 5 PM yesterday, when the No. 39 slow train, which had departed from the Zhakou at 10 AM, arrived, three passengers, an old woman, a man, and a girl, disembarked at Fanwangdu. The old woman and the man spoke with a Jiangbei accent, but the girl spoke with a Songjiang accent. The railway police officer at the station, Bo Yunlong, found the trio suspicious, questioned them, and their answers were evasive. Upon checking the man and woman's tickets, they had boarded at Songjiang and purchased tickets to Fanwangdu Station. However, the girl's half-price ticket was from Songjiang to the North Station. It was clear that there was an abduction involved, so the man, woman, and girl were all detained and taken to the railway police chief at the South Station for questioning. The police chief, Wang Youzhang, first questioned the man, who identified himself as Wang Lianyou, 34 years old, from Yancheng. He stated, "I met the old woman, Shan Changshi, at Miss Lu Da's house. Today, I traveled with her from Songjiang to Fanwangdu Station to visit my elder sister. I don't know the girl who is with the old woman; she was brought by the old woman. I helped the old woman take a rickshaw after getting off at Fanwangdu Station, and out of kindness, I asked the girl to ride in the rickshaw with me. I intended to send her to my relatives, not to abduct her." The old woman stated her name was Shan Changshi, 60 years old, from Yancheng. She said, "I don't know the man who came with me; I only met him at Songjiang Station while waiting for the train. I also don't know the girl. When boarding the train at the station, he asked me to come to Shanghai with him, and I agreed. He bought his own ticket. At Fanwangdu Station, the girl got off the train with me. When the man hired a rickshaw for me, the police came to question us, and we were detained." The girl stated her name was Zhang A'nan, 10 years old, from Songjiang. Her father's name is Zhang Changyu, and they live near Songjiang Station. "Today, I was playing at the station when I met an old woman and a man, both of whom I didn't know. They both said they would take me to Shanghai to find my mother and that Shanghai would be a fun place to play. The old woman gave me a ticket, and I boarded the train with them. The three of us sat together on the train. After getting off, the old woman asked me to ride in a rickshaw with her to go to Fanwangdu to find my mother. Just as we were about to get on the rickshaw and leave, the police brought us here, and we couldn't leave." After questioning by Police Chief Wang, the statements were found to be inconsistent, clearly indicating a joint abduction, which could not be denied. Furthermore, the tickets purchased by the suspect Wang Lianyou and the woman Shan Changshi were from Songjiang Station to Fanwangdu Station, but the half-price ticket purchased for the girl Zhang A'nan was from Songjiang to the North Station. This was undoubtedly a calculated plan to have the girl sit in the same car and avoid suspicion during questioning. Given that this case involved abduction, separating family members, and was indeed unlawful, a written report was prepared, and police were dispatched to escort them to the local court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Zheng Buxiang's Cause of Death Unknown</h3>
<p>Male Corpse Beside the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</p>
<p>At around 2 AM yesterday, police officers Tian Xiancheng and Liu Junde from the Tanzhiwan Sub-Bureau of the Zhabei Fourth District Public Security Bureau were patrolling near the Beijing-Shanghai Railway (behind Yangongtang), about three li west of the Dayang Bridge. They noticed an umbrella and used a flashlight to investigate further. They then discovered a male corpse lying beside the tracks. Initially suspecting that he had been hit by a train, they immediately returned to the station to report the incident. Inspector Ge Weirui immediately dispatched Police Chief Wang Junjie, along with police officers, and summoned the local headman Zhang Fengqi to investigate. They found a gunshot wound near the left ear of the deceased, with the bullet still lodged inside. They also found two six-inch White Langlin pistol shell casings near the body, along with the umbrella, and took them all to the station. They also instructed the headman to report the incident to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. The court then appointed a prosecutor and a coroner to examine the body in the afternoon and instructed the family to claim the body and await the arrest of the murderer for interrogation. It was later learned that the deceased was Zheng Buxiang, 25 years old, from Yancheng. His elderly mother, Zheng Zhengshi, lives at No. 289, East Panjiaqiao, in the Dafeng Yarn Factory workers' quarters. He had previously served as a patrol officer in the concession for a long time. Perhaps he was assassinated by a criminal gang because of this.</p>
<h3>Two Fires</h3>
<p>At around 5 AM yesterday, a fire broke out in a straw shed in the Baojiazhai area of Huayuan Road in the Nanshi district. The flames quickly spread, engulfing the roof. In an instant, nine straw sheds were destroyed. Fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. It took over half an hour to put it out. The arsonist, Ding Shaozhang, was detained by the local Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the home of Zhang Yunhong at No. 80 Haichang Road, Zhabei, due to carelessness while cooking, leaving a fire unattended outside the stove. The fire quickly spread, affecting the neighboring houses at Nos. 82 and 83, resulting in the destruction of three houses in total. The Zhabei Second Section Fire Brigade arrived and extinguished the fire after some time.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the 24th Branch of the Municipal Federation</h3>

(2) Regarding the letter from Executive Committee member Zhang Shuliang requesting to resign due to being overburdened with affairs, it was resolved to persuade him to stay. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Chinese Electric Company Union</h3>
<p>Negotiating Pension Issues</p>
<p>Since 1925, the Chinese Electric Company, out of consideration for the hardship of its workers, on the proposal of the company's deputy manager, Zhu Kongjia, allocated a portion of the company's annual public dividends as a pension fund for aging workers, that is, a public reserve fund. To date, it has accumulated 94,000 yuan. Currently, due to unequal treatment by the company, these funds have been allocated to employees, which the entire workforce strongly opposes. They are demanding that the company allocate all funds to the workers for equal distribution. Upon hearing this, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, fearing a labor strike, dispatched executive director Tan Honglin and others to mediate and guide the entire workforce. The union is actively engaging with the company to negotiate and has submitted a request to the party and government authorities for a fair resolution, awaiting mediation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We have recently read in the news column of your newspaper on the 10th that the Yu (presumably a mistake for Yu) Jiang Steamer, which had been missing for a long time, had sunk off Hainan Island, and claimed that it was overladen with coal and suffered misfortune in the face of a hurricane, etc. The fact that the Yu Long Steamer sailed from Hongji on December 8th of last year and went missing in March is indeed true. However, although our company has tried its best to inquire with all parties concerned, there is still no evidence to support the news that the ship has sunk. However, in order to understand the whereabouts of the ship, we are still continuing to investigate in all directions. Furthermore, according to the Yu Long Steamer, the weight of the ship is 2,700 tons, and the coal loaded this time is less than 2,450 tons, there is no overloading situation, all of which are corrected to correct the truth and avoid the public from hearing. This is to request the Master of the Shen Bao to understand. Yu Long Steamer Co., Ltd. March 10th.</p>
<p>To the Editor, We recently read the news in the third page of your newspaper that the anti-Japanese paintings in the cigarettes of the Shanghai Fuxin Tobacco Company are enemy goods. We were shocked to hear this. The anti-Japanese paintings used by the Fuxin Company are all printed by our company. The paper materials used by our company are all purchased from various paper shops and have invoices and vouchers to prove, and are by no means enemy goods. Our company has always been patriotic, and how could we use enemy goods? Now the Fuxin Company has seriously negotiated with several companies. This matter concerns the reputation of the company. In addition to sending a letter to the guild requesting correction, our company shall be responsible for all adverse results caused by the enemy goods. I hereby write to your newspaper, and I request you to correct it. To the Shen Bao. Fuhua Printing Company. March 10th.</p>

<h3>Women's Liberation and Family Problems</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Ms. Yang Yuwen of Hankou丨</p>
<p>I have a difficult problem and ask you to sacrifice a little of your precious time to give me concrete guidance. Unfortunately, I lost my mother early and have suffered all the hardships of the world. Fortunately, I studied for several years and gained some knowledge. Unexpectedly, my stubborn father, when I was only one year away from graduating high school, used coercive means to marry me off to a completely unfamiliar and extremely corrupt family. At that time, because I had been studying at school for a long time, I did not understand the situation of old families at all. I thought that with a dowry of one thousand yuan, I could continue my studies after marriage. But I didn’t know that my mother-in-law's family not only refused but also said some sarcastic remarks. Less than a year later, I gave birth to a daughter. So, the matter of studying was temporarily put aside. I am focusing on raising my child so that she becomes a useful person and serves the country. This is my obligation to the country. However, the environment does not allow me to do this. If I compromise to the environment, my mental and physical suffering will be too great, and I will definitely have difficulty living out my natural lifespan. Since coming to my mother-in-law's house, in less than half a year, I have contracted asthma and nearly died! My death is not a big deal, but I do not want my child to suffer the pain of losing a mother again. Alas, sir, you must not understand the plight of being a daughter-in-law in an old-fashioned family. My blunt pen cannot describe even one ten-thousandth of it. In short, my mother-in-law is extremely cunning, vicious, and fierce. Her poor mouth is always on me all day long, and I really have no peace of mind or sleep. Sometimes she even listens to the instigation of my younger sister-in-law, younger uncle, and servants and scolds me severely and threatens to hit me, making me helpless. I have no choice but to kneel down and apologize to make her stop. No matter how they abuse me, I am not allowed to utter a sound or shed a tear, because my mother-in-law says that if there is any slight displeasure in her family, she will not spare us. Sir! People are not made of wood or stone, how can they not be worried and get sick! Every time I want to get out of this dark family, but there is no ill will between my husband and me, and I especially can't bear to leave my little darling! My child is almost half a year old, so I have to swallow my anger and barely survive. Ah, for all eternity, when will I be able to escape this hell on earth! To say something against my conscience, my mother-in-law is young. Even if I wait until my hair turns white, it will be difficult to have my voice heard. As for separation, it is impossible, because her family has always advocated a large family system. Not only will it not succeed, but she will also say that I am alienating her mother-son relationship, and the family finances cannot be divided. Especially my husband, who is only nineteen years old (more than five years younger than me) and has never been to school (his Chinese is very good), has not lost his boyishness and is very afraid of his mother. How can he save me from the sea of suffering! There are many brothers, and exclusively dividing up a little ancestral property is ultimately not a good plan. My temperament has always been upright, and I am unwilling to live a life worse than that of an inhuman. Thinking about the fundamental reason why women are persecuted, it is nothing more than the fact that they cannot be economically independent. I urgently need a job now, but I have no special skills. Where can I find a job? I am thinking of going to a cram school while also taking time to go to a certain school to learn sewing and weaving, but who will take care of my nursing infant? How can I get the permission of those stubborn people? If this last glimmer of hope fails, if I am bullied by them again, I will definitely implement a separation or divorce. Please tell me the procedures for separation or divorce. Will my maternal family interfere? As a weak and helpless woman with no one to rely on, being within the sphere of influence of the evil forces of my maternal and marital families, can I prevail in law? And can my beloved child be raised by me to adulthood? This is the biggest problem! Kind-hearted sir who helps the world, please guide this lost lamb!</p>
<p>Answer: Reply to the letter briefly as follows: (1) The lady's family pain is a general phenomenon of old Chinese families. For the present, the best way is to resolutely abandon everything and go out to seek independent living. This method is the most thorough and straightforward. Considering the lady's intentions, I am afraid that this level cannot be achieved, so one must (2) discuss with your husband and the two of you think of a way to make a living. Or ask your husband to come out to make a living first, or you come out to make a living first. I think your writing is very fluent and your handwriting is also very neat. If you can find a clerical job, there will be a way, because the reason why you are suffering from family pain is because you cannot be economically independent. Economic independence will solve more than half of the problem. However, since your husband is a "boyish" nineteen-year-old youth and does not have the courage to resist the old family, then I can't think of a perfect solution. (3) There is another way: first, encourage your father-in-law to come out to study and let him come to a big city to breathe the civilization of the industrial society. Perhaps it will slowly digest his boyishness. However, there is also a danger here that the lady must consider. That is, if he really absorbs the civilized air of industry and builds up his courage to resist the old family, then his vision will inevitably increase. Since you are a few years older than him, are you afraid that he will "see something different and move his heart" and "abandon the old and seek the new"? But for the time being, you don't have to worry too much. If he really treats you unfairly at that time, you can step aside or take your child and live your own life, and you will have nothing to be ashamed of. At present, if a woman is determined to get rid of a evil family, the law will not have any forced obedience.</p>

<h3>Wet Faction and Wine Barrel</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The Prohibition Law, which was suspended after being approved by three-quarters of the forty-eight states in the United States, has been satisfied for more than thirteen years from its promulgation in 1920 until the day Roosevelt took office this year in March.</p>
<p>The Americans who advocate prohibition are the Drys, and those who oppose prohibition are the Wets. There are more Drys in the Republican Party and more Wets in the Democratic Party. In mid-November last year, Roosevelt was elected President, and the Wet faction of the Democratic Party rose. This newspaper reported that in the recent bizarre entourage of Mr. Luo's inauguration, there was a wine shop dragging a wine barrel, which was a grand demonstration by the Wet faction. With Roosevelt, who relaxes the ban on alcohol, as the head of state, the general foreign-style, Liu Ling and Li Taibai, should applaud the marching wine barrel and shout their slogans wildly.</p>
<p>I think it would be best to have articles praising the three-day wine journey written on the flags in front of the wine barrel, so that it can further promote the Wet faction. Bai Xiangshan of our country is a giant in the Wet faction. He has a poem praising wine that is even better than Liu Ling's Ode to the Virtue of Wine. I will write it down below. If someone translates it into a foreign poem and presents it to the Wet faction comrades in the New World, it would be an excellent gift.</p>
<p>The wine in the cup is full and clear, and it does not boast of its own merits; If I don't boast, people won't know, so I will speak for it now: When a good general faces a great enemy, he leads thousands of soldiers; They drink a single cup into the river, and their hearts are as one in facing death. A strong man grinds his seven heads, and his courage and anger roar; A single drunk forgets his revenge, and his four limbs are as boneless. When Donghai killed the filial wife, the sky changed early and lasted for months; A single sip stopped the drought, and the rain did not stop all night. The atmosphere of the Qin prison in Xianyang, the grievances and pains were condensed into matter; It refuses to dissipate for thousands of years, but a single watering also dissipates it. Moreover, the hatred of children, and the sorrow and pain of the secluded; A quick drink will eliminate everything, like frost receiving the spring sun, Only then do I know that wine is the most spiritual, and nothing can compare to it.</p>
<p>The power of wine, the authority of wine, whether in the Old World or the New World, cannot be ignored for a lifetime.</p>
<h3>Important People and Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Juan Yun</p>
<p>丨My Fantasy丨</p>
<p>The busy legs of newspaper reporters [running around and interviewing] allow us to often read profound theories and brilliant insights in the newspaper. Naturally, the actions of important people and celebrities can be used as news material. Important people and celebrities are the pillars of society.</p>
<p>But important people and celebrities are divided into two types. In the country, there are important people who preside over national affairs, in the city government there are important people who preside over municipal affairs, and in business there are also important people in the business world. Perhaps I think that Lao Wang, who drives the streetcar, is also an important person, because his family of seven depends on him driving the car to make a living.</p>
<p>It's just that he is considered an important person in his own family, but he is not necessarily considered an important person in other people's eyes. Someone who is considered an important person in China is not necessarily considered an important person in the eyes of foreigners. Or, he was considered an important person before, but after losing power or dying, he can no longer be considered an important person.</p>
<p>Therefore, the title of "important person" is only applicable during the period of power.</p>
<p>Celebrities seem to be different. Whether in the past, present, or future, we always admire them and respectfully call them XX celebrities.</p>
<p>There are many, many celebrities. Those who write novels are called famous novelists, those who write poems are called famous great poets. Whether studying philosophy, science, politics, law, economics, or medicine, they can be admired everywhere. There are several reputable celebrities in the entire world, and as small as a county or town. I have always had a strange dream in my life, dreaming that I will also become a celebrity.</p>
<p>Last month, I saw a special dispatch about Xiao Bonai visiting the Temple of Heaven in Beiping. I can very much recall that I have visited the Temple of Heaven three times. It really makes me admire him, because Xiao Bonai is a celebrity, especially a world celebrity. There are quite a few celebrities in Shanghai who have already done many great and amazing things. What others often say and what is published in the newspapers, whether it is the directors of various banks, the founders of companies, saving the country and raising relief funds, municipal affairs, and the business community, it seems that among so many people in Shanghai, only a few Shanghai celebrities are enthusiastic! I often think that if I could be lucky enough to become a Shanghai celebrity, it would naturally be very difficult. Dreams cannot become reality, and I was born with a pitiful skeleton! At least I cannot cope with these versatile and great various undertakings, but I always fantasize like this, maybe I will become a celebrity.</p>
<p>Pig</p>
<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>丨Useless Myself丨</p>
<p>There are some beggars in Shanghai who specialize in following people, stepping in their footsteps and shaking a paper funnel to ask for money. This kind of begging is called pig driving. They treat the benefactors as pigs. There is a kind of bandit in Shanghai who specializes in hiding in remote and dark places, waiting for a single man to walk by lonely and cool. The bandits shout, raise their guns, and rush forward to strip the single man's clothes. This kind of robbery is called pig killing, and they also treat the robbed person as a pig. Giving money to beggars and giving clothes to bandits, but in the end, he got the title of pig, in this age of declining morals, a good person really can't do it.</p>
<p>Some people say that China is a sleeping pig. Oh my! I dare not, dare not. One agreement, one condition, nibble on this piece, dig on that piece. Our China is a country with great capacity for generosity, doing some good deeds, and not caring at all. You love to pick up what, just pick up what, ask for it, what, strangely pathetic. Oh, no, like this mother-in-law, he drove the pig. This is not okay, a good person can't do it. Oh, it's even more wrong, not giving alms, the beggar becomes a bandit, a shout, the gun pointed at the head, if you don't obey, he will pull the trigger, if you obey, he will strip your clothes, and carry out pig killing. It's very pitiful, China is always in a position of being driven and killed, where does this come from?</p>
<p>Being driven by beggars is annoying, but you can call the patrol to catch them. But when the patrol comes, the beggars leave, and you can't do anything about it. Being stripped of clothes by bandits, you can report the arrest, but by the time the patrol arrives, the bandits have gone far away. It is said that this kind of patrol who is willing to follow you to catch beggars and thieves, releasing a horse after the fact, is considered good. Some irresponsible patrols, you go and tell him with all your sweat, but he smiles indifferently and says, Pig, why don't you catch the beggar or robber? Now they have run away, why are you so anxious?</p>
<p>Alas, pig, useless myself, what's good to say!</p>
<h3>Dragon Lantern and Puyi</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhihen</p>
<p>丨Is it One or Two?丨</p>
<p>Puyi, what did I think you were? Originally, it was a dragon lantern that was being manipulated by people. Why do I say this? Listen to me!</p>
<p>A few days ago, dragon lanterns were set off in Taicang City, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand. I lived in the most lively central area, sat by the window on the floor, and looked out into the distance, feasting my eyes. After dusk, people from all over the city gathered enthusiastically on both sides of the street, waiting for the arrival of these dragon lanterns competing for beauty and splendor. Soon, one or two firecrackers broke the silence in the distance, followed by loud cheers from the crowd, saying: [The dragon lantern is here, the dragon lantern is here,] Sure enough, the music team walked slowly, noisily beating ancient Chinese gongs and drums. In an instant, the lights were all lit up, and several lifelike dragon lanterns were already in front of us. Suddenly, there were firecrackers that shook the roof tiles, vibrating our eardrums. The dragon lantern danced, twisting and turning into the sky. Inside the dragon's body, there were lights of various colors, and the two dragon eyes were made of dry electricity, and the light flickered, dazzling people's eyes. Looking at the dancing posture of those dragon lanterns from a distance, who wouldn't say they are just like real dragons? But looking closely, the abdomen of the dragon lantern is supported by a dozen short bamboo sticks, and a dozen people each hold a stick, manipulating these almost lifelike dragon lanterns. Ah! Dragon lantern, dragon lantern! I thought you were dancing freely, who knew you were being held and moved by people?</p>
<p>Puyi, who is called the executive in the Northeast, is said to want to call himself solitary and widowed. In his own opinion, it is not that he is taking advantage of the time to [rise like a dragon]; even among the group of [followers], they also regard him as the true son of heaven with [dragon patterns and phoenix posture], but in the eyes of others, what is the difference between this Puyi executive and the dragon lantern manipulated by others? Look! Those many dwarves are pulling him along!</p>
<p>Puyi, ah! What did I think you were? Originally, it was a dragon lantern that was being manipulated by people.</p>
<p>Long novel</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Genshui</p>
<p>In the first episode, Zhao Ziqiang said cordially, pushing the food: Old lady, don't worry, although I am a soldier, I don't take advantage of others. As the saying goes: Good iron is not used to make nails, and good people don't become soldiers. I don't agree with this sentence. Soldiers work for the country, how much money do they get? They eat mixed noodle nests and wear ragged clothes, but they are all doing things that sell their lives. Of course, there are also bad brothers, but it's not that people become bad as soon as they become soldiers, nor is it that good people don't become soldiers. It's just because the people who recruit soldiers don't recruit good people to be soldiers at all. Besides, being a soldier is really hard. Generally, as long as people can cope with it, they won't become soldiers. Look, I am a soldier, but I am a little different from other soldiers. As he spoke, he walked straight into the courtyard. Jiang also felt that this person spoke very frankly and accompanied him, walking all the way to the courtyard. The courtyard is three north rooms and two east-west厢 rooms. An upper person, with a servant, is living a good life here. Zhao Ziqiang looked through all the rooms inside and out, and then said to Jiang: I know that your family has a simple population, and there is no one in my family. Our old master is very old-fashioned, please rest assured. Jiang said: What are we worried about, living with people like you, what's wrong with that? Zhao Ziqiang laughed: To be honest, people always think that good people don't become soldiers, so they are not happy to be with anyone. Even if you say you are renting a house, the landlord is afraid that you won't pay the rent. Jiang laughed: You are joking. Zhao Ziqiang said seriously: I am telling the truth. Even renting this house: I also asked several people to talk to the landlord, to make sure there was nothing wrong, and paid three months' rent in advance, and then I rented it. In short, we soldiers are always looked down upon. After speaking, he sighed, and then said: I always hope that we soldiers can win back this tone. As he spoke, he came out again. Jiang felt that this person spoke very frankly, and there was a bit of joy in his heart, so she quickly said: Company commander, sit down in our house, would you like to have a cup of tea first? Zhao Ziqiang stood and thought for a while, and laughed: Okay, I should also go to your house to pay my respects. So Jiang led the way in front, opened the wind door, and let him in. (8)</p>
<p>Shanghai Night Talk</p>
<h3>Strolling Under the Neon Lights</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Neon lights flash everywhere with horizontal Chinese characters, vertical Roman letters CAFE, and Arabic numerals 1234. The show at the Paris Grand Theater ended at half past five. From the store selling phonographs, the sound of [The Melody of a Virgin's Heart] is broadcast using a loudspeaker. The short needle of the Mito Night Light Standard clock points to the VII character. I hear in my ear: [The Big Evening News…Extra Edition of the Old Shen Bao]. In front of me is the window display of a cosmetics store: powder, perfume, lipstick, and KOTEX are displayed together.</p>
<p>A siren sounds, and the blood-red light turns yellow. Trams, cars, rickshaws, and fish move forward. Cars, cars, people, people, people, trams, trams, people, people, people, rickshaws, rickshaws, people, people, people, trams, cars, rickshaws, people, people, people.</p>
<p>In the glass window of the Geneva watch shop, the platinum watch emits dazzling brilliance, and the long and short hands are quietly frozen on the white porcelain dial. In the large glass frame of a certain lady's photo studio, portraits of urban men and women are pasted: a white-haired Western girl, a broad-nosed Shanghai lady, a soldier with a chest full of medals, a naked Western baby, and a foreign old lady wearing fashionable new clothes and a wig.</p>
<p>The seasonal fruits in the glass window of the grocery store, red apples, green lettuce, green olive oil sardines, scarlet blood oranges, and golden Guangdong bananas, are brightly colored, tempting the appetites of white Russian vagrants on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The window display of the candy and bread shop is like opening a painting exhibition, displaying gorgeously decorated candy boxes. Each box is a bright picture, Swiss snow scenery, a naked jade-skinned seductive woman wearing light gauze, a lucky black cat, a French Louis dynasty lady wearing a large pleated skirt and holding a small parasol, and a Hollywood romantic movie star. Next to the Santa Claus idol in a white beard and red robe, there is a chocolate Chinese pagoda.</p>
<p>Bright electric light signs are hung one after another at the entrance of the alley: Turkey, Khitan, Paris, Harbin, Greater Shanghai, and geographical place names are used up. There are also palace, Xuan palace, ... palace-like names, but narrow massage parlors like pigeon lofts.</p>
<p>At the crossroads, on the left and right are car parks: French Citroen, Renault; Italian Fiat; American Nash. Behind a Ford car is a special large car for the foreign embassy.</p>
<p>[Jehol lost...Tang Yulin fled...Zhang Xueliang is anxious...He Yingqin arrives in Beijing...Antiques moved to Shanghai...Great earthquake in the East...Chiang Kai-shek arrives in Baoding...] The boys selling evening newspapers and the old guns with smoky faces are rushing and shouting.</p>
<p>The patrol calmly blows the whistle, turning on the street lights: trams, cars, rickshaws, people, people, people, rickshaws, trams, cars, people, people, people.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Beijing-Tianjin Education Federation Visit He Yingqin</h3>

<p>General Association of Teachers and Staff of National Universities Established in Beiping</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Liu Shichuan and Song Jie, representatives of the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of National Universities in Beijing and Tianjin, visited He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, at Jurentang, Zhonghai, at 10:00 am on the 8th. They requested that elite troops from various provinces be transferred north to join the troops stationed at the Yuguan Pass and along the Great Wall to recover Jehol and the lost territory of the Northeast on a specific date. They did not know He Yingqin's whereabouts in advance, so the two representatives, Liu and Song, still went to Jurentang, but returned without meeting him. According to the guard's words to the representatives, Minister He had already left for Baoding by car on the evening of the 7th to welcome Chairman Chiang. So the two representatives, Liu and Song, left a letter and left. The original letter is recorded below. Dear Sir, The fall of Jehol has endangered North China, and the people of the country share the debt, causing laughter from all nations. In addition to having telegraphed the government to severely punish the generals who lost the territory and implement emergency measures in wartime, the association has appointed representatives Song Jie and Liu Shichuan to visit you, requesting that elite troops from various provinces be transferred north to join the troops stationed at the Yuguan Pass and along the Great Wall to recover Jehol and the lost territory of the Northeast on a specific date, in order to wash away the national shame. Please grant us an audience. We are looking forward to it. Sincerely, He, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, from the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff of National Universities in Beijing and Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Liu Shi-chuan's Interview</h3>
<p>A reporter specially interviewed Liu Shi-chuan, a representative of the Beiping-Tianjin Teachers' Association, to inquire about the association's purpose in visiting He Yingqin and the situation of organizing the National Federation of Teachers and Staff for Resistance Against Japan. According to his reply, as follows: Our association held an emergency meeting of the standing committee and decided to send representatives to visit the minister. However, Minister He had gone to Baoding to welcome Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, so he was not able to meet with him. After Minister He returns to Beiping, we will visit him again. There are two purposes for the visit: (1) Please immediately dispatch elite troops from various provinces north to join the garrison troops at Yuguan and along the Great Wall to recover Rehe and the lost territories of the Northeast within a limited time to avenge the national humiliation. (2) Inquire about the central government's preparations for resisting Japan. As for the Beiping-Tianjin Teachers' Association initiating the organization of the National Federation of Teachers and Staff for Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Mou Mo, the liaison representative for the third district, has been in contact in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places, and has reportedly made considerable progress. Mr. Jia Cheng-zhang, the liaison representative for the fourth district, has arrived in Guangzhou to contact and organize the National Federation of Teachers and Staff for Resistance Against Japan. The general association will be located in Beiping, with branch associations in various provinces and important commercial ports such as Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin. Its purpose is to take the recovery of Rehe and the lost territories of the Northeast as the standard. Teachers and staff nationwide should lead the people of the whole country, vowing to resist Japan with one heart and one mind, he said.</p>
<h3>Yanjing University</h3>
<p>The Yanjing University Chinese Teachers and Staff Anti-Japanese Association held a meeting in the Saint Building on the 8th and decided to send a telegram to the National Government requesting punishment for Tang [Yulin], and to request Chiang Kai-shek to quickly go north to supervise the army. The original telegram is recorded below: To the National Government: The national territory of Rehe has fallen into enemy hands again, and the overall situation is deteriorating to this extreme. One mistake after another, how can North China be used as resources for a strong enemy? We hope the government will strictly enforce military discipline, and those who desert their posts, such as Tang Yulin, should be sentenced to death. We especially hope that Chairman Chiang will go north to supervise the army immediately, internally to restore the morale of the people, and externally to maintain international dignity. When international trust and popular support are gained, then the government can survive. This is an unchanging truth. Respectfully, the Yanjing University Chinese Teachers and Staff Anti-Japanese Association of Beiping.</p>
<p>The Process of the European Education Survey Group's Investigation (1)</p>
<h3>Investigation Work in Europe</h3>
<p>Q: How was the investigation work in Europe conducted? A: The League of Nations' investigation of China's education was conducted by the International Institute of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations. Although the Chinese European Education Survey Group was dispatched by the Chinese government, its work in Europe mostly cooperated with the International Institute of Intellectual Co-operation, as China is a member of the institute. The institute's duties are also to promote international cultural communication, exchange, and mutual assistance. The education survey group set sail from Shanghai on August 5th, heading directly to Italy. At the end of August, they arrived in Geneva and met with the institute's staff and Dr. Rajchman, the director of the League of Nations Health Organization, who has always expressed sympathy for China. Before our group arrived in Europe, they had already planned the countries to be investigated, the investigation schedule, and the matters that should be cooperated with each country, and obtained the assistance of various countries. The original plan stipulated an investigation period of four months, the first three months in Poland, Germany, and France, and the last month in the United Kingdom (but the United Kingdom was not yet fully confirmed at that time). The plan set by the institute was indeed very thoughtful. However, the members of our group believed that the education systems of various European countries each had their own strengths, and if we could not observe the education of all important countries, it would be difficult to fulfill the government's original intention in dispatching us. Therefore, we discussed with the institute about adding Italy, Denmark, Austria, and Soviet Russia, and asked the institute to seek the consent of these countries. At the same time, we submitted a request to the Ministry of Education in our country to extend the investigation period by two months, for a total of six months. Later, we were fortunate to succeed in both aspects. Once the plan was finalized, our group left Geneva for Poland on September 1st and arrived on September 3rd. On the same day, Dr. Huaszek, Director of Supervision Rauboziński, and Dr. Qu Heng, representing the Polish Ministry of Education, discussed with our group the pre-prepared visit plan. After careful discussion, we generally considered it appropriate and began the investigation on September 6th. In addition to visiting Warsaw, the capital of Poland, for several days, we also visited Bygdoszcz, Gdynia, Krakow, Katowice, Chorzów, and several villages in the remaining twenty days. Generally speaking, we have gained a rough understanding of the education in western, southern, and northwestern Poland. On October 1st, we transferred to Berlin and discussed the schedule for the investigation in Germany with representatives from Berkell, Hecker, Liddman, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Prussian Ministry of Education. October 5th to 10th was the school holiday period in Germany. Our group took advantage of this leisure period to go to Denmark for investigation. We arrived in Copenhagen on the same day, and the next day we discussed the schedule with the Danish Ministry of Education. The ministry sent Dr. Jensen to accompany us to visit various places every day. For a total of one week, we gained a rough understanding of urban and rural education. Then, according to the determined schedule, we returned to Lübeck in Germany on October 11th. Dr. Hecker came to greet us and immediately acted as our translator. Our group then went from Lübeck to Hamburg, then to Düsseldorf, then to Cologne, then to Essen, then to Stuttgart, then to Frankfurt, then to Munich, and then to Dresden, visiting dozens of cities and countless villages before returning to Berlin. This was because Germany's educational achievements have long been famous in the world, and Germany does not have a unified school system, with each state governing itself and having its own strengths, so we had to spend more time and energy. The day after completing the investigation in Germany, we rushed to France. We met with Professor Langevin, Dr. Barriere, a representative of the Ministry of Education, the Dean of the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris, and other famous figures in the education field, and discussed the schedule for the investigation in France. The investigation period was one month, divided into visits to the four university districts of Paris, Nancy, Lyon, and Strasbourg, and their rural areas, with each place ranging from two or three days to more than ten days. After completing the investigation in France, our group went to the United Kingdom. In London, Dr. Ball, an employee of the British International Institute of Intellectual Co-operation, Dr. Wood, a representative of the Ministry of Education, and others took care of everything. For the first few days, we mostly held meetings with the Ministry of Education and famous figures in the education field to discuss the system and ideological issues of British education. Then we went to Oxford University, Cambridge University, Reading University, Leeds and other places, investigating each place for several days before returning to London to investigate the education of the City of London until the end of December, when we finally concluded. Our group had to leave the United Kingdom and go to Italy again, as the investigation schedule in Italy started on January 5th. On January 5th, our colleagues arrived in Geneva, Italy. Professor Pompianri, a representative of the Italian government, came to greet us. The next day, we began the investigation there. We spent only one day before going to Milan for three days, then to Rome, from Rome to Naples, then to Pompeii, and then back to Rome before going to Florence, then to Bologna, and then to Venice. The investigation in Italy ended here. On January 21st, we arrived in Vienna, the capital of Austria. We spent several days discussing Austrian education in the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Education Bureau, and other places. Afterwards, for more than a week, we devoted ourselves to visiting various schools and educational institutions, both in cities and villages, taking care of both sides. On February 3rd, we left Austria and entered Russia, arriving in Moscow on the 5th. Employees of the Chinese-Soviet Conference Delegation in our country and representatives of the Soviet Russian government came to take care of everything. That afternoon, we discussed the visit procedure and began the next day, completing it in ten days. The European investigation work of our group came to an end here. This is a rough outline of the investigation trips to various places. As for the content of the investigation, it was very extensive, from kindergartens to universities, from the central education administration to the education administration of the smallest local units, from classroom teaching to film education and sound education, we stopped at each one. Therefore, the investigation schedule was particularly busy. We started visiting at eight or nine o'clock in the morning and did not finish until six or seven o'clock in the afternoon. The only time for organizing notes was at night. However, the governments of various countries often took advantage of this time to invite us to the national theater to watch plays, and on Sundays, we often went to the countryside to visit teachers' sanatoriums, local education conferences, student field trips, and other activities related to education. Therefore, in these few months, all the members of our group felt that time was not enough, and foreign friends were all worried that our group's working hours were too long. However, we ourselves felt that as weak individuals, we were responsible for this important task of investigation, and we had to make up for our shortcomings with diligence (to be continued).</p>
<h3>Highly Treated in Europe</h3>
<p>Q: How was the reception in various countries? A: Before our group set off, the International Institute of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations had already contacted the governments of the countries concerned, so all countries were prepared in advance, and therefore the reception was extremely considerate. Whenever we arrived in a country, government representatives would personally come to the station to pick us up. For example, the Vice Minister of Education and the Director of the Department of Foreign Affairs came to the station to welcome us. When we arrived in Italy, the Italian government specially sent the Vice Minister of Education to Milan to welcome us. When we arrived in Germany, in addition to government representatives, former Minister of Education Dr. Berkell also came to the station in person. The situation in France was also roughly the same. All countries invited us in the name of the government. Whenever we arrived in a city, the mayor, the director of the Municipal Education Bureau, either came to greet us in person or sent people to receive us, all doing their best to show the hospitality of the host, inviting us to meals, watching plays, or specially holding concerts, which became a common practice everywhere. Whenever we arrived at a school, the principals and teachers were extremely happy, inviting us to stay for meals, sign our names, send student grades, and take commemorative photos, which was almost the case everywhere. The governments of various countries, as well as various schools and educational institutions, provided as much educational material as possible, which was of great help to our colleagues' reference. This was because this was the first time that the Chinese government had officially dispatched an education survey group, and the governments and schools of various countries were willing to cooperate with the Chinese education community, which represented the high-level culture and history of the East, in order to communicate Chinese and Western cultures and promote the progress of mankind. Under this noble mentality of the governments and education communities of various countries, our colleagues were treated favorably everywhere.</p>
<h3>Handling of Materials</h3>
<p>Q: What is the nature of the reference materials obtained, and how will they be handled? A: The materials obtained this time are very numerous. Most of them were donated by the governments and educational institutions of various countries, and a small part were purchased by our group. All of them were packed in wooden boxes and sent back after the investigation of each country was completed. Each country had at least one large box, and some had as many as three or four wooden boxes. The nature of the materials is: (1) education laws and regulations, (2) education books and newspapers, (3) student grades, (4) other items related to education. These materials can be of great reference value to the education community. While we were in Europe, we discussed the handling of these materials and planned to organize an exhibition or display them in the library of the Ministry of Education after they were sorted out, so that people in the education community could easily refer to them. How to handle them in the future will naturally have to be decided by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Advantages of European Education</h3>
<p>Q: What are your impressions of European education? A: Our group will definitely publish an investigation report in the future. The situation of European education and its contributions to the construction of Chinese education will be described in detail in the report. At this time, the investigation has just ended, and we have not yet been able to sort it out. Without the resolution of the group as a whole, it is difficult to express formal opinions. However, after several months of investigation, I have many personal observations, so I might as well tell you some of the important ones from my personal perspective.</p>
<h3>Education is Increasingly Valued</h3>
<p>(1) European countries recognize the importance of education more keenly than before, and unanimously regard education as the most fundamental and most effective tool for improving individuals, society, and the country. Therefore, individuals, society, and the country are also unanimously striving to engage in education. The financial difficulties of individuals and countries in various countries are more severe than before the war. However, the number of students in schools at all levels is higher than before, and the amount of education funding undertaken by governments at all levels is also higher than before. The construction and equipment of schools are better than before. All of this is sufficient to prove that various countries recognize education and strive for education.</p>
<h3>Efforts in Universal Education</h3>
<p>(2) The emphasis on universal education. In the past, we have heard people say that European education is class education, and the poor and lowly classes cannot enjoy it, the reasons being (1) high tuition fees, (2) complex school system. In fact, European countries are currently paying attention to the education of all people. Compulsory education not only has no tuition fees, but also provides school supplies. Many countries not only provide good kindergartens for young children, but also provide meals and clothing without any fees. Kindergarten education in Europe is a relief business for poor families. As for education above elementary school, those belonging to vocational crafts are charged very low fees, and poor children can easily enter school. Other restrictions are not strict. Those belonging to ordinary secondary schools have higher tuition fees and very strict selection, but the government has set up free places. All poor but intelligent and hardworking children do not have to worry about not being able to enter school. There are also some popular education institutions in society that are sufficient to increase the knowledge and skills of the general public. Those who are determined to study can make good use of them. Therefore, in reality, everyone has the opportunity to study. As for the school systems of European countries, they are indeed complex, but the difficulty of mutual conversion between schools is not as great as it was once rumored. Therefore, European education is also the education of all people.</p>
<h3>Extremely Good Academic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Third, the academic atmosphere is good. In any country in Europe, from middle school to university, we have not heard of students causing disturbances, we have not heard of students making suggestions and forcing schools to adopt them, we have not heard of students disobeying school orders, and there is absolutely no such thing as self-selecting principals or expelling education. Even in the Soviet Union, there is absolutely no such fact. The student self-government association in Soviet secondary schools has strong guidance from school teachers, and students must obey. Generally speaking, Europeans believe that autonomy and obedience are indeed essential elements for building a sound country and society. Students must receive this kind of training at school before they can become good citizens. As for the supervision of school education, the responsibility lies with the government, and the government's supervision lies with the parliament and the citizens. Young students are not allowed to abandon their studies and overstep their authority. Because of the good academic atmosphere in various schools, students can study with peace of mind and achieve good results. The education industry is not only on the right track, but has never been derailed.</p>
<h3>Strict Screening of Teachers</h3>
<p>Fourth, the teachers are excellent. Teachers in primary and secondary schools in European countries generally have longer training periods than in China, and they are very serious, and they have to pass strict examinations before they can enter school and graduate. After graduation, they must go through a considerable period of internship before they can become formal teachers, so their teachers are indeed better than those in China. Once formally appointed, they are in permanent service. Any principal or head of education cannot easily dismiss them unless there are special and serious faults. The salary of teachers, whether in middle school or elementary school, is sufficient for the use of a family, so they can work with peace of mind because they have no worries about their family. We often see teachers in primary and secondary schools who have served in a school for thirty years with gray hair and old age. This is the reason.</p>
<h3>Emphasis on Practical Education</h3>
<p>Fifth, emphasis on practical science and physical education. In the past, we have also heard that European education is too biased towards culture, with too much Latin and Greek in middle schools and too little applied science. This view is also only knowing one thing. European elementary schools are the basic education for life, and naturally take the knowledge and skills necessary for life as the main thing. Above middle school, there are two types of schools, one is ordinary middle schools, which mainly prepare for university, and the other is vocational schools such as agriculture, industry, commerce, home economics, and politics. These schools completely focus on applied sciences. The curriculum of ordinary middle schools still retains Latin and Greek, and some have abandoned them. Even in the United Kingdom, which pays attention to Latin and Greek public middle schools, they now also pay attention to handicraft (woodworking and metalworking) and science. In Russia, the trend of focusing on science and handicraft is greater than in any other country. Latin and Greek are no longer seen in the curriculum. Any student has to enter the metalworking and woodworking shops, and those who cannot work are not allowed to be students. Because Soviet Russia is striving to complete its industrialization within ten years, and the citizens it needs are citizens who can work, its education has to pay special attention to applied science and handicraft. The handicraft achievements of other countries are admirable. Senior elementary schools and middle schools all have metalworking and woodworking shops, and the equipment of their shops is almost the same as that of formally trained workers. Therefore, the students' achievements are very good, and they can manufacture the instruments and specimens used in scientific teaching themselves. According to the explanations of the school authorities, the country is currently facing economic difficulties, and the school funds are insufficient, so they cannot purchase various instruments as they used to, and they have no choice but to train students to manufacture them themselves, which costs only 20-30% of the purchase price.</p>
<h3>Promote Military Training</h3>
<p>In addition, all schools pay more attention to physical education than before the war, and their exercises are very different from the soft exercises we practice in our country. Even sports such as basketball, football, and baseball, which cost a little more, are not commonly used by various schools. The most widely promoted ones are various games of rural children in our country, as well as the methods of running, kneeling, crawling, and walking. Swimming is highly valued. Long-distance outdoor travel is also vigorously promoted in Germany and Poland. This kind of physical education method is more practical, cost-effective, and effective. The emphasis on science, handicraft, and physical education not only has profound significance in education, but also has important relations in social life and national defense. Therefore, in later social life, there is a trend that those who cannot work cannot live. Applied science is more closely related to general life than other academic disciplines, so education has to attach importance to it. Moreover, the undercurrents in the world today are more severe than before the war. All countries not only pay attention to military preparations, but also to the preparation of soldiers. The physical education that is currently popular is actually the most effective military training. Handicraft is also an essential skill for soldiers, because soldiers must not only be able to use weapons, but also be able to build fortifications and make the simplest repairs to military equipment. School education, social life, and national defense must be linked together, which is an urgent task for China. I hope the government and compatriots will pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Report Will Be Drafted Soon</h3>
<p>The above is just a simple explanation of the most important points. After all the members of our group return to China, we will immediately start drafting the report and ask the people of the country to correct us. The abilities of our colleagues are weak, the scope of education is too broad, and the time is too short, so the results obtained may not only fail to satisfy the hopes of the government and the people of the country, but also fail to satisfy the wishes of our colleagues themselves. However, our group has established considerable relationships and deep feelings with the governments and education communities of the countries we have visited. If we can continue to contact them, the benefits to each other will naturally be many. We especially hope that in the future, experts will continue to go to various countries to conduct more detailed and specialized investigations, and the colleagues of our group will do their best to fulfill the responsibility of liaison and introduction, so the results will be even more significant (End).</p>
<h3>The Rumor That Peking University Will Move to Henan is Untrue</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang University is Ready to Hand Over at Any Time</h3>
<p>Since Principal Cheng left the school, the school affairs of Zhejiang University have been maintained by Secretary-General Shen Lu. In the past month, the teachers and students have been quite quiet and orderly. Although the school's finances are extremely difficult, after Secretary-General Shen asked the Provincial Government Finance Department to allocate 10,000 yuan to the school on a monthly basis, it can also be maintained with difficulty. In the past week, all departments and sections of the Secretariat and the three faculties and factories have started to prepare the transfer list. It is reported that by Tuesday of this week, all kinds of transfer lists have been prepared. The Ministry of Education has announced that Guo Renyuan will be the president of the school. After hearing the news, the school authorities have stopped handling all matters and are waiting for the handover at any time.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Principals, Teachers and Staff in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Principals will meet in Zhenjiang on the 14th of this month</p>
<p>Teachers and staff will meet in Xuzhou in this month</p>
<p>The principals of Jiangsu Provincial Secondary Schools will hold a meeting in Zhenjiang Middle School on the 14th to discuss funding and other issues.</p>
<p>In addition, the 12th Representative Congress of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Teachers and Staff of Secondary Schools should be held within one month after the start of the school year, according to regulations. However, there is no suitable holiday time that can be used, and the location of the meeting was decided by the previous congress to be in Xuzhou, which takes time to travel to and from. Wu Dezhang, chairman of the executive committee of the federation, sent a letter to all executive committee members to solicit their opinions on whether the meeting could be held during the spring break when all schools are closed for the Qingming Festival. It is reported that the executive committee members believe that most of the teachers and staff return to their hometowns to worship their ancestors and sweep tombs during the spring break, making it difficult to convene the meeting. It is still more convenient to hold the meeting before the spring break, probably in March. The location of the meeting will still be in Xuzhou, according to the decision of the congress.</p>

<h3>International Basketball Finals Tonight</h3>
<p>Women's Group: China vs. Britain for the Championship, 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Men's Group: First Final between China and the United States, 8:30 PM</p>
<p>U.S. Women vs. Federation, 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Losing the men's and women's championships for two years, we hope Chinese athletes will work hard.</p>
<p>This year's International Basketball Championship has reached the decisive stage. The men's and women's championships can be decided, at least in part, tonight. There are a total of three games. The schedule is as follows. Tickets are all one dollar.</p>
<p>Teams Playing, Group, Time, Referee</p>
<p>(1) U.S. vs. Federation (Women), 6:30 PM, Zhou Jiaqi</p>
<p>(2) China vs. Britain (Women), 7:30 PM, Touren</p>
<p>(3) First Final between China and the United States (Men), 8:30 PM, Hall</p>
<p>Li Zuqi</p>
<h3>First Game</h3>
<p>U.S. Women's Team vs. Federation. The U.S. team is likely to win. The U.S. team will be represented by the strong players from the American Public. According to the U.S. team leader, the women's team was assembled temporarily due to a misunderstanding and suffered a crushing defeat in the first game against China. However, they firmly believe that Britain will beat China and that the U.S. can beat Britain, so the U.S. still has hope. The Federation will likely succumb tonight. In the Navy YMCA Women's Basketball Championship, the American Public defeated the Green Team 31-28 on Thursday night. The Green Team is the representative team of England.</p>
<h3>Second Game</h3>
<p>The game between China and Britain has the nature of a final. China has already won two games, and Britain has beaten the Federation. If China wins against Britain, they will win the championship. Based on the performance of the previous two games, China has a great chance of winning. However, the Green Team, the representative team of England, is tall. Special attention must be paid to the defense. Fast and perfect teamwork must be used to counter them. If forward Pan Yueying's foot injury improves, there is great hope. Since the establishment of the women's championship in the International Basketball Tournament, it has been won by the English women. We hope that all the Chinese female players will work together to win back the silver cup and make the Chinese women proud.</p>
<h3>Third Game</h3>
<p>Chinese and American men's teams will meet for the first time in the final. The second game is scheduled for next Wednesday. The Chinese lineup will be based on the five tigers of Hujiang, plus one or two other great players such as Kong Guangyi. The U.S. team will be based on the Western Youth, supplemented by the fierce player Mai Ling. Although the U.S. team is strong, China also has hope. The International Basketball Championship has been held by the United States for two years. We hope that the Chinese athletes will work hard to win it back this year.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan University Basketball Opens</h3>
<p>Three Games Today</p>
<p>Guanghua vs. Jinnan Postponed</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Sports Association's basketball championship games open this afternoon. There were originally four games scheduled for today, but due to continuous spring rain, any venue without an indoor court, only an outdoor court, will be very wet.

<h3>Philco Radio's Rapid Business Growth</h3>
<p>Philco Radio Corporation was established not long ago, but its business is thriving, and few can compare with it. In 1928, the radio industry in the United States was already very developed, with numerous factories everywhere, many of which already enjoyed great fame. Philco Radio Corporation was established in this year of the most intense competition in the industry. That year, the United States produced a total of four million radios, worth 700 million gold dollars, and Philco Radio sold 100,000 units, worth about 7.5 million gold dollars, accounting for about 2.5% of the national business.</p>
<p>In 1929, Philco Radio Corporation was the first to invent the automatic volume control and improved its sales methods, so it was able to sell 500,000 units out of the total national sales of five million units, accounting for about 10% of the national business.</p>
<p>In 1930, the third year after the founding of Philco Radio Corporation, the national output was four million units, each worth 125 yuan, totaling 500 million gold dollars. Philco sold 800,000 units, accounting for almost one-fifth of the national radio business.</p>
<p>In 1931, the American business market was sluggish, and many factories closed down, but Philco's output increased to one million units, worth 86 million gold dollars, accounting for one-third of the US industry. In the second half of the year, it accounted for 40% of the industry. Last year, the company's business was even more prosperous, expanding its capital and adding equipment. It is said that it can now produce 12,500 radios per day. Now, it is also engaged in the improvement of television technology (i.e., video receivers) and other radio-related inventions, striving for perfection.</p>
<p>The company has a branch in China, with offices and showrooms at 96 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, telephone number 17930. All are welcome to visit and listen. (The company also manages Philco brand batteries, etc.)</p>
<h3>Features of the Latest Style Stewart 106 Radio</h3>
<p>— Zhenzhi</p>
<p>The Stewart 106 radio has six features:</p>
<p>(1) Suppression of noise between stations.</p>
<p>(2) [Q] Circuit.</p>
<p>(3) Delayed automatic volume control.</p>
<p>(4) Using the latest type 59 power vacuum tube to reduce humming and increase power to 2/10ths of the PZ pentode vacuum tube.</p>
<p>(5) Expanding the harmonic range to enable reception of the latest frequency of 540 kilocycles.</p>
<p>(6) Equipped with the latest powerful power transformer to prevent any possibility of burnout.</p>
<p>The above three features (1), (2), and (3) are important for the reception of any radio, so these features are bound to become the standard of the radio industry in the future. All radio enthusiasts need to understand the role of these features. This will not only enable you to master this new radio and get satisfactory results, but also give you the basic knowledge to choose a good radio. These features are described below:</p>
<p>Noise Suppression Between Stations</p>
<p>One of the shortcomings of automatic volume control is that noise often occurs when tuning between two stations. This shortcoming is corrected in the 106 model by the presence of inter-station noise suppression and Q circuit.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of inter-station noise suppression is to limit man-made or atmospheric noise between two stations. Please note the meaning of [between two stations]. There is currently no radio circuit that can isolate noise and audio signals that have been received by the antenna. So when you talk about noise suppression between two stations, please do not forget this fact.</p>
<p>The effect of inter-station noise suppression can be explained as follows. Suppose there are many broadcast stations in the air, and the sound of the signals they emit has various intensities for a certain area. If you draw many vertical lines with their heights representing the intensity of each incoming signal, you get the shape shown in Figure 1. ABCDEF are six</p>
<p>stations, each station has different signal strength. When the listener turns the tuning dial, these signals are successively tuned in. Suppose that at this particular time, the atmospheric noise in the air can be represented by a straight line at the height of station C. This means that the atmospheric noise entering at this time has the same loudness as the audio signal emitted by station C. Because atmospheric noise exists uniformly at all points on the tuning dial, we can naturally use a horizontal line H with a height of C to represent it. The programs transmitted from stations ABDF are often mixed with atmospheric noise equal to H. However, this noise is extremely small compared to the total volume of stations ABDF, so it can be masked by them. However, listening to the sounds of stations AB can receive a lot of noise. In addition, there is an extremely difficult problem to solve, that is, when the radio is tuned between stations CE, its automatic volume control automatically raises the machine's selectivity to the highest level, and then all the atmospheric noise is brought in until station B is reached. This noise is extremely unpleasant when tuning.</p>
<p>If we give this radio a variable selectivity control, we can reduce its maximum selectivity to a certain value, set it to the horizontal line K. In this way, this machine will no longer be able to receive the weak stations CE or the atmospheric noise H. Therefore, when tuning between AB, BD, or DF, the noise received must be very small, or even completely absent. Therefore, this selectivity control can be regarded as a kind of inter-station noise suppression. However, we must remember that in order to weaken the selectivity, the volume of all stations must also be reduced accordingly. But this reduction in volume can be adjusted by improving the volume control.</p>
<p>Because the level of atmospheric noise will vary depending on the area and reception conditions, this inter-station noise suppression is made into a variable control, so that its selectivity is also reduced until the atmospheric noise is no longer received at that time. However, we must still remember that after the radio's selectivity is weakened, it cannot tune in the sounds of weaker stations, and the sounds of the stations that can be received must be accompanied by the same proportion of atmospheric noise. It is useless to reduce the overall volume. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Good News in the Radio World</h3>
<p>The Yada Company, located at 25 Renji Road in this city, has noted that the number of people in Shanghai who own radios is increasing daily, but when the machines are damaged, there are no complete repair shops to obtain satisfactory repairs. In view of this, the company has specially set up a repair department, hiring Xu Zhifang, a radio engineer from the former Kailuo Company and Wheeler Company, to take charge of repairing various radios and all accessories for all walks of life. It is heard that the machine parts repaired by the company are done quickly, the prices are low, and after the repairs, a warranty is issued, so that all walks of life are extremely satisfied.</p>
<h3>Achievements of Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Dan</p>
<p>1932 was the most progressive and active year for the Marconi Company. We only need to examine the status of the company's important parts to know how important the research on radio and the increase and development of the application of radio in land, sea, and air have been in the past year. 1. Radio Research and its General Development Status</p>
<p>Among the entire radio industry, the most outstanding in 1932 and full of possibilities for realization in the future is the application of [microwaves] with wavelengths shorter than one meter, which Marconi declared and is theoretically considered to be able to reach very far distances.</p>
<p>Marconi and his assistants have sacrificed a lot of time to study the application of these extremely short waves. They have conducted experimental transmissions over a distance of more than 168 kilometers between Rogodi in the vicinity of Rome and Fagliari, Sardinia. As a result, it is clear that these extremely short sound waves can avoid the various obstacles caused by the curvature of the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>Secondly, what attracted the attention of experts and the general public around the world was the Marconi engineers' research on wireless television over the past two years. Last August, the Marconi Company in Chamesford used wireless radio to transmit television news between Britain and St. Peter's College in York, printing news messages on a moving tape for broadcasting at a speed of 120 words per minute. Receivers could easily read it on a glass plate on a teletype machine.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be seen that the Marconi Company has completed its particularly reliable wireless television work. It is said that they will continue to develop this issue to be used commercially and for entertainment, i.e., used in radio broadcasting, homes, open-air stages, and theaters.</p>
<p>In general, radio science has made great progress in recent years. That is, the number and power of radio stations have increased, and the methods of managing radio waves have become increasingly thorough. In terms of reception, the sound selection methods of radios have also greatly improved. Therefore, there are renewed requirements for calculators, such as electromagnetic field strength calculators needed to improve practicality, and accurate and portable signal strength indicators. The Marconi Company has also successfully researched and achieved them. They have been very effective in various electromagnetic calculations and have also created many machines that are extremely useful for the development of power stations in the future.</p>
<p>The new short-wave reflector antenna has been tested at the Summerton radio station and has achieved very good results. This new type of antenna is easy to set up, occupies less space than the ordinary antenna used by the Balkoni radio station, and can obtain the same concentration of radio waves.</p>
<p>In terms of sound reception, sensitive commercial radios have been well developed and have been adopted by the Badak Post Office. These advanced short-wave radios used to receive reflected radio waves have been improved, the most important point being the invention of echo prevention.</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>What is Expected of Broadcasting Stations</h3>
<p>— Zhenzhi</p>
<p>I think radio broadcasting stations have at least two missions: one is to transmit news, and the other is to promote culture. For the former, there is nothing more to improve besides making the news timely and accurate. However, for the latter, there are many points for improvement. I will briefly mention one or two points based on my personal views for selection.</p>
<p>First, China has been promoting Mandarin education for more than ten years, but there have been no significant achievements so far. The reason is nothing more than listening and speaking less. The role of the Mandarin phonetic symbols is only to enable people to pronounce accurately, but not to enable people to speak fluently. Therefore, although every elementary school teacher can understand the pronunciation of each word, the result is that they still cannot speak fluent Mandarin. If what the teachers speak is not fluent, then what the students learn is of course conceivable. If this continues, I don't know when Mandarin will be popularized throughout the country. I think radio is a powerful tool for promoting Mandarin education. Every broadcasting station should take on the responsibility of popularizing Mandarin. In addition to academic lectures and other programs, all other programs such as current affairs reports, advertisements, and introductions to each program must be broadcast in Mandarin. It would be even better if more Mandarin programs could be set up specifically.</p>
<p>Second, in order to promote the education of the common people, I hope that major broadcasting stations will reduce programs of low taste as much as possible and increase various popular lecture programs, and send the daily lecture topics to various newspapers for collection and disclosure, so that listeners can freely choose the topics they are concerned about and interested in.</p>
<p>Third, Japan, Europe, and the United States have recently popularized a kind of radio literature, which incorporates various meaningful novels, stories, science, etc. into interesting dialogues, similar to China's [next-door drama]. We can imitate this method, or entrust someone to translate it, or hire someone to create it. I think that as long as each broadcasting station expresses a need, the manuscripts will definitely come in droves. However, this kind of broadcasting talent needs special training. If the people from the performing arts troupes are still called in to broadcast, the result will definitely be like the transformation of vernacular drama into civilization drama.</p>
<h3>China Needs Radio (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Youxiong</p>
<p>Radio is divided into two types: communication and broadcasting. Communication is used to report news to distant places by means of codes. In our country, where wired telegraph equipment is not yet widespread, it can be used to make up for the lack, which is undoubtedly beneficial. The effects of broadcast radio mainly have three aspects: education, entertainment, and reporting. These three are all indispensable to human life. In today's world, people of all ages must have</p>
<h3>Radio Common Sense (2)</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>(2) What is a Radio Wave?</p>
<p>Since radio does not rely on electric wires for transmission, then what exactly is it? I can offer an analogy here. Please try throwing a stone into a pond and observe what happens. The moment the stone hits the water, the surface is disturbed, and waves arise, spreading outwards in circles. Gradually, the wavefronts become lower and lower, until everything is completely calm again. If a floating piece of wood is placed within the area where the waves are occurring, the wood will be agitated and will move up and down. Consider that the stone and the wood are not connected by any rope. The relationship between them is entirely dependent on the waves for transmission. Radio is the same, relying on radio waves for transmission. However, water waves are visible, while radio waves are invisible. The generation of water waves originates from the movement of the stone, while the generation of radio waves originates from the movement of electricity. The medium for transmitting water waves is water, while the medium for transmitting radio waves is the invisible [Ether] (Ether). What the ether is remains unclear to this day, but scholars, for the sake of convenient explanation, assume that this ether permeates the universe, just as the atmosphere permeates the Earth.</p>
<p>If we carefully observe the occurrence of water waves, we see that they have crests and troughs. One crest and one trough together make up one cycle. Similarly, one crest and one trough of a radio wave are also called one cycle (Cycle). The length of a water wave cycle is called the wavelength (WaveLength). Radio waves are also the same. The frequency of water waves depends on the manner in which the stone is thrown, and the frequency of radio waves also depends on the speed of electrical oscillation. Denser water waves have shorter wavelengths, while sparser waves have longer wavelengths. Faster electrical oscillation generates shorter wavelengths, while slower oscillation generates longer wavelengths. However, because the speed of radio wave propagation is the same as that of light, approximately 300,000,000 meters per second (i.e., 300,000 kilometers), knowing the number of cycles per second (i.e., frequency) allows one to determine the wavelength. This is because one only needs to divide the distance of 300,000,000 meters by the frequency. (In the diagram above, ABCDE represents one cycle. From A to E, or from B to F, and H to K, all represent wavelengths.)</p>
<p>Each radio station emits radio waves with different wavelengths, which means their frequencies are different. Radio waves are generally classified into the following types. Most of the waves used by broadcasting stations nowadays are medium waves, ranging from 200 meters to 3000 meters. Next, we will discuss what electric current is, how radio waves are emitted, and how radio waves can be received.</p>

<p>Rich general knowledge. This kind of knowledge can be found in books and textbooks in childhood. For intellectuals, it can be found in news magazines, which is not difficult. However, farmers in the interior who have not received education and laborers who work hard all day do not have this time. Second, for entertainment, the hard-working masses are busy all day long. If there is no entertainment to comfort them, they will lose the joy of life. Although people in the metropolis have many leisure activities such as movies and dramas, it is not a concern. However, farmers and workers in the countryside cannot do without radio. Third, for reporting. The Chinese people have always been less informed about national affairs. They regard the rise and fall of the country as not their concern. However, it is not that they really do not want to hear about it, but that there is no way to know. Now, if radio is used to report to the public at all times, so that the people can understand the general situation at home and abroad and develop their ability to participate in politics, then the benefits to the future of the country will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>In addition, radio weather forecasts can enable farmers and fishermen to prepare for a rainy day. Academic lectures can provide scholars and literati with more opportunities to benefit. Radio exercises and the broadcast of sports news also convey the purpose of physical training, and the storytelling of literature and stories also has the effect of moral education. Morality, intellect, and physical education are all beneficial, which is what we should not ignore.</p>
<p>Radio is so important to the public. Therefore, all European and American countries are striving to use it. Our eastern neighbor Japan is even more eager to catch up, with more than a dozen large radio stations broadcasting various programs every morning and evening. Since the Manchurian Incident, there has been no day without political speeches to cover up its aggressive ambitions, and to completely unify the thoughts of the people of the whole country under the will of the warlords. This method of unifying national will is most convenient with radio.</p>
<p>In short, the benefits of radio are not only in communication, but also in being a great tool for public education. It is not only a tool for education, but also can achieve the effect of unifying national opinion. Now China has such a vast territory, such a low level of education, and such scattered thoughts of the people. This is the time to use radio. I hope the people of the country will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Radio Receivers in Nature</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The ability of certain animals to emit light, electricity, and odors are relatively common and easily detectable phenomena. There is also a less noticeable phenomenon, which is the emission of radio waves by certain animals.</p>
<p>We know that homing pigeons, when released from a distance, can fly back to their original location on their own. Bats have very weak eyesight, but they can prey on small insects at night. Furthermore, zoologists tell us that lemmings in the high mountains of Norway often leave their nests in groups and make long journeys when the cold season comes, and often proceed in straight lines towards a certain destination, just like old horses that know the way.</p>
<p>These mysterious phenomena have not been able to obtain accurate and satisfactory explanations. According to the French radio expert Lacassagne, certain animals do have the ability to emit and receive radio waves. The antennae of insects are just like the cat's whisker in a crystal radio, with the function of picking up electromagnetic waves. Moreover, most animals have a special organ in their inner ear, consisting of three semi-circular canals. It is said that this organ has the ability to indicate direction. When animals lose it, they are at a loss for direction, as if they are in a fog. Most interestingly, the above-mentioned canals contain a liquid substance that is extremely sensitive to magnetic force. We know that radio broadcasters can generate variable magnetic fields around them, so we can even say that the semi-circular canals are radio receivers capable of sensing this kind of magnetic force change!</p>
<p>According to this theory, the aforementioned mysterious phenomena can be explained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When a homing pigeon flies up, it generates electricity by friction between its body and the air, and then rises or falls, forming a variable capacitor between its body and the ground. When it reaches a certain balance, it flies horizontally. This natural capacitor is the link between the two locations.</p>
<p>(2) Bats can prey on insects at night by using certain electromagnetic waves emitted by the latter as targets.</p>
<p>(3) Lemmings can move towards a distant destination by using the radio waves emitted by fish there as targets.</p>
<p>Whether this hypothesis is reliable remains to be studied jointly by radio experts and biologists, or a practical answer can be obtained. I will record it here temporarily, just for the sake of providing topics for conversation after dinner.</p>
<h3>All Kinds of Antennas</h3>
<p>— Jin Yunqiao</p>
<p>(1) The Role of Antennas in Radio Receivers</p>
<p>The name antenna specifically refers to the overhead wire erected outdoors. With the progress of radio technology today, indoor antennas can be used near power stations or in radios with high-frequency amplification. (For radios using indoor antennas, the high-frequency amplification part should be stronger than those using outdoor antennas, and the number of stages must be increased appropriately, otherwise it will be difficult to obtain satisfactory results.) Or even those who abandon the indoor ones are also exempt from using them.</p>
<p>The Western word for antenna is Antenna, which translates to insect antennae. Its importance to radio receivers is evident. The music and language of the broadcasting station, after the work of the microphone and vacuum tubes, are released by the antenna in the form of high-frequency radio waves, and then transmitted through the ether in the air, reaching everywhere. The antenna of the receiving station absorbs these radio waves and transmits them into the radio. We only need to increase or decrease the inductance of the induction coil and the capacitance of the capacitor in the radio, adjust it to the same point as the wavelength of the broadcasting station, so that resonance occurs, and then through the detector, the high-frequency current is changed to low-frequency, and then into the earphones or amplifier, and it becomes sound waves. Since the antenna is composed of a wire of considerable length, it has electrical storage and inductance. Its interaction with the ground wire is like a large capacitor, with the air in the middle insulating it. According to the definition of capacitance, the closer the distance between two metal plates, the greater the capacitance, and the smaller the area, the smaller the capacitance, otherwise the opposite is true. Therefore, the higher the antenna, the smaller the capacitance, but the induced voltage is strengthened. The longer the antenna, the greater the capacitance. The adjustment and reception of radio waves mostly depends on the action of capacitance and inductance. The sensitivity of the radio depends on this. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Radio in the Countryside</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently opened a very important agricultural exhibition, the main purpose of which was to persuade farmers to install radios in their farms. He believes that with a radio nearby, farmers are like being in the city, and can use it to discuss the prices of their products with people in the city, and can also know how to improve the tools they use. He regards the radio as a kind of agricultural tool.</p>

<h3>An Economical AC Three-Tube Receiver</h3>
<p>— Ren Xinyu</p>
<p>In the current trend of radio receivers leaning towards AC power, I think many amateur researchers would like to make an AC receiver to play with. Because AC receivers are not only easy to manage and have low running costs, but also have better effectiveness; however, the device is more complicated and the value is slightly more expensive, so many researchers shy away from it. I recently made a three-tube receiver, although it only has one stage of detection and one stage of low-frequency amplification, the volume is very large, the selectivity is also good, and the value is very low. It is worth trying for general economic comrades. Now I will write down my experience for the reference of others. Vacuum tubes use two 227s and one 210A.</p>
<p>The circuit and parts are shown in the attached diagram.</p>
<p>The tuning coil uses a one-inch inner diameter spider web board, and is wound with 24-gauge wire for 63 turns, with one tap every nine turns. The regenerative coil is wound with the same gauge wire for 45 turns, and is installed on a push-pull frame for advancement and retreat.</p>
<p>The core of the power transformer is a one-inch square cross-sectional area. The primary uses 30-gauge wire for 1800 turns; to supply the filament current for two 227s, use two 16-gauge wires in parallel for 23 turns, with a center tap at 11 and a half turns; to supply 201, use 24-gauge wire for 45 turns, also with a center tap; the high-voltage coil uses 38-gauge wire for 1600 turns; wax paper must be used to separate each layer, and several layers of wax paper must be wound between the primary and each secondary. Choke coils can be made by connecting two old low-frequency square-frame secondaries in series, or use 30H products.</p>
<p>After the components are installed, if you feel that the selectivity is not satisfactory, you can reduce the capacity of the capacitor in the antenna circuit a little. Although the sound quality is reduced, the selectivity is increased a lot. The incoming wire of the power supply and the wiring of the filament machine must use stranded wire, otherwise there may be very large AC noise; it is better to put a purple copper soft sleeve on the outside and ground it, so that the AC noise is further reduced. The iron core of the power supply part must also be grounded to avoid mutual induction. After I listened to this radio for several days, I felt that the volume on the long wavelength side was very light, and I tried various methods to improve it, but they were all ineffective. Later, I added a coil to the antenna and ground wire, using a three-inch diameter for 50 turns, with one tap every five turns, one end connected to the antenna and one end connected to the ground wire. When connected in this way, not only the long wave aspect was much louder, but also the short aspect was much louder. However, after a few days, I felt that the sound quality was not good, especially the female voice was easily distorted. I accidentally thought of the importance of the bypass capacitor, so I added a 1MF capacitor between B+Det and B丨, and the sound quality was indeed improved a lot. I also added a high-frequency choke coil at X in the attached diagram. The manufacturing method is as follows: Prepare two bakelite boards, and file them into a circle, one inch in diameter, and then cut the bamboo sleeve of the brush, about three or four minutes in diameter, into three minutes long, clamp it in the middle of the two small round plates, and tighten it with screws, like the wheel of a rickshaw, and then use 38-gauge wire to wind about 1700 turns on the bamboo tube. Use another capacitor, one end connected to the choke coil and one end connected to the ground wire. In this way, I feel that the volume and selectivity have increased a bit. Now my improvement of this radio can be considered complete, and I will tell you more about it in the future. The materials for this radio, except for the vacuum tubes and copper wire, can all be bought from domestic goods, and wireless comrades may wish to try it.</p>

<h3>On the Subject of Slaves of a Conquered Nation</h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>With the loss of Rehe, the gentry and the like are said to be preparing to become slaves of a conquered nation. I think this is somewhat Quixotic.</p>
<p>Before Don Quixote's great battle with the windmill, he had treated the inn as a royal city, and the innkeeper as an emperor, and had been knighted. Now, there is actually a group of gentry who want to treat this autumn-leaf-like territory as their own country, and receive the [slave of a conquered nation] knighting by the Japanese clogs. That is truly a unique Don Quixote.</p>
<p>When the January 28th Incident broke out last year, I once heard a high-ranking military officer in Hankou say: Our current major problem is not the Japanese. We would rather let the Japanese occupy Hankou than let the XX army occupy it. In my opinion, this is indeed the truth. Of course, that high-ranking military officer has his own position. To put it bluntly, if Hankou is occupied by the Japanese, he can still be his military officer; isn't Zhang Haipeng a precedent? However, if XX army occupies it, what will happen? Obviously, he is in danger of having his head moved. His class consciousness is very correct.</p>
<p>But from another perspective, China no longer has something like a country, or at least China has to be put in parentheses. But since the Opium War, imperialism has already partially taken China as its own colony. The three northeastern provinces were not lost since the September 18th Incident, but had already been lost before the September 18th Incident. The demise of China will not start from today, but has already been lost to the hands of various imperialists. All rulers become rulers only after being knighted by various imperialists. Who can explain that the Battle of Rehe is a sign that our people are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation? Who can point out that this is not a civil war between various knighted Don Quixotes? Then, because of the loss of Rehe, the gentry and the like want to receive the knighting of a slave of a conquered nation, which is really a step behind. And in fact, the gentry and the like who have already worn [an old, rusty helmet passed down from their great-grandfather and left in the corner of the house for a long time] have no need to ask the clogs for a second knighting.</p>
<p>For the present plan, it is better for the gentry to still follow those figures like Tang Yulin and move to Rehe, or even Liaoning, to live. As for the adults and gentlemen who have high opinions and want to clean their houses, so that [small mice] do not jump on the beams, and welcome the dwarves, blue-eyed people, and straight-footed ghosts to have a [carving party] to their heart's content, that is just blindly learning the tricks of Don Quixote, treating windmills as giants; and the result is: [He shielded himself, carried a spear and horse, and chased the first windmill, stabbing the spear into the car shed. The windmill rolled the spear away with violent force. In an instant, the shaft of the spear was shattered. The knight and horse were thrown into the wilderness with the spear, turning around and falling to the ground.]</p>
<p>That's all. Then, at that time, it would be more appropriate for the gentry and the like to move back home and receive the knighting of a slave of a conquered nation from the windmills again.</p>
<h3>Lamenting Tang Yulin</h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>Rehe was finally [lost] again. According to a certain important person: [The loss of Rehe was expected,] 丨丨Naturally, everyone knows that this was [expected,] but now this [expected] has made our Chairman Tang Yulin a target of public criticism, and he has also been [removed from office and investigated] by a clear order.</p>
<p>If Tang Yulin's removal from office and investigation was before Rehe was [lost], and the reason for the removal from office and investigation was because he imposed exorbitant taxes in Rehe, because he forced the planting of opium in Rehe, because he manufactured and sold red pills, morphine, and heroin in Rehe, because he squeezed the bone marrow and devoured the blood in Rehe, harming the people to indulge in himself, we would inevitably applaud and applaud. However, this fact happened after Rehe was [lost], and the reason was not for the above-mentioned reasons, but because of the [expected] loss of Rehe, then, Tang Yulin's dismissal and investigation is unjust, and the matter is lamentable!</p>
<p>Why do we say that Tang Yulin's removal from office and investigation is [unjust]? Is the dismissal and investigation not because of his [non-resistance]? Is it not because of his [abandoning the city and fleeing]? But who should be responsible for the fall of the three northeastern provinces? Who should be responsible for the fall of Jinzhou and Yuguan? Our young marshal is still holding a large army and living in Beiping, dancing, listening to Peking opera, and playing golf, isn't he? Why should our Chairman Tang be dismissed and investigated?</p>
<p>However, to put it another way, our Chairman Tang is indeed [guilty]. His crime is not in [non-resistance] and [abandoning the city and fleeing], but in not being good at using [resistance strategies]. The facts of the past two years have not taught our Chairman Tang to be smart. In this regard, Tang Yulin is too stupid to live.</p>
<p>We plan for Chairman Tang. His final [resistance plan] should be like this:</p>
<p>First stage: (The Japanese army has the appearance of invading Rehe) Send a telegram to the whole country, expressing [determination to resist]: issue a statement, expressing [oath to defend the land to the death], be generous and passionate, so that the [people] of the whole country absolutely believe.</p>
<p>Second stage: (The Japanese army actually launches an attack) While negotiating, resist, that is, submit a [serious protest] to Japan, using hard words such as [all responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side] to [scare] the Japanese army. If the Japanese army is hard [scared] and does not retreat, then on the other hand, you have to put down the opium pipe, set up a battle, and show [resistance], even if a few people are sacrificed as a result, but in any case, it will never sacrifice your own name.</p>
<p>Third stage: (The Japanese army is getting closer and closer) In diplomacy, appeal to the League of Nations and Washington, requesting to uphold justice: in strategy, establish a new position, [lure the enemy deep], to annihilate them in one fell swoop; in propaganda, send a telegram to the whole country, reporting that our army has captured and killed a number of enemy rebels, and report what is lacking in the front, calling on the [people] to go to the national crisis together and donate generously.</p>
<p>Fourth stage: (Of course, the Japanese army is approaching again) Send a telegram to beg for help, send a telegram to [counterattack], and establish a new position to lure the enemy deeper.······</p>
<p>Fifth stage: (The war situation in the front is unclear) [Avoid major sacrifices] and retreat to the Xth line of defense.</p>
<p>Sixth stage: Bundle up your children and wealth, retreat to Beiping, and send a telegram to the whole country, [preparing for long-term resistance].</p>
<p>If we [resist] according to such a [resistance plan], wouldn't our Chairman Tang immediately become a [national hero]? And weren't the garlands of many [national heroes] made in this way? But he didn't do that, and he had to simply abandon the city and flee. Being so stupid, is it not his fault that he was dismissed from office?</p>
<p>However, Tang Yulin has already [escaped], and he has [escaped to an unknown location]. Then, reading an Tang Yulin who is of unknown whereabouts to bear the total account of this [expected event] is ultimately beneficial to everyone, otherwise who should this account be charged to?</p>
<h3>Swallows</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>It was when twilight hung from the treetops, and there was a layer of purple haze in the sky, faint, like a seasonal dream. I walked slowly, until I reached a small river, and, leaning against the railing, I stood still. A gentle breeze blew past; I knew it was the wind of early spring. Such a tender wind of memory, and carried on the wind were one or two distant tolls from the Catholic church. Atop the church, the white cross silently clasped its hands in prayer beneath the vast purple sky, like a sacred virgin in a white robe.</p>
<p>A beam of sunset leaked through the leaves of the old willow tree in front of me, shining on my hairline; my hair had been tousled by the wind. And I softly whistled a tune, smiling. Such a tranquil, joyful twilight!</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard soft murmurs, whispering to each other. I raised my head and saw two purple swallows standing among the leaves of the old willow tree, fluttering their wings lightly, whispering their secrets of the South.</p>
<p>I looked at this pair of swallows; I recognized them. They and Miss Ling existed together in my memory. Miss Ling had already quietly lain beneath a piece of marble in the International Cemetery, which was inscribed with, [The Grave of Beloved Daughter Ouyang Ling]. But they had returned. Three years ago, I often saw this pair of purple swallows too. It was also spring then, also such a gentle wind, also such a tranquil twilight, also such a sacred white cross, also such a distant toll of the Catholic church. Miss Ling and I strolled slowly along this asphalt road in the suburbs. In the fields there was the scent of wheat, the double sound of cuckoos, the scorched fragrance of pine resin, a peaceful sky, peaceful sunlight—in the peaceful sky, under the peaceful sunlight, ripe fruits would fall peacefully. We would sit on the grass, on stone docks, on fallen flowers, on tree roots, we would stop by the bridge railing, and I would also gently whistle a tune, smiling. The pair of swallows would then stand in the willow branches above our heads, murmuring to each other, and Miss Ling would murmur to me just like the swallows. She could speak the language of swallows, whispering to each other, and she understood the secrets of the South, because she said:</p>
<p>"I am also a daughter of the South!"</p>
<p>She also said that the South had many, many purple swallows, which would often stand by her window and tell her about the scenery of her hometown. She said that several times, when she woke up in the morning and went to open the window, baby swallows would flutter in, flutter onto her, shivering. She also said that besides swallows, the South also had red beans, a blue sea, a clear sky, white buildings, and orchards.</p>
<p>She was suffering from homesickness! I knew she would eventually return one day.</p>
<p>That summer, she really did return, along with a pair of purple swallows. Now the purple swallows have returned twice, but where is Miss Ling? Where is Miss Ling? It is spring again, such a lovely twilight! The moon has risen, above the willow tips, on the beaks of the purple swallows.</p>
<p>I thought it would rain tomorrow. Sure enough, in the middle of that night, a few sparse drops of fine rain floated in from outside the window, floating into my sorrow, floating into my dreams.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Black Girl Seeking a Goddess (24)</h3>
<p>— Written by George Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"There is no such goddess," said the image-maker. "There is no goddess but those that I make; and I have never made one called   ."</p>
<p>"She exists," said the black girl; "for the White Miss spoke of her reverently as the root of the female of the universe, which is incorporeal like number, and before the beginning, as God is before creation. It is not the sex of   ; it is from the female sex that the sex of    arises. The beginning must be something of this     from which we are made and to which we return when we return to earth. I used to puzzle when I was a little child over every number to find out how number one comes; because all the other numbers are only so many ones and so many ones; but what is one? I could not think. Now I know from    that one is increased by itself, not by marriage of male and female. When you have one you know why there is no beginning and end; because if you subtract one and one and one forever you never get to the beginning; and if you add one and one and one forever you never get to the end; and so you have found the eternal in number."</p>
<p>"The eternal alone is nothing," said the Arab. "What is the eternal to me if I cannot find the eternal truth?"</p>
<p>"The truth of number alone is eternal," said the black girl. "All other truths either pass away or become errors like the fancies of our childhood; but one and one are two, and one and ten are eleven, forever. Therefore there is something godlike in number."</p>
<p>"You cannot eat number, you cannot drink number," said the image-maker. "You cannot marry number."</p>
<p>"God will provide us with other things to eat and drink," said the black girl. "We can marry one another."</p>
<p>"Oh, you cannot even make a picture of it, let alone speak of it," said the image-maker.</p>
<p>"We Arabs can," said the Arab. "By this sign we shall conquer the world. See!" He stooped and wrote numbers in the sand.</p>
<p>"The priests say that God is the magic number of three in one and one in three," said the black girl.</p>
<p>"It is simple," said the Arab. "I am the son of my father and the father of my sons and with myself the three are one and the one is three. The nature of man is manifold: only God is One. He is Unity. He is, as you say, a thing increased by itself from itself. He is the heart of the void, the center of nothingness without which there can be no body. He is the number of the innumerable stars: the measure of the unmeasurable air!"</p>

<h3>The Gold Rush Continues</h3>
<p>The morning market was full of astonishing changes</p>
<p>The afternoon market settled into a dull state</p>
<p>8.2 taels strong, fluctuating up 6.7 taels</p>
<p>Although the gold market fell slightly in the morning, its rebound was extremely strong. Foreign telegrams showed that both near-term and long-term contracts rose. The near-term rose 4.375, and the long-term rose by half a penny. New York silver prices rose by 0.625, so the opening raw price was initially bid at 75 to 80 taels. The foreign exchange market also hardened accordingly. The initial bid price for near-term British exchange was 1 shilling 9.25 pence, and the US exchange was 33.125 yuan, easing to .375 and .1875. The opening price was 680 taels, then fell to 77.2 taels, and then rebounded strongly, mainly because the foreign exchange market tightened, with June US dollars difficult to settle at 34.5 yuan (75 in raw trading). Gold prices were pulled up to over 80 taels. Although there was a lot of maneuvering after this, the trend was very firm. The Dalian gang frantically bought Dalian contracts, and Japanese brokers stuffed Dalian contracts to advance shillings. Western merchants sold shillings to buy US dollars. Step by step, the foreign exchange market improved. In addition, retail investors covered their short positions and went long, so gold prices remained high. The market seemed dry, with major players advancing incessantly. June US dollars even traded at 33.625 yuan, with banks all accepting. HSBC's listed shilling exchange rate was reduced by .25, then jumped to outside the 700 taels mark, reaching 705.5 taels in a rush. Unfortunately, this good situation did not last long. Foreign telegrams reported that the US banking industry would extend its holiday again. Amidst this extended holiday announcement, cash exports were still prohibited. At this point, the gold market turned around, with many people selling off at high prices. A selling atmosphere permeated for a time, and prices plummeted by about 10 taels, retreating to 696.5 taels at the close. The afternoon was extremely flat, with sparse trading and a dull market. After the opening, prices rose due to a report of a 14-anna drop in Bombay, but still gradually, reaching 9.7 taels before stopping. There were still quite a few sellers. Although the foreign exchange market was flat, it was firm, gradually falling to 4.2 taels. Banks' appetite turned to acceptance, with shillings being particularly good, once reaching 701 taels. In the end, it was still flat. Bombay rebounded by 5 annas, then fell to 696.7 taels at the close. The trend seemed stable after the mid-day drop and rebound. There was a lot of hedging activity, selling US exchange to hedge term transfers. There were no transactions in spot transfers, with prices approximately the same. A record of today's market situation is provided below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 680 taels, down 10 taels from the previous close. Goods opened at 79.5 taels. The foreign exchange market initially bid for near-term British exchange at 1 shilling 9.25 pence, and US exchange at 33.125 yuan, then continued to harden, with shillings at .375 and US exchange at .1875. Yifa Yongfu sold, breaking through 80 taels. Zhifeng Yong also sold, falling to 7.2 taels. Macquarie bought June shillings at 6.875. Hengyu Shunli and others all advanced, rising to 9.5 taels, hesitating slightly, because June US dollars were difficult to settle at 34.5 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang and Tongfeng Heng both came to buy, penetrating to over 80 taels. Bingxing Hengyu also accepted, at over 3 taels. Zhifeng Yong and Xixing Yong advanced slightly, to about 4 taels. Dadecheng sold off, retreating by more than 2 taels. At this time, June US dollars had already traded at .375. Fuyu advanced to 5.8 taels. Tianfeng Yong sold contracts, at 3 taels, but was held back because Qingfa Yong advanced limit-priced contracts. Shengda came up and advanced slightly, then picked up to over 5 taels. Hengyu also bought. Huabi took June US dollars for .25. General retail shorts rushed to cover, and prices rose. By the time Huabi ate June at .125, Zhaofeng Chang advanced contracts, penetrating 90 taels. Zhongyang even bought the same month at 34 yuan. Chunyuan Yong advanced to 91 taels. Although it retreated to 89.5 taels, because Hongli still advanced, it rose to 2 taels. Yuankang Xiang bought even more, at 3.5 taels. Qianchang Xiang also accepted. Macquarie bought June US dollars at 3.875. Daxing Yong came up and bought, at 96 taels, while retail investors sold slightly, retreating to 4.5 taels. The foreign exchange market tightened even more. In June, HSBC bought at .75. Hengyu Qianchang Xiang Fuyu all bought, then penetrated the 700 taels mark, reaching 701.5 taels. Goods were sold off. Ruixing also sold, gradually falling to 95 taels. Huabi even bought June US dollars at .625. Fushun advanced contracts, and was still pulled back to 701 taels, hesitating slightly. Yuanmao Yong sold off, retreating to 6.5 taels. The banks were willing to issue June US dollars at 6.875. Zhaofeng Chang came up and bought. HSBC listed shillings with a .25 reduction. The buying parties were excited for a time. Zhaofeng Chang advanced again, even to over 700 taels, but because Zhongfu sold June US dollars at .75, it maneuvered for a while. Daxing Yong Hengyu Yuanmao Yong all advanced, to about 703 taels. Daxing Yong advanced again, then reached 705.5 taels in a rush. The situation changed again. Foreign telegrams said that US banks might not be able to open tomorrow, and would have to extend for several days. During this holiday period, the ban on cash exports would continue. The selling wind permeated. Hengyu Yuanmao Yong Yuansheng Yong all sold, breaking below 700 taels. Yifeng Yong Hongli sold even more. There were no opponents in the market, and prices fell by about 10 taels, falling to 696 taels. Citibank bought June US dollars at 6.875, then returned to 8.5 taels. Shengda sold slightly, then retreated to 696.5 taels at the close. Goods closed at 6 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 696 taels, initially maneuvering between 67 and 68 taels. Retail investors all raised prices, reaching 8.2 taels. Goods were sold off for hedging, retreating to 6.5 taels. Bombay telegraphed a drop of 14 annas. Hengyu Yuansheng Yong all bought bravely, and prices rose accordingly. Huabi Zhongfu and others all accepted June US dollars at 3.75 yuan. Qingfa Yong also came to buy, rising sharply to 9.7 taels. Shengda sold at 9 taels. Qianchang Xiang also sold off at under 8 taels. Shengda came to sell again. Retail investors pressed prices, falling to under 6 taels, to 5.5 taels.  ate June US dollars at 6.875. Hengyu Fuyu all came to buy, rising to 9 taels. Qingfa Yong suddenly came to sell. Zhongfu also stuffed June US dollars at .75, then fell to 6 taels. Before long, .75 in June, Xing  came to sell, and a selling wind arose, reaching 4.2 taels. Yuanmao Yong advanced, pulling up by more than 2 taels. Yuan  also bought, at 6 taels, maneuvering between 67 and 68 taels for a long time. But people's hearts were stable, delaying for a long time. Banks bought long-term shilling settlements quite vigorously, with June .25 buyers being quite brave, then gradually rising, once penetrating the 700 taels mark, reaching 701 taels, but there were still many sellers. Yuansheng Yong sold off, then broke within the 700 taels mark. Dadecheng also issued, falling to about 8 taels. Yuanmao Yong also  to 7.5 taels. HSBC bought June US exchange at .75, then rose by 1 tael, but still tended to  travel. Citibank ate shillings at .0625, then began to struggle, standing still for a long time. Bombay telegraphed a rise of 5 annas. Hengyu came to the market to sell off, gradually falling to under 7 taels, to 6.5 taels. Yuanxin Yong Yuanmao Yong and others all advanced, pulling to 7.4 taels. Zhi  Yong still came to sell, closing at 696.7 taels. Goods were auctioned at 700 taels, really because there were many who covered their short positions overnight after the market closed. Rui and others  bought slightly, and the market once traded at about 700 taels. The highest price during the day was 705.5 taels, and the lowest price was 677.2 taels, a fluctuation of 28.3 taels. As a result, it rose 6.7 taels compared to the previous close. The current month's  is 713 taels, April's 697 taels, last year's water compensation 712 taels. The afternoon was the same.</p>
<p>Transactions on the board were extremely active in the morning, and quiet again in the afternoon. In summary, Zhaofeng Chang Chunyuan Yong Yuankang Xiang Hongli Daxing Yong Fushun Fuyu Bingxing Qianchang Xiang and others all advanced. Qingfa Yong Dadecheng Tianfeng Yong Yuanmao Yong Hengyu Ruixing Shunli Yuanheng Zhifeng Yong Yuansheng Yong and others all issued. The Dalian gang and Guangdong gang rarely saw huge advances and issuances. As of the previous day, the amount of April contracts totaled 22,064 contracts, a decrease compared to the previous  .</p>
<p>The spot transfer market was similar to the previous day. Trading in the market was hesitant. Prices rose from 30 taels to 35 taels, but never obtained a suitable price. The trend of those with goods was still upward, while those seeking goods waited and watched due to the high prices. It was difficult for both buyers and sellers to find opponents in the market. The market situation was extremely unstable.</p>
<p>The same was true for swap transfers. Although the Central Bank had a saying of posting advances of 15 taels, it was not yet certain. Yuantai had scattered short positions, seeking long positions everywhere without success. Transfer prices generally required 15 to 20 taels from multiple parties. As of the previous day, 959 contracts remained for March.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Initially Loose, Then Tight</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange rose and fell even more</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was extremely loose at the beginning of yesterday, then gradually tightened. The Dalian gang frantically bought Dalian contracts, which were all stuffed by Japanese brokers. On the other hand, they transferred shillings. Foreign banks  shillings to advance US exchange, which is why it became increasingly tight. The morning opened because foreign telegrams showed that London large contracts rose in the near and far term, and New York silver prices also rose sharply by 0.625. The near-term bid price was 1 shilling 9.25 pence for British exchange and 33.125 yuan for US exchange. After the opening, it gradually eased. June US exchange traded at 34.75 yuan. HSBC listed shillings up half a penny. The gold market also opened slightly lower, then gradually turned around. June US dollars tightened from a price of 4.375 yuan to 3.625 yuan, and even became difficult to settle. Compared with the loosest time, there was a difference of more than 1 yuan. The tight situation can be imagined. However, due to foreign telegrams about the US banking industry extending the market suspension period and continuing the ban on gold exports, it became slightly firmer, but June US dollars at 6.875 were still wanted. The afternoon was extremely quiet, maneuvering by only .125. At the close, the near-term bid price was 1 shilling 9.0625 pence for British exchange and 32.375 yuan for US exchange, loosening by .0625 (shillings) and tightening by .25 (US dollars) compared to the previous close. HSBC Citibank Huabi and others bought US exchange. Youli Mitsui Zhengjin Sassoon all bought shillings. Bombay sold fiercely a lot. The bank's advances and issuances for the day are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Abolished Cent, Japanese Silver Dollar Swap Interest Also Opens</h3>
<p>丨Both the morning and afternoon markets are at 4 fen丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry ordered the abolition of the market price of foreign cents. The conversion rate of silver dollars to foreign dollars is 7 qian 1 fen 5 li. From now on, there is no need to do market prices between markets, nor is there any need for ups and downs. At the same time, a kind of foreign dollar swap was added, but it was opened in conjunction with silver swaps. Yesterday, both the morning and afternoon markets were at 4 fen. If the foreign dollar swap is 4 fen, the silver swap is also 4 fen. All transfers are no longer fixed. The amount of foreign exchange drafts made was 1.35 million in the morning market and 910,000 in the afternoon market. Most foreign silver was in short supply and was generally distributed and evened out by the Money Industry Public Treasury. There were no reports of banknotes in either market. The total amount of check transactions in both markets was 145,000. There were no reports of bank transactions. Banknote inflows and outflows exceeded 900,000. All foreign accounts' dealings and foreign dollar swaps were simultaneously cancelled, and foreign dollar swaps were only swapped, not lent. Yesterday, foreign dollar swap drafts were about 2 million, and silver dollar swap drafts were over 2 million. Money shops' foreign public bills were increasingly cleared from then on, exceeding 18 million yesterday, while silver public bills were cleared less, only exceeding 14 million. Foreign exchange head bills were cleared for over 3.5 million, and silver exchange head bills were cleared for over 2.5 million. Bank clearing was also done in both silver and foreign dollars. Yesterday, silver dollar clearing, including commercial clearing bills, was over 2.1 million, and foreign clearing bills exceeded 2.34 million. Various commodity exchange taxes totaled over 7 million, with 500,000 in warehouse entries and 300,000 in warehouse exits. Foreign dollar clearing, the Chinese and foreign sides were too tied up with procedures, so there was not enough time to investigate the exact amount. The amount of small money shops' transactions was over 1.8 million, and the amount of foreign collateral loans was over 1.5 million. The amount of silver collateral loans was not detailed. The currency market situation was as follows: Jiangnan small foreign dollars were priced at 6 qian 1 fen 7 li and a half in the morning market and the same price in the afternoon market. Transactions were 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Rose by .2 to .55</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange said that although rumors of war in Tianjin were heavy, there was no significant development. Market sentiment was still quite stable. The multiple parties had no flaws. Shorts gradually transferred their positions, and the Northern Gang turned to buying. The market price gradually rose in a curve. In the morning's first session, 21st issue bonds were in greater demand. Although 4th and 5th issue bonds were sold, they were only at a disproportionate force, and the market price rose by .3 to .4. However, salt tax bonds went down slightly by .1 or .2. The trend was from front to back, and the number of rises gradually differed. As a result, in the second session, the heavy sales of 38th and 50th issue bonds retreated slightly by .2 or .3, but salt tax bonds rose by .2 or .3 instead, as they had fallen slightly in the previous session. The trend was the opposite of the first session, seeming to maneuver, but because the number of stored accounts was very large, it might not be easy to establish. In the afternoon opening, the Northern Gang's advances and issuances were balanced. 2nd and 55th issue bonds were slightly bought. The rises and falls of the previous issues were not uniform. However, due to short position transfers, salt tax bonds were raised by .4 this month, and the far term was down slightly by .1. The closing caused multiple parties to transfer their positions, and market prices mostly rose uniformly. Unified tax bonds rebounded by .5. Salt tax bonds only rose by .2 this month, and the far term rose by .5. According to the closing situation, the trend was quite firm. The prospect of rises and falls will still depend mainly on the war shrinking or expanding. As a result, market prices uniformly rose by .2 to .55. The total number of transactions was 6,563,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in cash, with salt tax futures accounting for 2.06 million alone, 1.39 million in demobilization bonds, 1.18 million in unified tax bonds, and 650,000 in the 21st issue customs bonds, with the rest only at 340,000. There was less than 100,000 each in the 18th issue customs bonds, demobilization bonds, and the 6th and 96th issues of whole issue bonds.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<h3>The Quiet Silk Flower Market</h3>
<p>The silk market is stable, and the situation remains firm because American cotton is unavailable. Speculators have consistently absorbed a significant amount, but the actual demand is also quiet. Various businesses are facing economic difficulties, and their purchasing power is very weak. As for sellers, they sell whenever prices rise. Currently, some are hoping that American prices will tend to rise and their bullish sentiment has not ceased; however, their inventory is too large, creating heavier pressure.</p>
<p>(Some Bulls in the Futures Silk Market) Before the human call, the opening of the market, American cotton continued to be unavailable, and the atmosphere was flat. It was reported that Indian cotton slightly fell, with each month dropping by two or three coins. After two or three rounds, prices rebounded again. As a result, each month rose or fell by one or two coins. In the afternoon, some purchases were made for bullish positions, with each month rising by three, four, or six coins. The total trading volume for the day was 10,500 bales. It was found that Chun Kee sold 550 bales, Da Chang Cheng 600 bales, Da 400 bales, and Ren Feng 500 bales. The buyers were Ming De 1,100 bales, Chang Kee 850 bales, and Da Chang 600 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human Call Closing Prices Rise/Fall Inventory Balance</p>
<p>June 1430 Rise 431, 950</p>
<p>March 1393 Rise 228, 650</p>
<p>July 1443 624,000</p>
<p>April 1406 345,200</p>
<p>August 1449 37,450</p>
<p>May 1418 341,700</p>
<p>Total 178,950</p>
<p>(Only 323 Bales of Silk Sold) The current silk sales are quite sluggish. It was found that various businesses purchased a total of 323 bales throughout the day. The market was flat, and the purchase amounts of various businesses are as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu 40 Ningbo 9 Guangdong 40 Northern Businesses 5 Fujian 5 Xiamen 10</p>
<p>Wenzhou 5 Shantou 94 Inland 75 Fellow Traders 30 Anqing 5</p>
<p>The cotton market remains calm, but the atmosphere is still good. Buyers firmly hold on to the amounts they have purchased. Most believe that gold prices will fall and commodity prices will rise, so their bullish intentions are still strong. However, judging from the overall situation, the market still lacks sufficient vitality. The prices offered by various foreign firms for Indian cotton are extremely accommodating. Factories, seeing the poor silk market, dare not purchase large quantities and adhere to the principle of buying only as needed.</p>
<p>(Slight Short Covering in the Afternoon Cotton Market) Before the Zheng Call, the opening of the market, American cotton was unavailable, and gold prices fell again, with each month dropping by five fen to one coin. After two or three rounds, prices slowly rebounded. In the afternoon, it was reported that the gold market had again passed the 700 tael mark, and some positions were short covered. Each month then rose by five fen to one and a half coins. The total trading volume for the day was 28,200 dan. It was found that Da Chang Cheng sold 1,400 dan, Heng Chang 3,100 dan, Yu Chang 2,300 dan, Geng Feng 1,000 dan, and Chang Feng 1,800 dan. The buyers were Yi Chang 1,700 dan, Chang Feng 1,000 dan, Da Kee 1,200 dan, Li Chang 1,100 dan, and Xin Heng 1,200 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Call Closing Prices Rise/Fall Inventory Balance</p>
<p>June 5200 Rise 0 579,100</p>
<p>March 3130 Rise 20 68,700</p>
<p>July 5220 81,200</p>

<p>August 3240 10 28,800</p>
<p>May 3185 0 592,200</p>
<p>Total 445,400</p>
<p>(Large Volume of Indian Cotton Trades) The current cotton trading is slightly more active, and there is a large volume of Indian cotton trades. The sources are estimated as 35 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<p>Wheat Futures Moved by the Label Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning, the market for each month was extremely quiet, with only slight trading in March and July, and the rest were empty calls. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, because foreign wheat quotations were small, and the flour market in the morning also saw a large amount of activity, people's sentiment was not good, and selling was smooth. This situation was purely driven by the flour market, because the buyers are all laymen, and have no real ability to take delivery of goods. As a result, this month fell by three points, April fell by one point, July fell by three points, and August fell by two points.</p>
<h3>Canadian Wheat Reported Down, Label Flour Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>丨Tianjin Businesses and Factories Have Filed丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, each month presented a tragic decline. Canadian wheat quotations were also down about 0.03 yuan, and since the sharp drop in gold prices, there seemed to be another opportunity for selling foreign wheat. Australian wheat asking prices were as low as 3.38 yuan, and although the situation in the north had turned from danger to safety, the overall situation was still not optimistic. Therefore, all markets in Tianjin had filed. Large and small factories also continued to sell smoothly due to the loosening of foreign wheat and the remaining chips. Therefore, people's hearts were greatly discouraged, and everyone sold off. General speculative short positions also filed as much as possible, resulting in a considerable decline in each month. In the future, if foreign wheat floods the market or there are signs of further loosening, March and April will fall by 1.5 fen compared to the previous day, May will fall by 2.25 fen, June and July will fall by 2.5 fen, and August will fall by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>The Strike Has Not Been Resolved, and the Rice Market Down the River Remains Settled</h3>
<p>New and Old Minor Sales Continue to Open 10,000 Bags</p>
<p>Guest Xian Rice Arrival Rare and Sales Not Prosperous</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Although the strike wave was mediated by the Social Bureau inviting leaders from various rice industry groups to find a solution yesterday, it has not yet been resolved because the boatmen and inspectors have not agreed, and the source of arrival in Shanghai has also disappeared. Only the goods from the truck stations and factories have a slight transaction. Due to rain, the market situation is settled.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Transactions continue to be active. The British firm Xiangmao Foreign Firm sold 10,000 bags to the grain merchant Xin Chen Xiaojiao, which is still a wholesale transaction. It is said that the customer is still for military needs, but the handling firm and the seller do not announce its destination. However, there is no such large appetite in this street and the Fujian gang. Chen Xiaojiao accounted for 5,000 bags, and the price was still 7.45 yuan. Xin Xiaojiao had 5,000 bags, which was the Zhongguan goods, and the price was 0.2 yuan more expensive than the previous day, which was 7.55 yuan.</p>
<p>(Guest Xian) No tickets arrived yesterday, but sales turned weak. Less than 3,000 bags were opened in the whole market. The market situation was slightly smaller. 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were opened at a price of 8.5 yuan to 8.45 yuan. 740 bags of Hunan machine oil rice were priced at 8.58 yuan to 8.55 yuan, and 600 bags of machine red rice were priced at 8.42 yuan, and 400 bags of machine Jing rice were priced at 7.64 yuan. The machine oil machine Jing was purchased by this street, and the rest were shipped by the gang.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Driven by the Oil Cake Market</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the increase in the oil market and the still available cake sales, factories are interested in handling beans, and the prices have been relaxed a lot. It has stepped out of the 4 yuan mark. Yesterday, 7 cars of Zhengyang beans were traded, and the price opened at 4.06 yuan to 4.03 yuan. 2 cars of Zhangcheng beans were priced at 4.02 yuan. Pudong Du beans and Chongming sand yellow have not been discontinued, but due to the heavy goods relationship, it is difficult to develop for a while.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<p>Pull Over Woolen Cloth Sales are Smooth</p>
<p>Actual sales of woolen cloth have moved. The market for pull-over woolen cloth for suits is even smoother. Currently, materials such as herringbone spring overcoat materials, gray Shawi, medium-thick , checkered Gong Hanling, and four-bubble Dukes have all had large-scale transactions. Spring thin woolen cloth with a price range of 4-5 taels is particularly popular in the sales market. There are many types of materials, and the shipments are enthusiastic. Shende thin woolen cloth is sold for 8 yuan, Lihe checkered Gong for 12 yuan, Hualun fine woolen cloth for 10 yuan, Shunquanlong flannel for 5.25 yuan, Lin Nan Hanling Peng for 7.8 yuan, Xinzong Shawi for 7 yuan, and Yongle herringbone woolen cloth for 6.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Tea Industry Declines</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Wuyuan tea industry has suffered losses due to the decline in sales of Russian Zhuang Gongxi and the impact of various Lu Ke competing to make extracted core tea, resulting in large losses for merchants. Recently, due to the tightening of loans by tea houses, weak capital, and the difficulty of maintaining tea companies, it is expected that this year's number of tea houses on this route will be reduced by 50-60 compared with last year, and most will reduce their business scope. The decline of the tea industry can be seen. However, it is heard that some Wuyuan gang tea merchants believe that if the Wuyuan tea industry wants to survive, it must advance the picking period. A vigorous campaign is currently underway to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>This Morning He Left Beiping by Ford Airplane</p>

<p>He Yingqin Planning the Aftermath of North China in Beiping</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang Arrives in Shijiazhuang, Yan Xishan Will Also Go</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang flew to Shanghai by Ford airplane this morning, intending to stay temporarily at the Song residence. (Eleventh Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Zhang Xueliang resigned, he originally planned to set up a command headquarters in Beiping. After consultation yesterday, it was decided to retain the name of branch headquarters, with He Yingqin acting on his behalf. Zhang originally intended to go abroad for medical treatment, but after receiving a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, he obeyed orders and went to Shanghai. (Eleventh Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Zhang's resignation, the Central Anti-Japanese military affairs are still proceeding according to the original plan. In addition to the several central divisions that have already arrived in Tianjin and the forward defense, a large number of central and southwestern troops are continuing to head north. (Eleventh Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed: "To all newspaper offices and comrades across the country: My father and I have always taken the maintenance of China's sovereignty in the Northeast as our duty. My father even sacrificed himself for it. After I took office, I continued to uphold my father's legacy, always taking the consolidation of central unification of China as my duty, working diligently and never changing. For example, disregarding Japan's open threats to change the flag, assisting the Kuomintang's activities in the Northeast, and in the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic of China, I was ordered to enter the customs to support the unification of China. All these facts are there. I deeply believe that only a sound government can resist foreign aggression. When the September 18th Incident occurred, I was ill in Beiping. Initially, I thought that appealing to the League of Nations would uphold justice. Today, when the Japanese army invaded Rehe, I was ordered to defend the territory, so I led my troops to engage with the enemy. Since the beginning of the war, many officers and soldiers have sacrificed their lives. Regardless of the success or failure of the matter, tens of thousands of subordinates have sacrificed for the country. Knowing that Chiang Kai-shek's coming north this time, after consultation, made me realize that my resignation today is the best way to show my loyalty to the Party and the country and to consolidate the Central Government, so I resolutely resign to apologize to the people of the country. However, I am concerned about my comrades-in-arms of many years, the brave men of the Northeast. Are they not all soldiers of the country? In the 19th year, I was ordered to lead troops into the customs to assist the Central Government. Today, the national crisis has not ended, the territory has not been recovered, and tens of thousands of people have no home to return to. I only hope that the Central Government will look upon their hard work and give them guidance, and I also ask people from all walks of life to give them assistance. They are all enthusiastic for the country and their hometowns, and they are familiar with the situation in the Northeast. If they have the opportunity to serve the country, use them to contribute to the recovery of the Northeast and fulfill their aspirations, so as to avoid wandering. This is all I ask. I also hope that the people of the country will see my sincerity and understand my mediocrity. Although there are many faults, my original intention is only to serve the country, and I will not consider anything else." Zhang Xueliang kowtows. (Eleventh Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The US President Persists in Eliminating the Financial Crisis</h3>
<p>Investigating Sound Banks Nationwide to Allow Resumption of Business</p>
<p>Requesting Congress to Reduce Pensions and Political Expenses</p>
<p>The Gold Ban Will Continue to Be Strictly Enforced</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 10th: President Roosevelt today signed an order instructing Treasury Secretary Woodin to grant licenses to member banks of the Federal Reserve System that are sound, allowing them to resume operations. However, the gold ban will still be strictly enforced. Non-member state banks must obtain the approval of the state bank authorities before they can reopen. Treasury Secretary Woodin declared that twelve central Federal Reserve banks will reopen for business on the . Secretary of State Hull stated that once the domestic banking difficulties are resolved, the US government will begin diplomatic talks with various countries to lay the foundation for a successful world economic and financial conference.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 10th: After his victory yesterday, President Roosevelt is now persisting in attacking the payment of pensions to veterans in his economic plan. The bill was submitted to the Senate today, requesting Congress to immediately reduce this expenditure for those who have not completely lost their ability to serve and are still able to audit accounts. Although the President did not explain the detailed methods, it is estimated semi-officially that 300,000,000 yuan can be saved annually. President Roosevelt also asked Congress to allow him to reduce the salaries of government civil servants, up to a maximum of 15 percent, which is expected to save 450 million yuan annually. The shortfall in national expenditure for the 1933 fiscal year will exceed 1,200,000,000 yuan (excluding loans from the Financial Reconstruction Corporation). If no action is taken immediately for the 1934 national expenditure, the shortfall will be around 1,000,000,000 yuan, and short-term government bonds worth hundreds of millions of yuan must be repaid in the spring, so reform is urgent.</p>
<p>Havas Washington, 10th: Treasury Secretary Woodin declared that twelve Federal Reserve Banks will resume business tomorrow. The Presidential decree on the reopening of banks and the indefinite extension of the gold export ban was unanimously approved by Congress today. American banks can now be divided into three levels: the first level, 5,000 banks, is fully solvent; the second level, 4,000 banks, is in a stable position, but the Treasury Department will investigate their creditworthiness; the third level is all other small banks, and it is generally expected that these small banks will not be able to recover after closing.</p>
<p>Havas Washington, 10th: President Roosevelt's request to Congress to reduce the maintenance fees for World War veterans has prompted veterans to send telegrams to members of Congress to protest. As a result, some members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives have launched a movement against the President's request, but Democratic leaders are confident that Roosevelt will achieve a final victory.</p>
<h3>US Senators Resume Silver Coinage Movement</h3>
<p>Advocating Government Purchase of Silver to Raise Silver Prices</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 10th: Senator Pittman has now resumed his silver coinage movement in the Senate. Pitt has reintroduced two bills that he proposed in the previous Congress: one is to allow the United Kingdom to use silver to pay off its war debts to the United States, limited to 100 million yuan, with a maximum of four shillings and five pence per ounce; the other is to allow the government to purchase domestic silver, 5 million ounces per month, and issue this coupon at the same time, so that it can become another standard for US currency. The second proposal by Senator Pittman has already been approved by the Senate Banking Committee. Now Pitt has also proposed a third proposal, advocating that the government purchase silver worth 250,000,000 yuan on the open market. Pitt believes that this move can eliminate the existing silver surplus and allow the price of silver to rise with the application of economic laws. Purchases will stop when the price of silver rises to 1.29 yuan per ounce.</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Stormtroopers Spread Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>Occupying Kehl Barracks</p>
<p>Havas Strasbourg, Germany, 10th: Hitler's stormtroopers occupied the Kehl barracks in the demilitarized zone of the Rhine River. This afternoon, they hung the imperial flag at the local station and the Nazi Party flag at the county government office, and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Havas Geneva, 10th: The occupation of the Kehl barracks by the Nazi Party stormtroopers has been widely commented on in the armistice room of the Disarmament Conference. It is said that the occupation of the Kehl barracks by military organizations is the beginning of the German government's use of these organizations. The Military Quota Committee is currently discussing what kind of military organizations should be included in the military quota. This question can be answered in the Kehl incident. Some people in the rest room recalled that the Saar Local Committee had used the name of the League of Nations to prohibit the stormtroopers from practicing in the Saar. Others mentioned Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that all German military exercises, as well as the stationing or assembly of troops, whether temporary or permanent, are prohibited in the entire left bank of the Rhine River and the area on the right bank within fifty kilometers from the river bank.</p>
<h3>Organizing Armed Police</h3>
<p>Considered a Violation of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>Fearing It Will Lead to British and French Intervention</p>
<p>Reuters Paris, 10th: It is reported that political circles in France and Britain believe that Germany's recent order to recruit helmeted groups and Hitler's assault squads into the police force is a violation of the Treaty of Versailles. France and Britain are afraid that they will have to take diplomatic action on this matter.</p>
<h3>Jews Suffer Abuse</h3>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 10th: Chancellor Hitler had previously formally stated that he respected the lives and property of Jews, but the Brownshirts have forgotten this when they fanatically insult their political enemies in recent days. Jews and Communists are now suffering the same abuse. The suffering of the Jews is truly unbearable. Shopkeepers are forced by the authorities to open their doors as usual, but they are attacked by fanatical party members, and sometimes their homes and churches are destroyed. Jews are now suffering from violence and many families are sleeping together for protection. Jewish children are especially unhappy. They are often insulted and beaten in the streets and schools, and school rules strictly prohibit absenteeism.</p>
<h3>Deutsche Bank Will Be Nationalized</h3>
<p>Reuters Berlin, 10th: There are rumors that the government intends to consolidate its control over the management of Deutsche Bank, and there is even talk of nationalization, so the price of the bank's shares today is . Financial circles expect that the president of the bank, Dr. Schacht, will resign soon.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen's Talk This Morning</h3>
<p>National Mobilization to Resist to the End</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Decides to Sit in North China and Preside</p>
<p>Yan Feng and the Southwest are United in Resisting Japan, Regardless of Boundaries</p>
<p>Compromise and Direct Negotiations are All Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>War Between the Two Countries Cannot Be Proportioned by Armaments</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, flew north earlier to participate in the Baoding Conference. After deciding on the major military and financial plans for North China, he returned to Shanghai by the original plane at 2 pm yesterday. This newspaper reporter specially visited his residence on Qiqi Road at 11 am this morning. Song said that the military plan for North China has been decided, and no matter what, we will resist to the end. Even if the Japanese army can capture Nanjing, our determination to resist will not change in the slightest. He also refuted rumors of compromise, direct negotiations, and neutral zones, saying that under these circumstances, there is absolutely no possibility of negotiation. His attitude was extremely激昂. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>The reporter first asked what the recent situation in North China was like. Song replied, "The fighting outside Gubeikou is extremely fierce. Sun Dianying's troops are also fighting with the enemy in the . Sun's troops are poorly equipped, but they are able to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. The soldiers are loyal and brave, and they deserve to be commended. The rear of Sun's troops can be supplied from Dolun and has not been cut off by the Japanese army, so they will not be surrounded by the enemy."</p>
<h3>Military Plan Decided</h3>
<p>When asked about the results of the Baoding Conference, he replied, "Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Xueliang and I met in Baoding to discuss the military and financial plans for North China, which have been largely decided. As for the approval of Zhang Xueliang's resignation, there is currently no clear order from the Central Government." He was also asked whether the arrangements for the Northeast Army to be transferred to the rear and the Central Army to be transferred to the front were also decided at the meeting. He replied, "Now that we are resisting Japan, all the soldiers in the country are united, and there is no distinction between the Northeast Army and the Central Army."</p>
<h3>Yan Feng is United in Resisting Japan</h3>
<p>When asked about Yan Feng's attitude and whether they planned to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, Song replied, "Yan's representative, Xu Yongchang, met with Chiang Kai-shek in Shijiazhuang this time, and the result was very satisfactory. Mr. Feng supports extreme resistance, so he fully agrees with the military plan." He was also asked whether Yan Feng organized civilian groups in Zhangjiakou and planned to go to the front line to kill the enemy. Song said that he had not heard of it. He asked whether Feng would take up anti-Japanese military work and under what name. He replied that he was not sure.</p>
<h3>National Soldiers Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>When asked whether the Southwest's dispatch of troops to resist Japan could be realized, he replied, "Now the whole country is completely united against foreign aggression. The troops of all provinces are willing to go to the front line to kill the enemy, and there is no distinction between the Southwest and the Central Government. While the soldiers are killing the enemy on the front line, I hope that the people in the rear will also actively carry out anti-Japanese work, uniting from top to bottom to jointly cope with this unprecedented national crisis."</p>
<h3>British Mediation is Not True</h3>
<p>When asked whether it was heard that Reuters reported that the British Ambassador Lampson was going to mediate again and that the Japanese had proposed to designate the area along the Great Wall from Yuguan to Gubeikou as a neutral zone, he replied, "Absolutely not. Under the current circumstances, compromise and direct negotiations are all propaganda released by the Japanese to ease international scrutiny. No matter what, we will resist to the end. Wherever the Japanese army goes, resistance will follow. Even if the Japanese army can capture Nanjing, our determination to resist and our military plan will not change."</p>
<h3>Fight to the Death with the Enemy</h3>
<p>When asked, "In your previous speech, you said that our army is from the 17th and 18th centuries and cannot fight the Japanese army. I am afraid that this resistance will repeat the mistakes of Rehe. What do you think?" Song resolutely replied, "This is precisely my strongest expression. Resistance cannot be judged by success or failure. Victory is gratifying, and we will continue to fight even if we fail. Moreover, what I call the army of the 17th and 18th centuries refers to the troops of Tang Yulin. There are many excellent troops in the country, and we cannot generalize. We should take the Rehe incident as a lesson and improve the weaknesses of our army so that we can kill the enemy and win. Moreover, war between the two countries cannot be precisely observed based on the superiority or inferiority of armaments or the strength of the army. For example, if Germany has a six-inch caliber cannon that is more numerous than the French, will France surrender because of this? Or if the number of British battleships is several times that of Japan, will Japan immediately surrender? Therefore, if we compare the strength of armaments and troops, there is no war to be fought between the two countries. Our country's situation is exactly like this. We should use the courage of the nation, the unity of the people, and fight to the death with the enemy, using the flesh and blood of the nation to open a way out. Therefore, today is the only opportunity for our country's revival. Life and death, survival and extinction, depend on this one move."</p>
<h3>Song Will Not Go North Temporarily</h3>
<p>Song also said, "Since President Wang went abroad, I have been acting as the President of the Executive Yuan. Now President Wang will return to China on the 17th and arrive in Shanghai. After that, there will be someone responsible for all major political plans. I will devote myself to planning finances. Therefore, I will not go north temporarily. Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, plans to reside in North China to command the military. Although the military expenditure in North China is not very abundant, it is already sufficient to cope with it."</p>
<h3>Punish Negligent Generals</h3>
<p>As for the punishment of the responsible generals for the fall of Rehe, Tang Yulin has been arrested by the government. As for other generals such as Zhang Zuoxiang, I have not discussed it in detail with Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang because I stayed in the north for a very short time. I do not know how to deal with it. In short, the Central Government will have the fairest way to clarify rewards and punishments, maintain discipline, and boost morale.</p>
<h3>Plan to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>The reporter also asked whether the Central Government's so-called military plan was only to resist and stop there, and how to recover the lost territory and whether to counterattack Chengde. He replied, "Chiang Kai-shek's determination to resist has been detailed in his talks with reporters in Zhengzhou. As for the recovery of lost territory and the counterattack against Chengde, it depends on the progress of the military. I am not a military expert, so I do not know the detailed plan."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Today, there is a rumor that Zhang Xueliang is coming to Shanghai by plane. The reporter took the opportunity to ask about it. Song said, "There is no telegram to Shanghai this morning." He was also asked about the situation in Beiping and Tianjin, which is very tense. Will the Japanese army really seize North China? He replied, "We do not ask how the Japanese army is progressing. Wherever the Japanese army goes, resistance will follow. The Central Government has already made up its mind."</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Goes to Hong Kong This Morning to Welcome Wang</h3>
<p>The Railway Department's Issuance of Public Bonds is Postponed Due to the Suspension of Boxer Indemnity Payments</p>
<p>Cleaning Up the Outstanding Foreign Debt of 1.3 Billion Yuan Will Proceed</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei and his wife are returning to China on the French mail ship Aramis, which will pass through Hong Kong on the 14th and arrive in Shanghai on the 17th. Ministers from all departments of the Executive Yuan will come to Shanghai to welcome Wang. Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways, took the French ship Baodaosi to Hong Kong at around 10 am this morning to welcome Wang. According to Zeng's statement to the New Voice Agency reporter, the Railway Department borrowed money from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to complete the Yuehan Railway and issued 1,220,000 pounds of public bonds. Recently, it has been suspended due to the suspension of Boxer Indemnity payments for one year. It will find other ways to complete it. The total amount of foreign debt owed by Chinese railways to various countries in the past is extremely huge. According to the report of the Ministry of Finance, the principal and interest have now reached more than 1.3 billion yuan, of which British and Belgian loans account for the majority. The Railway Department has decided to clean it up because it has such a huge amount of foreign debt, and even just the interest that should be paid each year requires about 100 million yuan, so it has decided to clean it up so that it can find ways to gradually repay it in the future. The relocation of the North Station and the land acquisition have also been suspended for the time being, and will be determined after seeking the opinions of the ministers of the Executive Yuan. According to Wang's previous telegram, he is not yet fully recovered. It is not yet certain whether he will return to Beijing to take office immediately after arriving in Shanghai. Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, originally intended to go to Europe to attend the World Economic Conference, but it is unlikely to be realized due to the current national crisis, and it has been largely suspended. It is said that Zeng will arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow morning and come to Shanghai on the same ship after meeting Wang the next day. Zeng had notified Wang by radio before leaving.</p>
<h3>Large US Navy Fleet Will Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Arriving on April 1st</p>
<p>Causing Japanese Newspapers to Intend</p>
<p>The US Asian Fleet is staying in Manila and Guam. There are more than 30 ships, including destroyers and torpedo boats, divided into six teams, led by the flagship Black Hawk. It has been confirmed that the entire US Asian Fleet has been scheduled to depart from Manila on April 1st and go directly to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, it will be assigned to Jiaozhou Bay, Bohai Bay and Shanghai for mooring.</p>
<p>Today, the Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that the US battleship Houston is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the first day of next month, but the number of small ships accompanying the ship is still unclear. However, according to the latest reports from Washington, as soon as the Houston arrives in Shanghai, battleships will continue to come east, and the concentration of the US combined fleet in the East is still in the spring. The fleet is scheduled to moor several destroyers in Zhifu, submarines in Qingdao, and other warships are scheduled to arrive in Wusong in succession in mid-April.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Disarmament Conference is Bleak</h3>
<p>France and Germany Hold Diametrically Opposed Views</p>
<p>Britain Finds Mediation Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (Reuters) – The darkness of the Disarmament Conference's future and the hopelessness of reaching an agreement have never been as pronounced as they are today. British Prime Minister MacDonald is about to arrive in Geneva at this very moment. On any important matter concerning disarmament, a complete deadlock is evident between France and Germany, with neither side showing any sign of compromise. Germany believes that since it has disarmed, it bears no responsibility. What it demands, whether it be armament or disarmament, is simply equality. France, on the other hand, states that the extent of France's disarmament must be governed by the degree of security that France obtains. The conflict in viewpoints is evident on every issue in the conference, regardless of whether the discussion concerns troop numbers, weapons, air forces, or the abolition of war. Making the Prime Minister's task even more difficult is the absence of key officials from Germany, France, and Italy. Germany is unwilling to send Chancellor von Papen or Foreign Minister Neurath until it receives concrete proposals. French Premier Daladier is also unwilling to risk being besieged by a united front of Britain, the United States, and Italy in Geneva. Italy has expressed great sympathy and attention but has not explicitly declared its support for Germany's position. However, the recent resolution of the Fascist Grand Council has confirmed Italy's stance. At the same time, the rapprochement between Poland and Soviet Russia is now apparent, and this has led to a closer understanding between France and Russia. This shift has been prompted by German Chancellor Hitler's anti-communist actions. Considering all the aforementioned circumstances, Prime Minister MacDonald hopes to obtain some form of agreement or, at least, a supplementary agreement for an armaments truce. However, even this approach will be strongly opposed by Germany, making the future extremely bleak.</p>
<h3>British Authorities Depart Paris for Geneva</h3>
<p>Official Statement Acknowledges Tensions in the Disarmament Issue</p>
<p>Determined to Seek International Compromise to Maintain Peace</p>
<p>Paris, 10th – Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon have departed for Geneva. French Premier Daladier intends to visit Geneva early next week at their specific request. Today, after MacDonald, Daladier, Poncet, and Simon concluded their discussions, they stated that they were quite optimistic. After the meeting, a public statement was issued, stating that all members fully acknowledged the urgency of the Geneva issue, especially in relation to the current situation in Europe. All members declared their determination to seek a compromise with other countries to preserve world peace.</p>
<h3>German Representative's Security Demands</h3>
<p>Hopes for a Practical Resolution at the Conference</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (Havas) – The German representative to the Disarmament Conference, Nadolny, published an article in "The League of Nations Journal," concluding that "Germany has already disarmed and is extremely vulnerable to insecurity. Therefore, Germany must formally reject any proposals to postpone the Disarmament Conference and seek other temporary solutions. For thirteen years, Germany has been waiting for all countries to implement disarmament as stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles in order to restore security. The Disarmament Conference has been working for fourteen months, and the time has come to take real decisions. We are compelled to demand a practical resolution from the Disarmament Conference."</p>
<h3>Italian Premier Encourages Blackshirt Comrades</h3>
<p>Rome, 10th (Havas) – The Fascist Party leadership held a meeting last night, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini. The Prime Minister declared that Italy's political goal is not to disturb world peace but to assist in the political, economic, and spiritual reconstruction of Europe. He also stated that if the Disarmament Conference abandons Italy's specific proposals, it will not achieve positive results. The Prime Minister urged all Italian Blackshirts to strive for the strength of the nation and to spread Fascism throughout the world.</p>
<h3>Political Committee Discusses Definition of Aggressor</h3>
<p>Majority Supports Soviet Russian Proposal</p>
<p>British and American Representatives Express Doubts</p>
<p>Japanese and German Representatives are Guilt-Ridden</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (Reuters) – The Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference met this afternoon to discuss the Soviet Russian proposal regarding the definition of an aggressor. Russian representative Dovgalevsky stated that only complete disarmament could guarantee security, but since the Soviet Union's proposal to achieve this goal has not gained support, he believed it was necessary to define a strict method to naturally determine who is the aggressor. Chinese representative Dr. Lo Chung-yi stated that he believed the issue of applying Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant should also be studied, and the current situation in the Far East proves the importance of this issue. He expressed his agreement with the Russian plan and deeply regretted the lack of a solution to the problem of undeclared wars. If such a solution existed, China would not be suffering as it is today. Several speakers supported the Russian proposal, but France gave it limited approval. British representative Eden and American representative Whitehouse expressed doubts about whether such a strict definition of an aggressor could be implemented or whether it would be beneficial. Japanese representative Yada stated that the definition of an aggressor would often involve various difficult problems that must be considered and disputed, requiring difficult investigations. He argued that a fair method focusing on practicality should be sought. After repeated discussions, the Political Committee assigned a drafting committee to draft clauses for further discussion.</p>
<p>Geneva, 10th (Havas) – The Soviet Russian representative has submitted a proposal to the Disarmament Conference regarding the definition of an aggressor. This afternoon, the Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference will present the proposal for discussion. The Soviet Russian representative believes that the definition of an aggressor should be issued in the form of a declaration, which should be global in nature and included in the Security and Disarmament Convention, or as a separate compromise and considered part of the Disarmament Convention. This declaration would regard all hostile actions, except formal declarations of war, that have not undergone the declaration of war procedure as acts of aggression. The Soviet Russian representative stated that the more automatically it can be proven who is the aggressor in international conflicts, the more international peace will benefit. This aligns with France's opinion. This proposition of the Soviet Russian representative was generally welcomed, with China, Norway, Poland, Ireland, and France supporting it, while the United States criticized it.</p>
<h3>"National Soul Eliminates Traitors" Group Member Liu Chongwu and Others Appeal</h3>
<p>Trial Opens This Morning</p>
<p>Adjourned for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Liu Chongwu and other members of the "National Soul Eliminates Traitors" group, angered by traitorous merchants privately selling enemy goods and undermining the patriotic movement, gathered comrades and went to various traitorous merchants to warn them. When the merchants refused to listen, the group gave them bombs or opened fire, resulting in injuries and deaths. The police arrested Liu and several others, and the Special District Court filed charges against them for conspiracy to murder. After investigation, Liu Chongwu was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songsheng, Tian Shuiyang, Zhu Erkang, and Hua Zhongyuan, whose involvement was minor, were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from four months to one month. Tian and Zhu were both granted a two-year suspended sentence. Details have been reported previously. It is now learned that Liu Chongwu, dissatisfied with the verdict, has filed an appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court through his defense lawyers Fan Gang and Chen Tingrui. The Municipal Council also considered the sentences imposed on the defendants to be too lenient and has filed an appeal with the High Court. This morning, Judge Zhou Han of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court specially opened the Second Tribunal, summoned witnesses, and conducted a hearing on Liu's case. Judge Zhou assigned lawyer Fan Gang and others to defend the other appellants, as they were unable to hire lawyers themselves, to protect their legal interests. The Municipal Council's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, first stated the reasons for appealing against the first-instance judgment. The court then questioned each of the defendants in turn. Liu and others generally stated that they were warning the traitorous merchants because they were angry about their private sale of enemy goods. They either completely denied or claimed self-defense in relation to the shooting of Wang Zhengqing, manager of Maotai Foreign Goods Store on Xinzha Road, Wang Yirong, partner of Yuyuanheng Foreign Goods Store on Hankou Road, and the bombing and injury of Ku Bin Tai. The court then summoned witnesses for testimony. The court adjourned until noon, and Liu and others were returned to custody for further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>The "Lichuan" Steamer on the Suzhou-Hangzhou Route Robbed for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Robbed Near Lake Tai</p>
<p>Please Urge the Water Police Bureau to Arrest the Bandits</p>
<p>The "Lichuan" steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the Suzhou-Hangzhou route was robbed last month, as reported in this newspaper. Recently, the ship was robbed by bandits for the second time. The captain of the steamer has reported the incident to Shanghai. According to the report, the "Lichuan" steamer departed from Hangzhou on the 3rd of this month with only twenty passengers, mostly women. Around 2 a.m. on the morning of the 4th, when the ship was near Linghu, it was dark. As the "Lichuan" passed, bandits who had been lying in wait along the riverbanks fired warning shots and ordered the ship to stop. The captain had no choice but to stop the engine. Six or seven bandits boarded the ship, first guarding the people on board and then proceeding to rob them. None of the passengers were spared. The captain, the purser, and others were also searched. Even small silver coins, copper coins, jewelry, and clothing were taken. Because there were not many passengers, and they were all poor, less than two hundred yuan was stolen. No one was injured. Before leaving, the bandits shouted that their luck was bad. Later, when the "Lichuan" arrived in Suzhou and docked, the passengers were in a state of disarray. The captain has reported the incident to the Shanghai office, which has reported it to the Inland Water Police Bureau, urging them to arrest the bandits and to send police to protect the Suzhou-Hangzhou route.</p>

<h3>Obstacles During Factory Inspections in Concessions</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Continues to Negotiate</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was ordered to conduct factory inspections, the initial inspections have long been completed. As for the inspections of factories in the concessions, the Municipal Government has repeatedly negotiated with the concession authorities. Although the principle of inspection has been approved, they still use excuses to obstruct it, so the concession inspections have not yet been implemented. Since the Zhengtai Factory tragedy, all circles have paid great attention to the safety of factory equipment and believe that factory inspections are urgent. The Municipal Government is continuing to negotiate to implement them as soon as possible. The Chinese Factory Inspection Association believes that the concession authorities are unreasonably obstructing the inspections and that submitting them to the Western Ratepayers' Meeting for discussion violates the rules of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After a meeting, it was decided to convene all factory unions and the press in the city to explain the situation and issue a declaration.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Also Speaking Out for Chairman Tang</h3>
<p>— Young Man</p>
<p>The loss of Rehe, which was entirely surrendered in three days but that we in the newspapers only read about on the sixth, is said now under the sun's violent reflection to have been flown with what are [several colors] and that [on the corner is something star's] flag. It is also said that this swift changing of the flag is all thanks to our Chairman Tang, General Yulin 丨 for if it weren't for our Chairman Tang who gave up Rehe very generously and decisively in less than ten days, wouldn't the common people be suffering for at least more than ten days? Can we continue to live this peaceful life at this moment? According to what is considered the eternal truth, according to the principle that [watching a play] (note) led to the loss of Shenyang, the political hub of the Northeast, which in turn led to the loss of the entire Northeast and that the Director of Pacification is concurrently the acting Chairman of the Military Sub-Committee, our Chairman Tang should not be guilty, even if he doesn't get promoted or rewarded. However, this time, our Chairman Tang has been greatly fooled! First, he angered Director Zhang, who scolded him for being timid and abandoning his post, for not resisting and losing Chengde, thus causing international shame, and advocated for his arrest and execution by firing squad! Subsequently, the Control Yuan filed an impeachment; the Executive Yuan also decided to deal with him severely; on the 8th, the National Government issued an explicit arrest warrant! The press also joined in the feeding frenzy, verbally attacking and writing condemnations, fiercely attacking the dog that has fallen into the water! Alas 丨丨 This dog 丨 Our Chairman Tang only made this one small wrong move, but does it warrant such pressure that he feels utterly at a loss? If he is forced to take his own life, wouldn't that be a miscarriage of justice? How will that be accounted for then?·······</p>
<p>Not only that. Chinese people are particularly fond of beating a dog that has fallen into the water. Little do they know that foreigners also enjoy this pastime. Look, the Shen Bao's Tianjin dispatch on the 8th:</p>
<p>Tang Yulin shaved his beard and disfigured his face, disguised himself as a peasant, mixed into a refugee column, sneaked through Gubeikou, took a car to the suburbs of Tianjin, walked into the French Concession, and then into the British Concession because of the tightened security. He has moved his residence several times. The French Municipal Council cut out Tang's photos from various newspapers and sent them to various hotels to ask them to pay attention to travelers with similar photos and sent police to search the home of Tang's brother, Yushan, confiscating over ten thousand taels of opium and over ten handguns. Tang's brother was arrested on the spot, his hands and feet shackled, along with the contraband. The family scattered and fled, their state extremely miserable!</p>
<p>It is hateful that foreigners always like to make fun of people who are down on their luck. We can naturally understand without saying the predicament of our Chairman Tang, so we should kneel and weep for our Chairman Tang! The reasons are: (1) The loss of Rehe was due to a lack of an overall defense plan, with the central and local governments relying on each other. Our Chairman Tang's behind only [chairman] what [seat] how does he manage so much? (2) The politics in Rehe were too bad, and the people's hearts had long been lost. Our Chairman Tang doesn't have the ability to bring the dead back to life or to turn the world upside down. How can he save the situation? (3) The military system is complex, and the volunteer soldiers are not willing to put in effort to fight at the front. Our Chairman Tang only has two hands and two legs. He can't even escape in time. How can he block the enemy's guns? (The reasons are based on what Director Zhang's confidants said丨see the Shen Bao Extra on the 9th丨and understood). (4) Some people said that two regiments of soldiers should not have been dispatched to Shanhaiguan two months ago, resulting in Shanhaiguan being lost first. Now that Shanhaiguan is lost, hasn't Rehe become a bird in a cage, what [inside] of what? (5) People like Chairman Tang, there is not only one Chairman Tang in the whole country,</p>
<p>Based on the above five powerful reasons, I discovered the following two ultimate truths: (1) Beating a dog that has fallen into the water is a great sin. (2) Beating a dog that has fallen into the water is not heroic.</p>
<p>(Note) Gao Youtang, a member of the Control Yuan, wrote in an impeachment against Zhang Xueliang that "When the Japanese army shelled Beida Camp, Chief of Staff Rong Zhen telephoned Shenyang four times to ask for instructions on how to respond. Zhang Xueliang was watching a play at the Zhonghe Theater until the end of the play, when he returned to his residence, but Shenyang had already fallen..."</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Nicotine</h3>
<p>— Quiet</p>
<p>It is almost universally known that cigarettes are harmful, because the toxins they contain are sufficient to ruin a person's potential, drain a person's vitality, dull a person's senses, and deaden a person's thoughts. All of a person's ambitions, intelligence, and profound understanding can be dissolved and exhausted by smoking cigarettes. The intensity of the harm is truly startling!</p>
<p>It has been found that cigarettes contain eighteen kinds of toxins, and the most poisonous of them is nicotine. This substance is not found in ordinary food, nor is it included in protoplasm. Now, a brief description of it is given below: (1) Where Nicotine is Located</p>
<p>Nicotine, also known as 菸　, belongs to the alkaloids in organic chemistry. It often combines with malic acid and citric acid to form organic salts, which are stored in tobacco, tea, and their seeds. Its content is about 0.28　. Good quality ordinary cigarettes contain about 2　, while inferior ones contain more　.</p>
<p>(2) Extraction of Nicotine</p>
<p>The nicotine in tobacco leaves can be extracted by the following method: soak the tobacco leaves in hot water, boil them, mix them with milk of lime, and put them in a distillation flask with a condenser and a receiver. Then, add oxalic acid to the distillate to make it acidic, then evaporate it to concentrate it, and decompose it with potassium hydroxide to obtain free nicotine, which can be extracted with ether.</p>
<p>In ordinary laboratories, the following method is used for testing:</p>
<p>Take one cigarette, 25 CC of water, and 2 CC of dilute sulfuric acid, place them in a small distillation flask, heat to boiling, and after ten minutes, add an excess of sodium hydroxide deep solution, distill it, and then take the distillate and add various tests.</p>
<p>(3) Properties of Nicotine</p>
<p>Nicotine is a reddish oily liquid that boils at 247o C, with a strong irritating taste and an unpleasant odor. When exposed to air, it turns yellow and brown, eventually becoming a resinous liquid. It is extremely toxic, and only two or three drops can take a person's life within a few minutes. It is easily soluble in water, alcohol, solution, trapped liquid, and petroleum ether. When ignited, it mostly decomposes into carbonic acid, water, and nitrogen.</p>
<p>(4) Harms of Nicotine</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that cigarettes are poisonous, yet people still compete to smoke them, as if cigarettes can replace food. This is tantamount to self-harming one's body and mind, dulling one's intelligence, and blocking one's cleverness. Once nicotine is inhaled, it immediately flows into the blood and spreads throughout the nervous system. If someone without a nicotine addiction smokes it, they will experience dizziness, which is clear evidence that the nerves are being anesthetized. Those who smoke excessively will have trembling fingers, which shows that nicotine damages the nerves significantly. There is also the so-called "tobacco heart," which causes rapid pulse and palpitations. The reason is entirely due to the toxicity of nicotine, which directly affects the nerve cells in the cardiac nerve ganglion. Even worse is "tobacco blindness," which causes a person's eyesight to lose the sense of light in certain areas, gradually leading to blindness. Its danger is self-evident. In addition, nicotine is also harmful to the vocal cords. When smoking, the gas or dust from the smoke must pass through the opening between the two vocal cords in the larynx. The sensation of the outer layer of the vocal cords is very sensitive. Prolonged stimulation by smoke will gradually thicken it, resulting in a hoarse voice and an inability to speak or sing loudly! This harm is especially severe for opium smokers. In addition to this, smokers experience several other negative phenomena, such as a yellow and bloodless complexion, declining memory, reduced appetite, insomnia at night, fingers stained with nicotine, a mouth full of smoke odor, and the waste of useful money in useless places, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>The harmfulness of cigarettes has been described above. I sincerely hope that the people of our country will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Eulogy for Martyr Xu Zhongshu</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Comrade Xu Zhongshu of the Soviet Army died in battle in Guangdong. In addition to building a memorial tower in Jinshan Park, it is planned to bury his clothes and hat to comfort his spirit in the afterlife. This is written to express grief.</p>
<p>The Qing government was corrupt and about to collapse. Witnessing this with heartache, he seized the opportunity to rise up. With ardent passion and a determination to restore order, he worked with the Soviet Army, discussing military strategies. He was humble in learning, deeply admired for his diligence, and well-versed in the Six Secret Teachings, with outstanding intelligence. During the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to his hometown, and I followed Director Cheng to serve on the battlefield, guarding the neighborhoods and suppressing the Zhang bandits. Although our work was different, we were united in our struggle. After the failure of the Guichou Revolution, he went into hiding in his hometown. Although he took up teaching, he never forgot his mission to eliminate traitors. When Yuan Shikai was punished by heaven, he resumed his writing and, angered by the chaotic state of the government, fled south. He rejoined the army during the Southwestern Protection Movement, holding important positions in eastern Guangdong. Before the Gui rebels were eliminated, hindering the Northern Expedition, he first went on a western expedition, hoping to eliminate the warlords. The rebel army was stubborn, spying on Yangjiang. In imminent danger, filled with loyalty and indignation, the isolated army had no support. The sound of sighs frequently echoed within. Seeing this situation, he was the first to respond to the call, and his momentum grew, quickly forming a battalion. He registered names late into the night and was elected captain, making plans that very evening. Heavy rain poured down as the rebel enemies ran rampant. Raising his arms, he charged to kill the enemy, dying in battle from a bullet. Coffin made of wooden boards, a knife used to inscribe a stone, buried bones on Nine Ridge, no horse hide to wrap the body. Time flies, and eight years have suddenly passed. Remembering the martyrs, hoping to comfort their spirits in the afterlife, we bury his clothes and hat, with a tomb five feet high. Alas, Xu Jun, your loyal soul and righteous spirit.</p>
<h3>Bernard Shaw's Overthinking</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, newspapers reported that Irish humorist Bernard Shaw entertained reporters in Beiping. In addition to stating in an article that he had "no mission" in coming to the East, he also expressed his opinions on the Manchurian issue. According to a Reuters reporter, "[The millions of Chinese in Manchuria must become Irish-style Nationalists, that is, each Chinese must be guarded by one Japanese soldier with a rifle. This is, of course, impossible."</p>
<p>This so-called humorous Irishman is extremely insightful on this matter. His words are subtle and can make people smile bitterly. But when he crossed the ocean, he seemed to have forgotten to bring a pair of glasses, so his observations of China are somewhat inaccurate. Leaving aside his other arguments, what he said above is also overly optimistic.</p>
<p>Our China is large enough to be called a great power. Its 3.5 million square miles of land and 474 million people often shock foreigners. But being large and useless, like a pile of garbage, is nothing to boast about. The first main argument of general optimists ["China will not perish"] is "there are many people." Unexpectedly, the foreign Shaw was also poisoned by this. You should know that in the West, one hundred Irishmen are certainly not afraid of one hundred Asians, but in the East, 25,000 Englishmen can manage 350 million Indians. I remember that the demise of India, although directly caused by the East India Company, was indirectly completed by the Indians themselves. If there were not those Indian "traitors" who ate the "royal" salary and sucked the people's blood, I don't think the British could have destroyed India, nor could they have managed it even if they had destroyed it. What about our China? The population is said to be 400 million. If we were to have one guard for each person, then at least the entire Europe would have to be merged to deal with one China. But rest assured, the reality is definitely not as imagined. We have plenty of traitors waiting for the price, not necessarily good. Given the opportunity, they will take off their robes, put on prison uniforms, and become English sailors. Although their noses are not high enough, their skin is not white enough, and their gait is not majestic enough, they are more than enough to be ["XX Imperial Army"]. We already have some experience with this. Shaw's words are overthinking.</p>
<p>Here, we cannot but blame the hosts for their lack of consideration. When Shaw stepped on the Chinese coast, they did not give him a pair of "old-age" glasses.</p>
<h3>Smiling, I Ask the Guest Where He Comes From</h3>
<p>— Yuanxi</p>
<p>Young Madam Wu rarely went out, because all the family's social affairs were handled by Old Madam Wu.</p>
<p>One day, an unexpected guest suddenly entered. He held a bamboo cane, his clothes tattered, looking like a beggar. He sat down casually on the red sandalwood chair in the living room, coughed a few times loudly, and pulled out the dry tobacco pouch stuck in his collar to smoke.</p>
<p>"Hey! What are you doing, old man? Get out!" Young Madam Wu was so scared that she didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>"Um! I'm here to see A-Gui's mother." Then he coughed loudly a few more times.</p>
<p>"Why would he be looking for my mother-in-law!" Young Madam Wu was even more baffled. "Mom! Look at this annoying old man, a living Buddha who suddenly came in and sat down without moving!" She said to the old woman who happened to walk in.</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?" The old woman sized him up and down.</p>
<p>"I'm looking for you!"</p>
<p>"What's your name?" The old woman was a little angry.</p>
<p>"Whatever your name is, that's my name," the old man said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Um..." The old woman stared at his face, even more confused, then suddenly seemed to discover something and exclaimed half a sentence: "This is A-Gui's..." but then stopped herself. Young Madam Wu could only stare blankly!</p>
<p>"Haha! You only recognize me now?" He put on an even more old-fashioned air.</p>
<p>"I don't believe it! You have to take off your jacket first and let me recognize the birthmark on your shoulder." After seeing it, he threw his heavy, heavily patched tattered jacket on the ground, saying with a mixture of anger and joy: "You old thing! You abandoned your wife and children and left home for more than thirty years, disappearing without a trace. I thought you were long gone! Now you're back, why are you still like this?"</p>
<p>"Sin, sin! Don't look down on it, my life's blood and sweat are in it!" So he quickly picked up the tattered jacket, holding it tightly as if it were a treasure: "Ever since I left my hometown that year and went to Fengtian, I originally wanted to be a farmer, but I was hired to go to the gold mines in Heilongjiang. Life in the cellar was really bitter! Fortunately, I could steal a little bit of gold every day to supplement my meager wages, but it wasn't easy to smuggle it out of the mining area."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you ever send any news?"</p>
<p>"Not to mention that I can't write letters, even if I could, it wouldn't be easy to send them. Year after year, until the Japanese devils came to seize the mines, I was finally able to disguise myself and escape. It's a pity that I still have most of the gold leaves hidden in the ground that I didn't have time to dig out, especially the inexhaustible mineral resources, which were all seized by the Japanese devils. Alas!"</p>
<p>"Gold leaves! Didn't you bring any back at all?"</p>
<p>"Although I didn't bring back much, it's enough for us to use for the rest of our lives!"</p>
<p>"Really? Show me the real thing!"</p>
<p>"This is it!" The old man smiled and handed the heavy tattered jacket back to the old woman, cutting open strands of worn-out batting, all filled with clusters of fragmented gold!</p>
<h3>Alas, Civil Rights!</h3>
<p>Clerk Communication</p>
<h3>Renting Land Should Start with Self-Production</h3>
<p>— Liu Jingzhu</p>
<p>It has been going on for a long time.</p>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I am currently a clerk in X Incense and Candle Shop. For the past ten years, my monthly salary has only been enough to make ends meet. The other day, a relative of mine came and said that he had found a better job and wanted to transfer the small shop he runs to me. The shop has a total capital of 2,000 yuan. He wants to withdraw half of it, and I would invest 1,000 yuan. All shop affairs and expenses would be my sole responsibility. I found that the shop is conveniently located and has been quite profitable in recent years, so I am very willing and consider it a rare opportunity. However, I still lack 200-300 yuan in cash, and I am thinking of selling an acre or so of ancestral land in my hometown to raise the money. But that land was rented to the Shen family by my great-grandfather. The Shen family has built two storefront houses on the land and, seven years ago, sublet it to the Yin family. The Yin family has also built several houses. Currently, the Shen family collects 36 yuan in rent from the Yin family annually, while I only get 4,000 cash annually, and there is no rental agreement. I have repeatedly asked for an increase in rent, but the Shen family has repeatedly delayed and avoided me, and has never been willing to meet and talk. Recently, they have become even more brazen and owe more than two years of rent. I can no longer tolerate it and have long wanted to find a solution. Now, because of the matter mentioned above, I have made up my mind to order the Shen and Yin families to sell the houses to me at a discount so that I can take back the land and sell it. Editor, I don't know if this method is appropriate? I would be grateful for your reply.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Liu Jingzhu</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since Mr. Liu recognizes that taking over this small shop is a rare opportunity, you certainly cannot let it pass. As for lacking 200-300 yuan in cash and planning to sell ancestral land in your hometown to raise the money, that is appropriate. However, according to your letter, although the money seems unlikely to fall through, it may not be easy to obtain in a short time. So, we believe that Mr. Liu, on the one hand, can certainly negotiate with the Shen and Yin families; on the other hand, it is best to find other ways to raise the money. Since your relative is willing to not completely withdraw his capital, he must have great faith in you. You can discuss it with him, and you can share the profits and losses equally. Can you ask him to lend you another 200-300 yuan? He should not completely refuse, right?</p>
<p>As for the rental negotiations with the Shen and Yin families, you do not have a rental agreement. We do not know if you have other documents to prove your ownership. Do you pay the land tax on this land? If there is no proof and you do not pay the tax, the future of the negotiations is hard to say. If you have sufficient documents, then your right to the land can be confirmed. However, you cannot order them to tear down the houses, because the law stipulates that unless there is a contract, the principle of "no demolition after completion" applies. In other words, you cannot ask them to tear down the houses they built. But you also cannot confiscate them, because you did not get this kind of contract! So even if you sue in court, you will inevitably have to buy them at a price. This matter may be different. Therefore, we believe that Mr. Liu should ask someone to tell the Shen family that you are willing to transfer the land to them. If they are really stubborn and unreasonable, then you can proceed with the lawsuit, and it is best to express your willingness to transfer the land in the complaint. As for the price, you can start by making an offer, and they can counteroffer. In the end, the judge can make a fair assessment.</p>

<h3>Time in a Dream</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(1) A Shout After Waking Up</p>
<p>The day of XX month XX year of the Great Republic of China, the XX festival in Nanjing, our capital, was the most serious day. To put it more precisely, it could be said that this day was a matter of life and death that the Republic of China had never encountered in its history. The situation was equally serious throughout the country, and Nanjing was the seat of the central government, so the atmosphere was even more tense than elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the past, Nanjing was always as quiet and silent as a chaste widow who had vowed to remain faithful. The hustle and bustle of the Huaipailou Confucius Temple area was only her occasional, partial smile. On this day, although the singing in the Confucius Temple area had completely stopped due to the uneasy situation, and the shops in the Huaipailou area were all displaying signs of "expressing determination to fight, closing for one day," closing their doors like iron barrels, the whole of Nanjing was shrouded in a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere. The chaste widow had transformed into a female athlete on the sports field. On both sides of the street, three or four feet thick "walls of people" were piled up. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 or 7:00 PM, the "walls of people" never wavered. Everyone, men, women, old, and young, all exuded an extremely tragic and excited expression, waiting and discussing.</p>
<p>"Feng XX arrives in Nanjing! Cai XX sends troops..." Every one or two hours, newspaper vendors on bicycles and on foot would roll in like a whirlwind with a new batch of special editions, shouting the titles of important news items in voices that had already gone hoarse. Five thousand copies, ten thousand copies, twenty thousand copies, would be snatched up by the waiting people in less than twenty minutes!</p>
<p>Blood-red, fist-sized red characters were pasted high on the billboards at the intersections by the messengers and tea boys of the various newspapers, announcing the latest news. Before the person pasting them could even get down, the billboards were already surrounded.</p>
<p>The cars of news reporters flew madly on Zhongshan Road. The banners of "X Newspaper" and "X News Agency" in white cloth and black characters had the same effect as the sirens on fire trucks. Wherever the banners flew, all vehicles would humbly retreat to the side, allowing them to open their speed and take as much information as possible about the interim emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>The interim emergency meeting of the Central Executive Committee was convened because X country sent an ultimatum. It was scheduled to be held in the afternoon of this day in the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen under Zijin Mountain. When the clock struck two, the important people in Nanjing and the important people outside Nanjing had all arrived gracefully, preparing to participate in this serious gathering to decide the strategy of war or peace.</p>
<p>"Hey! What are you doing?" Less than half an hour after the meeting began, a middle-aged man with extremely neat clothes suddenly came to the large stone square in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum and calmly took out seven or eight very long and wide white cloths with large characters written on them, like funeral couplets, from a small rattan box he brought himself, and laid them one by one on the ground, alarming a guard.</p>
<p>"If you are a Chinese," the man handed a business card to the soldier, uttering a deeply pained voice, "if you don't want to be a slave of a conquered country, please don't interfere with me for the time being!"</p>
<p>The ten black characters "Wu Yi, President of National XX University" on the business card immediately stopped the guard's intervention. They all knew that Wu Yi was a famous educator, and at the very least, they knew that the president of a national university was an official and could not be easily offended. Therefore, they stood by with their hands tied, watching Wu Yi with a curious mind.</p>
<p>Wu Yi was a tall, handsome middle-aged man, and at this time, his face was as solemn as if covered with a layer of thick frost. After laying out the six or seven funeral couplet-like white cloths, he took out a bronze bell commonly used in schools from the small rattan box and shook it vigorously.</p>
<p>"Ding... Ling..."</p>
<p>"This won't do! This is not allowed!" The guards felt that this Dr. Wu was really making too much trouble and planned to step forward to implement military intervention.</p>
