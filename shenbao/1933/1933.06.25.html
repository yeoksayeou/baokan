<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國國家主義昂揚與世界經濟實</h3>
<p>世界經濟會議之主要任務。旣擯除戰債關係。暫不談判。則依照洛桑會議所定議程。與夫近頃世界一般之需要。當以貨幣平價之安定。爲現時關於經濟最重要之一端。無如在事實上。歐洲各國對戰債。决不肯輕於放鬆。尤希望美國能及時讓步。就此解决。而美國對此。則殊冷淡。表示願在經濟會議即席談判。於是歐美間之裂痕。由此復顯。英國對於到期戰債。縱已償付小部分。以敷衍英帝國之顔面。法尙堅持前議。并無還債之表示。此中醖釀。實爲世界經濟會議當前之巨大暗礁。亦即國際合作之唯一危機也。</p>
<p>至於通貨安定。在勢在理。宜爲各國所贊同。設使會議席上。能得一共通結論。歸而見諸實行。亦示始非資本主義各國之福。經濟恐慌。或可得到喘息之良機。然而全世界之現金總額。約計不過一百二十億美金。其中美法兩國。即據有三分之二。計數約在八十億美金以上。此項現金。目前皆藏諸金庫。表面上雖爲測度一切物價之標準尺。而寳際則與法定紙幣等耳。旣乏流通作用。又有能調整偏枯。今美國旣脫離金本位。進而採取通貨膨脹政策。法則爲維持其在歐指導地位。主張即行减低通貨平價。實行安國際匯兌率。因此美法對立尖銳。益難調和。而國際間經濟關係之癌腫。亦於焉張大矣。頃者美國代表於英美法三國會談通貨安定問題之際。聲明美國政府認通貨絕對安定之方策。須共同商酌。暫時的通貨安定之協定。如果成立。則經濟會議之前途。不免蒙受影響。美國政府認此舉爲不適於今日之時宜。且與美國提高物價之舉。頗有妨碍。於是世界經濟會議。大受震撼。其間尤與法國即時安定通貨之主張相背馳。向之國際間善作樂觀者。至此亦頓陷於悲觀矣。</p>
<p>然則美國何以不積極圖謀際間之合作。以打開當前之難局耶。蓋美國自身之困難甚多。如擁有一千二百餘萬之失業工人。如生產日趨過剩。如農產物價低落等等。皆足陷金圓。王國於極度困境中。本年三月之金融恐慌。迄今猶覺慄慄危懼。若順應國際情勢。容納英法要求。則美國自身。因貨敝</p>
<p>價値之機定。足使通貨膨脹政策。失其在國内之作用。一般物價。將因而下跌。於是美國數月以來。努力於定國内市場之工作。將師泡影。故至此不得不</p>
<p>國示其國家根本政策。在先圖自國經濟穩定。然後再推及於世界。此誠有其苦心在也。</p>
<p>惟以吾人觀察。此種國家主義之發展。適足以增進世界之混沌耳。第一美國否定通貨安定成立國際協定之結果。必將惹起維持金本位各國之之反感。則歐洲與美國之對立。將更趨嚴重。第二。資本主義發達至於今日。已至最高形趨。其有機的結構。異常複雜。金融恐慌之最大原因即爲對產業界投資不能限時收回。國内國外皆陷於資金凍結狀態同時又有存欵過多之感在善於運用資本之英國尚能勉强撑持不致發生甚大破綻而美於對外投資及消貨市塲。均缺乏充分把握故堅持國家主義之結果徒然此起國陳的安國内物價。亦僅能暫時上升而第三·通貨而不得安定關稅協定勢難實現且報復關稅以限制外貨之輸入更所難免。於是海外市塲。將愈窄狹經濟恐慌。更見深化即使國内一般物價暫時高漲。而失業問題。依然不得解决。一般社會消費能力。亦難增高。實際上之補益有此三因美國實行提高自已</p>
<p>物價而置通貨安定於不顧。豈得策哉。</p>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>怎樣奮鬭？</p>
<p>屈服呢？還是繼續奮鬭？</p>
<p>丨浙江何君來信丨</p>
<p>欽警的先生：</p>
<p>恕我的愚笨，明知在普遍的恐慌之下，整個的社會病態之中，一些個人的局部的問題是無由得到滿意的解答的·况每讀先生給許多讀者的解答，也有，「···希望從大處着想，爲羣奮門，生路自然也就有·」但是，欽敬的先生，請你不怕麻煩，進而再給我一個較具體的答復吧，我是孤零而愚笨得可憐的孩子呀！</p>
<p>爲解答便利，恕我靦然地來一個自我介紹，你不覺得討厭嗎？我是浙西一個四十萬人口的小鎭上的貧苦青年，除了出世那年是光榮的中華民國誕生日而外，自幼就在悽苦的空氣裹。特别是所謂赫赫朱門，世代書香到了「式微」時代，還在「塲面」下掙扎，比起一光二凈的流民游丐，生涯是更要不堪的。但，這凄風苦雨有吃没穿的生活下，我還能半工半讀地畢業了兩處小學一處中學。也因此頗蒙敎師們的熱情，代繳一切費用外，還給我些獎證，博得胼胝於牛馬生活中的父母以慰安。接着，我自已求荐，在湖州絲織廠幹起藝徒的生活來。學的是織物圖案，每月有四角小洋的月規·同時替文藝　寫點稿，或替一般人寫寫畫畫·有微些進益，又請准廠長每天抽出三小時作爲自修的時間。這樣整整三年。末後一年，又接受青年晨報社等的特約撰稿的任務，同時又兼了保衛團的書記，那年又嘗味了報社新聞編輯的生活。白天是工人，夜裹去編稿剪黏，清晨又去「奉此等因。」每天只有四小時的睡眠時間，結果，把苦守三年的工廠職位丢了，幸已略有幾塊錢的儲蓄，不致影響家庭。自顧孤零的孩子，就這樣出賣童年，也不堪長此受社會的壓榨。我是多麽脆弱呀，可是，我心頭的烈火早已燃起，反抗的血液已經沸騰了，這是革命的情緒政治的自覺！呵！我永久是這樣脆弱，脆弱的孩子嗎？永遠呻吟在惡魔的牙縫中嗎？不！不！民國十九年的春天，我已考進浙江省立的軍校，直到二十年的夏天，被派到浙邊開化，在那濠嶺白沙關頭，展開我軍官生涯的第一頁。雖有種種實際的苦惱，終不能阻止我理想的前程，接着被命令到關外江西懷玉山頭去剿匪，便以獨能全師進出戰地而補實了少尉排長以至中尉·其後調到㩴常，江山；跋涉風雪迷漫的仙霞嶺，出發到福建的仙陽，浦城，江西的廣豐時，已是赫然的上尉了。「細皮白肉，兩頰飛紅，酒渦兒深深地，姑娘樣兒的！這樣年青青的官長，帶兵的官長我們生來就没有見過！」「眞是時代變了！這軍官怕不是女孩子？咳！革命軍！」「你們不曉得，咱們的排長眞　的性格兒！不抽香烟，不賭錢，不喝酒，終日裹唸唸書，寫寫文章。哼！搆成火綫的當兒，你們可不會相信拉！他簡直瘋狂般飛躍着，意外的一聲丨丨上刺刀！衝鋒！殺那尖劈的口令下面，號音起了，刀光閃了，風也大了，我們都不由的跟着他飛衝前進了呢！···」欽敬的先生，你道我此後的生活，便轉向較有意義較可作爲的一面了嗎？不！不！原來我們浙江的省軍，說起來還差强人意；其實也和做買賣的機關差不多！軍人和市僧不相上下·槍膛裹有的是無告的寃魂，斜皮帶比妓女的月經布更要藏穢納污！說起來軍人身家念輕，最重義氣·其實也太理想了！說起來軍人生活最痛快·可是，在純潔青年，倒不要這種痛快！不過，我總算是統御着一百多名弟兄的軍官了，是爲着什麽來的呢？當然不忍也不會同流合污而要實施我的理</p>
<p>想的。第一步，把本隊的歷史弄清楚，因知本連是方振武那邊俘過來的。他們是「北　，」和以南人爲骨幹的省軍比較，可說是出類拔萃的在軍紀和作戰力上表現。我就立志把這一連攪出個意義來。所以第二步是行了些智力測騐，心理測騐，造成幾種可紀念的表格。第三步就</p>
<p>下手爲感情的團結，生活狀態的改良，社會國</p>
<p>家思想的認識·至此，雖只短四個月期間，我們只漸漸感到家人般親誠，而旁的營連就大不安靜起來了。淞滬血戰，我們加緊訓練·一天，我正在公共運動塲演講，突然團長的勤務兵··「報告團長請！」我方照例踱進閱報室，門口突然一陣上刺刀的聲浪，好像告訴我已被監禁了·一會兒，我接到營部的指令··「···乂乂調乂連，遺缺由乂乂補乂乂調乂乂連，乂乂連乂乂乂辭職照准···「我什麽時候辭職的？但，什麽也不容我說·後來，乂副官給我的消息··「前幾天營長不是和你談起，軍隊的飯也吃穿」</p>
<p>了，想丢了不幹的話嗎？那就是團長呌他來，請你自動辭職呀·他們有的說你有某種嫌疑，他就此報了你一個撤職查辦·其實，團長一向是很敬愛你的少年英俊，有意提拔你·而你反違衆情，說他落伍。可是，他至今還很看重你。愛你。樣請你看看報，就算查辦了并且指令上祇說「辭職照准」，使你那一連辦了并且指過。保全你以往的光輝····」這天團長替我擺了一桌送别酒，夜裹，營連長們都來作酒錢行，不知他們在閙着什麽一套戲。明天一早，他們換了便衣，靜悄悄地送我上西安古城的汽車。一刹那，砲竹齊鳴，軍號停止時，乂乂連的士兵站好了隊，他們的代表棒出一樣物件報告··「這眞是出乎意外的！昨天來了新連長，營」</p>
<p>長行「佈達式」，知道我們的老官長竟是辭職了！走了？走！唉！這不知是什麽一回事？我們都不明白，我們的官長好没端由的會丢了我們！他和好多弟史們在淌涙了。我們很不願意</p>
<p>官長就這樣不明不白的走了！而命令不得不服從，甚至我們的排長班長都調了！走了！更不知是什麽意思？爲了我們一向没閙亂子吧！我們五個月没有關餉了，官長當賣了被服開伙食，這樣的官長竟是會辭職的，丢了我們的！我們要怎樣綫好呢？你長官今天走了，我們不</p>
<p>知那一天是走的日子！我們要盡一點心，怱怱地奉上這「光照萬里」等四個字，只算盡了一點心，不成意思！我們不願意長官這樣走的，我們大家不願意！但又挽留不住！我們何日再聽指揮呢？就請臨别訓話！」好久好久，我就在他們含涙下死勁的敬禮中，老百姓驚疑嘈雜中，砲竹軍號聲中，團副官低聲和車夫一句，丨丨鳴！·····此脫離了軍隊了。這是去年四月的事。我雖放心不下我那一連，但已給零落地分割了。那時我不得不回家，二年間爲了我的讀書，從軍，没一箇錢寄回，窮得更不像樣了。父親失業回家，已四年，一味怨尤。老母縫衣，不堪養活一家。家庭便在驚風駭濤中，</p>
<p>終日爭吵。簿有桑地百多畝，荒而且還無力耕種。我這回歸家，也曾試耕過，可惜，不到幾月，此地墾好，那邊不又苗了！又没施肥，并没有持久的氣力。養蠶結果，合家人都力乏而病。僅有蠶繭又没人要。我是不怕生活惡劣的，任勞怨，耐飢寒，又是在軍中習慣了。可是刺激太多太深，也變得多病了！我卿生活程度雖不甚高，但現在一家五人恃爲生活的，是十多間房租金每月共四元，不說痛苦，也該多病了！我總算作戰多次，目擊戰區民衆的慘狀。並且也常是貴報的讀者，得稍見世界大勢和國家現狀。區區一身一家的慘苦，原也不當一會事。我還想「從大處着想，爲羣奮鬥」，犧牲身家。去年某地某君等組織國民自動抗日救國會，就去加入，訓練二月。雖結果被解散，而其中頗多熱誠愛國青年，我們爲不願這團結的力量就此完結，因又成立了少年勵志社。并分設了業餘讀書會和救國鋤奸團。那　時戴季陶在吳興，我們鑒於他天仇時代的辦報成績，值得訪問；多承他贊助我們組織現代報社。可惜結果以經濟和立案審查問題而流產了。接着，我們因爲社友的增多，便又計劃向鄉村進展，先後創立農民夜校，農餘樂園，和立志私小。但是我們多係貧苦青年，大家傾其所</p>
<p>有，還愁後讀不繼，社會不但毫無援助，反多由冷眼而間接加我以打擊。乂乂原來從一般人看來，我們這些小子，犧牲金錢，時間，來辦無名可享無利可獲的事，當然是别有作用啦！可憐我們勉强支持到今年一月，把賠錢的學校</p>
<p>停了。救國鋤奸團的彈丸，雖曾呌社會注意，也以經濟困難而結束，徒留下擲彈時那可愛的</p>
<p>回憶。理想太高，計劃徒詳，實力有限一，無「强」而有力的後台老板，雖有許多　血青年的共同奮鬥，也徒然使青年純潔的心，多受一次</p>
<p>打擊。我呢，咬緊牙根，犧牲身家　决志，也徒然飽經艱苦，力絀心瘁；只算多了一次經騐。當然，到此地步，我那可憐的家庭，仍是張開了創痕斑駁的雙翼，迎接我這　羽歸來的小鳥的。但，家庭環境一天不如一在，我又怎忍久累他呢？何况實際上也不能久往下去，我又覺得已往的失敗，只是方法的不當，並不是青年不能「爲羣奮鬥」。這次，我决定我的野征。目標是：到抗　日前線去，丨丨至少，我是有點作戰經騐的。搭火車去，金錢第一個不答允。坐海船，也得十多塊錢才可到北平。所以，决心步行北上。第一次是合夥五人。但是没有達到目的。第次行到半途，只剩我一人。到鎭江，便被公安局看做神經病，被押遂回來。第三次總算到達南京，但因得友助十元返滬坐海輪，却不幸連買票也不夠。第四次步行到浦口，茫茫石頭城下水，無錢不能渡。雖然想盡方法，只能跑回浙江。第五次在家苦苦地刮到幾塊錢，可是半途又病倒了！脚病寸步不能行。而消息傳來，自然河失陷至停戰約定成立。我那野征北上的美夢，經這四個月的流離艱苦，又受了加倍的欺凌和侮辱，終又幻滅了。被慈善的送到上海，在北站給失意在滬的軍校同學某君看見，他就典押了他的大衣，送我回家。</p>
<p>這是一星期前的事。現在舉目皆非，往事不堪回首。以往的我，不是在盲從胡閙嗎？將來又怎樣呢？我的野征，原是求一較有意義的自殺。但，現在，自殺也非呌我卑怯地向傳統地跳水和其他老路去不可！欽敬的先生！嚕囌地寫來，不是累你看得厭倦了嗎？恕我文筆的拙劣，尤其在沉重的脚爛病中，不能說得委宛些簡潔些。</p>
<p>現在，歸納成幾個主題，請求答復：</p>
<p>㈠像我們這樣幼稚淺薄，尤其是没背景靠山，連自身生活也困難而徒具一點堅志滿腔熱誠的青年，要從大體着想，努力爲羣奮門，究屬可能否？</p>
<p>㈡爲羣奮鬥，當從何下手？去創造環境？去加入旣成集團？</p>
<p>（若加入旣成集團，向何處去？怎樣去法？）</p>
<p>㈢民氣消沉極了，疲倦極了，正義不張，一切口頭文字的呼喊是不中用了！我們要怎樣啊？㈣我們社襄有許多熱血青年，他們都曾立志爲社會國家爲羣衆奮鬥，他們確曾犧牲遇相當的時間，心力金錢和名譽。但幾經社會的打擊，都已疲乏了，懈忘了，他們已是無法挽救了嗎？我們不必喚醒他們繼續更猛烈的衝進？㈤顯然的，我的家庭是那樣的窮苦可哀，但她還能收容我這負創歸來的「不肖子」！他們希望我能繼續奮鬥，他們實在渴盼我以後能掙錢救家，父母是老了。丨丨我呢，明知整個的未解决，一身一家的事終無圓滿的解答，而志於爲羣奮鬥，那末，我現在在家吮吸老母的血汗，（她並血誠地服侍我）究竟說得過去嗎？這可哀的家庭的負擔，可以抛棄丨丨棄家庭於不顧嗎？</p>
<p>（我的家有父母，姊，寄弟四人）</p>
<p>㈥在這樣環境中的我，究可爲羣奮鬥嗎？</p>
<p>㈦我的意思，整個社會問題未解决，我們對於哀然無歸的家庭，仍是要想相當的負責。但，我將怎樣去負責呢？丨丨這是說有了錢什麽也不成問題啊！我的爲人，就是百計去掙錢？</p>
<p>㈧現在，我已到了水盡山窮的地步，該屈服而自殺呢？該存萬一的希望而去求生活？爲羣奮鬥和個人求生不衝突嗎？</p>
<p>㈨我按自已的淺薄的經騐和拙劣的技術，自信還能擔任：抄寫；書記；小學敎員；家庭敎師；織物圖案：美術圖案；新聞編輯；校對；小品撰述；軍學軍事敎練；築城；　關於軍事戰術，社會，鄉付生活，勞動者生活，婦女生活，土風，等調查，專著，叙述等事務。並能任勞怨，耐苦艱，生活不妨十分低劣，但求每日有四小時的自修時間。不知現在可有這種需要？恕我這樣打攪你！</p>
<p>㈩我們軍校同學三百多人，現在百分之九十都失業了，有時相見，各以孤憤相告，大半是彷徨着。這何嘗不是社會的隱患？我不知道，國</p>
<p>家政府爲什麽要開這樣的軍官和政治學校，每年製造出這多的軍官和新貴族，丨丨這些失業軍官，國家政府是絕不顧問的！我跑遇軍官學校，眼看趾高氣揚的軍學生，不覺悲痛欲絕。欽敬的先生丨以上說得多了，但，也許不祗是我一已所要說的。　誠然願意碰破頭皮，懇求你給我一個切實的答復，具體的方法。同時我一已所要說的。我誠然願意碰破頭皮，懇求　你給我一個切實的答復，具體的方法。同時，</p>
<p>還希望你特别想法向那裹討點篇幅，刋載出來，并你的答案。困爲，我們不少同其情形的同學，一樣盼望着哪！</p>
<p>最後，謝你不怕煩的看完，請你靜靜不息一下。你這時的一秒一分間的思想，足以使好多青年可憐地卑怯地自殺，也足以使好多青年興奮地愼重地，繼續更奮鬥。相信你决不會使我們失望的吧。</p>

<h3>本埠</h3>
<p>本市中學會考昨日續試大部份考竣續考者三十一校未考者二十二校丨潘敎局長痛述詳情丨</p>
<p>本市中學畢業會考原於本月十五日起舉行三天</p>
<p>、旋以十七日最後一日高中第一第三試場發生洩題紛擾情形市敎局宣告暫行停考並通知未考完竣之高初中學於昨日由會考委員會分别　派員携卷赴各中學試塲續試期可考竣以告結束、惟昨日尚有一小部份學校未曾參加續試其情形異常複雜、上海社記者特趨訪市敎局潘局長叩詢詳情、當承延見並發表談話如下</p>
<p>潘局長謂、本局奉敎育部令舉辦中小學畢業會考、小學部份業已完全考竣中學部份以本月十七日高中第一第三兩試塲發生洩顯紛擾問題致未結束、除洩題事情由局偵查已有端倪　送司法機關嚴訊法辦外、並由會考委員會次定呈准敎育部定今日（二十四日）續試各校大部份學生俱早已準備</p>
<h3>希望考試</h3>
<p>按本屆中學部份參加會考學生總計三千三百餘人、於十七日考竣者已有初中兩試塲學生六百人、其餘初中有一科、及高中有一科或三科未考者合計五十三校、學生二千餘人今日遵令參加補試者計有滬江附中、持志附中南洋模範中學復旦實中初中部、敬業中學務本女中青年中學、正風中學等三十一校學生一千二百餘人、總計此次高初中學生參加會考終　者、共約一千八百餘人業已</p>
<h3>超過半數</h3>
<p>尙有二十二校今日未曾參與續試、而此二十二校中未參加續試之原因異惜複雜據各監試人員來局報告、如民立中學裨文女中、復旦實中高中部清心女中業餘校學生俱準備人塲應試因被他校學生糾察隊之包圍威嚇、致</p>
<p>[P欲考不得&gt;</p>
<p>且民立中學學生當塲自動集合、簽名表去請予補考者有四十餘人之多、以少數學生之搗亂、至無法應試、他如光華附中中西女中、以學校當局早先放假、任令學生離校學生故亦無從應試再如復旦附中、以學校舉</p>
<p>行畢業典禮學生同時不能參加續考尙有一部份學生有受敎師暗示者有抱觀望態度者其、故意搗亂不參加續考者、僅佔極少數惟、</p>
<h3>最可惋惜</h3>
<p>者、聞有數大學附屬中學學校當局向學、生宣稱不參加會考之畢業證書他處如不能升學可直接升入本大學學生以不</p>
<p>知將來敎部對於是項升學資格未必予以承認故皆盲從、卽有少數學生知此情形者學校當局以事後再可向敎部交涉安慰學生、在此情形下、學生自樂於避考吾人應知學生參加畢業會考、乃關係學生各人本身之事、不能以他人之强制而自誤前途此點深望學生、</p>
<h3>家長注意</h3>
<p>至本人對於學生方面、頗能原諒、深知其處境之困難㈠以試題洩漏案一時憤激懷疑敎局之不澈究而使然㈡以環境之壓迫、多方之誘導而使然今日未能全體一律參加續試、本人事前早已料及亦祇能聽之惟敎局對於此次不參加續考之學生、當分别情節、</p>
<h3>酌擬辦法</h3>
<p>請示敎部辦理、其故意搗亂並聚衆挾制他生不參加續考之學生自當另</p>
<p>予處置、其自願補試者或可仍予以補試之機會、關於已考　生之試卷數日内卽可評閱完竣定期公佈云、</p>
<h3>試題洩漏查有端倪</h3>
<p>本市中學會考、澈究高</p>
<p>中一部份試題洩漏事宜聞敎局日前已查有頭緒、除建國中學有若干預得試題之學生及職員某君已拖解法院候訊外潘局長以爲敎局掌管監督印題及裝訂試題之職員、職責所關、亦有偵查之必要故昨已解送六人、請地方法院首席檢察官嚴密偵查據稱因在法院偵查程序中姓名均尚不便公布以免有碍進行云、</p>
<h3>升學指導運動週閉幕</h3>
<p>昨爲女學日中華職業敎育社上海職業指導所舉行之升舉指導運動週、　日爲女學日亦爲最後之一日、天氣晴朗、故來賓較前兩日爲多、總計上下午來賓約七百餘人、下午由光明熱水瓶公司分贈、到會　　　紙扇、茲將上下午各情探誌如下、</p>
<p>演　情形上年九時舉行演講主庸潘仰究致組會　繼由女子職業敎育家　印石君中西女　陸規亮君演　、下午四時由　　　君主席、博文女學校長黃紹　務本女學師範部主任徐元璞二女士演講、</p>
<p>部氏演詞略　我們辦職業敎育的人、要指導女子合於社會　要的出略、使女子得自由去</p>
<p>選擇與本身性情相近的職業去給、社會服務、像文書議士速記　桑美折機繡刺繼續紉等科、都是　宜於女子而合於社會需要的職業敎育、希望女子各個於受舉校敎育時、先就得抱定不移的宗旨、去尋自已的出路、努力前進去造成一個自我獨立的人云云、</p>
<p>陸氏演詞略言、中西女熟大槪情形學生家庭、雖有富裕清寒之别、而服用起居、均能崇尚實際、次言青年大多數的習氣、低夾外表、腦筋雖　、雙手却不能實地去做、雖女子的弊病、有</p>
<p>異於男子但每多易於恢心生氣、須加以修養功失、并舉勤樂愛信四字、爲青年男女求學立身之箴規、缺一不可、然後方得享生存之樂云云</p>
<p>黃氏講詞題爲「女子求學之理想標準」、略謂、㈠敎育之原則、一、人與獸之辨點、㈡敎育之方法、一須順應環境、㈡、須改善環境、㈢女子</p>
<p>之人生觀、一、常道的爲女爲妻爲母此中又分直接的有裨益社會間接的去與聞政治、二非常道的爲投身社會或與聞政洽、㈣過渡時代的女子一方面的負荷家政、他方面的因家庭經濟艱難、而服務社會、㈤女子求學之標準可分三方面講、一、考慮自已的個性斟酌環境决擇職業珍惜光陰改良習慣這樣把智能充實了不會羨虚榮、而抺煞眞美二讀書扼要之點是要有自信心自反心守禮心、負責心把德性堅定了未有不敬業樂羣的、三、生活有秩序、運動適體格才能使體格健全綜括以上所言、女子都能照此標準去求學、則家室和平社會安寗國家順治世界大同、此卽爲女學進化後之福利亦即樂生之道云云、</p>
<p>徐氏講詞略謂、㈠經濟問題、處於這種私有財產制度之下、同時又受着世界經濟的壓迫生產落伍的中國社會、只有中產階級的子弟才有受中等敎育的機會、而這種機會又被男子佔了</p>
<p>優先權、所以這便是阻碍女子升學的困難點㈡婚姻問題、女了往往在求學的中途爲了環境與</p>
<p>家庭的關係、便發生了婚姻問題、於是女子便爲婚姻以後的家庭犧牲了、她的前程所以這是阻碍女子升學的困難第二點、㈢健康問題女子年齡逐漸增加體力、便逐漸减退所以高中以上的</p>
<p>女子、大半的學力、不及於男子這是身體上阻碍女子升學的又一點㈣男女學校相差的懸殊並加以許多的比例二女士、講詞中肯男女學生及聽衆、大受感動而四B來之升學指導運動亦在夕陽西墜裙屐雜沓結束矣、</p>

<p>梁綠珠與何　兒</p>
<p>梁綠珠是古代的珠娘，何　兒是現代的珠娘，　綠珠爲着被刦而墜樓身死，伺　兒爲着失戀而墜樓身死，青樓中多烈性女子，這呌做「醴泉無源，芝草無根。」</p>
<p>綠珠死後，博白地方留下了許多古跡，有綠樓，有綠珠江，有綠珠井；對於綠珠總算是極端崇拜的了。何　兒死後，香港地方，果能似崇拜綠珠般的崇拜　兒麽？唉！不見得，不見得，貞烈破產的時代，一般都是墜樓人，然而社會上的觀察，大不相同了。</p>
<p>何　兒在宜番察做妓女時，芳名喚做盼如君。據人傳稱。　兒初改芳名，喚做盼元君，後因粤音讀元如誾，盼元君彷佛盼閻君，大有「不祥莫大焉一的意想；旋即改爲盼如君，含有盼望如意郎君的志願，後來認　了中山　某，志在從良，事垂成而忽生阻力，盼如君便追隨綠珠的芳蹤，從三層樓一躍下地，斷盤骨二，臂骨一，脅骨若干；送往國家醫院，卽夕便已香銷玉殞。鄭某悼念前情，泣不可仰；出八百金，作棺殮費，卜　鷄　灣，從此一坯黃土，又要供遊人的臨風憑弔了。</p>

<h3>吳老老的奇語</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>前幾天，吳老老稚暉到湖南去，路過漢上，談起他對國　的感想，共分兩段，報載原文已忘，大略是說中國漢奸甚多，　可爲扼腕丨蔣作賓公使在日本時，曾問幣　前外相，日本爲了何故要侵略中國？幣原說：中國到日送禮的人甚多，且禮甚重，日本如何不接受？幣原並引例爲證。又說中國老年人皆</p>
<p>應槍斃，爲的老人不會製槍砲；於是勸少年人趕快覺悟救國以免到了老年，又入於應槍斃之列；似乎吳本人亦自承應槍斃。這兩種說法，都有點奇妙不可異議。第一，幣原所謂到日送禮的人，當然就是吳所謂可爲扼腕的漢奸了，我們不信在青白旗下，竟有駕乎舊日曹陸章以上把東北四省土地作爲禮物送到日本的漢奸；即俴有，幣原又怎肯坦然說出？而我們的蔣公使更何至有這樣直率的質問？這也罷了。吳又說老年人不會製槍砲，便應槍斃，青年纔有救國的可能和資格：這我們檢查事實，卻大大不然，而且相反的，古今中外當國的人物，有幾個是青年青年呢？事實上卻是白髪蕭蕭，老當益壯者居多。即以這回的國難而論，斷送東北的是老年人呢還是青年？英皇對於中國有青年上將，統兵數十萬，專就沒胡年紀輕的任上將，英國升至上將的，年紀都在五十以外。」中國也曾有親歷甲午之役的老年人自已承認没有對後一輩竭力宣傳的失責，並不曾因爲不會製槍砲，自已便脫然居於事外。何况救國不全仗槍砲；武力從事，不是我們中國人一致斥爲野蠻的麽？然則自</p>
<p>爲什麽全仗槍砲呢？</p>

<p>最反嘉興城裹發生一件巡官抬轎的笑話，有一位紳士的閨閣千金，在路上行走，警察老爺兩眼昏花，把嬌滴滴的女千金，當作賣笑的娼妓，拘入局中。紳士大發雷霆，非打破這位冒失巡官飯碗不可：後　人緩頰，罰巡官用轎將小姐抬回。巡官一變而爲轎夫，屈尊就卑，大抬其轎，手段之高明，必超轎夫　上之，不過巡官抬轎子，確是千載逢的機會，紳士千金的福澤，可謂不淺哩！本國的俗語，大凡在賭局里，甲乙兩個賭客，互通消息，暗算同已局之人，也謂之抬轎子。坐轎朋友的幸運，從此就受轎夫的支配。可憐復可笑！反是，中華地大物博，抬轎方式，决不止渺乎其小這幾種。社會的不景氣，魑魅魍魎，稍一不察，轎夫隨時有施其抬轎可能。帝國主義侵略失地千里，猶高唱不抵抗高調三島轎夫，焉得不乘機而抬，大獲其利。</p>
<p>唉！一息尙存的民族，若還不自警惕，一羣洋種的轎夫，正虎視眈眈。待時而動，坐轎的機會，將永無止境了。</p>

<h3>兒童新智識</h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>眠睡</p>
<p>我們在春夏之交，最喜歡睡眠所謂春眠不覺曉一一名話，就是說「熟睡」的意思，因爲在春夏兩季相交的時候，温度大　在摄氏十七八度上下，這温度，與我們人體是最適宜的而且在這季節不論　物興趣與室内外運動，比較其他委節　快樂，所以熟睡不容易醒了。可是睡眠爲人類生理的必然現象，白天活動疲勞，到了夜間經過睡眠後就可以回復身體上的健康，然而人類應當睡眠幾　時間呢？照普通的習慣，大槪是七八小時，但是也有因人而不同的，有的祗睡眠了五六小時已能回復疲勞的，　如拿破侖平日睡眠祗四五小時，因爲他的四五小時，可以抵當八九小時的效果。爲什麽呢？原來睡眠，有一熟睡」與一淺睡的分别，熟睡四五小時，已能把一切疲勞，充分的回復，倘若睡眠時，常受鶩動而不能深人夢境，心驚肉跳，夢魂顚倒，那雖然睡眠十數小時，也無益的。普通的人，就眠後一二時内，最爲熟睡，到了天將明時，已漸漸的變爲淺睡，但是有一種人，就眠時，輾反側的不能人睡，到了天明</p>
<p>時，則熟睡不易醒了。這天明熟睡的習慣，是非常有害的·所以我們平常要使夜間熟睡，第一應當有適當的運動，因爲白天經過愉快的運動，自然會熟睡了，可是過於運動，反而不能安眠，第二就眠以前，須避刺激性的飲食物，曁如濃茶，咖啡，等不可進口，電影戲劇等也富於刺激的不可多看，第三睡眠時不可點强烈的燈，室内壁上，也不可裝飾紅色的東西，總之，我們平常能睡眠七八小時，最爲適當，能　熟睡，就是六七小時已足，但是切不可多睡，因爲多睡，就要發生嗜眠性腦炎哩。</p>
<p>閒食</p>
<p>般小孩們，每天最喜歡閒食尤其是喜歡吃甜　的果物，可是規則不正的閒食，常常減少正當的主食分量，因爲無一定時間，不可拘分量的閒食，徒然供我們的口慾，妨碍身發達引起危險的疾病。平常我們的正黨食事·一矢三次已足，不過在乳兒期内，一日三次主食所得的營養分，是不十分充足，所以不得不給與閒食以補助之，等到七八歲以後憲當逐漸廢除閒食。况且街巷所賢的不衛生的食物，是傳染病的媒介，而無定量的亂食，旣害胃腸的消化，又減少原有的營養分。閒食中最宜注意的，譬如豆類，是最容易發生腸加答兒，小豆花生爲痢疾的誘導品，鹽餅蜜糕損害胃的吸收力，特近來的各式糖果，含有過量的亞硫酸，阻碍酸素，污染血液，所以我們過了乳　兒期以後，切不可貪口舌的慾，恣意閒食，隊三次主食外，不論何物，應當廢除，而且在小孩時代，幼小偏食或甜或鹹的果物，漸漸的養成偏食的習償，等到年長，就不容改除了。</p>
<p>屋住</p>
<p>大凡貴族式的家庭都是高樓大厦極不適合小孩們住居的，因爲對於小孩們性格的敎育，健康的保持遊戲的適宜應當具有下列各種條件就是第一要與兩親和保護者，能够顧到而接近的。第二房屋的位置以朝東南方，與日光和衛生有利益的。第三遊戲室寢室便所要在近傍　。第四應設有捺抺的板，公便兒童們自由寫作的。第五室内壁上，應有寫實的繪畵。第六床舖容易收拾整理，睡眠又極便利的。第七窗户要大而低，以便向外眺覽的。照以上理想的條件言之。兒童們的住屋，祇要兩間就很適意了，倘若過於大不但照願不到，就是起居行動也很不方便啊。</p>

<h3>談蝙蝠</h3>
<p>— 游光</p>
<p>人們對於夜裹出來的動物，總不免有些討厭他，大約因爲他偏不睡覺，和自已的習慣不同，而且在昏夜的沉睡或微行「中怕他會窺見什麽秘密罷。蝙蝠雖然也是夜飛的動物，但在中國的名譽却還算好的。這也並非因爲他呑食蚊䖟，於人們有益，大半倒在他的名目，和「福」字同音。以這麽一副尊容而</p>
<p>能寫入畵圖，實在就靠着名字起得好。還有，　是中國人本來願意自已能飛的，也設想過别的東西都能飛。道士要羽化，皇帝想飛昇，有情的願作比翼鳥兒受苦的恨不得挿翅飛去。想到老虎添翼，便毛骨聳然，然而青蚨飛來，則眉眼莞爾。至於墨子的飛鳶終於失傳，飛機非募欵到外國去購買不可，則是因爲太重了精神文明的綠故，勢所必至，理有固然，毫不足怪的。但雖然不能夠做，却能夠想，所以見了老鼠似的東西生着翅子，倒也並不詫異，有名的文人還要收爲詩料，謅出什麽「黃昏到寺蝙蝠飛」那樣的佳句來。西洋人可就没有這麽高情雅量，他們不喜歡蝙蝠。推源禍始，我想，恐怕是應該歸罪於伊索的。他的寓言裹，說過島獸各開大會，蝙蝠到獸類裹去，因爲他有翅子，獸類不收，到鳥類裹去，又因爲他是四足，鳥類不納，弄得他毫無立場，於是大家就討厭這作爲象徵的蝙蝠了。</p>
<p>中國近來拾一點洋古典，有時也奚落起蝙蝠來。但這種寓言，出於伊索，是可喜的，因爲他的時代，動物學還幼稚得很。現在可不同了，鯨魚屬於什麽類，蝙蝠屬於什麽類，就是小學生也都知道得清清楚楚。倘還拾一些希臘古典，來作正經話講，那就只足表示他的知識，還和伊索時候，各開大會的兩類紳士淑女們相同。</p>
<p>大學敎授梁實秋先生以爲橡皮鞋是草鞋和皮鞋之間的東西，那知識也相仿，假使他生在希臘，位置是說不定會在伊索之下的，現在眞可惜得很，生得太晚一點了。</p>
<h3>時代的特寫</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>在電影裹有所謂「特寫」）Closeup（,就是將某一細部特别地擴大,或將某一過程變更了時間性,前者如將一雙淚眼</p>
<p>擴大到整幅銀幕,後者如將雨點弄得異常緩慢地落到荷葉上面。要講道理是講不通的，天下决没有如此其大的眼睛，如此其慢的雨點，這幾乎是再荒唐没有的事，但在觀衆當時并不會想到牠荒唐，反而覺得彷彿應該如此的。文藝創作上也是如此，往往將某一重要部分寫的特别詳細，或把形容詞用的「過甚其事」，這例子每篇作品裹都可找得到，無庸多說。</p>
<p>現在這時代和社會，也正在「特寫」。</p>
<p>不信你看，大資本家在一分鐘裹要收入到幾百幾千元，工人整年汗流夾背還不及資本家一天裹一分鐘的收入。有錢人生活的驕奢淫逸，貧窮人生活的饑寒困苦。這許許多多社會的「特寫」，幾乎不能想像得出來，然而這時代正不停地在「特寫」，而且天天在深化這「特寫」。我們若把現社會的「特寫」毫不加潤飾地忠實地介紹到銀幕上的時候，我怕大家一定以爲這祇是銀幕上的「特寫」，不會相信這確確實實是時代的「特寫」了！現在這時代和社會的「特寫」，更比電影或文藝的「特寫」發展到可驚的不合理。一般青年的所以迷惘，主要實是没有體騐到這時代的「特寫」。爲認識這時代和社會的「特寫」，應該生活在資本主義最尖端的大都會裹，在中國就是上海。</p>
<h3>狗和養狗的人們</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>�</p>
<p>近幾年來，狗運亨通，人們對於養狗的藝術都很注意，這世界便充滿了各色各樣的狗。</p>
<p>少時候，聽父老的傳說，天上有隻「天狗」，夜夜追逐著月亮，快將追上的時候，牠便用口含住，想呑下去，這便是月蝕。但天上的事情畢竟難以明瞭，當時也只胡亂聽了··後來到得上海，看了跑狗的把戲，才恍然明白，原來「玉皇大帝」「觀音菩薩」之流，也喜歡這一套。</p>
<p>我雖不知道「天狗」是否和我們日常所見的狗一個模樣，但我郤可以說，人間也就有許多狗是不亞於「天狗」的。</p>
<p>就說善於追逐的狗吧！我們在跑狗塲和田獵的地方常能見到；牠們有Beqgloshqrriers;whippet和sAfghan,BasserElk,Foxhounds等的分别，上海跑狗塲裹所有的，大都是Greyhounds.這此狗，聳起脊骨，餓癟肚子，活像清貧自守的「正人君子」；但說起來可眞是一幕悲劇，牠們拚命的追逐目的物，追上了，所飽的又决不是自已的肚子。這，就因爲牠們是狗。此外還有二種。一種是Lerriers.有Airedale,Bedlingon,Barder,CairnDaandieDinmont等的分别；一種是Setters專使偵察，也可分爲ЕnglishGordonSpaniels等類。這些狗，身材短小，郤非常機警，頗適宜於追逐和偵察野兎山狸等較小的動物；牠們工於鑽營，各處尋逐著來討主人的歡喜；牠們戴著猙獰的面具，有著靈敏的鼻子，兇狠險詐，這世界全是牠們的世界，弱小動物是鮮有能逃避牠們的嗅覺的。但牠們還不免是狗。</p>
<p>最後，我們要提到Toys了。所謂Toys者，魯迅先生所愛打的叭兒狗之流也。牠們也有許多種類，普通的像PoodlesGriffons,Pugs等，而咱們國產PoO牠們的形狀是介乎貓狗之間，以伶俐光澤的皮毛取悅於人；牠們没有特殊技能，不過生成一副小丑臉，慣會搖頭擺尾的獻殷勤，專供「有閒階級玩玩而已」女人們大都愛狗，特别是叭兒狗。跳舞塲，影戲院，汽車裹，馬路上，隨曉可以看見許多香噴噴的叭兒狗，跟在肥滿的屁股後面。至於闊人們所愛養的。郤是據說是舊俄羅斯種：那些東西並不機警，不過生得很是高大，看去似乎有些威風。所以有一輛汽車就得養一條狗。在用不着的時候，留在家裹，替太太小姐們解解悶氣，横堅終是狗。</p>
<p>最會巴結人的是狗：肯捨了性合被　人利用的也是狗，　見破　的衣裳便狺狺狂吠，告訴你窮人不准進高堂大厦的一番大道理的，不消說還是狗</p>
<h3>舊劇鑼鼓論新解</h3>
<p>— 羅復</p>
<p>何如先生在自由談裹論戲劇，說梅博士回答　翁「中國自有戲劇」</p>
<p>一物，即不離鑼鼓。·····以崑曲言何嘗不用鑼鼓』。他引了李笠翁論鑼鼓的話做他的例證，可惜他不能不說「笠翁此論發於崑曲没落之際』，是他這例證的最大的漏點。</p>
<p>『中國戲劇遠源出自角觝』，是中國戲劇史的三字經；『我國舊戲不廢武把子與鑼鼓』，是同於『角觝武術，須有金鼓以示進退而壯陣容』，也自是不易之論。但是角觝百戲何時纔和中國戲劇水</p>
<p>乳交融，鑼鼓何時纔正式闌入我國舊戲</p>
<p>裹來，何如先生却又不免將這些問題輕易放過了。</p>
<p>顧起元客座贅語論明代南都戲劇，很能夠替何如先生「舊戲鑼鼓論」進一新解。客座贅語說：</p>
<p>南都萬曆以前，公候與縉紳及富家，凡有讌會，小集多用散樂，或三四人，或多人唱大套北曲，樂器用筝𫃁，琵琵，三弦子，拍板：若大席則用　坊打院本·及北曲大四奮者·中間錯以撮　圈，舞觀音，或百文旗或跳隊子。後乃　爲　用南唱，歌　只一小拍板，或以扇子代之，間有用鼓板者，今則吳人益以洞　及月琴，聲調屢變，益悽惋，聽者殆欲墮涙矣使可知明萬曆前後，北曲南曲，全都不用鑼鼓。但這時却不是一亦有不用』像梅博士所說；正確些說，是「南曲最初不用鑼鼓』。</p>
<p>到後來，因爲有用鑼鼓的崑曲，像李笠翁論裹所說，於是纔和不用鑼鼓的崑曲取對立的形式。這例證並不難見，讀一讀紅樓夢，便可知博士之論不是假話了。</p>
<p>鑼鼓闌入舊戲是因爲角觝百戲和舊戲</p>
<p>交融，而成爲舊戲裹的武把子：但武把子還不曾和舊戲交融，只在「文戲」之外閒雜着撮墊圈····之類的解數，舊戲裹是不會有鑼鼓的，依何如先生的假定更成爲不可拔的理由。何况，現在的武把子雖也是舊戲裹的一分子了，但還是一種賣解的尾巴，很牽强地在舊戲裹活動着。何如先生旣承認鑼鼓是和武把子同時侵入舊戲，爲什麽又斷言『中國戲須用鑼鼓』，是『自有戲劇一物，即不離鑼鼓』，而不察知牠的襲來，和牠也正和武把子一樣是在舊戲裹面牽强活動呢？</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>阿斗們前途的自决</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>據昨日本報北平專電：「灤東僞軍：迄無辦法·日關東軍方面，仍取延宕態度，對我所提各項，迄無具體答覆，各叛逆近竟在灤東宣布獨立·希圖養成一種特殊勢力···」云云，蓋僞軍李際春郝鵬李青山等的背後是由日人操縱一切，自屬不成問題的事實。近來當局雖疊向日人交涉，請其遵照「停戰協定」，迅速撤兵，但是日人一面藉口我張家口事件未能解决，不允將灤東各屬完全交出，一面以僞軍爲假面具，自已不出面，假作痴聾，不聞不問，中國當局除了向日提出交涉外就一籌莫展，祇有焦慮而已。我們倘若稍留心這次所謂「停戰協定」的前因後果，看到目前這樣受人欺騙得可憐的情形，想到中華民族受壓迫的前途，我們是不是安心做阿斗，聽一班自命不凡而實屬不肖的諸葛亮成是姜維，去委屈求全，苟且偷安，維持鬼混的局面，還是應該自作打算，力圖振作，羣起注意我們所應注意的一切國家要政，大家組織起來外可作政府的有力後盾，内可監督政府的設施。我們深覺這種民衆力量若能從此逐漸演進的養成，實爲復興民族前途的一線曙光·我們有没有這種勇氣與决心羣向着這曙光的前程奔赴，是</p>
<p>有待於我們一班阿斗們的自决了！</p>
<p>記者寫到這裹，不覺忽然想起前天在電車上所聽見的一句話：算了罷！這個年頭·還是無聲無臭，安分守已的少年爲妙啊！」這句話是一位六十餘歲鬚髮斑白的老者，向着一位二十幾歲光景的少年朋友說的。至於那位少年所說的話，我可没有完全聽清楚，不過大意不外乎是談論近數月來，所聽到的許許多多綁票與暗穀的事件，尤其是如丁玲的失蹝，馬紹武的被殺以及大世界經理唐某及中央研究院總幹事楊銓的遭刺等事。觀那位少年的語氣，似乎是抱着無限的悲觀憤慨的神情，我曾聽見他最後有這樣幾句不連續的話，說：「這還成個世界嗎？丨中國人對於外國人則馴服如綿羊，對本國人則凶狠如豺狼，眞是令人氣憤！</p>
<p>我們相信與這位少年表同情的人一定是很多，但是我們更相信與那位老者表同情的人一定是更多更多，要多得不可勝數！因爲「安分守已」本是阿斗們習慣了的脾氣，至於悲觀，憤慨以及什麽組織起來。力圖振作，那却是易說而難行的事情，非阿斗們所優爲。不遇，救國救民族本是一件很難行很難做的工作。行見賣國，賣民族者，雖與敵人打成一片，來壓迫　殺與他們利害衝突者亦所不惜！阿斗們！你們還是避難就易，甘爲阿斗，還是寗爲爭自由爭主權而流血，不願「安分守已」做一個行屍走肉的人而苟活呢，這是全在你們自决了。</p>
<p>）生活（九個外婆家長空）穿西裝的窮朋友（在上海，老于穿西裝的窮朋友·大槪總不會不曉得虹口的那條「吳淞路」吧。在那裹，有一列列排陣似的許多小押當，就是我們窮朋友的寳庫：看待它，好像自已的外婆家。</p>
<p>這幾天，因爲欠着的房租和包飯作裹的飯費。已到了期，而身邊又一文不名，對於房東太太的冷的面孔，包飯作老板的惡的獰笑，實在寒心。祇得忍着痛，將一套穿過三個月的新西裝，送往外婆的寳庫裹去了！</p>
<p>將近外婆家，首先觸目的就是那懸在門口的幾套窮朋友無錢贖取而被没掉的舊西裝，在空中迎風飄蕩着。</p>
<p>我跨進了第一家典當的門口，把夾在腋下的衣包在櫃台上一放，裝出一副老於斯道的模樣。櫃台内的朝奉先生，就把衣包打開，提起上裝的頷口，四面反覆的觀察，再看褲子，再看背心後，就向我的面孔一打量說：</p>
<p>「當多少？」</p>
<p>「你說多少？」我反問着。</p>
<p>「兩塊錢。」</p>
<p>我聽了他嘴裹吐出「兩塊錢」三個字心中就抽了一口冷氣，想：媽的，你良心倒不狠！老子做這套衣服的時候化了三十五塊大洋錢呢。</p>
<p>「十塊錢來嗎？」</p>
<p>「哼丨不要丨」他好像已經看透找的心和我那副窮相了。</p>

<h3>時事研究世界經濟會議的前途</h3>
<p>— 侣</p>
<p>）時事研究（自經一九二九年開始而繼續了四年的世界經濟恐慌·已經把資本主義相對穩定的成果，不但摧毀得乾乾凈凈，而且恐慌的程度·更是一天一天的加深着··同時·社會主義國家蘇聯第一次五年計劃之于四年告成，奠定了牠的經濟基礎··使帝國主義國家内的勞苦大衆及</p>
<p>殖民地和半殖民地的弱小民族和被壓迫民衆，在這樣顯明的對照下，日益「反動」。所以·一方面·帝國主義國家的階級鬥爭是更其尖銳化；另一方面·各帝國主義爲重新分割世界市塲而起的第二次世界大戰，也愈益迫近，這一戰爭的結果，必然是減弱世界資本主義的力量，甚而至於完全消滅在這樣的一個塲合之下，英帝國主義在去年的洛桑會議中，曾提議在今年召開一經濟會議，企圖在這一會議中，來挽救資本主義日益崩潰的命運，即找尋資本主義危機的出路。</p>
<p>會議是在本月十二日開幕的，所提出討論的有六大議綱···㈠通貨與信用政策··㈡物價··㈢資本移動問題··㈣國際貿易的限制··㈤關稅及協定政策··㈥生產及貿易的組織。從英皇的開幕詞和該會主席麥唐納的開會辭中·可以知道帝國主義國家對于這一會議是希望有相當成功的。</p>
<p>可是，事實上却不幸得很，當一開始討論到這些議題的實際辦法的時候各帝國主義國家相互間的衝突立刻就發生了。首先是英美法等國對于穩定通貨·减低關稅·安定匯價等問題的衝突。因爲關稅障壁的消餘，通貨的穩定，匯兌限制的取消等，都是各帝國主義者經濟的器，都是企圖用以抵制别國經濟的進攻而滅絕自已國家内的恐慌的！</p>
<p>前面已經說過，這次會議是爲了要「恢復」繁榮··要「恢復」繁榮，當然非消滅資本主義的敵人丨社會主義的國家蘇聯不可。所以這次會議的目的·就在於會商怎樣使各帝國主義相互間的矛盾得暫時緩和而來一致的進攻蘇聯。對于這一層，德國法西斯蒂金融資本家的代表胡根堡，在會議中公開提出反蘇聯的說帖，是最明顯不過的證據。</p>
<p>總之，這一會議的結果，各帝國家對于若干經濟問題，或許會有原則上一般的，空洞的同意··但牠們相互間的主要衝突，却仍是無法解决的。換一句話說，資本主義的根本缺點是無法醫治的··縱使有部份的成效，也祇是一時的。所以，在這次會議之後，各帝國主義相互間的衝突定將愈益加深，而反蘇聯的戰爭也將愈益迫切了。</p>
<p>「不要！只有二塊錢。」他冷冷地說。</p>
<p>我恨恨地夾着衣包，仍舊走了出來。在人行道上走往第二家去。可是我剛要跨進第二家的門口時，裹面的朝奉已經在搖着手說··「不要，不要。」第三家也是这樣，第四家也是這樣，第五第六家還是這樣。我走在路上，心裹發急了，怎麽素來窮朋友們認爲的外婆家，現在也拒絕外甥進門了？這樣一家一家的一直走到第九家，總算萬幸，他們没有拒絕我進去。</p>
<p>「當多少？」</p>
<p>「你說多少？」</p>
<p>「三塊錢。」</p>
<p>「十塊錢好嗎？」</p>
<p>「那裹當得到十塊錢！」</p>
<p>贖的啊丨」</p>
<p>「没有用啊丨在這個年頭什麽都當不起，别人家是不要，我們總算是還在收收。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「因爲没下去的衣服多昨很，賣不掉。這個年頭家家銀根緊，要是收下來的東西，没有人來贖，没下了又没有人要買，即就要擱殺哩。」朝奉先生說了一大篇生意話。</p>
<p>我没有法兒，就三塊錢把衣服當下了。手裹拿着一張當票和三塊大洋鈿，心想怎麽辦法呢？每月五元的房租已欠了兩個月·包飯作裹的飯費欠了一個半月·本來想當掉這套西裝來先付一半的，但現在祗當得三塊錢，夠付什麽呢？心裹轉着念頭，低下的兩條尊腿就遲疑地在人行道上徘徊了，不敢就回去看那冷的臉和惡的獰笑。</p>

<h3>一九二六年的W村</h3>
<p>— 明發</p>
<p>彷彿是耘過「上岸田」的時節·W村的空氣驟然的緊張起來。黃泥壁上現出許多標語··「打倒土豪劣紳，」「廢除高利貸」之類。孩子們歡天喜地的唱着走上前去，光明在前，同志們丨丨奮鬥」的進行曲。三官殿裹唸「阿彌陀佛」的老太婆也無心唸經，却凑在祠堂旁邊聽熱閙。村上這些赤肩大漢一個個磨拳擦掌的感到無上的興奮。變過了，一切都變過了，「我們得見天日了丨」大漢們都昻着頭頸說。</p>
<p>這一天，王氏宗祠正門大開，許多赤肩大漢一桌桌地圍繞着喝茶。座位上面雖然也有穿長衫馬褂的擠着在内·但人數是不多。串壺（煑開水的大銅壺　肚内可燒炭的）嘴上的水蒸汽·依着微</p>
<h3>特種自我職業介紹老實人的老實話</h3>
<p>— 鄭成之</p>
<p>時候已是下午五點多鐘了。我躺在床上，想來想去。空虚的肚皮總使我没辦法·於是·只得把一件夏天的西裝褂子包好就走出門去。到了第一間當舖，說是夏天的，不要。本來悵惘的心已打算不再去问津了，但爲了要充實肚皮的綠故，我又走到第二間去試試看。出乎意料之外的是，這一回却當我一塊錢了··於是我便拿着這一塊錢走進法政學院的飯廳裹買飯票去。</p>
<p>今晚法政學院演劇，劇塲也就是我瘦的飯廳。演劇的時間快到了，有許多觀衆已經集合在那兒，劇塲内嘈雜得不堪。有一位出風頭的學生，身邊帶着一位很漂亮的女郎·我知道他們是演劇者或是什麽職員的。那個學生鑽來鑽云一會兒跑到這兒·一會兒又跑到那兒·問問這個·又問問那個·看他的情形是很忙的樣子。起先我看見他穿着白嗶嘰的西裝褲子和黑色的西裝褂子，但一會兒我又見他是穿着上下一色的全套白嗶嘰西裝了。</p>
<p>在我面前是一個那麽出風　的學生，和我當衣裳才有飯吃的對照之下我的心情是用不着描寫出來的，但正因爲有了這一個對照，我便打定主意來寫這一篇東西想偕文字的力量去找一個職業了。我　　　　無所能　　倘使有付=什麽地方用得着我的話我自信尚有相當的把握。　　　作過幾　　　寫過許多小品文以及短篇論評這些東西都散見　各報及各雜志上，所以　如有繼　校對一類的工作，更所歡迎！通信處本刋　風的激盪，不時向着廳堂濔漫，似乎告訴人說，量的變化到了相當時期必然要轉到質的變化的。談話開始了。嘈雜聲裹隱約可聽到的是··</p>
<p>「今天我們所要討論的問題是農會如何改組同時應該好好的舉出幾個委員，要提得起筆，要講得了事······現在先推出大會的主席來。」</p>
<p>「我看最好是守翁罷寫又寫得來，說又說得來，無論在資格上，在地位上，都値得我們推崇的。」坐在東角穿寗綢馬褂的秃頭拂着紈扇翹起嘴發言了。</p>
<p>「楚翁的話說得眞對，我們一致贊同。」旁邊兩個異口同聲的附和着「對是對的，不遇····唔丨」</p>
<p>「不行丨不行！」阿成哥到了這個時候實在有點忍耐不住了。他從他那豪爽的氣槪上，粗壯的喉音裹繼續發出斬釘截鐵似的呼聲來：「農會須要由我們務農的人自已來辦理的，不然不呌農會。我們不要穿長衫馬褂的管閑事！」</p>
<p>他的話出口後，祠堂裹吚吚啞啞的嘈雜聲越發響得起勁；桌子的拍桌子，「駡娘」的駡娘，熙煕攘攘亂做一堆。過了一歇，守翁站起來對阿成哥發言了：「你這話說得不對丨你有什麽本領敢在這裹誇口丨你識得字嗎？你識得，做一篇給大家看看。」</p>
<p>「滾你媽的！你識字有什麽希罕！没有我們種田人，看你們文章敎爾曹」敎隻鳥！要先活活地去餓死！你會「做一篇」，我會「挑一担」，我們來交換一下罷！你會得落田嗎？」</p>
<p>「好，好，好極！好極！我們剝了他的衣裳，呌他到田裹去嘗一嘗味道。」八九十個大漢一齊發出笑聲，挺着肩膀拍手。</p>
<p>村莊上的暮烟漸漸射進王氏宗祠裹面來了。大家都感到要進晚餐，於是簡單的作了一個會議的結束：</p>
<p>「擁護阿成哥！打倒土豪劣紳！」</p>

<p>— 王良才</p>
<p>丨借書不需保證金丨在現社會内，一切都成爲商品化，敎育自然也不在例外，所以只有富家的子弟得享受充分敎育的機會，而貧窮者則多被　棄於敎育的門外。然而在這個年頭，時代的浪潮，深深的剌激我們，使我們不安於日常的生活，而在在都需要我們提高業於外界事物的認旘與把握，以爲我們實踐的準備，因爲没有實踐的理論固然是死的，而没有理論的實踐也易趨于盲動。所以人們的求知慾，並不見因此减低，反而日益增高，尤以我們店員學徒，無論是爲爭求自身的利益或獲得全人類的福利，更需要求得多量的知識。</p>
<p>我們店員學徒，固然因爲所處環境的惡劣，一切都被朿縛，没有半點自由，每日整整的要做十幾小時的工作，而所得工資，尚不夠個人最低限度的生活費用，自然更談不至進什麽學校，甚至連商業夜校，也没有去讀的可能，因爲這種學校，也是爲營利而設，每月的學費，至少也要三五元，我們當然没有這種的力量，但是根據上面的所述，我們却又不得不求知，於是我們只有於自修的一途了。可是自修也不是易事，應有怎樣自修的門徑，固不必說，單就書籍一項而論，也就成爲問題，因爲現時除報章外，書籍的取得，要花很高的代價。我們只要看近年來，書店老板因爲要取得多量的利潤，不惜將書價提高，所以　海得籍的價格，　　　在一一二四以上，頂起嗎的也要好幾角錢一本，我們那裹有這　多錢來購買書籍呢丨不錢</p>

<p>我因爲已開始作該館經常的主顧獲得實惠不少，所以不敢緘默自私，樂於向我們全上海的店員學徒介紹，使我們店員學徒都能享受該館所給予我們的利益。我敎望我們店員學徒踴躍的向該館借讀，同時更希望大家將該館作爲我們自已的圖書館，傾全力加以維護，使它能得到更完美的發展，以成爲我們良好求知的工具。</p>

<p>Baisha Island, Parrot Island and Other Disaster Areas Expand, Municipal Government Staff Prepare for Full Mobilization for Rescue</p>
<h3>Waterlogged Areas Experience Gradual Traffic Disruption</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The river rose six inches on the 24th, with the water mark at 46 feet 8 inches, exceeding the normal shoreline by three inches. The One, Two, Three Special Districts of Hankou were flooded, with water entering the sidewalks. Qiaokou, Luojiadun, Xinjiadi, and Xiaojiadi were all submerged. Outside Zhanggong Dyke and Gushushu Dyke, civilian houses were completely flooded, and Changfeng Dyke was particularly dangerous. In Wuchang's Jinbaisha Island, Hanyang's Jiajiazhui, Parrot Island, and other disaster areas, the affected areas expanded. On the 24th, the Municipal Government instructed all municipal staff to remain on duty on the 25th to work intensely on flood prevention. The materials procurement department of the Public Works Bureau provided round-the-clock service. It is also reported that a flood prevention conference will be held with Japanese and French authorities to implement the principle of Sino-foreign cooperation. If the water rises another 1.2 feet, reaching 48 feet, all government agencies will be fully mobilized for rescue. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The river rose another two inches in the evening, with the water mark reaching 47 feet. Traffic was gradually disrupted in all the flooded areas. Five locations in Wuqing Sluice experienced rising water, and leaks were heard at Shanjiashan Sluice. The situation at Zhanggong Dyke's Jintan and Yintan sections was critical. According to Xi Dejiong, Director of the Engineering Department of the Economic Council, this year's water level has broken a century-old record. He is determined to stay in Hankou to supervise flood prevention and work with people from all walks of life to avert the catastrophe. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Huangmei and Jiayu Report Critical Situation</h3>
<p>)Hankou( In Hubei, many sections of the Jianghan main dike and civilian dikes are not strong or unfinished, so flooding is unavoidable. In Huangmei County, the Qichongkou Dike is crucial for the safety of seven counties in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces. Its Duan Yao Kou and Liu Zuo Kou dike bodies have sunk into the water and are extremely dangerous. County Magistrate Huang Danchu urgently telegraphed the provincial government, which forwarded the telegram to the headquarters to report the danger. Also, Jiayu County Magistrate Lu Bangxie telegraphed the province, saying that the Jinshui Dam was leaking, and river water was pouring into the county, and the dikes were in critical condition. He is supervising thousands of civilians to rush to the rescue and requested assistance from the provincial government. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Threatens South China</p>
<p>Using Anti-Japanese Movement as Pretext</p>
<h3>Dispatching Warships to Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>)Tokyo( According to information received by the naval authorities from South China, the anti-Japanese movement centered in Guangdong has recently become active again. The 19th Route Army and Chen Jitang have purchased machine guns, airplanes and other military equipment from the United States. The situation is quite unstable. Therefore, for contingency considerations, the naval authorities have dispatched the warship Isuzu to Fujian and the Saga to remain stationed in Guangdong for security. At Magong, three destroyers are ordered to stand by for deployment. (Telegraph from Dentsu News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Chahar Situation Not Optimistic</h3>

<h3>He and Huang Telegraph the Central Government and Chiang for Instructions</h3>
<p>)Beiping( Last night, Huang Fu and He Yingqin invited Song Zheyuan and other military and political figures to discuss the Chahar situation in detail. Feng expressed a strong welcome to Song's return to Chahar, but stated that he was unwilling to exchange the anti-Japanese banner for high office. Discussions about taking the position of Land Reclamation Director and telegraphing the cancellation of the Allied Army Commander-in-Chief were impossible, and leaving Zhangjiakou was even more out of the question. This was contrary to Song's original intention of mediation, and Song's situation will be even more difficult when he returns to Chahar at this time. Therefore, the date of return to Chahar must be postponed. According to sources close to Song, Song expressed indifference to returning to Chahar. The Chahar situation is not optimistic. Huang and He have telegraphed the central government and Chiang separately for instructions. At a time when the pseudo-organizations in eastern Hebei are brewing urgently, Feng's actions will increase the difficulty of the situation in North China. The authorities are extremely anxious about this. Outside reports that Fang and others are being settled to resolve the crux of the Chahar matter. According to insiders, Feng's ambitions are quite strong. The so-called Fang and Sun problems are only superficial. Hu Hanmin recently sent a representative to Tianjin, who has been in frequent contact with Feng. Song stated last night that he would obey any order from the central government and return to Chahar regardless of any sacrifice. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang has appointed Fang Zhenwu as Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Forward Army in Zhangjiakou and Ji Hongchang as Commander of the Northern Route Forward Army.

Ji Hongchang telegraphed Ping this morning to report that he had taken office as Commander of the Northern Route Forward Army in Zhangbei County. Bao Gang went to Datong from Zhangjiakou yesterday, reportedly due to disagreements with Fang. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Song Plans to First Order Pang's Army to Enter Chahar</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan postponed his trip to Guanyintang to inspect the troops due to continuous rain and muddy roads. Song stated that he should clarify the public and private aspects of the Chahar matter. At this critical moment, he should do his best to mediate. If there is no result, he will first order Pang's army to enter Chahar, which is also a last resort. Hu Hanmin telegraphed Feng with his opinions on the overall situation. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Bao Gang Disagrees with Fang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Gang left for Datong on the 22nd due to disagreements with Fang. Before leaving, he instructed his troops to return to Shanxi Province immediately. Zhang Renjie's troops are still stationed in Zhangjiakou. Fang has newly recruited more than 2,000 soldiers and is actively training them.

The military headquarters also intends to move to that location. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Certain Central Government Official Discusses Chahar</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain central government official discussed the Chahar issue. In order to avoid infighting and unite against foreign aggression, the central government accepted all seven points raised by Feng. Feng recently raised another four points, creating new problems, but the central government has always been willing to compromise and is willing to consider them, hoping to avoid another civil war. Regarding the issue of Sun Dianying's troops moving to Qinghai, the people of Qinghai have repeatedly expressed that they should not deploy more guest troops to Qinghai to avoid increasing the burden on the people of Qinghai. This is indeed the case. Qinghai Province has seen a decline in production and a halt to exports in recent years. If the troops go, there will be no food. Whether Sun's troops will move to Qinghai for reclamation is currently undecided by the central government and will only be discussed after the Chahar issue is resolved. Regarding the volunteer troops of Deng Wen and Li Fuqing, originally the old troops of Ma Zhanshan, the central government will designate a certain place for Ma to reorganize and train them.

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops withdrawing from Tongxian County and Sanhe, Jixian, and Baodi counties are mostly attached units. More than 5,000 troops were sent to Tangshan to be transported out of the pass, and the Japanese main force being transferred to the northern Manchuria area has not withdrawn, and troops are being recruited in Pingju and other counties, which have been formed into an army commissioning Chen as the army commander, stationed in Pingyu Avenue. Refugees fleeing back are going to Tongxian to take refuge because the Japanese troops have not withdrawn. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>)Beiping( The Japanese army recently compiled new troops in the name of Manchuguo and expanded the old army. As soon as the new army is formed, it will be sent to Ji Province to occupy and disturb the area. The truce and coordinated area is protected by the Japanese army as a balancing force. The puppet organization finds it difficult to suppress and pacify the bandits in the northeast, so it uses this method to entice and disarm them again. The Tonghua police used this method to disarm them and force them to build roads. The new army is being compiled. Liu Peichen's army has a total of three brigades, and two-thirds have been recruited. Recruitment is limited to 10 days. Important places for recruitment are near the mountainous towns on the eastern side of Liaoning. The recruits are bandits who bring their own guns and horses and stationed in the Tangshan area. Wang Tiexiang's army along the Ningdong line has a total of three brigades and one-third have been recruited. The recruitment will be completed within ten days and will be stationed in the Fengcheng Yixian area. Recruits must bring their own guns and horses. The stationing area is in Fengrun, Yongping and Sanhe area. For other expansion of the old army, such as Li Jichun's troops, there is no set amount for the expansion, and recruitment began on June 17 in the mountains of eastern Liaoning and in the Fengcheng Yixian area. Recruits must be bandits with guns and horses stationed in the Hebei area.</p>

<p>Economic Council Opens New Avenues</p>
<p>Focus of Meeting Shifts from Gold to Bread, Stabilizing Wheat Prices Will Precede Monetary Agreement</p>
<h3>Hu Genpei's Memorandum, Russia Lodges Protest with Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Tonight, the American representatives were able to shift the focus of attention of the delegates from gold to bread. As things stand, it seems that stabilizing wheat prices may precede monetary agreement. It appears that the United States urgently needs other countries to support its plan to raise prices before attempting to stabilize currency, and after two weeks of efforts by the delegates, the attempt to establish a de facto currency stabilization agreement seems unlikely to succeed due to the strong opposition of the United States, so it has to open new avenues. It has reunited the scattered spirits and engaged in the wheat problem. Many representatives have now agreed with the American proposal, believing that raising wheat prices will contribute to world recovery in the same way as currency stabilization. Therefore, a wheat agreement may become the first concrete achievement of the economic conference. At present, all parties are hoping that the United States, Argentina, Australia, and Canada will take the lead in drafting a wheat agreement containing a concrete plan to reduce wheat planting area. At the meeting of the Economic Subcommittee today, several people spoke, all saying that wheat prices are the key to world prices, and the shift in the power of the securities market is even greater than that of foreign exchange, and it is heard that the subcommittee will immediately prepare a temporary agreement, ready to be submitted for discussion on Monday. At this time, the Currency Subcommittee is also said to be nearing completion of its work, preparing several drafts for discussion on Monday's basis. The smaller countries that still believe that stabilizing finance is the primary purpose of the meeting are now hoping that the currency agreement can become the final culmination of the meeting. According to the current situation, this agreement will inevitably be one of the last to be established. (Telegraph from Guomin News Agency on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Congressmen Advocate Extending the Meeting</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government's attitude towards the London Economic Conference can be summed up in one sentence: If various agreements can only take effect after exchange rate stability, then France is prepared to continue cooperation in the economic sphere. (Telegraph from Reuters on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Many members of Congress believe that the attitude taken by the United States at the World Economic Conference has made the work of the meeting futile, so they have proposed to the House of Representatives that the government request an extension of the Economic Conference.

<h3>Dollar Falls, Prices Rise, American Industry Gradually Recovers and Prospers</h3>
<p>According to official news, there is no desire to take any action at present to prevent the rise of prices in the United States. Today, the Federal Reserve issued a report stating that from February to the end of May this year, the prices of six basic commodities in the United States have risen by 60%, while the dollar has only fallen by 15%. The rise in prices is partly due to the increase in world prices and partly due to the fall in the dollar and domestic forces. (Telegraph from Reuters on the 24th)</p>
<p>(New York) The recovery of industry and commerce in various parts of the United States continues to prosper, which is quite optimistic. According to statistics, the demand in various places has continued to increase, and the wages of workers have also increased compared with before. In addition, the orders of the Lutheron Steel Company this month have increased significantly compared with May. (Telegraph from Havas on the 24th)</p>
<h3>US Adopts National Economic Policy, Affecting the Retention of Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>)Washington( Due to the recent results of congressional votes, the United States has changed its direction and is increasingly focusing on national economic policies. American banker Baruch is currently drafting a memorandum to the American delegation in London, saying that the economic chaos in various countries is different and should be remedied internally by each country. This principle is contrary to what Roosevelt previously expressed, but people at the economic conference are not surprised. American newspapers expect the economic conference to fail and attribute the responsibility to European countries and blame them for their selfish hearts on the war debt issue. The adoption of a national economic policy by the United States will probably have an impact on the retention of American government personnel. There are frequent rumors that Secretary of State Hull will resign as soon as the economic conference closes, and banker Baruch will also succeed Woodin as Secretary of the Treasury.

<h3>Full Steam Ahead, British Prime Minister Takes a Tonic</h3>
<p>(London) The crisis of the World Economic Conference is now an undeniable fact, so the chairman of the conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald, tried his best to dispel pessimistic and bleak feelings about the future when he met with reporters today. MacDonald said, "We must go full steam ahead." Although, in experience, all world conferences must go through various difficult periods, and this dangerous period must be in the second week after the convening of the conference because at this time, the conflicts of words and the differences of opinions of all parties begin to be gradually revealed. However, according to MacDonald's opinion, this dangerous period can be controlled in the third week because at that time, one can gradually abandon private opinions and misunderstandings and consider the real topic. MacDonald also said that the current situation of the meeting is slightly tense due to the announcement of the United States regarding the stability of currency, but it cannot be said that it has reached a dangerous period. As for the rumors that the meeting will be extended to the autumn, it is even more nonsense because extending the meeting to the autumn will not only not improve the chances of success but will also complicate the situation due to the blows suffered by the currency. MacDonald finally said that the result of the meeting may be defeated by the issue of currency stability, but the representatives of all countries can still strive forward and will eventually achieve victory.

<h3>Japan's Privy Council Committee Passes the Tariff Truce Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The first review committee of the Privy Council for participation in the tariff truce case held a meeting at the Privy Council office at 9:30 a.m. today. First, Foreign Minister Uchida explained the reasons for the request for consultation and the conditions for the empire to retain. Afterwards, Advisor Officers such as Mizumachi, Kawai, and Kubota asked the following questions: ㈠ What are the benefits of participating in the truce resolution? ㈠ Are there too many conditions to retain, and does this eliminate the reason for participating? ㈠ As for retaliatory measures, can trade means be fully effective? ㈠ What is the content of the conditions retained by India and other countries that joined later? Afterwards, Foreign Minister Uchida and government officials replied as follows: ㈠ As for retaliatory measures, retaliatory defense measures seem to be sufficient to deal with them within the scope of the domestic legal system. ㈠ If a country that recognizes the truce case has an attitude that is unfavorable to Japan, it can protest. Afterwards, there were two or three amendments, and the government's original plan was passed at 12:10 p.m., and the meeting was adjourned, and the Privy Council's main meeting will be convened on the morning of the 28th to deliberate on the case.

<h3>British Liberal Party Leader Discusses International Trade Freedom</h3>
<p>(London) Liberal Party leader Samuel gave a speech in Manchester this afternoon, mentioning the World Economic Conference, saying that the conference is different from the disarmament conference.

<h3>Economic and Monetary Subcommittee Holds Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing in Detail the Cases Submitted (London) The six subcommittees of the Economic and Monetary Committees of the World Economic Conference held separate non-public meetings today to discuss in detail the matters submitted for discussion. (Telegraph from London on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The discussion of economic issues at the World Economic Conference has surpassed monetary issues, as generally expected. Starting today, the subcommittees of the Monetary Committee are limited to reviewing various principles, and their implementation depends entirely on future agreements. This work is purely technical in nature. On the contrary, the situation of economic issues is different. Various major products have already obtained the consent of various countries. Therefore, starting next week, the subcommittee on "Restructuring Production and Marketing" will be able to conduct precise discussions on these products. It is expected that wheat will be discussed first, followed by the proposals of Cuba and the Dutch East Indies on sugar production restrictions, and then other necessities of life, such as cotton and wood.

<h3>Memorandum Demanding Colonies, Russia Lodges Protest with Germany</h3>
<p>Believes it Violates the Treaty of Berlin (London) The Russian representative claimed today that Russia had indeed sent a serious protest to Germany, opposing the remarks about Russia in the Hu Genpei memorandum. The 66th memorandum of Hu Genpei to the World Economic Conference stated that the land of Russia and Eastern Europe should be German colonies. (Telegraph from London on the 24th)</p>
<p>)Moscow( Dr. Hugenberg recently submitted to the London World Economic Conference a memorandum urging the recovery of Germany's former colonies in Africa and incidentally proposing that part of Soviet territory should be opened as German colonies. This has aroused a sharp protest from the Soviet government. The Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Xing Quke, has sent a note involving this matter to the German Acting Foreign Minister Biro. The note pointed out that the German delegation's memorandum to the Chairman of the World Economic Conference contained points involving the Soviet Union, which was none other than a direct request from the German delegation to the representatives of other powers to cooperate in eliminating the "revolutionary and internal chaos that has emerged in Russia." In other words, it is a declaration of war on the Soviet Union. The note continued, following this paragraph of the German memorandum, is the demand that Germany must take Soviet territory as a colony. The Soviet note declared that this hostile declaration is entirely contrary to the obligations assumed by the German government in the Treaty of Berlin of April 24, 1926. The note also firmly protested against this act of undermining the treaty relations between the two countries.</p>

<h3>American Warship Preparing Provisions in June to Carry Roosevelt to England</h3>
<p>To Berth in the Thames for an Onboard Conference, but Roosevelt's Secretary Denies the President's Intention to Travel Abroad (Washington) The American fast cruiser Indianapolis resumed preparations for departure today. As a result, rumors have resurfaced that the American President intends to visit England immediately should the World Economic Conference truly reach an impasse. It is said that if Moley, who is currently en route to England, cannot provide a basis for agreement in London, the President will be asked to go in person. At that time, the American President will go to Eastport, Maine, board the warship, and sail to England. When this was brought up to the White House and the Navy Department, they neither confirmed nor denied it. As for the warship's preparations for departure, the Navy Department stated that it was for several trial voyages, but the detailed plans for the trial voyages were not disclosed.

<p>Portland, USA The American President's secretary today denied the rumor that President Roosevelt intends to rush to London aboard the cruiser Indianapolis. Roosevelt is currently cruising on the yacht Amberjack off Chibig Island and has no plans to travel to London. According to a New York Daily News dispatch from Provincetown, Massachusetts, the U.S. Navy is preparing to send the President to London when the President's trusted advisor, Professor Moley, sends an urgent telegram requesting his presence. If Professor Moley feels that the difficulties encountered by the World Economic Conference cannot be alleviated without the American President's personal intervention, he will send a telegram requesting the President to go to England. If so, the cruiser Indianapolis will carry the President at full speed to London. The cruiser is currently procuring food in Philadelphia, enough to last for half a year. It is expected that the American President will not set foot on foreign soil but will remain on the cruiser anchored in the Thames,</p>

<p>After the Communist Government Falls, England and Germany Will Divide the Russian Market</p>
<p>(Rumor: German Representative Made This Suggestion to England)</p>
<h3>Little Entente Negotiating with Russia for Resumption of Relations; Significant Progress in U.S.-Russian Negotiations</h3>
<p>National Telegram, London, 24th Foreign Minister Titulescu of Romania visited Soviet Russian Ambassador Litvinov at the Soviet Russian Embassy today to discuss the resumption of normal relations between the Little Entente countries and Moscow. It is reported that the Romanian Foreign Minister's visit to the Soviet Embassy is the first since the European War. The talks today also covered the issue of concluding non-aggression treaties after the Little Entente countries and Soviet Russia resume relations in the future. The status of Bessarabia was also discussed at length. Afterwards, it was also heard that Czech Foreign Minister Beneš had already contacted Litvinov once on behalf of the Little Entente countries.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there has been significant progress in the understanding between the United States and Russia since Litvinov, U.S. representative Bullitt, and Morgenthau met and since Soviet Russian representative Mellaoke and U.S. Senator Couzens dined together. Although there has been no concrete action regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Russian representative stated that he is willing to order a large number of goods from the United States, provided that favorable credit terms can be negotiated. The U.S. representative also paid close attention to the potential of Soviet Russia to stimulate sales within the market during today's talks.</p>
<p>Today, according to unverified sources, a German representative proposed to England that if the Soviet Russian Communist government were overthrown, Germany and England should divide the Russian market equally. It is said that the Hitler government anticipates that the Soviet Russian Communist government will soon collapse. This news has not yet been confirmed by official sources, but Soviet Russian journalists have telegraphed Moscow this afternoon.</p>
<p>(Washington) According to sources familiar with the issue of U.S.-Russian relations, the United States will legally recognize Soviet Russia in July. Once recognized, the two countries will sign a trade agreement and provide loans to Russia, allowing Soviet Russia to purchase goods from the U.S. business community. The method will follow the model of the recent $50 million cotton and wheat loan agreement between China and the U.S. Negotiations between the U.S. and Russia on this matter are currently underway in London, with the U.S. represented by Bullitt, a State Department assistant at the Economic Conference, and Russia by Foreign Minister Litvinov. In addition, Morgenthau, the U.S. representative attending the four-wheat-producing-countries conference, is also discussing the restoration of diplomatic relations and economic compromises between the two countries with Litvinov. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Simon to Meet with Russian Foreign Minister Tomorrow; Hope for Restoration of British-Russian Trade Relations</h3>
<p>(London) Today, observers expect that the conflict in British-Russian trade will end no later than the 26th of next month. According to reliable sources, British Foreign Secretary Simon and Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov have agreed to discuss the matter on Monday. The fact that British Prime Minister MacDonald invited Litvinov to lunch today indicates that both Britain and Russia are willing to negotiate on this matter. It is generally speculated that the British ban on Russian goods may be lifted early if Russia agrees to release the two engineers and send them back to England. Even if that is not the case, the current ban, which expires on July 26, will likely not be extended. It is heard that the discussions on Monday will be completely informal. It is reported that since the British ban on goods, Russia has suffered significant losses in trade, and even U.S.-Russian talks on restoring relations have been delayed. If Britain can negotiate a ceasefire in the trade war, it could also open the way for Litvinov and U.S. Secretary of State Hull to hold informal talks on restoring relations.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Rise of American Nationalism and the Reality of the World Economy</h3>
<p>The main task of the World Economic Conference is to set aside the issue of war debts and temporarily avoid negotiations. Therefore, in accordance with the agenda set at the Lausanne Conference and the general needs of the world recently, the stabilization of currency parities should be the most important economic issue at present. Unfortunately, in reality, European countries are unwilling to easily let go of war debts and especially hope that the United States can make timely concessions to resolve this. However, the United States is quite indifferent to this, expressing its willingness to negotiate on the spot at the Economic Conference. As a result, the rift between Europe and the United States has resurfaced. Although England has already paid a small portion of the war debts due to save face for the British Empire, France still insists on its previous proposal and has no intention of repaying the debt. This situation is brewing a huge obstacle for the current World Economic Conference and is also the only crisis for international cooperation.</p>
<p>As for currency stabilization, it should be supported by all countries in principle and in practice. If a common conclusion can be reached at the conference and put into practice, it would also benefit the non-capitalist countries. Economic panic may be given a chance to breathe. However, the total amount of cash in the world is only about 12 billion U.S. dollars, of which the United States and France account for two-thirds, totaling about 8 billion U.S. dollars or more. This cash is currently stored in vaults. Although it is ostensibly a standard for measuring all prices, it is in fact equivalent to legal tender. It lacks a circulation function and is unable to adjust imbalances. Now that the United States has abandoned the gold standard and adopted a policy of currency inflation, France, in order to maintain its leading position in Europe, advocates immediately reducing currency parities and implementing stable international exchange rates. Therefore, the confrontation between the United States and France is sharp and difficult to reconcile, and the cancer of international economic relations is expanding. Recently, when the U.S. representative discussed the issue of currency stabilization with the United States, England, and France, he stated that the U.S. government believes that the method of absolute currency stabilization must be jointly discussed. If a temporary currency stabilization agreement is established, the future of the Economic Conference will inevitably be affected. The U.S. government believes that this move is not suitable for today's situation and is quite detrimental to the U.S.'s efforts to raise prices. As a result, the World Economic Conference has been greatly shaken. In particular, it contradicts France's proposal to immediately stabilize currencies. Those who were previously optimistic about international relations have now fallen into pessimism.</p>
<p>So why is the United States not actively seeking international cooperation to overcome the current difficulties? The fact is that the United States itself has many difficulties, such as having more than 12 million unemployed workers, production becoming increasingly excessive, and agricultural product prices falling, all of which are enough to trap the "golden" kingdom in extreme difficulties. The financial panic in March of this year still makes people feel terrified and apprehensive. If it complies with international conditions and accommodates the demands of England and France, then the United States itself will fix the value of its currency, making the policy of currency inflation lose its effect within the country. General prices will fall as a result. Therefore, the work that the United States has been doing for months to stabilize the domestic market will be like a bubble. Therefore, at this point, it has no choice but to</p>
<p>show that its fundamental national policy is to first stabilize its own economy and then extend it to the world. This truly has its own difficulties.</p>
<p>However, in our observation, the development of this kind of nationalism is only enough to increase the chaos in the world. First, the result of the United States' denial of currency stabilization and the establishment of international agreements will inevitably arouse the resentment of countries that maintain the gold standard. Then, the confrontation between Europe and the United States will become more serious. Second, the development of capitalism has reached its highest form today. Its organic structure is extremely complex. The biggest cause of financial panic is the inability to recover investments in the industrial sector on time. Both domestic and foreign countries are trapped in a state of frozen funds. At the same time, there is also a feeling of too much savings. England, which is good at using capital, can barely support itself without causing a major breakdown. The United States lacks sufficient control over foreign investment and consumer markets. Therefore, insisting on nationalism will only temporarily raise domestic prices. The third, currency is unstable, and tariff agreements are difficult to achieve, and retaliatory tariffs to restrict the import of foreign goods are even more inevitable. As a result, overseas markets will become narrower, and economic panic will deepen. Even if general domestic prices temporarily rise, the unemployment problem will still not be resolved. The general social consumption capacity is also difficult to increase. In practice, the three causes of the United States' implementation of raising its own</p>
<p>prices and disregarding currency stability, how can this be a good strategy?</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Representative Arrived in Tokyo Yesterday for Negotiations on the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Japan Ignores Our Country's Protest</p>
<p>)Tokyo( Soviet Russian representative Katzlovsky and Kotzenetov, chairman of the Chinese Eastern Railway, arrived in Tokyo at 7:15 this morning to attend the meeting in Tokyo on the 26th regarding the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (Dentsu Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese government submitted a document on the 22nd regarding the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Consul General Hidaka in Nanjing. Although the protest document has not yet reached the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is expected that there will be similar protests as the negotiations between Russia and Manchuria progress. The Japanese foreign affairs authorities believe that Japan is not a party to the negotiations, and no matter how much it protests, it cannot provide support, so they have decided to ignore it. (Dentsu Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Malaya Also Boycotts Japanese Goods; British-Japanese Relations Worsening</p>
<h3>Matsudaira Lodges Protest with Simon; Japan-India Negotiations to Begin in Mid-August</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received from a certain source, the Federal Government of Malaya, which imposed shockingly high tariffs on Japanese-made rubber shoes, milk, etc. at the Ottawa Conference last year, is now seeking to implement new means to exclude Japanese goods. Malaya's tariff policy towards Japan is gradually intensifying, and its future is not promising. (Nichiren Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an announcement by the authorities today, Japanese Ambassador to London Matsudaira visited British Foreign Secretary Simon on the 22nd, as instructed by Tokyo, stating that the Malayan government had increased tariffs on Japanese imports from 20% to 80%. He requested Simon to use his influence to have the Malayan government abolish the newly added tax. Matsudaira also asked Simon to pay attention to the shock felt by the entire Japanese nation due to the cancellation of the Japan-India trade agreement. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>)Tokyo( According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador to England Matsudaira visited Foreign Minister Simon on the afternoon of the 22nd and lodged a serious protest as follows: 1. The increase in tariffs in the Federation of Malaya is in violation of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, so the British government should order the Malayan government to withdraw it. 2. After the cancellation of the Japan-India Trade Treaty, the continuous increase in tariffs in British territories has dealt a great blow to the Japanese people. Therefore, it is hoped that the British government will reconsider, etc. Foreign Minister Simon did not reply immediately but promised to reply again. If Ambassador Matsudaira's request is not granted and the Federation of Malaya's increase in tariffs is not announced for cancellation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lodge another protest, which will inevitably become an issue at the Economic Conference. Therefore, how the British government officially responds will have a major impact on Anglo-Japanese friendship, which is quite noteworthy. (Dentsu Telegram) (Tokyo) According to a telegram from Consul General Miyake in Calcutta, the Indian government's opinion on the Simla Conference is that Japanese and Indian representatives should substantially decide on the conclusion of a trade treaty at the Simla Conference, and formal diplomatic documents must be held in London. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also believes that the Indian government has no diplomatic power, and it wants the British government to grant its representatives the power to negotiate. The British policy towards India may not be as simple as that, so it is not necessary to give the Japanese representatives the power to negotiate diplomatically. After the Simla Conference ends, Ambassador Matsudaira and the British government will hold diplomatic negotiations in London. (Dentsu Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese-Indian negotiation representative, Minister Sawada, and his party are scheduled to take the postal ship Tokiwa Maru from Kobe on July 19 to India and begin formal negotiations in mid-August. As a result of continuous consultations between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the private sector, the following fundamental policies have been decided: 1. The Japanese government will negotiate in a mutually beneficial manner in light of the current state of imports and exports between Japan and India. 2. In addition to negotiations between representatives of the two governments, representatives of the private sector of both countries will also conduct negotiations at the same time. 3. Private sector representatives will negotiate on the types and prices of major trade products. 4. After this agreement is reached, it will serve as a provisional agreement and the basis for a new Japan-India Trade Treaty. (Nichiren News Agency Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>)Tokyo( According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Consultant Noya and Commercial Officer Matsuyama stationed in London met with Wilson, the top consultant of the British Ministry of Commerce, on the 22nd to discuss the Anglo-Japanese Consultation Association. As a result of sincere talks, they agreed on the prerequisites for government consultations, agreements on the prices of goods, trade regions, and items, and the mediation of negotiations between those engaged in the industry in both countries.

<p>)Tokyo( According to a report from Singapore received by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Federal Government of Malaya, in order to implement the Ottawa Agreement last year, has already increased tariffs on Japanese goods such as rubber shoes and milk. Recently, it intends to increase tariffs on all Japanese goods. The future of Japanese-Malayan trade is very bleak. The amount of trade between Japan and the Malay Peninsula in the past two years is as follows:</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Expenditure Will Exceed 950 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry's budget for the next year will be greatly increased compared to this year. There are two main reasons for this: 1. After withdrawing from the League of Nations, Japan's international position is gradually becoming isolated, and it must greatly expand its military to maintain its original international position. 2. In order to permanently occupy Manchuria and increase the number of troops stationed in Manchuria, the budget for this year is about 447 million yuan, which is still not enough. The increase in the budget for the next year is about 80 million yuan. Therefore, the Army's budget for the next year will exceed 527 million yuan. Although the Navy Ministry's budget can reduce the expenses for the Manchurian Incident, it needs to increase the expenses for the establishment of new air squadrons, the maintenance of warships, the arrangement of land and water, the construction of warships, and the maintenance of new warships. The increased expenses will be about 60 million yuan. Therefore, the total military expenditure for the next year will exceed 950 million yuan. (China United Press Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference Adjournment Extended</h3>
<p>Davis Returns to the U.S. to Make a Statement (London) Representatives attending the Economic Conference from the Disarmament Conference stated that the disarmament talks in Geneva will be postponed until October. The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference was originally scheduled to adjourn until next Tuesday. Now, because the Economic Conference does not seem to be able to conclude in a short time and the situation in the conference is uncertain, it is even more difficult to conduct disarmament talks at the same time. Therefore, Chairman Henderson intends to convene the General Commission on June 27 to decide to extend the adjournment period. Representatives now hope that the world economic situation will improve slightly by early October and that most of the current disputes between countries can be resolved. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>

Davis made a statement on the issue of disarmament, saying that countries are considering the international arms inspection system and that their attitude is more favorable than considering various security pact plans. He also said that although the work of the Disarmament Conference is progressing slowly, it is indeed making progress. He will return to Geneva before the Disarmament Conference is adjourned. Finally, Davis said that the United States will adopt a "Crusader" attitude on the issue of disarmament, meaning that it will support the Disarmament Conference. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>Our Country's Proposal Failed to Pass (Geneva) There were few attendees at the International Labor Conference today. The Chinese representative, Xiao Jirong, indirectly referred to the activities of the Japanese military in his speech, which moved the listeners. Xiao said that China today is the victim of a terrible war, with foreign aggression affecting hundreds of millions of people, and the rest of the more than 400 million people have lost part of their purchasing power as a direct result of this aggression. Xiao then proposed a motion arguing that the conference should ask the Governing Body to find ways for all Chinese and foreign industrial and commercial enterprises located in concessions and leased territories to operate in accordance with Chinese labor regulations. The motion failed to pass due to a lack of a quorum. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Newly Exposed Secret of Jewish Merchant New Khan Trafficking Opium</h3>
<p>Did he privately transport narcotics to the United States from Shanghai? He made a significant profit, especially from morphine. The U.S. Attorney in San Francisco announced the case of private trafficking of narcotics, and the main culprit, Qiu Da Yi Ci La, has already provided detailed information. It is said that the opium and extracted narcotics were disguised as tea and other canned and packaged goods and transported into the United States. Commercial firms were established in the East and on the Pacific coast of the United States to secretly manage the opium trade.</p>
<p>However, they also engaged in legal commerce simultaneously to avoid suspicion. A special storage location was set up in his house, capable of storing opium worth over 50,000 yuan. According to the prosecutor, this is the largest illegal narcotics trafficking organization seen in many years. Although there have been repeated crackdowns in the past, the trend of private trafficking has not been curbed. It is believed that the leader has now been captured. It is also reported that Yi Ci La confessed that he made a considerable profit from privately transporting narcotics from China to the United States, with morphine being the most frequently smuggled item. Yi Ci La will be tried on Friday (National Telegram, 23rd).</p>

<p>Strange Aircraft Appears in Berlin Sky, Efforts to Restore Air Force</p>
<p>Various parties believe the strange aircraft report to be fabricated. Goering announces construction of two police aircraft. Berlin, 24th (National Telegram) Prussian Premier Goering told reporters today that he will build two aircraft for the Berlin police to prevent the recurrence of yesterday's strange aircraft incident. According to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is indeed prohibited from having military aircraft, but these police aircraft are naturally not a matter of military defense. This measure is absolutely urgent. There is a danger tonight that bombs could be dropped on a defenseless government, and we can no longer delay self-defense measures. He also said that he is fully prepared to abolish bombing and other offensive aircraft, but we must have defensive aircraft. Deputy Secretary of Aviation Milch commented on the postponement of the disarmament conference to reporters, saying that yesterday's strange aircraft incident proves that Germany must insist on quickly achieving equality in armaments, and therefore cannot agree to postpone the meeting. However, he emphasized that Germany's equality in armaments is best achieved by other countries reducing their armaments.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Havas) The Kangdi News Agency published a message titled "Strange Aircraft Spotted Over Berlin, A Sign of the Red Plague," stating that a foreign aircraft squadron flew over Berlin, scattering leaflets insulting the government in the vicinity of various government offices. The aircraft type was unseen in Germany. It also stated that after scattering the leaflets, the aircraft quickly flew away, so it was impossible to determine which country it belonged to. German newspapers published this in an alarming manner, with criticism. The wording clearly seemed instructed, roughly stating that Germany, having completely disarmed, is vulnerable to foreign attacks and cannot defend itself. The aircraft flying over Berlin is clear evidence of this. Their tone seems to be using this as an excuse to demand the abolition of the Treaty of Versailles. For example, the Deutsche Tageszeitung stated, "Germany's disarmament is a danger to European peace. Yesterday's discovery of the aircraft is clear factual evidence." Other newspapers said that Marxism does not hesitate to use various methods to attack Germany. Vienna, 24th (Havas) Yesterday afternoon, an aircraft flew over the city of Linz on the Danube River, dropping leaflets that reprinted a declaration issued by the Austrian Social Democratic leader who had fled to the German town of Mönichskirchen, making a fierce attack on the Dollfuss government. This aircraft was mysterious, with no other markings on the fuselage except for a black spot.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Reuters) Official sources stated this afternoon that due to the foreign aircraft dropping leaflets over Berlin today, the government intends to request in Geneva that Germany be placed on an equal footing with other countries in terms of air and land armaments.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Reuters) The newspapers were ordered to publish an official announcement stating that Germany, being bound by the Treaty of Versailles, is unable to resist aerial intrusions, and therefore has no police aircraft to pursue the foreign aircraft that appeared over Berlin.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Reuters) According to official sources, the police and the aviation department reported that a foreign aircraft flew over Wilhelm Street, dropping leaflets insulting the German government. However, inquiries at the Tempelhof airfield revealed no knowledge of this matter. The newspapers all seemed to be publishing news about the aircraft on the front page under the orders of the authorities, but apparently, no one actually saw it.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (National Telegram) Today, The Times of London and most morning papers subtly suggest that the incident of the strange German aircraft scattering leaflets attacking the German government was staged by German officials in order to draw world attention to the country's lack of adequate air defense. Some newspapers even suggested that the whole thing was fabricated, citing their correspondents' failure to find a single leaflet as evidence. Even The Times stated that it was noteworthy that only German officials seemed to have seen the strange aircraft.</p>
<h3>German Boy Scouts Dissolved</h3>
<p>Democratic Party members disqualified. Berlin, 23rd (Reuters) Today, German Youth Leader Shirach, representing Chancellor Hitler, ordered the dissolution of the Boy Scouts and other similar organizations within Germany. All funds and properties are confiscated. Boy Scout members will be merged into the "National Youth League." The Boy Scouts run by Christian churches have also been disbanded, but the Catholic Boy Scouts have not been affected. London, the British Boy Scout authorities said they will not take any action because the German Boy Scouts have not yet joined the international union. However, the friendship between the British and German Boy Scouts is indeed very close. Berlin, 23rd (Reuters) Former Speaker of Parliament Dr. Löbe was arrested today. This move is related to the forced dissolution of the Social Democratic Party. In addition, several members of the Social Democratic Party were arrested.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (National Telegram) All one hundred and sixty Social Democratic members of parliament have been disqualified. Even if any bill in the future, such as amending the constitution, requires a two-thirds majority, it will still not need the assistance of the Catholic Centre Party members of parliament. After excluding the Social Democrats, there are still 446 seats, two-thirds of which is 298 seats. The National Socialist Party currently occupies 288 seats. Added to the two votes of cabinet member Seldte and Deputy Chancellor von Papen, it is only eight votes short of a two-thirds majority. It is not difficult to invite people to join the National Socialist Party to achieve this.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (National Telegram) Today, after the National Socialist Party took over the local Christian trade unions, all of Germany's trade unions are now under the control of the Hitler government.</p>
<h3>Poland Opposes Treaty Revision</h3>
<p>Warsaw, 23rd (National Telegram) Poland is determined to fight to the death to resist the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. This afternoon, a meeting of journalists was held at the assembly hall of Polish groups residing abroad. It was stated that all Poles around the world are now preparing to rise up at the signal and announce, in coordination with the motherland, that Poland will exhaust all its efforts to spiritually resist Germany's attacks and threats, and declare to the world that any revision of borders and demands on the Polish coast will be considered a declaration of war. The Polish people will now raise funds to help the government expand its navy and will demand that Poland have the opportunity for colonial activities.</p>
<p>[P Austria opposes Hitler</p>
<p>Members of the National Socialist Party disqualified. Vienna, 23rd (Reuters) After the cabinet resolved to prohibit the activities of the National Socialist Party in Austria, the Austrian Parliament today passed a bill to disqualify members of the National Socialist Party. At the same time, the National Socialist mayor of Zirl in Tyrol was sentenced to six weeks of imprisonment and a fine of ten Austrian schillings for attempting to release several arrested members of the National Socialist Party. Furthermore, because the mayor hung a black, white, and red flag when foreign journalists visited the city hall, he was sentenced to another four weeks of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Little Entente Opposes Austro-Hungarian Restoration</h3>
<p>Paris, 23rd (Reuters) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić stated here today that the Little Entente, namely Romania, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, will never allow the Austro-Hungarian restoration. Before Mr. Jevtić spoke, he discussed the issue with French Foreign Minister Pongu. It is reported that Mr. Pongu stated that France opposes the political union of Austria-Hungary. France only seeks economic goodwill among the countries of the Danube River, and has no other intentions. The idea of Austro-Hungarian restoration has been rampant recently, and there have been rumors that Mussolini has submitted this plan to the great powers, but this has been denied.</p>
<p>Vienna, 23rd (National Telegram) Recently, it has been rumored that Austria-Hungary is attempting to merge again, with a direct descendant of the Habsburgs as the monarch of both countries. However, someone from Hungary today expressed an opinion recounting past facts. Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös had previously stated repeatedly in parliament that he was extremely opposed to the merger of the two countries, and said that the Hungarian government has not yet reached the point of paying attention to the issue of the monarchy, and that the Hungarian state would not welcome the rule of a Habsburg figure. This statement by Gömbös is said to represent the public opinion of the Hungarian people. However, there is another matter related to this, namely that after the end of the European War, the countries that signed the Treaty of Trianon have actually recognized that Hungary is still a monarchy, but the throne is temporarily vacant.</p>
<p>Belgrade, 24th (National Telegram) The local authorities here recently discovered a large-scale espionage organization involving many former Austro-Hungarian army officers. Several people have been arrested and many documents have been seized.</p>

<h3>Central Government Hopes Anti-Japanese Propaganda Corps Will Work Hard to Suppress Communist Propaganda</h3>
<p>Nanjing (The Central Propaganda Committee replied to He Xia of the Anti-Japanese Bandit Suppression Propaganda Corps, stating that his commendable efforts in patriotic propaganda were noted. It was found that the North China Armistice Agreement was a local military cessation that did not involve politics and did not affect the government's fundamental policy toward Japan. In the future, the entire country should redouble its efforts to prepare for avenging shame and recovering lost territory. Therefore, anti-Japanese propaganda should continue. However, internal stability must come before external resistance, and bandit suppression must come before resisting aggression. The government, based on this principle, is actively suppressing bandits, hoping to eliminate the bandit threat in the shortest possible time, and then be able to exert all its efforts to resist aggression. If the corps can work hard to suppress communist propaganda in Guangdong and Fujian, the effect will be even greater. It is hoped that this will be taken into consideration.

<h3>Japanese Left-Leaning Movement Advances Rapidly</h3>
<p>Children of famous families also join the Communist Party, and a large number of secret documents are imported from New York. The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported on June 21 that since Iida Sukesaku, a member of the Kyoto Communist Party who was leaked during the inspection in February of Showa 7, infiltrated Kyoto and began to organize the Kyoto branch of the All-Association Council, he has spared no effort in carrying out secret work. On July 15 of the same year, the All-Association Branch Council was established, and the "Red Flag" organ was created to incite and win over many male and female party members. The most formidable of these is the municipal electricity sector, which is planning a general strike of municipal electricity in six major cities. On the one hand, it is contacting food, fiber, transportation, construction, metal and other factories, and establishing a fund network such as Kyoto University, Doshisha University, and Ryukoku University to expand and strengthen. It is planned to hold a large-scale demonstration on September 4, the International Proletarian Youth Memorial Day, and to carry out unstable plans during the November exercise.</p>
<p>After the Kyoto Prosecutor's Office detected various internal details, on September 3 of the same year, 188 police officers were mobilized to completely arrest 31 major figures such as Miyamoto Soji. On the 6th of the same month, Maeda Toshihiko, a member of the Kyoto branch of the Communist Party, was also arrested. After seven months of investigation, about 100 male and female students and workers were arrested. Among them, Kan Hideuo is the son of Osaka Mayor Kan Ichi, and Kawahashi Ichiro is the son of a certain member of parliament. It is rare for children of famous families to join the communist movement.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported on June 20 that recently, left-wing elements have been using the mask of Bible study to urgently publicize unstable documents.

Unexpectedly, at 10 a.m. on the 19th of this month, the society sent out tens of thousands of unstable documents such as "War and Peace," "Heaven and Purgatory," and "God and Demons," about dozens of kinds. These promotional documents are in four languages: Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean. They are all imported from the New York headquarters for customs inspection. They were sent from Naha to Kobe by Osaka Shosen via Ryukyu and Taiwan. They were about to be sent from Kobe to Tokyo when they were discovered by the Hyogo Prefectural Police Department, which immediately joined forces with the Aioi Bridge Police Station to send personnel to completely confiscate the documents.</p>

The capital was 17,264,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>The Sichuan War is Expanding</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang works hard to unify Sichuan, Yang Sen compromises with Liu Xiang, and Liu Wenhui is also fully preparing for war. Chongqing correspondence: In recent days, in the Sichuan war situation, Liu Xiang has become the protagonist. The scope of the war has expanded from west to south to north, and will even affect eastern Sichuan. The entire situation is completely trapped in war. All parties feel that the vitality has been exhausted due to years of war and hope for unification. Gu Xiang is determined to send troops to realize the unified Sichuan situation plan at the end of the previous Sichuan war. However, there is a lack of spiritual unity within the Liu army, and Liu Xiang looks down on the world and is arrogant. The future is difficult to be optimistic. Looking back on Liu Xiang before the Year of Wuchen, he was confined to a corner of Chongqing, relying on tax revenue to maintain military expenditures. At that time, about 20,000 soldiers still felt more than enough, so he actively expanded, which was resented by various armies. Therefore, the allied forces of Guo Rutong, Lai Xinhui, Yang Sen, Li Jiayu, and Luo Zezhou were formed.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Finally, Liu Xiang used flexible means to use divisive tactics to divide the allied forces. In one battle, he seized more than 20 counties of defense from Yang Sen. As a result, Liu's military prestige was greatly enhanced and his status was suddenly improved. He occupied Chongqing and Wan and controlled the source of munitions for various armies. His troops also increased to more than 100,000. In the Sichuan war last year, Liu's army seized more than 40 counties of defense from Wenhui, shocking the various armies in Sichuan. Liu Xiang vaguely claimed to be the King of Western Shu and had the intention of unifying the Sichuan situation. When the war in western Sichuan broke out last month, Liu Xiang believed that a great opportunity to unify the Sichuan situation had arrived. In addition to ordering all county magistrates in the garrison area to be responsible for supervising the local security of the team, he also transferred 80 regiments of troops scattered in various counties, totaling more than 80,000 people, and stationed them in Jianwei, Rongxian, Weiyuan Shou, Jingyan, and Ziyang counties. The military distribution method is to use Jianwei, Jingyan, and Renshou as the first line of defense, Weiyuan, Rongxian, and Ziyang as the second line of defense, and Xufu, Fushun Lixian as the third line of defense. The first line of defense is guarded by Pan Wenhua, the instructor, and Guo Xun, the brigade commander. The second line of defense is guarded by Tang Shizun, the commander of the first division, and Liu Keyu, the brigade commander. The third line of defense is guarded by Wang Zanxu, the commander of the second division, and Liu Congyun, the deputy commander of the model division. The troops of Fan Shaozeng's fourth division and Chen Mingqian's fifth division are used as reserve troops. The distribution has now been completed. On the 19th, Fan Ziying's troops of Liu Xiang's instructional division in Jianwei and Chen Lanting's troops of the border defense army attacked the two brigades of Kou Dengjing and Gao Yuceng of Liu Wenhui's 24th Army. After three hours of fierce fighting, Liu Xiang's army abandoned Jianwei County due to terrain reasons and concentrated on Dapingba, 20 miles away, to confront the 24th Army. On the Renshou side, Guo Xun's brigade of Liu Xiang's instructional division and He Chunwu's brigade of the model division attacked Chen Hongwen's division of the 24th Army. A fierce battle broke out on the 20th. The two sides are still in a stalemate. On the Ziyang side, Li Jiayu of the New Sixth Division and Luo Zezhou of the Twenty-Third Division united and forced</p>
<p>The 24th Army completely occupied the county seat and divided its troops to attack Jianyang, trying to join forces with Deng Xihou of the 28th Army in Chengdu, so the Sichuan war became more and more serious.</p>
<p>At the end of the Sichuan war last year, the various armies held an Neijiang meeting</p>
<p>When the conference was held, a plan to reform the Sichuan situation was drafted, but because there were still many constraints at that time, it was not implemented. Recently, Liu Xiang took the excuse of planning to unify the whole of Sichuan and revised it according to the original plan, establishing the Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee, with one chairman and one vice chairman. Under the committee, there are six offices for military, civil affairs, education, finance, construction, and group affairs. The Supervisory Yuan is still established, but it is crowned with the words "Sichuan Political" and retains the title of Sichuan Post-War Supervisor. When Liu convened the initial meeting in Chongqing, he also proposed it and was approved by representatives from all parties. The candidates were also largely decided. Liu Xiang served as the chairman of the Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee, Deng Xihou served as the vice chairman, Liu Xiang concurrently served as the Sichuan Post-War Supervisor, Tian Songyao was decided to be the director of the Military Affairs Office, Yang Sen was the director of the Civil Affairs Office, Liu Cunhou was the director of the Construction Office, and if Liu Wenhui obeyed, Liu would be the director of the Education Office. Li Jiayu of the New Sixth Division was the director of the Finance Office, Luo Zezhou was the director of the Regiment Affairs Office, and Zhang Qun would still be the director of the Sichuan Political Supervisory Yuan. As for the Sichuan situation after unification, Liu Xiang decided to keep only three armies in the whole of Sichuan. Each army was stipulated to have a total of 100,000 people. Each army directly governs three divisions, each division has 30,000 people, and another machine gun regiment has 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Since Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army failed to quarrel with Liu Xiang of the 21st Army, his position in Sichuan has no longer been valued by all parties. Therefore, this conflict with the 28th Army to seize its tax revenue and territory led to the outbreak of the war in western Sichuan. Although he occupied three or four counties, he suffered considerable losses after a month of stalemate, and aroused criticism from all parties, and even caused Liu Xiang to send troops. At the same time, Tian Songyao of the 29th Army also transferred troops to suppress bandits to help Deng Xihou counterattack. At first, Liu Xiang sent troops just after detaining Yang Sen of the 20th Army and was dissatisfied and raised troops to attack Liu Xiang's defense zone. After that, he aroused Yang Sen's dissatisfaction and sent troops to attack Liu Xiang's defense zone, sympathizing with Liu Wenhui. After Liu Xiang saw that the situation was not good, he quickly sent representatives to dredge up Yang and telegraphed Yang to Chongqing to explain all misunderstandings. Yang felt that he had relied on Liu Xiang's help in recent years and it was inconvenient to turn against him, so he stopped the military deployment and went to Chongqing on the 21st to talk with Liu Xiang and demanded the return of all the detained munitions. Liu Xiang resolutely returned them all and allocated 3,000 new guns as a gift, asking Yang to join forces in the battle to unify the Sichuan situation. Yang has agreed, so Liu Xiang has one less enemy, and Liu Wenhui has a strong enemy, so Liu Wenhui hurriedly moved the troops of the 24th Army to Jiading, and Liu himself went to Chengdu to Jiading to gather the various troops to deploy defenses to respond to the war. It is estimated that there are more than four divisions of Liu Wenhui's army in Jiading, Jianwei, Jingyan, and Renshou. The troops on the Bihe side are also being transferred to southern Sichuan one after another, leaving only a small number of troops to confront the 28th Army across the river. On the Chengdu side, Liu has ordered the abolition of the three-army joint military police group office, and another commander of the First Division of Sichuan and Kang, Leng Yindong, is appointed as the garrison commander to be responsible for the security of the provincial capital. As for the peace conference in Chengdu, Liu Wenhui has expressed his agreement, but Deng Xihou firmly wants Liu to return all the occupied areas before there is room for peace. Liu said that he was seized by Liu Xiang's army in the Sichuan war last year. The defense of more than 40 counties has not yet insisted on returning them. Now, if he occupies three or four counties of the 28th Army, he will have to return them. It is unfair. Therefore, he also expressed his refusal to make peace, so it was hopeless. Liu Wenhui knew that the war would inevitably expand, so he devoted himself to preparing for the war with all his strength. This also shows that a major war is inevitable. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Difficult Problems Facing North China</h3>
<p>The problem of the disposal of puppet troops... The problem of post-disaster relief in the Northwest... The problem of relief in Hebei... The situation of national politics and military affairs is progressing step by step, which is an immutable principle. Although the situation in North China has become more and more complicated recently, it is still based on this principle. Roughly summarized, it is nothing more than the Northeast and Northwest, politics and military affairs.</p>
<p>The so-called Northeast is essentially a problem of the puppet state of the three northeastern provinces. However, since the truce agreement, the problem of the puppet state has not been mentioned for a while, so we retreat to talk about the problem of the truce zone in eastern Hebei. The truce zone has a total of 19 counties, from Fengrun and Yutian to Miyun, all of which are rich agricultural production areas in Hebei. According to the agreement, the Japanese army will first withdraw to the Great Wall line. The word "withdrawal" is very simple in terms of meaning, but in terms of military science, the procedures for withdrawal, the timing of withdrawal, and the various replacements for withdrawal are all extremely important and should be studied. Unfortunately, the original text of the agreement did not include these details, so these kinds of things still need to be contacted verbally. Although it is said to be a small entry and exit, it is a matter of great concern, so those who run around feel more and more effort. Until recently, the Japanese army on the front line of Tongzhou and Shunyi has indeed withdrawn, but the eastern parts of Hebei have not yet been fully withdrawn. According to the agreement, the withdrawal points are maintained by the police, so the authorities initially had a plan for a reception committee, but then they still entrusted the Hebei Provincial Government. The quality of the northern police is well known, but this only refers to the police in Pingjin. As for the four countryside counties, they may not all be top choices, and the police only maintain social security, while the army eliminates bandits. Now that there are no troops in the 19 counties, all responsibilities must be assigned to the police. Moreover, according to the facts, these 19 counties are equal to the enclave zone, where it is not only easy for petty criminals to hide, but also easy for foreign transactions to be attracted. Therefore, the training of the police should be especially noted. It has not been a full month since the truce, and it is difficult to feel difficulties in hastily arranging. Moreover, the puppet army still hangs the five-color flag in the enclave zone in the name of resisting Japan, in order to reap the benefits of the fisherman. As soon as the Japanese army withdraws, they will be liberated. As a result, the defense zone withdrawn by the Japanese army is increasing day by day, and the area taken over by the puppet army is also increasing day by day. At first, it was just a miscellaneous army, but it also formed a special political organization. The puppet army has now set up political institutions in the areas it occupies, and has also set up maintenance committees in various counties to collect food and taxes to supply military needs. The Japanese shirk responsibility for not knowing, and our army has no way to suppress them, which makes them even more powerful. To the fullest extent of the meaning, and to take these 19 counties as the fiefdoms, we know that it is impossible to suppress them, so we change to appease them. However, appeasement is nothing more than two problems: reorganization and funding. Now, in terms of funding, they are asking for 500,000 yuan, saying that 100,000 is to settle the families of the leaders, 100,000 is to provide for the cost of going abroad, and 300,000 is to give to the local soldiers. There have been many cases in recent Chinese political history and on the military stage where a defeat has led to the carrying of funds abroad. Unexpectedly, the puppet army also cites this as a precedent. Now, it is not possible to decide overnight to negotiate the price and make them submit. The matter of reorganization is even more difficult. The puppet army initially did not exceed 10,000 people, but with its bizarre organization, even these 10,000 people already have several army commanders and division commanders to use as capital for publicity. Now, as soon as they hear about the reorganization, they will add some tests in the future and worry about the lack of manpower. Therefore, they are widely recruiting all the scattered soldiers with guns and welcoming them all as the standard for paying the salary during the reorganization. As a result, the number of puppet troops in Japan has increased with the appeasement, or it is said to be 50,000 or 100,000.</p>
<p>People disagree and cannot investigate. However, there must be three or two thousand, which is several times more than before. Li Jichun is originally from Fengrun and has also engaged in political activities in the past, running around and wooing between Zhang and Wu. After retiring from politics, he engaged in business and operated the coal industry, so he had dealings with the Japanese and was quite self-sufficient. I don't know how he suddenly got a strange interest in establishing a puppet army. Now I know that the harvest of the puppet army will not be bad in the end, so I look back and enjoy it, and my reputation is increasing. It is not easy to live in leisure. Now, those who are running around to negotiate the reorganization and demobilization are still people on the old political stage, who have a little connection with them. However, there have been many messengers between Pingjin and there is still no result, which shows that they are not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>The Northwest problem is that Feng rose up suddenly, but now he is going back and forth again to submit. The actions of Feng have been detailed in various reports and cannot be repeated. Tracing back to his original intention, he echoed the two Guangdong provinces from afar. When the Feng army lost its leader, he thought that if he raised his voice, all the mountains would respond and achieve his long-cherished wish. Unexpectedly, after the telegram was sent, there was no enthusiastic response, and he was alone in Zhangkou, with few direct troops. Since he was called an army, he had to reorganize the volunteer army and miscellaneous army that retreated from western Rehe. When the number of people was large, the guns and salaries became difficult, and he almost fell into a dilemma. At that time, the North China authorities believed that it was not the time to use force and decided to solve Feng through political means. Therefore, messengers came and went again. At first, they lived in leisure as private individuals, and gradually became responsible representatives. After several back and forth, they had the plan to retreat to the Linken Supervisor's Office and change their residence to Wanquan County. However, his subordinates who had already formed an army and a division could not help but plan for it, so this plan could not be realized in a short period of time. Only when there is a way to deal with all of them can the Northwest problem be said to have come to an end. As for Feng's old subordinates, such as Han Fuju and Song Zheyuan, from their private standpoint, they still respected him again and again. From the public standpoint, each had a territory and each was a chairman. Who would be willing to re-support the old master to suffer, so in the end, the old subordinates with power mediated and gradually submitted, and the military could not happen. However, the old subordinates such as Ji Hongchang are still homeless and it is still difficult to arrange for them now. I believe that</p>
<p>If we don't find a way in the future, we will never be able to solve it once and for all. In addition to the Northeast and Northwest problems, what is most urgent at present is the problem of relief. In the counties of Hebei that are in the military area, after the war, the residents are completely clear, and the houses have long been burned to the ground. The children and bodies have taken refuge and are displaced on the road, which is unbearable to see. Even those who have not been directly affected by the war have had a large amount of food requisitioned and issued excessively. Wherever the army goes, everything is exhausted. The people of North China support themselves by farming. Once they lose their homes, they will not only have nothing to cultivate, but also nothing to eat, so they will support the old and carry the young, and end up waiting for death on the road. The first way to provide relief is to send the people back, borrow capital to give seeds, and so on. People in various counties in Ping have been calling for a long time. Recently, the central government appointed relief commissioners and also ordered the allocation of 20 million yuan, which can be said to be benevolent. However, the relief commissioners have not yet gathered, convened a meeting to arrange things, and started working, which cannot be done without a considerable period of time. During this time, no one can relieve their suffering. Moreover, the government has already decided that the 20 million yuan will be shared half by Hebei Province and Pingjin City, and the other half will be raised. The local government of Hebei, which has been in the war for a long time, has long been in debt, so how can it have the surplus to raise funds? It is even more difficult to say, so the 20 million is also something that can be expected but not obtained. I don't know when the real benefits will reach the people. Even if we talk about treating the symptoms, sending them back to their hometowns and making some arrangements will require a minimum of 40,000 yuan per county. The 19 counties will already require 760,000 yuan, plus other equipment, which will require no less than 1 million yuan. Therefore, local philanthropists have a plan to raise 1 million first to meet the urgent needs, raising one-third in Pingjin and Shanghai. However, according to actual calculations, Shanghai has made repeated donations, and its strength is almost exhausted. Tianjin and Beiping have been affected by the war, and the raising of more than 300,000 yuan each is not an easy task. In the future, part of it may be allocated from the local group's donations, or the financial and industrial circles may be mobilized first, and then repayment will be planned to form the total amount, which has not yet been finalized. However, with such a poor country and an unprecedented war, millions are needed everywhere in the north and south. The people's strength has been exhausted and it is really difficult to continue. Talking about righteousness today is really an irresistible instruction. (June 21)</p>
<h3>Tense Wuhan Flood Prevention Efforts</h3>
<p>As the Yangtze River continues to rise, the riverbanks of Hankou are submerged, and Wuchang is flooded. The province and city are divided into nine sections to implement emergency rescue and dike reinforcement. The municipal government has initiated joint cooperation between Chinese and foreign authorities. The situation is increasingly tense after communication lines in Hankou, and Jiang'an in Wuchang's Baishazhou, Xiaxinhe, and Hanyang are flooded. The foreign settlements, ten miles long, are in danger of destruction at any moment, and a million residents are in danger of drowning everywhere. The surging river flow continues to increase unabated. The water level recorded at the water gauge station on the 22nd was 45 feet 7 inches, and it reached 46 feet 2 inches on the 22nd, an increase of 5 inches overnight, leaving only a little over 4 inches before overflowing the riverbanks. On this day, the situation at various upstream ports remained stable, with Chongqing at 36 feet 2 inches, Yichang at 39 feet 2 inches, Changsha at 26 feet 6 inches, and Yuezhou at 48 feet 1 inch. Some had already receded slightly or showed no rise. The citizens of Wuhan, like prisoners awaiting judgment, were initially delighted, raising their hands in celebration, believing that since the source had decreased, the water level would naturally subside somewhat. However, by dusk, it had risen another 3 inches. Not only did the disaster area in Wuchang expand, but the Qiaokou, Zongguan, Longwangmiao, and Dakouxiang areas of Hankou were also submerged at river level. If the upstream water flow increases again or if there are storms, the three towns of Wuhan will inevitably be submerged again in a major flood. The inspection situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>(Wuchang Area) Jinshazhou and Baishazhou in Wuchang have already become a watery expanse. Wangshanmen, Wenchangmen, Pinghumen, Hanyangmen, Wushengmen, Dajiekou, and Kuaizijie can still hold about a foot of water due to the slightly higher revetments and embankments. However, the inner street terrain is very low, forming a horizontal line with the river water outside the embankment. The embankments of Dajiekou and Kuaizijie are mostly built of sand with too little yellow earth, making them particularly vulnerable to collapse. The Qingshan Longdi embankment below Xujiapeng is the side barrier of Wuchang. The soil is not firm, and it is likely to leak water. The gates of Wutai Zha and Wannian Zha have long been closed. The water level outside the embankment is about ten feet higher than inside the embankment. There are many places where the gentle slope inside the Wutai Zha embankment is seeping and saturated, and the soil is loose, creating a dangerous situation. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau, because engineer Shi Dupei has not yet returned to Hankou, has not taken any emergency rescue measures. Only the provincial flood prevention committee has sent hundreds of workers to repair it at any time. The provincial flood prevention committee was established on the 22nd, and various groups officially started working on the 23rd. The flood prevention line was designated from Jinkou to Qingshan, about a hundred miles long, with a station every ten miles, a total of nine stations. Each station is assigned one inspector and two patrolmen to patrol day and night. Except for the first, second, third, and fourth stations, which have not yet selected suitable locations, the fifth station is located at Baishazhou Daokou, the sixth station is located at Wutai Zha, and the seventh station is located at Huangwuli. The inspectors at each station have all been assigned. At the same time, 200 laborers were requisitioned and sent to Wufengdi and Wutai Zha for emergency rescue, and representatives were sent to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to negotiate, requesting an initial allocation of 20,000 yuan for use.</p>
<p>(Hankou Area) In Hankou, in addition to Shajie, Longwangmiao, Qiaokou, Zongguan, Niupixiang, Qingjialou, and Dakouxiang, where the water has reached the riverbanks, from Jianghan Pass, Pier One, Special District Three, the French Concession, Special District Two, Special District One, to the Japanese Concession, the distance to the water is either three feet, one foot, or several inches, or it has already reached the sidewalks, depending on the terrain. Flood prevention embankments are being built along the river on the upper planked earth, which can be completed within two days. A section of the dike work in the Japanese Concession is being rushed to completion overnight and is 60-70% complete. The intruding water has also been drained. All companies and foreign firms have built flood prevention fortifications in front of their doors, and wooden gates have been added to the concessions and special districts to prevent emergencies. Zhanggong Dike, which protects the entire city, has experienced dangerous situations in sections seven and eight, and Changfeng Dike has not yet escaped danger. Mayor Wu Guozhen and other flood prevention personnel are traveling to various places to supervise repairs, which is quite effective. The Pinghan Railway passages have also been blocked, and the project is more solid than in previous years because the flooding of the entire city in previous years was actually caused by the collapse of the single-hole gate of that railway, so it is indeed necessary to pay more attention to prevention. The municipal government, for the city's flood prevention plan, previously convened a meeting and decided to divide it into nine flood prevention sections. The flood prevention offices for sections one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven were established first on the 23rd, and the flood prevention offices for sections eight and nine will continue to be established on the 24th. The municipal government sent letters to the Japanese and French consuls and Guo Taizhen, director of the Special District Three Administration, requesting Chinese and foreign cooperation to ensure complete safety. The letter stated: "Recently, the river water has risen sharply, and the danger is worrying. This government has already inspected various sections of the city and paid attention to prevention and blocking, hoping to avoid being hit by floods again. However, the city area is vast, and we are sincerely afraid that our wisdom and consideration are not comprehensive enough and that there may be omissions. Only with concerted cooperation can we ensure complete safety. Regarding the flood prevention situation in your concession area, is there anything that needs to be discussed and assisted with? Please inform us at any time. We will do our best to work together to promote progress. Regarding the flood prevention plan in our city area, if there are any points related to your concession area, we will also consult with the director of your consulate general at any time to coordinate the handling. We hereby send this letter for your perusal and reply."</p>
<p>(Hanyang Area) From Wusheng Temple in Hanyang, passing through the arsenal, to Jijiazui, because there is no solid revetment along the Xiang River, the built earthen dikes are also of uneven height. In low places, the water has reached the riverbanks, and in high places, it is only a few inches away. Below Jijiazui, passing through Ximakou, Qingchuan Pavilion, in front of the Jiangfang Bureau, to outside Dongmen, the riverside houses are all submerged. People mostly take refuge upstairs or move their families. The Gao Gong Bridge holes are also flooded by several inches, and the Parrot Island streets are also a watery expanse.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the flood situation in the three towns of Wuhan. As for the area between the Yangtze River and the Xiang River, the water is turbulent. The ridge in the middle is as high as a mountain. The waves beat the sky, and the sound is deafening. Two small boats capsized and sank under the Yellow Crane Tower. There are not a few other places where this tragedy is being played out. On the 23rd, the Jianghan Customs has notified various shipping companies to further reduce the speed and implement a ban on night navigation. The Jiangxin Wheel, which was scheduled to leave that evening, was temporarily changed to leave eastward at dawn on the 24th. According to those familiar with the water situation at the Jianghan Customs, June is not a flood season, and the level at most has never exceeded 30 feet. This year, it has risen to more than 46 feet, which has not happened in sixty years. As for the reason, although it is because the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers have risen together, the blockage of the Yangtze River channel is the main cause of the disaster. Fortunately, the downstream can still discharge, otherwise Wuhan would have already become a disaster, and so on. Therefore, the disaster caused by the flood is also due to poor planning.</p>
<p>(Counties along the River) Disaster reports from various counties have been pouring in these days. The General Headquarters specifically ordered the administrative commissioners and county magistrates on the 23rd to carefully carry out flood control and allocated 50,000 yuan and 100,000 sacks for distribution to various places for use. The original order is as follows: "According to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau Director Yang Silian's report, it is learned that Hubei Province is known as a watery region and relies on dikes for its life. Since the beginning of summer this year, the water level has been rising without falling. The water level in recent days has been particularly high, exceeding the water level on the same day in the past twenty years by a significant amount. Regarding the flood control materials and expenses for the Jianghan main dike within Hubei Province this year, this bureau has allocated them separately according to the mileage and dangerous conditions of the dike sections under the jurisdiction of each engineering office and has repeatedly telegraphed each office, ordering them to make appropriate arrangements for standby use. We plan to request your department to order the administrative commissioners of each district in Hubei and forward them to the county magistrates of each county with dikes to quickly and carefully protect them to ensure safety. It is reasonable to submit a document and attach a distribution list of materials and labor costs for your department's examination and implementation, which is for the public benefit, and so on. Two copies of the flood control materials and labor cost distribution table are attached to the ministry. According to this, in addition to the instructions and distribution to each commissioner and county magistrate with dikes, we are urgently forwarding the original table and ordering the commissioners and county magistrates to quickly and carefully protect them and report the handling situation at any time. This order ㈠ Expenditure allocation: 4,000 yuan for the First Engineering Office, 4,000 yuan for the Second Engineering Office, 6,000 yuan for the Third Engineering Office, 7,000 yuan for the Fourth Engineering Office, 4,000 yuan for the Fifth Engineering Office, 4,000 yuan for the Sixth Engineering Office, 5,000 yuan for Xindi, 5,000 yuan for Shayang, 6,000 yuan for Wanshi, 2,000 yuan for the Jingjiang Dike Engineering Bureau, 2,000 yuan for Xiangyang Laolong, and 1,000 yuan for Guangji Makou Dam. ㈡ Material allocation: 10,000 sacks, one bundle of palm rope, and one coil of lead wire for the First Engineering Office; the same for the Second Engineering Office and the Third Engineering Office: 15,000 sacks, two bundles of palm rope, and one coil of lead wire; the same for the Fourth Engineering Office and the Fifth Engineering Office: 10,000 sacks, one bundle of palm rope, and one coil of lead wire; the same for the Sixth Engineering Office; 15,000 sacks, one bundle of palm rope, and one coil of lead wire for the Xindi Engineering Office; the same for the Shayang Engineering Office. A total of 100,000 sacks, ten bundles of palm rope, eight coils of lead wire, 300 catties of hemp thread, and 200 needles. (June 23)"</p>
<h3>Wuhu Water Rises, Dikes Collapse</h3>
<p>Over 6,000 Mu of Farmland Flooded. Wuhu Correspondence: Recently, the Yangtze River water level has been increasing without decreasing, coupled with frequent heavy rains and mountain floods. Today (the 23rd), the customs water mark has reached 26 feet 8 inches, an increase of about seven inches compared to the previous two days. In various riverside areas along the river, the water has mostly risen ashore, and most of the thousands of thatched huts along the river beach have been submerged in the water. The sides of South Gate Street and the Second Street roads have also overflowed and flooded the road surface. If it continues to rain in the next few days, the great flood disaster of twenty years ago may revisit, causing extreme panic among the people. Low-lying fields in the four villages have already been inevitably flooded, and newly built but unsound dikes are in danger of collapse at any moment. People have been flocking to the county government to report the danger these days. The Xintang and Hesheng dikes collapsed one after another on the evening of the 22nd, flooding about 6,000 mu of farmland. Wang Baozhai, the administrative commissioner and county magistrate of the Second District, led the dike directors to supervise the laborers and is still trying his best to rescue the situation in an attempt to recover the situation. Yuanze Bridge Dagen, located outside the east gate of Wuyi and facing the river, also had several breaches last night due to mountain floods. Fortunately, the rescue was effective, and it did not cause a disaster. The Xijiang embankment under Yiji Mountain, which borders the Yangtze River, is a barrier for the entire Wuyi polder field. This morning, there were also signs of collapse. The dike chief, who has been on duty for many years, gathered laborers to use reed mats and pile wood to try to block it. If it does not encounter unexpected natural disasters, it may be preserved. Since the flood prevention meeting was held, the county government has ordered the water conservancy trade unions in each district to set up shifts and watchtowers from the 23rd to facilitate timely rescue.

<h3>Jiang Song</h3>
<p>Wei Bridge Arrests Gamblers, Gambler Drowns. Yesterday, a small teahouse in Weiqiao East, which belongs to the Shanghai County area, had villagers gambling as a game. This was reported to the Maqiao Public Security Bureau, which immediately dispatched a patrol chief and seven or eight patrol officers to arrest the gamblers. Three people suddenly saw the police and could not escape, so they jumped into the river one after another. Two of them were familiar with swimming and escaped to the shore. Zhu Quanlin, a resident of Hehang Bridge, did not know how to swim. He was just peering up when a police officer picked up a brick and threw it, sinking him to the bottom of the river. He did not appear for a long time. Then the police officer fired a shot into the sky, and Zhu Quanlin was even more afraid to come out of the water and drowned. This aroused public anger among the Zou people and caused a conflict with the police who came. The turmoil is likely to escalate, and it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Taicang Unfilial Son Beaten to Death by Father</h3>
<p>Wang Ruifu, a farmer living in Jinjiazhai, Jinjiagang, west of Dongxin Bridge outside the South Gate, has a son named Ajin, about thirty years old, who is addicted to opium and does not work. Recently, he has been stealing to make a living because he cannot make a living, resulting in repeated crimes. The day before yesterday, Ajin went to the Bao family at the South Pier to steal again. His father learned about it and, in a moment of anger, took a tree branch and struck Ajin's head hard, killing him on the spot and abandoning the body in a bamboo garden. The South Xiang watchman police heard about it and reported it to the General Bureau, which in turn reported it to the county government. One side arrested and detained Wang Ruifu. Yesterday, Wu Cheng, along with the coroner and others, went to examine the body. It was found that the deceased was indeed beaten to death before his death. The family members were instructed to prepare a coffin and bury the body.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Qingfeng Yarn Factory Flower Warehouse Carelessness</h3>
<p>The Qingfeng Yarn Factory outside the North Gate Zhou Sanbang has been operating prosperously in recent years, with annual surpluses. Last month, a fire broke out in the factory's second workshop, causing losses of over ten thousand. A few days ago, the steam cylinder in the slurry yarn room exploded, causing significant losses. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 23rd) at about 6:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's seventh warehouse. The Guangqin Fire Brigade, sections one and two, heard the alarm, drove the water dragon to rush to the scene, and poured water to put out the fire. The roof had already been burned through, and the houses were tall, making it difficult to get water up, and it could not be extinguished for a while. It was not until after 8:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. Although not much of the accumulated goods in the warehouse were burned, they were all water damaged. The total loss is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Murdered Male Corpse Found on the Qingjiang Road</h3>
<p>There is an old earthen fortress halfway from Qingjiang to Xiba Town, which used to be a hiding place for bandits to ambush travelers. This morning (the 11th), a farmer from Sunjia Dazhuang went to the abandoned fortress to cut green grass to feed his cattle and suddenly discovered a male corpse with incomplete limbs. The head was also missing, leaving only the middle section of the body and chest, with the intestines flowing out. He immediately ran to inform everyone and reported it to the county government, which sent Xiao Cheng to investigate. No relatives of the deceased came to claim the body. It was clearly a murder. The local security was ordered to bury the body.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Executes Notorious Bandit Jiang Depeng</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government previously received a report from the Tenth District Regiment that they had captured the bandit Jiang Depeng in Cangjie Mountain. After investigation, it was confirmed that the bandit was indeed hiding a kidnapped person, harboring guest bandits, privately storing firearms, and engaging in robbery everywhere, sitting and dividing the spoils, and disrupting the security of the area. He was identified as a notorious criminal, recorded his confession, and reported it to the province for review. Now, a secret telegram from Chairman Gu was received, approving the execution of the criminal. Therefore, at 11:00 AM on the 22nd, the criminal was brought out to verify his identity and escorted to the execution ground outside the West Gate to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Xingjia County Public Security Bureau Chief Accused</h3>
<p>The chief of the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau, Xu Yanwu, has been in office for more than a year, with little to show for it. Recently, theft cases have occurred repeatedly inside and outside the city, and although the victims have filed reports requesting investigation, nothing has been solved. As a result, local people have been complaining. On the 15th of this month, the bureau sent a patrol team to the second floor of the Maoxinheng Transportation Company near the East Gate Station and seized four large packages of opium, weighing more than 160 taels in total. The opium dealer Chen Ayi (pseudonym Pan Yueying) was taken to the bureau for questioning. After someone interceded, the amount of opium was reduced to the minimum amount and sent to the local branch court. Chen confessed that she was smoking opium because of illness. The inside story of this matter has now been collected by someone, and certain individuals who are enthusiastic about opium suppression have separately sent telegrams to the provincial department and the Censorate to file accusations.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Student Drowns While Swimming</h3>
<p>Wang Yuanming, a graduating student from the Provincial Public Experiment School, was from Anji and was 24 years old. He was a top student at the school. Yesterday afternoon, after completing the Higher Qualification Examination, he went swimming in the Qingchun Outer City River with three classmates, Xu Liu Xin and others. Due to continuous mold rains, the water rose close to the shore, and Wang swam too far from the shore, resulting in drowning. After being discovered by his classmates, they rushed to rescue him and managed to pull him out, but he was already dead.</p>
<h3>Jinghang National Highway Car Injures Person</h3>
<p>In Yangjiabu, near Wuxing on the Zhejiang section of the Jinghang National Highway, a farmer named Chen Atou was walking through the area at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday when a chassis car with Shanghai license plate number 8194 came speeding from behind and knocked him down, injuring his head and arms, and he fainted on the ground. He was rescued by passersby and reported to the station, which telegraphed Changxing to detain the vehicle, but it was too late. Because Chen's injuries were quite serious, the county requested the Highway Bureau to forward a letter to the Shanghai Public Utility Bureau to detain the vehicle for questioning and compensation for losses.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan House Collapse Injures Four, One Dead</h3>
<p>The Cao family in Waisha, Xixiang, Xiaoshan, moved into the pond on the morning of the 22nd because of the great flood. Unexpectedly, the old house in the pond had been in disrepair for many years and, after a long period of rain, the wall collapsed on the 23rd. Two children, aged seven and five, were unable to escape and were crushed to death. Two women were also seriously injured.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Six Items for Collecting Land Tax Using Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Promulgates Six Reform Measures. The Central News Agency reports: Regarding the abolition of taels and conversion to yuan, after the Ministry of Finance telegraphed all provincial and municipal governments on April 6 to use silver coins for all public and private payments, many localities still calculate the land tax in terms of taels per stone. Therefore, six reform measures were drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to order all provincial and municipal governments to instruct the competent authorities to comply with these measures in the future. The six measures and conversion calculation methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Reform Measures) ㈠ All provincial and municipal governments' land tax collection and surcharges must strictly abolish the tael and stone method in accordance with the general plan for abolishing taels and converting to yuan, and collect according to the standard national currency. ㈡ For busy season grain taxes that are collected by converting taels per stone, the original conversion rate for regular taxes shall be used to revise the rules according to the standard national currency. ㈢ For busy season grain taxes that are collected by valuation, the conversion method shall be calculated in accordance with the telegram from the Ministry of Finance to the provincial and municipal governments in April 22. ㈣ All existing surcharges shall also be converted to national currency along with the regular tax. ㈤ For surcharges or additional levies on regular taxes with a time limit, the original plan shall still be followed, and the levy shall be stopped on schedule, and there shall be no confusion or muddling due to the conversion to national currency calculation. ㈥ This conversion method is limited to completion before the start of the 22nd year.</p>
<p>(Calculation Method) ㈠ For payments originally calculated in silver taels before April 6: One: In Shanghai, the standard shall be 7 dimes and 1.5 li of Shanghai sycee silver, which is converted to one silver dollar, and all payments shall be made in silver dollars. Two: In places other than Shanghai, the Shanghai exchange rate on April 5 shall be used to first convert to Shanghai sycee, and then 7 dimes and 1.5 li of Shanghai sycee shall be converted to one silver dollar as the standard, and all payments shall be made in silver dollars. ㈡ New contracts and notes established after April 6, and all payments and transactions that still use silver taels, are invalid under the law. ㈢ As for those who hold silver taels, please ask the Central Mint to mint silver coins on their behalf in accordance with the regulations on the coinage of silver standard currency, or submit them to the China Central, Communications, and Three Banks in the area for conversion to silver coins for use.</p>
<h3>Improve Surrounding Facilities After Reconstruction of North Station</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, after being approved by the Ministry to rebuild the North Station, has contracted the construction to the China-South Construction Company, which is expected to be completed by the end of August this year. As for the surrounding facilities of the North Station, they should be improved at the same time to enhance the appearance. The Vehicle and Engineering Departments were specially ordered to jointly discuss the improvement, and eight plans have been drafted and approved for implementation. ㈠ The sidewalk in front of Shengshunli will be replaced with cement slabs and trees will be planted. ㈡ The wooden positions of the electric poles on the boundary road sidewalk will be rearranged neatly, and the houses on the side of the road will be repaired. A hexagonal large electric lamp will be added in the center of the four electric lamps above the gate, and trees will be planted along the sidewalk. ㈢ Repair the asphalt road and sidewalk from Baoshan Road to the front of the station building. ㈣ The sidewalk near the boundary road opposite the entrance luggage room will be replaced with cement slabs, all remaining small houses will be demolished, and trees will be planted. ㈤ Remove the advertising signs of the hotels in the station. ㈥ Paint the boiler room at the east end of platform six and remove the bamboo fence. ㈦ The iron fence from the Baoshan Road gate to the Qujiang Road area will be rebuilt into a cement wall. ㈧ All houses between the tracks, except for the Telegraph Bureau and the ground line room, such as the general affairs section storage room, the military police garrison, the engineering office room, the old dispatching office, the cleaning inspection room, the car washing equipment storage room, the mechanical office repair vehicle equipment storage room, the gardener dormitory, etc., will all be demolished.</p>
<h3>Chen Ce Set Sail Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Ce, the former commander of the Guangdong Navy Fleet, who is going to the United States by the President Coolidge to study, resigned last year and has been living in the Beijing and Shanghai areas. Recently, overseas military science has become increasingly developed, so he is going to the United States to travel and study. After returning to Shanghai from Beijing, he boarded the Dollar Line's President Coolidge yesterday (24th) morning and set sail for the United States. Chen is traveling light, and his wife is still living in this city. It is reported that Chen is scheduled to stay overseas for six months before returning to the country.</p>
<h3>Postage to Nanyang Increased</h3>
<p>Postage increase for Nanyang extended by two months. Xinxin News Agency reports that the Ministry of Transportation's increase in postage to Nanyang was originally scheduled to take effect on May 1 this year. However, Chinese overseas in Nanyang protested, so it was postponed to July 1. Now that the implementation date is approaching again, overseas Chinese are still firmly requesting a reversal of the decision. After consultation between the Ministry of Transportation and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, it was decided that the case was related to a resolution of the Executive Yuan and it was inconvenient to violate the government order. However, it was agreed to extend it by another two months to take effect on September 1. The various post offices have been notified.</p>
<h3>Local Negotiations on Chinese Rented Telephones</h3>
<p>In order to cancel the five-cent conversation fee and unify the telephone directory, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has long intended to find a way to cancel the five-cent Chinese and foreign conversation fee and has repeatedly negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Company without success. Yesterday morning, Director Xu, accompanied by Engineer Yu, went to the company again to conduct a second negotiation to discuss the cancellation of the five-cent fee and the unification of the telephone directory. At that time, he met with Gill, the manager of the company, and Fritchman. During the meeting, the company disagreed due to business reasons. After Xu and Yu strongly argued, the company finally agreed to consider it and will continue to discuss it next week. According to Director Xu, this conversation fee is really unnecessary within the same port, and it also causes cumbersome procedures and delays in connecting lines. It is inconvenient for users and increases the burden. The Ministry of Transportation intends to find a way to cancel it for the sake of users and for the sake of serving the public. As for the unified telephone directory method, it is also for the convenience of users. After all, users in the concession and Nanshi must check another directory to make a call, which is also inconvenient. Moreover, there should not be two types of directories in the same city. I will definitely try my best to operate and reduce the burden for users and obtain convenience, and so on.</p>
<h3>Li Zonghuang Passes Through Shanghai to Return to Beijing</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Li Zonghuang, who was assigned to inspect party affairs in Vietnam, has completed his work. He arrived in Shanghai on the Coolidge President Wheel from Hong Kong the day before yesterday and is scheduled to return to Beijing by special express train this morning.</p>
<h3>Improve Surrounding Facilities After Reconstruction of North Station</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has contracted the construction to the China-South Construction Company after the Ministry approved the reconstruction of the North Station. It is expected to be completed by the end of August this year. As for the surrounding facilities of the North Station, they should be improved at the same time to enhance the appearance. The Vehicle and Engineering Departments were specially ordered to discuss the improvement together, and eight plans have been drafted and approved for implementation. ㈠ The sidewalk in front of Shengshunli will be replaced with cement slabs and trees will be planted. ㈡ The wooden positions of the electric poles on the boundary road and on this will be rearranged neatly, and the houses on the side of the road will be repaired, and a hexagonal large electric lamp will be added in the center of the four electric lamps above the gate, and trees will be planted along the sidewalk. ㈢ Repair the asphalt road from Baoshan Road to the front of the station building. ㈣ The sidewalk near the boundary road opposite the entrance luggage room will be replaced with cement slabs, all remaining small houses will be demolished, and trees will be planted. ㈤ Remove the advertising signs of the hotels in the station. ㈥ Paint the boiler room at the east end of platform six and remove the bamboo fence. ㈦ The iron fence from the Baoshan Road gate to the Qujiang Road area will be rebuilt into a cement wall. ㈧ All houses between the tracks, except for the Telegraph Bureau and the ground line room, the general affairs section storage room, the military police garrison, the engineering office room, the old dispatching office, the cleaning inspection room, the car washing equipment storage room, the mechanical office repair vehicle equipment storage room, the gardener dormitory, etc., will all be demolished.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce to Convene General Meeting Today</h3>

It is reported that twenty-five proposals from various trade associations have been received and included in the agenda. The most important ones are the implementation of promoting domestic goods and paying attention to the collection of disguised likin taxes in various provinces and cities. In addition, there are several proposals regarding various industries requesting tax reductions. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>）Important Proposals（ (Implementing the Resolution of the Previous Domestic Goods Promotion Conference, Starting with Investigation and Imposing Appropriate Sanctions on Those Who Violate the Resolution) It was decided at the Third General Meeting of Members of this Chamber in June last year that the task of this Chamber should be concentrated on promoting domestic goods to find a way out for merchants. From the perspective of merchants and the industry of each member of this Chamber, some are producers and some are vendors. Merchants engaged in production are also consumers, such as the raw materials used by factories. If merchants who manufacture domestic goods in this Chamber work hard to produce, while merchants who handle sales and transportation prefer to order cheap foreign goods for dumping, or if manufacturers need raw materials and clearly have domestic goods that can be ordered, but do not purchase from merchants who handle sales and transportation, then the goal of promoting domestic goods will still be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the so-called promotion of domestic goods requires all merchants to work together with one heart. If there is a slack in one part, the entire plan will inevitably fail. The failure to achieve significant results in promoting domestic goods over the past year is due to this problem. It is necessary for this Chamber to have precise statistical surveys on the content of various industries in order to clarify which members have strictly complied with the resolution and which have violated it secretly. This matter is stipulated in Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law as one of the duties that the Chamber of Commerce should perform, and the Second General Meeting of Members of this Chamber also resolved to expedite commercial statistics. Based on the above circumstances, the implementation of commercial surveys should not be delayed any further. The following are draft investigation methods: ㈠ Instruct the Commercial Affairs Department to create detailed forms, supervise and lead various trade associations to handle investigation and statistics separately, and assist in the process by the Commodity Exhibition Hall and the Domestic Goods Promotion Committee, and list the commodity components of various factories and merchants obtained from the investigation into statistics and announce them to all sectors, so that consumers know what to choose. ㈡ Those who resist the investigation of this Chamber, or who are found to have violated the resolution on promoting domestic goods after the investigation, will be regarded as violating the resolution of this Chamber and harming the reputation and credit of this Chamber, and will be subject to sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Articles 12 and 19 of the Articles of Association of this Chamber, and may be notified to all industries and cut off all economic relations with them. ㈢ Those who should be expelled due to violating the behavior of promoting domestic goods will be authorized by the General Meeting of Members to the Executive Committee for handling, and will still be submitted to the next General Meeting of Member Representatives for ratification. ㈣ This Chamber should notify all industries to include promoting domestic goods and obeying the investigation of this Chamber into the industry regulations. Those who violate the regulations will be punished by the respective associations in accordance with the penalties for violating industry regulations and submit the measures for approval. The above measures are intended to make it easier to implement and effective the resolution on promoting domestic goods in the previous session. Whether it is appropriate should be decided by the General Meeting. (Proposed by the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees) ㈡ It is proposed to request the central government to abolish likin and other similar taxes newly established by various provinces and cities after this abolition, and to establish a special committee for the study of taxes and donations in this Chamber to alleviate commercial difficulties. The order to abolish likin, such as in Sichuan and other provinces, has not been followed, and even if it is claimed to have been abolished, various names have been cleverly created for disguised likin, such as the production and sales tax in Cizhou, Jiangxi, and the special business tax on bricks and ash in Jiangsu Province, and the collection of fishery construction fees in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces, and the inspection fees for ham and cured meat in this city. Although the names are different, they are all taxes levied on goods, and the tax rates are mostly similar to likin, and some are even higher than likin. The above items have been presented by this Chamber to the national government for forceful contention. Only the Cizhou ceramic industry production and sales tax in Jiangxi was changed to a business tax and collected by merchants, and the rest have not been adequately resolved. In addition to continuing to strive for a total solution, it is also planned to request the central government to prevent and stop such situations and not allow them to undermine the likin general plan. As the tax situation in various provinces is complicated, it is necessary to investigate the facts and base them on laws and regulations. It is proposed to establish a special committee to handle it, so that efficiency can be improved. Whether it is appropriate should be decided by the General Meeting. (Proposed by the Standing Committee of this Chamber) ㈢ It is proposed that the General Meeting resolve to authorize the Executive Committee to organize (1) commercial, (2) industrial, and (3) financial research committees. The commercial and economic situation is becoming increasingly complex due to international transportation. In addition to the facts, it is necessary to explore theories and understand the world situation. This Chamber has always involved specialized issues and collected opinions from various related industries. In fact, various industries often do not have sufficient preparation in advance. After repeated reminders, they only reluctantly respond. The Shanghai business community is known as the crown of the country. If this shortcoming is not urgently corrected, then there will be no preparation to know ourselves and the enemy in peacetime. How can we stand in the international market and compete for survival by digging wells when thirsty? The intention of this case is to concentrate specialized talents for separate research, so that when a major problem arises, we can make accurate and powerful claims. Whether it is appropriate should be decided by the General Meeting (Proposed by Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong). This case does not need to be resolved by labor (A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency went to inquire about this matter yesterday from Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, who is handling this case. Regarding the International Labor Conference in Geneva, the Chinese representative Xiao Jilao proposed a motion stating that "the Conference should request the managing country to request the governments of the countries concerned to ensure that Chinese and foreign industrial and commercial enterprises in concessions and leased territories comply with China's labor regulations." Whether this indirectly promotes the inspection of factories in the concessions of this city by the International Labor Conference, Yu replied that the issue of factory inspection in this city has already been resolved between the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council and absolutely does not require any resolution from the International Labor Conference to indirectly resolve this issue, and the International Labor Conference has repeatedly stated that all Chinese and foreign factories in concessions or leased territories within Chinese territory are subject to the administration of China's Factory Law. The Municipal Government also based its judgment on the statement of the Labor Conference to promote the attention of the Municipal Council, Yu said, and elaborated on the history of the Chinese factory problem after the International Labor Conference was established to prove it.</p>
<p>(Citing International Labor Recommendations) Yu said that after the end of the European War, various countries signed the Treaty of Versailles, which included provisions for the International Labor Organization. China also signed the treaty at that time, and all signatory countries are members of the International Labor Organization. According to the treaty, the first International Labor Conference was held in Washington in 1919. At that time, a special national committee was established to discuss labor issues in the Far East. Regarding China, there were the following two recommendations: ㈠ It is hoped that the Chinese government will adopt the principle of protecting workers with a factory law. ㈡ The International Labor Conference should negotiate with the countries concerned to make them enjoy the same methods in the concessions and leased territories or by the regulations of those countries. When the Chinese government formulates factory laws, the Chinese government may implement them in the concessions and leased territories. Subsequently, China promulgated the Provisional Factory Regulations in 1923 to protect workers. The International Labor Office, based on the second resolution in the report of the aforementioned special national committee, notified the Chinese government twice in April 1921 and December 1923 that the bureau intends to contact the powers that have concessions and other interests in China and obtain recognition from the Chinese government. In June 1924, the Chinese government stated that Article 2 of the Provisional Factory Regulations of China stipulates that all foreign factories established within the territory of the Republic of China, if other than those stipulated in Article 1, should also abide by these regulations. Therefore, these regulations naturally apply to all factories in the concessions. However, in reality, due to the obstruction of the concession authorities, the regulations could not be implemented in the concessions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Inspection Group from Java</h3>
<p>Returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou, heading to Beijing this morning. According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Overseas Chinese Industrial Inspection Group from Dutch Java in Southeast Asia arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and stayed at the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road. The group members included Ye Weiheng, Chairman of the National Salvation and Disaster Relief Association of the Dutch East Indies, and overseas Chinese merchants Shi Ruizhen, Chen Ruiji, Shi Weisong, and Mrs. Xu, a total of eight people. After boarding the ship in Java, they went to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai by ship. The Chinese Red Cross Society on Jiujiang Road held a banquet at Xinghualou the other day to entertain them because the overseas Chinese merchants in the area had donated a lot of money for the rescue of wounded soldiers and refugees during the Songhu Battle. They also reported in detail the amount of donations received from overseas Chinese merchants in various places and the use of the relief funds. The group members were very satisfied. Dr. Wang Peiyuan, the medical director of the society, also injected the group with vaccinations to prevent any eventuality. The group members decided to take the early express train to Beijing this morning. After arriving in Beijing, they plan to stay for a week and then return to Java via Japan, the Philippines, etc., it is said.</p>
<h3>China General Confederation of Industry</h3>
<p>Sending Zhou Mingzhuo to Europe and the United States for inspection. The China General Confederation of Industry believes that production has been declining in recent years and there is a lack of talent in management. Therefore, in the spring of this year, it jointly organized an industrial training class with the Business School of Soochow University to recommend important employees from all member factories to enroll. After training for half a year, they achieved excellent results and will be able to graduate and return to work in the factory at the end of the month. In addition, in order to study the scientification of management, it announced yesterday that it would send Zhou Mingzhuo, general manager of Qingdao Huaxin Yarn Factory, to factories in various European and American countries for on-site inspections, and to visit industrial leaders in various places on behalf of the association, so that it can organize a scientific factory management organization after returning to China in the future, so that the effective customs of Western countries can be realized in our country as soon as possible. Zhou graduated from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Cornell University in the United States and has been in charge of Huaxin Factory in Qingdao for six or seven years. The fine yarn produced is known as the best in China, and the thread is especially popular with domestic needle and iron factories in general. As for the government, it also believes that the association's personnel selection is appropriate and has an important mission to go abroad, and also approved the association's request to grant the title of Industrial Investigator of Europe and the United States to show respect.</p>
<h3>Displaced Overseas Chinese from Mexico</h3>
<p>Left Shanghai yesterday morning to return to their hometown. The seventh batch of 28 overseas Chinese, including Huang Chuan Nian, who were expelled from Mexico and arrived in Shanghai, came to Shanghai at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. The Overseas Chinese General Association sent people to receive them. Because these people are all from Guangdong Province and need to be sent back to their hometowns, the Overseas Chinese General Association sent Huang and the other 28 people to the original ship, the President Jackson, at 9:00 PM the night before yesterday. The ship left Shanghai for Hong Kong at 3:00 AM yesterday. The Overseas Chinese General Association also telegraphed the Huadong Hospital, which is invested in by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, to receive the displaced overseas Chinese immediately after they arrive in Hong Kong and send them to Guangdong, it is said.</p>
<p>Graduates of the Central Political School</p>
<h3>Going to the Municipal Council to Intern in Municipal Administration in Various Departments</h3>
<p>Dr. Jia Lun, President of the Central Political School, corresponded with the Municipal Council of the Public Concession to send six outstanding graduates of the school's Department of Political Science and Municipal Administration to the Municipal Council to intern in municipal administration in various departments. After soliciting opinions from the heads of various departments, they all expressed their willingness to strongly support the Municipal Council. The Board of Directors approved the plan at a meeting on Wednesday. The students will come to Shanghai to intern starting on July 1 for a period of four months, taking turns to go to various departments to practice. During the internship, they will be supervised and guided by the heads of the departments, it is said.</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang of Sichuan Plans to Build a Steel Plant</h3>
<p>The rumor that Sichuan representatives signed a contract with the Hope Company is not true. Yesterday's report stated that Liu Xiang, Governor of Sichuan, planned to build a steel plant and signed a contract with the German Hope Company. According to Kang Daofu, the representative of the Hope Company in China, the Hope Company only signed a contract with the Ministry of Industry to build the Central Steel Plant and did not conduct similar plans with any other party. Therefore, everything reported is completely untrue. Kang was very surprised by the news, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Talks</h3>
<p>Next year's budget is expected to be balanced, and the deficit has been compensated for. Regarding the budget for the city of 1933, which will have a deficit of more than 2 million yuan, a reporter from the Central News Agency asked Secretary-General Yu about this matter. According to Yu, the municipal government has solutions to this deficit. The solutions will be nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditures. The income from land prices can be increased by more than 1 million yuan. Generally, it can be implemented next year. Business taxes and house taxes will also be effectively reorganized, and the amount of income can be increased. All administrative expenses of the municipal government and various bureaus will be reduced as much as possible, so it is hoped that no public bonds will be issued next year, and the income and expenditure will be balanced, it is said.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Director, Lei Wenjun, Asks for Leave</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Director Lei Wenjun said to the Board of Directors that he would be leaving Shanghai between July and August, and if necessary, he could resign from his position as director, but the Board of Directors will have its regular recess in August, so the General Manager intended to ask Lei Wenjun not to resign. All the directors unanimously agreed.</p>
<h3>Reason for Japanese Soldiers Filling Earth at the Intersection of Tongji Road</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Tiantong'an Road and Tongji Road in Zhabei, the Doi Flower Garden next to the Japanese Marines was destroyed during the January 28th Incident last year. It was recently learned that the team plans to rebuild the Doi Flower Garden and arrange a tennis court, etc. Therefore, the team's soldiers have been filling the garden with earth these days, it is said.</p>
<h3>Municipal Joint Association Asks for Postponement of House Tax Collection on North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>And requested the relocation of the branch director. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Joint Association submitted a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday regarding the strike on North Sichuan Road and sent a letter to the Shanghai Provisional Council. The original text reads: Respectfully submitted, This time, the strike on North Sichuan Road, the association [our association] saw the report and the citizens of the area requested it, recognizing that the situation in the area is complicated and the situation is serious, and dared not abide by the戒 of inaction, driven by the intention to maintain the city's appearance and public security, the supervisory committee members of the association [our association] Qia Qing, etc., went to petition and persuade separately. We dare to make the following statements: ㈠ The house tax in the North Sichuan Road area should be collected according to law, but under the following circumstances, it seems that the old custom can be temporarily maintained: (A) The road built across the border has not been recovered. (B) No guarantee has been obtained from other agencies that municipal general donations will not be collected. (C) No arrangement has been made for the uniform collection of house tax from the citizens in the area. (D)</p>
<p>The external threats that exist and are possible have not been lifted. As for whether the citizens in the area do not love the country and do not hope for the implementation of national laws and regulations, as can be seen from the facts such as the removal of the barrier blocking the traffic to Sichuan Road, the removal of the doorplates of non-municipal agencies, and the collection of more than 900 yuan to donate to the relocation of the district branch to its current location, it seems that it can be said to be no problem. ㈡ Chen Jiwu, the director of the second branch of the fifth district, should be dealt with according to law, or at least be transferred, (A) because he is respectful to foreign residents and arrogant to his own citizens. (B) Because of violating Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution, he detained four citizens for more than 24 hours and did not provide food or drink. The family's delivery of soup and rice was rejected on the pretext of refusal to accept it. (C) Because of hearing impairment, he mistakenly heard the authorities' phone call as not releasing them. Recently, President Wang of the Executive Yuan of the National Government sent a telegram to the Beiping Political Affairs Branch with a proverb to appease the people and strictly control the officials. Those who have the responsibility to appease the people and control the officials must regard it as the most important rule. The colleagues of the association [our association], although residing in the special zone, are all people governed by the same municipal government. Their experiences are more relevant and their interests are related. We hereby inform [your association] to examine and handle it according to law (according to law.</p>
<p>Council) It is truly a public sentiment (truly a public friendship)</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to Customs to Improve the Valuation of Imported Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Jianghai Customs yesterday, requesting that the method of valuing imported goods be improved to avoid delays. The original text reads: Dear Sir, On the 23rd of this month, we received a letter from the Clock and Watch Industry Association stating that our member companies recently ordered goods from foreign factories, but when they arrived at the port, the Jianghai Customs deliberately made things difficult in the valuation, which often led to delays, missed opportunities, and unspeakable impact on business. They reported to the association for assistance in droves. After checking the goods, the tax has a certain standard, or it should be taxed according to the price, and it should be handled according to the invoice. Even if it is sometimes doubtful, the method of consular certification may be adopted. If the Jianghai Customs believes that consular certification is not sufficient, then it may follow the Japanese method of taxing by piece. In short, the most important thing for merchants in business is timing. The factory invoice is always true. Our association believes that the members of the same industry are affected by the Jianghai Customs' difficult valuation and affect their business, so we put forward the above-mentioned methods, which are nothing more than seeking quick and convenient access to goods for the same industry, and propose special letters to your association, requesting that the Jianghai Customs be informed to adopt and implement it immediately, so that the same industry will no longer have delays in valuation and avoid business losses. After checking the reports to the association, the association's proposed sections are for the convenience of valuation and to avoid delaying time. The method is based on the precedents of other countries and should be beneficial to tax revenue. We should write to your department to discuss with the tax department to adopt and implement it.</p>
<p>&gt;Guangdong three groups telegraphed to request a speedy and peaceful solution to the Taikoo strike</p>
<p>The Guangzhou Public Hall and others sent a telegram to the Guangdong authorities: Guangzhou sent to the Southwest Executive Department, Provincial and Municipal Party Department, Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan, Chairman Lin Yunga, Mayor Liu Jiwen, Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, Seamen's Union, Henan Machinery General Association, Labor General Association, Hong Kong Tung Wah Hospital, Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Shipping Association, for your consideration. Recently, all industries in Guangdong have universally stated that due to the Taikoo Steamboat seamen's strike, cargo transportation has been suspended and the inventory in the warehouses is feared to deteriorate. Not only will merchants suffer losses, but also the people's food and daily use will be affected. If this stalemate continues, Guangdong's finances will inevitably be in danger. Please send a joint telegram to request a speedy solution, etc. After investigation, the country is now in deep trouble, and it is appropriate to circulate cargo transportation to enrich the people's livelihood and to comply with the purpose of commercial salvation of the country. Moreover, Taikoo was very enthusiastic in providing assistance during the previous floods in Guangdong and transporting food to relieve the people of Guangdong, and it did not hesitate to donate large sums of money for charitable deeds in Guangdong. It also transported refugees back to their hometowns at low prices every year in large numbers. Therefore, we telegraphed to request a speedy method to peacefully resolve it, so as to benefit commercial transportation and maintain finance. Shanghai Guangzhou Public Hall, Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, Guangdong Association in Shanghai, bowing, Yang.</p>
<h3>Conference of Representatives of Two Railway Employees</h3>
<p>Drafted reasons to oppose performance-based salary increases and requested the union to forward them to the Two Railway Bureaus for verification.</p>
<p>In order to request the fulfillment of the annual salary increase in 1933, the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways organized a salary increase delegation and sent representatives to petition the Railway Bureau. As a result, the Railway Bureau replied that it would handle it in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Railways (performance-based salary increase). The railway employees expressed dissatisfaction. Therefore, at 5:00 PM yesterday, a delegation meeting was held at the Two Railway Unions. More than 20 representatives attended. After a long discussion by Chairman Zhou Pengju, 15 reasons to oppose the performance-based salary increase issue were agreed upon and requested the Two Railway Unions to forward them to the bureau for verification. The reporter from Xin Xin News Agency recorded the original text as follows: ㈠ At the beginning of the railway employees' career, they were all young students with fewer burdens, so the salary was small, but it was enough to support themselves. This is why the employees were willing to get a small salary and serve the railway. ㈡ Moreover, since the establishment of the two railways, there has been a fixed annual salary increase, so as to stimulate their ambition to compete, encourage their spirit of work, and also maintain the increase in their annual living standards. ㈢ According to the past practice of salary increase and performance evaluation, those who have worked for one year are given a salary increase if they have no faults. The restrictions are clear and not comparable to ordinary salary increases. This is the first reason to maintain the past practice. ㈣ Moreover, when the railway employees first joined the railway, the salary was very small. Those who have worked for more than ten years</p>
<p>The income is not as good as the initial salary of newcomers. Those who can serve with peace of mind maintain the hope of annual salary increases. This is the second reason to maintain the past practice. ㈤ If it is said that compared with other salary-arrearage and salary-reduction agencies, the starting salary method of the two railways is different from other railways. This is the third reason to maintain the past practice. ㈥ Moreover, if they all belong to railway employees, how can there be a distinction between employees? The so-called employees are those with a monthly salary of 10 or 20 yuan, and the so-called workers are those with a monthly salary of more than 100 yuan. How can there be an inherent name for employees, and their lives can be stretched? This is the fourth reason to maintain it. ㈦ If it is said that it is based on the order of the Ministry of Railways, then this order was issued as early as May 30, 1920. Why were salary increases made in accordance with the past practice in 1920, 1921, and 1922? It has been clearly shown that the past practice is good and does not conflict with the order of the Ministry of Railways at all. It has been tacitly approved and has become a precedent that can be followed. This is the fifth reason to maintain it. ㈧ If it is said that the previous methods were inappropriate or misunderstood by the past directors, then when Director Huang took over, Director Chen had just left his post due to the undecided salary increase in the Shanghai-Hangzhou section. Why did he still follow the past practice after taking over? It shows that Director Huang also recognizes the propriety of the past practice. This is the sixth reason to maintain it. ㈨ If it is said that the railway revenue is short, it is not the employees' fault. The extravagant expenses are in the employees' cycle of remuneration, and there is no possibility of increasing a large number of expenditures. The current situation is caused by too many private individuals, and the monthly salary is often hundreds of yuan. ㈩ Even according to the order of the Ministry of Railways, those who have worked for one year are allowed to evaluate the addition, then those who were given a salary increase in January of the year should have evaluated the addition at the end of December last year. Why did they wait for the joint submission of the employees to ask the bureau to continue to exert pressure and not accept it? They waited for the employees to petition before announcing the order for performance-based salary increase. The method is still specified. What is the office in charge of the bureau's work doing in the past six months? ㈩㈠ Now it has been changed to performance evaluation at the end of June and the end of December, which has reduced the benefits that should have been obtained for half a year. This is why the current salary increase method cannot be accepted. ㈩㈡ The employees are not very clear about the illegality of the so-called delegation. They only know that our purpose is bright. ㈩㈢ Moreover, the delegation represents the will of the employees of the entire railway. If it is said that it is not in compliance, we should study the reasons for the formation of the assembly and the delegation. In short, the bureau has no sincerity to the employees. ㈠ The salary increase should have been given in January, but it was not given. ㈡ Forced to submit a joint request in May, but no reply or announcement of the method was given. On the contrary, high-pressure measures were used to stop it. Therefore, the director of the bureau should be fully responsible for all non-compliance. ㈩㈣ In the period of political tutelage, the people's freedom of assembly is recorded in the Provisional Constitution. Moreover, this group is under the leadership of the union and is recognized by the party headquarters. Is it not</p>
<p>Is it illegal? ㈩㈤ If the director does not want to talk in the name of a representative, he should also admit the qualifications of the railway employees. When petitioning, he did not want to express it clearly, and then he dealt with it with vague and divisive means. If unfortunately an accident occurs, the bureau should bear full responsibility.</p>
<h3>Mai Station Resumes Contractor System, Dispute Unresolved</h3>
<p>(Union's Response to the Railway Bureau's Clarification) (Contractor Reportedly Earns a Hefty Profit of Two Thousand Yuan Per Month) Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau's decision to abolish the Mai Station Loading and Unloading Workers' Cooperative and reinstate the contractor system has caused significant disputes, as previously reported. Yesterday, a Xin Xin News Agency reporter met with a responsible person from the union, who stated that the Railway Bureau is using propaganda to deceive the public, attempting to cover up everything. The union initially did not want to engage in much debate, but fears that the outside world may not understand the situation on this railway, so it is making these erroneous points clear to the public to set the record straight.</p>
<p>) Contractor and Contracting Differentiated (The Railway Bureau claims that the contractor system is not a contractor system, the key point being a regulation that stipulates the contractor's expenses and compensation are only extracted from 10% of the loading and unloading fees. This statement is truly dishonest. It is particularly memorable that the union representatives, led by Luo Bing and Chen Bohua, met with Director Huang on the 9th, stating that 20% of the loading and unloading fees would be taken by the contractor. At the time, there was no mention of adding two more percentage points for the merchants. However, in the current clarification, only the addition of two percentage points is mentioned, and there is no mention of the additional 20% deduction. Why is this? The Mai Station's loading and unloading fees are about 5,000 yuan per month during this lean season. Even with just the added two percentage points, the contractor can easily earn a profit of 1,000 yuan per month. Adding the 20% deducted from the workers, the contractor can earn 2,000 yuan per month. In peak months, the figure could be as high as 8,000 or 9,000 yuan. According to the principle of abolishing the contractor system, which is to "eliminate exploitation of workers" and "eradicate unearned income," the so-called contractor can both exploit workers according to regulations and enjoy a hefty profit. How can this not be a contractor system?</p>
<p>(Insufficient Reasons for Abolition) The main reason for abolishing the cooperative is said to be poor performance during the four-year trial period. It is unknown what constitutes "performance" or what the basis for "poor" is. Moreover, Article 28 of the Railway Bureau's regulations states that if there is a violation of the regulations, a review meeting should be convened to improve the situation. The Railway Bureau has not mentioned any issues with the cooperative's performance on a regular basis, nor has it convened a review meeting. Now, it is abruptly abolishing the cooperative based on the vague statement of "poor performance." How can this be considered a valid reason? In the first half of the clarification, it is stated that the case files were destroyed during the January 28th Incident. However, when explaining the cooperative, Article 26 of the regulations appears intermittently, demonstrating a contradiction.</p>
<p>) Inaccurate Comparison of Benefits (It is unknown on what basis it is claimed that the foreman is a contractor and that workers are exploited by them. The claim that the decrease in freight volume is the responsibility of the workers is self-defeating (as stated in the branch declaration). Why must the contractor be able to increase freight volume? How is it known that they can increase revenue? Does the Railway Bureau have foresight? The close relationship between the Railway Bureau and the contractor is evident, which is why the Railway Bureau is so generous to the contractor and so stingy to the workers.</p>
<p>(Process of Various Price Increases) The Railway Bureau claims that the cooperative has engaged in various violations over the past four years, extorting merchants and creating various charges. However, the issue of whether to increase the price of sorting, packing, and weighing imported and exported goods was jointly discussed by representatives from the Transportation Department, transportation industry representatives, and cooperative representatives on May 25, 1929, and announced under Vehicle Document No. 799, which became a confirmed regulation. Merchants have not complained, and the cooperative has never taken a single extra cent outside of the regulations. How can the Railway Bureau falsely accuse the cooperative of extortion? If this is considered extortion, then the Railway Bureau is also teaching workers to extort. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the truth, the regulations announced under Vehicle Document No. 799 are attached below. Vehicle Document No. 799: To whom it may concern, On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, this office convened representatives from the Shanghai Transportation Association and representatives from the Mai Gen Road Station Cooperative Loading and Unloading Workers to jointly establish regulations regarding the increase in prices for loading and unloading various imported and exported goods.

<p>(Forcible Handover with Military Pressure) It is very common for contractors to take over, and it is sufficient to order the resident railway police to prevent and maintain city security. The armed forces of the Municipal Security Office and the Public Security Bureau seem unnecessary. What is the use of the Railway Bureau sending a letter to ask them to come if it is not to force a handover? The workers' actions are civilized and orderly, as has been seen in the facts since July. It is too arbitrary to say that the foremen cannot control the workers.</p>
<p>(Also a Little Explanation) Our position is under the strict supervision of the Director, so we can only answer based on facts and cannot speak arbitrarily like the Director, which would lead to severe criticism. However, in order to make society understand our suffering and to avoid being unjustly accused, we must clarify the truth. What ability do workers have to influence social, economic, and livelihood issues? The workers would never dare to admit this. The workers believe that (1) the decrease in freight volume is related to natural and man-made disasters. Moreover, it is not just Mai Station that is like this; the national freight volume is also in the same situation. (2) Merchants are hesitant; this is probably one-sided. It is heard that the Railway Bureau recently sent freight inspector Liang Yuheng to various transshipment companies to request them to send letters to the Railway Bureau, accusing the workers of various crimes, in order to prove this claim. Fortunately, all transshipment companies understand the situation and were not used, unanimously rejecting this. Otherwise, if the Railway Bureau had concrete evidence to present, the workers would have no room for defense. Why bother working hard every day? (3) The workers are breaking the law; nothing was found out beforehand, and the Railway Bureau itself failed to supervise and did not repent. Instead, it blamed the workers, which is almost a strong argument. (4) The workers' lives are currently insufficient, but they hope that the situation will be peaceful and that freight will be developed to compensate for this. The Railway Bureau is not thinking about the workers themselves, but is using the contractor system, which exploits the workers, to regulate them. Who would believe this?</p>
<h3>Municipal Farmers' Association Calls for a National Farmers' Association Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, in view of the decline in agricultural production and the bankruptcy of the rural economy in recent years, and the fact that the government has been actively carrying out reconstruction work together with all sectors, believes that farmers themselves should catch up and strive for self-salvation. Therefore, it advocates convening a joint meeting of farmers' associations from all provinces and cities across the country to discuss self-salvation strategies and elect representatives from the agricultural sector to the Sino-American Cotton and Wheat Loan Management Committee to promote the realization of the use of foreign capital and the development of agriculture.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Urges Collection of Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Solicitation Team has decided to conclude its work within the month. The Shanghai Solicitation Team of the Chinese Aviation Association has decided to conclude its work within the month and has issued a notice requesting that the donations raised by each sub-team be submitted to the office before the end of the month, or to the Bank of China Communications and other banks designated by the association. The association also sent a letter to each designated bank yesterday to open a custodial account for the Aviation Association Fund in order to pay the US$22,000 per plane (equivalent to about 80,000 silver dollars) for the eighteen fighter planes purchased by the association from the Curtis Company in the United States, totaling over one million yuan. Currently, the full amount has not been paid because the donations have not been fully collected. It is planned that the first plane will be paid for first after the solicitation team concludes its work, and then the remaining amount will be paid after the goods arrive.</p>
<h3>Yang Xingfo's Funeral Scheduled</h3>
<p>To be buried in Yong'an Cemetery on July 2, to be organized by the Science Society of China. Central News Agency reports that after the assassination of Mr. Yang Xingfo, Director-General of the Academia Sinica, his coffin was placed in the Universal Funeral Home on the 20th of this month. Friends from afar who came to Shanghai to pay their respects included Mei Yi-qi, President of Tsinghua University, and Duan Xipeng, Vice Minister of Education. The Academia Sinica has established Mr. Yang's funeral office to assist Mr. Yang's family in handling the funeral affairs. Due to Mr. Yang's poverty after his death, the academy allocated 2,000 yuan for funeral expenses and appointed Zhou Zijing as the director and Ding Xielin as the chief receptionist. In addition to family members and colleagues from the academy taking on various duties, Wang Wenbo, Hu Xiansheng, Li Gufan, Guo Chengzhi, Yang Yunzhong, and others were also invited to assist in everything. It has now been decided that the service will be held at the Universal Funeral Home from 8:00 am to 2:30 pm on July 2, and the announcement will be made on the 3rd of this month for the funeral procession to be buried in the Yong'an Cemetery. Colleagues from the academy will hold a public memorial service on July 1 and lower the flag to half-mast for one day to express their condolences. The funeral office will be located in the funeral home and will send people to take turns to preside over the funeral starting tomorrow. In addition, Mr. Yang had many friends and colleagues during his lifetime, and it is difficult to distribute obituaries to everyone, so it has been decided to publish a substitute obituary. All kinds of ceremonies will be simplified because Mr. Yang was frugal and self-disciplined during his lifetime. The Science Society of China, as the founder of the society, has dedicated his life to the cause of the society without懈, so the society will hold a public funeral in the name of the society and appoint Ren Shuyong, Tang Bohuang, Wang Jiliang, Zhou Zijing, and Yang Yunzhong as five funeral committee members.柳翼谋 will draft the eulogy, which will be held on the afternoon of July 1. The society has decided to edit Mr. Yang Xingfo's memorial publication and promote Tang Bohuang to preside over it, and hang Mr. Yang's oil portrait in the Mingfu National Library to留纪念. The cemetery in Yong'an Cemetery will also be講置 by the society. Regarding the various legal issues after Mr. Yang's death and the procedures for urging the police to arrest the murderers, his brother, Yang Jifu, has asked Wang Yintai, a great lawyer, to生持云.</p>

<h3>French Mail Ship Passengers and Mail Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Wheelock Mactavish Tugboat Carries Large Number of Passengers and Mail)</p>
<p>(Sailed from Putuo Incident Site at Noon Yesterday) Expected to Arrive at Port Late Last Night or This Morning. The French mail ship "Aramis" ran aground off the coast of Putuo, and all passengers were rescued. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. The following is a further report:</p>
<p>) Ship Body Repair (</p>
<p>After the "Aramis" ran aground, the Shanghai company immediately sent Director Mi Huali, engineers Qiu Xin and Ye Song, and diver Bubu to the scene of the accident to inspect the ship's hull in order to carry out temporary repairs. Yesterday, the company received a report that the fourth cargo hold of the "Aramis" had been breached by the reef. The engineers from the two shipyards sent divers into the water to try to flatten the broken bottom of the ship and use the materials they brought to first plug the hole, and then use邦浦 to pump out the accumulated water in the hold. The work was actively carried out yesterday and it is expected that the damaged area can be filled and then towed to the shipyard for major repairs.</p>
<p>(Continued Dispatch of Warships) After the French warship "Argus" stationed in Shanghai sailed to the Putuo waters on the morning of the 23rd to protect the shipwrecked mail ship, the Shanghai French Navy authorities dispatched another warship "Tuoli Mogersai" to Steepple Island at 5:40 pm that afternoon, because the French ship had 40 boxes of械子弹 allocated by the French government to the Shanghai French Navy, which the French warship went to駁載 in order to be transported to Shanghai for unloading. (Passengers Arrive in Shanghai) There were a total of 101 passengers on the French mail ship, of whom a minority came from France and the majority came from Hong Kong, mostly Chinese. A large Wheelock Mactavish tugboat dispatched by the Shanghai company to pick up passengers arrived in the Putuo waters at 9:30 pm on the 23rd.</p>
<p>It was not until yesterday morning that all the passengers were successively遇登 on the passenger barge from the French mail ship, and the mail sent by the French post was also unloaded to the ship and sent to Shanghai first. At 12:30 pm, the passenger ship began to set anchor and sail from the Putuo waters, going straight to Shanghai. Director Mi Huali of the French company and the engineers from the two shipyards also took the ship back to Shanghai first. However, because it is far from Shanghai, and the speed of the small ship is slow, it had not yet passed Wusong as of 7:30 pm. According to the company's message, the small ship carrying passengers to Shanghai is expected to arrive in Shanghai tonight and land at the new customs terminal. However, as of 9:00 pm, there was no accurate report of the arrival time in Shanghai, and it is feared that it will arrive late at night and land this morning.</p>
<p>(French Warship Escort) At about 7:00 pm yesterday afternoon, the French company received a telegram from the warship stating that the passenger barge was escorted by a French warship at the same time to Shanghai, and another warship remained in the Putuo waters to protect the French mail ship to prevent accidents. The company has sent staff to stay at the company for the past two days to work overnight, as they need to wait for news, and 接客 who enquire about the news from all sides cannot meet the needs.</p>
<p>(Mail Ship Not Arrived) The "Aramis" ship has a deadweight of 24,000 tons, and the fourth hold that ran aground this time was carefully constructed and isolated from other holds, so it has no impact on the entire ship. However, the shipyards in Shanghai do not have a large dry dock of 800 or 900 feet, so it is difficult for the ship to be repaired in Shanghai. According to the company's message last night, the "Aramis" has not left the Putuo waters and there is no news of its arrival in Shanghai. According to reliable news, after the hole is plugged, it may go to the Mitsubishi Shipyard in Nagasaki for major repairs. The cargo on the ship that has not been驳卸 will be出卸 after the repairs are completed.</p>
<p>) Delay Ship Schedule (The ship is a formal ship on the Sino-French route and has a fixed schedule, which must not be delayed under normal circumstances. At 6:00 pm yesterday afternoon, people who were greeting passengers went to the Customs Wharf to wait for the passenger ship, but they knew that there was no confirmed arrival time, and they dispersed at 9:00 pm. If the "Aramis" ship is to export on July 1 as originally scheduled, it will be impossible, but passengers who have already reported the湖丝 and other goods that must be shipped out on that day went to the company to inquire about the ship schedule, and passengers who have booked cabins also asked about the departure date. According to the company's estimate, the fastest delay will be one week before the repairs can be completed and the ship can depart. All losses have not yet been clarified.</p>

<h3>Students Driving Bicycles Carelessly Cause Many Troubles</h3>
<p>) Hitting Pedestrians and Arguing with Each Other (</p>
<p>(Police and Thugs Join in the Beating)</p>
<p>丨In the Chaos, Bandits Commit Robbery丨</p>
<p>At about 7:00 pm the night before last, students from the Datong College at the back gate of the South Railway Station were riding bicycles on the Station Road. Because they lacked driving skills, they accidentally knocked down a pedestrian. They grabbed each other and clashed. Unexpectedly, the police officer from the Second District Police Station came to inquire, which led to an argument. The police officer used a baton to beat the students. Soon, three 落差 police officers also joined in the beating. At the time, three or four thugs who were eating tea on the tiger stove also took advantage of the熱逞兇 beating. Later, the students were injured, and the boarding students in the college knew about it. The crowd flocked to the police station to question the police, causing a great disturbance. The patrol leader Zhang of the police station apologized and escorted the four police officers to the Public Security Bureau for disposal. The case was then temporarily suspended, but the college still needs to negotiate. In this chaos, three bandits took the opportunity to break into a large rice shop on Station Road, threatening with guns and robbing more than 200 yuan. When the police station was notified and the police rushed to the scene, the bandits had already disappeared like the Yellow Crane.</p>
<h3>Teahouse on Yalu Road Collapses and Injures People</h3>
<p>(A Total of Eight Men and Women Injured)</p>
<p>Yongxing Teahouse, located at Nos. 89 and 90, Nanpu, at the Southern end of the Qiakazi Bridge on Yalu Road, has been open for more than ten years. The Shen Taichang Tobacco and Paper Shop is located downstairs. However, the house has been in disrepair for years, so although the exterior still looks semi-new, the interior is actually dilapidated. At around 5:00 pm yesterday afternoon, when the teahouse was bustling with customers, there was a sudden creaking sound on the roof of the building, and at the same time, the桑木 was seen shaking and about to fall. The customers rushed out, but at that moment, the roof of the building collapsed completely, causing all the customers in the back who did not have time to escape to be crushed and injured. The nearby岗捕 saw it and quickly reported it to the police station. The探捕 and ambulance were sent to the scene to drag the injured one by one from the rubble and send them to the Tongren Hospital for diagnosis.

<h3>Yesterday's Mediation of the Collection of Fishery Construction Fees May Lead to a Resolution</h3>
<p>Hoping for a Temporary Suspension of Collection Before Resolution, and a Proposal to Appropriately Reduce Collection Fees. Due to the collection of construction fees, disputes have arisen with the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association. Mediation has been ineffective for over a month, with no concrete solution. After Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo came to Shanghai a few days ago to attend the second meeting of the Fishery Improvement Association, he specially instructed Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting to mediate again, considering the plight of fishermen and merchants. It is learned that the mediators summoned representatives of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation, Meng Lujiu, Mao Anqing, and Hu Diansun, at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2 PM to discuss everything. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Attendees) Mediators of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association: Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting; Representatives of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation: Meng Lujiu, Mao Anqing, Hu Diansun; Observers: Zhang Shenzhi; Representatives of the Seafood Industry: Zhou Liangui, Wu Zongxing; Representatives of the Fish Market: Wang Baokang, Wu Xintai, Xu Puxing; Representative of the Ningbo Ice Fresh Goods Industry: Le Qidong.</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) After Chairman Yu Qiaqing presided, and Lin Zitong recorded, the chairman reported briefly, saying that the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association had disputes over the collection of fishery construction fees. Fishery trade associations in Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Dinghai Shipu, Shaoxing, and other places had formed the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation, issued a declaration, and requested assistance. They summoned the fish merchants for mediation once, but no agreement was reached. This time, after Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo attended the second meeting of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Improvement Association, he again instructed him, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting to mediate twice. Therefore, he convened everyone today to discuss, hoping that on the one hand, they could alleviate the suffering of the fishermen, and on the other hand, urge the government to implement various constructions in the fishery industry. Everyone should speak with their conscience and negotiate fairly. If there are any opinions, feel free to express them as much as possible for reference, etc.</p>
<p>(Representatives' Opinions) Hangzhou representative Meng Lujiu reported briefly, saying that the principle of the Ministry of Industry collecting construction fees is to take from the fishery and use for the fishery. All collection fees are collected by the fish market, but this claim is contrary to the principle. The fish caught by fishermen in the ocean are sold to ice-fresh boat customers, who sell them to the interior and entrust them to the market for sale. The market deducts the construction fee, which is taken from the fish market, not from the fishermen. This is inconsistent with the law. In addition, regardless of whether the fish is 20 or 30 catties, it is transported from Hangzhou and has already paid the fee. Later, it is sold directly to various places in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The car and the month are forced by Wu to order the transportation company and the transit market to collect the fee regardless of what it is. For example, imported goods that have already completed customs duties must also be collected again and again. In addition, the capital amount and the size of business are investigated from the salty and fresh fish markets. Fish merchants and fishermen are suffering and it is difficult to bear. It should be requested to correct the collection method from the Ministry to avoid harassment, and please preside over it, etc. Then, Ningbo representative Mao Anqing reported briefly, saying: 1. Ningbo merchants lend money to the boat owners, that is, they lend it to the fresh water customers. The customers collect goods from the fishermen and sell them to the salted goods market. There is absolutely no direct contact with overseas fishermen. If the ice fresh goods customers are in arrears with the principal every year, if they collect construction fees on behalf of them, the losses will be even greater, and they will inevitably go bankrupt. 2. Ningbo has never had ocean protection fees. The ice fresh goods imported to Ningbo are all small boats and there are no protection boats, so it is difficult to collect fees on behalf of them. 3. All the shellfish from the outer sea and the inner river are also recorded in the fish market records, and the scattered harvests are used as a whole to collect fees, so there are more disputes. Please ask the mediators to find fair ways to provide relief. Next, Shanghai representative Hu Diansun reported briefly, saying that the Shanghai market has always been a place where ice fresh fish merchants entrust their goods to the market for sale, and there is no direct transaction with fishermen. If the market is instructed to collect fees on behalf of them, is it in conflict with the law? Since the principle is to take from the fishery and use it for the fishery, it seems that the fees should be collected directly from the fishermen. The Shanghai market has never lent money, so it is difficult to collect fees on behalf of them. Please also preside over justice, etc.</p>
<p>(Safeguarding Construction Fees) After the representatives reported, the chairman repeatedly explained and relieved the suffering of the fishermen as the only principle, so both parties understood each other's opinions. However, the representatives always used various harassment from the collection office as an excuse and also requested a reduction in the collection fees. As for how to handle the fees collected in the future, it should also be considered. The chairman replied that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo expressed this time that the collection of construction fees would not be used by the various bureaus of the ministry. It has been decided that Lin Kanghou, secretary-general of the Banking Association, will be responsible for safeguarding the construction fees, because Mr. Lin is also a member of the Fishery Improvement Association. In the future, fishery construction must be approved by all members, and various trade associations can also make suggestions to the authorities for selection, such as adding patrol ships to protect maritime safety, setting up maritime radio stations to communicate news, and purchasing weather stations to measure climate. This is especially urgent.</p>
<p>) Discussion Results (The mediators Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Zuoting discussed with the representatives. According to the New News Agency reporter's record, the following was determined: 1. The mediators will submit all kinds of fishermen's suffering and the harshness of the collection personnel to the Ministry of Industry for review. 2. Before this case is resolved, it is hoped that the Ministry of Industry will temporarily postpone the collection of fees. 3. It is proposed to suggest a reduction in the collection fees to alleviate the suffering of the people. 4. Pirates are rampant when fishermen are fishing. Please ask the government to send patrol ships to strictly patrol and consolidate coastal defense. 5. Zhenhai and Dinghai in Ningbo have never had ocean protection offices. Ocean Protection Committees should be organized to handle ocean protection affairs. 6. It is suggested that the government reduce the scope of various bureaus to save expenses.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Electric Tramway Significantly Repairs Tracks</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Electric Tramway Company operates tramways on various roads to facilitate public transportation. In order to improve the tracks on various roads and seek long-term benefits, the company is reorganizing and reconstructing the cement and steel frame foundations. It has ordered heavy steel rails from various German factories, and has sent workers to reconstruct them separately. The section of the Southbound Route 1 from the Bund Guanqiao to Dongjiadu has been completed and opened to traffic. It feels very solid. The car is running smoothly, and a section of the northbound route is continuing to work. The connection between the old Ximen and Fangbang Bridge, the connection between Heping Road and Guohuo Road, the connection between the Shanghai Army Camp and Bansongyuan Road, and the connection between the station and the rear road must all be built in the same way. It is expected that once the above projects are completed, all the cement and steel frame foundations on the tracks of the Republic Road and Zhonghua Road that have not been rebuilt will be rebuilt one by one. It is heard that the former project costs as much as 800,000 yuan. Once completed, it will not only be convenient for passengers, but also add a lot of glory to the appearance of the road.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's Determination to Suppress Prostitution</h3>
<p>丨Future Efforts Should Take a Further Step丨The Chinese Child Welfare Association has previously reported and investigated, confirming that in recent years, a group of underage girls have been found playing on the streets, in playgrounds, and in hotels and restaurants. Although the methods are different, the purpose of prostitution is the same. Moreover, after investigating their backgrounds, most of them were abducted, sold, and oppressed. Both humanitarianism and the law do not allow it. Recently, it has become particularly rampant.</p>
<p>We must find a way to provide relief. A month ago, the association separately sent letters to the administrative authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession to strictly suppress it. It has been reported in the newspapers. It is now heard that the association has received a reply from the Public Concession Municipal Council. Excerpts are as follows: We respectfully reply to your association's work, which has always been admired. It is especially appreciated that you are concerned about and denounce this kind of social crime, which is a great help to our administrative work. The future is worth celebrating. Our bureau has also been very concerned about the existence of this kind of crime and has used various effective measures to fight it. For example, the police department arrested 1,167 prostitutes operating on the streets or in brothels in the Lao Zha area last year, 30 of whom were sent to the Jiliang Institute for education. This year, as of May 22, 1,138 people have been arrested in the same area, and 26 have been sent to the Jiliang Institute. Since the police department's efforts, street arrests have decreased. In the future, we will work harder to arrest in hotels and playgrounds, but in this kind of venue, it is more difficult to handle. Please give your association more encouragement.</p>

<h3>Dongxinqiao Street Murder Case Awaits Sentencing</h3>
<p>Chen Zhikui, the young owner of Qianfengtai Incense Shop in Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, 29 years old this year, returned to the store from outside at 9 pm on April 14 this year, and then went out and detoured to the small alley next to the north of the store, and climbed the stairs from the back door to go home. While walking in the alley, he was suddenly shot and seriously injured by a thug.</p>
<p>The key point was death. At the same time, Chen Qiancheng, the accountant of the store, heard the sound and went out, also being shot and wounded to the ground. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment. At that time, the murderer escaped without a trace. On the 13th of last month, at 8 am, Jin Jiulin, a superintendent of the special agency of the French Patrol Room, arrested Zhu Quanxing, a Wuxi native, the murderer, at No. 40, Shuangguili, Du Shenfu Road, and recovered two pistols and seven bullets. He was sent to the Second Special District Local Court, where the patrol room lawyer filed a public prosecution according to law. According to Zhu's confession, he and the fleeing little monk went to the Qianfengtai Incense Shop upstairs to borrow two pistols from Wang Yutang to prepare to fight with Xiao Fugeng. He stumbled and fell when he went downstairs, and the pistol went off, etc. He also hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend him. The circumstances have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiong Huicui continued the trial in the criminal court. The judge first questioned the defendant and Chen Zheng, the mother of the victim. Chen Zheng also hired lawyer Huang Yiyan to act as an agent and requested an incidental private prosecution to recover the victim's losses and childcare expenses from Zhu Quanxing and Wang Liutang, totaling 3,500 yuan. The judge said to Chen Zheng that Wang Yutang is now on the run and has not been arrested, and the patrol room is not prosecuting Wang. It is illegal to add a private prosecution to Wang. Chen's lawyer withdrew the private prosecution against Wang and asked Zhu to pay. Zhu confessed that he was poor and could not afford to pay. The court then ordered the debate to begin. First, patrol room lawyer Fei Xizhen argued that after the defendant's arrest, he pointed out the location of the death of Chen Zhikui and the injury of Chen Qiancheng, and two pistols were recovered, and the three bullet casings found by the patrol room at the scene of the incident were verified to have been fired from these two guns. The defendant committed the crime of ordinary murder.</p>
<p>The patrol room prosecuted according to Article 285, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Code and requested that the defendant be sentenced according to law</p>
<p>After that, the defendant's lawyer, Zhu, argued that although the defendant committed the crime of murder, he confessed in court that it was a pistol that went off. According to the previous precedent of the Supreme Court, the explanation for murder and injury resulting in death is extremely</p>
<p>Ming The defendant in this case did not intentionally kill, but only caused the disaster due to a misfire, and could only constitute the crime of injury causing death, requesting the court to make a lenient judgment. Finally, the lawyer representing the plaintiff debated the private prosecution part, and the court ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 28th. The defendant was still detained for instructions</p>
<h3>Shao Wansheng's Debt Entanglements</h3>
<p>(The guarantor appealed against the original judgment)</p>
<p>When the old and new owners of Shao Wansheng South-North Goods Shop took over last year, the old owner owed</p>
<p>more than 100,000 debts. Zhang Boming, a Confucian doctor from Ningbo, represented the old owner and negotiated the repayment method with the creditors. As a result, most of them were settled at a discount. Only Gong Fanglai, the manager of Yuelai South-North Goods Shop, and his Hengxin Company had a mortgage claim of 1,500 taels and refused to lose a single bit. Because the mortgage document was written by Zhang Boming on behalf of the debtor, and Zhang also held the position of guarantor, Hengxin Company hired lawyer Chen Tingrui and sued Zhang Boming in the First Special District Local Court. Zhang failed to appear at the repeated hearings and was sentenced in absentia, ordering Zhang to repay the full amount and bear interest and litigation fees. Zhang was unwilling to accept the judgment and immediately hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, presiding judge San met with judges Ye and Ni to try the lawyer for the appellant, saying that the mortgaged property of this loan was a piece of land of 6,000 or 7,000 yuan. Although the land is far away in Ningbo, the creditor can first pursue the main debtor and ask him to compensate. If the main debtor ignores him, he can still request the disposal of the mortgaged property. Why did he immediately sue the guarantor for compensation? The original trial court's approval of his request was unacceptable</p>
<p>Therefore, the appeal was made. The appellee, Hengxin Company, was still represented by lawyer Chen Tingrui and presented the mortgage document, saying that it was stated in the document that if the loan was not paid by the due date, the guarantor would be responsible. Therefore, it was not wrong to sue Zhang according to the contract. The court then declared the debate over and awaited the scheduled sentencing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dianchen Convicted of Premeditated Murder</h3>

After the crime, the murderers fled without a trace. On May 13, Jin Jiulin, a superintendent of the special agency of the French Patrol Room, and Detective Zhang Ziying, etc., learned that the murderers were hiding in the Oriental Hotel on Sanmalu and immediately rushed to arrest Zhang Dianchen and sent him to the Second Special District Local Court, where the patrol room lawyer filed a public prosecution according to Article 282 of the Criminal Code for premeditated murder. Judge Xiong Huicui repeatedly heard the trial, and Zhang confessed to shooting. The court appointed lawyer Shan Yuhua to defend the defendant. After the trial was concluded, a verdict was made and a date was set for sentencing. The circumstances have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, when the sentencing date arrived, the patrol room escorted Zhang to the court, where Judge Xiong presided over the first criminal court and sentenced Zhang Dianchen to life imprisonment for premeditated murder and deprived him of his civil rights for life. The defendant was detained in the jail during the appeal period.</p>

The Municipal Council has ordered the Paris Grand Theater to stop showing it due to the opposition of the Russians in this port, and the Great Light Theater has temporarily postponed the showing after receiving the order.

According to the person in charge of the company, the film purely uses artistic techniques to depict the life of pre-revolutionary Soviet Russia and has no anti-propaganda effect. There are no conditions for a ban.</p>

<p>Respected Sir:</p>
<p>Forgive my ignorance. I know that amidst the widespread panic and the general social malaise, individual and localized problems cannot be satisfactorily resolved. Moreover, I have read your replies to many readers, including advice such as, "…hope to think big, fight for the group, and a way out will naturally emerge…" However, respected sir, please don't mind the trouble and give me a more concrete answer. I am a lonely and pitifully ignorant child!</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience in answering, please forgive my boldness in introducing myself. I hope it doesn't annoy you. I am a poor youth from a small town of 400,000 people in western Zhejiang. Apart from being born in the glorious year of the founding of the Republic of China, I have been living in miserable circumstances since childhood. In particular, the so-called illustrious families, with generations of scholars, are still struggling in the "waning" era, making their lives even more unbearable than those of homeless vagrants who have nothing at all. But, amidst this harsh and impoverished life, I was able to graduate from two elementary schools and one middle school through working part-time and studying. Because of this, I received the enthusiastic support of my teachers, who paid all my fees and gave me some awards, bringing comfort to my parents who toiled like beasts of burden. Afterwards, I found a job at a silk weaving factory in Huzhou as an apprentice. I studied textile design and earned a monthly wage of four small silver dollars. At the same time, I wrote articles for literary publications or did writing and drawing for the general public. With some slight improvement in my situation, I also obtained permission from the factory manager to set aside three hours a day for self-study. This went on for three whole years. In the last year, I also accepted special assignments as a contributor for the Youth Morning Post and other newspapers. At the same time, I also served as the secretary of the militia. That year, I also experienced the life of a news editor at a newspaper. During the day, I was a worker, and at night, I edited and pasted articles. In the early morning, I went to perform official duties. I only had four hours of sleep each day. As a result, I lost my factory job, which I had held for three years. Fortunately, I had a few dollars saved, which did not affect my family. As for me, a lonely child, I had been selling my childhood and could no longer endure being exploited by society in this way. I am so fragile, yet the fire in my heart has already been ignited, and the blood of resistance is boiling. This is revolutionary sentiment and political awareness! Ah! Will I always be so fragile, a fragile child? Will I forever groan in the jaws of the devil? No! No! In the spring of 1930, I was admitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Military Academy. Until the summer of 1931, I was assigned to Kaihua on the border of Zhejiang. There, at the Haoling Baisha Pass, I began the first page of my career as a military officer. Although there were all sorts of practical troubles, they could not stop my ideal future. Afterwards, I was ordered to suppress bandits in the mountains of Huaiyu in Jiangxi. I was able to lead my entire unit in and out of the battlefield, which earned me the rank of second lieutenant and then lieutenant. Later, I was transferred to Changshan and Jiangshan. After trekking across the snow-covered and foggy Xianxia Ridge and setting off for Xianyang and Pucheng in Fujian, and Guangfeng in Jiangxi, I was already a full captain. "Fair-skinned and rosy-cheeked, with deep dimples, looking like a girl! We've never seen such a young officer, a commanding officer!" "The times have really changed! Is this officer perhaps a girl? Sigh! A revolutionary soldier!" "You don't know, our platoon leader really has character! Doesn't smoke, doesn't gamble, doesn't drink, just reads books and writes articles all day long. Hmph! But when it comes to forming a firing line, you wouldn't believe it! He leaps forward like a madman. With an unexpected shout—fix bayonets! Charge! With that sharp command, the bugle sounds, the blades flash, the wind picks up, and we can't help but follow him as he flies forward!" Respected sir, did my life then turn towards a more meaningful and fulfilling direction? No! No! Our Zhejiang provincial army, to put it bluntly, was barely passable; in fact, it was no different from a business organization! Soldiers and city monks were no different. The gun barrels were filled with the wronged souls of the unheard, and the diagonal belts were more filled with filth than a prostitute's menstrual cloth! It is said that soldiers value their lives lightly and cherish loyalty most. In reality, that is too idealistic! It is said that soldiers live a carefree life, but pure youths don't want that kind of carefree life! However, I was, after all, an officer in command of more than a hundred brothers. What was I there for? Of course, I couldn't bear to go along with the crowd and would not do so. I wanted to implement my ideals. The first step was to find out the history of my unit, because I knew that my company had been captured from Fang Zhenwu's side. They were "northerners," and compared to the provincial army made up of southerners, they could be said to be outstanding in terms of military discipline and combat effectiveness. I was determined to make this company something meaningful. So, the second step was to conduct some intelligence tests and psychological tests, creating several memorable forms. The third step was to</p>
<p>begin working on emotional solidarity, improving living conditions, and recognizing social and national ideas. By this point, although only four months had passed, we gradually felt like a family, and the other camps and companies became very uneasy. During the Battle of Shanghai, we intensified our training. One day, I was giving a lecture in a public sports field when suddenly the regiment commander's orderly... "Reporting! The regiment commander requests your presence!" As usual, I walked into the reading room. Suddenly, there was a surge of bayonets at the door, as if to tell me that I was being imprisoned. After a while, I received instructions from the battalion headquarters... "…So-and-so is transferred to so-and-so company, the vacancy is filled by so-and-so. So-and-so is transferred to so-and-so company, so-and-so's resignation is approved…" When did I resign? But, I was not allowed to say anything. Later, the aide-de-camp gave me the news... "Didn't the battalion commander talk to you a few days ago about how the army's rice and clothing are also worn out, and he was thinking of quitting? That's because the regiment commander asked him to ask you to resign voluntarily. Some of them said you had some suspicion, so he reported you for dismissal and investigation. In fact, the regiment commander has always respected you as a young hero and intended to promote you. But you went against the wishes of the majority and said he was outdated. However, he still values you very much. Loves you. He asks you to look at the newspaper, even if it's an investigation and the order only says 'resignation approved,' so that your company can deal with it and point it out. To preserve your past glory…" That day, the regiment commander hosted a farewell dinner for me. At night, the battalion and company commanders all came to contribute money for the drinks. I don't know what kind of show they were putting on. Early the next morning, they changed into plain clothes and quietly sent me to the bus station for the ancient city of Xi'an. In an instant, firecrackers went off in unison, and when the bugle stopped, the soldiers of so-and-so company stood in formation. Their representative brought out an object and reported... "This is really unexpected! Yesterday, a new company commander came. The battalion commander held a 'proclamation ceremony' and announced that our old officer had resigned! Left? Gone! Alas! We don't know what's going on. We don't understand why our officer would leave us for no reason! He and many of the brothers were in tears. We didn't want the officer to leave like this, without any explanation! But we had to obey the orders, and even our platoon leader and squad leader were transferred! Gone! We don't know what it means! Because we haven't caused any trouble, have we! We haven't been paid for five months. The officer even sold his bedding to provide food. How could such an officer resign and abandon us! What should we do? Our officer left today, and we don't know what day we'll be leaving! We want to show our appreciation, so we hastily present these four characters, 'Light Shines Ten Thousand Miles,' just to show a little appreciation, but it doesn't mean much! We don't want the officer to leave like this, we all don't want it! But we can't keep him! When will we hear his command again? Please give us some parting words!" For a long, long time, amidst their tearful, forceful salutes, the bewildered and noisy crowd of common people, the sound of firecrackers and bugles, the regiment's adjutant whispered something to the driver, and—off we went!… This was my departure from the army. This happened last April. Although I was worried about my company, it had already been fragmented. At that time, I had to go home. For two years, because of my studies and military service, I didn't send a single penny home, and we were poorer than ever. My father had lost his job and returned home four years ago, constantly complaining. My old mother sewed clothes, unable to support the family. The family was in a state of turmoil,</p>
<p>arguing all day long. We have over a hundred acres of mulberry land, but it is barren and we have no strength to cultivate it. I tried cultivating it when I returned home, but unfortunately, within a few months, this field would be cultivated, and then that one would sprout again! And without fertilization, there was no sustained strength. Raising silkworms resulted in everyone in the family being exhausted and sick. The only silkworm cocoons we had, no one wanted. I am not afraid of a harsh life, I can endure hard work, complaints, hunger, and cold, and I am used to it from my time in the army. But too much stimulation, too deep, has made me sick! My living standards are not very high, but now, my family of five depends on the rent from more than ten rooms, which totals four dollars a month. Without complaining, it should be said that we are prone to sickness! I have fought many times and witnessed the misery of the people in the war zone. And I am often a reader of your newspaper, so I have gained some insight into the world situation and the current state of the nation. The misery of a single person and a single family is not worth mentioning. I still want to "think big and fight for the group," sacrificing my personal well-being. Last year, so-and-so in so-and-so place organized a National Automatic Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, so I joined it and trained for two months. Although it was disbanded, there were many enthusiastic and patriotic youths in it. Because we didn't want this united force to end there, we established the Juvenile Aspiration Society. We also set up an amateur reading club and a national salvation assassination squad. At that time, Dai Jitao was in Wuxing. In view of his newspaper achievements in the Tianchou era, we thought it was worth visiting him. He greatly supported us in organizing a modern newspaper. Unfortunately, it failed due to economic and registration review issues. Afterwards, because of the increase in our comrades, we planned to expand to the countryside, successively establishing farmer night schools, rural recreation centers, and private primary schools with aspirations. But most of us are poor youths. Everyone poured out all they had, and we were still worried about not being able to continue our studies. Not only did society provide no assistance, but it also indirectly struck us with cold eyes. So-and-so, originally, from the perspective of ordinary people, these young people, sacrificing money and time to do things with no fame or profit, must have other purposes! Alas, we barely managed to support it until January of this year, when we closed the money-losing school. Although the assassination squad's bullets had drawn social attention, it also ended due to economic difficulties, leaving only the lovely</p>
<p>memories of throwing grenades. Ideals are too high, plans too detailed, strength is limited—and without a "strong" and powerful backstage boss, even with the common struggle of many passionate youths, it only makes the pure hearts of the youths suffer another</p>
<p>blow. As for me, gritting my teeth, sacrificing my well-being, I was determined, but I only suffered hardships and became exhausted in body and mind. It can only be said that I gained more experience. Of course, at this point, my pitiful family still opens its scarred and mottled wings to welcome me, a fledged bird returning. But, the family environment is getting worse every day, so how can I bear to burden them for long? Moreover, I actually can't stay long. I feel that the failures in the past were only due to improper methods, not that the youth cannot "struggle for the group." This time, I have decided on my expedition. The goal is: to go to the front line against Japan—at least, I have some combat experience. Taking the train is out of the question because of money. Taking a sea ship also costs more than ten dollars to get to Beiping. Therefore, I decided to walk north. The first time, there were five of us. But we didn't reach our destination. The second time, only I was left halfway. When I got to Zhenjiang, the Public Security Bureau saw me as a madman and escorted me back. The third time, I finally reached Nanjing, but because a friend helped me with ten yuan to return to Shanghai and take a sea ship, I unfortunately didn't even have enough money to buy a ticket. The fourth time, I walked to Pukou. Under the vast Stone City water, without money, I couldn't cross. Although I tried every means, I could only run back to Zhejiang. The fifth time, I bitterly scraped together a few dollars at home, but I fell ill again halfway! My feet hurt so much that I couldn't take a step. And the news came that the natural river had been lost until the truce agreement was established. My beautiful dream of marching north was disillusioned after four months of hardship, abuse, and humiliation. I was kindly sent to Shanghai. At the North Station, I was seen by a military academy classmate who was frustrated in Shanghai. He pawned his overcoat and sent me home.</p>
<p>This happened a week ago. Now, everything is unrecognizable, and the past is unbearable to recall. Wasn't I just blindly following the crowd in the past? What about the future? My expedition was originally a search for a more meaningful suicide. But now, even suicide is asking me to cowardly jump into the water or take other old paths! Respected sir! I hope I haven't bored you with my rambling writing. Forgive my poor writing skills, especially in the midst of a heavy foot ulcer, I can't say it more tactfully or concisely.</p>
<p>Now, I will summarize the following themes and request your reply:</p>
<p>㈠ Is it possible for young people like us, who are naive and shallow, especially without a background or support, who even have difficulty with their own lives but possess a firm will and full of enthusiasm, to think big and strive to work for the group?</p>
<p>㈡ Where should we start working for the group? To create an environment? To join an existing group?</p>
<p>(If joining an existing group, where should we go? How should we go?)</p>
<p>㈢ The spirit of the people is extremely depressed and exhausted. Justice is not upheld, and all verbal calls are useless! What should we do? ㈣ We have many passionate youths in our society who have all aspired to fight for the society, the country, and the masses. They have indeed sacrificed considerable time, effort, money, and reputation. But after several blows from society, they are all exhausted and forgetful. Are they beyond redemption? Don't we need to awaken them to continue their more fierce冲進 (衝進 chōng jìn - to charge, rush in)?</p>
<p>㈤ Obviously, my family is so poor and pitiful, but they can still accommodate me, the "undutiful son" who has returned wounded! They hope that I can continue to struggle. They really hope that I can earn money to save the family in the future. My parents are old. I know that without solving the whole problem, the affairs of a single person and a single family will not have a satisfactory solution. If I am determined to fight for the group, is it acceptable for me to suck the blood and sweat of my old mother at home (she wholeheartedly serves me)? Can I abandon the burden of this pitiful family? Can I abandon my family?</p>
<p>(My family has parents, a sister, and a foster brother.)</p>
<p>㈥ In such an environment, can I still fight for the group?</p>
<p>㈦ My point is that without solving the overall social problem, we still want to be reasonably responsible for our miserable and homeless families. But how should I be responsible? This means that with money, everything is no problem! Is my life all about making money?</p>
<p>㈧ Now, I have reached the end of my rope. Should I give in and commit suicide? Should I hold on to the slightest hope and seek a living? Are working for the group and seeking personal survival in conflict?</p>
<p>㈨ Based on my own shallow experience and poor skills, I am confident that I can handle: copying; secretarial work; elementary school teaching; tutoring; textile design; art design; news editing; proofreading; writing short articles; military science and military training; fortification; and investigation, monographs, descriptions, etc., on military tactics, society, rural life, the life of laborers, the life of women, local customs, and other matters. And I can endure hard work, complaints, and hardships. I don't mind a very low standard of living, as long as I have four hours of self-study time each day. I wonder if there is such a need now? Forgive me for bothering you like this!</p>
<p>㈩ More than three hundred of my military academy classmates are now 90% unemployed. When we meet, we tell each other our feelings of isolation and anger, and most of us are wandering around. Isn't this a hidden danger in society? I don't know why the national government wants to open such military officer and political schools, producing so many military officers and new aristocrats every year. The national government never consults these unemployed officers! I ran into the military academy and saw the arrogant military students, and I couldn't help but feel extremely sad. Respected sir, I have said too much, but perhaps it is not just what I alone want to say. I sincerely want to break my head and ask you to give me a practical answer and a concrete method. At the same time, it is also what I alone want to say. I sincerely want to break my head and ask you to give me a practical answer and a concrete method. Also,</p>
<p>I hope you can especially find a way to get some space to publish it, along with your answer. Because many of our classmates in similar situations are also looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Finally, thank you for not being bothered to read it all. Please take a quiet break. Your thoughts at this moment are enough to make many youths pitifully and cowardly commit suicide, and also enough to make many youths excitedly and cautiously continue to struggle. I believe you will not disappoint us.</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Having read in the local news section of your newspaper on June 23rd that the reporter of the Dagongshe interviewed the chairman and executive committee members of our association regarding the collection of fishery construction fees, and stated that none of the members of that public association (referring to the Jiangzhe Fishery United Association, which has now been renamed the Jiangzhe Fishery Trade Association Resident Joint Office in accordance with the Group Organization Law) have joined this association, which was apparently caused by a small number of fish merchants being used by others, etc. According to this association, Mr. Du Yuesheng, the chairman of this association, has submitted his resignation, and we are currently trying to retain him, but he has not yet resumed his position. Who exactly is the chairman referred to? Furthermore, this association's participation in the former Jiangzhe Fishery United Association was formally approved by a general meeting of all members of this association and a formal letter was sent to participate. All people in the fishery industry are deeply aware of this. The statements made by the reporter of the Dagongshe are completely contrary to the facts, and we are truly afraid of confusing rumors. Therefore, we have specially sent a letter to correct this. Please publish it. With sincere regards, to the editor of the Shenbao, Shanghai Ice and Fresh Fish Trade Association, June 24th.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Discusses Elementary School Textbooks</p>
<h3>Editing Outline for Each Subject</h3>
<p>The Textbook Editing and Review Committee of the Ministry of Education for elementary and middle school textbooks has held its first meeting on the 17th of this month. Yesterday (24th), the second meeting was held. The first meeting was chaired by Zhu Jiahua. In addition to the chairman's report on the Ministry of Education's plan to compile elementary and middle school textbooks and the organization of the Editing and Review Committee, Director Gu reported on the preparation of elementary school textbooks, and the chief editors of each subject reported on the main points of the editing outline and the editing process. The members also put forward opinions on the editing outline of each subject: ㈠ For the Chinese language subject, the editorial work must take into account both writing aspects. The units in each grade should have a consistent center. The selection of materials should choose things that are commonly seen in children's daily lives, etc. ㈢ For the arithmetic subject, if the materials are particularly suitable for rural areas, special emphasis should be placed on practice. In the past, editing focused on teaching methods, often taking materials from daily life but neglecting the academic subject itself, which also had drawbacks. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the basic practice of certain algorithms, etc. ㈢ For the social studies subject, the amount of history and geography should be increased during this period of national construction. The teaching materials should be based on historical facts. Historical representatives should focus on the history of inventors and not emphasize political figures. Materials on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation should be mostly moved to the first and second grades. History and geography teaching materials can be increased in the third and fourth grades, etc. ㈣ For the natural science subject, food, clothing, shelter, etc. should be linked to social teaching materials in the third year. The content of the teaching materials for this subject should be as concrete as possible so that children can observe and experiment themselves, etc.</p>

The letter requests the Department of Health to send eleven midwives from the Beiping First Midwifery School to Gansu to serve as principals to start the school.</p>

<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Joint Entrance Examination continued yesterday, and most of the examinations have been completed. Thirty-one schools continued the examination, and twenty-two schools did not. Director Pan of the Education Bureau Painstakingly Elaborates on the Details.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Graduation Joint Entrance Examination was originally scheduled to be held for three days starting on the 15th of this month.</p>

It is expected that the examination will be completed and concluded. However, a small number of schools did not participate in the continued examination yesterday, and the situation is extremely complicated. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specifically visited Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau to inquire about the details. He was granted an audience and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Director Pan said that the Bureau was ordered by the Ministry of Education to hold joint entrance examinations for primary and secondary schools. The primary school part has been completely completed. The secondary school part was not completed due to the disturbance of leaked questions in the first and third high school examination halls on the 17th of this month. In addition to the leaking of questions being investigated by the Bureau, which has already found clues and sent them to the judicial authorities for strict interrogation and prosecution, the Joint Entrance Examination Committee also presented to the Ministry of Education to set today (the 24th) for the continuation of the examination.

The remaining 53 schools, with one subject for junior middle school and one or three subjects for high school, had not completed the examination, totaling more than 2,000 students. Thirty-one schools, including the Affiliated Middle School of Shanghai University, the Affiliated Middle School of Chih Chih, Nanyang Model Middle School, the Junior Middle School Department of Fudan Experimental Middle School, Jingye Middle School, Wuben Girls' Middle School, Youth Middle School, and Zhengfeng Middle School, totaling more than 1,200 students, participated in the make-up examination today in compliance with the order. In total, approximately more than 1,800 high and junior middle school students participated in the joint entrance examination and completed it.</p>
<h3>Exceeding Half</h3>
<p>There are still 22 schools that did not participate in the continuation of the examination today. The reasons for the failure to participate in the continuation of the examination in these 22 schools are unfortunately complex. According to the reports from the examination supervisors to the Bureau, the students of Minli Middle School, Biwen Girls' Middle School, the High School Department of Fudan Experimental Middle School, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, and the Evening School were all prepared to enter the examination hall to take the examination. However, they were surrounded and intimidated by the student disciplinary teams of other schools, resulting in</p>
<p>[being unable to take the examination].</p>
<p>Moreover, the students of Minli Middle School spontaneously gathered on the spot and signed their names to request a make-up examination, totaling more than 40 people. Due to the disruption of a small number of students, they were unable to take the examination. In other cases, such as the Affiliated Middle School of Guanghua and McTyeire School, the school authorities had taken a vacation early, allowing students to leave the school, so the students also had no way to take the examination. Furthermore, in the case of the Affiliated Middle School of Fudan, the school held a graduation ceremony, and the students could not participate in the continuation of the examination at the same time. Some students were hinted at by teachers, and some held a wait-and-see attitude. Only a very small number of students deliberately disrupted and did not participate in the continuation of the examination. However,</p>
<h3>Most Regrettable</h3>
<p>It is heard that the school authorities of several university-affiliated middle schools declared to the students that if they did not participate in the joint entrance examination, the graduation certificate could be used to directly enter the university if they could not enter other schools. The students did not</p>
<p>know that the Ministry of Education might not recognize this qualification for admission in the future, so they all blindly followed. Even if a small number of students knew about this situation, the school authorities comforted the students by saying that they could negotiate with the Ministry of Education afterwards. Under these circumstances, the students naturally enjoyed avoiding the examination. We should know that students participating in the graduation joint entrance examination is a matter that concerns each student personally and cannot be misused due to the coercion of others. This point is deeply hoped that students,</p>
<h3>Parents Pay Attention</h3>
<p>As for the students, I can understand them quite well and deeply know the difficulties they are in: 1. They were temporarily indignant and suspicious of the Bureau's failure to thoroughly investigate the leaking of examination questions. 2. They were forced by the environment and induced in various ways. I had already anticipated that not all of them would participate in the continuation of the examination today, and I can only listen to it. However, the Bureau will</p>
<h3>Deliberate on Measures</h3>
<p>Ask the Ministry of Education for instructions on how to deal with the students who did not participate in the continuation of the examination this time, based on the circumstances. Those students who deliberately disrupted and gathered crowds to coerce other students not to participate in the examination will naturally be dealt with separately. Those who voluntarily request a make-up examination may still be given the opportunity to take a make-up examination. The examination papers of the students who have already taken the examination will be graded within a few days and announced on a regular basis, it is said.</p>
<h3>Leaking of Examination Questions Found Clues</h3>
<p>Regarding the thorough investigation of the leaking of examination questions for a part of high</p>
<p>schools in this city's joint entrance examination, it is heard that the Bureau has already found clues a few days ago. In addition to a certain number of students and an official of Jianguo Middle School who had obtained the examination questions in advance being taken to the court for interrogation, Director Pan believes that the officials of the Bureau in charge of supervising the printing and binding of the examination questions also have a responsibility to investigate. Therefore, six people were sent to the Chief Prosecutor of the District Court yesterday for strict investigation. It is said that their names are not convenient to be announced during the court investigation process in order to avoid hindering the progress, it is said.</p>
<h3>Career Guidance Movement Week Closing Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Women's Learning Day and the last day of the Career Guidance Movement Week held by the Shanghai Career Guidance Institute of the China Vocational Education Society. The weather was clear, so there were more guests than the previous two days. In total, approximately 700 guests came in the morning and afternoon. In the afternoon, the Guangming Thermos Company distributed paper fans to the attendees. The details of the morning and afternoon events are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning began at 9:00 AM with a speech. The meeting was hosted by Pan Yangqiu, followed by speeches by female vocational education experts Yin Shijun of McTyeire School and Lu Guiliang. In the afternoon, the meeting was chaired by a person whose name is missing, and speeches were given by Huang Shao of Bowen Girls' School and Xu Yuanpu, director of the teacher training department of Wuben Girls' School.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Ms. Bu's speech: "We who are engaged in vocational education must guide women to meet the needs of society and enable women to freely</p>
<p>choose occupations that are similar to their own personalities to serve society. Subjects such as clerical work, councillors, shorthand, Sangmei folding machine embroidery, and continuous sewing are all occupations that are suitable for women and meet the needs of society. I hope that every woman will have a firm purpose when receiving education at a school and strive to find her own way out, work hard to create a self-reliant person," and so on.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Ms. Lu's speech: "The general situation of McTyeire School is that although students' families have differences in wealth and poverty, their clothing, food, and daily life can all promote practicality." She then spoke about the habits of most young people, who value appearance but cannot do practical work. Although women's shortcomings are</p>
<p>different from those of men, they are more prone to giving up and getting angry, so they must cultivate their skills. She also cited the four words of diligence, joy, love, and faith as the guidelines for young men and women to study and live their lives, and none of them can be missing, so that they can enjoy the joy of life," and so on.</p>
<p>Ms. Huang's speech was titled "The Ideal Standard for Women's Education." She said, "(1) The principle of education: 1. The difference between humans and beasts; (2) The method of education: 1. Must adapt to the environment; 2. Must improve the environment; (3) Women's</p>
<p>outlook on life: 1. The traditional roles of being a woman, a wife, and a mother, which can be divided into directly benefiting society and indirectly participating in politics; 2. The unconventional roles of dedicating oneself to society or participating in politics; (4) Women in the transitional era are responsible for household affairs on the one hand and serve society due to difficult family finances on the other hand; (5) The standards for women's education can be divided into three aspects: 1. Consider your own personality, consider the environment, choose a career, cherish time, and improve your habits. By enriching your intelligence in this way, you will not envy vanity and obliterate true beauty. 2. The key points of reading are to have self-confidence, self-reflection, a sense of propriety, and a sense of responsibility. By strengthening your morality, you will not fail to be dedicated to your work and enjoy being in a group. 3. Living in an orderly manner and exercising appropriately can make your body healthy. In summary, if women can all follow this standard for education, then the family will be peaceful, society will be stable, the country will be prosperous, and the world will be unified. This is the welfare after the evolution of women's learning and the way to enjoy life," and so on.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Ms. Xu's speech: "(1) Economic problems: Under this system of private property, and at the same time being oppressed by the world economy in a backward Chinese society, only the children of the middle class have the opportunity to receive secondary education, and this opportunity is taken up by men with</p>
<p>priority, so this is the difficulty that hinders women from going to school. (2) Marriage problems: Women often face marriage problems in the middle of their studies due to environmental and</p>
<p>family relationships, and then women sacrifice themselves for the family after marriage, and their future is ruined, so this is the second difficulty that hinders women from going to school. (3) Health problems: As women's age gradually increases, their physical strength gradually decreases, so most women above high school</p>
<p>have less academic ability than men. This is another physical obstacle to women's education. (4) The disparity between the number of men's and women's schools, and the addition of many proportions." The two ladies' speeches were pertinent, and the male and female students and the audience were deeply moved. The Career Guidance Movement, which had been coming for four days, also came to an end as the sun set and the skirts and shoes mingled.</p>

<h3>News of the Pudong Middle School Disturbance</h3>
<p>A letter from Pudong Middle School reads: "Regarding the two news items about our school published in the Education News column of your newspaper on June 23rd and 24th, after reading them, we found that they do not conform to the facts. Since last year, when the board of directors hired Principal Wu to take office, he has been actively working to improve the level and strictly enforce discipline. As for the school's finances, they have always been audited by accountants by the board of directors, and the curriculum and equipment are all handled in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Recently, due to a small number of students opposing the examination, there was a slight deviation from the rules. In addition to submitting it to the</p>
<p>board of directors and the Education Bureau for joint investigation and handling, all school affairs are still</p>
<p>the responsibility of the principal, and classes continue to be held to participate in the joint entrance examination. Because the summer vacation examination has been completed, the majority of students have already returned to their hometowns. School affairs are handled by the staff separately, and the board of directors and the Education Bureau jointly investigate and handle the various facilities of Principal Wu in the following year.</p>
<p>We are eagerly waiting to discuss and plan with the board of directors. Japan is currently in Shanghai, busy designing and</p>
<p>planning. The news in your newspaper that the school's负责人是 [zhíwèi] is无人, and school affairs are almost invisibly suspended is a rumor and untrue. We are deeply afraid that the contributor of this news has other intentions, so we are sending this special letter to request a correction, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<p>The second day of the China-Philippines Ball Performance</p>
<h3>Qiu Feihai Wins Again Against Bao Lindan</h3>
<p>Lin Baohua Loses to Qie Weiya in Singles; Lin Qiu Wins in Doubles Exhibition; Qiu Feihai Plays Again Against Qie Weiya</p>
<p>Yesterday at the French Chamber of Commerce, the second day of the Sino-Philippine tennis exhibition featured two singles matches and one doubles match. Qiu Feihai's victory over Bao Lindan was effortless. Lin Baohua played against Qie Weiya, and although Lin could have won, he failed and lost 1-2. The doubles exhibition was outstanding, with Lin and Qiu defeating the Philippine players 2-1. The audience yesterday was even larger than the day before, with seven or eight hundred nobles and ladies in attendance. Today, the event will be held at the French Chamber of Commerce, hosted by the Lawn Tennis Club, starting at 3:00 PM. The results from yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>(China) Qiu Feihai 6-2, 6-3 Bao Lindan (Philippines)</p>
<p>(Philippines) Qie Weiya 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 Lin Baohua (China)</p>
<p>(China) Qiu Feihai 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 Qie Weiya Bao Lindan (Philippines)</p>
<p>In the first set, the match started at 3:00 PM. Qiu Feihai's serve failed, and Bao Lindan won the first game. Then, the score was tied. Bao Lindan then took the lead again with a score of 2-1. However, Bao Lindan's shots became weak, and Qiu Feihai's fierce attacks made it impossible for him to defend. Qiu then won 6-2. In the second set, Qiu Feihai took the lead at the beginning and was invincible. His deep baseline shots attacked both sides, tiring Bao Lindan. Qiu took the lead with two games. Bao Lindan calmly fought back and won a game, making it 4-1, then 4-2, and then 5-3. After that, Qiu won another game to end the set.</p>
<h3>Qie Weiya Defeats Lin Baohua</h3>
<p>The first set of the second match was between Lin Baohua and Qie Weiya. At that time, the sun was blazing, making the heat unbearable. The competition between the two was particularly difficult. Lin served first and lost. In the next three games, Lin's sharp and rapid shots and volleys proved effective. Qie Weiya was unable to defend and lost three games. It was thought that Lin Baohua had a great chance of winning. In the next game, Lin's serve failed again, making it 3-2. Qie Weiya served, and Lin took the lead, but after several ties, in the second set, Lin gained the upper hand in every point, using his slice serve to win completely. Qie Weiya also responded with cannon-like serves, winning four consecutive points. Then, each player added another game. In a relatively uneventful situation, Lin won 4-2. Qie Weiya added one game, but lost the eighth game with a slice serve. Lin then won the set 6-3.</p>
<p>In the third set, after two sets, the players' heads were hot and they were exhausted. So, they each went to the shade to cool down their heads with cold water to refresh themselves. However, Lin Baohua was even more exhausted. Every time he went to the net, the opponent used high balls to attack his back, and Lin was too tired to return the shots. Qie Weiya was able to take a 4-1 lead. When Lin saw Qie Weiya going to the net, he looked panicked. As a result, his mind and hands could not coordinate, and many shots were missed. As a result, Qie Weiya won again 6-3.</p>
<h3>Lin and Qiu Win in Doubles</h3>
<p>The first set of singles having ended, the doubles match immediately followed. Qiu and Lin can be said to be a perfect match, adding to the splendor of the event. The two sides competed, sometimes engaging in close combat and sometimes launching long-range attacks, vying for surprising victories and demonstrating great skill. However, Lin Baohua's energy had not yet recovered, and he inevitably made some minor mistakes. As a result of the first game, Lin and Qiu won 6-4.</p>
<p>In the second set, the Philippine players used high-pressure attacks, making it difficult for Lin and Qiu to cope. However, the opponent's focus was on Lin, preventing Lin and Qiu from coordinating. As a result, the Philippine players won 6-3.</p>
<p>In the third set, after a short rest, the match continued. At this time, the evening sun was reflected, the summer heat had subsided, and the evening breeze was gentle. The spirit was revitalized, and Lin Baohua washed away his dejected state, looking radiant and energetic. Whether it was high-pressure volleys or baseline shots, he was able to handle them with ease. The Philippine players' momentum waned, and they were at a loss. Lin and Qiu then won again by a large margin.</p>
<h3>Today at the French Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>This afternoon, there will be three matches. The event is under the jurisdiction of the Old Lawn Tennis Club, so the matches will be held at the French Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Joffre. The main event is Qiu Feihai playing against Qie Weiya again. The order of matches for the Chinese junior player Zheng Zhaojia and Lin Baohua against the Philippine players is as follows:</p>
<p>Singles: Machida (Japan) vs. Bao Lindan (Philippines) - Starting at 3:00 PM</p>
<p>Singles: Qiu Feihai (China) vs. Qie Weiya (Philippines) - Starting at 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Doubles: Zheng Zhaojia &amp; Baohua (China) vs. Qie Weiya &amp; Bao Lindan (Philippines) - Starting at 5:00 PM</p>
<h3>Lin Baohua and Others' Trip to Western Sichuan and Hubei Postponed</h3>
<p>To Compete for the Grass Court Joint Championship and Prepare for a Match Against the Japanese Club, the Trip to Sichuan and Hubei is Postponed; Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang Stay in Shanghai; Lin Baohua and his New Wife Will Travel West with Qiu Feihai and Others.</p>
<p>Due to the two championship competitions, the trip has been decided to be postponed. The China Tennis Association's Group A League this year is highly promising. However, there are still two major enemies to be defeated: the Japanese Tennis Club and the foreign-owned cotton mills. If these two formidable opponents are overcome, the championship will be in hand; otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Therefore, Lin and others have decided to postpone the trip until these two major competitions are completed. As for the companions for the trip to the West, it was originally planned to be Qiu Feihai, Qian Yaobin, Zheng Zhaojia, and Yu Tianguang. Now, Zheng and Yu have decided not to go due to family matters.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Usually, They are People Who Jump from Buildings</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Liang Lvzhu and He Mou’er</p>
<p>Liang Lvzhu was a pearl girl of ancient times, and He Mou’er is a pearl girl of modern times. Lvzhu jumped from a building to her death to avoid being captured, and He Mou’er jumped from a building to her death because of a broken heart. There are many women of strong character in brothels. This is called "Liqueur spring has no source, and Ganoderma grass has no roots."</p>
<p>After Lvzhu's death, many historical sites were left in Bobai, including Lvzhu Tower, Lvzhu River, and Lvzhu Well. Lvzhu is ultimately worshiped to the extreme. After He Mou’er's death, will Hong Kong worship He Mou’er as much as Lvzhu? Alas! I don’t think so. In an era where chastity is bankrupt, most are people who jump from buildings. However, society’s observations are very different.</p>
<p>When He Mou’er was a prostitute in Ipanema, her stage name was Pan Rujun. According to legend, He Mou’er initially changed her stage name to Pan Yuanjun. Later, because the Cantonese pronunciation of “Yuan” sounds like “Yin,” Pan Yuanjun seemed to sound like “hoping for King Yama,” which had a very ominous connotation. She then changed it to Pan Rujun, which contained the aspiration of hoping for a satisfactory lover. Later, she met a certain Mr. Zheng from Zhongshan, and she aspired to be a respectable woman. When the matter was about to succeed, obstacles suddenly arose. Pan Rujun then followed in Lvzhu’s footsteps and jumped from the third floor, breaking two pelvic bones, one arm bone, and several rib bones. She was sent to the National Hospital, where she died that very evening. Mr. Zheng mourned his past love and cried uncontrollably. He spent 800 yuan on funeral expenses and chose a plot of land in Jigan Bay. From then on, a mound of yellow earth would provide a place for tourists to contemplate the breeze.</p>
<p>When resistance against Japan was intense, many men with beards and eyebrows shouted "Rather be jade shattered than tile intact." However, in the end, only intact tiles were seen, and no shattered jade was seen. The only one who really fought to the point of shattered jade was a twenty-year-old brothel girl. Is this not shameful!</p>
<h3>Strange Words from Mr. Wu Zhihui</h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>A few days ago, Wu Zhihui went to Hunan. When he passed through Hankou, he talked about his feelings about the country, divided into two parts. The original text reported is forgotten, but roughly said that there are many Chinese traitors, which is regrettable. When Ambassador Jiang Zuobin was in Japan, he asked former Foreign Minister Shidehara why Japan wanted to invade China. Shidehara said: Many Chinese people send gifts to Japan, and the gifts are very heavy. How can Japan not accept them? Shidehara also cited examples to prove it. He also said that all elderly people in China should be shot because the elderly cannot manufacture guns and cannons. Therefore, he advised young people to quickly become aware and save the country so that they would not be in the category of people who should be shot when they get old. It seems that Wu himself also admitted that he should be shot. These two statements are a bit strange and cannot be agreed with. First, the people who Shidehara referred to as sending gifts to Japan are of course the traitors that Wu referred to as regrettable. We don't believe that under the blue and white flag, there are traitors who are even greater than Cao, Lu, and Zhang in the old days, who gave the land of the four northeastern provinces to Japan as a gift. Even if there were, how could Shidehara be willing to say it so frankly? And how could our Ambassador Jiang have such a straightforward question? That's fine. Wu also said that elderly people who cannot manufacture guns and cannons should be shot, and only young people have the possibility and qualifications to save the country. However, when we examine the facts, it is greatly different and, on the contrary, who among the ruling figures in ancient and modern China and foreign countries are young people? In fact, most of them have white hair and are still strong. Even taking this current national crisis as an example, was it the elderly or the young who lost the Northeast? The British emperor said that the Chinese have young generals, commanding hundreds of thousands of soldiers, specifically appointing young men as generals, and British officers are not promoted to the rank of general until they are over fifty years old." Some elderly Chinese people who personally experienced the Sino-Japanese War have admitted their responsibility for not vigorously promoting their experiences to the younger generation, and did not withdraw from matters because they could not manufacture guns and cannons. Moreover, saving the country does not depend entirely on guns and cannons. Isn't the use of force consistently condemned as barbaric by us Chinese? So why rely entirely on guns and cannons?</p>
<h3>Random Talk about Cartoons</h3>
<p>— (Text by Qian Yun) (Drawing by Lian Liang)</p>
<p>The property of the head of the household is all movable property: a fertile wife and a fat son; then two bundles, four pine boards, a pair of bellows, a pot, two pairs of long benches, a chamber pot, and, what cannot be left out, his own strength; he doesn’t think much about how his life depends on this strength, but pays close attention to his wheelbarrow, but, anyway! They mean the same.</p>
<p>Although they are a close family, the advantage they perceive is only the convenience of being able to load everything on the cart when moving. Aside from the pot lid, even the chamber pot lid is not often opened!</p>
<h3>Carrying a Sedan Chair</h3>
<p>— Laborer</p>
<p>In the realm of material civilization, the old-fashioned sedan chair, aside from remote townships, is still widely used; in prosperous cities, it has been naturally eliminated. Modern means of transportation include motorcycles, electric cars, and automobiles; followed by horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws, etc. As for those who still have an inextricable connection with sedan chairs, aside from a few old gentlemen, doctors are the most (it can be said to be the only).</p>
<p>Friends who are accustomed to riding in sedan chairs can easily recognize the quality of the sedan chair carriers. Aside from being forced to try a few times when traveling in the mountains and rivers, we always feel constrained and unable to accept it. As for the sedan chair carriers’ techniques, we are even less inclined to appreciate them. The reasons for shoulder and elimination are probably based on this.</p>
<p>The most amusing thing that happened in Jiaxing City was the joke of a patrol officer carrying a sedan chair. A gentleman’s daughter was walking on the road, and the police officer, with blurred vision, mistook the delicate young lady for a prostitute and detained her in the bureau. The gentleman was furious and insisted on ruining the careless patrol officer’s career. Later, someone intervened and asked the patrol officer to carry the young lady back in a sedan chair as punishment. The patrol officer transformed into a sedan chair carrier, condescending and lifting the sedan chair with great effort. His skills must have surpassed those of the sedan chair carriers, but the opportunity for a patrol officer to carry a sedan chair is truly rare, and the gentleman’s daughter’s fortune can be said to be not insignificant! The local saying is that in a gambling game, when two gamblers, A and B, communicate information with each other to secretly calculate against the others in the game, it is also called “carrying a sedan chair.” The luck of friends who ride in sedan chairs is thus controlled by the sedan chair carriers. How pitiable and laughable! On the contrary, in the vast land of China, the ways of carrying a sedan chair are certainly not limited to these few. In the poor social conditions, demons and monsters may, if not carefully observed, have the potential to “carry the sedan chair” at any time. With imperialism invading and losing thousands of miles of land, some still sing the high-pitched tune of non-resistance. How could the “sedan chair carriers” of the Three Islands not take the opportunity to carry the sedan chair and reap great profits?</p>
<p>Alas! If the nation, while a breath of life remains, does not become vigilant, a group of foreign sedan chair carriers is watching with predatory eyes, waiting for the opportunity to act. The opportunity to ride in sedan chairs will be endless.</p>
<h3>The Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Hearing Words of Warning, Her Heart Trembles; Wishing to Serve Her Country, But Her Body is Free</p>
<p>This kind of enthusiastic handshake was not only very happy for Gan Ji, but Zhao Ziqiang himself also felt that this action was not ordinary, and ordinary people could not do it - who would be willing to go to a rival in love to find a job? He also said to Mr. Gan, "Don't look at me as a military man, military men also have different opinions." Gan Ji said, "Speaking of which, I am ashamed to say that I didn't understand Company Commander Zhao much before, but now I know I was wrong." After he finished speaking, he became more enthusiastic, constantly offering tea and cigarettes. Zhao Ziqiang also only hoped that he would have this understanding, and after chatting for a while, because the road out of the city was far, he dared not sit for long and bid farewell. He continued to think on the tram and bus:</p>
<p>"Looking at the situation, Gan Zhizhi and the old maid don't seem to have any love. Originally, why would he, a master, want to marry a poor girl? It was unnecessary for me to visit him today. But then again, if I hadn't visited him today, I would never have understood what was going on between him and Yang Guizhi. Now it seems that I was simply suspicious and wrong to suspect a good person. No wonder people say that soldiers have simple minds. I am simple enough. How can it be said that people in the neighborhood will have a love relationship? Since the old maid is not the kind of person I want, then Huang Manying will certainly not reject me if she goes to propose marriage. First, she has good feelings for me. Second, in terms of qualifications and age, I can be her husband, and if she doesn't have someone else in her heart, why should she reject me? There is no doubt that this marriage will be successful. It's just a pity that before today, I always felt that Guizhi was someone who didn't like soldiers and was too indifferent to him. If I had expressed my goodwill to her earlier, I probably wouldn't have needed to ask someone to find out what she was thinking so many times, and this matter would have been successful." (200)</p>

<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Children's New Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>We like to sleep most during the turn of spring and summer. The saying "spring sleep doesn't feel dawn" means "sound sleep," because during the turn of spring and summer, the temperature is about 17 to 18 degrees Celsius, which is the most suitable temperature for our human body. Moreover, in this season, both things of interest and indoor and outdoor sports are more enjoyable than other seasons, so it is not easy to wake up from a sound sleep. However, sleep is a necessary physiological phenomenon for human beings. Daytime activities cause fatigue, and after sleep at night, we can restore physical health. However, how long should human beings sleep? According to ordinary habits, it is roughly seven or eight hours, but it also varies from person to person. Some people can restore fatigue after only sleeping five or six hours. For example, Napoleon usually only slept four or five hours, because his four or five hours could be equivalent to eight or nine hours. Why? Originally, there is a distinction between "sound sleep" and "light sleep." Four or five hours of sound sleep can fully restore all fatigue. If you are often disturbed during sleep and cannot enter a deep dream state, are startled, and your dreams are turned upside down, then even sleeping for a dozen hours will be useless. For ordinary people, the first two hours after falling asleep are the most sound sleep, and as dawn approaches, it gradually becomes light sleep. But there is a kind of person who tosses and turns and cannot fall asleep when going to bed, but then sleeps soundly and is not easily awakened at dawn. This habit of sleeping soundly at dawn is very harmful. Therefore, we usually have to ensure a sound sleep at night. First, we should have appropriate exercise, because after pleasant exercise during the day, we will naturally sleep soundly. However, excessive exercise will prevent us from sleeping peacefully. Second, before going to bed, we must avoid stimulating foods and drinks, such as strong tea and coffee, which should not be ingested. Movies and dramas that are rich in stimulation should not be watched too much. Third, we should not turn on strong lights when sleeping, and the walls of the room should not be decorated with red things. In short, it is most appropriate for us to sleep seven or eight hours normally. If we can sleep soundly, six or seven hours is enough, but we must not oversleep, because oversleeping can cause lethargic encephalitis.</p>
<p>Snacks</p>
<p>Generally, children like to snack every day, especially sweets. However, irregular snacking often reduces the amount of regular staple food. Because there is no fixed time, no fixed amount of snacks that only satisfy our oral desires, hinder physical development, and cause dangerous diseases. Usually, our regular meals are enough for three times a day. However, in the infancy period, the nutrients obtained from three main meals a day are not sufficient, so we have to give snacks to supplement them. After seven or eight years old, we should gradually eliminate snacks. Moreover, the unhygienic foods sold on the streets are the media for infectious diseases, and indiscriminate eating of indefinite quantities harms the digestion of the stomach and intestines and reduces the original nutrients. Among snacks, the most important thing to pay attention to is that beans are the most likely to cause intestinal catarrh, and red beans and peanuts are the inducing agents of dysentery. Salt biscuits and honey cakes damage the absorption of the stomach. Especially the various candies of recent years contain excessive amounts of sulfurous acid, which hinders oxygen and pollutes the blood. Therefore, after we pass the infancy period, we must not be greedy for the desires of the tongue and eat snacks arbitrarily. Outside of the three main meals, we should eliminate anything, and moreover, in childhood, young children are partial to or sweet or salty fruits, and gradually develop the habit of being partial to food. When we grow up, we cannot easily change it.</p>
<p>Housing</p>
<p>Generally, aristocratic families with tall buildings and mansions are not suitable for children to live in, because the education of children's character, the maintenance of health, and the suitability of games should have the following conditions: First, it should be able to be taken care of and approached by both parents and protectors. Second, the location of the house should be towards the southeast, which is beneficial to sunlight and hygiene. Third, the game room, bedroom, and toilet should be nearby. Fourth, there should be wipeable boards for children to write freely. Fifth, there should be realistic paintings on the walls of the room. Sixth, the bed is easy to tidy up and very convenient to sleep in. Seventh, the windows should be large and low so that they can be viewed from the outside. According to the above ideal conditions, two rooms are very comfortable for children to live in. If it is too large, not only can it not be taken care of, but also the daily life and actions are very inconvenient.</p>

<h3>Talking about Bats</h3>
<p>— You Guang</p>
<p>People can’t help but dislike animals that come out at night, probably because they just don’t sleep, which is different from their own habits, and also because they are afraid that they will see any secrets in the dark sleep or slight walk. Although bats are also nocturnal animals, their reputation in China is still good. This is not because they eat mosquitoes, which is beneficial to people, but mostly because their name sounds the same as the word "fu" (福), meaning "fortune." It is really thanks to the good name that they can be written into paintings with such a respectable appearance. Also, it is because Chinese people originally wanted to be able to fly themselves, and also imagined that other things could fly. Taoists want to become immortals, emperors want to ascend to heaven, lovers want to be lovebirds flying together, and those who suffer can't wait to grow wings and fly away. The thought of tigers with wings is chilling, but the sight of green coins flying is endearing. As for Mozi's flying kite, it was finally lost, and airplanes had to be purchased from foreign countries with donations. This is because too much emphasis was placed on spiritual civilization, which was inevitable and reasonable, and not at all strange. But although it can't be done, it can be imagined. So, seeing something that looks like a mouse with wings is not surprising at all. Famous writers even want to include it in their poems, composing such beautiful lines as "At dusk, bats fly to the temple." Westerners don't have such high sentiments. They don't like bats. I think the source of the disaster should probably be attributed to Aesop. His fable said that island animals held a conference. The bat went to the animal class, but because it had wings, the animal class did not accept it. The bat went to the bird class, but because it had four feet, the bird class did not accept it. It ended up having no position. Therefore, everyone disliked the bat, which was used as a symbol.</p>
<p>China has recently picked up some Western classics and sometimes ridicules bats. But this kind of fable came from Aesop, which is commendable, because in his time, zoology was still very immature. It is different now. What category whales belong to and what category bats belong to is clear to even elementary school students. If you still pick up some Greek classics to talk seriously, it only shows that your knowledge is the same as that of the two classes of gentlemen and ladies who attended the conference in Aesop's time.</p>
<p>Professor Liang Shiqiu of the university believes that rubber shoes are something between straw shoes and leather shoes, which is similar in knowledge. If he had been born in Greece, his position would probably be below Aesop. It is a pity that he was born too late.</p>
<h3>A Snapshot of the Times</h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>In movies, there's something called a "closeup," which is to especially enlarge a certain detail or change the temporality of a certain process. The former is like expanding a pair of tearful eyes to fill the entire screen, and the latter is like making raindrops fall extraordinarily slowly onto lotus leaves. It's unreasonable to try to explain this rationally; there are absolutely no eyes that big or raindrops that slow in the real world. It's almost absurd, but the audience at the time doesn't think it's absurd. Instead, they feel like it should be that way. It's the same with literary creation. Writers often describe a certain important part in exceptional detail or use adjectives that are "over the top." Examples of this can be found in every piece of work, so there's no need to say more.</p>
<p>The present era and society are also in "closeup."</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, look: big capitalists earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in a minute, while workers toil and sweat all year but don't even earn what a capitalist does in a minute of a day. The rich live a life of extravagance and debauchery, while the poor live in hunger and hardship. These many "closeups" of society are almost unimaginable, yet this era is constantly in "closeup" and deepening this "closeup" every day. If we were to faithfully present the "closeups" of present society on the screen without any embellishment, I'm afraid everyone would think that these are just "closeups" on the screen and wouldn't believe that they are indeed "closeups" of the times! The "closeups" of the current era and society have developed to a shockingly unreasonable extent, even more so than those in movies or literature. The main reason why young people are confused is that they haven't experienced the "closeups" of this era. To understand the "closeups" of this era and society, one should live in the most cutting-edge metropolis of capitalism, which in China is Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Dogs and the People Who Keep Them</h3>
<p>— Tang Xun</p>
<p>In recent years, dogs have had good fortune, and people have been paying attention to the art of raising dogs. This world is full of all kinds of dogs.</p>
<p>When I was young, I heard from the elders that there was a "heavenly dog" in the sky that chased the moon every night. When it was about to catch up, it would hold it in its mouth and try to swallow it, which was a lunar eclipse. But the affairs of heaven are difficult to understand, and at the time, I just listened haphazardly. Later, when I came to Shanghai and saw the spectacle of dog racing, I suddenly understood that even the likes of the "Jade Emperor" and "Guanyin Bodhisattva" enjoyed this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Although I don't know if the "heavenly dog" looks the same as the dogs we see every day, I can say that there are many dogs in the human world that are no less than the "heavenly dog."</p>
<p>Let's talk about dogs that are good at chasing! We can often see them at dog racing tracks and hunting grounds. They have distinctions such as Beagles, Harriers, Whippets, Afghan, Basset, Elk, and Foxhounds. Most of the dogs at the Shanghai dog racing track are Greyhounds. These dogs, with their arched backs and emaciated bellies, look like "upright gentlemen" who are content with their poverty. But it's actually a tragedy. They chase their target with all their might, but what they catch never fills their own stomachs. This is because they are dogs. There are two other kinds. One is Terriers, with distinctions such as Airedale, Bedlington, Border, Cairn, and Dandie Dinmont. The other is Setters, which are used for reconnaissance and can be divided into English, Gordon, Spaniels, and other categories. These dogs are small in stature but very alert and well-suited to chasing and scouting smaller animals such as wild rabbits and weasels. They are skilled at scheming and seeking everywhere to please their masters. They wear ferocious masks and have sensitive noses. They are fierce and treacherous. This world is entirely their world, and few weak animals can escape their sense of smell. But they are still dogs.</p>
<p>Finally, we must mention Toys. The so-called Toys are the likes of Pekingese dogs that Mr. Lu Xun liked to beat. They also have many types, the common ones being Poodles, Griffons, and Pugs, and our domestic Poos. Their shape is between cats and dogs, pleasing people with their clever and shiny fur. They have no special skills, but they are born with a clown's face and are accustomed to wagging their tails and offering flattery, exclusively for the "leisure class to play with." Women mostly love dogs, especially Pekingese. At dance halls, movie theaters, in cars, and on the streets, you can always see many fragrant Pekingese following behind plump buttocks. As for those loved by the wealthy, they are said to be of the old Russian breed: these things are not alert, but they are born very tall and seem to have some power. Therefore, one must have a dog for every car. When they are not needed, they stay at home to relieve the boredom of the wives and young ladies; in the end, they are still dogs.</p>
<p>The most flattering are dogs; those willing to sacrifice their nature to be used by others are also dogs; those who bark madly at tattered clothes, telling you the great truth that poor people are not allowed to enter grand mansions, needless to say, are still dogs.</p>
<h3>A New Interpretation of Old Opera Percussion</h3>
<p>— Luo Fu</p>
<p>Mr. He Ru discusses drama in "Free Talk," saying that Dr. Mei replied to Master Weng, "China has its own drama," which cannot be separated from percussion… "As far as Kunqu Opera is concerned, isn't percussion used?" He cites Li Yu's words on percussion as his example, but unfortunately, he cannot help but say, "Li Yu's theory was made when Kunqu Opera was declining," which is the biggest loophole in his example.</p>
<p>"The distant origin of Chinese drama comes from wrestling," is the Three Character Classic of Chinese drama history; "Our old opera does not abandon martial arts and percussion," is the same as "Wrestling and martial arts must have gongs and drums to show advance and retreat and to strengthen the formation," which is also an indisputable theory. But when did wrestling and acrobatics blend with Chinese drama, and when did percussion officially enter our old opera? Mr. He Ru cannot help but easily overlook these questions.</p>
<p>Gu Qiyuan's "Guest Seat Words" on the drama of the Southern Capital in the Ming Dynasty can provide a new interpretation of Mr. He Ru's "Old Opera Percussion Theory." "Guest Seat Words" says:</p>
<p>Before the Wanli period in the Southern Capital, dukes, nobles, gentry, and wealthy families mostly used San Yue for banquets and small gatherings, either three or four people or more singing a large set of Northern tunes, with instruments such as zheng, xiao, pipa, sanxian, and clappers. For larger banquets, they would use the workshop to perform court dramas and large quadraphonic Northern tunes, interspersed with cuo dian quan, Dancing Guanyin, or Hundred Flags or jumping teams. Later, it gradually changed to using Southern singing, with only a small clapper or a fan instead of it, and sometimes drums and boards were used. Now, Wu people increasingly use the dongxiao and yueqin, and the tone has changed repeatedly, becoming more and more mournful, and listeners almost want to shed tears. It can be seen that before and after the Wanli period in the Ming Dynasty, Northern and Southern tunes did not use percussion at all. But at this time, it wasn't that "there was also one that didn't use it," as Dr. Mei said; more accurately, it was that "Southern tunes initially did not use percussion."</p>
<p>Later, because there was Kunqu Opera that used percussion, as Li Yu said in his theory, it took on an opposing form to Kunqu Opera that did not use percussion. This example is not difficult to see; reading "Dream of the Red Chamber" will show that the doctor's theory is not false.</p>
<p>Percussion entered old opera because wrestling and acrobatics blended with old opera and became the martial arts part of old opera. But martial arts had not yet blended with old opera, only interspersed with cuo dian quan and other tricks outside of "wenxi." Old opera would not have percussion, which becomes an irremovable reason based on Mr. He Ru's assumption. Moreover, although the current martial arts is also a part of old opera, it is still a kind of juggling tail, reluctantly active in old opera. Since Mr. He Ru acknowledges that percussion invaded old opera at the same time as martial arts, why does he assert that "Chinese opera must use percussion," that "from the very beginning, drama cannot be separated from percussion," and not realize that its invasion, like martial arts, is also reluctantly active in old opera?</p>

<h3>Gold Futures and Silver Continue to Decline; Premium Remains Firm</h3>
<p>(Process Seems Monotonous, Result Slightly Up Three Yuan) The gold market was stable for half a day yesterday. Initially, the British pound plummeted, and the US dollar also shrank. In addition, the forward silver price continued to decline. Although commodity prices and stocks rose, they were not taken into account. The gross trading was good immediately. After opening, banks uniformly offered, and the exchange rate tended to ease. After falling, it immediately stabilized and formed a state of hovering. Afterwards, the banks continued to offer. Reuters reported slightly on rising commodity prices and the wheat agreement being expected to be established, reducing wheat exports. It once broke through the 900 yuan mark because of this, but in an instant, rumors spread that a certain Western merchant was buying heavily, and people's hearts rebounded again, and the recovery was extremely rapid. The noon closing was still flat. There were no special characteristics in the half-day process. The Guangdong gang came to sell instead, making it difficult to rise again. The Kazakh price was increased by 110 yuan as usual, and the underground market price was increased by 109 yuan as usual. The half-day market situation will be recorded today.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 909.5 yuan, which was 7.5 yuan higher than the previous close. Commodities opened at 9.3 yuan. The exchange rate opened, and both the British and American currencies were tight. The recent selling price was calculated as 1 shilling 2 pence 9375 for the British exchange rate and 26.25 yuan for the US exchange rate. Hengxing, Chunyuan, Yong Shen Kang, Dadecheng, Zhengchang, Hongli, Zhaofengchang, Jilailai, and Baochu opened. Macari opened July 3125, Midway 375, and September 8125, with no buyers. The situation then deteriorated, falling from 910 yuan to 01.5 yuan. Bingxing and Hengyu Hengxing bought at a low price and returned to 5.5 yuan. However, because Hongli and Richang were still selling, Shanghai offered US dollars at 27 yuan for October, and the exchange rate hardened. HSBC's listing revealed that the British pound shrank by 125, while the US dollar remained flat. Huabi opened US dollars at 8125 for September, which still dropped to 2.5 yuan. At this time, it was quiet for a very long time. Yuankangxiang entered from time to time, once trading outside of 4 yuan and then continued to fall. Later, Yuanheng, Yuanchun, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, and Honglizhengchang competed to sell, because Mitsui offered US dollars at 875 for September. It was difficult to sell again. Foreign telegrams slightly reported favorable news on commodity prices. It broke the 900 yuan mark during the period and fell to 898.5 yuan. However, this price was only sold in small quantities by Yuanmaoyong, which was very rare. Dadecheng limited 9 yuan, which was still rare. Tongtaichang bought forcefully at the price of 9.5 yuan, and gradually pulled it up. The news that a Western merchant's broker was buying premiums heavily spread throughout the venue, and people's hearts were boosted, and a rising trend immediately appeared. Yuanmaoyong, Zhi Yongfu, Fuyu, Dadecheng, and Cuitai and others bought in groups. The internal market followed and tightened. It reached 08.5 yuan in an uproar. Meifeng Citibank jointly offered US dollars at 625 for August. Hengxing sold to 6 yuan. Datong ate in at 625 for August and rose to 7 yuan. Yuanheng, Bingxing, and Yuanmao sold and retreated to 5 yuan. The noon closing was 905 yuan. US dollars at 9375 for October were not offered by the bank. The price was pulled up once after the closing, but then it was still low. Commodities were sold at the same price. The highest price during the half day was 910 yuan, and the lowest price was 898.5 yuan, with a difference of 11.5 yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 3 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>

The registered price for this month was 927 yuan, 915 yuan for July, and 905 yuan for August. The morning water supplement was 927 yuan. The Kazakh price was increased by 110 yuan as usual. The customer gang's demand for goods was all between 109 yuan as usual, but the supply was still small. There were still 2,597 remaining tickets for this month and 2,989 tickets for July.</p>
<p>The trading in the venue was stable, and the situation was also very average. The potential seemed drier. In summary, Hengxing, Shenkang, Hongli, Zhaofengchang, Zhengchang, Chunyuan, Yong Richang, Yifeng, Yong Yuanmao, etc. were on the selling side, while Wanxing, Shunli, Cuitai, Tongtaichang, Yuankangxiang, Yuanxing, Yong Qianchangxiang were on the buying side.

<h3>The Bullish Force in Securities and Public Bonds is Relatively Weak</h3>
<p>) Falling Two, Three Jiao to Six Jiao (</p>
<p>) Only Short-Term Financial Rose Six Jiao (</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange fluctuated slightly, it was still related to the chips of the long and short sides. Both sides mutually closed out or swapped positions. The bullish side was relatively weak. The market opened in the morning because the situation in North China was still quite complicated. The puppet army had not been resolved, and there were still problems with the Chahar incident. The market was more volatile. Northern gangs sold out when the market opened, and the market uniformly fell by two, three jiao to seven jiao or so. Among them, the most popular was the 16th Bao Twenty Volume, so it fell by 7.5 jiao, which was also the largest. In the second market, there were still bulls coming out or swapping positions. Except for the Twenty Volume of this month, which was slightly better by one jiao or so, the rest continued to fall by three or four jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the platform slightly covered the shorts, and it seemed to recover slightly by two or three jiao, but it still felt weak after entering.

The daily market price resulted in a drop of about two, three jiao to six jiao. The short-term financial public bond rose by six jiao, but the rise and fall of this public bond has not yet been regulated, so it is not enough as a standard for the market. The total number of transactions was 12,856,000 yuan, of which 6,000 yuan were spot goods, and the futures unified salt tax accounted for 4,650,000, the demobilization accounted for 1,881,000, the 19 customs duties accounted for 1,440,000, the 20 volume 20 customs duties accounted for 2,310,000, the 96 accounted for 1,380,000, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 350,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Fell First and Then Rose</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on Friday) 23rd (New York stock market fluctuated uncertainly. Later, due to news from Canada that the wheat crop there had suffered alarming damage, and because spot goods were surprisingly strong, wheat soared by more than two points. The agricultural stock shorts rushed to cover their positions. At the same time, French Finance Minister Bonnet denied that France intended to abandon the gold standard, so the market situation suddenly rose sharply in the last hour, and transactions also turned prosperous. According to general observers, yesterday's fall and today's rise seem to be due to speculators testing the market. The total number of transactions for the day was 3,331,000 shares. Also, although there were long positions closing in cotton, the report of acreage reduction was increasingly favorable, and futures rose 16 to 25 pounds. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left. Closing prices compared to the previous day. Thirty industrial stocks 95.53, up 2.60. Twenty railroad stocks 44.56, up 1.37. Twenty utility stocks 34.72, up 1.24. Forty bonds 84.99, up 0.01.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Were Boosted by Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market tended to rise, and the situation was slightly better. Because raw cotton rose, the interdependent yarn market was boosted somewhat, but the actual demand was still sluggish. All gangs had no purchases, and the inventory in the yarn and cloth warehouse was still heavy, so the pressure was still great. In short, the current yarn digestion is too small, and the rising power is relatively lacking.</p>
<p>(Human Standard Rose More Than One Yuan) The Human Standard market opened in the previous market. Due to the rise in foreign cotton, people's hearts were good, and scattered shorts covered their positions, with each month rising seven, eight, nine jiao to one yuan and two jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation was still flat. Later, the cotton market was firm and strong, and the yarn market was boosted by one, two, three, and four jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 38,050 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 850 bales, Jifeng 1,600 bales, Yukang 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 1,400 bales, Yuantai 1,300 bales, Yichang 1,950 bales, and Xinhua 1,200 bales.

<h3>Cotton Bull Market Increases Bets</h3>
<p>The upward trend in cotton futures remains strong. Because American cotton has rebounded, buyers, especially foreign firms, are eager to squeeze short positions. This has led short sellers to cover their positions. In the afternoon, bull positions were bought and increased in larger quantities, causing the market to rise further. However, some are selling off American cotton purchased on credit by the National Government, with approximately 50,000 bales expected to arrive in Shanghai around the middle of next month.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao up half a yuan strongly) Zheng Biao: The market opened, the market sentiment was strong, and foreign cotton also rose. There were more buyers in the market, and prices rose by two or three jiao for each month. In the afternoon, there were bull purchases, and prices rose by another three or four jiao for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 103,000 dan. Sales included 6,200 dan from Gengfeng, 1,600 dan from Jifeng, 1,100 dan from Changfeng, 2,400 dan from Shenchang, 4,300 dan from Yuanda, and 1,900 dan from Yifeng.

The closing prices are recorded below: October 45.05 up 5.5, balance 140,900, June 47.20 up 5.0, balance 33,500, November 44.90 5.0, balance 101,100, July 47.20 5.0, balance 115,100, Total 564,900, August 47.00 7.0, balance 174,200.</p>
<p>(Spot Cotton Mills' Appetite Slightly Moving) The spot cotton business is flat, but as futures tend to rise, mills are showing slight interest. No arrivals have been reported at the wharves. Spot prices are listed on the left: Shashi cotton 45.75, Shenxin imported 100 pieces sent to the factory, Luoyang cotton 49.00 plus another 200 pieces, Bao flower 50.00 plus another 1,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rebounds Due to Lack of Rainfall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rebounded due to a lack of rain in the drought areas. News from Liverpool was good, and buyers increased, resulting in a firm and active market. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 16 to 19 points per pound. Spot prices in the Liverpool cotton market fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 4 to 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering, resulting in a flat increase of 2 rupees and 7.5 jiao for Pinggar, an increase of 2 rupees and 2.5 jiao for Omra, and an increase of 3 rupees for Bairuo.</p>

<h3>American New Cotton Crop Climate Good</h3>
<p>New York, June 23rd telegram reporting on the weekly cotton market conditions, the theory of currency inflation is gradually being trusted. General trade has clear evidence of continued progress, and private news also says that the authorities' plan to reduce cotton fields is endorsed by cotton farmers, especially in the western cotton belt. Therefore, for various reasons, buying is booming and the spot cotton price this week is high. As prices gradually approach the highest level in May, there are some settlements and scattered arbitrage sales, but the number of sales is absorbed when the market price slightly retraces. Except for a few places in Texas and Oklahoma that need rain, the general climate is still suitable for cotton production. However, the impact of the good climate has been offset by the proposal to reduce cotton fields. It is heard that Japan has sought to purchase all of the cotton production in the San Joaquin Valley of California, about 150,000 bales. The cotton cloth market is stable but feels quiet, because it wants to wait for the development of procedural donations and the official field's advocacy for reducing weekly working hours and minimum wage proposals.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Softens Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than thirty sources came from the south of Shanghai, but the outgoing routes from this street are still not smooth. In addition, guest gangs such as Tianjin Weihaiwei, etc., are handling matters, and it is especially difficult to find opportunities for a while. Therefore, local Shanghai clients have no intention of handling matters. Only the Nanyang gang purchased five or six hundred bags of Bo Dao rice, so the market situation is extremely sluggish. Chang Bang, Su Tong Bang, South Port Hou Geng, and Qing Jiao Song Si Xi Lian and other Bo Dao rice prices have all fallen slightly. Du Yang Jian is still stable, and there is not much change in the price of the Bian Yin Yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about twenty sources came from the river. The sales of Bai Geng were sluggish, and the market price dropped slightly. Early Bo Dao rice arrived in small quantities and sales were slow, so the price was fixed, while medium-grade rice tended to weaken. Du Jian and Bian Yuan were also weak, but Yang Jian arrived in small quantities and sales were active. The market situation was stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Continues to be Sold in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the guest Xian rice market was sluggish because the Min Bang stopped operating, and there were no whole bag transactions on the market. Since sales were sluggish, the market looked weak. However, the local Xiang rice market was expected to rise due to rising water levels. Both Gan Xian arrivals and sales were low. However, Wan Xian still had some sales from this street and the Zhejiang Bang, especially the rough Xian rice was active. Yesterday, the Tongshi Wenta and Ningbo Bang purchased 274 bags of Nanjing rough rice at a price of 6.54 to 6.49 yuan. 137 bags of Wuxi machine rice were purchased at a price of 7.44 yuan.</p>
<p>The newly arrived Saigon No. 1 foreign rice was not sold because the cargo owner raised the price, and the outgoing routes were not strong. The Min Bang had already ordered futures and inland rough rice and had no intention of handling the current foreign rice again. Yesterday, only the Ningbo Bang purchased 955 bags of Xiaojiao rice at a price of 7.58 yuan, sold by Xiangmao. The quality of the goods was slightly lower than before, but the profit was also reduced by 7 cents.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Not Good in the Near or Distant Future</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of fatigue and sluggishness after opening in the morning. It is expected that the floods in Yang Qing and other places will subside at the appropriate time, and the arrival of wheat in various places will also be greatly facilitated. Moreover, judging from the situation of wheat production in various places, Wuxi already has 3 million arrivals, and the rest are also continuously strengthening. Prices will also follow suit, and people's minds are relaxed for this reason. Because delivery is approaching this month, bulls have to unload their positions. In the long term, small factories are releasing some stocks, so the trend is not good. When the market opened in the afternoon, because actual sales were very quiet this month, some people instead resold their positions, but their goods were genuinely received, and the quantity was not large. On the factory side, dumping was also slow. Whether Yang will cast off goods as wheat is purchased depends on whether the wheat purchase is gradual, but the overall trend is not good, and the recent performance is weak. As a result, the current month fell by 1.5 cents compared to the previous day, July fell by 1.25 cents, August fell by 0.5 cents, September fell by 0.15 cents, and October fell by 0.5 cents, and November fell by 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Buyers and Sellers Equally Matched</h3>
<p>Spot high priced goods hold steady, middle grade goods are discounted. Yesterday, wheat futures largely showed a trend of consolidation in each month after opening in the morning and afternoon. With the foreign price for American wheat rising by 5 to 7 jiao and Canadian wheat falling by 3 to 4 jiao, the mood of those outside the industry has inevitably stabilized. However, those in the industry still expect a downward trend, because once the weather improves, the arrival of wheat will boom. The absorption capacity of factories will not be as great as in previous years. Just talking about the matter, there is a possibility that the expiration will be small. The upper and lower markets rose and fell little because the buyers and sellers were evenly matched. As a result, the current month was down by 0.1 cents, August and September were unchanged, October was up by 0.2 cents, and November was up by 0.1 cents. The spot wheat market high-priced goods were still able to hold steady, and middle-grade goods were cut by about 0.5 cents. Gaoyou Taizhou wheat opened at 3.7 jiao and 0.5 cents, Puzhen Hezhou wheat opened at 3.6 jiao and 0.1 cents, Kunshan wheat opened at 3.6 jiao and 0.7 cents, followed by 6.2 cents, Zhitang wheat opened at 3.5 jiao and 0.7 cents, Shuangfeng wheat opened at 3.6 jiao, followed by 5.5 cents, Yangzhou wheat opened at 3.7 jiao, followed by 6.8 cents, Nanjing wheat opened at 3.7 jiao, followed by 6.1 cents, Wuhu wheat opened at 3.6 jiao and 8 cents, and Hankou wheat has also recently been imported, opening at 3.6 jiao and 5 cents. The arrival of wheat from various routes is also strong, opening at 3.5 jiao and 8 cents, followed by 5 jiao, with a total opening of more than 8,000 yuan. Fuxin handled 4,000 bags, Fufeng handled 3,000 bags, and Huafeng handled 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Silk and New Cocoons Displayed Separately</h3>
<p>(Anhui New Cocoons Sent to Factories for Trial Reeling) Anhui Province has a bumper harvest of spring cocoons, but few Shanghai silk merchants have gone to Anhui to collect cocoons. New dried cocoons have been shipped to Shanghai. Anhui cocoon merchants have been sending sample cocoons to various silk factories for trial reeling in recent days, so that they can negotiate transactions.</p>
<p>(New Silk Samples Sent to Europe and America) Various silk factories in this port are now starting up their machines to reel new cocoons. Samples of this year's new silk have been seen. Each manufacturer is sending new silk samples to various foreign firms to test the tensile strength and color, and packing them for shipment to various silk mills in Europe and America for trial use.</p>
<p>(Rayon Sales Clear, Prices Firm) With fluctuating exchange rates, rayon prices remain firm, but guest purchases are sluggish. Yesterday, the Hangzhou and Shaoxing gangs purchased 26 boxes of July futures of Liu Hai, Flying Horse, and Double Star brands, at prices ranging from 179.75 yuan to 164 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Spot Factory Needs Quite High) Overseas silk prices continue to rise, and spot factory needs for white silk are quite high. Yesterday morning, the telegraph transfer was not weak. However, the manufacturers' prices were slightly too high, making transactions difficult. Yesterday, only Lan Lewei and others purchased 60 packages of Shanghai white silk and 30 packages of Sichuan silk, and the prices were all firm and rising.</p>
<h3>Red and Green Tea Transactions Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market in this port saw exceptionally strong transactions in both Keemun and Fuliang red teas and Lu'an Ping-Shui green teas. Total transactions across the city were recorded at 4,952 boxes. The first batch of top-grade high village Keemun tea opened at a topping price of 140 taels, with little change from the previous day. Among green teas, the best-selling were high-grade Chou Xin Zhen Mei, followed by Zhen Mei and Zhu Cha, which were also sold as soon as they arrived. The market overall was very firm, although low-grade Zhen Mei tea sales remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Stabilizes After Falling</h3>
<p>After the sharp rise in white tung oil prices, foreign firms slowed their buying somewhat, and the market price, due to the excessive rise, suffered a setback as soon as it paused. The highest price in the Hankou market was 28 yuan per dan for foreign firms, but it quickly retraced to slightly over 26 yuan. In Hangzhou, the highest price was still 28 yuan per shi. Seeing the Hankou market turn down, it also followed suit and fell, recently dropping to 25 yuan delivered to Shanghai. Therefore, prices in both the Hankou and Hangzhou markets have fallen by two or three yuan from their previous highs. However, according to details in letters from Hankou, it seems that foreign firms have a continuing delivery trend. It is likely that delivery cannot be measured outside of 26 yuan, so there may be a turnaround after the fall. It is heard that Xiang Tong merchants in the Hankou market opened at a purchase price of slightly less than 22 yuan, while the selling price was slightly above 21 yuan. In Hangzhou, the previous day's 25 yuan could still be slightly reduced. However, the turnaround in the Hankou market should also be slightly firmer. Local firms in this port already have thick inventories, and the sales market is appropriately moldy, inevitably diminishing the color, so they do not seem to pay much attention to imports.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White and Drawn Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market strengthened further due to the increase in customs gold and the slight contraction in the Dutch exchange rate. The public association drew the price of No. 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods up to 19.92 yuan, and the slightly coarser particles were 9.4 yuan. No. 20 medium sand white was not drawn. No. 89 Dutch Red KNG Mark was still 16.05 yuan. The local factory white sugar has a competitive intention, so Zhenji No. 1 was reduced by another 0.05 yuan, opening at 19.40 yuan, No. 2 at 2 jiao, No. 3 at 19 yuan, No. 4 at 18.80 yuan, and No. 5 at 6 jiao. China factory goods are still willing to reduce the price further without forming a market. Recently, green sugar sales have been quite active due to the scarcity of inventory and active sales. It is found that Zhang Diao Qing Hao still has more than 700 pieces in stock, and the firms are negotiating prices, and it is expected that a market can be formed today.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Zhengzhou Vegetables Arriving in Hankou Soon</h3>
<p>Golden needles are now approaching the time for new production. The earliest ones should be Zhengzhou vegetables. According to yesterday's Hankou news, they will arrive in Hankou soon. It is heard that this year's production is still good. The approximate first price is expected to be in the range of 23-24 taels.</p>
<h3>Lead transactions have been very few recently because, during</h3>
<p>the moldy season, various gangs have reduced their intake. Guest gangs have no major sales channels due to the urgency of silver funds. Although the overseas market is firm, this port is ultimately showing a sluggish appearance. It is estimated that each dan is worth 16.7 yuan, which is another 0.2 yuan less than before. If there are large transactions, some people are willing to sell at 16.6 yuan. The weakness of the market is already visible.</p>

<h3>The Self-Determination of the Adous</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Beiping special telegram in this newspaper: "The Luan East puppet army: there is still no solution. The Japanese Kwantung Army is still taking a delaying attitude, and has not yet provided concrete answers to the various items we have proposed. Recently, the rebels have even announced their independence in Luan East, hoping to develop a special force..." etc. The fact that the puppet army of Li Jichun, Hao Peng, Li Qingshan, etc. is manipulated by the Japanese is certainly an unquestionable fact. Recently, although the authorities have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese to ask them to abide by the "Ceasefire Agreement" and withdraw their troops quickly, the Japanese, on the one hand, excuse that our Zhangjiakou incident has not been resolved, and refuse to completely hand over the various parts of Luan East. On the other hand, they use the puppet army as a mask, do not come forward themselves, and feign deafness, ignoring everything. The Chinese authorities, besides making representations to Japan, are at a loss and only anxious. If we pay a little attention to the cause and effect of this so-called "Ceasefire Agreement" and see the current situation of being deceived so pitifully, and think about the future of the Chinese nation being oppressed, should we be content to be Adous, listening to a group of self-proclaimed but actually unfilial Zhuge Liangs and Jiang Weis, to compromise and seek peace, muddling through to maintain a mixed-up situation, or should we make our own plans, strive to invigorate, pay attention to all the important national policies that we should pay attention to, and organize ourselves to be a strong backing for the government on the outside, and supervise the government's facilities on the inside. We deeply feel that if this kind of public power can be gradually developed from now on, it is really a ray of dawn for the future of national revival. Whether we have the courage and determination to rush towards this promising future is up to the self-determination of our group of Adous!</p>
<p>While writing this, the reporter suddenly remembered a sentence he heard on the tram the day before yesterday: "Forget it! In this era, it's best to be a silent, obedient, and contented young man!" This sentence was said by an old man in his sixties with gray hair to a young friend in his twenties. As for what the young man said, I didn't hear it clearly, but the general idea was nothing more than discussing the many kidnapping and assassination events that he had heard in recent months, especially the disappearance of Ding Ling, the murder of Ma Shaowu, and the assassination of Tang, the manager of the Great World, and Yang Quan, the general director of the Academia Sinica. Judging from the young man's tone, he seemed to be holding an infinite sense of pessimism and indignation. I heard him say the following discontinuous sentences at the end: "Is this still a world? The Chinese are as tame as sheep to foreigners, but as fierce as jackals to their own people, which is really infuriating!"</p>
<p>We believe that there must be many people who sympathize with this young man, but we believe that there must be even more people who sympathize with the old man, so many that they cannot be counted! Because "being obedient and contented" is the temperament that the Adous have become accustomed to, as for pessimism, indignation, and what organization, striving to invigorate, that is something that is easy to say but difficult to do, and is not the strength of the Adous. However, saving the country and the nation is a very difficult task. Seeing those who sell out the country and the nation, even joining forces with the enemy to suppress and kill those whose interests conflict with them, they will not hesitate to do so! Adous! Will you still avoid difficulties and choose the easy way, be content to be Adous, or would you rather shed blood for freedom and sovereignty, unwilling to "be obedient and contented" and live as a walking corpse? This is entirely up to your self-determination.</p>
<p>)Life(Nine Grandmothers' Homes Long Kong)Poor Friends in Western Suits (In Shanghai, old poor friends in western suits probably all know that "Wusong Road" in Hongkou. There, there are rows of pawnshops lined up like an array, which are the treasure troves of our poor friends: treating it like their own grandmother's house.</p>
<p>These days, because the owed rent and meal fees in the board and lodging shop are due, and I don't have a penny on me, I am really chilled by the cold face of the landlady and the vicious sneer of the boss of the board and lodging shop. I had to endure the pain and send a new Western suit that I had worn for three months to Grandma's treasure trove!</p>
<p>As I approached Grandma's house, the first thing that caught my eye was the old Western suits hanging at the entrance, which had been forfeited because poor friends had no money to redeem them, fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>I stepped into the door of the first pawnshop, placed the package of clothes under my arm on the counter, and pretended to be an experienced person. The shop assistant inside the counter opened the package of clothes, lifted the collar of the upper garment, and observed it from all sides, then looked at the trousers and then the vest, and then looked at my face and said:</p>
<p>"How much to pawn?"</p>
<p>"How much do you say?" I asked back.</p>
<p>"Two yuan."</p>
<p>When I heard him spit out the words "two yuan," I took a breath of cold air in my heart, thinking: Damn it, your conscience is not ruthless! I spent thirty-five yuan to make this suit.</p>
<p>"Can you give me ten yuan?"</p>
<p>"Hum! No way!" He seemed to have already seen through my heart and my poor appearance.</p>
<p>"Then how about eight yuan? I'm going to redeem it."</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Research: The Future of the World Economic Conference</h3>
<p>— Lü</p>
<p>)Current Affairs Research( The world economic panic, which began in 1929 and continued for four years, has not only completely destroyed the achievements of relative capitalist stability, but also deepened the degree of panic day by day. At the same time, the Soviet Union, a socialist country, completed its first five-year plan in four years, laying its economic foundation. This has led the working masses in imperialist countries, as well as</p>
<p>The small and weak nations and oppressed people in colonies and semi-colonies are becoming increasingly "reactionary" in the face of such a clear contrast. Therefore, on the one hand, the class struggle in imperialist countries is becoming more acute; on the other hand, the Second World War, which is being waged by various imperialist countries to re-divide the world market, is also becoming increasingly imminent. The result of this war will inevitably weaken the strength of world capitalism, and even completely eliminate it. Under such circumstances, British imperialism proposed at the Lausanne Conference last year that an economic conference be convened this year in an attempt to save the increasingly collapsing fate of capitalism at this conference, that is, to find a way out of the capitalist crisis.</p>
<p>The conference opened on the 12th of this month, and there are six major topics for discussion: 1. Currency and credit policy; 2. Prices; 3. Capital movement issues; 4. Restrictions on international trade; 5. Tariffs and agreement policies; 6. Organization of production and trade. From the opening speech of the British Emperor and the opening speech of the conference chairman MacDonald, it can be known that imperialist countries hope that this conference will be quite successful.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, in fact, when the actual methods of discussing these issues were first started, conflicts immediately occurred between the various imperialist countries. The first is the conflict between Britain, the United States, France, and other countries on issues such as stabilizing currency, reducing tariffs, and stabilizing exchange rates. Because the elimination of tariff barriers, the stability of currency, and the abolition of exchange rate restrictions are all economic weapons of the imperialists, and they are all attempting to use them to resist the economic attacks of other countries and eliminate the panic within their own countries!</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this conference is to "restore" prosperity. To "restore" prosperity, it is of course necessary to eliminate the enemy of capitalism: the socialist country, the Soviet Union. Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to discuss how to temporarily ease the contradictions between the various imperialist countries and jointly attack the Soviet Union. Regarding this point, the German fascist financial capitalist's representative Hugenberg's open anti-Soviet statement at the conference is the most obvious evidence.</p>
<p>In short, as a result of this conference, the various imperialist countries may have general and empty agreements on some economic issues in principle, but their main conflicts with each other are still unresolved. In other words, the fundamental shortcomings of capitalism are incurable. Even if there are some partial successes, they are only temporary. Therefore, after this conference, the conflicts between the various imperialist countries will definitely intensify, and the war against the Soviet Union will become more and more urgent.</p>
<p>"No! Only two dollars," he said coldly.</p>
<p>I resentfully grabbed my clothes and walked out. I walked on the sidewalk to the second pawnshop. But just as I was about to step into the entrance of the second pawnshop, the clerk inside was already shaking his hand and saying, "No, no." The third one was the same, the fourth one was the same, and the fifth and sixth ones were still the same. I walked on the road, feeling anxious in my heart. How could the pawnshop, which my poor friends always thought of as a last resort, now refuse to let their nephews enter? I kept walking like this to the ninth one, and fortunately, they didn't refuse to let me in.</p>
<p>"How much will you pawn it for?"</p>
<p>"How much do you say?"</p>
<p>"Three dollars."</p>
<p>"Is ten dollars okay?"</p>
<p>"Where can you get ten dollars for this!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to redeem it!"</p>
<p>"It's useless! Nothing is worth anything these days. Other pawnshops don't want it, but we're still taking it."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because there are too many clothes that haven't been redeemed, and they can't be sold. Everyone is short on money these days. If we take in things that no one redeems, and no one wants to buy them, they'll just be left to rot." The clerk said a lot of business talk.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to pawn the clothes for three dollars. Holding a pawn ticket and three silver dollars in my hand, I wondered what to do. I owed two months of rent, which was five dollars a month, and a month and a half of meal expenses at the boarding place. I had originally wanted to pawn this suit to pay half of it first, but now I only got three dollars. What can that pay for? Thoughts running through my mind, my legs hesitated on the sidewalk, and I didn't dare to go back to see that cold face and vicious sneer.</p>

<h3>W Village in 1926</h3>
<p>— Mingfa</p>
<p>It seemed to be the season of plowing the "upper bank fields," and the atmosphere in W Village suddenly became tense. Many slogans appeared on the yellow mud walls: "Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry!" "Abolish usury!" Children happily sang and walked forward, the marching song of "The future is bright, comrades! Fight!" The old women in the Sanguan Temple who chanted "Amitabha" were also uninterested in chanting scriptures, but gathered next to the ancestral hall to listen to the commotion. The bare-shouldered men in the village were all rubbing their fists and palms, feeling unparalleled excitement. Everything had changed, everything had changed. "We have seen the light of day!" the men all said, raising their heads.</p>
<p>On this day, the main gate of the Wang Clan Ancestral Hall was wide open, and many bare-shouldered men were sitting around tables, drinking tea. Although there were also some people wearing long gowns and mandarin jackets squeezed inside, their numbers were not large. The water vapor from the mouths of the string pots (large copper pots for boiling water, which can burn charcoal inside) depended on the micro-</p>
<h3>A Truthful Account by an Honest Man: A Special Self-Employment Introduction</h3>
<p>— Zheng Chengzi</p>
<p>It was already past five o'clock in the afternoon. I lay in bed, thinking over and over again. My empty stomach always made me helpless, so I had to wrap up a summer suit jacket and go out. When I got to the first pawnshop, they said they didn't want summer clothes. My originally disappointed heart had already decided not to bother asking anymore, but for the sake of filling my stomach, I went to the second one to try my luck. Unexpectedly, this time they actually gave me a dollar! So I took this dollar and went into the dining hall of the College of Law and Politics to buy a meal ticket.</p>
<p>Tonight, the College of Law and Politics was putting on a play, and the theater was also my shabby dining hall. The time for the play was approaching, and many spectators had already gathered there. The theater was unbearably noisy. There was a student showing off, with a very beautiful girl by his side. I knew they were actors or some kind of staff. The student ran around busily, running here and there, asking this and that, looking very busy. At first, I saw him wearing white serge trousers and a black suit jacket, but then I saw him wearing a complete white serge suit, top and bottom.</p>
<p>Before me was such a flamboyant student, and in contrast to me, who had to pawn my clothes to have food, my mood goes without saying. But precisely because of this contrast, I made up my mind to write this article to find a job through the power of words. I am capable of nothing, but if there is any place that can use me, I am confident that I still have a good grasp of it. I have done several things, and written many essays and short commentaries. These things are scattered in various newspapers and magazines, so if there is any work like proofreading, it is even more welcome! Correspondence address: this journal. The agitation of the wind constantly filled the hall, as if telling people that the change in quantity must inevitably turn to a change in quality when it reaches a certain period. The conversation began. What could be vaguely heard amidst the noise was:</p>
<p>"The issue we want to discuss today is how to reorganize the farmers' association, and at the same time, we should properly elect several committee members who can write and speak... Now, let's elect the chairman of the assembly first."</p>
<p>"I think it would be best to have Shou Weng. He can write and speak well. Both in terms of qualifications and status, he is worthy of our respect." The bald man in a Ning silk mandarin jacket sitting in the east corner waved his fan and raised his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>"What Chu Weng said is absolutely right. We unanimously agree." The two people next to him echoed in unison, "Yes, yes, but..."</p>
<p>"No! No!" Acheng Ge couldn't bear it at this point. From his bold demeanor, he continued to issue a decisive cry from his thick throat: "The farmers' association must be run by us farmers ourselves, otherwise it's not called a farmers' association. We don't want people in long gowns and mandarin jackets meddling!"</p>
<p>After his words were spoken, the babbling noise in the ancestral hall became even louder; people were banging on the tables and cursing, making a chaotic mess. After a while, Shou Weng stood up and spoke to Acheng Ge: "What you said is wrong! What skills do you have to dare to boast here? Do you know how to read? If you do, write an article for everyone to see."</p>
<p>"Screw your mother! What's so rare about knowing how to read! Without us farmers, who would you write articles for! You'd starve to death! You can 'write an article,' and I can 'carry a load.' Let's exchange jobs! Can you work in the fields?"</p>
<p>"Good, good, excellent! Excellent! Let's strip off his clothes and call him to taste the flavor of the fields." Eighty or ninety men laughed together, straightened their shoulders, and clapped their hands.</p>
<p>The evening smoke in the village gradually shot into the Wang Clan Ancestral Hall. Everyone felt that it was time for dinner, so they simply concluded the meeting:</p>
<p>"Support Acheng Ge! Down with the local tyrants and evil gentry!"</p>

<h3>A "Poor Man's Library" Appears</h3>
<p>— Wang Liangcai</p>
<p>| No Security Deposit Required for Borrowing Books | In today's society, everything has become commodified, and education is naturally no exception. Therefore, only the children of wealthy families have the opportunity to enjoy a full education, while the poor are mostly abandoned outside the door of education. However, in this era, the tide of the times deeply stimulates us, making us uneasy with our daily lives, and we all need to improve our understanding and grasp of the outside world to prepare for our practice. Because theory without practice is certainly dead, and practice without theory is prone to blind action. Therefore, people's desire for knowledge is not reduced as a result, but rather increases day by day, especially for us shop assistants and apprentices. Whether it is to strive for our own interests or to obtain the welfare of all mankind, we need to seek a large amount of knowledge.</p>
<p>We shop assistants and apprentices are naturally bound by our adverse circumstances, without any freedom. We have to work for more than ten hours every day, and the wages we receive are not even enough for our minimum living expenses. Naturally, there is no question of going to any school, or even a commercial night school, because these schools are also set up for profit, and the tuition fee is at least three to five dollars per month. We certainly do not have this kind of power, but according to the above, we have to seek knowledge, so we can only take the path of self-study. However, self-study is not easy. It goes without saying that we should have a way to self-study. Just the item of books alone becomes a problem, because at present, in addition to newspapers, obtaining books requires a high price. We only need to look at the recent years. Because bookstore owners want to obtain a large amount of profit, they do not hesitate to increase the price of books. Therefore, the price of books has been greatly increased, and books are very expensive.</p>

The Jianhua Agricultural Society needs two farmers, who are provided with food and lodging and a monthly salary of 6 yuan. Must have a guarantor. )Qiafei Road Mingdeli No. 19 China Celebrity Yearbook Society. )</p>
<p>A certain company plans to recruit multiple salespersons, regardless of gender or age, to specialize in door-to-door sales on various roads (large wholesale is also possible). Contact Mr. Che, Yisheng Public Company, Baoshanli, Qipan Street, Wuma Road.</p>
<p>Although there are many library books in Shanghai for us to read, which of these libraries can live up to its name? Are most of the books stored in them old antiques? Not only can they not meet our needs, but they also require a security deposit, handling fee, and limited time. Very few can perfectly suit our needs.</p>
<p>Now it is good. I have discovered a library set up for readers from the news in various newspapers last time. This is the Ant Library established by the Ant Society. According to my investigation, the Ant Society is a group dedicated to cultural activities. In view of the difficulty for young people to study today, it has specially established this library to collect various beneficial books, whether they are profound or superficial, for research or for practical use, literary, social science, natural science... Almost everything is available, and with the spirit of human mutual assistance and absolute trust, it uses the method of borrowing and returning by correspondence, so that those who are interested in reading and are troubled by economic and other problems, whether they are members of the society or not, can borrow and read books freely without leaving their residences or interfering with their work without paying rent or security deposit. In other words, without spending a penny, you can get books to read very conveniently. When the library was established, there were only more than 700 books. Later, through the efforts of the society members, a large-scale solicitation was launched. In less than two months, it expanded to more than 2,000 books and is still continuing to expand. We only need to enclose postage of 7 cents to No. 304 Beijing Road in this city or Post Office Box 2064, and the society will immediately send us a catalog, so we no longer have to worry about not having suitable books to read. In recent months, borrowers have been all over the country, and an average of more than 600 books are borrowed each month, and it is increasing day by day, and the future is limitless!</p>
<p>Because I have started to be a regular customer of the library and have benefited a lot, I dare not remain silent and selfish, and I am happy to introduce it to all our shop assistants and apprentices in Shanghai, so that our shop assistants and apprentices can enjoy the benefits given to us by the library. I hope that our shop assistants and apprentices will enthusiastically borrow books from the library, and at the same time, I hope that everyone will regard the library as our own library and make every effort to maintain it, so that it can be better developed and become a good tool for us to seek knowledge.</p>

<h3>"Morning in the Metropolis"</h3>
<p>— Songzan Da Jun Madam</p>
<p>In order to do important things, I had to get up early. The coal stove was cold, so there was no hot water, but fortunately it was already hot, so I used cold water! A</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>After a flurry of activity, a pot of cold water was used to wash away the dirt from my face, hands, and mouth.</p>
<p>I went out at half past five. Waves of woody fragrance drilled straight into my nostrils. There were many chamber pots, some lacquered, some red lacquered, some black lacquered, some white porcelain, some combining Chinese and Western styles, some mixing Chinese and Western, with different styles and sizes, displayed on both sides of the lane. A dazzling array, beautiful and beyond compare, what a treasure competition!</p>
<p>On West Gate Street, more than a dozen rickshaws were advancing in a long snake formation, with broad beans, amaranth, yellow croaker, squid, etc., piled full in baskets and crates on the footrests and seat cushions of each car. Where are the people? But they perched high on the roof of the car, tottering, quite interesting! I really admire them. One is bold enough to sit, and the other is generous enough to pull.</p>
<p>I waited at the tram stop for twenty minutes, but the short-lived Route 5 tram had not yet arrived. Fearing that I would be late, I had to follow the</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of the goods, I was pulled forward by a rickshaw. After passing the Little North Gate, crossing the French Concession, and entering the British Concession, there were mounds of garbage resembling earthen graves along the road, scattered in piles every three steps and clumps every five steps, covering both sides of the asphalt road. When young masters and misses walk slowly on the smooth and flat road, they will certainly not think that the most wretched garbage has already taken the lead!</p>
<p>Nanjing Road has arrived. It is so quiet! If it weren't for the high and pointed roofs of the three major companies standing in the air, I would almost forget that this is the central point of the bustling Nanjing Road. There are no consumers such as young men in suits and young women, only the workers in short clothes and light clothes, for the sake of life, preparing their blood and flesh to be squeezed by capitalists.</p>
<p>I jumped on the Route 1 tram and drove straight to Jing'an Temple. There were only a few people in the car. Did they have important things like me?</p>
<p>The morning in the metropolis is a collection place for filth, but it is also the active time for great laborers. In the air without foul smells, the morning is much fresher than the daytime; it is far better than the wine-green and neon-lit nights that numb people's minds! In any case, the morning is always more lovely than other times, I think.</p>
<h3>Special Announcement from this Journal</h3>
<p>This journal plans to publish a "Comfortable Nest Life Special Issue" soon. We hope that friends from all walks of life will actively contribute articles. All articles describing life that is absolutely opposite to slums, such as foreign houses, cars, grand hotels, grand restaurants, grand theaters, the human flesh market for the upper class, wealthy families in rural areas, and other types of life that are obsessed with money and extravagance, are welcome! Remuneration is generous.</p>

<h3>A Corner of Filth</h3>
<p>— Xiaohai</p>
<p>The mud of broken ships (the area where the French Concession borders Lujiawan is becoming more and more smelly with the heat of the weather. The ink-black, thick filth is fermenting, with bubbles rising like boiling porridge here and there. There are many broken ships in the mud, I don't know which year they fell into it.</p>
<p>The power plant is rumbling day and night. The river bank is full of rickshaws, so it is also attracting the business of rickshaw pullers; cold noodle stalls, rice stalls, sesame cake stoves...everything is available, and you can often hear "White sugar plums! One copper coin for one..." "Hey, do you want to eat Longdi pears? Sliced Longdi pears!..." sounds of that kind, and the stench surrounds a broken ship and the objects inside it. Sickness and hunger follow them. Each of them carries a bronze-like complexion, using their physiological instincts to develop the power to adapt to this unfortunate environment. They are used to living there.</p>
<p>Let him go, but he has to live on! These people who have no "land".</p>
<p>"Uncle Li, things are already quite bad... What you said, ah, is it true?" Zhang San said, looking a little worried. Uncle Li didn't have any solution either.</p>
<p>"Yes, Uncle Li, yes, where can we move to at this time? ... To put it bluntly, we've lived here for three years, ... Xiao Wuzi's father is also really..." Sister-in-law San interrupted.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law San, hey, this year, ... there's nothing to say!" Uncle Li scratched his scalp and sighed.</p>
<p>The stench rushed in, the broken ship was as stuffy as a steamer, and one or two lines of sunlight came in through the seams of the awning. "They said these broken ships are "ugly", but they didn't say whether we should live or not, right? Uncle Li."</p>
<p>"What..."</p>
<p>A voice floated nearby, sounding a lot like Xiao Wuzi's.</p>
<p>"Mom, look, he's robbing me..."</p>
<p>Everyone squeezed out of the cabin. At this time, Xiao Wuzi was wearing half a basket of coal cinder and wrestling with someone. His opponent was about the same size. They fought, fought, fought, and then "thump"! Xiao Wuzi rolled into the mud. The other child saw it...it wasn't right! Immediately picked up his feet and ran away.</p>
<p>"Oh dear!..." Uncle Li was shouting, dragging a voice that blamed the child.</p>
<p>"Mom!..."</p>
<p>"You motherfucker! I told you to pick up coal cinder, why are you fighting with people? I'll beat you to death, a son of a bitch!" The old man Zhang San blinked his eyes and watched indifferently while scolding.</p>
<p>Xiao Wuzi got up, and his lower body became a</p>
<p>"Mud loach", still shouting.</p>
<p>"You unmothered thing! Hurry up and live your mother's skin, you're still fighting, you still have the leisure to fight, do you know you have to eat, you have to have a place to live? ... You motherfucker! You know where you're going to live in three days! You motherfucker..." Zhang San's sister-in-law hit Xiao Wuzi twice on the back.</p>
<p>So, they started talking about the move again. "Hey, you think, Uncle Li, right? Isn't the time too short? Three days..."</p>
<p>"Yes, Sister-in-law San, don't worry, right. This is everyone's business, it's not just asking your family to move, right!..."</p>
<p>"That's what you say, Uncle Li, but don't you think three days is too short?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to inquire and see if there's any better news, maybe the higher-ups will be more lenient..."</p>
<p>"That would be great. You think, right, Xiao Wuzi's father doesn't run around the city much either. If there's any news, hey, please Uncle Li give us a message, okay!"</p>
<p>"That's natural. Okay, I'm leaving, don't be anxious, right."</p>
<p>Xiao Wuzi was washing his body. Zhang San and his wife saw Uncle Li out, and Uncle Li left leisurely. The two of them put all their hope on Uncle Li, waiting to see what he would say next time.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! ... Three days, where are we going to move?" Zhang San was still talking to himself.</p>
