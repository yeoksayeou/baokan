<h3>國聯决定不承認原則後日本仍竭全力圖和解</h3>
<p>杉村再向德魯蒙求援手</p>
<p>九人起草會改今晨開會</p>
<p>美國表示遠東政策不變</p>
<p>但聲明不干涉國聯工作</p>
<p>日内瓦　今日無任何會議、九人起起草會改明晨開會、國聯秘書長德魯蒙徇副秘書長日人杉村之要求、故意予日本使用嘗試政策之機會、日本雖對建議草案極端不滿、但仍一兩提出可笑之提議、企圖阻撓延宕國聯之進行　日人狡計之獲售、顯得德魯蒙之助力不少云、（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）外交界息、十九國委員會一致不承認僞組織、並不與合作、外交界對此認爲極關重要、並未表示滿意、因國聯如欲主持公道、必須如此規定也、但此項報告將來提出大會後、是否不生變化、尙難預斷、即順利通過、將來對日之無理反對、又將如何制裁、亦難推測、故不因此而抱樂觀、仍隨時注意時局之發展、堅持我固定之主張、（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本代表團經由國聯會日本事務局長杉村、向國聯會遞送日本政府關於提付非常大會報告書之最後建議、此項建議當即轉送十九國委員會、其内容與從前所提出者相差無幾、係承自李頓報告書「恢復原狀并非解决辦法」各語、謂「局勢以現狀爲起點、當可改善、而不致發生糾紛」云云、起草委員會原定本日開會、俾以十九國委員會昨日所决定之原則爲基礎、而開始起草最後建議案、現已决定延緩二十四小時、至延緩開會原因、僅由於國聯會秘書處製作草案稿以爲起草委員會工作之基礎、迄今尙未竣事、别無其他理由、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）九人小組會今日不集議、定明晨開會、故數方面所抱建議案起草工作今日可畢之希望、末能實現、蓋不獨秘書處今日不及完成其草案、且有理由可信日本最近提議現方在幕後積極討論中也、國聯與日本之皆不願决裂、於此可見、雙方意見相差之度、在比較上並不甚遠、故目前尙有覓取雙方所可滿意的方案、俾盟約第十五條第三節下調解手續得以進行之可能性、國聯大會將於數日後開會、在今後數日内時局將見分曉、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>建議原則六項</h3>
<p>不承認僞滿國</p>
<p>制裁未定辦法</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今日作重要討論後、一致議定指導九人委員會　起草建議工作之原則如下、㈠李頓報告書第十章所載之十原則、須取爲草案之根據、草案須守國聯盟約非戰公約及九國公約之範圍、㈡「滿洲國」之維持、不能視爲解决方法、現有政治制度、必不可予以在認、㈢滿洲現有之政法制度、未具有可使人承認之資格、㈣全體會員國必須團結行動、㈤必須有不承認之若干原則、以作不承認决議之後援、庶不致因領事等駐於滿洲等事而起之必要的事實之承認、變爲等於法律上承認之事件、㈥須覓取非會員國之合作、尤其是鄰邦與九國公約簽字國、以上六點、爲會衆表示同意之一般基礎、尙有一事、衆所認爲須予解决者、爲兩造任何一方不實行建議的解决法時、國聯應有何種手續之重要問題、此事甚不易辦、瑞士代表摩太以暢直堅强之言詞勸告會衆、考慮盟約第十六條之制裁辦法、但會衆不以此議爲然、咸以爲建議案旣已展開、則關於將來潛能性之局勢、自可不言而喻、會塲中一般意見似皆欲維持一種委員會、瑞典代表提出除不與「滿洲國」合作外、各國應否通過議案、决定在日本仍佔據滿洲時不與日政府合作、並限定滿洲日軍撤退時期之問題、但會衆對比問題未加贊助、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>杉村訪德魯蒙</h3>
<p>新妥協案再度接洽</p>
<p>（日内瓦）杉村次長七日上午十時訪問特魯蒙秘書長、正式提交日本提案、並說明日政府之立塲、特魯蒙對杉村言明、彼將於十日十九國委員會提交日本提案、詢問委員會對此意見、兩人會見經四十分後完畢、（七日日聯社電）</p>
<p>日内瓦　日代表團六日下午五時接到本國政府之訓令、七時召開代表會議、審議新作戰計劃之結果、决定於明日派杉村事務次長會見特魯蒙事務總長、照政府新訓令再行開始交涉、日代表團决定方針、盡力進行第三項之和解手續、至最後地步爲止、然十九國委員會若在交涉和解手續之時、仍照六日會議所决定之反日態度拒絶日本提案、則立即停止第三項之折衝行動、而採取最後手段、（七日日聯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）内田外相於昨午後已發回訓於松岡全權、並聲明新方式爲帝國政府之最終案、不許再有讓步的變更、尤其關於「滿洲國」主權之條項、不許對日本之承認發生疑惑、或使之　昩、若十九國委員會不承認新方式、致令和解失敗、帝國政府不負其責、最後復加入『帝國政府對適用第四項時、已早有準備、此層早在貴代表洞鑑之中』等語、（七日電通社電）</p>

<p>（東京）日皇侍從長鈴木大將昨日代表重臣意見、訪西園寺公爵、磋商對國聯應取之最高國策、軍部聞訊甚形狼狽、恐軍閥之侵略政策被重臣推翻、荒木陸長今日下午特訪鈴木大將、說明東三省現情、謂日本不取强硬政策、東省勢必被俄國赤化、東三省赤化則與日本存亡有關、處此危局若退讓則日本不能自存、故望重臣維持陸軍之武力政策對付國聯、求鈴木代爲疏解、國際政局在千鈞一髮之今日、日軍部竟盡死力壓迫一切之反對勢力、軍閥最後示威、其結果誠堪注目、（七日華聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之狂暴　晦</h3>
<p>（一）國聯愈敷衍日本愈發狂</p>
<p>九一八事件提交國聯公斷以來。雖曾一再决議。其結果所謂道德裁判。口頭公道亦僅捷克。瑞士。哀爾蘭等小國所主張。其左右國際聯盟實際行動之大國并口惠而無之。事實則僅有延宕。任日本帝國主義之肆意擴大其侵略。每當我國提出一次新要求裁制日本之暴力時。國際聯盟即敷衍一次。多一次不關痛癢。不足輕重之討論。然而我國人民即因此更增加一重痛苦。失陷土地。亦更見擴張。現且侵入山海關。延至熱河矣。準此非但所謂「滿洲傀儡旣成事實。自山海關至於朝陽寺又將成爲新的另一事變。我國之土地有限。日本所欲製造之新事實無窮。蠶食之禍。豈祈禱公理之助力所能苟免。</p>
<p>十九國委員對中日糾紛之討論。現又告一段落。『第一將根據李頓報告書第九·第十兩章。（中國未有主權之名。而有斷送東北之實。）認回復滿洲原狀爲不可能。但維持中國在滿洲之主權。第二反對在法律上在事實上承認滿洲國。第三嚴格遵守國聯盟約。非戰公約。及九國公約等三項國際條約。』但瀋陽事變迄今一年又五個月。李頓報告書發表亦四月有奇。中國主權依然爲敵人鐵騎所蹂躪。「滿洲」原狀果未回復。至於非戰公約已爲日本軍隊在東北三省之暴行。上海之焚殺。榆關之轟炸等等事變所撕毁。國聯盟約。九國公約亦同爲鐵蹄下之廢紙。</p>
<p>尤有甚者。日本政府竟公然强制國聯承認其一手所製造之事實丨丨「滿洲（傀儡）國。」否則即以退出國聯相威脅。吾人於憤慨自勵之餘。對於國聯遇事遷就。不能不深致惋惜。對日本政府猶可謂之爲軍部工具。當以軍閥之意旨爲規範。殊知日本金融資本家乃與軍閥行爲如出一轍。東京金融。產業商業界領袖羣集討論如何應付日内瓦（國聯）抑制日本問題。其間最滑稽者莫如橫濱正金銀行總理兒玉謙次發言以爲『無論何種建議。日人祇說「知道了」答覆他。不必有什麽切實行動···經濟封鎖不成問題。法日關係良好。不致於因爲國聯行動而起妨害。美國大槪和從前一樣。不致於有什麽舉動。以增加日美間問題的嚴重。美國的排日也不會發生。史汀生政策。事實上不會有什麽成就。·····』其狂態爲何如乎。由此證明國際聯盟愈遷就日本所謂之事實。而日本愈加狂暴。等國聯於無物矣。</p>
<p>（二）經濟封鎖果不成問題乎</p>
<p>然則。日本果不畏經濟封鎖乎。日本號稱大國。而其國内鐵鑛之埋藏僅及一萬萬噸。煤之埋藏不僅八十萬萬噸。煤汕埋藏台灣在内亦僅十二萬萬樽。僅此區區豈能支配亞東。雄飛世界。然自侵略東北以來。　括三省富源。自以爲從此可以支配中國。威脅英美。制　太平洋也。殊不知實際事實固不如是簡單。其國内之困難。亦因侵略之發展而擴大。一般社會亦因軍事勢力之膨脹而展開其矛盾現象焉。</p>
<p>吾人試舉本年度預算不足塡補公債而論。其歲收不足之塡補公債六萬萬六千萬日金。滿洲事變公債一萬萬八千六百萬日金。及其他如電話。震災。道路。與夫朝鮮。台灣。關東庫頁島等。特别會計所發公債。合計九萬萬八千八百萬日金。加以去年度未發行之公債尙有九萬萬日金。總計日本公債額數在本年底當有八十萬萬。現時其財部透支及臨時抵借約及六萬萬圓日金。是故日本國家負債算至本年年終將在八十六萬萬圓日金以上。而外債在匯兌上之損失尙不在内。以此轉嫁諸日本國民。每人平均將及一百五十圓。即令遍及於台灣朝鮮使殖民地民族同其負擔。則每人所負國債之數亦不下百圓日金。再加以農村個人負債總數七十萬萬圓。日本人民其何以自活。</p>
<p>近數年來。日本發行公債逐年增加。且所謂國債之全部皆爲不生產之公債。在財政上。未來之日本將永刧陷於收入减少之一途而無法可以自拔。今後利息支出亦達五萬萬圓日金。外債十四萬萬八千萬圓日金。僅以額面而論亦須支付利息八千萬圓再加匯兌低落。之損耗則又當增加八千萬以至一萬萬圓矣。以租稅全部支付公債利息猶恐不足。而軍事費之急劇膨脹更使日本債台高築也。據此區區一端公債增大之結果。日本能不畏經濟封鎖乎。我國人處此狂暴的侵略之下。値敵將自潰之際。其何以自救。</p>
<h3>美國國力之槪觀（華盛頓通信）</h3>
<p>美國以其地大物博、適當立國於自由主義勃興之際、努力開發之結果、生產事業、蒸蒸日上、歐洲大戰、美國以甚少之犧牲而獲得甚大之利益、大戰以後、美國遂一躍而代不列顚帝國執世界經濟牛耳、利用其金圓勢力、縱橫捭闓於國際壇坫者垂十餘年、最近雖以經濟恐慌之狂潮、震撼全世界、美國產業、亦日以即於凋敝、然彼雄厚之國富、要仍非其他國家、所可望其項背、</p>
<p>（主要產物）美國東西海岸雖有山脈、但其間大河交流、大平原中、蘊藏有極豐富之物產、儘量發揮其生產力、此爲其得天獨厚之一點、茲將美國重要產物、略述於次、㈠鑛產、美國大宗鑛產、爲銅·銑鐵·煤等、約佔全世界產額二分之一、石油產量、佔世界總產量約七成、鹽類等食料品中、工業原料亦有七百七十萬噸、（世界總產額、銅百九十萬噸、銑鐵九千八百萬噸、煤十三億九千萬噸、石油等三億六百萬噸、工業原料三千八百萬噸、㈡食品、米之出產、不及我國、小麥出產、則佔世界總產額五分之一、（世界總產額一億五千七百萬基羅、）㈢織物、棉花、世界產額五百八十萬噸之中、三百二十萬號爲美國出產、絲繭及羊毛、則不及日本、上述農產物、雖有多種不及他國、但現代工業之基礎的原料、軍需工業基礎原料之鐵與石油煤等、則凌駕各國、幾有獨佔之勢、</p>
<p>（經濟原因）美國民族、其組合成分、極爲複雜、乃由白人·黑人·及其他各有色人種混合而成、又以一切皆從新建造、無何種因襲的舊勢力與舊制度爲其束縛、故其民族、無往而不充滿活潑前進之氣象、此種無形之國力、確値吾人特别注意、關於美國社會經濟形態之形成及其特點、前年曾有人爲詳細之調查、列舉有以下八點、㈠天然資源、尤其在大規模產業原料資源上、遠較他國豐富、爲石油·煤·鐵等、皆有極富之蘊藏量、㈡工人缺乏、工資昂貴、富源膨大、浪費頗多、故生活程度、較各國爲特高、㈢因富源膨大工人缺乏、遂促使增長農業工業及運輸上之機械運用、以節勞力、因而一般勞工生活、普遍向上、㈣本國市塲廣大、消費生產、頗能保持平衡、㈤事業之經營及組織力之充分的發揮、如科學管理、即其一例、㈥勞資雙方、甚爲協調、產業機關、行動極爲圓滑、㈦事業家恒將自身問題公開於社會、委諸會議或研究之手、以謀經營上之進步、㈧樂天的努力之特性、橫溢於經濟界、新天地雖已無開拓餘地、但各人之行動、仍極積極、常係向上的、</p>
<p>（國富槪要）美國國富、究至若何程度、可觀下表、</p>
<p>各國國富比較表</p>
<p>國别　　年份　　國富額（單位百萬圓）　人口每名（單位圓）美國　一九二五年　七六二、三五六　　　六、六○七英國　一九二五年　二、三六、三三○　　五、二四七蘇聯　一九二四年　一○四、一○二　　　七五六法國　一九二五年　一○三、五二○　　　二、五四九日本　一九二四年　一○二、三四二　　　一、七三一德國　一九二四年　七一、六八五　　　　一、一四一意大利二九二四年　四四、七三八　　　　一、一、一七</p>
<p>調查方法、各國不同、上述統計、不過聊示大體而已、而且嚴格言之、所謂國富、並不能僅就數字上觀察、蓋因財富之運用不同、同等數量之財產、可得逈不相同之兩種結果、而美國對於財富之運用、尤恰爲最爲活躍、故其實際國力、實還在數字所示以上、美國有一學者、曾謂美國經濟勢力、雖其五分之二、須歸諸富源、五分之三、則應歸之優秀的運用效率、故美國若一旦有事、即能極迅速的正確的有組織的產業動員、且可有相當之耐久性、此從世界大戰時可以見之、此外尙有二百億之對外債權、尙不在内、</p>
<p>（農業生產）美國現在固然已經成爲工業國、但實際上仍是一大農業國家、其農作之豐歉、恒足影響及於全國經濟、美國自己國内有極大之市塲、生產不必傾銷國外、仍可在國内行銷、其輸出實不過全生產之一部份而已、故若將美國封鎖、其自國内仍可自給自足、不必仰給國外、此爲美國一優點、美國之財富、在僅在其數字上、而在其運用財富之力量上、此點前已言之、故美國之生產、幾無一不爲大規模的、即如農田耕植一項而論、牽引機數量之鉅大、除蘇聯外、無可與匹敵者、因有此大量生產、故物價低廉、物價低廉、銷路遂廣、</p>
<p>（人民能力）美國之發明力、吾人亦殊不能漠視、愛迪生之電燈、與及影戲·留聲機·播音機等、無一非來自美國、其他日常活生之發明、美國人亦有甚大之貢獻、美國政論家謙士氏曾言、自一七八四年至一九二七年中、世界上可以稱爲大發明者、有四十八件、在各種機械發明中、如電話·製紙機·飛機·電視等、而發明家美國則佔去三十八人、英國六人、德法各四人、從可覘知美人之優秀、而此等機械之發明、則又無一不與經濟發生直接關係、即無一不與其國力有關、</p>
<p>不寗淮是、美國人之組織力、亦常在各國之上、如大戰時、聯邦準備銀行制度、即其一例、其餘如企業上之科學管理與產業合理化等、亦無一不發生或發源於美國、美國旣爲一金圓國家、其人民觀念、大都偏重功利實用、故美人常謂與其研究深奥之科學、不如養成立即有用之科學、即可見其國民性之一般、總之、美國爲一金圓國家、故處處有其金圓氣息、今雖以世界之不况、而漸呈衰替、但其雄厚之財力、固仍足左右一世焉、（一月十日）</p>
<h3>日報載美實業家排日貨</h3>

<h3>美國海軍演習太平洋大戰</h3>
<p>戰事進行至防守海岸一幕</p>
<p>國民社六日舊金山電　美海軍春操、現已進行至演習太平洋濱防守一幕、今日將有假定敵艦進攻自墨西一哥至阿拉斯加間之海岸、此項假定敵艦、即日前進攻檀香山者、以巡洋艦與驅逐艦爲主力、携飛機甚衆、此時假定已將珠港要塞、完全燬滅、深入襲攻美國太平洋濱、防守艦隊則以戰鬥艦爲主力、大部份集中於加里福尼亞海濱、巴拿馬運河地帶、僅留數艦駐防、軍力單薄、比較易於攻占、蓋預定敵人將襲攻加里福尼亞海濱、故以主力集中其地、惟敵艦所在、迄今猶未發見云、</p>

<p>軍縮會中一霹靂</p>
<h3>蘇俄外長力主明定侵略界說</h3>
<p>駁斥實行侵略種種荒謬理由</p>
<p>國際監視機關始爲人所信任</p>
<p>路透六日日内瓦電　軍縮會總委員會今日開會時、俄外交委員李維諾夫發言、謂必國家自由之憲章公佈於世、而說明之、然後廢戰之國際協定始可有眞意味、法國軍縮計畫僅第一節涉及世界各國、渠準備簽字於載有此種提議之公約、但託詞侵略之已往事件、世人已熟聞之、今必須先定侵略之界說、而將藉以實行侵略之種種荒謬理由駁斥無遺、然後將來國際監視機關方可具有權力、表示公道、而爲人所信任云、李維諾夫提出說明「侵略國」名詞之宣言草案、凡首先宣戰者、或不宣戰而侵入或攻擊他國土地者、皆爲侵略國、李氏並稱、稍緩渠將提議列强對於非戰公約、曾提出保留案者、必須正式放棄其保留、李氏於討論「侵略」意義之伸縮性時、謂近來似有一種趨勢、以爲甲國藉口乙國國内不靖、或藉口在乙國有投資關係、或特殊利益、或藉口乙國缺少某種資格、或藉口軍略上理由、或欲擴張其防線於自己國境之外、即可攻擊乙國、此種理論、近日已有人提出、而視戰爭爲保障和平之方法、要知此種理論、國際公斷員苟默認之、則武裝衝突中將永無所謂侵略國矣云、</p>
<h3>開始討論法國計劃</h3>
<p>國民社七日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議總委員會討論法國軍縮安全計劃時、波蘭·西班牙·蘇俄之代表、均曾發言、波蘭代表雖贊成其原則、但對於該計劃能否在今日實施、抱懷疑態度、西班牙代表抨擊法國之建議甚力、蘇俄代表李惟諾夫則提議規定戰爭中侵略國之界說、即國家首先宣戰或先行攻入外國境内或封鎖對方海濱之國李氏繼又發揮其意見、謂於規定之時期内、實行完全軍縮、實爲解决全問題唯一利便方法云、</p>
<h3>日本議會討論外交問題</h3>
<p>又在竭力拉攏美國</p>
<p>路透七日東京電　衆院預算委員會開會時、曾討論日本外交問題、當時有人詢及中俄對滿洲問題彼此親善之影響、尤其及於中東鐵路與松花江航務者、外相内田答稱、中俄之復交、迄今尙未發生不良之影響外相續答其他問話、謂日本現與美國密切接近、以謀彼此諒解、此舉駐華盛頓大使出淵當力能爲之、有謂大西洋美國艦隊現集於太平洋、不足有助遠東之和平與治安者、外相對於此言、不願發表任何意見、繼又有人詢及政府關於中日恢復尋常關係之政策者、外相答稱、兩國間友好與合作的關係、實爲維持遠東和平與治安所必要、惟操切行事、諸多不便、故日本對華應採行忍耐政策云、藏相高橋繼外相答覆問話、謂政府不欲增收所得稅、惟藏相承認徵收產業稅、現正在私議中、有問政府擬用何法管理匯兌者、藏相答稱、政府不欲限制匯率、政府此舉、志在防杜因投機活動引起之不規則的漲落、但因時令與商業需求所發生之漲落、將聽其自然、不加過問云、</p>
<h3>法政府通過預算案</h3>
<p>提交衆院討論</p>
<p>國民社七日巴黎電　新政府之預算計劃、已於今日午後在國會提出、規定將國用短少之數减去五、五○○、○○○、○○○佛郎、其中二、四○○、○○○、○○○佛郎、乃由撙節各用所致、削减文職官俸亦其　也、另將以新稅等法徵集一、三○○、○○○、○○○佛郎、而不使納稅人受有影響、但達拉第内閣、現仍在兩可間、至在國會財政辯論中可佔勝利之希望、衆皆以爲甚微云、</p>
<p>路透六日巴黎電　政府之財政建議、已於今日由閣議一致通過、明日即將由衆議院之財政委員會提出報告、衆議院或將於二月十一日提出討論、據新政府之計算、預算不足之數爲五五○○○○○○○○法郎、並非如前財政薛隆所云之一·○○○○○○·○○○法郎云、聞預算不足之數、將採取緊縮及增加稅率政策以爲彌補之策云、</p>
<h3>美國共和黨起分化</h3>
<p>改組或分立進步黨</p>
<p>國民六日華盛頓電　法萊氏刻正與羅斯福商榷、以若干重要位置、畀共和黨内進步派人物、藉促該黨之分化、而共和黨領袖、則正討論循依較自由之途徑改組本黨、聞法萊之謀頗引爲大感、深恐一旦實現後、共和黨内舊派與進步派之裂痕、將無法消弭、惟共和黨人、亦非完全贊成改組、僅其領袖數人、尤其參院商務委員會主席顧存士、作此主張、據聞顧氏願出私財充改組經費、今日又聞共和黨領袖多人、擬乘法萊商定其名單以前、先將改組問題、在黨内獲一諒解、否則克丁·强生·諾利士·與拉福萊特諸人、已表示將加入分設進步黨運動、恐一旦經法萊餌以要職後、不復能留在共和黨内也、</p>
<h3>正式宣告羅斯福當選</h3>
<p>國民七日華盛頓電　美國參衆兩院將於明日在衆院開聯席會議、由參議長依法正式宣告羅斯福當選爲美國大總統、美國正副新總統雖已於去年十一月間初選後决定、顧其時選出者猶屬初選當選人、其名額等於各州所出參衆議員之數、迨一月第　星期三、此項初選當選人即集合於本州首邑、舉行複選、由各州州長將複選票封送國務院、於是國務卿彙合各州複選票、於明日送交國會、行最後檢票揭示手續、惟初選當選人所投之票、當然爲本黨候選正副總統、故複選票數在初選揭曉後、即可斷定、此次民主當贏得四十二州、羅斯福可得複選票四日七十二張、共和黨僅贏得六州、胡佛僅可得五十九張、副總統之複選票亦如之、又初選時兩黨票數、民主黨得二二、八一三、七八六票、共和黨得一五、七五九、二六六票、此種大勝大敗、在美國總統選舉史上、尙屬創見云、</p>
<h3>聯席會議紀念柯立芝</h3>

<h3>埃烏懷州農村亦破產</h3>
<p>國民社六日台莫亞尼（埃烏懷州）電　美國埃烏懷州農民、因抵押之田產、將遭債權人没收、加以農產品慘跌、正有完全破產之虞、今日羣起要求本州立法議會、立予救濟、否則將以强力解散議會、自選新議會、據此間所接消息、美國中西部農區全體農民、刻正團結一致防阻抵押品之没收抬賣、所有債權人派往之代表及收賬員　皆無力行使職務、日多被以强力拒絶入境、至埃烏懷農民之要求、係經農民停糶協會向議會請願、并聲稱若不俯順其請、勢將非至全州流血不止、至農民停糶協會是係提倡停糶運動機關、其目的在勸告各農民在獲得救濟以前、儲糧勿糶、其宣傳員公然承認、最後將馴至農民總罷耕、聞此種運動、在去夏僅有埃烏懷州多數農民加入、範圍不大、並以指導無方、至秋間即行放棄、今則已有許多大田主加入、其勢力已日見雄厚云、</p>
<h3>德國施行鐵腕政治</h3>
<p>緊急命令推翻法院判决</p>
<p>幕後進行修改憲法計劃</p>
<p>國民社六日柏林電　今日總統以斷然手段、頒布緊急命令、將德國最高法院關於普魯士邦憲法爭執案之判决、一筆勾銷、其理由爲該項判决、於普邦之公衆利益有碍、故不能成立、並將前法院判决普魯士政府所應保留之種種特權、頒給普魯士邦中央特派行政員、普邦中央特派行政員巴本氏、已受命實施該項命令、</p>
<p>今日總統命令之副署者、亦爲巴本氏、緣總總理已因選舉運動、前往慕尼黑、故由副總理巴本代署云、自此命令頒布之後、普邦原有之三人委員會、遂呈停頓之現象、因巴本已取普邦總理白朗之位而代之、此外則普邦議會之主席喀爾氏、亦屬國社黨人物、唯第三者爲亞登諾爾氏、彼爲中央黨人特、故反對此緊急命令甚力、認爲違背魏馬憲法之舉、不允許參加三人會議、因此巴本與喀爾二人、已决定於三月四日解散普邦議會、而於六日與中央大選舉同時舉行議員之重選、現普邦政府復擬乞靈於最高法院、但將來之效果、恐亦甚微也、</p>
<h3>解散議會憲法問題</h3>
<p>國民六日柏林電　解散普議會之命令、須至三月五日發生効力、但國家社會黨政府、將不准該議會再行集議、各議員此時祇得從事選舉運動、至普政府今已按照命令、完全在國聯邦政府控制之下、而普邦警察、亦完全歸普魯士行政委員戈林節制、今日全國憲法學家、悉受反對黨委託、研究政府此舉、是否符合憲法、蓋據反對黨意見、政府此令與委任普魯士行政院之原令、俱屬違憲、因巴本第一次以聯邦總理兼攝普邦政務時、反對黨曾向最高法院起訴、試騐此舉之法律性質、嗣法庭判斷結果、認爲不合憲法、但政府辯稱、憲法中關於總統對於此事之權力、未嘗明白規定、以故今日毅然打銷法院之判斷、下此新令、目下觀察時局者、咸認政府在解散國會與普議會之幕後、實有修改憲法計畫、蓋巴本與希特勒向來主張修改憲法、尤其對於選舉法、亟欲加以改革、在巴本内閣辭職以前、曾開始向國會接洽某種修改、未得要領、其後歷次選舉結果、業已證明欲謀國會中條改憲法、在實際已屬不可能、據聞現正考慮召集憲法會議、或請全國人民公决二法、就目前形勢逆料、三月間選出之新國會、倘再不能有通過修改憲法之望、大約將直接請國民公决矣、</p>
<h3>嚴厲命令限制自由</h3>
<p>路透六日柏林電　新總理希特勒之鐵治、逐日暴露、頃又發表嚴厲命令、限制報紙之自由、取締煽動總罷工、及似足損害國家利益之虚僞非語、命令中警告凡洩漏軍事秘密者、得便宜懲治之、並稱、報紙因犯各種罪戾、得延長其停刋期限、凡發行人洩漏軍事秘密·煽動作違法行爲或暴烈行爲·侮辱政府官員散播危及國家重要利益之虚僞消息者、其至大之罪罰、爲徒刑一年、並授權地方官禁止集欵以充政治團體之用、普魯士政府决議向來比錫最高法院呈訴解散議會之違法、但法院大約須在三月五日選舉以後始行下判也、共和黨與社會黨團體俱復受打擊、因政府授權内務部長、禁止兩黨黨員衣黨中制服、而彼等之開會游行、非受極嚴密之監視、均不得照准、自希特勒秉權後、國家社會黨與共產黨因彼此衝突而喪生者、已逾三十人、今日柯洛業因國社黨興奮之結果、重傷四人、内有老婦一人、又格拉巴赫里希特有國社黨搗毁猶大人之商店、傷警察兩人、杜斯堡有國社黨黨員一人於執紼時爲一工廠中人狙擊而死、另擊斃共產黨黨員一人、共產黨議員宣稱、内閣擬宣布共產黨之選舉名單爲不合法云、</p>
<h3>英國失業人數增加</h3>

<h3>徐淑希昨演講國際間形勢</h3>
<p>國聯决不輕易容日人毁盟約</p>
<p>與美俄聯合不能以行難自餧</p>
<p>國際問題研究會、於昨日下午五時、在銀行俱樂部開會員大會、請我國國聯代表團秘書徐淑希演講、到陳立廷·穆藕初·鄒秉文·張絅伯·錢新六·吳任之·陳彬龢·朱義農·等十餘人由鄒秉文主席、謂徐淑希先生爲研究東北問題及國際政治之權威學者、此次本其所學、担任國際代表團重要職務、各種在國際問折衝重要之文件、均出其手、即對於今後應有之各種問題、均有充分之準備、此次因公返國、同人除表示歡迎外、并藉得聆徐先生之敎益、次由徐氏演講國際對東北問題之情形、與我國應取之外交策略、講後、復由鄒秉文穆藕初詢以歐洲各國之眞正輿論、與熱河問題、徐氏均有詳細之解答、茲分誌如后、</p>
<h3>東北與國聯</h3>
<p>日本之侵略東北、爲其所行大陸政策必然爆發之一着、試言其與世界各國之關係、則此舉不僅爲欺侮我國、直欺侮全世界、因其所爲、完全違反國際盟約及九國公約非戰公約之規定也、國際聯盟、爲各國鑒於歐戰慘酷之結果而發起、今日在國聯活動諸人、固多目覩歐戰中、死亡千萬人民、與燬損無數財產之慘狀者、决不至輕易熟視日人之一手撕毁盟約而無覩也、二個月來、國人見英法等國袒日態度、而表示絶望、本人歷謂其不若傳說之甚、無庸失望、蓋國聯如通過制裁日本、則首當其衝者爲列强、尤爲英國、以其海軍最大、始能担當此任務、故强國最不願放棄其儘量使用和平手段以免一旦决裂、俾自身感受困難、今日報載日内瓦電、已明白揭示十九國特委會、一致否認僞國、英國之眞正態度、已可槪見、至美國對遠東問題之態度、迄未稍變其『門户開放』『領土完整』二原則之政策、當然無與日諒解之可能、</p>
<h3>中俄同利害</h3>
<p>再進而言蘇聯之關係、則以地勢而論、中俄兩國之利害、幾完全一致、蓋日本併呑東三省後、俄之沿海二州、决不能保全、如日人之勢、侵入蒙古、則並西伯利亞亦無可守之道、在甲午戰後、日人乘戰勝之餘威、逼我國承認朝鮮獨立、及割讓遼東半島時、帝俄執政者、認爲與其無關、未加過問、惟一富有經騐之老外交家、侗識此中利害、乃聯合法德兩國、强迫日本交還遼東半島、至今日威脅蘇俄遠東領土之局勢、益趨緊張、兩國利害、已可謂完全一致、</p>
<h3>中美俄親善</h3>
<p>吾人旣明瞭此國際間形勢、進而言應付之策、在國際方面、我國仍不可放鬆一步、國人近日有主長退出國聯者、實昩於形勢、然吾人亦不宜依賴國聯、於國際應運用外交、以聯美俄兩國、今日中俄已恢復邦交、固可欣慰、然並不能以復交爲已足、應進一步而謀中俄親善、同時并謀中美親善、更進一步而謀中美俄親善、如此、則我國在此困苦之環境中、可以應付裕如矣、</p>
<h3>不能諉行難</h3>
<p>吾爲此語、必有人謂凡事知之易而行之難者、知易行難一語、本與孫中山先生之學說相背、無庸鄙人加以駁詰、即行之果難、秉政而爲國家作久計者、亦不能以此自餧、數十年前、普法戰爭後、法處德國宰制之下、其環境之困苦、數十倍於今日之中國、然法之執政者、努力從事於外交上之聯絡、英法協約、法俄協約、復進而成英俄法三國協約以制德、夫英法爲數百年來之深仇、英俄亦爲百年深仇、然法之外交家、不以其難而束手、何况今中俄中美與美俄間之關係、固尙無若斯之困難乎、</p>
<h3>國際間輿論</h3>
<p>徐氏演講畢、鄒秉文詢以歐美各國對東北問題之眞正輿論、徐氏答謂、國内報紙、均係實在情形、美國方面、自始至終、均主持公道、英國報紙、較爲守舊、且受日本之反宣傳甚深、故以前較爲混亂、自李頓報告書發表後、態度一變、亦講公道話矣、至法國巴黎之報紙、其言論完全商品化、我國外交官署、本身經費、尙感困難、寗復能若日人之收買輿論、故一致袒日、然社會上亦深知法報之價値、不甚注意也、日内瓦有二報紙、一以主筆政者對遠東情形較熟悉、故尙能主持公道、另一爲法文報、亦袒日、</p>
<h3>熱河之重要</h3>
<p>次穆藕初詢以㈠如日人佔領熱河後、是否繼續進佔平津、㈡如日佔熱河後、美俄態度、是否改變、㈢東北倘無義勇軍之奮勇抗日、國際間形勢若何、徐氏答、㈠如日人佔領熱河、平津本爲其目的物、惟視國際間表示、及我軍抵抗之力量爲斷、如我抵抗能力薄弱、日人决然進佔也、㈡美俄態度、須視我國抵抗力量而定、如我不自振作、决不能望他人助我、㈢東北如無義勇軍之抵抗、國際間形勢、當益不利於我、以現在可證明滿洲國之成立、並非出於人民自願、次徐氏復述熱河形勢之重要、以熱河地勢、居高臨下、東北對遼黑、西南對河北、均爲建瓴之勢、得之可守可戰、並歷舉秦漢唐元明清各朝經營遼東之得失、均以熱河爲轉移、故日人决以全力奪取、我國亦應以全力保守、蓋東北之收回、不能不用武力、如熱河一失、東北即永無收回之望也、次穆藕初述我國經濟組織較古、可以持久作戰、不慮破產、鄒秉文述希望國人各盡其力、以赴國難、並望徐氏貫其專研之卓見於當局、即告散會、</p>
<h3>市聯會電請行政院不再續訂中日商約</h3>
<p>如能實行經濟絶交</p>
<p>尤爲人民所禱求者</p>
<p>｜林康侯談似應續訂惟須修正｜</p>
<p>市民聯合會、爲中日商約期滿、昨電南京國民政府行政院宋代院長云、中日商約附件、規定互惠、三年期限、行將屆滿、查此種互惠、日利我害、本不應有、即使日本無侵佔我國領土、破壞我主權、已無展期或重訂之必要、爲特電請順從民意、保護國家利益、訓令主管機關、明白宣告此項附件規定互惠之效力到期爲止、以戢其野心、如能實行、與之經濟絶交、尤爲人民所禱求者也、敬乞鑒核施行、上海市民聯合會叩、虞印、</p>
<p>中央社云、關於中日關稅協定續訂問題、昨據林康侯談、中日關稅協定、行將期滿、各方有主張該協定期滿後、不必續訂、但據鄙見、中日邦交在未宣告斷絶前、事實上似應進行續訂、惟續訂時須將其中不平等各點、竭力加以修正、本市一部分商人、亦同具斯感云、</p>

<h3>本市將開徵地價稅</h3>
<p>徵收租界營業稅娛樂捐</p>
<p>市財政局均仍在接洽中</p>
<p>中央社云、關於本市地價稅營業稅娛樂捐之徵收、中央社記者、昨晨往訪市財政局長蔡增基氏、適蔡氏因公務繁冗、未能親自接談、特派第三科長沈同代爲接見、據談如次、</p>
<p>地價稅　本市財政土地兩局、前奉市府訓令、會商土地稅徵收辦法、曾經呈覆、轉呈中央核示、已經財政内政兩部核議、准予備案、惟對於土地稅名目、改爲地價稅、市府業已接到財内兩部該項咨文、至於徵收區域、擬先就滬南滬北兩區舉行、浦東等區暫緩開徵、將來地價稅徵收區域、當免徵田賦、俾免重稅、稅率雖未確定、但决不超出千分之二·五、該項稅徵收後、市庫收入、每年可增百萬元左右云云、</p>
<p>營業稅　市府籌徵營業稅、歷時已久、惟因租界方面之阻撓、及滬戰損失等原因、故迄未開徵、至租界當局阻撓開徵界内營業稅原因、據悉、係藉口洋涇浜章程、在租界區域内、中國除國稅外、不得再徵收地方稅、並因租界内營業稅徵收後、勢將影響租界當局所徵收之牌照稅、故迭經蔡局長數度與租界當局洽商、迄未得結果、</p>
<p>娛樂捐　徵收娛樂捐事、蔡局長現亦正與租界當局洽商中、預料最短期内、即可開徵、至於本市財政每月收入、僅六十餘萬元、較之戰前、相差達十萬元左右、而市保安處經費、每年需九十餘萬、又盡歸市府擔負、以今日市庫空虚之情形、實不勝負擔、故已由市府咨請財政部撥助、現尙未得到若何結果云云、</p>
<h3>分别减免戰區地租</h3>

<h3>兩路管理局臨時車站定六月完成</h3>

<h3>廣濟輪航警隊擊退海盜記</h3>

<p>魚腥腦抛停　招商局廣濟輪、上班自滬開甌、船内載貨甚夥、搭客亦十分擁擠、駛至吳淞口外、經過魚山後、風浪甚大、兼下微雪、時已深夜、開抵魚腥腦海面、波濤大作、該輪船主、爲航行安全計、即令本輪就魚腥腦海面、擇風浪不及之處、停止駛行、就在該處抛錨、</p>
<p>黃花山遇匪　翌日天明、廣濟再從魚腥腦開船、直放溫州、駛至黃花山洋面、廣濟輪内船員、瞥見有形如漁舟之海盜船數艘、均從黃花山之島内駛出、向廣濟輪開來、企圖行刦、船主一面改開快車、一面喚集船内護航隊警士、速即出艙、集踞甲板、對於匪船實行射擊、</p>
<p>擊退各盜船　各盜船猝不及備、被廣濟航警密集射擊、致各盜船無法駛近、爲時頗久、盜知有備、又恐發電求救、軍艦到來、愈難倖免、故紛紛掉轉向黃花山附近海峽内逃避、廣濟輪遂得脫險、旅客驚魂亦得安定、從容開抵溫州、</p>
<p>隊長請獎　此次廣濟輪於本月四日從溫州返滬、抵埠後、船上各航警將遇匪擊退情形、報告局内航警隊隊長高殿臣、昨由高隊長據情報告總理劉鴻生、請將出力各航警、予以獎賞、藉昭激勸、劉總理業經批准、並將此事傳知各輪矣、</p>

<h3>怎樣完成地方自治？</h3>
<p>｜閭競明君來信</p>
<p>報載江蘇省已有多數的縣辦好閭鄰選舉了。但地方自治制度成立，未必卽地方自治眞正成立，一地方之眞正自治，必須經濟文化開發到相當階段，始後成功，用法規命令而產生的地方自治，不過徒具形式白費力氣罷了。中國原來是一個大的農業社會，所以地方自治應先從鄉村着手，這是大家所公認的。現在各地正有許多民敎職敎專家先後繼起向着這方面研求實騐，實爲鄉治前途之一綫曙光。講到鄉治的作法；關於人的問題，必以取才木地爲原則；關於錢的問題，必以本地富力將來　自負擔爲原則。但各地從事此種運動的，大多數皆是人是外面聘請來的，敎育等事，亦是外面貼錢舉辦的；這般用精神用物質來作，雖然　有些成績效果，可惜逐漸皆走向辦新村模範村的路上去了！縱有結果，結果不是了！梁潄溟先生對於此種錯處有兩點批評：㈠以辦學堂一樣的作法，增進鄉村富力，則怕細末得很。產業旣不能開發，則其他問題都得不到解决；　的問題不解决，則陋的問題不得解决。換言之，產業發達，文化始能增進，若單從敎育上文化上作功夫，都不免枉用心力！㈡以辦敎育的法子，作鄉村改進運動，必落人才錢財一槪倒貼之路。以全國之大，數十萬農村之多，其人其錢將來之於那裏？若說作完一處，再作一處，並希望别人聞風興起，却怕中國民族的命運等不得那許久呢！我想梁先生所指摘的弊病，在一般學者，亦未嘗没有慮到。然而不如此又將如何？還有什麽高妙的法子？事關建國大計，請大衆供獻意見！</p>
<p>答：來信提出『地方自治』這個問題，煞是有趣，用在本欄鄭重提出，請讀者大衆各抒所見以相討論。記者且先就來信所提各節略貢所懷藉以就敎於足下與讀者大衆。㈠足下說：『地方自治制度成立，未必即地方自治眞正成立······不過徒具形式白費力氣罷了。』這一段話就表面看來，似乎比一般人盲目地高呌地方自治要好得多，實則是殊欠明瞭。不錯，『地方自治制度』是一事，眞正的地方自治，又是一事；『地方自治制度成立，未必即地方自治眞正成立』這話是對的。然而人家要問：怎樣才算得『地方自治眞正成立『呢？那你的『一地方之眞正自治，必須經濟文化開發到相當階段，始能成功』的答語，就不夠了，不但不夠，而且是『隔靴搔癢』，不但是『隔靴搔癢』並且是『驢脣不對馬嘴』爲什麽呢？因爲足下首先没有把『地方自治』這一個名詞的内容，至少是没把　的現代意義弄清楚。原來這個名詞本身表現得非常明顯，地方自治就是地方人士自己起來管理自己地方的事，不受上級官廳如　謂省政府，縣政府，等而上之中央政府的干涉；在『經濟文化開發到相當階段』的地方固應當自治，在經濟文化尙未開發到相當階段的地方也是百分之百地方應當自治，足下所謂『必須經濟文化開發到相當階段，始能成功』，實在是受了現在的政治與社會關係之傳統的零圍氣所包圍，帝國主義者對他所掠奪的殖民地說，你們的經濟文化還未開發到一定的程度，還不能夠脫離我的統治；一俟你們的經濟文化開發到相當的程度，我們會讓你們自治或則獨立；你說：「必須經濟文化開發到相當階段，始能成功，這無異對一大羣要求自治的人民說：你們的文化程度太低。譬如小孩子一樣，還不能夠獨立行動，必得爲父母的支持，一俟你們文化程度到了相當階段，就准許你們自治。這種自治，我們可以名之曰保育政策的自治，或一恩賜的自治；』又可說是少數人包辦下的名義上的自治，不是我們所說的具有現代意義的自治。這話怎講？恩賜的自治，或名義上的自治，在城市是官僚，軍閥，劣紳，土豪所操縱，在鄕村則是大地主，和劣紳土豪所操縱的自治。這種自治一樣地壓迫貧民，甚　多數小康者與中農以下的農民都在被壓迫之列。不但依然一樣地壓迫，並且把壓迫的程度越發加深了，把壓迫的範圍越發擴大了，不過從前的較隱秘的形式，現在換了一種公開的，或則說是『文明的』形式罷了。這樣的自治，就現代的社會關係說，絶對不能解决一地方最大多數的政治問題與經濟問題，就是說，不是眞正的地方自治。縱然，　的馬路修得也很好，公園也很大，學校也很多，所謂公共事業也應有儘有，我們若果從牠的最大多數的居民的實際利益與物質的，精神的幸福想一想，那就曉得，這一切一切所謂經濟文化都與某地方之最大多數人不相干，所以我們反對這種虚僞的地方自治，而主張眞實的地方自治，所謂眞實的地方自治，其基本條件略如下：㈠地方的整個政權屬諸地方的最大多數的平民；㈡地方政權的行使則屬諸地方最大多數的平民所直接選舉的地方議會；㈢地方的一切產業爲地方之最大多數的平民所有；㈣所有地方最大多數的平民的子弟對於國民敎育及高小敎育應一律免費；而對於其牠一切高等敎育也應一律平等；㈤最大多數的平民無條件地有結社，集會，言論，出版，居住之自由：㈥免除一切苛捐雜稅及一切封建賦役與商利貸；㈦地方議會爲了本地方最大多數居民的利益與安寗，得徵集最大多數居民的壯丁組織自衛團。若果這些條件辦不到，那地方自治徒是一種欺人之談而已，足下知道：『用法規命令而產生的地方自治，不過徒具形式白費氣力』，而未嘗言明怎樣才能獲得不致徒具形式白費氣力的眞正的地方自治，然而除了我們上邊所舉的各條件之外，還有什麽是眞正的地方自治？足下以爲何如？（未完）</p>

<h3>中國體育界之空前壯舉兩江女籃球隊將環遊歐美</h3>
<p>吳市長任籌備委員長</p>
<p>志在丨發揚民族精神·觀摩世界體育·聯絡</p>
<p>世界婦女感情</p>
<p>兩江女子體育師範之成績、久爲國人所稱許、尤以籃球隊之表演、最爲卓著自滬上提倡女子籃球比賽以來、兩江連連獲勝、凡海上之西僑女子、亦甘拜下風、十九年戰平津、二十年遠征日本朝鮮、環　數十次、均無不　滿載榮譽奏凱而歸說者謂、兩江爲國增光不少、近聞該校欲作進一步之研究、爰有遠遊歐美之計劃、組織籌備委員會、現由上海市長吳鐵城氏任委員長職、主辦一切、業已開始籌備、其主旨爲發揚民族精神、觀摩泰西女子體育、且藉此機緣、聯絡國際間之婦女感情、樹立世界和平團結之基礎、至於技術比較之短長、非其所計、然該　能不憚艱辛、作此遠涉重洋之壯舉、開中國體育界之空前紀錄、吳市長熱心籌辦、不遺餘力、俱足爲吾人之所欽榮也、茲探錄該隊之宣言如下、</p>
<p>宣言</p>
<p>外侮日亟、國難方殷、値此國家民族危急存亡、舉國力謀以鐵與血抵抗强敵之嚴重時期、而敝隊乃作歐美之游、國人或將謂爲非其時乎、今當出國之先、請將此行之義、爲國人進一言、</p>
<p>健强體格之國民、乃國家生命之基石、具有健强體格之民族、必能致其國家於强盛、體格孱弱之國民、其國勢未有不爲異族所侵凌者、一優勝劣敗、弱肉强食、」理至顯然、我國國民之體格、雖非盡較外人爲不若、然以多數自溺於宴安耽樂、而日漸於文弱、卽有少數努力振奮之個人或團體、對於體育勇猛精進、其造詣非不深湛、其體格非不健壯、惟以未　乘機向世界表現其成績、變更各國對我之觀聽、終使外人祇見國人之　弱、而不知尙有健壯者在東方、病夫之恥辱、永未煎雪、而外人乃認我爲可侮、而肆其侵略焉、我國　引外侮之原因固多、而體育之甘落人後亦未始非主因之一也、故提倡體育救國、爲敝隊此行之第一義、</p>
<p>我國國民對於體育之忽視、殆以婦女爲尤甚、數千年來種種束縛之結果、身體上已呈病態、所以敝　創立之主旨、卽引婦女體育爲已任也、十二年來、對於各種體育之設施、差幸稍有成就、二丨年敝隊東征日本、爲我國婦女體育開始向國外露其頭角、結果雖獲東亞獨步之地位、然外國體　足資效法者甚多、未可遽以自滿、欲完成我國體育向上之企圖、非採納世界各國體育之精幹、不足以資策進、故觀摩世界體育、是爲敝隊此行之又一義、</p>
<p>世界和平之基礎在國際友誼之敦睦、國際友誼之聯絡、尤須各國國民感情之融洽、此國民外交與政府外交之所以並重也、當前世界戰機四伏、我國國民爲酷愛和平之民族、正應及時爲全人類負其責任、况未來　爭、我國首當其衝、爲自謀安全計、亦當竭力作和平之倡導、雖然、暴敵當前、義無反顧、伏尸流血、自不可免、而友邦與國之聯合、共同制裁、破壞世界和平之暴徒、國民亦非不可致力、故聯絡各國國民感情、倡導世界和平、是爲敝隊此行之又一義、</p>
<p>革命後之中華民族、呈蓬勃之朝氣、而我解放後之婦女、尤逈非昔比、　各國國民、囿於數十年前之成見、尙以爲我國婦女、仍是深閨纒足之時代、爲使世界明瞭我國之進步、認識東方行將復興之民族、敝隊擬於遍游各邦參觀其體育設施之前、更將歷年刻苦修成之球藝、與世界士女一較身手、藉以表現我革命後民族之新精神、使知我國婦女、已非自甘雌伏、而欲顯身於世界婦女角逐之塲、至於勝負之算、則非所計也、倘因此而引起國人、對於體育普通之注意、及使世界知中國、亦有努力體育之婦女、則敝隊此行爲不虚矣、</p>

<h3>鐵鳥······金魚</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>本來飛機是件玩具，在十八世紀的時候，葡萄牙人初次發明的，是個汽球，利用煤氣或熱氣而上昇天空，和我國舊曆初年裏兒童所放的亮燈一般。後來改爲飛艇，如德國齊柏林飛艇，最爲有名。它的功用，也不過載載客人，仍不離於娛樂游戲的性質，没有當作戰爭軍器用的。後來飛機的製造，輕便迅速，偵敵投彈，攻城略地，比槍砲的效用，尤爲偉大。暴日的欺凌中國，不過靠這幾隻飛機來耀武揚威！可憐我國在商湯的時候，已經有了飛車，到了戰國，公輪子造木鳶來窺宋城；直到於今，不但没有進步，連自己國貨的飛車木鳶，只有其名，没有其物了！可是亮燈花砲，依然五光十色，來點綴新年，做了兒童的玩具。</p>
<p>日本人呼飛機呌做「鐵鳥」，陳濟棠說中國海軍似「金魚」，眞是一個絶妙好對。我國從甲午年吃了日本海軍的虧，　次又吃了日本空軍的虧；吃了日本海軍的虧，我國的海軍，依然没有覺悟，翻一變而爲「金魚。」吃了日本空軍的虧，我們似乎有些覺得，航空宣傳的大聲疾呼，在下很希望我國鐵鳥，一天一天的多了起來，不要也像金魚一般，天空只多了幾隻紙鳶，祇做了兒童的玩具。</p>
<p>鐵與金比，當然鐵賤金貴，可是「日邊來鐵鳥，」有什麽用！也許要做釜底游魚，受人烹割了。我希望將來中國空軍海軍，都振興起來，金魚一變而鯨魚，紙鳶一變而爲鐵鳶，那末，暴日還敢欺凌我們麽？</p>
<h3>冷話</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>天氣一冷，大家都冷得蜷頭縮頸，恨不得睡了一夜，明天起來，寒暑表已昇到了六七十度，不亦樂乎。天氣冷，果然可怕，其實呢，世上不拘甚麽事，甚麽物，凡是沾上一些「冷」氣，總是没有好事情幹出來的。</p>
<p>譬如說：他人一本正經告訴你一回事，你却報之以一聲「冷笑」，令人好不難堪。二人揎拳捋臂，雙拳對着二手，一决雌雄，你却去送一下「冷拳」，這是多麽不道德。他人的處境，十分危險，你明明有力可以援救，但你却「冷眼」看着，不加忠告，這種居心，何等陰險。他人已覺十分痛苦，你却再去「冷言冷語」的譏嘲一番，這是何等可惡。二將交鋒，大刀闊斧，馬上步下，大戰數百回合，不分勝負，你去放一枝「冷箭」，雖然打了勝仗，也稱不得英雄，算不得威武。</p>
<p>再譬如說：「門前冷落車馬稀」，此情此景，何等凄凉。「枕冷衾寒」，異鄕孤客，大抵都嘗得到這種况味。蘇滬一帶，有一句俗話，呌做「冰清水冷」，形容一種孤單寂寞的情景，猶如「冷廟」裏的一年到頭没有一些香烟，何等可憐。三家村的冬烘先生，帶了一羣拖鼻涕高足，鷄鳴狗吠的子曰詩云，這種生活，呌做「坐冷板凳」。板凳已不可與沙發同日而語，板凳而再「冷」，其味如何，已可想見。更有一句欲話，呌做「熱面孔窩冷屁股」，描摹求人之苦，可稱入木三分，而全得力在一個「冷」字上。</p>
<p>世上最可怕的，最壞事的，就是一個「冷」字。據說：月球上没有生物，就因爲「冷」却的緣故。地球的末日，也是要「冷」却的。我於是知道人心「冷」到了零度，就是亡國的吉日良辰！</p>

<h3>保俶塔之今昔</h3>
<p>— 周雲亭記并攝影</p>
<p>似　花美人的保俶塔，就在溫柔嬌艶所組合的西子湖寳石山巔，尖削如春筍般的塔身，是永久保留着我國古代的建築美，這也是吳越王所建的。它的老伴侶丨富有神話色彩的雷峯塔，不幸的在民國十三年，全部圯毁，空　着一堆瓦礫，供人憑弔！現在因它年久失修，也是岌岌可危，朝不保幕！市府恐蹈了「前車之覆」，就將那建老伴侶的欵，移來把它修理一下。</p>
<h3>今</h3>
<h3>桃花運</h3>
<p>— 石顏也</p>
<p>王醫生一小白臉而深研歧黃之學，尤擅婦科兒科，所以懸壼數年，生涯鼎盛，活人無算。</p>
<p>兩年前的今日，是一個新年中的下午，他偕友人走到一位算命靈騐的瞎先生門前，經同伴的慫恿，進去請他推算一下前程。旣報告了年月日時，瞎先生顚頭簸腦輪指念念有辭了一會說：你在今年二十六歲起，到二十九歲止，這四年中大交桃花運，必會遇着一個女人，而小小破點財。</p>
<p>他辭别瞎先生，走在途中，同伴都笑着向他說：「恭喜！恭喜！」「遇着女人」！他聽了這頌詞，似喜歡，而又似恐怖。</p>
<p>他回到家來，終於恐怖之心戰勝了喜歡之念。他想：女人是多麽可怕的東西，傾家，蕩產，毁名，喪身，甚至傾城傾國，都與女人有緣。他又想到他有一副小白臉，有富有的家庭，有婦科的學問而天天撫着女人的玉臂，聞着女人的香澤，有兒科的聲譽而與病兒的母親或姊姊時時接觸。他想到這些，想到瞎先生所說的桃花運，而越想越恐怖了。他覺得他的財產事業身體，一切的一切，即刻便要敗於女人之手而恐怖了。</p>
<p>他恐怖，他想戰勝恐怖。他想要戰勝恐怖，惟有離開女人。事實上是不能離開女人的。無已！其遇而不視，視而不見罷！他以前臨診，對着旁坐的女人，撫伊的玉腕，觀伊的氣色，問伊的病情，問到伊的不可對人言的病情；一面在開方子，一面還要折轉頭去向伊問長問短。現在他完全改變了這個臨診方式。他正襟危坐，手指雖不能不觸着伊的玉腕，可是兩目却不敢一窺伊的氣色。雖然也詢問伊的病情，但是不敢對面而談的。他祗知女人的病，而不見女人的形。非伊的年歲和他母親彷彿，絶不敢向伊看一眼。</p>
<p>他怕桃花運，他怕以桃花運而遇着女人而喪財害身敗事業，所以伊戰戰兢兢，以這樣的方式臨診已兩年如一日了。他交桃花運兩年了，再過兩年，桃花運就要退出了。他準備着長期抵抗，準備以已往兩年的精神，奮鬭於將來的兩年中。小說</p>

<h3>一闋新翻援義軍</h3>
<p>— 堅匏</p>
<p>在報上看到天一公司和平華</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>無線電研究社合辦廣播無線電臺的消息，引起我參觀該公司的動機。我不曾參觀過影片公司和播音臺，現在有了這一舉兩得的機會；怎肯錯過·</p>
<p>影片公司的大門，雖然不曾懸着「××重地，閱人莫入。」的虎頭牌，但輕易也不許參觀，我和該公司老板邵醉翁先生，有一面之雅，總算不被拒絶。</p>
<p>批霞娜懷娥鈴交　着，各位女明星依着預定的節目單，挨次對着麥格爾風唱歌，小小的一間播音室裏，充滿着琴韻歌聲。伊們唱的歌，好聽固然是好聽，不過都是些抒情寫景之類，没有什麽深長的意義。最後是陳玉梅女士唱「援助義勇軍，」歌凡四疊，譜和詞都是高天棲君所作，音調固然悲壯蒼凉，詞句更屬激昂慷慨，現在把歌詞錄在下面：</p>
<p>「㈠白山失色，黑水無聲，敵人任意逞兇橫，流血遍野，殺人盈城，飛機擲彈最堪驚，未曾做，亡國氓，已無處，可逃生，世間公理向誰爭？哀東北，盡寇兵，我同胞，性命輕，痛深創巨恨難平！㈡飛沙撲面，北風怒號，義軍勇氣薄雲霄，奮身殺敵，躍馬揮刀，血花點點濺征抱。餐風露，宿　蒿，彈將盡，心更焦，冰天雪地冷難煞！抗强敵，救同胞，保國土，立功勞，中華民國大英豪。㈢衣香髫影，酒綠燈紅，舞塲歌館樂無窮，摩豋男女，華貴雍容，車如流水馬如龍。君之目，旣不　，君之耳，又非聾，奈何心地竟懵懵？念關外，盡哀鴻，義勇軍，難過冬，問君有否動於中？㈣人心未死，中國不忘，免除糜費戒荒唐。筵開湯餅，祝壽稱觴，不如移欵助前方，軍政學，農工商，一致起，救危亡，大家踴躍解錢囊，助義軍，固國防，收失地，驅虎狼，中華民族有榮光！</p>
<p>播音完畢，邵君領我到攝影塲去參觀，塲中正在拍黎明暉胡珊主演的「追求」。我問邵君，最近有無新片開映？邵君說：「最近攝成的「孽海雙　，」是一部攻擊遺產制的作品，不久卽可開映。」我說：「我很希望貴公司多攝幾部激發愛國思想的影片，因爲這類影片，是現在中國最需要的！</p>
<h3>我們的話劇在那裏</h3>
<p>— 台生</p>
<p>梅蘭芳到美國去和范朋克握手，程艶秋也渡過大洋和法國人見面，這是中國固有國劇的榮譽！</p>
<p>但我們的「話劇」，那裏去了？蓬蓬勃勃的「南國」，公演了幾次，便無聲無臭，各大學學生的劇團，也都烟消雲散；我們的話劇在那裏啊？</p>
<p>在歐洲，話劇院的宏麗，與一般人士對話劇的狂熱，我們便不得不感着無限的悵惘與失望！說我們缺少話劇的人材？我便不信。各話劇團公演中能有成功的人材，你說没有麽？你没有聽過唐叔明女士的哀訴？你没有看見過袁牧之君的表情和聲調？是失敗還是成功？</p>
<p>起來吧！這已不是專寫戰爭文學戀愛文學的時候了。我們所要的，是用我們民族的意識，去低訴給民衆，那「九一八」的意義，和「一二八」背後的光景，使我們的民間有一種普遍的體會！</p>

<p>新豐洋行報告、週一（六日）紐約股市、晨間趨勢疲萎、實業股與公用股跌至本年度之新低價、後芝加哥小麥因報告利於多頭、空户及大衆紛紛買進、價升一分餘、股市人心轉佳、各股因多回漲、全日成交數共六十七萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗花仍然晨平午堅</h3>
<p>紗市晨疲午堅、趨勢仍不脫盤旋、至於國外狀况、仍屬趨下、惟金價稍高、人心帶緊一步、客銷較上日爲多、於是市面略昂、但大量交易尙缺、查紗布倉庫中存積二十支紗有二萬三千多包、受其壓力不淺、</p>
<p>（人標後市散户抵補）人標前市開盤、以美棉微漲、但塲中市氣平淡、各月跌一錢、午後聞金市趨漲、原棉又高、散户抵補、各月漲一·二·三·四錢、某國紗又跌二元外、查全日成交統計一萬○五百包、查賣出穗隆二千包、明德六百包、同興三百包、益昶三百五十包、買進同孚一千六百包、協生四百包、永大五百五十包、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市晨平午漲、因金價向上、多頭方面活動、大半心理、外棉受匯兌影響、採辦銀盤較漲幾錢、買方購進加碼、頗不乏人、然廠方價高時、絶無問訊、且海外棉市、狀况依然疲軟、印　白洛區棉　盤跌二羅比、爲一百八十五羅比、</p>
<p>（鄭標後市多頭活動）鄭標前市開盤、以外棉平凡、塲中買户不多、各月平平、午後聞金市趨漲、人心激動、多頭活動、市盤向漲、各月漲一錢至一錢五分、全日成交統計二萬七千二百担、查賣出椿記一千担、源大一千九百担、愼記一千担、信誠一千担、買進益豐二千七百担、長豐一千九百担、吉豐九百担、長和一千担、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>美棉同業買進回好</h3>

<h3>糧食洋杜米疲俏不同</h3>
<p>薄稻稍　西貢昨有售開</p>
<p>客元與陰元甩落四五角</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、城鄉店胃稍有包胃僅四五百石、蘇同帮及南港等米市價無甚軒輊、僅薄稻及杜洋尖乏貨胃香、價格高挺角餘、陰元胃呆貨旺、形勢垂軟、常帮來原初到爲數不夥、高貨價開九元一角、中次貨開八元五角、廠家貨僅開出客元及陰元、市况兩無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各帮到船四十餘號、白粳店胃　平、四鄉胃呆、市形小角外、薄粳早稻來貨續有、另拆亦化津包稍動、價形定勢、杜尖到少價定、洋尖到貨續有、零胃懈淡、形疲尺外客、尖定勢、陰元定立、白元到雖不旺、零銷滯細、致價又跌四五角、</p>
<p>（客秈元）昨日客秈元續有到埠、客秈本銷甚活、客元存到兩多、兼有河下到貨、而去路只有閩省一路、本街則注重河下杜元、貨主仍主隨到隨脫、不願擯守、因此前日售開十元○三角之蕪湖機元只開九元九角、稍次爲九元八角、中次者尙須照别、計由閩帮辦去三百包、閩帮又去湖南紅糙九十六包、價七元四角、客秈本街活潑、市居站勢、本街計辦去江西機晚二千包、價九元一角、次至八元七角、又湖南機紅米五百包、價八元六角、</p>
<p>（洋米）久無交易、近日洋商又有新貨兜攬、遠期四五月份合價低廉、頗有合划定購之可能、因此存貨之洋商更變宗旨、向主堅守者、亦有活動之意、昨有安利洋行售出一號西貢五百包、價八元八角半、米品尙佳、惟到申已久、略嫌陳宿云、</p>
<h3>平疲難振的粉麥市</h3>
<p>（麵粉近小遠大）昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩　疲之象、因洋麥報價、回好一一二四角左右、故開價後、本月份較前日曾好一分半、遠期亦帶好近分、惟至　盤後近期又復軟落、因客帮去胃、祇有零星交易、　外多頭、亦回出不少、　市氣復疲、遠期因廠抛不多、反趨平定、迫至下午開盤、本月份仍然不振、最低小至一兩八錢零二厘半、如客帮觀望、恐須打破八錢關口、遠期因客帮略有活動、市見穩定、照此情形、倒掛局面、將從此軋平也、結果本月份較前日反小二厘半、二四月份大二厘半、五月份大七厘半、六月份大一分二厘半、七月份大一分云、</p>
<p>（小麥買賣兩難）昨日期麥市面上午開盤後、各月份呈平平之象、且各盤交易、仍未暢旺、盤盤空拍居多、迨至下午開盤、交易比較活絡、惟市塲終　籌碼不豐、進出均難發展、依然有賣難買亦難之感、此種情形、須至洋麥旺到之際、方有生色可言、結果本月份不動、三四月份、各小一分、餘無比價云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　扁枝開價轉升</h3>
<p>｜糯米枝好貨稀少｜</p>
<p>金山扁枝因存底不多、號盤漸見上升、現市上牌高貨開至二十八兩、上中檔二十六兩六錢、次二十二四兩、糯米枝號存亦缺、昨市較高者開七十六兩、次略减、號盤頂上好貨呌售八十兩、木耳近市上莊川耳開過五十八兩、上莊宜昌耳五十五六兩、市勢尙穩、同時行盤原包高什耳售五十六兩、普通五十五兩、惟走塲未旺、一時無過漲之望、</p>

<h3>生活與生命</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>阿榮他們娘兒兩個種完了大麥，覺得身上鬆快了許多，像是從肩膀上放下了沉重的擔子。另外，每人的心　都感着歡樂。做媽的，爲了過幾天可以接來一個兒媳婦，自己可以多少享一點老福，她歡樂。兒子呢，兒子有兒子的想法：他將有一個渴望已久的妻，從妻的身上他可以得到說不出口的一些處。······</p>
<p>一榮兒，就剩十幾天了。做母親的常常算着日子，而阿榮聽了媽的話，更是打心裏往外樂。</p>
<p>因爲他們接這個新娘子，只要接來拜拜天地就完了，以後就成了夫妻，並不要買東西請客吃酒，這全是爲着省錢的緣故。</p>
<p>阿榮的家，五十多歲的老媽之外，就只是他自己一個，從任何方面說來，他早就有把妻接進來的必要！她可以治理家事，她還可以抽空到田　做一點活，但是，爲什麽會遲延到這時候呢？這原故也狠簡單：他没有錢。</p>
<p>不管怎樣，總算那一天快到了，那是比什麽都好的一天。他，同他媽，娘兒倆個都盻望那個日子快快到來。······</p>
<p>阿榮把妻接到家裏，已經十多天了，這短短的十幾天中，不但阿榮自己，連阿榮的媽　算在内，還可以把妻也算在内，每人都似乎過着一種新的生活。這裏面，有親熱，有溫從，有安慰，有生氣，絶對不是從前那種冷落，沉寂的樣子。</p>
<p>兒子滿意自己的妻，做媽的滿意自己的兒媳，兒媳也看得起這一個不富有的家！</p>
<p>這就任什麽都好了。</p>
<p>「媽，吃飯啦。」</p>
<p>第一回聽到兒媳喊吃飯的時候，做媽的正在田邊看麥芽，那時候，簡直樂的不知道怎樣才好，因爲家裏的事情，兒媳担上自己的身上了。她一邊走着，一邊就笑着說：</p>
<p>「媽來啦。」</p>
<p>媽知道正在做活的阿榮，要她來喊一下了，兒媳才來不幾天，喊男人是喊不出口的，媽見日頭比兒子同媳婦見的多，事情知道的廣，所以她喊了一聲：</p>
<p>「阿榮，吃飯啦。」</p>
<p>看阿榮把鋤頭背上肩頭，喜洋洋的走回來，做媽的心中快樂極了，望着從自己身上生下來的兒子，呆了。</p>
<p>西斜的太陽，接着把娘兒倆個送進屋，然後轉動着自己的光輝到另一個世界去。（未完）</p>
<h3>「負責」與「不許負責」</h3>
<p>— 李冰</p>
<p>自從所謂「國難」發生以後，政府除鄭重地派人到日内瓦的國際聯盟去折衝樽俎以外，也十足誠懇的對小百姓說過：「天下興亡，匹夫有責；政府準備長期抵抗，願小百姓做政府的後盾。」</p>
<p>小百姓老實得很，似乎全誤會了政府的好意，於是組織反日會，編練義勇軍，請願示威，循而至於對政府有了詰難。政府的要人見不被諒解，眉頭一皺，於是某地的反日會因在「不得已的苦衷」下被封，某處的義勇軍因有「某種嫌疑」而被解散，請願示威的學生也「自行失足落水」者多人，全做了「負責」的犧牲，情形似乎有些類乎「不許負責。」</p>
<p>然而在上者還是若無其事的「宣言」與「要求」，「請大家負起救國的責任，作政府的後盾，政府一定要抵抗到底」</p>
<p>糊塗人到此，不免要懷疑到在上者的「言行不一致」，爲什麽一方面要人家負責，一方面又似乎不許人家負責呢？却不知「責」原不止一種：有些「責」是要請大家負的，有些「責」可是不許大家負的。譬如募捐接濟軍餉，這是在上者所最需要的「後盾」，這種「責」是要大家負的。</p>
<p>募捐的方法很多，最好的是游藝募捐，茶舞募捐，···寓激昂慷慨於風流綺麗之中，一方面政府旣得實惠，他方面又可使得一班浮燥小子受着色情的麻醉，再也没有精神去組織反日會，編練義勇軍，去負越俎代謀的責任</p>
<p>除了募捐接濟軍餉之外，其他的一切，則在上者自有辦法，不勞小百姓　心。愚蠢的小百姓們啊，請認清你們的責任罷！</p>
<h3>獄中的兄弟</h3>
<p>— 季亮</p>
<p>我有一個同年的兄弟，雖然出世是同年的，但他强於我，他有一腔時時沸騰的熱血，和一副堅决反抗的骨幹。</p>
<p>半年前，他爲了參加一個對外的反什麽的集會，被一羣不准「反」的同胞，將他和他們那一羣帶走了。我着手從各方打聽他的下落，許久得不到結果。於是我開始憂慮着：他會有什麽意外的不幸嗎？尤其是他那强於我的時時沸騰的熱血和堅决反抗的骨幹，不知是否無恙？</p>
<p>約莫過了兩個月之後，突然接到他從Ｗ城獄中寄來的信，不消說，我是欣慰了，但同時又懷着這樣的恐懼：信裏不免有着悲酸的淚！痛苦與悔恨交流的淚吧？等到拆開看時，才知道猜錯了，他只寫了一些獄中的生活狀况，重要的是下面的幾節：</p>
<p>『前樓般大小的房間，打得下六張舖，容納着我們九個同伴，慣常了也不怎樣擁擠。</p>
<p>『一天吃四頓：上午九時，乾飯，九時半稀飯：下午四時又是乾飯，四時半又是稀飯。</p>
<p>『初到這裏時，每天每餐的菜蔬，都是單調的黃橙橙的青菜；現在我們每星期竟可以吃到兩次萊菔，兩次青菜夾豆腐和一塊猪肉了。這樣，我在這裏也經常可以看到肉與豆腐的樣子了！</p>
<p>『每次飯後，照例每人可以分到一杯開水，我們就將這九杯水匯合起來供給兩個人洗滌之用。這樣，我們每五天中就可以講究一回清潔了！』</p>
<p>他對於監獄生活是這樣幽默地辨味着，顯然是泰然處之的。從信的開頭以至收梢，没有發　絲毫悲酸，痛苦與悔恨的氣分，自然更没有一滴淚。</p>
<p>接信以後，就打發我的妻去探望他。伊回來報告，說是相見的時候他還帶着固有的微笑，臉上反而顯得胖了些。於是我也泰然了。</p>
<p>新近又接到他掛號寄來的那個六年徒刑的判决書，還附着這麽幾句話：『你看了這個，便可知道我這次官司是吃得如何的滑稽，而表現在我面前的運命之　的形相又是多麽的頑皮呀！』他不說寃枉而說『滑稽』，不說兇惡而說『頑皮』，這使我這位弱者，感到一種不夠理解的神密！</p>
<p>廢曆年節到了，我得到個親去探望的機會。但是可笑得很，當我站到那個直徑不到一尺的接見的窗洞時，竟已失却鎭靜的力量而不住地顫動了！跟着一種驚心的鐵鍊聲，我那睽隔半年的兄弟的面龐，終於顯露在相距數尺的另一個窗洞邊了，於是我勉力地發出顫音，訊問一切丨所謂一切，實際上不過三五句錯亂而斷續的問話罷了。可是他呢，依舊帶着原有的微笑，而且確實是泰然自若地，說着他要說的話。</p>
<p>當離開監獄以後，我羞愧自己的卑怯，後悔着所問的話之無意義與不詳盡：幸而我的兄弟最後的幾句話丨一個報告，已給了我最大的安慰與不少的勇氣。他說的是丨</p>
<p>『我最近因爲仍不守分，被罰打手心一次，又增加了一副鐐銬。』</p>
<p>我理解這「不守分」是一種怎麽樣的作爲與含着怎麽樣的意義，於是我確知他『一切』無恙！</p>
<p>監獄的冷酷能夠冰住他時時沸騰的熱血嗎？鐐銬的重壓能夠軟化他堅决反抗的骨幹嗎？</p>
<p>不！不會的！因爲我已得了可以深信的根據。</p>
<h3>本刊第一次徵文結果揭曉</h3>
<p>去年十二月初，本刋爲測騐一般讀者對於當代世界名人之認識起見，特舉行第一次懸賞徵文，文題爲：「當代世界十大偉人」，應徵的條例是：「就當代世界政治家，科學家，哲學家，文學家···等著名人物中選出十人（已死者不算），每人附以一百字左右之簡單說明，但全稿以不超過一千字爲合格」，同時並訂定自今年一月十日起將取錄之卷，在本刋陸續發表。截至去年十二月三十一日止，我們收到的應徵文稿，共有五百三十四件。但因爲種種事實上的阻滯，徵文的結果，竟久久愆期未克公佈，在此，我們謹向應徵諸君鄭重表示歉意。</p>
<p>就五百三十四件應徵文稿統計，當選的十個世界偉人是：㈠甘地（四九二票）㈡莫索里尼（四五六票）㈢愛因斯坦（四四七票）㈣史達林（四一九票）㈤高爾基（三八七票）㈥凱未爾（三六五票）㈦居理夫人（三一四票）㈧蕭伯訥（二五八票）㈨托洛斯基（二四四票）㈩羅素（一七八票）。上列十人，便是我們這次測騐的結果。</p>
<p>但，除了上述的結果以外，我們又獲得了一種意外的收穫。這意外的收穫，便是我們把應徵文件中所列舉的中國人統計了一下，得到十個得票比較多的中國偉人。這十個中國偉人是：㈠蔡廷鍇（四八票）㈡馬占山（四三票）㈢蘇炳文（三九票）㈣朱慶瀾（三一票）㈤朱霽青（二七票）㈥馬相伯（二二票）㈦蔡元培（十九票）㈧史量才（十五票）㈨蔣介石（十一票）㈩汪精衛（八票）。</p>
<p>當然，這種結果，我們還不能認爲是正確的，因爲應徵的是僅僅只有五百三十四人，但從這種結果上去觀察，我們應該至少可以知道『人心』之一斑。</p>
<p>這次徵文取錄的五名是：㈠薛大華君㈡鄭　賢君㈢余卓庵君㈣程本瑾君㈤李猶龍君。薛君　卷，當於日内在本談發表，敬希讀者諸君注意。</p>
<p>韋紀，煦，繆，夏璆，璆，慧儀，李雲，蘇，銘彝，徐尙周，裘鵬，老蘇，庶幾，石徑斜諸先生鑒：請將現在住址示知，以便將上月份稿費單寄上。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「一看見那個日本佬，就把自己冷落了，豈有此理！······到底是非我族類啊！·······」他一面上樓梯，一面氣惱起來。由氣惱而傷心，他的廉價的眼淚幾乎又奪眶而出了。「又不是了不起的美人，而且也有些年紀了。還迷戀着她做什麽！······」</p>
<p>他想到不得開交時，又這樣地自寬自慰。</p>
<p>他走了一天，實在疲倦了。他學得臉皮上給風吹了，有些澁澁的難過。但是回到自己房裏來，不單冰冷得像陰間一樣，也不見有人送開水上來給他丨丨不單鶴子夫人不見來，連那個娘姨近來也傲慢起來，對於他的事，招呼得很不週到了。他當下又氣不過，忙走到二樓的樓梯口，高呌了一下娘姨。</p>
<p>「娘姨，快到老虎灶去泡熱水回來給杯先生洗臉，並快點冲茶上去！」</p>
<p>他聽見鶴子夫人這樣地囑咐娘姨，剛才的氣又有些平下去了。</p>
<p>他怕冷，洗好了臉，便脫去了外衣，只穿着貼身衫褲，鑽進被窩裏來了。他直覺着，鶴子夫人等一會一定會上來看他，安慰他，所以儘醒着眼等她。最初他拿報紙來看，但看不入神，心裏只是在猜度鶴子夫人和那個日本佬的關係，及他倆在下面的情形。</p>
<p>「他倆是久别重逢啊！丨丨久旱遇甘雨啊！丨丨眞愛情是不拘年齡之差異的！······」</p>
<p>他這樣想着，心裏感着有一種無名的娥妬。他傾耳靜聽了一下下面的動靜後，再看了看才解下來擱在枕畔的手表，快　響十二點鐘了。下面的客似乎已經走了，沉寂寂地没有一點聲息。</p>
<p>「假如客走了，她應當上來看我的，丨丨她一定是和平時一樣，躡着脚尖，推門進來，丨我趕快把頭蒙在被窩裏，丨丨她走到我的床邊來，掀開我的被角，丨丨我假裝睡着了丨丨她用根手頭來抹我的嘴角，丨丨啊，啊，丨丨我還是閃着眼睛，丨丨順個勢伸出一隻腕來攬住了她的頸項，丨丨她不提防仆倒到我的身上來了，丨丨親嘴，親嘴，不住地親嘴！丨丨就是這樣！就是這樣！······」</p>
<p>他的身體在前一個時辰是像冰淇淋一樣的冰冷，但在此刻却像初開鍋的肉饅頭了。丨丨不，他的被窩裏簡直是一座火熖山了。他興奮起來，再睡不着了，只是翻來覆去。</p>

<h3>貞烈在這年頭兒</h3>
<p>— 小夥子</p>
<p>｜爲紀念做了一個怪異的夢而作｜</p>
<p>抓住筆桿，劈頭，我就想，但不很願意老年之幌頭擺腦，攏袖搖腿哼着「嘆世風之日下，恨人心之不古」，「貞」「烈」在這年頭兒，殆已摸桌凈盡矣！」</p>
<p>我嘗自誇於友朋間，因爲我讀過了好些像「孟姜女萬里尋夫」這一類三貞九烈的歌本，又看了許多「苦諫不納，痛哭流涕，最後一頭撞死金堦之上」以及「作正氣歌的文天祥」和「城陷被殺的史可法」這一流忠烈臣子的小說記事，至於像岳武穆關壯繆，還有征東征西的薛家父子，和單刀赴會的神情，當然是我印像中最深，一閉上眼睛，也能描畫其神氣的偶像，因此，朋友們就嘲駡我是反背時代的思想落伍者，他們的理由和根據是幾千年來「貞操」二字，直接不知該殺害了多少青年婦女，間接也是毁滅人羣的東西，在如此革命的高潮時代，這樣背反人道，慘酷殘忍的行爲，自然是我們革命的對象，「貞操」之消跡於今日，正是革命成功的喜象呀！至於「忠烈」這名詞，更是不値價的東西，那是自私的個人英雄主義的至上信條，雖說「烈」士能而敢拚死爲國家作最後的掙扎，但，這太狹義，太膚淺，太無濟於事了，我們是革命的新青年，根本就要打破這狹義的白送死的名詞，而應當鎭靜容忍於當事之前，用清醒明晰的腦經决定作長期抵抗，這才是廣義的，徹底的，實際的，革命的，······</p>
<p>我於尙未聽完這一大篇徫大的革命的理論之前，我就好像大徹大悟，又似如有所悟，於是我才說，我才搶着說，就像上海罷，打開報來，滿眼的「通姦」，「誘姦」，丨這名詞太不雅觀，應改作「戀愛」或「發生肉體關係」丨甥媳與娘舅，姪兒和小嬸，至於姘頭，野情人，···簡直是家常便飯，男女們都會玩的把戲，丨這般普遍的實惠，如此方便的門徑，自然是没有「貞操」作祟的功績啊，</p>
<p>「忠烈」之給推翻的利益，那似乎更不需多話，毫無疑義，人家打上我的臉，挖去了我一目，但因對方是强暴者，我得先「鎭靜」一下，把火性「容忍」住，免得吃眼前的「大」虧，厲害些，性命還得不保，那是多危險，再退後一百步說，眼睛去掉一隻，還存一隻，老命亦在，這多少總是値得的事，而且先讓步，然後慢慢想法來「長期抵抗」，等着自然會有一天給我復仇的機會，所以，唯有「鄕人」才眞傻，才會去學文，那班白痴去白送死，那眞不足惜呢。</p>

<p>— 秋倫</p>
<p>明末遺民臨刑詩</p>
<p>相傳明末遺民某，因謀顚覆清社，事敗被執，臨刑時仰首占詩云「顰鼓聲催急，晚山夕陽斜，黃泉無宿店，今夜落···。」聲未竟而頭已隨「落」字下地，後人哀之，無不猜下文爲「誰家」二字，嗚呼慘矣，</p>
<p>高麗亡國遺民詩</p>
<p>亡國遺民，愴懷身世，見之於詩，自易動人，下爲高麗遺民臬司金調元，留别金陸父老四絶，寫亡國之痛，哀凄欲絶，際此吾國山河破裂，國難日亟，去亡國之途，殆已不遠，捧誦此詩，益爲聲淚俱下矣，詩云</p>
<p>到底春歸人未歸，故鄕風景是耶非，覆巢燕子凄凉甚，更傍誰家門巷飛，</p>
<p>金甌殘缺涕潸潸，凄絶韓臣入漢關，最是六朝風景好，夢魂猶唱念家山，</p>
<p>勸名羞列二臣傳，氣節猶存逸老篇，國破家亡何處去，江南流落李龜年，</p>
<p>亡命歸來四邊無，窮途落寞一身孤，勸君莫說江南好，啼鳥聲中有鷓鴣，</p>

<h3>談談鷄蛋</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>人類最有營養價値的食品，除牛乳外，當推鷄蛋。我國酪業不發達，牛乳之分布不廣，决非人人能享受，而產量豐多之鷄蛋，卵黃，並不自供食用，反有大宗輸出；國人之不知營養，可想而知。今將鷄蛋之營養價値，述於后：</p>
<p>鷄蛋之成分　欲使讀者明瞭起見，故先述鷄蛋之成分，再述其營養價値。　　鷄蛋爲蛋殼，蛋黃及蛋白三者所成，平均每蛋有六十克重，蛋白佔十分之六，蛋黃佔十分之三。若論其成分，因品種及飼料之關係，頗有差異。平均有水分七三％，蛋白質一四％，脂肪一二％，礦物質一％，及人生不可缺少的維他命。</p>
<p>詳言之，蛋黃含較多之含燐質脂肪，蛋白質亦較蛋白中多二倍，有充分之唯他命Ａ，Ｅ，及少量之唯他命Ｄ及Ｂ。其所含之礦物質中有鈣，鐵，燐，銅，及多量之硫。皆爲蛋白質及脂肪化成爲吸收率甚高之有機物。</p>
<p>蛋白中之礦物質較少，主要者爲食鹽。此外含有少量之維他命Ｂ，及○·五％之糖而已。由是觀之，蛋黃之滋養價値，較高於蛋白，實無疑慮。</p>
<p>鷄蛋之營養價値　鷄蛋營養價値之高，盡人知之。據伏兮脫氏Ｖoit云，鷄蛋一枚中，蛋白質六克及脂肪六克之營養價値，可抵四十克之肥肉，或一百五十克之牛乳。</p>
<p>蛋黃中之脂肪，在胃腸中極易消化，其吸收率達七八％。而蛋白質之吸收率達九七丨九八％。鷄蛋之消化率與煑時之久暫及溫度，有密切之關係。煑熟者須三時半，始得完全消化；半熟者三時；炙燒者二時半；生者需時最少，祇二小時。但生鷄蛋雖易消化，因有抗酵素Ａntltryptic（受熱則死）之故，有下痢之作用，且其於腸之吸收率，反較煑熟者爲小。</p>
<p>近來科學家，經實騐之證明，謂銅有助鐵製成紅血素之能，今鷄卵中二者皆有，其量雖似渺小（銅○○○一三四％，鐵○·○一％）然其於益於人身者，已非淺鮮。</p>
<p>蛋黃中富有維他命Ａ及Ｅ，就其量言之，較新鮮牛乳所含者，有十倍之多。故現已證明，蛋白能防止小兒之軟骨病。</p>
<p>動物性中，最有滋養價値者，當推牛乳及鷄蛋。若能二者並食，尤有大益。蓋牛乳中缺少鐵質，鷄蛋能補充之，而鷄蛋中缺少之燐質，牛乳中含量亦非小。故此二物並用，可稱爲理想中最上之補品。尤宜於嬰孩，妊婦及貧血者。因其礦物質極適合於人體組織之建造，其化學原質，均爲構成筋肉，骨酪及血液之要素。</p>
<p>鷄蛋之腐壞　鷄蛋旣爲人類之滋補品，其蛋白質等之有機物，亦適宜於細菌。且蛋殼表面有無數細孔，有數種桿狀細菌，鑽入後，即起腐敗作用。因鷄蛋含有多量硫，故常有硫化輕之臭氣發出。欲防止此弊可以油脂性物，如凡士林，羊毛脂等，薄塗於蛋殼之表面，則細孔阻塞，細菌無路可入，可歷久不腐</p>
<p>鷄蛋之鑑别　凡將鷄蛋透視，明亮者新鮮，黑暗者陳舊。又鈍端有水氣泡者亦爲新鮮之證。鷄蛋放置過久，水分蒸發，故其比重滅輕，吾人利用此理，置鷄蛋於五至一○％之食鹽水中，視其存浮，而定新陳。</p>
<h3>小計算</h3>
<p>— 阜民</p>
<p>｜究竟可以配出多少種｜</p>
<p>自從去年利華皂廠創始了人面配合競賽以後，就有棕欖香皂的猜麻雀牌競賽，孩兒面的審美競賽，和最近高塔牌香烟的猜塔競賽，在普通看來這種猜謎並不見得怎樣難，當我們把牠仔細一算，究竟可以配出多少種的時候，就知道這種得獎的也不亞於香檳呢？</p>
<p>現在我們爲便利起見，先把數目減底了做一個例，然後再推論下去。</p>
<p>假設現在有高塔，鐵塔，金塔三種塔，塡入三個空白的塔裏，那没可以配出以下幾種：</p>
<p>（第一項）　（第二項）　（第三項）㈠高塔丨丨丨鐵塔丨丨丨金塔㈡高塔丨丨丨金塔丨丨丨鐵塔㈢鐵塔丨丨丨高塔丨丨丨金塔㈣鐵塔丨丨丨金塔丨丨丨高塔㈤金塔丨丨丨高塔丨丨丨鐵塔㈥金塔丨丨丨鐵塔丨丨丨高塔</p>
<p>第一項可有三種變化，第二項祇能變兩種了，因爲第一項已列的一項不能重覆了，（譬如第一項塡的高塔，那没第二項不能再塡高塔）。到第三項的時候祗有一種了。（譬如第一項塡入的高塔，第二項塡入的鐵塔，那麽第三項不問可知一定是金塔了。）所以我們知道</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>項數和其變化的種數是層次減少的，那没我們知道可以配成：</p>
<p>３×２×１＝６種。</p>
<p>由此我們可以推論到猜塔競賽可以配成</p>
<p>１２×１１×１０×９×８×７×６×５×４×３×２×１＝４７９００１６００種。</p>
<p>審美競賽可以配成</p>
<p>８×７×６×５×４×３×２×１＝４０３２０種。</p>
<p>猜人面的競賽和以上兩種有些不同，雖然二十五個臉，但同組的不能同時用，並且每次祇用五個，現在我們假設第一種父臉，那麽可以得到１×５×５×５×５＝６２５種。</p>
<p>用第二種父臉的時候也可以得到六百二十五種。而每組有五種，所以其結果可配得</p>
<p>５×６２５＝３１２５種。</p>
<p>至於棕欖香皂的配麻雀牌那是很複雜算學，不在小計算之列，故不論。</p>
<h3>新年漫筆</h3>
<p>— 非非</p>
<p>街上的人特别多，都穿得整整齊齊的丨乞丐例外。</p>
<p>畢竟人是聰明的，有理智的，想得穿，譬得開，去年没好好地過新年，今年總得要樂一樂。</p>
<p>大學查　北平大學生避難救國！</p>
<p>爆竹連珠砲似的整天整夜地響澈雲霄，似乎又在慶祝什麽白川陣亡樣地狂熱。</p>
<p>鑼鼓鼕鼕鼕，更點綴着昇平氣象。電影院的大口呑進又吐出那一批一批西裝革履的時代少爺，輕盈婀娜的摩登姑娘，中間還緊擠着一羣時代推不走拉不止的尶𡯓脚色，和少數爲藝術内去�</p>
<p>欣賞的學者之流。他們胸貼着背進去，又胸貼着背出來，劉伯溫先生預言的推背圖或許就是這麽一回事。</p>
<p>穿花緞袍子，毛葛馬褂的先生們，陪着他們的夫人，牽着他們的阿大，阿二······開年第一件大事，就是到丈人家去拜年；其次是老親新戚處去吃春酒。</p>
<p>想不出新奇的祝語丨究竟没有什麽什麽紀念節的標語口號容易撰，一揮筆，一開口，就是十名二十句，貼得琳琅滿目，喊得悲壯熱烈丨還是「恭喜發財」妥當。就是怎樣吧：</p>
<p>「恭喜發財」。</p>
<p>「大家發財」。</p>
<p>「元寳滾進來」，廢話，應當改「鈔票塞進袋」。不過字面上没關係的：還如現在「拜年還没改「鞠躬年」一樣。拜和鞠躬，元寳和鈔票分甚麽清楚？祇要像這麽一回事，大衆領會就得了。</p>
<p>檀香橄欖，五香茶葉蛋都說是元寳的象徵！這古典究竟是什麽出處，我還没考據到，總之新年裏家家都要備一些。拜年的客人見了這類東西，總得笑迷迷地吃他一個，如果量大能多吃的話更好，當時就像滾了些大洋錢到他們的荷包裏。</p>
<p>叉麻雀，打撲克，推牌九，擲骰子······大輸贏五十塊一底，小玩意兒就銅板來來。實在新年「嘸啥做」，弄弄牌，解解厭，管她媽的什麽一二八紀念，八二一紀念，反正還有政府在鎭靜地長期抵抗。</p>
<p>新年悄悄地溜跑了，你聰明的人啊，樂夠了吧？</p>

<h3>從井救人</h3>
<p>編者先生：鄙人年已及冠，本來在不久的將來，預備要與摯友某女士訂婚了。她是個賢淑幽默，而富於情感的女子；年十八歲；在家操作甚勤，尤能刻苦向學。不過近幾年來，她不時身體不適，微恙纏擾。當時也不以爲意，直至最近的兩月，她竟病倒了。往常我們遇見的時候，我當然問起她的病狀，但是她却老是瞞着我；不意多年的因循，竟造成了這塲大病。她請敎過許多名醫，她吃過許多貴重的國藥；但是結果竟石沈海底，絲毫没有影響。前天她同她的父母，搭船回甬，從事易地治療；這時我才知道她患的是肺癆病。啊！可怕的肺癆病！我經了這次突然的打擊後，精神上起了極度的不安。家父母爲愛子心的驅使，也拒了這頭婚事。爲了我畢生的幸福，爲了民族前途的健全，我誠然有毅然决絶的必要。但是我心裏存着這樣幾個問題：</p>
<p>㈠倘使她回甬後，一年半載，病就好了；那時再與她訂婚，有没有意外的危險？</p>
<p>㈡患肺癆病的人，固然没有結婚的資格和可能；但是她是我培植起來的一棵玫瑰，同時我也是她心靈上惟一的愛人。不幸她患了惡疾，已經失却了人生的樂趣；倘一旦决絶，實在是情何以堪呢？情天恨海，又怎樣去塡補呢？</p>
<p>㈢我難道没有法子，去减少她的痛苦嗎？</p>
<p>先生才智過人，定能出鄙人於這種苦境的。渴望先生的解答，眞不啻大旱之望甘霖也。專肅順請</p>
<p>撰安　黃葉敬上</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>編者按：肺癆病在我國社會内，流行日廣；原因雖非一端，但是患者的結婚，使牠得有更多的遺傳和傳染的機會，的確是一種重大原因。所以我們認爲這問題，大有公開討論的價値。</p>
<p>肺癆病的確非常可怕，患者的生命，遲早是不能倖免的。並且牠能遺傳於子孫，傳染於週圍的人們。所以肺癆病患者，實在没有結婚的資格和可能。因爲這可以促短他自己「帶病廷年」的生活；這可使他配偶或竟連同他的家族，同歸於盡；並且即使生了子女，這些子女，也一定會遺傳着這種惡疾。有許多激烈的優生學家，竟主張將肺癆病患者，驅逐出我們人羣之内；話雖過於激烈，但也不能謂爲無理。所以無論一個男子或女子，倘使已經證實他患了肺病，我們在任何條件，或任何情形之下，實在没有同他結婚的可能。所以我們勸黃君毅然的拒絶訂婚。從井救人，是犯不着的；何况結果，還救不得人呢？</p>
<p>但是據黃君提出的第一個問題看來，某女士的病勢，似乎不十分危殆：而且來信裏只說「她請敎過許多名醫的吃過許多貴重的國藥」而没有提起請敎過西醫，吃過西藥的話。我們以爲大可請高明的西醫診斷診斷，看她患的是不是肺病；即使是肺病，是否已達到了不可挽回的地步。萬一竟不是肺病，也未可知，即使是肺病，只須尙在初期，那就未始没有治愈的希望了。至於的確治愈以後，再行結婚，當然不會發生危險的。</p>
<p>末了我們知道肺癆病患者，最怕的是「憂愁」；所以診斷的結果，倘使尙有醫治的希望，那末黃君可以與她訂婚。這樣可以减少她的憂愁，促進他的治愈。好在以後再發現她不治的時候，仍可依法解除婚約的。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（十四續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>幼中對黛秋，一向以長輩自居。他以做叔父的資格去摟她吻她，心地是十分純潔的：雖然她有「不願尊稱叔父，而願呌他阿哥」的表示，也不過把她當作平常的小孩子說的痴話罷了，誰知道那時候她已蓄有深心。他眞笨得像蠢牛木馬一樣！</p>
<p>她對於他的無恥行爲，有了顯然的表示丨十二分鄙夷他人格的表示丨他便萬分懊惱起來。他怨恨自己不該受她娘的誘惑，不該受她娘的恫嚇，以致於鑄成這個大錯。他喪失了一個花朶般少女的愛，而去做一個半老徐娘的洩慾工具。她是一個純潔的處女，用一片眞情向着他。她想打破了傳統的階級觀念，去戀一個比她長一輩的男子。豈知他竟無動於中，反去愛上了一個淫賤的婦人，而她的情敵却不是外人，竟是她嫡嫡親親的母親，這是何等痛心的事呵！</p>
<p>幼中替她想，眞覺得傷心，而回過頭來替自己一想，又覺得萬分不値得。叔嫂通奸，和與姪女發生戀愛，一樣都是有關倫常的不道德事；不過這個姪女；是若華與不知誰何養的，並不是我哥哥的親骨肉，若論血統，與我没有直接關係，如果娶她作妻，還可以有一個强辯。若華是哥哥的愛人，與我永無偕老白頭的希望，除了洩慾以外，竟講不出第二個理由來。我與黛秋生了戀愛，被哥哥知道了，即使他不贊成，阻止我不娶她也就完了，斷不會喪失兄弟的感情：我與若華的不端行爲，若被哥哥曉得，他定要與我拚命。那時候我祇有死路一條咧。做錯了事，越想越懊惱！</p>
<p>幼中兩眼白瞪瞪地望着黛秋，一顆心像車輪似地旋轉。黛秋背着身軀對他，默默無言地望着窗外的海水，水的顏色漸漸的由蔚藍變成黃色，見得渾濁起來。她的眼淚也忍不住了，像斷線的珍珠般落下來，幼中見她兩肩聳動，心裏也像刀割般痛苦。他正想把昨夜若華威迫和恫嚇他的情由告訴她，求得她的原諒，忽聽得若華一路喊着女兒走進房來，將他要說的話突然打斷。</p>
<p>「那邊海裏有許多捉黃魚的小船，快去看呵！寗波的鎭海口都過了，明早一天亮，就會到上海咧。」若華進房來對他們說：幼中生怕她看出黛秋的淚痕來，回身擋着她的視線，嘴裏不住的敷衍着她，想陪着她出去，免得她去查問女兒。誰知她偏要拉着女兒同去，女兒掉過臉來，她驚異的問道：</p>
<p>「你的眼睛怎麽通紅的？」</p>
<p>「眼睛裏好像吹了一粒砂子進去，媽，你同我吹一吹吧！　黛秋撑開了鮮紅的眼皮對着她　的嘴。</p>

<p>Sugimura Seeks Assistance from Drummond Again</p>
<p>Committee of Nine Reschedules Drafting Meeting to This Morning</p>
<p>United States States Far East Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>But Declares Non-Interference in League of Nations Work</p>
<p>Geneva: No meetings today. The drafting committee of nine reschedules its meeting for tomorrow morning. League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, at the request of Deputy Secretary-General Sugimura of Japan, deliberately provides Japan with an opportunity to use its trial policy. Although Japan is extremely dissatisfied with the draft proposal, it still puts forward ridiculous proposals in an attempt to obstruct and delay the League of Nations' proceedings. The success of Japan's cunning scheme seems to be due in no small part to Drummond's assistance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles report that the Committee of Nineteen unanimously agreed not to recognize the puppet organization and not to cooperate with it. Diplomatic circles consider this extremely important and are not expressing satisfaction because if the League of Nations wants to uphold justice, it must make such a provision. However, it is difficult to predict whether there will be changes after this report is presented to the General Assembly. Even if it is successfully passed, it is difficult to predict how to sanction Japan's unreasonable opposition in the future. Therefore, one should not be optimistic about this, and should still pay attention to the development of the situation and adhere to our fixed position. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation, through Sugimura, Director of the Japanese Affairs Bureau of the League of Nations, delivered the Japanese government's final proposal regarding the report to the Extraordinary General Assembly to the League of Nations. This proposal was immediately forwarded to the Committee of Nineteen. Its content is not much different from the previous proposals, and it is based on the words of the Lytton Report: "Restoring the status quo is not a solution." It states, "The situation can be improved from the current state without causing disputes." The drafting committee was originally scheduled to meet today, based on the principles decided by the Committee of Nineteen yesterday, to begin drafting the final proposal. It has now been decided to postpone it for twenty-four hours. The reason for the postponement is only that the League of Nations Secretariat has not yet completed drafting the draft to serve as the basis for the work of the drafting committee, and there are no other reasons. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nine did not meet today and is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning. Therefore, the hope that the drafting work of the proposal held by various parties could be completed today has not been realized. Not only did the Secretariat fail to complete its draft today, but there is reason to believe that Japan's latest proposal is currently being actively discussed behind the scenes. It can be seen from this that neither the League of Nations nor Japan wants to break off relations. The degree of difference in opinions between the two sides is not very far in comparison. Therefore, there is still the possibility of finding a solution that both sides can be satisfied with, so that the mediation procedure under Section 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant can be carried out. The League of Nations General Assembly will be held in a few days, and the situation will become clear in the next few days. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Stimson States That U.S. Far East Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Consistently Opposed to Recognition of the Puppet State</p>
<p>No Criticism of League of Nations Work</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson declared today that he had not yet received a document from Geneva inviting the United States to be listed on the Committee of Nineteen's declaration against the recognition of "Manchukuo." Stimson also stated that the U.S. policy of opposing recognition has not changed. Stimson declined to discuss the work of the League of Nations' committee mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Six Guiding Principles Suggested</h3>
<p>Non-recognition of the Puppet Manchukuo</p>
<p>Methods of Sanctioning Undecided</p>
<p>(Geneva) After important discussions today, the Committee of Nineteen unanimously decided on the following principles to guide the drafting work of the Committee of Nine: 1. The ten principles contained in Chapter 10 of the Lytton Report must be taken as the basis for the draft, and the draft must adhere to the scope of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. 2. The maintenance of "Manchukuo" cannot be regarded as a solution, and the existing political system must not be recognized. 3. The existing political and legal system in Manchuria does not have the qualifications that would make it acceptable for recognition. 4. All member states must act in solidarity. 5. There must be several principles of non-recognition to support the resolution of non-recognition, so that the necessary factual recognition arising from consuls, etc., residing in Manchuria does not become an event equivalent to legal recognition. 6. Cooperation from non-member states must be sought, especially neighboring countries and signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty. The above six points are the general basis for the agreement of the meeting. There is also one thing that everyone believes must be resolved, which is the important question of what kind of procedures the League of Nations should have when either party does not implement the recommended solution. This matter is very difficult to handle. The Swiss representative Motta advised the meeting in straightforward and firm words to consider the sanction methods of Article 16 of the Covenant, but the meeting did not agree with this proposal. It was generally believed that since the proposal had already been launched, the potential situation in the future could be self-evident. The general opinion in the meeting seemed to be to maintain a kind of committee. The Swedish representative proposed that in addition to not cooperating with "Manchukuo," should each country pass a resolution deciding not to cooperate with the Japanese government while Japan is still occupying Manchuria, and set a deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria? However, the meeting did not support this question. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Sugimura Visits Drummond</h3>
<p>New Compromise Proposal Re-Negotiated</p>
<p>(Geneva) Deputy Secretary-General Sugimura visited Secretary-General Drummond at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th, formally submitted the Japanese proposal, and explained the Japanese government's position. Drummond told Sugimura that he would submit the Japanese proposal to the Committee of Nineteen on the 10th and ask the committee for its opinion.

<p>Geneva: The Japanese delegation received instructions from the home government at 5:00 p.m. on the 6th. At 7:00 p.m., it convened a meeting of representatives to review the results of the new operational plan. It was decided that Deputy Director-General Sugimura would be sent to meet with Secretary-General Drummond tomorrow to re-initiate negotiations according to the government's new instructions. The Japanese delegation decided on a policy of making every effort to carry out the third mediation procedure to the very end. However, if the Committee of Nineteen rejects the Japanese proposal with the anti-Japanese attitude decided at the meeting on the 6th during the negotiations and mediation procedure, it will immediately stop the third negotiation action and take the final measures. (Japan Union News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida sent back instructions to Plenipotentiary Matsuoka yesterday afternoon and stated that the new method was the final proposal of the Imperial Government and no further concessions or changes would be allowed. In particular, regarding the articles on the sovereignty of "Manchukuo," no doubts should be allowed to arise about Japan's recognition, or to obscure it. If the Committee of Nineteen does not recognize the new method, resulting in the failure of reconciliation, the Imperial Government will not be responsible. Finally, it added, "The Imperial Government has long been prepared for the application of Section 4. This has long been appreciated by your representative." (Den-tsu News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Public Assembly</h3>
<p>Resolution Requesting Government to Withdraw from League Immediately</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A public assembly on the Manchurian problem was held here this afternoon. Representatives from various political parties participated. Dr. 土方, a member of the House of Peers, chaired the meeting. A resolution was unanimously passed urging the government to withdraw from the League of Nations immediately. The resolution has been sent to Prime Minister Saitō, Foreign Minister Uchida, Army Minister Araki, and Navy Minister Ōsumi. The text states, "Since the League of Nations has not shown sincerity in its work to mediate the Manchurian dispute, and refuses to recognize the independence of "Manchukuo" and Japan's legitimate self-defense, it is hereby resolved that Japan should withdraw from the League of Nations immediately." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Uchida to Attend Privy Council Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Explaining Countermeasures to Deal with League of Nations</p>
<p>Seeking Understanding from Senior Statesmen</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida will explain the progress of the League of Nations and the government's attitude at the Privy Council at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, as well as the resolution taken in the worst-case scenario, and will seek understanding in advance. The content is generally based on the following points: 1. The Imperial Government does not merely want to conflict with the League of Nations, so it continues to make full efforts for conciliation. 2. According to the Drummond-Sugimura plan, the invitation of non-member states in the resolution of December 15 has been erased, that is, the authority of the conciliation committee has also been amended according to the Japanese government's request, and in the articles on the sovereignty of Manchukuo, it has been changed to the extent that there is no actual harm, so this new method is generally recognized as the Japanese case. 3. Whether or not the Committee of Nineteen will adopt this new method is still quite questionable. If it is not adopted, then Japan cannot make any further concessions, so the third conciliation procedure will fail and the responsibility will not be on the Japanese side at all, and the government is absolutely not afraid of applying Section 4. 4. If matters that violate Japanese national policy, such as not recognizing "Manchukuo," are inserted into the recommendation案 of Section 4, then Japan must withdraw from the League of Nations independently. Please understand this point. 5. The handling of the withdrawal from the League of Nations will be handled responsibly, especially with regard to the South Seas Mandate Area, although there is a view that withdrawal is not necessary for return. (Den-tsu News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Emperor's Chamberlain, General Suzuki, visited Duke Saionji yesterday on behalf of the opinions of senior statesmen to consult on the highest national policy to be taken towards the League of Nations. The military was very flustered upon hearing the news, fearing that the military阀's policy of aggression would be overturned by the senior statesmen. Army Minister Araki specifically visited General Suzuki this afternoon to explain the current situation in the Three Eastern Provinces, saying that if Japan does not take a tough policy, the Eastern Provinces will inevitably be Russified. The Russification of the Three Eastern Provinces is related to Japan's survival. If Japan retreats in this critical situation, it will not be able to survive. Therefore, he hopes that the senior statesmen will maintain the army's military policy to deal with the League of Nations and asks Suzuki to intercede on his behalf. In today's critical international situation, the Japanese military is doing its utmost to suppress all opposing forces. The military阀's final demonstration and its result are truly worthy of attention. (China United News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The trains on the puppet Fengshan Railway will be temporarily suspended for two weeks and will be resumed on the 13th of this month, because the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau has ordered 61 trains from the Kwantung Command for military use. Because the department has received a secret order from the Ministry of the Army, it has transferred 80,000 troops to Jin County, Suizhong, Yuguan, and Yixian on the Jin朝 road before the 10th of this month. Therefore, the trains on the Fengshan Railway are entirely for military use. The trains have been carrying troops in an endless stream in recent days, and it seems that Japan is determined to invade Hebei and attack 遼東. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

The Judicial Yuan has now resolved the issue through a meeting of the Interpretation of Laws and Regulations, and the interpretation is as follows: Foreigners who have served on Chinese ships for many years and have always lived on the ships can be recognized as having their residence in China. Only if they no longer have a residence in a foreign country can their residence be regarded as their domicile. If they continue to reside for more than five years, the Ministry of the Interior may, in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Section 2, Item 1 of the Nationality Law, permit their naturalization.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek and Generals Confer on Communist Suppression for Days</h3>
<p>Starting to Organize Nanchang Headquarters</p>
<p>=Additional Troops Under Chiang Ting-wen Ordered to Enter Jiangxi=</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Chiang Kai-shek, considering the relationship between the Jiangxi bandits and the southeastern half of the country, and that they cannot be eliminated in a short period, is starting to organize a unified command in Nanchang, with Xiong Shihui as Chief of Staff, Yuan Liang as Director of Political Affairs. Notables and important figures from Jiangxi will be recruited. Cao Haosen and Cheng Tianfang will also hold important positions. Chiang also telegraphed Jiangxi Central Committee members Li Liejun, Zhang Dingfan, and Gui Chongji to return to their hometowns for post-conflict recovery. Chiang, due to overwork, has a recurrence of dental disease but continues to review important official documents and military telegrams. Division Commanders Xiao Zhichu, Zhou Hunyuan, and Zhou Zhirou reported to Chiang on the military situation and bandit activity in their defense zones. Chiang, given the urgency of suppressing the communists, ordered them to return to their posts immediately and, according to the established overall plan, reach their designated locations within the specified time limit. He Chengjun, Zhang Nanxian, Shao Lizi, and He Guoguang have held lengthy talks with Chiang in recent days, discussing military, post-conflict, and political affairs related to communist suppression in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang. Shao Lizi insists on resigning, but Chiang insists on retaining him pending a central government decision. Chiang, considering that Zhu and Mao are rampaging everywhere, in addition to ordering Guangdong and Guangxi troops to attack the old communist base in southern Jiangxi, has also ordered the entire army of Chiang Ting-wen to enter Jiangxi.

The transport was completed at 6:00 AM this morning. A total of 2,121 boxes of artifacts were moved south. Because 3 boxes were damaged during the move, the number transported was 2,118 boxes.

<p>(Beiping) After the decision was made to move the artifacts from the Palace Museum south, the departure was delayed for days due to incomplete preparations.

It is expected that the train will depart at around 1:00 AM on the 7th. The second batch will depart after the vehicles are prepared.

<h3>Control Yuan to Submit Second Impeachment Against Gu Zhutong</h3>
<p>Must Ensure He Receives Due Punishment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan will submit a second impeachment case against Gu Zhutong. Gu has refuted the accusations in his reply to the Executive Yuan, but the Executive Yuan has not yet forwarded Gu's reply to the Control Yuan, so it must wait a day or two. According to the Control Yuan's impeachment law, after the first impeachment, if new evidence or more conclusive reasons are obtained, a second or third impeachment may be filed, and there is no limit to one impeachment. If the committee in charge of this case in the Disciplinary Committee abandons this case without referring it to disciplinary action for no reason, the Control Yuan may also impeach the disciplinary committee members in charge of this case. The executor of the disciplinary action is still the Disciplinary Committee. This is the same in nature as the Control Yuan being able to impeach corrupt members of the Control Yuan itself. However, the situation has not yet reached such a serious level. Specifically, regarding Gu Zhutong's shooting of a news reporter, based on the facts and the law, Gu must receive due punishment.

<h3>Japan's Rampage - An Ominous Sign</h3>
<p>(I) The More the League of Nations Prevaricates, the More Frenzied Japan Becomes</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident was submitted to the League of Nations for arbitration, although resolutions have been passed repeatedly, the so-called moral judgment and verbal justice have only been advocated by small countries such as Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Ireland. The major powers that actually control the actions of the League of Nations only offer lip service without any real action, in effect only delaying matters and allowing Japanese imperialism to expand its aggression wantonly. Every time our country makes a new request to restrain Japan's violence, the League of Nations prevaricates, engaging in another round of discussions that are inconsequential and unimportant. However, this only adds to the suffering of our people, and the land we lose is further expanded. Now they have even invaded Shanhaiguan and extended to Rehe. Judging by this, not only has the so-called "Manchurian puppet state become a fait accompli," but another new incident is about to emerge from Shanhaiguan to Chaoyang Temple. Our country's land is finite, but the new facts that Japan wants to create are infinite. Can we escape the danger of gradual encroachment by praying for the assistance of justice?</p>
<p>The discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute by the nineteen-member committee has now come to an end. "First, based on Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report (China has the name of sovereignty but has effectively lost the Northeast), it is acknowledged that it is impossible to restore Manchuria to its original state, but China's sovereignty in Manchuria is maintained. Second, the recognition of Manchukuo is opposed both legally and in fact. Third, the three international treaties, namely the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, must be strictly observed." However, it has been one year and five months since the Mukden Incident, and more than four months since the Lytton Report was published. China's sovereignty is still being trampled upon by the enemy's iron hooves. The original state of "Manchuria" has not been restored. As for the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it has been torn to shreds by the Japanese army's atrocities in the three northeastern provinces, the burning and killing in Shanghai, and the bombing of Yuguan. The League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty have also become scraps of paper under their iron heels.</p>
<p>What is even worse is that the Japanese government openly forces the League of Nations to recognize the facts it has created single-handedly – "Manchukuo (the puppet state)." Otherwise, it threatens to withdraw from the League of Nations. While we are indignant and encourage ourselves, we cannot help but deeply regret the League of Nations' accommodation and inability to take action. The Japanese government can still be said to be a tool of the military, guided by the will of the warlords. However, it should be known that Japanese financial capitalists behave in exactly the same way as the warlords. Leaders of Tokyo's financial, industrial, and commercial circles gathered to discuss how to deal with the issue of Geneva (League of Nations) restraining Japan. The most ridiculous thing was the speech by Kenji Kodama, president of Yokohama Specie Bank, who said, "No matter what kind of proposal, the Japanese only say 'I understand' in response, without any real action... An economic blockade is not a problem. France and Japan have a good relationship, and it will not be hindered by the actions of the League of Nations. The United States will probably be the same as before and will not take any action to increase the seriousness of the problems between Japan and the United States. The anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States will not happen. The Stimson Doctrine will not achieve anything in fact..." How rampant is this! This proves that the more the League of Nations accommodates Japan's so-called facts, the more frenzied Japan becomes, treating the League of Nations as nothing.</p>
<p>(II) Is an Economic Blockade Really Not a Problem?</p>
<p>Then, is Japan really not afraid of an economic blockade? Japan is called a great power, but its domestic iron ore reserves are only 100 million tons, its coal reserves are only 800 million tons, and its oil reserves, including Taiwan, are only 120 million barrels. Can this meager amount really dominate East Asia and soar in the world? However, since the invasion of the Northeast, including the resources of the three provinces, it has considered itself capable of controlling China, threatening Britain and the United States, and controlling the Pacific. However, the actual facts are not that simple. Its domestic difficulties have also expanded due to the development of the invasion. The general society has also developed its contradictions due to the expansion of military power.</p>
<p>Let us take the budget deficit of this year as an example. The public debt to fill the revenue shortage is 660 million Japanese yen, the Manchurian Incident public debt is 186 million Japanese yen, and other special accounts such as telephone, earthquake relief, roads, and Korea, Taiwan, and Karafuto (Sakhalin) have issued public debt totaling 988 million Japanese yen. In addition, there are 900 million Japanese yen of public debt that was not issued last year. The total amount of Japanese public debt is expected to be 8 billion by the end of this year. At present, its treasury overdraft and temporary borrowing are about 600 million yen. Therefore, Japan's national debt is expected to be more than 8.6 billion yen by the end of this year, and the exchange loss of foreign debt is not included. This is passed on to the Japanese people, averaging about 150 yen per person. Even if it is extended to the people of Taiwan and Korea so that the colonies share the burden, the amount of national debt borne by each person is no less than 100 yen. In addition, the total amount of personal debt in rural areas is 7 billion yen. How can the Japanese people support themselves?</p>
<p>In recent years, the issuance of Japanese public debt has increased year by year, and all of the so-called national debt is unproductive public debt. Financially, the future Japan will be trapped in a state of declining income and unable to extricate itself. Future interest payments will also reach 500 million Japanese yen, and foreign debt is 1.48 billion Japanese yen. Even in nominal terms, interest of 80 million yen must be paid, plus the depreciation of the exchange rate, which will increase by 80 million to 100 million yen. It is feared that even using all taxes to pay the interest on public debt will not be enough, and the rapid expansion of military spending has further increased Japan's debt. Based on this one aspect of the increase in public debt, can Japan not be afraid of an economic blockade? Our people are under this rampant invasion, at a time when the enemy is about to collapse, how can we save ourselves?</p>
<h3>An Overview of America's National Strength (Washington Correspondence)</h3>
<p>The United States, with its vast land and abundant resources, was appropriately founded at a time when liberalism was rising. As a result of its vigorous development efforts, its production industries are flourishing. The European War allowed the United States to gain great benefits with very little sacrifice. After the war, the United States jumped to take the economic lead of the world from the British Empire, using its financial power to maneuver on the international stage for more than a decade. Although the recent economic panic has shaken the world, and American industries are gradually declining, its immense national wealth is still something that other countries cannot hope to match.</p>
<p>(Main Products) Although there are mountain ranges on the east and west coasts of the United States, the great rivers flowing between them and the vast plains contain extremely rich products. Maximizing its productivity is one of its unique advantages. The following is a brief description of the important products of the United States. (I) Mineral Products: The major mineral products of the United States are copper, pig iron, and coal, accounting for about one-half of the world's production. Oil production accounts for about 70% of the world's total production. Salt and other food products, as well as industrial raw materials, amount to 7.7 million tons. (World total production: copper 1.9 million tons, pig iron 98 million tons, coal 1.39 billion tons, oil, etc., 306 million tons, industrial raw materials 38 million tons). (II) Food: Rice production is less than our country's, but wheat production accounts for one-fifth of the world's total production (world total production 157 million kilograms). (III) Textiles: Of the world's cotton production of 5.8 million tons, 3.2 million tons are produced in the United States. Silk cocoons and wool are not as good as Japan's. Although there are many agricultural products that are not as good as other countries, the basic raw materials of modern industry, such as iron, oil, and coal, which are the basic raw materials of military industry, surpass all countries and almost monopolize them.</p>
<p>(Economic Reasons) The composition of the American nation is extremely complex, consisting of a mixture of whites, blacks, and other people of color. Moreover, everything is built from scratch, without any inherited old forces or old systems to bind them. Therefore, the nation is always full of vitality and progress. This intangible national strength is worthy of our special attention. Regarding the formation and characteristics of the American socio-economic form, someone conducted a detailed investigation a few years ago and listed the following eight points: (I) Natural resources, especially the resources of raw materials for large-scale industries, are far richer than those of other countries, such as oil, coal, and iron, all of which have extremely rich reserves. (II) There is a shortage of workers and wages are high. Resources are abundant and there is a lot of waste, so the standard of living is much higher than in other countries. (III) Due to abundant resources and a shortage of workers, the use of machinery in agriculture, industry, and transportation has been promoted to save labor, thereby generally improving the lives of laborers. (IV) The domestic market is large, and consumption and production can maintain a balance. (V) The full development of business management and organizational power, such as scientific management, is one example. (VI) Labor and management are very coordinated, and industrial institutions operate very smoothly. (VII) Businessmen always disclose their problems to society and entrust them to meetings or research to seek progress in management. (VIII) The characteristic of optimistic effort overflows in the economic world. Although there is no room for new development, everyone's actions are still very active and always upward.</p>
<p>(Overview of National Wealth) The extent of America's national wealth can be seen in the following table:</p>
<p>Comparison Table of National Wealth of Various Countries</p>
<p>| Country | Year | National Wealth (Millions of Yen) | Per Capita (Yen) |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>

<p>| Japan | 1924 | 102,342 | 1,731 |</p>
<p>| Germany | 1924 | 71,685 | 1,141 |</p>
<p>| Italy | 1924 | 44,738 | 1,171 |</p>
<p>The investigation methods of various countries are different. The above statistics are only for general reference. Moreover, strictly speaking, the so-called national wealth cannot be observed only in terms of numbers, because the use of wealth is different. The same amount of property can yield two completely different results, and the United States is particularly active in the use of wealth. Therefore, its actual national strength is even greater than the numbers show. An American scholar once said that although two-fifths of America's economic power should be attributed to resources, three-fifths should be attributed to excellent operational efficiency. Therefore, if something happens in the United States, it can quickly, accurately, and systematically mobilize industry and can be quite durable. This can be seen from the World War. In addition, there are 20 billion in foreign claims, which are not included.</p>
<p>(Agricultural Production) Although the United States has now become an industrial country, it is actually still a large agricultural country. The abundance or scarcity of its crops always affects the national economy. The United States has a very large domestic market, and production does not need to be dumped abroad. It can still be sold domestically. Its exports are only a part of the total production. Therefore, if the United States is blockaded, it can still be self-sufficient domestically and does not need to rely on foreign countries. This is one of the advantages of the United States. The wealth of the United States lies not only in its numbers but also in its power to use wealth, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, almost all of America's production is on a large scale. For example, in the case of farmland cultivation, the number of tractors is huge, unmatched by any other country except the Soviet Union. Because of this mass production, prices are low, and with low prices, sales are wide.</p>
<p>(People's Ability) We cannot ignore the inventiveness of the American people. Edison's electric light and movies, phonographs, and radios all came from the United States. Americans have also made great contributions to other inventions in daily life. American political commentator James Bryce once said that from 1784 to 1927, there were 48 major inventions in the world. In various mechanical inventions, such as telephones, papermaking machines, airplanes, and televisions, American inventors accounted for 38, while Britain, Germany, and France each had 4. From this, we can see the excellence of the Americans, and these mechanical inventions are all directly related to the economy and are all related to their national strength.</p>
<p>Moreover, the organizational power of the Americans is often above that of other countries. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank system during the war is one example. Other examples, such as scientific management and industrial rationalization in enterprises, all originated or originated in the United States. Since the United States is a financial country, its people's ideas mostly focus on utilitarianism and practicality. Therefore, Americans often say that it is better to develop immediately useful science than to study profound science, which shows the general nature of the national character. In short, the United States is a financial country, so there is a financial atmosphere everywhere. Although it is gradually declining due to the world's misfortunes, its immense wealth is still enough to dominate an era. (January 10)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Reports American Businessmen Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Distributing Leaflets and Pamphlets</p>
<p>Opposing Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, more than 4,000 American businessmen, in the name of the "All-American Non-Cooperation Association with Aggressor Countries," distributed leaflets and pamphlets last month, strongly advocating the severing of economic relations with Japan, boycotting Japanese goods, and advocating that a united front should be formed urgently to take decisive measures to deal with aggressive war actions. Moreover, the agent of the association reprinted and sent the same leaflets and pamphlets to businessmen all over the United States, and the situation is worsening. It is found that the purpose of the association is to eliminate Japanese-made silk products. Merchants in New York who operate Japanese goods have also been greatly affected by this movement. It is reported that the All-American Raw Silk Association held its annual meeting recently, and hundreds of attendees also distributed the same leaflets and pamphlets for publicity.</p>
<h3>Important Legal Interpretations of the Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>The Judicial Yuan's meeting to unify the interpretation of laws has recently resolved important legal interpretations. The interpretations are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Unmarried and Deceased, No Return of Betrothal Gifts) Interpretation of the case where a man died before marriage and the man's family sought to recover the betrothal gifts. The meeting resolved that according to previous laws and regulations, there was an explicit statement that betrothal gifts should not be recovered if a man and woman were engaged but had not yet married and one party died. However, according to the current provisions of the Family Law of the Civil Code, no betrothal gifts are required for marriage contracts. Even if betrothal gifts are actually given, they are only a kind of gift and cannot be revoked due to the death of the donor or donee, and a request for return cannot be made.</p>
<p>(Husband is a Eunuch, Annulment of Marriage) Interpretation of the legal application for a case where a man is a eunuch and his wife requests a divorce. The meeting resolved that eunuchs are incapable of having sexual relations. If it cannot be cured, the wife may petition the court to annul the marriage in accordance with Article 995 of the Civil Code, and the provisions of Article 1052, paragraph 7 of the same law do not apply.</p>
<p>(Cash Loan, Payment in Commutation) Interpretation of the subject matter of monetary debt fulfillment. The meeting resolved that since the original loan agreement stated a certain number of strings of cash, it should be converted into silver dollars at the exchange rate between cash and silver at the time of the loan to serve as payment.</p>
<p>(Interpretation of the Location of the Accountant) Interpretation of the location of the Accountant Law. The meeting resolved that the location referred to in Article 16 of the Accountant Law and the location referred to in Article 8 of the same law both refer to the location where the accountant performs his duties. The nearest association referred to in Article 16 refers to the accountant association that is closest to the place where the accountant performs his duties and has been established. There is no regional restriction on the accountant's performance of duties in the regulations, so the so-called nearest association can be an association in a neighboring province or city, and there is no need to join an association in the same province or city. Moreover, according to Article 7 of the regulations, the accountant should establish an office in the place where he performs his duties when submitting an application for registration, so the local industrial and commercial administrative authority will not have difficulty exercising its supervisory power.</p>
<h3>US Naval Exercises in the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>The Battle Proceeds to the Defense of the Coast</p>
<p>National News Agency, San Francisco, 6th dispatch: The US Navy's spring exercises have now progressed to the defense of the Pacific coast. Today, a simulated enemy fleet will attack the coast from Mexico to Alaska. This simulated enemy fleet is the same one that attacked Honolulu a few days ago, mainly composed of cruisers and destroyers, carrying many aircraft. It is now assumed that it has completely destroyed the Pearl Harbor fortress and launched an in-depth attack on the American Pacific coast. The defending fleet is mainly composed of battleships, most of which are concentrated on the California coast and the Panama Canal Zone, leaving only a few ships to defend. The military strength is weak and relatively easy to occupy. It is expected that the enemy will attack the California coast, so the main force is concentrated there. However, the whereabouts of the enemy fleet have not yet been discovered.</p>

<p>A Thunderbolt in the Disarmament Conference</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Urges Clearly Defining Aggression</h3>
<p>Refuting All Absurd Reasons for Implementing Aggression</p>
<p>International Monitoring Agency Begins to Be Trusted</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 6th: At today's meeting of the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov stated that the international agreement to abolish war could only have true meaning if a charter of national freedom was announced and explained to the world. Only the first section of the French disarmament plan involved all countries, and he was prepared to sign a convention containing such a proposal. However, the world was already familiar with the past incidents that were used as excuses for aggression. The definition of aggression must be determined first, and all the absurd reasons for implementing aggression must be refuted without exception. Only then would the international monitoring agency have the power, express justice, and be trusted by the people. Litvinov proposed a draft declaration explaining the term "aggressor country." Any country that declares war first, or invades or attacks the territory of another country without declaring war, is an aggressor country. Litvinov also stated that he would soon propose that the great powers must formally renounce their reservations regarding the Kellogg-Briand Pact. When discussing the flexibility of the meaning of "aggression," Litvinov said that there seemed to be a trend recently to think that Country A could attack Country B on the grounds that Country B was unstable internally, or on the grounds that it had investment relations, special interests, or lacked certain qualifications in Country B, or on the grounds of military strategy, or to expand its defense line beyond its own borders. This theory has been put forward recently and regards war as a way to guarantee peace. It should be known that if international arbitrators acquiesce to this theory, there will never be a so-called aggressor country in armed conflicts.</p>
<h3>Discussions Begin on French Plan</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 7th dispatch: At today's meeting of the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference, representatives from Poland, Spain, and the Soviet Union all spoke during the discussion of the French disarmament and security plan. Although the Polish representative agreed in principle, he was doubtful about whether the plan could be implemented today. The Spanish representative strongly criticized the French proposal. The Soviet representative, Litvinov, proposed defining the aggressor country in war, that is, the country that first declares war or first invades the territory of a foreign country or blockades the other party's coast. Litvinov then elaborated on his opinion, saying that implementing complete disarmament within the prescribed period was the only convenient way to solve the whole problem.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Discusses Diplomatic Issues</h3>
<p>Also Making Every Effort to Woo the United States</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th: During the meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Japanese diplomatic issues were discussed. At that time, someone asked about the impact of the friendly relations between China and Russia on the Manchurian issue, especially regarding the China Eastern Railway and the navigation of the Songhua River. Foreign Minister Uchida replied that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia had not yet had a negative impact. The Foreign Minister continued to answer other questions, saying that Japan was now closely approaching the United States to seek mutual understanding. Ambassador Debuchi in Washington was doing his best to do this. Some said that the US Atlantic Fleet was now gathered in the Pacific, which was not helpful to the peace and security of the Far East. The Foreign Minister was unwilling to express any opinion on this statement. Someone then asked about the government's policy on restoring normal relations between China and Japan. The Foreign Minister replied that friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries were necessary to maintain peace and security in the Far East. However, hasty action would be inconvenient, so Japan should adopt a policy of patience towards China. Finance Minister Takahashi then answered questions after the Foreign Minister, saying that the government did not want to increase income tax. However, the Finance Minister acknowledged that the collection of property tax was currently under private discussion. Someone asked what method the government planned to use to manage exchange rates. The Finance Minister replied that the government did not want to restrict exchange rates. The government's move was aimed at preventing irregular fluctuations caused by speculative activities, but fluctuations caused by seasonal orders and commercial needs would be allowed to occur naturally without interference.</p>
<h3>French Government Passes Budget Bill</h3>
<p>Submitted to the House for Discussion</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 7th: The new government's budget plan was submitted to Parliament this afternoon, stipulating a reduction of 5,500,000,000 francs in the national expenditure deficit. Of this, 2,400,000,000 francs will be achieved through austerity measures, including cuts in civil servant salaries. In addition, new taxes and other measures will raise 1,300,000,000 francs without affecting taxpayers. However, the Daladier cabinet is still uncertain, and most people believe that the hope of winning in the parliamentary financial debates is very slim.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th: The government's financial proposals were unanimously passed by the Cabinet today and will be reported to the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives tomorrow. The House of Representatives may present it for discussion on February 11th. According to the new government's calculations, the budget deficit is 5,500,000,000 francs, not the 10,000,000,000 francs claimed by the former Finance Minister Cheron. It is said that the budget deficit will be made up for by adopting austerity measures and increasing tax rates.</p>
<h3>Republican Party in the United States Begins to Divide</h3>
<p>Reorganization or the Establishment of a Progressive Party</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th: Farley is currently discussing with Roosevelt the allocation of several important positions to progressive figures within the Republican Party, in order to encourage the party's division. Republican leaders are discussing reorganizing the party along more liberal lines. Farley's scheme is causing great concern, as it is feared that once realized, the rift between the old guard and progressives within the Republican Party will be irreparable. However, Republicans are not entirely in favor of reorganization. Only a few leaders, especially Senator Couzens, Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, advocate for it. It is said that Couzens is willing to use his private wealth to finance the reorganization. Today, it was also heard that many Republican leaders plan to reach an understanding within the party on the reorganization issue before Farley finalizes his list, otherwise Cutting, Johnson, Norris, and La Follette have indicated that they will join the movement to establish a separate Progressive Party, fearing that once Farley lures them with important positions, they will no longer be able to remain in the Republican Party.</p>
<h3>Formal Declaration of Roosevelt's Election</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th: The United States Senate and House of Representatives will hold a joint session in the House of Representatives tomorrow, where the Speaker of the Senate will formally declare Roosevelt elected President of the United States in accordance with the law. Although the new President and Vice President of the United States were decided after the primary elections last November, those elected at that time were still primary election winners, with a number equal to the number of senators and representatives from each state. On the first Wednesday in January, these primary election winners gathered in their state capitals to hold a secondary election. The governors of each state then sealed and sent the secondary election ballots to the State Department. Thereupon, the Secretary of State compiles the secondary election ballots from each state and sends them to Congress tomorrow for the final counting and announcement procedures. However, the votes cast by the primary election winners are naturally for the candidates of their respective parties. Therefore, the number of secondary election votes can be determined after the primary election results are announced. In this election, the Democratic Party won forty-two states, and Roosevelt will receive four hundred and seventy-two electoral votes. The Republican Party only won six states, and Hoover will only receive fifty-nine votes. The electoral votes for the Vice President are the same. In the primary elections, the Democratic Party received 22,813,786 votes, and the Republican Party received 15,759,266 votes. Such a great victory and defeat is unprecedented in the history of US presidential elections.</p>
<h3>Joint Session to Commemorate Coolidge</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th: Today, the US Senate and House of Representatives held a joint session to commemorate the late President Coolidge. US President Hoover, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and other justices, as well as cabinet members, all attended the meeting.</p>
<h3>Philippine Leaders' Commonwealth Movement</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 6th: Currently, in Washington, there is a growing belief that Filipinos will not accept the independence bill passed by Congress but will instead demand to remain in a Commonwealth status permanently. It is said that Philippine leaders have inquired whether the Philippine legislature can accept the independence bill with certain reservations. Therefore, many US congressmen believe that this proposal by the Filipinos is the beginning of a Commonwealth status movement. According to one congressman, if both sides can maintain a clear head, the Philippine problem may be resolved in a way that satisfies everyone. However, those in both houses who support independence are adamant, saying that Congress cannot reconsider amendments. If the bill is rejected, it will be regarded as proof that Filipinos do not want independence. According to news from the Philippines, Filipinos do not seem very enthusiastic about independence without free trade with the United States and without US protection. They believe that although China can buy most of the Philippines' agricultural products, it is not easy to find a market for sugar, given its abundant production. Even Speaker of the Senate Quezon, the leader of the Commonwealth movement, believes that Commonwealth status is better than the current independence bill. He is currently studying a way to achieve Commonwealth status.</p>
<h3>Rural Areas of Uruguay Also Bankrupt</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Tacuarembó, Uruguay, 6th: Farmers in Uruguay are facing complete bankruptcy due to foreclosures on mortgaged land and a sharp drop in agricultural product prices. Today, they rose up to demand that the state legislature provide immediate relief, otherwise they will forcibly dissolve the legislature and elect a new one. According to news received here, all farmers in the Midwestern agricultural region of the United States are currently united to prevent the foreclosure and sale of collateral. All representatives and debt collectors sent by creditors are unable to perform their duties and are increasingly being forcibly refused entry. The demands of the farmers in Uruguay were made through a petition to the legislature by the Farmers' Holiday Association, which stated that if their request is not granted, there will inevitably be bloodshed throughout the state. The Farmers' Holiday Association is an organization that promotes the Farmers' Holiday movement. Its purpose is to advise farmers to store their grain and not sell it until relief is obtained. Its propagandists openly admit that this will eventually lead to a general strike by farmers. It is said that this movement was joined by most farmers in Uruguay last summer, but the scope was not large, and it was abandoned in the fall due to poor leadership. Now, many large landowners have joined, and its power is growing daily.</p>
<h3>Germany Implements Iron-Fisted Politics</h3>
<p>Emergency Decree Overturns Court Ruling</p>
<p>Behind-the-Scenes Plan to Amend the Constitution</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Today, the President, using decisive measures, issued an emergency decree, canceling the German Supreme Court's ruling on the Prussian constitutional dispute. The reason given was that the ruling was detrimental to the public interest of Prussia and therefore could not stand. The decree also granted the special central administrative officers of Prussia the various privileges that the previous court ruling had ordered the Prussian government to retain. Papen, the special central administrative officer of Prussia, has been ordered to implement the decree.</p>
<p>Today's presidential decree was also countersigned by Papen, because the Chancellor had gone to Munich for the election campaign and was therefore countersigned by Vice-Chancellor Papen. Since the promulgation of this decree, the original three-person committee of Prussia has been suspended, as Papen has replaced Braun as the Premier of Prussia. In addition, the chairman of the Prussian parliament, Kerrl, is also a member of the National Socialist Party. The third member, Adenauer, is a member of the Center Party and strongly opposes this emergency decree, believing that it violates the Weimar Constitution and refusing to participate in the three-person committee. Therefore, Papen and Kerrl have decided to dissolve the Prussian parliament on March 4th and hold re-elections for members on the 6th, simultaneously with the central general election. The Prussian government is now considering appealing to the Supreme Court again, but the future effect is likely to be very small.</p>
<h3>Dissolution of Parliament and Constitutional Issues</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The order to dissolve the Prussian parliament will take effect on March 5th, but the National Socialist government will not allow the parliament to reconvene. The members can only engage in election campaigns at this time. The Prussian government is now completely under the control of the National Federal Government, and the Prussian police are completely under the control of Prussian Administrative Commissioner Goering. Today, constitutional scholars across the country have been commissioned by the opposition party to study whether the government's move is constitutional. According to the opposition party, the government's order and the original order appointing the Prussian Administrative Council are both unconstitutional. When Papen first concurrently held the positions of Federal Chancellor and Prussian Premier, the opposition party filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court to test the legal nature of this move. The court's judgment concluded that it was unconstitutional. However, the government argued that the constitution did not explicitly stipulate the President's power over this matter. Therefore, today, it resolutely overturned the court's judgment and issued this new order. Observers of the current situation believe that behind the government's dissolution of the National Parliament and the Prussian Parliament, there is actually a plan to amend the constitution. Papen and Hitler have always advocated amending the constitution, especially the election law, which they urgently want to reform. Before the Papen cabinet resigned, it began to contact the National Parliament about certain amendments, but without success. Subsequent election results have proved that it is practically impossible to amend the constitution in the National Parliament. It is said that the government is currently considering convening a constitutional convention or asking the people to vote on two laws. Judging from the current situation, if the new National Parliament elected in March again fails to pass amendments to the constitution, it will probably directly ask the people for a referendum.</p>
<h3>Strict Orders Restricting Freedom</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th: The iron rule of the new Chancellor Hitler is being exposed day by day. Recently, he issued strict orders to restrict the freedom of the press and crack down on incitement to general strikes and false rumors that are likely to harm national interests. The order warns that those who leak military secrets will be punished summarily. It also states that newspapers can have their suspension periods extended for various offenses. Publishers who leak military secrets, incite illegal or violent acts, insult government officials, or spread false information that endangers important national interests will be punished with up to one year in prison. Local officials are also authorized to prohibit the collection of funds for political organizations. The Prussian government has resolved to file a lawsuit with the Supreme Court in Leipzig against the illegality of the dissolution of parliament, but the court is likely to issue a judgment only after the election on March 5th. Republican and Socialist organizations have also been hit, as the government has authorized the Minister of the Interior to prohibit members of the two parties from wearing party uniforms. Their meetings and parades must be subject to extremely strict supervision and cannot be approved without it. Since Hitler came to power, more than thirty people have died in clashes between the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party. Today, four people were seriously injured in Cologne as a result of the National Socialist Party's excitement, including an old woman. In Gladbach-Rheydt, National Socialists smashed Jewish shops, injuring two policemen. In Duisburg, a member of the National Socialist Party was shot and killed by someone in a factory while on duty. Another member of the Communist Party was also shot and killed. Communist deputies declared that the cabinet intends to declare the Communist Party's electoral list illegal.</p>
<h3>British Unemployment Rises</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 6th: According to the Labour Department's statistics, the number of unemployed people in Britain as of January 23rd was 2,903,065, an increase of 179,778 compared to December 19th of last year. The hotel, garment, cotton weaving, wool, and steel industries were the most affected.</p>
<h3>British Government Discusses Roosevelt's Plan to Resolve War Debts</h3>
<p>Ambassador to the United States Attends Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, arrived in Southampton on the Europa liner at 2:00 PM today. He immediately took the plan from Roosevelt to resolve the war debt and drove to London to attend the Cabinet Committee to participate in the discussion on the war debt issue with the United States. The meeting was held at 10 Downing Street and lasted for about two hours. Attendees included Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Lord President of the Council Baldwin, and President of the Board of Trade Runciman. Lindsay declined to comment in both London and Southampton but hoped to be able to say something after the meeting of Parliament tomorrow afternoon. The Cabinet will review Lindsay's report and the Cabinet Committee's opinion at its meeting tomorrow. If it can be passed unanimously, then the Prime Minister will submit it to Parliament for discussion. Regarding the future negotiations on British-American war debts, Chamberlain told British and American journalists last week that he did not advocate that British-American negotiations be limited to the war debt issue. Tonight, Lindsay dined with Prime Minister MacDonald and cabinet members, after which they continued the discussion. It is said that Lindsay intends to invite Prime Minister MacDonald to personally go to the United States to participate in the final negotiations. It is the general opinion that this is Roosevelt's idea. British Ambassador to France, Tyrrell, arrived in London last night. It is said that his return to England is to visit a sick relative and has nothing to do with the war debt discussion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Officers Donate Salaries to Fund National Defense</h3>
<p>What About Our Military Officers?</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 7th: After Japanese army officers decided to donate 3% of their salaries for the first three months of this year to fund national defense, the accounting bureau of the Ministry of the Army has now collected the first batch. The Army Headquarters, with Army Minister Araki at the head, collected 480.80 yen. The Army Staff College donated 511.19 yen. The Army General Staff donated 294.98 yen. The Surveying Department donated 99.61 yen, and the Supreme Military Council donated 41.96 yen. In addition, several military schools also made donations. It is now believed that a total of 20,000 yen can be collected, which will be transferred to the Ministry of Finance along with the 40,000 yen or so donated by soldiers of the Japanese army in Guandong, North China, and Korea. It is expected that the donations for the three months will amount to 100,000 yen.</p>
<h3>Tsai Tingkai's Trip to Guangdong Ends Successfully</h3>
<p>Deng Shizeng's Remarks</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondent: Tsai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, recently went to Guangdong to attend the Southwest Military Conference. According to Deng Shizeng, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, Tsai's mission was as follows: "Director Tsai was summoned to Guangdong by Minister Huang Shao-xiong because Minister Huang was ordered to go south this time to discuss concrete plans for resisting Japan and suppressing the communists with the southwest generals, and there are no other actions. This headquarters has already received a telegram from Director Tsai saying that the results of the meeting were very satisfactory and that he will return to Fujian within a few days. As for the report that the 19th Route Army will transfer eighteen regiments to the north to resist Japan, it is also not true. Although the 19th Route Army has always had the determination to resist Japan, its actions must be discussed with all parties in order to achieve unity. Director Tsai's attendance at the Guangzhou Conference was for this purpose. It is said that the Southwest generals have reached a consensus of opinion after this meeting, and in the future, the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi may each transfer a number of elite troops to form an army, led by Director Tsai to the north. However, the detailed content will not be known until Director Tsai returns to Fujian. As for the Red Bandits on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi, the seven divisions of Liu, Lu, Mao, Shen, Qu, Zhang, and Huang have already deployed from Guangze in northern Fujian to Wuping in western Fujian, covering ten counties in a large encirclement formation. The defense line is extremely solid, and the bandits have no room for activity. Therefore, even if Director Tsai leads his troops north, it will not hinder the military operations to suppress the bandits." (February 2nd)</p>

<h3>Xu Shuxi's Speech Yesterday on the International Situation</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Will Never Easily Allow Japan to Destroy the Covenant</p>
<p>Union with the United States and Russia Cannot Be Rejected by Claiming It Is Too Difficult</p>
<p>The International Problems Research Association held a general meeting of members at the Bank Club at 5:00 PM yesterday. Xu Shuxi, secretary of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, was invited to speak. Over a dozen people were in attendance including Chen Liting, Mu Ouchu, Zou Bingwen, Zhang Jiongbo, Qian Xinliu, Wu Renzhi, Chen Binhe, and Zhu Yinong. The meeting was chaired by Zou Bingwen. He stated that Mr. Xu Shuxi is an authoritative scholar on Northeast issues and international politics. This time, based on his knowledge, he held an important position in the international delegation. All important documents in international negotiations were written by him. He is fully prepared for the various problems that should exist in the future. This time, he returned to China on official business. In addition to expressing our welcome, we also take the opportunity to listen to Mr. Xu's teachings. Next, Mr. Xu spoke about the international situation on the Northeast issue and the diplomatic strategies that our country should adopt. After the speech, Zou Bingwen and Mu Ouchu asked about the true opinions of European countries and the Rehe issue. Mr. Xu gave detailed answers. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Northeast and the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Japan's invasion of the Northeast is a necessary step in its continental policy. Speaking of its relationship with the countries of the world, this move is not only an insult to our country but also an insult to the whole world because its actions completely violate the provisions of the International Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Non-Aggression Treaty. The League of Nations was initiated by various countries in view of the tragic results of the European War. Today, many of those active in the League of Nations have personally witnessed the tragic deaths of millions of people and the destruction of countless properties in the European War, and they will never easily turn a blind eye to the Japanese tearing up the covenant with one hand. For the past two months, the Chinese people have expressed despair at the pro-Japanese attitude of Britain, France, and other countries. I have always said that it is not as bad as rumored and there is no need to despair. If the League of Nations passes sanctions against Japan, the great powers, especially Britain, will bear the brunt. Because its navy is the largest, it can shoulder this task. Therefore, the great powers are most reluctant to give up using peaceful means as much as possible to avoid a complete break, so that they themselves will feel the difficulties. Today's Geneva report clearly shows that the Special Committee of Nineteen countries unanimously denied the puppet state. The true attitude of Britain can be seen. The attitude of the United States towards the Far East issue has not changed at all from its policies of "Open Door" and "Territorial Integrity." Of course, there is no possibility of understanding with Japan.</p>
<h3>China and Russia Share Common Interests</h3>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of relations with the Soviet Union, in terms of the geographical situation, the interests of China and Russia are almost completely consistent. After Japan annexed the three northeastern provinces, Russia's two coastal provinces cannot be preserved. If the Japanese force invades Mongolia, then even Siberia cannot be defended. After the Sino-Japanese War, when the Japanese took advantage of their victory to force our country to recognize the independence of Korea and cede the Liaodong Peninsula, the rulers of Imperial Russia believed that it had nothing to do with them and did not ask about it. Only one experienced old diplomat recognized the interests and formed an alliance with France and Germany to force Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula. Today, the situation threatening the Far Eastern territories of the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly tense. The interests of the two countries can be said to be completely consistent.</p>
<h3>Sino-American-Russian Friendship</h3>
<p>Now that we understand the international situation, let's talk about the response. In the international arena, our country must not relax a single step. Some Chinese people have recently advocated withdrawing from the League of Nations, which is ignorant of the situation. However, we should not rely on the League of Nations either. We should use diplomacy to unite the United States and Russia. Today, China and Russia have restored diplomatic relations, which is certainly gratifying. However, it is not enough to simply restore diplomatic relations. We should further seek friendship between China and Russia, and at the same time seek friendship between China and the United States. Further more seek the friendship between China, the United States, and Russia. In this way, our country can cope with its difficult environment with ease.</p>
<h3>Cannot Excuse Due To Difficulty</h3>
<p>If I say this, someone will say that it is easy to know and difficult to do. The saying "it is easy to know and difficult to do" is contrary to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's theories, and I don't need to refute it. Even if it is indeed difficult to do, those in power who are planning for the long-term interests of the country cannot excuse themselves in this way. Decades ago, after the Franco-Prussian War, France was under German control. Its environment was dozens of times more difficult than China is today. However, the French rulers worked hard to engage in diplomatic liaison. The Entente Cordiale between Britain and France, the Franco-Russian Alliance, and then the Triple Entente between Britain, Russia, and France to contain Germany. Britain and France have been deep enemies for hundreds of years, and Britain and Russia have also been enemies for hundreds of years. However, French diplomats did not give up because it was difficult. What's more, the relations between China and Russia, China and the United States, and the United States and Russia are not as difficult as those at that time.</p>
<h3>International Public Opinion</h3>
<p>After Mr. Xu's speech, Zou Bingwen inquired about the genuine public opinion of European and American countries regarding the Northeast issue. Mr. Xu replied that domestic newspapers were reporting the real situation. The United States, from beginning to end, upheld fairness. British newspapers were more conservative and deeply influenced by Japanese counter-propaganda, so they were initially confused. However, after the publication of the Lytton Report, their attitude changed and they also spoke fairly. As for the Parisian newspapers in France, their opinions were completely commercialized. Chinese diplomatic missions themselves were already struggling with funding, so how could they compete with the Japanese in buying public opinion? Therefore, they unanimously favored Japan. However, society was well aware of the value of French newspapers and did not pay much attention to them. There were two newspapers in Geneva, one whose editor-in-chief was more familiar with the situation in the Far East, so it was still able to uphold fairness. The other, a French newspaper, also favored Japan.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Rehe</h3>
<p>Next, Mu Ouchu inquired about: 1. If the Japanese occupied Rehe, would they continue to advance on Pingjin? 2. If the Japanese occupied Rehe, would the attitudes of the United States and Russia change? 3. If there were no brave anti-Japanese volunteer armies in the Northeast, what would the international situation be? Mr. Xu replied: 1. If the Japanese occupied Rehe, Pingjin would naturally be their target. However, it would depend on international reactions and the strength of our army's resistance. If our resistance was weak, the Japanese would definitely advance. 2. The attitudes of the United States and Russia would depend on our country's resistance. If we did not strive for self-reliance, we could not expect others to help us. 3. If there were no volunteer armies resisting in the Northeast, the international situation would be even more unfavorable to us. The current situation proves that the establishment of Manchukuo was not voluntary. Next, Mr. Xu reiterated the importance of the Rehe situation. Rehe's terrain is high and commanding, dominating the Northeast towards Liaoning and Heilongjiang, and the Southwest towards Hebei, with a commanding advantage. Acquiring it allows for both defense and offense. He also cited the gains and losses of various dynasties, including Qin, Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing, in managing Liaodong, all of which hinged on Rehe. Therefore, the Japanese were determined to seize it with all their strength, and our country should also do its utmost to defend it. The recovery of the Northeast cannot be achieved without force. If Rehe is lost, there will be no hope of recovering the Northeast. Next, Mu Ouchu stated that China's economic organization is older and can sustain long-term warfare without worrying about bankruptcy. Zou Bingwen expressed hope that all Chinese people would do their best to overcome the national crisis and hoped that Mr. Xu would convey his expert insights to the authorities. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Associations Telegraphs the Executive Yuan to Not Renew the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>If Economic Severance Can Be Implemented</p>
<p>It Would Be Especially What the People Pray For</p>
<p>| Lin Kanghou States that Renewal Is Necessary but Must Be Revised |</p>
<p>Regarding the expiration of the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, the Municipal Associations telegraphed Song Dai, President of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, yesterday, stating: "The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty annex stipulates mutual benefit for a three-year term, which is about to expire. This kind of mutual benefit is harmful to us and beneficial to Japan, and should not exist in the first place. Even if Japan had not invaded and occupied our country's territory and undermined our sovereignty, there would be no need to extend or renegotiate it. Therefore, we especially telegraph, requesting that you follow public opinion, protect national interests, and instruct the competent authorities to clearly announce that the effect of the 'mutual benefit' provision in this annex shall end upon expiration, in order to curb their ambitions. If economic severance can be implemented, it would be especially what the people pray for. Respectfully requesting your consideration and implementation. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal Associations, Yu Yin."</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that regarding the renewal of the Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement, Lin Kanghou stated yesterday that the Sino-Japanese Customs Agreement is about to expire. Some parties advocate that it should not be renewed after expiration. However, in my humble opinion, before diplomatic relations between China and Japan are declared severed, it seems that renewal should proceed in fact. However, during renewal, all unequal points in it should be revised to the best of our ability. Some merchants in this city share this sentiment.</p>
<h3>All Circles Enthusiastically Support Saving the Nation Through Aviation</h3>
<p>Shop Employees, Police Officers, Children, and Chauffeurs Unite to Rise Up</p>
<p>Since leaders from all walks of life, as well as Mayor Wu and others, initiated the Save the Nation Through Aviation movement and established the China Aviation Association, people of all ages and genders across the country have enthusiastically supported it. Since children in this city, such as Fang Xiaoruo and others, saved their candy money and wrote to Mayor Wu to advocate for the creation of a "Children's Plane," children in various places have been enthusiastically donating. Recently, Mayor Wu has received letters from shop employees, police officers, and chauffeurs donating money and requesting the advocacy of purchasing planes such as "Youth Plane," "Shanghai Police Plane," and "Chauffeur Plane." This is deeply admirable. In the future, with the unified efforts and support of all circles, we will surely achieve ultimate success and victory. The original letters and the names of the children who donated to establish the Children's Plane are listed below separately.</p>
<p>Original Letters: 1. Mayor Wu, respectfully. At this time of deepening national crisis, the urgent task is to promote aviation in order to save the nation. It is not too late to catch up quickly. Recalling last year's violent Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the prosperous north was instantly reduced to ruins by aerial bombardment, a tragic and brutal scene that our people can never erase from their minds. I am currently a small shop employee and feel that I do not have much power, but I can save in various ways. I am attaching foreign dollars, which I ask you to accept and use to purchase a Youth Plane. I hope that young compatriots across the country will rise up and donate to create countless Youth Planes. China will be fortunate. Respectfully wishing you peace and achievement. Diao Chunling. 2. Mayor, respectfully reporting. Since you initiated the Save the Nation Through Aviation movement, people from various circles have responded one after another. What is particularly amazing is that the newspapers reported that children are saving money to buy planes to save the country. Reading this, I feel both shame and admiration. Thinking of this time of marital discord, I am ashamed of my inability to serve the country. With this thought in mind, tears fill my eyes. I am now setting aside five yuan from the hard-earned living expenses of my family to contribute to the promotion. I ask that you please accept it and also request that you order all police officers to donate fifty cents of their salary each month to buy planes to wipe out the shame (to recover the lost territories of the Northeast or until a full squadron is reached). I believe that my colleagues are enthusiastic and patriotic and will not want to lag behind others. Please name it "Shanghai Police Plane" and publish it in the Police Monthly to encourage and commemorate them. I humbly ask for your success in this small effort. Respectfully wishing you public prosperity, Attached foreign five yuan, Police Officer Liu Jicheng of the Fourth Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, weeping.</p>

<h3>The City Will Levy Land Value Tax</h3>
<p>Negotiations for Collection of Business Tax and Entertainment Tax in Concessions Are Still in Progress</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that, regarding the levy of land value tax, business tax, and entertainment tax in this city, the Central News Agency reporter visited Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, yesterday morning. Director Cai was too busy with official duties to receive the reporter in person, so he specifically appointed Shen Tong, Chief of the Third Section, to meet with the reporter. According to the interview,</p>
<p>Land Value Tax: The Municipal Finance and Land Bureaus, previously instructed by the Municipal Government to discuss the method of levying land tax, had submitted a reply, which was forwarded to the central government for review. The Ministries of Finance and Interior have approved it for record. However, the name of the land tax has been changed to land value tax. The Municipal Government has already received the relevant official letter from the two ministries. As for the collection area, it is planned to start in the South Shanghai and North Shanghai districts first, and the Pudong district will be temporarily delayed. In the future, the land value tax collection area will be exempt from field tax to avoid double taxation. Although the tax rate has not been determined, it will definitely not exceed 2.5 per mille. After the tax is collected, the municipal treasury revenue can increase by about one million yuan per year.</p>
<p>Business Tax: The Municipal Government has been preparing to levy business tax for a long time, but due to the obstruction from the concession side and the losses from the Shanghai war, it has not been levied yet. As for the reasons why the concession authorities are obstructing the levy of business tax in the concession, it is understood that they are using the Yangjingbang Regulations as an excuse, claiming that China cannot levy local taxes in the concession area in addition to national taxes. In addition, after the business tax is levied in the concession, it will inevitably affect the license tax levied by the concession authorities. Therefore, Director Cai has negotiated with the concession authorities several times, but no results have been achieved.</p>
<p>Entertainment Tax: Director Cai is also currently negotiating with the concession authorities regarding the levy of entertainment tax. It is expected that it will be levied in the shortest possible time. As for the monthly revenue of the city's finances, it is only more than 600,000 yuan, which is about 100,000 yuan less than before the war. The annual cost of the Municipal Security Office is more than 900,000 yuan, which is entirely borne by the Municipal Government. Given the empty state of the municipal treasury today, it is really overwhelming. Therefore, the Municipal Government has requested the Ministry of Finance for assistance, but no results have been obtained yet.</p>
<h3>Separate Reduction and Exemption of Land Rent in War Zones</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Approves Four Standard Measures</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that merchants and residents in the war zones of this city suffered extremely heavy losses in the January 28th Incident last year. Therefore, they petitioned the Municipal Government to reduce or exempt land rent. The Municipal Government immediately instructed the Land, Public Security, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus to jointly review and reply. The bureaus then dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys separately and decided to formulate four standard measures for reducing and exempting land rent in this city with reference to the standards for reducing and exempting house rent. The measures were submitted to the Municipal Government for review. The Municipal Government considered the measures to be fair and instructed the bureaus to handle them as proposed. The four bureaus then jointly issued a public notice to inform the public. The four measures are copied below: 1. For houses that have not been destroyed, land rent will be exempted for three months in accordance with the standards for reducing and exempting house rent. 2. For houses that have been destroyed but have now been restored or partially restored, land rent will be exempted for six months. 3. For houses that have been destroyed and not restored, but there is already a market nearby, land rent will be exempted for nine months. 4. For houses that have been destroyed and not restored, and the surrounding area has not yet been restored, land rent will be exempted for one year.</p>
<h3>Former US President Roosevelt's Wife Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chinese and American Officials Welcome Sincerely</p>
<p>Returned to the Original Ship Last Night to Return to the Country</p>
<p>The Dalu News reported that the wife of the late US President Roosevelt, and mother of the current Governor-General of the Philippines, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 6th) on the postal ship President Taft from Manila. She had passed through Shanghai a month ago to visit her son in Manila. When she arrived in port yesterday morning, the US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Kegel, and his wife, the US Attorney General in China, Mr. Panty, and his wife, as well as Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Mr. Donner, and others, went on a small steamboat to welcome her ashore. At noon, Attorney General Panty hosted a banquet at the US Consulate on Jiangxi Road. Among those attending the banquet were US Consul General Kegel and his wife. Former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and his wife were also present. In the afternoon, the lady went to various places to visit old posts. In the evening, Wu Chaoshu hosted a banquet. The lady reboarded the Taft this morning (the 7th) and departed for Seattle.</p>
<h3>Six Representatives of Local Associations Go North Today</h3>
<p>To Assist in Handling Relief Affairs</p>
<p>Local figures in Pingjin, in order to cope with the North China Incident, telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Local Associations, requesting them to send personnel to the north to assist. Yesterday, the Associations resolved to send Huang Renzhi, Mu Ouchu, Du Chongyuan, Yan Fuqing, Yang Zhixiong, and Hu Junzhuang to the north to assist in handling relief and rescue affairs. They also purchased a large quantity of absorbent cotton gauze and equipment from Wuzhou Pharmacy at low prices for application. Mr. Huang and his party are scheduled to depart today.</p>
<h3>Luo Yunyan's Advocacy on Drafting the Constitution</h3>
<p>"Freedom of Speech," "Freedom of Belief," and "Freedom of Assembly" Should All Be Vigorously Protected</p>
<p>The Shenshi Telegraph News Agency reported that Dr. Luo Yunyan, a member of the Legislative Yuan, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday for business. The reporter visited him at his residence and asked about the recent work of the Legislative Yuan and Mr. Luo's opinions on drafting the Constitution. He answered them one by one, which is recorded below. Reporter: You are a newly appointed member of the Legislative Yuan. What are your thoughts on the recent work of the Legislative Yuan? Luo: Since President Sun took office, the recent work of the Legislative Yuan has been quite intense. The members are also full of vigor. Although they are not elected by the people from various provinces, judging from the members' native places and their resumes, they can represent the interests of various provinces and circles and safeguard the interests of all aspects. This is fortunate for the Legislative Yuan and also a blessing for the party and the country. Reporter: The Constitution is the fundamental law of the country. Can we also hear your opinions on the drafting of the Constitution this time? Luo: The Constitution is the fundamental law of the country, as you said. Therefore, President Sun himself serves as the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee to show caution, and the members of the committee are all talented people with knowledge of both Chinese and Western cultures and rich experience. Once the meeting is convened to draft the Constitution, it will surely live up to the expectations of the people of the country. As for my own opinions on the drafting of the Constitution, I believe that the function of the Constitution is originally to guarantee civil rights and stipulate political power. Until recent times, the provisions of the state's social and economic organization have also been incorporated into various new constitutions. European and American constitutions mainly guarantee civil rights, such as the Magna Carta in England. The separation of powers in the US Constitution is a characteristic of the stipulation of political power. Recent constitutions with economic and social provisions, such as Russia, etc. As for the hard and soft nature of the constitution, each has its advantages and disadvantages, and they cannot be generalized. Furthermore, based on my past and present experiences, China's constitution-making should vigorously protect civil rights, especially freedom of speech and freedom of belief, which are inviolable rights of citizens. All rights to peaceful and unarmed assembly should also be protected. As for freedom of belief, it should also be stipulated that no laws shall be enacted to directly or indirectly promote any religion or prohibit any religion to restrict it.</p>
<h3>Shaw, Bernard Can Arrive in Shanghai on the 19th</h3>
<p>Telegrams Inquiring About the Safety of North China</p>
<p>The great writer Shaw, Bernard, is touring the world on the Changxing British Empress liner. He was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 17th, stay until the evening, and then travel with 240 members of the same ship's world tour group to Qinhuangdao and then to Beiping. According to confirmed news yesterday, Shaw has telegraphed friends in Shanghai to inquire about the recent situation in North China, and the British Empress liner has also telegraphed Changxing to inquire about the safety of North China. If Qinhuangdao is passable for commercial liners, the liner will arrive in Shanghai on the 17th. Otherwise, Shaw and others will stay in Manila and Hong Kong for two more days and travel to Guangzhou to see the birthplace of our revolution, and will arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 19th. At that time, they will terminate their trip to Ping and go directly from Shanghai to various parts of Japan.</p>
<h3>Sixth Meeting of the General Executive Committee of the Civil Rights Protection League</h3>
<p>The Provisional Executive Committee of the China Civil Rights Protection League held its sixth meeting on the afternoon of February 6th due to the large number of appeals received from various parties. The meeting was chaired by Cai Yuanpei and passed many important cases, which are recorded separately below. 1. Yang Xingfo, Secretary-General of the League, reported on the establishment of the Beiping branch and the situation of the League's representatives inspecting prisons in Ping, and forwarded the resolution of the General Meeting of the members of the branch in writing, namely, that the League advocates that the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Harming the Republic of China should be abolished immediately, and that all single laws that infringe on the rights of the people outside the criminal law should be abolished immediately, and requests the Executive Committee to work hard to achieve the goal. It was resolved to accept the resolution of the Ping Branch and to appoint experts to draft a protest letter based on legal facts. 2.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Singapore Donate Money to Help Northeastern Refugees</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, February 7th: The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice because refugees from the three northeastern provinces are entering the customs and are in dire straits, requesting that Overseas Chinese in Malaysia donate money to help them. The article mentions following in the footsteps of the Overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Vietnam to jointly support this righteous cause. Dozens of Chinese trading companies in Singapore have remitted money to Shanghai, either directly to the Northeast Relief Association or through the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>The Temporary Station of the Two-Roads Administration Is Scheduled to Be Completed in June</h3>
<p>The Entire Line of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Will Be Completed Within Five Years</p>
<p>The Administration Will Move into the Riverfront Building Next Month</p>
<p>The National Society reported that the Jinghu and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Administration has determined that the construction of the joint transportation hub in the Pengpu District, circled by the Ministry of Railways, is large-scale and cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore, there is a move to build a temporary station first. It is now learned that the station has already started construction. After it is completed and moved in, the current station will be sold entirely to rebuild roads and houses. At the same time, the Administration will also move its office next month, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is actively planning to connect the entire line. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Construction of the Temporary Station Begins</h3>
<p>The temporary station of the two railways is located in Song Park Road, west of the current station site. The base is owned by the Railway Bureau, adjacent to a part of the station, covering an area of more than 200 mu. All plans have been prepared and construction has now begun to fill the mud. In the future, it is planned to build a simple station house, six platforms, and eight railway lines. It is also planned to add a branch line through Pengpu to the Qiujiang Wharf in the city center to facilitate water and land transportation. It is scheduled to be completed by the end of June at a cost of approximately 110,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Old Station Is Sold to Build Houses and Roads</h3>
<p>After the temporary station is completed and moved in, the existing station site will be sold entirely (approximately 400 mu of land will be sold). All car houses and tracks will be demolished. A request has been made to the Municipal Public Works Bureau to connect the North Xizang Road, which is blocked by the current station, to connect the roads in Zhabei. The remaining land will be used to build municipal housing and prosper the city. If all is rebuilt in the future, the North Railway Station will become a historical term.</p>
<h3>The Administration Moves to the Riverfront Building</h3>
<p>The address of the Two-Roads Administration was moved to No. 6 Sichuan Road after the Shanghai War of January 28th. Then, in June of last year, it moved to No. 240 Bazilu to be closer to the station and more convenient. However, after Huang Boqiao became the Director, he realized that the subordinate offices were not in the same location. For example, the Accounting Office was on Yuanyuan Road, the Engineering Office was on Xinmin Road, and the Machinery Office was at the intersection of Bazilu. It took a lot of time to transmit official documents, which was extremely inconvenient. Therefore, he specifically found all of the second floor of the Riverfront Building near Tianhougong Bridge on North Suzhou Road as the Administration's address. All offices except the Transportation Office and the Hospital will be moved in. The Transportation Office and the Hospital will be moved to the current Administration's address. This move is scheduled to take place in March.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Completes the Entire Line</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway has been operating from Shanghai to Hangzhou for 309 kilometers, but the 280 miles from Hangzhou to Ningbo has not been completed, so it is difficult to develop business. Now that Huang Boqiao is the Director of the two railways, he is actively planning to complete the entire line.

<h3>The Northeastern Refugee Association Pleads for Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees issued an important announcement yesterday to solicit donations for the Northeastern refugees. The original text reads: "Since the fall of Yuguan and the emergency in Rehe, our Northeastern refugees have lost their homes and are running around, destitute and without support. The Association has repeatedly announced the details of the disaster and solicited donations for relief. Recently, Qu Wenli, a standing director of the Association, returned from relief efforts in Qinhuangdao and Rehe. According to reports, from Lengkou on the Rehe border to Baishi River on the coast to Luanzhou, for thousands of miles, the refugees have no clothes or food and are displaced. Some are even sleeping in the open or building shacks in the ground. The ice is cracking the ground, but fires cannot be lit. Everywhere, there are hundreds of people in groups. If relief is not continued urgently, not only will they starve to death and freeze to death, and their corpses and bones will be exposed, and their lives will be uneasy, but the pits and valleys will be full of dead bodies. There is no way to deploy military affairs," etc. It has been found that the Association's relief funds have been exhausted, but the national crisis has not ended, and the number of refugees is increasing sharply. Without the concerted efforts of the whole country, it is impossible to overcome the difficulties and reverse the catastrophe. I implore all compatriots from all walks of life to embody the virtue of heaven's love for life and to fulfill the necessity of human mutual assistance. No matter how big or small, the more the better. On behalf of tens of millions of refugees, I bow my head and ask for your help. Please, everyone."</p>
<h3>Method for Newspapers That Have Not Received Registration Certificates to Register and Execute Vouchers</h3>
<p>Approval for Local Party and Government Agencies to Send Letters of Certification Jointly</p>
<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Publication Law, post offices in various places have suspended the execution of vouchers for newspapers and magazines that have not received registration certificates and do not allow them to enjoy special preferential delivery privileges. This was originally a method for promoting the implementation of laws. However, the registration of newspapers and magazines is handled by local governments. Although newspapers in remote cities and counties have applied for registration in accordance with the law, due to the tedious procedures and time delays, those who have not been able to obtain registration certificates immediately have no way to present the registration documents. If all are not allowed to register and execute vouchers, it is not enough to show the difference. Recently, in order to support the newspaper industry, the Ministry of Interior has specified a flexible method to allow newspaper and magazine offices to apply to the relevant city and county governments and party headquarters to jointly send a letter of certification stating that a certain newspaper or magazine published by the office has applied for registration in accordance with the law on a certain date. Although the registration certificate has not yet been received, the registration procedures have been completed. Local post offices that receive this certification letter still treat it as proof of registration and allow registration and execution of vouchers. It is heard that this method has been communicated by the Ministry of Interior to the provincial and municipal governments for implementation by their subordinates.</p>

<h3>Suspicion Surrounding the Violent Death of an Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>A local woman, Chen Guan, residing at No. 12 Tanzi Bay, Zhabei, had no children of her own and adopted a twelve-year-old girl named Yunlan last year. However, as is common, an ordinary woman does not treat an adopted child as well as her own offspring. Therefore, the neighbors all had complaints. Unexpectedly, on the day before yesterday at six o'clock, the girl suddenly died. The neighbors reported it to the Fourth District Police Station, which dispatched police officers to investigate. Although Yunlan was lying face up on a board, there were many blue and red injuries on her head, indicating a suspicious death. Therefore, the police prevented the body from being placed in a coffin and ordered the neighborhood head, Zhang Fengqi, to report it to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Record of the Kwangtsi Steamer Maritime Police Defeating Pirates</h3>
<p>Maintaining Safe Navigation</p>
<p>The Bureau Awards Them</p>
<p>The Wenchow liner Kwangtsi recently encountered pirate ships outside Woosungkou. Fortunately, the ship's maritime police bravely fought back with gunfire, successfully repelling the pirate ships and ensuring the safety of the Kwangtsi. The officer in charge has submitted a request for commendation for the maritime police for their efforts. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Stopping at Yuhsingnao Due to Weather: The China Merchants Bureau's Kwangtsi steamer, en route from Shanghai to Wenchow, was heavily laden with cargo and passengers. After passing Yushan outside Woosungkou, the wind and waves grew fierce, accompanied by light snow. It was late at night when they reached the waters of Yuhsingnao. The waves were immense. For the safety of the voyage, the ship's master ordered the ship to anchor at Yuhsingnao, choosing a spot where the wind and waves were less severe.</p>
<p>Encountering Pirates at Huanghuashan: The next morning, after the sky cleared, the Kwangtsi resumed its journey from Yuhsingnao, heading directly for Wenchow. As it sailed near Huanghuashan, crew members spotted several pirate ships resembling fishing boats emerging from the islands of Huanghuashan, heading towards the Kwangtsi with the intent to rob it. The ship's master immediately increased speed and summoned the escort police officers from inside the ship. They quickly emerged from the cabins and gathered on deck, opening fire on the pirate ships.</p>
<p>Repelling the Pirate Ships: Caught by surprise, the pirate ships were unable to approach due to the concentrated fire from the Kwangtsi's maritime police. After a considerable time, the pirates, realizing they were outmatched and fearing a distress call would bring warships, making escape impossible, turned around and fled into the straits near Huanghuashan. The Kwangtsi was able to escape danger, and the passengers, their fright subsided, arrived safely at Wenchow.</p>
<p>Officer Requests Award: The Kwangtsi returned to Shanghai from Wenchow on the fourth of this month. After arriving at the port, the maritime police reported the details of the encounter and the repelling of the pirates to the officer in charge of the maritime police team, Kao Tien-chen, at the bureau.

<h3>Retrial of the Ming Garden Racecourse Lawsuit Against the Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chief Inspector and Chairman</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden Attends the Hearing</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Initially Approved the Establishment of Ming Garden</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered the closure of the dog racing tracks in the Settlement in the spring of the year before last, the dog racing association that operated the Ming Garden racecourse sued Martin, the acting Chief Inspector at the time, and Macnaghten, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, in the British Supreme Court, seeking damages of 2.5 million taels. The British judge dismissed the case. The plaintiffs appealed. Last year, the Court of Appeal overturned the original verdict and ordered a retrial. Sir Grain, the British Supreme Court judge, opened the hearing at 10:00 AM yesterday, selecting five jurors, including Taikester. Many Westerners in the city attended the hearing due to the case's impact on the Municipal Council's authority. Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden was also present. After the opening of the hearing, the plaintiff's lawyer, Harris, read the statement of claim as customary. After reading each section, he read the defendant's defense for reference and stated that the case involved the defendant exercising power under the Municipal Council to obstruct the plaintiff's activities, causing damages to the plaintiff. He further stated that most of the facts presented by the plaintiff had been admitted by the defendant. The statement of claim stated that the plaintiff's legal counsel wrote to the Municipal Council on August 12, 1927, stating the intention to establish a dog racing track in Shanghai, and received a reply from the Municipal Council on August 20, approving the action. However, the defendant's defense, while admitting the letter, denied it granted approval. The statement of claim further stated that the plaintiff repeatedly wrote to the Municipal Council at the time, stating the intention to lease land, build houses, and install machinery, incurring a total cost of 527,653.55 taels, plus 68,381 taels for building dog kennels, and 45,000 taels for setting up a dog breeding room. The defendant also admitted the existence of these letters but denied their content, claiming it was not an accurate description of the points in dispute. The statement of claim also stated that the plaintiff's dog racing association had leased the established dog racing track to the dog racing association. Around 1928 or 1929, the Municipal Council built a road for spectators to walk to the dog races. Later, the Municipal Council limited the dog races to one night per week, threatening to withdraw police protection otherwise. Subsequently, on January 1, 1931, the Municipal Council sent a letter to the association, notifying it that after the end of March of that year, dog racing would no longer be permitted at the dog racing track. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that regarding the order to close, the defendant Martin's defense claimed that he was acting on instructions from the Municipal Council and that he dispatched police to block the road leading to the dog racing track, preventing outsiders from entering. He also stated that the Municipal Council was not subject to the jurisdiction of the British Supreme Court. The defendant Macnaghten's defense stated that he was unaware of Martin's actions beforehand, but he believed they were not wrong, and that the Municipal Council was authorized by the Land Regulations to take all necessary steps to handle municipal affairs. After the plaintiff's lawyer finished reading the statement of claim, he described in detail to the jurors the closure of the road, the forced suspension of the races, and the previous events, as well as the correspondence between the plaintiff and the Municipal Council. The hearing adjourned at noon and will continue in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Trial of Traitor Yao Lan-sheng to Commence Today</h3>
<p>Colluded with Japanese Troops Last Year</p>
<p>Murdered Standing Committee Member of Party Headquarters</p>
<p>国民社 reports that Li Ming-te (also known as Chin Ken), a resident of 79 Li Chia-chai, Paoshan County, formerly an employee of a Japanese-owned shoe store in Hongkew, and Yao Lan-sheng (38 years old), a worker at the Japanese-owned Huafeng Cotton Mill in Wusong Yunzaobang, colluded with Japanese troops when they invaded Wusong last year on January 28. They acted as accomplices, harming the people. On the afternoon of March 30 last year, at 7:00 PM, they incited more than ten armed Japanese soldiers to go to 66 (now 80) Hsian Road, Yunzaobang, and arrested Pu Heng-ching, a standing committee member of the third branch of the eighth district of the city party headquarters and a member of the district's defense force, without any explanation, tying him up with ropes and taking him to the Huafeng Cotton Mill. Subsequently, one of the five people managed to escape and learned that Pu Heng-ching had been killed by the Japanese. At the time, the eighth district party headquarters reported the case to the city party headquarters, confirming that the two criminals, Yao and Li, had colluded with the Japanese, spying for the enemy, and cruelly murdering the people, acts of rebellion. They requested the city government to arrest and punish the criminals promptly to uphold the law and avenge the wrongful death. Subsequently, the city government secretly ordered the city's public security bureau to conduct a thorough investigation. Yao Lan-sheng was arrested a few days ago. After interrogation by the bureau, the facts were clear, and a report with Yao's confession was submitted to the Sung-Hu Garrison Headquarters for legal action. Commander Dai examined the confession and handed it over to the military tribunal for strict handling. The trial is scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM today (the 8th). Pu's family has received a summons and will go to the headquarters to confront him.</p>
<h3>Murdered Male Corpse Found in a Dry Well in Paotaiwan</h3>
<p>Naked with a Large Stone on the Back</p>
<p>A Hemp Rope Tied Around the Neck</p>
<p>The corpse of a murdered man was found in a dry well near Pu Chia-kang, Teng 39 Tu, Paotaiwan, Wusong, the day before yesterday. After the patrol police officer Liang Kuo-fu and others from the seventh district police station arrived at the scene, they managed to pull the corpse out of the well. Upon closer inspection, the corpse was already decomposed and naked, with a hemp rope tied around the neck, hands and feet bound, and a large stone weighing over forty catties on its back. It was clear that the man had been murdered and thrown into the well to cover up the crime. It was later discovered that the man's name was Chu Wen-hsien, 32 years old, from Hsü-ch'ien, who worked as a rickshaw puller and lived in Wang Feng-kao's house behind the Kwangtung Kuan-yin Temple. He was known as Chu Ma-tzu in the area. His wife, surnamed someone, was younger and had run away several times, but had been found and brought back. This time, Chu was murdered, and his wife is suspected. The landlord, Wang Feng-kao, is also suspected by the police. Therefore, Wang has been detained. Yesterday, the Tu-Ti Pao, Pu Yu-sheng, went to the Shanghai District Court to request an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Three Kidnappers Who Shot and Killed Fang Chin-hung Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Hsi Tang and Wu Receive Life Sentences</p>
<p>The Remaining Four Bandits Sentenced to Over Ten Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Fang Chin-hung, a Cantonese and Director of the Purchasing Department of the Sincere Company, was shot and killed on the evening of December 9 last year at 8:45 PM, after finishing work and returning home by tram. When the tram reached Yu Yuen Road in the West of Shanghai and he alighted, as he walked to the entrance of the Lian An Lane, he suddenly encountered several kidnappers who produced handguns to intimidate him, intending to force Fang into a car. However, Fang resisted and shouted for help. The gang, in a panic, fired several shots and fled. Fang was hit in a vital area and died immediately. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Detective Bureau arrested ten kidnappers in the case: Chang Chi-shan, Hsi Hou-tao, Ting Yu-nan, Tang Jung-tsung, Yu A-fu, Tang Jung-fu, Chang A-erh, Wu A-erh, and Chien Heng-hsiao. It was also investigated that this group was involved in the kidnapping of Teng Chung-ho, owner of the Ta Ching Cloth Store on Ningpo Road, and wealthy merchant Liu Tung-sheng. They were sent to the First Special District Court. The court has now completed repeated hearings and set a date for sentencing, as reported in detail in the newspaper.

<h3>Eighty Gambling Offenders Arrested in a Commercial Hotel</h3>
<p>Tense Atmosphere in Court</p>
<p>Three People Involved in Theft Cases</p>
<p>The Rest Are Released with a Ten Dollar Fine</p>
<p>Recently, many large hotels have taken advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday to allow gamblers to rent rooms for gambling, day and night, skimming profits. Although military and police authorities have conducted strict investigations, the general public remains undeterred. In hotels in the Public Settlement, there is almost no hotel without a gambling den. The rooms opened for gambling in the Commercial Hotel on Avenue Edward VII are particularly numerous. The day before yesterday at noon, due to the confession of Wang Sheng-yu and others, suspects in a theft case, that their accomplice, Tung A-mao, was hiding in Room 169 of the Commercial Hotel, Central and Western detectives Ji Tsun-yi, Phillip, and Chinese detective Yang Yun-feng went to the address to make the arrest. Upon arriving at the hotel, they saw many people entering and exiting rooms 106, 119, 143, 146, 152, and 169. They immediately investigated each room and discovered that all six rooms were gambling dens. Some were playing Pai Gow, others were playing mahjong, dicing, or playing "shake the pot," with a great many activities taking place. Shouting and revelry were heard everywhere. The detectives arrested all the gamblers in each room, without exception, totaling eighty people, along with the gambling paraphernalia, and brought them to the police station. The so-called Chou A-mao was also among the gamblers. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Liu Yu-kuei, who was presiding over the case, originally scheduled the trial in the Eighth Court, but temporarily felt that the number of offenders was too large, and the court was too small to accommodate them. Therefore, he temporarily borrowed the First Criminal Court of the Second Higher Court to hear the case. The atmosphere in the court became tense. After the detectives lined up the offenders by name, Judge Liu began the trial. First, the police lawyer, Chang Shih-chu, described the details of the case. Then, after examining each person individually, he learned that Chou A-mao, Chou Chih-ho, and Chen Te-fu were all involved in theft cases and ordered them to remain in custody. The remaining seventy-seven gamblers were each fined ten dollars as a warning, and the gambling paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Inland Waterways Steamer Services Resume</h3>
<p>The Tai Sheng-chang, China Merchants, Tai Tung, Lao Kung-mao, and other small steamers that operate on inland waterways from the North Soochow Road wharf have all been suspended because of the two recent freezes that blocked the waterways. Now, after another ten days, with the weather turning warmer and the inland waterways melting, the steamers operating on the Soo-Chang, Hu-Chang, Kun-Chang, Hu-Hsi, and Hu-Chang routes all resumed their regular services the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Officials Arrest Innocent People Without Cause</h3>
<p>Wang Ching-fu Jumps Aboard the Ship</p>
<p>Wang Fu-shun Reports to the Authorities</p>
<p>Wang Fu-shun, a ship owner, usually travels between Shanghai and Shantung, specializing in loading passengers and cargo, or going offshore for fishing, as a means of livelihood. Last winter, Wang loaded a large quantity of salted pork from Shantung Province to Shanghai, selling it to the Bao-feng-hang. After finishing business, he set off to return to Shantung on the fifth of this month. Unexpectedly, when the ship reached the Woosung estuary, at about 2:00 PM, Wang Ching-fu, who claimed to be a detective in the fourth district of the Kiangsu Provincial Maritime Police Force, and his accomplices, including Chin Hung-chen, jumped aboard Wang Fu-shun's ship, without any explanation, took the ship's captain, Kao Wei-sung, to the district. Wang Fu-shun, seeing that Kao had been arrested for no reason, fearing serious consequences, immediately reported the situation to the fourth squadron of the Municipal Police Bureau's maritime patrol, requesting an investigation. Inspector Li of the squadron immediately ordered detectives Chen Po-liang and Ma Chin-chang to rush to the office of the fourth district of the Kiangsu Provincial Maritime Police Force in Woosung to negotiate. Kao Wei-sung was brought back to the squadron and transferred to the South City Headquarters. During the preliminary hearing by the squadron leader, Kao Wei-sung stated that he was 44 years old, from Jih-chao, and had been working as a captain on Wang Fu-shun's Shantung ship. He had always been law-abiding and had never committed any crimes. He never expected to be suddenly taken off the ship by Wang Ching-fu and others and taken to the fourth district of the Kiangsu Provincial Maritime Police Force, who falsely accused him of kidnapping and forced him to hand over 1,500 yuan in silver dollars in order to return to the ship, otherwise his life would be in danger. Although he was subjected to all kinds of intimidation, he remained calm, knowing that he had never been involved in kidnapping. He was detained for a day and a night. Fortunately, Wang Fu-shun reported to your squadron, and you sent officers to negotiate, which led to his release. He requested an investigation. He was ordered to return to the ship, and an order was issued to arrest Wang Ching-fu and others for questioning. Subsequently, at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Maritime Patrol detectives Chen and others discovered Wang Ching-fu and others sipping tea at the Chun Tsai Tea House on the Sixteenth Pier. They reported to the squadron leader, who dispatched police and brought Kao Wei-sung to the Chun Tsai Tea House, where Wang Ching-fu and Chin Hung-chen were arrested and brought to the squadron for a preliminary hearing. Wang Ching-fu, when questioned, stated that he was 46 years old, from Chiangyin, and had been working as a detective in the Kiangsu Su-Chang Pacification District Command. His remaining statements were vague. Chin Hung-chen stated that he was 52 years old, from Jih-chao, and had been working as a detective in the fourth district of the Kiangsu Provincial Maritime Police Force. His remaining statements were evasive. Wang and others, as public officials, dared to arrest innocent people privately, which was extremely illegal. An order was issued to prepare a report to be sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Tsingpu Steamer Out of Danger</h3>
<p>The Tsingpu steamer of the Sanpeh Company ran aground at Prince Islet in Anking. The tugboat failed to tow it out, as reported in yesterday's newspaper.

<h3>Lichuan Steamer Robbed</h3>
<p>Lake Bandits Pose as Passengers</p>
<p>Crew Members Injured</p>
<p>The Lichuan steamer, an inland river steamer of the China Merchants Inland Navigation Company, which travels between Shanghai, Soochow and Hangchow, departed from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the fourth, towing the company's boat, carrying passengers and goods. The following day (the 5th), upon arriving in Soochow, at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the steamer towed the Chingli Company's boat, fully loaded with over fifty Hangchow passengers and goods, as well as towing a pig boat, departing from Soochow and heading towards Tuichiao in Wuchiang County. Unexpectedly, nine lake bandits were mixed among the passengers. They produced firearms, with some bandits watching the helmsman and crew members, while the remaining bandits searched all the passengers in turn. After about half an hour, they gathered the silver dollars and clothing they had taken, totaling over two hundred yuan, tied them into bundles, jumped onto the pig boat being towed behind, cut the tow rope, forced the crew on the pig boat to go ashore, and fled. In this incident, the loss of clothing and other items stolen from the passengers was worth about three or four hundred yuan, combined with the over two hundred yuan in silver dollars, for a total of about six hundred yuan. Fortunately, the bandits did not open fire and injure anyone. Only one passenger, an employee of a hotel in Hangchow, who had been ordered by the hotel owner to collect debts in Soochow, collecting cash amounting to one hundred and fifty yuan, was searched by the bandits. When the employee resisted, he was beaten with guns by the bandits, resulting in injuries to both hands, shoulders, and back. As a result, all the debts he collected were robbed.</p>

<p>Chiu Fu Company Still Wins the Lawsuit</p>
<p>The case between the American-owned Parke, Davis &amp; Company and Chiu Fu Company over the Bulito trademark for medicinal products has been ongoing for quite some time. After three trials, a final judgment was reached, stating that Chiu Fu Company's Bulito medicinal products were not counterfeit. Recently, Parke, Davis &amp; Company, seeing that Bulito was selling widely, again claimed that the pronunciation of the name Bulito was similar to the trademark of their product, Paleto, and hired four lawyers, including A. Allemann and Yih, Chang, Yang, to apply to the First Special District Court for a preliminary injunction against Bulito. The court approved the enforcement of the injunction. Chiu Fu Company then hired lawyer Tan Yi-kung to file an appeal according to the law. It is now heard that the appellate court has ruled to overturn the original ruling, reject Parke, Davis &amp; Company's application for a preliminary injunction, and that Parke, Davis &amp; Company will bear the costs of the appeal and the application. As a result, Chiu Fu Company still wins the lawsuit.</p>

<h3>Truth About the Gambling Den Raided on Avenue Haig</h3>
<p>A report in the newspaper the other day stated that two gambling dens on Avenue Haig in the French Concession were raided. The report mentioned that Chu Chao-sheng and others were operating a gambling den at 48 Haig Court, Avenue Haig. This is not true. Chu Chao-sheng is a legitimate businessman who operates real estate and has never operated a gambling den. 48 Haig Court is a club jointly established by Chu and his friends for recreation in their spare time. As for the gambling den raided at 55 Hsiao Yu Li, Avenue Haig, Hsu Chia-hui, as reported, it was operated by Hu Mao-kou (also known as Big Mao-kou). However, Hu and others believe that Chu was the one who caused the trouble, which is not true.</p>
<h3>Chao Yen-ju, Who Solicits Funds for Pleasure, Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Chao Yen-ju, a native of Anhwei, using the name of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team, forged donation forms and seals, privately printed cards, and fraudulently solicited donations from businesses and residents in the various Chinese-administered areas of the city, obtaining hundreds of yuan. He spent the money on prostitution at the brothel of prostitute Chen on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. On January 23, while staying at the Ta Le Hotel at 6 Hung Yuan Lane, Hua Te Road, he planned to go to Soochow to commit similar fraud. Hua Detective Hao Yi-ku of the Yu Lin Road police station discovered the plan and secretly arrested Chao, along with the suspect Kao Hsien-chang and a suitcase, cards, and seals. They were taken to the First Special District Court. After repeated hearings, Judge Hsiao Hsueh-fen took the bench at the Third Criminal Court yesterday morning and announced the verdict. Chao Yen-ju was sentenced to five years imprisonment as a habitual fraud offender and fined 500 yuan. If he defaults on the fine, he will be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. The five donation books seized, as well as one hundred name cards of the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Team, four silver coins, nine copper coins, and one suitcase, are all confiscated. Kao Hsien-chang was found not guilty and released in court. The police lawyer declared that he would waive the right to appeal.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Fireplace Sound in the Vicinity of Radio Station</h3>
<p>According to a letter received yesterday from Mr. Hsu Chih-fang, "Esteemed Editor, I am writing to you with regards to the news article 'New Discovery of Radio Receiver' published in your newspaper, which stated that a fireplace six or seven feet away from the Wusih Science Museum Radio Broadcasting Station emitted a clear sound like a radio during broadcasting. This phenomenon is due to the induction effect of acoustic frequency in electrical science. Because the fireplace is made of iron, it is easily connected to the acoustic rate choke coil and acoustic rate square canopy of the broadcasting station. Sometimes, all ferrous objects near the broadcasting station, even a tiny nail, can emit sound. This is not the effect of high-frequency electrical detection. I fear that comrades in the country may think there is a possibility of further research and go astray. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper in the hope that you will publish it. Respectfully, Hsu Chih-fang, February 7."</p>
<h3>Obituary of Mr. Xiao Xinan, Who Was Humiliated on a Dutch Ship</h3>
<p>Self-Immolation with Gasoline in the Still of the Night</p>
<p>Despair in Life Cited as Reason for Suicide</p>
<p>Two years ago, a sensational incident occurred on the Dutch ship "Tjibaet." Readers who have not forgotten may still remember the name Xiao Xinan from Yixing. Ms. Xiao was a teacher at the Peide School in Ambon, Dutch East Indies. Recently, due to salary cuts, she suddenly committed suicide. Yesterday, a letter from Ambon reported the news of Ms. Xiao's death. A summary is provided below. (The preceding portion is omitted.) What is reported here is not Ms. Xiao's life circumstances, but rather her death. As a helpless woman, she sought a livelihood but met a tragic end in a foreign land, truly a heartbreaking event. It is reported that the funds of Peide School were originally ample. However, due to poor management, the funds were not deposited in a bank but entrusted to several fixed directors. Influenced by private commercial interests and other factors, the enormous sum of thousands of guilders vanished, leading to the current impoverished situation and the inevitable measure of salary cuts. Logically, in today's world, where economic recession is raging, layoffs and salary reductions have become common. It would have been understandable for the school to reduce teachers' salaries, but the treatment was unfair. Some had their salaries reduced by ten guilders, some by twenty, and some by forty, while Ms. Xiao's salary was reduced by more than half. Ms. Xiao's monthly salary was one hundred and forty guilders, but now it was reduced to sixty. How could she maintain her livelihood? Therefore, after receiving the notification, Ms. Xiao was extremely indignant. She lamented her own wandering life and felt the pressure of the present circumstances. Consequently, at twelve o'clock at night, she doused herself with gasoline and set herself on fire. At the time of the incident, the school janitor was still awake. Hearing cries of pain, he rushed to investigate and poured water on her to extinguish the flames. After the fire was extinguished, Ms. Xiao was still able to speak, but her injuries were too severe to recover. She was taken to the hospital but passed away at four o'clock. Before committing suicide, she wrote more than ten letters of farewell to relatives and friends in various places, reporting her reasons for feeling despair in life and having to commit suicide. It is said that she still had an elderly mother at home. When she hears the tragic news of her beloved daughter's death in a foreign land, one cannot imagine how grief-stricken she will be.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the news column of February 7, which contained a telegram from Geng Jizhou, commander of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, stating that the army was replacing its representative and declaring that Yang Yijie had come to Shanghai in secret to engage in sabotage, and that Cao Fengchun had been instructed to publish in Shanghai that everything related to Yang had nothing to do with the army, and that I had been appointed as the resident representative in Shanghai, I was quite surprised. Now that I have been in Shanghai for several days, and after thorough investigation by various parties, it is confirmed that Cao Fengchun, in addition to the commander's telegram clarifying the denial of any such matter, is still responsible for handling the army's request for assistance. Currently, the announcements and the telegram are all forged, and our commander is completely unaware of them. In addition to submitting an official letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, I am specially requesting your newspaper to make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Geng Chongde, son of Geng Jizhou, commander of the Fourth Route of the Liaoning Volunteer Army, February 7.</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Yesterday (February 7), your newspaper's fourth page published a news article titled "Xu Peihuang Discusses the Results of the Shanghai West Concession Affairs Meeting." The section "Cross-Border Telephone Calls" at the end is not consistent with the facts. It is verified that Director Xu spoke to a reporter from the news agency the other day about the temporary contract for telephone calls in the Chinese-controlled area, stating in essence that the contract had not yet been fully agreed upon by the French Concession's Board of Directors, so it was difficult to sign it for the time being. However, this contract is related to the interests of municipal transportation and many aspects of the residents' lives. It is hoped that the Concession authorities can prioritize the interests of the public so that it can be resolved as soon as possible. As for the statements in that section, "It is still necessary to submit to the Public Concession authorities for review and research" and "It is hoped that foreign merchants will abandon their profit-seeking goals," Director Xu did not say this. This letter is specially written to inform you and request that you verify and correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely, First Section, Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, Republic of China, February 7, 1933.</p>

<h3>How to Achieve Local Self-Government?</h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Lu Jingming</p>
<p>Reports indicate that most counties in Jiangsu Province have completed the election of neighborhood chiefs. However, the establishment of a local self-government system does not necessarily mean that local self-government is truly established. The true self-government of a locality requires economic and cultural development to a considerable stage before it can succeed. Local self-government created by laws and regulations is merely a formality and a waste of effort. China was originally a large agricultural society, so local self-government should start from the countryside. This is a consensus. Currently, many educators and experts in various places are successively rising up to study and experiment in this area, which is a glimmer of hope for the future of rural governance. Speaking of the methods of rural governance, the principle of selecting local talent must be followed in terms of people; and the principle of local wealth and future self-funding must be followed in terms of money. However, most of the people engaged in this movement in various places are hired from outside, and education and other matters are also funded from outside. Although there are some achievements and effects from doing this with spirit and substance, unfortunately, they are gradually moving towards the path of building new village model villages! Even if there are results, the results are not what they should be! Mr. Liang Shuming has two criticisms of this kind of mistake: (1) Using the same methods as running schools to increase rural wealth, I am afraid it will be too trivial. If industry cannot be developed, then other problems cannot be solved; if the problem of poverty is not solved, then the problem of backwardness cannot be solved. In other words, industry must develop before culture can be improved. If you only focus on education and culture, you will inevitably waste your efforts! (2) Using the methods of running education to carry out rural improvement movements will inevitably lead to a path where talent and money are all subsidized. Given the size of the country and the number of hundreds of thousands of rural villages, where will the people and money come from in the future? If you say that after completing one place, you will do another place, and hope that others will rise up when they hear about it, I am afraid that the fate of the Chinese nation cannot wait that long! I think that the problems pointed out by Mr. Liang have also been considered by general scholars. However, if we don't do this, what else can we do? Are there any other brilliant methods? This matter concerns the great plan of national construction, please contribute your opinions!</p>
<p>Answer: The letter raises the question of "local self-government," which is quite interesting. It is solemnly raised in this column for readers to express their views and discuss it. The reporter will first briefly contribute his thoughts on the points raised in the letter, so as to seek advice from you and the readers. (1) You said: "The establishment of a local self-government system does not necessarily mean that local self-government is truly established... It is merely a formality and a waste of effort." This statement, on the surface, seems much better than the general blind call for local self-government, but in reality, it lacks clarity. It is true that the "local self-government system" is one thing, and true local self-government is another; "The establishment of a local self-government system does not necessarily mean that local self-government is truly established" is correct. However, one must ask: What counts as "true local self-government"? Then your answer, "The true self-government of a locality requires economic and cultural development to a considerable stage before it can succeed," is insufficient. Not only is it insufficient, but it is also "beating around the bush," and not only is it "beating around the bush" but it is also "like comparing a donkey's lips to a horse's mouth." Why? Because you first did not clarify the content of the term "local self-government," at least not its modern meaning. Originally, the term itself is very clear. Local self-government means that local people themselves manage the affairs of their own locality, without interference from higher-level government offices, such as the so-called provincial government, county government, etc., and even the central government. Localities that have "economic and cultural development to a considerable stage" should, of course, have self-government, and localities where economic and cultural development has not yet reached a considerable stage should also have 100% local self-government. What you call "must have economic and cultural development to a considerable stage before it can succeed" is really surrounded by the traditional atmosphere of the current political and social relations. Imperialists say to the colonies they have plundered, your economy and culture have not yet developed to a certain level, and you cannot get rid of my rule; once your economy and culture have developed to a considerable level, we will allow you to have self-government or independence; you say: "Must have economic and cultural development to a considerable stage before it can succeed," which is tantamount to saying to a large group of people who demand self-government: Your cultural level is too low. Like children, you cannot act independently and must be supported by your parents. Once your cultural level reaches a considerable stage, you will be allowed to have self-government. This kind of self-government can be called self-government of a conservation policy, or self-government by favor; it can also be said to be nominal self-government monopolized by a few people, not the self-government with modern significance that we are talking about. How do you explain this? In the city, self-government by favor, or nominal self-government, is controlled by bureaucrats, warlords, bad gentry, and local bullies; in the countryside, it is controlled by large landowners, and bad gentry and local bullies. This kind of self-government oppresses the poor in the same way, and even the degree of oppression is deepened and the scope of oppression is expanded. However, the previously more secretive form has now been replaced by a public, or rather, "civilized" form. In terms of modern social relations, such self-government absolutely cannot solve the political and economic problems of the vast majority of people in a locality, that is, it is not true local self-government. Even if the roads are well-maintained, the parks are large, and there are many schools, and all the so-called public utilities are available, if we think about the actual interests and material and spiritual happiness of the vast majority of its residents, then we will know that all this so-called economy and culture has nothing to do with the vast majority of people in a certain locality. Therefore, we oppose this kind of false local self-government and advocate true local self-government. The basic conditions for so-called true local self-government are as follows: (1) The entire political power of the locality belongs to the vast majority of common people in the locality; (2) The exercise of local political power belongs to the local assembly directly elected by the vast majority of common people in the locality; (3) All local industries are owned by the vast majority of common people in the locality; (4) The children of all the vast majority of common people in the locality should be free from national education and higher primary education; and they should be equal in all other higher education; (5) The vast majority of common people have the unconditional freedom of association, assembly, speech, publication, and residence; (6) Abolish all exorbitant taxes, feudal corvée, and commercial lending; (7) The local assembly may, for the benefit and peace of the vast majority of residents of the locality, collect able-bodied men from the vast majority of residents to organize self-defense groups. If these conditions cannot be met, then local self-government is just a deceptive talk. You know: "Local self-government produced by laws and regulations is merely a formality and a waste of effort," but you have not stated how to obtain true local self-government that will not be a formality and a waste of effort. However, apart from the conditions we have listed above, what else is true local self-government? What do you think? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Britain Uses the Boxer Indemnity to Recruit Chinese Students</h3>
<p>Training in Mechanical Factories</p>
<p>Developing Sino-British Trade</p>
<p>Ms. Darrowane Has Come to Shanghai to Negotiate</p>
<p>London, Reuters, February 6 - The British Industries Confederation announced today that it is currently seeking to accept Chinese students in British mechanical factories because the Boxer Indemnity Foundation is able to allocate funds to provide technical training for Chinese students. It is reported that three years ago, after the British Economic Survey Mission conducted a survey of the Far East, a committee was organized to propose measures, believing that educating Chinese students under British influence could greatly benefit British industries. Now, the British Industries Confederation, in view of the fact that other countries have greatly benefited from training Chinese students, especially the United States, and in view of the decline of British trade with China in recent years, the gradual development of China's own industries, and the trend that China now procures the goods it needs itself, when announcing that British factories will accept Chinese students, it strongly advocated the need for this cooperation and joint effort, and said that the Chinese Boxer Indemnity Application Act of 1921 provides opportunities to gradually develop this kind of training convenience.</p>
<p>The China Press reports that Ms. Darrowane, the first student funded by the University of London's China Committee to travel to China, has arrived in Shanghai and is staying with her sister at 2 Difeng Road. The committee was formed last year and is related to the Boxer Indemnity. Its purpose is to increase all conveniences for Chinese students studying in the UK, and it is hoped that several British students will be selected to come to China. Ms. Darrowane's trip is specifically responsible for studying Chinese education issues. The lady's family is famous in the field of education. The lady has teaching experience in the country, studied at the London School of Economics, and received a master's degree from the University of Edinburgh. Recently, she traveled to Hong Kong and Guangzhou on the way. After a short stay in Shanghai, she plans to go to Nanjing, Hankou, Beijing, and other places. She is scheduled to return to the UK in two years to report on Chinese normal education issues to the University of London's China Committee and the Edinburgh University Committee. They hope to provide funding for twelve Chinese students to study in the UK each year, and are willing to appoint some suitable people in Shanghai to allocate this scholarship so that they can be realistic and achieve better understanding and closer relations between China and the UK.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Feat in Chinese Sports: Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team to Tour Europe and America</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Serves as Chairman of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>Aims to Promote National Spirit, Observe World Sports, and Connect</p>
<p>Women's Feelings Worldwide</p>
<p>The achievements of the Liangjiang Women's Sports Normal School have long been praised by the Chinese people, especially the performance of its basketball team, which is the most outstanding. Since the promotion of women's basketball games in Shanghai, Liangjiang has won continuously. Even Western women in Shanghai have conceded defeat. In the 19th year, they tied in Tianjin, and in the 20th year, they went on an expedition to Japan and Korea. They have toured dozens of times, and all of them returned triumphantly with honors. It is said that Liangjiang has brought a lot of glory to the country. Recently, it was heard that the school wants to conduct further research, so it has a plan to travel to Europe and the United States. A preparatory committee has been organized, currently chaired by Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who is in charge of everything. Preparations have already begun. The main purpose is to promote the national spirit, observe Western women's sports, and take this opportunity to connect women's feelings internationally and establish a foundation for world peace and unity. As for the strengths and weaknesses of technical comparisons, that is not what they are concerned with. However, the fact that the team can make this grand expedition across the ocean despite the hardships and open an unprecedented record in the Chinese sports world, and that Mayor Wu is enthusiastically preparing and sparing no effort, is all worthy of our admiration and glory. Now, let's explore the team's declaration as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Foreign aggression is imminent, and national disasters are rampant. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, the entire country is striving to resist strong enemies with iron and blood. However, our team is planning a tour to Europe and the United States. Some Chinese people may say that this is not the right time. Now, before we go abroad, please allow us to say a word to the Chinese people about the meaning of this trip.</p>
<p>A nation of strong physiques is the cornerstone of a country's life. A nation with strong physiques will inevitably lead its country to strength. A nation with weak physiques will inevitably be invaded by foreign races. The principle of "the survival of the fittest, the weak are prey to the strong" is very obvious. Although the physique of the Chinese people is not entirely inferior to that of foreigners, most of them are indulging in pleasure and becoming increasingly weak. Even if there are a few individuals or groups who are striving to invigorate themselves and are brave and精進 in sports, their achievements are not profound, and their physique is not strong. However, they have not taken the opportunity to show their achievements to the world and change the perception of our country in various countries. In the end, foreigners only see the weakness of the Chinese people and do not know that there are still strong people in the East. The shame of being a "sick man" has never been completely eradicated, and foreigners regard us as insultable and carry out their aggression. There are many reasons why our country has attracted foreign aggression, and the fact that we have fallen behind in sports is not the least of them. Therefore, advocating sports to save the country is the first meaning of this trip.</p>
<p>The Chinese people's neglect of sports is especially true of women. As a result of thousands of years of various constraints, their bodies have become pathological. Therefore, the main purpose of our establishment is to take the promotion of women's sports as our responsibility. In the past twelve years, we have been fortunate enough to achieve some success in various sports facilities. In the second year of the two years, our team went to Japan for an expedition, marking the beginning of Chinese women's sports showing their talent to the world. Although we won the unique position in East Asia as a result, there are many foreign sports that can be learned from, so we cannot be complacent. To complete our country's plan to improve sports, we must adopt the essence of sports from various countries in the world to promote progress. Therefore, observing world sports is another meaning of this trip.</p>
<p>The foundation of world peace lies in the friendship between international countries. The connection between international countries especially requires the harmony of national feelings in various countries. This is why national diplomacy and governmental diplomacy are equally important. The current world is full of war opportunities. The people of our country are a nation that loves peace very much. We should take responsibility for all mankind in a timely manner. Moreover, in future wars, our country will bear the brunt. For the sake of our own safety, we should also do our best to advocate peace. However, when the violent enemy is in front of us, we have no choice but to go forward. It is inevitable that we will fall to the ground and bleed. However, the union of friendly countries and the joint sanctions against the brutal perpetrators who destroy world peace are also something that the people cannot but work on. Therefore, connecting national feelings in various countries and advocating world peace is another meaning of this trip.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation after the revolution is showing a vigorous vitality, and the women of our country after liberation are especially different from the past. The people of various countries are limited to the prejudices of decades ago and still think that the women of our country are still in the era of deep boudoirs and bound feet. In order to make the world understand the progress of our country and recognize the nations of the East that are about to revive, our team plans to visit various countries and see their sports facilities. Before that, we will compare our hard-won skills with the women of the world to show the new spirit of our nation after the revolution and let them know that the women of our country are no longer willing to be mediocre and want to show themselves in the world women's competition. As for the calculation of victory or defeat, that is not what we are concerned with. If this can arouse the general attention of the people to sports and make the world know that there are also women in China who are striving for sports, then this trip of our team will not be in vain.</p>
<h3>Badminton Rules and Methods (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai participated in the Shanghai Badminton Championship, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Because the people of our country do not know much about this kind of competition, the rules will be translated later. Badminton is similar to tennis, but the ball is small and has feathers on it. It cannot land during the game, and landing means failure. The shots are like tennis. There are doubles and singles. The net is higher than a tennis net. If the server fails, they lose the right to serve but do not lose a point. If the receiver fails, the server gets a point. The winner of a game is determined by a score of 15 or 21 points. The winner of a match is determined by winning two out of three games or two out of five games. It is extremely skillful, and may be better than tennis. The complete rules of badminton are translated below.</p>
<p>(1) Court</p>
<p>(1) The court is drawn with clear white or black lines that are 1.5 inches wide.</p>
<p>(2) The net should be made of high-quality leather thread with square holes that are less than three-quarters of an inch. It should be positioned at the net posts and can be 17 to 24 feet long and 2 feet 6 inches high. The center of the net should be 5 feet from top to bottom, and 5 feet 1 inch at the posts. The top of the net should be edged with a 3-inch wide white border, and then a strap should be threaded through it and tightened on top of the posts so that it is level with the posts.</p>
<p>(3) The net posts must be 5 feet 1 inch high and very strong so that the net can be tightened.</p>
<p>(4) The weight of the badminton must be between 73 and 85 grams, and it must have 14 to 16 feathers firmly inserted into a cork that is 1 and 1/8 inches in diameter. The feathers must be between 2 and 1/2 inches and 2 and 3/4 inches long, and the spread at the top of the ball must be between 1 and 1/8 inches and 1 and 1/2 inches. They must be firmly inserted and connected and tightened with a line on the cork for about 1 inch.</p>
<p>(Note) To be considered an accurate badminton, a player with average strength must use a tight racket to hit it upwards with all their strength from behind the boundary line parallel to the side line, with an angle of about 45 degrees. The ball must land within 2 feet 6 inches of the rear boundary line of the opponent's court.</p>
<p>Single Court Double Court</p>
<p>(2) Doubles</p>
<p>(5) Each side of the match has two players.</p>
<p>(6) Choosing the Court: The winner of the coin toss gets to choose one of the following three items first: (A) Serve first, (B) Do not serve first, (C) Choose either end of the court. The loser of the coin toss gets to choose the remaining two items. The winner of a game gets to serve first in the next game, but in a doubles match, either player on the winning team can serve first.</p>
<p>(7) The winner of a game in a doubles match can be determined by 15 or 21 points. If the score is 13-13 in a 15-point game, the first side to reach 13 has the right to call "End," in which case the winner is determined by 5 points. If the score is 14-14, the first side to reach 14 has the right to call "End," and the winner is determined by 2 points. If "End" is called after a game, the score is 0-0. After calling a halt at 13 or 14, the first team to score 5 or 2 points wins this. In any case, after 13 or 14, "End" must be called before the next serve. Suppose the same method is adopted in a 11-point game, with 18 and 20 replacing 13 and 14 respectively.</p>
<p>(Note) It is not possible to call "End" in a handicap match.</p>
<p>(8) In a game to be determined by three games, the courts must be exchanged at the beginning of the second game, and the same is true for the third game. If the winner has to be determined by a third game, in the third game, if one side gets 8 points first in a 15-point game, or if one side gets 6 points first in a 11-point game, or if one side gets 11 points first in a 21-point game, or if one side gets half of the prescribed winning score in a handicap game (the second highest number is determined by decimals), the players must also exchange courts. In a singles match, the third game must also be exchanged, the same as in doubles.</p>
<p>(3) Fouls</p>
<p>(9) If any player on the serving side commits a foul, the right to serve is lost. If any player on the receiving side commits a foul, the serving side wins a point.</p>
<p>(10) The following are fouls:</p>
<p>(A) If the serve is overhand (the meaning of overhand is that the ball is higher than the server's waist when it is hit),</p>
<p>(B) If, when serving, the ball lands in the wrong half of the opponent's court (not the half of the court diagonally opposite the server) or lands before the front service line (the reporter presses for the horizontal line in front of the net) or the cross service line, or outside the boundary line of the half of the court that should be served,</p>
<p>(C) If, when serving, both feet of the server are not in the serving half of the court, or both feet of the receiver are not in the receiving half of the court until the ball is served,</p>
<p>(Note 1) The ball is served after the racket hits the ball.</p>
<p>(Note 2) If one foot is on the line when serving, it is out of bounds.</p>
<p>(D) If, when serving, the server's partner, in the referee's opinion, pretends to be deceptive beforehand or intentionally obstructs the opponent,</p>
<p>(E) If, when serving or playing, the ball lands out of bounds, or passes under the net, or does not pass over the net, or touches the top of the star or the wall or any player's body or clothing,</p>
<p>(Note) If the ball lands on the line, it is considered to have landed in the half of the court or court that is bounded by this line.</p>
<p>(F) If, during the game, the ball is hit before it comes over the net from the opponent, but the hitting side can use the racket to follow the ball over the net,</p>
<p>(Note) A ball is "in play" from the moment it is hit by the server's racket until it lands or touches someone or the player's body or clothing.</p>
<p>(G) If, during the game, a player touches the net or its accessories with their racket, body, or clothing,</p>
<p>(H) If the same player hits the ball twice in a row, or after one person on the same side hits it, their partner hits it again in a row, or the ball is not hit very clearly,</p>
<p>(I) If a player obstructs the opponent,</p>
<p>(J) If Article 15 of the rules is violated,</p>
<p>(4) Game</p>
<p>(11) After deciding which side serves first, the player on this side in the right half of the court starts serving to the player on the opposite side in the right half of the court. If this player hits it back without the ball landing, then any player on the serving side hits it back, and any player on the opposite side hits it back again until a foul is committed or the ball stops being "in play" (see note on foul). If the serving side commits a foul, they lose the right to serve. Because the serving side only has one serve, now the player on the opposite side in the right half of the court serves, but if the side that served first at this time cannot return or commits a foul, the serving side gets a point. The serving player on the serving side changes from the right half of the court to the left half of the court and serves to the player on the opposite side in the left half of the court. If one side gets the right to serve continuously, the score increases slightly, and the serving half of the court is also switched alternately. The first serve of any side in a game starts from the right half of the court. After the ball is served, the serving player and the receiving player can move freely and are not bound by the boundary line.</p>

<h3>Iron Birds…Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Airplanes were originally toys. They were first invented by the Portuguese in the 18th century. It was a balloon that used gas or hot air to rise into the sky, just like the bright lanterns that children release in the first month of the Chinese lunar year. Later, it was changed to an airship, such as the German Zeppelin airship, which was the most famous. Its function was only to carry passengers, and it was still in the nature of entertainment and games, and it was not used as a war weapon. Later, the manufacture of airplanes became light and fast, and they were used to detect enemies, drop bombs, and capture cities and territories. Their effectiveness was even greater than that of guns and cannons. The violent sun (Japan) is bullying China, but it relies on these few airplanes to show off its power! It is a pity that our country already had flying cars during the Shang Dynasty. In the Warring States period, Gong Lunzi made wooden kites to spy on the city of Song. Until now, not only has there been no progress, but even the flying cars and wooden kites of our own country only have their names and not their objects! However, bright lanterns and firecrackers are still colorful and decorate the New Year as children's toys.</p>
<p>The Japanese call airplanes "iron birds." Chen Jitang said that the Chinese navy is like "goldfish." It is really a wonderful pair. Our country suffered from the Japanese navy in the Sino-Japanese War. And it suffered from the Japanese air force again. After suffering from the Japanese navy, our navy still has not woken up, and it has turned into "goldfish." After suffering from the Japanese air force, we seem to have realized something. The call for air force propaganda is loud. I hope that our country's iron birds will increase day by day, and don't be like goldfish, with only a few paper kites in the sky, just as children's toys.</p>
<p>Compared with iron and gold, iron is of course cheaper than gold, but what is the use of "iron birds coming from Japan!" Maybe they will be goldfish in a pot, subject to being cooked and cut by others. I hope that the Chinese air force and navy will be revitalized in the future, and goldfish will be transformed into whales, and paper kites will be transformed into iron kites. Then, would the violent sun dare to bully us?</p>
<h3>Cold Words</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>As the weather turns cold, everyone curls up, wishing they could sleep through the night and wake up to find the thermometer already at 60 or 70 degrees. Wouldn't that be delightful? Cold weather is indeed dreadful. In reality, anything in this world, no matter what, that gets tainted with a bit of "coldness" never leads to good things.</p>
<p>For example, when someone earnestly tells you something, and you respond with a "cold laugh," it makes them feel extremely awkward. When two people are rolling up their sleeves, ready to fight and determine who is stronger, and you deliver a "cold punch," that is incredibly unethical. When someone is in a dangerous situation and you clearly have the ability to help, but you watch with "cold eyes" and offer no advice, that kind of intention is truly sinister. When someone is already feeling a great deal of pain, and you add insult to injury with "cold words," that is utterly despicable. When two generals clash, wielding broadswords, fighting on horseback and on foot for hundreds of rounds without a clear victor, and you shoot a "cold arrow," even if you win, you cannot be called a hero or considered mighty.</p>
<p>Another example: "The area in front of the door is desolate, with few carriages and horses." Such a scene is utterly bleak. "Cold pillow, cold quilt" – wandering strangers in a foreign land have likely all experienced this feeling. In the areas around Shanghai and Jiangsu, there is a saying, "icy water cold," used to describe a state of loneliness and isolation, like a "cold temple" with no incense smoke all year round, which is terribly pitiful. The pedantic teacher in a small village, leading a group of snot-nosed students reciting ancient texts, living such a life, is said to be "sitting on a cold bench." A bench is already no match for a sofa, and if the bench is "cold," one can imagine how unpleasant it must be. There is also a saying, "a warm face presses against a cold butt," which vividly describes the difficulty of seeking help from others, and its effectiveness lies entirely in the word "cold."</p>
<p>The most terrible and destructive thing in the world is the word "cold." It is said that there is no life on the moon because it "cooled down." The end of the Earth will also come from "cooling down." Therefore, I know that when people's hearts "cool down" to zero degrees, it is an auspicious day for national demise!</p>
<h3>The Past</h3>
<h3>The Past and Present of Baoshu Pagoda</h3>
<p>— Recorded and photographed by Zhou Yunting</p>
<p>The Baoshu Pagoda, like a beautiful woman, stands atop Baoshi Mountain by the West Lake, a place composed of gentle charm and radiance. Its spire, resembling a spring bamboo shoot, perpetually preserves the architectural beauty of ancient China. It was built by the King of Wuyue. Its old companion, the legendary Leifeng Pagoda, was unfortunately completely destroyed in 1924, leaving behind a pile of rubble for people to mourn. Now, because of years of disrepair, it is also in imminent danger, barely surviving. The city government, fearing repeating the "mistake of the past," is diverting the funds intended for rebuilding its old companion to repair it.</p>
<h3>Present</h3>
<h3>Peach Blossom Luck</h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>Doctor Wang is a fair-skinned man deeply versed in the study of medicine, especially gynecology and pediatrics. He has been practicing medicine for several years, his career is thriving, and he has saved countless lives.</p>
<p>Two years ago today, on an afternoon during the New Year, he and a friend went to the door of a blind fortune teller known for his accurate predictions. Encouraged by his companion, he went in to have his future predicted. After reporting his birth date and time, the blind man nodded, muttered, and counted on his fingers for a while, saying, "From the age of twenty-six to twenty-nine, you will have great peach blossom luck for these four years. You will definitely meet a woman, and you will lose a little money."</p>
<p>He said goodbye to the blind man and walked along the road, his companion laughing and congratulating him, "Congratulations! Congratulations! You'll meet a woman!" Hearing these words of praise, he seemed happy but also frightened.</p>
<p>When he returned home, fear ultimately overcame his joy. He thought: "Women are such terrible creatures! Ruin, bankruptcy, destroyed reputation, death, and even the downfall of cities and nations are all related to women." He also thought about his fair complexion, his wealthy family, his knowledge of gynecology, which meant he touched women's jade arms every day and smelled their perfume, and his reputation in pediatrics, which meant he was constantly in contact with the mothers or sisters of sick children. Thinking about these things and the peach blossom luck the blind man had mentioned, he became increasingly terrified. He felt that his property, career, body, and everything else would immediately be ruined by women.</p>
<p>He was terrified, and he wanted to overcome his fear. The only way to overcome his fear was to stay away from women. But in reality, he couldn't stay away from women. What else could he do? He would simply not look at them, pretend not to see them! In the past, when examining patients, he would face the woman sitting next to him, touch her jade wrist, observe her complexion, and ask about her condition, even asking about conditions she couldn't speak of to others. While writing the prescription, he would also turn his head to ask her about this and that. Now, he completely changed this examination method. He sat upright with a solemn expression. Although his fingers couldn't help but touch her jade wrist, his eyes dared not glimpse her complexion. Although he still asked about her condition, he dared not talk face-to-face. He only knew the woman's illness but didn't see the woman's face. Unless the woman was about the same age as his mother, he would never dare to look at her.</p>
<p>He feared peach blossom luck, he feared meeting a woman through peach blossom luck and losing his wealth, harming his body, and ruining his career. So, he was cautious, and he had been examining patients in this way for two years. He has had peach blossom luck for two years, and in two more years, the peach blossom luck will recede. He is preparing for a long-term resistance, preparing to use the spirit of the past two years to fight through the next two years. Novel</p>

<h3>A New Song of Support for the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Jian Pao</p>
<p>Seeing the news in the newspaper that Tianyi Film Company and Hwa</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Wireless Research Institute were jointly operating a broadcast radio station sparked my motivation to visit the company. I had never visited a film company or a broadcast station, and now that I had this two-in-one opportunity, how could I miss it?</p>
<p>Although the gate of the film company did not have a fierce tiger head sign that says "Restricted Area, No Visitors Allowed," it was not easily accessible to visitors. I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Shao Zuiweng, the owner of the company, so I was fortunate not to be rejected.</p>
<p>The stars were dressed in gorgeous attire and adorned with accessories, and each of the actresses took turns singing into the microphone according to the scheduled program. The small broadcast studio was filled with the sound of musical instrument and songs. The songs they sang were certainly pleasant to listen to, but they were mostly lyrical and scenic, lacking profound meaning. Finally, Ms. Chen Yumei sang "Support the Volunteer Army," with four verses. Both the music and lyrics were written by Mr. Gao Tianqi. The tone was tragic and desolate, and the words were passionate and stirring. I will record the lyrics below:</p>
<p>"(1) The White Mountains lose their color, the Black Water is silent, the enemy runs rampant and unrestrained, blood flows across the fields, people are killed in the cities, airplanes drop bombs in a shocking display, not yet, a stateless person, there's no place to escape to, to whom do we turn for justice in this world? Alas, the Northeast, full of enemy soldiers, my compatriots, their lives are insignificant, deep pain and great wounds, hatred is hard to quell! (2) Flying sand covers the face, the north wind roars, the courage of the volunteer army pierces the clouds, fighting bravely against the enemy, leaping on horseback and brandishing swords, blood splatters on the battle robes. Eating the wind, sleeping in the dew, ammunition is running out, the heart is even more anxious, the icy and snowy land is cold and hard to bear! Resist the powerful enemy, save our compatriots, protect our homeland, and perform meritorious service, the Republic of China, great heroes! (3) Fragrant clothes, youthful figures, green wine, bright lights, dance halls and singing venues are endlessly joyous, fashionable men and women, noble and dignified, cars like flowing water, horses like dragons. Your eyes are not blind, your ears are not deaf, why are your hearts so oblivious? Think of the mourning in the Northeast, the volunteer army, struggling to survive the winter, I ask you, are you moved in your hearts? (4) The heart of the people is not dead, China is not forgotten, eliminate extravagance and avoid absurdity. Opening a banquet, celebrating birthdays, it is better to move the funds to support the front lines, military, political, academic, agricultural, commercial, rise up together, save the country from danger, everyone enthusiastically gives up their money bags, help the volunteer army, consolidate national defense, recover lost territories, drive away tigers and wolves, the Chinese nation has glory!"</p>
<p>After the broadcast was over, Mr. Shao led me to the photography studio to visit. The studio was filming "Pursuit," starring Li Minghui and Hu Shan. I asked Mr. Shao if there were any new films being released recently. Mr. Shao said, "The recently filmed "Double Sin in the Sea of Iniquity" is a work attacking the inheritance system and will be released soon." I said, "I hope your company will produce more films that inspire patriotic thoughts, because this type of film is what China needs most right now!"</p>
<h3>Where is Our Spoken Drama?</h3>
<p>— Tai Sheng</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang went to the United States and shook hands with Douglas Fairbanks, and Cheng Yanqiu also crossed the ocean to meet the French. This is the glory of China's inherent national opera!</p>
<p>But where has our "spoken drama" gone? The thriving "Southern Country" was performed a few times, then disappeared without a trace. The drama troupes of various university students also vanished like smoke. Where is our spoken drama?</p>
<p>In Europe, the magnificence of the theaters and the enthusiasm of the general public for spoken drama make us feel an infinite sense of disappointment! Do we lack talent for spoken drama? I don't believe it. Are there no successful talents in the performances of various drama troupes? Have you not heard Ms. Tang Shuming's lament? Have you not seen Mr. Yuan Muzhi's expressions and tones? Is it failure or success?</p>
<p>Arise! This is no longer the time to write only war literature or love literature. What we want is to use our national consciousness to whisper to the masses the significance of "September 18th" and the situation behind "January 28th," so that our people can have a common understanding!</p>

<p>Spot Prices Fall, Exchange Rates Tighten</p>
<p>The Gold Market Stages Another Surge Fueled by Small Amounts</p>
<p>(Low Volume and High Sentiment) Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, London large amounts decreased one or two five in both near and far terms. New York quotations were unchanged. British-American exchange rates soared by three points six two five. American-British exchange rates also rose by three and a half points. Although forward silver prices decreased by six haos to two li, American cotton was high at six or seven pounds. The gold market still opened at a low level, likely due to the unexpected surge in exchange rates. The morning opening was at seven hundred eighty-nine taels and three qians, initially falling to eight taels and three qians. The exchange market opened with tight British exchange and loose American exchange, but not by much. Market sentiment was stable, and major players continued to aggressively acquire, leading to a rebound. US dollars for April at 28.625 yuan were difficult to close, but broke through ninety taels. Furthermore, because HSBC's posted exchange rate for shillings decreased by two five and US dollars by one two five, the exchange rate reached ninety-two taels, making the exchange market even tighter. Buyers in the market were excited, and prices gradually rose. Shillings for the current month at seven five and US dollars at one eight seven five were difficult to close, reaching seven hundred ninety-six taels. The noon closing was at ninety-five taels and six qians. The afternoon opening was immediately positive. The Dalian gang was acquiring, and the opening was seven hundred ninety-six taels. It then fell from six taels and a half to five taels and a half. After that, everything went smoothly. Gold prices gradually increased, likely due to the extremely tight exchange market. Shillings for the current month required six two five to close, and US dollars required one two five. A dispatch from Bombay reported a decrease of seven, nine, and Anna, jumping to seven hundred ninety-seven taels and eight qians. Afterwards, the exchange market gradually became peaceful. Banks slightly released after acquiring, fluctuating downwards without causing much disturbance. Trading became light, eventually reaching five taels and seven qians, which was extremely stable. The final closing was at seven hundred ninety-six taels and two qians. Although the opening during the day fell due to overseas silver market conditions, prices gradually rose afterwards, even higher than the previous closing. Market sentiment was extremely good, and market atmosphere was strong, primarily due to the extreme shortage of spot goods and low volume. The general sentiment in the gold industry was positive early on, but the timing was not yet ripe, and fluctuations were unavoidable. Near the switch date, prices seemed likely to rise. Recently, many sellers had appeared, and after this morning's decline and rebound, major players were acquiring, leading to a surge in acquisition. In addition, HSBC's posted exchange rates, which had been stable for many days, suddenly decreased yesterday, causing the switch date to open high. Spot goods dealers Ying Feng Heng were desperately posting offers, but counterparts were still lacking, further confirming the lack of spot goods. Market sentiment was even better, which also tightened the exchange market and created yesterday's surge. The market conditions are divided and recorded as follows.</p>
<p>(Gradual Advance After Low Opening) The morning opening was seven hundred eighty-nine taels and three qians, three taels lower than the previous closing. Shen Yu, Yi Feng, and Yong Lai were selling, reaching eight taels and three qians. The shilling market was extremely strong. The current month at eight one two five was still difficult to close. Gold prices gradually rebounded. US dollars for April at six two five could not be closed. Da De Cheng advanced to around ninety taels. Heng Yu also acquired at ninety taels and zero seventy-eight qians. Run Chang Yu and Da De Cheng briefly sold off, falling a few qians. After that, the surge gradually intensified. Yuan Mao, Yong Nei, and Xing Lai acquired. Fu Yu also acquired, reaching ninety-one taels. At this time, it was anticipated that the posted exchange rate would decrease. Zhi Feng and Yong Wu Pin then acquired, reaching one tael and nine qians. Heng Xing slightly sold off, stabilizing at one tael and a half. After that, the market became stagnant. Although Wan Xing and others sold off, Bing Xing continued to acquire, causing fluctuations. When Heng Yu sold, Bing Xing was already at capacity and retreated to zero eight qians. HSBC's posted exchange rates clearly decreased, with shillings down two five and US dollars down one two five. Da De Cheng and Rui Xing both acquired, pulling up to ten around ninety-one taels. Shillings for March at eight seven five could not be closed, reaching two taels. Zheng Jin acquired US dollars for February at three one two five. Da De Cheng and others advanced to two taels and a half. Zhao Feng Chang also acquired at three taels and one qian. Wu Pin smoothly sold off, falling to two taels and a half. Yu Yu also sold at around two taels. Wu Pin then sold off again, falling to within two taels. However, major players were acquiring aggressively, and market sentiment was good, preventing further declines. Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, and Yi Feng Yong advanced to beyond three taels. The US exchange rate for February Hua Bi sought to close at three one two five. Heng Yu and Hong Li acquired, reaching four taels and three qians. Yuan Heng sold, falling to within four taels. Zhi Feng Yong and Zhao Feng Chang acquired, reaching five taels. Bing Xing came forward, retreating one tael to four taels. Shillings for the current month at seven five and US dollars at one eight seven five were difficult to close, continuing upwards. Yuan Kang Xiang and Heng Yu slightly acquired, reaching five taels and seven qians. However, Heng Xing limited its position and sold, causing a decline. Fu Shun also sold at five taels and three qians. Hong Li, Yu Fa, and Yong acquired, stabilizing at five taels and a half. Yong Feng and Rui Xing also acquired, likely because their counterparts wanted to close US dollars for March at three one two five but were unable to. Prices remained at five taels and seven qians. Wu Pin sold, reaching five taels. Yuan Heng sold even further, falling to four taels and four qians, fluctuating slightly. Later, a surge suddenly occurred. Rui Xing acquired, selling at five taels. Market sentiment was extremely good, surging to ninety-six taels. The noon closing was at five taels and six qians. Wu Pin's auction price was slightly lower at seven hundred ninety-five taels.</p>
<p>(Gradual Decline After Positive Close) The afternoon opening immediately jumped to seven hundred ninety-six taels. Shun Li and others acquired, reaching six taels and five qians. Bing Xing came forward to sell, and Fu Chang also sold, falling to five taels and five qians. Zheng Jin acquired shillings for the current month at six eight seven five. Yuan Heng suddenly advanced to over ten thousand taels. Heng Yu also acquired. The exchange market tightened again. US dollars for the current month required one two five to seven taels to close. Da De Cheng, Hong Li, and Fu Yu all acquired, reaching seven taels and six qians. Hua Bi sold US dollars for April at three one two five, falling to seven taels. A dispatch from Bombay reported a small change. Hua Bi bought US dollars for February at one eight seven five. Zhao Feng Chang, Yuan Chun, and Hui Xiang all acquired aggressively, rising to ninety-seven taels and eight qians. A dealer from the Dongyang firm released shillings for April at seven five. Fu Chang and Yuan Mao Yong all sold, retreating to within seven taels. After that, the exchange market turned calm, and the gold market was also calm with few transactions. The market was relatively calm. Heng Xing opened on behalf of the Central Bank, supporting prices above seven taels for a very long time, fluctuating greatly. Retail investors and Ding Chang slightly sold, falling to within seven taels. The Netherlands released US dollars for March at two five. Fu Yu sold to six taels and two four qians. After a moment, Fu Yu sold again to five taels and seven qians. After that, prices hovered around six taels for a long time. Heng Xing and Fu Yu were in selling positions, and market sentiment was still good, with general retail investors buying. Therefore, there were struggles around six taels. As the closing approached, various firms showed signs of fatigue, and there were even fewer transactions. The market only saw Wu Pin and retail investors competing for ups and downs. Yuan Mao Yong occasionally bought and sold, which was enough to deal with the market. The final closing was at seven hundred ninety-six taels and three qians. After the closing, Wu Pin came forward to acquire at six taels and a half. Yuan Heng sold, retreating to the original price. However, Wu Pin continued to auction at six taels and six qians, so the gold industry continued to rise to six taels and eight qians. Heng Xing sold and stopped. The highest price of the day was seven hundred ninety-seven taels and eight qians, and the lowest price was seven hundred eighty-eight taels and three qians, with fluctuations of nine taels and five qians. As a result, the closing price was four taels higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>(Futures Prices Open High, Spot Goods Scarce) The Central Bank's opening was slightly reduced, likely because futures prices rose and were difficult to handle, and volume was low. It was only heard that Heng Xing opened one hundred forty positions on behalf of the bank in the afternoon, with prices ranging from seven taels to seven taels and two qians.</p>
<p>(Discounted Price Reduced Slightly) The discounted price was calculated because HSBC's posted exchange rate for US dollars was slightly lower, at eighteen yuan, which corresponds to a gold price of eight hundred fifty-seven taels, one qian, four fen. The closing price was about sixty taels lower, and the discount was less than two qians lower than the previous close. The registered price for this month was seven hundred ninety-seven taels, and the registered price for March was seven hundred ninety-six taels. The morning supplement was seven hundred ninety taels, and the afternoon was the same.</p>
<p>(Demand Still Exceeds Supply) On the trading floor, transactions were still surging, with demand still exceeding supply. Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Rui Xing, Yong Feng, Da De Cheng, Hong Li, Yuan Kang Xiang, and Heng Yu all acquired. Fu Chang, Nei Xing, Yi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong Heng, Run Chang Yu, Yuan Chun, and Heng Xing sold. Yuan Xin Yong came to acquire at the afternoon closing. The Dalian gang made few deals. The general manager slightly acquired. Guang Bang Heng Xing's acquisitions were roughly balanced. Shen Da's transactions were only a few. As of the day before yesterday, the total volume for March was sixteen thousand two hundred and five positions.</p>
<p>(Switch Date Slightly Increases, Transactions Sparse) The switch date increased slightly yesterday, but there were few transactions. Jia 11 taels was used. Only Ying Feng Heng and Tong Feng Heng slightly traded with each other in the market. Transactions were less than one hundred taels. However, this price was actually extremely difficult to obtain. Afterwards, the price was around 11 taels.</p>
<p>(Switch Premium Reaches Two Taels) The switch market suddenly increased yesterday, likely because spot goods were low due to continued low futures prices, and foreign routes were lacking. The premium was high. Initially, it was hesitant at one tael, and Ying Feng Heng aggressively posted offers. It first switched thirty-five positions with Da De Cheng, with a premium of one tael and eight qians. Ying Feng Heng continued to post thirty-five positions to Qian Chang Xiang and thirty-five positions to Da De Cheng, with a premium of two taels. Afterwards, many parties disappeared. Although Ying Feng Heng wanted to post offers, it suffered from a lack of counterparts. Occasionally, Ying Feng Heng had bought in at a low price, but now it needed to release spot goods to the Central Bank. With lacking foreign routes and small positions, it had no choice but to sell at a high price. As of the day before yesterday, there were still two thousand and seventy-nine positions remaining for February.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Suddenly Becomes Tight</h3>
<p>｜Posted Exchange Rates Also Decrease Slightly... Domestic Trading Still Strong｜</p>

New York silver prices were unchanged, and forward prices decreased from six haos to two li. However, stock prices increased, and American cotton was also high.

Furthermore, HSBC's posted exchange rates suddenly decreased slightly, with shillings down two five and US dollars down one two five. Both the exchange market and the gold market were tight.

The banks' buying and selling prices for the day are recorded as follows.</p>

The British-American exchange rate opened at three yuan, four jiao, two fen, eight seventy-five.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rises Suddenly, Market Atmosphere Remains Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate rose sharply due to slight buying interest from banks. The closing price was 7.1275 yuan, an increase of 0.875 yuan compared to the previous day. Silver was still borrowed for transactions, with no added water in the calculation.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market in a Stagnant State</h3>
<p>Initial Uptrend Followed by Immediate Decline</p>
<p>Extremely Sluggish Trading in the Later Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw government bonds gradually enter a sluggish phase. Initially, due to diplomatic news that Britain had made a clear statement of non-recognition of Manchukuo, hopes for reconciliation were slim, but the Northeast situation might avoid expansion. The market atmosphere was quite good in the early morning session. At the opening, buying by various groups dominated, and market prices rose by several jiao to one yuan. However, due to the lack of activity from major players, the overall upward momentum weakened, causing a slight dip in the second session, though salt tax bonds still rose by two or three jiao. The market situation remained cyclical. Afternoon trading sharply declined, with only one to two million yuan in transactions across both sessions. The activity of various groups was extremely sluggish, and there were no significant inflows or outflows from retail investors. Major players remained on the sidelines, causing market prices to become increasingly stagnant. The closing results showed an increase of 0.05 yuan for 1918 customs bonds, 0.05 yuan for forward salt tax bonds, and 0.1 yuan for 1996 bonds. The remaining bonds all rose by several jiao, with the 1919 customs bonds showing the largest increase of 0.7 to 0.8 yuan. The total trading volume was 5,887,000 yuan, including 12,000 yuan in spot transactions. Forward salt tax bonds accounted for 2.5 million yuan, with the remaining bonds only accounting for tens to five or six hundred thousand yuan. The trend is likely to continue in a cyclical pattern.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Weak, Then Strong</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Sun Fong Trading Company, the New York stock market trended weaker on Monday (6th). Industrial and utility stocks fell to new lows for the year. Later, Chicago wheat prices rose by more than one cent due to a report favoring long positions, prompting short sellers and the public to buy in. The stock market sentiment improved, and most stocks rebounded. The total trading volume for the day was 670,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 58.07 Up 0.51</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 27.90 Up 0.06</p>
<p>Twenty Utility Stocks 24.76 Unchanged</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 79.80 Down 0.18</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Prices Still Steady in the Morning, Firm in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, with the trend remaining cyclical. The international situation continued to trend downward, but slightly higher gold prices caused some anxiety. Customer sales were higher than the previous day, leading to a slight increase in market prices. However, large-scale transactions were still lacking. Warehouse inventories of 20-count yarn were over 23,000 bales, creating significant pressure.</p>
<p>(Retail Investors Covering Shorts in the Afternoon Market) The opening of the cotton yarn market was influenced by a slight rise in U.S. cotton prices, but market sentiment was flat, with prices for all months falling by one qian. In the afternoon, news of rising gold prices and higher raw cotton prices prompted retail investors to cover their shorts, and prices for all months rose by 1, 2, 3, or 4 qian. In addition, a certain country's yarn price fell by two yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 10,500 bales, with Sui Lung selling 2,000 bales, Ming De selling 600 bales, Tung Hing selling 300 bales, and Yih Chang selling 350 bales. Tung Foo bought 1,600 bales, Hsieh Sheng bought 400 bales, and Yung Ta bought 550 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Prices and Changes for Cotton Yarn Futures Contracts Outstanding Accounts</p>
<p>May 14.65 Up 3 27,750</p>
<p>February 14.29 ··· 3 66,00</p>

<p>July 14.73 Up 3 5,250</p>
<p>April 14.53 41,250</p>
<p>Total 176,110</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales More Active) Spot yarn demand was relatively strong. The total daily purchases by various firms were estimated at 1,010 bales. Prices were the same as the previous day, except for a decrease of 0.05 yuan for 32-count yarn. The purchases by various firms are listed below:</p>
<p>Yunnan 40, Tianjin 5, Sichuan 30, Shantou 30, Northern Traders 15, Peers 15, Inland 213, Wuhu 5, Guangdong 237, Ningbo 10, Nanyang 10</p>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon due to higher gold prices and increased activity from long positions, primarily driven by psychological factors. U.S. cotton prices were affected by exchange rates, with silver-based purchases rising by several qian. Buyers increased their purchases, but there was no interest in high prices from factories. The overseas cotton market remained weak. Indian Broach cotton prices fell by two rupees, to 185 rupees.</p>
<p>(Long Positions Active in the Afternoon Zheng Standard Market) The Zheng Standard market opened with flat U.S. cotton prices and limited buying interest, with prices for all months remaining flat. In the afternoon, news of rising gold prices caused excitement and increased long positions, pushing prices upward by 0.01 to 0.015 yuan for all months. The total trading volume for the day was 27,200 dan. Chung Kee sold 1,000 dan, Yuan Da sold 1,900 dan, Shen Kee sold 1,000 dan, and Hsin Cheng sold 1,000 dan. Yih Feng bought 2,700 dan, Chang Feng bought 1,900 dan, Chi Feng bought 900 dan, and Chang Ho bought 1,000 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Prices and Changes Outstanding Accounts</p>
<p>May 33.10 Up 0.15 70,100</p>
<p>February 32.20 Up 0.15 93,200</p>

<p>April 32.90 Up 0.20 97,700</p>
<p>Total 42,600</p>
<p>(Cotton Demand Flat and Weak) Spot cotton business was relatively flat.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Rebounds on Trade Buying</h3>
<p>U.S. cotton futures initially weakened due to public selling, but rebounded due to trade buying and short covering. Futures prices rose by 4 to 8 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 10 to 11 points, and spot prices fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 14 points. Indian cotton markets were closed.

<h3>Rice: Foreign Rice and Native Rice Show Different Trends</h3>
<p>Thin Rice Slightly Available; Saigon Rice Sold Yesterday</p>
<p>Customer Yuan and Yin Yuan Drop by Four to Five Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were thirty to forty shipments. City and rural stores had some buying interest, but only four to five hundred shi were purchased. The market prices for rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Nan Gang were not significantly different. Only thin rice and Du Foreign Point were scarce and highly sought after, with prices rising by more than one jiao. Yin Yuan was weak and abundant, with a soft trend. Initial shipments from Chang Merchants were not large. High-quality rice opened at 9.1 yuan, medium-quality rice opened at 8.5 yuan, and factory rice only opened for Customer Yuan and Yin Yuan. The market situation showed no significant changes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over forty ships arrived from various groups in the river region. White rice prices were flat, while rice from the countryside was weak, with a slight decrease in market prices. Shipments of thin rice and early rice continued to arrive. Furthermore, there was some movement in Tianjin bagged rice, and prices were stable. Du Point arrivals were low, and prices were stable. Foreign Point arrivals continued, with weak retail demand and a soft trend of more than one chi. Customer Point prices were stable, and Yin Yuan prices were steady. While White Yuan arrivals were not strong, retail sales were slow, causing prices to fall by four to five jiao.</p>
<p>(Customer Xian Yuan) Yesterday, Customer Xian Yuan continued to arrive. Customer Xian sales were very active. There were many Customer Yuan in stock and arriving, along with arrivals from the river region. However, the only outlet was Fujian Province. The local market focused on Du Yuan from the river region, and sellers were keen to sell upon arrival, unwilling to hoard. Therefore, the previous day's selling price of 10.3 yuan for Wuhu machine-milled rice was only offered at 9.9 yuan, with slightly lower quality rice at 9.8 yuan. Medium-quality rice needed to be negotiated separately. It was estimated that Fujian merchants bought 300 bags, and also bought 96 bags of Hunan red unpolished rice at a price of 7.4 yuan. Customer Xian was active in the local market, and the market remained stable. It was estimated that 2,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were purchased at prices ranging from 9.1 yuan to 8.7 yuan, and 500 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice were purchased at a price of 8.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) There had been no transactions for a long time. Recently, foreign merchants have been actively promoting new goods, and the contract price for delivery in April and May is low, making it potentially worthwhile to purchase. As a result, foreign merchants with inventory are changing their strategy, and those who previously insisted on holding firm are now showing signs of activity. Yesterday, Anli Foreign Firm sold 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at a price of 8.85 yuan. The rice quality was still good, but it had been in Shanghai for a long time and was slightly stale.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Markets Difficult to Revive, Weak and Flat</h3>
<p>(Flour: Near Month Lower, Far Month Higher) Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for all months showed an initial stabilization followed by a weak trend. This was because foreign wheat quotations improved by about 0.1124 yuan. As a result, the opening price for the current month was 0.015 yuan higher than the previous day, and the far month also showed a slight improvement. However, the near month weakened again after the midday session, due to limited buying interest from customer merchants. Furthermore, many long positions were being unwound, causing the market to weaken again. The far month trended flat because factories were not selling in large quantities. At the afternoon opening, the current month remained weak, with the lowest price dropping to 1.28 yuan. If customer merchants remained on the sidelines, it was feared that the 1.28 yuan level would be breached. The far month market stabilized due to slight activity from customer merchants. Under these circumstances, the inverted market will likely be resolved. As a result, the current month was 0.0025 yuan lower than the previous day, while the February and April months were 0.025 yuan higher, the May month was 0.075 yuan higher, the June month was 0.125 yuan higher, and the July month was 0.1 yuan higher.</p>
<p>(Wheat: Difficult to Buy and Sell) Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, prices for all months remained flat, and trading volume remained low in all sessions, with mainly empty bids. Trading became more active in the afternoon session, but the market ultimately lacked sufficient chips, making it difficult to develop positions. The feeling remained that it was difficult to sell and difficult to buy. This situation will likely improve when foreign wheat arrivals increase. As a result, the current month was unchanged, the March and April months each decreased by 0.01 yuan, and there were no other price changes.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Increased Quotations for Flat Branches</h3>
<p>｜ Glutinous Rice Branches with Good Quality are Scarce｜</p>
<p>Due to low inventories, quotations for Jinshan Flat Branches gradually increased. The current market price for top-grade goods is 28 taels, medium-grade is 26.6 taels, and low-grade is 22-24 taels. Glutinous Rice Branches are also scarce. Yesterday, the highest market price was 76 taels, with slightly lower prices for other grades. Top-grade goods were selling for 80 taels. Recent market prices for wood ear fungus were around 58 taels for Zhuangchuan ear fungus and 55-56 taels for Yichang ear fungus, with a stable market trend. At the same time, full-package Gao Shi ear fungus was selling for 56 taels, and ordinary ear fungus was selling for 55 taels. However, market demand was not strong, and there was no expectation of excessive price increases.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Life and Living</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Ah Rong and his mother finished planting the barley, feeling much lighter, as if a heavy burden had been lifted from their shoulders. Moreover, everyone felt joy in their hearts. The mother was happy because she could welcome a daughter-in-law in a few days and enjoy some of her old age. The son, on the other hand, had his own thoughts: he would have a wife he had longed for, from whom he could receive certain unspeakable things...</p>
<p>"Ah Rong, only a dozen days left." The mother often counted the days, and Ah Rong felt even happier from the bottom of his heart upon hearing his mother's words.</p>
<p>Because to welcome this bride, they only needed to bring her home and have her bow to heaven and earth, and that would be the end of it. They wouldn't need to buy anything or host a feast, all for the sake of saving money.</p>
<p>Ah Rong's family consisted only of his mother, who was over fifty years old, and himself. In every respect, it was long overdue for him to bring a wife home! She could manage the household affairs and also find time to do some work in the fields. But why had it been delayed until now? The reason was quite simple: he had no money.</p>
<p>In any case, that day was finally approaching, and it was the best day of all. Both he and his mother were eagerly awaiting that day...</p>
<p>It had been more than ten days since Ah Rong had brought his wife home. In these short ten days, not only Ah Rong himself, but also Ah Rong's mother and even the wife, all seemed to be living a new life. There was affection, gentleness, comfort, and vitality, definitely not the cold and silent atmosphere of the past.</p>
<p>The son was satisfied with his wife, the mother was satisfied with her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law also looked up to this not-so-wealthy family!</p>
<p>This was better than anything else.</p>
<p>"Mom, dinner's ready."</p>
<p>The first time the mother heard her daughter-in-law calling for dinner, she was inspecting the barley sprouts by the field. At that moment, she was so happy that she didn't know what to do, because the daughter-in-law had taken the household chores upon herself. She walked along, smiling as she said:</p>
<p>"Mom's coming."</p>
<p>Mom knew that Ah Rong, who was working, wanted her to call him, but the daughter-in-law hadn't been there for many days and couldn't bring herself to call a man. Mom saw more sunshine than her son and daughter-in-law and knew more about things, so she called out:</p>
<p>"Ah Rong, dinner's ready."</p>
<p>Seeing Ah Rong carry his hoe on his shoulder and walk back cheerfully, the mother felt extremely happy. She stared blankly at the son who had been born from her own body.</p>
<p>The setting sun then sent the mother and son into the house, before turning its brilliance to another world. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>"Responsibility" and "Forbidden Responsibility"</h3>
<p>— Li Bing</p>
<p>Since the so-called "national crisis" occurred, in addition to solemnly sending people to the League of Nations in Geneva for diplomatic negotiations, the government also sincerely said to the common people: "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation; the government is prepared for a long-term resistance, and we hope that the common people will be the government's backing."</p>
<p>The common people were very honest and seemed to have completely misunderstood the government's good intentions. Thus, they organized anti-Japanese associations, formed volunteer armies, petitioned and demonstrated, and even began to question the government. The important figures of the government, seeing that they were not understood, frowned. As a result, the anti-Japanese association in a certain place was shut down due to "unavoidable difficulties," the volunteer army in a certain place was disbanded due to "certain suspicions," and many students who petitioned and demonstrated "accidentally fell into the water." All became sacrifices for "taking responsibility," and the situation seemed somewhat similar to "forbidden responsibility."</p>
<p>However, those in power still made "declarations" and "demands" as if nothing had happened, "Please everyone take on the responsibility of saving the country, be the government's backing, and the government will definitely resist to the end."</p>
<p>Confused people cannot help but doubt the "inconsistency between words and actions" of those in power. Why do they ask people to take responsibility on the one hand, and seem to forbid people from taking responsibility on the other? But they do not know that "responsibility" is not just one kind: some "responsibilities" are to be asked of everyone, while some "responsibilities" are not allowed to be taken by everyone. For example, fundraising to support military spending is the "backing" that those in power need most. This kind of "responsibility" is to be taken by everyone.</p>
<p>There are many ways to fundraise, the best of which is entertainment fundraising, tea dance fundraising... embedding ardent patriotism within elegance and beauty. On the one hand, the government gains practical benefits, and on the other hand, a group of frivolous youngsters can be anesthetized by eroticism, and they will no longer have the energy to organize anti-Japanese associations, form volunteer armies, and take on the responsibility of meddling in others' affairs.</p>
<p>Apart from fundraising to support military spending, those in power have their own ways of handling everything else, without the need for the common people to worry. Stupid common people, please recognize your responsibilities!</p>
<h3>Brothers in Prison</h3>
<p>— Ji Liang</p>
<p>I have a brother who is the same age as me. Although we were born in the same year, he is stronger than I am. He has a heart full of ever-boiling enthusiasm and a backbone of resolute resistance.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, he participated in an anti-something gathering against foreign countries, and he and his group were taken away by a group of compatriots who did not allow "anti." I began to inquire about his whereabouts from all sides, but I could not get any results for a long time. So I began to worry: would he have any unexpected misfortunes? Especially his ever-boiling enthusiasm and resolute resistance, which are stronger than mine, I wonder if they are still safe?</p>
<p>About two months later, I suddenly received a letter from him from the W City prison. Needless to say, I was pleased, but at the same time, I was also worried: wouldn't there be sad tears in the letter! Tears of pain and regret mixed together? When I opened it, I realized that I had guessed wrong. He only wrote about the living conditions in prison. The important thing was the following paragraphs:</p>
<p>'The room is as big as the front building, with six bunks, accommodating nine of us companions. We are used to it, so it is not too crowded.</p>
<p>'We eat four meals a day: dry rice at 9 a.m., porridge at 9:30 a.m.; dry rice again at 4 p.m., porridge again at 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>'When we first arrived here, the vegetables for each meal every day were just monotonous yellow-orange greens; now we can actually eat radishes twice a week, greens with tofu twice, and a piece of pork. In this way, I can often see the appearance of meat and tofu here!</p>
<p>'After each meal, each person is usually given a cup of boiled water, and we combine these nine cups of water to provide for two people to wash with. In this way, we can pay attention to cleanliness once every five days!'</p>
<p>He was humorously savoring his prison life, obviously taking it calmly. From the beginning to the end of the letter, there was not a trace of sadness, pain, or regret, and naturally not a single tear.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, I sent my wife to visit him. She reported back that he still had his original smile when they met, and his face actually looked a little fatter. So I was also at ease.</p>
<p>Recently, I received the six-year prison sentence that he sent by registered mail, along with these few words: 'After reading this, you will know how ridiculous my lawsuit was, and how playful the image of destiny appearing in front of me is!' He didn't say injustice but 'ridiculous,' didn't say ferocity but 'playful,' which made me, a weakling, feel a kind of incomprehensible mystery!</p>
<p>The lunar New Year was coming, and I got the opportunity to visit him in person. But it was ridiculous that when I stood at the window of the meeting, which was less than a foot in diameter, I had already lost the power of composure and kept trembling! Following a startling sound of iron chains, the face of my brother, whom I had been separated from for half a year, finally appeared at another window hole a few feet away. So I tried hard to make a trembling sound and asked about everything—everything, in fact, was just three or five chaotic and intermittent questions. But he, still with his original smile, and indeed calm and composed, said what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>After leaving the prison, I was ashamed of my cowardice, regretting the meaninglessness and incompleteness of the questions I asked. Fortunately, the last few words of my brother—a report—had given me the greatest comfort and a lot of courage. What he said was:</p>
<p>'Recently, because I still did not behave, I was punished by being slapped on the palm of my hand once and had another pair of shackles added.'</p>
<p>I understood what kind of act this "not behaving" was and what kind of meaning it contained, so I was sure that he was "all" well!</p>
<p>Can the coldness of the prison freeze his ever-boiling enthusiasm? Can the heavy pressure of shackles soften his backbone of resolute resistance?</p>
<p>No! It won't! Because I have gotten a basis to believe deeply.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Results of the First Essay Contest in This Publication</h3>
<p>In early December of last year, in order to test the general readers' understanding of contemporary world celebrities, this publication specially held the first prize-winning essay contest. The topic of the essay was: "The Ten Greatest People in the Contemporary World." The rules of participation were: "Select ten famous figures (excluding the deceased) from contemporary world politicians, scientists, philosophers, writers, etc., with a brief explanation of about one hundred words for each person, but the entire manuscript should not exceed one thousand words to be qualified." At the same time, it was stipulated that the selected articles would be published in this publication successively starting from January 10 of this year. As of December 31 of last year, we had received a total of 534 entries. However, due to various factual obstacles, the results of the essay contest were delayed for a long time and could not be announced. Here, we solemnly apologize to all the participants.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of 534 entries, the ten world's greatest people selected are: 1) Gandhi (492 votes) 2) Mussolini (456 votes) 3) Einstein (447 votes) 4) Stalin (419 votes) 5) Gorky (387 votes) 6) Kemal (365 votes) 7) Madame Curie (314 votes) 8) Shaw (258 votes) 9) Trotsky (244 votes) 10) Russell (178 votes). The above ten people are the result of our test this time.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the above results, we also obtained an unexpected gain. This unexpected gain is that we counted the Chinese people listed in the entries and obtained ten Chinese great people who received more votes. These ten Chinese great people are: 1) Cai Tingkai (48 votes) 2) Ma Zhanshan (43 votes) 3) Su Bingwen (39 votes) 4) Zhu Qinglan (31 votes) 5) Zhu Jiqing (27 votes) 6) Ma Xiangbo (22 votes) 7) Cai Yuanpei (19 votes) 8) Shi Liangcai (15 votes) 9) Chiang Kai-shek (11 votes) 10) Wang Jingwei (8 votes).</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot regard this result as correct, because there were only 534 participants. But from this result, we should at least be able to know a glimpse of the "hearts of the people."</p>
<p>The five selected for this essay contest are: 1) Mr. Xue Dahua 2) Mr. Zheng Xian 3) Mr. Yu Zhuo'an 4) Mr. Cheng Benjin 5) Mr. Li Youlong. Mr. Xue's manuscript will be published in this column in the coming days. Readers, please pay attention.</p>
<p>To Mr. Wei Ji, Xu, Miao, Xia Qiu, Huiyi, Li Yun, Su, Mingyi, Xu Shangzhou, Qiu Peng, Lao Su, Shuji, and Shi Jingxie: Please inform us of your current address so that we can send you the manuscript fee statements for last month.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Times and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"As soon as she sees that Japanese guy, she neglects me! It's outrageous!······ After all, she's not one of us!·······" He went upstairs, feeling annoyed. From annoyance, he became sad, and his cheap tears almost welled up again. "She's not even a great beauty, and she's a bit old too. Why am I still infatuated with her!·······"</p>
<p>When he couldn't figure it out, he comforted himself in this way.</p>
<p>He was really tired after walking all day. His skin felt rough from the wind. But when he returned to his room, it was not only as cold as the underworld, but no one brought him boiled water either—not only did Mrs. Tsuruko not come, but even the nanny had become arrogant lately and did not take good care of his affairs. He couldn't stand it anymore and hurried to the stairwell on the second floor, yelling for the nanny.</p>
<p>"Nanny, quickly go to the hot water stove to get hot water for the gentleman to wash his face, and quickly make tea and bring it up!"</p>
<p>He heard Mrs. Tsuruko instruct the nanny in this way, and his anger subsided a little.</p>
<p>He was afraid of the cold, so after washing his face, he took off his outer clothes, put on only his underwear, and crawled into bed. He intuitively felt that Mrs. Tsuruko would definitely come up to see him in a while and comfort him, so he stayed awake and waited for her. At first, he picked up a newspaper to read, but he couldn't concentrate. He was just guessing about the relationship between Mrs. Tsuruko and that Japanese guy, and what they were doing downstairs.</p>
<p>"They are reunited after a long separation!······ Like a welcome rain after a long drought!······ True love doesn't care about age differences!·······"</p>
<p>Thinking this, he felt a nameless jealousy in his heart. He listened carefully to the movement downstairs, then looked at the watch he had taken off and placed beside his pillow. It was almost twelve o'clock. The guests downstairs seemed to have left, and there was a silence with not a sound.</p>
<p>"If the guests are gone, she should come up to see me,······ she will definitely tiptoe, push the door open,······ I quickly pull the covers over my head,······ she walks to my bedside and lifts the corner of my blanket,······ I pretend to be asleep······ she uses her fingertips to wipe the corner of my mouth,······ ah, ah,······ I still open my eyes slightly,······ take the opportunity to reach out and grab her neck,······ she falls on top of me unexpectedly,······ kiss, kiss, kiss endlessly!······ That's how it is! That's how it is!·······"</p>
<p>His body was as cold as ice cream an hour ago, but at this moment, it was like a freshly steamed meat bun. No, his bed was simply a volcano. He became excited and couldn't sleep anymore, just tossing and turning.</p>

<p>Grabbing my pen, I immediately wanted to, but was not very willing to, act like an old fogey, huffing and puffing with sleeves folded and legs shaking, "Lamenting the decline of the world and hating the degeneration of people's hearts." "Chastity" and "Martyrdom" in this day and age have probably been wiped clean off the table!"</p>
<p>I once boasted to my friends that I had read many songbooks about three kinds of chastity and nine kinds of loyalty, like "Meng Jiangnu's Journey of Ten Thousand Miles to Find Her Husband," and had seen many novels and stories about loyal and virtuous officials who "bitterly remonstrated without being heeded, cried bitterly, and finally smashed their heads on the golden steps," as well as "Wen Tianxiang, who wrote the Righteous Qi Song" and "Shi Kefa, who was killed when the city fell." As for Yue Wu Mu and Guan Zhuang Miao, as well as the Xue family father and son who conquered the east and west, and the brave act of attending a meeting alone with a single knife, of course, these were the idols whose images were deepest in my mind, and I could even depict their spirits with my eyes closed. Therefore, my friends ridiculed and scolded me as a backward thinker who went against the times. Their reasons and grounds were that for thousands of years, the two words "chastity" had directly killed countless young women, and indirectly destroyed human groups. In such a revolutionary high tide, such inhuman, cruel, and ruthless acts were naturally the targets of our revolution. The disappearance of "chastity" today is precisely a sign of the success of the revolution! As for the term "loyalty and martyrdom," it is even more worthless. It is the supreme creed of selfish personal heroism. Although "martyrs" are able and dare to risk their lives for the country's final struggle, this is too narrow, too superficial, and too unhelpful. We are revolutionary new youths, and we must fundamentally break this narrow term of giving our lives away in vain. Instead, we should be calm and tolerant before the event, and use clear and lucid minds to decide on long-term resistance. This is a broad, thorough, and practical revolution...</p>
<p>Before I had finished listening to this long, great revolutionary theory, I seemed to have been greatly enlightened, and yet seemed to understand something. So I said, I rushed to say, just like Shanghai, open the newspaper, full of "adultery," "seduction,"—these terms are too vulgar, they should be changed to "love" or "having physical relations"—nephew and daughter-in-law and uncle, nephew and aunt, as for lovers, illicit lovers... it's simply a daily occurrence, a trick that men and women all play. Such widespread benefits, such convenient avenues, naturally the credit of not having "chastity" haunting us!</p>
<p>The benefits of overthrowing "loyalty and martyrdom" seem to need no further words. There is no doubt that someone hit me in the face and gouged out one of my eyes, but because the other party is a violent person, I must first "calm down" and "tolerate" my anger to avoid suffering a "big" loss in front of my eyes. If it's too severe, I might not even be able to save my life, which is so dangerous. Taking a hundred steps back, even if one eye is gone, I still have one left, and my old life is still there. This is always worth it, and giving way first, then slowly thinking of ways to "resist for a long time," waiting for the day when I have the opportunity to take revenge. Therefore, only "villagers" are really stupid, and only that bunch of idiots who study literature go to give their lives away in vain, which is not worth pitying at all.</p>

<h3>Poem of a Lost Nation</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lun</p>
<p>Death Poem of a Remnant of the Ming Dynasty</p>
<p>It is said that a certain remnant of the Ming Dynasty, because he plotted to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, was arrested when the matter failed. At the time of execution, he raised his head and recited a poem: "The sound of the drum urges haste, the evening sun slants on the evening mountain, there is no overnight inn in the Yellow Springs, tonight I fall..." Before the sound was finished, his head had already fallen to the ground with the word "fall." Later generations mourned him, and all guessed that the next two words would be "whose home." Alas, how tragic.</p>
<p>Poem of a Remnant of the Goryeo Dynasty</p>
<p>Remnants of a lost nation, grieving over their own lives, easily move people when expressed in poetry. Below is a quatrain by the remnant of Goryeo, Nie Si Jin Tiaoyuan, saying goodbye to the elders of Jin Lu, writing of the pain of a lost nation, so sad that it almost makes one weep. At this time, our country's mountains and rivers are broken, and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. The path to a lost nation is probably not far away. Holding and reciting this poem, I shed tears of sound and grief all the more. The poem says:</p>
<p>Spring has finally returned, but the people have not,</p>
<p>Is the scenery of my hometown the same as before?</p>
<p>The swallows in the overturned nest are so desolate,</p>
<p>Whose house are they flying by now?</p>
<p>The golden jar is broken, and tears fall,</p>
<p>The Korean minister enters the Han Pass with sorrow,</p>
<p>The scenery of the Six Dynasties is the most beautiful,</p>
<p>My soul still chants of my homeland in dreams.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to be listed in the biographies of two-faced ministers,</p>
<p>My integrity remains in the pages of an exiled elder,</p>
<p>Where to go now that my country is broken and my family is gone?</p>
<p>I am wandering in Jiangnan like Li Guinian.</p>
<p>Returning from exile, I have nothing around me,</p>
<p>Alone and lonely on a desolate path,</p>
<p>I urge you not to say that Jiangnan is good,</p>
<p>For in the cries of the birds, there are partridges.</p>

<h3>Talking About Eggs</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Among human foods with the highest nutritional value, besides milk, eggs should be the top choice. Our country's dairy industry is not developed, and the distribution of milk is not widespread, so it is by no means something that everyone can enjoy. However, eggs, which are produced in large quantities, with the egg yolks not being used for consumption, but rather being exported in large quantities, shows how ignorant the Chinese people are of nutrition. Now, I will describe the nutritional value of eggs below:</p>
<p>Composition of Eggs: In order to make things clear for the readers, I will first describe the composition of eggs, and then describe their nutritional value. Eggs are composed of the eggshell, the egg yolk, and the egg white. On average, each egg weighs sixty grams, with the egg white accounting for six tenths and the egg yolk accounting for three tenths. As for their composition, there are differences due to breed and feed. On average, they contain 73% water, 14% protein, 12% fat, 1% minerals, and vitamins that are indispensable to human life.</p>
<p>In detail, the egg yolk contains more phosphorus-containing fat, and the protein is also twice as much as in the egg white. It has sufficient vitamins A and E, and a small amount of vitamins D and B. The minerals it contains include calcium, iron, phosphorus, copper, and a large amount of sulfur. All are organic matter with a very high absorption rate that has been converted from protein and fat.</p>
<p>The egg white contains fewer minerals, the main one being table salt. In addition, it contains a small amount of vitamin B and 0.5% sugar. From this, there is no doubt that the nutritional value of the egg yolk is higher than that of the egg white.</p>
<p>Nutritional Value of Eggs: The high nutritional value of eggs is known to everyone. According to Voit, one egg contains six grams of protein and six grams of fat, and its nutritional value is equivalent to forty grams of fatty meat or one hundred and fifty grams of milk.</p>
<p>The fat in the egg yolk is very easy to digest in the stomach and intestines, and its absorption rate reaches 78%. The absorption rate of protein reaches 97-98%. The digestibility of eggs is closely related to the length of cooking time and temperature. Fully cooked eggs require three and a half hours to be completely digested; medium-cooked eggs require three hours; roasted eggs require two and a half hours; raw eggs require the least time, only two hours. However, although raw eggs are easy to digest, they have a diarrhea effect due to the presence of anti-enzyme Antiltryptic (which dies when heated), and their absorption rate in the intestine is smaller than that of cooked eggs.</p>
<p>Recently, scientists have proved through experiments that copper can help iron produce hemoglobin. Now, both are found in eggs, and although the amount seems small (copper 0.000134%, iron 0.01%), its benefits to the human body are not insignificant.</p>
<p>The egg yolk is rich in vitamins A and E, and in terms of quantity, it contains ten times more than fresh milk. Therefore, it has now been proven that egg white can prevent rickets in children.</p>
<p>Among animal products, milk and eggs are the most nutritious. It would be even more beneficial if both were eaten together. This is because milk lacks iron, which eggs can supplement, and eggs lack phosphorus, which is not small in milk. Therefore, the combined use of these two items can be called the ideal top tonic. It is especially suitable for babies, pregnant women, and anemic people. This is because their minerals are very suitable for the construction of human tissues, and their chemical elements are all elements that make up muscles, bones, and blood.</p>
<p>Egg Spoilage: Since eggs are a tonic for humans, their organic matter, such as protein, is also suitable for bacteria. Moreover, the surface of the eggshell has countless small pores, and several kinds of rod-shaped bacteria, after drilling in, cause spoilage. Because eggs contain a large amount of sulfur, they often emit the odor of hydrogen sulfide. To prevent this, the surface of the eggshell can be thinly coated with oily substances such as Vaseline or lanolin, so that the pores are blocked and bacteria have no way to enter, so that they can be preserved for a long time.</p>
<p>Egg Identification: When you look through an egg, the bright one is fresh, and the dark one is old. Also, the one with water vapor bubbles at the blunt end is also evidence of freshness. Eggs that have been left for too long lose moisture due to evaporation, so their specific gravity decreases. We use this principle to place eggs in 5-10% salt water and determine whether they are fresh or old based on their floating state.</p>
<h3>Small Calculations</h3>
<p>— Fumin</p>
<p>｜How Many Combinations Are Possible?｜</p>
<p>Since the Lever Soap Factory started the "Match the Face" competition last year, there have been the "Guess the Mahjong Tiles" competition by Palm Olive Soap, the "Beauty Contest" by Children’s Face cream, and recently, the "Guess the Tower" competition by High Tower Cigarettes. To the average person, these riddles don't seem that difficult. But when we carefully calculate how many combinations are possible, we realize that winning these prizes is no less exciting than winning champagne!</p>
<p>For convenience, let's first reduce the number and create an example, and then extrapolate from there.</p>
<p>Suppose there are three types of towers: High Tower, Iron Tower, and Gold Tower, to be placed in three empty spaces. The following combinations are possible:</p>
<p>(First Item) (Second Item) (Third Item)</p>
<p>(1) High Tower | | | Iron Tower | | | Gold Tower</p>
<p>(2) High Tower | | | Gold Tower | | | Iron Tower</p>
<p>(3) Iron Tower | | | High Tower | | | Gold Tower</p>
<p>(4) Iron Tower | | | Gold Tower | | | High Tower</p>
<p>(5) Gold Tower | | | High Tower | | | Iron Tower</p>
<p>(6) Gold Tower | | | Iron Tower | | | High Tower</p>
<p>There are three possible variations for the first item, and only two variations for the second item because the item listed in the first item cannot be repeated (for example, if the High Tower is placed in the first item, then the High Tower cannot be placed in the second item). By the time we reach the third item, there is only one possibility left (for example, if the High Tower is placed in the first item and the Iron Tower is placed in the second item, then the third item must be the Gold Tower). Therefore, we know that:</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The number of items and the number of variations decrease in a hierarchical manner. Therefore, we know that the number of possible combinations is:</p>
<p>3 × 2 × 1 = 6 combinations.</p>
<p>From this, we can extrapolate that the "Guess the Tower" competition has</p>
<p>12 × 11 × 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 479,001,600 combinations.</p>
<p>The "Beauty Contest" has</p>
<p>8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320 combinations.</p>
<p>The "Match the Face" competition is slightly different from the above two. Although there are twenty-five faces, the same group cannot be used simultaneously, and only five faces are used each time. Let's assume the first type of face is used as the base, then we can get 1 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625 combinations.</p>
<p>When using the second type of face as the base, we can also get six hundred and twenty-five combinations. And each group has five types, so the result can be combined to</p>
<p>5 × 625 = 3125 combinations.</p>
<p>As for the Palm Olive Soap's "Match the Mahjong Tiles" competition, it is a very complex calculation and is not included in this small calculation, so we will not discuss it.</p>
<h3>New Year Jottings</h3>
<p>— Feifei</p>
<p>There are especially many people on the street, all dressed neatly - except for the beggars.</p>
<p>After all, people are intelligent and rational. They can think it through and see the bright side. Since they didn't have a good New Year last year, they must enjoy themselves this year.</p>
<p>University Investigation! Peiping University Students seek refuge to save the country!</p>
<p>Firecrackers resound like a string of pearls day and night, as if celebrating the death of Shirakawa with frenzied enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Gongs and drums, dong, dong, dong, further embellish the atmosphere of peace and prosperity. The movie theaters swallow and spit out batches of young gentlemen in suits and ties, graceful and charming modern girls, squeezed in between a group of awkward characters that the times can't push away or pull along, and a small number of scholars who go inside for artistic appreciation. They go in back-to-chest and come out back-to-chest. Liu Bowen's "Tui Bei Tu" prophecy might just be about this.</p>
<p>Gentlemen in silk robes and fur-lined mandarin jackets, accompanied by their wives, holding their eldest and second children… the first major event of the new year is to visit their father-in-law’s house for New Year's greetings; the second is to eat spring wine at the homes of old and new relatives.</p>
<p>Unable to think of novel wishes - after all, it's not as easy to write as the slogans of some commemorative festival. With a stroke of the pen, one starts spouting off ten or twenty sentences, plastered everywhere, sounding tragic and enthusiastic - but "Congratulations, get rich" is still the most appropriate. However, it is as follows:</p>
<p>"Congratulations, get rich."</p>
<p>"Everyone get rich."</p>
<p>"Gold ingots roll in," nonsense, should be changed to "Money stuffed into bags." But it doesn't matter literally; it's just like how "New Year's greetings" haven't been changed to "Bowing New Year's" yet. What's the difference between bowing and greeting, gold ingots and money? As long as it's something like that, the public will understand.</p>
<p>Sandalwood olives and spiced tea eggs are said to be symbols of gold ingots! I haven't researched the source of this classic, but in general, every family must prepare some during the New Year. When guests who come to give New Year's greetings see these kinds of things, they always eat one with a smile. If they can eat more because of the quantity, that's even better, as if a bunch of silver dollars had rolled into their pockets at the time.</p>
<p>Playing mahjong, playing poker, pushing pai gow, rolling dice... big wins or losses of fifty yuan per base, small games with copper coins coming and going. Really, there's "nothing to do" during the New Year, so play some games to relieve boredom. Who cares about the January 28th Incident or the August 13th Incident? Anyway, the government is still calmly engaging in long-term resistance.</p>
<p>The New Year has quietly slipped away. You clever people, have you had enough fun?</p>

<h3>Saving Someone From a Well</h3>
<p>Editor: I am of age and was preparing to get engaged to Ms. So-and-so, my close friend, in the near future. She is a virtuous, humorous, and emotional woman; eighteen years old; diligent at home and especially diligent in studying. However, in recent years, she has been unwell from time to time, plagued by minor illnesses. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it, until the last two months, she actually fell ill. Usually, when we met, I would certainly ask about her illness, but she always hid it from me. Unexpectedly, years of inaction have led to this major illness. She has consulted many famous doctors, she has taken many expensive Chinese medicines; but the results have sunk like a stone in the sea, with no effect at all. The day before yesterday, she returned to Yong with her parents by boat for treatment in a different location; only then did I know that she was suffering from tuberculosis. Ah! Terrible tuberculosis! After this sudden blow, I felt extremely uneasy in my mind. Driven by their love for their son, my parents also rejected this marriage. For my lifelong happiness and for the health of the nation's future, I certainly have the necessity to resolutely break it off. But I have the following questions in my heart:</p>
<p>(1) Suppose after she returns to Yong, she gets better in a year or six months; will there be any unexpected dangers in getting engaged to her again at that time?</p>
<p>(2) People suffering from tuberculosis certainly do not have the qualifications or possibility of marriage; but she is a rose that I have cultivated, and I am also the only lover in her heart. Unfortunately, she has contracted a serious illness and has already lost the joy of life; if I break it off, how can I bear it? How can I fill the sea of hate in the emotional realm?</p>
<p>(3) Is there no way for me to reduce her suffering?</p>
<p>Sir, your talent and wisdom are extraordinary and you will surely be able to get me out of this difficult situation. I long for your answer, like the sweet rain in a great drought. Sincerely, I respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Well-being. Respectfully, Huang Ye.</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Tuberculosis is becoming more and more prevalent in our society; although there are many reasons, the marriage of patients, which gives it more opportunities for heredity and transmission, is indeed a major reason. Therefore, we believe that this issue is of great value for public discussion.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is indeed very terrible, and the lives of patients are doomed sooner or later. Moreover, it can be inherited by descendants and transmitted to the people around them. Therefore, tuberculosis patients really do not have the qualifications and possibility of marriage. Because this can shorten his own life of "prolonging life with illness"; this can cause his spouse or even his family to perish together; and even if they have children, these children will certainly inherit this serious illness. Many radical eugenicists even advocate driving tuberculosis patients out of our human community; although the words are too radical, they cannot be said to be unreasonable. Therefore, whether it is a man or a woman, if it has been proven that they have tuberculosis, we really do not have the possibility of marrying them under any conditions or circumstances. Therefore, we advise Huang Jun to resolutely refuse to get engaged. Saving someone from a well is not worth the effort; moreover, in the end, you still can't save the person.</p>
<p>However, according to the first question raised by Huang Jun, the Ms. So-and-so's illness does not seem to be very critical: and the letter only said "she has consulted many famous doctors and taken many expensive Chinese medicines" and did not mention consulting a Western doctor or taking Western medicines. We think it is a good idea to ask a high-ranking Western doctor to diagnose and see if she has tuberculosis; even if it is tuberculosis, whether it has reached an irreversible point. It is not known if it is not tuberculosis, even if it is tuberculosis, as long as it is still in the early stages, then there may not be a hope of recovery. As for getting married again after it is indeed cured, there will certainly be no danger.</p>
<p>Finally, we know that the most afraid thing for tuberculosis patients is "worry"; so if the diagnosis result shows that there is still hope for treatment, then Huang Jun can get engaged to her. This can reduce her worries and promote his recovery. Fortunately, if it is discovered later that she is incurable, the marriage contract can still be legally dissolved.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>A Family of Scholars (Continuation 14)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Youzhong had always regarded Daiqiu as an elder. He embraced and kissed her with the status of an uncle, and his heart was very pure: although she had expressed "not wanting to call him uncle, but wanting to call him older brother," he only regarded it as the foolish words of a normal child. Who knew that she already had deep thoughts at that time? He was really as stupid as a dumb ox!</p>
<p>She had clearly expressed her shameless behavior - a twelve-point disdain for his personality - and he became extremely annoyed. He resented himself for not being tempted by her mother, for not being threatened by her mother, which led to this big mistake. He lost the love of a flower-like girl and became a tool for a middle-aged woman to vent her desires. She was a pure virgin, facing him with sincere affection. She wanted to break the traditional class concept and fall in love with a man one generation older than her. Who knew that he would be unmoved and instead fall in love with a lascivious woman, and her love rival was not an outsider, but her own mother, which was such a painful thing!</p>
<p>Youzhong felt sad for her, and when he looked back at himself, he felt it was not worth it at all. Incest between uncle and sister-in-law and having a love affair with a niece are both unethical things related to ethics; but this niece is raised by Ruohua and someone unknown, and is not my brother's own flesh and blood. If we talk about blood, there is no direct relationship with me. If I marry her as my wife, I can still have a strong argument. Ruohua is my brother's lover, and I have no hope of growing old together with her, and I can't think of a second reason besides venting my desires. If I had a love affair with Daiqiu and my brother found out, even if he didn't agree, stopping me from marrying her would be the end of it, and he would never lose the feelings of brotherhood: if my brother knew about my improper behavior with Ruohua, he would definitely fight me desperately. At that time, I would only have a dead end. The more I think about the mistakes I made, the more annoyed I get!</p>
<p>Youzhong stared blankly at Daiqiu with his eyes wide open, his heart spinning like a wheel. Daiqiu turned her back to him, silently watching the sea outside the window, the color of the water gradually changing from azure blue to yellow, appearing turbid. She couldn't hold back her tears, which fell like broken pearls. Youzhong saw her shoulders shaking and felt as painful as if he was being cut with a knife. He was just about to tell her about how Ruohua had coerced and threatened him last night to seek her forgiveness when he suddenly heard Ruohua calling her daughter and walking into the room, suddenly interrupting what he was about to say.</p>
<p>"There are many small boats catching yellow croaker in the sea over there, go and see! We've already passed Zhenhai Port in Ningbo, and we'll arrive in Shanghai by dawn tomorrow." Ruohua said to them as she entered the room. Youzhong was afraid that she would see Daiqiu's tear stains, so he turned around to block her view, constantly perfunctorily answering her, wanting to accompany her out to prevent her from questioning her daughter. Who knew that she insisted on taking her daughter with her, and when her daughter turned her face away, she asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"Why are your eyes so red?"</p>
<p>"It seems like a grain of sand blew into my eye, Mom, blow it for me!" Daiqiu opened her bright red eyelids towards her mouth.</p>
