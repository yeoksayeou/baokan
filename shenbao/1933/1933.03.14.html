<p>昨日本報載駐日公使蔣作賓氏之談話有謂一國聯旣不制裁日本而熱河之抵抗情形又如此中國前途大可憂慮然終有新的途徑必不如行路般以致無路可走也至所謂新的途徑如何蔣氏之答語則閃爍其辭謂余對此未有成見須日内北上謁蔣委員長再由中央及蔣委員長决定對策在此熱河淪陷中央且正高呼總動員抵抗到底之際而奉召回國之蔣作賓氏乃突有如斯之談話斯誠至足驚異</p>
<p>蔣氏之所謂新的途徑者究何在乎在蔣氏之談話中已明白昭示吾人以國聯决不能裁制日本中國自已之事希望國聯援助出發點不過爲依賴心矣亦已明白照示吾人以抵抗當然爲正當之自衛但照熱河抵抗情形而論我軍不戰而退對日前途却大可憂慮矣旣不爲呼助國聯復不爲自力抵抗然則所謂新的途徑者究何在乎抑且蔣氏旣已肯定另有新的途徑在矣而又鄭重聲明爲未有成見迷離恍惚未盡之言隠若可聞則吾人蓋可斷定蔣氏之所敵猛襲義院口我軍奮勇迎擊昨晨激戰頗烈</p>

<p>北平蔣閻晤後决定閻負察綏治安責任必要　閻即　駐大同擔謂新的途徑决不爲無的而放矢尤非爲個人之想像</p>
<p>由於十一日宋子文氏所發表之談話吾人知目前關於中日交涉正盛傳直接談判以及設立中立區等之謠言而日本軍部亦曾發表非正式之聲明要點即爲（一）力圖中止排日在適當時期開始直接交涉（二）劃長城以内地區爲中立區域日軍將止於長城以北更據電通社電訉由於華北時局之變换日本軍部目前正考慮對華新政策其最要之一點即深信華北時局終熄反日反满空氣日本方面將於適當時期開始直接交涉上述種種固爲日本軍閥片面之宣傳然而蔣作賓氏新自日本歸來吾人不能不深懼其爲日本軍閥所麻醉遂認爲我國今日對於日帝國主義者之侵略已有新的應付之途徑果若是則所謂新的途徑者即妥恊耳即直接交涉耳亦即亡國之死途耳</p>
<p>總之吾人認定當前惟一救國之道厥惟鬥爭厥惟動員全民族以民族革命戰爭答復日帝國主義者之侵略暴行舍此而外皆爲苟安旦夕之下策期待國聯之外交政策已使東北四省淪亡於日帝國主義者鐵蹄蹂躪之下矣新的途徑則又如何吾人切盼政府當局切實認清當前之情勢於其所謂新的途徑作鄭重之考慮</p>

<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan's Chief of Staff Zhang Weifan telegraphed from Ping this morning, stating that our troops launched a two-pronged attack on the enemy's left and right flanks this morning, capturing their artillery positions, killing and capturing many enemy soldiers, seizing many cannons, and completely burning their ammunition and supply vehicles. The enemy is now under our pincer attack and is being resolved in an encircled manner. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After suffering heavy losses outside Xifengkou, Beiping, the enemy has reinforced with the Setagawa and Harahara units, as well as more than 3,000 puppet troops, and is advancing towards our army again. Our army is still defending its original position. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Song Zheyuan telegraphed the fierce battle situation at Xifengkou: (1) Dong Shengtang's regiment has detoured to the enemy's rear and occupied Sanjiazi and Xiaoxifengkou, cooperating with Wang Zhibang's brigade on the front to attack the enemy on the western heights of Xifengkou. (2) Wang Changhai's regiment detoured to the enemy's rear and occupied Baitaizi and Langdongzi, cooperating with Tong Guangze's brigade on the front to attack the enemy on the eastern high mountains of Xifengkou. (3) Wang Kunshan's battalion occupied Baitaizi and has destroyed and blocked the Rehe thoroughfare to prevent enemy reinforcements. (4) The enemy's current position has been subjected to our fierce attacks, and morale is low. They are all within our encirclement, and we are preparing to annihilate the enemy on the 13th and 14th. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan telephoned to report that our army's operations at Xifengkou have been quite victorious. Tong's brigade led its troops out of Dongjiakou, and Zhao's brigade led its troops out of Panjiakou, both detouring to the enemy's rear and cutting the enemy into two sections. The fierce battles have intensified in recent days, killing countless enemies and capturing more than 500 enemy soldiers, seizing many guns, cannons, and various military supplies. The enemy's stored grain and ammunition near Xifengkou have all been burned by our army. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Song Zheyuan sent three telegrams to Nanjing on the 12th, reporting the battle situation as follows: (1) The enemy attacking our Xifengkou this time is the Japanese 13th and 14th Brigades. After three days of fierce fighting with us, the enemy suffered heavy casualties. On the morning of the 11th, they launched a fierce attack on us for three hours but were repelled. During the fierce battle yesterday, our Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu led the special service battalion to supervise the battle. Battalion Commander Wang Baoliang died in battle. The brigade commander was injured but continued to supervise the battle without retreating. At 9:00 AM today, the enemy used concentrated artillery fire for three hours to cover their two infantry regiments, using a wave-like formation to engage in hand-to-hand combat more than ten times with Feng's division's positions on the side of our Xifengkou. They gained and lost ground repeatedly, with enemy corpses everywhere. Currently, they are in a stalemate, and another two infantry regiments have been dispatched to attack the enemy's rear from Gaijiakou. (2) Our battle with the enemy at Xifengkou has been exceptionally fierce in recent days. On the evening of the 11th, our Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu led a brigade of soldiers to detour out of Panjiakou to attack the enemy's right flank and rear. Our Tong brigade detoured out of Dongjiakou to attack the enemy's left flank and rear. Both detoured to the enemy's artillery positions that night, capturing many enemy artillery soldiers and seizing many cannons, as well as completely burning their ammunition and supplies. The enemy is now under our pincer attack and is being resolved in an encircled manner. (3) Last night, despite the thinness, our Brigade Commander Zhao Dengyu, injured, led our Dong and Wang regiments to attack the enemy's rear from Panjiakou. That night, they occupied Sanjiazi, Xiaoxifengkou, Mengyanzi, Taizi, and the high ground west of Dazifengkou, advancing from north to south. Brigade Commander Tong Zeguang led Wang's regiment to advance southwest from the Gaomen Pass along the southwestern highlands of the Great Wall. Another Tong regiment was dispatched to cut off the concave passage north of Beitaizi, blocking the enemy's rear. All units advanced together, completely intercepting and burning all kinds of supply items for the enemy. Afterwards, they fiercely attacked the enemy's artillery positions, killing countless enemies and seizing many cannons. Wang Zhibang was ordered to launch a full-scale attack from the front of Xifengkou to the north, forming an encirclement and attacking from the front and rear. A bloody battle is currently underway. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Zhu Qinglan telegraphed to various generals, reporting on Song Zheyuan's annihilation of the enemy at Xifengkou, saying that more than half of the enemy had been hacked to death by our troops and were begging for mercy in panic. They are now surrendering their weapons. After this battle, the enemy has been almost completely wiped out at Xifengkou. (Central News Agency Telegram, Morning of the 14th)</p>
<p>Beiping, Xifengkou, 8:00 PM on the 13th, telegraphed that our Song Zheyuan's troops, Tong and Zhao brigades, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's 13th and 14th Brigades on the morning of the 13th, killing more than 6,000 enemies, seizing 18 cannons, 7 tanks, and more than 5,000 rifles. The enemy's rear was cut off, and they were completely defeated. If the enemy cannot reinforce within the 13th and 14th, then the remaining more than 10,000 people can be completely resolved. (Central News Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Japanese Allied News Agency Telegram) The detailed report of the fierce battle at Xifengkou is as follows: On the night of the 11th, the Chinese army launched a large-scale offensive, advancing towards the rear of the Japanese army's second position, taking the form of encircling the Japanese army's position. On the morning of the 12th, a fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Hattori cavalry unit immediately unfolded. The Japanese generals and soldiers were in the encirclement of the Chinese army, and because the telephone line was cut off, communication with the headquarters was cut off and no reinforcements could be requested. Captain Nakahira and 35 other soldiers were killed in battle. At that time, the Matsuno unit rushed from the rear to participate in the battle. The barrels of the Japanese army's heavy artillery were dripping with red blood, and the fierceness of the battle was beyond words. In this battle, 25 Japanese soldiers, including Captain Katakura, were killed. The Chinese army also suffered heavy losses. On the night of the 11th, the Nakamura branch team of the Hattori unit was also attacked by the Chinese army and immediately responded to the battle. The Chinese army had more than ten times the strength of the Japanese army, and its momentum was very fierce, randomly firing machine guns and mortars. The Japanese army fought bravely in the rain of artillery shells. Captain Takada, using the ancestral sword passed down through generations, bathed in blood and charged into battle, was shot and seriously injured. Sergeants Moriki, Hitoshi Yamada, and Sanjun Cao saw the captain injured and went to rescue him, but Takada ordered them sternly to attack the enemy. As a result, the three rushed towards the Chinese army and were shot and fell one after another. Captain Takada has now been transported to the rear, and his injuries are quite serious. (12th)</p>
<p>(Japanese Allied News Agency Telegram) On the 12th, the Chinese army's attacks on the Japanese army in the Xifengkou area have reached several times. Their momentum has not diminished at all but has instead increased. The development of the Japanese army in that area is completely unpredictable, and the situation is extremely serious. (12th)</p>
<p>(Japanese Allied News Agency Telegram) On the night of the 10th, the Chinese army fiercely attacked the Hattori unit. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, they temporarily retreated. At 8:30 PM, they added fresh troops and launched a large-scale attack. They are currently engaged in battle. (12th)</p>
<p>Two Song's wounded soldiers were transported to Ping for medical treatment. Second, the Beiping military news stated that Song Zheyuan telegraphed that the fierce battles have been very intense in recent days. The enemy confronts us with sharp weapons, and we fight back with blood and flesh. As of now, more than 1,500 people have been killed or injured. The frontline hospital is full. After receiving the telegram, the Beiping Military Branch has dispatched cars from the Logistics Directorate to transport them to Ping for medical treatment. (Central News Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Telegraphs Ping Requesting Supplies</p>
<p>Beiping, Sun Dianying telegraphed Ping, stating that the enemy is fiercely attacking the Weichang Chuizishan area with a large force. After many days of bloody battle, they have been repeatedly repelled. Since the 11th, the enemy has attacked our right wing, attempting to advance westward through Sandaoyingzi and Guojiatun, but has also failed. In recent days, the enemy has suffered repeated heavy losses and is now trembling with fear and not advancing. Guojiatun and Fengning Dage are the only ways to enter Chahar. Troops have been dispatched to defend them, and they are determined not to retreat an inch, regardless of sacrifice. However, supplies and ammunition have not yet arrived. The wounded have no medicine, and many soldiers are barefoot. It is hoped that the urgently needed items will be sent overnight for defense. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Sun Dianying's representative in Nanjing, Lu Hongkui, stated that his army is engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Sandaoyingzi area and urgently needs assistance. He is scheduled to go north to see Chiang Kai-shek on the 14th to request that elite troops be quickly transferred to launch a large-scale counteroffensive and provide supplies and ammunition, or to clearly designate a location to reorganize his troops and plan a counteroffensive. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Sun Dianying's representative talked about the recent few days that fewer telegrams have come from the front because the water and electricity of the radio station are lacking, so they must strive to save. The central government's supplies of weapons and ammunition have been transported to Beiping, but because they must pass through high mountains when detouring from Ping to the front, it is very difficult. The rumor that his army has retreated from Tuanchang to Dolon Nor is purely a misunderstanding. Because our army is preparing to pressure the enemy to the northwest of Chengde for strategic reasons, and Weichang cannot go directly to Chengde, it must retreat slightly before it can attack. Now, Army Commander Sun has taken office as the commander of the Sixth Army Corps, and the troops of 囗囗囗 etc. are all under the command of this army. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published the remarks of Mr. Jiang Zuobin, the minister to Japan, stating that since the League of Nations does not sanction Japan and the resistance in Rehe is so poor, China's future is very worrying. However, there is ultimately a new path that will not be like walking a road to the point of having no road to walk. As for what the so-called new path is, Mr. Jiang's answer was evasive, saying that he had no preconceived ideas on this and would go north to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the next few days, and then the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek would decide on the countermeasures. At a time when Rehe has fallen and the central government is loudly calling for total mobilization to resist to the end, Mr. Jiang Zuobin, who has been summoned back to China, suddenly made such remarks, which is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>What is the so-called new path that Mr. Jiang is talking about? In Mr. Jiang's remarks, he has clearly shown us that the League of Nations will never sanction Japan. China's own affairs are hoping that the League of Nations will help, and the starting point is nothing more than a mentality of dependence. It has also clearly shown us that resistance is of course a legitimate self-defense, but judging from the resistance situation in Rehe, our army is retreating without fighting, and the future is very worrying. Since it is not to call for help from the League of Nations, nor is it to resist on its own, then what is the so-called new path? Moreover, since Mr. Jiang has already affirmed that there is another new path, and has solemnly stated that he has no preconceived ideas, and his words are vague and unfinished, then we can conclude that what Mr. Jiang is trying to say is what others cannot say.</p>
<p>The enemy fiercely attacked Yiyuan Pass, and our army bravely met the attack. The fierce battle was quite intense yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Shell Our Jiukou Pass Position</p>
<p>Beiping, 11th: Three Japanese planes flew over our Jiukou Pass and Yiyuan Pass for a long time, reconnoitering and heading east. At 10:00 AM on the 10th, two enemy planes came to Lengkou to reconnoiter. After 3:00 PM, another plane came and dropped three bombs. On the 12th, the enemy at Jiukou Pass fired more than 30 shells at our position. On the 10th, 300 to 400 Japanese infantry and several artillery pieces engaged in a fierce battle for several hours with the forward troops of a certain division of our army at Jielingshan outside Jielingkou, and were finally repelled by our army. They are still in confrontation. There is no enemy situation in Jilin Kou and other places. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: With the loss of Rehe, the various passes of the Great Wall have suddenly become tense. At around 4:00 PM on the 11th, enemy combined infantry and cavalry forces of 400 to 500 were discovered outside Yiyuan Pass. The vanguard of their troops advanced to the vicinity of the Mountain God Temple north of the pass and were fiercely attacked by a part of our Jin regiment and the Du regiment in cooperation. After about an hour of fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated. Our army is still firmly guarding its original position. On the morning of the 12th, two Japanese planes came to Yiyuan Pass to reconnoiter, and three more came in the afternoon, circling and dropping bombs. Fortunately, there was no major damage. On the same day, the enemy at Jiukou Pass fired more than ten shells at our position. At 3:00 PM, another 200 to 300 enemies came to attack Yiyuan Pass. At the same time, there were also more than 100 enemies at Kou Dongbei Banchangyu Kou fighting against the righteous army of Zheng Guilin. The two sides fought fiercely for about three hours until 12:00 PM, when the enemy retreated and Banchangyu was also occupied by our righteous army. Also, on the morning of the 13th, a large number of enemy reinforcements arrived and used four planes to drop bombs and fiercely attack our Yiyuan Pass position. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely to resist, and the enemy was defeated repeatedly. Our army finally repelled the enemy for five or six miles in the smoke and artillery fire.

<p>No Major Changes in Personnel of the Military Branch</p>
<p>Beiping, because of the fierce battles in Gubeikou and Xifengkou in recent days, which urgently need deployment, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Baoding last night with Luo Wengan and Yang Yongtai, and plans to stay in Baoding for a while and not come to Ping for the time being. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Li Liejun came to Ping from Zhangjiakou this morning and visited He Yingqin in the afternoon. He will go to Baoding to visit Chiang Kai-shek tonight to convey Feng Yuxiang's opinions. Feng Yuxiang still advocates firm resistance to Japan. Li Liejun will urge Chiang Kai-shek and Feng Yuxiang to meet and discuss everything after arriving in Baoding. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, after Chiang and Yan met, it was decided that Yan would be responsible for the security of Chahar and Suiyuan. If necessary, Yan will immediately reside in Datong, saying that the new path will definitely not be aimless, and even less of an individual's imagination.</p>
<p>From the remarks made by Song Ziwen on the 11th, we know that there are rumors about direct negotiations and the establishment of a neutral zone regarding the Sino-Japanese negotiations. The Japanese military has also issued an informal statement, the main points of which are: (1) To try to stop anti-Japanese activities and start direct negotiations at an appropriate time; (2) To demarcate the area within the Great Wall as a neutral zone, and the Japanese army will stop north of the Great Wall. According to a Teletong Agency dispatch, due to the changes in the situation in North China, the Japanese military is currently considering a new policy towards China, the most important point of which is the deep belief that the anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo atmosphere in North China will eventually subside, and the Japanese side will start direct negotiations at an appropriate time. The above-mentioned are all one-sided propaganda by Japanese warlords. However, Jiang Zuobin has just returned from Japan, and we cannot but deeply fear that he has been anesthetized by the Japanese warlords and believes that our country today has a new way to deal with the aggression of Japanese imperialism. If so, then the so-called new path is compromise, direct negotiations, and the path to national subjugation.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that the only way to save the country at present is through struggle, to mobilize the entire nation to respond to the aggressive atrocities of Japanese imperialism with a national revolutionary war. Anything else is a short-sighted, temporary expedient. Expecting the League of Nations' diplomatic policy has already caused the four northeastern provinces to fall under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism. What about the new path? We earnestly hope that the government authorities will earnestly recognize the current situation and give serious consideration to the so-called new path.</p>

<p>Tokyo, The Japanese Emperor has handed over the notification of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations submitted today by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to the Privy Council for deliberation. (13th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo, The Privy Council held its first review meeting at 2:30 p.m. today to deliberate on the withdrawal from the League of Nations. The attendees were Second Secretaries Hori Kuretake and Muto, and from the government side, Director of the Legislative Bureau Hori Kirei, Director General Kanamori, and Director of the Treaty Bureau Matsudaira. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 p.m. (13th Japan Federation News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, The German heavy industry mouthpiece, the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, commented on Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, saying that Japan's military actions in Manchuria are constantly expanding. We believe that until now, Japan has completely disregarded all the resolutions adopted by the League of Nations for a peaceful resolution. Therefore, Japan's withdrawal will not damage the credibility of the League of Nations. However, even if Japan withdraws, it will not help solve the problem, because Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that any member of the League of Nations may withdraw from the League after giving two years' prior notice, but must fulfill all its international obligations and all obligations under this Covenant. The true meaning of this provision is difficult for politicians and jurists to agree on in their interpretation, and people have different opinions on Japan's future attitude towards this issue. However, there is one main point that must be known about this matter, that is, the vacancy of the permanent member of the Administrative Council left by Japan's withdrawal should be filled by China in accordance with the law, because among the Asian countries that are members of the League of Nations, China is the most important besides Japan. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, Matsuoka told the Manchester Guardian reporter today that business people should handle some international negotiations on behalf of diplomatic circles. The cotton industries of Britain and Japan must never compete with each other forever. If the cotton industries on both sides of Manchester and Osaka can jointly discuss this situation, he believes that a solution can be found. If China is regarded as a promising market and it is believed that developing the Chinese market can solve the economic difficulties of the West, then this is an unstable theory. Even if engaged in the development of the Chinese market, the low living standards of Chinese farmers will make it impossible for them to absorb large quantities of products from other countries. At the same time, if China progresses and becomes industrialized, it will be a competitor of Western products rather than a consumer of them. Matsuoka continued to mention his joint broadcasting speech with Guo Taiqi yesterday regarding the Far East dispute, saying that if he had known that Guo would also speak, he would definitely not have been willing to speak at the same time, because after the last session of the League of Nations Assembly, he was not in the same forum to discuss this issue with the Chinese. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Foreign affairs circles believe that Guo Taiqi and Matsuoka were invited to give radio speeches on the same day in England. Guo's speech won the sympathy of most of the audience, while Matsuoka's speech was simply rogue, causing the audience to be impatient and shouting to overthrow the robber-style Japanese empire. Matsuoka was quite frustrated afterwards, saying that if he had known that Guo would also speak on the same day, he would rather have refused the invitation. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>China Should Be Friendly with Russia</p>
<p>Nanjing, The National Government held the weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th. Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuantxian, Niu Yongjian, Wang Yongbin, Zhu Jiaju, Zhou Zhenlin, Enkebatu, Li Yuanding, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaotsu, Huang Musong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 500 members of the National Government attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Sun Ke reported that there were several major international events that could be reported recently. The United States recently experienced a financial crisis, with bank runs across the country. This was due to the severe global economic panic and unemployment problems, and the fundamentally unsound organization of the banking system in capitalist countries. The government has issued an emergency order prohibiting cash flow, and the crisis is gradually subsiding. Germany has been governed by the left-leaning Social Democratic Party since the war, which has been unable to break through the national crisis. Now that the National Socialist Party is in power, it is bound to lean to the right, and its influence will make the relationship between Germany and Russia and France increasingly worse. France has recently changed its foreign policy. Regarding the September 18th Incident, France initially sided with Japan, but recently passed a report to suppress Japan, one to ally with Britain and one to safeguard the League of Nations. This shows that international relations are purely based on interests. Sun Yat-sen advocated allying with Russia because Britain, the United States, and Japan are not in line with our policies. The Soviet Union and we have the same interests on the point of opposing Japan. We should be friendly with Russia. In addition, the internal problems of various countries are extremely serious, but their governments all have great determination to break through the difficulties. The decisive measures taken by the United States and Germany to deal with the situation are clear examples. Our country is currently facing a serious national crisis, and the government should actively take on the responsibility of saving the country and lead the people to fight to the death in order to find a way out. The ceremony ended at 10:00 a.m. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Recently, the Hitler cabinet in Germany has followed Fascism to preside over the national government, and the national situation is improving day by day. Italy is also admired for the grand construction of its construction due to Mussolini's comprehensive management of the government and his efforts to govern. The people of our country should also learn from the spirit of others, eliminate prejudices, consolidate the central government, and jointly face the national crisis.

<p>Rumors of a Five-Power Conference in Italy Run Rampant</p>
<p>The General Atmosphere of the Disarmament Conference Remains Extremely Pessimistic</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Withdraw, Conference Postponed for Six Weeks</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th (National Dispatch) - Italian representative Aloisi, representing Prime Minister Mussolini, reportedly spoke with British Prime Minister MacDonald this morning, suggesting a Five-Power Conference in Italy to discuss the redistribution of European territory. The French are strongly opposed and are pressing the British Prime Minister to reject it. However, it is rumored that MacDonald plans to personally meet with Mussolini in Italy, hoping Italy will revise its disarmament demands. According to British sources, no firm arrangements have been made.</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (Reuters) - Several country representatives were very active here today regarding the Disarmament Conference, but the general atmosphere remains extremely pessimistic. After a lengthy conversation with Italian representative Aloisi, British Prime Minister MacDonald met with German representative Nadolny. French representative Paul-Boncour also met several times with representatives of the Little Entente (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania) and the Polish Foreign Minister. Tonight, representatives from British overseas autonomous territories will hold a meeting, attended by the Prime Minister, to explain the current situation. Attendees include Canadian representative Fasken and Australian representative Bruce.</p>
<p>Geneva, 12th (Havas) - After the Italian representative visited British Prime Minister MacDonald, discussions arose, with some suggesting that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intended to promote a political conference of representatives from a small number of countries in Italy. However, the British delegation assured that this Italian suggestion had become a thing of the past because such a conference was impractical and feared that countries would oppose it for political reasons, thus rendering it fundamentally untenable. The impracticality stems from the fact that MacDonald had invited German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to meet in Geneva. Since both leaders had not rejected the invitation, why would the various authorities go to Italy for a conference? The political reason is that if a conference of a small number of countries were convened according to Italian proposals, countries concerned about the fate of the conference would become suspicious. Currently, this plan has failed, so Italy may not admit to having made this suggestion. British sources say MacDonald has not decided on any attitude. Rumors suggest MacDonald leans towards postponing the Disarmament Conference for six weeks, but this is unreliable. British sources claiming that MacDonald has not made any decisions may be trying to deny this rumor. Conversely, some say Italian representative Aloisi, last night, and the American representative, seemed to be advising Germany to accept a compromise solution, but the German representative rejected it outright. This is more likely. As for France, it remains in a wait-and-see attitude. Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour probably sees no need to emerge before Tuesday.</p>
<p>Paris, 13th (National Dispatch) - French newspapers predict that Germany and Italy will soon withdraw from the Disarmament Conference, saying that there are already rumors in Geneva. "Le Petit Parisien" published this rumor, stating that French sources with good information in Paris and Geneva are pessimistic about the overall situation and say that there is no hope of mending the rift between France and Germany/Italy.</p>

<p>The Pope Calls for Peace</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Reuters) - The Pope, when appointing six new cardinals in a secret consistory today, expressed grave concern over the world situation. The Pope lamented the rampant nationalism, the fraternal struggles, and the political, social, and religious enemies seeking to profit from the economic distress of tens of millions of workers. The Pope exhorted all to pay attention to the great dangers threatening the civilization of all countries.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Reuters) - The German National Socialist Party's stormtroopers invaded the demilitarized zone last week, alarming France. Today, the troop occupied Speyer and Cologne. The mayor of Cologne, Achter, has been replaced by the Nazi Ries.</p>
<p>Hamburg, 12th (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Neurath today delivered a sternly worded speech to the local Eastern Alliance Club, strongly criticizing the Treaty of Versailles, saying that countries still tend to form coalitions to oppose Germany. The world must now choose between two paths: one, Germany moving towards fairness and freedom, thereby becoming a barrier to European peace; or two, Europe descending into hell.</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th (Havas) - The League of Nations Administrative Council was originally scheduled to discuss the Westerplatte issue (Westerplatte is a peninsula near the Free City of Danzig where Poland recently increased its military presence) at this morning's meeting, but due to the late distribution of the report, British Foreign Minister Simon requested that the issue be postponed for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Washington, 12th (Havas) - The situation in Central Europe is grave, and the tension between Germany and Poland is causing great concern in the State Department. While this concern has not been publicly expressed, it can be seen in the newspapers' tone. It is said that President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and the chief U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, will soon discuss this matter. Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - The conflict between the Free City of Danzig and Poland has sparked strong criticism in Germany. Danzig protested Poland's dispatch of troops to Westerplatte. Now Poland is also protesting Danzig's aircraft flying over Westerplatte. However, Danzig replied that the area is part of Danzig's territory, so Danzig aircraft have the right to fly over it.</p>
<p>Strasbourg, 12th (Havas) - After German National Socialist stormtroopers occupied barracks in Kehl (opposite Strasbourg) in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, the French Public Security Bureau deployed personnel to monitor fortresses and military training barracks. Today, the Bureau arrested a German who confessed to being a German spy.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, 12th (Havas) - The German ambassador to Denmark protested to the Danish government about the unfriendly attitude of Danish newspapers. Commenting on this matter, a conservative newspaper said that there would be a demonstration in Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark, on Tuesday to oppose the province's current borders (after the European war, the northeastern part of the province was voted to Denmark). This action has serious implications for Danish-German relations, at least equivalent to the so-called unfriendly attitude of Danish newspapers. A socialist newspaper said that Denmark, as a small country, is weaker than Germany, but socialist newspapers will never be silenced by force. Socialists never resort to violence against political opponents, while German socialist comrades are ravaged by terrorism.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Havas) - A new tariff agreement has been signed between France and Sweden. Stockholm newspapers have expressed great welcome. An unofficial mouthpiece of the Social Democratic Party stated that the negotiation process of the new Franco-Swedish tariff agreement was excellent and realistic, and the Swedish Parliament will approve it.</p>
<p>Hindenburg Orders Restoration of the Former Imperial Flag</p>
<p>To Be Displayed Alongside the National Socialist Party Flag</p>
<p>Representing Past Glory and Today's Revival</p>
<p>Hitler Wins Prussian Election</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - The socialist and communist majority in today's city council has been eliminated. The nationalist faction won a majority in this city election, gaining 113 out of 225 seats. In the city election of Cologne, the government party still holds a minority, winning only 44 out of 95 seats. In other towns in East Prussia, the National Socialist Party has already won an absolute majority.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (National Dispatch) - In yesterday's city elections in Prussia, government parties won too many seats in important areas. In Berlin, the local party won a majority for the first time since the war, with 88 National Socialists, 27 Nationalists, 2 German People's Party members, 1 Christian Socialist, 49 Social Democrats, 44 Communists, 11 Center Party members, and 5 Democrats.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas) - Dictatorship Down. Germany Changes Flag. President Hindenburg today ordered the restoration of the black, white, and red imperial flag. The original text is as follows: "Today, across Germany, black, white, and red flags are flown at half-mast to commemorate the martyrs of the European war. This President hereby orders that from tomorrow until the national flag issue is fully resolved, the black, white, and red flag and the swastika flag shall be displayed side by side. These two flags, one to remind people of the glory of the former German Confederation, and the other representing the revival of the German nation, together represent the nation's strength and the people's unity. Furthermore, all military institutions shall henceforth only display the German war flag."</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - German Chancellor Hitler gave a broadcast speech announcing that the black, red, and gold republican flag would be abolished, and the old black, white, and red flag would be restored as the German national flag. He also said that the swastika flag and the imperial flag would enjoy the same honor and should be displayed together in all public places. Hitler called this order a symbol of the union of old traditions and the youth of the national revolution and ordered that these two flags should be flown in all public places across the country for three days starting on Sunday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Havas) - From this morning, the black, white, and red imperial national flag and the National Socialist Party flag have been flown on all federal government departments and public institutions. However, military institutions fly the black, white, and red army flag with an iron cross in the middle and the upper corner removed from the presidential flag. The presidential flag, formerly black, red, and gold with a Prussian eagle in the middle, has now been replaced by the army flag. The German merchant flag has not been changed because the merchant flag is of an international nature. The President's flag change order is limited to land and does not extend to the sea.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - Hitler Admonishes: Terror Still Does Not Stop. Chancellor Hitler again strictly warned National Socialist Party members not to engage in terrorism, saying that the victory of the National Socialist Party should not be used to settle petty grievances. Now is the time to plan for the national interest, restore absolute safety, and pay particular attention to the interests of the business community. Hitler's warning included the following: "Only when our enemies commit violence will you relentlessly destroy their resistance."</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Reuters) - The administrative committee of the Wartburg state last night ordered the mass arrest of communists. Communists were dragged from the forest, scantily clad, and their whereabouts are unknown. In Stuttgart alone, the state capital, over two hundred communists have been detained. The "Berliner Tageblatt," which was banned from publication on March 1, has now been republished. The leader of the National Socialist stormtroopers in North Bavaria, Streicher, telegraphed that the administrative committee of North Bavaria had lined up to arrest famous political enemies in Nuremberg and take over the administration of the province. The newly appointed Bavarian Interior Administrator, Wegler, has announced that Streicher has no right to issue this order. Streicher has already traveled by car to Munich to request administrative power over North Bavaria.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - Today it was confirmed that Bela Kun, the dictator of the Hungarian Red Republic after the European War, and Hörsing, the leader of the Saxon Red Revolution in 1921, had entered Germany from Russia with the intention of organizing communist activities.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (National Dispatch) - Commemorating the Fallen, the Army's Bearing Is Imposing. Today, Germany held a grand memorial service for the generals and soldiers who died in the European war. All public and private buildings were decorated with the black, white, and red imperial flag to commemorate the two million soldiers who sacrificed themselves under the imperial flag. At the same time, memorial services were held across the country, presided over by veterans of the European war. All patriotic organizations and the Red Cross participated. In Berlin, the President and Prime Minister led the entire cabinet in a solemn memorial service at the Berlin National Theater. After the service, Hindenburg, wearing his old general's uniform and the former Prussian Black Eagle badge, reviewed the drills of the National Socialist stormtroopers, steel helmet association, and other patriotic organizations and veterans in the square in front of the theater. After the review, he personally laid a wreath at the tomb of the generals and soldiers who died in the European war. Tens of thousands of people cheered and paid tribute.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Is It True or False? Germany's Alarming Military Preparations <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Reportedly Discovered by French Spies</p>
<p>London, 12th (Havas) - French counterintelligence personnel discovered military activities in Germany and compiled a statistical table. A Paris-based reporter for the British "Sunday Express" witnessed this table and asserted that the German government, in the event of an emergency, could use force with the following steps: (1) The first step is that upon the issuance of a mobilization order, there will be 30 infantry divisions, 9 cavalry divisions, and a large number of available aircraft, totaling 550,000 men, ready for immediate combat; (2) The second step is that within 48 hours, 1.2 million men can be armed. These people have long served in the military and have received considerable technical training in new-style military equipment such as rifles, machine guns, and assault vehicles; (3) In the third step, there are 2 million reserves who, with some active training, can be transferred to the front line within the first week of the war.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Conflict Between Old and New Factions in Siam <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The New Faction Tries Hard to Suppress the Old Faction</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Are Also Excluded by the New Faction</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: A teacher who recently returned from Siam talked about the situation in Siam. He said that after the successful revolution in Siam in the autumn of 1931, the constitution was quickly completed, and a constitutional monarchy was implemented. The old royal family was treated favorably, and an agreement was made to preserve all royal family property. After more than a year of peace, the People's Party gained power and implemented a pro-Japan policy. The fact that the Siamese representative recently abstained from voting in Geneva, deliberately pleasing a powerful neighbor, is ironclad proof. After the New Party came to power, it adopted many unfavorable measures toward the overseas Chinese, such as restricting overseas Chinese education, increasing the entry tax and residence tax for Chinese. In November 1931, Siam established an entry tax for overseas Chinese, requiring each person to pay a residence tax of ten ticals upon entry, which would then be recorded on the residence permit. Those who had not resided in Siam for two years and returned to their home country for some reason and then traveled to Siam again would be treated as new arrivals. Those who had resided in Siam for more than two years would be exempt from the residence tax. Since the implementation of these harsh regulations, the overseas Chinese have suffered greatly. In January of the following year, Siam announced that it would increase the residence tax for Chinese to one hundred and ten ticals, equivalent to more than 160 silver dollars, starting on April 1. The purpose was to prevent Chinese from entering the country to make a living, and it was stipulated that those under the age of 20 who did not know common Chinese or Siamese would not be allowed to disembark. Those who knew Chinese and foreign languages but did not have parents to testify would also be denied entry. On the surface, this was advertised as a temporary policy to alleviate the economic depression, but it had a clear anti-Chinese significance, which most Chinese and Siamese knew. Also, yesterday, a certain merchant house in Shantou received a private telegram from a Siamese merchant reporting that infighting had broken out between the old royal family's troops and the People's Party's troops in the area of Dongshi Helà. The reasons for the infighting were very complex, but the main cause was the levying of property taxes. In the past, the royal family had conferred fiefdoms and lands to their relatives and nobles. The royal family accounted for almost 60% to 70% of the national property. If land and real estate taxes were levied, the royal family would suffer greatly. This is the biggest reason for the New Party's infighting. Moreover, after the New Party came to power, the power of the New Party's troops greatly expanded, while the power of the Old Royalist Party was less than 30% of what it had been. The two parties were therefore constantly at odds, which is another cause of the infighting. (March 3)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Reasons for the Fall of Jehol <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Mostly Due to湯玉麟</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Also Resigns to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping: Jehol was invaded by the Japanese army for only ten days, and Chengde fell. The loss of territory by our troops was unprecedented. There are several reasons for this:湯玉麟 ruled Jehol for several years, wantonly collecting taxes and exploiting the people. The people complained and could not bear it. The people's hearts were lost, and it was difficult to expect them to defend the territory together. Therefore, when the Japanese army invaded, not only did it not receive assistance from the people, but it was also often hindered from marching and defending against the enemy. This is one reason. The Jehol army lacked training, and its combat effectiveness was insufficient. In addition, it had been owed pay for more than a year, and the army's morale was low. Before the battle, Song and Zhang arrived in Jehol, and the three armies yearned for a full meal. However,湯玉麟 took the 300,000 yuan in military expenses from the central government and pocketed it all. The soldiers did not receive a single cent. It is only natural that when wealth is accumulated by one person, the people will be scattered. With deep resentment, they were unwilling to die for the country when encountering a strong enemy. This is the second reason. Everyone knew that the Jehol army was not enough to defend, but湯玉麟 regarded Jehol as a forbidden area and did not want guest troops to invade and divide his power. Zhang Xueliang repeatedly wanted to send troops into Jehol but was refused. When the situation was critical, he finally allowed a part to enter, but showed welcome and resistance to the commanding officers. Zhang initially planned to send Wan Fulin to replace the Jehol army leader, but was blocked by湯. After repeated consultations, Zhang Zuoxiang was finally appointed. Time was wasted, and the opportunity was lost. The troops were not properly deployed, and the Japanese army had already entered, responding in a panic. The third reason is that the troops defending Jehol were complex and lacked unified command. They each sought their own interests and did not cooperate with each other. The Japanese army took advantage of this and broke through the entire line. This is the fourth reason. In the Kailu area, the Jehol army's Cui Xingwu and the volunteer army's Feng Zhanhai and Liu Zhendong were stationed. The volunteer army was originally under the command of the Liao, Ji, and Heilongjiang Support Association organized by Zhu Qinglan. Cui also had a considerable relationship with Zhu. However, at the time of the outbreak of the Jehol War, Zhang Xueliang suddenly pointed out that Zhu's command was ineffective and transferred all the volunteer army to the military branch, forming the Northeast Jehol Association, and promoted Zhu to the position of chairman to handle rear supply matters. The volunteer army protested and telegraphed against it. At the same time, there was a proposal to reorganize Cui Xingwu's brigade into a division. Cui hoped to be promoted, but湯玉麟 unexpectedly gave the position to Meng Zhaotian. Cui was greatly disappointed when he heard the news, and his attitude changed abruptly. Later, when the Japanese army attacked Kailu, Cui and the volunteer army retreated without a fight. The Japanese army entered as if no one was there and directly attacked Chifeng. From Kailu to Chifeng, the distance was no less than a thousand miles. Sun Dianying's troops, who were scheduled to defend Chifeng, had just arrived and had not yet been deployed when the enemy suddenly arrived. They responded in a panic, but it was difficult to hold out for long. The Chaoyang garrison, led by Dong, was ineffective in commanding and provoked internal strife. When the enemy army approached, they collapsed without a fight, and the natural danger was lost. Wolves entered the house. All of these factors, such as the lack of popular support, were major causes of the defeat. The fifth reason is that the Japanese army used aircraft, armored vehicles, artillery, smoke bombs, and other powerful weapons to invade Jehol, while our garrison's equipment was far behind. Due to financial and time constraints, defensive equipment was almost non-existent. When the enemy attacked, our troops could only fight with flesh and blood. The gap in weapons was too great, the sacrifices were too great, and it was difficult to sustain the fight. This is the sixth reason. Zhang Xueliang bears full military responsibility, and his spirit and ability were insufficient. It is difficult to deny this. In this Jehol War, in addition to his directly subordinate Northeastern Army, there were the Jehol Army, the Volunteer Army, and the armies of Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, and 怉炳勛 and Shang Zhen. To command them, impartiality and trustworthiness were necessary. However, Zhang lacked thoroughness in the overall plan, and the distribution of salaries and equipment was unfair, resulting in the overall situation losing its mainstay and the dispatching being ineffective. This is the seventh reason. However, looking back now, it is only regretful.</p>
<p>Since Jehol had fallen, Zhang attributed all responsibility to Tang and requested that he be arrested and that Wan Fulin be appointed as the chairman of Jehol. However, there was much criticism of Zhang, and it was not possible to simply blame Tang. Seeing that the situation in Jehol was beyond saving, the central government focused its efforts on trying to remedy the situation. In addition to ordering the rapid advancement of the large army, the chairman of the military commission, who bore the heavy responsibility of military affairs, also presided over everything from the south of Jiangxi. Jiang arrived in Baoding from Shijiazhuang at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 9th) and met with Zhang in the car. Zhang blamed himself for the loss of Jehol and proposed several plans for resisting Japan and his own advancement or retreat. Regarding his own problems, first, he was willing to lead his troops as the vanguard to recover the lost territory and redeem his previous mistakes, but the central government needed to provide sufficient supplies and equipment. Second, Zhang was guilty and resigned. The central government approved his resignation that day, retreating to the position of a virtuous person, and expressed that his personal situation was very difficult, unable to suppress his sigh. As a result of the consultation, the second method was adopted, allowing him to resign from his current and concurrent positions, handing over his duties and leaving Beiping that day. The central government temporarily dispatched He Yingqin to sit in charge. Jiang was stationed in Shi to preside over the overall plan and would go to Ping at any time when necessary to discuss matters. After the agreement was reached, Jiang returned to Shijiazhuang and waited for Yange to meet. Zhang then returned to Beiping early yesterday morning (the 10th) to rush to hand over his duties. He Yingqin also arrived with Xu Tingyao. After Zhang returned to Ping, he ordered his subordinates to handle the end and convened a meeting of military and political leaders to discuss the aftermath. Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, and others were summoned. That night, a meeting was convened at the Prince Shuncheng Mansion. Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Rong Zhen, Liu Zhe, and Zhang's confidants Zhu Guangmu, Zhou Dawen, and Hu Ruoyu all attended. Zhang first reported the experience of meeting with Jiang and the suffering of deciding to resign and leave Ping. The attendees expressed their intention to persuade him to stay. Zhang said that he had long had the intention of retiring, but he still hoped to do his best to contribute to the country, but now he had no choice but to retreat to avoid the position of a virtuous person. The central government had an overall plan and hoped that everyone would work hard for the country. The meeting lasted for seven or eight hours and did not end until around 4 a.m. this morning. He immediately issued a telegram to resign and prepared to leave Ping. After the meeting, Zhang rested slightly and then began to deploy his affairs to Shanghai. (　) (11th)</p>

<p>Jiang and Zhang Left Baoding Separately That Night</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: After Military Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Shijiazhuang from Hankou, he urgently wanted to meet with Zhang Xueliang to discuss the great plan to maintain North China, so he invited Zhang to a conference in Baoding the day before yesterday. The conference did not end until 10 p.m. According to sources, the details are as follows:</p>

<p>After Commission Chairman Jiang passed through Zhengzhou, he sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang, which mainly said that Zhang did not need to come a long way south because the defense of Beiping was important and he should stay in Ping to sit in charge. He himself would personally go to a location closer to Ping to meet and talk. After receiving the telegram, Zhang sent Pingjin Garrison Commander Wang Shuchang to travel south with He Yingqin and others. He arrived in Shijiazhuang on the evening of the 8th. Wang visited Jiang and asked for instructions, agreeing to meet in Baoding on the afternoon of the 9th. After receiving the telegram, Zhang set off from Xizhimen at 4 a.m. on the 9th with Tang Guozhen and Tan Hai, boarded a train at 4:50 a.m., passed through the Xiaochadao on the Zhangyi Gate, and took the Pinghan Line south, arriving in Baoding at noon.

<p>Commission Chairman Zhuang was originally scheduled to leave Shi on the late night of the 8th, but because he received a report from Song Ziwen, who had come north, he delayed his departure until 11 a.m. on the 9th by train. Song Ziwen arrived in Zhengzhou at 3 p.m. on the 8th and transferred to a express train for the Pinghan Line, arriving in Shijiazhuang at 10 a.m. on the 9th. Song immediately met with Jiang, He Yingqin, Huang Shao　, and others and ordered the Ford plane to stop at the airport outside the　of Baoding. Jiang　left Shi by train and arrived at Baoding Station at 4 p.m. without any delays along the way.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Situation During the Meeting <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>After Zhang arrived in Baoding, he immediately sent guards to strictly guard the area near the station. All welcoming personnel gathered on the East Platform and stood waiting. As the Chiang special train entered the station, Zhang boarded the train first and reported to Zhuang about the events in Jehol. After Chiang, Zhang, and Song talked, they invited He Yingqin, Yang Jie, Wang Shuchang, and others to talk individually, discussing the military issues in Huabei for a long time. Jiang made an overall plan for the military issues of the Japanese army's invasion of Jehol and the renewed invasion of Huabei. The central government and the local government decided to cooperate and dispatched Minister of Transport He Yingqin and Chief of Staff Yang Jie to stay in Ping for a long time to assist everything. Finally, Zhuang summoned Zhang to talk, and Zhang confessed that he was responsible for the loss of Jehol and expressed his intention to resign to Jiang in his telegram to the central government. Jiang told Zhang to return to Ping immediately.</p>

<p>The Longmei Tea Merchants' National Salvation Support Association in Saigon, Annam, Huang Rongfa, and others sent a letter to the China Aviation Association and remitted 1,000 taels of silver through the Bank of East Asia to donate for the purchase of aircraft. The original letter stated: "The tea merchants in Anshi, Annam, established the National Salvation Support Association immediately after the bad news from the Northeast was received. They have worked hard for national salvation through official channels and donations. During the Shanghai battle, they remitted 2,000 taels of silver to General Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army. Recently, we heard that you gentlemen are assisting in the righteous cause and establishing aviation for national salvation. We hereby remit 1,000 taels of silver postal notes to the Bank of East Asia for your receipt to contribute our humble efforts. Hereafter, we will reduce our food and save every penny to work hard to sign up for donations and remit the total amount whenever it is collected. We are determined to save the country and destroy the Japanese slaves. Written without eloquence, we respectfully submit this letter. Huang Ronghou of the Longmei Tea Merchants' National Salvation Support Association in Saigon, Annam, respectfully bows."</p>
<p>Dong Shiyou's Enthusiasm</p>
<p>Dong Shiyou, an engineer from the Inland Water Company, has always been extremely enthusiastic about national affairs. During this China Aviation Association's recruitment of members, Dong Shiyou readily agreed, introduced by Section Chief Song of the Public Works Bureau. Dong Shiyou's wife, Zhang Jian'e, and their six-month-old son joined as special members. He also persuaded his father, Dong Xinghui, to join as a sponsoring member, and his younger brothers Dong Shizuo (special member), Shili, Shishe, Shiqi, Shixi, and Shiwei (ordinary members) all joined. The entire family joined, which can be said to be enthusiastic and patriotic. In addition, Hong Shun Heji Timber Company donated 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Hong Shun Association Support</p>
<p>Since the promotion of the aviation for national salvation movement in various circles of this city, remarkable achievements have been made. All members of the Hong Shun Mutual Aid Association are enthusiastically involved in this movement. In addition to the association already joining the Shanghai General Team No. 267 Branch of the China Aviation Association Recruitment Team as a member, the other executive committee members and members are enthusiastically joining the team as special members and ordinary members. It is said that there was a misunderstanding in the past, but the Dalai Lama has now realized it. He recently sent a letter to the Panchen Lama to explain and restore the old friendship. Therefore, the Panchen Lama sent three representatives to Tibet to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. The war between Tibet and Kham has now ceased for many days. The Dalai Lama has repeatedly expressed his desire for peace, and the central government wishes to resolve the issue through political means.</p>
<p>Panchen Lama to Qinghai</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also said that he himself will soon go to Qinghai (Zhu is from Qinghai Province). The Panchen Lama will also travel to Qinghai in the near future because the Mongolian and Tibetan people of Qinghai Province are devout Buddhists and earnestly hope for the visit of the Panchen Lama.</p>
<p>Jueyuan Preaching</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Chinese Buddhist Association and the Buddhist Pure Karma Society jointly hosted a banquet to welcome the Anqin Living Buddha and respectfully requested him to preach. Wang Yiting, Wang Hanzhi, Qu Zhiliu, Guan Gangzhi, Li Yunshu, Wen Lanting, and others offered incense and invited the Anqin Living Buddha to ascend the seat. His dignified demeanor commanded respect. He gave a lecture in Tibetan, which was translated by an attendant. Qu Wenliu then explained to the public that he was very pleased to see the prosperity of Buddhism in various places in the mainland. Sakyamuni appeared in the world for a major cause, which was to make people develop Bodhi-mind and treat all sentient beings as their own parents. He then described the situation of Tibetan Buddhism and the major sects of the Exoteric and Esoteric schools. The listeners were all delighted and believed in it.</p>
<p>Transferring from Hong Kong to India</p>
<p>Zhu Fu Nan, Deputy Director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Beijing, came to Shanghai to see off the three representatives, Anqin, and to take care of all travel procedures. Anqin and the other two representatives, along with 18 attendants and servants, boarded the Italian ship Contravate last night and set sail south this morning. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, they will transfer to a ship to Kolkata (northeast coast of India), disembark, and take a train to the Tibetan border at Yuelongtou Mountain to enter Tibet. The journey will take about 50 days. After arriving in Tibet, they will pray at various monasteries and return east around September to report back.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Prepares to Go Abroad</p>
<p>Refuses Banquets in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yu Fengzhi Arrives Today</p>
<p>Reception for the Press Today. Zhang Xueliang arrived in Shanghai from Peiping at 3:00 PM today and is staying at No. 181 Julaida Road. Yesterday morning, he refused to meet guests and rested at his residence. His wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, left Tianjin by train the night before last and will arrive in Shanghai today. Zhang is currently expediting the procedures for going to Europe and will go to France within a month. Various news items are listed below:</p>
<p>Resting Briefly. Zhang resigned from his military post and came to Shanghai to rest briefly before traveling abroad. His close friends, such as Vice President Song of the Executive Yuan, Shanghai Mayor Wu Daicheng, and Mr. Du Yuesheng, originally planned to host a banquet for Zhang yesterday. However, Zhang declined due to exhaustion and because he felt unwell after taking a plane the day before. Therefore, Mayor Wu's banquet and the Bankers Association's banquet, which were originally scheduled to coincide with Zhang's arrival at Hongqiao Airport, and Mr. Du Yuesheng's planned reception, have been postponed.</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters. Vice President Song sent a letter to Zhang yesterday morning, the content of which is unknown. Zhang's reception for local newspaper reporters is scheduled for 3:00 PM today at No. 501 West Aihamus Road, the residence of the Song family, where Zhang will pour out his pent-up feelings.</p>
<p>Ms. Yu's Arrival in Shanghai. Ms. Yu Fengzhi left Tianjin the night before last with more than 40 guards and took the Jinpu train south. She is expected to arrive in Beijing last night and transfer to the Jinghu train to Shanghai. She is expected to arrive in the city today.</p>
<p>Departure for France Within a Month. According to a close aide of Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang is determined to travel abroad, and his passport is currently being expedited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He will leave Shanghai for Europe within a month at the latest and will first go to France before traveling to various countries in Europe and America for observation. It is heard that he will stay in Shanghai for no more than two weeks, meaning that Mr. Zhang will have to leave Shanghai in less than a month.</p>
<p>Mr. Bao Continues to Arrive. Mr. Bao Wen, Mr. Zhang's representative, also arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing yesterday morning and immediately went to visit Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p>Exhuming the Remains of Fallen Loyalists</p>
<p>To Facilitate Burial in the Capital. Last year, the 87th Division of the Army fought bravely against the Japanese in the Miaohang and Zhouhang areas of Zhabei. At that time, a portion of the officers and soldiers who died in battle were buried by the soldiers of the division themselves. Yesterday, officers Long Buyun and Fan Xiangyan were specially dispatched to lead a total of 21 soldiers to the battlefield to exhume the remains. The remains of Wang Xiemin, a serviceman from the 57th Regiment, and soldiers Chen Jiashan, Yu Youjin, Xu Pengcheng, and others have been exhumed and placed in coffins. Around 4:00 PM, they went to Jiading Zhujing Bridge and other places to exhume the remains. It is heard that once the search and exhumation are completed, they will be sent to the capital for separate burial or sent back to their hometowns to comfort the loyal souls.</p>
<p>The Peiping Friendship Association Cables to Inform of Needed Supplies at the Front</p>
<p>Expresses Gratitude to the Shanghai Public Group for Comfort. Various groups, including the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Lawyers Association, received a cable from the Peiping Friendship Association, which read: "The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Education Association, Farmers Association, and Lawyers Association are all acknowledged.

<p>The grand event is now underway, and the military situation at the front is relatively tense. However, all important checkpoints have not been lost, and the soldiers are fighting bravely against the enemy with all their might. We request continued supplies, the most important of which are rain-resistant cotton socks, shirts and trousers, and hemp bags. We respectfully report this matter and express our gratitude. The Peiping Friendship Association respectfully bows."</p>

<p>Dropsy Is Not an Incurable Disease</p>
<p>Zhuangan Wuaidan's Great Success. The National Medical Community Is Amazed.</p>
<p>Dropsy, a disease considered incurable by the Chinese medical community, and for which Western medicine has no effective cure, can only be treated by cutting open with a knife and needle. However, it will soon swell again, so it is difficult to cure one out of ten patients. Since the invention of Zhuangan Wuaidan by the Shanghai Zhengwei Pharmacy (West Heng Street, next to Wing On Company on Nanjing Road), many people have been saved for more than ten years. This medicine is effective for various symptoms such as water retention, bloating, abdominal distension, qi deficiency, fullness, female blood dropsy, infantile malnutrition, and food accumulation. Therefore, the national medical community considers it a groundbreaking and miraculous medicine, and they are happy to introduce it. This medicine is both effective and fast. Those with mild conditions can be cured by taking half a dose, and those with severe conditions will definitely be cured by one dose. A detailed instruction manual is available. Please send two cents for postage. The price is 20 yuan per dose, 10 yuan per half dose, and 5 yuan per box. No additional postage is charged for mail orders from other cities. Original team replies."</p>
<p>Zhang Haitian's Representative Talks About the Anti-Japanese Struggle</p>
<p>Where Did the Little White Dragon Go? Yang Zhaotang, Advisor to the Second Army and Commander of the Third Brigade of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, and Duan Shaobo, Chief of Staff of the Third Brigade and Former Commander of the Pre-Police Force, came to Shanghai to seek assistance. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency met them at their residence. According to them, Zhang Haitian, commander of the Third Brigade, also known as "Old North Wind," has more than 10,000 troops defending against the enemy outside [omitted text] and awaiting assistance. They have requested assistance from the military authorities, who have referred them to the anti-Japanese organizations in Peiping. However, the anti-Japanese organizations have not been able to provide immediate assistance. The troops at the front are in urgent need of provisions and ammunition, and Commander Zhang Haitian is also ill in Peiping. The front line is currently commanded by Yang Wenlong, the political director of the brigade. We have come to Shanghai overnight to seek assistance. Since the beginning of the war, our army has been deeply grateful for the financial assistance from compatriots in the rear. However, since we have never sent anyone to Guannei (inside the Great Wall) to make contact, the actual amount received by our army is only 1,800 yuan. This has probably been embezzled by unscrupulous handlers, which is heartbreaking to say. After sending representatives to Guannei, we actually received 6,000 yuan from Peiping and 5,000 yuan from Shanghai. This is still a reward and not enough to replenish the military supplies. Even if it is used to replenish military supplies, it is not enough for each person to receive one yuan, so how can it be of any help? Moreover, our army still has more than 10,000 well-equipped volunteer soldiers in the Liaonan area. If there is sufficient assistance, they can purchase guns and ammunition from [omitted text]. Large bullets cost two yuan per bullet, and small bullets cost five yuan per bullet, and most of them are sold by the Japanese. In addition, there are Deng Tiemei, Liu Jingyuan, and other troops. If there are funds to call upon them, hundreds of thousands of volunteer soldiers can immediately rise up. The reason why they have not been able to continue the anti-Japanese war is also because the personnel management and actions of the Peiping National Salvation Organization have not been perfect, resulting in uneven rewards and punishments, causing these volunteer soldiers to retreat due to exhaustion. Moreover, our army had a small-scale arsenal in [omitted text], which has now been shut down due to lack of funds." The reporter then inquired about the whereabouts of the Little White Dragon, who was once famous for fighting against Japan. According to them, he and Gai Sanxing fraudulently surrendered to the Japanese army, obtained 400,000 yuan in military expenses, replenished 400 to 500 guns, and tens of thousands of bullets, and then fiercely attacked the Japanese army, causing countless casualties. Later, he led more than 1,000 troops to join Ma Zhanshan's army. However, soon after, the Little White Dragon and Gai Sanxing left the army and disappeared. It is speculated that they have gone into hiding."</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen Have Left Moscow for Geneva</p>
<p>Then Return Home, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of Next Month. Yesterday morning, Mr. Wu Huanzhang, the representative of Ma Zhanshan in Shanghai, told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that he had just received a telegram from Chairman Ma (Zhanshan) stating that their passport procedures had been completed and that they had left Moscow for France and then to Geneva, Switzerland, before returning home. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of next month. The strength of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army still exists, and they will definitely have a way to repay the country.</p>
<p>Huang Naishu Talks About Postal Service After the Fall of Rehe Province</p>
<p>Although Revenue Is Small, Postal Services Have Been Affected</p>
<p>The Increase in Postage in Southeast Asia Can Be Implemented in the Short Term. After the Japanese army invaded Chengde, the entire province of Rehe fell into the hands of the violent Japanese.</p>
<p>This Frostbite Remedy</p>
<p>Unbroken Frostbite Swells on the Same Day</p>
<p>Healed Decaying Frostbite in a Few Days</p>
<p>Frostbite is a disease in which stagnant blood coagulates. In the beginning, it is red, swollen, and painful, which is unbearable. After it breaks, it is full of pus and painful. This disease is especially common in winter, and there is a lack of good remedies in the world. Now, the Zhengwei Pharmacy (West Heng Street, next to Wing On Company on Nanjing Road) in this city has invented two kinds of remedies: (1) Zhenzhu Baiyu Ointment is used to treat broken frostbite, remove rot, generate new tissue, and achieve rapid healing. (2) Frostbite Ruyi Water is used to treat unbroken frostbite, stop pain immediately, and eliminate redness and swelling. The price is extremely low. Zhenzhu Baiyu Ointment is only sold for 40 cents a box, and Frostbite Ruyi Water is sold for 20 cents a bottle, and 2 yuan per dozen. Wholesale is especially cheap. Mail orders from other cities will be charged an additional 20 cents for postage."</p>
<p>The current situation of the provincial government is unknown. In order to understand the current situation of postal communication in Rehe Province and the steps to be taken by the postal authorities in the future, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Huang Naishu, Director-General of Posts.</p>
<p>The previous situation</p>
<p>According to Mr. Huang, the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that Rehe Province is now a military area, has ordered the Directorate General of Posts to order all postal administrations in the country to refuse to accept mail to the province. The postal affairs of the province are under the jurisdiction of the Hebei Postal District. The actual situation of the postal affairs of the province and the annual income have not yet been fully compiled. Although the province has a large area, the postal situation is the opposite. According to statistics, there are only two second-class post offices in Chengde and Chifeng, twelve third-class post offices in Chaoyang, Fengning, Longhua, Beipiao, Lingyuan, Pingquan, Xinglong, Weichang, Wudancheng, Linxi, Kailu, and Jingpeng, and some agencies. Therefore, the annual income is very small.</p>
<p>Current situation</p>
<p>The above-mentioned post offices are now forced to carry out their work due to enemy intimidation. Therefore, when Chengde and other places fell, the local postal workers fled in droves to Gubeikou. They were then bombed and chased by Japanese aircraft and scattered. In addition, it is not easy to communicate by telegram. Therefore, the Hebei District Postmaster Ke Deng has not yet reported the details of the postal situation in the province. In addition to ordering all postal districts to refuse to accept mail to the province, I have not been able to announce any further steps that can be taken in the future. It is a natural trend that the postal workers of the province have resolutely abandoned their posts and left the country out of patriotic sentiment, and there is no need for the ministry to order them to return.</p>
<p>Remedial measures</p>
<p>Although the postal revenue of Rehe Province is small, it is still several tens of thousands of yuan. The postal authorities, in view of the short-term postal revenue, urgently need to implement the original plan to increase postage rates in Southeast Asia. This is currently being actively promoted and is progressing smoothly. It can be implemented in the short term."</p>
<p>China's Banking Sector Ceases to Participate in the World Economic Conference</p>
<p>The Central Government May Send Overseas Personnel</p>
<p>To Attend Nearby to Save Expenses. The World Economic Conference has been scheduled to be held in early May. Although the date has not been set, the Chinese authorities previously intended to send Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Industry Minister Chen Gongbo to attend in person. At the same time, the Shanghai banking sector and the International Chamber of Commerce branches had planned to send personnel to attend. According to Mr. Lin Kanghou of the Bankers Association, due to the increasing urgency of national defense and the deepening of national crisis, the International Chamber of Commerce branches and the banking sector have decided to cease participation. At that time, the central government may designate nearby personnel abroad to attend in order to save costs and reduce procedures.</p>
<p>Postal Savings in the Three Northeastern Provinces Prepared for Reimbursement</p>
<p>Since the suspension of postal services in the three northeastern provinces in July of last year, the postal assets of the province, which are sufficient to offset the postal savings debt, have been detained by the puppet state, and there has been no solution. After reporters inquired yesterday, the person in charge of the Directorate General of Postal Remittances and Savings stated that the case has been pending for a long time, and the depositors have suffered greatly. In order to show compassion, the Ministry of Communications has approved the reimbursement of all postal savings in the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal districts, regardless of fixed or current savings. The reimbursement procedures have been established and will be announced in major ports in the near future so that the public can be informed.</p>

<p>Canadian Commercial Commissioner Changes North China Management Area</p>
<p>Moved from Dalian to Tianjin. The Social Bureau yesterday issued an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that Order No. 16310 from the Ministry of Industry was received, approving a consultation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that a note from the British Minister, stating that the Canadian Commercial Commissioner is now planning to move to Tianjin and expand the jurisdiction to include the provinces of North China, etc., for reference and to be forwarded to all relevant agencies to provide convenience to the commissioner in the performance of his duties and in the entry of items used by the commissioner's office or carried by the commissioner personally, according to the regulations. The commissioner was originally stationed in Dalian, and the jurisdiction was the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, which has been communicated to your ministry. Now, the British Minister has stated that the expansion of the jurisdiction to the provinces of North China is still feasible. In addition to the reply and distribution, you are also requested to refer to it and order your subordinate agencies to provide convenience according to the regulations. In view of the above, the order is hereby issued for your compliance.</p>
<p>Measures for Payment of Fees for Shops and Branches Joining the Chamber of Commerce. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Great China Match Company, stating: "Upon receipt of your letter requesting clarification on the payment of fees for general branches joining the Chamber of Commerce or trade association, etc., the charter of this association stipulates that the collection of membership fees for shop members is based on the reported capital amount and collected according to the level. There is no distinction between the general store and the branch. As mentioned in your letter, if the general store is located in Shanghai and has joined this association, other branches in various places must join the chamber of commerce in the location where they are located. The membership fee to be paid by the general store in Shanghai to this association should be calculated by apportioning the total capital amount according to the number of general branches and calculating a part of the capital amount. There is no reason to the contrary, but it should be limited to branches located in outer ports that do not belong to the area of this city. The Joint Executive Supervisory Committee of this association has resolved to pass the record accordingly. This is hereby replied for your information."</p>
<p>China Factory Inspection Association to Host Press Conference Today</p>
<p>To Report on the Obstruction of the Special Zone and Issue a Declaration. The preliminary implementation of factory inspection in this city has long been completed. As for the inspection of the special zone, although the municipal government has repeatedly negotiated, the concession authorities still have many obstructions, so it has not yet been carried out. The China Factory Inspection Association believes that the unreasonable obstruction of the special zone authorities is a matter of national sovereignty and the interests of the industrial sector itself. It has specifically decided to host a press conference for the news reporters of this city at 2:00 PM today at the Hu An Building on Jing An Temple Road to report on the process and issue a declaration. It is also scheduled to host various trade associations tomorrow and labor unions the day after to coordinate the implementation methods.</p>
<p>After the Resumption of Rice Transport, a Large Number of Rice Boats Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Lianyi Association Requests Supervision of Measurement</p>
<p>Implementation of Leveling Measurement Funnel Delayed. After the rice boat merchants resumed transport upon the advice of the Party and government agencies, more than 100 rice boats from various gangs have successively transported rice to Shanghai in the past two days. The Lianyi Association of rice merchants in Hunan, Shanghai, stated that the notice issued by the Party and government agencies stipulated that the measurement should be carried out by the measurement officials and that the Party and government agencies should send personnel to supervise the measurement at any time. Therefore, yesterday morning, they sent representatives such as Chen Zhiqiang to submit a petition to the Party and government agencies, requesting that personnel be sent to supervise the measurement and that the implementation be carried out as soon as possible. Jiang Huaiqin of the Municipal Party Department and Zhang Binghui of the Social Bureau received the petition. They agreed to discuss the matter of leveling measurement funnel and schedule the implementation after mutual consultation.</p>
<p>The Military Department Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Bid on the Base of the Arsenal</p>
<p>Estimated at 1,000 Mu, Worth 6 Million Yuan. After the Shanghai Arsenal in Gaochang Temple was ordered to close last year, it is learned that the military department decided that the factory site, which has now been closed, is very large and can be converted into value for expansion of military equipment. Therefore, Chen, a counselor from the Ordnance Department, has been sent to Shanghai to inspect and measure the site. It is heard that the factory base is about 1,000 mu, and the current value is 6,000 yuan per mu, with a total value of 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Returning Guests Talk About the Suffering in the Northeast</p>
<p>Already Experienced the Taste of Being a Slave of a Conquered Nation. According to those who returned from Yingkou yesterday, the Japanese in Yingkou are very strict in their restrictions on the Chinese people after the fall of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe. Business is unusually sluggish. After nightfall every day, Chinese people are forbidden to (1) leave their homes, (2) read newspapers, (3) send telegrams, (4) make phone calls, (5) listen to the radio. Those who disobey will be severely punished once discovered. Residents are suffering from various oppressions, and complaints are everywhere. If people in the territory are allowed to go out, they must have three reliable shopkeepers fill out a form guaranteeing that they will return within the time limit, otherwise they will not be allowed to leave the country or ask the guarantor for the person, and so on.</p>
<p>Puhui Pond Scheduled to Start Construction</p>
<p>A Dam Will Be Built First Tomorrow. The Puhui Pond in West Shanghai has been silted up for a long time. Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a 94-year-old elder, and others initiated the diversion and dredging to prevent black water from flowing in and to benefit navigation. This has long been approved by the municipal government. However, the funds are huge, and there is still a shortfall of more than 60,000 yuan in addition to the funds allocated by the Songhu Rehabilitation Association. As a result, it has been delayed. The section from Jiepai Bridge to Yixi to Longgui Temple is under the jurisdiction of Songjiang and Qingpu counties and has long been started to excavate. After repeated requests to the municipal government by the Dredging Committee and the Caojing Pusong Municipal Committee members Yang Xinzheng and Chen Yafu, etc., the municipal government ordered the Public Works Bureau to recruit workers for bidding. The bidding was publicly opened the day before yesterday and contracted in sections. This has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Public Works Bureau has scheduled to build a dam at Tianluan Bridge and Longxin Bridge in West Shanghai tomorrow (15th) to carry out water pumping work for about a week before starting to dig mud. The entire river is divided into six sections, with a river surface width of six zhang, a river bottom of two zhang, and a depth of eight chi. The project is expected to be completed by the end of next month.</p>
<p>Italian Ship Libya Returns Home Tomorrow. The American Evening Post reported that the Italian cruiser Libya, which has been stationed in the Far East for six years, has been ordered to return to its home country and will set sail from Shanghai on Wednesday (15th). As for the Far East Fleet, the Italian authorities have sent a sister ship, the Guadu, to replace it. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the end of April. According to the current Italian ships stationed in Shanghai, in addition to the cruiser Libya, there are also the gunboats Leipanto and Capodato. The Leipanto arrived in Shanghai from Italy just two days ago to join the Far East Fleet.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Association Asks to Prohibit the Use of Chemical Fertilizers. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association submitted a document to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Construction requesting a ban on fat field powder. For chemical fertilizers that harm the fields, please quickly investigate and ban them to prevent abuses and harm agricultural production. The bean cakes, vegetable cakes, sesame cakes, tung cakes, peanut cakes, etc. produced in our country are all excellent bulk fertilizers that have been used by farmers consistently. In recent years, foreign chemical fertilizers have been dumped in our country. Their ingredients mostly contain sulfuric acid. When applied to crops, they cannot provide the required nutrients evenly, and the residual acidity, when excessive, can harm the crops. Moreover, chemical substances that linger in the soil can harden the soil, making it difficult to cultivate, like a stone field. Fertilizer merchants, disregarding the harm, focus on private gain and take advantage of our farmers' lack of scientific knowledge. With no verification from the government, they collude to manipulate and adulterate, calling them "fat field powder." They promote them vigorously, taking advantage of the farmers' ignorance and selling them cheaply on credit. They have spread and sold them all over the country, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. According to a report from the Zhejiang Provincial Office, the amount of fat field powder imported annually is about 23 million yuan, and the trend is increasing. This shows that the sales are strong, and the existing domestic fertilizers are being suppressed and may not survive. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has strictly prohibited the import of the above-mentioned chemical fertilizers, which is indeed insightful. However, Jiangsu and Zhejiang are adjacent. Since Zhejiang Province has issued a strict ban, the chemical fertilizers that were previously sold in Zhejiang Province will inevitably turn to Jiangsu Province as the final destination. There is no end to the harm. It is imperative to request that the prefectural government promptly investigate and ban all kinds of chemical fertilizers that harm farmland and order all counties to instruct all villages to earnestly advise farmers not to purchase chemical fertilizers to prevent abuses and maintain agriculture. This would be a great benefit. Respectfully presented to Gu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, Chairman and Committee Member Gu Yi respectfully presents. (Presented to Dong Wensong, Director of the Department of Construction of Jiangsu Province)</p>
<p>The Three Ships of the 27th Squadron Returned to Shanghai. The three destroyers of the 27th Squadron of the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai, Dong, Ling, and others, were secretly dispatched by Commander Minei to various places along our coast last Monday to spy. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM, the three ships had already sailed back to Shanghai and docked at Pukou Yangshupu River. The captains of each ship went to the headquarters to report to Minei on the inspection.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Hires a Westerner as a Police Commissioner.</p>
<p>Secretary Guo Recovers from Illness and Returns to His Post. The Municipal Government has hired a Westerner, Mr. Walls, as a police commissioner. He has now taken office. Secretary Guo, who previously resigned due to illness, has recently recovered his health. Mayor Wu ordered him to return to his post, and Mr. Guo has arrived at the government office.</p>
<p>More Than 100 Disaster Victims in Zhabei Petition Wang Binyan Again. Since the Municipal War Zone Rehabilitation Committee stipulated last year that each household of disaster victims in Zhabei would be allocated 150 yuan for building houses, the funds would be issued in three installments to avoid waste. Some have already received the first and second installments, while others have not received a single cent. The delay has lasted for more than a year. Although the Disaster Victims Association has repeatedly petitioned, no progress has been made. A meeting was held again the day before yesterday to discuss the issue. Upon hearing the news, the disaster victims flocked to the association to demand a solution. Because the association could not agree, it was decided to petition charitable organizations again the next day. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the association sent representatives such as Shen Wenbin to visit Mr. Wang Binyan, and more than 100 disaster victims automatically took their children and elders to seek help, stating that they could not maintain their lives. Mr. Wang received them and transferred the request to the Rehabilitation Committee to expedite the allocation of 30,000 yuan from the previous meeting's charitable funds to enable them to settle down as soon as possible (each villager has their own foundation). Mr. Wang replied that the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee has not met for a long time, and the group has submitted a request to hold a meeting as soon as possible to resolve the points requested by your association, which will be submitted for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>Xu Shiying Writes to the Minister of Railways Requesting Free Transportation of Disaster Relief Rice</p>
<p>Referring to the Precedent of the Northeast Disaster Relief Association. The United Association of Charitable Organizations in Shanghai for Disaster Relief to Northeastern Refugees, Xu Shiying, purchased disaster relief rice in Suiyuan Datong and plans to request the Ministry of Railways to refer to the precedent of the Shanghai Northeastern Refugee Relief Association for free transportation. The original letter is recorded below: Mr. Meng Yu, Minister, Xun Jian, I have been away from your teachings for many days, and I am sending you my blessings and congratulations on your successful administration in Suiyuan. The most critical aspect of disaster relief in the Northeast is the lack of food. We have sent personnel to Suiyuan and Datong to purchase millet for distribution. However, the cost of transportation is quite high. I have long admired your compassion and enthusiasm for charitable undertakings. We have requested that you refer to the precedent of the Shanghai Northeastern Refugee Relief Association for free transportation in order to save disaster relief funds. We also request that you order the Ping-Sui and Bei-Ning Railway Bureaus to expedite and facilitate the transportation of disaster relief supplies by our association to facilitate disaster relief. I respectfully request your approval and look forward to your reply.

<p>The End of the Road for Volunteer Troops   Shiheng</p>
<p>Ever since President Song and Young Marshal Zhang inspected the front lines in Rehe, the three armies, instead of rallying, lost Chengde within ten days, ceding all of Rehe's territory to the Great Japanese Empire. According to a Shanghai-based English newspaper, the first to enter Chengde City were only 128 Japanese soldiers, an unheard-of event. Perhaps the reporter for this English newspaper hasn't been in China long and has little experience. In fact, there are many strange things in China, and this little matter is not worth being surprised about. If another country could be like China, willing to offer one of its cities with both hands, even a single Japanese soldier holding a Japanese flag could walk into Paris and London. The reason for the loss of Rehe this time is said to be due to Chairman Tang's hasty retreat and the volunteer troops' retreat without a fight. As a result, Young Marshal Zhang requested the government to investigate Tang Yulin and issued an order strictly prohibiting the volunteer troops from entering the Pass, threatening to shoot those who do. The reason given is that these detestable volunteer troops usually ask the government for money and weapons, but retreat in the face of battle, deserving death ten thousand times over. The order stated that they must guard the Great Wall and prevent these volunteer troops from running into the Pass to cause trouble. It is pitiful for these volunteer troops, but also admirable. In any case, they have expressed themselves and their nation. Since the Three Eastern Provinces were occupied by the Japanese, we have only heard the term "volunteer troops" being the most active. At the beginning of the Rehe War, the same volunteer troops were still struggling. They endured cold and hunger, hoping for the rescue of our government's army. Now that Manchuria is unified, they are not allowed to enter the Pass, nor are they allowed to return home. Their only path is to fight to the death. Perhaps they will not even need to fight, as starvation can end their lives. Now, surrounded by guns and cannons, the volunteer troops are caught between the two sides. When will both sides eliminate these volunteer troops, so that there will be no more war outside the Pass, and our old nation can be temporarily at peace? Quickly kill off these volunteer troops; what use are they? These are the fuses. But great are these volunteer troops, because they have expressed themselves and, at the same time, expressed the clay of our nation.   Cao Juren   From "A Short Stay in Suzhou Diary"</p>
<p>The Next Day After Shirakawa Was Bombed</p>
<p>The atmosphere was very tense. I went to Suzhou with trepidation. Although it is said to be paradise, I have never felt longing for it. Inland river ships detour from Songjiang to Suzhou, a temporary measure during wartime. Every dock is very unfamiliar to me. The river channel is narrow and winding. As the small boat passes, white waves roll and crash onto both banks, with water splashing directly onto the shore. At noon, the small boat sailed into an exceptionally winding river channel, with thirty to fifty families on both banks, a small town. People on the boat said that it was Luxun Sandang. After passing the small town, there were many brick kilns along the way, on a very large scale. At one place, dozens of chimneys stood tall. I was staring at the chimneys, lost in thought, when suddenly, three to five women and children on the right bank came running along the shore, shouting wildly and bending down to pick up mud clods from the roadside, throwing them directly at the small boat. At first, I thought it was playful teasing and didn't take it seriously. However, the small boat had only moved ten or so yards when another group of women and children came chasing after us, and even farmers of the year used hoes to dig up mud and throw it at the small boat one after another. Only then did I realize that this was a malicious act. Their wild shouts were curses to the small boat. The boatman hid inside the boat, silent. The mud clods hit the boat with a soft thud, turning into fine sand, not even damaging a piece of glass on the windows. This tribulation lasted about one or two hours. I stood at the bow of the boat, quietly watching them so breathless and strained, watching the mud clods fly away with a rustling sound, feeling very empty and lonely in my heart. I focused my gaze on the rolling white waves, watching them rush onto the shore, watching them peel off layers of mud from the riverbank. Sometimes, the white waves rushed into the crudely built mud pits made by the farmers near the fields, collapsing the entire pit. Only then did I understand the reason for their curses and mud-slinging. But why didn't they throw stones? Subconsciously, I suddenly remembered the story of the Zhuji farmers burning Hangzhou ships ten years ago, and I also recalled the story of the Hangzhou rickshaw pullers destroying public buses. Will throwing mud clods every day end peacefully? I fear that one day, they will throw stones in the past. However, the Hangzhou ships still travel on the Qiantang River, and the public buses still rush straight on the streets of Hangzhou. Seeing the small boat chugging forward, the mud clods scattering with a soft thud, it is precisely its arrogance. It finally arrived safely in Suzhou. Every time friends come to Suzhou from Shanghai, I always inquire about this matter. They all say that they are still throwing mud clods, but no stones have been thrown yet. They will finally not throw stones, won't they?</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Significance of Moving Antiquities   Li Huiying <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Although moving antiquities has faced many difficulties, a large portion has finally been moved from Beiping to Nanjing via Pukou, and recently stored at the former site of Renji Hospital in Shanghai. Relying on the foreign aura of the foreign powers, it is likely that the Japanese imperialist artillery fire will not risk hitting the antiquities. The government's responsibility to protect antiquities can be considered temporarily completed to a small extent. Ultimately, why must these antiquities be moved from the ancient city to the foreign settlement? It is said that the government's removal of antiquities is, of course, partly because they are valuable, but also because antiquities are closely related to Chinese culture, so Beiping can be lost, the country can be destroyed, but culture cannot be lost. Therefore, antiquities must be moved; such is the meaning. After all, because antiquities are so closely related to Chinese culture, we must keep them safe. Therefore, the Three Eastern Provinces can be given to the Japanese without preparation; this is not a big deal, as there are no antiquities there, so the cultural significance is minimal. Therefore, Rehe can be given to the Japanese with preparation. No matter how much the people clamor, it still doesn't matter, as there are antiquities. Moreover, Rehe is not wealthy; what is the pity of losing it? All of this is not important; what is important is that the Japanese are about to attack Beiping, which is no small matter. How can cultural relics be allowed to be destroyed by the enemy? Therefore, the Three Eastern Provinces can be left unreclaimed, and Rehe can be offered up, but antiquities must be moved. From this, we can see that antiquities are more important than territory by countless trillions of times. From this, we can know that even if all of China is occupied by foreign devils, it doesn't matter; even if the country is destroyed, culture remains. What does it matter? As for the people of the Three Eastern Provinces and Rehe, since they are not related to culture, are not valuable, and are not as easy to move as antiquities, then let them be, let them live or die, let them be slaves to the Japanese; that is not important at all. Furthermore, antiquities can always be auctioned off in the future, unlike the Three Eastern Provinces, Rehe, and the local people, from which no value can be derived after being sold off. From this, we can know that antiquities are more important than national territory and more important than the countless millions of people who cannot be moved. Therefore, antiquities must be moved; this is the significance of moving antiquities.</p>
<p>Parisian Tidbits   Xiao Shijun, Sent from Paris</p>
<p>(II) Fauvism and National Crisis. The French contemporary Fauvist painter, Vlaminck, has already been introduced in the country, which is a very gratifying thing (however, the extent to which the introducer understands Vlaminck is questionable). Vlaminck is a person with keen senses, intense emotions, clear intellect, and strong will. He can truly represent the characteristics of the Gallic nation. A true artist is originally the son of the nation. The passionate emotions and clear intellect of the French are generally seen. As for their indomitable will, before the European War, there were still a few people who did not quite believe it. People who pass by Paris fleetingly always think that the character of the French is close to fragile, or even say that they are close to licentious. This is not surprising, as Paris is originally a place of gold and extravagance. If you crave pleasure, I dare say that Paris is an earthly paradise. However, this paradise of theirs is irrigated with the blood of countless benevolent people and patriots. For example, when this very famous Fauvist painter, Vlaminck, heard about the outbreak of the European War, he was living in Bonaparte Street in Paris. After receiving the mobilization order to go to war, he immediately put down his paintbrush and spent several years of hellish life on the battlefield. Later, he said that he had tasted the bitterness of life and witnessed the tragedy of people killing people with his own eyes, and sometimes he had to pick up a gun to stab the enemy himself. He did not paint a single painting during the war, but he still did not forget his vocation. He wrote in his wartime diary: "This war will probably have no end, and I will never have the opportunity to paint again." However, the storm will eventually end. After the armistice, he picked up his paintbrush again. His friends all said that the war was of great significance to him because he had grasped the eternal truth of the soul during this period. He has made many contributions to France's national crisis, and the national crisis has also given him a lot of training. His most famous work, La Grande Odalisque, seems cold as ice at first glance, but the woman's waist and abdomen in this painting possess the solid beauty of the earth. He not only pays attention to content; he believes that in a masterpiece, content and form should be integrated. What he values most is the method of painting (Methode). When he traveled to Italy, he discovered a perfect world of painting. Like Ingres (1780-1867), he admires Raphael the most among the three great writers of the Renaissance. Perhaps some people will question why he does not admire Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo, but prefers Raphael. According to critics, Vlaminck, who has a strong will, may not be very satisfied with Raphael's fragile way of dealing with things. The reason why he admires Raphael is mostly because he focuses on the artistic method. We know that the value judgment of art can produce various differences from various perspectives. For example, for a work, some people judge it from the path of artistic development, and some people judge it from pure artistic theory. People who judge from the path of artistic development also either focus solely on the originality in the work or focus on whether the originality in the work has reached a state of completion. As for those who judge from pure artistic theory, some emphasize content, and some emphasize form. Therefore, the judgments made by critics throughout history on the three great writers of the Renaissance are extremely inconsistent. The admiration of Raphael by Ingres and Vlaminck cannot be considered a rare exception. Let's take another example. When the great German poet Goethe first stayed in Rome, he considered Michelangelo to be the greatest writer of the Renaissance. Michelangelo's strengths are by no means comparable to Raphael's. However, after a year, when he went to Rome again, he discovered that Raphael was stronger than anyone as a painter. The judgment before and after was like two different people, which was due to a great change in Goethe himself. The Goethe who first stayed in Rome belonged to the romantic period, and the Goethe who stayed in Rome for the second time belonged to the classical period. Ingres, needless to say, is a classical artist. Now, some people call Vlaminck a giant of the neoclassical school. These empty names have nothing to do with a true artist. A critic put it well: "True art has the right to retrace tradition after a revolution." Because what art itself requires is only inherent truth. We can never say that Vlaminck's admiration for Raphael is an imitation of Ingres; similarly, we can never say that Ingres and Vlaminck are imitations of Raphael, because imitation is by no means art. They are only similar in method. The so-called similarity is by no means identical, just as the similar points in mathematics are definitely not the same point.</p>
<p>The Black Girl Seeks God (27)   By George Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"Then," said the Arab, sadly, "in a place where men talk of women I shall not find God." "Nor," said the black girl, turning to go, "in a place where women talk of men." The image maker waved his hand as if agreeing, and went away. Nothing especial happened until she came to the villa, so small, so exquisitely turreted, with a garden so reverently weeded, that she felt the venerable gentleman toiling among the flowers must be full of a delicate mystery. His eyes seemed to glow all over his face. His nose was so acute that he seemed all nose. His mouth was so quaintly sardonic that he seemed all mouth. She had to bring these irreconcilable impressions into one feeling, which she succeeded in doing by deciding that he was all brains. "I beg your pardon, sir," she said: "may I speak to you?" "How do you do, young woman?" said the old gentleman. "I want to ask my way to God," she said. "You have the wisest face I have ever seen; so I thought I would ask you." "Come in," he said. "I have come to the conclusion, after many trippings and tumblings, that the best place to look for God is the garden. You can seek him there." "That is not my notion of seeking God," said the black girl, disappointed. "I must go on and thank you." "Does your own notion guide you to him?" said he. "No," said the black girl, stopping; "I dare not say it does. But I don't like your notion. Many people who have found God have not liked him, and have fled from him and spent the rest of their lives trying to hide from him. Why do you think you would like him?" "I cannot say why," said the black girl, save that the preacher had a rhyme that we should love him at the first view.”</p>

Market sentiment was very stable, and the opening price jumped to 713.5 taels. Initially, the foreign exchange market was tight except for Sterling. As the market tightened, HSBC quoted Sterling unchanged and the US dollar rose by 2.5 yuan. However, this price did not attract much activity. Although trading volume was low after the market was split, banks quoted 32.75 yuan for June US dollars and then raised prices to 8.5 yuan. After that, banks' appetites varied, with prices fluctuating. Spot gold prices also fluctuated. After a long period of trading, the foreign exchange market remained tight. HSBC and other banks offered June US dollars at 75, but there were no strong buyers. As a result, the market stagnated slightly and then fell sharply to 10.03 yuan.

Overall, the market was very flat, and banks showed strong appetite. Hedging was very active, and swap points narrowed. Short positions were unable to sustain themselves. American banks have resumed operations on a fixed-term basis, and silver prices are unlikely to favor short positions. However, the increase was not significant, and interest among traders was not strong. Spot prices fell due to higher futures prices, resulting in a gap of 24 taels. Swap points for March and April ranged from 14.5 taels to 16 taels. The market situation for the day is recorded below. In the morning, the initial offer was 0.067 taels, but there were few transactions.

Citibank sold June US dollars at 75, and the price fell to 4.5 taels. Hengyu bought, and the price rose to 5.7 yuan. Jialidi also sold June 75, and it gradually retreated to 2.5 taels, because the arbitrage force was strong. Dadecheng Zhifengyong bought and then held June US dollars at 75 and rose to 4 taels.</p>
<p>Items used for arbitrage arbitrage were still for sale and were sold to 3 taels. Hua Bi bought June 75, and it rose even more to 5.5 taels. Qian Changxiang sold the goods but made a strong struggle so that it was stationed at 5 taels for a long time, although it has seen fall to 2 taels, but because the banks have a very good appetite, Mitsui Anda has consecutively accepted June 75, and Fuyu, etc., have progressed to 7 taels. Tianfengyong sold the goods and stopped selling. HSBC closed June 75, forming a downward trend. Yuanmao Yong came to sell a slip and the people in the market were in a trance, descending to 3 taels. Yihui Yong sold out strongly, and for a time, the selling wind was very strong. Items were also sold, so that they fell to 1 tael, for a total of 10.03 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange market was still not loosened, Shengda bought the goods at a low price and pulled it to 2 taels, but there was still a fallback, and the gold market also rose to 4 taels. Zhongfu ate the May U.S. dollar for $2.25 and Qian Changxiang came to buy it. Scattered households raised prices and were good until 6 taels and a half. After entering the market, transactions were flat, sometimes rising and sometimes falling at 5 taels. The afternoon's closing price was 715.7 taels. The items are sold for 5.8 taels.</p>

So he advanced the futures in the same industry, and the price rose to 9 taels. Although Hengyu Zhifeng Yong slightly sold, it was still reduced to 8 taels and 6 cents. Mitsui bought June U.S. dollars at 25 and Qian Changxiang came to buy it. Wanxing also bought and went out of 20 taels. McGalliard made a deal with June U.S. dollars at 1.25 yuan, and Yifeng Yong continued to buy it, and the price rose to 20.05 taels. At this point, the foreign exchange market was slightly firm, and the banks were eager to close the market. Dadecheng broke up and sold at 20 taels, falling to the vicinity of 9 taels. The June U.S. dollars were not easy to sell for 25 yuan, and Bingxing went up on the market to sell a strip, falling by more than 2 taels to the vicinity of 7 taels. Sumitomo accepted the June U.S. dollars for $2.25, and the gold price no longer fell, hovering between 1 tael or so. After entering the market, Bingxing suddenly came to cover up and gradually rose, and Daxing Yong came to buy, and McGalliard bought it at 25 and rose to 9 taels and 3 cents. McGalliard issued May U.S. dollars at 31.75 yuan, and it was reduced to 7 taels and 6 cents. The tendency of trading again emerged. The Central Bank ate the June U.S. dollars for 4.43 yuan (silver map), which was gradually increased from Zhongnan to the vicinity of 20 taels, and people's hearts were very stable. Although Yifeng Yong accepted a small number of buyers, the enemy households all rose to 20 taels to 1 tael, but because there were few transactions, the trend was slow. Fuyu Tianfeng Yong also accepted 2 taels, and Bingxing Chunyuan Yong also bought, and they gathered at 2 taels. However, because the foreign exchange market was silent, Hengyu Hongli saw high and sold, falling by 1 tael. The final closing price was 700 taels and 18 points. After the market closed, Hongli and others still came to sell, so the items are slightly sold out for 1 tael. The items are checked. The highest price of the day was 700 taels and 28 points, and the lowest price was 710.03 taels. There was a difference of 12 taels and a half, and the results continued to rise 18.3 taels more than on Saturday. HSBC officially announced that the U.S. dollar had risen by 2.5 yuan to 31.25 yuan, which is consistent with the gold price of 768 taels.

In summary, Qian Changxiang, Yuanheng, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, Daxingyong, Bingxing, Fuyu, Yifengyong, and others all advanced, while Dada, Decheng, Shengda, Yuanmaoyong, Hongli, Hengyu, Tianfengyong, etc. sold. About 100 more items were traded. By the end of last Saturday, the total number of items traded in April was 22,057. The fall in spot prices was due to the increase in futures prices, so that sellers slightly increased activity. The spot price was 24 taels higher than the spot price. Only Dada Decheng and Yingfenghang had slightly larger trading volumes, but the quantity was very small, only a few dozen taels, which gradually retreated to 2-3 taels. There were rumors of 14-15 taels in the outside market in the afternoon.</p>

The New York silver price shrank by half a point. Although the U.S. market opened calmly, it was stable and tight. After opening, banks were seeking to buy at 31.875 yuan. HSBC officially announced that the shilling was not moving, but the U.S. dollar had increased by 2.5 yuan. In comparison, it was still tight. Banks were eager to buy, and gold merchants were more eager to sell than to buy. Dalian merchants were still trending toward acceptance and were doing better and better. Although the gold market rose and fell in the morning, the U.S. dollar was still at 32.625 yuan or less in the foreign exchange market. The afternoon was even better, with a tightening trend. The June U.S. dollar once did to 32.125 yuan before seeing a relaxation, but it soon returned to its original view. At the close of the market, the spot rate for British currency was 1 shilling 8 pence 9375, and the U.S. dollar was 30.0625 yuan, which were tighter than the previous close, softening by 125 (shilling) and 1.5 yuan, respectively.

The market urgently made up for its position, and the market price rose sharply. The market speculators seemed to have put aside the intensity of the war and the urgency of the situation in Pingjin. In fact, the shorts had only one goal. The Japanese disturbances in Pingjin had not been realized so far. All parties were firmly stable as before. There were rumors in the market that peace was gradually being reached. Although they were unfounded, the shorts had gradually been shaken. A clear squeeze has taken place on the trading platform, further lifting the market's mood. The market price has risen steadily from morning to night.

<p>Japanese books also include those I’ve read, British books, French books, Japanese books, many indeed. Ah, does he understand so many languages? Someone leaned in to whisper. He not only understands foreign languages but also has great works. The history of literature he distributed to us as lecture notes in the first half of the year, according to him, had over two hundred thousand words. That was only two or three tenths of what survived the Japanese artillery fire during the January 28th Incident. Imagine how large the original work must have been. Listen, he’s lecturing. Truly, he's lecturing. Someone took the back pain of a person bent over washing clothes as a topic and wrote a tens of thousands of words essay. For example, taking the warmth of a fireplace as a topic can also produce over a hundred thousand words. But didn't he tell us how to write essays? Someone was doubting this, looking at their watch while rubbing their hands, saying, "Okay, class dismissed," and then hurried off. Can one feel at ease taking this kind of money home? What's there to be uneasy about? I wonder if the next class will be taught. I'm truly confused. Is the next class still on after this dismissal? With a "hooray," everyone dispersed. When I walked out of the classroom, I pulled out my watch again and saw that there were still fifteen minutes until the next class. No matter how beautifully decorated, it's always a mask. Shop clerk's correspondence: law is nothing more than human sentiment.</p>
<p>Li Jin, Editor: In this unfortunate situation, I am truly so grief-stricken that I want to kill myself. The matter is this: last spring, the manager of a store in which I had shares ran away, leaving a deficit of over ten thousand. I had to come up with thirteen thousand two hundred yuan to redeem myself. Our family's livelihood depends on this store. Now everything is over. As a result of my efforts, I managed to get a job at a foreign firm with a monthly salary of ninety-two yuan. In Shanghai, where the cost of living is as high as the sky, even maintaining the family's basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter is extremely difficult. As for the redemption money I should bring, the creditor has kindly asked me to repay it over ten years. But when I calculate it, wouldn't that be one thousand three hundred and twenty yuan each year? Almost my entire income is not even enough to offer to him, but can my entire family just be left unused? That is, of course, absolutely impossible. Therefore, I am unable to fulfill the first payment. The creditor is using my breach of contract as an excuse to sue me in court and apply for my pre-judgment attachment. But once I am really placed under pre-judgment attachment by the court, then my position will be jeopardized and my family will have no way to survive. I think the law is nothing more than human sentiment. My debt was originally caused by being implicated by others. The law shouldn't be so cruel as to force people to create something from nothing, right? Sir, please give me the best solution to give me a glimmer of hope for the future. (Remainder omitted) Bitter Li Jin.</p>
<p>Editor's note: "Law is nothing more than human sentiment" is indeed not wrong. Bitter Li Jun's debt was indeed incurred by being implicated by others and should be given understanding. However, we think that if those creditors were asked to simply recognize the loss, then their grievances would be many times greater than Bitter Li Jun's. Bitter Li Jun is the position of the store owner and has the responsibility of supervising the manager. Now that the manager has fled, the two words "failure to supervise" cannot be escaped. As for the creditors, whether they are sales staff of the store or depositors in the store, they have no way of knowing the internal situation of the store. Wouldn't it be even more unfair to make them suffer losses? In such circumstances, the law, based on reason and fairness, has no choice but to stipulate that shareholders are responsible. Moreover, commercial transactions are different from ordinary loans. The creditors' own financial resources are not necessarily strong, so they cannot be made to suffer losses. The above is only a study of the legal responsibility issue. As for the compensation method, it depends on the financial resources of the shareholders. If they are truly unable to pay, the court cannot force them to do so. Although the law is said to be a tool of capitalists, it is not as much of a slave to capitalists as all that, such that you come today to apply for pre-judgment attachment and tomorrow it will arrest people for you. So Bitter Li Jun need not be overly alarmed. However, Bitter Li Jun now has an income of ninety-two yuan a month, which, calmly speaking, is above the average person. Each month, he should at least be able to save some money to pay off the debt. If the cost of living is high in Shanghai, then he might as well send his family to the countryside. This is also something that should be done in terms of human sentiment. The "qi" of ordinary families should not be ignored. If the person who is responsible continues to live a comfortable life while the creditors are made to suffer losses, how can this be allowed by human sentiment?</p>
<p>Novel: Dreams of Time (Continued 2) Qin Shou'ou</p>
<p>(3) Grandfather? Benefactor? In a bedroom furnished purely in the Qianlong first year style, under the light of two Mobil lamps, on a grand redwood bed full of antique charm, lay a dying old man, constantly gasping for breath. The thin red silk quilt covering his chest rose and fell like waves, showing that his breath was exhausted to the extreme, and the final moment was imminent. Sitting in the room were three tearful faces full of sorrow, all facing the wooden bed, but none could muster the courage to cast their gaze upon the old man. Ugh, ugh... The old man let out a groan, his head moving slightly, as if he wanted to speak. A young man of fifteen or sixteen, with extremely delicate features, immediately tiptoed quietly to the bedside, leaned halfway down, and called out very affectionately and sadly, "Grandfather." Please tell your mother... to go... out... I The old man struggled to open his two withered eyelids, revealing two pupils half-covered in white, and uttered a fragmented sentence. Hurry and go! While the young man was still hesitating and delaying, the old man emitted a muffled guttural sound to urge him. There were two other women in the room, one was the old man's wife, an old lady with disheveled white hair, and the other was a middle-aged woman with a very haggard spirit and a very stern attitude, the young man's mother, the old man's widowed daughter-in-law. But after the young man conveyed the old man's order, she quietly withdrew. Grandfather... The young man returned to the old man's bedside, running on one leg, his face pressed against the quilt wrapped around the old man. Not grandfather... The old man widened his eyes as wide as those of a healthy person, and a layer of red clouds floated on his gray-white face, obviously due to a deep internal stimulus. His speech was also struggling very clearly. Poor child, let me tell you honestly, I am not your grandfather. At most, I am only your benefactor. Grandfather? The young man almost suspected he was mentally disordered. Not grandfather... I don't want to deceive you anymore. Although the old man's voice wasn't that loud, because there was no other sound in the room, the old lady sitting beside him heard every word without missing a single one. She couldn't help but sob and weep. Your father was really not my son. My son never had any children before he died. Tears were faintly flowing down the old man's face. After breathing for a while, he continued. The young man also held back tears, his face revealing extreme pain, and slowly rubbed his trembling hands on the old man's chest. But I can... guarantee... that you... yourself... are indeed surnamed Wu. The old man said the word "Wu" very clearly. The only difference is... this one... "Yi" is not... your... your biological... father... gave... you... I'm telling... you... your father was also a member of our clan, but you... are an unfortunate illegitimate child. The old man's words gradually gained the young man's trust, causing him to immediately feel indescribable shame and sorrow. Tears flowed down like raindrops, soaking the corner of his clothes, but he tried his best to restrain himself from making any sobbing sounds. Before... your... father... could... arrange... for... you... mother and son... properly... he unfortunately... died. Your mother also had... her inevitable... distress... In fact, she couldn't... raise you... poor child... don't resent her. For her own sake... she finally endured the pain... to send... you... out. The grandfather clock in front of the bed chimed nine times leisurely. The old man stopped speaking and listened, the sound of the clock truly resounding like a major incident in his soul, which was about to stop beating. At that time... our... son happened... to die. The old man let out a long sigh of helplessness. He died one... year after marriage... He didn't have any sons... or daughters... So we adopted... him... as... as my grandson. These things... I won't tell you now... but someday... someone will... tell you. So... I want... to tell you myself before I breathe my last. This was not any secret. The old man said a long passage, and he couldn't help but rest again. At this moment, the young man poured a cup of ginseng soup, brought it to his mouth, and slowly fed him a few sips.</p>

<p>Film Special: Barbara Stanwyck's Husband Control Techniques (Part Two) Si Ying</p>
<p>Third: Do not be overly honest and discourteous. "Husband and wife should treat each other with respect and courtesy" is a cliché, but it contains profound truth. For example, if your husband says to you, "My dear, I feel I'm getting too fat, don't you think?", even if you know he is indeed too fat, you must not openly dislike his weight or even laugh at him. You should give him constructive suggestions. For example, you can reply, "Yes, my dear, but that doesn't matter. If you can exercise, you won't be too fat." Your husband will always be grateful for this kind of helpful advice.</p>
<p>Fourth: Do not be stingy with your praise for your husband. As the saying goes, "No matter how much you wear, flattery never wears out." When you wear a new dress, you are sure to be happy to hear people compliment you. Men are no different. It doesn't cost you anything to say a few nice words, but the person who hears them is incredibly happy. Men especially like women's praise. So, when your husband adds a new suit, even if it's just a very small tie, you can praise him a few words to make him happy.</p>
<p>Fifth: You must remember not to invite unhealthy people to your home. "Unhealthy" here refers to those who are mentally unhealthy, that is, male and female friends who have bad tempers and constantly quarrel with each other. You must not get close to such people, because such people's problems are easily contagious to others, especially women who do not understand things and often arrogantly consider themselves awe-inspiring. Otherwise, if your mind is shifted by her, your family will be as uneasy as her family. On the contrary, you should often associate with families that are harmonious and exchange sweet and peaceful air with each other.</p>
<p>Sixth: You should practice your humor. If you don't have a sense of humor, this is very important, because there are many times when the atmosphere is naturally tense and marital problems gradually lead to one word from you and one word from me. Often, a sudden smile from one of the parties will dissipate the tension. Therefore, whenever and wherever, if you can always prepare some humorous jokes, then you will not be afraid of any difficult problems.</p>
<p>Seventh: Do not engage in unconscious talk. Know that silence is an excellent virtue. Even if you encounter something you don't understand, you can ask or discuss it, but you must not stubbornly insist on being right.</p>
<p>Eighth: Never play cards at the same table as your spouse. This is a very taboo thing. Often, wives are very harmonious on weekdays, but when they play cards at the same table, they become unhappy, resentful, or do not speak to each other for days. Because if one person plays a card and his wife says something to laugh at him, or if the wife sits on the right and the husband sits on the left and the husband's cards are not good, he blames the person on the right for not giving him cards to eat, which often leads to quarrels. This is a very ridiculous small matter, but it is indeed not easy to avoid and can cause serious problems.</p>
<p>Finally, and of course most importantly, do not rush into marriage. Before you get married, you must know your fiancé's temper and whether you have the possibility of assimilating to him or influencing him. This kind of thing cannot be resolved by knowing each other for two or three weeks. Therefore, according to Barbara Stanwyck's own experience, a year of association is absolutely indispensable. (The End)</p>
<p>Luo Mingyou's Four-Nation Doctrine Yin</p>
<p>Luo Mingyou, the manager of Lianhua Film Production Company, said in his speech at the Hua'an Building on the fourth floor at 7 pm on the 4th when he hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life: When Lianhua was founded, it held the four slogans of promoting art, propagating culture, enlightening the people, and saving the film industry as its intention and strived to this day to be able to arouse international attention and social sympathy. At the International Film Festival being held in Italy, Lianhua accounted for four of the five films participating from our country. This very honorable thing is of course bestowed by the government and the praise and sympathy of all sectors of society, but Lianhua does not dare to be complacent about this. From today onwards, it will actively expand and improve its content to make further progress. The goal adopted for future management of Lianhua is the four-nation doctrine of saving domestic films, promoting national essence, advocating national industry, and serving the country. I hope that all those present who love Lianhua will constantly promote and supervise it.</p>

The second song is "I Can't Bear to Part with You" (1) I can't bear to part with you. The past is remembered in my heart. Side by side in the moonlight, holding hands and strolling in the spring grass. I can't bear to part with you. (2) I can't bear to part with you. Boundless love and affection. I can't bear to part with you. (3) I can't bear to part with you. How easy is parting? For a moment and a half, I want to delay. Thousands of words are hard to say. I can't bear to part with you.</p>
<p>Hollywood Movie Actors Brew Strike Reuters, Hollywood, 12th The possibility of a strike by 15,000 movie actors exists. After the film companies declared today that they would reduce the salaries of actors by 25% to 50% due to economic difficulties, the professional union decided to oppose the salary reduction and sent an ultimatum saying that if the factory owners do not cancel the original plan for salary reduction, they will go on a general strike. Now, the film factory owners have announced that they are willing to submit the matter to arbitration.</p>

<p>Mamie, Trammell's Confidante Yu Lun The secrets of celebrities are best known by their servants. Mamie, the maid of Mary Trammell, has served her master for eighteen years. She likes her master's success more than her master herself. She said, "Trammell often says that she herself is not worthy of being noticed like this, but I (Mamie) often rebuke her for being unreasonable and say that no one else is as worthy of attention as she is." When asked by reporters if her master would retire, she replied, "She said she would retire thirteen or fourteen years ago, but she never will because she is too active." According to Mamie, her master rarely goes to the theater for fun, but likes to visit friends, because in the theater, she is often troubled by intrusive movie fans.</p>
<p>Educational Short Film: Two Orphans Xuanqiu Director Zheng Yingshi, after completing the directing of "Spring Tide," took advantage of the free time before filming the second film to compile a children's short play script, "Two Orphans," and served as the director himself. The leading actors are Yan Heming and Xue Lingxian's daughter, Yan Tongfen, and Hou Xiaoling. A few days ago, they tried filming in a private garden in West Shanghai, and it is said that the filming has been completed. Yan Heming is currently dubbing it. As for whether the short film will be shown at the same time as "Spring Tide" in the future, it has not yet been decided. When shopping in the store, Mamie acts as a guard. When strangers come to pester her, she helps her master get into the car and takes on the shopping task alone. She used to like to receive people, Mamie said, but recently she has been unable to do so because she is often troubled. Those who know her will forgive her.</p>

It is said that the film has been inspected and is scheduled to be screened at the local Xinguang Grand Theater on the 23rd of this month.</p>

<p>The scene of the filming of "City Night" was presented by Edward as a publication of the film novel "Gong Chun Se" (Tho Sign of th Otoss) (1) Lin Paramount Company produced, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, starring Frederic March, Elissa Landi, etc. The story is about the era of Nero.</p>
<p>Chloridor Layton, Claudette Colbert, When Rome was at its peak, there was a tyrant named Nero. He was licentious, tyrannical, and indulged in pleasure, and what he liked to watch most was fire. He often secretly sent his confidants and favorites to set fires everywhere, while he stood on the high platform in the palace and watched the flames soar into the sky and the people being burned by the fire, howling and running wildly. He embraced left and right, cheered and drank, thinking it was a joy.</p>
<p>Nero's queen was called Poppaea. She was beautiful, promiscuous, and extremely powerful. She could call on any of the men in the Roman aristocracy at will for her pleasure. Only Marcus, the mayor of Rome, she had not been able to get her hands on. Marcus's beauty was very famous, but he thought highly of himself and disdained to be the queen's lover. At this time, Rome had been peaceful for a long time, and the people had become accustomed to comfort and pleasure. Jesus had already been nailed to the cross. After his death, his disciples scattered, and many Romans turned to him. Their power became greater and greater, and Nero was extremely afraid. He ordered Marcus to find a way to eliminate the Christians.</p>
<p>One day, a big fire broke out in Rome again. The people vented their anger on Christianity and searched everywhere to kill them. The Christians were burned and had no home to return to and fled everywhere. At this time, two elderly Christians were caught by several slaves and were being whipped. Many people surrounded them. Suddenly, a young woman squeezed out of the crowd and beat the two slaves aside to rescue the two old men. The mayor came after a while. The crowd, fearing his power, all stepped aside to let him pass. He got out of the car and asked what was going on. The two slaves said that these two old men were Christians and they were going to be arrested and rewarded. The woman asked the slave what crime they had committed to whip them and asked the mayor to conduct a fair trial. Marcus looked at the woman's face. Her beauty had an air of heroism, and she had no fear or hesitation. Marcus's love had already arisen in his heart at this time. He asked her what her name was. She said her name was Marcia. The two old men called themselves philosophers. The two slaves shouted that they were Christians, but Marcus's whip was very powerful and he didn't allow them to say that again. Then he released the two old men and Marcia.</p>
<p>After Marcus waited for them to leave, he thought alone. What he was thinking about was nothing else, but the beautiful Marcia, who was as beautiful as a peach and as cold as ice. He ordered his deputy to find out where Marcia lived. He clearly knew that the two old men and Marcia belonged to Christianity. He also understood that Nero had authorized him to persuade the Christians to be exterminated. Now he gently released three Christians. His enemies in the court would definitely know about it. This was a great danger to him, but Marcus was fascinated by beauty and violated the emperor's decree by releasing the Christians.</p>

<p>Furthermore, according to a certain important figure from relevant circles, Jiang, Zhang, Song, He, and others discussed the overall plan for North China's military affairs at the Baoding meeting. Jiang was particularly concerned about the defenses along the Great Wall. The central government will provide full support to Jiang, who will reside in Shijiazhuang for a short period to oversee the overall plan for North China. The issue of Zhang's resignation was also discussed, but Jiang strongly hopes that Zhang will work hard in this environment and implement the central government's established policy. Regarding financial assistance, the government will try its best within its capabilities. (11th)</p>

<p>So-called Celebration of the Founding Anniversary of the Puppet State</p>
<p>The Populace is Forced to Be Filled with Sorrowful Emotions</p>
<p>Japanese Police Armed and Monitoring as if Facing a Formidable Enemy</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" Harbin dispatch, March 1st, states: Today is the anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo. Celebrations were held here following the orders from Changchun, but it was purely to carry out orders, with absolutely no joy or cheers. The people were even less interested in it, many preferring to stay away from the streets. Government offices carried out orders as planned. In the preceding days, local newspapers were filled with preparation news. Yesterday, the entire city was covered with red paper strips celebrating the occasion. The police forced each household and shop to alternately hang two puppet flags at the door, with a red paper lantern in the middle. The flags were all made in Japan, and the lanterns were locally made, all distributed by the police station. It is estimated that this expenditure by the people amounts to about 30,000 yuan, which, if used to help the hungry beggars in the streets, could at least feed 50,000 people for a week. As for the colored arches built by the city government everywhere, the cost is even more extravagant. This morning at 8 o'clock, all the officials gathered in the city park in the freezing cold for a speech. Afterward, a parade was organized, led by a one-day patrol officer on horseback, followed by 500 policemen, half carrying guns with bayonets and half wearing pistols. Then came the police chief, the mayor, and other officials walking, followed by representatives from various groups, schools, and the populace carrying flags. The fire brigade brought up the rear. The police forced each merchant to send at least ten people to join the parade, so the number of people was quite large, but there was absolutely no sign of joy or enthusiasm. The police ordered shops to close for a day, but all the shops remained open for business as usual, with none obeying the order. Only some vegetable and grocery stores had to close because their employees were forced to participate in the parade. The police stood guard every twenty yards along the parade route, with their guns raised, as if facing a formidable enemy. Such extraordinary security measures are rarely seen in celebrations anywhere in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Wuxi <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Appealing for Exemption from Increased Security Donations</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Security Committee, due to financial difficulties, previously decided to implement four types of donations: store donations, shop donations, steamboat and sailing boat donations, and local special product donations. The store donations were to be collected by adding one-tenth to the original house donation. The county government sent an official letter to the Municipal Funds and Property Management Committee to inform them. After receiving the letter, the committee considered that the donation was related to commerce and forwarded the letter to the County Chamber of Commerce for their opinion. Now, a reply has been received stating that business has declined drastically in recent years, and has been even more bleak since the beginning of spring. The city area donations are already heavy, and the people cannot bear any more. It is very difficult to bear the increased security donations. They request that the county government reconsider and submitted the decision of the first and second standing committee meetings to the county government, requesting exemption from the implementation. County Chief Chen has forwarded the matter to the County Security Committee for review and requested that other ways be found to raise funds.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Association Inspector</p>
<p>Bribery for Letting Goods Pass Exposed</p>
<p>The County Party Department of this county received a secret report the day before yesterday, stating that the current inspectors of the Anti-Japanese Association were privately contacting various silk and satin shops, accepting bribes to allow the Japanese goods imported by the various silk and satin shops to pass. The amount was fixed at several hundred yuan per month, to be borne by each shop. There is evidence to prove the facts, so please investigate. If the allegations are not true, they are willing to accept punishment. After hearing the report, County Party Committee member Shi Minyong was extremely angry and immediately sent an official, Zhong Yaozong, to investigate the various silk and satin shops. First, he went to Yongfeng, but the manager of the shop refused to produce the account books for inspection. Therefore, Committee member Shi went to the county government to discuss the matter with County Chief Tan. County Chief Tan immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to send 14 armed policemen to accompany him. As expected, in the account books of Yongfeng, Dahua, Meilun, and other three companies, it was found that they had paid "Anti-Japanese Association subsidy" or "Anti-Japanese Association donation" of a certain amount in early this month. After learning about this, the Anti-Japanese Association, in order to rectify the Association's prestige, immediately convened a meeting of all inspectors that night. As a result of the inquiry, it was found that the act was committed by a certain inspector, initiated by Tong Guozhang (who used to be a shop assistant in a silk and satin shop and is now an inspector), who contacted Gao of Xianfeng, and obtained his permission. He had only received the bribe once. The next afternoon (the 12th), the Anti-Japanese Association Committee held an emergency meeting and decided: (1) To immediately send Tong Guozhang, who accepted bribes and privately made donations, to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the County Judiciary for investigation and punishment for corruption; (2) To dismiss all current inspectors. Immediately, Tong Guozhang was sent to the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. On the afternoon of the 13th, when the Public Security Bureau escorted Tong Guozhang to the county government, the audience was extremely crowded. Then, Examiner Huang Cheng held a court hearing. According to Tong's confession, he took this measure because of economic difficulties. This time, he only received four yuan from Yongfeng and eight yuan from Dahua, totaling twelve yuan. The rest of the confession was similar to the above. He was taken into custody pending further investigation, but the Party Department and the populace advocated severe punishment.</p>

<p>National Products Exhibition Society Going to Liyang to Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>The National Products Exhibition Society organized by the Shanghai National Products Traveling Group previously arrived in Wuxi and held a meeting at the First Public Park. All the goods were sold at any time, and the business was quite developed. Now, the director of the society, Xu, because the term is approaching, originally planned to go to Zhenjiang. Because the procedures in Zhenjiang have not yet been completed, he decided to go to Liyang first and has sent personnel to contact them. The address is set at the City God Temple. On the 11th and 12th, the goods from various factories have been sorted and registered, and they are being transported to Changzhou by the Wheel Bureau. The procedures have also been completed.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Our Army Fights Bloody Battles Against the Enemy Outside the Pass <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Killing 3,000 Enemies and Capturing 500</p>
<p>Our Army Suffers Many Casualties, Please Provide Swift Rescue</p>
<p>Various organizations in Shanghai received Zhu Qinglan's telegram on the 3rd, reporting on the bloody battles of our army outside the pass, the arduous fighting of the Volunteer Army of Chaoyang and Lingyuan, and the suffering of the wounded officers and soldiers. The summary is as follows: (1) To all organizations, the true enemy, with the majority of its forces, about two divisions, launched a fierce attack on our Song Zheyuan's army, advancing by land and air, firing intensely from about 40 to 50 meters from our position. Our army calmly responded to the battle. Afterward, because the enemy pressed us even more, our army launched a bayonet charge and drove the enemy back. Our army launched an attack at 2:00 AM in three routes. Zhao's brigade advanced from Panjiakou, and Tong's brigade advanced from Dongjiakou, circling behind the enemy and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, killing more than 3,000 enemies and capturing more than 500, obtaining countless guns, cannons, and ammunition. Fighting is still continuing intermittently. However, our side's equipment for fighting the enemy is slightly inferior. In addition to food, etc., which this association's representatives from Shanghai's organizations are providing as appropriate, this is specially heard in Lanwen. (2) To all organizations, a true telegram was recently received from Li Yong, Commander-in-Chief of the United Ladder Regiment 13 of the Northeast Volunteer Seventh Army Corps, and Liu Zhengzong, stating that Li Zhenjiu led the puppet army to attack Hunshan Xiaojiadian. The writer has already made defenses. Yesterday, he led Zhang Zhixian, Xu Laopin, Sun Duobao, Song Huamin, Li Qingfu, and others, more than 2,000 people, to attack Daguantun Junsongshugou Hengtinghezi, killing more than 30 Japanese soldiers and obtaining 17 guns and 35 carts. The true enemy, Fu Qing and Li Yue, two commanders, circled and attacked the Japanese army of Chaoyang and Lingyuan, and their rear was empty, and they fled in droves. The populace rose up to resist. Please urgently notify the national army on the front line to launch a fierce attack without missing the good opportunity, etc. In addition to cabling the military authorities for consideration and handling, since the loss of Rehe cut off communications, the resistance situation and preparations of the various volunteer armies here cannot be clearly understood. Now, upon receiving Li Liu's telegram, it is clear that the volunteer armies in various places on the border of Rehe are still fighting hard. There are many supporters, but it is worrying that there is no way to provide assistance. He is concerned and mindful, so this telegram is sent. Zhu Qinglan Wenzong. (3) To all legal organizations, it is clearly known and secretly connected that the battles at Xifengkou and Gubeikou have been fierce and abnormal in recent days, with flesh and blood flying everywhere and a terrible sight to behold. The enemy's losses are enormous, and although our army's morale is boosted, there are many casualties. Currently, medical and rescue efforts on various routes are extremely simple, and wounded officers and soldiers fill the roads, groaning and moaning. It is a sad sight. It is hoped that you will promote and quickly raise medical supplies and organize large-scale rescue teams to come north day and night to work to comfort the soldiers who are glorifying the nation. Zhu Qinglan bows and asks Wenzong.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Discussion with the Battlefield Inspection Group of the Youth Association <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Rehe is Easy to Defend but Difficult to Attack</p>
<p>The Fall in Ten Days Was Due to Poor Planning</p>
<p>In order to serve the battlefield, the National Association of Chinese Youth specially sent official Nan Chengfang and others to the north a month ago to join the Youth Associations of Beiping and Tianjin to form a Battlefield Inspection Group to personally inspect the battlefield, to clarify the needs of the front line and enable the combined youth members to make contributions. Mr. Nan returned to Shanghai on the 12th of this month. The reporter from Shen Shi News Agency visited him yesterday to inquire about the real situation of the Rehe battle. Mr. Nan said that Rehe</p>
<h3 id="e70">Lofty Mountains and Majestic Ridges <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Everywhere are natural fortresses. Taking Gubeikou as an example, the mountain walls on the left and right are steep, with only enough space for one vehicle to pass through. It is easy to defend and difficult to attack, truly a case of "one man guarding the pass, ten thousand men cannot pass." Even the fierce power of airplanes and artillery would be unable to wreak havoc. How could the natural fortress have been completely lost in just ten days after the Japanese army began its attack? This is not because the natural fortress was unreliable, but because of poor planning. According to the writer's investigation, the reasons for not defending are approximately four:</p>
<h3 id="e71">Traffic Obstruction <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Rehe has many mountains and roads are rugged. There has been no transportation construction on weekdays. There is only a car road from the north to Chengde, and it is uneven, with no road base. The road surface is submerged in water. If it is not a special route, it is impossible to drive. Transportation equipment is also very scarce. There are only a few cars, and the supply of cars is even more difficult. Sun and Yan's troops were ordered to go to the front line. The vanguard arrived at the front line a month later, but the baggage and supplies were still in the Gubeikou area. Using camels and horses to transport them, each carrier only carried two artillery shells, staggering along the road. Speed is important in military operations. How could we not be defeated in this way? Second is</p>
<h3 id="e72">Lack of Food <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Rehe has few farmlands, and in recent years, the authorities have forced the planting of opium, so there is a severe shortage of food. The people are poor, and not only do they not have money to buy food, but even if they have money to buy it from outside, there is no way to transport it into the province. The people have already felt the pain of insufficient food in peacetime, and now that the army has suddenly increased to more than 300,000 people and more than 300,000 horses, the supply of food and fodder is even more lacking. How can we last long if we fight on an empty stomach? Third is</p>
<h3 id="e73">Financial Constraints <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Rehe has more than ten counties, and the annual tax revenue is only 2 million yuan, and the opium tax is more than 1.6 million yuan, while the annual military and administrative expenses require more than 4.8 million yuan. It is a very large number. Tang Yulin's army of 20 years only received four months of pay. The army was usually dissatisfied with Tang, and at the time of this war, it did not accept Tang's orders. Once Tang ordered the artillery regiment to go to the front, the regiment refused to obey. Then, after each person was given a few yuan, they departed from the province, but they still lingered on the way and did not reach the front line. The financial situation of Rehe Province was originally very tight, and the war made it even more panic. One yuan can be exchanged for more than 60 Rehe coins. The financial situation is chaotic, the morale of the people is not high, and the morale of the army is shaken, so the war is unfavorable. Fourth is</p>
<h3 id="e74">Difficulty in Command <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Before the Rehe War, there were no less than 200,000 volunteer soldiers gathered in Rehe. Tang Yulin's army originally had 32,000, and several tens of thousands of Northeast Army also arrived. The military strength cannot be said to be weak. However, because each army acted on its own and did not unite, the left wing was in danger, and the right wing sat and watched. There was no overall military plan or unified command. The difficulty in commanding large officers was the main reason for the failure. Later, Zhang Zuoxiang took over as commander-in-chief, but it was already too late. The writer met with Tang Yulin when he was in Rehe. At that time, Tang's attitude and conversation seemed quite determined. Unexpectedly, in a hurry, he</p>

<p>Some say that Tang had a secret pact with the Japanese, which does not seem to be true. Because Tang is昏庸 and corrupt, the Japanese are also unwilling to raise him. On the way, the writer also met with the American Mr. Huaertuo. Mr. Hua has lived in China for a long time and is very familiar with the situation in the Far East. He recently inspected Japan and the Northeast and told Ping that a large number of Japanese people have already</p>

<p>Wage Donations to Support Aviation for National Salvation</p>
<p>Party and government agencies have been notified to comply. Factories will deduct and pay the money to the Municipal Government. All sectors at home and abroad are enthusiastically donating. On March 12, the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, the government stipulates that factories will be closed for one day, and wages will be paid as usual. The various labor unions in the city, in view of the fact that the outside world is deeply advocating that the wages earned on that day should be donated to support aviation for national salvation, have been approved by the central government. The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government have been ordered to comply. The details are recorded in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Notice from the Municipal Party Department <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department issued a notice stating that this notice concerns the fact that March 12 is the eighth anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. This Association has repeatedly received inquiries from various labor unions about whether to close down as usual and many suggestions that the wages earned on the Revolutionary Memorial Day be donated by the labor sector to support aviation for national salvation. This Association believes that the labor sector is so enlightened and patriotic, and it is very commendable. On the 7th of this month, it was telegraphed to the central government for review and instruction. Now, according to the central government's secret reply, Yang Dian has been approved by the Standing Committee to handle it. In addition to the letter to the government for handling, it is specially replied. In addition to the letter to the Municipal Government to forward to the various merchants and factories to deduct and pay the Revolutionary Memorial Day wages to the Municipal Government, it is necessary to publish this notice to urge all labor unions and merchants and factories in the city to comply with it in order to alleviate the national crisis. This is very important. Special notice.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Order from the Municipal Government <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to obey the order. It was ordered that Song Dai, the Director of the Executive Yuan, stated in the telegram that the National Government's Civil Service Office had ordered that the wages to be paid to the labor sector on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death should be used for donations to aviation. You are to instruct them to comply with it. This is because the country is in trouble, and it is the time for the people to work hard to love the country. At the juncture of frequent foreign invasions, donating to aviation is especially important. The reason for the order is that you should follow the order without violating it.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Scout Mobilization <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Aviation Association's campaign to solicit members and raise funds in the city began, the team leaders and members of each team have been actively working, and the results have been very good. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, who is also the commander-in-chief, is still afraid that some citizens in the city are not fully aware of the direction of aviation for national salvation. He has seen that in the cities where the Japanese have settled in Manchuria, the number of Japanese immigrants has increased by two-thirds. Observing the history of China, the Yuan and Qing dynasties first obtained the Northeast and Rehe before driving south to conquer the Central Plains. If China does not quickly rise up to save the situation, the future will be extremely dangerous. The current strategy is still to counterattack, otherwise, without attacking, it will retreat, and there will be no way to defend it.</p>

<p>Peaceful in the Evening, Precautions Gradually Relaxed</p>
<p>The academic community will hold a meeting today to commemorate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chinese Concession Police Department took temporary precautions yesterday in light of the 50th anniversary of Marx's death, because it was afraid that the Communists would take action. The Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen specifically ordered his subordinates to step up precautions. Double posts were temporarily set up at key roads in the South City and Zhabei. Supervisors and detectives were dispatched. All the police stations in the Public Concession and the French Concession were ordered to be on alert. In the eastern and western parts of Shanghai, where factories are densely populated and there are many workers, precautions were especially strict. Temporary Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at Xixin Bridge and Risheng Building. Although reactionary slogans were found on electric poles and walls in the eastern and western parts of Shanghai, fortunately, it was peaceful in the evening. However, the Chinese academic community will hold a meeting on March 14, the 50th anniversary of Marx's death, to commemorate him and famous people will give speeches.</p>

<p>Will Take Office at Headquarters Immediately</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that Colonel Gilgore, the newly appointed commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, and his wife arrived in Shanghai on the President Hayes Wheel. This morning (13th), they took the naval shuttle to the New Customs Wharf to disembark. Acting Commander Colonel Sais led the officers and staff of the regimental headquarters and the band and guards to greet them at the wharf. The Bureau of Public Works also sent a cavalry patrol team to stand in formation to pay their respects. Colonel Gil stepped ashore and reviewed the military salute, then shook hands with each of the greeters. Then, the cavalry patrol led the way, followed by the band and the guards, who accompanied Colonel Gil to the regimental headquarters to take office. It is scheduled for tomorrow (14th, at 10:30 a.m.), all officers and soldiers will gather at the Nanjing Grand Theater, where former acting commander Moresais will introduce the new commander. It is reported that Colonel Gilgore had previously come to Shanghai with the Marine Corps in 1927 and stationed there for three years before being transferred back to his country to serve as the Adjutant General of the Headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps in the Pacific region. On Christmas Eve last year, Colonel Heck, the former commander of the 4th Regiment, died suddenly of illness, and the U.S. government sent Colonel Gilgore to Shanghai to succeed him.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Shanghai scouts will be fully mobilized to take the lead in the fight against the Japanese and defend the country. Mayor Wu Tiecheng is concerned that some citizens in the city are not fully aware of the importance of aviation for national salvation. He has specially requested that all Shanghai Boy Scouts be fully mobilized on the 18th and 19th, that is, Saturday and Sunday, to be presided over by Director Wang Gangjun. The whole group will be divided into 54 sections, and each section will be assigned a number of Boy Scouts, led by a responsible leader, to distribute aviation national salvation leaflets door-to-door along the street, so that all citizens will be clear about the opportunity to join the Aviation Association. The names of the participating Boy Scout groups and the names of the commanders are recorded below.</p>
