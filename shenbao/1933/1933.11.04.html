<p>昌黎　張熙光二日到前方後、當派員入城，向匪作最後勸告、匪態度仍頑强、不肯就範、並將我入城代表擊傷、我遂决定、於拂曉攻擊、匪竟於三日晨三時自南關出竄五百餘人、被我迎頭痛擊、兩方遂發生激烈戰事、我砲兵亦加入作戰、在南關擊斃逃匪極衆、匪不支退入城内、計自晨三時至十時、槍砲聲迄未停、又戚文平及某方又出頭接洽繳械、我因匪態度始終狡猾、尙未作答、（三日專電）</p>
<p>（北平）　撫寗城内現有殘匪二千餘人、均無作戰經騐、子彈給養多已告罄、故極恐慌、惟城内漢㚥恐匪繳械後、失去保障、唆使匪衆頑抗、企圖延殘一時、現我保安隊已將撫城東南西北四關、完全嚴密圍守、各最前線與匪僅五十餘米、故總攻令下後、即時可將撫城收復、鄚桂林股匪七八百人、竄踞延慶·榆樹·濼女匪小老鵰亦混入、（三日專電）</p>
<p>（天津）　省府對濼東土匪、仍希望覺悟來降、每步槍一支、給洋三十元、輕機槍一支給洋百元、重機槍給洋百五十元、迫擊砲每尊二百元、二日晚對撫寗城未總攻、予匪最後考慮機會、而老耗子態度崛强、城内有匪三千、决不降、保安隊總指揮張熙光三日晨下令攻城、情况如何、三日晚尙無報告、（三日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>内蒙自治與華北經濟之前路</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>内蒙各盟旗要求自治之醖釀。雖非一日。但各王公類多安分守已。不願多事。一般蒙民政治水平亦甚低。政治要求並不十分熱烈。故迄今未見有若何過分之實際行動也。吾人試觀錫林郭勒盟副盟長德王領銜所發請願自治之電文。覺其理由。甚爲薄弱。與實際問題。亦不無出入。蓋德王在職司上。僅爲錫林郭勒盟之副盟長。在爵位上僅屬郡王。以彼出而領導内蒙自治。在舊王公方面。旣不足以資號召。在新的方面的蒙古青年。尤不甘心受其領導。以是所謂自治會議。雖曾屢次開會。而仍無確實結果。就原則論。内外蒙古與内地各行省。語言文字。旣互有差别。而社會經濟結構。復大相懸殊。遊牧經濟與農業經濟。在歷史上誠有相互接連之處。惟生産關係。差異特甚。上層之政治。自難治於一爐。則内蒙之要求自治。殆亦勢所必然者也。</p>
<p>不過内蒙六盟。因東省失陷。熱河淪没。遂致卓索圖昭烏達哲里木三盟。淪爲另一區域。内蒙自治。在我國所能確實領導者。僅察綏兩省北部。錫林郭勒。</p>
<p>烏蘭察布伊克昭。等三盟。則地哉雖廣。而人口僅三十餘萬。行政上又已劃歸察綏兩省區。欲圖脫離省政之指導。另起爐灶。其是否可能。吾料中央及地方長官。必已加以詳細考量矣。且現在内蒙各部旗之一般經濟趨勢。正在由遊牧經濟轉換成爲農業經濟。易言之即開墾日漸發達是也。夫東盟已失陷之三盟部旗中。類多放墾已成之熟地。農業經濟。日漸發展。此中情况。姑置不論。即西部二盟中。如五原臨河。已設縣治。農業進展迅速。出産豐富。因河套天惠之故。大有壓倒牧畜經濟。另樹楷模之槪。於是政治組織。當亦必隨之而起變更。吾恐内蒙王公所要求之自治。不足以適應此新興之經濟情勢。而合乎農業人民之要求也。</p>
<p>今日内蒙邊境所處地位。北接外蒙。東南瀕遼黑與熱河。處處受强隣之威脅。内感不安。外被誘惑。如熱河省内之林西。日本密探在該地以經營貿易爲名。勾引各部旗王公。并私設無線電台。時歷數年。受愚者大有人在。是内蒙東盟各部。日居險境而不自知禍亂已發而猶自矜傲。此則非僅内蒙人民之不幸。實亦我國未來之巨大隱患也。夫以農村經濟組織已成之人民。且不能抵禦外侮。圖自已更生之道。况爲遊牧經濟逐水草而居之蒙人。其能阻遏敵國之陰謀。應付外蒙之脅制乎。</p>
<p>就國防關係而論。無論在地理上人事上。現時内蒙。皆居特殊地位。交通雖尙不便。而軍事上正與整個國防發生極重要之關聯。在往昔交通工具笨拙。武器未發達時代。荒漠千里。或能阻遏敵騎之深入。勉强爲華北之屏障。亦未可知。現則時移勢易。舊日之蒙古騎兵。再不能制服坦克車與飛機之横行矣。更就經濟形勢論。遊牧經濟。地區散漫。人口稀薄。以與有組織之農業社會抗。尙難必勝。况發達至於極頂之資本主義乎。今姑置政治關係與國防問題不論。而單就内蒙之經濟狀况。加以分析。從前我國政治中心尙在北京時代。蒙古出産。在我北部。猶居相當重要地位。對外輸出貨品中如皮革羊毛駝毛等爲數頗多近則外蒙出品。旣經由西比利亞另謀出口。而張庫交通。又復阻滯。非特内蒙本身痛感日趨貧苦。即華北各主要城市。亦受極嚴重之影響。蒙莫大之損失矣。</p>
<p>總之今日之内蒙無論在政治上經濟上。均與我中國有極密切之休戚關聯。非如往日之疏遠。更不能任其另自成立統系。故内蒙自治問題。必須與地方自治。處於相同地位。宗敎思想之不同。應在文化上求解决。經濟結構之差異。須於經濟上求調劑。否則易爲强隣所乘。終非蒙古之利。亦非我華北之福。今日爲國家計。惟有善用蒙古青年改進之熱誠。撫綏王公内向之好意。以徐圖轉機之一法耳。</p>
<h3>日本毒禍我東北　飛機散傳單鼓勵種罌粟　年銷達三千三百萬日金　國聯會議美代表嚴辭痛斥</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯顧問委員會舉行公開會議、美代表富勒發表警策之言論、述中國東北諸省之鴉片貿易現狀會衆聆之、殊爲驚愕、富勒氏謂近今遠東、尤其爲滿洲熱河、麻醉品事態之發展、美國覩之不勝驚訝、例如違犯中國法律、設立所謂鴉片專賣、此實可稱爲麻醉品非法貿易之唯一最大企業其設立專賣、志在推廣鴉片之吸食、現政府指僞國一區之預算案、估計鴉片專賣之餘利、其數約達每年日金一千萬元、其所銷之鴉片、每年約達三千三百萬日元、規模之大、可以想見、富勒於是詆賣國聯中日顧問委員會、不應對在武力佔據下建成之臨時政府所發之執照提議予以承認、而助其規避條約、美政府不知此種手續是否實在適合一九一二年海牙公約、故渠對國聯顧問委員當中國對滿洲主權仍由列强承認時提出此種建議、及破壞海牙公約以便利滿洲烟土運輸之任何建議、特表示反對、富勒繼謂鴉片之充斥、已使滿洲與熱河之吸者爲之大增、且其産生之數、大逾其本地銷費之數、恐其餘剩者將違法運銷中國内地云、中國代表贊助富勒之言論、謂實與中政府之意見脗合、意代表對遠東鴉片嚴重之事態亦表示意見、日代表僅請將富勒之言論完全公布、此外未發一言、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>鴉片專賣　破壞國際行動　日本政策實甚險惡</h3>

<h3>日軍閥　又醖釀政變說　惟齋藤仍抱樂觀</h3>
<p>（南京）　荒木陸相對於農村·敎育·思想等問題之態度、頗爲各方面注目、且預料陸相將於下次閣議、表示某種重大意見、然荒木陸相因察知各閣員對於國内政策之意見與陸相之所信、大有懸隔、除非有重大决意、難見其國策之實現且齋藤首相對於陸相之提議、態度極爲消極、陸相鑒於此種事實、暫時觀望形勢、亦未可知、但軍部方面對於内閣之無爲、已有不滿之聲、前途頗堪注目、（三日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　陸軍大演習業已終了、預算之編訂亦正在着手、因是政治季節即將由是開始、惟其　途曾有種種見解、因有下列二說並傳、致政局前途甚覺微妙、其一爲政友貴族院之一部、軍部方面之所謂政變說、其所持理由爲（一）在一九三六年之非常時局前、實行各般設施、在齋藤内閣不免無此手段、（二）五相會議所定之外交國防對策雖經曲折、但根本方針、業已樹立、惟於内政問題、或謂暴露無誠意、母寗謂爲默然的態度也、（三）即於時局之認識、閣員間見解尙不一致、顯示閣内之不統一（四）擔任非常時局者、具有皇國精神之具體化、强有力之内閣、係屬必要、但民政黨以及首相之側近者對之、則抱有以下之樂觀的見解、（一）在預算編成之前後、例年皆有政變說之謡傳、實則並無可憑之根據、（二）齋藤内閣以後之内閣、不但無從思念及之、抑亦無使現内閣辭職之難關、（三）當預算編成、因軍事費在五相會議之後、必可告成、至於其他部份、可由高橋山本兩相結果之也（三日電通電）</p>
<h3>印日會議　已瀕决裂地步　日方將提最後提案</h3>

<p>（東京）　廣田外相訓令日代表團、其内容大體如下、印度提案之綿布進口量與賣出印綿數之比例、爲印綿一萬包、與綿布二百萬碼、以價格比之、即爲百二十三萬元、與三十萬元之比數、其比率爲四對一、頗不平均、日本要求改爲二對一之比率印度進口綿布時期、每年分四期、並按照種類分别待遇之辦法、日本絶對反對、又印度以「長碼」爲量綿布之單位、要求印方明確解釋其槪念（三日日聯電）</p>

<p>「剿匪標語」、（一）全國民衆總動員、一致起來、剿滅赤匪、（二）赤匪是勾結第三國際出賣民族的罪人、（三）赤匪是赤白帝國主義的忠實走狗、（四）赤匪是利用外患趁火打刦危害國家破壞治安的公敵、（五）赤匪是殺人放火屠殺民衆的劊子手、（六）赤匪是買空賣空欺騙農工的敗類、（七）要鞏固國家提高國際地位必先剿滅出賣民族的赤匪、（八）要打倒帝國主義、必先剷除勾結赤白帝國主義的赤匪、（九）要發揚民治、必先勦滅破壞地方治安的赤匪（十）要攘外必先安内、要抗日必先勦匪、（十一）軍隊勦赤於前方、人民勦赤於後方、「動匪口號」、（一）赤匪是民族國家的蟊賊、（二）赤匪是赤白帝國主義的走狗、（三）消滅屠殺民衆的赤匪、（四）肅清殺人放火的赤匪、（五）撲滅欺騙農工的赤匪、（六）勦除出賣民族的赤匪、（七）殺盡破壞農村經濟的赤匪、（八）剷除阻碍地方自治的赤匪、（九）軍隊勦匪於前方、民衆勦匪於後方、（十）全國民衆總動員勦滅赤匪、（十一）勦匪成功萬歲中國國民當萬歲、中華民國萬歲、</p>
<h3>萬縣安川貨通　外輪放棄萬縣</h3>
<p>入川共匪徐向前向侵占宣綏後、即欲越嘉陵江而東下、意在攻取萬縣、與鄂川邊共匪聯合、達到封鎖東川目的、在上星期内、萬縣形勢非常緊張、故川中客帮、紛電上海止辦川貨、近自劉湘所派大軍到萬後、人心略定、萬縣貨物稍可運輸、僅上游華輪、則已完全徵作軍運茲將關於此事情形、並川當局接洽外輪復航萬縣經過、經本報記者查明、分述如下、</p>
<h3>上游華輪全停</h3>
<p>航行揚子江上游宜昌重慶及上海重慶間之華商輪船、自上旬萬縣吃緊後、即經劉湘徵調裝運軍隊、宜渝間華輪、祇留民生公司數船行駛、旋因省軍大隊東下、運輸輪船、不敷應用、又將民生公司輪船亦全數徵調差用、致上江線内、中國江船、今已全行停航、	劉湘當緊張之隊、尙擬租用洋商輪船裝兵、怡和已表同情、嗣因捷江未允、遂作罷論、</p>
<h3>萬縣人心漸安</h3>
<p>萬縣自十月二十三日起、發生大恐慌、川帮中止運貨、近日省軍二十一軍第五師·與第三師·均陸續開到、萬縣一埠、軍力已超過二萬、人心因之大定、刻下省軍與共匪作戰之地、尙在宣漢綏定間七里岸一帶、故川東及下游各地轉較平靖、商貨於軍隊保護之下、可以稍資流通、</p>
<h3>川帮電告辦貨</h3>
<p>上旬川帮停辦滬貨後、滬上應運宜萬渝各埠去貨、如大批棉紗·疋頭·等項、悉皆阻留滬上、堆滿各棧、近自省軍至萬以後、川帮已發電來滬言萬縣可保無事、所有日前止辦之貨市上急需流通之應用貨品、可以酌量裝運、惟大批貨則暫緩、故太古之金堂、與捷江公司之輪、前昨均已運貨入川矣、現在川河航輪、祇有英美洋商船行駛、本月十六日起、疋頭運費、將漲起二元一噸</p>
<h3>外輪不往萬縣</h3>
<p>萬縣一埠、爲入川要道、上海去貨甚夥、四川大批桐油、亦多從該埠裝船、故自萬縣慘案發生以後、當地川商、即拒絶外輪到該埠、迄已多年、致太古怡和等輪之行駛川河者、均不能靠萬縣裝卸客貨、昔年楊森主川政時曾與外商接洽向英航商衆七十萬元罰欵、方可准予恢復、此事遂致無形擱淺、以迄今日、近自劉湘統一四川後、對於萬縣外輪復航問題曾提出與英航商接洽、准予恢復行駛劉湘曾於上月、派代表來滬、與太古怡和等磋商、如英商能納付十萬元稅欵、即可准其行駛萬縣、但英商以萬縣桐油·中國輪無油艙之船英輪即不往萬、油商爲便利裝儎計亦必轉至宜昌裝其輪船、故對於納稅行萬之事、决計置之不理、對萬縣一埠、表示放棄、</p>

<h3>廣西路子彈四飛兩盜一受傷一成擒　三盜白晝搶刦烟兌店　探捕得訊後合力兜捕　一盜兎脫二盜被圍困　槍聲密集中一傷一擒</h3>
<p>昨日上午十一時許、雲南路發生盜刦、當時崗捕即尾隨不捨、在廣西路慈德里内雙方發生格鬥、一盜被逸、一盜生擒、一盜當塲擊傷、茲將各情紀述如下、</p>
<h3>三盜行刦</h3>
<p>泰鑫錩記烟兌號、開設雲南路福州路口天蟾舞台斜對面、第二零零號、係常州人沈叙洪（年四十八歲）所開設、已歷十有餘年、以地處歌台舞榭中心、故平日生涯、甚爲不惡、而沈亦藉此稍有資蓄、不料竟被匪徒垂涎、當昨日上午十一時許、該號櫃外突來身穿玄色長衫之男子三人、由一男子上前、聲言購買香烟、同時尙有二男子、即開啓店堂前鐵栅向内直奔、各出手槍、嚇禁店主堂櫃及學徒等聲張、並趨於屋角、實行看守、櫃外之盜、即在店門首望風、由另一盜坐上帳台、打開帳櫃、將該號内貯鈔洋數十元盡行刦去、先行退出、望風及監守二盜、亦隨後出店、同向該號北面福祥里内逃逸、</p>
<h3>前無去路</h3>
<p>當時沈叙洪見銀錢被刦、並見盜等已逃入福祥里、乃與學徒吴大華兩人先後追出、奔至里口、狂呼捉强盜、附近第四三三號及三二零九號兩華捕聞得呼聲急循聲而至、得悉前情、即拔槍追入福祥里、但該里一端直通廣西路、三盜見後有追捕、即穿出福祥里、越過廣西路、逃入對面慈德里内、兩華捕一見恐被兎脫、乃亟狂吹警笛、警告附近崗捕兜捕、一面亦相偕追入慈德里、但中有一匪、當時見後面緊追不捨、即於穿出福祥里時、向他方奔逸故逃入慈德里者、僅有兩匪、旋見崗捕步步緊迫、知難再前、乃折入該里北弄、希冀由此脫身、詎該北弄係一死弄、盜等見去路全無、乃擬返身竄出、</p>
<h3>雙方激戰</h3>
<p>但斯時兩華捕已趕至、當前攔阻、盜等進退不能、竟情急向兩捕開槍、於是兩捕亦開槍還擊、頓時慈德里内槍聲密起、子彈四飛、行人倉皇奔避不及、激戰移時、内中一盜、首被兩捕擊傷倒地、尙有一盜見事不妙、即將手槍抛棄、舉手就縛、斯時四面崗捕亦已趕到、乃將生擒受傷兩盜及手槍兩枝一併押入老閘捕房、後以傷盜受創甚劇、即送入巡捕醫院醫治、生擒之盜、經略一審問後、據稱在逸之匪現匿居閘北某處、捕房乃通知公安局押經領捉、但無所獲、當即續派探捕四出追緝、該受傷之盜共中八槍、均在足腿等部、故傷勢尙無大礙</p>

<h3>程硯秋訪問記</h3>

<p>服裝特刊第九期</p>
<h3>旗袍的遞嬗</h3>
<p>— 有行</p>
<p>穿衣和吃飯，是兩種大不同的享受：穿衣是客觀的，從人的；吃飯是主觀的，從已的。就因爲穿衣服不能由着自已的主張，所以要學時髦，於是便有了時裝。性格固執的人，在男子方面比較多些，所以男子時裝不大有人說得出是怎樣的顯着，並且變異得極遲緩。</p>
<p>關於旗袍的故事，也很有趣。十多年來，全中國有個極大衆的享樂，就是愛聽或愛看梅蘭芳演戲，梅君廣交遊，除開本國的闊老達官名媛閨秀之外、還結識大多數駐在中國的公使，公使夫人，領事，大商人等等。梅君應酬時總是男裝的，短髮的，但並不减於戲裝女子之美！碰巧在民衆有選梅君做中華總統的狂熱中，女子剪髮亦同時成了風氣，偶爾有慕梅君風采一試男裝而被人發見確是新鮮美觀；於是所有的女子剪短一頭髮就穿上一長衫！有人看出义下的褲子認爲有傷大雅，又想起滿洲女子的旗袍原極别緻，當時就採用了不開义的旗袍。那時候巴黎有個歌舞明星密司丹蓋特被聘到紐約去戲藝，在渡大西洋的輪船甲板上被人發見了她那雙腿有獨到的美點！厥美女子服裝忽然剪去幾乎一半的長，我們的旗袍亦被波及到的。一九三○年歐羅巴小姐選出時，那些評判委員曾經解釋說：她全身比例上，頭部僅佔去八分之一，有古希臘女子之美。爲了要顯得頭小，又祇好加長衣裳，旗袍仍逃不掉這個影響，並且把領子提高袖子减短，亦不爲了頭大頸短不時髦的緣故！同時開义提高，不願把尙未看厭的腿遮着。</p>
<p>旗袍的故事要到何年何月何日才能完結？我們無從預料，我們希望上海仕女自已來改裝，或是自已來繼續旗袍的新故事。（成了時裝便成了故事，任憑牠是怎樣的新！）</p>
<h3>本星期内女裝　變動消息</h3>
<p>— 編者報告</p>
<p>關於女子的旗袍，照本刊第五期所繪的襇袍形式裁製的，已逐漸流行；就是在衣义裏用雙縐綴着長襇，像百襇袑的樣子，是非常飄逸美觀。旗袍的面子，大槪是用瑪瑙葛做襯絨。</p>
<p>關於大衣，大槪用深色的呢絨，皮領已不全縵在領上，而離開領邊一吋的模樣所以好似皮領上用本色的呢鑲一闊　滾一般。而皮領却黑西耳居多。</p>
<h3>歸國以後（上）</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>在浩浩森森的一片大海之中，一艘大郵船劃着白浪在那裏進行，一縷縷的白烟裏在半空，彷佛和白雲爭研，一頭頭的白鷗，在海面上飛來飛去，一會兒却在白雲和白烟中隱去了。</p>
<p>那時海面上風平浪靜，明明如鏡，恰象徵着郵船中那一對海外歸來的佳耦，兩下裏相親相愛，無猜無忌。他們倆正在甲板上，肩並肩的傍着鐵闌干立着、不住的喁喁情話，不時有銀鈴似的笑聲從那女的口中發出來，和船底下湯湯水聲相應和。</p>
<p>Ｃ君是一路歸國來了。他在德國學醫，已有五年之久，辛勤了五年，總算是不虚此行，因爲他的行囊中，已多了一張醫學博士的文憑，而他的身旁也多了一位碧眼金髮的德國夫人，這是他五年來奮鬭的戰利品，足以傲示國人而使他躊躇滿志的。本來呢，他在德國住了五年，又娶了個德國夫人，一切生活和一切習慣，都已完全德國化，早就忘了他的故鄕，忘了他故鄕的父母和兄弟妹妹，更忘了他五年前食毛踐土，息息相依的中華祖國，他預備長住在德國，而終老於德國了。但是他的夫人却不以爲然，說：「你是中國人，不應當忘掉中國，我雖是德國人，但旣嫁了你，那我也就是中國人了。你不願回去，我却偏要回去，看看這數千年的文明古國。」Ｃ君是個性很强，可也不敢不聽他夫人的話，於是收拾行裝，帶同夫人買棹歸國。</p>
<p>Ｃ君的故鄕是上海，也卽是那大郵船的目的地，在某一天的早上，Ｃ君夫婦倆終於是到達上海了。Ｃ君久居德國，從没有發過鄕愁，此次師國，又是曲從夫人之意，所以見了故鄕，倒也淡漠得很。轉是他的夫人十分奮興，一上了岸，就像個金絲雀似的跳來跳去，看看這樣，看看那樣，咭咭呱呱的說個不了。伊很熱烈地吻了Ｃ君一下，黄鸞兒掉舌似的說道：「親愛的，這是你的祖國。我愛你，我也愛你的祖國。」Ｃ君只淡淡一笑，打諢似的答道：「吾愛，你只須一心愛我夠了，愛上了别的，那我可要吃醋的啊！」</p>
<p>Ｃ君雖到了故鄕，却不敢同他的夫人到他那陳腐不堪的家裏去，見他那兩位老古董式的父母，爲適合於他的歐化生活起見，先就在一家第一流的外國旅館中住下了。一連三天，伴着夫人遍游全城，但是他的目的所在，又多年是純粹歐化的電影院西餐館和跳舞場，而不肯給夫人看看東方的風物，深恐玷汚了夫人的一雙尊目。轉是他夫人不耐煩起來，說：「這些場合，我在本國早就領略得厭了，爲甚麽不給我領略些兒貴國的本地風光？」Ｃ君没奈何，纔勉强的請夫人吃了一頓廣東飯，又到城隍廟裏去走了一遭。</p>
<p>○　　○　　　○　　　○</p>
<p>Ｃ君師國以後，一轉眼已一個多月了。他先租了一宅三層洋房，安頓他的夫人，一切家具和裝飾，當然是十足的歐化，一日三餐，也章華毛羢紡織廠織造工塲之一部</p>
<p>非西餐不可。但他對於日常的生活，還是感覺種種的不滿，甚到咒詛中國的空氣不好，不合衛生。夫人聽了，兀自暗暗好笑，心想他在德國住了五年，竟變成了洋迷，隨時隨地的在輕視祖國，連愛國的大義也已抛在腦後，那必須糾正他的錯誤纔是。</p>
<p>Ｃ君雖常在咒詛中國的空氣不好，然而他不知怎的，歸國不到半年，却漸漸地發胖起來，先前在德國所製的西服，已件件都不稱身了。他連上了幾家上等的西服店，竟找不到一種滿意的衣料，於是他又咒詛了，他咒詛中國眞是個没出息的國度，自已旣製造不出呢絨一類的衣料，連採辦舶來品，也不會揀選上好的輸運進來，這樣没出息的國度，不亡是没有天理的了。夫人聽了這種喪心病狂的話，很覺刺耳，但也不做理會，心想趁此機會，對症下藥，醫可他的洋迷病。伊原是一位冰雪聰明的女子，只悄悄地一想，就得了計較。</p>
<p>一天早上，他請了一位敎會中的女友做嚮導，上中國綢緞鋪子去，買了許多綢緞，喚一個中國成衣匠給伊量了全身的尺寸，裁製了好幾件中國式的女衣，甚麽旗衫旗袍，半臂長袴，一應俱全，不上半月，都已製成。伊就在朋友家裏，卸下西服，穿起旗袍和長袴子來，花枝招展似的走回家去。Ｃ君一見大爲訝異，短着半個舌子，期期艾艾地說道：「親愛的，你！你怎麽穿起這種腐化的衣服來？」夫人嬌聲着答道：「中國的衣服，何嘗腐化，我覺得它的舒適，遠在西服之上。你對於西裝的衣料，旣都不能滿意，那我勸你還是改穿中服吧。况目中服的材料，全是你們自已的國貨，你是中國人，也應當多用中國貨啊！」Ｃ君苦着臉道：「不不不，你們女人家穿穿中服，也未始不可，可是我們男子，定須穿上一身西裝，纔見得精神抖擻，你還是替我留意留意西裝的衣料吧。」夫人拗不過他，只索答應了。</p>
<h3>時裝及其經濟之影響（續）　奇特的志趣狂亂的裝飾</h3>
<p>— 許弢</p>
<p>時裝是文明民族的</p>
<p>在上面我們已把時裝及其經濟之影響，約略的談過了：但各人的評論將攻擊嗎？不，决不；至少在我個人的意見。雖是一切的誹論和法規來禁止，但時裝總是繼續的永存於世界，同時時裝還是社會最願意，最以爲好的，所保護着的果子。並且在事實上，一種更受誹論禁止的時裝，往往反而最易盛行於社會。還有一點，我們也應注意的：服裝的變化，其實最　合自然的了。因爲自然界景色的變幻，却獻給我們一種印象，一個模樣。在生活上，常時看到同樣的服裝，同樣的顏色，不免使人有單調生厭之感。不同異樣的人類，竟可證明優勝於四季不變羽毛的禽獸。我們可以說，時裝的無恒，確是不可治的輕薄，遥遠的證據，證明人類高尙易變的文化。因爲時裝是富於出産的，同時對於生産的變換，有促進精煉一切想像思想的效力，在未開化的民族中，一件兒的衣服，往往能保留幾世紀的永續。我們可以說，這樣民族的文化，停留不進的了。相反的，在文明的民族裏，服裝繼續不斷的改變：由此可見廣大自由和猛速進步之證實呢。</p>
<p>我們可以拿這句話來作本文的結果：在藝術之國裏，最可愛的意義上，婦女應用了藝術，美妙的藝術：就可自誇盡完了一個責任了。（完）</p>
<h3>山洞口的黑綿羊（下）</h3>
<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>我說照老兄這樣說，一條褲子，出了這種毛病，主要全部放棄麽，他道「這倒未必，還有一個補救方法，」我說「我雖然是個瘦子，這種補救方法，倒也要請敎請敎，」他這纔凑上一步道：「除了送上織補店裏去，「打補釘」之外，難道還有别的秘方麽！」</p>
<p>中秋節那天，我狂半淞園，走個假山洞的時候，忽見洞裏面黑越越的好像有幾個人，爲首的一個幾乎把那洞口塞用美氅緞所製晨大衣</p>
<p>住，我一見這團黑影，便聯想到顯煌的身軀，因爲有一天我和他上永安公司買東西，在那電梯門口，因爲人多的緣故，他被擠得不出不進，那副狼狽情形，使我忍不住笑出來，我正在回想着笑的時候，那黑影忽然探了個頭出來，不是别人，原來就是顯煌。</p>
<p>我一見了他，心裏非常喜悅，再朝他身上一望，原來是穿着新的藏青嗶嘰西裝，所以在山洞裏越顯得黑了，我道「老李，又添新服裝了嗎。」他道，「是的，這是章華廠的國産出品，已經穿了三個多月了，」我朝他肚子上一打量，接着問道，「織補舖子裏，想來已經去過了，」他道「還是昨天補好的咧，」脫着，用手指在大腿上點給我看，我一時莫明其妙，抓着頭道「什麽，毛病不在褲擋裏麽，」他一聲大笑，把手指　裏的香烟，朝我面前一揚，說道「腿上是個香烟洞，褲擋裏至今還很完整，大致没有問題了，」他還很得意的接着說道，「這一個小小香烟洞，格外證明了章華呢的質料高尙，不易擦破，因爲香烟燒着的地方，發生一股焦臭氣味，要不是純羊毛的，那裏有這個味道哩！」</p>
<p>我說「哈哈，原來如此，怪不得以老兄這般偉大的尊軀，穿了新洋裝，捨得來鑽這個山洞！」</p>
<h3>海外歸客之服裝談</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近黄瓊斯女士自法歸國，佘訪之於寓所，談及法國服裝情形，至饒趣味。黄女士言：服裝之要素至多，而命名與花色，最占重要位置，命名之新奇别致，固然可以引動顧客之注意，而時新鮮艶之花色，尤能吸引一般婦女之購買慾。法國人之服裝，變化最多，色樣最新，每經一度之變化，卽有一度之進步。其風行之衣料，不過一二天内，卽有銷售一空之槪。大致歐美各國之時色服裝，均隨巴黎都市爲轉移，各國之服裝公司，以及綢緞棉布之店舖，都惟巴黎人之馬首是瞻。其努力之大，可見一斑。黄女士談畢，余叩以曾參觀中國國貨工廠出品否？黄女士謂美亞綢緞，章華呢絨，鴻新布疋，確能出人意外，爲中國國貨品增光不少。卽以命名而論，美亞之糺縵縐，珊瑚縐，瑪瑪縐，錦地縐等，鴻新之蝴蝶呢，綺井格，安琪格，進步呢等出品，命名何等雅馴而有深意。繼介紹與鴻新胥仰南先生談，并參觀其工廠，黄女士深許其第營之匠心，進步之神速，謂其有四優點：</p>
<p>（一）顏色鮮艶，可保持不退。（二）花樣斯奇，饒有雅靜之致。（三）價格低廉，極合經濟原理。（四）物質堅固，耐於穿着。胥君佩其知言，且願時時就敎，以臻於盡美盡善之境云。</p>

<h3>振盪的穩定</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>發射機中對於振盪管振盪的穩定與否，是極其重視的。假如振盪管的屏電壓不穩定，那未振盪也不能穩定，發射機的效力也不會好的了。附圖是一種穩定屏極電壓的線路。10是作爲振盪管用的，牠的屏壓用一千二百弗打的電源供給。兩隻50作爲穩定10屏電壓之用。牠們在正規的屏壓之下有一定的屏流，每隻約四十至五十千分安培。以兩隻50和10的負荷及一萬歐姆和六十瓦特燈泡的阻力來降低電壓供給10屏極。C電壓大約是四百弗打。在正規的情形之下，50的栅極所受的電壓就是Ｃ電壓减了AB之問的電壓降。現在假定供給屏極的電壓忽然升高不止一千二百弗打，於是電流也要增加：因此ＡＢ間的電壓降也增大了，同時兩隻50栅極所受的電壓便小了許多。其結果50經過較多的電流，使六十瓦特燈泡所經過的電壓降加大，於是振盪管仍得所需要的屏電壓不受電源電壓升高的影響。Ｃ電壓和兩隻電阻如果用得適當，電源電壓的變動如不出百分之五十以上，那末10屏極可以得到一定不變的電壓，因此振盪穩定，發射機效力大增了。上述電壓的穩定方法性質和濾波器彷佛，因爲牠也把不穩定的顫動電壓弄得平穩，作用和濾波電容器一樣。不過牠需要一個大容量的Ｃ電池罷了。其他用途之如何，是在讀者之舉一反三。</p>
<h3>振盪的鎭定</h3>
<p>— 陳杞杯</p>
<p>裝置高週波放大最易發生振盪，足使全機失其效用故必須配以鎭定器而避免之。現在略舉數種寫在下面以供同志參考。</p>
<p>最簡易的方法是將天線回路與栅回路線圈繞製時使其方向相反，如第一圖之L1及C2，即可阻止振盪。</p>
<p>又一種方法在高週波輸出綫圈裏接一反相線圈，及一只鎭定電容器以平衡眞空管之電容量。（如第二圖之L2及L3）L3之圈數及C2之電容量須試騐决定。</p>
<p>如果在高週波輸入處用一綫圈及一只鎭定電容器亦能奏效（如第三圖）　　又一種方法是在高週率放大眞空管之栅極上接一六百至八白歐姆之電阻，亦爲有效之鎭定法。（如第四圖）</p>
<p>第五圖的方法是在高週率輸出處用雙線　繞的綫圈如L2及L3oL3如普通接法L2則一端接B一端接一中和電容器C2活動片，將C2固定片接至眞空管之栅極，亦能有效。</p>
<h3>自動再生式</h3>
<p>— 魏心蘇</p>
<p>凡再生式收音機，都有一個控制回授的設計，使收聽的人多一種管理的廠煩。至於自動再生式，只消最初經過一度校凖，以後就不必另費調節的手續了。</p>
<p>如圖所示：綫圈Ｌ爲普通栅路線圈，L1爲回授線圈。Ｌ及Ｌ１藉一個雙連可變電容器Ｃ的配調同時與外來電訊諧振。在檢波管屏極上之射電週率電流經過阻扼電容器C2（Blocking　Condenser）回饋與配諧再生線路。電容器C1是一只交連電容器。</p>
<p>倘使在C1内没有容電，L與L1發生磁感交連，那末屏極回授電流便會在配諧刻度盤之電容量低容量低落一端增强。如在C1内容有一種電量，L與L1不發生磁感交連，那末回授作用便會在刻度盤電容量高的一端增强。</p>
<p>我們如使L與L1的交連及C１的電容交連到一種合宜的程度，我們可以獲得一個回授量在整個配諧刻度盤上不發生變化。</p>
<p>關於自動再生式的構造，下舉幾點須加以注意：線圈與配諾電容器須正確，兩線路的引線長短必須一律。C1的電容量及磁感的度數須憑考騐求之。與天線交連不可過密，否則檢波秋栅路諧振必致受迫而使各綫路均衡破壞，且常爲在回授中造成死點（Dead　Spcts）之原因。</p>
<p>檢波管屏路上之射電週率扼制線圈於獲得平滑與穩定的使用甚關重要RFCI須具有阻扼射電週率電流於配諧波帶以内之能力。RFC２大約85M.H.C325oMMF.o</p>
<h3>眞空管的脫綫</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>眞空管是無線電的心臟，因之眞空管的病是研究無線電者必須知道的，眞空管的内部結構，日新月異，複雜的製造遠非一時所能說盡的，現在憑我個人過去所得的經騐來報告一下眞空管的脫線。</p>
<p>有一次我的一隻四七號眞空管突然不能應用了，我自知十分謹愼，並不損壞内部，並且這隻眞空管才用過半年，壽命决没這樣短的，於是我開始檢查，起先查得燈絲的二隻Ｆ脚已不通，我更懷疑，但是拿眞空管側向之後又發現Ｆ脚已通，試騐了半天，才知道燈絲並没有損壞，於是我拿眞空管放在温水中，使燈下端的膠木部脫離，我便發現了並不是燈絲已斷而是燈絲通燈脚的銲接處脫銲了。</p>
<p>不外，我的一個初步着迷於無線電的朋友跑到我的家裏來告訴我，他在舊貨店裏買到了一隻八○號眞空管，祗及新的五分之一的價錢，但買回應用時是已損壞了的，不能燃着燈絲了，用電表試騐時燈絲又没有新，我拿了他的八○號眞空管想了好久，突然想到了上回的事，立刻拿眞空管的下端膠木部取下，果然發現了舊貨店裏的詭計，原來在膠木部的二根從燈絲通下的線脚接在一起，分開後拿電表一試，裏面的燈絲是斷的，因爲有幾種眞空管的水銀層很厚，所以在外面不能看出眞空管中的燈絲是否已斷。所以我希望愛好無線電者到舊貨店中去買眞空管時千萬不要因爲價格的便宜而忘了他們的詭計，這雖然是很小的一件事，但我想上了當的一定不少，所以提出來說了一說。</p>
<h3>音量調節法（續）</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>有幾種新式眞空管，（如51，35，58等）牠的放大係數，是隨C電壓的多少而變換的。因此，在陰極線路内添一可變電阻，也可調節音量，新式收音機使用此類眞空管時，大槪都採用這種方法。</p>
<p>調節音量的方法，最好在高週率線路内着手，如果收音機未用高週率放大，那麽在檢波管未曾過載（Overload）狀態之下，低週率線路内也可使用音量調節。</p>
<p>在第一級低週率變壓器次級綫圈或第二級初級綫圈上，並接一可變電阻，（如第三圖）假如輸入的低週率未曾過荷失眞，也可得到滿意的結果。　　在高聲器的接綫柱上，並接一個可變電阻，也可調節，也可調節音量。　　成績最佳的，當然要推自動音量調節法了。牠不僅能自動地調節音量，並且還能避免衰落，（Fading）減少天電。不過使用很不經濟，（須另添一眞空管）不是貴族式的收音機，很少裝設。牠的原理，已詳本刊第十三期，這裏不再贅述。</p>
<p>現在把上述的各種音量調節法，列成一表，以便讀者採擇。</p>
<h3>聆餘漫談（三）丨國内播音界之現狀丨</h3>
<p>— 微言</p>
<p>（上海）　上海廣播事業，始於民國十一年。起初有美國人呌做亞司蓬的，創辦中國無線電公司，曾設五十瓦特的播音臺一座。以辦理不善，三個月後即停頓。接着美商新孚洋行，亦曾一度發音。以營業不振，半載後亦告停止。十三年夏，開洛公司成立，先造一百瓦特的播音臺，後增加電力至二百五十瓦特。此爲上海有正式播音臺之始。當時開洛公司播送的節目，多爲西樂及外國唱片，中國唱片佔極少數。嗣經華人力爭後，即添加商情，時事及彈詞等節目，但西人節目仍佔多數。十六年新新公司附設五十瓦特的播音臺一座，專播該公司各種游藝節目，當時極爲聽衆所歡迎。民十八，開洛公司以營業不振而停頓。同時新新公司亦適停播，一時收音機幾成廢物。此時亞美公司附設之上海廣播電臺，在困難環境中，不顧一切，毅然開幕。於是埀終之中國無線電廣播事業，又告復興。最近二三年來，無線電播音臺之添設，猶如雨後春筍。節目之多，尤難勝數。一時蓬蓬勃勃，薰蕕互見。</p>
<p>有人批評上海各電臺的播音節目，祗有十個字，呌做：「有電皆廣告，無臺不說書」。這話雖覺言之過甚，但是多數的電臺，却是這樣的情形。譬如在每天上午聽到的，差不多盡是廣告。什麽：「價廉物美」「買一送一」「破天荒大减價」「不顧血本」……等等聲浪，他們是很純熟地報告着，好似小學生背誦敎科書一樣。聽衆們聽了，幾乎要疑心上海是便宜市塲，賤賣總匯。一到下午，說書節目，便陸續開始。待到晚上，聽到的不是唐大爺和秋香，便是樊家樹和沈鳳喜。說書先生一面叮叮咚咚的彈着三弦，一面逼緊着喉嚨唱着詞句，這時上海差不多要變成說書世界了。</p>
<p>作者今夏回鄕（松江）時，蟄居無聊，專以收聽無綫電播音爲消遣。因此覺得最近上海各電臺播音的節目，確有相當的進步。有幾家已經達到以「學術爲主，以娱樂爲輔」的目的。現在謹以個人見聞所及，略致狂辭於左：</p>
<p>（SHHX）　上海廣播電臺的節目，選擇最爲謹嚴。學術節目，佔居最多。對於無聊節目或淫穢唱片，絶對不播，（作者曾親聆該臺謝絶聽衆要求不正當的唱片多次。）尤足令人欽佩。不過該臺因背景關係，報告時營業氣味太重，使人聽了未免不快。又解釋無綫電問答時，時常帶有倚老賣老的口吻，這一點也使人聽了不耐。</p>
<p>（UHHX）　大中華廣播電臺的播音，最是悅耳動聽。報　時的聲浪，尤其清晰。今春該臺晚上播送章練先生生的二胡獨奏，並雜以琵琶及國劇等。（有時並請小弟弟小妹妹等奏唱歌劇或報告一切，雖不甚老練，却也别有風味。）當時該臺電力爲五百瓦特，播程遥遠，極爲各埠聽衆所滿意。後來該臺因某種關係，將電力减小至五十華特，播程便大爲銳減。（在京極難收到）最近該臺節目雖多，但已不及以前那樣情形了。</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>最近蘇俄之廣播情形　不久以前，一千瓦特的廣播電台，就算强力電台了。現在美國的强力發射機是五萬瓦特。新新納梯的WLW電台，正在裝置五十萬瓦物的機件。並日蘇俄也同時在計劃百萬瓦特的設備。無線電工程師葛恒博士曾　蘇俄政府之聘，最近回到美國，他在工程師恊會華盛頓支部會議席上，講演他旅行蘇俄的實况，曾說：「蘇俄現在已有一個五十萬瓦特的電台，五個十萬瓦特的，與五六十個一千到二萬五千瓦特的。蘇俄政府對發射電台與收音機同樣準備，因爲同是政府的財産。電台愈强，則適當的收音機可以製造得愈便宜。反之，電台愈弱，則收音機愈貴。政府想根據這種理論，正在研究，在第二個五年計劃裡，是否應當增加五十萬瓦特的電台，還是應當建造一百萬瓦特的。現在蘇俄已有三百萬無線電收音機，五年内想增加到二千萬。廠家每年可以造六十萬具。五年後將年出一百五十萬具一。</p>
<p>— B.Y.</p>
<p>鷹王牌新到六燈機　鷹王牌Majestic六燈收音機，曾於八月份到初次新貨數十只，該機製造新頴，内部各件，完全採自最新出品，收音可抵八燈之清晰，故不一週而新貨已告售罄，是足見此機之新式可靠也。此次到貨，計二百餘只，各電料行聞訊，卽往批購一百餘只，計　種式樣，其餘輕便六燈機，交流直流兩用，及汽車用收音機，尙有一百餘只，陳列南京路二十號惠勒公司樣子間，日昨往購者甚多，故近來六燈新機之銷路，甚爲暢旺云云。</p>
<p>鶴鳴廣播電台本月起播送楊乃武　楊乃武一案，遜清時轟動江浙兩省，長官以此去位者不乏其人。後經編成彈詞，一度在無線電中播送，歡迎者甚衆，惜半途中止。茲悉南市中華路鶴鳴廣播電台應聽衆之要求，特聘彈詞家張少泉彈唱楊乃武，自十一月三日起，每日下午六時至七時按時播送，想爲各界所樂聞焉。該台週率一四四○千，電力三十瓦特，播音素稱清晰云。</p>

<h3>戲班子</h3>
<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>有一家戲館，必得有一副戲班子；有一副戲班子，必得有生，旦，淨，丑，各種脚色，然後方能敲起鑼鼓，唱起來做起來。弄得好，就可繼續一年半載，弄得不好，只有再開碼頭。</p>
<p>有一個衙門，必得有一批官吏；有一批官吏，必得有什麽長官，主任，辦事員，書記，各種名稱，然後方能貼布告，坐公堂，擺起來，搖起來。弄得好，也可繼續幾年，弄得不好，就要改組。</p>
<p>本來官塲如戲塲，說起來也着實相像，你且聽道；官吏之有組織，猶戲子之有班子也；官吏之貼紅布告，說奉令就職，猶戲子之登廣告，說擇吉登台也；官吏就職時之奏樂演說，猶戲子登台時之打鬧台，跳加官官也；官吏之拜會紳商，猶戲子之拜會各界名人也；官吏之發表政見，猶戲子上場念引子也；官吏之等因奉此，猶戲子之唱做也；官吏之有頌揚德政，猶戲子之有捧場唱采也；官吏之受彈劾；猶戲子之被喝　采也；官吏之提出總辭呈，猶戲子之合同滿期也；官吏之有攀轅臥轍，猶戲子之有挽留三天也；官吏之調任他處，則猶戲子之開碼頭矣。</p>
<p>戲子唱來唱去，不過這幾句老調，可是人還是愛聽；而官吏做來做去，也是這幾個老套，人却聽得不耐煩了，這是官比戲子難做。化幾個錢，可以買一個官做；但是再化多些錢，買不到一個戲子做，這又是戲子比官難做了。總之，各有各的好處，各有各的難處，死鬼肚襄明白；我没有做過菉豆兒大的官，也没有做過跑龍套的戲子，可就不知其詳了。</p>
<h3>泥男水女</h3>
<p>— 紀于</p>
<p>我記得前幾年，女界裏有一句成語；呌作黑漆板凳，就是Husband的變音，也就是呌伊們丈夫的名詞，你想；做了丈夫，就變爲黑漆板凳，豈不大觸其霉頭？凡是有做丈夫資格的，只好給伊們坐在屁股頭，這可以說一聲是侮辱男性。</p>
<p>後來男子受了氣，想出一個報復的法子來；說女子是花瓶，只好供玩賞，裏面裝些水，挿挿花枝，豈知伊們又不願直受，有幾位出來反抗；說他們男子一定要喊吾們做花瓶，吾們就請男人做花瓶底下的座子，這麽說來，男女做了花瓶座子，也只好纔女子坐在屁股頭，這和黑漆板凳是同一的意義。說來說去，女子在上面，男子在下面，男子吃了虧，女子佔了便宜，不過做了黑漆板凳，還可以活動一些；因爲女子不是一天到晚坐在板凳上的，如果做了花瓶座子，簡直一年到頭没出頭，鎭日價被女子壓在下面。</p>
<p>近來還有人說；女子是個菩蕯，理由是伊們打扮得妖妖嬈嬈，呌人去崇拜伊，因此呌伊們菩蕯；又有人說；菩蕯兩字，要男子來當的，理由是男子大都西裝革履，像煞有介事，外表是好看，裏面却是一包草，好像一位裝金的泥菩蕯</p>
<p>我不帮和尙，不帮尼姑，寳二爺說；女孩子是水做的；男子是泥做的；這句話眞不錯，尤其適合在現代男女之間，渾渾噩噩糊糊塗塗的當兒，你瞧；只要把泥浸在水裏，或是把水冲在泥裏，那時泥裏有水，水裏有泥，泥和水混合化，泥即是水，水即是泥，再也分不出泥是泥水是水，却變成一碗爛汚泥湯了！明白了這個道理，大家再也不要拿什麽俏皮的名詞來互相侮辱了！</p>
<h3>宛米山房盆景之</h3>
<p>— 赤壁　　孔志清作</p>

<h3>譚鬚</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>這一回，全運常務委員行政院秘書長褚民誼先生，爲了游藝會演劇助振的那一天；他老人家也粉墨登塲，大獻其色相，在觀衆的面前看起來，可稱政界中心人物一個極熱心的慈善官兒；且聽得他在患演草橋關渭水河前，竟把頷下的美髯，用快利的并州剪刀先行剪去，再將剃刀剃光，一個于思于思的鬍子，忽變了像面白無鬚的摩登少年；在首都各省健兒雲集的時候，遂至轟傳，可見偉人的一毛一髮，也不是小可，前人說「拔一毛而利天下」，這名話眞是不錯，像褚先生這種舉動，實足以當之而無愧了。</p>
<p>實人的鬚，看雖似没有多大的關係；儻一翻從前的紀載，本來狠有趣味的一段史實；從歷史上講，周有辭（亂作治字解，）臣十人，那中間閎天的面上，竟不露皮膚，據說因鬢髯的多，遮蔽其貌的緣故；而伊尹的面，還要生得奇怪，不必說没有鬚，并眉也没有；周靈王在呱呱墮地出世的當兒，已生了髭，號稱「髭王」；漢時劉邦也美鬚髯，漢壽亭侯埀五綹長鬚，最最少見的，婦女們也曾生起鬚來，在古書裏頭，也有可考的掌故不秒；所以關於鬚的文章，自古認爲有價値的；此次不要怪許多記者們，要拍電詳載褚先生棄鬚的經過哩！</p>
<p>不過就鬚的本身分别，也像有些關乎命運；譬像曹孟德割了鬚，但想避敵，夏馥棄了鬚，只要逃命，于緋截了鬚，因爲討老婆，豫讓滅了鬚，可改變本相；鬚是一樣的鬚，而所以和鬚脫離關係，宣告永訣，這就大不相同了；不但這樣，像張華且在鬚上纒起綵帛，加以點綴，齊帝拿紅繩束得像一索一索，掛在胸前，這般看鬚，是非常重視；若裴晉公率性將鬚燒了，以爲可以博得高名，謝靈運的鬚遂倒楣，他方捨了鬚，頭也就落地了；從這許多人論，豈不是鬚也有幸有不幸麽？褚先生現在雖剃了鬚，且爲了難胞，而犧牲父母的遺體，實可欽佩，况他說剃鬚算不得什麽一回事，不久就可以生出來的，這種襟懷，何等偉大啊！</p>
<p>吾時常看見，有一般留鬚的人們，認爲是「美容術」的時髦一流；像軍界中出身，多是八字鬚，一二新元老，多是帶髮連鬢的，可長至及腹，京中有三大鬍之稱，（褚先生爲三者之一）就因此而來；年歲未老，也不肯不拿鬚來裝飾，留在鼻孔下，遠望像兩黑點，說是摹仿日本式，又像海京伯馬戲班當中的小丑角，這似近乎太滑稽了；區區一鬚，要像褚先生，已經不容易；但褚先生的鬚剃了後，尙無人發表過，這種種的鬚不曉得在那兒；也當保留，以作紀念，纔好；吾想做一篇招鬚文，題呌「鬚兮歸來」。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫壻怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>江氏淡淡的笑道：你别爲人家的豆子炸了鍋啦。我倒要說一句時髦一點兒的話，你自已的那一位，現在也是心裏難過着萬分呢，你倒不去瞧瞧他嗎！趙自强站着微笑了一笑，望了他的父親，却没有動脚。趙翁道：這也没有什麽害臊的，你應當去看看楊家姑娘。趙自强剛把脚移了兩步，又停止了。趙翁正了顏色道：你應當去的，你還猶疑什麽？趙自强聽了這話，這才將臉子綳住着，走向前面院子來。他走來的時候，脚步是很快的。及至他走到了前院楊家屋門邊，把脚步就放緩了，輕輕的拉開門來，又咳嗽了一聲，這才舉步進去。祇見桂枝在靠門的一張方凳子上坐着，低了頭，正在作針線活。見趙自强進來了，就放了針線站起來，低聲微笑道：你回來啦。說時，手扶了桌子，旣不曾向前走一步，也不曾向後退一步，半側了身子，向趙自强望着。他走了兩步，將軍帽取下來，拿在手裏，然後向桂枝笑道你一個人坐在家裏，不悶得很嗎？桂枝微笑道：我那天也是這樣子在家坐着，怎麽今天就會悶得慌呢？趙自强究竟還不敢表示了十分親密了，就隔了門，在外面一條舊板凳上坐下了。桂枝在裏面屋子裏轉了一會子。好像很忙，趙自强道：你忙什麽？你坐下來罷，我還有幾句話和你說呢。桂枝笑道：你老遠的來了，我也應當倒一杯茶你喝啦。趙自强道：與其在家裏喝茶，自們不如到乳茶舖裏去談談還强的多呢，桂枝搖着頭道：不去也罷。今天去了，談的自然是很高興。將來我一個人有到乳茶舖去的時候，我是多麽感慨。（二三○）</p>

<h3>回了故鄕丨吉林</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>回到故鄕，是五月間的事情。行前，第一個對我表示異議的是木天，不，他簡直是根本反對，有幾次他甚至於向我發着脾氣說：</p>
<p>「你簡直是胡鬧！大連檢查那樣嚴，日本人能放你那樣一個年青人過去麽！扣下你怎麽辦！」</p>
<p>不管他怎樣發着脾氣，我總是用一句老話笑着回答他，「不要緊的，你讓我試一試。」</p>
<p>「不是試不試的問題，問題在於有個好歹，犧牲了太無意義！你明白麽！」</p>
<p>說句老實話，我是「明白」的，我也承認木天的話是對的，不過在那時我還是要說着試一試的話回答他，不管他怎樣勸解，阻攔，發脾氣。再有向我表示異議的人，那就是尹庚，默平，紫洲他們三個了，他們不贊成我冋去，都給我以善意的忠告，要我愼重一些，萬不要因爲急於回家，忽略了險惡的環境，而致犧牲了性命。</p>
<p>可是我終于走了，終于在大連通過了檢查，平安地回到了我的第二故鄕吉林。</p>
<p>想一想在大連受檢查時的情形，至今還覺得怪有趣的。船傍岸時，上來幾個穿西裝的滿洲青年，他們就是檢查員了。他們是看人行事的，我因爲没有變更裝束，立時引起了他們的注意。其中一個走到我的眼前，開抬盤詰了。</p>
<p>「上那兒去？」</p>
<p>「吉林。」</p>
<p>「甚麽名字？」</p>
<p>「李ＸＸ。」</p>
<p>「幹甚麽的？」</p>
<p>「學生。」</p>
<p>「那個學校？」</p>
<p>「ＸＸ大學。」</p>
<p>「爲甚麽回來？」</p>
<p>「念不起了，家裏没有錢供給。」</p>
<p>他還問我結婚没有，家裏有多少人，所有他問的一套話，我事先早都預備委妥的，回答的並不顯得不自然，他找不出什麽破綻來，過一會，再仔細看看我，就走開了。我帶了一個箱子，他連看都没有看。就這樣算作檢查了，就是一般人傳說狠厲害的檢查丨此之謂「厲害」，那能不讓我說聲「怪有趣的！」</p>
<p>到吉林後見到了親朋故友，他們在會面後，簡直有如在荒年中得到了意外的收穫，差不多都用着　想不到的口吻說：「不容易，不容易，大連好走麽？」這，我才知到大連一關，關係確實重大。所幸我竟能在平易中度過了關口，也許這是我的運氣特别好吧？。</p>
<p>到吉林看看，還是從前的吉林，除了多添了些日本買賣，多修出幾座樓房外，大致和從前没有什麽差别。不，不這麽簡單哪，我看到街上苦力比從前多了，乞丐比從前多了，舊商店倒閉了很多。從報紙的載記裏，看到槍案的發生成了一件平常的事情，學生比從前少了好多倍。還有，新的五色旗到處飄楊着，王道主義救世的標語，貼的滿街滿巷。日本兵覇佔着東關地帶，他們同時却又握有統治全城行政，軍政，警政的權能。他們的威權高出一切。</p>
<p>朋友們問我說，你覺得吉林和從前有無不同的地方，我說有的，我把我看到的不同的地方說給他們了，我還以吉林的學生没有消沉盡而自慰，因爲在我回到吉林的幾天，正有一件學生被捕的案子，被捕的原因是學生們在黑夜中撒着反對日本帝國主義的傳單。雖然人被捕了，從事情的本身上說，不能不說是有着相當的意義的。</p>
<h3>夢</h3>
<p>— 林籟</p>
<p>隣居張家菓園裏的李子熟得透明了，可恨偏要留着發賣，連我們孩子偷着在樹下望上瞧一眼也有張三伯緊跟着，正是這樣一個没有辦法的下午，我的堂哥說是他的母親告訴他山後長滿了不要錢的野菓，這個消息馬上由我傳遍了我們的一夥，不到一刻鐘，我們十幾個人就赤手空拳爭先恐後地出發了，時候是將近斷黑，路怎麽走，當然没有考慮到，大家都以爲跟大路走去翻過一個山嶺就是了，心裏所有的滿是未知世界的幻影，剛走上路，便因各人皆急於要爭首功，經過一番爭論以後，結果是隨各人自已去抄近路，一下子，隊伍便分散了。我呢，除開要槍頭，還想多拆點菓子，就商量好同堂哥揀了一條自以爲最近的小路，可是天一黑堂哥就出岔子，不是說有鬼不肯走，就鬧着腿酸走不下去，像是誰害了他一樣，他總是拿前途還不知多遠來慫恿我轉身，但我硬報以冷笑，賭氣獨行，月亮照着我在陰森的途中，一連幾個冷顫，各種困難都發生了，衣不夠啦，肚也餓了，好幾次我差一點要躺下去呌救命了。</p>
<p>幸虧一股希望的力量把我推到一簇李樹林中，彷彿天也亮了，不幸早有一窩人擠着在，掛在枝上的李子實在没有幾顆了，看見那些裝滿了的袋子，我纔想起就是有整堆的李子給我，我也没有地方安置，水知怎地忽然覺得好像有甚麽人騙了我，再望望那羣得意的面孔，我不禁在人叢中器起來了，剛出聲便給一聲「好不怕醜的傢伙」喝醒了。</p>
<p>倘要没有佛洛伊特作怪，我眞要永遠欣賞這種天眞可愛的夢了！就算給局太欠圓滿，但我可以說牠是悲劇，再不然，我還會說好在這是孩子氣，而且明明是一個夢。</p>
<h3>又是點是非</h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>「唯無是非觀」的施蟄存先生其實是極注重是非的，不但此也，他還把本來並不嚴重的事情加以誇張，使之嚴重化。例如「莊子與文選」這問題，在今日本成什麽問題呢？施先生偶而介紹了，豐之餘先生偶而在泛談現狀的一節文章裏提及了，都不算怎麽一回事，人們馬上就全「歸於遺忘」的。可是施先生太注重是非了，竟站出來爲那兩部書「張目」，以爲確是文學青年所當必備的寳書。那麽，别的人也來發表一點是非之見，也是可原諒的罷。事前旣未會盟，目的又不在打倒施先生，幾個人零零落落的一點意見，怎麽算得上「圍剿」？而施先生居然目爲「圍剿」并且說是被有入牢獄了，於是來「越獄」來「突圍」丨自然，這樣纔足以顯得出施先生的英雄。我想，施先生是一定會得到最後的勝利的，因爲問題根本已不成爲問題，自由談的篇幅也太狹，誰還出來擱住施先生的去路呢？</p>
<p>然而，看到「新師說異議」之後，我又忍不住要說幾句話了，這實在很抱歉。我在「一點異議」一文中，說了一句「文壇上的道導制又將恢復起來了」，而施先生在「突圍」中說他並無想做導師的意思，要我「放心」。但即使施先生眞無此意，我還是不能「放心」的。因爲我對於導師制的復活，實有甚深的悲憤，我的悲憤，不專對於施先生個人，而是對於全體想做導師的人，施先生無意做導師，别人的還在想做的。何况，和一唯無是非　」的實際是錨銖必較一樣，不想做　師的實際乃是給文學青年開書目呢丨何况如今又來替「師道」「張目」呢丨</p>
<p>魏猛克先生批評了决瀾社，這「是非」我不能說，但看决瀾社對魏先生深致不滿的，不過是「决瀾社是一　青年藝術學徒所組織的責社」一語，可知决瀾社的「並非欲以師輩前輩資格眩耀……」一語的實際，仍然是「欲以師輩前輩資格」來「眩耀」。否則，　魏先生文者，多數並不知魏先生是决瀾社的門墻桃李，讀了之後，只問他的批評是否正確、更何從斷定他是「輕薄青年」？决瀾社的啓事不從問題的本身上來辯答，只抬出「師道」來壓服魏先生，施先生又出來爲之「張目」，眞可謂氣類相同了，而施先生之擁護導師制眞可謂明目張胆矣。</p>
<p>施先生以爲因思想學說之不同而大學敎授可謝，而啓蒙師不可謝，此其故不可解。施先生旣然看出了魏先生與决瀾社師弟之間的「殊異」，這「殊異」該是「思想學說」上的殊異罷？同是「思想學說之不同」，爲什麽大學敎授可謝，而啓蒙師不可謝？做過中小學的啓蒙師者，竟有這樣的優先權麽？</p>
<p>師生關係，怎樣的因着社會制度而有變遷，不能維持向來性質，這用不到多說。即使魏先生本不該鄙薄其啓蒙師而竟加以鄙薄，那也是魏先生個人之事，决不是「社會中的一個嚴重問題」。施先生把這問題誇張得這樣嚴重，無非因爲他做過别人的啓蒙師，要享一點優先權，而且介紹過作爲青年道德修養之基礎的「顏氏家訓」和「孟子」，要增重這兩部書的價値罷了。</p>
<h3>遊了佛國（續）</h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>兩點鏡光景，朋友留在寺裏睡覺，我一個人去游了佛頂山。這一　路程不算近，差不多要走酸了我的脚。　並不難走，但過了法雨寺不久就走上山了。那許多石級，一層層，一梯一梯，接連不斷，在下面望上去，似乎没有路了，但走完一段，一轉灣馬上又現出新的一段來。我這　走了許久就没有遇見一個同路的人，只偶爾在轉灣處石凳上坐了一個戴斗笠的和尙等着香客來「結緣」，路上是根寂寞的。周圍靜寂得没有聲響。我扶着鐵欄竿不住地登那石級，有時看見路旁有石凳，就在那里歇歇脚。旁邊是山，山上生滿了樹，陽光就照在樹葉上給牠們鍍了一層金色。我只顧往上面走，不知道離海面已經有多高了。有時我回頭看，山坡躺在我的脚下，全被綠樹蓋着，山坡盡處，是一片黄沙。藍色的海水正向着沙灘流過來，海水眞藍得可愛，像一疋緞子，但没有一隻汽船來剪破牠。</p>
<p>雷祖殿過了，海天佛國過了，看見了那兩塊峻險怪特的大石頭，我不知道到山頂還需要走多少路，而且不知道山頂上還有什麽奇怪的東西。但我也只得繼續往上而走去。愈走到上面時，回頭看下面的景緻、那山景也愈顯得美麗了。我彷佛就置身在綠樹叢裏，聽那自然界的微妙的音樂。旁邊有些低的山，上面有些烟霧，我快活地想，雲還在我的下面了。</p>
<p>後來我終於到了　濟寺，這也是一座大廟，但因爲位置在山頂，香客便不多，這時候没有佛事，廟裏靜悄悄的，山門前有幾個和尙在談笑，見着我就換了面容高聲呌起「結緣」來。我没有錢給他們，他們也就笑了，在普陀山靠着「結緣」吃飯的和尙不知道有幾千個，我們在任何地方都可以遇見，有的躺在地上，有的盤脚坐在路旁，有的立在樹蔭下，都伸出手向香客化緣。當他們從我們這裏得不到銅子時，他們就批評說；「朝山進香，不結緣，眞奇怪！」但他們不知道離了普陀山，奇怪的事情還多着呢！</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（十八）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>這是一個夢想者嗎？一個情人嗎？一個哲人嗎，還是一個幸福的人或一個悲哀的人呢？這究竟是什麽人？他走了近去、他懷着好奇心，想要看看這孤　者的臉孔；他認出這人就是他的史弟。</p>
<p>「嚇，是你嗎，哲安？」</p>
<p>「嚇，……筆爾……你跑來這裡幹什麽？」</p>
<p>「我來呼吸點空氣。但你呢？」</p>
<p>哲安笑了起來：</p>
<p>「我也一樣來呼吸一點空氣。」</p>
<p>於是筆爾坐在他的弟弟旁邊。</p>
<p>「你看這景緻不是美麗極了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是啦。」</p>
<p>聽着他的聲音，他便知道哲安什麽都不曾看；他再說道：</p>
<p>「我呢，我每次來到這裏，我便瘋了般的想要遠行，想要跟着這船舶跑去北邊或是南邊。你試想想看，那邊，這些點點的火光都是從世界各處來的呢，從那些有着大花和蒼白的或銅色的美女的國度來的呢，從那些有着蜂雀，象，獅，黑人酋長的國度來的呢，從一切像我們的寓言裏所描寫的那樣的國度來的呢，丨雖然我們已不再相信有「白貓（註一）或「睡林美人」（註二）那樣的事了。假如我們能夠到這些地方去走走，這是多麽開心的事啊；可是這事要有一些錢才行，要有許多錢……</p>
<p>他突焀停住不說了，他心想他的兄弟現在已有錢了，並且他有了錢，什麽都不必憂慮，他不必每天工作，他自由自在，毫無拘束，他幸福，快樂，他可以隨意到什麽地方去頑，他可以去親近那些長着金髮的瑞典佳人或是古巴就城的黑髮美女。</p>

<h3>弱小民族的一條血路</h3>
<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>前幾天，受着朋友們的慫恿一同去瞧「熱血雄心」，出來後，我悵悵了好幾日；直到昨天讀了賓符君的「戰爭的怒號」我的心才像被什麽東西撬開一樣，我感覺到那可怕的場面丨戰事丨的確已在向我們的眼前逐漸的展開了。我的腦中似電光火石般的一閃，接着便馬上黑暗起來，這黑暗像一塊重石　住了我的心，而我却還在本能的想，「我們應該怎樣來抵抗這一次不可遏止的大戰的侵略與蹂躪呢」？</p>
<p>當然，我不是一個戰爭的歌頌者，我更不是一個想借戰爭爲進階的野心者，我與一般普通的人們同樣地厭惡戰爭，第二次大戰之將降臨是我深深地所咒詛而認爲不幸的，戰爭給予我們的印象實在是太慘酷了。眞的，戰爭於我們大衆又有什麽好處呢？戰爭誠然是一個偉大的權威者，它能夠在一時三刻之間殺死幾百幾千甚至幾萬個的有生命的動物如人之踏死一羣螞蟻一樣；然而，正因爲這個偉大無匹的權威，反而不只過使得我們對於它多增加些厭惡及慘厲的觀念而已。</p>
<p>可是，這一次的世界大戰，我以爲我們應該以熱烈的鮮血來歡迎它；雖然我說過戰爭是一個最可恐怖的惡魔，但是，它究竟是死的，無生命的，使用之權却依舊操在我們的手裏：君不見夫「水與火」，水能灌漑田地，維養人之生命，火能燒煑食物，發光取熱；然而有時也有水災或火災；關於戰爭我以爲也是一樣。歷史已明明在告訴我們：華盛頓的爭取自由獨立之戰，林肯的南北之戰，都已獲得了民族上人道上至高的榮光；我們能下意識地說我們現在受列强的侵襲與壓迫尙不如華盛頓時代之美國或林肯時代之黑人麽？</p>
<p>唉！我眞想跳上那最高的山峯撞起那最大的驚鐘來告訴我的國人們那比洪水還厲害還可怕的危機已將臨到我們的頭上了！這世界第二次的大戰，不啻便是一個「强存弱敗」的最後判决，我們將怎樣在這一個全世界的虎狼大聚會中掙扎我們最後的命運呢丨丨成功仰或失敗？同胞們，不要以爲「九一八」的戰事已經停，要知道這正是一件更大的戰事的開始。在目前包界上每一個國家差不多都在積極地增加他們的軍力狀况之下，我回頭看一看我們的中國，我禁不住心急如焚，淚落如雨：我們的土地是日蹙，我們的人心是日離，我們的同胞們更是日漸麻醉頽廢！啊！朋友們，别再像吃醉了酒一般的專門想睡了！看看前途的彌漫的荆棘罷，聽聽那隱藏着將發的嚵獸的咆哮聲罷！時代已不再是狐疑不决的時候了，我們必須即速舊發起我們祖宗們固有的英勇無畏的精神來；假使我們再要戀戀不捨那粉紅色的夢，世界大戰將在你的迷夢中爆發了。我們難道要永遠埋葬在荆棘堆裏，我們難道便是這樣無聲無嗅的滅亡麽？我的親愛的同胞們，讓我們一同牽着手起來吧，讓我們一同齊着心前進！我們没有你我　也没有彼此，我們將怎樣雪去我們以往的恥辱，我們將怎樣在這帝國主義者猙獰的面目中替我們自已，替一般弱小的民族殺開一條血路？我相信：弱小民族的出路只有一條，那便是一條以熱血來凝結成的路；我更相信；羣衆的力量是能夠打倒那專以武力來征歷壓迫别個弱小民族的惡魔的。奮鬥罷！這正時候了，第二次世界大戰將爲我們解决一切丨丨成功抑或失敗？</p>
<h3>爲「談職業」一文答之君底「服務至上主義」</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>前天讀了之君對我三日的談言「談職業」所發的「服務至上主義」，他是那麽盛氣凌人，不可嚮邇，本想默爾而息，是非曲直，自有賢明讀者的公判。但爲了要探索這問題的究竟，不由得此刻我又拏起了筆桿。</p>
<p>之君大文，除了其中有一整段及不少零磅的句子毫無關涉的對我漫駡而外，其餘就是以當前的畸形現象，證明他的「爲吃飯而職業」「職業是以謀獲生活資料所發生的行爲「對象僅是經濟」的職業觀，純粹以畸形事實，來推翻我那篇的理論，却又　未指出我的理論上的錯誤。</p>
<p>如果我們僅僅着眼於現社會的畸形事實，停滯於現階段上，斤斤立論，那　之君的賢　　論，我也俯首拜服！不過事　絶不會這樣簡括，理論絶不會這樣單純，之君就因爲不曾展望到這些，　以行文就犯了意氣的宣洩，論列也就那麽武斷激偏。</p>
<p>我不但認清了現社會的畸形，矛盾，而且曳認定職業已成了絶大的問題，没有職業可談，事實上簡直找不到職業。我那文首尾都這樣寫着：「在農村經濟枯萎都會市况蕭條的雙重尖銳化的現在，與此息息相關的職業，也早已相隨成了絶大的問題，多少人連年在職業的圈子外兜轉，終是無業可謀，無職可就，形成流浪飢餓的大衆失業的恐慌，這還有什麽職業可談」？「歸根一句現在要圖謀職業，眞是困難極了，除了有「拍」「吹」的素養，而又有勢力做後盾」。可是人類是前進的，奮鬥的，探索光明的，我們就眞甘於停駐在這畸形的死亡的現階段上麽？因爲我曾作過如上的申明，就顯然我那是在作正確理論的闡述，是我們所希冀的新階段上的職業，在理論上職業的解釋當然如此：「職業是人類的一種必然與必需的生活活動，其行　爲解决生活，促進人類社會」，對人類應敬奉職業則是這樣說：一人類的意義，一是生，一是怎樣才能生，因爲要生，就需要衣食住的供養，因爲要衣食住的供養，就需要生活活動，……時至今日，固有不少的人，憑藉私有制度，……不活動也能優裕的生活。但這顯然是人類意義的歪曲，病態的社會現象，其崩坍是必然在不久的將來就會到臨的，所以人類應該有職業」。再談到職業與人生關係的密切；「必有着長久性，而且是每日如影隨形般的緊挨着生活前進」。所以擇業就須顧及到那三個條件，然後「必然是人才適然織業，戰業適當人才」，那就應「敬樂恒」，之君並未指出我的理論上的差謬，到底那些地方不對。旣理無論差謬，之君就應認清我那篇文章，是探索光明的，是跨過這畸形的現階段，而是針對着我們所希求的社會與合理的職業而立論。敢問在我們所理想的社會裏的理想職業是不是應這樣？光明是接着黑暗，理想是接着現實，現在我們雖在黑暗的現實裏滾，也就迫切的需要滾進光明的理想裏去。</p>
<p>之君也許會這樣問：理論不能離開事實，牠們是一家的，可是有些理論就不是這樣死板，而是倡導出新的事實的，正如我們現在鼓吹合理的新社會的實現，大家都應有飯吃，這是誰都承認的理論，之君可說這不切現在的事實，是欺騙，而以現在大家都在被剥削，挨餓的事實來推翻麽？推翻得到麽？</p>
<p>現社會的諸畸形矛盾，誰不公認，但我們果眞這樣倒霉，老停滯於這死亡的階段上麽？之君，人類是探索光明的，我們是企求合理的職業的呵！</p>
<p>辱承之君旣寵錫我以「作家」高帽，愧不敢當，謹此奉趙·復蒙這樣抬舉：　　「於是我乃開始推測這位作家一定是開了三十塊錢一天的房間而寫這篇大文章的，至少也當然是洋房三層樓上朝南窗子的主　丨不然，該是何以會如此其像　着薄荷香糖，吐出氣來香嘖嘖的而怪覺得腦袋子風凉清爽呢？」我差不多　到爛熟，（借用之君語）乃亦學着推測之君一定是過來人，是經騐之談，不然决描繪不出這樣親切！而我自已則感到受寵若驚，深得精神上的安慰，並增進一分智識，知道上海有三十元一天的房間，我竟旣承之君推進去住了一天，裏面那麽舒服，於是遂濡筆而爲本刊寫一篇「談言」，撈回這一天的房租的十分之一，而且開了房間轉來，又是洋房樓主，幸甚幸甚。不過事實頗有不符，不瞞之君說，我因爲擺脫不了家庭的各種負擔，我只有住在戰區又是貪民窟的一個中客堂裏，而且是與友人合住，前有前客堂（就天井搭成的）後有後客堂，我住在當中，是四面板壁不通風，夜夜遲眠捉臭蟲，我曾做了一箱「一年没有吸空氣了」的自我生活寫實，終感於是自已的低能醜行，不敢發出，就把　斯了，現在我滿擬攀駕，如之君有睱，很有機會請過來白相白相，一觀實情，那時說不定促膝談起心來，會同道一聲；「我們都是被榨得乾了的人呵丨」（冒昩說句我們　想之君生活當不如此尴尬也）</p>
<p>最後，我是一個虚懷的小子，以後之君苦以嚴正的態度，不吝頻錫督勉，那是我所最企仰與感激的。</p>
<h3>阿金姐</h3>
<p>— 齊</p>
<p>不到一年之間，阿金姐的生活却經過了農工「商」丨丨她自已也莫明其妙的三大變化。</p>
<p>她　在故鄕（離泗陽縣城十八里的王家集）當半牛馬式的童養媳。去年七月間淮河的决堤，就把她婆家裏早已難以維持的貧農生活，宣告了死刑。幾畝不夠養活一家人的田地，變成了魚鼈蝦蟹的（臨時公館），原來就不蔽風雨的兩間破屋，只乘了三分之一，浮現在一望無際的濁流裏。這樣一個「老天爺」所賜與的災禍，使阿金姐莊稼人的生活，從此完結，婆家而　人都　在　餓線下　只有各　東西也流散。公公對人家說了許多的好話，纔由一個輪船上的老伙</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>夫只取了一元的代價，把阿金用「蓋黄魚」的方法，帶到上海來，一線的希望是託一個當娘姨的姑媽替她找「事」丨丨</p>
<p>不論工錢多少，只要有飯吃的事。</p>
<p>最先，由他姑媽擔保着到薦頭行裏找僱主，阿金姐就也擠在一大堆老少不一的陌生的女人中間坐在薦頭行門口等「生意」，過了幾天，她被送到一個三口之家的家庭裏當「小大姐」。每天很機械地做着倒痰盂，打尿布和洗衣裳，打地板……等工作。有一天，領着小少爺在客堂裏白相，「少爺」回來了，看到客堂裏没有别人，竟在阿金姐胸部隆起的小墳墓上「自由行動」了一番，弄得她臉發燒，心跳了大半天，在迷惘中又感到有些輕飄，她有些怕，但又像有一種東西在血管裏作怪，她彷彿又有些希望那可怕的一幕的再現。但是，等到她只做了二十幾天時，「少奶奶」却宣告「這隻「小妖精」弗會做生活」，還是請年紀大些的娘姨好！於是，阿金姐的「小大姐」生活，又告結束。工錢呢，在試工第三天稱工錢」的時候，早已被薦頭行和姑媽「四六對分」了，她只在臨走時，領得了少奶奶四隻八開的「酒錢」。</p>
<p>過了十幾天半飽半餓的生活，聽了姑媽許多的詛咒和埋怨，命運之神又把阿金姐拖到楊樹浦一家紗廠裏。</p>
<p>在「揀花間」裏工作着。雖然已是深秋，但廠裏還是經常閉着燠熱的空氣，灰塵，棉花絮和許多看不見的小纎維，拌雜在空氣之中，不但向她和每個工人的鼻孔，喉管，肺部侵入着，閉在洋鐵罐子裏的冷飯，被燠熱的空氣薰蒸得發酵，到中午拿來吃時，十回有八回是帶了蘇味，而且灰黑色的塵沙和纎維，像「肉鬆」似的舖滿了飯面上，她一面咬着牙把這種「兩脚機器」的「煤炭」很命地往口裏硬塞，一面心裏在想想上海灘的「飯」，並不見得怎樣比家鄕玉蜀黍煑的稀粥好吃呢。</p>
<p>她看見工頭和員司們對於生得比較漂亮一點的女工互相「打浜」，有時並伸手動脚的，她經過了解釋，纔懂得把手在女工的臉上一摸，名呌「吃荳腐」。當這些「聲片」映到她的眼簾時，她回憶起了當「小大姐」時「少爺」對於她胸部所幹的一番動作，她惘然如有所失，一種自脚跟上透頂門的熱力，圍繞在她的血管經絡裏，很强烈地燃燒着，這時的阿金姐，纔開始覺得除了做工，吃飯，穿衣而外，她還有其他的需要！</p>
<p>在不斷的耳濡目染和生理的緊張之下，阿金姐也學習着同男工們或馬路上跟着「釘梢」的白相人嘻笑怒駡地「打浜」，而幾番「打浜」之後，命運又在她生命史上，做了一個事實的結論：被一個「打浜」過幾次的男子勸去開房間。</p>
<p>那人在經過幾次的滿足之後，就花言巧語地同阿金姐商量：工廠裏的生活嘸啥做頭，到游藝場去當「女招待」。不久，這種宣傳成了事實，阿金姐又抛了工人生活，展開了别有風味的「女招待」的生活。同她開房間的男子由「長遠不來」而漸至絶跡，不過經過游藝塲一番「社會敎育」的阿金姐，却並不感到有「失戀」那一回事，她只覺得那人「太嘸良心」，她又自爲安慰：「男人家終歸是良心好的少」。結果，她爲了精神物質的需要，就開始了「生張熟魏。來者不拒」的生活，她似乎已經由「工」而「商」了。</p>
<p>在「公共汽車」式的生活之下，一種她看不見，說不出名目的病菌由許多「無名氏」的男子的身上，侵入了她的血管和肉體。那些小動物與日俱增地蕃殖着，阿金姐已經由骨痛，眼紅，手心發燒而達到最後的階段，她的臉上和頸項之間，終於帶起「彩」來了！游藝的主任馬上變成鐵青的面孔，呌她：「識相一點，自家再找别樣生意」！</p>
<p>很迷惘而悲切地在馬路上徘徊着，想去找姑媽，但是又怕「嘸面孔見人」。從家裏遭水荒起，到她的「小大姐」被斥退，她早已覺得人們所走的「路」，對於她是越走越窄，看去只剩一條線，而現在，竟是一條線也看不見，成爲黑漆的一片了。</p>
<h3>把戲</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>這也許是一個千眞萬確的定理；女同學總是坐在最前一排的。因此，女同學不會發現男同學做的把戲。</p>
<p>最會胡鬧的平湊巧坐在第二排，因此他常常在課後向同學報告某女士的雪花粉塗得厚，某女士的頭髮燙得好，還有其他的消息。平是不會注意到先生的講解的，他最歡喜替女同學們畫速寫圖。</p>
<p>有一次，他又把坐在前面的同學的背影畫在拍紙簿上。坐在他旁邊的陳說他畫得不錯。於是平又在畫的旁邊添了一個陳的速寫，上面寫着：「敬祝成功」。</p>
<p>陳笑了一笑，把那張畫奪了過來夾在書裏。</p>
<p>於是平又繼續畫别一個。陳輕輕地</p>
<h3>現代名人書畫</h3>
<p>况又韓先生山水况又韓，别字苕民，廣西臨桂人，爲故詞宗蕙風先生子，工倚聲，善寫山水。</p>
<p>說：「假如你想出一個把戲來使男同學都笑的話，三塊鷄蛋糕，一杯牛奶。」</p>
<p>平答應了。他在拍紙簿上寫了幾個字，把那張紙輕輕地掛在那位坐在前面的女同學的領上。於是陳笑了，爲了陳的笑聲，全課堂的同學都把眼光射到那女同學的背後。</p>
<p>在那紙上寫着四個字：「我愛阿六」！大家都笑了，因爲阿陸是校中的一個小廚子，長得怪可怕的。</p>
<p>女同學不知道是什麽事，没回過頭來，一直到下班，女同學還帶着那張紙望閱報室跑，於是笑聲更大了！</p>
<p>平笑迷迷地咬着鷄蛋糕，陳豎起了大拇指向他道：「媽的，眞有你的！」</p>
<h3>哭什麽！</h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>哭，眞是最討厭的事情。通常，孩子們哭了，我就打；越扛越哭，越哭越打，要打得他們不敢再哭，不能再哭！使其哭失掉作用。</p>
<p>聽人說：哭是一種「傷心」的表　；但我承認；哭是内心「無辦法」的舉露。所以哭，絶端是「示弱」，也就是懦弱，無　，甚至是衰老，没落的徵象！一個有志願，有主張，有勇，有能的不斷向前努力的人，他（或她）會在偶然碰壁的時候，便出之以「哭」的麽？</p>
<p>有人焉，家爲盜刦，屋被火燒，父母妻子復遭賊子所戮。這時，他不運用自已向强盜去算帳，而只是躺在大路之旁一味的痴哭，逢着人，又是拚命的哭！像這扔了性命的哭法，當眞把自已哭死了，送丢了的一切，還會重爲他所有麽？最多，換得路人的一些不相干的所謂同情罷了。假使，我心裏想，這傢伙竟哭到我面前來的時候，我必得先狠命地咒他一聲：「没出息的東西！」接上去就打！眞的，會哭的人，只有以打對之！要打得他不敢再哭，不能再哭！最後，要他知道「哭」之没用，并且是傻，是</p>

<p>痴。</p>
<p>一塲嘻嘻哈哈，熱熱鬧鬧的「全國運動大會」閉幕了，聽說，當選手們都牙張口開地領到了亮晶晶的銀盃金戈之類的時候，居然也有人哭了一塲。據南京二十三日電：遼游永四傑史興隆史興駡史興陸史瑞聲，以全運會閉幕後，各處健兒含「笑」而歸，獨渠等有家歸不得，雖得錦標，亦徒望錦標對「泣」……爲喚醒國人收復失地……。這一泣，雖然没有哇的一聲哭出聲來，觀其沉痛之語，亦大有痛器一塲的勢子。在史君們，未來的事變？又要爲難了中間人</p>
<p>這動作，固然是極有意義的，發人深省的，而傷心善哭哭的中國人看見這樣子，鼻酸而涕泗滂沱者，自然是大有其人而外，恐怕不致還會有比較實際些的其他吧！所以，這裏，我願意告訴史君們：這一衰老耳聾的民族，你雖然哭成了個淚人兒，它也是没有感覺的，而且，你們的哭，至少是需弱没出息的表現！假使以你們的處境，眞正的明白了自已的大任而需要發洩一下的時候，哭什麽？你們還把大任肩在自已的肩膊上踏着實地去幹！至少，把帳向敵人算清楚。不然，你們老是成天的哭哭啼啼地把淚珠兒掛着，這是快要屬於被打之一羣的</p>

<h3>父債的責任</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一爿工廠裏的小職員，每月薪水是十幾塊錢。在民國十九年八月裏的時候，我父親因爲我兩個哥哥，都不上進，况且染有烟癖，所以將房産作四份分了，我兄弟四人，各得一份。父親負的債，也同時作三份分了，我父親自負一份，我兩個哥哥，各負一份。我同弟弟，因爲年紀尙幼，况且没有自立的可能，所以債没有分到。不料今年正月裏，我的父親病死了。現在我兩個哥哥，仍舊同前頭一樣的不上進，不要說呌他還債，自顧尙且不週，所以各債權人，都向我來討。先生，我賺了十幾塊錢的薪水，除了瞻養年老的母親和幼年的弟弟之外，那裏還有錢來還債呢？眞使我爲難極了！先生，我現在將我父親遺下的一份債，歸我來慢慢的理楚，還有我兩個哥哥的兩份債，照現在的法律，可以不關嗎？先生，你是黑暗的明燈，青年的南針，請你不吝金玉，指敎我這可憐虫。敬祝</p>

<p>編者按：這件事的解决，其關鍵全視分家的時候，有没有用合法手續，通知債權人，而得其同意。如其當時並未通知，或雖通知而並未徵得同意；那末按照民法請伸，一個人的遺債，應由其繼承人連帶負責。這樣講來，兩位令兄旣無力償付，你就有担任全部債務的責任。如其當時各債權人有過同意的表示，並且還分析清楚，各别承頂，那末這種債，在法律的立塲上看來，已經移轉爲二位令兄與尊大人三個人的債了。現在尊大人去世，你能把他的一份，承認下來，已算是極講情理的了。</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平（六二）（四幕劇）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>第四幕　往何處去？第二塲</p>
<p>兵甲：來了，在剪鐵絲網了。</p>
<p>（我軍以步槍和機關槍開始射擊。約二分鐘，敵軍開始自山上奔下來，躍進戰　。死，殭臥仆地。但因衆寡不敵，義軍敗退，放棄戰壕，敵軍乘勝追擊。敵軍佔領戰塲。戰壕　時沉寂。少傾，義軍反攻，殺聲震天，自遠而近。義軍自臺右逼近戰壕。死亡枕藉。不久，舞臺沉寂，祇聞傷者的哀號。我軍收拾死屍，見日兵未死者乃以槍剌死，陸續將死屍運出戰壕。義軍多疲倦過甚，藉地休息。</p>
<p>兵丁：（見兵甲）喂，好傢伙，你還没有死麽？</p>
<p>兵甲：可不是，你也没有死！</p>

<h3>The Bandits of Funing Refuse to Surrender, Security Forces Attack the City; Over 500 Bandits Flee from the South Gate, Driven Back by Security Forces; Zhang Xiguang's Representative Sent into the City Wounded by Bandits</h3>
<p>Changli: After Zhang Xiguang arrived at the front two days ago, he sent personnel into the city to make a final劝告 (quàngào: persuade) to the bandits. The bandits remained stubborn, refusing to surrender, and wounded our representative who entered the city. We then decided to attack at dawn. Unexpectedly, over 500 bandits fled from the South Gate at 3 a.m. on the third day, and were met with a fierce attack by us. Intense fighting ensued between the two sides. Our artillery also joined the battle, killing many fleeing bandits at the South Gate. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city. From 3 a.m. to 10 a.m., gunfire and cannon fire did not cease. Qi Wenping and someone else emerged to negotiate surrender, but because the bandits' attitude remained cunning, we have not yet responded. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): There are currently over 2,000 remnant bandits inside Funing City, none of whom have combat experience. Their ammunition and supplies are mostly exhausted, so they are extremely panicked. However, the Han traitors (漢奸) in the city, fearing the loss of protection after the bandits surrender, are instigating the bandits to resist stubbornly, attempting to prolong the situation temporarily. Our security forces have completely and tightly surrounded the four gates (East, South, West, and North) of Funing City. The front lines are only about fifty meters away from the bandits. Therefore, once the general attack order is given, Funing City can be recovered immediately. Mo Guilin's bandit gang of seven or eight hundred people has fled to Yanqing, Yushu, and 濼女. The bandit 小老鵰 (Xiǎo Lǎo Diāo: "Little Eagle Owl," presumably a bandit name) has also joined. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin): The Provincial Government still hopes that the bandits in 濼東 will realize their error and surrender. For each rifle, thirty yuan will be given; for each light machine gun, one hundred yuan will be given; for each heavy machine gun, one hundred and fifty yuan will be given; and for each mortar, two hundred yuan. On the evening of the second day, a general attack on Funing City was not launched, giving the bandits a final opportunity to consider. However, 老耗子 ("Old Mouse," presumably a bandit name)'s attitude is arrogant, and the 3,000 bandits inside the city are determined not to surrender. Zhang Xiguang, the commander-in-chief of the security forces, ordered the city to be attacked on the morning of the third day. There were no reports of the situation as of the evening of the third day. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin): The administrative inspector's office of the Ji-Mi (薊密) district and the 濼榆 district each received 5,000 yuan for establishment expenses, which have been issued by the Finance Department. The public office expenses are 800 yuan per month, and the provincial government has agreed to increase it to 1,100 yuan. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Sheng Shicai Encircles Ma Zhongying's Troops</h3>
<p>(Beiping): A dispatch from Dihua states that Sheng Shicai has taken a large encirclement formation against the remnant troops of Ma Zhongying. Ma is using the militia to attempt to resist stubbornly. Heavy fighting is still ongoing near Hami. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Mongolians in Beiping Telegraph a Request to Accommodate All-Mongolian Suggestions, Claiming Autonomy Has No Background</h3>
<p>(Beiping): The Mongolian Association of Fellow Provincials in Beiping telegraphed the Central Government on the first day, claiming that Inner Mongolian autonomy has no background. They hope to accommodate all-Mongolian suggestions, promote the entire public opinion organ, and telegraph the high-ranking officials going north to carefully select and promptly establish a grand border plan to avoid unexpected future disputes. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): The representatives of the Mongolian Association of Fellow Provincials in Beiping, 吉爾格朗 (Jí'ěrgélǎng) and others, telegraphed Beiping, stating that another meeting will be held at Bailingmiao, with a broader scope of discussion and unanimous opinions among the representatives. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Mongol Banners Repeatedly Urge Departure, Huang and Zhao Prepare Cars for Departure; Entourage to Depart Separately Within Days to Conduct Investigations in Various Leagues and Banners; Huang Telegraphs to Hire Livestock Specialists to Assist in Inspection</h3>
<p>Guihua: Huang and Zhao received a joint telegram on the first day from Yun Duanwangchuke (雲端旺楚克) and others in Bailingmiao, welcoming them. Huang and Zhao replied on the second day, saying that they have prepared vehicles and will depart immediately. Huang and Zhao's entourage plan to depart separately to various leagues and banners within days to conduct practical investigations. The supplies to be used en route were originally scheduled to be transported to Bailingmiao on the third day, but due to unfinished vehicle repairs, they will be transported on the fourth day. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Guihua: Here, regarding the Inner Mongolia issue, evaluations are based on facts, and optimistic views are generally held, believing that it is not difficult to resolve. However, how to reform Mongolian politics is being carefully studied and jointly discussed. The Sui Provincial Government has been receiving letters, telegrams, and official documents from various league banners' princes and representatives, forwarded by Bailingmiao. The content consistently expresses obedience to the central and local authorities. The Sui Provincial Government has made copies of this proof and intends to publish it in a short period to clarify the truth about the autonomy movement. The Provincial Government does not want to express opinions on the Inner Mongolia issue and will leave it to the Central Government to handle fully. Huang convened a meeting, saying that the officials still deny it. Because Inner Mongolia's livestock industry is extremely important, Huang specially telegraphed to hire livestock expert Gu Qianji (顧謙吉) from Beiping to Suiyuan to investigate in Inner Mongolia, and also telegraphed to the Ministry of Interior's Health Department in Nanjing to quickly send veterinarians specializing in manufacturing serum to Suiyuan. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): The behind-the-scenes of Inner Mongolian autonomy are complex. Mongolians demand the return of Mongolian land to Mongolians. In fact, Mongolian land has been divided and归(guī: belong) to the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, and a portion has been changed to counties. If as the Mongolians request, the disputes would be quite significant. The Central Government will provide assistance to Mongolian affairs within a possible range. If there are excessive conflicts, it will be difficult to allow. The borders of Chahar and Suiyuan Provinces were slightly changed during Yan Xishan's administration of North China. The Left 旗 (qí: banner) originally belonging to Chahar was划(huà: divide) to Suiyuan and changed to five counties: Taolin, Liangcheng, Fengzhen, Xinghe, and Jining. The ten counties of Koubei Dao in Hebei Province were划 (huà: divide) to Chahar Province. After the reform, Mongolians felt quite inconvenienced due to tax issues and strongly sought to restore the original system. This time, Huang and Zhao were ordered to go north, and this matter was originally intended to be discussed and handled by the authorities of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, but it was temporarily abandoned due to certain reasons. Huang and Zhao plan to meet with Yan Xishan to exchange opinions. The date of their departure to Mongolia has not yet been determined. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Bao Yueqing (包悅卿), the representative of Prince De, spoke, saying that he reported to He Yingqin yesterday on the reasons for implementing autonomy in Inner Mongolia and the proceedings of the Bailingmiao Conference. He stated that after the Central Government's inspection commissioners Huang and Zhao arrive in Mongolia, he hopes that the Mongolian princes will stand on the Central Government's standpoint, be open and honest, and discuss in detail to solve the autonomy problem using appropriate methods, hoping that all ethnic groups in the country will unite to resist foreign invasion. Inner Mongolian autonomy must seek the true welfare of the Mongolian people in the future. He also gave a handwritten letter to Prince De, which I (余) carried back. Yesterday, I received a telegram from 平 (Píng: short for Beiping) from Ka Yingdalai (卡英達賴), the representative of Xilingol League, urging me to return from Bailingmiao. I will leave 平 (Píng: short for Beiping) the day after tomorrow, first go to Suiyuan to visit Huang, and then return to Bailingmiao to report back. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing): A certain important official of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said: (1) Huang and Zhao arrived in Suiyuan on the 31st, and are currently discussing with Chairman Fu the methods for dealing with Mongolian affairs, and have sent Li Songfeng and Kong Qingzong to Bailingmiao to inspect the situation first. Therefore, the date of Huang and Zhao's departure to Mongolia will be determined after Li and Kong return to Suiyuan and report. There have also been reports that Prince De and others are demanding the organization of an autonomous government and want to劃(huà: designate) a large portion of the territory within the borders of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces as an autonomous region. However, we have not yet received detailed telegram reports from Huang and Zhao about the truth, so it is extremely difficult to judge. However, the Central Government has long determined the policy for Mongolian affairs, among which the most important point is that Mongolian autonomy should be based on the principle of not destroying the original administrative regions and administrative systems. If the demands of the Mongolian princes exceed the scope stipulated by the Central Government, it will be difficult to adopt. If one does not consider the environment and sings high-sounding tunes, it will not only be useless, but will instead give foreign powers an opportunity to exploit. (2) Shi Qingyang (石青陽) had this suggestion when the Central Legislation and Regulations Consolidation Committee was established regarding the proposal to change the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission into a ministry. Before the Central Government formally decided on matters relating to border affairs, it was not convenient to disclose them in advance, so very few outsiders knew about it. Recently, the content of Minister Huang's proposal to change it into a ministry is no different from Shi's proposal, but the names are slightly different. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops at Various Great Wall Passes Prepare for Winter; Chaiyama Discusses the Process of Crossing the Border, Saying the Diplomatic Future is Optimistic; Okamura Scheduled to Arrive in Beiping on the 6th to Negotiate with North China Authorities</h3>
<p>(Beiping): Japanese military officer Chaiyama (柴山) visited He Yingqin today to convey the opinions of the Kwantung Army regarding the war zone and eastern Chahar. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Chaiyama stated that after I flew to Changchun last time, Commander Hishikari (菱刈) of the Kwantung Army had gone to Lushun, so I met with Chief of Staff Isoya (小磯). The result was satisfactory. On October 31st, I left Changchun by plane to Shenyang, staying for one day. It happened that Takayoshi Matsumuro (松室孝良), the chief of the special affairs agency in Chengde, was in Shenyang, so I met with him. On the first of this month, I flew back to Chengde and met with Lieutenant General Nishi Yoshiichi (西義一), the commander of the Eighth Division. On the morning of the second day, I flew to Ping. This time I went to Changchun to negotiate two matters: (1) the war zone incident; (2) the defense of eastern Chahar. After negotiating with the Kwantung side, the results were satisfactory. The Kwantung Army is quite understanding of the North China authorities. If there is sincerity, everything can have good results. I am extremely optimistic about the future of China and Japan after my return this time. Japanese troops are gradually withdrawing from various passes of the Great Wall. Currently, only the Yumenguan and Gubeikou passes and Saha Bridge (撒河橋) within Xifengkou still have a small number of Japanese troops stationed there. Because there are no villages outside the above-mentioned locations, they are temporarily borrowing 民房 (mínháng: civilian houses) within the passes. The Tanggu Truce (塘沽協定) stipulated that the two sides would use the north and south of the Great Wall as the boundary. After negotiations have results, the Japanese troops will naturally withdraw entirely to the north of the Great Wall. The joint transportation on the Beining and Fengshan railways is the responsibility of the diplomats of the embassy, and I do not know the details. Relations between Japan and Russia are quite tense on the border between Russia and Manchuria, but not as exaggerated as the outside world reports. Ambassador Ariyoshi is in Ping and is scheduled to stay for several days. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Okamura telegraphed Ping, stating that he is scheduled to arrive in Ping by plane from Changchun on the 6th to negotiate with our authorities on the handover of various passes of the Great Wall. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Chaiyama stated that due to the cold weather, there are not many barracks for the troops stationed outside the关(guān: pass). In addition to rushing to build barracks, the Kwantung Army currently stationed at and south of various passes of the Great Wall will temporarily spend the winter in the original location. At the latest by next spring, the Kwantung Army can completely withdraw to outside the关(guān: pass). Regarding the bandit suppression in 濼東, the heavy weapons of the Chinese troops have been transported to the front line, and it is expected that the bandit trouble can be resolved soon. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): A Japanese army attaché released a statement this morning denying the news of the Japanese army withdrawing from the Great Wall. The statement roughly stated that the Japanese authorities have decided to completely withdraw the Japanese troops in the demilitarized zone, and this move has already begun and will be completed within one or two days. The Japanese army will retreat to places such as Gubeikou, but will never abandon the Great Wall. The Japanese army will occupy various key points. The Japanese army attaché continued to say that Japan does not have suitable military camps in the Rehe area, so it is currently unable to withdraw from various passes of the Great Wall, but there may be a possibility of withdrawing next spring. It is heard that this measure is the result of negotiations between the Chinese military authorities here and the Kwantung Army. A part of the Japanese army can therefore be transferred to other places in Manchuria. It is said that at least one division can be transferred out. It is heard that a part of a certain brigade has already been transferred away from Gubeikou. (Reuters Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Liu-Tang War Ceases; Qin Dechun Visits He to Seek Instructions</h3>
<p>(Beiping): Regarding the Liu-Tang conflict, the Military Sub-Committee has ordered Song to investigate. Qin Dechun visited He today to seek instructions. After obtaining appropriate measures, Qin will return to Zhangjiakou and begin handling the matter. It is heard that the Liu-Tang war has now ceased. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>North China War Zone Relief Society: Three Relief Measures</h3>
<p>(Beiping): The North China War Zone Relief Committee is actively handling three items: emergency relief, work relief, and agricultural relief. Emergency relief has been mostly completed. The Department of Reconstruction of Hebei Province is drafting a work relief plan. Because the war zone relief public bond regulations have not yet been promulgated, the loan will be temporarily挪用 (nuóyòng: divert) from the emergency relief savings. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Economic Committee to Establish Beiping Branch</h3>
<p>(Beiping): The Economic Committee has decided to establish a branch in Ping and will appoint Wang Kemin as chairman, Zhou Zuomin, Zhang Zitan, and Li Qin as members. It can be submitted for decision and announcement at the next administrative meeting. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Yin Rugeng Goes to Yumenguan to Discuss Bandit Suppression and Traffic Issues</h3>
<p>(Beiping): Yin Rugeng went to Yumenguan last night with two people from the Japanese embassy, including military officer Nemoto, to negotiate with the Japanese side on bandit suppression in 濼東 and the通車 (tōngchē: through traffic) of the Beining Railway and the pseudo-Fengshan Railway. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi Tours the Great Wall</h3>
<p>(Beiping): Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi toured the Great Wall with Shi Qiao this morning. The Public Security Bureau sent police to accompany and protect them. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi is scheduled to host a farewell banquet for British Ambassador Lampson at the Japanese embassy on the evening of the 5th and has invited military and political dignitaries from our side to accompany him. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping): Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi is scheduled to leave Ping around the 16th to return to Shanghai, and will return to his country from Shanghai soon. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Xu Yuanquan Telegraphs that He Bandit Gang is Disintegrating Internally</h3>
<p>(Hankou): Xu Yuanquan telegraphed on the third day that the He bandit gang is killing each other internally. Bandit leaders such as Duan Dechang, Duan Yulin, Wang Bingnan, Ye Guangji, and Chen Peiyin have been killed one after another, and the momentum has disintegrated. It can be cleaned up in the short term. (Special Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Ma Hongbin Arrives in Lanzhou by Air</h3>
<p>(Xi'an): A telegram from Lanzhou on the second day stated that Ma Hongbin flew from Luoyang to Lanzhou on the first day and had some contacts with the Gansu military and political authorities before returning to Ningwu. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Xi'an): Ren Wenyuan, the representative of Ma Hongkui, came to the province from Ningxia on the second day to visit Shao Lizi and Yang Hucheng for some contacts. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<h3>The Road Ahead for Inner Mongolian Autonomy and North China's Economy</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The brewing of the demand for autonomy by various leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia has not been a matter of a single day. However, most princes are content with their lot and do not want to cause trouble. The political level of the general Mongolian people is also very low, and their political demands are not very enthusiastic. Therefore, no excessive practical actions have been seen to date. If we look at the telegram requesting autonomy, led by Prince De, the deputy leader of the Xilingol League, we find that the reasons are very weak and not without discrepancies with practical issues. Prince De's職司 (zhísī: official duty) is only the deputy leader of the Xilingol League, and his爵位 (juéwèi: noble rank) is only a Prince of the Second Rank. It is insufficient for him to lead the Inner Mongolian autonomy in terms of appealing to the old princes, and the Mongolian youth on the new side are even more unwilling to be led by him. Therefore, although the so-called autonomy conference has been held repeatedly, there are still no definite results. In principle, Inner and Outer Mongolia and the inland provinces have differences in language and writing, and the socio-economic structures are very different. Nomadic economy and agricultural economy have historically had interconnected places, but the differences in production relations are particularly significant. The upper-level politics are difficult to manage in one furnace. Then, the demand for autonomy in Inner Mongolia is almost inevitable.</p>
<p>However, because of the loss of the Eastern Provinces (Dong Provinces: Manchuria) and the fall of Rehe, the three leagues of Josutu, Juu Uda, and Jerim were reduced to another region. The Inner Mongolian autonomy that can be reliably led by our country only covers the northern parts of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, and the three leagues of Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Ih Ju, etc. Although the land is vast, the population is only over 300,000. Administratively, they have been劃 (huà: divide) into the province-level districts of Chahar and Suiyuan. Whether it is possible to break away from the guidance of the provincial government and start anew, I believe that the central and local officials must have considered it in detail. Moreover, the general economic trend of various banners in Inner Mongolia is currently transitioning from a nomadic economy to an agricultural economy. In other words, the reclamation is gradually developing. In the three lost banners of the Eastern League, there are many reclaimed and熟(shú: ripe) lands. The agricultural economy is gradually developing. This situation is set aside for now. In the two western leagues, such as Wuyuan and Linhe, counties have been established, and agriculture has progressed rapidly, with abundant products. Because of the natural endowment of the Hetao region, there is a model for overwhelming the livestock economy and establishing a new model. Then, political organization must also change accordingly. I fear that the autonomy requested by the Inner Mongolian princes is not sufficient to adapt to this emerging economic situation and meet the demands of the agricultural people.</p>
<p>Today, Inner Mongolia's border is located north of Outer Mongolia and southeast of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, and is threatened everywhere by strong neighbors. It feels insecure internally and tempted externally. For example, in Linxi, Rehe Province, Japanese spies, under the guise of operating trade, are勾引 (gōuyǐn: entice) princes of various banners and privately set up radio stations. Over the years, many have been fooled. The eastern leagues of Inner Mongolia live in dangerous situations without knowing that chaos has already broken out and still boast of themselves. This is not only the misfortune of the people of Inner Mongolia, but also a huge hidden danger for our country's future. If people with an established rural economic organization cannot resist foreign aggression and seek their own regeneration, how can Mongolians who live in a nomadic economy and move with water and grass be able to遏(è: restrain) the enemy's conspiracy and cope with Outer Mongolia's coercion?</p>
<p>In terms of national defense relations, Inner Mongolia currently occupies a special position in both geography and personnel. Although transportation is still inconvenient, it is militarily related to the entire national defense. In the past, when transportation tools were clumsy and weapons were not developed, vast deserts could resist the enemy cavalry's deep penetration and勉强 (miǎnqiǎng: barely) be a barrier to North China. Now, times have changed. The old Mongolian cavalry can no longer制服 (zhìfú: subdue) the rampant tanks and airplanes. In terms of economic situation, a nomadic economy has a scattered area and a sparse population. It is still difficult to resist an organized agricultural society, not to mention capitalism that has reached its peak. For now, the political relationship and national defense issues are put aside, and only the economic situation of Inner Mongolia is analyzed. In the past, when our country's political center was still in Beijing, Mongolian production still occupied a fairly important position in our north. Among the goods exported to foreign countries, such as leather, wool, and camel hair, the numbers were quite large. Recently, Outer Mongolia's products have already sought exports through Siberia, and Zhangjiakou-Kyakhta (張庫) transportation has been阻滯 (zǔzhì: obstructed). Not only does Inner Mongolia itself feel increasingly impoverished, but also the major cities in North China have suffered extremely serious impacts and enormous losses.</p>
<p>In short, today's Inner Mongolia, whether politically or economically, has very close and interrelated interests with our China, not as distant as it used to be, and cannot be allowed to establish its own system separately. Therefore, the Inner Mongolian autonomy issue must be in the same position as local autonomy. Differences in religious thought should be resolved culturally, and differences in economic structure must be adjusted economically. Otherwise, it will be easily exploited by strong neighbors and will ultimately not be beneficial to Mongolia or a blessing to our North China. For the sake of the country today, there is only one method: to make good use of the enthusiasm of Mongolian youth for improvement and to pacify the good intentions of the princes to be inward-oriented, so as to gradually seek a turning point.</p>
<h3>Japan's Drug Disaster in Our Northeast: Airplanes Scatter Leaflets Encouraging the Planting of Opium Poppies; Annual Sales Reach 33 Million Yen; US Representative Sternly Condemns at League of Nations Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva): At the public meeting of the League of Nations Advisory Committee held today, US Representative Fuller delivered警策 (jǐngcè: incisive) remarks, describing the current state of the opium trade in the northeastern provinces of China. The audience was shocked. Fuller said that in recent times in the Far East, especially in Manchuria and Rehe, the development of the narcotics situation has surprised the United States. For example, the establishment of so-called opium monopoly in violation of Chinese law can be called the only largest enterprise in the illegal narcotics trade. Its establishment of a monopoly aims to promote the smoking of opium. The current government指(zhǐ: point) the budget of the bogus country, estimated that the profit from the opium monopoly will reach about 10 million yen per year, and the opium it sells reaches about 33 million yen per year. The scale is imaginable. Fuller then criticized the Sino-Japanese Advisory Committee of the League of Nations for not proposing to recognize the licenses issued by the provisional government built under military occupation, and for helping it evade treaties. The US government does not know whether this procedure is really in accordance with the 1912 Hague Convention, so渠 (qú: he) specifically opposed the League of Nations Advisory Committee proposing such a suggestion when the powers still recognized China's sovereignty over Manchuria, and any suggestion to destroy the Hague Convention to facilitate the transportation of Manchurian opium. Fuller continued that the充斥 (chōngchì: glut) of opium has greatly increased the number of smokers in Manchuria and Rehe, and the number it produces greatly exceeds the number consumed locally, fearing that the remainder will be illegally transported and sold to the Chinese mainland. The Chinese representative supported Fuller's remarks, saying that they were completely in agreement with the Chinese government's opinion. The Italian representative also expressed his opinion on the serious opium situation in the Far East. The Japanese representative only requested that Fuller's remarks be fully published and did not say anything else. (Reuters Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Opium Monopoly Destroys International Action; Japan's Policy is Very Insidious</h3>
<p>(Geneva): US State Department official Fuller猛(měng: fiercely) attacked Manchuria's establishment of an opium monopoly at the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee today, saying that it is more than enough to destroy all the efforts of various countries to achieve international management of poisons. The United States also participated in this effort, hoping to establish a quota system to limit the production and sale of opium to only scientific and medical needs. Therefore, Fuller was sent to attend the Anti-Smoking Advisory Committee meeting. Fuller claimed at the meeting today that Japan's creation of an opium monopoly in Manchuria is a dangerous procedure with obviously malicious intentions, hoping to avoid the current treaties on the opium trade. This move will destroy the international management that has already been done on poisons. He also said that Manchuria's opium public sales regulations are completely inconsistent with the international management plans that all major countries have in mind. The plan implemented in Manchuria cannot reduce the smoking volume of those who have already smoked, and so on. The International Convention on Managing the Distribution of Poisons was implemented in thirty-six countries on July 10 this year. Many countries held celebrations at that time, considering it the beginning of stopping the opium trade. However, Japan and the Netherlands have not ratified this agreement. The Netherlands did not ratify it because opium is an important product in its colonies. Japan, according to Fuller's previous claim, knew as early as April this year, before the agreement's ratification period expired, that Manchuria was widely planting opium poppies and would implement an opium monopoly plan, so it did not want to ratify it. As for this agreement, it now only stipulates international management methods. Regarding international production and sales quotas, adjustments are still pending. This summer, countries investigated the actual required quantities for medical and scientific purposes and sent them to the Advisory Committee, hoping that a quota could be agreed upon and publicly announced before the end of this year.

<h3>Japanese Airplanes Scatter Leaflets Encouraging the Planting of Opium Poppies; All Countries Must Not Transport Opium to the Pseudo-State</h3>
<p>(Geneva): At the meeting of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee yesterday, US Representative Fuller痛(tòng: bitterly) criticized Japan for using various methods to encourage the planting of opium poppies in Northeast China, and even using airplanes to scatter leaflets throughout Manchuria and Rehe to persuade farmers to plant more opium poppies. Its intentions can be said to be meticulous. When Fuller spoke, he tried to avoid using the term "Manchukuo" and only referred to the three northeastern provinces of China and Rehe Province. His conclusion was that the situation in Manchuria is really a harm to the entire Far East and is sufficient to hinder the success of any action to prohibit the illegal trade in poisons. The Japanese representative, Yoshisaka (吉坂), after Fuller's speech, only said that he would need to read the full text of Fuller's speech before replying. The audience was surprised. (National Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva): The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee discussed the Belgian draft resolution all morning today, which stated: "Because the 'Manchukuo' and Rehe are in a special situation, governments of all countries should be asked not to allow poisons to be transported to Manchuria without the approval of the Opium Committee." (National Telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Opium Committee: Avoiding the Use of "Manchukuo" Name; Japanese Representative Extremely Dissatisfied</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This morning's open meeting of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee discussed the supply of narcotics needed by "Manchukuo." The discussion lasted a long time without a resolution. The meeting was then extended to this afternoon. The Italian representative proposed a resolution based on the first part of the Advisory Committee's statement. However, the Dutch representative claimed that the Netherlands intended to vote against it because the proposal exceeded the scope of the eighteen-nation committee's statement. The French representative then proposed the following resolution: "Because of the special circumstances in Manchuria and Jehol, it is proposed to seek more detailed information on the reported irregularities in the region. At the same time, governments should not approve requests for the trafficking of opium and narcotics without first consulting the Advisory Committee." The British representative said that this procedure was not practical. The French representative then asked whether the term "Manchuria and Jehol" could be used instead of "Manchukuo." The Japanese representative, Yokoyama, claimed that although the chairman had announced that political issues should not be mentioned, several speakers were still involved in political disputes. He proposed not participating in the discussion or voting, but if the name "Manchukuo" was deliberately changed, he would have to vote against it. The Chinese representative, Hu Shih-tse, proposed that China could not recognize the term "Manchukuo," but could agree to the use of "Manchuria and Jehol." He also said that if licenses were refused, the people of Manchuria and Jehol would not suffer, because China estimated that the narcotics needed, including those for Manchuria, were 20 kilograms of heroin, 100 kilograms of morphine, and 35 kilograms of cocaine. Japan's estimate, on the other hand, was 650 kilograms of heroin, 3,360 kilograms of morphine, and 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, because Japan could obtain a huge supply. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Preventing Aircraft from Transporting Opium; Tasking All Countries to Implement Effectively</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today's League of Nations Opium Conference discussed how to prevent the use of aircraft to transport drugs. The American representative, Mr. Fuller, stated that the United States Bureau had learned that the rampant spread of drugs within the country was due to drug traffickers being able to use aircraft for transportation. Therefore, the United States had established aviation police. It is reported that this matter of airborne opium trafficking was suggested for study by the Australian representative two years ago. Therefore, the League of Nations Opium Committee began investigating the laws and regulations of various countries to understand what preventive measures had already been implemented. It is said that Brazil has already promulgated extremely strict laws regarding this matter. The Committee has now decided to task governments to formulate effective methods for customs and police to prevent drug trafficking, especially regarding the management of private aircraft, such as mandatory searches, as being important.

<h3>Keshan Militia Engages in Hand-to-Hand Combat with Japanese Military Police</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Keshan branch of the Japanese Military Police, at 4 a.m. on October 31, went to the west gate to arrest a militia leader and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the militia. Superior Private Yamaguchi and interpreter Yano were both injured, and Superior Private Kikuchi was killed on the spot. (China United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Hirota's First Diplomatic Setback; The United States Expresses Extreme Difficulty in Understanding; Japan Begins Negotiations with Various Countries; The United States Does Not Recognize "Accomplished Facts"</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota conveyed the new diplomatic policy based on the results of the Five-Minister Conference to the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy, and instructed them to negotiate with the respective governments based on this policy. However, the United States Secretary of State, through a certain diplomatic channel, conveyed his opinion that in the current international environment, it would be extremely difficult to understand any political efforts between Japan and the United States. This indicates a rejection of Japan's intended political work with the United States. The reason is that the United States will demand the exclusion of the Monroe Doctrine, while Japan will demand that the New Agreement be applied to established facts. As a result, the so-called Japan-U.S. political work would be of no practical benefit. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying countermeasures to address the U.S. attitude hindering the promotion of Japan-U.S. political work. (Dentsu News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Tour Various Territorial Islands; Filipinos Request a Visit to the Far East</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. President announced his plan to tour various territorial islands next spring, indirectly hinting to Congress that he hopes the next session of Congress can conclude its business in a shorter period. It is reported that the news of the U.S. President's plan to tour the territorial islands initially came about when he met with representatives of Honolulu merchants. The representatives invited the President to tour Honolulu, and the President replied that if the next congressional session was not too long, he planned to visit Honolulu next spring. Subsequently, the White House also announced that if Congress adjourned early next spring, the President would take a cruiser to tour the Panama Canal, Puerto Rico, and Honolulu. However, the Philippines was not included in the itinerary due to its remoteness. However, it is heard that Filipinos in Washington, D.C., will ask the island government to invite the President to visit the Far East to tour the island. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Another Coup by Japanese Military Faction; Saito Remains Optimistic</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Army Minister Araki's attitude towards rural, educational, and ideological issues has attracted attention from various quarters. It is expected that the Army Minister will express some major opinions at the next cabinet meeting. However, Army Minister Araki has realized that the opinions of the cabinet members on domestic policies differ greatly from what the Army Minister believes. Unless there is a major determination, it is difficult to see the realization of his national policy. Moreover, Prime Minister Saito's attitude towards the Army Minister's proposals is extremely passive. In light of these facts, Army Minister Araki may temporarily observe the situation. However, the military is already dissatisfied with the inaction of the cabinet, and the future is quite noteworthy. (Domei News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army's grand maneuvers have ended, and the budget is being drafted. Therefore, the political season is about to begin. However, there have been various views on the path forward. The existence of the following two theories makes the future of the political situation quite delicate. One is the so-called coup theory from a faction within the Seiyukai and the House of Peers and the military. The reasons they hold are: (1) Before the extraordinary situation of 1936, it is necessary to implement various measures, but the Saito cabinet inevitably lacks such means. (2) Although the diplomatic and defense policies determined by the Five-Minister Conference have been tortuous, the fundamental direction has already been established. However, there is a lack of sincerity or a taciturn attitude on domestic policy issues. (3) Even on the understanding of the current situation, the views among cabinet members are not consistent, showing the disunity within the cabinet. (4) Those who are responsible for the extraordinary situation must embody the spirit of the Empire, and a strong and powerful cabinet is necessary. However, the Minseito party and those close to the Prime Minister hold the following optimistic views: (1) Before and after the budget compilation, there are always rumors of a coup, but in fact, there is no reliable basis. (2) Not only is it impossible to think about a cabinet after the Saito cabinet, but there are also no difficulties that would cause the current cabinet to resign. (3) When the budget is compiled, military spending will definitely be finalized after the Five-Minister Conference. As for other parts, it can be resolved by Ministers Takahashi and Yamamoto.

<h3>Japan-India Conference on the Verge of Rupture; Japan to Propose Final Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-India Treaty, which was tentatively extended by one month, has only eight days left before it expires. Unless both sides show a willingness to compromise, the Japan-India negotiations will inevitably break down. The Japanese government, taking into account the opinions of the people, seems to have decided to submit a final proposal. It is reported that the content is as follows: the import volume of cotton cloth is 400 million yards, and the purchase volume of Indian cotton is 1 million bales. However, the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth imported by India is not limited and can be increased or decreased based on the "Bada system." This system uses 1 million bales and 2 million yards as the standard. This proposal is a major concession compared to the original plan, with a concession of 15.7 million yards in cotton cloth volume. The number of Indian cotton purchases is set at 1 million bales per year. Japan believes that this proposal is the most reasonable, but whether the people will be satisfied is still questionable. The success or failure of the Japan-India negotiations is at the final step. (Domei News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota instructed the Japanese delegation, and its contents are roughly as follows: The ratio of the amount of cotton cloth imported in the Indian proposal to the number of Indian cotton sold is 10,000 bales of Indian cotton to 2 million yards of cotton cloth. Comparing the prices, it is a ratio of 1.23 million yuan to 300,000 yuan. The ratio is four to one, which is quite unbalanced. Japan demands that the ratio be changed to two to one. Japan absolutely opposes the method of dividing the period for India to import cotton cloth into four periods each year and treating them differently according to type. In addition, India uses the "long yard" as the unit for measuring cotton cloth, and Japan requires India to clearly explain its concept. (Domei News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Delhi) It is heard that the Indian side formally submitted its final proposal at the meeting on the 30th. Its contents are as follows: (1) The base for the purchase volume of cotton is 1 million bales, and the base for the import volume of cotton cloth is 325 million square yards. (2) For each increase or decrease of one bale of cotton from this base volume, the cotton cloth will increase or decrease by 150 yards. (3) The maximum limit for the import volume of cotton cloth is 400 million square yards. As a result, to export 400 million square yards of cotton cloth, it is necessary to purchase 1.5 billion bales of cotton. Compared with the maximum of 50,000 yards of the final proposal for Japanese textile manufacturers, there is a difference of 100 million yards. The information that the Japanese government and textile manufacturers have conflicting opinions on this issue has aroused the Indian side's interest. Various newspapers have published various dramatic commentaries every day. The government newspaper, "The Statesman," stated that the members of parliament hope that the government will conclude negotiations by November 10, the expiration date of the Japan-India Treaty. It also stated that the government is also studying what to do if Japan does not agree to India's proposal and there is no decision by November 10, at which time the treaty cannot be extended. The degree to which this statement can be trusted is doubtful. Representative Sawada will hold a private meeting with Director Boyer next Monday. (Dentsu News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>South Manchuria Railway Reorganization Plan; Japan Acknowledges Great Impact</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan planned by the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency has not yet been notified to the central government agencies, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and the Ministry of Finance. It is also doubtful whether the Kwantung Army's finalized plan, regarding the detailed technical content, has been completed early on. Therefore, even if the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency's plan is realized and can overcome financial difficulties in practice to make it concrete, the national control needed for the entire Japanese economy will also cause problems. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the central authorities of the Japanese government can swallow the reorganization plan whole. Therefore, in general, regarding this reorganization plan, because the impact on Japan's domestic politics and economy is very significant, government departments advocate carefully monitoring its future. It is heard that its direction is as follows: (1) The South Manchuria Railway currently owns railways, ironworks, coal mines, and other important industries, as well as local administrative undertakings. If these are completely separated, then the South Manchuria Railway will only be a separate general company. This abstract theory is completely correct. (2) If the various separated industries, especially those related to military importance, are controlled by the Kwantung Army, then the production, consumption, and sales of its steel, coal, and other important industries will be limited to within "Manchukuo." The Japanese mainland's industry cannot be controlled by the state, and it is clear that the ultimate purpose cannot be achieved. (3) If all important military-related industries in the Japanese mainland are controlled by the state, this is not only an economic problem, but also contains significant political and institutional reforms. (4) The total capital of the South Manchuria Railway is currently 800 million yen, which is funded equally by the government and businesses. In addition, it also bears enormous corporate bonds. For the sake of control, how should the expenses be handled, and how should the shareholders be discounted and compensated? All kinds of situations contain difficulties and are actually not trivial.

<h3>New Revolution Brewing in Cuba; Military Faction Colluding with Rampant Political Parties; President San Martin Uneasy in His Position; Twelve Bombings in One Night, People Unable to Sleep Peacefully; Provinces Beyond Central Control, Chaotic Situation</h3>
<p>Havana The collapse of the university professor government formed by Cuba's San Martin is inevitable tonight. Currently, acts of violence such as throwing bombs and rushing attacks continue unabated among the various political parties. Although the police are fully armed, they seem unable to control the situation. Now, under the order of Batista, restrictions have been placed on the activities of night market centers, and additional patrols have been dispatched between streets. Rumors are rampant that National Unity Party leader Mendiete will use the army to overthrow the current government in the near future. Even Batista, who currently holds real power, seems dissatisfied with the current government and often comes into contact with the National Unity Party leader. Batista, who also serves as the commander-in-chief of the army and police, has ordered a ban on all demonstrations, but the sound of gunfire continues unabated in the streets, which may not decrease until the government is changed. Tonight, in general, military officers seem to be following the orders jointly issued by Batista and Mendiete. As for the situation in the provinces, they are now beyond central control, and several places are reportedly close to a state of anarchy. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Havana The Cuban political world is now awaiting Mendiete's decision on whether he is willing to assume the position of interim president after the overthrow of the San Martin government. Twelve bombings occurred in Cuba's capital in one night. Most of these bombs exploded, and residents were unable to sleep peacefully. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Havana Rumors are circulating in the Cuban capital that President San Martin and Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista will leave Cuba tonight, but officials claim that this news is untrue. According to sources in charge, if a coalition cabinet can be formed in Cuba, the United States can immediately recognize it and provide military assistance. If necessary, thousands of troops will first land in Havana, and if that is not enough, a second batch of about 15,000 people will be sent to resolve the Cuban political situation.

<h3>French New Prime Minister Announces Policy Guidelines; Reducing Expenditure and Increasing Revenue to Stabilize Finances; Diplomacy Following the Policies of the Previous Cabinet; Restricting Imports to Protect Industry; Developing the Markets of the Colonies</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Sarraut new government today announced its administrative guidelines in parliament this afternoon, with balancing the budget and stabilizing finances as the key to the new cabinet's program, advocating (1) immediate and effective cost reduction, (2) reducing excessively high taxes in order to reduce production costs and stimulate economic activity, (3) adopting plans to crack down on tax avoidance, (4) implementing a large-scale public works program, with particular emphasis on the development of motor transport, (5) protecting French industry, continuing the import quota system, and not giving preferential treatment to other countries except for reciprocal treatment, (6) developing the markets of the French colonies. The new government stated that it supports the continuation of French foreign policy in terms of treaty obligations and Anglo-American cooperation in continuing disarmament efforts. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new French Prime Minister Sarraut had previously presented an outline of the new cabinet's major policy guidelines to be announced in both houses to the cabinet meeting. At today's state council meeting in the afternoon, Sarraut read the finalized draft to the cabinet members, which was unanimously approved. In these major policy guidelines, Sarraut will declare that the government intends to submit a new fiscal plan to both houses in the near future, the main points of which are (1) large-scale savings in government expenses, (2) greatly reorganizing tax revenues through various methods. Sarraut also intends to explain that the government will use the output of the colonies to supplement the insufficient output of the mainland, but not to compete with the mainland's commerce. He also intends to broadly conclude economic compromises internationally. As for diplomatic issues, he will continue France's original policy and advocate trusting the League of Nations and earnestly fulfilling the treaties signed between France and the major countries of the world. Tomorrow morning at 10:00, a state council meeting will still be held at the Presidential Palace, chaired by President Lebrun. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Under Dictatorial Politics; Italian Government to Be Reorganized; Mussolini Holds Six Positions Concurrently; Minister of Aviation Retires After Accomplishing His Mission</h3>
<p>Rome It is heard tonight that the Italian government will be completely reorganized in the near future, and in order to increase efficiency and reduce expenses, several departments will be reorganized. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini already oversees both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Corporations. In the future, he plans to also oversee the three departments of the navy, army, and air force, concentrating six important positions in one person. The current Minister of Aviation, Balbo, who became famous for flying across the Atlantic, will resign from his cabinet post and retain the rank of Air Force General. Other ministers, such as Minister of Agriculture Acerbo, Minister of Education Auclair, Minister of the Army Chloralanzay, Minister of the Navy Sheariani, and one or two other ministers, will resign before Minister of Aviation Balbo in order to reorganize departmental affairs. In the future, since the three national defense departments will be led by the Prime Minister, it is heard that a commander-in-chief will be set up to oversee the affairs of the three departments, ranking second to Mussolini, so that the three services of the navy, army, and air force can be more closely linked, and military spending can also be reduced.

<h3>Abolishing the Parliamentary Election System; To Be Replaced by Occupational Representation</h3>
<p>Rome The Italian parliamentary election system will soon be abolished, and an occupational representation system will be implemented in the future.

<h3>British Municipal Council Elections; Labor Party Rising in Power; Parliament Reopens to Impeach the Government; Current Cabinet Preparing Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(London) The Government Party failed in the recent by-election for members of parliament in East Fulham, England. The Labor Party also won major victories in municipal council elections in various places. Therefore, Prime Minister MacDonald and his cabinet members have realized the need to arouse public opinion to support the current government. It is expected that when the House of Commons reopens, Labor Party members will file a motion to impeach the government. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The final results of the municipal elections in 346 municipalities in England and Wales, except for the London area, all indicate a major victory for the Labor Party. The Labor Party captured 261 seats from its opposing parties. After deducting the 19 seats it lost, the Labor Party gained 242 seats more than before. The Conservative Party and the National Labor Party lost 208 seats, and the Liberal Party lost 34 seats. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) As a result of the municipal council elections, the news reported by various newspapers is inconsistent. According to the Labor Party newspaper, the Labor Party won 252 seats, while Conservative Party newspapers said that the Labor Party gained no more than 180 seats more than the opposing parties. It is generally said that half of the Labor Party's candidates were also party-elected. In the election in Kirkmairlock, Scotland, the National Government-affiliated Labor Party won. Prime Minister MacDonald's friend, Lindsay, received 12,577 votes, while the Labor Party candidate who opposed the government received only 9,904 votes. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Political Reform in Portugal; General Election to Be Held in January Next Year; Constitutional Provisions Replace Dictatorship; Government Only Responsible to the Nation</h3>
<p>Lisbon The Portuguese government today issued a nationwide proclamation, announcing that a general election will be held in January next year, and constitutional provisions will replace dictatorship. However, it is heard that the parliamentary government system will be abolished forever. It is reported that the new electoral law was promulgated this summer and adopted by a vote of the citizens' assembly. It was decided that traditional political parties will not be allowed to continue to exist. The government is only responsible to the nation and no longer responsible to the parliament. Now that domestic order is well established and the danger of revolution has been eliminated, the new government of the future can operate peacefully and realize its plans and doctrines one by one.

<h3>U.S. Purchases Gold from the UK and France; Currency War May Be Avoided; Roosevelt's Policy Intended to Maintain a Sound Dollar; To Increase Domestic Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) News from New York today stated that the Federal Reserve Bank had contacted the Bank of England and the Bank of France respectively to purchase pounds and francs. This move by the bank was obviously due to the instructions of the Reserve Board. Therefore, everyone expects that a currency war can be avoided in the future. At the same time, the White House claimed that President Roosevelt remains optimistic about the gold plan and is confident that domestic prices will rise after overseas gold prices weaken. Economists generally say that when the U.S. President announced the gold plan, he said that he would maintain a sound dollar domestically, which obviously refers to this. However, the currency situation is still chaotic. Some experts believe that the President will, in the next period of time, seek a lower level of the dollar abroad, hoping to show the domestic currency inflation faction that general currency inflation is not a good strategy. However, the President will still cancel the purchase of gold abroad at any time, so as not to suffer harmful results domestically. This plan is a good test for mitigating currency devaluation. Economists who are usually very close to the President's currency actions say that the experiment of suppressing currency prices abroad cannot be regarded as abandoning a portion of a sound monetary policy.

<p>Gold Purchase Plan</p>
<h3>From the Hands of University Professors</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, it was learned from reliable sources that the new U.S. President's gold purchase plan was first proposed by Professor Warren of Cornell University. The President was initially unwilling to implement it, fearing that it would provide little help in raising prices, but would instead create many troubles. Professor Warren is the Director of the Department of Rural Economics at Cornell University and is currently serving as the President's economic advisor. His proposed gold plan aims to reconcile the inflation faction and the gold standard restoration faction and strike a balance between them. It is heard that when the President announced the plan to purchase gold overseas, Warren fought hard to keep his position, believing that devaluing the gold dollar, especially depreciating the exchange rate, is the only way to avoid inflating paper money at present. It is also heard that Warren had a fierce debate with economists and currency banking experts from the Federal Reserve Board, including Leffler, on this monetary policy. Leffler is one of the most famous economists in the United States, and when he served as the President's chief advisor, he was often summoned to the White House to consult on economic issues. His usual advocacy is to vigorously support a sound monetary policy. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Outflow of French Cash Has Nothing to Do with Roosevelt's Policies</h3>

<h3>Central Government Orders Sun's Troops to Wait for Spring Warmth Before Moving West; Sun Dianying Sends Representatives to Jiangxi; Ningxia Provincial Committee Cancels Resignation Intention</h3>

<h3>Taking Over Various Passes of the Great Wall - Resolution Expected for Customs and Transportation Issues - Chiba has flown from Changchun to Peiping - Charged with resolving various issues with our side</h3>
<p>Peiping dispatch: The issues in the war zone, since the remaining troops of Fang Ji resolved the bandits in Ludong and the bandit suppression progressed smoothly, have been followed by negotiations on more complex issues. Recent efforts by both sides have progressed quite smoothly. Among the most important is the taking over of various passes of the Great Wall and the establishment of customs, the opening of the Beining Railway to traffic, and the handling of postal services. This is because our country's policy has always been to refuse to recognize the puppet state, and these issues invariably involve puppet organizations, making the negotiations quite difficult. The various passes of the Great Wall were not clearly stipulated in the Tanggu Truce. Moreover, the Japanese side is bound to station troops in places such as Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou for military purposes. How can we take over to make the name match the reality? This is one problem. In fact, beyond the Great Wall is like a foreign land. Without setting up customs to collect taxes, not only will Japanese and Kwantung goods be imported without taxes, but goods from various countries can also be imported from Dalian, a free trade port, to share the benefits of not paying taxes. If this is the case, taxation, commerce, and finance will all be greatly affected, and the harm will be incalculable. However, if we want to set up customs at the various passes of the Great Wall, it will involve puppet organizations, and it will implicitly recognize Kwantung as a foreign land. This is another problem. As for the issues of the opening of the Beining Railway to traffic and postal services, they all have the same complex relationships. The Kwantung sections of the Beining Railway have been renamed the puppet Fengshan Railway by the puppet organization. The postage stamps used in Kwantung are also printed by the puppet organization. Once the railway is open to traffic and postal services are connected, the puppet organization's vehicles and stamps will inevitably appear within the passes. Wouldn't there be suspicion of impropriety? Because of these relationships, progress has been particularly difficult. Recently, after several thorough studies and practical negotiations between the two sides, it is said that appropriate measures have been determined. In the future, customs will be established separately at the various passes of the Great Wall, and the Beining Railway can also directly reach traffic. The issue of establishing customs will be realized after the Ministry of Finance has made a detailed investigation and plan. The issue of opening to traffic is being planned by the Beining Railway Bureau. Chiba, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy responsible for the negotiations, was previously summoned by the commander of the Kwantung Army, Hishikari, and took a plane sent from Kwantung to Shenyang, then went to Changchun to confer with Hishikari. He then went from Changchun to Shenyang and took a plane to Chengde to visit Matsubara Takao, the head of the Kwantung Army's special service agency in Chengde, to discuss everything. This morning (the 2nd) at 10 o'clock, he returned to Peiping from Chengde by plane, charged with negotiating with our side to resolve the various issues in the war zone. Considerable progress is expected within days.</p>
<p>The bandits in the war zone, after being suppressed, have scattered and fled. The bandits besieged in Funing are now exhausted. For the sake of the local people, the authorities initially left a way out for them. However, the bandits persisted in their evil ways, and it has now been decided to actively suppress them. They should be wiped out soon. Relief in the war zone is urgent, and the disaster relief has already been completed. Agricultural relief will be carried out after the public bonds are issued. Now that the public bond regulations have been passed, they can be issued. They are currently being discussed with the banking community. The Ludong, Yushu, Jizhou, and Miyun administrative supervisory commissioner's offices, after Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming returned north, are actively proceeding, setting up offices separately in Tangshan and Tongzhou. The seals of office were put into use yesterday. (November 2nd dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Story of Fang Zhenwu's Death: Killed by Random Gunfire After Escaping From the Xinhe Bridge</h3>
<p>Peiping dispatch: After Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang left the army, Ji Hongchang has arrived in Tianjin, while Fang's whereabouts are unknown. Various speculations have arisen in the outside world. Some say that he has arrived in Tianjin, others that he has passed through Tianjin and fled south to Guangdong, and still others that he has met with misfortune. There are various rumors, and no one knows the truth. Until recently, the truth has gradually become clear. According to reliable information from a certain party, after Fang, Ji Hongchang, and others took a car east from Fengjiaying, they encountered a military inspection near the Xinhe Bridge. Fang escaped midway and was later discovered and chased. Fang fled on foot. Before he had gone far, he was overtaken and shot to death in a hail of gunfire. The matter was kept quite secret afterwards, and there was much speculation in the outside world. Various parties telegraphed Peiping to inquire, but no information was obtained.

<h3>The Panchen Lama Will Go to Beijing to Report to the Central Government on the Truth About Inner Mongolian Autonomy. Prince De's Representative Says He Will Not Participate in the Border Administration Department.</h3>
<p>Peiping dispatch: The issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy has been pending for a long time. After Huang Shaoxiong went to Mongolia to pacify the region, the Panchen Lama sent his representative Xia Kanbu Ciren from Bailingmiao to visit Huang, expressing his welcome and reporting on the proceedings of the Bailingmiao meeting. The gist of it was that the various cases passed were not final decisions and were awaiting a decision from the central government. The Panchen Lama's position on the issue of autonomy is to obey the central government. Zhangjia Hutuktu, the pacification envoy of the Mongolian banners, has recently been suffering from a severe stomach ailment, and the date of his trip to Mongolia must be set after he recovers. According to those close to Zhangjia, Zhangjia is wholeheartedly obedient to the central government and only follows the orders of the central government. The task of the pacification envoy is not to use religion to control the Inner Mongolian people, but to promote the central government's benevolence towards Inner Mongolia. The Inner Mongolian people do not understand the intentions of the central government, and the central government does not understand the psychology of the Inner Mongolian people, so Zhangjia is introducing them. Therefore, the pacification envoy's office is a mechanism for introduction and transmission. Zhangjia has not fully understood the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy. After Director Gong arrived in Mongolia, he sent a telegram reporting on the situation in Mongolia. As for the actual situation of Inner Mongolian autonomy, it is still under investigation. Zhangjia himself does not know the actual situation until it is clarified, and there is no reason to obstruct autonomy. Inner Mongolian autonomy is the same as local autonomy. Foreign affairs and military affairs are still under the control of the central government. Since Inner Mongolia obeys the central government, Zhangjia has no need to obstruct autonomy.</p>
<p>Zhang Yueqing, the representative of Prince De, went to Jurentang yesterday to visit He Yingqin. Because He was receiving foreign guests, he did not have the opportunity to meet him and plans to visit He again within the next few days, and then return to Suiyuan to meet Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian, and then enter Mongolia with them. According to him, the Japanese side is very dissatisfied because the princes of western Mongolia did not participate in the eastern Mongolia conference. Therefore, they are doing their best to undermine Inner Mongolian autonomy. Because Outer Mongolia has already been occupied, the Communist Party is even more covetous of Inner Mongolia, so they also disapprove of the proposal for Inner Mongolian autonomy. When the Panchen Lama arrived in Bailingmiao, he advised the princes to proceed cautiously with autonomy, and the central government would definitely have appropriate measures. The Panchen Lama himself was urged by the central government to go to Beijing, and he planned to travel south immediately after the Bailingmiao conference ended. At present, the princes of Inner Mongolia are eagerly awaiting the arrival of senior officials from the central government in Bailingmiao to give appropriate instructions on Inner Mongolian autonomy. As for the princes' request to delineate the border of Suiyuan and the northern border of Chahar Province as the Inner Mongolian autonomous region, if the senior officials of the central government have appropriate measures for this matter, the scope of the region is not very important, and the princes will not insist. Because Inner Mongolian autonomy is demanded by the local people, even after autonomy is established, all political, military, and financial matters will still be under the control of the central government. As long as the arrangements are appropriate, the princes will all be happy to comply. Li Songfeng and others went to Bailingmiao and are scheduled to stay for about a week and will still return to Suiyuan. Because Minister Huang and others are waiting in Suiyuan, he will go to Suiyuan after meeting Acting Chairman He, and then go to Bailingmiao. (2nd Jin)</p>
<h3>Lampson Will Return Home, Bidding Farewell in Peiping and Speaking Cordially of the Central Government's Friendliness, Humbly Hoping That China Will Advance to Become a World Power</h3>
<p>Peiping dispatch: Sir Miles Lampson, the British Minister to China, has been ordered to be transferred to Egypt as a special envoy. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 20th of this month and leave Shanghai by sea on the 28th to return home for instructions before going to Egypt to take up his new post. The new British Minister to China, Sir John Brenan, is expected to arrive in Peiping in early February next year to take over the post. Because Lampson has been stationed in China for more than ten years, in order to express his farewell, he invited the Peiping press to meet at the British Embassy yesterday (the 1st) at 3:00 p.m. and made the following statement: "I am being transferred to Egypt and am scheduled to leave China by ship from Shanghai on the 28th of this month. I have served as the British Minister to China for seven years. If I include the time I spent as a counselor at the British Embassy in China, I have lived in Peiping, China, for more than ten years. Therefore, Peiping is like my second hometown. I am very sad and nostalgic to be leaving now. During my ten years in China, I have witnessed tremendous changes in China's politics, society, and economy. The most notable developments are the national revival, the development of education and industry and commerce, and the progress of material construction, such as the increase in the number of factories and the construction of public utilities such as aviation, transportation, and highways. The development of sports is especially noteworthy. I have seen the good performance of the athletes and the enthusiasm of the spectators at the National Games in Beijing this time, which I have never seen in the past. As for China's politics and law, I cannot feel the same way. However, there has also been progress in Chinese politics. Although there are many disappointing aspects, it has gradually become quite consolidated in the past six years. The relationship between China and Britain and the feelings between the people of the two countries have become closer. Although there have been some misunderstandings in the past, they have been resolved because both sides have been able to understand each other's strengths and relationships. After I leave China, I am determined to work hard to build the friendly relations between China and Britain on the basis of frankness, respect, and mutual understanding. What is particularly noteworthy here is that the British people's interest in Chinese politics is no different from that of the Chinese people. The British people all sincerely hope that China will become a strong country. Britain has no ambitions towards China and only hopes that China will be stable and orderly so that Sino-British commerce can develop. I am about to leave China and would like to offer a few words as a farewell gift. I humbly hope that the Chinese people will work hard for unity, peace, and construction. The birth of the Republic of China twenty-two years ago was achieved through great hardship and struggle. I hope that the Chinese people will continue to adhere to this spirit and work harder on the aforementioned points so as to advance to become one of the world's great powers. My faith and hope in China remain the same." (2nd Jin)</p>
<h3>Commander of Guangdong's Second Army, Xiang Hanping, Suddenly Resigns. Chen Jitang Personally Tried to Persuade Him to Stay Without Success. Xiang Submitted Two Resignations and Has Already Gone to Hong Kong.</h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Since the replacement of the commander of the Fourth Division, which was stationed in Jiangxi and Fujian, by the General Headquarters of the First Army Group, the newly appointed commander of the Fourth Division, Zhang Da, has arrived in Xinfeng to take over. Zhang Meixin, who was the commander of the Fourth Division, has returned to the province from the front, but has no intention of taking the post of deputy chief of staff of the General Headquarters. However, the change of the commander of the Fourth Division not only made Zhang Meixin adopt a negative attitude, but also made Xiang Hanping, the commander of the Second Army, who directly commanded the Fourth Division, suddenly submit his resignation from all his posts. It is reported that Xiang is currently serving as the commander of the Second Army and a member of the Central District Pacification Commissioner's Office. He is an old general of Chen Jitang's faction. Since Xiang submitted his resignation, he has refused to see guests. The affairs of the Second Army have been handed over to Ye Minyu, the chief of staff of the army, to act as his agent. The affairs of the Central District Pacification Commissioner's Office have been handed over to Li Yukun, the chief of staff of the office, to act as his agent. Chen Jitang was distressed that Xiang suddenly became negative. At about 1:00 p.m. on October 25, he specially accompanied Zhang Guoyuan, the director of the General Headquarters Office, Lin Yizhong, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Chen Weizhou, the salt transport commissioner, and others to Xiang's private residence to persuade him to stay, and dismissed the attendants for a confidential conversation of two hours. Xiang insisted on resigning temporarily to recuperate, and strongly stated that he had been mentally exhausted recently and dared not take on arduous tasks. He planned to return to his hometown of Hepu County during the day. Chen and others left in a car, seeing that Xiang's intention would not be moved. When they returned to the General Headquarters, Xiang's second resignation was submitted again. Chen Jitang then approved a one-month leave and, since Xiang refused to cancel his resignation, he summoned Miao Peinan, Du Yiqian, Li Hanhun, and others at his private residence in Meihuacun on the 26th to discuss Xiang's resignation. Xiang submitted two resignations, and his attitude was extremely firm. Even his concurrent post as the Guangdong Aid Volunteer Army Guidance Officer was submitted to the provincial party headquarters for resignation, requesting that another officer be appointed to fill the post. As for the affairs of the Second Army, Xiang handed them over to Chief of Staff Ye Minyu to act as his agent. However, Ye also requested leave yesterday, so the affairs of the army headquarters had to be temporarily handled by Li Zhendong, the director of the general staff office. It is said that Xiang left the province for Hong Kong on the 26th after his resignation was submitted to the General Headquarters. (October 29)</p>

<h3>County Government Convenes Winter Defense Conference</h3>
<p>The county government previously received a report from Shen Jing, the director of the Public Security Bureau, stating that robberies were occurring frequently in various places and that maintaining local peace and security required early arrangements for winter defense. County Magistrate Jin, based on the report, immediately sent letters to various agencies and district chiefs, ordering them to hold a meeting in the county government on the 2nd. District chiefs and representatives of the water and land military police agencies attended. After the chairman reported the intention of convening the meeting, after discussion by the public, they all agreed that the harvest was just beginning in various townships and that robbery cases were occurring frequently in various townships. If winter defense was not arranged early, the security situation in various places during the winter would be very worrying. Therefore, it was resolved that the winter defense period for this year would be set for four months. A winter defense office would be established in the county government to preside over the winter defense affairs of the entire county. The district offices would cooperate with the district chiefs and the Public Security Bureau. They must all report their establishment by November 16. The recruitment, funding, and attendance of the winter defense corps and militia members will still be handled by each district according to the precedents of previous years, as the situation in each place is different.</p>
<h3>Motorboats Levy Business Tax</h3>
<p>Motorboats traveling between this port and other ports are the only effective means of water transportation for passengers and goods. Recently, due to the impact of the decline in industry and commerce, business has plummeted, and some may not be able to maintain operations and have to shut down. The Business Tax Bureau believes that motorboats have merchants traveling to and from their destinations according to regulations, so they are all taxed. It has already notified all motorboat companies to abide by the tax payment in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Robbers in the Xihutang Case Sent to Province</h3>
<p>The house of Cai Peida, a wealthy household in Xihutang, was robbed of more than 10,000 yuan in yarn currency. The county government ordered an investigation, and Fei Gongxia, a patrol officer of the Water Patrol Team, captured Deng Xiaofu, a key suspect in the case, in Punan. Deng confessed without hesitation and said that the pistol was borrowed from Xu Ganshi, a wealthy household in Chongque. Based on the report, County Magistrate Jin ordered Shen Bangda, the captain of the Water Patrol Team, to investigate secretly. Xu Ganshi also stated that the self-defense pistol had been inspected and verified and could not have been lent to bandits. He claimed that Deng Xiaofu was falsely accusing him out of malice and requested the county government to investigate the false accusation. The bandit Deng Xiaofu was escorted to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office today by Dong Futang and other political police officers dispatched by the county government with an official document to investigate and punish him.</p>

<h3>Guo Jinfeng Arrested for Defrauding Money in the Name of Others</h3>
<p>Guo Jinfeng (also known as Dequn), a well-known rascal in Yangjiahang, the fifth district of Chuansha, usually recruited many apprentices, ran rampant in the countryside, specialized in extortion, and committed numerous crimes, causing much harm to the local people. Recently, he has become even more intensified and dares to summon his gang, using the name of conscripting laborers, to break into people's homes in the Yanghang area at night, intimidate them at will, extort money on the pretext of various things, and disrupt public order, not to mention extorting hundreds of silver dollars from farmers Zhu Pansheng, Zhang Qigou, Ji Rujin, Gu Lianqing, Yu Jitang, etc. Now, it has been reported by the Fifth District Security Corps that on November 2, instructor Song Shengyu, along with Zhu Qinshou, Tang Yingkui, and others, secretly dispatched to the Wangpeng Wo field, and Guo and his cohorts Yang Xuetian and Chen Fubao were summoned to the district for questioning. After verification, they were all sent to the county for disposal.</p>

<h3>Wine Merchants Petition to Avoid Inspection of Stored Wine</h3>
<p>The local Oil, Wine, and Sauce Industry Association reported that members Wang Yingji and others reported to the association that the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Inspection Branch Bureau will send personnel to investigate the local yellow wine stored in various stores. The association believes that the stores are for retail purposes and not workshops. Moreover, the local yellow wine has already been taxed according to regulations, so there is no need for investigation. If misunderstandings arise due to the investigation, causing disputes, merchants will feel even more difficult. Therefore, yesterday (the 3rd), more than ten representatives, including Wu Jiesheng, were specially sent to the County Chamber of Commerce to petition. Chairman Shi immediately telegraphed Director Ding of the branch bureau to send Huang Zuoliang to the meeting to negotiate with the wine merchants. Huang said that this matter was an order from the head office and promised to forward the merchants' views and request instructions. The merchants were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<h3>A Monk Plots to Kill the Resident Monk</h3>
<p>About five miles south of Xueyanqiao Town, at the junction of Wuxi and Changzhou, there is an ancient temple called Liaoge Temple, with more than ten monks of various sizes. The incense money received on weekdays is not enough to cover expenses, and the losses are very large. After the abbot He Song died, there was no one to preside over the temple. Liang Ru, the abbot of Guangfu Temple in Yuantouzhu, Wuxi, was specially invited to take concurrent management. However, Liang Ru concurrently manages many temples in Wuxi and cannot reside in the temple regularly. He entrusted the management to the monk Bai Song in the temple for about a year before resigning. Then, the monk Shun Song took over as the abbot, also with the consent of Liang Ru. After Shun Song took charge, all the monks in the temple did not obey his orders. On the night of the previous day (the 1st), at about 10:00 p.m., he was tricked out by the monks Han Song and Chang De of the same temple, pretending to go to the fields to catch badger dogs (i.e., wild boars). Chang De held a single-edged sword, and Shun Song held a shotgun, ordering Shun Song to wait by the vegetable garden and instructing him to guard the badger dogs. Han Song saw that the plan had been sold, and shouted that the badger dogs were coming. Shun Song did not notice and opened his eyes wide, waiting for the badger dogs to pass by, wanting to fire the shotgun to hit them. At this time, Han Song threw the lime bag at Shun Song's eyes, and Chang De took the opportunity to slash at Shun Song with the single-edged sword. Seeing this, Shun Song immediately used his hand to block it, cutting his arm and fingers. Shun Song immediately fell to the ground, pretending to be silent. Seeing that Shun Song was not moving, Chang De and Han Song suspected that he was dead, and immediately fled back to the temple, pretending that nothing had happened. Seeing the two people go away, Shun Song fled to the lakeside and hired a boat to report to the Xueyanqiao Security Corps. The corps saw that Shun Song's injuries were very serious, and immediately transferred him to the Tenth District Office in Panjiaqiao. District Chief Wang ordered Shun Song to go to the Wujin County Court for examination. Meanwhile, he ordered the militiamen to go to Liaoge Temple to arrest the murderers, who had already escaped without a trace. Even the monk Bai Song has disappeared, and it is feared that he is also involved. Yesterday, after Liang Ru learned about this in Wuxi, he immediately rushed to the temple to investigate in order to report to the court to arrest the murderers and handle them according to law.</p>
<h3>Farmers Riot While Urging the Payment of Silver Grain</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, because the silver grain arrears of various counties are very large, in addition to ordering the counties to step up the urging of payment, also sent commissioners to the counties to supervise. After Wang Xunyuan, who was sent to this county, arrived in Wuxi, he actively urged the payment. In recent days, the number of receipts from the grain counters seems to have improved. Zhou Rulin, the tax collector of the sixth district, because Song A'xiao, a farmer in Songxiang Shang Township, Tugu 532, in the district, owed a considerable amount of Chen grain, had repeatedly urged him to pay, but Song always postponed. Tianfu Director Zhu Kaiguan sent tax collector Mao Sheng to take a boat to the countryside and summon Song A'xiao to the case for interrogation. After Mao arrived in the countryside, he immediately put Song in the boat. Unexpectedly, suddenly dozens of villagers, including Li A'gen and Song Xi'laoxian, surrounded Mao Sheng with great momentum, forcing him to release Song, otherwise they would beat him with their fists. Mao was outnumbered and had no choice but to leave and returned to the city to report to Director Zhu, who in turn reported to County Magistrate Yan and Commissioner Wang for handling. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Yan immediately sent political police Du Youlin and others to the countryside at night to arrest the criminals. Who knew that Song and others had again gathered more than a hundred villagers and rioted for the second time, and also waved at the police and beat them, so that their clothes were torn. For a time, the order was chaotic. Later, Xiangchang Song Zhaozhen came out and shouted at the villagers to retreat, so that a major disaster was avoided.</p>

<h3>Opposing the Transfer of the Three Academies to County Ownership</h3>
<p>The Southeast Township Academy and the Shazhou Academy of the West Township Public Office were called test halls in the scientific era of the Qing Dynasty. Among them, the land property of the Southeast Township Academy is the richest. The sand and Cao fields total more than 6,000 mu, and the annual rent is about 20,000 yuan, which is purely academic property. Recently, Xu Zhengji, Wang Zhonglin, Zhou Yuxin, and other overseas academics advocated that at a time when the county's education funds are exhausted, the salaries of primary school teachers in the county are in arrears for more than half a year. In order to concentrate the education property, they telegraphed the Department of Education, ordering the county to transfer all the funds of the three academies to the Education Bureau for management in order to enrich the education expenses. Later, Qian Xiaozhen, Jiang Gengbai, and other travelers from the Southeast Township in Beijing believed that the academic property was entirely private property, donated to the public property of each township. Public to the 26 townships is different from public to the entire county. They specially telegraphed the provincial department, vowing to fight to the death against the transfer to county ownership. It is heard that provincial inspectors Yi Jianlou and Ruan Zhidao have made a detailed statement of their opinions on this matter and submitted it to the Department of Education for submission to the Provincial Government for discussion.</p>

<h3>Giant Bandit Hang Da Lin Executed</h3>
<p>The giant bandit Hang Da Lin from the eastern countryside colluded with the bandits Huang Xiaogou and Chuan Haixiao, who had been executed last year, to rob Donghe and other places, committing numerous serious crimes. After the case was revealed, he changed his name to Hang Hongfan and hid in the Water Police Team as a patrolman. Unexpectedly, the net of heaven was so vast and sparse, and Hang suddenly returned to his village and was discovered by the victim Hang Fuqing. He was then reported to the policing station in Zhaliuqiao and the bandit was arrested and sent to the county. After repeated interrogations, he confessed without hesitation. County Magistrate Guo telegraphed the province for instructions. Now, he has received an electric telegram from the Provincial Government approving the death penalty. He was brought to the case at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to verify his identity, tied up, and taken to the execution ground to be shot.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Construction Bureau Undertakes Repairs to the Jiangnan Seawall</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Seawall is the guarantee of life and property for dozens of coastal counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In Jiangsu, the seawalls of Shishan, Changzhou, Taicang, and Songjiang are the most critical. A major repair project was undertaken last year, but due to limited funding, only a portion was completed. This autumn, repeated typhoon and tidal wave impacts have caused further damage in many places. The newly appointed Director of the Construction Bureau, Mr. Shen Baixian, personally inspected the damage. It is now reported that technicians Lin Baoyuan and Gu Houxi have been dispatched to various locations to conduct thorough investigations and propose plans for a major repair project to request funding from the central government. Recently, the Executive Yuan also received a telegram from Wang Qingmu and others reporting the critical condition of the seawall and forwarded it to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for investigation and handling. The following is a record of the reply from Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government: (Omitted earlier) "After the major repair plan is formulated and an accurate estimate is obtained, a request will be submitted for review and approval, and funding will be granted."</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Issues Scholarships</h3>

<h3>Northward Relocation of Yutong Impacts Yangzhou City</h3>
<p>Locals Zhu Dazai and others, due to the news that the Yangzhou Yutong Salt Manufacturing Company is planning to relocate to Chengang, fear that if this precedent is set, the other six companies will follow suit, significantly impacting the Yangzhou city market. They specially sent a telegram to Chen Xiangchen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, and Pan Songping, representative of the creditors, urging them to postpone the relocation, stating that the company's location has been designated by the ministry and cannot be moved arbitrarily. Furthermore, the company's salt business has a close relationship with the local area. Once it is moved, there will be many repercussions. Moreover, the Yangzhou city market has always relied on the salt industry. Looking at the present compared to the past, it has already declined significantly. They are trying to revitalize it without delay. If it is further damaged, it will be impossible to recover. How have the people of Yangzhou wronged Yutong that Yutong must resort to such cruel measures to push down the market? If other companies follow suit and relocate northward, then Yangzhou, known for its prosperity, will be even more unimaginable. The impact is too great. Therefore, it is telegraphed to request postponement of the northward relocation, which is not only fortunate for the locality but also a blessing for the people.</p>

<h3>Call for Tax Increase on Huai Salt</h3>
<p>The coastal counties of northern Huai produce abundant salt. Previously, merchants transporting salt through the six piers paid a tax of four yuan and one jiao and seven fen per dan, and merchants transporting salt through the five piers paid a tax of three yuan and six jiao per dan. After the Huaibei Audit Branch, following the order of the Ministry of Finance, increased the salt tax by one yuan per dan for the six piers and by one yuan and five jiao per dan for the five piers, the general merchants were greatly alarmed. Therefore, recently, merchants selling salt in Suixu Pi and Huaisi six counties and merchants selling in Dongguan Gan Shu Lian five counties jointly petitioned the Huaibei Salt Industry Association, requesting it to forward the petition to the ministry to waive the tax increase, alleviating the merchants' difficulties and alleviating the people's hardships.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Kong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Central Finances, Which Are Now Under Control; Military and Political Expenses for This Month Have Been Secured; Every Effort Will Be Made to Maintain Credit at Home and Abroad; There Is No Need to Seek Loans from Banks Recently</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, returned to Shanghai by overnight train from the east at 7:30 yesterday morning. He then met with former Finance Minister Song Ziwen and others at his residence on Xiai Xiansi Road, went to the Central Bank for office work at 11:00, and spoke with the press, stating that the central finances are now under control and the military and political expenses for this month have been secured. It is learned that Mr. Kong is scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow and be officially sworn into office on the morning of the 6th. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen and Others Visited Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mr. Kong immediately returned to his private residence on Xiai Xiansi Road to rest. Former Finance Minister Song Ziwen drove to visit him at 9:45, discussed matters for about an hour, and then departed. Visitors who came later included: Bei Songsun, Manager of the Bank of China; Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the National Economic Commission's Cotton Control Committee; Qin Runqing; Zeng Rongfu; and Zou Bingwen, among others. Mr. Kong went to the Central Bank around 11:00 to handle important official matters and did not return to his residence for lunch until 1:00 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Mr. Kong Scheduled to be Sworn into Office</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Kong met with the press at the Central Bank and said that the date of his swearing-in ceremony has been set for the 6th (next Monday), so he will take the overnight express train to Nanjing on Sunday evening. Chairman Lin originally planned to return to Nanjing on the 5th, but the Central Government received a telegram from him yesterday, postponing his departure until the 7th. Therefore, Mr. Lin will not be able to return in time to supervise the swearing-in ceremony, which will be represented by President Wang.</p>
<h3>Central Finances Are Now Under Control</h3>
<p>The difficulties of the central finances are well known. The annual military and political expenses have always been short, but the amount of the shortfall varies, depending on the amount of tax revenue. The funds for this month have already been secured without any problems. Whether to continue borrowing from the banking sector in the future is not currently necessary. In short, I have a way to handle the central finances. The details are still difficult to disclose. The two vice ministers of finance, the political vice minister will still be Zou Lin, and the permanent vice minister Li ____shen Wei, who could not be persuaded to stay, has been decided to be promoted to Qin Fen.</p>
<h3>Efforts Will Be Made to Eliminate Exorbitant Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies</h3>
<p>Mr. Kong continued, "I am from Shanxi. When I was in my hometown, my family had many silver shops and draft banks. I am a businessman by origin and have a deep connection with the business community, so I am deeply aware of the pain of the business and industrial sectors. Therefore, all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies that harm businesses and the people should be carefully investigated and eliminated. The primary task is to alleviate the pain of businesses and the people. Now that I have been appointed to head the Ministry of Finance, I am determined to proceed with the previous policy and do my best to protect industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>International Credit Will Be Vigorously Maintained</h3>
<p>I have been engaged in social work for more than ten years and have always valued personal credit. Now that I head the Ministry of Finance, I should value the nation's credit even more than personal credit, and ensure that it is not harmed in the slightest. This is with respect to domestic affairs. Furthermore, China's foreign credit has been significantly affected by the non-payment of foreign debts for many years. However, under the current global recession, all countries have been unable to repay their foreign debts, which is not unique to China. Now that our country is engaged in construction and urgently needs foreign investment, we should make every effort to maintain and even increase international credit," he said.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen to Leave Shanghai for a Short Trip</h3>
<p>When former Finance Minister Song left Mr. Kong's residence yesterday morning, he told reporters that he was currently busy with the handover and that he had not yet decided whether to continue serving as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council. He plans to leave Shanghai for a short trip after the handover is completed, and has not yet decided whether to go to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>Anchuan Goods in Wanxian Unimpeded; Foreign Vessels Abandon Wanxian</h3>
<p>After the Communist bandit Xu Xiangqian occupied Xuan Sui, he wanted to cross the Jialing River and go east, intending to capture Wanxian and unite with the Communist bandits on the border of Hubei and Sichuan to block Dongchuan. Last week, the situation in Wanxian was very tense, so the Sichuan merchants telegraphed Shanghai to stop handling Sichuan goods. Recently, after the arrival of the large army sent by Liu Xiang to Wan, people's hearts were slightly settled, and goods in Wanxian can be transported slightly. However, the upstream Chinese ships have been completely requisitioned for military transport. The situation regarding this matter and the negotiations between the Sichuan authorities and foreign vessels on resuming navigation to Wanxian have been clarified by this reporter and are described separately below.</p>
<h3>All Upstream Chinese Vessels Halted</h3>
<p>Chinese merchant ships sailing upstream of the Yangtze River between Yichang, Chongqing, and Shanghai and Chongqing have been requisitioned by Liu Xiang since the beginning of the month when Wanxian was tight to transport troops. Only a few ships of the Minsheng Company were left operating between Yichang and Chongqing. Later, due to the eastward movement of the large provincial army, the transportation ships were insufficient, and all the ships of the Minsheng Company were requisitioned for dispatch. As a result, all Chinese river vessels on the upper Yangtze line have now been completely suspended. When the Xiang team was in tension, he also planned to lease foreign merchant ships to load troops. Jardine expressed sympathy, but it was abandoned because Jiejiang did not agree.</p>
<h3>People's Hearts in Wanxian Gradually Stabilize</h3>
<p>Wanxian experienced a major panic from October 23rd. Sichuan merchants suspended the transportation of goods. Recently, the 5th Division and the 3rd Division of the 21st Army of the Provincial Army have successively arrived. The military strength in Wanxian has exceeded 20,000, and people's hearts have settled down. At present, the place where the Provincial Army is fighting with the Communist bandits is still in the area of Qiligan between Xuanhan and Suiding, so eastern Sichuan and downstream areas are relatively peaceful. Merchants' goods can be slightly circulated under the protection of the army.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Merchants Telegraph to Handle Goods</h3>
<p>After the Sichuan merchants stopped handling Shanghai goods in the first ten days of the month, goods going to Yiwanyu from Shanghai, such as large quantities of cotton yarn and piece goods, were all blocked and retained in Shanghai, piled up in various stacks. Recently, after the arrival of the Provincial Army in Wan, the Sichuan merchants have telegraphed to Shanghai, saying that Wanxian can be guaranteed to be safe. All the goods that were stopped some time ago and the goods needed for urgent circulation in the market can be transported in moderation, but large quantities of goods should be postponed. Therefore, the Jindang of Taikoo and the ships of Jiejiang Company have already transported goods to Sichuan in the past two days. At present, only British and American foreign merchant ships are sailing in the rivers of Sichuan. From the 16th of this month, the freight for piece goods will increase by two yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Foreign Vessels Do Not Go to Wanxian</h3>
<p>Wanxian is an important way to enter Sichuan. A lot of goods go from Shanghai. A large amount of tung oil in Sichuan is also loaded onto ships from that port. Therefore, since the Wanxian massacre, the local Sichuan merchants have refused foreign vessels to go to that port for many years, so the Taikoo Jardine and other ships sailing in the Sichuan River cannot rely on Wanxian to load and unload passengers and goods. In the past, when Yang Sen was in charge of Sichuan's government, he negotiated with foreign merchants for seven hundred thousand yuan in fines to be approved for restoration. This matter was shelved invisibly until today. Recently, after Liu Xiang unified Sichuan, he raised the issue of resuming foreign vessels' navigation to Wanxian and negotiated with British shipping companies. He approved the resumption of sailing. Last month, Liu Xiang sent a representative to Shanghai to discuss with Taikoo Jardine and others. If British merchants can pay 100,000 yuan in taxes, they can be approved to sail to Wanxian, but British merchants say that British ships will not go to Wanxian for tung oil, and Chinese ships have no oil tanks, so oil merchants will have to transfer to Yichang to load their ships for convenience. Therefore, they decided to ignore the matter of paying taxes and sailing to Wanxian and expressed their abandonment of Wanxian.</p>
<h3>Dong Kang to Go to Japan to Lecture on the 8th; He Was Formally Invited by the Japanese Legal Community; Yuan Tongli Will Also Go from Peiping at the Same Time; The Period is About Two Months or May Need to be Extended</h3>
<p>Central News Agency said, Legal scholar Dong Shoujing will go to Japan to lecture at the invitation of Japanese jurists and universities on the 8th of this month. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited Dong at his private residence yesterday. Dong was engrossed in writing in his study. The reporter waited quietly for a moment and was immediately granted the following conversation.</p>
<h3>Process of Contact</h3>
<p>The reporter first asked Mr. Dong about the motivation for going to Japan to lecture and the process of contact. He replied that Dr. Matsumoto Juji in Japan and Murakami Sadakichi, a former Shanghai lawyer in Shanghai, contacted me many times and sent long letters detailing that Japanese universities such as Teikoku, Waseda, and Meiji are eager for me to go to lecture on ancient Chinese legal systems. Because they also have a Chinese Legal System Research Association that is quite interested in the study of Chinese legal systems. I originally planned to leave around January next year, but they said that the weather would be too cold if it was delayed, and urged me to go immediately, so it has been decided to start on the 8th of this month. The period is about two months, or it may be extended.</p>
<h3>People Going Together</h3>
<p>Mr. Dong also said that in addition to myself starting directly from Shanghai, Yuan Tongli (i.e., Yuan Shouhe, Deputy Curator of the Peiping Library) will also go. However, Yuan will go to Japan from Peiping. Yuan and I have arranged to meet in Tokyo. Therefore, I have the mission of investigating cultural undertakings such as education and libraries in Japan. I have also contacted the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Education properly. As for those who will cross the East China Sea with me, there are also two secretaries, Sun Yizhai and Yang Wuyang. Mr. Yang is good at poetry. This trip can be used to chant and harmonize with the Japanese literary world. I have many old friends in the Japanese political, legal, educational, and literary circles. I have not seen each other for a long time. In addition to lecturing, there will be a lot of socializing this trip.</p>
<h3>Content of Lectures</h3>
<p>The Japanese legal community has asked me to give lectures on three topics: (1) The criminal law system in China during the Spring and Autumn period; (2) The difference between Chinese criminal law and etiquette; (3) A study of the centralization of power and the decentralization of power in Chinese history. If these three topics are fully lectured, it will take a long time, and I am afraid that it will not be finished in two days. This is about the old side of our country. As for the new law, their country has done in-depth research, which is far better than our country's current administrative law. The situation, such as the examination system, the supervision system, and the trend of legislation in our country, and the training of judicial officials, must be discussed. I deeply feel that in the way of learning, the four words "reviewing the old and knowing the new" are the most important. If you want to know the new, you must review the old. This trip is indeed for reviewing the old, but at the same time, it can also be used to know the new.</p>

The office has assigned Mr. Wang Yulun to discuss the matter with the association and stipulated the following measures: (1) (Weight) The weight of each box of goods, including the skin, is limited to 120 kilograms (equivalent to 200 jin on the scale).

<h3>Associated Press New Manager Morris Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Morris, the newly appointed Far East manager of the Associated Press of America, and his wife and daughter, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the Nagasaki Maru. Mr. Morris used to be the manager of the Japanese Advertising Report. After entering the Associated Press, he served in New York and Washington before succeeding as the manager of the Associated Press in Mexico City for several years. He has now been transferred from Mexico City to Shanghai to take charge of Far East communications. He stayed in Japan for two weeks on this trip, so he came to Shanghai by ship from Japan. Ma Xilu, the former manager of the Shanghai Associated Press, will go to Tokyo to serve as the manager of the Associated Press of Japan at the end of this month. Fugen, the former Far East manager of the Associated Press, will also return to the United States on the 5th of next month.</p>
<h3>Shoddy Goods Are Refurbished and Sold to the Interior; Shantou Tax Bureau Sends Letter to Machine Joint Association to Demand Goods for Prevention</h3>
<p>The Shantou Imported Foreign Cloth Piece Goods Transfer Tax Collection Bureau sent a letter to the Machine Joint Association yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir, it has long been heard that your association has been organized for many years, and its achievements have been praised by China and foreign countries. Since the September 18th Incident, the import of Japanese goods into our country has almost disappeared. However, the Japanese are cunning and are good at inducing our country's merchants to cooperate for profit, rebranding Japanese goods with Chinese Shanghai-made national product trademarks. Patriots or agencies in distant places do not understand the truth and cannot recognize them. Your association is the hub of the Shanghai National Products Association. It is expected that there are samples of products from textile factories in various countries. Now, our bureau is very eager to identify national products and collect samples of national product cloths, but I don't know if your association has this kind of cloth samples to send for recognition." The Machine Joint Association replied, "Dear Sir, I have received your letter, etc., for approval. Our association is currently collecting patterns from all national product factories in Shanghai, classifying and compiling 100,000 copies of national product samples for printing, which are expected to be published this year. At that time, we will notify the distribution department to present ten copies for the purpose of distinguishing national products from foreign products when collecting taxes. Now, we will send ten copies of the initial trademark, which were compiled and printed after the September 18th Incident, by separate mail for your bureau's reference at any time. A letter is hereby prepared and sent, hoping that you will check and accept it."</p>
<h3>Renaming of the Two Roads Aircraft Postponed</h3>
<p>Lin Wojiang told the Central News Agency reporter, "The naming of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo two-road airplanes was originally scheduled for the 12th. The bureau has also begun preparations and sent a letter requesting our association to send personnel to assist. The Association considered that the Huangpu aircraft was also scheduled to be held in Nanjing on that day, and it would be difficult to take care of both places, so it replied requesting postponement. Yesterday afternoon, Chen Chengshi, Yuan Boyang, and Li Dasan, the three members of the preparatory committee for the naming ceremony of the Two Roads aircraft, came to the meeting and discussed with me. As a result, it was changed to 2:00 pm on the 18th, and the location is still at Hongqiao Airport."</p>
<h3>Islamic Organizations Telegraph the National Government Requesting Severe Punishment for Jin Shuren and Zhang Fengjiu; Trial by a Special Tribunal Organized by the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Chinese Hui Cultural Promotion Association, the Shanghai Islamic Youth Association, the Chinese Islamic Association, and the Shanghai Branch sent a telegram to the National Government yesterday, stating: "Respectfully to the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Supervisory Yuan Judicial Administration Department: It is reported that Jin Shuren, the former chairman of Xinjiang and border defense commissioner, was recently arrested in Nanjing. The judicial authorities have been ordered to file charges and punish him according to law. This shows the central government's intention to rectify discipline. Jin betrayed Xinjiang for more than ten years without any achievements to speak of. His inferior deeds are obvious and well-known, such as colluding with foreigners, arbitrarily concluding treaties, alienating Han and Hui, causing unprecedented turmoil, greed, brutality, and countless malpractices, all kinds of crimes that harm the country and the people. It is difficult to count them all. Because Xinjiang is far away on the frontier, and the central government cannot reach it, it has been repeatedly deceived, which eventually led to the current situation in Xinjiang. It is due to Jin's actions. Moreover, his representative in Nanjing, Zhang Fengjiu, has fueled the flames, and his crimes are even more numerous. He has now escaped to Shanghai and is hiding in the concession. We respectfully request that the central government send personnel to investigate and arrest Zhang Fengjiu and extradite him for investigation and trial, and request that the judicial authorities seriously investigate the evidence of Jin Shuren and others' violations of the law, organize a special tribunal by the central government to try Jin Shuren and Zhang Fengjiu together, and impose the death penalty to correct the national law and rectify discipline. We are overwhelmed with anxiety and awaiting orders. In addition to sending telegrams separately, we respectfully present this: Chinese Hui Cultural Promotion Association, Shanghai Islamic Youth Association, Chinese Islamic Association Shanghai Branch, Winter"</p>

Since the Guild Hall's arguments are unreasonable and it has nothing to say, it has changed its methods, avoiding answering direct questions and instead engaging in widespread publicity in the press, sending letters with sophistry in an attempt to deceive the public. We fear that if we continue to tolerate this, the general public will be misled, right and wrong will be confused, and the future of national products will be difficult. We cannot but solemnly denounce this to clear up the confusion. We hereby refute the letter sent by the Guild Hall to your newspaper yesterday, one by one, as follows. We hope that you will publish it to uphold justice. We are extremely grateful. (1) The Guild Hall's original letter stated, "The Yong Sheng Tai Customs Brokerage has no specific contract with the Guild Hall and automatically sent a telegram to return the goods. How can it be said that we ordered them to do so? Even if the brokerage acted at the request of our Guild Hall, it was out of sympathy, unable to bear to see the Guild Hall being oppressed by capitalists and going bankrupt, and made an unfair outcry." Whether the Guild Hall has a specific contract with Yong Sheng Tai is a private matter between the Guild Hall and Yong Sheng Tai. Since the two parties are unwilling to expose their shortcomings, outsiders cannot obtain it. However, the key issue here is not whether there is a contractual fact, but whether there is a cooperative behavior. Why did the customs brokerage dare to send a telegram to Fuzhou to stop the consignee from taking delivery of the goods without the request of the original shipper? This is what the Guild Hall should clearly state. Furthermore, the Guild Hall, knowing that it cannot conceal it, voluntarily evaded the issue in the original letter, saying, "Even if the brokerage acted at its request, it was out of sympathy, unable to bear to see the Guild Hall being oppressed by capitalists, and made an unfair outcry," etc. Whether our Association is being used by capitalists and whether it has ever exerted pressure on others is not only not defended on paper, but there are also past facts to prove it. Our Association organized the China National Products Introduction Center, whose greatest goal is to facilitate the procurement of national products by people all over the country and to be a mediating agency for communication between producers and sellers. Although there are various reasons why national products cannot compete with foreign goods, the most important reason is that the value of the same goods is higher. In industrially backward countries, due to technical reasons of production, the resulting products face setbacks under the dumping policies of foreign goods. This is naturally a difficult process that developing countries must go through to develop national products. However, in addition to external pressure, if inland stores purchasing national products must rely on the so-called "gang brokers" when purchasing goods from Shanghai factories, and the purpose of the brokers is to profit, they will inevitably engage in considerable exploitation during the transfer, causing the national products to be higher than the factory price when they reach stores in various ports. Merchants in various ports have long been suffering from the monopoly of the brokers and have no way to eliminate it. Since the establishment of our Association's National Products Introduction Center, since the expenses are all allocated by the government, there is no membership fee burden for each member. Although it occupies an intermediary position between buyers and sellers, it will never extract exploitation to supplement its funds, so that national products stores in various places can purchase goods at low prices and sell them at low values. Directly, it can compete with foreign goods, and indirectly, it can also slightly reduce the burden of public purchase. However, since the business of our Association at the time of introduction takes the interests of merchants and people throughout the country as a prerequisite, a very small number of people who uphold private interests will inevitably have nothing to rely on. The Sanshan Guild Hall is a certain group of gang brokers, whose position is completely different from that of our Association. Moreover, the expenses burden, such as the so-called collection of "incense money," etc., must be passed on to merchants in various ports. Once the establishment of our Association's Introduction Center deprives it of its decades of borrowing, its struggle as a trapped beast is inevitable. However, the general trend is that the exploitative class must eventually be eliminated. It is a pity that the Guild Hall has never realized its foolishness. Furthermore, the Guild Hall's gang brokers are entrusted by Fuzhou stores to purchase goods. Does the procurement of goods only include national products? Most of them are still foreign goods. How can they use "procuring national products for many years" to deceive the world? As for the so-called "customs brokerage acted at its request out of sympathy, etc.," it is tantamount to the Guild Hall making its own accusations. Customs brokerage takes customs declaration for various stores as its business. It regards the Sanshan Guild Hall and the Introduction Center as its customers. However, at this moment, the dark forces of the Sanshan Guild Hall are strong. For business considerations, it is unwilling to favor our Association and lose the favor of large customers. Its business is completely different from that of gang brokers. How can there be a feeling of rabbit dying and fox grieving? (2) The Guild Hall stated, "The Sanbei Company rejected the application because the Introduction Center altered the opening order and reported the shipment." This is a fabricated story, which shows the clumsiness of its rumor-mongering techniques. This time, the Introduction Center entrusted the Sanbei Company to transport goods to Fuzhou. Manager Yu of the company formally stated that he could not transport the goods without the permission of the Sanshan Guild Hall. Therefore, the customs declaration was not issued at that time. The Introduction Center's list has not yet been seen. Where can it be altered? How can it be shipped to the Sanbei steamer and rejected? (3) The Guild Hall accused the Introduction Center of competing with gang brokers for business since its establishment, hoping to profit from the country and steal people's jobs. Since the establishment of the Introduction Center, although it has gradually established branches in Chongqing, Fuzhou, Hankou, and other ports, it has not been able to fully develop due to various obstacles from evil forces. As for competing with gang brokers for business and hoping to profit, our Association is based on principles, and the Association and the Introduction Center have fixed expenses. It does not take money from member factories and merchants in other ports, so that new factory products can be sold smoothly in other ports, and merchants can meet the market demand. If it is said that "selling national products cheaply and popularizing them to the general public has stolen the jobs of Fuzhou gang brokers," and hopes to use this to appeal to society and arouse sympathy, it is a true dream. How foolish it is!</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Sanshan Guild Hall has not been registered in accordance with the law and is not a formal legal entity. It also cleverly establishes the name of "incense money," which is no different from extracting donations according to the goods, which increases the cost of national products. This is extremely inappropriate. It is also heard that the Social Bureau of this city will formally ban it and order it to disband in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Sanshan Guild Hall, Fujian Representatives Host Press Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that Zhang Linong, Huang, Wu Hongsheng, Chen Shanbi, Huang Renfu, Huang Jiaxiang, Chen Runzhi, and other Fujian representatives in Shanghai hosted a press conference for the local press at the Sanshan Guild Hall on Fuzhou Road at noon yesterday. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Chen Runnan gave a welcome speech, and Huang Jiaxiang reported, saying in essence that Fujian has rejected the use of enemy goods and promoted national products for decades, with great achievements. This is not possible without the enthusiasm of merchants and the willingness of the people of Fujian to use them. However, the best-selling national products in Fujian have aroused the covetousness of politicians and financial magnates. This spring, the Shanghai National Products Introduction Center was organized, originally to guide the people and promote national products, with good intentions. Unexpectedly, politicians and financial magnates in our country jointly established a Fuzhou branch, nominally to introduce, but actually to sell. It expands the organization and implements monopolistic measures for goods that have already been sold, while national products that have not been recognized in the market and local products that have not been promoted in various places are not within its plans. For example, before the Renfeng bleached cloth was sold by the center, it was rumored that the factory was using the name of national products, but it was not actually national products, so that the stock of goods that Fuzhou stores had already defended could not be sold. After it was purchased and sold, the storm subsided. In August of this year, the people in the center formed a public sales office, intending to eliminate everything. The Sanshan Yicheng Society was deeply afraid of the disaster of overturning its bowl, and initiated negotiations. At the same time, in order to ensure the safety of the entire Sanshan Yicheng Society and to survive, it had to work hard. Therefore, it stated to various shipping companies that it could not cooperate with these people, and the various shipping companies maintained justice and agreed to provide assistance. Only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company changed its policy midway because of its close relationship with the Shanghai National Products Introduction Center. It has now reduced the shipping fee by 25%. Recently, the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association listened to the one-sided words of the National Products Introduction Center, fabricated facts, falsely accused our Guild Hall, obstructed the transportation of national products, and manipulated commerce, publishing it in newspapers in an attempt to destroy the reputation of our Guild Hall, so as to achieve its poisonous plan of monopolizing trade. We fear that various sectors will misunderstand the other party's malicious propaganda, so we specially invite you to uphold justice.</p>

<h3>Call for Help from Dinghai County Due to Wind Disaster</h3>
<p>The Dinghai County sent a letter to the Ningbo Fellow Association, saying: To the gentlemen of the Ningbo Fellow Association, we hereby state that Dingyi County, built on an island, consists of more than two hundred islands scattered in the ocean. The sea dikes along the coast are all man-made. Even a slight surge of wind and tide can directly hit them everywhere. This year, in September, two hurricanes and rainstorms caused extremely heavy damage to Dingyi County. It cannot be compared with other counties with only one or two coasts. According to the current investigation, 90% of the coastal dikes have collapsed. The disaster area is estimated to be one-third of the county's area, or about 200 square kilometers. The number of people affected by the disaster is estimated to be 20% of the county's population, or about 80,000 people. The area of cotton and rice fields flooded is estimated to be 20% of the county's land, or about 400,000 mu. The total cost of repairing dikes and walls, as well as the losses of cotton, rice, boats, timber, food, salt utensils, and salt, is no less than 3 million yuan. This is a rare disaster unseen for decades, even more serious than the autumn of 1920. We have already presented the above situation to the provincial government for sending officials to inspect and verify the facts, and have taken disaster footage, filled out forms, and reported the request for disaster relief. The urgent tasks to be carried out are: first, to repair the dikes to avoid repeated irrigation by salt tides and turning the land into wasteland; second, to relieve the disaster victims to prevent them from being forced into extreme poverty and turning to evil ways. In particular, the repair of dikes requires a huge amount of money. However, the provincial and county treasuries are empty. The funds allocated in the future will inevitably be small, like a drop in the bucket, which will not solve the problem. It is difficult for any official who comes to Dingyi County to be aware of this disaster shortly after taking office. While pleading for the people, one's strength is weak. We have always admired the gentlemen of your Association for their enthusiasm for public welfare and their concern for relief efforts. At this time of wounds and scars, we sincerely hope that you will show great compassion and raise huge sums of money to benefit the dike project and provide relief. We are extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Guild's Proposition on Silk Industry Control: First Seek the Absorption of Excess Domestic Purchases; No Other Way Than to Connect with the Silk Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>The Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Guild of this city is paying close attention to the Silk Industry Control Committee planned by the National Economic Committee, as the two are closely related. Mr. Gao Shiheng, standing committee member of the guild and deputy manager of the Mayar Silk Weaving Factory, recently expressed his views, saying that since Mr. Song Ziwen's return to China, the planning of our country's economic control has been proceeding step by step. The government has paid more attention to industry. Therefore, after the Cotton Industry Control Committee was formally established first, the planning of silk industry control is also said to be underway. It is hoped that the people will recover and prosper. However, silk is the raw material for silk weaving, so the silk industry and the silk weaving industry are closely related. Since the decline of the silk industry, the silk weaving industry has also felt great pain. Considering the current state of the silk industry, exports have fallen sharply, prices have fallen below cost, and the pressure from rayon has made it difficult to maintain the balance of production and sales with the current output. How can we hope to restore the golden age of the past? It is almost a dream. The output of raw silk in our country, including wild silkworm silk, is about 500,000 dan per year. At most, 250,000 dan are exported each year, and the remaining half is used for domestic consumption of silk fabrics. However, in recent years, exports have plummeted, and this year's exports are expected to be no more than 80,000 dan. The national output has not decreased significantly, so how can the more than 100,000 dan that are not exported be consumed? In the past three years, the increase in silk weaving machines in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has broken the history of the Chinese silk weaving industry. In Shanghai alone, the number of weaving machines has increased from more than 1,000 to more than 7,000, consuming nearly 30,000 dan of raw silk each year. Other places such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Shengze have also seen significant increases. Therefore, the consumption of raw silk is directly proportional to the number of weaving machines. In other provinces such as Guangdong, Shandong, and Sichuan, the production of silk fabrics has also increased considerably. Therefore, what has been reduced in exports has fortunately been absorbed by the domestic silk weaving industry. Otherwise, the decline of the silk industry would be even worse than it is today, and it would be even more unbearable to hear about. The reasons for the failure of the silk industry are nothing more than poor quality, high production costs, and inability to compete with Japanese silk. The United States is the largest market in the world for raw silk, and Japanese silk is always available in New York in tens of thousands of dan for silk factories to choose from. If you want to buy from China, it will take two months to deliver the goods. In commercial competition, everything changes in an instant. Why should they abandon the near and seek the far? Who would believe that Chinese silk is not failing? However, our country's silk industry is not without people who are fighting hard. For example, the recent improvement of silkworm eggs in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been well received by farmers. Yongtai Silk Factory in Wuxi and Hangzhou Silk Factory in Zhejiang have worked hard to manage their businesses, and their products have a good reputation abroad. However, the staff of general silk factories have no ability to improve the traditional organization. They only focus on speculation and have never heard of research on technology or work to save costs and improve products. When they are on the verge of danger, they are at a loss except for panic and cries for help. People with knowledge have long believed that the issuance of silk industry bonds will not help the situation, but most opinions believe that it is a life-saving medicine. After the issuance of this bond, the market situation has deteriorated even more, and the silk factories are dying more and more. Everyone is beginning to realize that if this four million dollars had been used to improve silkworm eggs, there might have been considerable benefits today. Therefore, if we do not thoroughly improve the silk industry, we will definitely work hard for nothing. The government must control it, unify its steps, have strength and backing, and then find a new source of life, and eliminate the general status quo that is not suitable for survival, then we may be able to reach a new stage and flourish. The control of the silk industry is nothing more than three key points: silkworm farming, silk reeling, and sales. The first two points are entirely technical issues. Even from the point of view of sales, it is of course hoped that the original business position overseas can be restored and the country can recover the leaks without waiting to be said. But, it is pitiful that our market has already been lost, and it will never be possible to recover it overnight. We must first improve and perfect silkworm farming and silk reeling before there is any hope. The urgent need at present is how to absorb the excess silkworm silk domestically before restoring foreign trade. The domestic silk weaving industry has suffered from the sharp drop in silk prices, and silk prices have also fallen sharply. The depth of its pain also makes it feel that it cannot protect itself. We hope that the silk industry will improve, and the silk weaving factories feel most difficult to purchase raw materials because of poor quality and unevenness. For example, to purchase 50 dan of raw materials, it is often necessary to purchase from five silk reeling families. The quality is inconsistent and the colors are uneven. For example, the quality of silk in Hangzhou is very different from that produced in Wuxi. Therefore, in the weaving process, it is very difficult to adjust, warp, weft, refine, and dye. The Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Guild previously had a cooperative plan for the purchase of raw materials by the industry, but it could not be realized due to the lack of opponents. Therefore, it is not easy to absorb the current excess silkworm silk. Moreover, foreign goods and fabrics are imported to the tune of 300 million yuan each year. Even the raw material cotton for domestic cotton cloth is mostly Indian and American cotton. These imported goods not only take away the position of our country's cotton cloth, but also take away the position of domestic silk fabrics. However, domestic silk fabrics are entirely produced by Chinese people, and every inch of silk produced can resist an inch of foreign cloth. In recent years, silk prices have been low, almost equal to cloth prices. Chinese people purchasing domestic silk is not extravagant or difficult. Therefore, if we talk about controlling the silk industry, if we first try to maintain the situation of domestic consumption of one-sixth of raw silk, then the silk industry will have a permanent way out. On the one hand, we will continue to make efforts in export trade, and it will be easy to achieve success. As for how to control domestic sales, it is necessary for the government to make strict plans, and the hemp and silk industry and the silk industry will first benefit from close contact. If production and sales can cooperate, there is no need to worry about the lack of control. It is heard that the guild has submitted this proposal to the National Economic Committee for adoption.</p>

<h3>Bullets Flying on Guangxi Road, Two Robbers, One Injured, One Captured: Three Robbers Rob a Cigarette and Exchange Shop in Broad Daylight; Detective Constables Quickly Surrounded Them After Receiving the News; One Robber Escaped, Two Robbers Were Surrounded; Gunshots Were Concentrated, One Injured, One Captured</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, a robbery occurred on Yunnan Road. At that time, the patrol constables followed closely and fought each other in Cide Lane on Guangxi Road. One robber escaped, one robber was captured alive, and one robber was shot and injured on the spot. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Rob</h3>
<p>Tai Xin Chang Ji Cigarette and Exchange Shop, located at No. 200, the diagonal opposite of the Tianchan Stage at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Fuzhou Road, was opened by Shen Xuhong (48 years old) from Changzhou for more than ten years. Because of its location in the center of the singing and dancing stage, its daily life is very good, and Shen has also accumulated some wealth because of this. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, three men in black gowns suddenly came outside the counter of the shop. One man came forward and said he wanted to buy cigarettes. At the same time, two other men opened the iron fence in front of the shop and rushed straight inside, each taking out a pistol to scare the shopkeeper, the counter, and the apprentices from making a sound. They went to the corner of the house and kept watch. The robber outside the counter was on the lookout in front of the store. Another robber sat on the counter, opened the cash register, and robbed dozens of silver dollars stored in the shop. They first withdrew and ran away. The two robbers on the lookout and on guard also left the store and fled into Fuxiang Lane on the north side of the shop.</p>
<h3>No Way Forward</h3>
<p>At that time, Shen Xuhong saw that the money had been robbed and saw that the robbers had escaped into Fuxiang Lane. He and his apprentice Wu Dahua chased after them one after another. They ran to the entrance of the lane and shouted to catch the robbers. Two Chinese constables from No. 433 and No. 3209 nearby heard the shouts and quickly followed the sound. After learning the situation, they drew their guns and chased into Fuxiang Lane. However, one end of the lane leads directly to Guangxi Road. When the three robbers saw that they were being chased, they ran out of Fuxiang Lane, crossed Guangxi Road, and fled into the opposite Cide Lane. When the two Chinese constables saw that they might escape, they quickly blew their whistles to warn the nearby patrol constables to surround them. At the same time, they also chased into Cide Lane together. However, one of the robbers, seeing that he was being chased closely from behind, ran in another direction when he ran out of Fuxiang Lane. Therefore, only two robbers escaped into Cide Lane. Seeing that the patrol constables were pressing closer step by step, they knew it would be difficult to move forward. They turned into the north lane of the lane, hoping to escape from there. However, the north lane was a dead end. Seeing that there was no way out, the robbers planned to turn back and run out.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle on Both Sides</h3>
<p>But at this time, the two Chinese constables had arrived and blocked the way. The robbers could not advance or retreat, and in desperation, they opened fire on the two constables. So the two constables also opened fire in retaliation. Suddenly, gunshots rang out in Cide Lane, bullets flew everywhere, and pedestrians were caught off guard and ran away in panic. After a fierce battle, one of the robbers was shot and fell to the ground by the two constables. Another robber, seeing that things were not good, threw away his pistol and surrendered. At this time, the patrol constables from all sides had also arrived and took the captured robbers and the two pistols to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Later, because the injured robber was seriously injured, he was sent to the police hospital for treatment. After a brief interrogation of the captured robber, it was said that the escaped robber was hiding somewhere in Zhabei. The police station notified the Public Security Bureau to escort him to be captured, but nothing was gained. The detective constables were immediately dispatched to pursue and arrest him. The injured robber was shot eight times, all in the legs and other parts, so the injuries were not serious.</p>

<p>The case of the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company in Yangjing Town, Pudong, requesting permission to enclose the old Xidu wharf, one of the eight long ferry crossings on the Huangpu River, was because the local people realized that the ferry crossing was an important outlet for travel between the north and south of Pudong. All of them went to the death to fight for it, causing the company to send workers several times to try to enclose it, but they stopped because more than a hundred women continued to resist. Seeing that things did not go as planned, the company petitioned the authorities for protection. At the same time, the company sent a large number of workers to start blocking the Xidu port, trying to cut off traffic. The workers were able to work, so although there were more than 100 peasant women in the morning who went to the scene several times to try to break into the factory and stop the work, they were rejected by force and retreated. After 4:00 p.m., the women from the four villages heard the news and were very angry. They held farming tools and rushed to help. They gathered more and more people, about five or six hundred people, all disregarding their lives and swarming forward, and it was impossible to stop them. As soon as this large number of women arrived at the factory, they pushed down and crushed all the walls that had been built. After half an hour, the destruction work was completed before they dispersed.</p>
<h3>When the Robbers Were Arrested, They Were Still Sleeping Soundly with Prostitutes; a Handgun Was Found in the Pile of Clothes; the Original Stolen Goods Were Found on the Roof</h3>
<p>Li Kunxin's house, a Ningbo native living at No. 6 Huaxing Lane, Yuezhou Road, was suddenly invaded by many robbers at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, and gold and silver jewelry worth 187 yuan were robbed and escaped. The Huishan Police Station was reported. Later, detectives Shen Binkui, Wang Fugen, Ji Peijin, and Zhao Yongqing learned that the robbers in the case were hiding in the Lao Xinfa Inn at No. 36 Edward Road. They secretly went to Room 13 at midnight, and the robbers Zhang Jinf, Ye Achang, He Jifen, and Shen Jinyuan (Ningbo Chongming and other places) were playing mahjong together, and they were immediately arrested. The original stolen gold bracelet was found on Zhang's right arm, and a pawn ticket was found next to him. Zhang Jinbao, an accomplice, was arrested in Room 17. A prostitute, Chen Fengxian, was sleeping with him. The original stolen beautiful handkerchief was found in Zhang's sleeve. After questioning, it was learned that the firearms were hidden in Zhang Jinfa's house at No. 82 Yad Road. The detectives rushed there and found a pistol, seven bullets, and one shell in the old clothes pile on the mezzanine floor of the kitchen in the house. The pistol was loaded with one bullet. Then, 40 bullets were found in a cloth bag. Zhang Jinbao also confessed that there were stolen gold jewelry circles, buttons, beads, silver chains, and other items hidden in the roof tiles of Room 13, which were also taken out and brought to the police station. The police chief released the prostitute Chen because she was not involved, and the rest were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, detailed the previous situation and presented the stolen goods and bullets for inspection and requested an extension for further investigation. According to the statement of the victim Li Chen, three robbers with pistols suddenly broke in at that time and threatened her not to make a sound. The defendant Zhang Jinbao forced her to open the jewelry box and took the ornaments presented in the case and escaped. The defendant Ye Afu was also present, but she did not see the rest. According to her husband Li Kunxin, he was responsible for running the customs at a foreign firm on Guangdong Road. He had just returned home at that time and was robbed of a watch and two silver dollars and six cents by the robbers with guns because he was too frightened to identify the faces of the robbers. After Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled for further verification. The stolen goods were first returned to the original owners to take away.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road Inspection Group Departs on Schedule</h3>

<h3>The Qualification for Registration of Sanitary Engineering Technicians and Deputy Technicians Is Broadly Defined</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utility Bureau handles the application for registration of sanitary engineering technicians and deputy technicians. The original qualifications stipulated that only those who have obtained the certificate of sanitary engineering technician and deputy technician issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are allowed to register. It is now heard that the bureau recently received an order from the Municipal Government, approving the consultation of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, regarding the qualifications of sanitary engineering technicians, because there is a great shortage of specialized talents in this field. For each part of the sanitary engineering department, various engineering technicians or deputy technicians who have been approved for registration by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce may be responsible for one part or several parts of the engineering that have considerable knowledge and experience in the department. Therefore, the bureau has now notified companies, firms, and individuals in the city that are engaged in sanitary engineering business to complete the registration procedures for sanitary engineering technicians and deputy technicians with the bureau before December 31 of this year.</p>

<h3>The Cigarette Exchange Industry Association Sends a Letter to the Chamber of Commerce Requesting to Exempt the Tooth Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Exchange Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the erroneous collection of taxes, saying, "We hereby inform you that our Shanghai South Branch Office has received a letter from Wanlongtai Cigarette Exchange Shop at Wangjia Wharf, a member of our association, reporting that our shop has been selling retail cigarettes for many years and has never extracted commissions for buying and selling on behalf of customers, and has never donated to receive a tooth tax certificate. It was horrified to receive a notice from the Shanghai Tooth Tax Collection Office on the 20th of last month, setting a deadline of three days to pay the tax and receive the certificate. After inquiring about the tooth type notice, the certificate listed is a tooth bank post from the previous Qing Dynasty, which is now set as a registration certificate. The period is divided into long and short. Those who set up a line to buy and sell on behalf of customers and collect commissions are called tooth households, and they should report to receive a certificate in accordance with the regulations. Our shop is actually selling retail, selling at a fixed price, and does not collect commissions from customers. There are also account books that can be checked. There is no need to receive a certificate. This shows that the tax collector's investigation and report are wrong. Please forward a letter to make a statement and attach a notice for cancellation. Mi Chuxin and Zhang Songji were sent to meet with Qu Puyi (ie Yiqi), the director of the office, to explain the situation and inquire about the detailed rules of the tooth tax. However, the director answered irrelevantly and gave no reason. The staff members believed that he was unreasonable and asked for a written reply, which was permitted, but no reply has been seen. Therefore, we hereby write to the association to prove that the shop does not have the nature of a tooth bank and cannot receive a certificate as an exception, in order to protect it and avoid disputes." The association has checked that the shop has been operating cigarette exchanges for dozens of years. It is actually selling cigarettes retail and is not buying and selling on behalf of customers, nor does it collect commissions. There is no need to pay tooth tax. We hereby write a special letter to explain the situation. We sincerely hope that the association will consider the difficulties of merchants and grant a letter to inform the Shanghai County Government to quickly stop the collection in order to ensure commerce and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3>National Goods Production and Sales Company Convenes Second Preparatory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Although it has only been a few days since the China National Goods Production and Sales United Company announced the public offering of shares on October 20, more than 5,000 letters have been received from all parties requesting articles of association, plans, and voluntarily paying shares to join as promoters. Moreover, because the deadline for soliciting promoters is too tight, some have acknowledged joining as promoters by flying letters and telegrams. It is now heard that the preparatory director of the company has set November 15 as the deadline for soliciting promoters and sponsors in accordance with the predetermined motion of the Fifth Promoters' Meeting on October 16. In addition to instructing the secretariat to issue a second announcement, it is also scheduled to convene the Second Preparatory Committee meeting today at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Issued an announcement: We hereby inform you that since the company announced the recruitment of shares, although it has only been ten days, patriotic people from all parties have enthusiastically subscribed to shares and requested to join as promoters and sponsors, which is very enthusiastic. In various remote provinces, there are also those who have requested to join by telegram due to the time limit. This shows that the heart of patriotism is not limited by location, and the plan to promote national power, production, and national salvation can be realized. According to the decision of the Fourth Promoters' Meeting on October 16, November 15 is set as the deadline for soliciting promoters and sponsors. In order to meet the request of various provinces to invest, it seems necessary to extend the deadline. It is scheduled to convene the Second Preparatory Committee meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 p.m. on the 4th of this month to discuss the outline for establishing banks in various provinces to collect shares and the outline for organizing branch companies and national goods warehouses, chain stores, etc. We sincerely hope that you will attend or send representatives to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Agenda: The agenda of the Second Preparatory Committee meeting is pre-recorded as follows: (A) Reporting matters: (1) Report on the enthusiastic participation of various parties in joining as promoters and voluntarily paying shares; (2) Report on the number of promoters and sponsors and the total amount of subscribed shares as of November 3; (3) Report on the progress of organizing the Design Research Committee and the Talent Training Committee; (B) Matters for discussion: (1) Establish share collection offices in various provinces; (2) Discuss the draft outline for organizing branch companies; (3) Discuss the draft outline for organizing national goods warehouses; (4) Discuss the draft outline for organizing reading schools.</p>
<h3>The French Authorities Reiterate the Prohibition of Gambling</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession authorities strictly prohibited gambling, it has been completely eradicated in the past two years. However, those who rely on gambling for a living are still trying their best to carry out activities in order to achieve their goals. There are even a few unscrupulous people who take advantage of this to set up scams. Recently, for example, Mr. Wang was fooled by an Austrian and cheated out of a large sum of money, which is one of them. Therefore, the French authorities issued a final warning, saying, "Since the prohibition of gambling in the French Concession, although it has been formally announced last year, some people have recently resumed major activities, hoping to open gambling dens in the French Concession, and have spent a lot of money to give to scammers, thinking that they can help them avoid police arrest. These scammers benefit from their honesty and steal their money. This kind of movement is illegal, criminal, and foolish. The authorities of this concession believe that it is necessary to warn the residents of the concession again to pay attention to prevention. Gambling dens are absolutely not allowed to be established in the French Concession. No one can be protected, and there is absolutely no place that can be protected from gambling. There is no place that can avoid police arrest. This is a definite and unchangeable matter. The authorities earnestly advise the residents that if anyone engages in this kind of activity, no matter what their position or nationality is, report it immediately without hesitation."</p>
<h3>A Dismissed Policeman Dies Suddenly After Serving His Sentence: The Local Security Officer Has Reported to the Court for Inspection</h3>
<p>Xu Changsheng, a Shandong native, was in his thirties. He used to be a patrolman in the first section of the seventh district of the Wusong Public Security Bureau. During his tenure, he rented a room from Gu Hongsheng at No. 37 Hujia Bridge and lived there with his wife. In the spring of this year, Xu and his wife were suspected of trafficking in people and were transferred by the Chuansha County Government. After questioning and making clear statements, Xu was sentenced to six months in prison. When the sentence expired, Xu went to Song and went to Gu Hongsheng's house to pack up his belongings and go to Chuansha, because his wife's sentence had not expired, so she was not released. Unexpectedly, Xu died suddenly yesterday morning because he did not have time to leave after arriving in Song. Gu Hongsheng reported to Zhao Maoqing, the security officer of the 32nd district in Shanghai, and asked the Shanghai Local Court to send someone to Wusong for inspection in order to collect the body.</p>
<h3>程硯秋訪問記</h3>
<p>Reflections on Improving Old Operas</p>
<p>Cherish the Old House Until the New One Is Built</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Yanqiu, the famous opera singer who returned from Europe in April of this year, has been rumored in newspapers to be performing in Shanghai. The reporter met with him yesterday at the Cangzhou Hotel. From the following short question-and-answer conversation, we can learn a snippet of his life and art. I said, "Master Cheng, this trip between Beijing and Shanghai is very tiring." Master Cheng replied with a slight smile, "I don't feel much. However, I really didn't want to come to Shanghai this time, but I came anyway. I think you probably already know the reason why I originally planned not to perform on stage for a year, but in terms of environment and human relations, it is not easy to fulfill my ideals. However, I feel very ashamed. Of the nineteen suggestions in my European travel report, apart from a few items related to the self-help of the opera world, which I have been trying my best to implement, the aspects related to the stage have not been as good as I wished due to environmental and economic reasons, despite putting in some effort. Moreover, regarding my own artistic skills, I feel that I haven't had any free time to sort them out." I said, "Master Cheng, these are excessively polite words." He said, "This is not politeness. Moreover, in this regard, on the one hand, I hope that I can have some free time in the future to continue my efforts, and on the other hand, I still hope that everyone will give me a lot of guidance. I know myself that a reform undertaking will never be successful by individual thinking and ability alone. The opera world is now in a very serious era, and reform cannot be delayed any longer. Fearing criticism and correction is like avoiding medical treatment when sick. But there is one point that I ask society to forgive. The current Peking Opera is like an old house. Although it urgently needs to be renovated, it must be protected until the new house is completely completed, because under this old house, there are many of our opera colleagues who rely on it for shelter, and a valuable old house that has been repaired may be more reliable than a new house that has been built with shoddy materials. This is my personal hope for the opera world and those who cherish the opera world." After Master Cheng finished speaking, I felt that this was enough for my interview, so I said "Goodbye," and I happily left Cangzhou.</p>

<p>According to Dagongshe, all striking workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company held a general meeting at the Republican Theater in Ximen at 9:00 am yesterday, decided to continue the strike, and elected representatives to petition the central government. All workers who were forcibly pulled into the factory by the company have already withdrawn. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Held a General Meeting of All Workers: The Fourth District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, believing that the company had no sincerity in resolving the dispute, specially convened a temporary general meeting of all workers at 9:00 am yesterday. More than 1,600 workers from both the old and new plants, as well as Lu Jingshi from the Municipal Party Department and Zhu Xuefan from the General Labor Union, attended to provide guidance. Zhu Haosen, Yang Zhaogen, Bao Defu, Xu Hongsheng, Zhang Amu, and others were publicly elected as the presidium. First, the chairman reported on the process of the strike and the mediation efforts of various parties. Then, representatives from higher levels addressed the meeting, praising the workers' spirit of strictly observing order and fighting peacefully, and hoping that they would continue to maintain power generation so that society would not suffer unexpected losses. Immediately afterwards, the following resolutions were passed: (1) The company has no sincerity, and all workers are determined to continue the strike. They vow not to resume work until their goals are achieved. (2) During the strike period, if there are saboteurs or those who are taken advantage of and cause trouble, and if the company recruits new workers, they should be severely punished. (3) Zhu Haosen, Jiang Zhengming, Chen Youfa, and Cao Dequan were designated to go to Beijing on a regular basis to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry. The meeting adjourned after shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Workers Who Were Pulled In Withdraw: According to a statement from a person in charge of the workers' side whom the Dagong reporter met yesterday, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, seeing that work in all departments had come to a standstill since the workers went on strike, ordered Chinese and foreign engineers to take cars to the residences of workers at dawn on the 30th and 31st to forcibly pull workers into the factory, falsely claiming that workers in a certain department had already resumed work and that if they did not return to the factory, they would be fired. Only after the workers entered the factory did they realize that they had been deceived. They refused to work because the dispute had not been resolved. Despite the factory's repeated persuasion, they remained unmoved. Subsequently, some of the workers who had been pulled in found ways to withdraw on their own and reported the process to the labor union. Until yesterday, all the workers who had been pulled in had left the factory.</p>

<h3>Robbers Brutally Injure Victim, Insult Bride, Husband Shoots Himself</h3>

<h3>Hall Case Still Needs Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the Greater America Evening Post, the case of American aviator Leier being accused of defrauding General He Zhuguo of money to purchase handguns continued to be heard in the American Consular Court this morning (3rd). Consular Judge Pandi immediately declared, "I cannot believe the details you have provided. However, whether Hall's statements can be substantiated depends on the receipt given to Hall by the German who privately trafficked in arms. According to the testimony, this receipt is now in the hands of the Japanese authorities. Therefore, Judge Pan has not yet pronounced a verdict and will investigate with the Japanese authorities before making a final decision." According to Hall's testimony, the German's surname was Pi, and his given name was Feide. He privately trafficked in arms. He only acted as an intermediary at the request of General He Zhuguo. General He did not have a government passport, so he wanted to find a way to smuggle the arms into the country. After receiving a promissory note for 9,775 yuan from General He, he sent it to the German and agreed to deliver the goods and receive payment in Shanghai. However, the German returned the promissory note and came to Tianjin, wanting cash. He discounted the promissory note at the bank and exchanged it for gold coins. After seeing a letter from Germany stating that the goods had been shipped, he delivered the gold coins to the German and obtained a receipt. He believed that taking the round-the-world route would be faster, so he took a route from Tianjin via Kobe to Dalian to receive the arms. When he arrived at Moji, he was arrested by the Japanese police. He went to Kobe to say goodbye to his wife, who was returning to the United States, and was then escorted back to Tianjin. He recently telegraphed Japan, requesting the return of the confiscated documents, but there has been no result. However, Hall has consistently failed to provide evidence of innocence, so the court is currently waiting to verify the receipt he provided before making a ruling.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: According to Mr. Wei Yuming, the party concerned, he read in the *Shen Bao's* local news column yesterday a report about the Kenye Bank cracking a theft case, which stated, "Wei Yuming, a tea room worker on the Ning Shao Steamer No. 2, was apprehended at the entrance of Da Cheng Li," which is obviously inconsistent with the facts and may be a misunderstanding of hearsay. I have never been arrested by the Public Security Bureau or any other agency. However, it is true that the Shanghai Local Court summoned me to testify. Now that the investigation has concluded, a decision has been made not to prosecute. In order to protect my reputation, I specifically ask your esteemed lawyer to send a letter to correct this statement. I hereby respectfully request that you correct the statement. Respectfully, Lawyer Zhu Dianqing, November 3.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have just seen in yesterday's local news column of your esteemed newspaper a report about a dispute between the abbot and monks of the Guoen Temple over the management of temple property, which records the content entirely based on the plaintiff's one-sided testimony in court. The defendant, Monk Kaisheng’s, reasons for defense were not addressed because the case was adjourned. Therefore, the factual record is biased and entirely based on attacks and accusations. The Guoen Temple was built independently in Shanghai by the late Elder Monk Zhican during the eighth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. After Monk Zhican's death, Monk Kaisheng, his disciple, inherited the position of abbot. The temple is one of the four major monasteries in Shanghai and is not a branch of the P陀紫竹林. Nor is there any fact that the abbot was appointed by the P陀紫竹林. In August of the year before last, after the abbot of the Zizhu Forest, Monk Guangde, passed away, the responsibilities were immense, and no one was in charge. At that time, all the monks of the Zizhu Forest sent a letter to Shanghai, publicly inviting Monk Kaisheng to take over the position. Monk Kaisheng, because he valued the Buddhist site, felt it was his duty and had no choice but to accept the difficult task, as evidenced by the public letter from all the monks of the monastery. Later, because Monk Kaijue forcibly occupied the Chao Yin Cave and did not listen to the control of the Zizhu Forest over the years, he did not abide by the rules of the monastery after coming to Shanghai. Monk Kaisheng, because he was the abbot of the Zizhu Forest, felt responsible and unable to stop it, and also unable to stand idly by, so he reported it to the Shanghai Buddhist Association in accordance with the rules of the monastery. The association sent him to the Youmin Xiqin Institute for repentance to encourage correction. These facts are obvious to all and there are files to prove it. Whether there was a design to lure and deceive is not difficult to find out. Now that the case is in court, right and wrong will be judged by law. However, the newspaper's publication of Kaijue's one-sided testimony before the case is decided is misleading and tarnishes the reputation of Buddhism. In addition to sending a letter to Kaisheng regarding the newspaper's record through our lawyers, we are sending a letter on his behalf, briefly stating the facts of the case, hoping that your newspaper will publish the letter for correction, so as to clarify the truth and avoid false rumors. This would be an immeasurable act of kindness. Respectfully, Lawyers Li Fengshen and Yuan Xilian, November 3.</p>
<p>I have just read the report "Northwest Intermodal Transport Opens" on page 21 of your newspaper on October 25, and there are inconsistencies with the facts: (1) The Dapu Wharf of our railway is still open to traffic and has not been abandoned. (2) The joint water and land transport between our railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is specifically for the purpose of accommodating seagoing vessels with deeper drafts. A temporary wharf was built at the Sunjiashan Station for transshipment, not the Lao Yao Wharf, as that wharf is a huge project that cannot be completed in a short period of time. The above two items are closely related to the export of goods from our railway. It is hoped that you will investigate and correct these errors on our behalf. Respectfully, Vehicle Department, Longhai Railway Administration, October 30.</p>

<p>Special Fashion Issue, No. 9</p>
<h3>The Evolution of the Cheongsam</h3>
<p>— You Xing</p>
<p>Dressing and eating are two very different pleasures: dressing is objective, following others; eating is subjective, following oneself. Because one cannot dress according to one's own ideas, one must learn to be fashionable, and thus fashion is born. Stubborn personalities are more common among men, so it is difficult to say how men's fashion changes significantly, and the changes are very slow.</p>
<p>The story of the cheongsam is also very interesting. For more than ten years, there has been a very popular form of enjoyment in China, which is listening to or watching Mei Lanfang perform. Mei Lanfang has extensive social connections, not only with wealthy officials, celebrities, and socialites in the country, but also with most of the ambassadors, consuls, and large merchants stationed in China. Mei Lanfang is always dressed in men's clothing and with short hair when socializing, but this does not detract from his beauty as a female character in the play! Coincidentally, during the craze of the public electing Mei Lanfang as the president of China, women cutting their hair also became a trend. Occasionally, someone admired Mei Lanfang's style and tried men's clothing, and it was found to be fresh and beautiful. So all the women cut their hair short and put on a long gown! Some people thought that the trousers underneath were indecent, and they remembered that the cheongsam of Manchurian women was very unique, so they adopted the cheongsam without slits. At that time, a dance star from Paris, Miss Dan Gatty, was hired to perform in New York. On the deck of the Atlantic liner, she was discovered to have unique beauty in her legs! Suddenly, women's clothing in Europe and America was cut off by almost half its length, and our cheongsam was also affected. When the Miss Europe was selected in 1930, the judges explained that her head accounted for only one-eighth of her entire body in proportion, which was the beauty of ancient Greek women. In order to make the head appear smaller, one had to lengthen the clothing, and the cheongsam could not escape this influence. The collar was raised and the sleeves were shortened, also because a large head and short neck were not fashionable! At the same time, the slits were raised, unwilling to cover the legs that had not yet grown tired of seeing.</p>
<p>When will the story of the cheongsam come to an end? We cannot predict. We hope that Shanghai ladies will redesign it themselves or continue the new story of the cheongsam themselves. (Once it becomes fashion, it becomes a story, no matter how new it is!)</p>
<h3>Changes in Women's Clothing This Week</h3>
<p>— Editor's Report</p>
<p>Regarding women's cheongsams, the pleated cheongsam drawn in the fifth issue of this magazine has gradually become popular. That is, long pleats are stitched with double crepe in the slits of the clothes, like a hundred-pleat skirt, which is very elegant and beautiful. The fabric of the cheongsam is mostly agate crepe lined with velvet.</p>
<p>Regarding coats, dark-colored woolen fabrics are generally used. The fur collar is no longer completely lined on the collar, but is one inch away from the edge of the collar, so it looks like a wide border is inlaid with the same color wool on the fur collar. But most of the fur collars are black.</p>
<h3>After Returning Home (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>In the vast expanse of the sea, a large mail ship was sailing through the white waves. Wisps of white smoke rose into the air, as if competing with the white clouds. White gulls flew back and forth on the sea surface, disappearing into the white clouds and white smoke for a while.</p>
<p>At that time, the sea was calm and the waves were calm, as clear as a mirror, which symbolized the couple returning from overseas on the mail ship, loving each other and trusting each other without suspicion. They were on the deck, standing shoulder to shoulder by the iron railing, constantly whispering sweet words, and from time to time, silvery laughter came from the woman's mouth, echoing the sound of the rushing water under the ship.</p>
<p>Mr. C was returning home this time. He had been studying medicine in Germany for five years. After five years of hard work, he had not wasted his time, because he had a doctorate in medicine in his luggage, and he also had a blue-eyed, blonde German wife by his side. This was the spoils of his five years of struggle, enough to show off to his countrymen and make him proud. Originally, he had lived in Germany for five years and married a German wife. All his life and all his habits had been completely Germanized. He had long forgotten his hometown, his parents, brothers and sisters, and even more forgotten the Chinese motherland where he had lived and depended on for five years. He planned to live in Germany for a long time and end his life in Germany. But his wife did not think so, saying, "You are Chinese, you should not forget China. Although I am German, since I married you, then I am also Chinese. You don't want to go back, but I insist on going back to see this ancient civilization of thousands of years." Mr. C was very strong-willed, but he did not dare not listen to his wife, so he packed his luggage and brought his wife back to China.</p>
<p>Mr. C's hometown was Shanghai, which was also the destination of the large mail ship. One morning, Mr. C and his wife finally arrived in Shanghai. Mr. C had lived in Germany for a long time and had never felt homesick. This time, he returned to China at his wife's behest, so he was very indifferent when he saw his hometown. It was his wife who was very excited. As soon as she landed, she jumped around like a canary, looking at this and looking at that, chattering endlessly. She warmly kissed Mr. C and said like a yellow oriole, "Dear, this is your motherland. I love you, and I love your motherland." Mr. C just smiled faintly and replied jokingly, "My love, you only need to love me wholeheartedly. If you fall in love with others, I will be jealous!"</p>
<p>Although Mr. C had arrived in his hometown, he did not dare to take his wife to his dilapidated home to see his two old-fashioned parents. In order to suit his Europeanized lifestyle, he first stayed in a first-class foreign hotel. For three consecutive days, he accompanied his wife around the city, but his destinations were purely Europeanized movie theaters, Western restaurants, and dance halls, and he refused to let his wife see the oriental scenery, fearing that it would taint his wife's noble eyes. Instead, his wife became impatient and said, "I have long been tired of these occasions in my own country. Why don't you let me experience some of your country's local customs?" Mr. C had no choice but to reluctantly invite his wife to a Cantonese meal and took a walk in the City God Temple.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>It had been more than a month since Mr. C returned to China. He first rented a three-story Western-style house to settle his wife. All the furniture and decorations were of course completely Europeanized. Three meals a day had to be Western food. But he still felt all kinds of dissatisfaction with his daily life, even cursing that the air in China was bad and not hygienic. His wife listened and secretly laughed to herself, thinking that he had lived in Germany for five years and had become a foreign fanatic, belittling his motherland at any time and place, and had even abandoned the great righteousness of patriotism. He had to correct his mistakes. She was originally an intelligent woman. After thinking about it quietly, she came up with a plan.</p>
<p>One morning, she invited a girlfriend from the church to be her guide, and went to a Chinese silk and satin shop to buy a lot of silk and satin. She called a Chinese tailor to measure her whole body and tailor several Chinese-style women's clothes, such as cheongsams, vests, and long trousers, everything was available. In less than half a month, they were all made. She took off her Western clothes at her friend's house and put on a cheongsam and long trousers, and walked home in a flowery manner. Mr. C was very surprised when he saw it, stuttering and stammering, "Dear, you! How can you wear such corrupt clothes?" His wife replied charmingly, "Chinese clothes are not corrupt at all. I think they are far more comfortable than Western clothes. You are not satisfied with the materials of Western suits anyway, so I advise you to change to Chinese clothes. Moreover, the materials of Chinese clothes are all your own domestic products. You are Chinese, and you should use more Chinese goods!" Mr. C said with a bitter face, "No, no, no, it is okay for you women to wear Chinese clothes, but we men must wear a Western suit to look energetic. You still have to pay attention to the materials of Western suits for me." His wife could not persuade him, so she had to agree.</p>
<h3>The Influence of Fashion on the Economy (Continued) - Peculiar Interests and Crazy Decorations</h3>
<p>— Xu Tao</p>
<p>Fashion is a characteristic of civilized nations.</p>
<p>Above, we have roughly discussed the influence of fashion and its economy. Will everyone criticize it? No, definitely not. At least in my personal opinion, even if all slanders and regulations are used to prohibit it, fashion will always exist in the world. At the same time, fashion is still the most desired and best-regarded fruit of society that is protected. And in fact, a fashion that is even more slanderously prohibited is often the most likely to prevail in society. One more point, we should also note: the change of clothing is actually the most in line with nature. Because the changes in the scenery of nature give us an impression, a pattern. In life, constantly seeing the same clothing and the same color will inevitably make people feel monotonous and boring. Different and different humans can prove to be superior to birds and beasts with unchanging feathers in all seasons. We can say that the impermanence of fashion is indeed an incurable frivolity, a distant evidence proving the noble and changeable culture of mankind. Because fashion is rich in production, and at the same time has the effect of promoting the refinement of all imagination and thought for the transformation of production. In uncivilized nations, a piece of clothing can often be preserved for centuries. We can say that the culture of such nations has stagnated. On the contrary, in civilized nations, clothing continues to change: from this, we can see the confirmation of great freedom and rapid progress.</p>
<p>We can use this sentence as the conclusion of this article: In the land of art, in the most lovely sense, women have used art, the wonderful art: they can boast of having fulfilled a responsibility. (End)</p>
<h3>Black Sheep at the Entrance of the Cave (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>I said, according to what you said, Old Brother, if there is such a problem with a pair of pants, do we have to abandon them completely? He said, "That's not necessarily true. There is still a way to remedy it." I said, "Although I am a thin person, I still need to ask you about this remedy." He then stepped forward and said, "Besides sending it to a darning shop to 'patch it up', is there any other secret recipe?"</p>
<p>On the Mid-Autumn Festival, I went to the Bansongyuan Garden and walked through a man-made cave. Suddenly, I saw that there were several people in the cave, the person at the head almost blocking the entrance of the cave with a morning coat made of beauty chantung satin. When I saw this group of dark shadows, I immediately thought of Xianhuang's body, because one day when he and I went to the Wing On Company to buy things, he was squeezed in and out of the elevator door because there were too many people. The embarrassing situation made me laugh. While I was thinking about laughing, the dark shadow suddenly poked its head out. It was none other than Xianhuang.</p>
<p>When I saw him, I was very happy. When I looked at him again, I saw that he was wearing a new navy blue serge suit, which made him look even darker in the cave. I said, "Old Li, have you added new clothes again?" He said, "Yes, this is a domestic product from the Zhanghua Factory. I have been wearing it for more than three months." I took a look at his stomach and then asked, "I think you have already been to the darning shop." He said, "It was patched up yesterday." As he spoke, he used his finger to point at his thigh for me to see. I was confused for a moment, scratching my head and saying, "What, isn't the problem in the crotch of the pants?" He laughed loudly, waved the cigarette in his fingers in front of me, and said, "The hole on the leg is a cigarette burn. The crotch of the pants is still intact and there is probably no problem." He also said proudly, "This small cigarette burn proves the high quality of Zhanghua wool, which is not easy to break, because where the cigarette burns, there is a burnt smell. If it is not pure wool, how can there be this smell!"</p>
<p>I said, "Haha, so that's how it is. No wonder a great body like yours, Old Brother, is willing to come and drill this cave in a new Western suit!"</p>
<h3>A Discussion of the Clothing of Overseas Returnees</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, Ms. Huang Qiongs returned to China from France. She was interviewed at her residence about the situation of French clothing, which was very interesting. Ms. Huang said: There are many elements of clothing, and naming and color schemes occupy the most important positions. The novelty and uniqueness of the name can attract the attention of customers, and the fresh and beautiful colors can especially attract the purchasing desire of women in general. French clothing has the most changes and the newest colors. With each change, there is a degree of progress. The popular clothing fabrics are sold out in just one or two days. In general, the fashion colors and clothing of European and American countries change with the city of Paris. The clothing companies and silk and cotton fabric stores of various countries all follow the lead of Parisians. The great efforts they make are evident. After Ms. Huang finished speaking, I asked if she had visited the products of Chinese national product factories. Ms. Huang said that the Meiya silk and satin, Zhanghua wool, and Hongxin cloth can indeed exceed expectations and add a lot of glory to Chinese national products. In terms of naming alone, Meiya's Jiuman crepe, coral crepe, Mama crepe, and Brocade crepe, and Hongxin's Butterfly wool, Qi Jing Ge, Anqi Ge, and Progressive wool, the naming is so elegant and profound. She then introduced and talked with Mr. Xu Yangnan of Hongxin, and visited his factory. Ms. Huang deeply admired his ingenuity in management and the rapid progress, saying that he has four advantages:</p>
<p>(1) The colors are bright and can be kept from fading. (2) The patterns are unique and have an elegant charm. (3) The prices are low and very economical. (4) The materials are strong and durable to wear. Mr. Xu admired her insightful words and was willing to learn from her at all times to achieve perfection.</p>

<h3>Oscillating Stability</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>In transmitters, the stability of the oscillating tube's oscillation is extremely important. If the oscillating tube's plate voltage is unstable, then the oscillation cannot be stable, and the efficiency of the transmitter will not be good. The attached diagram shows a circuit for stabilizing the plate voltage. 10 is used as the oscillating tube, and its plate voltage is supplied by a 1200-volt power source. Two 50s are used to stabilize the plate voltage of 10. They have a certain plate current under normal plate voltage, about 40 to 50 milliamperes each. The voltage is reduced by using two 50s and the load of 10, as well as the resistance of a 10,000-ohm and 60-watt light bulb to supply the plate of 10. The C voltage is approximately 400 volts. Under normal circumstances, the voltage received by the grid of 50 is the C voltage minus the voltage drop between A and B. Now, suppose the voltage supplied to the plate suddenly rises by more than 1200 volts, then the current will also increase. Therefore, the voltage drop between A and B also increases, and at the same time, the voltage received by the grids of the two 50s becomes much smaller. As a result, 50 passes more current, increasing the voltage drop across the 60-watt light bulb, so the oscillating tube still gets the required plate voltage without being affected by the increase in power supply voltage. If the C voltage and the two resistors are used appropriately, and the power supply voltage variation does not exceed 50%, then the plate of 10 can obtain a constant and unchanging voltage. Therefore, the oscillation is stable and the transmitter's efficiency is greatly increased. The above voltage stabilization method is similar in nature to a filter, because it also smooths out unstable fluctuating voltages, acting like a filter capacitor. However, it requires a large-capacity C battery. As for other uses, it is up to the reader to infer from one example.</p>
<h3>Oscillation Suppression</h3>
<p>— Chen Qibei</p>
<p>High-frequency amplification is most prone to oscillation, which can render the entire machine ineffective. Therefore, it is necessary to equip it with a suppressor to avoid it. Now, a few kinds are briefly listed below for comrades' reference.</p>
<p>The simplest method is to wind the antenna circuit and grid circuit coils in opposite directions, as shown by L1 and C2 in the first figure, which can prevent oscillation.</p>
<p>Another method is to connect an anti-phase coil and a stabilizing capacitor in the high-frequency output coil to balance the capacitance of the vacuum tube. (as L2 and L3 in the second figure) The number of turns of L3 and the capacitance of C2 must be determined by trial and error.</p>
<p>It can also be effective to use a coil and a stabilizing capacitor at the high-frequency input (as shown in the third figure). Another method is to connect a 600 to 800-ohm resistor to the grid of the high-frequency amplification vacuum tube, which is also an effective suppression method. (as shown in the fourth figure)</p>
<p>The method in the fifth figure is to use coils wound with double wires at the high-frequency output, such as L2 and L3. L3 is connected as usual, and one end of L2 is connected to B, and the other end is connected to a neutralizing capacitor C2 adjustable plate. The fixed plate of C2 is connected to the grid of the vacuum tube, which can also be effective.</p>
<h3>Automatic Regenerative Type</h3>
<p>— Wei Xinsu</p>
<p>All regenerative radios have a design to control feedback, which adds a kind of management annoyance to the listener. As for the automatic regenerative type, it only needs to be calibrated once at the beginning, and then there is no need for additional adjustment procedures.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure: The coil L is an ordinary grid coil, and L1 is a feedback coil. L and L1 are simultaneously resonated with external radio signals by the tuning of a dual-gang variable capacitor C. The radio frequency current on the detector tube's plate is fed back to the tuning regenerative circuit through a blocking capacitor C2. Capacitor C1 is a coupling capacitor.</p>
<p>If there is no electrical capacity in C1, magnetic coupling occurs between L and L1, then the plate feedback current will be enhanced at the low-capacity end of the tuning dial's capacitance. If there is an electrical capacity in C1, no magnetic coupling occurs between L and L1, then the feedback effect will be enhanced at the high-capacity end of the dial's capacitance.</p>
<p>If we make the coupling of L and L1 and the capacitance coupling of C1 to a suitable degree, we can obtain a feedback amount that does not change over the entire tuning dial.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the automatic regenerative type, the following points should be noted: The coils and tuning capacitors must be correct, and the lead lengths of the two circuits must be the same. The capacitance of C1 and the degree of magnetic induction must be obtained through experimentation. The coupling with the antenna should not be too tight, otherwise the detector grid circuit resonance will inevitably be forced, causing the balance of each circuit to be destroyed, and often causing dead spots in the feedback.</p>
<p>The radio frequency choke coil on the detector tube's plate is very important for obtaining smooth and stable use. RFC1 must have the ability to choke radio frequency current within the tuning band. RFC2 is approximately 85M.H.C325oMMF.o</p>
<h3>Vacuum Tube Disconnections</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>The vacuum tube is the heart of radio, so the diseases of vacuum tubes must be known to those who study radio. The internal structure of vacuum tubes is constantly changing, and complex manufacturing cannot be fully explained in a short time. Now, based on my past experience, I will report on vacuum tube disconnections.</p>
<p>Once, one of my #47 vacuum tubes suddenly became unusable. I knew that I was very careful and did not damage the internals, and this vacuum tube had only been used for half a year, so its lifespan should not be so short. So I started checking. At first, I found that the two F pins of the filament were not connected. I was even more suspicious, but after tilting the vacuum tube to the side, I found that the F pins were connected. After testing for a long time, I realized that the filament was not damaged. So I put the vacuum tube in warm water to separate the bakelite part at the bottom of the tube. I then discovered that it was not the filament that had broken, but rather the solder joint where the filament connected to the tube pin had desoldered.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a friend of mine who was initially fascinated by radio ran to my house to tell me that he had bought an #80 vacuum tube in a second-hand shop for only one-fifth of the price of a new one. But when he bought it back and used it, it was already damaged and the filament could not light up. When he tested it with a multimeter, the filament was not new. I took his #80 vacuum tube and thought for a long time. I suddenly remembered the previous incident. I immediately took off the bakelite part at the bottom of the vacuum tube and, sure enough, discovered the trick of the second-hand shop. It turned out that the two pins from the filament to the bottom of the bakelite part were connected together. After separating them and testing with a multimeter, the filament inside was broken. Because the mercury layer of some vacuum tubes is very thick, it is impossible to see from the outside whether the filament in the vacuum tube is broken. Therefore, I hope that radio enthusiasts will not forget their tricks when buying vacuum tubes in second-hand shops just because the price is cheap. Although this is a very small matter, I think there must be many who have been fooled, so I brought it up to say a few words.</p>
<h3>Volume Adjustment Methods (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>There are several new types of vacuum tubes (such as 51, 35, 58, etc.) whose amplification factor varies with the amount of C voltage. Therefore, adding a variable resistor in the cathode circuit can also adjust the volume. New radios generally use this method when using these types of vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>The best way to adjust the volume is to start with the high-frequency circuit. If the radio does not use high-frequency amplification, then the volume adjustment can also be used in the low-frequency circuit without the detector tube being overloaded.</p>
<p>Connecting a variable resistor in parallel on the secondary coil of the first-stage low-frequency transformer or the primary coil of the second-stage, (as shown in the third figure) can also achieve satisfactory results if the input low frequency has not been overloaded and distorted. Connecting a variable resistor in parallel on the binding posts of the loudspeaker can also adjust the volume.</p>
<p>Of course, the best result is the automatic volume adjustment method. It can not only automatically adjust the volume, but also avoid fading and reduce static. However, its use is very uneconomical (another vacuum tube must be added), and few aristocratic radios are equipped with it. Its principle has been detailed in the 13th issue of this publication, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>Now, the various volume adjustment methods mentioned above are listed in a table for readers to choose from.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Leisure (3)丨Current Situation of the Domestic Broadcasting Industry丨</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>(Shanghai) Shanghai's broadcasting industry began in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. At first, an American named Asthon founded the China Radio Company and set up a 50-watt broadcasting station. Due to poor management, it was suspended after three months. Subsequently, the American firm, Carlowitz &amp; Co., also broadcasted for a while. Due to poor business, it also stopped after half a year. In the summer of the thirteenth year, the Carlow Company was established. First, it built a 100-watt broadcasting station, and then increased the power to 250 watts. This was the beginning of Shanghai having a formal broadcasting station. At that time, the programs broadcast by Carlow Company were mostly Western music and foreign records, with Chinese records accounting for a very small number. After Chinese people argued for it, they added business information, current events, and Suzhou storytelling programs, but Western programs still accounted for the majority. In the sixteenth year, the Sun Sun Company set up a 50-watt broadcasting station, specializing in broadcasting various entertainment programs of the company, which was very popular among the audience at that time. In 1929, Carlow Company was closed due to poor business. At the same time, Sun Sun Company also stopped broadcasting, and radios almost became useless. At this time, the Shanghai Radio Station attached to the Asia-America Company, in a difficult environment, disregarded everything and resolutely opened. Thus, the Chinese radio broadcasting industry that was about to end was revived again. In the past two or three years, the addition of radio broadcasting stations has been like bamboo shoots after a rain. The number of programs is even difficult to count. For a time, it was thriving, with both good and bad mixed together.</p>
<p>Some people criticize the broadcasting programs of Shanghai radio stations with only ten words, called: "All broadcasts are advertisements, and every station tells stories." Although this statement feels too extreme, most radio stations are in this situation. For example, what you hear almost every morning is advertisements. What: "Cheap and good," "Buy one get one free," "Unprecedented big discount," "Regardless of cost"... etc., they report very skillfully, like elementary school students reciting textbooks. Listeners almost suspect that Shanghai is a cheap market, a dumping ground. In the afternoon, storytelling programs begin one after another. By the evening, what you hear is either Mr. Tang and Qiuxiang, or Fan Jashu and Shen Fengxi. The storyteller strums the sanxian while tightening his throat and singing the lyrics. At this time, Shanghai is almost becoming a storytelling world.</p>
<p>When the author returned to his hometown (Songjiang) this summer, he lived in seclusion and boredom, and used listening to radio broadcasts as a pastime. Therefore, I feel that the broadcasting programs of Shanghai radio stations have made considerable progress recently. Several have already achieved the goal of "academics as the mainstay and entertainment as the supplement." Now, I will express my humble opinions on what I have seen and heard:</p>
<p>(SHHX) The Shanghai Radio Station's program selection is the most cautious. Academic programs account for the most. It absolutely does not broadcast boring programs or obscene records. (The author has personally heard the station refuse listeners' requests for inappropriate records many times.) It is especially admirable. However, due to the background relationship of the station, the reporting is too commercial, which makes people feel unhappy. Also, when explaining radio questions and answers, it often has an old-fashioned tone, which also makes people feel impatient.</p>
<p>(UHHX) The broadcasting of the Great China Radio Station is the most pleasant to hear. The sound of reporting the time is especially clear. This spring, the station broadcast Mr. Zhang Lian's erhu solo in the evening, mixed with pipa and Peking opera, etc. (Sometimes, young brothers and sisters are invited to play and sing opera or report everything, although not very experienced, but also has a special flavor.) At that time, the station's power was 500 watts, the broadcasting range was far, and it was very satisfactory to listeners in various ports. Later, due to some relationship, the station reduced its power to 50 watts, and the broadcasting range was greatly reduced. (It is extremely difficult to receive in Beijing) Although there are many programs on the station recently, it is not as good as before.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Recent Broadcasting Situation in Soviet Russia Not long ago, a 1,000-watt radio station was considered a powerful radio station. Now, the powerful transmitter in the United States is 50,000 watts. The WLW radio station in Cincinnati is installing 500,000-watt equipment. At the same time, Soviet Russia is also planning a million-watt facility. Radio engineer Dr. Graham, who was hired by the Soviet government, recently returned to the United States. At a meeting of the Washington branch of the Engineers Association, he lectured on his travels to Soviet Russia and said: "Soviet Russia now has one 500,000-watt radio station, five 100,000-watt radio stations, and five or sixty 1,000 to 25,000-watt radio stations. The Soviet government is equally prepared for transmitting radio stations and radios, because they are both government property. The stronger the radio station, the cheaper suitable radios can be manufactured. Conversely, the weaker the radio station, the more expensive the radio. Based on this theory, the government is studying whether to add a 500,000-watt radio station or build a million-watt radio station in the second five-year plan. Soviet Russia now has 3 million radio receivers, and plans to increase to 20 million within five years. Factories can manufacture 600,000 units per year. After five years, the annual output will be 1.5 million units.</p>
<p>— B.Y.</p>
<p>Eagle Brand New Six-Tube Radio The Eagle Brand Majestic six-tube radio arrived for the first time in August with dozens of units. The machine is manufactured with novelty, and the internal parts are completely from the latest products. The radio can achieve the clarity of eight tubes. Therefore, the new goods were sold out in less than a week, which shows that the machine is new and reliable. This time, more than 200 units have arrived. Various electrical appliance stores have heard the news and immediately went to purchase more than 100 units, including various styles. The remaining lightweight six-tube radios, AC-DC dual-purpose, and car radios, still have more than 100 units, displayed in the sample room of Wheeler Company at No. 20 Nanjing Road. Many people went to buy them yesterday, so the sales of new six-tube radios have been very brisk recently.</p>
<p>Heming Radio Station to Broadcast "Yang Naiwu" Starting This Month The case of Yang Naiwu shook the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang during the late Qing Dynasty. Many officials were removed from their positions because of this. Later, it was adapted into Suzhou storytelling and broadcast on the radio once, which was very popular among the audience, but it was stopped halfway. It is now known that the Heming Radio Station on Zhonghua Road in the South City, in response to the audience's request, has specially hired Suzhou storyteller Zhang Shaoquan to tell and sing "Yang Naiwu." Starting from November 3rd, it will be broadcast on time from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, which is expected to be enjoyed by all walks of life. The station's frequency is 1440 kHz, the power is 30 watts, and the broadcasting is known for its clarity.</p>

<h3>Central University Steadily Wins the Jiangnan University All-Around Championship. Guanghua Leads Central by Four Points in Total Score on the First Day. Guanghua's Performance in Ten Sports is Not as Good as Central's</h3>
<p>Chen Baoqiu Wins First Place in Five Events Guanghua Wins Two Relay Championships</p>
<p>Cross-Country Race to be Held Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 3rd) The second session of the Jiangnan University All-Around Games was held at the Central University Sports Field on the morning of the 3rd. Participants included more than 40 athletes from six schools: Central, Jiaotong, Jinan, Jinling, Guanghua, and Daxia. The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 AM. After Chairman Wu Yunrui delivered the opening speech, the photo was taken and the competition began immediately. The events completed on the 3rd were the 1500-meter medley relay and the 1600-meter relay race, as well as the first half of the five-event and ten-event competitions. The results of the competition were: Guanghua won first place in the 1600-meter relay race and second place in the five events. Chen Saiqiu of Daxia won first place in the five events with a score of 2717.75 points. The two relay championships both belonged to Guanghua. The time of 3 minutes and 44.8 seconds in the 1600-meter race set a new Jiangnan University record. Wu Jinqi of Daxia led the ten-event first half with 2639.32 points. The 400-meter relay and the second half of the ten events will be held on the afternoon of the 4th. The championship will be contested by Central and Guanghua. In addition, the Jiangnan University cross-country race will also be held on the 4th. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Wu Yunrui's Speech</h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of the All-Around Games was first held at the Central University playground yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Wu Yunrui, director of the Central University Department of Physical Education, presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech, which mainly stated that the fate of university sports has gradually declined. Except for the United States, which still has university sports, Europe only focuses on competitive sports for all students. Because university athletes compete for the honor of the school, they lose academic studies for themselves, which is contrary to the original intention of promoting sports. This time, the All-Around Games and Cross-Country Games are both held in Beijing. The schedule is arranged to allow those who participate in the All-Around Games to have the opportunity to participate in the Cross-Country Race. Therefore, after the All-Around Games are completed tomorrow morning, they can join the Cross-Country Race in the afternoon. However, Central University athletes who join the All-Around Games will not participate in the Cross-Country Race to show fairness. What is most taboo in sports is winning by tricks. For example, in the tennis match held in Shanghai this time, placing good players in the second singles is an unfair arrangement. The Shanghai newspaper has already commented that it is wrong, etc.</p>
<h3>Luo Jialun's Speech</h3>
<p>Then, Central University President Luo Jialun delivered a speech, mainly stating that the Jiangnan University All-Around Games are being held at our school, which is very welcome. Most of the athletes have participated in this year's National Games. It is hoped that the malpractices that occurred in the National Games will not be repeated in this conference. The National Games uses provinces and cities as units. Athletes overemphasize the honor and disgrace of the units they represent, which leads to disputes and loss of sportsmanship and the spirit of coordination and cooperation with each other. This is something that needs to be improved urgently. It is hoped that university athletes will not emphasize the schools they represent, but emphasize the ethics that athletes should have. For example, when Shanghai volleyball won Guangdong in the National Games, the Shanghai team showed all kinds of proud expressions. In fact, the Shanghai volleyball players are all Cantonese and Fujianese, not Shanghainese. Such meaningless disputes are not very meaningful. In addition, in terms of sports publicity, the newspapers at the National Games described the winning athletes in great detail. If the description was not enough, they added various photos. The National Games special publication was full of beautiful things, but it has lost the original intention of promoting sports. I have already discussed this matter with the press a few days ago, and I hope that it will be improved in the future. After Luo's speech, the sports began at 9:30. The scores of each event are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Yesterday's School Scores</h3>
<p>First Guanghua University 22 points</p>
<p>Second Central University 18 points</p>
<p>Third Daxia University 14 points</p>
<p>Fourth Jiaotong University 12 points</p>
<h3>Total Score of Five Events</h3>
<p>First Chen Shiqiu (Daxia) 2717.75 points</p>
<p>Second Xu Yong (Central) 2144.637</p>
<p>Third Zhou Shu'an (Jiaotong) 1769.405</p>
<p>Fourth Hong Xiangting (Guanghua) 1670.02 points</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu's scores are as follows: long jump 5 meters 93, javelin 40 meters 01, 200 meters 25 seconds 4, discus 32 meters 875, 1500 meters 5 minutes 8 seconds 8.</p>
<h3>Top Scores of Ten Events</h3>
<p>First Wu Jinqi (Daxia) 2639.32 points</p>
<p>Second Deng Kanshun (Central) 2459.25 points</p>
<p>Third Li Disheng (Central) 2281.25 points</p>
<p>Fourth Zhu Zhangcen (Guanghua) 2054.12 points</p>
<p>Fifth Wang Fengting (Jinling) 2042.49 points</p>
<p>Sixth Li Jianxue (Jinling) 1945.49 points</p>

<h3>Central University Steadily Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Guanghua has very little strength in the ten-event competition of the All-Around Games. It is still a question whether Zhu Zhangcen can maintain the fourth place. Central has Li Disheng and Deng Kanshun, who can at least get the second and third places. It is difficult to tell who is better in the 400-meter relay between Central and Guanghua. However, judging from the situation of the ten events, even if Guanghua wins the relay championship, Central will still have the most points in total. Therefore, although Guanghua has the advantage in the total score on the first day, the championship is still steadily won by Central.</p>
<p>The second half of the ten-event competition on the 4th is the championship competition between Guanghua and Central. The 400-meter relay is the most important key. Whoever gets first place gets the All-Around Championship. Central has Li Disheng and Deng Kanshun participating in the ten events. Li and Deng are very strong. They will either get first and third or second and third. Guanghua only has Zhu Zhangcen, and his strength is relatively weak. I am afraid he cannot get first place. If Central wins the 400-meter relay, it will steadily win the All-Around Championship. The team members are as follows: Guanghua Team (1) Dong Shuzhao, (2) Tao Yingjie, (3) Jiang Qing, (4) Dong Yinchu, Central Team (1) Liu Yingjun, (2) Lu Linyu (3) Ge Bokang, (4) Yang Daogui.</p>
<h3>Disorganized Competition Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 3rd) The competition order on the 4th is high jump, discus, 400-meter relay race, pole vault, 1500 meters, and the cross-country race, which is also scheduled to be held on the 4th. The route is more than 6,000 meters.</p>
<h3>Cross Country Race Today</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 3rd) The Jiangnan University cross-country race is scheduled to be held in Beijing at 3:00 PM on the 4th, with Jinling University as the starting and ending point. The total distance is more than 6,000 meters. Participants include eight schools: Central, Jinling, Jiaotong, Fudan, Guanghua, Jinan, Daxia, and Chizhi, with more than 60 athletes. Central University, Fudan University, and Jinan University are all strong and should have a fierce competition.</p>
<h3>Cross Country Route</h3>
<p>(2) The starting point is designated in front of the gate of the Zhonghua Girls' High School on Baotai Street, Nanjing. (3) The route turns left from Baotai Street, passes through Shimiaokou to Gaoloumen, turns again to the black road of the Central Party Headquarters, passes through Shiziqiao and Hubei Road, and goes straight to Gulou Fujin Road to turn right, passes the front gate of Jinling University, and enters through the side gate, circles the Jinling University athletic field once to reach the finish line. The total length is about 7,000 meters. (4) It is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on the 4th, rain or shine. Athletes participating in the five-event and ten-event competitions are not allowed to participate in the relay.</p>
<h3>Participating Athletes from Various Schools</h3>

<h3>Training Directorate Plans to Establish Military Sports School</h3>
<p>Pan Youqiang of the National Military Education Department of the National Revolutionary Army to serve as Principal</p>
<p>First to operate four classes, with emphasis on national martial arts, physical education, and military affairs</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 3rd) The establishment of a military sports school by the Training Directorate is inevitable. However, the location, previously designated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the Central Sports Field, has not yet been discussed with the Mausoleum Management Committee, and thus remains undecided. However, due to the large amount of funds required for the construction of classrooms and other facilities, it is now planned to use the old artillery site as the school building, which is expected to save on equipment costs. The final decision on the location has not yet been made. However, it has been decided that the principal will be Pan Youqiang, of the National Military Education Department of the Training Directorate. The school plans to first operate four classes: (1) Students graduating in one year will serve as junior officers in various military police and defense corps, focusing on the knowledge and skills of physical education and improving the basic physical education knowledge and skills of military police teams to improve the basic physical education of military police teams. (2) Students graduating in two years will be recruited through public examinations, selecting those with strong physiques and imparting military and physical education knowledge and skills. (3) Short-term normal classes will recruit primary and secondary school physical education teachers, providing two months of training to enable them to go out to train youth in sports and promote physical health for young children and teens. (4) Miscellaneous Guidance Class: Talented athletes from across the country will be selected and trained to participate in international sports events. On weekdays, they will travel to various armies to guide military sports. The army emphasizes obedience, which can break the athletes' pride. The school's teaching materials emphasize national martial arts, physical education, and military affairs, and strive to integrate them to create a new foundation for Chinese sports.</p>

<h3>Sun Daosheng Retains Third Place in Zhongqing Handball Ranking Tournament</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Huang Kesu lost 0-2.</p>
<p>In yesterday's second match of the Zhongqing Handball Ranking Tournament, Xia Zeren faced Yu Guanghan; Yu forfeited. The first match, between Sun Daosheng and Huang Kesu, was exceptionally exciting. Huang is young and handsome, and has advanced two levels in this tournament. Yesterday's match was unusually intense. If Sun had not been experienced, it would have been difficult to win. The first game was tense from beginning to end, with the score very close. However, Huang still had openings, which Sun took advantage of to directly attack. Before long, Huang lost three consecutive points, losing 18-21. In the second game, Sun continued to score, and although Huang tried his best to cope, he was unable to gain an advantage, eventually losing again by a score of 16-21. The two men's rankings remained unchanged, in third and fourth place respectively.</p>

<h3>National Translation and Compilation Bureau Seeks Opinions on Arithmetic Naming and Sectioning</h3>
<p>Separate letters sent to the China Science Society and other organizations in this city.</p>
<p>Please formulate rules for compilation.</p>
<p>The National Translation and Compilation Bureau recently sent separate letters to the China Science Society and other academic institutions in this city: Dear Sir/Madam, Regarding the naming and sectioning of arithmetic, the Ministry of Education, in June of the 20th year, according to the request of the China Bookstore, issued a general order to abolish the use of the words "Yi" and "Zhao," and to use numbers above the word "Wan" to show uniformity. In November of the 21st year, according to the request of the Nanjing Social Bureau to unify the arithmetic large number positioning and sectioning, the Ministry instructed this bureau to review and report. This bureau immediately formulated standards and requested approval for implementation. In April of the 22nd year, the Ministry of Education convened a discussion meeting on astronomy and mathematics in Nanjing, and again proposed discussing the standards for arithmetic naming and sectioning. It was decided that large numbers should be recorded in base 10 for "Ge, Shi, Bai, Qian, Wan," and in base 10,000 for "Yi, Zhao, Jing, Gai," etc., and the Ministry of Education submitted it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for review. Now, we have received Instruction No. 8930 from the Ministry of Education, which states: "After investigating the standard for arithmetic naming and sectioning, the Ministry has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for review.

<h3>New Anhui Children's Travel Group Visited Foreign Primary Schools in this City Yesterday: Children's Welfare Association and Others to Host this Afternoon</h3>

<h3>Qiu Zhi Elementary School Adds Buildings</h3>

In the 21st academic year, it was decided to organize a school building addition committee to actively promote the project. Recently, with the enthusiastic support of Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang and Mr. Yang Xinzheng, members of the school building addition committee, who generously donated a large sum of money, the project has become guaranteed.

<h3>The Opera Troupe</h3>
<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>A theater must have an opera troupe; an opera troupe must have roles such as the male lead, female lead, painted-face roles, and clowns. Only then can the gongs and drums be struck and the singing and acting begin. If it goes well, it can last for half a year or a year; if it doesn't, they'll have to move on to another venue.</p>
<p>A government office must have a group of officials; a group of officials must have leaders, directors, clerks, secretaries, and various other titles. Only then can they post notices, sit in court, put on airs, and throw their weight around. If it goes well, it can last for several years; if it doesn't, there will be a reorganization.</p>
<p>Actually, the official arena is like a theater. They are indeed similar. Listen to this: the organization of officials is like an opera troupe. The posting of red notices by officials, saying they are taking office by order, is like an opera troupe putting up advertisements, saying they are performing on an auspicious day. The music and speeches at the inauguration of officials are like the warm-up acts and the "adding blessings" performance when actors take the stage. The officials' visits to gentry and merchants are like actors' visits to celebrities from all walks of life. The officials' statements of political views are like actors reciting introductory lines before a performance. The officials' routine execution of orders is like the actors' singing and acting. The praise of officials' virtuous governance is like the cheering and applause for the actors' performance. The impeachment of officials is like the booing and jeering of actors. The officials' mass resignation is like the expiration of the actors' contract. The officials' blocking of the carriage and lying in the road to express their pleas is like actors being begged to stay for three more days. The officials' transfer to other places is like the actors moving to another venue.</p>
<p>The actors sing the same old tunes over and over, but people still love to listen. But the officials do the same old routines over and over, and people get tired of listening. This is why being an official is harder than being an actor. Spending a little money can buy you an official position, but spending even more money cannot buy you an actor's role. This is why being an actor is harder than being an official. In short, each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The dead know this well. I have never been an official, not even a small one, nor have I been an opera actor, not even an extra, so I don't know the details.</p>
<h3>Mud Men and Water Women</h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>I remember a saying among women a few years ago: "Black lacquered bench," which is a modified pronunciation of "Husband," which is what they called their husbands. Imagine, becoming a black lacquered bench after becoming a husband. Wouldn't that be extremely unlucky? Any man qualified to be a husband can only have them sit on his behind. This can be said to be an insult to men.</p>
<p>Later, the men, feeling resentful, came up with a way to retaliate. They said that women are flower vases, good only for display, filled with water and with flower branches inserted. Who knew that they would refuse to accept this directly? Several of them came out to resist, saying that if men insist on calling us flower vases, then we will ask men to be the stands under the flower vases. In this way, men become flower vase stands, and they can only have women sit on their behinds. This has the same meaning as the black lacquered bench. In other words, women are on top, and men are on the bottom. Men suffer a loss, and women gain an advantage. However, being a black lacquered bench still allows for some movement, because women don't sit on benches all day long. But if you become a flower vase stand, you simply have no chance to rise to the top all year round, constantly being pressed down by women.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have said that women are Bodhisattvas, because they dress up in alluring ways and make people worship them. Therefore, they call them Bodhisattvas. Others say that the word "Bodhisattva" should be used for men, because men mostly wear suits and leather shoes, looking very important, but inside they are just a bag of straw, like a mud Bodhisattva covered in gold.</p>
<p>I don't help monks, and I don't help nuns. Bao Yu said that girls are made of water, and men are made of mud. This is really true, especially suitable for the current relationship between men and women, when they are living in a muddled, confused state. Look, as long as you soak the mud in water, or pour water on the mud, then there will be water in the mud, and mud in the water. The mud and water will mix and transform, mud will become water, and water will become mud. You can no longer tell which is mud and which is water. Instead, it becomes a bowl of muddy soup! Understanding this principle, everyone should stop using witty terms to insult each other!</p>
<h3>Bonsai of Wanmi Mountain House</h3>
<p>— Chi Bi, Made by Kong Zhiqing</p>
<p>In the Qianliang Hall of the Yimiao Temple's Wanmi Mountain House, there is currently a group exhibiting calligraphy and bonsai. Famous painters such as Xu Xiaocun, Zhang Yuguang, Kong Xiaoyu, and Gao Shangzhi have all contributed masterpieces, which are exquisite and unparalleled. The bonsai are all made by Kong Zhiqing.

The exhibition will last for ten more days, which is enough for viewing. It is elegant and refined, truly adding color to the art world. (Juan)</p>
<h3>Tan Xu (Tan's Beard)</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Chu Minyi, Executive Secretary of the National Games Standing Committee and the Executive Yuan, for the sake of supporting the theatrical performance of the Games, he himself put on makeup and appeared on stage, showing his appearance to the audience. He can be called a very enthusiastic charitable official who is a central figure in the political world. It is said that before performing "Caoqiao Pass" and "Wei River," he actually cut off his beautiful beard under his chin with a sharp Bingzhou scissor, then shaved it off with a razor. A thoughtful and dignified beard suddenly turned into a modern youth with a white face and no beard. At the time when athletes from the capital and various provinces gathered, this news spread like wildfire. It can be seen that even a hair of a great man is not insignificant. The ancients said, "Plucking a hair to benefit the world." This saying is truly correct, and Mr. Chu's action is indeed worthy of it.</p>
<p>Although the beard of a real person seems to be of little importance, if you look back at the previous records, there is originally a very interesting piece of history. From a historical point of view, Zhou had ten ministers who resigned (mistakenly written as "governed") in disorder. Among them, Hongtian's face did not even show skin, it is said because the many sideburns and beards covered his appearance. And Yi Yin's face was even stranger, not to mention no beard, he didn't even have eyebrows. When King Ling of Zhou was born, he already had a mustache, and was called "Mustache King." Liu Bang of the Han Dynasty also had a beautiful beard. The Marquis of Hanshou Ting had five strands of long beard, which was very rare. Even women have grown beards. There are also verifiable allusions in ancient books. Therefore, since ancient times, articles about beards have been considered valuable. This time, don't blame the many reporters for taking pictures and detailing Mr. Chu's process of abandoning his beard!</p>
<p>However, even distinguishing between the beards themselves, it seems that there are some things related to fate. For example, Cao Mengde cut his beard, but wanted to avoid the enemy. Xia Fu abandoned his beard, just to escape for his life. Yu Fei cut off his beard, because he was marrying a wife. Yu Rang destroyed his beard, in order to change his appearance. The beard is the same beard, but the reason for breaking off the relationship with the beard and announcing a final farewell is very different. Not only that, Zhang Hua even wrapped colored silk around his beard to embellish it. Emperor Qi tied it with red rope like ropes, hanging it on his chest. This way of looking at the beard is very important. If Pei Jin Gong burned his beard impulsively, thinking he could gain a high reputation, then Xie Lingyun's beard would be unlucky, and as soon as he gave up his beard, his head would fall to the ground. Judging from these many people, isn't the beard also lucky and unfortunate? Although Mr. Chu has now shaved his beard, and sacrificed the remains of his parents for the sake of the compatriots in distress, it is truly admirable. Moreover, he said that shaving his beard is not a big deal, and it will grow out soon. What a great mind this is!</p>
<p>I often see that there are people who keep beards, thinking that it is a fashionable trend of "beauty art." Like those who come from the military, they mostly have a figure-eight mustache. Some of the new veterans mostly have sideburns connected to their hair, which can grow to the abdomen. There is a saying in Beijing of the "three big beards" (Mr. Chu is one of the three), which is where it comes from. Even if they are not old, they are unwilling not to use a beard to decorate themselves, staying under the nostrils, looking like two black dots from a distance, saying that it imitates the Japanese style, and also like the clown in the circus of Hai Jing Bo, which seems to be too ridiculous. It is not easy to be like Mr. Chu with just a beard. But after Mr. Chu's beard was shaved, no one has published where these kinds of beards are. They should also be preserved as a souvenir. I want to write an article to summon the beard, titled "O Beard, Return!"</p>

<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Passionate Tea Transmits Sorrow and Comforts the Husband and Son-in-Law, Hurriedly Leaving the Frontier, Forcing a Smile to Say Goodbye to the Family</p>
<p>Jiang said with a faint smile: "Don't worry about other people's beans being fried in the pot. I want to say something a little more fashionable. Your own loved one is also feeling extremely sad right now, why don't you go see him!" Zhao Ziqiang stood there smiling and looked at his father, but did not move his feet. Zhao Weng said: "There is nothing to be ashamed of, you should go see Miss Yang." Zhao Ziqiang just moved his feet two steps, then stopped again. Zhao Weng said sternly: "You should go, what are you hesitating about?" Hearing these words, Zhao Ziqiang then held his face and walked to the front yard. When he walked, his steps were very fast. But when he reached the door of the Yang family's house in the front yard, he slowed down his steps, gently opened the door, and coughed, then stepped inside. He saw Guizhi sitting on a square stool near the door, lowering her head, doing needlework. Seeing Zhao Ziqiang coming in, she put down her needlework and stood up, saying in a low voice with a slight smile: "You're back." As she spoke, she held the table, neither stepping forward nor stepping back, turned sideways, looking at Zhao Ziqiang. He walked two steps, took off his military cap, held it in his hand, and then smiled at Guizhi, "Are you sitting at home alone, aren't you bored?" Guizhi smiled slightly: "I used to sit at home like this, why would I be bored today?" Zhao Ziqiang still didn't dare to express too much intimacy, so he sat on an old plank stool outside the door. Guizhi turned around in the room for a while. Seeming very busy, Zhao Ziqiang said: "What are you busy with? Sit down, I have a few words to say to you." Guizhi smiled: "You have come from afar, I should pour you a cup of tea to drink." Zhao Ziqiang said: "Instead of drinking tea at home, we might as well go to the milk tea shop to talk, that would be much better." Guizhi shook her head and said: "It's better not to go. If we go today, we will naturally talk very happily. In the future, when I go to the milk tea shop alone, how emotional I will be." (230)</p>

<h3>Returned to Hometown丨Jilin</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>Returning to my hometown was in May. Before the trip, the first person to express dissent to me was Mu Tian. No, he was simply fundamentally opposed. Several times he even lost his temper with me, saying:</p>
<p>"You're simply messing around! Dalian's inspection is so strict, how could the Japanese let someone as young as you pass? What if they detain you!"</p>
<p>No matter how angry he got, I always answered him with an old saying, smiling, "It's okay, let me try."</p>
<p>"It's not a matter of trying or not. The problem is that if something goes wrong, the sacrifice is too meaningless! Do you understand!"</p>
<p>To be honest, I did "understand." I also admitted that Mu Tian's words were correct. However, at that time, I still had to say the words "let me try" to answer him, no matter how he persuaded, blocked, or got angry. The other people who expressed dissent to me were Yin Geng, Moping, and Zizhou. They did not approve of my going back and gave me well-intentioned advice, telling me to be more cautious and not to neglect the dangerous environment because I was eager to go home, which would lead to sacrificing my life.</p>
<p>But I finally left. I finally passed the inspection in Dalian and returned safely to my second hometown, Jilin.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the situation when I was inspected in Dalian, I still find it quite interesting. When the ship was docked, several Manchurian youths in suits came up. They were the inspectors. They judged people by their actions. Because I had not changed my attire, I immediately attracted their attention. One of them walked up to me and started questioning me.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Jilin."</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Li XX."</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"Student."</p>
<p>"Which school?"</p>
<p>"XX University."</p>
<p>"Why are you coming back?"</p>
<p>"Can't afford to study anymore, the family doesn't have the money to provide."</p>
<p>He also asked me if I was married, how many people were in my family. All the questions he asked, I had prepared in advance, and the answers didn't seem unnatural. He couldn't find any flaws. After a while, he looked at me carefully again and walked away. I brought a suitcase, and he didn't even look at it. That was considered an inspection. This so-called "strict" inspection, how could I not say it was "quite interesting!"</p>
<p>After arriving in Jilin, I saw my relatives and old friends. After meeting, they were almost like receiving an unexpected harvest in a famine year. They almost all used the tone of "unbelievable" to say: "Not easy, not easy, is Dalian easy to pass through?" This made me realize that the Dalian checkpoint was indeed very important. Fortunately, I was able to pass through it easily. Maybe it was my special luck?</p>
<p>Looking at Jilin, it was still the same Jilin as before. Besides the addition of some Japanese businesses and the construction of a few more buildings, it was generally no different from before. No, not that simple. I saw that there were more coolies on the streets than before, more beggars than before, and many old shops had closed down. From the newspaper reports, I saw that the occurrence of gun cases had become a common thing, and there were many times fewer students than before. Also, new five-color flags were flying everywhere, and slogans of Wangdaoism for saving the world were posted all over the streets and alleys. Japanese soldiers were occupying the Dongguan area, and at the same time, they held the power to rule the entire city's administration, military affairs, and police affairs. Their authority was above all else.</p>
<p>My friends asked me if I felt that Jilin was different from before. I said yes. I told them what I saw that was different. I also comforted myself that the students in Jilin had not all become decadent, because a few days after I returned to Jilin, there was a case of students being arrested. The reason for the arrest was that the students were scattering leaflets against Japanese imperialism in the dark night. Although people were arrested, from the event itself, it must be said that it had considerable significance.</p>
<h3>Dream</h3>
<p>— Lin Lai</p>
<p>The plums in the neighboring Zhang family's orchard were ripe and transparent. It was hateful that they had to be kept for sale, and even if our children stole a glance under the tree, Uncle Zhang would follow closely. It was such an impossible afternoon when my cousin told me that his mother told him that the mountains were full of free wild fruit. This news was immediately spread by me to our group. In less than a quarter of an hour, more than a dozen of us set off empty-handed and rushed to be the first. The time was nearly dark, and the route, of course, was not considered. Everyone thought that following the main road over a mountain was enough. All that was in their hearts was the illusion of an unknown world. As soon as we started on the road, we all rushed to be the first, and after a series of arguments, the result was that everyone went their own way to take shortcuts. All of a sudden, the team was scattered. As for me, in addition to wanting to be the first, I also wanted to pick more fruit, so I discussed with my cousin to choose a small road that I thought was the closest. But as soon as it got dark, my cousin had problems, either saying there were ghosts and refusing to go, or complaining that his legs were sore and he couldn't walk, as if someone had harmed him. He always used the fact that the future was unknown to encourage me to turn around, but I responded with a sneer and stubbornly walked alone. The moon shone on me on the gloomy road, and I shivered several times. All kinds of difficulties arose. I didn't have enough clothes, and I was hungry. Several times I almost lay down and cried for help.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a force of hope pushed me into a plum grove. It seemed that it was also dawn. Unfortunately, there was already a group of people crowding there. There were really not many plums hanging on the branches. Seeing those full bags, I realized that even if there was a whole pile of plums for me, I would have nowhere to put them. I suddenly felt as if someone had cheated me, and looking at the triumphant faces, I couldn't help but cry in the crowd. As soon as I spoke, I was awakened by a "shameless fellow."</p>
<p>If it weren't for Freud playing tricks, I would have truly admired this naive and lovely dream forever! Even if the ending is too imperfect, I can say it is a tragedy. Otherwise, I would still say it's good that this is childish, and obviously a dream.</p>
<h3>More Rights and Wrongs</h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Zhecun, who has "only a lack of a sense of right and wrong," is actually extremely concerned with right and wrong. Not only that, but he also exaggerates things that were not originally serious, making them more serious. For example, the question of "Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan," what has become of it in today's Japan? Mr. Shi occasionally introduced it, and Mr. Feng Zhiyu occasionally mentioned it in a section of an article about the current situation. None of them are a big deal, and people immediately "forget" about them. But Mr. Shi is too concerned with right and wrong, and he actually stood up to "speak up" for those two books, thinking that they are indeed treasured books that literary youths should have. Then, it is also forgivable for others to express a little bit of their own opinions on right and wrong. Since there was no prior alliance, and the purpose was not to overthrow Mr. Shi, how can a few people's scattered opinions be considered a "siege"? But Mr. Shi actually sees it as a "siege" and says that he has been imprisoned, so he is here to "break out of prison" and "break through the encirclement." Naturally, this is enough to show Mr. Shi's heroism. I think Mr. Shi will definitely achieve the final victory, because the problem has fundamentally ceased to be a problem, and the space for free discussion is also too narrow, who else will come out to block Mr. Shi's path?</p>
<p>However, after seeing "Dissent on the New Discourse on Teachers," I couldn't help but say a few words again, which I am really sorry for. In my article "A Little Dissent," I said a sentence: "The system of mentors in the literary world is about to be restored." And Mr. Shi said in "Breaking Through the Encirclement" that he has no intention of being a mentor and wants me to "rest assured." But even if Mr. Shi really has no intention of this, I still cannot "rest assured." Because I have a very deep sense of grief and indignation towards the revival of the mentor system. My grief and indignation are not only directed at Mr. Shi personally, but at all those who want to be mentors. Mr. Shi has no intention of being a mentor, but others are still thinking about it. Moreover, just like Mr. Shi's seemingly "lacking a sense of right and wrong" is actually meticulous, the reality of not wanting to be a mentor is actually giving literary youths a list of books! What's more, now he has come to "speak up" for "the way of teachers!"</p>
<p>Mr. Wei Mengke criticized the Storm Society. I cannot speak to this "right and wrong," but seeing that the Storm Society is deeply dissatisfied with Mr. Wei, it is only because of the phrase "The Storm Society is a reckless society organized by young art apprentices." It can be seen that the reality of the Storm Society's "not wanting to dazzle with the qualifications of teachers and elders..." is still "wanting to dazzle with the qualifications of teachers and elders." Otherwise, most of those who read Mr. Wei's article would not know that Mr. Wei is a student of the Storm Society, and after reading it, they would only ask whether his criticism is correct. How could they determine that he is a "frivolous youth?" The Storm Society's announcement does not argue from the problem itself, but only raises "the way of teachers" to suppress Mr. Wei. Mr. Shi also comes out to "speak up" for it, which can be said to be like-minded, and Mr. Shi's support for the mentor system can be said to be blatant.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi believes that because of the difference in thoughts and theories, university professors can be thanked, but Enlightenment teachers cannot be thanked. This reason is incomprehensible. Mr. Shi has already seen the "difference" between Mr. Wei and the Storm Society's teachers and students. Shouldn't this "difference" be a difference in "thoughts and theories?" For the same "difference in thoughts and theories," why can university professors be thanked, but Enlightenment teachers cannot be thanked? Do those who have been Enlightenment teachers in primary and secondary schools have such priority?</p>
<p>How the relationship between teachers and students has changed due to the social system, and cannot maintain its original nature, does not need to be said much. Even if Mr. Wei should not have despised his Enlightenment teacher, but actually despised him, that is Mr. Wei's personal matter, and it is by no means "a serious problem in society." Mr. Shi exaggerates this problem so seriously, nothing more than because he has been someone else's Enlightenment teacher, wanting to enjoy a little priority, and also because he has introduced "Yan's Family Instructions" and "Mencius" as the basis for the moral cultivation of young people, wanting to increase the value of these two books.</p>
<h3>Traveled to the Buddhist Kingdom (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, my friend stayed at the temple to sleep, and I went to visit Mount Foding alone. This journey is not short, almost making my feet sore. It is not difficult to walk, but after passing Fayu Temple, I soon went up the mountain. So many stone steps, layer by layer, step by step, continuously, looking up from below, it seems that there is no road, but after finishing a section, a turn immediately reveals a new section. I have been walking for a long time without meeting a fellow traveler, only occasionally an umbrella-hatted monk sitting on a stone bench at the turning point waiting for pilgrims to "form a bond." The road is quite lonely. The surroundings are so quiet that there is no sound. I leaned on the iron railing and kept climbing the stone steps, sometimes seeing a stone bench by the road, and I would rest my feet there. Next to it is the mountain, full of trees, and the sunlight shines on the leaves, plating them with a layer of gold. I only cared about going up, not knowing how high I was from the sea. Sometimes I looked back, and the hillside lay at my feet, completely covered with green trees. At the end of the hillside, there was a patch of yellow sand. The blue seawater was flowing towards the beach, the seawater was so lovely blue, like a piece of satin, but no steamboat came to cut it open.</p>
<p>After passing Leizu Hall and the Buddhist Kingdom of Heaven and Sea, I saw those two steep and strangely shaped large rocks. I didn't know how much further I needed to walk to reach the top of the mountain, and I didn't know what strange things were on the top of the mountain. But I had to continue walking upwards. The higher I went, the more beautiful the scenery below looked. I seemed to be in a cluster of green trees, listening to the subtle music of nature. Next to it were some low mountains, with some smoke and mist on them. I happily thought that the clouds were still below me.</p>
<p>Later, I finally arrived at Huiji Temple, which is also a large temple, but because it is located on the top of the mountain, there are not many pilgrims. At this time, there was no Buddhist service, and the temple was quiet. There were several monks laughing and talking in front of the mountain gate. Seeing me, they changed their faces and shouted loudly, "Form a bond!" I didn't have money to give them, so they laughed. There are probably thousands of monks on Mount Putuo who rely on "forming bonds" to eat. We can meet them anywhere. Some are lying on the ground, some are sitting cross-legged by the road, some are standing in the shade of trees, all stretching out their hands to beg for alms from pilgrims. When they can't get a penny from us, they criticize, "Pilgrimage to the mountain, not forming a bond, it's really strange!" But they don't know that leaving Mount Putuo, there are many more strange things!</p>
<h3>The Two Brothers (18)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Is this a dreamer? A lover? A philosopher, or a happy person, or a sad person? Who exactly is this? He went closer, filled with curiosity, wanting to see the face of this solitary person; he recognized that this person was his younger brother.</p>
<p>"Ah, is it you, Zhe'an?"</p>
<p>"Ah... Bi'er... what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I came to breathe some fresh air. But what about you?"</p>
<p>Zhe'an laughed:</p>
<p>"I came to breathe some fresh air too."</p>
<p>So Bi'er sat beside his brother.</p>
<p>"Don't you think this scenery is extremely beautiful?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Listening to his voice, he knew that Zhe'an hadn't seen anything; he said again:</p>
<p>"As for me, every time I come here, I feel a crazy desire to travel far away, wanting to follow these ships to the north or the south. Just imagine, over there, those tiny lights all come from all over the world, from those countries with large flowers and pale or bronze beauties, from those countries with hummingbirds, elephants, lions, and black chieftains, from all the countries that are described in our fables, even though we no longer believe in things like 'White Cat' (Note 1) or 'Sleeping Beauty' (Note 2). If we could go to these places for a walk, that would be such a happy thing; but this requires some money, it requires a lot of money..."</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped speaking, thinking that his brother now had money, and having money, he didn't have to worry about anything, he didn't have to work every day, he was free and unrestrained, he was happy, joyful, he could go wherever he wanted to play, he could get close to those fair-haired Swedish beauties or the dark-haired beauties of old Havana.</p>

<h3>Financial Short Covering Leads to a Sudden Rise, Gold Prices Rebound by Six Yuan - Unfavorable News Causes Continued Decline in the Market - Quick Rebound Occurs with Improved Sentiment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market fell and then rose, with significant short covering, making the market more stable and almost breaking through the 60 yuan mark. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw increases in both the UK and the US, with forward silver prices rising by 1.4 to 3.5%. Exchange rates rose across the board. London spot gold rose by 1 shilling and 6 pence. The US government's gold buying price was $32.36, up 10 cents from before. Stocks rose by 92 cents, US wheat by 2.25 cents, and US cotton saw a slight increase. The opening of the wool market was initially flat, but Reuters reported that the US Treasury Department would issue silver coin circulation notes worth $11 million, as the UK had repaid a portion of its war debt in cash in June of this year, using it as collateral. Additionally, in the week before October 27th, the Bank of France had been presented with cash worth 75 million francs, due to budget deficits. Although unrelated to the US gold buying policy, there were reports today of the US buying gold from the Bank of France, but whether this was confirmed remained uncertain. These messages caused the price to fall to 45-46 yuan. After opening, the price rebounded sharply due to short covering, rising to 58 yuan. Later, Reuters reported that the US would buy gold domestically and internationally at any time, and the amount purchased could be announced, but the amount and price to be purchased could not be disclosed. The official market announced that the Shanhou Society purchased 60,000 ounces of domestic gold last night, worth 2.1 million yuan, which improved market sentiment again. Reuters continued to report on the US rural relief experiment program, which caused a struggle, and the market went from flat to brisk, almost breaking the 60 yuan mark. However, the market situation was quite mediocre. Exchange rates were approaching 4 yuan and 86 cents, so short positions began to cover, and the market was firm throughout the day, with the contract price at 1125 yuan. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 749 yuan and 2 jiao, a decrease of 2 yuan and 8 jiao compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at 8 yuan and 5 jiao. The exchange market opened with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence and 75, and US exchange at 31 yuan 8125.

Sumitomo sold US dollars for January at 1875, and Hengyu released it and declined. It was known in advance that HSBC listed British exchange up 125 and US exchange up 25. Goods were supplied, retreating to 2 yuan and 7 jiao. Like-minded colleagues were eager to cover short positions, and Hengxing, Shunli, Hengxingyuan, Daxingyong, Yidayong, Fuyuzhengchang and others came to compete for purchases, and the price rose to 58 yuan. US dollars for January were difficult to settle at 32 yuan. HSBC sold US dollars for January at 9375, Bingxing, Hengyu, Shunli and Tongtaichang released it. Then Zhengjin sold January at 32 yuan, Huabi offered US dollars for December at 8125, gradually going downstream but mostly hovering. After entering the market, Zhengjin even sold US dollars for February at 25, Yifengyongyuanheng sold again, and it fell to 3 yuan and 6 jiao and started to rise. Bingxing and Huixiang purchased at this time, and it rebounded to 5 yuan and 5 jiao. Dadecheng, Fuyu and Zhaofengchang sold again, and retreated to 3 yuan and 2 jiao, and the situation was still hovering. Qingfayong, Huixiang and Changshengyong still came to buy, and it rose to 5 yuan and 6 jiao. Hengyu released goods, and the afternoon closing decreased to 754 yuan, with goods auctioned at 3 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 754 yuan and 2 jiao, with goods opening at 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Dadecheng, Bingxing, Daxingyong and others all advanced, and gradually rose from 4 yuan. Tongfengheng limited the purchase. Zhengjin ate February US dollars at 25, and Mitsui immediately ate December US dollars at 75. Daxingyong, Richang, Yuanheng and Hengtai purchased again and rose to 8 yuan and 5 jiao. Zhengjin sold January US dollars at 9375, Bingxing, Hengyu and Zhifengyong released it in the market, and it decreased to 6 yuan and 1 jiao. Magali sold March US dollars at 375, Pan Gen and Zhengjin again paid February at 125, January at 9375. Banks all wanted it, Yongfeng, Hengyu, Fuchang and others came to advance, and gradually rose to 9 yuan and 7 jiao. Sumitomo sold January US dollars at 875, Daxing and Ruixing sold, and it retreated to 7 yuan, but because Bingxing and others came to pay, it still hovered a lot. Changshengyong supplied and still decreased, while Hengxing advanced. After struggling, the closing was 758 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at the same price. It was found that the highest during the day was 759 yuan and 7 jiao, and the lowest was 748 yuan and 1 jiao, with a difference of 11 yuan and 6 jiao. As a result, it rebounded by 6 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 31 yuan and 25 because HSBC Bank's US exchange listing increased by 25, which corresponded to a standard gold price of 768 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 10 yuan lower, which was 12 yuan less than the previous closing. The registered price for this month was 762 yuan, and the registered price for December was 754 yuan. The morning top-up water was 762 yuan, and the afternoon top-up water was 766 yuan. The contract price was 1125 yuan. The Tianjin gang was quiet due to inconsistent positions, and only the Guangdong gang released Dade Zi and sold it to Taikang Run for more than 200 taels, for 1125 yuan and 1123.5 yuan.

<h3>Jiang Jiao Trading Sparse, Continued Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to scarce transactions of Jiangnan Small Foreign, the market price fell by 2 yuan, calculated as 831 yuan and 2 jiao, there was no rise or fall in the early and afternoon markets, making transactions of 5,000 jiao in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong Small Foreign was 786 yuan in the early market and the same in the afternoon market, but there was no slight increase or decrease compared to the previous day's afternoon market, and the market atmosphere was unusually stable. Transactions were 45,000 jiao in the early market and only 10,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper yuan also had no long or short, at 306,000 wen, with transactions of 43,452 strings, calculated as a cost of 14,200 foreign yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market is in a Wait-and-See Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was quite deserted, and market prices also tended to hover and stagnate. Since the major changes last week, the market sentiment has been shocked and gradually weakened. The bulls were far less excited than before, and the market sentiment was quite lazy. Market prices still fluctuated up and down, and the situation was extremely stable. In the morning opening, there were more retail transactions, mostly short position swaps, and market prices unanimously rebounded by 12 jiao to 35 jiao. However, as soon as it rose slightly, there were bulls selling, so the first set of the front row was still relatively stable. The various types of 20-year bonds still decreased slightly by 12 jiao due to selling. In the two sets of transactions, it fluctuated up and down, and the market sentiment was still depressed. In the afternoon opening, it turned hazy again, and the market price suddenly became stagnant, with fluctuations of only 5 fen or 1 jiao. The closing prices were mixed, with no more than 5 fen or 1 jiao. The superficial situation was hovering, but in reality, it was waiting and watching. The arrival of changes should not be far away. As a result, market prices were calculated to have improved by about 1 jiao to 3 jiao, and some long-term varieties still had a slight decrease of 5 fen or 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was calculated to be 1,671,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods, and the futures total supervisory tax was 2,175,000, including 525,000 for demobilization, 880,000 for the 19th Customs, and 1,185,000 for the 20th volume and 20th Customs. The remaining amounts were only tens of thousands to 230,000 yuan. There was no trading for the 18th Customs throughout the day.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market's Foothold is Solid and Steady</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market on the 2nd was still idle, but the foothold was solid and steady, and "wet" stocks were particularly strong. It is expected that the results of the election next Tuesday will ensure the success of the lifting of the ban. The US dollar continued to weaken, and silver prices saw a new high, all of which are beneficial to the bulls. However, because the government's monetary policy is still chaotic, many speculators are watching from the sidelines. It is predicted that the future trend will still be upward. The total daily transaction volume was 1.12 million shares. "Wheat" first rose due to Liverpool's strength, and then fell back due to bull profit-taking and bad news from Argentina. As a result, it was more than 2 points larger. "Cotton" supply and demand were very balanced. Private estimates were larger than the previous session, and southern hedging was gradually scarce, so the foothold was still stable. "Silver" was firm throughout the day, and retreated slightly at the close due to bull profit-taking. The Financial Post-War Society announced that the gold price per tael was 3 yuan, 3 jiao and 6 fen, up 1 jiao and 2 fen. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>
<p>Closing price Compared to the previous day</p>

<p>20 utility stocks 23.20 Also 0.29</p>
<p>40 bonds 82.54 Also 0.07</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower Yarn Market is Dim</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely scattered, in a state of great demand, and market transactions are decreasing day by day, with no signs of revitalization. Generally speaking, speculators are refraining from action because the market is not rising or falling, and the situation indicates a risk of decline. However, a certain firm absorbs existing yarn and closes it off, which is being restrained by it. Future changes cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3>Person Standard Short Covering Slight Rise</h3>
<p>The opening of the Renbiao pre-market was calm, and business on the floor was bleak. Each month rose by 12 jiao. In the afternoon, a small portion covered their shorts, and each month rose by 23 jiao. The total daily turnover was 7,500 bales. It was found that Yuanda sold 800 bales, Yuanfeng 1,100 bales, Shenji 350 bales, Yida 550 bales, and Chongan 300 bales. Hengchang bought 500 bales, Gengfeng 250 bales, Yicheng 300 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, and Deji 250 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Jiangxi 23 Wuhu 10 Mainland 30</p>
<p>Hankou 50 Fujian 10 Guangdong 55 Sichuan 150</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Without Much Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell, but the market was still flat. However, the amount of transactions in November was too large, and there were still 210,000 dans outstanding. There were 20,000 dans of cotton delivered last month, and the receiving party is negotiating due to poor quality. This trend has not yet subsided, so the bulls are even more determined. However, overseas cotton markets are softening, and the price of replacement purchases is trending lower.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Bullish Addition</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng Standard pre-market, there were bulls buying to add positions, and the market was slightly firmer. Each month rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, the market was slightly tired, and each month fell by 1 jiao. The total daily turnover was 32,200 dans. It was found that Chunji sold 1,200 dans, Yukang 800 dans, Yuanda 3,100 dans, Changhe 1,000 dans, Jifeng 1,500 dans, Zhenda 1,000 dans, and Deji 1,300 dans.

<h3>Spot Cotton Sales Still Healthy</h3>
<p>The need for spot cotton is still good. The source is calculated as 1,479 bales of Yao cotton and 2,950 bales of Tong cotton. The current sales record is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>US Cotton Steady, British and Indian Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton market situation was mixed, waiting for the next government report. It first fell due to Southern hedging, and then rebounded due to buying by peers. As a result, spot goods did not move, and futures rose by 1 pound. Liverpool cotton spot goods fell by 2, and futures fell by 45 points. India and cotton spot goods fell by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by retail Japanese merchants, and then fell back due to sales by speculators. As a result, Pingjiaer fell by . Omra fell by 1 rupee, and Bai Luohan fell by 3 jiao and 7 and a half. The original telegram record is on the left (2nd telegram):</p>

<h3>Bulk Transactions in Foreign Wheat Lead to Decline in Standard Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market sentiment was weak due to bulk transactions in foreign wheat. Each factory wanted to sell, but no one had the appetite, so they could not sell as happily as the previous day. However, market sentiment has been greatly affected. The opening price was small. Distant contracts were auctioned in the morning for factory sales, and the price was about 2 points small, and the recent period was a small number of li and about 1 point. In the afternoon, the factory stopped selling, the shorts covered, and the market turned slightly. However, bulk transactions in foreign wheat are expected to arrive in Shanghai. The previous day, Fuxin and Fufeng factories imported three ships of government-borrowed wheat, totaling 15,000 tons, of which Fufeng had two ships and Fuxin had one ship. Yesterday, Fuxin also completed one ship of Argentine wheat at a price of 4 yuan and 2 jiao, so market sentiment was still low. After the first round in the afternoon rebounded, it fell again. The closing prices for November and February were each down 1 point, December was down half a point, January was down half a point, March was down 0.75, and April was down 0.75.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, although foreign wheat rose after the opening in the morning, market sentiment was low due to bulk transactions in foreign wheat. In the morning, all parties sold out, and the price suddenly fell by about 1 jiao. In the afternoon, there was a slight short covering, and there were fewer sellers. The result was that this month still fell by 2 points, December fell by 5 points, January fell by 4 points, February fell by 7 points, March fell by 5 points, and April fell by 6 points. Spot wheat was very firm, but due to transactions in foreign wheat, the market fell. The price of foreign wheat was small, and the spot price fell by 1 jiao. First, Fuxin sold 1,000 bags, and Shenda sold 500 bags. It is calculated that Shandong wheat was 4 yuan, Daqiao was 3 yuan, 8 jiao and 1 fen, Liuhe was 3 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and Heqiao was 3 yuan, 6 jiao and a half to 3 yuan and 6 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Su Tong Japonica Still Firm</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was 30-40 numbers, loading more than 5,000 stones. The Su Tong Japonica Chang Japonica market is still firm, and since the incoming goods are relatively scarce, the outflow is quite strong, with 1,500-1,600 stones, so the market continues to rise. Nangang and other thick rice varieties sold 1,000+ stones and the market was also tightening. There were 2,000+ bags of kiln Zhongliu Zhong Bai Ge and other goods, but because the customer's appetite continues to be strict, the price is difficult to increase. Du Jian's arrival and sales were similar, both totaled about 1,000 stones. The price was not very prosperous. Only 2,000+ stones of the flat tip flowed out, so the market had a slight soft corner. Xin Yinyuan wine households helped to handle 4-500 stones.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 47-48 numbers of goods arrived from Hebei's various roads, the market sales appetite was weak, and the market shape Xin Japonica·Yang·Du·Bu Kexian·Kiln species·Bai Ge· all belonged to the flat and tired format. The Yin Baiyuan price zone was firm, and the broken japonica price increased by a jiao.</p>
<h3>Wen Tai Yong Shao Handle Loaded Du Yang Jian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the customer japonica and foreign rice market conditions were both in a stable situation, but the customerization was still stagnant. The street took this opportunity and had some entertainment, and the market was not very different from the previous market. It is calculated that 462 packages of Jiangxi Chenji rice were released, priced at yuan, 9 jiao to 67 jiao, 195 packages of Nanjing machine rice, priced at 6 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, 100 packages of small shredded rice, priced at 7 yuan and 2 jiao, and 222 packages of Jiangxi early brown rice, priced at 5 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. The Quanzhou gang had no intention of inquiring about various japonica, and tried to handle 200 packages of Wuxi Xinji Yuan for the first time yesterday, priced at 8 yuan and 9 jiao. If this batch is suitable, it will be disposed of again. The Zhejiang provinces of Wen Tai Ning Shao welcomed the new rice this year, and there was an intention to ask about foreign customer japonica, but since the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Du Zi Jian Yang Jian were suitable, the appetite for handling was very active in recent days, so there has been no realization of handling foreign customer japonica.</p>
<h3>Yellow Beans Smooth Sales Flat Market</h3>
<p>The yellow bean market is still not good, and after falling for several days, there is still a lack of opportunities for change. Yesterday, it was small again, 56 points. All gangs inquired, and this street, mainland, Ningbo, Nanyang, and factories were all entertaining. The total number of wheel cargo transactions in the city was about 2,000 packages. Except for the factories with no big appetite unless they are cheap, the rest have weak appetite, so there is temporarily little hope for improvement. The Du beans and Sha yellow bean markets are in a high, flat and sub-tired situation.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>This Factory's Refined White Sugar Reduced by Another Small Half-Cent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed no improvement in sales and continued to decline. The association's quoted price for No. 24 coarse grain white common sugar was 20 yuan and 9.5 jiao per plate, but no transactions occurred. Other types, such as No. 20 medium grain white sugar, Dutch red sugar, and Taikoo sugar, were only quoted, with no activity. The market's weakness is increasing daily. Without an unexpected boost, a turnaround seems unlikely. The price of refined white sugar from our factory, Zhonghua Guohua Zhenji, decreased by another small half-cent. No. 1 was 19 yuan and 6.5 jiao, No. 2 was 4.5 jiao, No. 3 was 2.5 jiao, and No. 4 was 0.05 jiao. Zhonghua's top grade was 19 yuan and 8.5 jiao, and Zhenji's No. 5 was 18 yuan and 8.5 jiao. Only a few dozen packages of Chaoqing sugar were offered, priced at 15 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Daylily Market Steadily Tightening</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of daylilies from various regions have gradually increased, making the market quite active. Prices are becoming increasingly tight. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade goods was 17 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the lower prices. Although no deals were made, the tightening trend is evident. Currently, the market price for top-grade daylilies has exceeded 18 yuan and 2 jiao, followed by prices ranging from 17 yuan to around 16 yuan, and then 15 yuan and 5 jiao. Old daylilies vary in price from 5 to 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>European and American Silk Sales Sink Further into Despair</h3>
<p>Lyon Factories' Price Plunge Due to Exchange Rate Fluctuations: In the Lyon raw silk market, the French franc exchange rate against the Chinese yuan plummeted last month, leading to a nominal price increase but an actual price hike. Although the surface price of Grade A white silk remained at 86.25 francs per kilogram, the price in Chinese currency per bale rose from over 810 yuan to over 850 yuan. Grade B silk was 80 francs, with the price per bale rising from 740 yuan to over 780 yuan, an increase of 40 to 50 yuan.</p>
<p>French Franc's Surge Causes Factory Price Plunge: Although Lyon market prices showed no apparent change (Grade A remained at 86.25 francs per kilogram, and Grade B at 80 francs), the Chinese currency price of Grade A fell back to over 820 yuan, and Grade B to over 750 yuan, a difference of over 30 yuan per bale. Consequently, the sale of factory products to France has become even quieter.</p>
<p>Sparse Shipments of Chi-Li White Silk to Shanghai: European and American sales of Xunlai Chi-Li dried raw silk have completely stalled. Only the lower-grade dried raw silk for printing mills has seen some sales. Shanghai's inventory is abundant, and the source of goods is increasingly scarce. Yesterday, inland steamships only carried 35 pieces of lower-grade dried raw silk from brands like Jinma.</p>
<p>Viscose Sales Increasingly Sluggish: Due to the tense exchange market, viscose sales are struggling, and prices are weakening. Yesterday, only the Yanqing gang imported 20 cases of current and forward goods of brands like Golden Kirin Black Beauty, priced at 179 yuan, about 2 yuan lower than before.</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Sales Increasingly Quiet: The price of gold has plummeted, and the exchange market has surged. Yokohama's raw silk prices have plunged to 700 yen, the lowest record this year, causing New York and Lyon silk prices to weaken in unison. In light of this situation, European and American silk merchants in Shanghai are increasingly unwilling to take risks. The market is stagnant, and sales of foreign-stationed silk are becoming increasingly hopeless.</p>
<h3>Precious Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to England Also Picking Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Tongfu Foreign Firm, an English company, resumed purchasing precious eyebrow green tea from both Luzhuang and Tuzhuang. It is reported that over a hundred boxes of Wuyuan high-grade core-extracted and ordinary goods have been agreed upon, with little change in selling price. Other green teas, such as Gongxi and Xiumei from Baitouzhuang Yulong, Ruichang, and Jiehaozhi, are seeing scattered sales. Except for Wuyuan core-extracted and Gongxi teas selling at 115 yuan, higher than before, the others have reportedly fallen in price.</p>
<p>Investigation</p>
<h3>Cost of Living Index Rises Last Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau recently released the cost of living index for workers' areas in Shanghai, stating that the index for October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, compiled by the bureau, was 97.56, 1.98% higher than the previous month of this year, and 6.09% lower than the same month last year. All categories of the index, except for clothing and miscellaneous items which declined, showed a consistent increase in food, fuel, and other items, resulting in a slightly higher index for this month compared to last month.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Bloody Path for Small and Weak Nations</h3>
<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was persuaded by friends to see "Hot-Blooded Ambition," and I felt lost for several days afterward. It wasn't until yesterday, when I read Mr. Bin Fu's "War's Roar," that my heart felt as if something had pried it open. I felt that the terrible scene—the war—was indeed gradually unfolding before our eyes. My mind flashed like lightning, followed immediately by darkness. This darkness weighed down my heart like a heavy stone, but I still instinctively thought, "How should we resist the invasion and trampling of this unstoppable war?"</p>
<p>Of course, I am not a glorifier of war, nor am I an ambitious person seeking advancement through war. Like most ordinary people, I abhor war. I deeply curse and consider it unfortunate that the Second World War is about to descend. The impression war gives us is simply too cruel. Truly, what good is war for the masses? War is indeed a great authority. It can kill hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of living beings in an instant, as easily as one crushes a group of ants. However, it is precisely because of this unparalleled authority that we only increase our aversion and sense of horror toward it.</p>
<p>However, I believe that we should welcome this upcoming world war with fervent blood. Although I have said that war is a most terrifying demon, it is ultimately dead and lifeless, and the power to wield it remains in our hands. Don't you see that it is like "water and fire"? Water can irrigate fields and sustain human life, and fire can cook food and provide light and warmth. However, there are also floods and fires. I believe war is the same. History has clearly told us that Washington's fight for freedom and independence and Lincoln's Civil War have both achieved the highest glory in terms of national and human values. Can we subconsciously say that we, currently under the invasion and oppression of the great powers, are worse off than the America of Washington's time or the black people of Lincoln's time?</p>
<p>Alas! I really want to climb the highest mountain peak and strike the loudest alarm bell to tell my countrymen that a crisis more severe and terrifying than a flood is about to befall us! This Second World War is nothing less than a final judgment of "the strong survive, the weak perish." How will we struggle for our final destiny—success or failure—in this worldwide gathering of tigers and wolves? Compatriots, don't think that the "September 18th Incident" has stopped. Know that it is just the beginning of an even greater war. Looking back at our China amidst almost every country in the world actively increasing their military strength, I cannot help but feel anxious and heartbroken: our land is shrinking daily, the hearts of our people are becoming more and more divided, and our compatriots are becoming increasingly numb and degenerate! Ah! Friends, stop sleeping like drunken men! Look at the thorns spreading ahead, and listen to the roar of the lurking beasts that are about to pounce! This is no longer a time for hesitation. We must immediately revive the inherent heroic and fearless spirit of our ancestors. If we continue to cling to our rosy dreams, the world war will erupt in your slumber. Are we to be forever buried in piles of thorns? Are we to perish silently and unnoticed? My dear compatriots, let us join hands and rise together! Let us move forward with one heart! There is no you or I, nor is there any separation between us. How will we wash away our past shame? How will we carve out a bloody path for ourselves and for all small and weak nations amidst the hideous faces of imperialists? I believe that there is only one path for small and weak nations, and that is a path forged with fervent blood. I further believe that the power of the masses can defeat the demons who specialize in using force to conquer and oppress other small and weak nations. Struggle! Now is the time. The Second World War will resolve everything for us—success or failure?</p>
<h3>Answering Mr. Zhi Jun's "Service First Doctrine" Regarding the Article "Talking About Occupations"</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>The other day, I read Zhi Jun's "Service First Doctrine," a response to my three-day commentary, "Talking About Occupations." He was so overbearing and unapproachable that I initially intended to remain silent, allowing discerning readers to judge the right and wrong. However, to explore the essence of this issue, I now take up my pen again.</p>
<p>Apart from an entire section and numerous scattered sentences in Zhi Jun's article that were irrelevant and simply aimed at scolding me, the rest used the current abnormal phenomena to justify his view that "occupation is for the sake of eating" and that "occupation is an activity arising from the need to obtain the means of livelihood, with the sole object being economic." He purely used abnormal facts to overthrow my theory, without pointing out any errors in my theory itself.</p>
<p>If we only focus on the abnormal facts of the current society, stagnate at the current stage, and quibble over details, then I would bow my head in admiration of Zhi Jun's wise opinions! However, matters are never that simple, and theory is never that straightforward. Because Zhi Jun failed to foresee these things, his writing became an emotional outburst, and his arguments became so dogmatic and biased.</p>
<p>I not only recognized the abnormal and contradictory nature of current society but also acknowledged that occupation has become a huge problem. There is no occupation to speak of; in fact, it is simply impossible to find one. I wrote this at the beginning and end of my article: "In the present situation of the dual intensification of a withered rural economy and a depressed urban market, occupation, which is closely related to this, has long since become a huge problem. Many people circle outside the realm of occupation year after year, ultimately unable to find a job or secure a position, forming a panic of mass unemployment leading to wandering and starvation. What occupation is there to talk about?" and "Ultimately, it is extremely difficult to seek an occupation nowadays, except for those with the skills to 'flatter' and 'brag,' and who have powerful backing." However, humans are progressive, striving, and searching for light. Are we truly willing to stagnate at this abnormal and deadly stage? Because I made the above declaration, it is clear that I was elaborating on a correct theory, an occupation in the new stage we hope for. In theory, the explanation of occupation is naturally this: "Occupation is a necessary and essential life activity for human beings, with the purpose of resolving life's needs and promoting human society." The respect one should have for occupation is as follows: "One is the meaning of humanity, one is life, and one is how to live. Because to live, we need the provision of clothing, food, and shelter. Because we need the provision of clothing, food, and shelter, we need life activity... Today, there are indeed many people who, relying on the private property system... can live comfortably without working. But this is clearly a distortion of the meaning of humanity, a pathological social phenomenon whose collapse is inevitable and will arrive in the near future. Therefore, human beings should have an occupation." Furthermore, regarding the close relationship between occupation and life, "It must have permanence and must closely follow life like a shadow every day." Therefore, choosing an occupation must take into account these three conditions, and then "it is inevitable that talents will be suitable for occupations and occupations will be suitable for talents," and that should involve "respect, enjoyment, and perseverance." Zhi Jun did not point out the errors in my theory, specifically where they were wrong. Since there were no errors in reason, Zhi Jun should recognize that my article was searching for light, crossing over this abnormal present stage, and establishing a theory aimed at the society we desire and a rational occupation. I dare to ask, in our ideal society, should an ideal occupation be like this? Light follows darkness, and ideals follow reality. Although we are currently rolling in a dark reality, we are also urgently in need of rolling into a bright ideal.</p>
<p>Zhi Jun might ask: theory cannot be separated from fact; they are one family. However, some theories are not so rigid, but instead advocate for new facts, just as we are now promoting the realization of a rational new society where everyone should have enough to eat. This is a theory that everyone agrees on. Can Zhi Jun say that this is not relevant to the present facts, that it is deception, and overthrow it with the fact that everyone is being exploited and starving? Can it be overthrown?</p>
<p>Who does not publicly acknowledge the various abnormalities and contradictions of the current society? But are we truly so unlucky that we will always stagnate at this deadly stage? Zhi Jun, human beings are searching for light, and we are seeking a rational occupation!</p>
<p>I am honored that Zhi Jun has bestowed upon me the high hat of "writer," but I am ashamed to accept it. I respectfully offer Mr. Zhao, who has flattered me in this way: "So I began to speculate that this writer must have rented a room for thirty dollars a day to write this great article, or at least he is certainly the master of a three-story 洋房 with a south-facing window – otherwise, how could he be so like he is biting on mint-flavored sugar and feeling the air of his brain fresh and cool?" I have almost memorized it (to use Zhi Jun's words), and I am also learning to speculate that Zhi Jun must be an experienced person, otherwise he would not be able to describe it so intimately! As for myself, I feel flattered and deeply comforted in spirit, and I gain some knowledge, knowing that there are rooms in Shanghai that cost thirty yuan a day. I actually got Zhi Jun to promote me to staying there for a day. It was so comfortable inside, and then I wetted my brush and wrote a "commentary" for this magazine, earning back one-tenth of the day's rent. Moreover, after having a room, I became the owner of a 洋房, very fortunate, very fortunate. However, the facts are quite inconsistent. To be honest with Zhi Jun, because I cannot get rid of the various burdens of my family, I can only live in a middle room in a war zone and a slum, and I share it with a friend. There is a front living room (made of the courtyard) in front, and a back living room in the back. I live in the middle, with four panel walls that are not ventilated, and I stay up late every night catching bedbugs. I once made a box of "I haven't breathed air for a year," a self-portrait of my life, but I ultimately felt that it was my own incompetence and ugly behavior, and I didn't dare to send it out, so I tore it up. Now, I am full of thoughts about climbing, if Zhi Jun has leisure, there is a good opportunity to invite him to come and play, see the real situation, and then maybe we will talk heart to heart, and say the same thing: "We are all people who have been squeezed dry!" (I presumptuously say "we," thinking that Zhi Jun's life is probably not so embarrassing)</p>
<p>Finally, I am a humble young man, and if Zhi Jun is willing to give me strict guidance and not hesitate to frequently encourage me, that is what I most admire and appreciate.</p>
<h3>Sister A-Jin</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>In less than a year, Sister A-Jin's life has undergone three major changes, from farmer to worker to "merchant," even she herself is baffled.</p>
<p>She used to be a semi-animalistic child bride in her hometown (Wangjiaji, 18 miles from Siyang County). Last July, the Huai River embankment broke, sentencing her in-laws' already unsustainable peasant life to death. Several acres of land, not enough to feed a family, became a (temporary residence) for fish, turtles, shrimp, and crabs. The two dilapidated houses, which originally barely kept out the wind and rain, only had one-third remaining, floating in the boundless turbid current. This disaster, bestowed by "Heaven," ended Sister A-Jin's life as a farmer. Everyone in her in-laws' family was on the verge of starvation, and all their belongings were scattered. Her father-in-law said many nice things to people, and finally an old伙夫 on a steamboat only took one yuan as a price to bring A-Jin to Shanghai using the method of "covering yellow croaker." Her only hope was to entrust her aunt, who worked as a nanny, to find her "work."</p>
<p>Regardless of the wage, as long as there was work with food.</p>
<p>First, her aunt guaranteed her and took her to a job agency to find an employer. Sister A-Jin also squeezed among a large group of strange women of different ages, sitting at the entrance of the agency waiting for "business." After a few days, she was sent to a three-person family to be a "small maid." Every day, she mechanically did work such as emptying spittoons, changing diapers, scrubbing floors... etc. One day, she was leading the young master to play in the living room, and the "young master" came back. Seeing that there was no one else in the living room, he actually "acted freely" on the small mounds rising on Sister A-Jin's chest, causing her face to burn and her heart to beat for half a day. In bewilderment, she also felt a little weightless. She was a little scared, but it was as if something was playing tricks in her blood vessels. She seemed to have some hope for the reoccurrence of that terrible scene. However, after she had only worked for over twenty days, the "young mistress" declared that "this 'little demon' doesn't know how to do housework," and it would be better to hire an older nanny! Thus, Sister A-Jin's life as a "small maid" came to an end again. As for the wages, when she "weighed her wages" on the third day of her trial period, they had already been "divided four-six" by the agency and her aunt. She only received four "wine money" (eight 开) from the young mistress when she left.</p>
<p>After living half-starved for more than ten days, listening to her aunt's many curses and complaints, the god of fate dragged Sister A-Jin to a yarn factory in Yangshupu again.</p>
<p>She worked in the "flower picking room." Although it was already late autumn, the factory was still often filled with sultry air, dust, cotton flocs, and many invisible small fibers, mixed in the air, not only invading her and every worker's nostrils, throats, and lungs. The cold rice, sealed in tin cans, was fermented by the sultry air, and when it was taken out for lunch, eight out of ten times it had a sour taste. Moreover, gray-black dust and fibers were spread on the rice like "meat floss." She gritted her teeth and forcefully stuffed this "coal" for "two-legged machines" into her mouth, while thinking in her heart that the "rice" in Shanghai was not necessarily better than the thin corn porridge cooked in her hometown.</p>
<p>She saw that foremen and clerks were mutually "flirting" with the female workers who were born relatively beautiful, sometimes even reaching out and moving their feet. After she understood the explanation, she understood that touching a female worker's face with a hand was called "eating tofu." When these "scenes" were reflected in her eyes, she recalled the actions that the "young master" had done to her chest when she was a "small maid." She was at a loss as if she had lost something. A heat from her heels to the top of her head surrounded her blood vessels, burning very strongly. At this time, Sister A-Jin began to feel that in addition to working, eating, and dressing, she had other needs!</p>
<p>Under the constant influence of what she saw and heard, and the tension of her physiology, Sister A-Jin also learned to "flirt" with the male workers or the street hooligans who followed her. After several "flirtings," fate made a factual conclusion in her life history: she was persuaded by a man who had "flirted" with her several times to open a room.</p>
<p>After a few times of satisfaction, the man used sweet words to discuss with Sister A-Jin: life in the factory is not worth doing, go to the entertainment venue to be a "hostess." Soon, this propaganda became a reality. Sister A-Jin also abandoned her worker's life and started a "hostess" life with a different flavor. The man who opened a room with her gradually disappeared from "not coming for a long time" to completely disappearing. However, Sister A-Jin, who had undergone a "social education" at the entertainment venue, did not feel like she had "lost love." She only felt that the man was "too unconscionable." She comforted herself: "Men always have fewer good consciences." As a result, for the need for spiritual and material things, she began a life of "accepting everyone, regardless of whether they are familiar or not." She seemed to have changed from "worker" to "merchant."</p>
<p>Under the life of a "public bus," a germ that she could not see or name invaded her blood vessels and body from the bodies of many "anonymous" men. These small animals multiplied day by day. Sister A-Jin had progressed from bone pain, red eyes, and burning palms to the final stage. Her face and neck finally started to "bloom"! The director of the entertainment venue immediately turned a livid face and told her: "Be sensible and find another kind of business yourself!"</p>
<p>Wandering on the street in confusion and grief, she wanted to go to her aunt, but she was afraid of "not having the face to see people." From the water shortage at home to her dismissal as a "small maid," she had already felt that the "road" people were walking on was becoming narrower and narrower for her, and it seemed that there was only one line left. And now, she couldn't even see a line, it had become a black patch.</p>
<h3>Prank</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>This may be a definite theorem: female students always sit in the front row. Therefore, female students will not discover the pranks that male students do.</p>
<p>Ping, the most mischievous, happened to sit in the second row. Therefore, he often reported to his classmates after class that a certain lady's snow powder was thickly applied, that a certain lady's hair was well permed, and other news. Ping would not pay attention to the teacher's explanation. He most liked to draw quick sketches of the female classmates.</p>
<p>Once, he drew the back view of the classmate sitting in front on the notepad. Chen, who was sitting next to him, said that he drew well. So Ping added a quick sketch of Chen next to the drawing, with the words: "Congratulations on success."</p>
<p>Chen smiled and snatched the drawing to put it in the book.</p>
<p>So Ping continued to draw another one. Chen gently</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting of Modern Celebrities</h3>
<p>Landscape painting by Mr. Kuang Youhan: Kuang Youhan, also known as Shaomin, is from Lingui, Guangxi. He is the son of the late Ci scholar Hui Feng. He is good at composing lyrics and writing landscape paintings.</p>
<p>said: "If you come up with a prank to make the male classmates laugh, three chicken cakes, a cup of milk."</p>
<p>Ping agreed. He wrote a few words on the notepad and gently hung the paper on the collar of the female classmate sitting in front. So Chen laughed. Because of Chen's laughter, all the students in the class turned their eyes to the back of the female classmate.</p>
<p>The paper said four words: "I love A-Liu"! Everyone laughed because A-Lu was a small cook in the school, and he looked terribly ugly.</p>
<p>The female classmate did not know what was happening, and did not turn around. Until the end of class, the female classmate was still running to the reading room with the paper, so the laughter became even louder!</p>
<p>Ping was smiling as he bit into the chicken cake. Chen raised his thumb to him and said: "Damn, you really have it!"</p>
<h3>Why Cry!</h3>
<p>— Of</p>
<p>Crying is truly the most annoying thing. Usually, when children cry, I hit them. The more they resist, the more they cry; the more they cry, the more I hit them, until they dare not cry anymore, cannot cry anymore! Making their crying lose its purpose.</p>
<p>I've heard people say: crying is an expression of "sadness"; but I admit: crying is a manifestation of inner "helplessness". Therefore, crying is absolutely a "showing weakness," which is cowardice, incompetence, or even a sign of aging and decline! Would someone with ambition, principles, courage, and ability, constantly striving forward, resort to "crying" when they occasionally hit a wall?</p>
<p>Imagine someone whose home is robbed, house is burned down, and parents and wife are murdered by bandits. At this time, instead of using his own strength to settle the score with the robbers, he just lies by the roadside crying pathetically, desperately crying to everyone he meets! Crying like throwing away his life, even if he cries himself to death, will everything he lost be restored to him? At most, he'll only get some irrelevant so-called sympathy from passersby. If, in my heart, I imagine this fellow crying in front of me, I would definitely curse him harshly first: "You worthless thing!" And then hit him! Really, the only way to deal with someone who cries is to hit them! Hit them until they dare not cry anymore, cannot cry anymore! Finally, make them realize that "crying" is useless, and even foolish and</p>

<p>idiotic.</p>
<p>A hilarious and lively "National Games" has ended. I heard that when the athletes were all happily receiving shiny silver cups and gold medals, some people actually cried. According to a Nanjing dispatch on the 23rd: The four outstanding swimmers from Liaoning, Shi Xinglong, Shi Xingma, Shi Xinglu, and Shi Ruisheng, after the National Games closed, all the athletes returned home with "smiles," but they alone had no home to return to. Although they won championships, they could only look at the trophies and "weep"... In order to awaken the people and recover lost territory... This weeping, although not a loud wail, looking at their sorrowful words, it seems like they are about to cry loudly. For the Shi gentlemen, what future changes? It will also be difficult for the intermediaries.</p>
<p>This action is certainly very meaningful and thought-provoking. However, when Chinese people, who are sad, good at crying, and love to cry, see this, their noses will run and they will shed tears profusely. Naturally, there will be many such people, and I'm afraid there won't be anything more practical than that! Therefore, here, I would like to tell the Shi gentlemen: this aging and deaf nation, even if you cry until you are a tearful person, it will not feel it. Moreover, your crying is at least a sign of weakness and worthlessness! Given your situation, if you truly understand your great responsibility and need to vent a little, why cry? You should still shoulder your great responsibility and work hard! At least, settle the score with the enemy. Otherwise, if you are always crying and weeping every day with tears hanging on your faces, you will soon belong to the group that will be beaten.</p>

<h3>Responsibility for Father's Debt</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a small clerk in a factory, with a monthly salary of a little over ten dollars. In August of the 19th year of the Republic of China, my father, because my two older brothers were not progressing and addicted to smoking, divided the property into four shares, one for each of my four brothers. The debts my father owed were also divided into three shares: one for my father and one for each of my two older brothers. My younger brother and I were not given a share of the debt because we were young and had no means of supporting ourselves. Unexpectedly, my father died of illness in January of this year. Now my two older brothers are still as unmotivated as before. Not to mention asking them to repay the debt, they can't even take care of themselves. So all the creditors are coming to me to collect the debt. Sir, I earn a salary of a little over ten dollars. Besides supporting my elderly mother and young brother, where would I get the money to repay the debt? It really puts me in a difficult position! Sir, I am now slowly taking over my father's share of the debt, but according to the current law, am I not responsible for my two older brothers' two shares of debt? Sir, you are a bright light in the darkness, a compass for the youth. Please do not hesitate to offer your valuable advice to this poor insect. Sincerely wishing you</p>
<p>Good health, Yao Jianmin</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The key to resolving this matter depends entirely on whether the creditors were notified and agreed to the division of property using legal procedures at the time of the division. If they were not notified at the time, or even if they were notified but did not agree, then according to the Civil Code, a person's inherited debt should be jointly borne by the heirs. In this case, since your two elder brothers are unable to pay, you have the responsibility to bear the entire debt. If the creditors had expressed their agreement at the time and had clearly analyzed and individually undertaken the debt, then from a legal standpoint, this debt has been transferred to your two elder brothers and your father. Now that your father has passed away, it is extremely reasonable for you to acknowledge his share of the debt.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (62) (A Four-Act Play)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act Four: Where to Go? Scene Two</p>
<p>Soldier A: They're here, cutting the barbed wire.</p>
<p>(Our army begins firing with rifles and machine guns. After about two minutes, the enemy begins running down from the mountains, jumping into battle. Death, stiff and prostrate. But because the numbers are uneven, the rebels retreat, abandoning the trenches. The enemy takes advantage of the victory and pursues. The enemy occupies the battlefield. The trenches are momentarily silent. Soon, the rebels counterattack, the sound of killing shaking the sky, from far to near. The rebels approach the trenches from the right of the stage. The dead lie everywhere. Soon, the stage is silent, only the moans of the wounded are heard. Our army collects the corpses. Japanese soldiers who are not dead are stabbed to death with guns, and the corpses are gradually carried out of the trenches. Many of the rebels are too exhausted and rest on the ground.</p>
<p>Soldier: (Seeing Soldier A) Hey, good fellow, you're not dead yet?</p>
<p>Soldier A: That's right, you're not dead either!</p>
<p>(At this time, the east is turning white, and a weak red light shines down from the top of the mountain.)</p>
<p>Soldier A: Look, is it dawn now?</p>
<p>Soldier: Is it? We struggled from darkness to dawn, but, friend! Look how many of our people died!</p>
<p>Soldier A: Our people? Don't worry, we have plenty of our people, lots of them! We can't all die, we can't all be killed! You wait and see, friend! We'll take advantage of this red light and rush forward, kill! Kill into the imperialists' lines!</p>
<p>Soldier C: That's right, it's dawn now, and soon the red sun will come out. Since we didn't all die in the dark, we must take advantage of this moment to climb to that high mountain, cross the Great Wall, and take back our lost territory!</p>
<p>Soldier A: Brothers! Fix bayonets, let's charge!</p>
<p>Everyone in unison: Brothers! Fix bayonets, let's charge!</p>
<p>Soldier B: Charge! Kill!</p>
<p>Everyone in unison: Charge! Kill!</p>
<p>(At this time, the red light shines strongly from the mountains. The bugle call of the charge resounds throughout the sky, the brave men leap out of the trenches, shouting loudly, and one by one desperately run towards the mountain. The enemy's machine guns sweep like a string of pearls, and many are hit and roll down from the mountain. But one falls, another follows, and some who fall still struggle to charge forward. Finally, a few people occupy the summit of the mountain, shouting loudly.)</p>
<p>Voice: Come on! Brothers, charge up!</p>
<p>Everyone in unison: Kill! Kill! Kill!</p>
<p>(Curtain falls quickly) End of the play</p>
