<h3 id="c18">東北問題與世界各國　光 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>世界大戰以前的問題在歐洲，在大西洋；國際間的糾紛在歐洲，而亞洲非洲的殖民地市塲爭奪戰縱然是問題的前端，是爭執的對象，但是核心還是在歐洲，爭奪的關係還是以英，德，法，俄，匈奥，等大國爲主體。海上航權的爭鬭是在大西洋，而後洋（南北美）諸國是歐洲的寳庫。到大戰當時歐洲的發達自然是到了頂點，即大西洋東岸的發展到了極頂。歐戰期中，美國暴興發揮他所有天賦的能力。一躍而執世界金融的牛耳。</p>
<p>可是自從大戰以後，國際的情勢，就發生了巨大的變化，太平洋成了世界競爭的大舞台：日美兩國的對立，英美的不調和，法國想在遠東開拓地盤，加以中國民族運動的抬頭，蘇聯的發展，沒有一件事不是互相衝突的。尤其是瀋陽事變之後，更惹動了世界各國嚴重注意，適値經濟恐慌深刻化的時期；在日本是要借向外發展來渡過他國内的難關，提起他人民原始的侵略心理；同時他又知道在一九三一年末，一九三二年初的時候，英美各國都正在集注其全副精神於市面之回復，所以無論用什麽暴烈手段對付中國，列國都不會出實力來干涉的。中國的力量如何，他是相當的了解，他知道中國也在極度困難之中掙扎，决難集合全力去對付他。所以他占領遼吉來試試風色，然後進一步攻擊錦州。英國素來是非常審愼，對遠東問題的考量尤其週詳，初意以爲日本决不敢吞噬東北，只要經濟利益不受損失，則他當然袖手旁觀。美國在九一八事變當初，還不甚相信這事件會繼續擴大，及至日軍侵占錦州纔於一九三一年十二月二十四日對日本發出警告、但仍不能絲毫阻止事件之擴大，一二八上海事變發生，且侵及於國際市塲，美國在華市塲沒有特殊根據固然感受威脅；即英國也很憔慮長江一帶市塲的被侵蝕：所以一月三十日英美聯合對日提出抗議，但中注意到英美人民生命財產之安全，和租界的正常狀態，并不曾提及如何消滅侵略戰爭或阻止戰爭。當時美國憤努最激，但也不過止於憤怒而已，上海戰事之後，連憤怒的程度也减低了，其原因：第一是美國國内經濟恐慌之深刻化，第二是歐洲各國對美非但不調和而且頗有衝突的意味，第三是美國現有的軍事實力還不能和日本開戰，美國也沒有和日本開戰的必要和决心；所以他雖然很憤怒，却是再不能有進一步的表示。蘇聯之於北滿，本有唇齒相依之勢，如果日本帝國主義在北滿得逞，中東路沿線當然要非蘇聯所能支配，西比利亞也要感受嚴重的壓迫；但是他一則要顧忌到資本主義各國聯合對他，况且他正在努力於五年計劃之完成，所以只要日本軍隊不越過蘇聯境界，侵入西比利亞！則蘇聯總是採取極端的冷靜的旁觀態度，看日本兇横到什麽程度，看日本衝突如何變化，看日英怎樣携手，然後再决定他的外交政策。其實蘇聯的審愼，週密，機警，頑强，在外交的策略上并不後於現世界任何國家。</p>
<p>上海砲聲震天的時期，二月二日軍備縮小會議在日内瓦開會，參加的計有五十五國，與會人員有一千幾百個，眞是空前的盛會。其目的不用講是要縮小軍備，但是我們就開會當日的情形，單以侵略上海單爭，東北繼續流血的事實而論，足以暴露這次會議的巨大矛盾。根本上早就是一種裝門面的故事，第一是法國的安全保障和德國的軍備平等要求彼此對立；第二是日美在太平洋上的爭霸，特别是日本正在擴充他的潛水艦艇，美國又堅持［門户開放，機會均等］實際是要强大的海軍力作後盾的，况且英國對這種局面也并不放心，新嘉坡的築港并未鬆弛；第三是蘇聯的五年計劃，人都相傳他特别注意於重工業是在乎軍事工業之發展，歐洲各國以至於日本對此豈能放心。何况主要各國都努力於軍備的充實：飛機，坦克車，遠距離砲，袖珍軍艦··等等都是十分銳利的武器。加以東方的日本竭其全力於軍事，處處發揮他軍事冒險的鐵腕，雖不直接挑戰，至少是用鐵手揑破和平，用機關槍阻著和平的前路。所以軍縮會議的聲勢雖大，終於被上述堆積如山的矛盾所阻滯，甚至連華盛頓條約，倫郭海軍協定那樣子的條約也無法成立。</p>
<p>歐美各强國在軍事上固然不容易找到妥協的方案要圖一時的緩和，減輕軍事費的担負，也是勢非容易；假如能在經濟上尋出新的調和方案來未始不是一個彼善於此的方法。原來牠們在十二月十日國聯行政會議就準備好了，在東方尋求經濟的出路，國聯調查團東來，說是爲了中日衝突，而出以公正的態度，調查滿洲事變的眞相。可是國聯調查團東來的時候，在日本却費了十二天，到中國首先在上海登岸，於上海，南京，漢口，宜昌，萬縣等地方又費了二十五天的時間，北平又費了十天，到四月二十纔往東北計費了四十四天工夫去調查。六月五日以後是編輯報告書的時間。調查團報告書的内容，（世界各處都有了批評，本報也曾加以公平的批判，茲不贅述）。我們只就該團先在長江流域和北平盤旋，就知道其眞意何在了。所以調查團報告書的結論是要把［滿洲］置諸國際顧問會議指導之下。很明顯的是圖國際間的調和特别是現世界主要和國（美國的暗不尤爲有力）要日本實行［門户開放］，［機會均等］的宣言，把日本對［滿洲］的所攫得的權利將一部分讓出來分給各國，則過剩的商品得到新的市塲經濟恐慌有重見轉機的希望。但是日本所倡導的［門户開放］原是緩和列國積極干涉的手段；等到外交形勢緩和了，牠又會把［門户開放］的話吃回去，而主張［東亞門羅主義］了。於是調查團的調查僅止於調查，再找不出别的意義和作用來。</p>
<p>因此，日美的對立，却愈見明白，英美的關係又欠圓滿，歐洲也醖釀着危機。特别是十年來世界所公認的癌腫，對德賠欵自一九三一年六月美總統發起賠欵支付延期，一年以來，世界經濟不但沒有變好，而且連好的希望也很少：德國反而更加厲害，以失業工人而論從前年六月的四百萬到今年六月竟增加到五百五十萬。所以賠欵會議乃於六月十六日在洛桑開會，經過幾度的商量，賠欵雖未完全免除，而世界的癌腫却已切開；在名義上賠欵改名爲歐洲復興基金，數目减去了三十分之二十九，并且還須到三年之後市面恢復，再行賠償。洛桑會議决議案第五項還附以由國際聯盟召集世界經濟會議一條丨對通貨問題，關稅問題，以及戰債都要在世界經濟會議塲中找出解决的方案。雖然附帶得有戰債如不削減，則洛桑條約須重新復議；但這明明是一種對付美國的手段，於洛桑條約實際上不會有什麽大影響。洛桑會議時代，縱然有種種不協調的情勢，其大體上歐洲各國總算一致，英法固然同其步趨，德國也很了解國際政治的關係，而相對的讓步；就那時候一殺那間的景象看資本主義眞有要復興的象徵。　　從洛桑條約（六月二十九日）晟立到英帝國經濟會議（七月廿一日）時間不過一月，而協調的精神差不多分散完了。誠然渥太華所議的是英帝國以内：英本國和各自治領，殖民地間政治上經濟上的問題：但是英國抛棄了牠歷來傳統的經濟政策丨丨自由貿易主義，而採取保護貿易，更有一個特殊的現象，就是大英帝國的經濟聯盟。這一聯盟的影響，在英國本國姑置勿論，對世界各國特給予莫大的刺激：東方的日本於是想併東北三省而成［日滿經濟聯盟］：美國自必更加强　的美洲［門羅主義］；法國一時雖不能復活歐洲經濟聯盟，却更加醉心於自給自足的鎖國主義；蘇聯本來就是另自的一個系統，十五年的爭鬥</p>

<p>越是加緊　獨自建設社會主義國的努力。况且殖民地之民族資本已漸次抬頭，南美洲各國的革命運動，印度的醒覺，中國民族的潛滋暗長，都是現世各國綜錯複雜對立的激劇現象。</p>
<p>於是乎所謂資本主義各國聯合反俄的話，究竟成了宣傳多過一切的事實。固然我們承認資本主義各國對蘇聯確有惡意，確實是不願意蘇聯的存在，但是對蘇聯這塊未來有望的市塲，還是注意這塊市塲的開發，所以除了美國之外，幾個大國都和牠有了尋常的外交關係，和商務往來，即是美國出有商業上的關係，則是所謂反俄也者，其實際比較資本主義各國的互相對立，（如德法的對立，法意的對立，美日的對立）還要緩和得多。八月中旬的日蘇漁業協定，繼之以日蘇煤油協定，再繼之以松岡洋右過莫斯科時的活動日蘇諒解。尤其重要的是法蘇兩國的［互不侵犯條約］，繼之以波蘭與蘇聯的互不侵犯條約；就一方面看這似乎沒有什麽很重大的意味，但就另一方面看則法蘇之間打破了十五年來的隔閡。法國將由防俄轉而爲與蘇聯發生較密切的商務關係，於波蘭亦然；至於蘇聯呢！則從此西線平靜。總而言之，資本主義各國對蘇的戒備縱不能沒有，（即使有也和資本主義國家彼此戒備相似，無足爲異）而反俄運動至少是緩和了。</p>
<p>可是在另一方面，英法兩國原來是一致的，爲了償還到期戰債却背道而馳，法美之間爲了戰債更發生巨大的風波。甚至美國參衆兩院都提議報復法國的手段，這種經濟上的糾紛，使法美國交上發生裂痕，對恢復市面更有不良的影響。英法的步調旣異，法美關係惡劣，意大利和南斯拉夫的發生爭執，換言之就是法意對立的惡化，這些情形，縱未必發生嚴重的結果，至少會影響到世界經濟更難於恢復。而失業工人的增加，市塲的窄小，鎖國主義的經濟聯盟丨丨自給自足之盛行，是一九三二年國際間的第一特色，爭奪市塲，主張利益均霑和獨占的鬥爭是第二特包。（一九三二年十二月卅一日）</p>

<p>九一八事變後。遼寗設臨時省政府於錦州。日方視耽欲逐。久思翦食。自犬養内閣成立。荒木貞夫繼任陸相。對我侵略。益趨積極。英美法駐日公使。先後政牒日政府。勸其避免錦州衝突。日政府覆稱無攻錦意。暗中則儘量布置對錦軍事。二十年十二月下旬。大批日機轟炸錦州附近。先後攻陷盤山溝帮子。至二十一年一月二日。而錦州遂告失守。日軍旋復進佔連山綏中。沿錦朝綫爲侵熱之舉。阻於義勇軍。不得逞。日人爲欲分散我國人士之注意力計。一方增兵東省。一方復在滬積極挑釁。遂以釀成一二八之事變。（關於滬戰經過詳見另篇茲不贅）迨二月上旬。哈爾濱復爲攻陷。日人至是遂欲實行期傀儡政策。利用漢奸臧式毅熙洽張景惠等。擁溥儀組織所謂滿洲國。建僞都於長春。溥儀於三月九日就僞執政職。發表宣言。日人並嗾令强接海關。截留鹽稅。馬占山本以抗日著績。在爲組織成立之初。曾一度虚與委蛇。接受僞職。及四月初旬。乃潛赴黑河。通電抗日。並宣布僞國由日陰謀成立之證據。時各地義軍蠶起。首領如丁超李杜馮占海王德林等。皆與馬氏互相聯絡。或稱救國軍。或稱自衛軍。分頭活動。一致抗日。倐而瀋陽吃緊。倐而哈埠被圍。名都大邑。迭經克復。義軍聲勢煊赫。日人疲於奔命。七月下旬。僞國强行接收東北各郵局。同時日軍復一度向熱河進兵。藉口石本案。派飛機轟炸熱邊村鎭。列强以日人氣燄暴張。對之亦殊側目。美國務卿史汀生曾一再聲明不承認武力造成之東北地位。日本則悍然不顧。一意孤行。而對美之惡感亦益甚。八月上旬。日任武藤信義爲關東軍司令。本莊繁則調回本國。同時復以武藤兼充駐滿特派大使。並通告國聯。爲承認僞國張本。至於九月十五日。遂不顧一切。正式承認僞滿洲國。雙方簽定日滿議定書。僞國並宣告海關獨立。迄乎九月。駐中東路蘇炳文護路隊反正。佔領滿洲里。抗日形勢爲之一振。蘇馬互通聲氣。進逼齊齊哈爾。日軍屢遭挫折。日軍部乃訓令駐瀋軍隊。對義軍應以收買與武力並用。同時復陸續武裝移民片東三省。藉增實力。一面則再三誘說蘇炳文。與作和平談判。蘇氏嚴予拒絶。撑時多日。卒以機彈缺乏。糧食不濟。不得已退入俄境。至是日軍自謂北滿不復足慮。遂欲一意進圖熱河。本文屬稿時。邊形勢。正極緊張。前途如何。殆難逆測。彼以封豕長蛇爲懷。具鯨吞蠶食之志。不予遏阴。寗有止境。國人其猶不急起直追謀最後之抵抗者。覆巢之下。無完卵矣。</p>

<p>很艱難的，而又很僥倖的，在昨夜一九三二年又從恐佈與破滅的邊緣上溜過去了，到今朝，資本主義的國家的每一個政治家金融家和企業家，似乎都可以帶着含淚的笑臉互相道賀，［，呵感謝上帝，我們又從艱難中掙扎地廣過了一年。］</p>
<p>然而過去了的一九三二年，并不曾爲這世界帶走恐慌的惡運，新來的一九三三，也未見得就是這世界［運轉鴻鈞的象徵。歷史早已爲這世界安排好了一個［歸宿，］在目前，世界便如像在一個無底的黑暗洞裏艱難地掙扎。不掙扎到黑暗的盡頭，决不能望見黎明的晨　。這就是說，一九三二雖說從昨夜僥倖地溜過去了，但目前，我們仍並未臨到一個可以［破淚爲笑］的年頭。</p>
<p>我們試取過去的一九三二年所遺留在我們眼前的事實，作一個輪廓的檢視：　　第一，從經濟的見地說，一九三二是世界經濟恐慌發動後的第四年，當然無論從那一方面觀察，都只是恐慌的深入與危機的加緊展開。只就全世界的失業羣衆說，據美國商務部發表統計，在歐州三萬一千萬人口中，失業者爲一千一百三十七萬八千人，美國一萬二千三百萬人口中，失業者爲一千一百四十萬人。又據國聯勞工局長多瑪在年度報告中指陳，在世界失業危機中，每二十八人内，有一人之生存方法被剥奪。從這鉅大的失業數字中，我們已可以顯明地看出世界經濟恐慌之深入。</p>
<p>而且，此種數字，還是經過了聰明的政治家們的［製造，］它是折扣後的殘餘，而不是眞實的數目。我們只看目前無論是世界富藏所在地的美國，或是資本主義先進國家的英國，或是素稱和平之瑞士國，無不是一片啼饑號寒的慘呌聲，無不是一片［要求工作，要求麵包］的怒詈聲，倫敦曾被二千五百個飢饉行人兩次威脅過，華盛頓曾被歐戰退伍軍人和饑民隊包圍過，就是世界的政治家外交家們集議［和平］的［日内瓦和平之城，］也發生過流血慘劇。嗟怨聲，努詈聲，和自發的［生存爭鬥，］已普遍了資本主義的世界。這嶄然的事實說明了什麽？不是更進一步的顯示了資本主義深重的病症嗎？不是說經濟恐慌已在資本主義的世界掀起了恐怖騷動的黑潮嗎？</p>
<p>然而你却不要眞的爲上述種種事實所欺騙，以爲這世界是眞的［窮］了，告訴你，世界并不窮，而且正感到十分的過剩呵！儘管一方面有千萬人在啼饑號寒，而另一方面，則正有人在將大量的牛奶傾諸河流，大量的米麥付之一炬，資本在庫裏睡着，貨品在堆棧裏堆着，他們和飢寒的羣衆，恰是以正比例增高其數量，飢寒的羣衆高呌［無出路，］它們也是在高呌［無出路，］誰說這世界窮呢？但就另一種意義上看看，又誰能說這世界不窮呢？事實上大多數的人羣，不是已經陷入飢寒交迫的悲境了嗎？</p>
<p>這世界就是這樣地在玩着［滑稽］和［矛盾］的魔術，然而你看，那魔術的扮演者的手不是在發抖嗎？不是在戰慄嗎？</p>
<p>這是一九三二年的世界經濟的一個輪廓。</p>
<p>○　　○　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>擱下世界不說，我們且再來一檢閱我們國内。</p>
<p>談到我們國内，眼前亦感覺得一切如像一團紛亂的絲，不知應從何處說起。從外患一方面說，很顯然的緊接着前年的九一八禍變，情形是一天一天的變壞，東北義勇軍已漸呈失敗之勢，馬占山部退守一隅，蘇炳文部也退入蘇境，馮占海部亦不能自支。他們所以失敗的原因，同是［彈盡糧絶，］［後援不繼。］熱河現在又在告急了，華北也是風聲鶴唳，人心惶惶。這事實是說明了什麽？它是明白地指陳：趁着經濟恐慌的狂潮，日本帝國主義者對我國正積極地實行砲艦政策，而此種侵略行動，又實爲列强所默契。雖說到去年年底，爲了外交情勢的迫切，中蘇終於正式恢復了邦交，但在事實上，此一外交政策之實行，早已錯過時機，故目前仍並未能獲得任何的成就。</p>
<p>次之，從内政方面說，一九三二年我國内政的特徵，第一是内亂之繼續爆發，始有粤亂，魯亂，繼有川亂，黔亂，在粤亂中不敢抗日的飛機，曾大顯其身手，［飛鷹］便是這樣的犧牲了。又在魯亂中，據報載刧後掖縣視察記，謂［斷井殘垣，一片瓦礫，百年精華，毁於一役，］其荼毒之慘，已可想見。在川戰中，人民所遭受之荼毒尤慘，江津瀘州資中成都諸役，無辜人民死亡達三千餘人，戰區商業損失達七千餘萬，其他直接之損失，尤無可數計，即以成都巷戰一週而言，繁華市街，都化爲一片焦士，文化機關，摧殘殆盡，學生死亡，爲數亦逾千人。黔亂之損失，目前雖尙無統計可徵，但就粤亂魯亂川亂之荼毒而推斷，當亦不難想見，</p>
<p>復次，從經濟方面說：每年對外貿易的入超，是早已成爲鐵一般的事實，不過今年更要多點，據國際貿易局統計，今年入超統計，至少在六萬二千萬關兩以上。再說社會經濟，那更是［不了！］前年水災，農村已破毁無餘，而去年豐收不僅不能贍人民之死亡，反益以加速農村之破滅，在各種原因的總和之下，農村自更加速破產，農業主要產品如絲桑，破落已不堪言。更有一極顯明之事實：江蘇在我國夙稱富饒之區，但據調查，全省中之四十三縣，共有三百四十五家當典，共有資本一千三百六十餘萬，但仍不是應付，農村之貧苦，已可想見，蘇省如此，他省寗尙堪問。</p>
<p>總結一九三二年的中國政治經濟，確呈一種病症，不過，我們認爲診治一種病症，先要知道病根所在，自身有病，自身知道，這是無須　言的。此時就是中華民族生死的關頭了。未來世界的浩刧，和中華民族的末刧，只有迎上前去，衝破這黑浪，才有出路。現在我們提出幾點，作爲我們一九三三年的新年獻詞。</p>
<p>一·有計劃而能堅苦實行的政府和民衆，才能在這經濟恐慌的世界裏跳出來，走向繁榮的前路。蘇聯第一次五年計劃的成功，第二次五年計劃在今日之開始，就是一個楷模。</p>
<p>二·在一種嚴密計劃之下，使大衆能各盡其力，各盡其能，而且人人是爲社會盡其力盡其能，才能獲得大效。不能與民衆打成一片，不能運用民衆的偉力，這恰爲自取滅亡之道。</p>
<p>三·領袖須奮其爲民衆犧牲的精神，以偉大人格，發揮其光明的態度，負荷此政治的重責。民衆亦須以自力奮鬭，方能獲得自由，而决不能希望他人的恩賜。</p>

<p>日本旣如此亟亟備戰、關於軍需工業最重要之金屬工業、機械器具工業、化學工業三種工業、於其本國全產業中、究佔若何之地位、頗有注意必要、據日本工商部昭和五年度（一九三○年）調查全國各工業之工廠數職工數及生產額、有如下表</p>

<p>化學工業合計　　三三二九　一一八、二六０九０一、八二二</p>
<p>據右表、可知在金屬工業中、以鐵精鍊·及銅精鍊業生產額最鉅、在機械器具工業中、則以鐵製船舶業最鉅、在化學工業中、則爲礦質肥料業·石鹹·及化裝品製造業等、生產額最大、而此等化學工業、亦最易轉變爲軍需製造業、其地位殊未可漠視、</p>
<p>自東北事變以後、因軍需工業加緊製造之故、不獨軍需工業本身頓有特殊之進展、其他有關係工業、亦交沾其惠、工人工資、一般有增高之趨勢、在資本主義行將沒落途中、忽有軍國主義之激剌、而呈此�光反照之佳良景象、彼日軍人方且欣欣以爲得計也、而陸軍軍費四億四千七百八十萬元、海軍軍費三億七千二百六十萬元、合計在八億二千萬元以上占國庫支出總數百分之三十六而强、軍費之膨漲爲日俄戰爭以來之第一次、而此外還有滿洲事變費預備金一千萬元、及一週以前、熊本第六師團全部調赴［滿洲］換防之開拔發兩千萬元日金、尙不在内、</p>
<p>此此種巨大軍費内、用之於軍需工業者、陸軍部方面一九三三年度支出一億　元、約當本年度之兩倍、内務·農林·工商·各部之時局匡救費、合計則亦一億六千萬元、軍需工業、必然的突轉佳象、據日本銀行本年九月份之調查、全國重要產業就業工人指數、九月份爲七四·八、佔本年最高額、較之最低之一月份指數七二·九、增一·九、較上年同月份增○·五、而此種增加率、大部屬之軍需工業方面、如機械製造業、較之上年同期增百分之九、器具製造業增百分之七·六、金屬品製造業增百分之一·三、橡皮製造業增百分之六·九、他方面工資指數、亦同樣增高、據日本銀行調查、機械製造業本年九月較上年同期增百分之八·一、船舶製造業增百分之二·六、車輛製造業增百分之一·三、器具製造業增百分之二·一、其中惟金屬品製造業稍有低落傾向、但低落之程度、亦殊輕微、就一般情形而論、軍需工業之工資指數、顯然在全產業中有特著之增長、一覽而知、其有心比武、實爲東方之第二德意志也、處此情景、令遠居異域之旅館生活者、西望祖國、不勝感喟、不知世界合國、對此擾亂和平者、果作何處置也、（一九三二·十二·二十六日於東京）</p>

<p>孫科發表談話云、民國以來、國步艱危、民生凋敝、未有如今日之甚者、國人方太息長嘆、日坐愁城、一若束手待亡、無可奈何也者、殊不知國難　　、而人心　未　死、救亡之道正多、　　後作　　之　　已　乎、此　之所以於今年元旦、仍不能不爲一言、以昭告國人、兼以自勉也、吾黨　政數年、國人之所期望於吾黨同志者不可　不　、而吾黨同志朝夕　力於　　　業者亦不可　不　、　　　其功效、計其日力、則不徒　人　有　言、多致不滿、卽吾黨同志清夜捫　、反躬自問、又何嘗不惶惶然　汗無極乎、求其　以爲無他、要在缺乏團結之［誠心］而已耳、試以數年來之政治情形觀之、其所以糾紛層出不窮者、莫不由於吾黨同志間之互相猜忌、以致小之則　　各存歧志、而系派之鬥爭緣之而起、大之則因權利之衝突、演成政政潮之起伏、而戰禍乃卒不能不因之而綿延、於是主義無由而施行、建設無由而推進、而民生疾苦、則有增無已、外患内憂、更相繼而來矣、東三省之喪失、又不過爲其惡果中之尤著者耳、旣知紛亂之源、在於國人缺乏團結之誠心、則吾人爲糾正以往之錯誤、舍一致開誠布公而外、别無他術、可以補弊救偏也、此言在表面上觀之、或似唯心之空論、不切情事之宜、而悉心體察、證以實際之　結、則當不復以空論置之、夫吾國有四萬萬之衆、人民之多、舉世無匹、而其力乃不敵一蕞爾小國、則以其爲一盤散沙、數量雖多、何能經狂風驟雨之摧殘而不敗乎、中國國民黨者吾國惟一有組織有主義有歷史之政黨也、而數年以來、派系雜出、力量分散、以致破碎支離、爾詐我虞、同志方互相殘殺排擯之不睱、尚何能集其心思才力於主義之推進、所以共匪猖獗、而無法肅清、帝國主義者之侵凌、而無法抗禦、固有由矣、故吾人惟望全國人民、咸能剔除自私自利之心、則猜忌之情立免、猜忌之情旣免、則團結之力可固、團結之力旣固、則自衛之能自强、猶之一盤散沙和以粘質、斯堅强牢固之塞門土、可立而待其成、蓋［誠心］猶粘性之質焉、誠心不具、則團結不固、此吾人之所以斤斤於［誠心］一端者、固非無的而放矢也、</p>
<p>顧上之所述、乃係抽象的、苟徒有誠心、而無具體的事實以繼之、則去救亡之道尙遠、所謂具體的事實者何、卽應採何種制度、方足以適合全國國民誠心之表現、方足以適合全國國民團結之趨向、使整個民族之動作、預爲周密之策劃、使全國人民之心思才力、感能貢獻於國家之生存、民族之繁榮、而後國運之復興、乃能倍增其速率、昔者總理嘗規定革命之程序、爲軍政訓政憲政三個時期、今軍政時期旣了、訓政時期、亦已試行數年、成效何如、吾人姑不具論、第在此國難當前、必須集中國力、共救危亡之頃、自應採取最適合集中國力之制度、余於今春曾提出［抗日救國綱領］、主張於最短期間、結束訓政籌備憲政之開始、此次三中全會復本其意、提出集中國力挽救危亡］一案、亦以籌備憲政開始爲其前提、業經全會之通過、自可按步進行、良以數年來之黨治、　受政團之影響、效率低微、國民　望旣深、而本黨之信仰、亦不　漸致　失、以致國力無由集中、外　不克抗擊、斯固非其黨同志始料所及、亦非　　目前緊急環境之良策、此余之所以毅然以促行憲政爲補救之方也、然吾人　一面籌備憲政之開始、同時對於訓政時期未盡工作、仍當加緊進行、庶一方可以使黨治告一段落、而他方又能達集中整個民族力量之目的、内則清除共匪、外則抗禦强敵、以復興中華民族之運命、自求生存之至計、</p>
<p>顧憲政之實現、其艱鉅尤較軍政訓政爲甚、苟國人以爲一經憲法之制定、公布施行、卽可垂手而得憲政之良果、乃屬大謬、蓋在國民政府準備憲政開始之前、國民黨同志對於憲政之設施、所負之使命、固屬倍增、而全國國民所負之責任、亦較前爲重大、訓政時期工作之良否、尙可諉爲國民黨之責任、而憲政成績之好惡、則全國國民共負其責、不復能有所諉卸也、故國民必須提起全副精神、注意政治問題、同時以正當方式充分表現其意志、在消極方面、要能防閉政治上舊有之罪惡、使腐惡勢力不能抬頭、而在積極方面、更應督促政府、進行建設事業、以解除民生疾苦、然後始不負憲政之美名、與夫提倡實行憲政之初意、苟重蹈民國初年之覆轍、徒爲政客搗亂之機會、則非吾人所望於國民者矣、雖然、苟有人執此以難憲政之實行、則又陷於因噎廢食之病矣、亦猶爲父母者見孩童之學走者、偶一試之而顛躓、遂戒其勿再嘗試、則是孩童者且終不習走矣、是豈爲父若母者所當持之態度哉、雖至愚亦知其必不可矣、今之提倡憲政、其義亦然、固不得謂其當招顛躓、而竟終不令期嘗試也、要之則視吾人維護扶持之力如何而已耳、</p>

<p>廿八日被綁險遭不測卅一日脫險幸未受傷</p>
<p>華東社云、全國各界救國團體聯合會常務理事張軍光·突告失踪、現已於昨晨三十一日出險、消息傳來、莫不欣喜、華東社記者聞訊、即趨法租界張寓探訊、適張宅全家外出未遇、後經氏之未婚妻周詩華女士、導至滬西某醫院、始得與張氏晤見、作半小時之長談、承告</p>
<p>被綁經過　等甚詳、據談、渠於二十八日上午十一時許出外、赴銀行公會晤林康侯先生、旋即辭出、由北京路乘十七路無軌電車至四馬路畫錦里口下車、向東步行、擬至中西藥房、接洽該會特刋之廣告、詎行不數步、即有身材魁梧之大漢二人、突出手槍、挾之以去、斯時渠已知事不妙、然左右腰際手槍緊逼、已無掙扎之能力、祗得隨之而行、轉灣至麥家圈一横路内、即駛出一汽車、被挾之登入、戴以墨塗眼鏡、車即駛去、然渠已不見一切、祗聞車外有電車聲及輪船之嗚嗚聲、車行良久、即被挾入一屋、拘禁一室、四不通風、亦未聞若何聲息、入晚、一婦人進以晚餐、恐有他故、雖餓亦不食、</p>
<p>次日下午　此二人又來、仍戴以眼鏡、挾之入汽車、行駛更遠、車外亦無呌囂之聲、良久始被挾入一小船、反縛其雙手、令其臥於艙内、船蓬緊蓋、絶不知身居何處、艙内首尾、亦有人把守、予以飯食、簡陋不能下咽、入晚、忽有一人至、與船尾之人私語良久、不甚清晰、似云此人［對的］、明日可領錢去、臨行又一再叮嚀、囑其小心看守、</p>
<p>三十正午　爲渠被綁之第三日、一切情形、一仍其舊、並無若何變動、下午、一人又至、看守者即訊錢領到否、答曰、未、恐須待明日矣、曰、是則可以下手矣、答曰、［慢］、待得錢後下手不遲也、稍留片刻、又行矣、此時渠已深知生命已危在旦夕、亟思脫逃之法、顧看守森嚴、實難漏網、環顧左右、苦無善策、正當焦急之際、忽見篷上挿一小刀、似江北小販用以削荸薺者、渠即詳加考慮、入夜、寒氣逼人、臥於艙内、瑟索作抖、看守者因連日勞頓、精神甚覺疲乏、咸皆瞌睡、渠即乘此良機、將被反縛之手、於刀下漸漸細心反割、約二三小時、始將束縛解除、正欲匐伏出艙、船口年守之人、忽出外小便、立於船首、斯時渠即不動、摒氣躡後、用力向其後猛推、跌入河内、即</p>

<p>丨沈亦民君來函丨</p>
<p>十二月二十七日貴報［讀者顧問］欄内所發表的朱嬰君的信，其中有一句話我有點懷疑，他說：［·····又卽或找着工，然不是工廠受時局的影響而關門，便是由於生產合理化的結果使你一天精疲力盡而得不着一飽。］照朱君的意思。生產合理化便是他［一天精疲力盡而得不着一飽］的根本原因；其實不然。我們曉得，生產合理化内容不外是：㈠有極科學的方法組織工廠，使各部門的關係簡單化，在物質上和時間上盡量地節省，或用同樣的時間和物質生產比前加多生產品；㈡盡力地革新機械，使從前十人的勞動力或百人的勞動力的生產品，現在只以一人或十人的勞動力便可產生出來；㈢晋遍地使工廠電器化、從前十人或百人管理的機器，現在只需一人或十人而已足；㈣　運輸和交通都電器化和機器化的支配之下，俾生產品和材料之輸運異常迅速而又極省人工與時間。就合理化的木身說，並沒有罪惡；罪惡在於專爲商品而生產的私有制度、在私有制度的生產社會中實行生產合理化、其自的只在增加商品的生產；加緊勞動力的榨取；極力節省生產手段；盡量地消融蓄積資本，結果只是生產過　工廠倒閉，就形成所謂［人口過剩］工人失業。然而這不是說，生產合理化在現社會中、一施行便有這種現象，乃是說牠發展到一定程度時　必然發生更大的經濟恐慌，我們看美國的生產合理化與德國生產合理化的結果、便可明瞭。然而我們從現存的私有制的生產社會中的生產合理化，却抽出一個相反的結論，就是：在更高的，新的生產關係的社會裏面，這種生產合理化便是百分之百的需要，而且是一個必要的條件；所以在更高的階級上的生產合理化的第一個必要條件就是：縮短勞動時間。爲什麽要縮短勞動時間呢？爲的是要增高勞動者的文化程度，使他們以大部份時間，享受精神上的幸福與高等敎育，因爲在這種社會中，生產已經不是爲商品而生產，乃是爲生產者自身的消費而生產；蘇聯的計畫經濟也就是透露了此一端倪。鄙人恐怕朱君因咀咒現在社會的生產合理化並將來合理社會的生產合理化而亦厭惡之，反對之，那就大大地危險，用爲一言以質朱君並就敎於貴記者，其亦有當於萬一否耶？幸有以敎之。</p>
<p>覆：來書　發生產合理化精義，極有見地，大可補朱君之所未發。朱君身在病中，深受資方壓榨之苦，　於一時感懷，　不　　冷靜精密的分析。足下所言，朱君當亦首肯。但是這裏還要補充一點，就是生產合理化本是商品生產社會的生產方法的最高表現，但是這一最高的生產方法到了一定程度便與牠所從來的生產關係不相容，結果牠就替這一生產關係所形成的社會組織掘下了墳墓，［請君入　］，便從牠的毌胎裏破框而出、做了更高階叚的社會組織的［寗馨兒］，質之高明以爲如何？</p>
<h3 id="c123">㈡［餓死］問題 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>丨孫敬仁君來函丨</p>
<p>貴記者在本月十九日答覆　君說：［只要吃得苦，總不會餓死，］這話我有點懷疑。我們若果爲勉勵人努力進修，不要安坐而食，說出這種話來。到有片面的理由，也可以相當原諒發言者的苦心。然而在現在社會中，這種話　實在不足爲訓，因爲現在已經餓死，或正在要餓死，或將來必然會餓死的人，大都是願意［吃苦］，着實吃得苦］的人，而那些席覺履厚，驄馬高車，　奢淫佚的人，十九都是不能吃苦，不願吃苦，專以人之［吃苦］供他的犧牲的。就拿我做比罷。我從早到晚在店裏做十二點鐘以上的工，旣要替東家管賬，又要給他去跑腿；旣要替拭檯子掃地，又要給他做買賣。除了吃飯，睡覺，鎭日價一點兒閒空　沒有，然而我不過每月掙得二十塊錢工錢，除了我的衣食住，便沒有養活我母親的了；要養活我母親，我便要餓肚了。但是我還是幸運的依然有二十塊錢一月、其他願意吃苦，其能吃苦，然而到處找不到工作的人，以上海而論，就不下幾十萬。他們旣沒有工作，張梁的只好做賊，做綁票，懦弱的那只有投黃浦自殺了。所以我的是這樣：餓死的不見得是不願吃苦，或吃不得苦的人；而不餓死的，也不見得都是願意吃苦或吃得苦的人。恰恰相反。并進一步觀察：現在的社會一方面是在極力給人造［苦］，一方面又極力給人造成不願吃苦而［身安逸樂］的機會。是否有當？敬質萬明。</p>
<p>記者按：關於我們答覆翁君所問經濟困難［年入二百餘元，家有六七口，負債三千餘元，年關將届，如何應付？）一問題（翁君原函與我們覆函見本月十九日本欄）曾承朱嬰君先後兩次來函，同我們作精細的討論。（見二十二日及二十七日本欄）朱君之意，以爲我們不應該不明白地告訴翁君：這是整個社會問題，而祗是含含糊糊地呌他去［吃苦］關於這點，我們已於兩次覆朱君函内，加以說明，就是我們在答覆翁君函内，已經說明這是整個社會問題，不過措詞稍爲隠約而已。現在又接孫君來信，對於我們呌翁君［吃苦］的話，繼續有所糾正，雖然孫君的意見，朱君已經說出，而措詞之痛切，較朱君則尤過之，我們除以十二分誠意接受孫君的指示外，更無他說話可說。在此，我們一方面是更希望一般吃盡痛苦而不得一飽或願吃苦而無苦可吃的人，都能有一個澈底的覺醒，問一問爲什麽大多數人吃盡痛苦而不得一飽，或願吃苦而無苦可吃？爲什麽少數人並不吃一點苦而得［安富尊榮］？對於我們肩頭上的重大責任，都能加以一個很明晰的認識！同時，孫君旣然對於我們當前的嚴重問題，有如此明切見解，又肯不憚煩的同我們詳細計論，我們是更希望孫君以後能夠源源見敎。</p>

<p>（十）建國的的唯一方法［工役］</p>
<p>實行敎育建設以後、物質上的建設、當然亦極重要、但是物質的建設、需用人工極大、要在幾時期中促其實現、那末非實行普遍的工役不可、工役應分爲兩種、一是軍工役、一是農工役、</p>
<p>吾國現有軍人在二百萬人以上、每年用百分之八十的國家收入來養兵、實爲目下最耗國力阴阻碍建設的一個大敵、古工式的［養兵千日用在一朝［的國防方法、我認爲極不經濟、并且飽暖而無所事事、易於發生私　、與其用編遠方法來減少養兵的費用、不如實行軍工役比較的有利而易辦、依照建國在網的政策、由協會的專家指導之下、責任各省區軍事長官、在這十年救國時期中、先行完成最重要的幾種生利工程與生產事業、包括鐵道·公路·橋樑·運河·水堤·船塢·等工程、及發電·造林·開礦·及重工業製造等事業、留小部國軍來擔任國防、用大部軍人來盡力建設、其結果、㈠可以消弭内戰、㈡可以减少軍費、㈢可以實行建設、㈣可以使全國軍人亦盡些救國的義務、</p>
<p>軍工役的建設工作、是屬於重大而團緊於一處的、而爲一種特殊事業的建設、要在十年中繼續不斷的工作、農工役的工作、是要分散於全國的村中、各個村中的農民、擔任各個村中的事務、每年在農閑時節的冬令、由政府的命令、協會的指導、與敎師的督促、實行農工役、第一期爲整　理村道開闢村路、第二期爲開河·種樹·遷墳·除蟲、第三期爲建造本村的公共塲所與房屋、但農工役最好於敎役實行二三年後施行、因爲到那時候、全國的農民受了敎師的啟迪薫陶、至少得到些相當的公民常識、或者至少有一部份的農民、可望其自動的參加、</p>
<p>至於農民方面的粗織、應當責任全國各縣縣長、會同各自治區區長、聯合各村組織敎育救國協進會、再由政府發一命令、大意如下、</p>
<p>［限於三個月内、全國各縣、由縣長協助中大學生組織各縣敎育救國會、再限於六個月内由縣長召集各自治區區長、組織各區敎育救國協進會、協助中大學生開辦學校、及勸導農民子弟入學、］</p>
<p>（十一）衛國的唯一方法［兵役］</p>
<p>我們决不能放棄天與我們的富滬、與宜耕宜牧的氣候、我們更不能放棄祖宗傳與我們的廣土衆民、我們决不能讓日本或歐美任何國家來　我們的主人、我們决不要殺人、但是也不許人家來殺我、我們决不要奪人的土地、但是也不許人家來奪我的土地、我們不但要在人與人之間得到平等、并且要在國與國之間得到平等、但是若要履行以上的幾個條件、那末我們沒有偉大而有組織完全的兵力、不能成功、所以我們必須要實施兵役、方可以使國家獨立而生存、但是這二十世紀的新軍人的資格、必須要有敎育的培植、科學的知識、軍事的訓練、與道德的修養、四者缺一不可、所以我主張這兵役實行的年期、至少要在敎役實行五六年以後、因爲到那時候、至少要有數百萬人、有資格的來做受過敎育的新軍人、再有數十萬人、有資格的來做受過訓練的新軍官、</p>
<p>所以我們的第一步的工作是救國、第二步的工作是建國、第三步的工作才是衛國、因爲目下的軍事要有四種原素、一是兵、二是將、三是物、四是心、換句話說、就是一是有受過充分運事訓練而勇於用命的軍隊、二是要有全才而經過大戰的大將、參謀的人材、與各種事務的領袖、三是各色的戰鬭器·軍用品·化學物料·電器用品·以及運輸的設備、都要完備、四是偉大團結的民心、於兵力物質、均可擔任補充、所以在戰時可以見人民勤奮的服務於公衆、在工廠中有日夜不停的製造貨物、所以當今科學化的軍事運動、至</p>
<p>少要有十年的全國上下充分的預備、必須要於生產·製造·敎育·軍政·完備以後、才可以對付科學昌明軍實充實的敵國、所以我極端贊現政府暫時屈服另求出路的政策、所謂保全實力以圖最後的勝利、所以我主張兵役要在五六年後來實行、也是這個道理、因爲感情用事、毫無用處、</p>

<h3 id="c158">冬至之晨殺人記 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>孔子曰上士殺人用筆端，中士無人用語言，下士殺人用石盤。可見殺人的方法很多。我剛會一位客，因爲他談鋒太健了，就用兩句半話把他殺死。雖然死不死由他，但殺不殺却由我，總盡我中士之義務了。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的。我雖不信耶蘇，却守聖誕，即俗所謂外國冬至。幾日來因爲聖誕節到，加倍鬧忙，多買不應買的什物，多與小孩打滾，而且在這節期中似乎覺得義應特别躱懶，所以中國評論報［小評論］的稿始終未寫。取稿的人却於二十分鐘内要來了。本來我辦事很有系統，此時却想給他不系統一下。我想一人終年規規矩矩做事，到這節期撒一爛污，也沒什麽。就使中國評論報不能按期出版，中國也不致就此滅亡罷？所以我正坐在一洋鐵爐邊，夢想有壁爐觀火的快樂，暫把胸中掛慮，一齊付之夢中爐火，化歸烏有，飛上青天。只因素來安分成性，所以雖然坐着做夢，却時時向那架打字機丢眼色。結果，我明曉大義，躱懶之心被克復了，我下决心，正在準備工作。</p>
<p>正在這趕稿之時，知道有文章要寫，却不知如何下筆，忽然門外鈴響。看了片子，是個陌生客。這倒呌我爲難，因爲如果是熟客，我可以恭祝他聖誕一下，再請他滾蛋。不過來客情形又似十分重要。所以我呌聽差先告訴來人。我此刻甚忙，不過如有要事，不妨進來坐談幾分鐘。他說事情非常緊要。由是進來了。</p>
<p>這位先生，穿的很整齊，舉止也很風雅。其實看他聚珍版倣宋的名片，也就知道他是個學界中人。他的顙額很高，很像一位文人學者。但是嘴巴尖小，而且眼睛渺細，看來不甚呌人喜歡。她手裏拿着一個紙包。我已經對他不懷好意了。</p>
<p>於是我們開始寒暄。某君是久仰我的［大名］而且也曾拜讀過我的［大作］。</p>
<p>［淺薄的很。先生不要見笑。］我照例恭恭敬敬的回答。但是這句話剛出口，我登時就覺不妙。我得了一種感覺，我們還得互相回敬十五分鐘，大繞大灣，才有言歸正傳的希望。到底不知他有什麽公幹。</p>
<p>老實說，我會客的經騐十分豐富。大概來客越知書識禮，互相回敬的寒暄語及大繞大灣的話頭越多。誰也知道，見生客是不好冒冒昩昩，像洋鬼子［此來爲某事］直截了當開題，因爲這樣開題，便不風雅了。凡讀書人初次相會，必有讀書人的身分，把做八股的工夫，或是桐城起承轉伏的義法拿出來。這樣談話起來，呌做話裏有文章，文章不但應有風格，而且應有結構。大概可分爲四段。不過談話並不像文章的做法，下筆便破題而承題；入題的話是要留在最後這四段是這樣的，（一）談寒暄，評氣候，（二）叙往事，追舊誼，（三）談時事，發感慨，（四）所要奉託之［小事］。凡讀書人，絶不肯從第四段講起，必須運用章法，有伏，有承，氣勢旣壯，然後陡然收筆，於實爲德便之下，兀然而止。這四段若用圖書分類法，亦可分爲（一）氣象學，（二）史學，（三）政治，（四）經濟。第一段之作用在於［坐隠］符於來則安之之義。［尊姓］［大名］［久仰］［夙違］及［今天天氣哈哈哈］屬於此段。位安而後情定。所謂定情，非定情之夕之謂，不過聯絡感情而已，所以第二段便是叙</p>
<p>舊。也許有你的令姪與某君同過學，也許你住過南小街，而他住過無量大人胡同，由是感情便融洽了。如果，大家都是北大中人，認識志摩，適之，甚至辜鴻銘，林琴南····那便更加親摰而話長了。感情旣洽，聲勢斯壯，故接着便是談時事，發感慨。這第三段範圍甚廣，包括有：中國不亡是無天理，救國策，對於古月三王草將馬二弓長諸政治領袖之品評，等等。連帶的還有追隨孫總理幾年到幾年之統計。比如你光緒三十一年聽見過一次孫總理演講，而今年是民國二十一年，合計應得二十五年，這便呌做追隨總理二十五年。及感情旣洽，聲勢又壯，陡然下筆之機已到，於是客飲茶起立，拿起帽子，兀突而來轉入第四段：現在有一小事奉煩。先生不是認識○○大學校長嗎？可否請寫一封介紹信。總結全文。</p>
<p>這冬至之晨，我神經聰敏，知道又要恭聆四段法的文章了。因爲某先生談吐十分風雅，舉止十分雍容，所以我有點準備。心坎裏却在猜想他紙包裏不知有何寳貝。或是他要介紹我什麽差事？話雖如此，我們仍舊從氣象學談起。</p>
<p>十二宫星宿已經算過，某先生偶然輕快的提起傅君來。傅君是北大的高材生。我明白，他在叙舊，已經在第二段。是的這位先生確是雄才，胸中有光芒萬丈，筆鋒甚健。我完全同意，但是我的眼光總是𢌞後射在打字機上及他的紙包。然而不知這樣，我們的感情果然融洽起來了。這位先生談的句句有理，句句中肯。</p>
<p>自第二段第三段之轉入，是非常自然。</p>
<p>傅君，蜀人也。你瞧，四川不是正在有叔姪大義滅親的厮殺一塲嗎？某先生說四川很不幸。他說看見論語半月刋（我聽人家說看見論語半月刋。總是快活，）知道四川民國以來其有四百七十七次的内戰。我自然無異辭，不過心裏想：［中國人的時間實在太充裕了。］評論報的傭人就要來取稿了，所以也不大再願聽他的議論，領略他的章法，而很願意帮他結束第三段。我們已談了半個多鐘頭。這時我覺得呌一切四川軍閥都上弔，轉入正題，也不致出岔。</p>
<p>［先生今日來訪，不知有何要事？］</p>
<p>［不過一點小小的事，］他說，打開他的紙包。［聽說先生與某雜誌主編胡先生是戚屬，可否奉煩先生將此稿轉交胡先生。］</p>
<p>［我與胡先生並非戚屬，而且某雜誌之名，也沒聽見過，］我口不由心狂妄的回答，言下覺得頗有中士殺人之概。這時劇情非常緊張。因爲這樣猛然一來，不但出了我自己意料之外，連這位先生也愕然。我們倆都覺得啼笑皆非，因爲我們深深惋惜，這樣用半個點頭工夫做起承轉伏正要入題的好文章，因爲我的狂妄，弄得毫無收塲，我的罪過眞不在　延踢倒七星燈之下了。此時我們倆都覺得人生若夢！因爲我知道我已白白地糟蹋我最寳貴的冬至之晨，而他也感覺白白地糟蹋他氣象天文史學政治的學識。</p>
<h3 id="c159">新年停止辦公三天 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 葉聖陶</p>
<p>新年停止辦公三天，旣經通過，又說［通令全國一致辦理］，一切服務諸君有三天［白相］是一定的了。</p>
<p>前一些時曾見報上登過，新年慶賀等舉動一概免除，理由是如今仍在國難期中。好像也有過新年照常辦公的主張。若問爲什麽，小學生也能回答，無非［國難方殷］［工作緊張］之類而已。這與逢到國恥紀念日吃一天素的辦法是一貫的，統而言之，就是臥薪嘗膽］。</p>
<p>吃了苦頭，彼此愁顏相對，原是人情之常。但愁顏要與堅决的實行力和切實的希望心同時並存纔有意義。如果愁顏而外。别無其他，那只有一輩子愁下去。便是愁死了，誰來理睬你呢？</p>
<p>講到工作，通常總說進行好，停頓不好。譬如一位木工，他停了一天工作，就少製成兩把椅子，如果不停，就多製成兩把椅子：工作停頓，效率就减低，所以不好。然而未可一概而論。有些工作是幾乎無所謂效率的。它永久在那裏進行。並沒有什麽好，它即使停頓一輩子，也沒有什麽不好。試舉一例，［等因奉此］的所謂［辦公］便是。</p>
<p>近來讀王印川所著的［蘇聨五年計畫奮鬭成功史］。書中記着一個中年婦人對著者說的話：［從前我們的生活雖然舒服，可是僅止我們的少數，那多數的人比我們的現在還不如的多多，現在我們的少數雖然不如從前。可是多數人比從前好了，這也是公道應該這樣的。·····</p>
<p>又况政府人員他們把我們的節省物料都賣到外國、換來現金，買成機器，建築這些許多的工場鐵路房屋等等。我們是親眼看得見的。我們現在的生活雖是不大美滿，雖是拮据，可是我們是有希望的不大美滿，有富裕的拮据，並且全國通同一樣的不美滿與拮据。］</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>說這一段話的時候，那個婦人也露着愁顏吧。試想，和她的愁顏同時並存的是怎樣的力和心？五年計畫四年完成了，這是效率的總表現。在這樣鉅大的工作中，當然誰也偷懶不得。　　如果愁顏而外，别無其他。還不如追歡尋笑的好。這究竟有益於衛生。反正進行與停頓猶如二五與一十，停頓一下又有什麽要緊。所以通令全國新年停止辦公三天的辦法是値得我們贊許的</p>

<h3 id="c160">［年年除夕沒有月亮］ <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>離開故鄉已經五年了，關於故鄉慶祝元旦的作揖，叩頭，說吉利話，等等的習俗，早已在記憶裏日益　糊，只有［年年除夕沒有月亮］一句俗話，却至今還在腦子裏深深地刻着，愈想愈學得其［很有意思。］</p>
<p>本來，除夕沒有月亮，確是一椿煞風景的事。假如［除夕］而又［有月亮］則當人們［闔家歡聚斗酒自勞］之際，仰望天空皓月，大家浴在銀色的［光明］裏，旣無須放砲仗炸破死寂，也無須舉火把照破黑暗，這當更可以令人們在［喜］氣上更增些［樂］氣！然而在我的經騐裏，過去的二十七次除夕畢竟每次都是沒有月亮，每次都是一個黑暗的死夜。</p>
<p>大概是因爲大家不甘心除夕沒有月亮之故，於是在不久以前，便浩浩蕩蕩地來過一次［革命］，這次革命，把［舊歷］革到用［新曆］，把除夕從［晦］字的命運下拖將出來。革命於是乎［成了功］，大家欣欣然有喜色，满以爲從此除夕會有月亮，即或沒有光明的月，至少也應該不是［黑漆一團。］但希望終於欺騙了我們，今年的除夕還是和往年一樣的［黑］，而且黑暗裏還夾着雨絲，冷得令人打戰！</p>
<p>不記得是那一位英國人或是美國人曾經說過這樣一句話：［從一九二九年起，我們便不曾有過一個快樂的聖誕節］，但是，天曉得，我們是更不如，從有生以來，我們便不曾有過一個有月亮的除夕呵！</p>
<p>我們來動手把這昏瞶的天改造一下罷，這樣，或者我們才終於能有一個［有月亮的除夕］！</p>
<h3 id="c161">老舍來信說： <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>烈文先生：</p>
<p>您向我要小品文；老實不客氣講，咱不會。請您往這邊來。有句私話：我對大品中品文字都有拿手丨丨底下那句似乎不必說。不信請問馬大嬸去，我是不是大品文字的文豪丨不過，您一定非彆扭我不可，我自有主意。　看，我只須由大品往下一溜，溜成中品：再由中品往下一溜，溜爲小品，其庶幾乎？但是，從中國文學史上看，大品文字眞是麟毛鳳角（出角的鳳是種兩棲動物，據說），在咱們的［國書］中丨這應與國術國恥國學等並列，不是駐英或駐法公使拿着的那紙文書丨還沒見過一部或一篇大品詩或文。您也許相信這個？有此原因，我對小品文到底有些冷淡：您看，我是要給國書中添上幾本大玩藝。我得取法乎上上，以得其上；得跑到無極的上邊</p>
<p>，以便生太極。太極拳是國術，太極文正好是國書。等我的傑作出世的時候，連蕭伯納帶莎士比亞就都得入中國籍，學咱們的國學。因此，我還是不能往下溜；［鯉魚打挺］是我的態度。大品文的大法，您可曉得？上帝造人，您可看過？我曉得，看見過。上帝說，呌世界有光，刷的一下。金光萬道，十五個太陽，帶着幾萬萬萬大小不等，一齊發笑的明星。呌世界有人，拍的一聲，人山人海，人心人肺，人情人理，人命關天。您看，我的大品文的大法至無能也要與這個相似。您呌我寫小品文，設若我少着一分幽默，非急不不可！</p>
<p>假如您以爲這全不對，那麽，您說到底什麽是小品文！祝</p>
<p>吉！弟老舍鞠躬</p>

<p>[P時代与愛的歧路三十二</p>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他倆都在剝瓜子。兩人間沉寂了好一會。海泉此刻忽然思及鶴子夫人了。同時又懷疑卓女士究竟爲什麽事呌自己來這裏呢？他想痛快地問問她，但又客氣地遲疑着。</p>
<p>［我本來討厭這邊的地方。不過沒有辦法，一時找不出適當的房子。你看，這一家房屋住兩三家人喲。］</p>
<p>［住在下面的是怎樣的人家？］</p>
<p>海泉此趟率直的問了。她沒有立即回答，他看見她的頰上略泛出微紅來了。</p>
<p>［我們是向下面分租過來的。搬過來後，才曉得她們是，·····］</p>
<p>她說看雙頰更加泛紅了，同時低下頭去。</p>
<p>［那末，你該早點搬家。］</p>
<p>［我還不是和我媽說過了。不過，····蜜司脫林，你也不是别人，老實對你說吧，太貴的房子我們實在住不起。我有一個哥哥，在××局裏當小職員，每月只是三十多塊錢的薪水。我爹不死時，····］</p>
<p>她像感概無量般地在這樣申訴。</p>
<p>［你有多少兄弟姊妹？］</p>
<p>［一個哥哥，一個姊姊，我是最小的。］</p>
<p>［你的姊姊呢？］</p>
<p>給海泉這樣一問，她又遲疑了一下。過了一忽，她才說，</p>

<p>又坐了一會，一個娘姨才端了一杯半温的褐色茶來給他。海泉坐得有點不好意思了，很想起身告辭。但給卓淑華看出來了。</p>
<p>［讓我去呌我媽媽和哥哥來見你。他們很想認識你。］</p>
<p>她說着走出去了。她好像沒有下樓去。他想，大概是往亭子間裏去了。只一刻工夫，她又笑着走回來了。拖了拖椅子，向他凑近一點坐下來。他聞着了一陣耐人尋味的香氣了。</p>
<p>攬一攬她，聞聞香氣也不錯吧。最多她笑着駡一句討厭，走開去吧了。如果有這個勇氣，不會碰什麽釘子也說不定。］</p>
<p>但他只是想着，他已經滿臉紅熱起來了。同時他恐怕這種下劣的舉動會引起她對自己的鄙視。</p>
<p>［給她鄙視又算得什麽，自己完全沒有這種種勇氣，確是眞的。］</p>
<p>［蜜司脫林，聽說你的姊丈是在財政部裏做大官，是不是？］</p>
<p>［沒有的事。］</p>
<p>他忙否認。但他已經直覺着了，她所問的是那位任碩士了。</p>

<p>Japanese Military Conference Held in Jinzhou</p>
<p>Decided to First Suppress the Volunteer Army on the Edge of Rehe</p>
<p>Purchase Miscellaneous Grains to Create Artificial Famine</p>
<p>Yaowangmiao Two Districts Occupied by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of the Army to Issue Warning Text</p>
<p>(Beiping) Confirmed information: The Japanese army is prepared to launch a large-scale invasion of Rehe at the end of January or the beginning of February. At the same time, a portion of the Japanese army will advance into Yu Guan and Qinhuangdao to contain our rear. Once Rehe is captured, they will invade Pingjin. It is also said that the Japanese army will first take Pingjin. If Pingjin is occupied, Rehe can be obtained without attacking. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the urgency of the situation in Rehe, the embassy district police department is preparing for special martial law when necessary. Our cars will be subject to inspection when passing through the embassy district at that time. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaoyang is currently guarded by local militias and volunteer armies, and its defenses are precarious. Yaowangmiao is a remote place, with no inhabitants for hundreds of miles. Yaowangmiao, belonging to the third and fourth districts, is occupied by the Japanese army. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Captain Ishimoto is still being held by the volunteer army in Chaoyang. The volunteer army demands 300,000 rifles, 20 cannons, and 2 million yuan from the Japanese army for his release. The Japanese army has not agreed. Ishimoto's wife, fearing for his safety, frequently flies to Chaoyang to visit him and provides the volunteer army with funds to ensure he is treated well. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese plan to invade Rehe is divided into three steps: First, to disrupt the morale of the army and people of Rehe by using large sums of money to collude with traitors, purchasing various grains to artificially create famine. More than 2 million yuan has already been spent on buying miscellaneous grains in Kailu, Xinlitun, Fuxin Qinghekou, Lingyuan, and other places. Currently, one dou of Gaoliang (sorghum) in Rehe costs four jiao and five fen in silver dollars, which is equivalent to more than 20 yuan in Rehe currency. Merchants and the people feel extremely distressed. Once the artificial famine is successful, the second step is a pacification policy, using traitors to buy off the volunteer army and the regular army with generous treatment. Fortunately, our army's defenses are tight, and they have not yet succeeded. The third step is to send heavy troops to Lingyuan to take Rehe. The Japanese army will attack Rehe, and 16 mixed brigades composed of traitors will disturb Pingjin, creating an extraordinary situation by using extraordinary means to shift international attention. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army convened a military conference in Jinzhou on the 26th to discuss the issue of invading the Rehe border. Chief of Staff Koiso from the Mutō faction participated in the conference. It was decided to first suppress the volunteer army on the edge of Rehe before invading Rehe. The plan is now being implemented according to the decision. Tan Guoyuan, Secretary-General of the Rehe Provincial Government, came to Ping from Chengde today to report on the situation in Rehe and to discuss matters. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) Japan's strategy for attacking Rehe is as follows: First, command the rebel army and bandits formed into the puppet "National Salvation Army" to invade in multiple directions. After achieving considerable results, the Japanese army will then advance to avoid significant casualties. Currently, six brigades of the puppet "National Salvation Army," totaling more than 6,000 people, are gathered in Jinxi County and Yixian County. Yu Zhishan's rebel army of four regiments have arrived in Dahu Mountain and Heishan, and more are arriving in Zhangwu Xinlitun. After the deployment is complete, they will wait for orders to act. The Japanese army's current deployments in the Dalu area are: more than 200 stationed inside Beizhen County, with fortifications built inside and outside the city and on the city walls; more than 100 in Badao Hao; more than 200 in Xinlitun; about 300 in Zhangwu County; and about 400 each in Dahu Mountain and Tongliao, all with solid fortifications. In Fangshan Town, Guojia Dian, Fengjia Wopu, Yihuta Yamenying, and other places, there are 20-30 or 40-50 soldiers stationed, all with simple fortifications. In addition, more than 300 Japanese soldiers are currently stationed in Suizhong County, east of Yu Guan, with six cannons. There are no Japanese soldiers in Jinxi County. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang told people that if Rehe is not defended, Pingjin and North China will be in danger. The people of Rehe are impoverished and financially strained, making it difficult to resist the violent bandits. But people have faces, and trees have bark. I am determined to risk my old life and fight to the death. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Qinglan purchased miscellaneous grains in Rehe and Heilongjiang with a huge sum of 100,000 yuan to provide relief to the people of Rehe in order to resist the Japanese side's artificial famine policy. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has been sending planes to Chengde, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, and Beipiao to conduct reconnaissance, taking pictures and films from low altitudes. If our army and people fire shots, they will drop bombs and bombard us. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Suizhong said that since the last Japanese army attack on Zheng Guilin's volunteer army failed and suffered heavy losses, the Japanese side has increased troop deployments and concentrated them along the Jinzhou and puppet Fengshan Railway line, preparing for mobilization in the near future. Transportation is extremely busy, but there have been no actions to attack the volunteer army. Zheng Guilin, commander of the Fifth Route Army, personally went to the front lines from somewhere yesterday morning to supervise the troops. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the summer of this year, the village committees on the border between Rehe and Lingnan have occasionally launched riots due to resisting taxes and beating local officials, all of which have been suppressed and calmed down by the local garrison. Recently, they have secretly expanded their organization and are ready to move, and the situation is critical. Tang Yulin, with limited forces, fears that he will not be able to suppress them and telegraphed Ping the other day to request the dispatch of troops for assistance. Zhang sent a certain brigade to suppress them. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army has decided to first eliminate the volunteer army in western Liaoning before attacking Rehe.

<p>Declares China Has Never Had an Anti-Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Japan Has No Right to Station Troops in Shanghai and Manchuria</p>
<p>(Geneva) Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, submitted another opinion on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The full text is very long. First, it describes Japan's deliberate attempt to provoke disturbances in Manchuria and other parts of China. The opinion refutes Japan's claim that former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting allowed the prohibition of the dissemination of the Tanaka Memorial, and that China requested the temporary stationing of Japanese troops in Jinan in 1927. Representative Gu also said that China has never had an anti-foreign policy, and the good treatment of foreign personnel serving in Chinese agencies is a clear proof. Then he mentioned the case of Japan attacking Shanghai, saying that the countries had agreed to assemble protective troops to be distributed within the Shanghai International Settlement. This agreement was never notified to China. Since China did not know the situation, it could not be bound by it. As for the section of the public concession under the jurisdiction of the Japanese army, including a part of the land completely managed by China, China cannot recognize the binding force of the above agreement. And no matter what the agreement is, it cannot allow Japan to invade Chinese land outside the concession, let alone allow Japan to attack Chinese troops stationed near the concession. Another part of the opinion explained the war in Korea. Although Japan cited the Sino-Russian Treaty of 1896 as an excuse, Japan should ultimately bear the responsibility. The opinion also recalled that the United States suggested returning the sovereignty of Manchuria to China, saying that the US policy has not changed so far. As for Japan's stationing of troops in Manchuria or Shanghai, no treaty can be used as a basis. Japan's attack on Jinzhou, the reasons it cited were completely false. The opinion pointed out Japan's interception of Manchurian salt and customs duties, and also proved that Japan's terrorist acts in Manchuria were increasing, and public opinion there was suppressed by Japan and could not express free opinions. Matsuoka Yosuke's opinion on the future of China was based on his own wishes as facts. Representative Gu said that Japan showed contempt for international obligations, distrust of the League of Nations, and wanted to make people believe that there was danger on the Soviet side. Representative Gu said that China has made significant progress in suppressing the Communist Party. Japan's policy is arrogant and uses intimidation as a means. In short, the principles of the League of Nations should not be allowed to waver, and the interests related to world peace should be placed above all other interests. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>

If they are still stationed there, it will be difficult for the Allied forces to agree. ㈡ The defense areas occupied by the Allied forces this time are all rich areas, and the amount occupied by each unit is uneven. There must be those who advocate breaking the defense zone system in order to seek fairness. ㈢ Even if the defense zone system is broken, the full power will be concentrated in the provincial government, and who should succeed the provincial chairman is also a matter of discussion. Therefore, the future of the conference is still not optimistic. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Northeast Problem and the World Powers: Light <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Before the World War, the issues were in Europe, in the Atlantic Ocean; international disputes were in Europe, while the colonial market scramble in Asia and Africa was at the forefront of these issues, the object of contention, but the core was still in Europe, and the competition was mainly between major powers such as England, Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungary. The struggle for maritime rights was in the Atlantic Ocean, and the Western Hemisphere (North and South America) was Europe's treasure trove. By the time of the Great War, Europe's development had naturally reached its peak, that is, the development of the eastern shore of the Atlantic had reached its zenith. During the European War, the United States rose sharply, leveraging all its inherent abilities, and suddenly seized the reins of global finance.</p>
<p>However, since the Great War, the international situation has undergone tremendous changes, with the Pacific Ocean becoming the great stage for global competition: the antagonism between Japan and the United States, the disharmony between Britain and the United States, France's desire to open up territories in the Far East, coupled with the rise of Chinese nationalism, and the development of the Soviet Union, not a single event is without mutual conflict. Especially after the Mukden Incident, it has aroused serious attention from all countries in the world, coinciding with a period of deepening economic panic; Japan wants to use external expansion to overcome its domestic difficulties, arousing the primitive aggressive psychology of its people; at the same time, it also knows that in late 1931 and early 1932, Britain and the United States were focusing all their energy on economic recovery, so no matter what violent means are used to deal with China, the powers would not use real strength to intervene. It has a considerable understanding of China's strength, and it knows that China is also struggling in extreme difficulties and will never be able to muster all its strength to deal with it. Therefore, it occupies Liaoning and Jilin to test the waters, and then further attacks Jinzhou. Britain has always been very cautious, especially thorough in its consideration of Far Eastern issues, initially believing that Japan would never dare to swallow the Northeast, as long as its economic interests were not harmed, then it would naturally stand idly by. The United States did not initially believe that the September 18th Incident would continue to escalate, until the Japanese army invaded Jinzhou before issuing a warning to Japan on December 24, 1931, but it still could not prevent the expansion of the incident in the slightest. The January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred and even affected the international market. The United States, without a special base in the Chinese market, naturally felt threatened; even Britain was worried about the erosion of the market along the Yangtze River: so on January 30, Britain and the United States jointly protested to Japan, but focused on the safety of British and American lives and property, and the normal state of the concessions, without mentioning how to eliminate the war of aggression or stop the war. At that time, the United States was the most vehemently angry, but it only stopped at anger. After the Shanghai war, even the degree of anger decreased, the reasons being: first, the deepening of the economic panic in the United States, second, the European countries not only were not in harmony with the United States but even had quite conflicting implications, and third, the existing military strength of the United States could not go to war with Japan, and the United States did not have the necessity or determination to go to war with Japan; so although it was very angry, it could no longer have further expressions. The Soviet Union and Northern Manchuria originally had a relationship of interdependence. If Japanese imperialism succeeded in Northern Manchuria, the area along the Chinese Eastern Railway would certainly not be controlled by the Soviet Union, and Siberia would also feel serious pressure; but on the one hand, it had to be wary of the united opposition of the capitalist countries, and moreover, it was striving to complete the Five-Year Plan, so as long as the Japanese army did not cross the Soviet border and invade Siberia! Then the Soviet Union would always adopt an extremely calm and bystander attitude, watching how rampant Japan was, watching how the conflict changed, watching how Britain and Japan joined hands, and then deciding its foreign policy. In fact, the Soviet Union's prudence, thoroughness, alertness, and tenacity in diplomatic strategy are not behind any country in the current world.</p>
<p>During the period when the sound of cannons shook the sky in Shanghai, the Disarmament Conference opened in Geneva on February 2nd, with a total of fifty-five countries participating, and more than a thousand participants, truly an unprecedented grand event. The purpose was, needless to say, to reduce armaments, but based on the situation on the day the conference opened, simply judging by the facts of the aggression in Shanghai and the continued bloodshed in the Northeast, it was enough to expose the huge contradictions of this conference. Fundamentally, it was already a story of putting on a facade. First, France's security guarantees and Germany's demand for equal armaments were opposed to each other; second, there was the struggle for hegemony between Japan and the United States in the Pacific, especially Japan was expanding its submarines, and the United States insisted on [Open Door, Equal Opportunity], which in reality required a strong naval force as a backing, and Britain was also not at ease with this situation, and the construction of the port of Singapore had not slackened; third, the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, it was rumored that it paid special attention to heavy industry to develop military industries, how could European countries and even Japan be at ease with this. Moreover, the major countries were all striving to replenish their armaments: airplanes, tanks, long-range artillery, pocket warships, etc., were all very sharp weapons. In addition, Japan in the East exhausted its efforts in military affairs, everywhere demonstrating its iron fist of military adventure, although not directly challenging, at least using an iron hand to crush peace, and using machine guns to block the road to peace. Therefore, although the Disarmament Conference had great momentum, it was ultimately hindered by the above-mentioned mountain of contradictions, and even treaties like the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Agreement could not be established.</p>
<p>Although it is not easy for the European and American powers to find compromise solutions in military affairs, it is also not easy to achieve temporary relaxation and reduce the burden of military spending; if they can find new reconciliation schemes in the economy, it may not be a better method than this. Originally, they were prepared at the League of Nations Administrative Council on December 10th to seek an economic outlet in the East. The League of Nations Investigation Team came to the East, saying it was for the Sino-Japanese conflict, and to investigate the truth of the Manchurian Incident with a fair attitude. However, when the League of Nations Investigation Team came to the East, it spent twelve days in Japan, and when it first landed in China in Shanghai, it spent another twenty-five days in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Yichang, Wanhsien, and other places, then ten days in Beiping, and only on April 20th did it go to the Northeast to spend forty-four days investigating. After June 5th was the time for editing the report. The contents of the Investigation Team's report (there were criticisms everywhere in the world, and this newspaper also made fair criticisms, which will not be repeated). We only need to know that the team first circled in the Yangtze River basin and Beiping to know its true meaning. Therefore, the conclusion of the Investigation Team's report was to place [Manchuria] under the guidance of the International Advisory Conference. It is obvious that it is to achieve international coordination, especially the world's major powers (the United States' secret help is especially powerful) to have Japan implement the [Open Door] and [Equal Opportunity] declarations, and to let Japan cede some of the rights it has seized in [Manchuria] to various countries, so that the surplus goods can find a new market and there is hope for a turnaround in the economic panic. However, the [Open Door] advocated by Japan was originally a means to ease the active intervention of the powers; when the diplomatic situation eased, it would take back the words of [Open Door] and advocate [East Asian Monroe Doctrine]. Therefore, the investigation of the Investigation Team only stopped at investigation, and no other significance or role could be found.</p>
<p>Therefore, the opposition between Japan and the United States became more and more clear, the relationship between Britain and the United States was not satisfactory, and Europe was also brewing a crisis. Especially the cancer that the world has recognized for ten years, the German reparations, since the US President initiated the postponement of reparations payments in June 1931, in the past year, the world economy has not only not improved, but even has little hope of improving: Germany has become even more severe, and in terms of unemployed workers, it has increased from 4 million in June of the previous year to 5.5 million in June of this year. Therefore, the reparations conference was held in Lausanne on June 16th. After several discussions, although the reparations were not completely waived, the world's cancer has been cut open; in name, the reparations were renamed the European Reconstruction Fund, the amount was reduced by 29/30ths, and it would still need to be compensated after the market recovered three years later. Item 5 of the Lausanne Conference Resolution also included a clause calling for a world economic conference to be convened by the League of Nations, and solutions to currency issues, tariff issues, and war debts should be found in the world economic conference. Although it was attached with a proviso that if war debts were not reduced, the Lausanne Treaty would have to be reconsidered; but this was clearly a means to deal with the United States, and would not have much impact on the Lausanne Treaty in reality. During the Lausanne Conference era, even though there were various discordant situations, the European countries were generally united, Britain and France naturally followed suit, and Germany also understood the relationship of international politics and made relative concessions; looking at the scene at that moment, capitalism truly had a symbol of revival. From the establishment of the Lausanne Treaty (June 29th) to the British Imperial Economic Conference (July 21st), the time was only one month, and the spirit of coordination was almost completely dispersed. Indeed, what was discussed in Ottawa was within the British Empire: the political and economic issues between Britain and its self-governing dominions and colonies: but Britain abandoned its traditional economic policy 丨丨 Free Trade and adopted protectionist trade, and there was an even more special phenomenon, which was the economic alliance of the British Empire. The impact of this alliance, not to mention in Britain itself, gave great stimulus to countries around the world: Japan in the East wanted to annex the three northeastern provinces to form a [Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance]: the United States would certainly further strengthen the American [Monroe Doctrine]; France, although unable to revive the European economic alliance for a time, was even more obsessed with self-sufficiency and closed-doorism; the Soviet Union was originally a separate system, and the fifteen years of struggle</p>

<p>the more it intensifies its efforts to build a socialist country on its own. Moreover, the national capital of the colonies has gradually risen, the revolutionary movements in South American countries, the awakening of India, and the subtle growth of Chinese nationalism are all dramatic phenomena of the complex opposition between countries in the current world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the so-called union of capitalist countries against Russia has ultimately become propaganda more than anything else. Of course, we admit that the capitalist countries do have malice towards the Soviet Union, and they really do not want the existence of the Soviet Union, but they are still paying attention to the development of this promising market in the Soviet Union, so except for the United States, several major countries have normal diplomatic relations and business dealings with it, even if the United States does not have commercial relations, then the so-called anti-Russianism is actually much milder compared to the mutual opposition of capitalist countries (such as the opposition between Germany and France, the opposition between France and Italy, and the opposition between the United States and Japan). The Japanese-Soviet fisheries agreement in mid-August, followed by the Japanese-Soviet oil agreement, and then the Japanese-Soviet understanding during Matsuoka Yosuke's activity in Moscow. Especially important are the [Non-Aggression Treaty] between France and the Soviet Union, followed by the non-aggression treaty between Poland and the Soviet Union; on the one hand, this does not seem to have any major meaning, but on the other hand, it breaks the fifteen-year gap between France and the Soviet Union. France will shift from preventing Russia to developing closer commercial relations with the Soviet Union, and so will Poland; as for the Soviet Union! Then the western front will be calm from now on. All in all, the capitalist countries' vigilance against the Soviet Union cannot be without (even if there is, it is similar to the mutual vigilance of capitalist countries, and is not worth mentioning), and the anti-Russian movement has at least been eased.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, Britain and France were originally consistent, but they went their separate ways in order to repay the war debts due, and a huge storm broke out between France and the United States over the war debts. Even the US Senate and House of Representatives proposed retaliatory measures against France. This economic dispute caused a rift in Franco-American relations, which had a negative impact on the recovery of the market. Since Britain and France took different steps, and Franco-American relations deteriorated, and disputes occurred between Italy and Yugoslavia, in other words, the opposition between France and Italy worsened. These situations, even if they do not lead to serious consequences, will at least affect the world economy and make it more difficult to recover. And the increase in unemployed workers, the shrinking of the market, the economic alliance of closed-doorism 丨丨 the prevalence of self-sufficiency, is the first characteristic of the international situation in 1932, and the struggle to compete for the market, to advocate equal benefit sharing, and to monopolize is the second.

<h3 id="e19">The Northeast Incident over the Past Year: Du Liang <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Time flies like an arrow. The past scene will never return. The humiliating and disgraceful Republic of China's 21st year has ended its ominous years. The sunshine that is dawning in the 22nd year is just brewing its future vitality. At this time of the New Year, we also want to express our inner expectations. What kind of thoughts and feelings can be used as a warning? Tracing back to the launch of the September 18th Incident, the soil of the three provinces was completely destroyed in an instant. The vastness of the lost territory and the speed of the loss are truly unheard of in this era, and rarely seen in history. All those who belong to the human race must have the thought of wiping out the shame and seeking survival. At the end of the 20th year, how could we not expect the strength of the 21st year to restore the lost territory and restore the rivers and mountains to their former glory. After hesitating for a year, what did the facts reward us? The vast land of the Northeast has been nibbled away, and the essence of Shanghai has been destroyed again. The government authorities only have the call for resistance, and the League of Nations only engages in empty talk on paper, watching the Japanese warlords act arbitrarily and recklessly, waving their hands freely, and have not been able to restrain them in the slightest. At this point, the people of the country should be disgusted with the unreliability of other forces, and urgently seek to save themselves. However, at the mention of self-salvation, there are some negative phenomena that disappoint and discourage us. The brave soldiers outside the Pass are fighting bloody battles against the powerful enemy, while the soldiers inside the Pass are fighting to seize territory. After the catastrophe, the disaster-stricken are shivering in the cold and desolate wind, while the playboy princes are frolicking in the arena of singing and dancing. Comparing the two scenes, the insightful people are truly overwhelmed with the fear of perishing together. However, today, can we still use the way of mutual blame and accusations to shirk our responsibilities? Hundreds of millions of people should unite and work together to fulfill their promises. Starting from the New Year's Day of the 22nd year, we must cleanse our hearts and minds, and temper ourselves. Starting from the New Year's Day of the 22nd year, we must unite as one to resist foreign aggression. To only curse the past is not enough to cover up the past sins. To have empty hopes for the future may not necessarily lead to a way out. Learning from the past failures and encouraging the future, it is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep. I will take advantage of the spare time of this newspaper's New Year's Day special edition to summarize the main points of the Northeast situation over the past year, as a call to action and to show that we have not forgotten.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, Liaoning established a temporary provincial government in Jinzhou. The Japanese side saw this as an obstacle and wanted to get rid of it. Ever since the Inukai Cabinet was formed and Araki Sadao succeeded as the Minister of the Army, their aggression against us has become more active. The British, American, and French envoys to Japan successively sent政牒 to the Japanese government, advising it to avoid the conflict in Jinzhou. The Japanese government replied that it had no intention of attacking Jinzhou, but secretly made every effort to arrange military operations against Jinzhou. In late December of the 20th year, a large number of Japanese planes bombed the vicinity of Jinzhou and successively captured Panshan Goubangzi. By January 2nd of the 21st year, Jinzhou was lost. The Japanese army then advanced and occupied Lianshan Suizhong, using the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line to invade Rehe, but was blocked by the volunteer army and failed. In order to divert the attention of the Chinese people, the Japanese increased troops in the Eastern Provinces on the one hand, and actively provoked in Shanghai on the other, which led to the January 28th Incident. (For details of the Shanghai War, see another article, which will not be repeated here.) By early February, Harbin was also captured. At this point, the Japanese wanted to implement a puppet policy, using traitors such as Zang Shiyi, Xi Qia, and Zhang Jinghui to support Puyi in organizing the so-called Manchurian State and establishing a false capital in Changchun. Puyi assumed the false post of ruler on March 9th and issued a declaration. The Japanese also incited them to forcibly take over the customs and intercept the salt tax. Ma Zhanshan was known for his anti-Japanese achievements. At the beginning of the organization's establishment, he once feigned compliance and accepted a false post. In early April, he secretly went to Heihe, telegraphed to resist Japan, and announced the evidence that the false country was established by Japanese conspiracy. At that time, volunteer armies rose up everywhere. Leaders such as Ding Chao, Li Du, Feng Zhanhai, and Wang Delin all contacted Ma and others, calling themselves the National Salvation Army or the Self-Defense Army, and acted separately to resist Japan. Suddenly, Shenyang was in danger, and suddenly, Harbin was besieged. Famous cities and towns were repeatedly recovered. The volunteer army was powerful and the Japanese were exhausted. In late July, the false country forcibly took over the Northeast post offices. At the same time, the Japanese army once again advanced towards Rehe, using the Ishimoto case as an excuse to send planes to bomb the villages and towns on the Rehe border. The great powers were also very wary of the Japanese's arrogance. US Secretary of State Stimson repeatedly stated that he would not recognize the status of the Northeast created by force. Japan ignored this and went its own way, and its antipathy towards the United States became even greater. In early August, the Japanese appointed Muto Nobuyoshi as the commander of the Kwantung Army, and Honjo Shigeru was transferred back to Japan. At the same time, Muto was also appointed as the special envoy to Manchuria and notified the League of Nations to prepare for the recognition of the false country. As for September 15th, it disregarded everything and formally recognized the false Manchurian State. The two sides signed the Japan-Manchuria Protocol. The false country also announced the independence of the customs. Until September, Su Bingwen's road protection team stationed in the Chinese Eastern Railway revolted and occupied Manchuria Station, which boosted the anti-Japanese situation. Su and Ma communicated with each other and advanced on Qiqihar. The Japanese army suffered repeated setbacks. The Japanese military headquarters instructed the troops stationed in Shenyang to use both bribery and force against the volunteer army. At the same time, it continued to arm and immigrate to the three eastern provinces to increase its strength. On the one hand, it repeatedly induced Su Bingwen to negotiate peace. Su sternly refused and persisted for many days. In the end, due to the lack of ammunition and food, he was forced to retreat into Russian territory. At this point, the Japanese army claimed that there was no need to worry about Northern Manchuria and wanted to advance into Rehe with all its heart. At the time of writing, the situation on the border was extremely tense. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. They harbor the ambition of a giant pig and a long snake and have the ambition of swallowing and eating. If they are not stopped in the阴, there will be no end. How can the people of the country still not rise up and pursue the final resistance? Under the overturned nest, there are no intact eggs.</p>

<h3 id="e20">New Year's Greetings from Guangzhou <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>With great difficulty, and yet, very luckily, the year 1932 slipped past the edge of terror and destruction last night. This morning, every politician, financier, and entrepreneur in capitalist countries seems to be able to congratulate each other with tearful smiles, [Oh, thank God, we have struggled through another year.]</p>
<p>However, the past year of 1932 did not rid the world of the misfortune of panic. The newly arrived 1933 is not necessarily a [symbol of the world's turning point]. History has already arranged a [destination] for this world. At present, the world is like struggling laboriously in a bottomless dark cave. Only by struggling to the end of the darkness can one hope to see the dawn. That is to say, although 1932 luckily slipped away last night, we have not yet reached a year in which we can [turn tears into smiles].</p>
<p>Let us try to take the facts left in front of us by the past year of 1932 and make a rough review: First, from an economic point of view, 1932 was the fourth year after the outbreak of the world economic panic. Of course, no matter from which aspect we observe it, it was only the deepening of the panic and the intensified development of the crisis. Just in terms of the unemployed masses around the world, according to statistics published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, among the 311 million people in Europe, the number of unemployed was 11,378,000, and among the 123 million people in the United States, the number of unemployed was 11,400,000. According to the annual report of Thomas, Director of the International Labor Office, in the world unemployment crisis, one out of every 28 people is deprived of their means of survival. From this huge number of unemployed, we can clearly see the depth of the world economic panic.</p>
<p>Moreover, these figures are still the result of the [manufacturing] of clever politicians. They are discounted remnants, not the real numbers. We only see that whether it is the United States, the richest place in the world, or the United Kingdom, a capitalist developed country, or Switzerland, known for its peace, there is a miserable cry of hunger and cold everywhere, and there is a roar of [demanding work, demanding bread] everywhere. London has been threatened twice by 2,500 hungry pedestrians, Washington has been surrounded by veterans of the European War and hunger marchers, and even the [City of Peace, Geneva], where the world's politicians and diplomats gather to discuss [peace], has experienced bloodshed. Cries of complaint, roars of anger, and spontaneous [struggles for survival] have become widespread in the capitalist world. What does this brand-new fact illustrate? Doesn't it further show the deep-seated disease of capitalism? Doesn't it say that the economic panic has set off a terrifying black tide of turmoil in the capitalist world?</p>
<p>However, don't be really deceived by the above facts, thinking that the world is really [poor]. Let me tell you, the world is not poor, and it is feeling quite excessive! Despite the fact that tens of millions of people are crying out in hunger and cold on the one hand, on the other hand, some people are pouring a large amount of milk into rivers and burning a large amount of rice and wheat. Capital is sleeping in warehouses, and goods are piled up in warehouses. They and the hungry and cold masses are increasing their numbers in direct proportion. The hungry and cold masses are crying out [no way out], and they are also crying out [no way out]. Who says the world is poor? But looking at it from another perspective, who can say that the world is not poor? In fact, haven't the majority of the population already fallen into the tragic situation of hunger and cold?</p>
<p>The world is playing the magic of [farce] and [contradiction] in this way. However, look, isn't the hand of the performer of the magic trembling? Isn't it shivering?</p>
<p>This is a rough outline of the world economy in 1932.</p>
<p>○　　○　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>Putting aside the world, let's take another look at our country.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country, we also feel that everything in front of us is like a tangled thread, and we don't know where to start. From the perspective of foreign troubles, it is very obvious that the situation is getting worse day by day, following the September 18th Incident of the previous year. The Northeast Volunteer Army has gradually shown signs of defeat. Ma Zhanshan's troops have retreated to a corner, Su Bingwen's troops have also retreated into Soviet territory, and Feng Zhanhai's troops are also unable to support themselves. The reason for their failure is the same: [exhausted ammunition and food], [lack of follow-up support]. Rehe is now also reporting an emergency, and North China is also full of rumors and panic. What does this fact illustrate? It clearly points out that taking advantage of the tide of economic panic, Japanese imperialists are actively implementing a gunboat policy against our country, and this aggressive action is actually tacitly approved by the powers. Although by the end of last year, due to the urgency of the diplomatic situation, China and the Soviet Union finally officially resumed diplomatic relations, in fact, the implementation of this diplomatic policy had already missed the opportunity, so it has not yet achieved any success.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of domestic politics, the characteristics of domestic politics in our country in 1932 were, first, the continued outbreak of internal turmoil. First, there was the Guangdong Rebellion, then the Shandong Rebellion, followed by the Sichuan Rebellion, and the Guizhou Rebellion. In the Guangdong Rebellion, the aircraft that did not dare to resist Japan showed their skills, and [Flying Eagle] was such a sacrifice. Also, in the Shandong Rebellion, according to the Inspection Record of Yexian after the Calamity, it said that [broken wells and ruined walls, a piece of rubble, a hundred years of essence, destroyed in one battle], the misery of its poisoning can be imagined. In the Sichuan War, the people suffered even more miserably. In the battles of Jiangjin, Luzhou, Zizhong, and Chengdu, more than 3,000 innocent people died, and commercial losses in the war zone reached more than 70 million, and other direct losses were countless. Taking the week-long street fighting in Chengdu as an example, the prosperous streets were turned into scorched earth, cultural institutions were destroyed, and the number of student deaths exceeded 1,000. Although there are currently no statistics available for the losses of the Guizhou Rebellion, judging from the poisoning of the Guangdong Rebellion, the Shandong Rebellion, and the Sichuan Rebellion, it is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from an economic point of view: the annual trade deficit has long become an ironclad fact, but this year it will be even more. According to statistics from the International Trade Bureau, this year's trade deficit is at least more than 620 million Customs Taels. Furthermore, social economy is even more [unbearable!]. The floods the year before last destroyed the rural areas completely, and last year's bumper harvest not only failed to support the people's deaths, but also accelerated the destruction of the rural areas. Under the combination of various reasons, the rural areas accelerated bankruptcy, and the decline of major agricultural products such as silk and mulberry was beyond words. There is an extremely obvious fact: Jiangsu has always been known as a rich area in our country, but according to a survey, there are a total of 345 pawnshops in 43 counties in the province, with a total capital of more than 13.6 million, but it is still not enough to cope with the poverty of the rural areas, which can be imagined. If Jiangsu Province is like this, what about other provinces?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the political and economic situation in China in 1932 does show a kind of disease. However, we believe that to diagnose and treat a disease, we must first know where the root cause of the disease lies. If you are sick, you know it yourself. This is unnecessary. At this time, it is the critical moment for the life and death of the Chinese nation. The catastrophe of the future world and the end of the Chinese nation can only be overcome by facing forward and breaking through this black wave. Now we put forward a few points as our New Year's greetings for 1933.</p>
<p>First, only a government and people with a plan that can be implemented diligently can jump out of this economically panicky world and move towards a prosperous future. The success of the Soviet Union's first five-year plan and the start of the second five-year plan today are a model.</p>
<p>Second, under a strict plan, the masses can do their best and do their best, and everyone is doing their best and doing their best for the society, so that they can achieve great results. Not being able to integrate with the masses and not being able to use the great power of the masses is exactly the way to self-destruction.</p>
<p>Third, leaders must strive to have the spirit of sacrificing for the people, and use their great personality to develop their bright attitude and bear the heavy responsibility of this politics. The people must also strive for self-reliance in order to obtain freedom, and must never hope for the gifts of others.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Tang Zhongming invented a charcoal-fueled automobile, and the test was successful. Now Tang has come to Beijing from Taiyuan, on the one hand submitting an application for registration to the Ministry of Industry, and on the other hand contacting various parties to discuss the method of establishing a factory for manufacturing. Chen Lifu and others greatly appreciate Tang's invention, and they all believe that Tang has opened a new era in China's scientific community, and that it is of great benefit to national defense. China spends a huge amount of money every year on purchasing gasoline, and once there is a foreign affair, the import of gasoline will be cut off, and transportation will be in great danger. After the invention of charcoal-fueled automobiles, it can both recover rights and eliminate the above-mentioned concerns. It is heard that in order to make it convenient for people in the capital to understand the manufacturing and performance of charcoal-fueled automobiles, Tang plans to transport the automobile to Beijing for testing after New Year's Day.

<p>National News Agency Berlin, 30th--Recently, the French side has been clamoring that when the former Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Jiang Zuobin, was in office, he was ordered by the National Government to purchase a large amount of arms from German factories. This statement has now been declared by the authorities here to be completely contrary to the facts. Since the end of the European War, only small arms, such as pistols, could be transported abroad from the weapons manufactured in Germany. In recent years, German arms have still been shipped to China from time to time. The reason is that these weapons were mostly from before the European War, and were a large number of guns and cannons seized by the great powers from Germany during the European War and after the signing of the peace treaty, or entered neighboring countries indirectly through various channels, and then arms dealers transported them to China for sale, but they were no longer the property of Germany. As for the orders for the purchase of arms by the commercial counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Berlin, they were not handed over to German factories, but were purchased from other parties, such as a certain Swedish arms factory, which sold 120 anti-aircraft guns in the past two years, and had previously sold hundreds of machine guns, which is one example. Furthermore, France has no reason to protest against German merchants selling arms, because several of France's largest arms factories are managed by German merchants in China, and their business has been quite developed for several years. French factories have been very satisfied with using German merchants to promote their sales, and have supplied the Chinese army with 1,400 machine guns in the past year and a half. These facts are extremely clear in Nanjing and other places, so it is futile for France to reverse the facts in an attempt to deceive the world.</p>

<p>Barcelona, 30th (Reuters) - The discovery of this plot was purely accidental, which is fortunate, as it saved the entire city from a disaster. A sudden explosion in a house alerted the security forces, who rushed to investigate. They found two well-dressed men standing at the door, who claimed they had been making toy firecrackers in the room and an accidental explosion occurred. The security forces then saw a man heavily bandaged, appearing to be seriously injured, which aroused their suspicion. A search revealed that the house was actually an armaments factory. The men at the door seized the opportunity to escape by car, but the car tire exploded, causing them to stop. The security forces rushed forward and arrested them.</p>

<p>Ending Anti-British Movement as a Condition</p>
<p>London, 30th (Havas) - The government has not taken any action regarding Gandhi's release. If Gandhi were to promise to end the civil disobedience movement he initiated (i.e., the so-called non-violent resistance movement), his release would not be difficult. The civil disobedience movement was caused by the Indian government's promulgation of various orders that aroused public sentiment. Now that the Legislative Council has passed various laws to replace these orders, Gandhi may be able to end the civil disobedience movement. However, one problem remains: although the Indian National Congress is an illegal organization, it has a great deal of influence. Even if Gandhi persuades the National Congress to stop this movement, it is questionable whether the Congress will listen.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Soviet Foreign Trade: A Dispatch from Vladivostok <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Soviet foreign trade is also exclusively operated by the state, so the import and export of goods are highly planned. Since the spring of 1918, about fifteen years ago, its foreign trade development has been quite impressive. Before 1920, the capitalist countries first intervened with military force to destroy the revolutionary government and then imposed a strict blockade policy, so the Soviet Union was completely isolated from the outside world and had no trade to speak of. In the middle of 1920, after the blockade was lifted, the total volume of Soviet foreign trade was only 20 million rubles. During the period from 1920 to 1922, Soviet imports were limited to food and daily necessities, as this was a period of great famine. After 1923, domestic production gradually got back on track, and raw materials and semi-manufactured goods began to be imported, while the quantity of consumer goods decreased significantly. In the year 1924 to 1925, the total trade volume was 1.282 billion rubles, of which exports accounted for 559 million and imports accounted for 723 million rubles. During the three years from 1926 to 1929, in addition to raw materials, the import of machinery became a major item, and consumer goods were reduced to less than 10 percent. The total trade volume in 1928-29 was 1.714 billion rubles, of which exports accounted for 878 million and imports accounted for 836 million rubles. Since the end of 1929, the world economic panic occurred, and the international market showed a state of depression. The total trade volume of various countries has decreased, even reduced to one-third. In this situation, the Soviet Union alone was able to avoid this difficulty, so the capitalist countries are jealous of it, saying that it uses a "penetration" policy to undermine the world economy. In 1930, the total trade volume of the Soviet Union was 2.095 billion rubles, with imports accounting for 1.0688 billion and exports accounting for 1.0364 billion rubles. The total trade volume in 1931 also decreased slightly, totaling 1.9162 billion rubles, of which 811.12 million was exports and 1.105 billion was imports. In the first nine months of this year</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>the total trade volume was 963.8 million, with exports at 410.9 million and imports at 552.9 million.</p>
<p>From January to August this year, Soviet exports can be divided into three categories: The first category is agricultural products, with exports of more than 1.3 million tons, valued at more than 76.45 million rubles. The second category is raw materials and semi-manufactured products, with exports of 9.97 million tons, valued at more than 218 million rubles. The third category is manufactured goods, with exports of 67,000 tons, valued at more than 64.35 million rubles. Therefore, in terms of percentage, the first category accounts for 21.3% of total exports, the second category accounts for 60.8%, and the third category accounts for 17.9% of total exports.</p>
<p>Soviet imports can be divided into four categories as follows: The first category is necessities of life, totaling 377,000 tons, worth 43.63 million rubles. The second category is raw materials and semi-manufactured products, totaling 825,000 tons, worth more than 131.83 million rubles. The third category is manufactured goods, totaling 378,000 tons, worth 326 million rubles. The fourth category is livestock, totaling 31,000 tons, worth 5.627 million rubles. In terms of percentage, the first category accounts for 8.6% of the total, the second category accounts for 25.9%, the third category accounts for 64.4%, and the fourth category accounts for 1.1%.</p>
<p>By country, Germany ranked first in foreign trade this year, with a total volume of more than 308 million rubles, of which exports from the Soviet Union to Germany amounted to more than 66.32 million rubles, and imports from Germany amounted to more than 233.75 million rubles. The second largest was Britain and its colonies, with a total trade volume of more than 167.52 million rubles, of which exports accounted for more than 87.89 million rubles and imports accounted for 79.63 million rubles. The third largest was Italy, with a trade volume of more than 36.96 million rubles.</p>
<p>The fourth was the United States, with a trade volume of 31.035 million rubles. The fifth was France, with a total volume of 21.315 million rubles. The sixth was Japan, with a trade volume of 8.537 million rubles. These are all approximate figures as of the end of August.</p>
<p>In summary, the above-mentioned development roughly shows the achievements of the Soviet Union's economic construction over the past ten years. Compared with the decline of our old nation, it is indeed incomparable. (December 12)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Recent Japanese Military Industry <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Japan, under the hypnosis of militarism, has been completely plunged into war frenzy. The Satsuma and Choshu cliques are preparing for war almost every day. Since the Manchurian Incident, Japan's military industry has become very active. Factories manufacturing military supplies are working day and night without rest. Some sectors of the business community are thus showing some vitality. From this one aspect alone, one can see what ambitions the Japanese warlords harbor.</p>
<p>Japanese military supply manufacturing factories are divided into two parts: one directly under the Army Department and one directly under the Navy Department. In addition, the steel plant belonging to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry also has close ties with military enterprises. Those belonging to the Army Department include the Army Arsenal Tokyo Factory, Atsuta, Chigusa, Ogura, Pyongyang, and Chungmu Ordnance Factories, Army Arsenal Osaka Factory, Jujo, Itabashi, Oji, Iwahana, Uji, and Powder Factories, Okayama, Tokyo, Chiba, Osaka, Hiroshima, and Ogura Ordnance Branches, Army Aviation Headquarters Technical Department, Supply Department Tokorozawa, Kakamigahara Branch Shimoshizu and Akeno, Tokorozawa Army Flying Schools (manufacturing machinery), Osaka and Ujina Army Food Branches, Army Food Headquarters Sapporo Branch, Senju Woolen Mill, Army Clothing Headquarters, Osaka and Hiroshima Army Clothing Branches, Army Transportation Department (shipbuilding) Technical Headquarters (trial production of weapons), Scientific Research Institute (research on military physics and chemistry), Sanitary Materials Factory (pharmaceutical and medical equipment manufacturing), Communications School, Automobile School, 1st Division Ordnance Department, and other military industries, totaling 38 locations. Those belonging to the Navy Department include Yokosuka, Kure, Hiroshima, Sasebo Naval Factories, Hiratsuka Naval Powder Factory, Maizuru Naval Port Department Works Department, Naval Powder Factory Explosives Department, Ominato Naval Port Department Works Department, Tokuyama Naval Fuel Factory, Tokyo Naval Technical Research Institute, Naval Shipbuilding Headquarters Drafting Workshop, Aviation Headquarters Drafting Workshop (ship, weapon, and aircraft drafting), a total of 12 locations. Those belonging to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry include Yawata Iron Works Headquarters and Tobata and Nishi-Yawata Workshops. Most of these state-run factories are combined with private factories. Since the Japanese army suddenly occupied the three northeastern provinces, the military has been abnormally excited and has been purchasing as much of their products and materials as possible from private factories (especially small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises) under the pretext of "saving the current situation" and "rescuing small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises." On the Army Department side, there are 644 private military supply manufacturing factories that have been directly designated to manufacture military supplies, and 778 indirect subcontractors, totaling 1,422. It is expected that the number of directly designated factories will increase to 1,500 in the next year (1933). The sudden expansion of military industry is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Since Japan is so eager to prepare for war, it is necessary to pay close attention to the position of the three most important industries for military industry, the metal industry, the machinery and equipment industry, and the chemical industry, in its national industry. According to the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry's survey of the number of factories, the number of workers, and the production value of various industries across the country in 1930 (Showa 5), there is the following table:</p>
<p>Number of Factories Ratio Number of Workers Ratio Production Value Ratio</p>
<p>% % %</p>
<p>Textile Industry 20,306 32.6 902,399 52.7 2,173,513 36.5</p>
<p>Metal Industry 4,004 6.4 84,112 5.0 501,289 8.4</p>

<p>Total 62,234 100.0 1,683,563 100.0 5,954,740 100.0</p>
<p>According to the above table, it can be seen that among the total industrial production value of 5.954 billion yuan in Japan, in addition to the textile industry and the food industry, which rank first and second, the three items of metal, machinery and equipment, and chemical industry account for 35.3%, which shows their importance.</p>

<p>Total Chemical Industry 3,329 118,260 901,822</p>
<p>According to the table on the right, in the metal industry, the production value of iron refining and copper refining is the highest. In the machinery and equipment industry, iron shipbuilding is the highest. In the chemical industry, mineral fertilizer, soap, and cosmetics manufacturing have the highest production value. These chemical industries are also the easiest to transform into military manufacturing, and their position should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, due to the increased manufacturing in the military industry, not only has the military industry itself made special progress, but other related industries have also benefited. Workers' wages have generally tended to increase. In the midst of capitalism's imminent decline, the stimulation of militarism has suddenly presented a good scene of reflection. Japanese soldiers are happily thinking that they have succeeded in their plan. The army's military expenditure of 447.8 million yuan and the navy's military expenditure of 372.6 million yuan total more than 820 million yuan, accounting for 36% of the total national treasury expenditure, the largest increase in military expenditure since the Russo-Japanese War. In addition, there is also a reserve fund of 10 million yuan for the Manchurian Incident and the dispatch fee of 20 million Japanese yen for the entire 6th Division of Kumamoto to be transferred to Manchuria for replacement a week ago, which is not included.</p>
<p>Of this huge military expenditure, the Army Department's expenditure for military industry in 1933 will be 100 million yuan, about twice that of this year. The total amount of funds for saving the current situation by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is also 160 million yuan. The inevitably sudden turn for the better in the military industry, according to the Bank of Japan's survey in September this year, the index of workers employed in major industries across the country was 74.8 in September, the highest amount this year, an increase of 1.9 compared with the lowest index of 72.9 in January, and an increase of 0.5 compared with the same month last year. Most of this increase is attributed to the military industry, such as machinery manufacturing, which increased by 9% compared with the same period last year, equipment manufacturing increased by 7.6%, metal product manufacturing increased by 1.3%, and rubber manufacturing increased by 6.9%. The wage index in other areas has also increased similarly. According to the Bank of Japan's survey, machinery manufacturing increased by 8.1% in September this year compared with the same period last year, shipbuilding increased by 2.6%, vehicle manufacturing increased by 1.3%, and equipment manufacturing increased by 2.1%. Among them, only metal product manufacturing showed a slight downward trend, but the degree of decline was also very slight. In general, the wage index of military industry clearly has a special increase in the entire industry. At a glance, it is known that it is determined to compete militarily and is the second Germany in the East. In this situation, living abroad in a hotel, looking west at the motherland, I cannot help but feel sad. I wonder what the countries of the world will do with those who disrupt peace.

<p>Great Success of "Worry-Free Dropsy Pills"</p>
<p>Medical Circles Nationwide Demand the Ointment</p>
<p>Dropsy has been regarded as an incurable disease by the medical community in our country, and Western medicine also has no cure for it, except for opening it up with a knife and needle. However, it will swell up again soon, so it is difficult to cure one out of ten patients. Since the invention of "Worry-Free Dropsy Pills" by Shanghai Zheng Xian Pharmacy (West Heng Street, Wing On Company, Nanjing Road), it has saved many lives for more than ten years. For all patients suffering from water-qi dropsy, abdominal distension, qi deficiency and fullness, women's blood qi stagnation, infantile swelling and food accumulation, etc., after taking these pills, they have all been cured by the medicine. Therefore, the medical community across the country regards it as a groundbreaking miracle drug, and Xian Pharmacy introduces it. The efficacy of this pill is great and rapid. Patients with mild cases can be cured by taking half a dose, and those with severe cases will be cured by one dose. A detailed instruction manual is available, and a two-cent stamp is attached to the letter. The price is 20 yuan per dose, 10 yuan for half a dose, and 5 yuan per box. No additional postage will be charged for out-of-town mail orders, and the original team will reply.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Miracle Drug for Frostbite <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Unbroken Frostbite! Swelling Disappears on the Same Day</p>
<p>Broken Frostbite! Recovery in a Few Days</p>
<p>Frostbite is caused by the coagulation of blood in the sores. Initially, it is red and swollen, with unbearable pain and itching. After ulceration, there is a continuous flow of pus and even more pain. Every winter, this disease is particularly common, but there is a lack of good remedies, and patients suffer from it. Now, Zheng Xian Pharmacy (West Heng Street, Wing On Company, Nanjing Road) in this port has invented two miracle drugs: (1) "Pearl White Jade Ointment," used to treat broken frostbite, removes decay and promotes new growth, and its effect is rapid. (2) "Frostbite As You Wish Water," used to treat unbroken frostbite, stops pain and itching immediately, and reduces redness and swelling immediately. Its price is extremely low. "Pearl White Jade Ointment" is only sold for four dimes per box, and "Frostbite As You Wish Water" is sold for two dimes per bottle, two yuan per dozen. Wholesale is particularly cheap. Add two dimes for postage for out-of-town mail orders.</p>

<p>Liu Wenhui Defeated, Negotiating Peace with Chongqing</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Initiates Post-War Conference in Neijiang</p>
<p>The Entire 24th Army to Retreat to Xikang</p>
<p>Chongqing Telegraph: Previously, the 24th Army launched an all-out counterattack, occupying Rongxian, Weiyuan, and Qianwei, and advanced directly towards Yibin. Liu Wenhui's plan was to have Zhang Zhifang, Xiong Cihou, and Xu Tingxiu's three brigades press towards Luxian; Wang Yuanhu, Chen Zimin, and Li Yushu's three brigades seize Fushun and Ziliujing; Chen Mingqian, Lin Meipo, and Yu Ruhai's three brigades attack Ziyang from Renshou; and Liu Wencai and others provide support from the center. The remaining troops were to be concentrated in the rear areas of Jiarenjing and other places, hoping to recover the lost territory in one fell swoop. However, Liu Xiang anticipated this move and stationed heavy troops in Luxian and Ziliujing, constructing solid fortifications to resist. Seeing his plan fail, Liu Wenhui ordered all routes to attack simultaneously, resulting in a major battle on the 25th. Liu Xiang deployed all of his aircraft for a massive bombing campaign, resulting in over two thousand military and civilian casualties within the battle zones. The 24th Army's various routes, fearing the Chongqing army's aircraft, dared not advance. Liu Xiang then commanded his forces to launch a large-scale counterattack. The two sides engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat over ten times in Rongxian, Weiyuan, Qianwei, and other places. Ultimately, due to the Chongqing army's intense air power, the 24th Army's various routes were defeated and retreated to their original defense lines in Jingyan, Jiading, and Renshou. On the 26th, the 21st Army's various routes launched a fierce assault, again occupying Rongxian, Weiyuan, and Qianwei, and advanced towards Jiajing. Fierce battles took place in the areas of Liujia Village, Laijia Village, Lijia Village, and Laojun Terrace. The 24th Army resisted with all its might, using mortar fire to protect their positions. The 21st Army's frontline soldiers, with air cover, launched a fierce assault, advancing like a hot knife through butter. As a result, the 21st Army occupied the 24th Army's first line of defense between Jiajing. At the same time, Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou's forces launched a fierce attack on the Renshou front, engaging Chen Mingqian's brigade of the 24th Army in a fierce battle lasting approximately seven hours. Chen's troops were unable to withstand the attack, and Li and Luo's forces advanced and occupied the Beidouzhen and Yazi Pond areas, breaking through the 24th Army's first line of defense in Renjing at Laoshukou, Yujia Village, Changshan Bridge, Shuanggufen, and other places, directly threatening the second line of defense. Liu Wenhui was furious and immediately selected 5,000 elite soldiers from his army, organizing a suicide squad divided into plainclothes teams, pistol teams, bomb teams, broadsword teams, and rapid-response teams, launching a five-pronged counterattack against the 21st Army and Li and Luo's forces. They set out late at night on the 26th. The 5,000 desperate men, disregarding everything, charged fiercely at the enemy's positions. Despite constant machine-gun fire, shrapnel, and mortar bombardment, they showed no fear, charging wildly and smashing the 21st Army and Li and Luo's positions to pieces, as if entering an uninhabited area. Liu Xiang, Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, and others, seeing the ferocity and unstoppable momentum of the enemy's attack, also selected suicide squads to resist. The fighting continued until the morning of the 27th before both sides ceased operations. In this battle, the 21st Army suffered approximately 4,000 casualties, and Li and Luo's forces suffered approximately 2,000 casualties. Of the 24th Army's 5,000 suicide squad members, only 400 to 500 survived. Liu Wenhui then ordered all units to hold their ground, relying on fortifications to defend their positions and constructing solid fortifications to prepare for a protracted struggle. Seeing this situation, Liu Xiang feared that delaying the matter would create problems. To resolve the situation quickly, he launched a five-pronged attack on the 24th Army. The first route, under the command of Tang Shizun, Chen Lanting, and Mu Zhou, comprised five brigades attacking Jiading with the support of two aircraft. The second route, Pan Wenhua's division of three brigades, attacked Jingyan, also with two aircraft. The third route, Fan Shaozeng's division and the Model Division, comprised six brigades attacking Meishan and Qingshen, with one aircraft. The fourth route, Wang Zunxu's division of four brigades, attacked Renshou, with one aircraft. The fifth route, Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou's forces, attacked Xinjin and Shuangliu, attacking the 24th Army's rear. With each route properly deployed and heavy troops stationed on the front lines, preparations were made for a major battle. A general mobilization was scheduled for the 29th, with a simultaneous attack on the 24th Army. The battlefront extended over 300 li. The 21st Army's forces deployed to the front lines comprised five divisions and three brigades, totaling approximately 80,000 men, plus Li Qixiang and Luo Zezhou's forces, totaling over 100,000 men. The 24th Army also had approximately 100,000 men, but without aircraft, they found it difficult to resist. Liu Wenhui was quite anxious as a result and convened a military conference in Meishan with his key commanders to discuss countermeasures. The commanders unanimously agreed that the 24th Army was facing extreme danger and that it would be better to endure temporarily and preserve their strength rather than fight bitterly and lose their elite troops. Seeing that his commanders had no intention of fighting again, Liu Wenhui, who was usually headstrong, was also demoralized. He had no choice but to reluctantly comply with his commanders' opinions and negotiate peace with the Chongqing army. He had Leng Yindong and other senior commanders of the 24th Army send a telegram to Liu Xiang, requesting a halt to the attacks. Liu Wenhui also sent Du Shaotang as a representative to meet with Liu Xiang to negotiate everything. As a result, three conditions were agreed upon: (1) The 24th Army would hand over all of its Sichuan defense areas to the Allied Forces and retreat entirely to Xikang; (2) Liu Wenhui would relinquish his positions as commander of the 24th Army and chairman of Sichuan Province. All of his remaining troops would be led by Liu to Xikang; (3) The Allied Forces would recommend to the central government that Liu Wenhui be appointed chairman of Xikang Province and commander-in-chief of the Xikang Border Defense. As for all of Liu's property in Sichuan, the Allied Forces would be responsible for protecting it. After Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui approved and signed the above three articles, the fighting in the Jiajingren area completely ceased, and both sides stationed themselves on their original lines. Thus, this Sichuan war, which had lasted for nearly three months, finally had hope of ending. Liu Xiang, with this military expedition, aimed to unify the Sichuan situation. Now that a formidable enemy had been eliminated, other armies would be awed and submit. He then initiated a post-war conference in Neijiang to discuss the Sichuan situation, inviting the leaders of the various armies to participate in person. Liu himself had arrived in Neijiang on the 28th. Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Li Qixiang, and Luo Zezhou also set out. Liu Wenhui sent Leng Yindong and Du Shaotang as representatives. Currently, only Deng Xihou remained in Chengdu, not participating in person but sending Zeng Zhisong as a representative to the meeting. Liu Cunhou's representative, Liu Qian, was in Chengdu and had not yet departed. It is reported that the Chongqing side has largely formulated the issues to be discussed at the meeting, including: (1) resolving the 24th Army case; (2) unifying the Sichuan situation; (3) establishing a sound provincial government; (4) dividing the 24th Army's defense areas; (5) equalizing the Allied Forces' military quotas; (6) determining the Allied Forces' troop stationing; (7) allocating the Allied Forces' military expenses. It is said that Liu Xiang today again telegraphed Deng Xihou and Liu Cunhou, urging them to arrive by a specific date so that they could discuss matters together. There is talk that the meeting is scheduled to open on New Year's Day. Enclosed is Liu Wenhui's telegram of gratitude to Liu Xiang [To Director Liu Fucheng Jun Jian: My uncle and nephew have been at war for two months now. Although Hui has suffered heavy losses, so has nephew. I believe that the Sichuan situation, disorder, people's livelihood withered, and communist party secretly growing, should not continue to war, so Hui has to ask for peace with nephew, immediately cease fighting, discuss the aftermath, our family is engaged in farming for generations, with a pure reputation, from our uncle and two ancestors, gradually ascending to the academy, literary and military separating, and then entering the gentry family with a clean door, harmony, politeness, and harmony, there is a fixed evaluation in the countryside, our generation bears the shadow of our ancestors, should be a thick report of morality, the spirits of ancestors in heaven, how should we work hard with each other, without the shame of family voice, unfortunately my uncle and nephew are facing each other in war, so that all people are suffering, stirring up the red tide, losing shame to the green history, if we silently remember the outside of the fog mountain, where the ancestral tomb is located, the area where we played and fished in childhood, the mountain hermit knows, and should not cry, so Hui does not take seeking peace as shame, and stopping soldiers as cowardice, please nephew stop the soldiers from advancing, and deal with them appropriately, in a hurry, or inevitably straightforward, but also pray for forgiveness, and hope to see teachings, without any task of building and looking forward to it, Wenhui Yin,] (December 29)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Han Fuju and Li Shuchun Return to Jinan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, previously to report on the resolution of the Jiaodong incident and to discuss North China's security, on the 23rd, accompanied by Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, took a special train to Ping, met with Zhang Xueliang, and met with North China's generals, to discuss everything. Originally scheduled to return to Jinan on the 28th, but was retained by the principals, until 4 pm on the 29th, together with Shen Honglie and Jiang Bocheng took a special train south, and arrived in Jinan at 8:50 this morning (30th), Han Shen and others got off the train, exchanged greetings with the welcomers, and then took a car to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest, and I immediately went to visit, and had the following conversation with Han, (Q) What is the recent situation in Rehe? (A)</p>
<p>Our army has small conflicts with the Japanese army from time to time, but not as much as reported. (Q) During this trip to Ping, the North China Political Affairs Conference was held. Are there any concrete plans for maintaining North China's security and resisting insults? (A) Of course there are plans, but it is about resisting insults, so it is not convenient to publish them. (Q) What are your thoughts on this trip? (A) I feel very good both internally and externally, because the generals north of the Yangtze River met in Beiping as scheduled, and they all have great determination to resist insults and defend the territory, which is even more激ang than Xia , because they are united externally and more united internally, so the results of the meeting are very satisfactory. (Q) What did Director Zhang say? (A) Director Zhang's attitude is also very firm. Zhang was initially afraid that the generals' opinions would be different and had many concerns. Now that he sees that the generals are all determined to resist insults to the death, he is relieved. (Q) What about the defenses of Yantai and Longkou? (A) This matter is even less of a problem. It is now maintained by the Navy, and the ground is calm. If land forces are needed in the future, the Third Route Army can send people there. In Ping, Director Zhang also repeatedly expressed his intention to order the Third Route Army to send teams to take over the defense. In fact, I can discuss this matter directly with Commander Shen.</p>
<p>The Director of Civil Affairs of Shandong Province, Li Shuchun, who inspected Jiaodong, departed from Jinan on the 22nd and visited Weixian, Changyi, Yexian, Longkou, Yantai, Huangxian, Fushan, Qixia, and Laiyang. In just one week, he inspected various institutions and prisons, and checked the public security bureau and the militia. He paid particular attention to the counties that had suffered losses in the war. After inspecting Laiyang on the 27th, he arrived in Pingdu on the afternoon of the 28th for inspection. He left Pingdu early in the morning of the 29th and arrived in Jiaozhou. He visited various institutions in the morning, and at 1:30 in the afternoon, he took the Beiping steel-armored car back west. Because the car was quite heavy, it was slow to drive, and it did not arrive until 1:30 in the morning of the 30th. According to Li's words at the station, this inspection covered a total of ten counties, and a total of twelve places including Yantai and Longkou. The overall situation is generally good. The autonomy of each county is also quite good. The district chiefs of each county are all graduates of the Provincial District Chief Training Institute, so they are able to perform their duties in handling autonomy. Then he took a car to the Civil Affairs Department to rest. (December 30)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Fujian Northern Generals' Bandit Suppression Plan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhennian's Division Has Been Stationed in Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The northern Fujian Red Bandits were defeated by the joint efforts of Mao Weisou and Liu Heding's two divisions, and Shaowu and Guangze counties were successively recovered. At that time, the northern Fujian Red Bandits retreated into eastern Jiangxi and were intercepted and attacked by Chen Cheng's army. They then fled from Lichuan and Zixi, sneaking into the border between Guangze and Chong'an, looting wantonly. Jianning and Taining counties were still occupied by the rebel soldiers of the former Sun Lianzhong. Although these rebel soldiers claimed to be Red Army soldiers, they were not commanded by Zhu De and had no system. They had already become bandits. A few days ago, generals Mao Weisou, Liu Heding, Zhou Zhiqun, and Qian Yuguang held a military meeting in Shaowu to discuss ways to suppress these scattered bandits. It was decided that in addition to sending troops to guard important cities and towns, each division and brigade would also send out a number of troops to form guerrilla teams, penetrate deep into the bandit areas, track and eliminate them, and strive to clear the bandit traces in the four counties of Guangchong, Jian, and Tai in the shortest possible time. Then, they would contact the Jiangxi army and launch a joint attack on the large bandit gangs. Yesterday, the plan was telegraphed to the Pacification Office for approval. In addition, Liang Lizhu and Zhao Zhenqi's two brigades of Liu Zhennian's 21st Division have successively entered the counties of Pucheng, Songxi, Zhenghe, and Shouning in Fujian from the Zhejiang border. Han Meicen, the representative sent by Liu Zhennian to Fujian, also went from Fuzhou to Yanping to Shaowu to meet Mao Weisou and Liu Heding to discuss defense deployment measures. Also, yesterday, the Provincial Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs, informing that Liu's division was transferred to Fujian to suppress the bandits, and the expenses related to departure and supply were to be raised by themselves. If there is any misappropriation from the local area, it should also be returned and padded. As for the Shandong notes brought, Director Liu should negotiate with the local Chamber of Commerce to find a way to cash them on a regular basis to avoid disputes. The Provincial Government immediately telegraphed the magistrates of Pu, Song, Shou, and Zheng counties to inform them. (December 26)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Past and Present of Jiangxi Province's Russian Black Tea Sales <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Silk, tea, and porcelain are the main export products of our country. Among them, porcelain is unique to Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province, and tea is also a major product of Jiangxi Province. Russian black tea, produced in Xiushui and Tonggu, ranks first. At this time of Sino-Russian resumption of diplomatic relations and mutual progress in the two countries' commerce, a brief description of the past and present situation of Jiangxi tea is provided below.</p>
<p>Xiushui, Tonggu, Wuning, Fuliang, Dexing, Yushan, and other places in Jiangxi Province are tea-producing areas. The Xiutong area is full of lush tea trees. According to rough estimates, the total tea production of the province in its heyday was about 500,000 boxes (100 catties per box). The average price per box, calculated at 30 yuan, would also be 15 million yuan. In addition to the coarse tea, tea stalks, and green tea sold to various parts of the country and the province, the refined black tea was exclusively sold to Russia, and green tea sold well in Europe, America, Japan, and the Nanyang Islands. Exports abroad were between six million and ten million. According to a survey by the Department of Construction, in 1926, Xiushui and Tonggu counties produced 19,000 boxes of overseas black tea, 7,600 boxes of leaf tea, 51,000 boxes of powdered tea, 12,000 boxes of store tea, 2,100 boxes of tea stalks, and 6,000 boxes of green tea. In that year, the mountain price of overseas black tea was 70 yuan per box. From the mountain to the sales destination, the cost per box was 27 yuan and 78 cents, and the selling price was only 47 yuan and 78 cents. More than 90 tea houses and shops lost 887,593 yuan. In 1927, a total of 52,000 boxes (5 million catties) of the above-mentioned teas were produced. More than 70 tea houses and shops, seeing the excessive losses in the previous year, lowered the mountain price. The mountain price of overseas tea (the essence of tea) was only 30 yuan, plus the cost of more than 27 yuan, the cost was 57 yuan, and the selling price was 75 yuan, with a total profit of 864,279 taels. In 1928, tea shops saw sluggish overseas sales and only produced 22,000 boxes of overseas black tea. The amount of leaf tea, store tea, and green tea sold domestically reached 103,800 boxes. Although the mountain price of overseas tea was only 47 yuan, more than 90 tea shops still lost more than 280,000 taels of regulations. Since then, things have gone from bad to worse. International sales have been completely taken over by Ceylon and Japanese tea. In addition, years of banditry have turned houses into ruins, and the future of the tea industry is unbearable to hear and unbearable in the past and present. According to tea veterans in Xiushui and the provincial capital, (1) farmers have no tea-growing knowledge at all. They only use their spare time from farming to plant on mountain foothills. They do not pay attention to cultivation, pruning, harvesting, or pest control, resulting in low production and poor quality. (2) In terms of roasting, they stick to the old ways. For example, black tea is dried in the sun. If it rains, it will become moldy. How can one expect it to be refined? (3) Tea operators mostly buy and sell empty-handed. Most of their capital comes from loans. If the tea is still in transit, they will mortgage the bill of lading to foreign merchants, suffering all kinds of exploitation. When the goods arrive at the destination, foreign merchants can arbitrarily manipulate and suppress them, and they all lose money. Because of the losses, the transporters add water and tea stalks and change their appearance, using all kinds of tricks to cheat and seek profit, resulting in a loss of trust with foreign merchants. (1) The tea tax used to be very heavy, directly increasing costs and indirectly affecting the livelihoods of tea farmers and tea merchants. In addition, transportation was inconvenient, and extortion along the way was even more unbearable. (4) Our country's tea-growing methods have not been improved, and the authorities are constantly harassing us, so we cannot compete with Ceylon tea. (5) Since 1927, places such as Xiushui, Wuning, and Dexing have mostly been occupied by bandits. The tea is old on the mountain, and no one picks it. Even if there are a few products, merchants and travelers are afraid to travel. The Xiutong tea trees are now only used as fuel. Now that China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, if we want to reorganize our forces and revive the tea industry, we should clear all of the above reasons and strive for improvement so that we can develop. It is said that Provincial Chairman Xiong Shihui, in order to develop the tea industry, had a plan to set up a large-scale tea factory in Jiujiang or Xiushui. (1) Establish tea gardens and tea factories, (2) establish a tea industry bank to circulate capital, (3) attract merchants to operate and transport publicly, (4) improve the tea tax, reward exports, and restore the international market. However, it is not known when it will be implemented. (December 27)</p>

<p>Boats traveling to Dongshan have been repeatedly robbed by bandits. Recently, the Yutai small boat was again surrounded and robbed by bandits at Huangyang Bay in Dongshan, injuring police and robbing equipment, killing people, and kidnapping. Now, the bandit leader in this case, Wang Guangheng, from Luoshan, Henan, was on a boat moored behind the Duanqiao bank of the Sulun Yarn Factory outside Panmen, Suzhou City, and was captured by the No. 3 District of the Water Police. After interrogation, he confessed that he had robbed the firearms of the Seventh Squad of the Water Police at that time and buried them near Hengjing Hengshan. (31) The district sent detectives to the countryside with the bandit Wang to recover the guns.</p>
<p>The remaining criminals are now being searched for.</p>

<p>Hu Fuxiang, an employee of the Hankou Bank of China, 24 years old, from Yuyao, embezzled more than 100,000 yuan from the bank this autumn and took the Hankou prostitute Zhang Suzhen by plane to Shanghai, then transferred to Hangzhou, and came to Suzhou to hide at No. 7 Xiaomushuxiang outside Panmen, using the alias Lu Zhongliang. After Hu embezzled the money and absconded, the bank immediately posted a notice to arrest him. At about 12 o'clock on the night before (30th), the No. 3 Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau suddenly found out about this and sent police to arrest him, and seized a Jiangsu Bank passbook with 2,100 yuan. The furnishings in the Xiaomushuxiang house were quite exquisite. According to his confession, the remaining money has all been spent on prostitution and gambling.</p>

<p>Wang Ziquan, a partner of Yuan Maoshun South Goods Store in Xishi, Zhitang Town, County, has served in the store for more than 30 years. Recently, as the end of the year approached and the economy was difficult, he developed a sense of world-weariness. At dawn on the 29th, while people were asleep, he drowned himself in the Houhe River behind the pawnshop. By the time people discovered and salvaged him, he had died. In addition, Bu Shouqing, a farmer from Xiajiaqiao in the Second District, committed suicide by hanging himself because the end of the year was approaching and creditors were pressing him for payment, and he could not cope. In addition, Lu Jinming, a villager from Shuichezhai in the Ninth District, also committed suicide by hanging himself because of years of debt and no way to make up for it as the end of the year approached.</p>

<p>Lei Yin (Weinan), Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangxi, was approved by the Provincial Government to go to Jiangsu and other provinces to investigate domestic goods production in order to transport them to Guangxi for sales, because domestic goods have been selling well and foreign goods have been decreasing in the province in recent years, in order to further promote domestic goods. Director Lei came to Wuxi from Nanjing the day before yesterday and stayed at the Provincial Education College of Sheqiao. The principal, Gao Jianhui, and Xue Mingjian, the chief executive of Shen , accompanied him to visit various factories to investigate and inspect, so as to order and promote sales.

<p>Hengyi Silver Shop in Suzhou was broken into by thieves who dug a hole at about 3:00 on the night of the 11th of this month, and a large number of silver ornaments were stolen, about 200 taels, worth about 500 yuan. Subsequently, the manager of the shop reported to the Detective Team of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, and detective Shi Jingsheng and others arrested the thief Zhu Er outside the Xiaocai Bank outside Panmen. He immediately took the team to interrogate him, and the thief confessed that there were accomplices hiding in Wuxi, etc. The detective and the thief Zhu Er came to Wuxi yesterday afternoon to recover the stolen goods, and indeed arrested a person named Wang Renquan, who sold the stolen goods, at Qingming Bridge, Nanmen, in the city. He was immediately sent to the No. 3 Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau. After the director of the sub-bureau, Yu, opened a preliminary hearing, the thief confessed that the stolen goods had been sold to Yuanyuan Silver Shop, and he sent police officers to recover the original stolen silver ornaments of 11 taels. He then took the shop's owner, Zhang Yunchu, to the bureau and transferred him to the County Public Security Bureau. After the head of the Third Section, Wu, opened a court for interrogation, he ordered that all the witnesses in the case be handed over to the detectives from Wuxian to take back and handle the case.</p>

<p>According to a confidential report, the Third Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau of Liantang Town in the seventh district of the county seized a large number of red pills and opium, totaling more than 200,000 yuan. Afterwards, the sub-bureau kept the matter quite secret. Later, after newspapers published it, the Public Security Bureau paid special attention, and it also caused a sensation in the city. The day before yesterday, the Public Security Bureau sent Inspector Lu Baozhong to the countryside to investigate, and he has returned to the city. According to his report to the General Bureau, this did not happen, and the report was completely fabricated. Gu Ben, the director of the Liantang Third Sub-bureau, also published a large notice denying the above facts. However, according to rumors in the countryside, the case was mediated by a powerful Chen from Yangjian and a Pan from Donggangjing. As a result, it was proposed that Xu Genlin, the boatman who carried the drugs, be attached with a few opium bubbles as an ordinary opium offender and sent to the county government for approval. In addition to taking a percentage of the seized drugs as a reward, a monthly subsidy of 250 yuan was also paid, and both parties were very satisfied. Fearing that Xu Genlin would keep the secret, the mediators tried to solve it together, and made it completely nothing. As a result, the huge earthwork case that caused a sensation in the city will come to an end from now on. However, it is heard that the county government authorities, because this matter is serious, intend to send personnel again to re-</p>

<p>The County Anti-Japanese Association received a secret report yesterday, saying that the Guangyao Electric Light Company and its business department in this port had a large number of Japanese electrical materials hidden. After receiving the report, the association immediately sent inspectors to the business department of the company and found various Japanese goods. Then they went to the company to inspect, but were surrounded by the company's workers, who illegally detained five inspectors and beat and insulted them. After the inspectors begged, they were able to escape and report back to the association. The association immediately held a temporary meeting and resolved that 1. the company's act of selling Japanese goods during the period of economic severance with Japan should be severely punished. Considering that the matter concerns local public welfare, the fine will be reduced to 10,000 yuan, and the Japanese goods will be confiscated, and the non-Japanese goods will be returned. 2. The company's employees' act of publicly gathering a crowd to use violence to coerce and obstruct the inspectors will be investigated separately.</p>

<p>Willing to Rebuild the City Area After the Calamity with All Citizens</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, wrote a New Year's greeting to the citizens, saying that today is the first day of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. As the mayor of Shanghai, he has just been in office and is mindful of the difficulties. He is willing to express his sincerity to all the citizens of Shanghai. The past year has been the most difficult and painful time since the opening of Shanghai. The national crisis began in the autumn of the year before last, and in a few months, this city was struck by an unexpected disaster. Fortunately, all the citizens of the city deeply understood the importance of the situation and turned the tide. Their spirit and perseverance at that time have attracted worldwide attention, and the post-disaster stabilization and maintenance are well-known to those in positions of power. In particular, the fact that all the citizens have been able to cooperate to turn this difficult and dilapidated situation to the path of recovery is something that Wu Tiecheng is very pleased about. The old year has passed, but the national crisis remains. This city is the center of the national financial and industrial sectors, and its prosperity, decline, safety, and danger are of great importance to the national plan. Wu Tiecheng is willing to work with all the citizens of the city to respond to this difficult situation with the spirit of perseverance, resilience, and unyielding, and to rebuild the city area after the calamity. The past is like that, and the future is like this. Adversity builds the nation, and adversity inspires the sage.

<h3 id="e83">Yan Baohang Talks About the Strength and Status of the Volunteer Army <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Military Strength is Confirmed to be More Than 300,000, and the Retreat of the Soviet Army Has No Impact</p>
<p>Yan Baohang, a representative of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association and a director of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association, came to Shanghai from Peiping a few days ago. The reporter took a special trip to visit him at his residence. He answered in detail about the strength and status of the Northeast Volunteer Army. Now it is urgently disclosed as follows. Since the active activities of the Northeast Volunteer Army this summer, the news here has been extremely dull. The reports from various parties have not been detailed. After all, the Northeast Volunteer Army can be divided into four aspects due to geographical relations: Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. 1. The Liaoning Volunteer Army, in the green gauze tent, was oppressed by the Japanese enemy. Tang Juwu's 30,000 troops in Liaodong had to temporarily hide and wait for opportunities to act. The 30,000 troops under Deng Tiemei, Li Zirong, and Liu Jingwen are fighting the Japanese enemy in Xiuyan, Zhuanghe, and Fengcheng. They have repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. This unit has strong strength, excellent discipline, and rich experience after years of bloody battles. Moreover, the terrain is dangerous, and it is easy to defend and difficult to attack. It can definitely last for a long time. Although the enemy launched a large-scale attack, they suffered losses for more than half a month. The 25,000 troops under Zhu Jiqing, Liu Zhendong, Liu Guitang, Zheng Guilin, etc. in western Liaoning have now been fully replenished and are acting in Suizhong, Xingcheng, Jinxi, and Yixian to contain the enemy. As for the small units of the Volunteer Army lurking in the entire Liaoning Province, there are still 10,000 people. 2. The Jilin Volunteer Army is mainly composed of Ding Chao, Li Shuan, and Wang Delin. Ding and Li's troops have 75,000 people, and Wang Delin's troops have 25,000 people. They are fighting the enemy in more than a dozen counties in eastern Jilin, such as Mishan, Baoqing, Tongjiang, and Dunhua. The Japanese are limited by the dangerous terrain and cannot succeed even if they try to attack. In addition, there are Volunteer Armies under Tian Lin, Fu Dianchen, and Li Futing, numbering no less than 10,000, who are active in the Acheng area and attack Harbin from time to time. The enemy troops are extremely worried. 3. The Heilongjiang Volunteer Army still has 56,000 people, including 20,000 under Deng Wen, more than 10,000 under Li Haiqing, a total of 10,000 under Xu Zihe and Xu Jingde, 4,000 under Pu Bingshan, and 5,000 under Chai Hongyou, all under General Ma. As for Su Bingwen's army, which originally had only 10,000 people, except for the 3,000 people who have retreated into Russia, the 7,000 people under Zhang Dianjiu, the commander of the forward, are still in a certain place in Heilongjiang, contacting the various troops of General Ma, and contacting the enemy from time to time. A certain commissioner of the association went to Heilongjiang twice, totaling eight months. He personally inspected the various armies and witnessed the combat process. He returned recently after the retreat of the Soviet army. According to him, the morale of the various armies is extremely high, and the retreat of the Soviet army has no impact. However, due to insufficient military strength, they urgently need assistance. This is a critical moment for the army, and the people of the country should quickly find ways to help. 4. The Japanese army has been plotting for Rehe for a long time. The people of the province are aware of this and have already organized people's groups to prepare for self-defense. Once something happens, they can fight. The most important thing is to concentrate the 30,000 cavalry under Feng Zhanhai on the border. This unit has been fully replenished and is a strong army. In short, these more than 300,000 strong men have vowed to fight the enemy to the death and will never retreat. The entire people of the Northeast, unable to bear the slaughter and trampling of the Japanese invaders, have unanimously risen up to cooperate with the Volunteer Army to save themselves. They only hope that the whole country will unite as one and actively provide spiritual and material assistance in order to recover the lost land and return our rivers and mountains. This would be very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Sun Ke Issues a Statement <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Significance of Implementing Constitutional Government and the Understanding That the People Should Have</p>
<p>Sun Ke issued a statement saying that since the founding of the Republic of China, the country has been in danger and the people's livelihood has been in decline, and there has never been a situation as serious as today. The people of the country are sighing and lamenting, sitting in a city of sorrow every day, as if they are waiting to die with their hands tied, and there is nothing they can do. However, they do not know that the national crisis is , and the people's hearts have not died. There are many ways to save the country, and it is already time to do something after . This is why I still have to say a word on this New Year's Day to inform the people of the country and encourage myself. The people of the country have countless expectations for our party comrades after years of ruling, and our party comrades have also worked hard day and night in their work. However, if we examine its effectiveness and calculate its daily strength, it is not only that people have said that there are many dissatisfactions, but even our party comrades, in the quiet of the night, examine themselves and ask themselves, and why are they not panicking and sweating endlessly? The reason for this is nothing more than the lack of sincerity in unity. If we look at the political situation in recent years, the reason why disputes have emerged endlessly is that our party comrades are suspicious of each other, so that the small ones have different ambitions, and the struggle of factions arises from this. The big ones have evolved into the ups and downs of political tides due to conflicts of rights, and wars cannot but continue because of this. Therefore, the doctrine cannot be implemented, the construction cannot be advanced, and the suffering of the people's livelihood has increased. Foreign troubles and internal worries have come one after another. The loss of the three northeastern provinces is only the most prominent of its bad results. Knowing that the source of chaos lies in the lack of sincerity in unity among the people of the country, there is no other way for us to correct the mistakes of the past than to open our hearts to each other in sincerity. This statement may seem like a idealistic theory on the surface, which is not suitable for the circumstances, but if we carefully examine it and prove it with the actual conclusion, we should not treat it as a empty theory. Our country has a population of 400 million, and the number of people is unparalleled in the world, but its strength is not as good as a small country, because it is a plate of loose sand. No matter how large the number is, how can it withstand the ravages of storms without failing? The Kuomintang of China is the only political party in our country with organization, doctrine, and history. However, in recent years, factions have emerged, and forces have been dispersed, resulting in fragmentation and mutual deception. Comrades are too busy killing and excluding each other, so how can they focus their minds and talents on promoting the doctrine? Therefore, the Communists are rampant and cannot be eliminated, and the imperialists are invading and cannot be resisted. There is a reason for this. Therefore, we only hope that the people of the whole country will be able to eliminate the heart of selfishness, then the suspicion will be eliminated, and if the suspicion is eliminated, then the strength of unity can be consolidated. If the strength of unity is consolidated, then the ability to defend oneself will be strengthened, just like a plate of loose sand is mixed with viscous matter, and the strong and firm cement can be established and waited for its completion. Sincerity is like the viscous quality. Without sincerity, the unity is not strong. This is why we focus on sincerity. It is not without purpose.</p>
<p>However, what is described above is abstract. If there is only sincerity, but there is no concrete fact to follow, then the way to save the country is still far away. What is the concrete fact? That is, what kind of system should be adopted to be sufficient to suit the sincere expression of the people of the whole country, and to be sufficient to suit the trend of unity of the people of the whole country, so that the actions of the entire nation can be planned carefully in advance, so that the minds and talents of the people of the whole country can contribute to the survival of the country and the prosperity of the nation. Then the restoration of national fortune can double its speed. In the past, the Prime Minister once stipulated the revolutionary program as three periods: military government, tutelage, and constitutional government. Now the military government period is over, and the tutelage period has also been tried for several years. How effective is it? We will not discuss it in detail for the time being. However, in this current national crisis, when we must concentrate our national strength to save the country, we should adopt the system that is most suitable for concentrating our national strength. I proposed the "Program for Resisting Japan and Saving the Country" this spring, advocating the end of the tutelage in the shortest possible time and preparing for the start of constitutional government. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee repeated its meaning this time and proposed the "Concentrating National Strength to Save the Country", also taking the preparation for the start of constitutional government as its premise. It has been passed by the plenary session and can be carried out step by step. Because the party rule in recent years has been affected by political groups, the efficiency is low, the expectations of the people have been deep, and the faith in our party has not been gradually lost, so that the national strength cannot be concentrated, and it cannot resist foreign aggression. This is something that our party comrades did not expect, and it is not a good policy for the current urgent environment. This is why I resolutely promote constitutional government as a remedy. However, while we are preparing for the start of constitutional government, we should also step up the unfinished work during the tutelage period, so that on the one hand, the party rule can come to an end, and on the other hand, the goal of concentrating the strength of the entire nation can be achieved. Internally, we can eliminate the communists, and externally, we can resist the powerful enemies, so as to restore the fate of the Chinese nation and seek the supreme plan for survival.</p>
<p>However, the realization of constitutional government is even more difficult than military government and tutelage. If the people of the country think that once the constitution is formulated, promulgated and implemented, they can easily obtain the good results of constitutional government, it is a big mistake. Because before the national government prepares for the start of constitutional government, the mission of the Kuomintang comrades on the facilities of constitutional government is doubled, and the responsibility of the people of the whole country is also more important than before. The merits of the work during the tutelage period can still be blamed on the Kuomintang, and the merits of constitutional government are the responsibility of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the people must raise their spirits and pay attention to political issues. At the same time, they must fully express their will in a proper manner. On the negative side, they must be able to prevent the old evils in politics, so that the corrupt forces cannot raise their heads. On the positive side, they should urge the government to carry out construction projects to relieve the suffering of the people's livelihood. Then they will not live up to the good name of constitutional government, and the initial intention of promoting and implementing constitutional government. If they repeat the mistakes of the early years of the Republic of China and only provide opportunities for politicians to make trouble, then it is not what we expect from the people. However, if someone holds this to challenge the implementation of constitutional government, then they will fall into the disease of giving up eating because of choking. It is like parents seeing their children stumbling when they are learning to walk, so they forbid them to try again. Then the children will never learn to walk. Is this the attitude that parents should take? Even the most foolish people know that it is impossible. The meaning of promoting constitutional government today is also the same. It must not be said that it should cause stumbles, and it should not be allowed to try again. It all depends on how much we maintain and support.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Shao Yuanchong Discusses the Affairs of the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that after the recent Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, there have been various rumors outside about the reorganization of the Legislative Yuan. A few days ago, Shao Yuanchong, the acting president of the Legislative Yuan, came to Shanghai for recuperation. The reporter took a special trip to visit him at his residence yesterday and asked him about the process and his opinions on the future conduct of the Legislative Yuan. According to Shao, I have been acting as the president of the Legislative Yuan twice, and I deeply believe that the responsibility of legislation is related to the rise and fall of the rule of law. Therefore, on the one hand, I promoted the progress of legislative work to build the foundation of the rule of law. At the same time, I also tried my best to recruit academic experts for the committee members and staff to create an academic political institution. Therefore, since I have been acting as the president of the Legislative Yuan twice, I have strived for stability in the institution itself, made progress on the right track, sought progress in the current situation, and created an academic institution. The effects of its facilities have been well received by the general public and the international community. I have also upheld the meaning of "leading and working hard", and I go to the court every day to do my best to be responsible and to promote it. In the past two years, the court meetings have never been interrupted once. I have only been to Shanghai twice, once when the comrades in Guangdong came to Shanghai last winter to meet and talk to promote internal unity, and once in July of this year, when Mr. Yingshi's Memorial Hall was completed, Mr. Chen Aishi telegraphed to attend the meeting and report on Mr. Yingshi's history. That's all. At other times, even when the presidents of the various courts were completely away from Beijing, I still stayed in Beijing to maintain the credibility of the government. This is the past that can be checked. During the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee this time, the Central Committee urged Sun Ke to come and preside over the affairs of the court. I have no prejudice. As for the relationship between Comrade Sun and me, except that during the plenary session, I had to visit the general Central Committee members, so I passed by the Lizhi Society and dropped a name card. There was no contact with Comrade Sun in the Lizhi Society. Only on the morning of the closing of the plenary session, when I went to the Central Party Headquarters, because the meeting had not yet started, I had a three- or four-minute conversation with Comrade Sun in the rest room of the conference hall. I took the meaning of "the old Yin's policy must be told to the new Yin". Regarding the future affairs of the court, I put forward two principles to Comrade Sun: 1. The original members of the Legislative Yuan, except for those who cannot hold concurrent positions due to concurrent positions, should continue as much as possible with the old members who have rich academic qualifications and experience, so that the original legislative work will not be interrupted. Other newly appointed members must be based on the academic qualifications, qualifications, and professional knowledge that the court needs, so that the content can be enriched. For the staff, they should be based on the central government's laws and regulations to protect civil servants, and should be changed less to prevent the affairs from being stopped. Such facts of protecting civil servants have been found in various courts in recent years. For example, after the death of Premier Tan, President Chiang also served as the head of the Executive Yuan, and the original Secretary-General Lu Bichou and other personnel were not changed. After Comrade Ju Juesheng became the President of the Judicial Yuan, the original Secretary-General Xie Guansheng and others were not changed. When the Control Yuan was established, Comrade Chen Guofu served as the acting president of the court and appointed Comrade Yang Pusheng as the Secretary-General. Later, after the President took office, they have not been changed for many years. These are all facts that can be proved. Therefore, what I talked to Comrade Sun at that time was entirely for the sake of maintaining legislative work, so I advocated enriching the candidates for the committee members and changing the internal affairs less. That's all. There is absolutely no intention to ask Comrade Sun to accommodate the list I submitted and the personnel who need to be retained in the candidates or staff, or to have any other conditions. As for Comrade Sun's statement that the list should be submitted in the name of the President of the Court, there are indeed such written regulations in the Organic Law of the National Government. In fact, the political procedure of the Kuomintang is a complex procedure, and in fact, the appointment of political officials must first be decided at the Political Conference, and then the National Government will issue the appointment. This has been a long-standing practice. Therefore, the appointment of the first and second legislative members was jointly submitted by former President Hu and Vice President Lin to the Central Political Council for approval. These are all precedents that can be checked. Therefore, I have no right to abandon this right to jointly propose a motion in the Central Political Council, and the Central Political Council cannot abandon its authority before the power to appoint political officials in the Central Political Council is abolished. As for the rumors that I resigned due to disagreements and that the central government comforted me, etc., they are completely inconsistent with the facts. My departure is always at the command of the central government, and I have no prejudice. When no one is responsible for the affairs of the court, I am acting as the president of the court, and there is nothing to hand over, so how can I give up suddenly? Within a few days, when my illness is slightly better, I should return to Beijing and wait quietly for the central government to decide on a solution. It is not convenient to express any opinions at this time. However, what I am earnestly hoping that the central government and the people of the country will pay attention to at this time is that the foundation of the Republic of China depends on the rise and fall of the rule of law. The ruling party and the people must pay attention to the principles of morality and law, and then politics can be advanced from the normal track. Today, ordinary party members have also advocated shortening the tutelage and starting constitutional government. However, under what conditions can the tutelage be completed? It must be in the progress and completion of the general political facilities, so that the government</p>

<p>Kidnapped on the 28th, Almost Met With Disaster, Escaped on the 31st, Fortunately Uninjured</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Zhang Junguang, Standing Director of the National Joint Association of Salvation Organizations of All Circles, suddenly went missing. He safely escaped danger yesterday morning, the 31st. The news was met with joy. Upon hearing this news, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency immediately went to Zhang's residence in the French Concession to inquire, but the entire family was out. Later, guided by Miss Zhou Shihua, Zhang's fiancée, to a hospital in western Shanghai, they were able to meet with Mr. Zhang and have a half-hour conversation. Mr. Zhang recounted</p>
<p>the kidnapping process in great detail. According to him, around 11:00 AM on the 28th, he went out to meet with Mr. Lin Kanghou at the Bankers' Association. After taking his leave, he took Tram No. 17 on Beijing Road to the intersection of Huajin Lane on Fourth Road. Walking east, he intended to go to the Sino-Western Pharmacy to discuss advertisements for the association's special publication. Unexpectedly, after walking only a few steps, two burly men suddenly appeared with pistols and seized him to take him away. At that time, he knew things were not good, but with pistols pressing tightly against his waist on both sides, he had no ability to resist. He could only follow them, turning into a side road in Maijia Circle, where a car pulled up. He was forced into the car, and black-painted glasses were put on him. The car then drove off, and he could no longer see anything, only hearing the sounds of trams and ships' horns outside the car. After the car had been driving for a long time, he was taken into a house and detained in a room. It was airtight and he did not hear any sounds. In the evening, a woman brought him dinner, but fearing other motives, he did not eat it despite being hungry.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, the two men came again, still with the glasses, and took him into a car. They drove even further, and there was no noise outside the car. After a long time, he was taken into a small boat, his hands were tied behind his back, and he was ordered to lie in the cabin. The boat's hatch was tightly covered, and he had no idea where he was. There were also guards at both ends of the cabin, and he was given food, which was simple and inedible. In the evening, a man suddenly arrived and whispered to the person at the stern of the boat for a long time. The words were not very clear, but it seemed to be: "This is the right person. [對的]" "Tomorrow you can collect the money." Before leaving, he repeatedly urged them to be careful in guarding him.</p>
<p>At noon on the 30th, it was the third day of his kidnapping. Everything was the same as before, with no changes. In the afternoon, another person arrived, and the guard asked if the money had been received. The man replied, "No, I'm afraid we'll have to wait until tomorrow." The guard said, "[Wait 慢], it's not too late to strike after we get the money." After staying for a moment, the man left. At this point, Mr. Zhang knew his life was in danger and was eagerly thinking of a way to escape. However, the guards were strict, making it difficult to slip through. He looked around, but had no good plan. Just as he was anxious, he suddenly saw a small knife inserted on the awning, like the kind used by Jiangbei peddlers to peel water chestnuts. He considered it carefully. At night, the cold air was biting, and he lay in the cabin, shivering and trembling. The guards, due to days of hard work, were very tired and all dozed off. He seized this opportunity and carefully cut the ropes binding his hands behind his back with the knife, little by little. After about two or three hours, he finally freed himself. Just as he was about to crawl out of the cabin, the person guarding the entrance of the boat suddenly went out to urinate and stood at the bow of the boat. At this time, Mr. Zhang did not move, held his breath, tiptoed up behind him, and pushed him hard from behind, causing him to fall into the river. He then</p>
<p>ran ashore in a hurry. He ran wildly in the darkness. The guards seemed to be chasing closely behind him, but fortunately the moonlight was dim, and he finally escaped. After walking for about a few hours, the weather gradually cleared, and he saw railway tracks. After asking the locals several times, he arrived at Jiangwan, where he hired a car to a friend's house and was able to inform his family. At this point, he finally turned danger into safety, fortunately without injury, only feeling extremely tired and in need of rest, he said. Later, Mr. Zhang also</p>
<p>made a statement, saying, "Since the Manchurian Incident, the aggression of Japanese imperialists has become increasingly serious, but they only fear the volunteer armies outside the passes and the national anti-Japanese organizations. Although I dare not determine who instigated this kidnapping, it is very clear that they want to undermine the national salvation movement. This safe return is truly a great blessing in misfortune. From now on, I will continue to work hard to see it through to the end, and I will never be subdued by violence." Furthermore, according to</p>
<p>another report, Mr. Zhang's near-disaster caused anxiety among former Kuomintang elders in Shanghai, such as Zhou Zhenlin, and Central Committee members such as Cheng Qian and Li Liejun, who personally went to inquire. They are overjoyed that he has returned safe and sound. As for Mr. Zhang, due to physical exhaustion, he took a car to Hangzhou that evening to rest.</p>

<p>those who are already on the right track even more on the right track, and those who have achieved results even more results, and to make other agencies that have not yet achieved results work together on achieving results, then political tutelage can be completed. Otherwise, if all agencies tend to be lax and filled with stagnation, even if there are one or two facilities that are on the right track and agencies with relatively commendable results, they will inevitably become chaotic and degenerate. The comrades in the central government have a common responsibility for the future of politics, which I will not neglect. Now that the country is in crisis and the building is about to collapse, the responsibility for saving the country is shared by the government and the people. But as long as there is someone to take over, I am willing to engage in more arduous work to save the country, and I will never be content with inaction and be a pampered sparrow."</p>

Currently, in addition to submitting a request to the provincial government to inspect and accept the project, County Magistrate Yan has specifically decided to go to the new government buildings today, New Year's Day, to inspect everything in order to arrange the interior. At the same time, he has notified the Finance, Construction, and Education Bureaus, the Property Office, and all the staff of the county government to visit together, and a discussion meeting will be held in the new government buildings.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Successfully Strives for the Abolition of the Suzhou-Hangzhou Navigation Regulations <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Native Goods Loaded on Civilian Vessels Exempt From Transshipment Inspection</p>
<p>Inland River Launches in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou Exempt From Licensing</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, stating that civilian vessels Miao Songrong and Qia Shengxiang were detained by the Jianghai Customs for transporting goods. The Chamber of Commerce argued that civilian vessels transporting goods to the interior had always reported and paid taxes at the Chang Customs and Goods Donation Bureau. Since the national government had clearly ordered the abolition of levies and all Chang Customs and Goods Donation Bureaus had been abolished, there had been no official document stating that civilian vessels transporting goods should report and pay taxes to the customs. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs requesting prompt release. At the same time, twelve trade associations, including the Shanghai Sugar Industry and North Goods Industry Associations, also jointly sent letters to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that the customs' detention of civilian vessels was inappropriate, and requested the Chamber of Commerce to take charge of the matter. Subsequently, the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs replied to the Chamber of Commerce, stating that the detention of ships and goods was in accordance with the Suzhou-Hangzhou Navigation Regulations, and it was still necessary to pay transshipment tax, etc. However, the previously detained ships and goods of Miao Songrong were released with a warning. After further investigation by the Chamber of Commerce, although Articles 5 to 12 of the regulations contained provisions for civilian vessels to report to customs, register, and pay taxes according to regulations, according to the provisions of Article 1 of the regulations, these civilian vessels referred to steamships towing cargo-laden civilian vessels, not ordinary civilian vessels. Therefore, the title of the regulations was "Regulations on Chinese Steamships Traveling Between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai Carrying Passengers and Goods." The title of the regulations could determine the limits of civilian vessels. Moreover, if the customs could collect cargo taxes from civilian vessels, what taxes could levies collect before the abolition of levies? For these reasons, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance three times for clarification and legal correction. On the 30th of this month, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received Announcement No. 1266 from the Jianghai Customs, which stated: "It is hereby ordered that the 'Regulations for Trial Implementation of Trade Between Chinese and Foreign Steam Launches and Civilian Vessels Traveling Between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai,' promulgated in the 22nd year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty, be abolished immediately. Hereafter, the regulations for managing trade at the respective ports shall be handled in the same way as other commercial ports. Native goods loaded on civilian vessels shall be exempt from transshipment tax. However, goods loaded on launches or civilian vessels towed by launches shall be taxed in accordance with ordinary navigation regulations. The issuance of licenses for Chinese and foreign steam launches on the Suzhou and Hangzhou inland waterways shall be discontinued immediately. Launches traveling between Shanghai and Suzhou, Jiaxing, or Hangzhou must still report to customs upon import and export as before." Upon receiving this order, it should be complied with and notified to all shipping merchants for their information. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has notified the chambers of commerce in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai, as well as the various trade associations in Shanghai, of the progress of this matter and the results achieved through persistent efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Pudong Electric Company to Reduce Electricity Prices Starting This Month <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Pudong Electric Company has been working hard to operate its business in recent years, and its business has become increasingly prosperous. Last year, it was also rated as excellent by the Central Construction Committee and awarded a certificate of honor as encouragement. It is reported that starting this month, the price of electricity for lighting will be reduced to 20 cents per kilowatt-hour. Those who use more electricity will be given discounts according to regulations. The price of electricity will also be appropriately reduced. (1) For those whose average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower is within 150 kilowatt-hours, the price will be reduced to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour. (2) For those whose average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 150 kilowatt-hours but is within 250 kilowatt-hours, the price will be reduced to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. (3) For those whose average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 250 kilowatt-hours but is within 350 kilowatt-hours, the price will be reduced to 5.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. (4) For those whose average monthly electricity consumption per horsepower exceeds 350 kilowatt-hours, the price will be reduced to 4.6 cents per kilowatt-hour. These prices only apply to users with electric motors installed within 50 horsepower and are the same as the prices in Zhabei. Large users can still receive special discounts. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has approved the record filing and commented that the company has a broad vision and a strong sense of service.</p>
<h3 id="e91">In the Case of Road Construction Beyond the Border, the Japanese Side Insists on Maintaining Police Power in Northern Shanghai <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations Have Come to a Standstill</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the negotiations on the recovery of road construction beyond the border, although there has been progress after repeated consultations between the municipal government and the Public Concession's Public Works Department, it has ultimately come to a standstill due to the Japanese director's firm opposition. According to the Japanese side, there is no problem with returning road construction beyond the border to China, but the police power in the area where the Japanese army is stationed in northern Shanghai must always maintain the status quo. The municipal government, being ordered to recover road construction beyond the border, has always insisted on the principle of not losing sovereignty. The Public Works Department, due to the Japanese director's firm attitude, intends to postpone the discussion, so the negotiations on the recovery of road construction beyond the border will be delayed again.</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Again Requests That Water Use Remain Under the Old System <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Letter to the Secretary of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Secretary of the Public Works Department, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from the Hequn Business Co., Ltd., the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company is forcing them to install water meters, otherwise they will threaten to cut off the water. The suffering of the owner should be known to your association. Now, the oppression suffered by our company from the water company is listed below. Our company built 31 shops, No. Yuanyi Lane, at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Grant Road last spring. When they were completed in June, it was the time when the water company changed to using water meters. It was impossible to achieve the purpose of inclusive water, so we reluctantly installed them. The monthly income from rent there is only 600 yuan, but the water bill is as high as more than 120 yuan, which is already difficult to bear. Unexpectedly, in July of this year, the water bill suddenly increased to 265 yuan, more than double the previous fee. We sent a letter to the water company on August 20 to inquire about the reason for the sudden increase in the water bill. We received their reply on September 5, stating that the water pipes in the two houses, No. 2453 and No. 19 in the lane, were leaking, and that 228 gallons of water were leaking per hour, totaling 164,000 gallons of water leaking per month. Our company immediately sent a letter inviting the Hanxing Company, which originally installed the water pipes, to order craftsmen to repair them. After a detailed inspection by the craftsmen, there was no leakage in any house. At the same time, we also received the water company's August water bill for 239 yuan and 75 cents, which was the same as the previous month. Therefore, on September 20, we sent another letter to the company to question them. We then received a reply on September 24, stating that the water pipes in the two houses, No. 2469 and No. 8 in the lane, were leaking. Our company again invited the Hanxing Company to conduct a second investigation, but there were still no flaws. Of course, we suspected this. On September 30, we sent another letter to the water company to negotiate, stating that the water pipes installed by our company had been used after being inspected and qualified by the water company. How did this leakage occur, and what guarantee is there for the future leakage solution, and should the company be responsible for investigating leakage and repairing water pipes? Now that the meter system has been changed, it is not accurate to charge water fees, so that both parties have no loss, but it must not be changed. The company should have the obligation to investigate leakage, so how can users without experience in water supply engineering be required to bear the accidental losses caused by the company's management and negligence? At the same time, we also stated that the water used in the summer as reported can be calculated at a discount and should be treated the same way, and we hoped for a detailed reply. On the same day, we received a reply stating that inspecting water pipes is not the company's obligation, but in order to reduce our company's burden, after inspection, there were no errors and the rest of the questions were not answered. Later, we repeatedly sent people to negotiate verbally, and the company initially agreed to reduce the water bills for July and August, totaling 505 yuan, 38 cents, to 350 yuan. However, our company was willing to pay according to the water bills paid in the previous twelve months, calculating a total of 121 yuan, 7 cents per month, but the company did not approve it, so it has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. On the 6th of this month, another notice came, limiting the time to before the 13th of this month. If the water bills for two months are not paid in full, the water will be cut off. Our company then reluctantly paid 300 yuan for the water bill on the 20th of this month, which is about 25% more than the monthly fee, but the company actually sent a letter to return the money the next day, saying that it must reach 350 yuan, etc. Our company really can't bear it anymore. Since it concerns the interests of the public, we would rather have the water cut off than be the culprit of setting a precedent. Therefore, we send a special letter requesting that you grant a pointer and provide assistance. This is really a prayer," etc. It has come to the meeting. According to the current method of calculating water fees by meter, the purpose of preventing waste has not been achieved, and the fact that water fees have increased has been seen. Your bureau should quickly order the water company to temporarily maintain the old system before there is a proper way to prevent waste, so as to avoid the actual difficulties in handling the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Chinese Ratepayers' Association Again Requests Reconsideration of Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday sent a letter to the Secretary of the Public Works Department, stating, "Sir, according to a letter from ratepayer Lu Wenzhong, our telephone number 52845 has been subject to a price increase by the Shanghai Telephone Company. Since the Users' Association and various organizations have unanimously argued against the illegal price increase, we have followed suit and waited quietly for a solution, hoping for the final victory of all users. After learning about the payment method, we immediately signed a check on the 12th of this month and sent it by registered mail through the post office. However, the company still refused to accept it and suddenly cut off the telephone on the 19th of this month. We are being oppressed and do not want to cause trouble to our Chinese users, so we have no choice but to tell your office. The Shanghai Telephone Company's only excuse for this price increase is that it has been approved by the Public Works Department. It is natural that the price increase of a public utility company must be approved by the Public Works Department, but the company's main body of operation is tens of thousands of telephone users, and it should also consult with the users on whether they can afford it and go through the formalities of signing a new price contract before it can be done properly. If it relies on the words "approved" to raise the price and "retroactively," I don't know what country's laws this huge company is using. If it can take whatever it wants, then if the Public Works Department approves the company to raise the price retroactively to the beginning of its operation, or even stipulates an increase of one or two hundred taels of silver, will it also force users to submit? After our Chinese users unanimously opposed the price increase, the company repeatedly sent people to lobby and probe, while on the one hand using the means of cutting lines as a threat. We are concerned that once this bad precedent is set, other public utilities will follow suit in the future, and there will be no end to the exploitation of citizens. Therefore, we send a special letter to you, hoping that your association will lead users to fight for their rights." Therefore, we sent a letter to your bureau to promptly take into account the interests of both parties and reconsider the solution.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Pudong Fellow Townsmen Fight for the Municipal Ferry Price Increase <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Highest Ferry Price to Pudong is One Yuan, Members' Meeting Will Reconsider</p>
<p>The original ferry services to places such as Gaoqiao, Shanghai, were taken over and operated by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities long ago. When the fares were increased starting in January of the 21st year, members of the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association believed that the city government was competing with the people for profit, so they submitted a proposal to the first members' meeting of the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association for discussion. At that time, it was decided to petition the municipal government to cancel the price increase and design their own ferry service to benefit the common people. Later, due to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, the rescue efforts were delayed. It is now heard that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has stated that the ferry service lost 40,000 to 50,000 yuan this year and has petitioned the municipal government to increase fares again starting in January of the 22nd year. The highest fare has been increased to one yuan, and the next year it will be five jiao, which is a world apart from the original fare of only one jiao or a few fen before the municipal government took over the operation. The members of the association, based on the above reasons, have prepared a written opinion and continued to petition the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association, advocating fairness and pleading for the people. It is reported that the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association has handed over this petition to the previously organized Ferry Special Committee for discussion and will submit it to the second members' meeting on January 8 of the 22nd year for reconsideration. Because the previous efforts were unsuccessful and the fares have increased again, they will strive to achieve the goal of canceling the price increase.</p>

<p>Longsheng Rice Shop Robbed in Sudden Raid Early Morning</p>
<p>Manager Zhang Guiqing Shot While Shouting for Help - Critically Injured</p>
<p>Vegetable Vendor Old Woman Killed Instantly by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>Detectives Bravely Pursue, Arresting Many Robbers One After Another</p>
<p>Longsheng Rice Shop, located at 244 to 248 Tiantong Road, Hongkou, is managed by Zhang Guiqing, a native of Zhenhai, 45 years old. At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, just as the shop was opening its doors, eight robbers suddenly leaped in. All spoke with a Jiangbei accent. Five robbers carried handguns. After entering, the robbers saw the shop assistants and old accountant were still washing up. Taking advantage of their unpreparedness, they ordered them to gather in a corner and herded them into the rice milling warehouse, assigning one robber to guard them with a gun. The rest swarmed upstairs, directly into Zhang's bedroom on the third floor. Zhang was just getting up. Upon seeing the situation, he tried to escape, but it was too late. He was surrounded by the robbers, who demanded he hand over the keys to the safe. Zhang had no choice. The safe was opened and robbed of 500 silver dollars, 1900 paper dollars, and 1100 silver jiao (dimes). Seeing their objective achieved, the robbers rushed downstairs to escape. Zhang immediately followed, and as the robbers exited the front door, he shouted loudly, "Robbers!" At that moment, the robber guarding the rice milling warehouse was still inside. Hearing Zhang's shouts, he rushed out in a panic. Seeing Zhang still shouting, and hearing the police whistle blowing from upstairs, the robber, in desperation, ran out the front door and fired a shot at Zhang, hitting him in the chest. Zhang fell to the ground, bleeding. At that moment, nearby Chinese Constables 2992 and 3063 also heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. Seeing the robbers trying to escape, they stepped forward to apprehend them. The robbers, finding their escape route blocked, opened fire. The constables returned fire, and a fierce gunfight ensued. One of the robbers, Zhu Guangyi, was shot down and captured first. Seeing this, the remaining robbers fled in all directions. However, the Hongkou district police stations had already received the news and dispatched officers to search and capture them. Three more were apprehended. During the gunfight between the detectives and the robbers, bullets flew like rain. A vegetable vendor, the old woman Chen Li, 54 years old, happened to be passing by and was struck in a vital spot by a stray bullet, falling to the ground and dying instantly. Her body was taken to the morgue by police wagon to await examination. Zhang Guiqing and the wounded robber Zhu Guangyi were taken to Tongren Hospital. Zhang's chest wound was severe, and his life was in danger. The wounded robber was shot three times: once in each leg and once in the chest. The three robbers captured were taken to the police station under guard. Under strict interrogation, they identified themselves as Zhu Changmin, 30 years old; Huang Chuanliu Zi, 28 years old; and Liu Chunming, 38 years old, all from Jiangbei. Two handguns and several bullets were recovered. By noon, Hongkou Police Detective Wang Debiao and Detectives Bai Mingfu and Gu Changzhi had apprehended six more accomplices and recovered the stolen goods, all of whom were taken to the police station for detention.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Ancient Painting from Jing'an Temple Helps Finance the Military <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The ancient Jing'an Temple in Western Shanghai has a long history and a rich collection. Unfortunately, it was occupied by itinerant monks, and many treasures were scattered and lost. Only twelve eight-foot-long silk scroll paintings of portraits of virtuous monks from the Yuan Dynasty remain. The craftsmanship is exquisite, and the colors are magnificent. It is said that they were precious items from the Qing imperial palace, specially bestowed upon the temple's famous abbot, the Venerable Zheng Sheng. Zheng Sheng cherished these paintings as if they were priceless jewels. He would only occasionally hang them during major Buddhist festivals. Retired officials and celebrities in Shanghai who saw them were full of praise. The famous contemporary painter Mr. Wang Dun'gen added an inscription of extreme admiration. The value is unimaginable. The current abbot, Zhifa, is young and handsome and has a charitable disposition. He is particularly enthusiastic about patriotic and public welfare causes. Recently, seeing the Northeast Volunteer Army sacrificing their lives for the country, he was filled with admiration and sadness, regretting that he did not have more money to donate to the military. He decided to send these ancestral treasures to the New World Relief Association for Northeast Refugees Art Exhibition for public display, hoping that benevolent gentlemen would purchase them at a high price. He would then entrust all the proceeds to the association to be remitted to the three northeastern provinces to purchase food and military supplies. He hopes that collectors at home and abroad will be inspired to contribute their treasures, generously parting with them for sale, so that a large sum of money can be raised to provide the greatest possible assistance to the Northeast Volunteer Army. If this happens, Zhifa's grand wish will not be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Zhu Suixuan, Who Impersonated a Department Head of the China Merchants Bureau, Sentenced <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Admitted to Fraud Without Denial - Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhu Suixuan, a native of Yancheng, impersonated a member of the Executive Committee and Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Central China Merchants Bureau. He falsely set up a China Merchants Bureau company office in the pavilion room on the upper floor of 674 East Yalu Road. Under the pretext of introducing inspectors and dockworkers, he defrauded more than 20 fellow villagers, including Wang Yuejiang and Yin Zhaofeng, of several hundred yuan in "movement expenses". After the case was exposed, he was arrested by Chinese Detective Xu Yongyuan and brought before the First Special District Local Court. The details of his interrogation have already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingkun held a continued hearing in the third criminal court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer from the police station, stated that during the adjournment, it was discovered that Sun Yujie, Sun Yixuan, Zhang Lanting, Zhang Jinfa, Xiang Xiyuan, Cai Jie, Feng Yulin, and Li Jingyun, all defrauded on the pretext of introducing positions like inspectors, clerks, and workers, were swindled out of more than seventy yuan. They were present in court to testify. Based on the reports of the victims about being defrauded, the defendant admitted without denial after questioning. Judge Xu, after verifying the confession, announced the verdict in court: the defendant was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and the confiscated name cards and notices were also confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Borrowed Money Using Fictitious Person's Name <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Collateral Insufficient to Cover the Debt - Guarantors Also Sued</p>
<p>Lu Yiru, who previously worked as a translator at the former Mixed Court, in July of last year, persuaded his friend Wang Hongyuan to mortgage a large sum of money to the British firm Lianfu Real Estate Company, claiming that the paint was produced in Germany and worth 60,000 to 70,000 taels of silver. The manager of the company, a Briton named Wei Qu, saw the invoices and deeply believed him. He agreed to a mortgage of 25,000 taels of silver and signed a mortgage agreement with a deadline for redemption. However, Lu did not appear in person, but fabricated the name Wang Bofan as the mortgagor, with Sun Youqi, Sun Guozhang, the owner of a certain rice shop, and Wang Hongyuan as guarantors. The contract stipulated that the guarantors' rice shop could not close down before the mortgage was repaid. However, when the deadline arrived, the company repeatedly urged the guarantors to redeem the mortgage, but they ignored it. They then negotiated with Wang Hongyuan, who finally revealed the inside story, stating that it was entirely Lu Yiru who had initiated the matter. Wang Bofan did not exist, and the mortgaged money had been divided and used by them. They were truly unable to redeem the mortgage. The company estimated the value of the collateral to dispose of it. Unexpectedly, the estimated value was less than one-fifth of the mortgage amount. They realized they had been scammed, but still hoped to hold the guarantors accountable. When they saw that the rice shop opened by the two Suns was also empty, they hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Lu Yiru and the other three for conspiracy to defraud. Lu desperately begged someone to intercede, hoping to resolve the matter out of court, but no settlement has been reached to this day. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Junqing opened the court to summon and examine the defendants. Only Wang Hongyuan appeared in court. Lu Yiru sent lawyer Ye Shaoying to court to request an adjournment to continue trying to settle out of court. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant's so-called settlement was merely a delaying tactic, and that although the rice shop of the two guarantors had not closed, it was completely empty, posing a risk of them absconding. He requested rapid relief. Judge Zhang stated that because most of the defendants were absent, the hearing could not proceed. He only briefly questioned the plaintiff Wei Qu and the defendant Wang Hongyuan about the mortgage situation and instructed Wu to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Ningbo Native Association Cables Request for Investigation of the Old Ningbo Shatien Sub-Bureau <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai received a letter yesterday from the Fifth District Office of Yin County, stating that the Old Ningbo Shatien Sub-Bureau had arbitrarily sold the river channels in the Baisha Township area to Qia Ji for management, hindering water conservancy and causing panic among the people. They specially telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to swiftly order a halt and to dismiss and investigate Wang Weicheng, the director of the Sub-Bureau, to appease public anger. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Honored Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou: The case is based on a letter from the Fifth District Office of Yin County, stating that on the 24th of this month, they received a letter from the Deputy Township Chief Dong Xinkuan of Baisha Township, stating that the public river channels in our township are used by sailing vessels and also serve as a source of water for the residents, which is of great importance to their livelihood, and they have been dredged repeatedly over the years. However, residents along the river recently reported that the river channels along the coast, from Baisha Liangting in the east to Lianfu Temple (i.e., Zhongliangting) in the west, have been secretly sold by the Old Ningbo Shatien Sub-Bureau. Upon hearing this, we were filled with doubt and alarm. After investigation, we observed bamboo sticks inserted on both sides of the riverbank, marked with the words "Qia Ji Boundary," which confirmed the above report. According to the County Government's clear order, the sandy land along the coast of this county, which is related to water conservancy, has long been prohibited from being auctioned off. However, the Shatien Bureau acted wilfully and actually sold the public river channels privately. This not only deprives tens of thousands of residents of water but also endangers the fire safety of the entire township, which is a matter of even greater concern. Our township is located in a remote area and has been repeatedly harassed by the Sub-Bureau. The ignorant villagers obey the orders meticulously. As a result, the sandy fields along the coast that have been forcibly bought by the Bureau are numerous. Now, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, the public is panicking and does not know what the future holds. Therefore, we respectfully request your office to submit a petition to the County Government, requesting them to negotiate with the Sub-Bureau as soon as possible and issue a notice to reassure the people and emphasize water conservancy. The matter was submitted by the Fifth District Office with a resolution from the 18th District Affairs Meeting to be forwarded to the County Government, and a letter was sent to the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, etc., requesting support. After investigation, we found that the Old Ningbo Shatien Sub-Bureau violated the regulations set by the Ministry, illegally auctioned off the privately owned base lands, causing resentment in the villages. Now, they have arbitrarily disposed of the public river channels related to water conservancy, which is extremely illegal. Based on the information in the letter, we urgently request that your office review and approve it, swiftly order a halt, and dismiss and investigate the director of the Sub-Bureau to appease public anger and align with public opinion."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Charity Race Tickets Can Still Be Purchased During the New Year Holiday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that about 80% of the Universal Charity Race Lottery tickets have been sold, and there are not many remaining tickets. Because some of them had not been printed, the ticket offices were temporarily out of stock, and many could not continue to sell them. The situation of resale is generally visible. According to the Finance Bureau, all of the lottery tickets have now been printed and the required numbers have been sent to the various ticket offices yesterday in order to continue sales. However, many companies, banks, and groups in the city will be on New Year's holiday on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of the new year, and there is deep concern that ticket buyers will have no way to find out where to buy them. A mutual agreement was obtained from the Shanghai Race Club, that the club will open its doors to sell tickets on the 2nd and 3rd, but only from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm. The bureau will also assign staff to the bureau at the above times to discuss ticket purchases. The reporter also learned yesterday that many people from other places have remitted money to Shanghai to purchase the tickets from the Xinmin and Shenbao newspapers or the Municipal Finance Bureau. It is heard that only the postage fee for registered mail needs to be remitted along with the money, and the tickets can be sent, which is very convenient. Further investigation of various ticket offices such as the Xinxin and Lihua companies shows that the tickets have already been sold out, indicating the enthusiasm of ticket buyers this time. According to those familiar with horse racing, every time the number of champagne tickets is purchased to 80,000 or 90,000, because demand exceeds supply, the market price will rise by one or two yuan. This charity ticket should also have the same situation.</p>

The business has made considerable progress. The old building was not enough to apply, so two years ago, I purchased two acres of land at the corner of North Sichuan Road and Haining Road to build a seven-story building, named ［Hongkou China Bank Archives］. The building was designed by Lu Qian of the Bank's Construction Industry. Affected by Shanghai, the project was not without delay. The lowest level has been completed first, and it is scheduled to move back to work on January 4. Its architecture is extremely magnificent, and the style is the latest style. The interior architecture is all marble, and the latest European and American vaults and night vaults are used. The whole building will be completed in the future, and there will be large elevator doors and air conditioners. The second floor and above can be used as office space. According to the business of the bank, there is progress every day. At the end of the 21st year, the total number of deposits increased about seventeen times compared with the 18th year. In addition to the various deposits and loans, it also concurrently operates trust safekeeping insurance customs declaration and other businesses, in order to maximize the spirit of service.

His ignorant actions were quite ridiculous. It happened that Luo Hanxin and others, members of the second team of the Security Corps, were patrolling and passed by. They took Liu and the skull back to the team and sent them to the Third District Public Security Bureau. After the district chief questioned him, he ordered the skull to be buried first, and Liu was sent to the General Bureau for disposition.</p>
<p>Also at around 8:00 pm that night, Liu Huansheng, a patrol officer from the Third District, cracked a flower lottery listening device in a thatched house at No. 18 Dongchang Road, and arrested the device owner, Ma Liansheng from Taizhou, and suspects Wang Jianye, Ding Weiyu, and three others, along with a bunch of flower lottery paper slips, three flower lottery folds, a flower lottery book, three flower lottery charts, a bunch of blank charts, and gambling money of six yuan. They were taken to the district together. The district chief sentenced Wang and Ding to three days of detention for improper behavior, and the device owner was sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

Even if you find work, it is either the factory closing due to the influence of the current situation, or the result of production rationalization that leaves you exhausted all day without being able to eat your fill.] According to Mr. Zhu's meaning, production rationalization is the root cause of his [being exhausted all day without being able to eat his fill]. In fact, this is not the case. We know that the content of production rationalization is nothing more than: (1) organizing the factory with extremely scientific methods, simplifying the relationship between departments, and saving as much as possible in terms of materials and time, or producing more products in the same amount of time and with the same amount of materials; (2) making every effort to innovate machinery so that the products that formerly required the labor of ten or hundreds of people can now be produced with the labor of only one or ten people; (3) universally electrifying factories, so that machines that formerly required ten or hundreds of people to manage now only require one or ten people; (4) transportation and traffic are all under the control of electrification and mechanization, so that the transportation of products and materials is extraordinarily rapid and saves a great deal of labor and time. Rationalization itself is not sinful; the sin lies in the private system of production for the sake of commodities. Implementing production rationalization in a private production society, its purpose is only to increase the production of commodities; to intensify the exploitation of labor; to save production methods as much as possible; and to dissolve accumulated capital as much as possible. The result is only overproduction, factory closures, which forms the so-called [population surplus] and worker unemployment. However, this does not mean that production rationalization will have this phenomenon as soon as it is implemented in the current society, but rather that when it develops to a certain extent, it will inevitably lead to a greater economic panic. We can understand this by looking at the results of production rationalization in the United States and Germany. However, we can draw an opposite conclusion from production rationalization in the existing private production society, which is: in a higher, new social relationship of production, this kind of production rationalization is 100% necessary, and it is a necessary condition; therefore, the first necessary condition for production rationalization at a higher level is: shortening working hours. Why shorten working hours? In order to increase the cultural level of workers, so that they can spend most of their time enjoying spiritual happiness and higher education, because in this society, production is no longer for the production of commodities, but for the consumption of the producers themselves; the planned economy of the Soviet Union also reveals this clue. I am afraid that Mr. Zhu, because he curses the production rationalization of the current society and also hates and opposes the production rationalization of the rational society of the future, would be greatly dangerous. I would like to ask Mr. Zhu with a word and ask your reporter for advice. Is there any merit in this? I hope you can enlighten me.</p>
<p>Reply: Your letter expresses the essence of production rationalization with great insight, which can greatly supplement what Mr. Zhu has not expressed. Mr. Zhu is suffering from illness and deeply affected by the exploitation of the capitalists. He is feeling sentimental for a moment, [illegible] calm and precise analysis. Mr. Zhu should also agree with what you said. However, I would like to add one point here, which is that production rationalization is the highest manifestation of the production method of a commodity production society, but this highest production method becomes incompatible with the production relations from which it came to a certain extent. As a result, it digs a grave for the social organization formed by this production relationship. [Please come in], and breaks out of its womb, becoming the [darling] of a higher stage of social organization. What do you think of this high-level insight?</p>
<h3 id="e123">(2) The [Starvation] Problem <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Sun Jingren丨</p>
<p>Your reporter said in response to Mr. [Blank]'s reply on the 19th of this month: [As long as you endure hardship, you will never starve to death.] I am somewhat skeptical about this statement. If we are to encourage people to work hard and not sit idle and eat, then saying this may have a one-sided reason, and the good intentions of the speaker can be reasonably excused. However, in the current society, this statement is really not enough to be a lesson, because most of the people who have already starved to death, or are about to starve to death, or will inevitably starve to death in the future, are willing to [endure hardship] and really endure hardship], while those who live in luxury, ride tall horses and drive fancy cars, and indulge in extravagance and dissipation are mostly people who cannot endure hardship, are unwilling to endure hardship, and specialize in using the [hardship] of others to supply his sacrifices. Take me as an example. From morning to night, I work more than twelve hours in the store, both managing the accounts for the owner and running errands for him; both wiping the tables and sweeping the floor, and doing business for him. Except for eating and sleeping, there is not a moment of free time all day long. However, I only earn twenty yuan a month, and apart from my food, clothing, and shelter, there is nothing left to support my mother. If I want to support my mother, I have to go hungry. But I am still lucky to have twenty yuan a month. There are hundreds of thousands of others in Shanghai who are willing to endure hardship and are able to endure hardship, but cannot find work anywhere. Since they have no work, the daring ones have to become thieves and kidnappers, and the weak ones have to commit suicide by throwing themselves into the Huangpu River. So, I think this way: those who starve to death are not necessarily people who are unwilling to endure hardship or unable to endure hardship; and those who do not starve to death are not necessarily all people who are willing to endure hardship or able to endure hardship. Quite the contrary. And further observation: the current society is, on the one hand, making every effort to create [hardship] for people, and on the other hand, making every effort to create opportunities for people to be unwilling to endure hardship and [live in ease and comfort]. Is this correct? I humbly ask for your clear understanding.</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: Regarding our reply to Mr. Weng's question about economic difficulties [annual income of more than 200 yuan, a family of six or seven, debts of more than 3,000 yuan, and the end of the year is approaching, how to cope?] (Mr. Weng's original letter and our reply can be found in this column on the 19th of this month), we have received two letters from Mr. Zhu Ying before and after, having detailed discussions with us. (See this column on the 22nd and 27th) Mr. Zhu's intention is that we should not vaguely tell Mr. Weng that this is a whole social problem, but simply vaguely call him to [endure hardship]. Regarding this point, we have already explained it in our two replies to Mr. Zhu, that is, we have already explained in our reply to Mr. Weng that this is a whole social problem, but the wording is slightly vague. Now we have received another letter from Mr. Sun, continuing to correct our words about calling Mr. Weng to [endure hardship]. Although Mr. Sun's opinion has already been expressed by Mr. Zhu, the wording is even more painful than that of Mr. Zhu. Apart from accepting Mr. Sun's instructions with the utmost sincerity, we have nothing else to say. Here, on the one hand, we hope that all people who have suffered greatly but cannot eat their fill, or who are willing to endure hardship but have no hardship to endure, can have a thorough awakening and ask why most people suffer greatly but cannot eat their fill, or are willing to endure hardship but have no hardship to endure? Why do a few people not suffer at all and get [peace, wealth, and honor]? For our heavy responsibilities, we can all have a very clear understanding! At the same time, since Mr. Sun has such a clear understanding of our current serious problems, and is willing to discuss them with us in detail without being bothered, we hope that Mr. Sun will be able to provide us with more advice in the future.</p>

<p>(2) Teaching Method Key Points</p>
<p>Regarding high school physical education teaching methods, in addition to the principles of junior high school, attention should be paid to the training of leaders, in order to lead social sports after leaving school. The key points of the teaching method are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Apply as much as possible all the learning methods and analytical learning methods of ordinary teaching methods, and the law of preparation, the law of exercise, and the law of effect of educational psychology.</p>
<p>(2) Regular class, morning exercises, and extracurricular sports should be mutually linked to avoid repetition, so as to avoid student fatigue.</p>
<p>1. In regular class, various sports focus on basic training and teaching of methods and rules. The teacher's work is heavier.</p>
<p>2. Extracurricular sports focus on students' actual practice. At this time, the teacher is only responsible for management.</p>
<p>3. Morning exercises or inter-class activities focus on gentle physical activities. Their role is to regulate life, and natural activities are the main focus.</p>
<p>(3) Use group competition methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Hold at least one skill test each semester. At the beginning of the semester, announce the test methods in advance to encourage students to practice hard at ordinary times.</p>
<p>(5) National arts should start with physical training, the posture should be correct, the movements should be lively, and the meaning and function of each movement should be clear.</p>
<p>(6) Schools without indoor physical education facilities should make full use of ordinary indoor facilities for special physical education activities.</p>
<p>(7) Sanitary facilities, such as bathrooms, should be fully provided.</p>
<p>(8) According to the environment of each school, formulate standards for skills, health, and common knowledge.</p>
<p>(9) Use holidays to create large group physical design activities, such as celebrations and joint sports meetings.</p>
<p>(10) Unite with other groups in sports to compare and promote progress.</p>
<p>(11) Conduct health examinations of all students three weeks after the start of each year.</p>
<p>(12) Use ability grouping methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Physical education grading cannot be based on ordinary intelligence standards, because the ages of students in different regions are uneven, and the degree of physical development is different. Students of the same grade may not be suitable for the same type of teaching material. Therefore, within the possible range, ability grading methods should be used as much as possible. The grading methods should be based on the following six standards (see appendix).</p>
<p>Fifth, Appendix Grading Methods</p>
<p>(1) Gender, (2) Results of physical examination, (3) Age, height, weight, (4) Physical fitness, (5) Skills, (6) Grade level. The following is a brief explanation of these six grading methods:</p>
<p>(1) Gender After the ages of twelve and thirteen, the development of boys and girls gradually becomes different, and their interests also differ. Therefore, physical education in the ordinary science of high school should be completely separated into classes.</p>
<p>(2) Results of health examination Health examination is one of the most important events in school administration. At least one student should be examined once a year. The results of the examination should be used as a reference for physical education grading. Students with poor physical development or defects should be given special instruction.</p>
<p>(3) Age, height, weight It is extremely difficult to teach students of uneven ages and different development together in physical education class. Many schools use the age, height, and weight grading methods. Some use only one, some use two in combination, and some use all three in combination, and the combination of all three is the best. McCloy's Physical Ability Standards Score Table can be used. A simple method is attached below for application. It can still be changed when used. For example, the table is divided into seven grades. When applying it, it can be divided into two or three grades according to the index obtained by actual high school students.</p>

<p>(10) The Only Method for National Construction [Corvée Labor]</p>
<p>After the implementation of educational construction, material construction is, of course, also extremely important. However, material construction requires a great deal of manpower. To expedite its realization within a few periods, it is necessary to implement universal corvée labor. Corvée labor should be divided into two types: military corvée labor and agricultural corvée labor.</p>
<p>Our country currently has more than two million soldiers, and uses 80% of the national income each year to support the troops. This is currently a major enemy that consumes national strength and hinders construction. I believe that the ancient-style national defense method of "raising troops for a thousand days to use them for one morning" is extremely uneconomical and that soldiers who are well-fed and have nothing to do are prone to misconduct. Rather than using the method of streamlining troops to reduce military expenditures, it is better to implement military corvée labor, which is relatively beneficial and easier to manage. In accordance with the policy of national construction, under the guidance of experts from the association, the military leaders of each province and region are responsible for completing the most important profit-generating projects and productive enterprises during this ten-year national salvation period. These include projects such as railways, highways, bridges, canals, dikes, and docks, as well as enterprises such as power generation, afforestation, mining, and heavy industry manufacturing. A small portion of the national army will be retained to undertake national defense, while the majority of the military will devote their efforts to construction. The results will be: (1) internal wars can be eliminated, (2) military expenditures can be reduced, (3) construction can be implemented, and (4) all soldiers in the country can fulfill some of their national salvation obligations.</p>
<p>The construction work of military corvée labor is a major undertaking that is tightly integrated, and it is a construction of a special kind of enterprise. It requires continuous work over ten years. The work of agricultural corvée labor is to be dispersed among the villages throughout the country, with farmers in each village taking on the affairs of their respective villages. Every year during the slack farming season in winter, agricultural corvée labor will be implemented under government orders, association guidance, and teacher supervision. The first phase is to organize village roads and open up village paths. The second phase is to open rivers, plant trees, relocate graves, and eliminate pests. The third phase is to construct public places and houses in the village. However, it is best to implement agricultural corvée labor two or three years after the implementation of educational labor, because by that time, the farmers throughout the country will have been enlightened and influenced by teachers, and at least will have gained some common knowledge as citizens. Or at least a portion of the farmers can be expected to participate voluntarily.</p>
<p>As for the grassroots organization of farmers, the county magistrates of each county throughout the country should be responsible, together with the district chiefs of each autonomous region, to jointly organize Education for National Salvation Advancement Associations in each village. Then, the government should issue an order, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>[Within three months, the county magistrates of each county throughout the country should assist university and middle school students in organizing Education for National Salvation Associations in each county. Then, within six months, the county magistrates should convene the district chiefs of each autonomous region to organize Education for National Salvation Advancement Associations in each district to assist university and middle school students in establishing schools and encouraging farmers' children to attend school.]</p>
<p>(11) The Only Method for Defending the Nation [Military Service]</p>
<p>We can never abandon the fertile soil and the climate suitable for farming and animal husbandry that Heaven has given us. We can never abandon the vast land and numerous people that our ancestors have passed down to us. We can never allow Japan or any European or American country to become our master. We never want to kill people, but we will not allow others to kill us. We never want to seize other people's land, but we will not allow others to seize our land. We not only want to achieve equality between people, but also equality between countries. However, if we want to fulfill the above conditions, we cannot succeed without a great and well-organized military force. Therefore, we must implement military service in order to make the country independent and survive. However, the qualifications of the new soldiers of this 20th century must include education, scientific knowledge, military training, and moral cultivation. None of these four can be lacking. Therefore, I advocate that the period for implementing this military service should be at least five or six years after the implementation of educational service, because by that time, there will be at least millions of people who are qualified to become educated new soldiers, and tens of thousands of people who are qualified to become trained new military officers.</p>
<p>Therefore, our first step is national salvation, our second step is national construction, and our third step is national defense. Because the current military requires four elements: soldiers, generals, materials, and morale. In other words, it is a military that has undergone sufficient military training and is willing to give its life, generals and staff with overall talents who have experienced major battles, and leaders in various affairs, and the completeness of all kinds of combat equipment, military supplies, chemical materials, electrical appliances, and transportation facilities, and a great unified popular sentiment, which can be responsible for replenishing the military and materials. Therefore, in wartime, people can be seen diligently serving the public, and factories are manufacturing goods day and night. Therefore, the current scientific military movement requires at least ten years of full preparation from top to bottom, and it must be after production, manufacturing, education, and military administration are complete before it can deal with enemy countries that are scientifically advanced and have substantial military strength. Therefore, I extremely support the current government's policy of temporary submission to seek a way out, which is to preserve strength to seek final victory. This is why I advocate that military service should be implemented in five or six years. Because acting on emotions is useless.</p>

<p>Executive Committee Member Kong Minzhong Issues Statement</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Library Association held its seventh annual meeting on December 18th, it has elected Du Dingyou, Kong Minzhong, and nine others as executive committee members. It has been learned that Du Dingyou and others recently submitted their resignations. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specifically went to Mr. Kong Minzhong, the executive committee member responsible for convening this annual meeting, to obtain his statement. He said, "This meeting was convened by me (Kong). After returning south from the north, I had not been involved in library work for a long time. The association invited me to join, and I felt that Shanghai is the cultural center of the country, and it is necessary to promote modern library work in Shanghai. Therefore, I contacted various parties to hold this annual meeting. On December 22nd, we held a meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the Jiaotong University Library. Committee members Huang Weilian, Ma Chonggan, and I arrived on time. Many resolutions were made. Unexpectedly, the Jiaotong University authorities and the absent committee members misunderstood, leading to Mr. Du's resignation. However, all the committee members disagreed with Mr. Du's actions, and those who misunderstood no longer misunderstand. Therefore, Mr. Du's resignation should be firmly rejected, so that this pure academic field will not be stained with mud or die young. When the fertilizer is added, a fresh flower will bloom. Is there anything wrong with everyone looking at it and smelling it?"</p>

<p>Southeast Wins Over Girls' Middle School, Liangjiang Wins Over High School Girls</p>
<p>The Liangjiang and Southeast women's basketball teams held two friendly matches in Hangzhou yesterday: (1) Southeast won 35-5 over Zhejiang Provincial Girls' Middle School, held at the Girls' Middle School. (2) Liangjiang won 61-13 over the Zhejiang High School Girls' Division.</p>
<p>Southeast Wins Over Girls' Middle School - Thirty-Five to Five -</p>
<p>The Girls' Middle School is the Hangzhou championship team, and their skills are deeply cultivated. However, due to their young age and short stature, they cannot penetrate under the Southeast basket. The guards are also difficult to defend against the long-time veterans of Southeast. The game started at 10:00 AM, Chen Bingde was the referee. In the first quarter, Southeast scored 15 points, 25 points in the first half. The Girls' Middle School had not yet scored. Starting in the second half, Southeast supplemented with reserves. Shen Wanzhen scored a wonderful two points in the third quarter. Zhang Zhuhua scored another three points in the fourth quarter, 35-5, Southeast won. Although the Girls' Middle School lost, they fought hard throughout, and their spirit was very good. Later, the Girls' Middle School served refreshments. There were several veterans from Donghua and Jinan cheering in the stands, so it felt even more colorful.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Wins Over High School - Sixty-One to Thirteen -</p>
<p>Liangjiang faced a group from the High School Girls' Division. The game was at 11:00 AM at the provincial sports field. The high school seemed to be better than the Girls' Middle School in strength, and the physique was also taller. They tried their best to resist when they entered the court, and they still looked nervous. The high school repeatedly used wonderful coordination to enter under the Liangjiang basket, but they were not accurate in shooting, lost many good opportunities. Liangjiang was very surprised, and busy dealing with it. The result of the first half was 20-6, Liangjiang won. In the second half, the high school's energy gradually decreased. Their long-range shots in front of the basket were also small, unable to score. The momentum of Liangjiang became more and more prosperous. As a result, it was 61-20. The high school's skills were very good, but the physical strength was poor. Also, the cold weather had an impact on outdoor games.</p>

<p>Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Yuyu, Ge Jinwen, and Xie Xingdao Arrive Together First</p>
<p>Score 57 minutes and 30 seconds</p>
<p>Hangzhou, December 31st (Telegraph) Today's race walking performance did not start until 1:45 PM. The Shanghai team did not arrive, so the Hangzhou athletes started first. The crowd along the way was even larger. Shi, Zeng, Ge, and Xie maintained a parallel line throughout, at the forefront. Starting from the entrance of the sports field, they circled the city to the original place, a total of 11,000 meters. Shi and others were always at the forefront, performing the posture. There were a total of 24 people. Passing through the downtown area, the crowd was very interested. However, the order was not good. When they returned to the gate of the sports field, Shi and the other four entered. Those without tickets rushed in, and the military police had to suppress them. The gate of the sports field was closed. The score for the first race walking was 57 minutes and 30 seconds. Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Yuyu, Ge Jinwen, and Xie Xingdao arrived at the same time.

<h3 id="e151">暨南 Holds Southern Championship for Sixth Year <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's 2-2 Draw with Jiaotong University Means an Average of One More Point Keeps the Championship Ticket</p>
<p>—Auntie Wind Plays Tricks, Athletes from Both Teams Struggle to Show Their Strengths—</p>
<p>In recent years, the Southern University Football Championship has been a contest solely between Jinan and Jiaotong Universities. This year is no different. The final was held yesterday at Jinan University in Zhenru. At the time, there was no sun, and the north wind blew fiercely. Nearly a thousand spectators surrounded the field. In the end, the score was 2-2, a draw. Jinan University continued to hold the championship for the sixth year with one more point, truly worthy of being called lucky.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Jinan Holds for Six Years <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Southern University Football Tournament has now reached its seventh session. Jinan University has uniquely held it six times, no less than a fine tale in the history of football. And the changes in talent in the university football world can be roughly seen here. In the first session, Fudan showed great strength and dominated the South. In the second session, the football match was eventful, forming a triangle, with Jiaotong, Guanghua, and Jinan each occupying one side, sharing the championship equally. Since then, Jinan has seen frequent rises in talent, and its reputation has greatly increased. The only strong opponent is Jiaotong University. Therefore, the final has always been between the above two teams. In the third session, Jinan won 7-1; in the fourth, 2-1; in the fifth, 9-0; and in the sixth, 10-0. Jinan held the championship for five years. By the time of this seventh session, Jinan's famous players Chen Zhenhe, Jiang Shan Jing Zhuang, Shihong Mei Hongbao, and others were unable to play, and the combat strength was weakened. Jiaotong University, having been defeated repeatedly, had long resolved to avenge its humiliation. The opportunity to restore its glory suddenly came. Therefore, they put all their efforts into maneuvering. In yesterday's battle, each team won two goals, maintaining a draw. Jiaotong University ultimately lost the chance to fight again due to a 0-0 draw with Fudan in a previous match, resulting in an average of one less point. This year's championship belongs to Jinan again. Jiaotong University has not lost in this session, but in the end, it still returns with a runner-up title, which is also worth lamenting.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Referees Demand Protection <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Since the assault case on referee Chen Jixiang, the Referee Association has generally refused all football matches within the scope of the Southern University. However, yesterday's Southern University final between Jiaotong and Jinan was still refereed by Jiang Xiangqing, a member of the association, which is puzzling. According to Mr. Jiang, the school authorities asked him to reluctantly do his best in a private capacity, and he will directly report to the Referee Association in the future and ask for punishment, and he is willing to donate all the referee transportation fees earned in one season as a fine. Furthermore, Mr. Jiang requested that both parties provide written safety guarantees before he would agree to enter the field to perform his duties to avoid accidental dangers. After the formalities were completed, the battle began, already fifteen minutes past the scheduled time.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Great Battle Results in a Draw <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Auntie Wind Teases the Balls. On the day of the great battle, Auntie Wind graced the scene, teasing the balls, making them unpredictable. The athletes from both teams were flustered. It is truly as they say, "Those who comply will live, and those who resist will die." Jinan took the lead with a score of 2-1 in the first half. Jiaotong also achieved a draw in the second half because of this. Moreover, balls that could often have been scored passed by the goal. What was unexpected turned into reality. This is all because Auntie Wind was playing tricks. No excellent passes or beautiful shots were seen, presumably also due to being trapped under the influence of Auntie Wind, unable to display their skills.</p>
<p>Li Chuanxin Wins the Lottery. The whistle blew, and the great battle began. Jinan attacked with the wind, relentlessly striking. Jiaotong's Zhang Ji Zeng and Chen Gongyu defended on the left and right, while Yang Yuhua, Zhang Jinrong, and Li Beiliang intercepted in the middle, causing Jinan's five forwards to be unable to enter. Suddenly, Luo Haiguang took a long shot. Fan Jiaju moved forward to receive it. Wang Nanzhen galloped to intercept. Fan kicked it out, hitting Wang's back, bouncing back towards the goal. The whole field was shocked. Unexpectedly, it was carried past the empty goal by Auntie Wind, rushing toward the direction. Jiaotong's goalie, He, praised it. The forwards immediately looked壮. Wan Xianghua took the lead, breaking through three barriers in a row. Shen Guanlan followed closely, passing the ball to the center. Xie, the goalkeeper, left his post to save the danger, leaving the goal wide open. Li Chuanxin arrived next, making a successful shot. Jiaotong opened the scoring first.</p>
<p>Wang Nanzhen Makes a Miraculous Contribution. Jinan's athletes, suffering this unexpected loss, were greatly enraged. The entire army devoted themselves, with no turning back. Liu Zukan's shot was missed by Fan, failing to pass through the gate. Zhang Hongzao lay down on the left side. When the time came, he quickly passed to the center. How strange! It repeatedly collided with Jiaotong's inner guard and the goalkeeper's legs, and finally bounced into the net from the goalpost, making it a draw. Jinan's momentum greatly increased, pressing relentlessly. Luo Haiguang shot towards the goal, hitting the post and bouncing back. During the struggle for possession, Wang Nanzhen, seeing that no one was prepared, secretly fired a cold arrow. Where the sound of the string started, it went deep into the net. Not long after, Jinan scored another goal, but it was ruled out due to Chen Zhenxiang's offside. At that time, the goalkeeper Fan was the target of public criticism, but he was able to defuse the danger, which was praised by the audience.</p>
<p>Shen Guanlan Sets the Draw. After the break, the war drums sounded again. Jiaotong turned from a disadvantage to taking advantage of the wind, and the atmosphere changed. Attacking was more common than defending. Jinan knew this and heavily guarded. As they held each other for five minutes, Wan Xianghua suddenly rose as a surprise soldier. Mai Tinglin was unable to stop him. Lai Zuorong rushed to help. Wan quickly passed to the center. At that time, the goalkeeper Xie was loyal and unwilling to submit, personally coming out to save the situation, leaving the goal empty. Shen Guanlan's leg rose, the ball went out, directly into the goal, again forming a 2-2 draw. At this critical moment, both sides worked hard and fought fiercely, forming a stalemate. After thirty minutes, Jinan got a free kick, the location was within the penalty area. Each side arranged their formations, competing with each other's intelligence. In the end, it was ineffective. Until the sound of the retreat signal, it was still a 2-2 draw. In total, in each game, Jinan had one more point (9 compared to 8), maintaining the sixth-year championship.</p>

<h3 id="e158">A Murder on the Winter Solstice Morning <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Confucius said that the upper class kills with the pen, the middle class kills with words, and the lower class kills with stone slabs. It can be seen that there are many ways to kill. I just met a guest, and because he was too good at talking, I killed him with two and a half sentences. Although whether he lives or dies is up to him, whether I kill him is up to me, fulfilling my duty as a middle class person.</p>
<p>The matter is like this. Although I don't believe in Jesus, I observe Christmas, which is commonly known as the foreign Winter Solstice. In the past few days, because Christmas is coming, I have been extra busy, buying things I shouldn't buy, playing with the children more, and during this festive season, I seem to feel that I should be particularly lazy. Therefore, the manuscript for the China Critic [Small Critic] has not been written. The person who collects the manuscript wants it within twenty minutes. Originally, I am very systematic in handling affairs, but at this time, I want to be unsystematic for once. I think that if a person does things properly all year round, it's nothing to mess up during this festive season, right? Even if the China Critic cannot be published on schedule, China will not perish because of it, right? So, I am sitting by an iron stove, dreaming of the pleasure of watching the fire in a fireplace, temporarily putting all the worries in my heart into the dream fire, turning them into nothing, and flying up to the blue sky. Only because I am naturally well-behaved, even though I am sitting and dreaming, I still glance at that typewriter from time to time. As a result, I understand the big picture, and my desire to be lazy is overcome. I make up my mind and am preparing to work.</p>
<p>Just as I was rushing to write the manuscript, knowing that there was an article to write, but not knowing how to start, the doorbell suddenly rang. Looking at the card, it was a stranger. This made me embarrassed, because if it was a familiar guest, I could wish him a Merry Christmas and then ask him to get lost. However, the situation of the visitor seemed very important. So, I asked the servant to tell the visitor first that I was very busy at the moment, but if there was anything important, he could come in and sit and talk for a few minutes. He said that the matter was very urgent. So, he came in.</p>
<p>This gentleman was very well-dressed and behaved very elegantly. In fact, looking at his name card printed in a Song Dynasty style, one would know that he was a member of the academic community. His forehead was very high, very much like a literary scholar. But his mouth was pointed and small, and his eyes were narrow, which didn't make people like him very much. He was holding a paper bag in his hand. I was already ill-disposed towards him.</p>
<p>So, we began to exchange greetings. Mr. So-and-so had long admired my [great name] and had also read my [great works].</p>
<p>[Very shallow. Please don't laugh, sir.] I replied respectfully as usual. But as soon as these words came out, I immediately felt bad. I had a feeling that we would have to pay our respects to each other for another fifteen minutes, going around in circles, before there was any hope of getting to the point. I didn't know what his business was after all.</p>
<p>To be honest, I have a lot of experience in receiving guests. Generally, the more knowledgeable and polite the visitor is, the more greetings and roundabout words there are. Everyone knows that it is not good to be impolite when meeting a stranger, like a foreigner saying "I'm here for such and such a matter" and opening the topic directly, because this way of opening the topic is not elegant. When scholars meet for the first time, they must have the identity of a scholar, taking out the effort of writing eight-legged essays or the righteous method of the Tongcheng School. When talking like this, it is called having articles in the words. Articles should not only have style but also have structure. It can probably be divided into four paragraphs. However, talking is not like writing an article, starting with breaking the topic and carrying on the topic; the words to enter the topic should be left to the end. These four paragraphs are like this: (1) talk about greetings, comment on the climate, (2) describe the past, pursue old friendships, (3) talk about current affairs, express emotions, (4) the [small matter] to be entrusted. No scholar is willing to start from the fourth paragraph. They must use the chapters, with foreshadowing, carrying on, and the momentum is strong, and then suddenly stop, stopping abruptly under the virtue of reality. If these four paragraphs are classified using the book classification method, they can also be divided into (1) meteorology, (2) history, (3) politics, (4) economics. The role of the first paragraph is to [sit in hiding], in line with the meaning of "when they come, be at peace with them." [Your surname] [your given name] [I have long admired you] [I have long been away from you] and [the weather today haha] belong to this paragraph. Only when the position is secure can the feelings be settled. The so-called settling feelings does not refer to the evening of settling feelings but is only for connecting feelings. Therefore, the second paragraph is about describing the old. Maybe your nephew went to school with Mr. So-and-so, maybe you lived on South Small Street, and he lived in No Amount of Adult Hutong. Thus, feelings are blended together. If everyone is from Peking University, knows Zhimo, Shizhi, or even Gu Hongming, Lin Qin'nan..., then it will be even more intimate and talkative. When feelings are good and the momentum is strong, the next step is to talk about current affairs and express emotions. This third paragraph has a wide range, including: it is unreasonable for China not to perish, national salvation policies, and comments on the political leaders of Guyue Sanwang Caojiang Ma Er Gongchang, and so on. There are also statistics on following President Sun for how many years. For example, if you heard President Sun give a speech once in the thirty-first year of Guangxu, and this year is the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the total should be twenty-five years. This is called following President Sun for twenty-five years. When feelings are good and the momentum is strong, the time to start suddenly has come. So, the guest drinks tea and stands up, picks up his hat, and suddenly turns into the fourth paragraph: There is a small matter to ask of you now. Sir, do you know the principal of ○○ University? Could you please write a letter of introduction? Summarize the whole article.</p>
<p>On this Winter Solstice morning, my nerves are sensitive, and I know that I am going to listen to an article with the four-paragraph method again. Because Mr. So-and-so's speech is very elegant and his behavior is very dignified, I am a little prepared. In my heart, I am guessing what treasures are in his paper bag. Or is he going to introduce me to some errand? Even so, we still start with meteorology.</p>
<p>The zodiac signs have been calculated, and Mr. So-and-so casually mentions Fu Junlai. Fu Junlai is a top student at Peking University. I understand that he is describing the old, already in the second paragraph. Yes, this gentleman is indeed talented, with a light of ten thousand feet in his chest and a very strong pen. I completely agree, but my eyes always shoot back on the typewriter and his paper bag. However, without knowing it, our feelings have indeed blended together. What this gentleman talks about is reasonable and pertinent.</p>
<p>The transition from the second paragraph to the third paragraph is very natural.</p>
<p>Fu Jun, a native of Shu. You see, isn't there a fratricidal killing in Sichuan? Mr. So-and-so said Sichuan is very unfortunate. He said he saw the Analects Biweekly (I heard people say they saw the Analects Biweekly. I'm always happy.) and knew that there had been four hundred and seventy-seven civil wars in Sichuan since the Republic of China. I naturally have no objection, but I think in my heart: [Chinese people have too much time.] The China Critic's servant is coming to pick up the manuscript, so I am not willing to listen to his arguments anymore, appreciate his chapters, but am very willing to help him end the third paragraph. We have been talking for more than half an hour. At this time, I feel that it wouldn't hurt to hang all the Sichuan warlords and move on to the main topic.</p>
<p>[Sir, what is your business in visiting today?]</p>
<p>[Just a small matter,] he said, opening his paper bag. [I heard that you and Mr. Hu, the editor of a certain magazine, are relatives. Could I trouble you to forward this manuscript to Mr. Hu?]</p>
<p>[Mr. Hu and I are not relatives, and I have never heard of the name of that magazine,] I replied wildly against my will, feeling that I had the outline of a middle-class person killing someone. At this time, the plot is very tense. Because of this sudden attack, not only was it beyond my own expectations, but even this gentleman was stunned. We both felt dumbfounded, because we deeply regretted that such a good article, which took half a point to do the groundwork and just wanted to enter the topic, was made to have no ending because of my madness. My sin is really no less than that of who kicked over the seven-star lamp. At this time, we both felt that life is like a dream! Because I know that I have wasted my most precious Winter Solstice morning in vain, and he also feels that he has wasted his knowledge of meteorology, astronomy, history, and politics in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e159">New Year's Office Closure for Three Days <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Shengtao</p>
<p>The three-day New Year's office closure has been approved, and it is also said that "a notice is sent to the whole country to handle it uniformly." All service gentlemen are certain to have three days of "playing around."</p>
<p>Some time ago, it was reported in the newspaper that all New Year celebrations and other activities would be免除ed, the reason being that we are still in a time of national crisis. It seems that there was also a proposal to continue working as usual during the New Year. If you ask why, even a primary school student can answer, nothing more than "national crisis is pressing" and "work is tight." This is consistent with the practice of eating vegetarian food for one day on National Humiliation Day, which, in short, is [lying on firewood and tasting gall].</p>
<p>Suffering hardships, facing each other with sad faces, is the norm of human nature. However, a sad face must coexist with resolute implementation and sincere hope to have meaning. If there is nothing else besides a sad face, then you can only be sad for the rest of your life. Even if you are sad to death, who will pay attention to you?</p>
<p>Speaking of work, it is usually said that progress is good, and stagnation is not good. For example, a carpenter, if he stops working for a day, he will make two fewer chairs. If he doesn't stop, he will make two more chairs. Work stagnation reduces efficiency, so it is not good. However, it cannot be generalized. Some work has almost no efficiency. It is always in progress there. There is nothing good about it. Even if it stagnates for a lifetime, there is nothing wrong with it. Let's take an example, the so-called [office work] of [waiting for instructions and then following them] is such.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Wang Yinchuan's [A History of the Successful Struggle of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan]. The book records what a middle-aged woman said to the author: [In the past, although our lives were comfortable, it was only for our minority. The majority of people were much worse than our current situation. Now, although our minority is not as good as before, the majority of people are better than before. This is also how justice should be....</p>
<p>What's more, government personnel sell our saved materials to foreign countries, exchange them for cash, buy machinery, and build these many factories, railways, houses, etc. We can see it with our own eyes. Although our current life is not very satisfactory, although it is difficult, we have hope. It is not very satisfactory, but it is rich in difficulty, and the whole country has the same unsatisfactory and difficulty.]</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>When saying this, that woman was probably also showing a sad face. Think about it, what kind of strength and heart coexist with her sad face? The five-year plan was completed in four years, which is the overall expression of efficiency. In such a huge project, of course, no one can be lazy. If there is nothing else besides a sad face, it is better to pursue joy and seek laughter. This is ultimately beneficial to health. Anyway, progress and stagnation are like two fives and ten, what does it matter if you stop for a while? Therefore, the method of issuing a notice to the whole country to stop working for three days during the New Year is worthy of our praise.</p>

<h3 id="e160">［There is No Moon on New Year's Eve Every Year］ <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for five years. The customs of greeting, kowtowing, and saying auspicious words to celebrate New Year's Day in my hometown have long been increasingly blurred in my memory. Only the saying [There is no moon on New Year's Eve every year] is still deeply engraved in my mind, and the more I think about it, the more I learn that it is [very meaningful.]</p>
<p>Originally, it is indeed a disappointing thing that there is no moon on New Year's Eve. If it is [New Year's Eve] and [there is a moon], then when people [gather with their families and drink to their heart's content], looking up at the bright moon in the sky, everyone bathing in the silver [light], there is no need to set off firecrackers to break the silence, nor is there a need to hold torches to illuminate the darkness. This can even make people add some [joy] to the [happiness]! However, in my experience, the past twenty-seven New Year's Eves have all been without a moon, and each time it has been a dark, deathly night.</p>
<p>Probably because everyone is unwilling to have no moon on New Year's Eve, a [revolution] was launched vigorously not long ago. This revolution 革ed the [lunar calendar] to use the [solar calendar], dragging New Year's Eve out from under the fate of the [obscure] character. The revolution then [succeeded], and everyone was happy, thinking that from now on there would be a moon on New Year's Eve, even if there was no bright moon, at least it should not be [pitch black.] But hope finally deceived us. This year's New Year's Eve is still as [dark] as in previous years, and the darkness is mixed with rain, making people shiver!</p>
<p>I don't remember which British or American person said this: [Since 1929, we have never had a Merry Christmas], but, God knows, we are even worse. Since we were born, we have never had a New Year's Eve with a moon!</p>
<p>Let's get to work and transform this dark world. This way, maybe we can finally have a [New Year's Eve with a moon]!</p>
<h3 id="e161">Mr. Lao She's Letter Says: <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Liewen:</p>
<p>You asked me for short essays; to be honest, I'm not good at them. Please look this way. I have a private matter to say: I'm skilled at both grand and medium-sized writings -- it seems unnecessary to say the latter part. If you don't believe me, ask Aunt Ma; am I not a literary master of grand writings? However, you insist on making things difficult for me, and I have my own ideas. You see, I only need to slide down from the grand style to become a medium style; then slide down from the medium style to become a short style, perhaps that will work? But, from the perspective of Chinese literary history, grand writings are truly rare and precious (a phoenix with horns is a type of amphibious animal, it is said). In our [National Writings] -- this should be listed alongside National Arts, National Shame, and National Studies, not the document held by the ambassador to England or France -- I have never seen a single grand poem or essay. Perhaps you believe this? For this reason, I am somewhat indifferent to short essays after all: you see, I want to add a few grand works to the National Writings. I must aim for the highest of the high, in order to attain the high; I must run to the top of the limitless, so as to generate the Tai Chi. Tai Chi Chuan is a National Art, and Tai Chi writing would be perfect as National Writings. When my masterpiece is born, even George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare will have to acquire Chinese nationality and learn our National Studies. Therefore, I still cannot slide downwards; "carp leaping over the dragon gate" is my attitude. Do you know the grand method of grand writing? Have you seen God create man? I know, I have seen it. God said, "Let there be light in the world," and with a swoosh! Golden light radiated everywhere, fifteen suns, along with hundreds of millions of stars of various sizes, all laughing together. God said, "Let there be people in the world," with a bang! A sea of people, human hearts and lungs, human feelings and reason, human lives hanging in the balance. You see, my grand method of grand writing, even if it is incompetent, must resemble this. You ask me to write short essays, if I lack even a bit of humor, it would be extremely anxious and unacceptable!</p>
<p>If you think this is all wrong, then what exactly is a short essay in your opinion! Wishing you</p>
<p>good luck! Your younger brother Lao She, bowing</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>They were both shelling melon seeds. A silence settled between them for a while. Haiquan suddenly thought of Mrs. Tsuruko at this moment. At the same time, he suspected what Ms. Zhuo had called him here for. He wanted to ask her directly, but he hesitated politely.</p>
<p>[I originally disliked this place. But there was no other way; I couldn't find a suitable house for a while. You see, two or three families live in this one house.]</p>
<p>[What kind of family lives downstairs?]</p>
<p>Haiquan asked this directly. She didn't answer immediately; he saw her cheeks turn slightly red.</p>
<p>[We sublet from downstairs. After moving in, we learned that they were...]</p>
<p>She said, her cheeks reddening even more, and she lowered her head.</p>
<p>[Then you should move sooner.]</p>
<p>[Haven't I already told my mother? But… Mr. Lin, you're not an outsider; to be honest with you, we really can't afford a too expensive house. I have an older brother who works as a small clerk in the ×× Bureau, and his monthly salary is only thirty-odd dollars. When my father wasn't dead…]</p>
<p>She was complaining in this way, as if feeling endless emotions.</p>
<p>[How many siblings do you have?]</p>
<p>[One older brother, one older sister, and I am the youngest.]</p>
<p>[What about your sister?]</p>
<p>When Haiquan asked this, she hesitated again. After a while, she said,</p>
<p>[Married and went to Tianjin with her husband.]</p>
<p>After sitting for a while longer, a maid brought him a cup of lukewarm, brown tea. Haiquan felt a bit embarrassed sitting there and wanted to take his leave. But Zhuo Shuhua noticed.</p>
<p>[Let me go call my mother and brother to meet you. They really want to get to know you.]</p>
<p>She said as she walked out. She didn't seem to go downstairs. He thought, she probably went to the attic. In just a moment, she walked back smiling. She dragged a chair and sat closer to him. He smelled an intriguing fragrance.</p>
<p>[It wouldn't be bad to put my arm around her and smell the fragrance. At most, she'll laugh and scold me and walk away. If I had the courage, I might not even hit a wall.]</p>
<p>But he was only thinking it; his face was already flushed red. At the same time, he was afraid that this base behavior would cause her to despise him.</p>
<p>[What does it matter if she despises me? The truth is, I completely lack any courage.]</p>
<p>[Mr. Lin, I heard that your brother-in-law is a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Finance, is that true?]</p>
<p>[That's not true.]</p>
<p>He quickly denied it. But he already sensed that she was asking about that Master Ren.</p>
<p>[That's what everyone says, his surname is Yin.]</p>
<p>She tilted her head, looking thoughtful.</p>
