<p>華北今已在敵軍包圍威脅之下中日間已談判停戰吾人此時雖尙未知</p>
<p>其條件如何要之此次之停戰即爲中日議和之第一步則可無疑自前年九一八以來不戰不和亦戰亦和之混沌局勢其將揭開最後之搆和序幕乎</p>
<p>當九一八禍變爆發之初吾人即認定在日帝國主義傳統的在陸政策下</p>
<p>絶無和之可能我政府固一再表示不爲武力所屈寗爲玉碎不爲瓦全人民亦奔走呼號堅持抵抗以爭我國家民族之生存然而今日已以談判停戰聞矣當局固聲明於不妥協不求和之精神下試行談判停戰然而欲於此不妥協不求和之中尋覓諒解之途徑和平之機會恐甚易得也</p>
<p>吾人之意以爲和而真能有利於國則和亦未嘗不可其和之先决條件</p>
<p>最低限第一應雙方有和之誠意日須放棄其欺騙之行爲第二須有和以後之辦半即我應有臥薪嘗膽之决心然而以事實證之日本初佔遼吉之時聲言不攻錦州未幾又進攻錦州矣初佔錦州之時聲言不越長城未幾又進越長城矣即如去歲上海協定簽訂而後日本對榆關熱河以至灤州仍繼續進攻初不以上海協定之故而停止其侵略之行動試觀日方之不顧信義若是得步進步若是而能望其有議和之誠意乎無誠意之談判非特難言和平即和平亦不過爲暫時之狀態至於爲强敵武力所威脅不得已而忍辱負重降心爲城下之盟徴之各國史例固亦常有即以德法兩國論拿破崙之戰德國忍痛言和能自奮而仍爲强國普法之役法亦其危而仍不失爲强國最近歐洲大戰列强迫德訂立凡爾賽條約而德今日依然與列强爭衡又如我古之越王勾踐不惜肉袒牽羊以求和而卒成沼吳之功蓋惟能自奮而後能自强有臥薪嘗膽之精神乃始能忍肉袒牽羊之辱然而返觀我國今日之現狀則又何如數十年來我舉國上下泄泄沓沓怠惰奢侈相習成風不求長進致造成今日一蹶不振之局迨外患旣起日人以極强烈之壓力加之於我吾人方謂可稍覺悟矣然而東北三省陷而我國泄泄沓沓依然進而榆關失熱河棄而泄沓如故即至最近敵騎越長城而南迫近平津而我國仍若不見不聞酣歌恒舞如故尋飲行樂如故夫以國難至於如此之嚴重禍臨頭上猶不知覺而謂和平之後事成陳迹反能臥薪嘗膽乎旣無臥薪嘗膽之决心即無復仇雪恥之希望則城下之盟徒自取辱徒自投於毁滅之途耳</p>

<p>濟、又蒙上海輿論界極力宣</p>
<p>傳、先政府而提倡、又蒙吳市</p>
<p>長鐵城居中策劃、先中央而運動、頃又承蔣委員長介石·慨捐萬元、先黨國要人而輸將、凡此種種、均足以表現一個良好之印象、敢代表全體難僑、首致十二萬分之敬謹道謝、竹林等此次受旅墨被迫回國華僑之委託、留駐滬濱、約有下列兩個重要使命、一·督促政府向墨國嚴厲交涉、制止排華、以期保障現在旅墨僑胞（指未回國者）之生命財産、勿再受排華之影響、致遭驅逐、二·在祖國設法救濟被迫回國之四千華僑、以謀解决其生活、昭蘇其痛苦、惟交涉與救濟、兹事體大、非得各方之協力提倡、不能收偉大效果、况代表等久居海外、初度南旋、祖國情形、諸多隔膜、又非得各界之指導提携、難以發展、故於今日特備祖筵、禮請各界之指導、並將墨國排華真相、奉陳一切、此爲同人敬設宴會之原因及其意義也、頃承諸公不我遐棄、惠然肯來、足見關心難僑、感愧交集、謹掬愚誠、叩首拜謝、然同人此次、關於請求交涉及呼籲救濟之辦法及其目的安在、亟爲各界所欲知者、敬爲諸公縷述陳之、</p>
<h3 id="c129">救濟辦法 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>關於辦法方面、（一）先組立難</p>
<p>僑維持會於上海、以期集中全</p>
<p>體難僑之精神與力量、爲保障</p>
<p>難僑利益之設計指導機關、</p>
<p>二）着手舉行難僑總登記、分析技術人才、以憑設法安置、而解倒懸、。（三）募集鉅欵、創設華僑工廠於上海、專以收容一般墨國排華被迫回國而失業之華僑、以安定其生活、而免流爲乞丐、（四）所有關於救濟事宜、無論爲募欵或支配、統由前項難僑維持會全權處理之、以收一救濟之效、而免紛歧、</p>
<h3 id="c130">請求政府 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>關於目的方面、請求於政府者有五、（一）</p>
<p>捐助相當欵項、（或二十萬）充作華僑工廠基金</p>
<p>、（二）在上海鄰近地點、惠贈</p>
<p>五十畝荒地、爲建築前項工廠之地基、（三）另指撥相當公地、以供難僑種植或經營其他農業、（四）最短時間、令飭海軍部指派兵艦若干艘、前赴墨國示威、及作有效力之保護、（五）予我難僑以自救之機會及自救之便利、勿爲救濟上之阻碍、</p>
<h3 id="c131">希望得界 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>希望於各界者亦有五、（一）體念華僑</p>
<p>爲國家社會所受之重大犧牲、及此次横被</p>
<p>異族壓迫之苦楚、而予物質上之援助</p>
<p>、（二）糾正政歧視華僑之觀念·及漠視難僑之錯誤、（三）以精神及物質、贊助華僑工廠之實行、尤有進者、昨閲報端得知僑務委員會委員長陳樹人同志、於本月二十二日在中央紀念週報告僑務、其中有云、近來固已將昔日對僑胞歧視之心改變、爲尊重之心、由前之説、陳委員長已明白負責承認昔日歧視僑胞、是此次墨國之排華、愈演愈兇、竟累及旅墨僑胞、損失至四千萬元以上、即爲常局平日漠視僑胞之利益、及保護之不力所致、此種責任、應由政府完全負之、由後之説、政府已改爲尊重之心、即希望政府實行遵重僑胞之金諾、立即予我全體旅墨難僑以滿意之保障及維護、則吾人豈取再求粒米而救濟耶、</p>
<h3 id="c132">報告經過 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>墨國排華已逾兩載、人多知其槪况、</p>
<p>而不知其眞相、良以此中經過、非身</p>
<p>歷其境者不能道也、同人均爲被迫回</p>
<p>國之難僑、躬罹痛苦、飽受剌激、艱</p>
<p>難險</p>
<p>阻、無不備嘗、兹爲使國人撤底明瞭起見、護將其中經過事實、作一槪括之報告、爲我親愛同胞、曁上海各界含涙陳之、幸仁者加以垂察焉、</p>
<h3 id="c133">排華動機 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>外人僑居墨西哥者如美國·日本·</p>
<p>中國·德國·英國·俄國·意</p>
<p>大利·西班牙·不下三十餘萬</p>
<p>人、而墨國何以排華、又何以</p>
<p>單獨排華、此固有研究之價值、窮其所以致此之由、一面爲世界經濟之影、一面爲墨國政治之糾紛、又一面爲我國政府保護之不力、以上數端、即爲此次造成排華惡劣之總因、當時墨國一般失業工人、與夫仇視華僑之政客朋比爲奸、利用機會、極力提倡、互相標榜、由宣傳而活動、由活動而組織、卒於一九三一年六月、公然成立排華黨於墨京、作有實力之排華運動、此爲墨西哥排華之起源及其動機也、</p>
<h3 id="c134">交涉涉無效 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>自墨西哥排華以來、歷時二載、</p>
<p>我政府雖經迭次交涉、然未</p>
<p>嘗作切實有效力之維持、試問</p>
<p>政府、曾派一兵艦前往保護我</p>
<p>華僑乎、無有也、抑曾派過一專員前往交涉及慰問我華僑乎、更無有也、此種最單簡之護僑辦法、政府且未行之、結果、致令我旅墨僑胞、任人凌辱、無所保障、不特横遭驅禁、而且財産被刦一空、甚至驅逐回國、衣食俱無、等於流丐、種種慘酷情形、難以罄述、吾人此次因墨國排華所受精神與物質之損失、欲謂非政府膜視華僑之利益保護不力所致、不可得矣、</p>
<h3 id="c135">壓迫手段 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>我華僑寄跡於墨西哥者、前後</p>
<p>有四萬之衆、在商務上、農業</p>
<p>上、除英德外、實居第三地位</p>

<p>北票唐山陷落</p>
<p>來源逐漸缺乏</p>
<p>電請其他煤礦</p>
<p>趕運國煤接濟</p>
<p>新聲社云、烟煤爲燃料中之最重要者、如工廠輪船火車等燃料非此不可、自華北軍事發生後、開濼與北票兩煤礦、均爲敵軍侵佔、貨運阻滯、以致來原缺乏、本市烟煤、發生恐慌、新聲社記者、昨特往訪煤業同業公會諸委員、據稱、本埠烟煤銷路頗鉅、以開濼家用篩塊開濼二號篩塊、開濼一號屑、開濼二號屑、開濼特别屑爲最多、大同二炭篩塊、大同原煤篩塊、大同原煤、大同屑、大同篩納爾、曁中興篩塊中興煤屑次之、長興篩塊、長興屑、井陘篩塊、井陘屑、六河溝篩塊、六河溝屑華東篩塊、華東屑、華東原煤、博山小山篩塊、博山篩塊、北票篩塊、北票屑囊山篩塊、黌山屑等又次之、但北票煤因日軍侵佔影響暫時停止運滬、開濼煤雖亦受影響、因係中英台辦、懸有英旗、故仍可運滬、惟數前減少、其他各煤、均照常運滬、况中日停戰在即、交通不久可恢復、故本市烟煤或不致發生重大缺乏之虞云、</p>
<p>大陸報云、記者昨日遍詢本埠煤業情形</p>
<p>後、得一驚人消息、本埠工業、不久或將因缺乏燃料故、大受阻滯、據可靠消息、本埠存煤、現已不敷一月之用、若在平時、常有二三月之存煤、其故由於本埠主要供給者開濼礦務局暫停出煤所致、記者昨訪開濼中人、對於暫停出煤之説、旣不否認、亦不徴實、僅謂可以供給報紙紀載之消息、必須由北方總局發出而已、按此間所接消息、該局礦工、已於日軍進至唐山時逃散、致目下生産與運輸、俱告停頓、唯不論此訊之是否可靠、本埠存煤歉薄、確係事實、昨聞本埠實業界領袖、業電國産各煤礦、趕運接濟、而各礦生人亦允盡力使魯豫兩省所産之煤、源源來滬、即本埠銀行家、亦允供給經濟助力、藉爲便利各礦之生産與運輸、並據煤商消息、邇來魯煤與豫煤之來滬者已大增於數星期前、惟豫煤須由平漢路運至漢口後、裝船來滬、近來平漢車輛、因須軍運故、運輸上發生新困難、魯煤則由津浦車運、費用過鉅、運輪更感困難、現聞中興擬敷設三十哩鐵路、啣接隴海路、俾可由隴海線至海州、換船來滬、大省運輸成本、並聞中興當局爲籌欵計、已商諸金融界領袖、亦已獲得同意、此項新發展、觀成雖尙須時日、但信亦未嘗不能於短時期内實現、以救濟上海煤荒云、</p>

<p>救濟農村經濟問題、行政院曾於本月五</p>
<p>六兩日、在京召集復興農村委員會决定辦法大綱、並商請本市銀行公會籌設農村金融調劑委員會、兹銀行公會、已定於本星期内　召集執行委員會議　討論農村金融調劑委員會籌設事宜、中央社記者、昨晨向銀行界方面探悉、關於本市銀行界對於農村金融調劑之意見如次、</p>
<h3 id="c142">集中力量 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>本市銀行界、均認爲農</p>
<p>村金融之衰落、影響於</p>
<p>全國整個金融安全者</p>
<p>極大設法救濟刻不容緩、故本市銀行界對於農村金融調劑委員會之籌設、一部份咸主張集中力量進行、即集中各銀行力量於農村金融調劑、委員會由該委員會主持救濟及調劑事宜、惟恐該委員會鞭長莫及、受其惠者僅及上海附近、而不能遍達各地、</p>
<h3 id="c143">分别進行 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>

<p>員會成立後、由該委員</p>
<p>會、擬具調劑辦法、分請各銀行自行向各鄉區辦理、例如甲銀行在甲地辦理、乙銀行在乙地辦理、而各大銀行均在各地設有分行、自動分區進行、收效之速、勝於前條所述辦法、惟其流弊則恐行而不力、上述兩頌意見、將於執行委員會開會時提出討論、</p>

<p>干、在各鄉區設立農民</p>
<p>借本機關以供農民於</p>
<p>青黄不接時、告貸有所、法良意美、但主其事者設不明此項機關設立之主旨、反事剥削、則大不可、故本市銀行界對於籌辦農民借本機關、對於避免此種流弊、當予充分注意、俾不失農民金融調劑之本旨、而與農民以便利也云、</p>

<p>丨宜昌田崇恃君來信丨</p>
<p>我見着貴欄内許多疑難的問題，都是你答覆的。我現在也有許多的事，請詳細指示我罷。我現在已經有了十八歲了。在以前七年的中間，生活上都是很可以過的。我的父親是一個商人，也曾把我送到私塾，讀了三四年書，後來因市面蕭條，没有生意，兼之我的父親染上鴉片和各種的嗜好，一天一天的下去，把一個美滿的家庭，成了「日無鷄索米，夜無鼠盜糧」了！我的父親，因受經濟打擊，不得已出外求生活去了。就把我的母親和我，我的妹妹弟弟，都抛下了。我的母親把家中的東西，當賣完了，把生活混過！希望我的父親寄錢回來，誰知一去兩年，分文没寄回家。我的母親想生活上全無着落，那裏還有我的讀書的經費，於是便托人介紹我去學徒弟。後來經過我的舅父將我送在一家機器掛麫廠學生意，誰知進店以後，毫無生意經紀，簡直可一目了然。我那個時候才十三歲，知識弱小，毫不拒絕，後來我也漸漸覺得這種生意毫無巧妙，就是未學過的，也可做得到。我也告訴母親好幾次不願意做的意思，我的母親因爲經濟困難，回家豈不是也要受餓，便哄着我說，行行出狀元，你不　着急，三年出了師，自己借幾個錢，也可做一家。我就慢慢做下去，而我想求學的能力是没有了。只在三年之中向寫算上去研究。但是店東連報也不定一份，所以求學的進步就少了一個帮助，看看三年已經到了，我决定不做了。也不告訴母親，向店東辭了事，把我的被褥一齊都搬了回去。那時我的母親也無可如何了。不久我的父親也回來了。母親替他想法子做生意，結果做了一個鴉片館，每天能夠賺得半塊錢，稍可敷補生活。我想我在家中非久長之計，又托人介紹人一家雜貨店做事。雜貨店比較麫廠好一點。但是初進去工錢很少，每月只有兩塊錢拿回家去。省節的用可以用三天。現在宜昌忽起禁烟潮流，一切做鴉片生意，部不許做，我的父親除了做鴉片館外，什麽事情都不願意做，生活費又無着落了。就是我的工錢拿回去用，這二十七天需要又由何處出呢？母親也憂病了，三天不吃飯，二天不燒火的景象，也光臨了。我想我這回時候又不會别的手藝，怎麽能多弄錢。想向店東多用工錢，一則老板的生意不好，二則我也没有多大本領，怎配多用錢，我想做生意，又没有本錢，我若不照顧家裏，豈不是一家都餓死不成嗎？我若照顧起來，我又没有這大的力量，你看我的將來和現在是多麽危險呵！我這種不幸的事，呌我喊天不應，入地無門，悽慘呵！我存心寫這信已久，直到今天晚上才寫出來，請你可憐我罷，替我想一個辦法。</p>
<p>答：看了你的信，我們心裏着實難過。爲你打算，你現在只能將你所得的工錢做爲你母親的生活費，你父親可以不管他。我們對於吸鴉片的人不必抱什麽憐憫的心思，他們已成爲社會的贅疣。你母親有了兩塊錢一個月，再給人家洗洗衣服，或是做點什麽女工，她便可不致餓肚子了。在舉世茫茫的人海中，全社會的根本問題不解决，對於足下的境遇，也就别無善法。</p>

<p>▲市長訓話　檢閱畢由主席鄭西谷致詞後、首由吳市長訓話略謂、今天上海市童子軍在上海市民面前來舉行檢閱、其重要意義就是要時常檢閱我們國民的力量、童子軍是我們中國的學生、是精練的青年、亦卽將來社會的幹部、國家的棟樑、其所負之責任是很大、諸位在求學時代就是受敎育、增加智識能力、以備將來担負國家大任、在過去幾十年、因爲我們的祖先没有努力、或者努力不得法無結果、致今日中國四分五裂、更受日本人壓迫、雖我國軍民始終抵抗、但仍不能打退日人、此完全是中國過去一百年時候没有準備、才有今日痛苦、我們如爲將來的中華民國設想、此刻就不能不培養力量、而此種力量就是在你們身上諸位好像一顆一樹、一朶嫰花、國家培植諸位、就是要使諸位長成棟樑、所以要希望諸位立很大的志願、作極大的準備、將來負救中國的責任、今天看見上海童子軍有如此良好的訓練、實在是中國的未來的希望、還望繼續努力鍛練身體、增加智識、將來作中國的好國民云、</p>
<p>▲戴氏訓話　次戴司令訓話略謂、今天到此地來參加、兄弟非常高興、中國今日不特一年不如一年、差不多一日不如一日了、負救國責任而最有希望者在青年、而且需要雄糾糾氣昂昂的青年、但看歐戰時德國戰、散後、全國武裝完全解除、而今日德國的地位又是很重要了、這全在德國全國人民的努力、這種努力的精神、很可爲我們取法的、現在國家危亡我們不用悲觀、祗要全國人民能爭氣希望諸位可敬可愛的青年、以德國人民的精神爲榜樣、總有一天能報仇雪恥云、</p>

<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>農村向來是用慣國貨的，可是最近據各方的報告仇貨已如水銀瀉地，</p>
<p>無孔不入，挾其傾銷之政策，利用奸商之技俩，居然深入内地，奪我國貨的銷路了。可憐最近的農村，本已衰敗破落，不堪言狀，普通農家，蓋藏已無，都是家徒四壁，竟無隔食之糧，本已談不到什麽享受，連這購買力也没有。國貨的出路，本已感到十分困難，於是販賣仇貨的，便利用這農民窮困的機會，把質窳價錢的貨物，一批一批的運到内地，迎其心理，投其所好，而無知無力的農民，便甘心爲仇貨之大主顧，於是而仇貨之來，排山倒海，如入無人之境，把燈盡油乾的農民再被販賣仇貨的來榨取一番，可憐的農村，可憐的農民，持刀授人，俯頭待割，我想目下談農村復興的，曾否想到？曾否見到？在内地販賣仇貸的店舗，問他們爲什麽甘心爲</p>
<p>虎作倀，來陷害國人，他們都説家家如此，他販仇貨，吾不販仇貨，眼見人家購錢，而自已虧本，誰肯甘心，有一位專做百貨生意的，他在上海四鄉開有好幾處棉布舖，他説在一二八後，祇有四五個月是做清公事，居然没有一様仇貨。後來我們一業中貪小利的，慢慢販賣仇貨了，一家販，家家販，到了現在，已成公開的秘密，反正是没有人來干涉，落得而爲之，嬉皮笑臉，這種混帳東西誅不勝誅，滔滔皆是。上海如此，内地也如此，昔人謂哀莫於心死，現在的心，真像都死了，還談什麽？唉可憐，可憐今年的國貨年，徒負虚名，祇落得報紙的熱閙，廣告的煌染，其實那裏是國貨年，簡直是仇貨最充斥的一年，可説是仇貨。問政府，政府不敢問，問社會，社會部默不作聲，昔時煊赫之什麽會，什麽組織，遺留的成績太好了，早已千夫所指，無疾而終。可憐可憐，這是成何世界，成何社會呢。獨有農村方面於無辦法中，還有一個小辦法。便是地方上要有幾個戇人，努力的肯勵行進口檢查與統計，譬如一個月内，香烟進口多少？疋頭進口多少？草帽進口多少？玻璃器進口多少？玻璃器皿進口多少？汗衫襪子進口多少？造一個精確的統計，便用消費合作的辦法，集中的直接的向國貨製造廠家批購來支配全村農民。並須有正當機關爲之證明。這様一來，如果嚴密公正的做去，包你仇貨無法漏網，袛要各地改進農村的領袖，肯下决心，費大氣力的幹去，倒一定有好結果，好成績，比較上海和大都會地方，倒覺得比較容易着手，希望熱心農村的同志來試騐一下。</p>

<p>『國貨最大的來原，是農村，國貨</p>

<p>在上期本刋裏，已很澈底的告訴我們這兩句話，的確·國貨工廠從農村裏吸取了大量的原料，製造成品後再輸進農村，去供給他們的需用，兩者間的密切關係，一往一來，照例是應該同舟共濟，循環不息的·但是·自從近來農村經濟衰落的深刻化，購買力一天天的薄弱，嚴重的狀態，影響了國貨的銷路，使發展國貨事業的前途，添了一重最大的障礙，旁的我們且不説，單據最近嘉屬六縣國貨流動展覽會，松江國貨展覽會的報告，成績的差度，實爲歷年來各次展覽會所未有，足見農村經濟極度的疲敝，加速的崩潰，事實俱在，昭然若揭，而我們對於在現在情勢下，單靠力絶聲嘶的宣傳的流動推銷，已失去了相當的效用·急需以新的方法來補救，也可藉此得了一個深切的認識，那麽我們國貨工廠此後的趨勢·究是如何？怎様可以除去前途的荆棘，不妨害我們回定的進行程序？我們很明瞭農村的徧枯，是由於都市的澎漲，自然，我們也只有補佐金融界實業界竭力設法援助農村，放還農村所儒用的生産資金，使他們再可努力從事和增加生産，况且發展農業，也就是所以減低國貨工業之原本，脈息相關，不容漢視，『旦農村漸有生機，商業當然即能復興，銷路就可猛進，這種鞏固本身發展前途的要圖，我們自然刻不容緩，至於如何規定有計劃有組織的方計，還希望諸國貨先進，『長慮却顧』，加以深切的研究而進行·</p>

<p>現代的所謂國貨是變相的外貨，土</p>

<p>都知道吸國貨香烟，可是，試看民國十八年香烟原料丨掷香烟紙丨的進口值爲二六○○○○○○兩，民國二十年爲四八○○○○○○兩，這是一個多麽驚人的數目丨我們算一一算，這筆欵子，至少可辦現在的省立中學數百所。其他關於衣食方面的還要説嗎？唉丨親愛的同胞們，醒醒罷，要利源不外溢，惟有服用土貨。服用土貨，是我們的天職，是我們的自救。</p>
<p>諸位要反駁我罷？『如國人大家服</p>

<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>記得以前本刋揭載過谷園先生的『大</p>
<p>學國貨運動』一文，將一般愛用外貨的大學生的心理和習慣，描冩得酣暢淋漓，無微不至，可稱一篇針　末俗，有功國貨的文章。惟據不侫管見所及，以爲欲齊其末，先治其本：初小學生實爲大學生之根苗，每個大學生俱從初小學生造就；所以要想糾正大學生這錯誤心理與不良習慣，應自它的根苗時代的初小學生做起。用是不揣謭陋，學步邯鄲，而作初小國貨運動。</p>
<p>才進學校門檻的初小學生，原屬渾</p>
<p>渾噩噩，自無所謂智識可言，更談不到愛國二字。它們唯知有衣即穿，有物即用，對於物質上的抉擇，絶對莫明其妙。而爲之家長者，亦大都缺乏鑒别國貨的能力，祇要是切於子女需要的東西，就貿然爲之採購，貨物之來源，非所顧及：甚至有明知其爲外貨，或者竟是劣貨，因爲貪圖　的好看與便宜，亦即不顧一切地予以購買：於是遂造成外貨充斥於初小學界的今日現象。試一涉足各個初小學校，向御外貨的學生，幾於觸目皆是：馴而至於所用的鉛筆洋簿，所玩的皮球檯球，也有不少是舶來品。乃一般敎師都是雙目如盲，熟視無覩；實則它們並非不見·多因身上所穿·一様也是外貨，自已先無愛國觀念，那裏還有指導學生的心思？所以最令人齒冷的，以全校觀瞻所繋的校旗制服，竟有狠多用洋布製成；學校當局已存漠視國貨之心，尙何能望其屬下擯絶外貨不用呢？</p>
<p>全國的初小學校，其數難以僂指計</p>
<p>；而全國的初小學生，尤其是多如恒河沙數。這恒河沙數的外貨推銷員，其所影響於振興國貨前途，不在十餘萬智識階級大學生之下；而也的漏巵之巨，至少與大學生消費者相埒丨或且超而過之丨這種『積非成是』的不知信仰國貨</p>
<p>的惡習，若不急起注意，把牠改變過來；那麽誠有如谷園先生所説『勢致全國所有的財力，盡被外商吮吸以去』。財盡民窮，國亡可待丨</p>
<p>不侫以爲敎員乃學生模範，凡爲初</p>
<p>小學校的敎員，自宜以身作則，而有切實服用國貨之必要丨對於學生方面，倘有外貨發現，亟應不憚煩勞，諄諄勸誡，務俾有所領悟，不復再用而已丨且須隨時將國貨與外貨在服用上的利害，剴切詳明，善爲解釋，藉以養成其尊崇國貨輕蔑外貨的觀念；庶幾他日由小學而中學，而大學，不致更蹈愛用外貨的舊轍。一旦踏上社會，身任羣衆領導，成績自會斐然可觀丨</p>
<p>當此國貨年開始之時，各地已表示</p>
<p>着熱烈擁護。想來站在表率人民地位的全國初小學校的校長敎員，愛國之忱，定當不落人後。甚盼大家一致起來，轟轟烈烈地加以提倡，堅持厥志，終始弗懈丨國貨前途，受賜實多。努力罷丨不佞延頸跂踵的瞧着呵丨</p>
<h3 id="c230">工業原業調查我國製造炭酸鈣事業之調查（上） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>翻開一本化學工業的專著來，第一篇就是載着炭酸鈣的化學原理。誠然，炭酸鈣在化學</p>
<p>工業原料上，是佔着最重要的位置，尤其是橡膠業，化妝品，造紙，製糖，油漆，油墨，這些工業，都以炭酸鈣爲主要原料。</p>
<p>『提倡國貨，抵制仇貨！』這是舉國一致的口號，但是，一種國貨工業的製造，其最主要</p>
<p>的條件，還是在於原料問題：否則，以外國的原料，來製造本國出品，利權仍不免外溢！我國現在最感困難者，就是原料的缺乏，卽以炭酸鈣一物而論；説也可憐，在我們中國能設廠自製，是僅僅乎只有二年的歷史，在民國二十年以前，我國可説是找不到一個製造炭酸鈣的工廠！這様的所謂抵制外貨，試想能有多大有成效？</p>
<p>在民國二十年，國人因鑒於橡膠事業之發達，以及國産原料的缺乏，更以萬寳山案起，抵制日貨的呼聲甚高，於是有志之士，羣起以謀設廠自造。在這一年，上海一埠，同時便成立了三個製造炭酸鈣的工廠；一個是肇新化事廠，一個是大中華製鈣廠，一個是新業化工廠。我國有了這三家製鈣廠，在同時興起，於是炭酸鈣的原科問題，在我國工業製造上，便根本獲得了解决。的確！這是我國工業史上，最好的一個紀録呞！是值得介紹於我們國貨工商界的。所以我把這三個製鈣的最近調查，來簡略的介紹一下；</p>
<p>（一）肇新化學廠　肇新廠設在滬西陳家渡，有資本二十五萬元，經理李祖彝君，曾在德國ＨＡＮＮＯＹＥＲ大學械科畢業，得有碩士學位，是我國機械工程學一位有數的人才。李君對於機械研究，有極精細的經騐，所以該廠一切機械，均由李君親自設計裝配，完全採取國貨機件，這一點是創辦國貨工廠之所最難能的。董事長方液仙君，爲國貨界中一位最熱心的人，他所經營的事業；有中國化學工業明，晶明玻璃廠，開成造酸公司，中國國貨公事等。肇新廠的出品，有一部份便是供給中國化學工業社爲製造化妝品的原料。該廠還有一位常務董事郭永康君，也是對於國貨事業很有供獻的人，他曾經在日本長期考察過，對於日本的化學工業，調查得很詳細；他曾親赴南洋羣島英美法各屬調查國貨事業，所以他對於世界的工商業情形，是非常熟悉的。該廠出品的族牌炭酸鈣，其製造方法是倣照德國式而參以日本式。現在每日的産量，能出一百六十七十包，（每句重一百磅）其重量在一萬六七千磅。他的出品，徐以一部份供給中國化學工業社製造化妝品外，大部分是銷售全國各橡膠廠，據多數化學專家的化騐結果，我國自製的炭酸鈣，應推該廠的出品質地最輕。（炭酸钙的成分愈輕愈純）該廠出品的總經理處，在河南路二五千號利工工業原料號。</p>

<h3 id="c231">康元廠參觀記 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 俞洽成</p>
<p>先前在許多刋物上早已認了康元廠的輪廓，這次去參觀的確是有腹稿的。從滬西到滬東，雖然仍舊在上海的範圍以内，却花費了相當的時間，靜坐在車上，　帶着一種狩獵也似的沉思，準備去尋獲一些新的材料。</p>
<p>這是一種奇蹟吧！說明了來意以後，便獲得允許，有趣的是我用婉轉的語氣詢問丨</p>
<p>「能不能今天便給我一個機會？」</p>
<p>幷不因爲没有預先約定而遭拒絕，項康原先生率直的便回答：</p>
<p>「好，我們是不要什麽準備的！」</p>
<p>由廠裏兩位職員的領導，走遍了全部康元廠，包括寄宿舍，工作場以及運動場之類，到處有說明，到處有解釋，尤其是看到廠訓的時候，那位先生會得口若懸河的說明一番。</p>
<p>工廠裏大槪從畫樣，落石，印刷，磨光，製罐，以至裝箱，包括若干部分，好像一個循環，從這裏到那裏，有秩序的做過若干手續。另外有化騐部，是專爲化騐油墨的處所。參觀的時候正在工作，可是祗有機器聲和鐵皮落地的聲音。</p>
<p>關於工作的實際，當然不能由門外漢擅自平旦，可是工場的清潔以及秩序的優好，却得給我一個很美滿的印象。</p>
<p>宿舍是非常的整潔，一色的被褥，好似軍隊和學校（其實中國的軍隊和學校還不能如此呢！）如果不是在康元廠看見，誰都不敢說是工人的宿舍，因爲中國工人生活的苦况，巳經是不可否認的事實呵！</p>
<p>儲衣櫉裏面是整齊的，雖然都是粗布的衣服，却没有油漬和凌亂，康元工人自治的力量，於此也可證明已超過一般的標準。</p>
<p>敎導部的標語，信條和敎室，都是和學校一般，那位領導的先生逐件的介紹，能夠流水也似的講那些東西，可惜不在上課時候，否則我也得參觀一番工廠學校化的實際。</p>
<p>飯廳在二樓，由廠内自辦，關於衛生和工人的待遇，這實在是改善的很多。運動場，醫院，職員住宅都在廠裏；據康元廠槪况上所刋載，還有義勇軍，童子軍，國術隊的組織，而消防也是著名，可惜没有碰着機會，參觀到那些實際的工人活動。</p>
<p>這是理想化的工廠吧！一切是家庭化，學校化的，雖然不能說可以完全解决了工人的痛苦，可是有許多無味的苦惱，却也減去不少：然而，這絕不是浪費，康元出品的優良，榮譽和收穫，也足爲報酬。</p>
<p>在我參觀的時候，有一位大槪是研究勞工問題的，也在那裏參觀，關於工人方面，曾提有若干問題，都獲得相當的答復。</p>
<p>春天的中午，一個人獨自走出康元廠，恰巧一羣外國兵在空地作野戰演習，許多中國人却以爲熱鬧而嘻着嘴作壁上觀，絕對没有些許的痛苦的表現，這實在使我增加了若干的感觸。</p>
<h3 id="c232">内地鄕鎭與國貨 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>數星期來，國貨流動推銷團很努力的到過不少城鎭鄕村去工作，據他們最近的報告，有二點値得我們急切的注意：一，是上海附近的鄕鎭上還是充塞着洋貨　貨，二，是該團旗幟到處，萬人空巷，並且貨品零售，供不敷求。</p>
<p>第一點，最含有嚴重性，　因爲在農村集結，智力未充的内地鄕鎭，讓這些洋貨，仇貨，不息的流轉，使得基本民衆，永永没有對國貨見面，這是多麽危殆而亟待救治的事？内地店舖所以不得不販賣洋貨仇貨，據說他們也有片面的苦衷，爲了外貨利益厚，要顧全店基的命脈和夥友的生活，只能飲鴆止渴的這樣做去，萬萬没有販售利益極薄的國貨的可能，兼之顧客貪價廉，愛花俏，無暇計及國貨非國貨了，因此病根深植，積重難返。</p>
<p>如果也用上海那種發警告投炸彈去禁止奸商不賣洋貨的手段來施諸内地店舖，我敢武斷說，收效是同樣的低微，根本還在於國貨工廠應如何孜孜以求成本减輕，降落售價，應如何改良出品，銳意求情，否則，儘擠在上海高呌提倡國貨，勸人服用國貨，而内地依舊外貨湧塞，散播農村，試問於實際奚益？</p>
<p>第二點似乎可以稍覺安慰，實在說起來，鄕鎭人民並不是絕對愛用洋貨仇貨，根本上他們並未認識國貨，同時店舖的販售洋貨仇貨，也足使民衆和國貨遮隔起一層幕幛來，歷來各大城市的國貨展覽會，缺乏眞切的普遍的宣傳工作，收不到深入民間的效力，一切組織簡單經濟短絀的國貨旅行集團，也是跑碼頭式的草草從事，留不住深刻的印象，我想最近正在努力做去的國貨流動推銷團，或許是可以産生一些成績。</p>
<p>因爲國貨流動推銷團是直接和各國貨廠家有密切關係，組織上，使命上，都比較有進一步的步驟，我以爲牠不僅負有提起内地民衆對國貨認識的任務，還應拿有力的方法，去友助和引導内地店舖經營國貨，最短期中肅清外貨！</p>
<p>我很慚愧的敢拿上面二點意見貢諸各國貨工廠曁國貨流動推銷團的諸先生。</p>
<h3 id="c233">如是我聞之販賣日貨語 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 自强</p>
<p>暴日臨頭，天人共僨，偕亡立誓，舉國若狂，此所以經濟絕交，抵制日貨，成爲當前最重要之工作也。然而奸商市僧，販賣如常，所謂日貨者，五光十色，充斥市塲，欲求明辨其眞僞，蓋亦已難矣。</p>
<p>不寗惟是，抑且更立牌號，巧換商標，魚目混珠，無從置辨，惜　禹鼎溫犀，洞鑿其奸，良爲恨事。此等日本之走狗，爲虎作倀，固罪不容於死，人人得食其肉也。</p>
<p>雖然，聞之奸商之言曰：（非正式聞之乃傳聞之）東洋貨深中一般人之心理，雖欲抵制而不可得，蓋以用之者衆，苟無以應之，則將顧而之他，縱此方能抵制，又烏能保持彼方不進行自若也。</p>
<p>噫！是言也，雖罪在奸商，而一般醉生夢死之民衆，固亦不得不尸其咎焉；吾謂此等責任，應責成有地方之責者，隨時加以宣傳，曉以大義，使彼奸商無以收其利，庶幾國貨前途，不致喧賓奪主耳。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我常常這樣地呆想，假如當時海禁不開，我們中國人到現在，是否依然没有進步的嗎？還有假如當時海禁不開，我們中國人當然到現在也是一代一代的生活着，總不至於一出世來，便即死去，試看中國歷史，却是一代一代的進步，再也看不到一代退步一代的事實，從前中國的威風，眞是震驚世界，那裏知道到了現在，無論在外交上，商業上，没有一樣不受外人的拘束，受外人的蹂躪，而莫自由拔，我想這個毛病是出在海禁大開上面，一自海禁開後，各國的貨品，紛至沓來，造成了中國人用外貨的腦筋，一直到現在，更其變本加厲，甚至穿的非西裝不漂亮，住的非洋房不舒適，吃的非大菜不果腹，行的非汽車不高興………，（這是講的富豪，差不多的人，當然不能辦到；可是少量的外貨推銷，必不能免，）假如海禁不開，現在總不會棄了中國綢緞或布疋的衣服不穿，丢了中國式華麗住宅不居，搬了山珍海錯的肴饌不吃，放了車轎不坐之理。</p>
<p>「人類是好奇的動物！」這是不錯的，惟其好奇，所以總會喜新厭舊，喜新厭舊，纔會棄了精華的國貨，而去用糟粕的外貨，這個道理，我是萬萬也想不通的；</p>
<p>「海禁開的好呢，還是不開好？」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>外國貨，在上海說，有些人是呌；「來路貨」的，好一個來路貨的名詞啊！是多少得人讚美呢！時髦的中心人物，他如其穿了一件外國貨的衣服，他一定喜歡在他的朋友面前去誇耀，這是；「道道地地的來路貨呢！」他的朋友，一定附和着問；「眞好，這種來路貨，每尺多少錢啊？」現在時代稍微轉變了一些，你眞的穿了一件外國貨的衣服，因爲國難當頭，不願意說：「這是來路貨，」要說：「你看，國貨多好啊！」我想：身上穿着外國貨，嘴裏再說着穿外國貨，這是罪大莫及：假如穿的外國貨，說是穿着中國貨，我想應得的罪，當加重一級，這不但是遭塌國貨，而且和自己人格還有關係呢！</p>
<p>還有一般不明白時代的女人們，她當然不曉得是西洋貨東洋貨，祇知道花式時新的總是外國貨，把它做來穿在身上，向她的同伴說：「這是來路貨，」講這句話的女人，大槪是些不負生計責任的寄生者，她們消費的力量倒很可觀，却都消費在外國人身上，還要給外國人去竭力官傳，這眞是愚不可及，負有丈夫之責者，正可規勸一下啊！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>我聽見一位熟悉棉布事業的朋友和我誠懇地說；「現在一般奸商，眞是痰迷心竅，蝕了本錢在那裏賣東洋貨！」我聽了，似乎有些不信，　這是中國的古諺：「千做萬做，蝕本不做，」難道竟會蝕了本在那裏賣東洋貨的嗎？這似乎有些費解了，後經仔細調查竟然實有其事，因爲那些奸商，只圖利己，不顧利人，他們提出一二種劣貨，標價廉售，吸引顧客，這樣一般盲目的購衆，也祇知貨品便宜，有那裏想到這是劣貨呢！在他們呢，以劣貨引誘買主，可以旁及其他貨品，坐收其利，用心之險，有如蛇蝎！雖然有××團仍决裂警告，也是無濟於事，我想，這個；「爲國貨服務」的宗旨，要自己來抱定，那纔可靠，假使要人家來催促和警告，最好的結果，祇能收效於現在，不能收效於永遠吧！這樣說起來，要爲國貨服務，單靠宣傳，似乎無濟於事，第一要改造人心；改造人心是一件何等困難的事啊！</p>

<p>— 警</p>
<p>奉賢金匯橋丁永義廠出品的丹心牌軋稻機，可以說是盡善盡美，毫無遺憾的了　　丁永義廠原屬一家專造米機篩子的米篩廠，營業甚稱發達。主人丁式如君，喜研機械之學；五年前，嘗在某處瞧見一部日本出産的軋稻機，它就靜心考察，摩繪成圖，歸而僱工倣製，器成之日，試騐良佳！鄕間遂爭相購用。迄今五載，又復迭次改良，益臻完善！</p>
<p>此機之構造，不甚複雜，所需原料，厥惟木鐵二項。木材用製機身，天然採自國産；即其它附屬品如「鐵釘」「鐵齒」「鐵輪」之類，除「鐵釘」係向海上五金號選購國産螺絲外，餘均自己翻砂製造；所以足稱純粹的國貨軋稻機！再加歷年改良的結果，將機身略爲放寛，俾三四人得以同時工作。而機軸上的「鐵齒」，也視前增多，藉以加添其工作上的效率。就是大小輪盤銜接處的輪齒，亦大事變更，以便易於轉動而增高速力。因此三人一機的工作，日可軋稻十畝左右；比較從前的樌稻，不啻多起三倍以上！有了這樣很好的國産新農具！豈非是値得替它介紹的嗎？</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>際茲二十世紀，男女講究平等。男子旣可在社會上服務，自然，女子也得在職業界做事，這是無可非議的。</p>
<p>不過，我們知道，自從開天闢地以來，男子在社會上服務，並没有博得什麽雅號或尊稱。可是，如今坐在寫字間裏的女職員，却給男子們稱爲「花瓶」丨這是侮辱她們，還講什麽平等？</p>
<p>雖然，細加研究，女職員之所以給男子們目爲「花瓶」，實在是「耶穌自有道理。」換句話說，就是她們「咎由自取」，怪不得誰人。</p>
<p>因爲她們身上穿的花花綠綠，都是「舶來品丨」驗上搽的脂粉香水，無非是「洋貨！」試想，這般打扮得「花枝招展，」坐在寫字間裏，活像是一個洋貨推銷員！那麽，誰去尊敬她？旣得不到尊敬，自然，要遭受侮辱，給男子們隨便看做「花瓶」了。</p>
<p>唉！「花瓶」，好好一個女子，如何可給人家呌「花瓶」？自然囉，這的確是侮辱，而且是重大的侮辱！職業界的姊妹們啊！你們要想打倒這侮辱的稱謂嗎？如果要想打倒這侮辱的稱謂，我倒有一條妙計，願貢獻給你們。這條妙計：就是奉勸你們把身上穿的，臉上搽的，都改用「國貨。」因爲用了「國貨，」大家只有敬佩，即使也一樣可以打扮得「花枝招展，」然而，以「國貨」之尊嚴，誰還敢來侮辱，而呌一聲「花瓶」呢？</p>
<p>怡怡館主按：男子之服用「洋貨」者，也當給以雅號，俾資公平。</p>
<p>但是，這雅號的稱謂，一時頗難想哩。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>喬奇今天上學去的時候，心上很高興，因爲昨天他爸爸已給他買了一個粉紅色的小皮球，拍一記就能夠彈起三尺高，眞是怪好玩的東西。</p>
<p>「惠生，你瞧，這球多麽好啊！」一進校門，喬奇便來不及的把他的小皮球獻給跟他一般都是七歲的小朋友惠生看；可是惠生看了，似乎一些也不注意的神氣，喬奇很覺得納悶，後來惠生也捧了一個球來了。</p>
<p>「你瞧我的，不是比你的大得多嗎」？惠生的球的確比喬奇的球要大好幾倍，上面還有一條條的花紋，顔色是黄的；許多小朋友看了，都說惠生的球好，喬奇的球不好。</p>
<p>喬奇一賭氣，便把球藏了起來，午飯時候回去，急着就跟他爸爸開談判，並且還說出了惠生那個球的式樣和顔色，要他爸爸買一個同樣的回來。</p>
<p>「啊！小孩子，那是東洋貨啊！馬路上的小販們不知道底細，所以胡亂在那裏販賣，我們却萬萬買不得：你的球雖小，總是中華國貨，比他們的東洋貨好多了！」爸爸這樣講解着。</p>
<p>喬奇聽了，便依舊很高興的抱着他的小皮球上學堂去了，見了惠生，便向他笑道：</p>
<p>「你買的是東洋貨，難爲情嗎」？惠生却一定不肯承認是東洋貨，兩個孩子便爭論起來，同學們也都不知道誰是誰非；後來先生來了，一看惠生的球，果然是東洋貨，便告訴了大家聽，惠生不由窘得哭了。</p>
<p>過了一天，惠生也敎他爸爸買了一個跟喬奇一般的國貨小皮球，先生稱讚他。</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>中國人向來王張集天，所以看得『天意』很重。</p>
<p>現在『人事』旣糟到不堪收拾，一切悲憤，牢愁，憤懣的言行，似乎大可不必。因爲，中國的一切，不論是現在，或是將來，丨早經天數排定，决非人力所能挽回。我們在無可奈何之中，如果胸中委實脹得難受的話，還是多喊幾聲『天』。『人』是靠不住的，何况根本就没有人睬你！自從九一八事變以來，中國始終靠託國聯。假使歐美列强自身實力充足，或許能來遠東，不惜拉破面皮，説句公話。偏偏他們又自顧不睱；那裏有閒情管你們中國的閒事。所以日本不顧一切，大膽的打進長城，華北，甚壬：：。中國旣哭訴無門，當然只有一籌莫展的向後退。謂非天意而何！</p>
<p>國聯就不能帮中國的忙；假使中國自已能用全力去抵抗日本，或許不致糟到現在這種地步。偏偏又閙得烏烟瘴氣，『安内』猶恐不及，那裏有餘力去談『攘外』。謂非天意而何！</p>
<p>赤匪雖定足牽制『攘外』，但西南當局苟能負責『安内』，中央三四十萬大軍</p>
<p>，未始不可以去『攘外』。偏偏西南又意存觀望，始終没有出兵。謂非天意而何！</p>
<p>這不過僅就其犖大者而言，此外還有許多零碎的昭示，如近年水旱之災，新疆，西藏，的叛變，山東，四川，貴州，的混戰，西南各省若卽若離的態度，下而至於奸商漢奸的活躍，不先不後，就在國維嚴重時期，打着夥兒來凑熱閙。朝野惶惑，不知所措。自生民以來，熱閙未有甚於今日者也！謂非天意而何！</p>
<p>我對國内時局，向來很抱藥觀。但見到這許多天意的昭示，不哼一聲『嗚呼』。這聲『嗚』</p>
<p>呼』，涵有不得不救，欲救不得，見死不救，無從救起，許多成份的隠痛。但一想到這是天意，也就只索罷了！</p>
<p>嗚呼，國家之興衰存亡，雖曰人事，，豈非天哉！</p>

<p>在夏天，祇要氣候有些煩熱，天時有</p>
<p>此燥悶，或者是幾陣大風的過後，這細微的種種小緣因，都能使夏天落雨的；雖然落的時間並不久，所謂『陣頭雨』，幾分鐘便會停止的，但，那雨勢像瀑布般地狂衝，雨點像竹條般地粗壯，人遇到了是有些駭怕的　女人的眼涙，也和夏雨一般；祗要伊心靈中有些不快，受了些外界剌激，成者是肉體上有點小病，伊們的眼涙都會像夏雨般狂流的’伊們爲要發洩藴藏在内心的悲哀，和肉體上的痛苦，這像夏雨般狂流眼涙，便是女人唯一的方法了！</p>
<p>至於説到我們男人的眼涙，它是像冬天的雨一般，是不肯輕易落下來的，雖然有時也許要灑下幾點英雄之涙，這不是説，男人是没有内心的悲哀，和肉體上的痛苦的，祗不過男人比較女子容易忍受，容易比較女子譬得開，即使一時實在難忍受，同時又譬不開，這在悲痛到極點的時候，往往更流不出眼涙來的，因爲這時的眼涙大多已化成血和力了，剩下一些些的眼涙也不自外流而由肚中吞嚥了！</p>

<p>頗承不棄，鄧錫侯覆電來了。覆電的措詞，實在不壞，極盡文字技巧之能事</p>
<p>。他説：『素欽貴會關懷國難，力弭内爭：錫侯素來酷愛和平，恥辱内戰。現愈退讓，而劉文輝愈益進迫、致全軍債極難退：當此國事垂危，彼竟罔顧一切！諸公和平福星，高呼四應，務祈對於無端興戎者，速作有效制裁之主張，以申公理。『原來他是很欽佩關懷國難的貴會，而又是酷愛和平，恥辱内戰，但因對方進迫，全軍纔憤極難遏，他是不負責任的。他不但不負責任，並且把責任加到貴會諸公，要求有效制裁，以申公理。貴會如無有效制裁，那便於他無干，是貴會不盡責之故，貴會便不應再請他息爭。實在妙極，我們倒要看看劉文輝覆電如何。推想起來，劉又何嘗不懂得文字技巧，也許劉的措詞，比鄧更妙，因爲這已是四川軍閥的拿手傑作。總之，説來説去，他們都不會錯，其錯實在於中國有那麽一片天府之國，可以關門唱戲的四川土地！</p>
<h3 id="c243">摩登無國難 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 顧臥佛</p>
<p>『國難』，當然不是個人的，或少數</p>
<p>人的，凡是中國的人，以及中</p>
<p>國一切的一切，都給這個國難當頭鎭壓着，『救國』，就是給這國難當頭鎭壓出來的一種呼聲！但是，事情偏有例外的，在中國的『摩登』，就無有國難，國難，也不會光臨到它丨摩登丨的頭上，摩登無國難，所以也根本不需救國。</p>
<p>摩登跳舞場，摩登的影戲院，摩登</p>
<p>的咖啡館，以及出賣摩登的公司，發揮摩證的機關，竞攙摩登的塲合，憑你是千里眼，順風耳，也不會給你在這方面找出一些國難的粒屑，就是無孔不入，有洞即攢的國難，到了這些摩登所在地，也要望洋興嘆，逡巡而退。此外，還有一個鐵一般的證據：</p>
<p>申報特派員賡雅在『戰區見聞記』中</p>
<p>有一段説：『：歸見副官處勒務兵正裝箱收拾行李，怪而問之：始悉軍部行將喬遷某處，記者倉猝出城，月色清凄，爲之黯然！時有嬌小玲瓏的摩登婦女，相伴爭行於沙途間，旁有提箱荷篋之士兵隨行，料係官眷，持未敢確定耳』　這一段記：還不是『摩登無國難』的很好的説明嗎？我們且漫管伊是不是官長的官眷？但摩登終於是摩登了。那末當頭的國難進展的雖然神速，可還那裏及得摩登的兩條肉腿跑的尤其神速，試問；敎它丨國難丨還有趕得上摩登的希望嗎？至於那些不摩登的呢？因爲不摩登，就只好讓國難迎頭痛撃，讓國難重重我團，還有什麽話可説？</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第七回　數語絶恩情閉門痛哭一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>那小林看到連長在家，作事是格外的殷勤，已是將幾盤冷</p>
<p>葷，先行端到桌子上來。趙自强向首席酒杯子裏，提着</p>
<p>壺，先斟下一杯，口裏先道：關大哥坐。這様一來，大家只有停止了談話，坐下來喝酒。趙翁父子先坐了主位，大家也就不能不坐下。趙翁舉起筷子，向各冷盤子裏指點了一陣和連道：請請請，我也並没有預備什麽好菜，不過大家聚會一下，取個樂兒。假使各位高興的話，不妨豁上幾拳。趙自强向趙翁微笑道：你又想閙一塲醉，何苦呢？這幾天，我心裏總是老不高興，聽説錦州丢了，槍子兒没放出去一個，又丢掉一大區國土。走到外面去總聽到人説，你們東北軍，抗着槍桿總是向後轉的，我就氣得死去活來。我不是個師長，也不是個旅長，我有什麽法子。若是我至少是個團長，我也要帶了一團人和日本見個高下。縱然説我違抗軍令，至多也不過拿我去槍斃，有什麽了不得。殷得仁端了酒杯子，昻頭一飲而盡，放下酒杯子，又用手按了一按，表示他那十分沉着的様子，望了趙自强道：你這話對的。我是什麽也不怕，無論作什麽，只求幹個痛快丨海闊天空，我就是一個大人，無論要幹什麽，我也敢放了手去幹番。你不像我，還有個老太爺呢。趙自强聽了這話，偷眼看了趙翁一下，不敢再説什麽。趙翁右手端了杯子，左手擰着幾根長鬍子，微微的笑了一下道：你不覺得我説這話是假話，我就説了。拿兒子去當兵，那就是把兒子送給國家的一件事。不瞞諸位説，我自小兒，就好瞧個鼓兒詞，可是哥兒姐兒的那一套，我不愛瞧，什麽精忠傳啦，三國演義啦，七俠五義啦，最是對我的勁，我總想讓自强轟轟烈烈幹一番，别的我倒是不掛慮。（八○）</p>
<p>科學趣談</p>
<h3 id="c245">關於生物的種種 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 希農</p>
<p>我們都有這種經騐罷，女人，閒談是别具</p>
<p>『功夫』的。他們只要找着了（他們會很</p>
<p>容易地找着了）一個對手（這對手當然大都是同性，）便便一應一和地嘮嘮叨叨説個不清，自東家阿貓會一直説到西家阿狗，雖接連談上兩三個鐘頭，亦豪不覺厭倦。這，而且似乎中外古今皆然，不獨是敝中國的女人如此，究竟女人爲什麽會這様喜歡説話呢？據德國兩位生理學家的研究説，女人的聲帶要較男子的爲輕，故特别易振動而發生音波云。這倒是有趣的發見。</p>
<p>皮膚的功用，我們都知道，一方面保護肌肉</p>
<p>與器官，一方面更兼營呼吸與排洩作用：但據新近的研究，它尙内含一種殺菌的質素，故除上述的效用外，還有一種直接防止傳染病侵入的功用。據實騐，倘吾人將細菌如傷寒菌等放到皮膚上去，它要於瞬間撲滅細菌全部的百分之九十以至九十五。不過此種功用與皮膚的清潔成正比例，倘太齷齪了，便將完全失其作用。</p>
<p>我們通常都可以觀察到鳥獸的毛羽，雖不經</p>
<p>什麽膏或什麽水的塗潤，但畢竟是多麽整齊與光滑，並不如人的頭髮須要時間，金錢，耐心，經過一番手續纔能獲得暫時的整齊與美觀。同様是毛，爲什麽天賦與人者獨薄呢？近據德國科學家愛克司納氏的研究，原來其間亦有電的作用在。蓋如鳥類，毛與羽排列極密，因它們的相互磨擦，便發生了電，細毛爲隂極，羽爲陽極，獸類雖無毛羽之别，但亦有粗細之分，粗毛卽发鳥獸羽，負陽電，細毛反之負隂電，根據異性相吸的原理，便現爲整齊與光滑：但同時，因細毛間的異性相拒，細毛遂得平均展布於週身，故此種電的作用，對於鳥獸有兩重意義，一是因細毛的蓬鬆，體温不致消散，一是因羽毛的滑澤，雨水及其他有害物得不易侵入。至人的頭髮完全爲清一色，無分粗細，故磨擦的結果，只能生同性的電極，而互相排擠。這，亦就是頭髮在乾燥時，不易梳直，待用水濕潤，將電導去以後，卽易梳整齊的原因。　　兒童的長大，一般人俱以爲與時日與營養成正比例，詎知據近哈來大學敎授朗蓋氏所發表的研究，事實竟有出人意外者，蓋兒責因不特與營養良好與否有關，並且亦受季候之重大影響。朗氏曾就育婴院中健康兒童先後作關於體長與體重的測量各二次，結果發見體重的增加可因其增加之遲速分作三期：二歲的兒童最速是九月至十二月間，最緩是五月至八月間，正月至四月比較平均，較大的兒童（自三歲至六歲）則以六月至十一月間增長最快，五月次之，十二月至四月間最緩同時體長的增加則可分四期，以四月至七月最速，九月至十一月次之，八月更次之，十二月至三月間最慢。並且，無論大小的兒童，結果完全一様，不特同分四期，而且快慢順序亦毫無差異。</p>
<p>蚊子的可惡與爲害，可謂無人不知，固無庸</p>
<p>多説，但有效的驅除方法迄今人類所曉得的却很少。德人葛勒夫博士因欲覓得一種較有效的防禦方法，曾在熱帶地做過多次的試騐。他做了十七隻顏色不同的盒子，内置誘蚊物品，擺在蚊子麕聚之處。結果，蚊子大都聚集在深藍色的盒子裏，猩紅，深灰，黑暗色的俱很少，白，紫，緑，等色的更少，黄色的則一隻都没有，幾次的試騐，都是如是。由此可知蚊是不喜黄的顏色，或是没有黄色的感覺的，我們卽可利用此來防護蚊子，如窗帘，帳子，燈光等俱不妨改爲黄色一試。</p>

<h3 id="c271">胡調 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>爲適應時代之需要’我曾經想組織一個胡調公司’替社會上各方面服務。不曾组織成功是</p>
<p>很可惜的’否則在跳　救國唱戲救國遊藝救國經懺救國乃至展覽會救國等盛大運動中’大可帮忙’也出風頭。並非我説那些事項’完全屬於胡調’我要主張’胡調也可以是救國之端。</p>
<p>這分明不是指胡適之博士的救國調子’更不是胡蝶胡珊胡笳萍等電影明星’也不是胡琴</p>
<p>胡鼓等樂器的調子’胡調只不過是上海話中的胡調而已。胡調的特色在於莫明其妙’昏沉沉混呴呴’而表面上却熱閘非凡’十分體面’極其像煞有介事。最妙的是做的人’明知其不可爲而爲之’明知其没其功效’也硬了頭皮去幹’有不可及的氣槪。開頭確有佛説我不入地獄誰入地獄的大無畏精神’結果的弄到一塌胡塗’却不能怪他。</p>
<p>從來論事跡的善惡’要看動機’以成敗論英雄的’是勢利小人的行動’胡調的結果自然是成功少而失敗’但這並不妨其爲善行。况且救國之道多端’倘若大家主張自已所唱導的是惟一的救國之道’那一定會閙到國未救得而内爭已起’那是頂坍台的’於是胡調就不可少了。胡調也者’無往而不和’無往而不同調也’人云亦云’隨聲附和’是胡調之特長’亦步亦　如影隨形’也是胡調之特色。而且還有是超越過了附和倣行的範圍而向前勇進的’他們可以没有目標計劃而行軍出師’没有準預想而執行事務’那勇往之氣’實非常人所能及。　　勇往是勇往了’但並不熱烈’倘使此路不通’可以另走一條’那也是隨便走的’並不要什</p>
<p>麽選擇。一點的執着心也没有’極圓混通脱之能事’因爲本來是没有整個的預定計劃’所以怎様改也不關緊要’而胡調的容易過日子’也就在這裏了。他們終天是樂觀的’什麽事情都有解救辦法的’而結果是無有一事不大糟其糕的。胡調是胡塗的弟兄輩。</p>
<p>胡調’决不會有鮮明的態度’而且也不許有’因爲那天生是漠糊暗昧的’事務像在進行又像是停頓’態麽像肯定又像是否定’非等到了無可挽救的時候’胡調永遠不會失敗’而到了那時候’不是胡調也要失敗的。説起來’那是一種衰老的暮氣’中國民族已瀕衰老之境’什麽地方都是特别多胡調’而今而後’治國救國’也非胡調不成其爲大計了。嗚呼！</p>
<h3 id="c272">洞庭與西子 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 幸之</p>
<p>我生長在洞庭’然而從小時’我便</p>
<p>震於西湖的大名。每讀『欲把西湖比西子’淡妝濃抹總相宜之句’小小的心靈裏’便憧憧着一個絶代佳人的麗影’反映出一個明媚秀麗的西湖。</p>
<p>離開的鄉已經六七年了’那八百里</p>
<p>湖天一色的洞庭’真令我夢想爲勞。然而在去年秋天’我却去訪問過久所慕念的西湖’我依偎在西子的懷裏’雖説只有短短的三天’但我已看到了晴快的西子’看到了隂鬱的西子’也看到了雨後的西子。我真得感謝天’爲我這様周詳的打算。</p>
<p>西子真是艷麗極了’那是一個東方</p>
<p>美人的典型’晴快時是那様的明媚’隂鬱時是那様的嚴肅’而雨後則又如浴罷美人’輕羅籠罩’益增其愛媚。在遊罷西子之後’我不自禁的發出『故鄉無此好湖山』的感嘆。</p>
<p>然而説’故鄉無此好湖山’究竟</p>
<p>是唐突了洞庭丨誰能説洞庭不好呢？不過洞庭的好’是另一種典型’如果我們説西子是美人’那麽洞庭便可以説是英雄。因爲洞庭是壯麗的’不是妍麗的’是雄偉的’不是明媚的’那裏没有舞弄春風的楊柳’也没有呢喃輕囀的鶯兒’只有拍天的巨浪’亘古地怒吼着不平的歌曲’狂濤滚滚東逝’捲去千古今流人物’那裏没有少男少女輕舟蕩漾’纒綿絮話’只有巨艦馳驟’黑烟騰空而蘆葦深處’更多江湖好漢’叱咤風雲。對着那天水相接浩渺無垠的湖波’和那烟霧籠罩變幻莫測的景色’使人只能正襟遥睇’肅然凝眸。天老是那様的空’湖老是那様的闊’你就想讚美’也找不出一句適當的頌辭來。范仲淹秀才在岳陽樓記中對洞庭的頌辭是；『環遠山’吞長河’浩浩蕩蕩’渾無際涯’朝暉夕隂’氣象萬千』我想’這還是不足以狀洞庭之雄偉與壯麗。</p>
<p>西子’究竟是艷麗的’惟其艷麗’</p>
<p>所以人得而玩弄’環湖路上’汽車滚滚’寳叔塔下’紅樓掩映’一切的達官貴人’傖俗市僧’都懷着千金買笑的心情’向西子的懷裏擠’湖中船多如鯽’紅男緑女’管弦笙歌’微風起處’湖水也泛起金色的媚笑’是已經披上一件資本主義的大衣了’已經成爲一個蕩婦了’已經没有那種自然而真樸的美了’這較之洞庭之只可遠觀而不可以褻玩’西子又該顧影自憐黯然失色罷。</p>
<p>洞庭湖中有君山’蒼翠一點’恰像</p>
<p>水晶盤裏的青螺’山上有朗吟亭’聽濤閣’有娥皇女英的墓’有柳毅曾由此下海爲龍女下書的井’有涙痕狼藉的斑竹’岳陽樓隔岸雄峙’肅然相對’湖邊漁歌抑揚’漿聲欵乃’那真是一幅天然的畫圖’是美’是善’是真。</p>
<p>離開洞庭已經七年了’爲問故鄉的</p>
<p>沙土與塵泥’是否已掩埋了我青春踐踏的足跡？翹首西顧’輒深悵惘丨寄語湖光山色’他日湖山無恙’我當重來。五月二十四寫於上海’</p>
<h3 id="c273">小土豪 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>這是出乎我意外的高興’當淑榮引我走進一座雅潔的小洋樓時我真</p>
<p>不相信在龍岩還能見到這様的房子。</p>
<p>『喂’龍岩怎麽有這麽好的房子？』</p>
<p>『這要感激這位房子的主人土豪劣</p>
<p>紳』。她帶着滑稽的口吻微笑着回答我</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>『呵’原來是土豪劣紳的’難怪這</p>
<p>麽漂亮。』</p>
<p>雖然説漂亮’其實拿上海的洋房子</p>
<p>比起來’這只能當做破碎不堪的厠所看待了。這房子雖然有兩層’建築的形式有點歐化’可是因了軍隊的破壞’門和窗户欄杆等通通没有了’壁上寫滿了各種各様的標語’淑榮來到時才做了兩扇房門’可是窗户仍然没有’只用兩張大紙糊上那個大窟　。</p>
<p>『這怎麽能通空氣呢？』當淑帶我到</p>
<p>她給我預備的房子去時’我進門就大呌了起來’原來漂亮的房子只是一個繡花枕頭。</p>
<p>『嘿’你還嫌牠不通空氣’這様好』</p>
<p>的房子在龍岩呈找不出第二家的’你不要輕視牠’真正不通空氣’没有光線’老百姓們住的房子你看了一定會嚇死呢。』</p>
<p>。　。聽了淑的話我只能伸伸舌頭’不由</p>
<p>得我不滿意’連忙將舗蓋堆在床板上；望到只有一塊破板子四只脚支持着的没有抽屜的桌子我又失望起來。</p>
<p>『你知道這張桌子費了多少力才從』</p>
<p>他們辦公廳裏借來的嗎？』淑似乎看出了我的心事’所以很細心地爲我解釋。我自然很感激她’這様四壁蕭條的屋子　　　　　時的家　專滿他　　　　　爲我借了兩條凳來’否則進門就只得罰立正。</p>
<p>第一次看見那個兩只眼睛死死地釘</p>
<p>住我看的婦人’她微笑着向淑招呼’淑告訴了她我今天才從漳州來。</p>
<p>『這女人是誰？』我有點奇怪淑和她</p>
<p>講話的神氣怪親　親似的。</p>
<p>『就是房子的主人’土豪劣紳的老</p>
<p>婆。』</p>
<p>『她的丈夫呢？』</p>
<p>『躱到厦門去了’還没有回來。』</p>
<p>『她還有財産嗎？』</p>
<p>『没有了’她的田通通拿來分給農』</p>
<p>民了’别的東西一點也没有’現在她真可憐’一個十歲的女孩子天天挑煤’兩個男孩子太小了’只能吃飯’因此她近來的生活一天天陷於窮困了。』</p>
<p>『這是土豪劣紳應有的結果。』</p>
<p>『咧’這就是她最小的兒子’你看』</p>
<p>他的相多凶多蠢’兩個大眼睛像老虎眼一般那種愚。蠢呆板的表情’又像猪一般令人討厭。』</p>
<p>察站在我旁邊的小士豪’的確他的兩只眼睛特别大’簡直像牛眼一般’可是從眼裏射出來的光是死灰的’遲灣的’愚蠢而令人討厭的。小航告訴我無論護問他什麽他總要立正回答’而且特别有精神。比方問他『你吃過飯没有？』『吃過了！』</p>
<p>『你不要站在這裏！』『是的！』他的语氣和態度完全像士兵對待上級官長一般’真有趣味。（未完）</p>

<p>— ＪＵＬＥＳＫＥＮＡＲＡ作林取譯</p>
<p>紅頰　二（續）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚又窺伺了很久。他害怕威奥龍再突然跑回來，瑪梭却早已縮做一團，把被窩蒙頭</p>
<p>蓋上，可是他並没睡着，他在回憶着剛才那莫明其妙的事變。他並没有看出這事情裏面有什麽可以使得他痛苦的壞處，在暗黑的被中，威奥龍的面影明明白白地浮在他的眼前，這面影正和常常在夢中使得他興奮的那些女人的面影一般温柔。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚懶得再等了。他的眼臉像感着磁氣似的合攏起來。他强迫自已把眼睛睜開瞧着那捻得很小的煤氣燈：但當那些發着聲聲的從燈嘴裏擠出來的小氣泡出現三個之後，他便睡熟了。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>第二天早上，大家　着洗臉盆，把揩面巾的一角浸在一點點冷水裏面，輕輕地擦着那感覺寒冷的顴骨時，紅蘿蔔鬚很兇的望着瑪梭，並且盡力使自已　着野蠻的様子，他父咬緊牙齒，尖聲地辱駡他：</p>
<p>『兎子！兎子！』</p>
<p>瑪梭的雙頰漲得通紅，但他還很和氣地回答他，並且差不多帶着乞憐的眼光：</p>
<p>『我旣然對你説並没有那回事，你還閙什麽呢！』</p>
<p>監學先生來查看他們的手有没有洗乾凈。學生分做兩排站着，機械般地把手伸出，先是手</p>
<p>背，隨後很快地把手新翻過來，又馬上縮回去放在暖和的地方。丨挿在自已的衣袋裏，或是塞在近處床上微温的鴨毛被中。平常，威奧龍是並不細看的，但今天，事不凑巧，他發現紅蘿蔔鬚的兩手没有洗乾凈。被吩咐再到自來水龍頭上去洗一洗的紅蘿蔔鬚，心裏不服起來。實在説，他的手上是有一點青色汚點的，可是紅羅蔔鬚固執地説這是凍瘡的先兆。别人一定對他有私怨。</p>
<p>威奥龍祇得把他送到院長先生那裏。</p>
<p>起得很早的院長先生，正在他那糊着暗淡的緑色壁紙的辦公室裏，預備一課趁着自已有閒</p>
<p>功夫時，敎給那些年紀大的學生的歷史功課。他把肥碩的手指使力的在桌面上點着，分出種種主要的階段：這兒是羅馬帝國的衰落；中間是土耳其人侵入君士担丁堡；稍遠一點便是那不知從什麽時候起的講不完的近代史。</p>
<p>他穿着一件寛大的睡衣，堅挺的胸部總着幾道絲縧，就像一些繩索綑在石柱上面一様。顯然地，這位先生吃得太多；他臉上的紋路粗而微微發光。他説話的聲音很大，和女太太們説話時也是一様；他頸根上的縐摺在他那硬領上迂徐而有音律的波動着。還有他那圓大的兩眼和那兩撇濃密的鬍鬚也是很觸目的。</p>
<p>紅纙蔔鬚站在他面前，把帽子取下放在兩腿之間，以便保有着動作的自由。</p>
<p>院長以一種可怕的聲音問道：</p>
<p>『什麽事？』</p>
<p>『先生，監學先生説的兩手没有洗乾凈，把我送來這裏，但這事是冤枉的！』</p>

<h3 id="c276">亞當與夏娃 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>聖經上的亞當夏娃’與中國歷史上的盤古氏’同一荒誕而無稽’是否有其</p>
<p>人與有其事’至今尙爲疑問’不料前日路透電傳’土耳其消息’説土耳其人’現新發明亞當夏娃’確係産生於該地’因爲從『家』字和『年代』上作種種考據’亞當夏娃’决定爲土耳其人’猶如姓周的定要去認文王爲老祖’姓姜的定要去認太公爲本家’同一可笑’但亞當夏娃是否承認我未敢説此事只得擱起不談且去問了亞當夏娃再講。</p>
<p>二十一日路透社哈爾濱電’謂此地裸體生義之倍徙等’最近成一俱樂部’　　名之曰『亞當與夏娃』’第一次大會’係在克雷士特夫斯基舉行’並在該島</p>
<p>作裸體日光浴’歷時三句鐘之久云云</p>
<p>贊成得很’亞當夏娃’本是不穿褲子的男女’又是原人時代的老祖’日光</p>
<p>浴自經外國發明後’各地頗爲風行’去年香港’亦有這様的組織’中外士女都有’不過外國女子’尙怕羞恥’雖加入而不實行’惟中國女子加入者’甚爲踴躍’在這一點上看來外國女子文明得不澈底中國女子文明得澈底就把近年中國的女子來講’婚姻絶對自由’摩登的服裝’天大在那裏變化’三千的煩惱絲’亦剪得一乾二凈’這様花様翻新都是頭頭是道在這許多行爲上都可以看得出中國女子文明的程度。</p>
<p>不過此次哈爾濱亞當與夏娃會』’是否有中國女子加入’因電傳不明’未敢臆斷’但照事實來講’恐不無中國女子參與其間’蘇俄本來是共産國’非但共産’而且共妻’婚姻制度’早已完全打倒’不過在某種情形之下’只要對方同意’就可作短時間的夫婦’所以裸體與不裸體本來不成問題’但是中國尙有一些夫婦制度的約束於自由之中還有一些不自由所以中國人喜歡日光浴’俄國人天然贊同’即區區亦决不反對’其理由有二’</p>
<p>（二）文化的進展’本來是還原式的’從前的生活’一天舒適一天’現在的</p>
<p>生活’一天困難一天’從前的文化’一步一步的進展’現在的文化’一步一步的寰退’即其他一切的一切’無不如是’這都是還原式的表演’故孟子曰’人之所以異於禽獸者幾希’理學家註曰’幾希少也可知人與禽獸本來無大差别再進一步言人亦不過是禽獸之一則禽獸裸體人亦何嘗不可以裸體呢。</p>
<p>（二）總理不是曾經説過麽？人生的最大要素’就是衣食住行’而衣又居四</p>
<p>大要素之首’當然’衣食問題最難解决倘然大家不穿衣服’豈非省了許多麻煩’省了無數經濟’暑天的華而紗’冬天的錦地縐等等’多用不着’四大要素之中第一件要素就可不生困難世間多是不着褲子的男子和女人豈不有趣</p>
<p>我根據上述兩種理由’所以極端贊成『亞當夏娃主義』’本來現在風行赤足</p>
<p>而不穿襪子最爲時髦倘若連褲子而不穿豈非更加時髦麽？亞門’</p>

<p>— 懷樁</p>
<p>不幸的事件’終究臨着敏兒了’她</p>
<p>慈愛的父親和母親都棄掉了這可愛的小鳥兒’意獨自的升到天國裏去’於是’這撫養的責任’當然’祇有歸於她的叔父來担承。</p>
<p>『敏兒』’當敏兒她叔父家的第四天’他的叔母就督促着她説『你已經是</p>
<p>十五歲了’還儘是這様的愛玩’你没有看見隔壁王家姆媽的女兒媽？她’十三歲的人’一早起來’就楷桌子’抹窗’整被掃地’那一様她不會整理’日間有空的時候’還要拿着棚子學繡花哩丨</p>
<p>『像你：：：』她叔母用手指着她’繼</p>
<p>續的説’語氣似乎還要加重些’並且從她的臉龐上可以看出’含有不屑的神氣『哼！不是和她天差地嗎？』</p>
<p>還有對面好婆也説過’現在的女人</p>
<p>家’真是笑話’一天到晚’不知在那裏做些什麽事情’祇是把吊膀子的本領’到學會了許多丨唉丨真天曉得丨將來到婆家去的時候’眞不知要吃怎様的苦呢！</p>
<p>敏兒’你現在不聽我的話’將來’</p>
<p>假使没有人家來娶你’那可别要怪我’她叔母的語氣比較和綫些’隨後’又指着放在灶片間倚靠着牆壁的煤球爐説『乖些。快把這煤球爐子生起火來’等會’你的借姊（她自已的女兒）起身的時候’就可早些到學校裏去説吧’</p>
<p>經過半小時的試念’敏兒終於失敗</p>
<p>了，烏黑的煤屑沾染在她的兩手如臉龐間，一面她的眼涙，也因爲煤氣的緣故，而落下來了，可是她的叔母，却還頻頻地駡她「笨蟲」哩。</p>
<p>八點半，倩姊才從她粉紅色的夢中醒來，因爲今天煤爐生得慢，湯水還没有燉好’只儘是在坐牀沿上發怒。</p>
<p>『倩兒』敏兒的叔母説『我的乖乖你</p>
<p>不要生氣這都是敏兒的不好’等會’我要結實的駡她』頓她一面説着’一面俯下　去替她女兒去扣未曾連結的衣　’輕微地和緩地説着『你的印度綢旗袍在中飯前可以做好了’這下半天就好可同對過的媛媛去看電影並且你的蔻丹用完了’順便也可以買來’</p>
<p>『快些丨起來’不要生氣吧丨』</p>
<p>倩姊的怒氣有些平復了索性倒在牀</p>
<p>上撤嬌着説：『那’我高跟皮鞋呢？』</p>
<p>『那雙高跟皮鞋嗎？放心吧丨早已』</p>
<p>呌你父親去買了』</p>
<p>這時’倩姊的嬉笑和敏兒的啜泣’</p>
<p>不自流地已成了人生的交響曲。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>十五　角逐</p>
<p>第二天清晨的絶早’柳姑娘睡眼惺忪的吻着文彬的前額’無限柔情的摩着</p>
<p>他的緋紅的面腮’很流露了一點纏綿的愛意。但是睡在她懷里的仍然是沉沉的睡着’於此可知’這一夜確實有説不盡的濃厚的恩愛。其後柳姑娘突然明白起來’知道他不便再在自已牀上沉睡了’於是便决心喊醒他了。當他醒來再緊緊的抱住她的時候’她説；</p>
<p>『可憐的孩子’你現在可以走了。』</p>
<p>『什麽？你敎我走？』</p>
<p>『是的’孩子丨因爲現在已經是你必須離開這裏的時候了。固然我十分懂』</p>
<p>得我很需要你的體温’你的擁抱’但是你也得知道’現在我還不能完全委身給你’事實上我必須侍候着其他比你還要重要的男人。親愛的’你懂得嗎？我是真心誠意的在愛着你的哩」。</p>
<p>當然’在張文彬是免不了要很不高興的’但是經不住她温情的勸誘’還不是懶洋洋的走出她的房門。不過總得走回來問她一句；</p>
<p>『那末你現在又打算接待誰呢？』</p>
<p>『這個你又何必過問呢？』她微着説：一親愛的’我告訴你’我的事你也用</p>
<p>不着擔心、你現在安心回去罷’好好的睡一會兒’靜靜的等着我的命令’祇要是方便的時候’也許明天晚上又可以會面。總之’請你相信我’我從來就没有像愛你這様的去愛過其他的男人。我覺得這是你最大的勝利。』</p>
<p>自他走後’顧經理來過一次電話’説是早上因有事不能來了’準定晚上再來看她。這一天柳姑娘總沉醉在甜蜜的回憶中。也許這便是她幸運的開始吧。不過無論如何’她現在總算得了一種新的剌激’雖然這種愛情使她過分的不安’似乎她的心靈給這個新來的男人迷惑了。</p>
<p>直到晚上屋子裏又點上了電燈’銀行經理顧先生又在努力灌着她香檳的</p>
<p>時候’她從新體認着自已的生活’她終於還在賤賣着自已的生命。然而顧經理這時却是盡情的淘醉’這是她非常清楚的。</p>
<p>其後門外一陣汽車的喇叭聲’只聽得武貴在另一間屋子裏呌喊着；</p>
<p>『誰開門去’又有客人來啦！』</p>
<p>接上荷香走近柳姑娘身邊’輕輕的説了幾句’於是她對着顧經理看一眼</p>
<p>’笑着説：</p>
<p>『這有什麽呢？你領她上這兒來罷’反正大家都是認識的。』</p>
<p>『誰？誰來？』顧經理問：</p>
<p>『馬上就會來的’你等着瞧罷。』</p>
<p>一會兒蘇部長穿得滿身簇新的走進來’經理立刻站起來大聲嚷道：』</p>
<p>『哦’原來是你啊’好極了’好極了’請坐請坐。：喂’敎他們再拿一個』</p>
<p>酒杯來罷。』</p>
<p>『真的’想不到我們在這裏也會碰面’』蘇部長坐下來’説着’向柳姑娘偷</p>
<p>偷的看了一眼’再很漂亮的問候着顧經理：『真是好極了’想不到我們能够在這裏談談。顧先生也常時到這裏走動走動嗎。</p>
<p>『不’今天我還是和楊小姐第一次會面哩。』</p>
<p>『噢？：：我也是的’我還是咋天才認識她啊。』</p>
<p>『那末你比我還多有一天的交情了。』</p>
<p>彼此都恨聰明’彼此都相信自已善於辭令’祇有柳姑之大聲笑了起來’立刻又摯起酒杯呻了一口。不幸却引起一陣强烈的咳嗽。大槪是酒汁流進了氣管的原故’這强烈的咳嗽一時不能遏止’直到跑進臥房看見痰孟裏又浸着血絲的時候’少不了一面揩着眼涙’深深的嘆着氣。不過這時候外面的兩位中國的巨頭’她相信一定是談得十分投機的吧。</p>

<h3 id="c283">在大光明公演的『琴心波光』 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 志翔</p>
<p>喧傳已久的啞劇『琴心波光』於二十一日在大光明戲院公演。該劇可算是中</p>
<p>國戲劇與交響音樂的初次携手。以公演的成績而論’可説是成功。</p>
<p>是晚的節目共分三節。第一節是中國古樂。先由大同音樂會奏東方大樂；該會蜚聲社會已久’這一次參加盛會實覺雙方生色不少。其次是衛君的琵琶獨奏。此君手法純熟而所奏『淮隂平楚』一曲更是音調鏗鏘’博得聽衆的掌聲不少。</p>
<p>第二節是作曲家阿父夏洛穆夫的交響樂作品。先由劉經方夫人唱阿氏所作的『睛雯絶命曲』。歌詞係朱曼華先生編的’詞意很悱惻。可惜劉夫人唱時’聽衆但聞其聲’不辨她唱的是何句何字。這大槪是因爲她没有受過充分的中國唱法的訓練’口腔的動作不合規則’所以念字吐音’不能清晰。至於該曲的音樂方面’也許據西方人聽來是很凄諒的’但由中國人聽來雖也似乎感到悲哀’然而還不能引起纒綿悱惻如泣如訴的感覺。這大槪是中西音樂對於發揮情緒’各有不同的緣故吧！</p>
<p>歌唱之後’就是阿氏所作的『北平胡同印象記』一曲。在這一曲由中’把北方剃頭匠所用的大音叉以及鑼鈸等加入西音弦樂’一同奏演’很爲特色。使人可以從音樂中感想到北平胡同生活的一斑。奏畢時掌聲四起’可見聽衆是很感動的。</p>
<p>休息之後’梅蘭芳上臺介紹『琴心波光』一劇’作簡短的演説’由某君翻譯。然後樂隊開始奏樂’幕向兩邊拉開。佈景是宫殿和湖的一岸’光線和色調都不錯。全劇以仙姝舞蹈一場最爲精采。仙姝由袁美雲女士扮演’姿勢很優美’無法極純熟’與音樂的節奏’絲絲入彀’所以舞畢時四座掌聲雷動’都很滿意。其他演員中以扮琴師者爲最好。其餘亦尙稱職。該劇係啞劇’一切動作言語表情’都以音樂摹寫’實在是很不容易的。我們雖不能説這種嘗試是盡善盡美’但也很滿意了。這是中國舊劇的一條新途徑’很有發展的可能。希望將來還有歌劇的嘗試’那末對於中國舊劇的改良’更近一步了。</p>

<h3 id="c284">評『苦肉計』 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 忠</p>
<p>近兩年來康絲登裴納ＣＯＮＳＴＡＮＣＥＢＥ</p>
<p>ＮＮＥＴＴ出品的多’成績的優良’真呌人有些驚奇了。我們再來看一看國泰映的</p>
<p>這張苦肉計（ＴＷＯＡＧＡＩＮＳＴＴＨＥＷＯＲＩＤ）</p>
<p>’這是她替華納公司演的。她從前在銀</p>
<p>幕上’總是扮一位天真活潑的女郎’或者是一位熱戀賢能的少婦’但是迂迴難作風依然’她竟變了一位聰明幹練飽知世故的女郎了。可以稱得一聲『能者無不能』的批語。</p>
<p>故事我覺得有一點像情潮』ＴＥＳＳ</p>
<p>ＯＦＴＨＥＳＴＯＲＭＣＯＮＵＴＹ。表演呢’康絲登也有相似于珍妮蓋諾的地方。大槪説一個富家女的姊姊有了外遇’被她哥哥拿到了證據。她爲了要免去姊夫姊姊之間的破裂’所以自已去擔了不名譽的事。她哥哥大怒’去把她姊姊的情人殺死了；她去挽救’已來不及。法庭以爲這案子是她作的’她更蒙不白之冤。幸而她哥哥覺悟而自首了。一個少年律師又從中周旋。她又説出哥哥殺人的原因’法官以爲情有可原·不加以罪。她就和好律師結合了。</p>
<p>雖然有大團圓的結尾’但是除末一</p>
<p>節以外’很少談到戀愛的事；而專在家庭倫理上’作有力的描寫。比較是可取的’不過還有三個很大的漏洞：</p>
<p>第一：她哥哥所引爲憑據的手皮包</p>
<p>’旣是她姊姊的東西’她雖然承認了下來’而她姊夫居然絲毫不疑。豈有自已妻子的東西’平日行動’也一無所知。他是個傻子？第二：她姊姊有了不端行動’後來反若置身事外’毫無自譴或悲切的反響’也覺不合情理。第三：她旣然願意自甘代人受過’那未自承殺人好了。見律師，説明一切，大可不必。這一來和她以前原有意志有了矛盾了。　　演出時候又增加了一些漏洞。如手槍一聲，司閽人等不立刻入内：：等都應當導演負責的。還有一個大疑點：她哥哥所得的憑據，僅僅一隻手提包而已，而不認定這是不名譽及有暗昧，死之始甘，雖爲家聲，到底也覺失之於神經過敏，况且旣然自首了，手槍的腔膛，槍彈的式様，以偵探觀察力，很易判定殺人的證據。何致連法官都束手無策，必待女郎之自白始能定讞呢？導演更用極華麗的衣飾以表示女郎家庭之富有，不過這對於一位能幹賢德的女郎，却像加以一種辱汚了。富家女不一定每個都是窮奢極慾的啊！攝影光線分幕，都好。布景偉大，富有美感。華納爲這片子下的資本也就可觀了。别的地方，導演也還算努力，全片頗緊張。本事，意識，技巧，各方面雖有缺欠，但片子仍是超越的，康絲登表演的深刻，是她已往所没有的。她給觀衆不少情緒上的剌激。作律師的。ＮＥＩＬＨＡＭＩＬＴＯＮ盡力模倣一個清氣不定，浮燥好勝的青年，恰到好處。作哥哥的那個ＡＬＬＥＮＶＩＮＣＥＮＴ就略有火氣了，後半部却好些。飾妹妹的和一切其他演員都平平不足道。</p>

<p>麽呢？用着零零碎碎的短鏡頭’没有大的畫面。戰爭的塲面是假的’祇有極少數的正面衝突’有些地方簡直視戰爭爲兒戲’特别後半部的　囌的對話’沉悶的劇情’真有催眠的効力。不過却也有幾個美的鏡頭’如開始時旗艦破浪於滄茫大海之中’尤其是軍隊在夜間集中的時候’那巧妙的燈光’真是好極。然而導演畢竟是失敗的’前面無甚精采’中間僅有一個高潮’但又輕輕滑過。</p>
<p>關於佈景’砲台是假的’很明顯地可以看出。旗艦上幾個曲部的裝置’再三再四的重覆。其他方面均屬平凡。</p>
<p>關於演員’我以爲没有一個是值得</p>
<p>誇奬的’只有那一個少佐的友人到還表現出了忠誠的個性。幾個女角都不佳。滑稽角色亦不能引人發笑。</p>
<p>而且即就故事的結構説’也就很有問題的。如少佐的呼救、居然那般巧合。少佐的推讓大功。也是不大説得通的。</p>
<p>總之’在任何方面’都是平凡有的而</p>
<p>不見持色’但也不是十分失敗。</p>
<p>最後’再説到我個人的感想。</p>
<p>像『氣壯山河』的譯名’自然是很動</p>
<p>人的’假如影片的内容把握住了弱小民族英勇的抗爭’勝利於極大的犧牲之中’那末這種題名才來得恰當。可是『ＴＨＥＦＩＡＧＬＩＥＵＴ』的内容’却是露骨的描寫帝國主義侵略殖民地’用一切最犀利的武器來鎭壓殖民地的反抗運動。我們在這暴兵深入而訂城下之盟的時候’看了這種片子’誰不觸目傷心？强暴者在一場屠殺之後而論功行賞’高擎勝利之杯’可是被侵略者却是死亡枕藉。假如最後顯在銀幕上的那面英國旗換成旭章的話’我們也能够心平氣服的而説這種侵略戰確是『氣壯山河』嗎？好不好加上一條中文字幕；『帝國主義萬歲』呢？</p>

<p>— 東林</p>
<p>採取童話爲題材利用五色的光彩</p>
<p>有人説：『自從發明有聲電影以來</p>
<p>’這有聲漫畫片已有最大的成功！」這句話’雖然有點過於武斷’但是亦很合理的。我以爲’凡是看過正片前有聲漫畫片的觀衆’必定都是同感的罷！我們可以從許多人’不爲法看正片’而特地去看漫畫片的’可以證明這話是不错的。那黑線和音節的調和’是何等的優美和幻妙啊！</p>
<p>然而’這有聲漫畫片的題材’往往不過是那些老鼠（ＭＩＣＫＹＭＯＵＳＥ）。此外從未見有任何新的發展’而且在内容方面’亦漸發現窮於應付之槪。那麽如這様的繼續下去’不是將要失去其聲價麽？在這種情勢下’而應運而起的’就是華德狄思耐的『滑稽交響曲』了。將童話搬到有聲漫畫片上來’以代替勢將堕落的老鼠片’是再有意義没有了。</p>
<p>可是富於引人入幻想的童話’僅以老鼠片裏的黑線表現’不是太勉强麽？因此五光色彩亦被利用了。在滑稽交響曲裏已被採取的；『海賊和人魚『』玩具的國』和『妖婆的森林』三篇内的『海賊和人魚』裏面’當人魚在海洋中游泳的一幕’塗上五顏六色的光彩’實在能够引人走進『童話之國』的幻境。據説’這三篇試映的成績’是很有希望的。</p>
<p>在不久的將來’我們在上海的影迷</p>
<p>們’亦將能看見這類新的有聲漫畫片。我們的眼福真不淺啊！</p>

<p>(Beiping) The situation took a turn yesterday. The Japanese side also announced that they would not enter Beiping and Tianjin. However, battles on all fronts have not ceased.</p>
<p>Peace negotiations are underway and a decision is expected soon. The authorities have stated that they will adhere to the central government's principle of negotiating while resisting, responding according to circumstances. Therefore, military defenses have not been relaxed. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The peace issue is advancing simultaneously on both military and diplomatic fronts. Diplomatic progress is closer. The British, French, American, and Dutch ambassadors,</p>
<p>, have been in discussions yesterday and today. The content concerns the Sino-Japanese situation in Beiping. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the ceasefire, this area remains tranquil. The number of Chinese troops stationed in the city is very small. The Chinese troops outside the city also do not appear to have any activity. Both sides seem to be creating a smokescreen regarding recent developments. According to unverified news, a Chinese staff officer, accompanied by two Japanese officers, went to Miyun today to inform the Japanese commander of the verbal agreement reached in Beiping. The tense situation in Beiping is gradually easing, and the number of people relocating is gradually decreasing. Japanese planes are still flying over Beiping and the surrounding area to observe the Chinese troops. This morning, seventeen planes flew over Tongzhou, conducting reconnaissance and dropping the same leaflets as during the first Japanese air raid on Beiping. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chinese and Japanese authorities here are still unwilling to disclose the terms of the ceasefire, and even less willing to acknowledge a compromise. However, there is mounting evidence to confirm such an agreement. The Japanese army has indeed stopped advancing, and the Chinese army is now quietly retreating to the designated line. Foreign military observers, although unaware of the content of the ceasefire, say that the current military position is consistent with the expected ceasefire. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning's stability in Beiping is unprecedented in recent days, as the ceasefire agreement yesterday has brought peace of mind. A certain Chinese news agency stated that fighting on all fronts ceased yesterday. However, Chinese newspapers still carry reports of battles and casualties. The Chinese army is now stationed on a line that runs approximately from Lutai, directly to Tongzhou, and then encircles the northeast sides of Beiping, about twenty miles from the city. The migration of residents in the city is gradually decreasing, and the ancient capital is returning to normal this morning. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A certain military agency spokesperson stated that recent reports that,</p>
<p>the Japanese Deputy Consul called on He to negotiate are completely untrue. Since Huang Laiping arrived, He has focused solely on military affairs and does not interfere in diplomacy. All diplomatic matters are handled jointly by Huang and Liu Chongjie. Even if he has opinions, he only offers them to Huang and Liu from the sidelines and never directly expresses anything to the outside world. In the past two or three days, although Japanese officials have visited He, he has not met with them and has asked them to negotiate with Huang and Liu instead. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Chen Chuxiong, head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Military Branch, on behalf of He</p>
<p>Yingqin, hosted a discussion with the press, stating: (1) In recent days, various newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin have often published military and diplomatic news that should have been kept secret and is inconsistent with the facts, which greatly affects the future and should be handled with caution. (2) The extra edition of the Beiping Evening News was published without inspection, which had a significant impact on diplomacy and military affairs. It was ordered to suspend publication for two days as a warning. (3) Today's North China Daily News reported that the British and French ambassadors were mediating a ceasefire, and that the Japanese Deputy Consul visited He. This is absurd. He has never interfered in diplomacy and has not contacted any parties. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu at Jurentang. Based on instructions from the Japanese government, they expressed a certain will. After they left at seven o'clock, the Chinese side convened an important meeting starting at nine o'clock. Huang Fu, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Jiang Bocheng, and various generals attended. As a result, it was deemed necessary to contact the Zhongshan secretary again. The Zhongshan secretary was notified by telephone, and at eleven o'clock in the evening, Zhongshan went to Jurentang again to negotiate with Huang and He, etc. The meeting lasted until one-thirty this morning before dispersing.

<p>(London) Today's Daily Express editorial expressed sympathy for China's</p>
<p>current deplorable situation, hoping that the League of Nations would take stronger action, lest it be too late. It stated that while the League of Nations is discussing security and armaments, a country in the Far East is forcibly imposing an alliance under duress. If the League of Nations' power does not extend to the Far East, then world peace will be in danger. Now is not too late, and the League of Nations can still ensure that peace is established legally. The Menchester Guardian's editorial, titled "Dishonorable Peace," stated that the Japanese army has achieved its robbery work with great skill and agility, but its leaders must know that they have given their diplomats difficult problems. Even if the Nanjing government tacitly acknowledges the existence of "Manchukuo," it will not collapse, but China may not recognize that this clause is binding. The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent said that if Nanjing had opened negotiations earlier, wouldn't China and the League of Nations have saved a lot of trouble? After all, China's petition to the League of Nations and the League of Nations' sympathy for China have ultimately not benefited China in any way. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese army authorities' assessment of the situation in North China</p>
<p>was released today as follows: Rumors of ceasefire negotiations between China and Japan are merely propaganda by those who want to take advantage of it. The Kwantung Army has not received any formal negotiations. The Kwantung Army is moving forward according to its established policy, without any changes, as has been stated repeatedly.

<p>(Beiping) The British Embassy categorically denies participating in North China peace</p>
<p>talks. It is heard that Chinese troops are retreating south along the railway. If the Japanese army gives the Chinese army a deadline to withdraw, hostilities will not be seen again. At noon today, Japanese soldiers arrived in Jiaomin Lane to reinforce the embassy guard. It is widely believed that more will come in the next few days, under the pretext of continuing to reinforce the embassy and maintain communication between the Japanese staff in Beiping and the Japanese army in the war zone.

<p>Street fighting once occurred within Ninghe City</p>
<p>The situation east of Tanggu is chaotic</p>
<p>(Beiping) At Jiangwakou, fifteen miles north of Ninghe on the morning of the 23rd, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers attacked our outpost. Our cavalry unit responded, and both sides held their ground until dusk, eventually repelling the Japanese army. This morning, about six or seven hundred Japanese soldiers, carrying a total of four or five field guns and mountain guns, and five or six mortars, launched a fierce attack on Ninghe, encircling it from three sides. Our □ division fought back for several hours, with two platoon leaders killed in action and one platoon leader wounded, along with more than twenty soldiers wounded or killed. The fighting was extremely fierce. The enemy then gathered civilian boats east of the river and used fierce artillery fire to cover the infantry's crossing of the river. Our troops were overwhelmed and retreated into the city, leading to street fighting. Due to heavy losses, our army gave way, and Ninghe fell into enemy hands. Our □ unit retreated to the west gate but did not counterattack. The Japanese side concentrated five or six thousand puppet troops in the area east of Ninghe, intending to seize Ninghe and control our Lutai. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All the Ninglu staff at Hangu Station north of the station retreated to Tanggu last night. The telegraph and telephone equipment at Hangu Station were dismantled. As of this morning, the situation east of Tanggu is unclear. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>retreated to the line of Nanfang Village, Beifang Village, and Anggezhuang. Our army still holds its ground. Part of the Japanese cavalry advancing westward from Longgezhuang via Dongliushui also retreated to the vicinity of Tongli. They did not advance this morning. Most of the enemy in Miyun are still in the county seat and the area south of it. There are more than ten tanks in the south gate. At Liyuanzhuang, west of Miyun City, there are four or five hundred Japanese soldiers. Japanese cavalry are sometimes seen in the Zhanggezhuang, Dapingzhuang, and Pingding Village areas. At Daxinzhuang and Dayancun, a large but unspecified number of Japanese troops are present. Several dozen Japanese infantrymen were found near Tangfushan, east of Hanxinzhuang. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Forty to fifty Japanese cars, full of infantry, arrived on the opposite bank of Lindian, disembarking at Xiji Town. The Japanese army built a bridge over the Jiangan River and used tanks to test the bridge's strength back and forth. The Japanese army at Baimiao has all retreated to the Beikui area. On the afternoon of the 22nd, about four or five hundred Japanese soldiers in Xianghe crossed the river at Lujiawu, southeast of Matou Town. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Most of our army □□ has concentrated towards Hangu. The Beining train still runs to Tanggu. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Discussing Ceasefire Gong <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>North China is now under the encirclement and threat of the enemy army. China and Japan have discussed a ceasefire. Although we do not yet know</p>
<p>what the conditions are at this time, it is undoubtedly true that this ceasefire is the first step in Sino-Japanese peace negotiations. Is this the final prelude to reconciliation, which will unveil the chaotic situation of neither war nor peace since the September 18th Incident last year?</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, we recognized that under the traditional land policy of Japanese imperialism,</p>
<p>there was absolutely no possibility of peace. Our government has repeatedly stated that it will not be subdued by force, preferring to be shattered like jade rather than preserved like tile. The people have also been running around calling for and insisting on resistance in order to fight for the survival of our nation. However, today we hear of negotiations and a ceasefire. The authorities have stated that they are trying to negotiate a ceasefire in the spirit of non-compromise and non-seeking peace. However, it may be very easy to find a path to understanding and an opportunity for peace within this non-compromise and non-seeking peace.</p>
<p>We believe that if peace can truly benefit the country, then peace is not impossible. The prerequisite for peace</p>
<p>is, at a minimum, first, that both sides must have sincerity in peace. Japan must abandon its deceptive behavior. Second, there must be preparations after peace, that is, we must have the determination to endure hardship and bide our time. However, based on the facts, when Japan first occupied Liaoning and Jilin, it stated that it would not attack Jinzhou, but soon attacked Jinzhou again. When it first occupied Jinzhou, it stated that it would not cross the Great Wall, but soon crossed the Great Wall again. Even after the signing of the Shanghai Agreement last year, Japan continued to attack Shanhaiguan, Rehe, and even Luanzhou, without stopping its aggressive actions because of the Shanghai Agreement. If Japan disregards credibility and progresses step by step in this way, can we expect it to have the sincerity to negotiate peace? Negotiations without sincerity are not only difficult to achieve peace, but even if peace is achieved, it is only a temporary state. As for being threatened by the force of a strong enemy, forced to endure humiliation, and bowing to an alliance under duress, there are often examples in the history of various countries. Take Germany and France as examples. During Napoleon's wars, Germany endured the pain of making peace and was able to rise again as a strong country. During the Franco-Prussian War, France was also in danger, but did not lose its status as a strong country. In the recent European War, the great powers forced Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles, but Germany today is still competing with the great powers. Another example is Goujian, the king of Yue in ancient China, who did not hesitate to bare his shoulders and lead a sheep to seek peace, and finally achieved the accomplishment of destroying Wu. Only by being able to rise again can one become strong, and only by having the spirit of enduring hardship and biding one's time can one endure the humiliation of baring one's shoulders and leading a sheep. However, looking back at the current situation in our country today, what is it like? For decades, our entire country has been lax, extravagant, and accustomed to idleness and extravagance, failing to seek progress, resulting in the current irreversible situation. When foreign troubles arise and the Japanese put extremely strong pressure on us, we say that we can be slightly more conscious. However, after the three northeastern provinces fell, our country remained lax. Even after Shanhaiguan was lost and Rehe was abandoned, it remained lax. Even recently, the enemy's cavalry crossed the Great Wall and approached Beiping and Tianjin, but our country still seemed to be unaware, singing and dancing as usual, seeking pleasure as usual. If the country is in such a serious crisis and does not realize it even when disaster is imminent, how can we say that we will be able to endure hardship and bide our time after peace is achieved? Without the determination to endure hardship and bide one's time, there is no hope of revenge and avenging humiliation. An alliance under duress will only bring shame and lead to destruction.</p>
<p>If we introspect ourselves and are not confident in the above two minimum prerequisites, then rather than shaming ourselves</p>
<p>today, it is better to go all out and fight. In such a situation, not making peace will inevitably lead to sacrifice, and making peace will not avoid sacrifice. However, the sacrifice of not making peace still has a glimmer of hope for survival, while the sacrifice of making peace will forever be unable to extricate itself. This is the advantage and disadvantage that our people should recognize.</p>

<p>(Washington) Japanese representative to the Washington Conference, Ishii Kikujiro,</p>
<p>told reporters here today that Japan believes the entire Sino-Japanese dispute, since the acquisition of Rehe, has concluded. The recent military activities are only protective measures and are not intended to expand the borders of "Manchukuo." He then simply stated that the Japanese army will not enter Beiping or Tianjin, but did not add any embellishments or explanations. He also said that there are no disputes regarding North China itself. The Japanese army's advance toward the Beiping area is not intended to force a solution to any disputes. He then hinted that he would be willing to discuss the overall Far East situation with President Roosevelt, but he did not explicitly state so. Ishii will have several informal talks with the US President in the US, discussing events such as tariffs, disarmament, international exchange rates, and silver. However, members of the Japanese delegation said that they hope the US President will mention recent developments in the Far East on his own initiative, giving Japan the opportunity to explain everything. The US President's application for disarmament and a new understanding of the definition of aggressors has opened a path to discussing the situation in the Far East. Ishii also said that the reason he did not publicly propose discussing the Far East situation was because, according to official reports, Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen did not discuss it in detail either. Several journalists then stated that it was rumored that some congressmen believed that President's request to stop military actions everywhere placed greater emphasis on Japan than on Germany and France. Ishii made no comment at first, but then said that he would like to explain Japan's position. Ishii's first talk with the US President will be at tomorrow's lunch at the White House, where it is heard that the two will first discuss the four major issues on the agenda of the economic conference.

<p>(Moscow) According to recent news obtained from here, the</p>
<p>terrifying state of the Chinese Eastern Railway remains unchanged. Manchurian and Japanese authorities continue to obstruct the normal operation of the railway through various means. Recently, there has been a new movement that threatens to further aggravate the situation. According to reliable sources, a meeting was recently held at the Japanese Embassy in Changchun, deciding to suspend the joint transportation of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway by the end of May. The purpose of this is twofold: first, to block all railway traffic to Vladivostok, diverting the original freight of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Dalian; and second, to undermine the operation of the Chinese Eastern Railway, thereby enhancing the Japanese position in negotiations to purchase the railway. Regarding the above news, the Soviet government gazette "Izvestia" commented today that although negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway are underway, and representatives of the Soviet Union, Japan, and Manchuria are also conducting negotiations in Harbin, aggressive elements in Manchuria continue their provocative activities to prevent the peaceful resolution of misunderstandings and conflicts arising from the railway. To achieve this goal, these provocateurs are creating new conflicts, keeping the relations between the two countries in a state of constant disputes. The obstruction of traffic in Vladivostok not only violates the Beijing and Shenyang agreements but also violates the agreement on the opening of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway. However, in order to avoid the accusation of violating the treaty, the Japanese in Changchun will disguise the next move to undermine the international railway agreement as a purely technical matter. However, if Japanese and Manchurian officials do not recognize the crudeness and provocative nature of this move and believe that it can reduce the price of purchasing the railway, then they are too naive." The newspaper concludes: "In our opinion, the main purpose of the Manchurian provocateurs is to obstruct, by all means, the negotiations to resolve all current disputes and the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, if Tokyo also participates in this plan, then Japan's failure to respond to the Soviet Union's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway has an explanation." (TASS Dispatch, 24th)</p>

The draft declares that the purpose of the consultation is (1) to exchange views in order to maintain peace and avoid team conflicts if the Pact of Paris is at risk of being violated; (2) to mediate and restore peace in the event of a violation of the Pact of Paris; (3) if peace cannot be restored, to determine who is responsible among the countries involved.

<p>(Geneva) France's acceptance of the British disarmament plan is subject to strict conditions. Today,</p>
<p>the representatives attending the General Committee all expect that there is little hope for an early agreement on the reduction of armaments. According to the conditions for France's acceptance of the disarmament part of the British plan proposed by French representative Peng Gu, (1) strictly manage international armaments and absolutely prohibit private arms manufacturing; (2) all offensive weapons should be handed over to the League of Nations, and France does not agree to destroy them; (3) conclude several European mutual assistance pacts to provide France with appropriate security; (4) standardize all war equipment and troops. It is also heard that unless the French are completely satisfied with all their demands, they are not even willing to try to accept the British plan. Therefore, the representatives all frankly stated that the French demands will be a major obstacle to reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>However, according to the French opinion, the</p>
<p>arms that have already been manufactured should be handed over to the League of Nations for management, so that they may be used to stop major wars someday in the future. Why destroy them? In addition, other items are also necessary for French security. However, no matter what else, the prohibition of private arms manufacturing alone is enough to hinder the establishment of a disarmament agreement, because this matter will become an economic issue. Since the government will not be able to order from private companies in the future, it will have to manufacture itself. However, many countries will feel that it is difficult to complete the equipment for manufacturing military supplies in the near future. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference has encountered difficulties again as a result of French representative Peng Gu's speech today.</p>
<p>When discussing Article 22 concerning the destruction of tanks and land artillery, Peng Gu stated that the French government cannot comply with this unless the security and management and standardization of armaments requested by France have been fulfilled. German representative Nascheni then declared on the spot that Germany would have no choice but to withdraw its recognition of the disarmament plan. It is believed that British Foreign Secretary Simon will contact the French delegation in order to seek understanding. There was another unexpected event this afternoon. Turkish representative Rushdi Bei requested the abolition of the Straits clause in the Treaty of Versailles, saying that Turkey should have the right to rebuild the fortresses on the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and install heavy artillery. This issue may be studied by a committee composed of representatives of the Black Sea and Mediterranean countries and the United States and Japan. Peng Gu stated that the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference is not qualified to amend the treaty, but it was decided after public discussion to send the Turkish proposal to the various committees.

<p>(Berlin) German officials believe that US representative Davis's remarks in</p>
<p>Geneva yesterday were a step towards disarmament. German officials attach particular importance to the US representative's statement that countries with full armaments have an obligation to disarm so that they are equal to countries that have lifted their armaments. They said that this statement indicates that the United States has recognized the equal rights that Germany has requested, that is, to reduce armaments to the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles within the scope of general disarmament.

<p>Strenuously Consult with the French Government</p>
<p>(Geneva) Poland and the Little Entente (i.e., Yugoslavia,</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia, and Romania) are now very alarmed by the rumor that the Four-Power Pact between Britain, France, Italy, and Germany will be signed. Polish representatives stationed in Geneva and Paris have repeatedly held lengthy talks with French authorities on this matter. At the same time, Polish cabinet members also held a talk with the French ambassador in Warsaw yesterday. Representatives of the Little Entente are also making strenuous efforts in Paris on this matter. It is also heard that France is nervously consulting with Poland on one hand and contacting the Little Entente on the other. Once the Four-Power Pact is established, the policies of the Central European countries may change direction. According to a semi-official Warsaw statement, whether Poland is invited to join or not, Poland will definitely oppose any form of the Four-Power Pact. The general opinion in Warsaw is that the current form of the pact is a way to replace the principle of equality among nations with the principle of the superiority of a certain country. Poland is an autonomous group, and any treaty that Poland has not participated in the discussion and signed cannot bind Poland. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government has not yet received the new draft of the Four-Power Pact from Rome.</p>
<p>There are currently two issues that remain to be negotiated: one is the effective period of the pact. Germany advocates five years, while the other three countries advocate ten years. The other is the method of initiating treaty revisions. It seems that there is no final decision on the above two points. (Reuters Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the Petit Parisien, French Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Peng Gu met with Italian representative Arazzi in Geneva at 8:00 PM last night. It is heard that Arazzi informed Peng Gu that Italy and Germany have both agreed to the memorandum submitted by France regarding the draft of the Four-Power Treaty and the various revisions requested by the French Foreign Ministry. On the same evening, Peng Gu also held talks with the foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries for several hours. The content of the talks is unknown. (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(New York) As rumors spread that the exchange rate of the US dollar against foreign currencies will be stabilized within</p>
<p>a week, the Federal Reserve Banks in this and eleven other districts suddenly established an open market for purchasing government bonds. Several prominent bankers and financial experts in New York said that this move is an improper procedure that will endanger the life of the entire government bond market. In the future, the reserve banks will either destroy the market or never be able to resell these government bonds. However, according to Treasury Secretary Woodin, the maximum amount of bonds purchased at this time will not exceed 25 million yuan. Woodin did not comment on the impact of this move, but the New York Stock Exchange believes that it is the government's first step towards real inflation. However, bankers have slightly different observations, believing that its inflationary component is not as large as the expansion of credit (i.e., lending). According to the purchase of government bonds or government debt and the debt of companies in which the government is a major shareholder, it is authorized by Congress, that is, stipulated in the Rural Relief Act. Today, the initial price of the yuan was already weak, and the news of inflation made the prices of securities and goods soar, because merchants all believe that the rumor of stabilizing exchange rates is reliable, and they also believe that the value of the gold yuan after stabilization will be slightly lower than the price in the past week. However, regarding immediate stabilization, it has not been confirmed in Washington or London. Only the major countries are trying to stabilize currency prices before the opening of the Economic Conference. As for Wall Street and financial experts, they mostly oppose the re-inflation of the gold yuan today, believing that the only safe way at present is to stop inflating currency and focus on inflating credit.

<p>Tokyo, 24th—Prime Minister Saito, determined to establish a truly national cabinet, decided to invite the presidents of both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties to join the cabinet as ministers without portfolio. He first asked Finance Minister Takahashi to negotiate this matter with Suzuki, the president of the Seiyukai. However, Suzuki refused. The government side does not believe that Suzuki has completely refused, and plans to continue negotiating for Suzuki's entry into the cabinet. After this negotiation is completed, they will begin negotiations with Wakatsuki, the president of the Minseito.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Dentsu)—After Finance Minister Takahashi remained in office, with the intention of strengthening the extraordinary cabinet, he earnestly hoped for the entry of Seiyukai President Suzuki into the cabinet. However, Mr. Suzuki immediately refused, leading to the dissolution of concurrent efforts to urge the entry of Minseito President Wakatsuki. However, this ensured the permanence of Finance Minister Takahashi's remaining in office, and the future of the cabinet suddenly brightened. However, some people doubt the extent to which Takahashi's remaining in office will be effective. The Seiyukai will also observe quietly for the time being and will gradually take an opposing attitude during the budget preparation period. If this is the case, the situation will become like riding a tiger, moving towards the overthrow of the cabinet. However, the government side believes that the emergency has not yet been resolved, and with the justification of maintaining veteran ministers, it seems difficult to back down. Therefore, the result may lead to the dissolution of the Diet, which is worrying.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Dentsu)—President Konishi of Kyoto</p>
<p>Imperial University, to meet with Education Minister Hatoyama regarding the Professor Ryu Kawa incident, took a train from Hara Station yesterday and arrived in Tokyo at 7:00 AM this morning. It is reported that the president will refuse the Education Minister's dismissal of Professor Ryu Kawa. The president himself may also submit his resignation. Consequently, Kyoto University and the Ministry of Education are bound to have a head-on collision. Meanwhile, all professors in the Faculty of Law at Kyoto University have submitted their resignations to Director Miyamoto. All students in the Faculty of Law are also determined to withdraw completely. The situation is serious. Therefore, the meeting between the Education Minister and the president today is highly noteworthy. In addition, the Ministry of Education intends to consistently implement the Shangzhi policy. If President Konishi refuses to punish Professor Ryu Kawa, he will consult the Limitation Committee and impose a suspension penalty. Thus, the Professor Ryu Kawa punishment issue is bound to cause unprecedented turmoil.</p>

<p>Washington, 23rd (Reuters)—J. P. Morgan, president of the internationally renowned</p>
<p>Morgan Bank, was summoned to the Senate Securities Market Investigation Committee today. Accompanying him was his lawyer, John Davis, who once served as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The audience was large. Although the Senate committee room was spacious, it was still crowded, as this was unprecedented. The Morgan Company is a private enterprise, and as such, it is neither subject to the scrutiny of ordinary government banks nor required to publish a balance sheet to the public. The Senate committee has been sending personnel to investigate the company's books for months. According to Morgan, the company has a total of 250 million yuan in deposits and assets totaling 424 million yuan. Morgan stated that private banks are a benefit to the country, not a detriment. We have never been satisfied with merely abiding by the law of the land and have always sought to act in accordance with business regulations and to maintain the reputation passed down by our predecessors. The company's shareholders did not pay income tax in 1931 and 1932, and in 1930 they only paid 48,000 yuan in income tax. The company declared a loss of 21 million yuan as a result of its operations on January 12, 1931. The United States Internal Revenue Service has no objection to this report. Government experts are currently investigating the company's operations in 1932. Some members of the committee pointed out that private banks have too much power. Morgan replied that the power he has comes from the trust that the people have in his character and credit, but not because he simply possesses vast wealth. He has made mistakes, but they were errors of judgment rather than of principle. Although he does not approve of shareholders being dictators, he has had to do so because he is convinced that one of the duties of a private bank is to benefit the public in general and common affairs. The committee discovered that the bank had 167 employees who were managers. The committee decided to order the bank to hand over a list of shareholders, a list of customers with deposits of more than 100,000 yuan, a list of lending banks, and a list of favored customers.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Japanese Troops Pressing on Beiping and Tianjin, Peaceful Prospects Dim; <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Three Routes Surround Beiping, Intending to Cut Off Communication Between Beiping and Tianjin, Each Route Directly Approaches Beiping, Only 50-60 Li Away</p>
<p>Inching Forward, Forcing Me to Accept a Treaty Under Duress</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: Recently, the attitude of the Japanese troops has become increasingly tough. In recent days, they have been advancing on Beiping and Tianjin according to their second-step plan. They are now proceeding in three routes, planning to surround Beiping. One route is advancing along the Pinggu Avenue from Miyun in a frontal attack, threatening the northern side of Beiping. The front line is only 80-90 li away from Beiping. Another route is advancing from Huairou towards Changping, preparing to bypass the Pinghan Railway and cut off Beiping's rear. A third route is crossing the North Canal from Yanjiao Town, advancing towards Tongzhou, threatening the eastern side of Beiping. Another route is attacking from Sanhe Xianghe, directly towards Langfang, intending to cut off communication between Beiping and Tianjin. Yesterday, Japanese soldiers were found near Changping to the north and in the vicinity of Sanhe. Yesterday afternoon, five or six hundred Japanese soldiers, eleven armored vehicles, eighteen artillery pieces, and three tanks were also seen in Yanjiao, west of the town on the banks of the Grand Canal, building a bridge, intending to cross the river. Today, the Japanese troops continue to advance. The front line is only 50-60 li away from Beiping. The Japanese troops in Tianjin are also pressing forward from the Yutian, Shizhi, Ninghe, and Tangfang lines. Before Huang Fu's trip north, there was considerable consultation with the other side regarding the security of Beiping and Tianjin. After arriving in Beiping, he discussed the matter with He Yingqin and other military commanders in the north and ordered the troops at the front to move successively to the planned defense line. It was originally planned to move the troops at the front in the shortest possible time and in the fastest possible manner. However, because of defense concerns, Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun and others could not come to Beiping for consultations as scheduled. At the same time, the Japanese troops were also pressing closer, resulting in a situation where the planned plan could not be fully complied with. Internal opinions on the Japanese side are extremely inconsistent. The soldiers at the front are extremely arrogant. Taking advantage of the transfer of our troops, they are actively pressing forward, intending to directly approach Beiping and Tianjin, forcing us to accept a treaty under duress. If they fail to achieve their wishes, they will launch a disturbance in Beiping and Tianjin, using Chinese traitors as internal collaborators to expand the scope and stir up chaos in the north. When Huang Fu first went north, the atmosphere of peace was strong. The Chinese traitors lurking in Tianjin incited the Japanese, eagerly seeking to harass. Although the Japanese are dissatisfied with what these people are doing, in a situation where their desires have not yet been fulfilled, they can also take advantage of their troubles to help them achieve their threatening conspiracy. The riots by plainclothes teams in Tianjin a few days ago occurred for this reason. However, the Japanese have not yet reached the point where they can fully exploit these people, so after the riots by the plainclothes teams, they were unable to expand the scope. In short, the various conspiracies and facilities of the Japanese troops against Beiping and Tianjin are all aimed at exhausting their ability to threaten, in order to achieve their great desires. As for the focus of the dispute between the two sides, there are roughly three points: (1) Our side takes the principle of no compromise and no seeking peace. Peace can only be achieved under mutual understanding, and the scope is limited to local areas. The Japanese side wants to take the opportunity to fulfill its desires and must at least tacitly acknowledge the existence of Manchukuo. (2) Our side advocates for indirect negotiations between private individuals, while the Japanese side wants to hold public negotiations. (3) Our side means that both sides must first cease military action. Now that our troops have been transferred, the Japanese side should also retreat. The Japanese side wants our troops to leave Beiping and Tianjin first before discussing other matters. The most difficult point is that the Japanese side is not only internally inconsistent and lacks credibility, but also the soldiers at the front are arrogant and unruly, and there is no one who can be responsible for presiding over matters. Often the morning's discussion changes in the evening, this person holds this view, and that person acts that way. There is nothing certain. Therefore, the situation has been changing unpredictably in recent days. The two basic conditions reported in the newspapers have not yet been formally put forward. What the future holds depends on the development of the situation in the next few days before it can be determined. Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and others returned to Beiping last night and went to Jurentang to meet He Yingqin. They had a secret talk until 2:00 AM this morning before leaving. This morning at 8:00 AM, Song and others went to Fengzeyuan to meet Huang Fu and talked for about an hour, then went to Jurentang to meet He again. Song's arrival is very important, and the outside world is paying close attention. Shang Zhen's appointment as governor of Henan has been internally decided. After the announcement, he will lead his three divisions and Gao Guizi's and Shen Ke's two divisions into Henan. Most of the remaining troops will move towards the Pinghan Railway. Transportation is currently quite difficult. A large army is still stationed in the suburbs of Beiping to prevent the Japanese army from invading. If the Japanese military are bent on having their way, then they will fight to the last ditch, even if it means betting everything. Residents outside the city are flocking to the city to take refuge, but order in the city is still quite stable. (22nd)</p>

<p>Han traitor Hu Lifu, dissatisfied with the Jiangsu High Court's verdict of December 12th, 1932,</p>
<p>sentenced to life imprisonment, appealed to the Supreme Court. The original prosecuting attorney, Zhu Wenzhuo, also appealed at the same time, believing that Hu Lifu's punishment was too lenient. The Supreme Court has now rendered its judgment, overturning the original verdict and sentencing him to death. The reasons for the verdict are briefly recorded at the end. Now that the full text of the judgment has been delivered, it is specially copied and recorded below. It is reported that as soon as the Supreme Court approves the Ministry of Judicial Administration's instruction to the Supreme Court Procuratorate to notify the Jiangsu High Court Procuratorate, the death sentence will be carried out immediately. The execution date will be issued in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Facts <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>After January 28th, 1932, Hu Lifu</p>
<p>, when the Japanese army was severely disrupting Shanghai, and our 19th Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, Zhabei was occupied by the Japanese army. Hu Lifu then entrusted Engineer Washizaki, employed by Xiang Kaihecheng Nitric Acid Pharmaceutical Factory, to introduce him to the captain of the Japanese Fourth Battalion. Previously, the translators of the Japanese Fourth Battalion and others had formed the Jiangbei Headquarters to disrupt our army. After the Japanese army occupied Zhabei, they were eager to attack the Liuhuo and Taicang areas and were planning security in the rear, dissolving the headquarters. Coincidentally, Washizaki introduced Hu Lifu. Therefore, Translator Song and Captain Yamabana of the Japanese Army Headquarters ordered Hu Lifu to organize the Northern Citizens' Maintenance Association of the Northern City to replace the Jiangbei Headquarters. Hu Lifu was appointed as the chairman, and Yokota, a Japanese translator of the Fourth Battalion, was sent to the association. The association was divided into six groups: one was the General Affairs Group, with Washizaki and Yokota as directors; the second was the Finance Group, with Vice Chairman Wang Du concurrently serving as director; the third was the Patrol Group, with Chang Yuqing as director; the fourth was the Investigation Group, i.e., the Detective Section, with Yao Zhiduan as director; the fifth was the Transportation Group, with Cheng Hengchang as director; and the sixth was the Health Group, with Ding Qingyuan as director. There was also a Public Relations Group, which was presided over by Yan Dongyuan. There were about four or five hundred people in the association. The association was located in the Fourth District Police Station of Zabanzi Bridge. The affairs of the association were handled according to the instructions of the Japanese Fourth Battalion. The association fees still followed the methods of the Jiangbei Headquarters. All merchants and residents who transported goods out of Zhabei were required to have investigators from the association assess the price and collect a fee of 2%. After Hu Lifu signed and issued an exit permit, the Japanese army would check it and release them. It is estimated that from April 1st to April 10th of that year, more than 3,000 yuan was extorted. When the association existed, the Japanese army often went to inspect, and Yamabana personally praised Hu Lifu for maintaining it well. Later, after the League of Nations sent a telegram to the Japanese consul to inquire, the Japanese army claimed that it was a civilian organization and immediately ordered the association to be abolished. After the abolition, Hu Lifu reorganized the Jiuhe Company with Yokota and others, falsely claiming to be engaged in commerce. They opened gambling venues and opium dens in the company and sold opium. Among them, all affairs were still handled by Hu Lifu. It is estimated that within two weeks, more than 9,000 yuan was collected, half of which was taken away by Yokota, and the other half was used for company expenses. When the armistice was negotiated and the Japanese army withdrew from Zhabei, Hu Lifu, fearing punishment, hid in Washizaki's house. The Shanghai Municipal Government ordered his arrest many times without success. It was not until August 16th that Hu Lifu was lured to Xinya Restaurant on North Sichuan Road and arrested by detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and handed over to the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Reason <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>This case is divided into two parts for explanation as follows: (1) Regarding the organization</p>
<p>of the Maintenance Society, upon reviewing the files, the appellant Hu</p>
<p>Lifu stated in his confession at the Shanghai Public Security Bureau that, "I discussed it with Washizaki,</p>
<p>and he told me to come out. I thought this matter would definitely be opposed by the people and supervised by the government." He also said, "The Japanese Command knew that the Jiangbei Command was not doing a good job, so they wanted me to organize the Beishi (Northern Shanghai) Local Citizens' Maintenance Society." He also said, "I am the chairman, and there are six sections: Patrol Team, Investigation Team, Transportation Team, Finance Team, and General Affairs Team." "The General Affairs Team is headed by Washizaki Yokota." He also said, "Plainclothes patrol</p>
<p>officers maintain local order." He also said, "When merchants and residents move goods out of Zhabei, the society first sends investigators to estimate the value, and a tax of two yuan per hundred yuan of goods is collected, totaling more than three thousand yuan." He also said, "The transport permits at that time were issued by me." He also said, "From April 1st to the 10th, it lasted for ten days, and I handled everything." He also said, "At that time, foreigners sent telegrams to the International Federation, and the League of Nations sent telegrams to the Japanese consul to inquire about everything, and the American consul asked the Japanese consul whether it was organized by the Japanese, so the Japanese military headquarters ordered the cancellation of this Maintenance Society." During the investigation, he confessed that the Jiangbei Command was organized by the Japanese Fourth Battalion's interpreter's office. When we organized the Maintenance Society, the Jiangbei Command had already been disbanded." He also said, "The Japanese from the Fourth Battalion came to the Maintenance Society to inquire." He also said, "We cannot do things against the Fourth Battalion's consent." He also said, "There are several hundred members, and the content of the charter is to maintain public order..." (omission) "...added female inspectors." He also said, "At that time, the Japanese could not maintain it either, so they wanted me to come out and maintain it." He also said, "The Patrol Team is the police, and the Investigation Team is the detectives." He also said, "The Japanese army would let them pass if they saw the permit." He also said, "The Jiangbei Command had already done this before with the collection of cargo transport tax, and we are doing the same." He also said, "Washizaki went to smooth things over, and then sent Yokota. At that time, Yokota was already working as a translator in the Japanese Fourth Battalion. Yamazaki met me once and said that it was good that you came out to maintain it, and now the Jiangbei Command's reputation is too bad, so they want you to come out to maintain the place." In the original trial, he confessed that he told Washizaki, and Washizaki promised to tell the Japanese military commander that things would be successful by March 4th." He also said, "Yamazaki is the captain, and Takanatsu is the commander-in-chief." He also said, "The Japanese often came to check," etc. It is clear that the appellant has already explained how he entrusted Washizaki to smooth things over, organized the Beishi Local Citizens' Maintenance Society to replace the Jiangbei Command, how he was entrusted by the Japanese army, and was examined by them, how he divided into groups to handle affairs, and added female inspectors as well as police detectives, how he followed the Jiangbei Command's method of levying cargo transport taxes, how he helped to maintain the rear when the Japanese army could not maintain public order, and how he handled affairs according to the Japanese Fourth Battalion's wishes. All of these have been confessed frankly without hesitation. Referencing the investigation report obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Government, it is consistent. Although the appellant argued that the purpose of organizing the society was to handle charitable matters and had no political implications, and that he had reported it to the Municipal Government and was not entrusted by the Japanese army, etc., since the society had a chairman and vice-chairman, and was organized into six sections, and recruited police and hired detectives, how could it be said to have no political implications? Copying the Jiangbei Command's method of levying donations to harm the people, and setting up male and female inspectors to check entries and exits, how could it be entrusted as a charitable undertaking? Moreover, the so-called report, not only did the original trial send a letter to the Municipal Government to inquire, but it was replied that there was no such thing, and the original trial also reviewed the Municipal Government's files and found no documents of the appellant's report. It is extremely obvious that it is a cover-up. As for the layer of entrustment, the appellant only insisted on not admitting it because no entrustment documents were found. It should be known that the appellant's repeated confessions, such as "they wanted me to organize" and "I came out to maintain," etc., have already revealed the meaning of entrustment. Furthermore, the fact that the Japanese army would let them pass if they held the permit issued by the appellant, the society was questioned by the League of Nations, the Japanese military headquarters immediately ordered the cancellation, and the society's actions could not violate the Japanese Fourth Battalion's consent, and the Japanese often came to the society to inquire, etc., are sufficient to show that the power of existence, abolition, supervision was completely controlled by the Japanese army, and it is difficult to conceal that it was entrusted by the Japanese army. In addition, what the appellant has repeatedly argued is that he did not serve in the enemy army and did not harm the Republic of China. According to the meaning of serving, it refers to performing all affairs for the enemy army, regardless of whether it is participating in the enemy army's strategy or engaging in other miscellaneous affairs, etc. The appellant, when Zhabei was occupied by the Japanese army, was entrusted by the Japanese army and openly organized an illegal organization within its occupied area, and called on as many as four or five hundred followers to engage in detective inspections and levy taxes on the transport of goods, to maintain the rear order for the enemy, so that its troops invading Liuhe and Taicang could be fearless and devote all their efforts to advance to the front line, which increased the danger of the National Army resisting the enemy. If this is not called serving, what is called serving? If this is not called harming the Republic of China, what is called harming? Based on this, the original judgment determined that the appellant constituted the crime of Article 109, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China. According to Article 74 of the Criminal Law, the sentence was determined according to Article 109, Paragraph 1, which is not illegal. The appellant's appeal is not reasonable. However, the appellant has witnessed the fierce resistance of the National Army and the tragic attack on Beishi, but when the enemy army could not maintain the rear order, he entrusted someone to introduce him to the enemy and willingly served for them. Judging from the above situation, it is really unforgivable. The prosecutor's appeal stated that the defendant, i.e., the appellant, served as the chairman of the society, and the circumstances of the crime cannot be said to be insignificant. The original judgment only sentenced him to life imprisonment, and the sentencing was somewhat inappropriate, etc., which is hard to say without reason. (2) Regarding the organization of the company, after reviewing the files, the appellant Hu Lifu confessed at the Shanghai Public Security Bureau that after we retreated to Linping Road on April 11th, the economy was extremely panicked. At that time, I wanted to organize the Jiuhe Company..." (omission) "...The Japanese Yokota came up with the idea of opening gambling, selling cigarettes, and selling soil," etc. He also said, "I am responsible for it." He also said, "After two weeks, a total of more than nine thousand yuan was collected. Yokota took half, and the remaining half was used for the expenses of the Jiuhe Company," etc. It is clear that the appellant already admitted in detail that after the Citizens' Maintenance Society was disbanded, he intended to organize the Jiuhe Company, intending to make profits, and that gambling, selling cigarettes, and selling soil were handled by him within the company. The verification is still consistent with the investigation report obtained by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Although the appellant argued that the confessions made in the Public Security Bureau were due to torture, etc., it is only empty words and no evidence was presented, intending to overturn it, which is not credible. The original judgment therefore determined that the appellant violated Article 280 of the Criminal Law, sentenced him to two years of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand yuan, the crime of Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, sentenced him to two years of imprisonment and a fine of one thousand yuan, and the crime of Article 10 of the Anti-Smoking Law, sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. The rule of evidence is not inappropriate. The appellant's appeal is still hard to say reasonable. Based on the above arguments, according to Article 409, Paragraph 1, Article 410, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 41 of the Criminal Law, Article 109, Paragraph 1, Article 6 and Article 10 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, Article 74, Article 120, Article 57, Paragraph 3, Article 70, Item 1 of the Criminal Law, and Article 408, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Control Yuan impeaches Chen Weizhou, the salt transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News, Control Yuan member Jie Fu said that Wang Jiading, the former director of the Hunan Salt Transport Bureau,</p>
<p>and Chen Weizhou, the current salt transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, violated the salt law, harmed the country and the people, and specially filed an impeachment with the Control Yuan. After being submitted for review and established, it was transferred to the Central Public Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action. Now, the full text of the impeachment and review report is recorded in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Original text of impeachment <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>For the matter of Guangdong salt being transported and sold to Hunan through bribery and illegal means,</p>
<p>specifically raise an impeachment case. Citizens' representatives Tang Jian and Xiao Du in Hunan</p>
<p>and various public organizations in Lian County, Guangdong, accused Chen Weizhou, the Guangdong salt transport commissioner,</p>
<p>of specially allowing Taili Heki Company to transport Guangdong salt to Hunan and to handle the sale of local salt in six counties in northern Guangdong. At the same time, the issuance of transport licenses to free salt merchants was stopped, and Wang Jiading, the former director of the Hunan Salt Transport Bureau, and Taili Heki Company signed a covenant, allowing only one company to transport and sell, and falsely claiming that they had accommodated all merchants and had the Ministry of Finance approve a trial run, accepted bribes, violated the law, and harmed the people, and vowed to oppose it, etc. It is found that the salt affairs in various places in our country, such as Lianghuai, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Shanxi, etc., since the implementation of commercial sales, have resulted in monopolies, causing numerous malpractices, raising prices, and mixing in mud and sand. On the one hand, it deprives the people of the freedom to purchase, causing them to eat expensive and inferior salt. On the other hand, it causes smuggled salt to flood the market, and the state's tax revenue is also reduced, resulting in the failure of salt administration, which is irreversible. Nothing is more serious than this, which harms the country from above and harms the people from below. From the former Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, people of insight in the government and the public have advocated reform, but they have been dismissed by wealthy merchants who bribed officials. The Legislative Yuan, ignoring everything, resolved the new salt law, which clearly states in the first article of the first chapter that salt should be taxed on site and that people should be free to buy and sell, and no one should be allowed to monopolize it. It has been promulgated by the National Government and resolved by the National Assembly to implement it within a time limit. According to the latest report from the Salt Affairs Audit General Office, it is said that the new salt law of free buying and selling is difficult to achieve overnight nationwide, but efforts should be made to build warehouses and strictly organize field police to prepare for implementation. Now that it has been opened, it has reached more than half of the total, etc. Breaking the monopoly system is the fundamental spirit of the new salt law, and gradually restoring the people's freedom to buy and sell is the only policy for promoting salt administration. If it was originally free trade, but now it is packaged and sold by merchants, it is a reversal and the greatest crime of undermining the salt law. It is found that Guangdong salt has been sold to Hunan, and historically, no matter where the merchants are from, once they pay taxes and obtain a license from the Guangdong Transport Commissioner's Office, they can distribute salt for purchase and sale and sell it freely. The price is lower than Huai salt, and the porters and laborers in dozens of counties in Hunan carry local goods to exchange for Guangdong salt and return, making the trade between Hunan and Guangdong increasingly developed, with an annual amount of tens of millions. Not only is the social economy invigorated, but the state's tax revenue is also increased. It has been implemented for decades, and both the upper and lower levels are convenient. As early as 1929, Taili Heki Company, a Guangdong merchant, came to Hunan to promote package sales. According to Hu Xingchi, the director of the Transport Bureau at that time, the company bribed 200,000 yuan and asked for package transport, but because it would harm the people of Hunan too much, he refused to do it. Li Fengyao, who succeeded him, also did the same. Bin Bucheng, the former president of Hunan University, also exposed the matter in the Changsha Pili newspaper. What he said was true, and no one denied it. When Wang Jiading became the director, he was blinded by greed and signed the so-called 19 Articles of Covenant for Package Transport with the company. He did not submit it to the Ministry of Finance for instructions and approval, but instead, with the strength of the local officials, he submitted it to the provincial government for deliberation and approval. He Jian, the chairman of the provincial government, consulted the Ministry of Finance for approval to open it. On February 3, 1931, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Hunan Provincial Government, saying that the package merchant system has more disadvantages than advantages and has long been criticized by the world. The salt affairs in various places that were originally handled by package merchants are being reformed. It is not appropriate for places that are not package merchants to implement package merchants again, which would cause malpractices and leave a bad name, etc. It can be seen that the Ministry of Finance is determined to reform the salt administration and is unwilling to accommodate local officials in order to violate the law and harm the people. Later, the Hunan provincial authorities repeatedly used the pretext of urgent military expenses to coerce and repeatedly telegraphed for approval, but the Ministry of Finance still attached the condition of accommodating all transport merchants so that they would not lose their jobs, and it can be seen that they could not bear to ignore public opinion. However, the Hunan salt affairs authorities colluded with Chen Weizhou, the salt transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, and falsely reported that the company had accommodated 80% of the salt merchants, and then lied to the Ministry of Finance, and it was approved on July 7, 1932, to temporarily conduct a trial run. Chen Weizhou, the transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, approved the company to start early on November 1 and to bring local salt from six counties in northern Guangdong to Hunan for sale. At the same time, the transport licenses of the respective salt merchants were all stopped. Thus, this illegal and harmful package merchant system was finally realized, and all the citizens on the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi rose up in opposition, and letters and telegrams were exchanged, but to no avail. After the Guangdong salt was monopolized by the company for sale, the salt stores with eight openings would be seen to close down at the same time, and all the merchants would lose their jobs, and millions of coolies and porters would have no way to make a living and would take risks. The price of Hunan salt is now raised by 2 yuan, 8 dimes, and 2 cents of small silver. In the future, the monopoly position will become increasingly stable, and it can be asserted that they will increase and mix it arbitrarily, even more than Huai salt. Then the entire population of more than 30 counties in southern Hunan will eat inferior and expensive salt, and its impact on livelihoods is not shallow. Unexpectedly, at a time when the upper and lower levels are advocating reform of the salt administration, such a bad policy has appeared. Isn't it strange? Salt tax is a central tax revenue. Recently, the surcharges in various provinces have also been unified under the central government. Then the reform of the salt system should be completely dominated by the Ministry of Finance. How can it be submitted to the provincial government for deliberation and approval? It can be seen that they are deliberately undermining the central salt administration. It can be seen that the responsible personnel of Hunan and Guangdong salt affairs, such as Wang Jiading, the former director of the Hunan Salt Transport Bureau, and Chen Weizhou, the current salt transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, accepted bribes, violated the law, and harmed the people. The evidence is conclusive, and they are guilty and cannot be pardoned. An impeachment should be filed according to law, and the National Government should be requested to take urgent relief measures, and the Ministry of Finance should be strictly ordered to revoke the order to allow Taili Heki Company to conduct a trial run of package transport and sale of Guangdong salt to Hunan, in order to maintain the rule of law and benefit the people's livelihood. Whether it is appropriate, please submit it to the president for review and implementation. Control Yuan member Luo Jiefu, April 15.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Review report <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>For the matter of reporting, the case was assigned to Luo Jiefu</p>
<p>Member Luo Jiefu impeached Wang Jiading, the former director of the Hunan Salt Transport Bureau,</p>
<p>and Chen Weizhou, the current salt transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, etc. for violating the salt law, harming the country and the people.</p>
<p>After joint review, it was agreed that the freedom to sell salt is stipulated by the new salt law. In places that were originally packaged by merchants, efforts should be made to reform. In places that have always been free, package merchants should not be allowed again. However, Wang Jiading, the director of the Hunan Salt Transport Bureau, and Chen Weizhou, the salt transport commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, were greedy for bribes and disregarded the people's livelihood. In six counties in Hunan, which have always been free to sell salt, Taili Heki Company was allowed to be the only one to sell Guangdong salt. It is undeniable that they violated the law and harmed the people. The director and transport commissioner should be handed over for disciplinary action according to law, and the Executive Yuan should be consulted to order the relevant agencies to cancel the package merchant method of Taili Heki Company in order to maintain the salt law and value the people's livelihood. This report is hereby submitted, and it is hoped that the president will review and implement it. Salt Affairs Committee members Zhou Lisheng, Zhang Hualan, and Yu Hongqi, April 24 (Riri News Agency).</p>
<h3 id="e110">Labor unrest occurs in Wuhan yarn factory <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Many yarn factories have successively reduced working hours. Zhenhuan Yarn Factory announced its closure, and thousands of workers petitioned for resumption of work.</p>
<p>Hankou correspondence, recently, the number of unemployed people in Wuhan is over 100,000.</p>
<p>Those who are fortunate enough to find a job, such as dockers and rickshaw pullers, etc., are hired at reduced prices. They work hard all day but can hardly get enough to eat. Only factory workers have a fixed income and barely maintain their lives. Among the factories, yarn factories occupy an important position. The larger ones are Taian Yarn Factory, run by the Japanese, and Xin Xin Yarn Factory, Yuhua Yarn Factory, Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, First Yarn Factory, and Minsheng Yarn Factory, run by the Chinese. On March 28 this year, Taian Yarn Factory announced its closure, and the remaining workers suddenly became unemployed. On the 29th, Xin Xin Yarn Factory unexpectedly caught fire again, and a total of 4,000 workers lost their jobs. Half a million laborers had nowhere to go, and a wave of reduced working hours broke out in various factories. Minsheng Yarn Factory in Wuchang took the lead in implementing it, resulting in the tragic incident of soldiers and police shooting workers on April 30. Subsequently, Zhenhuan Yarn Factory and First Yarn Factory continued to reduce working hours. Under the mediation of the authorities, the workers reluctantly complied. The Minsheng incident was also resolved peacefully. The garrison headquarters believed that the situation was serious and that communist elements might take the opportunity to infiltrate and instigate unrest. It advised various factories to take the overall situation into consideration and maintain the status quo for at least May to ensure security. However, various factories claimed that their business was not prosperous. Only Yuhua Factory did not reduce working hours. After the wave of reduced working hours came to an end, Zhenhuan Yarn Factory suddenly announced its closure on the 22nd, and labor-capital disputes could not avoid expanding. The factory's capital has always been known to be abundant, and it is independently operated by Liu Huchen, the richest man in Wuchang. For more than ten years, its business has been quite good. After implementing reduced working hours and reduced wages this time, it still felt that the turnover was not working. On the 21st, Xu Shunwu, the manager of the factory, announced that the factory would be closed the next day to clear the accounts. On the one hand, he reported to the military and political authorities for protection, and on the other hand, he negotiated with the person in charge of the labor union. The labor union stated that the factory should maintain operations until the workers agreed, in order to comply with the spirit of labor-capital coordination. If the request was not accepted and operations were suspended abruptly, the factory should be responsible for any incidents that occurred. On the 22nd, the factory actually closed down and requested a large number of armed soldiers and police to suppress it. The workers suddenly lost their source of income and elected representatives Jia Kun, Deng Zhanyuan, Chen Laoda, etc., more than 50 people, to petition the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, and the garrison headquarters, requesting that they be ordered to resume work. The Wuchang Textile Labor Union also urgently reported to the party, government, and military authorities, requesting that they take measures to provide relief, stating that "Although it is a fact that Zhenhuan Company's goods are sluggish, the workers still worked hard after the implementation of reduced working hours in order to maintain their lives. Unexpectedly, the company disregarded the overall situation and wanted to use the pretext of losses to close down, which is too much oppression. Among the yarn factories in Wuchang with abundant capital, Yuhua is the most, Zhenhuan is the second, and First Yarn and Minsheng are the next. Yuhua has not reduced working hours so far. Zhenhuan, First Yarn, and Minsheng have all implemented reduced working hours. First Yarn and Minsheng can continue to operate, and Xia Huan should not be unable to support it. It is really no different from putting thousands of our workers to death. In the face of the urgent foreign insults, the red disaster has not been cleared, and it is another eventful May. If thousands of workers are unemployed once, I am afraid that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to incite and endanger the local area." The factory has about 3,000 workers. Together with Taian and Xin Xin factories, the number of unemployed workers reaches 7,000 to 8,000. (According to Taian and Xin Xin,</p>
<p>Although the unemployed workers have been given relief, the number is very small.) It is a serious social problem in Wuhan. If First Yarn Factory and Minsheng Yarn Factory follow suit and close down again, the labor unrest will be even easier to expand. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cultural Relics Unearthed in Ling County <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Buddhist relics are extremely valuable ancient artifacts have been transported to Jinan Library</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence, Song Dynasty buildings were discovered in Ling County, northern Shandong, last month,</p>
<p>and many ancient artifacts were obtained. The provincial government ordered the county to transport the ancient artifacts to Jinan for preservation. The ancient artifacts were transported to Jinan the day before yesterday. The provincial library was ordered by the provincial government to transport the ancient artifacts to the library for preservation today. A reporter visited and saw six ancient bronze mirrors, sixteen copper coins, one silver coin, one silver monk hat, two stone tablets, one stone coffin, and</p>
<p>a package of silver pieces (with patterns), and a small box of stones the size of beans, which are Buddhist relics, all obtained from the coffin. According to Wang Xiantang, the librarian, the ancient mirrors and ancient coins are not very important, but the stone coffin has research value. Because the discovery of stone coffins is not new, and there are also stone coffins from the Han Dynasty, but there are not many with text and paintings. This coffin has both words and paintings, which can be used to study the styles of stone coffins in the Song Dynasty, so it is quite valuable. The reporter witnessed that the coffin was about two feet long, one foot wide, and one foot deep, with one end large and one end small. Five monks were carved on each of the two sides, and two people were carved on the large end. It is not known what the intention was. Each wore a pointed hat, and the patterns were all raised, about one inch high. The words "Great Song Huangyou" were carved on the coffin lid. The style of the writing was ancient. The ancient bronze coins had the years of Xiangfu and Qingli. The silver coin was very thin and had the words "The world is peaceful and the people are safe" on it. The picture gallery has been properly preserved now.</p>
<p>The small stones in the stone coffin, like beads, are the only Buddhist relics. They originally appeared in the incense burner of Qianming Temple in Qihe Town, Changqing County, various states (the place where the ancient artifacts were discovered in Ling County). The local people liked to make offerings and raised funds to build a silver box to hold them. The box has been crushed (referring to the crushed silver pieces in the coffin). The small Buddha statues in the coffin are the decorations on the box, and there is also a hat top, which is the top of the lid. The box was placed in a stone coffin. The coffin and the stone tablet are carved with the scene of the relics coming out of the furnace. At that time, a kiosk was built for offering sacrifices. Later, it was submerged in the soil and only unearthed today after more than 800 years. It is a unique discovery in archeology and is of great value. Unfortunately, the inscription on the tablet is blurred. (23rd)</p>

<p>To the Editor: Recently, I read in your newspaper's May 12 and 27 issues about the resolutions of the support conference after the Xin Renhe Wheel disaster to present the party and government agencies to arrest the murderer and bring him to justice. My name is mentioned in it, which is very surprising. Since I was appointed as the Administrative Supervisor and Commissioner of the Second District of Hubei by General Commander Chiang last September, I have been busy with military affairs and government affairs. Since taking office, I have not left my post and have no spare time to engage in shipping in Shanghai. Whether there is another person with the same name as me is something I could have ignored. However, since the conference claims to be organized by the fellow villagers' associations of Daye and other counties, I should have heard of it since I am stationed in Daye. There must be a misunderstanding, or there is another purpose. I cannot but state the facts and write to your newspaper for correction. I hereby inform you and wish you good health. Sincerely, Tang Ken, Administrative Supervisor and Commissioner of the Second District of Hubei, Shanghai Shen Bao. May 22.</p>

<p>Provincial order to secretly arrest the principal of a primary school</p>
<p>The Fourth District Commissioner's Office recently received a provincial order to secretly arrest</p>
<p>Zhu Guocang, the principal of Zhang Liantang Primary School in Qingpu, and send him to the province for verification. Commissioner Jin then instructed Shen Bangda, the captain of the water patrol team, to take armed police officers to the school the night before last. The principal was teaching at the time. Shen remained silent until the class was over, and then ordered the team to arrest him and take him back to Songjiang. He then instructed Fei Gongxia, the patrol officer of the team, to take the document and escort Zhu Guocang to Zhenjiang for interrogation. Zhu is suspected of being a communist, is about twenty years old, wears a suit, and is very calm.</p>

<p>Arson Attempt Due to Failed Extortion</p>
<p>In Zhang Huaili area of the Third District (Yangming Township) of the county,</p>
<p>a villager named Zhang Dalin had saved some money and was building several new houses. Before the completion of the construction, he was targeted by bandits. Two weeks ago,</p>
<p>he suddenly received a threatening letter from bandits identifying themselves as the Righteous and Brave Corps. The letter vaguely stated that the corps was experiencing financial difficulties and needed to "borrow" one hundred silver dollars, which should be delivered to the paper basket at the back gate of the private Tang Family Elementary School near Tang Lane by a certain date. Dalin disregarded the letter. A few days later, he received a second letter. Dalin still ignored it. Then, he received a third letter, with more serious language, stating that if he did not comply, they would set fire to the new houses. Dalin managed to gather thirty silver dollars and went to the agreed location the day before yesterday evening. Because there were many passersby, he stood by the roadside to observe. He saw a middle-aged man wearing black clothes and pants, carrying a black robe, reaching into the paper basket. The bandit, failing to find the money, walked eastward towards North Bridge in disappointment. Dalin returned home immediately. The back door suddenly caught fire late yesterday evening. Fortunately, a carpenter noticed it and extinguished the fire, preventing a major disaster. He has reported the situation to the First Branch Office of the Eighth Public Security Bureau for the arrest of the bandits.</p>

<p>Recently, robbery cases have been occurring frequently in the four rural areas of this county. The Head of the Detective Team of the County Public Security Bureau,</p>
<p>Xue Furui, received a tip-off the day before yesterday that several major robbery suspects from the Yingshu Garden area near Yinzhaqiao in the western countryside were hiding in Suzhou. He immediately went to investigate and arrest them. After receiving the report, Head Xue immediately led Detective Dai Shouquan and all the detectives to Suzhou overnight. They arrested four notorious robbers, including Yu A'da, at the Horen Inn, and seized a six-inch Browning pistol and several Tang hall bullets. They were immediately escorted back to Wuxi. Under strict interrogation by the Detective Team, the robbers confessed to countless crimes committed in Wuxi. They were involved in the robbery of Li Hebao's home near Doutou Bridge in the northern countryside. It is said that this gang of robbers, combined with gangs from Changzhou, Jiangyin, and Suzhou, numbers in the dozens.

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government received an order from the Executive Yuan to issue</p>
<p>two million yuan of silk industry public bonds, which were sealed and not issued in the 20th year of the Republic, to provide relief to the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The Ministry of Finance would pay the interest, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces would be responsible for repaying the principal. The provincial government was ordered to quickly plan and implement the order. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government believed that with the silk industry declining daily and suffering a setback, issuing two million yuan of public bonds, no matter what, would be insufficient to cover expenses given the current situation. They requested that the previous plan of the Ministry of Industry to issue five million yuan be followed to provide relief. Furthermore, the province's rural villages are facing economic bankruptcy and financial exhaustion, and they are unable to bear the burden of repaying the principal of the public bonds. They requested that the Ministry of Finance be responsible for raising the necessary funds.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>This time, due to the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico, distressed overseas Chinese were forced</p>
<p>to return home. On the way through Shanghai, we were first rescued by the Global Overseas</p>
<p>Chinese Federation, taking the lead even before the government. We were also greatly publicized</p>
<p>by the Shanghai media, initiating the effort even before the government. Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Tiecheng planned and coordinated the effort, even before the central government. Now, we are grateful for General Chiang Kai-shek's generous donation of ten thousand yuan, leading the way for party and state leaders to contribute. All of these demonstrate a positive impression. On behalf of all the distressed overseas Chinese, I would like to express our most sincere gratitude. Zhulin and others were entrusted by the overseas Chinese forced to return home from Mexico to stay in Shanghai with two important missions: First, to urge the government to negotiate strongly with Mexico to stop the anti-Chinese persecution, in order to protect the lives and property of the overseas Chinese currently in Mexico (referring to those who have not returned home) from being affected by the anti-Chinese persecution and being expelled again. Second, to find ways to provide relief to the four thousand overseas Chinese forced to return home in the motherland, in order to solve their livelihood problems and alleviate their suffering. However, negotiation and relief are major undertakings, and cannot achieve great results without the cooperation and promotion of all parties. Moreover, the representatives have lived abroad for a long time and are new to returning south. We are unfamiliar with the situation in the motherland and difficult to develop without the guidance and support of all sectors. Therefore, we have prepared this banquet today to invite guidance from all sectors and present the truth about the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico. This is the reason and significance of our gathering. I am grateful that you have not abandoned us and are willing to come, which shows your concern for the distressed overseas Chinese. We are deeply grateful and bow our heads in thanks. However, what are the methods and objectives of our request for negotiation and appeal for relief? I will now elaborate on this to all of you.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Relief Measures <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the methods, (1) first establish a Distressed</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Relief Association in Shanghai to concentrate the spirit and strength of all</p>
<p>the distressed overseas Chinese as a guiding organization for protecting</p>
<p>the interests of the distressed overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(2) Begin to carry out a general registration of the distressed overseas Chinese, analyzing their technical skills, in order to find ways to resettle them and relieve their suffering. (3) Raise a large sum of money to establish a Chinese Overseas Factory in Shanghai, specifically to accommodate the general distressed overseas Chinese forced to return home from Mexico and who are unemployed, in order to stabilize their lives and prevent them from becoming beggars. (4) All matters related to relief, whether fundraising or distribution, will be handled entirely by the aforementioned Distressed Overseas Chinese Relief Association, in order to achieve effective relief and avoid disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Request to the Government <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the objectives, we have five requests to the government: (1)</p>
<p>Donate a considerable amount of money (or 200,000) as the foundation for the Chinese Overseas Factory.</p>
<p>(2) Donate</p>
<p>fifty acres of wasteland near Shanghai as the land for building the aforementioned factory. (3) Allocate other public land for the distressed overseas Chinese to plant or engage in other agriculture. (4) Within the shortest possible time, order the Navy to send several warships to Mexico to demonstrate strength and provide effective protection. (5) Give our distressed overseas Chinese the opportunity and convenience to help ourselves, and do not obstruct our self-help efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Hope from All Sectors <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>We also have five hopes from all sectors: (1) Appreciate the significant sacrifices made by overseas Chinese</p>
<p>for the country and society, and the suffering they have endured from being oppressed by foreign races, and provide material assistance.</p>
<p>(2) Correct the political discrimination against overseas Chinese and the neglect of the distressed overseas Chinese. (3) Support the implementation of the Chinese Overseas Factory with spirit and material resources. Furthermore, yesterday I read in the newspaper that Comrade Chen Shuren, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, reported on overseas Chinese affairs at the Central Memorial Week on the 22nd of this month. In his report, he said, "Recently, we have changed our former discriminatory attitude towards overseas Chinese to one of respect." Based on his statement, Chairman Chen has clearly admitted that in the past, there was discrimination against overseas Chinese. This time, the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico has become increasingly fierce, causing losses of over 40 million yuan to the overseas Chinese in Mexico, which is due to the government's daily neglect of the interests of overseas Chinese and its failure to protect them. The government should bear full responsibility for this. Based on the latter statement, the government has changed to an attitude of respect, and we hope that the government will fulfill its promise to respect overseas Chinese and immediately provide all the distressed overseas Chinese in Mexico with satisfactory guarantees and protection. Then, why would we ask for another grain of rice for relief?</p>
<h3 id="e132">Report on the Events <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico has lasted for over two years, and many people know the general situation,</p>
<p>but not the truth. This is because the events can only be described by those who have personally experienced them.</p>
<p>The representatives are all distressed overseas Chinese forced to return</p>
<p>home, having suffered personally and been deeply stimulated. We have experienced</p>
<p>difficulties and dangers.</p>
<p>Now, in order to allow the people of our country to fully understand the situation, we will provide a general report on the facts, shedding tears as we present it to our beloved compatriots and all sectors of Shanghai. We hope that benevolent people will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Motives for the Anti-Chinese Persecution <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Foreigners residing in Mexico include Americans, Japanese,</p>
<p>Chinese, Germans, British, Russians, Italians,</p>
<p>Spaniards, and others, totaling no less than 300,000</p>
<p>people. Why is Mexico persecuting the Chinese, and why</p>
<p>is it persecuting the Chinese alone? This has value for research. To find the reasons for this, one aspect is the shadow of the world economy, another is the political disputes in Mexico, and another is the lack of protection from our government. The above points are the general causes of this severe anti-Chinese persecution. At that time, unemployed workers in Mexico and politicians who harbored hatred towards overseas Chinese colluded with each other, took the opportunity to vigorously promote the persecution, and supported each other. From propaganda to action, from action to organization, in June 1931, they openly established the Anti-Chinese Party in Mexico City to carry out a substantive anti-Chinese movement. This is the origin and motive of the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Ineffective Negotiations <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico began, it has lasted for two years.</p>
<p>Although our government has repeatedly negotiated, it has</p>
<p>not taken practical and effective measures to maintain order. May I ask</p>
<p>the government, has it ever sent a warship to protect our</p>
<p>overseas Chinese? No, it has not. Has it ever sent a commissioner to negotiate and comfort our overseas Chinese? Again, no, it has not. The government has not even taken these simplest measures to protect overseas Chinese. As a result, our overseas Chinese in Mexico are being humiliated and have no protection. Not only are they being expelled, but their property is being looted, and they are even being driven back to their country without food or clothing, like beggars. The various tragic situations are too numerous to recount. Our spiritual and material losses in this anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico cannot be said to be due to the government's neglect of the interests of overseas Chinese and its failure to protect them.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Means of Oppression <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese residing in Mexico, the number</p>
<p>engaged in commerce and agriculture is the largest.</p>
<p>In terms of business, agriculture,</p>
<p>besides Britain and Germany, we rank third.</p>
<p>However, overseas Chinese have never had strong capital. The reason why</p>
<p>they were able to achieve this position is due to their diligence and hard work. If they had received adequate protection from the government, why would the spiritual value that our overseas Chinese earned with their blood and sweat be seized and destroyed by a small country like Mexico (with a total population of only 14 million and a total land, sea, and air force of only 50,000)? Therefore, although there is more than one reason for the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico this time, it should be known that the main reason is the lack of protection capabilities of our government. The Mexican government and people, from contempt to abuse, from abuse to violence, from violence to expulsion, have progressed step by step, becoming increasingly fierce. From passive to active, from propaganda to implementation, in the beginning, the Mexican government first promulgated the most severe commercial laws to oppress overseas Chinese. Every Chinese store was limited to ten employees, and eight Mexican natives had to be hired. Not only that, the onerous business tax levied on overseas Chinese increased sharply from ten yuan to one hundred yuan. Our government had no way to negotiate, and overseas Chinese had no choice but to sacrifice everything and voluntarily close their businesses. This is in terms of commerce. Then, the Anti-Chinese Party went out to rob and confiscate registration papers (residence permits), arbitrarily detained people, and subjected them to all kinds of humiliation. All of these are the oppressive means of the anti-Chinese persecution in Mexico. Their cruelty and illegality are unprecedented in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Suffering <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Anti-Chinese Party in Mexico's treatment of overseas Chinese</p>
<p>is truly cruel and unprecedented in the world. They treat our Chinese people like</p>
<p>cattle and horses. Their harsh methods</p>
<p>are worse than the treatment of prisoners of war in warring countries. They seize</p>
<p>property, violently beat people, and after beating them, transport them by car and abandon them in the mountains. They have nothing to eat for three days, and many die from starvation and cold. Although we were fortunate enough to escape, surviving by the skin of our teeth, there are still over 20,000 people who have not escaped the danger. How can we sit idly by? The tragedy of this situation makes those who hear it sad and those who see it shed tears. It is truly unfortunate to be born as a citizen of the Republic of China and even more unfortunate to reside in the evil Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Estimated Losses <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Among the overseas Chinese residing in Mexico, most are engaged in business</p>
<p>and agriculture, and about 30,000</p>
<p>people are directly or indirectly affected by the anti-Chinese persecution.</p>
<p>Among these 30,000 people, each person has at least 2,000 yuan in assets, totaling 60 million yuan (Mexican silver).</p>
<p>The material losses caused by this anti-Chinese persecution should be in the range of 70%. Although there are no accurate statistics, based on mathematical calculations, it should be over 40 million yuan. The spiritual losses have not yet been calculated.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Difficulties of Returning Home <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Our overseas Chinese in Mexico have suffered all kinds of harsh treatment from the Mexican government</p>
<p>and unreasonable oppression from the Anti-Chinese Party.</p>
<p>It is impossible to do business, and it is also impossible to engage in agriculture. It is even more impossible for laborers to gain a foothold. If they are not</p>
<p>expelled, they will be trapped in a desperate situation, awaiting death. They have no choice but to consider returning south. However, the issue of returning home is also difficult to resolve. After all, travel expenses require money. Without sufficient preparation, how can they make the journey? After being robbed by the Anti-Chinese Party, under environmental oppression, it is extremely difficult to obtain several hundred yuan for return expenses. However, if they do not find a way to resolve the issue urgently, they will either die tragically or become beggars. This is why our overseas Chinese in Mexico risk great danger to sneak into the United States in search of a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, they are detained by the US government and eventually repatriated home, which is still fortunate. However, after returning to their homeland, they are penniless and have no home to return to. The difficulties of this situation are hard to describe in writing. They are now wandering on the road, in dire need of assistance. We beg the benevolent people of our motherland to sympathize with their plight, generously donate, and do their best to help. The distressed overseas Chinese will be extremely grateful, and the nation will be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Five Batches of Distressed Overseas Chinese <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Global Overseas Chinese Federation received a telegram from San Francisco yesterday,</p>
<p>stating that another fifth batch of over one hundred and fifty distressed overseas Chinese</p>
<p>is scheduled to return home on the Da Lai Company's President Hoover ship on the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, the federation immediately rented a large house near the association</p>
<p>to serve as a temporary shelter. When the distressed overseas Chinese arrive in Shanghai, the federation plans to send personnel to the pier to take care of everything.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Coal Shortage in Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Beipiao and Tangshan Fall</p>
<p>Source Gradually Depleted</p>
<p>Telegraph to Other Coal Mines</p>
<p>To Expedite Shipment of Domestic Coal to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Xinsheng News reports that bituminous coal is the most important fuel. Factories, ships, trains, and other fuels cannot do without it. Since the outbreak of military affairs in North China, both the Kailuan and Beipiao coal mines have been occupied by enemy troops, disrupting freight transportation and causing a shortage of supplies. There is a panic in Shanghai's bituminous coal market. A Xinsheng News reporter visited the committee members of the Coal Industry Association yesterday. According to reports, this port has a large sales volume of bituminous coal. Kailuan household-grade sieved lumps, Kailuan No. 2 sieved lumps, Kailuan No. 1 fines, Kailuan No. 2 fines, and Kailuan special fines are the most popular. Datong Grade 2 Carbon sieved lumps, Datong raw coal sieved lumps, Datong raw coal, Datong fines, and Datong Screenings, and Zhongxing sieved lumps and Zhongxing coal fines are also popular. Changxing sieved lumps, Changxing fines, Jingxing sieved lumps, Jingxing fines, Liuhegou sieved lumps, Liuhegou fines, Huadong sieved lumps, Huadong fines, Huadong raw coal, Boshan Xiaoshan sieved lumps, Boshan sieved lumps, Beipiao sieved lumps, Beipiao fines, Nangshan sieved lumps, and Hongshan fines are also relatively popular. However, Beipiao coal has been temporarily stopped from being shipped to Shanghai due to the impact of the Japanese military occupation. Although Kailuan coal has also been affected, it is still possible to ship it to Shanghai because it is managed by a Sino-British joint venture with a British flag, but the number has decreased. Other coals are being shipped to Shanghai as usual. Moreover, with the imminent ceasefire between China and Japan, transportation will soon be restored, so there is no major shortage of bituminous coal in this city.</p>
<p>Dalu News reports that after the reporter extensively inquired about the coal industry situation in this port yesterday,</p>
<p>he received alarming news that the industry in this port may be greatly hindered soon due to a lack of fuel. According to reliable sources, the coal reserves in this port are now insufficient for one month's use. Normally, there are reserves for two or three months. The reason for this is that the Kailuan Mining Bureau, the main supplier of this port, has temporarily stopped shipping coal. The reporter visited people from Kailuan yesterday. They neither denied nor confirmed the claim of temporarily stopping shipping coal, only saying that the news that can be provided to newspapers must be issued by the Northern General Bureau. According to the news received here, the bureau's miners have fled when the Japanese army advanced to Tangshan, causing production and transportation to be suspended. Regardless of whether this news is reliable or not, the shortage of coal reserves in this port is a definite fact. Yesterday, it was heard that leaders of the industry in this port telegraphed domestic coal mines to expedite shipments to provide relief. The coal mine workers have also agreed to do their best to ensure that coal produced in Shandong and Henan provinces will flow continuously to Shanghai. Even the bankers of this port have agreed to provide financial assistance to facilitate the production and transportation of various mines. According to coal merchants, the amount of Shandong coal and Henan coal coming to Shanghai has greatly increased in recent weeks. However, Henan coal must be transported by the Pinghan Railway to Hankou and then loaded onto ships to Shanghai. Recently, the Pinghan Railway has encountered new difficulties in transportation due to military transport. Shandong coal is transported by the Jinpu Railway, but the cost is too high and the transportation is more difficult. It is now heard that Zhongxing plans to lay 30 miles of railway to connect the Longhai Railway so that it can reach Haizhou from the Longhai Line and then be transported by ship to Shanghai, greatly reducing transportation costs. It is also heard that Zhongxing authorities are consulting with leaders of the financial industry to raise funds, and they have also obtained their consent. Although it will take time for this new development to be completed, it is believed that it can be realized in the short term to alleviate the coal shortage in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Rural Economic Relief <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Banking Association to Hold Meeting This Week to Discuss</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan convened a meeting of the Rural Revival Committee in Beijing on the 5th and</p>
<p>6th of this month to determine the general outline of the measures, and requested the Shanghai Banking Association to establish a Rural Financial Adjustment Committee. The Banking Association is scheduled to</p>
<p>convene a meeting of the Executive Committee this week</p>
<p>to discuss matters related to the establishment of the Rural Financial Adjustment Committee. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter learned from the banking sector that the opinions of the banking sector in this city regarding rural financial adjustment are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Concentrate Efforts <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The banking sector in this city believes that the decline of rural</p>
<p>finance has a great impact on the financial security of the entire country,</p>
<p>and it is imperative to find ways to provide relief. Therefore, the banking sector in this city generally advocates concentrating efforts to carry out the relief, that is, concentrating the efforts of various banks on the Rural Financial Adjustment Committee, which will be responsible for the relief and adjustment matters. However, they fear that the committee will be unable to reach everyone, and the beneficiaries will only be near Shanghai and will not be able to reach all regions.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Conducting Separately <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>There is another group of bankers who advocate that after the establishment of the Agricultural Finance Adjustment Committee, the committee should formulate adjustment measures and separately request each bank to handle matters in various rural areas. For example, Bank A handles matters in area A, and Bank B handles matters in area B. All major banks have branches in various locations and automatically conduct operations by district. The speed of effectiveness is better than the method described in the previous paragraph. However, the disadvantage is that there are concerns about ineffective implementation. The above two opinions will be submitted for discussion at the executive committee meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Farmer Loan Capital <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>As for banks pooling funds to establish farmer loan capital institutions in various rural areas to provide loans to farmers during the lean season, the idea is good. However, it would be unacceptable if those in charge do not understand the purpose of establishing such institutions and instead engage in exploitation. Therefore, the banking community in this city should pay full attention to the preparation of farmer loan capital institutions to avoid such abuses, so as not to lose the original purpose of agricultural finance adjustment and to provide convenience to farmers.</p>
<h3 id="e145">International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Product Exports <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Can be contacted at any time at the Bureau</p>
<p>Manganese powder has a wide range of uses in industry, such as in the production of gas-smelling bleaching powder and disinfectants. It is also needed in considerable quantities in dyeing factories, enamel factories, glass factories, paint factories, and battery factories. According to the International Trade Bureau, a foreign firm in this port requires 100 tons of such manganese powder per month and has written to the bureau to inquire about the addresses of manganese mines to start procurement. In addition, an import company in Canada sent a letter to the bureau requesting a large quantity of soybean flour, requesting samples and quotations in reply. Another import company in Canada is willing to promote Chinese domestic products. An import firm in Belgium is willing to manage various brushes, cotton thread, wool blankets, cosmetics, gloves, household rubber products, and items used in large warehouses, etc. According to the person in charge of the bureau, factories and businesses that have the above products can directly contact the guidance department of the bureau for introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Banking Sector Seeks to Rescue Chinese Yarn <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Three banks will give cash for goods. The government should provide fundamental relief.</p>
<p>Chinese yarn factories are experiencing operational difficulties, leading to reductions in working hours.</p>
<p>The Chinese yarn industry is in a precarious situation. The reasons for its decline have been thoroughly discussed by experts. Recently, the Ministry of Industry, in order to provide relief, will be in contact with national banks to provide loans. According to the banking sector, the revival of the Chinese yarn industry should be resolved by the government through political means. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e147">Bank Relief <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, recently discussed the issue of rescuing Chinese yarn with Kong Xiangxi, Governor of the Central Bank, and agreed that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications would provide loans of 20 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. The Central Bank would be responsible for 4%, and the yarn industry would be responsible for 2%, in order to reduce the burden on the yarn industry and facilitate financial circulation.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Fundamental Solution <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to the banking sector, Chinese banks fundamentally always lend to the yarn industry. Shanghai Bank alone has lent around 20 million, resulting in a situation where the bank's cash has turned into cotton yarn. However, this is not a fundamental solution. If a fundamental rescue of Chinese yarn is desired, the responsibility still lies with the government. The government should abolish all harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies when purchasing raw materials, and then take steps to reduce the cost of the yarn industry through protective tariffs, thereby invisibly raising the status of Chinese yarn, which may be helpful.</p>
<h3 id="e149">British Nationals Celebrate Empire Day Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Attends and Participates in Military Parade</p>
<p>Yesterday was the British "Empire Day". British nationals around the world held celebrations to commemorate the anniversary of the founding of this empire. British nationals in this city also held celebrations as usual. At 7:45 a.m., the Boy Scouts were reviewed at the Consulate General. At noon, a celebration was held at the Shanghai Club. At 5:30 p.m., a military parade was held at the Racecourse. In the evening, a banquet was held at the Metropole Hotel. Mayor Wu, accompanied by his secretary Tang Shixuan, went to the Shanghai Club yesterday at noon to offer congratulations and scheduled to go to the Racecourse at 5:30 p.m. to participate in the military parade.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Westerner Ike Fu Elaborates on Aviation Patriotic Awards <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Forty Years in China Leads to Love for China, Integrity, Value, and Fair Estimation are Welcome</p>
<p>Mr. Ike Fu, a Westerner, out of sympathy for China's national crisis, donated his real estate and antiques to establish aviation patriotic awards, which has aroused social discussion on its methods. It is now heard that Mr. Ike sent another letter to the preparatory office of aviation patriotic awards yesterday, elaborating on everything. The letter said, "To the gentlemen of the preparatory office of aviation patriotic awards: On the evening of the 18th, I was honored to be visited by leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, despite their contempt for me. I have received great speeches from you and many compliments from various newspapers. How can I not say a word? I am sixty years old and have been in China for nearly forty years. I have a friendship with the same state and a sense of respect for the official hat. I have often discussed the depth of China's national crisis with Chinese friends and sought ways to deal with it. Later, with the personal guidance of Mayor Wu and the back-and-forth correspondence of representatives of various groups, this plan to use real estate and antiques as prizes was formed. How to initiate, how to allocate prizes, and how to provide aviation patriotic funds are all decided by you. I have absolutely no preconceived notions. I only know that I will contribute my blood, sweat, and hard work to the best of my ability. As for its quality and value, I welcome knowledgeable people to make a fair assessment, and I will not hesitate to estimate it in any way. However, I do not want to hear public insults such as deception based on ignorance of the truth and stubborn subjectivity. If it is said to be promotion, I have already stated it in a special letter. In this serious time, with the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people and the deep sympathy of foreigners living in China, the number must be considerable. I have already begun to plan the promotion method, and I believe that I will not lag behind others. If the sales cannot be smooth, why can't I make reasonable sacrifices based on the actual agreement? As for large military supplies and airplanes, I have repeatedly stated that I will donate them, and I will always adhere to my original intention no matter what. This can be reported to you. Destroying the family to relieve the country's difficulties is a beautiful story in history. However, in my shallow opinion, the people who eat the country's food and live on the country's land have this obligation when they encounter national difficulties. There is no such thing as a good name, and I don't know what kind of reality there is. Now, because of my love for China, unexpected praise and fault-finding have come one after another. This is really beyond what my foolishness dares to speculate. I offer my heart and speak to the best of my ability. I wish you peace. Ike Fu respectfully bows."</p>

<p>This year's new tea has recently been launched on the market. However, due to the disturbance of the red bandits in the production area, the harvest is poor, and the price is slightly higher than last year. Foreign merchants are waiting and seeing, and sales are sluggish. The first batch of Chinese tea is only 277 tons, which was transported to France by the British Company's Sutan on the previous day. It is said that most of it is black tea.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Five Batches of Antiques Unloaded Yesterday, Not Yet Completed <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Only over Three Thousand Five Hundred Boxes Transported, Remaining Scheduled to Continue This Morning</p>

<h3 id="e153">Concession Factory Inspection Issue, Shanghai Concession Authorities to Begin Negotiations <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Written Opinions to be Delivered to the City Government</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of inspecting factories in the concession, Mayor Wu went to Nanjing a few days ago and consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry. It was decided that, under the principle of not harming China's sovereignty, and for the welfare of all city workers, the Municipal Government would be responsible for conducting sincere negotiations with the concession authorities to establish a cooperative method so that factory inspections could be implemented as soon as possible. It is now learned that Secretary-General Yu met with Mr. Feixindun, Director-General of the Public Concession Bureau, yesterday afternoon to schedule the beginning of negotiations, in the hope that a cooperative method could be produced as soon as possible. It is said that the Shanghai Municipal Council plans to submit its opinions on factory inspections in the concession to the City Government in writing within the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shang Zhen's Representative Cheng Qilu Speaks <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Qilu, representative of Shang Zhen, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army Corps of North China, returned to Beijing from Shanghai last month and rushed to the front to discuss important matters with Shang. Later, Commander-in-Chief Shang believed that the military situation of resisting Japan in North China needed to be reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and sent Cheng to Nanchang to meet Chiang and report on the army's anti-Japanese combat experience and request instructions. The details have been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. Now that Cheng has arrived in Shanghai, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Cheng at his residence. According to him, "I left Beiping on the 29th of last month. At that time, in addition to the fierce fighting that continued for days in the Gubeikou area, the Japanese army in other passes and the Ledong area had been withdrawing continuously since the 23rd of last month. At that time, it was speculated that the reason for their withdrawal was to concentrate their forces to the rear, attempting to pursue and spy on our Sanhe Miyun from the Xinglong area to threaten Pingjin. Therefore, the Military Council transferred our army from the Ledong area to the Tongzhou Sanhe Pinggu area. Because our army had suffered heavy losses after repeated battles and urgently needed to be replenished, we controlled that area. The enemy did not invade. We vowed to fight to the death. Looking back, since our army was ordered to go to Ledong at the end of last year and fought at Lengkou, it has been five months and more than ten fierce battles. The details of the process have been recorded in many Chinese and foreign newspapers. In particular, the Osaka Asahi Shimbun and the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun and other newspapers in the enemy's country paid special attention to the Lengkou campaign and published it in great detail, so there is no need to repeat it. In this campaign, the enemy used new-style weapons, and we relied on the spirit of sacrifice to fight steel with flesh and blood. The losses had already been taken into account. However, comparing the casualties of both sides, the enemy may have exceeded ours. According to statistics, the casualties of the Huang Gao Division and the Huang Division, which were fighting on the front line, were about two-fifths and one-third, respectively. On average, more officers were killed, because many officers committed suicide in anger after being injured. Reports said that although the initial ceasefire was said to be about to be realized, if the Japanese side put forward excessive conditions, forcing us to form an alliance under the city, our side would not yield, and how could the Japanese side get what they wanted? If unfortunately the peace talks cannot succeed, there is no other way but to defend Pingjin to the death and implement the determination to fight with our backs to the city. At this time of national crisis and people's suffering, when survival is at stake, the fundamental plan is still for the whole country to be of one mind and work together to open up a way out, so that we can overcome this difficulty and save the crisis." According to Cheng, "The Jiangxi communist bandits were quite rampant in the past. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally supervised the suppression, the bandit forces have been greatly reduced. The method of suppressing bandits must be to encircle and suppress with military force, and at the same time, pay attention to political methods to seek fundamental eradication."</p>
<h3 id="e155">City Chamber of Commerce Commends Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industries for Discovering Japanese Iron <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>A Stern Warning Sent to the Iron Industry Association</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, based on the report from the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industries Association that Japanese iron was being dumped in Shanghai, sent personnel to secretly investigate. As a result, 600 tons have been discovered. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter of commendation and a stern warning to the Iron Industry Association. The two letters are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Commendation to Machinery Industry: Received a letter stating that Japanese iron <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>is being dumped in Shanghai. After investigating various factories, more than 600 tons have been discovered. The iron has been strictly sealed and transported to a suitable location to await processing. Your association's public investigation and handling of factories privately importing Japanese iron is consistent with your words and deeds, and you have set a good example. We are very impressed and gratified. In addition to sending another letter to the Iron Industry Association, instructing them to cooperate in investigating and blocking the source, we are writing to inform you first. To the Shanghai City Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industries Association.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Warning to the Iron Industry: We received a letter from the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industries Association on the 23rd of this month, stating that <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>it received a letter from your association on September 27 of last year, ordering each industry association to establish a branch of the National Goods Promotion Committee. The association immediately began preparations. However, recently, enemy iron has been dumped in this port, and the value of each ton has fallen by more than 20 yuan. Some colleagues have been bewitched and have privately imported it from time to time. Therefore, personnel were sent to various factories for strict investigation. As a result, about 600 tons of enemy iron have been discovered and sealed up. It is planned to transport them to a suitable location to await processing. We would like to know if this is appropriate, and we hope to get your instructions. However, the sale of this kind of enemy iron must go through iron merchants. If you do not investigate the source, but only focus on the end, it is not a fundamental way to block the source. For this reason, we are writing to ask you to order the Iron Industry Association to thoroughly investigate and assist together, and instruct them to give a concrete answer to clarify the situation. We find that the Japanese are making repeated efforts to plot against our Pingjin, but the five-minute enthusiasm of the Chinese people seems to have passed. You, as leaders of the group, are also asked to work hard to move forward to fulfill the long-standing reputation of our nation, which is our best prayer. We received a letter from the meeting stating that the economic severance with Japan was decided at the extraordinary member representatives' meeting in September 20th. Two years have passed since then. Why is it that even now, your colleagues are still selling Japanese iron to machinery factories? It is likely that you have forgotten and have not earnestly followed the order. You are one of the industry leaders of the association, and you are also a member of this association. You have the responsibility to fulfill the resolutions of the general meeting and to earnestly investigate at any time. Since this matter has been publicly investigated and truthfully reported by the Machinery Industry Association, it concerns the rescue of the national crisis. Your association should have the determination to do what is right and not let the association be beautiful in front of you. You must immediately and thoroughly investigate your colleagues and give strict warnings. You should also report the results of the investigation to be reviewed. This is very important. To the Iron Industry Association.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Brick and Ash Industry Association previously stated that Qu Yiqi, director of the Shanghai Dental Tax Collection Office, forced the industry to receive two licenses. They repeatedly stated that their business was not prosperous and submitted a report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting the Ministry of Finance to still follow the previous case of receiving one license jointly. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance approved the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the brick and ash industry should still follow the old case of receiving one license jointly. The original text is recorded as follows: To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the case was found that the hospital previously telegraphed that the Shanghai Dental Tax Collection Office had to order the brick and ash industry to receive two licenses separately and requested correction. It has already been consulted by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to transfer it to the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office to order it to still be handled in accordance with the established case and to telegraph the association on its behalf. Now, it is approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Consultation No. 44, stating that since the Shanghai brick and ash industry has been approved by the Education Management Office to jointly receive one license, how can the Shanghai Dental Tax Collection Office still order separate receipt, which is not in compliance. In addition to sending a letter to the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office to immediately order the Dental Tax Collection Office to still comply with the established case, it should also be responded to, so please check and follow. Printed by the Ministry of Finance, it is appropriate to order the association to be informed.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Creditors of the Day and Night Bank Urge Auction of Huang Chu Jiu's Estate <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Creditors of the Day and Night Bank's Great World Amusement Savings Department, formerly represented by lawyer Yan Luqing in a lawsuit, have waited for over three years. Of all the debts, only 20% was repaid by the former French Concession court. Since the case was taken over by the Second Special District Local Court, nearly two years have passed, and not a single cent of debt has been repaid. Now, with the upcoming abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, the creditors are in urgent need of funds. Therefore, they have once again commissioned lawyer Yan to submit a petition to the Second Special Court, requesting the speedy auction of Huang Chu Jiu's estate, so as to compensate the creditors as soon as possible. The general gist of the petition states that they earnestly request a swift auction of Huang Chu Jiu's estate to repay the debts. The case has been ongoing for nearly three years, and the impoverished and helpless creditors have only received 20% from the former French Concession court. Moreover, since the case was taken over by your court, it has already been two years, and not a single cent has been repaid. The petitioners are in urgent need of funds as the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival approaches, yet Huang Chu Jiu's real estate has not been auctioned. Furthermore, it has been found that all of Huang's real estate is mortgaged to others. The only hope for the petitioners, as ordinary creditors, is the remaining amount after the auction proceeds are used to repay the mortgages. And the sooner the remaining amount is repaid, the more it depends on when your court holds the auction. The petitioners, being in urgent need of funds, have repeatedly submitted petitions urging the auction, but your court has not actively carried out the auction. Therefore, they are submitting another petition, earnestly requesting that you consider the extreme poverty of the petitioners and expedite the auction as soon as possible, so that the savings can be repaid at an early date.</p>

<p>Lawyer Cao Lin was previously entrusted by Deng Baoyuan to</p>

The next day, he hired a car to transport the goods to the French Concession to hide them. Shen reported the case to the police, who recovered the stolen goods. He also sued Cao, stating that his actions were a serious violation of the law, and the First Special District Local Court investigated the matter, as reported in the newspaper.

<p>Measures to Reduce Silk Cocoon Freight Rates on Two Railways</p>
<p>Silk Cocoon Groups Notify Members that Prices Set are Cheaper than Shipping</p>
<p>Cocoon merchants in various parts of Zhejiang have now started weighing cocoons, and the prices set are 27 yuan per dan for top grade and 25 yuan per dan for second grade. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Huitong Transportation Company loaded the first batch of spring cocoons at the Chang'an Station, totaling 138 packages. They were transported to the South Station for unloading. They were purchased by the Chang'an Xinshun Cocoon Firm and delivered to the Shanghai Fuchang Silk Factory. It is reported that most of this year's spring cocoons are produced from improved silkworm breeds, with large and firm cocoons. However, due to the harvest in various places, the overall yield is only half, mainly due to the cold weather, which has reduced the harvest. Due to cost considerations and low market prices, silkworm farmers are temporarily unwilling to sell easily and are waiting for prices to rise. Therefore, although various cocoon firms have started weighing and buying, there is no crowding. The railway authorities, in order to protect cocoon merchants and increase transportation business, have specially reduced the freight rates for these goods, changing the calculation of freight charges to third-class goods, which were originally calculated as second-class goods. Therefore, most of this year's cocoon transport is by train to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The decline of the silk cocoon industry in recent years has reached an extreme point. The size of the freight rate is closely related to the cost of raw silk. Therefore, representatives of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Railways and the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus to reduce freight rates in order to maintain the industry. Director Yu of the Ministry of Railways and the directors of the two railway bureaus all recognized that Chinese silk is an important part of foreign trade and that in this economic downturn, it is appropriate to reduce freight rates to assist the development of the silk cocoon industry and benefit transportation by reducing costs. Yesterday, the Ministry issued an approval to charge according to the third-class freight rate, which is cheaper than shipping. For example, loading at the Zha Kou Gate and being responsible for transporting to the North Station, including loading and unloading fees and delivering by car to the foreign firm or silk factory, the standard is 48.8 cents per package of 40 Jin (Chinese pound) . Gongchen Bridge is 47.3 cents per package, Chang'an is 43.1 cents per package, Xieqiao is 42.5 cents per package, and Jiaxing is 36.3 cents per package. The same applies to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The freight rate from the starting station to Shanghai, including delivery to the foreign firm or silk factory, is 51.5 cents per package from Nanjing, 44.8 cents per package from Zhenjiang, 37.2 cents per package from Changzhou, and 32.9 cents per package from Wuxi. This is based on a standard weight of 40 Jin per package. If shipping from Wuxi, as in the past when each package only weighed 36 Jin, then each package is only 30.4 cents. The above-mentioned responsible delivery method was negotiated and implemented by silk industry leaders and the railway bureau, so that silk merchants in the interior can directly report to the station for loading after completing the cocoon collection, which can avoid the losses caused by the lack of vehicles and waiting for cars, and can also save the various procedures such as sending friends to pick up goods at the South Railway Station. Therefore, since the implementation of the new regulations, all stations on the two railways are preparing empty cars to wait, in order to achieve the purpose of loading as soon as possible, and it is stipulated that all goods will be transported to the Shanghai North Railway Station, and after unloading, they will be directly moved onto the car and sent directly to the foreign firm or silk factory according to the instructions of the cocoon merchant at the time of loading, to complete the procedures. If there is theft in transit, the railway bureau is responsible for compensation. Therefore, when loading the car, the cocoon packages must be weighed one by one and handed over to the stationmaster to clarify the responsibility. The above methods are being notified to the members of the Shanghai and Wuxi Silk Factory Trade Unions and the Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Federation for their reference. It is also learned that the railway bureau is publishing the freight rates in the newspaper to inform the public.</p>

<p>Child Welfare Series, produce picture models, lantern slides, and films,</p>
<p>promote the 4-4 Children's Day, and promote the child welfare movement, a Publicity Group was established. Recently, in order to actively popularize child welfare undertakings throughout the country, it is particularly necessary to seek the support of the government. Therefore, President Lin Sen of the National Government was invited to be the honorary president, and more than 30 leaders from Shanghai Mayor Wu and all walks of life in the country, such as Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Qingrun, Li Zushen, Xu Shiying, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Boling, He Hengfu, and Zhong Rongguang, were invited to be honorary directors. There are plans to establish child welfare branches in the next five years, convene a national child welfare leadership meeting, establish large-scale model child welfare education centers in the capital and Shanghai, promote workers' nurseries, establish children's hospitals, petition the National Government to formulate children's laws, establish children's courts, and establish children's affairs bureaus, such as the Children's Welfare Committee already established in Shanghai. Tonight, the association's charity ball held at Yiyuan, which raises money by selling tickets, is just the beginning. The most important thing is to awaken the Shanghai gentry to recognize the importance and universality of child welfare, and invite them to come together to promote and implement it. As President Kong of the association once said, "This association attaches great importance to promoting, publicizing, contacting, and gathering everyone to do it together, and has already done it separately in this way. For example, the work in Hankou last year, the work in North China this year, and the current charity ball, etc., can be used as evidence." This charity ball has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life, and the promotion and assistance of various parties have been reported in previous newspapers. In addition to major stores, large companies, and enthusiastic individuals donating large and valuable prizes, they also donated advertising space to publish news. For example, the American Bank, the China Business Corporation, the American Ford Motor Company, the Xinli Company, the Cathay Hotel, the Huizhong Silver Company, the China Public Bus Company, the Shanghai Electrical Construction Company, the British American Tobacco Company, the William's Large Room, the Cooper &amp; Company, and Mrs. Benaedict, etc. Shanghai's major newspapers, such as Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shishi Xinbao, Chen Bao, and Min Bao, have devoted many pages to vigorous publicity. The scale of the event is unprecedented. The Children's Morning Post sent dozens of copies of the Children's Morning Post compilation printed in five colors to help child welfare education. The Municipal Education Bureau specially sent Hu Shuyi to film the event. The Weili Company's Dali Fruit Milk Powder and Flower Fans will also serve as a way to promote child hygiene. The event will start at 9:30 tonight, and dinner will be served at any time at the guests' convenience. In addition to Kong Xiangxi's speech and Mei Lanfang's performance of "Ci Hu", there will also be black twin brothers</p>

<p>Mr. Rui Dexian, a student of Tongji University, went</p>
<p>to Germany to study with a German professor from the school five years ago. He entered the Fanma Industrial University to study electrical engineering. In 1932, he obtained the degree of both strong and weak electrical engineer at the same time, and won the first place in the exam, winning the highest award, which is a rare honor among Chinese students studying abroad. With the introduction of the school authorities, he went to major factories in Germany, France, and Italy for internships, gaining more experience. Mr. Rui is extremely intelligent and created a wireless recording machine in his spare time, which he applied for a patent with the German Patent Bureau and obtained a patent certificate. It is reported that he will arrive in Shanghai on June 5th aboard the Italian Post Office's Count Rhodes, and will contribute to the country and society in the future.

<p>Shipowners Should Be Aware</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Tax Commissioner issued a notice yesterday, stating that in order to announce matters, the government has ordered that all Chinese merchant ship steering gear orders (i.e., emergency driving command orders used to communicate with the helmsman) should be implemented with direct meaning from May of this year. For example, when the ship is moving forward and the rudder wheel and bow are to turn to the right, the English word RIGHT should be used to command it. Conversely, if the rudder wheel and bow are to turn to the left, the English word LEFT should be used to command it. As for ships using manual steering, the command orders used must also be implemented uniformly, that is, RIGHT means commanding the rudder blade and bow to the right, LEFT means commanding the rudder blade and bow to the left, etc. Therefore, all shipowners should be aware of this, and this notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Regularly Maritime Pirates Loot Fishing Boats <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Yongbo Fishing Association Petitioned to Send Warships to Pursue and Arrest</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Industry Improvement Association and the Jiangzhe District Fisheries Administration in this city</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to the Yinxian Fishing Association's petition, member Zheng Gensheng reported that when the people went fishing at sea, they hired four large pairs of ships. On the 17th of this month, they were transported to Xiaobanshan in Dinghai County (after unloading the goods, they were preparing to turn back the empty ships when a pirate ship passed by. Eight bandits, each holding a handgun, looted several empty ships. One ship was released, stating that each ship would cost 120 yuan, and the money would be paid off within five days. Otherwise, the three ships will be confiscated, etc., so I urgently reported to the meeting. In the fishing season, the livelihood of the fishing industry depends on the proceeds at this time to live on, but in this era of piracy, looting is repeated. Fishermen go out to sea to fish, and they are deeply worried, anxious, and trembling. I hope that our government will give them real protection, ensure water security, and make them feel at ease and happy, and engage in production. Then the news came, and it turned out to be the opposite. My fishermen's hope will be lost from now on. Recently, the government has collected a fishing industry construction fee, which is not a small amount. One is to purchase patrol ships to protect fishermen, and the other is to take it from fishing and use it for fishing. However, what we see and hear is that fishing boats are being robbed and fishermen are being looted, which is still the case. Therefore, there is a reason why the number of fishing boats has been sharply reduced and the fishing industry has declined this year. If we do not seek remedies quickly and try to recover, our country's fishing industry will be reduced to a place of no recovery and will never be revived. According to the previous situation reported, it is reasonable to prepare a document and submit it to the authorities to order their subordinates to send warships to pursue and arrest in order to protect fishermen and eliminate piracy, etc. After receiving the report, the association and bureau ordered the warships to protect them separately, and also sent a letter to the Outer Sea Water Police Branch to instruct each team to assist.</p>

<p>丨Eight Resolutions on Important Matters丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yangzhou Eight Counties Association of fellow villagers, located in Renji Lane, Xinzha Road, invited representatives from local groups and committee members to a meeting at 3 PM yesterday to discuss the direction of negotiations regarding the Gao case. More than 40 representatives from various circles attended. Shen Dingchen, the representative of the association, was elected as chairman and reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Song Shixiang reported that after receiving the request letter from Gao Yuanlin, the father of the deceased Gao, the association had previously discussed providing assistance and requested the court for a re-examination through lawyers, which was not approved. However, a copy of the court's autopsy report had been received and should be studied first. Next, Committee Member Jian Shusheng said that according to the court's inspection, it was initially said that there were no injuries, but after the second internal autopsy, there was blood in the lung cavity, which was therefore identified as lung disease, but the lower part of the injured area was not examined, so further research was still needed. Next, Committee Member Jiao Chen reported on the petition to the municipal government, which was very successful. Then, the chairman reported that lawyer Zhu Gaorong, a fellow villager, had sent a letter expressing his willingness to participate in the assistance. Next, Mr. Tang, the representative of the barbers' association, reported on his views on the Gao case negotiations. Subsequently, representatives from various groups, such as Chen Guoliang and Yi Lizhang, successively expressed their opinions on the handling of the Gao case. After full discussion, the following decisions were made: (1) The court's appraisal report will be sent to the medical association and fellow villager Dr. Lu for detailed study, and then a protest will be filed with the court. (2) An Aid Gao Yatou Tragedy Support Association of all circles in Shanghai will be organized, and each group and fellow villagers' association will be invited to nominate one or two responsible representatives to participate in the meeting. (3) Collect evidence after the Gao case occurred in preparation for filing a protest with the court, and ask the municipal government to negotiate seriously based on the facts. (4) Establish a legal research association, scheduled to invite lawyers to participate in discussions on May 26. (5) Summon witnesses to truthfully prove the circumstances of the matter. (6) Request newspapers to publicize the news of the Gao case negotiations as much as possible, and regularly invite journalists to hold a tea party, the date to be determined by the association. (7) Jointly seal and submit a public letter to the municipal government and diplomatic organs by major groups to negotiate with the French authorities. (8) Distribute the court's appraisal report to all circles for research and solicit opinions. All the above cases were unanimously approved for execution. Finally, Mr. Lu, the representative of the Quanzhang Middle School teachers and students association, reported on the destruction of the school by the school board, the case was serious, and requested assistance. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM after the discussion.</p>

<p>Zhang Desheng, a Shandong foreman in the tobacco leaf room of the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, because</p>
<p>On March 20th, at 9 AM, taking advantage of the labor dispute, he used barbaric means to gather Li A Jin, Li Gui, and others, and severely injured five staff members of the tin packaging department, including Li Zhitang and Li Chengyao, with iron rods. After the incident, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Patrol Room arrested Zhang and the two Lis and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. The three defendants, Zhang and others, were sentenced to six months in prison each, and Zhang's agent lawyer requested to reserve the right to appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Second High Court Criminal Division, along with judges Jiang and Zhou, came to court for a re-examination. Gan Jingxian, the patrol room lawyer, Wu Linkun, the legal advisor of the factory, and Zheng Wenkai, Zhang's defense lawyer, were all present on time. According to Zhang Desheng, he was unwilling to appeal, and Zheng lawyer then withdrew the case. Lawyer Wu stated that he would also withdraw the incidental private prosecution against Zhang. Judge Yu instructed Zhang Desheng to declare that he had not appealed and requested execution on May 23 according to the first instance judgment. This labor dispute farce has come to an end.</p>

<p>丨Request a Reasonable Negotiation, Punishment of the Murderer, and Compensation丨</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jiading Association of fellow villagers, regarding the tragic death of Jiading native Lu Yuanquan, who was shot and killed by Italian Marine Corps trainees practicing shooting on the morning of the 23rd of this month, immediately sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association requesting a reasonable negotiation to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderer and providing compensation after sending personnel to investigate. The letter from the association to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association is recorded as follows: We are writing to inform you that at about 10 AM on the morning of the 23rd, the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai was practicing shooting near the target range at the end of North Sichuan Road. Our fellow villager Lu Yuanquan, 42 years old, was engaged in flower planting on rented land at No. 2 Xitiyu Road, Jiangwan Road. At that time, he was inspecting the flower beds when a bullet suddenly flew in and shot in from his forehead, piercing through the back of his head, and he died instantly. After our association learned of this, we immediately sent people to investigate and learned that Lu Yuanquan's family had no permanent property, and his funeral arrangements were desolate. He has an elderly mother above and a wife below, and several members of his family will be left without support from now on. This unexpected tragic death is truly pitiful. Although it is said that the Italian Marine Corps did not intentionally kill him, shooting also has regulations, and the flower beds are not targets. Disregarding human life is a deserving crime, and compensation for the orphaned should be generous. Therefore, we are writing to request your association to negotiate reasonably: (1) Punish the Italian soldier who accidentally injured Lu Yuanquan. (2) Provide generous compensation to Lu Yuanquan's family. We believe that your association has always upheld justice and will do its best to carry out this task and speak out against this injustice for the innocent civilians who died tragically. Sincerely yours, to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association.</p>

<p>Xu Chengyu's Tianfeng Pavilion Poems Published Mr. Xu Chengyu of Hanchuan,</p>
<p>Deeply versed in Chinese studies, his "Commentary on Chinese Philosophy" and "Outline of Chinese Studies" have long been famous at home and abroad. He also writes poetry in his spare time, which is unique. Modern people's poetry, if not diseased, falls into stereotypes, or is delicate and charming, but only takes on vulgarity. The correct sound and elegance have disappeared for a time. Mr. Chengyu has made great efforts to correct the bad habits of the time and follow the example of the three Tangs. In the past, old man Fanshan inscribed a poem saying, "The text embellishes the landscape and requires this talent. Shen Xiong's lofty style runs like wind and thunder. Who will continue the sorrow of Chu? A volume of new poems counts the jade platforms." Mr. Lin Gongduo of Ruian inscribed a poem saying, "Song continued the Tang style and this hegemony talent. Sima Kong's products are also leisurely. The magnificent and elegant are all unusual. I dance for this person." From these two titles, you can know the poems of the gentleman. The literary world at home and abroad should be the first to see it. The complete collection contains more than 400 ancient and modern poems, exquisitely made into one volume, priced at one yuan, and sold by Shanghai Huatong Bookstore.</p>

<p>▲Large Gifts from Yang Umbrella Sales Office The China National Goods Yang Umbrella Joint Sales Office in Jixiang Lane, Jiru Lane, Fada Road, has been developing well since its opening. The products produced are entirely made of domestic raw materials, which have been confirmed by various national goods groups, and a special stable national goods mark is printed on the products. Regardless of whether they are transported to foreign ports or the mainland, they are unimpeded and welcomed by those who love national goods. It is not like other companies that use inferior goods to deceive and are seized. It is now heard that Mr. Sheng Zhiren, the general manager of the office, in order to achieve the lasting plan of promoting national goods, is sparing no expense to prepare to present special prizes worth tens of thousands of yuan from June 1st to reward compatriots for their enthusiasm in promoting and patronizing national goods. The method of giving prizes is that for every dozen umbrellas purchased, one prize ticket will be given, and so on. The winning numbers are based on the standards of the International Savings Society's number list. The special prize for the full sheet can get a gift worth 10,000 yuan. There are many prizes, and even the small prizes include this brand of national goods umbrellas. In this critical moment of national crisis, saving the country with material things is an important plan for the people, and in addition to this special gift, I think all sectors of society who sympathize with the national goods salvation will be especially satisfied and happy to hear this news.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Mr. Editor: Today, your newspaper published a news item about the reorganization of our association by the Seamen's Special Party Department, which does not conform to the facts. According to the party's appointed Chen Songnian and other seven people, on the afternoon of the 19th, at 7 PM, when no one was in charge of our association, they led a large number of police officers to our association, pried open the cabinet windows, and forcibly took away official documents and books. Based on the facts, our association did not hand over any part of it and should request a correction. With endless friendship, to the editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper, the Shanghai Branch of the China Seamen's Industrial United General Association Organizing Committee. To the esteemed Mr. Editor: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper a report on a brawl among coolies at the Lantai Chimney Pier in Pudong, which mentioned a gang led by Zhu Zuoshu, a coal-carrying coolie from the Kaiping Bureau. After investigation, there is no such person as Zhu Zuoshu among the workers managing the Kaiping Bureau pier. Only I am named Zhu Zhushu, and I have served at the pier for many years and have never heard of anything external. That morning, I went to a friend's place in Puxi to reciprocate, and returned only at midnight, which is known to my colleagues. I am deeply afraid of confusion and damage to my personal reputation, so I specially write this letter to you, and ask the editor to be especially considerate and make a correction. Zhu Zhushu, May 24th.</p>
<p>We are writing to inform you that on the 21st of this month, we read in your newspaper an article about a visit to the First Special District Women's Prison, which stated that "although the number of prisoners is increasing day by day, the prison food is still the fixed quota of one hundred and several tens of mouths in the past, so it is quite difficult to allocate it." After investigation, the prison food item of our prison originally budgeted for 170 people. If the number of prisoners exceeds this, the extra food expenses have always been applied for according to the number of people, and there is no difficulty in allocating it. We should request a correction accordingly. Sincerely yours, the Jiangsu Second Prison Branch, May 24th.</p>
<p>Da Feng Company sent a letter to this newspaper saying: We are writing to inform you that we were deeply shocked to read in your newspaper that our company's John Cudworth vessel should be liable for a collision with the He'an vessel. We cannot but believe that the rumors are mistaken. Enclosed are two letters from our company to the owner of the He'an vessel dated May 20th and 22nd, which will show that our company believes that the owner of the He'an vessel should be fully responsible for the collision. We have asked them to send personnel to assess the damage suffered by the John Cudworth vessel, and our company will demand compensation from the owner of the He'an vessel for this damage. We should ask your newspaper to correct the previous record and publish the enclosed two letters in the same way. We are grateful for this. Da Feng Company, May 24th. (Enclosed Letter 1) "May 20th, Da Feng to He Tai" We are writing to inform you that at 9:45 this morning, our company's John Cudworth vessel collided with the He'an vessel in the Huangpu River. As a result, our ship was severely damaged, and we heard that the He'an also sank. We also know that your company's vessel should be fully responsible for the collision, so we specially write to request that you bear all losses and the consequences of the collision. (Enclosed Letter 2) "May 22nd, Da Feng to He Tai" We are writing to inform you that regarding the sections mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter of May 20th, our company firmly denies any liability of any kind mentioned therein, and requests that your company bear all losses and consequences arising from the collision between the John Cudworth and He'an vessels, because this collision was entirely due to the error in navigation of your vessel. We hereby request your company to send appraisers to the Lime Port Pier to inspect the damage to our vessel and estimate the repair costs.</p>

<p>丨Letter from Mr. Tian Chongshi of Yichang丨</p>
<p>I see many difficult questions in your column, and you answer them all. I also have many things now, please give me detailed instructions. I am now eighteen years old. In the past seven years, life was quite good. My father was a businessman and sent me to a private school for three or four years. Later, due to the sluggish market, there was no business, and my father became addicted to opium and various other habits, deteriorating day by day, turning a happy family into a place where "there is no rice for the chickens by day, and no rats steal food at night!" My father, affected by economic hardship, had no choice but to go out to seek a living. He abandoned my mother, me, my younger sister, and brother. My mother sold all the things in the house to survive! Hoping that my father would send money back, but he never sent a penny home in two years. My mother thought there was no way to make a living, let alone money for my studies, so she asked someone to introduce me to an apprenticeship. Later, my uncle sent me to a machine-made noodle factory to learn the trade, but after entering the shop, there was no business acumen to be seen at all. I was only thirteen years old at the time, with little knowledge, and I didn't refuse. Later, I gradually felt that this kind of business was not clever at all, and even those who had never learned it could do it. I told my mother several times that I didn't want to do it, but my mother said, because of economic difficulties, wouldn't we starve if we went home? So she coaxed me, saying that every profession produces an expert, don't worry, after three years of apprenticeship, you can borrow some money and start your own business. So I slowly continued to work, but my ability to study was gone. I only studied writing and arithmetic during those three years. But the shop owner didn't even subscribe to a newspaper, so my progress in learning was hindered. Seeing that three years had passed, I decided not to do it anymore. Without telling my mother, I quit my job with the shop owner and moved all my bedding back home. At that time, my mother couldn't do anything about it. Soon, my father also came back. My mother tried to help him find a way to do business, and as a result, he opened an opium den, earning half a dollar a day, which was enough to make a small living. I thought it wouldn't be a long-term solution to stay at home, so I asked someone to introduce me to a general store to work. The general store was a little better than the noodle factory. But the initial wage was very low, only two dollars a month to take home. Saving carefully, it could be used for three days. Now, a ban on opium has suddenly arisen in Yichang, and all opium businesses are not allowed. My father is unwilling to do anything other than run an opium den, and there is no way to pay for living expenses. Even if I take my wages home to use, where will the money for the remaining twenty-seven days come from? My mother is also sick with worry, and the scene of not eating for three days and not lighting a fire for two days has also come. I thought to myself that I don't have any other skills at this time, how can I earn more money? I want to ask the shop owner for more wages, but on the one hand, the boss's business is not good, and on the other hand, I don't have much ability, so how can I deserve more money? I want to do business, but I don't have any capital. If I don't take care of my family, wouldn't the whole family starve to death? If I take care of them, I don't have that much strength. You see how dangerous my future and present are! I have been wanting to write this letter for a long time, and I only wrote it tonight. Please have mercy on me and think of a way for me.</p>
<p>Answer: After reading your letter, we feel really sad. To plan for you, you can only use the wages you earn as living expenses for your mother, and you can ignore your father. We don't need to have any sympathy for opium addicts, they have become a social burden. If your mother has two dollars a month, she can wash clothes for others, or do some needlework, and she won't starve. In the vast sea of people, without solving the fundamental problems of the whole society, there is no other good way for your situation.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 24th) The Ministry of Education, based on the petitions from the education departments of Hunan, Jiangsu, and other provinces requesting changes to the elementary school joint examination methods, finds them quite reasonable and has approved the changes. Elementary schools may, depending on local conditions, not hold joint examinations.</p>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai, Director of Jiangsu Education Department</p>
<h3 id="e195">Letter to Students Taking the Joint Examination <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Fo-hai, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, wrote to the students taking this year's graduation joint examination, saying, "To all third-year vocational students in the province: The academic atmosphere in Jiangsu has always been simple and honest, and the talent and morale are superior to other provinces. You are the lifeblood of the country and the focus of the national spirit. You should understand the difficulties of family burdens and have a long-term view of your personal future. How should you study hard and abide by the law? Recently, I heard that a small number of students have begun to doubt this year's joint examination, either questioning the system itself or the subject matter, or even abandoning their studies, secretly running around, publishing leaflets, and spreading them widely. This not only damages the virtues of young people's hard work but also betrays the original intention of the country's encouragement. The joint examination system is a legacy of Prime Minister Sun's examination ideas and a major policy promulgated by the country. It is intended to promote teaching efficiency, select true talents, and improve culture. This is already well known to you. In all areas where education is developed, it is universally followed, such as Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, Anhui, and the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. There are only differences in timing, but few cases of defiance. Jiangsu's education is admired throughout the country, how can we willingly lag behind and not be a leader for the country? As for why you doubt the joint examination, some say that the standards are too high and the time is too short. However, the standards for each subject were all formulated by the principals of secondary schools in this province after careful consultation, and the longest subjects were selected from each school to compile them, which were then submitted to this department for review and promulgation. Moreover, the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry have long been the basis for teaching in each school. This department is still worried that they may not be fully suitable for the current situation in Jiangsu, so each school has conducted repeated research and jointly formulated the standards in order to reduce difficulties and make them easier to implement. This cannot be said to be prudent and thorough. Moreover, for all systems, when they are first created, there must be people who are 'loyal and devoted to the law' to break the traditional mentality of 'it is easy to enjoy success, but difficult to plan the beginning.' Young people are the vanguard of the revolution, and scholars are the model for the whole people. If they lack this kind of spirit and courage of 'loyalty and devotion to the law,' they carelessly ignore the country's good laws and intentions, and are suspicious of everything. Those who know may think that your minds are driven by emotions, and that the majority are hijacked by the minority, which leads to their sighing. Those who do not know may directly think that you are afraid of difficulties and seek ease, and are cowardly, like the truancy of students in elementary school, which is ridiculed by those who know. People all over the country, who once praised Jiangsu's education and expected Jiangsu's youth, will soon leave in disappointment. Is this what this department and you want to hear? In the past year or two, perhaps because of the many misfortunes of the country, or because of the special circumstances of each school and place, you have not been able to study with peace of mind. This department is well aware of this pain. However, the joint examination system is a major national policy, and this department strictly abides by the law and is determined to implement it without hesitation or delay. At the same time, the love for you is like a father and brother comforting their children, and we cannot allow indulgence to cause lifelong harm. How can there be any feelings of destroying and hurting flesh and blood? Therefore, for anything that is truly beneficial to you, even if you do not see it, we will do our best to plan it and have more than enough. For anything that is truly harmful to you, even if you all like it, we will do our best to eliminate it and make it thorough. Therefore, for the implementation of this joint examination, we will act according to reason and discretion, and be considerate and comprehensive. We never want to see the country's best system become a thorn in the side of young people, and we especially cannot bear to see pure and lovely young people become meat on the chopping block. If we are not insane, how can we deliberately make things difficult for you and deliberately make the majority of you fail? This is not only unreasonable, but also how can we feel at ease? From junior high school to senior high school, you have worked hard for six long years. Now that graduation is near, how should you cherish this long-term, arduous effort, resolutely participate in the joint examination to complete your achievements and seek advancement? If you stubbornly cling to your prejudices and abandon yourselves, then the Ministry of Education's orders and the provincial government's resolutions are clearly visible. Those who do not participate in the joint examination, although they will not be forced to participate, will definitely not be allowed to graduate. Your years of time will be destroyed in one day, and your parents' full hopes will be in vain. Even if this department wants to do its best to save you, it will not be possible. If there are still those who hold onto the crowd and force others to rebel, then they are a scourge to the community, easily breeding problems, destroying laws and disciplines, and disrupting order. National laws and decrees will never be lenient. Where to go and what to do, you should be especially vigilant. I hope you will deeply reflect, concentrate on studying, and prepare for the exam. In the past, when Ran Qiu helped Ji, Confucius, after much regret, said that the young men should beat the drums and attack him. Before Zhou Chu killed the dragon, who knew that he had the courage to change his ways and strengthen himself? I urge you to strive for this. I sincerely tell you, please be aware of it."</p>

<p>▲ Mayor Wu, Commander Dai, and Others Serve as Reviewing Officers</p>

<p>▲ Review Order Reviewing officers: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department Tong Xingbai, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Wen Hong'en, etc. The order of review is as follows: (1) Order to prepare, (2) Assembly, (3) Music, (4) All stand at attention, (5) Flag raising, (6) Sing the Party Song, (7) Give the highest salute to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the Prime Minister, (8) The Chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will, (9) Silent tribute, (10) Review, (A) Report the number of people, (B) Separation ceremony, (C) Basic movement exercises, (D) Marching formation, (11) Chairman's speech, (12) Admonition, (13) Speech, (14) Sing the Boy Scout song, (15) Music, (16) Cheers, (17) Photography, (18) Performance, (19) Dismissal.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor's Admonition After the review, Chairman Zheng Xigu gave a speech, followed by Mayor Wu's admonition, which roughly stated: "Today, the Shanghai Boy Scouts are holding a review in front of the citizens of Shanghai. The important significance of this is to constantly review the strength of our citizens. Boy Scouts are our Chinese students, well-trained young people, and future social cadres and national pillars. The responsibility they bear is very great. During your schooling, you are receiving education and increasing your knowledge and abilities, in order to be prepared to shoulder the great responsibility of the country in the future. In the past few decades, because our ancestors did not work hard, or their efforts were ineffective and fruitless, today China is divided and oppressed by the Japanese. Although our military and civilians have always resisted, they still cannot defeat the Japanese. This is entirely because China was not prepared in the past 100 years, which is why we are suffering today. If we are thinking about the future Republic of China, we must cultivate strength now, and this strength is in you. You are like a tree, a flower, a tender flower. The country cultivates you in order to make you grow into pillars, so I hope that you will make great aspirations, make great preparations, and take on the responsibility of saving China in the future. Today, seeing that the Shanghai Boy Scouts have such good training, it is really the hope of China's future. I also hope that you will continue to work hard to exercise your bodies and increase your knowledge, and become good citizens of China in the future."</p>
<p>▲ Dai's Admonition Commander Dai's admonition roughly stated: "I am very happy to be here today to participate. China today is not only getting worse year by year, but almost day by day. The most hopeful for those who bear the responsibility of saving the country are young people, and they need strong and high-spirited young people. Looking at Germany during the European War, after the war, the national armed forces were completely disbanded, but today Germany's position is very important. This is all due to the efforts of the German people. This spirit of hard work is very commendable for us to learn from. Now that the country is in danger, we should not be pessimistic, as long as the people of the whole country can strive for success. I hope that you, the respectable and lovable young people, will take the spirit of the German people as an example, and one day you will be able to avenge yourselves and wipe out the humiliation."</p>
<p>▲ Summary of the Speech Continuing with Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department Tong Xingbai's speech, roughly stated, "China's position is declining day by day, entirely due to the declining national spirit of China. To save China, we must first save the Chinese national spirit. Boy Scouts are the most trained and organized citizens, with the habits of obeying discipline, following orders, and living in groups, and the virtues of automatically helping others and never slacking off. Therefore, if we want to save China, we must promote this Boy Scout training from schools to society." Finally, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan gave a speech, roughly stating that "Benevolence, wisdom, and courage, and benevolence is the center of Boy Scout training. The Prime Minister said that wisdom is knowing benevolence, and courage is practicing benevolence. The so-called benevolence is 'diligently practicing is close to benevolence.' Diligent practice has two meanings: on the one hand, using all strength to do it, and on the other hand, doing it with strong strength. This spirit can be seen in the Boy Scout area, because Boy Scouts have the spirit of obedience and mutual assistance. The Japanese say that China has no organization, and its problem lies in disobedience and lack of mutual assistance, so if you ask for benevolence, you can practice it by doing things with these two kinds of training."</p>
<p>▲ Performance Programs Finally, the Boy Scouts from each school performed. The programs included: (1) First aid (Shanghai High School), (2) Sign manipulation and hard work in games (Shanghai High School), (3) Exercises (Guangzhao), (4) Chinese martial arts and lion dance (Guangzhao), (5) Flag language (Fudan), (6) Human pyramid (Mullen), (7) Watchtower (Daxia), (8) Rescue (Daxia), (9) Pen stroke flag language and doing one good deed every day (Qingxin), (10) Camping competition (Minli), (11) Military stick stacking Luo Bin (Chengzhong), (12) Harmonica ensemble (Chengzhong), (13) Unpacking and packing (Jingye), (14) Stacking Luo Bin (Jingye), (15) Watchtower (Pudong). In particular, the watchtower of Daxia was the most exciting. The event ended at 6 p.m.</p>

Now that more time has passed, most of the districts have completed the re-election, but there are also a few districts that have been slow to hold it. In order to ensure that the re-election in each district is completed as soon as possible, so as to promote the association's affairs, we are hereby sending another notice, hoping that the districts that have already been re-elected will promptly report the re-election situation to this association in detail according to the previous notice. Those who have not yet been re-elected should convene a meeting of staff members as soon as possible to proceed with the re-election, and we hope that the staff members will assist the standing committee in jointly handling the matter. If the standing committee is not in Shanghai, or the staff members are scattered and cannot convene a staff meeting, resulting in a failure to prepare for the re-election, we also hope that the staff members in charge will inform this association in writing within one week, so that this association can send personnel to prepare for the re-election separately. This notice is hereby given, and we hope that you will take note and handle it accordingly."</p>

<p>▲New Jiangsu and Su Bao Agree to a Match</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Communication) Recently, various newspapers in Shanghai have organized football teams and competed with each other. It is a good story that scholars are galloping on the battlefield. The sports in the provincial capital have always been silent. The colleagues of New Jiangsu Newspaper and Su Bao are not willing to let the Shanghai newspapers monopolize the beauty. Each has also formed a team and agreed to a match. We are ashamed of the rabble, and when you come and go, there is actually the air of dragons and tigers. The sharp pen is transformed into a hard foot. The performance may not be sound and colorful. It must be solemn and harmonious. The lineups of both sides have been properly arranged.</p>

<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>Rural areas have always been accustomed to using national products, but recently, according to reports from various parties, enemy goods have been like mercury leaking on the ground,</p>
<p>Entering without a hole, taking advantage of its dumping policy, using the skills of unscrupulous merchants, they have actually penetrated into the interior and seized the sales of our national products. It is a pity that the recent rural areas have already been declining and dilapidated beyond description. Ordinary farming families have no savings, and their homes are bare, with no food to eat. They can no longer talk about any enjoyment, and they don't even have the purchasing power. The outlet for national products has already felt very difficult, so those who sell enemy goods take advantage of the opportunity of the farmers' poverty, and batch by batch of low-quality and cheap goods are transported to the interior to cater to their psychology and preferences, and the ignorant and powerless farmers willingly become the major customers of enemy goods. Thus, the enemy goods come in like a landslide, as if entering an uninhabited land, and the farmers who have run out of oil are squeezed again by those who sell enemy goods. Poor rural areas, poor farmers, holding a knife to others, bowing their heads and waiting to be cut. I wonder if those who talk about rural revitalization have thought about it? Have you ever seen it? In the stores in the interior that sell enemy goods, ask them why they willingly work for the</p>
<p>Tigers to harm the Chinese people. They all say that every family is like this. If he sells enemy goods and I don't sell enemy goods, watching others make money and losing money ourselves, who would be willing to do it? There is a person who specializes in department store business. He has several cotton cloth shops in the four townships of Shanghai. He said that after January 28th, only four or five months were doing clean public affairs, and there were no enemy goods at all. Later, those in our industry who were greedy for petty profits slowly sold enemy goods. One family sold, and every family sold. Now it has become an open secret. Anyway, no one is interfering, so just do it, smiling and laughing. These bastards cannot be killed enough, and they are all over the place. Shanghai is like this, and the interior is also like this. The ancients said that there is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart. Now the hearts are really like they are all dead. What else is there to talk about? Alas, it's a pity, it's a pity that this year's National Products Year is just a false name, only getting the newspapers excited and the advertisements dazzling. In fact, where is the National Products Year? It is simply the year when enemy goods are the most abundant. It can be said to be enemy goods. Ask the government, the government doesn't dare to ask. Ask the society, the social department is silent. In the past, those dazzling societies and organizations have left too good of a result. They have long been pointed at by thousands of people and died without a disease. Pity, pity, what kind of world is this? What kind of society is this? Only the rural areas have a small way in the absence of a way. That is, there must be a few foolish people in the local area who are willing to diligently implement import inspections and statistics. For example, how many cigarettes are imported in a month? How many pieces of cloth are imported? How many straw hats are imported? How many glasswares are imported? How many glass utensils are imported? How many undershirts and socks are imported? Create accurate statistics, and use the method of consumer cooperation to purchase directly from national products manufacturers in a centralized manner to distribute to the farmers in the whole village. And there must be a legitimate agency to prove it. In this way, if you do it strictly and fairly, I guarantee that enemy goods will not be able to escape. As long as the leaders in various places who are improving the rural areas are willing to make up their minds and spend a lot of effort to do it, there will definitely be good results. Compared with Shanghai and the metropolis, it feels easier to start. I hope comrades who are enthusiastic about the rural areas will try it out.</p>
<h3 id="e225">National Products Talk Promoting National Products and Relieving Rural Areas <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Xuanwan</p>
<p>"The biggest source of national products is the countryside, and the biggest outlet for national products is also the countryside." Mr. Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this publication, he has thoroughly told us these two sentences. Indeed, national products factories absorb a large amount of raw materials from the countryside, manufacture them into finished products, and then transport them to the countryside to supply their needs. The close relationship between the two, back and forth, should normally be in the same boat and cycle endlessly. However, since the recent deepening of the rural economic decline, the purchasing power is becoming weaker day by day. The serious situation has affected the sales of national products, adding a major obstacle to the future of developing the national products industry. We will not talk about other things for the time being. According to the recent reports from the Jiashu Six Counties National Products Mobile Exhibition and the Songjiang National Products Exhibition, the difference in results is unprecedented in the past exhibitions, which shows that the rural economy is extremely exhausted and accelerating its collapse. The facts are all there and obvious. Therefore, we have lost considerable effectiveness for the current situation of relying solely on the loud and hoarse promotion of mobile sales. There is an urgent need to remedy it with new methods, and we can also get a deep understanding from this. So what will be the trend of our national products factories in the future? How can we remove the thorns in the future and not hinder our scheduled progress? We clearly understand that the withering of the countryside is due to the expansion of the cities. Naturally, we can only assist the financial and industrial circles to try their best to help the countryside, return the production funds used by the countryside, so that they can work hard and increase production. Moreover, developing agriculture is also to reduce the original cost of the national products industry. The pulse is related and cannot be ignored. "Once the countryside gradually has vitality, commerce will naturally be able to revive, and sales can be drastically increased. This important plan to consolidate our own development future is naturally urgent. As for how to formulate a planned and organized plan, we hope that all national products pioneers will 'think long and look back' and conduct in-depth research and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Tidy Up Local Products <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Shanxiu</p>
<p>Modern so-called national products are disguised foreign goods,</p>
<p>Local products are authentic and genuine national products.</p>
<p>Let's take the smallest one as an example. Everyone</p>
<p>All know about smoking national products cigarettes, but try to see that the import value of cigarette raw materials | tobacco paper | in 1929 was 2,600,000 taels, and in 1931 it was 4,800,000 taels. This is such an astonishing number! Let's calculate it one by one. This sum of money can at least run hundreds of provincial middle schools now. Do you still need to talk about other aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation? Alas! Dear compatriots, wake up! To prevent profits from flowing out, the only way is to use local products. Using local products is our bounden duty, it is our self-help.</p>
<p>Do you all want to refute me? "If all Chinese people use</p>
<p>Use local products, then national products factories will inevitably close down, and tens of millions of workers will lose their jobs? Moreover, there are not enough local products to meet the demand now?" That's right, this is inevitable, but don't worry. Mr. Tai Shuangqiu, an educational doctor from Columbia University and a professor at Henan University, has already thought of a plan for us. We are not opposed to machine industry, nor are we going backwards. We do not want capital to be in the hands of a few people, and we do not want large factories in cities. We want to invest capital in the countryside, to buy machines and set up small factories in the countryside, so that everyone has a sideline and all have shares, and will not be slaves to a few people. We must really and practically tidy up the local products and supply our own needs. In this way, we can save the panic of rural economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Compatriots, remember it! Local products are authentic and genuine national products. Go to the countryside to tidy up local products!</p>

<h3 id="e228">Primary School National Products Movement <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>I remember that this publication previously published Mr. Guyuan's "University National Products Movement" article, which vividly and meticulously described the psychology and habits of college students who love to use foreign goods. It can be called an article that targets the bad habits and contributes to national products. However, according to my humble opinion, to rectify the end, we must first treat the root: primary school students are the root of college students, and every college student is made from primary school students; therefore, if we want to correct the wrong psychology and bad habits of college students, we should start with the primary school students in its root period. Therefore, I am not afraid of my shortcomings and imitate Handan, and create a primary school national products movement.</p>
<p>Primary school students who have just entered the school threshold are originally ignorant, without any knowledge to speak of, let alone love for the country. They only know to wear clothes when they have clothes, and use things when they have things. They are absolutely ignorant of the choice of materials. And most of the parents lack the ability to distinguish national products. As long as it is something that their children need, they will rashly purchase it. The source of the goods is not a concern: even knowing that it is a foreign product, or even an inferior product, because of the</p>
<p>Good looks and cheap prices, they will buy it regardless of everything: thus creating today's phenomenon of foreign goods flooding the primary school world. Try to set foot in various primary schools, and the students who use foreign goods are almost everywhere: even the pencils and foreign notebooks used, and the balls and billiard balls played with, are mostly imported products. But the general teachers are all blind, turning a blind eye; in fact, they are not unseen, mostly because the clothes they wear are also foreign goods. They have no patriotic concept themselves, so where can they have the mind to guide students? Therefore, the most chilling thing is that the school flag and uniforms, which are related to the overall appearance of the school, are made of foreign cloth; the school authorities have a disregard for national products in their hearts, so how can they expect their subordinates to reject foreign goods?</p>
<p>The number of primary schools in the country is difficult to count.</p>
<p>; And the number of primary school students in the country is especially as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. These salesmen of foreign goods, as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, have an impact on the future of revitalizing national products, which is no less than that of the more than 100,000 college students in the intellectual class; and the magnitude of their leakage is at least comparable to that of college student consumers, or even exceeds it. This kind of "accumulated mistakes into truth" does not know how to believe in national products</p>
<p>If we do not pay attention to this bad habit and change it, then as Mr. Guyuan said, "It will inevitably lead to all the financial resources of the country being sucked away by foreign merchants." When wealth is exhausted and the people are poor, the country can be expected to perish!</p>
<p>I believe that teachers are role models for students. All teachers in primary schools should set an example by themselves and have the necessity to actually use national products. For students, if foreign goods are found, they should not be afraid of trouble and repeatedly advise them to make them understand and not use them again. And they must always carefully explain the advantages and disadvantages of using national products and foreign goods, so as to cultivate their concept of respecting national products and despising foreign goods; so that they will not repeat the old mistakes of loving to use foreign goods when they go from primary school to middle school to university in the future. Once they step into society and take on the leadership of the masses, the results will naturally be remarkable.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this National Products Year, various places have expressed</p>
<p>Warm support. I think that the principals and teachers of primary schools across the country, who stand in the position of role models for the people, will definitely not lag behind in their patriotic enthusiasm. I sincerely hope that everyone will unite and promote it vigorously, persevere in their determination, and never slacken from beginning to end. The future of national products will be greatly blessed. Work hard! I am looking at it with my neck stretched out.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Industrial Raw Materials Industry Survey Investigation of China's Calcium Carbonate Manufacturing Industry (Part 1) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Songlu</p>
<p>Open a specialized book on the chemical industry, and the first chapter is about the chemical principles of calcium carbonate. Indeed, calcium carbonate occupies a very important position in chemical industrial raw materials, especially in the rubber industry, cosmetics, paper making, sugar refining, paints, and inks; these industries all use calcium carbonate as a primary raw material.</p>
<p>"Promote national goods, resist enemy goods!" This is a national slogan, but the most important condition for the manufacture of a national goods industry lies in the raw material issue. Otherwise, if foreign raw materials are used to manufacture domestic products, the profit rights will still inevitably flow out! What China feels most difficult now is the lack of raw materials. Take calcium carbonate as an example; it is pitiful to say that our country has only had a two-year history of setting up factories for self-production. Before 1931, it could be said that not a single calcium carbonate factory could be found in China! With this kind of so-called resistance to foreign goods, how effective can you expect it to be?</p>
<p>In 1931, Chinese people, recognizing the development of the rubber industry and the lack of domestic raw materials, and also because of the Wanbaoshan Incident, the call to resist Japanese goods was very high. Therefore, people with lofty ideals rose up to plan to establish factories for self-manufacturing. In this year, three calcium carbonate factories were established in Shanghai at the same time: Zhaoxin Chemical Factory, Dachunghua Calcium Factory, and Xinye Chemical Factory. With the simultaneous rise of these three calcium factories in China, the raw material problem of calcium carbonate was fundamentally resolved in our country's industrial manufacturing. Indeed! This is the best record in the industrial history of our country! It is worth introducing to our national goods industrial and commercial circles. Therefore, I will briefly introduce the latest survey of these three calcium factories:</p>
<p>(1) Zhaoxin Chemical Factory: Zhaoxin Factory is located in Chenjiadu, West Shanghai, with a capital of 250,000 yuan. Manager Mr. Li Zuyi graduated from the Mechanical Engineering Department of the University of Hannover in Germany and obtained a master's degree. He is one of the leading talents in mechanical engineering in China. Mr. Li has very detailed experience in mechanical research, so all the machinery in the factory is designed and assembled by Mr. Li himself, and all domestic components are used. This is the most commendable thing about establishing a national goods factory. Chairman Mr. Fang Yexian is one of the most enthusiastic people in the national goods industry. The businesses he runs include China Chemical Industry Company, Jingming Glass Factory, Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Company, and China National Goods Company. Part of the products of the Zhaoxin Factory is supplied to the China Chemical Industry Company as raw materials for manufacturing cosmetics. The factory also has a managing director, Mr. Guo Yongkang, who has also made great contributions to the national goods industry. He has conducted long-term investigations in Japan and has a detailed understanding of the chemical industry in Japan. He has personally investigated the national goods industry in the British, American, and French territories of the South Seas, so he is very familiar with the industrial and commercial situation in the world. The Zupai brand calcium carbonate produced by the factory is manufactured in imitation of the German style and supplemented by the Japanese style. The current daily output is 167 bags (each weighing 100 pounds), with a total weight of 16,700 pounds. In addition to supplying a part of its products to the China Chemical Industry Company for manufacturing cosmetics, the majority is sold to rubber factories all over the country. According to the test results of many chemical experts, the Zhaoxin Factory's products should be recognized as having the lightest quality among domestically produced calcium carbonate (the lighter and purer the calcium carbonate component). The general manager's office for the factory's products is located at Ligong Industrial Raw Materials Company, No. 2500, Henan Road.</p>

<p>Visit Report</p>
<h3 id="e230">A Visit to the Kang Yuan Factory <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>I had already recognized the outline of the Kang Yuan Factory in many publications before, and this visit was indeed well-prepared. Although still within the scope of Shanghai, it took quite a while to travel from West Shanghai to East Shanghai. Sitting quietly in the car, I was in a hunting-like contemplation, ready to find some new materials.</p>
<p>This is a miracle! After explaining my intention, I was granted permission. Interestingly, I asked in a roundabout way:</p>
<p>"Could you give me an opportunity today?"</p>
<p>I was not rejected because there was no prior appointment. Mr. Xiang Kangyuan replied straightforwardly:</p>
<p>"Sure, we don't need any preparation!"</p>
<p>Led by two staff members of the factory, I walked through the entire Kang Yuan Factory, including the dormitory, workshop, and sports ground. There were explanations everywhere, especially when I saw the factory motto, that gentleman would explain it eloquently.</p>
<p>The factory roughly includes several parts, from drawing, stone setting, printing, polishing, can making, to packing, like a cycle, going through several procedures in an orderly manner from here to there. There is also a chemical testing department, which is a place dedicated to testing inks. It was working during the visit, but there were only the sounds of machines and iron sheets falling.</p>
<p>Of course, an outsider cannot arbitrarily judge the actual work, but the cleanliness and order of the workshop gave me a very satisfactory impression.</p>
<p>The dormitory is very clean, with bedding of the same color, like the military and schools (in fact, the military and schools in China are not yet like this!). If I hadn't seen it in the Kang Yuan Factory, no one would dare to say it was a workers' dormitory, because the plight of Chinese workers' lives is already an undeniable fact!</p>
<p>The clothes in the storage cabinet are neatly arranged. Although they are all coarse cloth clothes, there are no oil stains or mess. The power of Kang Yuan workers' autonomy can also be proved to exceed the general standard here.</p>
<p>The slogans, creeds, and classrooms of the education department are all like schools. The leading gentleman introduced them one by one, and he could talk about those things like flowing water. It is a pity that it was not during class time, otherwise I would have had to visit the actual factory schooling.</p>
<p>The dining hall is on the second floor, run by the factory itself. In terms of hygiene and worker treatment, this is indeed a great improvement. The sports ground, hospital, and staff residences are all in the factory. According to the Kang Yuan Factory's overview, there are also organizations such as the volunteer army, Boy Scouts, and national martial arts team, and fire protection is also well-known. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to visit those actual worker activities.</p>
<p>This is an idealized factory! Everything is familial and school-like. Although it cannot be said that it can completely solve the suffering of workers, many tasteless troubles have been reduced a lot. However, this is by no means a waste. The excellent quality, honor, and harvest of Kang Yuan products are also sufficient as a reward.</p>
<p>During my visit, there was someone, probably studying labor issues, also visiting there. They raised some questions about the workers, and they all received satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>On a spring afternoon, I walked out of the Kang Yuan Factory alone. Coincidentally, a group of foreign soldiers was conducting field exercises in the open space. Many Chinese people thought it was lively and watched from the sidelines with smiles, without any expression of pain. This really added to my feelings.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Inland Townships and National Goods <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chenghun</p>
<p>For several weeks, the National Goods Mobile Sales Team has been working hard in many cities, towns, and villages. According to their latest report, two points deserve our urgent attention: one is that the townships around Shanghai are still filled with foreign goods; the second is that the team's banner is everywhere, and the whole town is emptied, and the retail of goods is in short supply.</p>
<p>The first point is the most serious, because in rural gatherings, inland townships with underdeveloped intelligence, letting these foreign goods, enemy goods, flow continuously, makes it impossible for the basic people to see national goods forever. How dangerous and urgently in need of treatment is this? The reason why inland shops have to sell foreign goods and enemy goods is said to be that they also have one-sided difficulties. Because foreign goods have high profits, they have to take care of the lifeline of the shop foundation and the lives of their partners, so they can only quench their thirst with poison and do so. There is absolutely no possibility of selling national goods with extremely low profits. In addition, customers are greedy for cheap prices and love fancy things, and have no time to consider national goods or non-national goods. Therefore, the root of the disease is deeply rooted and it is difficult to change.</p>
<p>If we also use the Shanghai method of issuing warnings and throwing bombs to prohibit unscrupulous merchants from selling foreign goods to inland shops, I dare to assert that the effect will be equally low. The fundamental lies in how national goods factories should diligently reduce costs and lower prices, and how to improve products and strive for favor. Otherwise, squeezing in Shanghai to loudly promote national goods and persuade people to use national goods, while inland is still full of foreign goods, spreading to the countryside, I ask, what is the actual benefit?</p>
<p>The second point seems to be slightly comforting. In fact, the people in the townships are not absolutely fond of foreign goods and enemy goods. Basically, they have not recognized national goods. At the same time, the sale of foreign goods and enemy goods by shops has also covered a layer of curtains between the people and national goods. The national goods exhibitions in major cities in the past lack sincere and universal publicity work, and cannot receive the effect of going deep into the people. All national goods traveling groups with simple organization and short economic means also rush through the market in a hasty manner, leaving no deep impression. I think the National Goods Mobile Sales Team, which is currently working hard, may be able to produce some results.</p>
<p>Because the National Goods Mobile Sales Team has a close relationship with various national goods manufacturers, and the organization and mission are relatively advanced. I think it not only has the task of raising the awareness of national goods among the inland people, but also should use effective methods to assist and guide the inland shops in operating national goods, and eliminate foreign goods in the shortest term!</p>
<p>I am very ashamed to offer the above two points of view to the gentlemen of various national goods factories and the National Goods Mobile Sales Team.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Thus Have I Heard - On Selling Japanese Goods <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Ziqiang</p>
<p>The violent sun is approaching, and gods and men are indignant. Pledging to die together, the whole country is in a frenzy. Therefore, economic severance and resistance to Japanese goods have become the most important work at present. However, unscrupulous merchants and market monks sell as usual. The so-called Japanese goods are colorful and fill the market. It is difficult to distinguish between their authenticity and falsehood.</p>
<p>Not only that, but they also establish brand names and cleverly change trademarks, confusing the eye, making it impossible to identify. It is a pity that Yu Ding and Wen Xi cannot discern their treachery. These running dogs of Japan, acting as accomplices for the tiger, are guilty of death, and everyone should eat their flesh.</p>
<p>However, I heard the words of the unscrupulous merchants (not officially heard, but rumored): "Oriental goods are deeply rooted in the psychology of ordinary people. Although they want to resist, they cannot. Because many people use them, if there is no way to respond to them, they will look to others. Even if we can resist here, how can we ensure that the other side will not proceed as usual?"</p>
<p>Alas! Although the fault lies with the unscrupulous merchants, the ordinary drunken and dream-like people must also bear the blame. I think this responsibility should be entrusted to those who are responsible for the local area, and propaganda should be carried out at any time to explain the great righteousness, so that those unscrupulous merchants cannot gain their profits, so that the future of national goods will not be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>I often daydream like this, if the sea ban had not been lifted at that time, would our Chinese people still not have made progress by now? Also, if the sea ban had not been lifted at that time, our Chinese people would certainly still be living generation after generation. They would not die as soon as they were born. Looking at Chinese history, it is progressing generation after generation, and there is no fact of one generation regressing after another. In the past, China's prestige really shocked the world. Who knew that now, whether in diplomacy or commerce, there is nothing that is not restricted by foreigners, trampled by foreigners, and unable to break free. I think this problem comes from the opening of the sea ban. Since the opening of the sea ban, goods from various countries have come one after another, creating the Chinese people's habit of using foreign goods, which has become more and more serious until now. Even wearing a suit is not beautiful, living in a foreign house is not comfortable, eating big dishes is not satisfying, and traveling by car is not happy... (This is talking about the rich, and ordinary people certainly cannot do it; but a small amount of foreign goods promotion is inevitable.) If the sea ban had not been lifted, they would not abandon Chinese silk or cloth clothes, abandon Chinese-style gorgeous residences, move away from the delicacies of the mountains and seas, and stop riding in cars and palanquins.</p>
<p>"Humans are curious animals!" This is true. Because of their curiosity, they will always like the new and dislike the old. Only by liking the new and disliking the old can they abandon the essence of national goods and use the dross of foreign goods. I can't understand this reason at all.</p>
<p>"Is it good to open the sea ban, or is it good not to open it?"</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In Shanghai, some people call foreign goods "goods from the road." What a good term "goods from the road"! How much praise it gets! The trendsetter, if he wears a foreign-made dress, he must like to boast in front of his friends, "This is a genuine 'goods from the road'!" His friends will definitely echo, "That's great, how much does each foot of this kind of 'goods from the road' cost?" Now the times have changed slightly. If you really wear a foreign-made dress, because the country is in trouble, you don't want to say, "This is 'goods from the road'," you want to say, "Look, how good are national goods!" I think: wearing foreign goods on the body and saying about wearing foreign goods in the mouth is an unforgivable sin. If you wear foreign goods and say you are wearing Chinese goods, I think the sin should be aggravated by one level. This is not only ruining national goods, but also related to your own personality.</p>
<p>There are also some women who do not understand the times. Of course, they do not know whether they are Western or Eastern goods. They only know that foreign goods are always fashionable and new. They make them to wear on their bodies and say to their companions, "This is 'goods from the road'." The women who say this sentence are probably parasites who are not responsible for making a living. Their consumption power is very considerable, but they all consume on foreigners and have to vigorously promote it to foreigners. This is really foolish. Those who have the responsibility of husbands can advise them!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>I heard a friend who is familiar with the cotton cloth business say to me sincerely, "Now the general unscrupulous merchants are really confused and are selling Oriental goods there at a loss!" I heard it and seemed a little unbelievable. This is an ancient Chinese proverb: "Do thousands of things, do not do things at a loss." Could it be that they are selling Oriental goods there at a loss? This seems a little incomprehensible. After careful investigation, it turned out to be true. Because those unscrupulous merchants only seek their own interests and do not care about the interests of others. They put forward one or two kinds of inferior goods, mark them cheaply, and attract customers. In this way, the general blind public only knows that the goods are cheap, so how can they think that these are inferior goods! As for them, they use inferior goods to seduce buyers, which can also involve other goods and reap their benefits. The danger of their intentions is like snakes and scorpions! Although there are ×× groups that still resolutely warn, it is also of no avail. I think this "serving national goods" purpose should be embraced by oneself, that is reliable. If you want others to urge and warn you, the best result can only be effective now, not forever! Having said that, to serve national goods, relying solely on propaganda seems to be of no avail. The first thing is to transform people's hearts; transforming people's hearts is such a difficult thing!</p>

<h3 id="e234">National Goods Rice Milling Machine <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The Danxin brand rice milling machine produced by Ding Yongyi Factory in Jinhui Bridge, Fengxian, can be said to be perfect and without any regrets. Ding Yongyi Factory was originally a rice sieve factory specializing in manufacturing rice machine sieves, and its business was very prosperous. The owner, Mr. Ding Shiru, likes to study mechanical science. Five years ago, he saw a rice milling machine produced in Japan somewhere. He studied it carefully, drew it into a picture, and hired workers to imitate it after returning. On the day the machine was completed, the test was good! The villagers competed to buy and use it. Over the past five years, it has been repeatedly improved and has become more perfect!</p>
<p>The structure of this machine is not very complicated, and the only raw materials required are wood and iron. Wood is used to make the machine body, which is naturally sourced from domestic production. That is, other accessories such as "iron nails," "iron teeth," and "iron wheels," except for "iron nails," which are purchased from domestic screws from hardware stores at sea, the rest are all manufactured by themselves through sand casting. Therefore, it can be called a purely domestic rice milling machine! In addition, as a result of years of improvement, the machine body has been slightly widened so that three or four people can work at the same time. The "iron teeth" on the machine shaft have also been increased compared to before, in order to increase its working efficiency. Even the wheel teeth at the junction of the large and small pulleys have been greatly changed to make it easier to rotate and increase the speed. Therefore, the work of three people and one machine can mill about ten acres of rice a day; compared with the previous rice mill, it is more than three times higher! With such a good domestic new agricultural tool! Isn't it worth introducing it?</p>

<p>▲A Shanghai merchant realized that my country's confectionery industry has huge financial losses every year. He wanted to recover profit rights and meet social needs. Therefore, he founded the Xianghai Machine Confectionery Factory on the other side of the Outer Hongqiao. He purchased various new-style machines and imitated large confectionery factories abroad. He specializes in making high-end candies of various styles, using the "Fanle Brand" as a trademark. The factory's output is very rich and can resist foreign goods. It is the crown of my country's confectionery industry. In addition, various Fanle flavored candies, toffee, cream candies, and fresh fruit candies are all carefully made by German master technicians. The materials are pure and clean. It is unparalleled. It is more than comparable to imported products. It is heard that sales have spread throughout the country and still need to be gradually expanded. Starting this year, all products will be entrusted to the local Huada Bank for management. The bank has been in business for many years and has an excellent reputation. The promotion of well-known national goods candies can be said to complement each other. The future development is almost limitless. It is truly an important news in the year of national goods.</p>
<p>▲Guangshengxiang Sock Factory, located at the intersection of Shangmei Sanma Road and Henan Road, produces steamship brand silk stockings, ramie stockings, and cotton stockings, which have always been the leading industry in the silk industry and have been praised by all sectors of society. However, the factory has always had a desire to improve and has worked hard to research, in order to live up to the expectations of all sectors of society. Recently, it has newly invented a Huasha sock, a seasonal style for summer. Both men's and women's styles are available. The sock body is very glossy and smooth, which is extraordinary. All those who have tried it have praised it in unison, and the industry has been amazed by it. It is truly a highlight in the national goods sock industry.</p>

<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Now in the 20th century, men and women pay attention to equality. Since men can serve in society, naturally, women must also work in the professional industry. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>However, we know that since the beginning of the world, men have not earned any nicknames or honorary titles for serving in society. However, female clerks sitting in the writing room are now called "vases" by men. Is this insulting them, or is it talking about equality?</p>
<p>However, after careful study, the reason why female clerks are seen as "vases" by men is really because "Jesus has his own reasons." In other words, it is that they are "self-inflicted" and can't blame anyone.</p>
<p>Because the colorful clothes they wear are all "imported goods!" The rouge and perfume they apply on their faces are nothing but "foreign goods!" Imagine, dressed up like this, sitting in the writing room, looking like a foreign goods salesman! So, who will respect her? Since they cannot get respect, naturally, they will be insulted and casually regarded as "vases" by men.</p>
<p>Alas! "Vase," how can a good woman be called a "vase" by others? Naturally, this is indeed an insult, and a major insult! Sisters in the professional industry! Do you want to overthrow this insulting title? If you want to overthrow this insulting title, I have a great plan that I am willing to contribute to you. This great plan is to advise you to change all the clothes you wear on your body and the things you apply on your face to "national goods." Because if you use "national goods," everyone will only admire you. Even if you can dress up as "beautifully," however, with the dignity of "national goods," who would dare to insult you and call you a "vase"?</p>
<p>Yiyi Guan Zhu notes: Men who use "foreign goods" should also be given honorary titles to be fair.</p>
<p>However, it is quite difficult to think of this honorary title for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Qiaoqi's Ball <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Qiaoqi was very happy in his heart when he went to school today, because yesterday his father had bought him a pink little ball, which could bounce three feet high with one pat, which was really a very fun thing.</p>
<p>"Huisheng, look, how good is this ball!" As soon as he entered the school gate, Qiaoqi couldn't wait to present his little ball to his friend Huisheng, who was also seven years old. But Huisheng looked at it and seemed not to pay any attention. Qiaoqi felt very puzzled. Later, Huisheng also held a ball.</p>
<p>"Look at mine, isn't it much bigger than yours?" Huisheng's ball was indeed several times larger than Qiaoqi's ball, and there were stripes on it, and the color was yellow. Many children looked at it and said that Huisheng's ball was good, and Qiaoqi's ball was not good.</p>
<p>Qiaoqi hid the ball in a fit of anger. When he went back for lunch, he was anxious to start negotiations with his father, and also told the style and color of Huisheng's ball, asking his father to buy the same one back.</p>
<p>"Ah! Child, that is an Oriental product! The hawkers on the road don't know the details, so they sell it there randomly, but we must not buy it: your ball is small, but it is always Chinese national goods, which is much better than their Oriental goods!" Father explained this way.</p>
<p>After listening, Qiaoqi still happily hugged his little ball to school. When he saw Huisheng, he smiled at him:</p>
<p>"What you bought is an Oriental product, are you embarrassed?" Huisheng certainly refused to admit that it was an Oriental product. The two children argued, and the classmates did not know who was right and who was wrong. Later, the teacher came and took a look at Huisheng's ball. It was indeed an Oriental product, so he told everyone. Huisheng couldn't help crying in embarrassment.</p>
<p>A day later, Huisheng also taught his father to buy a national goods little ball like Qiaoqi's, and the teacher praised him.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Divine Will <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Chinese people have always revered Heaven, so they place great importance on 'Divine Will.'</p>
<p>Now that 'human affairs' have deteriorated beyond repair, all expressions of sorrow, grief, and resentment seem largely unnecessary. Because everything about China, whether present or future, has long been predestined by Heaven, and cannot be salvaged by human effort. Helpless as we are, if our hearts are truly bursting with pain, we should shout 'Heaven' a few more times. 'People' are unreliable, especially since no one even pays attention to you! Since the September 18th Incident, China has constantly relied on the League of Nations. If the Western powers had sufficient strength, they might have come to the Far East and, disregarding appearances, spoken a word of justice. But they are too busy looking after themselves; how could they have time for your Chinese affairs? Therefore, Japan disregards everything and boldly advances into the Great Wall, North China, and even... Since China has no one to turn to for help, naturally it can only retreat helplessly. Is this not the will of Heaven?</p>
<p>The League of Nations cannot help China; if China could have used all its strength to resist Japan, perhaps it would not have deteriorated to this state. But instead, everything is chaotic and confusing. 'Internal pacification' is considered more urgent, so where is there spare strength to discuss 'external resistance'? Is this not the will of Heaven?</p>
<p>Although the Red bandits are bound to restrain 'external resistance,' if the Southwest authorities could take responsibility for 'internal pacification,' the Central government's three or four hundred thousand troops could certainly be used for 'external resistance.' But the Southwest remains in a state of wait-and-see, and has never sent troops. Is this not the will of Heaven?</p>
<p>These are just the major examples. Besides these, there are many minor signs, such as the floods and droughts of recent years, the rebellions in Xinjiang and Tibet, the internal strife in Shandong, Sichuan, and Guizhou, the wavering attitude of the southwestern provinces, and, down to the rampant activities of traitorous merchants, all happening together, without delay, during the most serious times of national crisis. The court and the people are bewildered and do not know what to do. Since the beginning of mankind, there has never been such chaos! Is this not the will of Heaven?</p>
<p>I have always been optimistic about the domestic situation. But seeing so many manifestations of the will of Heaven, I cannot help but utter a sigh of 'Alas.' This sigh contains the hidden pain of having to save, wanting to save but being unable to, watching death without being able to save, and having no way to save. But once I think of this as the will of Heaven, I have no choice but to give up!</p>
<p>Alas, the rise and fall, the survival and destruction of a nation, though attributed to human affairs, are not, in truth, ordained by Heaven!</p>
<h3 id="e239">Tears <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Chuyou</p>
<p>Women are the most prone to tears; using summer rain as a symbol of women's tears is quite appropriate.</p>
<p>In summer, as long as the weather is somewhat hot and stuffy, or after a few strong gusts of wind, these subtle little reasons can cause it to rain in the summer; although it doesn't last long, what's called a 'passing shower' that stops in a few minutes, the rain falls as fiercely as a waterfall, and the raindrops are as thick as bamboo sticks, which can be a little frightening when encountered. Women's tears are like summer rain; as long as their hearts are a little unhappy, they experience some external stimuli, or their bodies have a minor ailment, their tears will flow wildly like summer rain. To vent the sorrow hidden in their hearts and the pain in their bodies, these wildly flowing tears are the only method for women!</p>
<p>As for the tears of us men, they are like winter rain, reluctant to fall easily. Although sometimes a few heroic tears may be shed, it's not that men don't have inner sorrow or physical pain; it's just that men are more able to endure than women, more able to put things behind them. Even if it is really unbearable for a moment, and they can't put it behind them, often, at the height of grief, they cannot even shed tears because most of their tears have already turned into blood and strength, and the few remaining tears are swallowed instead of flowing outward!</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Nation of Words <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>Our China is the great nation of words; this cannot be denied.</p>
<p>When young people fall in love, when men and women become friends, they always start by saying to each other: let's form an alliance of scholarly pursuits. In fact, if the spirit of love were entrusted to words, then, even if it's not nauseating, I think we could achieve mutual understanding on various thoughts, which wouldn't be bad. But reality is reality, and after the mask of love is removed, they will go step by step to do some things that young people do, and the result is that the woman hires a lawyer to accuse the man of 'seduction,' 'breach of contract,' and what is called 'starting with intimacy and ending with abandonment.' The lawyer's indictment is written with ten thousand flowery words, and the newspaper's account is written with flowery language, making people feel nauseated and infatuated. If we carefully try to understand, then we can discover that this game of love is fundamentally dominated by words, beginning with an exchange of words and ending with a resolution in words.</p>
<p>When warlords want a civil war, they must first issue a grand and extensive telegram. When the government wants non-resistance, it also declares how long it will resist. In essence, it's just officialdom in writing.</p>
<p>Only we comrades who engage in textual labor are often harmed by careless writing. If a word is used in a frightening way, it is the XX party. Looking at the several literary inquisitions of the early Qing Dynasty, one can know that scholars cannot misuse words, and this is even more intense today.</p>
<p>In short, words also have a hierarchy. The superiors can say whatever they want to the inferiors, but the inferiors must be cautious when speaking to the superiors.</p>
<h3 id="e241">The Skill of Words <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Fen Hua</p>
<p>The Sichuan warlords have launched another war, and the Anti-Civil War League of this city</p>
<p>has telegraphed both sides, requesting them to prioritize the national crisis and cease fighting against external enemies.</p>
<p>They were quite receptive, and Deng Xihou sent a reply. The wording of the reply was really good, using the ability of literary skill to the fullest.</p>
<p>He said: 'I have always admired your esteemed association's concern for the national crisis and efforts to stop internal strife. I, Xihou, have always loved peace and been ashamed of internal wars. Now, the more I retreat, the more Liu Wenhui advances, making it extremely difficult for the entire army to retreat. At this time of national crisis, he disregards everything! You, esteemed gentlemen, are the lucky stars of peace, calling out in all directions. I urge you to quickly propose effective sanctions against those who provoke war without cause, to uphold justice.' It turns out that he greatly admires the esteemed association which is concerned with the national crisis, and he greatly loves peace, and is ashamed of internal wars, but because the other side is advancing, the whole army is extremely angry and difficult to restrain, so he is not responsible. Not only is he not responsible, but he is also placing the responsibility on the esteemed gentlemen of the association, demanding effective sanctions to uphold justice. If the esteemed association does not have effective sanctions, then it has nothing to do with him, and it is the fault of the esteemed association for not fulfilling its duty, and the esteemed association should no longer ask him to cease fighting. It's really wonderful, and we'll have to see how Liu Wenhui replies. I imagine that Liu also understands the skill of words, and perhaps Liu's wording is even better than Deng's, because this is already a masterpiece of the Sichuan warlords. In short, one way or another, they won't be wrong, and the mistake really lies in the fact that China has that blessed land, the land of Sichuan, where they can close the door and put on a show!</p>
<h3 id="e242">Modernity Knows No National Crisis <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Wohfo</p>
<p>'National crisis' is certainly not something personal, or belonging to a few people. All the people of China, and everything Chinese, are being suppressed by this impending national crisis. 'Saving the nation' is a cry that has been squeezed out by this impending national crisis! But there are exceptions to everything. 'Modernity' in China knows no national crisis. National crisis will not befall 'modernity.' Modernity knows no national crisis, so there is fundamentally no need to save the nation.</p>
<p>The modern dance halls, the modern cinemas, the modern cafes, and the companies that sell modernity, the agencies that promote modernity, and the places that flaunt modernity. Whether you have the eyes of a thousand miles or the ears of the wind, you won't find any trace of national crisis in this area. Even the omnipresent and ever-penetrating national crisis, upon reaching these modern locales, can only sigh in despair and retreat in hesitation. Moreover, there is an ironclad piece of evidence:</p>
<p>The special correspondent of Shen Bao, Geng Ya, said in 'Notes from the War Zone': ': Returning to the adjutant's office, I saw the orderly packing his luggage. Surprised, I asked him why. I learned that the military headquarters was about to move to a certain place. The reporter hurriedly left the city. The moonlight was desolate, and I felt gloomy! At that time, there were petite and exquisite modern women walking together along the sandy road, accompanied by soldiers carrying suitcases and luggage. I guessed that they were the dependents of officials, but I dared not be sure.' Isn't this account a good illustration of 'modernity knows no national crisis'? Let's not worry about whether she is the official's dependent. But modernity is still modernity. So, even though the impending national crisis is progressing rapidly, how can it catch up with the particularly fast running of modernity's two fleshy legs? Tell me, is there any hope for the national crisis to catch up with modernity? As for those who are not modern? Because they are not modern, they can only let the national crisis strike head-on, let the national crisis encircle us heavily, what else can they say?</p>

<p>Chapter Seven: A Few Words Sever Affection, Closing the Door to Weep in Pain, Bearing the Burden of Righteousness on One Shoulder, Discussing Business with Wine</p>
<p>When Xiao Lin saw the company commander at home, he was extraordinarily diligent. He had already brought several plates of cold dishes to the table. Zhao Ziqiang, holding the kettle, first poured a cup into the cup at the head of the table, and said, "Brother Guan, please sit." With this, everyone had no choice but to stop talking and sit down to drink. The Zhao father and son sat in the main seat first, so everyone else had to sit down. Old Man Zhao raised his chopsticks and pointed at the cold dishes, saying, "Please, please, I didn't prepare any good dishes, just a gathering for everyone to have fun. If you are all happy, you might as well throw a few punches." Zhao Ziqiang smiled slightly at Old Man Zhao and said, "You want to get drunk again, why bother? These few days, I've always been unhappy. I heard that Jinzhou was lost, not a single bullet was fired, and another large area of land was lost. When I go outside, I always hear people say, 'You Northeastern soldiers, carrying your guns, are always turning around and running away.' I'm so angry that I want to die. I'm not a division commander, and I'm not a brigade commander, what can I do? If I were at least a regimental commander, I would lead a regiment of men to confront the Japanese. Even if you say I'm disobeying military orders, at most you'll just take me out and shoot me, what's the big deal?" Yin Deren raised his wine glass, drained it in one gulp, put down the wine glass, pressed it with his hand, showing his very calm appearance, and looked at Zhao Ziqiang and said, "You are right. I'm not afraid of anything. Whatever I do, I just want to do it happily. The sea is wide and the sky is vast, I am a grown man. Whatever I want to do, I dare to let go and do it. You're not like me, you still have an old man." Hearing these words, Zhao Ziqiang glanced at Old Man Zhao and dared not say anything more. Old Man Zhao held the cup in his right hand, twisted a few long whiskers in his left hand, and smiled slightly, saying, "You don't think I'm lying when I say this, I'll tell you. Sending my son to be a soldier is entrusting my son to the nation. To tell you the truth, since I was a child, I liked to watch drum lyrics, but I didn't like the brother and sister stuff, what with the Biography of Jingzhong, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Seven Swordsmen and Five Righteous Men, those were my favorites, I always wanted Ziqiang to do something earth-shattering, I don't worry about anything else."

<p>— Xinong</p>
<p>We all have this experience, right? Women are particularly skilled at casual conversation. As long as they find a match (they'll find one very easily, and those matches are, of course, mostly women), they'll go on and on and on, talking and talking, starting with the cat of the family to the east and going all the way to the dog of the family to the west. Even if they talk for two or three hours straight, they don't get tired at all. Moreover, it seems this is the case in both ancient times and in foreign countries. It's not just women in our China who are like this. Why do women like to talk so much? According to research by two German physiologists, women's vocal cords are lighter than men's, so they vibrate more easily and produce sound waves. That's an interesting discovery.</p>
<p>We all know the functions of the skin: it protects muscles and organs, and it also carries out respiration and excretion. But according to recent research, it also contains a bactericidal substance. So, in addition to the above-mentioned effects, it also has the direct function of preventing infectious diseases from entering. According to experiments, if we put bacteria such as typhoid bacteria on the skin, it will destroy 90% to 95% of all the bacteria in an instant. However, this function is directly proportional to the cleanliness of the skin. If it is too dirty, it will completely lose its effect.</p>
<p>We can usually observe that the feathers of birds and animals, even without being lubricated with any grease or water, are neat and smooth. Unlike human hair, it takes time, money, and patience to obtain temporary neatness and beauty after a procedure. They are both hair, why are humans given so little of it? According to recent research by the German scientist Exner, there is also the effect of electricity in between. For example, in birds, the feathers are arranged very densely. Because of their mutual friction, electricity is generated. Fine feathers are the cathode, and feathers are the anode. Although there is no distinction between fine and coarse hair in animals, there is also a difference in thickness. Coarse hair is like bird feathers, bearing positive electricity, and fine hair bears negative electricity. According to the principle of opposites attracting each other, they appear neat and smooth. But at the same time, because of the repulsion of opposite charges between the fine hairs, the fine hairs are evenly spread over the body. Therefore, this electrical effect has two meanings for birds and animals. One is that the fluffiness of the fine hair prevents body heat from dissipating, and the other is that the smoothness of the feathers makes it difficult for rainwater and other harmful substances to enter. Human hair is completely one color, with no distinction between thick and thin, so the result of friction can only produce electrodes of the same charge, which repel each other. This is also why hair is not easy to comb straight when it is dry. When it is wetted with water, and the electricity is conducted away, it is easy to comb neatly. The growth of children is generally thought by people to be directly proportional to time and nutrition. But according to recent research published by Professor Lang Kai of Harvard University, the facts are surprisingly different. The growth of children is not only related to good nutrition but is also greatly influenced by the seasons. Lang has made two measurements of body length and weight on healthy children in nurseries, and the results show that the increase in weight can be divided into three periods according to its speed of increase: for two-year-old children, the fastest is between September and December, the slowest is between May and August, and January to April is relatively average. The larger children (from three to six years old) grow fastest between June and November, followed by May, and slowest between December and April. At the same time, the increase in body length can be divided into four periods, the fastest from April to July, followed by September to November, followed by August, and slowest from December to March. Moreover, whether large or small children, the results are exactly the same, not only divided into four periods, but the order of fast and slow is also the same.</p>
<p>The abominableness and harm of mosquitoes can be said to be known to everyone, so there is no need to say more. But the effective methods to drive them away that humans know so far are very few. Dr. Gelefu of Germany, in order to find a more effective defense method, has done many experiments in the tropics. He made seventeen boxes of different colors, placed mosquito-attracting items inside, and placed them where mosquitoes gathered. As a result, most of the mosquitoes gathered in the dark blue boxes. Scarlet, dark gray, and dark colors had very few. White, purple, green, and other colors had even fewer. And there were no mosquitoes at all in the yellow boxes. The experiments were all the same. From this we know that mosquitoes do not like the color yellow, or they do not have a yellow sense. We can use this to protect against mosquitoes, such as changing window curtains, tents, and lights to yellow for a try.</p>

<p>Fluctuations in the financial gold market cause a drop of six yuan</p>
<p>The United States is about to implement a preliminary currency inflation plan</p>
<p>The gold market rose and then fell yesterday, and the situation is still fluctuating. In the early morning, due to the rise in silver on the overseas silver market and the stability in the United States, the exchange rate continued to rise. The forward silver price on the Precious Metals Exchange fell slightly. Both US cotton and stocks rose, so the gross price was slightly lower. After the market opened, the exchange rate rose sharply, and HSBC's listed British exchange rate shrank by 125, and the US exchange rate remained stable. After the announcement, the exchange rate turned loose, and the gold price also fell back. The gold industry tried hard to block the US exchange rate, and the situation became strong, and the internal market loosened, and the drop began. Finally, the banks took advantage of the cheap prices to accept them, and they were still able to recover. As a result, it fell more. There was an oversupply in the market, people's hearts were uncertain, and the big players were not yet united. In summary, the main sales and the Guangbang sales were stronger. The Dalian gang Wanxing was keen to buy shares. There were no special changes during the half day. Only the Reuters report in the gross price stated that the US government has bought 25 million bonds and plans to collect 300 million in total, implementing the first step of the currency inflation plan. However, people's hearts were more tired. Although the issue price has been discussed many times, it is difficult to obtain results. The economists' meeting yesterday afternoon also failed to reach a decision. It will be decided by the board of directors after reference next time. The price of cooking is calculated to increase by 60 yuan. The market situation for half a day is recorded below: The morning opening was 971 yuan and 80 cents, which was 2 yuan lower than the previous close. The goods opened at the same price. The exchange rate opened relatively flat. The recent selling price was calculated at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 9375 for the British exchange rate, and 24 yuan and 25 cents for the US exchange rate. Yifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang reached 2 yuan and 80 cents. Mitsui came out with half a yuan for the US dollar in July. Hengxing rushed to sell on the market, and it fell to 1 yuan and 20 cents. Although Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang came out, the trend was stable because Dade Cheng Yifeng Fuchang Daxing Yong came to buy. The bank vigorously pulled the US dollar in September at 875 multiple times, and it was 5 yuan. Before long, the exchange rate tightened, and the US dollar in July was half a yuan. Daxing Yongfuyu Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang and others vigorously bought, and it reached 7 yuan and 30 cents in a burst. Maigali Mitsui then blocked the US dollar in June at 4375. Hengyu Zhaofeng Chang Zhengchang repeatedly came to sell, and saw the downstream. The HSBC listing was announced, and the British rate was down 125, and the US rate did not move. At this time, it hovered around 6 yuan. Later, the Oran sold the US dollar for the current month to Huabi for 3125. Yuankangxiang Dadecheng sold the strips and retreated to 4 yuan. Before long, the US dollar at 875 in September was difficult to sell. Hengxing sold vigorously, and Fuchang also sold, falling to within 3 yuan. Tianfeng Yongchunyu Yong sold to within 1 yuan. Maigali pulled the US dollar at 9375 in September. Although there was a rebound, Hengxing Bingxing Fensin sold, and it still fell to within 1 yuan. Yuankangxiang Fuyu sold the strips, and the people's hearts were uncertain, so it broke the 70 yuan mark. Zhaofeng Chang Fuyu Qianchangxiang sold again to 66 yuan and 50 cents. This was because the US dollar was 25 yuan in September and 8125 in August, and no one asked. Pan Gen ate the US dollar at 875 in August and rebounded by 2 yuan. As soon as the US dollar turned, the US dollar was sold at 0625 in September. Chunyu Yong sold to within 7 yuan. Xingye Shanghai blocked 0625 in September. Fuyu sold the strips vigorously, and it fell to 64 yuan. Wanxing entered the strips, and Zhifeng Yongrui also bought them, and the shape was stable. HSBC Citibank came to accept the US dollar at 0625 in July. The Dalian gang tried hard to buy. Yuanheng Hengxing also sold it, and Citibank ate 25 yuan in September again, so it rose to 70 yuan. Fuchang and the broken shorts made up, and it rose to 70 yuan and 50 cents again. Before long, it fell back to 968 yuan and 80 cents in the afternoon. Zhifeng Yong sold the strips. The goods were auctioned at 8 yuan and a half. Finally, they still stood at 9 yuan. The highest price during the half day was 977 yuan and 30 cents, and the lowest price was 964 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 13 yuan and 30 cents. As a result, the closing price fell back by 6 yuan. The issue price was based on the fact that HSBC Bank's US exchange rate did not move, and it was still calculated at 23 yuan and 875. The alloy price was 1005 yuan, 20 cents and 4 cents. According to the closing price, it was about 36 yuan, which was 6 yuan more than the previous close. The registration price for this month was 1001 yuan, 981 yuan in June, and 969 yuan in July. The morning make-up water was 1001 yuan. The cooking price was calculated without adding 60 yuan yesterday. The custom gang also lacked supply, so there were few transactions in the market. Taikang Run had more than 100 liang of supply, which must be added by 63 yuan. At the beginning of the swap, the issue price was close to the lack of shorts, and later, the issue price lacked more parties. There were no formal transactions in the market. There were still 2219 strips left in this month, and 5516 strips in June.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was not very enthusiastic, and it only started to turn strong at the end. In summary, Hengxing Fuyu Chunyu Yong Tianfeng Yong Qianchangxiang Yuanmaoyong and others all came out. Yifeng Yong Wanxing Shunli Zhaofeng Chang Daxing Yong Ruixing Zhifeng Yong Yuanmao and others entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing squeezed in more than 600 strips, and Shunli also bought more than 200 strips. The Guangbang Hengxing sold a total of 4500 strips. The total number of chips in July was 17,990 strips.</p>

The near-term opening showed that the British rate was flat and the US rate was slightly firm. The selling price was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 9375 for the British exchange rate, and 24 yuan and 25 cents for the US exchange rate. After the opening, the trend tightened. The bank's buying appetite was extremely keen. Before long, it returned to a flat trend. The gold industry sold heavily. After entering the market, HSBC's listed British rate fell by 125 and the US rate did not move. The announcement then showed a loose trend. However, it was a bank-to-bank transaction. After that, it gradually hardened. The near-noon closing showed a slight recovery, but it was still harder than the morning opening. The noon closing selling price was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 875 for the near-term British exchange rate, and 24 yuan and 375 for the US exchange rate. The British rate was tighter by 0625 than the previous close, and the US rate was harder by 1875. The banking industry Citibank pulled vigorously.

<h3 id="e249">Guangdong Coins Still Plunge Severely <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small silver dollars were both 849 yuan in the morning and midday markets, seemingly</p>
<p>1.5 yuan higher than the previous day's morning market, but actually falling by more than one yuan compared to the previous morning. Trading volume was 5,500 in the morning and 2,000 in the midday session. The decline in Guangdong small silver dollars was very intense, continuing to fall yesterday. The morning market was at 776.9 yuan, down 1.2 yuan from the previous midday. The midday session continued to fall by 9 cents, reaching 776 yuan, resulting in a total drop of more than two yuan. The trading volume was 115,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the midday session. Copper coins were at 314,500 cash, an increase of 500 cash compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e250">Securities <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Government bonds only saw two trading sessions, the market was dull and volume declined, prices softened slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, government bonds for this month had already ceased, only</p>
<p>doing June for one month. Due to busy daily transactions, the opening was temporarily changed to 10:30 AM, with one session each in the morning and afternoon for organization. The market suddenly turned sluggish, and trading volume also decreased significantly, greatly differing from the previous day's trading. Although Tianjin has entered a truce, whether peace is expected is difficult to judge due to the harsh conditions, and the short positions of the previous day mostly squeezed out, making the longs unusually strong, thus gradually becoming crowded. In the morning session, the rising trend of the previous day seemed to remain, with various bonds rising by one to three cents, except for salt tax, which rose by a small amount of three cents and five points. In the afternoon session, many groups sold, but they were all scattered individual transactions, and the price of cloth generally fell uniformly by 1.2 cents to 4.5 cents, resulting in a slightly smaller one to six cent drop compared to the previous day. The situation seemed to be a large rise with small retracements, but if there are changes in peace, the crowding in the market may cause a reaction. Therefore, future situations are still subject to change depending on whether peace is achieved. The total transaction volume was 5,288,000 yuan, including 8,000 yuan in spot and 1,890,000 in salt tax futures, 855,500 in Sharp Troops, and the rest were only tens of thousands to 300,000 to 400,000.</p>
<h3 id="e251">New York Stock Prices Surge Again <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>A report from the New Fung Hong Kong states that New York stocks and</p>
<p>goods rebounded on Tuesday (the 23rd), due to the decline of the US dollar, and to stabilize it before the economic conference. The total volume traded was 3.14 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrials　83.06　Up 3.12</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　9.23　Up 1.96</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　28.22　Up 0.91</p>
<p>40 Bonds　　　82.00　Up 0.14</p>
<h3 id="e252">Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Both Yarn and Cotton Rose</p>
<p>The yarn market is firming up, but the rising trend has not been ignited because most people are psychologically tired, and there are still many sellers. However, overseas cotton showed signs of turning around, and</p>
<p>several local factories, due to high cotton prices and shortages, completely suspended night shifts from June 1st to maintain their capital. Therefore, a large amount was being absorbed to go long, but actual demand remained sluggish, which was a slight drawback.</p>
<p>Man-Mark Rose By Half a Yuan to 1.6 Yuan</p>
<p>The Man-Mark opened before noon, and as foreign cotton rose, confidence was</p>
<p>boosted, and buying interest was quite strong, with each month rising 1.78 yuan. After two or three auctions, those who made a profit closed out, and each month saw a retracement. As a result, each month rose by 0.4, 0.5, 0.7 cents to 1.1 yuan. The afternoon opening remained flat, but the situation suddenly tightened at closing, and each month rose by 1.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 cents. The total volume traded for the day was 40,100 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 1,000 bales, Rongxing 1,400 bales, Tongxing 1,250 bales, Yichang 1,400 bales, and Lichang 1,350 bales. Dafeng bought 1,100 bales, Biaolong 2,150 bales, Changfeng 1,200 bales, and Yuande 800 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Man-Mark Closing, Rise and Fall, Account Balance: August 1970, up 1,361,000; May 190, up 515,850; September 808, up 466,600; July 1946, up 164,550; Total 274,250</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Did 650 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were average, but more than yesterday. A check of the daily</p>
<p>statistics from various groups showed that 650 bales were bought, and the market rose by five cents. The purchase amounts of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 190, Xiamen 35, Wuhu 50, Ningbo 20, Nanyang 8, Fujian 1, Mainland 20, Sichuan 75, Nanjing 10, Yunnan 40, Peers 190</p>
<p>The cotton market is extremely firm, and the rising trend is appearing daily, because U.S. cotton rebounded, and local cotton</p>
<p>inventory is thin, and sources from all sides are scarce. It is also heard that a certain merchant is actively searching for spot cotton in the market, so people's hearts are getting harder and new buyers are becoming more active. In short, if foreign cotton continues to rise, local cotton may experience a drastic increase because chips are too scarce.</p>
<p>Zheng-Mark Rose By Six, Seven, and Eight Cents</p>
<p>Zheng-Mark opened before noon. Due to the large increase in U.S. cotton, the atmosphere in the market was strong, and buying</p>
<p>interest was especially strong, with the near month rising 0.24 yuan. The situation remained tight in the afternoon, and each month rose by another 0.3 and 0.4 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 93,900 dan. It was found that Shenchang sold 5,500 dan, Rongxing 2,100 dan, Yuanxing 2,500 dan, Deji 2,200 dan, Yuanda 2,700 dan, and Tongxing 1,900 dan. Jifeng bought 3,300 dan, Gengfeng 7,900 dan, Renfeng 2,300 dan, Changfeng 8,600 dan, Yifeng 3,800 dan, and Mingde 2,400 dan. The closing prices are as follows: Zheng-Mark Closing, Compared to the Previous Day, Account Balance: August 4690, up 75,153,000; May 4650, up 30,298,000; October 4575, up 70,988,000; June 4690, up 65,127,700; Total 537,100; July 4700, up 80,147,800</p>

<h3 id="e270">Nonsense <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>To adapt to the needs of the times, I once wanted to organize a "Nonsense Company" to serve all aspects of society. It is a pity that it did not succeed, otherwise it could have helped and shown off in the grand movements of saving the country through dancing, saving the country through opera, saving the country through entertainment, saving the country through religious services, and even saving the country through exhibitions. It is not that I say that these things are entirely nonsense, I want to advocate that nonsense can also be a start to saving the country.</p>
<p>This clearly does not refer to the national salvation tone of Dr. Hu Shih, nor is it the movie stars Hu Die, Hu Shan, Hu Jia Ping, etc., nor the tones of musical instruments such as the huqin and the drum. Nonsense is just nonsense in Shanghai dialect. The characteristic of nonsense lies in its inexplicable, dazed and confused, but the surface is very enthusiastic, very decent, and extremely serious. The most wonderful thing is that the people who do it know that it is impossible to do, they know that it has no effect, but they still bite the bullet and do it, with an unattainable spirit. At the beginning, there was indeed the fearless spirit of the Buddha saying that if I don’t go to hell, who will, but the result is a mess, and you can’t blame him.</p>
<p>From ancient times, judging the good and evil of deeds depends on the motive. It is the behavior of snobbish villains to judge heroes by success or failure. The result of nonsense is naturally that there are few successes and many failures, but this does not prevent it from being a good deed. Moreover, there are many ways to save the country. If everyone insists that what they are advocating is the only way to save the country, it will inevitably lead to internal strife before the country is saved, which is extremely shameful, so nonsense is indispensable. Nonsense means harmony everywhere, and agreement everywhere. Saying what others say and echoing what others say is the characteristic of nonsense. Following in footsteps like a shadow is also a characteristic of nonsense. Moreover, there are also those who surpass the scope of echoing and imitating and bravely advance forward. They can march and send troops without goals or plans, and execute affairs without preconceived ideas. That spirit of courage is really beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Courage is courage, but it is not enthusiastic. If this road does not work, you can take another one, which is also walking casually, without any choice. There is no attachment at all, and the ability to be extremely round and smooth, because there is no overall predetermined plan, so it doesn’t matter how you change it, and that’s where the ease of living of nonsense lies. They are always optimistic, and there are solutions to everything, but the result is that nothing goes wrong. Nonsense is the brotherhood of confusion.</p>
<p>Nonsense will never have a clear attitude, and it is not allowed to have it, because it is inherently vague and obscure. Things seem to be in progress and seem to be stagnant, the attitude seems to be affirmative and seems to be negative. Unless it is beyond saving, nonsense will never fail, and by that time, even if it is not nonsense, it will fail. Speaking of it, it is a kind of aging and twilight. The Chinese nation is on the verge of aging, and there is a lot of nonsense everywhere. From now on, governing and saving the country cannot be a major plan without nonsense. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e271">Dongting and West Lake <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>I grew up by Dongting Lake; however, from a young age, I was</p>
<p>in awe of West Lake's great reputation. Every time I read the line, "To compare West Lake to Xi Shi, whether lightly or heavily adorned, both are fitting," a vision of an unparalleled beauty stirred in my young heart, reflecting a bright and beautiful West Lake.</p>
<p>I've been away from my hometown for six or seven years. The vast expanse of eight hundred *li*,</p>
<p>where the lake and sky blend into one at Dongting, truly makes me yearn in my dreams. However, last autumn, I went to visit the West Lake, which I had long admired. I nestled in the embrace of Xi Shi, and although it was only for three short days, I saw the West Lake in its sunny splendor, its somber mood, and after the rain. I truly thank Heaven for such thorough arrangements for me.</p>
<p>West Lake is indeed exceptionally beautiful, a</p>
<p>quintessential image of Eastern beauty. In its sunny disposition, it is so bright and lovely; in its somber mood, it is so dignified; and after the rain, it is like a freshly bathed beauty, lightly veiled in silk, further enhancing its allure. After touring West Lake, I couldn't help but exclaim, "My hometown has no such beautiful lakes and mountains!"</p>
<p>However, to say, "My hometown has no such beautiful lakes and mountains," is, after all,</p>
<p>an affront to Dongting. Who can say Dongting Lake is not beautiful? However, Dongting's beauty is of a different kind. If we say West Lake is a beauty, then Dongting can be described as a hero. Because Dongting is magnificent, not exquisite; it is grand, not bright. There are no willows dancing in the spring breeze, nor warbling orioles, only colossal waves crashing against the sky, roaring out ancient songs of injustice. The raging torrents rush eastward, sweeping away figures from throughout history. There are no young men and women gently rowing in small boats, whispering sweet nothings, only giant warships racing by, black smoke rising into the air, and deep within the reeds, numerous heroic figures of the rivers and lakes, commanding wind and thunder. Facing the boundless lake where the sky and water meet, and the ever-changing scenery shrouded in mist, one can only stand upright and gaze from afar, solemnly concentrating. The sky is always so vast, the lake always so wide, that even if you want to praise it, you cannot find a suitable eulogy. Fan Zhongyan, in his *Yueyang Tower Record*, described Dongting as: "Surrounded by distant mountains, swallowing long rivers, vast and boundless, with no end in sight; sunrise glow and evening shadows, myriad phenomena." I think this is still insufficient to describe the grandeur and magnificence of Dongting.</p>
<p>West Lake, after all, is exquisite. Precisely because it is exquisite,</p>
<p>people can play with it. All around the lake roads, cars roll by. Beneath Baochu Pagoda, red buildings are hidden. All the dignitaries and wealthy, the vulgar city monks, all with the intention of buying a smile with a thousand gold coins, squeeze into West Lake's embrace. Boats in the lake are as numerous as carp. Red men and green women, strings and songs. When the breeze rises, the lake water also ripples with a golden smile. It has already put on a capitalist coat and has become a courtesan. It no longer has that natural and simple beauty. Compared to Dongting, which can only be viewed from afar and not be profaned, West Lake should feel sorry for itself and pale in comparison.</p>
<p>In Dongting Lake, there is Jun Mountain, a verdant</p>
<p>dot, just like a blue snail in a crystal plate. On the mountain are the Langyin Pavilion and the Tingtao Pavilion. There are the tombs of Emperors Ehuang and Nuying, the well from which Liu Yi once descended into the sea to deliver a letter for the Dragon Princess, and bamboo stalks marked with tear stains. Yueyang Tower stands majestically across the bank, facing it solemnly. Fishermen's songs rise and fall by the lakeside, and the sound of oars echoes gently. It is truly a natural painting, beautiful, good, and true.</p>
<p>It has been seven years since I left Dongting Lake. I ask, have the</p>
<p>sand and dust of my hometown covered the footprints of my youthful wanderings? Raising my head and looking west, I often feel deeply lost. A message to the lake and mountains: if the lake and mountains remain unchanged in the future, I shall return. Written in Shanghai on May 24th.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Little Local Tyrant <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>This was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. When Shurong led me into a refined and clean small Western-style building, I truly</p>
<p>couldn't believe that such a house could be found in Longyan.</p>
<p>"Hey, how can there be such a nice house in Longyan?"</p>
<p>"We must thank the owner of this house, that local tyrant gentry!" she replied with a smiling face and a slightly comical tone.</p>
<p>"Ah, so it belongs to a local tyrant gentry! No wonder it's so</p>
<p>beautiful."</p>
<p>Although I said it was beautiful, compared to the Western-style houses in Shanghai, this could only be considered a dilapidated toilet. Although the house had two stories and its architectural style was somewhat Westernized, it had been damaged by the army, and the doors, window railings, etc. were all gone. The walls were covered with various slogans. Shurong had only made two doors after she arrived, but there were still no windows, and the large holes were only covered with two large sheets of paper.</p>
<p>"How can this have any ventilation?" When Shu brought me to</p>
<p>the room she had prepared for me, I cried out as soon as I entered the door. It turned out that the beautiful house was just an embroidered pillow.</p>
<p>"Hey, you still complain about the lack of ventilation. You won't find a second</p>
<p>house as good as this in Longyan. Don't underestimate it. You'd be scared to death if you saw the houses the common people live in, which truly have no ventilation and no light."</p>
<p>...After listening to Shu's words, I could only stick out my tongue. I couldn't help but feel dissatisfied and hurriedly piled the bedding on the bed frame. When I saw the drawerless table, supported by only a broken board and four legs, I was disappointed again.</p>
<p>"Do you know how much effort it took to borrow this table from</p>
<p>their office?" Shu seemed to have seen what I was thinking, so she explained it to me very carefully. I was naturally very grateful to her. A room with bare walls like this... Shi's family... exclusively he... borrowed two stools for me, otherwise, I would have to stand at attention as soon as I entered the door.</p>
<p>The first time I saw the woman whose two eyes were fixedly</p>
<p>staring at me, she greeted Shu with a smile. Shu told her that I had just come from Zhangzhou today.</p>
<p>"Who is this woman?" I was a little surprised at how familiar Shu seemed</p>
<p>with her.</p>
<p>"She's the owner of the house, the wife of the local tyrant</p>
<p>gentry."</p>
<p>"Where's her husband?"</p>
<p>"He ran away to Xiamen and hasn't come back yet."</p>
<p>"Does she still have any property?"</p>
<p>"No, all her fields have been taken to be distributed to the</p>
<p>peasants. She has nothing else. She's really pitiful now. Her ten-year-old daughter picks coal every day, and her two sons are too young and can only eat. Therefore, her life has been getting poorer and poorer lately."</p>
<p>"This is the result the local tyrant gentry deserves."</p>
<p>"Look, this is her youngest son. Look</p>
<p>at how fierce and stupid he looks. His two big eyes are like a tiger's eyes, with that kind of foolish and dull expression, as annoying as a pig."</p>
<p>Observing the little local tyrant standing next to me, his two eyes were indeed particularly large, almost like bull's eyes, but the light shining from them was dull, stagnant, foolish, and annoying. Xiao Hang told me that no matter what you asked him, he would always stand at attention and answer, and with particular vigor. For example, if you asked him, "Have you eaten yet?" "Yes!"</p>
<p>"Don't stand here!" "Yes!" His tone and attitude were exactly like a soldier treating his superior officer, truly amusing. (To be continued)</p>

<p>In this day and age, it is difficult to speak, and even more difficult to wield a pen. This</p>
<p>isn't to say: "Fortune and misfortune have no doors, it is only men who invite them." It really is "The world has this," and "common people" should "not discuss." The editor respectfully offers a heartfelt plea to all the literary giants in the country: from now on, talk more about romance and less about complaints, so that both the author and the editor can have a rest. If you must discuss lengths and shortcomings, and recklessly talk about important matters, then to stuff it into the wastebasket is something we cannot bear to do, and to publish it on the news is something we cannot do, trapping the editor in a dilemma, which is inevitably lacking in empathy. As the saying goes, "Those who understand the times are outstanding," and the editor dares to say this to all the literary giants in the country. This humble plight, please understand and consider.

<h3 id="e274">Carrot Top <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Written by JULES KENARA, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Red Cheeks Two (Continued)</p>
<p>Carrot Top peeped for a long time again. He was afraid that Weiaolong would suddenly run back, but Masuo had already curled up into a ball and covered his head with the quilt, but he was not asleep. He was recalling the inexplicable event that had just occurred. He did not see anything in this matter that could make him suffer. In the dark quilt, the image of Weiaolong clearly floated before his eyes, and this image was as gentle as the images of those women who often excited him in his dreams.</p>
<p>Carrot Top was too lazy to wait any longer. His eyelids closed as if feeling magnetic force. He forced himself to open his eyes and look at the very small gas lamp: but after three small bubbles appeared from the lamp nozzle, making soft sounds, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The next morning, when everyone washed their faces with basins, dipped the corner of a towel in a little cold water, and gently wiped their cold cheekbones, Carrot Top glared fiercely at Masuo, and tried his best to look savage. He gritted his teeth and scolded him in a shrill voice:</p>
<p>"Rabbit! Rabbit!"</p>
<p>Masuo's cheeks flushed red, but he still answered him gently, and almost with a pleading look:</p>
<p>"Since I told you that nothing happened, what are you making a fuss about!"</p>
<p>The school supervisor came to check if their hands were clean. The students stood in two rows, mechanically stretched out their hands, first the backs of their hands, and then quickly turned their hands over, and immediately retracted them to a warm place - inserted in their pockets, or stuffed into the lukewarm down quilt of a nearby bed. Usually, Weiaolong did not look carefully, but today, unfortunately, he found that Carrot Top's hands were not clean. Ordered to go to the faucet to wash again, Carrot Top felt dissatisfied. In fact, there were some blue stains on his hands, but Carrot Top stubbornly said that this was the precursor to frostbite. Someone must have a personal grudge against him.</p>
<p>Weiaolong had to send him to the headmaster's office.</p>
<p>The headmaster, who had gotten up early, was preparing a history lesson in his office, which was wallpapered with a dim green color, to teach to the older students when he had free time. He forcefully tapped his fat fingers on the table, distinguishing various major stages: here was the decline of the Roman Empire; in the middle was the Turkish invasion of Constantinople; a little further was the endless modern history that no one knew when it began.</p>
<p>He was wearing a large nightgown, and several silk ribbons held up his firm chest, like ropes tied to stone pillars. Obviously, this gentleman ate too much; the lines on his face were coarse and slightly shiny. He spoke in a loud voice, the same as when he spoke to the ladies; the wrinkles on his neck undulated slowly and rhythmically on his stiff collar. Also, his round eyes and thick mustache were very noticeable.</p>
<p>Carrot Top stood in front of him, taking off his hat and placing it between his legs, so as to maintain freedom of movement.</p>
<p>The headmaster asked in a terrible voice:</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Sir, the school supervisor said my hands were not clean and sent me here, but this is a false accusation!"</p>
<p>Carrot Top confidently stretched out his hands again, first the backs of his hands, and then turned them over. He turned his hands back and forth, proving that the school supervisor had wronged him.</p>
<p>"Ah! Wronged you!" the headmaster said, "Four days of holiday ban, my child!"</p>

<h3 id="e275">Adam and Eve <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>The Adam and Eve of the Bible are as absurd and groundless as Pangu in Chinese history. Whether</p>
<p>they existed as people or events is still a question. Unexpectedly, a Reuters dispatch yesterday from Turkey said that the Turkish people have now made a new discovery that Adam and Eve were indeed produced in that region. Because of various textual researches on the word "family" and "era," Adam and Eve are determined to be Turkish people, just like someone with the surname Zhou insists on recognizing King Wen as their ancestor, and someone with the surname Jiang insists on recognizing Taigong as their family origin. It is equally laughable. But I dare not say whether Adam and Eve admit this. I can only put this matter aside and ask Adam and Eve before talking about it again.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Harbin on the 21st said that the nudist society in this area recently formed a club, named it "Adam and Eve," and held its first meeting in Krestovsky, and on the island</p>
<p>they sunbathed naked for three hours, etc.</p>
<p>I highly approve. Adam and Eve were originally men and women who did not wear pants, and were the ancestors of the primitive era. Since sunbathing was invented abroad, it has become quite popular in various places. Last year, Hong Kong also had such an organization, with both Chinese and foreign men and women. However, foreign women were still shy, and although they joined, they did not actually practice it. Only the Chinese women who joined were very enthusiastic. From this point of view, foreign women are not thoroughly civilized, and Chinese women are thoroughly civilized. Taking the Chinese women of recent years as an example, marriage is absolutely free, the fashion is constantly changing, and the three thousand worries of hair are also cut clean. Such innovative styles are all well-organized. From these many behaviors, one can see the degree of civilization of Chinese women.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear from the dispatch whether there are Chinese women participating in the current "Harbin Adam and Eve Society," so I dare not speculate. But based on the facts, I am afraid that Chinese women are not without participation. Soviet Russia is originally a communist country, not only communist, but also has communal wives. The marriage system has long been completely overthrown. However, under certain circumstances, as long as the other party agrees, they can be husband and wife for a short period of time. Therefore, nakedness or non-nakedness is originally not a problem. But China still has some constraints of the marriage system in freedom, and there is still some unfreedom. Therefore, Chinese people like sunbathing, and Russians naturally agree. Even I personally would never oppose it, for two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Cultural progress is originally a reductionist style. Life in the past was more comfortable every day, but life now is more difficult every day. Culture in the past progressed step by step, but culture now regresses step by step. That is, everything else is like this. These are all reductionist performances. Therefore, Mencius said, "The difference between humans and animals is slight." The scholars of the rationalist school noted, "Slight means that it can be known that there is originally no great difference between humans and animals." Going a step further, humans are only one of the animals, then why can't animals be naked?</p>
<p>(2) Didn't the Premier say that the greatest elements of life are clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and that clothing is the first of the four major elements? Of course, the problem of clothing and food is the most difficult to solve. If everyone did not wear clothes, wouldn't they save a lot of trouble and countless economies? The *huaer sha* of summer and the brocade *zhou* of winter, etc., would not be needed. The first element of the four major elements would not be difficult. Wouldn't it be interesting if the world were full of men and women who did not wear pants?</p>
<p>Based on the above two reasons, I extremely approve of "Adam and Eveism." Originally, it is most fashionable now to go barefoot and not wear socks. If you don't even wear pants, wouldn't it be even more fashionable? Amen.</p>

<p>— Huai Zhuang</p>
<p>An unfortunate event finally befell Min'er. Her</p>
<p>loving father and mother both abandoned this adorable little bird, intending to ascend to heaven alone. Thus, the responsibility of raising her naturally falls to her uncle.</p>
<p>"Min'er," on the fourth day Min'er was at her uncle's house, her aunt urged her, "You are already</p>
<p>fifteen years old, and still just love to play. Haven't you seen the daughter of Wang's mother next door? She, at thirteen years old, gets up early to wipe the tables, clean the windows, make the bed, and sweep the floor. There is nothing she can't do. During the day when she has free time, she also takes the frame and learns to embroider!"</p>
<p>"Unlike you..." Her aunt pointed at her,</p>
<p>continuing to speak, her tone seeming to become heavier, and from her face it could be seen that she had a disdainful expression. "Humph! Aren't you just a world apart from her?"</p>
<p>Also, the old woman across the street also said that today's women</p>
<p>are truly a joke. All day long, they don't know what they are doing. They have only learned many skills of flirting! Alas! Heaven knows! When they go to their husband's house in the future, I really don't know how much suffering they will have to endure!</p>
<p>"Min'er, if you don't listen to me now, in the future,</p>
<p>if no one comes to marry you, then don't blame me." Her aunt's tone was relatively soft. Then, she pointed to the coal briquette stove leaning against the wall in the kitchen and said, "Be good. Quickly light this coal briquette stove. Later, when your elder sister (her own daughter) gets up, she can go to school earlier!"</p>
<p>After half an hour of trying, Min'er finally failed.</p>
<p>Black coal dust stained her hands and face. At the same time, her tears also fell because of the coal gas. But her aunt still scolded her "stupid bug" over and over again.</p>
<p>At eight-thirty, Qianjie finally woke up from her pink dream. Because the coal stove was lit slowly today, the soup hadn't been stewed yet, so she just sat on the edge of the bed and got angry.</p>
<p>"Qian'er," Min'er's aunt said, "My good girl, don't</p>
<p>be angry. It's all Min'er's fault. Later, I will scold her severely." Pausing, she said as she bent down to button the unbuttoned clothes for her daughter, speaking softly and gently, "Your Indian silk *qipao* can be finished before lunch. This afternoon you can go to the movies with Yuanyuan across the street. Also, your rouge is used up, so you can buy some on the way."</p>
<p>"Get up quickly! Don't be angry!"</p>
<p>Qianjie's anger subsided a bit. She simply lay down on the</p>
<p>bed and acted spoiled, saying, "Then, where are my high-heeled leather shoes?"</p>
<p>"Those high-heeled leather shoes? Don't worry! I already</p>
<p>asked your father to buy them."</p>
<p>At this time, Qianjie's laughter and Min'er's sobs</p>
<p>had inadvertently become the symphony of life.</p>
<p>The water on the coal stove boiled, only making sounds in the pot,</p>
<p>as if decorating this ordinary tragedy.</p>

<p>Shop Assistant Correspondence</p>
<p>I Want to Redeem Myself</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am not a shop assistant, nor an apprentice; I am a seventeen-year-old weak woman, wandering in a foreign land, without any relatives to rely on. Can you make an exception and reply to all my questions? Sir, I hope you will not despise me because of this, and help me find a bright future.</p>
<p>In the year I was born, my mother passed away; my father then married a stepmother. Unfortunately, when I was three years old, my father also passed away. The cruel stepmother sold me into a family when I was five years old to be a maid. At first, they treated me well and even sent me to school. Now, they treat me badly; if they are unhappy, they treat me as a "venting tool," beating and scolding me; they no longer let me study. I really cannot bear this ill-treatment and have long wanted to escape this prison. Currently, I have a friend who is willing to help me and even allow me to continue my studies. Therefore, I want to redeem myself. When they bought me, they spent seventy-five yuan, studying at a certain school cost sixty yuan, and studying at another school cost thirty yuan. I think I should give them one hundred and sixty-five yuan. Is this legally permissible? What should I do if they refuse?</p>
<p>Sir, please answer me. I am here, eagerly awaiting your response! Please do not disappoint me! Sincerely wish you good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Li Cuiying</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Trafficking in persons is prohibited; indentures of servitude cannot be presented to the authorities. If you want to regain your freedom, you only need to hire a lawyer to write a letter to your master, expressing your intention, and at the same time, file a statement on your behalf. Now that you acknowledge that they treated you fairly well in the past and even allowed you to study, you are willing to give them one hundred and sixty-five yuan, which is already considered benevolent and just. In theory, they should agree immediately. If, by any chance, they refuse, you can seek legal assistance; with one hundred and sixty-five yuan, all the procedures can probably be handled properly.</p>
<p>However, you are only seventeen years old this year, and your experience is not yet deep enough. What is the relationship between that friend of yours and you? Is he a good person? Why is he willing to help you? Does he have an ulterior motive? Is his motive legitimate? You need to consider all these things carefully. If you are deceived by a wicked person for a moment and act rashly, or even cohabit with him, then your suffering will be endless! According to your letter, your current master cannot be considered extremely cruel, and the relationship of servitude can be terminated at any time. Cohabiting with a wicked person is like "trying to catch dry ashes in a leaky hand," and we cannot foresee what will happen to you! This is our concern; may the ladies carefully consider this themselves.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Fifteen: Competition</p>
<p>The next morning, very early, Miss Liu kissed Wenbin's forehead with sleepy eyes, stroking his blushing cheeks with infinite tenderness, revealing a bit of lingering affection. But the one sleeping in her arms was still sound asleep, from which it could be known that this night was indeed filled with indescribable deep love. Afterwards, Miss Liu suddenly realized that he should no longer be sleeping soundly on her bed, so she decided to wake him up. When he woke up and hugged her tightly again, she said:</p>
<p>"Poor child, you can go now."</p>
<p>"What? You're telling me to leave?"</p>
<p>"Yes, child. Because now is the time when you must leave here. Of course, I fully understand that I need your warmth, your embrace, but you also have to know that I can't fully commit myself to you yet. In fact, I have to serve other men who are more important than you. Darling, do you understand? I am sincerely loving you."</p>
<p>Of course, Zhang Wenbin could not help but be very unhappy, but unable to resist her gentle persuasion, he still lazily walked out of her room. But he always had to come back and ask her:</p>
<p>"Then who are you planning to receive now?"</p>
<p>"Why do you need to ask about this?" she said with a smile: "Darling, I'm telling you, you don't need to worry about my affairs. Now, go back and sleep well, quietly waiting for my orders. As long as it's convenient, maybe we can meet again tomorrow night. In short, please believe me, I have never loved any other man the way I love you. I feel that this is your greatest victory."</p>
<p>After he left, Manager Gu called once, saying that he couldn't come in the morning due to some business, and promised to see her again in the evening. On this day, Miss Liu was immersed in sweet memories. Perhaps this was the beginning of her luck. But in any case, she had now gained a new kind of stimulation, although this love made her excessively uneasy, as if her soul was bewitched by this newcomer.</p>
<p>Until the lights in the house were turned on again in the evening, and bank manager Mr. Gu was diligently pouring champagne for her, she was re-recognizing her life; she was still selling her life cheaply. However, Manager Gu was now indulging himself to the fullest; this was very clear to her.</p>
<p>After that, there was a burst of car horns outside, and Wu Gui was heard shouting in another room:</p>
<p>"Who's going to open the door? Another guest is here!"</p>
<p>Then He Xiang walked closer to Miss Liu and whispered a few words. Then she looked at Manager Gu and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"What's wrong with that? You bring her up here. Anyway, everyone knows each other."</p>
<p>"Who? Who's coming?" Manager Gu asked:</p>
<p>"She'll be here soon. You wait and see."</p>
<p>After a while, Minister Su walked in wearing brand new clothes. The manager immediately stood up and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you! Great! Great! Please sit down, please sit down. Hey, tell them to bring another glass!"</p>
<p>"Really, I didn't expect that we would meet here," Minister Su said as he sat down, stealing a glance at Miss Liu and then very politely greeting Manager Gu: "It's really great that we can talk here. Mr. Gu often comes here to visit?"</p>
<p>"No, today is the first time I've met Miss Yang."</p>
<p>"Oh? Me too; I only met her the day before yesterday."</p>
<p>"Then you have one more day of friendship than I do."</p>
<p>They were both very smart, and both believed that they were good at rhetoric. Only Miss Liu laughed loudly and immediately raised her glass and took a sip. Unfortunately, it caused a strong cough. Probably because the wine flowed into her trachea, this strong cough could not be stopped for a while. Until she ran into the bedroom and saw bloodstains in the sputum container, she could not help but wipe away her tears and sigh deeply. However, at this time, the two Chinese giants outside, she believed, must be having a very投機conversation.</p>

<h3 id="e282">"Piano Heart Ripple" Performed at the Grand Theater <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Xiang</p>
<p>The long-publicized pantomime "Piano Heart Ripple" premiered at the Grand Theater on the 21st. The play can be regarded as the first collaboration between Chinese drama and symphony music. Judging from the performance results, it can be said to be a success.</p>
<p>The evening's program was divided into three sections. The first section was Chinese ancient music. First, the Datong Orchestra played Eastern music; the society has long been famous in society, and this time, participating in the grand event, both sides felt that they added luster to each other. The second was Wei Jun's pipa solo. This gentleman's technique is skilled, and the song "Huaiyin Pingchu" is even more sonorous, winning a lot of applause from the audience.</p>
<p>The second section was the symphonic works of the composer Afu Xia Lomufu. First, Mrs. Liu Jingfang sang Afu's "Qingwen's Death Song." The lyrics were compiled by Mr. Zhu Manhua, and the meaning of the words was very poignant. Unfortunately, when Mrs. Liu sang, the audience could only hear her voice and could not distinguish what words she was singing. This is probably because she has not received sufficient training in Chinese singing methods, and the movements of her mouth are not in accordance with the rules, so the pronunciation is not clear. As for the music of the song, perhaps it sounds very sad to Westerners, but to Chinese people, although it seems to be sad, it cannot evoke a lingering and weeping feeling. This is probably because Chinese and Western music have different reasons for expressing emotions!</p>
<p>After the singing, it was Afu's "Impression of Hutong in Beiping." In this song, the large tuning fork and gongs and cymbals used by barbers in the north were added to the Western string music and played together, which was very characteristic. It makes people feel a glimpse of life in the hutongs of Beiping from the music. When the performance ended, applause rang out, showing that the audience was very moved.</p>
<p>After the break, Mei Lanfang came on stage to introduce the play "Piano Heart Ripple," giving a brief speech, which was translated by a certain gentleman. Then the band began to play music, and the curtain was pulled open on both sides. The scenery was a palace and the shore of a lake, and the light and color were good. The most brilliant scene in the whole play was the fairy dance. The fairy was played by Ms. Yuan Meiyun, and her posture was very beautiful, her dance was extremely skilled, and she was in perfect harmony with the rhythm of the music, so when the dance ended, the audience applauded thunderously and were very satisfied. Among the other actors, the one who played the pianist was the best. The rest were also competent. The play is a pantomime, and all actions, words, and expressions are depicted with music, which is really not easy. Although we cannot say that this attempt is perfect, we are also very satisfied. This is a new path for Chinese old drama, and it has great potential for development. We hope that there will be opera attempts in the future, which will be a further step towards the improvement of Chinese old drama.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Review of "Double Dealing" <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>In the past two years, Constance Bennett's productions have been numerous and of excellent quality, which is really surprising. Let's take a look at this "Double Dealing" (TWO AGAINST THE WORLD) shown by Cathay, which she performed for Warner Bros. She used to play the role of an innocent and lively girl on the screen, or a young woman in passionate love with a capable person, but her roundabout style remained, and she became a smart, capable, and sophisticated girl. It can be described as "the capable can do anything."</p>
<p>I think the story is a bit like "Tess of the Storm Country." Constance's performance also has similarities to Janet Gaynor's. Roughly speaking, the sister of a rich girl had an affair, and her brother obtained the evidence. In order to avoid the breakdown between her sister and brother-in-law, she took on the dishonorable matter herself. Her brother was furious and killed her sister's lover; she went to save him, but it was too late. The court thought that she committed the crime, and she was wronged even more. Fortunately, her brother realized his mistake and surrendered himself. A young lawyer intervened. She also explained the reason why her brother killed the man, and the judge thought that there was a reason for it and did not punish him. She then married the good lawyer.</p>
<p>Although there is a happy ending, except for the last</p>
<p>section, there is little talk of love; instead, there is a powerful depiction of family ethics. This is more desirable, but there are still three major loopholes:</p>
<p>First: the handbag that her brother used as evidence</p>
<p>, since it was her sister's thing, even though she admitted it, her brother-in-law did not doubt it at all. How could he not know anything about his wife's belongings and daily actions? Is he a fool? Second: her sister had improper behavior, but later she acted as if she was not involved, without any self-condemnation or sad reflection, which also feels unreasonable. Third: since she was willing to take the blame for others, she should have admitted to the murder. Seeing a lawyer and explaining everything was unnecessary. This contradicts her original will. There were also some loopholes added during the performance. For example, after the gunshot, the doorman did not immediately enter the room; these should be the responsibility of the director. There is also a big doubt: the evidence that her brother obtained was only a handbag, and he did not recognize that it was dishonorable and obscure. He was willing to die for the sake of his family's reputation, but it still feels like he was too nervous. Moreover, since he surrendered himself, the barrel of the pistol and the style of the bullet made it easy to determine the evidence of the murder with detective observation. Why was the judge helpless and had to wait for the girl's confession to be able to decide the case? The director also used extremely gorgeous costumes to show the wealth of the girl's family, but this was like an insult to a capable and virtuous girl. Not every rich girl is extravagant and lustful! The photography, lighting, and transitions are all good. The scenery is grand and beautiful. Warner Bros. invested a considerable amount of capital in this film. In other places, the director also worked hard, and the whole film is quite tense. Although there are shortcomings in the story, consciousness, and skills, the film is still transcendent. Constance's performance is profound, which she has not shown in the past. She gives the audience a lot of emotional stimulation. Neil Hamilton, who played the lawyer, tried his best to imitate a young man who was unclear, impetuous, and fond of winning, which was just right. Allen Vincent, who played the brother, was a little angry, but he was better in the second half. The sister and all the other actors were mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Review of "The Flag Lieutenant" <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The British flagship held a dance party, and the heroes and beauties sang and danced, which was naturally a joyful and harmonious scene. There was a major named LTDICKY who kissed a general's daughter several times at that time, and their love words were lingering. Suddenly, he heard that the British fort was in urgent need and was surrounded by Arab people. The major and his close friend led troops to help. The major's friend volunteered to ask the flagship for help, but was injured by the enemy, so the major continued to go. When the reinforcements arrived, planes and cannons were mighty, and the Arabs were defeated. Afterwards, when rewards were given for meritorious service, the major attributed his great achievements to his friend, but in the end, rewards and punishments were clearly distinguished. In addition to receiving the reward, the major kissed the general's daughter again.</p>
<p>In this kind of story, what did the director do?</p>
<p>He used fragmentary short shots without large scenes. The war scenes were fake, there were only a very small number of frontal conflicts, and in some places, the war was simply treated as a child's play. Especially the noisy dialogue in the second half and the dull plot had a hypnotic effect. However, there were also a few beautiful shots, such as the flagship breaking through the vast sea at the beginning, especially when the army was concentrated at night, the clever lighting was really great. However, the director was ultimately a failure. There was nothing brilliant in the front, there was only one climax in the middle, but it passed by lightly.</p>
<p>Regarding the scenery, the fort was fake, which could be clearly seen. The devices in several parts of the flagship were repeated again and again. Other aspects were mediocre.</p>
<p>Regarding the actors, I don't think there is anyone who deserves</p>
<p>praise. Only the major's friend showed a loyal personality. The several female characters were not good. The comic characters were also unable to make people laugh.</p>
<p>Moreover, even in terms of the structure of the story, there are many problems. For example, the major's call for help was so coincidental. The major's refusal to accept the great achievements was also not very understandable.</p>
<p>In short, in any aspect, it is ordinary and there is no</p>
<p>distinctive feature, but it is not a complete failure.</p>
<p>Finally, let me talk about my personal feelings.</p>
<p>The translation name of "The Flag Lieutenant" is naturally very moving. If the content of the film grasped the heroic resistance of the weak nation and the victory in the extreme sacrifice, then this title would be appropriate. However, the content of "THE FLAG LIEUTENANT" is a blatant depiction of imperialism's invasion of colonies and the suppression of colonial resistance movements with all the most sophisticated weapons. When we see such a film at a time when armed soldiers are going deep into the territory and signing treaties under duress, who would not be heartbroken? After a massacre, the oppressors reward meritorious service and raise the cup of victory, but the invaded are lying dead. If the British flag that finally appeared on the screen was replaced with the Rising Sun flag, would we be able to calmly say that this aggressive war was indeed "The Flag Lieutenant"? Why not add a Chinese subtitle: "Long live imperialism"?</p>
<h3 id="e285">New Trend of Sound Cartoon Films <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Adopting fairy tales as the theme and using five-color brilliance</p>
<p>Some people say: "Since the invention of sound movies</p>
<p>, this sound cartoon film has had the greatest success!" Although this sentence is a bit arbitrary, it is also very reasonable. I think everyone who has seen the sound cartoon film before the feature film must feel the same way! We can prove that this is true from the fact that many people go to see cartoon films specifically without bothering to see the feature films. The harmony between the black lines and the syllables is so beautiful and magical!</p>
<p>However, the themes of these sound cartoon films are often just those mice (MICKEY MOUSE). In addition, there has never been any new development, and in terms of content, it is gradually found that there is a shortage of resources. Then, if this continues, will it not lose its reputation? Under this situation, what has emerged is Walt Disney's "Silly Symphony." It is more meaningful to move fairy tales to sound cartoon films to replace the mouse films that are about to decline.</p>
<p>However, is it too difficult to express fairy tales that are rich in fantasy with only black lines in mouse films? Therefore, five-color brilliance has also been used. In the "Silly Symphony" that has been adopted; in "Pirates and Mermaids," "Toyland," and "The Witch's Forest," in the "Pirates and Mermaids," when the mermaid is swimming in the ocean, it is painted with colorful brilliance, which can really lead people into the illusion of the "Land of Fairy Tales." It is said that the results of the trial screenings of these three episodes are very promising.</p>
<p>In the near future, we movie fans in Shanghai</p>
<p>will also be able to see these new types of sound cartoon films. Our eyes are really blessed!</p>
<p>Publication of the "Spring Tide" Movie Script</p>
<p>The long-rumored "Heming" sound film "Spring Tide" has</p>
<p>been completed for a long time, and has now passed inspection. It is said that it will be released in Shanghai at the end of this month. The "Spring Tide" script has been published by the Film Culture Bookstore. The script is written in great detail and is a necessary reference book for those who study film and love Yunying. It also includes more than ten photos and is priced at one jiao. Those who state that this newspaper is introduced should send seven fen in stamps to P.O. Box 2119, Shanghai.</p>

<p>The anecdote about Chaplin's childhood submitted by Zuiying Jun in this issue of May 20 was copied from the 19th issue of "Movie Life."

<h3 id="e287">Movie Novel: Eternal Regret (THE WHITE SISTER (9)) <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>Prince Charles Montede's face turned ashen, his brow furrowed in disappointment as he sat at his desk. He wondered what to do, but his heart had become a mass of sorrowful, dark, and chaotic emotions. He followed Mina's report that she had gone to the barracks. He immediately ordered the carriage to be prepared.</p>
<p>Although Angela arrived near the barracks, it was of no use. She couldn't get close to the gate. She shrank back at the sight of the sentries. Finally, she took a risk. She wrote a short note. The sentry promised to deliver it for her tomorrow. She got into the carriage and instructed the driver not to return to the palace, telling him to just drive, drive anywhere. She sat in the carriage, closed her eyes, and felt the carriage turning and winding along a long road from the barracks, and then slowly turning onto the main road. Suddenly, there was a violent collision. Everything went dark.</p>
<p>Angela slowly regained consciousness. She crawled out from under the carriage that had crashed into a ditch. A soldier ran to her side and asked if she was hurt. Her frightened eyes turned to a group of soldiers leaning over another wrecked carriage. Her frightened eyes recognized a strangely familiar carriage—her father's carriage!</p>
<p>'Is it him? Is it him?' Her lips and tongue were dry with horror.</p>
<p>'He is dead, Princess,' the soldier said quietly.</p>
<p>'Father!' she screamed. 'It can't be!' She wanted to rush to his side. But a kind shadow enveloped her. At this moment of crisis, Pastor Sala Sincere was her friend, her protector, her comforter.</p>
<p>The malicious people reveled in Prince Charles Montede's death, wagging their poisonous tongues. But Angela didn't care about the various rumors. The father who educated her and loved her, like a royal palace surrounded by high walls in a beautiful garden—her merciful father, on whom her whole being depended, had died a violent death, enough to make her wish she were dead. But remember, she must painfully remember in her heart that their last meeting was one of misunderstanding, staring angrily at each other—remember that he was chasing her, trying to rescue her from obscurity—remember that the carriage she was riding in that tragic night was the knife that killed her father—how could she forget this scene and this feeling?</p>
