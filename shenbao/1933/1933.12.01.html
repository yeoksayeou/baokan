<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c35">日本明年度預算的波折朝 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>日本高橋財長曾很樂觀地說過。「二十億的預算百億元的公債。並不足懼。日本國民不致因此而困疲的。」高橋財長在這樣樂觀的態度之下。終於使日本昭和八年度的預算。由六年度的十四億元。七年度的二十億元一躍至空前未有的二十三億元以上的巨額。</p>
<p>正在醖釀中的昭和九年度預算。除經常歳出十四億元外各部新規要求額尚有十二億元。又加上時局匡救費新規要求己達至十三四億元。假使高橋財長仍是以樂觀的態度來處置。即使不完全承認新規要求的全數。總預算額。也不難達到二十五六億元之鉅數。</p>
<p>但是高橋財長的態度轉變了。他現在他顧到「須與國力保持調和」了。因此昭和九年度的預算。經長期審查的結果。不惟新規要求的承認額削减了許多。經常歳出。也由十四億元减爲十二億元。經常歳出與臨時歳出。共定爲二十億元。</p>
<p>高橋財長這樣的腹案發表後。反對最激烈的。不待說是海陸兩部。依照大角海長的意見。爲預防一九三六年的嚴重危機。補救倫敦海軍會議所感到的缺陷。日本於昭和九十十一三年度的艦艇擴充費。至少須增加臨時費十二億五千萬元。但是財部審查的結果。由海部提出的明年度新規要求四億四千萬元中。財部僅承認一億七千八百萬元。其間相差之逺實屬可驚海長當然堅决地表示反對。高橋財長的腹案。能否平安地通過。尚是疑問。</p>
<p>由此看來。日本軍部與財閥政客間的衝突。仍是不斷地進展着此次對於明年度預算的衝突。特别厲害了。也許這就是齋藤内閣前途的暗礁。</p>
<p>日本軍部自九一八事變以來以「非常時」爲名。企圖推翻政黨政治而實現軍事獨裁。不惜絞盡日本民衆的血汗。以供其軍事冒險的犧牲。固然。處在今日由日本軍閥一手造成國際孤立的危險局勢下。以軍事上來說。日本確是在一個最嚴重的「非常時期。」但是日本軍閥。只是看得到自己一手造成的軍事上的「非常時。」而没有看到財政上的「非常時。」國力上的「非常時。」到了明年。日本的公債總額就快達九十億元了經常歳出的公債利息費。就要達至四億五千萬元了。約占總歳出的六分之一。約當歳入的三分之一。如果長此增加下去。僅由於公債的激增不是要使日本的財政宣告破產嗎。</p>
<p>一個國家的財政。不能只是顧到目前。必須考慮到將來在一兩年内日本的民衆。也許勉强能夠支持這樣巨大軍事費的負担。到了幾年以後。到了民貧財盡的時候。恐怕連最低限度的負担。也無能爲力了。這樣。誠如民政黨總裁若槻所說的「用骷髏去曳大砲」了。</p>
<p>現在。已往一味追隨着軍部意旨的高橋財長。也變更那過於樂觀的態度了。政友會和民政黨。也對高橋提出警告。勸其顧全大局但是日本的軍部當局。除非受到一次嚴重的教訓。是不會覺醒的。</p>
<p>結果。現在極其强硬化的高橋財長。不是完全屈服。或是另謀妥恊便是「走之大吉」而已。</p>

<p>十一月二十六日午間、留英同學會、假座華懋飯店、舉行聚餐、特請伍連德博士演講、題爲中英民族之特性、伍博士爲公共衞生學之權威、名揚中外、此次演講、對於中英民族之特性、詳搜細討、持論精闢、聽者掌聲雷動、兹將伍博士講詞撮述如下、</p>
<p>民族之特性、隊遺傳外、全視其環境而定故欲察民族之演變、當先考其祖始之狀况、世人不察、往往以種族愈純則愈强、如英人種族最純、故爲世界最張盛之民族、殊不知事實上乃大謬不然、今請述英國前總環鮑爾温氏之言論、鮑氏謂、英國曾在大羅馬帝國統治之下、故染成一種貴族銀味、繼爲撒克題征服、此族殘暴兇悍、乃加以一糧調劑、後有達航各處北歐民族之混入、其間接結果、造成開議英洲之始祖、最後受諾蔓民族之征服、變成北歐與法蘭西民族之混合、其一種團結特性·及國家觀念·亦均隨以顯著、今日之英人、所以富於合作精神、深於家庭觀念、含有幽試風味、并能　雄海上、移民遍全球者、實因其爲混合種族故也、</p>
<p>我國人對於混合種、來往往有一種誤解、自北平附近周口店之「北京人」遺跡發現後、或可推爲人類之始祖、兹姑舍而不論、今或可斷言者、即我漢民族之根據地、乃陜豫兩省、其時在五千餘年前、以後始逐漸向南北推進、我國之粤省人民、所以當於冒險性、而有進取精神者、實因其種族極端混合之故、内含有最初移民客家、獨攝·亞刺伯·馬來·還邏·高加索·各種之混合、彼等之子孫、亦幾遍海内外、如安南·馬來·荷屬印度·澳大利亞·加拿大·夏威夷·菲列濱·美利堅·尼哥來佛斯克等處、均有粤省僑民、如香港一埠、其社會之中堅、均爲粤人與英人之混合種、又如香港廣州上海之三大百貨公司、其創辦人、均爲澳大利亞之混合華僑、</p>
<p>吾人試一翻閱吾國歷史、當中國爲蒙古·匈奴·及滿州民族侵入時、因漢族之文化及團結性、較侵入民族爲高、乃漸成一種同化、而游牧民族之劣性、亦同時隨以吸入、惟非若英人能將羅馬·撒克遜·諾蔓·諸民族之優民性、盡量收入、是以今日之中國民族、缺乏團結性、過度發展傷人自私主謙、及毫無科學精神、推其原因、實由於吸入滿蒙低劣民性、致累及進化也、</p>
<p>伍博士繼謂、如欲研究歷史或某民族之特性、必須參　小品文字、尤以裨史小說爲佳、如讀斯高脫氏之小說、可知蘇格蘭之眞相、欲知英倫生活、莫善於瀏覽逖根斯及塞克雷之著作、我國人民之特性、亦可於小說中求得之、如羅貫中所著之三國演義、描寫民性、尤爲特出、</p>
<p>伍博士末謂、中英兩國、頗有相同之特性、均有光榮之歷史、富於保守性及進取精神、有商業上之團結力、并善待異國民族、（例如中國爲僅有之國家、未曾驅逐猶太人、實行將其　化）、是以兩國實有相同之點、并庭有切實之聯絡、取比之長、補彼之短、最後引前英使　浦森在北平餞别席上之言曰、「中英兩大民族相同之點甚多、均富於基本常識、并有敏慧之調和能力、對於一國有益者、亦必利於其他一國、甚望因此能有更進一步之諒解也」、</p>

<p>曁南前曾兩戰活塞斯、賴將士用命、幸均以一比一和局告終、昨日爲施高塔盃之第二次見面、活隊技藝日有進步、昨戰全局緊張、脚頭亦非常爽利、上午時卽以二對一佔先、下午時將終了時、竟一鼓作氣、接連搗入三球、曁南前鋒祇見亞輝一人、尚見活躍、中衞小雲亦頗稱職、顧尚勷徐亨功遇相抵、無大得失、</p>
<p>初上塲一去一來　列陣之後、激戰開始、雙方卽取絶對之攻勢、故沙塲之上、人影紛亂、馬足奔騰、活隊五前鋒數度窺門、俱爲徐亨擋駕、雪巴特得球北下、閥過中衞線、勾送中央、落點極妙、徐亨一撲落空、康姆登一撥入門、曁南乃以全力反攻、蔡令才盤過三關、傳交左翼王南珍、愛格頓趕到、王卽忙傳中、亞輝猛射一記、球擦横木直竄網底、乃成秋色平分、</p>
<p>徐亨大意失一球　造成和局之後、活塞斯聲勢又盛、阿巧帶球迫近低綫、葉綸言無奈逼成野球、阿巧主開、在門前落下、徐亨躍出人叢、捧球出險、亞輝率師反攻、一頂稍偏、已驚出赫巴特一身大汗、詎知活隊前鋒於大難不死之後、又起野心、五路齊下、黑炭弟頭陣沉殁、顧尚勷死力撑拒、康姆登得隙卽射、球勢不急、顧尚勷雖曾碰到球皮、但徐亨大意失手、空跌一交、由門左角徐徐滾入、嗟訝之聲、起於四野、</p>
<p>二十分光隂虚度　下午時開塲後、活塞斯暫取守勢、養精蓄銳、曁南鐵騎、横衝直撞、始終不能闖過三關、愛格頓陶樂威一虎一豹、見人卽噬、嚇巴特亦見陸精、徐亞輝數度興師、俱被史密斯半路刦回、瓊斯忙襄偷閑、也曾在南垓呐喊、爲小雲驅逐出境、雪巴特捲土重來、小雲復以其人之道、還治其人之身、數次忠勇勤王、頗博球迷好感、</p>
<p>一刹那三球連失　禍患之來、每爲人所意料不及、此時曁南滿擬扳轉一球、造成和局、但活隊之猙獰面目、至此忽然顯露、瓊斯得茂林之助、在二十碼外力射、斜飛入網、不旋踵、茂林又來發難、造成四一局面、阿巧意猶未足、再以五對一佔絶對上風、反顧曁南諸將、精神渙散、無力反攻、無何暮色蒼茫、茄聲一起、兩隊卽告收兵矣、</p>

<h3 id="c192">力的表現 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 伯元</p>
<p>記得我們文壇上曾經出現過一個名詞：「力的文學」。</p>
<p>詳細解釋並没有，然推其意，當係謂文藝作品者不伹題材應爲鬥爭的，而文字亦須有刺激性。所謂「尖銳」，所謂「積極」，所謂「富於革命情緒」，光景就是所謂「力的文學」的形容詞。</p>
<p>文藝作品本以感動人爲使命。然而感人的力量並不在文字表面上的「劍拔弩張」。譬如酒、有上口極猛的，也有上口温醇的。上口極猛者，當時若甚有「力」，可是後來亦不過如此。上口温醇者，則不然：喝時不覺得它的「力」，過後發作起來，眞正醉得死人！</p>
<p>眞眞有力的文藝作品應該是上口温醇的酒。題材只是平易的故事，然而藴含着充實的内容：是從不知不覺中去感動了人，去教訓了人。文字只是流利顯明，没有「驚人之筆」，也没有轉彎抺角的結構，然而給了讀者很深而且持久的印象。</p>
<p>這樣作品的產生是有條件的，即是豐富的生活經騐和眞摯深湛的感情。</p>
<p>伹並不是說上口極猛的文藝作品就要不得。不過作家應該不以「上口猛」爲滿足。</p>
<p>中國現在不乏咄咄逼人的作品，然而温醇的愈咀嚼愈有力的作品，還是少見。這原因也許是中國新文學倒底還没脫離「青年時代」。一個民族一個時代的文學有時也和個人相彷，（青年時代）雖然光彩驚人，却是要到「火候成熟」的程度，就必須走過長長的艱辛的創作經騐的道路。</p>
<h3 id="c193">論抱屁股 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 高植</p>
<p>林語堂先生論「踢屁股」一文，旣博且精，「踢屁股」確是中國的國粹之一。可是在中國抱屁股也是國粹之一，其爲國粹之某點意義，正如國醫國學等一樣，不是全體小民所可利用的。</p>
<p>這些抱屁股的人也就是「願意」把屁股給人踢的人。</p>
<p>爲什麽要抱屁肥呢？在我看來大概是這樣：</p>
<p>俗語中有句話呌作「一步登天」。登天的人是有的，他们用什麽方法登天這里且为提。可是不能誰都一步登天，這是事實。</p>
<p>但希望一步登天者却大有人在，他們甚至於雖明知不能登天却希望能夠升得高一點，懸在空中，把脚踏在人頭上。</p>
<p>希望登天而不能登天的人這麽多，自然要想特别辦法。</p>
<p>這特别辦法便是去找能夠登天的人，抱住他的屁股或大腿，把臉貼着被抱者的腰或屁股，一方面抱屁股者臉上的熱氣可以增加登天者的勁，登天者脚可以自由地踢着抱者的屁股，便是這樣的，想登天而不能者也隨人升上天空去了他們旣登天之後，在天空放屁也好，撒溺也好，下面的看衆却都像看風筝升天般的看他們在上面玩，快樂，放屁，從荷包中拿出元寳糖自由地吃着咬着，高興時就吐一點渣滓。</p>
<p>要找古法來說便是寵臣抱君的屁股，大臣抱寵宦的屁股，刺史抱大臣的屁股，縣守抱刺史的屁肥，皂隸抱縣守的屁股，甚至丫環奴婢也抱皂隸的屁股。但在平等親戚之間却不妨抱腰。</p>
<p>登天的人被抱屁股，抱者又被人抱屁股，故結果能登天者不能登得很高，抱屁股者的脚往往在空中踢到下面人的臉。至於被抱的屁股，則也有國貨，洋貨之别。</p>
<h3 id="c194">擺渡的 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>

<p>風如果不斷的吹，那倒也罷了；可怕的是呼的一陣，停一歇，又是呼的一陣，彷彿害寒熱病似的，就是你不冷也要戰慄。</p>
<p>江水深碧，風括過，倒處就起了白浪。從那白浪表，箭似的射出寒光。江面很寂寥，義雙龐大的帆船，全闃無人聲，載柴載洋油的木筏也很少經過；所以這隻渡船獨來獨往的横斷中流，眞是十分孤單的。</p>
<p>擺渡的是個老人，穿一身舊軍衣，赤脚，却很古性的裏着綁腿。他秃頭，鼻涕掛在稀疏的鬍子上面，如果流進嘴巴他就忙着舐。看他的瘦臉，聽他的啞聲，誰信他能摇船呢？</p>
<p>「擺渡的，快摇船過」來！</p>
<p>他本來蹲在船頭，或者躱在船艙裏偷聞吸筒旱烟，聽到這喊聲聲，就不得不把剩下的半筒烟丢在那裏，儘快的拔起竹槓，順着水，把船摇到對岸去，天這樣冷，如果他耽誤一刻，那末站在對岸沙灘上，在北風中等得急了的過路客，一定會咒死屍一樣的咒他：</p>
<p>「死了嗎？這半天還不過來！」</p>
<p>風實在列酷，每呼的一聲，他就得全身一縮，抖個不住。有時渡船顚簸了起來，彷彿會跟着水勢飄走似的，愈划反而離岸愈逺了。那根他平日用得熟透了的竹槓、也像驟然生疏了一樣，他那凍彊的手竟拿它不穩，好幾次差點掉進水裏。</p>
<p>看到他那可憐的樣子，許多人喃喃的說：「眞是死東西，看他那裏會摇船，我想還是坐在家裏吃老米飯吧。」</p>
<p>有的却說：</p>
<p>「不知是他在摇船，還是船在摇他！」</p>
<p>可是在這紛紛的責難中，船終於給他摇到岸了。因爲小埠頭壞掉，不能架跳板，那段泥濘見底的淺水，穿鞋襪的人簡直不能下脚：要從沙灘走到渡船上，除了背就没有别的辦法，這苦役自然又是他的份兒。</p>
<p>「水眞冷，簡直像冰一樣的刺骨，我們窮人……」</p>
<p>他彎着背，喘氣，不時怯生生的這樣說，而且回頭偷看他背上的人，想得點酒資，可是誰也没有理會他，誰也不肯給一個小錢。</p>
<p>看看岸上再没有人了，他又掙扎着拔起竹槓，迎着風，在黑黯而且隂森的天宇下，一寸一寸的把船摇了回去。</p>
<p>「今天眞冷得厲害，大概要落雪了吧？」</p>
<p>在半遂忽然有人這樣問。</p>
<p>「我的手指部像落掉了」。</p>
<p>誰馬上嘆着冷氣回答。</p>
<p>「老頭子，水屬特别冷，你成天摇船不冷嗎」</p>
<p>擺渡的只摇摇頭，没有回答，這問諾眞是無聊。他一固蹙眉鬱臉的望着逺山，望着荒野，一面全身發抖的摇着渡船，誰也不明白他正想着什麽。</p>
<p>在他這樣來回不斷的擺渡中，一天悄悄的過去，很快的就是黄昏了。</p>
<p>白天他雖則孤獨，却總算還有幾個渡客，聽得到一點人的聲音。可是在晚上，在這寂寞荒凉的江面，只乘他一人獨宿在機葉篷裏。</p>
<p>「擺渡的，快摇船過來！」</p>
<p>在夢中，這不安的老頭子也會被這喊聲驚醒，以爲那個挑年貨或者走夜路的人，正在對岸等着他；但探出頭去一看，他只見到一片寒冷的，夜的深淵。</p>
<h3 id="c195">賽珍珠的「新路」 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>賽珍珠的作品，到今日我還很少拜讀過。他的「大地」據說是一部描寫農民生活的小說，並且是很成功的。不過，我現在譚的却是他的一個短篇，「新路。」</p>
<p>關於文學校術上的話，因爲作者是個已成名的人，又據說「在國外早有定評」，我不想談牠。這一點，　在這　篇中，也確量很成功的。</p>
<p>現在且來談「新路」的意識罷。</p>
<p>「新路」中明明暗示的是兩個時代。一個是人家到老虎灶買水的時代己經過去了，接着來的是换了「自來熱水管」的時代。一些「小車，黄包車，驢子擠來擠去的，千年以上建築的那狹獈彎曲的小街的時代過去了，現在到了正在建造一條「邈逺米茫的」「怕世界上的人統統走到這里來也不會擁擠的」新路的時代。　　「現在是革命的時世了」。</p>
<p>「現在是忤逆兒子的時世，是懶蟲的時世，」他畫出屠格揑夫父與子中同樣兩世代的人物。</p>
<p>父親的時代到底過去了，陸順雖然固執的坐在老虎灶的廢墟上，看人家去拆屋上的瓦，「一任正午的太陽灼着，」結果，也拗不過兒子的再三請求，祇得「站了起來，好像已經非常老了似的，攙着兒子的手，跟着他去。」</p>
<p>接着來的時代是什麽？是一部分小車，驢車，老虎灶不見了，新路上有的目然是電車，汽車，高入雲霄的洋樓，與洋樓的主人，同時北門口外，附近田野的空地上多　了了一　小小的草棚，不如老虎灶的草棚，與往草棚的人。</p>
<p>老子雖然迷懸着過去，可是兒子是滿足現在的。因爲他從「這新路每月可拿五十塊錢，」所以他得意洋洋地答他父親道：「新政府允許給我的。」他很以一個監工而滿足。自然，他不能意識到，大家都不要住草棚子，都要享受「有自來熱水」裝置的高樓巨厦。新路的建築，不要再有「一片的哭泣聲」，也更用不着那樣威風凛凛的軍官和「三個兵」。</p>
<p>總之：這篇作品的意識是不夠的。作者暗示的時代，在歐洲早於一二百年就過去了。在中國雖然已開始在三十多年前到現在也還未完成其過程，可是這條新路却不能再按照舊的軌跡繼續開闢。牠必然要起一個飛躍，達到另一前途了自然，作者不能意識到這深刻，這是爲作者的社會層所决定的，不足爲怪。好的弱點也就因此被透露出來，她不能抓住中國現階段的實踐。</p>
<p>「這條新路是通到那兒去的呢？」隨着作者所暗示的方向，我們祇聽見「我們没命了，没命了喲」的一片的哭泣聲。</p>
<h3 id="c196">兩兄弟（四十五） <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>他尋思了一下，但什麽都想不起來。可是他一定没有看得仔細，没有觀察得準確，因爲他那時並没有什麽理由去發現這離於看出來的徵候啊。</p>
<p>他站起身頂備回到自己的房間去，他慢慢地走上扶梯，心裏還在想着。當經過他弟弟的房門口時，他忽爾停住了，伸出手開門。他突然有了一個强烈的欲望，要馬上去看哲安，要把他長久地看着，要出其不意地當他睡着的時候去看他，當他的疲倦緩和了，面上的紋路弛鬆且休息着的時候，當一切生的醜態都已消失了的時候去看他。這樣，他便可以抓到他面貌的睡時的秘密；如果有什麽值得注意的相似的地方存在着，那一定不能逃過他的眼睛。</p>
<p>可是如果哲安醒來了，他怎麽說呢？他怎樣解說他去看的原因呢？</p>
<p>他站着不動，手指緊握着門上的鎖柄，在思索一個理由，一個口實。</p>
<p>他突然記起八天以前，曾把一瓶醫牙痛的鴉片藥酒（Ｌaudanum）借給他弟弟。他可以說他今晚自己也牙痛，去取回他的藥水。於是他走進去了。但像扒手似的，偷偷地走着。</p>
<p>哲安半開了嘴唇，像一隻畜牲一樣酣睡着。他那金黄色的鬍子和頭髮在白色的被單上染上一個金色的污點。他毫没有醒，可是他停住不打鼾了。</p>
<p>筆爾彎下身子。貪婪地看着他。不，在他面前的這青年並不像羅蘭；於是他重又記起了那遺失了的瑪賴沙的小肖像。他非找出這肖像不行！看着那肖像，他或者不致再懷疑了罷。</p>
<p>他的弟弟動了，這一定因爲他站在面前，或是蠟燭的光透進了眼簾使他睡得不安的緣故。於是醫生往後退；用脚尖頂着走到門口，悄没聲兒地把門關了；隨後他便回到了自己的房裡，可是他並不睡下。</p>
<p>天亮得狠慢。飯廳裡的掛鐘一下一下地敲着，那聲音深沉而又嚴肅，彷彿這鐘表廠製出的小機件裏藏着有一口大教堂的鐘似的。這響聲傳上空虚的樓梯，穿過牆和門，消失在房間裡睡着的人的遲鈍的耳裡。筆爾在他的床和窗户之間來回地走着。他幹甚麽好呢？他覺得他心裡太騷亂了，今天這一天不能消磨在他的家庭裡。他希望至少還能够和衆人隔離一天。好讓他反省，讓他寗靜下來，讓他振作精神應付那必需回復的日常生活。</p>
<p>得啦！他可以到特洛威爾去，去看君衆在海濱騷動。這可以排除他的愁悶，變換他的思想，使他有時間準備應付他所發現的可怕的事情。</p>
<p>天一亮，他便洗　，穿衣。霧已消去，天氣狠好。因爲到特洛威爾去的船要九點鐘才離開埠頭，醫生便想他該在動身之前抱吻他的母親。</p>
<p>他等到了他每天起床的時候，便走下樓去。當走到他房門口時。他心跳得那樣勵害，不得不止了步呼吸着。他那擱在鎖上的手柔弱且顫動，他幾乎連旋轉鎖柄走進房去的一點力氣都没有了。他敲着門。他母親的聲音問道：</p>
<p>「誰呀？」</p>
<p>「我，筆爾。」</p>
<p>「你有什麽事？」</p>
<p>「因爲我要同幾個朋友到特洛威兩去頑一天，所以先來和你請安。」</p>
<p>「可是我還没有起床呢。」</p>
<p>「好，那你不要起來。我今晚回來的時候再抱吻你。」</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>時勢足以造英雄，英雄亦足以造時勢；但就電信界經騐所得，時勢兩字，實能產生多景的電報，故謂時勢造電報，亦無不可。</p>
<p>時局平靖，社會安謐，官軍電之往來，比較清减。迨政事忽生變化，時勢頓起緊張，於是疏通者疏通，聲討者聲討，詢問者詢問，報告者報告。電報業務上，隨之增加；電報線路上，隨之擁擠。此種現旬，允爲時勢所造成。</p>
<p>電信界人士，爲國家服務，爲社會服務，電報繁忙，職所應盡，且亦義無反顧；但旺衡現狀，國内上下，方精誠團結之不遑，乃時勢之變，出入意表。吾人覩電報紛飛，聆電機軋軋，此中工作，澈夜不停，一方固在努力戰守，同時當亦恍聞呼籲和平之聲也。</p>
<h3 id="c198">新舊國際電報規則對於明密語規定之比較王運楨 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>電報爲國際通信之鎖鑰，同時爲文化溝通之工具，必使世界人士，皆能充分利用電報，然後業務始能達。但欲達到此目的，須有兩個前提焉：（一）即電報文字，不受何種限制，凡參加國際電報公會之國，均得用各該國文字發電，（二）即電文組合，應求簡單化，一律化，以便計算字數，並便於傳遞是也。歷年各國電報專家，均注意及此。每届國際電報會議，對於業務規則條文，均有增修之處。蓋以世界電信交通，日趨繁複，業務規則，非隨時修訂，不足以資適用也。</p>
<p>查國際電報業務規則，現令沿用者，係一九二五年巴黎及一九二八年比京修訂者。去年（一九三二年）國際電報大會，開會於西京馬得里，是項規則修訂之處甚多。交通部已將原書譯成中文，不久即可付印出版。兹將新舊規則對於明語密語電報規定不同之點，擇要說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）舊規則内准予通用文字，以德文，英文，西班牙文，法文，荷蘭文，意大利文，葡萄牙文，拉丁文，世界語爲限。（中國文用四個數目字組成，亦准通用。）</p>
<p>新規則内通用文字，除右列九種之外，尚有亞比西尼亞語Ａbyssinian亞非利加語Ａfrican等，共五十六種。（中國文仍舊通用。）</p>
<p>（二）舊規則内明語可用ＡＡＡＮＯＵ等字母，及支點記號（；）感嘆記號　　（一）述語前後之記號。（；）</p>
<p>（三）舊規則准用十字暗語，惟字母之拚綴，有一定限制。計字非常困難，且因十字組合過多，傳遞時容易錯誤。</p>
<p>新規則内廢除十字暗語，祇准用五字暗語，且不受任何限制，計字旣易，傳遞時亦可減少錯誤。</p>
<p>（四）舊規則内五字暗語電報，以四個字起碼，報費照全價三分之二收費。新規則内五字暗語電報，以五個字起碼，報費照全價十分之六收費。</p>
<p>（五）舊規則五字暗語電報，所含數目字，（用文字表出者，不在内。）除係表明商標或商業標識者外，不得混用。</p>
<p>新規則暗語電報内准用數目字或成組之數目字。惟不得超過全電收費字數之半。</p>
<p>觀於新規則之規定，明語電報，開放有五十六國文字之多，暗語電報，僅適用五字暗語一種。前者爲求電報文字普遍化，後者爲求電報暗語簡單化，均較舊規則，大爲改進。世界人士，當樂爲之用。我國爲國際電報公會會員國之一，新規則内改訂各條，均定於明年（民國二十三年）一月一日起實行，國人應注意及之。聞國際電信局己有公函通知矣。</p>
<h3 id="c199">一年來電報業務之改進（中） <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 劉駿祥</p>
<p>（四）用市内電話收發電報按照該項辦法，凡電話用户，得向當地電報局臺，聲請將他處發來之電報，由電話傳送，或將發往他處之電報，由電話傳交局臺拍發，祗須繳納註册費一元，即可有效一年。其電報旣經電話傳送後，仍於當日將報底送交對方，以便稽對。此種辦法，對於電報之傳遞，得有更大之速度。</p>
<p>（五）電話號碼代替收報人住址，查收報人之住址，於電文内容無關，而每多文字冗長，按字計費，殊不經濟。交通</p>
<p>部訂定電話號碼代替收報人住址辦法一種，凡收報人裝有電話者，均得以電話號碼代替其住址，於號碼前加一話字，以資識别。其號碼不論幾個，概作一字計費。對於發報者殊爲節省，，上述第四種辦法，蓋同爲報話之聯絡利用也。</p>
<p>（六）改訂專力費辦法查電報收發辦法，原規定凡收報人住址距離局臺五里以外者，酌收專力費，惟現在各處市内道路，多已改良，若一逾五里，即收專力費，殊難得改報人之滿意，而報差又每多籍口需索，於局臺之信譽，不無影響。兹交通部有將　辦法加以改訂，凡收報人住址，局臺在同一城市之内者，不論距離若干，概不收取專力費。如不在同一城市之内，而距離又逾五里以上者，始得酌予收取。此種改訂，在局臺方面，係一種損失：在收報人方面，即係一種節省矣。</p>
<p>（七）華文電報得夾用阿拉伯數字華文電報，因技術關係，必須譯成電碼，始得傳達，故住址内之門牌號數，及電文内之銀錢數目，貨品數量，向章均須用文字書寫，不得用河拉伯字表示，以免，電碼混淆。此種規定，所需字數頗多。兹交通部巳准援照洋文電報辦法，關於上項門牌號數及各種數目，均得用</p>

<p>— 禾水</p>
<p>（乙）防止外人不利宣傳。</p>
<p>以前收發權未收回時，一切來往電報，均由三水線公司自行接收投送，我方未總絲毫顧問，因此在華外人可任意向外國各處報告不利於我之消息，我方無法部以阻止，結果各國人士，惑於此項宣傳，不明我國眞實情形，遂致對我發生種種不良之印象。今收發電報之權，業巳操自我方，各項電報均須經我之手，可以嚴密檢查，上述不利我國之情事，自可不再發生矣。</p>
<p>（丙）明瞭水線電報辦理情形。</p>
<p>收發水線電報事務，以前旣由各公司辦理，故其一切情形，無從知悉。今則來去全部電報，均經我方辦理，則業務狀况，自可明瞭。且以前各公司因求營業發達及爭攬報務起見，辦理報務，每有不合國際電報業務章程之處。現在收發電報，旣由我方辦理，自可逐漸改正，期，章程符合。收回三水線公司電報收發權之重要怠義，已如前述。目下上海各界人士，對於此事，究應有若何之認識乎？舉其大者，有左列各項：</p>
<p>（甲）應認識三收發處之正當名稱。</p>
<p>自本年五月一日起，在上海接收經三公司水線發往外國各處電報之機關，巳爲「交通部關際電信局大東，大北，太平洋水線電報收發處」，而非以前所稱之大東，大北，太平洋三水線電報公司。其投送外國各處發來電報之報差，亦爲上述三收發處之報差，而非以前三公司之報差。隸屬旣更，名稱已改，故上海各界人士以後爲尊重我國主權，並表示愛國思想起見，應深刻認「旘交通部國際電信局大東，大北，太平洋水線電報處」之名稱，而不必再於腦海中深印以前大東，大北，太平洋三公司之名義也。</p>
<p>（乙）應認識三收發處組織性質。</p>
<p>三收發處之全體職員差役，均係由交通部委派僱用，與以前三水線公司毫無關係。因此上海各界人士應切實明瞭三收發處爲交通　部管轄之機關，其地位實，兩京路沙遜大樓内國際電臺，四川路交通部電報局，及民國路無線電臺完全相同，而並非外國人主持之機關也。</p>
<p>（丙）應認識現在接洽報務手續。</p>
<p>目下大東，大北，太平洋三水線電報公司，並無對外接洽處理報務之權。所有關於水線電報之接收，投送，及詢問等事務，均應由三收發處直接辦理。嗣後各界人士如有關於來去水線電報之事務，均應打電話或寫信至三收發處接洽，而不必再沿用大東，大北，１太平洋三公司名義，以免發生種種誤會，延欄重要事務。查數月以來，外界對於此種情形，尚不甚明瞭，放仍多誤用公司名義，與三收發處接洽各各，此於辦事方面，實多妨碍，而於各界人士本身，尤有不利。深望上海各界人士，切實注意此點，以改正前述之錯誤。</p>
<p>現在我國各種事業，均力求改革進展。其以前被外人攫去之權利，亦漸設法收回。此次各水線公司等直接收發電報權之取消，及三水線電報收發處之組成，亦循此步驟進行。所望上海各界人士深刻認識三收發處現在之地位及情形·共同保持我國電信主權之完整，此實不僅電政之幸，抑亦國家之光也。至三收發處辦事人員方面，自當按照章程，努力辦理，最低限度，須維持以前公司時代之效事，進一步更當力求種種之改善，藉盡爲公衆服務之天職，而副各方殷殷之厚望也。</p>

<p>無線電發明家馬可尼ＧuglicimoＭarconi之聲名，一如無線電之傳佈全球，幾乎婦孺皆知。本年美國支加哥所開百年進步萬國博覽會，公定十月二日，爲馬可尼日。是日馬氏在會表演，並發送Ｓ信號，傳佈全球，費時約一分鐘，己回至原處。此Ｓ信號，蓋即一九零一年杪，馬氏在英國撲爾都越大西洋與紐芬蘭通信之符號也。</p>

<p>今馬氏居然逺涉重洋，來華遊歷。我國無線事業，雖屬幼稚，但歷經交通當局及我國專家之計畫經營，國際逺程通　信，至今已粗具規模，得先進而指導焉，則事業發展，更有厚望。我電信界人士，聆此消息，敬掬十二分之誠意，以歡迎無線電發明家丨馬可尼丨</p>

<h3 id="c202">電信叢談電話丨自動觀　撥動號碼盤　先充司機生 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>電話名爲「自動」，但機械本身，實非自動，一切仍須聽命於人，發爲動作；故「自動」兩字，乃用户自己動手接續之謂，所以别於普通使用電話之需司機生也。</p>
<p>通力合作</p>
<p>電話不用司機生，故司機之職務，一轉移而由用户自任。當耳機在握，指尖兒揷入號盤中旋動，往復輪廻，圓轉如意，此數少鐘間，用户非用户也，實係一電話司機生。迨談吐可聞，語言已達，耳機輕放，人亦他離，此一刹那間，用户非用户也，亦係一電話司機生（因話機放上後，話局内部之相關機件，立刻恢復常態，不啻司機生之拆線）。</p>
<p>用户旣兼充司機生，則如何司機？如何接達？諒爲閱者所欲知（此係對於一般用户知使用而未知機械情形者而言）。兹先就話機上之號碼盤，加以簡單之說明。</p>
<p>在使用電話之初，提取耳機，此時用户之線，巳接達話局，聞得嗡嗡之聲。嗡嗡云者，在電話術語上，稱爲「達而通」ＤialＴono旣「達而通」矣，自可依號接續，於是放心轉盤（如無嗡嗡之聲，意即不獲「達而通」，係線路阻斷，或無空線之故）。</p>
<p>盤之外表，與其内容，如附圖所示，習用者殆無不一見即識。盤之内部主要者爲一能伸放之彈簧，因其回轉之力，使連帶而動之電氣關鍵，開閉電流。此種電流，如人身之脈搏，其次數與所轉之號數相同，其遲速則由内部轉輪司之，每次號盤轉動，到達極限，手指一離，盤亦回旋，斯時脈搏電流，續續波動，通入話局裝置，由機械之動作，以完成雙方接線之手續。如此，則用户非司機生乎？用户固司機生也。</p>
<p>用户兼充司機生，在社會使用上着想，頗有利益。一則自己動手接續，祇須號碼撥凖，所喚之用户，不在通話，無有不能正確接通者：二則在五方雜處，言語不同之地方，由司機生接線，常有因所報號碼誤聽，以致錯接，或則被喚之户正忙，而用户不明以爲司機生之有意延擱，皆能直接明瞭，無煩解釋（機械方面之利益，兹姑不談）。此所以首都電話局，自裝置自動話機以來，使用者極感便利，而交部所辦之電話，如滬漢等地，亦皆除舊更新，有自動電話之改裝也（局内機械情形，下期再談）。</p>

<p>Z&gt;清華</p>
<p>（一）收報人查問電報須知</p>
<p>三·電報未曾送達收報人如接到發報人通知，某日有來電一次，而電局並未送到，可先向電報局詢問，某日有否來電，如該局並未收到，則該電必被中間局漏轉，或發報局漏發，應通知發報人持原電收據，向發報局查問。如查問結果，確係電局漏發漏轉或漏送，則該電報費可由發報人向發報局請求全數退還。</p>
<p>四·電報遲延　收報人接到來電，如發覺收到過遲，（來電紙上端日期及時刻欄内所註，係發報人交發來電之日期及時刻可與收到之時刻一對，即知曾否延擱。至稽延之時間除國外來報另有規定外國内來報，普通以不得遍於郵遞爲率。可持來電向電報局查問遲延原因。如因線路發生障礙，或報務擁擠，或被軍事檢查員壓擱，以致遲延者，該電報費不能退還。如因電局業務上之疏失而延擱者，可將來電寄交發報人向發報局請求退還報費。</p>
<p>五·詢問發報人姓名　收報人接到來電，有時因無發報人署名，以致不知係由何人發來，可持來電至電報局，請求發寄納費公電查問發報人姓名。此項納費公電，除去電應付六字報費外，尚應預付回電四字或五字之報費。兹爲明瞭計算報費起見，特將來去納費公電舉例如下：</p>
<p>（一）納費公電去電計六字</p>
<p>＝Ｒcx=　645　Ｓixteenth　Ｓmith　ＳenderssＮamc</p>
<p>納費標識即　來電號數　來電日期　來電收報人姓名　請查示發報人姓名預付若干回電費</p>
<p>（二）納費公電回電計四字</p>
<p>Ｉ26　Ｓeventeenth　Ｓrrith　Ｊohn</p>
<p>去電號數　去電日期　原電收報人姓名　原電發報人姓名</p>
<p>六·查詢發報局名錯誤　來電紙上端「發報局名」欄内所書之洋文地名，即係本電自該處發來。此項地名，有時或被電報局傳遞錯誤，如滄州誤爲滄口，則收報人接到來電時，將疑發報人已改赴某處爲愼重起見，可持來電至電報局，用納費公電查問發報局名。如查問結果，確係電報局之錯誤，則預付之納費公電來去報費，均可如數退還。如並無錯誤，則報費不能退還。　　七·請將來電轉遞他處　收報人有時預知某處將有來電，但臨時因緊急要事須赴他處，爲免來電無法投遞，或延擱起見，可備函向電報局聲請將本人來電轉遞至將往之某處，惟須證明確係本人？（以免他人冒收來電），並担任此項轉遞電報之報費。</p>
<p>八·電報投送錯誤　電報有時因收報人在住址不明，或商行名稱類似，或電局信差疏忽，以致投送錯誤。凡收電者發覺該電並非寄，本人者，應立即送還電報局，或用電話通知電報局派差取回，以便立時改送，切勿逕自轉送，以免發生誤會。</p>
<p>九·電報日期錯誤　收報人接到來電，如疑原電發出日期似有錯誤，或因電文，原電日期有關，（如明日動身等語），爲愼重起見，均可持來電至電報局發寄納費公電查問。如查問結果確係電局錯誤，則納費公電之報費可以如數退還。</p>
<p>十·來報漏譯　來電照章應由電局將電碼譯成文字，如有漏譯或需索譯費情事可將來電寄交南京交通部電政司，請予查明將該電局負責人員加以懲處。</p>
<p>十一·發寄預付回報辦法　來電之收報地名或人名之前，如有預付回報費之業務標識字樣ＲＰＸ（即預付回報費若干），收報局在投送該電時，即附送預付回報費憑單一紙，收報人可持此憑單向電報局發寄回電。回電應收之報費如超過預付之數時，應由發寄回電人補足。如不及預付之數時，可請電局出一便條，書明尚有若干報費未經使用，收報人可將比條寄交發報人向發報局請求退還。（未經使用之數，在國内報費低於銀元四角，國際報費低於二金法郎者，不能退還）。</p>
<p>分送份數，本地爲三００，外地爲七００，則總計應納三０九馬克六六分尼，平均每份約費二六分尼（約合中幣三角）。</p>
<p>商人耗此區區之數，得電報力量之助，可决斷其應用廣告之目的必能達到</p>
<p>，蓋尋常廣告印制品，可由外表一望而知，得者每多塞諸字簍，若用上述方法，則收報人接到來電，固未有不展開一讀者也。</p>

<p>國際電報新業務規則明年元旦日起實行　國際電報業務規則業經去年西京馬德里國際電報會議修改，其中開於電報收費者，如加急電均按尋常電二倍收費，己自本年四月一日起實行，尚有關於更改暗語電報辦法，則自明年元旦起實行。此項辦法極爲重要，兹摘要錄後，以便商民參考。</p>
<p>一·舊稱甲語暗語（即十個字母組成之暗說）取消。</p>
<p>二·暗語每字以五個字母爲限，其組成之法除重音字母不准用外，不受任何限制，即每字中母音字母有否隨便。</p>
<p>三·暗語電報照全價電報電費十分之六收費，（國内電仍照全價收費），每電至少以五字計算。</p>
<p>四·暗語電報内之收報人姓名住址及發報人署名，仍按每十五個字母作一字計算。</p>
<p>國語電報彙編初稿巳成正在審核中　交通部前爲推行國音電報起見，曾特派陳彝煜裘文炳二員編訂國語電報彙編，爲時數月，初稿現己竣事。惟交部爲愼重起見，日前又派陳彝煜將初稿携往北平，合同國語統一籌備委員會加以審核，以期完善。一俟審核完畢，即將凖備實行云。</p>
<p>水災區設立臨時電台　交通部最近爲便利黄河水災區爲通訊，以利救濟工作起見，特在開封蘭封長垣小龐莊等處設立電台，並派報務員多人分赴各該處工作云。</p>
<p>首都試辦電話收受電報　各大都市地面遼闊，電報局及無線電台雖有分局及收發處數處，但民衆發電，仍感跋涉之勞。最近交通部特仿照美國商辦電報公司辦法，訂定電話通知收報辦法一種，先飭南京電局及電台試辦，如試辯成續甚佳，並無穻礙，則再逐漸推行各大都市，如上海天津漢口北平等處，以便民衆。此項辦法内容係凡民衆發電，可用電話通知電局或電台，派員至其住處收取電報及電費，俾足不出户，即可將電報發出，且並不另加手續費云。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>靠山吃山，靠海吃海，所以三百六十行，古今上下，都會「偷工减料一的一手，而美其名曰，行行出狀元。</p>
<p>如今舉一個明顯通俗的例。譬如你要做一件長袍子，自然該請教成衣匠。於是成衣匠。於是成衣匠便得打你的後手。雖然你十分精明，一丈二尺半料子，要他做三尺九寸長的大袍，總以爲不會再被偷工减料了。可是成衣匠却會把你的一丈一尺五没命的燙成一丈三，剪下半尺，去賣给零剪店。若是炙手可熱的熨斗，也終於無衛回天，那麽，最低的限度，也得偷你三寸二寸做小孩子的鞋料。至於針線方面，自然是用的「揚漿主義」，雖然可以省做三針五針，也是好的，因爲可以節省三針五針的時間。</p>
<p>不過偷工儘可偷工。無論如何，總不能偷工到一寸三針，才上身，就裂開了一大段。减料儘可減料，也總不能减料到三尺九寸長的袍，只做三尺八，而給主顧抓住了胸襟，奉敬老大耳括子。自然，偷工减料，也得有個分寸兒，不能不顧利害，不忖前後。否則準會不只給人打碎老招牌，怕的會不再有一個主顧上門來。偷工减料得恰到好處的，才能夠名利雙收。</p>
<p>貓兒是没有不愛腥魚味兒的，黑眼珠子没有不對着白銀子迸火，所以不拘幹甚事業，撈些兒後手，天理人情，都没甚說不過去，因爲一清風兩袖，身後蕭條的，己是時代落伍者，不再有提倡的價值的了。不過話又得說回來，打後手也得做一些面子，遮遮世人眼。若是只求裏子，不求面子，玩一套。「宰相合肥天下瘦一那還夠不上算是偷工减料」的能手。</p>
<h3 id="c207">懷舊 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>壯年人的心情，是勇敢的，積極的，拚命的，向着未來追求的，因爲前途有了富於魔力的「希望」，在引誘他，在向他招手，他不能不向前呐喊，狂，希企趕上去，一把揪住了它丨希望：老年人巳經筋疲力盡，「希望」又把他抛在無垠的沙漠中而逺遁了，他於是感到寂寞，孤單，除玩味過去人生旅途中的斷片的比較有意義的生活外，還想什麽？還有什麽可求？然而年紀不老，有時，還可在少年隊伍中鬼混一場的我，却也心灰意冷，不求進取，而且厭惡現實　，玩味起早已消失了的過去來。</p>
<p>其實，過去那短短的平凡的生活歷程中，確也留下了些耐人尋味的印像，這些印像最深刻而使我感到永不能磨滅的，便要算童年在故鄉南巖讀書時候的一幕了，</p>
<p>南巖有八景，八景之中，以一滴泉，五級峯爲最擅勝，而開鑑塘，濯纓井次之，其餘四景，想因後人附會而得名，初到這地方的人，是摸不着頭腦的，這兒，是個穹窿的石室，其大可容數千人，巖洞口左邊石壁間，有個乳頭般的懸石，清泉終年不絶地滴下，這便是一滴泉；巖的石邊輕徐地伸出一支山脈，再折向巖前陡立，又分五個層次漸漸地高聳，這就是我所謂的五級峯，巖，是給左右的山峯團團地包圍住的，非到五級峯麓下，是絶對不見巖洞的，因爲宋朝朱晦菴，陸象山曾在這兒講過學，所以和廬山五老峯下的白鹿洞，同樣爭得一點歷史上的微名，</p>
<p>巖裏建造了兩座巍峨寛敞的棟宇，右邊一座是釋迦牟尼一類的佛殿，左便邊是朱文公祠，也就是我們的學校，因爲學校管理疎懈，讀書，玩耍，再也隨便不過；不高興上課了，便約同學們登五級峯，或者，垂釣開鑑塘；晚上，那晶瑩皎潔的月亮，斜照在蒼翠疏密的修竹，透入巖前的草庭上，猶如平湖水面的荇藻；我們坐着，站着，談笑着，表演着拳擊；有時，引吭高歌，山谷給我們候長的回響，鳥兒也給驚醒了啁啾地在應和，這些高傲的，愉快的，自然的生活，豈是囚居在充滿着緊張情緒的都市裏的人們所能想像的？</p>
<p>「希望」對於我，恰似溺者向水底追求光明和生路，越是追求的起勁，越是没有光明，越是死路一條，只有這過去的隻鱗片爪的渾然無我的生活，纔值得回味，纔算我的生命史上金光燦爛的一頁，今生可能再得？</p>

<h3 id="c212">飲食無自由 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>翱翔於天空中的這　駕駛飛機着，大多數是吸紙烟的，他們中有許多是「紙烟老槍一，吸得非常之多。這一點却是很危險，飛行界的權威者，曾指示我們說，吸紙烟是飛行家所能做的事務中，最最壞的一件，因爲吸了紙烟，他們的咽喉，常是乾燥的。一個飛機駕駛人，從極高的地方，迅速地下降的時候，厭力的突然改變是劇烈，很難堪的。這種情形，足以使他整個的頭部作怪，起一陣響，以致他變爲暈眩。免除這種不愉快的弊病，唯一的方法是繼續不斷地囒唾液，因爲囒的動作，可以使起自咽喉後面而通至耳膜的幾根管開放。所经</p>
<p>以英國的飛行訓練所的教練官，勸告一般的駕駛飛機者，要常嚼留蘭香糖（俗稱橡皮糖，西名ＣhewＧum），口爵留蘭香糖，可使咽喉時常潮濕，囒唾液也就容易了。留蘭香糖並不是一種必需的食物，但是飛行家爲避免危危險起見，不得不嚼。因此想起了一椿人家不甚注意的事實來了。</p>
<p>這事實便是飲食無自由。誰也知道人們的飲食有絶對的自由，其實不盡然，飲食和言論一樣的，在某種特殊情形之下，也不得完全自由的。譬如我們天天所吃的食品中，所含的滋養料要平均，要完備，蛋白質，炭水化物，脂肪，澱粉質，維他命等要素，缺一不可。假使缺了一樣要素，便要生一種難治的病症，這是在學理上證明飲食並不完全自由的。再從習慣上也可得到些證據，例如山東人頓頓要吃大蒜，四川人菜菜要加辣椒，安南人常嚼檳榔，蒙古人須吃乳酷等等。一旦把這些常吃的東西，禁止他們再吃，他們就要周身不舒服，甚至生起病來了。再有患病的人，一切飲食物品，都要經醫生的許可，方才可食，這是飲食絶對没有自由了。我國人民對於飲食物的色香味，非常講究，對於質量成分滋養，郤不太注意。所以除了在某種特殊情形之下以外，我國人民的飲食，可說是十分自由的；西方人民郤不然，有許多工廠和職業中，某種食品是認爲特别有價值，某種勞工必須有一種特别的食品，有的竟强迫喝「牛乳可可。何者有益丨飲食絶對自由的那，還是不完全自由的好，那是要請專家來斷定的了，我們不敢妄言。</p>
<p>某種食品對於某種職業是特别有價值的，這句話並非信口胡柴，確右證據的。例如住在英國西北部分的伐木爲業者，賴以生活的食品，大多數是猪肉與豆。這輩伐木爲業者，在嚴寒的氣候中，做非常勞苦的工作，他們用去的精力，一定要靠他們的食品來補償生長。所以他們吃猪肉與豆，因爲除此兩樣東西以外，没有一種混合食物，能夠生長更多的熱力和股肉來了。伐木爲業者，也吃多量的燒餅。這是一種在糖汁中悶煮的厚扁餅。這種糖汁在實騐上，含有純粹的糖，差不多是百分之一百的炭水化物；炭水化物郤是產生熱力的東西。用腦力來工作的人，要常吃白色魚（西名ＷhiteＦish）。照從前人想，白色魚是供給滋養腦部的燐的。這種見解是荒誕不足信，但是魚類對於須坐之職業，常坐的生活的人，非常適宜的，因爲魚類供給一和種滋養充足而質量頗多的肉質，西名ＢutchersＭeat，這種肉質，消化起來，旣快且易。用腦力來工作的人，應以魚類爲主要食品。</p>

<p>清客，本不是一種職業，然而在中國竟有以此爲職業的，過去的幕客，就是如此。這風氣的養成，大概在封建時代，一般没落的文人，進旣不能自立門户，作官作宰，退又不願伴着家中黄臉婆子，老死牖下，於是在冷板凳坐厭之餘，想一出頭之日，便不得不出於依傍門墻，充當清客的一途了。此輩生涯，惟有仰承主人意志，興風作浪，推波助瀾，以過其伴食生涯。在旁人看來，其境遇煞是堪憐，而此輩方欣欣自得，以此驕人哩，亦可見其品格了。</p>
<p>做清客的目的，旣是在凑他人趣，丨丨換言之，即爲供人消遣，其個性早已消失在環境之中，故對於任何事，俱不能獨往獨來，以顯出他是一個獨立生成的人。而惟順人指揮，以分取一點賸餘爲滿足。</p>
<p>但「凑趣」兩字，亦自難言，第一必須揣摩得他人個性；第二亦須少有才情，方能做到圓滑老當，八面玲瓏。否則是難免要馬屁拍上馬脚去的。</p>
<p>偶閱清梁章鉅的歸田瑣記，中有論清客一條，云云「都下清客最多，然亦須才品稍兼者，方能自立。有編爲十字令者，曰：「一筆好字，二等才情，三斤酒量，四季衣服，五子圍棋，六齣崑曲，七字歪詩，八張馬弔，九品銜頭，十分和氣。」寥寥數十字，活將一付清客臉譜畫出，洵可謂言簡意賅。特梁氏所論，係指當時的清客，故與今日情形稍有不同。倘欲畫現代清客的臉譜，則應改爲：「一張厚臉，二付面孔，三句口號，四季衣服，五張撲克，六齣平劇，七言文告，八圈馬將，九個委員，十分和氣。」而活動的範圍也隨着時代而稍廣。譬如一有事故，則發通電，散傳單，逢集會，則充代表，爭委員，要人來往，則手執小旗到碼頭上迎送；闊人或其老婆死了，則爲辦理喪事等等，不論任何雞毛狗碎的事，一入他們的手裏，俱能做得淋漓盡致，這都是過去的清客們所未曾幹過的新把戲。雖然宗旨還是麽一個掮招牌當轎夫的老法。</p>
<p>掮招牌，當轎夫的，也有肩痛脚酸的時候，但此輩朝斯夕斯，對於所務的事，却似乎津津有味，絲這不覺得無聊，眞可算爲異秉了。嗚呼，此其所以爲清客也歟？</p>

<p>望家書。兩眼穿。讀家書。兩涙流。老母閭望。游子未能歸。夢魂歸故鄉。投入慈母懷。問母何悲傷。兒亦淚常流。兒何久不歸。老母心未釋。歌場舞榭兒莫去。花街柳巷弗涉足。母己兩鬢白。不久入黄土。兒家巳有糟糠婦。野草閑花别貪圖。千斤仔肩巳屬爾。嗷嗷待哺有數口。而今母年已耄矣。從此家務責兒婦。兩父棄爾十餘載。長眠地下倒安樂。爲母含辛與茹苦。年青守寡只爲爾。兒須記母言。在客自愛護。奮志圖存向前進。人格毋爲他人污。仁義禮智信。牢記在心窩。爲國爲家男兒志。時時謹防入歧途。慈母勿悲切。爲兒遵母囑。在外日久歸不得。生活壓迫没奈何。背井離鄉一年餘。奔走栗碌像牛馬。兒媳閨中盼夫歸。兒亦在外自照顧。飲食冷暖誰調理。衣破襪碎自縫補。家書疊疊來。徒亂兒心緒。長言呶呶猶未休。黄梁夢寤已醒悟。兩且覺腫疼。枕上淚滂沱。</p>
<h3 id="c235">生死拉雜談 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>關於一個人生命的長短，我想是不值得大驚小怪的，生下地來就死去不見得可悲，活上一百歳也不見得怎樣可賀。一個純潔的靈魂降臨到這世界上來，除非你吃睡過一世猪般的生活，否則，祗要你是一個人，就有專爲人類而設的羅網請你去鑽，而一切煩惱，痛苦是永逺追隨在你的身畔。坐汽車的有坐汽車的煩惱，痛苦；拉黄包車的有拉黄包車的煩惱，痛苦。聚許多貧富貴賤不同職業不同身份的人類於一室，我想到這裏來研究人生哲學，倒是個好的教訓。</p>
<p>然而人對於生命總是那樣的寳貴，古語有「好死不如惡活」，黄浦灘邊上也立着「死少得的，回頭吧」的警句。喪事人家奏的細樂，往往是令人心酸，還有文人筆下的哀××悼××等文字，對於死都是表示十分凄凉。不過記得佛家說的，一個人生下地來，他的過程是生老病死，歸根結底，有了生就是死的開始·然則多活幾年少活幾年有什麽值得大驚小怪哩？</p>
<p>作者並没有多大的感觸，說下這許多不相干的話，因爲有一天到親戚人家去拜壽，發見了這生死兩相對照的事。我的親戚也並不「活」得使人驚奇，按照中國人的算法，他今天恰恰四十歳。雖然我聽見過老年人說現在的人不此從前了，都没有壽長的，然而一百零幾歳的道長也在大世界見過，無論他在廣告上特别誇大，總之比活四十歳的人，他總可以傲然自得了。我的親戚活了四十歳，對放這小小的紀錄，就大做起壽來，不過表示他臨降到這世界上來後，他的吃喝都可以不擔心事，這樣舒舒服服的活上四十歳，膝下生了兒子孫子，他的一生的任務差不多已經做完，於是以爲就是天大的喜事，大可以做做壽表示他的「活」四十歳，就是這樣的意義。</p>
<p>同時在我親戚的隔壁，死去了一個三歳的獨生子。中國人對於傳宗接代是一件天大天大的大事。一個人娶了妻子，生了兒子，他就可以對得起父母祖宗了。往往見了人家兒子多，總得一聲好福氣，如今一個單傳的三歳兒子死了，比起四十歳做壽的紀錄來，那又是膛乎其後了。哭，理應該哭，生下地來，過這末三年丨丨還是依照中國人的算法，恐怕二歳還没有足：而隔壁人家是在大鑼大鼓的告訴你也家有一個人已「活」了四十歳，說不定十年後，他還要敲一次告訴你四十歳的人巳變了五十歳。這樣的對照，對於多活幾年和少活幾年是值得大驚小怪了。</p>
<p>作者是個二十五歳的老青年，對於生死是不抱若何悲歡離合的，草這篇文字早聲明不是有感而發，所以希望做壽的親戚和死了三歳獨生子的家長不要見到這篇文字，作者僅是拉雜談談而已。</p>

<p>— 欲歸</p>
<p>都市通訊之一</p>
<p>老友：</p>
<p>要不是在樓那裏見到你的信封，我們不知要到什麽時候纔能知道我們别後三年的情况；雖然天涯何處不相逢，不信我們就此不能再見一面。</p>
<p>你的來信說，三年來你蟄居在鄉間巳經十足變成一個鄉下人了，老友　鄉下人，城裏人有什麽分别？天旣生我們這天一個人，一個人　有天　　　　，在這天賦的責任没有告卸之前，我們同具五官四肢的分什麽鄉下人和城裏人呢？而且在責任告卸之後，我們不是還這末一個臭皮囊？</p>
<p>你說：「所謂農村經濟破產，恐怕在都市紳士的頭腦中僅僅是四個字的影像罷了，農村確是在經濟破產時期，不過唱高調喊着到農村去有什麽用呢？農村中的經濟破產同樣像都市中的不景氣一般。幾百萬家當的富翁，無論不景氣到什麽地步，對於他是絲毫没有損失的，在農村中正是這般的現旬，富有幾千畝的大種田，他們的生活也是十分舒適，一切的剥削都降臨在租種田主幾畝或幾十畝的小佃農……」</p>
<p>眞是我們在都市中討生活的，對於農村是没有這般透視的認識。老友，你能靠着自己的腕力耕種自己的田地，如其我們没有學校時代的那種美夢，大概你還是幸福的，你安穩的做一個鄉下人罷。我們這一羣，在都市的壓迫中，想安穩的做一個如你所說的鄉下人，今生是没有這種幸福了。最近露失了業，老友，你知道嗎，上海的生活是這般的高，我們抓着一個三十元的飯碗，還是我搶你奪，眞如你說的一切的剥削都降臨在我們這批朝不保夕的朋友身上丨</p>
<p>露每天到我這裏來，我尚有那般紳士階級榨賸下來的殘羹冷飯捧捧，所以見到露的失業，想起我自己生活的保障也像空中游絲一般。最近我發表一篇棄文習武，很想把我們的長袍剥下來，做藍布短衫階級大概比我們的生活還可高上幾倍。不過，老友，在我們的週遭，是勢利的都市眼，我們的長袍始終在摇尾乞憐的狀態下維持着我們不得巳的尊嚴。老友，你願意來做一個城裏人嗎？</p>
<p>爲了你一句鄉下人，引起我不少牢　　想你也不樂爲接　　都市來的　　　　；不過你問起我們别後三年來的生活，眞是一部二十四史，一時從那裏說起，我想慢慢地再寫信給你吧。</p>
<p>前天和露合照了一張像，看看還像個人，送給你這鄉下人看看，或者要使你不認識了，三年的光隂使我們蒼老了許多，老友，這就是做城裏人的好處，如其你嫌你的身體太强壯，我在這裏歡迎你來嘗嘗城裏人的味道。</p>
<p>在慘淡的燈光下寫這封信，爲了日裏寫字太多的緣故，眼花錯亂起來了，我還想貪得這僅有所幾小時的睡眠，不然，明天的麵包或者要起變化，就此帶住罷，祝你終身做一個安穩的鄉下人。</p>

<p>— 孟逺</p>
<p>近幾天來，妻又有點不高興了！尤其是在晚上，躺在床上，想着他那副冷面的嘴臉，眞是使人感到了一陣莫名其妙的掃興。</p>
<p>這是很無趣味的事，在那不高興的時候；同時也是我握筆工作的開始。雖然很疲乏的身子，但却也不能不打起精神來研究她不高興的原因。</p>
<p>「你有什麽不舒服嗎？」我小心翼翼地問，但他不答，而且更不高興的現出了愁容。</p>
<p>這眞是天曉得的事，平空的不高興，問他一句也不回答：這樣的想着，自己心裏苦惱了起來。然而，生氣是不行的，我須忍耐，問他一個明白。</p>
<p>「寳貝丨究竟怎麽一回事？告訴我，告訴你親愛的傢伙吧！」我半獻殷誠，半開玩笑似的，逗她說出不高興的所以然來。</p>
<p>但，他反而「㗒」的一聲哭起來了！</p>
<p>這眞是要命了！我很生氣，想起了女人的愛哭，我眞恨透了！</p>
<p>「女人眞是賤東西！」我這時生了氣　覺得只有不理會她的時候，他才會安靜地生活起來。</p>
<p>「哼！是咧！女人是賤的？」她這時候却開口了！</p>

<p>「人家好好的勸你，問你，怎麽一聲不嚮地，理都不來理我呢？」</p>
<p>「你曉得人家是多們的苦哎哎！」</p>
<p>「你有什麽苦？不告訴人家，人家那理會知道你呢？」</p>
<p>「怎麽没有告訴過你呢？！」妻大聲的說，伴着哭音。</p>
<p>「明明白白地，你是一句話也没有說過。」</p>
<p>「你說没有說過，就算没有說過。」我開始從頭想了一遍，她確没有講過什麽？於是我祇好默不作聲地不去理她。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，這樣她却不哭了！不，而且還和我講話起來：</p>
<p>「二個月没有月經了！假使有了孩子，怎麽得了喲？！」</p>
<p>兩人的生活，都還得靠兩人的智力和勞働，來勉强維持；若再增加了一個孩子，不但破壞了我們前進的陣線，更還要來分散我們的精力，於是在有錢的人家裏爲一種喜訊，在我們這般窮光蛋，却成爲最憂悶的事了！</p>
<p>「可是，這不是應當苦悶的事，我們爲着社會而生，我們更不應該讓還没有完全改革的惡社會，來吞噬我們的丨也就是大家的孩子；我們應當快樂地把他生下來，加速地培育他成爲我們的後備隊。」</p>
<p>同時，妻也覺得這是婦女們的本能所不應逃避的一種工作；她破涕的笑了！可是好却用手指點了點我的額角說：</p>
<p>「快樂的是你，受苦的是我，你這人眞是害人不淺。」</p>
<p>她忍不地笑了！我本想乘機地打趣她一下；但是我的嘴，却被她的一隻手捫住了！</p>
<p>於是彼此一笑，她也解衣上床睡覺，我便摟着她，接了一個很長的吻。</p>

<h3 id="c238">關於「裸體」和「健美」的話 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 神</p>
<p>丨看了「性教育影片」回來丨</p>
<p>大報章上，和在德國讀書回來底的朋友們的談論中，知道裸體運動在德國巳經是一種時髦而普遍的玩意兒了。記得前不久，上海的時代姑娘和摩登少爺們也都在一陣陣地鬧着耍玩玩這時髦的把戲，一時間，新聞記者們的兩條尊腿就着實爲這壯了一向時，而社會上一部份要找尋新刺激的人也像發了狂般地在内心把慾火燃熾着，恨不得立刻就將身上披着的「蟬紗」「輕絲」之類的勞什子脫下來燒掉，或是扔到黄浦江裏。但，這是很夠時代姑娘和摩登少爺們掃興没趣的，還没有發動，就碰着了强硬的壁丨壁上是這樣大書特書着：你們這「違犯法律，「傷風敗俗」，「縱淫荒誕」，漁利歛錢」的無廉恥的狗東西！</p>
<p>自己亦是除了晚上在臥房裏上床舖睡覺，或是獨自關緊了門躱在浴間裏洗澡的時候，脫得亦　精光（註：裸體也）　　外，其餘吃飯，會客，上公事房，無論那一時候，都是着了整齊的衣冠，扮着「高等華人」的一員，所以，贊成給那般愛找尋新鮮刺激的摩登的人們一個强硬的壁碰碰，這當，然是毫無異議而不成問題的。並且，我還曾不自巳地這樣在腦經裏默想着：這個時髦玩意兒的倡導以及實行人，正是這個奇怪社會裏的「刺激的，飢渴者，」時代姑娘和摩登少爺丨他們原來有的是高等的衣，珍貴的冠，不過他們都穿戴得膩了，煩了，厭了，而感着奇特的沉悶：要打開這沉悶，當然是必須着這最最新鮮刺激的「裸體運動」了丨於是時代的摩登的姑娘少爺們的高帽子扔了，珍貴的褲子脫了……</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>因着這個默想，在那個時候，牽連地另外一個思潮就在我的心頭狂放地澎湃着，奔騰着，振擊得我底心感覺激劇的創痛：我們看吧，我們把視線從「姑娘」「少爺」之羣移到這個社會的另一個角落裏，看，那邊不是十八歳的大姑娘還没有褲子穿嗎？那邊那些皮黄飢瘦看得見骨頭的人們不巳經是成日成年的在那兒裸體」着了嗎？他們爲什嗎「裸體」着呢？是衣服穿膩了煩了厭了而在找尋新鮮的刺激嗎？是違犯法律，傷風敗俗，縱淫荒誕，漁利歛錢嗎？然而又爲什麽竟得寛恕他們，讓他們逍遥「法」外而不給他們一點强硬的壁碰碰呢？道裏，我們可以拿「天災」，命運」去爲他們解釋嗎？</p>
<p>所以，在這矛盾迷亂的社會，什麽事都有些盾矛面呌人難以分辨，所謂裸體運動，也是一樣的：說反對吧，的確這些哥兒們，有閒的玩意兒，是無需乎我們贊成的：但若說贊成吧，那又可以拿什麽理由去反對道「事實」造成的「裸體了」？</p>
<p>昨天在「上海」看了性教育影片「健美的女性」（該片是記述某國女性的合理的衛生和運動）回來，心裏發生了很多的感觸，第一點，它告訴我們：裸體的户外運動是能增進健美的（該影片裏所指的是偏於女性）。第二點，這個運動不只是幾個有閒的時代姑娘摩　少爺的找尋新鮮刺激的把戲。雖然，這些，究竟搬演到咱們這樣一個奇怪的國度裏來，多少找個人認爲是完完全全屬於「理想」的！因爲在事實上，我總忘不了，據說是由「天災」「命運」逼成的没有褲子穿的十八歳的大姑娘，和皮黄飢瘦看得見骨頭的成年裸體着慘號的一羣丨他們成年，幾乎是習慣了的裸體，爲什麽不「健美」一些呢？</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我對於貴報業餘信箱，很是佩服，我腦海裏屢想寫信請教先生，但恐字不像字，文不成文，難免慚愧，故此中止而不敢試。現在我的景况，日緊一日，事至不得已，故此特地寫信懇求先生，從速替我解决。我是藥店裏的職員；在我十三歳的時候，母親替我文定了王姓女爲妻。我父早故，不料前年母親，亦不幸去世，留下了我這苦命兒。家景很貧。我雖志抱自立，終不免孤掌難鳴，我的負擔，日重一日，婚期亦將近了。我岳父母他也無子，均在滬上，獨留她寄膳在她已婚姊姊處。岳父現已失業，平日用度，亦我貼補。他老人家因我年輕識淺，又無家長，現在替我作主，要呌他來滬與我結婚，我想來滬雖好，將來不免開銷很大，我的工俸又小，難以維持。假使結婚後仍舊送她回鄉，則我家中亦無親族照料，多是異姓鄰居，我不能放心。此事實使我進退維谷，先生乃吾輩青年的指南，現在請你代我想一解决辦法。敬祝</p>

<p>編者按：一個入世深的青年，至少需要一個休戚相關，年事少長者爲其顧問。童君倘使年已成人，經消力勉强可以担任，那没就採納了岳丈的主張，草草完婚之後，直捷爽快地與岳家同居；遇事可以彼此商酌，未爲不可。你的岳丈，現在是失業了；但這是在這不景氣時代不足爲奇的事；除非他十惡不捨，終有重新得到職業的一天。到那時經濟方面就可不成問題了。他旣無子，你又無父，樂得彼此合作。即使他一時難於找覔職業，那麽好在令岳等目下的開支，你也有力貼補，在上海地面，特立一個門户，固是費用甚大，但是在原有的門户之内，添上一個人口，還不至要費多少呢；要是尊夫人能刻苦勤儉，所費是决不會多的。所以假使令岳爲人端正，結婚時又能不費多金，那麽不妨聽你令岳的主張。</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（十五）這把我嚇了</p>
<p>室内寂靜着，表姊想離開這裏，她在徵求我的同意，我没有啓口之前，一陣高跟皮鞋聲，送進一位花枝展招的女人，臉上紅的白的廣告畫，掩不過她褪了色的青春。「客都到齊了，還不下去？」說話像舅父抽烟一樣的來不及衝出來。她的眼角纔注視到坐在烟榻下首的我。</p>
<p>「是你外甥」她說話老是這樣率直。</p>
<p>舅父點點頭，表姊歪歪嘴，無疑的，她是門房說的二姨太太了，我站起身來，呌聲舅母。</p>
<p>舅父得意的微笑。</p>
<p>二姨太太滿意的微笑。</p>
<p>「鄉下人怪誠實的，住幾天吧，我們這裏有空房？」一聲舅母的代價。</p>
<p>「不，就要回去的」我不得意微笑着回話。</p>
<p>舅父巳抽罷了烟，對着穿衣鏡安置他的瓜帽「行李搬來罷，舅父家裏有什麽客氣：」熄了火的雪茄還含在他嘴裏說話。</p>
<p>「慧兒…」他返轉身來說，似乎忘了付麽緊要的事，搬動被衣服包滿了的身體，從烟盤底下抽出一封信授給我。</p>
<p>「慧兒，你招呼青萍：」兩個不相稱的身體同時送出門外。</p>
<p>書封上僅是「青萍哥哥收閱」六個大字，是我弟弟的字跡。這是我撤謊失敗的原因，我想。</p>
<p>樓梯上的脚步聲漸漸消失，表姊抱歉的說：</p>
<p>「我忘了告訴你弟弟寫來快信，爸爸見了很生氣，說還是前天夜快車到上海的，忘不來見我丨我聽見了推說約幾個同學來聽講經，爹爹要我坐自己汽車去，我給了車夫一塊錢，喊他隨便兜個圈子。我趕到你們常住的清泰旅館，那賬房倒認識我，部他，你没有來，這把我嚇了…」她拍着自己胸脯「我想你别不到上海來吧！」</p>
<p>她避了我的視線「到花園裏去走走好嗎？」像不好意思似的岔開了話頭。（十六）總有你們年青人的機會</p>
<p>花園在别墅的最後面，並不寛大，却還精緻。從樓梯背後的小門中出來，經過小橋，！橋下的流水，像從洋房中來源似的：一條曲折的花徑，通正中廟字般的建築物，懸着斗大的「藏經樓」三個字，舅父建築别墅，而取名方外，意思似乎這樣，然而他希望有一個兒子。</p>
<p>我急於要知道什麽事值得一個都市姑娘害羞，無閒流覽這花園的景色，急急的問：「慧姊，我不來上海怎樣：」</p>
<p>「我告訴你說」她笑了「我想在報上登條廣告……」</p>
<p>我不等她說完，搶來說：</p>
<p>「慧姊，小弟弟現在並不是小弟弟了，我不來上海上海到那裏去，在上海還有我的朋友，我的…一時却接不上一個適當的Ｎoun或Ｐronoum來。</p>
<p>「我的什麽？」太約女孩子們都學會了頑皮孩的口吻，敏姊的「現在不是做夢啊，」那同樣的態度，在我眼前一閃。</p>
<p>我知道或者這時候我面上巳微微蓋上一層紅暈，搭訕着把弟弟的信撕了開來，表姊握緊我的手腕正式的說：</p>
<p>弟弟，你知道嗎，在電車上我幾乎不認識你。你儘量喝酒。我給你的信。近來也不見你的回音了。馨弟寫信來告訴我，哥哥己像老年人一樣。弟弟，爸爸對你不大投機，這是他的脾氣，等着吧，總有你們年青人的機會！</p>
<p>表姊注視着我，我說不出話來。表姊是愛我的，我可憐這生成的鄉下姑娘，爲什麽我的媽死去得這般早。</p>
<p>「慧姊，我感謝你，總之我己忘了我的過去…慧姊，我希望你記着，自己也是年青的人！</p>
<p>她低頭，我無語，兩人默默地走了一陣，大聲的嘩笑從前面送來，一羅花蝴蝶似的站娘跳團着飛進花園來，爲首的那個高聲喊表姊：「等了你這許多時候，還有講不完的話：」她笑着，一羣的跟着笑。</p>
<p>「弟弟，你把行李搬來罷，」慧姊輕經地說了，奔向她的女朋友去。</p>
<p>我望着她們的背影，消逝在那扇洋房的門裏。</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) The 49th and 78th Divisions are currently moving from western and southern Fujian towards the Zhejiang border, which proves that Fujian intends to strike first. According to well-informed sources here, war will break out soon. Leaders from both military and political circles are constantly meeting to discuss matters. Other than that, there are no major political developments. However, official spokespersons predict an imminent attack on Zhejiang province. As for Guangzhou, it is widely believed that if the Guangdong army does not cross the Guangdong border, then Fujian will not invade either. It is generally believed that Guangdong province will probably not invade Fujian territory. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) A general amnesty was announced here today, granting pardons to political and ordinary criminal offenders whose actions occurred before the 20th, regardless of whether their cases have been decided or not. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) The Economic Commission has decided to order the people to practice thrift and protect industrial and commercial capital. Xu Xiqing and others have been appointed to convene a meeting of the business community to discuss social issues such as food and finance, so as to foster cooperation between officials and merchants.

<p>(Fuzhou) It is reported that the Guangzhou office of the 19th Route Army has been dismantled and the troops are now marching towards Zhejiang. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) There are numerous societies in Zhangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, etc., with remarkably diverse names. Most of the organizers are key members of the communists, leading large groups of followers with fierce expressions, parading and demonstrating several times a day. Seeking revenge is especially common. Middle-class people are hiding and dare not go out. (Central News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Guo Chuntao said, "There is much speculation about Feng Yuxiang's attitude towards the Fujian affair. As far as I know personally, Feng has no major connections with the people of Fujian. Although outsiders know that Feng and Xu Qian are old friends, they do not know that Feng has always expressed disagreement with Xu's political views. According to my speculation, it is possible that Xu secretly used Feng's name and participated in the declaration this time, but Feng himself is an emotional person, and even though he knows that Xu and others have appropriated his name, he would not officially deny it by telegram due to friendship. He intends to let the facts speak for themselves. He is living peacefully in Mount Tai, reading and cultivating his character, and not asking about external affairs, so he can make his will clear to the world. As for the rumors that Yu Xinqing represents Feng and has taken office in the bogus government, I can personally vouch that this is not the case, because I have followed Feng and know that Yu Xinqing is not important to Feng. When there is correspondence, Yu is only used as a messenger. I believe that Feng would certainly not use a low-ranking Yu Xinqing as his representative to participate in the Fujian puppet government." (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>

(Central News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Overseas Chinese from Singapore say that when overseas Chinese in Nanyang first heard that Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu were colluding with bandits and harming the country, they did not fully believe it. After receiving confirmation, they all expressed resentment, especially the people of Fujian. During the January 28th Incident, when the 19th Route Army resisted the Japanese in Shanghai, overseas Chinese, regardless of their wealth, spared no expense to donate huge sums of money, totaling nearly 10 million, because the army could truly resist Japan and save the country. When they suppressed bandits in Fujian, overseas Chinese also provided much assistance and invested in large-scale industries. The overseas Chinese can be said to have cared for the army to the utmost. Now that they have acted in such a perverse way, the overseas Chinese, fulfilling their responsibility to save the country and their hometown, will serve as a backing for the Central Government and condemn them unanimously.

<h3 id="e35">Twists and Turns of Japan's Next Year's Budget <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi once optimistically said, "A budget of two billion and public bonds of ten billion are nothing to fear. The Japanese people will not be exhausted by this." Under such optimism, Finance Minister Takahashi finally brought Japan's 1933 budget to a staggering 2.3 billion yuan, an unprecedented amount, from 1.4 billion yuan in 1931 and 2 billion yuan in 1932.</p>
<p>The 1934 budget, which is currently under preparation, has a regular expenditure of 1.4 billion yuan, and new requests from various ministries amount to 1.2 billion yuan. In addition, new requests for emergency relief funds have reached 1.3 to 1.4 billion yuan. If Finance Minister Takahashi continues to handle the situation with optimism, even if he does not fully approve all the new requests, the total budget will not be difficult to reach a massive 2.5 to 2.6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>However, Finance Minister Takahashi's attitude has changed. He now takes into consideration the need to "maintain harmony with national strength." As a result, after a lengthy review of the 1934 budget, not only has the amount of new requests been significantly reduced, but regular expenditure has also been reduced from 1.4 billion yuan to 1.2 billion yuan. Regular and temporary expenditures are set at a total of 2 billion yuan.</p>
<p>After Finance Minister Takahashi announced this plan, the strongest opposition predictably came from the Navy and Army. According to Navy Minister Osumi's opinion, in order to prevent a serious crisis in 1936 and remedy the deficiencies felt at the London Naval Conference, Japan must increase its temporary expenditure for naval expansion by at least 1.25 billion yuan from 1934 to 1936. However, after review by the Ministry of Finance, of the 440 million yuan in new requests proposed by the Navy, the Ministry of Finance only approved 178 million yuan. The difference between the two is truly alarming. The Navy Minister of course firmly expressed his opposition. Whether Finance Minister Takahashi's plan can be passed smoothly is still in doubt.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the conflict between the Japanese military and financial politicians continues to escalate. This conflict over next year's budget is particularly fierce. Perhaps this is a hidden reef for the future of the Saito Cabinet.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese military has used the "state of emergency" as a pretext to overthrow party politics and achieve military dictatorship. They spare no effort in squeezing the blood and sweat of the Japanese people to sacrifice for their military adventures. Of course, in the current dangerous situation of international isolation created by the Japanese warlords, from a military point of view, Japan is indeed in a most serious "state of emergency." However, the Japanese warlords only see the military "state of emergency" created by their own hands, and do not see the financial "state of emergency" or the "state of emergency" of national strength. By next year, Japan's total public debt will soon reach 9 billion yuan, and the interest expenses on regular public debt will reach 450 million yuan, accounting for about one-sixth of the total expenditure and about one-third of the revenue. If this continues to increase, will the surge in public debt alone not lead to Japan's financial bankruptcy?</p>
<p>A country's finances cannot only consider the present but must also consider the future. In a year or two, the Japanese people may be able to barely support the burden of such huge military spending. But in a few years, when the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, I am afraid that they will not be able to bear even the minimum burden. In this way, as Seiyukai President Wakatsuki said, it would be like "using a skeleton to pull a cannon."</p>
<p>Now, Finance Minister Takahashi, who used to blindly follow the military's wishes, has also changed his overly optimistic attitude. The Seiyukai and Minseito parties have also warned Takahashi, advising him to consider the overall situation. However, the Japanese military authorities will not awaken unless they receive a serious lesson.</p>
<p>As a result, the now extremely hardened Finance Minister Takahashi will either completely succumb, or seek another compromise, or simply "leave it to the best."</p>

<h3 id="e62">Amidst the Increasingly Urgent International Situation: National Mobilization Plans of the Great Powers (Continued from Yesterday). Learning from the Unpreparedness During World War I: Tireless Efforts Over the Past Decade, Never Enough Time <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<h3 id="e63">United States <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Because of its abundant resources, the United States' preparation for general mobilization focuses on controlling the supply of military necessities, engaging in concrete and thorough preparation.</p>
<p>(A) Organs</p>
<p>(Central Organs) After the Great War, general mobilization was handled by the National Defense Council, but it ceased operations in 1920. Based on the revised National Defense Act, it was taken over by the Department of the Army, with the Under Secretary of the Army as the head of industrial mobilization. Under the Under Secretary, a number of supply bureaus are established, with the cooperation of related departments and civilian groups, to engage in research on military necessities, supply planning, and the formation of wartime organs, as well as the preparation plan for the entire general mobilization.</p>
<p>In 1931, the Wartime Strategy Committee was established, with the Secretary of the Army as the chairman, and composed of the Secretaries of the Navy, Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, as well as four members from both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Its purpose is to seek to balance wartime burdens and to eliminate various strategies for profiting from the war. At the same time, it considers the fundamental principles and outlines of general mobilization. (Local Organs) Under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army, the United States headquarters is divided into fourteen ordnance districts in peacetime. Each district has a necessary procurement committee, and the most powerful industrialists in the locality are selected as district chiefs to undertake the task of liaison between the government and arms manufacturers.</p>
<p>(B) Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>(National Defense Act) A National Defense Act was formulated in 1923, stipulating matters concerning military preparations and general mobilization operations under the jurisdiction of the Under Secretary of the Army.</p>
<p>(National General Mobilization Bill) In 1926, members of the Senate and House of Representatives submitted a National General Mobilization Bill to the Army Committees of both houses, with the aim of granting the President dictatorial powers of resource control in times of emergency, so as to fully implement emergency measures such as the compulsory requisition of personnel and materials, and price controls. Although the bill has not yet been promulgated, it is in fact proceeding towards concrete preparations.</p>
<p>(C) Preparatory Facilities</p>
<p>(Establishment of a General Mobilization Plan) The Under Secretary of the Army first formulates a plan for wartime resources and industrial mobilization and engages in concrete and thorough preparation. Other aspects, such as the standardization of specifications, wartime finance, and the establishment of various organs, are also subject to planning and preparation.</p>
<p>(Outline of Facilities) (1) National military training aims at cultivating wartime cadres, establishing reserve officer training corps, implementing civilian military training and camping facilities, and it is particularly noteworthy to cultivate reserve ordnance officer corps to fill key positions in industrial mobilization. (2) Establishment of an Industrial University. The university is located within the Under Secretary of the Army's bureau to train personnel capable of participating in the overall management of industrial mobilization operations. (3) Plans for the use of civilian factories: consult with tens of thousands of factories to ensure that as soon as an order is issued, they can immediately specialize in the manufacture of military supplies, and also engage in training workshops to learn the experience of arms manufacturing. (4) Protection and promotion of military-related factories: efforts are made to protect wartime industries that are difficult to convert or factories related to bombs, etc., and methods are studied to prevent the import of military-related chemical products such as dyes. (5) Development of civilian aviation and automobile industries to facilitate air force mobilization and the mechanization of the army. (6) National mobilization exercises and industrial mobilization exercises: since 1924, National Defense Memorial Day has been established to carry out trials of general mobilization. For example, the central governing body must issue fake定發orders at any time, and local bodies and factories engage in practical exercises such as receiving and transmitting communications and distributing production.

<h3 id="e64">Soviet Russia <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(1) Characteristics Different from Other Countries: Concentrating the power and financial resources of the whole country, and imposing profound sacrifices on the lives of individual citizens, in order to carry out its so-called five-year plan. From the viewpoint of national general mobilization, this five-year plan is not like other countries, which are merely limited to the realm of "planning" or "preparation." It can be said that it has already entered the "implementation" of national general mobilization.</p>
<p>(2) Organs: From the viewpoint of national general mobilization, the outline of the organs of Soviet Russia is as follows: (A) The highest governing body, equivalent to the Cabinet. (B) The Council of Defense and Labor, with the Prime Minister as the chairman and powerful figures from national and social institutions as members. Its duties are to determine the highest principles of general mobilization, regulate the relationship between national defense and the economy, and exercise some legislative and administrative powers. (C) The State Planning Commission, which is affiliated to the Council of Defense and Labor and the Cabinet, recruits authorities in various fields to directly undertake the task of planning and drafting proposals. (D) Implementation agencies, which are divided and implemented by various ministries. (E) Local agencies, which establish planning commissions in each republic to state and county to serve as local planning offices.</p>
<h3 id="e65">(3) Five-Year Industrial Plan <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(First Five-Year Plan) The main contents are as follows: (1) Heavy Industry: The purpose is to achieve economic independence and promote military industry. The contents are divided into: (A) Electrification: Invest about 40 billion rubles to build many hydroelectric and thermal power plants. (B) Metal smelting and machinery industry: Increase iron production by about three times, and copper, zinc, and lead production by about two times, and establish general machinery, automobile, and agricultural implement manufacturing industries. (C) Fuel: Seek to save consumption and increase the production of coal, peat, and oil. (2) Agriculture: The purpose is to reform the agricultural organization and increase agricultural production. (3) Transportation: Increase railway construction by 10,000 kilometers and promote the development of civil aviation. In 1930, a unified Civil Aviation Department was established, subordinate to the Council of Defense and Labor. (4) Vigorously promote national defense ideology and chemical warfare education. In 1924, the National Defense Aviation Chemical Association was established, with branches throughout cities and towns, with a membership of more than one million people, for the purpose of implementing practical education and training related to aircraft and chemical warfare.</p>
<p>(Second Five-Year Plan) The main contents are as follows: (1) Complete the reorganization of the overall national economy. (2) Create the latest technical basis that is universal to all sectors of the national economy. The machine-making industry is the key to this construction, and the electrification of industry and transportation is a key proposal for its foundation. In terms of agriculture, there is also a gradual trend towards electrification. The planned investment for this is 140 billion to 150 billion rubles, which is about twice that of the first five-year plan.</p>

<p>(Washington) The US government today formally stated that if other countries can eliminate their trade barriers against American goods, they will be given more favorable treatment for importing alcohol to the US. According to this statement, many countries, mostly in Europe, can be affected, all of which have high tariff barriers against American goods. It is found that in 1913, most of the foreign wines and distilled liquors imported by the United States came from France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Portugal, sparkling wines came from England, France and Germany, whisky came from Scotland, Ireland and Canada, and gin came from England, the Netherlands and Germany.

<p>(London) Conservative Party Member Dyna argued in the House of Commons today that Britain and its colonies should have unified tariffs.

Dyna further argued that British manufactured goods should be allowed to enter the colonies duty-free. Lister replied that British goods enjoy preferential treatment in the colonies, but if all colonies do not collect taxes on British goods, they will all have to rely on the national treasury for subsidies.

<p>Madrid The second round of legislative elections is imminent, and the election campaign has begun again. Streets are plastered with advertisements, and walls are covered. Political rallies are being held everywhere, but the atmosphere is not as heated as the first round of voting. Members of the Radical Party and the Republican Party have voluntarily withdrawn their candidacies, so only right-wing parties, that is, anti-Marxist parties, and the Socialist Party are participating in the election. The competition between the two factions is bound to be intense. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Madrid The Baliwos cabinet nearly collapsed today due to the resignation of Arsenio, the Radical Socialist Minister of Justice. However, President Zamora was unwilling to have a cabinet crisis before the by-elections to be held next Sunday, and temporarily appointed Education Minister Barnes to take over the Ministry of Justice, which temporarily quelled the crisis. Arsenio's resignation seemed to be due to his opposition to the Radical Socialist Party joining forces with the right-wing parties to compete in the election. According to Socialist newspapers, Arsenio insisted on canceling the November 19 election and reconvening the parliament that was dissolved before the election, but his colleagues did not agree, so he announced his resignation at today's cabinet meeting. According to other sources, Foreign Minister Albono, Minister of Public Works Bisono, and Minister of the Navy Romero all wanted to resign, but were persuaded to stay. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>Canada General Currie, the commander of the Canadian army during the European War, passed away today. Sir Currie was one of the distinguished generals during the European War and was known as the "Hero of Passchendaele" in Canada. This was because during the major German offensive in 1917, General Currie led the Canadian army at Passchendaele, defeated the enemy with fewer troops and became famous. After 1915, Currie successively served as the chief of staff of the Canadian army on the Allied front line. After the armistice, he commanded the occupying forces in the Rhineland. In 1919, he returned to Canada and was promoted to Inspector-General of the Army. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Minister of Aviation's Strong Air Force Policy Advances Rapidly in Both Houses of Parliament</p>
<p>(London) British Aviation Minister Marquess Londonderry declared in the House of Lords today that Britain must build a strong air force that is no less than other countries in the world. Britain's air force strength has now fallen to fifth place, and he wants to catch up quickly. The current weakness of the air force cannot be tolerated for long. We must make these islands and the British Empire safe in the skies. He also said that he deeply regretted that other countries had failed to reduce their air forces to the level of Britain, so he will do his best to avoid competition in the sky arms race. In the future, while Britain expands its air force, it will continue to work to persuade other countries to reduce their sky arms to the same level as Britain. However, he also reminded the parliamentarians that the United States, Russia, and Japan are currently expanding their air forces, and their strength will be unprecedented, so he has doubts about whether the continued efforts to reduce sky arms will be successful. The British Air Ministry's preparations for expanding the air force will advance rapidly in both houses. After Lord Lloyd and the Duke of Sutherland made requests in the House of Lords, citing the Aviation Minister's proposal, Admiral Sutter also introduced a bill in the House of Commons, strongly stating the fear and unease about the weakness of the British air force. When Sutter mentioned that the British air force had fallen to fifth place, the parliamentarians responded with cries of "shameful" and "shameful," which also shows the attitude of the parliamentarians.

<p>Britain Wants to Restore Its Status as the Number One Air Force Power; Air Routes to Be Extended to Hong Kong</p>
<p>(London) As a result of today's debate in the House of Commons on Britain's sky defenses, a motion by Conservative Party Member Admiral Sutter to draw attention to the weakness of Britain's air defenses was unanimously rejected. It was followed by a vote of 151 to 31 to adopt a motion by Conservative Party Member James supporting the British government's policies listed in the British Disarmament Draft Treaty. Lord President Baldwin, in closing the debate, said that Great Britain's position regarding its air, sea, and land defenses today cannot be isolated from the world. The disarmament situation is extremely complex, but no one in the government is disappointed. They are still working hard to reach a compromise in various ways. At the same time, the House of Lords also discussed the same issue. Aviation Minister Marquess Londonderry claimed that Britain was the number one air force power after the European War, but it has now fallen to fifth place.</p>
<p>France currently has 1,650 military aircraft, Russia 1,300 to 1,500, the United States 1,000 to 1,100, Italy 1,000, and Britain only 700. Britain must abandon its unilateral disarmament policy. If reductions can never achieve equality among countries, then Britain has no choice but to build more. At the same time, it will continue to work to seek international compromises and establish the lowest possible equal rate so that other countries can join.</p>
<p>During the debate in the House of Commons, Under-Secretary of State for Air Sassoon replied to a question from Conservative Party Member Balfour, saying that he did not want to increase the status of the British Air Force Commander in the Far East at present. He also said that the possibility of extending British air routes to Hong Kong is currently being actively considered. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Parliament Unanimous in Opposing Japanese Goods; Government Favors Concerted Action with Various Countries</p>
<p>(London) Conservative Party Member Fowler moved in the House of Commons today, demanding the abolition of the British-Japanese Commercial Treaty and the use of tariffs or prohibitions to restrict the competition of Japanese goods within the British Empire. Fowler asked the government to explain its intentions in the event that it could not reach a satisfactory quota agreement with Japan, and asked the government to immediately find a way to alleviate the competition of Japanese imported goods in the British territory and the British Empire market. If necessary, it could abandon contracts that hindered effective action. Fowler criticized the government for not taking concrete action and praised India's vigor in dealing with this issue. Fowler also said that the unfair trade situation between Britain and Japan is recognized by the Japanese themselves. Japan demands that any agreement be limited to Britain, Palestine, Ceylon, East Fiji, and the Straits Settlements. Britain cannot accept this as a basis for discussion.</p>
<p>Conservative Party Member Proctor seconded, saying that the government should send a cotton industry commissioner and organize a committee of experts to study methods of improving the cotton industry. He believed that they could create a plan for Lancashire to use Indian cotton, so as to eliminate Japan's request to share the benefits of the Indian market and eliminate the tools Japan holds in negotiations.</p>
<p>Conservative Party Member Holmesley said that Japan's current industrial policy cannot coexist with the economic security of the British Empire. In his opinion, the British-Japanese Commercial Treaty will have to be abolished sooner or later. He argued that the government should abolish this treaty under normal circumstances and not wait and see, which would make it difficult to clean up. Lancashire has decided to use more Indian cotton, which is not just lip service from Lancashire.</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce Runciman replied that if the government immediately abolished the British-Japanese Commercial Treaty, he did not see how Lancashire could gain much benefit. The government would rather exhaust other methods before taking this final step. Britain and Western countries are all feeling great difficulties with Japan. Countries may have to take concerted action in this major economic event. Therefore, Britain is now advising Japan that it is better to be on friendly terms with Britain than to pursue a policy of competition that causes resentment. He hopes that this problem can ultimately be resolved with wisdom and strategy.</p>
<p>This debate showed the consensus of the parliament, and Fowler's motion was unanimously supported. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Eastern News, the British House of Commons discussed the issue of preventing Japanese goods from entering the country yesterday. The proposal by Lancashire elected Member Weiying was explained by the British Minister of Commerce and passed the House of Commons by a majority.

<p>Avenol to Lobby in England; Secret Negotiations Between France and Germany Underway</p>
<p>Rome Foreign newspapers have recently spread rumors that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is attempting to unite the seven major powers to maintain world peace and stability. The authorities here believe that there is no basis for this, as Mussolini, although he agrees to the reorganization of the League of Nations so that the United States, Russia, Germany, and Japan can all join, his motive has not reached the appropriate time, so it is difficult to achieve successful results. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome Foreign countries spread two important news items: (1) Prime Minister Mussolini recently met with the British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Drummond, and discussed various German proposals, as well as Germany's attitude towards the Danzig Corridor if it makes a request. Representatives of the four-power treaty signatories should be convened to discuss it. (2) The convening of a seven-nation conference, especially inviting Russia to participate, will soon be realized. Recently, responsible parties denied both news items, saying that they were completely unfounded. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Some parties are spreading several impactful news items about the League of Nations Secretary-General's trip to Rome to shake people's hearts. The Havas reporter recently received reliable information that Avenol's trip to Rome was due to the death of Shereca, the former Italian representative to the League of Nations Executive Council, and he had to go to pay his respects and visit Prime Minister Mussolini. However, when Avenol met with Mussolini, the Italian authorities did not mention Italy's intention to withdraw from the League of Nations, nor did they advocate amending the League of Nations organization. What Mussolini is most concerned about is the future of the disarmament conference. The Italian authorities are eager for it to succeed and want to use the League of Nations mechanism to promote it. Only when it is ineffective or dangerous will consultations be held outside the League of Nations. Avenol, at the invitation of British parliamentarians, will go to England to give two speeches explaining the organization of the League of Nations. After visiting England, Avenol will continue to visit other European capitals, as it is his duty as Secretary-General of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

However, it is negative about the plan to persuade Japan to join the European peace issue, because Japan is willing to cooperate in the disarmament cause, but in order to proceed, European countries must first make efforts to rebuild peace. Japan has not yet seen the results, so it cannot rashly participate in the seven-nation conference. (Dentsu dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Brussels Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans today called on countries to continue the disarmament conference and closer international cooperation, stating that Belgium intends to maintain its obligations to the Treaty of Locarno and the League of Nations with Britain and France. The Treaty of Locarno will not be damaged in the slightest by Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. The treaty cannot be unilaterally denied. Belgium does not object to discussions between the powers, but asks that events directly related to Belgium's interests not be discussed when Belgian representatives are not present. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Brussels Foreign Minister Hymans made a statement to the Chamber of Deputies, saying that Germany's sudden withdrawal from the League of Nations and the disarmament conference is certainly worrying, but we should remain calm in dealing with the situation. In addition to this, there are factors in the international situation that should be reassuring, such as the treaties signed between the Soviet Union and its Western neighbors, the non-aggression treaty to be signed between Germany and Poland, the friendship between France and Britain, and the rapprochement between France and Italy. Belgium will do its utmost with Britain and France to protect the various international cooperation mechanisms. Hymans concluded that the Rhineland Agreement in the Treaty of Locarno, which guarantees Belgium's borders, cannot be changed. The audience applauded upon hearing this. The Chamber continued to discuss foreign policy, with a speech by Socialist leader Vandervelde, who first explained the fact that Germany is rearming, saying that he therefore agrees with Foreign Minister Hymans's views on the League of Nations and the disarmament conference. Aggressors should be prevented, but Vandervelde believes that all countries should disarm in unison. In his view, if all countries disarm in unison, Germany will be forced by the general trend to agree to disarmament. Vandervelde Shi said that the private conversations between countries are harmful to international public opinion, and said that only France is resolutely maintaining peace and seeking the realization of disarmament, but France is prepared to talk to Hitler alone, which may be a mistake. Catholic Party Member Sinzo criticized Hymans for his political and economic failures and demanded strict consolidation of national defense. He concluded that the Belgian people believe that Belgium should strictly guard its borders. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

This morning, the London Morning Post carried a diplomatic correspondent's message, saying that the British government is very concerned about the Franco-German conference. Baldwin and Simon both stated their views that rearmament is a solution. This view implies allowing Germany to increase its defense capabilities and military personnel. The Daily Morning Post now believes that the French government's representatives will not oppose the view of conducting negotiations on this basis. If so, the relationship between the French and German armies will be redefined. However, France hopes that the price of concessions to Germany will be Germany's return to Geneva. The British government, in view of the price that the French government will pay, feels obliged to assist France in achieving this goal. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia and Other Countries Prepare to Formally Recognize Russia; French Influence in the Balkans Reduced; Pan-European Conference to Be Convened in Vienna Tomorrow to Organize Five Major Groups to Restructure the Economy</p>
<p>(Berlin) The midday newspaper Moscow correspondent obtained semi-official news that Czechoslovakia or the entire Little Entente will recognize Soviet Russia, which is expected to happen soon. The various events that have recently occurred in Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia, as well as the several conventions signed between these countries, have led observers to expect that Central and Eastern European countries will form a large peace group and be linked to Soviet Russia. If this move becomes a reality, one of the results will be a reduction in French influence in the Balkans, and the hegemony of the French in Geneva will be greatly reduced because they will no longer have the support of these small countries. As for Soviet Russia, although it has no direct relationship with the future Balkan alliance, it seems that the support of the Russians is indispensable if the Balkan states want to create a united front to the West. Judging from the recent remarks of the Romanian Foreign Minister in the Turkish capital, it can be seen that the Balkan states all want to obtain the support of Soviet Russia, and there is no doubt that Russia is willing to be the supporter of small countries.

Kalergi also said that the problems that need to be solved at present are, first, the currency crisis, and second, the restructuring of the European economy based on local agreements to create the following five economic groups: (1) the Danube River countries, (2) the Balkan Peninsula countries, (3) the Scandinavian Peninsula countries, (4) the Baltic Sea coastal countries, and (5) the Soviet Union. If Europe wants to fight effectively with the Americas and the East, it must establish economic groups. As for the League of Nations in its current form, it can be said to be on its last legs. We must find a way to make it survive, and the way is to reform the League of Nations with the federal system as a new foundation, so that it will no longer be a union of several countries, but a union of several groups of countries, namely (1) the Far East, (2) the Soviet Union, (3) the Pan-American Union, (4) the British Empire, and (5) the United States of Europe.

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Liu Xiang ordered a general offensive of the Sichuan bandit suppression army, Chairman Chiang again sent a stern telegram urging them to fight and not to stand by and watch any longer. In recent days, the battles on all fronts have made considerable progress. The armies were originally divided into six routes, with Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Li Qixiang, Yang Sen, Wang Lingji, and Liu Cunhou serving as commanders-in-chief. Liu was dismissed for the loss of Sui and Xuan. The sixth route was then taken over by Fan Shaozeng, but Fan was originally under the fifth route and did not establish a separate banner. The battle locations were along the Qu River and the Jialing River. The Qu River line was divided into left and right routes, with Yang Sen and Li Qixiang in charge of the left route, and Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng in charge of the right route. On the 23rd, Yang's troops, Luo Jiede, Xia Jiong, Yang Hancheng, Gao Dezhou, and other four brigades, recaptured Yingshan County. The puppet army commander He Wei was wounded in the waist and died in battle. One puppet division commander and two regiment commanders were killed. The remaining bandits fled in disarray towards Jiangkou and Sanhui. Yang's troops then crossed Yingcheng and advanced northward. The third route, Li Qixiang's troops, also cheered and marched out, taking advantage of Yang's victory. Luo's division and Wang's brigade have advanced to the Wangjiachang line in Peng'an, and Li's troops have advanced to Dumulin in Yingxi, and Li Zongfang's brigade has advanced to Fengdengpu in Yingxi North, connecting with Yang's troops and launching a suppression campaign towards Jiangkou and Peng'an. Some of the bandits who fled from Yingshan fled to Jiangkou, and some fled to Sanhui. At that time, Sanhui had been recovered by the Fifth Route Army, so they joined forces with the bandits who were originally based in Sanhui and launched a large-scale counterattack. Taipingyan, Leiyinpu, Liangjiaoyan, Panshichang, Yujiasi and other places were frequently attacked by the main force of the bandits. After the Fifth Route Army fought back, the bandits were unable to succeed. However, the progress of this route was also slightly delayed due to its being contained. The Second Route Army, Tian Songyao's troops, and the First Route Army, Deng Xihou's troops, were jointly responsible for the Jialing River line. They originally planned to hold the left bank firmly and then launch a joint suppression campaign after Deng's army was concentrated. When the bandits came to attack, they sent Li Weiruyi and other troops to cross the Jialing River forcibly. After several days of fierce fighting, it was reported that they had occupied Tudie, Xiaojiashan, Pingtougai, LijiaShan, Shangyuanguan, Lujiagou and other places, advancing more than eighty li along the entire line. Part of Deng's troops has arrived at Zhaoguang, and all of them can be concentrated within a few days and join the battle group. The plan for five routes to encircle and suppress the bandits has been completed in the first step. The bandit suppression armies of each route are now proposing the slogan of joining forces at Peng'an and Yilong, connecting Qu and Jia into one line, and at the same time recovering Sui and Xuan to destroy the bandit's nest. According to a telegram from the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the main force of the bandits is still in Sui and Xuan, and they will invade from time to time. When Sui and Xuan are recovered in the future, a bloody battle will be unavoidable. Liu Xiang previously sent his representative in Hankou, Qiu Jia, to Gan to meet with Chiang, report on the bandit situation, and ask for instructions. After Chiang personally instructed him on the new strategy, he ordered him to convey it to Liu and implement it accordingly. Qiu completed his mission in Gan and returned to Hankou on the 25th, and has telegraphed all the points instructed by Chairman Chiang to Liu Xiang for a reply. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Uprising of the Militia in Deng County <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Thousands gathered for fierce fighting for more than twenty days. Liu Zhi sent the head of the security department to investigate.</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Deng County is adjacent to Hubei and is located in the remote southwest corner of Henan Province. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, it has formed a situation where the sky is high and the emperor is far away, and strength is king. All the power of life and death is in the hands of the leaders of the Republic of China, and these local emperors often fight each other due to conflicts of interest. Once a dispute arises, it lasts for several months. Moreover, in order to compete for existence, they all collude with and incorporate bandits to expand their personal power. Within the territory, from Sunzhuang in the east to Tangshan, Yushan, and Hengshan in the west, and from Menglou and Weijialou, which are adjacent to Hubei, in the south, sixty li from east to west and fifty li from north to south, there are no people due to banditry. More than 8,000 hectares of fertile land have become grass that is six or seven feet deep, and foxes and rabbits have become dens. All of this was created by these people. Recently, Tian Ziyue's troops in the third district and Dai Huanzhang's troops in the fifth district started a riot, and it has not been resolved for two months. Liu Zhi has sent Feng Jianfei, the head of the security department, to investigate and order both sides to stop fighting and wait for a political solution. However, it is not yet possible to predict whether it will be effective. Deng County is divided into nine districts, and each district commander has 500 to 600 regular soldiers, up to 1,500 to 1,600. Conflicts often arise between them. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Yang Jiesan, who was sent by Bie Tingfang, the commander of the bandit suppression in Wanxi, oppressed them too much, and they once united to oppose Yang. Later, they elected Zheng Xiangzhou as the director of the nine district offices and the deputy director of the Dengnei-Zhe (Xichuan) joint defense office. The districts were at peace for more than a year. However, Zheng was extremely weak, and last winter he was unable to withstand the pressure from the districts and left in anger. This year, Bie Tingfang was appointed as the commander of the Nanyang guerrilla, and sent Zhao Zesan as the captain of the Deng County Militia Detachment. Zhao and Sun Xianzhou, Sun Wenshan, and Pi Wenxuan were known to be friendly, and people called them the pro-Neixiang faction, while Dai Huanzhang and Zhang Zhenjiang were originally bandits who were recruited and stationed at Wenquji, about ten li northwest of the city, with more than a thousand men, and the fighting force was the strongest. Guo Jingting, Ding Jiayi, and others were incompatible with Zhao Zesan, and people called them the anti-Neixiang faction. The third district is in the east of the city, and the fifth district is in the south of the city. The two districts are adjacent to each other. Tian and Dai had long had a grudge. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, they fought fiercely for several months, and both sides were exhausted before they stopped fighting. At the end of September, Lou, a villager from Jinglou Village, which originally belonged to Tian Ziyue's jurisdiction in the third district, was close to Dai and seized several villages to break away from Tian's shackles and return to Dai. Before the incident was reported, Tian knew about it and led a team to surround his house. Only three of the twelve family members escaped. Then Dai united Zhang Zhenjiang and Guo Jingting to help Lou, and in Lou's name, secretly attacked Tian's camp and Tian's house (Tian's district headquarters was located in Jitan Town), killing his mother, younger brother, and others. After the incident, Wang Youqiao, the administrative inspector of the sixth district of Nanyang, rushed to the scene to appease both sides, instructed them not to seek revenge again, and instructed local gentry to mediate the situation. This was in mid-October. However, Tian Ziyue was determined to avenge the death of his mother and younger brother, so he united with Zhao Zesan and others to seek help from Bie Tingfang. Bie sent six regiments of troops, who set out from Neixiang and went south. The journey of more than 140 li was reached in two days, directly approaching Dai Huanzhang's fifth district. However, Dai already had Zhang, Guo, Ding, and others to help him, and he had recently purchased more than 20 machine guns and hundreds of rifles from a certain division in Laohekou, and his strength had increased sixfold. He was unwilling to show weakness and resisted. As a result, the two sides were in constant artillery fire and fierce fighting until now. Now Dai's outnumbered troops have been broken in eight of the ten villages and are afraid that they will not be able to support them. Although Feng Jianfei has arrived at the scene, he can only mediate if he has no troops. It is said that he has telegraphed the provincial government to send a plane to help suppress the bandits.

<h3 id="e91">The Government of Outer Mongolia Under Party Rule: The National Youth and National Parties Hold Power. All Systems Are the Same as Russian Organizations. <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The issue of Inner Mongolia's autonomy has come to an end after Huang Shaohong and Prince De and others met. However, the outside world knows little about the party and political situation in Outer Mongolia since its independence. Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia were originally one body. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the Beijing government sent Xu Shuzheng, the Northwest Frontier Commissioner, to govern Outer Mongolia, mobilizing a large number of troops and carrying new weapons to Kulun to declare its goodwill towards Mongolia. Due to improper handling, the Kulun civil unrest broke out in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Since the fall of Outer Mongolia, internal strife has occurred frequently in our country, and few people have paid attention to the Mongolian issue. This year, Prince De advocated a high degree of autonomy in Bailing Temple. Although the central government sent senior officials to negotiate, it still did not pay attention to the actual situation in Outer Mongolia. Because Outer Mongolia and Inner Mongolia are connected, it is necessary to prevent infection. According to Ms. Wu Ling, a Mongolian who recently returned to Beijing from Kulun, the actual situation in Outer Mongolia is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Process of Becoming Communist) The Mongolian people have been subject to the late Qing Dynasty for more than two hundred years. During these two hundred years, the foolishness suffered by the Mongolian people cannot be fully described. For this reason, there was the result of declaring independence from the late Qing Dynasty in 1911. Although the Mongolian people declared independence, they ultimately failed to succeed immediately due to their weak strength. Many twists and turns occurred in the middle, until 1920, when patriots organized the Outer Mongolian National Revolutionary Party and established the Mongolian National Revolutionary Government in the Tuylgolovsakhsk region. In March 1921, it issued a declaration and its outline for nation-building, which did not contain any communist color. On September 20 of the same year, about two months after Kulun was acquired, the government formulated the election law for the Small National Assembly. On October 27, the Small National Assembly opened, and although only 25 people attended, it occupied an important page in Mongolian history. At that time, it passed the government's proposed policy of freedom and democracy, abolished old laws, and formulated new laws and other important matters. However, the Mongolian Republic, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, adopted a constitutional system of European and American democracy, which was of course dissatisfied with by the Soviet Union and a group of Mongolian youth who returned from Russia, as well as dissatisfied members of the National Party. Therefore, a group of Mongolian youth who returned from Russia and dissatisfied members of the National Party, with the assistance of the Soviet Union, established the Mongolian Youth Revolutionary Party in Ulaanbaatar (Kulun) in August 1921. When it was first established, it was a small organization within the National Party, declaring its support for the National Party, and using the method of crossing party lines to mix with the National Party's work and supervise the government's left-leaning policies. Therefore, between the spring of 1922 and the autumn of 1923, the National Party split. As a result, the Youth Party won, and at the same time, the actual power of the government had to fall into the hands of the Youth Party. Therefore, the country's policy direction also changed at the same time. After the Youth Party won, the National Party's policies also became increasingly left-leaning. On July 8, 1924, the Mongolian government designated this day as a major memorial day, which coincided with the third anniversary of the expulsion of Wengeen from Ulaanbaatar, and on that day issued a declaration to implement the Soviet-style republican system. In November of the same year, it convened the Great National Assembly, passed the Declaration of the Rights of the Mongolian Laboring People, and formulated and promulgated the Constitution. At the same time, the representative of the International Communist Party sent a telegram to congratulate the conference, stating that the formulation of this Constitution was a major step forward in the Mongolian people's revolution and a success in the Eastern peoples' revolutionary movement. As a result, the Mongolian people stepped onto the stage of a communist society.</p>
<p>(Content of the Two Parties) The organization of the National Party adopts a committee system, with a Central Executive Committee located in Ulaanbaatar City to participate in national affairs, and branches are set up in various places to supervise the implementation of politics. The Central Executive Committee holds a general meeting of all representatives once a year to discuss various important issues within the party and related to politics. The organization of the Youth Party is not much different from that of the National Party. It also holds a general meeting of all party members once a year to report on the status of the year and discuss future plans. At the same time, it also elects 25 people as members of the Central Executive Committee. The Executive Committee meets twice a year to discuss methods for carrying out planned matters and elect a chairman. The Central Party Headquarters has an Organization Department to guide the organization and conduct of party affairs in various places, and a Propaganda Department to edit and publish various propaganda materials. Although the National Party and the Youth Party have formed an opposition in terms of organization, since the Youth Party gained power in 1924, the National Party's policies have also changed. Since the major purge within the party in 1925, it has become a purely red organization. Lin Di, the most powerful leader of the National Party, stated the following about the nature of the Mongolian Revolutionary Party in his paper "The Future of the Mongolian Revolution": "The ultimate goal of the Mongolian National Party is to realize communism." From this declaration, it can be seen that the National Party, which initially had the ideal of realizing constitutional politics, has in reality become a bubble. Therefore, although the two parties seem to be opposed on the surface, they are actually one. Moreover, the Youth Party is still a candidate for the National Party. Party members must be young people under the age of 25, and those who fight with the National Party are not separate factions, but only lead the National Party to the left.</p>
<p>(Political Organization) The Constitution of the Mongolian Republic was created by the Great National Assembly after the purpose of the National Party changed, so it is roughly the same as the Soviet Constitution. Therefore, the political organization is of course also similar. The organization of the Mongolian Republic is recorded as follows: (1) The highest power agency of the Mongolian Republic is the Great National Assembly. The Great National Assembly is organized by representatives elected from the people of villages and cities and the army. As for the number of members of the parliament, it is determined according to the population ratio of the electoral districts. The regular meeting of the Great National Assembly is convened by the Small National Assembly at least once a year. As for the temporary Great National Assembly, it is convened at the request of the Small National Assembly or more than one-third of the members of the Great National Assembly or more than one-third of the voters in the villages, similar to the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union. (2) During the adjournment of the Great National Assembly, the Small National Assembly becomes the organ that exercises the highest powers, that is, supervises the highest government organs, implements the resolutions of the Great National Assembly, and is responsible to the Great National Assembly, similar to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. The Small National Assembly is organized by members elected by the Great National Assembly. As for the convening period, it must be at least twice a year. (3) During the adjournment of the Small National Assembly, the highest legislative, executive, and command organ in the country is the Standing Committee of the Small National Assembly (i.e., the Cadre Council) and the State Council of the government, which is formed by members elected at each convening of the Small National Assembly. (4) The People's Committee is responsible for general state affairs, and its main power is in execution and command, but its highest legislative power is organized into: 1. Chairman of the People's Committee, 2. Vice Chairman of the People's Committee, 3. Chairman of the Military People's Committee, 4. Chairman of the Economic People's Committee, 5. Minister of the Internal Affairs People's Committee, 6. Minister of the Foreign Affairs People's Committee, 7. Minister of the Military People's Committee, 8. Minister of the Finance People's Committee, 9. Minister of the Justice People's Committee, 10. Minister of the Education People's Committee, 11. Minister of the Agriculture and Commerce People's Committee, 12. President of the Review Court, 13. Chief of the General Staff. In addition, there are two organs: 1. The Internal Investigation Office, 2. The Academy of Sciences. The Internal Investigation Office, also known as the National Government Security Bureau, is subordinate to the highest sovereignty and has absolute independent privileges, not subject to the interference of any other organ, and has three executive powers: the military police, the judiciary, and the police. It detects the entry and exit of travelers, prevents and controls the movement of residents, and arrests and imposes severe penalties on those who are suspected of being rebellious, so it is very similar to the Federal Political Security Bureau of the Soviet Union, and its purpose is nothing more than to prevent the occurrence of internal strife. The Academy of Sciences, also known as the National Academy of Sciences, is divided into the Library Department, the Museum Department, the Drawing Department, and the Compilation Department. It specializes in collecting ancient books and documents unique to Mongolia, as well as various products or academic reference materials, and specializes in translating new Mongolian books, surveying and mapping various maps, and teaching maps. Since its establishment, it has made considerable achievements in promoting the new and old cultural undertakings of Mongolia.</p>
<p>(Party-Government Relations) The Central Executive Committees of the Mongolian National Party and the Youth Party can be said to be the highest organs of the Mongolian government, standing behind the government and the parliament and holding real power, which is the same as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union standing behind the Soviet government and holding real power. Therefore, although the government's administrative policy is determined by the parliament, all bills of the parliament must be discussed and passed by the party before they can be handed over to the party group in the parliament. Moreover, all major political and economic matters concerning domestic and foreign affairs, as well as major issues that arise temporarily, must be discussed and decided by the party. Even matters decided by the State Council have the right to be rejected by the party, and the government only implements everything under the guidance of the party. In short, its relationship is "the party is the leader, and the government is the led", so it can be said to be "ruling the country with the party", that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat. The ultimate goal of the Mongolian National Party and the Youth Party is to realize a communist society, and at the same time, they represent the proletariat of Outer Mongolia today, so they are not similar to capitalist parties, which only represent the interests of individuals or a few people, but represent the interests of a class, in other words, they represent the interests of the majority.

<h3 id="e93">Guangdong Province Handles Winter Defense, Orders the Guard Brigade to Return to the Provincial Capital, Land Defense in the Urban Area Starts on the 26th, and Winter Defense on All Rivers is Also Arranged in Detail. <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to the recent changes in the situation, the military and police authorities have decided to organize winter defense starting from November 26 in order to protect public security. The Guangzhou Urban Area Guard Affairs will be the responsibility of the Kehui Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Military Police Command, and the Guard Brigade, Chen Hanguang's troops, stationed in the Southern Route, will be ordered to return to the province to be responsible for the suburban guard. Chen's brigade has been ordered and can first draw a part of the troops to the province within a few days. The time for the implementation of winter defense in the urban area is from the 26th to the end of February next year. If necessary, the period may be extended. The winter defense measures are generally based on last year's regulations and have been modified appropriately. The main matters are to strictly inspect travelers in the urban area, send more secret agents to prevent gangsters from mixing in, organize armed patrol teams and bicycle patrol teams to patrol the city day and night, and the water police bureau will send patrol boats to patrol day and night, cracking down on lodging boats on the embankment. All public entertainment venues and hotels will be searched by detectives in rotation. All armed police officers in the public security sub-bureaus and the water police bureau in the urban area must be stationed in the bureau at all times, waiting for orders to be dispatched at any time. On the sea defense front, the authorities regard Humen as a coastal fortress, and it is urgent to send ships to station in sections inside and outside Humen and in the Pearl River basin. Therefore, Li Jiezhi, the commander of the Humen Fortress, returned to Humen on the 21st to arrange everything. Zhang Zhiying, the commander of the fleet, also took a ship to the Shi Tou River area in Henan Province to inspect the various sections of the fleet a few days ago. Because the river channel in the Sanshan Shibian area downstream of Nanshi Tou is the exit of the provincial river, the Jiangda warship was previously sent to station there to guard the key point. After Zhang's inspection, he ordered the Haikang warship to patrol the river surface there, and if any suspicious ships are found, they must be ordered to stop and be allowed to pass only after being inspected. The fleet headquarters also handles the winter defense and segment ship liaison in the east and west rivers in accordance with the precedents of last year. The Haihu warship was sent as the general patrol ship of the West River, and the Jianru warship was sent as the general patrol ship of the East River. As for the allocation of segment ships, the provincial river area, such as Dasha Tou, South Bank, Yadu Guan, Bai E Tan, Nan Shi Tou, and other river surfaces, are stationed with Zhongkai, Suijiang, Leiqian, Jinma, and Jiangping ships. The Zhixin warship patrols from Humen to Lianhua Mountain, and the Bao Bi warship patrols from Lingdingyang to Humen. In the lower reaches of the West River, Jiangda, Jianggong, and Jianghan are stationed from Nanhai Sanshan to Shunde Caoxie Zhou, the Kelu ship is stationed at Ying Ge Zui, the Beijiang ship is stationed at Sixianxi, and the Zhuiyun ship is stationed at Sanshui River Mouth. From Sanshui along the West River up to Guangli, Yuecheng, and Ducheng, there are Leigen, Leikan, Leilong, and Haiying ships stationed at each section. The Shilong and Xintang waterways in the East River are responsible for the blocking and stationing of the Fubo, Longxiang, and Haiou ships. (November 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">He Jingwu Rectifies the Pinghan Railway: Purchasing and Replacing Sleepers, Repairing Bridges, and Reducing the Travel Time of Express Trains <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Hankou correspondence: Before the eighth year of the Republic (1919), the Pinghan Railway was known to be in good condition. However, after years of military destruction, its infrastructure deteriorated, leading to complaints from travelers and difficulties for merchants. Furthermore, the successive directors each held office for only a short time, lacking the opportunity to remedy the situation. In the past year, under the leadership of Commissioner He Jingwu, earnest efforts at rectification have been made. Over ten thousand steel rails and steel sleepers, and over five hundred thousand wooden sleepers, have been purchased and replaced. In addition, over twenty bridges, one hundred forty locomotives, and seven thousand freight cars have been repaired. Other facilities at various stations, such as platforms, shelters, fences, and overpasses, have also been repaired in succession. The railway now has a completely new look, washing away the sluggish atmosphere of the past. The express trains, regular express trains, and trains on various sections have also been well-equipped and run on schedule, providing convenience for passengers and merchants. In particular, the travel time of express trains, which previously took forty-eight hours from Hankou to Beiping, has now been reduced to thirty-nine hours. It is expected that the railway will soon be restored to its original condition before the eighth year of the Republic.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance Dispatches Personnel to Clean Up Xuzhou Paper Money: Thoroughly Eliminating and Preventing the Issuance of Private Currency, Over 50,000 Yuan of Paper Money Has Already Been Burned <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The private paper money crisis in Xuzhou has lasted for a relatively long time and is gradually showing signs of easing. However, a thorough solution has yet to be heard. Public exchange offices and various ticket shops still limit self-exchange to one yuan. The exchange places are crowded with people every day, and injuries are not uncommon. The Provincial Department of Finance has specially dispatched Commissioner Wu Gengyu to Xuzhou to supervise the cleanup. Wu has taken up residence at the Garden Hotel and initially engaged in investigative work, followed by consultations with party and government authorities and various sectors regarding cleanup strategies. Today (29th), Wu held another round of discussions at the Garden Hotel with responsible personnel from the party, government, and chambers of commerce, and progress seems to be gradually emerging. Mr. Wu also told reporters that he was sent to Xuzhou based on the intentions of the provincial department and the demands of the people of Xuzhou, determined to thoroughly eliminate the issuance of private currency. After investigating in Xuzhou, he felt that the ticket amounts reported by the various ticket shops should be further secured with guarantees, and the declared assets should also be publicly appraised to avoid the abuses of exaggeration and concealment, in order to provide a sufficient basis for the cleanup. Yesterday, the various ticket shops completed the guarantee procedures for the ticket amounts, and the assets are currently being appraised. This valuation must be estimated at the lowest possible value to avoid future disputes. It is planned that after the valuation procedures are completed, a financial adjustment committee will be organized by local impartial individuals to manage the assets and issue bonds to recover the existing private tickets. The number of these bonds will be limited to the amount of private tickets to be recovered. After the assets are auctioned, the bonds will be gradually recovered and destroyed. This method is considered more reliable, and both the current maintenance and future cleanup can be resolved from this. However, the issuance of bonds must have a fund to support the exchange, which requires cash. Therefore, this method has two major difficulties: first, whether the assets of each company can offset the ticket amount is a concern; second, the bond fund is currently difficult to raise. These issues still need to be gradually addressed. In addition, among the seven private ticket shops, Gongyu is a public-share company with many shareholders who have assets. She Yingchang has ordered the shareholders to clean up on their own and make as much redemption as possible, and a solution may be reached within days. If Gongyu can resolve its own situation and remove its 140,000 yuan ticket amount, it will reduce the difficulty of handling the remaining tickets. This plan is expected to be finalized in about a week, and efforts are currently underway towards this goal. As for the cleanup committee established by the county government, it has already implemented its resolution to burn the tickets yesterday. In the afternoon of yesterday (28th), the original tickets stored by each ticket shop and the tickets redeemed in recent days, totaling 253,075 strings and 500 cash, were burned in front of the county government's auditorium. Provincial Commissioner Wu Gengyu and representatives from various sectors were present to supervise. First, County Magistrate She Nianci reported the severity of the paper money disaster in Xuzhou, now facing the verge of collapse, determined to thoroughly clean up and eliminate the ticket scourge. Then, Commissioner Wu randomly checked the amounts, which were consistent. The amounts of each ticket shop were: Chunquan 27,880 strings and 500 cash, Yizhenxiang 10,000 strings, Buxinji 28,500 strings, Juhe 1,800 strings, Tianbaoyu 52,450 strings, Shixingchang 16,445 strings, Gongyu 116,000 strings. The ticket bundles were unpacked and scattered in the courtyard, then ignited with sorghum stalks and kerosene. The piles of paper money were completely consumed by the fire. It was found that the total ticket amount was 420,000 yuan, and this was the first burning, destroying 50,000 yuan, equivalent to one-eighth of the total. The remaining 300,000 yuan are still being squeezed out and awaiting redemption. (November 29th)</p>

A guerrilla force, consisting of the county police force and river patrol, would be dispatched to patrol each district during the winter defense period. However, it is heard that some districts are limited by funding, making it difficult to establish the branch offices as scheduled. County Magistrate Jin has ordered the district chiefs of each district to expedite the establishment and submit reports. Meanwhile, River Patrol Captain Shen Bangda and special investigators Zhu Zhangqi, Li Rusheng, and Ni Chongkuan have been assigned to take responsibility for winter defense.</p>

<p>Yue Miao Street in this county is a prosperous commercial area, with shops lined up closely, representing the essence of the commercial market.

Unfortunately, today (30th) at around 4 p.m., thick smoke suddenly billowed from the bedroom upstairs in the Chunyi Restaurant, located diagonally across from Yue Miao Temple. It was spotted by passersby, who alerted the fire brigades of various districts, and fire engines were dispatched to extinguish the fire, preventing it from spreading. After investigation, it was learned that a child in the restaurant's bedroom was playing with fire on the bed, igniting the bed curtains and bedding, nearly causing a major fire. It is heard that the Public Security Bureau will summon and interrogate those involved.</p>

<p>The Tonghui Road Huisheng Silk Factory suffered losses and went bankrupt, and the manager, Xi Huian, fled without a trace. The factory's male and female workers have not been paid for two months, causing a major uproar. The workers gradually gathered more than a hundred people and went to the Huichang Silk Factory in Nanqiao, demanding that all shares under Xi Huian's name in the factory be withdrawn as compensation. They refused to leave. Yesterday morning, the county government invited the county party headquarters, the county chamber of commerce, the silk factory guild, and the Huichang manager Shou Yiting to jointly discuss the matter and decided as follows: (1) All shares under Xi Huian's name in the Huichang Silk Factory, actually paid up to 1,500 yuan, will be withdrawn immediately. From now on, Huichang will sever ties with Xi Huian. Huichang Factory will still seek compensation from Xi Huian for the various losses suffered by Huichang due to Xi Huian. (2) The workers of Huisheng will be ordered by the party and government to leave Huichang immediately and express their apologies to Huichang. (3) Xi Huian has fled without a trace, owing wages to the workers and affecting social security. The county government will issue an arrest warrant and order him to be brought to justice and ordered to clean up. After the above methods were discussed and decided, the remaining wages will be raised by the Chamber of Commerce Industry Association from the Ruichang Run Silver Bank, which received the spring and summer dry cocoons of Huisheng, and the new wealth added by Huisheng.

<p>Xue Bingyang, head of the County Public Security Bureau, ordered Mi Bing, head of the Second Public Security Bureau Branch of Waigang, to be suspended from his post on the 28th because he refused to comply with the General Bureau's investigation of the customer's shack households and the revocation of Xu Wenzhao, the detective who caused a wrongful death case during his tenure in Jinjishan. Ling Guiyan was appointed as his successor. That morning, Inspector Bao accompanied Ling and two policemen to the branch bureau to take over. Mi, the former incumbent, requested a postponement of the handover on the grounds that Ling was armed to the bureau and had not yet completed the handover. Ling insisted that he had come under appointment, and they argued with each other. Representatives of local town offices and other agencies came to the city that afternoon to discuss the matter with Director Xue, hoping to persuade Mi Bing to stay and revoke Ling's appointment. Xue refused, citing matters of law and discipline. On the 29th, slogans such as "Down with Ling Guiyan" and "Retain Director Mi" were suddenly posted in the West Market of the town. Yang Jinggu, the fourth district chief of the area, reported a message from the business community that if Ling stayed in the town, there would be a strike. He telegraphed Director Xue to transfer Ling Guiyan back to the General Bureau temporarily. Xue agreed to do so to avoid further disputes. Today, District Chief Yang came to the city to mediate the settlement, but it is not yet known how it will be resolved.</p>

<p>Chen Jintang, a cook in Zhangjiashi in the tenth district of this county, is currently fifty years old. On the 25th of this month, he was suddenly murdered by his wife, Wang, who is fifty-one years old. This is because she is passionately in love with another man, which led her to commit this heinous act. This has attracted considerable attention in society. After the district chief reported to the county, Judge Guo, accompanied by the coroner and a Western doctor, went to the countryside on the 28th to conduct an examination. According to Chen Xiaohuai, the deceased's son, who is nineteen years old, his father was a cook. Because of his skillful cooking, he was known as a famous chef by the villagers. On the night of the 25th of this month, he returned from cooking at the house of his uncle Chen Xingjia. His mother immediately urged him to eat. However, his parents had been married for more than thirty years and often quarreled, so they were almost like strangers. Although my mother is over forty years old, she is openly cohabiting with Lin San nearby. However, when he returned that night, his mother suddenly changed her usual behavior and served him diligently. Jintang could not bear to disobey her, so he ate. Unexpectedly, he felt severe abdominal pain after the meal. Everyone suspected that it was a sudden illness and planned to call a doctor. Wang refused, saying that it would be cured in a moment and that everyone could sleep peacefully. Unexpectedly, after a while, they suddenly heard a cry for help. They rushed to check and saw that Tang Jin was lying on the bed. His brother, Jinsheng, kept a watch on the murderer. At dawn, he sent her to the police station and reported to the county for examination. When Judge Guo arrived in the countryside, he ordered the arrest of the adulterer Lin San, who had already disappeared. The examination revealed that the body's abdomen was now green and black, and there were heavy finger marks on the neck, indicating that he had been poisoned and strangled to death before death. However, what poison he had taken is still under investigation. He ordered the corpse's family to coffin him on their own. As for the murderer, Chen Wang, she was escorted to the Ninth Police Station and detained. That night, during dinner, while the guard, Gu Shiliang, was eating, Wang escaped through the window. Wang Zhihuai, the patrol officer of the station, submitted a report to the bureau requesting punishment and reported the above information to Judge Guo. Guo believed that such a serious murderer should not be allowed to escape, so he ordered that the case be handed over within five days. The guard, Gu Shiliang, is suspected of negligence and has been ordered to submit a written guarantee of 5,000 yuan. The Public Security Bureau has now issued a notice to various villages, offering a reward for her arrest.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: Member of the Central Committee Li Liejun previously sent a letter to Chairman of the Military Commission Jiang Jieshi, making suggestions on the handling of the Fujian incident and the opening up of political power. To this end, Mr. Li issued a written statement the day before yesterday morning, and yesterday morning he re-issued the original letter to Mr. Jiang. It is recorded as follows: "I have been in Kuangshan for a long time, and several months have passed. I hope that you are in good health and that my distant blessings are in line. Vulgar words are always valued as rare, so I have not reported in writing for a long time. Now Fujian has declared independence again. Although the outcome of the matter is unknown (omitted), I am deeply afraid of the country's danger and the public's confusion, so I cannot help but hope that at this time, the way to save and relieve the situation is to quickly liberate the people's freedoms of speech, publication, assembly, and association, and to grant them equal treatment in law and politics. This is the fundamental key to gathering wisdom and energy, securing the country internally, and defending against foreign aggression. All of this is what you, sir, have agreed to in the past, and now its implementation is even more evident. Otherwise, when will the world be settled? From the beginning of the Fujian incident, a peaceful solution should have a way, which lies in making good decisions. I respectfully offer a few words, and I hope that you, sir, will consider them."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Rumors in the City that the Min Army Struck First, with Reports of Contact on the Fujian-Zhejiang Border <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Since the Fujian rebellion, the central government initially intended to resolve it through political means. However, due to the Fujian province's actions of spying on Zhejiang, it was decided to use military sanctions. Therefore, in recent days, a large army has been mobilized and concentrated in Xianxia, Yandang, and other places, preparing to issue an order to suppress the rebellion. Unexpectedly, the military authorities of Fujian province are planning to strike first. According to news from the transportation sector yesterday, Xin Sheng News Agency reported that it was widely rumored in Shanghai yesterday that contact had begun in the Xianxia area on the Fujian-Zhejiang border. After Xin Sheng News Agency reporters inquired, they learned that the central army is currently taking a defensive position and has not ordered an attack. However, the rumor of contact is also possible. After the establishment of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, it has been criticized by various parties and is in a lonely situation. It does need to seek outward development urgently in order to strike first and seek a way out. A certain member of the Central Committee expressed regret over the rumors of contact on the Fujian-Zhejiang border, because the outbreak of war would have a significant impact on the autumn harvest. At a time when the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the farmers in the area, who have worked hard for years, are once again in despair.</p>
<p>Maps claim that the Min army is about to reach Pingyang, Ruian, and other places in Zhejiang Province to spy on Wenzhou. However, the central army has already stationed a considerable number of troops in that area. Therefore, if the Min army advances again, formal contact will inevitably occur. According to a person who arrived in Shanghai on the Sanjiang steamer from Pingyang on the 25th of this month, when he left Pingyang, the central army was gathering there, with a sense of imminent eruption. Therefore, the local finance has fallen into a state of chaos, and merchants have stopped loading passengers and goods, and the market is depressed, even to the point of complete stagnation.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: According to news from the headquarters of the Navy, the military deployment between the central government and Fujian on the Zhejiang border has been completed, and the war is about to break out. According to a certain party, the military authorities of Fujian Province have decided that once the war breaks out, they will move the current People's Government in Fuzhou to Zhangzhou, because Fuzhou's terrain is difficult to defend.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously sent a clever telegram, advocating the establishment of the principles of domestic security and foreign pacification, focusing on not seeking a temporary peace in one area while sowing the seeds of hidden worries for the overall situation externally, and focusing on military and political personnel each exerting their efforts in their respective duties internally. After sending telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang, it received a reply telegram from Mr. Jiang yesterday, saying: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, I have carefully read the clever telegram, and I admire your earnest discussion on the principles of domestic security and foreign pacification. The central government is advancing diligently along this direction. Jiang Zhongzheng, Written Order and Seal,"</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Yesterday, a certain foreign newspaper suddenly published a report stating that a certain private source in Shanghai received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that although Central Committee member Hu Hanmin refused to participate in the organization in Fujian, he had no intention of accepting a call to Beijing. He will join forces with Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of Guangxi, and You Guocai of Guizhou, to form a third government. As for whether it can be realized in the future, it will depend on the attitude of Chen in Guangdong. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter inquired about this news with a certain friend of Mr. Hu. According to him, this rumor is completely intended to provoke discord. He did not want to talk about the political situation in Guizhou and Guangxi, but he knew Mr. Hu very well. Therefore, judging from Mr. Hu's personality, he can only stay in Hong Kong to recuperate and will never take such rash actions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai authorities, recently because the situation of the Fujian rebellion is becoming more serious, and the war is about to break out on the Fujian-Zhejiang border. Shanghai is adjacent to Zhejiang Province and is a place where five parties gather. Fearing that all reactionary elements will take the opportunity to lurk and become active in the city, in addition to complying with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Security Office have been ordered to take precautions. Yesterday, the Municipal Party Department replied to the Municipal Government, requesting that military and police agencies be ordered to deploy defense forces in the city earlier and increase patrols to curb disturbances and protect the people. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Government immediately ordered the Municipal Security Office and the Public Security Bureau to follow the instructions, implement intensified defense from today onwards.</p>

<p>More than ten people from the New Voice Society report that Liu Heding and Zhou Zhiqin's troops in northern Fujian are adjacent to the defense area of the 19th Route Army. The 19th Route Army had previously tried to incite them in various ways, but they all refused. Later, Division Commander Deng Shizeng was sent to meet with Liu and Zhou, but they were also refused. The 19th Route Army, believing that Liu and Zhou were determined to support the central government and unwilling to cooperate at all, planned to exert pressure on Liu and Zhou, and searched their offices in the provincial capital. Tao Yungu, director of Liu's office, and Hu Xingqiao, director of Zhou's office, were well prepared in advance, so they managed to escape with difficulty, but the loss of equipment and luggage was considerable. Now, Tao Yungu, Hu Xingqiao, Li Dingzhang (former Fuzhou garrison commander) of Liu's army, and more than ten others arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Upon hearing the news, reporters from the New Voice Society rushed to visit them at their hotel. According to their account, the situation in Fujian is as follows:</p>
<p>Complexity of the Fujian Situation: The complexity of the situation in Fujian this time can be said to have reached its peak. The Fujian side has gathered all those who are not tolerated by all parties. Our troops have been stationed in the northern Fujian area and have been on good terms with the local people. Since the arrival of the 19th Route Army in Fujian, we have gained even more support from the people in comparison, because the measures taken by the 19th Route Army in Fujian have not been well received by the people of Fujian. Moreover, our troops have been in Fujian for many years and are more familiar with the situation, so the Fujian side has tried to win us over in various ways, and tempted us with various benefits.</p>
<p>Rejection of Representatives: Before the Fujian Incident, Chen Mingshu sent many people to our troops to meet with our superiors, but to no avail. When rumors were rife on the 18th, Chen and Cai sent Division Commander Deng Shizeng again, intending to meet with our division and brigade commanders to seek a final solution. Our division and brigade commanders still refused by telegram, which caused them to become angry.</p>
<p>Support for the Central Government: The final intention of the Fujian side has also been expressed many times, saying that if our two troops can earnestly participate, they will be specially expanded, and the funding will also be specially increased. If our two troops do not want to participate, then please strictly maintain neutrality, do not favor any side, and the province will continue to provide assistance as usual. However, our troops are still determined to ignore them, uphold the intention of supporting the central government, and persevere to the end.</p>
<p>Combat Capabilities: Now our division (Liu Heding's division) has concentrated in the Jian'ou area from Yanping, and our brigade (Zhou Zhiqin's brigade) is still stationed in Shaowu and other places, and the original defense has not moved. Chairman Chiang has already sent a telegram instructing us to await further orders, and there should be no movement for the time being. Moreover, after the 19th Route Army arrived in Fujian, they have gained a very detailed understanding of the combat capabilities of our two troops in the successive bandit suppression campaigns. Without sufficient preparation, they will not rashly attack.</p>
<p>Entering Beijing and Transferring to Jiangxi: We had previously received a telegram from our superiors, determined to support the central government, so we had made preparations early. All subordinate personnel have been secretly dismissed, but equipment and luggage, heavy objects, cannot be moved, and are still sealed up. The losses are considerable. We received a telegram from our superiors on the 25th and immediately left the province secretly. After various difficulties, we arrived in Shanghai today. We now plan to rest for a while, enter Beijing and transfer to Jiangxi, and report the details, because our superiors have already sent a telegram instructing us to report everything to the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Naval Battalion Commander Chen: According to the China News Agency, after Rong Yinglin, the fortress commander appointed by the Fujian side, took over Mawei, all the heads of naval departments in Fujian have fled separately. Li Mengbin fled to Sandu, Du Xigui came to Shanghai, Yang Tingying disguised himself and hid in the provincial capital, and Mao Shuyi, commander of the Changmen Fortress, also fled. Only Chen Tianjing, the commander of the Mawei Training Camp of the Navy Department, escaped from Fujian and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, Chen went to Gaochang Temple to meet with Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet, and reported the process of the training camp being occupied. He then took the night train to Beijing yesterday to meet with Minister Chen Shaokuan and report everything.</p>
<p>Party-Protecting Representative Gan: According to the Central News Agency, since Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Huang Qixiang, Xu Minghong, Xu Qian, He Gonggan, and others formed a new organization in Fujian, comrades of the Chinese Kuomintang in Fujian Province have densely gathered in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>The Party-Protecting and Traitor-Suppressing Alliance, and publicly elected Gan Yun, the former provincial director, as the chief representative, secretly went to Beijing to ask the central government to issue a traitor-suppressing order as soon as possible to save the people of Fujian. Gan Yun has already taken the Taikoo liner yesterday.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the matter of collecting land value tax in this city, regarding the land in areas one to seven in the South Shanghai District and areas one and two in the Zhabei District, has been determined for land value by the Land Valuation Committee. The Municipal Finance Bureau has received an order from the Municipal Government approving the collection of five-sixths of the land value tax for the second half of this year in all areas where the land value has been determined. It is scheduled to begin collecting taxes on the 21st of this month. The municipal announcement is recorded below: It has been investigated that the regulations for the temporary collection of land value tax in this city, as well as the scope of collection and the start date of collection, have been announced and implemented by the Municipal Government successively. Now, the land in areas one to seven in the South Shanghai District and areas one and two in the Zhabei District have been valued by the Land Valuation Committee, and submitted by the Land Bureau together with this bureau to the Municipal Government for approval and announcement. All land in the above-mentioned areas that has been valued shall pay five-sixths of the second installment of the land value tax for this year. It is hereby decided to start collecting taxes on December 21st of this year, and the deadline for payment is two months from the start date, ending on February 20th of the 23rd year.

<p>The Siming wheel from Nanchang arrived in Shanghai, and the following was reported:</p>
<p>Gan's Talk: The current situation in Fujian is extremely chaotic, and the people are extremely fearful, and are moving away one after another. Most people abandon their belongings and leave, believing that the 19th Route Army will implement communism. The traitorous elements are extremely complex, including members of the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, and the Nationalist faction, who are internally divided and cannot agree with each other. They also oppress the people severely, so the people mostly dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Except for a portion of students from Fujian College, the students do not approve of their actions. When the meeting was held at the South School Field that day, the students did not shout their reactionary slogans. Most of the leaders of the trade unions are hiding and not coming out, which shows their disgust. Many of the lower-ranking officers also have complaints, and the families of the higher-ranking officers have all left Fujian. The morale of the army is extremely scattered. They are now deploying defenses along the coast in Fuqing, Putian, and Xianyou, and are preparing to flee to Shantou and Chaozhou. According to the observation of the general Fujianese people, Fujian is a dead end. It cannot be attacked forward or defended backward. If the navy blockades its supplies, and the army attacks from Pucheng in northern Fujian, the rebels will not be able to last long. Those who left Fujian with me this time also include comrades Zheng Liru, Lin Jiaxu, Ye Yangmin, and Chen Hongxie, but unfortunately, they were captured by the rebel army in a small steamship on the Minjiang River. Their current status is unknown. I disguised myself and took the Taikoo small wheel, so I was spared. After arriving in Shanghai, I reported to the local associations here, and then went to Beijing to report everything to the central government, and begged them to issue a traitor-suppressing order as soon as possible to save the eight Min.</p>
<p>Party-Protecting Telegram: The Fujian Provincial Party-Protecting and Traitor-Suppressing Alliance sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and the party headquarters of all provinces and cities and newspapers: Heaven has afflicted our Fujian. Since the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, they have been acting perversely, oppressing the people, and extorting and gathering wealth, without leaving anything behind. Whispering is punished by death, and people look askance on the roads. What have the people of Fujian done to deserve such calamity? Recently, they have become even more intensified, not hesitating to destroy their own history and degrade their own personality, colluding with the communist bandits Huang Qixiang and Xu Minghong, and the remnants of the Nationalist faction He Gonggan and others, destroying the party and abandoning the country, and exterminating human relations. They have established a false name and are acting like bandits, endangering the party and the country, and their crimes are unforgivable. All comrades in Fujian are being trampled on, their speech is being suppressed, and their actions are being monitored. They are in extreme pain. As party members, we live as members of the party, and die as ghosts of the party. We hereby publicly elect Comrade Gan Yun as the chief representative to secretly escape and appeal for the prompt issuance of a traitor-suppressing order and the dispatch of a large army to Fujian to eliminate these ugly elements, so as to relieve the people's difficulties, comfort the spirit of the Prime Minister in heaven, and save the people of Fujian from their suffering. The telegram is urgent, and we earnestly plead for unanimous discussion and prayer. The Chinese Kuomintang Power Proposed Party Traitor-Suppressing Alliance.</p>

<p>The business and industrial circles of this city held a banquet at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge last night at 7:00 pm to celebrate the return of young aviator Sun Tonggang. More than 50 people attended the banquet, including business and industrial leaders Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Xuefan, Lu Jingshi, Pan Xusheng, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Jiaxing, Fei Yunqing, and representatives from various industries. Wang Xiaolai, chairman, gave a welcoming speech, and Sun Tonggang gave a reply. The chairman's welcoming speech and Sun's reply are recorded below.</p>
<p>Welcoming Speech: During the banquet, Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a welcoming speech, saying: In the past, international wars were always decided by naval battles, so there was a saying that the sea dominates the land. In the future, wars may be decided by the air force, because the naval battles of the future must first use aircraft carriers to carry aircraft to determine the outcome of the air forces of both sides. If one side's air force is defeated, then the other side can arbitrarily bomb enemy ships and indicate the accurate distance for firing. Because the range of shells of modern warships is more than 10,000 meters, the distance is far, and it is not easy to hit the target without using the air force as eyes and ears. This is one reason. It is recently reported that the US naval strategy focuses on the air force and not on submarines, because when the air force drops bombs, it is not easy to identify them in the water, and there is a fear of accidentally injuring their own submarines. Therefore, the US circular formation tactics are purely to use the air force to control submarines. This is the second reason. In the future, the air force should be in the first place, which has become an indisputable conclusion. Therefore, what we require is that our country revitalize the air force, one is to improve the aviation technology, and the other is to popularize aviation schools. Mr. Tonggang drove his single-seater aircraft from Germany back to China, crossing the desert and experiencing climate changes and aircraft damage. He finally arrived safely in his motherland in a journey of more than 20 days. This kind of long-distance flight is common in foreign countries, but it is rare in our country. It is hoped that he can use his excellent technology to guide the younger generation and set an example for the whole country, so that those who have learned aviation knowledge should not be content with the status quo and stop after a little taste, and those who have not learned but have a healthy body should also sharpen their spirits and rush forward to regard this as an important plan to save the country and the people, so that talents will emerge in large numbers and be able to try it out when something happens. I have heard that during the European War, there were 5,000 German aviation personnel at the front and 5,000 undergoing training in the rear, and 758 were replenished to the front every month, which shows the urgent need for air force personnel in wartime. Therefore, what our country needs now is the improvement of technology and the universality of talents, and both should be given equal importance. It is hoped that Mr. Tonggang will lead in the front, and outstanding young people will respond in the rear, so that our nation will have a place to survive. In the past, people always regarded returning to their hometown with wealth as returning home in glory. This is too superficial. We believe that Mr. Tonggang must bring his national salvation knowledge and turn it into a national salvation career to be worthy of the name of returning in glory. Therefore, on the day of his departure from Shanghai, we gathered together to celebrate and express our admiration. I have also heard that Mr. Tonggang still plans to learn aircraft manufacturing technology in Germany. This is a heavy responsibility and a long road, and he does not limit himself to what he has learned, and he especially has the ancient style of patriotism. I wish him even greater progress and that he will make a major contribution to the country in the future and add a different color to the national history. The future is bright, and I hope he will cherish himself for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Sun's Reply: Then, Mr. Sun Tonggang gave a reply, saying: Today, I am very grateful for the banquet and hospitality of the Shanghai business and industrial circles. I returned from Germany this year, and after returning to my hometown, I made a national flight, which took 57 days, flying for about 100 hours and traveling 14,000 miles. During the journey, I passed through the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, etc., to Beijing. Wherever I went, I was warmly received, which shows that the people of the whole country have a deep interest in aviation. This time, I came here to accept the aircraft donated by Mr. Du, and I am very happy to meet with you all. There are three things that Tonggang can tell you: (1) Aircraft are not dangerous, (2) The flight time is very accurate, (3) Our country needs the development of the air force, and the most important thing is the cultivation of talents. This time, I heard in Shanghai that the China Aviation Association has a proposal to organize a flying club. Shanghai is the economic and political center of the country, and there must be such an organization to cultivate talents. I hope you will support it. At about 8:00, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e122">National Ships are Prohibited from Berthing at Fujian Ports, Effectively Blocking the Ports; Businessmen in Pingyang Stop Handling Goods <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Ruian and Pingyang are border areas between Zhejiang and Fujian. Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the local situation has gradually become tight. Passenger and freight transportation has been suspended, and shipping has been blocked. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pingyang Stops Handling Goods: Pingyang, Zhejiang, borders Fujian. The main products of the area are coal and alum. Two companies in Shanghai, Huxing and Daxing, have a total of five ships operating. The area is a land port and goods are tax-free, so the export business of each ship is quite large. The main goods exported are northern and southern groceries and cloth. Since the Fujian Incident occurred, the trade between the area and Fuzhou has been cut off. Recently, due to the tense situation, the Pingyang businessmen have telegraphed Shanghai to stop handling goods. According to the two ship companies Daxing and Huxing, the Sanjiang ship will sail today, and there are no goods to be loaded in Shanghai, and the shipping business has suddenly become quiet.</p>
<p>Strict Local Defense: The Xin Sanjiang ship arrived in Shanghai from Pingyang yesterday. According to the ship's crew, since November 28, Pingyang has received Zhejiang troops dispatched by the central government, which have been transported from Wenzhou by small steamers in batches. They have been sent to the border with Fujian for defense. The central government's army is firmly defending the border between Fujian and Zhejiang, and the people in the Ruian and Pingyang areas have also stabilized. Although the freight volume of the Shanghai-Ruian ships has fallen sharply, the schedules are still open and have not been suspended.</p>
<p>Explicit Prohibition of Navigation in Fujian Waters: Yesterday, the Shanghai Shipping Administration Bureau issued Order No. 82 to various shipping companies, stating: Having received a telegram from Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission transferred by the Ministry of Communications, stating that since the Fujian Incident occurred, in addition to properly formulating countermeasures, please instruct the domestic commercial shipping companies not to berth at any ports along the coast of Fujian Province in order to cut off their water transportation and quell the rebellion as soon as possible. It is hoped that the handling situation will be telegraphed back. Upon receiving this, we must comply. In addition to telegraphing and distributing it, please inform all commercial shipping companies to abide by and report. The seal of the Ministry of Communications, etc. Yesterday, after the various shipping companies received this explicit order, they have informed the ship owners that if commercial ships pass along the coast of Fujian Province, they are not allowed to dock at any port in order to effectively block the Fujian waters.</p>

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway planes, which flew from Hangzhou to Beijing, began to make a circular flight along the two railways yesterday morning. The aircraft was piloted by Liu Chao, an instructor from the Aviation School. It took off from the Ming Palace Airport in Beijing at 10:30 yesterday morning and came to Shanghai along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. When passing through the major stations such as Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, it circled several times in the air. The station staff, etc., came out to welcome it. At 11:50 am, it arrived at Hongqiao Airport. Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, and others from the special party headquarters of the two railways, and Lin Wojiang, secretary-general of the China Aviation Association, came to the field to welcome and entertain it. At 3:00 pm, it took off again and flew to Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It will still circle over the major stations. If the time of arrival in Hangzhou is late in the afternoon, it will fly to Ningbo along the Ningbo-Caoe section this morning.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department on the 29th of this month, it was announced that the negotiations on the roads outside the concessions were initiated by the Chinese authorities in May of the previous year, and have been repeatedly discussed. However, the current Chinese representatives are no longer willing to continue in the originally proposed manner. The Chinese representatives believe that the proposed special police organization has been mixed with political issues, and these issues make it impossible for the Chinese representatives to continue to discuss the case at this moment. However, it is understood that the opportunity for continued discussion of important events related to the roads outside the concessions has not been cut off, so it may eventually lead to a solution to the whole problem.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Party Department of this city convened the Citizens' Traitor-Suppressing Conference organized by the eight groups. The second preparatory meeting was held at 11:00 am yesterday in the Municipal Party Department on the second floor. Lu Jingshi from the Municipal Party Department, Ye Xianggao and Long Peiyun from the General Labor Union, Yu Zhenza, Zhang Huijun, and Shen Linxu from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Wang Manyun and Zhu Yangwu from the First Special District Citizens' Federation, Huang Zaoxiong from the Municipal Education Association, Chen Qiying from the Middle School Federation, and Mao Yun and Gong Jingyan from the Second Special District Citizens' Federation were present. Lu Jingshi chaired the meeting, and Yu Zhongbiao recorded the minutes. After the usual ceremonies, the matters decided were: (1) The case of electing the conference officials: It was decided to elect one person from the party, government, military, police, and the eight groups, totaling twelve people, to serve as the presidium. Other lists such as masters of ceremonies, recorders, marshals, and commanders have been agreed upon, but there may be changes at that time, and the publication will be postponed. (2) The case of agreeing on the order of the conference: It was decided to pass it. (3) How should the conference logo be made? It was decided that each group would be responsible for making it. After the meeting, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Municipal Party Department Announcement: The Municipal Party Department issued an announcement to all circles to participate, stating: For the announcement, it is found that Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Chen Youren, etc., took advantage of the serious internal and external troubles to collude with the Communist Party, organize the government, betray the party and the country, and harm the people. All Chinese people are deeply indignant. If we do not strictly suppress them, how can we stabilize the party and the country and uphold the law? This association has specially convened various groups in this city to discuss and decide to hold the Shanghai Citizens' Traitor-Suppressing Conference at the Public Stadium on Dalin Road at 2:00 pm on December 2 (Saturday). This announcement is specially issued, hoping that all institutions, groups, schools, and party departments at all levels in this city will participate as much as possible at that time. This is of utmost importance. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Representatives Petition in Beijing, Requesting Amendments to the New Tax Regulations, Accusing Tax Commissioner Xie Qi <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Federation of Tobacco Industry Guilds of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiangsu, and the Joint Federation of Alcohol Industry Guilds, have repeatedly protested regarding the new tax regulations, all without result. Consequently, merchants and related workers in both industries feel extraordinarily pained. Therefore, eight representatives, including Yu Xunlu, Zhang Suhou, Zhang Dalian, and Chen Weiwen, were delegated to go to Beijing on the 25th to convene various representatives and discuss two concrete measures: (1) submitting a request to amend the tax regulations, and (2) accusing Tax Commissioner Xie Qi. On the 30th, they will go to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to petition and submit documents. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Government and Yuan: The purpose is to report that the Tax Commissioner has changed the old system and established new regulations, which harm businesses with excessive taxes. Enumerating the facts, we implore your Yuan to grant a consultation with the Ministry to dismiss him, to rectify matters, to emphasize national taxes, and to maintain people's livelihood. It has been found that Xie Qi, the Tax Commissioner of the Tax Bureau under the Ministry of Finance, has had some success in handling cigarette taxes and consolidated taxes, but he is unfamiliar with the situation of native tobacco and wine taxes. Moreover, native tobacco and wine have a considerable history, and local customs are uniquely different, relating to farmers' side businesses, and the nature of production and sales are completely different from cigarettes. Now, to have someone who has experience only in consolidated taxes but no experience in tobacco taxes take over this matter is already a misplacement of talent. Therefore, from the beginning of Commissioner Xie's takeover, he violated public opinion. The bidding contractor system for the tobacco and alcohol industries, which was hated like an enemy, had already been explicitly banned by the National Government. However, in the 21st year, the commissioner, under the beautiful name of the "Selection Committee System," was actually a disguised form of bidding contractors. All procedures were no different from bidding, causing fierce competition among general contractors, not only poisoning tobacco and alcohol merchants, but also making tax affairs extremely complicated. From then on, tax revenue was divergent, biased, and uneven. The rich left laughing with their pockets full, while the poor defaulted on public funds, abandoned their posts, and fled. The public sales achievements of previous years have all been swept away. A review of the original case of the 21st year's Selection Committee System will reveal its underlying secrets. The commissioner, fearing disregard for government orders and improper handling, and knowing that he could not escape blame, wanted to save the collapsing tide and cover up past mistakes. Thus, with wild ideas, he initiated further plans for special native tobacco taxes and fixed native wine taxes. If the plan were to succeed, all blame could be shifted to the poor public sales system. In reality, it smacked of recklessness, haste, and self-righteousness. It must be known that all political systems depend on human effort. If the public sales tax amount has been reformed over the past ten years, although it may not be perfect, it should not hinder national taxes, harm businesses, or sicken the people. Why abolish it so hastily? Prior consultations should have been broadly adopted. Why maintain strict secrecy? If Commissioner Xie truly had talent, knowing that the old system had drawbacks, he should have focused on eliminating accumulated malpractices. There was no need to change the course entirely. Simply remove the dross from the old system, retain its essence, and it would be enough. Only by increasing tax revenue, gradually eliminating embezzlement, benefiting the country above, and pacifying businesses below, could he be called a talented tax officer of the era. Now, the commissioner has taken over for two years and has already changed the system twice, even suggesting handling consolidated taxes in the same way as cigarettes. With such constantly changing orders, the people find it difficult to adapt. Now, this hybrid special native tobacco tax and fixed native wine tax have been recklessly set, completely ignoring the special circumstances of tobacco and alcohol, which relate to rural commerce and affect social peace. Is it possible that the national tax bureau does not have a single person familiar with the situation of tobacco and alcohol? This tax system can truly be called one of exorbitant taxes. Our Kuomintang's party platform has strictly prohibited this. Now, the various harassing articles are listed below: (1) Uneven tax rates. Examining the imitation Shaoxing wine (i.e., native yellow wine produced by Shaoxing merchants in Jiangsu), the tax rate for native yellow wine from various regions is 80 cents per 100 jin. However, the tax bureau cleverly created a name for native yellow wine produced by Shaoxing merchants in Jiangsu, calling it imitation Shaoxing wine, and taxing it at 1.40 yuan per 100 jin, an increase of 60 cents. For yellow wine brewed by Shaoxing merchants in various counties of Zhejiang province, the same tax is levied as for native yellow wine, without distinguishing the merchant's origin. Furthermore, the production area for Shaoxing wine is taxed at 1.40 yuan, while the sales area is taxed at 2 yuan. The taxes in the originating province should be equal, yet they are suddenly increased by 60 cents. However, native yellow wine produced by Jiangsu merchants has always been taxed equally, regardless of the merchant's origin (because the raw materials for Shaoxing merchants' yellow wine are indistinguishable from those of local yellow wine, and the selling price is similar). Equal treatment should be given to all. As for Shaoxing yellow wine, because it is produced in Shaoxing Prefecture and sold in other areas, the customary name is Shaoxing wine. Those sold within the former Shaoxing Prefecture are still called yellow wine. The tax bureau has set different tax rates for yellow wine produced in the former Shaoxing Prefecture of Zhejiang province: Shaoxing wine is taxed at 1.40 yuan per 100 jin, while yellow wine produced in other counties is called native yellow wine and taxed at 1 yuan per 100 jin. Moreover, Shaoxing wine has always been subject to provincial tax surcharges in the production area, amounting to 86.4 cents per 100 jin and a public treasury fee of 80 cents, totaling 1.664 yuan. When Jiangsu province abolished the likin tax, the provincial tax had already been abolished. Only a public sales fee was levied, at 1.20 yuan per 100 jin. Merchants acknowledged this, and the actual payment was 76.8 cents per 100 jin. Now, with the new system, according to the original public sales fee value of 20%, why is Shaoxing wine suddenly increased to 2 yuan per 100 jin? The actual tax rate is increased by 1.232 yuan. It is self-evident that the sales area is taxed more heavily than the production area. Also, in Shanghai, native yellow wine has traditionally been untaxed in the concessions and taxed at half rate in the Chinese area (i.e., special treatment). Now, the new system has failed to implement taxation in the concessions but has suddenly abolished the half rate and retroactively levied the full tax in the Chinese area. The above three points are clear evidence of uneven tax rates. (2) Extortion along the way. In the past, during the public sales period, merchants only needed to pay taxes to transport tobacco and alcohol without obstruction. Now, with the implementation of the new system, even after paying taxes and obtaining certificates, inspections are conducted along the way. The inspection procedures resemble disguised likin taxes. Furthermore, all kinds of difficulties are created, and payments must be made before passage is allowed. For example, 69 pieces of tobacco leaves from Jiangyin were extorted at 10 cents per piece when passing through Suzhou and Wuxi, amounting to 6.9 yuan. Another example is 15 years' worth of tobacco leaves from Guanyun, which were extorted at 1 yuan per piece by the Guantonggan sub-bureau, amounting to 15 yuan. (Both of these cases have been telegraphed to the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau by the association for investigation.) Furthermore, four boats of Zhang Kelai wine from Taixing, passing through Hengtang Town in Suzhou and Wuxi, had already paid taxes and affixed certificates according to regulations. However, the patrol boat inspector falsely claimed that the tax was insufficient and forcibly demanded a huge tax supplement of 200 dan, threatening a fine of 5,000 yuan. In reality, they wanted to extort fees for the certificate. The merchant requested an inspection by opening the jars and verifying the quantity and tax amount, which were found to be in compliance. They should have been released, but the inspector, failing to extort money, falsely accused the merchant of assaulting the inspector and sent the merchant to the local public security bureau, detaining him for five days. The above three points are clear evidence of extortion along the way. (3) Excessive penalties. When Taixing wine was transported to Shanghai, the public fee was previously calculated at 58% of the value. This time, with the new system, the sub-bureau stipulated that it should be calculated at 75% including the skin, according to regulations. However, the inspection office re-inspected and deemed it non-compliant, forcibly calculating it at 80%, and considering the remaining forty-odd dan as deliberate tax evasion by the wine merchant, rendering the affixed tax certificates completely invalid, re-levying the tax, confiscating the wine, and imposing a fine of more than five times the amount. This is clear evidence of excessive penalties. (4) Resembling double taxation. The government has explicitly ordered one tax per item. Tobacco and alcohol inventories have already paid the public treasury fee tax. Of course, the goods have already been taxed. Even if new regulations are revised, there is no reason for double taxation. As in the past, when the likin tax was abolished and replaced with a unified tax, items such as flour, yarn, cement, and matches were subject to the unified tax. We have not seen shops being refunded the old tax and required to pay the new tax. Now, for the tobacco and alcohol industries, shops are ordered to refund the old and pay the new, which is no different from double taxation. Moreover, for the inventories of retail shops, since they have already paid the public sales fee tax, there should be no need for registration (as exemplified by the Shanghai soy sauce and wine industry's request to be exempt from supplementing the new tax). Otherwise, it resembles double taxation. (5) Discriminatory treatment. While the fixed native wine tax is divided into categories with different tax rates, the special native tobacco leaf tax does not differentiate between high and low grades. All are taxed at 4.15 yuan per 100 jin. For high-grade tobacco leaves worth 70-80 yuan, the tax is 4.15 yuan, while for low-grade tobacco leaves worth 2-3 yuan, the tax is also 4.15 yuan. The cost difference is like heaven and earth. Tax rates should be differentiated according to the quality, as with wine. Otherwise, it is clear evidence of discriminatory treatment. In summary, the above points show that harassment has become a reality. Moreover, old habits have not been eliminated, and new problems are emerging. They claim that the laws are good and the intentions are beautiful, with no harm and only benefits. However, after the reform, tobacco and alcohol tax revenue has sharply declined compared to before. The underlying reason is the commissioner's poor implementation. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation, he used collusion tactics, appointing Huang Yuming (i.e., Huang Lu), the executive committee member of the association, as the director of the Shanghai Public Treasury Sub-bureau, making him a henchman to strictly oppress the people. Unexpectedly, the people's hearts have not died, and justice still exists. The sub-bureau director handled matters for three months with no results, and he retired in shame. For months, tax officials and merchants were in distress. It should be known that merchants are willing to accept tax increases by the government and fulfill their obligations, bearing the pain. There is no reason to resist, as long as the tax rates are fair and the procedures are convenient. Now, the commissioner is biased, holding prejudices and hating merchants. What crime have the merchants committed to suffer such misery? The associations, on behalf of all tobacco and alcohol merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jiangsu, have specially delegated representatives to enumerate the facts and submit a document requesting your Yuan to review and promptly consult with the Ministry to dismiss and punish him, to emphasize national taxes and maintain people's livelihood. We are infinitely grateful. In addition to submitting to (Executive Yuan), (Control Yuan), and the Ministry of Finance, we respectfully submit to the National Government (Chairman Yu of the Control Yuan) and (Chairman Wang of the Executive Yuan).

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railway Bureaus previously received an order from the Ministry of Railways to prepare for a Shanghai-Tongguan freight train service, running once daily from Shanghai Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and Tongguan Station on the Longhai Railway, passing through the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. However, after the implementation of the direct Shanghai-Pingjin through freight train service, goods transported from Tongguan to Shanghai are now transported via the Longhai Railway to Xuzhou Station, where they are transferred to the Shanghai-Pingjin freight train to Shanghai. Similarly, goods transported from Shanghai to Tongguan can be loaded onto the Shanghai-Pingjin freight train to Xuzhou Station and then unloaded and loaded onto the Longhai Railway freight train to Tongguan. Therefore, the Shanghai-Tongguan freight train service is temporarily unnecessary and has been postponed. The rumor that the Shanghai-Tongguan through transport would begin today is incorrect, as the national railway through transport has been implemented since November 1st.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the French Concession Taxpayers' Association, and the Citizens' Association of the Second Special District received a letter yesterday from citizens Zhang Yiqing, Li Yannian, and over 360 others, which stated: "Dear Sirs, it is reported that Jin Xi, a Korean who has obtained Chinese citizenship, was arrested by the Japanese consulate in Shanghai under the pretext of being arrested in the French Concession. Since Jin has acquired Chinese citizenship, he should be protected by our government. How can we allow the Japanese to arrest him arbitrarily? Yet, the French Concession authorities allowed the Japanese to make the arrest in the French Concession, and our government has not protested. If we citizens do not strive for his release, all residents of the concessions will feel personally threatened. We hereby send this letter to your associations, urging you to jointly protest, lodge a serious protest with the French Concession authorities, and demand that the municipal government negotiate seriously for his immediate release to maintain our sovereignty and uphold justice. This is what we earnestly hope for." Sincerely, Citizens Zhang Yiqing, Li Yannian, Xu Shuping, Yuan Zongdao, Chen Meian, He Renjie, Zhang Jiguan, Tian Siwei, Wu Xuchu, Hu Heming, Sun Zhaoxiang, Wang Zhuzhai, Huang Yiqiang, Jin Bufan, Xu Jiaqing, Zhao Liuying, Zhou An, Guo Yingjie, Feng Xinghuan, Jiang Xusheng, Xue Linsheng, Dong Zaizhong, Shi Jiajun, Ma Bailing, Qian Nengren, Zou Huchen, Zhu Dasan, Yu ChaoChen, Feng Jianxin, Zhang Daren, Li Wenan, Chu Liangmin, Xu Yili, Chen Zhiying, Li Shi, Wang Yuanji, and over 360 others.</p>

<p>The state-owned China Merchants Bureau is constructing three new river vessels using funds from the British Boxer Indemnity. After the blueprints were submitted to the ministry for approval, bidding began at the beginning of this month. There were five applicants, including the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Yard, the Ruirong Ironworks, and the Yiesong Shipyard. The tender opening took place at 3 PM yesterday in the bureau's board of directors meeting room. Those in charge were Liu Hongsheng, the bureau's general manager, Zhao Yuntai, the director of the shipping department, Zhou Houkun, the deputy director, Ye Zhuotang, the standing director of the bureau, and Li Zhiliang, the chief auditor. They all attended to supervise. After all the submitted price quotes and blueprints were opened, they were handed over to the department for review, and then submitted to the ministry for approval, and then forwarded to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee for evaluation before a decision could be made. Also, yesterday's board of directors meeting of the bureau was adjourned due to the absence of a majority of the directors.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Altered and Defaced Banknotes Indistinguishable from Genuine Notes - Society Suffers Significantly, Witnesses Also Apprehended <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Detectives Wang Chengying, Yang Xiguang, Yan Huang, Wang Hongsheng, and Liu Zhongcheng of the Jiaxing Road police station, learned that at No. 32 North Zhejiang Road and No. 231 Keenleah Road, someone was specializing in altering invalid banknotes from the closed Zhili and Guangdong Provincial Banks to resemble banknotes from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhongnan Bank, Ningbo Commercial Bank, and Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and passing them off as genuine notes in the market. Countless people have been deceived. Thus, at around 1 AM the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the addresses and apprehended the ringleader, Zhu Zhixiang from Zhenjiang, Zhu Likang, and a woman Zhu Zhang (i.e., Zhu Zhixiang's wife). Zhu Zhang was hiding on the rooftop of No. 32 North Zhejiang Road, but was still arrested. Zhu Zhang was responsible for altering the banknotes and sending them to various places for sale. 140 Zhili and Guangdong scrapped notes and altered notes totaling 228 yuan, along with eleven forged seals of various banks, inks, account books, knives, and other items were seized. Zhu Shouying and Zhang Yutang from Yangzhou, were also taken into custody as suspects, and separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the previous events, and stated that the defendants' method of alteration was to first use a knife to scrape off the words "Zhili" and "Guangdong". The three sizes of the various bank seals were used to change the value: the large seals to ten yuan, the medium to five yuan, and the small to one yuan, because the scrapped notes were originally one yuan each. After altering the Chinese and Western text, the notes were placed in a book overnight, and the alterations were undetectable, looking no different from the genuine notes. These people's skills were sophisticated, no different than a real note, and society has suffered greatly. He then submitted the notes and evidence for inspection. When questioned, Zhu Zhixiang confessed that this type of business began in March of this year, and a total of about four to five hundred yuan had been altered. The sources were purchased from money shops and tea servers, with minimal profit. Zhu Zhang denied the responsibility of selling the forged notes. Zhu Likang stated that he was staying at his friend Ni Haiming's attic at 231 Keenleah Road, and was not involved in this case. The police station's lawyer Zhang stated that the rent for the attic was found to have been paid by him, and 40 scrapped notes were also seized, indicating that the two parties were indeed in contact. When questioned, Zhu Shouying and Zhang Yutang stated that they had recently come to Shanghai from their hometown to sell chickens and crabs, and were staying at Zhu Zhixiang's place on North Zhejiang Road. The rest of the statements were evasive. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to be remanded to custody separately and rescheduled for further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Cricket Gambling Case Tried - Defendants Released on Bail Who Appeared Were Punished Yesterday - Defendants Who Did Not Appear Will Be Strictly Summoned Again for Interrogation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The building at No. 90 Jingxing Lane, Ningbo Road, owned by Huaan Bank, is actually owned by Wing Hang Bank. The room No. 20 on the fourth floor was recently rented by a person named Lu Heshang for a monthly rent of 55 yuan. A sign was hung up as "Qiyin Public Firm," but in reality, it was a secret large-scale cricket gambling venue. All the well-known people in Shanghai with a passion for fighting crickets participated, and the amount of money won and lost was unparalleled. The General Police Station learned about this and on the 22nd of the month, detectives Lu Gensheng, Liu Xiangzhai, Kang Zengxiang, and Li Wenbin, Wu Yaozu went secretly to arrest them. Five people, including Lu Heshang, who opened the gambling den, and 72 gamblers were arrested. The police station had already escorted them to the First Special District Court for separate sentencing and fines. However, Zhou Yijun, Song Yinsheng, Chen Wangsan, Zhang Yishan, and Zhou Shaoqing, who had been released on bail, failed to appear for the trial. The court ordered a rescheduling of the case for further investigation, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng Baosun of the First Special District Court opened the Second Criminal Court for trial. Zhang Yishan did not appear due to a matter and appointed lawyer Zhu Sifu to represent him in court. Zhou Yijun also appeared in court because he saw the report that the case was being tried yesterday. The rest did not appear. The police station's lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that when the defendant Zhou Shaoqing was arrested in this case, he was riding in car number 420, and after investigating the address, it was found to be at number 87 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. A summons was sent, but he did not appear in court today. Therefore, the police station requested that the defendants who appeared today be sentenced first, that the bail of 100 yuan for the defendants who did not appear be confiscated, and that warrants be issued for their arrest. Judge Deng questioned Zhou Yijun, and lawyer Zhu Sifu also made a strong defense for Zhang Yishan. Later, Judge Deng announced the judgment: Zhou Yijun and Zhang Yishan were each fined 80 yuan. Zhou Shaoqing, Song Yinsheng, and Chen Wangsan had their bail of 100 yuan confiscated. Zhou Shaoqing was fined an additional 100 yuan. Those who did not appear today will be strictly summoned for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Wu Liande Speaks on the Characteristics of the Chinese and English Nationalities <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>At noon on November 26th, the Returned Students Association held a luncheon at the Cathay Hotel, specially inviting Dr. Wu Liande to give a lecture entitled "The Characteristics of the Chinese and English Nationalities." Dr. Wu is an authority on public health, renowned both domestically and internationally. In this lecture, he meticulously explored the characteristics of the Chinese and English nationalities, presenting incisive arguments. The audience responded with thunderous applause. The following is a summary of Dr. Wu's speech:</p>
<p>The characteristics of a nationality, apart from heredity, are entirely determined by its environment. Therefore, to understand the evolution of a nationality, one must first examine the conditions of its origins. People often mistakenly believe that the purer the race, the stronger it is, such as the English, whose race is the purest, and therefore the most prosperous nation in the world. In fact, this is a great misconception. Now, please allow me to quote the words of former British Prime Minister Baldwin. Baldwin said that England was once under the rule of the great Roman Empire, so it became stained with a kind of aristocratic flavor. It was then conquered by the Saxons, a cruel and fierce race, which added a grain of seasoning. Later, various Nordic peoples mixed in, indirectly resulting in the ancestors who opened up England. Finally, they were conquered by the Norman people, becoming a mixture of Nordic and French races. Their sense of unity and national concept also became apparent. The reason why today's English people are rich in a spirit of cooperation, have a deep sense of family, possess a humorous flavor, and are able to dominate the seas and emigrate all over the world is because they are a mixed race.</p>
<p>Our Chinese people often have a misunderstanding about mixed races. Since the discovery of the "Peking Man" remains in Zhoukoudian near Beijing, it can perhaps be regarded as the ancestor of mankind. Leaving this aside for the moment, what can now be asserted is that the base of our Han nationality was in the provinces of Shaanxi and Henan, about 5,000 years ago, and then gradually advanced north and south. The reason why the people of Guangdong Province in our country have an adventurous spirit and an enterprising spirit is because their race is extremely mixed, containing a mixture of the earliest immigrants, Hakka, Dutch, Arab, Malay, Dutch, and Caucasian. Their descendants are also almost all over the world, such as Annam, Malaysia, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, Canada, Hawaii, the Philippines, the United States, Nikolayevsk, and other places, all have Guangdong immigrants. For example, in Hong Kong, the backbone of its society is a mixed race of Cantonese and English people. Furthermore, the founders of the three major department stores in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shanghai are all mixed-race overseas Chinese from Australia.</p>
<p>If we take a look at our country's history, when China was invaded by the Mongol, Hun, and Manchu nationalities, because the Han culture and unity were higher than the invading nationalities, they gradually became assimilated, and the inferior nature of the nomadic peoples was also absorbed at the same time. However, it was not like the English, who were able to fully absorb the superior qualities of the Roman, Saxon, and Norman peoples. Therefore, today's Chinese nationality lacks unity, excessively develops harmful selfishness, and has no scientific spirit. The reason for this is that the absorption of the inferior nature of the Manchus and Mongols has dragged down evolution.</p>
<p>Dr. Wu continued, saying that if you want to study history or the characteristics of a certain nationality, you must refer to anecdotal texts, especially biographies and novels. For example, by reading Scott's novels, you can know the truth about Scotland. If you want to know English life, it is best to browse Dickens's and Thackeray's works. The characteristics of our Chinese people can also be found in novels, such as Luo Guanzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which is particularly outstanding in its depiction of national character.</p>
<p>Dr. Wu concluded by saying that China and England have quite a few similar characteristics. Both have a glorious history, are rich in conservatism and enterprising spirit, have commercial solidarity, and treat foreign nationalities well (for example, China is the only country that has never expelled Jews, but instead assimilated them). Therefore, the two countries have common points and have close ties. They should learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses. Finally, he quoted the words of the former British ambassador to China, Lampson, at a farewell banquet in Beijing, "The two great nations of China and England have many similarities. Both are rich in basic common sense and have a keen ability to coordinate. What is beneficial to one country must also be beneficial to the other. I hope that this will lead to further understanding."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Private Shipping Companies' Request to Participate in Joint Transportation Resolved; Joint Office Established to Implement Cooperation; Private Companies to be Invited to Discuss Solutions <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) is managing the national water and land joint transportation. Various private shipping companies united to fight for permission to join. After a meeting of the Ministry of Railways, it was decided that state-run and private companies would cooperate to form a joint office to handle the joint transportation. Therefore, this dispute has been completely resolved. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Solution): According to the New Voice News Agency's Beijing correspondent, Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, came to Beijing the day before yesterday and jointly consulted with Yu Tan, director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways, Assistant Tan Yaozong, Yang Xianfen, deputy director of the Joint Transportation Office, and Gao Tingzi, director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, on the method of responsible joint water and land transportation. At that time, they all believed that private shipping is also providing services to society, and their request to participate is justified. However, the private shipping companies have different capital, routes, ships, docks, and warehouses. To facilitate the process, it was agreed that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sanbei Company would first convene various private shipping companies to discuss the method and establish a joint organization, named the Joint Office of Private and State-run Shipping Companies. Those who wish to participate in responsible water and land joint transportation must have definite routes, docks, and warehouses before November 1, and have registered with the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications and filed with the Ministry of Industry. They may apply to the two ministries of communications and railways for participation, and then discuss with each other in the joint office the method of jointly undertaking the transportation of goods. In this way, all railway freight in the country that requires water and land joint transportation to reach the final destination can be fully realized by the Joint Transportation Office and the Joint Office negotiating and signing a contract. As for the future negotiation of this contract, it will still be based on the contract signed between the China Merchants Steam Navigation</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Hongzhen Bloodshed Incident: Shen Linghua Dies, Du Linsheng Injured <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jinhua, a local resident, 40 years old, a coppersmith, and his younger brother, Shen Linghua, 34 years old, a tailor, both married with children, lived together at No. 21 Dong Yaojia Stone Bridge, Hongzhen, Zhabei. The family also has an elderly mother, who is over seventy years old. Usually, the two brothers work independently and live frugally, so although they cannot live in luxury, they are still well-fed. Shen Linghua also has a tailor shop at home, employing many tailors, who work all day long. Because the weather has turned cold recently, the work has been more frequent, so Shen and his employees, including Du Linsheng, work day and night, not sleeping until late at night. At about 2:00 AM yesterday morning, Shen Du and others thought it was late, so they stopped working and went to bed. Not long after, they suddenly heard a very urgent knock on the door. At that time, Du Linsheng had not yet fallen asleep, so he planned to get up and unlock the door, but the door had already been broken down by the people outside the door. When Du stepped off the bed, the crowd had already rushed in. Seeing Du Linsheng, they did not ask why, and stabbed him all over with sharp blades, causing him to be covered in wounds and lying in a pool of blood. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers fled in droves. However, Du was still conscious and desperately cried for help, alarming Shen Linghua and others upstairs. They put on their clothes and went downstairs to investigate. Seeing this situation, Shen rushed out of the house and searched for the whereabouts of the murderers. But when he reached a wasteland called Baiyangtan nearby, a person suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and chopped Shen with an axe. Because the disaster happened suddenly, Shen could not avoid it and was killed on the spot. Shen's brother, Jinhua, was unable to rescue him, so he quickly woke up Wang Shiyi, Shen Hongqing, Wang Asheng, and others who lived together, and first sent Du Linsheng to the hospital for treatment. On the way, they met a patrol of Chinese policemen from the Yulin Road police station. After questioning, because the matter was related to assassination, they were taken to the police station for filing and then sent to Sacred Heart Hospital in Yangshupu for treatment. Shen Linghua's body was later reported to the Fifth District, Third Precinct by Shen Jinhua, who instructed the local landlord to report to the court for inspection. The precinct also sent police to investigate the scene and summoned Shen Jinhua and others to the precinct for questioning, and dispatched detectives to search for the murderers everywhere. As for the cause of the incident, it is said that it was caused by a love rivalry.</p>
<p>Company and the Joint Transportation Office. The general outline will not change much. If there are any losses in the freight, the Joint Office will be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>(Contract Signed): As for the water and land joint transportation contract recently drafted by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Joint Transportation Office, Yu Tan, director of the Joint Transportation Office, has already signed it. According to news from Beijing, Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has also signed it in Shanghai. The procedures are complete and will be implemented on December 1. Before the establishment of the Joint Office of Private and State-run Shipping Companies, it will still be handled as usual to avoid stagnation. However, according to a definite message obtained by the New Voice reporter from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, in addition to the Longhai Railway, which has been implemented on the 20th of this month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has already handled the Jiaoji Railway, with ships running on the Shanghai-Qingdao line, such as the Puan, Wuyang, Longshan, Haixiang, Hairui, and others. The implementation of joint transportation on other routes will inevitably be postponed. Moreover, according to the Secretariat of the Bureau, the general manager Liu Hongsheng has not yet signed the formal joint transportation company.</p>
<p>(Board Meeting): The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held a board meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. The attendees were Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Shouyong, Shi Liangcai, Ye Zhuotang, and others. However, because the quorum was not met, the meeting was adjourned. Instead, an informal meeting was held, where General Manager Liu Hongsheng reported on the process of attending the Ministry of Railways meeting in Beijing, and then discussed matters related to undertaking water and land joint transportation and the Ministry of Railways' cooperation with state-run and private shipping companies. Because it was an informal meeting, no decisions were made.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Bandits Disturbing Yangtze River Ships; Military Commission Takes Action to Suppress and Maintain Order; Gospel for Yangtze River Travelers; Prohibiting Bandits from Impersonating Soldiers; New Prohibition Order Announced Today <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Yangtze River ships have been disturbed by roving soldiers and coolies, making it impossible for passengers to travel by ship. When Mr. Xu of the Central Party Headquarters went to Jiangxi, he witnessed this and deeply believed that unless strict measures are taken, no one will take the Yangtze River national ships. Therefore, he discussed with the Military Commission to reorganize the Yangtze River ships. This matter is of great importance to the shipping industry, and the following is a report:</p>
<p>Disturbing National Ships: Recently, Yangtze River national ships, whether going up or down the river, from Zhenjiang to Jiujiang, have been almost always occupied by large numbers of roving soldiers, scattered soldiers, and coolies. These lost coolies, whether genuine or fake, are indistinguishable. After boarding the ship, they do not ask about the situation and forcibly occupy the cabins. Even if there are passengers inside, they forcibly order them to give way. Disputes and arguments are almost inevitable on every ship. This time, when the Jianguo ship returned to Shanghai from Hankou, the traffic on the ship was blocked by soldiers and coolies, and the crew could hardly cope with it.</p>
<p>Party Committee Witnessed: Mr. Xu, a member of the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, went to Xunyang on official business this time. He boarded a Yangtze River ship in Nanjing and traveled upstream. After boarding the ship, he witnessed soldiers and coolies boarding the ship everywhere along the way, causing all kinds of disturbances to public order, which cannot be enumerated. Mr. Xu investigated in detail and found that most of the roving soldiers and coolies were bandits from various places impersonating them. Therefore, he decided to report this situation to the Military Affairs Commission and take strict measures to maintain the operation of the Yangtze River ships.</p>
<p>Approved by the Military Commission: After Mr. Xu arrived in Jiujiang, he reported this matter to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, who decided to investigate and deal with it. Now, this case has been taken over by the Military Commission, and the first step is to conduct a thorough investigation to find out whether all the disruptive elements on the Yangtze River ships are impersonating them. The Military Commission has appointed secret investigators for this purpose and issued special symbols. They will go to various Yangtze River ships and ride back and forth to investigate the bandits impersonating them and severely punish them to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>Three-Month Period: The secret investigation period has been tentatively set for three months. The Military Commission and the various shipping companies in this port have agreed that it will be implemented from December 1. The companies will notify each Yangtze River ship to check the credentials of the assigned personnel and exempt them from ship tickets. The companies will not pay them salaries but only provide food. It is said that the aim of the secret investigators is to reorganize the bandits and fake soldiers along the river who are harmful to travelers. Therefore, when they board the ship to carry out their inspection tasks, they are similar to ordinary passengers, making it impossible for people to recognize them.</p>
<p>Promulgation of Measures: At the same time, the Military Commission also formulated regulations restricting military personnel from taking ships and ordered various military organs and commercial shipping companies to post them on various Yangtze River ships and implement them from today. The measures are roughly as follows: (1) Military officers of all levels who take ships with formal certificates and symbols can take first-class cabins and officer cabins and pay half the ticket price. (2) Formal troops of one platoon or more (45 people) taking Yangtze River ships will be charged 50 cents per person according to special measures. (3) If they are traveling from Yichang in the upper reaches of the river to various ports in Gan, Anhui, and Su, they will be charged one yuan per person. (4) If they are demobilized soldiers returning to various places with certificates, the ship ticket will be waived, and they will pay for their own food. (5) For the transportation of military supplies and ordnance, those with formal passports will pay half the freight. In addition, if there are those who do not comply with the regulations or forcibly take ships by impersonating military personnel, the ships may hand them over to the nearest military and police organs for severe punishment to enforce discipline and maintain shipping.</p>

<p>After the completion of the new municipal government building, the municipal government has decided to move in and work on January 1, 23. Therefore, the staff dormitories have already been actively started, filling the foundation for construction, in order to move in at the same time in the future. Now, the water and electricity engineering, including tap water, electricity, lights, and telephones, has been fully installed. As for the traffic in and out of the downtown area, according to the person in charge of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company and the Chinese Tram Company have recently begun to contact the Public Works Bureau. The tram problem takes a long time, so in addition to actively planning and proceeding, it must be carried out gradually after the municipal government moves in. The public bus problem is planned to be solved by the Chinese Bus Company purchasing additional wheels and running back and forth every half hour. Once the detailed plan is determined, it may be put into trial operation before the end of this year.</p>

<p>The Zhenxiang Road between Zhenru and Nanxiang was built by the 19th Route Army Traffic Department, together with the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Jiading County Construction Bureau, during the January 28th Incident. At that time, due to the urgency of military transportation, it was hastily organized. All road and bridge engineering was very simple. In the past two years, only the road surface has been paved with coal ash once. The bridge has not been repaired. Now, the road has been connected to the Jiangsu Provincial Highway, and there are more and more vehicles. The bridge cannot withstand the load and is very dangerous. It is said that the Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, has submitted a request to the municipal government for funds for the reconstruction of the road bridge, so that construction can start as soon as possible. Otherwise, the road traffic will be temporarily cut off due to the bridge relationship to avoid danger.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Commercial Inspection Bureau Sends Personnel to Huizhou to Promote the Ban on Colored Tea <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The green tea produced in the Anhui and Zhejiang areas of our country is of excellent quality and has always been favored by foreigners. In recent years, the coloring of tea leaves has often contained inferior impurities, which has led to unfavorable publicity by Indian and Japanese tea merchants, and consumer countries have refused to import them, which has greatly affected international trade. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, in view of this, has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Industry to prohibit the export of colored tea. Although it is temporarily allowed to be handled this year, the ban will be strictly enforced from the time the new tea is on the market next year. However, the coloring of Chinese tea has been a long-standing practice, and it is difficult to completely eliminate it in a short period of time. To implement it, there must be sufficient preparation. On the one hand, tea merchants should be made aware of the importance of prohibiting the export of colored tea, and on the other hand, non-toxic coloring materials should be temporarily provided for substitution. The bureau has conducted various experiments and formulated various non-toxic coloring materials, which have been issued to Chinese and foreign tea merchants in Shanghai for trial use, and they have all been satisfied. Now, it is submitting a request to the Ministry of Industry for approval and limiting Chinese and foreign tea merchants to use them uniformly. It is deeply feared that the inland does not know the truth, so it has entrusted Mr. Fu Hongzhen, a technician from the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm, to take the opportunity to conduct detailed publicity on the ban on colored tea while investigating tea leaves in various parts of Huizhou. If it is unavoidable in the future, tea must be colored, and this non-toxic alternative coloring material should be used to improve tea leaves and consider the business situation of both parties.</p>

<p>The Public Bus Company of the Public Concession requested the Municipal Council to allow the public bus route 11, which is currently being trialed, to use larger vehicles. It was found that the bureau's bus was approved by the Municipal Council for trial operation at the end of July this year. After the new request was submitted, it was considered by the Public Utilities Committee. The Chief of the Police Department stated that the small vehicles being trialed did not increase congestion for general traffic, except in the Xihongkou area. Whether the use of larger vehicles would lead to general congestion is difficult to predict, but it may be approved for trial operation for three months and then re-approved. The Chief of the Public Works Department also supported the trial operation. As a result, the committee recommended and the board of directors approved the route to allow larger vehicles to be trialed from the intersection of Route Edouard and Zhejiang Road to Huishan Road for a period of three months. After the expiration, the Chief of the Police Department will report for reference.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Education has not yet formulated curriculum standards for teacher training schools, it had previously hired committee members to organize a discussion group on teaching subjects in teacher training schools. After several days of meetings, the group agreed on a table of teaching subject hours for various types of teacher training, which was approved and promulgated by the Ministry of Education and ordered to be implemented. This was the first step. The second step is to hire another group of committee members to draft curriculum standards for various courses in various types of teacher training schools, so that each can draft curriculum standards for the subjects they are responsible for. It is reported that the number of committee members to be hired this time will be much larger, about eighty or ninety people, due to the large number of subjects, unlike the twenty or so members of the textbook discussion committee. Therefore, a meeting will not be convened for the time being. After the drafting is roughly completed in the future, small group meetings will be held for each subject separately. The selection of committee members for this meeting has been largely determined and will be announced soon. After the teacher training curriculum standards are formulated, teacher training schools can also hold joint entrance examinations in accordance with secondary schools. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education will revise the measures for joint entrance examinations for primary and secondary schools soon. In the future, primary schools can be exempted from joint entrance examinations, and provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities will formulate random examination measures.</p>

If the Association considers the reasons sufficient, it will revoke the license." This was well received by the representatives of various countries. In this way, films that are considered non-compliant can be fundamentally banned.

<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association previously held an emergency meeting of representatives from the silk industry associations of the two provinces and petitioned the Ministry of Education to order all schools across the country to wear domestic goods. This was reported in a previous issue. It has recently been learned that the association received a reply from the Ministry of Education, No. 12276, stating that the petition to order education departments and bureaus across the country to strictly order all teachers and students to wear domestic goods has been noted and that all schools have been ordered to wear domestic goods. This order is for your information. Minister Wang Shijie, etc. Because of this reply, the association has already informed all silk industry associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Overview of the Chinese College of the University of Paris (Part Two) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>(2) Administration: Article 5 of the charter of the Chinese College stipulates that the college shall be managed by a council (also known as a supervisory meeting). The council members are the Dean of the French Academy, the President of the University of Paris, the President of Peking University, one representative of the Chinese government, two representatives of the Council of the University of Paris, and nine council members elected by the General Assembly of the College (four French and five Chinese). A Board of Directors is also established by the Council, which consists of one French Chairman, two Chinese and French Vice-Chairmen each, one Chinese and French Secretary each, and one French Accountant. In fact, the Council currently has only ten members, whose names and qualifications are as follows: 1. French side: Mr. Ban Lewei, Chairman; Mr. Mo Ni, Accountant; Mr. Keluozi, Dean of the French Academy; Mr. Shagedi, President of the University of Paris; Mr. Gewacai, Director of the French Academy; Mr. Bao Hai, Representative of the Council of the University of Paris; Mr. Telushe, same as above; Mr. Boshhe, Professor of the French Academy; Mr. Buwaye, President of the Paris Oriental Language School; 2. Chinese side: Mr. Li Shizeng, Representative of the Chinese government. From 1929 to 1931, the Ministry of Education hired former Chinese Minister to France, Mr. Gao Shuqing, as the acting representative. Since Mr. Gao returned to China in the winter of 1931, Mr. Liu Hou has been hired as the acting representative (before 1929, the representative of the Chinese government was Mr. Han Rujia). Mr. Xu Shichang, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Ye Gongchuo. The internal administration of the Chinese College is managed by one Director, who is Professor Gelanye of the College, and one Secretary, who is Mr. Mo Si. Both can attend the Council meetings, but have no voting rights. In terms of research, there is a research guidance committee, composed of seven Sinologists: Boshhe, Gelanye, Masbaiyi, Nalewa, Hakan, Feiluo, and Buwaye.</p>
<p>(3) Curriculum: Before 1926, the Chinese College was unable to develop due to economic difficulties. It only gave public lectures on Chinese culture in the classrooms of the Oriental Language School or the University of Paris every year. It officially started classes in the spring of 1927, offering seven lectureships:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese Culture, Professor Gelanye, Local Customs, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese Literature, Linguistics, and Art, Professor Boshhe, Sinology, Painting, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Chinese Aesthetics, Lecturer Nalewa, Poetry, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Modern Chinese Political and Diplomatic History, Lecturer Dibabiyie, the influence of foreign powers on Chinese internal affairs and the Mongolian issue.</p>
<p>(5) Modern and Contemporary Chinese Economic History, Lecturer Mo Si, Research on Xu Guangqi's Complete Book of Agricultural Administration.</p>
<p>(6) Chinese Law, Lecturer Aisi Jiawa, Interpretation of Han Feizi, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Chinese Science, stipulated to hire Chinese people, regardless of any kind of science.</p>
<p>The above six lectureships all have full-time teachers, but it is extremely difficult to hire a professor for the Chinese Science lectureship. It is not easy for those who study Chinese science to come to Europe, or they are limited by language and cannot give lectures. Those who study science in Europe have not seen Chinese science before. Therefore, the Chinese Science lectureship has not yet been filled. Four years ago, Mr. Sheng Cheng lectured on Chinese sericulture. The following year, Mr. Shang Ping was hired to lecture on Chinese agriculture and special products. The following year, Mr. Chu Minyi lectured on Chinese medicine. Last year, because there were no suitable Chinese scientists in Europe, the lectureship was temporarily changed to Chinese Literature, and Mr. Zhang Fengju was in charge. It has been decided that Mr. Wu Kang, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Sun Yat-sen University, will come to France to teach literature next year.</p>
<p>In addition to these seven lectureships, there are experts who are temporarily invited to lecture on certain special issues, such as Demieville lecturing on Tang Dynasty Buddhism, Favre lecturing on various secret societies in China, Dr. Leger lecturing on Chinese epidemics and hygiene, Masbaiyi lecturing on Taoism before the Tang Dynasty, and Dubosg lecturing on the current situation in China. Chen Mian also gave a lecture on Chinese opera.</p>
<p>The professors hired by the Chinese College, except for Gelanye and Boshhe, who are famous Sinologists, such as Dibabiyie and Dibuske, lectured on very superficial topics, mostly excerpted from ordinary newspapers and magazines, not specialized research. However, there are very few Europeans who understand Chinese, and it is very difficult to hire suitable people. This is also something that cannot be helped.</p>
<p>(4) Students and Their Grades: The number of students at the Chinese College has gradually increased in the past four years. There were 17 students in 1930, 27 in 1931, 39 in 1932, and 36 this year. By nationality, this year there are 18 Chinese, 12 French, and one each from Annam, Belgium, Germany, Japan, England, and Russia. The academic grades of the college are divided into certificates and diplomas. Students who study for one year and pass the exam are given a certificate. Students who study for two years, pass the exam, and submit a short thesis are given a diploma. However, to date, only one person from Poland and one person from Annam have passed the exam and obtained a diploma. Only one Russian female student and one French female student have obtained a certificate. Most of the Chinese students who attend classes at the college are preparing a thesis at the University of Paris and have already obtained a doctorate in liberal arts, totaling eleven people.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the large number of private tutoring schools, correspondence schools, and vocational training centers in the city, believes that those who can strictly abide by the education laws and regulations and apply to the bureau for establishment and registration are in an endless stream. However, there are still unscrupulous people who use the name of schools to post enrollment advertisements in order to achieve their purpose of defrauding money, causing young students to often not understand the actual situation, be deceived and harmed by them. There have been several cases of complaints to the bureau, especially from remote areas. Now, in addition to carefully investigating and strictly banning bad schools, the bureau has also sent letters to various newspapers, ordering them to indicate the words "established or registered with the approval of the Municipal Education Bureau" on all private school advertisements from now on. Otherwise, they will not be published. It has also ordered private schools that have been approved for establishment and registration to comply with this.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Jinan Suffers a Crushing Defeat of 5-1: Luo Haiguang Not as Steady as He Used to Be, Xu Yahui Unable to Support the Entire Edifice Alone <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Jinan had previously fought against Huosais twice, with the players giving their all. Fortunately, both matches ended in a 1-1 draw. Yesterday was their second encounter in the Schicota Cup. The Huo team's skills have been improving daily. The entire match yesterday was tense, and their footwork was also very nimble. In the morning, they took the lead with a score of 2-1. Near the end of the afternoon session, they launched a sudden attack, scoring three consecutive goals. Among Jinan's forwards, only Yahui was seen actively contributing. Center-back Xiaoyun was also quite competent. Gu Shangxiang and Xu Heng's contributions were balanced, with no major gains or losses.</p>
<p>First Half Saw Give-and-Take Exchanges: After lining up, the fierce battle began. Both sides immediately adopted an absolute offensive posture, resulting in a chaotic scene on the field, with players running and kicking intensely. The Huo team's five forwards repeatedly probed the goal, but all were blocked by Xu Heng. Xuebaite gained possession and moved north, breaking through the center-back line, delivering a perfectly placed cross to the center. Xu Heng missed the save, and Kangmuden tapped the ball into the goal. Jinan then launched a full-scale counterattack. Cai Lingcai dribbled past three opponents, passing the ball to left-winger Wang Nanzhen. Aigedun arrived quickly, and Wang immediately crossed the ball. Yahui unleashed a powerful shot, and the ball grazed the crossbar before rocketing into the net, leveling the score.</p>
<p>Xu Heng Carelessly Concedes a Goal: After the equalizer, Huosais' momentum surged again. Aqiao dribbled the ball close to the baseline. Ye Lunyan was forced to concede a corner kick. Aqiao took the kick, sending the ball into the penalty area. Xu Heng jumped out of the crowd and caught the ball to clear the danger. Yahui led the team on a counterattack, and a header went slightly wide, startling Hebaite. Unexpectedly, after narrowly escaping disaster, the Huo team's forwards reignited their ambition, launching a five-pronged attack. Heitan Didi's initial assault was thwarted, and Gu Shangxiang desperately resisted. Kangmuden seized an opportunity to shoot. The ball's trajectory wasn't fast, and although Gu Shangxiang managed to touch the ball, Xu Heng carelessly fumbled it, falling awkwardly as the ball slowly rolled into the goal from the left corner, eliciting gasps from the crowd.</p>
<p>Twenty Minutes Wasted: After the start of the afternoon session, Huosais temporarily adopted a defensive posture to conserve energy. Jinan's cavalry charged relentlessly but failed to break through the three lines of defense. Aigedun and Tao Lewei, like a tiger and a leopard, pounced on anyone who came near. Hebaite also displayed great skill. Xu Yahui launched several attacks but was intercepted by Simisi halfway. Qiongsi also tried to find openings, even shouting in the southern territory, but was driven out of bounds by Xiaoyun. Xuebaite made a comeback, and Xiaoyun returned the favor, repeatedly and bravely defending the king, earning the admiration of the fans.</p>
<p>Three Goals Lost in an Instant: Disaster often strikes when least expected. At this moment, Jinan was fully focused on scoring a goal to equalize, but the Huo team's ferocious nature suddenly revealed itself. Qiongsi, aided by Mao Lin, unleashed a powerful shot from twenty yards out, sending the ball diagonally into the net. Soon after, Mao Lin launched another attack, making the score 4-1. Aqiao, still not satisfied, made it 5-1, gaining an absolute advantage. Looking back at Jinan's players, their spirits were scattered, and they were unable to launch a counterattack. Soon, dusk fell, the whistle blew, and the two teams called it a day.</p>

<p>There were three basketball matches last night in the West Qing League: (1) Russian Community defeated French Academy, with a score of 38-23. Both sides' movements lacked clarity. (2) Jiangwan defeated Jinan, with a score of 34-29. Jiang Tao's skills have improved significantly. Jinan was consistently at a disadvantage. (3) West Qing defeated the French Army. West Qing comprised young players, and their teamwork was quite strong. Although the French Army was tall and strong, they were at a loss against them. They trailed 1-18 at the start. When West Qing changed their lineup, they gradually caught up. The first half ended with the French Army trailing 11-26. The second half was tighter, but the French Army eventually lost 19-35.

<p>After the football match, Jinan's players had not recovered their energy. Jiangwan, after intensive training, had shown improvement in their skills. Chen Zongqi was injured, so Ma Kaihua played in the first half, immediately posing a threat to Jinan. However, the score difference remained constant at around two points. After 8-6, Zhou Dayun and Qiu Guangxie of Jiangwan became very active, leading 15-10 at the end of the first half. After a brief rest, Han Zhenyuan of Jinan immediately scored a goal, but the good times didn't last. Afterwards, Fudan dominated again. Zhao Butian was overly enthusiastic and was sent off for four fouls. Guo Dingxin was substituted, and their momentum remained strong. Soon after, Wang Nanzhen of Jinan was also sent off. Jiangwan seized the opportunity to attack directly, with Qiu Guangxie displaying his skills. At the end of the time, Jiangwan finally won 34-29.</p>

(2) The location will be Jiaotong University or a track and field stadium (negotiations are underway). (3) The events will be open to both men and women. All events in the National Games will be included. However, since there are not many men who participate in hurdles, it was decided to change it to a 200-meter low hurdles. (4) No tickets will be sold. However, fearing overcrowding, tickets will be distributed by major stores and the four companies. Due to the short notice, other companies were not invited to join. However, a large-scale film industry sports meet will be held next spring. It was also heard that Tianyi wanted to give up due to some reasons.

<h3 id="e192">The Expression of Strength <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Boyuan</p>
<p>I remember that there was once a term in our literary world: "Literature of Strength."</p>
<p>There was no detailed explanation, but I guess it meant that literary works should not only have a fighting theme, but also have stimulating language. The so-called "sharp," the so-called "active," the so-called "rich in revolutionary emotion" were probably adjectives for the so-called "Literature of Strength."</p>
<p>Literary works have the mission of moving people. However, the power to move people does not lie in the "drawn swords" on the surface of the text. For example, wine, some are very strong on the palate, and some are mellow. Those that are very strong on the palate seem to have a lot of "strength" at the time, but that's all it is later. Those that are mellow on the palate are different: you don't feel its "strength" when you drink it, but when it takes effect later, you really get drunk!</p>
<p>A truly powerful literary work should be a mellow wine. The subject matter is just a simple story, but it contains rich content: it moves people and teaches people imperceptibly. The writing is just fluent and clear, without "amazing strokes" or convoluted structures, but it gives the reader a deep and lasting impression.</p>
<p>The production of such works is conditional, that is, rich life experience and sincere and profound emotions.</p>
<p>But it is not to say that literary works that are very strong on the palate are not desirable. However, writers should not be satisfied with "being strong on the palate."</p>
<p>China is not lacking in aggressive works now, but mellow works that become more and more powerful as you chew on them are still rare. Perhaps this is because Chinese new literature has not yet left the "youth era." The literature of a nation and an era is sometimes similar to that of an individual. Although (the youth era) is dazzling, it must go through a long and arduous creative experience to reach the stage of "maturity."</p>
<h3 id="e193">On Ass-Kissing <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Zhi</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang's article on "Kicking Ass" is both broad and refined. "Kicking Ass" is indeed one of China's national quintessence. But in China, ass-kissing is also one of the national quintessence. The meaning of its being a national quintessence is, like national medicine, national studies, etc., not something that all ordinary people can use.</p>
<p>These ass-kissers are also the ones who are "willing" to have their asses kicked.</p>
<p>Why kiss ass? In my opinion, it's probably like this:</p>
<p>There is a saying in the vernacular that says "ascend to heaven in one step." There are people who ascend to heaven, and I won't mention the methods they use to ascend to heaven here. But it is a fact that not everyone can ascend to heaven in one step.</p>
<p>But there are many people who hope to ascend to heaven in one step. They even know that they can't ascend to heaven but hope to be able to rise a little higher, suspended in the air, stepping on people's heads.</p>
<p>Since there are so many people who want to ascend to heaven but can't, they naturally have to think of special methods.</p>
<p>This special method is to find people who can ascend to heaven, hug their asses or thighs, and stick their faces to the waist or ass of the person being hugged. On the one hand, the heat on the face of the ass-kisser can increase the energy of the person ascending to heaven, and on the other hand, the feet of the person ascending to heaven can freely kick the ass of the ass-kisser. In this way, those who want to ascend to heaven but can't also ascend to the sky with others. After they ascend to heaven, whether they fart or pee in the sky, the spectators below watch them playing, happy, and farting on top like watching a kite ascend to heaven. When they are happy, they take out ingots of candy from their pockets, eat them freely, and spit out some residue.</p>
<p>To find an ancient method, it is the favorite minister hugging the king's ass, the minister hugging the ass of the favorite eunuch, the governor hugging the ass of the minister, the county magistrate hugging the ass of the governor, the bailiff hugging the ass of the county magistrate, and even the maids and servants hugging the ass of the bailiff. But between equal relatives, it is okay to hug the waist.</p>
<p>The person ascending to heaven is ass-kissed, and the kisser is also ass-kissed. Therefore, the result is that those who can ascend to heaven cannot ascend very high, and the feet of the ass-kissers often kick the faces of the people below in the air. As for the asses being kissed, there is also a distinction between domestic and foreign goods.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Ferryman <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiahua</p>
<p>If the wind keeps blowing, that's fine; what's scary is a gust of wind, a pause, and then another gust of wind, as if suffering from malaria, even if you're not cold, you'll tremble.</p>
<p>The river water is deep and blue, and when the wind blows, white waves rise everywhere. From the surface of the white waves, cold light shoots out like arrows. The river is very desolate. Those huge sailing ships are all silent, and very few rafts carrying firewood and foreign oil pass by; so this ferry boat crossing the middle of the stream alone is really very lonely.</p>
<p>The ferryman is an old man, wearing an old military uniform, barefoot, but very stubbornly wearing leggings. He is bald, and snot hangs on his sparse beard. If it flows into his mouth, he is busy licking it. Looking at his thin face and listening to his hoarse voice, who would believe that he can row a boat?</p>
<p>"Ferryman, quickly row the boat over here!"</p>
<p>He was originally squatting on the bow of the boat, or hiding in the cabin to steal a sniff of dry tobacco, but when he heard this shout, he had to throw the remaining half of the cigarette away and quickly pick up the bamboo pole, following the water, and row the boat to the other side. It's so cold, if he delays for a moment, then the passengers waiting anxiously on the beach on the other side, waiting in the north wind, will definitely curse him like a dead corpse:</p>
<p>"Are you dead? You still haven't come over after all this time!"</p>
<p>The wind is really fierce, and every time it blows, he has to shrink his whole body and shiver non-stop. Sometimes the ferry boat rocks, as if it will drift away with the current, and the more he rows, the farther he gets from the shore. The bamboo pole that he usually uses so skillfully also seems to have suddenly become unfamiliar, and his frozen hands can't hold it steady, and he almost drops it into the water several times.</p>
<p>Seeing his pitiful appearance, many people muttered: "He's really a dead thing, look at him, how can he row a boat, I think he should just stay at home and eat old rice."</p>
<p>Some said:</p>
<p>"I don't know if he is rowing the boat, or the boat is rowing him!"</p>
<p>But in the midst of all the accusations, the boat was finally rowed to the shore by him. Because the small pier is broken, and the gangplank can't be set up, people wearing shoes and socks can't simply step into the shallow, muddy water: to walk from the beach to the ferry boat, there is no other way but to carry them on your back, and this hard labor is naturally his job again.</p>
<p>"The water is really cold, it's like ice, piercing to the bone, we poor people..."</p>
<p>He bent his back, gasped for breath, and shyly said this from time to time, and looked back at the person on his back, hoping to get some money for wine, but no one paid attention to him, and no one was willing to give him a penny.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no one else on the shore, he struggled to pick up the bamboo pole again, facing the wind, under the dark and gloomy sky, inch by inch, and rowed the boat back.</p>
<p>"It's really cold today, it's probably going to snow, right?"</p>
<p>Someone suddenly asked halfway.</p>
<p>"My fingers feel like they're falling off."</p>
<p>Someone immediately sighed and answered with a cold breath.</p>
<p>"Old man, the water must be especially cold, aren't you cold rowing the boat all day?"</p>
<p>The ferryman just shook his head and didn't answer, this question is really boring. He frowned and looked at the distant mountains, looking at the wilderness, while shaking the ferry boat, his whole body trembling, and no one understood what he was thinking.</p>
<p>In his constant ferrying back and forth, the day quietly passed, and soon it was dusk.</p>
<p>Although he was lonely during the day, he still heard a little human voice from a few passengers. But at night, on this lonely and desolate river, only he alone slept in the cabin.</p>
<p>"Ferryman, quickly row the boat over here!"</p>
<p>In his dreams, this restless old man would also be awakened by this shout, thinking that someone picking up New Year's goods or walking at night was waiting for him on the other side; but when he poked his head out, he only saw a cold, abyss of night.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Sai Zhenzhu's "New Road" <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Shengfu</p>
<p>To this day, I have rarely read Sai Zhenzhu's works. Her "The Good Earth" is said to be a novel depicting the lives of farmers, and it is very successful. However, what I am talking about now is one of her short stories, "The New Road."</p>
<p>Because the author is a famous person, and it is said that "she has long been recognized abroad," I don't want to talk about the words in the field of literary academic. In this point, the article is indeed very successful in this regard.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the consciousness of "The New Road."</p>
<p>"The New Road" clearly implies two eras. One is that the era when people went to the tiger stove to buy water has passed, and what follows is the era of replacing it with "running hot water pipes." The era of those "small carts, rickshaws, and donkeys crowding around, the narrow and winding small streets built for more than a thousand years has passed, and now it is the era of building a "vast and distant" new road, "not even if all the people in the world come here, it will not be crowded."" "Now is the age of revolution."</p>
<p>"Now is the age of rebellious sons, the age of lazy people," he draws the same two generations of characters in Turgenev's Fathers and Sons.</p>
<p>The father's era is finally over. Although Lu Shun stubbornly sits on the ruins of the tiger stove, watching people tear down the tiles on the roof, "letting the midday sun scorch him," in the end, he can't resist his son's repeated requests and has to "stand up, as if he is very old, hold his son's hand, and follow him."</p>
<p>What is the era that follows? It is that some small carts, donkey carts, and tiger stoves are gone, and on the new road, there are naturally trams, cars, and high-rise foreign buildings, and the owners of foreign buildings. At the same time, outside Beimenkou, on the open space in the nearby fields, there are small grass sheds, not as good as the grass sheds of tiger stoves, and the people who go to the grass sheds.</p>
<p>Although the old man is obsessed with the past, the son is satisfied with the present. Because he can get fifty yuan a month from "this new road," he proudly answers his father: "The new government allows me to." He is very satisfied with being a supervisor. Naturally, he cannot realize that everyone does not want to live in grass sheds and wants to enjoy high-rise buildings equipped with "running hot water." The construction of the new road should no longer have "a cry of crying," and there is no need for such a majestic officer and "three soldiers."</p>
<p>In short: the consciousness of this work is not enough. The era implied by the author has passed in Europe one or two hundred years ago. Although it has begun in China more than thirty years ago and has not yet completed its process, this new road can no longer continue to be opened up according to the old trajectory. It must take a leap and reach another future. Naturally, the author cannot realize this profound point, which is determined by the author's social stratum, and is not surprising. The good weaknesses are thus revealed, and she cannot grasp the practice of China's current stage.</p>
<p>"Where does this new road lead to?" Following the direction implied by the author, we only hear "We are doomed, we are doomed," a cry of crying.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Two Brothers (45) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He pondered, but could not recall anything. But he must not have looked closely enough, not observed accurately enough, because at the time he had no reason to discover these telltale signs.</p>
<p>He stood up, preparing to return to his own room. He slowly ascended the stairs, still thinking. When passing his brother's door, he suddenly stopped and reached out to open it. He suddenly had a strong desire to see Zhe'an immediately, to look at him for a long time, to see him unexpectedly while he was asleep, when his weariness had subsided, when the lines on his face were relaxed and resting, when all the ugliness of life had disappeared. In this way, he could grasp the secret of his face in sleep; if there were any noteworthy similarities, they would certainly not escape his eyes.</p>
<p>But if Zhe'an woke up, what would he say? How would he explain his reason for going to see him?</p>
<p>He stood still, his fingers tightly gripping the doorknob, pondering a reason, an excuse.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered that eight days ago, he had lent his brother a bottle of opium tincture for toothache (Laudanum). He could say that he himself had a toothache tonight and was going to retrieve his medicine. So he went in, walking stealthily like a pickpocket.</p>
<p>Zhe'an slept soundly with his lips slightly parted, like an animal. His golden beard and hair stained the white sheet with a golden blot. He did not wake up at all, but he stopped snoring.</p>
<p>Bier bent down, looking at him greedily. No, this young man in front of him did not resemble Roland; then he remembered again the lost small portrait of Maraisa. He had to find this portrait! Looking at that portrait, he might not doubt anymore.</p>
<p>His brother moved, certainly because he was standing in front of him, or because the light of the candle shone into his eyes and disturbed his sleep. So the doctor retreated, tiptoed to the door, and quietly closed it. Then he returned to his own room, but he did not go to sleep.</p>
<p>Dawn broke very slowly. The clock in the dining room ticked away, its sound deep and solemn, as if a large cathedral bell were hidden inside this small piece of clockwork. The sound traveled up the empty staircase, through the walls and doors, disappearing into the dull ears of the sleeping people in the room. Bier paced back and forth between his bed and the window. What should he do? He felt too agitated to spend the day in his family. He hoped to be isolated from everyone for at least one day, so that he could reflect, calm down, and gather his spirits to face the necessary return to daily life.</p>
<p>Okay! He could go to Trouville to see the crowds frolicking on the beach. This could dispel his sorrow, change his thoughts, and give him time to prepare for the terrible things he had discovered.</p>
<p>As soon as it was light, he washed and dressed. The fog had cleared, and the weather was very good. Because the boat to Trouville would not leave the pier until nine o'clock, the doctor thought he should kiss his mother before leaving.</p>
<p>He waited until her usual time to get up and went downstairs. When he reached her door, his heart was beating so hard that he had to stop and breathe. His hand resting on the lock was weak and trembling, and he barely had the strength to turn the doorknob and go into the room. He knocked on the door. His mother's voice asked:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Me, Bier."</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Because I'm going to Trouville with some friends to play for a day, I came to say goodbye to you first."</p>
<p>"But I haven't gotten up yet."</p>
<p>"Okay, then don't get up. I'll kiss you when I come back tonight."</p>

<h3 id="e197">Telegraphs Created by the Voice of the Electric Realm and the Times <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The times are enough to create heroes, and heroes are also enough to create the times; but based on the experience of the telecommunications industry, the two words "times" can indeed produce multiple views of telegrams. Therefore, it is not impossible to say that telegraphs are created by the times.</p>
<p>When the situation is peaceful and society is tranquil, the communications of officials and the military are relatively reduced. But when political affairs suddenly change and the situation suddenly becomes tense, those who want to communicate do so, those who want to denounce do so, those who want to inquire do so, and those who want to report do so. The telegram business increases accordingly; the telegraph lines become crowded accordingly. This kind of phenomenon can truly be said to be created by the times.</p>
<p>Telecommunications personnel serve the country and society. Busy telegrams are their duty, and they have no choice but to do their duty. But looking at the current situation, the whole country, from top to bottom, is trying to unite with utmost sincerity, but the changes of the times are unexpected. When we see telegrams flying around and hear the whirring of the telegraph machines, this work is non-stop all night. On the one hand, we are working hard to defend our position, and at the same time, we seem to hear the call for peace.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Comparison of New and Old International Telegraph Regulations on Plain and Cipher Language Provisions Wang Yunzhen <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams are the key to international communication and also a tool for cultural exchange. The business can only thrive if people all over the world can make full use of telegrams. But in order to achieve this goal, there must be two prerequisites: (1) That the telegraph language is not subject to any restrictions, and all countries participating in the International Telegraph Convention can use their respective national languages to send telegrams; (2) That the combination of telegram texts should be simplified and standardized, so as to calculate the number of words and facilitate transmission. Over the years, telegraph experts from various countries have paid attention to this. At each International Telegraph Conference, there have been additions and revisions to the business rules and regulations. This is because world telecommunications traffic is becoming increasingly complex, and the business rules must be revised from time to time to be applicable.</p>
<p>The current International Telegraph Business Regulations are those revised in Paris in 1925 and Beijing in 1928. Last year (1932), the International Telegraph Conference was held in Madrid, and there were many revisions to these regulations. The Ministry of Communications has translated the original book into Chinese and will soon publish it. The main differences between the new and old regulations regarding plain and cipher language telegrams are explained below:</p>
<p>(1) In the old regulations, the languages allowed to be used were limited to German, English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and Esperanto. (Chinese characters composed of four numbers are also allowed to be used.)</p>
<p>In the new regulations, in addition to the nine languages listed on the right, there are also Abyssinian, African, etc., totaling fifty-six languages. (Chinese characters are still allowed to be used.)</p>
<p>(2) In the old regulations, plain language can use letters such as AAA NOU, as well as punctuation marks (;), exclamation marks, and marks before and after the predicate (;).</p>
<p>(3) The old regulations allowed the use of cross ciphers, but there were certain restrictions on the spelling of letters. Counting words was very difficult, and because there were too many cross combinations, errors were easily made during transmission.</p>
<p>The new regulations abolish cross ciphers and only allow the use of five-letter ciphers, which are not subject to any restrictions. Counting words is easy, and errors can be reduced during transmission.</p>
<p>(4) In the old regulations, five-letter cipher telegrams started with four words, and the fee was charged at two-thirds of the full price. In the new regulations, five-letter cipher telegrams start with five words, and the fee is charged at six-tenths of the full price.</p>
<p>(5) In the old regulations, number words (not those expressed in letters) contained in five-letter cipher telegrams could not be mixed, except for those indicating trademarks or commercial marks.</p>
<p>The new regulations allow the use of number words or groups of number words in cipher telegrams, but they must not exceed half of the total number of words charged in the telegram.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the new regulations, plain language telegrams are open to as many as fifty-six national languages, and cipher language telegrams only use five-letter ciphers. The former seeks to universalize telegraph language, while the latter seeks to simplify telegraph cipher language, both of which are major improvements compared to the old regulations. People all over the world should be happy to use them. Our country is one of the member states of the International Telegraph Convention, and the revised articles in the new regulations will be implemented from January 1st of next year (the 23rd year of the Republic of China). The people of the country should pay attention to this. It is heard that the International Telecommunications Bureau has already sent an official letter to notify them.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Improvements in Telegraph Business in the Past Year (Middle) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Junxiang</p>
<p>(4) Using local telephone to send and receive telegrams According to this method, all telephone users can apply to the local telegraph office to have telegrams sent from other places transmitted by telephone, or to have telegrams sent to other places transmitted by telephone to the office for dispatch. They only need to pay a registration fee of one yuan to be valid for one year. After the telegram has been transmitted by telephone, the bottom of the telegram will still be sent to the other party on the same day for verification. This method can greatly speed up the transmission of telegrams.</p>
<p>(5) Replacing the addressee's address with a telephone number. Checking the addressee's address is not related to the content of the telegram, but it often contains lengthy words, which is not economical to charge by the word. The Ministry of Communications has established a method to replace the addressee's address with a telephone number. All addressees with a telephone can use the telephone number to replace their address, adding a "phone" character before the number to identify it. No matter how many numbers there are, they are all charged as one word. This is very economical for the sender. The above-mentioned fourth method is also a combination of telegram and telephone.</p>
<p>(6) Revising the special delivery fee method. Checking the telegram sending and receiving method originally stipulated that if the addressee's address is more than five li away from the office, a special delivery fee will be charged. However, now the roads in various cities have been improved. If it exceeds five li, a special delivery fee will be charged, which is difficult to satisfy the sender, and the messenger often uses it as an excuse to demand more money, which has an impact on the reputation of the office. The Ministry of Communications has revised the method, stipulating that if the addressee's address and the office are in the same city, no special delivery fee will be charged regardless of the distance. If they are not in the same city and the distance exceeds five li, a special delivery fee may be charged. This revision is a loss for the office and a saving for the addressee.</p>
<p>(7) Chinese telegrams can use Arabic numerals. Chinese telegrams must be translated into telegraph codes for transmission due to technical reasons. Therefore, the house number in the address and the amount of money and the quantity of goods in the telegram must be written in characters, and cannot be expressed in Arabic numerals, in order to avoid code confusion. This provision requires a lot of words. The Ministry of Communications has now approved the method of referring to foreign language telegrams, and the above-mentioned house numbers and various numbers can be written in Arabic numerals, and parentheses are placed before and after them for identification. The fee calculation method is that one to four Arabic numerals are counted as one word for plain language, and one to five Arabic numerals are counted as one word for cipher language. Parentheses are free of charge and can be used with decimal points to calculate one Arabic numeral. This method can save money for sending telegrams with numbers: for example, "No. 1123 Zhongshan Road" can be written as "No. (1123) Zhongshan Road", which can save six words; and "4399 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, 5 li" can be written as "4399.165", which can save as many as eleven words.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Significance of Recovering the Telegraph Sending and Receiving Rights of Submarine Cable Companies (Continued) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— He Shui</p>
<p>(B) Preventing unfavorable propaganda by foreigners.</p>
<p>Before the recovery of the sending and receiving rights, all incoming and outgoing telegrams were received and delivered by the Sanshui Cable Company itself, and we had no say in the matter. Therefore, foreigners in China could freely report unfavorable news to various countries, and we had no way to stop them. As a result, people in various countries were deceived by this propaganda and did not understand the true situation of our country, which led to various negative impressions of us. Now that the right to send and receive telegrams has been taken into our own hands, all telegrams must pass through our hands, which can be strictly checked. The above-mentioned unfavorable events in our country can no longer occur.</p>
<p>(C) Understanding the handling of submarine cable telegrams.</p>
<p>Since the sending and receiving of submarine cable telegrams was handled by various companies in the past, their situation was unknown. Now that all incoming and outgoing telegrams are handled by us, the business situation can be understood. Moreover, in the past, in order to develop their business and attract telegram business, various companies often handled telegram business in a way that did not comply with the International Telegraph Business Regulations. Now that the sending and receiving of telegrams is handled by us, it can be gradually corrected to ensure that the regulations are in compliance. The important significance of recovering the telegraph sending and receiving rights of the Sanshui Cable Company has been described above. What kind of understanding should people from all walks of life in Shanghai have about this matter? The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Should recognize the proper name of the three sending and receiving offices.</p>
<p>Since May 1st of this year, the organization in Shanghai that receives telegrams sent to various foreign countries via the three cable companies has been the "Telegraph Office for Cablegram via Eastern Extension Cables, Great Northern Cables, Commercial Pacific Cable, Bureau of International Telegraphs, Ministry of Communications," and not the former Eastern Extension, Great Northern, and Commercial Pacific Cable Companies. The messengers who deliver telegrams sent from various foreign countries are also the messengers of the above-mentioned three sending and receiving offices, and not the messengers of the former three companies. Since the affiliation has changed and the name has been changed, people from all walks of life in Shanghai should deeply recognize the name of "Telegraph Office for Cablegram via Eastern Extension Cables, Great Northern Cables, Commercial Pacific Cable, Bureau of International Telegraphs, Ministry of Communications" in order to respect our national sovereignty and express patriotic thoughts, and should no longer deeply imprint the names of the former Eastern Extension, Great Northern, and Commercial Pacific Companies in their minds.</p>
<p>(B) Should recognize the organizational nature of the three sending and receiving offices.</p>
<p>All the staff and messengers of the three sending and receiving offices are appointed and employed by the Ministry of Communications and have nothing to do with the former three cable companies. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Shanghai should clearly understand that the three sending and receiving offices are agencies under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, and their status is exactly the same as the International Radio Station in the Sassoon Building on Beijing Road, the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications on Sichuan Road, and the Wireless Radio Station on Minguo Road, and they are not agencies run by foreigners.</p>
<p>(C) Should recognize the current procedures for handling telegram business.</p>
<p>At present, the Eastern Extension, Great Northern, and Commercial Pacific Cable Companies have no right to handle telegram business externally. All matters related to the receipt, delivery, and inquiry of submarine cable telegrams should be handled directly by the three sending and receiving offices. In the future, if people from all walks of life have any matters related to incoming and outgoing submarine cable telegrams, they should call or write to the three sending and receiving offices to contact them, and should no longer use the names of the Eastern Extension, Great Northern, and Commercial Pacific Companies, so as to avoid various misunderstandings and delay important matters. In the past few months, the outside world has not been very clear about this situation, and many people still mistakenly use the names of the companies to contact the three sending and receiving offices, which hinders the handling of affairs and is unfavorable to the people themselves. It is hoped that people from all walks of life in Shanghai will pay close attention to this point to correct the above-mentioned errors.</p>
<p>At present, various industries in our country are striving for reform and progress. The rights that were previously seized by foreigners are also gradually being recovered. The cancellation of the direct sending and receiving of telegrams by the various cable companies and the formation of the three submarine cable telegraph sending and receiving offices are also proceeding along these lines. It is hoped that people from all walks of life in Shanghai will deeply recognize the current status and situation of the three sending and receiving offices and jointly maintain the integrity of our country's telecommunications sovereignty. This is not only the good fortune of the telecommunications administration, but also the glory of the country. As for the staff of the three sending and receiving offices, they should work hard according to the regulations. At the very least, they must maintain the efficiency of the company era in the past, and further strive for various improvements, so as to fulfill their duty to serve the public and live up to the earnest expectations of all parties.</p>
<p>(Note) The Chinese and Western names of the three submarine cable telegraph sending and receiving offices</p>

<h3 id="e201">Welcome Marconi, the Inventor of Wireless Radio A Telecommunications Reporter <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The fame of Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of wireless radio, is as widespread as the dissemination of wireless radio around the world, and is almost known to every woman and child. The Century of Progress International Exposition held in Chicago, USA this year officially designated October 2 as Marconi Day. On this day, Marconi performed at the meeting and sent the S signal, which was transmitted around the world and returned to its original location in about one minute. This S signal is the symbol that Marconi used to communicate across the Atlantic with Newfoundland in the United Kingdom in late 1901.</p>
<p>Many people from all walks of life know about Marconi's history, and it has also been published in recent maritime newspapers, so there is no need to repeat it. In short, Marconi studied and invented in the laboratory as a student, making wireless radio a powerful tool for communication, benefiting both military and civilian use. His contribution to human welfare is second to none among modern inventors.</p>
<p>Now Marconi has actually traveled across the ocean to visit China. Although our country's wireless business is still in its infancy, it has been planned and operated by the transportation authorities and our country's experts. International long-distance communication has now taken shape. With the guidance of advanced experts, the development of the business is even more promising. When people in our telecommunications industry hear this news, they sincerely welcome Marconi, the inventor of wireless radio.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Telecommunications Talks Telephone丨Automatic Watch丨Dialing the Number Plate丨First Serve as a Driver <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The telephone is called "automatic," but the machine itself is not actually automatic. Everything still has to be commanded by people to initiate action. Therefore, the word "automatic" means that the user operates the connection himself, so it is different from the ordinary use of a telephone that requires a driver.</p>
<p>Working together</p>
<p>The telephone does not require a driver, so the driver's duties are transferred to the user himself. When the earpiece is in hand, the fingertip is inserted into the number plate and rotated, going back and forth, turning smoothly. During this short period of time, the user is not a user, but actually a telephone driver. When the conversation can be heard and the language has reached, the earpiece is gently placed down and the person is also away. At this moment, the user is not a user, but also a telephone driver (because after the phone is placed on the hook, the related components inside the telephone exchange immediately return to normal, as if the driver has disconnected the line).</p>
<p>Since the user also serves as a driver, how does he drive? How does he connect? This is what the reader wants to know (this is for general users who know how to use the machine but do not know the mechanical situation). First, a brief explanation of the number plate on the phone is given.</p>
<p>When using the telephone for the first time, pick up the earpiece. At this time, the user's line has been connected to the telephone exchange, and a buzzing sound can be heard. The buzzing sound is called "dial tone" in telephone terminology. Since it is "dial tone," you can dial the number with confidence. So dial the number plate with confidence (if there is no buzzing sound, it means that there is no "dial tone," which means that the line is blocked or there is no free line).</p>
<p>The appearance of the plate and its contents are shown in the attached picture. Those who are used to it will recognize it at a glance. The main part inside the plate is a spring that can extend and release. Due to its rotational force, it causes the electrical key that is connected to it to open and close the current. This current is like the pulse of a human body. The number of times is the same as the number dialed, and the speed is controlled by the internal rotary wheel. Each time the number plate is rotated to the limit, the finger is released, and the plate also rotates back. At this time, the pulse current continues to fluctuate, flowing into the telephone exchange equipment, and the mechanical action completes the connection procedure between the two parties. In this way, is the user not a driver? The user is indeed a driver.</p>
<p>It is quite beneficial to consider that the user also serves as a driver in social use. First, by connecting the lines yourself, as long as the number is dialed correctly, the user being called is not on the phone, and there is no one who cannot be connected correctly. Second, in places where people from all walks of life gather and speak different languages, the driver often mishears the reported number, resulting in incorrect connections, or the user being called is busy, and the user mistakenly believes that the driver is intentionally delaying the connection. All of these can be directly understood without the need for explanation (the mechanical benefits are not discussed here). This is why the users of the Capital Telephone Bureau have found it extremely convenient since the installation of automatic telephones, and the telephones run by the Ministry of Communications, such as those in Shanghai and Wuhan, have also been renovated to install automatic telephones (the mechanical situation inside the bureau will be discussed in the next issue).</p>
<h3 id="e203">Advertisement Telegrams in Germany <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>A few years ago, Germany added the distribution of telegrams (TM) to its domestic telegram business. Because the fees were still cheap, the business community used it as a promotional tool for sales. Later, they felt that there was a need for a special telegram to facilitate advertising. The fees for this telegram should be low, and the delivery location should not be limited to one corner.</p>
<p>The German telecommunications authorities are well aware of the urgency of this need and have now created what is called an advertisement telegram in their domestic business. Its nature is a slow telegram, and the number of copies is stipulated to be at least one thousand. The number of words in each telegram must not exceed one hundred, and the delivery address can be the same or different.</p>
<p>The bottom of this telegram should be marked with the delivery address and delivered to the sending and receiving office two days (working days) before the expected delivery date. At the same time, the sender should make a copy for each addressee, and the telegraph bureau will provide the required copy paper free of charge. The telegraph bureau will then deliver these copies as letter telegrams.</p>
<p>The fees to be charged for advertisement telegrams:</p>
<p>(A) Five pfennigs per word for the bottom of the telegram</p>
<p>(B) Ten pfennigs for each copy, regardless of the number of words</p>
<p>(C) If the addressee's address is not in the same location as the sending office, an additional one pfennig per copy will be charged</p>
<p>(However, at least five pfennigs should be paid for each different location)</p>
<p>For example, the number of words for which the bottom of an advertisement telegram should be charged is:</p>
<p>3 (address) + 50 (text) + 3 (signature) ▲ 56</p>
<h3 id="e204">Telegraph Inquiry Guidelines <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Z&gt; Qinghua</p>
<p>(I) Guidelines for Recipients Inquiring About Telegrams</p>
<p>3.  If a telegram has not been delivered to the recipient, and the sender notifies them that a telegram was sent on a certain day, but the telegraph office has not delivered it, the recipient should first inquire with the telegraph office to see if a telegram arrived on that day. If the office has not received it, then the telegram must have been missed by an intermediate office or not sent by the originating office. The recipient should notify the sender to take the original telegraph receipt to the originating office for inquiry. If the inquiry confirms that the telegram was missed, not forwarded, or not delivered due to an error by the telegraph office, the sender can request a full refund of the telegraph fee from the originating office.</p>
<p>4.  Telegram Delay: If the recipient receives a telegram and discovers that it arrived late (the date and time noted at the top of the telegram form indicate when the sender submitted the telegram, which can be compared with the time of receipt to determine if there was a delay. The permissible delay time for domestic telegrams is generally the same as postal delivery, unless otherwise specified for international telegrams). The recipient can take the telegram to the telegraph office to inquire about the cause of the delay. If the delay was due to line problems, congestion, or being held up by military censors, the telegraph fee cannot be refunded. However, if the delay was due to negligence on the part of the telegraph office, the recipient can send the telegram to the sender to request a refund of the telegraph fee from the originating office.</p>
<p>5.  Inquiring About the Sender's Name: Sometimes, the recipient receives a telegram without the sender's signature, making it impossible to know who sent it. The recipient can take the telegram to the telegraph office and request a paid public telegram to inquire about the sender's name. In addition to the six-character fee for the telegram itself, a prepaid reply fee of four or five characters is also required. For clarity in calculating the fees, examples of paid public telegrams are provided below:</p>
<p>(I) The outgoing paid public telegram is calculated as six characters:</p>
<p>=RCX= 645 Sixteenth Smith SenderssNamc</p>
<p>Paid identification, i.e., telegram number, telegram date, telegram recipient's name, please inquire about the sender's name, prepaid reply fee.</p>
<p>(II) The incoming paid public telegram is calculated as four characters:</p>
<p>I26 Seventeenth Srrith John</p>
<p>Outgoing telegram number, outgoing telegram date, original telegram recipient's name, original telegram sender's name.</p>
<p>6.  Inquiring About Errors in the Name of the Originating Office: The foreign place name written in the "Originating Office Name" field at the top of the telegram form indicates where the telegram was sent from. Sometimes this place name may be transmitted incorrectly by the telegraph office, such as "Cangzhou" being mistaken for "Cangkou." In such cases, the recipient, upon receiving the telegram, may suspect that the sender has moved to a certain place. For the sake of caution, the recipient can take the telegram to the telegraph office and use a paid public telegram to inquire about the name of the originating office. If the inquiry confirms that the error was made by the telegraph office, the prepaid fee for the outgoing and incoming paid public telegrams can be fully refunded. If there is no error, the fee cannot be refunded. 7. Requesting Telegrams to be Forwarded Elsewhere: Sometimes, the recipient anticipates a telegram to be sent to them at a certain location, but due to urgent matters, they need to travel elsewhere. To avoid the telegram being undeliverable or delayed, they can submit a letter to the telegraph office requesting that their telegrams be forwarded to the location they will be traveling to. However, they must prove that they are the intended recipient (to prevent others from fraudulently receiving telegrams) and be responsible for the forwarding fee.</p>
<p>7.  Incorrect Telegram Delivery: Sometimes, telegrams are delivered incorrectly due to unclear addresses, similar business names, or negligence on the part of the telegraph office messenger. If the recipient discovers that the telegram is not intended for them, they should immediately return it to the telegraph office or notify the telegraph office by phone to have a messenger collect it for immediate redelivery. Do not forward it yourself to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>8.  Incorrect Telegram Date: If the recipient receives a telegram and suspects that the original telegram's sent date may be incorrect, or if the telegram's content is related to the original telegram's date (e.g., "Departing tomorrow"), they can take the telegram to the telegraph office and send a paid public telegram to inquire. If the inquiry confirms that the error was made by the telegraph office, the fee for the paid public telegram can be fully refunded.</p>
<p>9.  Omissions in Telegram Translation: According to regulations, the telegraph office should translate the telegram's code into text. If there are omissions in the translation or requests for translation fees, the recipient can send the telegram to the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation in Nanjing to request an investigation and have the responsible personnel at the telegraph office punished.</p>
<p>10. Procedures for Sending Prepaid Reply Telegrams: If the characters "RPX" (indicating a prepaid reply fee) appear before the recipient's place name or name in the telegram, the receiving office will attach a prepaid reply fee voucher when delivering the telegram. The recipient can use this voucher to send a reply telegram. If the fee for the reply telegram exceeds the prepaid amount, the sender of the reply telegram must pay the difference. If the fee is less than the prepaid amount, the recipient can ask the telegraph office for a note stating the remaining unused amount, which the recipient can send to the sender to request a refund from the originating office (unused amounts below 40 cents for domestic telegrams or 2 gold francs for international telegrams cannot be refunded).</p>
<p>If three hundred copies are sent locally, and seven hundred copies are sent to other locations, the total cost will be 309.66 marks, averaging approximately 0.26 marks per copy (equivalent to about 30 cents in Chinese currency).</p>
<p>Merchants who spend this small amount and gain the assistance of telegraphic power can certainly achieve their advertising goals.</p>
<p>Ordinary printed advertisements can be recognized at a glance, and recipients often throw them into the wastebasket. However, using the above method, every recipient who receives a telegram will undoubtedly open and read it.</p>
<h3 id="e205">News from the Semi-Monthly News Agency <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>New International Telegraph Regulations to Take Effect on New Year's Day: The International Telegraph Regulations were amended at the International Telegraph Conference in Kyoto, Madrid last year. Among them, the regulations on telegraph fees, such as express telegrams being charged twice the rate of ordinary telegrams, have been implemented since April 1 of this year. Other changes regarding the method for coded telegrams will be implemented from New Year's Day next year. These measures are extremely important. The following is a summary for merchants' reference.</p>
<p>1.  The old "Class A" code words (i.e., code words consisting of ten letters) are abolished.</p>
<p>2.  Each code word is limited to five letters. The method of composition is unrestricted except that accented letters are not allowed. The presence or absence of vowel letters in each word is optional.</p>
<p>3.  Coded telegrams are charged at 60% of the full rate telegram fee (domestic telegrams are still charged at the full rate). Each telegram is calculated with a minimum of five words.</p>
<p>4.  The recipient's name, address, and the sender's signature within the coded telegram are still calculated as one word for every fifteen letters.</p>
<p>The First Draft of the National Language Telegraph Compilation is Completed and Under Review: The Ministry of Transportation, in order to promote the use of the National Language in telegrams, specially appointed Chen Yiyu and Qiu Wenbing to compile a National Language Telegraph Compilation. After several months, the first draft has now been completed. However, for the sake of prudence, the Ministry recently sent Chen Yiyu to Beiping with the first draft to be reviewed by the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee in order to perfect it. Once the review is completed, it will be ready for implementation.</p>
<p>Temporary Telegraph Stations Established in Disaster Areas: Recently, in order to facilitate communication in the Yellow River flood disaster area and to facilitate relief work, the Ministry of Transportation has established telegraph stations in Kaifeng, Lanfeng, Changyuan, Xiaopangzhuang, and other places, and has dispatched many telegraph operators to work in these locations.</p>
<p>Capital Pilot Program for Receiving Telegrams via Telephone: In large metropolitan areas with vast territories, although telegraph offices and radio stations have several branches and receiving/sending points, the public still finds it laborious to send telegrams. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation, in imitation of the method used by commercial telegraph companies in the United States, has formulated a method for notifying recipients by telephone. It has ordered the Nanjing Telegraph Office and Radio Station to pilot this program first. If the pilot program is successful and there are no obstacles, it will gradually be promoted in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Beiping to benefit the public. The content of this method is that whenever the public sends a telegram, they can notify the telegraph office or radio station by telephone to send personnel to their residence to collect the telegram and fee, so that the telegram can be sent without leaving their home, and no additional service fee will be charged.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Skimping on Work and Materials <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Relying on the mountain when living by the mountain, relying on the sea when living by the sea, so every trade, ancient and modern, high and low, knows the trick of "skimping on work and materials," and euphemistically calls it, "Every trade produces an expert."</p>
<p>Now, let's take a clear and common example. Suppose you want to make a long gown, naturally you should consult a tailor. Then the tailor will have to play tricks on you. Even if you are very shrewd, and you have 12.5 feet of fabric and want him to make a long gown of 3.9 feet, you think you won't be cheated. But the tailor will relentlessly iron your 11.5 feet into 13 feet, cut off half a foot, and sell it to a scrap shop. If the scorching iron cannot save the day, then at the very least, he will steal 3 or 4 inches to make children's shoe material. As for the stitching, naturally he will use the "paste-lifting principle," even if he can save three or five stitches, it's good, because it saves three or five stitches' worth of time.</p>
<p>However, you can skimp as much as you want. No matter what, you can't skimp so much that the seams split open after only an inch or three stitches when you put it on. You can reduce materials as much as you want, but you can't reduce so much that a 3.9-foot gown is only 3.8 feet, and the customer grabs you by the collar and gives you a big slap in the face. Naturally, there has to be a limit to skimping on work and materials. You have to consider the advantages and disadvantages, and think before you act. Otherwise, you'll not only have your old signboard smashed, but you'll probably never have another customer come to your door. Only by skimping on work and materials just right can you gain both fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Cats can't help but love the smell of fish, and black eyes can't help but light up at the sight of silver. So, no matter what business you're in, making a little extra on the side is excusable in heaven and earth. Because those who are upright and poor are outdated and no longer worth promoting. But then again, you also have to put on a show when you make extra money, to deceive the world. If you only care about the substance and not the appearance, and play a set of "Prime Minister Hefei makes the empire thin," then you're not skilled enough to be considered an expert at "skimping on work and materials."</p>
<h3 id="e207">Nostalgia <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>The mood of a young man is brave, active, and desperate, pursuing the future, because the magical "hope" is enticing him, beckoning to him, and he can't help but shout forward, go crazy, and try to catch up with it – hope! The old man is already exhausted, "hope" has abandoned him in the boundless desert and fled far away. So he feels lonely and isolated. What else can he do but savor the fragments of his past life's journey, which are relatively meaningful? What else can he ask for? However, I, who am not old and can sometimes mingle in the ranks of the young, am also disheartened, unenterprising, and disgusted with reality, and I begin to savor the past that has long disappeared.</p>
<p>In fact, in the short, ordinary course of my past life, there are indeed some thought-provoking impressions left. The most profound of these impressions, and the one that I feel I can never erase, is the scene from my childhood when I was studying in my hometown of Nanyan.</p>
<p>Nanyan has eight scenic spots. Among the eight scenic spots, "One Drop Spring" and "Five-Level Peak" are the most famous, followed by "Kaijian Pond" and "Zhuoying Well." The remaining four scenic spots were probably named by later generations' fanciful ideas, and newcomers to this place are at a loss. Here is a dome-shaped stone chamber that can hold thousands of people. On the left side of the cave entrance, there is a nipple-like overhanging stone from which clear spring water drips all year round. This is "One Drop Spring." The mountain range gently extends from the side of the cave, then turns towards the front of the cave and rises steeply, dividing into five levels that gradually rise higher. This is what I call "Five-Level Peak." The cave is surrounded by mountains on all sides. You can't see the cave at all unless you're at the foot of Five-Level Peak. Because Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan of the Song Dynasty once lectured here, it shares a bit of historical fame with White Deer Cave under the Five Old Men Peak of Mount Lu.</p>
<p>Two majestic and spacious buildings were built inside the cave. The one on the right is a Buddhist hall for Sakyamuni and the like, and the one on the left is the Zhu Wengong Ancestral Hall, which is our school. Because the school's management is lax, studying and playing are as casual as can be. When we don't feel like going to class, we invite our classmates to climb Five-Level Peak or fish in Kaijian Pond. At night, the crystal clear moon shines diagonally on the lush and dense bamboo, penetrating the grass courtyard in front of the cave like duckweed on the surface of a calm lake. We sit, stand, talk, laugh, and perform boxing. Sometimes, we sing at the top of our lungs, and the valleys give us long echoes, and the birds are startled and chirp in response. How can those who are confined in cities full of tension imagine these carefree, happy, and natural lives?</p>
<p>"Hope" for me is like a drowning man seeking light and a way out at the bottom of the water. The more desperately I pursue it, the less light there is, and the more it's a dead end. Only this fragmentary, unadulterated life of the past is worth savoring and counts as a golden page in my life's history. Is it possible to have it again in this life?</p>

<p>The cries of "Old goods for cash" and "Are there cages for sale?" happen to be answered and echoed by the scolding of the Jiangbei housewife, and they are the only great contributors to breaking the alley's silence.</p>
<p>Many children, who are not in school because it's a holiday, surround a food vendor that has a speculative nature, arguing, "I'll bet on old Bao Si!" "I'll bet on six!"</p>

<p>— Gao Yahun</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of strange and wonderful things. As the saying goes, "Turtles, thieves, and robbers, as long as money is involved," so the methods of making money are conceived so miraculously that they are incomprehensible. Recently, Russian girls often come and go in the offices of large foreign-style buildings everywhere. Some hold a paper box or leather suitcase in their hands, containing some items that can be sold. Some pretend to be mentally ill, staring blankly ahead without saying a word. They enter the office after hearing that someone is inside, and leave after taking a look, closing the door behind them. If no one is there, or only the tea boy on duty, they use their clever skills to make objects placed on the desk or in drawers disappear. This is especially true on Saturday afternoons or Sundays, because at this time, the managers and staff of the offices are on holiday and their footsteps are not seen in the offices. The only ones left are a group of junior clerks and servants. These people are rarely in contact with outsiders. Seeing a member of the opposite sex, they are as surprised and happy as Napoleon discovering a new continent. Moreover, when a foreign member of the opposite sex is present, with the senior staff not around to restrain them, who wouldn't want to take advantage of the situation and use their still-unskilled English to strike up a conversation? This is their opportunity. Sometimes, they get so confused that they lose things without even knowing it. This terrifying and amazing theft technique makes one admire your profundity!</p>

<p>But he ignored this, dusted off his clothes, took off his hat, nodded to Guizhi, and said, "Miss, you should go back. I don't want to go to Haitian Street, so I won't see you off anymore." After speaking, he turned around and walked back towards the road to Beiping. As he walked away, his face naturally carried a faint smile. But that smile was forced out, and she guessed that his heart was extremely unhappy. She couldn't go up and stop him to explain, so she had to let it go. She stood on the street for a while, feeling dejected, and walked home. Jiang saw that her daughter had an unhappy expression when she entered the house, and was very surprised, so she asked, "You stayed at the Huang's house for three days?" Guizhi saw that her mother was paying close attention to her, and immediately smiled and said, "They were desperately pulling me back, not letting me leave. Otherwise, I would have returned early yesterday morning." Jiang said, "The Huang's daughter's in-laws, are they not very sad?" Guizhi said, "Their family are people who muddle through their jobs, and they take such things as going out very normally. Besides, Company Commander Tian is still their daughter's unmarried son-in-law. They seem very indifferent." Jiang said, "What you said is not entirely unreasonable. Does that mean that an unmarried son-in-law should not be taken to heart? I am not like that." Guizhi smiled, "My dear mother, don't take it to heart. I'm not talking about you." Saying that, she went back inside the house with a smile and went back to doing her usual work. Jiang looked at this situation and couldn't guess what was going on. Actually, at this time, Guizhi was not thinking about Zhao Ziqiang, who had joined the army, but was thinking about Gan Jizhi, who had left in disappointment. She secretly pondered to herself that she unintentionally mentioned the place of the Great Red Gate, and the old man had heard it. The old man said that he was going to the Great Red Gate, so he must have told Gan Jizhi this. (256)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3 id="e212">No Freedom in Diet <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Most of those soaring in the sky piloting airplanes are smokers, and many of them are "old smoking guns," smoking a lot. This is very dangerous. Authorities in the aviation world have instructed us that smoking is the worst thing a pilot can do, because smoking often dries out their throats. When a pilot rapidly descends from a very high altitude, the sudden change in pressure is drastic and difficult to endure. This situation is enough to make his entire head feel strange and start to ring, causing him to become dizzy. The only way to avoid this unpleasant problem is to constantly swallow saliva, because the action of swallowing can open the tubes that run from the back of the throat to the eardrums.</p>
<p>Therefore, the instructors at British flight training schools advise general pilots to constantly chew spearmint gum (commonly known as chewing gum, Western name Chew Gum). Chewing spearmint gum can keep the throat moist and make it easier to swallow saliva. Spearmint gum is not a necessary food, but pilots have to chew it to avoid danger. This reminds me of a fact that people don't pay much attention to.</p>
<p>That fact is that there is no freedom in diet. Everyone knows that people have absolute freedom in diet, but that's not entirely true. Diet is like speech, and in certain special circumstances, it cannot be completely free. For example, the nutrients contained in the food we eat every day must be balanced and complete. Protein, carbohydrates, fats, starches, vitamins, and other elements are indispensable. If one element is missing, it will cause a difficult-to-treat disease. This is scientific proof that diet is not completely free. We can also get some evidence from customs. For example, Shandong people must eat garlic with every meal, Sichuan people must add chili peppers to every dish, Annamites often chew betel nuts, and Mongolians must eat dairy products. Once these commonly eaten foods are forbidden, they will feel uncomfortable all over and even get sick. Furthermore, people who are sick must have all food items approved by a doctor before they can eat them. This means there is absolutely no freedom in diet. The Chinese people pay great attention to the color, aroma, and taste of food, but not so much to the quality, composition, and nutrition. So, except in certain special circumstances, the Chinese people's diet can be said to be very free. The Western people are not like that. In many factories and occupations, certain foods are considered particularly valuable, certain laborers must have a special food, and some are even forced to drink "milk cocoa." Which is more beneficial, absolute freedom in diet or not completely free? That needs to be determined by experts, we dare not say rashly.</p>
<p>That certain foods are particularly valuable for certain occupations is not just empty talk, there is indeed evidence. For example, the food that loggers living in the northwestern part of England rely on for a living is mostly pork and beans. These loggers do very hard work in cold climates, and the energy they expend must be replenished by their food. So they eat pork and beans, because apart from these two things, there is no mixed food that can generate more heat and muscle. Loggers also eat large amounts of bannock, a thick, flat cake simmered in syrup. The syrup has been experimentally shown to contain pure sugar, almost 100% carbohydrates, and carbohydrates are what produce heat. People who work with their brains should often eat white fish. As people used to think, white fish provides phosphorus that nourishes the brain. This view is absurd and unbelievable, but fish is very suitable for people in sedentary occupations and lives, because fish provides a rich and abundant quality of meat, Western name Butchers Meat, which digests quickly and easily. People who work with their brains should take fish as their main food.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Financial Exchange Closing Suddenly Contracts, Gold Price Recovers 1.9 Yuan; U.S. Market Closed on the 30th, Gold Price Fluctuates Slightly, This Month's Notes Settled at 730 Yuan <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>After the gold market declined the previous day, it stabilized slightly yesterday. With the U.S. market closed on the 30th, the market was extremely calm. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw London holding steady while the U.S. rose. Forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange rose by amounts ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 percent. Exchange rates opened higher but contracted. London spot gold rose by 1 penny, and the U.S. official buying price rose by 8 cents, to $33.93. U.S. cotton rose by 7 points, U.S. wheat rose by 1.625 points, and stocks rose by $1.91. The wool market opened at 0.078 yuan higher, but due to increased supply at higher prices from firms like Tong Tai Chang, the market weakened. After opening, it was flat. When it became known that HSBC was posting London steady while the U.S. was contracting by 0.25, the market showed firmness. The domestic market also tightened, and the gold market rose accordingly. People were uncertain and many took the opportunity to sell. Other firms continued to offer, and the exchange market became sluggish again. Western firms like Carlowitz also sold, and the situation slightly deteriorated. The outlook became even more dull, with fluctuations of less than 1 yuan throughout the morning, and the market was extremely quiet. Because the U.S. was on holiday on the 30th, there were no reports from the U.S. market, and both buyers and sellers were taking a wait-and-see approach. Reuters reported that the Agricultural Bureau had announced that farmers who reduced their cotton acreage next year would receive awards and subsidies. As a result, the market seemed weak in the first half but was then affected by the news that a meeting between the U.S. President and Black, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, had yielded no results. The President's statement that gold purchasing prices might not be announced daily had no impact. The spot price was 1,085 yuan, with little price difference throughout the day. The market situation is described below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 705.5 yuan, up 1.2 yuan from the previous closing. Goods opened at 5.2 yuan. Exchange rates opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 3125 points, and U.S. exchange at 33.5 yuan. Heng Tai, Bing Xing, Da De Cheng, Ri Chang, and others sold, lowering the price to 4.7 yuan. Gen. Wah Bi Lian bought U.S. dollars for March at 4375 points. Heng Yu, Yuan Chun, and Yong Feng advanced to 6 yuan. Da De Cheng and Tong Tai Chang sold. Zheng Jin came out with U.S. dollars for March at 4375 points, then lowered the price to 4.8 yuan. However, because Hong Li, Heng Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and others bought at low prices, the situation was very stable. When it became known that HSBC was posting London steady while the U.S. was contracting by 0.25, there was a rush to buy. Qian Chang Xiang, Fu Yu, Tong Tai Chang, Heng Yu, and others worked hard on notes, and the price rose to around 8 yuan. But the situation was still volatile. Zheng Jin then bought U.S. dollars for April at 5625 points and for March at 3125 points. Da Xing Yong bought aggressively, and the price rose to 8.9 yuan, but others sold, weakening the market. Afterwards, U.S. dollars for March at 3125 points were difficult to sell. Shun Li and Rui Kang sold notes. Da Xing Yong then sold again, and the price retreated to 5.6 yuan. Goods were accepted in settlement, and the market situation remained flat. After struggling, the afternoon closing was at 706.1 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 6.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was at 706.2 yuan, and goods opened at 6 yuan. Wah Bi bought April at 6875. The market was stable. Although Heng Yu, Heng Tai, and others bought, the Dalian group supplied slightly, and the price hovered around 6 yuan for a long time, with fluctuations of only a few cents. Later, Qian Chang Xiang and Yuan Chun bought notes, and Shun Li also bought, so the price rose from 5.7 yuan to 6.6 yuan. Zheng Jin continued to offer U.S. dollars for February at 1875. Yuan Mao and Zhao Feng Chang sold to 6 yuan. Wan Xing bought notes. The closing was at 706.2 yuan. After the closing, the price of goods was slightly reduced. In addition, Heng Yu, Wan Xing, and Bing Xing also sold, and the price declined. Finally, Yuan Mao and Yong Lai bought, and the price was again around 6 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 5.5 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 708.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 704.7 yuan, a difference of 4.2 yuan. As a result, the price recovered 1.9 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The price was announced because the HSBC bank posted the U.S. exchange rate contracting by 0.25, to 32.875 yuan. The standard gold price was 730 yuan. According to the closing price, the discount was about 24 yuan, more than 3 yuan higher than the previous closing. 1,225 notes for this month have been settled at 730 yuan according to today's announced price. December was booked at 712 yuan, and January at 706 yuan. The water supplement was 720 yuan in the morning and the same price in the afternoon. The spot price was 1,085 yuan. In the first half of the day, Tong Feng Yong, Da De Cheng, Ying Bao Heng, and others sold to the Tianjin group for 1,088 yuan. Later, the price gradually fell, and when it reached 1,083 yuan, the Tianjin group supplied again, which was purchased by Ying Feng Heng. The lowest price fell to 1,077 yuan. In the second half of the day, the Tianjin group sold to Da De Sheng for 1,079 yuan. Finally, the price was about 1,080 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about 4,000 taels. 4,508 notes for December are still outstanding.</p>
<p>In the market, the trading was still flat in the first half of the day and extremely dull in the second half. In total, Heng Yu, Yuan Xing Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Da Kang, Heng Xing Yuan, Da Chang Xiang, Yong De, Zhao Feng Chang, Yi He, Da Xing Yong, Hong Li, Shun Li, and others were on the buying side. Bing Xing, Rui Kang, Hui Xiang, Da De Cheng, Tian Feng, Chang Sheng Yong, Yi Yu, Fu Tai Heng, Heng Chang Yong, Ri Chang, and others were on the selling side. Heng Tai, Yuan Mao, Qian Chang Xiang, Yi Da Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Yu, Yuan Chun, and Da Fa Yong, etc., sold first and then bought. Heng Xing, Da Xing Yong, and Yong Feng bought first and then sold. The Dalian group and Shun Li traded a total of more than 2,900 notes, netting 63 notes. Gao Xing traded more than 2,000, netting 42 notes. The Guangdong group Heng Xing bought and sold more than 100 notes each. There were a total of 21,455 notes for January.</p>

There were very few transactions. At the closing, the recent selling prices were British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 3125 points, and U.S. exchange at 33.5 yuan, which was considered London steady and the U.S. tighter by 0.0125 compared to the previous closing.

<p>Yesterday was again the end of the month, and the financial world's inflow and outflow situation was generally more active than usual. However, this time, due to excessive government bond deliveries, settlements were especially numerous. The Chinese and foreign call loan market situation rose again, 0.02 higher than the previous day, calculated at 0.18. The morning and afternoon markets were the same, with additional water. Because foreign banks had outflows, funds were relatively loose, so only 0.06 to 0.07 interest rates were made. In the morning, more than 5.7 million in call loan transactions were transferred, more than 800,000 in new transactions, more than 400,000 in afternoon transactions, and more than 300,000 in transactions among small associations. Banks also settled many settlement funds, with foreign banks receiving more than 3.45 million in settlement bills, more than 4.2 million in foreign currency, more than 4.3 million in special settlement bills in both silver and foreign currency, more than 2.3 million in settlement funds, more than 3.7 to 3.8 million in foreign currency, more than 4.9 million in various commodity exchange collateral miscellaneous funds in silver, more than 6.4 million in foreign currency, 400,000 in warehouse silver, and 600,000 in foreign currency.

<p>Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign, the morning and afternoon markets were both 833 yuan, down 2.5 yuan from the previous day, and there were not many transactions, with an estimated 11,000 jiao in the morning market and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign, the morning and afternoon markets were again both 786 yuan 4 jiao, down 6 jiao from the afternoon market of the previous day, making transactions, 95,000 jiao in the morning market, 50,000 jiao in the afternoon market, and copper coins did not move, still 3 days and 5,500 yuan, and more than 36,900 strings, with a total cost of 12,100 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Securities Deliveries at the End of Last Month Were Especially Huge, Dealers Accounted for More Than 38 Million, Other Securities Dealers Also Had 10 Million Yuan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>According to people in the financial world, securities market prices rose and fell sharply last month (November), especially the current sharp drop. Cash deliveries were more frequent than in previous months. It is estimated that the total number of deliveries, in terms of the silver and money industries alone, was more than 38 million in deliveries at the exchange. The number of deliveries between other securities dealers and customers was also no less than 10 million. Therefore, the tightness or looseness of the fund position at the end of this month is beyond our expectations. The recent high call loan interest rate is related to this.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Total Call Loan Interest for November <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The foreign call loan interest rate in November was loose and sluggish at first, sitting still at a few points every day, and never went over 1 jiao. After the 20th, the situation showed a slight profit. When the Fujian Incident occurred, unexpectedly, it suddenly became tight, exceeding 1 jiao of market outlook, the market stability appeared stable, but the content was very tense. Therefore, the total call loan interest for today is 2.53 yuan, which is 0.31 yuan more than in October. Based on 30 days, 0.08423 per day, if the call loan interest rate is opened for discussion, it will probably still be deducted from 2.595.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Securities and Government Bonds Plunge to Limit Down, New Low Prices Found in Each Round, Second Tragic Plunge This Year, Notice Changed to Collect Special Certificate 600 Yuan, Bulls Have No Room to Struggle <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to rumors that fighting had broken out in Fujian and Zhejiang, the market atmosphere was extremely tense, people were extremely panicked, and the bulls had no room to struggle. Market prices plunged, followed by limit downs, the second tragic plunge of the 22nd year, and new low prices were found in each bond market. The shorts also fabricated rumors, and the bulls were afraid of the high pressure from the shorts and urgently sought a way out, so the sellers became more and more turbulent, with a downward trend. The morning opening fell sharply by 2 yuan, or at least 7 to 8 jiao. Large investors sold off, and No. 4 also sold off, so the situation was extremely bad. The second round immediately fell by more than 1 yuan, and other types also fell by another 7 to 8 jiao. Large investors continued to sell, and new low prices appeared one after another. There were about 25 million in transactions in the two rounds. The January 23 futures contract was listed for the first day and saw all open positions, and the transactions were extremely active. The afternoon opening was after 5 o'clock, and only one round was made due to time constraints. The market atmosphere was even worse before it was made. After the opening, it fell sharply again. The recent and distant futures of the layoff and the near-term of the 19th Customs Good fell by more than 4 yuan, and the limit down was announced. After the entry, the decline was slightly killed because Nos. 46 and 54 were quite replenished, but there was no sign of recovery. Such a sharp drop seemed to have triggered the unloading of physical goods, and the future situation was not easy to see recovery. As a result, market prices fell 1 to 2 yuan to 4 yuan, and the total turnover was estimated at around 35 million yuan. The exchange announced that the special certificate for futures was increased by 200 yuan per 10,000, changed to 600 yuan per 10,000, 400 yuan for gold, and 200 yuan for 96 goods.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reported that the New York stock market was firm on the 29th, influenced by rising gold prices and a weak dollar. The 30th was Thanksgiving, and the stock exchange was closed as usual, so trading was light today. Total volume was only 700,000 shares. Those holding stock were unwilling to sell unless prices rose, and buying was slightly stronger than before. Steel Century also reported that steel production is currently at 28 percent, and work exceeds household orders, reversing the seasonal trend. Due to the increase in automobile production, railway orders, and new public works plans, "wheat" rose due to Argentina. The settlement of December futures is coming to an end soon, and spot prices are becoming tighter due to government purchases, so doing more is more stable. "Cotton" fluctuated slightly due to the holiday the next day and was completely controlled by exchange rates. The dollar may stop depreciating before the government raises funds in mid-December, and spot trading is still light. The gold purchased by the Financial Aftercare Agency cost 33.93 yuan per tael, up 8 cents. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Cannot Be Contained, Recent Decline of 3.9 Yuan</p>
<h3 id="e222">New Sellers of This Month's Futures Must Pay a Special Security Deposit of 60 Yuan per Bale <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell sharply in the morning, and for a time there was an uncontrollable anger. More than 10,000 bales of yarn were delivered on the previous day, and a certain factory on the buying side had no intention of receiving the goods, so people were greatly shocked. This situation is rare in history. The authorities in the office regarded the situation as serious. For prudence, the seller must pay 52 yuan in cash and 8 yuan in lieu for the special security deposit per bale, totaling 60 yuan, to restrict the sale. However, the first round of this month fell sharply by 3.9 jiao, and the long-term also fell by 1.2 jiao. The future situation is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>There is a saying that the buyer will deduct and collect the delivered yarn. At the opening of the human bid forward market, it was said that the buyer did not accept the delivered yarn. There was much discussion on the market, and people were fearful. Each month fell 1.2 jiao to 3.7 jiao. In the afternoon, it was rumored on the market that someone was maintaining it, and those who profited made up for it, and each month rose 8 or 9 jiao to 1.6 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 54,000 bales. It was found that Fuyou sold 2,200 bales, Tongji 2,100 bales, Mingde 2,200 bales, Rongxing 4,500 bales, Senkang 1,600 bales, Changyu 1,450 bales, Dachang 1,550 bales, Taichang 1,050 bales, and Lichang 1,750 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Follows Fall by 2 Yuan In addition, the spot yarn destocking is stagnant. It was found that the statistics of the various gangs' purchases throughout the day were only 270 bales. The market fell by 2 yuan. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton is in a state of stagnation as the yarn market is broken and the current sales are dull. Factories have difficulty purchasing raw materials in large quantities, so actual sales are quite stagnant. The overseas cotton market is also showing signs of flatness. Indian cotton prices are falling daily. According to reliable sources, tens of thousands of bales of American cotton purchased by the national government will soon arrive in Shanghai. Due to the poor environment, there are rumors of cheap sales, but the general cotton merchants in the area absorb it and do not release it, and the market is on the rise.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Fell in the Morning and Recovered in the Afternoon Zheng Biao opened in the forward market, with a poor atmosphere and the bulls closing out. Each month fell by 3.4 jiao. In the afternoon, some cotton merchants increased their purchases, and each month recovered by 1.2 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 153,200 dan. It was found that Tongxing sold 2,300 bales, Yuda 5,800 dan, Jifeng 4,300 dan, Tongfu 3,000 dan, Dafeng 8,800 dan, Rongxing 4,500 dan, Changfeng 10,200 dan, and Changhe 4,700 dan.

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs totaled more than 80 households (over 10,000 stones). The sales of late rice, the early market sold out, only the Tianjin gang slightly moved, the market outlook was more decadent than before, and fortunately the Nanyang Fuzhou gang, which had been suspended for a long time, suddenly took action, the people's hearts were slightly peaceful, and the Qingdao Yantai and other gangs also took action one after another, and the current situation was slightly improved. However, the households screened extremely strictly and took all high-quality goods, the middle and second grades suddenly became stagnant, and as a result, the north and south foreign gangs jointly entered five or six thousand bags (more than 7,000 stones), all of which belonged to special large markets, and the number of middle and second grades was very few, and the market ended up through several storms, slightly repairing half a foot of the number, and to the various gangs of thick japonica rice and Du Yangjian, which were absorbed by the zero stomach, the arrival and sales were balanced, the Yin Yuan wine households were slightly active, and also turned flat, the sales of the variable Yuan were not wide, and the market was still weak, (Shanghai North) The ships arriving from various gangs were quite prosperous, about 70 households, and the destocking of various types in the market was very weak. The market outlook for new japonica rice, white Yuan, and Yin Hua prices was 1 jiao lower, and the price of Yang Du Bu Jian was several cents lower. Early thin rice was stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the customer's Xiang rice market was in a flat and soft situation. Since the Fujian Incident, this customer's sales have been sluggish, and the inventory has gradually increased, and after the price increase at the beginning of last month, it has attracted customers and vendors to transport it to Shanghai. Once the many arrivals were available, the Fujian gang stopped, and the market turned straight down. Yesterday, the Fujian Provincial Capital Gang and the Xiamen Quanzhou Gang of the province started to sell smoothly, and the market outlook was extremely lively. The people's hearts were already optimistic, and the market immediately rose, and the Provincial Capital Gang started a trial of more than 700 bags of Hunan Jiangxi machine brown rice, Xiamen was safe locally, and continued to handle nearly 1,000 bags, and Quanzhou also handled 200 bags, a total of about 2,000 bags. Ningbo also handled 200 bags of machine early rice, and this street also handled more than 500 bags of millet and Yuan rice. Once the long-stagnant and abandoned market was resumed by the Fujian gang, the market immediately changed, and all rice was nearly 1 jiao better than the previous market.</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday was the November futures flour delivery day. The total delivery volume for the day was 73,000 bags, including 45,000 bags of "Yuan Mai Gen," 22,000 bags of "Green Cannon," 2,000 bags of "Green Phoenix," 2,000 bags of "Green Three Stars," and 2,000 bags of "Red and Blue Car." Approximately one-third of these warehouse receipts were from local merchants, and two-thirds from customers. However, most of them were returned goods because the price difference between November and December was minimal, and hedging positions could not be maintained, so they were all delivered, it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday was the futures wheat delivery day. The total quantity was 32 truckloads, including 4 truckloads of No. 4, 10 truckloads of No. 8, a small truckload of No. 24, 7 truckloads of No. 21, and 5 truckloads of No. 2005. The recipients included No. 6 with 27 truckloads, No. 23 with 1 truckload, No. 21 with 2 truckloads, and No. 36 with 2 truckloads. It is said that the actual delivery was over 20 truckloads, because manufacturers had already collected some wheat beforehand, and the two sides settled for a difference of more than 10 truckloads. Regarding the future market, as domestic wheat gradually declines, it is feared that prices will rise. The only concern is the import of foreign wheat.</p>

<p>The market for Jiangdou had been sluggish due to sparse sales and abundant supply. Large-grain beans had fallen to within the three-yuan range, with few inquiries. Recently, exports to Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Yantai, and other regions have been particularly strong, and dealers have taken the opportunity to tighten supplies. Furthermore, purchases from Singapore have boosted confidence, and prices have risen sharply. Yesterday, 147 bags of small-grain Zhenjiang beans were sold at a price of 3.20 yuan, more than half a yuan higher than the lowest price.</p>

<p>New York Tea Sales: Tea consumption has an important position. In recent years, due to the impact of global instability, tea trade in various countries has also plummeted. Since President Roosevelt implemented the recovery economic plan, the United States' foreign trade has advanced by leaps and bounds, and tea sales have also shown a slight improvement due to market prosperity. According to reports, New York tea sales in November averaged 150,000 pounds per day, of which Indian tea accounted for the largest proportion, while Chinese pearl tea also had a very active market. Therefore, the tea industry has a good interest in the future trend of the tea market, it is said.</p>

<p>The arrival of new white tung oil in Hankou is gradually increasing, but transactions by foreign firms remain scarce. According to detailed reports from Hankou, merchants opened transactions for 300-400 dan of Xiangyang tung oil at a price of 19.70-19.80 yuan, and 500-600 dan of Southern Branch tung oil at 19.50-19.60 yuan, both inclusive of tax and commission. It is said that foreign firms sold more than 100 tons at 24.30 yuan, foreign commission included. However, because various foreign firms wanted to break the 24-yuan barrier, sellers were unwilling, resulting in no transaction. The shipment of Zhejiang tung oil has been strong, and coupled with the recent turbulent situation, financial pressure has increased, and the market has become increasingly weak. In the Jinlan area, current oil has fallen to 19.40-19.50 yuan, so Hangzhou merchants are only selling in Shanghai at 20.05-20.06 yuan. However, due to recent shipping inconveniences, the railway bureau's freight cars are being used for other purposes, sometimes available and sometimes not, resulting in the current oil being shipped from Hangzhou to Shanghai not arriving as scheduled, and the spot market in Shanghai is not very abundant either.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trading of woolens mainly took place among local merchants. There were considerable transactions in both thick and thin fabrics, while sales to outside customers were very quiet. Except for small-scale additions by merchants from Xiangyang Road, there were few inquiries from other merchants from Sichuan and northern areas, southern China, and the Yangtze River region. There were no orders for thin fabrics such as "Biji," "Huate" woolens, "Zhigung" flannel, or thick fabrics such as "Melton," "Pinghou" woolens, overcoating fabrics, leopard-skin wool, tiger wool, or camel wool. This is mainly due to the tight financial situation, currency exchange issues, and the lateness of the season, as well as the unrest in various regions. It is predicted that the peak sales season for regions such as Chongqing and Chengdu will be around the time of the lunar new year.</p>

Yesterday, enamel factories and thermos factories all made transactions, with a total of over 1,000 dan sold, according to records. However, inventory is low, and confidence is good, so prices have remained stable in this sluggish market, selling for 11.70 yuan per dan. Other sizes, such as 3-foot by 6-foot 13-gauge to 3-gauge patterned sheets, have not seen any transactions, so prices have remained unchanged, still at 10.60-10.70 yuan per dan, slightly lower than before, by one or two jiao, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e233">The Class of the "Qingke" (Literary Retainers) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>A "qingke" is not a profession in itself, yet in China, there are those who make it their profession; the "muke" (private secretaries) of the past were like this. The cultivation of this custom probably occurred during the feudal era. Generally, declining literati, unable to establish themselves independently as officials or magistrates, and unwilling to languish at home with their wives until old age, would, after tiring of sitting on the sidelines, seek a chance to advance. Thus, they had no choice but to rely on the patronage of powerful families, serving as "qingke." The lives of these individuals depended on catering to their masters' wishes, stirring up trouble, and adding fuel to the flames to sustain their parasitic existence. To outsiders, their situation seemed pitiable, but these individuals were often pleased with themselves and even boasted about it, which reveals their character.</p>
<p>The purpose of being a "qingke" is to amuse others, or in other words, to provide entertainment. Their individuality is lost in the environment, so they cannot act independently in anything, to show that they are independently born people. Instead, they follow the commands of others, seeking to obtain a little leftover for their satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, the term "amuse" is difficult to define. First, one must understand the personality of others; second, one must possess some talent to be slick, skilled and all things to all men. Otherwise, they will inevitably flatter someone but end up putting their foot in it.</p>
<p>I once read Liang Zhangju's "Gui Tian Suo Ji," which contains a section on "qingke," saying, "There are many 'qingke' in the capital, but they must also possess some talent and character to be able to support themselves. Some have compiled a ten-character formula: 'First-rate calligraphy, second-rate talent, three-jin wine capacity, four seasons of clothing, five-man weiqi game, six acts of Kunqu opera, seven-character crooked poems, eight hands of mahjong, ninth-rank official title, and ten parts amiability.'" In just a few dozen words, a vivid portrait of a "qingke" is drawn, which can be called concise and comprehensive. However, Liang's discussion refers to the "qingke" of that time, so it is slightly different from the current situation. If one wants to paint a portrait of a modern "qingke," it should be changed to: "A thick face, two facades, three slogans, four seasons of clothing, five cards of poker, six acts of Peking opera, seven-word proclamations, eight rounds of mahjong, nine committee positions, and ten parts amiability." And the scope of activities has also expanded slightly with the times. For example, in the event of an accident, they issue telegrams and distribute leaflets; at gatherings, they serve as representatives and compete for committee positions; when important people come and go, they hold small flags to welcome and send them off at the dock; when wealthy people or their wives die, they handle the funeral arrangements, etc. No matter how trivial the matter, once it falls into their hands, they can do it thoroughly. These are all new tricks that the "qingke" of the past never did. Although the principle is still the old method of carrying a sign and acting as a sedan carrier.</p>
<p>Even those who carry signs and act as sedan carriers have times when their shoulders ache and their feet are sore, but these individuals seem to relish the things they do day and night, without feeling bored. They can truly be considered to have an extraordinary gift. Alas, is this why they are "qingke"?</p>

<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Yearning for a letter from home. Eyes piercing through. Reading a letter from home. Tears streaming down. Old mother longing. Wandering son unable to return. Dreamy soul returning to his hometown. Throwing himself into his kind mother's embrace. Asking mother what grieves her. Son also shedding tears often. Why has the son not returned for so long. Old mother's heart is not at ease. Son, don't go to singing and dancing places. Don't set foot in pleasure quarters. Mother's temples have already turned white. She will soon enter the yellow earth. Son already has a wife at home. Don't covet wild grass and idle flowers. The burden of a thousand jin already belongs to you. Several mouths are waiting to be fed. Now mother is already old. From now on, household affairs are the responsibility of the son's wife. Father left you more than ten years ago. Sleeping peacefully underground. Mother endured hardship and bitterness. Keeping watch as a young widow only for you. Son must remember mother's words. Take care of yourself while away from home. Strive to survive and move forward with determination. Don't let others stain your character. Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness. Keep them firmly in your heart. For the country and for the family, a man's ambition. Always be careful not to stray onto the wrong path. Compassionate mother, don't be sad. Son will obey mother's instructions. Being away from home for a long time, unable to return. Life's pressures are unavoidable. Leaving home for more than a year. Running around busily like an ox or a horse. Daughter-in-law at home longing for her husband to return. Son also taking care of himself while away from home. Who prepares the food and keeps me warm? Clothes torn and socks broken, I mend them myself. Letters from home arriving one after another. Only disturbing the son's mind. Lengthy words still not finished. Yellow dream is already awakened. Eyes feel swollen and painful. Tears pouring down on the pillow.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Miscellaneous Talk About Life and Death <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Regarding the length of a person's life, I think it is not worth getting too excited about. Dying right after being born is not necessarily sad, and living to be a hundred years old is not necessarily something to celebrate. Unless you live a pig-like life of eating and sleeping, a pure soul that comes into this world, as long as you are a person, will have a net specially designed for humanity to go through, and all troubles and pains will always follow you. Those who ride in cars have the troubles and pains of riding in cars; those who pull rickshaws have the troubles and pains of pulling rickshaws. Gathering many humans of different professions and identities, rich and poor, in one room, I think this is a good lesson to study the philosophy of life.</p>
<p>However, people always treasure life so much. As the old saying goes, "Better to live badly than to die well," and the Bund also has the warning, "Those who die young are destined to return." The funeral music played by the bereaved family is often heartbreaking, and the words of mourning written by literati all express great sorrow for death. However, I remember what the Buddhists say, that when a person is born, his process is birth, old age, sickness, and death. Ultimately, birth is the beginning of death. So what's so surprising about living a few more years or a few less years?</p>
<p>The author does not have much feeling and is saying so many unrelated things because one day I went to a relative's house to celebrate his birthday and discovered the contrast between life and death. My relative did not "live" in a way that made people amazed. According to the Chinese way of calculating age, he is exactly forty years old today. Although I have heard old people say that people nowadays are not like before, and no one lives long, I have also seen a Taoist priest who is over a hundred years old in the Great World. No matter how exaggerated he is in his advertisements, he can always be proud that he is older than someone who is forty years old. My relative lived to be forty years old, and with this small record, he made a big birthday celebration, mainly to show that after he came into this world, he did not have to worry about eating and drinking. After living comfortably for forty years and having sons and grandsons, his life's mission is almost complete, so he thought it was a great joy and he can celebrate his "living" forty years, that is the meaning.</p>
<p>At the same time, next door to my relative, a three-year-old only son died. For the Chinese, carrying on the family line is a matter of great importance. When a man marries a wife and has a son, he can be worthy of his parents and ancestors. People often say that those with many sons have good fortune. Now that a single three-year-old son has died, that's far more tragic than a record of celebrating a fortieth birthday. Crying is inevitable. After being born, after these three years, or according to the Chinese way of calculating age, probably less than two years old. While the neighbor is telling you in loud gongs and drums that one person in his family has "lived" for forty years. Maybe ten years later, he will knock on the gongs and tell you again that the forty-year-old person has become fifty years old. With such a contrast, it is worth getting excited about living a few more years or a few less years.</p>
<p>The author is a twenty-five-year-old young man who does not have any great feelings about life and death. I declare early in this article that it is not written with feeling, so I hope that the relative who is celebrating his birthday and the parents of the three-year-old only son who died will not see this article. The author is just chatting casually.</p>

<p>— Yu Gui</p>
<p>One of the City Correspondences</p>
<p>Old friend:</p>
<p>If we hadn't seen your envelope at Lou's place, we wouldn't have known about your situation after three years of separation; even though we can meet anywhere in the world, I don't believe we can't see each other again.</p>
<p>Your letter says that in the past three years, you have been living in the countryside and have completely become a country person. Old friend, what is the difference between country people and city people? Since Heaven has created each of us as a person, and each person has Heaven within them, before we have resigned from the responsibilities that Heaven has endowed us with, we all have the same five senses and four limbs. So what is the difference between country people and city people? And after we have resigned from our responsibilities, aren't we still just a smelly leather bag?</p>
<p>You say, "The so-called bankruptcy of the rural economy is probably just a four-character image in the minds of urban gentlemen. The countryside is indeed in a period of economic bankruptcy, but what's the use of shouting slogans about going to the countryside? The economic bankruptcy in the countryside is just like the recession in the city. Millionaires with millions of assets will not suffer any loss no matter how bad the recession is. The situation in the countryside is exactly the same. Large farmers with thousands of acres of land live very comfortably, and all the exploitation falls on small tenant farmers who rent a few or dozens of acres from landlords..."</p>
<p>It is true that we, who live in the city, do not have such a perceptive understanding of the countryside. Old friend, you can rely on your own strength to cultivate your own land. If we didn't have the kind of beautiful dreams we had in school, you would probably still be happy. You can live a stable life as a country person. As for us, oppressed by the city, we cannot have that kind of happiness in this life, to live a stable life as you said. Recently, Lu lost his job. Old friend, do you know that the cost of living in Shanghai is so high that we grab a thirty-yuan job, and it's like I'm snatching it from you. It's really like you said, all the exploitation falls on us, friends who live from hand to mouth!</p>
<p>Lu comes to my place every day. I still have the scraps of food left over from the exploitation of the gentleman class, so when I see Lu's unemployment, I think of how my own livelihood is as precarious as a spider web. Recently, I published an article about abandoning writing and learning martial arts, wanting to take off our long robes and become members of the blue-cloth-short-shirt class, whose lives would probably be several times better than ours. However, old friend, we are surrounded by snobbish urban eyes, and our long robes maintain our forced dignity in a state of wagging our tails and begging for mercy. Old friend, would you like to come and be a city person?</p>
<p>Your one phrase, "country person," has stirred up many complaints. I think you would not want to receive a "country person" from the city. However, since you asked about our lives in the past three years of separation, it's really like a Twenty-Four Histories. Where to start? I think I'll slowly write you another letter.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Lu and I took a photo together. We still look like people. I'll send it to you, the country person, to see, or maybe you won't recognize us anymore. The passage of three years has aged us a lot. Old friend, this is the benefit of being a city person. If you think your body is too strong, I welcome you to come and taste the flavor of being a city person.</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter in the dim light. Because I wrote too much during the day, my eyes are blurry. I still want to seize the few hours of sleep I have left. Otherwise, tomorrow's bread might change. I'll stop here. I wish you a lifetime of living a stable life as a country person.</p>

<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>In recent days, my wife has been a little unhappy again! Especially at night, lying in bed, thinking of her cold face, it really makes people feel an inexplicable sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>This is a very uninteresting thing, to be unhappy at that time; it is also the start of my writing and working. Although my body is very tired, I cannot help but cheer up and find out the reason for her unhappiness.</p>
<p>"Are you feeling unwell?" I asked cautiously, but she didn't answer, and even showed a more unhappy look.</p>
<p>This is really something only heaven knows. Being unhappy for no reason, not answering even a single question; thinking like this, I felt sad. However, getting angry is not the solution, I must be patient and ask her to make it clear.</p>
<p>"Baby, what's wrong? Tell me, tell your dear fellow!" I said, half showing my sincerity, half joking, coaxing her to tell the reason for her unhappiness.</p>
<p>But, she started crying with a "wah!"</p>
<p>This is really killing me! I was very angry, reminded of women's love of crying, I hate it!</p>
<p>"Women are really cheap things!" I was angry at this time, and felt that only by ignoring her would she live quietly.</p>
<p>"Hum! Yes! Women are cheap?" She spoke at this time!</p>

<p>"People are trying to advise you and ask you nicely, how can you not make a single sound, and not pay attention to me?"</p>
<p>"Do you know how much I am suffering!"</p>
<p>"If you don't tell people what you are suffering from, how can people know?"</p>
<p>"How can I not have told you!" wife said loudly, accompanied by sobs.</p>
<p>"Clearly, you have not said a single word."</p>
<p>"If you say I have not said anything, then I haven't said anything." I began to think through it again from the beginning, she had indeed not said anything? So I had no choice but to remain silent and ignore her.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, she stopped crying like this! No, and she even started talking to me:</p>
<p>"I haven't had my period for two months! What if I'm pregnant?!!"</p>
<p>The lives of both of us still depend on our combined intelligence and labor to barely maintain; if we add another child, it will not only disrupt our forward front, but also distract us. So it is a piece of good news in wealthy families, but in our case, we are miserable!</p>
<p>"But, this is not something to be worried about, we are born for society, and we should not let a bad society that has not been fully reformed swallow our children; we should happily give birth to them and accelerate their cultivation to become our reserves."</p>
<p>At the same time, my wife also felt that this was a kind of work that women's instincts should not avoid; she smiled through her tears! But she still pointed at my forehead with her finger and said:</p>
<p>"You are happy, I am the one who suffers, you are really a harmful person."</p>
<p>She couldn't help laughing! I wanted to take the opportunity to tease her; but my mouth was covered by one of her hands!</p>
<p>So we smiled at each other, and she took off her clothes and went to bed. I put my arms around her and gave her a long kiss.</p>

<h3 id="e238">A Word About "Nudity" and "Physical Fitness" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Shen</p>
<p>| Back from Watching "Sex Education Film" |</p>
<p>From the major newspapers and discussions with friends who have returned from studying in Germany, I know that nude sports have already become a fashionable and popular pastime in Germany. I remember not long ago, the Shanghai fashion girls and modern young masters were also making a fuss about playing this fashionable trick, and for a while, the two venerable legs of the newspaper reporters were really busy because of this trend, and a part of the society who wanted to find new stimulation also burned their desires inwardly like crazy, wishing they could immediately take off the "chiffon" and "light silk" and other things they wore and burn them or throw them into the Huangpu River. But, this was enough to disappoint the fashion girls and modern young masters, and before it was launched, it hit a strong wall | On the wall, it was written in large characters: You "violate the law," "harm public morals," "indulge in lewdness," "exploit for profit" shameless dogs!</p>
<p>I myself, except when I go to bed in the bedroom at night, or when I lock the door alone and hide in the bathroom to take a bath, and take off all my clothes (Note: Nudity too), at other times, when eating, meeting guests, or going to the office, I always wear neat clothes and act as a member of the "upper-class Chinese", so, I naturally have no objection to giving those modern people who like to find new stimulation a strong wall to bump into. Moreover, I even silently thought in my mind: The advocate and implementer of this fashionable trick is the "stimulated, thirsty" fashion girls and modern young masters in this strange society | They originally had high-class clothes and precious hats, but they were tired of wearing them, annoyed by them, and bored with them, and felt a strange boredom: To break this boredom, of course, it is necessary to wear this newest and most stimulating "nude movement" | So the fashion girls and modern young masters threw away their top hats and took off their precious pants...</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Because of this silent thought, at that time, another trend of thought was surging and surging in my heart, pounding and causing me to feel intense pain: Let's see, let's move our gaze from the group of "girls" and "young masters" to another corner of this society, look, isn't there a big girl of eighteen years old over there who still doesn't have pants to wear? Aren't those people with yellow skin and thin bones, whose bones can be seen, already "nude" all day and all year round? Why are they "nude"? Are they looking for new stimulation because they are tired of wearing clothes, annoyed by them, and bored with them? Are they violating the law, harming public morals, indulging in lewdness, and exploiting for profit? But why are they forgiven and allowed to be free from "law" without giving them a strong wall to bump into? In this way, can we use "natural disasters" and "fate" to explain them?</p>
<p>Therefore, in this contradictory and confusing society, everything has some opposing sides that make it difficult to distinguish. The so-called nude movement is the same: To say that we object, indeed, we don't need to support these guys' idle games: but if we say we support it, what reason can we use to object to the "nudity" caused by "reality"?</p>
<p>Yesterday, after watching the sex education film "The Beauty of Women" (the film describes the rational hygiene and exercise of women in a certain country) in "Shanghai", I had many feelings in my heart. The first point is that it tells us: nude outdoor exercise can improve physical fitness (the film refers to women). The second point is that this movement is not just a trick for a few idle fashion girls and modern young masters to find new stimulation. However, how much of this is completely "ideal" for people in our strange country! Because in fact, I can't forget the eighteen-year-old girl who reportedly had no pants to wear due to "natural disasters" and "fate", and the group of people with yellow skin and thin bones who were emaciated and crying naked | Why aren't they "fit" some more with their year-round, almost habitual nudity?</p>

<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I greatly admire your newspaper's amateur advice column. I have repeatedly thought about writing to consult you, but I feared my handwriting was illegible and my writing incoherent, so I felt ashamed and dared not try. Now, my situation is becoming more urgent day by day, and I have no choice but to write to earnestly request your help in resolving it quickly. I am a clerk in a pharmacy. When I was thirteen years old, my mother arranged for me to be engaged to a Miss Wang as my wife. My father passed away early, and unexpectedly, my mother also unfortunately passed away the year before last, leaving me, this miserable child. My family is very poor. Although I aspire to be self-reliant, I cannot help but feel that one hand cannot clap alone, and my burden is becoming heavier day by day. The wedding date is also approaching. My future parents-in-law also have no sons and are both in Shanghai, leaving my fiancée to live with her married older sister. My father-in-law is now unemployed, and I also subsidize his daily expenses. Because he thinks I am young, inexperienced, and without a family head, he is now taking charge and wants to ask her to come to Shanghai to marry me. I think that although coming to Shanghai would be good, it would inevitably lead to high expenses in the future, and my salary is small, making it difficult to maintain. If I were to send her back to my hometown after the marriage, there are no relatives at home to take care of her, only unrelated neighbors, and I cannot feel at ease. This situation truly puts me in a dilemma. You, sir, are a guide for young people like us. Now, please help me think of a solution. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you peace,</p>
<p>Tong Jun</p>

<p>Editor's Note: A young man deeply involved in the world needs at least someone who shares his joys and sorrows, someone older and more experienced, as his advisor. If Mr. Tong is already an adult and can barely manage his finances, then he should adopt his father-in-law's proposal, hastily complete the wedding, and then directly and straightforwardly live with his in-laws. In case of any issues, they can discuss with each other, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Your father-in-law is currently unemployed, but this is not surprising in this recessionary era; unless he is incorrigibly evil, he will eventually find a job again. At that time, the economic aspect will no longer be a problem. He has no son, and you have no father, so it would be good to cooperate with each other. Even if he has difficulty finding a job for a while, fortunately, you are able to subsidize your future in-laws' current expenses. Setting up a separate household in Shanghai is indeed very expensive, but adding a person to the existing household will not cost much; if your wife can be hardworking and frugal, the expenses will definitely not be high. Therefore, if your future father-in-law is upright and the wedding does not cost too much, then you might as well listen to your future father-in-law's proposal.</p>

<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(15) This Scared Me</p>
<p>The room was silent. My cousin wanted to leave this place and was seeking my consent. Before I could speak, the sound of high heels brought in a flamboyant woman with red and white makeup on her face, which couldn't hide her faded youth. "Are all the guests here? Why haven't you gone down yet?" Her speech was as rushed as her uncle's smoking. Only then did her eyes notice me sitting at the lower end of the opium couch.</p>
<p>"This is your nephew," she said, always so straightforward.</p>
<p>My uncle nodded. My cousin pouted. Undoubtedly, she was the second wife the doorman had mentioned. I stood up and called her Aunt.</p>
<p>My uncle smiled triumphantly.</p>
<p>The second wife smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>"Country folk are so honest. Stay for a few days. We have empty rooms here," was the price of calling her Aunt.</p>
<p>"No, I'm going back soon," I replied with a reluctant smile.</p>
<p>My uncle had finished smoking and was adjusting his melon cap in front of the dressing mirror. "Move your luggage over. There's no need to be polite at your uncle's house." He said while still holding the extinguished cigar in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Hui'er..." he turned around and said, as if he had forgotten something important. He moved his body, covered with clothes, and pulled out a letter from under the ashtray and handed it to me.</p>
<p>"Hui'er, greet Qingping." The two mismatched figures went out the door at the same time.</p>
<p>The envelope only had the six characters "For Qingping, Brother" written on it. It was my younger brother's handwriting. This was the reason for my failed lie, I thought.</p>
<p>The footsteps on the stairs gradually disappeared. My cousin said apologetically:</p>
<p>"I forgot to tell you that your brother sent a quick letter. Dad was very angry when he saw it, saying that he had arrived in Shanghai on the night train the day before yesterday and forgot to see me. I heard him and said I had arranged for some classmates to come and listen to a lecture. Dad wanted me to take his car, so I gave the driver a dollar and told him to drive around. I rushed to the Qingtai Hotel where you usually stay. The clerk recognized me, but he said you hadn't come. This scared me..." She patted her chest. "I thought you weren't coming to Shanghai!"</p>
<p>She avoided my gaze. "Would you like to take a walk in the garden?" she changed the subject as if embarrassed.</p>
<p>(16) There Will Always Be Opportunities for Young People</p>
<p>The garden was at the back of the villa and wasn't large, but it was exquisite. Coming out of the small door behind the stairs, passing over a small bridge! The flowing water under the bridge seemed to originate from the Western-style building: a winding flower path led to a temple-like structure in the center, with three large characters "藏經樓" (Scripture Repository) hanging on it. My uncle built the villa and named it Fangwai (Beyond the World), seemingly with this intention, but he hoped to have a son.</p>
<p>Anxious to know what matter was worth a city girl's shyness, I had no time to appreciate the scenery of the garden and hurriedly asked, "Hui sister, what if I didn't come to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you," she smiled. "I thought of placing an advertisement in the newspaper..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish, I interrupted:</p>
<p>"Hui sister, little brother is no longer a little brother now. If I didn't come to Shanghai, where would Shanghai go? I have friends in Shanghai, my..." I couldn't come up with a suitable Noun or Pronoun for a moment.</p>
<p>"Your what?" Perhaps girls have all learned the tone of mischievous children, like Min sister's "Aren't you dreaming now?" That same attitude flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p>I knew that perhaps a faint blush had already covered my face. I casually tore open my brother's letter. My cousin firmly grasped my wrist and said formally:</p>
<p>Brother, do you know, I almost didn't recognize you on the tram. You drink as much as you can. My letters to you have gone unanswered lately. Xin brother wrote to tell me that you, brother, have become like an old man. Brother, Dad doesn't like you much, but that's his temper. Wait, there will always be opportunities for you young people!</p>
<p>My cousin stared at me. I couldn't speak. My cousin loved me. I pitied this naturally honest country girl. Why did my mother die so early?</p>
<p>"Hui sister, I thank you. In short, I have already forgotten my past... Hui sister, I hope you remember, you are young too!"</p>
<p>She lowered her head. I was silent. The two of us walked in silence for a while. Loud laughter came from ahead. A swarm of flower butterflies, like dancing girls, flew into the garden. The one in the lead shouted loudly to my cousin: "We've been waiting for you for so long. Are you still not done talking?" She laughed, and a group of them followed suit.</p>
<p>"Brother, move your luggage over," Hui sister said softly and ran towards her friends.</p>
<p>I watched their backs disappear through the door of that Western-style building.</p>
