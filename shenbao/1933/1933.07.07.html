<p>舊事重提雙方怒形於色</p>
<p>路價懸殊之外又觸暗礁</p>
<p>日本準備卵翼傀儡攫路</p>
<p>（東京）出賣中東路會議之第四次會議、俄方代表最先提出單刀直入之宣言、謂蘇俄保有中東路之所有權、對滿方擲一大炸彈、而滿方亦否認其宣言之全部聲明「滿洲國」向俄方收買者、不過爲管理鐵路之抽象的權益、因此會議於五月二十六日開幕以來、僅僅十日、開會不過四次、而已逢着暗礁、即俄方代表申禮尼夫大使提起過去一九二二年華盛頓會議當時設立中東路共同委員會之主旨、及當時日代表松平恒雄與中國代表顔惠慶討論之經過、一九二四年北平奉俄兩恊定等主張蘇俄所有權之存在、「滿洲國」方面丁士源及大橋次長對此駁謂、蘇俄對於中東路之權利、自一九一九年及一九二０年加拉罕發表宣言、北平奉俄兩恊定成立、不過中國承認俄方管理權而已、大橋次長尤對蘇俄提起華盛頓會議當時之陳舊材料、憤慨其不誠意的態度對俄代表謂、俄方提出與現在蘇俄政府無關係之事實、則日本貸與帝制時代俄國之數萬萬盧布舊債如何辦法俄方代表聞此言均變其面色、多年留在遠東而統率俄代表團之遠東部長克資尼作夫憤然作聲曰、君爲「滿洲國」代表然提起與本議題無關係之事實、是侮辱蘇俄代表者也、會議空氣一時極爲緊張、旋大橋次長提議、兩方代表今後進行非公式交涉、以冀圓滿解决、俄代表要求暫時休會、而在别室審議、經過五十分鐘後、對滿洲代表謂、一滿洲國」代表似誤解蘇俄愛好和平之精神、且以不認蘇俄對於中東路所有權之態度、進行議事、此種討論實無益處、要求停止會議、於是第四次會議發生大波瀾、經四小時半後、暫時閉幕（六日日聯電）</p>
<h3 id="c6">蘇俄又一聲明 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>（東京）蘇俄代表昨在中東路會議關於中東路之所有權聲明如下、（一）北平恊定及奉天恊定已明載蘇俄政府、爲中東路之所有者、「滿洲國」於一九三二年三月十二向蘇俄政府提出之照會中、「滿洲國」亦曾約以關於中東路仍守兩恊定之義務、而奉天恊定第一條第七項及第十二項及北平恊定第一條第十二項及第七條等、均規定中東路財政問題改革之最後决定權屬於蘇俄、華府會議時、會議參加國雖與蘇俄無平常關係、然參加代表除承認蘇俄對中東路之所屬關係外、華府會議之議事錄、松平代表曾明白向中國代表說明、中東路爲蘇俄財產、依以上所述、中東路屬於蘇俄至爲顯明、故賣却交涉、須於合法的所有者所有之唯一當然基礎之上進行、毫無疑義蘇俄代表部確信「滿洲國」必以誠意相臨、日本政府亦必立於根據上述無議論餘地之基礎之上進行議事、（六日電通電）</p>

<p>（東京）滿洲方面於昨日中東路讓渡交涉舉行第四次會商時發表聲明如下、蘇俄方面之立論前提、雖謂中東路及其一切財產屬於蘇俄聯邦完全的單獨所有、然此等文字、關於中東路之無論何項條約均無此文、即徵諸一九一六年六月二十五日及一九二０年九月二十七日所謂兩次之加納罕宣言、又即假令此宣言以前之中東路屬於蘇俄所有、然在宣言以後、蘇俄已將所有權爲中國之利益而放棄、此項觀察乃屬至當、現即假定蘇俄單獨所有物之議論可以置信、然因中俄及奉俄恊定、蘇俄及中國以相互平等之立塲、共同管理、利益折半分配、而在今後三十年以內、須全部無償入於「滿洲國」之手、以如此之所有權爲根據、要求中東路價格全部斷難認可、蘇俄算定價格之理由、雖提出消耗蘇俄人民資源之事實、然此乃蘇俄帝政時代侵略遠東、不計虧折、而建設此路之結果、今欲此種經費之責任使「滿洲國」負担、殊難理解、蘇俄雖謂中東路財政狀態良好、共同管理以來、至一九三０年止之營業收入、超過支出一億四千萬金盧布以上、然調查中東路統計年報、七年之中平均收益僅七五０萬金盧布、是蘇俄所記載之純利、並無何等根據、要之蘇俄所要求之價格、絶對不能支付、「滿洲國」所能支付代價之限度五千萬元而已（六日電通）</p>

<p>（東京）滿方面因與俄方開四次會議交涉賣買東路問題之結果、略知俄方意圖存於何處、於是决意凖備以應其策動、即俄方雖於表面主張限定今次賣買交涉爲商業行爲、然其實以今次交涉欲擴大對於東路之權益、即俄方特爲宣言蘇俄之所有權、又宣傳其對東路之投資額爲四萬一千一百萬蘆布、「滿洲國」鑒於蘇俄如此態度、决定在現地壓迫蘇俄、其具體辦法、除斷絶中東路與烏蘇里鐵路之連絡外、改革東路管理局內制度、以掣肘蘇俄關於北平奉俄兩恊定之行爲、（六日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）俄滿賣買中東路交涉似將决裂、日軍部關於打開難關方策觀察如下、（一）兩方主張之價格相去甚遠、如俄方始終固執此價、則無方法、然在今後之涉交、採用蘇俄曾與日本交涉賣買漁區時之算定方法、以每盧布爲日金三角五分則俄方賣價二萬五千萬盧布、折合日金七八千萬元、稍可接近「滿洲國」主張之買價然則交涉前途尙有希望、㈡第四次會議討論所有權問題、此種問題不過使兩大感情惡化、今後之會議日本應勸告兩方作政治的解决、㈢然蘇俄在會議之態度欲使「滿洲國」承認俄方所有權、俄方如持續此種態度、會議前途希望極少、（六日日聯電）</p>

<h3 id="c15">中東路交涉開始實 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯不問中東路主人之意旨如何。而貿然提議出售於僞國吾人已一再痛論之。今其提議。已進而爲正式討論矣。我國爲武力所限固無法加以制裁。然而日蘇之間。是否能有相當成就。是否其外交上能轉變以前對立之形勢。而另闢一新途徑亦未可知也。以吾人揣測日蘇之關係。依然對峙。日本所以慫恿僞國爲此售路之交涉者。一則欲提高僞國之國際地位。减少日本自身之困難。即使售路交易不成。於日本亦無所損。再則二重外交。原爲日本運用方法之一。日本對此所以不負直接責任者。即以多留週轉之餘地。蘇僞此項交易。在東京開始後。蘇聯首即提議願將中東路幹線及支線計長一千零六十九英里之鐵道及其附屬車輛。與其他一切財產。出讓與滿洲傀儡。其估價約爲二億五千萬金盧布。蘇聯所以表示如是巨額之價格者。第一中東路爲歐亞貫通之主幹路線。在北滿之政治價値。尤爲强大。一旦爲僞國所有。日本操縱其間。則政治上收獲。何止今日之倍蓰。第二中東路橫貫吉黑兩省。北滿黑河流域。尙未開發東路沿線論經濟價値。正在啓蒙時代。故過去一年中雖經兵燹水災等種種阻礙。中東路贏餘。猶有一千一百餘萬盧布。僅就純經濟立塲論亦當有巨大之價値</p>
<p>然而在日人方面之觀察則反是據其傀儡所提條件觀之對蘇聯所討之價。僅還五千萬日金。并擬於三個月後即實行接收。又一再申述日本將建造東三省之鐵道網。矧吉會鐵。路將次完成。中東路經濟價値。即將减低。否則日本亦可指使傀儡以强力刦取該路。蘇聯恐亦莫如之何。日本對蘇之態度如此。直視中東路一錢不値矣。</p>
<p>是故中東路出售之交易。蘇僞雖在東京談判。但其結果如何。目前固無從懸斷。惟吾人就一般情勢觀察。日本自囊括東北三省以來。軍事上雖取得一時勝利。而滿洲之穏定性。尙不無疑問。國際外交。則以日本帝國主義之橫行。乃愈陷於孤立。英日以同盟國之舊誼。今亦不免於經濟上劇烈之鬬爭。印度。澳洲。南菲。等處之陡增關稅。即其明證。我國民對日之仇恨。已深種於一般人之心底。日人亦豈不知。故今日不得不多方設法。冀圖開闢外交上之新路徑。除向我國投下糖衣毒劑之外即以博取蘇聯之好感爲第一義。假使此次中東路交易而成功。則蘇聯匪特承認日本强奪東三省爲旣成事實。且進而與滿洲傀儡直接交涉日本在滿洲之企圖。我旣不能加以實力裁制。蘇聯又復承認其非法行爲。於是日本侵略所得。將益加穏定。所謂「滿洲國」遂在國際間取得相當地位爲外蒙古第二。此則不可謂非日本在外交上之勝利也。　　蘇聯在遠東。勢必愈陷於極度困難之境蓋其出讓中東路之主旨。在乎換</p>
<p>取和平。殊不知日本旣完成其攫取東三省之計劃。大陸政策。即由斯實現。日本軍國主義之勢力。繼漲增高。軍需工業之富源。愈益豐厚。以後進之工業技術。從事於開發滿洲。竊恐不待五年。日本即可制覇遠而制限蘇聯之發展矣。是以蘇聯對中歐諸國外交。縱能取得和平勝利。締成不侵犯公約。而揭開內幕。不過爲法蘭西抵制德意兩國法西斯主義之進展。借用蘇聯以爲之壁障耳。非眞有愛於和平也。設使一旦不幸而大戰爆發。吾人回顧以往史實。所謂條約神聖者。能不經砲火轟撀而悉成灰燼乎。</p>
<p>果如是。則出售中東路之結果。適所以助長日本帝國主義之兇鋒。增加其侵略之毒燄。蘇聯所希望之和平。终成虛幻。而我國以眞正主人之資格。又將何以自處耶。</p>

<p>八萬人而其餘之十八萬、人則全部歸劉湘統屬、故此次兩劉再戰之結果、川中軍權或竟就此統一、亦未可知、至於兩劉軍隊、截至發信止、尙未接觸、蓋以後方部署、猶各未貼恊也、劉文輝雖曾有通電發出、主張共同剿赤、但此不過開戰前例有之一種廣告、實際上彼已委出六路指揮、並任定向育仁爲後方留守司令、此皆爲戰時名目、足見作戰一事已如箭在弦上、不容不發矣羅澤洲李其相各部將領今日（三日）有致劉文輝之江電發出、中述赤禍民變堪慮、請省劉悔禍、即撤兵返防、退還鄧部防地及所佔機關、並撥兵二師偕各軍剿赤、由劉湘統率指揮、整個進行否則各軍即恊同先除障碍、以便剿匪云云、由此亦足想見羅李各部對於文輝已準備用兵矣</p>
<p>在此時際、川匪情形如何、自堪注意、據最近所得報告、徐向前匪部仍扼通南巴三縣縣境、並未出擊、正圖集中財物、裹脅民衆、田頌堯部仍扼守蒼溪國中儀隴及廣元三河南岸未反攻、綏屬泓口、另有赤匪千餘進襲黃鐘堡、此處爲劉存厚部之防線、經劉令廖震部以二團剿之、二十九日、匪已退去、是役兵匪均有傷亡、兵士傷亡者約三百人、川鄂間之賀匪、仍分佈長灘河紅土溪前站壩一帶、徐源泉正飭蔣張兩部尋匪主力、以備出擊、徐氏本人、據此間軍部所得電訊、本日（三日）已由施南返宜昌矣、</p>
<p>上川南抗捐軍聲勢仍盛、邛來縣長陳某、已被其捕殺、成都人心浮動、治安堪憂、鄧錫侯在省住宅、於本月一日晚被刦、其軍需處長寇某之子被架、未知下落、入晚八時、街道即斷行人、駐省軍隊石肇武朱執釗兩部、紀律素弛、近以餉難、尤多軌外行動、但亦無人敢於過問、鄧錫侯本人已赴金堂督師、昨（二日）開始反攻斑竹園趙家渡等處、已生激戰矣、（七月三日）</p>

<p>僑胞愛國暢銷國貨</p>
<p>暹羅中華總商會執行委員王明福君、旅居暹境、已達二十餘年、經營商業、頗得當地僑胞及暹政府當局所推重、於海外提倡國貨不遺餘力、近因鑒於國內國產出品、種類益多、尙多未至暹境、不知名目、故特由暹返國、與國內出品商及本市市商會等接洽、以便廣爲介紹、新聲社記者昨日晤王氏於旅邸、與談各點如下、</p>

<p>據王君、云我旅暹僑胞、數達二百餘萬、粤省佔大多數、閩浙兩省次之在暹以經營商業者爲最多、暹京商店、幾盡爲我華人所設、做工者有鋸木廠·舂米廠等、農業上經營田地種植者、其數亦不少故以金融地位上而論、我僑胞助其繁榮市塲、實佔一極重要之地位、暹政府對於僑胞、雖間有種種限制之舉、惟尙無不融洽之表示、該處因我國無商務員及領事等之設置、一切重要事件皆由總商會主持其事、旅暹僑胞、團結力尙佳、惜皆注重於同鄕宗族的結合、尙未完全達到整個團結之目的、</p>

<p>由自已設立者、小學約一百餘校尙屬普遍、初中程度尙祇新民一校、現在擬再進行設一高中學校、經費預定二萬餘元、惟爲數較鉅、籌備稍難、故尙在計劃之中、惟自本年四月後、暹政府命令各校、每星期須授暹維史地等二十小時以上、此事經商會等向暹政府交涉後、雖由該政府允爲减少時間、惟仍未完全解决、</p>

<p>社會局定明日調解</p>
<p>今晨復工派警彈壓</p>
<p>閘北正豐等各絲廠工人、爲要求恢復工資等、而廠方無切實答復、突於前日下午相率罷工等情、已誌本報、茲悉事後經黨警各機關召集廠工代表等勸告後、雙方情勢已趨和緩、並决定自昨晨起、照常復工、詎尙有長安路楚信等絲廠、亦於昨晨繼起罷工、因此範圍擴大、又因工人情形複雜、竟有乘機滋擾情事、幸各區警所維持有方、始免意外社會局定明日（八日）召集廠工兩方調解、茲將昨日間情形分紀如下、</p>
<p>會議復工正豐·怡昌·義豐盛·雲成·長豐·正大·祥成·永亭·等絲廠工人、自前日（五日）相率罷工後、當日仍相聚不散、直至午後五時五十分許、經</p>

<p>下午又停　散會後工會職員即四出向各廠工人勸告復工、因此昨晨（六日）各廠照常放汽開工、上午情形怡昌及兩分廠全體到廠、惟到廠時間不一、義豐盛、僅到工人十份之一、正豐、十份之七、雲成、十份之一、長豐、十份之六、正大、齊到、祥成、十份之一、永亭、十份之八、福綸恒未參加罷工故未發生問題、及至下午、工人方面得悉閘北其他二十七家絲廠繼起罷工、對於已復工各廠、將有不利消息、因此均觀望不前、故除怡昌外、自下午起、又入停工狀態、同時在下午五時五十分許、黨怡昌及兩分廠將放工時、突有無頼數十人手、持穢物、在該處附近逗留不去、意將向該廠工人示威、幸經附近岡警覺察、亟向警所報告、當派大批長警馳往彈壓、得以未釀他、變而工人等因此畏懼、故定今日（七日）全部復工問題、尙難預斷、內中雲成·正豐·兩廠、因機爐損壞、宣告於今日（七日）停工一天以資修理、並已呈報黨政機關備案、祥成·義豐盛·兩廠工人、據稱屆時如其他各廠正式復工該廠工人、當可不成問題云、</p>
<p>波及全區閘北一區開工者、計單宫三十一家、自正豐等各廠罷工後、滬太路復昌絲廠、男女工人八百名、於昨晨六時、突然相率罷工嗣經第六區繅絲工會派員前往勸導、即於十時許一律復工下午一時大洋橋豐泰順、潭子灣裕泰女工、亦相率罷工秩序混亂、結羣向各絲廠要求將一致行動、於是閘北區長安路懋豐·乾源·恊新·宏生·楚信·積餘恊記·振興·寳泰順·元新·共和路積餘泰記·大洋橋豐泰順·潭子灣裕泰·滬太路復昌·中興路公大·譚家橋懋利·大勝橋天勝·顧家灣興倫·光復路嘉泰·宏春·南梅園路五興·恒豐路美豐·元豐·福源·愼泰·裕通路源興·源記·顧家灣豫豐·等二十七家工人遂亦繼起罷工</p>
<p>發生紛擾當乾源等廠工人罷工時、第六區繅絲工會理事楊賡禔·袁雲龍·吳素貞等、即率領全體幹事、分頭出發、勸告工人、公安局四區總署長警、亦一律出發維持秩、序并勸告工人、長安路楚信絲廠女工不服勸告致於警士衝突、四區巡長一名、被投石擊傷、當拘捕肇事女工二名、經區長訓斥後、姑念無知旋即釋放、</p>

<p>各廠工女工工資原爲六角、月賞四天、星期賞三角、男工工資、按月計算月賞四天、蠶蛾每人</p>
<p>每月每元四角五分復因絲價低落、故工資乃减爲七折、曾發生罷工、後始改爲七五折計算、及至今年絲價上漲、而資方答復、男工工資按月計算、月薪須依照工作成績增加蠶蛾津貼、每人每月每元二角工人工作一月者、賞工二天、女工工資按日計算、工資每人每月四角八分、工作一星期賞工二角工作一月賞工二天此次各廠工人突然罷工據第四區繅絲業產業工會云係永亨與正豐兩廠意見不合而起首由永亭工人於中午放工時至正豐廠前挑撥、謂永亨早已罷工、以致正豐少數工人、首先發動繼即牽動全部、後正豐工人見永亨工人仍在工作、乃責其造謠煽動、以致亦告罷工波及於各廠、故此次事件、實係資方嫉妒引起勞資問題云、</p>

<h3 id="c189">魚雁吃官司 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>應請王實甫做辯護律師</p>
<p>上海灘上無奇不有的種種事件之中，竟有　差串同兩少年私拆少女往來函件的奇聞。</p>
<p>一六六號信差葉臥雲太多事了；人家寄給少女的書信，怎麽不送給少女，卻送給不相干的惡少年，在弄堂口皮匠攤旁邊偷看呢？現在事已證實，拘送刑庭，依刑法三三三條妨害秘密罪起訴，這是葉臥雲自取之禍，誰都以爲要嚴懲的。</p>
<p>明信片上的情書，當然可以給綠衣使者先睹爲快；寄信人多出了幾分郵資，一經漿糊封口，便取得了秘密自由權。信差有送信的義務，没有拆信的權利，葉臥雲所犯的刑章，是很難替他辯護的，若要辯護，除非請出西廂記中的紅娘來。</p>
<p>閙簡篇中，紅娘唱云；「幾曾見寄書的顚倒瞞着魚雁」？紅娘旣這麽說，可見紅娘意中的寄書人，不該把書中內容瞞卻魚雁；而做了魚雁，儘有知道寄書人書中秘密的權利。葉臥雲充當信差，便是充當魚雁，他若請得到傳書遞簡的紅娘姐做辯護人，提出「幾曾見寄書的顚倒瞞着魚雁」？做辯護的大理由；我想葉臥雲一定可以宣告無罪的。况且，紅娘姐法律精深，「美香娘處分花木瓜」，都是紅娘姐在「喬坐衙」時替小姐宣判；有了這般的辯才，替葉臥雲平反寃獄，當然没有魚雁吃官司的一回事了。</p>
<p>但是，西廂記的作者，共知爲王實甫先生，與其請紅娘姐做辯護人，不如請王實甫先生做辯護人；只爲紅娘口中的話，便是王實甫筆下的文章；金聖歎批評西廂記，最佩服這一句「幾曾見寄書的顚倒瞞着魚雁」？評云：「奇奇妙妙，自從盤古直至今朝，眞並無此事也，亦並無此文也」。王實甫的文字魔力，可以使聖嘆這般的顚倒，良非易行。</p>
<p>吃官司的葉臥雲不用恐怖，快到過去六百年的世界中請到這位元代詞人王實甫先生做你的義務律師，你便可以脫然無事了。</p>
<h3 id="c190">催眠曲 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 葉奕頣</p>
<p>「不要吵，不要閙，寳寳要睡了」</p>
<p>這是在上海很流行的一首催眠曲中之一段。差不多每一個人都聽見過；每一個靑年學生和每一個女子會得唱！</p>
<p>你如果跑到那光怪陸離的十字街頭，那末，你就可以在那大商店的門前，聽到那無線電收音機上所廣播的各種彈詞與歌唱。許多的人，會不期然的聚集在一起，仰起了頭來傾聽着。但奇怪的是，你仰起了頭來傾聽，而有時候，在那隻小木箱內，會奏出鼻音的催眠曲來；無論是在早上或午後，他總會「不要吵，不要閙，寳寳要睡了」地催你睡眠起來！實際上，你可不能睡的吧？</p>
<p>有的商家，仍舊是聘請了軍樂隊在那裏大吹大鼓；然而他們却也時髦得很，吹打起催眠曲來；你如果是在那遠遠裏跑去，你就可以聽到底底底和銅銅銅的聲音！</p>
<p>啊！咱們的同胞原都是喜歡時髦的呵！可是一般的，都會盲目地去翻花樣；而不知道這件事的適切與否？</p>
<p>日本兵在咱們的國土上侵進了一段，於是，通電呐喊，開會呼號，似乎是很救國的了；但這種不關痛癢的事，究有何用呢？也許就是因爲了這個道理，所以便有聰明者的催眠曲之起，意避亂世，但，希望這催眠曲不要催醒人。</p>
<p>永永地使同胞睡吧，睡他一個千日千年；好在待到將來醒時，日本人會端面</p>
<p>水給你洗面，預備早飯把你吃。</p>

<p>當你向伊進攻之初，伊確是一個異常尊貴而神秘的女人；但，在你的希望實現以後，伊一切的尊貴，神秘，也就自然地消失了！</p>
<p>假使你受了驕傲女人的氣，須忍耐着努力向伊追求，一旦勝利了，在伊愛你之日正是你復仇之時！</p>
<p>鐘，是最刁滑的東西，當你和情人約會以前它一定踟蹰不前，故意與你爲難；但等你和情人見面以後，它却又飛步狂奔，啊！鐘呵！你眞會玩弄人！</p>
<p>當你挽着愛人的纖腰，徐步街頭時，一切的景物，都是爲你而設；但在你失戀以後，那美麗的景物，頓時會變成　凉的廢墟！</p>

<p>「拉快！猪　」！都市少爺的駡聲。</p>
<p>黃豆大的汗珠直淋，踏着火熱的馬路的脚底，湯起了泡，但爲了二毛錢的代價，爲了要養活妻了·兒女，不得不拚着命拉！</p>
<p>冰的幌子，在太陽光裏哭喪着臉，大玻璃窗裏擺着冰淇淋，汽水，刨冰，│玫瑰，香焦，檸檬……</p>
<p>紅的嘴唇，含着白的麥管，幽綠的燈光，映着素衣的侍者，電風扇轉着，機器冰流着，立在街頭，走進飲冰室至少要差三十度氣候。</p>

<p>來吧，喝杯冰淇淋，在大熱天裏，</p>
<p>汗水淋漓的當兒，誰都愛聽這一句話兒。</p>
<p>可是冰淇淋也有幾等，貴族化的冷飲店裏，喝一杯怕不化上好幾毛錢，外加踢破，那不是窮人一日糧嗎│沿街呌喊的十文一杯，恐怕有些靠不住，喝了下去，準會坐了白色汽車，送你到時疫醫院裏去。再厲害一些，也許會使你額角冰起，冰到脚跟爲止，貪嘴不留窮性命，眞是合不上算！</p>
<p>算了吧！你這樣的宣傳，冷飲店老　怕不和你拚命；愛冷飲的人，未必把這些言語，當作金科玉律。現在我也有一杯冰淇淋，奉獻給諸君。</p>
<p>紀曉嵐先生所著的閱微草堂筆記中，</p>
<p>有着一段話道：「某士人館室湫隘，幾不可舉頭，門無簾，床無帳，院落無樹，久旱炎鬱，如坐炊甑。解衣午憇，蠅擾擾不得交睫，煩噪殆不可耐，自謂此猛火地獄也。久之倦極睡去，夢乘舟大海中，颶風陡作，天日晦冥，檣斷帆摧，心膽俱裂。頃刻覆没，似有人提出，</p>
<p>擲於岸上。即有人持繩束縛，閉置地窖中，闇不睹物，呼吸亦咽塞不通，恐怖窘急，不可言狀，俄聞耳畔呼聲，霍然開目，則仍臥三脚木榻上。覺四體舒適，心神開朗，如居蓬萊方丈間也。」</p>
<p>上海的居民，在都住在鴿棚式的房屋中，煩噪殆和那士人不相上下。當你熱得不能忍耐時，請一讀上文，我知必有許多人士合十朗誦曰：</p>

<p>到晚上裝成之後，那喬其紗裏住了三節式的身體，胸部向前高聳的，是雙雙的乳峯，腰間細細地像根蘆管，後腰下面向後凸出的是高高的臀部·長又旗袍裏，隠約著兩根粗粗大小腿·有些還不穿襪子，│假如你的腿上有疤，還是套一雙襪子的好，│這樣一條富有肉感的身體，很能吸引着異性向伊去追逐·再看到伊的面部，祇能看見白白的一張臉，中間一張鮮紅的嘴，這倒有一比，好似香草冰淇淋上面放着一顆紅櫻桃一般再也不必去鑒賞伊面貎的妍媸了，因爲你仔細看時，會使你大呌起來·</p>
<p>在以前，上面所說的，是屬於低級的女人，可是時代進展了，一般中級的女人，也都有這樣的趨向·不信，你祗消每天站在十字街頭，總能領略到無數肉感豐富女人的表現·這是並不要化錢而能多多的飽覽；那麽還有一般化了錢去看羅宋女人的×種跳舞的人，眞是天下第一個大傻子了！</p>

<p>這也許是夏的表現吧！在每個公園裏，每天的早晨，就有成對的靑年人兒，密談的也有，戲謔的也有，調笑的也有，挽行的也有……，凡是在戀愛史上應有的節目，差不多都可以看到·</p>
<p>不過另一世界的人物，在每個公園裏也都能看到·就是打太極拳的也有，看書的也有，閒坐的也有，跑步的也有，閒走的也有，更有中國女傭推着外國小孩車的也有，中國女人和小孩一般的也有……，這樣，美妙的公園，却不能讓有情人獨占了，</p>

<h3 id="c219">序的解放 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 桃椎</p>
<p>一個人做了一部書，「藏之名山，傳之其人」，那是封建時代的事，早已過去了。現在是二十世紀過了三十三年，地方是上海的租界上，做買辦立刻享榮華，當文學家怎不馬上要名利，於是乎有術存焉。</p>
<p>那術，是自已先决定自已是文學家，並且有點遺產或津貼。接着就自開書店，自辦雜誌，自登文章，自做廣告，自報消息，自想花樣……然而不成，詩的解放，先已有人，詞的解放，只好騙鳥，於是乎「序的解放」起矣。</p>
<p>夫序，原是古已有之，有别人做的，有自忆做的。但這未免太迂，不合於「新時代」的「文學家」的胃口。因爲自序難於吹牛，而别人來做，也不見得定規拍馬，那自然只好解放解放，就是自已替别人來給自已的東西作序，術語曰「摘錄來信」，眞說得好像錦上添花。「好評一束」還須附在尾巴頭，代序却一開卷就看見一大番頌揚，彷彿名角一登塲，滿塲就大喝一聲采，何等有趣。倘是戲子，就得先買許多留聲機，自已將「好」呌進去，待到上臺的時候，一面一齊開起來。</p>
<p>可是這樣的玩意兒給人戳穿了怎麽辦呢？也有術的。立刻裝出「可憐」相，說自己旣無黨派，也不借主義，又没有帮口「向來不敢狂妄」毫没有「座談」時候的搖頭擺尾的得意忘形的氣味兒了，倒好像别人乃是反動派，殺人放火主義，靑帮紅帮，來欺侮了這位文弱而有天才的公子哥兒似的。</p>
<p>更有效的是說，他的被攻擊，實乃因爲「能力薄弱，無法滿足朋友們之要求」。我們倘不知道這位「文學家」的性别，就會疑心到有許多有黨派或帮口的人們，向他屢次的借錢，或向她使勁的求婚或什麽，「無法滿足」，遂受了寃枉的報復的。</p>
<p>但我希望我的話仍然無損於「新時代」的「文學家」，也「摘」出一條「好評」來作爲「代跋」罷：</p>
<p>『「藏之名山，傳之其人」早已過去了，二十世紀，有術存焉，詞的解放，解放解放，錦上添花，何等有趣？可是别人乃是反動派，來欺侮這位文弱而有天才的公子，實乃因爲「能力薄弱，無法滿足朋友們的要求」，遂受了寃枉的報復的，無損於「新時代」的「文學家」也。』</p>
<h3 id="c220">刑賞忠厚之至 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>「吾友」木齋先生融會新舊，博通古今，可以端拜而議。其議「考」，謂當師古法，明「刑賞」，雖賈誼董仲舒復生，也不過如此說。</p>
<p>前人筆記說唐太宗私行按訪，看見許</p>
<p>多新科秀才（註）的得意忘形，心裏大爲高興，道：「天下英雄盡入吾彀中！」中國考試的古法古意，本來是要「天下英雄盡入吾彀中。」把靑年一點豪情壯志，消磨於螢窗之下，野性的狼，漸漸馴化而爲搖尾巴的狗：自古至今，考試没有不注重文章，也没有不用孔家經典；元清雖以夷狄入中國，而八股試帖之勢力不衰，其勢然也！</p>
<p>北宋大文家蘇東坡，他的省試名作刑賞忠厚之至論，說：「先王知天下之善不勝賞，而爵祿不足以勸也，知天下之惡不勝刑而刀鋸不足以裁也，是故舉而歸之於仁，以君子長者之道待天下，使天下相率而歸於君子長者之道，故曰忠厚之至也。」其意若曰：有功的受上賞，那是當然的；功狗太多了，賞不勝賞，將奈何？反動派的該處重刑，也是當然的；反動派太多了，罰不勝罰，將奈何？先王想出一個妙法，呌大家歸之於君子長者之道，歸之於忠厚之至的「仁」。「仁」是一個抽象的名詞，見之於行事，定一種制度曰「科舉」。其意若曰：你們要高官厚祿，那就該來應考；你們要來應考，那就該依照我的功令程式；你們依了我的功令程式，那就一生得在聖經賢傳中翻觔斗；這豈不是非以高官厚祿賞，而其效大於以高官厚祿賞？你們若不應考，或應考而不遵功令程式，如朱買臣窮居，蘇秦下第，父不以爲子，妻不以爲夫，嫂不以爲叔，只好懸樑刺股，再發憤一下；這不是非以刀鋸懲，而其效神於以刀鋸懲？諺云；「敎婦初來，敎兒嬰孩。」在靑年時代，先磨鍊磨鍊，磨鍊一副上好坯子，好則足以受上賞，壞亦免於流入反動，豈非忠厚之于嗎？</p>
<p>救治時疫，須用古方：肚痛請吃香灰，三陰瘧要唸高皇經，吾輩聖人之徒，惟讀經方能救國再申蘇子之說以候行人之采風！</p>
<p>（註）唐代秀才地位尊貴，略與明清進士相彷彿。</p>
<h3 id="c221">夜 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 繆崇羣</p>
<p>隔了一個夏天我又回到南京來，現在我是度着南京的第二個夏天。</p>
<p>當初在外邊，逢到夏天但懷想起父親的病，在這樣的季候，常常喚起了我的憂鬱和不安。</p>
<p>如今還是在外邊，懷想却成了一塊空白。夏天到來了，父親的臉，父親的肉，父親的白白的鬍鬚，怕在棺木裏也會漸朽漸盡了罷？是在這樣的季候了。</p>
<p>和弟弟分别的時候說；</p>
<p>「和父親同年的一般人差不多都死光了，現在剩下的只有我們這一輩。」</p>
<p>一年一年地度了過去，我不曉得我的心是更寂寞了下去還是更寗靜下去了。</p>
<p>往昔我好像一匹驛馬，從東到西；南一趟北一趟，長久地喘息着奔馳。如今不知怎麽，拖到那個站驛便是那個站驛，而且我是這樣需要休息，到了罷，到了那個站驛我便想駐留下來；就在這一個站驛裏，永遠使我休息。</p>
<p>這次回到南京來，我是再也不想動彈了。因爲没有安適駐留的地方，索性就蹲在像槽一般大的妻的家裏。我原想在這里閉兩天的氣，那知道一個别了很久的老友又來臨了。</p>
<p>這個槽，只有這麽大，他也只得占一張小小的行軍床爲他的領地。</p>
<p>在夏夜，我常常是失眠的，每夜油澄捻小了過後，他們便都安然地就睡；燈不久也像疲憊了似的自已熄滅了。</p>
<p>我煩燥，我傾耳，我怎麽也聽不見一點聲音，夜是這樣的黑暗而沉寂，我委實不知道我竟歇在那里。</p>
<p>莫名的煩燥，引起了我身上莫名的痒　莫名的痒　，又引起了我心上莫名的煩燥。</p>
<p>我决心地劃了一支火柴，是要把這夜的黑暗與沉寂一同撕開。</p>
<p>在刹那的光亮裏，我看見那古舊了的板壁下面睡着我的老友，我的身邊睡着我的妻。白的褥單上面，一顆一顆梨子子大的「南京蟲」却在怱忙地奔馳。</p>
<p>火柴熄了，夜還是回到他的黑暗與沉寂。</p>
<p>吸血的東西在暗處。</p>
<p>朋友不時地短短地夢　着。</p>
<p>妻也不時地短短地夢　着。</p>
<p>我問他們，他們都没有答語我恐怖地想：睡在這一個屋裏的没有朋友也没有妻，他們只是兩具人形，而且還像是被幽靈伏罩住的。</p>
<p>夜就是幽靈的。</p>
<p>我還是聽不見什麽聲音，倘使蚊香的香灰落在盤裏有聲，那是被我聽見了。</p>
<p>我還是看不見什麽東西，如果那一點點蚊香的紅火頭就是我看見的，那無寗說是他還在看着我們三個罷。</p>
<p>不知怎麽，蚊香的火頭，我看見兩個了；幽靈像是携了我的手，我不知怎麽就到了第二天的早晨。</p>
<p>第二天的早晨我等他們都醒了便問：「昨天夜裏你們做了什麽夢？」</p>
<p>「没有。」笑嘻嘻的，都不記得了。</p>
<p>「昨夜我不知怎麽看見蚊香盤裏兩個紅火頭。」我帶着昨夜的神秘來問。</p>
<p>「那是你的錯覺。」朋友連我看見的也不承認了。</p>
<p>···············</p>
<p>「多少年了，像老朋友這樣的朋友却没有增加起來過。」</p>
<p>朋友不知怎麽忽地想起了這樣一句話說。</p>
<p>我沉默着·想起這次和弟弟分别時候的話來，又想補足了說··</p>
<p>：「我們這一輩的也已經看着看着凋零了。」</p>

<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>「那末，做甚麽呢？」雍孫問。</p>
<p>「他們說是要用長眞營造廠的名義接濟閘北。」</p>
<p>大衆聽到這裏像是都發呆了。雍孫從榻上坐起來，雙手撑在榻邊，用疑惑的神情向伯唐問：</p>
<p>廠裏曾經接濟過一些甚麽没有？</p>
<p>「第一次，」伯唐說用慰勞的名義捐過兩百塊……第二次，又向紅十字會捐過四百塊錢的藥品和三十副間架床。上禮拜三，又借一部運材料的卡車給地方維護會拿去用。」</p>
<p>「那末……」雍孫拉長了聲音說「那末……也算是盡了些義務啊……事體末……現在末……我應當怎樣說……才好？……」</p>
<p>大衆都望雍孫，他呢，舉起一隻手掻了一會腦袋，末了才說：</p>
<p>「伯唐，他們旣然是明天早上來，我們明天早上再談罷！」這時候，丫頭又進來了：</p>
<p>「張先生有電話來，大少爺，呌我問大少爺明天早上在不在公館裏」？</p>
<p>「那一個張先生？」伯唐問。</p>
<p>「廠裏管事的張子虞先生。他說今天晚上没有照會不能出來。」</p>
<p>伯康没有回答，就立起來走出房門到電話跟前去說話。</p>
<p>回到屋子裏的時候，他瞧見雍孫已經披好了大衣。</p>
<p>「爹可是要走了？」</p>
<p>「是的，我要走了。」雍孫說完接着就問：「之光可曉得廠裡的信息？」</p>
<p>「他曉得一點兒，不過並不很清楚，他也是剛剛才得到信息的……現在，他明天一天早先到廠去一躺再來……」</p>
<p>「這倒也好。」</p>
<p>「爹今天可要回來到這裡住？」</p>
<p>「恐怕不來了，你這裡住的人也不少，我不來，就可以少占一隻床，大家也就略略舒展一點！」</p>
<p>雍孫說完，就瞧着那些在伯唐家裡避難的人若有若無地微笑。伯唐問：</p>
<p>「明天要和爹會面，應當到那裡來？」</p>
<p>雍孫思索了一會才說：</p>
<p>「你們聽我的電話罷，現在眞說不定……廠裏的事，你自己斟酌罷。」</p>
<p>於是他就慢慢地出了這屋子的門了，屋子裏的人影子，也一個個跟着出來。</p>
<p>㈡</p>
<p>八九個鐘頭以後，朝暾的灰色無力的光，已經慢地剌破了那層罩在十里洋塲上的薄霧，這時候，近處的砲聲，好像守着十來天以來的慣例似地，一到天明，早就停了；雖然遠處的砲聲還從東北風裡一陣一陣隠約地送過來，可是洋塲上的人，似乎這時候誰也忘記了自己就橫在閘北一帶的現實的修羅塲後面：那些睡熟没有醒的，固然是依舊延長昨夜的黑甜滋味，那些用體力或者用動力在地面上活動的，固然是爲日行生活而忙，可是那些張開眼與在床上的或者坐立椅子上的，至多也不過是拿了早上出版的日報搖頭微嘆！</p>
<p>然而這時候的姚伯唐究竟何所事事呢？</p>

<h3 id="c224">今日的文人 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 奔</p>
<p>過去，在中國，文人是很尙氣節的，從「士可殺而不可辱」看來，便可知一般文人，大抵要矜持三分臉皮，比如李太白那麽一個落拓的文人，他上韓荊州書，態度却很嚴正，不亢不卑，字裏行間，都流露着一幅文人的硬骨，一般文人因受古昔聖賢的「學而優則仕」的薰染太深，以及文人必需仕進的的封建環境的引誘，固然是誰都想做官，誰都視做官是文人應有的出路，但若求拜不得，或得之而不愜意，也就爽爽直直退隠田園，陶潛就是一個好例。</p>
<p>進而說到文人與文人之間，雖不無派别之分，黨系之爭，但氣節還很講究，彼此砥礪學行很少瞎相標榜，瞎相攻訐的，更鮮在某一個短時期裏相契得像火漆一團，轉忽便如村婦之信口漫駡，醜態百出。</p>
<p>這，我想凡讀過文學史，以及略略涉獵過古來文存的人所共有的通感，信非作者向壁虛搆。</p>
<p>歷史演進，時代遞嬻，一到今日的資本主義社會，文人的骨與血，都彷彿掉換了來源似的，氣節掃蕩無遺，於是惹得一般「疾世憤俗」的道學長者托長嗓子嘆曰：「世風日下，人心不古，」其實社會是進化不停的，「古」是大可不必，只有「世風日下，」氣節淹滅殆盡那確不是文人進化應有的現象，引得小孩子如作者也要來呌一聲「良堪浩嘆。」</p>
<p>今日的文人，其想做官的强度，恐比古人要超勝千倍萬倍，因爲現在的官大有「僧多粥少」之概，一介文人，全靠了滿腦袋的智識，若想插進去，那是根本不興，而又因「歌功頌德」的求官法，早已不通行於今日，於是便妙想天開，進一步以玩拍賣靈魂的勾當，於是便有昔爲普羅作家的文人，搖身一變，儘可</p>
<p>赫赫然而當縣長，昔爲××黨員的儘有在旦夕之暫，被收買而做督察官吏，這一類的人，原是滔滔者天下皆是。</p>
<p>文人而至此，氣節本已蕩然無存矣。</p>
<p>而文人與文人之間，更多朝秦暮楚，今日與你相契，便瞎相標榜，明日儘可視若仇敵，攻訐不遺餘力的，結社合作見於前日，拆台相打聞於今朝，轉向無常，醜態百出。</p>
<p>今日的文人的把戲無非是這樣呵！</p>
<p>事實告訴我們，智識階級已到了没落的時期，臨近了墳墓的境界，絲毫不講氣節，一味死不要臉，許是夕陽反照，臨終掙扎的最末一幕醜態吧！</p>
<h3 id="c225">初夏的奇蹟 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>本是這樣姗姗其來遲·都巿的氣氛中我没有見一枝紅的桃綠的柳·也没有黃鶑在我窗前弄舌；而初夏的薰風已降臨到小樓。</p>
<p>早上起身遍體感到莫名的不舒適，没有早餐，獨自上霞飛路散步。霞飛路和我像故友一般親切，當我從書本上</p>
<p>踏進社會時，整整三年，我的生命交付了霞飛路，如今爲了環境關係，從那羅曼蒂克的懷抱中遷入湫隘的小樓，重上霞飛路，精神爲之一振，似曾相識的店舖，已換上新的招貼；僅僅一年光景，祗有路旁的小樹，還在晨風中飄拂，然而也長成得多了。</p>
<p>時候還早，晴朗的天，清道夫拖着垃圾車低頭慢步，如置身　境一樣，我數着人行道的方塊飄飄然。脚步是那樣的緩遲，口中吹着夢裏情人的流行歌曲　，忘其所以的走。遠遠的一個靑春的少婦，潔白的綢衣，推着小孩的睡車向我近來，她是安閑，輕快側着頭似乎逗引她的小寳貝，微笑從她嘴角邊溜過，髮鬢在晨風中飛動。</p>
<p>美麗的窗飾前我們迎面碰見，熟識的輪廓，我逃避了她的視線，從她身側擦肩而過，但是不願意走遠，偷偷地溜轉眼來，她正兩手反靠在車背上注視我的背影。</p>
<p>「玲姑娘」在我喉頭打了一個滾。</p>
<p>「張先生是你！」她拖着睡車跳過來。</p>
<p>「雖面熟的，却不認識了。」</p>
<p>微笑從她嘴角邊溜過，髮鬢在晨風中飛動。</p>
<p>「還在那俄國婦人家裏？」</p>
<p>「不，隨意走走。」</p>
<p>「到法國公園去？」</p>
<p>我推着睡車，孩子對我笑。</p>
<p>「是你的？」</p>
<p>她點點頭，處女的羞暈上她的兩頰。</p>
<p>我住在俄國婦人家裏的時候，認識了玲姑娘，她還是個十五歲的頑皮孩了，吃巧克力，玩皮球。因爲自已是孤獨的人，得了個天眞的伴侣怪歡喜。一天，在法國公園中無意間問她：「要讀書嗎？」她說没有錢，我得應敎她，自下一天起，她每晚到我居處讀書。</p>
<p>夏天，我們早上在法國公園相見，敎書也改在那時，在門口的茅亭上。晚上我兼職了夜館的緣故。</p>
<p>玲姑娘很聰明，她已能辨明Ｉ與Ｍe的用法。也是晴朗的一天，没有敎課之前，她問我「愛」怎樣讀音。「Ｌove」我說。</p>

<p>人生在世，究竟爲的什麽？</p>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>茲有一問題，即「人生在世，究竟爲的什麽；」前閱梁任公遺著，有此一篇論文；但終未答出究竟，懷疑至今。鄙人才疏學淺，未敢妄加論列。茲承友好葉韋兩君·不棄愚陋，代爲解答，說「人生在世，歸根究底，爲的是吃飯」。兩君並引中山先生三民主義注重民生，而民生主義，闢有吃飯問題專　　極力辯　以議某　　不　。兩君　引現世經濟恐慌，社會危機，失業問題，無不直接間接與吃飯問題有關，以爲佐證。十餘年來未獲解决之難題，一旦爲兩君道破，快何如耶？然靜夜思之，似其言有未竟者，特奉函就敎於先生，請賜最後之指導，則不勝感激之至矣。肅此敬頌</p>
<h3 id="c228">撰安　劉杏川謹上 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>編者按：人生在世，爲的就是一個「生」字，螻蟻尙且貪生，而况於人乎。在這「生」字的涵義裏，就有兩個要素：㈠怎樣能夠生，㈡怎樣生得有意義。在第一個問題還没有辦法的人，就無暇，而且也不必顧到第二個問題。不過一旦你第一個問題有了解决，就不能不有做到第二步的企圖了。因爲不如此，你就會失却生命的原動力。第一個問題不得解决，不免要被逼自殺；第二個問題，不得解决，就會厭世；形態雖殊，而其不能生存則一也。在物質競爭和緩的以前，當然有人說「人生在世，爲的要建功立業」；在這生存競爭尖銳化的現在，當然可以說「人生在世，爲的是要吃飯」。但是社會是不平等的，在大衆吃飯不成問題的時候，難保不有無以爲生的少數；同樣在大衆生活無法維持的現在，也有極少數的資產階級。所以我們還以爲人生在世，爲的是一個「生」字；「怎樣能夠生」與「怎樣生的有意義」，兩者不可偏廢。</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>「你不去嗎？」三婕太喊着。</p>
<p>「但是，我還没有吃飯呢？」他想用這理由推辭。</p>
<p>「我也正想吃些點心呢，我就陪你到這附近一家西菜館去吧！」三婕太這樣緊逼着，婦女的驕心使她一定要把他從美子身邊奪過來。</p>
<p>隨即她故意親暱地牽住石喬的手臂。於是好像一般靑年情侣地並肩的向花園那邊緩慢的走去。</p>
<p>「這個二房東女人是東洋婆子啊，你不是最恨東洋人嗎？」三姨太低聲說：「嘿，可以想見你說什麽愛國也是假的。」</p>
<p>對於這種淺薄幼稚的話，他當然没有辯答的必要，而更重大的問題，到西菜館吃東西他可没有一個錢的。三姨太當然不會想到這一層，繼續說道：「東洋人終歸是不好惹的啊！而且，俄國人成天守在屋裏的呢！」</p>
<p>「喂！你怎的一聲不嚮呢？你生氣了嗎？」││「我有什麽對你不好麽？你說，你說！」</p>
<p>請他吃飯，陪他跳舞，更讓他……好當然是對他好的，這聽他怎麽回答呢。</p>
<p>好在拍面，王化正陪着另一個什麽人朝自已走來，很遠地便喊道；</p>
<p>「石喬，石喬！到那兒去，到那兒去？」</p>
<p>當走攏來的時候，那同來的人是胡元良，一條長瘦子，和石喬是很久不見的朋友了。王化换了一套很整齊的西裝，連頭髮也梳得光光的，雖不夠稱小白臉，却是一個典型的小滑頭樣子。鬼鬼祟祟的向石喬低聲說；</p>
<p>「請介紹！」</p>
<p>「哦，是的，這位是米司特王化，這位是米司特胡元良。」石喬而後再指着三姨太：「這位是米司，米司李！」</p>
<p>「哦，原來你們是本家！好極，好極。」這話當然是王化說的。然後他再挨到石喬的耳邊：</p>
<p>「你好，你好！」│「看，我們要開始正式活動起來了，你看，我今天特借了一套西裝穿，活動的時候總要穿得漂亮，最忌窮相！元良對於我們的事完全同意，元良！</p>
<p>那長瘦子不免走上來和石喬寒　幾句。</p>
<p>「今晚我們再到你家裏來！再見。米司李！」</p>
<p>王矮子領導胡瘦子很恭敬的鞠了一躬。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Telegraph from Yin Lei and Xue on the Outcome of the Final Meeting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Starting from the 10th, regardless of Luan East or North of Ping, counties will be taken over sequentially by our county magistrates. The Luan River Bridge can be repaired in five days. The Japanese army has decided to completely withdraw, and the railway negotiations will aim to restore the situation before the Yu Incident.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Kwantung Army is the Negotiating Party, Only Records and Does Not Sign <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Xue Zhiheng and others are scheduled to return to Ping by ship on the 7th.</p>
<p>(Beiping) The political situation is calming down. The Sino-Japanese negotiations in Dalian in recent days have proceeded smoothly. Our committee members Yin, Lei, and Xue telegraphed Ping on the 6th that all opinions have been thoroughly exchanged and that they are scheduled to return to Ping by ship on the 7th. The results of the final meeting are as follows: (1) Starting from the 10th, regardless of Luan East or North of Ping, the respective county magistrates will lead the police to take over the counties sequentially; (2) The Luan River Bridge can be repaired in five days, and the Japanese army has decided to completely withdraw; (3) All railway negotiations will be conducted according to the telegram's instructions, aiming to restore the situation before the Yu Incident; (4) The Kwantung Army will be the negotiating party in all matters. There is no formal meeting, so the main points of the talks will only be recorded and not signed. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Dalian meeting concluded today. Our representatives Yin, Lei, and Xue are scheduled to return to Tianjin on the 7th and then come to Ping to report the details to He and Huang. This Dalian meeting was of a preliminary consultation nature. The issues discussed will only serve as a basis for diplomatic negotiations. Formal signing will only take place in the future when Chinese and Japanese representatives hold a formal meeting. Foreign telegrams reported that the three representatives had signed an agreement with the Japanese side, which the Military Branch has denied because the three representatives do not have the authority to sign agreements with foreign countries. Their mission is only to negotiate the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway and the absorption of the Luan East puppet army. These have been largely agreed upon: (1) The Beining Railway will restore traffic from Yu to Guan and implement joint operations with the puppet Fengshan Railway. Traffic will resume after the Beining Railway and Fengshan Railway have agreed on joint operation methods; (2) Regarding the absorption of the puppet army, it was previously agreed that two-thirds would be dismissed and one-third would be absorbed and kept for reorganization. Absorption is limited to those with firearms. The absorbed puppet army will first be sent to Jixian, Baodi, and other areas far from the railway to await inspection and will be organized into security teams under the jurisdiction of the Hebei provincial government. The title of Li Jichun will be determined based on the number of people absorbed. The above agreements will be formally passed and signed at a formal meeting between Chinese and Japanese representatives in Tanggu in the near future. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The issues of the absorption of the Beiping puppet army and the resumption of traffic on the Beining Railway have been largely resolved after days of meetings between China and Japan in Dalian. Regarding the number of puppet troops, we proposed 5,000, while the other side demanded 8,000. It was decided to be between 5,000 and 8,000, limited to those with complete firearms. In the future, it is planned to reorganize them into a security police brigade. The administrative expenses and the title of Li Jichun after the absorption have not yet been fully decided. Once an agreement is reached, the puppet army will begin to withdraw from the railway line and move to Jixian, Qian'an, and other places for reorganization. The issue of traffic on the Beining Railway has been agreed upon, and it is expected that it will soon be possible to drive directly to Shanhaiguan. As for the joint cargo transport between Beining and the puppet Fengshan Railway, a formal signing ceremony between representatives of China and Japan will still be held in Tanggu after the Dalian talks have come to a conclusion. With the two issues of the puppet army and traffic resolved, the administrative takeover of the war zone should not be a problem. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Tongzhou reports that there are no Japanese or puppet troops within Yutian County. The county magistrate has not yet returned to his post. The county government has sent someone to investigate, but no definite news has been returned. A telegram from Lutai reports that the puppet troops in Ludong and Ninghe are still holding their original positions and have not moved. When the Beining train arrives in Tangshan, that unit sends a team to the station to maintain order. Someone from Miyun reported that Japanese troops in Miyun have been checking pedestrians very strictly in recent days for unknown reasons. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese division commander previously completed consultations in Dalian on the deployment of Japanese troops. It was decided that the Kumamoto 6th Division would be stationed on the puppet Fengshan Railway and Datong Road lines between Shenyang and Shanhaiguan, the entire Nishi Yoshiichi 8th Division would be stationed in Rehe, the Hirose 10th Division and the Matsumoto 14th Division would be transferred to northern Manchuria to defend against Russia, and the Hattori 14th Mixed Brigade would be transferred back to Japan for reorganization. Using the six passes of the Great Wall as an excuse, troops must be stationed to maintain the defense line of Manchukuo. It is not yet known whether Japanese or puppet troops will be stationed in the future. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from Hebei is divided into two routes of rearward movement: one route retreating directly from Miyun and Ji to Rehe, and the other route moving along the Miyun, Ji, and Tangshan highways out of the pass and concentrating in Jinzhou. Currently, there are still some Japanese troops in the Sa County, Daohua, and Santunying areas, which can be withdrawn within about a few days. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Shunyi reports that at about 1:00 PM yesterday, Tang Jidong, the puppet county magistrate of Huairou, brought two Japanese soldiers to Banqiao Village in the 6th District of the county and summoned the chief of the Public Security Bureau and the district chief to Huairou for a meeting. He intended to place the entire 6th District under the jurisdiction of Huairou. The district chief and branch chief did not dare to appear and fled to the county to report. The county government is requesting instructions on how to deal with it. The 40 to 50 Japanese troops stationed in Huairou County were withdrawn a few days ago, and a small team of Japanese soldiers has now been sent. It is said that the previous withdrawal was a rotation of troops. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Telegram from Tongzhou: There are no traces of Japanese troops in Tongzhou, Sanhe, Jixian, Xianghe, Yutian, and other places. 40 to 50 Japanese troops are stationed in the Santunying area east of Zunhua. A unit of Japanese troops is also stationed in Huairou. The majority of the Japanese troops have withdrawn to the vicinity of the Great Wall line, but a unit of infantry is guarding the Luan River's Sa River Bridge. The front of the Japanese troops in Miyun has retreated, but the two wings are still holding their original positions. Two artillery teams of Japanese troops are still stationed near Miyun. Japanese tanks often travel between Miyun and the Great Wall line. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Sino-Japanese conference in Dalian was completed yesterday. Yin Tong, a representative of the Beiping Military Branch, Li Jichun, commander of the miscellaneous troops in Luan East, and Okamura, a representative of the Kwantung Army, have signed an agreement to return the areas without troops in the Luan River to China, and the Japanese army will withdraw to the Great Wall. It is also stipulated that the management rights of the railway from Beiping to Shanhaiguan will be returned to the railway bureau. The agreement also contains measures for the disposal of Chinese soldiers in the areas without troops. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities issued a public statement tonight stating that the purpose of sending representatives to Dalian was to negotiate the resumption of railway services on the Beining Railway and to deal with the miscellaneous troops in the Luan East area. No conference was convened, and the representatives were not authorized to sign any agreements. So far, an agreement has been reached on the resumption of traffic on the Beining Railway. As for the disposal of the miscellaneous troops, Chinese and Japanese representatives have roughly agreed to dismiss two-thirds of them, and the rest will be incorporated into the security teams of the Luan East area. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Chinese and Japanese representatives at the Dalian conference reached a consensus on the disposal of Li Jichun's army. The representatives and their entourage gathered at the Dalian Gendarmerie at 3:00 PM for a final consultation. After the consultation, the representatives of both parties signed a memorandum. The signing ceremony was held in the afternoon. First, Staff Officer Okamura of the Kwantung Army delivered a speech, followed by Chinese representative Yin Tong and a representative of Li's army. Finally, everyone raised their glasses, took commemorative photos, and the meeting ended successfully. (5th Nihon Rengo Telegram)</p>
<p>Chiang Approves Guangdong to Absorb Three Warships, Chen Jitang Orders Three Warships to Enter the Guangdong River</p>
<h3 id="e3">Zeng Yiding is Handling Procedures for Taking Over the Northeast Fleet <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Regarding the absorption of three warships, Chen Jitang telegraphed Chairman Chiang for instructions. It is said that he has received a reply, temporarily approving the absorption. Chen Jitang has now ordered the three warships to enter the Guangdong River at 6:00 PM on the 6th. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The three warships Haiqi and others are temporarily anchored in the Chinese waters near the port. The captains of the three warships came to Hong Kong on the 5th to meet with Fang Nianzu, the representative he sent to Guangdong for absorption. That evening, they sent a long telegram to Chen Jitang requesting permission to station in Yulin Port, Qionghai, and also raised the issue of funding and coal supply. The political council held a meeting on the morning of the 6th to discuss response measures, but it is said that Chen Jitang intends not to absorb them because the Guangdong treasury is stretched thin. He only telegraphed the central government and the Military Affairs Commission for mediation and advised the three ships to return north to their fleet. (6th Special Dispatch) (Hong Kong) The three warships Haiqi and others docked at the mouth of the Pearl River on the night of the 5th. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zeng Yiding said that the three warships Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohe left Hong Kong for Guangzhou yesterday afternoon. It has not yet been confirmed whether they have defected to the Southwest. It is also possible that the three warships decided to defect to the Southwest after leaving Qingdao. However, Chen Jitang has refused to absorb them. The Ministry of the Navy has now sent personnel to Guangdong to persuade the officers of the three warships to return to Qingdao and not to cause further complications. The Northeast Fleet has never been under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy, resulting in a distorted state, which is unacceptable in terms of national dignity. Now, the central government plans to take the opportunity to unify the command of the Northeast Fleet by the Ministry of the Navy, so he was sent to Ping to handle this matter. Since the Northeast Fleet is under the jurisdiction of the Ping Military Branch, it is necessary to consult with He on everything. The Northeast Fleet, in addition to the three escaped warships, also has other small warships, and it is expected that there will be no problems that cannot be resolved peacefully. As for where they will be stationed in the future after being transferred to the Ministry of the Navy, it has not yet been determined. He came here on the orders of the Ministry and is currently negotiating with He on the takeover. If things go smoothly, he will not go to Qingdao and will return directly to Beijing from Ping. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Shen Honglie telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, He Yingqin, and Huang Fu again, resigning from his post as mayor of Qingdao. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The three warships Haiqi and others arrived at Humen at 10:00 PM on the 5th. He Yingqin sent a telegram to Shen Honglie saying: "I have received a secret telegram from President Wang stating that the Haiqi and other warships seem to have gone to Shantou. Brother Cheng Zhang has repeatedly telegraphed requesting to resign from his position as naval commander. The National Defense Conference approved it on the 4th, and the Executive Yuan has announced it. However, you are still retained as the mayor of Qingdao. As for whether the remaining warships in Qingdao can be handed over to the Ministry of the Navy after consulting with Brother Cheng Zhang, please reply accordingly. Your brother, Yingqin." Shen replied to He: "I have received your telegram stating that President Wang has approved my resignation as naval commander. I am extremely grateful to be relieved of my responsibilities. As for the remaining warships, they were originally under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission and the钧 Council. Where they should belong in the future is at your discretion. I still earnestly request that you quickly appoint someone to take over so that I can follow orders and handle everything. Shen Honglie respectfully kowtows." (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Soviet Union and Puppet Representatives Argue Over Ownership; Negotiations on the CER Become Increasingly Fractured <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Bringing Up Old Issues; Both Sides Show Anger</p>
<p>In Addition to the Vastly Different Prices, Another Hidden Obstacle is Encountered</p>
<p>Japan Prepares to Protect the Puppet and Seize the Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the fourth meeting on the sale of the CER, the Russian representative first made a direct declaration, stating that the Soviet Union retains ownership of the CER, which was a major bombshell to the "Manchukuo" side. The "Manchukuo" side also denied the entire declaration, stating that what "Manchukuo" had bought from the Russian side was only the abstract right to manage the railway. Therefore, since the meeting opened on May 26th, it has only been 10 days and only four meetings have been held, but it has already encountered a hidden obstacle. The Russian representative, Ambassador Shen Lifu, brought up the main purpose of establishing a joint CER committee at the Washington Conference in 1922, as well as the discussions between Japanese representative Tsuneo Matsudaira and Chinese representative Yan Huiqing, and the 1924 Beijing-Fengtian agreements, arguing for the existence of Soviet ownership. Ding Shiyuan and Vice Minister Ohashi of the "Manchukuo" side refuted this, saying that the Soviet Union's rights to the CER, since the declarations issued by Karakhan in 1919 and 1920, and the establishment of the Beijing-Fengtian agreements, were merely China's recognition of the Russian side's management rights. Vice Minister Ohashi was particularly angry at the Russian side for bringing up old materials from the Washington Conference and accused them of insincerity. He said to the Russian representatives, "You are representatives of 'Manchukuo,' but you are bringing up facts that have nothing to do with the current issue, so how should we deal with the old debts of hundreds of millions of rubles that Japan lent to Russia during the imperial era?" Upon hearing this, the Russian representatives changed their expressions. Kezhniakov, the Far East minister who has been stationed in the Far East for many years and leads the Russian delegation, angrily exclaimed, "You are a representative of 'Manchukuo,' but you are bringing up facts that have nothing to do with the issue at hand, which is an insult to the Russian representatives!" The atmosphere at the meeting became extremely tense for a while. Vice Minister Ohashi then proposed that the two sides conduct informal negotiations in the future in the hope of a satisfactory resolution. The Russian representatives requested a temporary adjournment and deliberated in a separate room. After 50 minutes, they said to the Manchurian representatives, "The 'Manchukuo' representatives seem to misunderstand the Soviet Union's love of peace and are proceeding with the discussion with an attitude of not recognizing the Soviet Union's ownership of the CER. This kind of discussion is really useless." They demanded a suspension of the meeting. Thus, the fourth meeting experienced a major disturbance and temporarily closed after four and a half hours.

<h3 id="e6">Another Statement by the Soviet Union <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet representative made the following statement on the ownership of the CER at yesterday's CER meeting: (1) The Beijing Agreement and the Fengtian Agreement clearly state that the Soviet government is the owner of the CER. In a note submitted to the Soviet government by "Manchukuo" on March 12, 1932, "Manchukuo" also promised to abide by the two agreements regarding the CER. Article 7 and Article 12 of Article 1 of the Fengtian Agreement and Article 7 and Article 12 of Article 1 of the Beijing Agreement all stipulate that the final decision-making power on the reform of the CER's financial issues belongs to the Soviet Union. During the Washington Conference, although the participating countries had no normal relations with the Soviet Union, the participating representatives, in addition to acknowledging the Soviet Union's relationship with the CER, Representative Matsudaira clearly explained to the Chinese representatives in the minutes of the Washington Conference that the CER was Soviet property. According to the above, it is very clear that the CER belongs to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the sale negotiations must proceed on the only natural basis of legal ownership. The Soviet delegation is confident that "Manchukuo" will approach with sincerity, and the Japanese government will also proceed with the discussion on the basis of the above indisputable facts.

<h3 id="e7">Lengthy Rebuttal by the Puppet State <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) "Manchukuo" issued the following statement yesterday during the fourth consultation on the transfer of the CER: "Although the Soviet Union's premise is that the CER and all its property are wholly and solely owned by the Soviet Federation, there is no such text in any treaty regarding the CER. Even referring to the so-called two Karakhan Declarations of June 25, 1916, and September 27, 1920, and even assuming that the CER belonged to the Soviet Union before these declarations, the Soviet Union had already relinquished its ownership for the benefit of China after the declarations. This observation is most appropriate. Now, even assuming that the argument of sole Soviet ownership is credible, according to the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements, the Soviet Union and China jointly manage the railway on an equal footing, with profits split in half, and within the next thirty years, it must be entirely transferred to 'Manchukuo' free of charge. Based on such ownership, it is absolutely impossible to recognize the total price demanded for the CER. The Soviet Union claims that the reason for calculating the price is the depletion of Soviet people's resources, but this is the result of the Soviet imperial era's invasion of the Far East and the construction of this railway regardless of losses. It is difficult to understand why it now wants 'Manchukuo' to bear the responsibility for this expenditure. Although the Soviet Union claims that the financial situation of the CER is good, with operating income exceeding expenditures by more than 140 million gold rubles since the beginning of joint management until 1930, an investigation of the CER's statistical annual report shows that the average profit in seven years is only 7.5 million gold rubles. There is no basis for the pure profit recorded by the Soviet Union. In short, the price demanded by the Soviet Union is absolutely impossible to pay. The limit of the price that 'Manchukuo' can pay is only 50 million yuan." (6th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japan Prepares to Seize the Railway <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The transfer conditions proposed by Russia and "Manchukuo" for the CER are very far apart. According to the current situation, it is difficult to resolve unless one side makes a substantial concession. In the event of a breakdown, "Manchukuo" has decided to operate the CER independently after clarifying that the responsibility lies with the Soviet Union, as a temporary measure. The Japanese Foreign Ministry will also provide support based on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. (6th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of four meetings between the "Manchukuo" side and the Russian side to negotiate the sale of the Eastern Railway, the "Manchukuo" side has a slight understanding of where the Russian side's intentions lie. Therefore, it is determined to prepare to respond to its actions. That is, although the Russian side superficially insists that the current sale negotiation is a commercial act, in reality, it wants to expand its rights and interests in the Eastern Railway through this negotiation. That is, the Russian side specifically declared its ownership of the Soviet Union and also publicized its investment in the Eastern Railway as 41.1 million rubles. In view of the Soviet Union's attitude, "Manchukuo" has decided to suppress the Soviet Union in the local area. The specific measures include cutting off the connection between the Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway and reforming the internal system of the Eastern Railway Administration to counter the Soviet Union's actions regarding the Beijing-Fengtian agreements.

<h3 id="e9">Observations of the Japanese Military <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military has the following observations on ways to overcome the difficulties in the apparently fracturing negotiations between Russia and "Manchukuo" over the sale of the CER: (1) The prices claimed by both sides are too far apart. If the Russian side insists on this price, there is no solution. However, in future negotiations, the calculation method used by the Soviet Union when negotiating the sale of fishing grounds with Japan can be adopted. If each ruble is calculated as 0.35 Japanese yen, the Russian selling price of 250 million rubles would be equivalent to 70-80 million Japanese yen, which is slightly closer to the "Manchukuo" claimed purchase price. Then, there is still hope for the negotiation. (2) The discussion of the ownership issue at the fourth meeting only aggravated the emotions of both sides. In future meetings, Japan should advise both sides to seek a political solution. (3) However, the Soviet Union's attitude at the meeting is to make "Manchukuo" recognize the Soviet Union's ownership. If the Soviet Union continues this attitude, there is very little hope for the future of the meeting. (6th Nihon Rengo Telegram)</p>

<p>Various Armies Ordered to Round Up Xu's Bandits</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The chiefs of staff of various Sichuan armies who went to Jiangxi to attend the bandit suppression conference have completed their tasks and have arrived in Nanjing one after another. They include Zhu Lianheng, chief of staff of the 20th Army; Zhang Boyan, chief of staff of the 24th Army; Wang Baosheng, chief of staff of the 28th Army; and Long Jiesan, chief of staff of the 29th Army. They will separately visit the ministers and senior officials of the Military Affairs Commission and the military administration and staff departments. According to Zhu Lianheng, he participated in the bandit suppression conference in Jiangxi and received instructions from Chairman Chiang on a plan. As the Red Bandit Xu Xiangqian's band has infiltrated Sichuan, various armies are now diligently rounding up the bandits in accordance with Chairman Chiang's plan. Chiang repeatedly warned the Sichuan generals to quickly stop the civil war and not create opportunities for the Red Bandits. The various armies should unite sincerely and jointly suppress the bandits. The central government recently appointed Liu Xiang as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression, controlling the Sichuan army. However, the troops of Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou are still facing off against each other, and although various armies have come forward to mediate, it has been difficult to achieve results. Observing Liu Wenhui's attitude, it seems that he has no intention of repenting. Therefore, Liu Xiang's opinion is that to suppress the bandits, it is first necessary to pacify Sichuan. The first step is to use force against Liu Wenhui, the second step is to unify the Sichuan army and work together to suppress the bandits, and the third step is to abolish the defense zone system and unify Sichuan's military and political affairs. He will go to Shanghai within days and return to Sichuan soon. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Still Based on the Original Principle of Peace, Sending Personnel to Persuade Feng</p>
<p>(Beiping) At today's regular meeting of the Xiang He Military Branch, two steps were decided for resolving the Chahar issue. On one hand, still based on the original principle of peace, personnel will be sent to Feng to persuade him to abolish the commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Song hopes that the situation in Chahar can still be resolved peacefully and expresses no other opinions, but only listens to the government's orders. Song invited Deng Zhexu and Li Xin, but they both did not come to Ping. Ping Fang will send personnel to Chahar separately to give Feng friendly persuasion, hoping he will understand the government's difficulties and end everything. Peace in Chahar seems not to be hopeless. Yan has also begun to help mediate the Chahar situation. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chahar situation has been deadlocked since Li Qi returned to Ping. Although various private parties are still constantly working hard, in fact, there has been no progress whatsoever. The central government previously telegraphed Ping, expressing extreme anxiety about the internal complexities of Chahar Province, saying that if it is delayed any further, the future will inevitably become more difficult to handle, and urgently hopes to seek a new way to resolve it in a hopeless situation in accordance with the originally planned peaceful policy. Sun Dianying's troops stationed in Huailai, Shahe, and Chicheng are scheduled to mostly gather between the 5th and 7th and can set off for Qing Province around the 10th. This matter has considerable efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation. Deng Zhexu and Li Qi are still staying in Tianjin and have no news of coming to Ping. There is also no news of Kong Xiangxi coming north. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

Li told reporters that he advocates thoroughly resisting foreign aggression but will never participate in the civil war. He hopes that the people of the country will eliminate private opinions and form a strong and powerful government, which can deal with not only Japan but also any country. Whether he will go to Singapore will be determined after arriving in Beijing. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Start of Negotiations Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union has rashly proposed the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway to the puppet state without regard for the wishes of its rightful owner, a point we have repeatedly lamented. Now, this proposal has advanced to formal discussions. While our nation is constrained by military limitations and cannot impose sanctions, it remains uncertain whether Japan and the Soviet Union can achieve substantial progress or whether their diplomacy can transform their previous confrontational stance into a new path. In our estimation, the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union remains adversarial. Japan's encouragement of the puppet state to negotiate this railway sale stems from a desire to elevate the puppet state's international standing and alleviate its own difficulties. Even if the railway transaction fails, Japan will not suffer any losses. Furthermore, dual diplomacy has always been one of Japan's tactics. By not assuming direct responsibility for this matter, Japan retains greater flexibility. After the commencement of the Soviet-puppet negotiations in Tokyo, the Soviet Union immediately proposed ceding to the Manchurian puppet regime the Chinese Eastern Railway's main and branch lines, totaling 1,069 miles, along with its rolling stock and all other properties. The estimated value is approximately 250 million gold rubles. The Soviet Union's assertion of such a substantial price is based on the fact that the Chinese Eastern Railway is the primary artery connecting Europe and Asia and holds significant political value in northern Manchuria. Once controlled by the puppet state and manipulated by Japan, the political gains would be many times greater than they are today. Secondly, the Chinese Eastern Railway traverses Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and the Heilong River basin in northern Manchuria remains largely undeveloped. Considering the economic value along the eastern route, it is still in its nascent stages. Therefore, despite various obstacles such as warfare and floods in the past year, the Chinese Eastern Railway still generated a surplus of over 11 million rubles. Even from a purely economic perspective, it should possess substantial value.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese perspective is quite different. Based on the conditions proposed by their puppet, the price offered to the Soviet Union is merely 50 million Japanese yen, with plans to implement the takeover in three months. Furthermore, they repeatedly assert that Japan will construct a railway network in the three eastern provinces, and with the Jihui Railway nearing completion, the economic value of the Chinese Eastern Railway will soon diminish. Otherwise, Japan could also direct the puppet to forcibly seize the railway, and the Soviet Union would likely be unable to do anything about it. Such is Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union, viewing the Chinese Eastern Railway as worthless.</p>
<p>Therefore, the transaction for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, though negotiated by the Soviet Union and the puppet state in Tokyo, has an uncertain outcome at present. However, based on our observation of the general situation, since encompassing the three northeastern provinces, Japan has achieved a temporary military victory, but the stability of Manchuria remains questionable. In terms of international diplomacy, Japan's imperialistic actions have led to increasing isolation. Even the long-standing alliance between Britain and Japan is now facing intense economic competition. The sharp increase in tariffs in India, Australia, South Africa, and other regions is clear evidence of this. The Chinese people's hatred towards Japan is deeply ingrained in the hearts of the general populace, which the Japanese are undoubtedly aware of. Therefore, today, they must make every effort to explore new avenues in diplomacy. In addition to offering sugar-coated poison to our country, they prioritize winning the favor of the Soviet Union. If this Chinese Eastern Railway transaction succeeds, the Soviet Union will not only recognize Japan's seizure of the three northeastern provinces as a fait accompli but will also engage in direct negotiations with the Manchurian puppet regime. Since we cannot impose any practical sanctions, and the Soviet Union recognizes their illegal actions, Japan's gains from aggression will become even more stable. The so-called "Manchukuo" will then acquire a considerable international standing, becoming a second Outer Mongolia. This cannot be considered anything but a diplomatic victory for Japan. The Soviet Union in the Far East will inevitably find itself in an increasingly difficult situation, as its main intention in ceding the Chinese Eastern Railway is to exchange it for peace. Little does it know that Japan, having completed its plan to seize the three northeastern provinces, will implement its continental policy from there. The power of Japanese militarism will continue to grow, and the resources for its military industries will become even more abundant. By applying advanced industrial technology to the development of Manchuria, it is feared that Japan will be able to dominate the Far East and restrict the Soviet Union's development in less than five years. Therefore, the Soviet Union's diplomatic success with Central European countries, even if it achieves peace victories and concludes non-aggression pacts, is merely a facade. It is nothing more than France using the Soviet Union as a barrier to resist the advance of German and Italian fascism, with no genuine love for peace. If, unfortunately, a major war breaks out, and we look back at historical facts, will the so-called sanctity of treaties not be reduced to ashes by artillery fire?</p>
<p>If so, the result of selling the Chinese Eastern Railway will only serve to bolster the viciousness of Japanese imperialism and increase its aggressive flames. The peace hoped for by the Soviet Union will ultimately become illusory, and what will be the position of our country, as the true owner?</p>
<p>The Economic Conference Ends in Failure</p>
<p>Roosevelt's New Declaration Fails to Break the Deadlock</p>
<p>Only an Extension of the Conference, to be Determined by the Steering Committee</p>
<h3 id="e16">Moret Leaves England Last Night to Return Home <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(London) Another indication of the standstill of the World Economic Conference is the rumored preparation by the conference secretariat to leave on Saturday. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Since the opening of the World Economic Conference, the atmosphere in the conference venue has never been as lively as it is today. The lounges are filled with delegates from various countries and journalists, all speculating about the proceedings of the closed-door meeting of the Steering Committee this morning at 11 o'clock. Many procedures remain to be carried out, and a definitive decision will not be made until the afternoon. As the situation stands, it appears that a plenary session will be convened tomorrow to formally announce the adjournment of the conference, to be reconvened several months later, most likely in Geneva, around October. Professor Moret, a trusted advisor to President Roosevelt, and U.S. Representative Swab will depart London for Plymouth tonight to return to the United States by ship, it is said.

<h3 id="e17">The Steering Committee Discusses Extension Methods <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The British Prime Minister Proposes a Motion in His Capacity as Chairman</p>
<p>To Avoid Placing Responsibility on Any One Country</p>
<p>(London) The Steering Committee of the Economic Conference, comprising 16 nations – Argentina, Britain, Canada, China, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United States, and Soviet Russia – met this morning in the Secretariat to discuss methods for extending the conference. The meeting lasted for quite some time, and had not adjourned as of 1 p.m., with no official announcement released.</p>
<p>The British Prime Minister proposed a motion, reportedly by Prime Minister MacDonald in his capacity as Chairman of the Guidance Committee of the conference, to avoid placing the responsibility for the extension on any one country. It is believed that the Steering Committee will continue to meet during lunchtime in an effort to complete its work in one session.</p>
<p>No Results from the Morning Session; It was soon rumored that there were no results, and the meeting was temporarily adjourned to reconvene at 3 p.m. The representatives appeared worried as they left the venue. When reporters asked French Finance Minister Bonnet for his opinion on the future prospects, he merely shrugged his shoulders and declined to answer. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett stated, "I do not believe there is any question of brightness or darkness at present. We are merely adjourning for lunch, and there is nothing beneficial I can say at this time."</p>
<p>The Canadian Prime Minister Opposes the Extension; Mr. Bennett, representing the British autonomous territories, strongly argued that the conference should not be extended. He firmly stated to a Reuters reporter that the conference should not be extended without a vote from the plenary session. However, this opinion was not shared by others, who believed that the Steering Committee's resolution could be implemented without a plenary session. The Economic Conference is not the same as the League of Nations Assembly and has no fixed rules. It is rumored that Prime Minister MacDonald intends to use this point to resolve the dispute in a secret meeting to avoid publicizing the dissenting opinions of various parties, which would hinder the second convocation later this year.</p>
<p>Only Ten Countries Attended; According to the official announcement, only ten of the sixteen countries participating in the Steering Committee's discussions were present: the United States (Hull), Japan (Ishii), Italy (Jang), Sweden (Wigforss), France (Bonnet), Britain (Chamberlain), the Netherlands (Colijn), Canada (Bennett), China (Yan Huiqing), and Spain (Dulwa). It is rumored that this morning's discussions were quite chaotic due to the differing opinions of the representatives. Therefore, the actual outcome is currently difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Hull's Earnest Speech; U.S. Secretary of State Hull delivered an earnest speech, urging the continuation of the conference, stating that the hopes of the world's people rested on their shoulders and that they should not lose heart immediately due to a single setback. This statement was quite effective and garnered the support of Britain, Japan, and the British autonomous territories.</p>
<p>Various Conflicting Opinions; During the Steering Committee's lunchtime adjournment, a draft proposal was discussed to allow the work of various committees to continue as usual, except for the monetary and related issues. Several members of the Steering Committee had lunch at the U.S. Embassy and continued these discussions. Regarding the opposition to the immediate extension without holding a plenary session, a compromise solution has been proposed to expand the Steering Committee by adding the chairmen of various committees. However, it seems absolutely certain that the entire conference will be extended, and not just the monetary committee, although some committees will not be affected. The Exchange Market Unaffected; The breakdown of the conference seems to have had no impact on the exchange market. The U.S. dollar opened today at 4.50 yuan, then returned to 4.475 yuan, but soon fell again to 4.505 yuan. Gold coins remained strong. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Steering Committee of the Economic Conference met this morning at 10 o'clock and adjourned at 1:30 p.m. to reconvene at 4 p.m. for a final decision on the fate of the conference.</p>
<p>Like Jurors Deadlocked; When the meeting opened this morning, the members were like jurors who had reached a deadlock, but ham toast and fine wine were summoned several times. However, according to reporters, none of the sixteen members publicly advocated for a formal adjournment.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's Proposal; British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain attempted to break the deadlock by proposing a draft resolution suggesting (1) that various committees and subcommittees continue their work, decide what they can accomplish, and then report to the Economic and Monetary Committees; (2) that a plenary session be convened before the end of July; and (3) that the Steering Committee continue to meet once a week.</p>
<p>Rejected by Italy and France; French Finance Minister Bonnet and Italian Foreign Minister Janck both directly rejected Chamberlain's plan. However, both men, representing gold standard countries, declared their opposition to a formal adjournment and their support for continuing the conference, insisting that monetary issues and other related issues such as tariffs not be discussed further.</p>
<p>Our Country's Position; In addition, Chinese representative Yan Huiqing, Japanese chief representative Ishii, Dutch Minister Colijn, Swedish representative Wigforss, and Spanish representative Dulwa also delivered speeches. China and Japan both supported continuing the conference.</p>
<p>A Drafting Committee Was Elected; Before the adjournment, a drafting subcommittee was elected to prepare a written proposal to be presented at the Steering Committee meeting at 4 p.m. Both supporters and opponents of Chamberlain's proposal were selected for the drafting committee. Seeking a Reasonable Approach; It is reported that there is general agreement within the Steering Committee that the conference should continue if a satisfactory way to remove the current obstacles can be found. Currently, this approach is being sought by the drafting committee. According to the majority opinion, the most reasonable approach would be to allow the Economic and Monetary Committees to independently decide their own procedures, so that the Monetary Committee could temporarily adjourn and the Economic Committee could proceed freely.

<p>President Roosevelt's New Declaration</p>
<p>Reiterates That Monetary Issues Are Not the Fundamental Objective at Present</p>
<p>Determined to Cooperate with the Conference to First Seek the Recovery of World Prices</p>
<p>Urgent Stability of Currency Values Artificially</p>
<p>May Hinder the Country's Economic Recovery</p>
<p>The U.S. Has Not Yet Reached the Time to Return to the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Will Retain the Right to Choose the Future</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt issued a declaration today, which has been telegraphed to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. The declaration states that the President wishes the World Economic Conference to continue, and that the temporary disputes over stabilizing currency values cannot diminish the suitability of this discussion. The Conference should urgently seek to alleviate and remedy the pains of the current economic situation. The United States is determined to cooperate, and the revaluation of the gold standard for American goods is an objective that cannot be passively changed by the American public. Today, the United States has no intention of determining the value of the gold standard based on foreign currencies. In addition to stabilizing currency values, other major issues should also be explored. The primary task is to restore prices so that they are profitable and efficient for industrial and agricultural operations. The needs and policies of various countries do not necessarily align. Stabilizing their currency values uniformly today would be artificial and unrealistic, and may hinder other countries from realizing the policies necessary for their domestic prosperity. The declaration also clearly states that the United States' policies do not harm the interests of any country. It concludes by saying that when European currency values were lowered, the United States had no complaints. Like Britain, the United States views the restoration of the gold standard as its ultimate goal, but it must choose its own time and ratio. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) President Roosevelt's new declaration, telegraphed to Hull, states that the final exchange rate of the American gold standard depends on the success of other countries in raising prices. To achieve success in raising prices, the increased prices must be periodic currency units rather than other separately agreed units. Therefore, such prices cannot be predetermined. President Roosevelt then pointed out that the United States has never criticized France, Italy, and Belgium for adopting the policy of devaluing their currencies and has expressed sympathetic understanding for Britain and Scandinavia's abandonment of the gold standard. He declared that the United States fully agrees with the British government's statement in the House of Commons that Britain reserves the right to choose the timing of its return to the gold standard and the ratio of gold to its restoration. President Roosevelt also stated that the United States does not attempt to persuade various countries to adopt any particular domestic policy but maintains that the Economic Conference should lead the restoration of prices to a beneficial level and then maintain the stable prices obtained at this time.

<h3 id="e18">European Gold Standard Countries Unanimously Support the Extension <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Threatening to Withdraw from the Tariff Truce</p>
<p>(London) The Gold Standard countries held a meeting last night and unanimously passed a resolution to support the extension of the Economic Conference. This move by the Gold Standard countries will ensure that the Steering Committee's meeting today will resolve to extend the conference. The Gold Standard countries met at the French delegation's office for an hour and a half before reaching this decision. After the meeting, it was heard from the French legal circles that, in the opinion of the Gold Standard countries, President Roosevelt's recent remarks, although making substantial progress, confirmed the Gold Standard countries' opinion that there are differences in monetary concepts between Europe and the United States, and it is difficult to seriously continue the work of the conference at present. However, the Gold Standard countries felt that President Roosevelt's remarks this time did have the intention of expecting closer and sympathetic cooperation, which was not found in previous American declarations. This time, the wording was very moderate, which could facilitate the continuation of future conference affairs after the extension of the conference. As for the issue of how long to extend the conference, the Gold Standard countries did not discuss it, as they felt that the currency issue could not be given a deadline. From the Gold Standard countries' point of view, the future changes in the U.S. dollar must be closely monitored. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) European representatives have failed to observe the American attitude in the same light. After the gold standard countries' representatives met at midnight today to discuss response plans, the French representatives immediately declared that the Economic Conference would be adjourned on Thursday. It is heard that several countries' representatives have notified secretaries and typists to prepare to leave London on Saturday. Although the adjournment plan has not yet been finalized, it is now believed that the Steering Committee will be asked to reconvene within 60 days to consider whether it is possible to reopen the conference. The representatives are not entirely in favor of adjournment, and the meeting is currently divided into two factions. (5th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) After seeing the U.S. President's final declaration, the representatives of the gold standard countries all believe that the Economic Conference has little hope of continuing and have declared that they will withdraw from the tariff truce of May 12 and return to a protectionist economic policy.

<p>(Paris) A meeting of countries adhering to the gold standard system will be held in Paris on Saturday, chaired by Moreau, Governor of the Bank of France. Participants will include the leaders of the central banks of Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, and Poland. The meeting will discuss the situation created by the United States' adoption of a position on currency stability and methods to curb speculation. The meeting will be purely for the exchange of views, and the actions of the representatives at the meeting will not bind the governments. Talks between the governments will take place after the meeting. (6th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Terpstra, Governor of the Netherlands National Bank in The Hague, announced again today that the Netherlands is determined to maintain the gold standard. Mr. Terpstra expressed his deep understanding of President Roosevelt's attitude expressed from the American position, saying that the U.S. President's primary concern is to protect the interests of the American business community. Conversely, as the Governor of the Netherlands National Bank, he should support the gold standard countries' plan, as these countries see currency stability as necessary for restoring world trade. (6th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) The Free City of Danzig has joined the gold group and has now formally announced its participation in the declaration of the European gold standard countries on July 3 to maintain the gold standard. It has also instructed the Danzig Central Bank to contact the central banks of the gold standard countries in order to actively implement this declaration. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>The U.S. Will Increase Tariffs to Restrict Imports</p>
<p>The British Industries League Opens an Imperial Economic Conference</p>
<p>(London) The Imperial Committee of the British Industries Federation has unanimously passed a recommendation advocating that an Imperial Economic Conference be convened in London in the event that the Economic Conference fails. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Tonight, after hearing the news that the U.S. President will soon prohibit the import of certain foreign goods, and that the Imperial Committee of the British Industries Federation has recommended reopening the Imperial Economic Conference after the failure of the Economic Conference, there are deep fears that Britain and the United States will completely revert to economic nationalism. After today's cabinet meeting, it was announced that the U.S. President will convene a meeting with the Director of Industrial Recovery, Johnson, and the Secretary of Commerce, Roper, on Thursday to discuss industrial policy. According to sources close to the President, he intends to shorten working hours, increase wages, and restrict production to meet national needs. If so, the import of foreign goods would be sufficient to hinder the success of this plan. Therefore, informed sources expect the President to soon impose additional tariffs on certain goods and prohibit the import of certain goods. (5th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States joined the League of Nations' 1927 convention on the abolition of import prohibitions and restrictions. The Washington government has recently notified the League of Nations that the United States is withdrawing from this convention. The U.S. government's intention is that this convention may hinder the plan to restore the domestic economy of the United States, and the State Department also believes that this convention has been ineffective up to now. Its declaration of withdrawal is due to this. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Premier Wang Issues a Statement</p>
<p>The Whole Country Should Have a Common Will and Unify Against External Forces</p>
<p>The Dalian Negotiations Still Adhere to the Principles of the Tanggu Truce</p>
<p>The Government Is Considering Concluding a Non-Aggression Treaty with Russia</p>
<p>Nanjing Wang Jingwei talked about, ㈠ After the signing of the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement, the rumors that Japan's plan to invade China intends to expand North China as a political and economic base are only seen in newspapers. Whether they are true remains to be verified. At this time of crisis, all leaders in the country should have a common will to strengthen national power and unite against external forces. Japan takes advantage of the disunity and differing political views of our country's leaders to sow discord. If foreign troubles are pressing, national power cannot be strengthened, and will cannot be unified, how can we talk about resistance, let alone friendliness? At this time, the people of the country should share weal and woe and unite for survival in order to save the current crisis. ㈡ The scope of the Dalian negotiations is limited to the restoration of traffic and the police guarding the railways.</p>
<p>However, Japan has violated the principles of the Tanggu Truce and made two unreasonable demands, which have naturally been rejected. This matter has been entrusted to the Pingzheng Committee and the Ping Military Branch to handle cautiously in accordance with the central government's intentions and the principles of the Tanggu Truce. We received a report last night that the Japanese side has room for change. In short, as long as the Japanese side does not violate the Tanggu Truce, there is the possibility of further discussions. ㈢ The free movement of the three warships Haiqi, Zhaohe, and Haishen is also an unfortunate event. The report states that they have already arrived in Hong Kong, and the central government is now sending a telegram to recall them and transfer them to the central government's command in order to unify the navy and ensure that the navy's strength is no longer divided. Therefore, after Mayor Shen resigned as the commander of the Northeast Fleet, it seems unnecessary to appoint another candidate. ㈣ The war between the two Lius is extremely distressing, and the alarms of the Red Disaster in northern Sichuan are frequent.</p>
<p>Both sides should cease fighting as soon as possible to save the crisis. Chairman Jiang has already telegraphed both sides to immediately return to their original defenses and restore the pre-war state. The Executive Yuan advocates continuing to proceed based on the four measures for governing Sichuan previously established to enable both sides to cease fighting and jointly suppress the bandits. ㈤ The government is still considering the mutual non-aggression and security pacts signed by the Soviet Russian government and its neighboring countries, and no decision has been made yet on whether or not to join them. ㈥ The nation's Chinese-owned yarn factories have all suspended night work due to sluggish sales, and labor-management disputes are bound to arise again. The central government is studying a method that takes into account the interests of both labor and management to provide relief. ㈦ The sudden adjournment of the World Economic Conference held in London is shocking. This conference is of great importance to the stability of the world's finance, so it is highly valued by all countries in the world. ㈧ The affairs of Chahar Province are entirely handled by the Pingzheng Committee and the Ping Military Branch nearby.</p>
<p>So far, they have embraced the four words of peaceful handling. ㈨ The central government attaches great importance to the claim that the puppet state has allocated more than 13 million yuan to suppress the volunteer armies. The volunteer armies hiding in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are numerous and are a real worry for the rebels. However, judging from the situation, it will not be easy.

Inquiries with personnel from the new Xinjiang provincial government stationed in Nanjing revealed that this was not the case. Gong Bicheng stated that the matter was a false rumor. However, the Nanjing office of the Special Envoy's office stated that Huang was placed under "invisible surveillance" upon arriving in Xinjiang and that the office had not received any telegrams from Huang since the 28th. They also claimed that outgoing telegrams may not have reached him, suggesting that his surveillance was undoubtedly true. Another report stated that Huang recently sent a telegram to a friend in Nanjing, requesting that they urge the government to appoint Liu Wenlong as Chairman and Sheng Shicai as Military Governor, so that the Special Envoy's mission could be easily completed. He also requested that they contact an airline to arrange for a plane to come so that he could return east. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gong Bicheng from Nanjing said that he and Peng Zhaoxian are scheduled to fly to Xinjiang on the 11th. The central government has ordered Huang Musong to return to Nanjing as quickly as possible. Liu and Sheng are supported by the people and are in charge of military and political affairs, so they are still able to live together in harmony. The central government was extremely shocked when it received the news from the new Xinjiang authorities about the execution of Tao Mingyue and others. It immediately telegraphed Liu and Sheng, instructing them to act cautiously. A reply was received on the 6th, stating that this action was an emergency measure. The new province of Xinjiang would still follow the instructions of the central government. In his personal opinion, Gong believed that Xinjiang is related to border defense. Improper handling could invite foreign aggression, so caution is necessary. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huang Musong of Nanjing telegraphed Wang on the 6th, replying that he will return to Nanjing by Eurasia plane within the next few days. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>An official in Nanjing said that since the previous incident in Xinjiang, the central government believed that it was extremely important to eliminate the situation in Xinjiang as soon as possible, as the country was facing a serious national crisis. Chiang and Wang repeatedly exchanged telegrams to discuss the matter before deciding to send Huang Musong as a Special Envoy. Since arriving in Xinjiang, Huang has not been surrounded by any party or protected any one side to create a certain faction. Unexpectedly, someone took hold of Huang's name as Special Envoy and suppressed everything, resulting in the killing of three important officials. Wang summoned Zhang Mingjiu and Gong Bicheng to discuss the matter. In addition to telegraphing Liu and Sheng not to escalate the situation, Gong Bicheng and Peng Zhaoxian were ordered to go to Xinjiang as soon as possible to investigate the truth. During the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 7th, the members had a detailed discussion and still adhered to the principle of peace to determine an appropriate solution. As for the government's telegram urging Huang Musong to return to Nanjing, it was sent on the 5th. It is reported that Huang will wait for Gong and Peng to arrive in Xinjiang, consult with them briefly, and then return to Nanjing. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Mingjiu, the director of the Xinjiang Provincial Government's office in Nanjing, is scheduled to go to Jiangxi on the 7th to meet with Chiang, report on the recent handling of Tao Mingyue and others by the new Xinjiang provincial government, and ask Chiang for his opinion on the Xinjiang situation in order to resolve it quickly and avoid a stalemate.

<p>Bai Tianmin, the Brigade Commander who stubbornly defended Yihuang, arrived in Nanchang Hospital from the front line on the 5th due to a foot injury. Before his hospitalization, Bai discussed the battle with a reporter from the Central News Agency as follows: His brigade was ordered to depart on the 3rd of last month, arrived in Yihuang on the 4th, took over defense on the 5th, and encountered bandit ambush on the 6th. He led his troops to meet the enemy. The bandits, seeing our weakness, attacked with all their forces, so he decided to enter the city and defend it to the death. At that time, the main force of the bandits launched a fierce attack on them, lasting three days and nights, without success. They then mobilized the pseudo-5th Army Corps to encircle and attack, and the pseudo-1st Army Corps changed to harass Fuzhou. The bandit army planned to capture Yihuang and Chongren, take Fuzhou, and then advance south to Nanchang. Only 2,000 people were defending the city, so while requesting assistance, they resisted the enemy. The siege was only relieved when reinforcements arrived. Recalling the period of encirclement, the bandits attacked every day, with seven major battles and countless minor battles. It is estimated that the bandits lost one division commander, two regimental commanders, and over 3,000 soldiers. They suffered over 600 casualties among officers and soldiers. He was also injured because he encouraged his subordinates to fight the bandits to the death. He will return to the defense line to kill bandits after his injury heals.

<p>Regarding Song Ziwen's request to the League of Nations to send experts to implement technical cooperation with China in preparation for establishing a model province plan, the central government has not yet received Song's official report.

He is tasked with informally studying the issue of US recognition of the Soviet Union, paying particular attention to communist propaganda and Russian debts to the US. Russia owes the US a total of 57.3 million US dollars, of which 40 million US dollars were borrowed during the Tsarist era, and the remainder was owed by the Kerensky Provisional Government. The Soviet government denied this debt after its establishment.

<p>London, 5th - According to a National Dispatch, the treaty between the Soviet Union and Lithuania interpreting the meaning of "aggressor" was signed today at the Soviet Embassy in London by Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov and Lithuanian Ambassador to London, Jurgis Šaulys. This treaty is the same in intent and wording as the treaty signed by the Soviet Union with other countries on July 3rd. The reason why the Soviet Union signed this treaty separately with Lithuania this time is that Lithuania and Poland have been in a state of diplomatic rupture for several years, so the two countries could not sign the same treaty text. Now that this organization of peace treaties is in place, the entire western border of the Soviet Union will not be subject to any unwarranted aggression.</p>

<p>(London) Tonight, during the House of Commons debate on the Foreign Affairs Budget, Opposition Leader Lansbury strongly criticized Japan's policy in the Far East. Lansbury asked, "Who is now protecting the interests of British nationals in 'Manchukuo'? Japan has torn up various treaties, swept through Manchuria, and advanced!" Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain rose and declared that Lansbury was too focused on League of Nations sanctions and that he himself wished to focus on preventing mistakes. When the Far Eastern incident occurred, he expressed his deep sympathy for Japan. He felt that the League of Nations was too unsympathetic to the difficulties Japan faced due to internal unrest in China. However, after the incident was prolonged, we dare to conclude that Japan itself has greatly increased its mistakes. Its actions in Manchuria are in direct contradiction to the three solemn international treaties it has signed. Chamberlain then asked the government whether the recommendations of the Lytton Commission could not be applied to "Manchukuo" so as to cause no loss to Japanese interests and Chinese sovereignty. (Reuters Report, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain spoke out against Germany's treatment of Jews during the House of Commons debate on the Foreign Affairs Budget tonight, saying, "How can Britain remain friends with a country that treats another nation outside the protection of the law because of racial relations?" The spirit expressed by Germany is harmful to any country outside its borders and to any nation in Germany's future colonies. Unless Germany expresses a moderate and appropriate way that it can accept to revise the Treaty of Versailles, anyone who allows Germany to consider any modification as possible is an enemy of peace. Conservative Party member Rune expressed the opinion that China could welcome any friendly act that would help it reorganize its government. Cannot the United States, Japan, France, and Britain unite to do something? Undersecretary of State Eden replied to Lansbury, saying that the League of Nations has no reason to be ashamed of its performance. The League of Nations is not an emperor and cannot exceed its authority. As for the arms embargo on the Far East, all countries do not have equal legislative power to strictly enforce the embargo. All countries must have this power before a unified ban on arms exports can be considered. As for Britain's interests in Manchuria, although Britain has not recognized "Manchukuo," it has stationed consular staff. Eden went on to talk about disarmament, acknowledging that there are indeed dangers in signing a disarmament convention at the moment, but said that there are also dangers in not agreeing to this convention. Therefore, Europe must first be comforted to have sufficient trust to sign this convention. This matter requires the assistance of all of Europe, and the assistance of countries that speak of unequal status is especially important. Foreign Minister Simon, in concluding the debate, spoke of the war debts owed to the United States, saying that negotiations would be held soon, but the date had not yet been determined. The negotiations will cover the entire war debt, not just one installment of the debt. The US President has already explained this. The UK and the US are now going to revise the existing agreements to adapt to the recovery of prosperity. (Reuters Report, 5th)</p>

<p>Plans Divided into Four Major Categories, to be Implemented Starting This Summer</p>
<p>Manchuria Road Construction Costs 150.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>July 1st, Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported: "Since the economic construction of 'Manchukuo' has been intensively studied by authorities in various fields, all major industries have been brought under a certain degree of control, and it has been decided to implement them all starting this summer. The specific plan is as follows: ㈠ Controlled Enterprises: All major industries will be transferred to joint operation by Japan and 'Manchukuo', that is, 'Manchukuo' will use existing goods as collateral for funds, and Japan will provide funds. There are seven important enterprises: 1. Manchuria Gasoline Company: Establish a gasoline company to purchase refined crude oil and heavy oil. 2. Manchuria Coal Mine Company: Merge the major coal mines in Manchuria into a joint Japanese-Manchurian enterprise. Fushun and Benxihu will not join for the time being, and will be merged later. Set up a head office in Changchun. 3. Japan-Manchuria Mineral Company: Mainly based on products from Manchuria, and jointly operated with companies in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Also, establish an industrial company to conduct large-scale industrial experiments. 4. Ammonium Sulfate Industry Company: The Manchuria Chemical Industry Company has already been established, and a testing ground is being prepared in Dalian. 5. Manchuria Electric Power Company: In order to control Manchurian electricity, a joint Japanese-Manchurian electric power company will be established with its head office in Changchun. 6. Manchuria Gold Mining Company: Establish a joint Japanese-Manchurian gold mining company to operate gold mining businesses in Heilongjiang, Xing'an Province, and Jilin Province. 7. Alcohol Company: Because the alcohol business in Harbin has always suffered from overproduction, a joint Japanese-Manchurian company will be established to control the industry. ㈡ Privately Operated Enterprises: There are eight enterprises that Japanese and Manchurians have already started to operate or are planning: 1. Cement Company: Except for the control of production volume, factory location, and sales area, private businesses are allowed to operate freely. 2. Jute Manufacturing Company: Planning a jute manufacturing business in northern Manchuria. 3. Public Bus Business: This business is allowed to be operated by private businesses, as long as it does not directly interfere with the railway. 4. Brewing Business: Preparing to establish a Japanese sake brewery in the Tiexi industrial zone of Fengtian. 5. Animal Husbandry Business: Preparing to operate a large-scale animal husbandry business. 6. Entrusted Operation of State-owned Placer Gold Mining Areas: Those with definite capital are allowed to operate. 7. Fiber Paper Manufacturing Business: This is the business with the greatest hope from the private sector. 8. Farms: Many are preparing to operate large farms, mostly Koreans, using Manchurian farmers. ㈢ Planned Enterprises: There are also four items currently being planned for controlled economy: 1. Forest Development Company: A joint Japanese-Manchurian enterprise for logging large forests in Jilin Province and transplanting trees, etc. 2. Horse and Sheep Business: Actively studying and implementing methods for the controlled planning of horse and sheep breeding. 3. Salt Manufacturing Business: Increase the salt fields in the Yingkou area, reduce the price of salt in Manchuria, and supply industrial salt to Japan. 4. Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Business: Planning to manufacture special drugs such as morphine and paralytic gokoku under control. ㈣ Immigration Business: 1. In the vicinity of Qihuli in the south of Jiamusi (i.e., the south of the first immigration area), another 500 self-defense immigrants will be sent in mid-July. 2. The area along the Jidun-Duntu line was originally an important transportation line for national security and defense, and a family self-defense immigration plan is being planned. 3. Other free immigrants: There are also various plans, and all are permitted as long as they comply with the general guidelines. On the other hand, a large-scale immigration subsidy agency is being established in Japan. Currently, an immigration association is being established to raise 2 million yuan in funds.</p>
<p>According to Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Manchuria's roads are the worst in the world. Since the establishment of the National Highway Bureau on March 3 this year, the total length of planned roads has reached 60,000 kilometers, with a cost of 150.5 million yuan. It is planned to be carried out in ten years, with two phases of construction. The first phase is five years for 34,000 kilometers, and it is planned to complete 4,000 kilometers this year and 3,300 kilometers next year. The goal of the national highway is to take Changchun as the center and connect major cities and important cities with each other and with county towns to facilitate national defense and industry. The regulations stipulate that first-class roads should be 7 meters wide, second-class roads should be 6 meters wide, and the following belong to third-class roads. First- and second-class roads are for motor vehicles, but in river areas, due to the uncertain changes in rivers, those who cannot build bridges should lay stones on the riverbed in shallow water, and use ferries in deep water. In the Xing'an Province and other large plains, road signs will be built. Construction has already started between Fengtian and Fushun, and between Changchun and Jilin. Labor is mainly recruited from local people, and in order to prevent the deterioration of vagrants and relieve unemployment, military engineers are building roads.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Deng Xihou Counterattacks Liu Wenhui <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Strives to Unify Various Armies</p>
<p>Troops of the Two Lius Have Not Yet Made Contact</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since Liu Xiang decided to use force to stop the Sichuan War, the atmosphere has suddenly become tense. At the same time, troops under Liu's command who were ordered to join the suppression of bandits in northern Sichuan have also been mobilized one after another. There is a phenomenon in the Sichuan army that is worth noting. The previously fragmented troops of various departments have gradually unified their orders. Although Yang Sen had previously established his own banner, he has recently returned to Liu's command. The troops of Tian Songyao and Deng Xihou also had independence in the past, but since Liu Wenhui and Deng Tian had a conflict last year, Deng Tian, unable to resist Wenhui alone, also attached themselves to Liu Xiang one after another. Tian's military pay is now completely collected in Chongqing, and he listens to Liu Xiang's dispatch. This time, Liu and Deng have another conflict, and Deng expresses more obedience to Liu Xiang. Deng's army number has now been completely reorganized in accordance with Chongqing. This is the manifestation of the fact. Therefore, the only one who is unwilling to attach to Yu is Liu Wenhui's</p>
<p>80,000 people, while the remaining 180,000 people are all under Liu Xiang's command. Therefore, the result of this re-battle between the two Lius may lead to the unification of military power in Sichuan. As for the troops of the two Lius, as of the time of sending the message, they have not yet made contact, because the rear deployments have not yet been finalized. Although Liu Wenhui had issued a telegram advocating joint suppression of the Red Army, this is just a kind of advertisement that usually precedes the start of a war. In fact, he has appointed six command routes and appointed Ding Xiangyuren as the commander of the rear guard. These are all wartime names, which shows that the war is on the verge of breaking out. Luo Zezhou, Li Qixiang, and other generals issued a Jiang telegram to Liu Wenhui today (3rd), stating that the Red Disaster and civil unrest are worrying, and asked Provincial Liu to repent and withdraw his troops back to defense, return the defense area and occupied agencies of Deng's troops, and allocate two divisions of troops to cooperate with the various armies to suppress the Red Army, under the unified command of Liu Xiang, and proceed as a whole, otherwise the various armies will cooperate to remove obstacles in order to suppress bandits. From this, it is also conceivable that the various troops of Luo and Li are ready to use force against Wenhui.</p>
<p>At this juncture, what is the situation of the Sichuan bandits is worth noting. According to the latest reports, Xu Xiangqian's bandit troops are still controlling the county borders of Tongnanba, and have not attacked, and are trying to concentrate property and coerce the people. Tian Songyao's troops are still guarding the south bank of the three rivers of Cangxi Guozhong Yilong and Guangyuan and have not counterattacked. In Suifu Hongkou, there are more than a thousand Red bandits attacking Huangzhongbao. This place is Liu Cunhou's defense line. After Liu ordered Liao Zhen's troops to suppress them with two regiments, the bandits had retreated on the 29th. Both soldiers and bandits suffered casualties in this battle. About 300 soldiers were killed or injured. The He bandits between Sichuan and Hubei are still distributed in Changtan River, Hongtuxi, and Qianzhan Dam. Xu Yuanquan is instructing Jiang and Zhang's troops to find the main force of the bandits in preparation for an attack. According to telegrams obtained by the military department here, Xu himself had returned to Yichang from Shinan today (3rd).</p>
<p>The anti-tax army in southern Sichuan is still strong. County Magistrate Chen of Qionglai County has been captured and killed by them. The people in Chengdu are restless and the security is worrying. Deng Xihou's residence in the province was robbed on the evening of the first of this month, and the son of Kou, the director of his military supplies office, was kidnapped. His whereabouts are unknown. The streets are closed to pedestrians at 8 pm. The troops stationed in the province, Shi Zhaowu and Zhu Zhizhao, have always been lax in discipline, and recently, due to the difficulty in paying salaries, they have even more outrageous actions, but no one dares to intervene. Deng Xihou himself has gone to Jintang to supervise the army, and began to counterattack Banzhuyuan, Zhaojiadu, and other places yesterday (2nd), and fierce battles have occurred. (July 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Qingdao Various Circles Organize a Society to Retain Shen Honglie <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Telegraph Beijing and Ping to Retain Him</p>
<p>Appointed Representatives to Visit Shen and Request Him Not to Resign</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Because Shen Honglie telegraphed Beijing to resign, various groups in Qingdao specially formed the "Qingdao Various Circles Joint Society to Retain Mayor Shen." The society held a general meeting at the Qingdao YMCA on Zhejiang Road at 2 pm today (3rd). Many representatives from various circles attended. Guo Jinnan served as chairman and reported the reasons for the meeting, saying that since Mayor Shen took office, he has done a lot for local construction, and the people have benefited from it. This time, he resigned due to the naval incident, and various groups have telegraphed the authorities, begging them to comfort and retain him. Although the central government has telegraphed to comfort and retain him, Mayor Shen has not yet dispelled his intention to resign. In order to concentrate our efforts, we have established this society. In the future, we hope that all circles will work together to achieve the goal of retaining Mayor Shen. After the report was finished, the method of retaining him was discussed: ㈠ Telegraph the authorities in Beijing and Ping to comfort and retain him. ㈡ Appoint representatives to visit Mayor Shen at 9 am tomorrow (4th) to plead with him to dispel his intention to resign. ㈢ Print and declare the intention to retain Mayor Shen to make it known to the public. This retention of Mayor Shen is purely driven by conscience and is by no means an ordinary social event. ㈣ Unite various groups and schools to go to the municipal government to retain him on a large scale. Finally, it was decided to send representatives to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers Association to ask them to join the society in order to strengthen its strength. Then, the meeting was adjourned. (July 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Antiques Discovered in Shou County <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Many Bells, Tripods, and Cauldrons Excavated from Ancient Tombs</p>
<p>According to Legend, They Are Artifacts of the Spring and Autumn Period</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Shou County in northern Anhui Province was Shouzhou in the Qing Dynasty. In ancient times, it was called Huainan. In the Spring and Autumn Period, it was the land of Wu, Chu, Chen, and Cai. In the Warring States Period, it was merged into Chu. There are many ancient sites in the area. Recently, a large number of antiques have been discovered. According to a person from the county, there is a tall ancient tomb near Zhujiaji in the east of the county. It is said to be the tomb of the King of Chu in the Spring and Autumn Period, but it is impossible to verify which king of Chu is buried in it. It is commonly known as the Lijia Dagu Dui. Zhu Hongchu, a gentleman from Zhuji, recently saw that precious antiques were often found in the excavation of ancient tombs everywhere, so he gathered more than 150 nearby farmers and went to excavate. At that time, many antiques were dug out, including more than a dozen pairs of ancient tripods, each weighing about 100 jin. There are seal characters on the tripods. Because they have been in the soil for a long time, the handwriting is blurred, but only the two characters "Chu Yu" can be identified. They are antique and are indeed artifacts of the Spring and Autumn Period. In addition, many bronze bells and bronze cauldrons were also excavated, totaling about 7,000 jin. There are also hundreds of ancient objects of gold, silver, jade, and emerald, which are of great value. However, Zhu Hongchu kept it strictly secret from the outside world. Except for the heavy bronze utensils that are not easy to collect and can be viewed by people, other precious items are strictly stored and not allowed to be appreciated by others. Recently, it was heard that eight pieces of scattered antiques were sold, earning more than 3,000 yuan. Before long, the administrative inspector of the fourth district of Anhui Province in Shou County learned of the matter. He believed that local antiques were related to culture and should be preserved in every possible way. He sent personnel to prohibit further excavation and detained the Bao of Zhuji to strictly investigate the excavated antiques. A part of them has now been found and transported back in an attempt to preserve the ancient culture. (July 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Commissioner Requests Repair of Baoshan Embankment <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Xu Weizhen, the administrative inspector of the sixth district, believed that the Baoshan County embankment was extremely important. He rushed to inspect it the other day. In various sections such as Zhangjiazhai, Xuejiatan, and Shidong Yanchi North Head, either the embankment foot was scoured by water and found gaps, or the embankment body was tilted outward and was about to collapse. The old embankment of Gujiadun also has a gap of about 280 feet long, which is extremely dangerous. In the event of an accident, the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Bao in the sixth district will bear the brunt. Now that the autumn flood season is approaching, it is difficult to delay any further. It is estimated that the project is about 1,380 meters long and requires about 120,000 yuan, which cannot be raised by local financial resources. He specifically returned to the office to request the provincial government to approve the rapid allocation of special funds so that they can be rushed to repair it to avoid danger.</p>

<p>An unidentified male corpse was found in the Changbang Bay River in Luowang Township, Xinzhuang at about 3 pm yesterday (6th). The corpse resembled a people from another province, about 40 years old, wearing a gabardine student uniform, white cloth shorts, and a black cloth gown. Yu Shilan, the police officer in charge of the township, reported to the 5th branch of the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it to the County Public Security Bureau, and sent a letter to the Procuratorate of the County Court to send personnel to inspect it.</p>

<p>Since the opening of long-distance buses by the Shangsong Bus Company, transportation between Songjiang and Shanghai has become more convenient. Tourists from Shanghai who own cars come to Songjiang on weekends and holidays, and cars come one after another. Previously, the company sent personnel to the Weiqiao Station to collect a toll of one yuan per car for road maintenance. The matter was heard by the Five Provinces Highway Office, which believed that the road belonged to the public and sent a letter to the provincial government to forward it to the company to stop collecting fees. The company has now complied with the order to stop collecting fees.</p>

<p>Shen Yuan, the former chief of the Lumou Township District and a lawyer, had an ancestral tomb in Kouzhuangji. A few days ago, Wu Zihan, a man from Jiangyin, led a cow to graze on Shen's grave. Tang Genbao and others in the township told him that he could not trample on the grave to graze. Wu did not listen, which led to a fight with Tang Genbao and others. However, Wu was so powerful that Tang and others could not resist, so they gathered dozens of people from the township, each armed with weapons, and beat Wu. Wu could not resist alone, and was hit in the key point and seriously injured and fell to the ground. People carried Wu to the Gospel Hospital for treatment, but he died. The District Procuratorate sent personnel to verify it and detained Tang Genfu and his son, the ringleaders, and sent them to the court to await trial.</p>

<p>There are 1,550 looms and more than 700 weaving workers in the weaving room of the Shenxin No. 3 Yarn Factory in Taibaodun, outside the west gate of this county. They work 15 hours a day from 4 am to 8 pm, and can produce more than 2,000 bolts of cloth. After the January 28th Incident last year, the boycott of Japanese goods made domestic yarn and cloth strong, so the business was very prosperous. Recently, due to the coldness of resisting goods and the sluggish sales of domestic yarn and cloth, the factory implemented a reduction of two cents in wages per bolt. The female workers expressed dissatisfaction, so they asked Chen Arong, the executive director of the union, to negotiate with the factory, and agreed to reply at 10 am yesterday. However, there was no concrete solution until 11 am. More than 700 female workers suddenly went on strike. Later, Xue Mingjian, the general manager of the factory, went to the union to mediate. As a result, the wages were reduced by eight li per bolt. The female workers were satisfied and resumed work this morning (6th).</p>

<p>The spring cocoons in our county this year have been excellent due to suitable weather and good seed quality, so the harvest is extremely good. In addition, the price of silk has gradually increased. The silk farmers are happy, and the silk merchants are also looking forward to the reversal of fortunes. According to a gentleman from the silk factory industry, the price of Japanese silk has recently risen, opening at 1,000 yen. Compared with the Japanese silk five days ago, it has risen by 30 yen, and the stomach of the United States and France is very smooth. The summer silkworms of this year have now opened their leaves for the third sleep, and the number of breeding households is greater than last year. The silkworms are developing healthily. Although there will be no formal summer cocoon market for weighing and buying, there are still general cocoon makers who search for them. Recently, the shops selling autumn silkworm seeds along the road are no less than in spring. The interest of general breeding households is very strong, and there is a situation where they are too busy to respond to those who go to book in advance and buy in person. It is really a good phenomenon for the future of the silk industry.</p>

<p>The rice industry in Xiyi has always been sold on behalf of customers. The usual practice is one cent discount per yuan, called Jiu Jiu Dui, which is common in Jing and Shanghai. Recently, due to the decline in grain prices, the discount income has been sharply reduced, which has greatly affected the expenses of various industries. After discussion by the industry, it was decided to change the old rules. The Jiu Jiu Dui will be changed to Jiu Ba Si from July 1. After the decision, a notice will be issued to the various industries, but the rice shops in various sections are deeply concerned that the increase in discounts will affect customers, so they have not been able to agree.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau here owes a lot of military pay. After a previous request, it began to issue military pay for April and May, but the salaries for February and March have not been paid up to now. Now, in addition to June, the accumulated arrears are as many as three months. It is really difficult for the police officers to maintain. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, a police affairs meeting was held. The heads of each branch bureau and the patrol officers of each branch station took this opportunity to first solve the problem of arrears of military pay. After discussion, it was unanimously decided to forward it to the county government for appeal. Gu Faxiang, the head of the first branch bureau, took the lead, and the heads and patrol officers of each branch bureau also co-signed. This petition was sent by the heads of each branch bureau to the Chief of the General Bureau, Yin Pengyu, and then submitted to the county government through the police affairs meeting, requesting that the arrears of military pay for February and March be paid first.</p>

<p>Recently, the bandits on the coast of northern Jiangsu have become rampant again. The bandit leader, nicknamed Bent Tail, has gathered 200 to 300 people to act illegally. The Provincial Security Office has ordered the county magistrates of the coastal counties to send the county to join the provincial land and water police regiment to strictly defend and suppress them.

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the county has been dry and rainless, which has caused grasshoppers to occur in various districts. Although the county government has repeatedly ordered the grasshopper directors of each township to exterminate them, they are difficult to exterminate due to their large number. Now the grasshoppers in each district have grown wings and are flying in the sky, and the clouds and sun are obscured. A large number of flying locusts also passed through the city last night (3rd) from east to west. A large number of flying locusts landed on the ground around the police city blocking army building outside the north city. The autumn harvest this year seems to be worrisome.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Wang Mingfu, Member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Returns to China to Collect Goods <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Love the Country and Promote the Sale of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Wang Mingfu, the executive committee member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, has lived in Siam for more than 20 years. He is well respected by the local overseas Chinese and the Siamese government for his business operations. He has spared no effort in promoting domestic goods overseas. Recently, in view of the increasing number of domestic products, many of them have not yet reached Siam and are unknown, he specially returned to China from Siam to contact domestic product merchants and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in this city in order to widely introduce them. The reporter of the New Voice Society met Wang at his hotel yesterday and talked about the following points:</p>
<h3 id="e70">Recent Situation of Overseas Chinese in Siam <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>According to Wang, there are as many as 2 million overseas Chinese in Siam, most of whom are from Guangdong Province, followed by Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces. Most of them are engaged in business in Siam. Almost all the shops in Siam are set up by our Chinese. Those who work include sawmills and rice mills. A considerable number of them are also engaged in agriculture, cultivating fields and planting crops. Therefore, in terms of financial status, our overseas Chinese contribute to the prosperity of the market and occupy an extremely important position. Although the Siamese government occasionally has various restrictions on overseas Chinese, there is still no sign of disharmony. Because our country has no commercial officers and consuls there, all important events are presided over by the General Chamber of Commerce. The solidarity of the overseas Chinese in Siam is still good, but unfortunately they all focus on the combination of fellow villagers and clans, and have not yet fully achieved the goal of overall unity.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Siamese-Chinese Trade Situation <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>In Siamese-Chinese trade, Siam's trade with China is limited to rice and wood, because the country's major products are only these two items. Therefore, only these two items are transported to our country. Most of the rice imported into our country is in the southwestern provinces, while wood is more common. According to statistics, the total amount reaches about 20 million yuan each year. Because of its tropical location, the major items that our country transports to Siam for sale are clothing materials such as silk and summer cloth. Secondly, because our overseas Chinese account for more than two-thirds of the population there, all kinds of miscellaneous items are in very considerable amounts each year due to the patriotic spirit. Now, since the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce has established a domestic product exhibition hall in Siam to widely introduce them, overseas compatriots are happy to use domestic goods, so domestic goods have a very large sales market in Siam. Among the businesses of other countries in Siam, the United Kingdom and Denmark are the most prominent, but they are mostly engaged in machinery businesses. However, in recent years, Japanese goods have gradually filled the market. Coupled with the impact of the world economic depression, the business situation of our overseas Chinese has also been affected.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Education of Overseas Chinese Children <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>As for the education of overseas Chinese children,</p>
<p>There are about 100 elementary schools established by themselves, which are still common. There is only one junior high school, Xinmin. Now we plan to set up a high school, with a budget of more than 20,000 yuan, but the amount is relatively large, and the preparation is a little difficult, so it is still in the planning stage. However, since April of this year, the Siamese government has ordered each school to teach Siamese history and geography for more than 20 hours a week. After negotiations with the Siamese government by the Chamber of Commerce, the government agreed to reduce the time, but it has not been completely resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Return to China to Collect Goods <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>I came to Shanghai this time because the Chinese Chamber of Commerce is building a large auditorium, completely modeled after our country's modern architectural style, and it is expected to be completed around Double Ten Festival. Inside the auditorium, domestic products are displayed all around for wide introduction, so I was specially commissioned to come to Shanghai to solicit samples from various manufacturers. Now, after contacting the product exhibition hall in this city, there have been considerable results. I will stay in Shanghai for about two weeks. Once the collection of domestic product samples is completed, I will return to Siam to arrange them, and so on.</p>

<p>General Li Du, after retreating from the Northeast to Europe, has taken the Italian mail steamer "Conte Verde" from Italy to Shanghai. His secretary, Liu Xuchen, and others who are traveling with him, have already arrived in Hong Kong. General Wang Delin, after arriving in Hong Kong, went to Guangzhou at the invitation of the Southwest. Now, he is also coming to Shanghai on the same ship as Li Du. Yesterday, the Italian mail company received a telegram stating that the "Conte Verde" had left Hong Kong yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon tomorrow. The ship will dock at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong, and passengers will disembark. A small steamer will be sent by the Italian company to meet them and take them ashore at the Customs Wharf.</p>

<p>Will Go to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang and Offer Advice</p>
<p>Wang Yitang, who has been living in seclusion in Tianjin for some time and has not been involved in current affairs, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10 a.m. with several attendants on the Ewo Company's "Lisheng" steamer. After landing, he went directly to Duan Qirui's residence on Avenue Joffre to discuss the situation in North China. He had lunch at Duan's residence and left around 2 p.m. It is reported that Wang's trip south was at the invitation of Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to inquire about the situation in North China and discuss various peaceful solutions. Wang will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang and offer his advice.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Zhang Qun Unwilling to Preside Over Hubei <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Central Government Seeks Opinion</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Still Declining</p>
<p>Hubei Provincial Government Chairman Xia Douyin has repeatedly petitioned the central government to resign. The central government, seeing Xia's firm intention to resign, has decided to approve his request. As for the successor, the central government has already internally decided on the former Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun. Zhang is currently still declining the position. However, the central government believes that Hubei is an important area in terms of military and political affairs. Zhang has had considerable political achievements as the former mayor of Shanghai and has also served as the director of the Political Affairs Department of the General Headquarters, making him particularly familiar with military affairs. Therefore, Zhang is the preferred candidate for the chairmanship of Hubei Province, and efforts are being made to persuade him.</p>
<p>It is hoped that he will change his mind and take office in Hubei. A Central News Agency reporter visited Zhang at his residence yesterday morning to inquire about the issue of presiding over Hubei. According to Zhang, Chairman Xia has resigned repeatedly since last year, and the central government has resolutely retained him each time. This time, Chairman Xia resigned again due to physical discomfort, and the central government, seeing Xia's firm intention to resign, decided to approve his request. The central government did seek his consent to succeed Chairman Xia as the chairman of Hubei Province. Since resigning from the position of Shanghai mayor, he has been traveling between the north and south and has not taken any permanent position. He deeply desires to serve the country in a leisurely manner and does not wish to hold this permanent position. Therefore, he has declined the offer, hoping that the central government can understand and allow him to continue to travel between the north and south in a leisurely manner to serve the country.</p>
<h3 id="e77">South China Typhoon Causes Heavy Losses to Ships <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Cargo Washed Away by Huge Waves</p>
<p>In the past three days, a typhoon occurred in the South China Sea, causing varying degrees of damage to commercial ships sailing in the area. Yesterday, this city received telegrams from Shantou and Xiamen reporting that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Tonghua" steamer, which was on its way from Shanghai to Xiamen, encountered the typhoon when it was about to reach the waters outside Xiamen port. The strength of the typhoon, the height of the raging waves, and the intensity of the wind and waves were rare. Fortunately, the "Tonghua" took precautions in advance and anchored to avoid the wind. Twenty large barrels of raw oil stored on the upper deck of the ship were washed away by a huge wave. The wave crashed through the ship, and the twenty barrels of oil were completely washed into the sea and sank to the bottom. In addition, more than a hundred pieces of deck cargo were also partially washed into the sea, and the other part was soaked by the waves, resulting in enormous losses. Fortunately, the ship was able to maintain its position with the help of huge anchors; otherwise, it would have been in danger. The "Yuanda" steamer in the waters off Xiamen also suffered the same danger. More than sixty pieces of deck cargo were soaked and heavily damaged by the typhoon and huge waves. Currently, the Hakka people in Xiamen require the shipowner to be responsible for the cargo washed away by the sea waves. They must report to the customs and obtain proof of the cargo being lost at sea before they can claim compensation from the insurance company. Several other commercial ships have suffered similar damage.</p>
<p>It is reported that several fishing boats at sea have been sunk by the typhoon, and an investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Shanghai Power Company Statement <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Company Serves the Public</p>
<p>Workers Serve the Company</p>
<p>Those Who Obstruct Must Be Dismissed</p>
<p>A labor dispute has occurred at the Shanghai Power Company, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the company issued a statement saying that the cause of the dispute was that a worker claimed to have been dismissed without receiving compensation. After a thorough investigation by the company's Chinese and foreign staff, it was found that the worker had resigned voluntarily after being reprimanded for a work error. Senior staff members tried to persuade him to return to work, but he insisted on resigning. According to the company's regulations, dismissed employees, except those who were dismissed for misconduct, are given compensation based on the length of their service. However, those who resign voluntarily are not given compensation unless they have served for more than twenty years. The worker in question had only worked for the company for three and a half years and was not entitled to compensation according to the regulations. Therefore, he lied to his colleagues that he had been dismissed in order to obtain the compensation. Other employees believed this lie and, without consulting the company, held a meeting in the factory yard during working hours, causing disturbances. This type of action is sufficient to hinder the company's service to the public. The company, in view of the importance of serving the public, issued a notice to its employees in accordance with the principles of managing public utilities, stating: "1. This company is responsible for continuously supplying electricity and cannot allow interruptions in electricity supply unless factories are shut down, causing thousands of workers to lose their jobs. This Monday afternoon, some workers suddenly refused to work without prior notice and caused disturbances without consulting the company, thus hindering the company's service. This company has repeatedly stated that it is willing to discuss any reasonable issues with its colleagues. However, without first consulting the company or considering the company's responsibility to the public, they rashly caused disturbances. This company cannot tolerate employees stopping their service to the public for selfish purposes through strikes or other means. No one is allowed to stop working, gather for meetings, or cause disturbances during working hours that obstruct the company's service. In order to protect the company's service to the public, anyone who causes disturbances, stops working, gathers for meetings, or uses other methods to obstruct the company's business during working hours will be dismissed. This company always has extra staff ready to ensure the company's service to the public and the uninterrupted supply of electricity. All loyal colleagues who are willing to work as usual will be given thorough protection." Unfortunately, some employees, without first consulting the company or considering their responsibility to the public, have already caused disturbances in an attempt to obstruct the company's service to the public. The company is therefore taking the position that it will not allow any interruption in electricity supply, given the importance of this service. The company usually provides its workers with special treatment because it recognizes that public utilities have a responsibility to provide continuous service. However, in the event of a strike, those who disregard their responsibility to the public and obstruct the service of public utilities have already automatically terminated their right to serve the public. Therefore, the company cannot negotiate with them.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Singapore's New Import Goods Falsification Penalties <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Consul in Penang Asks Chinese Exporters to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Exporters in this city, for the sake of small profits, often combine various small items into large items when transporting goods to Penang and Singapore, and use vacuum tubes as empty bottles. The packaging does not indicate that the Straits Transport Alliance, after discovering this malpractice, appointed an inspection committee stationed in Singapore, authorized to inspect. Once discovered, the penalties are doubled. The Consulate in Penang reported the above situation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry, which forwarded it to the International Trade Bureau of this city for verification and handling. After receiving the order, the Bureau has separately sent letters to the City Chamber of Commerce and exporters, reminding them to pay attention. The instructions of the Ministry of Industry and the report of the Consulate in Penang are extracted and recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Industry Instructions <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau received the Ministry of Industry's Commerce Character No. 18520 instructions yesterday, stating: "For compliance purposes, enclosed is a report from the Consulate in Penang dated May 1st of the 22nd year, regarding the filling in of packaging by exporters, which can be used as a reference. A copy of the original text is enclosed for your inspection." After review by the Ministry, it is deemed that the matter concerns the interests of exporters. A copy of the original text is enclosed, ordering the Bureau to immediately comply, and to inform exporters in various places that they must not falsify the filling in of packaging in the future, so as to avoid being discovered, penalized, and suffering losses. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Consulate Report <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Consulate in Penang reported on May 1st regarding the filling in of packaging that exporters should pay attention to, stating: "Merchants in various places often falsify things when transporting goods to Singapore and other ports in the Far East in order to save freight. The words written on the packaging of the goods are written incorrectly, so that they are different from the contents. In order to rectify freight revenue, the Straits Transport Alliance appointed a goods inspection committee, stationed in Singapore, authorized to the inspector to check the contents of the goods shipped to the port from other places in front of the receiving personnel at any time to see if the contents of the goods are consistent with what is stated on the outside of the packaging. It is said that many goods shipped to Singapore, small items are combined with large items, and only the name of the large item is written on the packaging. Sometimes a batch of vacuum tubes is marked as empty bottles, their value is very different, and the freight can be reduced. It is found that this is an act of collusion between the exporter and the consignee, not a careless mistake on the packaging at one time. This kind of falsification has been around for a long time, but the Straits Transport Alliance only recently discovered it. In order to rectify revenue, there is now a method of appointing an inspector."</p>
<h3 id="e88">Additional Penalties <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>And additional penalties are added, in order to warn those who profit from this. The inspection method started with the Dutch East Indies Transportation Authority in the Dutch East Indies, which first formulated the same inspection method. The Straits Settlements, China, Japan and other places have followed their method to formulate regulations and formally implement them. When each cargo is found by the inspector to be inconsistent with what is marked, and the freight of what is marked is lower than the freight of the cargo, then the freight should be fined one time, and the importer is ordered to pay the real freight, the difference between the original marked freight and the difference, and the fine, before the goods can be picked up. According to the investigation, the Transportation Alliance will decide</p>
<p>The method was sent to Singapore, and the board of directors of the Western Chamber of Commerce also held a meeting to discuss it, and believed that the matter was feasible, and decided to forward this method to all for their information. It is said that the general honest importers welcomed this inspection step, but there are also those who, although they have never falsified, have skeptical opinions about this method, because they believe that the goods shipped to Singapore will be opened, and they are very reluctant, and when they are not opened, they will try to find a way to avoid being inspected, but they will not succeed. After being angry, they immediately raised an objection, and then the Transportation Alliance authorities and the inspectors explained the various situations in detail, and then cancelled the objection, and believed that this method was indeed beneficial to careful importers. As this method has been implemented, there will be more complicated procedures for imported goods, but the Straits Transport Alliance has decided to implement it, and the Western Chamber of Commerce has also expressed its approval, and it is imperative. In the future, exporters in our country should pay extreme attention to the packaging of goods and the reporting of their contents, so as to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Shanghai Telephone Company Statement Regarding Five-Cent Call Fee <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a statement yesterday, saying that recent news reports about the cancellation of the five-cent Chinese-foreign call fee are one-sided. The company believes that the contract signed on April 19th stipulates that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Telephone Company charge five cents per call from the user making the call. This fee was originally set seven years ago, and although telephone fees have been increased by both parties, this fee has remained unchanged. Now the Telephone Bureau wants to cancel this fee, so that its fewer users can also benefit from the larger telephone network of the Telephone Company. On the contrary, the Telephone Company has no equal benefits. The result will be that all users in the Public Concession and the French Concession will bear the cost of calls, otherwise, according to the current method, only the person making the call will bear the cost.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Zhabei Silk Factory Strike Affects Entire District <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Zhengfeng and Others Resume Work Then Stop Again</p>
<p>Commotion Occurs During Persuasion</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate Tomorrow</p>
<p>Police Suppress With Batons This Morning After Work Resumes</p>
<p>The Zhabei Zhengfeng and other silk factory workers went on strike in unison on the afternoon of the day before yesterday because they demanded the restoration of wages and the factory did not give a concrete reply. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the Party and police agencies summoned representatives from the factory and workers to persuade them, the situation between the two sides has eased, and it was decided to resume work as usual starting yesterday morning. However, the Chuxin and other silk factories on Changan Road also went on strike yesterday morning, thus expanding the scope. Also, because the situation of the workers is complicated, there were even incidents of troublemaking taking advantage of the opportunity. Fortunately, the police stations in each district maintained order, so accidents were avoided. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled to summon representatives from both the factory and the workers tomorrow (the 8th) for mediation. The situation yesterday is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting and Resuming Work After Zhengfeng, Yichang, Yifengsheng, Yuncheng, Changfeng, Zhengda, Xiangcheng, Yongting, and other silk factory workers went on strike in unison the day before yesterday (the 5th), they still gathered together and did not disperse until around 5:50 p.m., when</p>
<p>The police brigade persuaded them to return home in batches, and then they dispersed. The Zhabei Fourth District Party Headquarters, the Silk Industry Union, and the Fifth District Third Branch Office immediately convened representatives from the above-mentioned factories at the Hujia Muqiao Fire Station to discuss solutions. Those present included Shen Sheng from the Fourth District Party Headquarters, Chen Xiuchang from the Labor Union, Wen Yishan, Chief of the Third Branch Office of the Fifth District, Wang Zixuan from Yichang, Wang Shenqingyi from the Branch Factory, Wei Kunjiang from Fengsheng, Yu Jingfang from Zhengfeng, Zhou Shuyin from Yuncheng, Yu Wengui from Changfeng, Cha Jianshi from Zhengda, Zhang Peikun from Xiangcheng, and Yuan Bingzhang from Yongting. At first, the representatives of each factory insisted on implementing the announcement of the stoppage of the machinery. After the Party and police persuaded them, they immediately agreed on three solutions: 1. Each factory will continue to resume work on the morning of the 6th. It does not matter how many workers come to work, or the time of arrival, whether early or late. The economy is also not considered. 2. The workers will be guided by union officials to return to work in all directions on the same evening (the 5th). There must be no more strikes or disturbances. The issue of salary increases will be resolved after waiting for the Party and government agencies. 3. Each factory will be protected by the police dispatched by each branch office to maintain order.</p>
<p>Stopped Again in the Afternoon After the meeting, union officials went to various factories to persuade the workers to resume work. Therefore, the factories resumed operation normally yesterday morning (the 6th). In the morning, Yichang and its two branch factories all arrived at the factory, but the time of arrival varied. Yifengsheng only had one-tenth of its workers, Zhengfeng had seven-tenths, Yuncheng had one-tenth, Changfeng had six-tenths, Zhengda had all, Xiangcheng had one-tenth, Yongting had eight-tenths, and Fulunheng did not participate in the strike, so there was no problem. By the afternoon, the workers learned that 27 other silk factories in Zhabei had gone on strike, and there would be unfavorable news for the factories that had already resumed work. Therefore, they all waited and watched. So, except for Yichang, they all stopped work again starting in the afternoon. At the same time, at around 5:50 p.m., when the Party and Yichang and its two branch factories were about to close, dozens of hooligans suddenly appeared, holding dirty things, and lingered near there, intending to demonstrate to the workers of the factory. Fortunately, the nearby police officers noticed this and immediately reported it to the police station. A large number of police officers were dispatched to suppress them, so they were able to prevent other changes from happening. However, the workers were therefore afraid, so the problem of a full resumption of work today (the 7th) is still difficult to predict. Among them, Yuncheng and Zhengfeng factories announced that they would stop work for one day today (the 7th) to repair the machinery and furnaces, which were damaged, and have reported to the Party and government agencies for the record. The workers of Xiangcheng and Yifengsheng factories are said to be able to resume work without any problems if other factories formally resume work.</p>
<p>Affected the Entire District There are 31 silk factories that have started work in Zhabei District 1. Since Zhengfeng and other factories went on strike, 800 male and female workers from the Fuchang silk factory on Hutai Road suddenly went on strike together at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. After the Sixth District Silk Workers' Union sent people to persuade them, they all resumed work at 10:00 a.m. In the afternoon at 1:00 p.m., the female workers of Fengtaishun in Dayang Bridge and Yutai in Tanziwan also went on strike together, and the order was chaotic. They gathered together to demand that the silk factories take unified action. As a result, 27 factories in Zhabei District Changan Road Maofeng, Qianyuan, Xiexin, Hongsheng, Chuxin, Jiyu Xieji, Zhenxing, Baotaishun, Yuanxin, Gonghe Road Jiyu Taiji, Dayang Bridge Fengtaishun, Tanziwan Yutai, Hutai Road Fuchang, Zhongxing Road Gongda, Tanjiaqiao Maoli, Dasheng Bridge Tiansheng, Gujiawan Xinglun, Guangfu Road Jiatai, Hongchun, Nanmeiyuan Road Wuxing, Hengfeng Road Meifeng, Yuanfeng, Fuyuan, Shentai, Yutong Road Yuanxing, Yuanji, Gujiawan Yufeng, and other 27 workers also went on strike one after another.</p>
<p>Commotion Occurred When the workers of Qianyuan and other factories went on strike, Yang Gengti, Yuan Yunlong, Wu Suzhen, and other members of the Sixth District Silk Workers' Union, led all the cadres to set off in different directions to persuade the workers. The police chief of the Fourth District General Department of the Public Security Bureau also set off to maintain order and persuade the workers. Female workers from the Chuxin Silk Factory on Changan Road refused to listen to persuasion, resulting in a conflict with the police officers. One patrolman from the Fourth District was injured by a thrown stone. Two female workers who caused the incident were arrested, and after being reprimanded by the district chief, they were released immediately because they were ignorant.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Resume Work Today <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the workers of various silk factories were persuaded by the Party, government, and police agencies, they expressed their acceptance. Because of various problems yesterday, they did not all work as usual. After consultation between the union and the Silk Industry Association, fearing that the workers might be incited by one or two hooligans and cause trouble everywhere, they decided to formally prepare a letter, earnestly requesting each police station to dispatch a large number of police officers to protect the workers going to work at the gates of each silk factory this morning. After receiving the letter, each district dispatched police officers overnight in batches, together with the police brigade, to maintain order.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Reasons for the Strike <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The wages of the female factory workers were originally six corners, with four days of monthly reward and three corners of weekly reward. The wages of the male workers were calculated on a monthly basis with four days of monthly reward. Each silkworm moth was paid one dollar and four and a half corners per month. Because the price of silk fell, the wages were reduced to 70%. A strike occurred, and later it was changed to 75%. Until this year, the price of silk rose, but the employer replied that the wages of the male workers would be calculated on a monthly basis, and the monthly salary would be increased according to the performance of the silkworm moth subsidy, one dollar and two corners per person per month. Workers who worked for one month were rewarded with two days of work. The wages of the female workers were calculated on a daily basis, four corners and eight cents per person per month, and those who worked for one week were rewarded with two corners, and those who worked for one month were rewarded with two days of work. According to the Fourth District Silk Industry Union, the sudden strike of the workers in various factories was caused by the disagreement between Yongheng and Zhengfeng factories. Yongting workers went to the front of Zhengfeng factory at noon when they were off work to instigate, saying that Yongheng had already gone on strike, so that a small number of Zhengfeng workers launched it first and then affected all of them. Later, the workers of Zhengfeng saw that the workers of Yongheng were still working, so they accused them of spreading rumors and instigating, so that they also went on strike and affected various factories. Therefore, this incident was actually a labor-capital problem caused by the jealousy of the employer.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Mediation Tomorrow <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>After the Social Affairs Bureau received the joint application for mediation from the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts Silk Industry Union on the 3rd of this month, fearing that strikes and other things would happen, it sent Zhang Chuqiang to investigate on the 4th. After the workers in each district went on strike for several days, it also sent people to investigate thoroughly and scheduled to summon the Silk Factory Industry Association and the Silk Industry Unions of the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow to conduct mediation. A notice was issued yesterday, stating: "For notification purposes, the case is that silk factory workers are demanding the restoration of their original treatment. This bureau has scheduled to summon you at 10:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month to conduct an interview. We hereby urgently notify the association to send two responsible representatives each to attend the bureau on time and listen to the interview. This is to notify, Director Wu Xingya."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications sent a letter to the public telephone attendants, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the Bureau established public telephones originally for the convenience of the public. The management fees for attendants are deducted monthly from the call fees, with a minimum allowance of two yuan, a very generous arrangement.  Attendants should be conscientious and dedicated to their duties.

In addition to dispatching undercover investigators, we hereby inform you that you must strictly adhere to the prescribed call fees and collect them accurately. Any private charges or additional fees will result in immediate disconnection and heavy fines. Please do not make a mistake."</p>

<p>Paying Attention to Hygiene and Prevention Along the Line</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Epidemic Prevention Bureau, believes that with the arrival of summer, epidemics are gradually emerging in various regions. If preventive measures are not taken in advance, outbreaks are inevitable.

<h3 id="e98">China National Industries Federation Publishes Yan Qingxiang's Account of Meeting with the Italian Prime Minister <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that Yan Qingxiang, the employer representative attending the International Labour Conference, sent a letter from Rome to the China National Industries Federation, detailing his visit with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. "I was ordered to attend the International Labour Conference, embarking on the 10th of April and setting sail the next day. I arrived in Venice, Italy, on May 5th and went to Rome the following day. Our ambassador to Italy was originally to be Kong Xiangxi, but since Kong had not yet taken office, the eldest son of the former ambassador to Japan, Wang Rongbao, was acting as chargé d'affaires.  After briefly resting, I went to the embassy to meet with Wang and Consul Zhu. After a brief exchange, Consul Zhu accompanied me to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Labour and Capital, the Central Party Headquarters, and the General Labour Union for courtesy visits, where I was received with sincerity. Wang, as chargé d'affaires, negotiated with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for my audience with Prime Minister Mussolini, scheduled for 6:00 PM on May 12th at the Prime Minister's office in the State Council. Wang accompanied me from my residence to the State Council. Upon arriving at the State Council, an adjutant led me to the waiting room. Because the Prime Minister was already receiving a guest, I waited for about half an hour. The adjutant then announced the Prime Minister's order to invite the guest in.  Wang and I arrived at the Prime Minister's office, and the guards opened the door. As soon as I stepped inside, I found the room unusually dark, with only a single electric light in the corner, its light dim and indistinct. The room was very large, about seventy feet wide and one hundred forty feet deep. In the center of the room were two large writing desks, three large chairs, and nothing else. After walking a few steps, my eyes suddenly flashed with light, as if a famous actor had taken the stage, with the curtains drawn open. Despite the size of the room, the simple furnishings gave it an empty, unadorned feel. The sudden flash of light was startling, and few people would not be surprised and lose their composure. I am normally insensitive, but I felt undisturbed and calm, even more so than usual, and continued to move forward with purpose. Mussolini had already risen from his seat to greet me.  He was wearing an army uniform, tall and imposing, but his appearance was very gentle. After Wang introduced me, we shook hands. Mussolini first said that he was very sorry for keeping me waiting because of the previous guest. He then asked us to sit down, and he leaned on the writing desk with both hands and talked to us. After paying my respects, I began to discuss administrative and party affairs, organizational structures, and industrial conditions, which he explained in great detail. Before leaving, he presented me with two signed photographs, with the words 'Sincere Respect' inscribed on them. Wang told me that Mussolini rarely did this and that his treatment of me was exceptional. I thanked him and stood up to say goodbye. Mussolini firmly shook my hand, patted my back, and escorted me to the door, saying, 'I apologize for not being able to entertain you more during your stay in our capital.' I bowed and thanked him again, and we shook hands before parting. As we left, Wang told me that Mussolini usually did not smile and that his demeanor was often stern when meeting with guests. His change in demeanor today, showing such kindness to you, is a testament to the respect foreign politicians have for industrialists. Even high-ranking political and military officials from our country have not been able to win his favor, making one feel inferior."  Since meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini, I have had many observations during my stay here. In summary, I would say that "the intelligence of the Italian people is not as great as that of the Chinese, but their faith is stronger." Thus, a man of his generation, such as Mussolini, has been able to take advantage of the times, reform politics, encourage agriculture and industry, and turn Italy into a first-class power in ten years. He is now taking further steps to organize large-scale industrial alliances, such as the rayon manufacturers, who are forming a joint company to reduce domestic competition and concentrate their efforts externally. This is just one example. Looking back at our country's industries, which lack communication and unity, resembling a heap of loose sand, and where jealousy among peers is deeply ingrained and difficult to break, how can we hope for a day of revitalization? I sincerely hope that domestic industrialists can quickly begin to cooperate and organize themselves to avoid being eliminated and defeated one by one in the future. Regarding the fact that the Italian party does not interfere in politics and the regulations that prevent it from doing so, I admire Mussolini's great courage and means. The city party headquarters' budget and final accounts must be submitted to the mayor for approval before being forwarded to the provincial party headquarters and then to the central party headquarters. All people's organizations, those belonging to the city are controlled by the mayor, those belonging to the province are controlled by the provincial governor, and those belonging to the whole country are controlled by the Minister of Labour and Capital. Mussolini started from the party but is not bound by it. This kind of courage and means is unique to Mussolini in the world. Therefore, I have repeatedly thought about how to make our country like Italy today. But it depends on people. If the important figures who now hold the central power can make good use of their opportunities to guide and protect the people, putting the people first in everything and strengthening the people's faith, and if the people can also understand the government's difficulties in doing things and not make unwarranted demands, realizing spiritual unity, then perhaps China's new life will begin at this moment. Otherwise, with foreign troubles unresolved and internal strife arising again, and people's livelihoods deteriorating, great disasters are coming. The root of national subjugation lies in poverty and weakness. Therefore, if we want to turn poverty into wealth and weakness into strength today, it is essential to completely reorganize the entire industry and commerce of the country, and especially to have a complete united organization. Are there any of my intelligent compatriots and the current industrial leaders who believe in my words and sympathize with me? Then this article is not in vain."</p>

<h3 id="e101">Jewish Merchants in Shanghai Implement Economic Boycott Against Germany <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>German Merchants Suffer Losses of Over One Million</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Seek to Take Advantage of the Opportunity</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that since the National Socialist Party, led by Hitler, came to power in Germany, an extreme anti-Jewish movement has prevailed. This has aroused resentment among Jewish financiers around the world, who wield tremendous financial power, towards the German dictatorial regime. Jews in Britain and France have launched boycotts of German goods as economic resistance and retaliation. The New Sound News Agency reporter investigated this deteriorating situation towards Germany yesterday, which has recently spread to Shanghai. According to foreign sources, Jews residing in Shanghai have long harboured resentment towards German expatriates and have been brewing a boycott movement against Germany for three months. Not only are they generally rejecting German goods, but they have also successively broken trade contracts with major commercial institutions such as German shipping and insurance companies. It is estimated that the German side has suffered losses of over one million yuan. The anti-German attitude of Jewish capitalists in Shanghai, such as Sassoon and Kadoorie, has attracted much attention. It is also reported that after the Jews launched the anti-German goods movement, they immediately engaged in secret negotiations with the commercial authorities of the British, French, Italian, and Japanese consulates, seeking to establish trade relations with those countries to eliminate relations with Germany. The Japanese commercial authorities and business community in Shanghai are actively negotiating with the Jews with certain conditions in order to expand Japanese economic power in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Land Value Tax Collection Cannot be Implemented This Year <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that regarding the collection of land value tax in the Shanghai city area, the reporter interviewed Jin Liren, Director of the Land Bureau, yesterday. According to him, the collection of land value tax will not be implemented this year due to complicated procedures. It is not true that the collection will begin in July. The Legislative Yuan has not yet approved the "Shanghai City Land Value Tax Collection Measures." Although it was submitted to the central government for approval, no reply has been received yet. Even if the Executive Yuan promulgates the revised regulations for collecting land value tax, it is still necessary to carry out investigation and valuation procedures. Therefore, the date of collection cannot be determined. Land in this city has only been subject to land tax, paying only one yuan and five cents per mu, which is unfair. This city is a major commercial port, and land prices are not uniform. The price of each mu may be worth hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands. Now, land value tax is collected as a percentage. The Valuation Committee will assess the land prices in various places and then determine the tax amount according to the regulations. If a landowner believes it is inappropriate, they can request a change at any time, but the final decision rests with the government. This method is based on the Premier's land policy. Since this city's situation is different from other provinces and cities, handling land value tax can enrich the city treasury to develop municipal facilities. If it can be handled smoothly, it will truly realize the Premier's aim of equalizing land rights.</p>

<p>Scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 10th of this Month</p>
<p>The Joint Association of the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industries has heard that the tax authorities will send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to mediate the local tobacco and alcohol tax. Regarding the tax matter, if there are difficulties, it can be discussed at length. On the 2nd of this month, a circular was sent to all executive and supervisory committee members of the two industries, advancing the date of the first joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the two industries by one month. The association's letter to the committee members is excerpted below: "We are writing to inform you that the Tax Affairs Department has changed its regulations for this year and formulated new rules that are burdensome and impose heavy fines, which are detrimental to the commercial operations of the tobacco and alcohol industries. In order to protect the interests of the industry, this association has sent representatives to petition various higher-level agencies and repeatedly telegraphed them, appealing for the abolition of these rules. However, after many days, the matter has not been resolved. This stalemate is causing hardship for both the tax authorities and the merchants, and a compromise is urgently needed to achieve the goal of resolving the pain. The first joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the two industries was originally scheduled to be convened on August 10th. Now, in order to plan and address the situation, the meeting is specially advanced to 3:00 PM on the 10th of this month at this association (427 Fumin Road, Dananmen, Nanshi). In addition to sending a separate circular, we hereby send this special letter to you. We urge you to examine this matter and attend the meeting on time. If you are unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances, you should immediately entrust a representative familiar with the history of the tobacco and alcohol industries with official authorization and notify this association in advance in order to comply with the law and facilitate the association's work. This matter concerns the interests of the two industries, so please do not ignore or abandon it. The Joint Association of the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industries, signed by Chen Liangyu, Chairman; Yu Xunlu, Standing Committee Member; Zhang Suhou, Shen Weiting, Cao Gexian, Chairman; Zhang Dalian, Standing Committee Member; Jin Yunjie, Jin Jiayue, Dai Zhuoan, and Chen Weiwen."</p>

<p>The Wusong Health District was established long ago and has achieved remarkable results. Unfortunately, it suffered severe damage during the January 28th Incident, resulting in its suspension, which is a great pity. Last winter, Mayor Wu and Director Li of the Health Bureau and President Weng Zhilong of Tongji University consulted with each other to restore it. The expenses are borne by the Health Bureau and Tongji. In the future, the district will engage in public health and epidemic prevention, and also provide practical training for students of Tongji's Public Health Department. After much preparation, everything is now ready. The committee was established last week. The groundbreaking ceremony for the district office was held on the 8th of this month. Mayor Wu, Director Li, President Weng of Tongji University, Professor Li Xuanguo, and other committee members attended. The future of the district is unlimited.</p>

<p>Regarding the Detention of Bicycles for No Reason</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bicycle Repair and Rental Association sent a letter yesterday to the Municipal Government bureaus, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations regarding the Western police detaining bicycles: "We are writing to inform you that we recently received a petition from dozens of our members in the Xinzha District, including Xin Tongxing, complaining about the Western police in the Xinzha Police Station detaining bicycles for no reason. We have already submitted a petition requesting that measures be taken to stop this, and we were informed that the matter had been forwarded to higher authorities for negotiation and prevention. However, the Western police have now intensified their actions, urging Chinese police officers in various streets to order any bicycles passing by to stop and carry out detentions. The police station is imposing excessive fines, detaining people, and impounding vehicles, engaging in all kinds of insults. Even cyclists with their own bicycles are fined 50 cents, while those renting bicycles are fined 3 yuan. These vehicles have not violated any regulations, and some vehicles were detained just after being pushed out of the shop and before anyone had even gotten on them. Since this happened, the losses suffered by the merchants have been significant. Under these circumstances, who would dare to rent or ride a bicycle? What will become of our industry? We have been operating this business for many years, paying taxes and complying with the Public Works Department's regulations. We are legitimate merchants who should be protected by the police, not arbitrarily destroyed. Moreover, the bicycle originated in Europe and the United States and is now popular in our country. Because it is lightweight and economical, everyone cherishes it. In places where roads have not been built, it can be relied upon to facilitate transportation. Now, under the entire legal system of the Public Works Department, this same unfortunate event does not occur in other police districts, but only in the Xinzha District. If we do not request immediate measures to stop this, our livelihood will be cut off.' Based on this, our association has specially sent responsible representatives Li Xiaoshi, Xu Zhongliang, Chen Langen, and Sun Hongchun to present the hardships to you. We respectfully request that you promptly negotiate with the Police Department of the Public Works Department to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and maintain their business."</p>

<p>Paying Attention to Cheaply Marketed Products</p>
<p>The New Drug Association has repeatedly received reports from various circles stating that various newly emerged epidemic prevention waters on the market are numerous, but their prices are surprisingly low. Not only are they ineffective, but they can even cause death. Deceiving oneself and others is going too far. How can the association, as the collective organization of the new drug industry, not inquire about these harmful drugs? Because the matter concerns social public health, the association issued the following statement after a meeting yesterday: "Epidemic prevention water is an essential medicine for summer emergencies. Not only must the ingredients be specially authentic, but the manufacturing process must also be extremely careful to achieve good results. The member pharmacies of this association hold business licenses approved by the Health Bureau, employ pharmacists registered with the Ministry of Health, and act carefully in accordance with medical principles. Therefore, their products can be guaranteed to be free of the above-mentioned malpractices. Although the cost is high, because it is related to emergency care, we are unwilling to raise prices to make excessive profits, nor do we engage in price-cutting sales. We sincerely hope that all circles will pay attention to this and consider it fortunate."</p>

<p>Fortunately, He Was Rescued After Taking Only a Small Dose of Poison</p>
<p>A Suicide Note Expressing Extreme Sadness and Despair</p>
<p>Eyes Weeping Blood, Heart Turned to Ashes, Unbearable Memories</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, in the Shanghai Shenbao Circulation Library on the third floor of the Er Ma Lu Continental Emporium, a young man came to the reading room to browse newspapers and books. The young man was wearing a white twill cloth shirt, white serge pants, and yellow leather shoes. At 11:15 AM, the young man suddenly</p>
<h3 id="e117">Turned Pale <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>and collapsed to the ground. When discovered by the library staff member Mr. Gu, he thought it was a case of acute痧症 (acute illness) and immediately stepped forward to help him up. Unexpectedly, he was already on the verge of death, vomiting white foam from his mouth non-stop, and unable to speak. Seeing this, Mr. Gu immediately reported the situation to the concession ambulance and the Central Police Station by telephone. Before the police arrived, a note was found on the reading table, which read, "I really don't have the strength to go to Wusong to drown myself, so please forgive me for dying here." Followed by the words "Weakling Le Shang", "same day" etc. After this note was discovered, it was known that the young man had</p>

<p>A paper package was also found beside him, containing several letters, as well as short pants, a fountain pen, a handkerchief, and a suicide note addressed to his lover and a few words written on the eve of the suicide, which are transcribed below. After a while, Police Officer No. 287 and an ambulance arrived. They immediately took the young man to Renji Hospital for treatment. Upon arrival, the doctor quickly diagnosed that he had attempted suicide by ingesting raw opium. Fortunately, the poisoning was not deep, and he was able to be saved. After 4:00 PM,</p>

<p>and he was out of danger. When asked why he attempted suicide, he resolutely refused to reveal the truth. When asked about his family background and residence, he only said that his surname was Yu, his name was Mogeng, he was from Yixing, he was 24 years old, he had studied in Hangzhou, and he was currently unemployed. He also had no residence in Shanghai. After 8:00 PM in the evening, his spirit had fully recovered, and he was discharged from the hospital safely at around 9:00 PM. Judging from the letters he wrote before his suicide, it can be inferred that Jin Mogeng is now unemployed and has a lover (referred to as Hong in the letters) who abandoned him due to his unemployment, leading to loneliness and unhappiness. He felt that life was meaningless, so he developed a pessimistic view of the world and attempted suicide by taking poison yesterday morning. The suicide note to his lover and a new-style poem, as well as a few words written before the suicide, are transcribed below:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Letter to Lover <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>(1) Hong, I don't hate you, nor do I hate your current lover, Jin. In short, in this whole society filled with the stench of money, pure love can never exist. What is called love in today's society is just a term for the mutual self-deception of both parties based on emotional or carnal impulses and mutual needs. You must know that in an unreasonable society, there is unreasonable married life. I am a high-spirited man who has wasted his time until now, stubborn as ever, and of course, I must bravely struggle forward. However, this letter was originally intended to be a complete and systematic text, but looking back on the past, it is unbearable to recall. My eyes are weeping blood, my heart is turned to ashes. My heart wants to write, but my strength is not enough, so I have to put down my pen, forever put down my pen. July 3, 1933. (2) Hong, you are unfaithful, you are truly unfaithful, you have let me down until now. I remember when we sang softly and talked intimately, one word was worth a thousand gold. Now I have become a lonely figure, autumn wind, withered grass, and deep white clouds. Where can I find the broken bridge and flowing water? Desolate, miserable, cold, and lonely, Grass me,</p>
<h3 id="e121">Words Before Suicide <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(A few words on the eve of suicide) I am unwilling to flatter and fawn, nor am I capable of cleverly seizing and plundering. In this deformed society, it is natural that I cannot find a job, and it is natural that I am looked down upon and ridiculed. The pressure I have suffered in life is already extremely unbearable, and at the same time, my companion who has been my only comfort in the past three years of mutual dependence...</p>

<p>Police Declare Withdrawal of Appeal</p>
<p>Alexander Morrison, a Russian national and the director of the chemical supplies department of the Soviet Assistance Association at No. 2 Beijing Road, was recently criticized by the Soviet authorities for not diligently carrying out the political work assigned to him in China by the Soviet Defense Political Bureau. Therefore, Markov was selected to come to China to take over the political work from Morrison. After Markov arrived in Shanghai, he organized an active working committee, with Morrison as one of the members, to carry out the work. However, Morrison was under heavy surveillance everywhere, which prevented him from proceeding, and his opinions differed from Markov's. There was a plan to send Morrison back to Moscow. Morrison, fearing that he would be executed like several others who had been sent back to Russia, abandoned his post and fled to Hankou to avoid the situation. Markov, fearing that Morrison would leak secrets, accused Morrison of embezzling 25,000 silver dollars. Morrison, upon hearing the news, rushed back to Shanghai and surrendered himself. After investigation by the First Special District Court, he was found not guilty. The police declared an appeal, and Morrison was ordered to post bail. This matter has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, declared the withdrawal of the appeal to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division 1. Judge Qian, since the police did not appeal, ordered the cancellation of Morrison's bail.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Barber Industry Gao An Snow Vindication Committee held its 14th executive committee meeting at the Nan Shi Xie Qiao Barber Association yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Committee members Xue Guangdian, Guan Zhihe, Luo Shantao, Pan Zhenshan, Zhang Yujin, Qian Shouling, Wang Changxing, Chen Youshou, and 19 other committee members attended the meeting. Gao Yuanlin, the father of the deceased, and Hu Shunyuan, representing Guo Wanhai, were also present. The standing committee member Chen Sijiang was elected as the chairman. After the formalities were completed, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that since the Gao case occurred,</p>
<p>it has been two months, and negotiations have been hopeless. The anger of the industry is extraordinary. If this continues, the matter will inevitably end without resolution. However, for the sake of our own interests, we, the industry, must seek a final solution to comfort the deceased's soul and uphold justice. Next, various committee members spoke one after another to discuss the progress of negotiations on the Gao case. It was decided to hold the second industry congress on a fixed date and submit a large petition to various agencies at the same time after the congress. All members unanimously approved the decision. Next, the method of convening the congress was discussed. Because many members of the industry in the North and South Municipal Concessions are concerned about overcrowding the venue when meetings are held on the same day, it was decided to convene meetings in separate districts over four days. The date of the meeting will be July 17 for members of the French Concession, July 18 for members of the British Concession, July 19 for members of the Nan Shi, July 20 for members of the Zhabei, and July 21 for the general congress of representatives of the city's industry. At the same time, a large petition will be held, and a report will be submitted to the party and government agencies in advance, requesting that personnel be sent to provide guidance at that time. The slogans and banners for the petition parade will be prepared at the next standing committee meeting. Next, the committee discussed expanding publicity, issuing a declaration, and decided on the name "Rongguang Newspaper Gao An Special Issue". The publication date was passed as the 5th of each month. Next, the committee discussed expanding unity and decided that as long as the Gao case is not resolved satisfactorily, we, the industry, will not stop taking action until the final victory is achieved to protect the right to survival of our nation. Next, the committee discussed the legal proceedings and requested the Yangzhou Association and other associations, the Gao case support group, and various major lawyers to seek legal remedies. However, regarding mediation, Chairman Du of the French Concession Taxpayers' Association was requested to proceed as soon as possible to achieve a peaceful resolution. Next, Gao Yuanlin, the father of the deceased, reported the difficult living conditions. Next, Guo Wanhai reported the industry's donation situation. After the above cases were discussed and decided, the chairman reported on the income and expenditure accounts. The discussion continued until about 1:00 PM, when the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Mental Hospital to Open Soon <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Gu Wenjun, an expert in treating mental illness in this area, is a seventh-generation doctor in Chuansha, specializing in the treatment of dementia, scrofula, shortness of breath, phlegm, asthma, and other diseases. He has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for nearly 30 years and has long been renowned. Dr. Gu recently observed that although there are many hospitals in Shanghai, there is still a lack of specialized treatment places for mental illnesses. In recent years, national disasters have been frequent, and many people are unemployed. It is often heard that they are in financial straits and suffer from external stimuli, causing them to become mentally ill due to anxiety. If not treated immediately, they will become disabled in mild cases and lose their lives in severe cases. Dr. Gu has a benevolent heart and deeply sympathizes with them. Therefore, he gathered colleagues Yuan Xiluo, Xie Qianggong, Wu Zonglian, Qiao Nianchun, Pan Yu Cang, and Pan Shiqing to initiate the organization of a specialized mental hospital. After several months of preparation, things have gradually come to fruition. Houses No. 22, 23, and 24 in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, have been leased as the hospital site. All the start-up expenses are initially advanced by the initiators, and the amount is quite considerable. It is reported that philanthropists such as Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and other gentlemen, as well as Duan Feihe, Li Sihao, and other celebrities, all support Dr. Gu's initiative, which is purely for the benefit of the poor and sick. The hospital is said to officially open at the end of this month.</p>

It was a gift from relatives and friends for his mother's 70th birthday. Mr. Huang's original letter stated, "To whom it may concern, on June 12th of this year, my mother celebrated her 70th birthday. Relatives and friends all planned to offer her congratulations, but my mother believes that the country is in urgent need of help and does not want to be extravagant and increase her guilt. She repeatedly refused, but was unable to resist the wishes of the crowd, so she reluctantly prepared wine on that day to celebrate. All the gifts, totaling about 215 silver dollars, have been transferred to the defense of the country. I hereby remit this amount to you and request that you collect it. Sincerely, Huang Shiying, Wuying Town, Huaiyin County, to the China Aviation Association."

<p>Xu Aina, a dancer at the Datong Dance Hall, had previously signed a service contract with the dance hall, but before the contract expired, she suddenly switched to another dance hall as a dancer. The owner of the Datong Dance Hall sued her in the First District Court. Initially, the dancer claimed that she was illiterate and did not know the contents of the contract, and Datong's lawsuit was dismissed. Recently, it was reported that the owner of the Datong Dance Hall was dissatisfied and collected sufficient evidence to prove that Xu Aina was indeed literate and that she had entered another dance hall as a dancer immediately after resigning from Datong, which was obviously a breach of contract. Therefore, they filed an appeal. After the Jiangsu High Second Branch Court reviewed the case and understood the situation, it ruled on the 4th that Xu Aina had violated the contract and ordered her to compensate the appellant for the losses.</p>

<p>Wang Yujiang, a 52-year-old native of Ningbo, lived at No. 68 Beikaier Road and earned his living by selling vegetables. The other day, he and more than a dozen companions were traveling to the Xiaodongmen vegetable market in Nanshi on a truck numbered 16536 to sell vegetables. On the way back, when the truck was driving near Liaoyang Road on Huade Road, Wang's hat was suddenly blown off by the wind. Wang, in a moment of panic, disregarded everything and jumped off the truck in an attempt to retrieve the hat, causing him to be crushed by the truck's wheels on his feet and other places, suffering severe injuries. His companions immediately took him to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but he died soon after. The hospital reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue, examined the body, and conducted a public hearing. According to Huang Jinqing, a vegetable seller, he was sitting in the same car with Wang on that day, and Wang did not tell the others when he jumped off to pick up his hat, so the driver was also unaware, which led to this unfortunate incident. Wu Yuming, the truck driver, stated that the deceased did not order him to stop at the time, so he was not aware of the situation. After obtaining the statements, Guo ruled that the deceased, Wang Yujiang, had died due to injuries to his feet caused by being crushed before his death. The body was handed over to his wife, Wang Sangshi, who signed a guarantee to take the body back for burial.</p>

<p>Decision on Building Permanent Barracks Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>The commander of the Public Concession Businessmen's Corps reported to the Security Committee that the Public Bureau houses at the Xiamen Road prison site would soon be demolished, and that one detachment of the Russian personnel currently stationed in the wooden houses there had been temporarily transferred to the barracks at the target range. By the beginning of September, when the wooden houses at the target range were needed for other purposes, the wooden houses on Xiamen Road could be moved to the target range as well. The cost of this relocation was estimated at 7,000 taels. When new buildings were rebuilt on the Xiamen Road base, a permanent residence should be provided for the entire Russian detachment. The head of the finance department said that he agreed with the relocation of the wooden houses, but the issue of permanent barracks could be discussed when the construction plan for 1934 was proposed. The head of the public works department then presented drawings for the reconstruction of the Xiamen Road site, in which the intermediate section was planned to be used for permanent barracks, but it would not be possible to start until 1935. The permanent relocation of the wooden houses to the target range was also feasible, and the maintenance costs would not be high, and the relocation would only take a few weeks. After deliberation, the committee believed that a portion of the Xiamen Road base should be used for barracks in the future, and that the existing wooden houses should be moved to the target range immediately. When the Russian detachment no longer needed them, they would remain there for the public use of the Businessmen's Corps. This case was submitted to the board of directors and has been adopted and implemented.</p>

<p>Qi Genlin's Wild Idea</p>
<p>Police Find Real Evidence</p>
<p>Recently, fortune telling stalls, gambling dens, and ships for gambling on the Huangpu River have sprung up in the Nanshi area. However, due to the strict investigation and prohibition by the authorities, in order to avoid attention, the gangs send their members out daily to lure people into gambling, disguising themselves as workers and other types of people. Qi Genlin, a native of Nanjing, is 25 years old and lives at No. 14 Zhaoma Road, 16th Shop, Nanshi. Qi is inherently part of this trade. He recently had a wild idea to disguise himself as a fortune teller and set up a fortune-telling stall on the sidewalk in front of Hengda Ginseng Shop at No. 64 Zhonghua Road, Xiaodongmen, claiming to help people interpret characters, tell fortunes, and read faces, but in reality, the almanacs and books on physiognomy placed on his stall all contained gambling receipts for gambling and detailed dream books. He secretly lured ignorant men and women to interpret their dreams and gamble on gambling. The gambling money he collected was sent to the big factory. Qi personally made a profit of more than ten yuan every day, leading a comfortable life without anyone noticing, and he felt complacent. Unexpectedly, his good luck did not last long. Director Liu of the First District, Second Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned of the situation and dispatched police officer Gong Weichuan, Li Fuyi, and others to the site at about 11:00 AM yesterday to arrest Qi Genlin. They confiscated a large number of gambling receipts and gambling money from his stall and took them back to the station along with the fortune-telling stall. After the director's preliminary interrogation, the case will be reviewed and handled.</p>

She became acquainted with a man named Xu Arong, 28 years old, who works as a tea server at lawyer Yin Ruxiong's office on Beijing Road, and earns quite well. Initially, Lin and Xu's affair was conducted discreetly, to preserve Huang Achang's reputation. However, since Huang became unemployed, Afeng became completely uninhibited, frequently inviting Xu to her home for secret rendezvous, causing gossip and spreading scandalous rumors. The night before last (the 5th), Xu went to Afeng's house again to continue their pleasure, and did not leave until midnight, causing Huang to become unbearably angry and enraged. He grabbed Xu, and with fists and feet, beat him, injuring his chest, limbs, back, and other areas, leaving him covered in wounds.

<p>The dispute over the Anhui Huaining District Secondary School Examination has been reported in previous reports. On July 1, when the examination began, students said that the test questions had been leaked and filed a lawsuit in court. At that time, all male high school and junior high school students completely boycotted the exam, while only female students took the exam as usual. However, students from Anqing Middle School and other schools who took the exam were unwilling to boycott the exam and were beaten by students from other schools who were exempted from the exam, so they went to the Education Department to take refuge and took the exam in the Education Department on the 2nd. High school students from other counties negotiated with the Education Department to return to their schools to take the exam separately under the supervision of the Education Department. The students from the four schools of Anqing No. 1 Middle School, Huaining Middle School, Liuyi Middle School, and Baoluo Middle School boycotted the exam from beginning to end. The provincial government decided not to allow students from these schools to take the exam again and severely punish the students who took the lead in causing trouble. The high school students also boycotted the exam most strongly at the beginning. Yesterday, they confessed their mistakes to the Education Department, and the Education Department has allowed them to take a makeup exam. Also, Guo Xianzhong, the principal of Anqing Middle School, was slightly injured by the boycotting students for leading the students to take the exam. In this case, the dispute over the Huaining District Examination can be completely resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e162">National Vocational Education Association Discusses the Issue of Implementing Vocational Education in Prisons <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The National Vocational Education Discussion Conference is scheduled to be held in Kaifeng on the 9th of this month. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The conference will have a precise discussion on the issue of implementing vocational education in prisons in various regions. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the Judicial and Administrative Department for circulation and implementation. The full text of the case is recorded below for reference.</p>
<p>According to the general evaluation of sociologists, the causes of crime can be generally said to be nothing more than sexual desire and economic problems, but among the two problems, economic problems are the root cause. Modern prisons are not only institutions for enforcing punishment, but also places for rehabilitation. Therefore, most prisons in modern cities have factories attached to them, so that prisoners can learn relevant vocational education skills, so that they can have a means of making a living after being released from prison. This is really a fundamental way to clear crimes, but according to on-the-spot investigations, the vocational education in prisons in our country now mostly does not conform to the principles of education, has no scientific methods, and the prisons with factories are limited to large cities. There are very few county towns with prison factories. The association should try to improve the factories in prisons in large cities and implement vocational education in county prisons without factories. The method is that the research department of the association should study the specific plan for the implementation of vocational education in prisons and submit it to the Judicial and Administrative Department for circulation to prisons in various cities and counties to earnestly implement vocational education.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Cao Yihua took office as the director of studies at Wuben Girls' High School, he has made many reforms in the past three years and has won the trust of the principal. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government announced that he would be the principal of Donghai Normal School. The Wuben faculty and staff could not retain him and deeply regretted his departure. Therefore, at 6 pm yesterday, they held a banquet at Yizhixiang to bid him farewell. During the banquet, Lu An and Wang Peizhen delivered speeches successively, which were followed by a thank you speech by Mr. Cao. He said that Donghai is located in the northeast of Jiangsu Province, close to Shandong. The customs and habits of the people are very strong towards the north, which is different from the situation where the north-south culture has been opened up. Moreover, this school has been divided into 18 grades. Since it was changed to a normal school, there are only 12 grades in the high and junior two departments with six classes each. Although the students who come to study are poor, the study style is noisy and very difficult to manage, which is completely different from Wuben. For the sake of cultivating teachers, I will make every effort to rectify it, so as to create normal school talents for the country and society, so as to achieve the effect of popularizing education in the future. As for the employment of teachers, I advocate talentism, and so on. The banquet ended at about 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Business Leaders Retain President Xu of the Business School <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Since Mr. Xu Peikun became the president of the National Shanghai Business School, he has achieved remarkable results, and talents have emerged in large numbers over the years, making great contributions to the society. Recently, someone incited a wave of unrest, hoping to disrupt Mr. Xu's work. He was so overwhelmed that he suddenly had the intention of retiring. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi and other business leaders in Shanghai believed that the Business School was the highest business school in Shanghai. Mr. Xu had been the president for many years and had made many plans. Once he retired, all his previous efforts would be wasted. Therefore, they telegraphed Chairman Jiang and Education Minister Wang a few days ago to retain him unanimously. The original telegram said, "Chairman Jiang of the Nanchang Camp, Shanghai Business School President Xu Peikun is devoted to running the school and is admired. Recently, someone has incited a wave of unrest, hoping to disrupt it. Please telegraph Education Minister Wang to protect it, so that Shanghai's highest business school can continue to develop as usual. I am very grateful and hope so. In addition to telegraphing Education Minister Wang, I hereby telegraph this and pray for a reply. Yu Hede, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Yongming, and others kowtow." It is reported that Chairman Jiang has replied to Shanghai, saying that the Ministry of Education will be able to handle it fairly. Yu and others are very satisfied. On the one hand, they have been trying to persuade Mr. Xu not to retire. According to the New Voice Agency, the Shanghai Business School has always been very short of funds, and all facilities have not been able to proceed actively on schedule. President Xu Peikun felt the difficulty of having no rice to cook and once expressed his negativity to the former Education Minister Zhu. Last week, he went to Beijing to meet Education Minister Wang Shijie and reiterated his previous request. After Education Minister Wang earnestly retained him and persuaded him from various parties, Mr. Xu returned to the school to preside over the school affairs, considering that he had been in the education sector for nearly 20 years and that the overall education plan was a matter of responsibility, especially during the national crisis. He should make efforts to maintain it, and he returned to the school that day to preside over the school affairs and carry out all the school affairs for the next semester.</p>
<h3 id="e174">News from the China Correspondence School of Accountancy <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The China Correspondence School of Accountancy, located at 1154 Xinzha Road, Shanghai, was founded by Accountant Shen Liren and has been painstakingly managed with remarkable results. The compilation of the school's textbooks for each subject is the most novel. It is said that the compilation was preceded by a long period of research and trial-and-error methods. The compiled textbooks were given to those who did not know bookkeeping and accounting to read and test them, and only after they were thoroughly understood. Therefore, the compilation of the textbooks is very different from the ordinary readers on the market. They are specially compiled for correspondence courses. Since the school was opened, the total number of students has reached more than 2,000, and the first edition of the textbooks has been sold out. For the sake of excellence, Accountant Shen took the opportunity of the reprinting to revise the contents of each subject and made many improvements. It is reported that the reprinted textbooks have been printed a few days ago. In order to collect opinions and use them for reference, Accountant Shen specially gave many copies of the new edition of the textbooks to domestic accounting groups, educational institutions and accounting experts to solicit criticism. Recently, he has received replies from all parties, praising its proper compilation, clear and willing language, detailed examples, and exquisite printing, making it the only good book for accounting correspondence in China. The school also has trial reading materials for those who are interested in studying bookkeeping and accounting.</p>

<p>After giving up the first set, Cochet showed obvious improvement in the second set, serving more powerfully and returning the opponent's serves more effectively. The left and right cross-shots almost made Vines's pace chaotic, and he once led 5-2. But at this point, Vines began to use cannonballs and explosive pressure to make Cochet confused.

<h3 id="e186">The North China Games Are About to Open <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>To be held in Qingdao from the 12th to the 15th of this month</p>
<p>The architectural form of the venue is magnificent and can be called unparalleled in China</p>
<p>(Qingdao Correspondence) The North China Sports Federation, which bears a major mission in the Chinese sports world, has been working hard to hold sports games for many years, and has held 17 sessions so far. Its long history has promoted the development of the national spirit in China, which is not shallow. Since the 17th session was decided to be held in Qingdao this year, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie said that the holding of the conference is related to the development of sports in the city. In addition to telegraphing the North China Sports Federation to express his welcome, he immediately began to build a large-scale public sports field for the conference. On the one hand, he hired people from all walks of life to organize a preparatory committee. Now, the opening of the conference is less than ten days away (July 12-15). The construction of the venue and the preparation of the conference affairs are described as follows:</p>
<p>Overview of the Venue Qingdao has the beauty of mountains and seas, and the construction of the North China venue is located in the center of the beautiful scenery. The venue includes a track and field field (including a football field), six tennis courts, four volleyball courts (also used as a martial arts field), a baseball field, and a swimming pool using the natural seaside and adding appropriate facilities. The main track and field field is modeled after the Los Angeles World Sports Field in the United States, which is concrete and subtle, but the magnificence of the project and the beauty of the environment are unparalleled by sports fields in other parts of the country. The situation is described as follows: ㈠ The form of the stands is determined by the form of the track. The length of the outer circle is more than 590 meters, and the length of the inner circle is more than 540 meters. The entire venue is symmetrically arranged east and west. There are a total of 15 rows of seats for the audience, which can accommodate more than 15,000 spectators. The audience seats are made of reinforced concrete. The inner and outer walls of the stands are made of granite ice crack lines. There are 11 entrance doors for spectators and 2 entrance doors for athletes around the stands except for the main entrance. There are 4 entrances and exits for athletes in the inner circle of the stands. All of the stands under the east, west and south straight lines are used for athletes to rest. There are 32 rest rooms, 4 bathrooms, and 8 male and female toilets. Each entrance door for spectators has 1 male and female toilet. There are a total of 30 toilets. The middle part of the east and west sides of the stands is the rostrum and the VIP seats. ㈡ The form of the track is blue curved, also known as the normal form, which was created by German Dr. Timm. The straight part is 130 meters long and the field is 72 meters wide. If measured along the outer three centimeters of the inner circle of the track, the length of one circle is exactly 400 meters. The suitability of the form goes without saying. Each field event is arranged in it. The entire field is covered with grass except for the track and field events, which is especially beautiful. ㈢ The main entrance of the track and field field is located at the north end of the stands, with a total of three floors. The first floor is the aisle, and there are three arched entrance doors. The second floor is the conference hall, and the third floor is the office. There is a large clock in the center of the roof, which is very convenient. It takes 11 steps to climb from the west road to the first floor of the main entrance, which is about 2 meters high, so pedestrians on the road cannot see the movements of the athletes in the field.</p>
<p>Preparation Situation The Preparatory Committee of the 17th North China Games was organized by the city government by hiring people from all walks of life in the city. Lei Fazhang (Director of the Education Bureau) was elected as the director of the preparation, and Hao Gengsheng (Director of Physical Education of Shandong University) was the general secretary. The preparatory committee is divided into ten departments: General Affairs, Competition, Engineering Reception, Arrangement, Publicity, Awards, Health, Discipline, and Martial Arts. Each department has a director and deputy director, who are responsible for the progress respectively. Since the establishment of the preparatory committee, four preparatory meetings have been held. The joint meetings of each department were initially held once every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Later, due to the approaching date of the conference, it was changed to working at the preparatory committee every day. The budget of the conference, excluding the engineering item, is a total of more than 39,100 yuan. With regard to the reception, Mayor Shen Honglie, in order to give the participants of each unit a good impression, everything must be done carefully. The athlete reception method, the referee reception method, and the press reporter reception method have all been carefully planned and stipulated. Therefore, the North China Conference held in the beautiful Qingdao enjoys comfortable reception. At that time, the athletes from the provinces and cities of North China will gallop on the field, which is a great event for the future development of the North China Conference.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting The venue project is about to be completed, and the opening of the conference is imminent. In order to understand the situation of the venue and step up their work, the preparatory committee inspected the venue project at 11 am on the 3rd and took a group photo. After lunch at the male athlete dormitory, the fourth preparatory meeting was held. The directors of each department attended the meeting. Mayor Shen Honglie also participated. After the meeting, the directors of each department reported on the status of the work of each department. Then Mayor Shen gave instructions on the matters that each department should pay attention to. Then they began to discuss the matters that should be carried out at the conference, and the meeting did not end until 5 pm. All the preparatory staff were in high spirits. The conference can be said to have gained the advantages of people and harmony.</p>
<p>Participating in the Grand Event Because the conference is held in Qingdao, the provinces, cities, and regions of North China are actively participating. After the registration deadline, the total number of participating units includes Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Beiping, Qingdao, Weihai, and other twelve provinces, cities, and regions. There are 715 male athletes and 319 female athletes, totaling 1,034. It is expected that the conference will be more enthusiastic than the 16th session. What is worth commemorating is that although the recovery of the Northeast has no date, the athletes of the three northeastern provinces are still working hard to participate, hoping to make the flags of the provinces fly at the conference site, so as to encourage the Chinese people. Therefore, the significance of holding this conference is not only to promote physical education, but also for the Chinese people to rise up.</p>

All members who have joined can go to the association at 316 Xizang Road, Mulhall Church, to attend classes. Women who want to understand the correct posture of race walking can also go to listen to the lecture. It is reported that the association will compile race walking lectures and distribute them to everyone. In addition, since the association began soliciting, new members have joined enthusiastically, and old members continue to fill out application forms to become members. However, there are dozens of return letters that the association sent to old members due to changes in address, changes in house numbers, and demolition of houses. The association sincerely hopes that the members will send letters to correct them so that they can send letters again.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Should Invite Wang Shifu to be the Defense Lawyer</p>
<p>Among the myriad of strange occurrences on the Shanghai Bund, there is a bizarre story of a postman colluding with two young men to privately open letters sent to a young woman.</p>
<p>Postman Ye Woyun of number 166 is too meddlesome; how could he not deliver letters sent to a young woman to the young woman, but instead give them to irrelevant wicked youths to peek at next to the leather tanning stall in the alleyway? Now that the matter has been confirmed, he has been detained and sent to the criminal court, prosecuted for the crime of obstructing privacy under Article 333 of the Criminal Law. This is Ye Woyun bringing disaster upon himself, and everyone believes he should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Love letters on postcards can certainly be enjoyed first by the green-clad messenger; the sender has paid a little more postage, and once sealed with paste, has obtained the right to secret freedom. The postman has the obligation to deliver letters, but no right to open them. The criminal charges Ye Woyun has committed are very difficult to defend him against. If one wants to defend him, one would have to summon Hongniang from the "Romance of the Western Chamber".</p>
<p>In the "Noisy Chapters", Hongniang sings, "When have you ever seen someone sending letters secretly hiding them from the fish and geese?" Since Hongniang says so, it can be seen that the sender in Hongniang's mind should not hide the contents of the letter from the fish and geese; and those who act as fish and geese have the right to know the secrets in the sender's letter. Ye Woyun acts as a postman, which is acting as a fish and goose. If he can invite Sister Hongniang, who transmits letters and delivers messages, to be his defense attorney, and present "When have you ever seen someone sending letters secretly hiding them from the fish and geese?" as the major reason for the defense, I think Ye Woyun can certainly be declared innocent. Moreover, Sister Hongniang has profound legal knowledge. "Meixiang punishes the quince" was all Sister Hongniang declaring the sentence for the young lady when "cleverly sitting in court." With such eloquence, to reverse the injustice for Ye Woyun, there would naturally be no such thing as fish and geese eating lawsuits.</p>
<p>However, the author of "Romance of the Western Chamber" is generally known to be Mr. Wang Shifu. Rather than inviting Sister Hongniang to be the defense attorney, it would be better to invite Mr. Wang Shifu to be the defense attorney; only because the words in Hongniang's mouth are the articles under Wang Shifu's pen. Jin Shengtan, in his criticism of "Romance of the Western Chamber," most admired this sentence, "When have you ever seen someone sending letters secretly hiding them from the fish and geese?" He commented, "Strange, strange, wonderful, wonderful, from Pangu until this day, there has truly never been such a thing, nor has there ever been such writing." Wang Shifu's magical power of words can make Shengtan this kind of disoriented, which is certainly not easy to do.</p>
<p>Ye Woyun, who is eating a lawsuit, doesn't need to be afraid. Quickly go to the world of six hundred years ago and invite this Yuan Dynasty lyricist, Mr. Wang Shifu, to be your pro bono lawyer, and you can escape unscathed.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Lullaby <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Yi-yi</p>
<p>"Don't be noisy, don't make a fuss, baby wants to sleep."</p>
<p>This is a section of a very popular lullaby in Shanghai. Almost everyone has heard it; every young student and every woman knows how to sing it!</p>
<p>If you run to the dazzling crossroads, then you can hear the various ballads and songs broadcast on the radio in front of the big stores. Many people will gather together spontaneously, raising their heads to listen. But the strange thing is, you raise your head to listen, and sometimes, a nasal lullaby will play in that little wooden box; whether it is in the morning or afternoon, it will always lull you to sleep with "Don't be noisy, don't make a fuss, baby wants to sleep"! In reality, you can't sleep, right?</p>
<p>Some merchants still hire military bands to blow big drums there; however, they are also very fashionable, blowing and beating lullabies; if you run from far away, you can hear the sounds of "dee dee dee" and "dong dong dong"!</p>
<p>Ah! Our compatriots originally all like to be fashionable! But in general, they will blindly copy patterns; and not know whether this matter is appropriate or not?</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers have invaded a section of our country's territory, so telegrams and shouts, meetings and cries, seem to be very patriotic; but what is the use of this kind of irrelevant thing? Perhaps it is because of this reason, so there is the rise of the lullaby by clever people, intending to avoid the turbulent world, but I hope this lullaby does not wake people up.</p>
<p>Let the compatriots sleep forever, sleep for a thousand days and a thousand years; it's good to wait until they wake up in the future, the Japanese will bring face wash water to wash your face and prepare breakfast for you to eat.</p>

<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>When you first attack her, she is indeed an exceptionally noble and mysterious woman; but, after your hope is realized, all her nobility and mystery will naturally disappear!</p>
<p>If you suffer the arrogance of a proud woman, you must patiently strive to pursue her. Once you are victorious, the day she loves you is the time for your revenge!</p>
<p>The clock is the most cunning thing. When you have a date with your lover, it will definitely hesitate to move forward, deliberately making things difficult for you; but after you meet your lover, it will run wildly in quick steps. Ah! Clock! You really know how to play with people!</p>
<p>When you hold your lover's slender waist and walk slowly on the street, all the scenery is set up for you; but after you are lovelorn, that beautiful scenery will suddenly turn into a desolate ruin!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Summer Streets <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>The summer sun has set a fire, and the asphalt roads are all scorched! The rickshaw pullers are barefoot, running like ants on a hot pot!</p>
<p>"Damn it! Murderous bastard! Running so slow!" The curse of a woman with bare thighs.</p>
<p>"Pull faster! Pig!" The curse of an urban young master.</p>
<p>Soybean-sized beads of sweat drip straight down, the soles of the feet stepping on the hot road are blistering, but for the price of two dimes, to support their wives, children, and daughters, they have to risk their lives to pull!</p>
<p>The ice banner, crying with a sad face in the sunlight, large glass windows display ice cream, soda, shaved ice, roses, bananas, lemons...</p>
<p>Red lips, holding white straws, dim green lights, reflecting simply dressed waiters, electric fans turning, ice machines flowing, standing on the street, entering an ice room is at least thirty degrees cooler.</p>
<p>Clear and cool mung bean soup, jelly, cold noodles, watermelon stalls, green bottle flies buzzing around, flying back and forth. On the electric poles, there are posters: "Prevent Cholera"! Standing under the traffic lights, the red-headed Indian, sweating, his multi-bearded purple face, has also been tanned by the red sun!</p>
<p>A modern girl holds up a pink parasol, covering the upper half of her body, in a thin silk cheongsam, still shaking her head and shouting that it's hot.</p>
<p>A pug sticks out its long tongue and pants, saliva flows to the ground, and it dries with a "zhi" sound.</p>
<p>In the corner, a small beggar, naked, has come to a public model.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Come On! Have a Cup of Ice Cream <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Come on, have a cup of ice cream, in the hot weather,</p>
<p>When you are dripping with sweat, everyone loves to hear these words.</p>
<p>But ice cream also has different grades. In noble cold drink shops, drinking a cup might cost a good few dimes, plus a tip, which isn't a poor person's daily ration? The ten-cent-a-cup shouted along the street is probably unreliable. If you drink it, you will definitely sit in a white car and be sent to the epidemic hospital. Even more severely, it may freeze your forehead, freezing down to your heels. It's really not worth it to be greedy and lose your poor life!</p>
<p>Forget it! With your kind of publicity, cold drink shop owners are afraid to fight with you to the death; people who love cold drinks may not take these words as golden rules. Now I also have a cup of ice cream to offer to everyone.</p>
<p>In the "Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations" written by Mr. Ji Xiaolan,</p>
<p>There is a passage that says: "A certain scholar's study was narrow and cramped, almost impossible to raise his head. The door had no curtain, the bed had no mosquito net, the courtyard had no trees. After a long drought, it was hot and humid, as if sitting in a steaming pot. He took off his clothes for an afternoon nap, but the flies were disturbing him and he couldn't close his eyes. He was so annoyed that he could hardly bear it, and he thought of this as a fiery hell. After a long time, he fell asleep from exhaustion. He dreamed of riding a boat in the sea. A hurricane suddenly arose, the sky and sun were dark, the masts were broken and the sails were torn, and he was terrified. In an instant, the boat capsized. It seemed someone pulled him out and threw him on the shore. Then someone held a rope to bind him and locked him in a cellar. It was dark and he couldn't see anything, and his breathing was also suffocated and blocked. The horror and distress were indescribable. Suddenly, he heard a shout in his ear. He suddenly opened his eyes, and he was still lying on the three-legged wooden bed. He felt comfortable in his limbs and refreshed in his mind, as if he were in a fairyland."</p>
<p>The residents of Shanghai all live in pigeon coop-like houses, and their annoyance is almost the same as that of the scholar. When you are too hot to bear, please read the above passage, and I know that many people will put their hands together and recite:</p>
<p>Cool! Cool! It is sweet dew, it is ice cream, the heat is completely gone, together we ascend to a cool world.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Northeast Fourth Company Commander <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Hearing the words, Jingfang's heart quickens, the wish to be ennobled is vague, listening to songs reveals emotion, serving the country is leisurely. Thinking like this, during the five-minute break on the stage, Guizhi finally couldn't bear it and smiled and asked Man Ying: "What is the name of this brigade commander?" Man Ying said: "His surname is Ma. Two years ago, he wasn't very rich. Luck came and he became a brigade commander within two years." Guizhi said: "Aren't the affairs of the three northeastern provinces not yet settled? Soldiers should all be busy. How can he have time to listen to operas? I see your Company Commander Tian. To enter the city once, you have to wait a week. He is still busy coming and going. How can someone who has become a brigade commander be so leisurely?" Man Ying smiled and said: "Company Commander Tian is just Company Commander Tian. Why do you bring up you two? I don't lead troops, where does the company commander come from?" Guizhi glanced at him and smiled, "I'm not wrong." Man Ying smiled, "It doesn't matter if you're wrong, it doesn't matter to me." Guizhi didn't want to chat idly, and brought the topic back to the main point, saying: "I heard that it's not easy for a company commander to be promoted to a brigade commander." Man Ying said: "That depends on a person's luck. When that person's luck comes, closing the door won't stop it. If the superior wants to promote him, what can you do?" Guizhi said: "He just got promoted out of thin air like this, hasn't he fought in any battles?" Man Ying said: "Look at his handsome young appearance, can he fight in battles?" Guizhi said: "According to you, there are also soldiers who pick up an official to do." Man Ying said: "Who says there aren't? " Jiangshi heard the young lady always asking about that brigade commander, as if she admired him very much. Her heart moved, and she said, "Originally, now only doing military work is the easiest to get promoted and become rich." Guizhi said: "If the military officers were all like this Brigade Commander Ma, bringing a new wife to listen to operas, then it would be okay to do it." These few words of hers were generally speaking about people, but when Huang Man Ying heard them, he already understood her interests. (122)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3 id="e195">Summer in Shanghai <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The God of Time tells us, "I have advanced into summer." In this way, the scene of a fiery umbrella hanging high and hot air everywhere seems to unfold before our eyes. I am most afraid of the heat. The source of heat is emitted from the sunlight. To put it simply, I am afraid of "white." How fierce it is, how cruel. Good green grass, given a shine by it, changes color; good flowers, given a shine by it, immediately lower their heads. Little birds, given a shine by it, will stop singing; little yellow dogs, given a shine by it, will stick out their tongues. Even people, seeing it, will not dare to go out. The only thing that agrees with it is the stench-chasing fly, flying around in groups. Sun! It's rare for you to have such a good friend. Otherwise, I think you're too monotonous! Too miserable!</p>
<p>The compatriots in North China are certainly not in the minority. Suffering the sorrow of lost land, their families broken, their people dead! What else is there to say! These are all "sun"-given rewards. They are also like me, seeing the "sun" and being afraid, and having no resistance, and the situation is the same. But my fear of the "sun" can be sitting at home; or drinking a bottle of soda, eating a piece of watermelon. What about the compatriots in North China! Without their families, their relatives died tragically. Resistance is of course out of the question, but even their own lives are difficult to protect! Then, the same fear of the "sun," the situation is different.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>"A ghost in the morning, a person dressed up in the evening." These two sentences are for the fashionable women of Shanghai. Of course, there are many who are naturally beautiful, but those like the above two sentences are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges! When they get up in the morning, their clothes are unkempt, their hair is disheveled—this may be my misunderstanding, now hair that shines like a mirror has become outdated, and curly and disheveled is the most popular style—their faces are sallow, their eyebrows are not drawn—some have shaved off both eyebrows—you would never dream that such a person would be so beautiful and charming in the evening!</p>
<p>After dressing up in the evening, the three-sectioned body lives in the georgette, the chest is towering forward, with a pair of milk peaks, the waist is as thin as a reed, and the lower back protrudes backward with high buttocks. In a long cheongsam, two thick legs are vaguely visible. Some even don't wear socks—if you have scars on your legs, it's better to wear a pair of socks—such a fleshy body can attract the opposite sex to chase after her. Looking at her face again, you can only see a white face, with a bright red mouth in the middle. This is comparable to vanilla ice cream with a red cherry on top. You don't need to appreciate the beauty or ugliness of her face, because if you look closely, it will make you shout out loud.</p>
<p>In the past, what was said above belonged to low-class women, but as the times progressed, ordinary middle-class women also have such a trend. If you don't believe it, you only need to stand at the crossroads every day, and you can always enjoy countless expressions of fleshy women. This doesn't cost money but allows you to feast your eyes on them; then there are those who spend money to watch Russian women's * dances. They are truly the biggest fools in the world!</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the expression of summer! In every park, every morning, there are couples of young people. Some are talking intimately, some are joking, some are flirting, some are holding hands... Almost all the programs that should be in the history of love can be seen.</p>
<p>However, people from another world can also be seen in every park. There are also those who practice Tai Chi, those who read books, those who sit idly, those who run, those who walk idly, and even Chinese maids pushing foreign children's carts, and Chinese women with children in general... In this way, the beautiful park cannot be exclusively occupied by lovers.</p>

<p>Supply and Demand Balance, Minor Fluctuations</p>
<p>The gold market suddenly rebounded yesterday. The morning market was quite stable, and the afternoon market saw less trading and a flat trend. However, foreign telegrams reported that London's spot prices fell slightly, American silver remained unchanged, and exchange rates continued to rise but not by much. The five metals exchange saw a sudden drop in forward silver prices of 7.5 and 3.3 li respectively. Comparing opening and closing prices, the actual drop was more than one fen.

<p>Dalian Agreement Signing Public Bonds Continue to Hit New Highs</p>
<p>96 and Whole 6 Issues Show Particularly Strong Gains</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange remained positive. Amid this high level of optimism, the sudden announcement of the signing of the Dalian Agreement further strengthened market sentiment. The 96 and Whole 6 issues, in particular, showed stronger gains. This is because most people believed that the market price was already high and shorting was more advantageous. However, after settlement, the market price did not decrease and instead rose again, resulting in buying in. This back and forth raised the market price invisibly. This is one reason. During previous similar settlement periods, short squeezes often occurred, even deviating from the environment and leading to uncontrolled price increases, which were often unfavorable to short sellers. This is another reason. Forward premiums favored long positions, while short positions often faced premiums. Therefore, except for those with physical goods, speculators did not dare to attempt shorting easily. However, this does not apply to changes in the current situation. For the 96 issue, excluding the Japanese gold bonds, the actual amount was 48 million. The government previously exchanged these for new bonds, but those that were not exchanged accounted for more than one-third. The remaining majority was accumulated in the financial sector. These were bought at high prices during the 1925 96 crisis, and they cannot be sold at the current market price without exposing the truth. Therefore, the amount circulating in the market is estimated to be only around 10 million. When demand increases, there is a panic of insufficient chips. This is partly because the market price of various bonds is already high, and speculators avoid heavy positions and choose light ones. It is also partly because the surplus of customs revenue is gradually increasing, leading to rumors of consolidation. Unless one only sells when there are many physical goods and only buys when there is surplus capital, one will inevitably enter the whirlpool. Yesterday, market prices increased gradually in each of the two sessions in the morning, with gains of 3 to 4 jiao. The 96 issue gained 6 to 7 jiao. In the two afternoon sessions, highs and lows were mixed. Overall, the market remained firm and stable. Demand for Whole 6 was high, while supply was low. Although the 96 issue was heavily sold by the Northern Group, the buyers were also strong, and the market price remained firm and stable. Buying was mainly focused on the 4th and 16th issues, while selling was mainly from the 11th issue and the Northern Group. As a result, market prices consistently rose by 1 to 2 jiao to around half a yuan. The 96 issue rose by 4.5 to 6.5 jiao, and the Whole 6 issue rose by as much as 8 to 9 jiao. The market prices of various securities mostly hit new highs. The total transaction volume was 14,316,000 yuan, including 6,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures for the 96 issue accounted for the largest share, with a transaction volume of 3.34 million. Salt tax was 2,875,000, consolidated tax and the 20th issue were both 1,835,000, demobilization was 1,375,000, the 19th Customs Surtax was 1.1 million, and the 20th issue was 820,000. The remaining issues ranged from tens of thousands to 340,000.</p>

<p>A report from the Sincere Trading Company stated that on Wednesday (the 5th), the New York stock market initially declined due to profit-taking by long positions. Later, due to good news about railways, railway stocks saw a rebound, and other stocks also stabilized. The total trading volume for the day was 5.8 million shares. Looking at the current trend, it is expected to continue to rise. Wheat continued to suffer damage due to drought, and the market opened strong, but prices fell back due to profit-taking by long positions. It is expected to rise again in the future. American cotton may experience rainfall in the drought-stricken areas of western Texas due to tropical storms heading towards the region. Also, due to difficulties in reducing sterling exchange rates and cotton field work, Liverpool and Southern sellers were very active, and prices fell by about 20 points.

<p>The yarn market is weakening, and prices are falling again. Due to thick inventories and sluggish sales in all areas, although factories have mentioned stopping night shifts, some are deeply concerned that it may be difficult to achieve in reality. As for the situation of overseas cotton industries, weakness has reappeared. In short, the domestic social and economic situation is deteriorating, and farmers are unable to purchase, resulting in an increasing accumulation of yarn in warehouses. In the current situation, optimism is not warranted. It is heard that a certain factory has offered about 10,000 bales of 20-count yarn at a price of 205 yuan for the 9th, 10th, and 11th months.</p>

Transactions in spot yarn were not active, with buyers being scarce, and prices for each month fell by 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4 jiao. The market situation remained weak in the afternoon, and there was profit-taking by long positions, with prices for each month falling by another 3.6, 3.8, and 3.9 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 47,500 bales. Selling was found to be 1,000 bales for Chunji, 1,000 bales for Delong, 2,450 bales for Mingde, 2,150 bales for Senkang, and 1,950 bales for Yuande.

<p>The price of old cotton is rising firmly, and the sound of a short squeeze is imminent. However, the market sentiment for new cotton for distant months is softer due to the influence of declining American cotton prices. Regarding the borrowing of American cotton, according to one piece of information, the first batch of 50,000 bales may arrive in Shanghai around August 10th. However, buyers' intentions remain firm, and the future depends on the situation of American cotton.</p>

<p>The opening price in the Zheng Biao Exchange fell due to the poor performance of foreign cotton, and market sentiment softened, with prices for each month falling by 2.3 and 4 jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a slight turnaround because factories slowed down their selling. Yesterday, in the integrated market, only Fuxin and small to medium-sized factories sold slightly in the afternoon, and the output was also small. Customer demand was slightly more active. This is because the Northern warlords are about to be resolved, and there is hope for future sales. Therefore, some scattered groups inquired, and the Andong group handled sales more actively. Both spot and forward sales were being received, and market sentiment stabilized. This attracted new long positions and short covering transactions, and the market immediately stabilized. Closing prices were large 75 for July and October, large 1.25 for August and September, and large 1 for November and December.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat turned around for all months because new long positions and short covering offset the selling pressure, and market sentiment stabilized. However, the market softened again slightly after a large trader sold in the afternoon. As a result, the large price was 3 fen for July, August, and October, large 1 fen for September, large 4 fen for November, and large 1 fen for December. 20,000 bags of spot wheat continued to arrive. Factories initially planned to continue their defensive stance, but later some traders took them back. Fuxin also handled more than 2,000 bags as a courtesy, with prices opening at 3.65 yuan to 3.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Min and Zhejiang Sales are Very Active...All Types of Rice Are Doing Well</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Min group sold 1,183 bags of Hunan rice, 821 bags of Nanjing and Wuxi rice, and 1,300 bags of small polished rice. The Wentai group sold 206 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice and 1,800 bags of small polished rice. Local street vendors sold 400 bags of Saigon rice and 200 bags of small polished rice. Local customers continued to be active, and market sentiment and market conditions both showed upward momentum. Small polished rice and Hunan Jinjing rice each rose by one jiao. High-quality Xiang Jing rice is already scarce, and medium-quality rice is also scarce. After the Min group searched for it, the market price immediately rose. Small polished rice has been active for several days, and 3,200 bags were offered yesterday, which is an especially good situation. Therefore, all prices rose by one jiao, and the rest showed a turnaround and followed suit.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Lower River Rice is in a Stable Situation <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source is more than thirty numbers, and the market situation is stable. Although sellers unanimously called for price increases, customers were unwilling to buy much due to the hot weather, resulting in a sluggish inventory in urban and rural stores. The market prices of thick japonica rice from the Chang group, Su Tong group, and Nangang, etc., showed no changes. Only Du Yangjian still showed its beauty because it was in short supply and fragrant. The Qingdao and Tianjin groups purchased only 600 to 700 bags of Qingsong Sibo rice, and the market situation was also flat. Looking at the trend near noon, it already showed signs of softening, so it is expected that there will be a price cut in tomorrow's market. Bian Yuan's stable situation changed because the Fuzhou group purchased 200 bags, and the other stomach was also good, and the market price rose by one jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about twenty sources of rice from the Lower River area. The sales of white japonica rice were normal, and the market shape was stable. Early thin rice was in short supply and sold actively, and the price saw a tightening. Sheep tip was slightly soft, Du Bu customer tip was normal, and the source of Bian Yuan was less sold and sluggish, and the market shape was fixed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake factory market was still loose, but there were still 20,000 to 30,000 sales, so the market continued to defend the original market. The factory's recent price cuts were actually due to the abundance of spot goods and the unfavorable conditions of the exchange's fatigue and speculation, resulting in price cuts to seek sales. Although the market has stabilized, market sentiment has already weakened.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea from Luzhuang and Pingshui were both actively traded. British and French merchants were enthusiastically buying needle eyebrow and pearl tea. The arrival of high and medium-grade Zhenmei tea was not large, and transactions were slightly weak, but the selling price remained firm. The green tea market has reached a stable position. Yesterday, Russian firms were still discussing prices for Qimen black tea, and Yihua Baochang and other firms also had scattered replenishments. Moreover, due to the opening of Russian firms, they sent out large amounts of telegrams to promote sales, and the market situation was also better than before. However, the selling price has fallen to the extreme, and the losses suffered by merchants are still huge.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Liberation of the Preface <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zhui</p>
<p>In feudal times, when a person wrote a book, it was "hidden in famous mountains and passed down to the right person." That's all in the past. Now it's been thirty-three years into the twentieth century, and the place is the Shanghai concession. Becoming a comprador brings immediate glory and wealth, so why shouldn't a writer immediately seek fame and fortune? Thus, there is a method.</p>
<p>That method is to first decide that you are a writer and have some inheritance or subsidy. Then, open your own bookstore, run your own magazine, publish your own articles, create your own advertisements, report your own news, and think up your own tricks... But it doesn't work. The liberation of poetry has already been done by someone else, and the liberation of lyrics can only fool birds. Therefore, the "liberation of the preface" arises.</p>
<p>The preface has existed since ancient times, written by others or by the author. But this is too old-fashioned and doesn't suit the taste of the "writer" of the "new era." Because it's difficult to boast in your own preface, and others might not necessarily flatter you, it's only natural to liberate it, which means having yourself write a preface for your own work, calling it "extracting letters," which sounds like adding flowers to brocade. A "collection of good reviews" still needs to be attached at the end, but a substitute preface allows you to see a lot of praise as soon as you open the book, like a famous actor stepping onto the stage and everyone shouting "Bravo!" How interesting. If it were an actor, they would have to buy many gramophones and record themselves shouting "Good!" to play when they go on stage.</p>
<p>But what happens if this kind of trick is exposed? There's a method for that too. Immediately put on a "pitiful" look and say that you have no party affiliation, don't borrow ideologies, and have no gang connections, "never daring to be arrogant," showing none of the head-shaking, tail-wagging, smug air of the "symposium" days. Instead, it seems like others are reactionaries, murderers, arsonists, Qing Gang, Red Gang, bullying this weak and talented young master.</p>
<p>What's even more effective is to say that his attacks are actually because his "ability is weak and unable to meet the demands of friends." If we didn't know the gender of this "writer," we would suspect that many people with party affiliations or gang connections have repeatedly borrowed money from him, or vehemently proposed to her, or something, and were "unable to satisfy" them, thus suffering unjust revenge.</p>
<p>But I hope my words still don't harm the "writer" of the "new era," and I'll "extract" a "good review" to use as a "substitute postscript":</p>
<p>'"Hiding it in famous mountains and passing it down to the right person" is long gone. In the twentieth century, there's a method. The liberation of lyrics, liberate, liberate, add flowers to brocade, how interesting? But others are reactionaries, bullying this weak and talented young master, actually because his "ability is weak and unable to meet the demands of friends," thus suffering unjust revenge, without harming the "writer" of the "new era."'</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Utmost in Kindness of Punishment and Reward <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Muzhai, integrates the new and old, and is well-versed in ancient and modern times, making him worthy of respect and discussion. His discussion of "examination" says that we should learn from ancient methods and understand "punishment and reward." Even if Jia Yi and Dong Zhongshu were resurrected, they could only say so much.</p>
<p>Previous notes said that Emperor Taizong of Tang privately visited and was very pleased to see many successful new scholars (note) displaying their triumphant arrogance, saying, "All the heroes of the world have entered my snare!" The ancient method and meaning of the Chinese examination was originally to "bring all the heroes of the world into my snare." To wear down the youth's heroic ambitions under the lamplight, to gradually tame the wild wolf into a tail-wagging dog: from ancient times to the present, examinations have always emphasized essays and used Confucian classics; even though the Yuan and Qing entered China as barbarians, the power of the eight-legged essay and examination poems did not decline, that is the natural trend!</p>
<p>The great Northern Song writer Su Dongpo said in his famous provincial examination work, "On the Utmost in Kindness of Punishment and Reward," "The former kings knew that the goodness of the world could not be exhausted by rewards, and that titles and stipends were insufficient to encourage them; they knew that the evil of the world could not be exhausted by punishments, and that knives and saws were insufficient to cut them down. Therefore, they raised them and returned them to benevolence, treating the world with the way of gentlemen and elders, causing the world to follow them and return to the way of gentlemen and elders, hence it is said to be the utmost in kindness." The meaning is: it is natural for those with merit to receive high rewards; but there are too many merit dogs, and rewards cannot be exhausted, what should be done? It is also natural for reactionaries to be severely punished; but there are too many reactionaries, and punishments cannot be exhausted, what should be done? The former kings came up with a wonderful method, calling everyone to return to the way of gentlemen and elders, to return to the "benevolence" of the utmost in kindness. "Benevolence" is an abstract term, and when seen in action, a system called "imperial examination" is established. The meaning is: if you want high office and generous pay, then you should take the examination; if you want to take the examination, then you should follow my official procedures; if you follow my official procedures, then you will have to somersault in the sacred scriptures and virtuous biographies all your life; isn't this effect greater than rewarding with high office and generous pay, even though high office and generous pay are not used as a reward? If you don't take the examination, or if you take the examination but don't follow the official procedures, like Zhu Maichen living in poverty, or Su Qin failing the examination, the father doesn't consider him a son, the wife doesn't consider him a husband, the sister-in-law doesn't consider him an uncle, you can only hang yourself or prick your thigh and work hard again; isn't this effect better than punishing with knives and saws, even though knives and saws are not used as punishment? As the saying goes, "Teach your wife when she first comes, teach your child when he's a baby." In youth, first temper and refine, refine a good blank, if it is good, it will be enough to receive a high reward, and if it is bad, it will also avoid flowing into reaction, isn't this the utmost in kindness?</p>
<p>To cure an epidemic, you must use ancient prescriptions: to relieve stomach pain, please eat incense ash, and to treat malaria, you must recite the Gao Huang Sutra. We disciples of the sages can only save the country by reading the sutras! I further declare Su Zi's words to wait for the wind to be gathered by travelers!</p>
<p>(Note) The status of scholars in the Tang Dynasty was noble, slightly similar to that of Jinshi in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.</p>

<p>— Miao Chongqun</p>
<p>After a summer, I returned to Nanjing again; now I am spending my second summer in Nanjing.</p>
<p>When I was away, whenever summer came, the thought of my father's illness, during this season, often evoked my melancholy and unease.</p>
<p>Now, I am still away, but my thoughts have become a blank. Summer has arrived, and my father's face, my father's flesh, my father's white beard, perhaps they will gradually decay and disappear in the coffin, right? It is this time of year.</p>
<p>When I parted with my younger brother, I said:</p>
<p>"Almost everyone who was the same age as our father has died. Now, only our generation is left."</p>
<p>Year after year has passed, and I don't know if my heart has become more lonely or more peaceful.</p>
<p>In the past, I seemed like a post horse, running from east to west, north and south, panting for a long time. Now, I don't know why, I'm dragging myself to whatever station it may be, and I need rest so much. When I arrive, I want to stay; in this one station, I want to rest forever.</p>
<p>This time when I returned to Nanjing, I no longer want to move. Because there is no comfortable place to stay, I simply squat in my wife's house, which is as big as a trough. I originally wanted to hold my breath here for two days, but to my surprise, an old friend whom I hadn't seen for a long time came to visit.</p>
<p>This trough is only so big, and he can only occupy a small army cot as his territory.</p>
<p>On summer nights, I often suffer from insomnia. Every night, after the oil lamp wick is turned low, they both sleep peacefully; and the lamp soon extinguishes itself as if it were tired.</p>
<p>I am restless, I listen attentively, but I can't hear a sound. The night is so dark and silent that I really don't know where I am resting.</p>
<p>An inexplicable restlessness causes an inexplicable itch on my body. An inexplicable itch causes an inexplicable restlessness in my heart.</p>
<p>I determined to strike a match, wanting to tear apart the darkness and silence of the night.</p>
<p>In the momentary light, I saw my old friend sleeping under the old wainscoting, and my wife sleeping beside me. On the white sheet, "Nanjing bugs" as big as pears were scurrying about busily.</p>
<p>The match went out, and the night returned to its darkness and silence.</p>
<p>Things that suck blood are in the dark.</p>
<p>My friend dreamed briefly from time to time.</p>
<p>My wife also dreamed briefly from time to time.</p>
<p>I asked them, but they didn't answer. I thought with horror: there is neither friend nor wife sleeping in this room. They are just two human forms, and they seem to be covered by ghosts.</p>
<p>Night is ghostly.</p>
<p>I still couldn't hear any sound. If the ash of the mosquito coil fell into the dish with a sound, it was heard by me.</p>
<p>I still couldn't see anything. If the little red ember of the mosquito coil was what I saw, then it undoubtedly was also watching the three of us.</p>
<p>I don't know how, I saw two embers of mosquito coils; the ghost seemed to have taken my hand, and I don't know how I got to the next morning.</p>
<p>The next morning, after they both woke up, I asked: "What did you dream about last night?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," they said with a smile, not remembering anything.</p>
<p>"Last night, I don't know why, but I saw two red embers in the mosquito coil dish," I asked, bringing up the mystery of the night.</p>
<p>"That was your illusion," my friend even denied what I saw.</p>
<p>···············</p>
<p>"For many years, friends like old friends have not increased."</p>
<p>My friend suddenly thought of such a sentence.</p>
<p>I was silent, thinking of what I said when I parted with my younger brother this time, and wanted to add:</p>
<p>"Our generation is also withering away as we watch."</p>

<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>"So, what to do?" Yongsun asked.</p>
<p>"They say they want to use the Changzhen Construction Company's name to provide relief to Zhabei."</p>
<p>The crowd seemed stunned to hear this. Yongsun sat up from the couch, propped himself up with his hands on the edge of the couch, and asked Botang with a puzzled expression:</p>
<p>Has the factory ever provided any relief before?</p>
<p>"The first time," Botang said, "they donated two hundred yuan in the name of consolation... The second time, they donated four hundred yuan worth of medicines and thirty bunk beds to the Red Cross. Last Wednesday, they also lent a truck used to transport materials to the local maintenance association to use."</p>
<p>"Then..." Yongsun drawled out the words, "Then... it can be considered that they have fulfilled some obligations... The matter... now... what should I say... to be good?... "</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Yongsun, who raised a hand and scratched his head for a while, and finally said:</p>
<p>"Botang, since they are coming tomorrow morning, let's talk about it again tomorrow morning!" At this time, the maid came in again:</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang called, young master, and asked me to ask if the young master will be at the mansion tomorrow morning?"</p>
<p>"Which Mr. Zhang?" Botang asked.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang Ziyu, the person in charge of the factory. He said that he can't come out tonight without a notification."</p>
<p>Bokang did not answer, but stood up, walked out of the room, and went to the telephone to talk.</p>
<p>When he returned to the room, he saw that Yongsun had already put on his coat.</p>
<p>"Is Father leaving?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm leaving," Yongsun said, and then asked, "Does Zhiguang know about the factory's situation?"</p>
<p>"He knows a little bit, but not very clearly. He just got the information... Now, he will go to the factory early tomorrow morning and then come back..."</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>"Is Father coming back to stay here today?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not. There are many people staying here with you. If I don't come, I can take up one less bed, and everyone will be a little more comfortable!"</p>
<p>After Yongsun finished speaking, he looked at those who were taking refuge in Botang's house with a subtle smile. Botang asked:</p>
<p>"Where should we meet Father tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Yongsun thought for a while before saying:</p>
<p>"Listen for my call. It's really hard to say now... As for the factory's affairs, you can decide for yourself."</p>
<p>So he slowly left the door of this house, and the shadows of the people in the house followed him out one by one.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Eight or nine hours later, the weak gray light of dawn had slowly pierced the layer of thin mist covering the ten-mile foreign concession. At this time, the sound of artillery in the vicinity, as if following the usual practice of the past ten days or so, had stopped early as soon as it dawned. Although the sound of artillery in the distance was still faintly carried over by the northeast wind, it seemed that everyone in the foreign concession had forgotten at this time that they were lying behind the realistic battlefield around Zhabei: those who were fast asleep and had not woken up were still extending the sweet taste of last night, those who were using physical strength or power to move on the ground were busy with their daily lives, but those who opened their eyes and were on the bed or sitting on chairs were, at most, taking the daily newspaper published in the morning and shaking their heads and sighing!</p>
<p>However, what on earth was Yao Botang doing at this time?</p>

<h3 id="e224">Today's Men of Letters <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ben</p>
<p>In the past, in China, men of letters valued integrity very much. From the saying "A scholar can be killed but not humiliated," it can be known that ordinary men of letters generally had to maintain a certain amount of self-respect. For example, Li Taibai, such an uninhibited man of letters, his letter to Han Jingzhou was very solemn in attitude, neither arrogant nor humble, and the lines revealed a tough backbone of a man of letters. Ordinary men of letters were deeply influenced by the ancient sages' "learning leads to officialdom" and tempted by the feudal environment where men of letters had to enter officialdom, so of course everyone wanted to be an official, and everyone regarded being an official as the proper way out for a man of letters, but if they couldn't get it or were not satisfied with it, they would simply retreat to the countryside. Tao Qian is a good example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when it comes to the relationship between men of letters, although there were divisions of factions and struggles between parties, they still paid attention to integrity. They encouraged each other's learning and conduct and rarely blindly praised each other or blindly attacked each other. It was even rarer for them to be as close as a ball of sealing wax for a short period of time, and then suddenly scold each other like village women, exhibiting all kinds of ugly behavior.</p>
<p>This, I think, is a common feeling shared by anyone who has read literary history or has a slight acquaintance with ancient literary works. I believe it is not something the author fabricates out of thin air.</p>
<p>History has evolved, and times have changed. When it comes to today's capitalist society, the bones and blood of men of letters seem to have changed their source. Integrity has been swept away, so it has provoked ordinary "indignant at the world and resentful of customs" moralistic elders to sigh in a long voice: "The world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not as they used to be." In fact, society is constantly evolving. "The past" is not necessary. It is only "the world is deteriorating" and integrity is almost wiped out that is definitely not the phenomenon that the evolution of men of letters should have. It has led even children like the author to shout "It is worthy of a long sigh."</p>
<p>Today's men of letters, their desire to become officials is probably a thousand times stronger than that of the ancients, because there is a general situation of "more monks than congee" now. A man of letters relies entirely on the knowledge in his head. If he wants to squeeze in, it is simply not possible. Moreover, since the method of seeking officialdom by "singing praises and praising virtues" is no longer popular today, they have come up with wonderful ideas and further play the trick of auctioning off their souls. Thus, there are men of letters who were formerly proletarian writers who can transform themselves and grandly become county magistrates, and former ×× party members who are bought off and become supervisory officials in a matter of moments. This kind of person is numerous.</p>
<p>When men of letters get to this point, integrity has already disappeared.</p>
<p>And among men of letters, there is even more fickleness. If you are close to me today, I will blindly praise you. Tomorrow, I can regard you as an enemy, attacking you with all my strength. Forming alliances and cooperating one day, tearing down the platform and fighting the next. Switching sides is common, and all kinds of ugly behavior are displayed.</p>
<p>The tricks of today's men of letters are nothing more than this!</p>
<p>Facts tell us that the intellectual class has reached a period of decline, approaching the realm of the tomb. They do not talk about integrity at all, and are simply shameless. Perhaps it is the afterglow of the setting sun, the last scene of ugly struggle before death!</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>It has been so slow in coming. I have not seen a single red peach or green willow in the atmosphere of the city, nor has a yellow oriole played with its tongue in front of my window; but the gentle breeze of early summer has already descended on the small building.</p>
<p>When I got up in the morning, I felt inexplicably uncomfortable all over. Without breakfast, I went to Avenue Joffre for a walk alone. Avenue Joffre and I were as intimate as old friends. When I stepped from books into society, for a full three years, my life was entrusted to Avenue Joffre. Now, due to environmental reasons, I moved from that romantic embrace into a narrow small building. When I return to Avenue Joffre, my spirit is uplifted. The shops that seemed familiar have been replaced with new posters; in just one year, only the small trees on the roadside are still fluttering in the morning breeze, but they have also grown a lot.</p>
<p>It was still early. The clear sky, the street cleaners dragging garbage trucks, walking slowly with their heads down, as if they were in a fairyland. I counted the squares of the sidewalk and floated along. My steps were so slow, and I was whistling a popular song about a lover in my dream, walking without knowing why. In the distance, a young woman in a white silk dress was pushing a baby carriage towards me. She was leisurely and lightly tilting her head, as if teasing her little darling. A smile slipped from the corner of her mouth, and her temples were flying in the morning breeze.</p>
<p>We met face to face in front of a beautiful window display. With a familiar outline, I avoided her gaze and brushed past her, but I didn't want to walk far, so I secretly turned my eyes back. She was leaning back on the back of the carriage with both hands, watching my back.</p>
<p>"Miss Ling," rolled in my throat.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhang, is that you!" She jumped over, dragging the baby carriage.</p>
<p>"Although your face is familiar, I don't recognize you."</p>
<p>A smile slipped from the corner of her mouth, and her temples were flying in the morning breeze.</p>
<p>"Still at the Russian woman's house?"</p>
<p>"No, just walking around."</p>
<p>"Going to the French Park?"</p>
<p>I pushed the baby carriage, and the child smiled at me.</p>
<p>"Is this yours?"</p>
<p>She nodded, and a virgin's blush appeared on her cheeks.</p>
<p>When I lived in the Russian woman's house, I met Miss Ling. She was still a mischievous child of fifteen, eating chocolate and playing with a ball. Because I was a lonely person, I was very happy to have an innocent companion. One day, in the French Park, I inadvertently asked her: "Do you want to study?" She said she didn't have any money, so I agreed to teach her. From the next day, she came to my residence to study every night.</p>
<p>In summer, we met in the French Park in the morning, and teaching was also changed to that time, in the thatched pavilion at the entrance. Because I also worked at a night club at night.</p>
<p>Miss Ling was very smart, and she could already distinguish the use of I and Me. Also on a sunny day, before teaching, she asked me what the pronunciation of "love" was. "Love," I said.</p>

<p>Wu Hufan, alias Chouyi, is the grandson of the Prime Minister of Kezhai. He inherited the family's learning early and had already established an outstanding reputation in his youth. The literati and officials in Wuzhong all liked to make friends with him, but his theory of painting was not based on the old ways. His brushwork could create a painting even when upside down and in disarray. His intelligence was so supreme that it was beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>
<p>"For example, I love you is I Love you, and you love me is You Love Me."</p>
<p>"Correct."</p>
<p>She smiled, and a virgin's blush appeared on her cheeks. We pushed the car, side by side, and entered the gate of the French Park. I looked up and saw a middle-aged man teaching a girl to read in the thatched pavilion.</p>
<p>We walked slowly, floating along, under the trees, by the river, sadly reminiscing.</p>
<p>She is now someone else's wife, a child's mother, no longer eating chocolate or playing with a ball; even less can I hear her say "Love You, You Love Me."</p>
<p>We walked slowly, floating along, under the trees, by the river, sadly reminiscing.</p>

<p>What is the purpose of life?</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I have a question, namely, "What is the purpose of life?" I previously read Liang Rengong's posthumous work, which had an essay on this topic; but it never answered the ultimate question, and I have been doubtful ever since. I am shallow and unlearned, and I dare not make reckless comments. Now, thanks to my two friends, Ye and Wei, who do not abandon my ignorance, they have answered for me, saying, "The purpose of life is, in the final analysis, to eat." The two gentlemen also cited Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, which emphasizes people's livelihood, and the Principle of People's Livelihood has a special section on the issue of eating, arguing vigorously to the extreme. The two gentlemen cited the current economic panic, social crisis, and unemployment problems, all of which are directly or indirectly related to the issue of eating, as evidence. A difficult problem that has not been resolved for more than ten years has been solved by the two gentlemen, how happy! However, when I think about it in the quiet of the night, it seems that their words are not exhaustive, so I respectfully send this letter to you for instruction, and I would be extremely grateful if you would give me final guidance. I respectfully wish you</p>
<h3 id="e228">Peace, Liu Xingchuan respectfully <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The purpose of life is simply the word "live." Even ants greedily cling to life, let alone humans. Within the meaning of this word "live," there are two elements: 1. How to be able to live, and 2. How to live meaningfully. Those who have no way to solve the first problem have no time and should not bother with the second problem. However, once you have solved the first problem, you cannot but attempt to take the second step. Because if you don't, you will lose the original driving force of life. If the first problem is not solved, you will inevitably be forced to commit suicide; if the second problem is not solved, you will become tired of the world; although the forms are different, they both result in the inability to survive. Before the material competition was eased, of course, some people said, "The purpose of life is to establish merit and achieve success"; in this era of sharpened survival competition, it is certainly possible to say, "The purpose of life is to eat." However, society is unequal. When it is not a problem for the masses to eat, it is hard to guarantee that there will not be a minority who have no way to make a living; similarly, in the current situation where the lives of the masses cannot be maintained, there are also a very small number of bourgeoisie. Therefore, we still believe that the purpose of life is the word "live"; "how to be able to live" and "how to live meaningfully" are both indispensable.</p>

<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>"Aren't you going?" Third Mistress Tai shouted.</p>
<p>"But, I haven't eaten yet?" He wanted to use this reason to decline.</p>
<p>"I was just thinking of having some refreshments, so I'll accompany you to a Western restaurant nearby!" Third Mistress Tai pressed him so tightly, the pride of a woman made her determined to take him away from Meizi's side.</p>
<p>Then, she deliberately affectionately took Shi Qiao's arm. And so, they walked slowly side by side towards the garden, like a young couple.</p>
<p>"That landlady is a Japanese woman, aren't you the most hateful of Japanese people?" Third Mistress said in a low voice, "Hey, one can imagine that what you say about patriotism is also fake."</p>
<p>Of course, there was no need for him to argue with such shallow and childish words, and the more important problem was that he didn't have a penny to eat at the Western restaurant. Of course, Third Mistress Tai wouldn't think of this, and continued, "The Japanese are, after all, not easy to mess with! Moreover, the Russians are staying in the house all day long!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Why don't you say a word? Are you angry?" ││ "Have I been bad to you in any way? Tell me, tell me!"</p>
<p>Treating him to meals, accompanying him to dances, and letting him... of course, she was good to him. How could he answer this?</p>
<p>Fortunately, on the other side of the pavement, Wang Hua was walking towards him with someone else. From far away, he shouted:</p>
<p>"Shi Qiao, Shi Qiao! Where are you going, where are you going?"</p>
<p>When they got close, the person who came with him was Hu Yuanliang, a tall, skinny man, and Shi Qiao hadn't seen him for a long time. Wang Hua had changed into a very neat Western suit, and even his hair was combed slickly. Although he wasn't handsome enough to be called a pretty boy, he was a typical little swindler. He secretly whispered to Shi Qiao:</p>
<p>"Please introduce me!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, this is Mr. Wang Hua, and this is Mr. Hu Yuanliang." Shi Qiao then pointed to Third Mistress Tai: "This is Miss, Miss Li!"</p>
<p>"Oh, so you are from the same family! Excellent, excellent." These words were of course said by Wang Hua. Then he leaned closer to Shi Qiao's ear:</p>
<p>"Hello, hello!" │ "Look, we are going to start formal activities. Look, I specially borrowed a suit to wear today. You should always dress nicely when you are active. The most taboo is to look poor! Yuanliang completely agrees with our affairs, Yuanliang!"</p>
<p>The tall, skinny man had to come up and exchange a few pleasantries with Shi Qiao.</p>
<p>"We'll come to your house again tonight! Goodbye. Miss Li!"</p>
<p>Wang the dwarf led Hu the skinny and bowed respectfully.</p>
