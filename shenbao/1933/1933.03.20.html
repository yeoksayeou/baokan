<p>第二次大戰之方式將爲帝國主義間之衝突而非爲帝國主義聨合一致反蘇聨之鬥爭而帝國主義間衝突之開始國家主義素稱發達之歐洲將爲其導火線已早爲識者所預見數月間歐洲大陸形勢發展之結果更已完全證明此種判斷之正確歐陸之反蘇戰線原以法國爲中心以小協約國爲爪牙英蘇之間雖曾屢次發生衝突終以英國政權之迭更與英法兩雄不並立之關係英人對於蘇俄之政策始終處於若即若離忽分忽合之狀態而意德則因仇法之故本常與蘇聨維持友好之邦交至輓近形勢之轉變則猶始於德國巴本執政之時當其時也國社黨雖未取得政權然已具有不可侮之勢力巴本爲取得國民同情及示好於國社黨計曾公然提出軍備平等之要求德國國家主義之運動旣日趨激烈意大利之聲勢復咄咄逼人法人感於患生肘腋之間不得不移轉目光對付意德法國與小協約國遂相率與蘇聨訂立不侵犯條約所謂反蘇聨戰線於此而烟消雲散矣</p>

<p>（德國通訊）黄公安</p>
<p>新内閣之新人物</p>
<p>德國於昨天（星期一日、即一九三三年元月三十日）在興登堡大總統之指令下、又有一次新内閣之產生、國家社會勞働黨或稱德國法西斯黨之領袖希拉忒、被任爲新内閣總理、前曾兩次退職之舊内閣總理巴本、亦東山再起、被任爲副内閣總理兼普魯士邦政府特任委員長、其餘閣員人物、分配如下、</p>
<p>外交總長　耐辣、</p>
<p>内政總長　輔力騎博士、</p>
<p>國防總長　布林白上將、、</p>
<p>財政總長　哥魯士基爵士、</p>
<p>經濟糧食兼農業總長何堅白博士、</p>
<p>勞工總長　書魯齊、</p>
<p>郵政兼交通總長　李邊德</p>
<p>航空部長　基麟、</p>
<p>司法總長　（未定）</p>
<p>此次新内閣之組織、及其閣員部位之分配、除外交總長耐辣氏係屬舊任閣員外其餘皆係初登政治舞台之新脚色、並俱屬由法西斯國家主義運動出身的極端右傾分子、左派如社會民主黨及共產黨、溫和集團之中央黨皆被排斥、或謂不願與右派合作、均無代表參與此次組閣、社會民主黨前進日報以社會的眼光批評此次閣員人物、略謂彼等皆係代表大資本家、大工業階級、大地主、封建思想及法西斯清一色右派聨合戰綫之反動勢力、此外再就一般通普之輿論觀之、大抵公認此次新内閣爲希拉忒巴本及何堅白右派之三頭内閣、此黨係中立客觀的不偏之論也、</p>
<h3 id="c103">新内閣成立之經過 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>德國此次新内閣成立之經過、其程序甚屬簡單、所費時間亦比較往常爲短而興登堡總統此次亦運用政治的手腕、以快刀斬亂麻之神速方法、毅然批准斯萊爾舊内閣辭職、並立列斷定召希拉忒組閣實係驚人偉績、此次閣潮之經過、旣未有惹起政治之不安、亦無社會任何重大騒擾之激發、一帆風順安然過去、此誠德國閣潮變換中罕有之現象、舊内總理斯萊爾、於元月杪、因新國會不能組成多數政府人員爲之憤悶與失望、加以國會左右兩極端黨、對斯氏亦不子以信任同情、他方面因斯氏自就任内閣以來、所持各種救濟經恐慌及失業問題之政策、過於消極、而其本人政治之方向、又無决絕之明顯表示、内閣處於被動的政治立塲、以致大喪社會有力之後盾、與政黨之同情、孤軍奮鬥、獨力難持、結果遂致一籌莫展、而其所謂助東計劃（此即救濟東普魯士農民之計劃）無充分完滿積極之有效設計、尤其使東普圵地主與農民之不滿、從而引起對斯氏之攻擊與倒閣運動、此外聞斯氏與興登堡公子意見不和、環境惡劣、四面受敵、使斯内閣亦極難爲情、最後因斯氏曾向興登堡提議再行解散國會案不予允納、由是氏之政策愈形失意、不得不於元月二十九向興登堡提出内閣總辭職、興登堡接到斯氏辭職書後、鑑於斯氏内閣之無能爲力、當然不能再令其久留貽誤時機、興氏遂立予批准、從此斯萊爾内閣總理之籌命、祇得七十五日而告終、自此閣潮產生後、久在蠢蠢欲動之法西斯黨、乘此時機大作宣傳、一致擁戴法西斯黨領袖希拉忒上塲執政、興登保於此時環顧國内情勢、心目中捨希氏外亦無相黨繼任内閣之人材、興氏雖明知希拉忒會一度與已競選總統、互相爭雄、事實上本係政敵、似無合作或聽命之可能、但興登堡總統目擊内而經濟恐慌痛苦日甚、失業問題日趨嚴重與惡化、左傾無產階級革命的呼聲與事實、又如狂風怒號、與日俱進、外而國際地位之應爭平、等戰債問題、及凡爾賽條約之束縳等、然法西斯黨年來正爲此種内政與外交作最大之努力解放運動、故興登堡爲整個國家圖强計、爲全體民族謀福利計、不得不放棄前嫌、變更策略開誠布公、另立信心、願與希氏携手合謀解决德國目前之緊張政局、先是興登堡授命舊前内閣總理巴本氏、出而與右派首領希何等協商、當時興登堡並提出下列合作條件、</p>
<p>（一）請求希拉忒出任内閣總理、但以放棄從前個人獨裁之主張爲前題、</p>
<p>（二）要求組織國家政府、普容納與德國國民黨首領何堅白及巴本合作、</p>
<p>（三）今後内閣政策、當以放棄法西斯黨之各種經濟制度新試騐、而以切合全國大多數國民之志願、及在於不違背维瑪憲法的精神及原則的條件之下、施行各種新政、</p>
<p>此種協商條件、希氏表示諒解及願容納由是希氏在元月三十日、被任爲新内閣總理、使德國政局由是開一純然右傾之新趨勢、同時亦即爲德國法西斯黨開一首次揷足德國政治舞台的光榮歷史、從而希氏十四年來奔走呼號、千辛萬苦、艱難締造之愛國運動、及其政爭之企圖、亦可謂已達第一步之目的、今復希氏可在實際上一現其政治手段矣、</p>
<h3 id="c104">國内外輿論之回照０ <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>（一）國内輿論之影饗</p>
<p>自希何巴三頭新内閣明令正式公佈後、凡立於右派戰綫之政黨及報紙不用說、當然是表示萬分高興與得意、爲右派政治得勢而恭祝尤其是德國法西斯黨員、自其領袖被任新内閣後、興高彩烈、如醉如狂全國各地會員、立即召集臨時大會大舉慶祝與游行黨員皆穿着軍服、横行直衝於廣塲大道、喜形於色似作無限光榮、並即通電表示一致擁護新内閣、以一千二百萬法西斯黨員、誓爲希氏内閣後　、</p>
<p>但自左派方面觀之、如此　民主黨、鐵的戰線、自由職工會　　產黨等、認爲此次三頭内閣之產生、即爲大資本家、大地主、封建遺老士紳階級武人軍閥法西斯獨裁政治、總　而言之、就是右派檄持（戰線）反動勢力聨合之大成功、此種反動集團向以反對工人利益、鼓吹資本主義、提倡帝國主義政策、實行獨裁、摧殘民治、違反憲法爲號召、今日一旦躍進政治舞台、操縱國家勢力、必予左派以不利之威脅或致命之壓迫、故左派戰線爲維護本身之生存、及工人無產階級之利益計、惟有一致堅决積極表示反對希氏新内閣共產黨報紅旗、及社會民主黨報之前進、立即發表反對新内閣之激烈及强有力之攻擊宣言、並要求左派戰線工人舉行全國同盟總罷工、以實際的行動予新政府及興登堡以一嚴重之警告云云、站於完全中立之報紙、大抵以爲此次新内閣之產生、爲興登堡與希拉忒協調之最好象徵、同時亦即爲右派妥協合作與精誠團結、共謀抵抗左傾勢力之最後成功、國民在站於超黨派之立塲上而民國家福利總體爲前提、量衡此次新閣會、誠可引爲幸事、此種意見吾人可在德國公報見之、惟中央黨此次對於希氏内閣旣不願參與合作亦不表示反對、持容認爲政策、希氏曾以司法總長地位留待中央黨人、中央黨亦不願接納而加以拒絕、態度超然大有衆人皆醉我獨醒之慨此實令人極難索解、不知彼之悶胡蘆中賣什麽藥、</p>
<p>（二）國外輿論之反響</p>
<p>此次德國希氏新内閣出現後、在國外引起最有意味之影響則在羅馬、羅馬方面自得到德國希氏上塲組閣消息後、以爲鄰國多一法西斯獨裁同志之出現、意相莫索里尼表示莫大快慰、意大利全國輿論皆對德新政府宣揚好感、但法國之觀感適與意大利相反、巴黎右派報紙、自接到德匣法西斯希拉忒上台組閣特電後、不覺神魂顚倒徬徨萬分、精神上皆受莫大之打擊與危險之威脅、希氏雖没有對法復仇挑戰之發動、但法則已覺安全問題之嚴重、法之右派分子、因是遂又極力要求政府增加國防預算、德法關係一時又現非常吃緊之勢、莫斯科政府之不願德國右派執政亦與法國相同、蓋法西斯國家主義與斯爾札維亞之國際主義根本爲水火不能相容之物、莫斯科深知此後德國共產黨同志之活動、不受禁制或束縳、故深致不滿之意、英美兩國近年對德稍形接近、彼此國際間旣少歧視之見、亦乏危險之嫌、故不論德國政治如何變幻、直接上與英美不會發生重大影響、所以此次倫敦及紐約方面、對於德國新内閣產生之批評與觀察、態度十分客觀旣不若法國之徬徨、亦不像蘇俄之仇視、英美唯一最大及急進的斯望、就是在於德國自已能够眞正團結、並制裁左傾之尖化、及速謀解决經濟恐慌問題、恢復國際貿易上之常態、庶幾英美亦可少受世界經濟恐慌之累、故甚引以爲幸也瑞士輿論亦與前述各國同、皆具特殊獨有之眼光、如瑞士兩大執紙認爲此次希氏執政、即爲德國法西斯獨裁政治抬頭、及議會民主主義没落之最好象徵（未完）</p>

<p>東北系統下之軍政人員、自張下野以後、多露去志、辭職文電、紛至迭來、軍事領袖萬福麟·王樹常·榮臻·王以哲·沈鴻烈·鮑毓麟等、均經一度辭職政治方面之要人、周大文等亦表示求去、蔣何以在此國難期間仍勉以一致努力、共濟時艱、除蔣張在保商定將東北軍改編四軍、分任　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一二三四軍長外、餘均懇节慰留、絕不更調、一度擬定之平津衛戍司令徐庭瑶、北平市長黄郛、無形打銷、東北軍政人員、以張雖下野、統理有人、在此難關、亦均以國家爲重、當繼續努力、俟將此難危時期渡過再作計較蔣間在石會見結果圓滿、察境國防與治安、商由晉綏軍隊、負責担任、傳作義王靖國各部、已入察境、防務鞏固、原擬以綏遠主席傳作義調主察省、另以王靖國主綏、近以外侮日亟、救亡不遑、内部不宜多所更張、以免減少對外力量、此項擬議、亦不得不暫行擱置矣蔣之對馮、甚望其能到保一談、共商大計、李烈鈞　命到張謁馮、傳達蔣意、促速南下、惟馮、對蔣之懇切相邀、唯唯否否、尙無離張之準備、大約不欲輕離察省一步、以實行其個人最近抗日主張、願在前線與敵一拚也、</p>

<p>（中國的病在那裏）的問題</p>
<p>復江陰濮秉鈞南京柏超雨兩君來訊答：我們因爲客復沈祖光君的來信，討論（中國病在那裏？）的問題，引起了讀者如江陰的濮秉鈞和南京的柏超兩君的責難，兩君以爲我們不應當只指責沈君的說話不對，而應當（站在顧問的立塲上予沈君以誠懇的解答）柏，超君說得更熱烈，以爲我們的辯論都是些（不關痛癢不着邊際與題目驢唇不對馬嘴的惡辯，眞是司笑，可驚，柏君這樣聲色俱厲，甚至帶有一點恐怖的情緒，我們並不怪柏君，不但不怪，並且覺得柏君這樣的讀者若果再多一些，那便是我們的讀者顧問）已經在讀者大衆之中發生了很大的影響，已經引起讀者很大的注意，本攔記者縱或眞（可驚），就死在九泉也當瞑目。不過任憑柏君怎樣高喊着（驚）呀，（笑）呀，然而我們的顧問的天職還是要盡的，所謂（一息尙存，此志不容稍懈）。我們答復沈君的態度雖然有時過於嚴重，然而却不能說不誠懇，恰恰相反，惟其是十分誠懇，才不知不覺地表示着嚴厲的態度。（中國的病在那裏）這個問題雖然是本欄編輯先生代替沈君來信與我們的答復所下的標題，實則這個標題正是沈君來信所討論的根本問題，並不如柏君所說，眞是（驢唇不對馬嘴）這是一。我們答復沈君的來信專門指摘沈君的不是，也不是我們生性（好辯）或是（舞文弄墨），乃是我們讀者顧問的一種答問的方式，也可以說，是富有引人入勝的啓發式的帶有敎育意味的辯論方式。記得歐洲一個有名哲學家，一位比較青年的大學敎授（這在歐洲差不多是例外），他雖然（也是新康德的唯心論的學者，改良主義家，他却在歐洲時，曾經激烈地反對過戰爭。他的信徒很多，也有一種組織。有一次他們開年會，這位大學敎授作報告後，遂令到會各會員各發問題，他對於提出問題者，總是先不答復，極力地並且是無情地窮追發問者對於他所提出之問題的意見，必待發問者對於某問題的意見（理屈詞窮），（精疲力竭）没有一黠可以閃躱的餘地，然後他才徐徐地發表他的意見，聽衆没有不渙然冰釋，如飲甘露的。有時會員被他窮追，無詞可答，甚至繼之以哭泣，然而他絕不因此種情景而中止其問難或改變這種窮追的態度。這又好比研究數理，一個數學難題來了，馬上就去問敎員，敎員馬上告訴他演算的方式，那他一定對於這個難的解釋的公式不會深切地了解，必須待他用過一番心思，想了種種方法，都是（此路不通）之後，再經敎者加以指點，他便會豁然貫通。而且他以前的一番苦思正是他現在豁然貫通之必經的過程；没有以前的苦思絕不會有以後的豁然貫通。記者不肖，竊取斯意以與讀者周旋，（予豈好辯哉？予不得已也。）這是二。沈君來信對於國家政治的見解完全爲現在一般腐敗的學說所漫淫，成見極深，就是說，若不把他窮追到（他無地自容），（無辭以對），並承認自已的錯誤以後，我們對於問題的正面的解釋，他是不會了解，不會接受的。區區苦心，或一時不爲親愛的讀者所原諒，然終久必爲大衆所了解，此則所敢自信者也。這是三。而且有許多問題，在辯論過程中，我們就可看見彼此對於此一問題的根本見解，不待答者正式地答復，才見发曉。說到這裏我們還要討論讀者大衆的意見，然後才發表。們自已的意見，或則到了那時，只須把我們所辯論的，做個結論便得了。現在我們且先研究柏君對於（中國的病在那裏？）的診斷若何？柏君說：（究竟中國的病在那裏，我可以作一個最簡單而最明白的解答，那就是在四萬萬人心中的一轉念間。）一這就是說中國的病就在於四萬萬的人心没有一轉念。）那我們到要請問柏君：中國的四萬萬人心爲甚麽就没有這（一轉念）呢？誰使他們没有這一轉念呢？是上帝呢那我們就勸大衆到禮拜堂裏去禱告好了丨這是不能解决問題的。牠們都是在唯心論雲霧中翻筋斗，確實是一樣的。怎樣不轉念中國便就得救了？爲甚麽四萬萬人就不能大家齊起心來（一轉念）呢？這裏有甚麽（呼風喚雨）（撒豆成兵）的神秘没有呢？若是没有的話，請問在甚麽地方？若是没有的話，那我們還是要追求這種使我們四萬人不能（轉念頭）的（社會原因）與牠的物質原因，即經濟的原因。若果這種上天下地的幻想丨一轉念的念頭不根本取消，我們就告訴你們說中國病在那裏，你也不會相信。即使退一萬步，承認你這話有相當的理由，然而也只說的是中國的病象，而没有看到中國的病根。這是四。其實柏君無意識地已經說出了中國的病根，柏君不是說：（現在中國到甚麽時期了，外侮日急，内政不修，雖然政治當局的意見暫時爲國難而合作但究竟能不能合作到底呢？加以天災人禍帝國主義的深入，農村經濟破產，敎育，政治，尤其是財政，何止千瘡百孔！）？這都不是（病）麽？誰人能否認這都不是中國的病呢？但我們旣然要治病，就不能頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，必定要追求牠的病根在甚麽地方，然後用（打蛇打七寸）的辦法去做根本治療的企圖才庶幾乎有效。柏君說了這一些病狀，究竟誰是主病，誰是從病，誰是心腹之病，誰是癬疥之疾呢？自然柏君是未暇深思的。然而我們從柏君這一段中國病狀診斷書中，已經找出了一半近於病源的話，就是（帝國主義的深入，農村經濟的破產），所謂帝國主義，就是國際資本主義的金融資本勢力之最後的階段的政治形式，中國農村破產，便是這種帝國主義的勢力侵入的結果：我們要想膫然於這種病根所在，一定要：（一）研究國際的經濟政治與中國的經濟政治的關係：（二）研究資本主義的先進國家的統治者在歷史上的成績與殖民地的統治者在現代的命運與其行動之物質的原因，（三）國際平民或貧民大衆之奮鬥的歷史與其遠景。若果大家能耐心對於這三件事有了相當的研究，那他對於中國的問題，國際的問題的觀察，一定會與現在這種（圄圇呑棗）的觀念不同。到了那時，你再來觀察中國的現象，許多從前你以爲奇怪的事，現在都覺得到牠是一種歷史的必然了，也就都找到牠的解答了。譬如，國際聨盟萬不能解决中日的糾紛不但不能解决中日的糾紛，我們老早就大聲疾呼地說了，然而那時大家都是置若岡聞的，現在怎樣呢？不是處處都證實了我們的（幸而得中），實則，只要你肯平心靜氣照着我們前面所指的三種方法去研究，一定都會得出這樣的結論的。這是五。柏君的觀念實在太不清楚了，要商椎的地方還多，然而即此而論，不覺已經一大篇了，就此中止，以後再談罷</p>

<p>春秋血賬  孫文瀾　　兩　個人在屋裏打了一陣架，當然，肉體和物質上，各有相當的損壤；然而比較起來，終是主人家吃虧！如果在打得歇手的時候，那個外人就不聲不響的跑了，這也就没法奈何他：設或他倒要反過來向主人討債肉體上的損失，這可的確是最滑稽的一回事。據日本通訊說：他們國内現在有位内籐順太郎，發表了一篇滿蒙（血）的清算的著作；這可是荒天下之大唐的算倒賬。本來，日本人攻佔了東三省，簡直是一個流氓，　進了人家的大門，在一家人（不抵抗）之下，就把一間客堂喪打得一塌糊塗，强認做自已的東西。然而這時候自已可又不留心，絆了門檻！或踏空台階，跌得個頭破（血）流。他旣然不賠人家的損失，還倒向人家訛詐，要算這一筆（？）的（血）賬。我想内籐顧太郎，眞不愧是日本的國民；思想畢竟也周密些？所以有這一部滿蒙血的清算的著作，來輔助他們政府所想不到。好罷！（有賬好算），這是誰也不會吃虧的事。我們東北人民的的生命，財產，以及國家的軍火，飛機，戰士，等等，那一様不是犠牲在他們！日本的手裏：旣然是要談算賬的話，就是除去了我們應該賠他（？）的（血）的代價外，再呌他另行找補我們四萬萬兩，還怕不夠？朋友們，緊記着呀！這一筆無量數的損失賬，還理當得我們努力去向他算還！賽球  庸子　　錦標誰屬？　　自　從一九一四年到一九一八年，德意志隊同聨合隊大賽足球之後，一直到一九三一年的上半年，除了不零不頭的幾次毫無精彩的友誼賽之外，咱們這些殺人不怕血腥氣的球迷們，好久未有看見正式球賽了。眞幸福，一九三一年的下半年，日本隊在東北運動塲，摩拳擦掌的，向中華隊挑戰。論理，這一次比賽，應當大有可觀，不料中華隊眞不濟，一上場就只守不攻，球兒老是在中華隊球門口打轉，而守門大將，又不肯放些精神出來，球屢次打二條腿縫裏滾進球門，造成一面倒的局勢。現在雖還没有比賽完畢，看來中華隊總没有奪取香檳的希望了。好消息傳來說·從前爲聨合隊戰敗的德意志隊，心不甘服，這幾天非常之活躍。很想重振旗鼓，向聨合隊下戰書，再行一决勝負。查上次德意志隊的球術，高妙得遠在聨合隊之上。開球之後，德意志隊一帆風順，大有直搗黄龍之槪。聨合隊見不是路，於是拉着阿美哥守門，頓時軍威大振，反守爲政，轉敗爲勝。把香檳從德意志隊手裏搶回来。德意志隊是世界有名的球隊，聨合隊又是上次奪得香檳的盟主，假使这二隊有意再在歐洲運動塲比賽一下，不言可知，要比日本隊與中華隊的比賽有精彩得多咧。而且二方面都養情蓄銳了許久，準會有不知新奇到如何程度的表演，博得觀衆們的讚許，而歎爲觀止。東北運動塲的比賽，已成尾聲，歐洲運動塲上，尙未開球，球迷們，請耐着性兒　罷。上海市  柯定　　好似變幻莫測的萬花筒！　　早　上，我在六時半的時候，就推被而起，披衣而行。走到馬路上，一些也看不到昨晚的明燈照耀，男女雜沓的景象；祇看到迷濛著霧的當前，聞到　齪着氣的來襲。再有糞夫推着糞車緩行，　塌的也挽着　塌車前進。其他祇不過二三巡捕，街頭躑躅而已。你假如早上未到過望平街的，那麽最好請你去走一趟。因爲那裏却成爲一個滬上獨有的（報市）。從申報館門前起一直到四馬路望平街的兩頭，都是報販的世界。六時以前，他們都忙着到報館去拿報，拿了來之後，他們丨有些大槪是全家的人都出來。丨大家摺報，很有次序的把他分别，來等待他們的主顧。七時以後，是他們營業最旺盛的時期，有些女掌櫃們，數着銅元包起，一包一包的堆着預備去换大洋或鈔票。聽說，他們每日的盈餘，總在中等職員以上吧！未經世故的朋友，想到上海來玩玩，或是到上海來有些事情，行李帶得累贅一些，一下火車，就感到困難。行李却已經由月台送到車站之外，在這個時候，使你眞有些麻煩，旅館茶房的呌喊，黄包車夫的兜攬，以及汽車夫馬車夫的煩囂，簡直使你頭暈腦脹。同時有一般人，自獻慇懃，來代你拿行李，你假如不在行些，或許你的行李，會給他東擠西擁而竟至不見。還有一般人，看見你帶了許多行李，自已不能拿，他來招待你雇車，你和他價錢講好，他另外去呌個黄包車來，他就問你要錢，也付那黄包車夫，不過你付的一半。這就是黄包車的掮客，他是賺佣金的貪圖便宜去向馬路上穿着舊軍衣的人買錶，這簡直大大的上當。因爲以我的經騐來證明，南京路中，也有這麽一個，他是常年在賣錶的。不過他說：我是從軍受傷，無法可想，欃拿此錶賣去據内行者說：（這是一個騙局！）說與做  涂紅霞　　只能說不能做的中國人丨　　昨　天，跑到一位朋友家，看見他自訂的一張溫課表，自上午四時直到下午十二時，除掉學校上課和喫餟的時間外，差不多没有一刻的時間空著，這種勤苦耐勞的精神，的確令人佩服，當我詢問他的時候，他的小妹妹在旁揷嘴道：（他，除掉學校上課，從來也没有翻過書本，你以爲他的功課表，訂得好嗎？）他聽了，臉紅紅地，默然無語。我想：中國，不論是天大般的大事，芝蔴般的小事，都作如是觀：因爲說大話，是中國人的天才，說的驚天動地，做得聲息毫無；無證不明，請看事實：三個人合股開一爿豆腐店，組織的時候，憑同中人，訂立許多條件，大家應該如何的努力工作，共謀營業的發展，但是，結果，甲每天拿錢去賭，乙每天拿錢去嫖，丙看了他們的舉動，也從而學習，以致生意毫無，豆腐榨上的灰土寸把厚，豆腐鍋裏生了鐵銹。一個機關主要人登了臺，旁的不做，行李剛剛舖好，第步先要發表今後的計晝，說的儘管離事實十萬八千里，然而只要動聽，至於能不能做到，用不着顧　，因爲（說）是本分，（做）是情分。爲什麽呢？定理是這樣的：（不說而做）是呆子，（說而又做）是痴子，（不說又不做）是廢料，只要（說而不做），才是絕頂的聰明人。因爲中國絕頂的聰明人太多，所以中國的一切弄得一塊籍糕。唉！聰明人呀長篇小說東北四連長  張恨水　　第二回　陋室結芳鄰暗欽健叟　權家擇良伴痛詆貧姓　　這　些佈置：桂枝是不大認識，不過看到原來很簡陋的屋子，現在却佈置一新。正中兩椅一桌，兩邊四椅兩几，完全是個舊家庭的樣子。桌子上擺了一架鐘，兩隻花瓶，還有一套茶具，壁上都隨便的掛了幾樣刀棒之類。他娘兒倆一進來，趙翁一面扣着披起來的皮袍鈕扣，一面向他們點着頭道：請坐，我沏得有熱茶喝一壼罷，這屋角上按置了一個鐵鑪子，鑪上放了一把白鐵壼熱氣氣突突，正由壼嘴子裏，向外衝着。只這上點子表示，便覺屋子裏暖氣如春。茶几上下，擺着四盆紅梅花，兩盆緣的麥冬草，在住土坑報紙窗戶的人看起來，一個大門之内，未免有天上地下之分了。江氏笑道：呵喲丨這屋子裏眞收拾得好。趙翁笑道：我倒不講究這些個，都是我們孩子幾個把兄弟，大家送的東西。其實我在店裏給人家管帳總是睡在帳房裏的，那裏有這樣舒服？人生在世，吃有吃的地方，睡有睡的地方，也就得了，我倒不求這樣過分的舒服。請坐請坐。說着話時，他自已捧了一把大茶壼出來，抓好茶葉，就提了水冲着。又抓了兩碟瓜子花生，放在桌上。他就向娘兒倆拱拱手道：隨便請用一點。我這人就是不知道客氣，咱們在一處住得久了，你就知道我是怎樣一個人了。江氏在椅子上坐着，桂枝爲了這二人是長輩，未便隨意就坐下，只得斜側了身子，站在一邊。趙翁笑道：姑娘，你坐下罷。關起大門來，我們都是一家，不要拘這些禮節了。桂枝笑着，在靠門最前面一張椅子上坐下了。趙翁手摸了鬍子，望着他點兩點頭，然後問江氏道：老太太，您府上在旗吧，江氏答應了是。（一七）婦女的樂園女性呐喊  慧殊　　我　不樂意聽婦女們自綏之言：儂不幸而爲女子身！女子一樣可以自立，一樣可以治家齊國。女子並不怯弱，擎着槍桿兒的女義勇軍，樣可以抵禦强敵。不過社會上大部人的觀念，依舊脫不了女子要被男人們輕視！或者男子們以爲女子解放的結果，會走到（墮落的阖途！）但是我絕對不相信這是事實。因爲女子有知議，有學問，有高尙的人格。女子决不能永久屈服於男子　威之下，女子不有再作男子的妾滕，女子也不會承認是男子的玩物。自由的女性，平等的人類，男子决不敢侵略（純潔）的女子！然而上下數千年，同胞二萬萬，永久陷落在萬丈深坑，黑暗生活中的姊妹！依赖性成，家禽一般地厮守。大多數仍抱着（嫁漢嫁漢，穿衣吃飯！）養成了（亡國奴的習性！）男人們說上東，你不敢向西去；男人們說望南，你可有朝北走的勇氣？（平等解放，）（職業獨立，）那一天纔普遍實現！母親須知  鵑雲　　領　孩子最使人心焦煩膩。小孩子嬌貴像金錶，須有規定地向前走吃東西是對於孩子重要的關鍵，旣不可太動，也不宜疏懶。有許多母親因爲孩子是橘子吃壞的，便永久不讓孩子吃橘子，這法子似乎太笨了。（領孩子帶三分飢三分寒。）這是一句老話，頗有至理。有錢人家的孩子總捨不得有一些凍，挨一些餓，反到常常生病；忍飢耐塞瓣貧苦兒，却一樣的活活潑潑，一點毛病也没有。孩子愛無事吵閙，自然也感到無聊諔寞，母親應用新奇吸引方法分散他的心。有主張打一頓的，適足增長孩子的惡劣感想，並不聰敏。關於產婦  雲　　生　產孩子是婦女們的一重難關，所謂（一條腿在棺材裏，一條腿在棺材外。）尤其是頭生，這是人人腦子裏這們想的。十個月懷胎，各部份都起了不同的變化，子宫的彈性漲縮，神經上受了不少的創痛。似乎在產婦懷胎以後，肚子上都須帶着一個束緊的肚兜。帶肚兜並不是嫌大腹便便難着，實在是幚助將來生產時孩子容易下地。收生的手術最忌使淤血染進了子宫　，生了危險的子宫炎。在西醫對於產婦發炎，是主張用冰袋冰的，但是這種試騐的結果，已慘死了多少可憐的產婦！每每服些中醫和平的藥，雖則躭延些時日，倒是有不少能夠獲救的。也許中國人體質和西洋人不同的原故。無論是素來多們强壯的身子，在產後兩星期之内絕對不宜走動。要是產後三天，經醫生證明没有病，便可以略略升起。開開窗子，深深地習着呼吸；或著平臥在牀上，伸直了脚趾頭，并緊了兩條腿，挺一回身子，再緩緩放鬆。這種簡單的練習，是帮助肌肉組織的增長，漸漸恢復了懷孕以前的原狀。無論如何，產婦在懷胎以後，處處須有相當的保護與衛生。危險的事實，大都是疏失與不衛生所致！</p>

<p>申報醫藥週刊本期目次　　上海市十年醫藥島　(續）　　　　　京同航空救國與醫藥救國　　　　　汪企張肺癆病分類法之新近傾向（一）劉榮敬科學的達生篇（九　　　　　　兪松筠中藥西用（續）　　　　　　　周夢白醫師的社會任務（五）　　　　范守淵上海市十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）  龐京周　　第四章業務之情形（續）分論各科專家的業務，當然外秚最好，内科最次，因爲社會上至今有深入腦筋的印象，呌做（外科西醫好，内科中醫好。）並且外科的手術，的確來得奏效顯明。然而經外科手術不愈，死去的也甚爲狼狽，外科手術不佳的絲毫不能冒充好手，外科先生没有好好的手術室，不能行使他的業務。中國人在十年以前，凡是手術往往假手於外國，近十年來雖則人材輩出，然而一般人的迷信外國人，依舊很甚。習外科的人，在外國果然輪不到操練許多手術，而到了中國，又因爲醫院太少的緣故，没有地方工作，就在醫院工作的幾位，又因爲不掛招牌，變爲姓氏，不見經傳，而享名很難，而練習的機會大都爲外國人奪去，所以市上外科醫師又那一個不兼治内病呢？至於内科專家，冒充都很容易，即使眞有研究的内科專家往往與舊醫同時會診一病而奏效不能居功，甚至在病在垂危的時候，負一個要强心針的責任罷了。眼科在中國習慣上本來與其他科目分得很清，所以社會上對眼科專家認識較切，加之器械手術，皆非舊眼科所有，故而業務很發達。與眼科同等地位的是牙科，然而牙科醫師的業務，被銀牙匠奪去一大半，總不如眼科爲佳。產科在最近十年來因助產學校的設立，和平民化產科醫院的呼聲，確乎很發達，婦科究竟還在新舊相持之間，新醫小兒科的業務，與舊醫比較，那簡簡直範圍狹小極了。因爲新醫兒科有許多地方，必須得力於看護，而兒科看護的造就，根本不夠，即使夠用，病家也多一種擔負；若說辦兒科醫院來解决，則小兒住院實去我國習慣太遠了。此外皮膚專科，泌尿器專科，耳鼻喉專科，除了少數人士對他們有相當認識之外，一般人民不甚注意，因此他們的業務，大受打擊。他們爲補救業務起見，無非走二種途徑：一是提高診金，而變爲貴族式御用；二是帶診其他疾患；前者太爲平民化醫藥的障礙，後者未免埋没人材。皮膚病專家，本來總帶診花柳病，而花柳病被雜醫分去一半，並通醫師也分去一半，等到請專家治療者，所剩無幾，而病又太深，往往棘手。皮膚病患者，高級社會人，究竟較少，所以提高診金，便减少病人到極低限度了。航空救國與醫藥救國（上）  汪企張　　自甲午庚子以降，喪地辱國的痛苦，逐年逐日地連續而來，可是麻木不仁的政府，和醉生夢死的民衆，事過境遷還是熙熙攘攘，鼓舞昇平，縱有三五個先覺良人，唇焦舌敝地呼號痛哭，怎耐一薛居州，白雪和稀，有不幸的，還負了叛逆之名，身遭不測，不侫出世較晚前人事跡，或傳諸父老之口，或讀諸傳記之中，至於當時眞像，究竟怎樣，只有根根據孟子所說盡信書不如無書一語，聊以自解了，講到航空這件事，乃是最近三十年間方才進步發達，顧我雖不是航空家，但對於此道，平日確很留意，並且親身目睹她，逐漸的改良發展起來，尤其是現在轟炸我南北，攘奪我土地人民的當面敵人日本，可是他們並没有被人家轟炸受過創啊。他們並没有全國大聲疾呼的宣傳航空救國啊，他們僅根據了有備無患這句話，在暗中努力加工的進行，我最佩服他們的國事，家事，和社會上一切的行動，都很有一種步驟，應先的先，應後的後，應擴充的擴充，應提倡的提倡，應廢止的廢止；並且也並不是没有後備，或全盤統計，忽然舉，忽然廢的蠻幹，所以反對的，也往往無從其反對，從前有許多東游過的，回來了，每批評他們什麽不如我們上海，什麽不如我們北京，什麽什麽，不如我們漂亮闊氣；什麽什麽，不如我們繁華豪貴；這種膚見的論調，正表示我們民衆，没有世界觀念，和改進步驟的心理。爲什麽呢，因爲世界上，無論那一國，那一地，那一家，那一個人，都有他的一種長處，也各有他的一種短處，可是長短的見解，各人的眼光不同，食前方丈，侍妾數百，孟子不以此豪奢爲貴，菲飲食，惡衣服，卑宫室，大禹不以此粗鄙爲賤，蓋各有他認爲貴，認爲賤的所在，正是立身齊家，和治國平天下，各有他們的步驟，和注目點。日本呢，第一他明白自已，他是一個島國的地位，他又覺悟他自已，是處美俄和各殖民地的環境，他更感想他自已，在地球上居有色人種的孤立。所以他第一，便注目在自衛的國防，而盡力擴張海軍，先呑羣島，他又怕小小的一島，經濟物質，不能自已圖存，便想從周圍的薄弱處進攻，不消說了，我中國便是他的經濟和物質的一補充外府，而盡力着意工商，吸收財力，他又痛感到環境的歐美各國，進取猛烈，一切的一切，自已都勢孤力薄，危險異常，便竭力訓練陸軍，實現大陸政策，侵略中國，以厚他的國勢。所以他六十年來，按了這個步驟，對於國内的一切補充準備，和國外的勢力發展伸張，總先要斟酌考慮，十分鄭重，然後晝預算，再分先後緩急截長補短的着着進行。因此，他們大震災前的道路，要比到上海，眞是天淵。可是他這種不良的馬路，全國到處可以通行，又看到他們那種工廠房屋的建築，因陋就簡，隘爛不堪，比到我們工廠，眞是小巫見大巫，可是他能出貨，供給國内，推銷海外。又乘到他們的火車’那種狹窄卑小的情形，一見之下，好似玩具，那比我們國内的，廣大單軌，冠冤堂皇，可是他能全國通行，鐘點不誤，什麽材料，都可國内補充，還有他們那衣着，布疋，首飾等類，那一種比得上我們漂亮闊氣，但是他們，拿這種奢侈品的錢，都存在銀行郵局，或供給工廠，和國防之用，可見得他們，有全國整個的計畫，和治國先後的步驟，所以小小一個貧弱的島國，没幾十年，便神氣活現，列於世界五大强國之中了，這是不斷地歷年，奮鬥的結果，是刻苦地臥薪嘗肷的效能，决不是一時興奮，一時努力，所可立舉的。現在談航空的進步，大家都已明白，不過最近二十年的成績可紀，因爲以前，都是試騐時期，並不是實用時，所以失敗和損害上的紀錄，倒眞不少，這類經過的進步史我可不暇叙述，姑　人家去說罷。不過我這裏可說一句，我們當面的敵人日本，他並没有發明飛機的人，也不能大造飛機的國，可是他很了解現代世界的趨勢，立國必備的要件，和競存應循的途徑，所以認定了目標，倫呀，買呀，學呀，做呀，把飛機的構造和駕駛的方術，日夜不休，摳心挖擔的輸入，民間有志的，更犠牲了許多性命和金錢來研究，是我親眼看見，因駕駛不善，或機器障礙，不知跌死燒死了好多人，海陸軍中的置備和研究，更不用說了，倘然死了一個駛員或機師他們必定大開追悼會徵集勞卹金和安慰他的家族，敎養他的子女，種種的奬勵，使駕駛人員，有所依賴，可振興他的，努力奮鬥精神因爲飛機是有錢立時買得到的，人才是立時買不到的，那使人才，有錢可以買到，而人心，有錢不能買到，還是不行，所以航空救國的實現，必須有勾踐沼吳的持久精神，和忍耐品性，才可把人才的養成，和飛機的修理與製造，兩個要點解决，到那時，方能達到救國的目的哩！肺癆病分類法之新近傾向  劉棨敬　　　　總論從前對肺癆病分類祇注意臨床上症候，該病爲第一，第二，第三，三期。現在除臨床症狀外，須同時注意病理解剖，愛克司光檢查等而分肺病爲慢性（善性）及急性（惡性）二種，故關係較爲複雜。現在一般對於肺病尙多用第幾期等名稱，余特將此篇介紹於讀者。但闡明本文以前先極簡單的說以下各條：（一）肺臟之構造肺臟像一幹大樹，總幹是氣管，大枝是氣管枝，小枝是小氣管枝，最小枝是毛細氣管，樹葉就是肺胞。樹葉與肺胞作用相同，爲新近代謝方面最關緊要之部分。肺被肋膜所包着，有幾處深深被侵入而膈開，所以右肺分上，中，下三葉，左肺分上，下二葉。全肺之形狀如圓錐體，其尖處稱肺尖。（二）肺尖易生肺結核之原因（一）胸腔上口在小兒時是水平面，發育後因胸骨之下降，潮向前下方傾斜，因此肺尖聳出於第肋骨之上。（二）因第一肋軟骨太短及常有早期變骨等關係，致呼吸時不能扛起胸骨及所屬肋骨之前端。有以上關係胸腔上口因而狹窄，於是影響及於肺尖，呼吸作用同血行，淋巴流都比别處微弱，對肺結核菌之抵抗力就因此滅。少（三）肺病病理解剖淺說肺結核菌侵入肺内，若不死滅在某種條件之下發生病變。最初發生小結節（所以有結核之名）結節中央因無血管易起營養障碍即軟化（乾酪性變化。）此種小結節起初多生於肺胞壁間。氣管支周圍。結節軟化後呈崩壞現象，或因血管破裂，結核菌間接的達肺胞，（倘結核菌繼續不斷輸入血管内，即發生全身粟粒性結核症）或因氣管枝破裂，結核菌直接的到肺胞於是發生肺炎（乾酪性肺炎。）肺炎之範圍大小不同，或一葉之小部分（數小葉）被侵蝕，或一葉之大部分被侵蝕。以上種種乾酪性病變倘不痊愈漸次液化成濃，一部分被吸收，一部分由喀痰同時咯出此病變處即成空洞。不論結</p>

<p>自由談推測新局面  達伍　　雖　然華租兩界當局嚴重戒備，然而黨國要人，名流學者們却一面仍在紀念馬克思，據說馬克思的黨徒雖然應該反對，但馬克思主義却不妨研究紀念。因爲馬克思到底是影響世界的大名(流)。如果應用馬克思的辯證法來解釋，這是屬於矛盾律一類：馬克思旣可紀念，又不可紀念。講到辯證法，因而使我記起其中的(突變)。（按：有人譯作（奥伏赫變者卽是）突變云者，就是萬事萬物，日積月累，數量增加到相當程度，就要來一個質量的突變化。譬如不抵抗主義的數量增加，突然變作通電下野，一走了事；日本進攻，滿淵國的領土擴張不已，中國政府就要來(打開)一新局面之類都算突變。至於由（不抵抗），而（一面抵抗，）而（長期抵抗)，（而抵抗到底)，不過是其中的過（程）。倘使辯證法也可以拿來解釋中國的事，而無國性不同之敝的話，那麽如今將要打開的新局面，正是所謂（突變）的時候，從舊局面突變爲新局面。這要打開的是一個怎樣的新局面呢？愚民無知，恭逢（突變)，自然天機莫測。然而愚民正因爲無知，所以也只好憑空推測。這推有時也(其應如響)的。譬如軍長們通電請纓，我們就可以推測將要發行救國公債，趕快準備掏錢出來。總指揮通電决心抵抗，不失寸土，那就是預備棄城逃走，愚民們得自已先打定主意。那麽新局面的推測怎樣呢？約分數種：一，宣言（抵抗到底），民衆聞而樂，多多出錢救國。二，熱河東三省旣爲滿洲國領土，大清帝國曾立都北京，（按：卽全國統一後的北平）所以北平也得讓出熱河更不在話下。不久，滿洲國統一告成。三，冀魯察哈爾一帶危急總指揮們通電抵抗到底航空救國捐欵，每人一元，捐到華幣四萬萬元，買得飛機無數，無人駕駛，日本三島幾乎裝不下。四，要人會商結果，决議遷都喜馬拉山巓，作（長期抵抗），古物由租界西遷，寄存倫敦博物院，可東遷，存放紐約，或送到芝嘉哥博展會，列入中國出品。五，　　等省人民參加慶祝新國成立。中國政府派使致慶，（禮尚往來）也。然而這都是推測，信不得的。譬如，推測收復失地，就不可靠。所以，馬克思主義到底不適於中國，突變終不可捉摸。突變或者是不變，新局面也許還是舊局面。也說不定。河豚子  任叔　　阿　六不曾讀過動物學，不知道河豚底毒，是在卵巢裏。阿六了不曾讀過報，不知道什麽草棚裏江北老，饕飱一頓河豚魚，七八條性命就送往老家去了。但阿六有他祖傳的經騐，知道長子的河豚魚，吃不得：長白的河豚魚，就行啦！春雨下了幾陣，田頭上，秧苗兒緣上了油。大戶的田主，忙着管長工，僱短工，下田。小戶的種田人，也每早，肩着露的犁和耙，太陽下，鞭着條牛，往田頭去。阿六可閒着宕，没事幹。閒着宕，不祇阿六一個人。阿七，阿八，老狗，小狗，全閒着。抽哈德門，看天。說是年頭兒不行，天罣星下凡，打仗打大水也有點對，但洋鬼子，也靠不住：工廠裏，儘管拉矢似的，每天拉出些矢樣黄瘦的工人。阿六去年發了個心，在上海住上三個月，祇落得，喝一肚煤灰回鄕來。有兒女，有老婆阿；六和别人一個樣。老波却賢慧，一手好女紅。紡紗，織布，針線全能夠。但連王家看牛的都穿起籃洋布衫啦，阿六嫂子可就有點爲難了！去年十二月三十夜，阿六躱到山廠裏雄貓頭家去。阿六嫂子對打燈籠的磕上了幾百個響頭，也就挨過了這難關。今年阿六想借一筆本錢，種上幾株田，但鄕間田是隔年便的：今年便的田，要在後年種：這一來，阿六可就難挨啦丨於是阿六閒下來。閒下來，祇得宕着。挨着面子，借升斗。呌上幾百聲叔婆，太婆，撒上不少大謊：全是阿六嫂子能耐。挨過了三個月，現在是一粒米，也有點爲難了。阿六就想到這一着。熱面孔去貼冷屁股，阿六有點不甘心。這一着，可乾脆。好也一輩子，壞也一輩子；活着也一輩子，而　　　也一輩子　　宕上了街，往魚販子擔上瞧。（他媽的，這遭可不走運啦！十個倒有二個長子的。）魚販子恨恨地把河豚子往地上摔。阿六走過去，拾來；捧在手裏，往家走。阿六心頭穩穩地，遲早總是這麽着，想。阿六嫂子接過來，說是黄魚子，便往鍋上煑；雖然少，煑一鍋湯，潤潤喉兒也要得。阿六突然感到鼻尖兒酸啦！酸得像要打個嚔，透一透氣，笑一聲。可是怕會笑下眼淚來，也就宕出去。宕到溪頭，坐在一塊石頭上，看太陽。太陽向西挨，一步，二步：把阿六的人影兒也一寸寸挨短啦。太陽筆直地瞧上阿六秃頭頂應該回去啦，喝這最後的一口。但，祇想着，不動。小的們儘喊餓，眼圈兒跟鍋蓋上熱氣張，張得洋鈿那麽大又亮。姆媽！吃！吃！要吃，餓，餓啦！有氣没力地喊，乖乖的，等你爸來！阿六嫂子勸孩子們耐着等一點鐘，二點鐘，挨過了三點鐘。！唔！去啦！阿六下了决心。拖着脚回來。阿六嫂子打開鍋蓋來；一鍋子粥糜似的，河豚子給爛得過性啦。大家喝上了二碗，阿六便拖着脚，往破床上躺去睡。數着屋洞透裏來的陽光底脚跡，儘等着最後的一刻。孩子喝了二碗魚糜，精神飽滿啦，往外面玩去。阿六嫂子也蠻有勁兒打掃房子。夜！夜壓上屋頂。阿六可不死。兒女，老婆也一樣。活着，要活着。（活着！這對我是一種受罪呵！）阿六翻身起來，往屋外看月亮。（窮人。難道求死也有些非分？）對啦！這兒有條連環的銷鏈。没有阿六那麽的人，做點綴，田頭老關便雇不到廉價的長工短工：工廠老　也招不到便宜的工人。以烟樣的殘命，支持這社會享樂底一面，似乎是阿六們底義務。長篇創作時代與愛的歧路  張貫平　　海泉聽到這句，差不多要笑嚮聲了，忙極力忍耐着。朱先生是凑近他的耳朶邊，說了這許久的話，還不肯擺開他的口。海泉眞是再挨不住了。因爲他聞着了一陣陣的像陰溝裏發洩出來的一種臭氣。（朱先生，不要儘咬着我的耳根說話。說嚮亮一點不要緊，没有人理我們的。）（不可以，不可以！這些話給人家傳了出去，是不名譽的。）朱先生還是逼着海泉要領略他的口臭。（朱先生，你裝出這樣秘密的樣子，反爲不好。你又儘在說Ｓ社，Ｓ社。恐怕這車襄間有包打聽呢。）這一嚇才把朱　道的臭嘴嚇開了。（朱先生，我根本就不知道屬於Ｓ社的是那幾位同學。縱令知道了，也不便向他們疎通。萬一他們一口否認，又怎麽好呢？）（但是聽說你和唐耀星有特别的交情。）海泉聽見吃了一驚。他想，唐耀星便是Ｓ社的人物麽？同時他又想起了，今夜裏的約會了。（没有什麽特别的交情，只是同級而已。）（聽說你要和他們組織什麽文藝社，是眞的麽？）（没有的話，絕對没有的話。）海泉一口否認了。但他有點驚心，何以朱先生也知道這些消息。（唐耀星是Ｓ社的大將！）朱先生又低聲地送了一口臭氣過來。海泉忍耐不住了，取出毛巾來，擱在口邊，吐了一口涎沫在毛巾上了。（朱先生的消息何以這樣的靈通？）他以驚奇的神色問朱渭道。（嘿，嘿！我也有幾個羣衆喲！）這趟朱先生笑得非常可愛了。）務必請你向唐君疎通一下。）（好的。做得到的事，無不願意帮朱先生的忙。）海泉做了一個順水人情，看見該下車了，忙立起身來，向朱先生告别。（喂，喂。　　　　）海泉將近走出車門，忽然又聽見朱渭道在後面呌他。（　　　　　　）他翻轉身，望了望朱先生。（令先祖的台甫呌什麽？）（你問他做什麽？）文攤秘訣十條  孺牛　　一，　須竭力巴結書坊老板，受得住氣。二，　須多談胡適之之流，但上面應加我的朋友四字；但仍須議笑他幾句。三，　須設法辦一份小報或期刊，竭力將自已的作品登在第一篇，目錄用二號字。四，　須設法將自已的照片登載雜誌上，但片上須看見玻璃書箱一排，裏面都是洋裝書，。而自已則作伏案看書，或默想之狀。五，　須設法證明墨翟是一隻黑野鷄，或楊朱是澳洲人，並且出一本（專號）。。六，　須編（世界文學家辭典）一部，將自已和老婆兒子，悉數詳細編入。七，　須取（史記）或漢書中文章一二篇，略改字句，用自已的名字出版，同時又編（世界史學家辭典）一部，辦法同上。八，　須常常透露目空一切的口氣。九，　須常常透露遊歐或遊美的消息。十，　倘有人作文攻擊，可說明此人曾來投稿，不予登載，所以挾嫌報復。和與偷  健甫　　章　某偷了蘭性德等的詞，贓犯並獲，他本人俯首畏罪，不敢聲張。而有所謂（伯雨）也者却說他是和作，並引用范成大陳聘三等唱和的詞，以爲護符，他以爲這樣一來，便可以欺騙一般青年了。殊不知稍有常識的人，誰不懂得和與偷的分别。以中國之大，不懂得這個的恐怕只有雨一人了。一代不如一代，会倆傳到忘九的時候，他一進屋，便偷了人家的鑼，馬上自已證明他是有什麽東西。章某把秋字改成悉字，這傻子也居然來說是和韻，並還有臉駡别人蠢，眞使人笑破肚子。旣然偷整首的是和，那末，偷整句的呌什麽呢？最可笑的，是那一天在那副刊上與伯雨同時出臺的丑角，也演了一幕醜劇，他不僅把對象弄錯，而且自作聰明把别人不錯的反來改錯，一面又老老實實不打自招供出余某早已暗諷章某的詞是抄的。自家内夥裏都（牛頭不對馬嘴），又何必來露臉獻醜呢！</p>

<p>經濟專刊第十四期每逢星期一出版蘇俄農業合作之將來  威　　三月五日接莫斯科電稱：今日據國家政治部布告：現有七十人被拘受鞫，彼等自供圖謀破壞農產，造成災荒。此等反動組織，大抵濳伏於合作農業委員會及國營農塲之一部分機關中，尤以鳥克蘭北高加索及白俄各農業區爲最多。其分子多數係地主出身，其所採用方法，爲損壞機關車及其他農業機械；在機關車場及紡麻廠中實行怠工或縱火；並乘機刦奪級物，傷害牲口，破壞種植及收穫運動云。夫自五年計畫開始以來，蘇俄當局積極進行，孜孜不怠，尤注意於農業合作。本年一月，史丹林在共產黨中央委員全體會議席上，報告已往成績謂：（在四年又三個月中，已完成期前預定百分之九三·七，所差者僅百分之六强耳。至農民方面，已有百分之七十以上加入夸爾　士（合作農塲）。據此則蘇俄農業前途似大可樂觀，不待第二届五年計畫完成農民百分之三十尙未加入夸爾霍士者，必將悉數加入。少數反動分子陰謀破壞，又奚足慮乎然據五日莫斯科電述情形蘇聨當局似頗重視此事，一若蠢蠢欲動之徒足以撓其大計者。吾儕欲推測其未來，不得不先徵已往。俄國自一九一七年十一月革命告成宣告土地國有並設法促進集團農業；除由國家自營農塲以樹民間模範外，對於農戶各别耕種，認爲不合主義，乃提倡夸爾霍士之制，所謂夸爾霍士（Ｋｏｌｈｏｌｚ）者，係合作農塲之稱，攷其内容可分三類：（一）同耕式，各農戶僅共同耕種，所用農具牛馬仍爲私有；（二）阿推爾（Ａｒｔｅｌ）即農具同有式，除共同耕種外，農具牛馬亦歸共有，（三）共產式（Ｃｏｍｍｕｎｅ）除同耕同有外，更進而爲同衣食住。由上述者觀之，可知蘇俄所謂合作，與他國農業合作，全其性質逈不相同。蓋蘇俄土地國有，在他國多係私有；其農民之相互合作也，必保出於自願，在蘇俄則往往出以强制或避强制，之名，而行驅迫之實。當其革命初成，彼邦當局頗動行夸爾霍士之制，並對於私有榖物任意微發；農民頗懷怨憤，相率怠耕以示抵制，於是歲收大歉，野多餓殍。當局不得已而讓步，自一九二一年三月以後，改行新經濟政策，任夸爾霍士自行解散，並許農產品自由賣買其後更進一步，許農民雇耕（雇人耕種）轉佃（轉移其耕穩權是謂轉佃）。於是克勤克儉者流佃耕之地較廣，收穫較多，成爲富農階級；此種富農，與革命前之地主不同，乃係勤儉農戶在新經濟政策下培養而成。及五年計畫開始，又勵行夸爾霍士之制；嚴禁雇耕轉佃；没收私有之農具耕畜；富農悉被打倒，自培養而自打倒，出爾反爾，得毋類於兒戲乎？歷年農業合作之進步，由其統計數目觀之，可謂神速之至；但據一九三一年三月十五日共產黨中央委員會所發布告，似有不盡然者。茲錄該布告文中之要點如下：有許多地方當建設集合農塲之際，黨部及官廳置農民自由意思於不顧，輙用强制手段迫其加入。中農甚至貧農，亦被認作富農，受種種虐待，或被剝奪選舉權。不求農民了解。一味操切從事，以增加統計數目互相炫耀，竟有數處地方，僅在數日之間，統計數目由一成驟達九成，蓋仍不脫官僚積習耳。）彼邦當局所發布之統計，是否完全確實，局外無從慧揣外；人游俄者，欲攷查其眞相，除依賴此類統計外，試問可向何處另覓確證否？以愚觀之，其統計從使確實，農業合作前途仍難樂觀；蓋農民之加入合作，旣非出於自願，總難免有反動情事發生也。本年一月共產黨中央監察委員提出報告書，謂：（五年計畫之進行，障礙甚多，近年創設之農塲，欲在短時甚内成爲模範組織，斷無現之望。蓋由資產階級殘餘分子，混人國營農塲及夸爾霍士，濳施破壞手段，不使充分發展，此後須廣佈偵查網以防反動。）以此與本月五日之電文相印證，其中消息，難窺見一斑矣。金本位制之前途何如（下）  潘士浩　　金本位廢止論　金本位之立，未及百稔。當十九世紀之末，二十世紀之初，各國最從，正風起雲湧之候也。及一九一四年歐戰發生，世界經濟失其常軌，金本位制隨以動摇，停止者甚衆。其後經濟之恐慌不减；不般又以爲恢復金本位，即所以恢復世界經濟，英國遂於一九二五年首先恢復，蓋沙佛林固以世界標準貨幣自期者也。經濟學者有恒言，經濟問題，惟經濟政策足以解决之；經濟政策，惟經濟事實足以左右之。固也，世界經濟未上軌道，金本位制復於一九二九年發生動摇，英國雖欲勉强掙扎，而終不能不出於停止之一途其人各國之經濟力薄弱者，更無論已。最近有美國之金融恐慌，金本位制之動摇益著，於是金本位廢止論益抬頭。向來金屬學派（ｍｅｔａｌｉｓｔ）之說貨幣者易中之具也，價值之衡量也，財富之代表。也其本質旣如此貴重，本身應具想當之價值，故貨幣當以金銀等硬幣爲原則。據名目學派（Ｎｏｍｉｎａｌｉｓｔ）之說，貨幣爲法制下之產物。凡經國家法律認定爲貨幣者，無論其本身之價物如何，皆得爲易中之具，並得爲萬物價值之衡量與各種財當之代表。苟未得法制之認定，則具有充分成色之外國金銀幣亦僅得視爲一種商品耳。此二種學說，蓋完全立於相對地位。歐戰以前，金屬派甚占優勢。戰後以金主幣之不流通，後者之說轉見拾頭。而彰迪森（Ｂｅｎｄｉｘｅｎ）李富門（Ｌｉｅｆｍａｎｎ）且更倡新論，以爲貨幣不獨無須具備本身上之價值，並不必有其實質，祇須公認其爲貨幣，則貨幣之實效已舉無論其爲賤金屬也，爲不換紙幣也，甚至其他抽象的計算單位也，均可以爲貨幣豈特廢止金本位而已哉？德國論壇，以其國家之貧乏，主張此說甚力，近則英美學者亦漸有爲之張目者。此金本位廢止論之一說也。名目學派以抨擊硬幣者，抨擊金本位制。其說雖似澈底，而以博得世人之同情言，尙不若通貨管理說之動聽也。創此通貨管理說（ＭａｎａｇｅｄＣｕｒｎｃｙ）爲硜斯氏（ＪＭＫｅｙｎｅｓ）。氏以爲現在之貨幣金融，非金本位制度所能維持。須由政府發行紙幣，以提携之。申言之，卽一國貨幣之伸縮調節，當由政府審察物價利率及各種通貨數量，隨時爲相當之措置。彼金本位制根本已生動摇，金幣在國際間已失聨絡性在一國間又失調節一般通貨之彈性作用。對内對外均失本來面目。以戰後通貨之臌脹，人心之不安。若不由政府管理，國内國外貨幣金融之紊亂，殆無已時。若曰各國相約恢復金本位，無論在事實上金不敷分配，恢復云云，終歸空談。縱能見諸實行，而國外的不良影響，愈足以波及國内。在此世界經濟紊亂之時，金本位國與金本國之匯兌關係，旣以金幣爲清算之具。則國外物價如有劇變，國内卽起同樣之波濤，其弊何可勝言。反不若行通貨管理制，俾國内之貨幣金融及物價，得以政府之管理，底於安定。且政府管理通貨云者，亦所以管理匯兌也。其對内的主權旣經有着，則對於匯兌，自亦具操縱之能力。如提稱物價，如進出現金，皆可以調節匯兌者也。此金本位廢止論之又一說也。上述二說，其策略不同，而主張金本位之廢止則一。嚴格言之，前說當包括於後說之中，蓋其主張發行政府不換紙幣，固相同也。誠使其說能行，則世界人士所腐心之金幣問題，可以免除。貨幣金融上所耗之金屬勞費，可以節省，然政府非必賢明者，授之柄而聽其所爲，果可以無弊乎？無論財政竭厥，紙幣有濫發之虞，政局更迭，政策有不安之患。卽日當軸者能一心一德，長爲貨幣金融社會經濟着想矣。而新謂通貨及物價等之調節云者，究將何所依據乎？以現代之科學言，恐未能得到此類詳密的統計也。自硜斯氏之說出，學者頗有非難之者，蓋非無故已。硜斯氏輩之說，誠不免缺陷，但自其後之三四年，英國之金本位制，復而又停。則所謂金本位制終難維持云者，誠不得不佩其有先見之明。今者美國之金本位制又見停止矣，凡金之鼓鑄，金之輸出入，金之買賣，以及紙幣兌換劵等之發行兌換，皆受政府嚴格的管理。通貨管理說固不無相當的眞理也。前嘗言之，經濟政策，惟經濟事實足以左右之。硜斯氏說之缺陷，在對於事實，過分認爲可以計算。而其眞理，卽爲依照近數年來之事實，通貨固不可不爲相當的管理者。　　金本位恢復論　金本位在事實上誠已動摇，而在大部份人之心理上，似未動摇。蓋近十年來，世界經濟與金本位同陷於不安。世人每憶及從前經濟生活之安定，輒回想及於金本位制。以爲誠能使金本位制之國際間清算運河復通，世界經濟當可由安定以臻於繁榮。此種思念，不惟平常人有之。卽經濟學者，亦頗主張者。如霍雷德氏（ＲＧＨａｕｔｒｅｙ）卡薩爾氏（ＧｕｓｔａｖＣａｓｓａｌ）葛雷高理氏（ＴＥＧｒｅｇｅｒｙ）麥克諸氏（Ｍｃｋｅｎｎａ）等，皆其著者也。近在醞釀中之世界經濟會議，其籌備委員會亦屢有保持金本位之决議。考諸氏之所以主張恢復金本位者，其論據約有四種。（一）文化愈進，則主幣之實質亦日致於貴重。黄金爲現代之貴金屬，其性質又適於　幣之用。爲適應進化計，當恢復金本位。（二）金本位已有相當之歷史，幾成爲經濟上之信用標準。當此人心不安之時，如宣稱恢復金本位，頗足以安人心。且現行貨幣制度，名目上周以金幣爲主幣者也。以道德言，亦不容不恢復。（三）近代世界大通，經濟關係，日益複雜，而所以作國際之連鎖，爲清算之運河者，金本位也。自各國先後停止金本位，世界經濟乃失其關　。爲溝通計，當從事恢復。（四）金本位爲現行貨幣制度之骨幹。自失此骨幹，貨幣金融卽無法調節。於是物價紊亂，匯兌劇變，經濟　態，層見疉出。爲安定物價匯價計，當恢復金本位。根於上述之論據，乃有主張立卽恢復純粹之金本位者。亦有主張采用金匯兌本位制者。前者之說，以爲經濟力較强之國，應率先恢復，俾主要國之匯兌物價先得安定。後者之說，以爲目今通貨充斥，紙幣膨脹，金本位純粹恢復，尙不可能。應先行金匯兌本位制，俾國際間有用金之利，各國内免金荒之苦。在一定限制内，不換紙幣，仍得發行，金本位恢復論，似較通貨管理說等爲接近實際，但其所舉之論據五，果惟金本位制足以當之乎，苟有一種相當幣制出，俾現行之不換紙幣制得以整理，國際間復見溝通。則人心自定，經濟自安，安見其有背進北之原則者哉？於是有所謂金銀複本位問題者出焉。　　金銀複本位舊說重提　金銀複本位原爲貨幣史上之宿題，自一八一六年英行金本位制，歐美各國之力未能與步者，不無異議。美以產銀故，主張複本位制尤力，嘗九開大會，集數十國公議之，至十九世紀末棄，主用銀者大失敗，而金單本位制則大定。複本位云云，蓋早成陳跡矣。近數年來，其說復張。英有大林氏（Ｄａｒｌｉｎｇ）美有波拉氏（Ｂｏｒａｈ）湯麥氏（Ｔｈｏｍａｓ），法有凱勞氏（Ｃａｉｌｌａｉｘ），皆此說之權威者。但今之主張複本位者，乃國際的金銀複本位，其着目點在世界經濟之整理。此應值得特筆寫明者也。主張金銀複本位者之最要論據，首在金銀比價平衡作用之恢復。其言曰，自十九世紀下半葉以還，金價日漲，銀價日跌。歐戰起後，之五六年間，趨勢適相反。一九二一年後金價復日漲，銀價復日跌，至近年而益甚。考其原因，可謂由於各國以人爲的作用，重金棄銀而已，惟其重金，故有力者日致力於金貨之收買。而現金日以逃亡，金價日以掀抬，金之流通且日益减少。又惟其棄銀，故經濟力較强之國，務以銀貨向貧乏國傾銷。於是世界大部份之人民，其所有者莫非銀貨，而銀之購買力且日落。凡此種種，大半出於人爲的作用。歐戰期中金銀比價之復見接近者，因經濟有劇變，當局者願暫時放棄金本位之所致也。一九二一年後重見金漲銀跌者因人人腐心於戰後濟之復與，日惟計謀回復金本位之所致也。致近三四年中，則世界經濟愈落，而金市之人爲作用亦愈顯。美法諸國之收藏金銀，人爲作用也。美國聨邦準備銀行之以藏金特多，而故意維持金價至相當之高度，亦人爲作用也。苟不改正此重金棄銀主義，消滅此種人爲的作用，則金銀比價，永無平衡之日。主張金銀複本位者之次要論據，爲恢復世界之購買力。其言曰，全世界大部份之人民，其所持有者爲銀貨而非金貨。自銀價大落，其購買力亦激減。夫當前之世界經濟誠可謂恐慌者已。而其恐慌之主要微象，則爲銷路衰退，而生產過剩也爲失業增加，而物價下落也。一言以蔽之，貧而已矣。苟能解放銀貨，使其與金貨同躋主弊之列。則金銀比價，旣可平衡，而持有銀貨之大部份人民，自能回復其購買力。其能助長世界經濟之復興，當非淺鮮。嘗考金銀複本位之說，能了解銀貨之地位，誠數十年來之一大開展。與世界經濟之整理，不無裨益。且其方法主張國際間須有協定，以雜持其相當的比價。使從前複本位之唯一缺點，卽所謂格雷欣法則者，得受抑止，尤爲貨幣學說上改進之點。然比價之國際的協定，果足恃乎？設有疏忽，則金銀複本位制之精神盡失，恐徒足以增加貨幣金融之糾紛而已。　　金本位問題之擺墜止於何點乎？　金本位問題之於今日，可謂治絲益紊。上述種種學說，雖各言之成理，然孰能行之無弊乎？孰能以整理貨幣金融起者，進而爲世界經濟復興之助長乎？是誠一疑問也。古有之，窮則變，變則通。經濟政策亦然。無論何種學說，本有遠離事實而能成立者。今者金本位制在事實上已發生顯著的動摇，其不能再固執金單位之說，，理也亦勢也。又經濟事態，日臻紛繁，科學能力，有進無退。政府對於社會之經濟設施，其管理性日益大。管理通貨說之有相當的立足點，亦事理之所當然也。復次，不換紙幣，已成現代自然的產物。白銀問題，且日益抬頭，其足分金幣之席，似亦趨勢之已定者。惟金本位已有當相歷史，金幣本身，原無甚阻碍。其近年之失軌，實人爲的作用有以誤之也。雖或謂其產額狹小，不能隨世界爲同一之進展。然世界經濟若能入於正軌，金幣固未必頓失本位幣之可能性也。則金本位全廢論，似亦有未合。意者，在最近之將來，其將參酌於金匯兌本位制與金銀複本位制之間，成立一穩新幣制，以爲國際清算之運河乎？此固尙有研究之餘地者也。金本位問題之擺墜，謂爲未有定所可耳。夫貨幣金融者，經濟問題之一部份也。當此世界經濟失去正軌之際，國際清算運河之安定，豈容易溝通者。以吾人之意，惟有各國各自努力於内部之整理，使本國之經濟情形，接近正軌。而有貨幣本位問題，有解决之可能。世界匯兌，有通順之望。否則，卽今世界經濟會議，以全體之同意决定一本位貨幣之新方案。而各國之經濟若未軌道，幣制卽根本不能整理，空言何捕哉？至於經濟當如何整理，則吾人　爲惟有並行左列之二　方法。（一）統制經濟統制經濟（Ｋｏｎｔｒｏｌｌｅｗｉｒｔｓｃｈａｆｔ）與計劃經濟（Ｐｌａｎｗｉｒｓｃｈａｆｔ），卽對於一國之經濟事態，須有相當之管理與改善現制度之計劃也。誠能如是，則私資本主義上之流弊自少。無謂之勞費，與過分的競爭均可减少，換言之，卽生產消費，可以接近也。（二）節約節約爲治生之大本，一家然，一國然，全世界亦無不然。蘇俄近數年來之節約，人人之所知也。故其經濟亦有顯著之進步。今世之貧富，懸隔甚矣。大多數之貧者，固甚儉苦。而少數之富者，則奢欲無度。惟其奢欲，故祇知求本身收入之增加。於是企業浮與焉，固定設備過巨焉，競爭越軌焉。而私資本主義之流毒，無所底止矣。爲今之計，惟有提倡節約，以遏亂源。右之二法，眞所謂卑之無足高論，然世界經濟之前途，金本位問題之擺墜，繫於是矣。嘗與諸青來老敎授討論及此，不禁有無窮之感也。蘇聨二次五年計劃與農工業  胡楚玉蘇聨第一次五年計劃，自一九二八年十月實行，預定一九三三年九月完成。其間因進行計劃之順利，竟不及五年，至一九三二年末，已漸次完成，縮短至四年三個月。此其投資則以各種事業不能如預計之順利進行，較最初預算八百六億盧布，增加三百億盧布，則爲一千一百六億盧布。此巨額之票資，悉由國内之（蓄儲動員）中得之，用諸（一）進行重工業，（二）農業集團經營化之兩途中也，（一）工業經濟政策五年計劃何以置重於重工業，據史丹林所說，（五年計劃之根本，在於重工業，而重工業之中心，爲機械工業，何則，僅比重工業上，改造產業一般的金融機關與農業並建築其基礎在遇去四年間努力之成續，依共黨决議文所發表，工業之生產額，占全產業的總生產額之成，（一九二八年爲四成八分）國内之經濟重心，得由農村而移於都會。原來蘇維埃聨邦，本爲產業頽廢之農業國會，乃一躍而爲現代式的工業國，誠爲世界經濟發達史上所罕有。更查蘇聨去年度之工業生產量，比戰前增加三倍半，比一九二八年漸增至二倍。煤之生產量，在此四年中，由世界第六位，進而居第三位，鐵之生產量，由世界第六位進而居第二位，故煤與電力，殆居全世界之第二位，其工業中最重大的重工業，能照預定計劃完成者，爲電氣事業，此卽列寗所謂（蘇維埃全國產業的電力化，）故今日蘇俄已建設無數的發電所，全國電力，一九二八年爲百八十七萬五千基羅華特，至一九三二年突增至四百六十萬基羅華特，幾較從前兩倍半。至主要新創之工業，如馬葛尼德哥爾司克，庫士乃特司克的綜合工業，以及史丹林克蘭特，哈利哥夫之牽引機工塲，哥利克市之汽車工塲，海參威之機械工塲，沙拉篤夫之農具工埸，波勃刊戈夫，彼雷士尼亞，嚴夫之化學工業，特乃普爾，西爾得烏拉等發電所，不遑枚舉。次爲土耳克西普之新設長距離鐵道與華爾街河與藤河間連絡之大運河計劃。尤堪注目者，如連絡海參威之鐵礦與中部西伯利亞之煤，此二大综合工業之建設，行將竣工，因此蘇維埃聨邦之經濟中心，將由歐俄移至西部西伯利亞。（二）農業經濟政策　農業方面五年計劃之重心，如史丹林所謂之農業集團經營化。在四年間，此種政策實施之結果，例如新設的集團經營耕地約二十萬處，農村社會主義協同組合約五千處，其耕地達二千五百萬畝，幾占全國耕地總面積之八成，目下蘇維埃政府，特各北加夫加士方面，傾力發展，該處所謂克庚的國營農塲，大都爲共同經營農塲，因富農階級之抵抗，非常强硬，進行頗爲困難，所以傾力於此者，亦爲此故，此處經營成功其他可迎刄而解矣，總之，蘇聨農工業之革新進程，實有一日千里之勢。故史丹林常曰，吾人對於五十年一百年之舊式農產業，今當在十年前後，急速完成，此種理想的論調，今竟見諸事實，但事實上仍不免發生障碍，因此蘇聨政府，對於第二次五年計劃，已改變方針，力避急進主義矣。（三）二次五年計劃　一九三三年度，蘇俄產業計劃之大方針，預定投資本百八十億盧布，减少生產費一成五分，以期全國的產業總收入，可達五百五十億盧布。其中工業方面主要生產，預定如下，（一）電力百六十三億華爾脫，（二）鐵二千五百萬噸，（三）煤油二百四十萬噸，（四）煤八千四百萬噸，（五）機械六十五億八千五百萬盧布，（六）牽引機（Ｔｒａｃｉｃｒ）六萬架，（七）汽車四萬輛，（八）機關車千百七十五輛，（九）車輛三百三十四輛（十）化學工業品十八億四千萬盧布，（十）（一）輕工業生產品八十八億盧布，（内棉布二十七億五千萬Ｍｅｔｅｒ鞋八千萬雙）（十）（二）糧食品七十億盧布，（十）（三）木材二十一億盧布，從事於此等生產之勞動者，爲數六百五十四萬三千人，農業方面，預定今年供給耕地總面積一億三千三百五十萬海克太，牽引機八十七萬架，（全部俄國製）機械類約五億五千萬盧布。特對於國營農塲集轉農塲，投二十五億五千萬盧布，使收獲得以大增加。他如栽培棉花，發展牧畜，尤爲注意，常第一次五年計劃，首重榖物問題，第二次五年計劃，謀增大繁殖家畜之商品，由根本上解决一切。交通方面，投三十億盧布，預備開通莫斯哥至東巴司線，紫塞溪至麥葛尼得哥爾司克線，以及聨絡中央亞西亞之加拉康大，康臘特，泰秀肯特，伊爾馬則克等鐵道網約二萬五千基羅至三萬基羅。大約一年間之鐵道蓮輸量，爲三億噸，船簲舶輸送量爲三千五百萬噸。如此偉大規模，自較第一次五年計劃之進行，尙爲緩慢，不過蘇俄對於新設工業之進展與國營農塲集團農場組織之確立，能傾其全力經營，不患各種計劃之不能實現也。總之，蘇俄第一次五年計劃，以發展重工業爲主，（即機械工業土木工業等）供給消費的物品等輕工業爲輔。例如糧食品衣服日用品等）至於第二次五年計，劃則適相反，以經工業爲主，重工業爲輔。輕重相伴，俾得完成產業之均衡，即遵照由量而至質）標語，力謀一般日用品生產之發達，動勞階級之文化的物質的生活向上。故日第一次五年討劃爲（新建）設之時代，第二次五年計劃，係（新建設補充）時代也。倘此計劃完成，恐全世界各國，無與四敵矣。商業新聞　　金融　　星期銀洋拆息平淡昨日星期、銀行照例未有市面、對於各方面形勢、隨之冷淡、市塲中洋銀兩種拆息、依然無重大軒輊、早午兩同爲四分、星期例無劃頭市面、做出匯劃票欵早市祇有七萬、午市亦僅三十八萬、拆票交易銀欵三百二三十萬、洋欵不及二百萬、錢莊洋公單收解五百四五十萬、銀公單收解一千六百餘萬、小錢莊交易四十餘萬、輔幣江南小洋早市及午市同爲六錢一分七釐、交易祇早市二千角、廣東小洋早市爲五錢七分九釐七毫半、午市爲五錢八分、交易早市四萬角、午市二萬五千角、銅元未有更動、仍爲四百二十四千文早市　　　　　　午市銀　　　　　　　四分洋江角六錢一分七釐　　　　六錢一分七釐廣角五錢七分九七五　　　五錢八分拆兌一千二百卅三角三　　一千二百卅二角八鋼元四百二十四千五百文　與早市同衣牌三千零三十五文　　　與早市同角坯二百四十六文　　　　與早市同貼水五十七文　　　　　　五十七文證劵　　不安定的上週公債　　北帮忽多忽空各債升降不定　　結果續漲幾角至一元餘不等　　上週三月十三至十八日、華商躦劵交易所、債市經過、與前週情勢略有不同、一般人認爲外交有新途徑、此說仍米成立、故上週之忽漲忽跌、已大半操之於北帮之手、而北帮之忽多忽空、又完全以天津之有無變動爲標的而津變之空氣、忽緊忽鬆、北帮疲於奔命矣、蓋北帮以消息較　、而又欲得事機之先、其出也湧、其進亦猛、故市價亦隨之升降不定、適以大戶多頭不動、散戶因市價恍惚而觀望、並非北帮之能左右市價也、週一稍有軋空、北帮猛進、市價漲一元數角、週二散戶仍有補空、北帮又轉賣出、市價微小數角、週三市上多空皆有掉期、期北帮又狂進、價又漲一元餘、週四五因津謡又起、北帮又偏重賣出、兩日間跌去兩元左右直至週六、北帮住手、交易亦清、市面比較平定而略漲、一週結果、仍漲起數角至一元餘、其漲跌理由、頗屬單純、蓋以戰事前途、尙無顯着之進展、投機家仍不免在黑暗中摸索耳、交易除十四及三十四號最爲靈敏而較鉅外、其餘各號、進出亦尙不寂寞、成交總數、計共五千五百六十九萬五千元内現貨計三萬元、期貨鹽稅一種佔一千二百七十餘萬、裁兵佔九百四十餘萬、統稅佔八百五十餘萬、一九關一九善兩種佔九百餘萬、廿捲廿關兩種佔一千一百五十餘萬、其餘各種祇數萬至六七十萬不等、紗花　　美棉行蹤極感飄忽　　英印埃一致傾跌　　昨日美棉市况參差不定、先因多頭了結而疲、後因同業買進而堅、計期貨漲一至三磅音、現貨不動、英棉期貨跌九至十一點、現貨跌十二點、埃及棉現貨跌十五點、印棉投機家及經紀商買進、計平果爾跌二·七五羅比、奥姆辣跌二羅比、白羅溪跌三·五羅比、原電錄左、（十八日電）　　美棉　比上日合申規英棉比上日合申規三月　六四０漲　一二九·一０　三月　四九六跌　九　三二·三０五月　六四七　二　二九·四０　五月　四九六　九　三二·三０七月　六六一　平　三０·一０　七月　四九七　一０　三二·四０十月　七八二　平　三一·一０　十月　五０一　一一　三二·七０十二月六九八漲　三　三一·八０　一月　五０六　一一　三三·一０一月　七０七　二　三二·三０　現貨　五一四　一二　三三·七０現貨　六五五　平　二九·八０　埃及　七一四　一五　四六·四０平果爾　一五０·００　跌二·七五　二二·五０奥姆辣　一六九·二五　二·００　二五·五０白羅溪　一八三·二五　三·五０　二七·六０上海各棧存棉統計　　三月十七日調查花　　　本届數量　　　比上届增減陜西花　二、八七七七件　减　六二０件　寳花　二七六六三件　增三、三四五件美國花　三九、０八三件　又三、三０三件　筒花　四、七七六件　　又　六０三件印度花　一０、三一二件　又四、一０二件埃及花　三００件　　　天津花　六、一０五件　　增　七六一件木架花　八、四二０件　　减三、一五八件通州花　三、一八一包　　又二九四包餘姚花　二、二六九包　　又　八一八包　　　糧食河下米銷呆平定（滬南）昨來源較稀、到船僅十餘號、城鄕店胃轉懈、包胃動辦亦僅六七百百石、以是形勢呈平、蘇同常帮及青南港等米無軒輊、變阾元亦已轉定、惟杜洋尖以北市疲跌、随軟角許而已、　　　元　　　　元常帮頂粳　八·六０　　　　　　同里釐尖　七·四五至七·四０常帮白粳　八·００至七·六五　青角薄稻　七·三五同里白粳　七·二０　　　　　　青頂　稻　七·八五吳江白粳　七·二五　　　　　　泗涇薄稻　七·三五北㘮白粳　一·二五　　　　　　楓涇薄稻　六·八０至六·七五黎里白粳　七·一０　　　　　　西塘薄稻　六·七０至六·六七蘆墟白粳　六·八五　　　　　　練塘薄稻　六·七０至六·六五平望白粳　七·二０至七·一０　松江薄稻　七·００至六·五０盔澤白粳　七·００至六·八０　洙涇薄稻　六·八０周莊白粳　七·００　　　　　　汆來廟又　六·八０陶莊白粳　七·００至六·九０　黄橋薄稻　六·九０至六　八０震澤白粳　七·三０至七·二０　山塘早稻　七·二０陳墓白粳　七·二五　　　　　　張堰早稻　七·一０至七·００蘇

<p>談言厲行疓髮  賡　　　魯省主席韓復榘氏，近特將通令各縣厲行疓除髮辮，限三個月内，男子不許一人再帶髮辮，當此全國苦心焦慮，共思應付國難之際，韓氏能由大家應站在一條戰線上的脚跟，整頓到鄕愚的頭髮之上，不能不謂對國事（盡心焉耳矣）！可是在另一觀點上說，革命革了四十多年，民國成立亦已二十二年，北伐成功，近年魯省亦同樣的（懸黨旗）（唱當歌）（讀遺囑）（靜默三分鐘）而大幹其（黨務工作）怎麽對此一樁象徵（封建餘孽）的髮辮，猶末澈底剷除，識者寗不贈以（遑論其他之評語？）雖然，天下老鴉一般黑，即素稱中國文化之重心的上海，亦未嘗不發現蓄長髮辮之怪象，試靜觀横奔過熱閙馬路之人，有時被風吹落瓜皮小帽或下山虎式的毡帽，於是盤旋在腦頂上深居簡出的寓公丨斑白髮辮，居然也會如長山之蛇首尾相應的下垂於背脊之後。孫中山先生始赴檀香山創立興中會，一以（驅除韃虜恢復華夏）之宗旨揭示，廢清之捕殺黨人，大都妄以留學生剪髮者爲格殺無類之標準，反之，今日日僞密約，擁護漙儀復，辟成立。（中華合衆帝國）將進而奪平津，並勾引各處無智分子之煽亂，以資軍事干涉之機會（見十二日各報）。此消息所謂的無知分子，若輩蓄有髮辮之鄕愚，當然難免在形式上之形跡可欵。故魯省之厲行剪髮，尤其在此時機，在政治上實含有重大之意義。此外還有與此案相映成趣之剪髮事件，容略涉及之，浙江省立高級中學，規定下學期男生頭髮，須一律剪成平等頭：女生髮長亦有分寸，惟不得披肩，（詳論語十二期），以致引起（率性剃個精光）之提議，此似可稱爲剪髮之矯枉過正者。（蓬頭女子蓬頭嫁），在女子是多麽便宜的一件事。可是一部分妖艶成性的女子，又藉剪髮而作俑什麽（水燙）（火燙）（電燙），以及各色各種之（染髮），除每次至化洋二三十元，費此四五小時，毫無各容不計外，而且常閙出如舞女浦驚鴻因燙髮而巧用酒精，以致葬身火窟一類的不幸事，打失剪髮原意，幾不可以道里計，安得如魯省主席韓氏其人者，又有相當辦法，子以裁制。文藝遊仙詩同張文璚隱作（續）  錢夢苕仙没歲月閉靈扉，蝸角沈沈事漸非，三十三天人盡醉，玉梅花底拜眞如。梅伶南下演劇申江士女傾城往觀　尤萬丈閃星旗，仙刦蟲沙又一時，白鶴歸來華表柱，漫天風雪弔安期。日寇榆關安營長德馨等四百餘人死之麟膠鳳髓罷瓊筵，抛却瀛洲萬頃田，曾是呼龍笙瑶草，更無日地再耕烟。江蘇實業廳及所屬各縣農塲皆被裁鷄犬年來住上清，洞天紫府各經營，青宫仙格紛難記，丹籍明朝換姓名。三中全會議裁併建設財政各廳閬苑空多附鶴書，枕中鴻寳竟何如？夢雲笑電紛來往，獨少風雷辟歷車。國聨不能施日本以壓力三張影戲券的捐欵  壽康　　當我說起要到北京影戲院去看（城市之夜）的時候，立在旁邊的老友梁國柱很懇切和很莊重地對我說（小張，在你未去看戲之前，我很希望你體念一下那些受着痛苦的東北同胞，在去年一二八上海戰事發生之後，那些慘不忍覩的難民苦况，想你也曾見過吧？他們避在所謂安樂窩的上海，尙且這樣，那些遠在東北的同胞，在那天寒地凍中挨着飢寒，不知苦到什麽地步啊！所以照我意思，你與其享兩個鐘頭的眼福，到不如將四角錢捐給他們，想那良心上的目慰，總比享兩個鐘頭的眼福好得多了）這一席話，說得我看戲的心，立刻就無形消滅了，很堅决地拿出四角錢，放在信封裏預備送上，同時還有一位梁耀墀君撇着嘴對國柱說（你旣然這像說，爲什麽自已不拿出來呢？國柱聽了，連說（應該應該）一面摸出四角角錢交給我，耀墀見了，連忙向我要了那放着錢的信封，當時我以爲他又要暫時借用了，却想不到他摸出一張一元鈔票說道（讓我來凑滿一塊錢罷）於是不費吹灰之力，就收集了一塊錢的捐欵了。編者先生，本來一塊錢算不了什麽，况且又是三個人合捐的，眞不值得我來投一篇（一塊錢的來歷）的稿子，但是，如果天天掛着客滿牌子的戲院裏面的先生小姐們，也像我們一樣的三人凑一元的捐出來，那麽想必這一筆捐欵也洋洋乎可觀吧！當我將這篇說話講給我的不識字的家人們聽，又不費一些力收集了一塊錢，現在附上兩塊錢，請你先生代收了罷，並且希望你把我的意思登在貴刊上，那眞是萬幸了。（却酬）志同道合一個女理髮師的自述  閔亦超女士我是一個女理髮師，人家多看不起我，我自已並不以爲人家看不起我而看輕自已，我時時想着看不起的緣故在那裏：（一）是否因爲鄙視男技師而連帶了女技師？（二）是否因爲習俗把剃頭扞脚察背等，　爲下等戰業？（三）是否因爲女性給男性理髮爲不雅觀？如其是也，這三種見解，完全謬誤，根本不能成立，要知（一）理髮是一種職業，職業本無所謂貴賤能用自已的腦或力去工作，以工作所得之錢而生活，這就是我們（無論男女）人生的天職。（二）男女不平等，由於女子經濟不獨立，女子欲謀經濟獨立，必先學成一種技能，以爲謀生之所，從前依賴男子的劣根性，當然不能任其再存在。（三）技能分需要與不需要，易學與不易學，我們應該揀擇易學和需用的學習，上海女子理髮傳習所規定學習理髮，四個月畢業；且現時此種技師不多，實屬求過於供，殊非若其他技能之難學成更不若小學敎員謀求一位置之不易得。（四）理髮習成之後，絕不受任何拘束，有資產者，自已設店，無產者介紹工作，能雖家庭者，服務遠近，悉聽其便，否則一家大小之理髮，固無待求諸外來理髮師，全年理髮費，可省不少。總以上四者而觀，在目下女子職業中，理髮當然比較爲優越，爲㨗徑，我二萬萬女生同胞乎？切記少做被男子目爲花瓶的職業，多習（勞工神聖）的工作！自我職業介紹　　此欄來稿請逕寄本報業餘周刊社收胡情鴻女士，　浙江人年二十</p>

<p>電影專刊好萊塢的姊妹花  華明　　在好萊塢有名的姊妹花狠多，像曼麗畢克馥之與洛黛畢克馥勞萊泰場之與波麗楊，諾瑪泰美琪之與康絲登泰美琪曼琳瑪許之與珍妮瑪許等等。但是能姊妹二人同在影壇上居重要地位的祇有康絲登裴納脫與瓊裴納脫姊妹二人了。現在所講的就是裴納脫一對姊妹花。在好萊塢圔家在銀幕上度藝術生活的除了巴里摩亞家族之外祇有裴納脫家族了。康絲登的父親名字呌李却裴納脫，李却早年時曾在銀壇上和舞臺上同時享過盛名的，祇因爲家產富有，中年時即抛棄藝術生涯。康絲登還有個姊姊名字呌做白蓓蘭裴納德，當初在英國度銀幕生活時曾馳名全歐州。後來到好萊塢也曾一度現身銀幕，到出嫁之後就和銀幕生活永别了。白蓓得意的時候康絲登祇十幾，歲而瓊還没滿十歲。康絲登父女姊妹四人各人享過盛名，但同時在一起享盛名的祇有康絲登和瓊二人在現在時候康絲登得名之後，瓊即由她姊姊領導之下得了名。有許多人說瓊完全是自已向前爬而没有經過康絲登的帮助，但是，康絲登當初未得名時受過多少頓挫失敗，而瓊竟能一帆風順，並没經過多大的頓挫失敗，可見瓊有康絲登做她的前車之鑒，不致再蹈同樣的覆轍，不能說不得益於康絲登。但是說這句話的也有他的理由。因爲康絲登和瓊二人的作風是完全不同的康絲登完全是個趨向奢華的女子的雛型，她的作風善於摹倣大家閨秀的劇烈之虚榮與難於馴從的有錢人的性格。而瓊裴納脫的作風完全是個柔弱女子的個性，熱烈和謙和的寫照，在她的近作（我倆婚史）一片中可以完全找出來。但是這種種祇可以說瓊裴納脫没有受她姊姊的影響，而不能說没有經過她姊姊的領導帮助。康絲登和瓊二人的感情極好，堪稱一對好姊妹，所以在二的感表上說，瓊不見得不受着康絲登的帮助吧。觀衆意見對（琵琶春怨）的貢獻  椀　　　　　　　（琵琶春怨）的中心思想，是描寫新舊兩方的矛盾，要算是寫實派的白描劇。但是牠的題名丨琵琶春怨丨有點牽强，似乎不足以代表全劇的精神，編劇者要把牠題名呌（琵琶春怨）就硬生生把墻上掛著一張琵琶，臨了呌不會彈琵琶的李令嫻，硬去彈一回，來凑合他的題目的暗射（琵琶别抱）的意思，這是多末勉强啊！說到導演方面，也有狠大的缺陷：就是盲母聽著她的兒子文小卿死去的消息之後，没有表現着十分悲痛的樣子。而且登時會放開笑臉來，聽令嫻彈琵琶！這一段情節，眞是荒乎其唐了。還有接吻一層，在本片中，固然是需要的；但是鄭小秋那一陣狂吻，似乎是太過火了吧？另外慕華在和李令嫻同居工作的時候，他的上衣，爲什麽始終不肯脫一下呢？本片的外景固然非常之好就是一切的裝飾陳設都狠合乎劇情不能不歸功於劉晉三君祇可惜用許多紙屑來做雪飛到人身上顯然一片一片的碎紙把眞實的雪景都弄假了未免畫蛇添足啊我對（花蝴蝶）的意見  李瓊　　本片的故事很簡單，在意識方面，談不上什麽，簡單的說，只是規勸青年努力事業，不要沉醉於酒色和不忠實於自已的愛情。男女主角表演都很不錯，如像喬治歌唱的時候，瑪麗對他的愛慕而感覺内心的愉快，同時喬治與却利刻苦練習武衛終於打倒了許多名手而得着了法國角力錦標的時候。瑪麗和喬治熱烈的狂吻之後，接着瑪麗便意識到將來的可怕而感受憂悒，因爲這時的喬治已爲巴黎的婦女們所注意，誰都想奪爲已有。這些地方都是表演得很動人的不過，不需要的穿插太多，使觀衆覺得有些厭煩。然而故事的結稱是說不大通的，瑪麗因喬治久不回家，竟决心與其離異，這一點未免將瑪利寫得太（超人）了。及喬治因困於洒色，自戕過甚，終於賽拳失敗，瑪麗乃復歸於喬治，而表示其愛之忠誠，固然，這些都是津津有味的但是將戀愛脫離經濟關係，而架空起來了。其他各方面，在技術上總算不壞，但也没有特别可取之處。（白金龍）前奏曲  培　　薛覺先的（白金龍）雖是從舞台上搬上銀幕，不個並非是整個的搬上銀幕，而是採取其中的精采部份和一些動人的有名影曲。現在：特將它的劇情簡述介紹如後：海上白家飯店小主人白金龍，因見有旅客白玉娘者，美艶多姿，不覺傾心。某日，白家飯店舉行化裝跳無會，玉娘亦參加，白欲與之舞，玉娘拒之，離坐至花園，白追至，責玉娘失禮，玉娘即反唇相譏，白雖遭玉娘奚落，然愛慕之心，曾不消减，後思得一計，乃於夜深人寂之時，白着全身黑服，帶面罩，立於玉娘室外，玉娘見窗幃上時現黑影，驚駭不能入睡，乃招茶役睡室外以伴，而茶役即白所喬裝者習日，而自訴衷曲，向玉娘求婚，玉娘責以青年應立志上進，不應持富妄爲，白受此敎訓後慚愧萬狀，乃立志赴南洋，作振興海外實業，後在星嘉坡與張晋華合辦大規模之橡皮廠，已任經理職，而張晋華即玉娘之父，故白金龍終得與玉娘成爲眷屬也。她們爲什麽不結婚  無懷　　（人猿泰山）的女主角摩蓮奥沙利文說：我對於愛這件事，覺得非常可怕，對於結婚呢，那更不必說了，我雖希望將來能結婚，不過至早要在我澈底大悟結婚的價值如何，意義如何，並對於人生有何等的需要之後。　　（蝴蝶夫人）的女主角薛爾維雪耐說：我喜歡結婚的！如其能依照我的方法丨我們已覺悟從前的女子爲靠丈夫而出嫁是不對的，倘我們結婚而不能達到我們所希望的，那末何必要使事情弄得更糟，而受人支配呢！我厭惡爲結婚而失去自由正像怕失掉我的財產一樣，我的不結婚，也許爲着這個原因吧，羅潑范來氏說：結婚簡直是沉淪女子的人格，我决不這樣做，他們的愛是在追求的時候，成功了就要想法來管朿你，我是不服他們管朿的。康斯登克明說：我對於結婚有些怕，因夫婦間往往爲着自利的緣故，閙出煩悶，若夫妻同是電影界的人更易因各地位的高低而生意見。看了（琵琶春怨）以後  松夫　　我們觀了明星改變作風的第一次出品（狂流），總算還能使我們觀衆說得一聲滿意，可是這第二次的出品（琵琶春怨），實在使我太失望了。（琵琶春怨）的故事，差不多完全是封建時代的思想，這影片的主旨，不外乎提倡女性的貞節，在新時代的流潮中，還有這種没落的影片出世，我眞要爲國片前途悲觀。講到導演方面，已並没有見到什麽進步，老實說（琵琶春怨）的導演，還不及李萍情先生第一次的作品（舊恨新慾）呢。演員的表情，鄭小秋的小鬍子最使我難堪，化裝很是惡劣，高倩蘋的表演，很是平平，張敏玉是有表現天才的小明星，前途是很有希望的。總之，使我滿意的只有剪接，佈景，攝影，三者而已。我希望明星今後在出品上，再不要像這類没落的封建思想底影片，還是向（狂流）那作風般的影片努力吧。天一影訊  菁主　　（女工程師）改做（生機）　　天一一九三三年巨片（女工程師），在邵醉翁導演底下，由陳玉梅，胡珊袁美雲主演，現在趕緊工作，業已拍去了幾個塲面了。但是，連日來導演邵醉翁氏一方面固然忙該片的佈景，是印咸和新近進入公司的許幸之担任。於把（女工程師）開拍，另一方面則在忙於把劇本修改，并且决定把（女工程師）改做生機；劇本中的一幕偉構無線電工廠也决意改爲女縫衣工塲了，其他的劇情，也有許多修改的地方。趙靜霞重上銀幕　  墨客　　趙靜霞自脫離明星公司後，息影多時，雖受大華之聘，但大華始終未拍一戲，去夏趙曾在新新公司後面創設安樂冷飲部，因開支浩大，致未可赢餘，近悉顧無爲之大華公司攝影塲，俟强華公司范雪明之戲攝完，卽進行一無聲片，而與觀衆闊别多日之趙靜霞，也於此時重上銀幕和觀衆相見矣。電影小說紅塵（ＲｅｄＤｕｓｔ（二）  桀克暴風過去已是向晚，但尼斯和麥克騎着滿身灰汗的髒馬，跟着裝滿橡皮和苦力的牛車，沿着河旁一條高低不平的泥土路，行向宅塲而去。他們來到宅塲的時候已是滿地月色，牛車和苦力回他們的老家，但尼斯和麥克一直到了宅塲廊前下馬，但尼斯喊（居同！）没有一點動靜。他們就在廊下靜靜地洗了手面，但尼斯走進臥室，麥克跟着。居同在桌旁一張靠背椅上懶洋洋躺着，顯已失了知覺。但尼斯揪住他的地髮，打他兩下耳光，居同微微的一聲，但是仍舊不張開眼睛。但尼斯就同麥克把這失了知感的人抬到他的房間！沿着陽臺一排房間中的一個，也没有停下來點燈，他們就重重的把他丢在床上。（噲！什麽意思？黑暗中來了一個聲音！一個驚悖的聲音！一個急促的聲音！一個女人的聲音！但尼斯把電筒一照，注視着這婦人在床上掙扎坐起。麥克見她很年輕，就趕快去把燈點着，以便細看，她兩眼雖充滿着一種恨毒的珨俐，她飽滿的嘴唇雖則帶着輕輕的曲綫，她是年輕呀！年輕！可愛！美麗的鬆髮！但尼斯不動情的對她看着，（您在這衷做什？）他問。（猜猜看　　）這婦人給他慢慢的有意思的一瞥。（我知道），但尼斯厲聲的說，（您是從西貢乘船來的！同着他，是不是？）（請你把他抬出去，好不好？）這婦人說着，對那懶臥在床沿上的人，恨恨的一看，脚一伸，她把居同推到地板上去了，他咕嚕一聲，又像一團爛泥了。（您對他覺得那　樣子，那您又何必離開西貢呢？）但尼斯淡淡的問。（他答允我五百個法郎，）這婦人說，（現在我要這筆錢，急急平要，我至今没有看見這錢，）她又說，同時對着二人一看。你不會看見這筆錢的，）但尼斯直捷了當的告訴她，（他能不能有五十個法郎，我還不相信，）（怎麽！撤謊！好，任憑什樣，我現在要洗心革面！）她向下看看這泥醉的管事，（他要呌隨便什麽女子幹那事的，我要去！）（那條船四星期裏是不再來的，）麥克揷嘴說，看就情形很有意味。（不要挖苦！）這女子覺得不自在，然她聳一聳肩，（好的，這好像我葉丹在鄕憇忽！我常常喜歡旅行！旅行遇着些新人！看那一半的人生是怎樣的！）說完了的時候她受了震動的一雙緣眼向着但尼斯一閃。他轉了身說，一麥克，走罷）。（噲！）　丹向着他們喊，（你們是不是要把他丢在這裏？）（那是他的房間，爲什麽呢？）但尼斯答覆她。（請！帶他出去！）這女子向他們堅請着說，（我要睡覺！這地方盡是斷蜴蟑螂！）（未完）</p>

<p>After Li's Brigade Conducted a Night Raid on the Enemy's Rear Positions, Killing Five to Six Hundred and Capturing Many Machine Guns, Our Side Suffered Heavy Casualties; a Battalion Commander Died Heroically. No Enemy Traces Were Found Ten Miles Outside of Luowenyu.</p>
<p>Beiping - Our troops at Luowenyu, supervised by Liu Ruming last night, launched a two-pronged attack and engaged the enemy fiercely in the vicinity of a crossroads. The battle continued until 2:00 AM this morning. Over a hundred enemies were killed and more than twenty were captured. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - The 29th Army's Beiping Office received a phone call from the front this afternoon stating that there were no clashes on the main front at Xifengkou, and the center of the battle had shifted to the Luowenyu area on the left flank. On the evening of the 18th, Liu sent Li Jintian's brigade to bypass seven mountain peaks to the enemy's rear, advancing to the enemy's machine gun positions. A simultaneous frontal attack resulted in a bloody battle, killing five to six hundred enemy soldiers and capturing more than ten heavy machine guns, bringing back six and destroying five. Currently, there are no enemy traces ten miles outside Luowenyu. In this battle, Wang, the battalion commander of our 38th Division, bravely led the charge, sustaining severe injuries but continuing to shout slogans to kill the enemy. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - The Staff Office of Liu Ruming's Division received a phone call this morning stating that over three thousand enemies, a mixed force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Shanzhagang and Shabogang, with more than thirty field guns and thirty machine guns, were met head-on by the division commander himself leading the 1st Regiment's pistol squad in three teams, engaging in a bloody battle for a whole day and night starting at 1:00 AM on the 18th. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, the 1st Brigade Commander, Li Jintian, was ordered to lead the entire 2nd Regiment and pistol squad to reinforce, launching three assaults and killing hundreds of enemies. By 2:00 AM on the morning of the 19th, the enemy's artillery fire was sparse. In addition to killing over a thousand officers and soldiers, the remaining enemies have been completely surrounded between the two hills. If there are no major reinforcements coming, it will not be difficult to annihilate them soon. Our Regiment Commander Li once bravely sustained injuries, and two company commanders of the 1st Battalion were killed in action. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - A phone call from Santunying states that the enemies at Luowenyu and Shanzhayu, after being fiercely attacked by our army for two days and nights, with a force of eight to nine thousand, have all been defeated and are retreating towards Banbishan this morning. The fiercest fighting occurred on the night of the 18th, with heavy artillery densely shelling our positions. Our army was temporarily caught in a difficult situation due to the intense enemy artillery fire. Division Commander Liu Ruming sent Wang, the battalion commander of the 38th Division's Special Service Battalion, leading the entire battalion of soldiers to charge and kill behind the enemy lines. The enemy, fearing an attack on their rear, had arranged machine gun teams in formation. Our troops mistakenly entered the enemy's machine gun positions.

<p>Beiping - Qin Dechun wrote a letter to his friends in Beiping on the 17th, stating that fierce fighting has been ongoing here for ten days, and we endure hardships alone, causing great anxiety.

<h3 id="e14">The Impending Storm in the European Political Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Since the unprecedented panic in international capitalism in 1929, four years have passed with the situation deteriorating daily. Complaints resonate throughout the universe, and a sense of depression covers the world. In this cloudy and rainless period, people of the world are eager for catharsis, and the clear and bright days will eventually be seen again after a baptism of fierce winds and storms. This is inevitable due to the inherent nature of things.</p>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly urgent. The economic panic and social unrest have prompted Japanese imperialism to launch an intensified invasion of China, and this invasion has spurred the Chinese national anti-imperialist struggle. Although this struggle has been obstructed by domestic reactionary forces from time to time, the broad anti-imperialist revolution in Asia will eventually erupt from the Sino-Japanese conflict. This has been determined by historical trends and economic conditions and cannot be reversed by any human power. Recently, the rise of the reactionary regime in Germany has suddenly made the European atmosphere tense, and a second world war is imminent.</p>
<p>The second world war will be a conflict between imperialist powers, not a unified struggle against the Soviet Union. The start of the conflict between imperialist powers, with Europe, known for its developed nationalism, as its fuse, has long been foreseen by insightful individuals. The development of the situation in continental Europe in recent months has fully proven the correctness of this judgment. The anti-Soviet front in Europe was originally centered on France, with the Little Entente as its claws and teeth. Although conflicts between Britain and the Soviet Union occurred repeatedly, the frequent changes of government in Britain and the relationship between Britain and France, where two powers could not stand together, meant that the British policy towards Soviet Russia was always in a state of seeming closeness and detachment, sometimes separating and sometimes uniting. Germany and Italy, on the other hand, often maintained friendly relations with the Soviet Union due to their hostility towards France. The recent shift in the situation began during Papen's tenure in Germany. At that time, although the National Socialist Party had not yet seized power, it already had an irresistible force. In order to gain national sympathy and show goodwill to the National Socialist Party, Papen publicly proposed the demand for equality in armaments. As the German nationalistic movement intensified and Italy's momentum became increasingly aggressive, France, feeling threatened from within, had to shift its focus to dealing with Italy and Germany. France and the Little Entente then jointly signed non-aggression treaties with the Soviet Union, and the so-called anti-Soviet front disappeared.</p>
<p>In recent days, the power of the German National Socialist Party has been temporarily stabilized, and the anti-French united front of Italy, Germany, and Austria has become increasingly clear. The Italian arms shipment to Austria has aroused the joint protest of Britain and France, and border disputes between Germany and Poland, and Germany and France have also reappeared. The European war clouds are spreading, and a single spark could ignite a major conflict. At this time, British Prime Minister MacDonald suddenly went to Geneva and proposed his so-called five-year disarmament plan. Before Hitler went to Italy, he personally visited Rome to meet with Mussolini, using high-sounding arguments to win the sympathy of those who are living in fantasy. This has always been a common technique of individualistic gentlemen in Europe and America. To use the opportunity to obtain European hegemony through diplomatic strategies is also a long-held ambition of the British Empire. MacDonald's efforts can only be explained in this way. However, the so-called five-year disarmament plan is empty and meaningless. To try to save the dying disarmament conference with it is just a dream. The plan has already aroused criticism from both France and Germany. To try to reconcile the two parties and instead be opposed by both is almost inevitable. In the future, will Britain try to unite with Italy to control France and Germany? Then the question of who will hold European hegemony will become the focus of the struggle between Britain and Italy. We only feel that it will increase the conflict and not help the reality.</p>
<p>In addition to the tense international situation in Europe, the internal crises of various countries are also intensifying. Within a month, newspapers have reported events such as the resignation of officials in Spain, Poland, and Romania, a naval mutiny in the Netherlands, and demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of unemployed people in Britain. All of these indicate that the continuous line of social revolution has accelerated its density. All changes in history begin with tentative efforts that appear to be interrupted, leading to an all-out struggle. Therefore, from a social historical perspective, the occurrence of social revolution has already been in motion long before today. However, its intensification must be given time. The dictatorship of the German National Socialist Party will cause the domestic Communist Party to shift from open and peaceful political participation to secret and violent uprisings, and the compromising centrists will shift from illusory wandering to extremist fronts. This is also a desperate move forced by circumstances. From this, the division of the struggle will become more obvious, and the actions of the struggle will become more intense. To think that German society will enter a smooth path from here is truly blind and superficial.</p>

<p>Beiping - After the Hattori and Suzuki brigades of the enemy forces suffered setbacks in attacking Xifengkou, they began to shift their main force to attack Luowenyu on the 15th, attempting to attack Zunhua in order to flank the main front at Xifengkou. Division Commander Liu Ruming led his troops to engage the enemy, and after three days and nights of fighting, annihilated many enemy soldiers and almost completely resolved the enemy at Luowenyu, causing the enemy's second plan to fail. The enemy, having suffered repeated setbacks, plans to concentrate their main force within days and launch a simultaneous attack from the main front at Xifengkou and various passes west of Tongxian, attempting a large-scale attack. It is expected that there will be a major battle within a day or two. It is said that if the enemy attacks again and fails to capture Xifengkou, they plan to invade eastern Hebei on one hand and disrupt Tianjin and Beiping on the other, in order to achieve their goals. However, our side is fully prepared, and if the enemy attacks, we will resolutely deal them a head-on blow. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

A large amount of supplies and carts have been transported there, and they are forcibly occupying civilian houses, causing the residents great suffering. Recently, due to unfavorable advances at Xifengkou and other places, the enemy is cautious and shows no signs of attacking south. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>British and Italian Prime Ministers in Heart-to-Heart Talks</p>
<p>Solving Political Problems That Endanger the International Situation　　Depends on Close Cooperation Between the World's Major Powers</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 18th. British Prime Minister MacDonald and others arrived in Italy from Geneva by train, got off at Genoa, and changed to a plane to Rome, arriving six hours earlier than scheduled. Traveling day and night without rest shows that the British Prime Minister is eager to solve the major problems Europe has recently encountered. As soon as the British Prime Minister arrived here, he had a preliminary discussion with Mussolini at the Italian Prime Minister's official residence regarding the current situation. The first meeting between the two Prime Ministers lasted a long time and was unexpected. It started at 6 p.m. and ended after 8 p.m. The content of the conversation was not announced.</p>
<h3 id="e52">British and Italian Positions Are Generally Consistent <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>However, it is expected that the British Prime Minister will explain in detail his disarmament plan presented in Geneva on Thursday, because the British Prime Minister's proposal published in Italian newspapers is quite brief. After arriving in Rome, the British Prime Minister told people that although he only attended the Geneva Disarmament Conference for a few days this week, he realized that political and other difficult problems endangering the international situation do need to be resolved quickly. To get rid of the difficulties, we can only rely on close cooperation between the world's major powers. All Italian newspapers tonight also stated that there should be close cooperation between the major powers, and hope that after the meeting between the British and Italian Prime Ministers, the authorities of the major powers will immediately gather for discussions one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Comprehensive Discussion of European Issues <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Tonight, the Italian Prime Minister held a grand banquet at his official residence to entertain the British Prime Minister. This is the first grand gathering since the European War. It is heard that in addition to the disarmament issue, the British Prime Minister will inquire about Italy's attitude towards German Fascism after Hitler's assumption of the prime ministership, and the Balkan issue, including the dangerous situation in Yugoslavia, may also be discussed. There is no doubt that the World Economic Conference will also be discussed. Tomorrow, Sunday, a meeting will be held at the British Embassy to continue the discussion of everything. The Italian Prime Minister will have lunch at the American Embassy and meet with British Foreign Minister Simon.</p>

<p>Reuters, Rome, 18th. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon are very busy here. This morning, Mr. MacDonald was granted an audience with the Italian King, and then the Italian King gave a banquet. Mr. MacDonald's daughter was also present. In the afternoon, Mr. MacDonald and Mr. Simon continued to talk with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini until 6:30 in the evening when the time for an audience with the Pope arrived before they dispersed. The two British politicians claimed today that yesterday's talks with the Italian Prime Minister were very satisfactory. It is heard that the main issue currently being discussed is the possibility of reaching an understanding on the four-power consultation. This understanding is mainly based on Britain and Italy, and France and Germany are expected to participate. The revision of the treaty is also a major event for discussion, because the Italian Prime Minister believes that unless this move is successful, and the current mutual suspicion between France and Germany is eliminated, and the inferior position of the former enemy countries today is improved, there will be no progress in Europe. However, the Italian Prime Minister has solemnly stated that this kind of revision must be based on mutual agreement and must not be carried out by force. Mr. MacDonald was relieved to hear this.</p>

<p>National, Berlin, 18th. German public opinion has a very good impression of British Prime Minister MacDonald's visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this time. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that these two are both heads of state of a country, and both have made achievements in unifying the country. From a political point of view, the positions of the two are also equal, because they do not represent socialism, nor are they capitalists, but are representatives of the new era. Therefore, the meeting between the two can guarantee that they will be harmonious and unhindered, and the revival of Europe depends on the cooperation of these two.</p>

<p>National, Paris, 18th. Today, the Paris Daily News, in discussing the return of French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Pengu from Geneva, viciously scolded the British Prime Minister and his new disarmament plan, considering it to be treacherous and hypocritical, willing to sacrifice all countries in the world, while Britain alone benefits. The newspaper's editorial also attacked MacDonald, claiming that MacDonald considers himself an arbitrator and orders France and other Allied countries in the European War to disarm together. It ended by saying that MacDonald's intention was nothing more than to promote the re-signing of the peace treaty.</p>

<p>Havas, Marseilles, France, 18th. Herriot, the party leader of the Radical Socialist Party (the current ruling party) and former Prime Minister, published an article in the Petit Provençal, discussing the draft disarmament convention proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald, stating that France is under close surveillance at this time and must be extremely cautious. The main principle of the British plan is to engage in disarmament, and not to re-compete in armaments. Mr. Herriot believes that this principle is very good. As for how this plan will be implemented, Mr. Herriot will only express his opinion after he fully understands how the international supervision system will be organized. Regarding the military quotas of various countries, the British plan has set numbers for all of them, but it has never mentioned the military quota that Britain should have. Mr. Herriot finds this quite strange. As for the so-called consultation treaty, Mr. Herriot believes that it is still questionable whether the United States can agree to it. Mr. Herriot also said that the newspapers of the German nationalist faction oppose the British plan and are propagating quite vigorously.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 18th. The first official reaction to the disarmament agreement proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald on Thursday has come from the Little Entente. It is expected that this aspect will have a great influence on the future success of the British proposal. The representatives of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania met today and decided that the British proposal can be accepted in principle in both general and technical terms, but some details still need to be revised.</p>

<p>The Japanese Foreign Ministry Takes Preemptive Action</p>
<p>Engaging in Treaty Negotiations with Russia</p>
<p>Washington. Today, those close to the White House indicated that the day the United States recognizes Soviet Russia is very close. If there is no banking crisis, President Roosevelt may recommend this matter to the Senate this week. According to the Department of Commerce, the actual value of the US dollar has returned to the value before March 3. It is expected that the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia will be raised soon. It is heard that someone has suggested two strategies to the President: one is to first sign a commercial treaty, and the other is to immediately recognize the Russian government and then resolve commercial matters through formal diplomatic channels. The President's attitude is quite inclined towards the second strategy, but a firm decision has not yet been made. It is expected that there will be positive progress in the next few weeks. It is also heard that the recognition procedure will probably imitate the first agreement between Britain and Russia, stipulating that neither side shall engage in propaganda, and then exchange ambassadors, and then discuss commercial treaties, or even the debt issues of the Tsarist era. The main reason for this attitude of the US government is to promote the US goods market. The long-standing advocacy of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia by key members of the Democratic Party is secondary. However, no matter what procedure the US President adopts, it must first be approved by the Senate. Currently, the new senators in the Senate have not yet expressed their opinions. It is only heard that the recognition proposal can find the support of the majority. Among the 51 old senators, 22 firmly support recognition, 20 are still unwilling to express a clear attitude, and only 9 openly oppose it. Moreover, among them, only one, Copeland, held an opposing position before taking office in the new government, and now claims that he will vote in favor for the sake of commerce. The current Secretary of the Navy, Swanson, is also one of the supporters. When he was a senator, he pointed out that a new treaty should be signed everywhere before recognition, and the President can select an ambassador, who can go to the US after being approved by the Senate. As for the treaty, it may be negotiated later. (18th National Dispatch) Tokyo. According to a report from the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the new US government will adopt a new diplomatic policy towards Russia, and it is heard that it has decided to recognize Russia. In the eyes of the public, it can be said that the US recognition of Soviet Russia is a foregone conclusion, but it has been delayed for several weeks due to the domestic financial panic. There are two forms of recognition: one is to sign a commercial treaty with Russia and give it substantive recognition, and the other is to announce formal recognition and formally negotiate and sign all treaties required in diplomacy at the same time. According to speculation in the public, the United States will adopt the second form, which can be realized in these few weeks. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the approach between the US and Russia is very inconvenient for Japan's policy of dominating Asia, and has decided to hinder it in various ways. It is rumored that the non-aggression treaty between Russia and Japan will enter a new stage. (19th China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Sakou Hideichi, a councilor of the Japanese Embassy in Russia, went west this afternoon. Since the Soviet Russian side requested negotiations to promote Japanese-Russian economic relations after taking office, preparations must be made. Therefore, he took a counterproposal this time and will cooperate with Ambassador Ota. In the event of substantial negotiations, Sakou's activities in Soviet Russia are extremely noteworthy.

<h3 id="e63">London Attaches Importance <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>to the Case of Russian Arrest of British Nationals</p>
<p>London. The British government attaches great importance to the arrest of British employees of the Vickers Company by the Soviet Russian authorities. This can be seen in the speech given by Overseas Territories Minister Thomas last night. Mr. Thomas said: "To my knowledge, nothing stimulates British public opinion more than the fact that Soviet Russia has arrested many innocent British people. Those arrested are all people who have legitimate occupations in commerce, are self-disciplined, and have no grievances with others. It is strange to say that such people would participate in any conspiracy that would destroy their own lives." What kind of motives are behind Soviet Russia's arbitrary arrest of British people? I have no way of knowing here, but I know that previous governments have deliberately created external difficulties in order to divert their people's attention from domestic events. If Russia's real purpose is here, then I dare say that the British people will never be deceived by it. Commercial relations must be based on mutual benefit. If we want to facilitate commercial relations, we must not allow this relationship to be subject to undue obstacles. Although we do not approve of Soviet Russia's political goals, we have always expressed our desire not to interfere in Soviet Russia's internal affairs. If Soviet Russia believes that the commercial and diplomatic relations that both sides need can continue when British people are being trampled on by them, then they are greatly mistaken."

<p>New German Parliament to Convene Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Opening Ceremony Will Be Solemn and Grand</p>
<p>Proclamation to the Nation to Hang New Flags</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (National News Agency) – The new German Parliament is scheduled to convene at the Potsdam Garrison Church on Tuesday. Preparations are actively underway to celebrate the grand occasion, with the aim of awakening the German people's admiration for the glory of the past empire. The newly appointed Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Goering, also issued a (proclamation to the people of the nation) today, stating that the new members of Parliament will gather in the sacred place where the ancient kings of Prussia rest, to declare the German people's belief in unity and freedom. Since the founding of Germany, internal division has been the poison of the nation. Today, for the first time in history, the people of the nation can concentrate their strength, overcome internal disputes, and unite various ethnic groups, classes, and beliefs under a unified government. Germany has now awakened and calls upon the people to hang the glorious black, white, and red national emblem and the 卐 flag on the day of the Parliament's reconvening, to express the people's deep faith in the rebirth of the nation. In addition, the Ministry of the Interior has issued a notice ordering the entire nation to hang the new national flag and the 卐 flag on the day the new Parliament convenes. All civil servants will be given a day off, all schools will be closed for a day, and the Ministry of National Defense has scheduled a military parade at noon on that day. The national anthem will be played and a 21-gun salute will be fired throughout the country that morning. The Ministry of Aviation has also declared an air curfew on that day, prohibiting all aircraft from flying over Berlin and Potsdam. As for the opening of the Parliament, President Hindenburg will deliver an address, after which Hitler will announce his major policies. At this time, President Hindenburg will step down and go alone to the front of the tombs of former Prussian Kings Frederick William I and Frederick the Great to lay a wreath.</p>

<p>League of Nations Forms Advisory Committee</p>
<p>US Government Approves Geneva Action</p>
<p>Believes It Does Not Conflict with the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>Geneva, 18th (Havas) – The Advisory Committee organized by the League of Nations Administrative Council to monitor the Peru-Colombia dispute is composed of representatives from the following countries: (1) Germany, (2) Great Britain, (3) China, (4) Spain, (5) France, (6) Guatemala, (7) Ireland, (8) Italy, (9) Mexico, (10) Norway, (11) Panama, (12) Romania, (13) Czechoslovakia. In addition, it is planned to invite the United States and Brazil to participate in the work of the committee.</p>
<p>Washington, 18th (National News) – Today, the US State Department issued a statement to the press stating that the US government has no objections to the League of Nations' actions in providing a basis for resolving the Leticia dispute between Peru and Colombia, and to the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Yesterday, the League of Nations Administrative Council passed the report of the special committee on the Leticia case, recommending that maintaining the sanctity of existing treaties be the basis for resolution, and organized a 13-nation advisory committee to monitor its progress. At that time, many representatives believed that this move by the League of Nations could be regarded as the end of the Monroe Doctrine. Therefore, the US government issued a statement today to dispel this view, reiterating the US government's attitude towards the Monroe Doctrine, stating that the Monroe Doctrine is clearly a US policy to prevent Europeans from colonizing the Western Hemisphere. The US government has used this policy to prevent Europeans from interfering in the internal affairs of Western Hemisphere countries. Therefore, the Monroe Doctrine cannot be applied to the resolutions of international organizations such as the League of Nations regarding international issues related to member states. Since most Latin American republics are members of the League of Nations, the Monroe Doctrine naturally cannot be applied to the resolutions of the League of Nations. Observers of diplomacy also said that this explanation by the State Department has not changed the US's historical attitude towards the Monroe Doctrine, and is consistent with President Wilson's declaration. Wilson once said that this doctrine only requires European countries not to attempt to expand their political systems to the west of the Atlantic. Former Secretary of the Navy Swanson also stated during the Senate debate on joining the International Court of Justice that the Monroe Doctrine is a US policy, and in practice is a political policy, not international law. As of today, figures from both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress acknowledge that the resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council are not an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Peru and Colombia, nor an attempt to impose European political concepts on these two countries.</p>

<p>Large Sums of Cash Shipped to Italy</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Reuters) – President Roosevelt has approved state authorities to send personnel to manage state banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. These banks can only open after the Treasury Department grants licenses. The list of names of people who withdrew large sums of cash from banks before the bank holiday has been sent to the Federal Reserve, which will review them in detail and then transfer them to the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department is currently drafting regulations to punish hoarders. The proposed measures are said to be quite severe.</p>
<p>New York, 18th (Reuters) – According to information obtained by the financial reporters of the New York American, US cash worth 8.5 million yuan has obtained a special license from the Treasury Department to be shipped to Italy. This cash was withdrawn from reserves long ago and listed in the accounts of Italian banks. This is the first batch of cash shipped out since President Roosevelt's gold ban. Once this precedent is set, foreign gold worth 400 million yuan, currently stored in the vaults of Federal Reserve Banks, may be exported one after another.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 19th (Dentsu) – According to the intentions of the leaders of the Seiyukai regarding the current situation, the current cabinet is a cabinet for extraordinary times, and since its mission has been accomplished, it should resign en masse at an appropriate time after the end of the Diet. It is clear. However, changes in political affairs are difficult to predict, so vigilance is needed. There are movements to continue the current cabinet and movements for the re-emergence of a national unity cabinet. However, these movements are linked to senior statesmen and the Satsuma faction, so they cannot be taken lightly. The Seiyukai rejects such maneuvers, so it is necessary to urge Finance Minister Takahashi and Prime Minister Saito to consider this immediately after the end of the Diet. However, what should be noted at this time is the ominous incident in the Ministry of Justice. If Justice Minister Oyama resigns to take responsibility, then Prime Minister Saito will also resign en masse due to joint responsibility. However, in this matter, Minister of Education Hatoyama also needs to resign due to a certain major incident. However, if Minister of Education Hatoyama resigns due to the incident, it will create a rift in his future political career. Therefore, the Seiyukai, based on Finance Minister Takahashi's active desire to retire, most hopes for a collective resignation. Therefore, the Seiyukai seems to be planning various measures in this regard.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Nichi-Ren) – The term of the current executives of the Seiyukai will expire at the end of this month. The names of the new executives will be announced at the general meeting on the 29th. If the Suzuki cabinet appears after the Diet, the secretary-general will participate in the cabinet formation, and his position is very important. Therefore, all parties are paying attention to who will be the secretary-general. It is said that Toshio Shimada is the most popular.</p>
<h3 id="e98">New Japanese Budget <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Breaks 2.3 Billion</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Dentsu) – The budget for Showa 8 (1933) has reached 2,239 million yen due to the need to spend on urgent Manchurian Incident expenses, military preparation expenses, and situation relief expenses. This is an unprecedentedly huge amount in Japanese financial history. Afterwards, 64 million yen for Manchurian Incident relief funds, Hokkaido disaster relief expenses, naval factory capital replenishment funds, and other temporary necessities were proposed in the supplementary budget. Therefore, the total budget for general accounting is 2,303 million yen, which has been passed by the House of Representatives and will also be passed by the House of Peers within two or three days. However, due to the necessity of emergency measures for the Great Sanriku Earthquake, it is difficult to spend from the reserve fund. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and other related ministries have requested 10 million yen. However, it is difficult to approve the full amount due to the limited time remaining in the session. As a result, half of the amount, 5 million yen, will be approved. If so, the total budget for general accounting for Showa 8 will reach 2,310 million yen.</p>

After returning to China, he served as a professor at Tokyo Imperial University. At the end of the European War, he advocated democracy, rejected militarist autocracy, and strongly condemned the military for abusing its power to destroy democracy and engaging in rampant dual diplomacy. He recently became an opponent of the military, which soon led to his dismissal from his teaching position at Tokyo Imperial University. He then served as an advisor to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, and was again forced to leave by the military due to his essay causing a disrespect charge. Afterwards, he served as a lecturer at Waseda University and as an advisor to the Social Mass Party until his death, being an enemy of Japanese militarists.</p>

<p>Telegram from Zhou – To all newspaper offices, transferred to philanthropists at home and abroad, be advised that the counties of Huangchuan, Guangshan, Shangcheng, Fuli, Huang, and Tongshi in Henan have long suffered from banditry and disaster. The countryside has become a scorched earth, and the refugees after the robbery relied on tree bark and grass roots to barely survive. Although they have repeatedly received generous relief from the government and domestic philanthropists, it is like a drop in the bucket, difficult to be universal. Recently, the spring cold has been unusually severe, and new grass has not yet grown. The need to fill their bellies has become hopeless. Some hang themselves, others starve to death on the roads, and the corpses are piled up in the fields, which is unbearable to see. Even the living are emaciated and difficult to survive. If relief is not urgently provided, I am afraid that they will take risks and the ashes will rekindle. This will not only abandon the achievements of suppressing the bandits, but also affect the overall situation. As the successor to supervising Yuzhong, I witness this with a heavy heart and implore all charitable organizations, kind people, and benevolent people to generously issue compassionate hearts, quickly issue large amounts of relief funds, and allocate grain in batches to urgently relieve and save the hundreds of thousands of refugees in southern Henan who are about to die. I earnestly plead, with endless anticipation. Chen Jicheng, Commander of the First Army and Administrative Supervisor of the Ninth District of Henan, respectfully knocks.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Formation of the New Fascist Cabinet in Germany <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>(German Correspondence) Huang Gongan</p>
<p>New Figures in the New Cabinet</p>
<p>Under the instructions of President Hindenburg, Germany once again produced a new cabinet yesterday (Sunday, January 30, 1933). Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Labor Party, also known as the German Fascist Party, was appointed as the new Prime Minister. Papen, the former Prime Minister who had resigned twice, also made a comeback and was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister and Special Commissioner of the Prussian State Government. The remaining cabinet members were assigned as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Minister: Neurath</p>
<p>Interior Minister: Dr. Frick</p>
<p>Defense Minister: General Blomberg</p>
<p>Finance Minister: Count Schwerin von Krosigk</p>
<p>Minister of Economics, Food and Agriculture: Dr. Hugenberg</p>
<p>Labor Minister: Seldte</p>
<p>Minister of Postal Services and Transport: Eltz von Rübenach</p>
<p>Aviation Minister: Göring</p>
<p>Justice Minister: (Undecided)</p>
<p>With the exception of Foreign Minister Neurath, who is a member of the previous cabinet, all the other members of the new cabinet are newcomers to the political stage and are all extremely right-wing figures who came from the Fascist Nationalistic movement. Left-wing parties such as the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party, as well as the moderate Central Party, were excluded, or refused to cooperate with the right-wing, and had no representatives participating in this cabinet formation. The Social Democratic Party's Forward Daily criticized the cabinet members from a social perspective, saying that they all represent the reactionary forces of big capitalists, big industrialists, big landlords, feudal ideology, and the Fascist united front. In addition, from the perspective of general public opinion, it is generally recognized that the new cabinet is a three-headed cabinet of Hitler, Papen, and Hugenberg. This party is a neutral, objective, and unbiased argument.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Process of Forming the New Cabinet <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The process of forming the new cabinet in Germany was very simple and took less time than usual. President Hindenburg also used political skills to swiftly and resolutely approve the resignation of the Schleicher cabinet and immediately decide to call Hitler to form a cabinet. This was a remarkable achievement. The process of this cabinet change did not cause any political unrest or any major social disturbances. It went smoothly, which is a rare phenomenon in German cabinet changes. Former Prime Minister Schleicher resigned in late January because the new Parliament could not form a majority government, which caused resentment and disappointment among government officials. In addition, the two extreme parties on the left and right in Parliament did not trust or sympathize with Schleicher. On the other hand, since Schleicher took office as Prime Minister, his various policies to address economic panic and unemployment were too passive, and his own political direction was not clearly expressed. The cabinet was in a passive political position, which led to the loss of strong social support and sympathy from political parties. He fought alone and could not hold on, and as a result, he was at a loss. Moreover, the so-called Eastern Aid Plan (a plan to help farmers in East Prussia) lacked a fully satisfactory and active effective design, which especially dissatisfied East Prussian landlords and farmers, leading to attacks on Schleicher and a movement to overthrow the cabinet. In addition, it was heard that Schleicher and Hindenburg's son had disagreements. The environment was bad and he was surrounded by enemies, which made it extremely difficult for the Schleicher cabinet to act. Finally, because Schleicher's proposal to Hindenburg to dissolve the Parliament again was not approved, his policies became increasingly unsuccessful, and he had to submit the cabinet's collective resignation to Hindenburg on January 29. After receiving Schleicher's letter of resignation, Hindenburg, given the Schleicher cabinet's inability to do anything, certainly could not let him stay for a long time and miss the opportunity. Hindenburg immediately approved the resignation. From then on, Schleicher's term as Prime Minister lasted only 75 days. After this cabinet change, the Fascist Party, which had been lurking for a long time, took this opportunity to make a big publicity campaign, unanimously supporting Fascist leader Hitler to take office. At this time, Hindenburg, looking around at the domestic situation, had no other talent in mind to succeed the cabinet other than Hitler. Although Hindenburg clearly knew that Hitler had once competed with him for the presidency and competed with each other, and in fact was a political enemy, it seemed impossible to cooperate or obey. However, President Hindenburg witnessed that the economic panic and suffering were becoming increasingly serious, the unemployment problem was becoming increasingly severe and worsening, and the calls and realities of the left-leaning proletariat revolution were like a raging wind and advancing day by day. Externally, there were issues such as striving for equal international status, war debts, and the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles. The Fascist Party has been making the greatest efforts for this kind of domestic and foreign liberation movement in recent years. Therefore, for the sake of strengthening the entire country and seeking the welfare of the entire nation, Hindenburg had to abandon his past grievances, change his strategy, and establish confidence in good faith. He was willing to work with Hitler to jointly solve Germany's current tense political situation. First, Hindenburg ordered former Prime Minister Papen to come forward and negotiate with right-wing leaders such as Hitler. At that time, Hindenburg also proposed the following cooperation conditions:</p>
<p>(1) Request Hitler to serve as Prime Minister, but on the premise that he abandon his previous advocacy of personal dictatorship.</p>
<p>(2) Require the organization of a national government, broadly including cooperation with the leader of the German National People's Party, Hugenberg, and Papen.</p>
<p>(3) In the future, cabinet policies should abandon the various new economic system experiments of the Fascist Party and implement various new policies under the conditions that they are in line with the wishes of the majority of the people of the country and do not violate the spirit and principles of the Weimar Constitution.</p>
<p>Hitler expressed understanding and willingness to accept these negotiation conditions. As a result, Hitler was appointed as the new Prime Minister on January 30, marking the beginning of a purely right-leaning trend in German politics. At the same time, it also marked the first time the German Fascist Party had set foot on the glorious stage of German politics. Therefore, Hitler's patriotic movement, which he had been running around and calling for for fourteen years, had gone through many hardships, and was difficult to build, and his political ambition can be said to have reached the first step of its goal. Now Hitler can actually show his political skills.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Reflections on Public Opinion at Home and Abroad 0 <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>(1) Influence of Domestic Public Opinion</p>
<p>Since the formal public announcement of the Hindenburg's new three-headed cabinet, it goes without saying that all political parties and newspapers standing on the right-wing front naturally expressed extreme joy and satisfaction, congratulating the right-wing politics for gaining power. Especially the members of the German Fascist Party, since their leader was appointed to the new cabinet, were overjoyed and ecstatic. Members across the country immediately convened extraordinary conferences to celebrate and march, with party members all wearing military uniforms, rampaging through the squares and avenues, their faces filled with seemingly boundless glory. They immediately sent telegrams expressing unanimous support for the new cabinet, vowing that the twelve million Fascist Party members would be Hindenburg's cabinet's rear guard.</p>
<p>But from the left-wing perspective, such as the Democratic Party, the Iron Front, the Free Trade Union, and the Communist Party, the emergence of this three-headed cabinet is seen as the epitome of politics dominated by big capitalists, big landlords, feudal remnants, gentry classes, warlords, militarists, and Fascist dictatorship. In short, it is the great success of the united reactionary forces holding the right-wing (front). This reactionary group has always opposed the interests of workers, promoted capitalism, advocated imperialist policies, practiced dictatorship, undermined democracy, and violated the constitution. Now that they have suddenly leaped onto the political stage and manipulated national power, they will inevitably pose an unfavorable threat or a fatal oppression to the left wing. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining their own survival and the interests of the working class and proletariat, the left-wing front has no choice but to unanimously, resolutely, and actively express opposition to the Hindenburg's new cabinet. The Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag" and the Social Democratic Party's newspaper "Forward" immediately published fierce and powerful declarations attacking the new cabinet, and demanded that workers on the left-wing front hold a national general strike to give the new government and Hindenburg a serious warning with practical actions, and so on. Newspapers standing completely neutral generally believe that the emergence of this new cabinet is the best symbol of coordination between Hindenburg and Hitler, and at the same time, the ultimate success of right-wing compromise, cooperation, and sincere unity in jointly resisting the left-leaning forces. The people, standing on a non-partisan position and taking the overall welfare of the nation as a premise, weighing this new cabinet, can indeed regard it as a fortunate event. We can find this kind of opinion in the "German Gazette." However, the Center Party is unwilling to participate in cooperation with Hindenburg's cabinet and does not express opposition, maintaining a policy of tolerance. Hindenburg once offered the position of Minister of Justice to a member of the Center Party, but the Center Party refused to accept it. The attitude is detached, with a sense of "I am sober while everyone else is drunk," which is really difficult to understand. It is unknown what they are up to.</p>
<p>(2) Repercussions of Foreign Public Opinion</p>
<p>After the emergence of Hindenburg's new cabinet in Germany, the most meaningful impact abroad was in Rome. After receiving the news that Hitler had come to power in Germany and formed a cabinet, Rome believed that the emergence of another Fascist dictatorship comrade in a neighboring country brought immense comfort to Mussolini. All Italian public opinion expressed goodwill towards the new German government. However, France's perception was exactly the opposite of Italy's. After receiving the special telegram that Hitler had come to power in Germany and formed a cabinet, the right-wing newspapers in Paris felt dizzy and bewildered, suffering a great blow and a dangerous threat to their spirits. Although Hitler did not launch a revenge challenge against France, France already felt the seriousness of the security issue. As a result, the right-wing elements in France once again strongly demanded that the government increase the defense budget, and the relations between Germany and France suddenly became very tense again. The Moscow government's unwillingness for the German right wing to be in power was the same as France's, because Fascist nationalism and Slavic internationalism are fundamentally incompatible. Moscow knows that the activities of German Communist Party comrades will not be banned or restricted in the future, so it expresses deep dissatisfaction. In recent years, Britain and the United States have become slightly closer to Germany. There is little discrimination and no dangerous suspicion between each other internationally. Therefore, no matter how German politics changes, it will not have a major direct impact on Britain and the United States. Therefore, the criticism and observation of the emergence of the new German cabinet in London and New York this time is very objective. It is neither as bewildered as France nor as hostile as Soviet Russia. The only greatest and most urgent hope of Britain and the United States is that Germany itself can truly unite, curb the intensification of left-leaning tendencies, and quickly seek to solve the economic panic and restore the normality of international trade, so that Britain and the United States can also suffer less from the world economic panic, so they are very happy about it. Swiss public opinion is also the same as the aforementioned countries, all with a special and unique perspective. For example, the two major Swiss newspapers believe that Hitler's rise to power is the best symbol of the rise of Fascist dictatorship in Germany and the demise of parliamentary democracy (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Situation in North China After Zhang Xueliang's Resignation <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Peiping states that after the fall of Chengde, the situation in North China suddenly became tense. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came north to take charge in order to develop military and diplomatic affairs. He met with Zhang in Baoding, and with Yan in Shijiazhuang, to jointly plan major strategies. He also sent Li Liejun to urge Feng to go to Baoding to discuss everything in person. Because of the change in the situation, Zhang had to resolutely resign to make way for the more capable. After leaving Peiping, the northern situation will be temporarily presided over by He Yingqin, who will serve as the Minister of Military Administration and concurrently as the Chairman of the Peiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission. After He took office, important officials of the Military Affairs Commission, such as Rong Zhen, Wan Fulin, Zhu Guangmu, and Tang Guozhen, resigned one after another. He earnestly retained them all. Except for Zhu and Tang, who left with Zhang and could not be retained, the rest were not changed. Even the lower-level personnel remained as they were, without any reduction or additional appointments. This is because, in the current situation, it is only possible to temporarily maintain the status quo and it is not convenient to make any changes. Yesterday, He ordered the adjutant's office to notify all subordinates to address him as Minister He, and not to honor him as Chairman. From this, He's intentions can be seen.</p>
<p>Since Zhang's resignation, many military and political personnel under the Northeast system have shown their intention to leave. Letters and telegrams of resignation have been coming one after another. Military leaders such as Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Rong Zhen, Wang Yizhe, Shen Honglie, and Bao Yulin have all resigned once. Important political figures such as Zhou Dawen have also expressed their intention to leave. Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin have been urging them to work together to overcome the difficulties during this national crisis. In addition to Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang agreeing in Baoding to reorganize the Northeast Army into four armies, with each taking on the positions of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Army Commanders, the rest are earnestly retained and will never be transferred. The previously determined Commander of the Peiping-Tianjin Garrison, Xu Tingyao, and the Mayor of Peiping, Huang Fu, have been implicitly dismissed. The Northeast military and political personnel believe that although Zhang has resigned, someone is still in charge, and during this difficult time, they should also put the country first and continue to work hard, and wait until this difficult period is over before making further plans. Chiang Kai-shek's meeting in Shijiazhuang was fruitful. It was agreed that the defense and security of the Chahar border would be the responsibility of the Jin-Sui army. It is said that the troops of Fu Zuoyi and Wang Jingguo have entered Chahar Province and the defense is consolidated. It was originally intended to transfer Fu Zuoyi, the Chairman of Suiyuan Province, to Chahar Province, and Wang Jingguo to Suiyuan. However, recently, due to the imminent foreign invasion and the urgency of national salvation, it is not appropriate to make too many internal changes to avoid reducing the external forces. This proposal had to be temporarily shelved. Chiang Kai-shek hopes that Feng Yuxiang can come to Baoding for a talk to discuss major strategies. Li Liejun was ordered to go to Zhangjiakou to meet Feng Yuxiang and convey Chiang Kai-shek's intentions, urging him to go south quickly. However, Feng Yuxiang responded to Chiang Kai-shek's sincere invitation with ambiguous answers, and has not yet prepared to leave Zhangjiakou, probably unwilling to leave Chahar Province easily in order to implement his recent anti-Japanese proposals and is willing to fight the enemy on the front line.</p>
<p>As for diplomacy, since Luo Wengan went north and shuttled between Peiping and Baoding, and consulted with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the ambassadors of various countries, a new development has taken place. The security in the customs may be temporarily maintained. After the Japanese army occupied Rehe, it takes time to deploy, and there is no force to advance south for a while. Recently, it suffered a major setback outside Xifengkou, and its momentum has been reduced. Although the Japanese army still has the determination to obtain it, it has no ability to fight fiercely without new reinforcements. Recently, the Gubeikou area has entered a state of truce. It is said that Mutō has already entered Rehe, with the purpose of preventing the Japanese army from advancing and temporarily taking the Great Wall area as its line of defense. If this is true, the two sides may temporarily form a confrontational situation in the future. (March 17)</p>

After 10:30, some representatives from all walks of life returned early due to martial law. At 11:05, the special train arrived at the station, and the dependents and refugee representatives got off the train and greeted the welcomers, which was quite busy.

The order of getting off the train and sending them was: first the wounded soldiers, then the women, and finally the men. They will all be accommodated in the New World. If that place cannot accommodate them, they will be accommodated in the Xisi Diwang Temple and the Northeast Refugee Relief Institute. It was not until after 1:00 that the transportation was completed. Also, when the train arrived in Tianjin, Zhang Xueming sent 1,200 towels and soaps. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong also sent representatives to the station to express condolences. (March 17)</p>

<p>Office in Jiangxi Moves to Baoding</p>
<p>Led by Qian Dajun Heading North</p>
<p>Responsible for Suppression of Communists in Southwest</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went north the other day, he telegraphed Qian Dajun, the director of the Military Affairs Commission's office in Jiangxi, to lead all the staff of the office north to assist in military operations, as the anti-Japanese military situation is tense. After receiving the order, Qian left Jiangxi on the 15th with the confidential secretary Deng Wenyi, the confidential staff officers, secretaries, adjutants, and personnel from various departments and went to Baoding. All unfinished matters of the headquarters and the military affairs of suppressing bandits in the province were handled by the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian Border Area Bandit Suppression Headquarters, which was headed by Chief of Staff He Guang on an acting basis. The front line was the responsibility of Chen Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the central route. However, when Chiang first came to Jiangxi, the southwest had expressed the hope that Chiang would go north to resist Japan and the southwest would be responsible for suppressing the Communists. Now that Chiang has gone north to supervise the troops, the southwest should fulfill its previous statement. It is said that Chiang's military affairs of suppressing the Communists in the three provinces will be presided over by Chen Jitang. Chen's representative, Li Shangyong, arrived in the province yesterday, and there will be important contacts and discussions on the progress of suppressing the Communists. (March 17)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Jiangxi Troops Recover Jianning <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Fujian and Jiangxi Troops Jointly Suppress Communist Bandits in Border Area</p>
<p>Provincial Government Exempts Taxes in Recovered Bandit Areas</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou states that after the Fujian and Jiangxi troops jointly attacked Jianning and Guangchang, the Guangchang Red Bandits have collapsed and retreated towards Shicheng. The Jianning Red Bandits have also retreated towards Ninghua under its influence. The Jiangxi troops then sent Guo Siyuan's division to pursue from Guangchang to Shicheng, and another division, Zhao Guantao's 6th Division, advanced from Nanfeng towards Jianning, and occupied Jianning County on the 11th. Currently, most of the Red Bandits on the Fujian-Jiangxi border have gathered between the four counties of Ninghua, Changting, Shicheng, and Ruijin, and are building fortifications to resist. Cai Tingkai has transferred Lu Xingbang's division's two brigades, Lu Xingrong and Zhang Xinglong, from Qingliu to advance, Zhang Yan's division's two brigades, Pang Chengyun and Lin, from Liancheng to advance, and Huang Renhuan's division's two brigades, Yan Yingyu and Zeng Youren, from Shanghang to advance, in three routes to attack Ninghua and Changting. At the same time, the Jiangxi troops also sent about five divisions of troops to surround Shicheng and Ruijin to take a pincer attack. Currently, all Fujian troops have reached the front line. In addition, Zhang Zhen's division is stationed in Yongding, Shen Guanghan's division is stationed in Longyan, Qu Shounian's division is stationed in Zhangping, Liu Heding's division is stationed in Tai Ning, Zhou Zhijun's brigade is stationed in Guangze, Qian Yuguang's brigade is stationed in Jian'ou, and Zhang Luanji's brigade is stationed in Pucheng, to take charge of the rear defense of western and northern Fujian, and to support the front line, waiting for the Jiangxi troops to launch a full-scale general attack. However, according to military news, a part of the Red Bandits in Lichuan sneaked into Guangze and Tai Ning again on the 13th, looting wantonly. On the 15th, they had a battle with Zhou Zhijun's and Liu Hezhong's troops, and the artillery fire was quite fierce. Also, the Chong'an Red Bandits and Zhang Luanji's and Qian Yuguang's troops are confronting each other between Chishi in the eastern district and Lan Gu in the western district. As for the provincial government, as the military affairs of suppressing bandits have been progressing rapidly recently, the areas occupied by the bandits have been recovered one after another, and it is urgent to carry out post-war reconstruction to stabilize the people's livelihood. In addition to sending the refugees from the bandit areas who have been wandering in various places back to their hometowns to engage in farming during this spring, the provincial government meeting on the 15th decided to exempt all the old debts and this year's Ding and Zao taxes that should be paid in the recently recovered bandit areas to show sympathy. The administrative expenses of the local government will also be subsidized by the provincial treasury to alleviate the burden. (March 16)</p>

<p>Tenant Farmer Angrily Commits Suicide by Cutting His Throat in the Granary</p>
<p>Dong Yuyu, a resident west of Malu Bridge in this city, had farmland in Qingpu rented to a farmer named Wang Heshang who lived in Shatianbang outside the north gate of Qingpu. Wang Heshang was supposed to pay more than eleven stone of rent. The seeds had already been sent to the granary by Wang Heshang early on. After returning home, he was blamed by his children and daughters-in-law for paying too much and urged him to go to Songjiang to calculate and get it back. Wang Heshang, who was over sixty years old, was filled with anger. Yesterday (the 18th) he came to Songjiang to settle accounts with Dong's granary. The owner of the granary replied that he had not calculated too much and refused his request. The farmer was unable to return home, so he borrowed lodging there. At noon today, he borrowed five hundred cash from Dong, pretending to buy snacks to fill his stomach. He returned after a while and said he was dizzy. He went upstairs to take a nap, but secretly used a pointed foot knife to cut his throat on the right side. Blood flowed all over the bed. When someone noticed, it was too late to save him, and he died. It was about 2:00 pm. The knife used for suicide was probably the one he borrowed money to buy outside. After the incident, the Public Security Bureau and the Procuratorate of the Court were notified to request an inspection, and people were sent to the village to report to his family.</p>

<p>Since the organization of the Aircraft Donation Fundraising Committee from all walks of life, donations have not been enthusiastic. It was decided to hold a mass propaganda campaign at the auditorium of the People's Education Hall at 1:00 pm today (the 19th). Representatives from various agencies and the entire student body of the school attended, and the public also participated enthusiastically. After the chairman of the county party committee led the ceremony, he gave a speech on the importance of the air force as a weapon to defeat the enemy.

<p>The sixth elementary school of Shishangwan County in the northern countryside of this county has more than 360 students. Recently, due to the rampant behavior of the Japanese invaders and the deepening national crisis, they have been saving money on candy and donating to the national salvation fund for aviation. Senior students donate four corners of a dollar per person, and junior students donate two corners of a dollar per person. Together with the savings of the school teachers, the amount is considerable.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Xiaosi Alley outside the north gate of this county, Cai Yuxing's steamer shop, which was opened by Cai Kaiyu, and the landlord Qian Zixuan, whose family runs a paper horse business, had a total of three buildings. The tenants Pan Achun (who opened Pan Wanxing's bamboo basket shop), Zhu Xueming (who opened Zhu Yishun's gluten shop), Zhu Yubao (who opened Zhu Hengtai's foreign goods shop), and Wang Jin's and Wang Ating's mother and son, a total of fifteen or sixteen men and women, all lived upstairs and downstairs. Yesterday morning (the 19th) at about 2:00, a fire suddenly broke out in the building, causing a fire. The fire immediately broke through the roof. Zhu Yubao's wife, Leng, their son Lingzhu, and Wang Jin's son, Ating, were burned to death because they could not escape. The fire brigades of each section heard the alarm and drove dragons to the scene, drawing water to extinguish the fire. It took two hours to put out the fire. A total of three buildings in the back were burned down. The burned corpses have been dug out of the rubble, charred and unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Robbery Case in Xiaochuan Bay</p>
<p>In the Xiaochuan Bay area near Dahe Town in the ninth district, there is a farmer named Cai Yongjia who is quite wealthy. Fearing that he would be coveted by bandits, he dug a cave underground to hide his silver, hoping to be discreet. Unexpectedly, three robbers armed with kitchen knives and iron rulers came to Cai's house to rob him the night before. They tied up Yongjia, used a hook to hook his nostrils, and forced him to ask where the silver was hidden. Although Cai firmly refused to reveal it, he was eventually searched and more than 2,000 yuan were robbed.</p>

<p>President Wang told reporters that the position of President of the Executive Yuan involves numerous affairs and heavy responsibilities. Due to his incomplete recovery, he is unable to handle the workload. Forcing himself to take on the role might lead to incompetence and harm the country. Although various parties have strongly urged him to resume his duties, he still maintains his previous stance and hopes that President Song will be officially appointed. As for whether or not he will go north, he will decide after arriving in Beijing.</p>

Regarding the matter of Wang's resumption of the presidency of the Executive Yuan, Wang has been persuaded by various parties in Shanghai for days, and his intentions have already been swayed. It is likely that a final decision will be made after meeting with Chiang.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Fierce Battles Imminent on the Front Lines <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Defeated at Xifengkou Reinforced</p>
<p>Our Troops on High Alert</p>
<p>People Urged to Quickly Raise Relief Funds</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan's Urgent Telegram: The Shanghai Northeast Relief Association received a telegram from Zhu Ziqiao stating, "Gentlemen of all associations, after the enemy's disastrous defeat at Xifengkou, they have been bombing our positions with large numbers of aircraft for days to contain us. Meanwhile, they have been rapidly advancing and fiercely attacking our Luowenyu positions with a mixed brigade or more of troops, attempting to disrupt our rear. Commander Liu Ruming of Song's division led three regiments to counterattack, resulting in a fierce battle lasting all day and night. The enemy concentrated its firepower with artillery and planes, bombing our army with dozens of aircraft, but our troops remained steadfast. Subsequently, Commander Liu, with bare arms and holding a saber, led his troops to charge the enemy, killing four to five hundred men, breaking through two lines of enemy defenses, capturing enemy officers and soldiers, and seizing many guns, cannons, and bullets. A small number of the enemy fled, and the majority were annihilated. They are now increasing reinforcements, aiming to capture Xifengkou, and a fierce battle is imminent. The front lines lack supplies, and the bloody battles are almost without resources. The casualties among officers and soldiers also await relief. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel extremely saddened. Your patriotic hearts are undoubtedly even more fervent than mine. I implore you to quickly raise substantial funds, gather a large quantity of medicine, and transport them quickly to the front lines to meet the urgent needs. This is my sincere hope." Zhu Qinglan bows urgently.</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's Urgent Telegram: The Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and the Shanghai Northeast Refugee Relief Association received a telegram dated the 16th from Sun Kuiyuan stating, "I have just received a telegram from our army's office in Peiping, and I thank you for the consolation money of ten thousand yuan. At this time of national crisis and financial hardship, our army is defending the country, which is our duty. Your comrades have gathered contributions, showing deep patriotism, and I am deeply grateful for your generous assistance. In the future, we will continue to strive to live up to your kindness. We will notify you separately upon receipt of the funds. I respectfully wish you all the best. Sun Kuiyuan, Commander of the Forty-first Army, bows. Sun also telegraphed Zhang Youqun, his representative in Shanghai, saying, 'Brother Youqun, I have received your telegram. Our army has been fighting hard for over ten days, and we are in dire straits. Not only are we running out of ammunition, but we are also severely lacking in provisions, medicine, and footwear. The dead are gone, and the wounded have no medicine for treatment. Eighty to ninety percent of the soldiers are in single layers of clothing and barefoot. We are fighting alone with no assistance. I hope you can contact various parties to provide our army with material assistance. I will now describe the recent battle situation again. At dawn yesterday, two enemy tanks, over ten armored vehicles, three hundred cavalry, and over a thousand infantry attacked the defense line of Xie's regiment at Liangdi Xing. After three hours of fierce fighting, they were bravely repulsed by our forces. Due to the deep snow of half a foot on the cold night, the enemy's armored vehicles were ineffective. We captured two armored vehicles and two mountain cannons, killing over a hundred enemies. According to captured enemies, each armored vehicle carries a mountain cannon, eight gunners, four light machine guns, and fifty shells. The Japanese bandits all use light machine guns, while the Mongols and defecting soldiers use rifles. They use cavalry to push the tanks and launch a fierce attack on all levels of command, with infantry continuing the attack. In this battle, our army lost two company commanders, four platoon leaders, three wounded platoon leaders, over fifty soldiers killed, and over seventy wounded. At dawn yesterday, about seven to eight hundred enemy cavalry attacked our left flank at Digoumen from Zhang Sanying. Our vehicles calmly fired, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy retreated. We estimate that we killed over seventy enemy horses and captured three or four. Our army lost one platoon leader, eight soldiers killed, and thirteen soldiers wounded. In this battle, over a hundred enemies were killed. There have been no battles on the front lines today. According to intelligence, the enemy is gathering about ten thousand infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and over thirty tanks in the Zhang Sanying Tang Sanying area. I expect there will be a fierce battle tomorrow and the day after. In addition to ordering all units on the front lines to be on high alert, I am sending you this telegram. Sun Kuiyuan sealed.'"</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing's Two Telegrams: Pan Yunchao, Director of the Shanghai Communications Office of the Northeast National Salvation Army Command Headquarters, received two telegrams from the headquarters yesterday as follows: (1) "Chen Lianfu, regimental commander of the [number] regiment of the [number] division of the Northeast National Salvation Army, upon receiving an order from Zhu Jiqing, led his division from a certain place to rush to the [blank] defense between Lengkou and Xifengkou to cooperate with a certain unit of the National Army in combat. Li Dianlin's unit of the [number] regiment is also under orders to prepare for mobilization." (2) "Telegram from the front lines on March 17: (1) The enemy stopped construction of the light railway from Jinchaolu Koubeiyingzi to Chaoyang County six days ago. (2) The enemy is transporting supplies from Chaoyang towards Chifeng, closer to Jianping and further back from Dahushan by ninety li compared to before. (3) The Daling River is currently thawing, making movement to the east and west inconvenient. We need to wait another two weeks for it to be passable."</p>

<p>Aviation National Salvation Movement</p>
<p>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a reception was held at the Atlantic Restaurant to welcome the leaders of various fundraising teams for the Shanghai-style aircraft committee. Over two hundred team leaders and deputy team leaders from various industries attended.</p>
<p>Attending Team Leaders included representatives from the following: Jihe Yarn Factory, Nei Wai Cotton Mill, Ink Makers Union, Liang Industry Union, Medical Industry Union, Sanshan Shanghai-Based Yangwu Industry Association, District 1 Sanitation Workers Union, District 5 Cotton Spinning Union, Mercerizing Office, Municipal Toothbrush Industry Union, District 6 Cotton Weaving Union, District 6 Water and Electricity Workers Union, Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 2, District 3 Water and Electricity Industry Union, China Merchants Electricity Association, District 4 Silk Reeling Union, Hua Cheng Office, Nanyang Tobacco Factory Union, Slice Industry Union, Dock Workers, Municipal Cured Meat Industry Union, Shoemaking Industry Union, Dried Goods Union, Shanghai West Tongxing Yarn Factory, Pig Bristle Industry Union, Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 6, Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 4, Electricity Company, Humi Union, Umbrella Industry Union, District 1 Rubber Industry Union, District 1 Shipbuilding Industry Union, District 6 Public Transportation Workers Union, Qinglan Office, Military Uniform Industry Union, Brewing Industry Union, Civilian Ship Timber Industry Union, District 3 Cotton Spinning Industry Union, District 3 Cotton Spinning Branch Office No. 1, Jewelry Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Cabin Workers Union, District 9 Soap and Medicine Industry Union, Municipal Coal Industry Union, District 1 Transport and Lighterage Industry Union, Fresh Pork Office, District 5 Loading and Unloading Industry Union, Municipal Leather Making Industry Union, Municipal Hotel and Reception Industry Union, District 4 Transport and Lighterage Industry Union, District 4 Cigarette Rolling Union, Lithography Union, Nei Wai Cotton Mill No. 5, Inland Steamboat Union, Postal Workers Union, Garment Making Union, Ferry Union, District 4 Rubber Industry Union, District 10 Cotton Spinning Union, Gas Industry Union, Steamboat Timber Industry Union, Pharmacy Union, Match Industry Union, Postal Workers Union, District 6 Tea Making Union, Silk Factory, and other industry team leaders, totaling over two hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Zhu Xuefan reported on the significance of the reception for the team leaders, stating that the enthusiastic participation of the labor community in the Aviation National Salvation Movement demonstrates that the spirit of the people is not dead and that something can be accomplished. Fundraising has already begun in Shanghai's labor circles, and one hundred and twenty-four teams from various industries have registered. Even though dock workers and silk factory workers do not have union organizations, they have automatically participated. With such enthusiasm from our labor community, the Shanghai Labor Aircraft will soon soar into the sky. With the recent urgency of the war on the front lines, soldiers are resisting a powerful enemy with flesh and blood, making donations even more pressing. We hope that all team leaders will actively engage in this endeavor so that we can see its success soon.</p>
<p>Lu's Speech: Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, then gave a speech, stating that he was attending as a worker and that the national crisis requires all citizens to act according to their conscience to save the country. The people of the Northeast have already suffered a life of subjugation, and to avoid becoming the next Northeast, we must urgently rise up to save ourselves. With Rehe already lost and Tianjin and Peiping in danger, the international community is currently preoccupied and unable to assist us. The Japanese are taking advantage of this opportunity to carry out large-scale aggression. Our only way out is to unite and resist Japan. Since this is a scientific war, we need to donate to purchase aircraft. Our workers are willing to contribute their sweat and wages to alleviate the national crisis, which demonstrates the character of our workers and brings honor to the labor community, and can also inspire wealthy households to join the national crisis. Li Yongxiang then gave a speech with much encouragement.</p>
<p>Representative's Report: Shao Xubai, a representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions who was sent to comfort the soldiers on the front lines, reported on the situation, stating that he represented the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in joining the Shanghai delegation to comfort the soldiers on the front lines, departing north on the 2nd. After arriving in Tianjin, he transferred to Qinhuangdao to comfort the soldiers under He Zhuguo. The morale of the soldiers was extremely high, and they had built solid defense works in the Haiyangzhen area, facing the Japanese army in a tense standoff. The generals and soldiers all expressed their willingness to sacrifice everything to resist the brutal enemy, but they lacked heavy trucks and anti-aircraft guns, hoping for assistance from the rear. The next day, they arrived in Peiping and originally planned to go to Chengde, but due to Rehe retreating without a fight, they were unable to do so. They then planned to go to Gubeikou for inspection, but due to the vehicles being used for military transport, they were unable to fulfill their wish. They then changed their plans to visit the military hospital to comfort the wounded soldiers. Although the soldiers were groaning in pain, they were mostly full of spirit. The most tragic was a soldier who died due to severe injuries. As he was dying, he shouted "Charge and kill the enemy!" His sacrifice was so heroic that all the representatives were moved. I hope that our comrades in the labor community will unite and enthusiastically support the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>Temporary Proposals: After the report, Xu Yangong, a representative of the Dyeing Industry Union, proposed that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions telegraph Chairman Chiang to order the soldiers on the front lines to only advance and not retreat, and that the people in the rear would do their best to donate funds for relief. Liu Jintai also proposed that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions submit a proposal to the Party and government agencies to collect two months' rent from the Chinese concession to be used as aviation donations. Both proposals were unanimously passed and accepted by the chairman for the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to handle.</p>

Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency interviewed them at their hotel, asking about the current situation in Mongolia and their mission in Shanghai. They replied in detail as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e132">Inner Mongolian Leagues and Banners <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Mongolia is divided into Inner and Outer Mongolia. Outer Mongolia has long been independent and is temporarily unrelated to the Central Government, so we will not discuss it for now. Inner Mongolia originally had six leagues, two independent banners, and two special departments. Each league has a different number of banners under its jurisdiction. The six leagues have a total of fifty-three banners. Including the independent banners and special departments, there are a total of fifty-seven banners, located in the western parts of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, and the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The total population is approximately five million.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Half Already Lost <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has fallen, and the Jerim League and Hulunbuir Special Department of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as well as the Ikmingan Independent Banner, have come under Japanese influence. With the fall of Rehe this year, the Juu Uda and Shilingol Leagues are also under enemy cavalry. Only the Xilingol, Ulaanchab, and Ih Juu Leagues and the Chahar Special Department, as well as the Tümed Independent Banner, remain within the borders of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Mongolian Attitude <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Although the leagues and banners in the three northeastern provinces have fallen to the enemy cavalry and are unable to resist due to the disparity in power, the Mongols' attitude towards Japan is extremely firm. The Japanese originally intended to organize a Manchurian-Mongolian puppet state, but because no Mongols were willing to be used, they were unable to realize it and only established the "Manchukuo." Later, representatives of the princes and nobles of the leagues and banners, aware of the crisis of the Japanese invasion of Rehe and Hebei, jointly went to Beijing in December of last year to petition for a plan to reorganize Inner Mongolia. The Central Government was also very concerned and expressed its sympathy.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Discord Between Top and Bottom <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The highest organ in the Central Government in charge of Mongolian affairs is the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, but those who preside over the commission are unaware of the situation in Mongolia and seem indifferent to the rise and fall of Inner Mongolia. The suggestions of the representatives of the princes and nobles of the leagues and banners were shelved without any progress. Before and after the fall of Rehe this year, the leagues and banners also sent telegrams reporting and making suggestions, but they were all kept in the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Therefore, although the leagues and banners are grateful to the Central Government, they are disappointed that Mongolian affairs have not improved.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Petitioning Wang <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>We have come to Shanghai this time to welcome Mr. Wang Jingwei and to petition the Central Government to improve Mongolian policy, reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and eliminate the current state of [missing character] and to ensure that local opinions can reach the Central Government in order to bridge the gap. We met with Wang yesterday, and Wang expressed his strong approval.</p>
<h3 id="e137">League and Banner Organization <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Although half of the leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia have fallen, the rest are also bordering war zones and are very dangerous. However, their attitude towards Japan is extremely firm, and they are unwilling to be subjugated. The league and banner system is a military organization. The basic unit is the Zuǒ, and the Zuǒlǐng commands five hundred able-bodied men. Four Zuǒ make up a Jia, with a Canlǐng. Each banner includes a different number of Jia, ranging from six or seven to over ten. The league is the annual meeting [missing character] of the banners, purely for military purposes. They also have considerable modern weapons and can be used.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Outer Mongolian Progress <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Inner and Outer Mongolia are originally the same ethnic group, and their religions and customs are completely the same. Outer Mongolia has been independent for many years, and the government has always wanted to appease them, but this can only be effective after Inner Mongolia has a solution. Liu Zhanyi went to Outer Mongolia twice in 1924 and 1928 for investigation, and its politics, economy, and culture are thriving, showing the atmosphere of a new country. In contrast, Inner Mongolia is gradually declining. It is difficult to advocate for Outer Mongolia to return, and we sincerely hope that the Central Government will actively improve Inner Mongolia's administration as a foundation for recovering Outer Mongolia.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Wang Delin and His Family to Come to Shanghai <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 166 People</p>
<p>Zhang Chuyu, the Shanghai representative of Wang Delin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Righteous Army of Heilongjiang Province, told a Far Eastern News Agency reporter yesterday that Wang Delin's family members departed from Dalian by ship on the 17th and will arrive in Shanghai within days. He also received a telegram from Commander Wang through Liang Yuanshan, the representative stationed in Beiping, requesting all agencies to assist in taking care of them. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Recently, on the 16th of this month, I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Wang Delin stating: "Since the Japanese pirates have acted recklessly and established a puppet state, they have plundered the beautiful name of national self-determination and confused the world's audience. Are the descendants of the Chinese people willing to accept such humiliation? The people are aroused by righteous indignation and vow to resist to the death. Delin, awaiting punishment at the end of the military ranks, dares not lag behind. After years of bloody battles, we have killed more than ten thousand enemies, shattering the Japanese's deceptive lies. International public opinion has seen through their treachery. Since the national consciousness is known to all, Delin and others, though living in displacement and hardship, do not consider it bitter but rather sweet. Previously, due to the exhaustion of ammunition, I could not bear to let the women and children of the army perish with us, so I instructed them to temporarily enter Russian territory to await resettlement. Fortunately, the central government provided relief and sent ships to Vladivostok to welcome them back to the country. Surviving the tiger's mouth and seeing the glory of the Central Plains again is indeed a great fortune amidst misfortune. Recalling the compatriots trapped by the enemy, forced by violence, their laughter and tears are not their own, I feel even more urgently the responsibility of rescue. This time, returning to the country, there are a total of 188 wounded soldiers, women, and children. I have specially dispatched Zhao Shenyuan and Qu Tingfu to escort them on the ship southward. I have also telegraphed Representative Liang Yuanshan to make arrangements for their care in advance. The ship will transfer from Tianjin to Shanghai and is expected to arrive soon. I fear that they are unfamiliar with the place and that some unscrupulous individuals may take the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, the headquarters has issued certificates of identification, which they will hold separately, so that local officials can verify them at any time to avoid confusion. After landing, I earnestly request all charitable organizations and national salvation institutions to consider our displacement for the sake of the country and make proper arrangements for resettlement. If each of them can find their place, then the guarding officers and soldiers will be free from family burdens and will be more determined to kill the enemy and die for the country. This is specially communicated, respectfully requesting your kind attention." Upon receiving this telegram, it was found that there are 144 women and children, 25 men, and 19 wounded soldiers among the families of our army's generals, totaling 188 people. Except for the 19 wounded soldiers who will go to Beiping for medical treatment and the 11 family members of Brigade Commander Zhenxing who will come to Beiping, the remaining 166 family members will go directly to Shanghai. Accordingly, a telegram is sent to Shanghai agencies, requesting them to make extraordinary efforts to take care of them and ensure that they do not suffer from cold and hunger. This is our earnest hope."</p>

<p>Capture of Nanjiang</p>
<p>Wang Yate, the Shanghai representative of the Border Region Bandit Suppression Supervisor's Office of Sichuan and Shaanxi Provinces, received a telegram from Tian Songyao stating, "Limited time to arrive. Shanghai, Wang Shuxian, my brother. I have just received a report from the front-line Commander-in-Chief Sun Zhen, forwarded by Wang Mingzhang, Commander of the Left Column, and Liu Hanxiong, Division Commander, stating: Since our Li Juntao, Yang Xuanfu, and Tan Shike's three brigades and Hu and Zhang's two regiments captured Shikong Dam and Fengjia Mountain from Daheitan, they pursued the bandits to the Golden Bridge, thirty miles away from Nanjiang County. The Red bandits relied on the dangerous terrain of Shitun and Pingyiliang to stubbornly resist. After the brave attacks of the Li and Yang brigades, from Chen to Wei (7 AM to 3 PM), they fought and charged, followed by hand-to-hand combat, killing many bandits. Taking advantage of the victory, they captured Nanjiang at 2 PM. The bandits fled in disorder towards Daxiao Village and Zengzi Field. They seized a large number of guns, horses, and luggage. Before fleeing, the bandits dragged away all men and women under the age of forty and massacred more than a thousand innocent people, which was extremely cruel. In addition to ordering officers and soldiers at all levels to maintain the determination that only one side can survive, and continue to pursue and suppress them, I specially communicate this to you. Tian Songyao, seal."</p>

<p>Wartime Women's Service Training Class</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Requests Support Association to Allocate Funds to Help It Succeed</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Mayor Wu Tiecheng yesterday, along with the initiation charter of the Wartime Women's Service Training Class organized by the Women's Association, requesting financial assistance. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Wu's Letter <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng's letter to the Support Association states: "I am writing to inform you that the war in the Northeast is becoming increasingly tense. It is difficult to predict how long the military situation will last or to what extent it will extend. The people of the country, united in mind and cooperating to fight the enemy, should make practical preparations to save themselves in order to achieve victory. The Chinese Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots is a powerful women's organization in our city. It has provided a great deal of donations and military supplies to the front lines. Now, the association plans to establish a Wartime Women's Service Training Class to train talents for long-term struggle, which is extremely important. However, the total cost of the military expenditure is six thousand yuan. Besides the association's responsibility to raise half of the amount, there is still a shortage of three thousand yuan. I have always admired your association's enthusiasm for saving the country and not lagging behind. Therefore, I have copied the initiation and charter of the association's Wartime Women's Service Training Class. I would like to request your association to allocate one thousand yuan to help its establishment. I hope that you will grant this request, and I will be extremely grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e143">Initiation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The initiation of the Wartime Women's Service Training Class, established by the Chinese Women's Relief Association for Northeastern Compatriots, states: "Since the fall of Yuguan and the danger to Beiping and Tianjin, the ambition of the brutal Japanese to annex China has become increasingly obvious. The future world situation is becoming more and more dangerous. The continuation of the current Sino-Japanese dispute is a harbinger of international war in the future. At that time, wars will be frequent and casualties are expected to be heavy. In the past European wars, the service of women in the rear was already remarkable. Today, the Japanese warlords have not only armed the youth of the whole country but also trained women. At this critical juncture of life and death in our country, if we do not quickly catch up and intensify preparations, we may not be able to find the time and opportunity to train women to participate in wartime services in the future. The original purpose of our association was to raise funds to help Northeastern refugees. However, as the recovery of the Northeast is uncertain and the Japanese continue to invade, it seems insufficient to only engage in passive relief. It is better to plan for active preparations for resisting the invasion, so as to take both into consideration and increase the effectiveness and sustainability. Therefore, we have specially passed the suggestion of Mr. He Xiangning to establish this training class, in order to train a part of enthusiastic and patriotic young women for the needs of long-term anti-Japanese resistance in the future. We hope that leaders from all walks of life and compatriots throughout the country will give material and spiritual support. This is our great hope."</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association telegraphed Sun Dianying yesterday: "General Sun Dianying: Zhang Junyouqun has returned to Shanghai and we have met and discussed everything in detail. We understand your situation. After a meeting last night, it was decided to reallocate 100,000 rounds of ammunition from the original allocation to Zhu Qing's unit to meet the urgent needs of your army. In addition, 5,000 yuan will be allocated for relief, and more than 2,000 cotton blankets and cotton underwear are being processed. As soon as they are ready, they will be sent to your army.

<p>Telegraphed Song Zheyuan yesterday: "Beiping, General Song Mingxuan: Since the fall of Chengde, the people have been shocked. The retreat from Rehe without a fight has fueled the enemy's arrogance, resulting in the loss of land and humiliation of the country, which is regrettable. Thinking of this, we feel heartbroken. You lead brave soldiers, hold the key passes, raise your arms and point your blades at the invaders, and defeat the enemy, which is inspiring the whole country. If the national army on the entire Great Wall line, as well as the troops in Chahar and Dolun, can all act together and launch a counterattack at the same time, like the officers and soldiers of your army, fighting bravely and killing the enemy, not only can Rehe be recovered within a time limit, but also Liaoyang can be taken directly and the Japanese can be swept away. Now that the enemy's plot is underway and the war is urgent, we still hope that your army will continue to work hard and fight with the Japanese to achieve extraordinary feats and win the final victory to restore our country. Our association is willing to do our best and serve as a supporter. We specially send this telegram of encouragement and look forward to hearing good news.

<p>To Advance and Retreat with the Anti-Japanese Troops</p>
<p>According to news from the local post office, since the fall of Chengde, the post offices in Rehe Province have either been occupied by the Japanese army or have stopped operating. Now, in order to ensure the rapid transmission of news about the war, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications have specially ordered the post offices to establish temporary post offices within the anti-Japanese troops in the Rehe border region, to advance and retreat with the army, and to establish close contact. The procedures will be followed in accordance with the precedent of the postal blockade in the Northeast. After receiving the order, the post office has instructed the postal staff remaining in Rehe to quickly organize and establish them to facilitate military operations.</p>

<p>Request to Amend Import Tax on Newspapers</p>
<p>Change from Specific Duty to Ad Valorem Duty</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "Submission Regarding a Request. It was found that on the 18th of this month, we received a letter from the Paper Industry Association stating that according to the import newspaper tax rate No. 513 of Category 10 promulgated by the National Government on December 29, 1930, (A) rolled paper is taxed at 1.5 yuan in customs gold per picul, and (B) other (i.e., packed) paper is taxed at 1.6 yuan in customs gold per picul. Later, in November 1932, the rolled newspaper was changed to 7.5% ad valorem, which was promulgated. It is found that the current price of each ton of newspaper in the market is about 86 yuan in customs gold. Calculated at 7.5% ad valorem according to item (A) of No. 513, the tax should be 6.45 yuan in customs gold. According to item (B), which is 1.6 yuan in customs gold per picul, each ton should be taxed at 26.88 yuan in customs gold, which is four times the difference. It is found that rolled paper is mostly used by large newspaper offices such as Shenbao and Xinwenbao, which have strong capital and complete equipment. Packed paper is mostly used by small newspaper offices in this and other cities with small capital for printing news and by bookstores for printing textbooks and books and magazines. The same goods, both necessities for cultural promotion, have different tax rates, which is not fair. Therefore, we hereby report this in writing and request your association to examine and approve this and forward it to the Tariff Commission of the National Government to amend the newspaper tax rate (A) and (B) of No. 513 in Category 10 to generally collect 7.5% ad valorem to avoid unevenness and eliminate abuses. It is a matter of public convenience. It was sent to the association. It is found that the import of newspapers is a cultural dissemination tool, and the tax should not be too high. In November of last year, it was stipulated that it should be 7.5% ad valorem, which is the purpose. However, the rolled newspaper has been changed to ad valorem tax, while the packed newspaper is still subject to specific duty. The same newspaper, but the packed newspaper is four times more taxed than the rolled newspaper, which is disadvantageous to the cultural industry with smaller capital. Therefore, it is necessary to correct it. It is reasonable to submit the matter in writing and request your department to examine and approve the change of the import tax of item B of No. 513 to ad valorem tax of 7.5% like item A, so as to eliminate prejudice and achieve public convenience."</p>

<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Industry: "The telegram has been received.

<p>The case of the division of educational property between Shanghai City and Shanghai County has been drafted and various solutions have been proposed. Therefore, the City Education Bureau sent a letter to the County Government requesting a date to jointly handle the handover procedures. After the County Government approved the letter, it immediately decided to transfer four-tenths of the ten mu and two fen and four li and five hao of the old school base to the city, which will be handled by the County Education Bureau. In addition, four-tenths of the base near Panfang will be transferred by the Property Management Office. The houses in the office were originally built by the Property Management Office. The county should receive 37%, which will be purchased by the city. The Property Management Office will estimate the price. The County Government has informed the City Education Bureau to schedule the handover procedures at 10:00 AM on March 20 (today) at the County Education Bureau on Shangwen Road.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Public Concession <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Sanitary Conditions for the Previous Year</p>
<p>Liang Zhou Dengbo, the head of the Sanitation Department of the Public Works Department, reported on the 1932 fiscal year: "The public health conditions for this fiscal year, apart from the outbreak of cholera, were exceptionally good. The total number of deaths among foreign residents was only 567, which is 12.82 per thousand of the total population of 44,240. The previous year it was 17 per thousand, and the year before that it was 18.15 per thousand. The number of deaths among Chinese residents was 18,189, which is 17.65 per thousand of the total population of 1,032,0554. The previous year it was 16.71 per thousand, and the year before that it was 16.42 per thousand. The reason why this is higher may be that during the disturbances in this city, those who were seriously ill and returned to their hometowns at ordinary times could not go back at this time, so there were more deaths within the boundary. However, this report is still mostly incomplete, so its ratio is not accurate. As for cholera, although it was prevalent for a time, the total number of residents who died from this disease was only 162."</p>
<h3 id="e153">Infectious Diseases <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The most important infectious disease this year was cholera, which reached its epidemic period at the end of April and disappeared after September 23. A total of 44 foreign patients were reported, and 13 died from it. 1544 Chinese patients were reported, and 149 died. Therefore, although the epidemic was severe, the number of deaths was not too large. After the epidemic started, chlorine gas disinfection was carried out in wells everywhere, and free clean water was supplied to residents in certain areas. At the same time, compulsory vaccination was carried out. According to the investigation, there is no real relationship between water wells and cholera, because most of the wells in the concession are not for drinking. Their existence may only be for feng shui reasons. Also, the spread of cholera does not coincide with the rise and fall of flies. In short, how this disease is transmitted is still difficult to say for sure. In addition to cholera, only smallpox and measles were slightly prevalent at the beginning of the year, and there is nothing much to pay attention to. In the past year, 200,210 people were vaccinated against cholera and 262,475 were vaccinated against smallpox.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Hospital Relocation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese conflict broke out at the beginning of the year, the locations of the bureau-run hospitals were quite dangerous, and they were temporarily moved urgently. A total of five hospitals were moved to six locations. One of the largest was a warehouse, which was not prepared at all, but after three days, the layout was gradually completed. When moving, the procedures for moving patients and bedding were complicated, and the supervision could not be thorough. However, the patients were never affected, which shows the training and enthusiasm of the nursing staff. The loyalty of the low-level Chinese staff, who are not paid much, is especially commendable.</p>

<p>Since January, hotels and public facilities in the central district have become increasingly crowded with refugees. Smallpox and other diseases were spreading, and measures were taken to prevent them. However, supervision was not easy. Later, refugee shelters were established one after another, totaling 85, accommodating more than 44,000 refugees. There were also 26 wounded soldier hospitals, and the sanitation work was a heavy burden for the sanitation staff.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Veterinary Work <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The work of the veterinary section is becoming increasingly heavy. Fortunately, at the beginning of this year, a Chinese veterinarian was added, so that systematic lung examinations could be carried out on dairy cows. Buffalo meat is now gradually under management, but goat meat has not yet been started due to religious reasons, and it needs to be carried out carefully. The method of eliminating diseased meat is now satisfactory.</p>
<p>As a result of the previous redistribution of personnel in small food shops, most of the small food shops are now also under management. Regarding the candies sold in these shops, some of which contained toxic pigments, after the crackdown, the larger shops have improved. However, the very small shops may not yet know the advantages and disadvantages. The results of this work are still satisfactory, but their effectiveness is not obvious.</p>
<p>School Inspections The sanitary conditions of some schools receiving subsidies from the bureau have been paid attention to. Because the number of sanitation staff has not increased, the initial inspections have not been completely satisfactory. Thanks to the Education Committee's power to grant and withhold, the situation has improved in most cases where the situation was particularly bad. However, this work is only a beginning today.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Dredging the Middle Section of the Puzhao River in Western Shanghai <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Puhuitang Has Also Started Construction</p>
<p>The Caobing Outflow Changes from Longhua Port</p>
<p>Insufficient Dredging Funds Planned to Be Raised Again</p>
<p>Dredging the Puzhao River in Western Shanghai, the project is divided into three sections. The western section, which is already under construction, is under the jurisdiction of Songjiang and Qingpu counties, starting from Longzhu Temple in the west of Qibao Town and ending at Jiepai Bridge. The middle section starts from Jiepai Bridge to Tianyao Bridge, and has now been rerouted to Caobing Port and out of Longhua Port. The Municipal Works Bureau invited merchants to bid. The lowest bid price was 111,006 yuan, plus bridge and miscellaneous expenses, totaling more than 120,000 yuan. Because the funds, in addition to the 70,000 yuan allocated by the Post-War Committee of the Songhu War Zone, only had 30,000 yuan raised by Chen Yafu, a municipal commissioner in the Pusong area, and Cao Shen Yang Xinzheng, for a total of only 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the Municipal Works Bureau reduced the items one by one to more than 80,000 yuan, which, with the addition of bridge construction fees and office expenses, was just enough to reach 100,000 yuan. However, local people believe that the river has not been dredged for 24 years. If it is done sloppily and the bottom of the river is not dredged deeply, it will gradually silt up again after a few years. In order to seek a permanent solution, it is proposed to ask Chen Yafu and Yang Xinzheng to request the municipal authorities to raise funds for the shortfall and not approve the reduction. Now, on the one hand, dams are being built at both ends and dredging machines are being used to dredge. On the other hand, efforts are being made to raise funds again. The eastern section from Tianyao Bridge to Rihui Port has also been bid by the Municipal Works Bureau. The lowest bid price is 67,358.47 yuan. In addition to the 30,000 yuan allocated by the Post-War Committee of the Songhu War Zone, the French Public Works Bureau also subsidizes 15,000 taels of silver, which is about 21,000 yuan. The remaining shortfall will be raised by the Public Works Bureau, so construction can also begin soon.</p>

The Shanghai-Songjiang motor road, which used to require changing vehicles at the border with Songjiang at the bridge, is now being rebuilt with a reinforced concrete bridge. The project has passed halfway and will be open to traffic within half a month. In the future, cars can go directly to Songjiang, and the number of passengers will increase even more. Therefore, the two motor companies are now preparing to add extra shifts. The sports field next to the new county government, the field has been paved and the football field goal and other equipment were completed yesterday. The scale has been basically completed. The County Education Bureau is planning to build application houses in the field. Preparatory work can be completed soon. In addition, the section of Shangsong Road near the corner of the Shanghai-Minhang Road above the County Government has frequent traffic, and the road surface has been widened by seven or eight feet. Yesterday, more than three-quarters of the work had been completed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyer's Association had originally scheduled its spring general membership meeting for 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month at the Lake Society, to elect all executive and supervisory committee members.

It is noted that the association has approximately 1,000 members, each paying a monthly membership fee of two yuan. According to the Lawyer's Association bylaws approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, members who are four months in arrears of their fees may be dismissed from the association. Therefore, before the meeting, the association must identify those members who are four months in arrears and issue a notice urging them to promptly pay their outstanding fees before the day of the general meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Registration of Dock Coolies Implemented <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Joint Announcement by Three Bureaus</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Public Utilities Bureau jointly issued an announcement stating: "Regarding the matter of public announcement, this city has a large number of ships, merchants gather, and travelers come and go in droves. Every time a ship arrives at the port, tens of thousands of pieces of luggage are handled. Except for small, lightweight items that travelers can carry themselves, all heavier items rely on dock coolies for transportation. However, the number of coolies is large and complex, and there are often unscrupulous elements who collude with dock riffraff to defraud travelers, leading to forced carrying of luggage and extortion of fares. This has been heard of from time to time. If we do not find a way to rectify this, it will not be enough to reassure merchants and travelers. Therefore, this Bureau, etc., has jointly formulated the 'Registration Rules for Dock Coolies Handling Passenger Luggage' to handle the registration of coolies. It has been submitted to the Municipal Government and approved with Instruction No. 4799, stating that the submission and rules should be announced and implemented. Accordingly, we are copying and attaching the registration rules for public notice, so that all dock coolies handling passenger luggage at all docks will comply without fail. This announcement is attached with the 'Registration Rules for Dock Coolies Handling Passenger Luggage in Shanghai'. Article 1: All coolies who handle passenger luggage as a business at docks in this city must apply to the Public Security Bureau for registration. Article 2: Those within the area of the Shanghai South Shipping Dock must also comply with the regulations of the Public Utilities Bureau for managing docks in addition to these rules. Coolies applying for registration should first obtain five copies of the registration application form from the Public Security Bureau (one copy for the Social Affairs Bureau, two copies for the Public Security Bureau, and two copies for the Public Utilities Bureau), and submit them to the Public Utilities Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau for review. Dock coolies who handle passenger luggage who pass the review and receive an approval notice should personally bring a registration fee of one silver dollar and a stamp duty of one dime to the Public Security Bureau within seven days to obtain a registration certificate and uniform style. Article 4: Coolies should wear a uniform and carry a registration certificate when operating, so that they can be inspected by officials and police officers from the Public Security Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau at any time. They should also show the registration certificate to passengers before handling their luggage. Article 5: If passengers do not want to hire them, coolies must not forcibly carry their luggage or extort money by any means. Article 6: The rates for coolies handling passenger luggage are as follows, all calculated in silver dollars: small items 5 cents, medium items 10 cents, large items 15 cents. Article 7: Coolies must submit their registration certificate to the Public Security Bureau for cancellation when they cease operations, otherwise the guarantor will be held responsible for recovering it. Article 8: If a coolie loses their registration certificate, they must report it to the Public Security Bureau for reissuance and publish a statement in the newspaper declaring it invalid. Article 9: Registration certificates must not be lent or substituted. Violators will have their registration certificates revoked and be fined up to ten yuan. Article 10: Coolies' registration certificates should be submitted to the Public Security Bureau for renewal every July. Article 11: Violators of Articles , 5, and above will be sentenced to up to 15 days of detention or a fine of up to 15 yuan. In more serious cases, their registration certificates will be revoked. Article 12: Matters not covered in these rules may be submitted for amendment at any time. Article 13: These rules shall be implemented from the date of approval by the Municipal Government, March of the 22nd year of the Republic of China."</p>

<p>Wen Hong'en, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently noted that the number of officers and police officers under his command exceeds 5,000. Through diligent training, they have been able to fulfill their duties conscientiously. Over the years, many officers and police officers have been injured or killed by thieves, and during the January 28th Incident last year, those who died in battle alongside the military were particularly brave and sacrificed their lives. At a time of national crisis, they should be commended and recognized to serve as an example for future generations. Moreover, the remains of officers and police officers who have died from overwork and illness have lingered without being properly buried. He proposes to build a memorial monument to list the names of all officers and police officers who have died in the line of duty to honor their loyalty. At the same time, he also proposes to build a public cemetery to provide burial for officers and police officers who die in service and whose families cannot afford burial expenses, so as to console their souls. This will inspire those in service and provide peace to the deceased. Wen has submitted a report to Mayor Wu, explaining the reasons for building a memorial monument for officers and police officers who died in the line of duty and a police cemetery. He proposes to build the memorial monument in Longhua and the police cemetery in Pudong, requesting the Municipal Government to instruct the Land Bureau to allocate appropriate public land in the above two districts and to allocate construction funds of 100,000 yuan for construction.</p>

<p>The Chicago Exposition Product Association's product exhibition held at the China National Products Company in the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road in this city was in its fourth day yesterday. Because it was a weekend, people from all walks of life rushed to see the rare and unusual domestic products. Among them, there was a miniature house, a wooden hall, and all kinds of furnishings. It was the result of several years of hard work by Mr. Zhou Shaofu of Suzhou. The porcelain statue of Sun Yat-sen, produced by Mr. Tong of Jiangxi Province, was eleven feet tall. The inlaid stone screen produced by Mr. Wu Guangzhi of Yangzhou was written by Qian Meixi in the early years of Daoguang and carved by Wu Boyuan. It is truly a rare treasure.

<h3 id="e171">Hui Chong Company Letter to the Support Association <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Public Screening of Film to Donate to Volunteer Army</p>
<p>The Hui Chong Film Company sent a letter to the Support Association yesterday, offering to donate the total revenue from the first day of nationwide screenings of the film taken from the Northeast to the volunteer army. The original letter stated: "The country is in great difficulty, and all people should do their best to serve the country. Hui Chong deeply knows that film has the ability to promote propaganda. The facts of the enemy being killed in front are also what the people in the rear should know in detail. Therefore, last year, it came to Shanghai from Guan, uniting with Mr. Ren Xifan and Ren Jinpin to form a frontline photography team. Going north out of Guan to take pictures on the spot, the volunteer army that has been automatically dispersed by the bitter battle in front, makes them meet with our people in the rear on the screen, or even further make people in countries other than the enemy see the truth of the front line, fully showing the spirit of self-determination of our nation, and the evil propaganda that is now falsely accused of being bandits becomes a worthless rumor. There are even those who say that now is the struggle between countries, and the national soldiers and civilians must unite and fight together to resist the enemy. Then the enemy country with 70 million people will be restrained by the Korean revolutionary patriots, and under the efforts of the 477 million people in the whole country, the last collapse will be reaped. Hui Chong has traveled all over the front line, and feels that the volunteer army he has seen are all daredevils, and the bold words of Lao Beifeng and Zhang Haitian that there are no enemy soldiers in their eyes are especially inspiring. General Sun Dianying met Hui Chong in Chengde, which has now been lost, when Hui Chong had finished filming the volunteer armies of Feng Zhanhai, Tang Juwu, and Wang Huayi and returned. His determination to resist the enemy to the death can be seen in the spirit of his troops enduring hardship. The Sun army's clothes are all thin, and the daily food is only worth a few cents, but because they are eager to save the country, they all do not think it is bitter, and each encourages the other to kill an enemy if they die, and capture an enemy if they live. On the way of the Sun army to Chifeng Weichang, General Sun smiled and told Hui Chong, 'In the near future, please take pictures of me capturing a thousand prisoners from the enemy.' And in the Battle of Chifeng on March 1, he personally witnessed the enthusiasm of his troops in battle and their bravery in killing the enemy. No one who sees it will not respectfully cry and admire it. Now, our team is planning to go out of Guan for the second time. Before going out of Guan, we will first screen the films we have taken to promote propaganda, and we are willing to donate all the income from the first day of screenings in all theaters across the country to your association and the Northeast Hardship Relief Association. The donated funds will be used to purchase necessary items, with one-half to assist General Sun and one-half to assist the volunteer armies of various departments. Please assign personnel from your association to discuss the method of collecting the funds. Colleagues share the people's concerns. This is to strive to promote propaganda work and to make a sign of assistance to the frontline soldiers, and we hope that all sectors of the country will unite to assist the volunteer army and the frontline soldiers who are fighting hard, and with the spirit of military-civilian cooperation, assist the government to resist foreign enemies, so that the enemy's military power will be reduced day by day, and the lost land of our country will be returned in time. The letter does not convey all the meaning. It is heard that the Support Association has appointed Chen Yafu to be responsible for the handling."</p>

<p>The Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 on Tangshan Road in this city, unfortunately, suffered a fire due to an electrical fault last month. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the factory has provided generous compensation to the families of the deceased and the injured workers. Because the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau needed to know the details of the aftermath, it ordered the factory to continue to report. The factory has now submitted a written report on the aftermath yesterday. The original text is as follows: "Submitting a report on the handling of the aftermath of the disaster at our factory, requesting your approval for record-keeping. Previously, our factory suffered a tragedy in which an electrical short circuit caused a steam boiler to explode, killing 82 male and female workers. In the aftermath of the disaster, our factory worked hard to handle the funeral arrangements and compensation for the families of the deceased, etc. The details have been reported to your office for review and approval. This sudden disaster was an act of God, and human power could not have prevented it. Our factory suffered huge losses and was almost on the verge of collapse. However, considering that the workers died in the line of duty, it is pitiful. In addition to giving each family a compensation fee of 300 yuan, we have now tried our best to raise funds to give each family an additional 50 yuan, in the hope of comforting the spirits, and the families of the deceased can also understand the difficult situation of our factory. There are no objections, and all have signed and received the full amount. It is reasonable to submit a supplementary report, requesting your review and approval for record-keeping. This would be a great kindness. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau."</p>

<p>Jiang Desheng, a local resident who lives at No. 45 Jianye Li, Fulvli Road, in the French Concession and works at the Western District Office of the Shanghai Telephone Company on Bixun Road, had his six-year-old son, Jiang Atang, kidnapped while playing in the alley on February 13th at 3:00 PM. The kidnappers sent a letter to the victim, demanding a ransom of 15,000 yuan for his release. The victim sent his neighbor, Chen Abing, to negotiate with the kidnappers. Because the kidnappers demanded an exorbitant amount, the matter was not resolved. It was not until the evening of the 16th of this month that Jin Jiulin, a special detective of the French Concession Police, learned that the two parties were negotiating in Room 22 of the Huayang Hotel on Guangxi Road. He immediately led detectives to arrest the kidnappers, Zhou Liansheng and Zhang Hualang. Later, they successively arrested accomplices Fei Zhaoshi and Wang De and searched a pavilion room at No. 30 Wulili on Tokyo Road, finding the female bandit, Shouzhen, and Zhang Jiangxiang, bringing the total number of arrested male and female bandits to six, and taking them to the police station for questioning. The police transferred the criminals to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District yesterday, where Judge Li Changnian conducted the trial. The police lawyer, Yao Zhaodi, stated that the defendants were arrested for kidnapping and extortion, but the main criminal was still at large and the case was complex, so the police had not yet completed a detailed investigation. He requested a postponement of three weeks to allow for a thorough investigation before filing the prosecution. After the court briefly questioned the defendants, it approved the postponement until the next trial on April 7th. The defendants were remanded to custody.</p>

<p>Plan to Expand Review</p>
<p>Founding a Japanese Language Crash Course School</p>
<p>The Japanese Review Association in this city has always been dedicated to reviewing Japan, with the main purpose of exposing Japan's plans to invade China and exclude foreigners, as well as its domestic and foreign situation, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside and precarious. It has already translated and printed many books of this kind. Recently, in order to expand the scope of review, it has established a Japanese language crash course school, led by the main leader of the association, Chuan Yuan Tuiqun, who is responsible for guidance. Using free time, the school adopts the newest and most effective teaching methods, and within six months, it can train people to be able to read Japanese fluently, thereby achieving the effect of knowing oneself and one's enemy. This is a fundamental way to resist Japan. Among the Japanese language cram schools in this city, it can be said to be a unique approach that is beneficial to anti-Japanese work, and is not superficial. Those who are interested in anti-Japanese and national salvation work and increasing their own knowledge can go directly to No. 13, Lianzhuli, Aiwenyi Road to register. The tuition fee is 25 yuan.</p>

<p>Life of Thrift Leads to Suicide</p>
<p>Leaves Ten Letters Entrusting Wife to Friends and Relatives</p>
<p>Wang Jiliang, a Shanghai native, was 34 years old. His wife, Zhang, was 29 years old and from Ningbo. They had two sons and one daughter: the eldest son, Benquan, was 7 years old, the second daughter, Meimei, was 5 years old, and the youngest son, Benin, was just 1 year old. The family lived together at No. 7, Liujialong, Sanpailou, in the city. Wang used to work as a clerk in the British-owned Gongyu Fire Insurance Company but was later dismissed due to some incident. Although he tried to find a job through referrals, he was unsuccessful, and he has been unemployed at home for many years. Usually, there was no income, and the family was large, with huge monthly expenses, so life became increasingly poor. Overwhelmed by depression, he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. Yesterday morning at around 5:00 AM, Wang got up. Zhang knew that Wang was usually very thrifty at home, and he would get up every day at dawn to wipe the windows and sweep the floor, so she did not suspect him even though he got up a little early yesterday morning, and she remained in bed. At around 8:00 AM, she suddenly heard a loud knocking on the door. She was startled and called Wang to go and open the door. However, she called him repeatedly but received no response. She quickly got out of bed to investigate, but she saw that Wang had hanged himself on the beam and had been dead for a long time. There was no way to bring him back to life. She was greatly shocked and ran out immediately to open the door, where she saw that the visitor was a relative from the countryside. She invited the relative inside, but the relative was also stunned upon seeing the situation. Zhang cried loudly over the body. The incident was then reported to the Second Office of the First District, and Director Liu dispatched Police Chief Li Fuyi to investigate. Because it involved a death, he ordered the local head to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. It is said that Wang wrote ten letters before his death, instructing his wife to distribute them to his relatives and friends. The main content of the letters was to entrust them to take care of his widow and young children.</p>

<p>Pitiful Demise of Fan Xingyou</p>
<p>Fan Xingyou, a Ningbo native and owner of a tobacco and paper shop named "Tong Kang," located at the Jian De Li intersection on Ou Jia Road in Hongkou, was fifty years old. Yesterday, around 12 PM, he went to the second floor of his shop to hold a child. His wife, forgetting he was upstairs, moved the small, portable ladder. Shortly after, Fan casually walked downstairs, lost his footing, and fell, severely injuring his head. He lost consciousness. His family rushed him to Tongren Hospital, but attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and he died around 3 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Reader's Advisor <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>On the Question of "What is China's Illness?"</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Pu Bingjun of Jiangyin and Mr. Bo Chaoyu of Nanjing: We have received letters from Mr. Pu Bingjun of Jiangyin and Mr. Bo Chaoyu of Nanjing in response to our discussion of the question "What is China's illness?" sparked by Mr. Shen Zuguang's letter. The two gentlemen criticized us for only pointing out the inaccuracies in Mr. Shen's words and not providing him with a sincere answer "from the advisor's standpoint." Mr. Bo even more vehemently described our debate as "irrelevant, pointless, and completely unrelated to the topic, a truly laughable and alarming argument." While we do not blame Mr. Bo for his vehement and even slightly fearful tone, we believe that if there were more readers like Mr. Bo, our reader's advisor would have already had a significant impact on the public and garnered widespread attention. Even if this reporter were truly "alarming," he would die content in his grave. However, no matter how loudly Mr. Bo shouts "alarming" and "laughable," we must still fulfill our advisor's duty. As the saying goes, "While there is still breath, this ambition must not be slackened." Although our attitude in replying to Mr. Shen was sometimes too severe, it cannot be said to be insincere. On the contrary, it was precisely because we were so sincere that we unknowingly expressed a strict attitude. The question "What is China's illness?" was the title given by the editor of this column in response to Mr. Shen's letter and our reply. In fact, this title is the fundamental question discussed in Mr. Shen's letter and is not, as Mr. Bo claims, "completely unrelated to the topic." This is point one. Our reply to Mr. Shen's letter focuses solely on pointing out his errors, not because we are inherently "argumentative" or "fond of literary flourishes," but because it is our style as a reader's advisor to answer questions in a way that is engaging, enlightening, and educational. I recall a famous European philosopher, a relatively young university professor (which is almost an exception in Europe). Although he was a scholar of Neo-Kantian idealism and a reformist, he had fiercely opposed war in Europe. He had many followers and a kind of organization. Once, at their annual meeting, after the university professor gave a report, he asked each member present to raise questions. He would never answer the questions immediately but would instead relentlessly and mercilessly pursue the questioner's own opinions on the question they had raised. Only when the questioner's opinions on the issue had been "exhausted" and there was no room for evasion would he then slowly express his own opinion, leaving the audience enlightened, as if they had drunk sweet nectar. Sometimes, members were pursued to the point of being speechless and even crying, but he would never stop questioning or change his relentless attitude because of these situations. This is similar to studying mathematics. If a difficult math problem arises and one immediately asks the teacher, who immediately tells him the method of calculation, then he will not deeply understand the explanation of the formula for this difficulty. Only after he has put in some thought, tried various methods, and found them all to be "dead ends" will he then gain a thorough understanding after the teacher points out the solution. Moreover, his previous hard work is a necessary process for his current thorough understanding; without the previous hard work, there will be no subsequent thorough understanding. This reporter is not talented, but I have secretly adopted this approach in dealing with readers ("Am I fond of arguing? I have no choice.") This is point two. Mr. Shen's views on national politics in his letter are completely influenced by the prevailing corrupt theories and are deeply prejudiced. That is to say, unless he is relentlessly pursued to the point of "having nowhere to hide" and "having nothing to say" and admits his own mistakes, he will not understand or accept our positive explanation of the problem. This is point three. Moreover, in the process of debate, we can see each other's fundamental views on this issue without waiting for the respondent to formally reply. Having said this, we still need to discuss the opinions of the readers before publishing our own opinions. Perhaps at that time, we only need to make a conclusion to what we have debated. Now, let us first study Mr. Bo's diagnosis of "What is China's illness?" Mr. Bo said, "As for what China's illness is, I can give a simplest and most clear answer, which is in a single thought of the four hundred million people." This is to say that China's illness lies in the fact that the four hundred million people do not have a single thought. Then, we must ask Mr. Bo: Why do the four hundred million people of China not have this "single thought?" Who is preventing them from having this single thought? Is it God? Then we should advise the public to go to church to pray. This cannot solve the problem. They are all doing somersaults in the clouds of idealism and are indeed the same. How can China be saved without changing their minds? Why can't the four hundred million people all work together to "have a single thought?" Is there any "calling the wind and summoning the rain" or "scattering beans to form soldiers" kind of mystery here? If not, please tell us where it is. If not, then we still need to pursue the "social causes" and its material causes, namely the economic causes, that prevent our four hundred million people from being able to "change their minds." If this kind of fantasy that goes up to the heavens and down to earth - the idea of "a single thought" - is not fundamentally eliminated, we will tell you that you will not believe where China's illness lies. Even if we take a step back and admit that there is some reason in what you say, it only speaks of China's symptoms but does not see the root of China's illness. This is point four. In fact, Mr. Bo has unconsciously stated the root of China's illness. Didn't Mr. Bo say: "What stage has China reached now? Foreign aggression is becoming more urgent, internal affairs are not being improved. Although the political authorities' opinions are temporarily cooperating because of the national crisis, can they ultimately cooperate until the end? In addition, natural disasters, man-made disasters, the penetration of imperialism, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, education, politics, especially finance, are full of holes!"? Aren't these "illnesses?" Can anyone deny that these are not China's illnesses? But since we want to cure the illness, we cannot treat the head when it hurts or the foot when it hurts. We must pursue where the root of the illness lies and then use the method of "hitting the snake at its seven inches" to make a fundamental attempt at treatment in order to be effective. Mr. Bo mentioned these symptoms, but who is the main illness, who is the secondary illness, who is the illness of the heart and abdomen, and who is the disease of the skin? Naturally, Mr. Bo did not have time to think deeply. However, from Mr. Bo's diagnosis of China's illnesses, we have already found a half-close diagnosis of the source of the illness, which is "the penetration of imperialism and the bankruptcy of the rural economy." The so-called imperialism is the political form of the final stage of the financial capital force of international capitalism. The bankruptcy of China's rural areas is the result of the intrusion of this imperialist force. If we want to understand the location of this root of the disease, we must: (1) study the relationship between international economic politics and China's economic politics; (2) study the historical achievements of the rulers of advanced capitalist countries and the modern fate and material causes of the actions of the rulers of colonies; (3) the history and prospects of the struggles of the international commoners or the poor masses. If everyone can patiently study these three things sufficiently, then their observation of China's problems and international problems will certainly be different from the current concept of "swallowing dates whole." At that time, when you come to observe China's phenomena, you will find that many things that you previously thought were strange are now a historical necessity, and you will find their answers. For example, the League of Nations cannot solve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Not only can it not solve the Sino-Japanese dispute, but we have long shouted loudly, but at that time everyone turned a deaf ear. What is it like now? Aren't all of our "fortunately getting it right" verified everywhere? In fact, as long as you are willing to calmly study the three methods we pointed out earlier, you will definitely come to this conclusion. This is point five. Mr. Bo's views are really too unclear, and there are many places to discuss. However, just from this, it has already become a long article, so we will stop here and talk about it later.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Jinan and French Business P] Jinan won 4-2 Outcome: 4-4 Draw Jinan's Outstanding Performance is a Pity <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the West League football match between Jinan and French Business at Yiyuan, Jinan won enthusiastic applause from the audience with its clear and wonderful performance. Although there were only a little over a thousand spectators, each and every one was very satisfied and triumphant, resulting in a 4-4 draw. However, Jinan's ball control always held the upper hand, and they once led 4-2. Because they conceded two penalty kicks in a row, the game ended in a draw. A pity for Jinan!</p>
<p>The game started with both sides exchanging attacks, each creating dangerous moments, but neither side managed to score. After about twenty minutes of play, Pan Haiguang received the ball seventeen or eighteen yards from the opponent's goal, raised his foot and swept a shot. The ball was sharp and fast, rolled along the ground, and penetrated the corner of the net. It was a beautiful sight. The goalkeeper dived to save it but failed. Jinan thus opened the scoring first. French Business</p>
<p>French Business's football skills are not to be trifled with. They once drew 4-4 with Agal. Although Jinan scored a goal, it did not dampen their spirit. The French player Fa Fanque broke through on the flank and passed the ball in front of the goal. In the ensuing melee, Jinan's Lai Zuorong was penalized for a handball, and French Business's center-back Remy Dy converted the penalty, making it 1-1. Jinan Two</p>
<p>After the tie, the center kick was taken again, and Jinan launched a vigorous attack, directly threatening the goal. They were as fierce as dragons and tigers, full of vigor. Luo Haiguang shot a high ball, which the goalkeeper Fu Lushu caught. Zhang Hongzao quickly followed up, and the goalkeeper, in a moment of carelessness, let the ball slip from his grasp and roll into the net. Jinan thus took the lead again, 2-1. French Business Two</p>
<p>Thereupon, Jinan's momentum grew stronger, and the forwards were extremely active. The situation in front of the French Business goal changed rapidly, and the atmosphere was tense. Once, Jinan's Jin Yongsen shot very quickly, but unfortunately, it went wide. French Business turned bad luck into good, launched a counter-attack, and their left inside forward, Walter, shot from a distance towards the goal. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Xu Heng failed to save it, resulting in a 2-2 tie, ending the first half. Jinan Three</p>
<p>As the second half began, Jinan attacked from the right flank. Zhong Yongsen, like a four-horse chariot, dribbled the ball deep, reaching the edge of the goal before passing it in front. The left winger Wang Nanzhen rushed up quickly and shot fiercely at the goal, but was unfortunately blocked by the goalkeeper. As one wave subsided, another rose again. Zhong Yongsen delivered a wonderful corner kick, and Liang Shutang headed it towards the goal. The goalkeeper caught the ball, but Fu Hexuan saw an opportunity and rushed up. The goalkeeper couldn't dodge in time, and the ball slipped into the net again. Jinan Four</p>
<p>Not long after the match resumed, Jinan's Yun Fengyun was kicked in the temple by Ke Laituo and left the field to apply medicine. Jinan continued to work hard. Luo Hai was magnificent and unstoppable, launching a series of attacks and achieving another great feat. Jinan then led 4-2, thinking they could secure the victory. However, fortunes change unpredictably. From then on, Jinan was at a disadvantage everywhere, and bad luck struck. The situation changed completely. French Business Three</p>
<p>Despite this setback, French Business's morale did not wane. Instead, they showed more energy and greater vigor. Fa Fanque forced a corner kick, which was well delivered. In the ensuing melee in front of the goal, the situation was chaotic, and the ball somehow sneaked into the net amidst the crowd. The Jinan players looked at each other in silence, not knowing what had happened. As a result, French Business's momentum grew stronger, and they pressed hard. Xu Heng walked over the ball, and Jinan conceded another free kick, not far from the goal. Fortunately, it didn't go in. French Business Four</p>
<p>French Business continued to press, coming on strong. Jinan's formation suddenly looked flustered. Unfortunately, they conceded another penalty kick, which Remy Dy converted again, making it a 4-4 draw. Afterwards, Jinan launched another attack, and Zhang Hongzao was the first to arrive, shooting at the empty goal, thinking that the opponent's goal would fall in an instant. However, the ball rolled out of the goal. The audience was very disappointed. The final whistle blew, and on the way home, one could still hear fans expressing their regret. The referee was Zhang Le. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan Yun Feng Wang Nanzhen Gu Shangxiang Fu Hexuan Xu Heng Liang Shutang Luo Haiguang Lai Zuorong Zhang Hongzao Chen Zhenxiang Zhong Yongsen French Business Qia Naya Fa Ge Tuo Bo Qi Si Hua Te Fu Lushu Remy Dy Lang Qi Er Tuo Lei Bao Sha Tuo Ke Laituo Chinese Football Club Yuyou and Qinghua Result: 1-1, Middle School Group Tied for Third Place Gaoqiao Defeats Qunyi to Win the "Club" Group Championship Yesterday, the Chinese Football Club held two final matches. One was between Gaoqiao and Qunyi in the "Club" group, which Gaoqiao won 3-1 to win the championship. The other was the final between Nanjing and Lingnan in the "Ball" group, which resulted in a 3-3 draw. The winner of the championship will be decided in a subsequent final match. Qinghua Defeats Jinde 2-0. Yuyou vs. Qinghua. Yesterday, Yuyou and Qinghua in the Middle School Group competed at the baseball field. Both teams were full of talent and evenly matched. In the first half, Qinghua's Chen Yong scored a goal against Yuyou. In the afternoon half, Yuyou's Dong Xiaopei kicked a goal against Qinghua. The result was a 1-1 draw. Currently, in the Middle School Group, Yuyou, Qinghua, and Fudan are evenly matched and each has a chance to win the championship. Therefore, the competition in the future will be even more intense. The lineups for Yuyou and Qinghua are as follows:</p>
<p>Yuyou Wang Zhangbao Sun Huipei Zhu Xi Qiao Sheng Wang Caigao Lu Shangfang Hu Youcheng Rao Huisheng Shang Mao Honggui Shang Dong Xiaopei Qian Yaobin Xia Shijin Sheng Xia Shen Baigui Qinghua Chen Xiaoping Jia Jiliang Xu Chens枢 Wang Boyong Fan Jiaju Ding Zhaocheng Zhou Guangzhong Zuo Yongyao Chen Yong Wu Xixiang Cao Qiuting Chinese and Western Masters Perform Billiards Li's Skills Amaze the Audience Gray's Art is Divine Two Names Worthy of Their Reputation</p>
<p>Last night, our country's billiards king Li Gongying and former world billiards champion George Gray gave an artistic performance at the East Billiards Room. Li's present fame can be attributed to his teacher Gray. Their skills have been passed down, and the student has now surpassed the teacher. Yesterday, Gray was originally scheduled to score 600 points, and Li 450 points. Later, because Li's performance was particularly good, it was changed to 500 points. As a result, when Li reached 500 points, Gray only had 471 points. The two played a total of 40 shots. On average, Li scored 12.5 points, and Gray scored 11.8 points. Li's highest scores were 72, 49, and 47, while Gray's were 66, 62, and 39. Li had only 8 missed shots in 40 shots, while Gray had as many as 10. In short, Li excels in steadiness, while Gray sometimes makes amazing shots. After the competition, Gray performed various artistic shots, which were exquisite and skillful, and certainly beyond the reach of ordinary people.

<p>The Bloody Account of Spring and Autumn Sun Wenlan</p>
<p>Two people had a fight in the house. Of course, there was considerable damage to both bodies and property; however, comparatively speaking, the owner always suffers! If, when the fight subsides, the outsider quietly runs away, there is nothing to be done about it. But if he turns around and demands compensation from the owner for bodily harm, that is truly the most ridiculous thing. According to Japanese news, there is now a man named Naito Juntaro in their country who has published a book entitled "Settlement of the Manchurian-Mongolian (Blood) Account." This is truly a far-fetched and absurd way to settle an old debt. Originally, the Japanese occupation of the three northeastern provinces was like a rogue entering someone's house. With the family (not resisting), he trashed the living room and claimed it as his own. However, he himself was careless and tripped over the threshold! Or he missed a step and broke his head (shedding blood). Not only does he not compensate for the losses, but he turns around and extorts money, wanting to settle this (blood) account. I think Naito Kotaro truly deserves to be a Japanese citizen; his thinking is indeed more comprehensive. That is why he has this book, "Settlement of the Manchurian-Mongolian Blood Account," to assist their government in ways they hadn't thought of. Fine! (It's good to have an account to settle), this is something that no one will lose out on. The lives and property of our northeastern people, as well as the nation's military supplies, airplanes, soldiers, etc., are all sacrificed at their hands! Since we are talking about settling accounts, even if we deduct the price we should pay him for (blood), we should still ask him to compensate us another 400 million taels of silver, and that might not be enough! Friends, remember! This immeasurable account of losses still deserves our efforts to settle with him!</p>
<p>Soccer Game Yongzi</p>
<p>Who Will Win the Championship?</p>
<p>Since the big soccer game between the German team and the Allied team from 1914 to 1918, until the first half of 1931, except for a few unremarkable friendly matches, we soccer fans who are not afraid of bloodshed have not seen a formal soccer match for a long time. How fortunate! In the second half of 1931, the Japanese team, eager to try their skills, challenged the Chinese team at the Northeastern Sports Field. Logically, this match should have been quite a spectacle, but unexpectedly, the Chinese team was truly inadequate. As soon as they took the field, they only defended and did not attack. The ball kept spinning around the Chinese team's goal, and the goalkeeper was unwilling to put in some effort. The ball repeatedly rolled into the goal through the gaps in his legs, creating a one-sided situation. Although the match has not yet finished, it seems that the Chinese team has no hope of winning the champagne. Good news has spread that the German team, which was defeated by the Allied team before, is not reconciled and has been very active these past few days. They are eager to regroup, issue a challenge to the Allied team, and have another decisive battle. Upon investigation, the German team's soccer skills were far superior to those of the Allied team in the previous match. After the kickoff, the German team had smooth sailing, with a tendency to directly attack the enemy's base. The Allied team saw that this was not the way to go, so they pulled in the American goalkeeper, and their military strength suddenly increased. They turned defense into offense and turned defeat into victory, snatching the champagne back from the German team's hands. The German team is a world-renowned soccer team, and the Allied team is the previous champion of the champagne. If these two teams intend to compete again at the European Sports Field, it goes without saying that it will be much more exciting than the match between the Japanese team and the Chinese team. Moreover, both sides have been recuperating for a long time and are bound to have a performance that is novel to an unknown degree, winning the audience's praise and causing them to be amazed. The competition at the Northeastern Sports Field has come to an end, while the one at the European Sports Field has not yet begun. Soccer fans, please be patient.</p>
<p>Shanghai City Ke Ding</p>
<p>Like a Kaleidoscope Full of Unpredictable Changes!</p>
<p>In the morning, I got out of bed at six-thirty and put on my clothes. Walking on the road, I couldn't see the bright lights and the bustling crowds of men and women from the previous night. I only saw the hazy fog in front of me and smelled the foul odor attacking me. Then there were the night soil collectors slowly pushing their carts, and the coolies dragging their carts forward. Other than that, there were only two or three police officers loitering on the street. If you haven't been to Wangping Street in the morning, then you should take a trip there. Because that place has become a unique "newspaper market" in Shanghai. From the front of the Shenbao newspaper office all the way to both ends of Wangping Street on Fourth Road, it is the world of newspaper vendors. Before six o'clock, they are all busy going to the newspaper office to get the newspapers. After they get them, some of them, probably the whole family, come out. Everyone folds the newspapers and sorts them in an orderly manner to wait for their customers. After seven o'clock, it is their busiest time for business. Some of the female owners count the copper coins and pack them up, piling them up in packages to exchange for silver dollars or banknotes. It is said that their daily profit is always above that of a middle-level employee! Friends who are inexperienced in the world, thinking of coming to Shanghai to play, or coming to Shanghai for some business, find it difficult to bring a lot of luggage. As soon as you get off the train, you feel the difficulty. The luggage has already been sent from the platform to outside the station. At this time, you really have some trouble. The shouting of hotel porters, the solicitation of rickshaw pullers, and the noise of chauffeurs and coachmen simply make your head spin. At the same time, there are some people who offer their services to carry your luggage. If you are not careful, your luggage may be pushed and squeezed by them and eventually disappear. There are also some people who see that you have a lot of luggage that you can't carry yourself, and they invite you to hire a car. You agree on the price with him, and he goes to call a rickshaw. Then he asks you for money, and also pays the rickshaw puller, but you only pay half. This is the rickshaw broker, he earns commissions. Trying to save money by buying a watch on the street from someone wearing an old military uniform is simply a big rip-off. Because, based on my experience, there is such a person on Nanjing Road who is always selling watches. However, he says: "I was injured in the military and have no other choice, so I have to sell this watch." According to insiders: (This is a scam!)</p>
<p>Saying and Doing Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>Chinese People Who Can Only Talk and Not Do</p>
<p>Yesterday, I ran to a friend's house and saw a study schedule he had made for himself, from four o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock in the afternoon. Except for school and meal times, there was hardly any time left. This kind of hardworking and persevering spirit is indeed admirable. When I asked him about it, his younger sister interjected and said: "Except for school, he has never even opened a book. Do you think his schedule is good?" He heard this, his face turned red, and he remained silent. I think, in China, whether it is a big matter or a small matter, it is viewed in this way: because talking big is the genius of the Chinese people. They say things that are earth-shattering, but do nothing. If there is no proof, please look at the facts: three people form a partnership to open a tofu shop. When they organize it, they ask an intermediary to set many conditions, everyone should work hard and jointly seek the development of the business. But, in the end, A takes the money to gamble every day, B takes the money to visit prostitutes every day, and C, seeing their actions, also learns from them. As a result, there is no business at all, the ashes on the tofu press are an inch thick, and the tofu pot is covered in rust. When the head of an organization takes the stage, he does nothing else. As soon as his luggage is laid out, the first step is to announce future plans, saying things that are ten thousand miles away from reality, but as long as it sounds good, there is no need to worry about whether it can be done, because (saying) is a duty, and (doing) is a favor. Why? The theorem is like this: (not saying and doing) is a fool, (saying and doing) is an idiot, (not saying and not doing) is waste, only (saying and not doing) is the most brilliant. Because there are too many extremely brilliant people in China, everything in China is a mess. Alas! Smart people!</p>
<p>Long Novel Four Company Commanders in Northeast China Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Humble Abode Attracts a Kind Neighbor, Secretly Admiring the Healthy Old Man; Quan Family Chooses a Good Match, Bitterly Condemning the Poor Surname</p>
<p>Guizhi was not very familiar with these arrangements, but seeing that the originally simple house was now newly decorated. In the center were two chairs and a table, with four chairs and two small tables on either side, completely like an old family's setup. On the table was a clock, two vases, and a set of tea utensils. On the walls were casually hung some knives, sticks, and the like. As soon as she and her mother entered, Zhao Weng, buttoning up the fur coat draped over him, nodded to them and said: "Please sit down. I have a pot of hot tea brewing." In the corner of the room was a small iron stove, on which was placed a white iron kettle, steaming hot, with steam puffing out of the spout. This alone indicated that the room was as warm as spring. Four pots of red plum blossoms and two pots of green wheatgrass were placed around the tea table. For those who lived in earthen pits with newspaper windows, there was a difference between heaven and earth within a single door. Jiang said with a smile: "Oh my! This house is really well-kept." Zhao Weng said with a smile: "I don't pay much attention to these things. They were all sent by my sons and brothers. Actually, when I managed accounts for people in the shop, I always slept in the accounting room. Where would I have such comfort? In this life, if one has a place to eat and a place to sleep, that's enough. I don't seek such excessive comfort. Please sit, please sit." As he spoke, he brought out a large teapot himself, grabbed some tea leaves, and poured water into it. He also grabbed two plates of melon seeds and peanuts and placed them on the table. He then cupped his hands to the two women and said: "Please help yourselves to a little. I'm just not one for formalities. You'll know what kind of person I am after we've lived together for a long time." Jiang sat down on a chair, but Guizhi, because the two were elders, did not feel comfortable sitting down at will, so she could only stand to one side, leaning her body slightly. Zhao Weng said with a smile: "Girl, sit down. Once the door is closed, we're all family. Don't stand on such ceremony." Guizhi smiled and sat down on the chair closest to the door. Zhao Weng stroked his beard, looked at her and nodded twice, then asked Jiang: "Old Madam, is your family from the Banner people?" Jiang replied that they were. (17)</p>
<p>Women's Paradise Women's Cry Hui Shu</p>
<p>I don't like to hear women say self-consoling words: "I am unlucky to be born a woman!" Women can also be independent, and can also govern their families and countries. Women are not cowardly, and women soldiers holding guns can also resist strong enemies. However, most people in society still can't shake the notion that women should be looked down upon by men! Or men think that the result of women's liberation will lead to (a path of depravity!). But I absolutely do not believe that this is true. Because women have knowledge, learning, and noble personalities. Women will never permanently submit to the power of men, women will no longer be men's concubines, and women will not admit to being men's playthings. Free women, equal human beings, men will never dare to invade (pure) women! However, for thousands of years, 200 million compatriots, sisters who are permanently trapped in deep pits and dark lives! Dependency has become a habit, and they huddle together like domestic fowl. Most of them still hold the belief (marry a man, marry a man, have clothes to wear and food to eat!) and have developed (the habits of a conquered slave!). If men say go east, you don't dare to go west; if men say look south, do you have the courage to go north? (Equality and liberation,) (Occupational independence,) when will that be universally realized!</p>
<p>Mothers Must Know Juan Yun</p>
<p>Taking care of children is the most tiresome and annoying thing. Young children are as delicate as gold watches, and must move forward in a prescribed manner. Eating is a crucial aspect for children. It should not be too active, nor should it be too lazy. There are many mothers who, because their child was sickened by oranges, will never let their child eat oranges again. This method seems too stupid. (Take care of children with three parts hunger and three parts cold.) This is an old saying, and it has a lot of truth to it. Children from wealthy families are always unwilling to be cold or hungry, and often get sick. Impoverished children who endure hunger and cold are just as lively and healthy, and have no problems at all. Children like to make noise for no reason, and naturally feel bored and lonely. Mothers should use novel and attractive methods to distract them. There are those who advocate giving them a beating, which is enough to increase the child's bad feelings and is not smart.</p>
<p>Regarding Maternity Yun</p>
<p>Giving birth to a child is a major difficulty for women, so-called (one foot in the coffin, one foot outside the coffin.) Especially for the first birth, this is what everyone thinks in their heads. During the ten months of pregnancy, different changes occur in each part, the uterus's elasticity stretches and shrinks, and the nerves suffer a lot of trauma. It seems that after a woman becomes pregnant, she should wear a tight-fitting belly band on her stomach. Wearing a belly band is not because she dislikes the big belly being inconvenient, but to help the child come down easily during future childbirth. The most taboo thing in midwifery is to allow stagnant blood to enter the uterus, causing dangerous metritis. In Western medicine, for inflammation in postpartum women, they advocate using ice packs, but the result of this experiment has already killed many poor postpartum women! Often, taking some Chinese medicine that is peaceful, although it delays the time a little, there are many who can be saved. Perhaps it is because the constitution of Chinese people is different from that of Westerners. No matter how strong the body has always been, it is absolutely not advisable to move around within two weeks after childbirth. If, three days after childbirth, the doctor proves that there is no illness, then you can slightly get up. Open the windows, take deep breaths; or lie flat on the bed, straighten your toes, and tighten your legs, raise your body once, and then slowly relax. This simple exercise helps the growth of muscle tissue and gradually restores the original state before pregnancy. In any case, postpartum women must have considerable protection and hygiene everywhere after pregnancy. Dangerous facts are mostly caused by negligence and lack of hygiene!</p>

<p>Chapter 4: The Situation of Business (Continued) Discussing the business of experts in each department, of course, surgery is the best, and internal medicine is the worst, because society still has a deeply ingrained impression that (Western medicine is good for surgery, and Chinese medicine is good for internal medicine.) Moreover, surgical operations are indeed effective and obvious. However, those who die after unsuccessful surgical operations are also very miserable. Surgeons who are not good at surgery cannot pretend to be good. Surgeons cannot perform their business without a good operating room. Before the past ten years, Chinese people often relied on foreigners for surgery. Although talents have emerged in the last ten years, the general public is still very superstitious about foreigners. Those who study surgery do not have many opportunities to practice surgery abroad, and when they arrive in China, they do not have a place to work because there are too few hospitals. Those who work in hospitals become anonymous because they do not put up signs. Therefore, it is difficult to gain fame, and most of the opportunities to practice are taken away by foreigners. So which surgeon in the city does not also treat internal diseases? As for internal medicine experts, it is very easy to pretend to be one. Even if there are real internal medicine experts who often consult with old doctors for the same disease, they cannot take credit for the effectiveness. Even when the patient is in critical condition, they only bear the responsibility of administering a cardiotonic injection. In Chinese customs, ophthalmology has always been clearly separated from other subjects, so society has a clearer understanding of ophthalmology experts. In addition, the instruments and operations are not available in old ophthalmology, so the business is very developed. Dentistry is in the same position as ophthalmology, but the business of dentists is taken away by silver dentists, so it is not as good as ophthalmology. In the past ten years, obstetrics has indeed been very developed due to the establishment of midwifery schools and the call for affordable obstetrics hospitals. Gynecology is still in a state of contention between the old and the new. Compared with old medicine, the business of new pediatric medicine is simply extremely small. Because new pediatric medicine has many aspects that must rely on nursing, and there are not enough pediatric nurses. Even if there are enough, the patient's family has to bear another burden. If you say to solve it by running a children's hospital, then children staying in hospitals is too far from our country's customs. In addition, except for a few people who have a good understanding of them, the general public does not pay much attention to dermatology, urology, and otolaryngology specialists. Therefore, their business is greatly affected. In order to remedy their business, they have no choice but to take two paths: one is to raise consultation fees and become aristocratic and royal; the other is to treat other diseases. The former is too much of an obstacle to affordable medicine and pharmacy, and the latter is to bury talents. Dermatologists originally always treated venereal diseases, but venereal diseases were divided in half by miscellaneous doctors, and half by general practitioners. By the time patients ask experts for treatment, there are few left, and the disease is too deep, which is often difficult to deal with. After all, there are fewer people in high society who have skin diseases, so raising consultation fees reduces the number of patients to a very low limit.</p>
<p>Saving the Country with Aviation and Saving the Country with Medicine (Part 1) Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, the pain of losing land and humiliating the country has continued year after year, day after day. However, the numb and insensitive government and the people who are drunk and dreaming of death still celebrate peace after the event. Even if there are three or five enlightened people who shout and cry in pain, how can they resist Xue Juzhou, who harmonizes with white snow? Unfortunately, they are also accused of being traitors and suffer misfortune. The author was born later, so he can only learn about the deeds of former people from the elders or read them in biographies. As for the truth at the time, after all, he can only use Mencius's saying that "it is better to have no books than to believe all books" to comfort himself. Speaking of aviation, it has only progressed and developed in the last thirty years. Although I am not an aviator, I have paid close attention to this field and have personally witnessed its gradual improvement and development. Especially the current enemy, Japan, who is bombing our north and south and plundering our land and people, has not been bombed by anyone. They have not launched a nationwide campaign to promote aviation to save the country. They only rely on the saying "be prepared for the worst" and work hard in secret. I admire their national affairs, family affairs, and all actions in society very much. They all have a certain procedure, what should come first, what should come later, what should be expanded, what should be promoted, what should be abolished. Moreover, there are not no backups, or a complete statistic, suddenly raising, suddenly abolishing reckless actions. Therefore, the opposition often has no way to oppose it. In the past, many people who traveled to the East came back and criticized them for being not as good as our Shanghai, not as good as our Beijing, what is not as good as our beautiful and rich; what is not as good as our prosperous and noble. This kind of superficial argument shows that our people do not have a world view and the mentality of improving the steps. Why? Because in the world, no matter which country, which place, which family, which person, has a kind of their own strengths, and also has a kind of their own weaknesses, but the understanding of strengths and weaknesses, each person's vision is different. Eating in front of a ten-foot square, with hundreds of concubines, Mencius does not consider this extravagant to be precious, simple diet, evil clothes, humble palaces, Dayu does not consider this crude to be cheap, each has his own place that he considers precious and cheap, precisely establishing himself to organize his family, and governing the country and pacifying the world, each has their own steps and points of attention. What about Japan? First, he understands himself, his position as an island nation, and he also realizes that he is in the environment of the United States, Russia, and various colonies, and he feels that he lives in the isolation of colored races on earth. So first of all, they focused on national defense for self-defense, and tried their best to expand the navy, first swallowing the islands. He was also afraid that a small island could not survive on its own economically and materially, so he wanted to attack from the weak places around it. Needless to say, China is an economic and material subsidiary outside his government, and he tried his best to focus on industry and commerce to absorb financial resources. He also felt the intense aggressiveness of the European and American countries in the environment, and that everything was isolated and weak, and the danger was extraordinary, so he tried his best to train the army, realize the continental policy, and invade China to strengthen his national power. Therefore, for sixty years, he has followed this step, and for all the domestic supplementary preparations and the development and expansion of foreign forces, he must first deliberate and consider them carefully, and then draw up a budget, and then proceed one by one, distinguishing between the priority and urgency of cutting off the long and making up for the short. Therefore, their roads before the Great Earthquake are really worlds apart from Shanghai. But their kind of bad roads can be passable everywhere in the country, and they can also see the construction of their factory houses, which are simple and rough, narrow and rotten. Compared with our factories, they are really a drop in the bucket, but they can ship goods, supply them domestically, and sell them overseas. And taking their train, the narrow and small situation, at first glance, looks like a toy. It is much better than our domestic, large single-track, magnificent, but it can pass throughout the country, the clock is not wrong, and all materials can be replenished domestically. Also, their clothes, cloth, jewelry, and the like, which one can compare with our beautiful and wealthy, but they deposit the money for this luxury in banks and post offices, or supply it to factories and for national defense, which shows that they have a whole national plan and steps for governing the country, so a small and weak island country, in a few decades, became vigorous and listed among the world's five major powers. This is the result of continuous, year-by-year struggle, the effectiveness of painstaking effort and perseverance, and it is by no means possible to achieve success with a moment of excitement and effort. Now talking about the progress of aviation, everyone already understands, but the achievements of the last twenty years are worth recording, because before, it was a trial period, not a practical time, so there are quite a few records of failures and losses. I don't have time to describe this kind of progress history, so let others say it. But I can say one thing here. Our enemy, Japan, did not invent the plane, nor can he build a plane country, but he understands the trend of the modern world very well, the necessary elements for establishing a country, and the path to follow for competition and survival, so he identified the goal, Lunya, buyya, studiya, doya, put the structure of the plane and the method of driving into it day and night without rest, and painstakingly digging. Those with aspirations among the people sacrificed many lives and money to research, which I saw with my own eyes. Because of poor driving skills or machine failures, I don’t know how many people fell to death and burned to death. Not to mention the establishment and research in the navy and army. If a driver or mechanic dies, they must hold a memorial service to collect pensions and comfort his family, teach and nurture his children, and various rewards to make the drivers have something to rely on and invigorate him. The spirit of hard work and struggle is because airplanes can be bought immediately with money, but talents cannot be bought immediately. If talent can be bought with money, and people's hearts cannot be bought with money, it still won't work, so the realization of saving the country through aviation must have the lasting spirit and patience of Goujian and Wu, in order to solve the two key points of talent cultivation and airplane repair and manufacturing, and then we can achieve the goal of saving the country!</p>
<p>Recent Trends in the Classification Method of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Liu Qijing</p>
<p>General Remarks</p>
<p>In the past, the classification of pulmonary tuberculosis only paid attention to clinical symptoms, and the disease was divided into the first, second, and third stages. Now, in addition to clinical symptoms, attention must also be paid to pathological anatomy, X-ray examination, etc., and lung diseases are divided into chronic (benign) and acute (malignant) types, so the relationship is more complicated. Now, most people still use the terms first, second, and third stages for lung diseases. I am writing this article to introduce this to readers. But before explaining this article, I will first briefly explain the following items: (1) Structure of the Lungs</p>
<p>The lungs are like a large tree. The trunk is the trachea, the large branches are the bronchial tubes, the small branches are the bronchioles, and the smallest branches are the capillaries. The leaves are the alveoli. The function of the leaves is the same as that of the alveoli, and they are the most important part of the new age. The lungs are wrapped in the pleura and are deeply penetrated in several places to separate them, so the right lung is divided into upper, middle, and lower lobes, and the left lung is divided into upper and lower lobes. The shape of the entire lung is like a cone, and the tip is called the apex of the lung. (2) Reasons Why the Apex of the Lung is Prone to Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>(1) The upper opening of the chest cavity is a horizontal plane in children. After development, due to the descent of the sternum, it is inclined forward and downward. Therefore, the</p>

<p>Extra Edition of the Shen Bao: Enemy Plans to Attack My Rear at Xifengkou; Formal Talks on Tianjin-Beiping Security; Japanese Planes Reconnoiter My Forces Ahead of Shihe</p>
<p>Beiping:  Because the enemy's attacks on Xifengkou have repeatedly failed, resulting in extremely heavy losses, they are attempting to probe towards Luandong to create a diversion, and are plotting to attack my rear at Xifengkou.  This morning, enemy planes were spotted conducting reconnaissance ahead of Shihe. My forces ahead of Shihe, up to Lengkou, are all forming extremely solid defensive lines under the command of Shang Zhen and others. If the enemy advances, they will be met with a decisive blow. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping:  The diplomatic corps is paying close attention to reports that the Japanese, frustrated by repeated setbacks at Xifengkou, are planning to probe towards Luandong to disrupt Tianjin and Beiping. This morning there was an informal meeting. If necessary, they will urge the Japanese to respect the treaty, maintain security in Tianjin and Beiping, and protect foreign nationals.

According to them, Liu Guitang accepted one million yuan, thirty cannons, and one hundred rifles from the Japanese army to betray the country. Cui Xingwu accepted three thousand rifles and seven hundred thousand rounds of ammunition from the Japanese army to betray the country. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with our troops in northern Rehe. There are more than 2,500 wounded soldiers in Tongzhou Hospital, all with minor injuries. Many of those with serious injuries have frozen to death. A certain front-line agency discovered maps among enemy prisoners that included my Chahar Province within the borders of Manchukuo. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping:  Song Zheyuan telegraphed Beiping on the 18th, expressing deep concern about the battle situation at Luowenyu, Shancha Pass, and other places. He stated that he had already sent one regiment to Shijiazhuang Town today, and the rest would follow in succession. Although our officers and soldiers have suffered many casualties, they remain extremely excited and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: The enemy at Luowenyu totals more than 9,000 men, accompanied by 50 trucks, 3 armored vehicles, 4 mountain guns, 6 flat-trajectory guns, and more than 20 machine guns. They are newly arrived reinforcements who detoured through Chaoyang and Pingquan. Since the early morning of the 16th, they have launched several fierce attacks on our Luowenyu positions. Our troops fought bravely, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The positions were gained and lost more than a dozen times. At 12:00 midnight on the 18th, our army, recognizing that the enemy in front was excessively stubborn, urgently dispatched strong forces to encircle the enemy's rear. The enemy near Shuiquan, threatened on their left flank and rear, collapsed and retreated in disarray on the morning of the 19th. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan said that two battalion commanders and one company commander under his command were killed in action recently. After receiving the order to resist the enemy this time, he will continue to work hard to kill the enemy. As long as the national spirit does not die, losing territory does not matter.

<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan's army fought extremely bravely against the Japanese outside Xifengkou and captured many spoils of war, including 11 light tanks, 6 armored vehicles, 18 artillery pieces, 6,477 rifles (mostly Han Linchun-type rifles from the Northeast Arsenal), 1,340 pistols, 36 machine guns, 4 Japanese army flags bestowed by the Japanese Emperor, and 1 airplane. There were also mountains of warhorses, grain, helmets, military knives, and canteens, the numbers of which have not yet been determined. In addition, more than 2,700 Mongolian soldiers, more than 1,800 Korean soldiers, and more than 6,420 Japanese soldiers were captured. Each soldier had a talisman hidden on his person. The Song army vowed before battle, "If we do not kill ten enemies on this trip, we will not return alive." The broadsword teams entered the enemy lines, and swords flashed everywhere, and Japanese heads rolled. The Japanese army had a superstition that they could not be reincarnated if killed by swords, so many knelt on the ground and pleaded to be spared from being killed by swords, willing to be shot instead. The spoils of war obtained by the Song army are worth more than ten million yuan. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping: Bao Wenwei came to Beiping from Baoding this morning and immediately went to Tianjin. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Han Fuju said that he came to Beiping to meet Chiang Kai-shek because Chiang was in Baoding, and to visit He to discuss important matters. He plans to return to Jinan in three or four days. Shandong Province has been extremely peaceful since Liu Guitang fled. Liu's troops have always been colluding with a certain party, so they mutinied again this time. The number of Japanese residents in Jinan has been decreasing daily since the September 18th Incident. A Japanese warship is still berthed in Qingdao. A warship was spotted firing at a deserted island north of Muping a few days ago. It is not clear which country the warship belonged to, and it fled immediately. It is rumored that the Japanese will blockade the sea ports of North China. Our army does not need sea ports for combat, which is equivalent to helping us resist foreign goods. The failure of the Rehe campaign was due to poor politics. I still uphold the eight-character slogan of "suppressing bandits internally, resisting foreign powers externally." We must truly unite and resist for a long time. Even if the Japanese occupy several provinces, they must return them sooner or later. Zheng Jicheng is still in the Jinan Higher Court because the court has not yet received the pardon order.

<p>Reuters, Rome, 19th: A communique was released today regarding the talks between British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Minister Simon, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last night and this afternoon. It stated that the British and Italian authorities, after discussing the general situation, studied a plan to seek understanding on major political issues. This plan was initiated by Mussolini and aims to achieve cooperation between the four major Western powers, Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, in order to enhance the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and establish a declaration of non-use of force, thereby seeking long-term peace in Europe and the world.</p>

<p>Rome: British and Italian officials are reluctant to comment further on the precise meaning of the aforementioned Anglo-Italian joint communique. However, it is reported that Mussolini's plan to seek an understanding among the four major powers has been submitted to the French and German ambassadors to Italy for inter-power consultations. The plan will be handled by the heads of the four powers, in the hope of resolving major issues that could trigger significant conflicts in Europe at any time. It is reported that this plan is merely a method of contact and does not contain concrete solutions to the problem. The issue of treaty revision currently occupies a large part of the discussions between British and French authorities, while the issue of arms reduction has barely been discussed. At 6:30 tonight, the British Prime Minister and Foreign Minister paid a 35-minute visit to the Pope. The British officials are scheduled to depart for London tomorrow afternoon, with a brief stopover in Paris.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 19th:</p>
<p>During the talks between the British and Italian authorities, the most important point was Mussolini's presentation of a completely unknown plan. Only the preamble to this plan has been discussed by both parties. This plan had been sent to the French government before the meeting between the two sides. What the British officials will discuss with the French authorities after arriving in Paris next Tuesday is this plan, but with British opinions attached. Mussolini's intention is to have the four major powers preside over Europe. Judging from yesterday's meeting, it can be seen that Mussolini's intention is not incompatible with the nature of the League of Nations. Therefore, the main parts of the Italian plan can be used to reform the international organization and make it more solid. This is easier to do after Japan left Geneva, because the remaining permanent members of the Executive Council are only four countries, and these four countries are the four major countries referred to in the Italian plan. As for the remaining countries, the British cabinet does not intend to exclude them from participating, but if the major countries can reach a compromise first, then the remaining countries will be more easily amenable. In addition, Britain is quite reactive to German Chancellor Hitler's violence. The Italian Prime Minister is well aware of this, so he will use a friendly attitude to advise Germany in order to reassure Britain.</p>

<p>Havas, Rome, 19th: British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon held talks with the Italian Prime Minister yesterday and today. The government has just released a communiqué stating that the Prime Minister met with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon at the Palazzo Venezia from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. yesterday. This afternoon, from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., they met again at the British Embassy. After exchanging detailed views on the overall situation, both sides studied a compromise plan on various major issues. This plan was drafted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and is intended to enable the four major Western powers to cooperate with each other in order to maintain long-term peace in Europe and the world in accordance with the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the declaration prohibiting the use of force. The British cabinet members are scheduled to depart from Rome for London tomorrow, with a slight delay in Paris in order to meet with French authorities.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 19th: French political circles are quite shocked that the Anglo-Italian Rome Conference is coming to an end. It is widely believed here that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will soon invite French Prime Minister Daladier to visit Rome, because MacDonald expressed in Rome that the current discussions should not exclude France.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 19th: It is rumored that Mussolini has invited French Prime Minister Daladier and German Chancellor Hitler to Rome to meet with the Italian Prime Minister after the Anglo-Italian authorities have met. However, as of now, the French Prime Minister has not received any invitations.</p>

<p>Havas, Paris, 19th: The Times' Rome correspondent commented on the Anglo-Italian talks, saying that Mussolini and MacDonald have agreed to move Europe in the direction of being presided over by the four major powers, and to exclude all countries that have traditionally supported French policy. There is a speculation in Rome that is becoming increasingly credible, namely that MacDonald is mediating to persuade German Chancellor Hitler to restrain himself and adopt a peaceful attitude. However, Germans in Rome fear that Mussolini is secretly beginning to approach France without informing Berlin. The rumor that German Chancellor Hitler will visit Rome at the end of this month or the beginning of next month originates from this. In addition, some people are deliberately spreading the rumor that Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya will meet with MacDonald specifically to discuss the Hungarian issue. Others say that MacDonald has suggested strengthening the Locarno Treaty in order to allow France to substantially reduce its armaments.</p>

<p>Havas, Rome, 19th: This afternoon, British Prime Minister MacDonald was received by the Pope. Compared with the meeting between the British and Italian authorities, its importance on international issues cannot be mentioned in the same breath, but it cannot be regarded as an ordinary visit. First, the issue of Malta has now been resolved, as evidenced by Britain's appointment of Sir Clive as the Holy See representative. Although this matter has been concluded, it is natural for the British Prime Minister to take the opportunity to talk with the Pope since he has come to Rome. Second, British public opinion has been greatly shaken by the arrest of British engineers in Moscow. The Pope has always paid close attention to the Russian issue, so he is also very concerned about British-Russian relations.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th: After the recent American bank holiday ended, the Parker Savings Bank failed to reopen, and the bank's manager, Mr. Sterns, committed suicide a few days ago. When he died, the manager left a letter exonerating the bank's employees. The bank's deficit amounts to US$1.5 million. The US government is currently investigating this case. According to today's news, a large part of the dispute at the Detroit Bank is expected to be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th: State banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System but have not yet opened since the bank holiday have now been approved by the Treasury Department to allow depositors to withdraw up to 5% of their deposits.</p>

<p>Reuters, Lima, 19th: Peruvian public opinion expresses indignation at the League of Nations' handling of the Colombia-Peru dispute. The general public is particularly vehement about this matter, and believes that the League of Nations' report is absurd, unfair, and incomplete, and does not understand the true nature of the South American dispute. The report was released by the League of Nations Executive Council on March 17 and includes three parts: historical facts, conclusions, and recommendations. It also requires both sides to withdraw their troops from the disputed areas immediately and begin negotiations. The facts cited in the report are extremely unfavorable to Peru.</p>

<p>Nanjing: The National Government held Memorial Week at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th. Those present included Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Daqi, Li Yuanding, Lin Xiang, Qiu _, Chen Zhuo, and more than 500 National Government staff members. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Yu Youren's report was entitled "Comforting and Encouraging the Patriotic Soldiers at the Front Lines." It stated that this report can be said to be a call to arms against foreign enemies. Before the report, there was a proposal that we should light incense and offer it to the heroic and valiant soldiers who have fought bravely since the September 18th Incident. They were so loyal to the meaning of life that they sacrificed so generously. We respectfully pay our respects and wish the glory of the country and nation to be shared with their glory forever and ever. Dear soldiers at the front lines, you are resisting foreign aggression with your flesh and blood, protecting the country and nation with your spirit, and fighting resolutely and continuously to uphold justice for the world and seek peace for mankind. We, whether at the front or in the rear, are on the same battlefield, fighting against the same enemy, demanding the debt of blood and flesh from the enemy. The victory of this war will surely belong to us. Since the September 18th Incident, the Republic of China, which had begun to move towards peace and construction, has suddenly been subjected to violent aggression. Our land, people, and sovereignty have been trampled upon. Countries around the world have expressed their indignation for us and have given us righteous assistance. For more than a year, we have reached the point where we can no longer endure and cannot retreat any further. At this time, we can only resolutely send troops to punish the rebels. Now, we can report to the front that all those in the rear are working together with one heart and one mind to resist foreign aggression, and all those who should help the front are doing their best. Under the supervision of world justice, we will never compromise with the enemy. We would rather be shattered like jade than be preserved like tile. We are determined to do so today. Recalling the continuous domestic wars of the past twenty years, they were truly boring. Now, we have encountered a real enemy. Today, in the name of the country and the nation, we send you慰勞品, wishing you to uphold this glorious and solemn慰勞品 to strive for the inevitable victory. (20th Central News Agency)</p>

He said that at this time of national crisis, the responsibility of party members and the public in North China is extremely heavy.

To understand shame, everyone must first understand their own shame, and not push away responsibility, or not shoulder the responsibility of saving the country from disaster. Only by understanding one's own shame can one save the country from humiliation, and then train one's own fighting spirit to take responsibility and correct it. He used the story of the King of Wu seeking revenge and the Old Man of Yugong moving mountains as an analogy, and the meeting adjourned at noon. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: For the transport of Guangdong salt to Hunan, hundreds of thousands of small merchants and porters have traditionally relied on carrying the salt into the province for a living. However, the Taili Heji Company signed a contract with the Hunan and Guangdong authorities to monopolize the transport and sale of salt, and the salt commissioners of the two provinces also approved a trial implementation of the scheme, resulting in the loss of jobs for a large number of people. Representatives were sent to Nanjing to petition and appeal to various parties before the year, but with no results. Members of the Central Committee from Hunan, Tang Shengzhi, Tang Youqian, He Yaozu, Wang Qi, Guo Chuntao, Deng Feihuang, etc., recently sent a joint letter to Finance Minister Song, stating that the Guangdong salt monopoly case has been pending for half a year and has not been resolved. The Hunan Provincial Government has not implemented it due to strong public opposition. The Taili Company even lobbied the Guangdong salt commissioners to allow them to start operations in Guangdong Province first. Recently, disputes have arisen in the border counties of Hunan Province, such as the severance of salt distribution and the economic alienation of the people in the two provinces, resulting in a serious situation. At this time of national crisis, with the flames of war burning fiercely, failure to quickly provide relief may trigger a disturbance. This case concerns the livelihoods of millions of people and the safety of thousands of miles of territory. They requested that the trial implementation order be swiftly revoked in order to maintain the people's livelihood and quell the source of the unrest, etc. (Morning of 20th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Tianjin: Beiyang Hospital covers an estimated 39 mu of land and was founded by Li Hongzhang 52 years ago. It is well-equipped. It used to be under the jurisdiction of the Navy Department, but in the last five or six years, the Navy Department stopped providing funding, and the hospital's operations fell into difficulty. The hospital's doctors and staff, totaling more than 30 people, rely solely on registration fees to purchase medicines and food, and there is no salary. Last year, more than 50,000 poor people were treated. Foreign doctors resigned and went elsewhere due to the lack of salary. 14 years ago, a Frenchman named Kou was a doctor at the hospital. Kou had a small steamship that was being repaired at the Dagu Shipyard and was unfortunately destroyed. Kou returned to his country the year before last and independently priced the ship at 140,000 yuan and filed it with the French Consulate. Last winter, a certain authority sold the hospital to the French Municipal Council, and the contract was established on January 15. The Chinese signatory was so-and-so, and the French signatory was Consul General Nabos. The price per mu was 20,000 taels, totaling 780,000 taels. There are two buildings next to the hospital, which were early foreign doctors' dormitories. This time, the French Municipal Council depreciated them for 140,000 yuan to compensate for Kou's ship losses. The French Municipal Council took over the two buildings on the 18th. Hospital Director Zhang Zixiang was ordered by the Navy Department not to hand over the keys. The Municipal Council immediately sent personnel to break open the doors and forcibly take over. The Municipal Council has scheduled to take over the entire hospital property on the 25th and has issued a notice to vacate. If they do not vacate by the deadline, they will forcibly take over. Director Zhang, who is empty-handed, is afraid that he will not be able to resist. It is reported that the hospital owes foreign medical expenses of no more than 200,000 yuan. During the time of Chu Yupu, there was an attempt to sell it, but the sale was stopped due to opposition from the citizens. Now it has become a reality. Alas, the die is cast, and opposition is ineffective. What a pity! (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek went north, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan also came north from Nanjing. He met Chiang Kai-shek in Shijiazhuang to discuss diplomatic policy towards Japan. After completing his official duties, he went to Beiping to meet with envoys from various countries, declaring China's future diplomatic policy towards Japan. He stated that if Japanese troops disturb Tianjin and Beiping, harming the rights of third countries, China will not be responsible. He also strongly refuted rumors of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations in order to avoid confusing the international community. In addition, after returning to China, Ambassador to Japan Chiang Zuobin also went to Baoding a few days ago to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the recent situation in Japan. He then went to Beiping to meet with Luo. Because Luo had completed his work and there were many accumulated events in the ministry awaiting handling, he took the No. 202 express train back to Nanjing with Chiang Zuobin last night. This morning (the 17th) at 9:00 a.m., the train passed through Jinan. Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Industry Director Wang Fangting, Provincial Committee Member Zhang Weicun, Provincial Secretary General Zhang Shaotang, and Higher Court President Wu Zhenzan all went to the station to welcome them. Luo and Chiang did not get off the train and met with Han and others on the train, and also met with various reporters, talking for a long time. At 9:30 a.m., Luo and Chiang's special train went south. Luo and Chiang's statements are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>#### Luo Wengan's Statement</p>
<p>The reporter first interviewed Luo and made the following statement:</p>
<p>(Question) How did the Minister meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the general direction of diplomatic policy towards Japan?</p>
<p>(Answer) I have made many statements in Beiping and Tianjin, and most of them have been disclosed in various newspapers. There is no other news to tell you.</p>
<p>(Question) What new avenues are there for Sino-Japanese diplomacy?</p>
<p>(Answer) Last month, the League of Nations passed a report and organized an advisory committee, inviting the United States and Russia to join in discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute. The United States has sent a representative to participate. Although Russia has not joined, it has expressed considerable sympathy for us. The advisory committee held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the Sino-Japanese incident, and there will be new developments in the future.</p>
<p>(Question) After the Minister returns to Nanjing this time, will he come north again soon?</p>
<p>(Answer) I am returning to Nanjing to deal with the backlog of events in the ministry, so I probably won't be able to come north recently.</p>
<p>(Question) After the Minister arrives in Nanjing, will he go to Shanghai to meet President Wang?</p>
<p>(Answer) President Wang is arriving in Nanjing from Shanghai, and I won't have time when I arrive in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the recent battle situation at the front?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our army, Song Zheyuan's troops, have annihilated many enemies at Xifengkou, and the battle situation at Lengkou is also very good.</p>
<p>(Question) Is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returning south soon?</p>
<p>(Answer) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek may not return south recently.</p>
<p>Then Luo had a cordial conversation with the various dignitaries who welcomed him, and said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek insisted on resisting to the end, and that external reports that he would negotiate directly were absolutely untrue. Direct negotiations are what the enemy hopes for, using heavy troops to pressure us on the one hand, and spreading rumors on the other, to entice us with sweet words, with the intention of promoting direct negotiations. Little do they know that even if our country resists and is defeated, we will never surrender. Although the League of Nations is helping our country, we cannot rely on it, but we must never privately compromise with Japan. This principle is very clear and does not need to be argued. I once declared to the Japanese that even if China is defeated and retreats south of the Yellow River because of resistance, it will still resist to the end.</p>
<p>#### Chiang Zuobin's Statement</p>
<p>After the reporter talked with Luo, he interviewed Chiang Zuobin. They talked to each other as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Ambassador's opinion on the current Sino-Japanese diplomacy?</p>
<p>(Answer) Minister Luo has already talked about this to you just now. Because of my position, I am sorry that I cannot express my opinion.</p>
<p>(Question) Will the Ambassador return to Japan soon?</p>
<p>(Answer) Under these current circumstances, of course I cannot return to Japan.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the general situation in Japan?</p>
<p>(Answer) The situation in Japan is quite complicated. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into two factions: one is the radical faction, consisting of ambitious young people and young soldiers, who advocate invading China and expanding territory. Since occupying our Northeast, their arrogance has become more and more rampant, and they will not hesitate to start a world war. The second is the moderate faction, consisting of the Japanese people, intellectuals, capitalists, and experienced strategists. In their view, although Japan has occupied the Northeast and offended the League of Nations, it is a failure rather than a victory, a shame rather than an honor. They are worried and feel the danger of the country's fortune. However, the radical faction's aggressive proposals have now occupied four provinces and achieved great victories, and are worshiped by the majority of people, so the moderate faction is silent and dare not speak. Their finances are extremely chaotic and fearful, but because the country's organization is strict, they are currently trying to maintain it, but I am afraid that there will be a day when it cannot be sustained.

<p>Regulations for Primary and Secondary Schools, Normal Schools, and Vocational Schools (I)</p>
<p>Based on the Law on Primary and Secondary Schools, Normal Schools, and Vocational Schools passed by the Legislative Yuan, and in order to provide a basis for those running schools, the Ministry of Education, through its Department of General Education and the Counselor's Office, has compiled four types of regulations for primary schools, secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. This took two months, with more than ten ministry meetings and dozens of group meetings held successively. After repeated revisions and reviews, and to expedite the promulgation, the organizers worked day and night. Finally, on the 18th, the review of the four types of regulations was completed and officially promulgated on the same day. However, sending them to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities will take some time after they have been typeset and printed. The four types of regulations are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e257">(I) Primary School Regulations <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 1 General Principles</p>
<p>Article 1 These regulations are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Primary School Law.</p>
<p>Article 2 Primary schools are places for the implementation of national compulsory education. According to the provisions of Article 1 of the Primary School Law, the following training shall be implemented: (1) Cultivating children's healthy physique, (2) Tempering children's good character, (3) Developing children's aesthetic interests, (4) Enhancing children's life skills, (5) Training children's labor habits, (6) Enlightening children's scientific thinking, (7) Cultivating children's spirit of mutual assistance and unity, (8) Developing children's concept of patriotism and love for the community.</p>
<p>Article 3 Primary schools accept school-age children for a period of six years. Before education is universal, a period of four years will be considered the end of compulsory education.</p>
<p>Article 4 Primary schools are divided into two levels. The first four years are the junior primary school, which may be established independently. The last two years are the senior primary school, which must be established in conjunction with the junior primary school.</p>
<p>Article 5 In order to promote compulsory education, in addition to the above-mentioned primary schools, simple primary schools and short-term primary schools may be established in various localities. Simple primary schools enroll school-age children who cannot enter junior primary schools, and their study period is calculated by converting teaching time to 6,2800 hours. Short-term primary schools enroll older out-of-school children aged 10 to 16, and their study period is one year, calculated by converting teaching time to at least 540 hours. Simple primary schools and short-term primary schools shall be operated in accordance with the Ministry of Education's Implementation Measures for the First Phase of Compulsory Education and Implementation Measures for Short-Term Compulsory Education.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Chapter 2 Establishment and Management <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Article 6 Primary schools are established in accordance with the provisions of Articles 3, 4, and 5 of the Primary School Law.</p>

<h3 id="e261">Zhejiang University President Guo's Plan <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Guo Renyuan, the new president of Zhejiang University, convened all faculty, staff, and students on the 17th for a speech, mainly covering the following points: (1) After the administrative unification of Zhejiang, further work should be done to improve the efficiency of administration. (2) In reorganizing finances, the first step should be to check whether there is any internal waste in the school. (3) The school should focus on academic affairs, with the administrative part only assisting academic affairs. (4) It is advocated to vigorously save on administrative expenses and use the funds specifically to increase library equipment for the three colleges. (5) Equal importance should be attached to the development of the three colleges, and it is advocated that the academic affairs of the three colleges should have considerable connections. (6) For each department, it is advocated to enrich the content and narrow the scope. Mr. Guo estimates that after vigorous tightening of administrative expenses, at least 40,000 yuan can be saved each year, and he is determined to keep this amount for the equipment of the three colleges, so the equipment of the three colleges should be considerable. Mr. Guo also announced yesterday that the administration will be reorganized. The original administrative organization of Zhejiang University was the Secretariat, with one Secretary-General and two secretaries, divided into six sections: document registration, administrative affairs, accounting, library, and publishing. Each section had one section chief and several section members and assistants. There were also student life instructors, a school doctor's office, a military training department, and a physical education department, all directly under the president. Now, President Guo has reorganized the Secretariat into the Secretariat and the General Affairs Office. The Secretariat has five sections: document registration, library, military training, and physical education (the original publishing section has been canceled). The General Affairs Office has two sections: administrative affairs, accounting, and medical affairs. The title of Secretary-General Jiang is canceled, and the original two secretaries are reduced to one. Also, student life instructors have been dismissed. In this way, monthly expenses can be saved. It is said that Wang Shiying has been internally appointed as the secretary, and Tong Dingzhi has been hired as the director of general affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Report on the Ministry of Education Inspector's Inspection of Education in Shanxi Province <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>(8) Existing middle schools should be reorganized or eliminated, taking into account the suitability of the region and the needs of society. More joint middle schools should be established, and efforts should be made to make them co-educational, add high schools, enrich the content, improve the treatment of teachers, and hire more full-time teachers to assist the principal in managing administrative and educational affairs.</p>
<p>(9) Existing normal schools should be greatly reformed. Male and female schools should be merged, and three to five schools should be set up in key areas. The rest can be moved to rural areas or reorganized into joint normal schools. It is also advisable to weigh the urgency and gradually increase them. The system of free subsidies for normal school students must be restored, but the subsidies can be appropriately reduced compared to the previous amount. The curriculum should focus on practice and also take into account the characteristics of rural education.</p>
<p>(10) Junior vocational schools must be carefully planned and completed within a time limit. Senior vocational schools should add various specialized schools as needed by the local area, and the internship equipment must be complete.</p>
<p>(11) Compulsory education should be promoted quickly, and short-term compulsory education is especially important. The Taiyuan City experimental zone has just been established. The results of its operation and the effect of urging various counties to comply should be strictly reviewed and reported by the department.</p>
<p>(12) Senior primary schools should be co-educational. The level should be raised uniformly to connect with junior high schools. Special attention should be paid to the授與 of production skills and the cultivation of labor habits. Efforts should be made to popularize junior primary schools. In remote areas, joint primary schools should be established by combining two or more districts, neighborhoods, townships, and towns. In single-grade or two-part schools, the grouping teaching must be匀称 and appropriate. Poor children who cannot afford to buy textbooks and educational supplies should be provided with them.</p>
<p>(13) Among schools at all levels, those with unstable school buildings that are in danger of collapsing and those with cramped classrooms that cannot accommodate students, although few, should be repaired and expanded separately. Facilities such as libraries, gyms, and bathrooms should also be emphasized. The complexity of the equipment in internship places, such as factories and farms, should depend on the nature of the school and the needs of the environment.</p>
<p>(14) Teaching equipment in schools at all levels, such as reference books, specimens, and instruments, should be added as much as possible according to the needs of the school, and the quantity should be enriched. The quality should be new, and the original equipment should also be diligently organized. Colleges and universities are large in scale and should be complete. Other things, such as extracurricular reading materials that are not closely related to coursework, can be purchased later.</p>
<p>(15) The curriculum for schools at all levels must be based on educational principles and the nature of the subjects, with the general rules of rich content, novel teaching materials, appropriate level, organized structure, and clear outline, and the curriculum should be revised. Primary and secondary schools should implement teaching in accordance with the standards set by the Ministry, and primary schools can appropriately add rural teaching materials.</p>
<p>(16) Teaching in schools at all levels must be based on the nature of the subjects and the psychology of the students, and the most economical and effective methods should be adopted separately. The method of injection, which is detrimental to the development of the spirit, should not be used unilaterally, especially in primary schools. Teachers should be responsible for guiding self-study and extracurricular reading. The graduation examinations for primary and secondary school students should be implemented quickly, and the review of the middle school entrance examination papers can continue to be carried out.</p>
<p>(17) The moral education of schools at all levels should be implemented conscientiously in accordance with the training objectives set by the Ministry. In strict training, the meaning of personality influence should be used to疏导 their thoughts, regulate their lives, patiently guide them, and be moderate in宽严, in order to achieve the practical effect of cultivating good character and整饬风纪. Teachers should be responsible for guidance, and there should not be excessive setting up of moral education personnel.</p>
<p>(18) Physical education in schools at all levels should be carried out in accordance with the Ministry's orders. Physical education committees should be established quickly, standards should be set, and progress should be strictly supervised. Those with incomplete equipment must do their best to expand it. Health should be properly guided by the school doctor, and schools without a school doctor can be responsible by the teachers.</p>
<p>(19) The implementation of various social education facilities should be筹办 in accordance with the three important facilities for promoting social education, namely, the promotion of mass schools must be督促 to realize it as scheduled, and the exhibition department of the mass education hall must be迅予改组成立. In addition, the affairs of various departments must also be completed in the shortest period of time. Libraries, newspaper offices, mobile libraries, public sports fields, recreation fields, literacy campaigns, popular lectures, remedial education, special education, social education personnel training institutes, and other undertakings should be separately整顿 and兴办 as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(20) The preservation of antiquities should be切实 responsible by the antiquities preservation committees of each county to avoid destruction. In areas where antiquities are more prevalent, such as Datong County, a larger preservation committee should be organized to manage them. If necessary, the power of the state can be used to help it proceed.</p>
