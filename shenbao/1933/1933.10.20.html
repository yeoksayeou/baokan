<h3 id="c15">通貨膨脹與軍備膨脹　實 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>當世界各國之實行金本位制也。其純金量雖各不相同。而求物價尺度之穩定。與金幣流通之普遍則一。故謂金本制帶有國際的流通性可。謂資本主義的自由主義。亦以金本位制爲基礎。亦無不可。英國爲貿易自由主義之先導。已於一九三一年秋季。放棄其金本制。事實上雖未直接採用貨幣膨脹政策。然其利用通貨對外匯兌價值低落。於國内提高物價。冀產業之繁榮。於海外則奬勵輸出。圖經濟之興復。因此乃得救濟其當時之急。仍保持海上覇權也。日本鑒於英國首着先鞭。亦遂急起於同年冬季。宣告禁止現金輸出一變從前之緊縮政策。而爲貨幣在國際匯兌價值之減低。以便對外輸出之增高。英國紡織工業勢力之龐大。及輸出紡織物品之巨。誠足自豪。然而遠東市塲。卒爲新興之日本所奪占。益以日本人工便宜。貨價成本較低。其在市場上之競爭力。遂漸次加强。非特香港以東瀰漫日本之經濟勢力。即由印度以至於非洲。原爲英國經濟力所支配者。今亦被日貨侵入。不易阻止。蓋日幣較英鎊爲尤低故也。</p>
<p>美國旣受英鎊跌價影響。對歐洲輸出次第減少南美關係亦見惡化而遠東有望之市場。又爲廉價日貨所充塞。在此種情况之下雖欲勉强支持其金本位制。以「反收縮」政策。維持現狀而不可得。以故羅斯福氏上臺後。不能不决然放棄金本位之堡壘。以圖解救當前之危機。恢復頽敗之市面。其效果雖尚未可知。而其勢則不得不然也。</p>
<p>此刻歐洲主要國家如法如德。皆擬死守金本位制。力事防備通貨膨脹狂潮之襲來。故英美日諸國貶低幣價之舉。在國際上得收輸出增加物價提高之效。設使世界各國皆放棄金本位制。一致減低貨幣平價。則一般所得工資與物價。同等升高。購買力之低微與現在仍無二致。而經濟前途之窒塞亦仍如故也。不過通貨膨脹實現以後。貿易自由主義。亦隨之而消亡。所謂統制通貨膨脹政策。實質上乃爲經濟的國民主義。換言之。即爲戰時統制經濟之變相也。</p>
<p>經濟旣以國家自給自足爲趨歸。一國之内。國家萬能的政治表見。以及國家界限之重新建立。更不能不突忽增大。由經濟鬭爭之推行反映於政治者遂愈嚴重。於是國際合作之說。竟成爲紙上空談。而爲外交上之應酬品矣。各國近皆集注精力。第一在軍事勢力之發展。第二在國内市場之開發第三在海外市場之維持。其事雖異。而其實則一。</p>
<p>當今軍事競爭之激烈在太平洋上爲日美之海軍競賽。在歐洲爲法德之所謂安全保障。與軍備平等之爭執。德國現正困於經濟枯渴。殊難爲軍備之實際增加。退盟之後。形勢自甚嚴重。惟日本則因戰爭投機而贏得莫大利益。近三年以來。軍事費逐年遞加。今年之軍費較諸一九三一年時幾增一倍有奇。明年度預算。較之本年恐又將增加三分之一。實數將在十三萬萬日金以上。此其所以使世界震驚。各國危懼。美國旣高倡照倫敦條約。建艦補足。以與日海軍競賽。英國亦自不甘落後。於是海軍建艦之爭。遂與通貨膨脹之爭。同其激烈。而整個世界。乃由經濟恐慌轉化而爲政治危機之爆發矣。</p>

<p>新聲社記者、昨晤豆米業同業公會顧馨一氏、據稱日本倉庫陳米運滬、由上海八家米行訂購、總數爲五萬包、訂講原因、上述八家米行、原有洋米積存、以美商漢來道洋行出售仰光洋米深恐是項洋米運滬後、市價低落、况洋米徵收進口稅、原則已通過、勢將實行、乃聯合訂購、在上海棧房交貨、</p>

<p>緣照安森氏計算之匯兌率、係每百兩規銀合美金六一·八三九元、而公司帳内、則平均每百兩只合美金三二·九零一元因之成本加巨、而收入之額、不足以有利、在此情形之下、一九三○年八月五日之函、勢難作嚴格之解釋、故須請工部局予以考慮、</p>

<p>年來國内生產之衰落、不但國内一般巨大業所需之工業原料、悉皆購自舶來、卽麥棉各項農產原料、用以製造棉紗與麫粉者、亦大都由外國輸入、如全國產棉、每年約計六百四十餘萬担、而民國二十二年度、華棉產額爲六·七九三·二四一担、美棉輸入、已達四·六五二·七二六担之多、又全國產麥、每年爲八百餘萬担、而民國二十年度輸入洋麥、亦已達二二·七七三·四二四担之多、值關銀七·六三九·三零一兩、以後趨勢、祗有增無减、其他工業原料、舉其大者、如磷塊之於火柴、硝酸曹達之於漂染、顏料之於印染、羊毛細紗之於針織、烟葉之於捲烟、每年輸入、約值海關銀三萬萬兩以上、其中關於探辦付價上之各種手續、一方旣受外滙漲落之影響、同時又有洋商托辣</p>
<p>諸目下情勢、中國究爲有生產之國家、苟能從已有者棉麥與着毛烟葉四項、先積極整理、力求進步、則欲達到自給目的、以解除經濟上一部份之壓迫、並非不可能、因棉之輸入、固占海開進口之首位、而中國棉地、亦有三五、四六八、三五二畝之多、列爲世界棉產之第二、又黄河以北淮海以西、均爲產麥中心、有四萬八千五百餘萬畝以上之面積、又如四川山東兩省產烟衆多、而羊毛又爲口北特產、祗須畜植上加以改良、同時從事奬勵、二三年後、未必再賴乎外貨、</p>

<p>▲上海隊無窮風波</p>
<p>粤五鋒極度活躍</p>
<p>滬處逆風、力持守勢、粤五鋒乘風助之威、積極進攻、中鋒李鴻清以迅雷不及掩耳手段、直闖中軍帳、李　江善敬急忙來救、李傳球與葉北華、葉　起處、被周鐵門接個正着、麥蘇胡天寳四周包圍周無法、輕輕將球推出界外、迫成角球、時正距開球五分鐘楊水益主踢、落點極佳、麥蘇趕上一脚、急如　彈　江善敬拿肉背權充籐牌、碰然一聲彈出甚遠、又被葉北華趕上、　命一踢、仍被鐵門接住、滬陣中烏烟冲大、殺得人仰馬翻、周鐵門表演神技、全塲心驚肉跳、在此十五分鐘間、滬陣無時不在驚風駭浪中討生活、</p>
<p>▲滬前鋒鼓氣進窺</p>
<p>過急切良機屢失</p>
<p>滬五鋒拚命抵抗外、仍相機進攻、一次鍾勇森獲球傳過中衛綫傳與李義臣、李傳孫錦順、孫攻打未中、球偏左出界綫、失去機會、十七分鐘後、滬又連被罰二次角球、挑至球門中心點、卒以江善敬李寗之努力、先後救出、十九分鐘梁樹棠因犯規被罰、麥蘇主踢、球位過高、竟越網出界、相差數分、否則周鐵門亦難爲力矣、二十分鐘陳家球盤球直進、傳與鍾勇森、時粤方後防空虚、急於奏功、揚脚攻門、用力過猛、又未中的、二十二分鐘粤胡天寳傳球與麥蘇、深入腹地、幸李寗趕到、拚命救出、但終被李鴻清截住、再度攻門、鐵門接球以風大失手、復迫成角球、揚水益主踢、江善敬還以大脚、球始飛入粤陣、未幾又飛至滬方、激戰至烈、</p>
<p>▲周鐵門風頭大健</p>
<p>粤虎將難越雷池</p>
<p>卅二分鐘粤用短距離傳遞術、穿入腹地胡天寳撩起一脚、周賢言撲地救出姿熊絶美、滬方復大反攻、孫錦　奮勇殺敵、幸李天生由半空殺出、斜角出界、兩隊一斱場混戰、鐵門小心翼翼、時時呌小江切勿遠離、終上半時、爲零比零、雙方無勝負、球怱去怱來、苦了陳去祥一雙腿、奔跑不停是最苦差使、休息時間滬領隊余衡之、面授機宜、粤敎練亦召集健兒、切切私語、下半時易地作戰、滬順風並以陳洪光易陳家球、開始接足球錦標上海隊（王開攝）</p>
<p>觸後、粤仍極盛圍攻滬門、鐵門左擋右撥、四次撲地、七次接球、致粤軍始終不能越雷池一步、表演之佳、得未曾有、全局彩聲電動風頭健極、</p>
<h3 id="c189">中三元滬隊凱旋　主席金戈移上海 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>十分鐘粤勇將麥蘇在滬門邊旁受傷、倒地不起、經救護出塲、易以朱國倫粤勢爲之一挫、滬乘機奮起、李　臣率領大小兒郎直奔粤方、勢如推山倒海、銳不可當、李天生以極豐富之經騐最乾凈之脚頭、應付時艱、頗感吃力、至第廿六分鐘時、李義臣將球派與孫錦順、孫趕上脚、粤守門遠出救球未能接住、球遂輕輕入網、首開紀錄、全塲歡呼、滬隊欣喜欲狂聲勢更振、粤努力反攻、終不得志、老卅分鐘、鍾勇森得球飛奔、急用遠球傳與萬象華、萬復派與孫錦順、守門心慌意亂、又打中一球、成二對零、粤大勢已去、莫能挽回、至卅七分鐘李義臣又獲一球、兹後粤方　　險球總算不再失手、下半時、三對零、滬勝、滬遂以三對零之、紀錄、獲本屆足球錦標國府林主席之輝煌金戈、移往上海軍中、保持下屆大會、再見高下、</p>

<p>至對兩隊球藝而論、粤方五鋒之連絡傳遞、及頭</p>
<p>上功夫、確非滬隊能及、後衛李天生八面威風、亦非同小可、其弱點乃在中衛綫稍爲較弱、守門尤不佳、說技術更談不到、粤兩次足球過失、均在守門、滬隊人才平均、五鋒在粤軍嚴重監視下、殊有極　抬頭之勢、尤其是萬象華遇到李天生、眞是一帖藥、絲毫動彈不得、中衛内衛均極稱職、孫李兩位更是救駕大臣、提起鐵門、周君這場功勞、當然是第一大功、守門技術已趨神妙化、否則至少要輸三五球、慶功宴就、不能坐了、　　▲上海隊</p>

<p>雙打四川棄權</p>
<p>▲王春菁穩取鮑大經　山西網球姊妹花、王春菁春葳兩選手、自初次兩賽後頭角大露、王春菁　網　當、遠抽亦佳、第一單打舉行之初、力殺三關第四局鮑大經以快球圖利、扳轉一局、成三與一之比、王春菁見來勢頗兇、以遠交近攻之術使鮑師老受困、遂以六比三勝第一盤、第二盤雙方振足精神、川將以先失一盤、趕緊加油、戰來頗具精彩、自各一而成各三、角逐之烈、以此爲最、次局晋王遠勝、但不久又爲川將趕成平局、鮑大經火冒非常、惟晋王動以底綫抽　、平穩無疵、終難得逞、於六比六時、王春菁突然異軍突起、連獲二局、以八比六勝第二盤、</p>
<p>▲王春葳智勝黎玉品　第二單打晋王春葳對川黎玉品、上塲伊始、兩軍實力平衡、黎富於經騐、王利於智巧、可謂門當户對、川將發球得力王頗苦於招架、川黎以六比四先聲奪人、勝第一盤、山西小姐不甘示弱、第二盤中接起逞能、黎玉品爲之泰然、屢以聲東擊西之術、使王　於奔命、王年壯身肥、不善奔跑、但漸精神奮發、極力挽回殆局竟以七與五之比造成各一、單績頗險、第三盤全局命脈、爲兵家所必爭、王小姐計上心來、以滑四連勝二局、黎玉品見風頭不妙、亦以巧妙之　截還他顏色、滑勝一局、如此掙扎、甚久各不力殺、而側重力守、惟晋王於機會到時從不輕易放過、　趕甚緊、遂以六比三下第三盤、山西獲得本屆女網球錦標、</p>

<p>國手之爭　邱飛海力勝林寳華</p>
<p>（南京十九日電）十九晨男網球决賽、滬對川、單雙打同時於九時起舉行、是晨九時各塲均無比賽、故觀者特多不下三四千人、未至八時、網球塲上已滿坑滿谷每至表演精彩之處、掌聲四起、而尤以第一單打滬邱飛海對川林寳華之戰、最引人注目、蓋邱曾敗於巴城許承基、而林則於十八表演賽中勝許承基、是以此賽不啻網球國手之爭、咸欲一探究竟以定高下、結果邱以三比一盤勝林、第二單打滬王文正對川錢耀彬、競爭亦頗劇烈、結果三亦以三比一盤勝錢雙打滬鄭兆佳余田光對川鄭祖駒李南、雙方實力懸殊、鄭余以直落三勝、甚爲容易、總計滬以三對零勝川、而得冠軍、各組比賽如下、</p>

<p>▲鋒芒一時　首盤開始、邱先發球、卽獲首局、林亦照樣回敬、成各一平手、繼林連得兩局、以三比　局遙佔上風、邱急起直追、扳回發球局、但林亦以滑四再勝兩局、林以五比三局遙前導、邱不甘示弱追回兩局、造成各五局面、邱發球失利以五比六局再居下風、而下局邱三　野球送去第一盤、</p>
<p>▲畢竟不凡　第二盤起、邱大下决心、努力反攻、果然一帆風順、氣呑山海、林雖竭力抵抗、終鮮成效被邱一局復一局、連下五關、最後一局、林一記　殺、邱遂以光盤凈勝、</p>
<p>▲後來居上　林自上盤慘敗、知非力敵不可、乃第三盤開始、卽大施壓迫、聲東擊西、以滑四連勝兩局、</p>
<p>邱見來勢洶洶非智取不足見效、果然旗開得勝、馬到成功、亦以滑四顯還顏色遂成各二平手、嗣後兩人各失發球局直至四四和局、第九局邱發球居然轉換風頭獲得勝利、以五比四領前、下局爲生死關頭、各自小心防衛、但林發球較有把握故先以四十對十五佔絶對優勢、然邱亦得知此局之重要、豈肯輕易放鬆、果然揮拍力敵、四川網球選手林寳華</p>
<p>追成平手繼又幾次平手　林卒再以自殺失敗、邱遂以二比一盤後來居上、顯他顏色、</p>
<p>▲最後勝利　　檬過後、再戰聲起、是時兩人均筋皮力盡、而林則因連失兩盤、時露焦急、舉動慌張、致失誤累累、而邱仍鎭定異常、不露聲色、雖一度脚筋作祟、但仍舊勇進攻、開賽之初、邱卽以四比局佔優、林雖屬作反攻挽回兩局、但大勢已去、徒喚奈何、最後林再現自殺以三比六失第四盤、總計邱以三比一盤獲得最後勝利、</p>
<p>▲幸的問題　　觀兩人球藝、各有短長、實難分軒輊、林則發球峻急、欄網神妙、邱則長袖有勁、穩健有加、而林最大之弊病、卽未脫盡火氣、十九日之敗、職此之由、總之兩人技術相若、皆爲吾國之網　名手、得失勝敗由於有幸有不幸也、</p>

<p>（南京十九日電）男子籃球比賽河北以四九比三十打敗上海、奪得錦標、冀連絡純熱之至、後衛張景德能攻能守尤可矯健、上海旣失地利、又失人和、遠不及在滬時之勇敢善戰而以前鋒之不能退守爲失利之最大原因、上半時結果河北以十八比十勝、下半時開始上海陳祥龍上陣、形勢一變緊緊追隨、至十八比二十、河北只勝二分但　睡間河北又復得勢、于敬孝累建奇功、結果河北四十九上海三十、河北得第二屆全運會籃球錦標、</p>
<p>男子籃球錦標河北隊</p>
<p>▲兩隊各有神能　河北有唐寳堃之接濟于敬孝之神勇、張景實之絶技、上海有陸鍾恩之謀、馮念華之快、吴國霖之神妙投射、各有所長、戰爭劇烈、惜乎裁判未能盡善、未免美中不足耳、結果河北以四十九比三十勝、奪得錦標、比賽詳情、綜述於後、</p>
<p>▲河北下馬威風　兩陣對圓、各各　劍弩張、準備厮殺、宋君復佟復然、胡笳一聲戰端爆發、河北張景實、得唐寳堃球、邁涉前進、吴國霖未立功、先犯大過、河北罰得、一分、張景惠再度進兵、又告中的、吴國霖罪立功、造成三二比數、河北幾度短傳、張景實三拔敵幟、于敬孝中路興師、亦立功、招壽昌阻馮念華籃下投擲、二罰一中、錢敬鏞不盡厥貴施施從外來、張景實迅雷不及掩耳、四破敵營、招壽昌西路發難、馮念華救駕過猛、河北又得一分、唐寳堃犯規、錢敬鏞安然得利、</p>
<p>▲上海見勢不佳　高呌免戰、冀聲勢依然再戰聲起、錢敬鏞得馮念華底線傳球、破籃入網上海二度反攻、馮念華籃下失機、唐寳堃並不回守、燬壞暗伏籃下、招壽昌覷個親切、遠遠傳球、唐寳堃坐得漁利、吴國霞施展神技、方直入、錢敬鏞守土失賣、張景寳如脫覊之馬、得唐寳堃　線傳球、反手一舉、又得二分、錢敬鏞志圖報回、運球前進、張景寳　肯放棄、横阻犯規、陸鍾恩反身拍出、錢敬鏞空中射擊、居然中的、河北前鋒、連絡前進、吴國霞來回防次、陸鍾恩顧此失彼、沈聿恭巧取一球、馮念華得孫寳慶球、直居籃下、張景實心中不甘、用力一推、檢秦佟復然遲疑久久、判作犯規、但亦各無所獲、上半時結果、河北十六、上海十</p>
<p>▲上海功虧一簣　易地再戰、錢敬鏞行動遲緩、張景實首取二分、老將陳祥龍、不禁大怒、按甲上陣、果然聲勢大盛、馮念華巧避招壽昌、打個正着、頓時滑如泥湫活潑無比、陣祥龍跳下一球、馮念華一舉成功、劉振元換下沈聿恭、上場卽告犯規、馮念華再得一分、唐寳堃急回本陣、亦復犯規、陸鍾恩亦中雀屏、於是上海以十八比二十六、以二分落後、</p>
<p>▲河北一瀉千里　上海方　再上一層、反敗爲勝、不意張景實又復活躍、取得二分、上海隊屢次進攻、裁判特别靈敏、犯規纍纍、于敬孝丨投一罰、唐寳堃跟上一球、陸鍾恩大將身手人叢中奪回二分、而于敬孝中路興師陳祥龍擋之無效、唐寳堃接于敬孝球、就在空中一投、居然洪福齊天、亦得一分、陳祥龍馮念華、二路扳回三球、何奈唐寳堃終是福將、一擲二擲、又見功績、錢敬鏞再度入陣、無補大局、只見河北人馬縱横、精神抖擻、孫寳慶因張景實犯規、罰球未中、因禍得福、反得二分、張景實四次犯規、不意記錄、並未察及、居然又得四分河北遂以四九比二十勝上海、</p>
<p>▲談論雙方球藝　河北陸皆是河兒、連絡尤極可取、張景實退守進攻俱合法度、唐寳堃接濟有方　果然高人一等、上海隊慣於户内作戰、用球亦非習慣、地形上先打折扣、加之錢敬鏞退守無方、使後衛防守爲難、陸踴恩看守有功、雖投擲大不準、沈聿恭亦未得逞、論球藝河北連絡較勝一籌、</p>

<p>▲結果四比一勝河北</p>
<p>粤隊投手高萬恩功夫極佳</p>
<p>四局粤動武經排解方續賽</p>
<p>（南京十九日電）男棒球决賽、粤對冀、粤先攻、形勢緊張、前五局各無紀錄、第六局上、粤伍舜德安打、加以冀接手决誤、被粤連得三分、冀力抗、聲勢豪甚、三壘滿佔粤防禦森嚴、僅由梁瑞麒得一分、第九局粤又加一分、結果粤四比一勝奪得錦標、粤投手高萬恩功夫極佳、冀無生路、當第四局上、粤冀球員動武、全隊圍打冀首壘馮道源、經裁判及冀職員極力排解、始繼續比賽、賽畢、冀欲圖報復、要求憲兵勿加干涉、憲兵未允、防衛甚嚴卒未滋事、</p>
<p>▲林金友一條鐵臂　粤投手林金友、生就一條鐵臂練就全臂功夫、手指管束力强、球之弧性甚足、使冀毫無生路、九局中冀連受三振下場者、共有九人之多、而四球得壘、僅放過一次耳、第六局粤得二分後、冀力謀反攻、三壘滿佔、金運足勁道大顯妙投、果然神乎其技、冀僅得一分、結果遂使粤以四比一勝、奪得錦標、</p>
<p>▲前三局堅持無功　粤先攻、開始一二三、連殺均未得壘、冀亦然、首局平安過去、粤兩人連下、程觀潔安打、黄允葆高球下場、又無所得、冀困於嚴防、三人連下、第二局仍無紀錄、第三局粤二人下場、後、毛連貴乘首壘之錯誤、而得壘、再進三壘、形勢忽然緊張、但伍舜得打出高球、游擊反身妙接、粤依舊未得、冀羅宗强力政形、才各以三振下場、大勢乃去、前三局中雙方佈陣周寗無隙可乘、</p>
<p>▲全武行聲勢兇兇　第四局起、忽生糾紛、粤高漢思擊球、三壘截得、投送首壘球先高而到、高乃下場、但高仍猛力向首壘衝去、身撞冀首壘員馮道源、馮言語責之高不分皂白、飽以老拳、粤其他球員、亦　擁而上、向馮下總攻擊、一時形勢嚴重、十分可怕、幸冀其他球員、深明大義、不加入戰團、裁判員等力事排解、始得繼續比賽、</p>
<p>棒球錦標廣東隊　（王開攝）</p>
<p>▲林金友出場無功　程觀潔、四球得壘、黄允葆高球下場又無建樹、　攻、顧培林高球、被二壘接殺、關福納徼倖得壘、關福照打出不遠、球爲三壘截住、送二壘、再送壘、演一雙合殺、冀一籌莫展、</p>
<p>▲第三局各顯妙技　第五局粤黄兆熊、飛球出壘繼偷渡一點、李炯堃三振下塲、毛連貴四球得壘、似有青　直上之勢、但陳光明擊球未遠、三壘得球、得二壘、再傳首壘、冀亦演　合殺、使粤徒費心血耳、冀羅宗興中途被殺、鮑文沛馮道源被窘、粤投手林金友之弧球、均以三振下塲、徒呼負負、五局終了、各無紀錄、形勢之緊張、不言可知、</p>
<p>▲粤聲勢突然振作　第六局起、粤忽然得手、氣焰如熾、冀　手接手、失於慌疏、連負三分、種下致命之　伍舜德争球射出左外場高漢恩尾後得壘、林金友四球登站、伍已至三壘、於是滿佈各站、程觀潔送伍高歸陣、林至二壘被殺、黄允葆三振被殺、黄兆熊又送程歸陣、粤乃得三分、李炯堃飛球下場、局面乃換、冀猝遭重創、不甘屈伏、隊長密阌韜略、力圖反攻、但羅宗强上場卽下、幸梁端麒出安打、方政才不勞而獲、時梁已偷至三壘、顧培林亦出安打、梁乃歸陣、扳回一分、方偷渡三壘後、又不甘心、冒險歸陣、卒被六人包圍夾殺、大勢乃下、關福納復吃三振而下塲、粤乃以三比一佔優、</p>
<p>▲最後結果四比一　此局雙方各經滄桑、事後乃格外小心、粤毛連貴雖四球登站但至二壘被殺陳光民又無功而下伍、舜德則吃三振換塲、粤見風勢轉機、精神益旺投手功夫亦愈出愈妙、連投三打數、共殺二人、冀又負足而下、第八局粤高漢恩、曾至三壘、但後繼未看、不得乘、冀三人連一、乃作最後掙扎、粤李炯堃乘游擊與首壘之誤、由陳兌民安打送歸、遂再加一分、冀方政才又吃三振顧培林着球、意外得壘、然至　壘卽死關福納雖出遠球、仍無建樹比賽乃終、粤以四比一錦勝、奪得標、粤共得安打五記、冀僅二次各局比數僅第六局、粤三冀一、第九局粤一、</p>

<p>第四局天雨濛濛、上海小姐明知上局錯誤、過不憚改竭、力驕正、而態度亦益　鎭、靜王雪華發球、彷彿迫擊砲之接續追殺、一氣呵成、北平小姐永永促處於砲彈之下、連獲十二分之多、平軍果屬刦餘哀鴻、而、王小姐已臂痛欲斷、嗣平厘務珊托球送至前排、輕割殺死狀仍無進展、以二十一比九終局、上海女將歡天喜地、獲得錦標、</p>

<p>▲下屆全運在瀋陽運動場舉行</p>
<p>▲總錦標是恢復東北河山顏色</p>
<p>全體同志同胞、大會閉幕矣、諸位各個有家歸去、我們還是隨地漂流、還十日盛會中的我們、的確像碎船下的殘生得以復見故里家園、重親兄弟姊妹、欣幸無量、所以這首　的一草一木、都像對我們含着無限的感情、諸位的一言一笑、都似對我們有深厚的意味、眞的、諸位的握手、醫</p>
<p>好了不少我們的破碎精神、諸位的掌聲、加强了許多我們的奮鬥意志、我們實在是惜别、然而國家正在需要同志們各自去努力、生命都可以不惜、别離又算了什麽、諸位、再見吧、秋風多厲、珍重、珍重、</p>
<p>諸位凱旋帶回去的勝利品、或是五尺金戈、或是錦標銀盾、請猜猜我們帶回去的是什麽寳貝曰「希望」、「信心」、我們看諸位團體合作的精神、龍騰虎躍的體魄、的確足使中國有希望的、所以我們願這運動塲上所表現的團體精神能普及到各界、能振起民族的力量、我們不僅希望土地不至再失、確可希望還我大好河山、我們再看看諸位所造成的驚人紀錄、我們愈相相凡他人所能的、我們無不能、所謂「彼人也、我人也、有爲者亦若是、」祇在自己努力耳、日本人能滅國　輩豈不能復之、所以我們由運動塲上帶回來的紀念是「有諸位在、東北不亡、」「有諸位在、東北必强、」的信念、至於我們自己、當然要站在最前線上去努力、</p>

<p>我們的第二創痕、是認識自己的責任、談國難的每好歸罪於某幾個人、或某一個黨派、實在說除了終日勤作的好百姓外、那一個人不負相當的責任、我們流離南北、常聽些怨天尤人聲音、少看見吾盡吾責捨我其誰的勇士、多是功則歸己罪則歸人、國仇可以不管、私恨不能不報、習非成是、日本人縱不來亡我、我們又豈能幸免、納耳遜名言說、「英國要人人各盡其責」、諸位、中國今日誠要人人各盡其責矣、我們要有此認識、來改造自己、來復興國家、</p>
<p>我們的覺悟與認識、是由國家受空前的犧牲、自身受莫大的痛苦得來的、代價太大了、我們送給諸位帶回去、分贈給人人、勸他們不必付同樣的代價了、唉、亡國的滋味、實在是不可嘗試的、本來民族的文野興亡、全看他們能否互換經騐、我們所受的慘禍、盼望足夠同胞們借鑑了、若是全國青年都能認識己責、我們的希望、一定完成、</p>
<p>我們的信心、一定實現、最後我們熱烈的希望着、虔誠的祈禱着、下次中華民國全國運動大會、在瀋陽北陵運動塲上去舉行、下次中華民國全國運動大會的總錦標、是恢復東北河山的顏色、我們這次來、備受政府當局與各界同胞的同情及援助、我們願就此替我們自己及東北體育恊進會掬誠掬誠鳴謝、遼吉黑熱哈五省區選手敢叩、二十二年十月二十日南京、</p>

<h3 id="c232">三寳下西洋 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>前永樂派鄭和入南海，使中國和南洋羣島的交通，加一辕興味；便南洋人對於中國，多一點認識，還是狠有價值的一回事。依我的推測，這故事流傳的久遠，倒是　着民間傳說的加油添醬，那部　傳小說「三寳太監下西洋」並不怎樣有力，因爲他描寫的　　，太不高明，所以影響極小。</p>
<p>據留居爪哇暹羅有五年之久的許雲樵君來信說，南洋各處對於三寳的神話，非常之多，並且稱他三寳公，塑象，立廟，去紀念她。比張騫班超在西域所遺留的印象，來得偉大。但是中國關於三寳的記載，除　明史宦官傳，有幾頁質撲的表功以外，什麽都没有了。没有後援的殖民，始終是要受排擠的，大而無當的懷柔政策，那莫比得上人家的五印度公司的有計晝，有組織，有手段。珊瑚九島的爭辯，眞是　掉了竹排，想撈「火通」竿子。</p>
<p>汪日昇的臺灣外紀說，永樂差太監王三寳下西洋，把鄭和的小名，和他的同伴王景先和姓，總夾在一起了。他又說荷蘭國人向三寳要海船的圖樣，三寳恐怕他有了海船，要騷擾邊疆，故意拿一枝破筆畫一個扁圓，中間自首至尾直竪二三節，將筆毛刷開，亂劃幾畫與他。荷蘭人就照樣製造，所有筆毛一　，安繩一條，作爲船中索路，結果比中國的海船反而監牢。這一件傳說，幼稚得很，現在稍知荷蘭的殖民史的，大槪見了都要發笑的。不過他說鄭成功爲了受副於清兵，纔趕去荷蘭人而占台灣，却是事實。並且寫得有聲有色。</p>
<p>明史三　作「三保」，可是無論小說，無論南洋的史蹟，都作三寳了。這是無關重要的。不過把南洋纏夾成西洋，未免可笑。這是時代關係，也不能深怪的。中國人只知道普陀山是在南海，自然腦筋中從來没有過天府的南洋了。</p>
<h3 id="c233">會客室 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>招待室，應接室，會客室，都是接見賓客的所在，有　不曰室，而名廳者，那麽比較室在字義上範圍大了一些；我們知道一個會客室，却能分析許多性質，有神秘的，公開的，有甜蜜的，酸苦的，在會客室裏，能彀表演形形色色的悲歡離合劇！能彀表演花花綠綠的喜怒哀樂劇！每一個機關或是團體，會客室是個中心的建設，機關團體主人，都要曲意經營一下；各就性質之所近，要把牠陳列得花團錦簇，比較接近的賓客，更要延入自己辦公室，舊官塲中敎做簽押房。</p>
<p>譬如是個學校的話，便少了一塊「親愛精誠」，「智仁勇」，這一類的横額成訓，校長放大攝影，學生畢業照片，都是其間的點綴；亮晶晶的銀拜銀瓶，越是光彩逼人逼得厲害，越顯他們運動成績優良，有不斷的新陳代謝的運動員；見到多是黨國要人致送的玻璃鏡架子，也可以表示他們獲奬的次數多；悲歡離合雜劇的演奏，也產生在學校的會客室，悲，是情人送情人讀書，互相珍重道别的一刹那，歡，星期六，星期日，是學校普通規定的會客時間，伊們本來演著分别一日，如隔三秋的苦劇，欣逢會面，自然要有無限歡娱，看電影，吃西餐，還有盡在不言中的種種；至於離與合，也是伊們在會客室想像得到的，相見恨少！胡爲越宿分襟？懷念正深！不期邂逅欣逢？這一類的情節了；從前我聽到有個抖亂男子，到一所女校看愛人，司閽的故作艱難，要他給些賄賂，抖亂男子，心地明白，把張五元鈔票，輕輕放在茶杯底下，這椿會客室秘密，嗣後便傳遍那個學校。</p>
<p>官塲中的會客，人物越大，越不易求見得到，他們會客室，少不了兩名勤務兵，或是吃人不吐骨的聽差，他們權要在手，能玩賓客於掌握；大人物求見的客多了，大槪是以名剌先後爲接見的次序，你不給應差的一些小惠，他把你名剌隨　顚倒，大人物過了會客時間，便要拂袖而入；此中喜怒哀樂？只要看來賓出衙門的面部，就能彀了然於胸；如果ＸＸ長，ＸＸ主席，把這客請到辦公室去見的話，這客出門，准要逢人吹牛，ＸＸ長，ＸＸ主席，對我特别青睞；其實自古迄今，上司的一副臉孔，本不好看，所以無怪當年陶淵明，憤憤地說；「不爲五斗米折腰」咧。</p>
<h3 id="c234">哭 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>「男兒有淚不輕彈。」這句話是說男子眼淚，不到忍無可忍的辰光，决不會使「淚濕青衫袖」的。</p>
<p>可是女子却不然了，哭是伊們的擅長，所以一家人家死了人，孝幃裏總要找幾個善哭的女子守孝幃，伊們一見到有客人來弔，就嗚嗚咽咽地哭泣起來了，等得弔客行了禮之後，伊們就立刻止住了哭，在那裏有說有笑了。那有一些些悲哀繞心呢？</p>
<p>更有女兒將要出嫁的時候，花轎是臨門了，新嫁娘却在那裏嗚嗚啜泣，捨不得離開自家的墻門，但是等到三朝回門，又是有說有笑了，那時新嫁娘的心中，我不知是悲是樂？</p>
<p>尚有夫婦倆因了一些細故　生口角，男的强駁了幾聲，伊們只得哭了，要使你們男子軟化，否則就玩一哭，二餓，三上吊的把戲，駭得你倒躱倒躱！這些哭都是虚僞的哭。</p>
<p>小孩子不如他的意，他會哭，哭了你們會依他的，他知道哭有這樣的偉大能力，以後就以哭爲要挾！</p>
<p>所以我覺得要使男子的「淚濕青衫袖」眞不容易呢，除了有少數男子在父母棄養時洒些思親之淚，情人遠别一掬别離之淚，簡直是没有見到男子放聲大哭。所以有　　哭都是虚僞的哭！</p>

<p>— 言</p>
<p>說到依茄華雷司</p>
<p>最近幾年來，歐美小說界中，最能博得觀衆們贊美的優良收穫，已不是那些專讀戀愛和敎人家怎樣吊膀子的作品了，而是　部富打剌激性的短篇偵探小說。其中，英吉利大小說家依茄華雷司，便是最成功的一個。</p>
<p>觀衆的嗜好的轉愛，不有說，當然是受了租界風雲的影響。大凡稍有一些見地的人，都知道奮鬥和掙扎才是今後一切人，一切集團的唯一出路；所以他們絶對不願意再把寳貴的光陰，去消磨在軟性讀物的上面了。他們所需要的是熱血的激動，胆氣得磨礪，勇敢的養成。於是，依茄華雷司得「四義士」一書，便因符合這種種的條件的緣故，被推爲近三年英國文壇上的第一部榮譽作了。</p>
<p>這部書最近已由秦瘦鷗君譯成華文，（由上海及各地中國旅行社代售）我雖然不願意恭維他，但是我敢絶不虚僞的說，他並不曾把原書的優點損耗過，眞像原文一樣的緊張，剌激，興奮！</p>
<p>我很希望這一部英國人的作品，能夠喚醒我們這些無靈魂者的迷夢，更希望不久的將來，在我們自己的文壇上，也能有像這樣富於「力的美」的作品出現。</p>

<p>關耀武是兒女成羣，讓家庭累夠了。可是捨也捨不得丢開。老田是未婚夫婦，打得火一樣熱。我呢，實在不能算是有什麽男女之間的關係的。千不該，萬不該，不該槍着在這個日子和楊家姑娘訂了婚，於今抛開人家走去，心裏總未免緊了個疙瘩在這裏，假使和桂枝没有這種婚約，那就來去坦然。雖說還有這樣大年紀的一個父親，可是他向來鼓勵兒子出兵打仗的，他總是這樣說着，養兵千日，用在一朝、眞是出發了，他心裏儘管萬分捨不得，可是到了現在情形之下，就是說贊成兩個字，恐怕也有些不好意思，因爲他要說贊成的話，就是把人家楊家的姑娘來開玩笑，我走了以後，揚家母女，益發的要在他面前說閑話，他更不容易對付了。想到了這裏，就也不免得自己老父發愁一陣，心灰意懶的也就理願回連部了，且去看看關耀武的態度怎麽樣。心裏想着，一會兒便到了關連。在房門外向裏一看，只見他横躺在自己屋裏，那張小床上，面向上仰着，兩條腿都埀在床下。他兩隻手環在胸面前，也不知道拿了一根什麽東西在手上，兩隻手兩個食指只管旋轉不已。便笑道：喝！老關，你倒這樣的自在。關耀武一個翻身坐了起來，笑道：你猛可的說上一句，倒嚇了我一跳。趙自强走進屋子來道：你的心到那裏去了，我說這樣一句輕鬆的話，你都會嚇上一跳。關耀武道：可不是，我現在是個喪魂失魄的人了。說着，呵呵一笑，兩手互相搓個不了，表示一　麻煩不了的神氣，要在這搓手的當兒給他完全發洩出去。（二一七）</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>世界上只有男人去化幾錢看女人模特兒，没有女人看男人模特兒的：女人就是偶然見到一個不穿褲子的男人，總是像見了一條大蛇似的怕得跑了。然而，今天晚上却是例外。是個衖堂裏的女人不但没有跑，反而一個個全站了起來，伸長了脖子看那個不穿褲子的男人。我奇極了。</p>
<p>「𪡊：：：喔：：：」那個不穿褲子的男子嚷了起來。「哈哈，這麽許多浪蹄子，你們要瞧麽？我就没有穿褲子啊。哈，哈，哈！𪡊：：：喔······」</p>
<p>「啊，就是他。」我不禁脫口　呼着。同時，我想起一個星期前的一個夜裏的情形。</p>
<p>那個人才往衖堂口跑了幾步，便給三個男人拉着；另外一個女人替他穿好了褲子。</p>
<p>「不成，小房子，我得去找那個小兎　子，你們不能拉着我。𪡊：：：喔：：：小舅子，惡有惡報，别那麽很，知道了麽？吠閃開，小子們帶馬去找小兎蕙子！𪡊：：：喔：：：：」</p>
<p>「你們三個人跟着他去轉一個圈子就回來，别惹禍，小心點兒。」那個女人說。</p>
<p>於是，連着愛　閡事的一共有十幾個人簇擁着他去了。</p>
<p>一這是怎麽一回事兒？我才打算回家去問妻，聽見在我旁邊的一個青年這樣問一個三十幾歲的女人，便站着往下聽。</p>
<p>「他姓什麽我可不知道，只聽見人呌他坤山：：：」</p>
<p>「坤山？他準姓黄。打「花會」去。黄坤山，一個老虎。」一個小孩子捕嘴說。</p>
<p>「坤山有一次生病，没有上船，他待在家裏的日子一多，就從朋友那兒聽到他的換帖哥哥做寃大頭這一回事兒。起初他還不相信，可是　三四個人在他面前這麽一說，心裏可就不能不有點兒疑惑了。派人去打聽了幾天，眞是事實。等姓張的回來了以後，一五一十的告訴了他。他當時很氣。不料那個女人的米湯灌得勁兒是，第二天反而埋怨坤山說，坤山不該破壞他的名譽。坤山聽了，不過一笑。那個女人可就不饒過坤山啦，只管在姓張的面前說坤山有搶他的位置的心，還是乘早把坤山的位置給了她兄弟，免得將來遭了别人的　手：末的，伊又說，他不信，可以四處去打聽。姓張的一打聽，果然是的。其實，這全是那個女人和伊的漢子預先安排好的。所以下班輪船開的時候，船上少了一個坤山，却多了那個女人的兄弟！也就是坤山嘴裏嚷的那個小舅子啦。</p>
<p>「那時，坤山的病還没有好，加上丢了差事的一氣，人該瘋了。到現在已經做了三四年的瘋子了。一天到晚的不給他吃，不給他喝，他也不吃，不喝；吃的時候，你給他吃上四五大碗，他也吃得下。隨便在那兒，滿地的拉屎撤尿，只苦了他的老婆（就是那個替他穿褲子的女人）簡直不是過的人的日子。平時，坤山不什麽說話，像一個啞子，心裏想起了什麽，就嚷上一夜。或者到外面來跑一趟，說是一捉拿小舅子去。」剛才拉着他的三個男人全是他的兒子；三個人每月賺的錢還不少，倒挺孝順他們的爸爸，可見善有善報：：；」</p>
<p>「𪡊：：：喔：：：吠，閃開，捉得小舅子來也也！𪡊：：：喔：：；」</p>
<p>十幾個人簇擁着他回來了。</p>
<p>我目送他進了門，腦膜上突然映着兩個字：瘋子。</p>

<h3 id="c238">黄禍 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 尤剛</p>
<p>現在的所謂「黄禍」，我們自己是在指黄河决口了，但三十年前，並不如此。那時是解作黄色人種將要席捲歐洲的意思的，有些英雄聽到了這句話，恰如聽得被白人恭維爲「睡獅」一樣，得意了好幾年，凖備着去做歐洲的主子。不過「黄禍」這故事的來源，却又和我們所幻想的不同，是出于德皇威廉的。他還畫了一幅圖，是一個羅馬裝束的武士，在抵禦着由東方西來的一個人，但那人並不是孔子，倒是佛陀，中國人實在是空歡喜。所以我們一面在做「黄禍」的夢，而有一個人在德國治下的青島所見的現實，却是一個苦孩弄髒了電柱，就被白色巡捕提着脚，像中國人的對付鴨子一樣，倒提而去了。</p>
<p>現在希特拉的排斥非日耳曼民族思想，方法是和德皇一樣的。</p>
<p>德皇的所謂「黄禍」，我們現在是不再夢想了，連「睡獅」也不再提起，「地大物博，人口衆多」，文章上也不很見。倘是獅子，自誇怎樣肥大是不妨事的，但如果是一口猪或一匹羊，肥大倒不是好兆頭。我不知我們自己覺得現在好像是什麽了？</p>
<p>我們似乎不再想，也尋不出什麽「象徵」來，我們正在看海京伯的猛獸戲，賞鑒獅虎喫牛肉，聽說每天要喫一隻牛。我們佩服國聯的制裁日本，我們看不起國聯的不能制裁日本；我們贊成軍縮的「保護和平」，我們也佩服希特拉的退出軍縮；我們怕别國以中國爲戰塲，我們也憎惡非戰大會。我們似乎依然是「睡獅」。</p>
<p>「黄禍」可以一轉而爲「福」，醒了的獅子也會做戲的。歐洲大戰時，我們有替人拚命的工人，青島被佔了，我們有可以倒提的孩子。</p>
<p>但倘說，二十世紀的舞臺上没有我們的份，是合理的。</p>
<h3 id="c239">一點異議 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>施蟄存先生悲今之青年作文語彙不豐而勸讀「莊子」「文選」，我竊有異議。我以爲語彙之豐嗇，實由於常識的充缺，根本上，是由於實際生活經騐的多寡，單是讀某幾本書，是枉然的。「莊子」之文，是莊周的哲學思想和實際知識所產生，他的「養生主」中「庖丁解牛」一節，描寫解牛，語彙可謂豐矣，試問施先生，他的這些語彙，是讀何書而來，豈是不曾仔細地觀察過解年的人所能有？一般的讀者，在今日要把莊子的文章中的字面弄清楚，已要化大工夫，而且若無别種基礎知識，則許多篇章便根本不能理解，試問還能把其中的辭彙供自己的驅策否？至於「文選，」收羅的作者旣夥，其中所包含的實際知識尤廣，故語彙更爲豐富，但那些語彙，也决不是讀了什麽書而得來，多半是作者根據實際知識而創作出來的。試看語彙最富斩三都兩京等賦，就可知道。</p>
<p>古人不必賴前人書，而能自創新語，今人知識易求，生活更繁，反而要從前人書中去找語彙，這種根據退化論的意見，青年人看了不知當作何想？不必很古的人，即唐宋以後，還有人懂得太史公文章有奇氣，是名山大川所助成，而今人就以爲「莊子」「文選」是萬世的模範讀本了。</p>
<p>近來中國人的作品，語彙也實在貧乏，不及外國作品遠甚。但這個緣故，在乎中國人的基礎知識不夠，而外國人，則因所受的敎育完全，或所經的生活豐富，所以作品纔那麽充實。高爾基的作品之偉大，是受「見得多」之賜，至於俄國的「莊子」「文選」，則於他影響實少。</p>
<p>要描寫工廠者，進工廠去，要描寫農村者，往農村去，懂得植物學的人來描寫樹木懂得天文學的人來描寫天空，那麽語彙自能豐富，比喻自能貼切，形容自能佳妙。比讀過「莊子」「文選」的一定好得多多。許多人注意到魯迅作品中的舊文學的影響，然而爲什麽不再看出那裏面的自然科學的影響和實際生活的經騐呢？</p>
<p>施蟄存先生那樣的文學者，誠然是以語彙—　—從古文中找來的語彙—　—之富見長的。但語彙是形式的，我們的文學作品，内容比形式更要緊，與其欣賞彫琢的，禯纎的然而内容空洞的東西，我們寗可看内容充實而形式粗疎的作品。　　和政治的形態一般，今日的文壇的規矩也漸漸嚴格起來，青年的各方面的創造活動，有意或無意地有人出來限制。文壇上的「導師」制，又將恢復起來了。「烏乎。予欲慕古人之能創兮，予命弗丁其時。予欲因今人之所因兮，予獲然而恥之。」（龔自珍文體箴）</p>

<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>—兼示豐之餘先生</p>
<p>烈文兄：</p>
<p>那天電車上怱怱一晤，我因爲要到民九社書舖去買一本看中意了的書，所以在王家沙下車了。但那本書終於因價錢不合，没有買到，徒然失去了一個與你多談一刻的機會，甚悵悵。</p>
<p>關於「莊子與文選」問題，我决不再想說什麽話。本來我當時塡寫大晚報編輯部寄來的那張表格的時候，並不含有如豐先生的意見所看出來的那樣嚴肅。我並不說每一個青年必須看這兩部書，也不是說每一個青年祗要看這兩部書，也並不是說我祇有這兩部書想推薦。大槪報紙副刊的編輯，想借此添一點新花樣，而塡寫者也大都是偶然覺得有什麽書不妨看看，就隨手寫下了。早知這一寫竟會闖出這樣大的文宇字糾紛來，卽使大晚報副刊編者崔萬秋先生給我蹟頭我也不肯寫的。今天看見「濤聲」第四十期上有一封曹聚仁先生給我的信，最後一句是：「没有比這兩部書更有利於青年了嗎？敢問。」這一問眞問得我啼笑皆非了。（曹聚仁先生的信態度很眞摯，我將有一封覆信給他，也許他會得刊在「壽聲」上，我希望你看一看。）</p>
<p>對於　之餘先生，我也不願再冒犯他，不過對於他在「　舊上」那一篇文章喪三點另外的話覺得還有一點意見！</p>
<p>（一）豐先生說：「有些新青年可以有舊思想，有些舊形式也可以藏新内容。」是的，新青年尚且可以有舊思想，那麽像我這種一遺少之羣中的一肢一節一之有舊思想似乎也可以存而不論的了。至於舊形式也可以藏新内容，則似乎寫「莊子」那樣的古文也不妨，祇要看牠的内容如何罷了。</p>
<p>（二）豐先生說不懂我勸青年看一莊子與文選」與做了考官以詞取士」有何分界，這其實是明明有着分界的。前者是以一己的竟見供獻給青年，接受不接受原在青年的自由；後者却是代表了整個階級（註：做官的階級也。）幾乎是强迫青年全體去塡詞了。（除非這青年不想做官）。　　（三）說魯迅先生的文章是從「莊子與文選」中來的，這確然是滑稽的，我記得我没有說過那樣的話。我的文章裏舉出魯迅先生來作例，其意祇想請不反　青年從古書中求得一點文學修養的魯迅先生來帮帮忙。魯迅先生雖然一向是勸青年多讀外國書的，但這是他以爲從外國書中可以訓練出思想新　的青年來；至於像我那樣給青年從做文章（或說文學修養）上着想，則魯迅先生就没有反對青年讀古書過。舉兩個證據來罷：（一）「少看中國書，其結果不過不能作文而已。」（見北新版　蓋集第四頁，）這可見魯迅先生也承認要能作文，該多看中國書了。而這所謂中國書，從上文看來，似乎並不是指的白話文書。（二）「我常被詢問，要弄文學，應該看什麽書？：：：我以爲倘要弄舊的呢，倒不如姑且靠着張之洞的「書目答問」去摸門徑去。」（見北新版而已集第四十五頁。）</p>
<p>現在，我想我應該在這裏「帶住」了，我曾有一封信給大晚報副刊的編者，爲了尊重豐之餘先生的好意，我曾請求允許我換兩部書介紹給青年。除了我還寫一封信給曹聚仁先生之外，對於這「莊子與文選」的問題我没有要說的話了。我曾經在「自同談」的壁上看過幾次的文字爭，覺得每次總是愈爭愈鬧意氣，而離本題愈遠，甚至到後來有些參加者的動機都是可以懷疑的，我不想使自己不由自主地被捲入漩渦，所以我不再說什麽話了。昨晚套了一個現成偈語：　此亦一是非　彼亦一是非</p>
<p>唯無是非觀　庶幾免是非</p>
<p>倘有人能寫篆字者乎？頗想一求法揮，張之素壁。　施蟄存上（十九日）</p>

<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>○○兄：</p>
<p>鹽的製造過程，在上兩封信裏，是已經說過，現在想接着寫下去的，是澉浦的鹽區，和鹽民們的一般生活情形。</p>
<p>這裡的鹽田一共分作東，西，南三區：東區長十里，西區二里，南區約一二里。鹽民的數，東區有七八千，西區有四五千，南區祇有幾百人。鹽灶的數，東區十八座，西區十座，南區三座。鹽的出產，據我調查，每年約一萬三千引，合一萬九千擔，每擔官價二元四角，值洋四十五萬六千元。每區設有灶董，東區一人，西南合一人。這灶董的產生，和國民會議時派代表差不多，是由官廳和鹽商共同磋商，圈派出來的，這種人的資格，大槪是有三種，一是和官廳與鹽商們向來有來往的，二是家計相當不壞的，三是智識比鹽民高的。這樣的灶董何如，我就不說，大約你是已經知道了。在名義上是鹽民的代表，實際上是不代表，而祇是聽命於官廳與鹽商前的人，帮他們來派捐派稅的人。據說有一個比較的好，相當的可以代表鹽民說話，但究竟代表什麽程度，我是不知道的。一切的鹽民的統率者，就是這樣的人物。所以，在這裡的鹽民，是常常餓得没有飯吃，而稅還加重，鹽董是不管的。</p>
<p>在澉浦的鹽民，實際上也不完全靠收鹽過活，他們也同時做其他的事，來輔助自己的生活。如東南二區的人，就兼種田。同時，東區鹽民，除收鹽種田外也種地，植樹，約有三百人左右兼營漁業。西區祇有少數的鹽民有山有田，靠近南北湖的，一部分兼捕魚。此外，鹽民們當然還有許多副業副產品，如養蠶等等，但主要的，還是柴蔴。不過，在澉浦有一個奇突的現家，必須說及的，就是無論鹽民，農民在夏秋是不種蔬菜的，買不到蔬菜，你眞的要吃，你得自己去採野草吃。因爲這時他們的田地都有别用，祇有在冬季，他們照常的種菜。鹽民在實際上，苦的很多，雖然無論在那一區，我們連一間草屋也看不到，而全是瓦屋。在鹽民中佔數量最多的爲肩挑小販，他們有時帮人做工，有時賣輕稅鹽，常常的餓肚。鹽民們不完全有鹽灶，或者有灶股，大抵他們所收得的滷，不是賣給朝奉一，卽所謂「灶董」，就是租灶董的灶自己來燒，可是這，究竟是很少數，大部分是賣潿。有的鹽民，在滷未收得之前，實際上是已經把錢從朝奉那裏用高利貸借來了，而以很多的滷去償還。朝奉所有的鹽池是很多的，把滷儲藏在裏面，等倉　的鹽賣完了，就用油桶打出再去燒，平時用泯筋封起來。如果你到澉浦來，你就可以看見，在灶區内，遍地都是滷桶，路旁邊有的是，路中間也有的是。你走的是路，路下面就是滷桶。眞可謂遍地是鹽。而且，在這旁邊，你有時還會看見，有長方形的鑲着約一二寸木邊的没有蓋的盒子盛着鹽滷，放在太陽光下，這呌做「晒鹽」，鹽有時是用「晒」的方法，而不用「燒」的方法。</p>
<p>關於鹽民的生活的總的方面，大致是如此，其餘的事，下次再談。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>哲安是從小就成了一個温柔，善良和性格的模範；而筆爾因爲不絶的聽到别人稱讚這大孩子，却漸漸的焦燥起來。在他看來，哲安的温柔卽是軟弱，善良卽是愚蠢，而好意卽是肓目。他的父母原是平和的人，祇希望兩個孩子將倈涌夠獲得一種有體面但却平庸的地位，責備他不應當見異思遷，···不應當興奮，責備他那些失敗的企圖，和一切好高騖遠，力不從心的志向。</p>
<p>當他成了大人以後，人家雖不再對他說：「你看看哲安，學學他罷！」但每次當他聽見别人反覆說着：「哲安做了這樣，做了那樣，」他懂得這些話裏的意思和那裏面包含的暗示。　　他們的母親是一個上流婦人，一個儉約的，感情頗爲敏銳的布爾喬亞，天生就一種温柔且細心的性格。她不斷地調解着兩個兒子每天由那種共同生活的最細微的事所發生的小小的敵意。並且這時還有一個輕微的事變使得她不狠案寗，她害怕事情要弄得麻煩起來，因爲去冬當她的兩個孩子正在結束他們的專門研究時，她認識了一個鄰居陸醉米太太，一個兩年前死在海上的遠洋航海船長的未亡人。這青年寡婦非常年青，還祇二十三歲，是一個本能地認識生活的聰明女人，好像一匹自由的獸一樣，好像她曾見過，經過，了解並衡量過一切事變一樣，她能以一種健全，仄狹，但含着好意的才智批判着。她習慣了每天晚上要跑到這兩位和善的鄰居家裏喝杯茶，閑談一會兒。</p>
<p>想作水手的那種奇癖不斷地昂奮起來的羅蘭老爺，常在他們那新交的女友面前打聽已死的船長的事情，而她便談着她的丈夫，她丈夫的游歷和那些陳舊的帙事等，她是那樣娓娓地談着，完全表現出一個愛生，敬死，有理性且能認耐的婦人。</p>
<p>兩個兒子回來後，發見這美麗的寡婦常來家中，便立刻動手對這女人獻媚起來，主要的動機不在使得這女人喜歡，而在戰勝自己的同胞。</p>
<p>謹愼而又注重實際的他們的母親，極希望兩人中有一個能夠征服這寡婦，爲的是這年青女人非常有錢。可是她又同樣希望另一個不至於有一點悲痛。</p>

<h3 id="c267">創造·模仿·享受 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>大家都曉得，人類是文化的產物。我們人類就因爲了文化，所以也就「異於禽獸」，所以也就未曾徵求動植礦諸物的同意，而自尊爲「萬物之聖」了。但，我們人類對於文化，一面賦有享受的權利，一面亦負有創造的義務。因爲要享受，就需去創造；有創造，然後才得享受。可是我們看一看，現在世界上能夠使用享受的權利，又得克盡創造的義務的，究有多少人？</p>
<p>不必是個西洋的崇拜者，你能否認近代很多文化部是西洋人發明的嗎？無論物質方面，或精神方面，隨便舉出幾樣來說，前者像電燈啦，火車啦，輪船啦，以及各種機器啦，後者如各種新思想，新學術，那一樣不是他們西洋人的貢獻？，平心而論，我們今日得享受這種優美的文化，直接閒接都是他們的恩賜。他們對於近代文化的功績，眞算是偉大了；雖則他們的努力，有種塲合，不免屬於錯誤；但這却是另外一個問題。</p>
<p>說到日本，他們誠然比不上西洋人有創造力；但他們的模仿本領，也着實可驚，有人新發明一種東西了，他們不能自己來發明，他們却能去模仿。他們不但要模仿到和你的一模一樣，還要製造得比你的更精緻巧妙。有時甚至還會因模仿而發現出一件新事物來，那才是利害。這是單就物質文化而言；若精神文化，則他們對於近代新思想新學術，且有不少的貢獻哩。</p>
<p>至於我們中國，創造旣不能，模仿也無從；我們就只會坐享其成吧了。我們是夠聰明了，我們不肯煞費工夫，徒勞心力去發明：也不屑不長進去傚擬别人的現成。我們有的是錢，今天有人創造了摩托，我們明天馬上就有汽車坐；明日有人發明了建築術，我們後天立刻就有洋房住。新學術新思想搬進來了，我們的鴻篇鉅著，也就隨着發表出去；我們的信仰主義，也就跟之起了動搖。舉凡一切近代文明，人家享受得到的我們也同模地享受得到；還有什麽缺陷？難道我們還不感到滿足，還想自己擾亂腦筋，煩勞手足，親自去學人創造模仿不成？</p>
<p>夠了！這裏所學，是三種不同的民族性。西洋人富有創造能力，所以他們的文化，便能一躍千里，日新月異，進步無窮；日本人富有模仿能力，所以他們也得和歐美並駕齊驅，生氣勃勃；獨我們中國人，只知享受，所以事事落後，日向死滅的路上跑。於此，我們足以明白，一種民族性，對於一個民族國家的文化關係，非常重大，實不容我們忽視。我並不是培歡說合家的好話，挖自己的苦處；因爲事實是明證，無庸隱諱。願國人早日覺醒，快把我們的民族性，從根本上好好地來改善一下吧！</p>
<h3 id="c268">窮人與戀愛 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>最近看了「滿江紅」。覺得窮人究竟能不能戀愛，的確成一個問題。</p>
<p>「滿江紅」裏告訴我們的是一窮人如果講戀愛，簡直是自尋死路」。然而「滿江紅」裏的窮人的戀愛是成功的，因爲雖然它的結尾的突然的大火，是窮人與女人同歸於燼。唯其大火來得「突然」，所以我們就視爲「牽强」，是勉强裝上去的「尾巴」。如果我們把這牽强的尾巴痛快地截去了，那便顯示出窮人戀愛成功的標凖。</p>
<p>然而，窮人究竟能講戀愛嗎？姑且不論現在社會情形的如何嚴重，農村經濟的如何破產，都市裏的失業人數如何的多；即使一個當歌女的肯降格埀青於一個窮小子，而大談其戀愛；但在窮人</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>這一方，斤斤於麫包尚虞其不足，何來這許多的閒情逸致。所以這一個離開事實的立論｜適見其「不通」而已。</p>
<p>不過，人無論窮富，不分男女，一達到了相當年齡時，便自然的内心起了一種迫切的要求，—　—也就是說，生理上發展到某一狀態時，就會感覺到一種莫名的「性」的飢渴。因之因發生「煩悶」。於是，要驅除這種「煩悶」，解决這種「飢渴」，滿足生理上的「迫切的要求」；而一方面要迎合潮流的趨勢，便「自然而然」的走了「戀愛」之途。</p>
<p>窮人的當前難題是「窮」，而「戀愛之途」又是建築在美麗的面龐和熌光的金錢上的，顯然的矛盾使窮人無問津之餘地，已　待失敗而後一廢然知返　。　　所以窮人祗有向前幹，暫時忘記「　　」雖然已達到需要戀愛的年齡。</p>
<p>况且戀愛的結果，也祇有作爲前進的動力的阻碍，增加經濟的負擔。與窮人絶對的不宜，而與前進的奮鬥的窮人更加不宜。雖然也有一般戀愛至上主義者在說：「戀愛可以助長人的做人的興趣，可以督促事業的進行　可以視作動力之一種。」誠然，不過須備具「不窮」的條件，須有「資產」作後盾，否則仍是烏托邦，夢想而已。</p>
<p>何况「戀愛」也者，根本就是「有產」及「有閒」者消閒的把戲，發揮他的「產」與「閒」的權威的工具，窮人如果要擠上這個舞台，簡直很有跌下來的可能，同時尚具有跌死的危險。</p>
<p>所以，我的結論是：窮人祇有向事業進攻，解决「窮」的問題。假使眞要登上「戀愛」的舞台時，待到「不窮」了尚還不遲。</p>
<p>因爲「窮人」與「戀愛」是根本絶緣的呀。</p>

<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>有一位招牌店裏的朋友，日前呌吾寫一塊招牌大字，這塊招牌，是某某醃</p>
<p>肉莊定做的，粗心的吾，一時忽略，將一個醃字，竟悮寫了鹹字，寫就之後，怱怱忙忙，並未審查，就給他拿去了，那招牌店裏的朋友，是目不識丁的，所以並未發覺，他就依樣畫葫蘆，將這塊招牌製成之後，送到醃肉莊上，高懸門首，以待該莊開幕之喜｜該莊老板，是個寗波人，他抬起頭來一看，竟大光其火，直跳起來，娘喜匹，婊子生，加相麽，這鹹肉莊招牌，是啥人寫的，就將招牌店老板，一把抓住，二人扭到了吾的寓所，大興問罪之師，這時吾已經知道，爲了一個「鹹」的錯誤，但是吾也不甘示弱，只能將錯就錯，隨機應變，他說吾開的是醃肉莊，你爲什麽寫鹹肉莊？不是觸我的霉頭嗎？吾對他說，你不要一味光火，事情要講實際，有言可說，有理可辯，醃肉的醃，和鹹肉的鹹，不是一而二，二而一嗎？况且飯館裏</p>
<p>吸人鹹肉豆腐湯，乾鹹肉，從未聽見過有醃肉腐湯，和乾醃肉之理。他道不是這樣說法的，鹹肉莊是開在八仙橋殺牛公司一帶的人肉市場阿！這是大家都知道的，你不是有意掉吾的　花，尋吾的開心嗎？吾說這是白相人的口頭禪，你在那一家肉林的門首，睢見過鹹肉莊的招牌，這個理由，毫無根據的，况且你的寳莊上，所售的是鹹魚，鹹蛋，鹹菜，鹹海蜇等東西，斷斷不能改爲醃魚，醃蛋，醃菜等名詞，這時他被吾駁得無言可說，他呆住了，他後來又說這塊招牌懸掛之後，竟哄動遠近，前來參觀的人，絡繹不絶，弄得吾很難爲情了，這是名譽有關的事情啊！吾說你不要弄錯；這個現象好極了，這是明明吾寫的招牌特别，也是一個很妙的宣傳作用，大凡新開舖子，能哄動遠近，前來參觀的人，又是絡繹不絶，却是生意興隆，財源茂盛的預兆啊！他聽到這二句好口彩，就笑逐顏開地去了，一場鹹的風波，方始平靜，果然，有意想不到之效力，前天吾偶然從該莊門前經過，只見斬鹹肉的人們，擁擠得不能立足，是不是爲了一個鹹字的宣傳，也無從調查了。</p>
<p>上海人稱第三等肉林市場爲鹹肉莊，不知是何取義，眞莫明其土地堂呢。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>偌大而繁華的上海，彷彿是全指着租界而言，上海是多麽地值得歌頌！租界更是多麽地值得崇讚！文人呀，多少在絞腦地寫着「南京路素描，」「霞飛路的夜！」美麗呀，快樂呀，一切的生色佳景，都祇在租界上傾瀉呵！</p>
<p>閘北麽，爲的還是一塊中國的土地，是那麽骯　，是那麽冷落！呵，這簡直是北極圈外的荒漠，綠洲中的沙基，掃興呀，剌眼呀，那裏配稱得上租界裏的一座毛厠？</p>
<p>且問誰個不有這麽一種觀感？誰個不心懷着這麽一種鄙棄？呵，閘北果眞是這樣麽？不是，絶對不是！假使我們不是滿中了某種的流毒，假使我們不曾架上染色的眼鏡，而且還具有一輻中華民性的骨髓，該會領味得澈這正是值得我們的崇讚之所在呵！</p>
<p>這兒的街衢雖然很骯髒，這兒的市面雖然很冷落，但，這不過好像一個拖着破舊的外衣的人一樣，也的身體，他的靈魂，却是崇高的純眞的，生氣勃勃的勇往向前的呵！</p>
<p>這兒没有媚外求榮的高等華人的淫影，也没有很毒的資本家的横行，也没有奸商巨賈的獰笑，也没有摩登仕士的性職業的活躍，也没有　　雅士的酣吟。有的是平民的活動，苦力的掙扎，他們爲着延續自己的生命，爲着家小的團聚，爲着人類的職司，爲着民族國家的前途，誰都擺脫了一　詞的　　，虚僞的身份，在用手，在用脚，猛力的向前進</p>

<p>— 澤卿</p>
<p>星期日晚上，因爲到大江南飯店去看朋友，但是約會的時候，還没有到。所以我便徘徊在北京路，儘是痴望着那紅的綠的指路燈，那兀然木立的印捕，那粉面紅唇的雉妓，那游蕩浮滑地公子哥兒。那猛獸樣的資本家的汽車，那蓬髮下尖削憔悴底乞丐的臉孔，那：：：。啊！多麽崎嶇罪惡的都市之夜！</p>
<p>「先生，到提監橋從那邊去？」</p>
<p>一個低微的呼聲，撩過我的聽覺。</p>
<p>同時，我的衣袖似乎有人在拖着。當我掉過頭去的時候，映入我眼簾是一個十三四歲撲素誠實的男孩子，穿了一身米白色的自由呢的學生裝。腋下挾着一個報紙的書包（？）一望而知是一個忠實的小學生。（？）</p>
<p>「提籃橋？遠呢！你跑到前面偷鷄　去乘七路電車去。一直到　　　　」。</p>
<p>「不！先生。我不坐電車去。我要走去，請　你走　修路？」</p>
<p>「走去？遠得很呢！那裏說得清？你認不得路。天又這樣晚，那能走去？你爲什麽要走到堤提籃橋去？」</p>
<p>「我家住在提籃橋。今天放了學。和姊妹到先施公司買東西。可是下了電車，人一擠。我尋不着姊妹了。我又認不得路，錢又放在姊姊身上，所以我想跑回去！」</p>
<p>「哦！我那裏能做得到。你這樣小的年紀。那裏能夠跑這樣多的路呢？旣然這樣，我給你這個銅子乘電車回去吧！」</p>
<p>「這怎樣可以？多　：：：」他天眞的羞怯低下頭。</p>
<p>「不要客氣。拿去吧！没有甚麽關係！」我便在錢袋裏給了他二十幾個銅子。並且指示他趕着去乘由北向駛來的七路電車。</p>
<p>我從大江南出來的時候，時計已經指着十一點了。然而這大都市裏過慣了夜生活的人們仍舊像白日裏一樣的嘲雜，喧囂，怱忙，熙攘：：：我拖着疲乏的身體，便向南京路那邊朝右轉彎。—　—目的是吃點心。</p>
<p>「先生！到提籃橋從那裏去？」</p>
<p>這樣一聲，撩過我的聽覺，我眞覺得奇怪。今天問提籃橋的爲什麽這樣多。當我轉過臉去的時候。我幾乎驚異得呌出來了。這不是北京路上我給錢他的那個孩子呢？他看見我的臉。也是格外驚慌失措。一溜烟從人叢中跑了。</p>

<p>掙扎兩字的意義，好似售有人類或任何動物，受了束縛的苦痛，作最後的努力；想達到自由或生存，試看家禽中的鷄或鴨；將要受人那宰殺時候，兩脚被繩子縛住；牠必定在那里掙扎着，呌着，希望能得到最後的生存或自由，看到這副神情，着實有些令人可憐，可是到底仍免不了人們的一刀，因爲牠們掙扎的能力；抵抗不過人們要殺牠們的力量，所以只好受人類的宰殺。</p>

<p>Changli: The bandit suppression plan involves Li's troops and the new Peace Preservation Corps exerting pressure from the southeast of 抚宁. Dou's troops are blocking bandits along the southwest of 抚宁, preventing them from fleeing southwest due to the large number of troops in the southeast. Dou's troops made contact with bandits on the right flank of Chiaofu Mountain on the evening of the 19th. Dou's troops are taking advantage of the momentum to advance, and the recovery of 抚宁 is expected. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Changli: Our newly formed Peace Preservation Corps, led by Chou Yu-ying, arrived at Changli at 2:00 AM on the 19th and departed eastward at 5:00 AM, disembarking at Peitaiho and advancing to their designated defensive positions. Li Chi-chun's troops arrived at Chin Island on the night of the 18th and advanced on the morning of the 19th, stopping at Sun Chia-pu. Dou Hsi-che's troops have also passed Ma Chia-yu and are advancing. Dou himself entered Chang Ko-chuang on the 19th to command everything. All routes are expected to reach their designated positions on the 20th, awaiting the general offensive. Chang Hsi-kuang, along with staff officers and translators, arrived in Changli on the morning of the 19th to meet Dou and then went to Chin Island, establishing a command post inside the Chin Public Security Bureau. When the Peining train No. 101 and the Kailuan explosive train passed Liushouying on the night of the 18th, the bandits mistook them for Peace Preservation Corps trains and opened fire. They were released after clarification. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Chou Yu-ying, the commander of the Second Peace Preservation Battalion, was ordered at 5:00 PM on the 18th to lead the First Company from Peitang to Lutai to meet with the Second and Third Companies. After being inspected by the Japanese garrison, they departed for Changli that night and arrived on the morning of the 19th. They will confer with Li Chi-chun's troops to advance and suppress the bandits. However, the bandits in eastern Luan have already fled upon hearing the news, and it is feared that they will be annihilated before suppression begins. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the suppression of bandits in eastern Luan, our newly formed Peace Preservation Corps arrived in Changli on the evening of the 18th. At the same time, a Japanese train passed through Changli eastward, posting notices of Sino-Japanese joint suppression along the way. It is rumored that the Japanese army will launch a pincer attack from western Luan eastward, including bombing. The various bandit gangs are extremely panicked knowing that the general offensive is imminent. Seven bandit leaders, including Lao Hao-tzu, Chang Kuei-yuan, Hu Yu-tien, Hu Yu-cheng, Huang Hai-huan, and others, have jointly written letters of repentance and sent representatives, including Yu Hui-min, to Peiping to seek an audience with Yu Hsueh-chung. The letters mainly stated that after the September 18th Incident, all units participated in the volunteer army and contributed to the war of resistance against Japan. Later, they were forced to retreat into the customs and had nowhere to go, so they became bandits. The attack on 抚宁 was indeed backed by someone and was a mishearing of instructions from a certain party. They now deeply regret their past mistakes and request permission to retain and resettle their units. The authorities have not yet considered this. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Peace Preservation Corps heading to eastern Luan has passed through Luan County, disembarked in Changli, and is heading to 抚宁 to suppress bandits. East of Changli, the Peace Preservation Corps Commander-in-Chief, Dou Hsi-che, is leading the cleanup of bandits in Liushouying and Peitaiho. Yu Hsueh-chung plans to formally organize the Peace Preservation Corps in eastern Luan to prevent hired bandits from roaming around the various passes of the Great Wall and is currently consulting with the Political Reorganization Committee. (19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) At 10:15 AM this morning, a through train from Shanhaikuan to Kaiping was traveling through Liushouying when dozens of gunshots were suddenly heard outside the train, shattering several windows and lights. Fortunately, no one was injured. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Japanese Embassy Counselor Harada met with Tao Shang-ming this afternoon to discuss the issue of bandit suppression in eastern Luan. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The bandit leaders of eastern Luan, Chang Kuei-yuan (aka Lao Hao-tzu), Hu Yu-tien, Hu Yu-cheng, Sung Tzu-wen, Ma Chin-ching, and Huang Hai-kuan, along with eight others, jointly appointed Yu Hui-min as their representative, carrying a letter signed by all the bandit leaders. On the morning of the 19th, they met with Yu Hsueh-chung at his private residence, requesting surrender. Yu strictly rejected them, stating that the nature of bandits is fickle.

<p>(Peiping) The disarmament of Fang Chi's remnants began on the 17th in areas such as Tien Ko-chuang, Tung Ko-chuang, and both sides of the Sha Yu River, and concluded on the afternoon of the 18th. Fang Chi's two units each had over 3,000 men. The confiscated weapons included 2,300 rifles, three mountain guns, seven or eight mortars, over ten light and heavy machine guns, and 6-700 horses. After the confiscation, Huang Shih-yueh, the chief of the Third Division of the Military Affairs Committee, distributed over 30,000 yuan in cash and steamed buns that he had brought. Most of the senior officers left. Starting in the afternoon of the 18th, the mid- and low-level officers and soldiers set out on foot. Fang's unit was escorted by troops dispatched by Shang Chen and passed through Taipingchuang today, heading to Chinghotown to board trains for training in Paoting. Chi's unit was escorted by troops dispatched by Kuan Lin-cheng. A train passed through Antingmen and transferred to the Peiping-Hankow Railway this morning, heading to Paoting. It is expected that the transportation will be completed tonight. Fang's division commander, Chang Fa-kuan, and chief of staff, Jen Kuang-wu, were issued passports by Kuan Lin-cheng last night and sent back to their hometowns. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Transportation Department of the Military Affairs Committee prepared five trains to transport Fang Chi's remnants to Sha Ho and Ching Ho stations for disbandment in Paoting. The first train transporting Fang Chi's troops arrived at Hsi Chih Men at 11:00 PM last night, carrying over 1,000 men from Chao Cheng-kai's unit. It stopped overnight and departed for Paoting this morning. Over 1,000 men from Mi Wen-ho's unit arrived at 3:30 PM this afternoon. After a short stop, they left for Paoting. Three more trains are expected to arrive in Peiping from Sha Ho tonight and tomorrow morning and transfer to Paoting, after which the transportation will be completed. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After leaving the army, Fang Chi took a car from Shunyi to Tientsin, but his whereabouts are unknown. Tang Yu-lin's unit, consisting of about 4-5,000 men with about 2,000 rifles, is currently active in the Erdaokou area. The national army is taking a surveillance attitude towards them. Liu Kuei-tang's unit is still stationed at its original defense in Chicheng and has not moved. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Miyun reports that the Japanese troops who had been dispatched from here to the Niulanshan area to intercept Fang Chi's remnants have now returned to Miyun on the 18th after the Fang Chi incident was resolved. They then boarded more than 30 cars and drove back to Chengteh. In the vicinity of Tang Ho-kou, dozens of miles northwest of Miyun, over a thousand bandits suddenly appeared, looting, burning, and killing everywhere. It is said that the male bandit leader is called Xiao Mingzi and the female bandit leader is called Lao Dao, both of whom are extremely vicious. They have declared their intention to attack the Tayu and Xiaoyu areas. The county government has now dispatched the defense regiment to provide strict defense. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Fang Chen-wu has been missing since he lost at Sun Ho-shu, and his whereabouts are still unknown. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Two Japanese Diplomats, Sugimura and Tokugawa, Arrive in Peiping for Lobbying, Will Visit Key Figures in Our Government, Tang Yu-jen Says There Are No Important Diplomatic Implications <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanking) After the League of Nations Commissioner Rajchman arrived in China, Yotaro Sugimura and Iemasa Tokugawa, Japanese diplomats with special missions to China, arrived belatedly. The stated purpose of the two gentlemen's visit is to inspect the overseas Chinese in Central and South China. However, external speculation believes that the so-called Hirota diplomacy policy has begun to be active. Minister Arima hastily went north from Peiping. Sugimura and Tokugawa arrived in Peiping on the night train on the 19th, stating that they would visit various authorities in our country to express their goodwill. According to a certain gentleman in diplomatic circles, there are many speculations about the two gentlemen's visit to China. The government does not attach importance to it. There is absolutely no reason for the Sino-Japanese issue to deviate from the established principles. Their visit to Peiping is of a private nature and is a private response to their visit as a matter of courtesy. Moreover, their inspection of various places is for their own country's overseas Chinese affairs, which has nothing to do with us. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanking) Tang Yu-jen said that Sugimura is the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to Belgium and Tokugawa is the minister to Canada. Because they have heard of many famous Chinese scenic spots, the two gentlemen took advantage of their trip to take office to travel in China and did not bear important missions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Moreover, since the two gentlemen are not diplomatic envoys stationed in China, our government will not talk about Sino-Japanese issues except to treat them with international etiquette. If they come to Peiping, it will only be a visit, and no diplomatic events can be discussed. As for the so-called Japanese side believing that the German withdrawal from the international situation is drastically changing, and the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee is convening a meeting, and important figures in North China are gathered in Peiping, and believe that the opportunity for negotiation has arrived, so the Japanese side has Minister Arima and Representative Okamura, who is stationed in Manchuria with full authority, to start negotiations with our North China authorities to determine the national border and cancel the truce agreement and other issues, which is even more absurd. Our country's foreign policy has always been entirely determined by the Central Government. The Central Government has not discussed the North China issue this time. The North China authorities should not negotiate with Japan on their own. All kinds of rumors are completely inaccurate propaganda from a certain side. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Japanese Envoy Arima left Peiping for the north yesterday with Counselor Arino. It is expected that he will arrive in Peiping tonight. Huang sent Tao Shang-ming as a representative to welcome him. Arima plans to stay in Peiping for a month. It is said that Arima will be transferred back to Japan and his vacancy will be filled by Sugimura, who came to China for inspection a few days ago. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Arima said that the war zone issue is related to "Manchukuo" and is mostly the responsibility of the Kwantung Army. My visit is for inspection and I am not responsible for negotiation. I will return to Peiping in a month. The visit to He and Huang is not scheduled. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Japanese Envoy Arima passed through Tientsin at 5:00 PM on the 19th to go to Peiping. The Japanese consul and other officials welcomed him at the station.

<h3 id="e6">Our Government Cancels the Wireless Contract, Japan Will Demand 5 Million for Construction <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the cancellation of the Shuangqiao Radio Station contract with Mitsui &amp; Co. and the American Federal Radio contract by the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received an official announcement. If this is the case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will raise a serious protest to the National Government for the following reasons: (1) The Ministry of the Navy of the Peking Government and Mitsui &amp; Co. signed a contract in 1918 to build a radio station in Peking. The contract signed between the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the United States in 1921 only stipulated the right to broadcast to the United States, and it was planned to build a radio station in Shanghai, but construction has not yet started. The dispute over the exclusive broadcasting rights of China, Japan, and the United States continues to this day. (2) The National Government's unilateral cancellation of this contract is, of course, not recognized by Japan in law, and its cancellation is completely invalid. (3) If the Chinese side implements the cancellation of the contract, Japan will demand China to compensate for the 5 million yuan loan for radio construction between the Peking Government and Mitsui &amp; Co.

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Puppet Troops Plan to Occupy Ma Lan Yu for a Long Time, Building a Motor Road Between Xinglong and Ma Lan Yu, Rifles of the Xinglong Militia Confiscated Door to Door <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) A regiment of Japanese troops and a battalion of puppet troops arrived in Ma Lan Yu town, Xinglong County. After driving away our county magistrate, they set up all kinds of defensive works and issued a notice saying that they were protecting the Qing Dynasty mausoleums. Our county magistrate, Li Ying-lian, retreated to Zunhua and reported to the provincial government by telephone, awaiting negotiations. The next morning, several representatives from the Japanese and puppet troops came to Zunhua City, asking him to return to his post to maintain order, and stated that they came purely to protect the Qing mausoleums and had no other intentions. Li returned to his post after explaining. However, the Japanese side requested that the land rights be governed by Manchukuo, but the national donations and taxes would be collected by our side. Our side has refused. Now the Japanese army is building a motor road from Ma Lan Yu to Xinglong County, which has reached Ba Baling, only twenty or thirty miles away from Xinglong County. It will be open to traffic in a few days. Recently, some Japanese rogues have come one after another, scattered in Zunhua and Xinglong counties, engaging in the business of morphine, heroin, and opium, which is quite developed. In order to avoid interference from our government officials, they rent insurance licenses for five yuan each day and night. Those who rent them hang them in front of their doors, and the government officials do not dare to interfere. The Xinglong militia organization was originally very complete and the weapons were also complete. The Japanese army was quite jealous of them. Recently, they suddenly confiscated the number of weapons according to the militia organization roster, and they were afraid that they would be secretly hidden and not handed over. They searched door to door, turning boxes and cabinets upside down, causing great disturbance to the residents. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Currency Inflation and Military Expansion - Reality <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>When countries around the world implemented the gold standard, although the amount of pure gold differed, the goal of stabilizing the price scale and the widespread circulation of gold coins was the same. Therefore, it can be said that the gold standard has international circulation and that the free trade of capitalism is based on the gold standard. Britain, as a pioneer of free trade, abandoned its gold standard in the autumn of 1931. Although it did not directly adopt a currency inflation policy, it used the low exchange value of its currency to raise prices domestically in order to boost industry and encourage exports overseas in order to restore the economy. As a result, it was able to alleviate the urgent situation at that time and maintain its maritime hegemony. Japan, seeing Britain take the lead, also quickly rose up in the winter of the same year, announcing a ban on cash exports, changing from the previous austerity policy to lowering the international exchange value of its currency in order to increase exports. Britain's textile industry had a huge force and its exports of textile goods were proud. However, the Far East market was eventually seized by the emerging Japan. In addition, Japan's labor was cheap and the cost of goods was low, and its competitiveness in the market gradually increased. Not only did the economic power of Japan spread east of Hong Kong, but even from India to Africa, which was originally dominated by British economic power, Japanese goods have also invaded, which is difficult to prevent. This is because the Japanese yen is lower than the British pound.</p>
<p>The United States was affected by the devaluation of the pound, and exports to Europe gradually decreased. The relationship with South America also deteriorated, and the promising market in the Far East was filled with cheap Japanese goods. Under such circumstances, even if it wanted to reluctantly support its gold standard and maintain the status quo with an "anti-contraction" policy, it could not be achieved. Therefore, after Roosevelt came to power, he had to decisively abandon the fortress of the gold standard in order to solve the current crisis and restore the declining market. Although the effect is not yet known, it is inevitable.</p>
<p>At this moment, major European countries such as France and Germany intend to defend the gold standard to the death and strive to prevent the attack of the currency inflation frenzy. Therefore, the actions of Britain, the United States, and Japan to depreciate the currency have the effect of increasing exports and raising prices internationally. If all countries in the world abandon the gold standard and unanimously lower the parity of currencies, then the general income of wages and prices will rise equally, and the low purchasing power will still be the same as it is now, and the stagnation of the economic future will still be the same. However, after currency inflation is realized, free trade will also disappear with it. The so-called controlled currency inflation policy is essentially economic nationalism. In other words, it is a variant of wartime controlled economy.</p>
<p>Since the economy is based on national self-sufficiency, the expression of national omnipotent politics and the re-establishment of national boundaries within a country cannot but suddenly increase greatly. The promotion of economic struggle is reflected in politics and becomes more serious. Therefore, the theory of international cooperation has become empty talk on paper and a social activity on the diplomatic front. Countries are now focusing their efforts on the development of military power, the development of the domestic market, and the maintenance of overseas markets. Although the things are different, they are actually the same.</p>
<p>Today's intense military competition is the naval competition between Japan and the United States in the Pacific, and the so-called security guarantee and the dispute over equality of armaments between France and Germany in Europe. Germany is currently trapped in economic drought and it is difficult to actually increase its military strength. After withdrawing from the alliance, the situation is very serious. However, Japan has won a great profit due to war speculation. In the past three years, military expenditures have been increasing year by year. This year's military expenditure is almost double that of 1931. The budget for next year will probably increase by one-third compared to this year. The actual number will be more than 1.3 billion Japanese yen. This is why the world is shocked and countries are fearful. The United States has strongly advocated building up its fleet to make up for the London Treaty in order to compete with the Japanese navy. Britain is not willing to fall behind. Therefore, the dispute over naval fleet construction is as fierce as the dispute over currency inflation. The entire world has transformed from economic panic to the outbreak of a political crisis.</p>

<p>(Washington) US President Roosevelt is determined to recognize Soviet Russia in order to break through the domestic economic difficulties. The documents related to the US recognition of Russia were submitted to the State Department yesterday. It is reported that the US recognition of Russia is subject to two conditions: (1) Russia must recognize the public and private properties and debts confiscated by the Russian side during the Russian Revolution; (2) Russia guarantees to the US that it will never promote communism within US territory. (Hua Lian News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government is now seriously considering the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia. Most newspapers advocate unconditional recognition. Senator Borah, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said that if the US restores friendly relations with Soviet Russia, the US will have a more advantageous position over other countries in the Pacific, especially Japan, and the opportunity for successful disarmament will be greater. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US President Roosevelt submitted the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with Russia to the cabinet. It is also reported that US and Russian representatives have already engaged in informal discussions. Whether these discussions are being held by Mummery in Latvia with the Russian ambassador is still unknown. However, according to reliable sources, the two have discussed in Latvia issues related to the property of US citizens confiscated during the early stages of the revolution. The US insists that before restoring diplomatic relations, the Russian government must acknowledge its debts for the confiscated property and outstanding bonds. According to unverified news, the Soviet Russian representative has suggested giving satisfactory recognition, but has not guaranteed full repayment within a definite time limit. In addition, Soviet Russia has also agreed to guarantee not to promote communism in the US. It is now believed that the US government's decision on the issue of restoring diplomatic relations will be announced around November 1st, and then wait for the Senate to approve it after it convenes in January next year. According to the US Constitution, this matter only requires separate approval by the Senate, and the debate is not public. As for the commercial talks between Jones, the general director of the US Financial Reconstruction Corporation, and Skvirsky, the unofficial representative of Soviet Russia in Washington, and Bogdanov, the general manager of the Amtorg Trading Corporation, are held frequently. What is being discussed is the method of lending to Soviet Russia to purchase US goods. So far, none of the Russian representatives have directly met with anyone in the State Department, but it is expected that this will happen soon. All commercial talks are reported by Jones to the White House and stored in the President's personal document file. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, accompanied by Counselor Ding, visited Army Minister Araki at his official residence at 11:00 AM this morning. It is rumored that Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei intend to take advantage of Song Ziwen's return to China to combine China with Britain and the United States and urgently prepare for a long-term resistance against Japan. The so-called pro-Japanese shift in direction is a false cover. In reality, this is extremely difficult to implement and is all baseless rumors. Moreover, on the premise of being entrusted by Chiang and Wang, he stated his belief in opening up the obstacles to Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Later, Army Minister Araki said that the current state of Sino-Japanese relations is not only unfortunate for both China and Japan, but also the root cause of unrest in the Far East. Therefore, at this moment, we should give up the small and pursue the big, and hope to strive for Far Eastern peace. The meeting ended at 11:40 AM. (Dentsu News Agency, 19th)</p>

The method of confiscation is to first order those who possess military weapons to hand over their weapons. Based on the quality of the weapons, they are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grades A, B, and C will be purchased at corresponding prices. Grade D, which is unusable, will be confiscated.

<p>(Washington) Colonel House, an important figure in the US Democratic Party, suddenly arrived at the State Department today and had lengthy meetings with Secretary of State Hull, Deputy Secretary of State Phillips, etc., which has aroused speculation. Although House occupies an important position in the Democratic Party, he has always been reluctant to speak out. The content of his sudden visit to the State Department and his talks with Hull and others remain silent. However, it is known that this trip to the capital is definitely not aimless. Therefore, it is rumored that House was summoned to the capital to discuss the political situation caused by Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations. From other sources, it is learned that House is well-versed in the situation in Germany. A month ago, he knew that if the major powers could not agree on a disarmament plan and only make a promise not to increase armaments, Germany would no longer participate in the Disarmament Conference. Therefore, many people expect that today's talks will be related to whether the US can suggest reconsidering the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles and the obligations imposed on Germany. It is said that if this procedure is followed through ordinary diplomatic channels, it will be extremely difficult because the US has not signed the treaty. Therefore, it is believed that House may be able to use his wonderful method to convey the intentions of the US government to European diplomats. Because if the US takes this action, it will not necessarily propose it, but will only express the US's sympathy for those in the old allies who suggest reconsidering the treaty. It is heard that the US agrees with Britain's position and advocates ultimately granting the Germans equality in armaments, but is unwilling to implement equality unless Germany provides some kind of guarantee. However, at this time, whether other concessions can be made in the Treaty of Versailles in exchange for Germany temporarily waiting some time before implementing equality in armaments is said to have been studied by the US government.</p>
<p>House has always been deeply trusted by many important figures in Germany. It is said that several German figures informed House in September that if other countries were unwilling to reduce their own armaments, the Disarmament Conference would fail, and Germany would feel that it should no longer respect the armament restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. At present, the US government is deeply concerned about Germany's implementation of this statement, so it intends to come forward and mediate. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>

<p>Simon Receives Unanimous Support from Cabinet Members</p>
<p>(London) The British Cabinet met today to discuss disarmament matters. All cabinet members attended for two hours. Reuters learned that there was no resolution on British armament policy because talks with other countries have not been completed. The Cabinet first listened to Foreign Secretary Simon's explanation of the circumstances leading to Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference, and then discussed the policies and directions to be taken when the conference reopens next week. It is generally believed that one point that was discussed was German Foreign Minister Neurath's accusation that Simon had not accurately explained Germany's position to the US, and Neurath's denial that Germany's disarmament demands had recently increased. It is heard that the Cabinet considered issuing a statement to prove that Simon's statement was very accurate. After the meeting, Simon was summoned by the British King to Sandringham to report on all developments regarding the Disarmament Conference. The British King has always been very concerned about discussions on disarmament issues. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Simon is about to resign. People here are pleased to hear this. Since several days ago, the newspapers have been working hard to make people believe that Simon is isolated in the British Cabinet. His declarations in Geneva,</p>
<p>The correspondent stationed in London sent a message stating that it was officially denied there that Simon intended to resign, and said that this statement was not compatible with the current political situation. Moreover, in the current international situation, the members of the British National Cabinet are more likely to cooperate closely. Therefore, Simon can get the support of his colleagues and his position is extremely strong. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of War Lord Hailsham gave a speech in Liverpool, vehemently opposing Germany's strategy of alienating British cabinet members, saying, "Under these circumstances, I must declare that the speech delivered by Foreign Secretary Simon in Geneva (at the meeting of the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference) last Saturday and Sunday was not in a personal capacity, but in the capacity of a representative of the British Cabinet, in response to the current situation, and all cabinet members supported it."

<p>Rome: Responsible parties formally denied the claim that the Italian government had convened or was about to convene a conference of the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact to discuss the issue of disarmament, saying that in the current situation, they can only adopt a wait-and-see attitude. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to a report from Rome in the Vossische Zeitung, Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to convene a conference of the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact seem to have suffered a setback. Italy, encountering the resolute attitude of Britain and France, seems determined to apply greater pressure. The Italian Daily asks what demands Germany must meet in order to continue participating in disarmament talks. German people find this question strange. The Vossische Zeitung said that the newspaper's question was unwise because the German government's decision last Saturday and Sunday was preceded by negotiations. During the negotiations, its demands were clearly expressed, and Premier Hitler reiterated them in his speech last night. (National News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome: "Il Popolo d'Italia" published a commentary to explain Italy's attitude towards the European situation, saying, "After Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, many foreign newspapers said that Italy would act as a mediator. To put it bluntly, such actions are indeed unpredictable. The Fascist government's surprise at Germany's decision to withdraw from Geneva is the same as that of other countries. Unless there is a suitable situation, Italy has no reason to initiate mediation. Because in the current situation, there is absolutely no hope for such actions to proceed smoothly." The newspaper also said that before the results of the German general election are clear, it is not appropriate to take any measures. In addition, the "Stampa" also said that a period of observation is needed at present, and that although the peak of the crisis has passed, unfounded optimism is also inappropriate.

<p>(London) "Daily Mail" correspondent Bess visited Premier Hitler in Berlin and asked his opinion on various issues, especially on the foreign opinion that Germany is fickle and aims at war. Hitler replied that he was deeply saddened that the British people could not understand Germany and hoped that the two countries would restore their old friendship. Regarding the goal of war, Hitler reaffirmed that no one in Germany was happy to fight. "Because the German people and the leaders of the National Socialist Party are all veterans of the war, they have personally experienced the suffering of the four-year war, so no one wants to see the disaster of war again." Hitler also said that Germany is strengthening its internal strength only to deal with internal enemies, especially the Communist Party. "The power of the Communist Party in Germany is beyond what the British can imagine." Speaking of German-French relations, Hitler said that Germany is willing to have a good understanding with its neighbor, but it should be "based on what a self-respecting country can accept." The "Daily Mail" reporter then asked about the rumor that Germany was secretly manufacturing arms. Hitler shrugged his shoulders and replied that this statement was close to "childish." If foreign countries had factories managed by Germany, the world would be able to know exactly the details of the armaments manufactured by these factories, because "if Germany really had secret armaments stored in foreign countries, even if it was only what a regiment needed, how wide would the area it occupied be? All soldiers who have participated in the war can say that it is impossible to hide it. Therefore, the existence of German armaments in foreign countries is an inconceivable talk." Hitler also said that if it were true, how would Germany transport this kind of armament stored abroad back to Germany once the war broke out? His conclusion was that Germany only had some field guns, and the number was ridiculously small. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>

This move will tacitly cancel the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles that prohibit Germany from possessing military aircraft.

<p>Istanbul: As a result of Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös' arrival here at the invitation of the Turkish government, the Treaty of Good Friendship, Neutrality and Non-Aggression between Turkey and Hungary will certainly be extended. A similar treaty between Turkey and Greece was signed on October 17th. Therefore, the political and economic unity of Central and Eastern European countries has been further enhanced. Yesterday, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš had lengthy talks with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in Vienna and decided to sign a supplementary commercial treaty with Austria, with special emphasis on Austria's wishes. At the same time, the Little Entente countries are now trying their best to befriend Bulgaria. When Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu traveled from Bucharest to Istanbul at the end of the week, he hinted that the monarchs of Romania and Bulgaria could be expected to meet soon. Approximately after the meeting, they will also meet with the King of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić declared that he will travel to Bucharest soon to seek an understanding to consolidate Balkan peace. According to observers, the reason why small countries are eagerly seeking ties is that the power of the German Nazi Party is daunting.

<p>Vienna: Czech Foreign Minister Beneš arrived here this morning. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss personally welcomed him at the station. After Beneš got off the train, he went to the Czech embassy with Dollfuss. The talks between Beneš and Dollfuss began at 11:15 AM and lasted for several hours. Later, Beneš entered the audience of Austrian President Miklas. At 5:10 PM, Beneš left Vienna and returned directly to Prague. Afterwards, the government did not issue a statement, but according to relevant sources, the talks between Beneš and Dollfuss were about all political and economic issues between the two countries and the countries in the Danube River region. Beneš seemed to have slightly changed his expression towards Austrian policy in the future. It is said that Beneš has always opposed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's Danube policy, but during his talks with Dollfuss this time, he indicated that he might make slight concessions in the future, because the current ill-will between Germany and Austria has made Austria's understanding of Czech policy extremely easy to succeed. Furthermore, Prague's public opinion also indicated that after Beneš's visit to Austria, a new policy towards Austria may appear, giving Dollfuss a new alliance and strengthening the strength to protect Austria's independence. However, Vienna newspapers did not mention this political plan, saying that in economic terms, there will be new cooperation plans with the Czech Republic and the Danube countries in the future.

Since the Great War, the consumption of naval fuel has decreased by one-third, while torpedo boats and submarines have made great progress.

<p>(London) Today, the London News Chronicle published an article by former British Prime Minister Lloyd George, titled "Broken Promises," discussing the current crisis of the League of Nations in detail. It states that if the League fails to accomplish its primary task, namely the reduction of armaments, and the ship is thereby wrecked, the sole reason will be the incompetence of the sailors on board, causing the ship to drift aimlessly and be battered by large waves against dangerous reefs. Lloyd George further stated that although the situation is extremely perilous, it is not entirely hopeless. However, it depends on whether those on board have the ability to seize the moment and refloat the grounded vessel. He argues that for years, the League's conferences have focused only on discussing trivial matters, and that Germany sees no other option but to withdraw from the League, as it must maintain its self-respect while all other countries, large and small, are fully armed, and it itself lacks even the means of self-defense.

<p>(Washington) Based on various indications, the authorities seem to have a more urgent approach to the recovery movement than before. It is likely that in addition to wages, prices, and production, capital will also be subject to government control. People in business circles believe this is uncertain, and the authorities have new restrictions on issuing new bonds, making it difficult to use capital. The authorities have responded to this criticism by issuing a statement saying that they will no longer allow the free use of money. As a result, it is believed that banks, securities, and commodity exchanges will all be subject to strict control. At the same time, according to figures obtained at the statisticians' conference, the increase in distribution of manufactured goods in September was less than the total amount of seasonal sales, about 11% less than in 1932. The authorities are now actively pursuing a campaign to buy promptly, in order to expand sales. The Edison Company in New Jersey is giving each employee an additional five dollars on top of their weekly wages, urging them to spend it immediately to stimulate trade. It is generally believed that the recent slowdown in business is a reaction to the artificial boom of early summer. However, the number of unemployed has indeed decreased. Labor Secretary Frances Perkins stated that 620,000 people regained employment in September. Since March of this year, the number of unemployed has decreased by 2.7 million, and weekly wages have increased by $64 million. President Roosevelt is now refusing to allow the import of medicinal alcohol, and has rejected proposals to allow it to be imported and stored for release around December 21st, when Prohibition is lifted.

They do not want to use greenbacks or treasury bills to raise prices. These plans are being studied in detail so that they can be presented to the President. According to official sources, the government originally intended to announce its monetary policy this week, but this has been delayed due to the sudden drop in farm product prices. It is now expected that no announcement will be made until the prices recover to a level deemed satisfactory by the government. However, there is currently no danger of currency inflation. Steps to stabilize the gold dollar and gold pound have already begun, but are not being rushed. Some advisors admit that a return to a revised gold standard may not be possible before next spring, and the timing of its return will depend on the overall state of industry and commerce.

<p>(Tokyo) Official telegrams regarding the negotiations at the Simla Conference on the 17th arrived at the Foreign Ministry yesterday. The Indian representatives made the following proposals to Japan: (1) The allocated quantity of Japanese cotton cloth imports should be 320 million square yards. (2) Japan's purchase quantity of Indian cotton should be 130,000 bales. (3) India will reduce the cotton cloth tariff to 52.5%. (4) The increase or decrease in the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth imports and the quantity of Indian cotton purchased should be linked to each other, adopting the so-called Sliding Scale system. (5) Reduce tariffs based on the above quantities. (6) Aside from preferential treatment for the British Empire, no discriminatory treatment should be applied to other foreign countries. Japan should be granted most-favored-nation status. Representative Sawada refuted these proposals, saying that India's proposals were far removed from Japan's proposals, especially the linking of Japanese cotton cloth import quantities and Indian cotton purchase quantities, which Japan absolutely opposed. He requested that Japan's proposals be used as the basis for a compromise proposal. Governor Bowyer also rose to refute this. The meeting ended at this point. (19th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>Simla: As a result of the Japanese-Indian government meeting on the 17th, there was still a considerable gap between the proposals of the two sides. It was expected that the meeting between Representative Sawada and Governor Bowyer would find a solution. Yesterday morning, Representative Sawada, accompanied by Officer Matsushima, visited Governor Bowyer at his private residence and held the first private meeting, lasting for one hour. He left at noon. From this meeting, it can be seen that India is still taking a considerably tough stance. The atmosphere of considering the future relations between Japan and India and seeking a political solution suddenly became strong. In addition, the Japanese side, through this meeting, has learned of India's attitude and is coordinating countermeasures and telegraphing the home ministry for instructions. Therefore, the government representatives' meeting scheduled for the 19th has been temporarily suspended. (19th Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) The so-called "Chinese Soviet Republic" composed of southern Jiangxi and northern Fujian used to export tobacco, sugarcane, and indigo before the government forces implemented a blockade. The inland areas were mostly self-sufficient in grain, but did not produce salt. Its capital is Ruijin, where the Central Committee appointed by the "Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" is stationed. Mao Zedong is also in Ruijin. The National Government has now offered a reward of 100,000 yuan for his head. Mao is a young man of 32, suffering from lung disease, and it is feared that he will not live long. Mao has established a Workers' and Peasants' Bank in Ruijin and issued 20 million yuan in paper money. Its branches are located in Zhu De's headquarters to facilitate the army's exchange for daily necessities. The mint issues new 20-cent silver coins every year.</p>
<p>The silver coins are minted with an image of Marx on one side and a Communist Party symbol of a sickle and axe on the other. Ruijin now has a Lenin Normal School and a People's School, as well as a political and military school. Its organization is similar to that established by Borodin in Guangzhou. There is now a hospital and two treatment centers. It was originally planned to build a number of public hospitals, but this could not be realized due to the lack of medicine and other supplies after the National Army implemented a blockade. The bandits now organize their own post offices and issue five-cent stamps, which are engraved with the Communist sickle symbol. They also publish a newspaper called "Central Red Light News." The old county boundaries are still retained, but each village and county has an organization of the Soviet and Executive Committee, exercising powers under the supervision of the Communist Party representatives. The registration of the people is divided into several age groups: 10 to 15, 15 to 20, 20 to 40, and 40 to 60. The people must obey the orders of the Party, and everyone is forced to undertake some kind of work. All land deeds of the people have been destroyed, and the land has been re-allocated. The method is that 30% belongs to the Farmers' Association, 30% to the state, and 40% to the landlords. Each household is limited to 20 mu of land. However, the Farmers' Association has already failed, because most of the land of the association has been leased to individuals for cultivation. As for the land belonging to the government, it is all wasteland and mountain areas. The products obtained by the farmers can only be sold by cooperative shops on behalf of the farmers at extremely low prices. They can only retain the rice and grain to supply themselves, so the farmers mostly feel the inequality of this treatment, but under the red terror, there is nothing they can do. The property in the cities has also been treated in the same way, divided into various areas and evenly distributed to each household for living. The operation of various shops is based on the Soviet cooperative theory, with no distinction between shop owners and shop assistants. Shop owners also only serve in the shop as employees, because all the shops have also been confiscated by the state, and the prices of various items are also managed by the state, so there is no profit to be made. Each person is only allowed to deposit 50 yuan in cash. The practice of the eldest son inheriting property, which has been practiced in China for thousands of years, is absolutely prohibited. There is no talk of filial piety to parents. All children over the age of ten are forced to enter the "Workers' and Peasants' Military School" to receive training, learn to sing the Internationale, and carry out propaganda work. They also form children's corps and often send them to the front line to confront the National Army. These children must leave their hometowns to receive training, and in order to cultivate the cruelty of young children, those who violate party rules in the Red Army are ordered to be executed by these children. Those aged 15 to 20 are incorporated into the "Red Guards," and then incorporated into the regular army. These troops are guided by youths from Moscow or the Belorussian Lenin University. In 1931, there were about 200 such young military officers who infiltrated Jiangxi Province. There are now no Russian advisors, because the Red Army thinks it is not needed. The finances of the Communist bandits, even if supplied by Moscow, are not enough, so they use the confiscated cash to issue paper money. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Inner Mongolian Princes and Nobles Hold Meeting at Bailing Temple; Prince De Exploited and Inciting Autonomy; Princes and Nobles Extremely Dissatisfied with Prince De; Songshishi Takayoshi Incites Riots in Duolun <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Inner Mongolia is divided into three parts: Eastern Mongolia, Central Mongolia, and Western Mongolia. Zhaowuda League within Rehe Province is Eastern Mongolia. Five Banners and ten Flags of Xilingol League within Chahar Province, and four Left Wing Banners of Chahar are Central Mongolia. Four Banners and six Flags of Ulanqab League in Suiyuan, seven Flags of Yikezhao League, two Left and Right Wing Flags of Shumeite Tribe, and four Right Wing Flags of Chahar Tribe are Western Mongolia. Since the loss of Rehe, Eastern Mongolia's connection has already been severed. Central and Western Mongolia still maintain their original relations. Recently, Prince De, the Deputy Leader of Xilingol League in Central Mongolia, has been exploited and is advocating autonomy, which has become a problem and is attracting attention from all sides.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the Mongolian people is unsophisticated. During the feudal era, the income from herding livestock throughout the year was entirely used to support the princes and nobles. In recent years, more and more young Mongolians have resided in the interior, and those with higher levels of knowledge have felt the desire to break away from the shackles of the prince system and obtain true freedom. The autonomy movement is gradually emerging. Prince De, although having less seniority among the general princes, is relatively cunning. Recently, he has been exploited by a certain party, thinking of seizing power. On one hand, he is trying to win over the Panchen Lama to use as a means of rallying support. On the other hand, he is chanting loudly for autonomy to win over the public's favor. However, most princes and nobles are fully aware of the situation and are not fooled. And the more knowledgeable Mongolian people also believe that the proposed autonomy regulations are contrary to what the Mongolian people hope for, adding another layer of shackles to the Mongolian people. They are cursing and reviling each other. Therefore, Prince De convened a meeting for the first time at Bailing Temple to discuss the topic of autonomy, but very few people attended, and there were no results. He then changed the date to convene another meeting on the 28th of last month. When the time came, the meeting could not be held again due to too few people. It was not until the 9th of this month that the assembly was held, but there were still no results. On the 13th, another meeting was held, attended by six princes and more than fifty Beizi and Beile. Most of the princes, Beizi and Beile attended the meeting to pay homage to the Panchen Lama, and very few were truly called by Prince De. Before the meeting, Prince De drafted autonomy regulations and proposed organizing an autonomous organization at an appropriate location. Prince Zhuo, Prince Suo, Prince Yang, and others opposed Prince De's actions, which had a strong background. The other princes and Beile remained silent. Seeing that the atmosphere at the meeting was not good, Prince De said that anyone who did not speak would be considered to have tacitly agreed. However, no one spoke. The meeting lasted for several hours and again produced no results. However, after the meeting, Prince De even issued a declaration in the name of the leader, stating that the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia would organize an autonomous government and implement a high degree of autonomy. His ambitions have not ended, and he is thinking of actively proceeding. According to observations from all sides, most Inner Mongolian princes and the general public, except for Prince De, strongly support the central government and are quite dissatisfied with Prince De being instigated. However, under the current complex situation, if the central government cannot take appropriate measures, the temptation of external forces and the incitement from within can also be sufficient to initiate changes. Songshishi Takayoshi, the director of the Kwantung Army's special mission in Rehe, went to Duolun before Prince De convened the meeting and invited the Inner Mongolian princes to talk, with sinister incitement. He has not yet left Duolun, and his intentions are frightening. (October 17)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Panchen Lama Discusses Reasons for Inner Mongolian Autonomy; Yan Xishan Sends Shi Huayan to Meet with the Panchen Lama; Panchen Lama Hopes Central Government Officials Will Go to Mongolia Soon <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Suiyuan Correspondence: Shi Huayan, the Director of Suiyuan Reclamation, was dispatched by telegram by Yan Xishan and accompanied by Ding Wangduoji, the Director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Suiyuan, to pay homage to the Panchen Lama at Siziwang Banner by car. Shi and others have now returned to Suiyuan yesterday (the 13th). According to their account, the details of the trip and the situation of Inner Mongolian autonomy are roughly as follows: Shi said that Yan Director (Xishan) and Fu Chairman (Zuoyi) sent him (Shi's self-reference) to inquire about the Panchen Lama's well-being because the Panchen Lama had been proclaiming in the western frontier for many years without resting. They recently heard that the master had returned to Siziwang Mansion from Xilin Gol League. On the morning of the 9th of this month, he set off from Suiyuan by car with Ding Wangduoji, the Director of the Panchen Lama's Office in Suiyuan, passing through Wuchuan County and Niaolanhua, and arriving at Siziwang Mansion at 5 PM. Unexpectedly, the Panchen Lama had already moved to Xialamuoluo Temple to chant scriptures at 11 AM that morning. The temple was more than ninety miles northwest of the Mansion. He and others continued to travel there, but it was already late when they arrived at Gegen Temple, so they stayed there. The temple was more than twenty miles away from Xialamuoluo Temple. They were warmly received by the temple's managing lama, Nierba. The next morning, they set off again at 7 AM and arrived at Xialamuoluo Temple at 10 AM. At 2 PM, they paid homage to the Panchen Lama. They noted that the hairs on the Panchen Lama's face were more gray than the last time they saw him in Suiyuan. They asked the Panchen Lama about his experiences in proclaiming the Dharma in Xilin Gol League and the current situation of Inner Mongolian</p>
<p>Autonomy. The Panchen Lama replied that he had been to Xilin Gol League four times in total. The first time was when the banners of Xilin Gol League invited him to preach the Dharma. The second time was when the banners of Xilin Gol League invited him to recite the Kalachakra Tantra. He originally planned to spend the winter at Beizi Temple at the request of the League Banners, but before winter came, the Hailar Incident occurred, and Deputy Commander Zhang Hanqing sent someone to invite him to Shenyang for seventeen days to help resolve the Hailar issue. After the issue was resolved, he was invited to recite scriptures by Guitutong and Solun Banner. Then the September 18th Incident occurred, and he had no choice but to return from Liaoyang, passing through the border of Outer Mongolia and passing through Xilin Gol League once. This was the fourth time he had been to Xilin Gol League. He was originally invited by Su Wang (i.e., the Head of Xilin Gol League) to recite scriptures. He sent someone to invite him in January, but he did not go until May because he had not finished reciting scriptures in the western banners. Just then, the autonomy issue arose. He observed that the reasons were (1) There were many gaps in affection between that place and the interior; (2) They were influenced by Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia; (3) It was due to the Chahar Incident. The Mongolian princes had said to him that doing so could increase self-defense strength and consolidate border defense. He had been stationed there for a long time and observed that most princes and people were still inclined towards the central government and hoped that Minister Huang and Vice Chairman Zhao would come soon to discuss and formulate sound and concrete measures. The next day, they rested at the temple and saw the Panchen Lama's Great Khenpos and the temple's Living Buddha, Bolerdengdan Cijiasheng. At the same time, they also saw Siziwang and chatted very happily. On the third day (the 12th) morning, they bid farewell to the Panchen Lama. They set off at 3 PM and returned to Suiyuan yesterday (the 13th) at 4 PM. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Situation of Bloody Battles Between Soldiers and Bandits on the Border of Jiangxi and Fujian; Battles in Lichuan, Nancheng, and Yihuang; Bandits Collapse on All Fronts and Retreat Eastward <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xiao Jingxian, the commander-in-chief of the bogus Jiangxi-Fujian army, withdrew from Lichuan on the 28th of last month with the remnants of Fang Shao's bandits. At the same time, Peng Dehuai of the 3rd Army Corps, Lin Biao of the bogus 1st Army Corps, and Luo Binghui of the bogus 12th Army Corps suffered disastrous defeats in their attacks on Shaowu and Yanping. Zhu and Mao then ordered the bandits to concentrate in Guangze and advance on Lichuan through Shanguan and Xieshi, attempting a desperate gamble to break through eastern Jiangxi and spy on Fuzhou. However, the anti-bandit army's 囗 column of the northern route, Zhou Hunyuan's 囗 division and the 囗囗 division, had already captured Lichuan and seized Peng Dehuai's letter to Xiao Jingxian, learning of the bandits' conspiracy. They immediately deployed heavy troops to defend. By the beginning of this month, Zhu and Mao secretly concentrated the main forces from northern Fujian and advanced from the Shanguan and Xieshi areas, still using the strategy of concentrating their main forces on one point to attack part of the national army. They advanced towards Xunqiao in Lichuan, Xiaoshi in Nancheng, and Xinfeng Street, a transportation hub between Nancheng and Nanfeng. Yao Chun, Zhou Hunyuan, Wu Qiwu, Zhou Yan, and other units of the national army engaged in battle separately, bravely fighting back. Battles occurred in Lichuan, Nancheng, Nanfeng, and Zixi and the eastern regions. From the 10th to the 13th, blood battles lasted for four days and nights, and many bandits were killed. Yesterday, military sources said that the battle in Lichuan was over and the bandits had retreated eastward. The battles in Nancheng and Nanfeng are still raging. At the same time, there was also contact in Yihuang. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has sent a telegram to commend the armies participating in this battle, which shows the urgency of the situation at that time. The following is a record of the telegram: "According to Chief Commander Chen's repeated telegrams from Army Commander Zhou Yuxu, Qi Jiaheng, and others, our division's Ge Zhongshan brigade made a surprise attack from Lichuan, penetrated Feiyuan, and defeated the bandit army. On the way back to Xunqiao, it was ambushed by the main forces of the bogus 3rd Army Corps and the bogus 7th Army Corps. After fierce fighting for one day and night, it was rescued by friendly forces and the 31st Regiment was brought back to Lichuan. The 34th Regiment was isolated in Xunqiao and fought independently for five days and nights. With food and ammunition exhausted, they fought in hand-to-hand combat, relying on villages to defend and wait for rescue. At this time, our 囗囗 and 囗囗 divisions learned of the regiment's isolation and organized a commando to rush to the rescue, which was able to thwart the enemy's offensive and allow the entire regiment to withdraw. After investigation, it was found that Regiment Commander Weng was able to resist tens of thousands of bandits with the strength of one regiment for four or five days, and the officers and soldiers of the two divisions of 囗囗 and 囗囗 were able to rescue them despite the great risks and without missing the opportunity. This could not have been achieved without daily training and inherent loyalty and bravery. Upon hearing the report, I am deeply gratified and will give generous rewards and condolences separately to encourage them. (1) In this battle of Xunqiao, the 34th Regiment of the Ge Brigade is requested by the Central Party Department to be specially awarded the most glorious flag of bandit suppression to show their special merits. (2) The officers of the commando and Regiment Commander Weng of the two divisions of 囗囗 will be promoted one rank each, and each soldier will receive one month's extra pay. (3) The casualties of the commando and Regiment Commander Weng's officers and soldiers will be investigated and reported to be given double injury bonuses and condolence money, and honorable titles will be posthumously awarded. A telegram will also be sent to the anti-bandit forces, and in future anti-bandit operations, they should all have the spirit of adventure and hardship of our army's Weng Regiment and the commando, so that the team will not be the only ones with merit, and there are high hopes."

<p>[P Hua County Still Urgently Awaits Rescue; Yellow River Water Still Rises Occasionally; Number of Refugees Increases Daily</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The disaster situation in Hua County is extremely dire. Appeals have been made to all parties for relief, but the Yellow River water has risen again, and rescue is still urgently needed. Therefore, the Hua County Flood Relief Association recently sent another telegram to various parties appealing for relief, with extremely sincere words. The original text is as follows: "Since the Yellow River flooded Hua County, half of the county has been destroyed, and people have been drifting and displaced for more than two months. The tragic situation has been reported by telegram, and we have been grateful that the various Xian and good groups have sent personnel to investigate and provide relief. However, the River God is merciless, and the water volume rises occasionally. The great flood directly penetrates Hua County. Six hundred villages that could be crossed on foot have become a lake. Three hundred thousand people are still living in treetops. Silt blocks the roads, and there is no way to escape. They eat in the wind and sleep in the open, waiting to die. Fires have been extinguished, and cries are heard from time to time. News of deaths is frequent, and it is heartbreaking to speak of. Since the fish have risen in the past two days, the remaining survivors have fled one after another, supporting the old and carrying the young, coming one after another. Families that were once wealthy are now destitute. They are emaciated and unrecognizable to relatives and friends. Cries of hunger and cold are unbearable to hear. The number of people in the various shelters is increasing daily. The 3,000 stone of grain from the local donations has already been eaten more than half. It is estimated that it will be used up in ten days. Resources have been exhausted and there are no ways to remedy the situation. If we allow them to disperse, starvation is inevitable, and security is worrisome. We beg you to quickly provide urgent relief and release one yuan to save one life. No matter how much or how little, it is all a saving grace. If the disaster victims do not die, they will all praise the living Buddha. With tears in our eyes, we present our words and await orders in extreme sorrow. The Hua County Flood Relief Association bows in respect," (13th)</p>

<p>Meng Gu, a resident of the Mengjiazhai in the southeast of Nanxiang, was over sixty years old and owned more than ten mu of good farmland. Her sons and daughters-in-law had died early, and she lived alone. On the 13th night, thieves went to rob her, stabbing her to death and abandoning her body in a cotton field. At the time, neighbors did not hear anything. The next morning, neighbors, not seeing Gu, went to her house to check and found the door open and the boxes overturned, and realized that something had happened. They searched everywhere and finally found the abandoned body in the cotton field, where they found three stab wounds. The neighbors then went to the Qian Dachang Foreign Goods Store in Nanxiang Town to report to her son-in-law, Shen, who reported it to the county government for investigation and apprehension of the murderers.</p>

<p>Bao Sheng, from Baoying, and his nephew Gu Ruyi, sailed from their hometown to Suzhou to purchase cowhide for making wooden clogs. Eight fellow villagers, men and women, including Gu Yongtai, Luo Zhu, and Wang Wu, also came to Suzhou to work as hired laborers, so they came on the same boat. Unexpectedly, the boat was already near the suburbs of Suzhou, in the Baiyang Bay area of ​​Shiliting, when a bandit boat suddenly came from a branch harbor, fired a gun, and ordered them to stop. As a result, the ten people on board were searched, and then driven ashore. The bandits shook the boat and stolen goods away. Gu and others reported to the Third Public Security Sub-office. Inspector Zhang Lesan led the police to advance by land and water, and surrounded them from left and right. The two sides exchanged fire. After half an hour, the bandits could not hold on, abandoned the boat and fled ashore without being captured. Only the original boat and a bandit boat were shaken back to the office. Upon checking the lost items, only dozens of dollars in cash and more than a dozen pieces of clothing were found. The office then escorted the ten people from the entire case to the Third Bureau for questioning. After interrogation, they were all released on bail to retrieve their belongings.</p>
<p>Impersonating a Corpse's Family, Opening the Coffin for Examination</p>
<p>A bather wearing a Zhongshan suit with a Hubei accent came to the Tianyi Pool Bathhouse outside Changmen the day before yesterday (the 14th). After entering the pool, he suddenly fainted in the pool. The hall manager, Hang Zilong, hired a car to send him to the hospital, but he died on the way. The body was dragged back to Tianyi Pool. Afterwards, Zhang Xiaosan, a boatman who lived near the Hubei Guild Hall, said that the deceased's name was Zhang Minggan, and he was his cousin. He had been suffering from asthma, which caused his tragic death this time. He then filed a petition with the court to waive the examination. Zhang then took the corpse and had it coffined and buried. On the 18th, the 32nd Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area suspected that the case was highly suspicious. When Zhang Xiaosan was summoned for questioning, he stammered. Later, he confessed that his surname was actually Zhang. Because the deceased was a fellow villager, he had impersonated a relative to avoid the tragedy of being examined. The land guard, Xu Yong'an, and the car driver, Jiang Mingfu, who dragged the dead man, were also escorted to the court to await interrogation. Yesterday (the 19th), the court sent a prosecutor to open the coffin for examination. Although the examination proved that the deceased did die from suffocation and there was no other cause, the bizarre news of impersonating the dead man's family has spread throughout society.</p>

The first and second detachments of a squadron stationed in Hengjing, Wuxian County, patrolled the Huanglupu Zhuang area, and agreed to meet in Zhangjiabang. At 3 PM, when the team boat passed the Shilubang, a bandit boat was found in the reeds. They immediately surrounded and opened fire. The bandits also resisted stubbornly. As a result, five lake bandits, Chen Ada, Feng Laisheng, Zhang Haiwu, Zhou Heshang, and Wu Asan, all from Pinghu, were captured, as well as a boat, a single-shot Mauser rifle, sixty bullets, 114 yuan in banknotes, 174 yuan in silver dollars, 14,000 copper coins, and 16 small foreign coins. They were all escorted to the county government for questioning on the afternoon of the 19th.</p>

<p>Gu Suizhi, residing in the Lao Wu Shi town of this county, is</p>
<p>currently 46 years old. He married Chen, and they had two children. After Chen's death, Gu remarried Zhao. Nine years ago, Gu came to Changshu and worked as a clerk in the Yi Ji foreign goods company. His family resided at number 29 Yin Xian Street. Gu had been diligent and resourceful for seven years and four months and maintained his position. However, the store underwent reorganization last winter, leading to his unemployment. Gu's family was already poor, and he was subjected to ridicule, causing him great resentment. Recently, he contracted malaria and lacked the funds for treatment, leading him to contemplate suicide. On the 16th night, he suddenly bought several catties of yellow wine and drank alone, forcing his wife to sleep first. He then used scissors to cut off his testicles in an attempt to kill himself. However, due to his strong constitution, he failed. He then used the scissors to cut his throat and stabbed himself several times in the abdomen. His wife heard the noise and quickly lit a lamp to find her husband lying in a pool of blood. She cried loudly, waking the neighbors, who rushed him to the Yu He Hospital. Doctors at the hospital bandaged his wounds. He began to regain consciousness around 9 o'clock, and his mind was clear. However, it is said that his life remains in danger.</p>

<p>After the abolishment of the Finance Bureau in this county, matters regarding land tax were handled by the second section of the county government. Since Yan Shenyu became the magistrate of Wuxi, he has actively reorganized and strictly ordered Zhu Kaiguan, the director of land tax, to dispatch tax collectors to diligently collect taxes. The results have been excellent, allowing the province to receive its allocated funds on time each month. However, the old debts could not be cleared on schedule due to the county's financial constraints. The Finance Department, in order to clear the old debts of various counties, has organized a Land Tax Arrears Clearance Committee, assigning responsible personnel to implement clearance in various counties. Wang Xunyuan, assigned to this county, had previously come to Wuxi to supervise the collection. Subsequently, the Finance Department, seeing that the funds from this county had not been cleared, considered the collection efforts insufficient. Yesterday, they sent Wang again to Wuxi to urge collection. Wang went directly to the county government to discuss methods for clearing land tax arrears with Secretary Ye and ordered Zhu Kaiguan to strictly order the tax collectors to speed up tax collection in order to enrich the provincial treasury.</p>
<p>Failure to Conjure Silver from Tin Leads to Imprisonment</p>
<p>Shen Tianfu, the young master of Shen Changyuan rice store in Qingyang Town, Jiangyin, met Liu Zishan, a rice broker from Shanghai, (also known as Li Zishan, also named Cheng Fushou, a native of Xue Si Niang Bridge in Dang Kou) and Wang Fuxing on a train in August of the 20th year. Wang took out many mineral-like objects and told Shen that these minerals could be alchemized into silver using a medicinal liquid, yielding substantial profits. However, the medicinal liquid was in short supply, and the place of sale was very secretive, and the price was also expensive, and it must be purchased in person to be obtained. Shen was secretly pleased upon hearing this and invited Liu and others to his home to experiment. After Liu used the medicinal liquid to conjure, it did turn into silver. In fact, the test item was indeed real silver, and the rest were all tin and copper. Shen did not realize the fraud and was overjoyed. He immediately paid Liu and others 1,150 silver dollars, instructing them to go to Shanghai to purchase the medicinal liquid and return to Wuxi to conjure more. However, Liu and others never returned. Shen then realized he had been deceived. Until the other day, Shen encountered Liu Zishan in Sheng Alley in this county and</p>
<p>dragged him to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who transferred him to the county court. After Chief Zhou held a trial, Shen Tianfu was ordered to return home, and Liu Zishan was detained to await further investigation.</p>

<p>Recently, malignant malaria has been discovered in Wu County. The symptoms include persistent high fever, which does not subside with sweating. The symptoms are very similar to typhoid fever and cannot be confirmed without a blood test. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners often mistake this disease for typhoid fever or damp-heat. This disease is very dangerous. The bacteria invade the brain, causing madness, similar to meningitis, eventually leading to coma and death. The origin of this disease is likely due to transmission by venomous mosquitoes. If treated properly in the early stages, there is no danger to life. However, in recent days, there have been many patients in the north of the city and elsewhere, and the disease is spreading. Countless people have died in vain.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the 23rd Brigade of the 6th District of the Water Police stationed in Xiannv Temple seizing a large quantity of opium, it is now known that this opium consists of 334 packages, each weighing 50 taels, with a total value of over 30,000 gold pieces. The brigade only delivered 160 packages to the Guazhou district headquarters. At that time, the district headquarters had already apprehended a certain adjutant of a unit escorting this opium from Hankou. His weapons were immediately confiscated, and a shipping invoice for 334 packages was found on his person. It was then believed that the 23rd Brigade had embezzled too much. Inspector Xing was immediately dispatched with a team on the Huai'an warship to Xiannv to investigate. The brigade's leader, Tuo, then handed over another 111 packages, leaving 60 packages missing. It is claimed that these have been used as rewards for the informant. The disposition of the case is not yet known. However, it is rumored that the opium was transported from Hankou by Jiang Songyan, a major opium dealer from Fanchuan. According to reports, Jiang had previously transported 63 boxes of opium, which were seized and divided up by the Public Security Bureau of the Seventh District of this county. The provincial government issued a circular order for strict arrest, but the case has not yet been closed.</p>

It has seven spans, totaling over 660 feet in length. The bridge piers are made of concrete, and the bridge beams and deck are made of steel, with a total weight of approximately 200 tons. The entire bridge pier and deck engineering was contracted by Shanghai Yangzi Construction Company. The steel materials used were specially ordered from famous German factories. The total cost is over 110,000 yuan, and the official opening is scheduled for the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Fire in Baoji Guan Alley Last Night</p>
<p>Zhang A'yang, a resident of No. 16 Baoji Guan Alley in Hangzhou, operates a foreign textile business. At 7:15 p.m. on the 18th, Zhang was out on business and had not returned. His wife went upstairs to sleep, but the kerosene lamp accidentally overturned, igniting the bed curtains. The fire was fierce. Fortunately, the fire brigade and fire engines rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It took half an hour to extinguish the fire. A total of two houses belonging to the Zhu Wu family at No. 18 were burned down, resulting in a loss of approximately over 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>This county has repeatedly received provincial orders to recruit 100 conscripts to be transferred to the bandit suppression army in Jiangxi. However, due to the difficulty of handling the matter and the inability to recruit, the province was requested to reduce the quota to 50 conscripts, but the handling still felt difficult. The Public Security Bureau, compelled by the provincial order, had no choice but to change the recruitment to a draft. The Second District was required to draft five conscripts, which were forcibly drafted the night before (17th). One of them, Li A'si, was a railroad worker who was already old. Therefore, the railroad workers requested an exemption from conscription. However, the branch bureau did not grant their request. The railroad workers were enraged and forcibly took Li A'si back. A conflict broke out, and all the workshop rooms, sloping glass, tables, chairs, and utensils were destroyed. One of the road workers was injured. The road workers became even more enraged and gathered over 40 followers, tying up all the police officers. The branch bureau chief rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, intending to mediate. However, the road workers were overwhelming and surrounded the branch bureau chief, intending to beat him severely. The station master rushed to persuade them, but to no avail. The railway department's inspector happened to be in Feng, and the county government also received a telegram notifying them that the incident was expanding. The county immediately dispatched Police Brigade Captain Wang Jikang, leading many police officers, to join Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Yanwu. Only then did the Xu branch bureau chief escape danger. The authorities demanded that the station master hand over the troublemaking workers to the county for severe punishment. The road workers reported to the engineering office and the Shanghai-Hangzhou section inspector, demanding a satisfactory resolution, or they would all go on strike as a threat.</p>

<p>To the Editor: I recently read a report in your newspaper's Hangzhou news column on October 17th about a Central Aviation School car with the number 104 injuring a person near Yangba Tou. After investigation, our school does not have a car with the number 104, nor is there a driver named Wang Sisou. Moreover, our school's cars have never injured anyone outside of the school. We believe that your newspaper's reporting is inaccurate and should be corrected. Sincerely, Central Aviation School, October 17th</p>

<p>All railways have designated joint freight stations for the Shanghai-Beiping joint freight train service. The Railway Department has instructed the Tianjin-Pukou, Beiping-Liaoning, and Shanghai-Nanjing Railways to handle it as appropriate. The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway has designated Trains No. 401 and No. 402 as Shanghai-Beiping joint freight trains, which will be implemented on the day of the Capital Ferry opening ceremony on the 22nd of this month. However, the operation will depend on the amount of freight. It is scheduled to run once a day between Shanghai and Beiping. The schedule for the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is as follows: Train No. 402 departs from Shanghai Meigen Road Station at 5:20 PM and arrives at the Nanjing riverside at 6:40 AM the next morning.

<h3 id="e112">Responsible Freight <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Department issued an instruction to the various railway bureaus, stating that the purpose of the Ministry's order for all railways to implement responsible freight transportation was originally to facilitate freight merchants and ensure the safety of their goods. If responsible goods are lost or damaged, compensation should be determined and paid quickly in accordance with regulations to show good faith. However, the various railways often use the excuse that the responsibility of the personnel involved has yet to be investigated and processed, which often takes one or two months to decide on compensation. In some cases, even a small portion of the loss involves all the goods, and other parts that have not suffered any loss are also detained. This is clearly contrary to the</p>
<p>original intent of responsible freight and is not the way to protect freight merchants. It should be noted that compensation for losses is the railway's responsibility to the freight merchant, while the responsibility of the personnel involved is an internal matter of the railway and should not be confused. It is now stipulated that compensation must be paid within 20 days from the date the station master receives the "claim for compensation" and must not be delayed. The parts that have not suffered any loss should also be allowed for the freight merchants to pick up first in accordance with regulations. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby urgently ordered that the railway bureau comply with this order.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Ministry of Finance Issues Instruction to Lift Restrictions on Customs, Grain, and Duty-Free Exports to Encourage Trade <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the national agricultural output has been relatively abundant, and grain reserves are plentiful. As a result, the prices of agricultural products have gradually declined, causing great hardship to farmers. In view of this, the government has opened up the rice market and exempted export tariffs. The customs authorities have received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Ministry of Finance Instruction <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Since China opened up to trade with various countries, rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains have been designated as prohibited items for export. Rice and wheat that have already been imported from overseas are also treated as domestic products and cannot be re-exported. This was originally intended to maintain the people's food supply. However, the situation has changed, and the import of foreign rice and wheat is increasing daily, causing domestic grain prices to fall, even below the cost of production. If the ban on exports continues, it will only make it more difficult for food to circulate and will be detrimental to the rural economy, which will have a significant impact. This is not a suitable approach for the current situation. The Ministry has specially informed the Executive Yuan that the original ban on exporting rice, wheat, and other grains should be lifted and that they should be allowed to be sold and transported freely.</p>
<p>The export taxes, both domestic and foreign, will be exempted to facilitate circulation and benefit agriculture. If it becomes necessary to limit exports in the future, a ban will be re-imposed. This was approved by the 128th meeting of the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry to instruct the customs authorities to comply. In addition to instructing the General Affairs Department to issue an order to the customs commissioners to stop the ban on exporting rice, wheat, sorghum, millet, buckwheat, corn, and other miscellaneous grains that were originally prohibited, and to exempt them from export taxes, this order is hereby issued to the supervisor for compliance.</p>

<p>Flour industry representatives gathered yesterday at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road to discuss whether the Ministry of Finance's exemption of export taxes on rice and wheat included flour. Furthermore, they noted that the flour market is deteriorating daily, and all factories are on the verge of collapse. They proposed that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry be requested to grant exemptions from all taxes and levies on flour, in accordance with the grain tax exemption instruction, in order to maintain the industry. The flour industry representatives have submitted the above points to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for approval.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Japan is dumping warehouse-aged rice in China. The Chamber of Commerce has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry requesting the imposition of rice taxes. The first batch of Japanese rice, totaling 25,000 bags, has arrived in Shanghai and is being stockpiled at Yongxing Warehouse in Pudong. Shenfeng and other eight rice merchants are underwriting the second batch, but loading has already been stopped. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Dumping of Japanese Rice <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Japan, facing a backlog of warehouse-aged rice and a bumper harvest of new grains, has decided to sell a total of 50,000 bags of warehouse-aged rice and store new rice instead. However, the sale of aged rice would inevitably lead to a fall in rice prices. To avoid the decline and affect the livelihood of farmers, the aged rice is being dumped in China, entrusted to the Shanghai American company Hanlai Road Foreign Company for sale in Shanghai. After the Ningbo Association received a telegram, it immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to report. The Chamber of Commerce believed that this year's new grains from various provinces would soon be on the market, and if Japanese rice arrived in Shanghai, it would inevitably affect the prices of new rice. Therefore, it sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, urging them to quickly impose taxes on foreign rice.</p>
<h3 id="e118">First Batch Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>A total of 50,000 bags of Japanese rice,</p>
<p>aged rice from Yangon stockpiled 20</p>
<p>years ago, are being managed by the American company Hanlai Road Foreign Company and sold to eight rice merchants in Shanghai's South City, including Shenfeng, who are distributing and underwriting the rice. Each bag weighs 200 bags, or 150 catties, and is priced at 6.3 yuan per bag in Chinese currency. The rice is being shipped to Shanghai in two batches, with delivery at Shanghai warehouses. The first batch of 25,000 bags has already arrived in Shanghai by Japanese ship and unloaded at Yongxing Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong. However, the warehouse is operated by a foreign company, and the warehouse manager is Chinese.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Purchasing Process <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Gu Xinyi of the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday. According to him, the Japanese warehouse-aged rice being shipped to Shanghai was purchased by eight rice merchants in Shanghai, totaling 50,000 bags. The reason for the purchase is that the above-mentioned eight rice merchants already had stocks of foreign rice, and they were afraid that the price of foreign rice would fall after the Hanlai Road Foreign Company sold Yangon foreign rice. Moreover, the principle of levying import taxes on foreign rice has been passed and is likely to be implemented. Therefore, they jointly purchased the rice for delivery at Shanghai warehouses.</p>

<p>As for the first batch of Japanese warehouse rice that has already arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>and been unloaded in Pudong, totaling 25,000</p>
<p>bags, the association has informed the eight merchants that the Yangon rice purchased from the Hanlai Road Foreign Company is actually Japanese warehouse-aged rice. The rice merchants did not know this when they placed the order. After being notified, they immediately negotiated with the Hanlai Road Foreign Company, urging them to quickly send a telegram to Japan to stop loading the second batch of Japanese warehouse rice. It is said that the foreign company has agreed to send a telegram to Japan to stop loading.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Telephone Company's Request for Price Increase; Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Consider it Slowly; Information Office Releases Original Letter from the Company <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council discussed the telephone company's request for a price increase on the 13th of this month. After careful consideration, the committee members believed that the telephone company's proposal, in its current form, was not appropriate for approval. However, the financial issues involved in this case are also related to the French Concession Municipal Council. Therefore, this matter can be considered at a later date. This opinion was recorded in the minutes of the meeting. The minutes were submitted to the board of directors on the 18th and approved for record after some discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Request for Price Increase <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council on August 15th of this year requesting a price increase. The main points of the original letter were released by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office yesterday. The following is a summary: The Shanghai Telephone Company took over the former company in 1930 and immediately began converting to automatic switchboards. This work was completed within the concession on March 26th of last year. Since that date, telephone charges have been increased separately based on Anson's report. The company sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council on August 5th, 1930, stating that the company would not request a price increase within three years of the implementation of Anson's prices. However, the situation has changed greatly since August 1930.</p>
<p>Because the exchange rate calculated by Anson was 61.839 US dollars per 100 taels of silver, while the average in the company's accounts was only 32.901 US dollars per 100 taels, the cost increased significantly, and the amount of income was not sufficient to be profitable. Under these circumstances, the letter of August 5th, 1930, cannot be strictly interpreted, and the Shanghai Municipal Council must be asked to consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Benefits Obtained by Users Throughout the City <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The period for converting to automatic switchboards was originally set at two years, but it was actually completed in only 599 days. Furthermore, the number of calls since the conversion to automatic switchboards has approximately doubled, compared to the estimate as of the end of May 1933, which was</p>
<p>133. Since users have increased convenience in these several aspects, it does not seem appropriate for the company to bear the losses alone.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Difficult Financial Situation of the Company <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The company has been losing money ever since the takeover. It lost a total of 270,028 taels from August 1930 to March 1932, and 72,000 taels from April 1932 to May 1933. Dividends have not been distributed to shareholders, and reserves cannot be allocated. If prices are not increased in the future, the company will lose 167,000 taels per year. The company's costs include 8,796,093 taels for the purchase of the old company and 17,735,452 taels for the new company's expenses up to the end of July 1932, totaling over 26 million taels. Of this, 5,757,100 taels were invested by shareholders, and the rest was paid for with company bonds and loans.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Comparison with Major Cities in Europe and America <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Telephones in Shanghai make 906 calls per day, which is two to three times more than in some major cities in Europe and America. However, the cost of a call is approximately 2.2 cents in Shanghai for commercial use, while it is 1.16 yuan in Philadelphia, USA. For residential use, it is 2.7 cents in Shanghai and 1.22 yuan in Philadelphia. The installation cost per telephone is over 624 taels in Shanghai, while it is mostly 700 to 800 taels in European and American cities. The</p>
<p>difficulty lies in the fact that the ratio of income to cost is too low.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Extent of Losses Suffered by the Company <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Taking the 14 months from April 1932 to May 1933 as an example, the net income should have been 3,115,000 taels according to the amount permitted by the contract (i.e., 8% of the investment, plus 2% for reserves). However, the actual net income was only 1,441,000 taels, a shortfall of 1,674,000 taels. This includes 979,000 taels of dividends payable but not paid, 623,000 taels of reserves payable but not paid, and an actual loss of 72,000 taels. The losses suffered by shareholders and reserves are what users have saved.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Request for a Price Increase is Only for Compensation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The company is not disregarding the original letter of August 5th, 1930, but only wishes to obtain an income that is lower than what is permitted by the contract within these three years. Since the installation of the automatic switchboards has been completed, it does not seem appropriate to allow the company to continue operating at a loss for so long. Furthermore, shareholders should receive at least a minimum dividend within these three years. As for the reserves, they can be set aside after three years. Therefore, the company's request is to allow a price increase from now until the end of March 1935 (i.e., when the three-year period ends) to generate a revenue of 1,061,000 taels. This number is calculated based on: (1) Compensating for the actual loss of 37,000 taels (expected to be lost by then), and (2) Paying a 4% interest rate for the three-year period on the 5,757,100 taels of paid-in capital, totaling 691,000 taels. If this request is approved by September 20th of this year, it can be implemented on December 1st, in which case the increase should be allocated over 16 months, requiring a price increase of 20.07%. If it is approved by December 20th and implemented on March 1st of next year, it must be allocated over 13 months, requiring a price increase of 24.70%.</p>

<p>According to the New News Agency, Li Zeyi, a member of the Administrative Yuan's Pacification and Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Peiping, arrived in Shanghai from Peiping the day before yesterday and boarded the Japanese mail steamer Nagasaki Maru at 9:00 AM yesterday, bound for Japan. He is expected to arrive in Kobe by tomorrow morning. Mr. Li told reporters who visited him on the ship that the purpose of this trip was to finalize the remaining procedures for the construction of the Ninghai warship, as he was responsible for the negotiations when the ship was originally ordered from Japan. He also intends to take the opportunity to visit his son, who has been receiving treatment in Tokyo for hemiplegia for the past two years. He is eager to see how he is doing. Therefore, after arriving in Kobe, he plans to stay for two or three days before proceeding to Tokyo. External reports suggest that he is carrying some sort of mission, but this is merely speculation. However, other reports indicate that Mr. Li's trip to Japan is to assist Chiang Tso-pin, the ambassador to Japan, in Sino-Japanese diplomatic activities. This is noted for verification.</p>

<p>Guangdong sugar merchants held a meeting yesterday to welcome and discuss relief measures. Due to the suspicion that Hainan Island's local sugar was adulterated with foreign sugar, it was repeatedly confiscated and heavily fined by the Qiongzhou Customs, causing great losses to local merchants and farmers. Therefore, representatives, including Xing Juefei, were sent north to appeal to the central government. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. Since the representative arrived in Shanghai, he has announced the matter to all parties and requested assistance from organizations such as the National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Association in Shanghai, and representatives of various counties in South China, including Li Yansheng from Qinlian, Li Wenhua from Huizhou, Zhao Yuanshan from Gaozhou, Wan Minyi from Hainan Island, and Guangdong sugar merchants. All believe that this matter has a great impact on the commerce and livelihood of farmers in South China and have expressed their utmost support in appealing to the central government and ensuring the safety of Hainan sugar exports in the future. It is reported that Representative Xing yesterday also personally presented the details of the Qiongzhou Customs' seizure of Hainan Island's local sugar to Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, requesting his strong assistance. It is said that after hearing about this matter, Director Wen, considering that the agriculture of his hometown is in the process of recovery and is being devastated, expressed his willingness to provide assistance. The Guangdong sugar merchants of Guang'an Tang, wanting to understand the true situation, specially hosted a banquet at Xinghualou last night, inviting Representative Xing to attend and report on the matter. It is reported that the representative will visit Tang Haian, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, again today to request assistance. It is also reported that Representative Xing has scheduled to go to Peiping to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, hoping to achieve the desired outcome.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, Requesting that They Order the Release of Hainan Island Products <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, based on a letter from Xing Juefei, the representative of the Hainan Island Sugar Merchants and the Haikou Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance due to the wanton destruction of local sugar, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Customs Administration, requesting that they order the release of local sugar and prevent further obstruction in the future. The original telegram is excerpted below (titles omitted): "Recently, we received a letter from Xing Juefei, the representative of the Hainan Island Sugar Merchants and the Haikou Chamber of Commerce, stating that (details omitted, as seen in the 18th issue of the newspaper). Respectfully presented by Lin, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, etc., based on this, we have found that currently, only the Fujian and Guangdong provinces produce sugar in our country, and Hainan Island produces the most. If we do not take measures to promote it and allow it to be destroyed, domestic sugar will disappear from the market and we will consume only foreign sugar. The Qionghai Customs has created difficulties in the past, and the Jianghai Customs is now auctioning goods, which is a major blow to domestic sugar. We hereby telegraph to your ministry for review and approval, earnestly requesting that you quickly order the Qiongjiang Customs to release the seized local sugar, return the collected fines, and prevent intentional obstruction of local sugar exports in the future, in order to maintain domestic production. Respectfully, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Industrial Circle of This City is Planning Proposals for the National Production Conference, Focusing on Centralized Organization, Expanding the Quantity of Raw Materials, Promoting Production and Sales Cooperation, and Relieving Industrial Finance <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, in view of the declining domestic production, has decided to hold a National Production Conference in Hangzhou on the first of next month to discuss relief measures. The industrial circle of this city is currently planning all the proposals to be submitted to the conference for discussion. The Central News Agency reporter inquired about the situation from the industrial circle of this city yesterday, and the information obtained is as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Motivation for Convening the Conference <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the status of China's industrial production has undergone tremendous changes. Under such circumstances, if no concrete measures are taken to remedy the situation, not only will the existing production be on the verge of extinction, but the emerging industries will find it even more difficult to establish themselves. In December of the 21st year of the Republic of China, during the plenary session, representatives from the industrial circle of this city, who were all gathered in Shanghai, presented the difficulties of the industry. They received instructions to convene a production conference independently under the guidance of the government. At the same time, the government also opened up and used the strength of all parties to enable the resolutions of the conference to be realized through political power. The process of the negotiations at that time was to draft a proposal for convening a production conference, which was considered satisfactory by Committee Member Wu and others, who personally revised it. It was submitted to the Third Plenary Session on December 10, 21st year of the Republic of China and was passed in full on December 19th of the same month. It was handed over to the Executive Yuan to instruct the competent authorities to handle it. This is the general situation of the motivation for the production conference at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e135">General Decline in Production <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the decline in domestic production has been such that not only are the industrial raw materials required by the general large industries in the country purchased from abroad, but also the agricultural raw materials such as wheat and cotton, which are used to manufacture cotton yarn and flour, are mostly imported from foreign countries. For example, the national cotton production is estimated at more than 6.4 million piculs per year, while in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Chinese cotton production was 6,793,241 piculs, and the import of American cotton reached 4,652,726 piculs. The national wheat production is 8 million piculs per year, while in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the import of foreign wheat reached 22,773,424 piculs, valued at Customs Silver 7,639,301 taels. The trend will only increase in the future. Other industrial raw materials, such as phosphorus for matches, nitric acid soda for bleaching and dyeing, pigments for printing and dyeing, woolen yarn for knitting, and tobacco leaves for cigarettes, are imported annually, valued at over 300 million taels of Customs Silver. Various procedures for exploring and paying prices are affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and are also subject to foreign commercial trusts.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, China is still a producing country. If it can actively reorganize and strive for progress, starting with the four items of cotton, wheat, wool, and tobacco leaves, it is not impossible to achieve self-sufficiency and alleviate a portion of the economic pressure. The import of cotton accounts for the top position of customs imports, and China's cotton land is as much as 35,468,352 mu, ranking second in the world in cotton production. The area north of the Yellow River and west of Huaihai is the center of wheat production, with an area of over 485 million mu. Furthermore, Sichuan and Shandong provinces produce a large amount of tobacco, and wool is a special product of northern Hebei. As long as breeding is improved and incentives are provided, it may not be necessary to rely on foreign goods in two or three years.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Improving the Freight System <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>To alleviate the decline in production, in addition to encouraging production, the freight system should be improved first. In countries with developed production, the three items of production, transportation, and sales are connected and consistent. From production to transportation to sales, each item has an independent organization, and then each organization is merged into a single general organization for operation. With strong strength and low consumption, goods can reduce prices and compete with overseas goods. The wealth of the country will also increase accordingly. On the other hand, in China, agricultural products cannot raise prices due to the lack of transit agents. Factory products are immediately owned by merchants because there is no industrial specialized transportation agency. Over time, transportation agents have to rely on customs brokers and transit companies to perform their labor. The impact is that not only is the price of goods in the producing and selling areas far apart, but also the hub of national production and transit is controlled by middlemen. The connection between production and sales is cut off, and the purchasing power of users is reduced accordingly. The direct and indirect intangible consumption can brew a fundamental crisis in national production. For now, the only way is for the government to plan for the industrial circle and order the investment organization to run a large-scale industrial transit company within a short period of time, and to detail the company's business and management rules. At the same time, it will also order local customs and railways to set up special commercial cargo transit points, so that all goods can be picked up, transported, and dispatched upon arrival. In addition, it will encourage domestic banks to provide more mortgages for such cargo transportation, providing practical double convenience. In this way, at the same time</p>
<p>By communicating between the production and sales sides, the price of goods will naturally be cheaper, and purchasing power will be strengthened, preventing the stagnation of goods. The domestic and foreign markets will also be opened up by this.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Proposals Are Being Drafted <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The National Production Conference is scheduled to be held in Hangzhou on the first of next month. Industrial circles in various places are currently recommending representatives and drafting proposals to be submitted to the conference for discussion. The industrial circle of this city is discussing the candidates for representatives and proposals. The general ideas of the proposals include the following points: (1) Systematically merge and centralize various existing investigation and agricultural planting agencies and groups in China to expand the quantity of raw material production. (2) Cooperate with the financial sector to organize industrial transportation agencies. (3) Promote production and sales cooperation, so that the domestic market is gradually dominated by domestic goods. (4) Generate a center of gravity for industrial organizations and ask the government to formulate separate industrial group organization laws. (5) Revise industrial and commercial laws and regulations, and abolish those that are not practical. (6) Relieve industrial finance and advocate that financial institutions use at least a certain percentage of cash each year for industrial purposes.</p>

<p>The Marine Fisheries Administration of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region of the Ministry of Industry has allocated warships to protect fishing due to the approaching autumn fishing season and has ordered ten fishing boats from Germany to expand its armed forces. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Warships Dispatched to Protect Fishing in Different Areas <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang fishing season is between September and October, mostly between Chongming, Wenzhou, and Xiangshan. The bureau has now allocated all warships and dispatched them to protect fishing, including (1) the Haiying warship from Chongming to Haizhou Bay, (2) the Qing'an warship patrolling from Shengshan Majishan to Wusongkou, (3) the Haigu warship stationed at Huangshitang, patrolling Dachen Mountain, Heishan, the North and South Yushan, and the Feishan Islands, (4) the Haihong warship docked at Shenjiamen, patrolling Peach Blossom Island, Zhujia Island, and Donghuo Mountain, and (5) the Biaohai warship patrolling various areas.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Ten Fishing Boats Ordered from Germany <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In order to gain the trust of fishermen and to encourage fish merchants to pay construction fees, the Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Municipal Government jointly operate the municipal fish market, actively building meteorological stations and fishing ports. Recently, it has ordered ten new-style fishing boats from the German Xiwang Company at a price of approximately 2 million yuan, with payments made in installments to avoid financial difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Fishing Construction Fees Cannot Be Collected <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The fishing construction fees collected by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee have been in dispute since the fish merchants refused to pay, and it has been unresolved for half a year. Although sea celebrities Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng have repeatedly mediated, they have ultimately been ineffective. Only fish merchants in inland areas have paid, and there is no solution in this city. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry will take further measures to respond.</p>

<p>Chen Wenlin, Director of the Xiamen Naval Aviation Office, and Pan Dingxin, Head of the Mechanical Section, departed from Xiamen in the self-made Jiangque aircraft to make a national flight. After returning to Shanghai from Peiping, the plane landed at Hongqiao Airport. The installation of a new 120-horsepower engine from the British Harmanes factory has been completed, and the test flight was excellent. It was decided to depart from Shanghai this morning at 11:00 AM and fly to Xiamen, scheduled to arrive in Hangzhou at about 1:00 PM that afternoon, staying overnight. The next morning, it will take off from Hangzhou, pass through Ningbo, and arrive in Fuzhou on the same day, staying overnight for one day. The following morning, it will fly from Fuzhou to Xiamen, rest briefly, and handle various important documents of the Aviation Office before making a South China flight to complete the national plan. Last night, Zeng Yijing, Director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, held a farewell dinner for Chen Wenlin and Pan Dingxin at the Naval Social Club on Lūbān Road. However, because Mr. Pan Dingxin suffered from an eye disease, he decided to stay in Shanghai temporarily, and pilot Gao Shenghai will accompany Chen on the flight from Shanghai to Hangzhou this morning. The self-made Jiangfeng and Jianghe aircraft of the Aircraft Manufacturing Office were originally intended to fly to Xiamen with the Jiangque aircraft, but because the Jianghe paint was not completed, the flight was rescheduled.</p>

<p>According to the Mainland News, the Soviet Aid Society (British) has been engaged in import and export trade in China and has recently borrowed long-term accounts from various Chinese banks. Yesterday, a spokesman for the society stated that it intends to continue to ask various Chinese banks to lend long-term loans of 3 to 3.5 million taels of silver in order to purchase Chinese tea and transport it to the Soviet Union, because the tea trade between China and Russia has recently become increasingly prosperous, so it is necessary to borrow this money. It is reported that the loan will be guaranteed by the Far East Bank for twelve months. What the opinions of the various Chinese banks are is not yet known.</p>

<p>Silk and silk dyeing workers have always had very low wages and rely entirely on wine allowances to maintain their livelihood. Recently, various dyeing workshops have arbitrarily reduced or even canceled the wine allowance, causing outrage among the workers. After repeated dispatching of personnel to negotiate, there have been no results. At 9:00 PM the night before last, a joint meeting of the two industry executives was convened, attended by more than 30 people. The chairman, Wei Yi, reported that the capitalists destroyed the conditions and exploited the wine allowance, and the workers had a difficult livelihood. It was decided to declare a strike on the 20th to promote the awareness of the capitalists.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Strike Notice <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dyeing Industry Trade Union Silk and Silk Office issued a notice of intention to strike yesterday based on the resolution, stating that the workers' wine allowance, which they rely on to maintain their livelihood, has now been almost completely deprived. If they do not rise up and fight for it, they will inevitably sit and wait for death. The office has, in addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for relief, followed the will of all workers and decided at the executive committee organizing committee meeting that for customers, goods will be accepted until the 20th of this month. On the 21st, only the finishing touches will be allowed, and white embryos will not be allowed to enter the tank. From the 22nd, whether it is a white embryo or finishing touches, it will not be allowed to enter the tank. All members must comply with the regulations and must not destroy them. It is hoped that this will be strictly observed. This is a special notice.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Brigadier General Who Shines Shoes, Jiang Minsheng, Develops a New Way to Save the Country; The Dahua Pencil Factory Entrusts Him to Sell 30,000 Pencils; 30% of the Profits Will Be Used as a Fund to Aid Northeastern Refugees; Jiang Minsheng Organizes a Planning Group to Address the Livelihood Problems of Northeastern Refugees <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese General Jiang Minsheng, wandering at sea and shining shoes to make a living, caused a sensation. Newspapers competed to report on his whereabouts. He also published his monthly income in full, and the surplus was sent to the Shanghai charitable organizations within the United Federation for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees to relieve Northeastern compatriots. Although it was a drop in the bucket, it won the sympathy of patriots in society. The Dahua Pencil Factory in this city had previously donated 240 dozen pencils, instructing him to sell them, which was quite successful, and the proceeds were also donated to aid Northeastern compatriots. Dahua recently sent another letter to Mr. Jiang.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Dahua's Original Letter <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Minsheng, Northeast is unfortunate and is invaded by the Japanese, causing the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast to be in dire straits. Your anti-Japanese spirit is admired by the whole country. All affected compatriots should be assisted as much as possible. The factory has this purpose and has discussed with you several times. Now, it is approved to entrust you to lead the affected compatriots to various places to sell 30,000 pencils of the factory's products, totaling 126,000 yuan. In the future, 30% of the sales proceeds, totaling 37,800 yuan, will be used as a fund to fundamentally aid the affected Northeastern compatriots and for the expenses required for sales. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is also a way to help and the obligation that compatriots should fulfill. I hereby announce this and wish you well. Wu Zhongshan.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Request for Supervision <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Minsheng, upon receiving this letter, felt that the factory's enthusiasm for public welfare and the current urgency for relief for the Northeastern compatriots seemed to make him able to take on the responsibility of sales. However, the number was too large, and he was deeply worried about any mistakes. He sent a letter to the Shanghai charitable organizations, the United Federation for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees, requesting that someone be sent to supervise in order to show good faith. On October 7th, he received a reply from the association, "In response, we received a letter stating that Manager Wu Zhongshan of the Dahua Pencil Factory in Shanghai is willing to entrust you with the sales of 30,000 pencils of the factory's products, and to take 30% of the proceeds for the relief of Northeastern refugees. You asked this association to send someone to supervise it for the sake of trustworthiness, showing modesty and humility. We are very appreciative of your reputation for trustworthiness. From past events, it is deeply admired by colleagues, and there is no need to send anyone. We hereby reply in a corresponding letter, hoping for your review and compliance." Mr. Jiang Minsheng, with righteousness in mind, cannot shirk his responsibility. However, the matter is too complicated, and he is sincerely afraid that the wrong person will be entrusted, or that his credibility will be undermined. He is currently recruiting capable young people from the Northeastern refugees who have difficult and hard lives to first organize a "Planning Group to Address the Livelihood Problems of Northeastern Refugees." Mr. Jiang will lead the group members to carry out a pilot sales plan. On the one hand, in Peiping, Tianjin, and other places, members of the group will be assigned to sell separately, and the proceeds will be delivered to the Shanghai charitable organizations at any time to the United Federation for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees for proper management, in order to relieve Northeastern refugees.</p>

<p>The home of Chen Yusheng, a silk businessman from Nanjing, located at No. 5 Mingyuefang, Lane 48, Lümi Road, Fangbang Bridge, French Concession, was suddenly attacked by three robbers with pistols at 5:00 PM on the 6th of this month. They were robbed of cash, gold, jewelry, diamonds, watches, and other items worth a total of 571 yuan. After the victim opened a list of losses and reported it to the patrol, the patrol arrested Liu Asi, a robber in the case, and sent him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Now, the detectives Jin Jiulin, Zhang Ziying, and Zhou Buguang arrested three accomplices, Li Liansheng, 28 years old from Nanjing, Guo Changchun, 28 years old from Hubei, Wang Ada, 28 years old from Baoshan, etc., at 8:20 PM the night before last in Caishi Street. A fake pistol was found and taken to the patrol. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Li Changnian interrogated them. First, the patrol lawyer Yao Zhaodi stated the facts of the case, stating that the patrol had not yet investigated the three defendants and requested a postponement to investigate and request a verdict on the case of the arrested robber Liu Asi. The court verified the report, briefly interrogated the defendants, and then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, allowing a postponement until the 27th to be tried together with the Liu Asi case.</p>

<p>Previously, the China Eastern Tobacco Company, to promote its Betel Nut brand cigarettes, issued a type of promotional coupon totaling one million numbers, divided into front and back groups. Five Betel Nut cigarette hard packs could be exchanged for one coupon. The prize numbers were determined according to the procedures of the Nationalist Government's first aviation lottery. The first prize was 5,000 yuan. On July 31st, the official lottery draw was held, and the first prize number was 226622, won by Zhu Wenjiang, a Chinese detective from the General Inspectorate, who claimed his prize according to regulations. However, Zhu Qichang and Li Dongtao claimed to also hold a first prize-winning coupon. Unable to collect the prize money, they initiated criminal proceedings against Li Xuedong, the manager of the China Eastern Company, in the Special District Court. After clear questioning and evidence, Li was found not guilty. Details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. It is now reported that Li Xuedong, believing that Zhu and Li's coupons, although not forged, undoubtedly had their numbers privately reprinted, hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Chen Zhongyin to file a criminal lawsuit against Zhu Qichang and Li Dongtao with the First Special Court for forgery. The court ordered summons, and yesterday afternoon, Bailiff Liu Yugui came to the Second Criminal Court to begin the trial. Both defendants failed to appear despite being summoned. Chen Zhongyin, the attorney representing the plaintiff, stated that the defendants Zhu and Li had repeatedly failed to appear in court during the previous trials of their case against his client, Li Xuedong. After the verdict in that case, they appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court, but again failed to appear after several summonses, so their appeal was rejected. Now that his client had filed a lawsuit for forgery, and the court had legally summoned the defendants, their failure to appear was a blatant disregard of the law and deliberate evasion. He requested the court to issue arrest warrants to bring them to justice according to the law. Bailiff Liu reported the matter and the court ordered the case to be adjourned until Zhu Qichang and Li Dongtao could be arrested and brought to court for questioning.</p>

<p>The city's zoo on Wenmiao Road previously had animal enclosures that were too small and lacked adequate facilities, leading to an incident of a bear escaping. The zoo's director, Shen Xiangrui, had submitted a request to the Education Bureau, which was then forwarded to the city government, requesting funds to build two larger animal enclosures to house more aggressive animals. The city government has approved the request, deeming it urgently needed, and has instructed the Finance Bureau to work with the Education Bureau to proceed with the construction. The zoo's budget proposal included 4,800 yuan for two large animal enclosures, 918 yuan for reinforcing the pond edges, 110 yuan for installing water taps inside the enclosures, 236 yuan for widening the park paths, and 352.60 yuan for building a large thatched pavilion, totaling 6,410.60 yuan. The city government has ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate the funds, and construction is expected to begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Rampant Robberies in Western Shanghai: Attorney Li Mian's Business Card Repels Robbers - Qiu Weigou and Jiang Fuquan Commit Numerous Crimes - Police Investigation Reveals a Total of Eleven Robberies <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Li Mian, the former presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court and now a lawyer, was riding in a chartered car late at night on the 11th of this month, passing the intersection of Xinzha Road and Xiaoshadu Road when he was suddenly confronted by several robbers who ordered the car to stop, intending to rob him. Li, mistaking them for a police search party, took out his business card, stating that he was a lawyer with a formal profession and asking to be excused from inspection. The robbers, seeing the card, did not rob him and turned away. Police officers spotted them and arrested two robbers on the spot: Qiu Weigou from Haimen and Jiang Chenquan, a local. A fake pistol, a knife, and twenty-two pawn tickets were seized and taken to the police station before being sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention the next morning. Details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Liu Ronggen, the Chinese detective from the Jingshou Temple Police Station handling the case, investigated and found that the two defendants specialized in roadside robberies in the western Shanghai area. Recently, as the weather has become cooler, the western district has become desolate. At midnight, when pedestrians are scarce, these men take advantage of this opportunity to lie in wait and rob lone pedestrians. It has been determined that Qiu and Jiang committed more than eleven roadside robberies from December 8th of last year until their arrest. The robberies all occurred between 9:00 and 10:00 PM, including: (1) 109 yuan robbed from Huang Keqi on Xinzha Jiaozhou Road; (2) 90 yuan robbed from Tao A'da on Jessfield Road; (3) 157 yuan robbed from Zhu Fupei on Yuyuan Road; (4) 230 yuan robbed from Jin Houcheng on Avenue Road; (5) a watch worth 65 yuan robbed from an unknown person on Jiaozhou Road; (6) an unclaimed watch worth 40 yuan found on Route Dufour; (7) 10 yuan from an unclaimed person on Hart Road; (8) 60 yuan from an unclaimed person on Jiaozhou Road; (9) 145 yuan from an unclaimed person on Jessfield Road; (10) 29 yuan robbed from Mao Xuanchun on Jessfield Road; (11) 60 yuan robbed from an unclaimed person on Jiaozhou Road. Detective Liu took the two defendants to the pawnshops to recover some of the stolen goods and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Court for further questioning yesterday morning. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that during the adjournment, the police had discovered that the two defendants had committed more than ten cases, the circumstances were complicated, and there were many witnesses. Therefore, there was not enough time for questioning this morning, and he requested an adjournment for a special hearing. Judge Xue Lanru ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending further proceedings on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e160">City Public Security Bureau: Secret Arrest of Four Communists on Orders - Xie Zuoyu and Three Others Arrested at No. 45 Continental New Village - Xie Holds Master's Degrees from Harvard and Cornell Universities, Chen is a College Student - Lawyers Argue Over Evidence During Transfer to High Court Branch - Police Lawyer Believes Xie and Others Have No Counter-Revolutionary Suspicions and Should Be Released <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>—Result: Adjournment Pending Submission of Conclusive Evidence by the City Public Security Bureau; Xie and Others Released on Bail Pending Trial—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Supervisory Department recently received a secret order stating that communists were hiding at No. 45 Continental New Village, Shikota Road in northern Shanghai. The department investigated and determined that Continental New Village was located on an extraterritorial road. At 10:55 AM, they coordinated with detectives from the Fifth District Police Station and rushed to make the arrests. At that time, two Indian police officers from the Wayside Road Police Station were patrolling the area. Believing that the area was under the jurisdiction of the concession, they reported the matter to the police station via telephone. The police station immediately ordered Chinese detective Tan Jinhai and foreign detective Witte to go and prevent unilateral arrest. Together, they arrested four people inside the house: Chen Yuxiu and Xie Xinming from Guangdong, Xie Zuoyu, and Xu Jian from Suzhou. Books and manuscripts were seized and taken back to the police station. It was discovered that Chen and others were graduates of Soochow University, while Xie Zuoyu held master's degrees from Harvard and Cornell Universities in the United States. He had been doing business in Southeast Asia and had recently arrived in Shanghai less than two months ago. He was temporarily detained. Yesterday afternoon, they were transferred to the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Zhou Han opened the court for investigation. Police representatives lawyers Li Zhishan and Gan Jingxian, and James K.F. Chang the legal advisor to the Public Security Bureau, were also present in court. First, Police Lawyer Li stated that the police had found that the four defendants had no criminal suspicion. The "kerosene" books that the Public Security Bureau considered evidence were also deemed to have no counter-revolutionary content. Therefore, he requested that the Public Security Bureau provide sufficient evidence before agreeing to the transfer. Otherwise, he requested that the defendants be released on bail, as the police had originally intended to release the defendants. When questioned, the defendants all denied joining any party or organization. Chen Ming, a supervisor from the City Public Security Bureau, stated that this was a secret order and that the defendants were important figures in the Territory Guarantee League in the French Concession, which was a communist organization. Lawyer James K.F. Chang immediately stated that the case was of great importance and requested permission to transfer the defendants. Police Lawyer Li Zhishan immediately responded that the Public Security Bureau had not provided sufficient evidence and could not conclusively prove that the defendants were communists, only stating that it was a secret order. Such baseless accusations and arrests violated the legal protection of the people and should be noted by the court. Lawyer James K.F. Chang then requested the court to adjourn the case for one week to allow the Public Security Bureau to collect evidence and submit it. Lawyer Li Zhishan added that the police believed that the defendants had no counter-revolutionary suspicion and had wanted to release them at the time of the arrest. As a precautionary measure, they were temporarily detained. Now that the Public Security Bureau was requesting an adjournment, it was still uncertain whether they would be able to present conclusive evidence in the future. To avoid the imprisonment of innocent people and maintain the people's right to protection, he requested that the defendants be released on bail. Lawyer James K.F. Chang opposed this request. Judge Zhou then ruled that the case be adjourned for further hearing, and the four defendants were released on bail of 500 yuan each. Hearing this, Lawyer James K.F. Chang made a statement regarding the bail, stating that the circumstances of the case were extremely serious. If the defendants were only required to pay 500 yuan bail and were to escape in the future, who would be responsible? He requested the court to consider this. Judge Zhou declared that the Public Security Bureau did not have sufficient evidence today. After considering the case, the court decided to release the defendants on bail. The purpose of bail was to prevent escape. If they were to escape, the guarantor would be held responsible. Since the evidence was insufficient today, the 500 yuan bail was deemed appropriate. As for what would happen in the future, it could not be predicted. Therefore, the court believed there was nothing inappropriate. After finishing his statement, he adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e161">British Mrs. Hartley: Sentenced to Hang for Murdering Her Lover <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mrs. Hartley, a British woman of Russian descent, was sentenced to hang by British Acting Judge Jones the other day for murdering her lover, Youngers. The execution will be carried out once it is approved by the British Minister to China. According to the law, the woman still has the right to appeal, but since she is penniless, it is unlikely that she will be able to appeal. Another glimmer of hope is a pardon or reduction of sentence from the British Minister. However, given the circumstances of the case, the hope of a pardon is slim. If the sentence is carried out, it would be unprecedented for a British woman residing in the Far East to be executed. Therefore, the case has attracted much attention from foreigners during the repeated hearings, and the visitor's gallery has always been full. After the interrogation was completed the other afternoon, the twelve jurors retired to the secret chamber for an hour and a quarter before returning to court and declaring the defendant guilty but requesting the court to show mercy. Judge Jones then declared the murder charge established and sentenced the defendant to death by hanging according to law. This case occurred on the evening of August 16th at No. 17, Lane 166, Mao Hai Road. The two had been living together for less than a month. Neighbors saw the woman stabbing Youngers and reported it to the police, who broke into the house and found Youngers lying in a pool of blood, already dead. His neck had been stabbed with a kitchen knife, penetrating more than five inches. The woman was lying in the inner room, disheveled and drunk. She was taken back to the police station and sent to the British Concession Court for interrogation, and the verdict was reached the other day. The woman was a middle-aged widow. Nine years ago, she became acquainted with Youngers, a British man who had worked as a shipowner. However, their relationship was marked by periods of intense affection and periods of conflict and separation. They lived together several times, drifting in and out of each other's lives like duckweed on water. Recently, she had fallen into prostitution and was rescued by a foreign relief organization. She then rekindled her old romance with Youngers, but tragically, it ended in violence.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Cricket Gambling Den Cracked Down in Nanshi: Thirty-One Gamblers and the Ring Leader Arrested <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Gambling has always been rampant in Shanghai. Since the authorities in the Chinese and foreign concessions have strictly prohibited it, it has recently been trending towards a complete stop. However, some gamblers, who view gambling as their profession, have suddenly lost their source of income, as if their lifeline has been cut off. As a result, they have had to outwardly comply with the law while secretly seeking other ways out. Recently, with the arrival of late autumn, they had the audacity to come up with a new idea: they gathered a large number of people and set up a cricket fighting gambling den at No. 1 Heping Lane, Jiumu Di, in the city. The person in charge was named Zhu Futai. Every day, the gambling den was filled with customers, and the stakes were quite high. The Police Brigade and the Independent Squadron had repeatedly tried to raid the den without success. It was not until the other night that the head of the First Sub-station of the Second District finally cracked down on the den. Zhu Futai, the ring leader, and thirty-one gamblers, including Zhang Yougen, were arrested on the spot, along with a large number of the unfortunate crickets. They were all taken to the station and sent to the judicial department for review.</p>

<p>Shao Wenbin, a professional Tan Huang singer nicknamed "Ma Fu A'liu," gave up his career and opened a large flower gambling factory, which caused him to become enemies with others. On the evening of July 28th of this year, at 8:00 PM, he was shot and killed in front of his door at No. 210 Huage Nie Road in the French Concession. On the 14th of last month, Detective Chief Jin Jiulin and Detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin of the French Police Department arrested Zhang Bingrong, a native of Ningbo, a suspect in this case, at No. 68 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. They sent him to the Second Special District District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution against him for premeditated murder. Judge Xiong Hui repeatedly opened the court for interrogation. Zhang confessed that Wang Shilong had a grudge against the deceased and hired him and others to assassinate him. The court ordered an adjournment for further questioning. Details of this case have been previously reported. Yesterday, Judge Xiong opened the court again for further hearing. The defendant's confession was the same as previously reported and will not be repeated here. The court appointed Xu Yannian as his defense lawyer. The court declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing. The defendant was remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Fire Leads to Discovery of Large-Scale Heroin Manufacturing Operation - Japanese National Nagasawa Sentenced to One Month's Imprisonment by Japanese Consulate - Chinese National Xiao Zhifen's Court Hearing Adjourned for Investigation Yesterday <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The premises at No. 1 Huanglu Road, rented by Japanese national Nagasawa (also known as Nagasawa), caught fire accidentally at 11:35 PM on August 24th. When the Chinese and foreign detectives from the Wayside Road Police Station and the firefighters rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm, a man jumped from a window and fell unconscious at the main entrance. When questioned, he was unable to speak and was wearing Japanese clothing, so he was identified as Japanese. He was hired a car and sent to Fumin Hospital. It was later learned that he was a Cantonese man named Liang Di, who was then transferred to the police station hospital for treatment. After the fire was extinguished, a large quantity of morphine powder for manufacturing heroin and a large pot of unfinished heroin material, as well as chemical machinery and other items, were found inside the premises. The police then discovered that the premises were a large-scale heroin manufacturing operation, established by the Japanese national Nagasawa. He was arrested and sent to the Japanese consulate for legal punishment. The Cantonese man Liang Di remained in a coma in the hospital, refusing to speak. The police were unable to determine who had hired him and could only file a report under the name Liang Di, age and surname unknown. They submitted the case to the First Special District Court, pending his recovery for questioning. It was not until the other day that he suddenly spoke, claiming that he was from Chaozhou, named Xiao Zhifen, only seventeen years old, and worked as a general affairs officer for a Japanese man at the premises. He had recently come to Shanghai from his hometown and did not know anything else. Yesterday morning, the police corrected his name and sent him to the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that the owner of the premises, Japanese national Nagasawa (i.e., Nagasawa), had been sentenced to one month's imprisonment by the Japanese consulate. He was present in court to testify. He presented the previously seized evidence, heroin, a pot of unfinished raw materials, and photographs of various machines for inspection. He stated that the material had been chemically tested by a Public Works Department doctor and confirmed to be the chemical juice for manufacturing heroin. The defendant's claim of living downstairs was false. Firefighters could testify that he had jumped from upstairs. They were also present in court. According to Nagasawa's testimony, he was a car dealer. He rented the premises in October of last year. He lived downstairs with his wife and two Chinese men and one Chinese woman, who were all servants. The upstairs was sublet to a Cantonese man named Li. The heroin materials and other items seized were all owned by the man surnamed Li, and the defendant was hired by him and was not his general affairs officer. Then, Li Defu, a Korean firefighter, testified that the defendant jumped from the balcony upstairs, fell unconscious to the ground, and was helped up by him. He was unable to speak at that time, so he was taken to the hospital by car. When questioned, the defendant spoke Chaozhou dialect, and there was no translator. The police lawyer asked him to speak some Shanghainese, and he replied that he came to Shanghai from Chaozhou only two months ago and worked as a general affairs officer for a Japanese man at the premises. He lived downstairs, and the upstairs was occupied by a Chinese man named Wang Hongsheng. He did not know what the latter was doing. When the fire broke out, he was sleeping soundly downstairs, woke up in alarm, and fell to the ground while escaping. The court asked if the Japanese man at his house was Nagasawa. After observing him, he said it was not him. His other testimony was evasive. Nagasawa stated that there was no other Japanese man at his place. His testimony was inaccurate, and there was no Chinese man named Wang Hongsheng. The police lawyer Zhang stated that the premises were indeed a large-scale heroin manufacturing operation. Another Cantonese man was still at large. Who established the organization was important to international relations. He requested another extension to investigate whether the defendant was the general affairs officer at the premises or an assistant in the organization. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered that the case be adjourned for further review. The next time the court convened, the police were instructed to bring a Chaozhou translator to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Meeting of the Cotton Traders Association - Telegram to Minister Song Requesting Assistance <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, the Shanghai Cotton Traders Association held its 14th Executive Committee meeting. More than ten people attended, including Zhou Kai, Tang Qixian, Zhou Chunbo, Zhu Jinsheng, Zhou Bocun, Yang Yanbo, and Wu Jiliu. Ding Yutian was elected temporary chairman. The meeting was conducted according to protocol. The recording report was abbreviated. Discussion and resolutions: (1) Cotton procurement case. Resolution: Send letters to cotton procurement offices in Hankou and Shashi, requesting that the cotton be pure to preserve the industry's reputation. Passed. (2) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's warehouse proposed rent starting after half a month for cotton imported from Shashi. Resolution: Send a letter to the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting that cotton imported from Shashi be treated the same as cotton from Hankou. Passed. (3) Cotton loan case. Resolution: Send a telegram to Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance requesting that he use stopgap and fundamental measures to help the cotton industry, traders, and farmers. Passed. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 PM. The telegram to Minister Song is recorded below. To Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: Since the cotton and wheat loan was finalized, the government has established the National Economic Commission, with you, Minister, being specially selected to oversee its functions. You are using a unified system to restore rural areas, regulate food, silk, tea, cotton, and mining to resist foreign economic aggression and to take overall planning into account, for the benefit of the whole country. Recently, you have also initiated the Unified Cotton Industry Committee, recruiting specialized personnel to create a sound organization. Looking at the declaration, from expanding cotton fields, improving planting, increasing textiles, and regulating labor and capital, everything is planned and detailed, and thoroughly considered. All of us in the cotton industry admire you greatly. In every country, social reforms are preceded by hardship, and only then can we achieve lasting benefits. This is a necessary path. If the medicine does not cause dizziness, the illness will not be cured. The people of the country also know that without the determination to be firm and patient and to work hard with the government, it will not be possible to lay a foundation that will last for centuries. However, since the national crisis, the market has been depressed, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the people's suffering is indescribable. Just in the cotton industry alone, with the dumping of foreign goods and the general economic recession, the national cotton industry has already plummeted. When news of the arrival of American cotton came, prices fell sharply again. The average cotton trader and farmer are aware that the government's cotton and wheat loan has a far-reaching plan for the national economy. However, the current impact has put the cotton traders and farmers at risk of collapse. Furthermore, when national cotton is harvested, American cotton is arriving. Since the government has announced that American cotton will not be sold to Japan, then all American cotton and national cotton must be consumed in the domestic market. Supply exceeds demand, and prices will inevitably fall. It can be concluded that production will increase daily, while demand will decrease. At the same time, foreign goods continue to be dumped. The future situation may be even worse than it is today. If the government does not take measures to assist in advance, the exhausted cotton traders and farmers will not be able to survive. Abandoning the root and pursuing the branch is a poor strategy. It seems that both stopgap and fundamental measures should be implemented. It is believed that there are approximately two aspects to the stopgap measures: (1) Stabilize market prices. Currently, as cotton prices are declining, not only are traders suffering losses, but also planters will not be able to support themselves. The government should investigate the situation and find ways to stabilize cotton market prices to reduce losses for both traders and farmers and to maintain the status quo. (2) Improve dyeing and weaving. Domestically produced cotton fabrics, especially floral-labeled cloth, are the most sold. Since the European War, Japan has shipped more than 100 million units of floral-labeled cloth to our country each year. The amount shipped by European and American countries is also not small. In the past two years, although the import of Japanese goods has decreased, the import of Russian goods has increased sharply. The actual outflow of money remains the same. If our country's cotton industry does not improve dyeing and weaving, but relies solely on increasing spindles and expanding native cloth looms, it may lead to a tragic situation of product stagnation and textile factory shutdowns. The plan for now is to first investigate the domestic sales of floral-labeled cloth and native cloth, and immediately promote floral-labeled cloth dyeing and weaving factories. If the resources are insufficient, the government should provide subsidies to ensure that the products meet the needs and do not stagnate. The government should take the lead above, and the people should create and manufacture below. In this way, loopholes can be plugged, and domestic products can circulate. By addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, both the national economy and people's livelihood will benefit. We respectfully submit this telegram for your review and approval for implementation. This will be fortunate for the country and fortunate for the cotton industry. Shanghai Cotton Traders Association kowtows, Hao.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Traveling Exhibition Group, led by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Citizens National Products Promotion Association, and the China National Products Maintenance Association, in compliance with the order of the Ministry of Industry, held a National Products Mobile Exhibition in various provinces, cities, and counties. They traveled to Bengbu to participate in the Bengbu National Products Exhibition to expand publicity and promote national products. The group consisted of 76 well-known national product factories and over 200 staff members, led by Jin Weixuan, the chief director of the exhibition group, Xu Qiaoqi, Chen Guoming, Zhu Juewu, and Xu Yao. They departed on the special express night train on the 17th. It is now known that the group telegraphed that they will arrive in Bengbu at 4 PM tomorrow. They will be warmly welcomed by all sectors of the party, government, military, police, commerce, and education, and a parade will be held throughout the city. The opening ceremony is scheduled for the 22nd. Considering that traveling to other provinces for promotional work is easy to encounter difficulties, the association has publicly elected executive committee members Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Xu Jianruo, Zhang Dezhai, exhibition group director Xu Yunhui, and secretary Huang Mengtu to go to Bengbu to preside over the opening ceremony and entertain guests from all walks of life. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed Liu, the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Wang, the director of the Bengbu Military and Police Supervision Office, and He, the director of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau, requesting strict protection and maintenance of national products. Furthermore, Lin Kanghou, the chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, separately wrote to the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce and business leaders, requesting their assistance in carrying out the grand event. The original telegram from the association is recorded below (abbreviations omitted): Our association, in accordance with the Central Government's instructions on the seven-item grassroots movement and the Ministry of Industry's instructions to hold national product exhibitions in various provinces and cities, and in response to the invitation from the Bengbu Public Education Center's National Products Promotion Committee, is leading the Shanghai National Products Traveling Exhibition Group to participate in the Bengbu National Products Exhibition, scheduled to open on the 22nd of this month for a period of two weeks, to promote the opportunity for the people of Bengbu to recognize national products and to expand the sales channels for national product factories, focusing on the power to save the country and avenge humiliation. In addition to reporting to the Shanghai Municipal Government for record, and the Ministry of Railways issuing transportation reduction certificates, and actively preparing for the departure on schedule, we are concerned that Bengbu is far from Shanghai, and we are afraid that we will be unfamiliar with the people and the place, and work will be inconvenient. Therefore, we especially telegraph to ask you to understand the purpose of promoting national products and promptly order the military and police agencies in Bengbu to provide practical protection and assistance in carrying out the national product movement. We deeply appreciate and look forward to your public sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Yi Peiji Discusses the Case of Ancient Artifacts from the Palace Museum: Forced to Counter-Sue; Handover of Palace Museum Affairs Completed <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Following the counter-suit filed by former Palace Museum Director Yi Peiji, the general public has paid close attention. Yesterday, a person close to Yi visited him at the French-operated Qiyi Hospital. The following is a record of the conversation: Q: What brings you to Shanghai? A: I have suffered from diabetes for several years, and it has recently worsened, so I came to Shanghai for treatment. Also, Cui Zhenhua and Zou Lie colluded to frame me, and I also want to come south to appeal. Q: The Palace Museum lawsuit has been going on for months, why haven't you appeared in court? A: This matter came to light on May 1st of this year. On that day, the Supreme Procuratorate sent prosecutor Zhu Shusheng to Beijing to interrogate me. I personally appeared in court for questioning, which lasted for four hours. Afterwards, Zhu repeatedly summoned Li Zongtong and others for questioning. Each time, they had to go to the Beijing District Court, which is documented. How can you say I didn't appear in court? Upon discovering the telegram of Zou Lie's illegal arrest, there were also rumors of imprisoning us and handing us over to Puyi (because the ancient artifacts of the Palace Museum, along with the ancestral tablet of Qing Taizu and portraits of Puyi's ancestors, were all being transported. This was tantamount to capturing Puyi, and he hated me to the core). Moreover, since the legal power was in the hands of the other party, if I surrendered myself, I would not only be left to the enemy, but also be subjected to illegal imprisonment. As an old and sickly man, how could I endure such suffering in the scorching heat of summer? I feared that by the time I was declared innocent, I would have already died in prison. The reason I didn't appear in court afterwards is all due to these kinds of hardships. Q: Then why didn't you counter-sue? A: There were also difficulties. Puyi and I have been friends for over ten years, and we were also old members of the Republican Party. If we were to sue each other, it would give others something to criticize. The Supreme Court judge openly bribed and exposed corruption, which would affect the country's image. Therefore, I endured humiliation and waited for the other party to come to their senses. This is why I didn't want to file a counter-suit hastily. Q: What was the handover situation like? A: The Beijing Palace Museum's general affairs office, such as general affairs accounting, security guards, and document departments, the secretariat's documents and files, have all been handed over clearly. The receiving committee members have all stamped and signed. The important artifacts have been transported to Shanghai and are being inventoried. Q: Are there any problems during the inventory? A: I have heard that the other party has plans to create incidents during the inventory of artifacts, use news tactics, and promote social gossip to use as weapons in the lawsuit. Everyone knows that the Palace Museum has no corruption. Even if some of the boxes are overturned when they are opened, it is understandable during the hectic rush of transportation. Moreover, the packing and custodian staff are directly responsible, and all of them are still on duty. There is no way to follow Zheng Lie's method of investigating them.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Knitted Goods Shipped to Hangzhou for Sale Must Have Proof from the National Products Association Because Non-Domestic Raw Materials are Being Used to Counterfeit Brands for Dumping <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association recently received a letter from the Hangzhou Knitted Goods Industry Association, stating: Dear Sirs, Upon investigation, since the September 18th Incident, all Japanese goods have been dumped at reduced prices as part of Japan's economic aggression. Some unscrupulous merchants, seeking only profit, disregard the national interest, resulting in the daily promotion of national products by the people, while customs records show that the import of Japanese goods has increased daily. National product manufacturers have made no progress, and the consequences of this situation are unbearable. To correct this, a fundamental solution is needed. According to reports, ten factories in Shanghai, including Gongzu, Sanyang, Jiuyi, Dingxin, Yutai, Junchang, Yingzhou, Yongyuan, Yixing, and Tonghe, are using inferior Japanese Limabrand yarn to replace it with domestic Zhongsha yarn. As a result, the finished products are sold to the interior as national products, which in reality means that inferior goods are occupying the market and defeating genuine national products. The association's temporary members' meeting has resolved that all such goods will be refused entry in the future. All goods shipped from Shanghai to Hangzhou by the industry must have proof from the China National Products Maintenance Association, along with the unified tax form, in order to be sold in the market, thereby maintaining national products and preventing genuine domestic manufacturers from being driven to ruin. We are writing to your association to ask you to investigate and handle this matter, and to provide a list of the factory brands in Shanghai that are confirmed to be using domestic raw materials, so that we can inform our colleagues. Thank you for your cooperation. Upon receiving this letter, the association has investigated and implemented the matter cautiously.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau Abolished; Business Handled by the General Bureau; Name Abolished by Year-End <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The issue of the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau being transferred to the Postal General Bureau was submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Central Political Committee for decision. The principle was to be implemented by the Ministry. However, the review of the relevant laws and regulations required time. In order to conserve and tighten resources, the Ministry ordered the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau to abolish the Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau, with business handled by the General Bureau. The name will be abolished by the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e172">City Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Public Works Department to Correct the Current Policy of the Electricity Company: Using the Employer System to Control Laborers; Perpetual Harmony Cannot Be Expected <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Public Works Department yesterday: Dear Sirs, Since the workers of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's new factory went on strike due to the company's continuous dismissals and refusal to pay pensions, the company has locked the factory gates and refused workers entry, leading to an escalation of the turmoil. The standoff has lasted for more than twenty days. It is understood that labor strikes are a common phenomenon after the development of mechanical industry. However, the solution is nothing more than equal negotiations between labor and management, or impartial mediation by a third party. This is not only the case in advanced industrial countries, but also in Shanghai's Chinese-owned factories when they encounter labor strikes. The Electric Power Company, since it operates within China, cannot disregard this common practice. However, due to its foreign nationality, the company is unwilling to adopt negotiation or mediation procedures, but purely wants to use its employer system to control laborers and force them to submit, as if the methods used by civilized countries to resolve labor strikes are not applicable in the Far East. This kind of anachronistic mentality, even if the policy is effective for a time, cannot be expected to achieve perpetual harmony. Our association hopes that your bureau can use its supervisory position to admonish and correct the current policy of the company.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Pilot License Dispute: Navigation Association Submits Report on the Process to the Ministry <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The pilots Wang Shaoqing, Wang Maoqing, Fu Xietang, Chen Haishan, Xiang Nengxing, and Zhu Jingan of the Minsheng Industrial Company's three ships, Min Gui, Min Xian, and Min Kang, applied for long-term practice certificates in accordance with regulations, but were obstructed by the Songhu Pilot Association. After repeated unsuccessful negotiations, the Shanghai Navigation Industry Association submitted a report to the Ministry of Communications yesterday: Regarding the submission of a request to the Ministry of the Navy to order the Songhu Pilot Association to submit the conditions for revising the regulations, so that they can be forwarded for understanding. Previously, the association received a telegram requesting immediate assistance because the Songhu Pilot Association was obstructing the transfer of certificates to the long-term pilots Wang Shaoqing and others employed by member Minsheng Industrial Company. The Ministry replied with No. 2075, approving the Navy's consultation on the matter of pilot Wang Shaoqing and others applying for licenses. It was found that the Pilot Training Institute had already issued these certificates and handed them over to the Songhu Pilot Association for forwarding. The institute has stated that due to the business relationship of Wang Shaoqing and others, the association must revise the regulations and the association and the pilots should negotiate on their own. The association should immediately order the completion of the procedures in accordance with regulations and promptly obtain the certificates. This was duly noted, and Minsheng Company was notified to forward it to the pilots. The company replied that the Ministry's approval was noted. The certificates of Wang Shaoqing and others have been issued by the Training Institute, which proves that the procedures have been completed. The fact that the Pilot Association has not followed through also proves that it intends to make things difficult. Other Chinese companies, such as China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, etc., and foreign companies, such as Taikoo, Jardine, and Xiangtai, etc., all have their long-term pilots' certificates issued by the Training Institute and forwarded by the association, but there has never been a precedent for revising the regulations. This is the first point. Also, according to the association's articles of association submitted to the Navy for record, there is no provision that any member must revise the regulations. This is the second point. The so-called revising the regulations has no precedent and no basis in the articles of association. It is a superfluous issue and has other intentions, which can be ignored. However, with the company's peace of mind as the premise, the pilots were ordered to compromise and inquire reluctantly. Unexpectedly, the association did not sincerely inform them, so the conditions were unknown and could not be revised. This is regrettable. The pilot association's regulations have all been submitted to the Navy for record, so the conditions that should be revised must also be submitted to the Ministry for record, in order to be solemn and for public use. The Navy should be asked to consult each item and indicate them, so that they can be negotiated. If they have not been submitted for record, the Navy should be asked to order them to report. It should be asked that the association forward the detailed conditions for revising the regulations with pilots Wang Shaoqing and others to the Navy for consultation with the Ministry of Communications, which will order the association to inform the association and inform the pilots for consideration and decision. The association replied that the request was pertinent and reasonable, and it should be forwarded accordingly, requesting approval and consultation for a speedy resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Seventh District Office of Wusong Investigates Case of Trafficked Women <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xiaoxing and Li Faping, patrol officers from the 9th outpost of the 7th District of the Wusong Branch Security Bureau, found two suspicious-looking individuals, a man and a woman named Lu Dabao, at the train station yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. They were immediately taken to the district office and interrogated by District Chief Gong. Lu Dabao claimed to be 19 years old, from Yancheng, and had been in Shanghai for four years, working at the Shunxing Factory in Caojiadu. Zhao Xiaoying introduced her to the job. On the 8th of this month, Xiaoying told her not to work at the factory and that her brother would introduce her to a job in Wusong. On the morning of the 9th, she went to a hotel with Zhao Guigang. The next day, they stayed at his friend's house. Then they took a train to Wusong and stayed at his sister's house in Taixing Temple. Today, he ordered her to go to Jiangbei with the intention of marrying her, but she was unwilling because she had been deceived by him. Zhao Guigang confessed that he was 26 years old, from Taizhou, and currently unemployed. He had known Lu Dabao for more than a month. The previous week, some women mentioned that a young woman was unemployed and asked him to introduce her to a job in Wusong. He agreed and took her out. That day, he had her stay in a hotel, while he stayed in Xiaobeimen. The next day, they went to Wusong and stayed at the house of a person named Shi in Taixing Temple for seven days. Because they could not get a job at the Wing On Textile Factory, he intended to send her back to Caojiadu today. District Chief Gong considered this case to involve the trafficking of women from respectable families and ordered that the man and woman be transferred to the General Bureau for punishment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tax Collection Office issued a notice yesterday regarding the strict prohibition of impersonation: It is known that the practice of impersonating and using one permit for multiple transactions has always been prohibited. If such misconduct is discovered, it will be punished according to the regulations to deter others from following suit. It is known that most of the brokers in various districts of the city and county conduct legitimate transactions with registered names and license numbers, but there are also quite a few who impersonate and use one permit for multiple transactions. Such arbitrary and irregular conduct is disrupting the tax regulations and violating the prohibitions. The office should punish the offenders according to their names, but out of consideration that the brokers may not be aware of the violations of the tax regulations, they must be warned again and again. Therefore, a notice is hereby issued to all brokers that impersonation and multiple use of permits are prohibited. They should come to the office to pay taxes and obtain permits as soon as possible, and not wait and see, lest they be investigated and bring trouble upon themselves. After this notice, if there are any more of the above-mentioned misconducts, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>The Northern Line (i.e., the Shanghai to Qingdao route) has always been operated by Japanese ships, which are better than both Chinese and British ships. The reason is that the ships are well-equipped and very fast, so they are popular with passengers. In order to maintain navigation rights and for the convenience of passengers, the China Merchants Bureau leased the Puan vessel from the Ministry of the Navy in early summer of this year. For several months, passengers have found it convenient and business has been good. The bureau originally intended to stop the service in the autumn, but due to the requests of merchants in the port, it is continuing to operate. The British company Taikoo Steamship Company has several vessels calling at the port, but because they are mostly cargo ships, they are not suitable for passengers. In order to facilitate passengers, it is reported that the Shengjing vessel on the Northern Line will now stop at Weihaiwei, in addition to Qingdao and Yantai, starting tomorrow, the 21st. Passengers and cargo to Qingdao from Shanghai will not be delayed, and the schedule for Yantai and Tianjin will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>There are forty or fifty houses in Peifuli, Rue du Consulat General, in the French Concession. The landlord has always been Peifu Company. Since the company transferred the lease management rights to the Teepock Real Estate Department in April last year, the department issued a notice to the tenants in September of this year, requiring all to sign new leases. The tenants believe that there has never been such a procedure since they rented the houses, and since the real estate department took over, all the tenants have paid rent and there has been no arrears. It is difficult to accept the new leases with their harsh conditions. Therefore, they jointly wrote to the real estate department to express their unanimous opposition. Unexpectedly, the landlord ignored them and filed a request for mediation in court on the grounds of rent arrears. The tenants were all terrified upon receiving the summons. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, they held a mass meeting of all the tenants at the Fourth District Branch of the Citizens' Union to discuss countermeasures. Xu Mianqing was publicly elected as the chairman, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Xu Mianqing, Wang Zhongxiang, Fang Junjie, Yan Dingan, Lu Ruifu, Hu Nihuwan, and others were appointed as preparatory members to organize the Peifuli Branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Citizens' Union. (2) A founding meeting will be held on a scheduled date, and the meeting will be reported to the higher authorities for guidance. (3) When the court mediates, all the tenants will appear in court to state the reasons and provide evidence from savings books and letters that the landlord deliberately refused to collect rent. (4) Gu Jirong Law Firm will be hired as legal counsel. The meeting was adjourned after the discussions.</p>

Next, Mr. Xie Xiasun of China stated that according to the Chinese Continued Sutra Collection, international chess is the ancient Chinese chess, which was increased by Prime Minister Niu Sengru of the Tang Dynasty, with the addition of two cannons. He proposed to add Western-style Chinese chess to the association, with Mr. Ge Linrui, a Danish national and chief professor of Chinese at the Public Works Department, providing public guidance. Because Mr. Ge has written many Chinese chess manuals, translated into Western languages, he is also the most enthusiastic comrade in the chess world. He intends to train a team in the shortest possible time, ready to go for a Chinese-Western international chess final. At that time, it can increase the meeting affairs, and the momentum should be like thunder. Next, De Aiwen of Russia, Yi Lifen of the United States, Gan Yaolei of France, and others made new suggestions for expanding the meeting. It was also heard that before the meeting that night, Xie Xiasun of China and Danai Pan of Portugal had a Sino-Portuguese international friendship match, which lasted for a long time. Later, Mr. Danai was unable to continue due to numbness in his right hand and exhaustion, and as a result, China won.</p>

The content is completely inconsistent with the facts. I came to Shanghai this spring to study and there is no truth to the fact that I was engaged to the dancer or that I sent her living expenses monthly. Although the dancer once seduced me, I broke off contact with her early because of my eagerness to study. Furthermore, the newspaper's claim that my father owns various businesses and has family property of five or six hundred thousand yuan is also untrue. It is obvious that the other party is coveting my property and deliberately exaggerating in order to achieve their purpose of extortion. It is also claimed that I do not stay at home and often go to dance halls and singing stages, which is slanderous of my reputation and credit. Please correct the report. Respectfully submitted to the Chief Editor of the Shen Bao, Attorney Yin Shijie, October 19th.</p>

<p>▲ Endless Troubles for Shanghai Team</p>
<p>Guangdong's Five Forwards Extremely Active</p>
<p>Shanghai, facing headwind, held its ground. Guangdong's five forwards, taking advantage of the wind, actively attacked. Center forward Li Hongqing, with lightning speed, charged straight into the central army tent. Li Jiangshan was in a hurry to rescue, Li Chuanqiu and Ye Beihua, Ye Qi, were caught squarely by Zhou, the iron gate. Mai Su and Hu Tianbao surrounded Zhou on all sides, unable to move. He gently pushed the ball out of bounds, forcing a corner kick. It was just five minutes from the kickoff when Yang Shuiyi took the kick. The landing point was excellent. Mai Su caught up with a kick, as fast as a bullet. Jiangshan's back served as a rattan shield. With a bang, it bounced far away and was caught up by Ye Beihua, who kicked it again, but it was still caught by the iron gate. The Shanghai formation was a chaotic mess, killing people and horses. In these fifteen minutes, the Shanghai formation was constantly living in a stormy sea.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Forwards Muster Courage to Probe</p>
<p>Too Hasty, Good Opportunities Repeatedly Missed</p>
<p>While the Shanghai five forwards resisted desperately, they still sought opportunities to attack. Once, Zhong Yongsen got the ball and passed it over the center back line to Li Yichen. Li passed it to Sun Jinshun. Sun's attack missed, and the ball went out of bounds to the left, losing the opportunity. After seventeen minutes, Shanghai was penalized for two more corner kicks. They were picked up to the center of the goal, but were ultimately saved by the efforts of Jiangshan and Li Ning. After nineteen minutes, Liang Shutang was penalized for a foul. Mai Su took the kick, but the ball was too high and went over the net, missing by a few points. Otherwise, Zhou, the iron gate, would have been powerless. After twenty minutes, Chen Jiaqiu dribbled straight in and passed it to Zhong Yongsen. At this time, the Guangdong defense was empty. Anxious to score, he raised his foot to shoot, but used too much force and missed again. After twenty-two minutes, Guangdong's Hu Tianbao passed the ball to Mai Su, who penetrated deep into the abdomen. Fortunately, Li Ning arrived and desperately saved it, but it was still intercepted by Li Hongqing, who attacked again. The iron gate fumbled while catching the ball due to the strong wind, forcing another corner kick. Yang Shuiyi took the kick, and Jiangshan retaliated with a big kick. The ball then flew into the Guangdong formation, and soon flew to the Shanghai side again. The fierce battle was extremely intense.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou, the Iron Gate, in Great Form</p>
<p>Guangdong's Fierce Generals Unable to Cross the Forbidden Zone</p>
<p>After thirty-two minutes, Guangdong used a short-range passing technique to penetrate the abdomen. Hu Tianbao lifted a foot, and Zhou Xianyan made a beautiful dive save. Shanghai launched a major counterattack again. Sun Jinshun bravely killed the enemy. Fortunately, Li Tiansheng killed from mid-air and angled it out of bounds. The two teams fought a chaotic battle. The iron gate was careful, constantly telling Xiao Jiang not to stray too far. By the end of the first half, it was 0-0, with neither side winning. The ball came and went suddenly, making Chen Quxiang's legs suffer, running non-stop was the most difficult task. During the break, Shanghai's leader Yu Hengzhi gave instructions. Guangdong's coaches also gathered their athletes and whispered privately. In the second half, they switched sides. Shanghai was downwind, and Chen Hongguang replaced Chen Jiaqiu.

<p>After the touch, Guangdong still besieged the Shanghai goal. The iron gate blocked left and right, made four dive saves, and caught the ball seven times, so that the Guangdong army could not cross the forbidden zone. The performance was unprecedented. The applause in the whole game was electric and the limelight was extremely great.</p>

<p>After ten minutes, Guangdong brave general Mai Su was injured beside the Shanghai goal and fell to the ground. After being rescued off the field, Zhu Guolun replaced him, and Guangdong's momentum was weakened. Shanghai took the opportunity to rise up. Li Chen led the children straight to the Guangdong side, with the force of pushing mountains and overturning seas, unstoppable. Li Tiansheng, with his extremely rich experience and the cleanest foot, found it difficult to cope with the difficult situation. By the 26th minute, Li Yichen passed the ball to Sun Jinshun. Sun caught up and the Guangdong goalkeeper rushed out to save the ball but failed to catch it, and the ball went lightly into the net, opening the scoring. The whole audience cheered, and the Shanghai team was overjoyed and its momentum was even stronger. Guangdong tried hard to counterattack, but ultimately failed. At 30 minutes, Zhong Yongsen got the ball and sprinted, urgently using a long ball to pass to Wan Xianghua. Wan passed it to Sun Jinshun, the goalkeeper was flustered and hit another ball, making it 2-0. Guangdong's momentum was gone, and it was impossible to recover. By the 37th minute, Li Yichen got another ball. Afterwards, Guangdong averted dangerous goals. In the second half, 3-0, Shanghai won. Shanghai thus won this football championship, and President Lin of the National Government's glorious Jin Ge moved to the Shanghai army to maintain the next conference.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Shanghai is Average in Talent: Guangdong's Failure Lies in the Goalkeeper <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>As for the skills of the two teams, the Guangdong team's connection and passing of the five forwards, and their head</p>
<p>superiority, is indeed not something that the Shanghai team can match. Defender Li Tiansheng, with his commanding presence, is also not to be underestimated. Their weakness lies in the slightly weaker center back line, and the goalkeeper is not good. The goalkeeper cannot even talk about technique. Guangdong's two football mistakes were both due to the goalkeeper. Shanghai's team is average in talent. The five forwards, under the close supervision of the Guangdong army, have an extremely high profile. In particular, Wan Xianghua met Li Tiansheng, which was truly a dose of medicine, unable to move at all. The center and interior defenders are very competent. Sun and Li are both ministers of rescue. Speaking of the iron gate, Zhou's contribution in this game is of course the greatest. The goalkeeping technique has become miraculous, otherwise they would have lost at least three or five goals. The celebration banquet cannot be seated. ▲ Shanghai Team</p>

<p>Nanjing, 19th. The women's tennis championship final was held at 9:00 AM on the 19th. The first singles was Wang Chunjing of Shanxi against Bao Dajing of Sichuan, and the first singles was Wang Chuncang of Shanxi against Li Yupin of Sichuan. As a result, Jin won the first singles 1-0, Jin won the second singles 1-1, and Sichuan forfeited the doubles, and Jin won the tennis championship.</p>
<p>Wang Chunjing (Jin) (6-3 8-6) Bao Dajing (Sichuan)</p>
<p>Wang Chunwei (Jin) (4-6 7-5 6-3) Li Yupin (Sichuan)</p>
<p>Sichuan gave up the doubles</p>
<p>▲ Wang Chunjing Steadily Takes Bao Dajing Shanxi tennis sisters, Wang Chunjing and Chunwei, have shown their prowess since the first two games. Wang Chunjing's net is appropriate, and the long shot is also good. At the beginning of the first singles, he killed three levels, and in the fourth game, Bao Dajing took advantage of the fast ball to turn the game around, making it 3-1. Wang Chunjing saw that the momentum was very fierce, and used the method of attacking from afar to make Master Bao suffer, and won the first set 6-3. In the second set, both sides cheered up, and the Sichuan generals tried to catch up after losing the first set. The battle was quite exciting, from each one to each three. The competition was the most intense. In the next game, Jin Wang won by a long shot, but was soon caught up by the Sichuan generals to a tie. Bao Dajing was very angry, but Jin Wang used the bottom line draw, which was smooth and flawless, and it was ultimately difficult to succeed. At 6-6, Wang Chunjing suddenly rose and won two consecutive games, winning the second set 8-6.</p>
<p>▲ Wang Chunwei Wins Li Yupin with Wisdom In the second singles, Jin Wang Chunwei played against Chuan Li Yupin. At the beginning of the game, the strength of the two armies was balanced. Li was rich in experience, and Wang was beneficial to intelligence. It can be said that they were well-matched. Chuan general served well, and Wang was struggling to parry. Chuan Li took the lead by 6-4 and won the first set. The Shanxi lady was not willing to be outdone. In the second set, she took the lead. Li Yupin was calm and used the art of deceiving the enemy to make Wang run. Wang was young and fat and not good at running, but gradually became spirited and tried his best to save the almost-lost situation, and achieved a singles record of 7-5, which was quite dangerous. The third set was the lifeline of the whole game, which was contested by military strategists. Miss Wang came up with a plan in her mind and won two consecutive games with a slip. Li Yupin saw that the situation was not good, and also used ingenious tactics to return the color. Slippery won one game. Struggling like this for a long time, each did not forcefully kill, but focused on defending. Only Jin Wang never easily let go when the opportunity came. Seizing the opportunity, the third set was won by a score of 6-3, and Shanxi won this women's tennis championship.</p>

<p>The Contest of National Players: Qiu Feihai Wins Against Lin Baohua</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) The men's tennis final was held on the 19th in the morning, with singles and doubles held at the same time starting at 9:00 AM. There were no games in the morning at 9:00, so there were many spectators, no less than three or four thousand people. Before 8:00, the tennis court was already full of people. At every exciting performance, applause erupted, especially the first singles match between Shanghai's Qiu Feihai and Sichuan's Lin Baohua, which was the most eye-catching. Qiu had been defeated by Xu Chengji in Bataan, while Lin had defeated Xu Chengji in the exhibition game on the 18th. Therefore, this game was no less than a contest of national tennis players. Everyone wanted to find out the truth to determine the winner. As a result, Qiu won against Lin by a score of 3-1. The competition in the second singles, Shanghai's Wang Wenzheng against Sichuan's Qian Yaobin, was also quite fierce. As a result, San also won Qian by a score of 3-1. The doubles match between Shanghai's Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang against Sichuan's Zheng Zuju and Li Nan was too different in strength. Zheng Yu won easily with a straight victory of 3 sets. In total, Shanghai won against Sichuan by a score of 3-0 and won the championship. The matches were as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (Shanghai) (5-7 6-0 6-4 6-3) Lin Baohua (Sichuan)</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (Shanghai) (12-10 2-6 8-6 6-1) Qian Yaobin (Sichuan)</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Yu Tianguang (Shanghai) (6-1 6-2 6-4) Zheng Zuju Li Nan (Sichuan)</p>

<p>▲ Momentary Brilliance: In the first set, Qiu served first and immediately won the first game. Lin returned the favor in the same way, tying the score at one apiece. Lin then won two consecutive games, taking a commanding lead of 3-1. Qiu quickly caught up, winning his serve, but Lin won two more games with a slice, leading 5-3. Qiu refused to be outdone, winning back two games, tying the score at 5-5. Qiu's serve failed, putting him at a disadvantage at 5-6. In the next game, Qiu gave away the first set with three errors.</p>
<p>▲ Ultimately Extraordinary: Starting the second set, Qiu was determined and launched a vigorous counterattack. As expected, everything went smoothly, with overwhelming momentum. Although Lin tried his best to resist, he was ultimately ineffective, losing game after game, with Qiu winning five straight. In the final game, Lin made a kill shot, but Qiu still won the set with a clean sweep.</p>
<p>▲ Coming from Behind: After a crushing defeat in the previous set, Lin knew that he couldn't win by force alone. So, at the beginning of the third set, he applied great pressure, feinting attacks to the east and west, and winning two consecutive games with slices.</p>
<p>Seeing the fierce momentum, Qiu realized that only a clever approach would work. As expected, he achieved initial success and quick victory, also using slices to retaliate and tying the score at 2-2. Afterwards, both players lost their serves until they reached a 4-4 tie. In the ninth game, Qiu's serve unexpectedly turned the tide and he won, leading 5-4. The next game was a matter of life and death, with each player carefully defending. But Lin's serve was more reliable, giving him an absolute advantage at 40-15. However, Qiu also knew the importance of this game and refused to give up easily, resolutely fighting back. Lin Baohua, a tennis player from Sichuan,</p>
<p>tied the score and then tied it several more times. Lin ultimately failed again with a self-inflicted error. Qiu then came from behind to win with a score of two sets to one, showing his prowess.</p>
<p>▲ Final Victory: After a short break, the battle resumed. By this time, both players were exhausted. Lin, having lost two sets in a row, showed signs of anxiety and made hurried movements, leading to numerous errors. Qiu, on the other hand, remained unusually calm and composed, revealing nothing. Although his calf muscles cramped up at one point, he continued to advance bravely and attack. At the beginning of the set, Qiu took a commanding lead of 4-0. Although Lin attempted to counterattack and win back two games, the overall situation was hopeless. In the end, Lin made another self-inflicted error, losing the fourth set 6-3. In total, Qiu won the final victory with a score of three sets to one.</p>
<p>▲ A Matter of Luck: Looking at the players' skills, each had their strengths and weaknesses, making it difficult to determine who was better. Lin's serve was sharp and swift, and his net play was ingenious. Qiu's reach was long and powerful, and his play was steady and reliable. But Lin's biggest flaw was his inability to control his temper. This was the reason for his defeat on the 19th. In short, the two players were evenly matched in skill, and both were top tennis players in our country. Victory or defeat was due to luck, good or bad.</p>

<p>▲ Improved Technique: Qian Yaobin, a former Shanghai junior player representing Sichuan, has improved a lot. His forehand shots are extremely powerful. Wang Wenzheng had a difficult time dealing with them. Therefore, the competition in each set was close and hard to separate. The first set lasted as long as twenty-two games before a winner was decided. From beginning to end, they followed each other closely, with each winning a game in turn, neither giving up slightly. Qian played with ease, repeatedly achieving remarkable feats of skill. Wang made many self-inflicted errors, making it difficult for him to win. Wang took the lead due to his advantage in serving. After the score was tied at 10-10, Wang finally won 12-10, but it was a hard-fought victory. Wang made many errors, while Qian's backhand shots were even more successful, winning the second set 6-2.</p>
<p>▲ Ultimately Victorious: After each winning one set, the two sides competed even more fiercely. The third set was again difficult to decide. In the struggle, Wang took the lead 4-1, and the situation was extremely favorable. After Qian won his serve, Wang repeatedly made self-inflicted errors, while Qian's brilliance was fully revealed. In an instant, the score was tied at 5-5. Wang won his serve, and Qian returned the favor, making it 6-6 again. Wang then tightened his grip and won two consecutive games, winning the fourth set 8-6. Qian was already at the end of his strength, and his shots had no confidence. When his shots touched the net and fell short, Wang won five games in one breath, but then carelessly gave away one game and ended with 6-1.</p>

<p>▲ Zheng and Yu are Sharp: In the Shanghai-Sichuan doubles match, Shanghai sent out the young pair of Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang, while Sichuan was represented by Li Nan and Zheng Zuju. The difference in strength between the two sides was significant. Zheng and Yu's shots were like arrows, unstoppable. Their net play was skillful and their overhead smashes were powerful, making it difficult for their opponents to counter, leaving them helpless. They won the first set 6-1 with ease. The second set was also easy, 6-2. The third set was slightly more competitive, 6-4. The three sets ended in just three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, Central News Agency, 19th) Wu Tiecheng and Chen Lifu, members of the Central Committee, have always been very concerned about the Northeast issue and have a deep friendship with people from the Northeast. At 5:30 pm on the 19th, they invited more than 90 people, including team leaders of the Northeast athletes, as well as representatives of the Northeast people residing in Beijing, to a banquet at the Central Hotel. Wu gave a speech, briefly saying that since the fall of the Northeast, the Northeastern compatriots have been scattered in all directions. Fortunately, the National Games are being held in Beijing, and the Northeastern athletes are actively participating in performance sports, promoting the national spirit, which is commendable. He specially invited everyone to have a good time. The invasion of our Northeast by a strong neighbor is the prelude to the destruction of China. Saving the Northeast is saving China. We can only work hard to improve ourselves and strive to save the country. He proposed a toast, wishing everyone good health. Chen then gave a speech, briefly saying that the participation of the Northeastern athletes in the National Games actually shows that although our land has fallen into enemy hands, the people's politics are still unified and complete. We should pay attention to physical, intellectual, and moral education in the future to save the country. He hoped that everyone would work hard. Wang Zhuoran, acting president of Northeastern University, delivered a reply speech, first expressing his gratitude, and then stating five hopes: (1) Provide relief to Northeastern refugees; (2) Provide additional funding to schools that accommodate Northeastern students to support their cultivation; (3) Resettle unemployed compatriots from the Northeast; (4) Provide relief to the families of the righteous army; (5) Hope that the central government has a comprehensive plan for the revitalization of the Northeast, and so on. Finally, everyone shouted slogans such as "Long live the Northeast," "Long live the Kuomintang," and "Long live the Republic of China" and dispersed.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 19th) In the men's basketball competition, Hebei defeated Shanghai 49-30 to win the championship. Hebei's teamwork was extremely skillful, and guard Zhang Jingde was able to attack and defend, especially agile. Shanghai lost both its home advantage and its unity, far less brave and skilled than when in Shanghai. The inability of the forwards to defend was the biggest reason for their defeat. At the end of the first half, Hebei led 18-10. At the beginning of the second half, Chen Xianglong came on for Shanghai, and the situation changed dramatically, closely following Hebei, with the score at 18-20, Hebei only leading by two points. But in an instant, Hebei regained momentum, and Yu Jingxiao repeatedly made remarkable contributions. In the end, Hebei 49, Shanghai 30. Hebei won the basketball championship of the Second National Games.</p>
<p>Men's Basketball Championship Hebei Team</p>
<p>▲ Each Team Has Its Own Talents: Hebei has Tang Baokun's assistance, Yu Jingxiao's bravery, and Zhang Jingde's superb skills. Shanghai has Lu Zhongen's strategy, Feng Nianhua's speed, and Wu Guolin's wonderful shooting. Each has its own strengths. The competition was fierce. It is a pity that the refereeing was not perfect, which was a slight blemish. In the end, Hebei won 49-30 to win the championship. The details of the competition are summarized below.</p>
<p>▲ Hebei Displays Dominance: The two teams face off, each with drawn swords and cocked crossbows, preparing to fight. Song Junfu and Tong Furan, the battle begins with a fanfare. Hebei's Zhang Jingde gets the ball from Tang Baokun and strides forward. Before Wu Guolin can make a contribution, he commits a foul. Hebei gets one point from the free throw. Zhang Jingde attacks again and scores again. Wu Guolin redeems himself, making the score 3-2. Hebei makes several short passes, and Zhang Jingde seizes the flag three times. Yu Jingxiao launches an attack from the middle and also scores. Zhao Shouchang prevents Feng Nianhua from shooting under the basket, making one of two free throws. Qian Jingyong arrives belatedly. Zhang Jingde is as fast as lightning, breaking through the enemy camp four times. Zhao Shouchang launches an attack from the west, and Feng Nianhua's rescue is too violent. Hebei gets another point. Tang Baokun fouls, and Qian Jingyong safely benefits.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Sees the Situation Deteriorating: and calls a timeout. With the momentum still strong, the battle resumes. Qian Jingyong gets a pass from Feng Nianhua on the baseline and breaks through the basket. Shanghai launches a second counterattack, but Feng Nianhua misses an opportunity under the basket. Tang Baokun does not return to defend but hides under the basket. Zhao Shouchang sees an opportunity and passes the ball from afar. Tang Baokun profits. Wu Guolin displays his skills, breaking straight in. Qian Jingyong loses his defense. Zhang Jingbao, like a horse freed from its reins, gets a pass from Tang Baokun on the sideline, raises his hand and scores two more points. Qian Jingyong is determined to retaliate, dribbling forward. Zhang Jingbao refuses to give up, obstructing him and committing a foul. Lu Zhongen turns around and shoots out, and Qian Jingyong shoots in the air, surprisingly hitting the target. Hebei's forwards make connecting advances. Wu Guoxia defends back and forth. Lu Zhongen loses sight of one while attending to the other. Shen Yugong cleverly steals a ball. Feng Nianhua gets a ball from Sun Baoqing and goes straight under the basket. Zhang Jingde is unwilling to give up and pushes hard. Jian Qin Tong Furan hesitates for a long time and judges it as a foul, but neither side gains anything. At the end of the first half, Hebei 16, Shanghai 10.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai's Efforts Fall Short: Changing sides to fight again, Qian Jingyong moves slowly, and Zhang Jingde scores two points first. Veteran Chen Xianglong cannot help but be furious and puts on his armor and goes into battle. As expected, the momentum is greatly enhanced. Feng Nianhua skillfully avoids Zhao Shouchang and makes a hit. Instantly he's as slippery as a loach and incomparably lively. Zhen Xianglong jumps down a ball, and Feng Nianhua succeeds in one fell swoop. Liu Zhenyuan replaces Shen Yugong. He immediately commits a foul as soon as he comes on. Feng Nianhua gets another point. Tang Baokun rushes back to his own camp and also fouls. Lu Zhongen also hits the mark, and Shanghai is at 18-26, trailing by two points.</p>
<p>▲ Hebei Suffers a Setback: Shanghai is about to go to another level and turn defeat into victory. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jingde becomes active again and scores two points. The Shanghai team attacks repeatedly, and the referee is particularly sensitive, accumulating fouls. Yu Jingxiao makes a free throw, and Tang Baokun follows up with a ball. Lu Zhongen, with the skills of a great general, snatches back two points from the crowd. Yu Jingxiao launches an attack from the middle, but Chen Xianglong's block is ineffective. Tang Baokun receives Yu Jingxiao's ball and throws it in the air, surprisingly getting a stroke of good luck and scoring another point. Chen Xianglong and Feng Nianhua recover three balls from two directions. However, Tang Baokun is always a lucky general, throwing once and throwing twice, and again seeing success. Qian Jingyong enters the field again, but it does not make up for the overall situation. Only Hebei's men are seen running back and forth, full of energy. Sun Baoqing causes Zhang Jingde to foul, but the free throw is not made. It turns out to be a blessing in disguise and gets two points instead. Zhang Jingde fouls four times, but the record does not notice, and he gets four more points. Hebei then wins Shanghai 49-20.</p>
<p>▲ Discussing Both Sides' Skills: Hebei and Lu are all from Hebei, and their teamwork is especially commendable. Zhang Jingde's defense and attack are both well-balanced. Tang Baokun's assistance is effective. He is indeed a head above the rest. The Shanghai team is used to fighting indoors, and the ball is not what they are used to, so they are at a disadvantage in terms of terrain. In addition, Qian Jingyong's defense is ineffective, making it difficult for the defenders to defend. Lu Zhongen is good at guarding, although his throws are very inaccurate. Shen Yugong has also not been able to achieve success. In terms of skill, Hebei's teamwork is better.</p>

<p>▲ Result: 4-1 Victory over Hebei</p>
<p>Guangdong's Pitcher Gao Wanen Has Excellent Skills</p>
<p>Match Resumed in the Fourth Inning After Guangdong Players Used Force to Mediate</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) In the men's baseball final, Guangdong played against Hebei. Guangdong attacked first, and the situation was tense. There were no records in the first five innings. In the top of the sixth inning, Guangdong's Wu Shunde got a hit. In addition, Hebei's fielder made a decisive error, and Guangdong scored three points in a row. Hebei resisted forcefully, and the momentum was great. With the bases loaded, Guangdong's defense was tight. Only Liang Ruilin got one point. In the ninth inning, Guangdong added another point. As a result, Guangdong won 4-1 to win the championship. Guangdong's pitcher Gao Wanen has excellent skills, leaving Hebei with no way to survive. In the top of the fourth inning, Guangdong and Hebei players used force. The entire team surrounded and beat Hebei's first baseman Feng Daoyuan. After the referee and Hebei officials tried their best to mediate, the game continued. After the game, Hebei wanted to retaliate and asked the military police not to interfere. The military police did not agree and defended very strictly, so no trouble occurred.</p>
<p>▲ Lin Jinyou's Arm of Iron: Guangdong's pitcher Lin Jinyou was born with an arm of iron and has trained his entire arm. His fingers have strong control, and the ball's arc is sufficient, leaving Hebei with no way to survive. In the nine innings, Hebei had a total of nine players who struck out, and he only let one walk. After Guangdong scored two points in the sixth inning, Hebei tried to counterattack. With the bases loaded, Jin Yun used his full strength and showed his wonderful pitches. Sure enough, he was miraculous, and Hebei only got one point. As a result, Guangdong won 4-1 to win the championship.</p>
<p>▲ No Success in the First Three Innings: Guangdong attacked first. At the beginning, the first three were killed and did not get on base. The same was true for Hebei. The first inning passed peacefully. Two Guangdong players struck out in succession. Cheng Guanjie got a hit, but Huang Yunbao's high ball went out of bounds, and they did not gain anything. Hebei was trapped by the strict defense, and three players struck out in succession. The second inning was still without a record. In the third inning, after two Guangdong players were out, Mao Lianrong took advantage of an error at first base to get on base, and then advanced to third base. The situation suddenly became tense, but Wu Shunde hit a high ball, and the shortstop made a wonderful backhand catch. Guangdong still did not score. Hebei's Luo Zongqiang used his strength, but each struck out, and the overall situation was gone. In the first three innings, both sides' formations were tight, with no gaps to take advantage of.</p>
<p>▲ Full-Scale Fight with Fierce Momentum: A dispute suddenly arose in the fourth inning. Guangdong's Gao Hansi hit the ball, and the third baseman intercepted it and threw it to first base. The ball arrived first, but Gao still rushed to first base with all his might, hitting Hebei's first baseman Feng Daoyuan. Feng scolded him, but Gao, without distinguishing right from wrong, punched him. Other Guangdong players also swarmed up and launched a general attack on Feng. The situation was serious and terrible for a time. Fortunately, other Hebei players understood the importance of the situation and did not join the battle. The referees and others tried their best to mediate, and the game was able to continue.</p>

<p>▲ Lin Jinyou's Appearance Was Unsuccessful: Cheng Guanjie got a walk. Huang Yunbao's high ball went out of bounds again, and there was no gain. When Hebei attacked, Gu Peilin's high ball was caught by the second baseman. Guan Funa managed to get on base. Guan Fuzhao hit not far, and the ball was intercepted by the third baseman, sent to second base, and then to first base, resulting in a double play. Hebei was at a loss.</p>
<p>▲ Each Displayed Their Skills in the Third Inning: In the fifth inning, Guangdong's Huang Zhaoxiong's fly ball went out of bounds, and he also stole a point. Li Jionglun struck out. Mao Lianrong got a walk, and it seemed that things were going straight up, but Chen Guangming hit the ball not far. The third baseman got the ball, got to second base, and then passed it to first base. Hebei also performed a double play, making Guangdong's efforts futile. Hebei's Luo Zongxing was killed midway. Bao Wenpei and Feng Daoyuan were cornered. Guangdong's pitcher Lin Jinyou's curveball struck them out, causing them to sigh in vain. At the end of the five innings, there was no record. The tension of the situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>▲ Guangdong's Momentum Suddenly Rose: Starting in the sixth inning, Guangdong suddenly succeeded, and the momentum was like fire. Hebei's hands made mistakes, losing three points in a row, planting the seeds of a fatal loss. Wu Shunde contested the ball and shot it to the left outfield. Gao Hanen followed behind and got on base. Lin Jinyou walked onto the stage. Wu was already at third base. Then all the bases were loaded. Cheng Guanjie sent Wu back to the camp. Lin went to second base and was killed. Huang Yunbao struck out and was killed. Huang Zhaoxiong then sent Cheng back to the camp, and Guangdong got three points. Li Jionglun's fly ball went out of bounds, and the situation changed. Hebei suddenly suffered heavy losses and was unwilling to surrender. The team leader meticulously made a plan to counterattack, but Luo Zongqiang went on and immediately went off. Fortunately, Liang Duanqi got a hit, and Fang Zhengcai reaped without labor. Liang had already stolen to third base. Gu Peilin also got a hit, and Liang returned to the camp, recovering one point. After Fang stole to third base, he was not reconciled and risked returning to the camp, but was surrounded and killed by six people. The overall situation was gone. Guan Funa was struck out again and went off the field. Guangdong then took a 3-1 lead.</p>
<p>▲ Final Result 4-1: After this inning, both sides went through vicissitudes of life, and were extra careful. Although Guangdong's Mao Lianrong got a walk but was killed at second base, Chen Guangmin again failed and went off. Wu Shunde struck out. Seeing the wind turning, Guangdong's spirits were boosted. The pitcher's skills became more and more wonderful. He made three consecutive at-bats, killing a total of two people. Hebei lost again and went down. In the eighth inning, Guangdong's Gao Hanen had reached third base, but there was no follow-up and he could not take advantage. Three Hebei players made one after another and made a final struggle. Guangdong's Li Jionglun took advantage of the shortstop's and first baseman's mistakes and was sent back by Chen Dui Min's hit, adding another point. Hebei's Fang Zhengcai was struck out again. Gu Peilin's ball landed and accidentally got on base, but he died as soon as he reached the base. Although Guan Funa hit a long ball, it still did not achieve anything. The game then ended, and Guangdong won the championship with a score of 4-1. Guangdong had a total of five hits, and Hebei only had two. The score in each inning was only Guangdong 3 and Hebei 1 in the sixth inning, and Guangdong 1 in the ninth inning.</p>

<p>(Nanking, 19th dispatch) The women's volleyball finals were held at 3 PM on the 19th.</p>
<p>Shanghai played against Peiping. Shanghai's lineup was exceptionally well-organized, having initially defeated Jiangxi, then Fujian, and followed with three victories over Lingnan. Their momentum was magnificent. In the championship, the strength of South China was originally quite formidable, but during the three-match week, Hong Kong and Guangdong were simultaneously eliminated. Facing Peiping in the final round, the championship was within grasp, leaving no doubt. At 2:30 PM, the referee Wu Bangwei arrived leisurely carrying the ball. Subsequently, the Shanghai team, dressed uniformly and known for their spirited nature, also arrived from the front lines, awaiting the Peiping team's entrance to begin the battle.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Preemptive Strike with Imposing Demeanor <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's Xiao Jieying took the initiative, displaying her fierce power, willing to die blocking and spiking against the Peiping team. Peiping scored three points on each serve. Guan Liuzhu's passing and setting were skillful, and Xue Zhijie's spiking was eager. The front row of three players desperately blocked. The battle was intense. The Peiping team, seeing the fierce and invincible opponents, became confused and lost six consecutive points. After switching sides, Qian Shuyi served consecutively, scoring until fifteen points when the ball was intercepted by the Peiping team. From then on, the lead alternated. The "Black Whirlwind" Xue Zhijie truly displayed the demeanor of a great general, serving three consecutive balls that landed in the corner, impossible to save. Peiping then lost the first set.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Helpless and Unable to Resist <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>In the second set, Peiping, seeing Shanghai's rampant performance, felt greatly ashamed. The three front players were sluggish and unable to spike effectively. They were unable to attack the enemy or defend the net, leading to a complete collapse. They simply awaited the referee's decision, lacking any ability to resist. The score of this set was 21 to 5, with Shanghai winning.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Carelessness Leads to Loss, Blame Lies with Themselves <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>In the third set, Peiping changed personnel and launched a counterattack. Shanghai, arrogant due to their victories, played without brilliance. As expected, arrogance leads to defeat. In a short time, the saying was proven. In the first half of the set, Shanghai trailed 9 to 11. After switching sides, Shanghai turned it around to 17 to 11. Shanghai only needed one more point to end the set, but they became complacent and careless in facing their opponents. Unexpectedly, the front row failed to block, losing a point, and Peiping served again. At the same time, two hard spikes went out of bounds. At this point, Peiping's score took the lead at 21 to 20. Finally, repeated net fouls occurred, eagerness to win led to consecutive self-inflicted losses, resulting in a 25 to 23 defeat to Peiping.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Redoubling Efforts Brings Success <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>In the fourth set, rain drizzled. The Shanghai ladies, knowing their mistake in the previous set, didn't hesitate to correct it, redoubling their efforts, and their attitude became even more calm and composed. Wang Xuehua's serves were like continuous mortar fire, completed in one go. The Peiping ladies were perpetually under bombardment, conceding as many as twelve consecutive points. The Peiping team truly appeared like survivors of a disaster. Wang Xuehua's arm was nearly broken. Subsequently, Peiping's Li Wushan passed the ball to the front row, but their light cuts and spikes made no progress. The set ended at 21 to 9, with the Shanghai women overjoyed, winning the championship.</p>

<p>The organizing committee stipulated that track and field and swimming competitions would use a scoring system, with first and second place distinctions. Ball games adopted a knockout system instead of a round-robin system. Except for the championship team, there was no runner-up title.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 19th dispatch) At 2:30 PM on the 19th, the 10,000-meter exhibition race began. Five participants included Jin Gudesheng, Wang Huibin, Chen Shusen of Shanghai, Wang Zhenglin, and Su Jinzhongkang. At the start, Gu led, followed by Wang, Chen third, Wang fourth, and Jin in last place.</p>
<h3 id="e217">No Change <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>There was no change from the first to the fifth lap. In the sixth, seventh, and eighth laps, Jin Zhongkang chased up, with Wang Zhenglin remaining in fourth place. In the ninth lap, Jin briefly surged ahead but soon fell back to fourth. There were no changes in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth laps. However, Wang Zhenglin was very close, conserving his strength for the final sprint. In the thirteenth lap, Jin's attempt to surge failed and was overcome by Wang Huibin, who took the lead. Jin remained in fourth place, and Gu Desheng fell back to second.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Mid-Race Scenario <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>No change in the fourteenth lap. In the fifteenth and sixteenth laps, Gu moved forward again, with Jin still in fourth and Wang Zhenglin at the rear. By the seventeenth lap, Jin gradually showed his strength, surging to second place, forming a lineup of Gu, Jin, Wang Chen and Wang Zhenglin. By the eighteenth lap, Gu still led, about twenty meters ahead of Jin. Wang Huibin was behind Jin, and Wang Zhenglin of Shanghai remained at the rear, conserving energy for the sprint. By the nineteenth lap, the final stage had arrived. Jin sprinted with all his might, surging ahead of Gu by several meters.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Final Half Lap <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>In the final half lap, Jin fought even harder, eventually outpacing Gu by over twenty meters to win the championship. Gu looked pale, showing signs of exhaustion, and ultimately failed to qualify, which was quite unexpected. Jin's expression remained unchanged. In the final half lap, he had already secured first place, finishing in 36 minutes and 1 second. Wang Zhenglin of Shanghai sprinted with all his might in the final lap, finishing only four or five meters behind Jin, proving his reputation as a great general was well-deserved. Wang Huibin of Jin came third, Chen Shusen of Jin fourth, and Gu Desheng fifth.</p>

<p>The 10,000-meter exhibition drew national attention. Nearly 50,000 spectators attended. Taxis in Nanjing were fully booked. Key figures of the National Government, including Shao Yuanchong, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhu Jiahua, arrived before 2 PM. Upon completion of the race, the audience applauded continuously for as long as ten minutes. The Jiangsu team waved their hats and cheered joyously. Zhu Jiahua particularly expressed his respect for Jin. Jin even went to the Eastern rostrum to meet the key figures before departing. A previously unresolvable public case was thus settled. Those who praised Gu turned to praise Jin. Su Jin's name will be widely known in this era.</p>
<h3 id="e221">A Farewell Letter from Athletes of the Five Northeastern Provinces One Word, One Tear, Unbearable to Finish Reading <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>▲ Ardently Hoping and Sincerely Praying</p>
<p>▲ Next National Games to Be Held at the Shenyang Sports Field</p>
<p>▲ The Overall Championship is to Restore the Colors of the Northeast</p>
<p>Fellow comrades and compatriots, the Games have closed, and everyone has returned home. We, however, continue to drift. For us, these ten days were like a reprieve from a shipwreck, a chance to see our homeland again, to reunite with our siblings, an immeasurable blessing. Therefore, every blade of grass and tree here seems to hold infinite affection for us. Every word and smile from you all seems to carry deep meaning for us. Truly, your handshakes have healed much of our shattered spirit, and your applause has strengthened our will to fight. We truly hate to part, but the nation needs each of you to work hard. Life itself can be sacrificed, so what is separation? Goodbye, everyone. The autumn winds are harsh, take care, take care.</p>
<p>The spoils of victory that you take back are either five-foot golden spears or championship silver shields. Guess what treasures we are taking back? "Hope" and "Confidence." Seeing your spirit of teamwork and the vigorous strength of your bodies, we are indeed confident that China has hope. Therefore, we hope that the team spirit displayed on this athletic field can spread to all sectors and can revitalize the strength of the nation. We not only hope that land will not be lost again but also that we can reclaim our beautiful land. Looking at the amazing records that you have created, we increasingly believe that anything others can do, we can also do. As the saying goes, "He is a man, and I am a man; whoever acts can be so." It only lies in one's own efforts. If the Japanese can destroy a country, can't we restore it? Therefore, the souvenirs we bring back from the athletic field are the beliefs that "With you, the Northeast will not fall" and "With you, the Northeast will surely be strong." As for ourselves, we will of course stand on the front lines and work hard.</p>
<p>Goodbye, everyone. In a single word of farewell, you have given us these precious souvenirs - hope and confidence. How grateful we are! How can we repay you? All we have are the scars left behind by painful experiences, awareness, and recognition to give to you. We realize that before today, the path that Chinese youth were accustomed to taking was completely wrong: shouting slogans, pasting posters, talking about revolution while neglecting the nation, discussing national salvation while abandoning scholarship. After all, it cannot stop planned aggression or resist wars with national characteristics. We, from top to bottom, each looked after our own interests and sought our own benefits, so that in the end, when the skin is gone, what can the fur adhere to? Only perishing together. Our only way out from now on is to bury ourselves in hard work, endure hardship, and train hard. In a word, be foolishly diligent.</p>
<p>Our second scar is recognizing our own responsibilities. In talking about national disasters, it is always good to blame a few individuals or a certain political party. In fact, apart from the good people who work diligently all day long, who does not bear a considerable responsibility? We, scattered north and south, often hear voices of complaint and blame, and rarely see warriors who fulfill their responsibilities and say, "If not me, who?" More often, credit is claimed for oneself, and blame is shifted to others. National grievances can be ignored, but private hatreds cannot be left unavenged. Wrong practices become the norm. Even if the Japanese do not come to destroy us, how can we be spared? As Nelson famously said, "England expects that every man will do his duty." Today, China truly needs everyone to do their duty. We must have this awareness to transform ourselves and to revive the nation.</p>
<p>Our awareness and recognition are gained from the nation's unprecedented sacrifices and our own immense suffering. The price is too high. We give them to you to take back, to share with everyone, and to advise them not to pay the same price. Alas, the taste of national subjugation is truly not to be tried. Originally, the civilization, barbarism, rise, and fall of a nation all depend on whether they can exchange experiences. The disasters we have suffered, we hope, will be sufficient for our compatriots to learn from. If all the youth of the country can recognize their responsibilities, our hope will surely be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Our confidence will surely be realized. Finally, we ardently hope and sincerely pray that the next National Games of the Republic of China will be held at the Shenyang Beiling Sports Field and that the overall championship of the next National Games of the Republic of China will be to restore the colors of the Northeast. We have come this time and received the sympathy and assistance of the government authorities and compatriots from all walks of life. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks on behalf of ourselves and the Northeast Sports Promotion Association. Dare to salute, athletes from the five provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jehol, and Harbin, Nanjing, October 20, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e222">My Thoughts on the National Games <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xuesong</p>
<p>This year's National Games was held in Nanking. I was fortunate to participate in the event and have many observations. Thinking back to last year in America, the enthusiastic atmosphere of welcoming our country's delegation to the World Games, another year has passed without realizing it. Considering the reasons for Europe and America's progress and our country's decline, there are two main reasons: one is the lack of promotion from above, and the other is the lack of effort from below. However, apart from this, the lack of magnificent and complete sports venues also consistently hinders the popularization and development of sports. This time, the central government spent 1.3 to 1.4 million to build the National Games venue, including track and field, swimming pools, basketball courts, martial arts arenas, etc., all of which are extremely magnificent. The excellent facilities not only aid sports but also show the hard work of those above in promoting them. On the athlete's side, more than 2,000 athletes gathered from the north and south, with full spirits and serious attitudes. The records of each event have shown excellent progress, which is also greatly different from the past. This is truly gratifying. The referees were cautious in enforcing the rules, all of them being well-informed and experienced individuals in the country, which is truly admirable. It is hoped that the athletes can uphold the spirit of sportsmanship, not focusing on wins and losses, so that the Games can end completely without any disputes. In terms of venue layout, it was also very perfect due to the hard work of the organizers. Although there were some improper arrangements in the reception, with so many people and complicated matters, the representatives had to be understanding. As for the public, participation was also very enthusiastic. Compared to those who were indifferent to sports in the past, this has also changed drastically. This is also sufficient evidence of our country's achievements in promoting sports in recent years. If the National Games can be held annually, then the future progress of sports can be predicted.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 19th) The second National Martial Arts Examination will open on the morning of the 20th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Commander-in-Chief He Xilu both sent telegrams to Beijing to express their congratulations on the National Examination. The telegrams are recorded separately as follows: (1) Telegram to Director Zhang Zhen of the Central Martial Arts Academy: I have learned that I have been recommended as the Honorary Chairman of the Second National Martial Arts Examination. This matter concerns the revitalization of the national spirit and I will certainly strive to undertake it. However, I am currently busy with the suppression campaign and cannot attend the meeting. I have telegraphed Vice Minister Cao of the Ministry of Military Affairs to attend on my behalf. Secret, Chiang Kai-shek. (2) Telegram to Mr. Zhang Zimin, Director of the Central Martial Arts Academy: I have respectfully received your telegram. Martial arts are the foundation for strengthening the race and saving the country. The Central Government is holding this examination this time, and I deeply admire its enthusiastic promotion. I very much wanted to participate in the grand ceremony and also planned to go to Nanchang and then to Beijing to receive your instruction. However, due to the arrangement of the suppression campaign, I was unable to start the journey. I am deeply sorry. I have now sent Chief Captain Li Lijiuchao to Secretary Kairan, leading the staff to Beijing for reference. I would be grateful for your guidance. Respectfully, He Jian.</p>

<p>▲To be Held for Three Days Starting November 12th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has decided to hold a joint sports meet for all elementary schools in the city, starting on November 12th, for three days. The budget is currently being prepared and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, in order to proceed actively.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3 id="e231">Large Batch of Inspectors from the Ministry of Education Depart <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has dispatched twelve people, including directors, section chiefs, specialists, counselors, and supervisors, to inspect various provinces and cities. This news has been reported in previous issues. Now, the members have set their departure dates. For the thorough understanding of readers, the details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Inspection Areas: Nanjing (Inspected by Supervisor and Section Chief Zhong Daozan), Shanghai (Director Gu Shusen), Jiangsu (Counselor Chen Shizhen), Zhejiang (Supervisor Dai Xia), Fujian (Supervisor Tang Xifen), Henan and Shaanxi (Supervisor Zhou Bangdao), Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan (Supervisor Gu Zhaoxing), Hebei (Section Member Dai Yingguan), Shandong and Qingdao (Specialist Guo Youshou), Anhui and Jiangxi (Specialist Li Ximou), Guangdong and Guangxi (Counselor Chen Panzao), Hunan and Hubei (Section Chief Wu Yan Yin).</p>
<p>▲Departure Dates: Director Gu Shusen departed first on the 16th. After two weeks of inspection in Shanghai, he will return to Beijing. Section Chief Wu Yan Yin will depart at the end of the month (because the Director and Section Chief of the General Education Department cannot leave completely, so that someone can handle official business in the department). Specialist Guo Youshou will depart on the 19th. Counselor Chen Panzao is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 18th or 19th to wait for the ship, and will depart for Guangdong around the 21st (it is said that there will only be a ship on the 21st). Supervisors Zhou Bangdao and Gu Zhaoxing and Section Chief Dai Yingguan will travel together from Beijing on the 19th, departing separately in Xuzhou and Tianjin. Counselor Chen Shizhen is scheduled to go to Zhenjiang on the 20th to inspect education administration and secondary teacher training and vocational education, stay in Zhenjiang for a week, and then go to Yangzhou. After staying in Yangzhou for three days, he will return to Beijing. The second time, he will depart again to the Shanghai-Nanjing line, first to Wuxi, and the third time to the Xu-Hai area. The reason for departing three times is that among the four counselors, one works in the specialist's office. When three go out, only two are left, and the department is busy with affairs, so one person must travel back and forth to coordinate. Supervisors Tang Xifen, Dai Xia, and Specialist Li Ximou will also depart around the 20th. Supervisor and Section Chief Zhong Daozan will depart to inspect education in Nanjing City approximately next week (after the 22nd).</p>
<p>▲Key Points of Inspection: In late September, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to all provinces and cities, attaching inspection objectives on "Vocational Education," "Education Funding in Provinces, Cities, and Counties," "Status of Education Implementation or Promotion Plans," "Status of Implementing Compulsory Education and Public Education and Opinions for Improvement of Responsible Persons," "Extension of Secondary Education for Women (Including Vocational)," "Implementation Status and Opinions of Responsible Persons of the Examination Regulations for Graduates of Primary and Secondary Schools," "The Current System of Free Tuition and Scholarships and Similar Methods in Various Types of Schools in Provinces, Cities, and Counties and Suggestions for Improvement." It is hoped that all departments will pay close attention and make full preparations in advance, with relevant materials to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>On October 16th, the Ministry of Education also ordered all members to assess the performance of social education promotion in various provinces and cities, with the main points being: (1) Whether the social education funding of each province and city has reached the standards stipulated by the National Government and its plans for raising the full amount. (2) Achievements and plans of each province and city in eradicating illiteracy. (3) Achievements and plans of each province and city in promoting physical education.</p>
<p>On October 17th, the Ministry of Education ordered the Education Departments of all provinces and cities to work with inspectors to formulate the following specific measures and submit them to the Ministry for review, namely, the first item of the previously issued survey objectives regarding the status of vocational education, Section 1 (specific measures and implementation status regarding the implementation of items 1, 2, and 3 of the Ministry's No. 9736 circular), and the first item of the second item regarding the status of education funding in provinces, cities, and counties (the amount and source of education funding in provinces and cities and the methods and plans for ensuring and auditing it), the second (the specific plans of provinces and cities where education funding is not yet independent to seek independence of education funding), and the third section (methods and plans for the consolidation of local education funding).</p>
<p>▲Inspection Period: Each member is responsible for inspecting a maximum of three provinces and cities and a minimum of one province and city. The inspection period depends on the distance of the journey and the convenience of transportation, generally lasting up to fifty days, with a month being the majority. This inspection is different from previous ones. All schools must be inspected in detail, and much guidance must be given on education administration. For secondary schools, emphasis is placed on vocational and teacher training education.</p>
<p>▲Circular for Investigation: Due to transportation constraints, inspectors will not be dispatched to the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Xikang, Qinghai, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou for the time being. However, on October 2nd, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to the Education Departments of Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Xikang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, attaching eight survey objectives with a time limit (one month for the first six items and two months for the last two items) for submission, to be used as the basis for assessment.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Director Gu of the Education Bureau Investigates the Educational Situation in This City <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has dispatched inspectors to various provinces and cities to investigate the educational situation. Mr. Gu Shusen, Director of the General Education Department, who came to Shanghai some days ago, has already been in Shanghai for many days. On the 17th, Mr. Gu visited the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and met with Director Pan Gongzhan. He has started the inspection in the past two days, accompanied by a supervisor specially assigned by the Education Bureau. It is reported that the scope of this inspection, in addition to public and private schools at all levels, particularly focuses on social education and vocational education. Furthermore, education funding and its implementation status and promotion plans are under thorough investigation. Mr. Gu will remain in Shanghai for more than ten days. Once the investigation of this city is completed, he will return to Beijing immediately and will not travel to other ports.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Zheng He's Voyages to the West <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Previously, Yongle Emperor sent Zheng He to the South Seas, which added a unique interest to the communication between China and the islands of Southeast Asia. It was still very valuable to increase the understanding of China by Southeast Asians. In my estimation, the long-lasting prevalence of this story has been fueled by the addition of embellishments and exaggerations in folk legends. The vernacular novel "Eunuch Sanbao's Voyages to the West" is not very impactful because its depiction is too unsophisticated, so its influence is minimal.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu Yunqiao, who resided in Java and Siam for five years, there are numerous myths about Sanbao in various parts of Southeast Asia, and he is addressed as "Sanbao Gong," with statues erected and temples built to commemorate him. The impression he left is even greater than that of Zhang Qian and Ban Chao in the Western Regions. However, Chinese records of Sanbao, apart from a few pages of simple descriptions of his merits in the History of Ming Eunuchs, are completely devoid of anything else. Colonialism without support is ultimately subject to exclusion, and a grand but impractical pacification policy cannot compare with the well-planned, organized, and resourceful Dutch East India Company. The dispute over the Spratly Islands is truly like losing the bamboo raft and trying to salvage the "firecracker" pole.</p>
<p>Wang Risheng's Taiwan Waiji (Outer History of Taiwan) states that Yongle Emperor sent eunuch Wang Sanbao to the Western Seas, combining Zheng He's childhood name with his companion Wang Jingxian's surname. He also says that the Dutch asked Sanbao for blueprints of seagoing vessels, but Sanbao, fearing that they would use the ships to harass the borders, deliberately used a broken brush to draw a flat circle with two or three vertical sections from end to end in the middle, then splayed the brush bristles and made random strokes. The Dutch copied it accordingly, installing a rope for tracking like all the brush bristles, resulting in a ship that was actually sturdier than the Chinese seagoing vessels. This legend is extremely naive, and those with even a slight knowledge of Dutch colonial history would probably laugh at it. However, it is true that Zheng Chenggong drove out the Dutch and occupied Taiwan because he was threatened by Qing soldiers. This is written vividly and with much detail.</p>
<p>The History of Ming spells "Sanbao" as "Sanbao," but both novels and Southeast Asian historical records spell it as "Sanbao." This is inconsequential. However, it is laughable to conflate Southeast Asia with the West. This is due to the era, and cannot be deeply blamed. Chinese people only know that Mount Putuo is in the South Seas, so naturally the idea of the abundant Southeast Asia never occurred to them.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Meeting Room <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Reception rooms, waiting rooms, and meeting rooms are all places to receive guests. Some are not called rooms but halls, which implies a larger scope in terms of definition. We know that a meeting room can be analyzed for many qualities: mysterious, open, sweet, or bitter. In a meeting room, all sorts of tragic and joyful dramas of separation and reunion can be performed! Colorful dramas of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure can be performed! For every organization or group, the meeting room is a central element, and the hosts of the organization or group must put effort into its management. According to the nature of the organization, they arrange the room with elaborate decorations. Closer guests are invited into the host's office, like the "signing room" in old officialdom.</p>
<p>For example, in a school, there would be slogans like "Love, Sincerity, Excellence, and Perseverance" or "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage." Enlarged photographs of the principal and graduation photos of students would be decorative elements. Gleaming silver trophies and vases, the more dazzling, the more they demonstrate excellent athletic achievements, with a constant metabolism of athletes. Glass-framed inscriptions from important figures of the Party and state would indicate the numerous awards they have received. Tragic and joyful dramas of separation and reunion also take place in the school's meeting room. The sadness of lovers parting as one goes off to study, cherishing each other and saying goodbye. The joy of Saturdays and Sundays, the school's usual visiting hours. They are originally performing the tragedy of "a day apart feels like three autumns," but are now joyfully reunited and naturally filled with boundless joy: watching movies, eating Western food, and all the unspoken things in between. As for separation and reunion, they can also imagine it in the meeting room. They hate to meet too little! Why part after one night? Longing deepens! Unexpectedly encountering each other fills them with joy? These are the kinds of situations. I once heard of a desperate man who went to see his lover at a girls' school. The gatekeeper pretended to make things difficult, demanding a bribe. The desperate man understood and quietly placed a five-yuan bill under the teacup. This secret of the meeting room then spread throughout the school.</p>
<p>In officialdom, the higher the rank of the person, the more difficult it is to get an audience. Their meeting rooms invariably have two orderlies, or servants who are ruthless exploiters, who use their power to manipulate the guests. When many guests seek an audience with an important figure, they are generally received in the order of their calling cards. If you don't give the servant some small favor, he will turn your card upside down. When the important person's visiting time is over, they will wave their sleeves and leave. What are the joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures in this? You can understand it just by looking at the guest's face as they leave the yamen. If Director XX or Chairman XX invites this guest to their office, the guest will boast to everyone they meet that Director XX or Chairman XX showed them special favor. In fact, from ancient times to the present, the face of a superior has never been pleasant to look at, so it's no wonder that Tao Yuanming indignantly said, "I will not bow for five pecks of rice."</p>
<h3 id="e237">Crying <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>"A man does not shed tears lightly." This saying means that a man's tears will not "wet his blue gown sleeves" unless he can no longer bear it.</p>
<p>But it is not the same for women. Crying is their specialty, so when someone dies in a family, they always find a few women who are good at crying to guard the mourning tent. When they see a guest coming to offer condolences, they start sobbing. After the guest has paid their respects, they immediately stop crying and start talking and laughing. Is there any sadness lingering in their hearts?</p>
<p>Even more so, when a daughter is about to get married, the wedding sedan is at the door, but the bride is sobbing, unwilling to leave her family home. But when she returns home three days after the wedding, she is talking and laughing again. At that time, I don't know whether the bride's heart is sad or happy?</p>
<p>And when a couple quarrels over some trivial matter, and the man strongly refutes her a few times, she can only cry, to soften you men, or else she will play the tricks of crying, starving, and hanging herself, frightening you into running away! These cries are all hypocritical cries.</p>
<p>When a child doesn't get their way, they will cry, and you will give in to them. They know that crying has such great power, so they use crying as blackmail!</p>
<p>So I think it is really not easy to make a man's "tears wet his blue gown sleeves." Except for a few men who shed tears of longing when their parents abandon them, or a handful of tears of farewell when lovers part, I have never seen a man cry loudly. So some cries are all hypocritical cries!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Changes in the European and American Novel World <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Speaking of Edgar Wallace</p>
<p>In recent years, the best harvests in the European and American novel world that have won the praise of audiences are no longer those works that specialize in love and teach people how to flirt, but rather stimulating short detective novels. Among them, the great English novelist Edgar Wallace is the most successful.</p>
<p>The change in audience tastes, needless to say, is influenced by the turbulent situation in the concessions. Anyone with a little insight knows that struggle and striving are the only way out for all people and all groups in the future, so they absolutely don't want to waste their precious time on soft reading materials anymore. What they need is the excitement of hot blood, the sharpening of courage, and the cultivation of bravery. Therefore, Edgar Wallace's "The Four Just Men" has been hailed as the number one work of honor in the British literary world in the past three years because it meets all these conditions.</p>
<p>This book has recently been translated into Chinese by Qin Shouou (sold by China Travel Service in Shanghai and other places). Although I am unwilling to flatter him, I dare to say without hypocrisy that he has not diminished the merits of the original book at all, it is as tense, stimulating, and exciting as the original!</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that this work by an Englishman can awaken the dream of those of us who have no soul, and I hope that in the near future, works full of "the beauty of strength" like this can also appear in our own literary world.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Who Can Be Without Emotion? Family Thoughts Discourage the Troops; Soldiers Do Not Suppress Fraud; Bold Words Strengthen the Army</p>
<p>Guan Yaowu has a large family and is burdened enough by his family. But he can't bear to abandon them. Old Tian is an unmarried couple, burning with passion. As for me, I really can't be said to have any relationship between men and women. I shouldn't, shouldn't have been engaged to the Yang family girl on this day. Now that I'm leaving her behind, I can't help but feel a knot in my heart. If I didn't have this engagement with Guizhi, I could come and go freely. Although I still have such an old father, he has always encouraged his son to go to war. He always said, "Raise soldiers for a thousand days, use them for one morning." Even if he is reluctant in his heart, under the current circumstances, it would be somewhat embarrassing to say the word "support," because saying "support" would be making fun of the Yang family girl. After I leave, the Yang family mother and daughter will talk even more behind his back, and it will be even more difficult for him to deal with. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but worry about my old father for a while, and with a disheartened mood, I wanted to go back to the company headquarters to see what Guan Yaowu's attitude was. Thinking this, I soon arrived at Guan's company. Looking inside the door, I saw him lying horizontally in his room, on that small bed, facing upwards, with both legs hanging down from the bed. He had his arms crossed in front of his chest, and I didn't know what he was holding in his hands. His two hands and two index fingers were just spinning incessantly. I laughed and said, "Hey! Old Guan, you're so relaxed." Guan Yaowu turned over and sat up, laughing, "You suddenly said something and scared me." Zhao Ziqiang walked into the room and said, "Where has your mind gone? I said such a lighthearted thing, and you were startled." Guan Yaowu said, "That's right, I'm a lost soul now." Saying that, he chuckled, rubbing his hands together endlessly, showing a troubled expression, wanting to completely vent it out in this rubbing of hands. (217)</p>

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>In this world, only men spend money to watch female models, no women watch male models. Women, even if they accidentally see a man without pants, are always afraid and run away as if they had seen a big snake. However, tonight is an exception. The women in the alley not only did not run away, but all stood up, craning their necks to look at the man without pants. I was extremely surprised.</p>
<p>"Wooooooo..." The man without pants shouted. "Haha, so many sluts, you want to see? I'm not wearing pants. Ha, ha, ha! Woooooo..."</p>
<p>"Ah, it's him." I couldn't help but exclaim. At the same time, I remembered the scene from a week ago, one night.</p>
<p>That man had only run a few steps towards the alley entrance when he was pulled back by three men; another woman helped him put on his pants.</p>
<p>"No, Xiao Fangzi, I have to find that little rabbit bastard, you can't hold me. Woooooo... Little brother-in-law, evil has its retribution, don't be so ruthless, you know? Get out of the way, you kids, take the horse and find the little rabbit bastard! Woooooo...."</p>
<p>"You three follow him around and come back, don't cause trouble, be careful." That woman said.</p>
<p>So, along with the nosy ones, a total of a dozen people escorted him away.</p>
<p>What is going on? I was just about to go home and ask my wife when I heard a young man next to me ask a woman in her thirties, so I stood and listened.</p>
<p>"I don't know what his surname is, I only hear people call him Kunshan..."</p>
<p>"Kunshan? He must be named Huang. He plays 'flower association'. Huang Kunshan, a tiger." A child blurted out.</p>
<p>"Kunshan was once sick and didn't go on the boat. The more days he stayed at home, the more he heard from friends that his sworn brother was being taken advantage of. At first, he didn't believe it, but after three or four people said it in front of him, he couldn't help but have some doubts in his heart. He sent someone to inquire for a few days, and it was indeed the case. After the man named Zhang came back, he told him everything in detail. He was very angry at the time. Unexpectedly, the woman's rice soup was so effective that the next day, she blamed Kunshan, saying that Kunshan shouldn't ruin her reputation. Kunshan just smiled when he heard this. That woman wouldn't let Kunshan off, and kept telling Zhang that Kunshan wanted to take his place, and that he should give Kunshan's position to her brother as soon as possible, to avoid being attacked by others in the future. Finally, she said that if he didn't believe it, he could inquire everywhere. Zhang inquired and it was indeed the case. In fact, this was all arranged in advance by that woman and her man. So when the last shift of the boat left, there was one less Kunshan on the boat, but one more woman's brother! That is the little brother-in-law that Kunshan was shouting about."</p>
<p>"At that time, Kunshan's illness had not yet recovered, and he was angered by the loss of his job, and the man went crazy. He has been a madman for three or four years now. All day long, he is not given food or drink, and he doesn't eat or drink; when he eats, you give him four or five big bowls, and he can eat them all. He defecates and urinates all over the place, and only his wife (the woman who helped him put on his pants) suffers, it's not a life for a person. Usually, Kunshan doesn't say anything, like a mute. When he thinks of something, he shouts all night. Or he runs outside, saying he is going to catch the little brother-in-law." The three men who just pulled him are all his sons; the money the three of them earn each month is not little, and they are very filial to their father, which shows that good is rewarded with good..."</p>
<p>"Wooooooo... Get out of the way, I've caught the little brother-in-law! Woooooo..."</p>
<p>A dozen people escorted him back.</p>
<p>I watched him enter the door, and two words suddenly appeared on my mind: madman.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Yellow Peril <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— You Gang</p>
<p>The current so-called "Yellow Peril," we ourselves are referring to the breaching of the Yellow River, but thirty years ago, it was not like that. At that time, it was interpreted as the yellow race about to sweep Europe. Some heroes, upon hearing this, were as pleased as when they were praised by white people as "sleeping lions," and were complacent for several years, preparing to become the masters of Europe. However, the origin of the "Yellow Peril" story is different from what we imagined, it originated with the German Emperor Wilhelm. He also drew a picture, a Roman-dressed warrior, resisting a person coming from the East to the West, but that person was not Confucius, but Buddha. The Chinese were really happy for nothing. So while we were dreaming of the "Yellow Peril," the reality seen by someone in Qingdao under German rule was a poor child who dirtied an electric pole and was picked up by the white patrol, like the Chinese dealing with ducks, and carried upside down.</p>
<p>Now, Hitler's idea of ​​excluding non-Germanic peoples is the same method as the German Emperor.</p>
<p>We no longer dream of the German Emperor's so-called "Yellow Peril," we no longer mention the "sleeping lion," and "vast land and abundant resources, large population" is rarely seen in articles. If it is a lion, it is okay to boast about how fat it is, but if it is a pig or a sheep, being fat is not a good sign. I don't know what we ourselves feel like now?</p>
<p>We seem to no longer think, nor can we find any "symbol." We are watching Haijingbo's wild animal show, appreciating lions and tigers eating beef, and I heard they eat a cow every day. We admire the League of Nations' sanctions against Japan, we despise the League of Nations' inability to sanction Japan; we approve of military reduction to "protect peace," and we also admire Hitler's withdrawal from military reduction; we are afraid of other countries using China as a battlefield, and we also hate anti-war conferences. We still seem to be "sleeping lions."</p>
<p>"Yellow Peril" can turn into "fortune," and awakened lions can also act. During the European War, we had workers who risked their lives for others, Qingdao was occupied, and we had children who could be carried upside down.</p>
<p>But to say that there is no place for us on the stage of the twentieth century is reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="e242">A Dissenting Opinion <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Zhecun laments the lack of vocabulary in the writings of today's youth and advises them to read "Zhuangzi" and "Wen Xuan." I beg to differ. I believe that the abundance or scarcity of vocabulary is actually due to the completeness or lack of common sense, and fundamentally, it is due to the amount of practical life experience. Simply reading a few books is in vain. The writing of "Zhuangzi" is produced by Zhuang Zhou's philosophical thought and actual knowledge. In his "Nourishing Life" section, the "Butcher Ding Dissects an Ox," the description of dissecting an ox can be said to be rich in vocabulary. May I ask Mr. Shi, where did these words come from? Could they come from someone who has never carefully observed someone dissecting an ox? For the average reader, it already takes a lot of effort to understand the words in Zhuangzi's articles today, and if there is no other basic knowledge, many chapters cannot be understood at all. Can they use the vocabulary in them at their disposal? As for "Wen Xuan," since it collects a large number of authors, the actual knowledge it contains is even broader, so the vocabulary is even richer, but those words are definitely not obtained by reading any books, most of them are created by the author based on actual knowledge. Just look at the San Du Liang Jing Fu, which has the richest vocabulary, and you will know.</p>
<p>The ancients did not have to rely on the books of their predecessors, and could create new words themselves. Today, knowledge is easy to acquire, and life is even more complex, but instead, we have to go to the books of our predecessors to find vocabulary. What do young people think of this opinion based on the theory of regression? Not necessarily very ancient people, even after the Tang and Song dynasties, there were still people who understood that the articles of Sima Qian had a strange spirit, which was helped by famous mountains and great rivers, but today people think that "Zhuangzi" and "Wen Xuan" are models for all ages.</p>
<p>Recently, the vocabulary in Chinese works is also really poor, far inferior to foreign works. But this reason lies in the lack of basic knowledge of Chinese people, while foreigners, because of the completeness of their education or the richness of their life, their works are so substantial. The greatness of Gorky's works is due to the "seeing a lot," and as for the Russian "Zhuangzi" and "Wen Xuan," they had little influence on him.</p>
<p>To describe factories, go to factories. To describe rural areas, go to rural areas. Those who understand botany should describe trees. Those who understand astronomy should describe the sky. Then the vocabulary will naturally be rich, the metaphors will naturally be appropriate, and the descriptions will naturally be wonderful. It is much better than having read "Zhuangzi" and "Wen Xuan." Many people notice the influence of old literature in Lu Xun's works, but why don't they see the influence of natural science and practical life experience in them?</p>
<p>Scholars like Mr. Shi Zhecun are indeed known for their rich vocabulary—vocabulary from ancient texts. But vocabulary is formal, and the content of our literary works is more important than form. Rather than appreciating carved, exquisite, but empty things, we would rather see works with substantial content and rough form. Like the shape of politics, today's literary rules are also gradually becoming stricter, and young people's creative activities in various aspects are intentionally or unintentionally being restricted by someone. The "mentor" system in the literary world will be restored. "Alas! I want to emulate the ancients' ability to create, but my fate does not meet the time. I want to follow what the people of today follow, but I am ashamed." (Gong Zizhen's Literary Style Admonition)</p>
<h3 id="e243">Letter to Mr. Li Liewen <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>— Also for Mr. Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>Brother Liewen:</p>
<p>That day on the tram, I was in a hurry because I was going to the Minjiu Society bookstore to buy a book I liked, so I got off at Wangjiasha. But in the end, I didn't buy the book because the price didn't match, and I missed the opportunity to talk to you for a moment longer, which I regret very much.</p>
<p>Regarding the "Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan" issue, I have decided not to say anything more. Originally, when I filled out the form sent by the Dabao Evening News editorial department, it did not contain the seriousness that Mr. Feng's opinion showed. I am not saying that every young person must read these two books, nor am I saying that every young person only needs to read these two books, nor am I saying that I only have these two books to recommend. Probably the editor of the newspaper supplement wanted to add a little novelty to it, and the people filling it out mostly casually wrote down whatever books they thought might be worth reading. Had I known that writing this would cause such a big literary dispute, even if Mr. Cui Wanqiu, the editor of the Dabao Evening News supplement, had winked at me, I would not have written it. Today I saw a letter from Mr. Cao Juren to me in the fortieth issue of "Tao Sheng," the last sentence of which is: "Is there anything more beneficial to young people than these two books? Dare I ask." This question really made me laugh and cry. (Mr. Cao Juren's letter is very sincere, I will give him a reply, and maybe he will publish it in "Shou Sheng," I hope you take a look.)</p>
<p>I don't want to offend Mr. Zhizhiyu again, but I still have a few opinions regarding the three additional points he made in his "Old Issues" article!</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Feng said: "Some new youths can have old ideas, and some old forms can also contain new content." Yes, new youths can still have old ideas, so it seems that I, as a limb of the group of remnants, can also be left alone with old ideas. As for old forms also containing new content, it seems that it is okay to write ancient prose like "Zhuangzi," just look at its content.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Feng said that he doesn't understand the difference between my advice to young people to read "Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan" and the examiners taking scholars based on their words. There is actually a clear distinction. The former is to offer one's own views to young people, and whether or not they accept it is up to the young people's freedom; the latter represents the entire class (Note: the class of officials.) and almost forces the entire youth to fill in the lyrics. (Unless this youth doesn't want to be an official).</p>
<p>(3) It is indeed ridiculous to say that Mr. Lu Xun's articles came from "Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan." I remember that I did not say such a thing. In my article, I cited Mr. Lu Xun as an example, intending to ask the anti-old youth to get a little literary cultivation from ancient books to help. Although Mr. Lu Xun has always advised young people to read more foreign books, this is because he believes that young people with new ideas can be trained from foreign books; as for thinking about young people from the perspective of writing articles (or literary cultivation) like me, Mr. Lu Xun has never opposed young people reading ancient books. Let me give two pieces of evidence: (1) "Reading less Chinese books will only result in not being able to write articles." (See page 4 of the Beixin edition of the Cover Collection,) This shows that Mr. Lu Xun also admitted that to be able to write articles, one should read more Chinese books. And this so-called Chinese book, judging from the above, does not seem to refer to vernacular documents. (2) "I am often asked, what books should I read to do literature?… I think if you want to do the old stuff, you might as well rely on Zhang Zhidong's 'Book List and Answers' to find your way." (See page 45 of the Beixin edition of Already Collected.)</p>
<p>Now, I think I should "stop" here. I once gave a letter to the editor of the Dabao Evening News supplement, and out of respect for Mr. Feng Zhiyu's good intentions, I asked permission to exchange two books to introduce to young people. Apart from writing a letter to Mr. Cao Juren, I have nothing to say about this "Zhuangzi and Wen Xuan" issue. I have seen text disputes on the wall of "Free Talk" several times, and I feel that each time they always become more and more emotional and further and further away from the topic, and even later some participants' motives are questionable. I don't want to be involuntarily drawn into the whirlpool, so I won't say anything more. Last night I used a ready-made gatha: This is also a right and wrong, That is also a right and wrong. Only without a view of right and wrong, Can one avoid right and wrong.</p>
<p>Is there anyone who can write seal characters? I would like to ask for a law to wave and stick it on the white wall. Shi Zhecun Shang (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e244">Communication from Ganpu (7) <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Aying</p>
<p>Brother ○○:</p>
<p>The salt manufacturing process was already discussed in the previous two letters. Now I want to continue by describing the general living conditions of the salt producing area of Ganpu and the salt workers.</p>
<p>The salt fields here are divided into three districts: East, West, and South. The East district is ten li long, the West district is two li long, and the South district is about one or two li long. The number of salt workers in the East district is seven or eight thousand, in the West district four or five thousand, and in the South district only a few hundred. The number of salt kilns is eighteen in the East district, ten in the West district, and three in the South district. According to my investigation, the annual salt production is about 13,000 yin, equivalent to 19,000 dan, with an official price of 2.4 yuan per dan, valued at 456,000 silver dollars. Each district has a kiln director (灶董), one for the East district, and one shared between the Southwest districts. The selection of these kiln directors is similar to electing representatives during the National Assembly; they are chosen through joint consultation between the government and salt merchants. These individuals usually have three qualifications: first, they have had prior dealings with government officials and salt merchants; second, their family finances are reasonably sound; and third, they are more knowledgeable than the average salt worker. What these kiln directors are like? I won't say, you probably already know. In name, they are representatives of the salt workers, but in reality, they do not represent them. Instead, they simply follow the orders of government officials and salt merchants, helping them to impose levies and taxes. It is said that one of them is relatively good and can represent the salt workers to some extent, but I don't know to what degree. Such figures are the leaders of all the salt workers. Therefore, the salt workers here are often starving and have no food to eat, while taxes are still increased, and the kiln directors do nothing about it.</p>
<p>In Ganpu, the salt workers do not entirely rely on salt production for a living. They also do other things to supplement their income. For example, people in the Southeast districts also farm. At the same time, in addition to salt production and farming, salt workers in the East district also cultivate land, plant trees, and about three hundred people also engage in fishing. In the West district, only a few salt workers own mountains and fields, and some near the North-South Lake also fish. In addition, salt workers naturally have many side businesses and by-products, such as silkworm rearing, etc., but the main ones are firewood and hemp. However, there is a peculiar phenomenon in Ganpu that must be mentioned, which is that regardless of whether they are salt workers or farmers, they do not grow vegetables in the summer and autumn. You can't buy vegetables; if you really want to eat them, you have to gather wild herbs yourself. This is because their fields are used for other purposes at this time. They only grow vegetables as usual in winter. The salt workers actually suffer a lot, although in any district, we don't see any thatched huts, but all tiled houses. The largest number of salt workers are shoulder-pole peddlers. They sometimes help others with work, sometimes sell lightly taxed salt, and often go hungry. Salt workers do not all own salt kilns or kiln shares. Generally, the brine they collect is either sold to the "Chaofeng," i.e., the so-called "kiln directors," or they rent the kiln directors' kilns to burn themselves. However, this is ultimately a small number. Most sell the brine. Some salt workers have actually borrowed money from the Chaofeng at high interest before the brine is collected, and repay it with a lot of brine. The Chaofeng own many salt ponds, storing the brine inside. When the salt in the warehouses is sold out, they use oil barrels to pump it out and burn it. Usually, they seal it with mud tendons. If you come to Ganpu, you can see that the kiln areas are full of brine barrels everywhere. Some are beside the road, and some are in the middle of the road. What you are walking on is a road, but below the road are brine barrels. It can truly be said that salt is everywhere. Moreover, next to this, you may sometimes see rectangular, lidless boxes with wooden edges of about one or two inches, filled with salt brine, placed under the sunlight. This is called "sun-dried salt." Salt is sometimes produced by "drying" instead of "burning."</p>
<p>The overall aspects of the salt workers' lives are roughly like this. The rest, we'll talk about next time.</p>

<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Jean had been, from a young age, a model of gentleness, goodness and character; while Pierre, constantly hearing others praise this older child, gradually became agitated. In his view, Jean's gentleness was weakness, goodness was stupidity, and good intentions were blindness. His parents were peaceful people, only hoping that their two children could obtain a respectable but ordinary position, scolding him for being fickle, ... for getting excited, scolding him for those failed attempts, and all the ambitious, yet unattainable aspirations.</p>
<p>When he grew up, people no longer said to him, "Look at Jean, learn from him!" But every time he heard others repeatedly saying, "Jean did this, did that," he understood the meaning of these words and the implied hints they contained. Their mother was an upper-class woman, a frugal, and emotionally sensitive bourgeois, with a naturally gentle and meticulous character. She constantly mediated the small animosities that arose between the two sons every day from the most minor matters of their shared life. And at this time, there was also a minor event that made her uneasy, she feared that things would become troublesome, because last winter, when her two children were finishing their specialized studies, she met a neighbor, Mrs. Luziemi, the widow of a deep-sea ship captain who had died at sea two years ago. This young widow was very young, only twenty-three years old, an intelligent woman who instinctively understood life, like a free beast, as if she had seen, experienced, understood and measured all events, she could criticize with a sound, narrow, but well-intentioned intelligence. She was accustomed to running over to the homes of these two kind neighbors every evening to have a cup of tea and chat for a while.</p>
<p>Mr. Roland, whose obsession with being a sailor was constantly stirring up, often inquired about the deceased captain in front of his new female friend, and she would talk about her husband, her husband's travels, and those old stories, etc. She spoke so eloquently, fully expressing the character of a woman who loved life, respected the dead, was rational and could be patient.</p>
<p>After the two sons returned, finding that this beautiful widow often came to their home, they immediately began to flirt with this woman, the main motive not being to make the woman like them, but to defeat their brother.</p>
<p>Their mother, who was prudent and practical, desperately hoped that one of the two could conquer this widow, because this young woman was very rich. But she also hoped that the other would not be in any grief.</p>

<p>—Supply and Demand Mutually Vary, Market Mostly Oscillates—</p>
<p>The gold market rebounded again yesterday, with a steady and firm trend expected for the future. In the early morning, overseas silver futures in the UK and the US rose, but the long-term silver price at the Gold &amp; Silver Exchange shrank by two and four li respectively. Although the exchange market closed long, it suddenly plummeted at closing, which boosted confidence. London raw gold rose by one shilling and one pence, US new mined gold rose by 4.7 jiao to 30.33 yuan, stock dropped by 3.18 yuan, US cotton dropped by 11 pence. Spot trading opened firm at 25-26 yuan, continuing its firmness after opening, showing a stable situation. Chen Feng Yong Wen strenuously purchased US exchange and Tiaozi, and Hong Li continued to buy persistently. Therefore, the gold price was finally able to break through 30 yuan, but it was difficult to sustain for long due to banks taking the opportunity to unload their holdings at high prices. At noon, rumors of a Russo-Japanese conflict circulated. Retail investors had already turned short and tried to depress prices, while the domestic port supplied firmly, resulting in a rapid decline. In the afternoon, the situation reversed as banks showed a stronger appetite, and the Guang Gang began to buy in to cover their positions. It was reported that Chen Feng Yong also purchased, and the price eventually broke through 30 yuan again. Industry sentiment was mixed, and supply at high prices was also active. The closing price remained within 30 yuan. It was observed that the overall situation of the day was quite volatile. Many Western merchants were optimistic. Reuters reported rumors in the exchange market about abandoning the gold standard, which also supported the bullish view. If France were to truly abandon the gold standard, those who had stored US funds in France would inevitably repatriate them, which should tighten the US exchange rate. The exchange rate looks to shrink. In addition, speculators are using this opportunity. The future of the US dollar seems bright. The Hechi price was 1,123 yuan. The market conditions for the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 827.5 yuan, a rebound of 9.7 yuan compared to the previous close. Goods opened at the same price.

Despite this, unfavorable rumors spread in the market. Goods worked hard to supply the Tiaozi. Zhao Feng Chang Yuan Chun Hong Xing Da Xing Yong Yi Da Yong, etc. jointly sold the Tiaozi, January US dollars at 3.75 were difficult to sell and fell to 2.2 yuan. The noon closing was 822.6 yuan, after the closing, Zhi Feng Yong Da Chang Xiang slightly picked up, once rising to above 3 yuan, but finally remained flat. Goods were bid at 2.8 yuan.</p>

<p>and rose again to 8.6 yuan, Mitsui had already taken January US dollars at 2.5 also. Fu Yu Bing Xing Da Lian Gang supplied the Tiaozi, retreating to 7.2 yuan.

Later, Yi Yu Fu Yu Da Chang Xiang Da Xing Yong sold again, speculator Mr. Yang sold out, falling to 27 yuan. After fluctuating, the closing was 827.5 yuan. After the closing, goods raised prices, goods were bid at 8.5 yuan, and finally Heng Yu advanced enthusiastically, lacking supply, and actually skyrocketed to above 30 yuan.

<p>—Overseas Interbank Lending Rate Remains Unchanged—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver and money industry saw a significant amount of activity in both inflows and outflows, especially in long-term transactions, resulting in frequent settlements of various kinds. However, inflows and outflows related to commercial goods were also more frequent than usual. The overseas interbank lending rate in the market remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 0.6 percent. Due to the supply of funds exceeding demand, overnight loans were consistently flat. In the morning market, over 5.2 million yuan worth of draft transactions were transferred, with nearly 500,000 yuan in short-term transactions, and over 200,000 yuan in afternoon transactions. Small associations saw over 400,000 yuan in transactions. The amount of banknotes redeemed and issued was particularly high daily, with around 2.2 to 2.3 million yuan, due to the large number of banks and the outflow of secretly marked notes. Overseas mortgages saw over 800,000 yuan in redemptions and over 600,000 yuan in new mortgages. Customer sources totaled 100,000 yuan, with 200,000 yuan shipped to the Yangtze River and 100,000 yuan to the interior. Foreign banks saw settlements of over 2.3 to 2.4 million silver yuan and over 3.2 to 3.3 million foreign currency yuan in bills and drafts, over 3.1 million silver yuan in special funds, and over 5.4 million silver yuan and over 5.8 million foreign currency yuan in settlements for various goods, remittances, mortgages, deposits, and miscellaneous items.

<p>Over the past two days, the silver and money industry has shown some signs of interest in long-term lending. Local qianzhuang have not made many transactions, but Yongzhuang loans have been made in large quantities, with a total amount of approximately 2 million yuan. Interest rates for these loans ranged from 8.25 yuan to 9.5 yuan, with slightly lower rates for established customers, with the lowest rate being 7.75 yuan. However, there were also instances of higher rates, generally for smaller amounts, such as transactions of several thousand or 10,000 yuan, which reached above 10 yuan. As for silver syndicates, there is currently no fixed market price for factory loans. It is reported that the silver and money industry has set a rate of 10 yuan for long-term transfer interest rates for factories such as Fuxin, but the borrowers have not yet expressed their position. It is expected that a further price reduction will be necessary, and industry insiders predict that the rate will need to be at least 9 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a stable market with slight fluctuations, and the trend did not seem likely to decline. Trading was quiet, with few large investors entering or exiting the market. Retail investors were mostly observing from the sidelines, but with the settlement period approaching, swap transactions were still somewhat active. The market continued to fluctuate slightly based on supply and demand of chips. Without any special news during the day, the market was expected to remain positive due to the high number of open short positions. The opening in the morning was chaotic, with prices moving up and down by about 0.1 yuan. Trading was still active, with large investors showing some demand for Public Salt Tax, pushing prices up by 0.05 to 0.25 yuan. In the second session, short sellers slightly swapped positions, and large investors made some transactions, maintaining a balance, and prices uniformly increased by 0.12 to 0.35 yuan. The opening in the afternoon saw some retail investors selling, and trading was not active. The aforementioned varieties remained stable, while the Public Salt Tax market saw some long positions exiting, resulting in a decline of about 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The closing was flat, but Public Salt Tax declined by only 0.05 yuan, remaining stable. Overall, the market fluctuated, but it was unfavorable to continue this sluggishness. In the end, most prices were slightly higher by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan, and 18 Guan Jin short, 96 whole, and 6 all slightly declined by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The total turnover was 5,825,000 yuan. There were still no spot transactions. The total futures turnover was 1,915,000 yuan for Public Salt Tax, 825,000 yuan for Soldiers and Occupants, 815,000 yuan for 19 Public Welfare, and 1,230,000 yuan for 20 Rolls and 20 Customs. The turnover for 96 was over 40,000 yuan, and 18 Guan was only 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>

<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reported that on the 18th, the paper stock market weakened again due to a report from Washington that stabilizing the US dollar would be the foundation of US monetary policy, coupled with poor conditions in the steel industry and selling by speculators. It is advisable to be cautious in this fluctuating market. The total turnover for the day was 1,730,000 shares. Wheat continued to be purchased, and wheat prices rose, facing some resistance from speculators, but the government continued to purchase spot goods in various markets, which was beneficial to buyers. Cotton prices were quite robust at the opening due to purchases, as the government sold loans for seeds to farmers to hedge future contracts. Later, it fell back due to the impact of the stock market decline, but the spot market was not affected by this, as it was reported to be quite stable. Silver prices were quite stable in the morning, but fell in the afternoon due to the strong US dollar. The US Treasury Department gold price was 30.33 yuan per ounce. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market was flat and uneventful. After a certain association purchased yarn at a limited price of 84 yuan this month, most speculators adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sharp decrease in trading, and the market entered a standstill. However, the movement of spot yarn has been maintained in recent days, and the future depends on actual sales.</p>

<p>The Human Markings market opened quietly, with the market slightly weaker, due to a lack of sellers and long positions being closed. Prices for each month fell by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 jiao.

<p>The cotton market has been strong in the near months, as the cotton sold by sellers had too much moisture, resulting in many withdrawals, which strengthened the buyers' resolve, and short positions were covered. The market atmosphere tended to tighten, but the far months were relatively loose. The sources of supply from various locations have become increasingly active. Some expected a decline after the delivery period. Indian cotton prices were weak, and Shenxin Factory imported 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton from Rangoon.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Over 40 sources, the outlets for various brands of broken Geng rice are not wide. Although there is some activity from bulk purchasers, it is ultimately contrary to expectations. Only one load of Songjiang goods, totaling more than 130 bags, was handled, so it is still difficult to reverse the decline. Prices have fallen beyond expectations. As for new white and red rice, wild rice, Baige, and other Geng rice, supply and demand are quite compatible, and the market is stable. Warehouses are actively adopting bulk purchases, and the situation is better. New Luyang Jian has some activity from Ninghang brands, and the situation is also stable. New Yinyuan is strong due to lack of goods.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over 40 shipments from various sources, normal market sales, broken Geng rice, Da rice, various types, Baige price is stable, the new Geng rice market is tight in the morning, weak in the evening. Dujian price is slightly lower. Yangji, Baiyuan, and Yinyuan prices have increased slightly. Kejian and Bujian are flat and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the powder market, after opening in the morning, showed signs of stability. In terms of foreign wheat quotations, Chicago rose by about 9 jiao to 1 yuan and 2 jiao, and Canada was slightly better by about 1 jiao. Therefore, after the opening price, the sentiment of all months was good. Factories took the opportunity to replenish the current month. Tianjin also purchased 60,000 to 70,000 bags in various trades. Therefore, the near-term months were relatively better, but external customers were not very smooth, so the increase was still weak. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere in various months had slightly turned flat. Although factories did not sell, the purchase from outside the industry was really sluggish. In addition, the quotation in Tianjin was slightly lower by 1 fen, only 2 yuan, 1 jiao, 1 or 2 fen. The sentiment was flat, which was the reason. As for the expectations inside and outside the industry, it is believed that the arrival of foreign wheat in China is an inevitable event, so oversupply and dumping will be the focus in the future. As a result, the current month was lower by 5 li than the previous day, November was lower by 7.5 li, December was lower by 1.5 fen, January was lower by 1 fen, and February and March were lower by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally showed a flat and weak fluctuation. With the good quotations of foreign wheat, the market atmosphere seemed to be stable after the opening price. However, industry insiders speculated that although domestic storage is not very abundant, a batch of orders for foreign wheat has become a reality, and subsequent transactions are still inevitable. There is also a rumor that the spot price of American wheat is 2 jiao cheaper than the standard. With these various situations, the domestic future will naturally be dominated by prices. Therefore, the sentiment is generally flat, with little excitement, and the market atmosphere in various months has returned to weakness. As a result, the current month was down by 4 fen, November was down by 1 fen, December was down by 2 fen, and January, February, and March were unchanged. Spot wheat was not traded because factories had no demand.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Merchant's Coarse Rice Sells Well Alone, Machine and Various Xian Rice Fall Slightly by Several Fens, Foreign Rice Had Outlets on This Street Yesterday <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for merchant's Xian rice was still only purchased by Fujian gangs and single-handed merchants. Other gangs did not inquire. In fact, all Xian rice from the lower reaches of the river is now fresh, and there are still large inventories of foreign rice for sale. Customers are therefore waiting and watching, hoping to push down the price slightly before searching and buying. However, the owners, in view of the sharp drop in flour and wheat, are also unwilling to continue to hold on. The market has therefore seen a downward trend. However, the Fujian gang's purchases are not weak, and inland gangs also come to the market to inquire. The current stock of grain and rice is small, and only the Fuzhou and Quanzhou inland gangs are buying, and the market has rebounded by several fens. As the price of coarse rice has risen, machine and various Xian rice have also been pulled up. Therefore, in the face of falling prices, it has only fallen slightly by 3-5 fens. Throughout the day, the amounts sold from Quanzhou and Fuzhou to Hunan were 500 bags of machine rice at 7 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, 2,000 bags of rice at 6 yuan, 5 jiao and 1 fen, 2,000 bags of coarse rice at 6 yuan and 7 fen, and 1,000 bags of Nanjing machine rice at 6 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 fen, 200 bags of coarse rice at 5 yuan, 7 jiao and 7 fen. The price for medium and inferior grades was reduced accordingly. The inland areas also took hundreds of bags of Hunan rice and coarse rice. This street sold 500 bags of Saigon No. 1 at 8 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.</p>

<p>The market momentum for yellow soybeans has been balanced between arrivals and sales recently. Although the sources continue but do not surge, the outlets are connected but not interrupted. Yesterday, the market traded more than 1,400 bags of cargo by ship and 3-4 cars of cargo by train. The demand is strongest on this street.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Oil Market - Asphalt Falls Again and Again <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>As asphalt is nearing its new season, places with slightly larger inventories of old goods are making every effort to promote sales, so as not to mix the new and old in the future. It is found that there is not much in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, but there is still a sufficient inventory in Wuhan, with a total of more than 10,000. However, the arrival of new goods from the producing areas in western Hubei to Wuhan is also more convenient than elsewhere, so the sales period for old oil is still long. However, due to the extremely small sales volume, panic is inevitable, which has caused the market to fall again and again. According to the Wuhan market, Jing oil weighs only 18 yuan per load, and flat oil weighs 17 yuan with a slight surplus. Macheng is still weak at 17 yuan. Although it has fallen so much, it still cannot stimulate sales. It is probably not allowed to stop. The earliest new oil is produced in western Zhejiang. It is expected that wood oil will be available in sample form within a month, and bark oil can also be produced after the light snow. It is heard that the annual order is still good in Jiaxing this year. Although new oil sales have not yet started, they are roughly shipped to Shanghai at about 20 yuan per load. In recent days, many inland merchants have come to Shanghai to sell, but the traders and consumers are not satisfied, so the price is close for the time being. It is also unknown whether there will be a new offer in ten days or so. The offers from local traders have also fallen again and again to 22 yuan per load for heavy goods, 21 yuan for flat Jing, and 19 yuan and 6 jiao for Macheng.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although the spot price rose in the sugar market, the Dutch exchange rate increased, so the trend was still flat and weak. The association's list price for ordinary goods was 24, coarse sand white was 21 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen, and the original price was slightly higher by 5 jiao and 7 fen. No. 20 medium sand white was 20 yuan and 8 jiao, and Dutch red Nos. 8 and 9 were 16 yuan and 7 jiao. The Taikoo Sugar B Mark was priced up to 21 yuan and 6 jiao. The Zhonghua Guohua Zhenji Native Factory's No. 1 Mianbai was still sold at 20 yuan and 3 jiao, with no intention to increase, presumably because they were willing to sell cheaply in order to compete. Chao gangs offered a batch of Chaoqing, and the number of transactions increased, totaling more than 500 bags, the higher ones were 15 yuan and 5 jiao to 2 jiao and 5 fen, and 15 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, and 15 yuan, followed by 14 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen to 9 jiao.</p>

<p>Biguang Heifu plate glass has been in great demand by mirror factories recently, but the arrivals are very few. Therefore, there is a shortage of spot goods, and the standard has risen by 2 yuan, requiring 88 yuan per box. Customers from Tianjin, Yantai, Hankou and other places are also involved, so the supply cannot meet the demand, and the standard is even stronger. It is heard that more than 100 boxes were sold yesterday.</p>

<p>Ribbed steel bars have been selling very well recently. Customers and construction gangs have been purchasing, and the transactions have been very prosperous. It is heard that more than 100 tons were opened yesterday. The supply and demand are uneven, and the price has risen by more than 1 yuan, which is 111 yuan per ton. According to the observations of general industry insiders, there is still a possibility of further increases.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port's foreign firms saw a trend of quiet transactions. The British and Indian firms in Gongxi and Xiumei and other goods stopped trading yesterday. The Russian firm Xiezhuhui is still watching. Only Zhenmei and Zhenmei and other items, British merchants Doudetongfu Jinlong and other firms purchased more than 500 boxes. The market price did not fluctuate much. The foreign firm market is gradually declining. However, in recent days, the Tianjin, Shandong and other local gangs have successively purchased more than 1,000 boxes of Meiyu, Meixi, and Xiumei, and the outlets are very active.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Creation, Imitation, Enjoyment <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>- Guang Han</p>
<p>Everyone knows that mankind is a product of culture. It is because of culture that we humans are "different from animals," and so we have not sought the consent of plants, animals, and minerals, and have self-respected as "the holiest of all things." However, we humans, on the one hand, have the right to enjoy culture, and on the other hand, are also obligated to create it. Because to enjoy, we need to create; with creation, we can then enjoy. But let's take a look: how many people in the world today can exercise the right to enjoy and also fulfill the duty to create?</p>
<p>You don't have to be a Western worshiper. Can you deny that many modern cultural elements were invented by Westerners? Whether in material or spiritual aspects, just to give a few examples: the former like electric lights, trains, ships, and various machines; the latter like various new ideas and new academic disciplines. Which of these is not a contribution of the Westerners? Speaking impartially, we are enjoying this beautiful culture today, directly and indirectly, all thanks to their gifts. Their achievements in modern culture can truly be considered great; although their efforts, in some cases, may inevitably be flawed, but that is another question.</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan, they certainly do not have as much creativity as Westerners; but their imitation skills are truly astonishing. When someone invents something new, they cannot invent it themselves, but they can imitate it. Not only do they imitate it until it is exactly the same as yours, but they also manufacture it more exquisitely and skillfully than yours. Sometimes they can even discover a new thing through imitation, which is truly remarkable. This is solely in terms of material culture; as for spiritual culture, they have made not a few contributions to modern new ideas and new academic disciplines.</p>
<p>As for China, we cannot create, nor can we imitate; we can only sit back and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. We are smart enough; we are unwilling to bother to waste time and effort inventing. Nor do we deign to be so unprogressive as to imitate others' ready-made products. We have plenty of money. Today someone invents a motorcycle, and we immediately have a car to ride tomorrow. Tomorrow someone invents architecture, and we immediately have a Western-style house to live in the day after tomorrow. New academic disciplines and new ideas are introduced, and our grand works are published accordingly; our beliefs also begin to waver. In short, everything in modern civilization that others can enjoy, we can also enjoy in the same way. What else is lacking? Aren't we satisfied yet? Do we still want to disturb our minds, trouble our hands and feet, and personally learn to create and imitate?</p>
<p>Enough! What is learned here are three different national characteristics. Westerners are rich in creativity, so their culture can leap forward thousands of miles, becoming more and more new every day, and progressing endlessly. The Japanese are rich in imitation ability, so they can also keep pace with Europe and America, full of vitality. Only we Chinese know how to enjoy, so everything is lagging behind, and we are running down the road to death and destruction. From this, we can understand that a national characteristic has a very significant relationship with the culture of a nation-state, and we must not ignore it. I am not just speaking fine words that please everyone, or digging into our own shortcomings; because the facts are clear evidence and there is no need to conceal them. I hope that the people of the country will wake up as soon as possible, and quickly improve our national characteristics from the root!</p>
<h3 id="e271">The Poor and Love <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>- Qian Xu</p>
<p>Recently, I watched "The River All Red." It seems to me that whether poor people can actually fall in love has definitely become a problem.</p>
<p>"The River All Red" tells us that "if a poor person talks about love, he is simply looking for his own death." However, the love of the poor in "The River All Red" is successful, because although the sudden fire at the end burns the poor and the woman to ashes together, the fire comes so "suddenly" that we regard it as "far-fetched," a "tail" that is forcibly attached. If we cut off this far-fetched tail happily, then it will show the standard of successful love for the poor.</p>
<p>However, can the poor actually talk about love? Let's not talk about how serious the current social situation is, how bankrupt the rural economy is, or how many unemployed people there are in the cities; even if a singer is willing to condescend and look favorably upon a poor boy and talk about love, on the poor person's</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>side, he is concerned about whether there is enough bread, so where does he get so much leisure? Therefore, this argument, which deviates from the facts, only shows its "incomprehensibility."</p>
<p>However, whether people are poor or rich, male or female, when they reach a certain age, they naturally have an urgent desire in their hearts—that is to say, when they develop to a certain state physiologically, they will feel a kind of inexplicable "sexual" hunger. Therefore, "boredom" occurs. Thus, in order to dispel this "boredom," solve this "hunger," and satisfy the physiological "urgent desire," and on the one hand, to cater to the trend of the times, they "naturally" take the path of "love."</p>
<p>The poor person's current difficulty is "poverty," and the "path of love" is built on beautiful faces and sparkling money. The obvious contradiction leaves the poor with no room to intervene and is destined to fail before they realize their mistake. Therefore, poor people can only move forward and temporarily forget about "love," even though they have reached the age where they need love.</p>
<p>Moreover, the result of love can only hinder the motivation to move forward and increase the economic burden. It is absolutely unsuitable for poor people, and even more unsuitable for poor people who are struggling to move forward. Although there are also some advocates of love above all else who say: "Love can help people to have an interest in being human, can urge the progress of their careers, and can be regarded as a kind of motivation." Indeed, but it must have the condition of "not being poor" and must have "assets" as a backup; otherwise, it is still utopia and dreaming.</p>
<p>What's more, "love" is fundamentally a leisure game for those who are "propertied" and "have leisure," a tool to exert their "property" and "leisure" authority. If a poor person wants to squeeze onto this stage, it is simply very likely to fall down, and at the same time, he is in danger of falling to his death.</p>
<p>Therefore, my conclusion is: poor people can only attack their careers and solve the problem of "poverty." If you really want to step onto the stage of "love," it is not too late to wait until you are "not poor."</p>
<p>Because "poor people" and "love" are fundamentally unrelated.</p>
<h3 id="e272">A Salty Farce <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>- Shen Min</p>
<p>A friend who owns a signboard shop asked me to write a large character for a signboard a few days ago. This signboard was custom-made by a certain pickled meat shop. Carelessly, I accidentally wrote the word "salted" instead of "pickled." After writing it, I was in a hurry and did not check it, so I gave it to him. The friend in the signboard shop was illiterate, so he did not notice it. He followed the example and made the signboard, and then sent it to the pickled meat shop, hanging it high above the door, waiting for the shop's opening. The owner of the shop, a Ningbo native, looked up and burst into flames. "You, his mother, bitch born, what are you doing? Who wrote this salty meat shop signboard?" He grabbed the owner of the signboard shop, and the two twisted each other all the way to my residence, launching a punitive expedition. At this time, I already knew that it was because of the mistake of a single "salted" word. But I was not willing to show weakness, so I could only make the best of a bad situation and adapt to circumstances. He said that I opened a pickled meat shop, why did you write salty meat shop? Aren't you touching my bad luck? I said to him, "Don't just get angry, things must be practical, there are words to say, and reasons to argue. Isn't pickled meat and salted meat one and the same? Moreover, the restaurant serves salty meat and tofu soup, dry salty meat, and I have never heard of pickled meat and tofu soup, or dry pickled meat." He said, "That's not how it's said. Everyone knows that the salty meat shop is opened in the human flesh market near the Niutou Company on Baxian Bridge! Aren't you intentionally making fun of me and teasing me?" I said, "This is a common saying among idlers. In which meat market have you ever seen a salty meat shop signboard? This reason has no basis. Moreover, your shop sells salted fish, salted eggs, salted vegetables, salted jellyfish, etc., and you definitely can't change them to pickled fish, pickled eggs, pickled vegetables, etc." At this time, he was rendered speechless by my refutation. He was stunned. Later, he said that after this signboard was hung, it caused a sensation far and wide, and people came to visit in an endless stream, which made me very embarrassed. This is a matter of reputation! I said, "Don't get me wrong. This phenomenon is excellent. This is obviously because the signboard I wrote is special, and it is also a very wonderful publicity effect. Generally, when a new shop opens, it can cause a sensation far and wide, and people come to visit in an endless stream, which is a sign of prosperous business and abundant wealth!" When he heard these two auspicious words, he smiled and left. A salty storm had just subsided. Sure enough, there was an unexpected effect. The day before yesterday, I happened to pass by the shop. I saw people chopping salted meat, so crowded that they could not stand. Whether it was for the publicity of a salty word is also impossible to investigate.</p>
<p>Shanghai people call the third-class meat market a salty meat shop. I don't know what the meaning is. It's really inexplicable.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Zhabei Eulogy <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>- Wen Bing</p>
<p>The vast and prosperous Shanghai seems to refer entirely to the concessions. Shanghai is so worthy of praise! The concessions are even more worthy of eulogy! Writers, how many are racking their brains to write "Sketches of Nanjing Road," "Nights on Avenue Joffre!" Beautiful, happy, all the colorful scenes are poured out only in the concessions!</p>
<p>Zhabei, because it is still a piece of Chinese land, is so dirty, so desolate! Oh, this is simply the desert outside the Arctic Circle, the sand base in the oasis. Disappointing, dazzling, how can it be worthy of a latrine in the concessions?</p>
<p>And ask, who doesn't have such a feeling? Who doesn't harbor such contempt? Oh, is Zhabei really like this? No, absolutely not! If we were not full of some kind of poison, if we had not put on colored glasses, and also possessed the marrow of Chinese national character, we should be able to thoroughly understand that this is precisely where we deserve to praise!</p>
<p>Although the streets here are very dirty, and the market here is very desolate, this is just like a person dragging old clothes. Even his body and his soul are noble, pure, vigorous, and moving forward courageously!</p>
<p>Here there is no shadowy figure of high-class Chinese who flatter foreigners and seek glory, nor the rampant acts of very poisonous capitalists, nor the sinister laughter of unscrupulous merchants, nor the activities of modern gentlemen in the sex industry, nor the intoxicating murmurings of refined gentlemen. What exists is the activities of the common people, the struggles of the coolies. They are working to continue their own lives, for the reunion of their families, for the duties of mankind, for the future of the nation-state. Who has shed the disguise of the hypocritical identity of that word, is using their hands, using their feet, vigorously moving forward,</p>
<h3 id="e274">Modern Celebrity Painting and Calligraphy - Landscape by Mr. Wang Yun'ai (Brief Biography) <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yin, whose style name is Yun'ai, is a native of Zhui Li. In addition to reading, he also studies the six methods of painting. He is fond of chanting poetry and has a collection of poems called "Huaiyin Yin Guan Poetry Collection." He has followed Mr. Huang Binhong's guidance, and his painting skills have improved daily, inheriting the style of the Song and Yuan dynasties.</p>
<p>, comfortable music with a symphony of life. The small vegetable market and the small vegetable building are their heaven, where there are low-priced dramas to watch, and unregulated book markets. They have no desire to curry favor, they don't want to flatter foreign masters, and when they see useless, despicable fellows, they still sneer at them.</p>
<p>The little citizens covered in mud around Dayang Bridge and Tanzi</p>
<p>The little around Shiying Bridge and Tanjia Bridge</p>
<p>The voices of weaving the Anhui people along Zhongxing Road and Gonghe Xin Road.</p>
<p>The small carts and tools lined up side by side in the alleys next to the road.</p>
<p>The small citizens scurrying all over the street and the carters like cattle and horses</p>
<p>Coolies.</p>
<p>These, these, can you thoroughly understand the mysteries in them? If Shanghai didn't have such a Zhabei, if Shanghai had such a group of poor people, would the concessions be so prosperous? Would the rich be so happy? Would the world be so evolved?</p>
<p>After the "January 28th" Incident, countless loyal souls reflecting the living were added here. There are shocking bloodstains and battle ruins left here. There are no generals' heads, only soldiers' roars and shouts. Only some ordinary ghosts are flowing with light. Oh, saviors of the nation!</p>
<p>Writers who speak for the people, do you want to truly depict and praise the greatness of Shanghai? Please come here to search for the material that the public urgently needs! Truly great works can only be created in such a place. This is the place that nurtures writers and works! Hiding in the towering foreign buildings in the concessions, leaning on soft sofas, what are you shouting in vain?</p>
<p>This great Zhabei, the muscles and bones of Shanghai, let us be vigilant against being gradually swallowed up by the expansion of roads beyond the boundaries! Completely reduced to the foreign masters' athletic field!</p>
<p>Our Zhabei, our Zhabei bursting with energy, I am praising you like this, praising your greatness!</p>
<h3 id="e275">Various Kinds of Fraud <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Years Bing-Ding</p>
<p>Besides earning money through legitimate professions, there are truly many ways to obtain money in Shanghai. Swindling, stealing, cheating, begging, all sorts of tricks and endless variations. If one were to compile a special book on this, wouldn't it run into millions of words? However, although there are many kinds and various methods, their consistent purpose is to get other people's money without exchanging their own "labor" or "capital." Perhaps this is a phenomenon of "civilized evolution"!</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>When we are sitting in a tram or rickshaw, perhaps your hat will disappear into thin air, and the money in your pocket will vanish without a trace. Especially when you, sir, arrive at the Shiliupu Wharf on a Ningbo steamer at dawn, you may encounter some "chop-splitting" fellows who either grab your rickshaw, demanding a few cents for road money; or block your way, robbing your luggage. This is the first bit of money that a "Ningbo newcomer" should pay upon arriving in Shanghai, and it should be paid without delay. It's truly an unspeakable predicament.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>"Friend! Help a little!" "Know what's good for you, or you'll eat a raw bullet! Quickly hand over the money!" Night-walking friends living in Shanghai can often encounter the above phrases. How would you handle it, sir? This is to test your mettle. Generally, ninety-nine percent of the time, you, sir, will suffer a loss. If you're lucky, you can offer them a yuan or two as tribute. Or, they might invite you, sir, to "peel a pig," leaving you stark naked to return to your esteemed wife, who might even think you escaped after being subjected to forced sodomy. (Stealing your clothes is called "peeling a pig"; snatching your hat is called "grabbing a crow"; pulling your rickshaw across a bridge is called "pulling a yellow ox." Their humor surpasses that of Boerne, even better than Lin Yutang.)</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>We Ningbo people have a highly successful fellow-countryman association in Shanghai. Who doesn't know about it? Who hasn't heard of it? Who would have known there was also a tiny fellow-countryman association, so admirable that it makes people want to prostrate themselves in reverence! It turns out that this small fellow-countryman association has a very perfect organization and very simple articles of association. Although there are fewer than a hundred members, each one is a descendant of scholars and the sons of wealthy men. Because "wealthy people take turns every ten years, and fortune and poverty rotate in the world," inevitably these young masters, feeling adrift in Shanghai, only desire a life of seclusion and leisure and are unwilling to peddle their wares in the marketplace. Therefore, they founded this "Lumpen Proletariat Fellow-Countryman Association" to pursue a life of "seclusion" and "retirement." It is said that the association's address is in a small inn on XX Road. Every morning, the chairman convenes a temporary executive meeting to discuss the association's affairs for the day. After the discussion, Member XXX is appointed as "ferry and transport guest"; Member XXX is appointed as "rear road street runner"; Member XXX, the stock exchange. Once the appointment order is issued, they each set off without delay. It turns out that these places are easy to find old friends or relatives of their fathers' generation, or those with family connections, or old acquaintances, and naturally, it's easy to borrow money from them. After the day's work is completed, they all hand over the money they have obtained to the chairman. Apart from the day's expenses, it is divided fairly and evenly, and each member then happily goes off to do their "playing the transverse flute" work. The next day, they still work hard at their divinely ordained routine, heading off to work separately. Therefore, this "Lumpen Proletariat Fellow-Countryman Association" is flourishing! Song Lian said: "Heaven and earth are the coffin, the sun and moon are the jade for the mouth"; the members of this fellow-countryman association truly have this kind of demeanor!</p>
<h3 id="e276">Imperialism After a Round of Violence <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Zeqing</p>
<p>One Sunday evening, I went to the Da Jiangnan Restaurant to see a friend, but the appointed time had not yet arrived. So I wandered around Beijing Road, idly gazing at the red and green traffic lights, the towering, wooden-faced Indian police officers, the powdered-face, rouged-lip courtesans, the wandering, frivolous young masters, the beast-like capitalist's automobiles, the sharp, haggard faces of beggars under unkempt hair, and so on. Ah! What a rugged and sinful urban night!</p>
<p>"Sir, how do I get to Tilanqiao from here?"</p>
<p>A low voice brushed past my hearing.</p>
<p>At the same time, someone seemed to be tugging at my sleeve. When I turned my head, what came into view was a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old boy with a simple and honest appearance, wearing a student uniform of rice-white "liberty cloth." He was carrying a newspaper satchel (?) under his arm. One could tell at a glance that he was a faithful elementary school student. (?)</p>
<p>"Tilanqiao? It's far! You go to the front, steal a chicken, and take the No. 7 tram. Keep going straight...".</p>
<p>"No! Sir. I'm not taking the tram. I want to walk there. Please, is this the road to get there?"</p>
<p>"Walk there? It's very far! How can I explain it clearly? You don't know the way. It's so late, how can you walk there? Why do you want to walk to Tilanqiao?"</p>
<p>"My home is in Tilanqiao. School let out today. My sister and I went to Sincere Company to buy things. But after getting off the tram, there was a crowd. I couldn't find my sister. I don't know the way either, and the money is with my sister, so I want to run back!"</p>
<p>"Oh! How can I do that? You're so young. How can you run such a long distance? Since that's the case, I'll give you these coins to take the tram back!"</p>
<p>"How can I do that? Thank you too much..." He bashfully lowered his head with childlike innocence.</p>
<p>"Don't be polite. Take it! It's nothing!" I then gave him twenty or so copper coins from my purse and directed him to hurry and take the No. 7 tram heading north.</p>
<p>When I came out of the Da Jiangnan, the clock already pointed to eleven o'clock. However, the people in this big city who were used to nightlife were still as noisy, clamorous, hurried, and bustling as during the day... Dragging my tired body, I turned right towards Nanjing Road—the goal was to get some refreshments.</p>
<p>"Sir! How do I get to Tilanqiao from here?"</p>
<p>This sound brushed past my hearing, and I found it really strange. Why are so many people asking about Tilanqiao today? When I turned my face, I was almost startled into shouting. Wasn't this the child I gave money to on Beijing Road? When he saw my face, he was also particularly flustered. He ran away into the crowd like a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>"Ah! City! Sinful city! This poor, already dead human heart! Who ultimately defiled his pure, innocent soul?" On the way back, I pondered this over and over.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Struggle <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Suxin</p>
<p>The meaning of the two words "struggle" seems to imply that humans or any animal, suffering the pain of being bound, makes a final effort to achieve freedom or survival. Look at chickens or ducks among poultry; when they are about to be slaughtered, their feet are tied with rope; they will definitely struggle and scream there, hoping to obtain a final chance at survival or freedom. Seeing this expression is indeed somewhat pitiful, but in the end, they still cannot escape people's knives because their ability to struggle cannot resist the power of people wanting to kill them, so they can only be slaughtered by humans.</p>
<p>Looking at a country, isn't it always like this? Look at our China. In the past hundred years or so, we have repeatedly failed in diplomacy; therefore, we have lost land, opened treaty ports, established concessions, and signed all kinds of unequal treaties. Even last year, we lost the Northeast. The crisis is imminent, like a rich man encountering bandits and robbers who want both his property and his life, and will not stop until the rich man dies and his wealth is exhausted. Then, if we don't struggle out of the hands of the bandits, can the rich man—China's life and property—be preserved intact?</p>
<p>China is said to be one of the nominally republican and independent countries in the world, not subject to the control of any country. However, looking at the above situation, China is simply surrounded by bandit-like and robber-like powers. How dangerous is the property of the Chinese people? How unfree are all our actions? Therefore, as long as these surrounding bandits—the powers—are not removed one day, China will not have a free and comfortable life for a single day.</p>
<p>Hey! Those young masters embracing women and those gentlemen dancing modern dances with dance girls, and those comrades whose gun muzzles are pointed inward; wake up! Everyone rise up and perk up your spirits, struggle for our own country; break free from the intangible and tangible shackles of those robber-like powers; seize back our property, preserve our lives; and achieve our true, complete freedom and a strong and prosperous country. Wake up! Everyone strive to make a final struggle!</p>

<p>— Yucheng</p>
<p>Yan Shu's courtroom has an unspeakable atmosphere of gloom. The bailiff brings up an underage child. He looks only fourteen or fifteen years old. He stands in the dock with a calm demeanor, showing no signs of fear. (Judge) (After asking his name and age, shakes his head repeatedly and says:) Why don't you learn the right path at such a young age and instead do this illegal thing! You must know: snatching hats may be a small matter, but the crime is the same as other thefts.</p>
